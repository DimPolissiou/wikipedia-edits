The countries are geographically separated by the [[East China Sea]]. Japan has been strongly influenced throughout history by China with its [[Sino-Japanese vocabulary|language]], [[Chinese architecture|architecture]], [[Chinese culture|culture]], [[Religion in China|religion]], [[Chinese philosophy|philosophy]], and [[Chinese law|law]]. When it opened trade relations with the [[Western civilization|West]] in the mid-19th century, Japan plunged itself through an active process of Westernization during the Meiji Restoration in 1868 adopting Western European cultural influences, and began viewing China as an antiquated civilization, unable to defend itself against Western forces in part due to the [[First Opium War|First]] and [[Second Opium War]]s and Anglo-French Expeditions from the 1860s to the 1880s.\n\nAccording to Chinese government, the relationship between China and Japan has been strained at times by Japan's refusal to acknowledge its [[World War II|wartime]] past to the satisfaction of China. However, according to Japanese government, the expansion of [[People's Liberation Army]] and its assertive actions have been damaging the bilateral relation. [[Historical revisionism|Revisionist]] comments made by prominent Japanese officials and some [[Japanese history textbook controversies|Japanese history textbooks]] regarding the 1937 [[Nanking Massacre]] have been a focus of particular controversy. Sino-Japanese relations warmed considerably after [[Shinz\u014d Abe]] became the [[Prime Minister of Japan]] in September 2006, and a joint historical study conducted by China and Japan released a report in 2010 which pointed toward a new consensus on the issue of [[Japanese war crimes]].<ref name=\"Ref_ac\">[https://foreignpolicy.com/articles/2010/02/09/nanjing_by_the_numbers ''Nanjing by the Numbers''].

Also, [[economy of China|China's]] and [[economy of Japan|Japan's]] economies are the world's [[List of countries by GDP (PPP)|first and fourth-largest economies by GDP PPP]]. In 2008, China-Japan trade grew to $266.4 billion, a rise of 12.5 percent on 2007, making China and Japan the top two-way trading partners. China was also the biggest destination for Japanese exports in 2009. Since the end of World War II, Sino-Japanese relations are still mired in tension, which risks the break-out of a conflict in Asia. The enmity between these two countries emanated from the history of the Japanese war and the imperialism and maritime disputes in the East China Sea (Xing, 2011). Thus, as much as these two nations are close business partners, there is an undercurrent of tension, which the leaders from both sides are trying to quell. Chinese President [[Xi Jinping]], Chinese Premier [[Li Keqiang]] and Japanese Prime Minister [[Abe Shinzo]] have met several times face to face to try to build a cordial relationship between the two countries (Fuhrmann, 2016). The main argument among observers and commentators is whether the relationship between China and Japan would remain stable due to their strong bilateral trades or the relationship would collapse due to the historical rivalry and enmity (Xing, 2011).\n\nThere has been increasingly large mutual dislike, hatred, and hostility between Japanese and Chinese people in recent years. According to a 2014 [[BBC]] World Service Poll, 3% of Japanese people view China's influence positively, with 73% expressing a negative view, the most negative perception of China in the world, while 5% of Chinese people view Japanese influence positively, with 90% expressing a negative view, the most negative perception of Japan in the world.<ref>[http://www.globescan.com/images/images/pressreleases/bbc2014_country_ratings/2014_country_rating_poll_bbc_globescan.pdf 2014 World Service Poll] ''[[BBC]]''</ref> A 2014 survey conducted by the [[Pew Research Center]] showed 85% of Japanese were concerned that territorial disputes between China and neighbouring countries could lead to a military conflict.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pewglobal.org/2014/07/14/chapter-4-how-asians-view-each-other/|title=Chapter 4: How Asians View Each Other|publisher=[[Pew Research Center]]|accessdate=10 October 2015|date=2014-07-14}}</ref>\n\nDespite the conflicts, China and Japan have been steadily improving their relationships, with both sides remarking that they will be focusing on developing healthy ties, signalling towards a \"new start\".

Manchuria|Second Sino-Japanese War}}\nChina and Japan are geographically separated only by a relatively narrow stretch of ocean. China has strongly influenced Japan with its writing system, architecture, culture, religion, philosophy, and law. When Western countries forced Japan to open trading in the mid-19th century, Japan moved towards modernization (Meiji Restoration), viewing China as an antiquated civilization, unable to defend itself against Western forces in part due to the First and Second Opium Wars along with Anglo-French Expeditions from the 1840s to the 1860s. Japan's long chain of invasions and war crimes in China between 1894 and 1945 as well as modern Japan's attitude towards its past are major issues affecting current Sino-Japanese relations.\n\n===1950s===\nAfter the establishment of the [[China|People's Republic of China]] (PRC) in 1949, relations with [[Japan]] changed from hostility and an absence of contact to cordiality and extremely close cooperation in many fields. Japan was defeated and [[Japan Self-Defense Forces|Japanese military]] power dismantled but the PRC continued to view Japan as a potential threat because of the presence of [[United States Forces Japan]] in the region. One of the recurring PRC's concerns in Sino-Japanese relations has been the potential re-militarization of Japan. On the other hand, some Japanese fear that the economic and military power of the PRC has been increasing (cf. [[Potential superpowers#China]]).\n\nThe [[Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance]] included the provision that each side would protect the other from an attack by \"Japan or any state allied with it\" and the PRC undoubtedly viewed with alarm Japan's role as the principal US military base during the [[Korean War]]. The [[Treaty of Mutual Cooperation and Security between the United States and Japan]] signed in 1951 also heightened the discouragement of diplomatic relations between the two countries. In 1952 Japan pushed dissension between the two countries even further by concluding a [[Treaty of Taipei|peace treaty]] with the ROC (Republic of China, or Taiwan) and establishing diplomatic relations with the Taiwanese authorities.\n\nLike most Western nations at the time, [[Japan]] had recognized [[Taipei]] as the sole legitimate Chinese government. Initially, neither country allowed its political differences to stand in the way of broadening unofficial contacts, and in the mid-1950s they exchanged an increasing number of cultural, labor, and business delegations.\n\nAlthough all these things complicated the relationship between the two countries, [[Beijing]] orchestrated relations with Japanese [[non-governmental organizations]] (NGO) through primarily the [[Chinese People\u2019s Institute of Foreign Affairs]] (CPIFA).  The CPIFA would receive Japanese politicians from all parties, but the Japanese left-wing parties were more interested in the PRC's initiatives.  In 1952, the [[Chinese Commission for the Promotion of International Trade]] (CCPIT) was able to get a trade agreement signed by the [[Diet of Japan|Japanese Diet]] members. [[Liao Chengzhi]], the deputy director of the [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (People's Republic of China)|State Council's Office of Foreign Affairs]], was able to arrange many other agreements \"such as the repatriation of Japanese prisoners of war with the [[Japanese Red Cross]] (1954), and the [[Fishery Agreement with the Japan-China Fishery Association]] (1955).\"<ref name=Barnouin>{{cite book\n |last=Barnouin\n |first=Barbara\n |author2=Changgen, Yu\n |year=1998\n |title=Chinese Foreign Policy during the Cultural Revolution\n |publisher=Columbia University Press\n |location=New York\n |pages=113\u2013116\n |isbn=0-7103-0580-X\n}}</ref>\nDuring this time, the relationship between the two countries were primarily unofficial. The agreements were essential in bringing together a more amalgamated environment.\n\nThe PRC began a policy of attempting to influence the Japan through trade, \"people's diplomacy\", contacts with Japanese opposition political parties, and through applying pressure on [[Tokyo]] to sever ties with Taipei. In 1958, however, the PRC suspended its trade with Japan\u2014apparently convinced that trade concessions were ineffective in achieving political goals. Thereafter, in a plan for improving political relations, the PRC requested that the Japanese government not be hostile toward it, not obstruct any effort to restore normal relations between itself and Japan, and not join in any conspiracy to create [[One China Policy|two Chinas]].  After the [[Sino-Soviet split|Sino-Soviet break]], economic necessity caused the PRC to reconsider and revitalize trade ties with Japan.\n\n===1960s===\nThe [[Soviet Union]] suddenly withdrew Soviet experts from the PRC in the 1960s, which resulted in an economic dilemma for the PRC. The PRC was left with few options, one of which was to have a more official relationship with [[Japan]].\n\n[[Tatsunosuke Takasaki]], member of the [[Liberal Democratic Party (Japan)|Liberal Democratic Party]] (LDP) and of the Diet and Director of the Economic Planning Agency of the Japanese, went to the PRC in order to sign a memorandum that would further the trade relations between the two countries, better known as the [[Liao-Takasaki Agreement]]. Under its terms, Chinese purchases of industrial plants were to be financed partly through medium-term credits from [[Japan Bank for International Cooperation|Japan Export-Import Bank]] (JEXIM). The accord also permitted the PRC to open a trade mission in [[Tokyo]] and in 1963 paved the way for Japanese government approval of the export to mainland China of a synthetic textile manufacturing plant valued at around [[United States dollar|US$]] 20 million, guaranteed by the bank. Subsequent protest from the ROC caused Japan to shelve further deferred-payment plant exports. The PRC reacted to this change by downgrading its Japan trade and intensified propaganda attacks against Japan as a \"running dog\" ([[Chinese language|Chinese]]:\"\u8d70\u72d7\") of the [[United States]].\nBehind the United States of America, China and Japan take the second and the third position respectively of the largest economies in the world. China and Japan trade approximately $350 billion worth of goods annually with each other (Xing, 2011). This is a huge exchange meaning that the trade ties between these two nations are one of the largest trading partnerships around the world. Economic studies reveal that the economic relationship between China and Japan started a long time ago when China started to import industrial goods to build its manufacturing infrastructure (Fuhrmann, 2016). Some of the goods that were imported include; machinery, equipment, steel mills, and the transportation infrastructure such as bridges, railways, roads and airports. Reports reveal that China major imports these goods from Japan and Germany.\n\nSino-Japanese ties declined again during the [[Cultural Revolution]], and the decline was further exacerbated by [[Japan]]'s growing strength and independence from the [[United States]] in the late 1960s. The PRC was especially concerned that Japan might remilitarize to compensate for the reduced [[United States Pacific Command|US military presence in Asia]] brought about under president [[Richard Nixon]]. As the turmoil subsided, however, the Japanese government\u2013 already under pressure both from the pro-Beijing factions in the LDP and from opposition elements\u2013 sought to adopt a more forward posture.\n\n===1970s===\nIn December 1971, the Chinese and Japanese trade liaison offices began to discuss the possibility of restoring diplomatic trade relations, and in July 1972, [[Kakuei Tanaka]] succeeded [[Eisaku Sat\u014d]] as a new Japanese Prime Minister. Tanaka assumed a normalization of the Sino-Japanese relations. Furthermore, the [[1972 Nixon visit to China]] encouraged the normalization process. His visit to [[Beijing]] culminated in the signing a [[Joint Communiqu\u00e9 of the Government of Japan and the Government of the People's Republic of China|joint statement]] on September 29, 1972. It established diplomatic relations between Japan and the PRC. China renounced its demand for war reparation from Japan. The Japanese agreed on the [[political status of Taiwan]]. Subsequently, the bilateral economic relationships grew rapidly: 28 Japanese and 30 Chinese economic and trade missions visited their partner country.\n\nThe joint communiqu\u00e9 says:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mofa.go.jp/region/asia-paci/china/joint72.html |title=Joint Communique of the Government of Japan and the Government of the People's Republic of China |publisher=MOFA |accessdate=2010-10-04}}</ref>\n\n<blockquote>\n# The abnormal state of affairs that has hitherto existed between Japan and the People's Republic of China is terminated on the date on which this Joint Communique is issued.\n# The Government of Japan recognizes that Government of the People's Republic of China as the sole legal Government of China.\n# The Government of the People's Republic of China reiterates that [[Taiwan]] is an inalienable part of the territory of the People's Republic of China.

The PRC insisted the anti-[[hegemony]] clause, which was directed at the [[Soviet Union]], be included in the treaty. Japan objected the clause and did not wish to get involved in the [[Sino-Soviet split]].\n\nHowever, the death of [[Mao Zedong]] in 1976 brought [[Economic reform in the People's Republic of China|economic reform]] to the PRC, which led to the expected Japanese investment in the Chinese economy.\n\nIn February 1978, a long-term private trade agreement led to an arrangement by which trade between [[Japan]] and the PRC would increase to a level of US$20 billion by 1985, through exports from Japan of plants and equipment, technology, construction materials, and machine parts in return for coal and crude oil.  This long-term plan, which gave rise to inflated expectations, proved overly ambitious and was drastically cut back the following year as the PRC was forced to reorder its development priorities and scale down its commitments.  However, the signing of the agreement reflected the wish on both sides to improve relations.\n\nIn April 1978, a dispute over the territoriality of the [[Senkaku Islands]] (or Diaoyu Islands), a cluster of barren islets north of [[Taiwan]] and south of the [[Ryukyu Islands]] flared up and threatened to disrupt the developing momentum toward resuming peace treaty talks. Restraint on both sides led to a resolution.\n\nAt the end of 1978, the then prime minister Ohira said the government of Japan would offer ODA to China.<ref>{{Cite journal | doi=10.4000/chinaperspectives.358| title=Japan's Changing ODA Policy Towards China| journal=China Perspectives| volume=2003| issue=3| year=2003| last1=Masuda| first1=Masayuki}}</ref> Official Development Assistance (ODA) from Japan to China began in 1979 and from that time to the present, approximately 3.1331 trillion yen in loan aid (yen loans), 145.7 billion yen in grant aid, and 144.6 billion yen in technical cooperation have been implemented up to June 2005 and has not ended.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.mofa.go.jp/policy/oda/region/e_asia/china/ |title = Overview of Official Development Assistance (ODA) to China}}</ref>\n\nTalks on the peace treaty were resumed in July, and the agreement was reached in August on a compromise version of the anti-hegemony clause.<ref>(Article 2) \u201cThe Contracting Parties declare that neither of them should seek [[hegemony]] in the [[Asia-Pacific]] region or in any other region and that each is opposed to efforts by any other country or group of countries to establish such hegemony.\u201d [http://www.mofa.go.jp/region/asia-paci/china/treaty78.html MOFA: Treaty of Peace and Friendship between Japan and the People's Republic of China]</ref> The [[Treaty of Peace and Friendship between Japan and the People's Republic of China]] was signed on August 12 and came into effect October 23, 1978, under the two leaders of [[Deng Xiaoping]] and [[Fukuda Takeo]].\n\n===1980s===\nA \"Golden Age\" marked by the development of complementary interests flourished from the 1980s to the mid-1990s. Sino-Japanese relations made considerable progress in the 1980s.{{citation needed|date=January 2011}}\n\nThe [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of China|General Secretary]] of the [[Communist Party of China]] (CPC), [[Hu Yaobang]], visited Japan in November 1983, and Prime Minister Nakasone reciprocated by visiting the PRC in March 1984.  While Japanese enthusiasm for the Chinese market reached highs and lows, broad strategic considerations in the 1980s steadied [[Tokyo]]'s policy toward Beijing.  In fact, Japan's heavy involvement in the [[Economic reform in the People's Republic of China|PRC's economic modernization]] reflected in part a determination to encourage peaceful domestic development in the PRC, to draw the PRC into gradually expanding links with Japan and the West, and to reduce the PRC's interest in returning to its more provocative foreign policies of the past.\n\nMany of Japan's concerns about the [[Soviet Union]] duplicated PRC's worries.  They included the increased deployment in East Asia of Soviet armaments, the growth of the Soviet Pacific fleet, the [[Soviet\u2013Afghan War|Soviet invasion of Afghanistan]] and the potential threat it posed to [[Persian Gulf]] oil supply routes, and an increased Soviet military presence in [[Vietnam]]. In response, Japan and the PRC adopted notable complementary foreign policies, designed to isolate the Soviet Union and its allies politically and to promote regional stability.\n\nIn Southeast Asia, both countries provided strong diplomatic backing for the efforts of the [[Association of Southeast Asian Nations]] (ASEAN) to bring about a Vietnamese withdrawal from [[Cambodia]]. Japan provided substantial economic assistance to [[Thailand]] to help with resettling Indochinese refugees.  The PRC was a key supporter of Thailand and of the Cambodian resistance groups such as the Khmer Rouge.\n\nIn Southwest Asia, both nations backed the condemnation of the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan; they refused to recognize the Soviet-backed Kabul regime, and sought through diplomatic and economic means to bolster [[Pakistan]].\n\nIn Northeast Asia, [[Japan]] and the PRC sought to moderate the behavior of their Korean partners, [[South Korea]] and [[North Korea]], to reduce tensions.  In 1983 both the PRC and Japan strongly criticized the Soviet proposal to redeploy some of their armaments to Asia.\n\nJapan encountered a number of episodes of friction with the PRC during the rest of the 1980s. In 1982, a serious political controversy was aroused over a revision of Japanese history textbooks dealing with the war between China and Japan during 1931-45 (cf. [[Japanese history textbook controversies]]). In late 1985, Chinese officials complained harshly about Prime Minister [[Nakasone Yasuhiro|Nakasone]]'s visit to the [[Yasukuni Shrine]], which commemorates Japanese soldiers who had died in service of the Emperor some of whom are [[war crime|war criminals]]. See also [http://www.china.org.cn/english/features/43943.htm China Internet information centre: the issue of Guanghualiao].\n\nUnder Prime Minister [[Nakasone Yasuhiro]], the Japanese government reemphasized the relationship to the United States. The U.S. strategic emphasis upon East Asia allegedly shifted the PRC to Japan in 1983. [[Beijing]] felt isolation and concerning anew about possible revival of [[Japanese militarism]]. By the mid-1983, Beijing had decided coincidentally with its decision to improve relations with the [[Ronald Reagan|Reagan]] administration of the [[United States]] to solidify ties with Japan.\n\nEconomic issues centered on Chinese complaints that the influx of Japanese products into the PRC had produced a serious [[trade deficit]] for the PRC.  Nakasone and other Japanese leaders tried to relieve above concerns during visits to [[Beijing]] and in other talks with Chinese officials.  They assured the Chinese of Japan's continued large-scale development and commercial assistance, and to obstruct any Sino-Soviet realignment against Japan. The two countries also concluded a bilateral investment treaty in 1988 after seven years of tough negotiation, where China finally agreed to grant Japanese investments with \"national treatment\".<ref>Hagstr\u00f6m, Linus (2005) Japan's China Policy: A Relational Power Analysis, London and New York: Routledge http://www.routledge.com/books/details/9780415346795/.</ref>\n\nAt the popular level in the PRC, it was not easy to allay concerns.  Student-led demonstrations against Japan (cf. [[Anti-Japanese sentiment in China]]), on the one hand, helped reinforce Chinese officials' warnings to their Japanese counterparts.  On the other hand, it was more difficult to change popular opinion in the PRC than it was to change the opinions of the Chinese officials.\n\nMeanwhile, the removal of the General Secretary of the CPC, [[Hu Yaobang]], in 1987 was detrimental to smooth Sino-Japanese relations because Hu had built personal relationships with Nakasone and other Japanese leaders. The PRC government's harsh crackdown on pro-[[democracy]] demonstrations in the spring of 1989 caused Japanese policymakers to realize that the new situation in the PRC was extremely delicate and required careful handling to avoid Japanese actions that would push the PRC further away from reforms.  [[Beijing]] leaders reportedly judged at first that the industrialized countries would relatively quickly resume normal business with the PRC after a brief period of complaint over the [[Tiananmen Square protests of 1989]].  When that did not happen, the PRC officials made strong suggestions to Japanese officials that they break from most industrialized nations by pursuing normal economic intercourse with the PRC, consistent with [[Tokyo]]'s long-term interests in mainland China.  Japanese leaders like West European and U.S. leaders were careful not to isolate the PRC and continued trade and other relations generally consistent with the policies of other industrialized democracies.  But they also followed the [[United States]] lead in limiting economic relations to the PRC.\n\n===1990s===\n[[File:HiroshimaChengduCenter000.jpg|thumb|The Hiroshima-Sichuan Sino-Japanese Friendship Convention Center (Japanese: \u5e83\u5cf6\u30fb\u56db\u5ddd\u4e2d\u65e5\u53cb\u597d\u4f1a\u9928, Simplified Chinese: \u5e7f\u5c9b\u30fb\u56db\u5ddd\u4e2d\u65e5\u53cb\u597d\u4f1a\u9986) in [[Wuhou District]], [[Chengdu]]]]\nBilateral structural change developed during the late 1990s to 2004. Japan had been investing in the PRC during the early 1990s, and trade decreased during the late 1990s, but resurged at the millennium. The resurgence might have been because of the prospect of the PRC becoming a part of the [[World Trade Organization]] (WTO).\n\n===2000s===\nBy 2001 China's international trade was the sixth-largest in the world; and over the next several years it was expected to be just under Japan, the fourth largest.\n\nIn early 2005, Japan and the [[United States]] had issued a joint statement which addresses [[political status of Taiwan|issues concerning the Taiwan Strait]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mofa.go.jp/region/n-america/us/security/scc/joint0502.html |title=Joint Statement U.S.-Japan Security Consultative Committee |publisher=MOFA |date=2005-02-19 |accessdate=2010-10-04}}</ref> The PRC was angered by the statement, and protested the interference in its internal affairs.<ref>an argument China uses often to support their nationalistic aims</ref> The [[Anti-Secession Law]] was passed by the third conference of the 10th [[National People's Congress]] of the PRC, and was ratified in March 2005, and then the law went into effect immediately. Subsequently, [[2005 anti-Japanese demonstrations|anti-Japanese demonstrations]] took place simultaneously in the PRC and other Asian countries.\n\nHowever, the \"warm\" relationship between the PRC and Japan had been revived by two Japanese Prime Ministers, [[Shinzo Abe]] and particularly [[Yasuo Fukuda]] whose father achieved to conclude the [[Treaty of Peace and Friendship between Japan and the People's Republic of China]]. In May 2008, [[Hu Jintao]] was the first [[paramount leader]] of China in over a decade to be invited to Japan on an official visit, and called for increased \"co-operation\" between the two countries. A \"forth\" joint statement<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mofa.go.jp/region/asia-paci/china/joint0805.html |title=Joint Statement between the Government of Japan and the Government of the People's Republic of China on Comprehensive Promotion of a \"Mutually Beneficial Relationship Based on Common Strategic Interests\" (May 7, 2008) |publisher=MOFA |accessdate=2010-10-04}}</ref> by President Hu and Japanese Prime Minister Yasuo Fukuda read:\n\n<blockquote>\n\"The two sides resolved to face history squarely, advance toward the future, and endeavor with persistence to create a new era of a \"mutually beneficial relationship based on common strategic interests\" between Japan and China.

In 2012, China\u2019s gross GDP was 1.4 times as big as Japan\u2019s. In the next three to five years, the Chinese economy is on track to grow to twice the size of Japan\u2019s. As a matter of fact, Japan was quite reluctant to witness China\u2019s incredible economic growth and therefore had increased its vigilance towards China by viewing China as its biggest threat under Prime Minister Abe\u2019s leadership currently. <ref>{{cite web |url=https://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20100816/ap_on_bi_ge/as_japan_economy;_ylt=As4hhu.nH4lmeEzte4h.aJxY_aF4;_ylu=X3oDMTM1c2tpc3R0BGFzc2V0A2FwLzIwMTAwODE2L2FzX2phcGFuX2Vjb25vbXkEY2NvZGUDbW9zdHBvcHVsYXIEY3BvcwM3BHBvcwM3BHNlYwN5bl90b3Bfc3RvcmllcwRzbGsDY2hpbmFvdmVydGFr |title=China surges past Japan as No. 2 economy; US next? |publisher=News.yahoo.com |accessdate=2010-10-04 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100824195655/http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20100816/ap_on_bi_ge/as_japan_economy |archive-date=2010-08-24 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nChinese animosity or even hatred of Japan is reflected in the popular culture. American reporter Howard French states in 2017:\n:to turn on the television in China is to be inundated with war-themed movies, which overwhelmingly focus on Japanese villainy.  More than 200 anti-Japanese films were produced in 2012 alone, with one scholar calculating that 70% of Chinese TV dramas involved  Japan-related  war plots....A prominent Chinese foreign-policy thinker who has had extensive contact with the country's leadership told me, \"in meetings since Xi has been in power [2012] you could feel the hatred.  Everything is about punishing  Japan.  Punishing this damned [Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo] Abe.\" The most high-profile action that hurt the bilateral relations would be Japanese Prime Ministers\u2019 visits to Yasukuni Shrine, a place considered by most Chinese nationals as offensive because many WWII Japanese military criminals are worshipped there. China-Japan relations reached to the lowest point since the previous Prime Minister Koizumi\u2019s term because of his visit to the shrine. Nonetheless, Prime Minister Abe Shinzo also visited Yasukuni Shrine many times after he got re-elected in 2010, which triggered furious anti-Japanese protests in China due to the negative attitudes and perceptions between the two nations. In a sense, both Koizumi and Abe made \u201cmaverick behavior\u201d, in specific making visits to the Yasukuni Shrine as the proof to exhibit nationalism ideology, which endangered the China-Japan relations into the worst phase.\n<ref>{{cite book|author=Howard W.

Therefore, this article describes the above two issues in the following.\n\n===Issue of history===\n{{Main|Japanese history textbook controversies|Rape of Nanking|Yasukuni Shrine|Unit 731}}\nThe PRC joined other Asian countries, such as [[South Korea]], [[North Korea]] and [[Singapore]], in criticizing Japanese history textbooks that whiten [[Japanese war crimes]] in [[World War II]]. They claimed that the rise of [[militarism]] became evident in Japanese politics. Much [[anti-Japanese sentiment]] has raised, and this has been exacerbated by burgeoning feelings of [[Chinese nationalism]] and former Prime Minister [[Junichiro Koizumi]]'s visits to the [[Yasukuni Shrine]].<ref>A [[Jinja (Shinto)|Shinto shrine]] that offers prayers for the war dead including 14 Class A [[war crime|war criminals]]</ref> Although Koizumi openly declared\u2013 in a statement made on April 22, 2005 in [[Jakarta]]\u2013 \"deep remorse\" over [[Japan]]'s wartime crimes (the latest in a series of apologies spanning several decades), many Chinese observers regard the apology as insufficient and not backed up by sincere action.<ref>with more than 80 Parliament members and a Cabinet minister making a pilgrimage to the [[Yasukuni Shrine]] just hours earlier{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}</ref>\n\nThere also remains the dispute over the [[Senkaku Islands]] (Diaoyu Islands), which resulted in clashes between Taiwanese (Chinese) protesters and the Japanese government in April 2005. The incident led to anti-Japanese protests and sporadic violence across the PRC, from [[Beijing]] to [[Shanghai]], later [[Guangzhou]], [[Shenzhen]] and [[Shenyang]].<ref>{{cite news |last1=York |first1=Geoffrey |title=In China's streets, massive protests . . . |url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/world/in-chinas-streets-massive-protests/article18220620/ |accessdate=January 25, 2020 |work=The Globe and Mail |date=April 11, 2005}}</ref> In August 2012, Hong Kong activists landed on one of the disputed Diaoyu/Senkaku Islands, and Japanese nationalists responded by landing on the island the following week.

The PRC claims that at least 300,000 civilians were murdered while Japan claims a far less figure of 40,000-200,000.  While a majority of Japanese believe in the existence of the massacre, a [[Cinema of Japan|Japanese]]-produced [[documentary film]] released just prior to the 60th anniversary of the massacre, titled ''[[The Truth about Nanjing]]'', denies that any such atrocities took place. These disputes have stirred up enmity against Japan from the global Chinese community, including [[Taiwan]].\n\n====Japan's compensation====\nFrom late 19th century to early 20th century, one of the many factors contributing to the bankruptcy of the Qing government was Japan's requirement for large amount of war reparations. China paid huge amounts of silver to Japan under various treaties, including the [[Sino-Japanese Friendship and Trade Treaty]] (1871), [[Treaty of Shimonoseki]] (1895), the [[Triple Intervention]] (1895) and the [[Boxer Protocol]] (1901).  After the [[First Sino-Japanese War]] in 1894\u201395, the Qing government paid a total of 200,000,000 taels of silver to Japan for reparations.<ref>{{cite book|author=Zhiguo Kong|title=The Making of a Maritime Power: China's Challenges and Policy Responses|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yhRVDQAAQBAJ&pg=PA5|year=2016|publisher=Springer|page=5|isbn=9789811017865}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Second Sino-Japanese War]] 1936-1945 also caused huge economic losses to China.  However, [[Chiang Kai-shek]] waived reparations claims for the [[Second Sino-Japanese War|war]] when the ROC concluded the [[Treaty of Taipei]] with Japan in 1952. Similarly, when Japan normalized its relations with the [[People's Republic of China|PRC]] in 1972, [[Mao Zedong]] waived the claim of war reparations from Japan.<ref>See the Article 5 of [[Joint Communiqu\u00e9 of the Government of Japan and the Government of the People's Republic of China]] in 1972.</ref>\n\nEx-[[Japanese Prime Minister]] [[Hatoyama Yukio]] offered personal apology for Japan's wartime crimes, especially the [[Nanking Massacre]], \"As a Japanese citizen, I feel that it's my duty to apologise for even just one Chinese civilian killed brutally by Japanese soldiers and that such action cannot be excused by saying that it occurred during war.\"<ref>[http://www.scmp.com/news/china/article/1355427/former-japanese-pm-yukio-hatoyama-apologises-atrocities-china Former Japanese PM Yukio Hatoyama apologises for atrocities in China]</ref>\n\n===Issue of Taiwan===\n{{Main|Political status of Taiwan}}\nThe Japan\u2013Taiwan official split is one of the fundamental principles of Sino-Japanese relations. The PRC emphasises [[Taiwan]] is a part of China and the PRC is the only legal government of China (cf. [[One-China policy]]). By the [[Joint Communiqu\u00e9 of the Government of Japan and the Government of the People's Republic of China|1972 agreement]], the [[Treaty of Taipei]] was argued to be invalid.\n\nWhen the PRC\u2013Japan normalization was concerned, the PRC had been worried about some Japanese pro-[[Taiwan independence]] politicians. At the same time, the [[Treaty of Mutual Cooperation and Security between the United States and Japan]] (1960\u2013 ) has been a big problem for the PRC. In a point of the PRC's view, the military alliance treaty implicitly directs to the [[Taiwan Strait]]. It has become a big factor for Taiwan security affairs.\n\n===Human rights===\nIn July 2019, the UN ambassadors from 22 nations, including Japan, signed a joint letter to the [[United Nations Human Rights Council|UNHRC]] condemning China\u2019s mistreatment of the [[Uyghurs]] as well as of other minority groups, urging the Chinese government to close the [[Xinjiang re-education camps]].<ref>{{cite news |title=Which Countries Are For or Against China's Xinjiang Policies? |url=https://thediplomat.com/2019/07/which-countries-are-for-or-against-chinas-xinjiang-policies/ |work=[[The Diplomat]] |date=15 July 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=More than 20 ambassadors condemn China's treatment of Uighurs in Xinjiang |url=https://amp.theguardian.com/world/2019/jul/11/more-than-20-ambassadors-condemn-chinas-treatment-of-uighurs-in-xinjiang |work=The Guardian|date=11 July 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Public perception of relations==\n{{As of|2017}}, about 64.2% of Chinese citizens think that the status of the bilateral relationship is bad, compared to 44.9%, the percentage of Japanese citizens who hold the same view. This is a significant drop compared to 2016, where 78.2% and 71.9% of Chinese and Japanese citizens, respectively, held a negative perception of the relationship. The perception of the future of these ties has also gotten better, with 29.7% and 23.6% of Chinese and Japanese citizens, again respectively, expecting relations to worsen, and 28.7% and 13.1% predicting that the relations will get better. The improving view of the status of China\u2013Japan relations has been attributed to more communication between political leaders, a lack of \"big issues\", and the overshadowing of problems in the relationship by problems with North Korea.<ref name=\"jtviewsimproved\">{{cite news| title = Japanese and Chinese views on recent ties have greatly improved, poll shows| newspaper = The Japan Times| date = 14 December 2017| url = https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2017/12/14/national/politics-diplomacy/japanese-chinese-views-recent-ties-greatly-improved-poll-shows/}}</ref> Survey published in 2019 by the [[Pew Research Center]] found that 85% of Japanese had an unfavourable view of China.<ref>{{cite news |title=Public opinion on China turns negative in Western Europe and Asia-Pacific, survey finds |url=https://www.scmp.com/news/china/diplomacy/article/3031142/public-opinion-china-turns-negative-western-europe-and-asia |work=South China Morning Post |date=2 October 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=People around the globe are divided in their opinions of China |url=https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2019/09/30/people-around-the-globe-are-divided-in-their-opinions-of-china/ |work=Pew Research Center |date=30 September 2019}}</ref>\n\n==VIP Inter-visits==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ From Japan to China\n!

The countries are geographically separated by the [[East China Sea]]. Japan has been strongly influenced throughout history by China with its [[Sino-Japanese vocabulary|language]], [[Chinese architecture|architecture]], [[Chinese culture|culture]], [[Religion in China|religion]], [[Chinese philosophy|philosophy]], and [[Chinese law|law]]. When it opened trade relations with the [[Western civilization|West]] in the mid-19th century, Japan plunged itself through an active process of Westernization during the Meiji Restoration in 1868 adopting Western European cultural influences, and began viewing China as an antiquated civilization, unable to defend itself against Western forces in part due to the [[First Opium War|First]] and [[Second Opium War]]s and Anglo-French Expeditions from the 1860s to the 1880s.\n\nAccording to Chinese government, the relationship between China and Japan has been strained at times by Japan's refusal to acknowledge its [[World War II|wartime]] past to the satisfaction of China. However, according to Japanese government, the expansion of [[People's Liberation Army]] and its assertive actions have been damaging the bilateral relation. [[Historical revisionism|Revisionist]] comments made by prominent Japanese officials and some [[Japanese history textbook controversies|Japanese history textbooks]] regarding the 1937 [[Nanking Massacre]] have been a focus of particular controversy. Sino-Japanese relations warmed considerably after [[Shinz\u014d Abe]] became the [[Prime Minister of Japan]] in September 2006, and a joint historical study conducted by China and Japan released a report in 2010 which pointed toward a new consensus on the issue of [[Japanese war crimes]].<ref name=\"Ref_ac\">[https://foreignpolicy.com/articles/2010/02/09/nanjing_by_the_numbers ''Nanjing by the Numbers''].

Also, [[economy of China|China's]] and [[economy of Japan|Japan's]] economies are the world's [[List of countries by GDP (PPP)|first and fourth-largest economies by GDP PPP]]. In 2008, China-Japan trade grew to $266.4 billion, a rise of 12.5 percent on 2007, making China and Japan the top two-way trading partners. China was also the biggest destination for Japanese exports in 2009. Since the end of World War II, Sino-Japanese relations are still mired in tension, which risks the break-out of a conflict in Asia. The enmity between these two countries emanated from the history of the Japanese war and the imperialism and maritime disputes in the East China Sea (Xing, 2011). Thus, as much as these two nations are close business partners, there is an undercurrent of tension, which the leaders from both sides are trying to quell. Chinese President [[Xi Jinping]], Chinese Premier [[Li Keqiang]] and Japanese Prime Minister [[Abe Shinzo]] have met several times face to face to try to build a cordial relationship between the two countries (Fuhrmann, 2016). The main argument among observers and commentators is whether the relationship between China and Japan would remain stable due to their strong bilateral trades or the relationship would collapse due to the historical rivalry and enmity (Xing, 2011).\n\nThere has been increasingly large mutual dislike, hatred, and hostility between Japanese and Chinese people in recent years. According to a 2014 [[BBC]] World Service Poll, 3% of Japanese people view China's influence positively, with 73% expressing a negative view, the most negative perception of China in the world, while 5% of Chinese people view Japanese influence positively, with 90% expressing a negative view, the most negative perception of Japan in the world.<ref>[http://www.globescan.com/images/images/pressreleases/bbc2014_country_ratings/2014_country_rating_poll_bbc_globescan.pdf 2014 World Service Poll] ''[[BBC]]''</ref> A 2014 survey conducted by the [[Pew Research Center]] showed 85% of Japanese were concerned that territorial disputes between China and neighbouring countries could lead to a military conflict.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pewglobal.org/2014/07/14/chapter-4-how-asians-view-each-other/|title=Chapter 4: How Asians View Each Other|publisher=[[Pew Research Center]]|accessdate=10 October 2015|date=2014-07-14}}</ref>\n\nDespite the conflicts, China and Japan have been steadily improving their relationships, with both sides remarking that they will be focusing on developing healthy ties, signalling towards a \"new start\".

Manchuria|Second Sino-Japanese War}}\nChina and Japan are geographically separated only by a relatively narrow stretch of ocean. China has strongly influenced Japan with its writing system, architecture, culture, religion, philosophy, and law. When Western countries forced Japan to open trading in the mid-19th century, Japan moved towards modernization (Meiji Restoration), viewing China as an antiquated civilization, unable to defend itself against Western forces in part due to the First and Second Opium Wars along with Anglo-French Expeditions from the 1840s to the 1860s. Japan's long chain of invasions and war crimes in China between 1894 and 1945 as well as modern Japan's attitude towards its past are major issues affecting current Sino-Japanese relations.\n\n===1950s===\nAfter the establishment of the [[China|People's Republic of China]] (PRC) in 1949, relations with [[Japan]] changed from hostility and an absence of contact to cordiality and extremely close cooperation in many fields. Japan was defeated and [[Japan Self-Defense Forces|Japanese military]] power dismantled but the PRC continued to view Japan as a potential threat because of the presence of [[United States Forces Japan]] in the region. One of the recurring PRC's concerns in Sino-Japanese relations has been the potential re-militarization of Japan. On the other hand, some Japanese fear that the economic and military power of the PRC has been increasing (cf. [[Potential superpowers#China]]).\n\nThe [[Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance]] included the provision that each side would protect the other from an attack by \"Japan or any state allied with it\" and the PRC undoubtedly viewed with alarm Japan's role as the principal US military base during the [[Korean War]]. The [[Treaty of Mutual Cooperation and Security between the United States and Japan]] signed in 1951 also heightened the discouragement of diplomatic relations between the two countries. In 1952 Japan pushed dissension between the two countries even further by concluding a [[Treaty of Taipei|peace treaty]] with the ROC (Republic of China, or Taiwan) and establishing diplomatic relations with the Taiwanese authorities.\n\nLike most Western nations at the time, [[Japan]] had recognized [[Taipei]] as the sole legitimate Chinese government. Initially, neither country allowed its political differences to stand in the way of broadening unofficial contacts, and in the mid-1950s they exchanged an increasing number of cultural, labor, and business delegations.\n\nAlthough all these things complicated the relationship between the two countries, [[Beijing]] orchestrated relations with Japanese [[non-governmental organizations]] (NGO) through primarily the [[Chinese People\u2019s Institute of Foreign Affairs]] (CPIFA).  The CPIFA would receive Japanese politicians from all parties, but the Japanese left-wing parties were more interested in the PRC's initiatives.  In 1952, the [[Chinese Commission for the Promotion of International Trade]] (CCPIT) was able to get a trade agreement signed by the [[Diet of Japan|Japanese Diet]] members. [[Liao Chengzhi]], the deputy director of the [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (People's Republic of China)|State Council's Office of Foreign Affairs]], was able to arrange many other agreements \"such as the repatriation of Japanese prisoners of war with the [[Japanese Red Cross]] (1954), and the [[Fishery Agreement with the Japan-China Fishery Association]] (1955).\"<ref name=Barnouin>{{cite book\n |last=Barnouin\n |first=Barbara\n |author2=Changgen, Yu\n |year=1998\n |title=Chinese Foreign Policy during the Cultural Revolution\n |publisher=Columbia University Press\n |location=New York\n |pages=113\u2013116\n |isbn=0-7103-0580-X\n}}</ref>\nDuring this time, the relationship between the two countries were primarily unofficial. The agreements were essential in bringing together a more amalgamated environment.\n\nThe PRC began a policy of attempting to influence the Japan through trade, \"people's diplomacy\", contacts with Japanese opposition political parties, and through applying pressure on [[Tokyo]] to sever ties with Taipei. In 1958, however, the PRC suspended its trade with Japan\u2014apparently convinced that trade concessions were ineffective in achieving political goals. Thereafter, in a plan for improving political relations, the PRC requested that the Japanese government not be hostile toward it, not obstruct any effort to restore normal relations between itself and Japan, and not join in any conspiracy to create [[One China Policy|two Chinas]].  After the [[Sino-Soviet split|Sino-Soviet break]], economic necessity caused the PRC to reconsider and revitalize trade ties with Japan.\n\n===1960s===\nThe [[Soviet Union]] suddenly withdrew Soviet experts from the PRC in the 1960s, which resulted in an economic dilemma for the PRC. The PRC was left with few options, one of which was to have a more official relationship with [[Japan]].\n\n[[Tatsunosuke Takasaki]], member of the [[Liberal Democratic Party (Japan)|Liberal Democratic Party]] (LDP) and of the Diet and Director of the Economic Planning Agency of the Japanese, went to the PRC in order to sign a memorandum that would further the trade relations between the two countries, better known as the [[Liao-Takasaki Agreement]]. Under its terms, Chinese purchases of industrial plants were to be financed partly through medium-term credits from [[Japan Bank for International Cooperation|Japan Export-Import Bank]] (JEXIM). The accord also permitted the PRC to open a trade mission in [[Tokyo]] and in 1963 paved the way for Japanese government approval of the export to mainland China of a synthetic textile manufacturing plant valued at around [[United States dollar|US$]] 20 million, guaranteed by the bank. Subsequent protest from the ROC caused Japan to shelve further deferred-payment plant exports. The PRC reacted to this change by downgrading its Japan trade and intensified propaganda attacks against Japan as a \"running dog\" ([[Chinese language|Chinese]]:\"\u8d70\u72d7\") of the [[United States]].\nBehind the United States of America, China and Japan take the second and the third position respectively of the largest economies in the world. China and Japan trade approximately $350 billion worth of goods annually with each other (Xing, 2011). This is a huge exchange meaning that the trade ties between these two nations are one of the largest trading partnerships around the world. Economic studies reveal that the economic relationship between China and Japan started a long time ago when China started to import industrial goods to build its manufacturing infrastructure (Fuhrmann, 2016). Some of the goods that were imported include; machinery, equipment, steel mills, and the transportation infrastructure such as bridges, railways, roads and airports. Reports reveal that China major imports these goods from Japan and Germany.\n\nSino-Japanese ties declined again during the [[Cultural Revolution]], and the decline was further exacerbated by [[Japan]]'s growing strength and independence from the [[United States]] in the late 1960s. The PRC was especially concerned that Japan might remilitarize to compensate for the reduced [[United States Pacific Command|US military presence in Asia]] brought about under president [[Richard Nixon]]. As the turmoil subsided, however, the Japanese government\u2013 already under pressure both from the pro-Beijing factions in the LDP and from opposition elements\u2013 sought to adopt a more forward posture.\n\n===1970s===\nIn December 1971, the Chinese and Japanese trade liaison offices began to discuss the possibility of restoring diplomatic trade relations, and in July 1972, [[Kakuei Tanaka]] succeeded [[Eisaku Sat\u014d]] as a new Japanese Prime Minister. Tanaka assumed a normalization of the Sino-Japanese relations. Furthermore, the [[1972 Nixon visit to China]] encouraged the normalization process. His visit to [[Beijing]] culminated in the signing a [[Joint Communiqu\u00e9 of the Government of Japan and the Government of the People's Republic of China|joint statement]] on September 29, 1972. It established diplomatic relations between Japan and the PRC. China renounced its demand for war reparation from Japan. The Japanese agreed on the [[political status of Taiwan]]. Subsequently, the bilateral economic relationships grew rapidly: 28 Japanese and 30 Chinese economic and trade missions visited their partner country.\n\nThe joint communiqu\u00e9 says:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mofa.go.jp/region/asia-paci/china/joint72.html |title=Joint Communique of the Government of Japan and the Government of the People's Republic of China |publisher=MOFA |accessdate=2010-10-04}}</ref>\n\n<blockquote>\n# The abnormal state of affairs that has hitherto existed between Japan and the People's Republic of China is terminated on the date on which this Joint Communique is issued.\n# The Government of Japan recognizes that Government of the People's Republic of China as the sole legal Government of China.\n# The Government of the People's Republic of China reiterates that [[Taiwan]] is an inalienable part of the territory of the People's Republic of China. The Government of Japan fully understands and respects this stand of the Government of the People's Republic of China, and it firmly maintains its stand under Article 8 of the [[Potsdam Declaration|Potsdam Proclamation]].\n# The Government of Japan and the Government of People's Republic of China have decided to establish diplomatic relations as from September 29, 1972. The two Governments have decided to take all necessary measures for the establishment and the performance of the functions of each other's embassy in their respective capitals in accordance with international law and practice, and to exchange ambassadors as speedily as possible.\n# The Government of the People's Republic of China declares that in the interest of the friendship between the Chinese and the Japanese peoples, it renounces its demand for war reparation from Japan.\n# The Government of Japan and the Government of the People's Republic of China agree to establish relations of perpetual peace and friendship between the two countries on the basis of the principles of mutual respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity, mutual non-aggression, non-interference in each other's internal affairs, equality and mutual benefit and peaceful co-existence. The two Governments confirm that, in conformity with the foregoing principles and the principles of the Charter of the United Nations, Japan and China shall in their mutual relations settle all disputes by peaceful means and shall refrain from the use or threat of force.\n# The normalization of relations between Japan and China is not directed against any third country. Neither of the two countries should seek hegemony in the Asia-Pacific region and each is opposed to efforts by any other country or group of countries to establish such hegemony.\n# The Government of Japan and the Government of the People's Republic of China have agreed that, with a view to solidifying and developing the relations of peace and friendship between the two countries, the two Governments will enter into negotiations for the purpose of concluding a treaty of peace and friendship.\n# The Government of Japan and the Government of the People's Republic of China have agreed that, with a view to further promoting relations between the two countries and to expanding interchanges of people, the two Governments will, as necessary and taking account of the existing non-governmental arrangements, enter into negotiations for the purpose of concluding agreements concerning such matters as trade, shipping, aviation, and fisheries.\n</blockquote>\n\nOn 5 February 1973, the PRC and Japan agreed to reestablish diplomatic relations.<ref name=\"World Book\">{{cite encyclopedia |encyclopedia=[[World Book Encyclopedia|The World Book Year Book 1974]] |title=Chronology 1973 |year=1974 |publisher=[[Field Enterprises|Field Enterprises Educational Corporation]] |location=[[Chicago]] |isbn=0-7166-0474-4 |lccn=62-4818 |page=[https://archive.org/details/1974worldbookyea00fiel/page/8 8] |url=https://archive.org/details/1974worldbookyea00fiel/page/8 }}</ref> Negotiations for a Sino-Japanese peace and friendship treaty began in 1974, but soon broken off in September 1975. The PRC insisted the anti-[[hegemony]] clause, which was directed at the [[Soviet Union]], be included in the treaty. Japan objected the clause and did not wish to get involved in the [[Sino-Soviet split]].\n\nHowever, the death of [[Mao Zedong]] in 1976 brought [[Economic reform in the People's Republic of China|economic reform]] to the PRC, which led to the expected Japanese investment in the Chinese economy.\n\nIn February 1978, a long-term private trade agreement led to an arrangement by which trade between [[Japan]] and the PRC would increase to a level of US$20 billion by 1985, through exports from Japan of plants and equipment, technology, construction materials, and machine parts in return for coal and crude oil.  This long-term plan, which gave rise to inflated expectations, proved overly ambitious and was drastically cut back the following year as the PRC was forced to reorder its development priorities and scale down its commitments.  However, the signing of the agreement reflected the wish on both sides to improve relations.\n\nIn April 1978, a dispute over the territoriality of the [[Senkaku Islands]] (or Diaoyu Islands), a cluster of barren islets north of [[Taiwan]] and south of the [[Ryukyu Islands]] flared up and threatened to disrupt the developing momentum toward resuming peace treaty talks. Restraint on both sides led to a resolution.\n\nAt the end of 1978, the then prime minister Ohira said the government of Japan would offer ODA to China.<ref>{{Cite journal | doi=10.4000/chinaperspectives.358| title=Japan's Changing ODA Policy Towards China| journal=China Perspectives| volume=2003| issue=3| year=2003| last1=Masuda| first1=Masayuki}}</ref> Official Development Assistance (ODA) from Japan to China began in 1979 and from that time to the present, approximately 3.1331 trillion yen in loan aid (yen loans), 145.7 billion yen in grant aid, and 144.6 billion yen in technical cooperation have been implemented up to June 2005 and has not ended.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.mofa.go.jp/policy/oda/region/e_asia/china/ |title = Overview of Official Development Assistance (ODA) to China}}</ref>\n\nTalks on the peace treaty were resumed in July, and the agreement was reached in August on a compromise version of the anti-hegemony clause.<ref>(Article 2) \u201cThe Contracting Parties declare that neither of them should seek [[hegemony]] in the [[Asia-Pacific]] region or in any other region and that each is opposed to efforts by any other country or group of countries to establish such hegemony.\u201d [http://www.mofa.go.jp/region/asia-paci/china/treaty78.html MOFA: Treaty of Peace and Friendship between Japan and the People's Republic of China]</ref> The [[Treaty of Peace and Friendship between Japan and the People's Republic of China]] was signed on August 12 and came into effect October 23, 1978, under the two leaders of [[Deng Xiaoping]] and [[Fukuda Takeo]].\n\n===1980s===\nA \"Golden Age\" marked by the development of complementary interests flourished from the 1980s to the mid-1990s. Sino-Japanese relations made considerable progress in the 1980s.{{citation needed|date=January 2011}}\n\nThe [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of China|General Secretary]] of the [[Communist Party of China]] (CPC), [[Hu Yaobang]], visited Japan in November 1983, and Prime Minister Nakasone reciprocated by visiting the PRC in March 1984.  While Japanese enthusiasm for the Chinese market reached highs and lows, broad strategic considerations in the 1980s steadied [[Tokyo]]'s policy toward Beijing.  In fact, Japan's heavy involvement in the [[Economic reform in the People's Republic of China|PRC's economic modernization]] reflected in part a determination to encourage peaceful domestic development in the PRC, to draw the PRC into gradually expanding links with Japan and the West, and to reduce the PRC's interest in returning to its more provocative foreign policies of the past.\n\nMany of Japan's concerns about the [[Soviet Union]] duplicated PRC's worries.  They included the increased deployment in East Asia of Soviet armaments, the growth of the Soviet Pacific fleet, the [[Soviet\u2013Afghan War|Soviet invasion of Afghanistan]] and the potential threat it posed to [[Persian Gulf]] oil supply routes, and an increased Soviet military presence in [[Vietnam]]. In response, Japan and the PRC adopted notable complementary foreign policies, designed to isolate the Soviet Union and its allies politically and to promote regional stability.\n\nIn Southeast Asia, both countries provided strong diplomatic backing for the efforts of the [[Association of Southeast Asian Nations]] (ASEAN) to bring about a Vietnamese withdrawal from [[Cambodia]]. Japan provided substantial economic assistance to [[Thailand]] to help with resettling Indochinese refugees.  The PRC was a key supporter of Thailand and of the Cambodian resistance groups such as the Khmer Rouge.\n\nIn Southwest Asia, both nations backed the condemnation of the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan; they refused to recognize the Soviet-backed Kabul regime, and sought through diplomatic and economic means to bolster [[Pakistan]].\n\nIn Northeast Asia, [[Japan]] and the PRC sought to moderate the behavior of their Korean partners, [[South Korea]] and [[North Korea]], to reduce tensions.  In 1983 both the PRC and Japan strongly criticized the Soviet proposal to redeploy some of their armaments to Asia.\n\nJapan encountered a number of episodes of friction with the PRC during the rest of the 1980s. In 1982, a serious political controversy was aroused over a revision of Japanese history textbooks dealing with the war between China and Japan during 1931-45 (cf. [[Japanese history textbook controversies]]). In late 1985, Chinese officials complained harshly about Prime Minister [[Nakasone Yasuhiro|Nakasone]]'s visit to the [[Yasukuni Shrine]], which commemorates Japanese soldiers who had died in service of the Emperor some of whom are [[war crime|war criminals]]. See also [http://www.china.org.cn/english/features/43943.htm China Internet information centre: the issue of Guanghualiao].\n\nUnder Prime Minister [[Nakasone Yasuhiro]], the Japanese government reemphasized the relationship to the United States. The U.S. strategic emphasis upon East Asia allegedly shifted the PRC to Japan in 1983. [[Beijing]] felt isolation and concerning anew about possible revival of [[Japanese militarism]]. By the mid-1983, Beijing had decided coincidentally with its decision to improve relations with the [[Ronald Reagan|Reagan]] administration of the [[United States]] to solidify ties with Japan.\n\nEconomic issues centered on Chinese complaints that the influx of Japanese products into the PRC had produced a serious [[trade deficit]] for the PRC.  Nakasone and other Japanese leaders tried to relieve above concerns during visits to [[Beijing]] and in other talks with Chinese officials.  They assured the Chinese of Japan's continued large-scale development and commercial assistance, and to obstruct any Sino-Soviet realignment against Japan. The two countries also concluded a bilateral investment treaty in 1988 after seven years of tough negotiation, where China finally agreed to grant Japanese investments with \"national treatment\".<ref>Hagstr\u00f6m, Linus (2005) Japan's China Policy: A Relational Power Analysis, London and New York: Routledge http://www.routledge.com/books/details/9780415346795/.</ref>\n\nAt the popular level in the PRC, it was not easy to allay concerns.  Student-led demonstrations against Japan (cf. [[Anti-Japanese sentiment in China]]), on the one hand, helped reinforce Chinese officials' warnings to their Japanese counterparts.  On the other hand, it was more difficult to change popular opinion in the PRC than it was to change the opinions of the Chinese officials.\n\nMeanwhile, the removal of the General Secretary of the CPC, [[Hu Yaobang]], in 1987 was detrimental to smooth Sino-Japanese relations because Hu had built personal relationships with Nakasone and other Japanese leaders. The PRC government's harsh crackdown on pro-[[democracy]] demonstrations in the spring of 1989 caused Japanese policymakers to realize that the new situation in the PRC was extremely delicate and required careful handling to avoid Japanese actions that would push the PRC further away from reforms.  [[Beijing]] leaders reportedly judged at first that the industrialized countries would relatively quickly resume normal business with the PRC after a brief period of complaint over the [[Tiananmen Square protests of 1989]].  When that did not happen, the PRC officials made strong suggestions to Japanese officials that they break from most industrialized nations by pursuing normal economic intercourse with the PRC, consistent with [[Tokyo]]'s long-term interests in mainland China.  Japanese leaders like West European and U.S. leaders were careful not to isolate the PRC and continued trade and other relations generally consistent with the policies of other industrialized democracies.  But they also followed the [[United States]] lead in limiting economic relations to the PRC.\n\n===1990s===\n[[File:HiroshimaChengduCenter000.jpg|thumb|The Hiroshima-Sichuan Sino-Japanese Friendship Convention Center (Japanese: \u5e83\u5cf6\u30fb\u56db\u5ddd\u4e2d\u65e5\u53cb\u597d\u4f1a\u9928, Simplified Chinese: \u5e7f\u5c9b\u30fb\u56db\u5ddd\u4e2d\u65e5\u53cb\u597d\u4f1a\u9986) in [[Wuhou District]], [[Chengdu]]]]\nBilateral structural change developed during the late 1990s to 2004. Japan had been investing in the PRC during the early 1990s, and trade decreased during the late 1990s, but resurged at the millennium. The resurgence might have been because of the prospect of the PRC becoming a part of the [[World Trade Organization]] (WTO).\n\n===2000s===\nBy 2001 China's international trade was the sixth-largest in the world; and over the next several years it was expected to be just under Japan, the fourth largest.\n\nIn early 2005, Japan and the [[United States]] had issued a joint statement which addresses [[political status of Taiwan|issues concerning the Taiwan Strait]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mofa.go.jp/region/n-america/us/security/scc/joint0502.html |title=Joint Statement U.S.-Japan Security Consultative Committee |publisher=MOFA |date=2005-02-19 |accessdate=2010-10-04}}</ref> The PRC was angered by the statement, and protested the interference in its internal affairs.<ref>an argument China uses often to support their nationalistic aims</ref> The [[Anti-Secession Law]] was passed by the third conference of the 10th [[National People's Congress]] of the PRC, and was ratified in March 2005, and then the law went into effect immediately. Subsequently, [[2005 anti-Japanese demonstrations|anti-Japanese demonstrations]] took place simultaneously in the PRC and other Asian countries.\n\nHowever, the \"warm\" relationship between the PRC and Japan had been revived by two Japanese Prime Ministers, [[Shinzo Abe]] and particularly [[Yasuo Fukuda]] whose father achieved to conclude the [[Treaty of Peace and Friendship between Japan and the People's Republic of China]]. In May 2008, [[Hu Jintao]] was the first [[paramount leader]] of China in over a decade to be invited to Japan on an official visit, and called for increased \"co-operation\" between the two countries. A \"forth\" joint statement<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mofa.go.jp/region/asia-paci/china/joint0805.html |title=Joint Statement between the Government of Japan and the Government of the People's Republic of China on Comprehensive Promotion of a \"Mutually Beneficial Relationship Based on Common Strategic Interests\" (May 7, 2008) |publisher=MOFA |accessdate=2010-10-04}}</ref> by President Hu and Japanese Prime Minister Yasuo Fukuda read:\n\n<blockquote>\n\"The two sides resolved to face history squarely, advance toward the future, and endeavor with persistence to create a new era of a \"mutually beneficial relationship based on common strategic interests\" between Japan and China.

As a matter of fact, Japan was quite reluctant to witness China\u2019s incredible economic growth and therefore had increased its vigilance towards China by viewing China as its biggest threat under Prime Minister Abe\u2019s leadership currently. <ref>{{cite web |url=https://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20100816/ap_on_bi_ge/as_japan_economy;_ylt=As4hhu.nH4lmeEzte4h.aJxY_aF4;_ylu=X3oDMTM1c2tpc3R0BGFzc2V0A2FwLzIwMTAwODE2L2FzX2phcGFuX2Vjb25vbXkEY2NvZGUDbW9zdHBvcHVsYXIEY3BvcwM3BHBvcwM3BHNlYwN5bl90b3Bfc3RvcmllcwRzbGsDY2hpbmFvdmVydGFr |title=China surges past Japan as No. 2 economy; US next? |publisher=News.yahoo.com |accessdate=2010-10-04 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100824195655/http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20100816/ap_on_bi_ge/as_japan_economy |archive-date=2010-08-24 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nChinese animosity or even hatred of Japan is reflected in the popular culture. American reporter Howard French states in 2017:\n:to turn on the television in China is to be inundated with war-themed movies, which overwhelmingly focus on Japanese villainy.  More than 200 anti-Japanese films were produced in 2012 alone, with one scholar calculating that 70% of Chinese TV dramas involved  Japan-related  war plots....A prominent Chinese foreign-policy thinker who has had extensive contact with the country's leadership told me, \"in meetings since Xi has been in power [2012] you could feel the hatred.  Everything is about punishing  Japan.  Punishing this damned [Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo] Abe.\" The most high-profile action that hurt the bilateral relations would be Japanese Prime Ministers\u2019 visits to Yasukuni Shrine, a place considered by most Chinese nationals as offensive because many WWII Japanese military criminals are worshipped there. China-Japan relations reached to the lowest point since the previous Prime Minister Koizumi\u2019s term because of his visit to the shrine. Nonetheless, Prime Minister Abe Shinzo also visited Yasukuni Shrine many times after he got re-elected in 2010, which triggered furious anti-Japanese protests in China due to the negative attitudes and perceptions between the two nations. In a sense, both Koizumi and Abe made \u201cmaverick behavior\u201d, in specific making visits to the Yasukuni Shrine as the proof to exhibit nationalism ideology, which endangered the China-Japan relations into the worst phase.\n<ref>{{cite book|author=Howard W.

They claimed that the rise of [[militarism]] became evident in Japanese politics. Much [[anti-Japanese sentiment]] has raised, and this has been exacerbated by burgeoning feelings of [[Chinese nationalism]] and former Prime Minister [[Junichiro Koizumi]]'s visits to the [[Yasukuni Shrine]].<ref>A [[Jinja (Shinto)|Shinto shrine]] that offers prayers for the war dead including 14 Class A [[war crime|war criminals]]</ref> Although Koizumi openly declared\u2013 in a statement made on April 22, 2005 in [[Jakarta]]\u2013 \"deep remorse\" over [[Japan]]'s wartime crimes (the latest in a series of apologies spanning several decades), many Chinese observers regard the apology as insufficient and not backed up by sincere action.<ref>with more than 80 Parliament members and a Cabinet minister making a pilgrimage to the [[Yasukuni Shrine]] just hours earlier{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}</ref>\n\nThere also remains the dispute over the [[Senkaku Islands]] (Diaoyu Islands), which resulted in clashes between Taiwanese (Chinese) protesters and the Japanese government in April 2005.

The PRC claims that at least 300,000 civilians were murdered while Japan claims a far less figure of 40,000-200,000.  While a majority of Japanese believe in the existence of the massacre, a [[Cinema of Japan|Japanese]]-produced [[documentary film]] released just prior to the 60th anniversary of the massacre, titled ''[[The Truth about Nanjing]]'', denies that any such atrocities took place. These disputes have stirred up enmity against Japan from the global Chinese community, including [[Taiwan]].\n\n====Japan's compensation====\nFrom late 19th century to early 20th century, one of the many factors contributing to the bankruptcy of the Qing government was Japan's requirement for large amount of war reparations. China paid huge amounts of silver to Japan under various treaties, including the [[Sino-Japanese Friendship and Trade Treaty]] (1871), [[Treaty of Shimonoseki]] (1895), the [[Triple Intervention]] (1895) and the [[Boxer Protocol]] (1901).  After the [[First Sino-Japanese War]] in 1894\u201395, the Qing government paid a total of 200,000,000 taels of silver to Japan for reparations.<ref>{{cite book|author=Zhiguo Kong|title=The Making of a Maritime Power: China's Challenges and Policy Responses|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yhRVDQAAQBAJ&pg=PA5|year=2016|publisher=Springer|page=5|isbn=9789811017865}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Second Sino-Japanese War]] 1936-1945 also caused huge economic losses to China.  However, [[Chiang Kai-shek]] waived reparations claims for the [[Second Sino-Japanese War|war]] when the ROC concluded the [[Treaty of Taipei]] with Japan in 1952. Similarly, when Japan normalized its relations with the [[People's Republic of China|PRC]] in 1972, [[Mao Zedong]] waived the claim of war reparations from Japan.<ref>See the Article 5 of [[Joint Communiqu\u00e9 of the Government of Japan and the Government of the People's Republic of China]] in 1972.</ref>\n\nEx-[[Japanese Prime Minister]] [[Hatoyama Yukio]] offered personal apology for Japan's wartime crimes, especially the [[Nanking Massacre]], \"As a Japanese citizen, I feel that it's my duty to apologise for even just one Chinese civilian killed brutally by Japanese soldiers and that such action cannot be excused by saying that it occurred during war.\"<ref>[http://www.scmp.com/news/china/article/1355427/former-japanese-pm-yukio-hatoyama-apologises-atrocities-china Former Japanese PM Yukio Hatoyama apologises for atrocities in China]</ref>\n\n===Issue of Taiwan===\n{{Main|Political status of Taiwan}}\nThe Japan\u2013Taiwan official split is one of the fundamental principles of Sino-Japanese relations. The PRC emphasises [[Taiwan]] is a part of China and the PRC is the only legal government of China (cf. [[One-China policy]]). By the [[Joint Communiqu\u00e9 of the Government of Japan and the Government of the People's Republic of China|1972 agreement]], the [[Treaty of Taipei]] was argued to be invalid.\n\nWhen the PRC\u2013Japan normalization was concerned, the PRC had been worried about some Japanese pro-[[Taiwan independence]] politicians. At the same time, the [[Treaty of Mutual Cooperation and Security between the United States and Japan]] (1960\u2013 ) has been a big problem for the PRC. In a point of the PRC's view, the military alliance treaty implicitly directs to the [[Taiwan Strait]]. It has become a big factor for Taiwan security affairs.\n\n===Human rights===\nIn July 2019, the UN ambassadors from 22 nations, including Japan, signed a joint letter to the [[United Nations Human Rights Council|UNHRC]] condemning China\u2019s mistreatment of the [[Uyghurs]] as well as of other minority groups, urging the Chinese government to close the [[Xinjiang re-education camps]].<ref>{{cite news |title=Which Countries Are For or Against China's Xinjiang Policies? |url=https://thediplomat.com/2019/07/which-countries-are-for-or-against-chinas-xinjiang-policies/ |work=[[The Diplomat]] |date=15 July 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=More than 20 ambassadors condemn China's treatment of Uighurs in Xinjiang |url=https://amp.theguardian.com/world/2019/jul/11/more-than-20-ambassadors-condemn-chinas-treatment-of-uighurs-in-xinjiang |work=The Guardian|date=11 July 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Public perception of relations==\n{{As of|2017}}, about 64.2% of Chinese citizens think that the status of the bilateral relationship is bad, compared to 44.9%, the percentage of Japanese citizens who hold the same view.

The perception of the future of these ties has also gotten better, with 29.7% and 23.6% of Chinese and Japanese citizens, again respectively, expecting relations to worsen, and 28.7% and 13.1% predicting that the relations will get better. The improving view of the status of China\u2013Japan relations has been attributed to more communication between political leaders, a lack of \"big issues\", and the overshadowing of problems in the relationship by problems with North Korea.<ref name=\"jtviewsimproved\">{{cite news| title = Japanese and Chinese views on recent ties have greatly improved, poll shows| newspaper = The Japan Times| date = 14 December 2017| url = https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2017/12/14/national/politics-diplomacy/japanese-chinese-views-recent-ties-greatly-improved-poll-shows/}}</ref> Survey published in 2019 by the [[Pew Research Center]] found that 85% of Japanese had an unfavourable view of China.<ref>{{cite news |title=Public opinion on China turns negative in Western Europe and Asia-Pacific, survey finds |url=https://www.scmp.com/news/china/diplomacy/article/3031142/public-opinion-china-turns-negative-western-europe-and-asia |work=South China Morning Post |date=2 October 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=People around the globe are divided in their opinions of China |url=https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2019/09/30/people-around-the-globe-are-divided-in-their-opinions-of-china/ |work=Pew Research Center |date=30 September 2019}}</ref>\n\n==VIP Inter-visits==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ From Japan to China\n!
