His older brother [[Chuck McGill|Chuck]] ([[Michael McKean]]) became a successful lawyer as one of the partners at an Albuquerque law firm, Hamlin, Hamlin & McGill (HHM). As a child, Jimmy worked at his father Charles Sr.'s ([[Raphael Sbarge]]) general store in Cicero, and watched as con artists regularly scammed his weak, na\u00efve father; Jimmy soon began stealing from the store himself. Determined not to be like his father, Jimmy became a con artist himself, and earned the nickname \"Slippin' Jimmy\" for staging \"[[slip and fall]]\" accidents to make quick cash. He also ran petty scams on drunk strangers with the help of his partner-in-crime Marco Pasternak ([[Mel Rodriguez]]). He eventually [[embezzlement|embezzled]] $14,000 from his family's store, leading to his father declaring bankruptcy. His father died six months later; Jimmy cried inconsolably at the funeral.\n\nJimmy ran into trouble with the Chicago police when he drunkenly defecated through the sunroof of an adversary's car while the man's children were in the car. Facing the possibility of having to register as a sex offender, Jimmy asked Chuck for help. Chuck successfully defended him, but required that he move to Albuquerque and work a legitimate job in HHM's mail room. Some years later, near the time of his divorce, Chuck developed symptoms of [[electromagnetic hypersensitivity]], was unable to work at HHM's offices and became housebound while living without using electricity. Jimmy became his caregiver, bringing him groceries and running his errands.\n\nWhile working in the HHM mail room, Jimmy befriended [[Kim Wexler]] ([[Rhea Seehorn]]), an HHM employee who was attending law school. Inspired by her success, Jimmy completed his college degree and attended a correspondence law school. He passed the [[bar exam]] and hoped to be hired at HHM, but at Chuck's secret instigation, senior partner [[Howard Hamlin]] ([[Patrick Fabian]]) denied Jimmy the opportunity. Jimmy then started a solo practice out of the utility room of a Vietnamese nail salon, which he still operates at the start of ''Better Call Saul''. He takes whatever cases he can get, including low paid public defender work. Jimmy frequently gets into altercations with the stoic [[Mike Ehrmantraut]] ([[Jonathan Banks]]), a former police officer working as an attendant at the courthouse's parking lot. Jimmy still struggles with finances, and, at the start of the show, drives a signature [[Suzuki Esteem]] with mismatched doors, a visual pun reflecting on Jimmy's current poor self-esteem at this stage of his life.<ref name=\"esquire car\">{{cite web | url = https://www.esquire.com/entertainment/tv/a32707/suzuki-esteem-better-call-saul-premiere/ | title = Meet the Suzuki Esteem, the Sad-Sack, Scene-Stealing Car From Better Call Saul | first = Kenny | last =Herzog | date = February 8, 2015 | accessdate = April 8, 2020 | work = [[Esquire (magazine)|Esquire]] }}</ref> At some point prior to the start of the show, Jimmy had been married and divorced twice.\n\nJimmy begins to use the alias \"Saul Goodman\", a play on the phrase \"It's all good, man\". He initially uses it as the alternate identity for the high-energy pitchman in TV ads he produces during the suspension of his law license,<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://variety.com/2017/scene/vpage/better-call-saul-season-3-premiere-breaking-bad-1202018973/|title=\u2018Better Call Saul\u2019 Season 3 Premiere: Jimmy McGill Gets Closer to \u2018Breaking Bad\u2019|last=Gordon|first=Diane|date=March 29, 2017|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|access-date=June 12, 2017|language=en-US}}</ref> and later makes use of it when he begins a business reselling prepaid cell phones on the street. \n\n=== ''Better Call Saul'' ===\n==== Season 1 ====\n{{See also|Better Call Saul (season 1)}}\nUnhappy with working as a public defender for low pay, Jimmy attempts to represent Craig ([[Jeremy Shamos]]) and Betsy Kettleman ([[Julie Ann Emery]]), a couple accused of [[embezzling]] over a million dollars. They hire HHM to represent them and Jimmy attempts to persuade them to switch, leading to an altercation with Tuco Salamanca ([[Raymond Cruz]]) and [[Nacho Varga]] ([[Michael Mando]]), Tuco's subordinate in the Salamanca drug cartel. When Nacho plans to rob them, Jimmy anonymously warns the Kettlemans, and their home later appears to have been the scene of a kidnapping. Nacho, who had been seen surveilling the Kettlemans, is arrested, and Jimmy defends him and obtains his release.\n\nFollowing Mike's hunch, Jimmy discovers the Kettlemans staged their disappearance and are hiding near their home.  When he confronts them, the Kettlemans pay him to keep silent. When HHM suggests the Kettlemans take a plea bargain, they use their payment to Jimmy to blackmail him into defending them.  Jimmy works with Mike to find the Kettlemans' hiding place.  Mike steals their money and delivers it to the district attorney, forcing the Kettlemans to accept a guilty plea for Craig so that both Kettlemans will not go to prison and leave their children alone.\n\nJimmy produces wills for several elderly clients and seems to have great rapport with them, so Kim suggests he focus on an elder law practice. During a visit to the Sandpiper Crossing retirement home, he finds the company is committing fraud by overcharging clients.  With Chuck's help, he finds a document that proves the fraud, and Jimmy and Chuck begin a [[class action lawsuit]] against Sandpiper. When the case grows, Chuck suggests turning it over to HHM, but secretly arranges with Howard to cut Jimmy out of the subsequent litigation.\n\nJimmy confronts Chuck, who admits that he resents Jimmy's legal career and does not consider him a peer because of his unconventional education and conman past.  Jimmy returns to Cicero and spends a week running cons with Marco, but decides to leave after Marco dies of a heart attack. He returns to Albuquerque when Kim calls to say that the case has continued to grow, so HHM has brought in another firm, Davis & Main. Knowing he understands the details of the case better than anyone and has developed personal relationships with the clients, Kim persuades Davis & Main to hire Jimmy as an associate. Jimmy goes home and is prepared to meet with the Davis & Main partners, but has second thoughts and drives away.\n\n==== Season 2 ====\n{{See also|Better Call Saul (season 2)}}\nJimmy hides out at a hotel while vacationing under an assumed name with a stolen credit card.  Kim persuades Jimmy to reconsider joining Davis & Main, so he accepts their offer.  Assigned to enroll new clients in the Sandpiper case, Jimmy succeeds at signing up more residents, but his skirting of the ethical canons leads Chuck to chastise him in front of the other attorneys.  Jimmy produces and airs a television ad without the approval of the D&M partners or the knowledge of the partners at HHM, leading to a reprimand and a junior attorney assigned to constantly supervise him.\n\nKim is relegated to menial document review work as the result of her failure to inform HHM about Jimmy's commercial.  In an effort to reclaim her status at HHM, Kim works her contacts to bring in a new client and succeeds at landing Mesa Verde Bank.  Howard is happy to have the business, but denies Kim credit.  Jimmy proposes that they go into partnership together.  Kim counters with a proposal that they start separate practices in a shared office, so Jimmy quits D&M and Kim quits HHM and they begin their new firms.  Kim succeeds at winning Mesa Verde as a client, but Chuck persuades Mesa Verde to remain with HHM.\n\nChuck's attempts to hide his electromagnetic sensitivity during the meeting with Mesa Verde causes him to become severely ill, and his caregiver Ernesto ([[Brandon K. Hampton]]) calls Jimmy for help.  While Chuck sleeps, Jimmy alters Mesa Verde documents stored at Chuck's house.  As a result, Chuck's application to the state banking board for a new Mesa Verde branch is incorrect, leading to a significant delay.  Mesa Verde fires HHM and hires Kim, and Chuck suspects that Jimmy sabotaged him.  Kim infers Jimmy's guilt and tells him that if he left any evidence, Chuck will find it.\n\nKnowing the copy store clerk where he altered the documents can identify him, Jimmy goes to the store to buy his silence, but sees Ernesto questioning the clerk.  Having visited stores at Chuck's request until he found the right one, Ernesto leaves to pick up Chuck and bring him back to question the clerk.  Jimmy enters the store and bribes the clerk, then waits across the street to see what happens when Chuck arrives.  Chuck begins to question the clerk, but his EHS causes him to faint and hit his head.  Jimmy is torn between coming to Chuck's aid and keeping secret his alteration of the Mesa Verde documents.  Jimmy comes to Chuck's aid and Chuck is transported to the hospital.  He wonders how Jimmy arrived at the store so quickly after his accident and guesses that Jimmy bribed the clerk and stayed nearby to watch.\n\nErnesto lies to Chuck, saying he called Jimmy before bringing Chuck to the store out of concern for Chuck's health.  Chuck's doctor proves to Jimmy that Chuck's EHS symptoms are [[psychosomatic]].  Chuck tricks Jimmy into confessing to the Mesa Verde fraud, which Chuck secretly records.\n\n==== Season 3 ====\n{{See also|Better Call Saul (season 3)}}\n\nChuck arranges for Jimmy to learn of the recording through Ernesto and Kim, and Jimmy breaks into Chuck's house to destroy it.  Chuck's private investigator and Howard witness Jimmy actions, enabling Chuck to report him to the police.\n\nJimmy is arrested, but Chuck tells the prosecutor he prefers having Jimmy submit to a bar association disciplinary hearing to pursuing a criminal case.  Jimmy and Kim make Chuck's mental fitness an issue when he testifies, and Jimmy questions him about his EHS.  Jimmy reveals that Huell Babineaux, a pickpocket, placed Jimmy's cell phone battery in Chuck's pocket and Chuck carried it for over an hour without experiencing symptoms.  The prosecutor says Chuck's mental fitness is not an issue, and the suggestion that Chuck's illness is not real causes him to vent all his frustrations about Jimmy in a tirade that stuns the hearing room audience.  Jimmy's law license is suspended for a year, but he is not disbarred.\n\nTo both pay his share of the rent on the office and make use of TV ad time for which he has already prepaid, Jimmy begins producing commercials for other businesses while using the on air alias Saul Goodman.  He learns of a proposed settlement of the Sandpiper case, of which his share will be more than a million dollars, but finds that Irene, the lawsuit's class representative, has turned it down because the lawyers have advised her that they can obtain a bigger settlement by waiting.\n\nJimmy executes several actions designed to trick Irene into accepting the settlement, but feels remorse when her friends ostracize her.  When he attempts to confess, her friends believe he is covering for her, so he arranges for them to overhear him bragging about tricking them on a hot mike, vindicating Irene and restoring her friendships, but costing him his share of the proposed settlement.  Kim takes on a second client in order to generate the income necessary to keep the office, but falls asleep at the wheel while driving to a meeting and breaks her arm.  Jimmy and Kim close the office and Kim runs her practice from her apartment.\n\nJimmy attempts to obtain a refund of his malpractice insurance premium but finds that the insurance must stay in force in case he is sued over past cases while his license is suspended.  Jimmy pretends to break down while informing the insurance carrier about Chuck's condition, a calculated act to get the carrier to raise Chuck's malpractice insurance. The insurance carrier informs Chuck and Howard that their insurance rates will rise dramatically unless Chuck is continually supervised by another attorney.\n\nChuck wants to fight, but Howard pays the first of three installments that will enable him to buy out Chuck's partnership, and Chuck is forced to retire.  Jimmy attempts to make amends with Chuck, but Chuck rebuffs him.  Chuck's EHS symptoms become more severe and he removes all the appliances from his house and pulls out the wiring in an effort to discover what is causing his electricity meter to keep running.  Chuck's condition continues to deteriorate, and he purposely kicks over a gas lantern that sets his house ablaze.\n\n==== Season 4 ====\n{{See also|Better Call Saul (season 4)}}\nJimmy believes himself at fault for Chuck's death until Howard confides his belief that he is at fault because of his response to the increase in malpractice insurance rates.  Jimmy conceals his role in the insurance issue, allows Howard to accept the blame, and regains his upbeat demeanor.\n\nWhile job hunting, Jimmy spots an opportunity to steal a valuable [[Hummel figurine]] from the owner of a copier store, which he hires Ira to do.  While managing a cell phone store, Jimmy uses his token inheritance from Chuck to begin a lucrative side business reselling prepaid phones on the street, again making use of the Saul Goodman alias.  Kim is bored with practicing banking law for Mesa Verde, and begins accepting ''pro bono'' criminal defense cases she finds more satisfying.  Kim persuades Schweikart & Cokely, the firm representing Sandpiper, to hire her as a partner in charge of a new banking division, but tells Jimmy that senior partner Rich Schweikart sought her out.\n\nJimmy's side business comes crashing down when a plainclothes cop shows up to question him. Huell, acting as Jimmy's bodyguard, misunderstands the interaction due to wearing headphones, and strikes the cop over the head with a bag of sandwiches, leading to an assault charge. As the cop has previously interacted with Huell, he plays up his injuries, and the assistant district attorney seeks to subject Huell to a sentence of several years in prison as a repeat offender. Jimmy enlists Kim's aid to defend Huell, but she refuses to ruin the cop's reputation.  Instead, Kim and Jimmy arrange for a false show of support for Huell that results in the prosecutor accepting a plea bargain that keeps him out of prison. With Kim elated by the thrill of the scam, she convinces Jimmy to help her run a con that enables her to replace approved plans for a Mesa Verde branch in Lubbock, Texas with plans for a bigger building.\n\nJimmy's request for reinstatement is denied, and he learns it was because he failed to show remorse for Chuck's death.  To prepare for his appeal, Kim and Jimmy carry out several public displays that enable him to fake remorse, including dedicating a law library reading room in Chuck's name at the [[University of New Mexico]]. Jimmy makes a speech to the appeal panel about wanting to do justice to the McGill name, convincing them to reinstate his license. He then shocks Kim by obtaining a [[doing business as|DBA]] application, revealing that the speech was an insincere con, and that he intends to resume practicing law under the name Saul Goodman.\n\n==== Season 5 ====\n{{See also|Better Call Saul (season 5)}}\nJimmy's law license is reinstated and he tells Kim he realized that continuing to use the \"Saul Goodman\" alias from his prepaid cell phone business gives him an instant client base for a new criminal law practice. His relationship with Kim is strained when he encourages her to use a con to convince one of her ''pro bono'' clients to accept a favorable plea bargain. After refusing Jimmy's offer, Kim runs the con herself, but later tells Jimmy she does not want to lie to succeed, and he agrees not to engage in ethically questionable activities when her clients are involved. Nacho brings Jimmy to Lalo when Domingo is arrested, and they work out a plan to free Domingo by giving information about Gus's dead drops to give to Hank and Steve at the DEA and pretending that Domingo is willing to become Hank's confidential informant. Lalo is pleased with the result, and Jimmy realizes he will have to continue working for the Salamancas, because as Nacho tells him \"Once you're in, you're in.\" Jimmy meets Howard for lunch, where Howard apologizes for the firm's past treatment of Jimmy and offers him a position at HHM. Jimmy continues to be unnerved by Howard's reminders of his past and uses three bowling balls to damage Howard's car. After representing two prostitutes in court, Jimmy pays them to loudly disrupt Howard's lunch with Clifford Main.\n\nEverett Acker lives on land owned by Mesa Verde bank, which wants him to move so the bank can construct a new [[call center]]. Kim is sympathetic to Acker and Kevin refuses to compromise, so Kim asks Jimmy as Saul to represent Acker against the bank. Jimmy engages in several tactics the delay construction, but Kevin still refuses to compromise, so Kim resigns herself to Acker's eviction. Jimmy suggests they could search for \"dirt\" on Kevin and blackmail him into a compromise, but also advises against it. Kim decides to proceed, so Jimmy hires Sobchak to surveil Kevin and search his house. Kim sees something in Sobchak's photos of Kevin's house that can be used against Kevin. Rich suggests that Kim remove herself from Mesa Verde business, correctly deducing that her heart is not in it, but she angrily refuses.\n\nKim later tells Jimmy she does not want to proceed with blackmailing Kevin and offers Acker $75,000 to settle, promising to personally make up the difference between that figure and the amount Kevin agrees to pay. Jimmy agrees but at the meeting to finalize the deal, he stuns everyone by demanding $4 million. Kim's insight into Sobchak's photos is that Mesa Verde's logo is based on a photograph the bank does not have permission to use. Kevin ridicules Jimmy' demand, and Jimmy pressures him with threats of an injunction against using the logo and TV ads soliciting potential clients for class action lawsuits against the bank which show Kevin's father Don in an unfavorable light. Kevin meets with Jimmy privately and agrees to a settlement that includes payments to both Acker and the photographer. Kim returns home and an apprehensive Jimmy suggests they have cause to celebrate, but Kim is furious and vents her anger at Jimmy for making her the \"sucker\" in his con.  Kim suggests to Jimmy that they separate, but then proposes marriage. They marry the next day, attaching [[spousal privilege]] to their conversations, which means Jimmy will not have to lie to Kim about his activities. \n\nWhen Lalo is charged with the murder of Fred the money wire clerk, Lalo asks Jimmy to obtain his release on bail so that he does not go to trial, and promises Jimmy will become wealthy as a \"friend of the cartel\" if he succeeds. Gus also desires Lalo's release, so Mike provide Jimmy details on the investigative work he did under an assumed name to have Lalo arrested. Jimmy uses the information to accuse police of witness tampering, and the judge grants bail but sets it at $7 million cash. Lalo stuns Jimmy by saying he can afford to pay it, but says Jimmy will have to pick up the money for him. Howard sees Jimmy at the courthouse and asks if he has decided whether to accept his offer to join HHM. Jimmy says he is still considering it, but Howard realizes Jimmy is toying with him. Howard confronts Jimmy over his recent harassment of Howard, and Jimmy angrily blames Howard for Chuck's death and says Jimmy/Saul has grown too big for the constraints of a job at HHM.\n\nLalo requests that Jimmy transport the cash for his bail. Jimmy is reluctant, but agrees after Lalo accepts his request of a $100,000 fee. Kim is unable to persuade Jimmy not to go, so he drives to a remote desert site. The Cousins deliver two bags of cash, then immediately depart. Jimmy is ambushed by several gunmen. They take the cash and are about to kill him when they are attacked. The unseen shooter is Mike, who tracked Jimmy at Gus's behest. He kills all but one gunman, who escapes in the only truck that is still drivable. Mike and Jimmy put the cash back in Jimmy's car and begin the trip back to Albuquerque. When the car breaks down, they push it over the edge of the road and begin to walk cross-country to avoid the surviving gunman. They camp out overnight, and Jimmy reveals to Mike that Kim knows some details of his activities. Mike warns Jimmy that if Kim knows about the Salamancas, she is now \"in the game\". They resume their trek the next day, and an exhausted, dehydrated, and sunburned Jimmy gives up. Mike spots the surviving gunman and intends to hide and wait. Instead, Jimmy runs to the edge of the road to attract his attention and draw him in. When the gunman is close enough, Mike shoots him. The gunman's truck flips and is destroyed. Mike and Jimmy resume their walk, now on the road.\n\nJimmy and Mike make their way to a truck stop, where Tyrus and Victor pick them up. They agree on a cover story for Jimmy to tell Lalo. Jimmy posts Lalo's bail and Lalo is released. Jimmy tells Lalo he was alone and his car broke down, so he walked to avoid putting the money at risk. Lalo says he plans to return to Mexico to avoid the scrutiny of suspicious police and prosecutors. Jimmy tells Kim the same story, but she realizes he is lying and tells him she will be ready to listen when he is ready to talk. Jimmy tells Mike he is experiencing [[posttraumatic stress disorder|posttraumatic stress]]. Mike tells Jimmy it will pass with time. Nacho brings Lalo to the same pickup point where Jimmy received the money. Instead of waiting for The Cousins, he searches for Jimmy's car. After he finds it, he tells Nacho to drive back to Albuquerque. Mike calls to warn Jimmy just before Lalo arrives at Kim and Jimmy's apartment. As Mike trains a sniper rifle on Lalo from a nearby roof, Lalo has Jimmy repeat the story of his desert trek, then reveals he found bullet holes in Jimmy's car. Kim argues that passersby probably shot at the car for fun and berates Lalo for not trusting Jimmy. Lalo seems satisfied and departs. He tells Nacho they are going to Mexico, but not to the original pickup site.\n\nJimmy and Kim watch Lalo leave. Jimmy asks Mike why Mike has been protecting him, but Mike hangs up. Jimmy tells Kim the truth about his desert trek with Mike. They check into a hotel after agreeing that it is not safe to stay at their apartment. The next day, Jimmy tries to convince Kim to stay in, but Kim goes to the courthouse. She meets with the public defender and agrees to accept 20 pending felony cases ''pro bono''. Kim tells Howard she quit Schweikart and Cokely and Howard tells Kim about Jimmy's recent harassment campaign. Howard blames Jimmy and says Kim should stop following his lead. Kim laughs at Howard and says she is insulted by the idea that she cannot decide for herself. Jimmy confronts Mike at his home and demands to know why Mike has been aiding him. Mike tells Jimmy that Lalo will be killed that night, and Jimmy tells Kim. Kim suggests sabotaging Howard to force a resolution of the Sandpiper case, which would enable Jimmy to obtain his seven-figure share of the expected settlement. Jimmy counsels against it as a [[scorched earth]] tactic but Kim uses the same finger-pointing gesture Jimmy previously used to show that she is serious about undermining Howard.{{efn|This is a reversal of the roles from the final scene of the fourth season finale episode \"[[Winner (Better Call Saul)|Winner]]\", when Jimmy reveals to Kim he plans to practice law under the name \"Saul Goodman\" and gives her the same gesture as he walks off.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/tv/tv-recaps/better-call-saul-season-5-finale-recap-something-unforgivable-984335/ |title=\u2018Better Call Saul\u2019 Season 5 Finale Recap: Survival Skills |last=Sepinwall |first=Alan |authorlink=Alan Sepinwall |date=April 20, 2020 |website=[[Rolling Stone]] |access-date=April 20, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=https://ew.com/tv/better-call-saul-season-5-finale-bob-odenkirk-rhea-seehorn/ |title=Better Call Saul finale: Bob Odenkirk and Rhea Seehorn break down Kim's shocking pitch to Jimmy |last=Snierson |first=Dan |date=April 20, 2020 |website=[[Entertainment Weekly]] |access-date=April 20, 2020}}</ref>}}\n\n=== ''Breaking Bad'' ===\n[[File:Bob Odenkirk and Emily Rios 2011 at Breaking Bad set.jpg|thumb|Bob Odenkirk as Saul Goodman on the set of ''Breaking Bad'' during the filming of the fourth season, with [[Emily Rios]] ([[Andrea Cantillo]])]]\nBy the time of Saul's introduction in ''Breaking Bad'', he has fully adopted the name \"Saul Goodman\", and rarely mentions the name McGill.

Saul has already offered to be Badger's legal counsel and has learned that the DEA hopes Badger will lead them to \"Heisenberg\". Walt poses as Badger's uncle and goes to Saul's office, where he learns that Saul will advise Badger to reveal his associates in order to avoid prison. Walt offers Saul a bribe to keep Badger from \"flipping\", but Saul refuses.\n\nWalt and Jesse kidnap Saul and threaten to kill him if he does not keep Badger from informing. Saul, initially worried that the two are from Lalo or Nacho, sees through their scare tactics, takes a token payment so he can give them legal advice protected by attorney-client privilege, and tells them about Jimmy \"In-'N-Out\" Kilkelly (Jimmy Daniels), who makes a living confessing to the crimes of others and going to prison.  Saul arranges for Kilkelly to be arrested and confess to being Heisenberg.  The DEA busts Kilkelly when Badger meets with him for a drug deal, but Hank is not completely convinced. Later, Saul visits Walt at his school.  He informs Walt that he was too easy to find and offers to be his full-time legal counsel, money launderer, and adviser with respect to protecting his identity.\n\nCombo (Rodney Rush), Jesse's friend and one of their dealers, is killed by a rival gang, and Jesse's friends refuse to sell any further. Saul helps Walt and Jesse out by promising to contact another dealer, Gus, though warns the pair that Gus is very selective of whom he does business with. Walter ultimately convinces Gus to buy their latest batch valued at nearly one million dollars, but Gus expresses strong reservations about Jesse's drug addiction and trustworthiness.\n\n==== Season 3 ====\n{{See also|Breaking Bad (season 3)}}\nTo help launder Walt's drug money, Saul uses the website his son Walter Jr. ([[R.J. Mitte]]) set up for donors to contribute to Walt's [[chemotherapy]], making the drug cash look like small donations from numerous contributors. Saul also helps Jesse anonymously buy his aunt's house back from his parents with his share of the drug money. Saul and Mike bug Walt's wife Skyler's ([[Anna Gunn]]) house to find out if she has told anyone about Walt. Saul attempts to get Jesse to convince Walt to resume cooking methamphetamine. After an altercation between Walt and Skyler's boss Ted Beneke ([[Christopher Cousins]]), Mike brings Walt to Saul. Walt figures out that Saul has been bugging his house and attacks him, causing Saul to refuse to launder any more money through Walter Jr.'s website. Jesse visits Saul with methamphetamine he produced and asks for a meeting with Gus, at which Gus agrees to buy Jesse's product, assuming it will be an incentive to Walt.  Saul sets up a meeting between Jesse and Walt to resolve the issue of Jesse's half of the money from their previous work for Gus.  Walt agrees to resume meth production for Gus, with Gale Boetticher ([[David Costabile]]) as his assistant, so Saul changes sides and agrees to launder Walt's new income.\n\nWhen Walt's brother-in-law [[Hank Schrader]] ([[Dean Norris]]), a [[DEA]] agent, is close to catching Jesse in the recreational vehicle Walt and he use as a meth lab, and learning that Walt is with him, Walt calls Saul.  Saul has his secretary Francesca ([[Tina Parker]]) pose as a [[Albuquerque Police Department]] dispatcher falsely claiming that Hank\u2019s wife Marie ([[Betsy Brandt]]) has been in a car accident, luring Hank away to the hospital, thus giving Jesse and Walt enough time to destroy the RV. Nevertheless, Saul feels guilty about his part in the cruel ruse. Frustrated at losing his potential arrest of Jesse, Hank attacks Jesse at his home. Saul visits a hospitalized Jesse, who threatens to expose Walt's identity. Saul and Walt consider killing Jesse, but decide against it.  Saul tries to convince Jesse to buy commercial properties to launder his money but Jesse rejects the idea. Saul discusses plans for money laundering with Skyler and Walt, floating the idea of buying a laser tag business.  Skyler wants to buy Walt's former employer Bogdan's ([[Marius Stan (actor)|Marius Stan]]) car wash, believing it is a much more plausible front business. Walt visits Saul to discuss Jesse's plan to kill two dealers who work for Gus and killed Jesse's friend Combo and his girlfriend Andrea's ([[Emily Rios]]) brother Tom\u00e1s ([[Angelo Martinez]]). Mike threatens Saul in order to obtain Jesse's location, intending to kill him before he acts against the dealers, but Saul sends Mike to the wrong location. Saul helps Jesse hide and later arranges for Jesse and Walt to meet at the laser tag arcade.\n\n==== Season 4 ====\n{{See also|Breaking Bad (season 4)}}\nSaul and Skyler plot ways to persuade Bogdan to sell the car wash, but Skyler rules out violence or intimidation. Saul has his employee Patrick Kuby ([[Bill Burr]]) pose as a government inspector to inform Bogdan of supposed environmental concerns that will cost hundreds of thousands of dollars to mitigate.  Bogdan sells the car wash to Walt and Skyler, and Skyler takes over day-to-day management. Walt confides in Saul about his concerns with respect to Jesse, Hank, and Gus. Saul tells Walt about Ed the \"disappearer\" ([[Robert Forster]]), a vacuum repair shop owner who can provide Walt and his family new identities if they have to flee. Walt runs over Gus' two dealers before Jesse can kill them, then tells Jesse to run. Saul helps ensure the damage to Walt's car is not discovered.  Walt suggests that Gus will retaliate for the murder of the two dealers and recommends that Saul contact a hit man to kill Gus, but Saul dismisses the idea. At Jesse's behest, Saul visits Andrea and tries to give her Jesse's remaining cash.\n\nTo protect Skyler from the IRS investigation into Beneke's tax fraud, Saul gives him $620,000 of Walt's cash to pay the tax bill by passing off the money as an inheritance from a fake relative. Ted plans to spend the cash, so Saul sends Kuby and his other employee Huell Babineaux ([[Lavell Crawford]]) to force him to pay the IRS, and after Beneke signs the check he tries to run away, trips, and injures himself. After Gus threatens Walt, Walt demands Saul set up a meeting with Ed so his family can escape. Walt asks Saul to tip off the DEA about Gus directing his assassins Marcos ([[Daniel Moncada]]) and Leonel Salamanca ([[Luis Moncada]]) to attack Hank. Saul agrees but refuses to mention Gus' name. Saul persuades Jesse to come to his office, and has Huell secretly steal the [[ricin]] cigarette Walt gave Jesse to use in killing Gus. Saul gives Jesse his money and tells him to leave Albuquerque for his own safety. Jesse realizes the ricin is gone. Andrea's son Brock ([[Ian Posada]]) is poisoned and Jesse tells the doctors to check for ricin, believing that Walt is responsible. Walt persuades Jesse that Gus poisoned Brock, however, so Jesse agrees to help him kill Gus. Saul goes into hiding, but returns to represent Jesse when he is questioned about Brock's poisoning. Saul discovers from Jesse that Gus regularly visits Hector Salamanca ([[Mark Margolis]]) in a nursing home.  Saul passes the information to Walt, who uses it in a plot to kill Gus.\n\n==== Season 5 ====\n{{See also|Breaking Bad (season 5)}}\n\n===== Part 1 =====\nSaul tells Skyler about Beneke's accident, which has left him hospitalized and immobile. Walt is angry with Saul about Saul's payment to Beneke, while Saul is upset at Walt for poisoning Brock (as revealed in the previous season's finale episode), revealing that he knew about it all along. He attempts to end his relationship with Walt, but Walt intimidates him into continuing their business arrangement. With Gus dead, Saul tries to convince Walt to stop making meth, but Walt says he has to continue because he needs the cash. Saul hosts a meeting between Mike, Jesse, and Walt, where they agree to set up a new meth-producing business. Saul helps Walt and Jesse look for new locations, and they agree on Ira's business, Vamanos Pest Control, as the best option. Saul defends Mike from the DEA's investigation by threatening litigation over their supposed harassment. The DEA learns that Mike's lawyer Dan Wachsberger ([[Chris Freihofer]]) is the conduit for Mike's hush money payments to Gus's former employees and Mike's hiding cash for his daughter-in-law Stacey ([[Kerry Condon]]) and granddaughter Kaylee (Abigail Zoe Lewis). Mike asks Saul to retrieve the \"go bag\" with cash and false identity documents that he previously hid. Saul is unable, however, and has Walt do it. When Mike refuses to divulge the names of Gus' former employees so Walt can have them killed to protect his identity, Walt shoots and kills him. Jesse tries to have Saul take the $5 million Jesse made stealing a trainload of [[methylamine]] and distribute it to Kaylee and the parents of Drew Sharp, a young boy whom cartel minion Todd Alquist ([[Jesse Plemons]]) killed during the theft. Saul refuses, saying the attempt to move the cash will attract more police scrutiny. Jesse attempts to get rid of the money in other ways, including throwing it onto random lawns and leaving it in random mailboxes. Saul calls Walt to inform him of Jesse's erratic behavior.\n\n===== Part 2 =====\nWalt visits Saul to tell him that Hank has learned that Walt is Heisenberg. Saul suggests killing Hank, but Walt refuses. Jesse is arrested while tossing money from his car, and Saul obtains his release from police custody. Saul arranges a meeting between Walt and Jesse, and Walt convinces Jesse to contact Ed and start a new life. Saul wants Jesse to give up drugs before beginning the trip, but Jesse refuses, so Saul has Huell pickpocket Jesse's cannabis. When Jesse realizes his marijuana was stolen, he figures out that Huell must have also stolen the ricin cigarette, meaning that Walt poisoned Brock and Saul knew. Instead of leaving with Ed, Jesse returns to Saul's office and assaults him. Saul admits he had Huell steal the ricin, but says he did not know what Walt intended. Saul calls Walt to warn him that Jesse knows the truth about what happened to Brock. Saul meets with Walt and suggests killing Jesse. After the DEA manipulates Huell into telling them what happened to Walt's money, Saul is afraid for his life and meets with Walt at the car wash. Believing his arrest is imminent, Walt goes into hiding. Saul and Walt both contact Ed, who sets up a new life for Saul as Gene, the manager of a Cinnabon in [[Omaha, Nebraska]]. Walt tries to persuade Saul to go with him instead of going to Omaha, and to contact hit men to kill his former dealing associate Jack Welker ([[Michael Bowen (actor)|Michael Bowen]]) in retaliation for killing Hank, but Saul refuses. Walt tries to intimidate Saul but doubles over in a coughing fit. Saul leaves Walt in Ed's basement and begins his trip to Omaha.\n\n=== Post-''Breaking Bad'' ===\nThough Saul does not appear in ''[[El Camino: A Breaking Bad Movie]]'', Ed refers to him when Jesse attempts to persuade Ed to help him leave Albuquerque and begin a new life.<ref>{{cite news |last=Harding |first=Amanda |date=October 15, 2019 |title=Did 'El Camino: A Breaking Bad Movie' Just Predict a Tragic Ending for Saul Goodman In 'Better Call Saul'? |url=https://www.cheatsheet.com/entertainment/did-el-camino-a-breaking-bad-movie-just-predict-a-tragic-ending-for-saul-goodman-in-better-call-saul.html/ |work=Showbiz Cheat Sheet}}</ref>  In addition, a scene in the film shows that the strip mall location of Saul's former law office has become a restaurant and sports bar.<ref>{{cite news |date=October 12, 2019 |title=El Camino answers many burning Breaking Bad questions |url=https://www.news.com.au/entertainment/movies/new-movies/el-camino-answers-many-burning-breaking-bad-questions/news-story/f6fb2d768803a3d15ff8d15b5dbe8728 |work=[[News.com.au]] |location=Sydney, Australia}}</ref>\n\nThe season premieres of ''Better Call Saul'' open with black-and-white [[Flashforward|flash forwards]] that take place after ''Breaking Bad'', showing that after leaving Albuquerque, Saul relocates to Omaha, Nebraska under the alias Gene Takavic, keeping a low profile as a manager of a [[Cinnabon]] store.

His older brother [[Chuck McGill|Chuck]] ([[Michael McKean]]) became a successful lawyer as one of the partners at an Albuquerque law firm, Hamlin, Hamlin & McGill (HHM). As a child, Jimmy worked at his father Charles Sr.'s ([[Raphael Sbarge]]) general store in Cicero, and watched as con artists regularly scammed his weak, na\u00efve father; Jimmy soon began stealing from the store himself. Determined not to be like his father, Jimmy became a con artist himself, and earned the nickname \"Slippin' Jimmy\" for staging \"[[slip and fall]]\" accidents to make quick cash. He also ran petty scams on drunk strangers with the help of his partner-in-crime Marco Pasternak ([[Mel Rodriguez]]). He eventually [[embezzlement|embezzled]] $14,000 from his family's store, leading to his father declaring bankruptcy. His father died six months later; Jimmy cried inconsolably at the funeral.\n\nJimmy ran into trouble with the Chicago police when he drunkenly defecated through the sunroof of an adversary's car while the man's children were in the car. Facing the possibility of having to register as a sex offender, Jimmy asked Chuck for help. Chuck successfully defended him, but required that he move to Albuquerque and work a legitimate job in HHM's mail room. Some years later, near the time of his divorce, Chuck developed symptoms of [[electromagnetic hypersensitivity]], was unable to work at HHM's offices and became housebound while living without using electricity. Jimmy became his caregiver, bringing him groceries and running his errands.\n\nWhile working in the HHM mail room, Jimmy befriended [[Kim Wexler]] ([[Rhea Seehorn]]), an HHM employee who was attending law school. Inspired by her success, Jimmy completed his college degree and attended a correspondence law school. He passed the [[bar exam]] and hoped to be hired at HHM, but at Chuck's secret instigation, senior partner [[Howard Hamlin]] ([[Patrick Fabian]]) denied Jimmy the opportunity. Jimmy then started a solo practice out of the utility room of a Vietnamese nail salon, which he still operates at the start of ''Better Call Saul''. He takes whatever cases he can get, including low paid public defender work. Jimmy frequently gets into altercations with the stoic [[Mike Ehrmantraut]] ([[Jonathan Banks]]), a former police officer working as an attendant at the courthouse's parking lot. Jimmy still struggles with finances, and, at the start of the show, drives a signature [[Suzuki Esteem]] with mismatched doors, a visual pun reflecting on Jimmy's current poor self-esteem at this stage of his life.<ref name=\"esquire car\">{{cite web | url = https://www.esquire.com/entertainment/tv/a32707/suzuki-esteem-better-call-saul-premiere/ | title = Meet the Suzuki Esteem, the Sad-Sack, Scene-Stealing Car From Better Call Saul | first = Kenny | last =Herzog | date = February 8, 2015 | accessdate = April 8, 2020 | work = [[Esquire (magazine)|Esquire]] }}</ref> At some point prior to the start of the show, Jimmy had been married and divorced twice.\n\nJimmy begins to use the alias \"Saul Goodman\", a play on the phrase \"It's all good, man\". He initially uses it as the alternate identity for the high-energy pitchman in TV ads he produces during the suspension of his law license,<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://variety.com/2017/scene/vpage/better-call-saul-season-3-premiere-breaking-bad-1202018973/|title=\u2018Better Call Saul\u2019 Season 3 Premiere: Jimmy McGill Gets Closer to \u2018Breaking Bad\u2019|last=Gordon|first=Diane|date=March 29, 2017|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|access-date=June 12, 2017|language=en-US}}</ref> and later makes use of it when he begins a business reselling prepaid cell phones on the street. \n\n=== ''Better Call Saul'' ===\n==== Season 1 ====\n{{See also|Better Call Saul (season 1)}}\nUnhappy with working as a public defender for low pay, Jimmy attempts to represent Craig ([[Jeremy Shamos]]) and Betsy Kettleman ([[Julie Ann Emery]]), a couple accused of [[embezzling]] over a million dollars. They hire HHM to represent them and Jimmy attempts to persuade them to switch, leading to an altercation with Tuco Salamanca ([[Raymond Cruz]]) and [[Nacho Varga]] ([[Michael Mando]]), Tuco's subordinate in the Salamanca drug cartel. When Nacho plans to rob them, Jimmy anonymously warns the Kettlemans, and their home later appears to have been the scene of a kidnapping. Nacho, who had been seen surveilling the Kettlemans, is arrested, and Jimmy defends him and obtains his release.\n\nFollowing Mike's hunch, Jimmy discovers the Kettlemans staged their disappearance and are hiding near their home.  When he confronts them, the Kettlemans pay him to keep silent. When HHM suggests the Kettlemans take a plea bargain, they use their payment to Jimmy to blackmail him into defending them.  Jimmy works with Mike to find the Kettlemans' hiding place.  Mike steals their money and delivers it to the district attorney, forcing the Kettlemans to accept a guilty plea for Craig so that both Kettlemans will not go to prison and leave their children alone.\n\nJimmy produces wills for several elderly clients and seems to have great rapport with them, so Kim suggests he focus on an elder law practice. During a visit to the Sandpiper Crossing retirement home, he finds the company is committing fraud by overcharging clients.  With Chuck's help, he finds a document that proves the fraud, and Jimmy and Chuck begin a [[class action lawsuit]] against Sandpiper. When the case grows, Chuck suggests turning it over to HHM, but secretly arranges with Howard to cut Jimmy out of the subsequent litigation.\n\nJimmy confronts Chuck, who admits that he resents Jimmy's legal career and does not consider him a peer because of his unconventional education and conman past.  Jimmy returns to Cicero and spends a week running cons with Marco, but decides to leave after Marco dies of a heart attack. He returns to Albuquerque when Kim calls to say that the case has continued to grow, so HHM has brought in another firm, Davis & Main. Knowing he understands the details of the case better than anyone and has developed personal relationships with the clients, Kim persuades Davis & Main to hire Jimmy as an associate. Jimmy goes home and is prepared to meet with the Davis & Main partners, but has second thoughts and drives away.\n\n==== Season 2 ====\n{{See also|Better Call Saul (season 2)}}\nJimmy hides out at a hotel while vacationing under an assumed name with a stolen credit card.  Kim persuades Jimmy to reconsider joining Davis & Main, so he accepts their offer.  Assigned to enroll new clients in the Sandpiper case, Jimmy succeeds at signing up more residents, but his skirting of the ethical canons leads Chuck to chastise him in front of the other attorneys.  Jimmy produces and airs a television ad without the approval of the D&M partners or the knowledge of the partners at HHM, leading to a reprimand and a junior attorney assigned to constantly supervise him.\n\nKim is relegated to menial document review work as the result of her failure to inform HHM about Jimmy's commercial.  In an effort to reclaim her status at HHM, Kim works her contacts to bring in a new client and succeeds at landing Mesa Verde Bank.  Howard is happy to have the business, but denies Kim credit.  Jimmy proposes that they go into partnership together.  Kim counters with a proposal that they start separate practices in a shared office, so Jimmy quits D&M and Kim quits HHM and they begin their new firms.  Kim succeeds at winning Mesa Verde as a client, but Chuck persuades Mesa Verde to remain with HHM.\n\nChuck's attempts to hide his electromagnetic sensitivity during the meeting with Mesa Verde causes him to become severely ill, and his caregiver Ernesto ([[Brandon K. Hampton]]) calls Jimmy for help.  While Chuck sleeps, Jimmy alters Mesa Verde documents stored at Chuck's house.  As a result, Chuck's application to the state banking board for a new Mesa Verde branch is incorrect, leading to a significant delay.  Mesa Verde fires HHM and hires Kim, and Chuck suspects that Jimmy sabotaged him.  Kim infers Jimmy's guilt and tells him that if he left any evidence, Chuck will find it.\n\nKnowing the copy store clerk where he altered the documents can identify him, Jimmy goes to the store to buy his silence, but sees Ernesto questioning the clerk.  Having visited stores at Chuck's request until he found the right one, Ernesto leaves to pick up Chuck and bring him back to question the clerk.  Jimmy enters the store and bribes the clerk, then waits across the street to see what happens when Chuck arrives.  Chuck begins to question the clerk, but his EHS causes him to faint and hit his head.  Jimmy is torn between coming to Chuck's aid and keeping secret his alteration of the Mesa Verde documents.  Jimmy comes to Chuck's aid and Chuck is transported to the hospital.  He wonders how Jimmy arrived at the store so quickly after his accident and guesses that Jimmy bribed the clerk and stayed nearby to watch.\n\nErnesto lies to Chuck, saying he called Jimmy before bringing Chuck to the store out of concern for Chuck's health.  Chuck's doctor proves to Jimmy that Chuck's EHS symptoms are [[psychosomatic]].  Chuck tricks Jimmy into confessing to the Mesa Verde fraud, which Chuck secretly records.\n\n==== Season 3 ====\n{{See also|Better Call Saul (season 3)}}\n\nChuck arranges for Jimmy to learn of the recording through Ernesto and Kim, and Jimmy breaks into Chuck's house to destroy it.  Chuck's private investigator and Howard witness Jimmy actions, enabling Chuck to report him to the police.\n\nJimmy is arrested, but Chuck tells the prosecutor he prefers having Jimmy submit to a bar association disciplinary hearing to pursuing a criminal case.  Jimmy and Kim make Chuck's mental fitness an issue when he testifies, and Jimmy questions him about his EHS.  Jimmy reveals that Huell Babineaux, a pickpocket, placed Jimmy's cell phone battery in Chuck's pocket and Chuck carried it for over an hour without experiencing symptoms.  The prosecutor says Chuck's mental fitness is not an issue, and the suggestion that Chuck's illness is not real causes him to vent all his frustrations about Jimmy in a tirade that stuns the hearing room audience.  Jimmy's law license is suspended for a year, but he is not disbarred.\n\nTo both pay his share of the rent on the office and make use of TV ad time for which he has already prepaid, Jimmy begins producing commercials for other businesses while using the on air alias Saul Goodman.  He learns of a proposed settlement of the Sandpiper case, of which his share will be more than a million dollars, but finds that Irene, the lawsuit's class representative, has turned it down because the lawyers have advised her that they can obtain a bigger settlement by waiting.\n\nJimmy executes several actions designed to trick Irene into accepting the settlement, but feels remorse when her friends ostracize her.  When he attempts to confess, her friends believe he is covering for her, so he arranges for them to overhear him bragging about tricking them on a hot mike, vindicating Irene and restoring her friendships, but costing him his share of the proposed settlement.  Kim takes on a second client in order to generate the income necessary to keep the office, but falls asleep at the wheel while driving to a meeting and breaks her arm.  Jimmy and Kim close the office and Kim runs her practice from her apartment.\n\nJimmy attempts to obtain a refund of his malpractice insurance premium but finds that the insurance must stay in force in case he is sued over past cases while his license is suspended.  Jimmy pretends to break down while informing the insurance carrier about Chuck's condition, a calculated act to get the carrier to raise Chuck's malpractice insurance. The insurance carrier informs Chuck and Howard that their insurance rates will rise dramatically unless Chuck is continually supervised by another attorney.\n\nChuck wants to fight, but Howard pays the first of three installments that will enable him to buy out Chuck's partnership, and Chuck is forced to retire.  Jimmy attempts to make amends with Chuck, but Chuck rebuffs him.  Chuck's EHS symptoms become more severe and he removes all the appliances from his house and pulls out the wiring in an effort to discover what is causing his electricity meter to keep running.  Chuck's condition continues to deteriorate, and he purposely kicks over a gas lantern that sets his house ablaze.\n\n==== Season 4 ====\n{{See also|Better Call Saul (season 4)}}\nJimmy believes himself at fault for Chuck's death until Howard confides his belief that he is at fault because of his response to the increase in malpractice insurance rates.  Jimmy conceals his role in the insurance issue, allows Howard to accept the blame, and regains his upbeat demeanor.\n\nWhile job hunting, Jimmy spots an opportunity to steal a valuable [[Hummel figurine]] from the owner of a copier store, which he hires Ira to do.  While managing a cell phone store, Jimmy uses his token inheritance from Chuck to begin a lucrative side business reselling prepaid phones on the street, again making use of the Saul Goodman alias.  Kim is bored with practicing banking law for Mesa Verde, and begins accepting ''pro bono'' criminal defense cases she finds more satisfying.  Kim persuades Schweikart & Cokely, the firm representing Sandpiper, to hire her as a partner in charge of a new banking division, but tells Jimmy that senior partner Rich Schweikart sought her out.\n\nJimmy's side business comes crashing down when a plainclothes cop shows up to question him. Huell, acting as Jimmy's bodyguard, misunderstands the interaction due to wearing headphones, and strikes the cop over the head with a bag of sandwiches, leading to an assault charge. As the cop has previously interacted with Huell, he plays up his injuries, and the assistant district attorney seeks to subject Huell to a sentence of several years in prison as a repeat offender. Jimmy enlists Kim's aid to defend Huell, but she refuses to ruin the cop's reputation.  Instead, Kim and Jimmy arrange for a false show of support for Huell that results in the prosecutor accepting a plea bargain that keeps him out of prison. With Kim elated by the thrill of the scam, she convinces Jimmy to help her run a con that enables her to replace approved plans for a Mesa Verde branch in Lubbock, Texas with plans for a bigger building.\n\nJimmy's request for reinstatement is denied, and he learns it was because he failed to show remorse for Chuck's death.  To prepare for his appeal, Kim and Jimmy carry out several public displays that enable him to fake remorse, including dedicating a law library reading room in Chuck's name at the [[University of New Mexico]]. Jimmy makes a speech to the appeal panel about wanting to do justice to the McGill name, convincing them to reinstate his license. He then shocks Kim by obtaining a [[doing business as|DBA]] application, revealing that the speech was an insincere con, and that he intends to resume practicing law under the name Saul Goodman.\n\n==== Season 5 ====\n{{See also|Better Call Saul (season 5)}}\nJimmy's law license is reinstated and he tells Kim he realized that continuing to use the \"Saul Goodman\" alias from his prepaid cell phone business gives him an instant client base for a new criminal law practice. His relationship with Kim is strained when he encourages her to use a con to convince one of her ''pro bono'' clients to accept a favorable plea bargain. After refusing Jimmy's offer, Kim runs the con herself, but later tells Jimmy she does not want to lie to succeed, and he agrees not to engage in ethically questionable activities when her clients are involved. Nacho brings Jimmy to Lalo when Domingo is arrested, and they work out a plan to free Domingo by giving information about Gus's dead drops to give to Hank and Steve at the DEA and pretending that Domingo is willing to become Hank's confidential informant. Lalo is pleased with the result, and Jimmy realizes he will have to continue working for the Salamancas, because as Nacho tells him \"Once you're in, you're in.\" Jimmy meets Howard for lunch, where Howard apologizes for the firm's past treatment of Jimmy and offers him a position at HHM. Jimmy continues to be unnerved by Howard's reminders of his past and uses three bowling balls to damage Howard's car. After representing two prostitutes in court, Jimmy pays them to loudly disrupt Howard's lunch with Clifford Main.\n\nEverett Acker lives on land owned by Mesa Verde bank, which wants him to move so the bank can construct a new [[call center]]. Kim is sympathetic to Acker and Kevin refuses to compromise, so Kim asks Jimmy as Saul to represent Acker against the bank. Jimmy engages in several tactics the delay construction, but Kevin still refuses to compromise, so Kim resigns herself to Acker's eviction. Jimmy suggests they could search for \"dirt\" on Kevin and blackmail him into a compromise, but also advises against it. Kim decides to proceed, so Jimmy hires Sobchak to surveil Kevin and search his house. Kim sees something in Sobchak's photos of Kevin's house that can be used against Kevin. Rich suggests that Kim remove herself from Mesa Verde business, correctly deducing that her heart is not in it, but she angrily refuses.\n\nKim later tells Jimmy she does not want to proceed with blackmailing Kevin and offers Acker $75,000 to settle, promising to personally make up the difference between that figure and the amount Kevin agrees to pay. Jimmy agrees but at the meeting to finalize the deal, he stuns everyone by demanding $4 million. Kim's insight into Sobchak's photos is that Mesa Verde's logo is based on a photograph the bank does not have permission to use. Kevin ridicules Jimmy' demand, and Jimmy pressures him with threats of an injunction against using the logo and TV ads soliciting potential clients for class action lawsuits against the bank which show Kevin's father Don in an unfavorable light. Kevin meets with Jimmy privately and agrees to a settlement that includes payments to both Acker and the photographer. Kim returns home and an apprehensive Jimmy suggests they have cause to celebrate, but Kim is furious and vents her anger at Jimmy for making her the \"sucker\" in his con.  Kim suggests to Jimmy that they separate, but then proposes marriage. They marry the next day, attaching [[spousal privilege]] to their conversations, which means Jimmy will not have to lie to Kim about his activities. \n\nWhen Lalo is charged with the murder of Fred the money wire clerk, Lalo asks Jimmy to obtain his release on bail so that he does not go to trial, and promises Jimmy will become wealthy as a \"friend of the cartel\" if he succeeds. Gus also desires Lalo's release, so Mike provide Jimmy details on the investigative work he did under an assumed name to have Lalo arrested. Jimmy uses the information to accuse police of witness tampering, and the judge grants bail but sets it at $7 million cash. Lalo stuns Jimmy by saying he can afford to pay it, but says Jimmy will have to pick up the money for him. Howard sees Jimmy at the courthouse and asks if he has decided whether to accept his offer to join HHM. Jimmy says he is still considering it, but Howard realizes Jimmy is toying with him. Howard confronts Jimmy over his recent harassment of Howard, and Jimmy angrily blames Howard for Chuck's death and says Jimmy/Saul has grown too big for the constraints of a job at HHM.\n\nLalo requests that Jimmy transport the cash for his bail. Jimmy is reluctant, but agrees after Lalo accepts his request of a $100,000 fee. Kim is unable to persuade Jimmy not to go, so he drives to a remote desert site. The Cousins deliver two bags of cash, then immediately depart. Jimmy is ambushed by several gunmen. They take the cash and are about to kill him when they are attacked. The unseen shooter is Mike, who tracked Jimmy at Gus's behest. He kills all but one gunman, who escapes in the only truck that is still drivable. Mike and Jimmy put the cash back in Jimmy's car and begin the trip back to Albuquerque. When the car breaks down, they push it over the edge of the road and begin to walk cross-country to avoid the surviving gunman. They camp out overnight, and Jimmy reveals to Mike that Kim knows some details of his activities. Mike warns Jimmy that if Kim knows about the Salamancas, she is now \"in the game\". They resume their trek the next day, and an exhausted, dehydrated, and sunburned Jimmy gives up. Mike spots the surviving gunman and intends to hide and wait. Instead, Jimmy runs to the edge of the road to attract his attention and draw him in. When the gunman is close enough, Mike shoots him. The gunman's truck flips and is destroyed. Mike and Jimmy resume their walk, now on the road.\n\nJimmy and Mike make their way to a truck stop, where Tyrus and Victor pick them up. They agree on a cover story for Jimmy to tell Lalo. Jimmy posts Lalo's bail and Lalo is released. Jimmy tells Lalo he was alone and his car broke down, so he walked to avoid putting the money at risk. Lalo says he plans to return to Mexico to avoid the scrutiny of suspicious police and prosecutors. Jimmy tells Kim the same story, but she realizes he is lying and tells him she will be ready to listen when he is ready to talk. Jimmy tells Mike he is experiencing [[posttraumatic stress disorder|posttraumatic stress]]. Mike tells Jimmy it will pass with time. Nacho brings Lalo to the same pickup point where Jimmy received the money. Instead of waiting for The Cousins, he searches for Jimmy's car. After he finds it, he tells Nacho to drive back to Albuquerque. Mike calls to warn Jimmy just before Lalo arrives at Kim and Jimmy's apartment. As Mike trains a sniper rifle on Lalo from a nearby roof, Lalo has Jimmy repeat the story of his desert trek, then reveals he found bullet holes in Jimmy's car. Kim argues that passersby probably shot at the car for fun and berates Lalo for not trusting Jimmy. Lalo seems satisfied and departs. He tells Nacho they are going to Mexico, but not to the original pickup site.\n\nFollowing the confrontation with Lalo, Jimmy confides in Kim the events in the desert. They decide to check into a hotel after agreeing that it's not safe to stay at their apartment. After checking into the hotel, despite Jimmy's misgivings, Kim continues her ''pro bono'' work at the courthouse. While there, she is approached by Howard who tells her about Jimmy's harassment of him and, upon learning of her resignation from Schweikart & Cokely, suggests that it is due to Jimmy's influence. Jimmy, fearing for Kim's safety, confronts Mike at his home. After repeated questioning, Mike tells Jimmy that a hit on Lalo is planned and that Lalo will be dead by the following day. Reassured, Jimmy tells Kim and suggests they check out of the hotel although Kim convinces him to stay for the night that they paid for. Over dinner, Kim tells Jimmy about Howard - asserting that Howard only did so because of his own ego. She suggests they continue to prank Howard and, later, suggests more serious cons that would leave Howard vulnerable to charges of misconduct that could force an earlier settlement of the Sandpiper case, giving Jimmy a $2 million share. Kim initially dismisses the idea, but the next day appears enthusiastic about proceeding. Jimmy warns that it amounts to a [[scorched earth]] tactic but Kim uses a finger-pointing gesture similar to those used by Saul Goodman to indicate that she wants to proceed.\n\n=== ''Breaking Bad'' ===\n[[File:Bob Odenkirk and Emily Rios 2011 at Breaking Bad set.jpg|thumb|Bob Odenkirk as Saul Goodman on the set of ''Breaking Bad'' during the filming of the fourth season, with [[Emily Rios]] ([[Andrea Cantillo]])]]\nBy the time of Saul's introduction in ''Breaking Bad'', he has fully adopted the name \"Saul Goodman\", and rarely mentions the name McGill.

Saul has already offered to be Badger's legal counsel and has learned that the DEA hopes Badger will lead them to \"Heisenberg\". Walt poses as Badger's uncle and goes to Saul's office, where he learns that Saul will advise Badger to reveal his associates in order to avoid prison. Walt offers Saul a bribe to keep Badger from \"flipping\", but Saul refuses.\n\nWalt and Jesse kidnap Saul and threaten to kill him if he does not keep Badger from informing. Saul, initially worried that the two are from Lalo or Nacho, sees through their scare tactics, takes a token payment so he can give them legal advice protected by attorney-client privilege, and tells them about Jimmy \"In-'N-Out\" Kilkelly (Jimmy Daniels), who makes a living confessing to the crimes of others and going to prison.  Saul arranges for Kilkelly to be arrested and confess to being Heisenberg.  The DEA busts Kilkelly when Badger meets with him for a drug deal, but Hank is not completely convinced. Later, Saul visits Walt at his school.  He informs Walt that he was too easy to find and offers to be his full-time legal counsel, money launderer, and adviser with respect to protecting his identity.\n\nCombo (Rodney Rush), Jesse's friend and one of their dealers, is killed by a rival gang, and Jesse's friends refuse to sell any further. Saul helps Walt and Jesse out by promising to contact another dealer, Gus, though warns the pair that Gus is very selective of whom he does business with. Walter ultimately convinces Gus to buy their latest batch valued at nearly one million dollars, but Gus expresses strong reservations about Jesse's drug addiction and trustworthiness.\n\n==== Season 3 ====\n{{See also|Breaking Bad (season 3)}}\nTo help launder Walt's drug money, Saul uses the website his son Walter Jr. ([[R.J. Mitte]]) set up for donors to contribute to Walt's [[chemotherapy]], making the drug cash look like small donations from numerous contributors. Saul also helps Jesse anonymously buy his aunt's house back from his parents with his share of the drug money. Saul and Mike bug Walt's wife Skyler's ([[Anna Gunn]]) house to find out if she has told anyone about Walt. Saul attempts to get Jesse to convince Walt to resume cooking methamphetamine. After an altercation between Walt and Skyler's boss Ted Beneke ([[Christopher Cousins]]), Mike brings Walt to Saul. Walt figures out that Saul has been bugging his house and attacks him, causing Saul to refuse to launder any more money through Walter Jr.'s website. Jesse visits Saul with methamphetamine he produced and asks for a meeting with Gus, at which Gus agrees to buy Jesse's product, assuming it will be an incentive to Walt.  Saul sets up a meeting between Jesse and Walt to resolve the issue of Jesse's half of the money from their previous work for Gus.  Walt agrees to resume meth production for Gus, with Gale Boetticher ([[David Costabile]]) as his assistant, so Saul changes sides and agrees to launder Walt's new income.\n\nWhen Walt's brother-in-law [[Hank Schrader]] ([[Dean Norris]]), a [[DEA]] agent, is close to catching Jesse in the recreational vehicle Walt and he use as a meth lab, and learning that Walt is with him, Walt calls Saul.  Saul has his secretary Francesca ([[Tina Parker]]) pose as a [[Albuquerque Police Department]] dispatcher falsely claiming that Hank\u2019s wife Marie ([[Betsy Brandt]]) has been in a car accident, luring Hank away to the hospital, thus giving Jesse and Walt enough time to destroy the RV. Nevertheless, Saul feels guilty about his part in the cruel ruse. Frustrated at losing his potential arrest of Jesse, Hank attacks Jesse at his home. Saul visits a hospitalized Jesse, who threatens to expose Walt's identity. Saul and Walt consider killing Jesse, but decide against it.  Saul tries to convince Jesse to buy commercial properties to launder his money but Jesse rejects the idea. Saul discusses plans for money laundering with Skyler and Walt, floating the idea of buying a laser tag business.  Skyler wants to buy Walt's former employer Bogdan's ([[Marius Stan (actor)|Marius Stan]]) car wash, believing it is a much more plausible front business. Walt visits Saul to discuss Jesse's plan to kill two dealers who work for Gus and killed Jesse's friend Combo and his girlfriend Andrea's ([[Emily Rios]]) brother Tom\u00e1s ([[Angelo Martinez]]). Mike threatens Saul in order to obtain Jesse's location, intending to kill him before he acts against the dealers, but Saul sends Mike to the wrong location. Saul helps Jesse hide and later arranges for Jesse and Walt to meet at the laser tag arcade.\n\n==== Season 4 ====\n{{See also|Breaking Bad (season 4)}}\nSaul and Skyler plot ways to persuade Bogdan to sell the car wash, but Skyler rules out violence or intimidation. Saul has his employee Patrick Kuby ([[Bill Burr]]) pose as a government inspector to inform Bogdan of supposed environmental concerns that will cost hundreds of thousands of dollars to mitigate.  Bogdan sells the car wash to Walt and Skyler, and Skyler takes over day-to-day management. Walt confides in Saul about his concerns with respect to Jesse, Hank, and Gus. Saul tells Walt about Ed the \"disappearer\" ([[Robert Forster]]), a vacuum repair shop owner who can provide Walt and his family new identities if they have to flee. Walt runs over Gus' two dealers before Jesse can kill them, then tells Jesse to run. Saul helps ensure the damage to Walt's car is not discovered.  Walt suggests that Gus will retaliate for the murder of the two dealers and recommends that Saul contact a hit man to kill Gus, but Saul dismisses the idea. At Jesse's behest, Saul visits Andrea and tries to give her Jesse's remaining cash.\n\nTo protect Skyler from the IRS investigation into Beneke's tax fraud, Saul gives him $620,000 of Walt's cash to pay the tax bill by passing off the money as an inheritance from a fake relative. Ted plans to spend the cash, so Saul sends Kuby and his other employee Huell Babineaux ([[Lavell Crawford]]) to force him to pay the IRS, and after Beneke signs the check he tries to run away, trips, and injures himself. After Gus threatens Walt, Walt demands Saul set up a meeting with Ed so his family can escape. Walt asks Saul to tip off the DEA about Gus directing his assassins Marcos ([[Daniel Moncada]]) and Leonel Salamanca ([[Luis Moncada]]) to attack Hank. Saul agrees but refuses to mention Gus' name. Saul persuades Jesse to come to his office, and has Huell secretly steal the [[ricin]] cigarette Walt gave Jesse to use in killing Gus. Saul gives Jesse his money and tells him to leave Albuquerque for his own safety. Jesse realizes the ricin is gone. Andrea's son Brock ([[Ian Posada]]) is poisoned and Jesse tells the doctors to check for ricin, believing that Walt is responsible. Walt persuades Jesse that Gus poisoned Brock, however, so Jesse agrees to help him kill Gus. Saul goes into hiding, but returns to represent Jesse when he is questioned about Brock's poisoning. Saul discovers from Jesse that Gus regularly visits Hector Salamanca ([[Mark Margolis]]) in a nursing home.  Saul passes the information to Walt, who uses it in a plot to kill Gus.\n\n==== Season 5 ====\n{{See also|Breaking Bad (season 5)}}\n\n===== Part 1 =====\nSaul tells Skyler about Beneke's accident, which has left him hospitalized and immobile. Walt is angry with Saul about Saul's payment to Beneke, while Saul is upset at Walt for poisoning Brock (as revealed in the previous season's finale episode), revealing that he knew about it all along. He attempts to end his relationship with Walt, but Walt intimidates him into continuing their business arrangement. With Gus dead, Saul tries to convince Walt to stop making meth, but Walt says he has to continue because he needs the cash. Saul hosts a meeting between Mike, Jesse, and Walt, where they agree to set up a new meth-producing business. Saul helps Walt and Jesse look for new locations, and they agree on Ira's business, Vamanos Pest Control, as the best option. Saul defends Mike from the DEA's investigation by threatening litigation over their supposed harassment. The DEA learns that Mike's lawyer Dan Wachsberger ([[Chris Freihofer]]) is the conduit for Mike's hush money payments to Gus's former employees and Mike's hiding cash for his daughter-in-law Stacey ([[Kerry Condon]]) and granddaughter Kaylee (Abigail Zoe Lewis). Mike asks Saul to retrieve the \"go bag\" with cash and false identity documents that he previously hid. Saul is unable, however, and has Walt do it. When Mike refuses to divulge the names of Gus' former employees so Walt can have them killed to protect his identity, Walt shoots and kills him. Jesse tries to have Saul take the $5 million Jesse made stealing a trainload of [[methylamine]] and distribute it to Kaylee and the parents of Drew Sharp, a young boy whom cartel minion Todd Alquist ([[Jesse Plemons]]) killed during the theft. Saul refuses, saying the attempt to move the cash will attract more police scrutiny. Jesse attempts to get rid of the money in other ways, including throwing it onto random lawns and leaving it in random mailboxes. Saul calls Walt to inform him of Jesse's erratic behavior.\n\n===== Part 2 =====\nWalt visits Saul to tell him that Hank has learned that Walt is Heisenberg. Saul suggests killing Hank, but Walt refuses. Jesse is arrested while tossing money from his car, and Saul obtains his release from police custody. Saul arranges a meeting between Walt and Jesse, and Walt convinces Jesse to contact Ed and start a new life. Saul wants Jesse to give up drugs before beginning the trip, but Jesse refuses, so Saul has Huell pickpocket Jesse's cannabis. When Jesse realizes his marijuana was stolen, he figures out that Huell must have also stolen the ricin cigarette, meaning that Walt poisoned Brock and Saul knew. Instead of leaving with Ed, Jesse returns to Saul's office and assaults him. Saul admits he had Huell steal the ricin, but says he did not know what Walt intended. Saul calls Walt to warn him that Jesse knows the truth about what happened to Brock. Saul meets with Walt and suggests killing Jesse. After the DEA manipulates Huell into telling them what happened to Walt's money, Saul is afraid for his life and meets with Walt at the car wash. Believing his arrest is imminent, Walt goes into hiding. Saul and Walt both contact Ed, who sets up a new life for Saul as Gene, the manager of a Cinnabon in [[Omaha, Nebraska]]. Walt tries to persuade Saul to go with him instead of going to Omaha, and to contact hit men to kill his former dealing associate Jack Welker ([[Michael Bowen (actor)|Michael Bowen]]) in retaliation for killing Hank, but Saul refuses. Walt tries to intimidate Saul but doubles over in a coughing fit. Saul leaves Walt in Ed's basement and begins his trip to Omaha.\n\n=== Post-''Breaking Bad'' ===\nThough Saul does not appear in ''[[El Camino: A Breaking Bad Movie]]'', Ed refers to him when Jesse attempts to persuade Ed to help him leave Albuquerque and begin a new life.<ref>{{cite news |last=Harding |first=Amanda |date=October 15, 2019 |title=Did 'El Camino: A Breaking Bad Movie' Just Predict a Tragic Ending for Saul Goodman In 'Better Call Saul'? |url=https://www.cheatsheet.com/entertainment/did-el-camino-a-breaking-bad-movie-just-predict-a-tragic-ending-for-saul-goodman-in-better-call-saul.html/ |work=Showbiz Cheat Sheet}}</ref>  In addition, a scene in the film shows that the strip mall location of Saul's former law office has become a restaurant and sports bar.<ref>{{cite news |date=October 12, 2019 |title=El Camino answers many burning Breaking Bad questions |url=https://www.news.com.au/entertainment/movies/new-movies/el-camino-answers-many-burning-breaking-bad-questions/news-story/f6fb2d768803a3d15ff8d15b5dbe8728 |work=[[News.com.au]] |location=Sydney, Australia}}</ref>\n\nThe season premieres of ''Better Call Saul'' open with black-and-white [[Flashforward|flash forwards]] that take place after ''Breaking Bad'', showing that after leaving Albuquerque, Saul relocates to Omaha, Nebraska under the alias Gene Takavic, keeping a low profile as a manager of a [[Cinnabon]] store.

In honoring him in its Award Ceremony Speech, the [[Swedish Academy]] said that the novel \"occupies a special position\" in Hesse's work.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/literature/laureates/1946/press.html|title=The Nobel Prize in Literature 1946 \u2013 Hermann Hesse: Award Ceremony Speech|publisher=The Nobel Foundation|accessdate=2014-02-20}}</ref>\n\n\"Glass Bead Game\" is a literal translation of the German title, but the book has also been published under the title '''''Magister Ludi''''', [[Latin]] for \"Master of the Game\", which is an honorific title awarded to the book's central character. \"Magister Ludi\" can also be seen as a [[pun]]: ''ludus'' is a Latin word meaning both \"game\" and \"school\". However, the title Magister Ludi is misleading, as it implies the book is a straightforward [[bildungsroman]]. In reality, the book touches on many different genres, and the bulk of the story is on one level a parody of the biography genre.<ref>Theodore Ziolkowski, Foreword to The Glass Bead Game, p. xix. Picador. {{ISBN|0-312-27849-7}}.   Ziolkowski cites [[Thomas Mann]]'s recognition of the source of the book's humor as \"the parody of biography and the grave scholarly attitude.\"</ref>\n\n==Description==\n''The Glass Bead Game'' takes place at an unspecified date centuries into the future. Hesse suggested that he imagined the book's narrator writing around the start of the 25th century.<ref>[[Theodore Ziolkowski]], Foreword to ''The Glass Bead Game'', p. xii. Owl Books. {{ISBN|0-8050-1246-X}}</ref> The setting is a fictional province of central Europe called [[Castalia]], which was reserved by political decision for the life of the mind; technology and economic life are kept to a strict minimum. Castalia is home to an austere order of [[intellectual]]s with a twofold mission: to run boarding schools, and to cultivate and play the Glass Bead Game, whose exact nature remains elusive and whose devotees occupy a special school within Castalia known as Waldzell. The rules of the game are only alluded to\u2014they are so sophisticated that they are not easy to imagine. Playing the game well requires years of hard study of music, mathematics, and cultural history. The game is essentially an abstract synthesis of all arts and sciences. It proceeds by players making deep connections between seemingly unrelated topics.\n\nThe novel is an example of a [[bildungsroman]], following the life of a distinguished member of the Castalian Order, Joseph Knecht, whose surname means \"servant\" (and is [[cognate]] with the English word ''knight''). The plot chronicles Knecht's education as a youth, his decision to join the order, his mastery of the Game, and his advancement in the order's hierarchy to eventually become ''Magister Ludi'', the executive officer of the Castalian Order's game administrators.<ref>{{Cite book| last = Hesse | first = Hermann | authorlink = Hermann Hesse | title = The Glass Bead Game | publisher = Owl Books |year=1943 | pages = 352\u2013354 | isbn = 0-8050-1246-X }}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nThe beginning of the novel introduces the Music Master, the resident of Castalia who recruits Knecht as a young student and who is to have the most long-lasting and profound effect on Knecht throughout his life. At one point, as the Music Master nears death in his home at Monteport, Knecht obliquely refers to the Master's \"sainthood\". Knecht also develops another meaningful friendship with Plinio Designori, a student from a politically influential family, who is studying in Castalia as a guest, and holds vigorous debates with Designori, who views Castalia as an \"[[ivory tower]]\" with little to no impact on the outside world.\n\nAlthough educated within Castalia, Knecht's path to \"Magister Ludi\" is atypical for the order, as he spends a significant portion of his time after graduation outside the boundaries of the province. His first such venture, to the Bamboo Grove, results in his learning Chinese and becoming something of a disciple to Elder Brother, a recluse who had given up living within Castalia. Next, as part of an assignment to foster goodwill between the order and the [[Catholic Church]], Knecht is sent on several \"missions\" to the [[Benedictine Order|Benedictine]] monastery of Mariafels, where he befriends the historian Father Jacobus \u2013 a relationship which also has profound personal impact for Knecht.\n\nAs the novel progresses, Knecht begins to question his loyalty to the order, gradually coming to doubt that the intellectually gifted have a right to withdraw from life's big problems. Knecht, too, comes to see Castalia as a kind of ivory tower, an ethereal and protected community, devoted to pure intellectual pursuits but oblivious to the problems posed by life outside its borders. This conclusion precipitates a personal crisis, and, according to his personal views regarding spiritual awakening, Knecht does the unthinkable: he resigns as Magister Ludi and asks to leave the order, ostensibly to become of value and service to the larger culture. The heads of the order deny his request to leave, but Knecht departs Castalia anyway, initially taking a job as a tutor to his childhood friend Designori's energetic and strong-willed son, Tito. Only a few days later, the story ends abruptly with Knecht drowning in a mountain lake while attempting to follow Tito on a swim for which Knecht was unfit.\n\nThe fictional narrator leaves off before the final sections of the book, remarking that the end of the story is beyond the scope of his biography. The concluding chapter, entitled \"The Legend\", is reportedly from a different biography. After this final chapter, several of Knecht's \"posthumous\" works are then presented. The first section contains Knecht's poetry from various periods of his life, followed by three short stories labeled \"Three Lives\". The stories are presented as exercises by Knecht imagining his life had he been born in another time and place. The first story tells of a [[pagan]] [[Rain dance|rainmaker]] named Knecht who lived \"many thousands of years ago, when [[Matriarchy|women ruled]]\".<ref>Hermann Hesse. ''The Glass Bead Game''. Penguin. Hammondsworth 1975 p 416.</ref> Eventually the [[shaman]]'s powers to summon rain fail, and he offers himself as a sacrifice for the good of the tribe. The second story is based on the life of [[Hilarion|St Hilarion]] and tells of Josephus, an early Christian hermit who acquires a reputation for piety but is inwardly troubled by self-loathing and seeks a confessor, only to find that same penitent had been seeking him.\n\nThe final story concerns the life of Dasa, a prince wrongfully usurped by his half brother as heir to a kingdom and disguised as a [[Cowman (profession)|cowherd]] to save his life. While working with the herdsmen as a young boy, Dasa encounters a [[yogi]] in [[meditation]] in the forest. He wishes to experience the same tranquility as the yogi, but is unable to stay. He later leaves the herdsmen and marries a beautiful young woman, only to be [[cuckolded]] by his half brother (now the Rajah). In a cold fury, he kills his half brother and finds himself once again in the forest with the old yogi, who, through an experience of an alternate life, guides him on the spiritual path and out of the world of illusion ([[Maya (illusion)|Maya]]).\n\nThe three lives, together with that as Magister Ludi, oscillate between extroversion (rainmaker, Indian life \u2013 both get married) and introversion (father confessor, Magister Ludi) while developing the four basic psychic functions of [[analytical psychology]]: sensation (rainmaker), intuition (Indian life), feeling (father confessor), and thinking (Magister Ludi).\n\n===Earlier plans===\nOriginally, Hesse intended several different lives of the same person as he is reincarnated.<ref>[[Theodore Ziolkowski]], Foreword to ''The Glass Bead Game'', p. xiv-xv. [[Picador]]. {{ISBN|0-312-27849-7}}</ref> Instead, he focused on a story set in the future and placed the three shorter stories, \"authored\" by Knecht in ''The Glass Bead Game'', at the end of the novel.\n\nTwo drafts of a fourth life were published in 1965, the second version being recast in the first person and breaking off earlier.<ref>''Prosa aus dem Nachlass'' (Suhrkamp 1965), translated by [[Ralph Manheim]] in ''Tales of Student Life'' (Farrar, Straus and Giroux 1976)</ref>  Dated 1934, they describe Knecht's childhood and education as a Swabian theologian. This Knecht has been born some dozen years after the [[Treaty of Rijswijk]] in the time of [[Eberhard Louis, Duke of W\u00fcrttemberg|Eberhard Ludwig]], and in depicting the other characters Hesse draws heavily on actual biographies: [[Friedrich Christoph Oetinger]], [[Johann Friedrich Rock]], [[Johann Albrecht Bengel]] and [[Nicolaus Zinzendorf]] make up the cast of [[Pietism|Pietist]] mentors. Knecht is heavily drawn to music however, both that of the acknowledged master [[Pachelbel]] and the more exotic [[Dieterich Buxtehude|Buxtehude]]. The fragment breaks off as the young contemporary of [[Johann Sebastian Bach|Bach]] happens upon an organ recital in Stuttgart.\n\n===Central characters===\n* Joseph Knecht: The story's main character. He is the Magister Ludi for a majority of the book.\n* The Music Master: Knecht's spiritual mentor who, when Knecht is a child, examines him for entrance into the elite schools of Castalia.\n* Plinio Designori: Knecht's foil in the world outside.\n* Father Jacobus: Benedictine monk and Joseph Knecht's antithesis in faith.\n* Elder Brother: A former Castalian and student of various Chinese scripts & ideologies.\n* Thomas van der Trave: Joseph Knecht's predecessor as Magister Ludi.\n* Fritz Tegularius: A friend of Knecht's but a portent of what Castalians might become if they remain insular.\n\n==Castalia==\nCastalia, where most of the novel is set, is described in English translation as the 'pedagogical province'.  It forms part of a large and prosperous state whose leaders are broadly but not uncritically sympathetic to the Castalian ideal of scholarship.\n\nCastalia is an entirely male community, whose members are or aspire to be members of a secular Order similar to [[Monasticism|monastic orders]]. Prospective members are recruited in their pre-/early teens from the most promising scholars in its host state's regular schools.  One of Castalia's roles (not explored in depth in the book) is provision of schoolteachers to its host state.  Another is the advancement of learning, primarily in the fields of mathematics, [[musicology]] (of Western music up to the 18th century), [[philology]] and the history of art.

However, the title Magister Ludi is misleading, as it implies the book is a straightforward [[bildungsroman]]. In reality, the book touches on many different genres, and the bulk of the story is on one level a parody of the biography genre.<ref>Theodore Ziolkowski, Foreword to The Glass Bead Game, p. xix. Picador. {{ISBN|0-312-27849-7}}.   Ziolkowski cites [[Thomas Mann]]'s recognition of the source of the book's humor as \"the parody of biography and the grave scholarly attitude.\"</ref>\n\n==Description==\n''The Glass Bead Game'' takes place at an unspecified date centuries into the future. Hesse suggested that he imagined the book's narrator writing around the start of the 25th century.<ref>[[Theodore Ziolkowski]], Foreword to ''The Glass Bead Game'', p. xii. Owl Books. {{ISBN|0-8050-1246-X}}</ref> The setting is a fictional province of central Europe called [[Castalia]], which was reserved by political decision for the life of the mind; technology and economic life are kept to a strict minimum. Castalia is home to an austere order of [[intellectual]]s with a twofold mission: to run boarding schools, and to cultivate and play the Glass Bead Game, whose exact nature remains elusive and whose devotees occupy a special school within Castalia known as Waldzell. The rules of the game are only alluded to\u2014they are so sophisticated that they are not easy to imagine. Playing the game well requires years of hard study of music, mathematics, and cultural history. The game is essentially an abstract synthesis of all arts and sciences. It proceeds by players making deep connections between seemingly unrelated topics.\n\nThe novel is an example of a [[bildungsroman]], following the life of a distinguished member of the Castalian Order, Joseph Knecht, whose surname means \"servant\" (and is [[cognate]] with the English word ''knight''). The plot chronicles Knecht's education as a youth, his decision to join the order, his mastery of the Game, and his advancement in the order's hierarchy to eventually become ''Magister Ludi'', the executive officer of the Castalian Order's game administrators.<ref>{{Cite book| last = Hesse | first = Hermann | authorlink = Hermann Hesse | title = The Glass Bead Game | publisher = Owl Books |year=1943 | pages = 352\u2013354 | isbn = 0-8050-1246-X }}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nThe beginning of the novel introduces the Music Master, the resident of Castalia who recruits Knecht as a young student and who is to have the most long-lasting and profound effect on Knecht throughout his life. At one point, as the Music Master nears death in his home at Monteport, Knecht obliquely refers to the Master's \"sainthood\". Knecht also develops another meaningful friendship with Plinio Designori, a student from a politically influential family, who is studying in Castalia as a guest, and holds vigorous debates with Designori, who views Castalia as an \"[[ivory tower]]\" with little to no impact on the outside world.\n\nAlthough educated within Castalia, Knecht's path to \"Magister Ludi\" is atypical for the order, as he spends a significant portion of his time after graduation outside the boundaries of the province. His first such venture, to the Bamboo Grove, results in his learning Chinese and becoming something of a disciple to Elder Brother, a recluse who had given up living within Castalia. Next, as part of an assignment to foster goodwill between the order and the [[Catholic Church]], Knecht is sent on several \"missions\" to the [[Benedictine Order|Benedictine]] monastery of Mariafels, where he befriends the historian Father Jacobus \u2013 a relationship which also has profound personal impact for Knecht.\n\nAs the novel progresses, Knecht begins to question his loyalty to the order, gradually coming to doubt that the intellectually gifted have a right to withdraw from life's big problems. Knecht, too, comes to see Castalia as a kind of ivory tower, an ethereal and protected community, devoted to pure intellectual pursuits but oblivious to the problems posed by life outside its borders. This conclusion precipitates a personal crisis, and, according to his personal views regarding spiritual awakening, Knecht does the unthinkable: he resigns as Magister Ludi and asks to leave the order, ostensibly to become of value and service to the larger culture. The heads of the order deny his request to leave, but Knecht departs Castalia anyway, initially taking a job as a tutor to his childhood friend Designori's energetic and strong-willed son, Tito. Only a few days later, the story ends abruptly with Knecht drowning in a mountain lake while attempting to follow Tito on a swim for which Knecht was unfit.\n\nThe fictional narrator leaves off before the final sections of the book, remarking that the end of the story is beyond the scope of his biography. The concluding chapter, entitled \"The Legend\", is reportedly from a different biography. After this final chapter, several of Knecht's \"posthumous\" works are then presented. The first section contains Knecht's poetry from various periods of his life, followed by three short stories labeled \"Three Lives\". The stories are presented as exercises by Knecht imagining his life had he been born in another time and place. The first story tells of a [[pagan]] [[Rain dance|rainmaker]] named Knecht who lived \"many thousands of years ago, when [[Matriarchy|women ruled]]\".<ref>Hermann Hesse. ''The Glass Bead Game''. Penguin. Hammondsworth 1975 p 416.</ref> Eventually the [[shaman]]'s powers to summon rain fail, and he offers himself as a sacrifice for the good of the tribe. The second story is based on the life of [[Hilarion|St Hilarion]] and tells of Josephus, an early Christian hermit who acquires a reputation for piety but is inwardly troubled by self-loathing and seeks a confessor, only to find that same penitent had been seeking him.\n\nThe final story concerns the life of Dasa, a prince wrongfully usurped by his half brother as heir to a kingdom and disguised as a [[Cowman (profession)|cowherd]] to save his life. While working with the herdsmen as a young boy, Dasa encounters a [[yogi]] in [[meditation]] in the forest. He wishes to experience the same tranquility as the yogi, but is unable to stay. He later leaves the herdsmen and marries a beautiful young woman, only to be [[cuckolded]] by his half brother (now the Rajah). In a cold fury, he kills his half brother and finds himself once again in the forest with the old yogi, who, through an experience of an alternate life, guides him on the spiritual path and out of the world of illusion ([[Maya (illusion)|Maya]]).\n\nThe three lives, together with that as Magister Ludi, oscillate between extroversion (rainmaker, Indian life \u2013 both get married) and introversion (father confessor, Magister Ludi) while developing the four basic psychic functions of [[analytical psychology]]: sensation (rainmaker), intuition (Indian life), feeling (father confessor), and thinking (Magister Ludi).\n\n===Earlier plans===\nOriginally, Hesse intended several different lives of the same person as he is reincarnated.<ref>[[Theodore Ziolkowski]], Foreword to ''The Glass Bead Game'', p. xiv-xv. [[Picador]]. {{ISBN|0-312-27849-7}}</ref> Instead, he focused on a story set in the future and placed the three shorter stories, \"authored\" by Knecht in ''The Glass Bead Game'', at the end of the novel.\n\nTwo drafts of a fourth life were published in 1965, the second version being recast in the first person and breaking off earlier.<ref>''Prosa aus dem Nachlass'' (Suhrkamp 1965), translated by [[Ralph Manheim]] in ''Tales of Student Life'' (Farrar, Straus and Giroux 1976)</ref>  Dated 1934, they describe Knecht's childhood and education as a Swabian theologian. This Knecht has been born some dozen years after the [[Treaty of Rijswijk]] in the time of [[Eberhard Louis, Duke of W\u00fcrttemberg|Eberhard Ludwig]], and in depicting the other characters Hesse draws heavily on actual biographies: [[Friedrich Christoph Oetinger]], [[Johann Friedrich Rock]], [[Johann Albrecht Bengel]] and [[Nicolaus Zinzendorf]] make up the cast of [[Pietism|Pietist]] mentors. Knecht is heavily drawn to music however, both that of the acknowledged master [[Pachelbel]] and the more exotic [[Dieterich Buxtehude|Buxtehude]]. The fragment breaks off as the young contemporary of [[Johann Sebastian Bach|Bach]] happens upon an organ recital in Stuttgart.\n\n===Central characters===\n* Joseph Knecht: The story's main character. He is the Magister Ludi for a majority of the book.\n* The Music Master: Knecht's spiritual mentor who, when Knecht is a child, examines him for entrance into the elite schools of Castalia.\n* Plinio Designori: Knecht's foil in the world outside.\n* Father Jacobus: Benedictine monk and Joseph Knecht's antithesis in faith.\n* Elder Brother: A former Castalian and student of various Chinese scripts & ideologies.\n* Thomas van der Trave: Joseph Knecht's predecessor as Magister Ludi.\n* Fritz Tegularius: A friend of Knecht's but a portent of what Castalians might become if they remain insular.\n\n==Castalia==\nCastalia, where most of the novel is set, is described in English translation as the 'pedagogical province'.  It forms part of a large and prosperous state whose leaders are broadly but not uncritically sympathetic to the Castalian ideal of scholarship.\n\nCastalia is an entirely male community, whose members are or aspire to be members of a secular Order similar to [[Monasticism|monastic orders]]. Prospective members are recruited in their pre-/early teens from the most promising scholars in its host state's regular schools.  One of Castalia's roles (not explored in depth in the book) is provision of schoolteachers to its host state.  Another is the advancement of learning, primarily in the fields of mathematics, [[musicology]] (of Western music up to the 18th century), [[philology]] and the history of art.  This role is entirely analytical: creativity and scientific research appear to be dead.  A third role is to cultivate and develop the Glass Bead Game.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Hesse |first1=Hermann |title=The Glass Bead Game. |publisher=Vintage Classics. |isbn=978-0-09-928362-1 |page=passim}}</ref>\n\n==The game==\nThe Glass Bead Game is \"a kind of synthesis of human learning\"<ref name=\"Time1949\">\n\n{{Citation\n| title = Books: Master of the Game\n| newspaper = [[Time Magazine]]\n| date = 1949-10-17\n| url = http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,853996,00.html\n| accessdate = 2010-02-07\n}}</ref> in which themes, such as a musical phrase or a philosophical thought, are stated.

It is similar in design to the ''[[Frauenfriedenskirche]]'' (''Church of Our Lady of Peace'') in [[Bockenheim (Frankfurt am Main)|Frankfurt-Bockenheim]]. It was built by [[Martin Weber (architect)|Martin Weber]] from 1928 to 1929, on a rise then known as ''Bornheimer Hang''. The [[Church (building)|church]] is an unusual example of [[interwar]] modernism as [[sacred architecture|sacred]] [[Bauhaus#Architectural output|Bauhaus architecture]].\n\nThe church was finally completed on 25 August 1929 and handed to the Catholic congregation of Bornheim. It was damaged in the [[World War II|Second World War]], and afterwards rebuilt with money donated for this purpose.\n\nIt is branch church of the parish St. Josef and is part of the [[Diocese of Limburg]]. The diocese dedicated it from 1 August 2007 as the location of a ''[[Centre for Christian Meditation and Spirituality of the Diocese of Limburg|Centre for Christian Meditation and Spirituality]]''.<ref name=\"StJosef-Frankfurt-MeditationChurch\" /> The centre was directed from August 2007 until July 2018 by the Franciscan [[Helmut Schlegel]] [[Order of Friars Minor|OFM]],<ref name=\"hr-Helmut_Schlegel\" /> where he worked until June 2019 as a retreat and meditation leader and priestly co-worker. Since November 2018 the centre is directed by the theologian Samuel Stricker,<ref name=\"HK-Team\" /> who works with a team of contributors, for example from the order of Medical Missionary Sisters (MMS).<ref name=\"MMS-Frankfurt\" />\n\nSince the beginning of the restoration of the interior of [[St. Leonhard, Frankfurt|St. Leonhard]] in [[Altstadt (Frankfurt am Main)|Frankfurt-Altstadt]], the services of the local ''St. Leonhard's International English-Speaking Catholic Parish'' have been held in the Holy Cross Church since 7 May 2011.<ref name=\"English-Parish-Ffm\" /> This remains the home of the Holy Cross Church even after the end of the work.<ref name=\"Leonhard-FNP-13082019\" />\n\n== History ==\n=== 20th century ===\n==== Foundation ====\n[[File:Martin-Weber-Platz.jpg|thumb|Steeple]]\n[[File:Heilig Kreuz Figuren Sued-West 15032011.JPG|thumb|Four figures at the south side of the steeple, symmbolizing the Evangelists]]\n[[File:Bornheimer Hang Westen HK-Kirche 15032011.JPG|thumb|View from the east]]\n[[File:Heilig Kreuz Nordseite 25062010.JPG|thumb|North side of the nave]]\n[[File:Heilig Kreuz Innenraum 11112012.JPG|thumb|Interior, fifth anniversary of the Centre on 11 November 2012]]\n[[File:Thomas L\u00f6hr Heilig-Kreuz Frankfurt Bornheim 11112012.JPG|thumb|Dr. Thomas L\u00f6hr, Auxiliary bishop of Limburg, in 2012 during the fifth anniversary]]\n[[File:Heilig Kreuz Schweisstuch 20092009.JPG|thumb|[[Veil of Veronica]] at the southern wall of the steeple]]\n[[File:Heilig Kreuz Pieta 25062010.JPG|thumb|[[Piet\u00e0]] by Arnold Hensler in the entrance hall]]\n[[File:Heilig-Kreuz-Gedenktafel 21022009.JPG|thumb|[[Commemorative plaque]] inside the church]]\n[[File:Heilig Kreuz Orgel 17042019.JPG|thumb|The organ on the gallery]]\n[[File:Heilig Kreuz Kerzenlabyrinth 11122011.JPG|thumb|[[Advent]]-[[Labyrinth]] made with 2500 burning tealights the Saturday before [[Gaudete Sunday]] in 2011]]\n[[File:HK Advents-Labyrinth 14122013 100sec.ogg|thumb|thumbtime=84|Creation and use of [[Advent]] labyrinth in 2013]]\n[[File:Heilig Kreuz Weihnachtskrippe 25122012.JPG|thumb|[[Nativity scene]] in 2011 with crib by Arnold Hensler]]\n[[File:Heilig Kreuz Holzkreuz MvW 02092011.JPG|thumb|Wooden cruzifix in the crypt]]\nThe Holy Cross church was built in 1929 from the master of church building Martin Weber and is at the edge of the housing development at the ''Bornheimer Hang''. Martin Weber built also the churches ''St. Bonifatius'' in [[Sachsenhausen (Frankfurt am Main)|Frankfurt-Sachsenhausen]] in 1927 and [[Heilig Geist, Frankfurt|Heilig-Geist]] in [[Riederwald|Frankfurt-Riederwald]] in 1931. The planned community center at the end of the ''Wittelsbacher Allee'' was not built so there was enough space for building the new church. The Holy Cross Church was the second catholic church in Frankfurt-Bornheim. The [[Parish (Catholic Church)|parish]] was an outsourcing of the later neighbour fold ''St. Josef'', the first catholic church in Bornheim. Reason was the expansion of the quarter Bornheim eastward at the ''Bornheimer Hang'' with the new settlement of the town planner Ernst May who built many new apartment buildings. This caused a growing number of Catholics who were living in the quarter. On 3 August 1927 a jury decided in a competition for the draft with the name slope crown from the master of church building Martin Weber (1890-1941). The three other participators of the competition were Hans (1872\u20131952) and Christoph Rummel (1881\u20131961) (Frankfurt), Richard Steidle (1881\u20131958) ([[Munich]]) and Robert B. Witte ([[Dresden]]). There were several specifications for the architects like for example the front of the [[Steeple (architecture)|steeple]] at the ''Wittelsbacher Allee'', between 700 and 800 seats, a high altar and two side altars and an organ loft for 150 people. The building model was called by Martin Weber slope crown, since the church should crown the ''Bornheimer Hang'' (slope). On 19 February 1928 the construction work began with the first cut of the spade. The 18. March 1928 was the day of the laying of the foundation stone. The topping-out ceremony was celebrated on 14 September 1928. On 25 August 1929 the church was inaugurated by Ludwig Maria Hugo, the Bishop of the [[Diocese of Mainz]].<ref name=\"HK-Gille\" /> The name was selected, since medieval Frankfurt possessed several the [[Christian cross|holy cross]] dedicated places. One of it was the chapel of the hospital to the holy cross which was donated in 1343 by Wicker Frosch. It formed with the chapel of the cloister of ''St. Katharinen'' which was built in 1354 a small double church, the predecessor building of the today's Evangelical-Lutheran ''Katharinen church''.<ref name=\"HK-50years\" /> Until 1950 were the ''Holy Cross'' parish financially still a part of the ''St. Josef'' parish with which it has a common church executive committee.\n\n==== Second World War ====\nIn the time starting from 1933 also the ''Holy Cross'' parish was under suppression by the [[Nazism|National Socialists]] (\"Nazis\") and from 1939 has also lost fold members in the [[World War II|Second World War]]. The church was used because of its exposed position as a point of reference for the navigation of the [[bomber]]s of the [[United States Army Air Forces|USAAF]] and the [[Royal Air Force|RAF]]. The windows at the west side of the church were destroyed on 4 October 1943 by parts of an attack, which should meet the water works near the cemetery of Bornheim. During the first large-scale attack on Frankfurt in the evening of the same day also the windows of the eastern side and the parsonage building were destroyed by a [[bomb]] row, which came down in the garden plots at the ''Bornheimer Hang''. With the next large attack on the city on 29 January 1944 parsonage building was heavily met. At the night from the 18. to the 19. March 1944 the church was hit by several [[Incendiary device|incendiary bombs]], which pierced the roof timberwork. The bombs could extinguished inside the church. On 11 December 1944 the church was hit by three bombs, which tore the large outside staircase at the west side of the steeple and the auxiliary [[chapel]] in the steeple hall. Now a large hole was into the west side of the nave. The services had to be held thereafter in the heating plant room underneath the steeple.<ref name=\"HK-30years\" />\n\n==== Post-war period ====\nThe heating plant room underneath the steeple was used until 1. July 1946 as church. During the time of the reconstruction starting from 26 September 1948 the parish hall which is under the church was used as a church beneath the church. In 1950 ''Holy Cross'' became its own parish with its own church executive committee.<ref name=\"HK-30years\" /> 1951 the order for the re-establishment of the church could be given. 1952 the inside of the church were restored. The church windows were glazed new by the glass painter Lorenz Matheis with [[Stained glass|stained glass window]] in white and golden yellow colours. The walls and the ceiling were painted in a single-coloured finish. 1957 the [[kindergarten]] in the west of the church was built. In 1965 a stage for events was built in the parish hall under the church ship during a renovation. In 1968 the [[altar]] area was transformed, a consequence of the liturgy reformation by the [[Second Vatican Council]]. The altar was shifted, so that the priest could celebrate the service turned to the fold. A stone lectern replaced the torn off pulpit. The old altar under the great wall-cross in the chancel was replaced by the baptismal font. The ceiling got an orange and the walls a light-beige paint. In 1969 the first election of the parish council took place. In 1975 the board of directors elected by the parish council replaced the church executive committee. In 1990 a further transformation of the altar was executed. The [[baptism]]al font now was located in the entrance hall of the church. It was replaced by a sacramental altar at the place of the old high altar was built and the [[Church tabernacle|tabernacle]] was placed on it. Starting from 1991 the minister of the fold was also simultaneous ministers of the parish ''[[Maria Rosenkranz, Frankfurt|Maria-Rosenkranz]]'' (=[[Mary, mother of Jesus|Mary]] [[Rosary]]) in [[Frankfurt]]-[[Seckbach (Frankfurt am Main)|Seckbach]]. 1992 the church interior was restored to the original condition with the walls in a [[checkerboard]] pattern in light and dark red colours.<ref name=\"HK-75years\" />\n\n=== 21st century ===\n==== Centre for Christian Meditation and Spirituality ====\n{{main|Centre for Christian Meditation and Spirituality of the Diocese of Limburg}}\nAt 1. August 2007 the diocese of Limburg intended the church on instruction of former bishop [[Franz Kamphaus]] to the ''[[Centre for Christian Meditation and Spirituality of the Diocese of Limburg|Centre for Christian Meditation and Spirituality]]''. The centre is a pastoral institution of the diocese<ref name=\"StJosef-Frankfurt-MeditationChurch\" /> and is subordinated to the head of department of episcopalian chair (Prof. Dr. Hildegard Wustmans).<ref name=\"Bistum Limburg-Pastorale Dienste-Wustmanns\" /> In the center [[church service]]s, [[meditation]] courses, [[contemplation|contemplative]] prayer, [[Zen]]-meditation courses, days of reflection, [[Spiritual Exercises of Ignatius of Loyola|spiritual exercises]], [[Retreat (spiritual)|retreats]], and other meetings are offered. The Padre [[Helmut Schlegel]] of the [[Franciscan]]<ref name=\"hr-Helmut_Schlegel\" /> takes the responsibility for the offers as director/conductor of the center until July 2018 and as a priestly employee until June 2019. In November 2018 the theologian Samuel Stricker took over the leadership of the meditation center and in August 2019 Olaf Lindenberg the role as a priestly employee.<ref name=\"HK-Team\" /> The team includes colleagues like for example from the ''Medical Missionary Sisters'' (MMS).<ref name=\"MMS-Frankfurt\" /> Although the offerings of the centre are affected by [[Christianity]] the target audience includes humans of all [[Religious denomination]]s, [[world view]]s and [[culture]]s. The team<ref name=\"HK-Team\" /> publishes regularly a program.<ref name=\"HK-Program\" /> It was the first institution of its kind in [[Germany]]. The ''Holy Cross Church'' is one of five profile churches of the Diocese of Limburg. Furthermore, there are besides the ''Centre for Mourning Counselling'' (German:''Zentrum f\u00fcr Trauerseelsorge'') in ''St.Michael'' in [[Nordend (Frankfurt am Main)|Frankfurt-Nordend]] as well founded in 2007 also the three youth churches (German: Jugendkirchen) ''Crossover'' in ''St. Hildegard'' in [[Limburg an der Lahn]], ''Jona'' in ''St. Bonifatius'' in [[Sachsenhausen (Frankfurt am Main)|Frankfurt-Sachsenhausen]] and ''Kana'' in ''Maria-Hilf'' in [[Wiesbaden-Nordost]] which were founded already in 2005.\n\nIn the church, small changes were gradually implemented by 2010. The previous church benches have been replaced by folding chairs, which allow a more flexible use of the available space. The present main altar is no longer used for the church services of the centre for meditation and has been replaced by a small [[wood]]en altar, which forms a circle with the [[folding chair]]s. [[Stairlift]]s or [[wheelchair]] ramps have been installed for [[Accessibility|barrier-free]] access to the church interior or other premises. The crypt and the rooms of the former [[Clergy house|parsonage]] were redesigned for the use as a meditation center.\n\n==== From the new parish of St. Josef to the parish of a new type ====\nWith the establishment of the ''Center for Christian Meditation and Christian Spirituality'', the ''Holy Cross Church'' lost its previous role as a [[parish church]]. Thus, the former municipal territory of the ''Holy Cross parish'' belonged again to the parish of ''St. Josef'' from which the parish once emanated.\n\nThe two Catholic Bornheim congregations, with a part of the parish territory of the previous parish of ''St. Michael'', were united to form the new parish of ''St. Josef''. The Church of ''St. Michael'' in [[Nordend (Frankfurt am Main)|Frankfurt-Nordend]] became the ''Zentrum f\u00fcr Trauerseelsorge'' (=''Centre for Mourning Counselling'') of the Diocese of Limburg. The parish of ''St. Josef'' in Bornheim and the neighbouring parish of ''[[Maria Rosenkranz, Frankfurt|Maria Rosenkranz]]'' (=''[[Mary, mother of Jesus|Mary]] [[Rosary]]'') in Frankfurt-Seckbach formed the common pastoral area Frankfurt-Bornheim. Together with their neighbours ''Maria Rosenkranz'' in [[Seckbach (Frankfurt am Main)|Frankfurt-Seckbach]], the new ''St. Josef'' parishioners formed the pastoral area Frankfurt-Bornheim until 31 December 2011, in which a stronger cooperation than before took place. The parish of ''St. Josef'' was at this time with almost 11,000 Catholics one of the largest in the Diocese of Limburg. On 1 January 2012 the pastoral rooms in Frankfurt were reorganized and from the two pastoral areas of Frankfurt-Bornheim with the parishes of ''St. Josef-Bornheim'' and ''Maria Rosenkranz'' in Seckbach and Frankfurt-Ost with the two parishes of ''Heilig-Geist'' (=''[[Holy Spirit]]''in [[Riederwald|Frankfurt-Riederwald]] and ''Herz-Jesu'' (=''[[Sacred Heart|Heart of Jesus]]'') in [[Fechenheim|Frankfurt-Fechenheim]], a new pastoral area called ''Frankfurt-Ost'' was created. It existed until 31 December 2014.\n\nOn 1 January 2015, a parish of the new type under the name of ''St. Josef Frankfurt am Main'' was founded from the four parishes of the pastoral area ''Frankfurt-Ost'' ''St. Josef'' in Bornheim, ''Maria Rosenkranz'' in Seckbach, ''Heilig-Geist'' in Riederwald and ''Herz-Jesu'' in Fechenheim with the church places of ''Sankt Josef Bornheim'', ''Maria Rosenkranz Seckbach'', ''Heilig-Geist Riederwald'' and ''Herz-Jesu Fechenheim''. This includes the centralization of certain tasks, such as the parish secretariat.<ref name=\"Ffm-Ost-Pfarrei-NeuerTyp\" /><ref name=\"SJ-Ffm-Durchblick\" /> The parish now has about 16,500 members.<ref name=\"SJ-FFM-WEB-2015\" /> By its location in the parish of the new parish of ''St. Josef Frankfurt am Main'', it is also their branch church. The buildings are managed by the Stadtkirche Frankfurt am Main.\n\n== Building ==\nThe church building, which is equipped with flat [[saddle roof]]s and executed in a [[Steel frame|steel skeleton]] construction, is entered via the large [[Perron (staircase)|perron]], which is located in the ''Wittelsbacher Allee''. The church room is one floor above the street level. Martin Weber understood the ground plan of the church as a further development of the floor plan of the church ''St. Bonifatius'' in Frankfurt-Sachsenhausen.\n\nThe [[nave]] is oriented exactly north-south, the [[chancel]] is on the north side. After their inauguration, the interior was first painted red-pink plaid. The original windows bore large letters inside. It was a German translation of the [[Latin]] [[hymn]] [[Vexilla Regis]] (''The banners of the king issue forth''). The letters appeared dark in the day before the light shining from the outside through the windows. In the night they shone through the reflection of the light of the church illumination. The tower crosses are figured in the [[ratio]] of width to height 1:4 (1.50 \u00d7 6.00 meters). This is typical for crossed designed by Martin Weber (German: ''Weberkreuz'').\n\nIn the church ''St. Bonifatius'' in Frankfurt-Sachsenhausen, the altar is located in its own chancel, and the church ''Heilig-Geist'' in Frankfurt-Riederwald has in contrast to this a centrally located chancel.\n\nIn the Second World War the church and the adjoining parsonage in the ''Kettelerallee'' were damaged by several bomb hits. The church windows were destroyed in 1943 by the blast waves of bomb explosions nearby. The large main staircase at the tower was destroyed in 1944 by a bomb hit and the church roof of [[Incendiary device|fire bombs]]. After rebuilding, the church interior from 1951 got a white coating on the walls with an orange-coloured ceiling. The new church windows were re-glazed in a yellowish hue. The two side altars were removed. In addition, there were a total of five side chapels in the church between the pillars in the inner church and the two side walls of the church ship. They were dedicated to various saints, such as [[Elizabeth of Hungary|Saint Elizabeth]], [[Rita of Cascia|Saint Rita]] and [[Agnes of Assisi|Saint Agnes]]. Behind the left front pillar was the entrance to the [[pulpit]], which had a rectangular [[sounding board]]. The church was put under [[cultural heritage management]] in 1986 together with its location and the assignment to the Ernst May settlement around the church. In 1990 extensive renovations were begun, in which the altar area was redesigned and the interior was restored to its original color in 1992, also for reasons of cultural heritage management.\n\nThe church has a three-voice peal of [[bell]]s. In 1955, the choir of the then newly built Protestant ''Heilandskirche'' [=''Church of the Savior'') was adapted to that of the ''Holy Cross Church'' and the ''Johanniskirche'' (=''St. John's Church''), so that all three peal of bells could sound together without disharmony.\n\nUnder the church is the [[crypt]], which was subjected to a major renovation and transformation to a [[meditation]] room because of the founding of the ''Center for Christian Meditation and Spirituality''. Among other things, the floor was provided with a [[parquetry]] and the actual meditation area was provided with panels of [[linen]] and a door frame made of wood as an access. On the south wall of the crypt is a wooden [[crucifix]] with a size of 183 x 138&nbsp;cm. Presumably it originates originally from the [[Alps]] of the 17th or 18th century. It comes from the [[Nachlass]] of the wife May of the [[Jews|Jewish]] entrepreneur Carl von Weinberg. She died in 1937, and knew the first parish priest of ''Holy Cross'' Georg Nilges from his time as a [[chaplain]] in [[Niederrad|Frankfurt-Niederrad]].<ref name=\"MayvonWeinberg\" />\n\nNext to the crypt is a large auditorium with a stage, the parish hall of the former ''Holy Cross parish''. In the foot of the [[steeple|tower building]], which consists of seven floors, there is also the tower hall (German: Turmsaal), which is still used by the new parish of ''St. Josef Frankfurt am Main''. On the outer walls of the side aisles, the inside of the left front partition of the left side aisle to the church room and the rear wall of the [[Vestibule (architecture)|entrance hall]] in the tower building is a painted [[Stations of the Cross]] of the artist Georg Poppe. The penultimate (13th) station of the Stations of the Cross is the [[Piet\u00e0]] made of [[wood]] by the sculptor Arnold Hensler, also in the entrance hall.<ref name=\"HK-Kreuzweg\" /> On the altar side is a large cross renovated during the reconstruction in 1952, on which there is a painting with the rising [[Jesus]]. Until the Second World War there were two large painted [[angel]]s on the left and right of the cross on the wall.\n\nAt the southern external wall of the steeple ends the bell chair basic bar in four winged animal figures with the heads of a [[human]], a [[lion]], a [[bull]] and an [[eagle]]. They symbolize the four [[Four Evangelists|evangelist]]s [[Saint Matthew|Matthew]], [[Mark the Evangelist|Mark]], [[Luke the Evangelist|Luke]] and [[John the Evangelist|John]]. On the four [[girder]]s is an inscription with a text from the [[First Epistle to the Corinthians]] (1 Corinthians 1, 23\u201324): ''Wir aber predigen Christus den Gekreuzigten, Christus Kraft und Gottes Weisheit'' (=''But we preach Christ crucified, Christ the power of God, and the wisdom of God''). Below the four animal figures is a [[plaster]] [[relief]] of the [[Veil of Veronica]].<ref name=\"HK-Gille\" /> The relief was created by the sculptor Arnold Hensler from [[Wiesbaden]]. At the western and the eastern side of the bell steeple are each with a [[turret clock]] without cyphers. On property are in addition the 1957 established [[kindergarten]], a parsonage building with a parish office and dwellings, a building with group and club areas, as well as a football pitch used by young people. The parish kindergarten of St. Josef was expanded in 2011 by another building in the former parish court on Ortenberger Stra\u00dfe.\n\n== Organ ==\nIn 1964 the organ building company ''Gebr. Sp\u00e4th Orgelbau'' installed a typical [[pipe organ]] for this time. The [[tracker action]] works electrically, the [[organ stop]] loops are electro-pneumatically controlled. The organ was cleaned and overhauled in 2019 by the successor companies ''Freiburger Orgelbau Hartwig und Tilmann Sp\u00e4th''. The freestanding [[organ console]] was completely redesigned and equipped with new organ stop rockers and LED lighting fixtures. The electrics were partially renewed, as well as the leather of the [[bellows]], the membranes and other electro-pneumatic parts. The wind chests were overhauled and the wind supply stabilised by new bellows controls and a new motor. On the tonal level, the post-voicing gave the organ more character and softened loud sharpness. After the reconstruction and reversion, the Pommer 16' sounded as the supporting drone.<ref name=\"FreiburgerOrgelbau-Orgel-HK\" /><ref name=\"FreiburgerOrgelbau-Orgel-HK-Projektinfo\" />\n{| class=\"toptextcells\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"10\"\n|\n{|\n|colspan=\"3\"| '''I.

Also not far away is the motorway exit ''Frankfurt-Ost'' of the Federal Motorway 661 (German: [[Bundesautobahn 661]]).\n\n== Camino de Santiago ==\nBeneath the ''Bornheimer Hang'' at the eastern side of the church a branch of the German ''Camino de Santiago'' (Way of St. James) runs along.<ref name=\"Camino-RMV-map\" /> The route is based on the ancient trade route from [[Leipzig]] to Frankfurt am Main (''Des Reiches Stra\u00dfe'').<ref name=\"Camino-RMV-website\" /> The way starts in the bishop city [[Fulda]] and leads through [[Schl\u00fcchtern]], [[Steinau an der Stra\u00dfe]], [[Bad Soden-Salm\u00fcnster]], [[Gelnhausen]], [[Langenselbold]], [[Erlensee]] and [[Bruchk\u00f6bel]]. It belongs to the net of main routes of the [[pilgrim]] of [[James, son of Zebedee|St. James]] in [[Europe]] which are leading to the grave of the [[saint]] in the [[Cathedral of Santiago de Compostela|cathedral]] of [[Santiago de Compostela]]. This branch which is 116&nbsp;km long passes the Holy-Cross-Church and leads through the Ostpark and then passes the [[Seat of the European Central Bank]] at the former ''[[Gro\u00dfmarkthalle]]'' (''Wholesale Market Hall'') on its route to the [[Main (river)|Main river]] and the [[Innenstadt (Frankfurt am Main)|inner city]] of Frankfurt am Main. It passes also the ''[[Eiserner Steg]]'' (a footbridge made of iron) and leads further to [[Mainz]] and afterwards to [[Trier]].\n\n== Trivia ==\n=== Novel ===\nA Frankfurt-based scene of the 1999 [[novel]] ''Die T\u00fcrkin'' (=''The Turk'') of the German writer [[Martin Mosebach]], awarded with the [[Heimito von Doderer-Literaturpreis]], was inspired by the ''Holy Cross Church''. The described scenery around the \"[[Giorgio de Chirico|chiricoesque]] [[basilica]]\" resembles the ''Holy Cross Church'' on the ''Bornheimer Hang''.<ref name=\"HK-Mosebach-T\u00fcrkin\" />\n\n=== Television film ===\nAt the end of June 2019, a [[Confession (religion)|confession]] different scenes for the [[Sat.1]]-[[television film]] ''M\u00f6rderische Tage \u2013 Julia Durant ermittelt'' (=''Murderous days \u2013 Julia Durant investigates'') in the Julia Durant series by Andreas Franz and Daniel Holbe with actress Sandra Borgmann in the title role was shot by the director Nicolai Rohde in the Holy Cross Church as a [[Set construction|film set]]. The script was written by Kai-Uwe Hasenheit and Andreas Bareiss. For the shooting, chairs with black seats and backrests were set up inside the church by the film crew, as well as a custom-made [[confessional]], which incorporates design elements and colour schemes from church doors.<ref name=\"HK-FNP-13072019\" /><ref name=\"Bistum Limburg-HK-Dreharbeiten\"  /> Inside it can be seenn for example the wall painting of a grave scene in the entrance area, the pipe organ and the confessional as a film setting. Several times the perron and the houses of the settlement at Bornheimer Hang in opposite in the Ortenberger Street can be seen. In addition, drone images of the tower building were used. The television film was first broadcast on 10 November 2019 on [[Sat.1 Emotions|Sat.1 emotions]] and on 11 November 2019 on Sat.1.<ref name=\"Sat.1-M\u00f6rderische Tage\" />\n\n== Further reading==\n* Kath.

The [[Church (building)|church]] is an unusual example of [[interwar]] modernism as [[sacred architecture|sacred]] [[Bauhaus#Architectural output|Bauhaus architecture]].\n\nThe church was finally completed on 25 August 1929 and handed to the Catholic congregation of Bornheim. It was damaged in the [[World War II|Second World War]], and afterwards rebuilt with money donated for this purpose.\n\nIt is branch church of the parish St. Josef and is part of the [[Diocese of Limburg]]. The diocese dedicated it from 1 August 2007 as the location of a ''[[Centre for Christian Meditation and Spirituality of the Diocese of Limburg|Centre for Christian Meditation and Spirituality]]''.<ref name=\"StJosef-Frankfurt-MeditationChurch\" /> The centre was directed from August 2007 until July 2018 by the Franciscan [[Helmut Schlegel]] [[Order of Friars Minor|OFM]],<ref name=\"hr-Helmut_Schlegel\" /> where he worked until June 2019 as a retreat and meditation leader and priestly co-worker. Since November 2018 the centre is directed by the theologian Samuel Stricker,<ref name=\"HK-Team\" /> who works with a team of contributors, for example from the order of Medical Missionary Sisters (MMS).<ref name=\"MMS-Frankfurt\" />\n\nSince the beginning of the restoration of the interior of [[St. Leonhard, Frankfurt|St. Leonhard]] in [[Altstadt (Frankfurt am Main)|Frankfurt-Altstadt]], the services of the local ''St. Leonhard's International English-Speaking Catholic Parish'' have been held in the Holy Cross Church since 7 May 2011.<ref name=\"English-Parish-Ffm\" /> This remains the home of the Holy Cross Church even after the end of the work.<ref name=\"Leonhard-FNP-13082019\" />\n\n== History ==\n=== 20th century ===\n==== Foundation ====\n[[File:Martin-Weber-Platz.jpg|thumb|Steeple]]\n[[File:Heilig Kreuz Figuren Sued-West 15032011.JPG|thumb|Four figures at the south side of the steeple, symmbolizing the Evangelists]]\n[[File:Bornheimer Hang Westen HK-Kirche 15032011.JPG|thumb|View from the east]]\n[[File:Heilig Kreuz Nordseite 25062010.JPG|thumb|North side of the nave]]\n[[File:Heilig Kreuz Innenraum 11112012.JPG|thumb|Interior, fifth anniversary of the Centre on 11 November 2012]]\n[[File:Thomas L\u00f6hr Heilig-Kreuz Frankfurt Bornheim 11112012.JPG|thumb|Dr. Thomas L\u00f6hr, Auxiliary bishop of Limburg, in 2012 during the fifth anniversary]]\n[[File:Heilig Kreuz Schweisstuch 20092009.JPG|thumb|[[Veil of Veronica]] at the southern wall of the steeple]]\n[[File:Heilig Kreuz Pieta 25062010.JPG|thumb|[[Piet\u00e0]] by Arnold Hensler in the entrance hall]]\n[[File:Heilig-Kreuz-Gedenktafel 21022009.JPG|thumb|[[Commemorative plaque]] inside the church]]\n[[File:Heilig Kreuz Orgel 17042019.JPG|thumb|The organ on the gallery]]\n[[File:Heilig Kreuz Kerzenlabyrinth 11122011.JPG|thumb|[[Advent]]-[[Labyrinth]] made with 2500 burning tealights the Saturday before [[Gaudete Sunday]] in 2011]]\n[[File:HK Advents-Labyrinth 14122013 100sec.ogg|thumb|thumbtime=84|Creation and use of [[Advent]] labyrinth in 2013]]\n[[File:Heilig Kreuz Weihnachtskrippe 25122012.JPG|thumb|[[Nativity scene]] in 2011 with crib by Arnold Hensler]]\n[[File:Heilig Kreuz Holzkreuz MvW 02092011.JPG|thumb|Wooden cruzifix in the crypt]]\nThe Holy Cross church was built in 1929 from the master of church building Martin Weber and is at the edge of the housing development at the ''Bornheimer Hang''. Martin Weber built also the churches ''St. Bonifatius'' in [[Sachsenhausen (Frankfurt am Main)|Frankfurt-Sachsenhausen]] in 1927 and [[Heilig Geist, Frankfurt|Heilig-Geist]] in [[Riederwald|Frankfurt-Riederwald]] in 1931. The planned community center at the end of the ''Wittelsbacher Allee'' was not built so there was enough space for building the new church. The Holy Cross Church was the second catholic church in Frankfurt-Bornheim. The [[Parish (Catholic Church)|parish]] was an outsourcing of the later neighbour fold ''St. Josef'', the first catholic church in Bornheim. Reason was the expansion of the quarter Bornheim eastward at the ''Bornheimer Hang'' with the new settlement of the town planner Ernst May who built many new apartment buildings. This caused a growing number of Catholics who were living in the quarter. On 3 August 1927 a jury decided in a competition for the draft with the name slope crown from the master of church building Martin Weber (1890-1941). The three other participators of the competition were Hans (1872\u20131952) and Christoph Rummel (1881\u20131961) (Frankfurt), Richard Steidle (1881-1958) ([[Munich]]) and Robert B. Witte ([[Dresden]]). There were several specifications for the architects like for example the front of the [[Steeple (architecture)|steeple]] at the ''Wittelsbacher Allee'', between 700 and 800 seats, a high altar and two side altars and an organ loft for 150 people. The building model was called by Martin Weber slope crown, since the church should crown the ''Bornheimer Hang'' (slope). On 19 February 1928 the construction work began with the first cut of the spade. The 18. March 1928 was the day of the laying of the foundation stone. The topping-out ceremony was celebrated on 14 September 1928. On 25 August 1929 the church was inaugurated by Ludwig Maria Hugo, the Bishop of the [[Diocese of Mainz]].<ref name=\"HK-Gille\" /> The name was selected, since medieval Frankfurt possessed several the [[Christian cross|holy cross]] dedicated places. One of it was the chapel of the hospital to the holy cross which was donated in 1343 by Wicker Frosch. It formed with the chapel of the cloister of ''St. Katharinen'' which was built in 1354 a small double church, the predecessor building of the today's Evangelical-Lutheran ''Katharinen church''.<ref name=\"HK-50years\" /> Until 1950 were the ''Holy Cross'' parish financially still a part of the ''St. Josef'' parish with which it has a common church executive committee.\n\n==== Second World War ====\nIn the time starting from 1933 also the ''Holy Cross'' parish was under suppression by the [[Nazism|National Socialists]] (\"Nazis\") and from 1939 has also lost fold members in the [[World War II|Second World War]]. The church was used because of its exposed position as a point of reference for the navigation of the [[bomber]]s of the [[United States Army Air Forces|USAAF]] and the [[Royal Air Force|RAF]]. The windows at the west side of the church were destroyed on 4 October 1943 by parts of an attack, which should meet the water works near the cemetery of Bornheim. During the first large-scale attack on Frankfurt in the evening of the same day also the windows of the eastern side and the parsonage building were destroyed by a [[bomb]] row, which came down in the garden plots at the ''Bornheimer Hang''. With the next large attack on the city on 29 January 1944 parsonage building was heavily met. At the night from the 18. to the 19. March 1944 the church was hit by several [[Incendiary device|incendiary bombs]], which pierced the roof timberwork. The bombs could extinguished inside the church. On 11 December 1944 the church was hit by three bombs, which tore the large outside staircase at the west side of the steeple and the auxiliary [[chapel]] in the steeple hall. Now a large hole was into the west side of the nave. The services had to be held thereafter in the heating plant room underneath the steeple.<ref name=\"HK-30years\" />\n\n==== Post-war period ====\nThe heating plant room underneath the steeple was used until 1. July 1946 as church. During the time of the reconstruction starting from 26 September 1948 the parish hall which is under the church was used as a church beneath the church. In 1950 ''Holy Cross'' became its own parish with its own church executive committee.<ref name=\"HK-30years\" /> 1951 the order for the re-establishment of the church could be given. 1952 the inside of the church were restored. The church windows were glazed new by the glass painter Lorenz Matheis with [[Stained glass|stained glass window]] in white and golden yellow colours. The walls and the ceiling were painted in a single-coloured finish. 1957 the [[kindergarten]] in the west of the church was built. In 1965 a stage for events was built in the parish hall under the church ship during a renovation. In 1968 the [[altar]] area was transformed, a consequence of the liturgy reformation by the [[Second Vatican Council]]. The altar was shifted, so that the priest could celebrate the service turned to the fold. A stone lectern replaced the torn off pulpit. The old altar under the great wall-cross in the chancel was replaced by the baptismal font. The ceiling got an orange and the walls a light-beige paint. In 1969 the first election of the parish council took place. In 1975 the board of directors elected by the parish council replaced the church executive committee. In 1990 a further transformation of the altar was executed. The [[baptism]]al font now was located in the entrance hall of the church. It was replaced by a sacramental altar at the place of the old high altar was built and the [[Church tabernacle|tabernacle]] was placed on it. Starting from 1991 the minister of the fold was also simultaneous ministers of the parish ''[[Maria Rosenkranz, Frankfurt|Maria-Rosenkranz]]'' (=[[Mary, mother of Jesus|Mary]] [[Rosary]]) in [[Frankfurt]]-[[Seckbach (Frankfurt am Main)|Seckbach]]. 1992 the church interior was restored to the original condition with the walls in a [[checkerboard]] pattern in light and dark red colours.<ref name=\"HK-75years\" />\n\n=== 21st century ===\n==== Centre for Christian Meditation and Spirituality ====\n{{main|Centre for Christian Meditation and Spirituality of the Diocese of Limburg}}\nAt 1. August 2007 the diocese of Limburg intended the church on instruction of former bishop [[Franz Kamphaus]] to the ''[[Centre for Christian Meditation and Spirituality of the Diocese of Limburg|Centre for Christian Meditation and Spirituality]]''. The centre is a pastoral institution of the diocese<ref name=\"StJosef-Frankfurt-MeditationChurch\" /> and is subordinated to the head of department of episcopalian chair (Prof. Dr. Hildegard Wustmans).<ref name=\"Bistum Limburg-Pastorale Dienste-Wustmanns\" /> In the center [[church service]]s, [[meditation]] courses, [[contemplation|contemplative]] prayer, [[Zen]]-meditation courses, days of reflection, [[Spiritual Exercises of Ignatius of Loyola|spiritual exercises]], [[Retreat (spiritual)|retreats]], and other meetings are offered. The Padre [[Helmut Schlegel]] of the [[Franciscan]]<ref name=\"hr-Helmut_Schlegel\" /> takes the responsibility for the offers as director/conductor of the center until July 2018 and as a priestly employee until June 2019. In November 2018 the theologian Samuel Stricker took over the leadership of the meditation center and in August 2019 Olaf Lindenberg the role as a priestly employee.<ref name=\"HK-Team\" /> The team includes colleagues like for example from the ''Medical Missionary Sisters'' (MMS).<ref name=\"MMS-Frankfurt\" /> Although the offerings of the centre are affected by [[Christianity]] the target audience includes humans of all [[Religious denomination]]s, [[world view]]s and [[culture]]s. The team<ref name=\"HK-Team\" /> publishes regularly a program.<ref name=\"HK-Program\" /> It was the first institution of its kind in [[Germany]]. The ''Holy Cross Church'' is one of five profile churches of the Diocese of Limburg. Furthermore, there are besides the ''Centre for Mourning Counselling'' (German:''Zentrum f\u00fcr Trauerseelsorge'') in ''St.Michael'' in [[Nordend (Frankfurt am Main)|Frankfurt-Nordend]] as well founded in 2007 also the three youth churches (German: Jugendkirchen) ''Crossover'' in ''St. Hildegard'' in [[Limburg an der Lahn]], ''Jona'' in ''St. Bonifatius'' in [[Sachsenhausen (Frankfurt am Main)|Frankfurt-Sachsenhausen]] and ''Kana'' in ''Maria-Hilf'' in [[Wiesbaden-Nordost]] which were founded already in 2005.\n\nIn the church, small changes were gradually implemented by 2010. The previous church benches have been replaced by folding chairs, which allow a more flexible use of the available space. The present main altar is no longer used for the church services of the centre for meditation and has been replaced by a small [[wood]]en altar, which forms a circle with the [[folding chair]]s. [[Stairlift]]s or [[wheelchair]] ramps have been installed for [[Accessibility|barrier-free]] access to the church interior or other premises. The crypt and the rooms of the former [[Clergy house|parsonage]] were redesigned for the use as a meditation center.\n\n==== From the new parish of St. Josef to the parish of a new type ====\nWith the establishment of the ''Center for Christian Meditation and Christian Spirituality'', the ''Holy Cross Church'' lost its previous role as a [[parish church]]. Thus, the former municipal territory of the ''Holy Cross parish'' belonged again to the parish of ''St. Josef'' from which the parish once emanated.\n\nThe two Catholic Bornheim congregations, with a part of the parish territory of the previous parish of ''St. Michael'', were united to form the new parish of ''St. Josef''. The Church of ''St. Michael'' in [[Nordend (Frankfurt am Main)|Frankfurt-Nordend]] became the ''Zentrum f\u00fcr Trauerseelsorge'' (=''Centre for Mourning Counselling'') of the Diocese of Limburg. The parish of ''St. Josef'' in Bornheim and the neighbouring parish of ''[[Maria Rosenkranz, Frankfurt|Maria Rosenkranz]]'' (=''[[Mary, mother of Jesus|Mary]] [[Rosary]]'') in Frankfurt-Seckbach formed the common pastoral area Frankfurt-Bornheim. Together with their neighbours ''Maria Rosenkranz'' in [[Seckbach (Frankfurt am Main)|Frankfurt-Seckbach]], the new ''St. Josef'' parishioners formed the pastoral area Frankfurt-Bornheim until 31 December 2011, in which a stronger cooperation than before took place. The parish of ''St. Josef'' was at this time with almost 11,000 Catholics one of the largest in the Diocese of Limburg. On 1 January 2012 the pastoral rooms in Frankfurt were reorganized and from the two pastoral areas of Frankfurt-Bornheim with the parishes of ''St. Josef-Bornheim'' and ''Maria Rosenkranz'' in Seckbach and Frankfurt-Ost with the two parishes of ''Heilig-Geist'' (=''[[Holy Spirit]]''in [[Riederwald|Frankfurt-Riederwald]] and ''Herz-Jesu'' (=''[[Sacred Heart|Heart of Jesus]]'') in [[Fechenheim|Frankfurt-Fechenheim]], a new pastoral area called ''Frankfurt-Ost'' was created. It existed until 31 December 2014.\n\nOn 1 January 2015, a parish of the new type under the name of ''St. Josef Frankfurt am Main'' was founded from the four parishes of the pastoral area ''Frankfurt-Ost'' ''St. Josef'' in Bornheim, ''Maria Rosenkranz'' in Seckbach, ''Heilig-Geist'' in Riederwald and ''Herz-Jesu'' in Fechenheim with the church places of ''Sankt Josef Bornheim'', ''Maria Rosenkranz Seckbach'', ''Heilig-Geist Riederwald'' and ''Herz-Jesu Fechenheim''. This includes the centralization of certain tasks, such as the parish secretariat.<ref name=\"Ffm-Ost-Pfarrei-NeuerTyp\" /><ref name=\"SJ-Ffm-Durchblick\" /> The parish now has about 16,500 members.<ref name=\"SJ-FFM-WEB-2015\" /> By its location in the parish of the new parish of ''St. Josef Frankfurt am Main'', it is also their branch church. The buildings are managed by the Stadtkirche Frankfurt am Main.\n\n== Building ==\nThe church building, which is equipped with flat [[saddle roof]]s and executed in a [[Steel frame|steel skeleton]] construction, is entered via the large [[Perron (staircase)|perron]], which is located in the ''Wittelsbacher Allee''. The church room is one floor above the street level. Martin Weber understood the ground plan of the church as a further development of the floor plan of the church ''St. Bonifatius'' in Frankfurt-Sachsenhausen.\n\nThe [[nave]] is oriented exactly north-south, the [[chancel]] is on the north side. After their inauguration, the interior was first painted red-pink plaid. The original windows bore large letters inside. It was a German translation of the [[Latin]] [[hymn]] [[Vexilla Regis]] (''The banners of the king issue forth''). The letters appeared dark in the day before the light shining from the outside through the windows. In the night they shone through the reflection of the light of the church illumination. The tower crosses are figured in the [[ratio]] of width to height 1:4 (1.50 \u00d7 6.00 meters). This is typical for crossed designed by Martin Weber (German: ''Weberkreuz'').\n\nIn the church ''St. Bonifatius'' in Frankfurt-Sachsenhausen, the altar is located in its own chancel, and the church ''Heilig-Geist'' in Frankfurt-Riederwald has in contrast to this a centrally located chancel.\n\nIn the Second World War the church and the adjoining parsonage in the ''Kettelerallee'' were damaged by several bomb hits. The church windows were destroyed in 1943 by the blast waves of bomb explosions nearby. The large main staircase at the tower was destroyed in 1944 by a bomb hit and the church roof of [[Incendiary device|fire bombs]]. After rebuilding, the church interior from 1951 got a white coating on the walls with an orange-coloured ceiling. The new church windows were re-glazed in a yellowish hue. The two side altars were removed. In addition, there were a total of five side chapels in the church between the pillars in the inner church and the two side walls of the church ship. They were dedicated to various saints, such as [[Elizabeth of Hungary|Saint Elizabeth]], [[Rita of Cascia|Saint Rita]] and [[Agnes of Assisi|Saint Agnes]]. Behind the left front pillar was the entrance to the [[pulpit]], which had a rectangular [[sounding board]]. The church was put under [[cultural heritage management]] in 1986 together with its location and the assignment to the Ernst May settlement around the church. In 1990 extensive renovations were begun, in which the altar area was redesigned and the interior was restored to its original color in 1992, also for reasons of cultural heritage management.\n\nThe church has a three-voice peal of [[bell]]s. In 1955, the choir of the then newly built Protestant ''Heilandskirche'' [=''Church of the Savior'') was adapted to that of the ''Holy Cross Church'' and the ''Johanniskirche'' (=''St. John's Church''), so that all three peal of bells could sound together without disharmony.\n\nUnder the church is the [[crypt]], which was subjected to a major renovation and transformation to a [[meditation]] room because of the founding of the ''Center for Christian Meditation and Spirituality''. Among other things, the floor was provided with a [[parquetry]] and the actual meditation area was provided with panels of [[linen]] and a door frame made of wood as an access. On the south wall of the crypt is a wooden [[crucifix]] with a size of 183 x 138&nbsp;cm. Presumably it originates originally from the [[Alps]] of the 17th or 18th century. It comes from the [[Nachlass]] of the wife May of the [[Jews|Jewish]] entrepreneur Carl von Weinberg. She died in 1937, and knew the first parish priest of ''Holy Cross'' Georg Nilges from his time as a [[chaplain]] in [[Niederrad|Frankfurt-Niederrad]].<ref name=\"MayvonWeinberg\" />\n\nNext to the crypt is a large auditorium with a stage, the parish hall of the former ''Holy Cross parish''. In the foot of the [[steeple|tower building]], which consists of seven floors, there is also the tower hall (German: Turmsaal), which is still used by the new parish of ''St. Josef Frankfurt am Main''. On the outer walls of the side aisles, the inside of the left front partition of the left side aisle to the church room and the rear wall of the [[Vestibule (architecture)|entrance hall]] in the tower building is a painted [[Stations of the Cross]] of the artist Georg Poppe. The penultimate (13th) station of the Stations of the Cross is the [[Piet\u00e0]] made of [[wood]] by the sculptor Arnold Hensler, also in the entrance hall.<ref name=\"HK-Kreuzweg\" /> On the altar side is a large cross renovated during the reconstruction in 1952, on which there is a painting with the rising [[Jesus]]. Until the Second World War there were two large painted [[angel]]s on the left and right of the cross on the wall.\n\nAt the southern external wall of the steeple ends the bell chair basic bar in four winged animal figures with the heads of a [[human]], a [[lion]], a [[bull]] and an [[eagle]]. They symbolize the four [[Four Evangelists|evangelist]]s [[Saint Matthew|Matthew]], [[Mark the Evangelist|Mark]], [[Luke the Evangelist|Luke]] and [[John the Evangelist|John]]. On the four [[girder]]s is an inscription with a text from the [[First Epistle to the Corinthians]] (1 Corinthians 1, 23\u201324): ''Wir aber predigen Christus den Gekreuzigten, Christus Kraft und Gottes Weisheit'' (=''But we preach Christ crucified, Christ the power of God, and the wisdom of God''). Below the four animal figures is a [[plaster]] [[relief]] of the [[Veil of Veronica]].<ref name=\"HK-Gille\" /> The relief was created by the sculptor Arnold Hensler from [[Wiesbaden]]. At the western and the eastern side of the bell steeple are each with a [[turret clock]] without cyphers. On property are in addition the 1957 established [[kindergarten]], a parsonage building with a parish office and dwellings, a building with group and club areas, as well as a football pitch used by young people. The parish kindergarten of St. Josef was expanded in 2011 by another building in the former parish court on Ortenberger Stra\u00dfe.\n\n== Organ ==\nIn 1964 the organ building company ''Gebr. Sp\u00e4th Orgelbau'' installed a typical [[pipe organ]] for this time. The [[tracker action]] works electrically, the [[organ stop]] loops are electro-pneumatically controlled. The organ was cleaned and overhauled in 2019 by the successor companies ''Freiburger Orgelbau Hartwig und Tilmann Sp\u00e4th''. The freestanding [[organ console]] was completely redesigned and equipped with new organ stop rockers and LED lighting fixtures. The electrics were partially renewed, as well as the leather of the [[bellows]], the membranes and other electro-pneumatic parts. The wind chests were overhauled and the wind supply stabilised by new bellows controls and a new motor. On the tonal level, the post-voicing gave the organ more character and softened loud sharpness. After the reconstruction and reversion, the Pommer 16' sounded as the supporting drone.<ref name=\"FreiburgerOrgelbau-Orgel-HK\" /><ref name=\"FreiburgerOrgelbau-Orgel-HK-Projektinfo\" />\n{| class=\"toptextcells\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"10\"\n|\n{|\n|colspan=\"3\"| '''I.

Also not far away is the motorway exit ''Frankfurt-Ost'' of the Federal Motorway 661 (German: [[Bundesautobahn 661]]).\n\n== Camino de Santiago ==\nBeneath the ''Bornheimer Hang'' at the eastern side of the church a branch of the German ''Camino de Santiago'' (Way of St. James) runs along.<ref name=\"Camino-RMV-map\" /> The route is based on the ancient trade route from [[Leipzig]] to Frankfurt am Main (''Des Reiches Stra\u00dfe'').<ref name=\"Camino-RMV-website\" /> The way starts in the bishop city [[Fulda]] and leads through [[Schl\u00fcchtern]], [[Steinau an der Stra\u00dfe]], [[Bad Soden-Salm\u00fcnster]], [[Gelnhausen]], [[Langenselbold]], [[Erlensee]] and [[Bruchk\u00f6bel]]. It belongs to the net of main routes of the [[pilgrim]] of [[James, son of Zebedee|St. James]] in [[Europe]] which are leading to the grave of the [[saint]] in the [[Cathedral of Santiago de Compostela|cathedral]] of [[Santiago de Compostela]]. This branch which is 116&nbsp;km long passes the Holy-Cross-Church and leads through the Ostpark and then passes the [[Seat of the European Central Bank]] at the former ''[[Gro\u00dfmarkthalle]]'' (''Wholesale Market Hall'') on its route to the [[Main (river)|Main river]] and the [[Innenstadt (Frankfurt am Main)|inner city]] of Frankfurt am Main. It passes also the ''[[Eiserner Steg]]'' (a footbridge made of iron) and leads further to [[Mainz]] and afterwards to [[Trier]].\n\n== Trivia ==\n=== Novel ===\nA Frankfurt-based scene of the 1999 [[novel]] ''Die T\u00fcrkin'' (=''The Turk'') of the German writer [[Martin Mosebach]], awarded with the [[Heimito von Doderer-Literaturpreis]], was inspired by the ''Holy Cross Church''. The described scenery around the \"[[Giorgio de Chirico|chiricoesque]] [[basilica]]\" resembles the ''Holy Cross Church'' on the ''Bornheimer Hang''.<ref name=\"HK-Mosebach-T\u00fcrkin\" />\n\n=== Television film ===\nAt the end of June 2019, a [[Confession (religion)|confession]] different scenes for the [[Sat.1]]-[[television film]] ''M\u00f6rderische Tage \u2013 Julia Durant ermittelt'' (=''Murderous days \u2013 Julia Durant investigates'') in the Julia Durant series by Andreas Franz and Daniel Holbe with actress Sandra Borgmann in the title role was shot by the director Nicolai Rohde in the Holy Cross Church as a [[Set construction|film set]]. The script was written by Kai-Uwe Hasenheit and Andreas Bareiss. For the shooting, chairs with black seats and backrests were set up inside the church by the film crew, as well as a custom-made [[confessional]], which incorporates design elements and colour schemes from church doors.<ref name=\"HK-FNP-13072019\" /><ref name=\"Bistum Limburg-HK-Dreharbeiten\"  /> Inside it can be seenn for example the wall painting of a grave scene in the entrance area, the pipe organ and the confessional as a film setting. Several times the perron and the houses of the settlement at Bornheimer Hang in opposite in the Ortenberger Street can be seen. In addition, drone images of the tower building were used. The television film was first broadcast on 10 November 2019 on [[Sat.1 Emotions|Sat.1 emotions]] and on 11 November 2019 on Sat.1.<ref name=\"Sat.1-M\u00f6rderische Tage\" />\n\n== Further reading==\n* Kath.

After [[Death of Joseph Smith|Smith's death]] in 1844, there was a [[Succession crisis (Latter Day Saints)|crisis of authority]], with the majority of the members following [[Brigham Young]] to [[Utah Territory]], but with several smaller denominations remaining in Illinois or settling in Missouri and in other states. Each of the churches that resulted from this [[Schism (religion)|schism]] considers itself to be the rightful continuation of Smith's original \"Church of Christ\", regardless of the name they may currently bear ([[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] <!-- \"LDS Church\" is in accordance with the Wikipedia Manual of Style, and disagreements should be addressed at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Manual_of_Style/Latter_Day_Saints. Any change made to \"LDS Church\" will be reverted. -->(LDS Church), [[Community of Christ]], [[The Church of Jesus Christ (Bickertonite)]], [[Church of Christ (Temple Lot)]], etc.).\n\nThis church is unrelated to other bodies bearing the same name, including the [[United Church of Christ]], a [[Reformed churches|Reformed]] church body, and the [[Churches of Christ]], an offshoot of the [[Restoration movement|Campbellite movement]]. Today, there are several Latter Day Saint churches called \"Church of Christ\", largely within the [[Hedrickite]] branch of the movement.\n\n==Doctrinal development prior to 1830==\nThe first Latter Day Saint references to the \"church of Christ\" are found in passages of the [[Book of Mormon]] that Smith dictated from April to June 1829. During the course of this dictation, the outlines for a community of believers or church structure gradually became apparent. Such a structure would have authority from God, ordinances such as [[Baptism (Latter Day Saints)|baptism]], and ordained [[Priesthood (Mormonism)|clergy]]. Some time in April 1829, Smith dictated a story of [[Alma the Elder]], the former priest of a wicked king, who baptized his followers by immersion, \"having authority from the Almighty God\", and called his community of believers the \"church of God, or the church of Christ\".<ref>{{sourcetext|source=Book of Mormon|book=Mosiah|chapter=18|verse=13|range=-17}}</ref> The book described the clergy in Alma's church as consisting of priests, who were unpaid and were to \"preach nothing save it were repentance and faith in the Lord\".<ref>{{sourcetext|source=Book of Mormon|book=Mosiah|chapter=18|verse=20}}</ref> Alma later established many churches (or congregations), which were considered \"one church\" because \"there was nothing preached in all the churches except it were repentance and faith in God.\"<ref>{{sourcetext|source=Book of Mormon|book=Mosiah|chapter=25|verse=22}}</ref> In addition to priests, the book mentions that the clergy of these churches also included teachers.<ref>{{sourcetext|source=Book of Mormon|book=Mosiah|chapter=25|verse=21}}</ref>\n\nNevertheless, in May 1829, a [[Revelation (Latter Day Saints)|revelation]] by Smith described the \"church\" in informal terms: \"Behold, this is my doctrine: whosoever repenteth and cometh unto me, the same is my church: whosoever declareth more or less than this, the same is not of me, but is against me: therefore, he is not of my church.\"<ref>[[Book of Commandments]] 9:16</ref> Smith's further dictation of the [[Book of Mormon]] also stated that there were \"two churches only; the one is the church of the Lamb of God, and the other is the church of the devil\".<ref>{{sourcetext|source=Book of Mormon|book=1 Nephi|chapter=14|verse=10}}</ref>\n\nAs a result of the book's references to baptism and the organization of churches, Smith prayed for clarification and direction. Soon thereafter, in May 1829, Smith and [[Oliver Cowdery]] said they were visited by [[John the Baptist]] in angelic form, who conferred the [[Aaronic priesthood (Latter Day Saints)|Aaronic priesthood]] on them, which included the authority to baptize in Jesus Christ's name. Smith and Cowdery then baptized each other by immersion. They also baptized dozens of people, as early as June 1829.<ref>Smith, ''[[History of the Church (Joseph Smith)|History of the Church]]'' 1:6, 59.</ref> These converts, however, did not belong to a formal church organization. Nevertheless, this community of believers referred to themselves as \"the Church of Christ\", and included converts in three New York towns: [[Fayette, New York|Fayette]], [[Manchester (town), New York|Manchester]], and [[Colesville, New York|Colesville]].\n\nIn June 1829, Smith dictated a revelation stating that \"in [the Book of Mormon] are all things written, concerning my church, my gospel, and my rock. Wherefore if you shall build up my church, and my gospel, and my rock, the gates of hell shall not prevail against you.\"<ref>[[Book of Commandments]] __:3\u20134.</ref> Some time between June and December 1829, Cowdery said he received a revelation about \"how he should build up his church & the manner thereof\". This revelation was called the \"[[Articles of the Church of Christ]]\", and it indicated that the church should ordain [[Priest (Latter Day Saints)|priests]] and [[Teacher (Latter Day Saints)|teachers]] \"according to the gifts & callings of God unto men\". The church was to meet regularly to partake of [[Sacrament (Mormonism)|bread and wine]]. Cowdery was described as \"an Apostle of Jesus Christ\". According to [[David Whitmer]], by April 1830, this informal \"Church of Christ\" had about six [[Elder (Latter Day Saints)|elders]] and 70 members.<ref name=\"Whitmer 1887 33\">{{Harv|Whitmer|1887|p=33}}</ref>\n\n==Organization of the church==\n{{See also|History of the Latter Day Saint movement#Organization of the Church of Christ}}\nOn April 6, 1830, [[Joseph Smith]], [[Oliver Cowdery]], and a group of approximately 30 believers met with the intention of formally organizing the Church of Christ into a legal institution. It is uncertain whether this occurred in the home of [[Peter Whitmer, Sr.]] in [[Fayette, New York]], or whether it occurred in the log home of [[Joseph Smith, Sr.]] near their property in [[Manchester (town), New York|Manchester]]. Soon after this formal organization, small [[Branch (Mormonism)|branches]] were formally established in Manchester, Fayette, and Colesville. Although the purpose was to effect a legal organization, it may have had no legal effect since no records of incorporation have been found in either the Manchester\u2013Palmyra area, the Fayette area, or in several other counties around this time period, as required by state law at the time: the church evidently did not follow the required legal formalities.<ref>{{Harvtxt|Marquardt|2005|pp=224\u201325}}.</ref>\n\n===Location of the organization===\nPrior to 1834, all church publications and documents stated that the church was organized in the Smith log home in Manchester, New York.<ref>{{Harvtxt|Marquardt|2005|pp=212\u2013219}}.</ref> The first Smith log home was located on the Samuel Jennings property in Palmyra, just north of the town's southern border and subsequent the Smith Manchester property.<ref>{{Harv|Berge|1985}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/history-maps/map-2?lang=eng|title=Church History Maps|website=ChurchofJesusChrist.org|access-date=2017-11-05}}</ref> The Smiths may have constructed a second log home on their own property.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://signaturebookslibrary.org/lucys-book-2/|title=Lucy's Book \u2013 02; note 76|last=|first=|date=|website=signaturebookslibrary.org|language=en-US|access-date=2017-11-05|quote=The Smith family first lived in a house on the west end of Main Street in Palmyra.

Because of the distinct belief in the [[Book of Mormon]] among Smith's followers, people outside the church began to refer them as \"Mormonites\" or \"[[Mormon (word)|Mormons]].\" Smith and other church elders considered the name \"Mormon\" derogatory.<ref>[http://contentdm.lib.byu.edu/cdm/ref/collection/NCMP1820-1846/id/5887 \"The Saints\"], ''[[Evening and Morning Star]]'', vol. 2, no. 20, pp. 158\u201359 (May 1834).</ref> In May 1834, the church adopted a resolution that the church would be known thereafter as \"The Church of the Latter Day Saints\".<ref name = 1834name/> At various times the church was also referred to as \"The Church of Jesus Christ\", \"The Church of God\",<ref name = othernames/> and \"The Church of Christ of Latter Day Saints\".<ref name = anderson/><ref name = black/>\n\nIn the late 1830s, Smith and those loyal to him founded a new headquarters in [[Far West, Missouri]].

The largest of these, led by [[Brigham Young]] and now based in [[Salt Lake City, Utah]], continued using \"Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints\" until incorporating in 1851, when the church standardized the spelling of its name as \"[[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]]\" (LDS Church).<ref>[http://www.jrcls.org/publications/perspectives/Lesson%20Plan%20re%20Law%20and%20Church%20as%20an%20Institution%20-%202.pdf Lesson: Law and the Church as an Institution].</ref> Followers of [[James J.

After [[Death of Joseph Smith|Smith's death]] in 1844, there was a [[Succession crisis (Latter Day Saints)|crisis of authority]], with the majority of the members following [[Brigham Young]] to [[Utah Territory]], but with several smaller denominations remaining in Illinois or settling in Missouri and in other states. Each of the churches that resulted from this [[Schism (religion)|schism]] considers itself to be the rightful continuation of Smith's original \"Church of Christ\", regardless of the name they may currently bear ([[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (LDS Church), [[Community of Christ]], [[The Church of Jesus Christ (Bickertonite)]], [[Church of Christ (Temple Lot)]], etc.).\n\nThis church is unrelated to other bodies bearing the same name, including the [[United Church of Christ]], a [[Reformed churches|Reformed]] church body, and the [[Churches of Christ]], an offshoot of the [[Restoration movement|Campbellite movement]]. Today, there are several Latter Day Saint churches called \"Church of Christ\", largely within the [[Hedrickite]] branch of the movement.\n\n==Doctrinal development prior to 1830==\nThe first Latter Day Saint references to the \"church of Christ\" are found in passages of the [[Book of Mormon]] that Smith dictated from April to June 1829. During the course of this dictation, the outlines for a community of believers or church structure gradually became apparent. Such a structure would have authority from God, ordinances such as [[Baptism (Latter Day Saints)|baptism]], and ordained [[Priesthood (Mormonism)|clergy]]. Some time in April 1829, Smith dictated a story of [[Alma the Elder]], the former priest of a wicked king, who baptized his followers by immersion, \"having authority from the Almighty God\", and called his community of believers the \"church of God, or the church of Christ\".<ref>{{sourcetext|source=Book of Mormon|book=Mosiah|chapter=18|verse=13|range=-17}}</ref> The book described the clergy in Alma's church as consisting of priests, who were unpaid and were to \"preach nothing save it were repentance and faith in the Lord\".<ref>{{sourcetext|source=Book of Mormon|book=Mosiah|chapter=18|verse=20}}</ref> Alma later established many churches (or congregations), which were considered \"one church\" because \"there was nothing preached in all the churches except it were repentance and faith in God.\"<ref>{{sourcetext|source=Book of Mormon|book=Mosiah|chapter=25|verse=22}}</ref> In addition to priests, the book mentions that the clergy of these churches also included teachers.<ref>{{sourcetext|source=Book of Mormon|book=Mosiah|chapter=25|verse=21}}</ref>\n\nNevertheless, in May 1829, a [[Revelation (Latter Day Saints)|revelation]] by Smith described the \"church\" in informal terms: \"Behold, this is my doctrine: whosoever repenteth and cometh unto me, the same is my church: whosoever declareth more or less than this, the same is not of me, but is against me: therefore, he is not of my church.\"<ref>[[Book of Commandments]] 9:16</ref> Smith's further dictation of the [[Book of Mormon]] also stated that there were \"two churches only; the one is the church of the Lamb of God, and the other is the church of the devil\".<ref>{{sourcetext|source=Book of Mormon|book=1 Nephi|chapter=14|verse=10}}</ref>\n\nAs a result of the book's references to baptism and the organization of churches, Smith prayed for clarification and direction. Soon thereafter, in May 1829, Smith and [[Oliver Cowdery]] said they were visited by [[John the Baptist]] in angelic form, who conferred the [[Aaronic priesthood (Latter Day Saints)|Aaronic priesthood]] on them, which included the authority to baptize in Jesus Christ's name. Smith and Cowdery then baptized each other by immersion. They also baptized dozens of people, as early as June 1829.<ref>Smith, ''[[History of the Church (Joseph Smith)|History of the Church]]'' 1:6, 59.</ref> These converts, however, did not belong to a formal church organization. Nevertheless, this community of believers referred to themselves as \"the Church of Christ\", and included converts in three New York towns: [[Fayette, New York|Fayette]], [[Manchester (town), New York|Manchester]], and [[Colesville, New York|Colesville]].\n\nIn June 1829, Smith dictated a revelation stating that \"in [the Book of Mormon] are all things written, concerning my church, my gospel, and my rock. Wherefore if you shall build up my church, and my gospel, and my rock, the gates of hell shall not prevail against you.\"<ref>[[Book of Commandments]] __:3\u20134.</ref> Some time between June and December 1829, Cowdery said he received a revelation about \"how he should build up his church & the manner thereof\". This revelation was called the \"[[Articles of the Church of Christ]]\", and it indicated that the church should ordain [[Priest (Latter Day Saints)|priests]] and [[Teacher (Latter Day Saints)|teachers]] \"according to the gifts & callings of God unto men\". The church was to meet regularly to partake of [[Sacrament (Mormonism)|bread and wine]]. Cowdery was described as \"an Apostle of Jesus Christ\". According to [[David Whitmer]], by April 1830, this informal \"Church of Christ\" had about six [[Elder (Latter Day Saints)|elders]] and 70 members.<ref name=\"Whitmer 1887 33\">{{Harv|Whitmer|1887|p=33}}</ref>\n\n==Organization of the church==\n{{See also|History of the Latter Day Saint movement#Organization of the Church of Christ}}\nOn April 6, 1830, [[Joseph Smith]], [[Oliver Cowdery]], and a group of approximately 30 believers met with the intention of formally organizing the Church of Christ into a legal institution. It is uncertain whether this occurred in the home of [[Peter Whitmer, Sr.]] in [[Fayette, New York]], or whether it occurred in the log home of [[Joseph Smith, Sr.]] near their property in [[Manchester (town), New York|Manchester]]. Soon after this formal organization, small [[Branch (Mormonism)|branches]] were formally established in Manchester, Fayette, and Colesville. Although the purpose was to effect a legal organization, it may have had no legal effect since no records of incorporation have been found in either the Manchester\u2013Palmyra area, the Fayette area, or in several other counties around this time period, as required by state law at the time: the church evidently did not follow the required legal formalities.<ref>{{Harvtxt|Marquardt|2005|pp=224\u201325}}.</ref>\n\n===Location of the organization===\nPrior to 1834, all church publications and documents stated that the church was organized in the Smith log home in Manchester, New York.<ref>{{Harvtxt|Marquardt|2005|pp=212\u2013219}}.</ref> The first Smith log home was located on the Samuel Jennings property in Palmyra, just north of the town's southern border and subsequent the Smith Manchester property.<ref>{{Harv|Berge|1985}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/history-maps/map-2?lang=eng|title=Church History Maps|website=ChurchofJesusChrist.org|access-date=2017-11-05}}</ref> The Smiths may have constructed a second log home on their own property.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://signaturebookslibrary.org/lucys-book-2/|title=Lucy's Book \u2013 02; note 76|last=|first=|date=|website=signaturebookslibrary.org|language=en-US|access-date=2017-11-05|quote=The Smith family first lived in a house on the west end of Main Street in Palmyra.

Because of the distinct belief in the [[Book of Mormon]] among Smith's followers, people outside the church began to refer them as \"Mormonites\" or \"[[Mormon (word)|Mormons]].\" Smith and other church elders considered the name \"Mormon\" derogatory.<ref>[http://contentdm.lib.byu.edu/cdm/ref/collection/NCMP1820-1846/id/5887 \"The Saints\"], ''[[Evening and Morning Star]]'', vol. 2, no. 20, pp. 158\u201359 (May 1834).</ref> In May 1834, the church adopted a resolution that the church would be known thereafter as \"The Church of the Latter Day Saints\".<ref name = 1834name/> At various times the church was also referred to as \"The Church of Jesus Christ\", \"The Church of God\",<ref name = othernames/> and \"The Church of Christ of Latter Day Saints\".<ref name = anderson/><ref name = black/>\n\nIn the late 1830s, Smith and those loyal to him founded a new headquarters in [[Far West, Missouri]].

After Smith's death, competing Latter Day Saint denominations organized under the leadership of a number of successors. The largest of these, led by [[Brigham Young]] and now based in [[Salt Lake City, Utah]], continued using \"Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints\" until incorporating in 1851, when the church standardized the spelling of its name as \"[[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]]\" (LDS Church).<ref>[http://www.jrcls.org/publications/perspectives/Lesson%20Plan%20re%20Law%20and%20Church%20as%20an%20Institution%20-%202.pdf Lesson: Law and the Church as an Institution].</ref> Followers of [[James J.

As King of Bohemia and Holy Roman Emperor, he transformed Prague into an imperial capital and it was at that time by the area the third-largest city in Europe (after Rome and [[Constantinople]]).\n\nCharles IV ordered the building of the [[New Town, Prague|New Town]] (Nov\u00e9 M\u011bsto) adjacent to the [[Old Town (Prague)|Old Town]] and laid out the design himself. The Charles Bridge, replacing the Judith Bridge destroyed in the flood just prior to his reign, was erected to connect the east bank districts to the Mal\u00e1 Strana and castle area. On 9 July 1357 at 5:31&nbsp;am, Charles IV personally laid the first foundation stone for the Charles Bridge. The exact time of laying the first foundation stone is known because the [[palindromic number]] 135797531 was carved into the Old Town bridge tower having been chosen by the royal astrologists and numerologists as the best time for starting the bridge construction.<ref>Stone, Andrew.

The work is reputed to have been ordered by Charles IV as a means of providing employment and food to the workers and their families.\n\nCharles IV died in 1378. During the reign of his son, King [[Wenceslaus, King of the Romans|Wenceslaus IV]] (1378\u20131419), a period of intense turmoil ensued.

He lived in the Prague Castle, where his court welcomed not only astrologers and magicians but also scientists, musicians, and artists. Rudolf was an art lover too, and Prague became the capital of European culture. This was a prosperous period for the city: famous people living there in that age include the astronomers [[Tycho Brahe]] and [[Johannes Kepler]], the painter [[Giuseppe Arcimboldo|Arcimboldo]], the alchemists [[Edward Kelley]] and [[John Dee]], the poet [[Elizabeth Jane Weston]], and others.\n\nIn 1618, the famous [[Defenestrations of Prague|second defenestration of Prague]] provoked the [[Thirty Years' War]], a particularly harsh period for Prague and Bohemia. [[Ferdinand II, Holy Roman Emperor|Ferdinand II]] of Habsburg was deposed, and his place as King of Bohemia taken by [[Frederick V, Elector Palatine]]; however his army was crushed in the [[Battle of White Mountain]] (1620) not far from the city. Following this in 1621 was an execution of 27 Czech Protestant leaders (involved in the uprising) in Old Town Square and the exiling of many others.

The population increased to 80,000 inhabitants by 1771. Many rich merchants and nobles enhanced the city with a host of palaces, churches and gardens full of art and [[Music from Eighteenth-Century Prague|music]], creating a [[Baroque]] city renowned throughout the world to this day.\n\nIn 1784, under [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor|Joseph II]], the four municipalities of Mal\u00e1 Strana, Nov\u00e9 M\u011bsto, Star\u00e9 M\u011bsto, and Hrad\u010dany were merged into a single entity. The Jewish district, called [[Josefov]], was included only in 1850. The [[Industrial Revolution]] had a strong effect in Prague, as factories could take advantage of the coal mines and ironworks of the nearby region. A first suburb, [[Karl\u00edn]], was created in 1817, and twenty years later the population exceeded 100,000.\n\n[[Revolutions of 1848|The revolutions in Europe in 1848]] also touched Prague, but they were fiercely suppressed. In the following years, the [[Czech National Revival]] began its rise, until it gained the majority in the town council in 1861. Prague had a German-speaking majority in 1848, but by 1880 the number of German speakers had decreased to 14% (42,000), and by 1910 to 6.7% (37,000), due to a massive increase of the city's overall population caused by the influx of [[Czechs]] from the rest of Bohemia and [[Moravia]] and also due to return of social status importance of the Czech language.\n\n===20th century===\n[[File:Masaryk in Prague.jpg|thumb|[[Statue of Tom\u00e1\u0161 Garrigue Masaryk, Prague|Statue]] of [[Tom\u00e1\u0161 Garrigue Masaryk]] near [[Prague Castle]]]]\n\n====First Czechoslovak Republic====\n{{Main|First Czechoslovak Republic}}\nWorld War I ended with the defeat of the [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]] and the creation of Czechoslovakia.

the capital of the Czech Republic and as such is the regular seat of its central authorities. Since 24 November 1990, it is de facto again a statutory town, but has a specific status of the municipality and the region at the same time. Prague also houses the administrative institutions of the Central Bohemia Region.\n\nUntil 1949, all administrative districts of Prague were formed by the whole one or more cadastral unit, municipality or town. Since 1949, there has been a fundamental change in the administrative division. Since then, the boundaries of many urban districts, administrative districts and city districts are independent of the boundaries of cadastral territories and some cadastral territories are thus divided into administrative and self-governing parts of the city. [[Cadastre|Cadastral area]] (for example, [[Vinohrady]], [[Sm\u00edchov]]) are still relevant especially for the registration of land and real estate and house numbering.\n\nPrague is composed of 112 cadastral territories of different size, character and importance. The city also consists of 22 administrative districts (1\u201322).[[H\u00e1jek (Prague)|Hajek]] is a district of Prague.{{citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\n===City government===\n[[File:Zden\u011bk H\u0159ib 2019 Praha.jpg|thumb|upright|Mayor [[Zden\u011bk H\u0159ib]]]]\nPrague is automously administered by the [[Prague City Assembly]], which is elected through municipal elections and consists of 55 to 70 members.

The Charles Bridge, replacing the Judith Bridge destroyed in the flood just prior to his reign, was erected to connect the east bank districts to the Mal\u00e1 Strana and castle area. On 9 July 1357 at 5:31&nbsp;am, Charles IV personally laid the first foundation stone for the Charles Bridge. The exact time of laying the first foundation stone is known because the [[palindromic number]] 135797531 was carved into the Old Town bridge tower having been chosen by the royal astrologists and numerologists as the best time for starting the bridge construction.<ref>Stone, Andrew.

The work is reputed to have been ordered by Charles IV as a means of providing employment and food to the workers and their families.\n\nCharles IV died in 1378. During the reign of his son, King [[Wenceslaus, King of the Romans|Wenceslaus IV]] (1378\u20131419), a period of intense turmoil ensued.

Rudolf was an art lover too, and Prague became the capital of European culture. This was a prosperous period for the city: famous people living there in that age include the astronomers [[Tycho Brahe]] and [[Johannes Kepler]], the painter [[Giuseppe Arcimboldo|Arcimboldo]], the alchemists [[Edward Kelley]] and [[John Dee]], the poet [[Elizabeth Jane Weston]], and others.\n\nIn 1618, the famous [[Defenestrations of Prague|second defenestration of Prague]] provoked the [[Thirty Years' War]], a particularly harsh period for Prague and Bohemia. [[Ferdinand II, Holy Roman Emperor|Ferdinand II]] of Habsburg was deposed, and his place as King of Bohemia taken by [[Frederick V, Elector Palatine]]; however his army was crushed in the [[Battle of White Mountain]] (1620) not far from the city.

The Jewish district, called [[Josefov]], was included only in 1850. The [[Industrial Revolution]] had a strong effect in Prague, as factories could take advantage of the coal mines and ironworks of the nearby region. A first suburb, [[Karl\u00edn]], was created in 1817, and twenty years later the population exceeded 100,000.\n\n[[Revolutions of 1848|The revolutions in Europe in 1848]] also touched Prague, but they were fiercely suppressed.

Prague is also a windy city with common sustained western winds and an average wind speed of {{convert|16|km/h|mph|0|abbr=on}} that often help break temperature inversions and clear the air in cold

the capital of the Czech Republic and as such is the regular seat of its central authorities. Since 24 November 1990, it is de facto again a statutory town, but has a specific status of the municipality and the region at the same time. Prague also houses the administrative institutions of the Central Bohemia Region.\n\nUntil 1949, all administrative districts of Prague were formed by the whole one or more cadastral unit, municipality or town. Since 1949, there has been a fundamental change in the administrative division. Since then, the boundaries of many urban districts, administrative districts and city districts are independent of the boundaries of cadastral territories and some cadastral territories are thus divided into administrative and self-governing parts of the city. [[Cadastre|Cadastral area]] (for example, [[Vinohrady]], [[Sm\u00edchov]]) are still relevant especially for the registration of land and real estate and house numbering.\n\nPrague is composed of 112 cadastral territories of different size, character and importance. The city also consists of 22 administrative districts (1\u201322).[[H\u00e1jek (Prague)|Hajek]] is a district of Prague.{{citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\n===City government===\n[[File:Zden\u011bk H\u0159ib 2019 Praha.jpg|thumb|upright|Mayor [[Zden\u011bk H\u0159ib]]]]\nPrague is automously administered by the [[Prague City Assembly]], which is elected through municipal elections and consists of 55 to 70 members.
