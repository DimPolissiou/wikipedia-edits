{"title_page": "Criticism of the Catholic Church", "text_new": "{{short description|Criticism of the Catholic Church}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=May 2019}}\n{{Roman Catholicism}}\n\n[[The Catholic Church]] has been subject to criticism throughout its history for its beliefs and practices.  Criticisms of the Catholic Church's religious beliefs and practices have often led to breaks with other Christian groups, such as the [[East-West Schism|schism with the Eastern Orthodox Church]] and the [[Protestant Reformation]].  The Catholic Church has also been criticized for its active efforts to influence political (like brexit as a form of politics) decisions, such as the Church's promotion of the [[Crusades]] and its involvement with various 20th century nationalist regimes.  More recent criticism focuses on alleged scandals within the Church, particularly alleged financial corruption and the [[Catholic Church sexual abuse cases|Catholic Church's sexy abuse scandals]].  \n\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Internal==\n===Use of Latin===\n{{Main|Mass of Paul VI}}\nBefore the reforms from [[Vatican II]] in the late 1960s the Catholic Church was best-known outside the church for the [[Tridentine Mass]], said mostly in [[Latin]] with a few sentences in [[Greek language|Ancient Greek]] and [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ewtn.com/library/LITURGY/TRIDMASS.TXT |title=Ordinary of the Tridentine Mass, 1962 Edition |accessdate=2012-07-23}}</ref>\nSince 1970, the Mass has been celebrated in the local language of where it is celebrated, and the Mass in Latin less frequently. A minority of Roman Catholics however prefer the Mass to be celebrated in Latin, generally arguing that the Latin text is more authentic, and truer to scripture and doctrine than the [[Mass of Paul VI]]. However, in 2007, Pope [[Benedict XVI]] loosened some restrictions on its use with the aim of healing the rift that had come about between advocates of the Novus Ordo Mass and those of the Tridentine Mass.<ref>{{cite news|last=Israely |first=Jeff |url=http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,1641008,00.html |title=Why the Pope is Boosting Latin Mass |publisher=Time |date=7 July 2007 |accessdate=2012-07-23}}</ref>\n\nThe 2007 ''motu proprio'' [[Summorum Pontificum]], allowing a wider use of the [[Tridentine Mass]] raised concerns in the Jewish community regarding the Good Friday liturgy which contained a prayer \"[[Good Friday prayer for the Jews|For the conversion of the Jews]]\" referring to Jewish \"blindness\" and prays for them to be \"delivered from their darkness.\"<ref>{{cite news|last=Westcott |first=Kathryn |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/6585247.stm |title=Concerns over Pope's Latin Mass move BBC World |publisher=BBC News |date=27 April 2007 |accessdate=2012-07-23}}</ref> The [[American Jewish Committee]] pointed out that this raises \"negative implications that some in the Jewish community and beyond have drawn concerning the motu proprio.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ajc.org/site/apps/nl/content2.asp?c=ijITI2PHKoG&b=1531911&ct=4070065|title=AJC Seeks Clarification on Latin Mass - AJC: Global Jewish Advocacy Legacy Site|access-date=2007-08-07|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070807023800/http://www.ajc.org/site/apps/nl/content2.asp?c=ijITI2PHKoG&b=1531911&ct=4070065|archive-date=2007-08-07|url-status=dead}}</ref> In response to such complaints, Pope Benedict XVI in 2008 replaced the prayer in the 1962 Missal with [[Good Friday Prayer for the Jews#2008 prayer|a newly composed prayer]] that makes no mention of blindness or darkness. \n\n===Traditionalist Catholics===\n{{Main|Traditionalist Catholicism}}\nSome [[Traditionalist Catholic]]s see the Church's reforms in liturgy and teaching following the [[Second Vatican Council]] as contrary to the traditional teaching of the Church. Some groups, such as the [[Society of St. Pius X]], have rejected certain decisions of the Holy See that they see as harmful to the faith.\n\n===Clerical celibacy===\n{{Main article|Clerical celibacy in the Catholic Church}}\n\nIn the Catholic Church priestly celibacy is seen as a [[Spiritual gift|charism]] bestowed by the Holy Spirit, enabling one to make a total commitment of oneself in service of the kingdom of God.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=89VDCQAAQBAJ&pg=PA26&lpg=PA26&dq=priestly+celibacy+and+the+imminent+end+of+the+age&source=bl&ots=PKt8eTVtjs&sig=oF65DRzsT4t--B-leU1fy7o3wJY&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwi8vIDZ4r7aAhXKy4MKHdU-CvMQ6AEIKjAA#v=onepage&q=priestly%20celibacy%20and%20the%20imminent%20end%20of%20the%20age&f=false|title=Priestly celibacy: a gift and a commitment (can. 277 \u00a7 1).|last=Emeka|first=Aroh Prudentius|date=19 May 2014|publisher=Gregorian Biblical BookShop|year=|isbn=9788878392830|location=|pages=26|language=en}}</ref> The scriptural basis for this is found in Matthew 19:12 and 1 Corinthians 7:32-35.\n\nMarried men can be ordained to the permanent diaconate, but only unmarried men may be ordained priests. As celibacy is a discipline rather than doctrine, it can be abrogated in particular situations, as when, for example, married Anglican priests are ordained to the Catholic priesthood to minister in [[personal ordinariates]]. (Members of the Anglican hierarchy found the creation of the personal ordinariate \"insensitive\".)<ref name=\"response\">{{cite news | url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/religion/the-pope/8276262/Popes-offer-was-an-insensitive-takeover-bid-say-senior-Anglicans.html | date=23 January 2011 | accessdate=25 January 2011 | title=Pope's offer was an 'insensitive takeover bid', say senior Anglicans | journal=[[Daily Telegraph]] | first=Jonathan|last=Wynne-Jones | location=London}}</ref>\n\nSome Eastern Rite Catholic Churches such as the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church allow the ordination of married men as priests. Only unmarried men may be ordained to the episcopate. Priestly celibacy continues to be the subject of a good deal of discussion. Proponents who view this as something that should be revisited say that it precludes otherwise qualified candidates from the priesthood, noting a shortage of priests in some areas.\n\nThe [[Wisconsin Evangelical Lutheran Synod]] has strongly criticized clerical celibacy as a violation of Biblical teaching.<ref name=WELS-Lent>[https://web.archive.org/web/20090928151314/http://www.wels.net/cgi-bin/site.pl?1518&cuTopic_topicID=19&cuItem_itemID=15268 WELS Topical Q&A: Roman Catholic Lent], by [[Archive.org]]</ref> Martin Luther wrote the following regarding priestly celibacy in \"''On Monastic Vows''\":\n\n{{quote|If you obey the gospel, you ought to regard celibacy as a matter of free choice. \u2026 They [Jesus and Paul] glory in faith alone.

In 1979, Sister Theresa Kane, then president of the [[Leadership Conference of Women Religious]] challenged Pope John Paul II from the podium at the [[Basilica of the National Shrine of the Immaculate Conception|National Shrine of the Immaculate Conception]] in Washington, DC, to include women \u201cin all ministries of our Church\u201d.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.thenation.com/article/american-nuns-guilty-charged/|title=American Nuns: Guilty as Charged?|last=Bonavoglia|first=Angela|date=2012-05-21|access-date=2019-06-04|language=en-US|issn=0027-8378}}</ref>\n\nIn his Apostolic Letter ''Ordinatio sacerdotalis'' (1994), [[Pope John Paul II]] said the \"Priestly ordination, \u2026 has in the Catholic Church from the beginning always been reserved to men alone.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://w2.vatican.va/content/john-paul-ii/en/apost_letters/1994/documents/hf_jp-ii_apl_19940522_ordinatio-sacerdotalis.html|title=Ordinatio Sacerdotalis (May 22, 1994) {{!}} John Paul II|website=w2.vatican.va|access-date=2019-06-04}}</ref> He cited the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith (under [[Pope Paul VI]]) ''Declaration Inter Insigniores on the question of the Admission of Women to the Ministerial Priesthood'',<ref>CDF, ''Declaration Inter Insigniores on the question of the Admission of Women to the Ministerial Priesthood'' (15 October 1976): AAS 69 (1977), 98-116</ref> and declared that \u201cthe Church has no authority whatsoever to confer priestly ordination on women and that this judgment is to be definitively held by all the Church's faithful.\u201d{{sfn|Ordinatio sacerdotalis, \u00a74}} The reasons given included: \"the example recorded in the Sacred Scriptures of Christ choosing his Apostles only from among men; the constant practice of the Church, which has imitated Christ in choosing only men; and her living teaching authority which has consistently held that the exclusion of women from the priesthood is in accordance with God's plan for his Church.\" \n\nSome groups, nonetheless, say the matter should still be open for discussion. Dissenters do not regard ''Ordinatio sacerdotalis'' as definitive Church teaching. But in June 2018 [[Pope Francis]] said, \"We cannot do this with Holy Orders (women priests) because dogmatically we cannot. Pope John Paul II was clear and closed the door and I'm not going to go back on that. It [John Paul's decision] was serious, it was not a capricious thing.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-pope-interview-excerpts-idUKKBN1JG2UN|title=Excerpts from Pope Francis' interview with Reuters|date=20 June 2018|publisher=|via=uk.reuters.com}}</ref> But from the start of his papacy Francis has pointed out that \"if sacramental power is too closely identified with power in general. It must be remembered that when we speak of sacramental power \u201cwe are in the realm of function, not that of dignity or holiness'\u201d (EG 104).\n\nSince Vatican II, women have taken an increased role in the Church.  In 1994, the Vatican [[Congregation for Divine Worship and the Discipline of the Sacraments]] formally interpreted the 1983 Code of Canon Law, stating that women could assist at Mass as acolytes or [[altar server]]s. Women also serve as lectors and [[Extraordinary minister of Holy Communion|extraordinary ministers]]. Still many people see the Church's position on the ordination of women as a sign that women are not equal to men in the Catholic Church, though the Church rejects this inference.<ref>Rausch, Thomas P. Catholicism in the Third Millennium. Collegeville, Minnesota: The Liturgical Press, 2003.</ref>  In a separate but related issue, Pope Francis set up the  Pontifical Commission for the Study of the Diaconate of Women to study women deacons in the early church, to help answer the question of whether women could also serve as deacons today. The Commission submitted its inconclusive report to Pope Francis in January 2019.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.americamagazine.org/faith/2019/05/07/pope-francis-says-commission-women-deacons-did-not-reach-agreement|title=Pope Francis says commission on women deacons did not reach agreement|date=2019-05-07|website=America Magazine|language=en|access-date=2019-06-04}}</ref>\n\n==Interfaith==\n===Judaism===\n{{Main|Medieval antisemitism|Blood curse}}\n\nIn the [[Middle Ages]], religion played a major role in driving [[antisemitism]]. ''[[Adversus Judaeos]]'' (\"against the Judeans\") are a series of fourth century homilies by [[John Chrysostom]] directed to members of the [[church of Antioch]] of his time, which continued to observe Jewish feasts and fasts. Critical of this, he cast Judaism and the [[synagogue]]s in his city in a critical and negative light. The use of hyperbole and other rhetorical devices painted a harsh and negative picture of the Jews. This was largely ignored until the Jewish anti-Christian teachings began to surface in Muslim Andalusia in the 11th and 12th centuries.<ref>[http://ejournals.bc.edu/ojs/index.php/scjr/article/download/1800/1688 The Jewish Critique of Christianity: In Search of a New Narrative]</ref> According to historian [[William I.

Catholic officials replied that their efforts in Russia were not aimed at Orthodox believers, but were reaching out to the vast majority of Russians who are not churchgoers. The Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith rejected the characterization of \"proselytizing\" and said that respect towards non Catholic Christians must not negate the possibility of conversion, if an individual should so chose.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://new.asianews.it/index.php?l=en&art=11043 |title=Asia News |access-date=2007-12-17 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071215151437/http://new.asianews.it/index.php?l=en&art=11043 |archive-date=2007-12-15 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n===Protestantism===\n{{Main|Reformation}}\n\nCommon factors that played a role during the [[Reformation]] and the [[Counter-Reformation]] included the rise of nationalism, simony, the appointment of Cardinal-nephews, the sale of [[Indulgence|indulgences]], and other corruption in the Roman Curia and other ecclesiastical hierarchy, as well as the impact of humanism, the new learning of the Renaissance, the epistemological shift between the ''schola moderna'' and ''schola antiqua'' within scholasticism, and the Western Schism that eroded loyalty to the Papacy. \n\nKey events of the period include: the [[Council of Trent]] (1545\u20131563); the excommunication of [[Elizabeth I]] (1570); the [[Battle of Lepanto]] (1571); the adoption of the [[Gregorian calendar]] under [[Pope Gregory XIII]]; the [[French Wars of Religion]]; the [[Long Turkish War]]; the final phases of the [[Thirty Years' War]] (1618\u20131648); and the formation of the last [[Holy League (1684)|Holy League]] by [[Pope Innocent XI|Innocent XI]] during the [[Great Turkish War]].\n\nProtestants hold doctrinal differences with the Catholic Church in a number of areas, including the understanding of the meaning of the word \"faith\" and how it relates to \"good works\" in terms of salvation, and a difference of opinion regarding the concept of \"justification\", and the Catholic Church's belief in [[Sacred Tradition]] as a source of revelation complementary to Sacred Scripture.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140531175312/https://www.vatican.va/archive/hist_councils/ii_vatican_council/documents/vat-ii_const_19651118_dei-verbum_en.html|title=Dogmatic Constitution on Divine Revelation - Dei Verbum|date=2014-05-31|website=web.archive.org|access-date=2019-06-04}}</ref> Some scholars of Early Christianity are adherents of the [[New Perspective on Paul]] and so believe \"sola fide\" is a misinterpretation on the part of Lutherans and that Paul was actually speaking about laws (such as Circumcision, Dietary laws, Sabbath, Temple rituals, etc.) that were considered essential for the Jews of the time.<ref>{{Cite book|title = The New Perspective on Paul|last = Dunn|first = James D.

Dissenters do not regard ''Ordinatio sacerdotalis'' as definitive Church teaching. But in June 2018 [[Pope Francis]] said, \"We cannot do this with Holy Orders (women priests) because dogmatically we cannot. Pope John Paul II was clear and closed the door and I'm not going to go back on that.

It must be remembered that when we speak of sacramental power \u201cwe are in the realm of function, not that of dignity or holiness'\u201d (EG 104).\n\nSince Vatican II, women have taken an increased role in the Church.  In 1994, the Vatican [[Congregation for Divine Worship and the Discipline of the Sacraments]] formally interpreted the 1983 Code of Canon Law, stating that women could assist at Mass as acolytes or [[altar server]]s. Women also serve as lectors and [[Extraordinary minister of Holy Communion|extraordinary ministers]]. Still many people see the Church's position on the ordination of women as a sign that women are not equal to men in the Catholic Church, though the Church rejects this inference.<ref>Rausch, Thomas P. Catholicism in the Third Millennium. Collegeville, Minnesota: The Liturgical Press, 2003.</ref>  In a separate but related issue, Pope Francis set up the  Pontifical Commission for the Study of the Diaconate of Women to study women deacons in the early church, to help answer the question of whether women could also serve as deacons today.

Critical of this, he cast Judaism and the [[synagogue]]s in his city in a critical and negative light.

Before the 12th century, Christianity gradually suppressed what it saw as [[heresy]] usually through a system of ecclesiastical sanctions, [[excommunication]], and [[anathema]]. Later, an accusation of heresy could be construed as treason against lawful civil rule, and therefore punishable by civil sanctions such as confiscation of property, imprisonment, or death, though the latter was not frequently imposed, as this form of punishment had many ecclesiastical opponents.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08026a.htm |title=Catholic Encyclopedia: Inquisition |publisher=Newadvent.org |accessdate=2012-07-23}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://bulfinch.englishatheist.org/mm/inquisition/Chapter7.htm |title=A History of the Inquisition In The Middle Ages.

Kushner is the elder son of the former real-estate developer [[Charles Kushner]], the son of Jewish immigrants from the [[Soviet Union|USSR]], and is married to [[Ivanka Trump]], President Trump's daughter and fellow advisor. As a result of his father's conviction and incarceration for fraud, he took over management of his father's real estate company [[Kushner Companies]], which launched his business career. He later also bought [[Observer Media]], publisher of the ''[[New York Observer]]''. He is the co-founder and part owner of [[Cadre (company)|Cadre]], an online real-estate investment platform.\n\nDuring the [[Donald Trump 2016 presidential campaign|2016 Trump presidential campaign]], Kushner helped develop and run Trump's [[digital media]] strategy. On January 9, 2017, he was named as a senior White House advisor. As senior White House advisor, Kushner stirred controversy for his conflicts of interest, as he continued to engage in business, even profiting on policy proposals that he himself pushed for within the administration. Kushner was unable to obtain Top Secret Security clearance until May 2018, when Trump reportedly intervened on his son-in-law's behalf.\n\nAs senior White House advisor, Kushner pushed strongly for the [[FIRST STEP Act]], a criminal justice reform bill which Trump signed into law in 2018. Kushner authored a peace plan in the [[Israeli-Palestinian conflict]], which was announced in January 2020, but which was seen as overwhelmingly favoring Israel.

Kushner is the elder son of the former real-estate developer [[Charles Kushner]], the son of Jewish immigrants from the [[Soviet Union|USSR]], and is married to [[Ivanka Trump]], President Trump's daughter and fellow advisor. As a result of his father's conviction and incarceration for fraud, he took over management of his father's real estate company [[Kushner Companies]], which launched his business career. He later also bought [[Observer Media]], publisher of the ''[[New York Observer]]''. He is the co-founder and part owner of [[Cadre (company)|Cadre]], an online real-estate investment platform.\n\nDuring the [[Donald Trump 2016 presidential campaign|2016 Trump presidential campaign]], Kushner helped develop and run Trump's [[digital media]] strategy. On January 9, 2017, he was named as a senior White House advisor. As senior White House advisor, Kushner stirred controversy for his conflicts of interest, as he continued to engage in business, even profiting on policy proposals that he himself pushed for within the administration. Kushner was unable to obtain Top Secret Security clearance until May 2018, when Trump reportedly intervened on his son-in-law's behalf.\n\nAs senior White House advisor, Kushner pushed strongly for the [[FIRST STEP Act]], a criminal justice reform bill which Trump signed into law in 2018. Kushner authored a peace plan in the [[Israeli-Palestinian conflict]], which was announced in January 2020, but which was seen as overwhelmingly favoring Israel. Kushner had an influential role within the Trump administration in its response to the [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic]], which included advising Trump in the first two months of the outbreak that the media was exaggerating the threat of the virus, and later on helping to draft an error-riddled Oval Office address about the crisis.\n\n== Early life (1981\u20132007) ==\nKushner was born in [[Livingston, New Jersey]], to Seryl Kushner (n\u00e9e Stadtmauer) and [[Charles Kushner]], a real-estate developer.<ref>{{cite magazine |url=http://nymag.com/news/features/57891/ |title=The Legacy |magazine=[[New York (magazine)|New York]]|date=July 12, 2009 |first=Gabriel |last=Sherman |accessdate=January 3, 2015 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150103120035/http://nymag.com/news/features/57891/ |archivedate=January 3, 2015 }}</ref> His paternal grandparents, Reichel and [[Joseph Kushner]], were Holocaust survivors who came to the U.S. in 1949 from [[Navahrudak]], now in [[Belarus]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://belarusdigest.com/story/what-does-trumps-presidency-mean-for-belarus/ |title=What Does Trump's Presidency Mean for Belarus? |last=Rudnik |first=Alesia |last2=Smok |first2=Vadzim |date=November 18, 2016 |website=BelarusDigest.com |archive-url=https://archive.today/20180709183434/https://belarusdigest.com/story/what-does-trumps-presidency-mean-for-belarus/ |archive-date=July 9, 2018 |url-status=live |access-date=July 9, 2018 }}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine |url=http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/01/jared-kushner-trump-administration-power.html |title=The Young Trump: Jared Kushner's Rise to Unimaginable Power |first=Andrew |last=Rice |magazine=[[New York (magazine)|New York]]|date=January 8, 2017 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170115000329/http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/01/jared-kushner-trump-administration-power.html |archivedate=January 15, 2017 }}</ref> Morris Stadtmauer was Jared's [[maternal grandfather]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Kushner Insider January 30, 2015 |url=https://www.jkha.org/pages/weekly-updates/digest/kushner-insider-1-30-15 |website=[[Joseph Kushner Hebrew Academy]]/[[Rae Kushner Yeshiva High School]] |accessdate=July 7, 2018 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160422084708/https://www.jkha.org/pages/weekly-updates/digest/kushner-insider-1-30-15 |archivedate=April 22, 2016  |date=January 30, 2015}}</ref> \n\nRaised in a [[Modern Orthodox Judaism|Modern Orthodox Jewish]] family,<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.jpost.com/Diaspora/Jared-Kushner-once-broke-up-with-Ivanka-Trump-over-religion-issue-464353 |title=Jared Kushner once broke up with Ivanka Trump over 'religion issue' |newspaper=[[The Jerusalem Post]]|url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170224132903/http://www.jpost.com/Diaspora/Jared-Kushner-once-broke-up-with-Ivanka-Trump-over-religion-issue-464353 |archivedate=February 24, 2017 }}</ref> Kushner graduated from the [[Frisch School]], a Modern Orthodox [[Jewish day school|yeshiva high school]], in 1999.
