Co-produced by [[Shawn Levy]] and [[Lisa Henson]] for [[Walt Disney Pictures]] through their respective production companies, [[21 Laps Entertainment]] and [[The Jim Henson Company]], the film was released in North America on October 10, 2014.<ref name=\"THRAug21\" /> The film received mixed reviews from critics but was a success at the box office, grossing $101.4 million worldwide against a $28 million budget.\n\n==Plot== \nThe movie follows 11-year-old Alexander Cooper ([[Ed Oxenbould]]) on a \"terrible, horrible, no-good, very bad day.\" Living in suburban [[Los Angeles]], Alexander often feels left-out by his family: baby brother Trevor (Elise/Zoey Vargas); elder siblings Anthony ([[Dylan Minnette]]) and Emily ([[Kerris Dorsey]]); and their parents, Kelly ([[Jennifer Garner]]) and Ben ([[Steve Carell]]).\n\nAnthony is trying to earn his [[driver's license]] so he can drive his demanding and sharp-tongued girlfriend, Celia, to the [[junior prom]]; Emily is rehearsing for the [[Peter Pan|title role]] in her ''Peter Pan'' school play; Kelly works for a [[publication company]] on a new children's book which will get her promoted to vice-president of said company; Ben, who has been unemployed for seven months, has landed an interview for a job as a video [[game designer]].\n\nThat morning, Alexander experiences a series of mishaps at school: he accidentally sets fire to his crush Becky Gibson's notebook; his classmate Elliot sent a humiliating photoshopped image of him to the whole school; and he finds out that his friends - including Becky, and even his best friend Paul - will all be attending Philip Parker (Lincoln Melcher)'s birthday party, instead of Alexander's, due to Philip's expensive party entertainment and popularity. That night, Alexander puts a candle on a homemade birthday [[sundae]]. He wishes that everyone in his family could relate to what he is going through.\n\nThe next morning, Alexander wakes up to find the rest of his family in chaotic disarray: his parents have overslept; Emily has a cold from rehearsing in the car; Celia has broken up with Anthony, due to her overhearing and misinterpreting a conversation between the Cooper brothers the night before. Kelly's car is dead, due to Emily's having left the light on the previous night and draining the battery. Ben has to take Trevor with him to the interview, after dropping Kelly off at work. At school, Alexander learns that Philip's birthday party has been canceled because Philip has [[chickenpox]]; Becky and Paul, along with all the other kids who had originally planned to attend Philip's party, will attend Alexander's party instead. Delighted, Alexander asks his father to plan a party for him. Meanwhile, Kelly is informed of an embarrassing typo in the book they are publicizing (\"dump\" instead of \"jump\"); she attempts to prevent [[Dick Van Dyke]] from reading it at a public event they have scheduled. Ben takes Trevor along to his interview; his prospective boss, Greg ([[Donald Glover]]), seems impressed by Ben's credentials. However, they decide to hold another meeting, after Trevor ingests a non-toxic [[highlighter]]. Back at school, Anthony patches things up with Celia. He jumps up in excitement but accidentally hits a banner which is attached to a couple of trophy cases, causing them to fall over and break, leading to his suspension.\n\nKelly arrives at Dick Van Dyke's reading too late to warn him about the book's typo. He then reads the inappropriate material, humiliating himself, shocking the audience, and almost getting Kelly arrested. Meanwhile, Ben purchases [[cough syrup]] for his ill daughter en route to the [[Department of Motor Vehicles]]; there Anthony's driving examiner, Ms. Suggs, cruelly tricks him into taking his eyes off the road by using sarcasm to persuade him to answer his [[cell phone]]. This causes Anthony to destroy several parking meters, damage the [[Chrysler Town & Country|family minivan]], and miserably fail his driving exam. As the entire Cooper family bemoans their collective lot, Alexander cuts in and admits his birthday wish to them. He apologizes for making everyone suffer the nightmarish day they've had. Ben disagrees: the day is not ruined yet, because it isn't ''over'' yet. Right then and there, the whole family resolves to stay as positive as they can.\n\nAfter renting a [[tuxedo]] for Anthony, the Coopers go to Emily's play, of which she makes a spectacular [[farce]] with her abnormally rambunctious behavior, after [[overdosing]] on extra-strength cough syrup and going out inebriated. The game-design firm calls and invites Ben to Nagamaki, a Japanese [[hibachi]] restaurant, for another meeting. The family, joined by Celia, head to the restaurant in their badly-damaged minivan. There Ben accidentally sets his shirt-sleeves on fire at the grill, embarrassing himself in front of the employers. Ben's wife and kids console him, vowing that they will overcome whatever else the day has in store for them. Alexander also points out that \"you gotta have bad days, so you can enjoy your good days even more\". Inspired by this, Anthony changes his mind about going to the prom with Celia; he states that his family is more important than she has given them credit for. \n\nThe Cooper's return home to find an alligator in their house from the petting zoo that Ben and Kelly planned for Alexander's birthday. Alexander is excited, but the people setting up the pens tell them that a kangaroo got out. As they manage to get the alligator in the pool, the kangaroo passes by, and Ben runs after it. He finds it in a neighbor's yard, and the kangaroo kicks him. They manage to get it back to the house.\n\nAll of Alexander's friends turn up for his birthday, including Becky. She says the party is pretty awesome. Ben and Kelly both get phone calls. Ben gets the job and Kelly is told that Dick Van Dyke's reading of the book went viral, and that the book is already selling fast. They look outside and see that their kids are enjoying themselves. They bring out a cake for Alexander. He makes a wish that there be more days like this one (which the rest of the family say \"NO!!!!!\"). Alexander finished by saying that for a pretty bad day, this one turned out to be the best day ever.\n\n==Cast==\n{{colbegin}}\n* [[Ed Oxenbould]] as Alexander Cooper, third born of the Cooper children and the main protagonist.<ref name=\"THRAug21\" />\n* [[Steve Carell]] as Ben Cooper, father of the Cooper children.<ref name=\"comingsoon1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.comingsoon.net/films.php?id=68281 |title=Alexander and the Terrible, Horrible, No Good, Very Bad Day Trailer, News, Videos, and Reviews |publisher=ComingSoon.net |date= |accessdate=August 27, 2013}}</ref>\n* [[Jennifer Garner]] as Kelly Cooper, mother of the Cooper children.<ref name=\"comingsoon1\" />\n* [[Dylan Minnette]] as Anthony Cooper, first child of the Cooper children.

[[comedy film]] directed by [[Miguel Arteta]] from a screenplay written by Rob Lieber. The film stars [[Steve Carell]], [[Jennifer Garner]], and [[Ed Oxenbould]], and is loosely based on [[Judith Viorst]]\u2019s 1972 [[Alexander and the Terrible, Horrible, No Good, Very Bad Day|children's book of the same name]]. Co-produced by [[Shawn Levy]] and [[Lisa Henson]] for [[Walt Disney Pictures]] through their respective production companies, [[21 Laps Entertainment]] and [[The Jim Henson Company]], the film was released in North America on October 10, 2014.<ref name=\"THRAug21\" /> The film received mixed reviews from critics but was a success at the box office, grossing $101.4 million worldwide against a $28 million budget.\n\n==Plot== \nThe movie follows 11-year-old Alexander Cooper ([[Ed Oxenbould]]) on a \"terrible, horrible, no-good, very bad day.\" Living in suburban [[Los Angeles]], Alexander often feels left-out by his family: baby brother Trevor (Elise/Zoey Vargas); elder siblings Anthony ([[Dylan Minnette]]) and Emily ([[Kerris Dorsey]]); their parents, Kelly ([[Jennifer Garner]]) and Ben ([[Steve Carell]]).\n\nAnthony is trying to earn his [[driver's license]] so he can drive his demanding and sharp-tongued girlfriend, Celia, to the [[junior prom]]; Emily is rehearsing for the [[Peter Pan|title role]] in her ''Peter Pan'' school play; Kelly works for a [[publication company]] on a new children's book which will get her promoted to vice-president of said company; Ben, who has been unemployed for seven months, has landed an interview for a job as a video [[game designer]].\n\nThat morning, Alexander experiences a series of mishaps at school: he accidentally sets fire to his crush Becky Gibson's notebook; his classmate Elliot sent a humiliating photoshopped image of him to the whole school; and he finds out that his friends - including Becky, and even his best friend Paul - will all be attending Philip Parker (Lincoln Melcher)'s birthday party, instead of Alexander's, due to Philip's expensive party entertainment and popularity. That night, Alexander puts a candle on a homemade birthday [[sundae]]. He wishes that everyone in his family could relate to what he is going through.\n\nThe next morning, Alexander wakes up to find the rest of his family in chaotic disarray: his parents have overslept; Emily has a cold from rehearsing in the car; Celia has broken up with Anthony, due to her overhearing and misinterpreting a conversation between the Cooper brothers the night before. Kelly's car is dead, due to Emily's having left the light on the previous night and draining the battery. Ben has to take Trevor with him to the interview, after dropping Kelly off at work. At school, Alexander learns that Philip's birthday party has been canceled because Philip has [[chickenpox]]; Becky and Paul, along with all the other kids who had originally planned to attend Philip's party, will attend Alexander's party instead. Delighted, Alexander asks his father to plan a party for him. Meanwhile, Kelly is informed of an embarrassing typo in the book they are publicizing (\"dump\" instead of \"jump\"); she attempts to prevent [[Dick Van Dyke]] from reading it at a public event they have scheduled. Ben takes Trevor along to his interview; his prospective boss, Greg ([[Donald Glover]]), seems impressed by Ben's credentials. However, they decide to hold another meeting, after Trevor ingests a non-toxic [[highlighter]]. Back at school, Anthony patches things up with Celia. He jumps up in excitement but accidentally hits a banner which is attached to a couple of trophy cases, causing them to fall over and break, leading to his suspension.\n\nKelly arrives at Dick Van Dyke's reading too late to warn him about the book's typo. He then reads the inappropriate material, humiliating himself, shocking the audience, and almost getting Kelly arrested. Meanwhile, Ben purchases [[cough syrup]] for his ill daughter en route to the [[Department of Motor Vehicles]]; there Anthony's driving examiner, Ms. Suggs, cruelly tricks him into taking his eyes off the road by using sarcasm to persuade him to answer his [[cell phone]]. This causes Anthony to destroy several parking meters, damage the [[Chrysler Town & Country|family minivan]], and miserably fail his driving exam. As the entire Cooper family bemoans their collective lot, Alexander cuts in and admits his birthday wish to them. He apologizes for making everyone suffer the nightmarish day they've had. Ben disagrees: the day is not ruined yet, because it isn't ''over'' yet. Right then and there, the whole family resolves to stay as positive as they can.\n\nAfter renting a [[tuxedo]] for Anthony, the Coopers go to Emily's play, of which she makes a spectacular [[farce]] with her abnormally rambunctious behavior, after [[overdosing]] on extra-strength cough syrup and going out inebriated. The game-design firm calls and invites Ben to Nagamaki, a Japanese [[hibachi]] restaurant, for another meeting. The family, joined by Celia, head to the restaurant in their badly-damaged minivan. There Ben accidentally sets his shirt-sleeves on fire at the grill, embarrassing himself in front of the employers. Ben's wife and kids console him, vowing that they will overcome whatever else the day has in store for them. Alexander also points out that \"you gotta have bad days, so you can enjoy your good days even more\". Inspired by this, Anthony changes his mind about going to the prom with Celia; he states that his family is more important than she has given them credit for. \n\nThe Cooper's return home to find an alligator in their house from the petting zoo that Ben and Kelly planned for Alexander's birthday. Alexander is excited, but the people setting up the pens tell them that a kangaroo got out. As they manage to get the alligator in the pool, the kangaroo passes by, and Ben runs after it. He finds it in a neighbor's yard, and the kangaroo kicks him. They manage to get it back to the house.\n\nAll of Alexander's friends turn up for his birthday, including Becky. She says the party is pretty awesome. Ben and Kelly both get phone calls. Ben gets the job and Kelly is told that Dick Van Dyke's reading of the book went viral, and that the book is already selling fast. They look outside and see that their kids are enjoying themselves. They bring out a cake for Alexander. He makes a wish that there be more days like this one (which the rest of the family say \"NO!!!!!\"). Alexander finished by saying that for a pretty bad day, this one turned out to be the best day ever.\n\n==Cast==\n{{colbegin}}\n* [[Ed Oxenbould]] as Alexander Cooper, third born of the Cooper children and the main protagonist.<ref name=\"THRAug21\" />\n* [[Steve Carell]] as Ben Cooper, father of the Cooper children.<ref name=\"comingsoon1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.comingsoon.net/films.php?id=68281 |title=Alexander and the Terrible, Horrible, No Good, Very Bad Day Trailer, News, Videos, and Reviews |publisher=ComingSoon.net |date= |accessdate=August 27, 2013}}</ref>\n* [[Jennifer Garner]] as Kelly Cooper, mother of the Cooper children.<ref name=\"comingsoon1\" />\n* [[Dylan Minnette]] as Anthony Cooper, first child of the Cooper children.

For instance, an operator may require advanced intelligence from the production system in order to make the most efficient decisions for scheduling maintenance or production orders.

A digital twin can be realized in this layer by integrating cyberspace to the physical components through [[tactile internet]]. Moreover, similarity-based methods can be used to perform peer to peer comparison across machines and help in better fault diagnosis and enhancing their efficiency.\n\n* Cognition layer\nIn this layer, infographic tools are utilized to present the results of analytic studies to the users. Simple radar charts and degradation trends can be used for a simple representation of the component's health condition. Then operators can easily make a decision based on the presented data.\n\n* Configuration layer\nIn this layer, the decisions made in the Cognition layer are applied to the physical system to make the systems self-adapt, self-configure, and self resilient.\n\n==Statistics==\nThe [[Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry]] in [[South Korea]] announced on 10 March 2016 that it had aided the construction of smart factories in 1,240 [[small and medium enterprise]]s, which it said resulted in an average 27.6% decrease in defective products, 7.1% faster production of prototypes, and 29.2% lower cost.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://businesskorea.co.kr/english/news/industry/14073-smart-benefits-smart-factories-improving-productivity-smes|title=Smart Factories Improving Productivity of SMEs |author=Jung Min-hee |date=March 11, 2016}}</ref>\n\n== Action and effects ==\nFrom Siemens' perspective,<ref name=\":3\" /> there are three core elements to this evolution:\n# '''''Manufacturing execution'''''. Manufacturing execution will play an even more important role. The degree of connectivity between the automation level and the manufacturing execution system (MES) will increase significantly, also across the borders of companies and locations. The integration of Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) and MES levels will also advance to achieve complete transparency as well as connectivity to business data. That means that all necessary information is available in real time.\n# '''''The merging of the product and production life cycle'''''. The second core element is the merging of product and production life cycle based on a common data model. This will allow manufacturers to meet the challenges that result through ever-shorter product life cycles, both technically and in business.\n# '''''Cyber-physical systems'''''. [[Cyber-physical systems]] are a basis for the increase in manufacturing flexibility that results in shorter time to market. These production units can be flexibly integrated into existing production processes. Cyber physical systems combine communications, IT, data, and physical elements using core technologies, including sensor networks; Internet communication infrastructure; intelligent, real-time processing and event management; big data and data provisioning; embedded software for logic; and automated operations and management of systemic activities across enterprises.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Open manufacturing]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* [http://cesmii.org/ CESMII - US National Institute on Smart Manufacturing]\n* [http://ec.europa.eu/research/industrial_technologies/factories-of-the-future_en.html Factories of the Future]\n* [http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2503064 The Smart Factory: Exploring an Open Innovation Solution for Manufacturing Ecosystems: http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2503064]\n* [http://www.techrepublic.com/article/ge-launches-microfactory-to-co-create-the-future-of-manufacturing/#ftag=RSS56d97e7 GE launches 'microfactory' to co-create the future of manufacturing]\n\n[[Category:Manufacturing]]\n", "text_old": "{{merge from|Industry 4.0|date=June 2019}}\n{{buzzword|date=April 2019}}\n{{speculation|date=June 2019}}\n\n'''Smart manufacturing''' is a broad category of [[manufacturing]] that employs [[computer-integrated manufacturing]], high levels of adaptability and rapid design changes, digital information technology, and more flexible technical workforce training.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite journal|title = Smart manufacturing, manufacturing intelligence and demand-dynamic performance|journal = Computers & Chemical Engineering|date = 2012-12-20|pages = 145\u2013156|volume = 47|series = FOCAPO 2012|doi = 10.1016/j.compchemeng.2012.06.037|first = Jim|last = Davis|first2 = Thomas|last2 = Edgar|first3 = James|last3 = Porter|first4 = John|last4 = Bernaden|first5 = Michael|last5 = Sarli}}</ref> Other goals sometimes include fast changes in production levels based on demand,<ref name=\"SMLC 2011\">SMLC 2011</ref> optimization of the [[supply chain]],<ref name=\"SMLC 2011\"/> efficient production and recyclability.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.wilsoncenter.org/sites/default/files/Emerging_Global_Trends_in_Advanced_Manufacturing.pdf|title=Emerging Global Trends in Advanced Manufacturing|last=Shipp|first=Stephanie S.|authorlink=Stephanie Shipp|date=March 2012|website=Emerging Global Trends in Advanced Manufacturing|publisher=Insititute for Defense Analysis|access-date=April 2016}}</ref> In this concept, as '''smart factory''' has interoperable systems, multi-scale dynamic modelling and simulation, intelligent automation, strong cyber security, and networked sensors.\n\nThe broad definition of smart manufacturing covers many different technologies.

Manufacturing execution will play an even more important role. The degree of connectivity between the automation level and the manufacturing execution system (MES) will increase significantly, also across the borders of companies and locations. The integration of Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) and MES levels will also advance to achieve complete transparency as well as connectivity to business data. That means that all necessary information is available in real time.\n# '''''The merging of the product and production life cycle'''''. The second core element is the merging of product and production life cycle based on a common data model. This will allow manufacturers to meet the challenges that result through ever-shorter product life cycles, both technically and in business.\n# '''''Cyber-physical systems'''''. [[Cyber-physical systems]] are a basis for the increase in manufacturing flexibility that results in shorter time to market. These production units can be flexibly integrated into existing production processes. Cyber physical systems combine communications, IT, data, and physical elements using core technologies, including sensor networks; Internet communication infrastructure; intelligent, real-time processing and event management; big data and data provisioning; embedded software for logic; and automated operations and management of systemic activities across enterprises.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Open manufacturing]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* [http://cesmii.org/ CESMII - US National Institute on Smart Manufacturing]\n* [http://ec.europa.eu/research/industrial_technologies/factories-of-the-future_en.html Factories of the Future]\n* [http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2503064 The Smart Factory: Exploring an Open Innovation Solution for Manufacturing Ecosystems: http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2503064]\n* [http://www.techrepublic.com/article/ge-launches-microfactory-to-co-create-the-future-of-manufacturing/#ftag=RSS56d97e7 GE launches 'microfactory' to co-create the future of manufacturing]\n\n[[Category:Manufacturing]]\n", "name_user": "Industrial-4.0", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eSmart Manufacturing Paradigms", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smart_manufacturing"}

The [[riff]], played on a [[Fender Stratocaster]] [[electric guitar]] by Blackmore, is later joined by hi-hat and distorted organ, then the rest of the [[Drum kit|drums]], then [[bass guitar|electric bass]] parts before the start of [[Ian Gillan]]'s vocal.

On the eve of the recording session, a [[Frank Zappa]] and [[The Mothers of Invention]] concert was held in the casino's theatre. This was to be the theatre's final concert before the casino complex closed down for its annual winter renovations, which would allow Deep Purple to record there. At the beginning of [[Don Preston]]'s synthesizer solo on \"King Kong\", the place suddenly caught fire when somebody in the audience fired a [[flare gun]] toward the [[rattan]] covered ceiling, as mentioned in the \"some stupid with a flare gun\" line.<ref>''The Real Frank Zappa Book'' by Frank Zappa with Peter Occhiogrosso, pg. 112, {{ISBN|0-671-63870-X}}</ref><ref>''Bang Your Head'' by David Konow, page 26, {{ISBN|0-609-80732-3}}</ref> Although there were no major injuries, the resulting fire destroyed the entire casino complex, along with all the Mothers' equipment. The \"smoke on the water\" that became the title of the song (credited to bass guitarist [[Roger Glover]], who related how the title occurred to him when he woke from a dream a few days later) referred to the smoke from the fire spreading over [[Lake Geneva]] from the burning [[Montreux Casino|casino]] as the members of Deep Purple watched from their hotel. \"It was probably the biggest fire I'd ever seen up to that point and probably ever seen in my life\" said Glover. \"It was a huge building. I remember there was very little panic getting out, because it didn't seem like much of a fire at first. But, when it caught, it went up like a fireworks display.\" The \"Funky Claude\" running in and out is referring to [[Claude Nobs]], the director of the [[Montreux Jazz Festival]] who helped some of the audience escape the fire.<ref name=obit>{{cite web|title=Claude Nobs, Montreux Jazz Festival founder, dies|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-20981739|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=23 October 2019}}</ref>\n[[File:Claude Nobs1.jpg|thumb|left|[[Claude Nobs]] (2006), the \"Funky Claude\" mentioned in the song]]\nLeft with an expensive mobile recording unit and no place to record, the band was forced to scout the town for another place to set up. One promising venue (found by Nobs) was a local theatre called The Pavilion, but soon after the band loaded in and started working/recording, neighbours took offence at the noise. The band was only able to lay down backing tracks for one song (based on Blackmore's riff and temporarily named \"Title No.1\"), before local police shut them down.<ref name=\u201cIndependent\u201d>{{cite news |title=How Deep Purple created their best hit 'Smoke on the Water' |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/long_reads/deep-purple-montreux-jazz-festival-lake-geneva-1971-a8418926.html |accessdate=10 April 2020 |work=The Independent}}</ref>\n\nAfter about a week of searching, the band rented the nearly-empty [[H\u00f4tel des Alpes-Grand H\u00f4tel|Grand H\u00f4tel de Territet]] and converted its hallways and stairwells into a makeshift studio, where they laid down most of the tracks for what would become their most commercially successful album, ''[[Machine Head (album)|Machine Head]]'' (which is dedicated to Claude Nobs).<ref>{{cite news |title=Deep Purple revient sur le lieu o\u00f9 est n\u00e9 \u00abSmoke on the Water\u00bb |url=https://www.tdg.ch/culture/musique/deep-purple-revient-smoke-the-water/story/29995483 |accessdate=10 April 2020 |work=Tribune deGeneve}}</ref><ref>[https://www.bbc.co.uk/music/sevenages/events/heavy-metal/deep-purple-release-machine-head/ Deep Purple release 'Machine Head'] BBC. Retrieved 19 October 2011</ref>\n\nThe only song from ''Machine Head'' not recorded entirely in the Grand Hotel was \"Smoke on the Water\" itself, which had been partly recorded during the abortive Pavilion session. Its lyrics were composed later, primarily by Gillan and based around Glover's title, and the vocals were recorded in the Grand Hotel.<ref name=\u201cIndependent\u201d/>\n\nBecause of the incident and the exposure Montreux received when \"Smoke on the Water\" became an international hit, Deep Purple formed a lasting bond with the town. The song is honoured in Montreux by a sculpture along the lake shore (right next to the statue of [[Queen (band)|Queen]] frontman [[Freddie Mercury]]) with the band's name, the song title, and the riff in musical notes. The new casino in Montreux displays notes from the riff as decoration on its balustrade facing the gambling hall.\n\nOn the ''[[Classic Albums]]'' episode about ''Machine Head'', [[Ritchie Blackmore]] claimed friends of the band were not fans of the \"Smoke on the Water\" riff, which they thought too simplistic. Blackmore retorted by making comparisons to the first movement of [[Symphony No. 5 (Beethoven)|Beethoven's 5th Symphony]], which revolves around a similar four note arrangement.\n\n\"The amazing thing with that song, and Ritchie's riff in particular,\" observed [[Ian Paice]], \"is that somebody hadn't done it before, because it's so gloriously simple and wonderfully satisfying.\"<ref>{{cite magazine|first=Paul|last=Rees|title=To Infinity\u2026 and Beyond?|magazine=[[Classic Rock (magazine)|Classic Rock]] #234|date=April 2017|p=39}}</ref>\n\n==Impact==\n{{more citations needed section|date=August 2019}}\n\"Smoke on the Water\" was included on ''Machine Head'', which was released in early 1972, but was not released as a single until a year later, in May 1973. (\"[[Never Before (song)|Never Before]]\" and \"[[Highway Star (song)|Highway Star]]\" were the first singles issued from the album.) The band members have said that they did not expect the song to be a hit, but the single reached number 4 on the Billboard pop singles chart in the United States during the summer of 1973, number 2 on the Canadian [[RPM (magazine)|RPM]] charts, and it propelled the album to the top 10. Live performances of the tune, featuring extended interplay between Blackmore's guitar and [[Jon Lord]]'s [[Hammond organ]] would become a centrepiece of Deep Purple's live shows, and a version of the song from the live album ''[[Made in Japan (Deep Purple album)|Made in Japan]]'' became a minor hit on its own later on in 1973.\n\nThe principal songwriters included the song within their subsequent solo ventures after Deep Purple had split up. Ian Gillan in particular performed a jazz-influenced version in early solo concerts. The band [[Gillan (band)|Gillan]] adopted a feedback-soaked approach, courtesy of Gillan guitarist [[Bernie Torme]]. This song was also featured live by Ritchie Blackmore's post-Deep Purple band [[Rainbow (English band)|Rainbow]] during their tours 1981\u201383, and again after Rainbow was resurrected briefly in the mid-1990s and for three European concerts in June 2016.\n\nDuring Ian Gillan's stint with [[Black Sabbath]] in 1983, they performed \"Smoke on the Water\" as a regular repertoire number on encores during their only tour together. It remains one of the few cover songs that Black Sabbath has ever played live.\n\nThe song is popular amongst beginner guitarists, but Blackmore himself has demonstrated that most who attempt to play it do so improperly. Actually played using \"[[all fourths]]\" (or [[double stops]]) as specified by Blackmore, a [[power chord]]-driven variation on the main recognizable riff is not difficult, and is consequently often played by learners.\n\n\"Smoke on the Water\" has received the following rankings:\n* 434 on ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine's [[The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time]] (2004)<ref name=\"RollingStone\">[https://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/the-500-greatest-songs-of-all-time-20110407/deep-purple-smoke-on-the-water-19691231 500 Greatest Songs of All Time: Deep Purple, 'Smoke on the Water'] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120703000445/http://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/the-500-greatest-songs-of-all-time-20110407/deep-purple-smoke-on-the-water-19691231 |date=3 July 2012}} Rolling Stone.

In 2004, the song was ranked number 434 on ''Rolling Stone'' magazine's list of [[Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Songs of All Time|the 500 greatest songs of all time]],<ref name=\"RollingStone\"/> ranked number 4 in ''[[Total Guitar]]'' magazine's Greatest Guitar Riffs Ever,<ref name=\"BBC\"/> and in March 2005, [[Q (magazine)|''Q'' magazine]] placed \"Smoke on the Water\" at number 12 in its list of the 100 greatest guitar tracks.<ref name=\"QMagazine\"/>\n\n==Composition==\n{{Original research|section|date=August 2019}}\n[[File:Smoke on the Water riff.jpg|thumb|left|The ''Smoke on the Water'' riff]] \"Smoke on the Water\" is easily identified by its central theme, developed by guitarist [[Ritchie Blackmore]]. It is a four-note [[blues scale]] melody in [[G minor]], harmonised in parallel fourths. The [[riff]], played on a [[Fender Stratocaster]] [[electric guitar]] by Blackmore, is later joined by hi-hat and distorted organ, then the rest of the [[Drum kit|drums]], then [[bass guitar|electric bass]] parts before the start of [[Ian Gillan]]'s vocal. Blackmore later claimed that the riff is an interpretation of inversion of [[Symphony No. 5 (Beethoven)|Symphony No. 5]] by [[Ludwig van Beethoven]], and that \"I owe him a lot of money\".<ref name=\"Thompson2004\">{{cite book|last=Thompson|first=Dave|title=Smoke on the Water: The Deep Purple Story|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LzzCw6xs9roC|year=2004|publisher=ECW Press|isbn=978-1-55022-618-8|page=128}}</ref>\n\nThe opening lyrics are:\n{{poemquote|We all came out to Montreux, on the Lake Geneva shoreline\nTo make records with a [[Rolling Stones Mobile Studio|mobile]], we didn't have much time}}\n\n[[Jon Lord]] doubles the guitar part on a [[Hammond organ|Hammond C3 organ]] played through a distorted Marshall amp, creating a tone very similar to that of the guitar.

Blackmore played the intro on the 3rd and 5th fret of a [[Sunburst (finish)|3 tone sunburst]] [[Fender Stratocaster]], often turning his back to the camera or the audience. Later on, he can be seen using his thumb top-down on the E and A strings on 8th and 10th fret, as follows:\n\n<pre style=\"display:inline-block\">-------------------------------------------\n-------------------------------------------\n-------------------------------------------\n------8-10-----8-11-10--------8-10--8------\n---10-8-10--10-8-11-10-----10-8-10--8-10---\n---10-------10-------------10---------10---</pre>\n\nThere are two solos in the song; the first was performed on guitar by Ritchie Blackmore, and the second was performed on an organ by Jon Lord until the song fades out.\n\n==History==\n{{quote box|width=27%|bgcolor=#FFFFF0|align=right|quote=We all came out to Montreux,<br />\nOn the Lake Geneva shoreline.<br />To make records with a mobile,<br />We didn't have much time.<br />Frank Zappa and the Mothers,<br />Were at the best place around.<br />But some stupid with a flare gun,<br />Burned the place to the ground.<br />Smoke on the water, fire in the sky.|source=\u2014Opening verse and chorus of Smoke on the Water recollecting the fire.}}\nThe lyrics tell a true story: On 4 December 1971, Deep Purple were in [[Montreux]], [[Switzerland]], to record an album using a mobile recording studio (rented from [[the Rolling Stones]] and known as the [[Rolling Stones Mobile Studio]]\u2014referred to as the \"Rolling truck Stones thing\" and \"a mobile\" in the lyrics) at the entertainment complex that was part of the [[Montreux Casino]] (referred to as \"the gambling house\" in the song lyric). On the eve of the recording session, a [[Frank Zappa]] and [[The Mothers of Invention]] concert was held in the casino's theatre. This was to be the theatre's final concert before the casino complex closed down for its annual winter renovations, which would allow Deep Purple to record there. At the beginning of [[Don Preston]]'s synthesizer solo on \"King Kong\", the place suddenly caught fire when somebody in the audience fired a [[flare gun]] toward the [[rattan]] covered ceiling, as mentioned in the \"some stupid with a flare gun\" line.<ref>''The Real Frank Zappa Book'' by Frank Zappa with Peter Occhiogrosso, pg. 112, {{ISBN|0-671-63870-X}}</ref><ref>''Bang Your Head'' by David Konow, page 26, {{ISBN|0-609-80732-3}}</ref> Although there were no major injuries, the resulting fire destroyed the entire casino complex, along with all the Mothers' equipment. The \"smoke on the water\" that became the title of the song (credited to bass guitarist [[Roger Glover]], who related how the title occurred to him when he woke from a dream a few days later) referred to the smoke from the fire spreading over [[Lake Geneva]] from the burning [[Montreux Casino|casino]] as the members of Deep Purple watched from their hotel. \"It was probably the biggest fire I'd ever seen up to that point and probably ever seen in my life\" said Glover. \"It was a huge building. I remember there was very little panic getting out, because it didn't seem like much of a fire at first. But, when it caught, it went up like a fireworks display.\" The \"Funky Claude\" running in and out is referring to [[Claude Nobs]], the director of the [[Montreux Jazz Festival]] who helped some of the audience escape the fire.<ref name=obit>{{cite web|title=Claude Nobs, Montreux Jazz Festival founder, dies|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-20981739|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=23 October 2019}}</ref>\n[[File:Claude Nobs1.jpg|thumb|left|[[Claude Nobs]] (2006), the \"Funky Claude\" mentioned in the song]]\nLeft with an expensive mobile recording unit and no place to record, the band was forced to scout the town for another place to set up. One promising venue (found by Nobs) was a local theatre called The Pavilion, but soon after the band loaded in and started working/recording, neighbours took offence at the noise. The band was only able to lay down backing tracks for one song (based on Blackmore's riff and temporarily named \"Title No.1\"), before local police shut them down.<ref name=\u201cIndependent\u201d>{{cite news |title=How Deep Purple created their best hit 'Smoke on the Water' |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/long_reads/deep-purple-montreux-jazz-festival-lake-geneva-1971-a8418926.html |accessdate=10 April 2020 |work=The Independent}}</ref>\n\nAfter about a week of searching, the band rented the nearly-empty [[H\u00f4tel des Alpes-Grand H\u00f4tel|Grand H\u00f4tel de Territet]] and converted its hallways and stairwells into a makeshift studio, where they laid down most of the tracks for what would become their most commercially successful album, ''[[Machine Head (album)|Machine Head]]'' (which is dedicated to Claude Nobs).<ref>{{cite news |title=Deep Purple revient sur le lieu o\u00f9 est n\u00e9 \u00abSmoke on the Water\u00bb |url=https://www.tdg.ch/culture/musique/deep-purple-revient-smoke-the-water/story/29995483 |accessdate=10 April 2020 |work=Tribune deGeneve}}</ref><ref>[https://www.bbc.co.uk/music/sevenages/events/heavy-metal/deep-purple-release-machine-head/ Deep Purple release 'Machine Head'] BBC. Retrieved 19 October 2011</ref>\n\nThe only song from ''Machine Head'' not recorded entirely in the Grand Hotel was \"Smoke on the Water\" itself, which had been partly recorded during the abortive Pavilion session. Its lyrics were composed later, primarily by Gillan and based around Glover's title, and the vocals were recorded in the Grand Hotel.<ref name=\u201cIndependent\u201d/>\n\nBecause of the incident and the exposure Montreux received when \"Smoke on the Water\" became an international hit, Deep Purple formed a lasting bond with the town. The song is honoured in Montreux by a sculpture along the lake shore (right next to the statue of [[Queen (band)|Queen]] frontman [[Freddie Mercury]]) with the band's name, the song title, and the riff in musical notes. The new casino in Montreux displays notes from the riff as decoration on its balustrade facing the gambling hall.\n\nOn the ''[[Classic Albums]]'' episode about ''Machine Head'', [[Ritchie Blackmore]] claimed friends of the band were not fans of the \"Smoke on the Water\" riff, which they thought too simplistic. Blackmore retorted by making comparisons to the first movement of [[Symphony No. 5 (Beethoven)|Beethoven's 5th Symphony]], which revolves around a similar four note arrangement.\n\n\"The amazing thing with that song, and Ritchie's riff in particular,\" observed [[Ian Paice]], \"is that somebody hadn't done it before, because it's so gloriously simple and wonderfully satisfying.\"<ref>{{cite magazine|first=Paul|last=Rees|title=To Infinity\u2026 and Beyond?|magazine=[[Classic Rock (magazine)|Classic Rock]] #234|date=April 2017|p=39}}</ref>\n\n==Impact==\n{{more citations needed section|date=August 2019}}\n\"Smoke on the Water\" was included on ''Machine Head'', which was released in early 1972, but was not released as a single until a year later, in May 1973. (\"[[Never Before (song)|Never Before]]\" and \"[[Highway Star (song)|Highway Star]]\" were the first singles issued from the album.) The band members have said that they did not expect the song to be a hit, but the single reached number 4 on the Billboard pop singles chart in the United States during the summer of 1973, number 2 on the Canadian [[RPM (magazine)|RPM]] charts, and it propelled the album to the top 10. Live performances of the tune, featuring extended interplay between Blackmore's guitar and [[Jon Lord]]'s [[Hammond organ]] would become a centrepiece of Deep Purple's live shows, and a version of the song from the live album ''[[Made in Japan (Deep Purple album)|Made in Japan]]'' became a minor hit on its own later on in 1973.\n\nThe principal songwriters included the song within their subsequent solo ventures after Deep Purple had split up. Ian Gillan in particular performed a jazz-influenced version in early solo concerts. The band [[Gillan (band)|Gillan]] adopted a feedback-soaked approach, courtesy of Gillan guitarist [[Bernie Torme]]. This song was also featured live by Ritchie Blackmore's post-Deep Purple band [[Rainbow (English band)|Rainbow]] during their tours 1981\u201383, and again after Rainbow was resurrected briefly in the mid-1990s and for three European concerts in June 2016.\n\nDuring Ian Gillan's stint with [[Black Sabbath]] in 1983, they performed \"Smoke on the Water\" as a regular repertoire number on encores during their only tour together. It remains one of the few cover songs that Black Sabbath has ever played live.\n\nThe song is popular amongst beginner guitarists, but Blackmore himself has demonstrated that most who attempt to play it do so improperly. Actually played using \"[[all fourths]]\" (or [[double stops]]) as specified by Blackmore, a [[power chord]]-driven variation on the main recognizable riff is not difficult, and is consequently often played by learners.\n\n\"Smoke on the Water\" has received the following rankings:\n* 434 on ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine's [[The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time]] (2004)<ref name=\"RollingStone\">[https://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/the-500-greatest-songs-of-all-time-20110407/deep-purple-smoke-on-the-water-19691231 500 Greatest Songs of All Time: Deep Purple, 'Smoke on the Water'] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120703000445/http://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/the-500-greatest-songs-of-all-time-20110407/deep-purple-smoke-on-the-water-19691231 |date=3 July 2012}} Rolling Stone.

This created a need for more systematic architectural education, and the absence of such opportunities caused many aspiring Canadian architects to study in the United States, where ten architecture schools had already been established.<ref name=History /> Canada did not yet have any formal architectural education, and the only forms of architectural education in Montreal were periodical lectures by local practising architects at McGill's affiliated religious colleges. This new need for architectural education is an important factor that led to the founding of the School of Architecture at McGill University.<ref name=Beginning>{{cite web|url=https://www.mcgill.ca/architecture/school/history/beginning|title=The beginning with Stewart H.

Macdonald]] created a chair in architecture at McGill which was led by [[Stewart Henbest Capper]]. At this time, the School offered a four-year course to prepare students for professional accreditation. The first graduating class was composed of three students: George Taylor Hyde, Norman M.

This required the School to briefly use McGill's [[Dawson College]], a [[satellite campus]] in St. Jean, Quebec, to accommodate its students.

This created a need for more systematic architectural education, and the absence of such opportunities caused many aspiring Canadian architects to study in the United States, where ten architecture schools had already been established.<ref name=History /> Canada did not yet have any formal architectural education, and the only forms of architectural education in Montreal were periodical lectures by local practising architects at McGill's affiliated religious colleges. This new need for architectural education is an important factor that led to the founding of the School of Architecture at McGill University.<ref name=Beginning>{{cite web|url=https://www.mcgill.ca/architecture/school/history/beginning|title=The beginning with Stewart H.

At this time, the School offered a four-year course to prepare students for professional accreditation. The first graduating class was composed of three students: George Taylor Hyde, Norman M.

This required the School to briefly use McGill's [[Dawson College]], a [[satellite campus]] in St. Jean, Quebec, to accommodate its students.

In addition to the seven schools with whom the School of Architecture has bilateral agreements, architecture students have spent exchange semesters at some of the top architecture schools in the world, including [[The Bartlett]] at [[University College London (UCL)]], [[National University of Singapore]], [[University of Leeds]], [[University of Liverpool]], [[University of Sheffield]] and [[Australian National University]].\n\n==Academics==\nThe School of Architecture offers a professional program in Architecture comprising a Bachelor of Science in Architecture (BSc[Arch]) and professional Master of Architecture (MArch) degree, as well as post-professional graduate programs leading to a Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) and post-professional Master of Architecture (MArch) degree. The School has a reputation for excellence in teaching, with all of its professors being either practicing architects or holding professional degrees and/or PhDs,<ref name=Faculty /> and architecture professors often being awarded teaching awards proportionately more often than other departments within the Faculty of Engineering relative to their respective sizes.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.mcgill.ca/engineering/faculty-staff/teaching-research-and-service-awards|title=Teaching, Research & Service Awards, Faculty of Engineering|accessdate=8 March 2020}}</ref>\n\n===Professional programs===\n* '''BSc(Arch)''' \u2013 3 years, 100 credits\n* '''MArch (Professional)''':\n** Design Studio \u2013 1.5 years, 45 credits, or\n** Design Studio (Directed Research) \u2013 2 years, 60 credits\n\nThe MArch (Professional) degree is accredited by the [[Professional requirements for architects#Canada|Canadian Architectural Certification Board]] (CACB), and is recognized by the [[National Council of Architectural Registration Boards]] (NCARB) in the United States.<ref name=Accreditation />\n\n===Post-professional research programs===\n* '''MArch (Non-Thesis)''':\n** Architectural History and Theory \u2013 45 credits\n** Urban Design and Housing \u2013 45 credits\n* '''PhD'''\n<ref name=Programs />\n\n===Admissions===\nThe McGill School of Architecture has the smallest entering class per degree offered of any architecture school in Canada. With a maximum capacity of 50 undergraduate students in the first year undergraduate studio (BSc[Arch]) and 35 students in both of the Master's (MArch&nbsp;1 and MArch&nbsp;II) studios, the School has one of the most selective and competitive sets of program offerings in the country with one of the lowest overall application-to-acceptance ratios.<ref name=Stats /> \n\nGenerally, about 5\u201310 students from outside Quebec who plan to study architecture for their undergraduate degree will spend their first year at McGill in U0, taking the necessary engineering prerequisites required for the 3-year BSc (Architecture) program at the School of Architecture. Students coming from Quebec [[CEGEP]]s enter directly into the BSc Architecture program, or U1, but are required to have received a [[Diploma of college studies|DEC]] in either pure and applied science or health sciences, as these degrees fulfill the engineering prerequisites for the Architecture program.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.mcgill.ca/architecture/programs/professional#application|title=Application procedures|publisher=Peter Guo-hua Fu School of Architecture, McGill University|accessdate=27 March 2020}}</ref>\n\nOffers of acceptance into the program are based on a unique review process including an evaluation of a portfolio of works and extracurricular involvement, in addition to grades.

Bucci played for several Italian clubs throughout his career; he is mostly remembered for his successful spell with [[Parma F.C.|Parma]], where he won various domestic and European titles. At international level, he represented the [[Italy national football team]], and was an unused member of the team that reached the [[1994 FIFA World Cup Final]], and a reserve goalkeeper for Italy at [[UEFA Euro 1996]].\n\n==Club career==\nBorn in [[Bologna]], Bucci spent a few years in [[Serie C1|the third]] and [[Serie B|second levels]] (winning the [[1992\u201393 Serie B|1992\u201393 Serie B title]] with [[A.C. Reggiana|Reggiana]]). He made his [[Serie A]] debut playing for [[A.C. Parma|Parma]], in a league match against [[Udinese Calcio|Udinese ]] on 29 August 1993. He soon achieved  prominence during a particularly successful stint with the club, winning an [[UEFA Supercup]] in 1993, and an [[1994\u201395 UEFA Cup|UEFA Cup]] in 1995; he also received runners-up medals in the [[1994\u201395 Coppa Italia|Coppa Italia]], in the [[1993\u201394 European Cup Winners' Cup|Cup Winners' Cup]], in the [[1995 Supercoppa Italiana|Supercoppa Italiana]], and in [[1996\u201397 Serie A|Serie A]] with the club. Bucci was the starting keeper for Parma when they won the UEFA cup in 1995. At Parma, however, Bucci was soon overtaken by the emergence of 18-year-old ''Primavera'' keeper [[Gianluigi Buffon]] during the [[1996\u201397 Serie A|1996\u201397 season]]. Bucci started the season as the starting keeper for the first seven games. After dispute with the first time coach Carlos and emergence of Buffon,  moved Bucci to leave the team in order to play more regularly.<ref name=\"Luca Bucci e il numero 5 sulle spalle: una storia nera\">{{cite web|url=http://www.sportreview.it/calcio/oggetti-di-culto/luca-bucci-numero-5-sulle-spalle-storia-nera|title=Luca Bucci e il numero 5 sulle spalle: una storia nera|publisher=Sport Review.it|language=Italian|author1=Luca Momblano|accessdate=24 May 2015}}</ref><ref name=\"Bucci si sfila i guanti\">{{cite web|url=http://www.repubblica.it/2009/05/rubriche/la-storia/ritiro-bucci/ritiro-bucci.html|title=Bucci si sfila i guanti ''Se non ci fosse stato Buffon...''|publisher=La Repubblica|language=Italian|author1=Benedetto Ferrara|date=17 June 2009|accessdate=24 May 2015}}</ref>\n\nAfter playing six months for [[A.C.

He then decided to join [[Empoli F.C.|Empoli]]. However, he only managed to play in half of the games, while the club was [[2003\u201304 Serie A|eventually relegated]], with Bucci leaving at the end of season.<ref name=\"Luca Bucci e il numero 5 sulle spalle: una storia nera\"/><ref name=\"Bucci si sfila i guanti\"/>\n\nAfter six months without a club, Bucci moved back to Parma in January 2005 to replace [[Gianluca Berti]] who left for Torino,<ref>{{cite news|url=http://en.archive.uefa.com/competitions/uefacup/news/kind=1/newsid=274168.html|archive-url=https://archive.is/20120713011735/http://en.archive.uefa.com/competitions/uefacup/news/kind=1/newsid=274168.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=13 July 2012|title=Bucci answers Parma call|publisher=UEFA.com|date=20 January 2005|accessdate=7 July 2010}}</ref> initially as a reserve goalkeeper.

Bucci played for several Italian clubs throughout his career; he is mostly remembered for his successful spell with [[Parma F.C.|Parma]], where he won various domestic and European titles. At international level, he represented the [[Italy national football team]], and was an unused member of the team that reached the [[1994 FIFA World Cup Final]], and a reserve goalkeeper for Italy at [[UEFA Euro 1996]].\n\n==Club career==\nBorn in [[Bologna]], Bucci spent a few years in [[Serie C1|the third]] and [[Serie B|second levels]] (winning the [[1992\u201393 Serie B|1992\u201393 Serie B title]] with [[A.C. Reggiana|Reggiana]]). He made his [[Serie A]] debut playing for [[A.C. Parma|Parma]], in a league match against [[Udinese Calcio|Udinese ]] on 29 August 1993. He soon achieved  prominence during a particularly successful stint with the club, winning an [[UEFA Supercup]] in 1993, and an [[1994\u201395 UEFA Cup|UEFA Cup]] in 1995; he also received runners-up medals in the [[1994\u201395 Coppa Italia|Coppa Italia]], in the [[1993\u201394 European Cup Winners' Cup|Cup Winners' Cup]], in the [[1995 Supercoppa Italiana|Supercoppa Italiana]], and in [[1996\u201397 Serie A|Serie A]] with the club. Bucci was the starting keeper for Parma when they won the UEFA cup in 1995. At Parma, however, Bucci was soon overtaken by the emergence of 18-year-old ''Primavera'' keeper [[Gianluigi Buffon]] during the [[1996\u201397 Serie A|1996\u201397 season]]. Bucci started the season as the starting keeper for the first seven games. After dispute with the first time coach Carlos and emergence of Buffon,  moved Bucci to leave the team in order to play more regularly.<ref name=\"Luca Bucci e il numero 5 sulle spalle: una storia nera\">{{cite web|url=http://www.sportreview.it/calcio/oggetti-di-culto/luca-bucci-numero-5-sulle-spalle-storia-nera|title=Luca Bucci e il numero 5 sulle spalle: una storia nera|publisher=Sport Review.it|language=Italian|author1=Luca Momblano|accessdate=24 May 2015}}</ref><ref name=\"Bucci si sfila i guanti\">{{cite web|url=http://www.repubblica.it/2009/05/rubriche/la-storia/ritiro-bucci/ritiro-bucci.html|title=Bucci si sfila i guanti ''Se non ci fosse stato Buffon...''|publisher=La Repubblica|language=Italian|author1=Benedetto Ferrara|date=17 June 2009|accessdate=24 May 2015}}</ref>\n\nAfter playing six months for [[A.C.
