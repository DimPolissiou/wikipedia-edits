It emerged in the 1990s through the work of bands such as [[Neurosis (band)|Neurosis]] and [[Godflesh]] who transformed metal [[texture (music)|texture]] through [[experimental music|experimental]] composition. Associated with and inspired by [[post-rock]] and [[post-hardcore]], the genre employs the darkness and intensity of [[extreme metal]] but emphasizes atmosphere, emotion, and even \"[[revelation]]\", drawing on a wide range of sources including [[ambient music|ambient]], [[noise music|noise]], [[psychedelic music|psychedelic]], [[progressive music|progressive]], and [[classical music]] to develop an expansive but introspective sound. Post-metal songs are typically long, with loose and layered structures that discard the [[verse\u2013chorus form]] in favor of [[crescendo]]s and repeating [[Theme (music)|theme]]s. The sound centres on guitars and drums; any vocals are usually [[screaming (music)|screamed]] or [[death growl|growled]] and resemble an additional instrument.\n\nPost-metal is closely related to [[avant-garde metal]] and has also been associated with [[sludge metal]], [[drone metal]], [[progressive metal]], and [[industrial metal]].

This approach was pioneered by [[Agalloch]], who formed in 1995 and also employed elements of doom metal, [[progressive rock]], [[folk music]], and post-hardcore.<ref name=\"bandcamp\"/> [[Wolves in the Throne Room]], who became a significant act for American black metal by the release of their 2007 sophomore album ''[[Two Hunters]]'', were also inspired by Neurosis in combining \"ambience and violence\" to craft deeply melancholic music.<ref name=\"bandcamp\"/>\n\nWhile all post-metal pioneers except Broadrick are American, the genre soon spread internationally. In particular, the Japanese band [[Boris (band)|Boris]], formed in 1992, \"have always embraced the spirit and vitality of the vibrant movement\" and some of their works, such as the 2005 albums ''[[Dronevil]]'' and ''[[Pink (Boris album)|Pink]]'', have become influential to it.<ref name=\"bandcamp\"/> Boris often employ elements of [[drone music]] and have collaborated with prominent drone metal band [[Sunn O)))]],<ref name=\"bandcamp\"/> who have also been associated with post-metal.<ref name=\"nyt\" /> Several European bands also gained prominence within the genre, including [[Cult of Luna]] from Sweden, whose sound is indebted to Isis' ''Oceanic'',<ref name=\"steff\" /> [[Amenra]] from Belgium, who signed to Neurosis' label [[Neurot Recordings]] and rival their predecessors in sheer spiritual intensity,<ref name=\"amenra\">{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/features/amenra-mass-vi-album-stream-a8002161.html|title=AMENRA \u2013 MASS VI: Album Stream|last=Dedman|first=Remfry|newspaper=The Independent|date=16 October 2017|accessdate=16 October 2017}}</ref> and [[Year of No Light]] from France, who have transitioned from a sludge-oriented sound to monumental instrumental compositions, \"beautifully layered, but still dark and heavy\".<ref name=\"bandcamp\"/>\n\nAnother prominent instrumental band, [[Russian Circles]], was also strongly influenced by ''Oceanic''.<ref name=\"steff\" /> By contrast, [[True Widow]], whose sound is rooted as much in 1990s [[indie rock]] and [[psychedelic rock]] as in doom metal, offer a distinctive take on post-metal, most impactfully on the 2013's ''[[Circumambulation (album)|Circumambulation]]'', by employing \"male/female vocal interplay\" and showcasing \"vulnerability and restraint\".<ref name=\"bandcamp\"/> Meanwhile, the Melvins had made a direct mark on the sound they themselves inspired with the 2004 album ''[[Pigs of the Roman Empire]]'', a collaboration with [[dark ambient]] composer [[Lustmord]].<ref name=\"bandcamp\"/>\n\nGradually, post-metal as a genre has achieved major critical acclaim.<ref name=\"steff\" /> This was reinforced by the \"widely publicized\" success of [[Deafheaven]],<ref name=\"bandcamp\"/> whose sophomore album ''[[Sunbather (album)|Sunbather]]'' became one of the most celebrated releases of 2013. The band's successful fusion of caustic black metal with blissfull shoegazing in the vein of [[My Bloody Valentine (band)|My Bloody Valentine]] and [[Slowdive]],<ref name=\"bandcamp\"/> though preceded by the French musician [[Neige (musician)|Neige]] of [[Alcest]], was nicknamed [[blackgaze]] and met with disdain from fans of conventional [[extreme metal]]. It has also inspired a wave of bands such as [[Ghost Bath]], who often use undistorted guitar melodies to develop unsettling atmospheres, and Austria's [[Harakiri for the Sky]], whose despairing sound melds black metal and post-hardcore.<ref name=\"bandcamp\"/>\n\n[[File:Deafheaven @ A Colossal Weekend 2017 46.jpg|thumb|right|[[Deafheaven]] have brought the genre widespread critical acclaim in their fusion of [[black metal]] and [[shoegazing]].]]\n\n==Characteristics==\nPost-metal is generally heavy, aggressive, and dark, but explores a variety of musical approaches alien to conventional [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]] and [[extreme metal]].<ref name=\"bandcamp\"/> It mirrors [[post-rock]] and [[post-hardcore]] in its emphasis on atmosphere and deep emotion and may be considered abstract,<ref name=\"fact\" /> introspective,<ref name=\"steff\" /> expansive,<ref name=\"bbc1\">{{cite web | url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/music/reviews/zhj9 | title=Neurosis - Times of Grace Review | publisher=[[BBC]] | accessdate=January 5, 2016 | author=Moffitt, Greg}}</ref> [[hypnotic]],<ref name=\"gn\" /> [[progressive music|progressive]],<ref name=\"bbc1\" /> layered,<ref name=\"bandcamp\"/> or even [[Apocalypse|apocalyptic]].<ref name=\"bbc1\" /> Jon Wiederhorn writes that though some post-metal bands \"sought to break away from their raging roots by exploring less bombastic and more dynamic musical techniques\" and others \"sought to remain raw and corrosive\", their music shares a \"heavy-lidded yet eye-opening\" effect.<ref name=\"bandcamp\"/> ''[[The New York Times]]'' associated the term with a \"wave of bands using metal as a jumping-off point for a range of [[experimental music|experimental]] styles, dabbling in [[free jazz]], [[minimal music|minimalist]] post-rock, [[noise music|noise]] and even [[modern classical music]].\"<ref name=\"nyt\">{{cite news | last = Caraminica | first = Jon | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2005/09/20/arts/the-alchemy-of-artworld-heavy-metal.html | title = The alchemy of art-world heavy metal | newspaper = [[The New York Times]] | accessdate = 2005-09-20}}</ref> Contemporary post-metal bands incorporate influences ranging through [[doom metal]], [[black metal]], [[shoegazing]], [[progressive rock]], [[folk music]], and [[classical music]].<ref name=\"bandcamp\"/>\n\nWriting for [[Slate (magazine)|''Slate'']] in 2009, [[Simon Reynolds]] reflected:\n{{quote|[P]ost-rock doesn't have the same temporal aspect that [[post-disco]] or [[post-punk]] have; it's not about the ripples set in motion by a galvanizing \"event.\" Rather, it evokes a sense of \"going beyond\" the structures of a genre of music without completely abandoning its legacy of attitudes and assumptions. For similar reasons, the term post-metal seems increasingly useful to describe the vast and variegated swath of genres (the thousand flavors of doom/black/[[death metal|death]]/[[grindcore|grind]]/[[drone metal|drone]]/[[sludge metal|sludge]]/etc., ad infinitum) that emerged from the early '90s onward. Sometimes beat-free and [[ambient music|ambient]], increasingly the work of home-studio loners rather than performing bands, post-metal of the kind released by labels like [[Hydra Head Records|Hydra Head]] often seems to have barely any connection to metal as understood by, say, [[VH1 Classic]] doc-makers. The continuity is less sonic but attitudinal: the penchant for [[Fascination with death|morbidity]] and darkness taken to a sometimes hokey degree; the somber clothing and the long hair; the harrowed, indecipherably [[growled vocals]]; the bombastically verbose lyrics/song titles/band names. It's that aesthetic rather than a way of riffing or a palette of guitar sounds that ties post-metal back to [[Judas Priest]] and [[Black Sabbath]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Grunge's Long Shadow|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/arts/music_box/2009/05/grunges_long_shadow.single.html#pagebreak_anchor_2|accessdate=2010-11-14|authorlink=Simon Reynolds|work=[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]}}</ref>}}\n\n[[File:Russian Circles - Madrid - 15 abril 2015 2.JPG|thumb|left|Many groups, including [[Russian Circles]], are [[instrumental]].]]\nPost-metal is therefore notoriously difficult to define.{{original research inline|date=September 2018}} ''[[Fact (UK magazine)|Fact]]'' writer Robin Jahdi notes that \"the best [[Neurosis (band)|Neurosis]] albums don't sound anything like the best offerings from [[Isis (band)|Isis]]\" and that the genre cannot be readily distinguished from doom metal, modern black metal, and [[progressive metal]], \"[taking] in all of these elements without being entirely any one of them\".<ref name=\"fact\">{{cite web | url=http://www.factmag.com/2015/06/24/40-best-post-metal/ | title=The 40 best post-metal records ever made | work=[[Fact (UK magazine)|Fact]] | date=June 24, 2015 | accessdate=November 11, 2017 | author=Jahdi, Robin}}</ref> Contemporary post-metal is often seen as combining \"elements of doom metal, sludge, and/or black metal with elements of post-rock and shoegaze\", being more \"peaceful\" than metal but retaining its dark theming and [[screaming (music)|harsh vocal style]].<ref name=\"steff\" /> As with post-rock, however, many bands are [[instrumental]] and when vocals are used, they often \"resemble [another] accompanying instrument\" rather than actual words.<ref name=\"steff\" /> Songs are typically long and employ [[crescendo]]s, gradually building upon repeated [[Theme (music)|theme]]s; [[Aaron Turner]] of Isis stated that \"the standard song format of [[Verse\u2013chorus form|verse-chorus-verse-chorus]] is something that has been done and redone, and it seems pointless to adhere to that structure when there are so many other avenues to explore\".<ref name=\"isisguitar\">{{cite magazine\n| last = Porosky | first = Pamela | url = http://www.guitarplayer.com/story.asp?storyCode=78 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160304072104/http://www.guitarplayer.com/story.asp?storyCode=78 | url-status = dead | archive-date = 2016-03-04 | title = Aaron Turner and Michael Gallagher interview | magazine = [[Guitar Player]] | accessdate = 2006-09-06}} {{dead link|date=November 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Aesthetic and culture===\nWhile Simon Reynolds locates the connection between post-metal and conventional metal in attitude and aesthetic over musical approach, others have emphasized differences in these very areas.{{failed verification|date=September 2018}} Noting the divergence from typical [[metal fashion]], ''[[The New York Times]]'' described a 2005 [[Pelican (band)|Pelican]] show at the [[Knitting Factory]] in [[New York City]]: \"Instead of long hair and all-black outfits, the crowd was displaying the trappings of brainy, slightly nerdy [[indie rock]].

It emerged in the 1990s through the work of bands such as [[Neurosis (band)|Neurosis]] and [[Godflesh]] who transformed metal [[texture (music)|texture]] through [[experimental music|experimental]] composition. Associated with and inspired by [[post-rock]] and [[post-hardcore]], the genre employs the darkness and intensity of [[extreme metal]] but emphasizes atmosphere, emotion, and even \"[[revelation]]\", drawing on a wide range of sources including [[ambient music|ambient]], [[noise music|noise]], [[psychedelic music|psychedelic]], [[progressive music|progressive]], and [[classical music]] to develop an expansive but introspective sound. Post-metal songs are typically long, with loose and layered structures that discard the [[verse\u2013chorus form]] in favor of [[crescendo]]s and repeating [[Theme (music)|theme]]s. The sound centres on guitars and drums; any vocals are usually [[screaming (music)|screamed]] or [[death growl|growled]] and resemble an additional instrument.\n\nPost-metal is closely related to [[avant-garde metal]] and has also been associated with [[sludge metal]], [[drone metal]], [[progressive metal]], and [[industrial metal]]. Alternative names that have been used to describe the genre include '''art metal'''<ref name=\"nyt\" /> and '''metalgaze''',<ref name=\"earles\">{{cite book|last1=Earles|first1=Andrew|title=Gimme Indie Rock|date=2014|publisher=Voyageur|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=D_eKBAAAQBAJ&pg=PA145&lpg=PA145&dq=%22metal-gaze%22+%22post-metal%22&source=bl&ots=pi5if_RwpI&sig=0C13pCbVNJGIIPlgqvoVYB_3Kyk&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwj8nuil6KPMAhWG6xoKHf1jACs4ChDoAQgbMAA#v=onepage&q=%22metal-gaze%22%20%22post-metal%22&f=false|accessdate=15 July 2016}}</ref> highlighting its connection to [[art music]] and [[shoegazing]], respectively.

In 1997, Turner co-founded [[Isis (band)|Isis]], a band which became central to an increasingly recognizable post-metal movement. In particular, their 2002 sophomore album ''[[Oceanic (Isis album)|Oceanic]]'' \u2013 which showcased \"buzzing washes of multilayered sound that ebbed and flowed in intensity\", combining the \"barbed guitars\" and \"[[shouted vocals]]\" of post-hardcore with \"meandering, psychedelic progressions\"<ref name=\"bandcamp\"/> \u2013 has become regarded as a classic of the genre.<ref name=\"fact\" /> At the same time, Hydra Head signed further prominent bands, releasing the early records of [[Pelican (band)|Pelican]] and [[Jesu (band)|Jesu]].<ref name=\"nyt\" /> While Pelican are an [[instrumental music|instrumental]] quartet inspired as much by Neurosis and Godflesh as by Mogwai, Jesu was formed by Justin Broadrick after the breakup of Godflesh to explore \"ambient guitar compositions\", embracing [[shoegazing]] and [[slowcore]] influences.<ref name=\"bandcamp\"/>\n\nAlongside shoegazing, [[black metal]] began to transform post-metal as it \"spread beyond Scandinavia to infect the global underground\".<ref name=\"bandcamp\"/> Many bands employ the \"speed and ferocity\" of black metal in \"contrast to slower, more ethereal compositions\". This approach was pioneered by [[Agalloch]], who formed in 1995 and also employed elements of doom metal, [[progressive rock]], [[folk music]], and post-hardcore.<ref name=\"bandcamp\"/> [[Wolves in the Throne Room]], who became a significant act for American black metal by the release of their 2007 sophomore album ''[[Two Hunters]]'', were also inspired by Neurosis in combining \"ambience and violence\" to craft deeply melancholic music.<ref name=\"bandcamp\"/>\n\nWhile all post-metal pioneers except Broadrick are American, the genre soon spread internationally. In particular, the Japanese band [[Boris (band)|Boris]], formed in 1992, \"have always embraced the spirit and vitality of the vibrant movement\" and some of their works, such as the 2005 albums ''[[Dronevil]]'' and ''[[Pink (Boris album)|Pink]]'', have become influential to it.<ref name=\"bandcamp\"/> Boris often employ elements of [[drone music]] and have collaborated with prominent drone metal band [[Sunn O)))]],<ref name=\"bandcamp\"/> who have also been associated with post-metal.<ref name=\"nyt\" /> Several European bands also gained prominence within the genre, including [[Cult of Luna]] from Sweden, whose sound is indebted to Isis' ''Oceanic'',<ref name=\"steff\" /> [[Amenra]] from Belgium, who signed to Neurosis' label [[Neurot Recordings]] and rival their predecessors in sheer spiritual intensity,<ref name=\"amenra\">{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/features/amenra-mass-vi-album-stream-a8002161.html|title=AMENRA \u2013 MASS VI: Album Stream|last=Dedman|first=Remfry|newspaper=The Independent|date=16 October 2017|accessdate=16 October 2017}}</ref> and [[Year of No Light]] from France, who have transitioned from a sludge-oriented sound to monumental instrumental compositions, \"beautifully layered, but still dark and heavy\".<ref name=\"bandcamp\"/>\n\nAnother prominent instrumental band, [[Russian Circles]], was also strongly influenced by ''Oceanic''.<ref name=\"steff\" /> By contrast, [[True Widow]], whose sound is rooted as much in 1990s [[indie rock]] and [[psychedelic rock]] as in doom metal, offer a distinctive take on post-metal, most impactfully on the 2013's ''[[Circumambulation (album)|Circumambulation]]'', by employing \"male/female vocal interplay\" and showcasing \"vulnerability and restraint\".<ref name=\"bandcamp\"/> Meanwhile, the Melvins had made a direct mark on the sound they themselves inspired with the 2004 album ''[[Pigs of the Roman Empire]]'', a collaboration with [[dark ambient]] composer [[Lustmord]].<ref name=\"bandcamp\"/>\n\nGradually, post-metal as a genre has achieved major critical acclaim.<ref name=\"steff\" /> This was reinforced by the \"widely publicized\" success of [[Deafheaven]],<ref name=\"bandcamp\"/> whose sophomore album ''[[Sunbather (album)|Sunbather]]'' became one of the most celebrated releases of 2013.

[[Principal photography]] of the film began in September 2015 and she finished her part in December the same year. The film, which narrated the story of [[pehlwani]] [[amateur]] wrestler [[Mahavir Singh Phogat]] ([[Aamir Khan]]) who trains his two daughters [[Geeta Phogat|Geeta]] (Wasim) and [[Babita Kumari|Babita]] (Suhani Bhatnagar) to become India's first world class female wrestlers, received positive reviews from critics and emerged as the [[List of highest-grossing Indian films|highest-grossing Indian film]] of all time, earning more than {{INR|20 billion}} ({{US$|300&nbsp;million|long=no}}) worldwide.

This resulted in her being [[Internet troll|trolled]] online for having been \"un-[[Islam]]ic\" by acting in a film. In January 2017, a local news organisation published the news and photos of her meeting with Chief Minister [[Mehbooba Mufti]]. This resulted in further criticism and Wasim receiving death threats<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.dnaindia.com/india/report-is-will-kill-you-masked-men-threaten-dangal-actress-zaira-wasim-in-srinagar-2294455|title='Islamic State will kill you': Masked men threaten Dangal actress Zaira Wasim in Srinagar {{!}} Latest News & Updates at Daily News & Analysis|date=20 January 2017|work=dna|access-date=25 October 2017|language=en-US}}</ref> because Mufti had described Wasim as a \"Kashmiri [[role model]]\".

She posted a series of messages on her [[Instagram]] profile alleging that a man sitting behind her on the flight had caressed her neck while she was asleep. She also wrote that she had tried to record what the man was doing, but failed due to dim lights. The airline issued an apology on the issue and released a statement saying that a detailed investigation would be conducted. The accused, Vikas Sachdeva of [[Powai|Chandivli]] in Mumbai was subsequently arrested and charged under [[Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012|Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act]] (POCSO), given Wasim was a legal minor. The accused's wife claimed her husband had been resting when his leg accidentally touched Wasim and that he had apologised before getting off the plane at the Mumbai airport, which the actress had acknowledged.

[[Principal photography]] of the film began in September 2015 and she finished her part in December the same year. The film, which narrated the story of [[pehlwani]] [[amateur]] wrestler [[Mahavir Singh Phogat]] ([[Aamir Khan]]) who trains his two daughters [[Geeta Phogat|Geeta]] (Wasim) and [[Babita Kumari|Babita]] (Suhani Bhatnagar) to become India's first world class female wrestlers, received positive reviews from critics and emerged as the [[List of highest-grossing Indian films|highest-grossing Indian film]] of all time, earning more than {{INR|20 billion}} ({{US$|300&nbsp;million|long=no}}) worldwide. For her performance, Wasim received positive comments as well as several awards, including the [[National Film Award for Best Supporting Actress]] and a nomination for the [[Filmfare Award for Best Female Debut]].\n\nThe following year, Wasim found her breakthrough role in [[Advait Chandan]]'s directorial debut [[Secret Superstar]] (2017), a musical drama about the story of Insia Malik (Wasim), a 15-year-old teenager who aspires to be a singer. Co-starring with Aamir Khan, [[Meher Vij]], and [[Raj Arjun]], Wasim garnered critical acclaim for her performance and the film eventually emerged as her second consecutive release to earn over {{INRConvert|9|b}} worldwide, becoming the third highest-grossing Indian film (after Dangal and the 2015 film [[Bajrangi Bhaijaan]]) and the highest-grossing Indian film featuring a female protagonist. In addition to several other accolades for the film, Wasim won the [[Filmfare Critics Award for Best Actress]] and received her first nomination for the [[Filmfare Award for Best Actress|Filmfare Best Actress Award]].

This resulted in her being [[Internet troll|trolled]] online for having been \"un-[[Islam]]ic\" by acting in a film. In January 2017, a local news organisation published the news and photos of her meeting with Chief Minister [[Mehbooba Mufti]]. This resulted in further criticism and Wasim receiving death threats<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.dnaindia.com/india/report-is-will-kill-you-masked-men-threaten-dangal-actress-zaira-wasim-in-srinagar-2294455|title='Islamic State will kill you': Masked men threaten Dangal actress Zaira Wasim in Srinagar {{!}} Latest News & Updates at Daily News & Analysis|date=20 January 2017|work=dna|access-date=25 October 2017|language=en-US}}</ref> because Mufti had described Wasim as a \"Kashmiri [[role model]]\".

She posted a series of messages on her [[Instagram]] profile alleging that a man sitting behind her on the flight had caressed her neck while she was asleep. She also wrote that she had tried to record what the man was doing, but failed due to dim lights. The airline issued an apology on the issue and released a statement saying that a detailed investigation would be conducted. The accused, Vikas Sachdeva of [[Powai|Chandivli]] in Mumbai was subsequently arrested and charged under [[Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012|Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act]] (POCSO), given Wasim was a legal minor. The accused's wife claimed her husband had been resting when his leg accidentally touched Wasim and that he had apologised before getting off the plane at the Mumbai airport, which the actress had acknowledged.
