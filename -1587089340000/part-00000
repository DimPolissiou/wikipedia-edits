Pitt was founded as the '''Pittsburgh Academy''' in 1787 on the [[History of Pittsburgh#Gateway to the West (1763\u20131799)|edge of the American frontier]]. It developed and was renamed as '''Western University of Pennsylvania''' by a change to its charter in 1819. After surviving two devastating fires and various relocations within the area, the school moved to its current location in the [[Oakland (Pittsburgh)|Oakland]] neighborhood of the city; it was renamed as the University of Pittsburgh in 1908. Pitt was a private institution until 1966 when it became part of the [[Commonwealth System of Higher Education]].\n\nThe university is composed of 17 undergraduate and graduate schools and colleges at its [[Urban university|urban]] Pittsburgh campus, home to the university's central administration and 28,391 undergraduate, graduate, and professional students. The university also includes four undergraduate schools located at campuses within [[Western Pennsylvania]]: [[University of Pittsburgh at Bradford|Bradford]], [[University of Pittsburgh at Greensburg|Greensburg]], [[University of Pittsburgh at Johnstown|Johnstown]], and [[University of Pittsburgh at Titusville|Titusville]]. The 132-acre Pittsburgh campus has multiple contributing historic buildings of the [[Schenley Farms Historic District]], most notably its 42-story [[Gothic Revival architecture|Gothic revival]] centerpiece, the [[Cathedral of Learning]]. The campus is situated adjacent to the flagship medical facilities of its closely affiliated [[University of Pittsburgh Medical Center]] (UPMC) and its flagship hospital [[UPMC Presbyterian]] in on campus, as well as the [[Carnegie Museums of Pittsburgh]], [[Schenley Park]], and [[Carnegie Mellon University]].\n\nThe university has an annual operating budget of approximately $2 billion. This includes nearly $940 million in research and development expenditures as of 2017, the 16th-highest in the nation.<ref>https://ncsesdata.nsf.gov/profiles/site;jsessionid=519A925E61C6701A1CAB3D9DDC0EE0B8?method=rankingBySource&ds=herd</ref> A member of the [[Association of American Universities]], Pitt is the third-largest recipient of federally sponsored health research funding among U.S. universities in 2018 and it is a major recipient of research funding from the [[National Institutes of Health]].<ref name=\"NIHrank\"/> It is the second-largest non-government employer in the Pittsburgh region behind UPMC.

It is the oldest continuously chartered institution of learning in the U.S. west of the [[Allegheny Mountains]].{{sfn|Alberts|1986|p=453}} The school began as a preparatory school, presumably in a [[Log Cabin (University of Pittsburgh)|log cabin]], possibly as early as 1770<ref name=\"Annual catalog of the Western University of Pennsylvania, Year Ending 1905\"/> in Western Pennsylvania, then a frontier.<ref name=\"Early Schools\"/> Brackenridge obtained a charter for the school from the state legislature of the [[Pennsylvania|Commonwealth of Pennsylvania]] on February 28, 1787, just ten weeks before the opening of the [[Philadelphia Convention|Constitutional Convention]] in Philadelphia.<ref name=\"The history of Pittsburgh: its rise and progress\"/><ref name=\"Through One Hundred and Fifty Years: The University of Pittsburgh\"/> A brick building was erected in 1790 on the south side of Third Street and Cherry Alley for the Pittsburgh Academy.<ref name=\"Mark Nordenberg Issues A University Update on the Economy and Our Community\"/>{{sfn|Alberts|1986}} The small two-story brick building, with a gable facing the alley, contained three rooms: one below and two above.<ref name=\"Rev.

The school was named the '''Western University of Pennsylvania''', or WUP, and was intended to be the western sister institution to the [[University of Pennsylvania]] in [[Philadelphia]].<ref name=\"Through One Hundred and Fifty Years: The University of Pittsburgh\"/><ref name=\"The Celebration of the One Hundred and Twenty-Fifth Anniversary: History of the University\"/> By 1830, WUP had moved into a new three-story, freestone-fronted building, with Ionic columns and a cupola, near its original buildings fronting the south side of Third Street, between Smithfield Street and Cherry Alley in downtown Pittsburgh. By the 1830s, the university faced severe financial pressure to abandon its traditional liberal education in favor of the [[Pennsylvania General Assembly|state legislature's]] desire for it to provide more vocational training. The decision to remain committed to liberal education nearly killed the university, but it persevered despite its abandonment by the city and state.{{sfn|Alberts|1986|p=17}} It was also during this era that the founder of [[Mellon Bank]], [[Thomas Mellon]] (Class of 1837), graduated and later taught at WUP.<ref name=\"Students celebrate Fall Fest\" /><ref name=\"Mark Nordenberg Issues A University Update on the Economy and Our Community\"/>{{sfn|Alberts|1986}}\n\nThe university's buildings, along with most of its records and files, were destroyed in the [[Great Fire of Pittsburgh|Great Fire of 1845]] that wiped out 20 square blocks of Pittsburgh. Classes were temporarily held in [[Trinity Cathedral (Pittsburgh)|Trinity Church]] until a new building was constructed on Duquesne Way (on what was the site of the former [[Horne's]] department store). Only four years later, in 1849, this building also was destroyed by fire. Due to the catastrophic nature of these fires, operations were suspended for a few years to allow the university time to regroup and rebuild. By 1854, WUP had erected a new building on the corner of Ross and Diamond (now Forbes Avenue) streets (site of the present day [[Pittsburgh City-County Building|City-County building]]) and classes resumed in 1855. It is during this era, in 1867, that [[Samuel Pierpont Langley]], astronomer, inventor, aviation pioneer and future Secretary of the [[Smithsonian Institution]], was chosen as director of the [[Allegheny Observatory]] that was donated to WUP in 1865. Langley was professor of astronomy and physics and remained at WUP until 1891, when he was succeeded by another prominent astronomer, [[James Edward Keeler|James Keeler]]. Growing quickly during this period, WUP outgrew its downtown facilities and the university moved its campus to [[Allegheny, Pennsylvania|Allegheny City]] (present-day [[Northside (Pittsburgh)|North Side]]).<ref name=\"Students celebrate Fall Fest\" /><ref name=\"Mark Nordenberg Issues A University Update on the Economy and Our Community\"/>{{sfn|Alberts|1986}}\n\nThe university eventually found itself on a {{convert|10|acre|ha|adj=on}} site on the North Side's [[Observatory Hill (Pittsburgh)|Observatory Hill]] at the location of its [[Allegheny Observatory]]. There, it constructed two new buildings, Science Hall and Main Hall, that were occupied by 1889 and 1890 respectively. During this era, the first collegiate football team was formed at Pitt in 1889. In 1892, the Western Pennsylvania Medical College was amalgamated into the university. By 1893, the university had graduated its first African-American, William Dammond.<ref name=\"Pitt History \u2013 1893: William Hunter Dammond\"/> In 1895 WUP established its School of Law, and [[Andrew Carnegie]] and [[George Westinghouse]] were elected to the board of trustees, where they joined [[Andrew Mellon]], who had been elected in 1894. The Pittsburgh College of Pharmacy and Pittsburgh Dental School also joined the university in 1896. In 1898, the first women, sisters Margaret and Stella Stein, graduated from the university.<ref name=\"Pitt History \u2013 1898: Margaret and Stella Stein\"/> During this period, University engineering professor [[Reginald Fessenden]] was conducting pioneering work in radio broadcasting. By 1904, playing at [[Exposition Park (Pittsburgh)|Exposition Park]], the university had its first undefeated football team.<ref name=\"Students celebrate Fall Fest\" /><ref name=\"Mark Nordenberg Issues A University Update on the Economy and Our Community\"/>{{sfn|Alberts|1986}}<ref name=\"Pitt History \u2013 1906: Reginald Fessenden\"/>\n\n===A new name and home===\n[[File:Cathedral of Learning stitch 1.jpg|thumb|The [[Cathedral of Learning]], the centerpiece of Pitt's campus and the tallest educational building in the Western Hemisphere]]\nCiting a need to avoid confusion, distinguish itself from the University of Pennsylvania, and return to its roots by identifying itself with the city, the Western University of Pennsylvania, by act of the state legislature, was renamed the '''University of Pittsburgh''' in the summer of 1908. During this time, the university had also outgrown its accommodations on what is now the North Side of Pittsburgh and its departments had been scattered throughout the city for years. To consolidate all of its components on one campus, WUP bought {{convert|43|acre|m2}} of land in December 1907 in what is now the Oakland neighborhood of Pittsburgh and began relocating departments there by 1909.<ref name=\"The Owl\"/> The initial campus plan for the new location centered on the winning submission from a national architectural contest that incorporated a Greek Acropolis design by [[Henry Hornbostel]] for 30 buildings.{{sfn|Alberts|1986|pp=60\u201361}} However, due to financial and other constraints, only four of the buildings were constructed in this style, of which only [[Thaw Hall]] remains today. In the fall of 1909, the university became the first college to adopt the [[Panthers of Pittsburgh|panther]] as its mascot.<ref name=\"The Panther\"/> It was also during this period that the university, led by Chancellor [[Samuel McCormick]], again held off pressures to abandon the school's commitment to liberal education in favor of more technical-based training. During his administration, McCormick also led the university into a new level of national recognition, expansion, and growth, as well as beginning institutional support of athletics.{{sfn|Alberts|1986|pp=60\u201361}}\n\nIn the 1920s, new university chancellor [[John Gabbert Bowman]] declared that he had a vision for a centerpiece \"tall building\" for the university. The {{convert|14|acre}} Frick Acres property in Oakland was soon purchased and plans for the campus shifted focus from the hillside to a neo-[[Gothic Revival architecture|Gothic Revival]] plan that today comprises the [[Cathedral of Learning]], [[Heinz Memorial Chapel]], [[Stephen Foster Memorial]], and [[Clapp Hall]] buildings. By 1925, Bowman had settled on a design by [[Charles Klauder]] for the \"tall building\": an attention-getting {{convert|535|ft|m|adj=on}} tower whose great height, with open spaces all around, would suggest the \"character that ought to be in an educated man.\" The building's \"parallel lines going up and up...would express courage [and] fearlessness\" and it would \"unify Pittsburgh into a community conscious of its character.\" The Cathedral is \"cut off\" flat at the top to suggest that its lines, like education, have no ending. The building was financed by donors and by a campaign to collect dimes from local school children. Bowman was a persuasive leader and although the [[Great Depression]] intervened, the Cathedral of Learning, on which construction was begun in 1926, began hosting classes in 1931 and was formally dedicated in 1937. Today, it remains the second tallest university building in the world and contains an equally impressive interior highlighted by a half-acre (2,000 m\u00b2) Gothic hall Commons Room with {{convert|52|ft|m|adj=on}} tall arches currently surrounded by 31&nbsp;[[Nationality Rooms]]. Seven more Nationality Rooms are in the making.<ref name=\"The Nationality Rooms - rooms in planning\"/>\n\n===Development of the polio vaccine===\n[[File:SalkatPitt.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Jonas Salk]] developed the first polio vaccine at the University of Pittsburgh.]]\nIn the early 20th century, epidemics of [[poliomyelitis|polio]] began to hit the United States and other industrialized countries. As hospitals filled with patients in [[Negative pressure ventilator|iron lung]]s, and tens of thousands were left disabled, the fear of polio grew, leading to the closing of many public facilities. Meanwhile, [[Jonas Salk|Dr. Jonas Salk]] had set up the University of Pittsburgh's Virus Research Lab in the basement of what is now [[Salk Hall]]. By 1951, Salk and his team had begun immunization experiments in monkeys using dead polio virus. Soon, however, Salk began to test inoculations in paralyzed polio patients and by 1953 human trials among the general population were initiated. By the spring of the following year, the largest controlled field trials in medical history were underway, and by 1955 the [[polio vaccine|vaccine]] developed by Salk and his researchers was declared effective. By 1962, Salk's vaccine had reduced the incidence of polio in the United States by 95 percent. The breakthroughs in immunology and vaccine development at Pitt by Salk and his team are considered one of the most significant scientific and medical achievements in history.<ref name=\"Remembering Polio: Celebrating the 50th Anniversary of the Salk Polio Vaccine\"/><ref name=\"The Shot Heard 'Round the World\"/>\n\n===State relations to present day===\nIn 1966, Pitt was designated by [[Pennsylvania]] as a [[Commonwealth System of Higher Education|state-related]] university. As such, Pitt receives public funds ($154.3&nbsp;million in fiscal year 2016) covering about 7% of its operating budget,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cfo.pitt.edu/documents/FinancialReportFY2016.pdf|title=University of Pittsburgh Financial Report Fiscal Year 2016|publisher=}}</ref> and offers reduced tuition to Pennsylvania residents. Pitt retains independent control, but is typically categorized as a public university. Upon affiliation with the state, subsidized tuition led to a massive influx of new students and rapid expansion of Pitt's size and scope. In the 1970s, Pitt's football team returned to greatness with a national championship season in 1976 led by [[Pro Football Hall of Fame|Hall of Fame]] running back [[Tony Dorsett]] and continued success in the 1980s with players such as [[Pro Football Hall of Fame|Hall of Fame]] quarterback [[Dan Marino]]. In the 1980s, significant medical research in the field of [[organ transplantation]] was conducted by [[Thomas Starzl]], establishing Pitt as the world leader in the field of organ transplantation. In 1991, chancellor [[Wesley Posvar]] retired after 24 years in office. His administration is best known for elimination of the university's debt from its 1960s financial crisis and for increasing the school's prestige and endowment. Under Posvar, Pitt's operating budget grew sevenfold to $630&nbsp;million and its endowment tripled to $257&nbsp;million.<ref name=\"pitt\"/>\n\n[[Mark Nordenberg]] was chancellor of the university from 1995 to 2014 and led Pitt through a period of substantial progress, including a $2-billion capital-raising campaign that is over three quarters of the way toward achieving its goal<ref name=\"Pitt Giving: Office of Institutional Advancement\"/> and a $1-billion 12-year facilities plan.<ref name=\"University of Pittsburgh Announces 12-Year Facilities Plan To Support Programmatic Direction\"/> Major initiatives and events that have occurred during his tenure include the construction of the [[Petersen Events Center]], a major expansion of on-campus housing, the growth of the [[University of Pittsburgh Medical Center]] and the restructuring of its relationship with the university, and a series of [[2012 University of Pittsburgh bomb threats|disruptive bomb threats]] that occurred in 2012.\n\n[[Patrick D.

Pitt was founded as the '''Pittsburgh Academy''' in 1787 on the [[History of Pittsburgh#Gateway to the West (1763\u20131799)|edge of the American frontier]]. It developed and was renamed as '''Western University of Pennsylvania''' by a change to its charter in 1819. After surviving two devastating fires and various relocations within the area, the school moved to its current location in the [[Oakland (Pittsburgh)|Oakland]] neighborhood of the city; it was renamed as the University of Pittsburgh in 1908. Pitt was a private institution until 1966 when it became part of the [[Commonwealth System of Higher Education]].\n\nThe university is composed of 17 undergraduate and graduate schools and colleges at its [[Urban university|urban]] Pittsburgh campus, home to the university's central administration and 28,391 undergraduate, graduate, and professional students. The university also includes four undergraduate schools located at campuses within [[Western Pennsylvania]]: [[University of Pittsburgh at Bradford|Bradford]], [[University of Pittsburgh at Greensburg|Greensburg]], [[University of Pittsburgh at Johnstown|Johnstown]], and [[University of Pittsburgh at Titusville|Titusville]]. The 132-acre Pittsburgh campus has multiple contributing historic buildings of the [[Schenley Farms Historic District]], most notably its 42-story [[Gothic Revival architecture|Gothic revival]] centerpiece, the [[Cathedral of Learning]]. The campus is situated adjacent to the flagship medical facilities of its closely affiliated [[University of Pittsburgh Medical Center]] (UPMC) and its flagship hospital [[UPMC Presbyterian]] in on campus, as well as the [[Carnegie Museums of Pittsburgh]], [[Schenley Park]], and [[Carnegie Mellon University]].\n\nThe university has an annual operating budget of approximately $2 billion. This includes nearly $940 million in research and development expenditures as of 2017, the 16th-highest in the nation.<ref>https://ncsesdata.nsf.gov/profiles/site;jsessionid=519A925E61C6701A1CAB3D9DDC0EE0B8?method=rankingBySource&ds=herd</ref> A member of the [[Association of American Universities]], Pitt is the third-largest recipient of federally sponsored health research funding among U.S. universities in 2018 and it is a major recipient of research funding from the [[National Institutes of Health]].<ref name=\"NIHrank\"/> It is the second-largest non-government employer in the Pittsburgh region behind UPMC.

Pitt's varsity athletic teams, collectively known as the [[Pittsburgh Panthers]], compete in [[Division I (NCAA)|Division I]] of the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]], primarily as members of the [[Atlantic Coast Conference]].\n\n==History==\n[[File:Hugh Henry Brackenridge.jpg|thumb|upright|right|[[Hugh Henry Brackenridge]], founder of Pittsburgh Academy, the precursor to the University of Pittsburgh]]\n{{Main|History of the University of Pittsburgh}}\n\n===Founding===\nFounded by [[Hugh Henry Brackenridge]] as '''Pittsburgh Academy''' in 1787, the University of Pittsburgh is one of the few universities and colleges established in the 18th century in the United States. It is the oldest continuously chartered institution of learning in the U.S. west of the [[Allegheny Mountains]].{{sfn|Alberts|1986|p=453}} The school began as a preparatory school, presumably in a [[Log Cabin (University of Pittsburgh)|log cabin]], possibly as early as 1770<ref name=\"Annual catalog of the Western University of Pennsylvania, Year Ending 1905\"/> in Western Pennsylvania, then a frontier.<ref name=\"Early Schools\"/> Brackenridge obtained a charter for the school from the state legislature of the [[Pennsylvania|Commonwealth of Pennsylvania]] on February 28, 1787, just ten weeks before the opening of the [[Philadelphia Convention|Constitutional Convention]] in Philadelphia.<ref name=\"The history of Pittsburgh: its rise and progress\"/><ref name=\"Through One Hundred and Fifty Years: The University of Pittsburgh\"/> A brick building was erected in 1790 on the south side of Third Street and Cherry Alley for the Pittsburgh Academy.<ref name=\"Mark Nordenberg Issues A University Update on the Economy and Our Community\"/>{{sfn|Alberts|1986}} The small two-story brick building, with a gable facing the alley, contained three rooms: one below and two above.<ref name=\"Rev. John Taylor: the first rector of Trinity Episcopal Church of Pittsburgh and his commonplace book\"/>\n\n===Western University of Pennsylvania===\n[[File:Pitt1833.jpg|thumb|The university in 1833 at its location on 3rd Avenue in downtown Pittsburgh]]\nWithin a short period, more advanced education in the area was needed, so in 1819 the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania amended the school's 1787 charter to confer university status. The school was named the '''Western University of Pennsylvania''', or WUP, and was intended to be the western sister institution to the [[University of Pennsylvania]] in [[Philadelphia]].<ref name=\"Through One Hundred and Fifty Years: The University of Pittsburgh\"/><ref name=\"The Celebration of the One Hundred and Twenty-Fifth Anniversary: History of the University\"/> By 1830, WUP had moved into a new three-story, freestone-fronted building, with Ionic columns and a cupola, near its original buildings fronting the south side of Third Street, between Smithfield Street and Cherry Alley in downtown Pittsburgh. By the 1830s, the university faced severe financial pressure to abandon its traditional liberal education in favor of the [[Pennsylvania General Assembly|state legislature's]] desire for it to provide more vocational training. The decision to remain committed to liberal education nearly killed the university, but it persevered despite its abandonment by the city and state.{{sfn|Alberts|1986|p=17}} It was also during this era that the founder of [[Mellon Bank]], [[Thomas Mellon]] (Class of 1837), graduated and later taught at WUP.<ref name=\"Students celebrate Fall Fest\" /><ref name=\"Mark Nordenberg Issues A University Update on the Economy and Our Community\"/>{{sfn|Alberts|1986}}\n\nThe university's buildings, along with most of its records and files, were destroyed in the [[Great Fire of Pittsburgh|Great Fire of 1845]] that wiped out 20 square blocks of Pittsburgh. Classes were temporarily held in [[Trinity Cathedral (Pittsburgh)|Trinity Church]] until a new building was constructed on Duquesne Way (on what was the site of the former [[Horne's]] department store). Only four years later, in 1849, this building also was destroyed by fire. Due to the catastrophic nature of these fires, operations were suspended for a few years to allow the university time to regroup and rebuild. By 1854, WUP had erected a new building on the corner of Ross and Diamond (now Forbes Avenue) streets (site of the present day [[Pittsburgh City-County Building|City-County building]]) and classes resumed in 1855. It is during this era, in 1867, that [[Samuel Pierpont Langley]], astronomer, inventor, aviation pioneer and future Secretary of the [[Smithsonian Institution]], was chosen as director of the [[Allegheny Observatory]] that was donated to WUP in 1865. Langley was professor of astronomy and physics and remained at WUP until 1891, when he was succeeded by another prominent astronomer, [[James Edward Keeler|James Keeler]]. Growing quickly during this period, WUP outgrew its downtown facilities and the university moved its campus to [[Allegheny, Pennsylvania|Allegheny City]] (present-day [[Northside (Pittsburgh)|North Side]]).<ref name=\"Students celebrate Fall Fest\" /><ref name=\"Mark Nordenberg Issues A University Update on the Economy and Our Community\"/>{{sfn|Alberts|1986}}\n\nThe university eventually found itself on a {{convert|10|acre|ha|adj=on}} site on the North Side's [[Observatory Hill (Pittsburgh)|Observatory Hill]] at the location of its [[Allegheny Observatory]]. There, it constructed two new buildings, Science Hall and Main Hall, that were occupied by 1889 and 1890 respectively. During this era, the first collegiate football team was formed at Pitt in 1889. In 1892, the Western Pennsylvania Medical College was amalgamated into the university. By 1893, the university had graduated its first African-American, William Dammond.<ref name=\"Pitt History \u2013 1893: William Hunter Dammond\"/> In 1895 WUP established its School of Law, and [[Andrew Carnegie]] and [[George Westinghouse]] were elected to the board of trustees, where they joined [[Andrew Mellon]], who had been elected in 1894. The Pittsburgh College of Pharmacy and Pittsburgh Dental School also joined the university in 1896. In 1898, the first women, sisters Margaret and Stella Stein, graduated from the university.<ref name=\"Pitt History \u2013 1898: Margaret and Stella Stein\"/> During this period, University engineering professor [[Reginald Fessenden]] was conducting pioneering work in radio broadcasting. By 1904, playing at [[Exposition Park (Pittsburgh)|Exposition Park]], the university had its first undefeated football team.<ref name=\"Students celebrate Fall Fest\" /><ref name=\"Mark Nordenberg Issues A University Update on the Economy and Our Community\"/>{{sfn|Alberts|1986}}<ref name=\"Pitt History \u2013 1906: Reginald Fessenden\"/>\n\n===A new name and home===\n[[File:Cathedral of Learning stitch 1.jpg|thumb|The [[Cathedral of Learning]], the centerpiece of Pitt's campus and the tallest educational building in the Western Hemisphere]]\nCiting a need to avoid confusion, distinguish itself from the University of Pennsylvania, and return to its roots by identifying itself with the city, the Western University of Pennsylvania, by act of the state legislature, was renamed the '''University of Pittsburgh''' in the summer of 1908. During this time, the university had also outgrown its accommodations on what is now the North Side of Pittsburgh and its departments had been scattered throughout the city for years. To consolidate all of its components on one campus, WUP bought {{convert|43|acre|m2}} of land in December 1907 in what is now the Oakland neighborhood of Pittsburgh and began relocating departments there by 1909.<ref name=\"The Owl\"/> The initial campus plan for the new location centered on the winning submission from a national architectural contest that incorporated a Greek Acropolis design by [[Henry Hornbostel]] for 30 buildings.{{sfn|Alberts|1986|pp=60\u201361}} However, due to financial and other constraints, only four of the buildings were constructed in this style, of which only [[Thaw Hall]] remains today. In the fall of 1909, the university became the first college to adopt the [[Panthers of Pittsburgh|panther]] as its mascot.<ref name=\"The Panther\"/> It was also during this period that the university, led by Chancellor [[Samuel McCormick]], again held off pressures to abandon the school's commitment to liberal education in favor of more technical-based training. During his administration, McCormick also led the university into a new level of national recognition, expansion, and growth, as well as beginning institutional support of athletics.{{sfn|Alberts|1986|pp=60\u201361}}\n\nIn the 1920s, new university chancellor [[John Gabbert Bowman]] declared that he had a vision for a centerpiece \"tall building\" for the university. The {{convert|14|acre}} Frick Acres property in Oakland was soon purchased and plans for the campus shifted focus from the hillside to a neo-[[Gothic Revival architecture|Gothic Revival]] plan that today comprises the [[Cathedral of Learning]], [[Heinz Memorial Chapel]], [[Stephen Foster Memorial]], and [[Clapp Hall]] buildings. By 1925, Bowman had settled on a design by [[Charles Klauder]] for the \"tall building\": an attention-getting {{convert|535|ft|m|adj=on}} tower whose great height, with open spaces all around, would suggest the \"character that ought to be in an educated man.\" The building's \"parallel lines going up and up...would express courage [and] fearlessness\" and it would \"unify Pittsburgh into a community conscious of its character.\" The Cathedral is \"cut off\" flat at the top to suggest that its lines, like education, have no ending. The building was financed by donors and by a campaign to collect dimes from local school children. Bowman was a persuasive leader and although the [[Great Depression]] intervened, the Cathedral of Learning, on which construction was begun in 1926, began hosting classes in 1931 and was formally dedicated in 1937. Today, it remains the second tallest university building in the world and contains an equally impressive interior highlighted by a half-acre (2,000 m\u00b2) Gothic hall Commons Room with {{convert|52|ft|m|adj=on}} tall arches currently surrounded by 31&nbsp;[[Nationality Rooms]]. Seven more Nationality Rooms are in the making.<ref name=\"The Nationality Rooms - rooms in planning\"/>\n\n===Development of the polio vaccine===\n[[File:SalkatPitt.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Jonas Salk]] developed the first polio vaccine at the University of Pittsburgh.]]\nIn the early 20th century, epidemics of [[poliomyelitis|polio]] began to hit the United States and other industrialized countries. As hospitals filled with patients in [[Negative pressure ventilator|iron lung]]s, and tens of thousands were left disabled, the fear of polio grew, leading to the closing of many public facilities. Meanwhile, [[Jonas Salk|Dr. Jonas Salk]] had set up the University of Pittsburgh's Virus Research Lab in the basement of what is now [[Salk Hall]]. By 1951, Salk and his team had begun immunization experiments in monkeys using dead polio virus. Soon, however, Salk began to test inoculations in paralyzed polio patients and by 1953 human trials among the general population were initiated. By the spring of the following year, the largest controlled field trials in medical history were underway, and by 1955 the [[polio vaccine|vaccine]] developed by Salk and his researchers was declared effective. By 1962, Salk's vaccine had reduced the incidence of polio in the United States by 95 percent. The breakthroughs in immunology and vaccine development at Pitt by Salk and his team are considered one of the most significant scientific and medical achievements in history.<ref name=\"Remembering Polio: Celebrating the 50th Anniversary of the Salk Polio Vaccine\"/><ref name=\"The Shot Heard 'Round the World\"/>\n\n===State relations to present day===\nIn 1966, Pitt was designated by [[Pennsylvania]] as a [[Commonwealth System of Higher Education|state-related]] university. As such, Pitt receives public funds ($154.3&nbsp;million in fiscal year 2016) covering about 7% of its operating budget,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cfo.pitt.edu/documents/FinancialReportFY2016.pdf|title=University of Pittsburgh Financial Report Fiscal Year 2016|publisher=}}</ref> and offers reduced tuition to Pennsylvania residents. Pitt retains independent control, but is typically categorized as a public university. Upon affiliation with the state, subsidized tuition led to a massive influx of new students and rapid expansion of Pitt's size and scope. In the 1970s, Pitt's football team returned to greatness with a national championship season in 1976 led by [[Pro Football Hall of Fame|Hall of Fame]] running back [[Tony Dorsett]] and continued success in the 1980s with players such as [[Pro Football Hall of Fame|Hall of Fame]] quarterback [[Dan Marino]]. In the 1980s, significant medical research in the field of [[organ transplantation]] was conducted by [[Thomas Starzl]], establishing Pitt as the world leader in the field of organ transplantation. In 1991, chancellor [[Wesley Posvar]] retired after 24 years in office. His administration is best known for elimination of the university's debt from its 1960s financial crisis and for increasing the school's prestige and endowment. Under Posvar, Pitt's operating budget grew sevenfold to $630&nbsp;million and its endowment tripled to $257&nbsp;million.<ref name=\"pitt\"/>\n\n[[Mark Nordenberg]] was chancellor of the university from 1995 to 2014 and led Pitt through a period of substantial progress, including a $2-billion capital-raising campaign that is over three quarters of the way toward achieving its goal<ref name=\"Pitt Giving: Office of Institutional Advancement\"/> and a $1-billion 12-year facilities plan.<ref name=\"University of Pittsburgh Announces 12-Year Facilities Plan To Support Programmatic Direction\"/> Major initiatives and events that have occurred during his tenure include the construction of the [[Petersen Events Center]], a major expansion of on-campus housing, the growth of the [[University of Pittsburgh Medical Center]] and the restructuring of its relationship with the university, and a series of [[2012 University of Pittsburgh bomb threats|disruptive bomb threats]] that occurred in 2012.\n\n[[Patrick D.

Throughout much of the 19th century, it was listed among the top 10 U.S. cities by population, surpassed only by [[New Orleans]] and the older, established settlements of the United States eastern seaboard, as well as being the [[Largest cities in the United States by population by decade#1840|sixth-biggest city]] for a period spanning 1840 until 1860. Cincinnati was the first city founded after the [[American Revolution]], as well as the first major inland city in the country.\n\nCincinnati developed with fewer immigrants and less influence from Europe than East Coast cities in the same period. However, it received a significant number of German-speaking immigrants, who founded many of the city's cultural institutions.  By the end of the 19th century, with the shift from steamboats to railroads drawing off freight shipping, trade patterns had altered and Cincinnati's growth slowed considerably. The city was surpassed in population by other inland cities, particularly [[Chicago]], which developed based on strong commodity exploitation, economics, and the railroads, and [[St. Louis]], which for decades after the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] served as the gateway to westward migration.\n\nCincinnati is home to three major sports teams: the [[Cincinnati Reds]] of [[Major League Baseball]]; the [[Cincinnati Bengals]] of the [[National Football League]]; and  [[FC Cincinnati]] of [[Major League Soccer]].  The city's largest institution of higher education, the [[University of Cincinnati]], was founded in 1819 as a municipal college and is now ranked as one of the 50 largest in the United States.<ref>{{cite web|last=Rieselman|first=Deborah|title=Brief history of University of Cincinnati|url=http://magazine.uc.edu/editors_picks/fun/briefhistory.html|work=UC Magazine|publisher=University of Cincinnati University Relations|accessdate=February 12, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170219091343/http://magazine.uc.edu/editors_picks/fun/briefhistory.html|archive-date=February 19, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> Cincinnati is home to historic architecture with many structures in the urban core having remained intact for 200 years.

Most of Cincinnati's longtime residents have kinships rooted throughout the Ohio-Kentucky-Indiana [[Tri-state area|tristate]] and deeper.  The first [[Methodism|Methodist class]] came about in 1798, city residents for years already inspired by the Methodist circuit preachers; among Methodist institutes were [[The Christ Hospital]] as well as projects of the [[Nast Trinity United Methodist Church|German Methodist Church]].\n\n[[File:The Belle of Louisville docks next to the Natchez in Cincinnati for Tall Stacks 2006.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.35|[[Tall Stacks]], held every three or four years between 1988 and 2006, celebrated the city's [[riverboat]] heritage.]]\n\nCincinnati, being on the heartland plain, depended on trade with the slave states south of the Ohio River at a time when thousands of black people were settling in the free state of Ohio. Most of them came after the Civil War, and were from Kentucky and Virginia with many of them fugitives who had sought freedom and work in the North.  In the antebellum years, the majority of native-born whites in the city came from northern states, primarily [[Pennsylvania]].<ref>Taylor (2005), ''Frontiers of Freedom,'' pp. 20\u201321</ref>   Though 57 percent of whites migrated from free states, 26 percent were from southern states and they retained their cultural support for slavery. This quickly led to tensions between pro-slavery residents and those in favor of [[abolitionism]] and lifting restrictions on [[free people of color]], as codified in the \"Black Code\" of 1804.<ref name=Aaron1992/>\n\nGermans were among the earliest newcomers, migrating from Pennsylvania and the backcountry of Virginia and Tennessee.  General [[David Ziegler]] succeeded General St. Clair in command at [[Fort Washington (Cincinnati, Ohio)|Fort Washington]].  After the conclusion of the [[Northwest Indian War]] and removal of Native Americans to the west, he was elected as Cincinnati's first town president (equivalent to a mayor) in 1802.{{sfn|Greve|1904|p=440|ps=: \"This explains a common confusion of ideas as to the first mayor of Cincinnati.

Prior to 1924, City council members were elected through a system of [[Ward (politics)|wards]].  The ward system was subject to corruption due to partisan rule. From the 1880s to the 1920s, the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] dominated city politics, with the [[political machine]] of  George B. [[George B. Cox|\"Boss\" Cox]] exerting control.\n\nA reform movement arose in 1923, led by another Republican, [[Murray Seasongood]]. Seasongood founded the Charter Committee, which used ballot initiatives in 1924 to replace the ward system with the current at-large system. They gained approval by voters for a [[council\u2013manager government]] form of government, in which the smaller council (compared to the number of previous ward representatives) hires a professional manager to operate daily affairs of the city.  From 1924 to 1957, the council was elected by [[proportional representation]] and single transfer voting (STV). Starting with Ashtabula in 1915, several major cities in Ohio adopted this electoral system, which had the practical effect of reducing ward boss and political party power. For that reason, such groups opposed it.\n\nIn an effort to overturn the charter that provided for proportional representation, opponents in 1957 fanned fears of black political power, at a time of increasing civil rights activism.<ref name=\"amy\">[https://www.mtholyoke.edu/acad/polit/damy/articles/Brief%20History%20of%20PR.htm Douglas J.

Residents of Cincinnati played a major role in [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionism]]. Many [[fugitive slave]]s used the Ohio at Cincinnati to escape to the North. Cincinnati had numerous stations on the Underground Railroad, but there were also runaway slave catchers active in the city, who put escaping slaves at risk of recapture.\n\nGiven its southern Ohio location, Cincinnati had also attracted settlers from the Upper South, who traveled along the Ohio River into the territory. Tensions between abolitionists and slavery supporters broke out in repeated violence, with whites attacking blacks in 1829.

Throughout much of the 19th century, it was listed among the top 10 U.S. cities by population, surpassed only by [[New Orleans]] and the older, established settlements of the United States eastern seaboard, as well as being the [[Largest cities in the United States by population by decade#1840|sixth-biggest city]] for a period spanning 1840 until 1860. Cincinnati was the first city founded after the [[American Revolution]], as well as the first major inland city in the country.\n\nCincinnati developed with fewer immigrants and less influence from Europe than East Coast cities in the same period. However, it received a significant number of German-speaking immigrants, who founded many of the city's cultural institutions.  By the end of the 19th century, with the shift from steamboats to railroads drawing off freight shipping, trade patterns had altered and Cincinnati's growth slowed considerably. The city was surpassed in population by other inland cities, particularly [[Chicago]], which developed based on strong commodity exploitation, economics, and the railroads, and [[St. Louis]], which for decades after the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] served as the gateway to westward migration.\n\nCincinnati is home to three major sports teams: the [[Cincinnati Reds]] of [[Major League Baseball]]; the [[Cincinnati Bengals]] of the [[National Football League]]; and  [[FC Cincinnati]] of [[Major League Soccer]].  The city's largest institution of higher education, the [[University of Cincinnati]], was founded in 1819 as a municipal college and is now ranked as one of the 50 largest in the United States.<ref>{{cite web|last=Rieselman|first=Deborah|title=Brief history of University of Cincinnati|url=http://magazine.uc.edu/editors_picks/fun/briefhistory.html|work=UC Magazine|publisher=University of Cincinnati University Relations|accessdate=February 12, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170219091343/http://magazine.uc.edu/editors_picks/fun/briefhistory.html|archive-date=February 19, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> Cincinnati is home to historic architecture with many structures in the urban core having remained intact for 200 years.

Most of Cincinnati's longtime residents have kinships rooted throughout the Ohio-Kentucky-Indiana [[Tri-state area|tristate]] and deeper.  The first [[Methodism|Methodist class]] came about in 1798, city residents for years already inspired by the Methodist circuit preachers; among Methodist institutes were [[The Christ Hospital]] as well as projects of the [[Nast Trinity United Methodist Church|German Methodist Church]].\n\n[[File:The Belle of Louisville docks next to the Natchez in Cincinnati for Tall Stacks 2006.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.35|[[Tall Stacks]], held every three or four years between 1988 and 2006, celebrated the city's [[riverboat]] heritage.]]\n\nCincinnati, being on the heartland plain, depended on trade with the slave states south of the Ohio River at a time when thousands of black people were settling in the free state of Ohio. Most of them came after the Civil War, and were from Kentucky and Virginia with many of them fugitives who had sought freedom and work in the North.  In the antebellum years, the majority of native-born whites in the city came from northern states, primarily [[Pennsylvania]].<ref>Taylor (2005), ''Frontiers of Freedom,'' pp. 20\u201321</ref>   Though 57 percent of whites migrated from free states, 26 percent were from southern states and they retained their cultural support for slavery. This quickly led to tensions between pro-slavery residents and those in favor of [[abolitionism]] and lifting restrictions on [[free people of color]], as codified in the \"Black Code\" of 1804.<ref name=Aaron1992/>\n\nGermans were among the earliest newcomers, migrating from Pennsylvania and the backcountry of Virginia and Tennessee.  General [[David Ziegler]] succeeded General St. Clair in command at [[Fort Washington (Cincinnati, Ohio)|Fort Washington]].  After the conclusion of the [[Northwest Indian War]] and removal of Native Americans to the west, he was elected as Cincinnati's first town president (equivalent to a mayor) in 1802.{{sfn|Greve|1904|p=440|ps=: \"This explains a common confusion of ideas as to the first mayor of Cincinnati.

Prior to 1924, City council members were elected through a system of [[Ward (politics)|wards]].  The ward system was subject to corruption due to partisan rule. From the 1880s to the 1920s, the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] dominated city politics, with the [[political machine]] of  George B. [[George B. Cox|\"Boss\" Cox]] exerting control.\n\nA reform movement arose in 1923, led by another Republican, [[Murray Seasongood]]. Seasongood founded the Charter Committee, which used ballot initiatives in 1924 to replace the ward system with the current at-large system. They gained approval by voters for a [[council\u2013manager government]] form of government, in which the smaller council (compared to the number of previous ward representatives) hires a professional manager to operate daily affairs of the city.  From 1924 to 1957, the council was elected by [[proportional representation]] and single transfer voting (STV). Starting with Ashtabula in 1915, several major cities in Ohio adopted this electoral system, which had the practical effect of reducing ward boss and political party power. For that reason, such groups opposed it.\n\nIn an effort to overturn the charter that provided for proportional representation, opponents in 1957 fanned fears of black political power, at a time of increasing civil rights activism.<ref name=\"amy\">[https://www.mtholyoke.edu/acad/polit/damy/articles/Brief%20History%20of%20PR.htm Douglas J.

Residents of Cincinnati played a major role in [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionism]]. Many [[fugitive slave]]s used the Ohio at Cincinnati to escape to the North. Cincinnati had numerous stations on the Underground Railroad, but there were also runaway slave catchers active in the city, who put escaping slaves at risk of recapture.\n\nGiven its southern Ohio location, Cincinnati had also attracted settlers from the Upper South, who traveled along the Ohio River into the territory. Tensions between abolitionists and slavery supporters broke out in repeated violence, with whites attacking blacks in 1829.

The employers in the [[British West Indies]] declined these conditions, bringing the trade there to an end. Until the trade was finally abolished in 1875, over 150,000 coolies had been sold to Cuba alone, the majority having been shipped from Macau. These labourers endured conditions far worse than those experienced by their Indian counterparts. Even after the 1866 reforms, the scale of abuse and conditions of near slavery did not get any better \u2013 if anything they deteriorated. In the early 1870s increased media exposure of the trade led to a public outcry, and the British, as well as the [[Qing government]], put pressure on the Portuguese authorities to bring the trade at Macau to an end; this was ultimately achieved in 1874.<ref name=\"whkmla\" /> By that time, a total of up to half a million Chinese workers had been exported.<ref>{{cite book |url = https://books.google.com/?id=H7dBmBsd-XgC |title = The Coolie Trade: The Traffic in Chinese Laborers to Latin America 1847\u20131874 |last = Meagher |first = Arnold J. |year=2008 |publisher = Arnold J. |accessdate = 7 February 2013 |isbn = 9781436309431 }}</ref>\n\nThe term ''coolie'' was also applied to Chinese workers recruited for contracts on cacao plantations in [[German Samoa]]. German planters went to great lengths to secure access to their \"coolie\" labour supply from China. In 1908, a Chinese commissioner, Lin Shu Fen, reported on the cruel treatment of coolie workers on German plantations in the western Samoan Islands. The trade began largely after the establishment of colonial German Samoa in 1900 and lasted until the arrival of New Zealand forces in 1914.

By 1830, over 3,000 labourers had been transported. After this trade was discovered, the French successfully negotiated with the British in 1860 for permission to transport over 6,000 workers annually, on condition that the trade would be suspended if abuses were discovered to be taking place.<ref name=CoolieLabor18/><ref>{{cite web|title=St. Lucia's Indian Arrival Day|year=2009|publisher=Caribbean Repeating Islands|url=http://repeatingislands.com/2009/05/07/st-lucia\u2019s-indian-arrival-day/}}</ref>\n\nThe British began to transport Indians to [[Mauritius]] in the [[Indian Ocean islands|Indian Ocean]], starting in 1829. [[Slavery]] had been abolished, with the planters receiving two million pounds sterling in compensation for the loss of their slaves. The planters turned to bringing in a large number of [[Indentured servant|indentured labourers]] from India to work in the sugar cane fields. Between 1834 and 1921, around half a million indentured labourers were present on the island. They worked on sugar estates, factories, in transport and on construction sites.<ref name=SouthAsianLabourers4>{{cite web |title=Indian indentured labourers |publisher=The National Archives, Government of the United Kingdom |year=2010 |url = http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/records/research-guides/indian-indentured-labour.htm}}</ref>\n\nIn 1837, the [[East India Company|Raj]] issued a set of regulations for the trade. The rules provided for each labourer to be personally authorised for transportation by an officer designated by the Government, limited the length of service to five years subject to voluntary renewal, made the contractor responsible for returning the worker after the contract elapsed and required the vessels to conform to basic [[Occupational safety and health|health standards]].<ref name=\"whkmla\" />\n\n[[File:Newly arrived coolies in Trinidad.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Newly arrived Indian coolies in [[Trinidad]].]]\n\nDespite this, conditions on the ships were often extremely crowded, with rampant disease and [[malnutrition]]. Coolies were also not informed about the length of the trip or about the island that they would be going to.<ref name=\":1\" /> The workers were paid a pittance for their labour, and were expected to work in often awful and harsh conditions. Although there were no large scale scandals involving coolie abuse in British colonies, workers often ended up being forced to work, and manipulated in such a way that they became dependent on the plantation owners so that in practice they remained there long after their contracts expired; possibly as little as 10% of the coolies actually returned to their original country of origin. Colonial legislation was also passed to severely limit their freedoms; in Mauritius a compulsory [[Internal passport|pass system]] was instituted to enable their movements to be easily tracked. Conditions were much worse in the French colonies of [[R\u00e9union|Reunion]] and [[Guadeloupe]] and [[Martinique]], where workers were 'systematically overworked' and abnormally high [[mortality rate]]s were recorded for those working in the mines.<ref name=\"whkmla\" /> Generally, Indian coolies were noted to have higher mortality rates as a whole, and were less likely to be able to return home.<ref name=\":0\" /> Companies would often promise good food, durable clothing, adequate housing, safe passage, and schools. However, these promises were rarely kept, leading to the higher mortality rate and image of Indian coolies being \"dirty\".<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nThe voyage itself was often a highly dangerous venture, especially for coolie women. Though some ships had made attempts to prevent assault, rape, and general mistreatment in sailor contracts, these crimes were still common. Even with punishments in place, on ship and land, men who assaulted women and children were rarely punished, leaving women in an even more vulnerable position.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Coolie Woman: The Odyssey of Indenture|last=Bahadur|first=Gaiutra|publisher=University of Chicago Press|year=2014|isbn=|location=Chicago|pages=51\u201356}}</ref>\n\nHowever, there were also attempts by the British authorities to regulate and mitigate the worst abuses. Workers were regularly checked up on by [[health inspector]]s, and they were vetted before transportation to ensure that they were suitably healthy and fit to be able to endure the rigours of labour. Children under the age of 15 were not allowed to be transported from their parents under any circumstances.<ref name=\"whkmla\" />\n\nThe first campaign against the 'coolie' trade in England likened the system of [[indentured labour]] to the slavery of the past. The campaign against coolie emigration was led by [[Joseph Sturge]], with the Society of Friends. Petitions from Sturge, the Society of Friends, various other humanitarian groups, and from citizens of entire cities were routinely sent to the Colonial Offices.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Erickson |first=Edgar |date=June 1934 |title=The Introduction of East Indian Coolies into the British West Indies |url= |journal=The Journal of Modern History |volume=6 |issue=2 |page = 132  |doi=10.1086/236112}}</ref> In response to this pressure, the labour export was temporarily stopped in 1839 by the authorities when the scale of the abuses became known, but it was soon renewed due to its growing economic importance. A more rigorous regulatory framework was put into place and [[Fine (penalty)|severe penalties]] were imposed for infractions in 1842. In that year, almost 35,000 people were shipped to Mauritius.<ref name=\"whkmla\" />\n\nIn 1844, the trade was expanded to the colonies in the [[West Indies]], including [[Jamaica]], [[Trinidad]] and [[Demerara]], where the Asian population was soon a major component of the island demographic.\n\n[[File:H09620.jpg|thumb|right|Members of the [[Chinese Labour Corps]] carry out riveting work at the Central Workshops of the [[Royal Tank Regiment]].]]\n\nStarting in 1879, many Indians were transported to [[Fiji]] to work on the [[sugar cane]] plantations. Many of them [[Indians in Fiji|chose to stay]] after their term of indenture elapsed and today they number about 40% of the total population. Indian workers were also imported into the Dutch colony of [[Suriname]] after the Dutch [[Anglo-Dutch Treaties of 1870\u201371|signed a treaty with the United Kingdom on the recruitment of contract workers]] in 1870. In Mauritius, the Indian population are now demographically dominant, with [[Indian festivals]] being celebrated as [[Culture of Mauritius#Public holidays and festivals|national holidays]].<ref name=\"whkmla\" />\n\nThis system prevailed until the early twentieth century. Increasing focus on the brutalities and abuses of the trade by the [[sensationalist]] media of the time, incited public outrage and lead to the official ending of the coolie trade in 1916 by the British government.

With women as a severe minority, their morality was questioned and the actions of men as a result of having so few women was blamed on the women. Between 1858 and 1859, laws were put into place stating that the ratio of men to women could not exceed 2:1, whereas before it was 3:1. However, there continued to be a severe shortage of women. This gave women a new sense of power when it came to choosing a partner. With a shortage of women, it became the responsibility of the male suitor to provide a hefty dowry to a woman's father, regardless of what caste she came from.<ref name=\":2\">Patricia Mohammd, \"Gender Negotiations Among Indians in Trinidad, 917-1947,\" in ''The Caribbean History Reader'', ed.

Rape was a common occurrence, and there were accounts of women being bound and gagged in their own home by men.

Many coolie women saw the chance to leave for the Caribbean as a way to escape abusive husbands, to hide pregnancy, to escape shame, or to simply find a better life. The 1883 Indian Immigration Act aimed to stop women from escaping their abusive husbands, which in turn made it much more difficult for women to emigrate.

The duration of a contract was typically five to eight years, but many coolies did not live out their term of service due to hard labour and mistreatment.

The coolies who worked on the sugar plantations in Cuba and in the guano beds of the [[Chincha Islands]] (the islands of Hell) of Peru were treated brutally. Seventy-five percent of the Chinese coolies in Cuba died before fulfilling their contracts. More than two-thirds of the Chinese coolies who arrived in Peru between 1849 and 1874 died within the contract period.

The coolies were put in the same neighbourhoods as Africans and, since most were unable to return to their homeland or have their wives come to the New World, many married African women.

The rules provided for each labourer to be personally authorised for transportation by an officer designated by the Government, limited the length of service to five years subject to voluntary renewal, made the contractor responsible for returning the worker after the contract elapsed and required the vessels to conform to basic [[Occupational safety and health|health standards]].<ref name=\"whkmla\" />\n\n[[File:Newly arrived coolies in Trinidad.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Newly arrived Indian coolies in [[Trinidad]].]]\n\nDespite this, conditions on the ships were often extremely crowded, with rampant disease and [[malnutrition]]. Coolies were also not informed about the length of the trip or about the island that they would be going to.<ref name=\":1\" /> The workers were paid a pittance for their labour, and were expected to work in often awful and harsh conditions. Although there were no large scale scandals involving coolie abuse in British colonies, workers often ended up being forced to work, and manipulated in such a way that they became dependent on the plantation owners so that in practice they remained there long after their contracts expired; possibly as little as 10% of the coolies actually returned to their original country of origin. Colonial legislation was also passed to severely limit their freedoms; in Mauritius a compulsory [[Internal passport|pass system]] was instituted to enable their movements to be easily tracked. Conditions were much worse in the French colonies of [[R\u00e9union|Reunion]] and [[Guadeloupe]] and [[Martinique]], where workers were 'systematically overworked' and abnormally high [[mortality rate]]s were recorded for those working in the mines.<ref name=\"whkmla\" /> Generally, Indian coolies were noted to have higher mortality rates as a whole, and were less likely to be able to return home.<ref name=\":0\" /> Companies would often promise good food, durable clothing, adequate housing, safe passage, and schools. However, these promises were rarely kept, leading to the higher mortality rate and image of Indian coolies being \"dirty\".<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nThe voyage itself was often a highly dangerous venture, especially for coolie women. Though some ships had made attempts to prevent assault, rape, and general mistreatment in sailor contracts, these crimes were still common. Even with punishments in place, on ship and land, men who assaulted women and children were rarely punished, leaving women in an even more vulnerable position.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Coolie Woman: The Odyssey of Indenture|last=Bahadur|first=Gaiutra|publisher=University of Chicago Press|year=2014|isbn=|location=Chicago|pages=51\u201356}}</ref>\n\nHowever, there were also attempts by the British authorities to regulate and mitigate the worst abuses. Workers were regularly checked up on by [[health inspector]]s, and they were vetted before transportation to ensure that they were suitably healthy and fit to be able to endure the rigours of labour. Children under the age of 15 were not allowed to be transported from their parents under any circumstances.<ref name=\"whkmla\" />\n\nThe first campaign against the 'coolie' trade in England likened the system of [[indentured labour]] to the slavery of the past. The campaign against coolie emigration was led by [[Joseph Sturge]], with the Society of Friends. Petitions from Sturge, the Society of Friends, various other humanitarian groups, and from citizens of entire cities were routinely sent to the Colonial Offices.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Erickson |first=Edgar |date=June 1934 |title=The Introduction of East Indian Coolies into the British West Indies |url= |journal=The Journal of Modern History |volume=6 |issue=2 |page = 132  |doi=10.1086/236112}}</ref> In response to this pressure, the labour export was temporarily stopped in 1839 by the authorities when the scale of the abuses became known, but it was soon renewed due to its growing economic importance. A more rigorous regulatory framework was put into place and [[Fine (penalty)|severe penalties]] were imposed for infractions in 1842. In that year, almost 35,000 people were shipped to Mauritius.<ref name=\"whkmla\" />\n\nIn 1844, the trade was expanded to the colonies in the [[West Indies]], including [[Jamaica]], [[Trinidad]] and [[Demerara]], where the Asian population was soon a major component of the island demographic.\n\n[[File:H09620.jpg|thumb|right|Members of the [[Chinese Labour Corps]] carry out riveting work at the Central Workshops of the [[Royal Tank Regiment]].]]\n\nStarting in 1879, many Indians were transported to [[Fiji]] to work on the [[sugar cane]] plantations. Many of them [[Indians in Fiji|chose to stay]] after their term of indenture elapsed and today they number about 40% of the total population. Indian workers were also imported into the Dutch colony of [[Suriname]] after the Dutch [[Anglo-Dutch Treaties of 1870\u201371|signed a treaty with the United Kingdom on the recruitment of contract workers]] in 1870. In Mauritius, the Indian population are now demographically dominant, with [[Indian festivals]] being celebrated as [[Culture of Mauritius#Public holidays and festivals|national holidays]].<ref name=\"whkmla\" />\n\nThis system prevailed until the early twentieth century. Increasing focus on the brutalities and abuses of the trade by the [[sensationalist]] media of the time, incited public outrage and lead to the official ending of the coolie trade in 1916 by the British government. By that time tens of thousands of Chinese workers were being used along the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]] by the [[Triple Entente|allied forces]] (see [[Chinese Labour Corps]]).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.longlongtrail.co.uk/|title=The Long, Long Trail \u2013 Researching soldiers of the British Army in the Great War of 1914-1919|accessdate=20 December 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Sex ratios and intermarriage among coolies===\n\nA major difference between the Chinese and the Indian coolie trades was that women and children were brought from India, along with men, while Chinese coolies were 99% male.<ref>{{cite book|page=[https://archive.org/details/cooliespeakschin0000yunl/page/8 8]|year=2008|accessdate=17 May 2014|publisher=Temple University Press|volume=|author=Lisa Yun|location=|title=The Coolie Speaks: Chinese Indentured Laborers and African Slaves in Cuba|url=https://archive.org/details/cooliespeakschin0000yunl|url-access=registration|quote=indian coolie woman chinese men.|isbn=978-1592135837}}</ref> This led to a high rate of Chinese men marrying women of other ethnicities such as Indian women and mixedrace Creole women.

With women as a severe minority, their morality was questioned and the actions of men as a result of having so few women was blamed on the women. Between 1858 and 1859, laws were put into place stating that the ratio of men to women could not exceed 2:1, whereas before it was 3:1. However, there continued to be a severe shortage of women. This gave women a new sense of power when it came to choosing a partner. With a shortage of women, it became the responsibility of the male suitor to provide a hefty dowry to a woman's father, regardless of what caste she came from.<ref name=\":2\">Patricia Mohammd, \"Gender Negotiations Among Indians in Trinidad, 917-1947,\" in ''The Caribbean History Reader'', ed. Nicola Foote (New York: Routledge, 2013), 192-194.</ref> Unfortunately, this also put women in a very vulnerable position, especially when alone. Rape was a common occurrence, and there were accounts of women being bound and gagged in their own home by men. Between 1872 and 1900, it was reported that 87 women were murdered with 65 of those being married women who were accused of being unfaithful.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nThe scarcity of Indian women in the Caribbean may not have been completely due to the women's inability to perform work required of them. Many coolie women saw the chance to leave for the Caribbean as a way to escape abusive husbands, to hide pregnancy, to escape shame, or to simply find a better life. The 1883 Indian Immigration Act aimed to stop women from escaping their abusive husbands, which in turn made it much more difficult for women to emigrate. This in part due to an agent generally needing to travel to the woman's village in order to verify who she was.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Coolie Woman: The Odyssey of Indenture|last=Bahadur|first=Gaiutra|publisher=University of Chicago Press|year=2014|isbn=|location=Chicago|pages=26\u201328}}</ref>\n\nChinese women were scarce in every place where Chinese indentured laborers were brought, the migration was dominated by Chinese men.<ref>{{cite book|page=69|year=2010|accessdate=17 May 2014|publisher=BRILL|volume=|author=Isabelle Lausent-Herrera|editor1=Walton Look Lai|editor2=Chee Beng Tan|quote=|location=|title=The Chinese in Latin America and the Caribbean|series=Brill ebook titles|url=https://books.google.com/?id=xrGShVU6VrgC&pg=PA69&dq=walton+look+lie+carribean+chinese+indian+women#v=onepage&q=walton%20look%20lie%20carribean%20chinese%20indian%20women&f=false|isbn=978-9004182134}}</ref> Up to the 1940s men made up the vast majority of the Costa Rican Chinese community.<ref>{{cite book|page=116|year=2010|accessdate=17 May 2014|publisher=BRILL|volume=|author=Isabelle Lausent-Herrera|editor1=Walton Look Lai|editor2=Chee Beng Tan|quote=|location=|title=The Chinese in Latin America and the Caribbean|series=Brill ebook titles|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xrGShVU6VrgC&pg=PA116#v=onepage&q&f=false|isbn=978-9004182134}}</ref> Males made up the majority of the original Chinese community in Mexico and they married Mexican women.<ref>{{cite book|page=68|year=2010|accessdate=17 May 2014|publisher=BRILL|volume=|author=Isabelle Lausent-Herrera|editor1=Walton Look Lai|editor2=Chee Beng Tan|quote=|location=|title=The Chinese in Latin America and the Caribbean|series=Brill ebook titles|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xrGShVU6VrgC&pg=PA68#v=onepage&q&f=false|isbn=978-9004182134}}</ref> One stark difference between Indian and Chinese coolies was the treatment of women, despite both groups having a severe shortage. Though there were crimes against women and women being murdered, these incidents were nowhere near as frequent as with Indian coolies.
