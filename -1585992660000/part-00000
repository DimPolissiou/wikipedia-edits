Through a research career spanning over six decades (1950\u20132014), Yaalon was an active member of the [[International Union for Quaternary Research]] (INQUA) and the International Soil Science Society (ISSS; later the [[International Union of Soil Sciences]]; IUSS). He was awarded the [[Sarton Medal]] for his contribution to the history of science, and the Dokuchaev Award.\n\n==Early life and education==\nDan Hardy Yaalon was born as Hardy Berger on May 11, 1924, in [[Uherske Hradiste]], [[Czechoslovakia]] (modern day [[Czech Republic]]) to a middle-class [[Jews|Jewish]] family involved in the textile business. He was the youngest child of Hugo J. Berger and Elsa Jellinek, and had two older sisters, Dita and Stella. Yaalon was a curious child and a high-achieving pupil, who showed an early interest in exploring his environment. Typical for his family background, Yaalon was part of the [[Maccabi youth movement]], an international [[Zionism|Zionist]] movement aimed at motivating Jewish youth to immigrate to \"[[Land of Israel|Eretz Israel]]\". Yaalon's comfortable childhood was disrupted at the age of 10 by the death of his father.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=A Passion for Science and Zion: The Yaalon Story|last=Yaalon|first=Dan H.|publisher=Maor Wallach Press|year=2012|isbn=|location=Jerusalem|pages=}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Nazi occupation of Czechoslovakia]] five years later in 1939 further fragmented the family. Yaalon's mother encouraged him to leave the country to escape the escalating Anti-Jewish measures. In March 1939, Yaalon left Uherske Hradiste for the [[Youth Aliyah]] School in [[Prague]], a Jewish Youth Immigration School, where he was a student for three months. During that time, Yaalon was offered an internship at the Zionist agricultural training program in [[Denmark]], as a preparatory step for emigrating to Israel. Yaalon left Czechoslovakia and travelled by train via [[Germany]] to [[Denmark]], after which he never saw his mother again. In September 1943, after a long period of hiding and struggling to feed himself, he began academic studies at the [[Royal Veterinary and Agricultural University]] in [[Copenhagen]]. Two months later, Denmark was also occupied by the Nazis, and Yaalon escaped to [[Sweden]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nUpon arrival in Sweden, Yaalon immediately requested admission to the [[Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences]] at [[Uppsala]]. There he met the prominent Swedish soil chemist [[:sv:Sante Mattson|Sante Emil Mattson]] (1886-1980), who appointed Yaalon as his assistant. At that time, Yaalon made his first soil-profile observation. In 1944 Yaalon returned to Czechoslovakia and volunteered in the [[Czech Army]], unaware that his family had been killed in [[The Holocaust]]. After the war, Yaalon discovered that his mother had been sent to [[Theresienstadt concentration camp]] in Czechoslovakia, and then to [[Auschwitz concentration camp|Auschwitz-Birkenau]] in Poland, where she was killed. Yaalon left Czechoslovakia and returned to Denmark to resume his studies, completing a B.Sc. in [[Agricultural science|Agricultural Sciences]] ([[Soil chemistry|Soil Chemistry]]) in July 1947.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n== Move to Israel ==\nIn July 1948, after a long and complex journey from Europe to the [[Levant]], Yaalon reached the newly formed state of Israel. In 1949, he joined the recently established [[Israel Defense Forces]] (IDF), serving a year in the Scientific Service Corps (\"Hemed\"). Around that period, Yaalon changed his first name from Hardy to Dan, and was registered as \"Lieutenant Dan Berger\". During his IDF service, Yaalon participated in the first geological field surveys of the [[Negev]] desert, whose hyperarid climate and rugged terrain with [[Desert pavement|reg]] and loessial soils was completely alien to Yaalon, and became a key area of interest throughout his later career. After demobilization from the IDF, Yaalon found employment as a schoolteacher of chemistry and agriculture in Beit Yerach school, on the southern shore of the [[Sea of Galilee]]. \n[[File:Dan Yaalon in the Negev 2 1960.jpg|thumb|Dan Yaalon describing a loess profile in the Negev, 1960s]]\nIn 1951 Yaalon changed his European-sounding surname \"Berger\" in favor of \"Yaalon\", a combination of two of his favorite words: \"Yael\" (meaning \"little antelope\", the [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] translation of his mother's Czech maiden name \"Jellinek\"), and \"[[Aliyah]]\" ('ascension' in Hebrew, referring to the immigration of Jews to Israel). Yaalon moved \"Hardy\" to a middle name position, and thus became known as \"Dan H. Yaalon\". Shortly after, at a meeting about geological surveying and mapping, Yaalon's colleagues proposed naming some mountains and wadis after themselves. The official naming committee of that time approved the idea, hence the names of \"Mt. Ya\u2019alon\" and \"Wadi Ya'alon\" in the southern Arava region. Around fifteen years later a young [[Nahal group]] (a paramilitary Israel Defense Forces program that combines military service and the establishment of agricultural settlements) that settled in the eastern foothills of Mt. Ya'alon, adopted \"Ya'alon\" as their group name. One of the group members, Moshe Smilansky, himself looking for a Hebrew version of his surname, adopted the group name as his own and changed his name to [[Moshe Ya'alon]]. He went on to become the Chief of Staff of the Israel Defense Forces (2002\u20132005) and subsequently the [[Ministry of Defense (Israel)|Israeli Minister of Defense]] (2013\u20132016).<ref name=\":0\" />[[File:Dan Yaalon describing a loess profile in the Negev, 1960s.jpg|thumb|Dan Yaalon sampling a loess profile in the Negev, 1960s]]\n\n==Academic career==\nYaalon's long research career spanned over six decades, from 1950-2014. In 1950, Yaalon asked Avraham Adolf Reifenberg (1899-1953), professor of soil science at the [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem]], to become a student in the newly formed Soil Science Department, and was accepted as a doctoral student.<ref name=\":0\" /> His dissertation was on the subject of accumulation of salts in the soils of the [[Jordan Valley (Middle East)|Jordan Valley]].<ref>Yaalon, D.H., 1954.

Department of Geology, The Hebrew University of Jerusalem, Jerusalem (in Hebrew).</ref> Yaalon's research guidance was disrupted by Reifenberg's health problems, and when he died in 1953, Yaalon's supervision was passed over to [[:he:\u05e9\u05dc\u05de\u05d4 \u05e8\u05d1\u05d9\u05e7\u05d5\u05d1\u05d9\u05e5'|Shlomo Ravikovitch]] (1899-2000).<ref name=\":0\" />\n \nIn 1954, Yaalon was awarded a Ph.D. degree from the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, and posted to a post-doctoral position at the [[Rothamsted Research|Rothamsted Experimental Station]] in [[England]]. Upon his return to Israel in 1955, Yaalon worked temporarily at a fertilizer research plant in [[Haifa]], while continuing to publish academic output, including his 1955 study on the clay mineralogy of the soils of Israel.<ref>Yaalon, D.H., 1955. Notes on the clay mineralogy of the major soil types of Israel. Bulletin of the Research Council of Israel. 5B, 168\u2013173.</ref> In 1957, Yaalon was appointed as lecturer at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, where he would stay until his retirement and after. Due to his initial background in the field of soil colloids, his academic career focused on the finest fraction and texture of soils, one of his main motivations in working on [[Dust|aeolian]] dust throughout his research career.\n\nIn 1965, Yaalon urged INQUA to adopt the term \"Paleopedology\" (ancient Pedology), establishing the subject as a commission of INQUA,<ref name=\":0\" /> and later in the IUSS.<ref>Yaalon, D., 2001. Proposal for a Commission on PALEOPEDOLOGY. Bulletin of the International Union of Soil Sciences 100, pp. 46-47.</ref><ref>IUSS, 2004. Bulletin of the International Union of Soil Sciences 104, pp.7,13.</ref> In 1966, Yaalon presented his original concept of 'metapedogenesis', in which he defined humans as an important factor of soil formation.<ref>Yaalon, D.H., Yaron, B., 1966. Framework for man-made soil changes\u2013an outline of metapedogenesis. Soil Science. 102, 272\u2013277.</ref> In August 1970, a joint ISSS and INQUA symposium was held in Amsterdam, on the 'Age of Parent Material and Soils', a result of correspondence between Yaalon, Robert Ruhe (1918-1993), and [[:nl:Ferdinand Alexander van Baren|Ferdinand van Baren]] (1905-1975). The symposium was later summarized in the book ''Paleopedology: Origin, Nature and Dating of Paleosols'', edited by Yaalon,<ref>{{Cite book|title=Paleopedology: Origin, Nature and Dating of Paleosols|last=Yaalon|first=Dan H.|publisher=International Society of Soil Science and Israel Universities Press|year=1971|isbn=|location=Jerusalem|pages=}}</ref> which collated 29 selected multidisciplinary papers, including several contributions from Yaalon. In \"Soil-forming processes in time and space\", Yaalon suggested a dynamic model of the soil system, distinguishing between two major groups of soil equilibrium processes: 1) those approaching an equilibrium state at different rates, and; 2) irreversible or self-terminating processes. He then further developed each group and presented a classification of diagnostic pedofeatures according to their state of origin and relative nature of persistence.<ref name=\":1\">Yaalon, D.H., 1971.

International Society of Soil Science and Israel Universities Press, Jerusalem, pp. 29\u201339.</ref>\n\nIn 1973 Yaalon and his former student, Eliezer Ganor (1935-2011), published a work concerning the important role of aeolian dust on the formation of soils in the [[eastern Mediterranean]] during the [[Quaternary]].<ref name=\":2\">Yaalon, D.H., Ganor, E., 1973. The influence of dust on soils during the Quaternary. Soil Science. 116, 146\u2013155.</ref> In that work, he discussed the global modes of dust and paths of distribution, and presented evidence that the red color of the [[Terra rossa (soil)|Terra Rossa soils]] originated from the presence of [[iron oxide]]s in airborne dust, while contradicting Reifenberg and others, who had attributed this color to carbon oxides from the underlying parent rock.<ref name=\":0\" /> Subsequently, Yaalon's arguments for the key role of Quaternary aeolian dust in the formation of soils gained international acceptance. When later asked what he considered to be the highlight of his career, Yaalon said that the dust-soil relations was his most significant contribution.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nIn 1975, Yaalon published \"Conceptual models in pedogenesis: Can soil-forming functions be solved?\",<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite journal|last=Yaalon|first=Dan H.|date=1975|title=Conceptual models in pedogenesis: Can soilforming functions be solved?|url=|journal=Geoderma|volume=14|issue=3|pages=189\u2013205|doi=10.1016/0016-7061(75)90001-4|bibcode=1975Geode..14..189Y}}</ref> a high-profile article in which Yaalon demonstrated the complexity of the quantifying of pedogenetic processes. Consequently, in 1977 Yaalon was elected president of the INQUA Commission on Paleopedology. Another of Yaalon's editorial works was a special issue of ''Geoderma'' entitled \"Climatic and Lithostratigraphic Significance of Paleosols\", summarizing a symposium of the same name held in [[Ottawa]], Canada. In 1994, at the age of 70 and two years past official retirement, Yaalon left his office at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem and only seldom returned to it, continuing his writing, editing and reviewing from his home. In 1997, Yaalon published a paper on the uniqueness of Mediterranean Soils, asking \"What makes them different?\".<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite journal |doi = 10.1016/S0341-8162(96)00035-5|title = Soils in the Mediterranean region: What makes them different?|journal = Catena|volume = 28|issue = 3\u20134|pages = 157\u2013169|year = 1997|last1 = Yaalon|first1 = Dan H.}}</ref> In that paper, he characterized the global nature of [[Mediterranean climate]]s, while focusing on the region which encompasses the [[Mediterranean Sea]]. Discussing the soil and landscape characteristics, this paper gives a broad and detailed overview of the typical Mediterranean environmental conditions, [[geomorphology]], [[geochemistry]], pedology, and anthropogenic impacts on Mediterranean ecosystems.\n\nAlongside his main focus on soil forming processes, Yaalon also made contributions to the fields of the history, philosophy and sociology of soil science. He played a key role in the establishment of the ISSS Working Group on the History of soil science (today the IUSS Commission 4.5 - History, philosophy and sociology of soil science). In 1997 he co-edited the book ''History of Soil Science: International Perspectives''.<ref name=\":5\">{{Cite book|title=History of Soil Science: International Perspectives, Advances in GeoEcology 29|last=Yaalon|first=Dan H.|last2=Berkowicz|first2=S.|publisher=Catena Verlag GMBH|year=1997|isbn=|location=Reiskirchen|pages=}}</ref> This book is a collection of treaties which show historical developments in the understanding and attitude of humans to the soil. As demonstrated in this book, Yaalon's approach to the history of soil sciences emphasized the acknowledgment of soil distinctions and the unfolding of sub-disciplines as utilized by early agriculturists.\n\nYaalon continued publishing new work until the last days of his life. In 2012, after years of draft writing, he published his autobiography, ''A Passion for Science and Zion: The Yaalon Story''.<ref name=\":0\" /> In the last two years of his life, Yaalon was preoccupied with reading [[Archaeology|archaeological]] literature, and [[Geoarchaeology|geoarcheology]]. In the summer of 2013 Yaalon's health deteriorated, and on 29 January 2014 he died at home in [[Mevaseret Zion]], Israel, surrounded by his family.\n\n==Personal life==\nIn 1952 Dan Yaalon married Rita Singer (1926-2010), and soon after their marriage they chose to live in Kiryat Moshe in western Jerusalem. The couple had two sons: David (1953) and Uri (1956). In 1975, the family moved to Givat HaMivtar, a neighborhood on the northern side of [[Jerusalem]], and in 1997 they moved out of Jerusalem, to Mevaseret Zion. By the time of his death, Yaalon had seven grandchildren.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==Awards, honors, and legacy==\n\nYaalon received numerous awards over his career. In 2000, Yaalon received the [[Sarton Medal]], the top award of the History of Science Society, from [[Ghent University]] in [[Belgium]] for outstanding contribution to the History of Soil Science. In 2010, Yaalon received the Dokuchaev Award from the IUSS, in recognition of his life contribution to pedology and soil sciences. Yaalon was also an Honorary Fellow of the British, German, and Russian Soil Science Societies, and received an Honorary Membership from the Israeli (2001) and American (2008) Geological Societies, an Honorary Membership from the IUSS (1998), was an Honorary Life Fellow of INQUA, and received an Honorary Doctorate from the [[University of Tbilisi]] in [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]]. In April 2015 a special IUSS symposium in honor of Yaalon was held at the [[University of Natural Resources and Life Sciences, Vienna|University of Natural Resources and Life Sciences]] (BOKU) in [[Vienna]] and Uherske Hradiste.<ref>Stahr, K., Sauer, D., Ottner, F., Itkin, D., (Eds.) 2015.

After demobilization from the IDF, Yaalon found employment as a schoolteacher of chemistry and agriculture in Beit Yerach school, on the southern shore of the [[Sea of Galilee]]. \n[[File:Dan Yaalon in the Negev 2 1960.jpg|thumb|Dan Yaalon describing a loess profile in the Negev, 1960s]]\nIn 1951 Yaalon changed his European-sounding surname \"Berger\" in favor of \"Yaalon\", a combination of two of his favorite words: \"Yael\" (meaning \"little antelope\", the [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] translation of his mother's Czech maiden name \"Jellinek\"), and \"[[Aliyah]]\" ('ascension' in Hebrew, referring to the immigration of Jews to Israel). Yaalon moved \"Hardy\" to a middle name position, and thus became known as \"Dan H. Yaalon\". Shortly after, at a meeting about geological surveying and mapping, Yaalon's colleagues proposed naming some mountains and wadis after themselves. The official naming committee of that time approved the idea, hence the names of \"Mt. Ya\u2019alon\" and \"Wadi Ya'alon\" in the southern Arava region. Around fifteen years later a young [[Nahal group]] (a paramilitary Israel Defense Forces program that combines military service and the establishment of agricultural settlements) that settled in the eastern foothills of Mt. Ya'alon, adopted \"Ya'alon\" as their group name. One of the group members, Moshe Smilansky, himself looking for a Hebrew version of his surname, adopted the group name as his own and changed his name to [[Moshe Ya'alon]]. He went on to become the Chief of Staff of the Israel Defense Forces (2002\u20132005) and subsequently the [[Ministry of Defense (Israel)|Israeli Minister of Defense]] (2013\u20132016).<ref name=\":0\" />[[File:Dan Yaalon describing a loess profile in the Negev, 1960s.jpg|thumb|Dan Yaalon sampling a loess profile in the Negev, 1960s]]\n\n==Academic career==\nYaalon's long research career spanned over six decades, from 1950-2014. In 1950, Yaalon asked Avraham Adolf Reifenberg (1899-1953), professor of soil science at the [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem]], to become a student in the newly formed Soil Science Department, and was accepted as a doctoral student.<ref name=\":0\" /> His dissertation was on the subject of accumulation of salts in the soils of the [[Jordan Valley (Middle East)|Jordan Valley]].<ref>Yaalon, D.H., 1954. An Investigation of the Effects of Saline Irrigation Water on Sodium Adsorption and Permeability Characteristics of Calcareous Soils.

Laboratory Exercises in Soil Science and Fertilizers. Department of Geology, The Hebrew University of Jerusalem, Jerusalem (in Hebrew).</ref> Yaalon's research guidance was disrupted by Reifenberg's health problems, and when he died in 1953, Yaalon's supervision was passed over to [[:he:\u05e9\u05dc\u05de\u05d4 \u05e8\u05d1\u05d9\u05e7\u05d5\u05d1\u05d9\u05e5'|Shlomo Ravikovitch]] (1899-2000).<ref name=\":0\" />\n \nIn 1954, Yaalon was awarded a Ph.D. degree from the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, and posted to a post-doctoral position at the [[Rothamsted Research|Rothamsted Experimental Station]] in [[England]]. Upon his return to Israel in 1955, Yaalon worked temporarily at a fertilizer research plant in [[Haifa]], while continuing to publish academic output, including his 1955 study on the clay mineralogy of the soils of Israel.<ref>Yaalon, D.H., 1955. Notes on the clay mineralogy of the major soil types of Israel. Bulletin of the Research Council of Israel. 5B, 168\u2013173.</ref> In 1957, Yaalon was appointed as lecturer at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, where he would stay until his retirement and after. Due to his initial background in the field of soil colloids, his academic career focused on the finest fraction and texture of soils, one of his main motivations in working on [[Dust|aeolian]] dust throughout his research career.\n\nIn 1965, Yaalon urged INQUA to adopt the term \"Paleopedology\" (ancient Pedology), establishing the subject as a commission of INQUA,<ref name=\":0\" /> and later in the IUSS.<ref>Yaalon, D., 2001. Proposal for a Commission on PALEOPEDOLOGY. Bulletin of the International Union of Soil Sciences 100, pp. 46-47.</ref><ref>IUSS, 2004. Bulletin of the International Union of Soil Sciences 104, pp.7,13.</ref> In 1966, Yaalon presented his original concept of 'metapedogenesis', in which he defined humans as an important factor of soil formation.<ref>Yaalon, D.H., Yaron, B., 1966. Framework for man-made soil changes\u2013an outline of metapedogenesis. Soil Science. 102, 272\u2013277.</ref> In August 1970, a joint ISSS and INQUA symposium was held in Amsterdam, on the 'Age of Parent Material and Soils', a result of correspondence between Yaalon, Robert Ruhe (1918-1993), and [[:nl:Ferdinand Alexander van Baren|Ferdinand van Baren]] (1905-1975). The symposium was later summarized in the book ''Paleopedology: Origin, Nature and Dating of Paleosols'', edited by Yaalon,<ref>{{Cite book|title=Paleopedology: Origin, Nature and Dating of Paleosols|last=Yaalon|first=Dan H.|publisher=International Society of Soil Science and Israel Universities Press|year=1971|isbn=|location=Jerusalem|pages=}}</ref> which collated 29 selected multidisciplinary papers, including several contributions from Yaalon. In \"Soil-forming processes in time and space\", Yaalon suggested a dynamic model of the soil system, distinguishing between two major groups of soil equilibrium processes: 1) those approaching an equilibrium state at different rates, and; 2) irreversible or self-terminating processes. He then further developed each group and presented a classification of diagnostic pedofeatures according to their state of origin and relative nature of persistence.<ref name=\":1\">Yaalon, D.H., 1971.

International Society of Soil Science and Israel Universities Press, Jerusalem, pp. 29\u201339.</ref>\n\nIn 1973 Yaalon and his former student, Eliezer Ganor (1935-2011), published a work concerning the important role of aeolian dust on the formation of soils in the [[eastern Mediterranean]] during the [[Quaternary]].<ref name=\":2\">Yaalon, D.H., Ganor, E., 1973. The influence of dust on soils during the Quaternary. Soil Science. 116, 146\u2013155.</ref> In that work, he discussed the global modes of dust and paths of distribution, and presented evidence that the red color of the [[Terra rossa (soil)|Terra Rossa soils]] originated from the presence of [[iron oxide]]s in airborne dust, while contradicting Reifenberg and others, who had attributed this color to carbon oxides from the underlying parent rock.<ref name=\":0\" /> Subsequently, Yaalon's arguments for the key role of Quaternary aeolian dust in the formation of soils gained international acceptance. When later asked what he considered to be the highlight of his career, Yaalon said that the dust-soil relations was his most significant contribution.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nIn 1975, Yaalon published \"Conceptual models in pedogenesis: Can soil-forming functions be solved?\",<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite journal|last=Yaalon|first=Dan H.|date=1975|title=Conceptual models in pedogenesis: Can soilforming functions be solved?|url=|journal=Geoderma|volume=14|issue=3|pages=189\u2013205|doi=10.1016/0016-7061(75)90001-4|bibcode=1975Geode..14..189Y}}</ref> a high-profile article in which Yaalon demonstrated the complexity of the quantifying of pedogenetic processes. Consequently, in 1977 Yaalon was elected president of the INQUA Commission on Paleopedology. Another of Yaalon's editorial works was a special issue of ''Geoderma'' entitled \"Climatic and Lithostratigraphic Significance of Paleosols\", summarizing a symposium of the same name held in [[Ottawa]], Canada. In 1994, at the age of 70 and two years past official retirement, Yaalon left his office at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem and only seldom returned to it, continuing his writing, editing and reviewing from his home. In 1997, Yaalon published a paper on the uniqueness of Mediterranean Soils, asking \"What makes them different?\".<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite journal |doi = 10.1016/S0341-8162(96)00035-5|title = Soils in the Mediterranean region: What makes them different?|journal = Catena|volume = 28|issue = 3\u20134|pages = 157\u2013169|year = 1997|last1 = Yaalon|first1 = Dan H.}}</ref> In that paper, he characterized the global nature of [[Mediterranean climate]]s, while focusing on the region which encompasses the [[Mediterranean Sea]]. Discussing the soil and landscape characteristics, this paper gives a broad and detailed overview of the typical Mediterranean environmental conditions, [[geomorphology]], [[geochemistry]], pedology, and anthropogenic impacts on Mediterranean ecosystems.\n\nAlongside his main focus on soil forming processes, Yaalon also made contributions to the fields of the history, philosophy and sociology of soil science. He played a key role in the establishment of the ISSS Working Group on the History of soil science (today the IUSS Commission 4.5 - History, philosophy and sociology of soil science). In 1997 he co-edited the book ''History of Soil Science: International Perspectives''.<ref name=\":5\">{{Cite book|title=History of Soil Science: International Perspectives, Advances in GeoEcology 29|last=Yaalon|first=Dan H.|last2=Berkowicz|first2=S.|publisher=Catena Verlag GMBH|year=1997|isbn=|location=Reiskirchen|pages=}}</ref> This book is a collection of treaties which show historical developments in the understanding and attitude of humans to the soil. As demonstrated in this book, Yaalon's approach to the history of soil sciences emphasized the acknowledgment of soil distinctions and the unfolding of sub-disciplines as utilized by early agriculturists.\n\nYaalon continued publishing new work until the last days of his life. In 2012, after years of draft writing, he published his autobiography, ''A Passion for Science and Zion: The Yaalon Story''.<ref name=\":0\" /> In the last two years of his life, Yaalon was preoccupied with reading [[Archaeology|archaeological]] literature, and [[Geoarchaeology|geoarcheology]]. In the summer of 2013 Yaalon's health deteriorated, and on 29 January 2014 he died at home in [[Mevaseret Zion]], Israel, surrounded by his family.\n\n==Personal life==\nIn 1952 Dan Yaalon married Rita Singer (1926-2010), and soon after their marriage they chose to live in Kiryat Moshe in western Jerusalem. The couple had two sons: David (1953) and Uri (1956). In 1975, the family moved to Givat HaMivtar, a neighborhood on the northern side of [[Jerusalem]], and in 1997 they moved out of Jerusalem, to Mevaseret Zion. By the time of his death, Yaalon had seven grandchildren.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==Awards, honors, and legacy==\n\nYaalon received numerous awards over his career. In 2000, Yaalon received the [[Sarton Medal]], the top award of the History of Science Society, from [[Ghent University]] in [[Belgium]] for outstanding contribution to the History of Soil Science. In 2010, Yaalon received the Dokuchaev Award from the IUSS, in recognition of his life contribution to pedology and soil sciences. Yaalon was also an Honorary Fellow of the British, German, and Russian Soil Science Societies, and received an Honorary Membership from the Israeli (2001) and American (2008) Geological Societies, an Honorary Membership from the IUSS (1998), was an Honorary Life Fellow of INQUA, and received an Honorary Doctorate from the [[University of Tbilisi]] in [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]]. In April 2015 a special IUSS symposium in honor of Yaalon was held at the [[University of Natural Resources and Life Sciences, Vienna|University of Natural Resources and Life Sciences]] (BOKU) in [[Vienna]] and Uherske Hradiste.<ref>Stahr, K., Sauer, D., Ottner, F., Itkin, D., (Eds.) 2015.

Gervaise decides that he has to sell the crown to pay for the repairs. In 1997 Daniel and Fergus are arguing because Daniel has his real dad with him and Fergus doesn't. Fergus throws a baseball at Daniel, he ducks and goes through the mirror, at the same time Constance argues with her father not to sell the crown and grabbed it from his hands and races through the mirror. As Constance and Daniel are travelling through the mirror, the baseball hits it and it shatters into thousands of pieces.

While in the Hall of Mirrors, a kind woman appears to Daniel and Constance. She tells Constance she was right to steal the crown as the [[heir]] is dead. She also reveals that the crown can make a difference to the future. Meanwhile, in 1867 Gervais strikes gold, meaning he no longer has any need to sell the crown. The mirror appears and Constance goes through. Upon her return, Constance discovers that her father has entrusted the crown to her to do as she sees fit, but before she can arrange this with her friends in the 1990s, the mirror vanishes, signifying the end of their adventures. Back in 1997, Daniel, Fergus and Mandy visit Constance's grave and discover a clue to the location of the crown. Someone arrives and gives them a letter from Constance. The letter states that they are the new proprietors of the Crown Foundation. Now that their adventures had come to an end, Daniel decides to go back home and stay with this mum.\n\nIn an epilogue, an old woman sits in the Hall of Mirrors, apparently waiting for someone. She is eventually joined by an old man, who greets her and expresses his joy that she waited, just as he hoped she would. In a flash of light, the old woman is revealed to be Constance and the old man Daniel. After her death, she waited in the Hall of Mirrors for Daniel, so that the two could advance to the afterlife together.

After high school, he worked at sea on the steam ship ''Darwin.'' In 1972, he received a scholarship from the Leopold Schepp Foundation to attend [[Fairleigh Dickinson University]], from where he graduated ''[[Summa Cum Laude]]'' in Ancient History. Whilst undertaking a further degree in Classical Art and Archaeology at [[Rutgers University]], he was a research assistant in Greek Pottery at the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]], New York.  In 1976 he was awarded a Commonwealth scholarship to [[Lincoln College, Oxford|Lincoln College]], Oxford University, to study classical archaeology. In 1985, he was given a Junior Research Fellowship at [[St Catherine's College, Oxford|St Catherine's College]], Oxford University. At the same time, under the Chairmanship of [[Alan Bullock]], he was appointed Director of Oxford University MARE<ref name=\"DragonSea\" />, the first academic maritime archaeological unit in England. In 1994, he became the Triton Fellow in Maritime Archaeology at [[St Peter's College, Oxford|St. Peter's College]], Oxford. He retired from academic life in 2013 to pursue his interest in deep-ocean archaeology.\n\n== Early archaeological experience ==\nBound's student experience as an archaeologist was on land, where he worked on Roman villa sites outside Rome<ref>{{cite web |title=The Via Gabina Villas |url=http://viagabina.rice.edu/ |publisher=Rice University |accessdate=4 April 2020}}</ref> and various sites in the English Midlands. Bound's underwater archaeological career began in 1979 when he worked for [[George Bass (archaeologist)|George Bass]] of the [[Institute of Nautical Archaeology]] in Texas on sites off the coast of Turkey.

The entire top floor of the national underwater museum at Porto Santo Stefano is dedicated to the finds from the Giglio ship.\n\n<u>The rescue excavation of the Hoi An Wreck</u>\n\nThe Hoi An wreck was a mid-15<sup>th</sup> century junk that was lost in the South China Sea, 22 kilometres to the west of the Da Nang headland, with a cargo of Vietnamese porcelain that had been made at Cu Dao on the Red River Delta.&nbsp; The wreck was discovered by fishermen around the early 1990s.&nbsp; For several years the site was intensively plundered resulting in pieces turning up on the market all over the world.&nbsp; The method employed by the looters was to drag a series of hooks across the site with nets behind the catch to dislodge artefacts.\n\nThe wreck was discovered by the Vietnamese Authorities following the arrest of two dealers at Da Nang airport who had in their possession suitcases full of pottery from the site. The problem was that the wreck was beyond standard diving depth, but something had to be done quickly to prevent further looting.&nbsp; Bound's maritime archaeology unit at Oxford University was contracted to conduct &nbsp;a rescue excavation of the wreck, with York Archaeological Trust providing conservation services.&nbsp; Over three seasons the team excavated a third of a million pieces of pottery, far more than expected and enough to fill two large warehouses.&nbsp; Most of the pottery was repetitive everyday table ware of little artistic value but there were also items of outstanding artistry.&nbsp; An \u2018Evaluation Committee\u2019 of leading Vietnamese archaeologists and art historians selected all the most important pieces for the National Collection in Hanoi and then other museums were invited to select what they wished.&nbsp; Six museums in Vietnam now host permanent exhibitions of material from the wreck. What was left was put on the market with part of the proceeds being used to pay for the display, curation and study of the selection that went into the National Collection.\n\nThe Hoi An excavation (1997\u201399) was the deepest hands-on excavation there has been.&nbsp; Involving three large vessels, three deep-ocean tugs, two gun-boats for protection and over 150 people, this was also the most expensive excavation there has been.\n\nDiving was a 24-hour operation working at a maximum dive-table depth of 82 meters. Saturation diving techniques were employed in which divers lived in pressurized modules on the deck and were transported to and from the site in a dive-bell. This is the only time that this advanced method of diving has been used in underwater archaeology. Bound considers this to have been the most important project of his career, however, it is known that following the excavation, looting of the site resumed.\n\n<u>Lord Nelson's ''Agamemnon''</u>\n\nIn 1997 Bound led a survey of the frigate HMS ''Agamemnon'' (built 1781).&nbsp; This was Nelson's first major command, the ship upon which he first fought the French and which, in 1805, was part of his column at Trafalgar. It was also the ship upon which he first met Lady Hamilton.&nbsp; In 1809, the ship was lost in Maldonado Bay near the mouth of the River Plate.&nbsp; The main result of the survey was the discovery of a cannon which, because of the number on its breach, was confirmed by the Woolwich Arsenal to be the only cannon in existence that can be proven to have been fired in the Battle of Trafalgar. The cannon was conserved in the Uruguayan Navy Yard and is now on display in the Maritime Museum of Montevideo.\n\n<u>Pocket Battleship ''Admiral Graf Spee''</u> In 1997 Bound conducted the first archaeological survey of the \u2018pocket\u2019 battleship ''Admiral Graf Spee'' which blew herself up not far from Montevideo following the Battle of the River Plate in December 1939.  The wreck was found by dragging an anchor through the water.  A sidescan survey showed that the wreck was upright but heeled to starboard and that she was in two parts, the separation occurring where the after turret had exploded during scuttling operations.  Following the survey, Bound was given permission by the Uruguayan Navy and Ministry of Culture to recover one of the 5.9-inch guns which is now on display outside the maritime museum in Montevideo.  Bound was also part of the small team which in subsequent years, under the leadership of H. Bado and A. Etchegaray, recovered the range finder (now on display in the port of Montevideo) and the bronze stern eagle (now in storage in the Cerro Museum, Montevideo)<ref>{{cite web |title=Graf Spee rangefinder recovered |url=https://en.mercopress.com/2004/02/26/graf-spee-range-finder-recovered |website=Mercopress |accessdate=28 March 2020}}</ref>.\n\n== Documentaries ==\nBound's work has been the focus of many documentaries in England, Italy and the US, including an award-winning, four-part series entitled ''Lost Ships'' by the [[Discovery Channel]], which covered the ''Agamemnon'', the Hoi An wreck, the ''Graf Spee'' and the Mahdia ship. The [[BBC]] has made several documentaries on Bound's work including ''Queen Elizabeth's Lost Guns'', about the recovery, replication and test-firing of an Elizabethan iron cannon from the Alderney wreck<ref name=\"timewatchlostguns\" />.

He is a fifth-generation Islander whose great-great grandfather, James Biggs, arrived with the first colonists to Port Louis on the brig ''Hebe'' in January 1842. His great grandfather, William Biggs, was the first to raise the Union Jack when the settlement was moved to Jackson's Harbour (now Port Stanley) in 1843-44.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Strange |first1=Ian J |title=The Falkland Islands |date=26 January 1984 |publisher=David & Charles |isbn=978-0715385319}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last1=Biggs |first1=James |title=The Dictionary of Falklands Biography |date=1 June 2008 |publisher=David Tatham |isbn=978-0955898501 |url=https://falklandsbiographies.org/biographies/biggs_james}}</ref> \nBound's early education was in the Falkland Islands and Montevideo, Uruguay. After high school, he worked at sea on the steam ship ''Darwin.'' In 1972, he received a scholarship from the Leopold Schepp Foundation to attend [[Fairleigh Dickinson University]], from where he graduated ''[[Summa Cum Laude]]'' in Ancient History. Whilst undertaking a further degree in Classical Art and Archaeology at [[Rutgers University]], he was a research assistant in Greek Pottery at the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]], New York.  In 1976 he was awarded a Commonwealth scholarship to [[Lincoln College, Oxford|Lincoln College]], Oxford University, to study classical archaeology. In 1985, he was given a Junior Research Fellowship at [[St Catherine's College, Oxford|St Catherine's College]], Oxford University. At the same time, under the Chairmanship of [[Alan Bullock]], he was appointed Director of Oxford University MARE<ref name=\"DragonSea\" />, the first academic maritime archaeological unit in England. In 1994, he became the Triton Fellow in Maritime Archaeology at [[St Peter's College, Oxford|St. Peter's College]], Oxford. He retired from academic life in 2013 to pursue his interest in deep-ocean archaeology.\n\n== Early archaeological experience ==\nBound's student experience as an archaeologist was on land, where he worked on Roman villa sites outside Rome and various sites in the English Midlands. Bound's underwater archaeological career began in 1979 when he worked for [[George Bass (archaeologist)|George Bass]] of the [[Institute of Nautical Archaeology]] in Texas on sites off the coast of Turkey. This was followed by the [[Madrague de Giens (shipwreck)|''Madrague de Giens'']] shipwreck off the South of France and the ''[[Mary Rose]]'' in England<ref name=\"seahistorymare\">{{cite news |last1=Dingemans |first1=Timothy G |title=Oxford's Nautical Archaeology Team: The First Ten Years of MARE |url=https://issuu.com/seahistory/docs/sh_057_spring-1991/22 |accessdate=29 March 2020 |issue=Spring 1991 |publisher=Sea History |pages=22-24}}</ref>.\n\n== Principal excavations and surveys ==\nThe following are some of the surveys and excavations directed by Bound:\n\n# The Giglio wreck. 1981\u201386.

Bound was also the first in maritime archaeology to use ROVs (Giglio excavation) and mixed gas techniques (nitrox during the Giglio excavation and surface-demand heliox systems on later projects). \n\n<u>The Giglio Ship</u>\n\nIn 1961, a diver named Reg Vallintine, who had a dive school on the Island of Giglio off Tuscany, discovered a wreck from 600 BC in 50 meters of water beside a reef in Campese Bay. Between 1982 and 1986, the wreck was excavated by an Oxford University team led by Bound.&nbsp; Fine wares from the site consisted mainly of Corinthian, Laconian, Ionian and Etruscan fabrics representing a range of shapes.&nbsp; Some were painted with human figures, animals, florals and mythological motifs.&nbsp; The storage jars (amphorae) were of Etruscan, Samian, East Greek and Punic-Phoenician origin; some contained pitch, olives and olive oil.&nbsp; Other finds included amber, lamps, arrowheads, parts of helmets, copper nuggets, iron bars, gaming, bones, musical pipes, a wooden writing plaque, callipers, lead and copper ingots. &nbsp; Surviving ship's timber displayed \u2018sewn\u2019 joinery techniques.&nbsp; In 1961 an intact bronze helmet decorated with etched boars and snakes was found on the wreck by a sports diver and taken to Germany; its whereabouts are currently unknown. The entire top floor of the national underwater museum at Porto Santo Stefano is dedicated to the finds from the Giglio ship.\n\n<u>The rescue excavation of the Hoi An Wreck</u>\n\nThe Hoi An wreck was a mid-15<sup>th</sup> century junk that was lost in the South China Sea, 22 kilometres to the west of the Da Nang headland, with a cargo of Vietnamese porcelain that had been made at Cu Dao on the Red River Delta.&nbsp; The wreck was discovered by fishermen around the early 1990s.&nbsp; For several years the site was intensively plundered resulting in pieces turning up on the market all over the world.&nbsp; The method employed by the looters was to drag a series of hooks across the site with nets behind the catch to dislodge artefacts.\n\nThe wreck was discovered by the Vietnamese Authorities following the arrest of two dealers at Da Nang airport who had in their possession suitcases full of pottery from the site. The problem was that the wreck was beyond standard diving depth, but something had to be done quickly to prevent further looting.&nbsp; Bound's maritime archaeology unit at Oxford University was contracted to conduct &nbsp;a rescue excavation of the wreck, with York Archaeological Trust providing conservation services.&nbsp; Over three seasons the team excavated a third of a million pieces of pottery, far more than expected and enough to fill two large warehouses.&nbsp; Most of the pottery was repetitive everyday table ware of little artistic value but there were also items of outstanding artistry.&nbsp; An \u2018Evaluation Committee\u2019 of leading Vietnamese archaeologists and art historians selected all the most important pieces for the National Collection in Hanoi and then other museums were invited to select what they wished.&nbsp; Six museums in Vietnam now host permanent exhibitions of material from the wreck. What was left was put on the market with part of the proceeds being used to pay for the display, curation and study of the selection that went into the National Collection.\n\nThe Hoi An excavation (1997\u201399) was the deepest hands-on excavation there has been.&nbsp; Involving three large vessels, three deep-ocean tugs, two gun-boats for protection and over 150 people, this was also the most expensive excavation there has been.\n\nDiving was a 24-hour operation working at a maximum dive-table depth of 82 meters. Saturation diving techniques were employed in which divers lived in pressurized modules on the deck and were transported to and from the site in a dive-bell. This is the only time that this advanced method of diving has been used in underwater archaeology. Bound considers this to have been the most important project of his career, however, it is known that following the excavation, looting of the site resumed.\n\n<u>Lord Nelson's ''Agamemnon''</u>\n\nIn 1997 Bound led a survey of the frigate HMS ''Agamemnon'' (built 1781).&nbsp; This was Nelson's first major command, the ship upon which he first fought the French and which, in 1805, was part of his column at Trafalgar. It was also the ship upon which he first met Lady Hamilton.&nbsp; In 1809, the ship was lost in Maldonado Bay near the mouth of the River Plate.&nbsp; The main result of the survey was the discovery of a cannon which, because of the number on its breach, was confirmed by the Woolwich Arsenal to be the only cannon in existence that can be proven to have been fired in the Battle of Trafalgar. The cannon was conserved in the Uruguayan Navy Yard and is now on display in the Maritime Museum of Montevideo.\n\n<u>Pocket Battleship ''Admiral Graf Spee''</u> In 1997 Bound conducted the first archaeological survey of the \u2018pocket\u2019 battleship ''Admiral Graf Spee'' which blew herself up not far from Montevideo following the Battle of the River Plate in December 1939.  The wreck was found by dragging an anchor through the water.  A sidescan survey showed that the wreck was upright but heeled to starboard and that she was in two parts, the separation occurring where the after turret had exploded during scuttling operations.  Following the survey, Bound was given permission by the Uruguayan Navy and Ministry of Culture to recover one of the 5.9-inch guns which is now on display outside the maritime museum in Montevideo.  Bound was also part of the small team which in subsequent years, under the leadership of H. Bado and A. Etchegaray, recovered the range finder (now on display in the port of Montevideo) and the bronze stern eagle (now in storage in the Cerro Museum, Montevideo)<ref>{{cite web |title=Graf Spee rangefinder recovered |url=https://en.mercopress.com/2004/02/26/graf-spee-range-finder-recovered |website=Mercopress |accessdate=28 March 2020}}</ref>.\n\n== Documentaries ==\nBound's work has been the focus of many documentaries in England, Italy and the US, including an award-winning, four-part series entitled ''Lost Ships'' by the [[Discovery Channel]], which covered the ''Agamemnon'', the Hoi An wreck, the ''Graf Spee'' and the Mahdia ship. The [[BBC]] has made several documentaries on Bound's work including ''Queen Elizabeth's Lost Guns'', about the recovery, replication and test-firing of an Elizabethan iron cannon from the Alderney wreck<ref name=\"timewatchlostguns\" />.

Further confusion arises from the use of the term eradication to refer to the total removal of a given [[pathogen]] from an individual (also known as clearance of an [[infection]]), particularly in the context of [[HIV]] and certain other [[virus]]es where such cures are sought.\n\nSelection of infectious diseases for eradication is based on rigorous criteria, as both biological and technical features determine whether a pathogenic organism is (at least potentially) eradicable. The targeted [[organism]] must not have a non-human [[Natural reservoir|reservoir]] (or, in the case of animal diseases, the infection reservoir must be an easily identifiable species, as in the case of [[rinderpest]]), and/or amplify in the environment. This implies that sufficient information on the life cycle and transmission dynamics is available at the time an eradication initiative is programmed. An efficient and practical intervention (such as a vaccine or antibiotic) must be available to interrupt transmission of the infective agent. Studies of measles in the pre-vaccination era led to the concept of the [[critical community size]], the size of the population below which a pathogen ceases to circulate.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Bartlett MS |title=Measles periodicity and community size|journal=J. R. Stat. Soc.|date=1957|series=Ser. A|issue=120|pages=48\u201370}}</ref> Use of vaccination programmes before the introduction of an eradication campaign can reduce the susceptible population.

Further confusion arises from the use of the term eradication to refer to the total removal of a given [[pathogen]] from an individual (also known as clearance of an [[infection]]), particularly in the context of [[HIV]] and certain other [[virus]]es where such cures are sought.\n\nSelection of infectious diseases for eradication is based on rigorous criteria, as both biological and technical features determine whether a pathogenic organism is (at least potentially) eradicable. The targeted [[organism]] must not have a non-human [[Natural reservoir|reservoir]] (or, in the case of animal diseases, the infection reservoir must be an easily identifiable species, as in the case of [[rinderpest]]), and/or amplify in the environment. This implies that sufficient information on the life cycle and transmission dynamics is available at the time an eradication initiative is programmed. An efficient and practical intervention (such as a vaccine or antibiotic) must be available to interrupt transmission of the infective agent. Studies of measles in the pre-vaccination era led to the concept of the [[critical community size]], the size of the population below which a pathogen ceases to circulate.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Bartlett MS |title=Measles periodicity and community size|journal=J.

The [[Carter Center]] has led the effort to eradicate the disease, along with the CDC, the WHO, UNICEF, and the [[Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation]].\n\nUnlike diseases such as smallpox and polio, there is no vaccine or [[drug]] therapy for guinea worm. Eradication efforts have been based on making [[drinking water]] supplies safer (e.g. by provision of borehole wells, or through treating the water with larvicide), on containment of infection and on education for safe drinking water practices. These strategies have produced many successes: two decades of eradication efforts have reduced guinea worm's global [[incidence (epidemiology)|incidence]] to 22 cases in 2015, after which cases rose to 25 cases in 2016, and 30 cases in 2017, but this is still down from an estimated 3.5 million in 1986.
