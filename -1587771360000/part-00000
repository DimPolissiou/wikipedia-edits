The movement has been accused of doctrinal inconsistency and reversals, failed predictions, mistranslation of the Bible, harsh treatment of former members and autocratic and coercive leadership. Criticism has also focused on their rejection of [[blood transfusions]], particularly in life-threatening medical situations, and claims that they have failed to report cases of [[sexual abuse]] to the authorities, as well as the mishandling of instances of [[domestic violence]]. The impact of their teachings on the minds of developing children has also been called into question. Many of the claims are denied by Jehovah's Witnesses and some have also been disputed by courts and religious scholars.\n\n==Doctrinal criticisms==\n\n===Failed predictions===\n{{Main|Watch Tower Society unfulfilled predictions}}\n{{See also|Eschatology of Jehovah's Witnesses}}\nCentral to Jehovah's Witnesses' beliefs are their interpretations of the [[second coming]] of Christ, the [[Millenarianism|millennium]] and the [[kingdom of God]].

There can be no more question about 1925 than there was about 1914.... Looking back we can now easily see that those dates were clearly indicated in Scripture and doubtless intended by the Lord to encourage his people....That all that some expect to see in 1925 may not transpire that year will not alter the date one whit more than in the other cases.\u201d (''The Watch Tower'', May 15, 1922, p. 150; Raymond Franz, Crisis of Conscience, page 224).</ref>\nWitnesses are told to 'be complete in accepting the visible organization's direction in every aspect' and that there is no need to question what God tells them through his Word and organization since love \"believes all things.\"<ref name=\"FollowingFaithful\">{{cite magazine|magazine=The Watchtower|date=1 October 1967|page=591|title=Following Faithful Shepherds with Life in View|url=https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/d/r1/lp-e/1967723|quote=Make haste to identify the visible theocratic organization of God that represents his king, Jesus Christ.

He also cites \"Identifying the Right Kind of Messenger\" (''The Watchtower'', May 1, 1997, page 8) which identifies the Witnesses as his \"true messengers ... by making the messages he delivers through them come true\", in contrast to \"false messengers\", whose predictions fail. In ''In Search of Christian Freedom,'' 2007, he quotes ''The Nations Shall Know That I Am Jehovah - How?'' (1971, pg 70, 292) which describes Witnesses as the modern Ezekiel class, \"a genuine prophet within our generation\". The Watch Tower book noted: \"Concerning the message faithfully delivered by the Ezekiel class, Jehovah positively states that it 'must come true' ... those who wait undecided until it does 'come true' will also have to know that a prophet himself had proved to be in the midst of them.\" He also cites \"Execution of the Great Harlot Nears\", (''The Watchtower'', October 15, 1980, pg 17) which claims God gives the Witnesses \"special knowledge that others do not have ... advance knowledge about this system's end\".</ref> Professor James A. Beverley, along with others, has accused the movement of false prophecy for making those predictions, particularly because of assertions in some cases that the predictions were beyond doubt or had been approved by God, but describes its record of telling the future as \"pathetic\".<ref>James A.

But we display our faith in God\u2019s Word and its sure promises by declaring its message to others. Moreover, the need to revise our understanding somewhat does not make us false prophets or change the fact that we are living in 'the last days,' ... How foolish to take the view that expectations needing some adjustment should call into question the whole body of truth! The evidence is clear that Jehovah has used and is continuing to use his one organization.\"</ref> Raymond Franz claims that the Watch Tower Society tries to evade its responsibility when citing human fallibility as a defense, adding that the Society represents itself as God's appointed spokesman, and that throughout its history has made many emphatic predictions.

Chryssides]] has suggested widespread claims that Witnesses \"keep changing the dates\" are a distortion and misunderstanding of Watch Tower Society chronology. He argues that, although there have been failures in prophetic speculation, the changing views and dates of the Jehovah's Witnesses are more largely attributable to changed understandings of biblical chronology than to failed predictions.

It noted: \"On the contrary, it appears that many Jehovah's Witnesses have made a deliberate choice to refuse blood transfusions in advance, free from time constraints of an emergency situation.\" The court said: \"The freedom to accept or refuse specific medical treatment, or to select an alternative form of treatment, is vital to the principles of self-determination and personal autonomy. A competent adult patient is free to decide ... not to have a blood transfusion. However, for this freedom to be meaningful, patients must have the right to make choices that accord with their own views and values, regardless of how irrational, unwise or imprudent such choices may appear to others.\" The court also stated that, \"even though the Jehovah's Witnesses whose opposition to blood transfusions was cited in evidence were adults having legal capacity to refuse that form of treatment, the findings of the Russian courts can be understood to mean that their refusals had not been an expression of their true will but rather the product of pressure exerted on them by the applicant community. The Court accepts that, given that health and possibly life itself are at stake in such situations, the authenticity of the patient's refusal of medical treatment is a legitimate concern.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cmiskp.echr.coe.int/tkp197/view.asp?action=html&documentId=869647&portal=hbkm&source=externalbydocnumber&table=F69A27FD8FB86142BF01C1166DEA398649|title=HUDOC - European Court of Human Rights|accessdate=31 December 2016}}</ref>\n\n===Shunning===\n{{Main|Jehovah's Witnesses and congregational discipline|Shunning}}\nWitnesses practice disfellowshipping of members who unrepentantly engage in \"gross sin\",<ref name=\"accept\">\"[https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/d/r1/lp-e/2006845 Always Accept Jehovah\u2019s Discipline]\", ''The Watchtower'', November 15, 2006, page 26.</ref> (most commonly for breaches of the Witnesses' code of personal morality),<ref>\"[https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/d/r1/lp-e/2002725 Cultivate Obedience as the End Draws Near]\", ''The Watchtower'', October 1, 2002, page 21</ref><ref>{{Citation | last = Beckford | first = James A. |authorlink = James A.

As such, women are expected to remain subservient to their husbands: \u201cThe Bible explains that women, whether married or single, should submit to the headship of spiritually qualified men who exercise oversight in the Christian congregation. (1 Timothy 2:12, 13; Hebrews 13:17) When women follow God\u2019s direction to do so, they set an example for the angels in God\u2019s organizational arrangement. (1 Corinthians 11:8-10) In addition, older married women, by their fine example and helpful suggestions, teach younger women to \u2018subject themselves to their own husbands.\u2019\u201d\u200b\u2014Titus 2:3-5.\u201d<ref>{{cite journal |title=Wives, Deeply Respect Your Husbands |journal=Watchtower |date=15 February 2007 |volume=128 |issue=4 |pages=19-20 |url=https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/d/r1/lp-e/2007125}}</ref>\n\nThis position of subservience appears more evident in Watchtower publications that discuss stories of women who choose to stay with abusive husbands.

The night before, Steve had hit me as I had tried to prove a point, and I was feeling sad and sorry for myself. After I told the sister what had happened and how I felt, she asked me to read 1 Corinthians 13:4-7. As I did, I began to reason, \u2018Steve never does any of these loving things for me.\u2019 But the sister made me think differently by asking, \u2018How many of those acts of love do you show to- ward your husband?\u2019 My answer was, \u2018None, for he is so difficult to live with.\u2019 The sister softly said, \u2018Selma, who is trying to be a Christian here?

He also cites \"Identifying the Right Kind of Messenger\" (''The Watchtower'', May 1, 1997, page 8) which identifies the Witnesses as his \"true messengers ... by making the messages he delivers through them come true\", in contrast to \"false messengers\", whose predictions fail. In ''In Search of Christian Freedom,'' 2007, he quotes ''The Nations Shall Know That I Am Jehovah - How?'' (1971, pg 70, 292) which describes Witnesses as the modern Ezekiel class, \"a genuine prophet within our generation\". The Watch Tower book noted: \"Concerning the message faithfully delivered by the Ezekiel class, Jehovah positively states that it 'must come true' ... those who wait undecided until it does 'come true' will also have to know that a prophet himself had proved to be in the midst of them.\" He also cites \"Execution of the Great Harlot Nears\", (''The Watchtower'', October 15, 1980, pg 17) which claims God gives the Witnesses \"special knowledge that others do not have ... advance knowledge about this system's end\".</ref> Professor James A.

It noted: \"On the contrary, it appears that many Jehovah's Witnesses have made a deliberate choice to refuse blood transfusions in advance, free from time constraints of an emergency situation.\" The court said: \"The freedom to accept or refuse specific medical treatment, or to select an alternative form of treatment, is vital to the principles of self-determination and personal autonomy. A competent adult patient is free to decide ... not to have a blood transfusion. However, for this freedom to be meaningful, patients must have the right to make choices that accord with their own views and values, regardless of how irrational, unwise or imprudent such choices may appear to others.\" The court also stated that, \"even though the Jehovah's Witnesses whose opposition to blood transfusions was cited in evidence were adults having legal capacity to refuse that form of treatment, the findings of the Russian courts can be understood to mean that their refusals had not been an expression of their true will but rather the product of pressure exerted on them by the applicant community. The Court accepts that, given that health and possibly life itself are at stake in such situations, the authenticity of the patient's refusal of medical treatment is a legitimate concern.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cmiskp.echr.coe.int/tkp197/view.asp?action=html&documentId=869647&portal=hbkm&source=externalbydocnumber&table=F69A27FD8FB86142BF01C1166DEA398649|title=HUDOC - European Court of Human Rights|accessdate=31 December 2016}}</ref>\n\n===Shunning===\n{{Main|Jehovah's Witnesses and congregational discipline|Shunning}}\nWitnesses practice disfellowshipping of members who unrepentantly engage in \"gross sin\",<ref name=\"accept\">\"[https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/d/r1/lp-e/2006845 Always Accept Jehovah\u2019s Discipline]\", ''The Watchtower'', November 15, 2006, page 26.</ref> (most commonly for breaches of the Witnesses' code of personal morality),<ref>\"[https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/d/r1/lp-e/2002725 Cultivate Obedience as the End Draws Near]\", ''The Watchtower'', October 1, 2002, page 21</ref><ref>{{Citation | last = Beckford | first = James A. |authorlink = James A.

As a doctrine, Jehovah's Witnesses do not reject transfusion of whole autologous blood so long as it is not stored prior to surgery (e.g. peri-operative extraction and transfusion of autologous blood). This religious position is due to their belief that blood is sacred and represents life in God's eyes. Jehovah's Witnesses understand scriptures such as [[Leviticus]] 17:10\u201314 (which speaks of not eating blood) and Acts 15:29 (\"abstain from blood\") to include taking blood into the body via a transfusion.<ref name=\"How Can Blood Save Your Life\">{{cite book|title=How Can Blood Save Your Life?|publisher=Watch Tower Society|page=22}}</ref> Controversy has stemmed, however, from what critics state are inconsistencies in Witness policies on blood, claims that Witness patients are coerced into refusing blood and that Watch Tower literature distorts facts about transfusions and fails to provide information that would allow Witnesses to make an informed decision on the issue.<ref name=\"Muramoto\"/>\n\n====Fractions and components====\nIn the case of [[Blood plasma fractionation|minor fractions derived from blood]], each individual is directed to follow their own conscience on whether these are acceptable.<ref>\"[https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/d/r1/lp-e/2004445 Be guided by the Living God]\" (Jun. 15, 2004).

(1 Corinthians 11:8-10) In addition, older married women, by their fine example and helpful suggestions, teach younger women to \u2018subject themselves to their own husbands.\u2019\u201d\u200b\u2014Titus 2:3-5.\u201d<ref>{{cite journal |title=Wives\u200b Deeply Respect Your Husbands |journal=Watchtower |date=15 February 2007 |volume=128 |issue=4 |pages=19-20 |url=https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/d/r1/lp-e/2007125}}</ref>\n\nThis position of subservience appears more evident in Watchtower publications that discuss stories of women who choose to stay with abusive husbands. The Governing Body, in their publication Awake!, has previously emphasized that while divorce is something that is not taken lightly, leaving an abusive husband should be a personal decision made by the wife\u2014she should not be pressured to leave or stay with her spouse.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Help for Battered Women |journal=Awake! |date=8 November 2001 |volume=82 |issue=21 |pages=9-12 |url=https://www.jw.org/en/library/magazines/g20011108/Help-for-Battered-Women/}}</ref>\n\nHowever, praise has been given to women in the past who remain with abusive husbands. Numerous cases of this behavior have been published in both Awake! and Watchtower magazine, spanning across the history of their publications, in which the \u201csaving\u201d of an abusive spouse takes precedence over separation and the well-being of the person being abused.<ref name=\"Selma\">{{cite journal |title=Happiness Is Possible in a Divided Household |journal=Watchtower |date=15 February 2012 |volume=133 |issue=4 |page=29 |url=https://www.jw.org/en/library/magazines/w20120215/Happiness-Is-Possible-in-a-Divided-Household/}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |title=An End to Domestic Violence |journal=Awake! |date=April 2013 |volume=94 |issue=4 |pages=9-11 |url=https://www.jw.org/en/library/magazines/g201304/end-to-domestic-violence/}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |title=Maintain Your Confidence Firm to the End |journal=Watchtower |date=1 May 1996 |volume=117 |issue=9 |pages=22-23 |url=https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/d/r1/lp-e/1996333}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |title=How Marriage Survives the Assault |journal=Watchtower |date=15 July 1982 |volume=103 |issue=14 |page=7 |url=https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/d/r1/lp-e/1982521}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |title=Can Your Marriage Be Saved? |journal=Watchtower |date=15 December 1969 |volume=90 |issue=24 |pages=739-740 |url=https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/d/r1/lp-e/1969920}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |title=Not Fair-Weather Christians |journal=Watchtower |date=1 July 1958 |volume=79 |issue=13 |page=400 |url=https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/d/r1/lp-e/1958487}}</ref> These anecdotes include that of Selma\u200b\u2014a recently-converted Witness who was in an abusive relationship. Selma endured years of abuse from her husband, Steve. She sought counsel from her friends in the Kingdom, and received the following advice: \u201c\u2018On one particular day,\u2019 says Selma, \u2018I didn\u2019t want to have a Bible study. The night before, Steve had hit me as I had tried to prove a point, and I was feeling sad and sorry for myself. After I told the sister what had happened and how I felt, she asked me to read 1 Corinthians 13:4-7. As I did, I began to reason, \u2018Steve never does any of these loving things for me.\u2019 But the sister made me think differently by asking, \u2018How many of those acts of love do you show to- ward your husband?\u2019 My answer was, \u2018None, for he is so difficult to live with.\u2019 The sister softly said, \u2018Selma, who is trying to be a Christian here? You or Steve?\u2019\u201d Selma endured 17 years of this behavior until her husband \u201caccepted the truth.\u201d<ref name=\"Selma\" /> This wording indicates that Steve had also become a Witness, but not whether or not the abusive behavior halted after this conversion.\n\nPublication of such stories appears to encourage remaining in relationships with abusive husbands, going against the Governing Body\u2019s previous stance taken on the subject in Awake!. These anecdotes remain in the realm of getting a non-believing spouse to convert despite violent behavior, though instances of abuse that take place when the spouse is a part of the Kingdom are also coming to light.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Fowler |first1=Jen\u00e9e |title=Learning to Fear Men Through Christ: How Jehovah's Witnesses Deal with Domestic Violence |url=https://medium.com/@CyanideBlue/learning-to-fear-men-through-christ-how-jehovahs-witnesses-deal-with-domestic-violence-871e03c5ecbc |website=Medium |publisher=A Medium Corporation |date=8 August 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Rellahan |first1=Michael P. |title=Richard Greist, 1970s Killer, Has a Hearing |url=https://www.dailylocal.com/news/national/richard-greist-s-killer-has-a-hearing/article_155a356c-e076-50fc-8dd9-729a7c0f2d03.html |website=Daily Local News |publisher=Daily Local News |date=10 April 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Schapiro |first1=Rich |title=Jehovah's Witness Kills Wife, Himself |url=https://www.nydailynews.com/amp/archives/news/jehovah-witness-kills-wife-article-1.655543 |website=NY Daily News |publisher=New York Daily News |date=2 November 2005}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Quenqua |first1=Douglas |title=A Secret Database of Child Abuse |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/family/archive/2019/03/the-secret-jehovahs-witness-database-of-child-molesters/584311/ |website=The Atlantic |publisher=Atlantic Media Company |date=8 April 2019}}</ref>\n===Psychological Impact on Children===\nThe teachings of Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses are believed to have a significant psychological impact on indoctrinated children.

The bowl is loaded with tobacco then covered by a screen or perforated aluminum foil. Lit coals are then placed on top, which allows the tobacco to heat to the proper temperature. [[File:VortexBowls.jpg|thumb|Vortex Bowls]]\n\nHookah bowls can often be made out of various fruits. By cutting in half a pineapple for example. The fruit is hollowed out and perforated in order to achieve the same shape and system a clay bowl has, then it is loaded and used in the same manner.\n\nBowls have evolved in recent years to incorporate new designs that keep juices in the tobacco from running down the stem. The Tangiers Phunnel Bowl and Sahara Smoke Vortex Bowl are two examples of such bowls.\n\n====Windscreen====\nA Hookah Cover windscreen is a cover that sits over the bowl area, with some form of air holes. This prevents wind from increasing the burn rate and temperature of the coal, and prevents ash and burning embers from being blown onto the surrounding environment. This may also offer some limited protection from fire as it may prevent the coal from being ejected if the hookah is bumped.\n\n====Hose====\nThe hose (one or more) is a slender flexible tube that allows the smoke to be drawn for a distance, cooling down before inhalation. The end is typically fitted with a metal, wooden, or plastic mouthpiece of different shapes, size, color or material type.  Today, the hose proper is typically made from [[Polyvinyl chloride|vinyl]] which allows it to be easily cleaned. According to J. S. Gamble in ''A Manual of Indian Timbers'' in 1902 (p.&nbsp;668), the bark of the white Himalayan birch ''Betula utilis ssp. jacquemontii'' was used to make early hookah tubes.\n\n====Purge valve====\nMany hookahs are equipped with a purge valve connected to the airspace in the water jar to purge stale smoke that has been sitting unused in the jar for too long.  This one-way valve is typically a simple ball bearing sitting over a port that seals the port by gravity alone and will open if positive pressure is created by blowing into the hose. The bearing is held captive with a screw-on cover. The cover should be opened and the bearing and seat cleaned of residue and corrosion regularly to ensure proper sealing.\n\n====Water base====\n[[File:Woodworkdamas.JPG|thumb|upright|right|Woodworkers from [[Damascus]], [[Syria]] creating wood components for hookah production (19th century)]]\n\nThe body of the hookah sits on top of the water base, or sometimes referred to as vase. The downstem hangs down below the level of the water in the jar. Smoke passes through the body and out the downstem where it bubbles through the water. This cools and humidifies the smoke. Liquids such as fruit juice may be added to the water or used in substitution. Pieces of fruit, mint leaves, and crushed ice may be added.\n\n====Plate====\nA plate or ashtray sits just below the bowl to catch ashes falling off the coals.\n\n====Grommets====\n[[Grommet]]s in a hookah are usually placed between the bowl and the body, between the body's gasket and the water jar, and between the body and the hose. The grommets, although not essential (the use of paper or tape has become common), will help to seal the joints between the parts, therefore decreasing the amount of air coming in and maximizing the smoke breathed in.\n\n====Diffuser====\nA piece attached to the bottom of the stem, usually made of plastic and in a grid pattern, to make a smoother smoke and a subdued noise. By breaking the naturally larger bubbles coming up the water from the pipe into smaller bubbles, it lowers the amount of suction or \"pull\" needed to continue bringing smoke to the chamber. This also cools the smoke down more efficiently. It is used as a luxury item used for a better smoking experience and is not a required component.\n\n====Consumable items====\n\n=====Mu\u2018assel=====\nTobacco or [[Mu\u2018assel]] (Arabic: \u0645\u0639\u0633\u0644, which means \"honeyed\"), also sometimes called Shisha in places where it does not refer to the Hookah itself, is a syrupy tobacco mix with molasses and vegetable [[glycerol]] as moisturizer and specific flavors added to it. Typical flavors of mu\u2018assel include apple, grape, guava, lemon, mint, as well as many other fruit-based mixes. Non-tobacco-based mu'assel is also available in certain areas where tobacco smoking is not allowed.\n\n=====Charcoal=====\n[[Charcoal]] is the source of energy to produce heat that will be transferred to the tobacco inside the bowl. Since the glycerol is used to moisturize the tobacco, then to produce smoke, the charcoal should be able to generate heat above the boiling point of glycerol that is 290&nbsp;\u00b0C. Therefore, charcoal for hookah smoking must be hard, high density, easy to ignite, and burn longer with persistent heat.<ref>{{cite web|title=Hookah Charcoal Characteristics|url=http://www.supremecarbon.com/hookah.htm |publisher=Supreme Carbon Indonesia |accessdate=2013-09-03}}</ref>\n\n===Operation===\n[[File:Hookah-lookthrough.svg|thumb|upright|Hookah cross-section view]]\n[[File:Small Argileh.jpg|right|thumb|A small hookah]]\nThe jar at the bottom of the hookah is filled with water sufficient to submerge a few centimeters of the body tube, which is sealed tightly to it. Deeper water will only increase the inhalation force needed to use it. Tobacco or tobacco-free molasses are placed inside the bowl at the top of the hookah. Often the bowl is covered with perforated tin foil or a metal screen and coal placed on top. The foil or screen separates the coal and the tobacco, which reduces inhalation of coal ash from the smoke and reduces the temperature the tobacco is exposed to, in order to prevent burning the tobacco directly.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}\n\nWhen one inhales through the hose, air is pulled through the charcoal and into the bowl holding the tobacco. The hot air, heated by the charcoal vaporizes the tobacco without burning it.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Mridula|first=Morgan|title=Vaporizers: Safe Alternatives to Smoking?|journal=Visions Journal: British Columbia's Mental Health and Addictions Journal|date=2009|volume=5|issue=4|page=29|url=http://www.heretohelp.bc.ca/sites/default/files/visions_cannabis.pdf|editor1-first=Sarah|editor1-last=Hamid-Balma|issn=1490-2494}}</ref>{{Verify source|date=July 2014}} The vapor is passed down through the body tube that extends into the water in the jar. It bubbles up through the water, losing heat, and fills the top part of the jar, to which the hose is attached. When a smoker inhales from the hose, smoke passes into the lungs, and the change in pressure in the jar pulls more air through the charcoal, continuing the process.\n\nIf the hookah has been lit and smoked but has not been inhaled for an extended period, the smoke inside the water jar may be regarded as \"stale\" and undesirable. Stale smoke may be exhausted through the purge valve, if present. This one-way valve is opened by the positive pressure created from gently blowing into the hose. It will not function on a multiple-hose hookah unless all other hoses are plugged. Sometimes one-way valves are put in the hose sockets to avoid the need to manually plug hoses.\n\n==Health effects==\n{{Further|Health effects of tobacco|Mu\u2018assel#Health effects}}\n\n=== Exposure to pathogens that cause infectious diseases ===\nWhen people share a hookah, there is a risk of spreading infectious diseases such as [[oral herpes]], [[tuberculosis]], [[hepatitis]], [[influenza]], and ''[[Helicobacter pylori|H. pylori]]''.<ref name=\"ALAgrowingThreat\">{{cite web |publisher=American Lung Association |url=http://www.lung.org/assets/documents/tobacco/hookah-policy-brief-updated.pdf |title=Hookah Smoking \u2014 A Growing Threat to Public Health |accessdate=27 June 2018}}</ref> Using personal disposable mouthpieces may reduce this risk but does not eliminate it.<ref>{{cite web |title=Waterpipe and Hookah Smoking - A Dangerous New Trend |date=30 October 2015 |publisher=Simcoe Muskoka District Health Unit |url=http://www.simcoemuskokahealth.org/Topics/Tobacco/TobaccoUsePrevention/HookahsAndWaterpipes.aspx |access-date=13 June 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160625062356/http://www.simcoemuskokahealth.org/Topics/Tobacco/TobaccoUsePrevention/HookahsAndWaterpipes.aspx |archive-date=25 June 2016 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n=== Exposure to toxic chemicals ===\nHookah smoke contains multiple toxic chemicals.<ref name=Akl10 /> Water does not filter out many of these chemicals.<ref name=Akl10>{{cite journal|last1=Akl|first1=EA|last2=Gaddam|first2=S|last3=Gunukula|first3=SK|last4=Honeine|first4=R|last5=Jaoude|first5=PA|last6=Irani|first6=J|title=The effects of waterpipe tobacco smoking on health outcomes: a systematic review|journal=International Journal of Epidemiology|date=2010|volume=39|issue=3|pages=834\u201357|pmid=20207606|doi=10.1093/ije/dyq002|doi-access=free}}<!--|accessdate=13 June 2015--></ref> Hookah smoke contains toxic chemicals that come from the burning of the charcoal, tobacco, and flavorings.

The bowl is loaded with tobacco then covered by a screen or perforated aluminum foil. Lit coals are then placed on top, which allows the tobacco to heat to the proper temperature. [[File:VortexBowls.jpg|thumb|Vortex Bowls]]\n\nHookah bowls can often be made out of various fruits. By cutting in half a pineapple for example. The fruit is hollowed out and perforated in order to achieve the same shape and system a clay bowl has, then it is loaded and used in the same manner.\n\nBowls have evolved in recent years to incorporate new designs that keep juices in the tobacco from running down the stem. The Tangiers Phunnel Bowl and Sahara Smoke Vortex Bowl are two examples of such bowls.\n\n====Windscreen====\nA Hookah Cover windscreen is a cover that sits over the bowl area, with some form of air holes. This prevents wind from increasing the burn rate and temperature of the coal, and prevents ash and burning embers from being blown onto the surrounding environment. This may also offer some limited protection from fire as it may prevent the coal from being ejected if the hookah is bumped.\n\n====Hose====\nThe hose (one or more) is a slender flexible tube that allows the smoke to be drawn for a distance, cooling down before inhalation. The end is typically fitted with a metal, wooden, or plastic mouthpiece of different shapes, size, color or material type.  Today, the hose proper is typically made from [[Polyvinyl chloride|vinyl]] which allows it to be easily cleaned. According to J. S. Gamble in ''A Manual of Indian Timbers'' in 1902 (p.&nbsp;668), the bark of the white Himalayan birch ''Betula utilis ssp. jacquemontii'' was used to make early hookah tubes.\n\n====Purge valve====\nMany hookahs are equipped with a purge valve connected to the airspace in the water jar to purge stale smoke that has been sitting unused in the jar for too long.  This one-way valve is typically a simple ball bearing sitting over a port that seals the port by gravity alone and will open if positive pressure is created by blowing into the hose. The bearing is held captive with a screw-on cover. The cover should be opened and the bearing and seat cleaned of residue and corrosion regularly to ensure proper sealing.\n\n====Water base====\n[[File:Woodworkdamas.JPG|thumb|upright|right|Woodworkers from [[Damascus]], [[Syria]] creating wood components for hookah production (19th century)]]\n\nThe body of the hookah sits on top of the water base, or sometimes referred to as vase. The downstem hangs down below the level of the water in the jar. Smoke passes through the body and out the downstem where it bubbles through the water. This cools and humidifies the smoke. Liquids such as fruit juice may be added to the water or used in substitution. Pieces of fruit, mint leaves, and crushed ice may be added.\n\n====Plate====\nA plate or ashtray sits just below the bowl to catch ashes falling off the coals.\n\n====Grommets====\n[[Grommet]]s in a hookah are usually placed between the bowl and the body, between the body's gasket and the water jar, and between the body and the hose. The grommets, although not essential (the use of paper or tape has become common), will help to seal the joints between the parts, therefore decreasing the amount of air coming in and maximizing the smoke breathed in.\n\n====Diffuser====\nA piece attached to the bottom of the stem, usually made of plastic and in a grid pattern, to make a smoother smoke and a subdued noise. By breaking the naturally larger bubbles coming up the water from the pipe into smaller bubbles, it lowers the amount of suction or \"pull\" needed to continue bringing smoke to the chamber. This also cools the smoke down more efficiently. It is used as a luxury item used for a better smoking experience and is not a required component.\n\n====Consumable items====\n\n=====Mu\u2018assel=====\nTobacco or [[Mu\u2018assel]] (Arabic: \u0645\u0639\u0633\u0644, which means \"honeyed\"), also sometimes called Shisha in places where it does not refer to the Hookah itself, is a syrupy tobacco mix with molasses and vegetable [[glycerol]] as moisturizer and specific flavors added to it. Typical flavors of mu\u2018assel include apple, grape, guava, lemon, mint, as well as many other fruit-based mixes. Non-tobacco-based mu'assel is also available in certain areas where tobacco smoking is not allowed.\n\n=====Charcoal=====\n[[Charcoal]] is the source of energy to produce heat that will be transferred to the tobacco inside the bowl. Since the glycerol is used to moisturize the tobacco, then to produce smoke, the charcoal should be able to generate heat above the boiling point of glycerol that is 290&nbsp;\u00b0C. Therefore, charcoal for hookah smoking must be hard, high density, easy to ignite, and burn longer with persistent heat.<ref>{{cite web|title=Hookah Charcoal Characteristics|url=http://www.supremecarbon.com/hookah.htm |publisher=Supreme Carbon Indonesia |accessdate=2013-09-03}}</ref>\n\n===Operation===\n[[File:Hookah-lookthrough.svg|thumb|upright|Hookah cross-section view]]\n[[File:Small Argileh.jpg|right|thumb|A small hookah]]\nThe jar at the bottom of the hookah is filled with water sufficient to submerge a few centimeters of the body tube, which is sealed tightly to it. Deeper water will only increase the inhalation force needed to use it. Tobacco or tobacco-free molasses are placed inside the bowl at the top of the hookah.

It bubbles up through the water, losing heat, and fills the top part of the jar, to which the hose is attached. When a smoker inhales from the hose, smoke passes into the lungs, and the change in pressure in the jar pulls more air through the charcoal, continuing the process.\n\nIf the hookah has been lit and smoked but has not been inhaled for an extended period, the smoke inside the water jar may be regarded as \"stale\" and undesirable. Stale smoke may be exhausted through the purge valve, if present. This one-way valve is opened by the positive pressure created from gently blowing into the hose. It will not function on a multiple-hose hookah unless all other hoses are plugged. Sometimes one-way valves are put in the hose sockets to avoid the need to manually plug hoses.\n\n==Health effects==\n{{Further|Health effects of tobacco|Mu\u2018assel#Health effects}}\n\n=== Exposure to pathogens that cause infectious diseases ===\nWhen people share a hookah, there is a risk of spreading infectious diseases such as [[oral herpes]], [[tuberculosis]], [[hepatitis]], [[influenza]], and ''[[Helicobacter pylori|H. pylori]]''.<ref name=\"ALAgrowingThreat\">{{cite web |publisher=American Lung Association |url=http://www.lung.org/assets/documents/tobacco/hookah-policy-brief-updated.pdf |title=Hookah Smoking \u2014 A Growing Threat to Public Health |accessdate=27 June 2018}}</ref> Using personal disposable mouthpieces may reduce this risk but does not eliminate it.<ref>{{cite web |title=Waterpipe and Hookah Smoking - A Dangerous New Trend |date=30 October 2015 |publisher=Simcoe Muskoka District Health Unit |url=http://www.simcoemuskokahealth.org/Topics/Tobacco/TobaccoUsePrevention/HookahsAndWaterpipes.aspx |access-date=13 June 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160625062356/http://www.simcoemuskokahealth.org/Topics/Tobacco/TobaccoUsePrevention/HookahsAndWaterpipes.aspx |archive-date=25 June 2016 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n=== Exposure to toxic chemicals ===\nHookah smoke contains multiple toxic chemicals.<ref name=Akl10 /> Water does not filter out many of these chemicals.<ref name=Akl10>{{cite journal|last1=Akl|first1=EA|last2=Gaddam|first2=S|last3=Gunukula|first3=SK|last4=Honeine|first4=R|last5=Jaoude|first5=PA|last6=Irani|first6=J|title=The effects of waterpipe tobacco smoking on health outcomes: a systematic review|journal=International Journal of Epidemiology|date=2010|volume=39|issue=3|pages=834\u201357|pmid=20207606|doi=10.1093/ije/dyq002|doi-access=free}}<!--|accessdate=13 June 2015--></ref> Hookah smoke contains toxic chemicals that come from the burning of the charcoal, tobacco, and flavorings.

Gypsy feels lonely due to a barrage of medical issues, yet she befriends Lacey, a teenager who visits them. Mel (Lacey's mother) watches Dee Dee and Gypsy steal a necklace from a mall; later, with the intention of buying Mel's silence, Dee Dee plans a party at her house inviting all neighbors. As Dee Dee explains the issues of raising her daughter alone to Mel, she sees Gypsy eating frosting from a cupcake and rushes her immediately to the hospital, claiming Gypsy is allergic to sugar. Mel suddenly feels sympathy for Dee Dee's hardships, so the two women make peace that same night. Gypsy hears the doctor telling her mother she is not allergic to sugar. That night, she walks to the kitchen (despite being equipped to a wheelchair) and eats whipped cream, waiting to see if she presents any of the symptoms of [[anaphylaxis]] that her mother has warned her about.  Instead, it proves her mother lied to her. As Gypsy walks back to bed, she is startled when seeing her mother is awake and tells her she was thirsty. Gypsy goes to bed again, connected to a machine by Dee Dee, as she sings to her. The episode shows that Dee Dee has been found dead, Gypsy is gone, and the police are investigating on June 14, 2015.\n |LineColor       = 734F54\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber   = 2\n |Title           = Teeth\n |DirectedBy      = Laure de Clermont-Tonnerre\n |WrittenBy       = Dan Dietz\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2019|3|20}}\n |ShortSummary    = In 2009, Gypsy starts sneaking at night to eat sugary foods while watching make-up videos, bringing about a visit to the dentist where all her teeth are removed, due to them rotting from the medications that Dee Dee gave her. This causes her to resist attending an award ceremony to receive an award Gypsy won (nominated by her mother), but Dee Dee forces her to go, providing her with dentures so she feels better. Dr. Lakshmi Chandra, a new doctor who is seeing Gypsy, suspects her medical records are not correct and begins contacting other hospitals to see if they are true. The doctor reports Gypsy's situation to [[Child Protective Services]], which freaks out Dee Dee, causing her to give Gypsy sleeping pills, making her appear disoriented and dizzy when she speaks to the social worker.  Believing it was Mel who reported her to CPS, Dee Dee confronts her; however, Mel explains it wasn't her and comforts Dee Dee by reassuring her that she is a good mother. In the present day, Lacey tells her mother and the police that Gypsy had a secret Facebook account, which she used to get romantically involved with young men, probably hinting that Gypsy had a boyfriend involved in Dee Dee's murder and her own disappearance.\n |LineColor       = 734F54\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber   = 3\n |Title           = Two Wolverines\n |DirectedBy      = [[Adam Arkin]]\n |WrittenBy       = [[Robin Veith]]\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2019|3|27}}\n |ShortSummary    = In 2011, Dee Dee makes Gypsy play dress-up for a costume convention, where they each attract charming men wearing Wolverine costumes who could complicate their insular relationship; Gypsy is attracted to a guy named Scott while a man named Russ has an attraction for Dee Dee (both men were dressed as [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]]). Gypsy steals money and buys a phone used to text Scott, and creates a secret Facebook account after discovering her mother has lied about her age, claiming she is fifteen (born in 1995) but her legal birth certificate states she was born in 1991. Scott has an accident at the hospital and Gypsy visits him wearing a red wig Scott got for her (as a reference to [[Jean Grey]]), but not before leaving a note to her mom saying she left to be married to her prince charming, signed \"your nineteen year old daughter\". Gypsy later goes to Scott's house where Dee Dee arrives later and threatens her to create a scene if she doesn't go with her, while also telling Scott that Gypsy is 14.

Dee Dee wants to get legal guardianship of Gypsy, however it isn't easy as she'll only get it if Gypsy is incapacitated and she has to agree to it. Dee Dee is diagnosed with diabetes, and while she's feeling sick Gypsy buys a laptop without her mother finding out, creating an account on a Christian dating website (being instructed by Lacey), where she meets Nick Godejohn, who claims to have a dark side. Dee Dee makes Gypsy sign the guardianship documents, promising Gypsy she can protect her from all the lies they have invented and she won't go to jail (since she is now 18 and could face legal consequences as an adult). As time goes by, Nick and Gypsy get along well together, with the former introducing her to [[BDSM]]. The next morning, Gypsy falls asleep with the laptop, and when Dee Dee sees it, she smashes it with a hammer, even though Gypsy states she'll just get a new one. As a result, Dee Dee tries to tie her hands but Gypsy frees herself by spitting on Dee Dee; even though she has a chance to leave, she comes back to her mother and takes care of her, considering Gypsy \"her angel\". That night, Gypsy texts Nick telling him about her computer, Nick assures her he will protect her.

Gypsy and Nick have sex for the first time in the bathroom. When Gypsy and Dee Dee arrive home, Nick calls and tells Dee Dee that he loves Gypsy and they have been in love for several years. Dee Dee ties Gypsy's hands to the bed. With their plan gone disastrously wrong, Gypsy tells Nick that she needs Victor (Nick's dark side) to kill her mother because she can't do it alone, so he agrees and travels back to her.

When Gypsy is two years old, Dee Dee is arrested for check fraud and goes to jail for sixty days, while her mother is the one who takes care of Gypsy. When Dee Dee comes back, she gives Gypsy cough medicine insisting she has a fever even though Emma insists she's fine. In the present day, Gypsy is disappointed when she discovers Nick only bought one return-ticket to his hometown; therefore, they must wait two days to leave. When Gypsy is six, Emma's health is getting worse but Dee Dee neglects her until she finally dies. After Emma dies, Dee Dee discovers that Emma never gave the letters she wrote to Gypsy while being in prison. Gypsy has an accident falling from a trampoline and when they come back from the hospital, Dee Dee places her in a wheelchair.

When Gypsy arrives at the Godejohns' house, she sees that Nick's mother Stephanie and his father Vance don't take care of him as much as Dee Dee cares for her. With a lack of food in the house, Gypsy and Nick head to the supermarket, while the former pretends to have a sprained ankle, giving her an opportunity to use an electric scooter and steal mashed potatoes-mix while Nick distracts a worker. Later, at the house, Gypsy feels remorse over her mother's death. Since Dee Dee's body has not yet been found, she and Nick post comments on Facebook about the murder. Lacey sees the posts and immediately contacts Mel. However, Nick and Gypsy forgot to disable the location, resulting in local police dramatically-raiding the Godejohns' house later that night. The couple is interrogated separately. Nick accepts his blame and says he did it because he loves Gypsy, while being aware of his recent charge in 2013 for masturbating at a [[McDonald's]] restaurant for 9 hours while watching porn. Gypsy maintains she had no idea Nick was going to kill Dee Dee. When Lacey and Mel see Gypsy on TV, they are shocked to see that she can walk, much to Mel's anger that they were betrayed for several years. Gypsy's trial begins. She bursts into tears when she learns that she will be sentenced to life in prison or the death penalty if she pleads guilty for Dee Dee's murder.\n |LineColor       = 734F54\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber   = 8\n |Title           = Free\n |DirectedBy      = Steven Piet\n |WrittenBy       = Nick Antosca, Michelle Dean & Lisa Long\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2019|5|1}}\n |ShortSummary    = Gypsy fights for her life by defending her actions, while Mel and Lacey realize that behind closed doors things were not always as they seemed. Gypsy's lawyer states that she has to prove she is innocent to the state of Missouri or else she will be killed, and instructs her to provide all available medical records since birth.  While in prison, Gypsy gains weight.  The prison doctor removes her feeding tube, telling her, \"You are one of the healthiest people in here.\"  Nick tells Gypsy that Bonnie and Clyde both died together, which upsets her. Gypsy later calls Lacey to ask if she could visit, but Lacey replies that she may, as she acts in a confused or unhelpful manner, so Gypsy calls her father to visit her with the medical records needed for evidence. When Rod Blanchard, Gypsy's father and Dee Dee's ex-husband, arrives, Gypsy freaks out over believing that he never loved her or wanted to be in her life, until he shows her happy pictures of them together when she was a small child. Gypsy's lawyer asks the judge to try Gypsy separately from Nick, as both had different motives in the murder. The motion is granted, upsetting Nick because he claims he only did it to be with her. Mel arrives at the prison, instead of Lacey, telling Gypsy that she can't see Lacey as she tries to get out of jail; she and Lacey have decided not to continue association with Gypsy. In a flashback to the night of Dee Dee's murder, Gypsy's last conversation with her mother is  shown, remembering when Gypsy was scared with the [[spanish moss]] resembling ghosts and Dee Dee telling her to look at the stars as they are angels who take care of them (the flashback is shown at the beginning of the episode when Gypsy was six). When Dee Dee is asleep, Gypsy lets Nick in and proceeds with the plan to kill Dee Dee. After Nick stabs her while Gypsy was in the bathroom, the two have sex, and they leave the house before Gypsy states that she didn't want to see Dee Dee's body. The final scene shows Gypsy tilting her head on Dee Dee's shoulder in her cell, believing that she still loves her despite what she went through. Subtitles reveal that Gypsy is currently serving a 10-year sentence, and stated that she will start a family after she gets out, while Nick is currently serving a life sentence without parole.\n |LineColor       = 734F54\n}}\n}}\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\nOn July 21, 2017, [[Hulu]] confirmed it had put the production into development.

Gypsy feels lonely due to a barrage of medical issues, yet she befriends Lacey, a teenager who visits them. Mel (Lacey's mother) watches Dee Dee and Gypsy steal a necklace from a mall; later, with the intention of buying Mel's silence, Dee Dee plans a party at her house inviting all neighbors. As Dee Dee explains the issues of raising her daughter alone to Mel, she sees Gypsy eating frosting from a cupcake and rushes her immediately to the hospital, claiming Gypsy is allergic to sugar. Mel suddenly feels sympathy for Dee Dee's hardships, so the two women make peace that same night. Gypsy hears the doctor telling her mother she is not allergic to sugar. That night, she walks to the kitchen (despite being equipped to a wheelchair) and eats whipped cream, waiting to see if she presents any of the symptoms of [[anaphylaxis]] that her mother has warned her about.  Instead, it proves her mother lied to her. As Gypsy walks back to bed, she is startled when seeing her mother is awake and tells her she was thirsty. Gypsy goes to bed again, connected to a machine by Dee Dee, as she sings to her. The episode shows that Dee Dee has been found dead, Gypsy is gone, and the police are investigating on June 14, 2015.\n |LineColor       = 734F54\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber   = 2\n |Title           = Teeth\n |DirectedBy      = Laure de Clermont-Tonnerre\n |WrittenBy       = Dan Dietz\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2019|3|20}}\n |ShortSummary    = In 2009, Gypsy starts sneaking at night to eat sugary foods while watching make-up videos, bringing about a visit to the dentist where all her teeth are removed, due to them rotting from the medications that Dee Dee gave her. This causes her to resist attending an award ceremony to receive an award Gypsy won (nominated by her mother), but Dee Dee forces her to go, providing her with dentures so she feels better. Dr. Lakshmi Chandra, a new doctor who is seeing Gypsy, suspects her medical records are not correct and begins contacting other hospitals to see if they are true. The doctor reports Gypsy's situation to [[Child Protective Services]], which freaks out Dee Dee, causing her to give Gypsy sleeping pills, making her appear disoriented and dizzy when she speaks to the social worker.  Believing it was Mel who reported her to CPS, Dee Dee confronts her; however, Mel explains it wasn't her and comforts Dee Dee by reassuring her that she is a good mother. In the present day, Lacey tells her mother and the police that Gypsy had a secret Facebook account, which she used to get romantically involved with young men, probably hinting that Gypsy had a boyfriend involved in Dee Dee's murder and her own disappearance.\n |LineColor       = 734F54\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber   = 3\n |Title           = Two Wolverines\n |DirectedBy      = [[Adam Arkin]]\n |WrittenBy       = [[Robin Veith]]\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2019|3|27}}\n |ShortSummary    = In 2011, Dee Dee makes Gypsy play dress-up for a costume convention, where they each attract charming men wearing Wolverine costumes who could complicate their insular relationship; Gypsy is attracted to a guy named Scott while a man named Russ has an attraction for Dee Dee (both men were dressed as [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]]). Gypsy steals money and buys a phone used to text Scott, and creates a secret Facebook account after discovering her mother has lied about her age, claiming she is fifteen (born in 1995) but her legal birth certificate states she was born in 1991. Scott has an accident at the hospital and Gypsy visits him wearing a red wig Scott got for her (as a reference to [[Jean Grey]]), but not before leaving a note to her mom saying she left to be married to her prince charming, signed \"your nineteen year old daughter\". Gypsy later goes to Scott's house where Dee Dee arrives later and threatens her to create a scene if she doesn't go with her, while also telling Scott that Gypsy is 14. When they arrive home, Gypsy is scared as she sees her mother's angry look when she forces her to come out of the van in a wheelchair.\n |LineColor       = 734F54\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber   = 4\n |Title           = Stay Inside\n |DirectedBy      = Christina Choe\n |WrittenBy       = Michelle Dean\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2019|4|3}}\n |ShortSummary    = In 2013, Gypsy starts her sexual awakening, seeing a guy who mows the lawn, and gets interested in dating as Lacey tells her about her new boyfriend. Dee Dee wants to get legal guardianship of Gypsy, however it isn't easy as she'll only get it if Gypsy is incapacitated and she has to agree to it. Dee Dee is diagnosed with diabetes, and while she's feeling sick Gypsy buys a laptop without her mother finding out, creating an account on a Christian dating website (being instructed by Lacey), where she meets Nick Godejohn, who claims to have a dark side. Dee Dee makes Gypsy sign the guardianship documents, promising Gypsy she can protect her from all the lies they have invented and she won't go to jail (since she is now 18 and could face legal consequences as an adult). As time goes by, Nick and Gypsy get along well together, with the former introducing her to [[BDSM]]. The next morning, Gypsy falls asleep with the laptop, and when Dee Dee sees it, she smashes it with a hammer, even though Gypsy states she'll just get a new one. As a result, Dee Dee tries to tie her hands but Gypsy frees herself by spitting on Dee Dee; even though she has a chance to leave, she comes back to her mother and takes care of her, considering Gypsy \"her angel\". That night, Gypsy texts Nick telling him about her computer, Nick assures her he will protect her. Gypsy then asks \"from anyone?\", as the episode ends with her masturbating on the floor.\n |LineColor       = 734F54\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber   = 5\n |Title           = Plan B\n |DirectedBy      = Steven Piet\n |WrittenBy       = Nick Antosca & Lisa Long\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2019|4|10}}\n |ShortSummary    = In 2015, Gypsy and Nick scheme to meet in person and hope to win Dee Dee's approval. The next day, Dee Dee and Gypsy go to the movies and watch ''[[Cinderella (2015 Disney film)|Cinderella]]'', but Dee Dee feels creeped out by Nick, who follows them inside the movie theater. Gypsy and Nick have sex for the first time in the bathroom. When Gypsy and Dee Dee arrive home, Nick calls and tells Dee Dee that he loves Gypsy and they have been in love for several years. Dee Dee ties Gypsy's hands to the bed. With their plan gone disastrously wrong, Gypsy tells Nick that she needs Victor (Nick's dark side) to kill her mother because she can't do it alone, so he agrees and travels back to her. Gypsy buys a fishing knife and starts packing when she receives a message from Nick saying he's there.\n |LineColor       = 734F54\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber   = 6\n |Title           = A Whole New World\n |DirectedBy      = Laure de Clermont-Tonnerre\n |WrittenBy       = Heather Marion\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2019|4|17}}\n |ShortSummary    = While Gypsy and Nick are on the run following Dee Dee's murder, flashbacks to a much younger Dee Dee reveal how trauma with her own mother, Emma, set her up for conflict with Gypsy, as the two of them have different ideas about raising her. When Gypsy is two years old, Dee Dee is arrested for check fraud and goes to jail for sixty days, while her mother is the one who takes care of Gypsy. When Dee Dee comes back, she gives Gypsy cough medicine insisting she has a fever even though Emma insists she's fine. In the present day, Gypsy is disappointed when she discovers Nick only bought one return-ticket to his hometown; therefore, they must wait two days to leave. When Gypsy is six, Emma's health is getting worse but Dee Dee neglects her until she finally dies. After Emma dies, Dee Dee discovers that Emma never gave the letters she wrote to Gypsy while being in prison. Gypsy has an accident falling from a trampoline and when they come back from the hospital, Dee Dee places her in a wheelchair. Back in the present day, Gypsy leaves with Nick to [[Wisconsin]].\n |LineColor       = 734F54\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber   = 7\n |Title           = Bonnie & Clyde\n |DirectedBy      = [[Hannah Fidell]]\n |WrittenBy       = Dan Dietz & Robin Veith\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2019|4|24}}\n |ShortSummary    = Gypsy is excited to start over with Nick in Wisconsin, but their new life doesn't match the happily-ever-after she imagined, and her anxiety worsens as past transgressions begin to catch up with them. When Gypsy arrives at the Godejohns' house, she sees that Nick's mother Stephanie and his father Vance don't take care of him as much as Dee Dee cares for her. With a lack of food in the house, Gypsy and Nick head to the supermarket, while the former pretends to have a sprained ankle, giving her an opportunity to use an electric scooter and steal mashed potatoes-mix while Nick distracts a worker. Later, at the house, Gypsy feels remorse over her mother's death. Since Dee Dee's body has not yet been found, she and Nick post comments on Facebook about the murder. Lacey sees the posts and immediately contacts Mel. However, Nick and Gypsy forgot to disable the location, resulting in local police dramatically-raiding the Godejohns' house later that night. The couple is interrogated separately. Nick accepts his blame and says he did it because he loves Gypsy, while being aware of his recent charge in 2013 for masturbating at a [[McDonald's]] restaurant for 9 hours while watching porn. Gypsy maintains she had no idea Nick was going to kill Dee Dee. When Lacey and Mel see Gypsy on TV, they are shocked to see that she can walk, much to Mel's anger that they were betrayed for several years. Gypsy's trial begins. She bursts into tears when she learns that she will be sentenced to life in prison or the death penalty if she pleads guilty for Dee Dee's murder.\n |LineColor       = 734F54\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber   = 8\n |Title           = Free\n |DirectedBy      = Steven Piet\n |WrittenBy       = Nick Antosca, Michelle Dean & Lisa Long\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2019|5|1}}\n |ShortSummary    = Gypsy fights for her life by defending her actions, while Mel and Lacey realize that behind closed doors things were not always as they seemed. Gypsy's lawyer states that she has to prove she is innocent to the state of Missouri or else she will be killed, and instructs her to provide all available medical records since birth.  While in prison, Gypsy gains weight.  The prison doctor removes her feeding tube, telling her, \"You are one of the healthiest people in here.\"  Nick tells Gypsy that Bonnie and Clyde both died together, which upsets her. Gypsy later calls Lacey to ask if she could visit, but Lacey replies that she may, as she acts in a confused or unhelpful manner, so Gypsy calls her father to visit her with the medical records needed for evidence. When Rod Blanchard, Gypsy's father and Dee Dee's ex-husband, arrives, Gypsy freaks out over believing that he never loved her or wanted to be in her life, until he shows her happy pictures of them together when she was a small child. Gypsy's lawyer asks the judge to try Gypsy separately from Nick, as both had different motives in the murder. The motion is granted, upsetting Nick because he claims he only did it to be with her. Mel arrives at the prison, instead of Lacey, telling Gypsy that she can't see Lacey as she tries to get out of jail; she and Lacey have decided not to continue association with Gypsy. In a flashback to the night of Dee Dee's murder, Gypsy's last conversation with her mother is  shown, remembering when Gypsy was scared with the [[spanish moss]] resembling ghosts and Dee Dee telling her to look at the stars as they are angels who take care of them (the flashback is shown at the beginning of the episode when Gypsy was six). When Dee Dee is asleep, Gypsy lets Nick in and proceeds with the plan to kill Dee Dee. After Nick stabs her while Gypsy was in the bathroom, the two both have sex, and they leave the house before Gypsy states that she didn't want to see Dee Dee's body. The final scene shows Gypsy tilting her head on Dee Dee's shoulder in her cell, believing that she still loves her despite what she went through. Subtitles reveal that Gypsy is currently serving a 10-year sentence, and stated that she will start a family after she gets out, while Nick is currently serving a life sentence without parole.\n |LineColor       = 734F54\n}}\n}}\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\nOn July 21, 2017, [[Hulu]] confirmed it had put the production into development.

He asks to be let out before reaching his home and walks quickly around the corner and out of driver's sight.\n\n===Main story===\nHoward calls Jimmy and Kim about the fire at Chuck's, and they arrive as Chuck's body is taken away. Jimmy sees the appliances outside Chuck's home and realizes his electromagnetic hypersensitivity symptoms returned. He falls into a deep depression which Kim tries to help him out of. Howard takes on the responsibility of arranging Chuck's funeral.\n\nMike receives his first payment from Madrigal Electromotive as a contracted security consultant, which Gus arranged to launder the money Mike stole from the Salamancas. Though meant to be a paper transaction, Mike enters a Madrigal facility, performs a detailed security audit, and turns the results over to the facility manager with instructions to let Lydia know he was there.\n\nAn ambulance comes to take Hector to the hospital after he suffers a stroke at a meeting with Juan Bolsa, Gus and Nacho. Following Mike's advice, Nacho takes the fake capsules containing [[ibuprofen]] from Hector and replaces them with Hector's real [[nitroglycerin]]. He tries to dispose of the fakes but is interrupted by Gus, who says they need to meet with Juan Bolsa immediately. Bolsa puts Nacho and Arturo in charge of the Salamanca operation for the time being. Afterwards, Nacho drives to a bridge and throws the ibuprofen away, unaware Victor has followed him.\n\nSeveral of Chuck's friends and associates attend his funeral and give Jimmy their condolences. After the service, Howard tells Jimmy and Kim he believes Chuck relapsed because Howard forced him out of HHM, so he feels responsible for Chuck's death. Kim is shocked as Jimmy lets Howard shoulder the blame and immediately regains his happy-go-lucky demeanor.\n\n==Production==\nIn the opening scene, Saul is at his workplace, a [[Cinnabon]] mall store.

As Gene leaves, the receptionist stops him due to confusion over adding his billing information to the hospital database. Gene is apprehensive, but the receptionist quickly solves the problem. Gene takes a taxi home, but becomes uneasy when he recognizes the driver is making eye contact and he sees an [[Albuquerque Isotopes]] air freshener on the rear view mirror. He asks to be let out before reaching his home and walks quickly around the corner and out of driver's sight.\n\n===Main story===\nHoward calls Jimmy and Kim about the fire at Chuck's, and they arrive as Chuck's body is taken away. Jimmy sees the appliances outside Chuck's home and realizes his electromagnetic hypersensitivity symptoms returned. He falls into a deep depression which Kim tries to help him out of. Howard takes on the responsibility of arranging Chuck's funeral.\n\nMike receives his first payment from Madrigal Electromotive as a contracted security consultant, which Gus arranged to launder the money Mike stole from the Salamancas. Though meant to be a paper transaction, Mike enters a Madrigal facility, performs a detailed security audit, and turns the results over to the facility manager with instructions to let Lydia know he was there.\n\nAn ambulance comes to take Hector to the hospital after he suffers a stroke at a meeting with Juan Bolsa, Gus and Nacho. Following Mike's advice, Nacho takes the fake capsules containing [[ibuprofen]] from Hector and replaces them with Hector's real [[nitroglycerin]]. He tries to dispose of the fakes but is interrupted by Gus, who says they need to meet with Juan Bolsa immediately. Bolsa puts Nacho and Arturo in charge of the Salamanca operation for the time being. Afterwards, Nacho drives to a bridge and throws the ibuprofen away, unaware Victor has followed him.\n\nSeveral of Chuck's friends and associates attend his funeral and give Jimmy their condolences. After the service, Howard tells Jimmy and Kim he believes Chuck relapsed because Howard forced him out of HHM, so he feels responsible for Chuck's death. Kim is shocked as Jimmy lets Howard shoulder the blame and immediate regains his happy-go-lucky demeanor.\n\n==Production==\nIn the opening scene, Saul is at his workplace, a [[Cinnabon]] mall store.
