During the ritual, various physiological acts are interpreted, including the sexual act, as a symbol of the god's sacred marriage, while the symbolical wife, appearing pregnant, mimes the pains of giving birth. This ritual inaugurates the labours of the fields ([[ploughing]], [[sowing]]) and is carried out with the participation of numerous allegorical personages, among which is the Emperor and his entourage.<ref name=\"Kernbach\">Kernbach, Victor (1989).

Priape'') is a North American new religion that centres on the worship of the phallus.  Founded in the 1980s in Montreal, Quebec, by D. F. Cassidy, it has a following mainly among homosexual men in Canada and the United States.  Semen is also treated with reverence and its consumption is an act of worship.<ref>J. Gordon Melton (1996, 5th ed.). Encyclopedia of American Religions (Detroit, Mich.: Gale) {{ISBN|0-8103-7714-4}} p. 952.</ref> Semen is esteemed as sacred because of its divine life-giving power.\n\n==Psychoanalysis==\n[[File:Phallic-Head Plate, 1536 .jpg|170px|thumb|Phallic-Head Plate, [[Gubbio, Italy]], 1536]]\nThe symbolic version of the phallus, a phallic symbol is meant to represent male generative powers. According to [[Sigmund Freud]]'s theory of [[psychoanalysis]], while males possess a penis, no one can possess the symbolic phallus. [[Jacques Lacan]]'s ''Ecrits: A Selection'' includes an essay titled ''The Signification of the Phallus'' in which sexual differentiation is represented in terms of the difference between \"being\" and \"having\" the phallus, which for Lacan is the transcendent signifier of desire. Men are positioned as men insofar as they wish to ''have'' the phallus. Women, on the other hand, wish to ''be'' the phallus.  This difference between having and being explains some tragicomic aspects of sexual life.  Once a woman becomes, in the realm of the signifier, the phallus the man wants, he ceases to want it, because one cannot desire what one has, and the man may be drawn to other women. Similarly, though, for the woman, the gift of the phallus deprives the man of what he has, and thereby diminishes her desire.\n\nIn ''Gender Trouble'', [[Judith Butler]] explores Freud's and Lacan's discussions of the symbolic phallus by pointing out the connection between the phallus and the penis. She writes, \"The law requires conformity to its own notion of 'nature'. It gains its legitimacy through the binary and asymmetrical naturalization of bodies in which the phallus, though clearly not identical to the penis, deploys the penis as its naturalized instrument and sign\". In ''Bodies that Matter'', she further explores the possibilities for the phallus in her discussion of ''The Lesbian Phallus''. If, as she notes, Freud enumerates a set of analogies and substitutions that rhetorically affirm the fundamental transferability of the phallus from the penis elsewhere, then any number of other things might come to stand in for the phallus.\n\n==Modern use of the phallus==\nThe phallus is often used to advertise [[pornography]], as well as the sale of [[contraception]]. It has often been used in provocative practical jokes<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thecrimson.com/article.aspx?ref=525595|title=Yale Band Punished for Half-Time Show|work=The Harvard Crimson|accessdate=2008-12-01}}</ref> and has been the central focus of adult-audience performances.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/2002/11/01/DD88346.DTL|title=Puppetry of the Penis|work=San Francisco Chronicle|accessdate=2008-12-01 | first=Robert | last=Hurwitt|date=2002-11-01}}</ref>\n\nThe phallus had a new set of art interpretations in the 20th century with the rise of [[Sigmund Freud]], the founder of modern [[psychoanalysis]] of [[psychology]].  One example is \"[[Princess X]]\"<ref>[http://www.philamuseum.org/collections/permanent/51035.html Philamuseum.org]</ref> by the Romanian modernist sculptor [[Constantin Br\u00e2ncu\u0219i]]. He created a scandal in the Salon in 1919 when he represented or caricatured  [[Princess Marie Bonaparte]] as a large gleaming bronze phallus. This phallus likely symbolizes Bonaparte's obsession with the penis and her lifelong quest to achieve vaginal orgasm.<ref>{{cite book | author=[[Mary Roach]] | title=[[Bonk: The Curious Coupling of Science and Sex]] | publisher=W.

In Bulgaria, a ritual spectacle of spring (a sort of [[carnival]] performed by [[Kukeri]]) takes place after a scenario of folk theatre, in which Kuker's role is interpreted by a man attired in a sheep- or goat-pelt, wearing a horned mask and girded with a large wooden phallus. During the ritual, various physiological acts are interpreted, including the sexual act, as a symbol of the god's sacred marriage, while the symbolical wife, appearing pregnant, mimes the pains of giving birth. This ritual inaugurates the labours of the fields ([[ploughing]], [[sowing]]) and is carried out with the participation of numerous allegorical personages, among which is the Emperor and his entourage.<ref name=\"Kernbach\">Kernbach, Victor (1989).

Priape'') is a North American new religion that centres on the worship of the phallus.  Founded in the 1980s in Montreal, Quebec, by D. F. Cassidy, it has a following mainly among homosexual men in Canada and the United States.  Semen is also treated with reverence and its consumption is an act of worship.<ref>J. Gordon Melton (1996, 5th ed.). Encyclopedia of American Religions (Detroit, Mich.: Gale) {{ISBN|0-8103-7714-4}} p. 952.</ref> Semen is esteemed as sacred because of its divine life-giving power.\n\n==Psychoanalysis==\n[[File:Phallic-Head Plate, 1536 .jpg|170px|thumb|Phallic-Head Plate, [[Gubbio, Italy]], 1536]]\nThe symbolic version of the phallus, a phallic symbol is meant to represent male generative powers. According to [[Sigmund Freud]]'s theory of [[psychoanalysis]], while males possess a penis, no one can possess the symbolic phallus. [[Jacques Lacan]]'s ''Ecrits: A Selection'' includes an essay titled ''The Signification of the Phallus'' in which sexual differentiation is represented in terms of the difference between \"being\" and \"having\" the phallus, which for Lacan is the transcendent signifier of desire. Men are positioned as men insofar as they wish to ''have'' the phallus. Women, on the other hand, wish to ''be'' the phallus.  This difference between having and being explains some tragicomic aspects of sexual life.  Once a woman becomes, in the realm of the signifier, the phallus the man wants, he ceases to want it, because one cannot desire what one has, and the man may be drawn to other women. Similarly, though, for the woman, the gift of the phallus deprives the man of what he has, and thereby diminishes her desire.\n\nIn ''Gender Trouble'', [[Judith Butler]] explores Freud's and Lacan's discussions of the symbolic phallus by pointing out the connection between the phallus and the penis. She writes, \"The law requires conformity to its own notion of 'nature'. It gains its legitimacy through the binary and asymmetrical naturalization of bodies in which the phallus, though clearly not identical to the penis, deploys the penis as its naturalized instrument and sign\". In ''Bodies that Matter'', she further explores the possibilities for the phallus in her discussion of ''The Lesbian Phallus''. If, as she notes, Freud enumerates a set of analogies and substitutions that rhetorically affirm the fundamental transferability of the phallus from the penis elsewhere, then any number of other things might come to stand in for the phallus.\n\n==Modern use of the phallus==\nThe phallus is often used to advertise [[pornography]], as well as the sale of [[contraception]]. It has often been used in provocative practical jokes<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thecrimson.com/article.aspx?ref=525595|title=Yale Band Punished for Half-Time Show|work=The Harvard Crimson|accessdate=2008-12-01}}</ref> and has been the central focus of adult-audience performances.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/2002/11/01/DD88346.DTL|title=Puppetry of the Penis|work=San Francisco Chronicle|accessdate=2008-12-01 | first=Robert | last=Hurwitt|date=2002-11-01}}</ref>\n\nThe phallus had a new set of art interpretations in the 20th century with the rise of [[Sigmund Freud]], the founder of modern [[psychoanalysis]] of [[psychology]].  One example is \"[[Princess X]]\"<ref>[http://www.philamuseum.org/collections/permanent/51035.html Philamuseum.org]</ref> by the Romanian modernist sculptor [[Constantin Br\u00e2ncu\u0219i]]. He created a scandal in the Salon in 1919 when he represented or caricatured  [[Princess Marie Bonaparte]] as a large gleaming bronze phallus. This phallus likely symbolizes Bonaparte's obsession with the penis and her lifelong quest to achieve vaginal orgasm.<ref>{{cite book | author=[[Mary Roach]] | title=[[Bonk: The Curious Coupling of Science and Sex]] | publisher=W.

Macdonald was a trailblazer in Canadian art from the 1930s to 1960. He was the first painter to exhibit abstract art in Vancouver, and throughout his life he championed Canadian avant-garde artists at home and abroad.

The WHO officially removed Toronto from its list of infected areas by the end of June 2003.<ref>{{cite book |last=Low |first=Donald |authorlink=Donald Low |date=2004 |title=Learning from SARS: Preparing for the Next Disease Outbreak: Workshop Summary}}</ref>\n\nThe official response by the Ontario provincial government and Canadian federal government has been widely criticized in the years following the outbreak. Brian Schwartz, vice-chair of Ontario's SARS Scientific Advisory Committee, described public health officials' preparedness and emergency response at the time of the outbreak as \"very, very basic and minimal at best\".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/health/mers-outbreak-3-lessons-canada-learned-from-sars-1.3109550|title=Is Canada ready for MERS? 3 lessons learned from SARS|website=www.cbc.ca|access-date=11 May 2016}}</ref> Critics of the response often cite poorly outlined and enforced protocol for protecting healthcare workers and identifying infected patients as a major contributing factor to the continued spread of the virus. The atmosphere of fear and uncertainty surrounding the outbreak resulted in staffing issues in area hospitals when healthcare workers elected to resign rather than risk exposure to SARS.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}\n\n===Identification of virus===\nIn late February 2003, Italian doctor [[Carlo Urbani]] was called into [[L'H\u00f4pital Fran\u00e7ais De Hano\u00ef|The French Hospital of Hanoi]] to look at Johnny Chen, an American businessman who had fallen ill with what doctors thought was a bad case of [[influenza]]. Urbani realized that Chen's ailment was probably a new and highly contagious disease. He immediately notified the WHO. He also persuaded the [[Ministry of Health (Vietnam)|Vietnamese Health Ministry]] to begin isolating patients and screening travelers, thus slowing the early pace of the epidemic. He subsequently contracted the disease himself, and died in March 2003.\n\nThe CDC and Canada's National Microbiology Laboratory identified the SARS [[genome]] in April 2003.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.cdc.gov/about/history/sars/feature.htm |title=Remembering SARS: A Deadly Puzzle and the Efforts to Solve It |date=11 April 2013 |accessdate=3 August 2013 |publisher=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/mediacentre/releases/2003/pr31/en/ |title=Coronavirus never before seen in humans is the cause of SARS |publisher=United Nations World Health Organization |date=16 April 2006 |accessdate=5 July 2006}}</ref> Scientists at [[Erasmus University]] in [[Rotterdam]], the Netherlands demonstrated that the SARS coronavirus fulfilled [[Koch's postulates]] thereby confirming it as the causative agent.

The results found that the SARS coronavirus could be isolated from [[masked palm civet]]s (''Paguma'' sp.), even if the animals did not show clinical signs of the virus. The preliminary conclusion was the SARS virus crossed the [[xenographic]] barrier from [[asian palm civet]] to humans, and more than 10,000 masked palm civets were killed in Guangdong Province. The virus was also later found in [[raccoon dog]]s (''Nyctereuteus'' sp.), [[ferret badger]]s (''Melogale'' spp.), and domestic cats.

The bats did not show any visible signs of disease but are the likely natural reservoirs of SARS-like coronaviruses. In late 2006, scientists from the Chinese Centre for Disease Control and Prevention of [[Hong Kong University]] and the Guangzhou Centre for Disease Control and Prevention established a genetic link between the SARS coronavirus appearing in civets and humans, bearing out claims that the disease had jumped across species.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/china/2006-11/23/content_740511.htm |title=Scientists prove SARS-civet cat link |work=China Daily |date=23 November 2006}}</ref>\n\nIn December 2017, \"after years of searching across China, where the disease first emerged, researchers reported ... that they had found a remote cave in Yunnan province, which is home to horseshoe bats that carry a strain of a particular virus known as a coronavirus.

After a series of 3 trial matches on 27 June both the New Zealand team and Auckland teams were selected. Officials had declared that \"give us fine weather and we will get an attendance of 20,000\". Unfortunately the weather did not oblige and it was in fact described as \"the worst experienced this season ... in one place there was a miniature lake.\" This resulted in a crowd many times smaller, however thousands came into the ground to watch the main match between North Island and South Island, won by the former 27 points to 9.<ref>{{cite news \n| title =The Minor Trial Games/A Win for South Auckland/Play Marred by the Rain\n| page =12 \n| work= [[The New Zealand Herald]] |volume=LXII |issue=19056\n| date = 1925-06-29\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19250629.2.140.4\n| accessdate = 2019-09-12}}</ref> Auckland then played against the [[New Zealand national rugby league team|New Zealand]] team and lost 9 points to 16. Following this they played a Northern Union Challenge Cup match against the holders South Auckland and were victorious by 24 points to 16. After the New Zealand team returned from their tour of [[Australia]] they again played Auckland at [[Carlaw Park]] and they used the experience they had gained to trounce Auckland by 41 points to 17, employing tactics that the Auckland team were not prepared for. Two weeks later Auckland played [[Queensland rugby league team|Queensland]] who were being touted as the finest league team in the world at the time in the first of three matches. They drew the first, before narrowly losing the second and then being well and truly outclassed in the 3rd match by 54 points to 14.\n\n===Representative Fixtures===\nAfter the trial matches were played the New Zealand team was selected by Mr Liversedge, Pearce, and Harding, and 14 Auckland players made the side. They were: C. Dufty, P. Gregory, Lou Brown, A. Brisbane, F. Delgrosso, J. Kirwan, B. Laing, M. Wetherill, W. Wilson-Hall, C. Webb, B. Avery, E. Herring, J. O'Brien, and H. Dixon.

On 30 March [[Auckland Rugby League]] held its fifteenth annual meeting with 200 in attendance. The strong financial position of the league was commented on. It was also decided that if possible the Senior Grade would be split into A and B divisions owing to the increasing number of teams who wished to enter but also the gap in standard between the best teams and the worst.<ref>{{cite news \n| title =Most Successful Year/Sound Financial Position/The Election of Officers\n| page =12\n| work= [[The New Zealand Herald]] |volume=LXII |issue=18981 \n| date = 1925-03-31\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19250331.2.155\n| accessdate = 2019-09-11}}</ref>\n\n[[City Rovers]] won the First Grade Championship for the 7th time in just 15 seasons. [[Ponsonby Ponies|Ponsonby]] won the Roope Rooster Knockout competition for the 4th time in the 11 seasons it had been competed for. Ponsonby also won the Stormont Shield after defeating City in the final.\n\nWhile in the B division [[Ellerslie Eagles|Ellerslie]]  won the inaugural title and were awarded the Norton Cup. At the end of the season these teams competed for their own knockout trophy which was named the Stallard Cup.

Unfortunately the weather did not oblige and it was in fact described as \"the worst experienced this season ... in one place there was a miniature lake.\" This resulted in a crowd many times smaller, however thousands came into the ground to watch the main match between North Island and South Island, won by the former 27 points to 9.<ref>{{cite news \n| title =The Minor Trial Games/A Win for South Auckland/Play Marred by the Rain\n| page =12 \n| work= [[The New Zealand Herald]] |volume=LXII |issue=19056\n| date = 1925-06-29\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19250629.2.140.4\n| accessdate = 2019-09-12}}</ref> Auckland then played against the [[New Zealand national rugby league team|New Zealand]] team and lost 9 points to 16. Following this they played a Northern Union Challenge Cup match against the holders South Auckland and were victorious by 24 points to 16. After the New Zealand team returned from their tour of [[Australia]] they again played Auckland at [[Carlaw Park]] and they used the experience they had gained to trounce Auckland by 41 points to 17, employing tactics that the Auckland team were not prepared for. Two weeks later Auckland played [[Queensland rugby league team|Queensland]] who were being touted as the finest league team in the world at the time in the first of three matches. They drew the first, before narrowly losing the second and then being well and truly outclassed in the 3rd match by 54 points to 14.\n\n===Representative Fixtures===\nAfter the trial matches were played the New Zealand team was selected by Mr Liversedge, Pearce, and Harding, and 14 Auckland players made the side. They were: C. Dufty, P. Gregory, Lou Brown, A. Brisbane, F. Delgrosso, J. Kirwan, B. Laing, M. Wetherill, W. Wilson-Hall, C. Webb, B. Avery, E. Herring, J. O'Brien, and H. Dixon.

{"title_page": "Court of Audit (France)", "text_new": "[[Image:Cour des Comptes 050917 105256.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Courtroom]]\nThe '''Court of Auditors''' ({{lang-fr|Cour des comptes}}) is a [[France|French]] [[judiciary of France#Administrative|administrative court]] charged with conducting financial and legislative [[audit]]s of most public institutions and some private institutions, including the central Government, [[Government-owned corporation|national public corporations]], [[Social Security in France|social security]] agencies (since 1950), and [[public services]] (since 1976).  The Court is essentially a cross between a [[Exchequer of Pleas|court of exchequer]], comptroller general's office, and [[Comptroller and Auditor General|auditor general]]'s office in common-law countries.\n\nIt is as well a [[Grand Corps of the French State]] mainly recruiting among the best students graduating from the [[Ecole nationale d'administration]].\n\nThe Court's three duties are to conduct financial audits of accounts, conduct [[good governance]] audits, and provide information and advice to the French [[Parliament of France|Parliament]] and Administration. The Court verifies the good form of accounting and the proper handling of public money. Established in 1807, the Court is the successor to the [[Court of Auditors (France)|Paris Court of Accounts]] under the monarchy, or [[Ancien R\u00e9gime]], and had [[inherent jurisdiction]] to audit all public accounting officials and agencies. The Court of Audit is [[Independent judiciary|independent]] from the [[Legislature|legislative]] and [[Executive (government)|executive]] branches of Government. However, the 1946 and 1958 French constitutions made it the Court's duty to assist the Cabinet and Parliament in regulating government spending.\n\n==Composition==\nThe president (''premier pr\u00e9sident'') of the Court of Audit is appointed by Order-in-Council of the [[Council of Ministers of France|Cabinet]]. Once appointed, the president of the Court and division presidents have security of tenure. The Court has its own [[Public Prosecutor|Office of the Prosecutor]] - with a Chief Prosecutor, Chief Deputy Prosecutor, and two deputy prosecutors - that represents the Government before the Court. The Court is split into seven divisions, each with nearly 30 judges ordinary and deputy judges and headed by a division president. Jurisdiction is split between the seven divisions generally by subject matter, e.g., finance, health and social security, and so forth. The Court's president is Didier Migaud who took over in 2010 following the death of [[Philippe S\u00e9guin]]. Other judicial officers are generally split into three groups by rank:\n* puisne judges (''conseillers-ma\u00eetres'')\n**consider, hear, and adjudicate cases in panels\n* deputy judges (''conseillers r\u00e9f\u00e9rendaires'')\n**divided into 2 classes; handle case management\n* Auditor-[[Master (judiciary)|Masters]]<ref>These are not just public financial auditors but also court officers, what are generally known as masters, auditors (in Chancery courts), and commissioners, and in charge of case management, document handling and filing, and presiding over pre-trial or post-trial hearings in addition to auditing agencies and offices.</ref> (''auditeurs'')\n**divided into 2 classes; preside over hearings, collect evidence, audit, and report\n\nAll judicial officers are graduates from the National Administration Academy (''\u00c9cole nationale d'Administration'') or recruited from the Office of the Comptroller-General (''inspection g\u00e9n\u00e9rale des Finances'').\n\n==Jurisdiction and duties==\n===Original jurisdiction===\nThe French Court of Audit has original jurisdiction to audit and adjudicate accounts made by public, management, and government accountants. The Court also has authority to audit persons acting but not certified as a public accountant. If an account is found to be correct, then the Court issues a quietus to discharge the accountant. If, however, the account is found to be in error, then a debet order is issued against the defaulter. Either order is subject to appeal in the Court or final appeal at the French Supreme Court.\n\nAudits focus on:\n* Government accounting, budgets, and funds\n* Public corporations\n* National and public institutions, social security organizations, subsidiaries and sub-subsidiaries of public corporations\n* Government-funded organizations\n* Publicly funded organizations\n\n=== Appellate jurisdiction ===\nA decision from a lower audit court may be appealed at the main Court of Audit within two months of its being handed down. Afterwards, if the parties are still not satisfied, the Council of State will hear the case on final appeal. \n\nThe French Court of Audit puts together its auditing program entirely independently and is vested with very broad powers of review and examination. It publishes and submits an annual audit report to the French President and to Parliament. The report provides a detailed account of the government's poor, or possibly fraudulent, practices and criticizes poor governance and use of public funds. The Court also audits authorizing officers (''[[ordonnateur]]s'') and their expenditures.<ref>Alain H\u00e9raud and Andr\u00e9 Maurin, ''Institutions judiciaires'', 4th edn. (Paris: Dalloz, 2002), 82-3.</ref>\n\n==Audit procedure==\nIn addition to reporting poor practices, the Court judges the accounting of public financial and budgetary officials, collection agencies, or treasury departments, e.g., treasurers, paymasters-general, tax collectors, certified public accountants, and can [[Fine (penalty)|fine]] them for late reporting. In such cases, the Court fines public accounting officials for the exact amount of any sum of money that, due to an error on their part, they have unduly paid or failed to recover on behalf of the State. A debet (''d\u00e9bet''), from [[Latin language|Latin]] \"he owes\" and not limited in amount, is entered against a defaulting person, and the defaulter becomes the State's debtor. Public and government accountants must therefore have performance liability insurance. Often, however, the [[Minister of Finance (France)|Ministry of Finance]] alleviates a defaulter by granting an abatement of his arrears as the full amount is likely too much to ever pay out of pocket. If an account is audited and found not to be in default, then the Court issues a quietus (''arr\u00eat de quitus'' or ''arr\u00eat de d\u00e9charge'') acquitting and discharging the official and settling the account.<ref>V\u00e9ronique Le Marchand and Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Touboul, eds., ''Mini-guide de la justice'' (Toulouse, France: Milan, 2003), 48.</ref>\n\n==Regional audit courts==\n\nThe Court of Audit of France stands above and heads 27 regional inferior financial courts referred to in French as ''Chambres r\u00e9gionales des comptes'', or regional audit courts. The Court of Audit acts as the administrative head and court of appeal for the financial stream, hearing appeals from regional courts and issuing rule promulgation orders and administrative directives. Regional audit courts were established in 1982 to help unburden the main Court of Audit of its heavy caseload. Since their creation, they have original jurisdiction for most local, county, and regional accounting matters in continental France and its overseas dependencies. This means they audit accounts as well as public institutions to check for fraud, embezzlement, or misappropriation. In case of budgetary discrepancies, the Court can ask the local prefect to intervene and oversee the handling of public funds until budget problems have been corrected.<ref>Le Marchand and Touboul, op. cit., 49.</ref>\n\nEach court is divided into divisions and includes a judge-in-Charge - who is also either a puisne or deputy judge at the main Court of Audit - and two associate judges. Judges have security of tenure and some also serve as Commissioners-in-Council with prosecutorial duties under the Office of the Prosecutor at the Court of Audit of France. The regional courts focus on:\n* budgetary audits and assessment of local public institutions' budget use and management\n* audits of institutions and agencies in a given regional jurisdiction, namely:  public institutions (schools, public housing, hospitals) or groups funded or aided by local governments or public institutions (unions or trade associations)\n* efficiency evaluations of account management\nAccounts found to be in error are entered into debet and accounts in default or fictitious are referred to the local prefect.\n\nAccounts for towns of fewer than 3,500 inhabitants and receipts totalling less than 750,000 euros are automatically referred to the local county or regional treasurer. A regional audit court's ruling may be appealed in the same court or to the Court of Audit of France.<ref>H\u00e9raud and Maurin, op. cit., 84.</ref>\n\n== Some notable members or former members of the Cour des comptes ==\n\n* [[Jacques Chirac]]\n* [[Fran\u00e7ois Hollande]]\n\n{{commons|Cour des Comptes|Cour des Comptes}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==See also==\n*[[INTOSAI]]\n*[[International_Congress_of_Supreme_Audit_Institutions|INCOSAI]]\n*[[EUROSAI]]\n*[[Council of State (France)]]\n*[[European Court of Auditors]]\n*[[Court of Auditors (France)]]\n\n==External links==\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20081220042732/http://www.ccomptes.fr/fr/JF/Accueil.html Official website]\n\n{{coord|48.8669|N|2.3257|E|source:wikidata|display=title}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Court Of Audit Of France}}\n[[Category:Government of France]]\n[[Category:Grands corps de l'\u00c9tat|comptes]]\n[[Category:Cour des comptes (France)| 01]]\n[[Category:Government audit|France]]\n[[Category:Supreme audit institutions]]\n", "text_old": "[[Image:Cour des Comptes 050917 105256.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Courtroom]]\nThe  '''Court of Auditors''' (in [[French language|French]] ''Cour des comptes'') is a [[France|French]] [[Judiciary_of_France#Administrative|administrative court]] charged with conducting financial and legislative [[audit]]s of most public institutions and some private institutions, including the central Government, [[Government-owned corporation|national public corporations]], [[Social Security in France|social security]] agencies (since 1950), and [[public services]] (since 1976).

If an account is audited and found not to be in default, then the Court issues a quietus (''arr\u00eat de quitus'' or ''arr\u00eat de d\u00e9charge'') acquitting and discharging the official and settling the account.<ref>V\u00e9ronique Le Marchand and Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Touboul, eds., ''Mini-guide de la justice'' (Toulouse, France: Milan, 2003), 48.</ref>\n\n==Regional audit courts==\n\nThe Court of Audit of France stands above and heads 27 regional inferior financial courts referred to in French as ''Chambres r\u00e9gionales des comptes'', or regional audit courts. The Court of Audit acts as the administrative head and court of appeal for the financial stream, hearing appeals from regional courts and issuing rule promulgation orders and administrative directives. Regional audit courts were established in 1982 to help unburden the main Court of Audit of its heavy caseload. Since their creation, they have original jurisdiction for most local, county, and regional accounting matters in continental France and its overseas dependencies. This means they audit accounts as well as public institutions to check for fraud, embezzlement, or misappropriation. In case of budgetary discrepancies, the Court can ask the local prefect to intervene and oversee the handling of public funds until budget problems have been corrected.<ref>Le Marchand and Touboul, op. cit., 49.</ref>\n\nEach court is divided into divisions and includes a judge-in-Charge - who is also either a puisne or deputy judge at the main Court of Audit - and two associate judges. Judges have security of tenure and some also serve as Commissioners-in-Council with prosecutorial duties under the Office of the Prosecutor at the Court of Audit of France. The regional courts focus on:\n* budgetary audits and assessment of local public institutions' budget use and management\n* audits of institutions and agencies in a given regional jurisdiction, namely:  public institutions (schools, public housing, hospitals) or groups funded or aided by local governments or public institutions (unions or trade associations)\n* efficiency evaluations of account management\nAccounts found to be in error are entered into debet and accounts in default or fictitious are referred to the local prefect.\n\nAccounts for towns of fewer than 3,500 inhabitants and receipts totalling less than 750,000 euros are automatically referred to the local county or regional treasurer. A regional audit court's ruling may be appealed in the same court or to the Court of Audit of France.<ref>H\u00e9raud and Maurin, op. cit., 84.</ref>\n\n== Some notable members or former members of the Cour des comptes ==\n\n* [[Jacques Chirac]]\n* [[Fran\u00e7ois Hollande]]\n\n{{commons|Cour des Comptes|Cour des Comptes}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==See also==\n*[[INTOSAI]]\n*[[International_Congress_of_Supreme_Audit_Institutions|INCOSAI]]\n*[[EUROSAI]]\n*[[Council of State (France)]]\n*[[European Court of Auditors]]\n*[[Court of Auditors (France)]]\n\n==External links==\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20081220042732/http://www.ccomptes.fr/fr/JF/Accueil.html Official website]\n\n{{coord|48.8669|N|2.3257|E|source:wikidata|display=title}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Court Of Audit Of France}}\n[[Category:Government of France]]\n[[Category:Grands corps de l'\u00c9tat|comptes]]\n[[Category:Cour des comptes (France)| 01]]\n[[Category:Government audit|France]]\n[[Category:Supreme audit institutions]]\n", "name_user": "OwenBlacker", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200etop:Language tagging", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Court_of_Audit_(France)"}
