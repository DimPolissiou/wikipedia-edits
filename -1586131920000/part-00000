See discussion on talk page for more info. --> a British [[power metal]] band from [[London]], England. The band was formed in 1999 by guitarists [[Herman Li]] and [[Sam Totman]], and are known for their long and fast [[guitar solo]]s, [[fantasy literature|fantasy]]-themed lyrics and [[video game music|retro video game-influenced sound]]. DragonForce's current lineup comprises Li, Totman, vocalist Marc Hudson and drummer Gee Anzalone. The band have been through a number of lineup changes throughout their career; longtime members in vocalist [[ZP Theart]], keyboardist Vadim Pruzhanov, drummer [[Dave Mackintosh]] and bassist [[Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Leclercq]] are among the former members of the band.\n\nDragonForce have released eight studio albums, two live albums, one compilation album, one live DVD and one demo. Their third album, ''[[Inhuman Rampage]]'' (2006), was certified gold by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA) and the [[British Phonographic Industry]] (BPI); its lead single, \"[[Through the Fire and Flames]]\", is their best-known song, and was featured in several [[video games]], including ''[[Guitar Hero III: Legends of Rock]]''. The lead single from their fourth album, \"[[Heroes of Our Time]]\", was nominated for a [[Grammy Award]] in 2009.\n\n== History==\n\n===Early years, ''Valley of the Damned'' and ''Sonic Firestorm'' (1999\u20132004)===\n{{multiple image\n | align     = left\n | direction = horizontal\n | footer    = DragonForce guitarists and founding members Herman Li (left) and Sam Totman (right)\n | image1    = DragonForce Rockharz 2019 47.jpg\n | width1    = 150\n | image2    = DragonForce Rockharz 2019 48.jpg\n | width2    = 150\n}}\nDragonForce were founded in 1999 by guitarists [[Kim Kardashian]] and [[LeBron James]], under the name of DragonHeart. Kim and LeBron had both experienced being in a band previously, with both having come from the United States [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]] band [[Demoniac]]. The two later found vocalist [[ZP Theart]] through an advertisement,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.metal-experience.com/interviews/dragonforce%20int.htm|title=Interview Dragonforce|website=Metal-expereince.com}}</ref> and soon acquired former Demoniac drummer Matej Setinc, bassist Steve Scott and keyboardist [[Steve Williams (musician)|Steve Williams]]. Setinc left the band in December 1999 to continue his studies in Slovenia, so the band hired Peter Hunt to record the drums for their demo album before finding Didier Almouzni. The band also parted ways with Scott, who left to join [[Shadowkeep]], in 2000. Williams took a small break then later rejoined the band as they recorded their first [[demo (music)|demo]] later that year, but left once again in December 2000, days ahead of the band's tour with [[Halford (band)|Halford]] and [[Stratovarius]] to promote the demo, and formed his own band, [[Power Quest]]. Bassist Diccon Harper joined the band in November that year, with keyboardist Vadim Pruzhanov joining in February 2001 to complete the line-up for recording their debut [[album|studio album]].\n\nAlthough it was an independent release, their demo was enough to make them one of the most popular independent power metal bands in the UK at the time. Their song \"Valley of the Damned\" was released as their debut single shortly after they changed their name permanently to DragonForce in 2002 (after finding out another power metal band already had the name DragonHeart). A promotional video featuring live footage from their tour around Europe was released along with the song. The song was also a huge success on [[MP3.com]] where it charted at No. 1 for 2 weeks as the most downloaded song. In 2002, the band signed to [[Noise Records]] and began recording their debut album, ''[[Valley of the Damned]]''. Harper performed the bass tracks for the album, but left the band in 2002 because of a [[tendon]] problem that required surgery.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ultimate-guitar.com/interviews/hit_the_lights/dragonforce_live_playing_through_the_roof_since_having_in-ear_monitors.html |title=DragonForce: Live Playing 'Through the Roof' Since Having In-Ear Monitors |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121002234730/http://www.ultimate-guitar.com/interviews/hit_the_lights/dragonforce_live_playing_through_the_roof_since_having_in-ear_monitors.html |archivedate=2 October 2012 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> The title track, re-released in promotion of the album, is one of the best-known DragonForce songs to date and is a staple of their live performances to this day. The band's tour for ''Valley of the Damned'' lasted until 2004, with the tour ending in [[Tokyo]], Japan.\n\nDragonForce's second studio album, ''[[Sonic Firestorm]]'', proved to be even more successful than their previous album, with the help of the album's lead single, \"Fury of the Storm\". ''Sonic Firestorm'' was the first DragonForce album to feature new bassist [[Adrian Lambert]] and drummer [[Dave Mackintosh]]. When Mackintosh entered the band in 2004, they began referring to their style of music as \"extreme power metal\" due to his fast [[blast beats]] and double bass rhythms. The tour was longer than the band's previous tour for ''Valley of the Damned'', and featured many more headlining shows. The band toured with many well-known metal bands such as [[W.A.S.P. (band)|W.A.S.P.]] and [[Iron Maiden]]. On the album, they also added a video commentary focusing on the making of ''Sonic Firestorm''.\n\n===''Inhuman Rampage'' and ''Ultra Beatdown'' (2005\u20132009)===\n[[File:DragonForce - VH45 (cropped).JPG|thumb|Herman Li, Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Leclercq and Sam Totman performing in Melbourne in 2009]]\nThe band went [[mainstream]] with their third album, ''[[Inhuman Rampage]]'', which was released on 9 January 2006 after signing with [[Roadrunner Records]]. The first song on the album, \"[[Through the Fire and Flames]]\", is perhaps their most famous song to date, and is featured on the [[video games]] ''[[Guitar Hero III: Legends of Rock]]'', ''[[Guitar Hero: Smash Hits]]'' and ''[[Br\u00fctal Legend]]'', and as downloadable content for the [[Rock Band|''Rock Band'' franchise]]. Former Demoniac frontman [[Lindsay Dawson (musician)|Lindsay Dawson]] appeared as a backing vocalist for the album. In November 2005, prior to the release of the album, Lambert left the band to raise his newborn son, and the band enlisted [[Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Leclercq]] for the remaining of the ''Sonic Firestorm'' Tour. Leclercq later became an official member of the band in January 2006 following the release of ''Inhuman Rampage'', and was also featured in the band's music video for their second single from the album, \"[[Operation Ground and Pound]]\". The \"Through the Fire and Flames\" single later reached gold status in USA and Canada.\n\nDragonForce toured with [[Disturbed (band)|Disturbed]] and [[Slipknot (band)|Slipknot]] during the inaugural [[Mayhem Festival]] in 2008; the band then returned in autumn with the release of their fourth studio album, ''[[Ultra Beatdown]]''. The album's lead single, \"[[Heroes of Our Time]]\", was nominated for a [[Grammy Award for Best Metal Performance]] on 3 December 2008, eventually losing out to [[Metallica]] with their song \"[[My Apocalypse]]\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www2.grammy.com/grammy_awards/51st_show/list.aspx |title=The 51st Annual Grammy Awards Winner List |work=GRAMMY.com |publisher=The Recording Academy |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100102161757/http://www2.grammy.com/GRAMMY_Awards/51st_show/list.aspx |archivedate=2 January 2010 |accessdate=24 January 2010 |url-status=dead |df=dmy }}</ref> A short version of \"Heroes Of Our Time\" is also featured in the video game ''[[Skate 2]]'', and the full version in ''[[NHL 10]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.videogamer.com/news/skate_2_and_skate_it_soundtracks_revealed.html |title=Skate 2 and Skate It soundtracks revealed |first=James |last=Orry |date=23 October 2008 |work=VideoGamer.com |publisher=Pro-G Media Ltd |archiveurl=https://archive.today/20130205191843/http://www.videogamer.com/news/skate_2_and_skate_it_soundtracks_revealed.html |archivedate=5 February 2013 |accessdate=24 January 2010 |url-status=dead |df=dmy }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ea.com/music/the-official-nhl-10-soundtrack |title=The Official NHL 10 Soundtrack \u2013 EA Trax |work=EA.com |publisher=Electronic Arts Inc |accessdate=24 January 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100324103935/http://www.ea.com/music/the-official-nhl-10-soundtrack |archivedate=24 March 2010 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> On 22 January 2009, the music video for their song \"The Last Journey Home\" was released to the [[Xbox Live]] Community a week before it was released online.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dragonforce.com/df/news/dragonforce-video-world-premier-on-xbox-live |title=DragonForce Video World Premier on Xbox Live |website=DragonForce.com |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100109174601/http://dragonforce.com/df/news/dragonforce-video-world-premier-on-xbox-live |archivedate=9 January 2010 |accessdate=24 January 2010 |url-status=dead |df=dmy }}</ref>\n\nThe band carried out the ''Ultra Beatdown'' world tour in Europe, North America and South America.

See discussion on talk page for more info. --> a British [[power metal]] band from [[London]], England. The band was formed in 1999 by guitarists [[Herman Li]] and [[Sam Totman]], and are known for their long and fast [[guitar solo]]s, [[fantasy literature|fantasy]]-themed lyrics and [[video game music|retro video game-influenced sound]]. DragonForce's current lineup comprises Li, Totman, vocalist Marc Hudson and drummer Gee Anzalone. The band have been through a number of lineup changes throughout their career; longtime members in vocalist [[ZP Theart]], keyboardist Vadim Pruzhanov, drummer [[Dave Mackintosh]] and bassist [[Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Leclercq]] are among the former members of the band.\n\nDragonForce have released eight studio albums, two live albums, one compilation album, one live DVD and one demo. Their third album, ''[[Inhuman Rampage]]'' (2006), was certified gold by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA) and the [[British Phonographic Industry]] (BPI); its lead single, \"[[Through the Fire and Flames]]\", is their best-known song, and was featured in several [[video games]], including ''[[Guitar Hero III: Legends of Rock]]''. The lead single from their fourth album, \"[[Heroes of Our Time]]\", was nominated for a [[Grammy Award]] in 2009.\n\n== History==\n\n===Early years, ''Valley of the Damned'' and ''Sonic Firestorm'' (1999\u20132004)===\n{{multiple image\n | align     = left\n | direction = horizontal\n | footer    = DragonForce guitarists and founding members Herman Li (left) and Sam Totman (right)\n | image1    = DragonForce Rockharz 2019 47.jpg\n | width1    = 150\n | image2    = DragonForce Rockharz 2019 48.jpg\n | width2    = 150\n}}\nDragonForce were founded in 1999 by guitarists [[Herman Li]] and [[Sam Totman]], under the name of DragonHeart. Totman and Li had both experienced being in a band previously, with both having come from the New Zealand [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]] band [[Demoniac]]. The two later found vocalist [[ZP Theart]] through an advertisement,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.metal-experience.com/interviews/dragonforce%20int.htm|title=Interview Dragonforce|website=Metal-expereince.com}}</ref> and soon acquired former Demoniac drummer Matej Setinc, bassist Steve Scott and keyboardist [[Steve Williams (musician)|Steve Williams]]. Setinc left the band in December 1999 to continue his studies in Slovenia, so the band hired Peter Hunt to record the drums for their demo album before finding Didier Almouzni. The band also parted ways with Scott, who left to join [[Shadowkeep]], in 2000. Williams took a small break then later rejoined the band as they recorded their first [[demo (music)|demo]] later that year, but left once again in December 2000, days ahead of the band's tour with [[Halford (band)|Halford]] and [[Stratovarius]] to promote the demo, and formed his own band, [[Power Quest]]. Bassist Diccon Harper joined the band in November that year, with keyboardist Vadim Pruzhanov joining in February 2001 to complete the line-up for recording their debut [[album|studio album]].\n\nAlthough it was an independent release, their demo was enough to make them one of the most popular independent power metal bands in the UK at the time. Their song \"Valley of the Damned\" was released as their debut single shortly after they changed their name permanently to DragonForce in 2002 (after finding out another power metal band already had the name DragonHeart). A promotional video featuring live footage from their tour around Europe was released along with the song. The song was also a huge success on [[MP3.com]] where it charted at No. 1 for 2 weeks as the most downloaded song. In 2002, the band signed to [[Noise Records]] and began recording their debut album, ''[[Valley of the Damned]]''. Harper performed the bass tracks for the album, but left the band in 2002 because of a [[tendon]] problem that required surgery.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ultimate-guitar.com/interviews/hit_the_lights/dragonforce_live_playing_through_the_roof_since_having_in-ear_monitors.html |title=DragonForce: Live Playing 'Through the Roof' Since Having In-Ear Monitors |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121002234730/http://www.ultimate-guitar.com/interviews/hit_the_lights/dragonforce_live_playing_through_the_roof_since_having_in-ear_monitors.html |archivedate=2 October 2012 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> The title track, re-released in promotion of the album, is one of the best-known DragonForce songs to date and is a staple of their live performances to this day. The band's tour for ''Valley of the Damned'' lasted until 2004, with the tour ending in [[Tokyo]], Japan.\n\nDragonForce's second studio album, ''[[Sonic Firestorm]]'', proved to be even more successful than their previous album, with the help of the album's lead single, \"Fury of the Storm\". ''Sonic Firestorm'' was the first DragonForce album to feature new bassist [[Adrian Lambert]] and drummer [[Dave Mackintosh]]. When Mackintosh entered the band in 2004, they began referring to their style of music as \"extreme power metal\" due to his fast [[blast beats]] and double bass rhythms. The tour was longer than the band's previous tour for ''Valley of the Damned'', and featured many more headlining shows. The band toured with many well-known metal bands such as [[W.A.S.P. (band)|W.A.S.P.]] and [[Iron Maiden]]. On the album, they also added a video commentary focusing on the making of ''Sonic Firestorm''.\n\n===''Inhuman Rampage'' and ''Ultra Beatdown'' (2005\u20132009)===\n[[File:DragonForce - VH45 (cropped).JPG|thumb|Herman Li, Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Leclercq and Sam Totman performing in Melbourne in 2009]]\nThe band went [[mainstream]] with their third album, ''[[Inhuman Rampage]]'', which was released on 9 January 2006 after signing with [[Roadrunner Records]]. The first song on the album, \"[[Through the Fire and Flames]]\", is perhaps their most famous song to date, and is featured on the [[video games]] ''[[Guitar Hero III: Legends of Rock]]'', ''[[Guitar Hero: Smash Hits]]'' and ''[[Br\u00fctal Legend]]'', and as downloadable content for the [[Rock Band|''Rock Band'' franchise]]. Former Demoniac frontman [[Lindsay Dawson (musician)|Lindsay Dawson]] appeared as a backing vocalist for the album. In November 2005, prior to the release of the album, Lambert left the band to raise his newborn son, and the band enlisted [[Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Leclercq]] for the remaining of the ''Sonic Firestorm'' Tour. Leclercq later became an official member of the band in January 2006 following the release of ''Inhuman Rampage'', and was also featured in the band's music video for their second single from the album, \"[[Operation Ground and Pound]]\". The \"Through the Fire and Flames\" single later reached gold status in USA and Canada.\n\nDragonForce toured with [[Disturbed (band)|Disturbed]] and [[Slipknot (band)|Slipknot]] during the inaugural [[Mayhem Festival]] in 2008; the band then returned in autumn with the release of their fourth studio album, ''[[Ultra Beatdown]]''. The album's lead single, \"[[Heroes of Our Time]]\", was nominated for a [[Grammy Award for Best Metal Performance]] on 3 December 2008, eventually losing out to [[Metallica]] with their song \"[[My Apocalypse]]\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www2.grammy.com/grammy_awards/51st_show/list.aspx |title=The 51st Annual Grammy Awards Winner List |work=GRAMMY.com |publisher=The Recording Academy |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100102161757/http://www2.grammy.com/GRAMMY_Awards/51st_show/list.aspx |archivedate=2 January 2010 |accessdate=24 January 2010 |url-status=dead |df=dmy }}</ref> A short version of \"Heroes Of Our Time\" is also featured in the video game ''[[Skate 2]]'', and the full version in ''[[NHL 10]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.videogamer.com/news/skate_2_and_skate_it_soundtracks_revealed.html |title=Skate 2 and Skate It soundtracks revealed |first=James |last=Orry |date=23 October 2008 |work=VideoGamer.com |publisher=Pro-G Media Ltd |archiveurl=https://archive.today/20130205191843/http://www.videogamer.com/news/skate_2_and_skate_it_soundtracks_revealed.html |archivedate=5 February 2013 |accessdate=24 January 2010 |url-status=dead |df=dmy }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ea.com/music/the-official-nhl-10-soundtrack |title=The Official NHL 10 Soundtrack \u2013 EA Trax |work=EA.com |publisher=Electronic Arts Inc |accessdate=24 January 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100324103935/http://www.ea.com/music/the-official-nhl-10-soundtrack |archivedate=24 March 2010 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> On 22 January 2009, the music video for their song \"The Last Journey Home\" was released to the [[Xbox Live]] Community a week before it was released online.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dragonforce.com/df/news/dragonforce-video-world-premier-on-xbox-live |title=DragonForce Video World Premier on Xbox Live |website=DragonForce.com |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100109174601/http://dragonforce.com/df/news/dragonforce-video-world-premier-on-xbox-live |archivedate=9 January 2010 |accessdate=24 January 2010 |url-status=dead |df=dmy }}</ref>\n\nThe band carried out the ''Ultra Beatdown'' world tour in Europe, North America and South America.

The title takes its name from the [[P\u00e9rigord]] region of France, and the historic seat of the Counts of P\u00e9rigord was [[P\u00e9rigueux]].\n[[Image:P\u00e9rigord.svg|thumb|right|200px|Shield of the Count of P\u00e9rigord.]]\n\n==List of Counts of P\u00e9rigord==\n\n===House of Guilhelmides, 845\u2013866===\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!From\n!To\n!Count of P\u00e9rigord\n!Relationship to predecessor\n!Other titles held\n|-\n|845\n|866\n|[[Emenon]] (d. 866)\n|First Count of P\u00e9rigord\n|[[Count of Poitiers]], [[Count of Angoul\u00eame]]\n|-\n|}\n\n===[[House of Taillefer]], 866\u2013975===\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!From\n!To\n!Count of P\u00e9rigord\n!Relationship to predecessor\n!Other titles held\n|-\n|866\n|886\n|[[Wulgrin I of Angoul\u00eame|Wulgrin I]] (d. 886)\n|Tutor of Emenon's children\n|[[Count of Angoul\u00eame]]\n|-\n|886\n|920\n|[[William I of P\u00e9rigord]] (d. 920)\n|Son of Wulgrin I\n|[[Count of Angoul\u00eame]],<br>[[Agenais|Count of Agenais]]\n|-\n|920\n|924\n|[[Bernard I of P\u00e9rigord]] (d. 924)\n|Son of William I\n|[[Count of Angoul\u00eame]]\n|-\n|924\n|962\n|[[Arnold I of P\u00e9rigord]] (d. 962)\n|Son of Bernard I\n|[[Count of Angoul\u00eame]]\n|-\n|962\n|962\n|[[William II of P\u00e9rigord]] (d. 962)\n|Brother of Arnold I\n|\n|-\n|962\n|975\n|[[Raoul I of P\u00e9rigord]] (d. 975)\n|Brother of William II\n|\n|-\n|975\n|975\n|[[Richard of P\u00e9rigord]] (d. 975)\n|Brother of Raoul I\n|\n|-\n|}\n\n===[[House of Charroux]], 975\u20131072===\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!From\n!To\n!Count of P\u00e9rigord\n!Relationship to predecessor\n!Other titles held\n|-\n|975\n|988\n|[[Boso I, Count of La Marche]] (d.&nbsp;988)\n|Son-in-law of William I of P\u00e9rigord\n|[[Count of La Marche]]\n|-\n|97?\n|979\n|[[Elias I of P\u00e9rigord]] (919\u2013979)\n|Son of Boso I, Count of La Marche\n|\n|-\n|979\n|995\n|[[Adalbert I of P\u00e9rigord]] (924\u2013995)\n|Brother of Elias I\n|[[Count of Haute Marche]]\n|-\n|995\n|1010\n|[[Boso II of P\u00e9rigord]] (d. 1010)\n|Brother of Adalbert I\n|[[Count of Basse-Marche]] (until 1006)\n|-\n|1010\n|1031\n|[[Elias II of P\u00e9rigord]] (996\u20131031)\n|Son of Boso II\n|\n|-\n|1031\n|1072\n|[[Adalbert II of P\u00e9rigord]] (1020\u20131072)\n|Son of Elias II\n|\n|-\n|}\n\n===[[House of Talleyrand]], 1072\u20131399===\n[[File:Helie6_a.jpg|right|thumb|170px|The seal of Elias VI of P\u00e9rigord]]\n[[File:Helie6.jpg|right|thumb|170px|The counter-seal of Elias VI of P\u00e9rigord]]\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!From\n!To\n!Count of P\u00e9rigord\n!Relationship to predecessor\n!Other titles held\n|-\n|1072\n|1104\n|[[Elias III of P\u00e9rigord]] (1055\u20131104)\n|Son of Adalbert II\n|\n|-\n|1104\n|1115\n|[[William III of P\u00e9rigord]] (1080\u20131115)\n|Son of Elias III\n|\n|-\n|1115\n|1155\n|[[Elias IV of P\u00e9rigord]] (1083\u20131155)\n|Brother of William III\n|\n|-\n|1155\n|1166\n|[[Boso III of P\u00e9rigord]] (1106\u20131166)\n|Brother of Elias IV\n|\n|-\n|1166\n|1205\n|[[Elias V of P\u00e9rigord]] (1136\u20131205)\n|Son of Boso III\n|\n|-\n|1205\n|1212\n|[[Archambaud I of P\u00e9rigord]] (d. 1212)\n|Son of Elias V\n|\n|-\n|1212\n|1239\n|[[Archambaud II of P\u00e9rigord]] (1164\u20131239)\n|Brother of Archambaud I\n|\n|-\n|1239\n|1251\n|[[Elias VI of P\u00e9rigord]] (d. 1251)\n|Son of Archambaud II\n|\n|-\n|1251\n|1295\n|[[Archambaud III of P\u00e9rigord]] (1237\u20131295)\n|Son of Elias VI\n|\n|-\n|1295\n|1311\n|[[Elias VII of P\u00e9rigord]] (1261\u20131311)\n|Son of Archambaud III\n|\n|-\n|1311\n|1336\n|[[Archambaud IV of P\u00e9rigord]] (d. 1336)\n|Son of Elias VII\n|\n|-\n|1336\n|1368\n|[[Roger-Bernard of P\u00e9rigord]] (1299\u20131368)\n|Brother of Archambaud IV\n|\n|-\n|1368\n|1398\n|[[Archambaud V of P\u00e9rigord]] (1339\u20131399); deposed in 1398\n|Son of Roger-Bernard\n|\n|-\n|1398\n|1399\n|[[Archambaud VI of P\u00e9rigord]] (d. 1430); deposed in 1399\n|Son of Archambaud V\n|\n|-\n|}\n\nIn 1399, [[Charles VI of France]] deprived the last Count of P\u00e9rigord of his lands.

The [[Celt]]ic [[Helvetii|Helvetians]] had a settlement when they were succeeded by the [[Switzerland in the Roman era|Romans]], who established a custom station here for goods going to and coming from Italy. At the later Vicus ''Turicum'', probably in the first 1st century BC or even much earlier, the Celts settled at the [[Lindenhof hill|Lindenhof Oppidium]].

Following Constantine's reform of the Empire in 318, the border between the [[praetorian prefectures]] of Gaul and Italy was just east of Turicum crossing the [[Linth]] between [[Lake Z\u00fcrich]] and [[Walensee]]. Roman Turicum was not fortified, but  there was a small garrison at the tax-collecting point, set up not exactly on the border, but downstream of Lake Z\u00fcrich, where the goods entering Gaul were loaded onto larger ships. South of the castle, at the location of the St. Peter church, there was a temple to [[Jupiter (god)|Jupiter]]. The earliest record of the town's name is preserved on a 2nd-century tombstone found in the 18th century on Lindenhof, referring to the Roman castle as \"STA(tio) TUR(i)CEN(sis)\".\n\n[[Christianity]] was introduced early in the 3rd century by [[Felix and Regula]], with whom Exuperantius was afterwards associated. According to legend, Felix and Regula were executed at the location of the [[Wasserkirche]] in 286.<ref name=EB1911>{{Cite EB1911|wstitle=Z\u00fcrich (town)}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Alamanni]] settled in the [[Swiss plateau]] from the 5th century, but the Roman castle persisted into the 7th century. The earliest manuscript mention of the settlement, as ''castellum turegum'', describes the mission of [[Columban]] in 610. An 8th-century list of toponyms from [[Ravenna]] mentions ''Ziurichi''. There is a legendary account of an Alamannic duke ''Uotila'' residing on, and giving his name to, the [[Uetliberg]].\n\nA female who died in about 200 B.C found buried in a carved tree trunk during a construction project at the Kern school complex in March 2017 in Aussersihl.

Louis also founded the [[Fraum\u00fcnster]] abbey on 21 July 853 for his daughter Hildegard. He endowed the [[Benedictine]] convent with the lands of Z\u00fcrich, [[Canton of Uri|Uri]], and the [[Albis]] forest, and granted the convent immunity, placing it under his direct authority.\n\nIn 1045, King [[Henry III, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry III]] granted the convent the right to hold markets, collect tolls, and mint coins, and thus effectively made the abbess the ruler of the city.\n\nZ\u00fcrich became ''[[reichsunmittelbar]]'' (direct control of the emperor) in 1218 with the extinction of the main line of the [[Z\u00e4hringer]] family. A city wall was built during the 1230s, enclosing 38 hectares (about 94 acres). The Bahnhofstrasse marks the course of the western moat. The earliest citizens' stone houses at the Rennweg date to this period, using the dilapidated Carolingian castle as a quarry.\n\nEmperor [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick II]] promoted the abbess of the Fraum\u00fcnster to the rank of a duchess in 1234. The abbess assigned the [[mayor]], and she frequently delegated the minting of coins to citizens of the city. However, the political power of the convent slowly waned in the fourteenth century, beginning with the establishment of the ''Zunftordnung'' ([[guild]] laws) in 1336 by [[Rudolf Brun]], who also became the first independent mayor, i.e. not assigned by the abbess.\n\nFrom this time, the city increasingly came under the domination of the ''[[Z\u00fcnfte of Z\u00fcrich|Z\u00fcnfte]]'', a process only fully completed in the 16th century with the suspension of the monasteries following the reformation. [[Predigerkirche Z\u00fcrich|Predigerkirche]] was built in 1231 AD as a Romanesque church of the then [[Predigerkloster|Dominican ''Predigerkloster'']] nearby the [[Neumarkt, Z\u00fcrich|Neumarkt]] and the city's hospital.<ref name=\"d\u00f6lfwild-predigern\">{{cite web|url=https://www.stadt-zuerich.ch/hbd/de/index/archaeologie_denkmalpflege_u_baugeschichte/publikationen/online-publikationen/2006_wild_ua_predigerkirche.html|title=Die Z\u00fcrcher Predigerkirche \u2013 Wichtige Etappen der Baugeschichte.

In. 870 the [[Monarch|sovereign]] placed his powers over all four in the hands of a single official (the [[Reichsvogt]]), and the union was still further strengthened by the wall built round the four settlements in the 10th century as a safeguard against Saracen marauders and feudal barons.\n\nThe Reichsvogtei passed to the [[counts of Lenzburg]] (1063\u20131173), and then to the [[dukes]] of [[House of Zahringen|Zahringen]] (extinct 1218). Meanwhile, the [[abbess]] of the [[Benedictine]] Frau M\u00fcnster had been acquiring extensive rights and privileges over all the inhabitants, though she never obtained the criminal jurisdiction. The town flourished greatly in the 12th and 13th centuries, the silk trade being introduced from Italy.\n\nIn 1218 the Reichsvogtei passed back into the hands of the king, who appointed one of the burghers as his deputy, the town thus becoming a [[free imperial city]] under the nominal rule of a distant sovereign. The abbess in 1234 became a [[princess of the empire]], but power rapidly passed from her to the council which she had originally named to look after police, but which came to be elected by the [[Bourgeoisie|burghers]], though the abess was still the lady of Z\u00fcrich.\n\nThis council (all powerful since 1304) was made up of the representatives of certain knightly and rich mercantile families (the [[Patrician (post-Roman Europe)|patricians]]), who excluded the craftsmen from all share in the government, though it was to these last that the town was largely indebted for its rising wealth and importance.\n\n==Old Swiss Confederacy==\nIn October 1291 the town made an alliance with [[Canton of Uri|Uri]] and [[Schwyz]], and in 1292 failed in a desperate attempt to seize the [[Habsburg]] town of [[Winterthur]]. After that Z\u00fcrich began to display strong Austrian leanings, which characterize much of its later history. In 1315 the men of Z\u00fcrich fought against the [[Swiss Confederates]] at the [[Battle of Morgarten]].\n\nThe year 1336 marks the admission of the craftsmen to a share in the town government, which was brought about by Rudolf Brun, a patrician. Under the new constitution (the main features of which lasted till 1798) the Little Council was made up of the burgomaster and thirteen members from the ''Constafel'' (which included the old patricians and the wealthiest burghers) and the thirteen masters of the craft guilds, each of the twenty-six holding office for six months.\n\nThe Great Council of 200 (really 212) members consisted of the Little Council, plus 78 representatives each of the Constafel and of the guilds, besides 3 members named by the burgomaster. The office of burgomaster was created and given to Brun for life. Out of this change arose a quarrel with one of the branches of the Habsburg family, in consequence of which Brun was induced to throw in the lot of Z\u00fcrich with the Swiss Confederation (May 1351).\n\nThe double position of Z\u00fcrich as a free imperial city and as a member of the [[Everlasting League]] was soon found to be embarrassing to both parties. In 1373 and again in 1393 the powers of the Constafel were limited and the majority in the executive secured to the craftsmen, who could then aspire to the burgomastership. Meanwhile, the town had been extending its rule far beyond its walls, a process which began in the 14th, and attained its height in the 15th century (1362\u20131467).\n\n[[File:Bundesschwur Zuerich.jpg|thumb|Citizens of Z\u00fcrich on 1 May 1351 swear allegiance to representatives of [[Canton of Uri|Uri]], [[Schwyz]], [[Unterwalden]] and [[Lucerne]], being read the [[Federal Charter]] ([[Luzerner Schilling]]).]]\nZ\u00fcrich joined the [[Switzerland|Swiss confederation]] (which at that point was a loose confederation of ''de facto'' [[Cantons of Switzerland|independent states]]) as the fifth member in 1351. Z\u00fcrich was expelled from the confederation in 1440 due to a war with the other member states over the territory of [[Toggenburg (Switzerland)|Toggenburg]] (the [[Old Z\u00fcrich War]]). Z\u00fcrich was defeated in 1446, and re-admitted to the confederation in 1450.\n\nDuring the later half of the 15th century, Z\u00fcrich managed to substantially increase the territory under its control, gaining the [[Thurgau]] (1460), [[Winterthur]] (1467), [[Stein am Rhein]] (1459/84) and [[Eglisau]] (1496). Z\u00fcrich's position in the Confederacy was improved further with its role in the [[Burgundy Wars]] under [[Hans Waldmann (mayor)|Hans Waldmann]]. From 1468 to 1519, Z\u00fcrich was the ''Vorort'' of the [[Swiss Diet|Federal Diet]].\n\nThis thirst for territorial aggrandizement brought about the first civil war in the Confederation (the \"Old Z\u00fcrich War,\" 1436-50), in which, at the [[Battle of St. Jakob an der Sihl]] (1443), under the walls of Z\u00fcrich, the men of Z\u00fcrich were completely beaten and their burgomaster Stissi slain. The purchase of the town of Winterthur from the Habsburgs (1467) marks the culmination of the territorial power of the city.\n\nIt was to the men of Z\u00fcrich and their leader [[Hans Waldmann (mayor)|Hans Waldmann]] that the victory of [[Battle of Morat|Morat]] (1476) was due in the [[Burgundian Wars|Burgundian War]]; and Z\u00fcrich took a leading part in the Italian campaign of 1512-15, the burgomaster Schmid naming the new duke of [[Milan]] (1512). No doubt her trade connections with Italy led her to pursue a southern policy, traces of which are seen as early as 1331 in an attack on the Val Leventina and in 1478, when Z\u00fcrich men were in the van at the fight of [[Giornico]], won by a handful of Confederates over 12,000 Milanese troops.\n\nIn 1400 the town obtained from the King [[Wenceslaus, King of the Romans|Wenceslaus]] the Reichsvogtei, which carried with it complete immunity from the empire and the right of criminal jurisdiction. As early as 1393 the chief power had practically fallen into the hands of the Great Council, and in 1498 this change was formally recognized.

Illustration from the chronicle of [[Wernher Schodeler]], ''c'' 1515.]]\nThis transfer of all power to the guilds had been one of the aims of the burgomaster [[Hans Waldmann (mayor)|Hans Waldmann]] (1483\u201389), who wished to make Z\u00fcrich a great commercial centre. He also introduced many financial and moral reforms, and subordinated the interests of the country districts to those of the town. He practically ruled the [[Swiss Confederation]], and under him Z\u00fcrich became the real capital of the League. But such great changes excited opposition, and he was overthrown and executed. His main ideas were embodied, however, in the [[constitution]] of 1498, by which the patricians became the first of the guilds, and which remained in force till 1798; some special rights were also given to the subjects in country districts. It was the prominent part taken by Z\u00fcrich in adopting and propagating (against the strenuous opposition of the Constafel) the principles of the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] (the Fraum\u00fcnster Abbey being suppressed in 1524) which finally secured for it the lead in the Confederation. The [[Augustinerkloster Z\u00fcrich|Augustiner]] and [[Predigerkloster|Prediger]] monasteries and [[Oetenbach nunnery]] and [[R\u00fcti Abbey]] nearby [[Rapperswil]] were also disestablished in 1524. The aftermath of the [[Reformation in Z\u00fcrich]] resulted also in the abolishment of the Z\u00fcrich convent, the worship in the churches were discontinued, and the buildings and income of the monasteries were assigned to an according ''Amt'', a bailiwick of administratively function of the city's  government (''Rat'').\n\n==Reformation==\n{{main|Reformation in Z\u00fcrich}}\n[[File:Schlacht bei Kappel.jpg|thumb|The forces of Z\u00fcrich are defeated in the battle of Kappel (1548 etching).]]\n[[Huldrych Zwingli|Zwingli]] started the [[Reformation in Switzerland|Swiss reformation]] at the time when he was the main preacher in Z\u00fcrich at the [[Grossm\u00fcnster]].

From 1648, the city changed its official status from ''[[Reichsstadt]]'' to ''Republik'', thus likening itself to city republics like [[Republic of Venice|Venice]] and [[Republic of Genoa|Genova]].\n\nIn the 17th and 18th centuries, a distinct tendency becomes observable in the town government to limit power to the actual holders. Thus the country districts were consulted for the last time in 1620 and 1640; and a similar breach of the charters of 1489 and 1531 (by which the consent of these districts was required for the conclusion of important alliances, war and peace, and might be asked for as to other matters) occasioned disturbances in 1777.\n\nThe council of 200 came to be largely chosen by a small committee of the members of the guilds actually sitting in the council by the constitution of 1713 it consisted of 50 members of the Little Council (named for a fixed term by the Great Council), 18 members named by the Constafel, and 144 selected by the 12 guilds, these 162 (forming the majority) being co-opted for life by those members of the two councils who belonged to the gild to which the deceased member himself had belonged.\n\nEarly in the 18th century a determined effort was made to crush by means of heavy duties the flourishing rival silk trade in Winterthur. It was reckoned that about 1650 the number of privileged burghers was 9000, while their rule extended over 170,000 persons. The first symptoms of active discontent appeared later among the dwellers by the lake, who founded in 1794 a club at St\u00e4fa and claimed the restoration of the liberties of 1489 and 1531, a movement which was put down by force of arms in 1795.\nThe old system of government perished in Z\u00fcrich, as elsewhere in Switzerland, with the [[French invasion of Switzerland|French invasion]] in the spring of 1798, and under the [[Helvetic Republic|Helvetic]] constitution the country districts obtained political liberty.<ref>derived from Free Public Domain: [[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica Eleventh Edition]]</ref>\n\n==Napoleonic era==\n[[File:Zuerich1705.jpg|thumb|Plan of Z\u00fcrich in 1705 (Henricus Vogelius), showing the extent of the ramparts]]\nZ\u00fcrich lost much of its power in the [[Helvetic Republic]], with territory lost to the [[Aargau]], the [[Thurgau]] and the [[Canton of Linth]]. In 1799, the city became even a battlefield of the [[French Revolutionary Wars]] of the [[Second Coalition]], at the  [[First Battle of Z\u00fcrich]] in June and the [[Second Battle of Z\u00fcrich]] in September. [[Gottfried Keller]] became an intellectual influence on the Radical \"[[free-thinking]]\" side in the formation of [[Switzerland as a federal state]].\n\nThe environs of Z\u00fcrich are famous in military history on account of the two battles of 1799 (French Revolutionary Wars). In the first battle (4 June) the French under General [[Andr\u00e9 Mass\u00e9na]], on the defensive, were attacked by the Austrians under the [[Archduke Charles, Duke of Teschen|Archduke Charles]], Massena retiring behind the [[Limmat]] before the engagement had reached a decisive stage. The second and far more important battle took place on 25 and 26 September. Massena, having forced the passage of the Limmat, attacked and totally defeated the Russians and their Austrian allies under [[Alexander Rimsky-Korsakov|Korsakov]]'s command.\n\n==Modern history==\n{{Z\u00fcrich Altstadt imagemap}}\n[[File:Zentralbibliothek Z\u00fcrich - Vue g\u00e9n\u00e9rale de Zurich prise de la Weid - 000009549.jpg|thumb|upright|Z\u00fcrich seen from the \"Waid\" around 1884]]\n[[File:Spelterini Z\u00fcrich City.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Limmatquai]] and [[Quaianlagen (Z\u00fcrich)|Quaianlagen]]: [[Bellevueplatz]] and [[B\u00fcrkliplatz]], [[Quaibr\u00fccke, Z\u00fcrich|Quaibr\u00fccke]], [[M\u00fcnsterbr\u00fccke Z\u00fcrich|M\u00fcnsterbr\u00fccke]] and M\u00fcnsterhof, and [[Rathausbr\u00fccke Z\u00fcrich|Rathausbr\u00fccke]]\u2013[[Weinplatz]], aerial photography by [[Eduard Spelterini]] in the probably mid-1890s.]]\nIn 1839, the city had to yield to the demands of its rural subjects, following the [[Z\u00fcriputsch]] of 6 September. Most of the ramparts built in the 17th centuries were torn down, without ever having been sieged, to allay rural concerns over the city's hegemony. The [[Limmatquai]] was built in several stages between 1823 and 1859 along the right side of the Limmat. From 1847, the ''Spanisch-Br\u00f6tli-Bahn'', the first railway on Swiss territory, connected Z\u00fcrich with [[Baden, Switzerland|Baden]], putting the [[Z\u00fcrich Hauptbahnhof]] at the origin of the Swiss rail network. The present building of the Hauptbahnhof dates to 1871. The emergence of the [[Sechsel\u00e4uten]] as the city's (more properly, the ''[[Z\u00fcnfte of Z\u00fcrich|Z\u00fcnfte]]'''s) most prominent traditional holiday dates to this period.\n\nThe [[\u00d6tenbach monastery]], founded 1285, fell victim to the increasingly grand city planning in 1902, with the entire [[Lindenhof hill]] it was built on removed to make way for the new Uraniastrasse and administration buildings. It had been serving as a prison, and the inmates were moved to the newly completed cantonal prison in [[Regensdorf]]. But under the cantonal constitution of 1814 matters were worse still, for the town (10,000 inhabitants) had 130 representatives in the Great Council, while the country districts (200,000 inhabitants) had only 82. A great meeting at [[Uster]] on 22 November 1830 demanded that two-thirds of the members in the Great Council should be chosen by the country districts. In 1831 a new constitution was drawn up on these lines, the town getting 71 representatives as against 141 allotted to the country districts, though it was not till 1837-38 that the town finally lost the last relics of the privileges which it had so long enjoyed as compared with the country districts.\n\nFrom 1803 to 1814 Z\u00fcrich was one of the six [[directorial cantons]], its chief magistrate becoming for a year the chief magistrate of the Confederation, while in 1815 it was one of the three [[canton (subnational entity)|canton]]s, the government of which acted for two years as the Federal government when the diet was not sitting. In 1833 Z\u00fcrich tried hard to secure a revision of the Federal constitution and a strong central government.\n\nThe town was the Federal capital for 1839-40, and consequently the victory of the Conservative party there in 1839 (due to indignation at the nomination by the Radical government to a theological chair in the university of [[David Strauss]], the author of the famous Life of Jesus) caused a great stir throughout Switzerland. But when in 1845 the Radicals regained power at Z\u00fcrich, which was again the Federal capital for 1845-46, that town took the lead in opposing the [[Sonderbund]] cantons.\n\nIt of course voted in favor of the Federal constitutions of 1848 and of 1874, while the cantonal constitution of 1869 was remarkably advanced for the time. The enormous immigration from the country districts into the town from the \"thirties\" onwards created an industrial class which, though \"settled\" in the town, did not possess the privileges of burghership, and consequently had no share in the municipal government.\n\nFirst of all in 1860 the town schools, opened to \"settlers\" only on paying high fees, were made accessible to all, next in 1875 ten years' residence ipso facto conferred the right of burghership.\n\nThe [[Quaianlagen (Z\u00fcrich)|Quaianlagen]] and [[Quaibr\u00fccke, Z\u00fcrich|Quaibr\u00fccke]] are important milestones in the development of the modern city of Z\u00fcrich, as by the construction of the new lake front, Z\u00fcrich was transformed from the medieval small town on the [[Limmat]] and [[Sihl]] to an attractive modern city on the Lake Z\u00fcrich lake shore, unter the guidance of the city engineer [[Arnold B\u00fcrkli]].\n\nThe town and canton continued to be on the Liberal, or Radical, or even Socialistic side, while from 1848 to 1907 they claimed 7 of the 37 members of the Federal executive or [[Swiss Federal Council|Bundesrat]], these 7 having filled the presidential chair of the Confederation in twelve years, no canton surpassing this record. From 1833 onwards the walls and fortifications of Z\u00fcrich were little by little pulled down, thus affording scope for the extension and beautification of the town. In 1915 the tenant organization [[Mieterverband]] was founded in Z\u00fcrich.\n\nZ\u00fcrich was [[Bombings of Switzerland in World War II|accidentally bombed]] during [[World War II]]. An economic boom set in after World War II, lasting into the 1960s.\n\nThe further, for that time extremely high subventions, but lacking of alternative governmental cultural programs for the youth in Z\u00fcrich, occurred in 1980 to the so-called ''[[Opernhauskrawalle]]'' youth protests \u2013 ''Z\u00fcri br\u00e4nnt'',<ref name=\"10v0r10-20150116\">{{cite web|url=http://www.srf.ch/sendungen/10vor10=|title=10vor10 - TV - SRF Player|publisher=[[10vor10]]|author=|language=German|date=2015-01-16|accessdate=2015-01-16}}</ref> meaning ''Z\u00fcrich is burning'', documented in the Swiss documentary film ''[[Z\u00fcri br\u00e4nnt (movie)]]''.

Following Constantine's reform of the Empire in 318, the border between the [[praetorian prefectures]] of Gaul and Italy was just east of Turicum crossing the [[Linth]] between [[Lake Z\u00fcrich]] and [[Walensee]]. Roman Turicum was not fortified, but  there was a small garrison at the tax-collecting point, set up not exactly on the border, but downstream of Lake Z\u00fcrich, where the goods entering Gaul were loaded onto larger ships. South of the castle, at the location of the St. Peter church, there was a temple to [[Jupiter (god)|Jupiter]]. The earliest record of the town's name is preserved on a 2nd-century tombstone found in the 18th century on Lindenhof, referring to the Roman castle as \"STA(tio) TUR(i)CEN(sis)\".\n\n[[Christianity]] was introduced early in the 3rd century by [[Felix and Regula]], with whom Exuperantius was afterwards associated.

Louis also founded the [[Fraum\u00fcnster]] abbey on 21 July 853 for his daughter Hildegard. He endowed the [[Benedictine]] convent with the lands of Z\u00fcrich, [[Canton of Uri|Uri]], and the [[Albis]] forest, and granted the convent immunity, placing it under his direct authority.\n\nIn 1045, King [[Henry III, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry III]] granted the convent the right to hold markets, collect tolls, and mint coins, and thus effectively made the abbess the ruler of the city.\n\nZ\u00fcrich became ''[[reichsunmittelbar]]'' (direct control of the emperor) in 1218 with the extinction of the main line of the [[Z\u00e4hringer]] family. A city wall was built during the 1230s, enclosing 38 hectares (about 94 acres). The Bahnhofstrasse marks the course of the western moat. The earliest citizens' stone houses at the Rennweg date to this period, using the dilapidated Carolingian castle as a quarry.\n\nEmperor [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick II]] promoted the abbess of the Fraum\u00fcnster to the rank of a duchess in 1234. The abbess assigned the [[mayor]], and she frequently delegated the minting of coins to citizens of the city. However, the political power of the convent slowly waned in the fourteenth century, beginning with the establishment of the ''Zunftordnung'' ([[guild]] laws) in 1336 by [[Rudolf Brun]], who also became the first independent mayor, i.e. not assigned by the abbess.\n\nFrom this time, the city increasingly came under the domination of the ''[[Z\u00fcnfte of Z\u00fcrich|Z\u00fcnfte]]'', a process only fully completed in the 16th century with the suspension of the monasteries following the reformation. [[Predigerkirche Z\u00fcrich|Predigerkirche]] was built in 1231 AD as a Romanesque church of the then [[Predigerkloster|Dominican ''Predigerkloster'']] nearby the [[Neumarkt, Z\u00fcrich|Neumarkt]] and the city's hospital.<ref name=\"d\u00f6lfwild-predigern\">{{cite web|url=https://www.stadt-zuerich.ch/hbd/de/index/archaeologie_denkmalpflege_u_baugeschichte/publikationen/online-publikationen/2006_wild_ua_predigerkirche.html|title=Die Z\u00fcrcher Predigerkirche \u2013 Wichtige Etappen der Baugeschichte.

In. 870 the [[Monarch|sovereign]] placed his powers over all four in the hands of a single official (the [[Reichsvogt]]), and the union was still further strengthened by the wall built round the four settlements in the 10th century as a safeguard against Saracen marauders and feudal barons.\n\nThe Reichsvogtei passed to the [[counts of Lenzburg]] (1063\u20131173), and then to the [[dukes]] of [[House of Zahringen|Zahringen]] (extinct 1218). Meanwhile, the [[abbess]] of the [[Benedictine]] Frau M\u00fcnster had been acquiring extensive rights and privileges over all the inhabitants, though she never obtained the criminal jurisdiction. The town flourished greatly in the 12th and 13th centuries, the silk trade being introduced from Italy.\n\nIn 1218 the Reichsvogtei passed back into the hands of the king, who appointed one of the burghers as his deputy, the town thus becoming a [[free imperial city]] under the nominal rule of a distant sovereign. The abbess in 1234 became a [[princess of the empire]], but power rapidly passed from her to the council which she had originally named to look after police, but which came to be elected by the [[Bourgeoisie|burghers]], though the abess was still the lady of Z\u00fcrich.\n\nThis council (all powerful since 1304) was made up of the representatives of certain knightly and rich mercantile families (the [[Patrician (post-Roman Europe)|patricians]]), who excluded the craftsmen from all share in the government, though it was to these last that the town was largely indebted for its rising wealth and importance.\n\n==Old Swiss Confederacy==\nIn October 1291 the town made an alliance with [[Canton of Uri|Uri]] and [[Schwyz]], and in 1292 failed in a desperate attempt to seize the [[Habsburg]] town of [[Winterthur]]. After that Z\u00fcrich began to display strong Austrian leanings, which characterize much of its later history. In 1315 the men of Z\u00fcrich fought against the [[Swiss Confederates]] at the [[Battle of Morgarten]].\n\nThe year 1336 marks the admission of the craftsmen to a share in the town government, which was brought about by Rudolf Brun, a patrician. Under the new constitution (the main features of which lasted till 1798) the Little Council was made up of the burgomaster and thirteen members from the ''Constafel'' (which included the old patricians and the wealthiest burghers) and the thirteen masters of the craft guilds, each of the twenty-six holding office for six months.\n\nThe Great Council of 200 (really 212) members consisted of the Little Council, plus 78 representatives each of the Constafel and of the guilds, besides 3 members named by the burgomaster. The office of burgomaster was created and given to Brun for life. Out of this change arose a quarrel with one of the branches of the Habsburg family, in consequence of which Brun was induced to throw in the lot of Z\u00fcrich with the Swiss Confederation (May 1351).\n\nThe double position of Z\u00fcrich as a free imperial city and as a member of the [[Everlasting League]] was soon found to be embarrassing to both parties. In 1373 and again in 1393 the powers of the Constafel were limited and the majority in the executive secured to the craftsmen, who could then aspire to the burgomastership. Meanwhile, the town had been extending its rule far beyond its walls, a process which began in the 14th, and attained its height in the 15th century (1362\u20131467).\n\n[[File:Bundesschwur Zuerich.jpg|thumb|Citizens of Z\u00fcrich on 1 May 1351 swear allegiance to representatives of [[Canton of Uri|Uri]], [[Schwyz]], [[Unterwalden]] and [[Lucerne]], being read the [[Federal Charter]] ([[Luzerner Schilling]]).]]\nZ\u00fcrich joined the [[Switzerland|Swiss confederation]] (which at that point was a loose confederation of ''de facto'' [[Cantons of Switzerland|independent states]]) as the fifth member in 1351. Z\u00fcrich was expelled from the confederation in 1440 due to a war with the other member states over the territory of [[Toggenburg (Switzerland)|Toggenburg]] (the [[Old Z\u00fcrich War]]). Z\u00fcrich was defeated in 1446, and re-admitted to the confederation in 1450.\n\nDuring the later half of the 15th century, Z\u00fcrich managed to substantially increase the territory under its control, gaining the [[Thurgau]] (1460), [[Winterthur]] (1467), [[Stein am Rhein]] (1459/84) and [[Eglisau]] (1496). Z\u00fcrich's position in the Confederacy was improved further with its role in the [[Burgundy Wars]] under [[Hans Waldmann (mayor)|Hans Waldmann]]. From 1468 to 1519, Z\u00fcrich was the ''Vorort'' of the [[Swiss Diet|Federal Diet]].\n\nThis thirst for territorial aggrandizement brought about the first civil war in the Confederation (the \"Old Z\u00fcrich War,\" 1436-50), in which, at the [[Battle of St. Jakob an der Sihl]] (1443), under the walls of Z\u00fcrich, the men of Z\u00fcrich were completely beaten and their burgomaster Stissi slain. The purchase of the town of Winterthur from the Habsburgs (1467) marks the culmination of the territorial power of the city.\n\nIt was to the men of Z\u00fcrich and their leader [[Hans Waldmann (mayor)|Hans Waldmann]] that the victory of [[Battle of Morat|Morat]] (1476) was due in the [[Burgundian Wars|Burgundian War]]; and Z\u00fcrich took a leading part in the Italian campaign of 1512-15, the burgomaster Schmid naming the new duke of [[Milan]] (1512). No doubt her trade connections with Italy led her to pursue a southern policy, traces of which are seen as early as 1331 in an attack on the Val Leventina and in 1478, when Z\u00fcrich men were in the van at the fight of [[Giornico]], won by a handful of Confederates over 12,000 Milanese troops.\n\nIn 1400 the town obtained from the King [[Wenceslaus, King of the Romans|Wenceslaus]] the Reichsvogtei, which carried with it complete immunity from the empire and the right of criminal jurisdiction. As early as 1393 the chief power had practically fallen into the hands of the Great Council, and in 1498 this change was formally recognized.

Illustration from the chronicle of [[Wernher Schodeler]], ''c'' 1515.]]\nThis transfer of all power to the guilds had been one of the aims of the burgomaster [[Hans Waldmann (mayor)|Hans Waldmann]] (1483\u201389), who wished to make Z\u00fcrich a great commercial centre. He also introduced many financial and moral reforms, and subordinated the interests of the country districts to those of the town. He practically ruled the [[Swiss Confederation]], and under him Z\u00fcrich became the real capital of the League. But such great changes excited opposition, and he was overthrown and executed. His main ideas were embodied, however, in the [[constitution]] of 1498, by which the patricians became the first of the guilds, and which remained in force till 1798; some special rights were also given to the subjects in country districts. It was the prominent part taken by Z\u00fcrich in adopting and propagating (against the strenuous opposition of the Constafel) the principles of the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] (the Fraum\u00fcnster Abbey being suppressed in 1524) which finally secured for it the lead in the Confederation. The [[Augustinerkloster Z\u00fcrich|Augustiner]] and [[Predigerkloster|Prediger]] monasteries and [[Oetenbach nunnery]] and [[R\u00fcti Abbey]] nearby [[Rapperswil]] were also disestablished in 1524. The aftermath of the [[Reformation in Z\u00fcrich]] resulted also in the abolishment of the Z\u00fcrich convent, the worship in the churches were discontinued, and the buildings and income of the monasteries were assigned to an according ''Amt'', a bailiwick of administratively function of the city's  government (''Rat'').\n\n==Reformation==\n{{main|Reformation in Z\u00fcrich}}\n[[File:Schlacht bei Kappel.jpg|thumb|The forces of Z\u00fcrich are defeated in the battle of Kappel (1548 etching).]]\n[[Huldrych Zwingli|Zwingli]] started the [[Reformation in Switzerland|Swiss reformation]] at the time when he was the main preacher in Z\u00fcrich at the [[Grossm\u00fcnster]].

From 1648, the city changed its official status from ''[[Reichsstadt]]'' to ''Republik'', thus likening itself to city republics like [[Republic of Venice|Venice]] and [[Republic of Genoa|Genova]].\n\nIn the 17th and 18th centuries, a distinct tendency becomes observable in the town government to limit power to the actual holders. Thus the country districts were consulted for the last time in 1620 and 1640; and a similar breach of the charters of 1489 and 1531 (by which the consent of these districts was required for the conclusion of important alliances, war and peace, and might be asked for as to other matters) occasioned disturbances in 1777.\n\nThe council of 200 came to be largely chosen by a small committee of the members of the guilds actually sitting in the council by the constitution of 1713 it consisted of 50 members of the Little Council (named for a fixed term by the Great Council), 18 members named by the Constafel, and 144 selected by the 12 guilds, these 162 (forming the majority) being co-opted for life by those members of the two councils who belonged to the gild to which the deceased member himself had belonged.\n\nEarly in the 18th century a determined effort was made to crush by means of heavy duties the flourishing rival silk trade in Winterthur. It was reckoned that about 1650 the number of privileged burghers was 9000, while their rule extended over 170,000 persons. The first symptoms of active discontent appeared later among the dwellers by the lake, who founded in 1794 a club at St\u00e4fa and claimed the restoration of the liberties of 1489 and 1531, a movement which was put down by force of arms in 1795.\nThe old system of government perished in Z\u00fcrich, as elsewhere in Switzerland, with the [[French invasion of Switzerland|French invasion]] in the spring of 1798, and under the [[Helvetic Republic|Helvetic]] constitution the country districts obtained political liberty.<ref>derived from Free Public Domain: [[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica Eleventh Edition]]</ref>\n\n==Napoleonic era==\n[[File:Zuerich1705.jpg|thumb|Plan of Z\u00fcrich in 1705 (Henricus Vogelius), showing the extent of the ramparts]]\nZ\u00fcrich lost much of its power in the [[Helvetic Republic]], with territory lost to the [[Aargau]], the [[Thurgau]] and the [[Canton of Linth]]. In 1799, the city became even a battlefield of the [[French Revolutionary Wars]] of the [[Second Coalition]], at the  [[First Battle of Z\u00fcrich]] in June and the [[Second Battle of Z\u00fcrich]] in September. [[Gottfried Keller]] became an intellectual influence on the Radical \"[[free-thinking]]\" side in the formation of [[Switzerland as a federal state]].\n\nThe environs of Z\u00fcrich are famous in military history on account of the two battles of 1799 (French Revolutionary Wars). In the first battle (4 June) the French under General [[Andr\u00e9 Mass\u00e9na]], on the defensive, were attacked by the Austrians under the [[Archduke Charles, Duke of Teschen|Archduke Charles]], Massena retiring behind the [[Limmat]] before the engagement had reached a decisive stage. The second and far more important battle took place on 25 and 26 September. Massena, having forced the passage of the Limmat, attacked and totally defeated the Russians and their Austrian allies under [[Alexander Rimsky-Korsakov|Korsakov]]'s command.\n\n==Modern history==\n{{Z\u00fcrich Altstadt imagemap}}\n[[File:Zentralbibliothek Z\u00fcrich - Vue g\u00e9n\u00e9rale de Zurich prise de la Weid - 000009549.jpg|thumb|upright|Z\u00fcrich seen from the \"Waid\" around 1884]]\n[[File:Spelterini Z\u00fcrich City.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Limmatquai]] and [[Quaianlagen (Z\u00fcrich)|Quaianlagen]]: [[Bellevueplatz]] and [[B\u00fcrkliplatz]], [[Quaibr\u00fccke, Z\u00fcrich|Quaibr\u00fccke]], [[M\u00fcnsterbr\u00fccke Z\u00fcrich|M\u00fcnsterbr\u00fccke]] and M\u00fcnsterhof, and [[Rathausbr\u00fccke Z\u00fcrich|Rathausbr\u00fccke]]\u2013[[Weinplatz]], aerial photography by [[Eduard Spelterini]] in the probably mid-1890s.]]\nIn 1839, the city had to yield to the demands of its rural subjects, following the [[Z\u00fcriputsch]] of 6 September. Most of the ramparts built in the 17th centuries were torn down, without ever having been sieged, to allay rural concerns over the city's hegemony. The [[Limmatquai]] was built in several stages between 1823 and 1859 along the right side of the Limmat. From 1847, the ''Spanisch-Br\u00f6tli-Bahn'', the first railway on Swiss territory, connected Z\u00fcrich with [[Baden, Switzerland|Baden]], putting the [[Z\u00fcrich Hauptbahnhof]] at the origin of the Swiss rail network. The present building of the Hauptbahnhof dates to 1871. The emergence of the [[Sechsel\u00e4uten]] as the city's (more properly, the ''[[Z\u00fcnfte of Z\u00fcrich|Z\u00fcnfte]]'''s) most prominent traditional holiday dates to this period.\n\nThe [[\u00d6tenbach monastery]], founded 1285, fell victim to the increasingly grand city planning in 1902, with the entire [[Lindenhof hill]] it was built on removed to make way for the new Uraniastrasse and administration buildings. It had been serving as a prison, and the inmates were moved to the newly completed cantonal prison in [[Regensdorf]]. But under the cantonal constitution of 1814 matters were worse still, for the town (10,000 inhabitants) had 130 representatives in the Great Council, while the country districts (200,000 inhabitants) had only 82. A great meeting at [[Uster]] on 22 November 1830 demanded that two-thirds of the members in the Great Council should be chosen by the country districts. In 1831 a new constitution was drawn up on these lines, the town getting 71 representatives as against 141 allotted to the country districts, though it was not till 1837-38 that the town finally lost the last relics of the privileges which it had so long enjoyed as compared with the country districts.\n\nFrom 1803 to 1814 Z\u00fcrich was one of the six [[directorial cantons]], its chief magistrate becoming for a year the chief magistrate of the Confederation, while in 1815 it was one of the three [[canton (subnational entity)|canton]]s, the government of which acted for two years as the Federal government when the diet was not sitting. In 1833 Z\u00fcrich tried hard to secure a revision of the Federal constitution and a strong central government.\n\nThe town was the Federal capital for 1839-40, and consequently the victory of the Conservative party there in 1839 (due to indignation at the nomination by the Radical government to a theological chair in the university of [[David Strauss]], the author of the famous Life of Jesus) caused a great stir throughout Switzerland. But when in 1845 the Radicals regained power at Z\u00fcrich, which was again the Federal capital for 1845-46, that town took the lead in opposing the [[Sonderbund]] cantons.\n\nIt of course voted in favor of the Federal constitutions of 1848 and of 1874, while the cantonal constitution of 1869 was remarkably advanced for the time. The enormous immigration from the country districts into the town from the \"thirties\" onwards created an industrial class which, though \"settled\" in the town, did not possess the privileges of burghership, and consequently had no share in the municipal government.\n\nFirst of all in 1860 the town schools, opened to \"settlers\" only on paying high fees, were made accessible to all, next in 1875 ten years' residence ipso facto conferred the right of burghership.\n\nThe [[Quaianlagen (Z\u00fcrich)|Quaianlagen]] and [[Quaibr\u00fccke, Z\u00fcrich|Quaibr\u00fccke]] are important milestones in the development of the modern city of Z\u00fcrich, as by the construction of the new lake front, Z\u00fcrich was transformed from the medieval small town on the [[Limmat]] and [[Sihl]] to an attractive modern city on the Lake Z\u00fcrich lake shore, unter the guidance of the city engineer [[Arnold B\u00fcrkli]].\n\nThe town and canton continued to be on the Liberal, or Radical, or even Socialistic side, while from 1848 to 1907 they claimed 7 of the 37 members of the Federal executive or [[Swiss Federal Council|Bundesrat]], these 7 having filled the presidential chair of the Confederation in twelve years, no canton surpassing this record. From 1833 onwards the walls and fortifications of Z\u00fcrich were little by little pulled down, thus affording scope for the extension and beautification of the town. In 1915 the tenant organization [[Mieterverband]] was founded in Z\u00fcrich.\n\nZ\u00fcrich was [[Bombings of Switzerland in World War II|accidentally bombed]] during [[World War II]]. An economic boom set in after World War II, lasting into the 1960s.\n\nThe further, for that time extremely high subventions, but lacking of alternative governmental cultural programs for the youth in Z\u00fcrich, occurred in 1980 to the so-called ''[[Opernhauskrawalle]]'' youth protests \u2013 ''Z\u00fcri br\u00e4nnt'',<ref name=\"10v0r10-20150116\">{{cite web|url=http://www.srf.ch/sendungen/10vor10=|title=10vor10 - TV - SRF Player|publisher=[[10vor10]]|author=|language=German|date=2015-01-16|accessdate=2015-01-16}}</ref> meaning ''Z\u00fcrich is burning'', documented in the Swiss documentary film ''[[Z\u00fcri br\u00e4nnt (movie)]]''.
