{"title_page": "Philippicae", "text_new": "{{about|Cicero's ''Philippics''|the general concept|Philippic}}\n{{more footnotes|date=August 2018}}\n{{italic title}}\n[[File:Manuscript of Cicero - BL Kings MS 21 f. 2.jpg|thumb|Cicero's ''Philippics'', 15th-century manuscript, British Library]]\nThe '''''Philippics''''' ({{lang-la|'''Philippicae'''}}) are a series of 14 speeches composed by [[Cicero]] in 44 and 43&nbsp;BC, condemning [[Mark Antony]]. Cicero likened these speeches to those of [[Demosthenes]] against [[Philipp II of Macedon]].<ref>Cicero, Ad Atticus, 2.1.3</ref> Both Demosthenes\u2019s and Cicero's speeches became known as '[[Philippic]]'s. Cicero's Second Philippic is styled after Demosthenes' ''De Corona'' ('On the Crown').\n\nThe speeches were delivered in the aftermath of the [[assassination of Julius Caesar]], during a power struggle between Caesar's supporters and his assassins. Although Cicero was not involved in the assassination, he agreed with it and felt that Antony should also have been eliminated. In the Philippics, Cicero attempted to rally the Senate against Antony, whom he denounced as a threat to the [[Roman Republic]].\n\nThe Philippics convinced the Senate to declare Antony an [[enemy of the state]] and send an army against him. However, the commanders were killed in battle, so the Senate's army came under the control of [[Octavian]]. When Octavian, Antony and Marcus Lepidus formed the [[second triumvirate]], Antony insisted that they [[proscribe]] Cicero in revenge for the Philippics. Cicero was hunted down and killed soon after.\n\n==Political climate==\n\nCicero was taken by surprise when [[Gaius Julius Caesar]], the [[Roman dictator|dictator]] of the [[Roman Republic]], was [[Assassination of Julius Caesar|assassinated]] on the fifteenth day of March, 44 BC (known as the [[Ides of March]]) by a group of [[Senate of the Roman Republic|Roman senators]] who called themselves [[Liberatores]]. Cicero was not included in the conspiracy, even though the conspirators were sure of his sympathy. When [[Marcus Junius Brutus]], one of the killers, lifted his bloodstained dagger after the assassination, he called out Cicero's name, beseeching him to \"restore the Republic!\".<ref>Cicero, Second Philippic Against Antony</ref> A letter Cicero wrote in February 43 BC to [[Trebonius]], one of the conspirators, began, \"How I wish that you had invited me to that most glorious banquet on the Ides of March!\"<ref>Cicero, ''Ad Familiares'' [https://archive.is/20120805182037/http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Cic.+Fam.+10.28 10.28]</ref>\n\nCaesar had used his dominant position to simply appoint his supporters to [[Roman magistrate|magistracies]] (which were normally elected positions) and [[promagistrate|promagistracies]] (which were usually assigned by the [[Roman Senate|Senate]]). This was a clear violation of the [[Roman constitution]] and left Caesar's supporters, known as the Caesarian faction, vulnerable to their appointments being declared illegal by the Senate. Following the assassination, the Caesarians sought to legitimise their positions and to take revenge on the assassins.\n\nWith the Caesarians and supporters of the assassins deadlocked in the Senate, Cicero brokered a compromise. He arranged for the Senate to confirm Caesar's appointees in their posts, and in exchange issue an amnesty for the assassins. This brought an uneasy peace between the factions, though it would last less than a year.\n\nCicero became a popular leader during the subsequent months of instability. He was opposed by [[Mark Antony]], one of the [[Roman consul|consuls]] for 44&nbsp;BC and the leader of the Caesarian faction. In private, Cicero expressed his regret that the assassins had not eliminated Antony as well as Caesar. The two men had never been on friendly terms, and their relationship worsened when Antony began acting as the unofficial [[executor]] of Caesar's [[will (law)|will]]. Cicero made it clear that he felt Antony was misrepresenting Caesar's wishes and intentions for his own gain.\n\n[[Octavian]], Caesar's adopted son and heir, arrived in Italy in April, and visited Cicero at his villa before heading to Rome. Sensing an opportunity, Cicero encouraged Octavian to oppose Antony.<ref name=\"4.19\">Appian, ''Civil Wars'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Appian/Civil_Wars/4*.html#19 4.19]</ref> In September, Cicero began attacking Antony in a series of speeches, which he called the [[Philippic]]s, in honour of his inspiration, [[Demosthenes]]' speeches denouncing [[Philip II of Macedon]]. Cicero lavished praise on Octavian, calling him a \"god-sent child\", claiming that the young man desired only honour and would not make the same mistakes as Caesar had.\n\nDuring the period of the Phillippics, Cicero's popularity as a public figure was unrivalled. He was appointed [[princeps senatus]] ('first man of the Senate') in 43&nbsp;BC, becoming the first [[plebeian]] to hold the position. Cicero's attacks rallied the Senate to firmly oppose Antony, whom he called a \"sheep\". According to the historian [[Appian]], for a few months Cicero \"had the [most] power any popular leader could possibly have\".<ref name=\"4.19\"/>\n\n==Speeches==\nThe fourteen speeches were:\n* ''1st Philippic'' (speech in the Senate, 2 September 44): Cicero criticises the legislation of the [[Roman consul|consul]]s in office, [[Mark Antony]] and [[Publius Cornelius Dolabella (suffect consul 44 BC)|Publius Cornelius Dolabella]], who, he said, had acted counter to the will of the late Caesar (''acta Caesaris''). He demands that the consuls return to looking after the welfare of the Roman people.\n* ''2nd Philippic'' (pamphlet, conceived as a senatorial speech, 24 October 44,<ref>cf. Ciceros, ''Ad Atticum'' 15.13.1</ref> possibly published only after the death of Cicero): Vehement attacks on Mark Antony, including the accusation that he surpasses in his political ambition even [[Lucius Sergius Catilina]] and [[Publius Clodius Pulcher]]. Catalogue of the \"atrocities\" of Mark Antony. It is the longest of Cicero's Philippics.\n* ''3rd Philippic'' (speech in the Senate, 20 December 44, in the morning): Fearing prosecution once his term as consul ends on 1 January, Antony has left Rome with an army, heading for [[Cisalpine Gaul]]. Cicero calls on the Senate to act against Antony, and demands that they show solidarity with [[Augustus|Octavian]] and [[Decimus Junius Brutus Albinus|Decimus Junius Brutus]] (one of Caesar's assassins who was now serving as the governor of Cisalpine Gaul).\n* ''4th Philippic'' (speech in the [[Legislative Assemblies of the Roman Republic|public assembly]], 20 December 44, in the afternoon): Cicero denounces Mark Antony as a public enemy and argues that peace with Antony is inconceivable.\n* ''5th Philippic'' (speech in the Senate, held in the [[Temple of Jupiter Capitolinus]],<ref>{{cite book |last1=Cicero |first1=Marcus Tullius |authorlink1=Cicero |translator-last=Bailey |translator-first=D.

Cicero proposes that the Senate honour [[Decimus Junius Brutus Albinus|Decimus Junius Brutus]], [[Augustus|Octavian]] and his troops, and [[Marcus Aemilius Lepidus (triumvir)|Marcus Aemilius Lepidus]]. Cicero's proposals are declined; the Senate sends the three ex-consuls [[Lucius Calpurnius Piso Caesoninus (consul 58 BC)|Lucius Calpurnius Piso Caesoninus]], [[Lucius Marcius Philippus (consul 56 BC)|Lucius Marcius Philippus]] and [[Servius Sulpicius Rufus]] to Mark Antony.\n* ''6th Philippic'' (speech in the public assembly, 4 January 43): Cicero describes the embassy carried out by the Senate as merely delaying an inevitable declaration of war against Mark Antony. He believes war will come after the return of the ambassadors. He appeals for unanimity in the fight for freedom.\n* ''7th Philippic'' (speech in the Senate, outside the [[agenda (meeting)|agenda]], in mid-January 43): Cicero presents himself as an attorney of peace, but considers war against Mark Antony as a demand of the moment. Once more, he demands that negotiations with Mark Antony be discontinued.\n*''8th Philippic'' (speech in the Senate, 3 February 43): Because Antony has turned down the demands of the Senate, Cicero concludes that the political situation is a ''[[de facto]]'' war. He would rather use the word ''bellum'' (war) than ''tumultus'' (unrest) to describe the current situation. He criticises the ex-consul [[Quintus Fufius Calenus]], who wants to negotiate peace with Mark Antony: peace under him would be the same as slavery. He proposes amnesty to all soldiers that will leave Antony before 15 March 43, but those who stay with him later should be considered public enemies. The Senate agrees.\n*''9th Philippic'' (speech in the Senate, 4 February 43): Cicero demands that the Senate honour [[Servius Sulpicius Rufus]], who died during the embassy to Mark Antony. The Senate agrees to this proposal.\n*''10th Philippic'' (speech in the Senate, in mid-February 43): Cicero praises the military deeds of [[Marcus Junius Brutus]] in [[Macedonia (Roman province)|Macedonia]] and [[Illyricum (Roman province)|Illyricum]]. He demands that the Senate confirm Brutus as the [[Roman governor|governor]] of Macedonia, Illyricum, and Greece together with the troops. The Senate agrees.\n*''11th Philippic'' (speech in the Senate, end of February 43): Cicero castigates Dolabella for having murdered [[Trebonius|Gaius Trebonius]], the governor of [[Asia (Roman province)|Asia]]. He demands that the governorship of [[Syria (Roman province)|Syria]] be given to [[Gaius Cassius Longinus]]. The Senate turns down this proposal.\n*''12th Philippic'' (speech in the Senate, beginning of March 43): Cicero rejects a second embassy to Mark Antony, even though he was at first ready to participate in it. The Senate agrees.\n*''13th Philippic'' (speech in the Senate, 20 March 43): Cicero attacks Antony for conducting war in North Italy (Antony was besieging [[Decimus Brutus]] in [[Mutina]]). He comments upon a letter of Antony to \"Gaius Caesar\" ([[Augustus|Octavian]]) and [[Aulus Hirtius]]. He rejects the invitation to peace by [[Marcus Aemilius Lepidus (triumvir)|Lepidus]], referring to Antony's \"crimes\". He demands that the Senate honour [[Sextus Pompeius]].\n*''14th Philippic'' (speech in the Senate, 21 April 43, immediately after the victory{{which|date=February 2020}}<!-- Was this following news of the Battle of Forum Gallorum (14 April), or the Battle of Mutina (21 April)? --> of the allied armies of Octavian and Hirtius and Pansa over Antony): Cicero proposes a thanksgiving festival and praises the victorious commanders and their troops. He demands that Mark Antony be declared a public enemy (''hostis''). The Senate agrees to the latter proposal.\n\n===Analysis===\nThe first two speeches mark the outbreak of the enmity between Mark Antony and Cicero. It is possible that Cicero wanted to invoke the memory of his successful denunciation of the [[Second Catilinarian conspiracy|Catiline conspiracy]]; at any rate, he compares Mark Antony with his own worst political opponents, Catiline and Clodius, in a clever rhetorical manner.\n\nIn the 3rd and 4th speeches, of 20 December 44, he tried to establish a military alliance with [[Augustus|Octavian]]; the primary objective was the annihilation of Mark Antony and the restoration of the ''res publica libera'' \u2013 the free republic; to reach this goal, he favoured military means unambiguously.\n\nAs the Senate decided to send a peace delegation, in the 5, 6th, 7th, 8th and 9th speeches, he argued against the idea of an embassy and tried to mobilise the Senate and the Roman People to war.\n\nIn the 10th and 11th, he supports a military strengthening of the republicans Brutus and Cassius, but he was successful only in the case of the first one.\n\nIn the 12th, 13th and 14th, he wanted to wipe out any doubt against his own war policy. After the victory over Mark Antony, in the last speech he still warns against a too prompt eagerness for peace.\n\n==Consequence==\n\nCicero\u2019s attacks on Antony were only partially successful and were overtaken by events on the battlefield. The Senate agreed with most (but not all) of Cicero's proposals, including declaring Antony an [[enemy of the state]]. Cicero convinced the two [[consul]]s for 43&nbsp;BC, [[Aulus Hirtius]] and [[Gaius Vibius Pansa Caetronianus|Gaius Vibius Pansa]], to lead the Senate's armies (with an allied force commanded by [[Octavian]]) against Antony. However, Pansa was mortally wounded at the [[Battle of Forum Gallorum]], and Hirtius died at the [[Battle of Mutina]] a few days later. Both battles had been victories for the Senate army, but the deaths of its commanders left the force leaderless. The senior magistrate on the scene was [[Decimus Junius Brutus Albinus|Decimus Brutus]] (the [[propraetor]] of [[cisalpine Gaul]]), who the Senate attempted to appoint in command, but Octavian refused to work with him because he had been one of [[Julius Caesar]]'s assassins. Most of the troops switched their loyalty to Octavian. With Cicero and the Senate attempting to bypass him and now in command of a large army, Octavian decided to reconcile with Antony. Antony and Octavian allied with each other and [[Marcus Aemilius Lepidus (triumvir)|Marcus Aemilius Lepidus]] to form the [[second triumvirate]], in opposition to Caesar's assassins. With the triumvirate controlling almost all of the military forces, Cicero and the Senate were left defenceless.\n\nImmediately after legislating their alliance into official existence (for a five-year term with consular ''[[imperium]]''), the triumvirate began [[proscription|proscribing]] their enemies and potential rivals. Cicero was proscribed, as was his younger brother [[Quintus Tullius Cicero]] (formerly one of Caesar's [[legatus|legati]]), and all of their supporters.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} They included a tribune named Salvius, who had sided with Antony before switching his support to Cicero. Octavian reportedly argued for two days against Cicero being added to the proscription list, but the triumvirs eventually agreed to each sacrifice one close associate (Cicero being Octavian's).<ref>Plutarch, ''Cicero'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Cicero*.html#46.3 46.3&ndash;5]</ref>\n\nMost of the proscribed senators sought to flee to the East, particularly to Macedonia where two more of Caesar's assassins, [[Marcus Brutus]] and [[Gaius Cassius Longinus]], were attempting to recruit new armies. Cicero was one of the most doggedly hunted of the proscribed, but was viewed with sympathy by a large segment of the public so many refused to report that they had seen him. He was eventually caught leaving his villa in [[Formiae]] in a litter heading for the coast, from where he hoped to embark on a ship to Macedonia.<ref name=\"Haskell_1964_293\">Haskell, H.J.: ''This was Cicero'' (1964) p.293</ref> He submitted to a soldier, baring his neck to him, suffering death and beheading. Antony requested that the hands that wrote the Philippics also be removed. His head and hands were publicly displayed in the [[Roman Forum]] to discourage any who would oppose the new [[Triumvirate]] of Octavian, Mark Antony, and Lepidus.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==  Literature  ==\n* M.

Cicero likened these speeches to those of [[Demosthenes]] against [[Philipp II of Macedon]].<ref>Cicero, Ad Atticus, 2.1.3</ref> Both Demosthenes\u2019s and Cicero's speeches became known as '[[Philippic]]'s. Cicero's Second Philippic is styled after Demosthenes' ''De Corona'' ('On the Crown').\n\nThe speeches were delivered in the aftermath of the [[assassination of Julius Caesar]], during a power struggle between Caesar's supporters and his assassins. Although Cicero was not involved in the assassination, he agreed with it and felt that Antony should also have been eliminated. In the Philippics, Cicero attempted to rally the Senate against Antony, whom he denounced as a threat to the [[Roman Republic]].\n\nThe Philippics convinced the Senate to declare Antony an [[enemy of the state]] and send an army against him. However, the commanders were killed in battle, so the Senate's army came under the control of [[Octavian]]. When Octavian, Antony and Marcus Lepidus formed the [[second triumvirate]], Antony insisted that they [[proscribe]] Cicero in revenge for the Philippics. Cicero was hunted down and killed soon after.\n\n==Political climate==\n\nCicero was taken by surprise when [[Gaius Julius Caesar]], the [[Roman dictator|dictator]] of the [[Roman Republic]], was [[Assassination of Julius Caesar|assassinated]] on the fifteenth day of March, 44 BC (known as the [[Ides of March]]) by a group of [[Senate of the Roman Republic|Roman senators]] who called themselves [[Liberatores]]. Cicero was not included in the conspiracy, even though the conspirators were sure of his sympathy. When [[Marcus Junius Brutus]], one of the killers, lifted his bloodstained dagger after the assassination, he called out Cicero's name, beseeching him to \"restore the Republic!\".<ref>Cicero, Second Philippic Against Antony</ref> A letter Cicero wrote in February 43 BC to [[Trebonius]], one of the conspirators, began, \"How I wish that you had invited me to that most glorious banquet on the Ides of March!\"<ref>Cicero, ''Ad Familiares'' [https://archive.is/20120805182037/http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Cic.+Fam.+10.28 10.28]</ref>\n\nCaesar had used his dominant position to simply appoint his supporters to [[Roman magistrate|magistracies]] (which were normally elected positions) and [[promagistrate|promagistracies]] (which were usually assigned by the [[Roman Senate|Senate]]). This was a clear violation of the [[Roman constitution]] and left Caesar's supporters, known as the Caesarian faction, vulnerable to their appointments being declared illegal by the Senate. Following the assassination, the Caesarians sought to legitimise their positions and to take revenge on the assassins.\n\nWith the Caesarians and supporters of the assassins deadlocked in the Senate, Cicero brokered a compromise. He arranged for the Senate to confirm Caesar's appointees in their posts, and in exchange issue an amnesty for the assassins. This brought an uneasy peace between the factions, though it would last less than a year.\n\nCicero became a popular leader during the subsequent months of instability. He was opposed by [[Mark Antony]], one of the [[Roman consul|consuls]] for 44&nbsp;BC and the leader of the Caesarian faction. In private, Cicero expressed his regret that the assassins had not eliminated Antony as well as Caesar. The two men had never been on friendly terms, and their relationship worsened when Antony began acting as the unofficial [[executor]] of Caesar's [[will (law)|will]]. Cicero made it clear that he felt Antony was misrepresenting Caesar's wishes and intentions for his own gain.\n\n[[Octavian]], Caesar's adopted son and heir, arrived in Italy in April, and visited Cicero at his villa before heading to Rome. Sensing an opportunity, Cicero encouraged Octavian to oppose Antony.<ref name=\"4.19\">Appian, ''Civil Wars'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Appian/Civil_Wars/4*.html#19 4.19]</ref> In September, Cicero began attacking Antony in a series of speeches, which he called the [[Philippic]]s, in honour of his inspiration, [[Demosthenes]]' speeches denouncing [[Philipp II of Macedon]]. Cicero lavished praise on Octavian, calling him a \"god-sent child\", claiming that the young man desired only honour and would not make the same mistakes as Caesar had.\n\nDuring the period of the Phillippics, Cicero's popularity as a public figure was unrivalled. He was appointed [[princeps senatus]] ('first man of the Senate') in 43&nbsp;BC, becoming the first [[plebeian]] to hold the position. Cicero's attacks rallied the Senate to firmly oppose Antony, whom he called a \"sheep\". According to the historian [[Appian]], for a few months Cicero \"had the [most] power any popular leader could possibly have\".<ref name=\"4.19\"/>\n\n==Speeches==\nThe fourteen speeches were:\n* ''1st Philippic'' (speech in the Senate, 2 September 44): Cicero criticises the legislation of the [[Roman consul|consul]]s in office, [[Mark Antony]] and [[Publius Cornelius Dolabella (suffect consul 44 BC)|Publius Cornelius Dolabella]], who, he said, had acted counter to the will of the late Caesar (''acta Caesaris''). He demands that the consuls return to looking after the welfare of the Roman people.\n* ''2nd Philippic'' (pamphlet, conceived as a senatorial speech, 24 October 44,<ref>cf. Ciceros, ''Ad Atticum'' 15.13.1</ref> possibly published only after the death of Cicero): Vehement attacks on Mark Antony, including the accusation that he surpasses in his political ambition even [[Lucius Sergius Catilina]] and [[Publius Clodius Pulcher]]. Catalogue of the \"atrocities\" of Mark Antony. It is the longest of Cicero's Philippics.\n* ''3rd Philippic'' (speech in the Senate, 20 December 44, in the morning): Fearing prosecution once his term as consul ends on 1 January, Antony has left Rome with an army, heading for [[Cisalpine Gaul]]. Cicero calls on the Senate to act against Antony, and demands that they show solidarity with [[Augustus|Octavian]] and [[Decimus Junius Brutus Albinus|Decimus Junius Brutus]] (one of Caesar's assassins who was now serving as the governor of Cisalpine Gaul).\n* ''4th Philippic'' (speech in the [[Legislative Assemblies of the Roman Republic|public assembly]], 20 December 44, in the afternoon): Cicero denounces Mark Antony as a public enemy and argues that peace with Antony is inconceivable.\n* ''5th Philippic'' (speech in the Senate, held in the [[Temple of Jupiter Capitolinus]],<ref>{{cite book |last1=Cicero |first1=Marcus Tullius |authorlink1=Cicero |translator-last=Bailey |translator-first=D.

Cicero proposes that the Senate honour [[Decimus Junius Brutus Albinus|Decimus Junius Brutus]], [[Augustus|Octavian]] and his troops, and [[Marcus Aemilius Lepidus (triumvir)|Marcus Aemilius Lepidus]]. Cicero's proposals are declined; the Senate sends the three ex-consuls [[Lucius Calpurnius Piso Caesoninus (consul 58 BC)|Lucius Calpurnius Piso Caesoninus]], [[Lucius Marcius Philippus (consul 56 BC)|Lucius Marcius Philippus]] and [[Servius Sulpicius Rufus]] to Mark Antony.\n* ''6th Philippic'' (speech in the public assembly, 4 January 43): Cicero describes the embassy carried out by the Senate as merely delaying an inevitable declaration of war against Mark Antony. He believes war will come after the return of the ambassadors. He appeals for unanimity in the fight for freedom.\n* ''7th Philippic'' (speech in the Senate, outside the [[agenda (meeting)|agenda]], in mid-January 43): Cicero presents himself as an attorney of peace, but considers war against Mark Antony as a demand of the moment. Once more, he demands that negotiations with Mark Antony be discontinued.\n*''8th Philippic'' (speech in the Senate, 3 February 43): Because Antony has turned down the demands of the Senate, Cicero concludes that the political situation is a ''[[de facto]]'' war. He would rather use the word ''bellum'' (war) than ''tumultus'' (unrest) to describe the current situation. He criticises the ex-consul [[Quintus Fufius Calenus]], who wants to negotiate peace with Mark Antony: peace under him would be the same as slavery. He proposes amnesty to all soldiers that will leave Antony before 15 March 43, but those who stay with him later should be considered public enemies. The Senate agrees.\n*''9th Philippic'' (speech in the Senate, 4 February 43): Cicero demands that the Senate honour [[Servius Sulpicius Rufus]], who died during the embassy to Mark Antony. The Senate agrees to this proposal.\n*''10th Philippic'' (speech in the Senate, in mid-February 43): Cicero praises the military deeds of [[Marcus Junius Brutus]] in [[Macedonia (Roman province)|Macedonia]] and [[Illyricum (Roman province)|Illyricum]]. He demands that the Senate confirm Brutus as the [[Roman governor|governor]] of Macedonia, Illyricum, and Greece together with the troops. The Senate agrees.\n*''11th Philippic'' (speech in the Senate, end of February 43): Cicero castigates Dolabella for having murdered [[Trebonius|Gaius Trebonius]], the governor of [[Asia (Roman province)|Asia]]. He demands that the governorship of [[Syria (Roman province)|Syria]] be given to [[Gaius Cassius Longinus]]. The Senate turns down this proposal.\n*''12th Philippic'' (speech in the Senate, beginning of March 43): Cicero rejects a second embassy to Mark Antony, even though he was at first ready to participate in it. The Senate agrees.\n*''13th Philippic'' (speech in the Senate, 20 March 43): Cicero attacks Antony for conducting war in North Italy (Antony was besieging [[Decimus Brutus]] in [[Mutina]]). He comments upon a letter of Antony to \"Gaius Caesar\" ([[Augustus|Octavian]]) and [[Aulus Hirtius]]. He rejects the invitation to peace by [[Marcus Aemilius Lepidus (triumvir)|Lepidus]], referring to Antony's \"crimes\". He demands that the Senate honour [[Sextus Pompeius]].\n*''14th Philippic'' (speech in the Senate, 21 April 43, immediately after the victory{{which|date=February 2020}}<!-- Was this following news of the Battle of Forum Gallorum (14 April), or the Battle of Mutina (21 April)? --> of the allied armies of Octavian and Hirtius and Pansa over Antony): Cicero proposes a thanksgiving festival and praises the victorious commanders and their troops. He demands that Mark Antony be declared a public enemy (''hostis''). The Senate agrees to the latter proposal.\n\n===Analysis===\nThe first two speeches mark the outbreak of the enmity between Mark Antony and Cicero. It is possible that Cicero wanted to invoke the memory of his successful denunciation of the [[Second Catilinarian conspiracy|Catiline conspiracy]]; at any rate, he compares Mark Antony with his own worst political opponents, Catiline and Clodius, in a clever rhetorical manner.\n\nIn the 3rd and 4th speeches, of 20 December 44, he tried to establish a military alliance with [[Augustus|Octavian]]; the primary objective was the annihilation of Mark Antony and the restoration of the ''res publica libera'' \u2013 the free republic; to reach this goal, he favoured military means unambiguously.\n\nAs the Senate decided to send a peace delegation, in the 5, 6th, 7th, 8th and 9th speeches, he argued against the idea of an embassy and tried to mobilise the Senate and the Roman People to war.\n\nIn the 10th and 11th, he supports a military strengthening of the republicans Brutus and Cassius, but he was successful only in the case of the first one.\n\nIn the 12th, 13th and 14th, he wanted to wipe out any doubt against his own war policy. After the victory over Mark Antony, in the last speech he still warns against a too prompt eagerness for peace.\n\n==Consequence==\n\nCicero\u2019s attacks on Antony were only partially successful and were overtaken by events on the battlefield. The Senate agreed with most (but not all) of Cicero's proposals, including declaring Antony an [[enemy of the state]]. Cicero convinced the two [[consul]]s for 43&nbsp;BC, [[Aulus Hirtius]] and [[Gaius Vibius Pansa Caetronianus|Gaius Vibius Pansa]], to lead the Senate's armies (with an allied force commanded by [[Octavian]]) against Antony. However, Pansa was mortally wounded at the [[Battle of Forum Gallorum]], and Hirtius died at the [[Battle of Mutina]] a few days later. Both battles had been victories for the Senate army, but the deaths of its commanders left the force leaderless. The senior magistrate on the scene was [[Decimus Junius Brutus Albinus|Decimus Brutus]] (the [[propraetor]] of [[cisalpine Gaul]]), who the Senate attempted to appoint in command, but Octavian refused to work with him because he had been one of [[Julius Caesar]]'s assassins. Most of the troops switched their loyalty to Octavian. With Cicero and the Senate attempting to bypass him and now in command of a large army, Octavian decided to reconcile with Antony. Antony and Octavian allied with each other and [[Marcus Aemilius Lepidus (triumvir)|Marcus Aemilius Lepidus]] to form the [[second triumvirate]], in opposition to Caesar's assassins. With the triumvirate controlling almost all of the military forces, Cicero and the Senate were left defenceless.\n\nImmediately after legislating their alliance into official existence (for a five-year term with consular ''[[imperium]]''), the triumvirate began [[proscription|proscribing]] their enemies and potential rivals. Cicero was proscribed, as was his younger brother [[Quintus Tullius Cicero]] (formerly one of Caesar's [[legatus|legati]]), and all of their supporters.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} They included a tribune named Salvius, who had sided with Antony before switching his support to Cicero. Octavian reportedly argued for two days against Cicero being added to the proscription list, but the triumvirs eventually agreed to each sacrifice one close associate (Cicero being Octavian's).<ref>Plutarch, ''Cicero'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Cicero*.html#46.3 46.3&ndash;5]</ref>\n\nMost of the proscribed senators sought to flee to the East, particularly to Macedonia where two more of Caesar's assassins, [[Marcus Brutus]] and [[Gaius Cassius Longinus]], were attempting to recruit new armies. Cicero was one of the most doggedly hunted of the proscribed, but was viewed with sympathy by a large segment of the public so many refused to report that they had seen him. He was eventually caught leaving his villa in [[Formiae]] in a litter heading for the coast, from where he hoped to embark on a ship to Macedonia.<ref name=\"Haskell_1964_293\">Haskell, H.J.: ''This was Cicero'' (1964) p.293</ref> He submitted to a soldier, baring his neck to him, suffering death and beheading. Antony requested that the hands that wrote the Philippics also be removed. His head and hands were publicly displayed in the [[Roman Forum]] to discourage any who would oppose the new [[Triumvirate]] of Octavian, Mark Antony, and Lepidus.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==  Literature  ==\n* M.

He is best known today for being the official who presided over the [[Pilate's court|trial]] of [[Jesus]] and ordered his [[crucifixion of Jesus|crucifixion]]. Pilate's importance in modern Christianity is underscored by his prominent place in both the [[Apostles' Creed|Apostles]] and [[Nicene Creed]]s. Due to the Gospels' portrayal of Pilate as reluctant to execute Jesus, the [[Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria|Coptic]] and [[Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church|Ethiopian Churches]] believe that Pilate became a Christian and venerate him as a [[martyr]] and [[saint]].{{sfnm|1a1=Carter|1y=2003|1p=11|2a1=Gr\u00fcll|2y=2010|2p=167}}\n\nAlthough Pilate is the best-attested governor of Judaea, few sources on his rule have survived. He appears to have belonged to the well-attested [[Pontia gens|Pontii]] family, but nothing is known for certain about his life before he became governor of Judaea, nor of the circumstances that led to his appointment to the governorship.{{sfnm|1a1=Schwartz|1y=1992|1p=398|2a1=L\u00e9monon|2y=2007|2p=121}} A single inscription from Pilate's governorship has survived, the so-called [[Pilate stone]], as have coins that he minted. The Jewish historian [[Josephus]] and philosopher [[Philo of Alexandria]] both mention incidents of tension and violence between the Jewish population and Pilate's administration. Many of these involve Pilate acting in ways that offended the religious sensibilities of the Jews. The Christian [[Gospels]] record that Pilate ordered the crucifixion of Jesus at some point during his time in office; Josephus and the Roman historian [[Tacitus]] also appear to have recorded this information. According to Josephus, Pilate's removal from office occurred because he violently suppressed an armed [[Samaritans|Samaritan]] movement at [[Mount Gerizim]]. He was sent back to Rome by the legate of [[Roman Syria|Syria]] to answer for this before Tiberius, who, however, had died before he arrived. Nothing is known for certain about what happened to him after this. On the basis of a mention in the second-century pagan philosopher [[Celsus]] and Christian apologist [[Origen]], most modern historians believe that Pilate simply retired after his dismissal.{{sfnm|1a1=Maier|1y=1971|1p=371|2a1=Demandt|2y=2012|2pp=92\u201393}} Modern historians have differing assessments of Pilate as an effective ruler; while some believe he was a particularly brutal and ineffective governor, others argue that his long time in office means he must have been reasonably competent. According to one prominent [[post-war]] theory, Pilate was motivated by [[antisemitism]] in his treatment of the Jews, but this theory has been mostly abandoned.{{sfnm|1a1=Bond|1y=1998|1p=22|2a1=Carter|2y=2003|3p=4}}\n\nIn [[Late Antiquity]] and the [[Early Middle Ages]], Pilate became the focus of a large group of [[New Testament apocrypha]] expanding on his role in the Gospels. In many of these, particularly the earlier texts from the [[Eastern Roman Empire]], Pilate was portrayed as a positive figure. In some, he became a Christian [[martyr]]. In later, particularly Western Christian texts, he was instead portrayed as a negative figure and villain, with traditions surrounding his death by suicide featuring prominently. Pilate was also the focus of numerous medieval [[legend]]s, which invented a complete biography for him and portrayed him as villainous and cowardly. Many of these legends connected Pilate's place of birth or death to particular locations around [[Western Europe]].\n\nPilate has frequently been a subject of artistic representation. [[Medieval art]] frequently portrayed scenes of Pilate and Jesus, often in the scene where he washes his hands of guilt for Jesus's death. In the art of the [[Late Middle Ages]] and the [[Renaissance]], Pilate is often depicted as a Jew. The nineteenth century saw a renewed interest in depicting Pilate, with numerous images made. He plays an important role in medieval [[passion plays]], where he is often a more prominent character than Jesus. His characterization in these plays varies greatly, from weak-willed and coerced into crucifying Jesus to being an evil person who demands Jesus's crucifixion. Modern authors who feature Pilate prominently in their works include [[Anatole France]], [[Mikhail Bulgakov]], and [[Chingiz Aitmatov]], with a majority of modern treatments of Pilate dating to after the [[Second World War]]. Pilate has also frequently been portrayed in film.\n\n==Life==\n===Sources===\nSources on Pontius Pilate are limited, although modern scholars know more about him than about other [[Roman administration of Judaea (6\u2013135)|Roman governors of Judaea]].{{sfn|Carter|2003|p=12}} The most important sources are the ''Embassy to Gaius'' (after 41) by contemporary Jewish writer [[Philo of Alexandria]],{{sfn|Demandt|2012|p=34|ps=. \"Nach dem Tod des Caligula, unter Claudius, schrieb Philo seine 'Legatio'.\"}} the ''Jewish Wars'' (c. 74) and ''Antiquities of the Jews'' (c. 94) by the Jewish historian [[Josephus]], as well as the four canonical Christian [[Gospel]]s, [[Gospel of Mark|Mark]] (composed between 66 and 70), [[Gospel of Luke|Luke]] (composed between 85 and 90), [[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]] (composed between 85 and 90), and [[Gospel of John|John]] (composed between 90 and 110).{{sfn|Carter|2003|p=12}} [[Ignatius of Antioch]] mentions him in his epistles to the [[Epistle of Ignatius to the Trallians|Trallians]], [[Epistle of Ignatius to the Magnesians|Magnesians]], and [[Epistle of Ignatius to the Smyrnaeans|Smyrnaeans]]{{sfn|Bayes|2010|p=79}} (composed between 105 and 110).{{sfn|Trebilco|2007|p=631}} He is also briefly mentioned in ''[[Annals (Tacitus)|Annals]]'' of the Roman historian [[Tacitus]] (early 2nd century), who simply says that he put Jesus to death.{{sfn|Carter|2003|p=12}} Two additional chapters of Tacitus's ''Annals'' that might have mentioned Pilate have been lost.{{sfn|Wroe|1999|p=xii}} Besides these texts, coins minted by Pilate have survived, as well as a fragmentary short inscription that names Pilate, known as the [[Pilate Stone]], the only inscription about a Roman governor of Judaea predating the [[Roman-Jewish Wars]] to survive.{{sfn|Carter|2003|pp=12\u201313}}{{sfn|MacAdam|2001|p=75}} The written sources provide only limited information and each has its own biases, with the gospels in particular providing a theological rather than historical perspective on Pilate.{{sfn|Carter|2003|pp=12\u201319}}\n\n===Early life===\nThe sources give no indication of Pilate's life prior to his becoming governor of Judaea.{{sfn|L\u00e9monon|2007|p=121}} His [[praenomen]] (first name) is unknown;{{sfn|L\u00e9monon|2007|p=16}} his [[cognomen]] ''Pilatus'' might mean \"skilled with the javelin ({{Lang|la|[[pilum]]|italics=yes}}),\" but it could also refer to the {{Lang|la|[[Pileus (hat)|pileus]]|italics=yes}} or [[Phrygian cap]], possibly indicating that one of Pilate's ancestors was a [[freedman]].{{sfn|Demandt|2012|p=47\u201348}} If it means \"skilled with the javelin,\" it is possible that Pilate won the cognomen for himself while serving in the [[Military of ancient Rome|Roman military]];{{sfn|L\u00e9monon|2007|p=121}} it is also possible that his father acquired the cognomen through military skill.{{sfn|Wroe|1999|p=16}} In the Gospels of Mark and John, Pilate is only called by his cognomen, which Marie-Joseph Ollivier takes to mean that this was the name by which he was generally known in common speech.{{sfn|Ollivier|1896|p=252}} The name ''Pontius'' indicates that he belonged to the [[Pontia gens|Pontii family]],{{sfn|L\u00e9monon|2007|p=16}} a well-known family of [[Samnites|Samnite]] origin which produced a number of important individuals in the late [[Roman Republic|Republic]] and [[Principate|early Empire]].{{sfn|Demandt|2012|pp=46\u201347}} Like all but one other governor of Judaea, Pilate was of the [[equites|equestrian order]], a middle rank of the Roman nobility.{{sfn|Bond|1998|p=9}} As one of the attested Pontii, [[Pontius Aquila]], an assassin of [[Julius Caesar]], was a [[Tribune of the Plebs]], the family must have originally been of [[Plebs|Plebeian]] origin. They became ennobled as equestrians.{{sfn|Demandt|2012|pp=46\u201347}}\n\nPilate was likely educated, somewhat wealthy, and well-connected politically and socially.{{sfn|Carter|2003|p=15}} He was probably married, but the only extant reference to [[Pontius Pilate's wife|his wife]], in which she tells him after a disturbing dream not to interact with Jesus ({{bibleverse|Matthew|27:19|KJV}}), is generally dismissed as legendary.{{sfnm|1a1=Bond|1y=1998|1p=197|2a1=Demandt|2y=2012|2pp=76-77|3a1=L\u00e9monon|3y=2007|3p=167}} According to the ''[[Tres militiae|cursus honorum]]'' established by [[Augustus]] for office holders of equestrian rank, Pilate would have had a military command before becoming prefect of Judaea; [[Alexander Demandt]] speculates that this could have been with a legion stationed at the [[Rhine]] or [[Danube]].{{sfn|Demandt|2012|p=48}} Although it is therefore likely Pilate served in the military, it is nevertheless not certain.{{sfn|L\u00e9monon|2007|pp=121\u2013122}}\n\n===Role as governor of Judaea===\n[[File:First century Iudaea province.gif|thumb|Map of the province of Judaea during Pilate's governorship in the first century.]]\nPilate was the fifth governor of the Roman province of Judaea, during the reign of the emperor [[Tiberius]]. The post of governor of Judaea was of relatively low prestige and nothing is known of how Pilate obtained the office.{{sfn|Schwartz|1992|p=398}} Josephus states that Pilate governed for 10 years (''[[Antiquities of the Jews]]'' 18.4.2), and these are traditionally dated from 26 to 36/37, making him one of the two longest-serving governors of the province.{{sfn|Bond|1998|p=8}} As Tiberius had retired to the island of [[Capri]] in 26, scholars such as E. Stauffer have argued that Pilate may have actually been appointed by the powerful [[Praetorian Prefect]] [[Sejanus]], who was executed for treason in 31.{{sfn|Maier|1968|pp=8\u20139}} Other scholars have cast doubt on any link between Pilate and Sejanus.{{sfnm|1a1=McGing|1y=1991|1p=427|2a1=Carter|2y=2003|2p=4|3a1=Schwartz|3y=1992|3p=398}} [[Daniel R. Schwartz]] and Kenneth L\u00f6nnqvist both argue that the traditional dating of the beginning of Pilate's governorship is based on an error in Josephus; Schwartz argues that he was appointed instead in 19, while L\u00f6nnqvist argues for 17/18.{{sfn|Schwartz|1992|pp=396\u2013397}}{{sfn|L\u00f6nnqvist|2000|p=67}} This redating has not been widely accepted by other scholars.{{sfn|L\u00e9monon|2007|p=122}}\n\nPilate's title of prefect{{efn|Pilate's title as governor, as attested on the Pilate stone, is \"[[Prefect#Ancient Rome|prefect]] of Judaea\" ({{Lang|la|praefectus Iudaeae|italics=yes}}). His title is given as {{Lang|la|[[Procurator (Ancient Rome)|procurator]]|italics=yes}} in Tacitus, and with the Greek equivalent {{Transl|grc|epitropos|italics=yes}} ({{Lang|grc|\u1f10\u03c0\u03af\u03c4\u03c1\u03bf\u03c0\u03bf\u03c2|italics=no}}) in Josephus and Philo.{{sfn|Schwartz|1992|p=397}} The title prefect was later changed to \"procurator\" under the emperor [[Claudius]], explaining why later sources give Pilate this title.{{sfn|Bond|1998|pp=11\u201312}} The [[New Testament]] uses the generic Greek term {{Transl|grc|[[Hegemony|hegemon]]|italics=yes}} ({{Lang|grc|\u1f21\u03b3\u03b5\u03bc\u03ce\u03bd|italics=no}}), a term also applied to Pilate in Josephus.{{sfn|Schwartz|1992|p=397}}}} implies that his duties were primarily military;{{sfn|Bond|1998|p=11}} however, Pilate's troops were meant more as a police than a military force, and Pilate's duties extended beyond military matters.{{sfn|Schwartz|1992|p=197}} As Roman governor, he was head of the judicial system. He had the power to inflict [[capital punishment]], and was responsible for collecting tributes and taxes, and for disbursing funds, including the minting of coins.{{sfn|Schwartz|1992|p=197}} Because the Romans allowed a certain degree of local control, Pilate shared a limited amount of civil and religious power with the Jewish [[Sanhedrin]].{{sfn|L\u00e9monon|2007|p=70}}\n\nPilate was subordinate to the legate of [[Roman Syria|Syria]]; however, for the first six years in which he held office, Syria lacked a legate, something which [[Helen Bond]] believes may have presented difficulties to Pilate.{{sfn|Bond|1998|pp=5, 14\u201315}} He seems to have been free to govern the province as he wished, with intervention by the legate of Syria only coming at the end of his tenure.{{sfn|Schwartz|1992|p=398}} Like other Roman governors of Judaea, Pilate made his primary residence in [[Caesarea]], going to [[Jerusalem]] mainly for major feasts in order to maintain order.{{sfn|Bond|1998|pp=7\u20138}} He also would have toured around the province in order to hear cases and administer justice.{{sfn|Carter|2003|p=46}}\n\nAs governor, Pilate had the right to appoint the Jewish [[High Priest of Israel|High Priest]] and also officially controlled the vestiments of the High Priest in the [[Antonia Fortress]].{{sfn|L\u00e9monon|2007|pp=86\u201388}} Unlike his predecessor, [[Valerius Gratus]], Pilate retained the same high priest, [[Caiaphas]], for his entire tenure. Caiaphas would be removed following Pilate's own removal from the governorship.{{sfn|Bond|1998|p=19}} This indicates that Caiaphas and the priests of the [[Sadducees|Sadducee sect]] were reliable allies to Pilate.{{sfn|Carter|2003|p=48}} Moreover, Maier argues that Pilate could not have used the [[temple treasury]] to construct an aqueduct, as recorded by Josephus, without the cooperation of the priests.{{sfn|Maier|1971|p=364}} Similarly, Helen Bond argues that Pilate is depicted working closely with the Jewish authorities in the execution of Jesus.{{sfn|Bond|1998|p=89}} Jean-Pierre L\u00e9monon argues that official cooperation with Pilate was limited to the Sadducees, noting that the [[Pharisees]] are absent from the gospel accounts of Jesus's arrest and trial.{{sfn|L\u00e9monon|2007|p=172}}\n\nDaniel Schwartz takes the note in the [[Gospel of Luke]] ([[Luke 23]]:12) that Pilate had a difficult relationship with the Galilean Jewish king [[Herod Antipas]] as potentially historical. He also finds historical the information that their relationship mended following the execution of Jesus.{{sfn|Schwartz|1992|p=400}} Based on [[John 19]]:12, it is possible that Pilate held the title \"friend of Caesar\" ({{Lang-la|amicus Caesaris|italics=yes}}, {{Lang-grc|\u03c6\u03af\u03bb\u03bf\u03c2 \u03c4\u03bf\u1fe6 K\u03b1\u03af\u03c3\u03b1\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2|italics=no}}), a title also held by the Jewish kings [[Herod Agrippa I]] and [[Herod Agrippa II]] and by close advisors to the emperor. Both Daniel Schwartz and Alexander Demandt do not think this information especially likely.{{sfn|Schwartz|1992|p=398}}{{sfn|Demandt|2012|pp=60\u201361}}\n\n===Incidents with the Jews===\n\nVarious disturbances during Pilate's governship are recorded in the sources. In some cases, it is unclear if they may be referring to the same event,{{sfn|Schwartz|1992|p=399}} and it is difficult to establish a chronology of events for Pilate's rule.{{sfn|MacAdam|2001|p=78}} Joan Taylor argues that Pilate had a policy of promoting the [[imperial cult of ancient Rome|imperial cult]], which may have caused some of the friction with his Jewish subjects.{{sfn|Taylor|2006}} Schwartz suggests that Pilate's entire tenure was characterized by \"continued underlying tension between governor and governed, now and again breaking out in brief incidents.\"{{sfn|Schwartz|1992|p=399}}\n\nAccording to Josephus in his ''[[The Jewish War]]'' (2.9.2) and ''[[Antiquities of the Jews]]'' (18.3.1), Pilate offended the Jews by moving imperial standards with the image of Caesar into Jerusalem. This resulted in a crowd of Jews surrounding Pilate's house in Caesarea for five days. Pilate then summoned them to an [[arena]], where the Roman soldiers drew their swords. But the Jews showed so little fear of death, that Pilate relented and removed the standards.{{sfn|Bond|1998|pp=52\u201353}} Bond argues that the fact that Josephus says that Pilate brought in the standards by night, shows that he knew that the images of the emperor would be offensive.{{sfn|Bond|1998|p=57}} She dates this incident to early in Pilate's tenure as governor.{{sfn|Bond|1998|p=79}} Daniel Schwartz and Alexander Demandt both suggest that this incident is in fact identical with \"the incident with the shields\" reported in Philo's ''Embassy to Gaius'', an identification first made by the early church historian [[Eusebius]].{{sfn|Demandt|2012|pp=53\u201355}}{{sfn|Schwartz|1992|p=399}} L\u00e9monon, however, argues against this identification.{{sfn|L\u00e9monon|2007|p=206}}\n\nAccording to Philo's ''Embassy to Gaius'' (''Embassy to Gaius'' 38), Pilate offended against [[Halakha|Jewish law]] by bringing golden shields into Jerusalem, and placing them on [[Herod's Palace (Jerusalem)|Herod's Palace]]. The sons of [[Herod the Great]] petitioned him to remove the shields, but Pilate refused. Herod's sons then threatened to petition the emperor, an action which Pilate feared that would expose the crimes he had committed in office. He did not prevent their petition. Tiberius received the petition and angrily reprimanded Pilate, ordering him to remove the shields.{{sfn|Yonge|1855|pp=165\u2013166}} Helen Bond, Daniel Schwartz, and [[Warren Carter]] argue that Philo's portrayal is largely stereotyped and rhetorical, portraying Pilate with the same words as other opponents of Jewish law, while portraying Tiberius as just and supportive of Jewish law.{{sfnm|1a1=Bond|1y=1998|1pp=36\u201337|2a1=Carter|2y=2003|2pp=15\u201316|3a1=Schwartz|3y=1992|3p=399}} It is unclear why the shields offended against Jewish law: it is likely that they contained an inscription referring to Tiberius as {{lang|la|divi Augusti filius|italics=yes}} (son of divine Augustus).{{sfn|Bond|1998|p=39}}{{sfn|Demandt|2012|pp=51\u201352}} Bond dates the incident to 31, sometime after Sejanus's death in October 17.{{sfn|Bond|1998|p=46}}\n\nIn another incident recorded in both the ''Jewish Wars'' (2.9.4) and the ''Antiquities of the Jews'' (18.3.2), Josephus relates that Pilate offended the Jews by using up the [[temple treasury]] ({{lang|grc|korbanos|italics=yes}}) to pay for a new aqueduct to Jerusalem. When a mob formed while Pilate was visiting Jerusalem, Pilate ordered his troops to beat them with clubs; many perished from the blows or from being trampled by horses, and the mob was dispersed.{{sfn|Bond|1998|p=53}} The dating of the incident is unknown, but Bond argues that it must have occurred between 26 and 30 or 33 CE, based on Josephus's chronology.{{sfn|Bond|1998|p=89}}\n\nThe Gospel of Luke mentions in passing Galileans \"whose blood Pilate had mingled with their sacrifices\" ([[Luke 13]]:1). This reference has been variously interpreted as referring to one of the incidents recorded by Josephus, or to an entirely unknown incident.{{sfn|Bond|1998|pp=194\u2013195}} Bond argues that the number of Galileans killed does not seem to have been particularly high. In Bond's view, the reference to \"sacrifices\" likely means that this incident occurred at [[Passover]] at some unknown date.{{sfn|Bond|1998|pp=195\u2013196}} She argues that \"[i]t is not only possible but quite likely that Pilate's governorship contained many such brief outbreaks of trouble about which we know nothing. The insurrection in which [[Barabbas]] was caught up, if historical, may well be another example.\"{{sfn|Bond|1998|p=196}}\n\n===Trial and execution of Jesus===\n{{see also|Pilate's Court|Crucifixion of Jesus}}\n{{Gospel Jesus}}\nAt the [[Passover]] of most likely 30 or 33, Pontius Pilate condemned [[Jesus]] of Nazareth to death by [[crucifixion]] in Jerusalem.{{sfn|Bond|1998|p=201}} The main sources on the crucifixion are the four canonical Christian [[Gospel]]s, the accounts of which vary.{{sfn|Hourihane|2009|pp=22\u201323}} Helen Bond argues that\n<blockquote>the evangelists' portrayals of Pilate have been shaped to a great extent by their own particular theological and apologetic concerns. [...] Legendary or theological additions have also been made to the narrative [...] Despite extensive differences, however, there is a certain agreement amongst the evangelists regarding the basic facts, an agreement which may well go beyond literary dependency and reflect actual historical events.{{sfn|Bond|1998|pp=196\u2013167}}</blockquote>\nPilate's role in condemning Jesus to death is also attested by the Roman historian [[Tacitus on Christ|Tacitus]], who, when explaining [[Nero]]'s persecution of the Christians, explains: \"Christus, the founder of the name, had undergone the death penalty in the reign of Tiberius, by sentence of the procurator Pontius Pilate, and the pernicious [[superstition]] was checked for a moment...\" (Tacitus, ''Annals'' 15.44).{{sfn|Carter|2003|p=12}}{{sfn|Bond|1998|p=xi}} The authenticity of this passage has been disputed, and it is possible that Tacitus received this information from Christian informants.{{sfn|Ash|2018|p=194}} Josephus appears also [[Josephus on Jesus|to have mentioned Jesus]]'s execution by Pilate at the request of prominent Jews (''Antiquities of the Jews'' 18.3.3). However, the original text has been greatly altered by later [[Christian interpolation]], so that it is impossible to know what Josephus may have originally said.{{sfn|Bond|1998|p=67, 71}} Discussing the paucity of extra-biblical mentions of the crucifixion, Alexander Demandt argues that the execution of Jesus was probably not seen as a particularly important event by the Romans, as many other people were crucified at the time and forgotten.{{sfn|Demandt|2012|pp=44\u201345}}\n\nBond argues that Jesus's arrest was made with Pilate's prior knowledge and involvement, based on the presence of a 500-strong Roman cohort among the party that arrests Jesus in John 18.3.{{sfn|Bond|1998|p=197}} Demandt dismisses the notion that Pilate was involved.{{sfn|Demandt|2012|pp=70-71}} It is generally assumed, based on the unanimous testimony of the gospels, that the crime for which Jesus was brought to Pilate and executed was sedition, founded on his claim to be [[Kings of Israel and Judah|king of the Jews]].{{sfnm|1a1=Bond|1y=1998|1pp=197\u2013198|2a1=L\u00e9monon|2y=2007|2p=172|3a1=Demandt|3y=2012|3p=74}} Pilate may have judged Jesus according to the ''[[Roman litigation#Cognitio|cognitio]]'' {{lang|la|extra ordinem|italics=yes}}, a form of trial for [[capital punishment]] used in the Roman provinces and applied to [[Roman citizenship|non-Roman citizens]] that provided the prefect with greater flexibility in handling the case.{{sfn|Bond|1998|p=198}}{{sfn|L\u00e9monon|2007|pp=172\u2013173}} All four gospels also mention that Pilate had the custom of releasing one captive in honor of the [[Passover]] festival; this custom is not attested in any other source. Historians disagree on whether or not such a custom is a fictional element of the gospels, reflects historical reality, or perhaps represents a single [[amnesty]] in the year of Jesus's crucifixion.{{sfnm|1a1=Bond|1y=1998|1pp=199|2a1=L\u00e9monon|2y=2007|2pp=173\u2013176|3a1=Demandt|3y=2012|3pp=75\u201376}}\n\n[[File:Munkacsy - Christ in front of Pilate.jpg|thumb|left|''Christ before Pilate'', [[Mih\u00e1ly Munk\u00e1csy]], 1881]]\nThe Gospels' portrayal of Pilate is \"widely assumed\" to diverge greatly from that found in Josephus and Philo,{{sfn|McGing|1991|p=417}} as Pilate is portrayed as reluctant to execute Jesus and pressured to do so by the crowd and Jewish authorities. John P. Meier notes that in Josephus, by contrast, \"Pilate alone [...] is said to condemn Jesus to the cross.\"{{sfn|Meier|1990|p=95}} Some scholars believe that the Gospel accounts are completely untrustworthy: S. G. F. Brandon argued that in reality, rather than vacilating on condemning Jesus, Pilate unhesitatingly executed him as a rebel.{{sfn|McGing|1991|pp=417\u2013418}} Paul Winter explained the discrepancy between Pilate in other sources and Pilate in the gospels by arguing that Christians became more and more eager to portray Pontius Pilate as a witness to Jesus' innocence, as persecution of Christians by the Roman authorities increased.{{sfn|Winter|1974|pp=85\u201386}} [[Bart Ehrman]] argues that the earliest Gospel, Mark, shows the Jews and Pilate to be in agreement about executing Jesus (Mark 15:15), while the later gospels progressively reduce Pilate's culpability, culminating in Pilate allowing the Jews to crucify Jesus in John (John 18:16). He connects this change to increased \"anti-Judaism.\"{{sfn|Ehrman|2003|pp=20-21}} Others have tried to explain Pilate's behavior in the Gospels as motivated by a change of circumstances from that shown in Josephus and Philo, usually presupposing a connection between Pilate's caution and the death of Sejanus.{{sfn|McGing|1991|p=417}} Yet other scholars, such as Brian McGing and Bond, have argued that there is no real discrepancy between Pilate's behavior in Josephus and Philo and that in the Gospels.{{sfn|Bond|1998|p=201}}{{sfn|McGing|1991|pp=435\u2013436}} Warren Carter argues that Pilate is portrayed as skillful, competent, and manipulative of the crowd in Mark, Matthew, and John, only finding Jesus innocent and executing him under pressure in Luke.{{sfn|Carter|2003|pp=153\u2013154}}\n\n===Removal and later life===\nAccording to Josephus' ''Antiquities of the Jews'' (18.4.1-2), Pilate's removal as governor occurred after Pilate slaughtered a group of armed [[Samaritans]] at a village called Tirathana near [[Mount Gerizim]], where they hoped to find artifacts that had been buried there by [[Moses]]. Alexander Demandt suggests that the leader of this movement may have been [[Dositheos (Samaritan)|Dositheos]], a [[messiah]]-like figure among the Samaritans who was known to have been active around this time.{{sfn|Demandt|2012|p=63}} The Samaritans, claiming not to have been armed, complained to [[Lucius Vitellius the Elder]], the [[List of Roman governors of Syria|governor of Syria]] (term 35-39), who had Pilate recalled to Rome to be judged by Tiberius. Tiberius however, had died before his arrival.{{sfn|Bond|1998|p=67}} This dates the end of Pilate's governorship to 36/37. Tiberius died in [[Misenum]] on 16 March 37, in his seventy-eighth year (Tacitus, ''Annals'' [[wikisource:The Annals (Tacitus)/Book 6#50|VI.50]], [[wikisource:The Annals (Tacitus)/Book 6#51|VI.51]]).<ref>Karen Cokayne, Experiencing Old Age In Ancient Rome, p.100</ref>\n\nFollowing Tiberius's death, Pilate's hearing would have been handled by the new emperor [[Gaius Caligula]]: it is unclear whether any hearing took place, as new emperors often dismissed outstanding legal matters from previous reigns.{{sfn|Maier|1971|pp=366\u2013367}} The only sure outcome of Pilate's return to Rome is that he was not reinstated as governor of Judaea, either because the hearing went badly, or because Pilate did not wish to return.{{sfn|Maier|1971|p=367}} J. P. L\u00e9monon argues that the fact that Pilate was not reinstated by Caligula does not mean that his trial went badly, but may simply have been because after ten years in the position it was time for him to take a new posting.{{sfn|Bond|1998|pp=92\u201393}} Joan Taylor, on the other hand, argues that Pilate seems to have ended his career in disgrace, using his unflattering portrayal in Philo, written only a few years after his dismissal, as proof.{{sfn|Taylor|2006|p=577}}\n\n[[File:A remorseful Pilate prepares to kill himself.

Pinelli, early 19th century.]]\nThe church historian [[Eusebius]] ([[Church History (Eusebius)|''Church History'']] 2.6.7), writing in the early fourth century, claims that \"tradition relates that\" Pilate committed suicide after he was recalled to Rome due to the disgrace he was in.{{sfn|Maier|1971|p=369}} Eusebius dates this to 39.{{sfn|Demandt|2012|p=92}} Paul Maier notes that no other surviving records corroborate Pilate's suicide, which is meant to document God's wrath for Pilate's role in the crucifixion, and that Eusebius explicitly states that \"tradition\" is his source, \"indicating that he had trouble documenting Pilate's presumed suicide\".{{sfn|Maier|1971|p=369}} Daniel Schwartz, however, argues that Eusebius's claims \"should not lightly be dismissed.\"{{sfn|Schwartz|1992|p=400}} More information on the potential fate of Pontius Pilate can be gleaned from other sources. The second-century pagan philosopher [[Celsus]] polemically asked why, if Jesus was God, God had not punished Pilate, indicating that he did not believe that Pilate shamefully committed suicide. Responding to Celsus, the Christian apologist [[Origen]], writing c. 248, argued that nothing bad happened to Pilate, because the Jews and not Pilate were responsible for Jesus' death; he therefore also assumed that Pilate did not die a shameful death.{{sfn|Maier|1971|p=370}}{{sfn|Gr\u00fcll|2010|p=154\u2013155}} Pilate's supposed suicide is also left unmentioned in Josephus, Philo, or Tacitus.{{sfn|Maier|1971|p=370}} Maier argues that \"[i]n all probability, then, the fate of Pontius Pilate lay clearly in the direction of a retired government official, a pensioned Roman ex-magistrate, than in anything more disastrous.\"{{sfn|Maier|1971|p=371}} Taylor notes that Philo discusses Pilate as though he were already dead in the ''Embassy to Gaius'', although he is writing only a few years after Pilate's tenure as governor.{{sfn|Taylor|2006|p=578}}\n\n==Archaeology and minted coins==\n[[File:Pilate Inscription.JPG|thumb|The so-called [[Pilate Stone]].

Perhaps the earliest apocryphal texts attributed to Pilate are denunciations of Christianity and of Jesus that claim to be Pilate's report on the crucifixion. According to [[Eusebius]] ([[Church History (Eusebius)|''Church History'']] 9.2.5), these texts were distributed during the persecution of Christians conducted by the emperor [[Maximinus II]] (reigned 308\u2013313).

\"Herod\" asks Pilate to pray for him.{{sfn|Carter|2003|pp=10\u201311}}\n\nIn the so-called ''Book of the Cock'', a late-antique apocryphal passion Gospel only preserved in [[Ge'ez]] (Ethiopic) but translated from Arabic,{{sfn|Piovanelli|2003|pp=427-428}} Pilate attempts to avoid Jesus's execution by sending him to Herod and writing further letters arguing with Herod not to execute Jesus.

In the ''[[Cura sanitatis Tiberii]]'' (dated variously 5th to 7th c.),{{sfn|Gounelle|2011|p=233}} the emperor Tiberius is healed by an image of Jesus brought by [[Saint Veronica]], [[Saint Peter]] then confirms Pilate's report on Jesus's miracles, and Pilate is exiled by the emperor [[Nero]], after which he commits suicide.{{sfn|Gr\u00fcll|2010|p=162}} A similar narrative plays out in the ''[[Vindicta Salvatoris]]'' (8th c.).{{sfn|Gr\u00fcll|2010|p=162}}{{sfn|Gounelle|2011|pp=243-244}} In the ''Mors Pilati'' (perhaps originally 6th c., but recorded c. 1300),{{sfn|Hourihane|2009|p=36}} Pilate was forced to commit suicide and his body thrown in the Tiber. However, the body is surrounded by demons and storms, so that it is removed from the Tiber and instead cast into the Rhone, where the same thing happens.

The king reads in the stars that he will bear a son who will rule over many lands, so he has a miller's daughter named Pila brought to him whom he impregnates; Pilate's name thus results from the combination of the names ''Pila'' with ''Atus''. A few years later, Pilate is brought to his father's court where he kills his half-brother. As a result, he is sent as a hostage to Rome, where he kills another hostage. As punishment he is sent to the island of Pontius, whose inhabitants he subjugates, thus acquiring the name Pontius Pilate. King Herod hears of this accomplishment and asks him to come to Palestine to aid his rule there; Pilate comes but soon usurps Herod's power.{{sfn|Martin|1973|pp=101\u2013102}} The trial and judgment of Jesus then happens as in the gospels. The emperor in Rome is suffering from a terrible disease at this time, and hearing of Christ's healing powers, sends for him only to learn from [[Saint Veronica]] that Christ has been crucified, but she possesses a cloth with the image of his face. Pilate is taken as a prisoner with her to Rome to be judged, but every time the emperor sees Pilate to condemn him, his anger dissipates. This is revealed to be because Pilate is wearing Jesus's coat; when the coat is removed, the Emperor condemns him to death, but Pilate commits suicide first. The body is first thrown in the Tiber, but because it causes storms it is then moved to Vienne, and then thrown in a lake in the high Alps.{{sfn|Martin|1973|pp=102\u2013103}}\n\nOne important version of the Pilate legend is found in the ''[[Golden Legend]]'' by [[Jacobus de Voragine]] (1263\u20131273), one of the most popular books of the later Middle Ages.{{sfn|Martin|1973|p=109}} In the ''Golden Legend'', Pilate is portrayed as closely associated with [[Judas]], first coveting the fruit in the orchard of Judas's father Ruben, then granting Judas Ruben's property after Judas has killed his own father.{{sfn|Hourihane|2009|p=234}}\n\nSeveral places in Western Europe have traditions associated with Pilate. The cities of [[Lyon]] and [[Vienne]] in modern France claim to be Pilate's birthplace: Vienne has a ''Maison de Pilate'', a ''Pr\u00e9toire de Pilate'' and a ''Tour de Pilate''.{{sfn|Demandt|2012|p=104}} One tradition states the Pilate was banished to Vienne where a Roman ruin is associated with his tomb; according to another, Pilate took refuge in a mountain (now called [[Mount Pilatus]]) in modern Switzerland, before eventually committing suicide in a lake on its summit.{{sfn|Gr\u00fcll|2010|p=164}} This connection to Mount Pilatus is attested from 1273 onwards, while [[Lake Lucerne]] has been called \"Pilatus-See\" (Pilate Lake) beginning in the fourteenth century.{{sfn|Demandt|2012|pp=104\u2013105}} A number of traditions also connected Pilate to Germany.

He is frequently depicted as a more important character to the narrative than even Jesus,{{sfn|Hourihane|2009|p=363}} and became one of the most important figures of medieval drama in the fifteenth century.{{sfn|Hourihane|2009|p=296}} The three most popular scenes in the plays to include Pilate are his washing of hands, the warning of his wife Procula not to harm Jesus, and the writing of the ''titulus'' on Jesus' cross.{{sfn|Hourihane|2009|p=297}} Pilate's characterization varies greatly from play to play, but later plays frequently portray Pilate somewhat ambiguously, though he is usually a negative character, and sometimes an evil villain.{{sfn|Hourihane|2009|pp=363\u2013364}} While in some plays Pilate is opposed to the Jews and condemns them, in others he describes himself as a Jew or supports their wish to kill Christ.{{sfn|Hourihane|2009|p=364}}\n\nIn the passion plays from the continental Western Europe, Pilate's characterization varies from good to evil, but he is mostly a benign figure.{{sfn|Hourihane|2009|p=365}} The earliest surviving passion play, the thirteenth-century {{lang|la|Ludus de Passione|italics=yes}} from [[Klosterneuburg]], portrays Pilate as a weak administrator who succumbs to the whims of the Jews in having Christ crucified.{{sfn|Hourihane|2009|p=237}} Pilate goes on to play an important role in the increasingly long and elaborate passion plays performed in the German-speaking countries and in France.{{sfn|Hourihane|2009|pp=365\u2013366}} In [[Arnoul Gr\u00e9ban]]'s fifteenth-century ''Passion'', Pilate instructs the flagellators on how best to whip Jesus.{{sfn|Hourihane|2009|pp=283\u2013284}} The 1517 {{lang|de|Alsfelder Passionsspiel|italics=yes}} portrays Pilate as condemning Christ to death out of fear of losing Herod's friendship and to earn the Jews' good will, despite his long dialogues with the Jews in which he professes Christ's innocence. He eventually becomes a Christian himself.{{sfn|Hourihane|2009|pp=366\u2013367}} In the 1493 {{lang|de|Frankfurter Passionsspiel|italics=yes}}, on the other hand, Pilate himself accuses Christ.{{sfn|Hourihane|2009|pp=367\u2013368}} The fifteenth-century German Benediktbeuern passion play depicts Pilate as a good friend of Herod's, kissing him in a reminiscence of the kiss of Judas.{{sfn|Hourihane|2009|p=252}} Colum Hourihane argues that all of these plays supported antisemitic tropes and were written at times when persecution of Jews on the continent were high.{{sfn|Hourihane|2009|pp=368\u2013369}}\n\nThe fifteenth-century Roman {{lang|it|Passione|italics=yes}} depicts Pilate as trying to save Jesus against the wishes of the Jews.{{sfn|Hourihane|2009|p=364}} In the Italian passion plays, Pilate never identifies himself as a Jew, condemning them in the fifteenth-century {{lang|it|Resurrezione|italics=yes}} and stressing the Jews' fear of the \"new law\" of Christ.{{sfn|Hourihane|2009|pp=364\u2013365}}\n\nHourihane argues that in England, where the Jews had been expelled in 1290, Pilate's characterization may have been used primarily to satyrize corrupt officials and judges rather than to stoke antisemitism.{{sfn|Hourihane|2009|p=265}} In several English plays, Pilate is portrayed speaking French or Latin, the languages of the ruling classes and the law.{{sfn|Wroe|1999|pp=177\u2013178}} In the Wakefield plays, Pilate is portrayed as wickedly evil, describing himself as Satan's agent ({{lang|la|mali actoris|italics=yes}}) while plotting Christ's torture so as to extract the most pain. He nonetheless washes his hands of guilt after the tortures have been administered.{{sfn|Hourihane|2009|p=286}} Yet many scholars believe the motif of the conniving devil and the Jews to be inextricably linked. By the thirteenth century, medieval arts and literature had a well-established tradition of the Jew as the Devil in disguise. <ref name=\":0\" /> Thus, some scholars believe that Anti-Judaism still lies near the heart of the matter.<ref name=\":0\" /> In the fifteenth-century English Townley Cycle, Pilate is portrayed as a pompous lord and prince of the Jews, but also as forcing Christ's torturer to give him Christ's clothes at the foot of the cross.{{sfn|Hourihane|2009|p=243}} It is he alone who wishes to kill Christ rather than the high priests, conspiring together with Judas.{{sfn|Hourihane|2009|p=297, 328}} In the fifteenth-century English York passion play, Pilate judges Jesus together with [[Annas]] and [[Caiaphas]], becoming a central character of the passion narrative who converses with and instructs other characters.{{sfn|Hourihane|2009|pp=243\u2013245}} In this play, when Judas comes back to Pilate and the priests to tell them he no longer wishes to betray Jesus, Pilate browbeats Judas into going through with the plan.{{sfn|Wroe|1999|pp=213\u2013214}} Not only does Pilate force Judas to betray Christ, he double-crosses him and refuses to take him on as a servant once Judas has done so. Moreover, Pilate also swindles his way into possession of the [[Potter's field]], thus owning the land on which Judas commits suicide.{{sfn|Hourihane|2009|p=328}} In the York passion cycle, Pilate describes himself as a courtier, but in most English passion plays he proclaims his royal ancestry.{{sfn|Hourihane|2009|p=297}} The actor who portrayed Pilate in the English plays would typically speak loudly and authoritatively, a fact which was parodied in [[Geoffrey Chaucer]]'s ''[[Canterbury Tales]]''.{{sfn|Hourihane|2009|p=352}}\n\nThe fifteenth century also sees Pilate as a character in plays based on legendary material: one, {{Lang|fr|La Vengeance de Nostre-Seigneur|italics=yes}}, exists in two dramatic treatments focusing on the horrible fates that befell Christ's tormenters: it portrays Pilate being tied to a pillar, covered with oil and honey, and then slowly dismembered over 21 days; he is carefully tended to so that he does not die until the end.{{sfn|Hourihane|2009|p=317}} Another play focusing on Pilate's death is Cornish and based on the {{lang|la|Mors Pilati|italics=yes}}.{{sfn|Hourihane|2009|p=318}} The {{lang|fr|Myst\u00e8re de la Passion d'Angers|italics=yes}} by [[Jean Michel (poet)|Jean Michel]] includes legendary scenes of Pilate's life before the passion.{{sfn|Hourihane|2009|p=365}}\n\n===Modern literature===\nPontius Pilate appears as a character in a large number of literary works, typically as a character in the judgment of Christ.{{sfn|MacAdam|2001|p=90}} One of the earliest literary works in which he plays a large role is French writer [[Anatole France]]'s 1892 short story {{lang|fr|\"Le Procurateur de Jud\u00e9e\"|italics=no}} (\"The Procurator of Judaea\"), which portrays an elderly Pilate who has been banished to [[Sicily]]. There he lives happily as a farmer and is looked after by his daughter, but suffers from gout and obesity and broods over his time as governor of Judaea.{{sfn|Wroe|1999|p=358}} Spending his time at the baths of [[Baiae]], Pilate is unable to remember Jesus at all.{{sfn|Demandt|2012|p=107}}\n\nPilate makes a brief appearance in the preface to [[George Bernard Shaw]]'s 1933 play ''[[On the Rocks: A Political Comedy|On the Rocks]]'' where he argues against Jesus about the dangers of revolution and of new ideas.{{sfn|Wroe|1999|p=195}} Shortly afterwards, French writer [[Roger Caillois]] wrote a novel ''Pontius Pilate'' (1936), in which Pilate acquits Jesus.{{sfn|MacAdam|2017|p=133}}\n\nPilate features prominently in Russian author [[Mikhail Bulgakov]]'s novel ''[[The Master and Margarita]]'', which was written in the 1930s but only published in 1966, twenty six years after the author's death.{{sfn|Langenhorst|1995|p=90}} Henry I. MacAdam describes it as \"the 'cult classic' of Pilate-related fiction.\"{{sfn|MacAdam|2017|p=133}} The work features a novel within the novel about Pontius Pilate and his encounter with Jesus by an author only called the Master. Because of this subject matter, the Master has been attacked for \"Pilatism\" by the Soviet literary establishment. Five chapters of the novel are featured as chapters of ''The Master and Margarita''. In them, Pilate is portrayed as wishing to save Jesus, being affected by his charisma, but as too cowardly to do so. Russian critics in the 1960s interpreted this Pilate as \"a model of the spineless provincial bureaucrats of Stalinist Russia.\"{{sfn|Wroe|1999|p=273}} Pilate becomes obsessed with his guilt for having killed Jesus.{{sfn|Ziolkowski|1992|p=165}} Because he betrayed his desire to follow his morality and free Jesus, Pilate must suffer for eternity.{{sfn|Bond|1998|p=xiii}} Pilate's burden of guilt is finally lifted by the Master when he encounters him at the end of Bulgakov's novel.{{sfn|Wroe|1999|p=371}}\n\nThe majority of literary texts about Pilate come from the time after the Second World War, a fact which Alexander Demandt suggests shows a cultural dissatisfaction with Pilate having washed his hands of guilt.{{sfn|Demandt|2012|p=107}} One of Swiss writer [[Friedrich D\u00fcrrenmatt]]'s earliest stories (\"Pilatus,\" 1949) portrays Pilate as aware that he is torturing God in the trial of Jesus.{{sfn|Demandt|2012|p=108}} Swiss playwright [[Max Frisch]]'s comedy {{lang|de|Die chinesische Mauer|italics=yes}} portrays Pilate as a skeptical intellectual who refuses to take responsibility for the suffering he has caused.{{sfn|Demandt|2012|pp=107\u2013109}} The German Catholic novelist [[Gertrud von Le Fort]]'s {{lang|de|Die Frau des Pilatus|italics=yes}} portrays Pilate's wife as converting to Christianity after attempting to save Jesus and assuming Pilate's guilt for herself; Pilate executes her as well.{{sfn|Demandt|2012|p=108}}\n\nIn 1986, Soviet-Kyrgiz writer [[Chingiz Aitmatov]] published a novel in Russian featuring Pilate titled {{lang|ru|Placha|italics=yes}} (''The Place of the Skull''). The novel centers on an extended dialogue between Pilate and Jesus witnessed in a vision by the narrator Avdii Kallistratov, a former seminarian. Pilate is presented as an materialist pessimist who believes mankind will soon destroy itself, whereas Jesus offers a message of hope.{{sfn|Langenhorst|1995|p=90}} Among other topics, the two anachronistically discuss the meaning of the last judgment and the second coming; Pilate fails to comprehend Jesus's teachings and is complacent as he sends him to his death.{{sfn|Ziolkowski|1992|pp=167\u2013168}}\n\n===Film===\nPilate has been depicted in a number of films, being included in portrayals of Christ's passion already in some of the earliest films produced.{{sfn|McDonough|2009|p=278-2280}} In the 1927 silent film ''[[The King of Kings (1927 film)|The King of Kings]]'', Pilate is played by Hungarian-American actor [[Victor Varconi]], who is introduced seated under an enormous 37 feet high [[Aquila (Roman)|Roman eagle]], which Christopher McDonough argues symbolizes \"not power that he possesses but power that possesses him\".{{sfn|McDonough|2009|p=283}} During the ''Ecce homo'' scene, the eagle stands in the background between Jesus and Pilate, with a wing above each figure; after hesitantly condemning Jesus, Pilate passes back to the eagle, which is now framed beside him, showing his isolation in his decision and, McDonough suggests, causing the audience to question how well he has served the emperor.{{sfn|McDonough|2009|pp=284-285}}\n\nThe film ''[[The Last Days of Pompeii (1935 film)|The Last Days of Pompeii]]'' (1935) portrays Pilate as \"a representative of the gross materialism of the Roman empire\", with the actor [[Basil Rathbone]] giving him long fingers and a long nose.{{sfn|Wroe|1999|pp=38\u201339}} Following the Second World War, Pilate and the Romans often take on a villainous role in American film.{{sfn|Winkler|1998|p=167}} The 1953 film ''[[The Robe (film)|The Robe]]'' portrays Pilate as completely covered with gold and rings as a sign of Roman decadence.{{sfn|Wroe|1999|p=39}} The 1959 film ''[[Ben-Hur (1959 film)|Ben-Hur]]'' shows Pilate presiding over a chariot race, in a scene that Ann Wroe says \"seemed closely modeled on the Hitler footage of the [[1936 Summer Olympics|1936 Olympics]],\" with Pilate bored and sneering.{{sfn|Wroe|1999|p=186}} Martin Winkler, however, argues that ''Ben-Hur'' provides a more nuanced and less condemnatory portrayal of Pilate and the Roman Empire than most American films of the period.{{sfn|Winkler|1998|p=192}}\n\n[[File:Ponzio Pilato 1962 Marais.png|thumb|Jean Marais as Pontius Pilate in {{lang|it|Ponzio Pilato|italics=yes}} (1962)]]\nOnly one film has been made entirely in Pilate's perspective, the 1962 French-Italian ''[[Ponzio Pilato]]'', where Pilate was played by [[Jean Marais]].{{sfn|Wroe|1999|p=39}} In the 1973 film [[Jesus Christ Superstar (film)|''Jesus Christ Superstar'']], the trial of Jesus takes place in the ruins of a Roman theater, suggesting the collapse of Roman authority and \"the collapse of all authority, political or otherwise\".{{sfn|McDonough|2009|p=287}} The Pilate in the film, played by [[Barry Dennen]], expands on [[John 18:38]] to question Jesus on the truth and appears, in McDonough's view, as \"an anxious representative of [...] moral relativism\".{{sfn|McDonough|2009|p=287}} Speaking of Dennen's portrayal in the trial scene, McDonough describes him as a \"cornered animal.\"{{sfn|McDonough|2009|p=290}} Wroe argues that later Pilates took on a sort of effeminancy,{{sfn|Wroe|1999|p=39}} illustrated by the Pilate in ''[[Monty Python's Life of Brian]]'', where Pilate lisps and mispronounces his r's as w's. In [[Martin Scorsese]]'s ''[[The Last Temptation of Christ (film)|The Last Temptation of Christ]]'' (1988), Pilate is played by [[David Bowie]], who appears as \"gaunt and eerily hermaphrodite.\"{{sfn|Wroe|1999|p=39}} Bowie's Pilate speaks with a British accent, contrasting with the American accent of Jesus ([[Willem Dafoe]]).{{sfn|McDonough|2009|pp=290-291}} The trial takes place in Pilate's private stables, implying that Pilate does not think the judgment of Jesus very important, and no attempt is made to take any responsibility from Pilate for Jesus's death, which he orders without any qualms.{{sfn|McDonough|2009|pp=291-293}}\n\n[[Mel Gibson]]'s 2004 film ''[[The Passion of the Christ]]'' portrays Pilate, played by [[Hristo Shopov]], as a sympathetic, noble-minded character,{{sfn|Grace|2004|p=16}} fearful that the Jewish priest Caiaphas will start an uprising if he does not give in to his demands. He expresses disgust at the Jewish authorities' treatment of Jesus when Jesus is brought before him and offers Jesus a drink of water.{{sfn|Grace|2004|p=16}} McDonough argues that \"Shopov gives US a very subtle Pilate, one who manages to appear alarmed though not panicked before the crowd, but who betrays far greater misgivings in private conversation with his wife.\"{{sfn|McDonough|2009|p=295}}\n\n==Legacy==\nPontius Pilate is mentioned as having been involved in the crucifixion in both the [[Nicene Creed]] and the [[Apostles Creed]]. The Apostles Creed states that Jesus \"suffered under Pontius Pilate, was crucified, died, and was buried.\"<ref>{{cite web|title=The Apostles' Creed|url=https://www.cardinalnewman.com.au/images/stories/downloads/The%20Apostles%20Creed.pdf|publisher=Cardinal Newman Catechist Consultants|access-date=15 July 2019|date=2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190302101028/http://cardinalnewman.com.au/images/stories/downloads/The%20Apostles%20Creed.pdf|archive-date=2 March 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> The Nicene Creed states \"For our sake [Jesus] was crucified under Pontius Pilate; he suffered death and was buried.\"<ref>[[s:Nicene Creed (ECUSA Book of Common Prayer)|Nicene Creed in English]]</ref> These creeds are recited weekly by many Christians.{{sfn|Carter|2003|p=1}} Pilate is the only person besides Jesus and [[Mary, Mother of Jesus|Mary]] mentioned by name in the creeds.{{sfn|Hourihane|2009|p=391}} The mention of Pilate in the creeds serves to mark the passion as a historical event.{{sfn|Bayes|2010|p=78}}\n\nHe is venerated as a saint by the [[Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church|Ethiopian Church]] with a feast day on June 19,{{sfn|Gr\u00fcll|2010|p=167}}{{sfn|Carter|2003|p=11}} and by the [[Coptic Church]], with a feast day of June 25.{{sfn|Hourihane|2009|p=4}}\n\nPilate's washing his hands of responsibility for Jesus's death in Matthew 27:24 is a commonly encountered image in the popular imagination,{{sfn|Bond|1998|p=xi}} and is the origin of the English phrase [[Wiktionary:wash one's hands of|\"to wash one's hands of (the matter)\"]], meaning to refuse further involvement with or responsibility for something.{{sfn|Martin|2019}} Parts of the dialogue attributed to Pilate in the [[Gospel of John]] have become particularly famous sayings, especially quoted in the Latin version of the [[Vulgate]].{{Sfn|MacAdam|2017|p=139}} These include {{bibleverse|John|18:35|KJV}} ({{Lang|la|numquid ego Iudaeus sum?|italics=yes}} \"Am I a Jew?\"), [[John 18:38]] ({{Lang|la|Quid est veritas?|italics=yes}}; \"what is truth?\"), [[John 19#Verse 5|John 19:5]] ({{Lang|la|[[Ecce homo]]|italics=yes}}, \"Behold the man!\"), {{bibleverse|John|19:14|KJV}} ({{lang|la|Ecce rex vester|italics=yes}}, \"Behold your king!\"), and {{bibleverse|John|19:22|KJV}} ({{lang|la|[[Quod scripsi, scripsi]]|italics=yes}}, \"What I have written, I have written\").{{Sfn|MacAdam|2017|p=139}}\n\nThe Gospels' deflection of responsibility for Jesus's crucifixion from Pilate to the Jews has been blamed for fomenting [[antisemitism]] from the Middle Ages through the nineteenth and twentieth centuries.{{sfn|Wroe|1999|pp=331\u2013332}}\n\n===Scholarly assessments===\nThe main ancient sources on Pilate offer very different views on his governorship and personality. Philo is hostile, Josephus mostly neutral, and the Gospels \"comparatively friendly.\"{{sfn|McGing|1991|pp=415\u2013416}} This, combined with the general lack of information on Pilate's long time in office, has resulted in a wide range of assessments by modern scholars.{{sfn|Carter|2003|pp=12\u201319}}\n\nOn the basis of the many offenses that Pilate caused to the Judaean populace, some scholars find Pilate to have been a particularly bad governor. M. P. Charlesworth argues that Pilate was \"a man whose character and capacity fell below those of the ordinary provincial official [...] in ten years he had piled blunder on blunder in his scorn for and misunderstanding of the people he was sent to rule.\"{{sfn|Maier|1971|p=363}} However, Paul Maier argues that Pilate's long term as governor of Judaea indicates he must have been a reasonably competent administrator,{{sfn|Maier|1971|p=365}} while Henry MacAdam argues that \"[a]mong the Judaean governors prior to the Jewish War, Pilate must be ranked as more capable than most.\"{{sfn|MacAdam|2001|p=77}} Other scholars have argued that Pilate was simply culturally insensitive in his interactions with the Jews and in this way a typical Roman official.{{sfn|Carter|2003|pp=5\u20136}}\n\nBeginning with E. Stauffer in 1948, scholars have argued, on the basis of his possible appointment by [[Sejanus]], that Pilate's offenses against the Jews were directed by Sejanus out of hatred of the Jews and a desire to destroy their nation, a theory supported by the pagan imagery on Pilate's coins.{{sfn|Maier|1968|pp=9\u201310}} According to this theory, following Sejanus's execution in 31 CE and Tiberius's purges of his supporters, Pilate, fearful of being removed himself, became far more cautious, explaining his apparently weak and vaciliating attitude at the trial of Jesus.{{sfn|Maier|1968|pp=10\u201311}} Helen Bond argues that \"[g]iven the history of pagan designs throughout Judaean coinage, particularly from Herod and Gratus, Pilate's coins do not seem to be deliberately offensive,\"{{sfn|Bond|1998|p=21}} and that the coins offer little evidence of any connection between Pilate and Sejanus.{{sfn|Bond|1998|p=22}} Carter notes this theory arose in the context of the aftermath of the [[Holocaust]], that the evidence that Sejanus was anti-Semitic depends entirely on Philo, and that \"[m]ost scholars have not been convinced that it is an accurate or a fair picture of Pilate.\"{{sfn|Carter|2003|p=4}}\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of biblical figures identified in extra-biblical sources]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{notelist}}\n\n==Citations==\n{{Reflist|20em}}\n\n== References ==\n{{refbegin|30em}}\n* {{cite journal| last1=Amora-Stark |first1=Shua |display-authors=etal |title= An Inscribed Copper-Alloy Finger Ring from Herodium Depicting a Krater |journal=Israel Exploration Journal |volume= 68 |issue=2 |year=2018 |pages=208\u2013220|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/329307909 |ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book |editor-last=Ash |editor-first=Rhiannon |title=Tacitus Annals.

He is best known today for being the official who presided over the [[Pilate's court|trial]] of [[Jesus]] and ordered his [[crucifixion of Jesus|crucifixion]]. Pilate's importance in modern Christianity is underscored by his prominent place in both the [[Apostles' Creed|Apostles]] and [[Nicene Creed]]s. Due to the Gospels' portrayal of Pilate as reluctant to execute Jesus, the [[Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria|Coptic]] and [[Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church|Ethiopian Churches]] believe that Pilate became a Christian and venerate him as a [[martyr]] and [[saint]].{{sfnm|1a1=Carter|1y=2003|1p=11|2a1=Gr\u00fcll|2y=2010|2p=167}}\n\nAlthough Pilate is the best-attested governor of Judaea, few sources on his rule have survived. He appears to have belonged to the well-attested [[Pontia gens|Pontii]] family, but nothing is known for certain about his life before he became governor of Judaea, nor of the circumstances that led to his appointment to the governorship.{{sfnm|1a1=Schwartz|1y=1992|1p=398|2a1=L\u00e9monon|2y=2007|2p=121}} A single inscription from Pilate's governorship has survived, the so-called [[Pilate stone]], as have coins that he minted. The Jewish historian [[Josephus]] and philosopher [[Philo of Alexandria]] both mention incidents of tension and violence between the Jewish population and Pilate's administration. Many of these involve Pilate acting in ways that offended the religious sensibilities of the Jews. The Christian [[Gospels]] record that Pilate ordered the crucifixion of Jesus at some point during his time in office; Josephus and the Roman historian [[Tacitus]] also appear to have recorded this information. According to Josephus, Pilate's removal from office occurred because he violently suppressed an armed [[Samaritans|Samaritan]] movement at [[Mount Gerizim]]. He was sent back to Rome by the legate of [[Roman Syria|Syria]] to answer for this before Tiberius, who, however, had died before he arrived. Nothing is known for certain about what happened to him after this. On the basis of a mention in the second-century pagan philosopher [[Celsus]] and Christian apologist [[Origen]], most modern historians believe that Pilate simply retired after his dismissal.{{sfnm|1a1=Maier|1y=1971|1p=371|2a1=Demandt|2y=2012|2pp=92\u201393}} Modern historians have differing assessments of Pilate as an effective ruler; while some believe he was a particularly brutal and ineffective governor, others argue that his long time in office means he must have been reasonably competent. According to one prominent [[post-war]] theory, Pilate was motivated by [[antisemitism]] in his treatment of the Jews, but this theory has been mostly abandoned.{{sfnm|1a1=Bond|1y=1998|1p=22|2a1=Carter|2y=2003|3p=4}}\n\nIn [[Late Antiquity]] and the [[Early Middle Ages]], Pilate became the focus of a large group of [[New Testament apocrypha]] expanding on his role in the Gospels. In many of these, particularly the earlier texts from the [[Eastern Roman Empire]], Pilate was portrayed as a positive figure. In some, he became a Christian [[martyr]]. In later, particularly Western Christian texts, he was instead portrayed as a negative figure and villain, with traditions surrounding his death by suicide featuring prominently. Pilate was also the focus of numerous medieval [[legend]]s, which invented a complete biography for him and portrayed him as villainous and cowardly. Many of these legends connected Pilate's place of birth or death to particular locations around [[Western Europe]].\n\nPilate has frequently been a subject of artistic representation. [[Medieval art]] frequently portrayed scenes of Pilate and Jesus, often in the scene where he washes his hands of guilt for Jesus's death. In the art of the [[Late Middle Ages]] and the [[Renaissance]], Pilate is often depicted as a Jew. The nineteenth century saw a renewed interest in depicting Pilate, with numerous images made. He plays an important role in medieval [[passion plays]], where he is often a more prominent character than Jesus. His characterization in these plays varies greatly, from weak-willed and coerced into crucifying Jesus to being an evil person who demands Jesus's crucifixion. Modern authors who feature Pilate prominently in their works include [[Anatole France]], [[Mikhail Bulgakov]], and [[Chingiz Aitmatov]], with a majority of modern treatments of Pilate dating to after the [[Second World War]]. Pilate has also frequently been portrayed in film.\n\n==Life==\n===Sources===\nSources on Pontius Pilate are limited, although modern scholars know more about him than about other [[Roman administration of Judaea (AD 6\u2013135)|Roman governors of Judaea]].{{sfn|Carter|2003|p=12}} The most important sources are the ''Embassy to Gaius'' (after 41 CE) by contemporary Jewish writer [[Philo of Alexandria]],{{sfn|Demandt|2012|p=34|ps=. \"Nach dem Tod des Caligula, unter Claudius, schrieb Philo seine 'Legatio'.\"}} the ''Jewish Wars'' (c. 74 CE) and ''Antiquities of the Jews'' (c. 94 CE) by the Jewish historian [[Josephus]], as well as the four canonical Christian [[Gospel]]s, [[Gospel of Mark|Mark]] (composed between 66 and 70 CE), [[Gospel of Luke|Luke]] (composed between 85 and 90 CE), [[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]] (composed between 85 and 90 CE), and [[Gospel of John|John]] (composed between 90 and 110 CE).{{sfn|Carter|2003|p=12}} [[Ignatius of Antioch]] mentions him in his epistles to the [[Epistle of Ignatius to the Trallians|Trallians]], [[Epistle of Ignatius to the Magnesians|Magnesians]], and [[Epistle of Ignatius to the Smyrnaeans|Smyrnaeans]]{{sfn|Bayes|2010|p=79}} (composed between 105 and 110 CE).{{sfn|Trebilco|2007|p=631}} He is also briefly mentioned in ''[[Annals (Tacitus)|Annals]]'' of the Roman historian [[Tacitus]] (early 2nd c. CE), who simply says that he put Jesus to death.{{sfn|Carter|2003|p=12}} Two additional chapters of Tacitus's ''Annals'' that might have mentioned Pilate have been lost.{{sfn|Wroe|1999|p=xii}} Besides these texts, coins minted by Pilate have survived, as well as a fragmentary short inscription that names Pilate, known as the [[Pilate Stone]], the only inscription about a Roman governor of Judaea predating the [[Roman-Jewish Wars]] to survive.{{sfn|Carter|2003|pp=12\u201313}}{{sfn|MacAdam|2001|p=75}} The written sources provide only limited information and each has its own biases, with the gospels in particular providing a theological rather than historical perspective on Pilate.{{sfn|Carter|2003|pp=12\u201319}}\n\n===Early life===\nThe sources give no indication of Pilate's life prior to his becoming governor of Judaea.{{sfn|L\u00e9monon|2007|p=121}} His [[praenomen]] (first name) is unknown;{{sfn|L\u00e9monon|2007|p=16}} his [[cognomen]] ''Pilatus'' might mean \"skilled with the javelin ({{Lang|la|[[pilum]]|italics=yes}}),\" but it could also refer to the {{Lang|la|[[Pileus (hat)|pileus]]|italics=yes}} or [[Phrygian cap]], possibly indicating that one of Pilate's ancestors was a [[freedman]].{{sfn|Demandt|2012|p=47\u201348}} If it means \"skilled with the javelin,\" it is possible that Pilate won the cognomen for himself while serving in the [[Military of ancient Rome|Roman military]];{{sfn|L\u00e9monon|2007|p=121}} it is also possible that his father acquired the cognomen through military skill.{{sfn|Wroe|1999|p=16}} In the Gospels of Mark and John, Pilate is only called by his cognomen, which Marie-Joseph Ollivier takes to mean that this was the name by which he was generally known in common speech.{{sfn|Ollivier|1896|p=252}} The name ''Pontius'' indicates that he belonged to the [[Pontia gens|Pontii family]],{{sfn|L\u00e9monon|2007|p=16}} a well-known family of [[Samnites|Samnite]] origin which produced a number of important individuals in the late [[Roman Republic|Republic]] and [[Principate|early Empire]].{{sfn|Demandt|2012|pp=46\u201347}} Like all but one other governor of Judaea, Pilate was of the [[equites|equestrian order]], a middle rank of the Roman nobility.{{sfn|Bond|1998|p=9}} As one of the attested Pontii, [[Pontius Aquila]], an assassin of [[Julius Caesar]], was a [[Tribune of the Plebs]], the family must have originally been of [[Plebs|Plebeian]] origin. They became ennobled as equestrians.{{sfn|Demandt|2012|pp=46\u201347}}\n\nPilate was likely educated, somewhat wealthy, and well-connected politically and socially.{{sfn|Carter|2003|p=15}} He was probably married, but the only extant reference to [[Pontius Pilate's wife|his wife]], in which she tells him after a disturbing dream not to interact with Jesus ({{bibleverse|Matthew|27:19|KJV}}), is generally dismissed as legendary.{{sfnm|1a1=Bond|1y=1998|1p=197|2a1=Demandt|2y=2012|2pp=76-77|3a1=L\u00e9monon|3y=2007|3p=167}} According to the ''[[Tres militiae|cursus honorum]]'' established by [[Augustus]] for office holders of equestrian rank, Pilate would have had a military command before becoming prefect of Judaea; [[Alexander Demandt]] speculates that this could have been with a legion stationed at the [[Rhine]] or [[Danube]].{{sfn|Demandt|2012|p=48}} Although it is therefore likely Pilate served in the military, it is nevertheless not certain.{{sfn|L\u00e9monon|2007|pp=121\u2013122}}\n\n===Role as governor of Judaea===\n[[File:First century Iudaea province.gif|thumb|Map of the province of Judaea during Pilate's governorship in the first century CE.]]\nPilate was the fifth governor of the Roman province of Judaea, during the reign of the emperor [[Tiberius]]. The post of governor of Judaea was of relatively low prestige and nothing is known of how Pilate obtained the office.{{sfn|Schwartz|1992|p=398}} Josephus states that Pilate governed for 10 years (''[[Antiquities of the Jews]]'' 18.4.2), and these are traditionally dated from 26 to 36/37 CE, making him one of the two longest-serving governors of the province.{{sfn|Bond|1998|p=8}} As Tiberius had retired to the island of [[Capri]] in 26 CE, scholars such as E. Stauffer have argued that Pilate may have actually been appointed by the powerful [[Praetorian Prefect]] [[Sejanus]], who was executed for treason in 31 CE.{{sfn|Maier|1968|pp=8\u20139}} Other scholars have cast doubt on any link between Pilate and Sejanus.{{sfnm|1a1=McGing|1y=1991|1p=427|2a1=Carter|2y=2003|2p=4|3a1=Schwartz|3y=1992|3p=398}} [[Daniel R. Schwartz]] and Kenneth L\u00f6nnqvist both argue that the traditional dating of the beginning of Pilate's governorship is based on an error in Josephus; Schwartz argues that he was appointed instead in 19 CE, while L\u00f6nnqvist argues for 17/18 CE.{{sfn|Schwartz|1992|pp=396\u2013397}}{{sfn|L\u00f6nnqvist|2000|p=67}} This redating has not been widely accepted by other scholars.{{sfn|L\u00e9monon|2007|p=122}}\n\nPilate's title of prefect{{efn|Pilate's title as governor, as attested on the Pilate stone, is \"[[Prefect#Ancient Rome|prefect]] of Judaea\" ({{Lang|la|praefectus Iudaeae|italics=yes}}). His title is given as {{Lang|la|[[Procurator (Ancient Rome)|procurator]]|italics=yes}} in Tacitus, and with the Greek equivalent {{Transl|grc|epitropos|italics=yes}} ({{Lang|grc|\u1f10\u03c0\u03af\u03c4\u03c1\u03bf\u03c0\u03bf\u03c2|italics=no}}) in Josephus and Philo.{{sfn|Schwartz|1992|p=397}} The title prefect was later changed to \"procurator\" under the emperor [[Claudius]], explaining why later sources give Pilate this title.{{sfn|Bond|1998|pp=11\u201312}} The [[New Testament]] uses the generic Greek term {{Transl|grc|[[Hegemony|hegemon]]|italics=yes}} ({{Lang|grc|\u1f21\u03b3\u03b5\u03bc\u03ce\u03bd|italics=no}}), a term also applied to Pilate in Josephus.{{sfn|Schwartz|1992|p=397}}}} implies that his duties were primarily military;{{sfn|Bond|1998|p=11}} however, Pilate's troops were meant more as a police than a military force, and Pilate's duties extended beyond military matters.{{sfn|Schwartz|1992|p=197}} As Roman governor, he was head of the judicial system. He had the power to inflict [[capital punishment]], and was responsible for collecting tributes and taxes, and for disbursing funds, including the minting of coins.{{sfn|Schwartz|1992|p=197}} Because the Romans allowed a certain degree of local control, Pilate shared a limited amount of civil and religious power with the Jewish [[Sanhedrin]].{{sfn|L\u00e9monon|2007|p=70}}\n\nPilate was subordinate to the legate of [[Roman Syria|Syria]]; however, for the first six years in which he held office, Syria lacked a legate, something which [[Helen Bond]] believes may have presented difficulties to Pilate.{{sfn|Bond|1998|pp=5, 14\u201315}} He seems to have been free to govern the province as he wished, with intervention by the legate of Syria only coming at the end of his tenure.{{sfn|Schwartz|1992|p=398}} Like other Roman governors of Judaea, Pilate made his primary residence in [[Caesarea]], going to [[Jerusalem]] mainly for major feasts in order to maintain order.{{sfn|Bond|1998|pp=7\u20138}} He also would have toured around the province in order to hear cases and administer justice.{{sfn|Carter|2003|p=46}}\n\nAs governor, Pilate had the right to appoint the Jewish [[High Priest of Israel|High Priest]] and also officially controlled the vestiments of the High Priest in the [[Antonia Fortress]].{{sfn|L\u00e9monon|2007|pp=86\u201388}} Unlike his predecessor, [[Valerius Gratus]], Pilate retained the same high priest, [[Caiaphas]], for his entire tenure. Caiaphas would be removed following Pilate's own removal from the governorship.{{sfn|Bond|1998|p=19}} This indicates that Caiaphas and the priests of the [[Sadducees|Sadducee sect]] were reliable allies to Pilate.{{sfn|Carter|2003|p=48}} Moreover, Maier argues that Pilate could not have used the [[temple treasury]] to construct an aqueduct, as recorded by Josephus, without the cooperation of the priests.{{sfn|Maier|1971|p=364}} Similarly, Helen Bond argues that Pilate is depicted working closely with the Jewish authorities in the execution of Jesus.{{sfn|Bond|1998|p=89}} Jean-Pierre L\u00e9monon argues that official cooperation with Pilate was limited to the Sadducees, noting that the [[Pharisees]] are absent from the gospel accounts of Jesus's arrest and trial.{{sfn|L\u00e9monon|2007|p=172}}\n\nDaniel Schwartz takes the note in the [[Gospel of Luke]] ([[Luke 23]]:12) that Pilate had a difficult relationship with the Galilean Jewish king [[Herod Antipas]] as potentially historical. He also finds historical the information that their relationship mended following the execution of Jesus.{{sfn|Schwartz|1992|p=400}} Based on [[John 19]]:12, it is possible that Pilate held the title \"friend of Caesar\" ({{Lang-la|amicus Caesaris|italics=yes}}, {{Lang-grc|\u03c6\u03af\u03bb\u03bf\u03c2 \u03c4\u03bf\u1fe6 K\u03b1\u03af\u03c3\u03b1\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2|italics=no}}), a title also held by the Jewish kings [[Herod Agrippa I]] and [[Herod Agrippa II]] and by close advisors to the emperor. Both Daniel Schwartz and Alexander Demandt do not think this information especially likely.{{sfn|Schwartz|1992|p=398}}{{sfn|Demandt|2012|pp=60\u201361}}\n\n===Incidents with the Jews===\n\nVarious disturbances during Pilate's governship are recorded in the sources. In some cases, it is unclear if they may be referring to the same event,{{sfn|Schwartz|1992|p=399}} and it is difficult to establish a chronology of events for Pilate's rule.{{sfn|MacAdam|2001|p=78}} Joan Taylor argues that Pilate had a policy of promoting the [[imperial cult of ancient Rome|imperial cult]], which may have caused some of the friction with his Jewish subjects.{{sfn|Taylor|2006}} Schwartz suggests that Pilate's entire tenure was characterized by \"continued underlying tension between governor and governed, now and again breaking out in brief incidents.\"{{sfn|Schwartz|1992|p=399}}\n\nAccording to Josephus in his ''[[The Jewish War]]'' (2.9.2) and ''[[Antiquities of the Jews]]'' (18.3.1), Pilate offended the Jews by moving imperial standards with the image of Caesar into Jerusalem. This resulted in a crowd of Jews surrounding Pilate's house in Caesarea for five days. Pilate then summoned them to an [[arena]], where the Roman soldiers drew their swords. But the Jews showed so little fear of death, that Pilate relented and removed the standards.{{sfn|Bond|1998|pp=52\u201353}} Bond argues that the fact that Josephus says that Pilate brought in the standards by night, shows that he knew that the images of the emperor would be offensive.{{sfn|Bond|1998|p=57}} She dates this incident to early in Pilate's tenure as governor.{{sfn|Bond|1998|p=79}} Daniel Schwartz and Alexander Demandt both suggest that this incident is in fact identical with \"the incident with the shields\" reported in Philo's ''Embassy to Gaius'', an identification first made by the early church historian [[Eusebius]].{{sfn|Demandt|2012|pp=53\u201355}}{{sfn|Schwartz|1992|p=399}} L\u00e9monon, however, argues against this identification.{{sfn|L\u00e9monon|2007|p=206}}\n\nAccording to Philo's ''Embassy to Gaius'' (''Embassy to Gaius'' 38), Pilate offended against [[Halakha|Jewish law]] by bringing golden shields into Jerusalem, and placing them on [[Herod's Palace (Jerusalem)|Herod's Palace]]. The sons of [[Herod the Great]] petitioned him to remove the shields, but Pilate refused. Herod's sons then threatened to petition the emperor, an action which Pilate feared that would expose the crimes he had committed in office. He did not prevent their petition. Tiberius received the petition and angrily reprimanded Pilate, ordering him to remove the shields.{{sfn|Yonge|1855|pp=165\u2013166}} Helen Bond, Daniel Schwartz, and [[Warren Carter]] argue that Philo's portrayal is largely stereotyped and rhetorical, portraying Pilate with the same words as other opponents of Jewish law, while portraying Tiberius as just and supportive of Jewish law.{{sfnm|1a1=Bond|1y=1998|1pp=36\u201337|2a1=Carter|2y=2003|2pp=15\u201316|3a1=Schwartz|3y=1992|3p=399}} It is unclear why the shields offended against Jewish law: it is likely that they contained an inscription referring to Tiberius as {{lang|la|divi Augusti filius|italics=yes}} (son of divine Augustus).{{sfn|Bond|1998|p=39}}{{sfn|Demandt|2012|pp=51\u201352}} Bond dates the incident to 31 CE, sometime after Sejanus's death in October 17.{{sfn|Bond|1998|p=46}}\n\nIn another incident recorded in both the ''Jewish Wars'' (2.9.4) and the ''Antiquities of the Jews'' (18.3.2), Josephus relates that Pilate offended the Jews by using up the [[temple treasury]] ({{lang|grc|korbanos|italics=yes}}) to pay for a new aqueduct to Jerusalem. When a mob formed while Pilate was visiting Jerusalem, Pilate ordered his troops to beat them with clubs; many perished from the blows or from being trampled by horses, and the mob was dispersed.{{sfn|Bond|1998|p=53}} The dating of the incident is unknown, but Bond argues that it must have occurred between 26 and 30 or 33 CE, based on Josephus's chronology.{{sfn|Bond|1998|p=89}}\n\nThe Gospel of Luke mentions in passing Galileans \"whose blood Pilate had mingled with their sacrifices\" ([[Luke 13]]:1).

In Bond's view, the reference to \"sacrifices\" likely means that this incident occurred at [[Passover]] at some unknown date.{{sfn|Bond|1998|pp=195\u2013196}} She argues that \"[i]t is not only possible but quite likely that Pilate's governorship contained many such brief outbreaks of trouble about which we know nothing.

[...] Legendary or theological additions have also been made to the narrative [...] Despite extensive differences, however, there is a certain agreement amongst the evangelists regarding the basic facts, an agreement which may well go beyond literary dependency and reflect actual historical events.{{sfn|Bond|1998|pp=196\u2013167}}</blockquote>\nPilate's role in condemning Jesus to death is also attested by the Roman historian [[Tacitus on Christ|Tacitus]], who, when explaining [[Nero]]'s persecution of the Christians, explains: \"Christus, the founder of the name, had undergone the death penalty in the reign of Tiberius, by sentence of the procurator Pontius Pilate, and the pernicious [[superstition]] was checked for a moment...\" (Tacitus, ''Annals'' 15.44).{{sfn|Carter|2003|p=12}}{{sfn|Bond|1998|p=xi}} The authenticity of this passage has been disputed, and it is possible that Tacitus received this information from Christian informants.{{sfn|Ash|2018|p=194}} Josephus appears also [[Josephus on Jesus|to have mentioned Jesus]]'s execution by Pilate at the request of prominent Jews (''Antiquities of the Jews'' 18.3.3). However, the original text has been greatly altered by later [[Christian interpolation]], so that it is impossible to know what Josephus may have originally said.{{sfn|Bond|1998|p=67, 71}} Discussing the paucity of extra-biblical mentions of the crucifixion, Alexander Demandt argues that the execution of Jesus was probably not seen as a particularly important event by the Romans, as many other people were crucified at the time and forgotten.{{sfn|Demandt|2012|pp=44\u201345}}\n\nBond argues that Jesus's arrest was made with Pilate's prior knowledge and involvement, based on the presence of a 500-strong Roman cohort among the party that arrests Jesus in John 18.3.{{sfn|Bond|1998|p=197}} Demandt dismisses the notion that Pilate was involved.{{sfn|Demandt|2012|pp=70-71}} It is generally assumed, based on the unanimous testimony of the gospels, that the crime for which Jesus was brought to Pilate and executed was sedition, founded on his claim to be [[Kings of Israel and Judah|king of the Jews]].{{sfnm|1a1=Bond|1y=1998|1pp=197\u2013198|2a1=L\u00e9monon|2y=2007|2p=172|3a1=Demandt|3y=2012|3p=74}} Pilate may have judged Jesus according to the ''[[Roman litigation#Cognitio|cognitio]]'' {{lang|la|extra ordinem|italics=yes}}, a form of trial for [[capital punishment]] used in the Roman provinces and applied to [[Roman citizenship|non-Roman citizens]] that provided the prefect with greater flexibility in handling the case.{{sfn|Bond|1998|p=198}}{{sfn|L\u00e9monon|2007|pp=172\u2013173}} All four gospels also mention that Pilate had the custom of releasing one captive in honor of the [[Passover]] festival; this custom is not attested in any other source. Historians disagree on whether or not such a custom is a fictional element of the gospels, reflects historical reality, or perhaps represents a single [[amnesty]] in the year of Jesus's crucifixion.{{sfnm|1a1=Bond|1y=1998|1pp=199|2a1=L\u00e9monon|2y=2007|2pp=173\u2013176|3a1=Demandt|3y=2012|3pp=75\u201376}}\n\n[[File:Munkacsy - Christ in front of Pilate.jpg|thumb|left|''Christ before Pilate'', [[Mih\u00e1ly Munk\u00e1csy]], 1881]]\nThe Gospels' portrayal of Pilate is \"widely assumed\" to diverge greatly from that found in Josephus and Philo,{{sfn|McGing|1991|p=417}} as Pilate is portrayed as reluctant to execute Jesus and pressured to do so by the crowd and Jewish authorities. John P. Meier notes that in Josephus, by contrast, \"Pilate alone [...] is said to condemn Jesus to the cross.\"{{sfn|Meier|1990|p=95}} Some scholars believe that the Gospel accounts are completely untrustworthy: S. G. F. Brandon argued that in reality, rather than vacilating on condemning Jesus, Pilate unhesitatingly executed him as a rebel.{{sfn|McGing|1991|pp=417\u2013418}} Paul Winter explained the discrepancy between Pilate in other sources and Pilate in the gospels by arguing that Christians became more and more eager to portray Pontius Pilate as a witness to Jesus' innocence, as persecution of Christians by the Roman authorities increased.{{sfn|Winter|1974|pp=85\u201386}} [[Bart Ehrman]] argues that the earliest Gospel, Mark, shows the Jews and Pilate to be in agreement about executing Jesus (Mark 15:15), while the later gospels progressively reduce Pilate's culpability, culminating in Pilate allowing the Jews to crucify Jesus in John (John 18:16). He connects this change to increased \"anti-Judaism.\"{{sfn|Ehrman|2003|pp=20-21}} Others have tried to explain Pilate's behavior in the Gospels as motivated by a change of circumstances from that shown in Josephus and Philo, usually presupposing a connection between Pilate's caution and the death of Sejanus.{{sfn|McGing|1991|p=417}} Yet other scholars, such as Brian McGing and Bond, have argued that there is no real discrepancy between Pilate's behavior in Josephus and Philo and that in the Gospels.{{sfn|Bond|1998|p=201}}{{sfn|McGing|1991|pp=435\u2013436}} Warren Carter argues that Pilate is portrayed as skillful, competent, and manipulative of the crowd in Mark, Matthew, and John, only finding Jesus innocent and executing him under pressure in Luke.{{sfn|Carter|2003|pp=153\u2013154}}\n\n===Removal and later life===\nAccording to Josephus' ''Antiquities of the Jews'' (18.4.1-2), Pilate's removal as governor occurred after Pilate slaughtered a group of armed [[Samaritans]] at a village called Tirathana near [[Mount Gerizim]], where they hoped to find artifacts that had been buried there by [[Moses]]. Alexander Demandt suggests that the leader of this movement may have been [[Dositheos (Samaritan)|Dositheos]], a [[messiah]]-like figure among the Samaritans who was known to have been active around this time.{{sfn|Demandt|2012|p=63}} The Samaritans, claiming not to have been armed, complained to [[Lucius Vitellius the Elder]], the [[List of Roman governors of Syria|governor of Syria]] (term 35-39), who had Pilate recalled to Rome to be judged by Tiberius. Tiberius however, had died before his arrival.{{sfn|Bond|1998|p=67}} This dates the end of Pilate's governorship to 36/37 CE. Tiberius died in [[Misenum]] on 16 March AD&nbsp;37, in his seventy-eighth year (Tacitus, ''Annals'' [[wikisource:The Annals (Tacitus)/Book 6#50|VI.50]], [[wikisource:The Annals (Tacitus)/Book 6#51|VI.51]]).<ref>Karen Cokayne, Experiencing Old Age In Ancient Rome, p.100</ref>\n\nFollowing Tiberius's death, Pilate's hearing would have been handled by the new emperor [[Gaius Caligula]]: it is unclear whether any hearing took place, as new emperors often dismissed outstanding legal matters from previous reigns.{{sfn|Maier|1971|pp=366\u2013367}} The only sure outcome of Pilate's return to Rome is that he was not reinstated as governor of Judaea, either because the hearing went badly, or because Pilate did not wish to return.{{sfn|Maier|1971|p=367}} J. P. L\u00e9monon argues that the fact that Pilate was not reinstated by Caligula does not mean that his trial went badly, but may simply have been because after ten years in the position it was time for him to take a new posting.{{sfn|Bond|1998|pp=92\u201393}} Joan Taylor, on the other hand, argues that Pilate seems to have ended his career in disgrace, using his unflattering portrayal in Philo, written only a few years after his dismissal, as proof.{{sfn|Taylor|2006|p=577}}\n\n[[File:A remorseful Pilate prepares to kill himself.

The second-century pagan philosopher [[Celsus]] polemically asked why, if Jesus was God, God had not punished Pilate, indicating that he did not believe that Pilate shamefully committed suicide. Responding to Celsus, the Christian apologist [[Origen]], writing c. 248 CE, argued that nothing bad happened to Pilate, because the Jews and not Pilate were responsible for Jesus' death; he therefore also assumed that Pilate did not die a shameful death.{{sfn|Maier|1971|p=370}}{{sfn|Gr\u00fcll|2010|p=154\u2013155}} Pilate's supposed suicide is also left unmentioned in Josephus, Philo, or Tacitus.{{sfn|Maier|1971|p=370}} Maier argues that \"[i]n all probability, then, the fate of Pontius Pilate lay clearly in the direction of a retired government official, a pensioned Roman ex-magistrate, than in anything more disastrous.\"{{sfn|Maier|1971|p=371}} Taylor notes that Philo discusses Pilate as though he were already dead in the ''Embassy to Gaius'', although he is writing only a few years after Pilate's tenure as governor.{{sfn|Taylor|2006|p=578}}\n\n==Archaeology and minted coins==\n[[File:Pilate Inscription.JPG|thumb|The so-called [[Pilate Stone]].

The king reads in the stars that he will bear a son who will rule over many lands, so he has a miller's daughter named Pila brought to him whom he impregnates; Pilate's name thus results from the combination of the names ''Pila'' with ''Atus''. A few years later, Pilate is brought to his father's court where he kills his half-brother. As a result, he is sent as a hostage to Rome, where he kills another hostage. As punishment he is sent to the island of Pontius, whose inhabitants he subjugates, thus acquiring the name Pontius Pilate. King Herod hears of this accomplishment and asks him to come to Palestine to aid his rule there; Pilate comes but soon usurps Herod's power.{{sfn|Martin|1973|pp=101\u2013102}} The trial and judgment of Jesus then happens as in the gospels. The emperor in Rome is suffering from a terrible disease at this time, and hearing of Christ's healing powers, sends for him only to learn from [[Saint Veronica]] that Christ has been crucified, but she possesses a cloth with the image of his face. Pilate is taken as a prisoner with her to Rome to be judged, but every time the emperor sees Pilate to condemn him, his anger dissipates. This is revealed to be because Pilate is wearing Jesus's coat; when the coat is removed, the Emperor condemns him to death, but Pilate commits suicide first. The body is first thrown in the Tiber, but because it causes storms it is then moved to Vienne, and then thrown in a lake in the high Alps.{{sfn|Martin|1973|pp=102\u2013103}}\n\nOne important version of the Pilate legend is found in the ''[[Golden Legend]]'' by [[Jacobus de Voragine]] (1263\u20131273), one of the most popular books of the later Middle Ages.{{sfn|Martin|1973|p=109}} In the ''Golden Legend'', Pilate is portrayed as closely associated with [[Judas]], first coveting the fruit in the orchard of Judas's father Ruben, then granting Judas Ruben's property after Judas has killed his own father.{{sfn|Hourihane|2009|p=234}}\n\nSeveral places in Western Europe have traditions associated with Pilate. The cities of [[Lyon]] and [[Vienne]] in modern France claim to be Pilate's birthplace: Vienne has a ''Maison de Pilate'', a ''Pr\u00e9toire de Pilate'' and a ''Tour de Pilate''.{{sfn|Demandt|2012|p=104}} One tradition states the Pilate was banished to Vienne where a Roman ruin is associated with his tomb; according to another, Pilate took refuge in a mountain (now called [[Mount Pilatus]]) in modern Switzerland, before eventually committing suicide in a lake on its summit.{{sfn|Gr\u00fcll|2010|p=164}} This connection to Mount Pilatus is attested from 1273 onwards, while [[Lake Lucerne]] has been called \"Pilatus-See\" (Pilate Lake) beginning in the fourteenth century.{{sfn|Demandt|2012|pp=104\u2013105}} A number of traditions also connected Pilate to Germany. In addition to Mainz, [[Bamberg]], [[Hausen, Upper Franconia]] were also claimed to be his place of birth, while some traditions place his death in the [[Saarland]].{{sfn|Demandt|2012|pp=105\u2013106}} The town of [[Tarragona]] in modern Spain possesses a first-century Roman tower, which, since the eighteenth-century, has been called the \"Torre del Pilatos,\" in which Pilate is claimed to have spent his last years.{{sfn|Gr\u00fcll|2010|p=164}} The tradition may go back to a misread Latin inscription on the tower.{{sfn|Gr\u00fcll|2010|p=165}} The cities of [[Huesca]] and [[Seville]] are other cities in Spain associated with Pilate.{{sfn|Demandt|2012|p=104}} Per a local legend,<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/pontius-pilates-scottish-roots-a-joke-rk0qms770t6 |title=Pontius Pilate's Scottish roots 'a joke' |newspaper=The Times |first=Mark |last=Macaskill |date=2010-01-03 |url-access=limited |access-date=2020-01-17 }}</ref> the village of [[Fortingall]] in Scotland claims to be Pilate's birthplace, but this is almost certainly a 19th century invention&nbsp;\u2013 particularly as the Romans did not invade the British Isles until 43 CE.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.scotsman.com/news-2-15012/mystery-of-the-5-000-year-old-yew-of-fortingall-1-4292618 |newspaper=The Scotsman |title=Mystery of the '5,000-year-old' yew of Fortingall |first=Alison |last=Campsie |date=2016-11-17 |access-date=2020-01-17 }}</ref>\n\nPilate also continued to be the subject of legends in Eastern Christianity. The Byzantine chronicler [[George Kedrenos]] (c. 1100) wrote that Pilate was condemned by Caligula to die by being left in the sun closed inside the skin of a freshly slaughtered cow together with a chicken, a snake, and a monkey.{{sfn|Demandt|2012|pp=102\u2013103}} In a legend from medieval [[Rus' (region)|Rus']], Pilate attempts in vain to save [[Saint Stephen]] from being executed; Pilate, his wife and children have themselves baptized and bury Stephen in a gilded silver coffin. He then builds a church in the honor of Stephen, Gamaliel, and Nicodemus, who were martyred with Stephen, before he dies seven months later.{{sfn|Demandt|2012|p=106}} In the medieval [[Slavonic Josephus]], an [[Old Church Slavonic]] translation of Josephus with legendary additions, Pilate kills many of Jesus's followers but finds Jesus innocent.

He eventually becomes a Christian himself.{{sfn|Hourihane|2009|pp=366\u2013367}} In the 1493 {{lang|de|Frankfurter Passionsspiel|italics=yes}}, on the other hand, Pilate himself accuses Christ.{{sfn|Hourihane|2009|pp=367\u2013368}} The fifteenth-century German Benediktbeuern passion play depicts Pilate as a good friend of Herod's, kissing him in a reminiscence of the kiss of Judas.{{sfn|Hourihane|2009|p=252}} Colum Hourihane argues that all of these plays supported antisemitic tropes and were written at times when persecution of Jews on the continent were high.{{sfn|Hourihane|2009|pp=368\u2013369}}\n\nThe fifteenth-century Roman {{lang|it|Passione|italics=yes}} depicts Pilate as trying to save Jesus against the wishes of the Jews.{{sfn|Hourihane|2009|p=364}} In the Italian passion plays, Pilate never identifies himself as a Jew, condemning them in the fifteenth-century {{lang|it|Resurrezione|italics=yes}} and stressing the Jews' fear of the \"new law\" of Christ.{{sfn|Hourihane|2009|pp=364\u2013365}}\n\nHourihane argues that in England, where the Jews had been expelled in 1290, Pilate's characterization may have been used primarily to satyrize corrupt officials and judges rather than to stoke antisemitism.{{sfn|Hourihane|2009|p=265}} In several English plays, Pilate is portrayed speaking French or Latin, the languages of the ruling classes and the law.{{sfn|Wroe|1999|pp=177\u2013178}} In the Wakefield plays, Pilate is portrayed as wickedly evil, describing himself as Satan's agent ({{lang|la|mali actoris|italics=yes}}) while plotting Christ's torture so as to extract the most pain. He nonetheless washes his hands of guilt after the tortures have been administered.{{sfn|Hourihane|2009|p=286}} Yet many scholars believe the motif of the conniving devil and the Jews to be inextricably linked. By the thirteenth century, medieval arts and literature had a well-established tradition of the Jew as the Devil in disguise. <ref name=\":0\" /> Thus, some scholars believe that Anti-Judaism still lies near the heart of the matter.<ref name=\":0\" /> In the fifteenth-century English Townley Cycle, Pilate is portrayed as a pompous lord and prince of the Jews, but also as forcing Christ's torturer to give him Christ's clothes at the foot of the cross.{{sfn|Hourihane|2009|p=243}} It is he alone who wishes to kill Christ rather than the high priests, conspiring together with Judas.{{sfn|Hourihane|2009|p=297, 328}} In the fifteenth-century English York passion play, Pilate judges Jesus together with [[Annas]] and [[Caiaphas]], becoming a central character of the passion narrative who converses with and instructs other characters.{{sfn|Hourihane|2009|pp=243\u2013245}} In this play, when Judas comes back to Pilate and the priests to tell them he no longer wishes to betray Jesus, Pilate browbeats Judas into going through with the plan.{{sfn|Wroe|1999|pp=213\u2013214}} Not only does Pilate force Judas to betray Christ, he double-crosses him and refuses to take him on as a servant once Judas has done so. Moreover, Pilate also swindles his way into possession of the [[Potter's field]], thus owning the land on which Judas commits suicide.{{sfn|Hourihane|2009|p=328}} In the York passion cycle, Pilate describes himself as a courtier, but in most English passion plays he proclaims his royal ancestry.{{sfn|Hourihane|2009|p=297}} The actor who portrayed Pilate in the English plays would typically speak loudly and authoritatively, a fact which was parodied in [[Geoffrey Chaucer]]'s ''[[Canterbury Tales]]''.{{sfn|Hourihane|2009|p=352}}\n\nThe fifteenth century also sees Pilate as a character in plays based on legendary material: one, {{Lang|fr|La Vengeance de Nostre-Seigneur|italics=yes}}, exists in two dramatic treatments focusing on the horrible fates that befell Christ's tormenters: it portrays Pilate being tied to a pillar, covered with oil and honey, and then slowly dismembered over 21 days; he is carefully tended to so that he does not die until the end.{{sfn|Hourihane|2009|p=317}} Another play focusing on Pilate's death is Cornish and based on the {{lang|la|Mors Pilati|italics=yes}}.{{sfn|Hourihane|2009|p=318}} The {{lang|fr|Myst\u00e8re de la Passion d'Angers|italics=yes}} by [[Jean Michel (poet)|Jean Michel]] includes legendary scenes of Pilate's life before the passion.{{sfn|Hourihane|2009|p=365}}\n\n===Modern literature===\nPontius Pilate appears as a character in a large number of literary works, typically as a character in the judgment of Christ.{{sfn|MacAdam|2001|p=90}} One of the earliest literary works in which he plays a large role is French writer [[Anatole France]]'s 1892 short story {{lang|fr|\"Le Procurateur de Jud\u00e9e\"|italics=no}} (\"The Procurator of Judaea\"), which portrays an elderly Pilate who has been banished to [[Sicily]]. There he lives happily as a farmer and is looked after by his daughter, but suffers from gout and obesity and broods over his time as governor of Judaea.{{sfn|Wroe|1999|p=358}} Spending his time at the baths of [[Baiae]], Pilate is unable to remember Jesus at all.{{sfn|Demandt|2012|p=107}}\n\nPilate makes a brief appearance in the preface to [[George Bernard Shaw]]'s 1933 play ''[[On the Rocks: A Political Comedy|On the Rocks]]'' where he argues against Jesus about the dangers of revolution and of new ideas.{{sfn|Wroe|1999|p=195}} Shortly afterwards, French writer [[Roger Caillois]] wrote a novel ''Pontius Pilate'' (1936), in which Pilate acquits Jesus.{{sfn|MacAdam|2017|p=133}}\n\nPilate features prominently in Russian author [[Mikhail Bulgakov]]'s novel ''[[The Master and Margarita]]'', which was written in the 1930s but only published in 1966, twenty six years after the author's death.{{sfn|Langenhorst|1995|p=90}} Henry I. MacAdam describes it as \"the 'cult classic' of Pilate-related fiction.\"{{sfn|MacAdam|2017|p=133}} The work features a novel within the novel about Pontius Pilate and his encounter with Jesus by an author only called the Master. Because of this subject matter, the Master has been attacked for \"Pilatism\" by the Soviet literary establishment. Five chapters of the novel are featured as chapters of ''The Master and Margarita''. In them, Pilate is portrayed as wishing to save Jesus, being affected by his charisma, but as too cowardly to do so. Russian critics in the 1960s interpreted this Pilate as \"a model of the spineless provincial bureaucrats of Stalinist Russia.\"{{sfn|Wroe|1999|p=273}} Pilate becomes obsessed with his guilt for having killed Jesus.{{sfn|Ziolkowski|1992|p=165}} Because he betrayed his desire to follow his morality and free Jesus, Pilate must suffer for eternity.{{sfn|Bond|1998|p=xiii}} Pilate's burden of guilt is finally lifted by the Master when he encounters him at the end of Bulgakov's novel.{{sfn|Wroe|1999|p=371}}\n\nThe majority of literary texts about Pilate come from the time after the Second World War, a fact which Alexander Demandt suggests shows a cultural dissatisfaction with Pilate having washed his hands of guilt.{{sfn|Demandt|2012|p=107}} One of Swiss writer [[Friedrich D\u00fcrrenmatt]]'s earliest stories (\"Pilatus,\" 1949) portrays Pilate as aware that he is torturing God in the trial of Jesus.{{sfn|Demandt|2012|p=108}} Swiss playwright [[Max Frisch]]'s comedy {{lang|de|Die chinesische Mauer|italics=yes}} portrays Pilate as a skeptical intellectual who refuses to take responsibility for the suffering he has caused.{{sfn|Demandt|2012|pp=107\u2013109}} The German Catholic novelist [[Gertrud von Le Fort]]'s {{lang|de|Die Frau des Pilatus|italics=yes}} portrays Pilate's wife as converting to Christianity after attempting to save Jesus and assuming Pilate's guilt for herself; Pilate executes her as well.{{sfn|Demandt|2012|p=108}}\n\nIn 1986, Soviet-Kyrgiz writer [[Chingiz Aitmatov]] published a novel in Russian featuring Pilate titled {{lang|ru|Placha|italics=yes}} (''The Place of the Skull''). The novel centers on an extended dialogue between Pilate and Jesus witnessed in a vision by the narrator Avdii Kallistratov, a former seminarian. Pilate is presented as an materialist pessimist who believes mankind will soon destroy itself, whereas Jesus offers a message of hope.{{sfn|Langenhorst|1995|p=90}} Among other topics, the two anachronistically discuss the meaning of the last judgment and the second coming; Pilate fails to comprehend Jesus's teachings and is complacent as he sends him to his death.{{sfn|Ziolkowski|1992|pp=167\u2013168}}\n\n===Film===\nPilate has been depicted in a number of films, being included in portrayals of Christ's passion already in some of the earliest films produced.{{sfn|McDonough|2009|p=278-2280}} In the 1927 silent film ''[[The King of Kings (1927 film)|The King of Kings]]'', Pilate is played by Hungarian-American actor [[Victor Varconi]], who is introduced seated under an enormous 37 feet high [[Aquila (Roman)|Roman eagle]], which Christopher McDonough argues symbolizes \"not power that he possesses but power that possesses him\".{{sfn|McDonough|2009|p=283}} During the ''Ecce homo'' scene, the eagle stands in the background between Jesus and Pilate, with a wing above each figure; after hesitantly condemning Jesus, Pilate passes back to the eagle, which is now framed beside him, showing his isolation in his decision and, McDonough suggests, causing the audience to question how well he has served the emperor.{{sfn|McDonough|2009|pp=284-285}}\n\nThe film ''[[The Last Days of Pompeii (1935 film)|The Last Days of Pompeii]]'' (1935) portrays Pilate as \"a representative of the gross materialism of the Roman empire\", with the actor [[Basil Rathbone]] giving him long fingers and a long nose.{{sfn|Wroe|1999|pp=38\u201339}} Following the Second World War, Pilate and the Romans often take on a villainous role in American film.{{sfn|Winkler|1998|p=167}} The 1953 film ''[[The Robe (film)|The Robe]]'' portrays Pilate as completely covered with gold and rings as a sign of Roman decadence.{{sfn|Wroe|1999|p=39}} The 1959 film ''[[Ben-Hur (1959 film)|Ben-Hur]]'' shows Pilate presiding over a chariot race, in a scene that Ann Wroe says \"seemed closely modeled on the Hitler footage of the [[1936 Summer Olympics|1936 Olympics]],\" with Pilate bored and sneering.{{sfn|Wroe|1999|p=186}} Martin Winkler, however, argues that ''Ben-Hur'' provides a more nuanced and less condemnatory portrayal of Pilate and the Roman Empire than most American films of the period.{{sfn|Winkler|1998|p=192}}\n\n[[File:Ponzio Pilato 1962 Marais.png|thumb|Jean Marais as Pontius Pilate in {{lang|it|Ponzio Pilato|italics=yes}} (1962)]]\nOnly one film has been made entirely in Pilate's perspective, the 1962 French-Italian ''[[Ponzio Pilato]]'', where Pilate was played by [[Jean Marais]].{{sfn|Wroe|1999|p=39}} In the 1973 film [[Jesus Christ Superstar (film)|''Jesus Christ Superstar'']], the trial of Jesus takes place in the ruins of a Roman theater, suggesting the collapse of Roman authority and \"the collapse of all authority, political or otherwise\".{{sfn|McDonough|2009|p=287}} The Pilate in the film, played by [[Barry Dennen]], expands on [[John 18:38]] to question Jesus on the truth and appears, in McDonough's view, as \"an anxious representative of [...] moral relativism\".{{sfn|McDonough|2009|p=287}} Speaking of Dennen's portrayal in the trial scene, McDonough describes him as a \"cornered animal.\"{{sfn|McDonough|2009|p=290}} Wroe argues that later Pilates took on a sort of effeminancy,{{sfn|Wroe|1999|p=39}} illustrated by the Pilate in ''[[Monty Python's Life of Brian]]'', where Pilate lisps and mispronounces his r's as w's. In [[Martin Scorsese]]'s ''[[The Last Temptation of Christ (film)|The Last Temptation of Christ]]'' (1988), Pilate is played by [[David Bowie]], who appears as \"gaunt and eerily hermaphrodite.\"{{sfn|Wroe|1999|p=39}} Bowie's Pilate speaks with a British accent, contrasting with the American accent of Jesus ([[Willem Dafoe]]).{{sfn|McDonough|2009|pp=290-291}} The trial takes place in Pilate's private stables, implying that Pilate does not think the judgment of Jesus very important, and no attempt is made to take any responsibility from Pilate for Jesus's death, which he orders without any qualms.{{sfn|McDonough|2009|pp=291-293}}\n\n[[Mel Gibson]]'s 2004 film ''[[The Passion of the Christ]]'' portrays Pilate, played by [[Hristo Shopov]], as a sympathetic, noble-minded character,{{sfn|Grace|2004|p=16}} fearful that the Jewish priest Caiaphas will start an uprising if he does not give in to his demands. He expresses disgust at the Jewish authorities' treatment of Jesus when Jesus is brought before him and offers Jesus a drink of water.{{sfn|Grace|2004|p=16}} McDonough argues that \"Shopov gives US a very subtle Pilate, one who manages to appear alarmed though not panicked before the crowd, but who betrays far greater misgivings in private conversation with his wife.\"{{sfn|McDonough|2009|p=295}}\n\n==Legacy==\nPontius Pilate is mentioned as having been involved in the crucifixion in both the [[Nicene Creed]] and the [[Apostles Creed]]. The Apostles Creed states that Jesus \"suffered under Pontius Pilate, was crucified, died, and was buried.\"<ref>{{cite web|title=The Apostles' Creed|url=https://www.cardinalnewman.com.au/images/stories/downloads/The%20Apostles%20Creed.pdf|publisher=Cardinal Newman Catechist Consultants|access-date=15 July 2019|date=2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190302101028/http://cardinalnewman.com.au/images/stories/downloads/The%20Apostles%20Creed.pdf|archive-date=2 March 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> The Nicene Creed states \"For our sake [Jesus] was crucified under Pontius Pilate; he suffered death and was buried.\"<ref>[[s:Nicene Creed (ECUSA Book of Common Prayer)|Nicene Creed in English]]</ref> These creeds are recited weekly by many Christians.{{sfn|Carter|2003|p=1}} Pilate is the only person besides Jesus and [[Mary, Mother of Jesus|Mary]] mentioned by name in the creeds.{{sfn|Hourihane|2009|p=391}} The mention of Pilate in the creeds serves to mark the passion as a historical event.{{sfn|Bayes|2010|p=78}}\n\nHe is venerated as a saint by the [[Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church|Ethiopian Church]] with a feast day on June 19,{{sfn|Gr\u00fcll|2010|p=167}}{{sfn|Carter|2003|p=11}} and by the [[Coptic Church]], with a feast day of June 25.{{sfn|Hourihane|2009|p=4}}\n\nPilate's washing his hands of responsibility for Jesus's death in Matthew 27:24 is a commonly encountered image in the popular imagination,{{sfn|Bond|1998|p=xi}} and is the origin of the English phrase [[Wiktionary:wash one's hands of|\"to wash one's hands of (the matter)\"]], meaning to refuse further involvement with or responsibility for something.{{sfn|Martin|2019}} Parts of the dialogue attributed to Pilate in the [[Gospel of John]] have become particularly famous sayings, especially quoted in the Latin version of the [[Vulgate]].{{Sfn|MacAdam|2017|p=139}} These include {{bibleverse|John|18:35|KJV}} ({{Lang|la|numquid ego Iudaeus sum?|italics=yes}} \"Am I a Jew?\"), [[John 18:38]] ({{Lang|la|Quid est veritas?|italics=yes}}; \"what is truth?\"), [[John 19#Verse 5|John 19:5]] ({{Lang|la|[[Ecce homo]]|italics=yes}}, \"Behold the man!\"), {{bibleverse|John|19:14|KJV}} ({{lang|la|Ecce rex vester|italics=yes}}, \"Behold your king!\"), and {{bibleverse|John|19:22|KJV}} ({{lang|la|[[Quod scripsi, scripsi]]|italics=yes}}, \"What I have written, I have written\").{{Sfn|MacAdam|2017|p=139}}\n\nThe Gospels' deflection of responsibility for Jesus's crucifixion from Pilate to the Jews has been blamed for fomenting [[antisemitism]] from the Middle Ages through the nineteenth and twentieth centuries.{{sfn|Wroe|1999|pp=331\u2013332}}\n\n===Scholarly assessments===\nThe main ancient sources on Pilate offer very different views on his governorship and personality. Philo is hostile, Josephus mostly neutral, and the Gospels \"comparatively friendly.\"{{sfn|McGing|1991|pp=415\u2013416}} This, combined with the general lack of information on Pilate's long time in office, has resulted in a wide range of assessments by modern scholars.{{sfn|Carter|2003|pp=12\u201319}}\n\nOn the basis of the many offenses that Pilate caused to the Judaean populace, some scholars find Pilate to have been a particularly bad governor. M. P. Charlesworth argues that Pilate was \"a man whose character and capacity fell below those of the ordinary provincial official [...] in ten years he had piled blunder on blunder in his scorn for and misunderstanding of the people he was sent to rule.\"{{sfn|Maier|1971|p=363}} However, Paul Maier argues that Pilate's long term as governor of Judaea indicates he must have been a reasonably competent administrator,{{sfn|Maier|1971|p=365}} while Henry MacAdam argues that \"[a]mong the Judaean governors prior to the Jewish War, Pilate must be ranked as more capable than most.\"{{sfn|MacAdam|2001|p=77}} Other scholars have argued that Pilate was simply culturally insensitive in his interactions with the Jews and in this way a typical Roman official.{{sfn|Carter|2003|pp=5\u20136}}\n\nBeginning with E. Stauffer in 1948, scholars have argued, on the basis of his possible appointment by [[Sejanus]], that Pilate's offenses against the Jews were directed by Sejanus out of hatred of the Jews and a desire to destroy their nation, a theory supported by the pagan imagery on Pilate's coins.{{sfn|Maier|1968|pp=9\u201310}} According to this theory, following Sejanus's execution in 31 CE and Tiberius's purges of his supporters, Pilate, fearful of being removed himself, became far more cautious, explaining his apparently weak and vaciliating attitude at the trial of Jesus.{{sfn|Maier|1968|pp=10\u201311}} Helen Bond argues that \"[g]iven the history of pagan designs throughout Judaean coinage, particularly from Herod and Gratus, Pilate's coins do not seem to be deliberately offensive,\"{{sfn|Bond|1998|p=21}} and that the coins offer little evidence of any connection between Pilate and Sejanus.{{sfn|Bond|1998|p=22}} Carter notes this theory arose in the context of the aftermath of the [[Holocaust]], that the evidence that Sejanus was anti-Semitic depends entirely on Philo, and that \"[m]ost scholars have not been convinced that it is an accurate or a fair picture of Pilate.\"{{sfn|Carter|2003|p=4}}\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of biblical figures identified in extra-biblical sources]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{notelist}}\n\n==Citations==\n{{Reflist|20em}}\n\n== References ==\n{{refbegin|30em}}\n* {{cite journal| last1=Amora-Stark |first1=Shua |display-authors=etal |title= An Inscribed Copper-Alloy Finger Ring from Herodium Depicting a Krater |journal=Israel Exploration Journal |volume= 68 |issue=2 |year=2018 |pages=208\u2013220|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/329307909 |ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book |editor-last=Ash |editor-first=Rhiannon |title=Tacitus Annals.

He was inducted into the [[WWE Hall of Fame]] class of [[WWE Hall of Fame (2013)|2013]].\n\nFoley has wrestled under his real name and various personas. His main persona during his time in WCW and ECW from 1991 to 1996 was '''Cactus Jack''', a bloodthirsty and uncompromisingly physical brawler from [[Truth or Consequences, New Mexico]] who wore cowboy boots and often wrestled with sharp and/or solid metallic objects, such as barbed wire, thumbtacks, or metal trashcans. When Foley got to the WWF in 1996, he debuted the persona known as '''Mankind''', a masked, mentally deranged loner who stuffed a smelly gym sock in his opponents' mouths and spent his spare time dwelling in boiler rooms; and later Foley debuted '''Dude Love''', a relaxed, fun-loving, jive-talking, tie-dyed shirt-wearing hippie. These personas were known as the \"Three Faces of Foley\", and Cactus Jack made his debut in the WWF in 1997. He is a four-time [[Professional wrestling championship#World championships|world champion]] (three [[WWE Championship|WWF Championships]] and one [[TNA World Heavyweight Championship]]), an 11-time [[World tag team championship|world tag team champion]] (eight [[World Tag Team Championship (WWE)|WWF Tag Team Championships]], two [[ECW World Tag Team Championship]]s and one [[WCW World Tag Team Championship]]), a one-time [[TNA King of the Mountain Championship|TNA Legends Champion]], and the inaugural [[WWE Hardcore Championship|WWF Hardcore Champion]]. Foley's dedicated and physical style of wrestling led him to often participate in violent and brutal matches that involved him taking dangerous bumps and putting his body through a considerable physical toll, and would sometimes cause him or his opponents to bleed copiously, earning him the moniker \"The Hardcore Legend\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.wwe.com/classics/classic-lists/mick-foleys-12-wildest-matches|title=Dirty dozen: Mick Foley's 12 wildest ngmatches|website=WWE.com}}</ref>\n\n== Early life ==\nMichael Francis Foley<ref name=\"IGN\">{{cite web|url=http://stars.ign.com/objects/142/14208780_biography.html|title=Mick Foley Biography|accessdate=May 20, 2008 |publisher=[[IGN]]|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080904210033/http://stars.ign.com/objects/142/14208780_biography.html|archivedate=September 4, 2008}}</ref><ref name=\"OWOW\">{{cite web|url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/profiles/m/mick-foley.html|title=Mick Foley's profile|accessdate=April 14, 2008|publisher=Online World of Wrestling}}</ref> was born in [[Bloomington, Indiana]],<ref name=\"IGN\"/> on June 7, 1965.<ref name=\"OWOW\"/><ref name=\"IGN\"/> He is of Irish descent,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.pscp.tv/JOEdotie/1zqJVRoaBMDJB?t=120|title=JOE.ie @JOEdotie|first=Twitter|last=Inc|website=Periscope}}</ref> and has an older brother named John. Shortly after his birth, he moved with his family to the [[Long Island]] town of [[Setauket-East Setauket, New York|East Setauket, New York]] about 40 miles east of [[New York City]], where he attended [[Ward Melville High School]]. At school, he [[Scholastic wrestling|wrestled]] and played [[lacrosse]],<ref name=\"IGN\"/><ref>Foley, ''Have A Nice Day!'', pp. 11\u201312, 19</ref> and was a classmate and wrestling teammate of actor [[Kevin James]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hobotrashcan.com/interviews/mickfoley3.php|title=One on One with Mick Foley (2007)|first=Joel|last= Murphy|publisher=HoboTrashcan.com| accessdate=March 30, 2007|date=March 2007}}</ref> While a student at [[State University of New York at Cortland]], Foley hitchhiked to [[Madison Square Garden]] to see his favorite wrestler, [[Jimmy Snuka]], in a steel cage match against [[Don Muraco]].<ref name=WWEProfileMickFoley>{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/superstars/wwealumni/mickfoley|title=Mick Foley |publisher=WWE Alumni profile, [[World Wrestling Entertainment]]|accessdate=October 1, 2010}}</ref><ref name=mf34/> He has said that Snuka's flying body splash from the top of the cage inspired him to pursue a career in pro wrestling.<ref name=WWEProfileMickFoley/><ref name=mf34>Foley, ''Have A Nice Day!'', pp. 33\u201334</ref> He had a seat close to the front row and is visible on the video of the event.<ref name=mf34/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://s271.photobucket.com/user/jklmn_2008/media/FoleyMSG.jpg.html|title=Photo by Alec Settee|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n== Professional wrestling career ==\n=== Training and early career (1983\u20131991) ===\n[[File:Mick Foley.jpg|thumb|upright|Foley as Cactus Jack]]\nMick Foley formally trained at [[Dominic DeNucci]]'s wrestling school in [[Freedom, Pennsylvania]], driving several hours weekly from his college campus in [[Cortland, New York]], and debuted in 1983.<ref name=\"HAND\"/><ref>{{cite web|last1=Foley|first1=Mick|title=Mick Foley - 30 YEARS AGO TODAY: MY FIRST MATCH EVER...|url=https://www.facebook.com/RealMickFoley/photos/a.150133228350157.28288.126269440736536/1326472897382845/?type=3&permPage=1|website=facebook.com|accessdate=July 6, 2016}}</ref> In addition to appearing on DeNucci's cards, Foley and several other students also took part in some [[glossary of professional wrestling terms#squash|squash]] matches as [[Job (professional wrestling)#jobbers|jobbers]] for [[WWE|WWF]] TV tapings of ''[[Prime Time Wrestling]]'' and ''[[WWF Superstars of Wrestling|Superstars of Wrestling]]'', where Foley wrestled under the names Jack Foley and Nick Foley. In one of these matches (the very first episode of Superstars), Foley and [[Les Thornton]] (another jobber) faced the [[British Bulldogs]], during which the [[Dynamite Kid]] (who had a long earned reputation as a [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#stiff|stiff]] worker in the ring) clotheslined Foley with such force that he was unable to eat solid food for several weeks.<ref>Foley, ''Have A Nice Day!'', pp. 82\u201385</ref> During these squash matches, Foley also faced other top-level talent at the time, such as [[Hercules (wrestler)|Hercules Hernandez]]. His run would not last long, as he had not signed a contract with the promotion at the time. During this run, he was also billed from different hometowns and at different weights.\n\nAfter several years of wrestling in the [[independent circuit]], Foley began receiving offers from various regional promotions, including [[Bill Watts]]' [[Universal Wrestling Federation (Bill Watts)|Universal Wrestling Federation]] (UWF).<ref>Foley, ''Have A Nice Day!'', pp. 91\u201393</ref> He joined the [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]]-based [[Continental Wrestling Association]] (CWA) as Cactus Jack Manson, where he teamed with Gary Young as part of the [[Stud Stable]].<ref>Foley, ''Have A Nice Day!'', p. 117</ref> Cactus and Young briefly held the CWA tag titles in late 1988.<ref name=SlamFoleyBio>{{cite web|last=Milner|first=John|url=http://slam.canoe.ca/Slam/Wrestling/Bios/foley.html|title=Mick Foley Profile|publisher=SLAM! Wrestling|accessdate=March 20, 2006|date=November 18, 2004}}</ref> On November 20, Foley left CWA for Texas-based [[World Class Championship Wrestling]].\n\nIn [[World Class Championship Wrestling]] (WCCW), Cactus Jack, billed as Cactus Jack Manson, was a major part of [[Skandor Akbar]]'s stable. (The addition of \"Manson\" to Foley's name, due to its implied connection to [[Charles Manson]], made him uncomfortable.)<ref>Foley, ''Have A Nice Day!'', p. 131, 146</ref> Foley also won several titles, including the company's light heavyweight and tag team titles before leaving the company, losing his last match to [[Eric Embry]] in nine seconds. He then briefly competed in Alabama's Continental Wrestling Federation before completing a brief stint with [[World Championship Wrestling]]. For much of his time there, he would team with jobbers.  When the jobber would lose the match for the team, Cactus Jack would attack his partner, throw them out of the ring, and deliver his infamous ring apron flying elbow drop onto the concrete floor. One notable occasion he did this was in [[Gainesville, Georgia]] against the rising tag team of brothers [[Rick Steiner|Rick]] and [[Scott Steiner]]- two of the stiffest workers in wrestling at the time. Cactus was partnered with a one-time jobber named Rick Fargo, and after taking brutal bumps from both Steiner brothers and losing the match, Cactus then began fighting with Fargo, and then jumped nearly 12 feet off the apron to elbow Fargo in the abdomen, per Kevin Sullivan\u2019s instructions. Lead WCW booker [[Ric Flair]], Sullivan and other WCW executives were impressed with this to the point that they offered Foley a contract, and Foley finally found some financial stability after years of hardship. His biggest match at the time was a few weeks later against [[Mil M\u00e1scaras]] at ''[[Clash of the Champions X: Texas Shootout]]'', where he took a particularly brutal bump backwards off the 3-foot high apron and landed on the concrete floor, with his head and back taking the impact.<ref>Foley, ''Have A Nice Day!'', p. 169</ref> It was during this period that Foley was involved in a car accident that resulted in the loss of his two front teeth, adding to the distinctive look for which he is famous.<ref>Foley, ''Have A Nice Day!'', pp. 164\u2013166</ref> Following the short stint with WCW, Foley then signed with [[Herb Abrams]]'s [[Universal Wrestling Federation (Herb Abrams)|Universal Wrestling Federation]].<ref name=SlamFoleyBio/><ref>Foley, ''Have A Nice Day!'', p. 183</ref> In UWF, Foley teamed with [[Bob Orton, Jr.|Bob Orton]] to feud with [[Don Muraco]], [[Sunny Beach (wrestler)|Sunny Beach]], and [[Brian Blair]].\n\nHe soon left UWF for [[Professional wrestling promotion|Tri-State Wrestling]] (a forerunner to [[Extreme Championship Wrestling]]),<ref>Foley, ''Have A Nice Day!'', p. 192</ref> whose high-impact and violent wrestling style fit Foley well. On one night, known as Tri-State's Summer Sizzler 1991, Cactus Jack and [[Eddie Gilbert (wrestler)|Eddie Gilbert]] had three matches in one night: Cactus won a [[Professional wrestling match types#Falls Count Anywhere match|Falls Count Anywhere match]], lost a [[Professional wrestling match types#Container-based variations|Stretcher match]], and then fought to a double [[Professional wrestling#Disqualification|disqualification]] in a [[Professional wrestling match types#steel Cage match|Steel Cage match]].<ref name=mf194>Foley, ''Have A Nice Day!'', pp. 194\u2013195</ref> These matches caught the attention of [[World Championship Wrestling]] promoters, in large part due to widespread photo circulation. In 1991, after a brief stint working in the [[Global Wrestling Federation]], Foley joined WCW full-time.<ref name=SlamFoleyBio/><ref name=mf194/>\n\n=== World Championship Wrestling===\n==== Early years (1991\u20131993) ====\nOn September 5, 1991, Cactus Jack debuted as a [[Heel (professional wrestling)|heel]] and attacked [[Sting (wrestler)|Sting]].<ref>Foley, ''Have A Nice Day!'', p. 201</ref> After feuds with [[Van Hammer]] and [[Abdullah the Butcher]], Cactus Jack faced Sting, then WCW World Heavyweight Champion, in a non-title Falls Count Anywhere match at [[Beach Blast (1992)|Beach Blast]] in 1992, which Sting won.<ref name=mf223>Foley, ''Have A Nice Day!'', p. 223</ref> For a long time, Foley considered this the best match he ever worked.<ref name=mf223/> Unlike Jack's first stint in WCW, where his personality was quieter, he was now outwardly maniacal; laughing hysterically, shrieking into the air while choking his opponents and yelling his signature catchphrase \"Bang-Bang!\".\n\nAfter spending a year and a half with WCW as a heel, Cactus Jack transitioned into a fan favorite after engaging in a feud with Paul Orndorff, Harley Race and Big Van Vader. Jack and Orndorff wrestled each other in a match for a spot on WCW World Heavyweight Champion Vader's team at ''[[Clash of the Champions XXII]]''. After the match, Race and Orndorff beat up Jack. At the following Clash of Champions event, Cactus Jack helped Sting's team win the match. He engaged in a feud with Orndorff, winning a falls-count-anywhere match against Orndorff at [[SuperBrawl III]]. He then moved on to face Big Van Vader.\n\n==== Feud with Vader (1993\u20131994) ====\nCactus Jack wrestled [[Big Van Vader]] on April 6, 1993, winning by count-out, but being severely beaten in the process. As a result, in the rematch with Vader on April 24, the two executed a dangerous spot to sell a storyline injury. Harley Race removed the protective mats at ringside and Vader [[powerbomb]]ed Cactus onto the exposed concrete floor, causing a legitimate concussion and causing Foley to temporarily lose sensation in his left foot.<ref>Foley, ''Have A Nice Day!'', pp. 243\u2013244</ref> While Foley was away, WCW ran an [[glossary of professional wrestling terms#Angle|angle]] where Cactus Jack's absence was explained with a [[Farce|farcical]] comedy storyline in which he went crazy, was institutionalized, escaped, and developed amnesia.<ref name=mf248>Foley, ''Have A Nice Day!'', pp. 248\u2013250</ref> Foley had wanted the injury storyline to be very serious and generate genuine sympathy for him before his return. The comedy [[glossary of professional wrestling terms#Vignette|vignettes]] that WCW produced instead were so bad that Foley jokes in ''Have a Nice Day'' that they were the brainchild of WCW executives who regarded a surefire moneymaking feud as a problem that needed to be solved. The angle was awarded \"Most Disgusting Promotional Tactic\" by the esteemed [[Dave Meltzer|Wrestling Newsletter Observer]].<ref name=mf248/>\n\nIn one of WCW's most brutal matches of all time, Cactus faced Vader in a [[professional wrestling match types#Last Man Standing match|Texas Death match]] at [[Halloween Havoc (1993)|Halloween Havoc]].<ref>Foley, ''Have A Nice Day!'', p. 256</ref> Race won the match for Vader by using a stun gun on Cactus, knocking him out. The level of violence involved in this feud caused WCW to refuse to book Cactus Jack against Vader on a pay-per-view again. On March 16, 1994, during a WCW European tour, Foley and Big Van Vader had one of the most infamous matches in wrestling history in [[Munich]], Germany. Foley began a hangman\u2014a planned move where a wrestler's head is tangled between the top two ring ropes. Neither wrestler was aware that the ring ropes had been drawn extra tight before the event, and Foley was barely able to move. When Foley finally freed himself from the ropes and fell out of the ring, his ears were badly split at the back. When Foley re-entered the ring the two wrestlers began trading blows. During this time, Vader reached up and grabbed Foley's right ear, and ripped it off. The two men continued wrestling as the referee picked up the ear and gave it to the ring announcer. Vader claimed for years after that the ear had come off during the botched Hangman maneuver, however in a WWE Network video, Vader admits that after seeing footage that he had indeed removed Foley's ear. Cactus Jack and [[Kevin Sullivan (wrestler)|Kevin Sullivan]] were scheduled to win the tag team titles at [[Slamboree (1994)|Slamboree]] in 1994.<ref>Foley, ''Have A Nice Day!'', p. 272</ref> Foley had to choose between reattaching his ear or wrestling in the pay-per-view and winning the titles. Foley chose to wrestle and won his only championship in WCW. Later on, Foley was frustrated by WCW and the company\u2019s new head [[Eric Bischoff]]\u2019s reluctance to work a storyline with Vader around losing his ear.\n\nWCW also shared a brief co-promotion with ECW during this time in which Foley represented WCW on ECW television as the WCW Tag Team champion, facing [[Sabu (wrestler)|Sabu]] at [[Hostile City Showdown]] on June 24, 1994. During a promo, Foley spat on his Tag Team title belt and threw it to the ground to appeal to the hardcore fans who frowned upon the mainstream promotions.\n\n=== NWA Eastern/Extreme Championship Wrestling (1994\u20131996) ===\nCactus Jack's first appearance for the NWA-affiliated [[Eastern Championship Wrestling]] came on the May 31, 1994 episode, with Cactus revealed as Sabu's opponent for June 24 at the ECW Arena in Philadelphia. After being part of a talent exchange between ECW & WCW, Foley brought his WCW tag team title belt and spit on it for a recorded ECW tv segment. Foley continued with ECW and began a feud with [[Sabu (wrestler)|Sabu]]. Foley then began working the ECW tag team division on teams with [[Terry Funk]], [[Mikey Whipwreck]], and [[Kevin Sullivan (wrestler)|Kevin Sullivan]]. He had two [[ECW World Tag Team Championship]] reigns with Whipwreck while in ECW.<ref name=ECWtag>{{cite web|url=http://www.wrestling-titles.com/us/ecw/ecw-t.html|title=ECW World Tag Team Title history with his son alex foley|publisher=Wrestling-titles.com}}</ref>\n\nAfter the stints in Smokey Mountain Wrestling and Japan noted below, Foley then returned to ECW to have a series of violent encounters with the Sandman, while challenging him and claiming that he had never been beaten in a falls count anywhere match. He then started to team with [[Tommy Dreamer]]. According to Heyman, Hardcore style differentiated Foley from other traditional wrestlers, so in ECW, Foley was right at home. After seeing a sign in the audience one night that said \"Cane Dewey\" a reference to Foley's real-life son, Foley began a [[gimmick (professional wrestling)|gimmick]] where he criticized hardcore wrestling and sought to renounce his status as a hardcore wrestling icon and used a very technical, slow wrestling as a way to punish the audience.<ref name=\"MondayNightWars\" >{{cite DVD|title=Monday Night War S01 E05:Have a Nice Day!|publisher=WWE|}}</ref> He said that he was on a mission to save his partner from making the mistake of trying to please bloodthirsty fans. The mismatched partnership lasted until August 5, 1995, when Cactus turned on Dreamer when they were teaming with [[The Pitbulls]] against Raven, [[Stevie Richards]] and [[The Dudley Brothers]] ([[Dudley Dudley (wrestler)|Dudley Dudley]] and [[Big Dick Dudley]]).  Cactus Jack DDT'ed his partner and joined Raven's Nest, as he wished to serve [[Raven (wrestler)|Raven]]'s \"higher purpose\". He remained one of Raven's top henchmen for the remainder of his time in ECW. On August 28, Cactus beat the previously undefeated [[911 (wrestler)|911]]. As part of Foley's heel [[gimmick (professional wrestling)|gimmick]], he began praising WWF and WCW on ECW television, which angered ECW fans. Their anger intensified once word began to spread that Foley was leaving to join the WWF (In ''Have a Nice Day'', Foley recounted an incident where he asked an ECW roadie to sell T-shirts for him at an event held in a Queens, New York venue where he had been popular even as a heel; the man came back after being spat upon numerous times by angry fans, who made him fear for his life<ref>Foley, ''Have A Nice Day!'', '''p.??'''</ref>). Even when he tried to give sincere good-byes to the fans, Cactus Jack was met with chants of \"You sold out\" by the ECW fanbase everywhere he went. Cactus was booked to face WWF hater [[Shane Douglas]], who won after he handcuffed Cactus and then hit him with no less than '''''ten''''' consecutive plastic chair shots and when he put Jack into a [[Professional wrestling holds#Figure four leglock|figure four leglock]], this allowed Mikey Whipwreck to get into the arena and land one last very hard chair shot to Cactus's face, knocking him unconscious. Foley's last ECW match was against Whipwreck on March 9, 1996, and he recounts that he was not looking forward to it due to the increasingly hostile reactions he got even when he wasn't in character. The ECW fans, who knew that this was Foley's last match, finally returned his affection. They cheered him throughout the match and chanted, \"Please don't go!\". After the match, Foley told the audience that their reaction made everything worthwhile and made his exit by dancing with [[Stevie Richards]] and [[The Blue Meanie]] to [[Frank Sinatra]]'s song \"[[Theme from New York, New York|New York, New York]]\". Foley has said that this exit was his favorite moment in wrestling.<ref name=SlamFoleyBio/><ref>Mick Foley, ''Mick Foley's Greatest Hits and Misses: A Life in Wrestling''</ref>\n\n=== Smoky Mountain Wrestling and Japan (1994\u20131996)===\nAt the tail end of 1994, Foley joined [[Smoky Mountain Wrestling]] (SMW) as Cactus Jack, causing [[Balls Mahoney|Boo Bradley]] to lose the [[SMW Beat the Champ Television Championship]]. He often teamed with [[Brian Lee (wrestler)|Brian Lee]] to feud with Bradley and [[Chris Candido]]. Cactus Jack then began a crusade to rid Bradley of his valet [[Tammy Lynn Sytch|Tamara Fytch]]. He ignited a feud between Candido and Bradley when he accused Candido of having sexual relations with Fytch. (Ironically, Candido and Fytch were a couple in real life). Cactus Jack left SMW before the feud was resolved.\n\nIn 1995, Foley went to Japan and wrestled in [[International Wrestling Association of Japan]] (IWA Japan), where he engaged in feuds with Terry Funk and Shoji Nakamaki. During his brief stint in Japan Foley had the nickname \"Tsunami Stopper.\" Foley, however, soon returned to ECW to feud with [[The Sandman (wrestler)|The Sandman]]. Funk returned to team up with Sandman, and during a particularly violent spot, the pair hit Cactus with a [[Shinai|kendo stick]] forty-six times in a barbed wire rope match. Cactus Jack then defeated Funk at Hostile City Showdown 1995. Later, he fought Sandman for the ECW championship. During the match, Cactus Jack knocked Sandman unconscious and was declared the winner. Referee [[Bill Alfonso]], however, reversed his decision because the title cannot change hands by knockout.\n\nReturning to the IWA, Cactus Jack began a feud with [[Michael Kirchner|Leatherface]], whom he had betrayed during a tag team match. Foley also continued to wrestle in independent circuits, winning championships on the Ozark Mountain and [[Steel City Wrestling|Steel City]] circuits. On August 20, 1995, IWA organized a [[IWA Kawasaki Dream#1995 King of the Death Match Tournament|King of the Death Match]] tournament at their [[IWA Kawasaki Dream|Kawasaki Dream]] event, which featured some of the bloodiest, most violent and most brutal matches of Foley's career. Each level of the tournament featured a new and deadly [[gimmick (professional wrestling)|gimmick]]: Cactus Jack's first-round during the day was a barbed-wire baseball bat, thumbtack deathmatch, in which he defeated Terry Gordy; the second round was a barbed-wire board, bed of nails match where Cactus Jack defeated Shoji Nakamaki. The final, at night against Terry Funk, was a barbed-wire rope, barbed-wire and [[C-4 (explosive)|C4]] board, time-bomb deathmatch, which Cactus Jack won with help from [[Tiger Jeet Singh]]. After the match, both men were covered in blood, ravaged by flesh cuts from the wire and burned by the C4 explosions. Foley later said that he only received $300 for the entire night,<ref>''Mick Foley's Greatest Hits and Misses: A Life in Wrestling'' DVD</ref> but in 2010 he wrote that, \"looking back that match in Honjo is probably the performance I'm proudest of.\"<ref name=\"Slate\" /> After the tournament, Foley's right arm had second-degree burns from the C-4 explosions from the match with Funk and his arm smelt of explosive chemicals. After a 14-hour flight from [[Tokyo]]'s [[Narita Airport]] to [[JFK Airport]] his father picked him up from the airport to take him back to his Long Island home, and immediately smelt something unusual. When Foley got home, his father and wife kept asking him about the awful smell, but he would not say anything, not wanting them to worry. After his father left, his wife persisted, so he revealed the burns to her. Later on, he teamed with [[Tracy Smothers]] for a quick run with the IWA tag team titles.\n\n=== World Wrestling Federation/WWF===\n==== Three faces of Foley (1996\u20131998) ====\nIn 1996, at the persistence of [[Jim Ross]], whom Foley had known in his days in WCW, WWF head [[Vince McMahon]] brought on Foley, and he signed a contract with WWF and this time, the WWF did not use Foley as \"[[Job (professional wrestling)|enhancement talent]]\". McMahon was not a fan of Cactus Jack and wanted to cover up Foley's face, so he was shown several designs for a new heel character- a man with a leather mask and chains, called '''Mason the Mutilator'''. However, WWF decided that it was too dark and only left the mask, and although interested in the concept of the character, Foley did not like the name, so he came up with the name '''Mankind''', which company head [[Vince McMahon]] liked and approved.<ref name=\"FoleyDVD\">{{cite AV media|date=May 3, 2013|title=Mick Foley: For All Mankind|medium=DVD|publisher=[[WWE Home Video]]}}</ref> Foley arrived in the WWF in 1996 debuting a [[gimmick (professional wrestling)|gimmick]] that was perhaps his most famous personality: Mankind was a mentally deranged schizophrenic who constantly squealed (even throughout his matches), shrieked ''\"Mommy!\"'', spoke to a rat named George, enjoyed pain, physically abused himself (such as by pulling out his hair) and wore a mask; Mankind's finishing move was the [[professional wrestling hold#mandible claw|Mandible Claw]] nerve hold, which involved sticking his ring and middle fingers in his opponent's mouth. His catchphrase was \"Have a nice day!\" and he lived in [[Mechanical room|boiler rooms]]; hence, his specialty match, the [[Professional wrestling match types#Boiler Room Brawl|Boiler Room Brawl]].<ref name=\"IGN\"/> This specific match was a chaotic, dangerous and sometimes violent match that took place inside an arena's mechanical/boiler room, with all sorts of exposed metal piping with large bolts, concrete flooring and solid electrical equipment everywhere, and it was a no disqualification match, so foreign objects were allowed, and the match's objective was to escape the boiler room first.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://wrestlingnews.co/columns/who-really-gets-credit-for-creating-the-boiler-room-brawl/ |title = Who really gets credit for creating the Boiler Room Brawl?|date = August 15, 2017 |accessdate=March 30, 2020}}</ref>\n\nOn the April 1, 1996, episode of ''[[WWE Raw|Monday Night Raw]]'' in [[San Bernardino, California]], the day after [[WrestleMania XII]], Mankind debuted on TV and defeated [[Hardcore Holly|Bob \u201cSpark Plug\u201d Holly]], quickly moving into a feud with [[The Undertaker]]. The creatively inclined and dedicated Foley initially would prepare for playing Mankind by researching the character, often spending the night in the respective arena's boiler room and sometimes under the wrestling ring for the first few months, but after that he could get into character almost instantly. The two then began interfering in the other's matches until they were booked in the first-ever Boiler Room Brawl, and in addition to escaping the arena's boiler room, the combatant also had to reach the ring and take the urn from Paul Bearer. After 30 minutes of brawling in the boiler room, the backstage corridors and the entrance ramp, and both men taking some bumps involving metal trash cans, tables, ladders, metal poles, hot coffee and the exposed concrete floor, The Undertaker appeared to have won, but Paul Bearer refused to hand him the urn, allowing Mankind to win, thus (for the time being) ending the relationship between Paul and The Undertaker. While Mankind was managed by Paul Bearer, he referred to him as \"Uncle Paul\". Mankind then became the number one contender to face the then WWF Champion [[Shawn Michaels]] at [[In Your House 10: Mind Games|In Your House: Mind Games]]. Michaels won by disqualification via interference by [[Big Van Vader|Vader]] and The Undertaker.\n\nThe Mankind and Undertaker rivalry continued with the first-ever [[Professional wrestling match types#Buried Alive match|Buried Alive match]] at [[In Your House 11: Buried Alive|In Your House: Buried Alive]]. Undertaker won the match, but Paul Bearer, the [[Terry Gordy|Executioner]], Mankind and other heels attacked The Undertaker and buried him alive. Afterward, The Undertaker challenged Mankind to a match at [[Survivor Series (1996)|Survivor Series]], which the Undertaker won. The feud continued after another match at [[In Your House 14: Revenge of the 'Taker|In Your House: Revenge of the Taker]] for the WWF World Heavyweight Championship, which Undertaker had won at [[WrestleMania 13]]. Undertaker won the match and Bearer took a leave of absence, continuing the feud. [[Jim Ross]] then began conducting a series of interviews with Mankind. During the interviews, Ross brought up the topic of Foley's home videos and the hippie-inspired character he played in them, Dude Love, as well as his tormented journey in wrestling. The interviews also affected the fans, who began cheering Mankind, turning him into a face.\n\nAround this time, [[Stone Cold Steve Austin]] and Shawn Michaels won the WWF Tag Team Championships from [[Owen Hart]] and [[Davey Boy Smith|The British Bulldog]], but Michaels was injured and could no longer compete. Mankind tried to replace him, but Austin said he wanted \"nothing to do with a freak\" and resigned himself to facing Hart and the Bulldog alone the next week. Halfway into the match, however, Foley debuted a new persona known as Dude Love, who helped Austin take the victory, becoming the new Tag Team Champions.<ref name=\"Worldtag\">{{cite web|url=http://www.wrestling-titles.com/wwe/wwf-t.html|title=WWWF/WWF/WWE World Tag Team Title history|publisher=Wrestling-titles.com}}</ref> Austin and Foley vacated their tag team titles when Austin suffered a neck injury in a match at [[SummerSlam (1997)|SummerSlam]] in [[East Rutherford, New Jersey]]. Dude Love feuded with [[Triple H|Hunter Hearst Helmsley]], as the two competed in a [[Professional wrestling match types#Falls Count Anywhere match|Falls Count Anywhere match]]. One of Foley's most memorable vignettes aired before the match began, in which Dude Love and Mankind discussed who should wrestle the upcoming match. Eventually, \"they\" decided that it should be Cactus Jack, and Foley's old character made his WWF debut. Cactus Jack won the match with a [[Piledriver (professional wrestling)|piledriver]] through a table. Shortly thereafter, ECW's [[Terry Funk]] joined the WWF as Chainsaw Charlie. At the [[Royal Rumble (1998)|1998 Royal Rumble]], Foley participated under all three personas, Cactus Jack (1st entry), Mankind (16th), and Dude Love (28th). Charlie and Jack defeated [[the New Age Outlaws]] at [[WrestleMania XIV]] in a [[Professional wrestling match types#dumpster match|Dumpster match]] to win the tag team titles (which was originally supposed to be a barbed-wire rope match- but this very often violent and bloody match was scrapped due to the high profile appearance of [[Mike Tyson]] taking part at the event). The next night, however, [[Vince McMahon]] stripped them of the belts and scheduled a rematch in a steel cage, which the Outlaws won with help from their new allies, [[D-Generation X]]. On April 6, 1998, Foley turned heel when Cactus Jack explained the fans would not see him anymore because they did not appreciate him and only cared about Stone Cold Steve Austin. [[Vince McMahon]] explained to Austin the next week that he would face a \"mystery\" opponent at [[Unforgiven: In Your House|Unforgiven]]. That opponent turned out to be Dude Love, who won the match by disqualification, meaning that Austin retained the title. McMahon, displeased with the outcome, required Foley to prove he deserved another shot at Austin's title with a number one contenders match against his former partner, Terry Funk. The match was both the WWF's first-ever \"[[Hardcore wrestling|Hardcore match]]\" and the first time that Foley wrestled under his name. Foley won, and after the match, a proud McMahon came out to Dude Love's music and presented Foley with the Dude Love costume. At [[Over the Edge: In Your House|Over the Edge]], Dude Love took on Austin for the title. McMahon designated his subordinates [[Gerald Brisco]] and [[Pat Patterson (wrestler)|Pat Patterson]] as the timekeeper and ring announcer, and made himself the special referee. The Undertaker, however, came to ringside to ensure McMahon called the match fairly, and with his presence, Dude Love lost the match and was \"fired\" by McMahon on the June 1 episode of ''Raw''.\n\nOn that same episode of ''Raw'', Foley reverted to his Mankind character, who began wearing an untucked shirt with a loose necktie and resumed his feud with The Undertaker. At [[King of the Ring (1998)|King of the Ring]] in Pittsburgh\u2019s [[Civic Arena (Pittsburgh)|Civic Arena]] on June 28, the two performed in the [[the Undertaker vs. Mankind|third]] [[Hell in a Cell match]], which became one of most notable matches in professional wrestling history. Foley received numerous injuries and took two dangerous and highly influential [[Bump (professional wrestling)|bumps]]- the first being tossed off the top of the 16 foot high Cell by The Undertaker, crashing through the wooden Spanish announcer's table and landing on the arena's concrete floor. Barely five minutes after the first bump Foley, with a separated shoulder climbed back up to the top of the Cell after Terry Funk and others tried to stop him, and the second bump, which was an unplanned botch- The Undertaker Chokeslammed Foley, and the fenced panel Foley landed on broke and gave way, so Foley fell 13 feet and landed on the ring mat. Mankind lost the match to conclude their storyline.\n\n==== WWF Champion (1998\u20132000) ====\n{{main|The Rock 'n' Sock Connection}}\nAlthough conventional wisdom holds that the Hell in a Cell match was responsible for Foley's rise to main event status, live television crowds did not initially get behind Mankind because of the match.{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}} Following a couple of months of teaming with [[Kane (wrestler)|Kane]] who together won the WWF Tag Team Championship on two separate occasions and various feuds with Kane, Stone Cold Steve Austin and The Undertaker, Foley decided that crowds might respond better if Mankind were more of a comedy character, and so he abandoned the tortured soul characteristics and became more of a goofy, broken down oaf. He began the transition into this character following [[SummerSlam (1998)|SummerSlam]] in 1998 after Kane turned on him and the two lost the tag team championships.\n\nThe following month, Foley began an angle with Vince McMahon, with Mankind trying to be a friend to the hated Mr. McMahon. On the October 5 episode of ''Raw'', while McMahon was in a hospital nursing wounds suffered at the hands of The Undertaker and Kane, Mankind arrived with a female clown called Yurple in an attempt to cheer him up. Having succeeded only in irritating McMahon, Mankind then took a sock off his foot to create a sock puppet named '''\"Mr. Socko\"'''. Intended to be a one-time joke, Socko became an overnight sensation. Mankind began putting the sock on his hand before applying his finisher, the [[professional wrestling hold#mandible claw|Mandible Claw]], stuffing a smelly sock in the mouths of opposing wrestlers. The sweat sock became massively popular with the fans, mainly because it was marketed (mostly by [[Jerry Lawler|Jerry \"The King\" Lawler]] during the events) as being a dirty, smelly, sweaty, repulsive, and vile sock. McMahon manipulated Mankind, who saw the WWF owner as a father figure, into doing his bidding. McMahon created the [[WWE Hardcore Championship|Hardcore Championship]] and awarded it to Mankind, making him the first-ever champion of the hardcore division. Mankind was then pushed as the favorite to win the [[WWE World Championship|WWF Championship]] at [[Survivor Series (1998)|Survivor Series]], as McMahon appeared to be manipulating the tournament so that Mankind would win. He and [[Dwayne Johnson|The Rock]] both reached the finals, where McMahon turned on Mankind. As The Rock placed Mankind in the [[Sharpshooter (professional wrestling)|Sharpshooter]], McMahon ordered the timekeeper to ring the bell even though Mankind did not submit, a reference to the [[Montreal Screwjob]] from the year before. As a result of Survivor Series, Mankind officially turned face, while The Rock turned heel and became the crown jewel in McMahon's new [[The Corporation (professional wrestling)|Corporation]] faction.\n\nAfter weeks of trying to get his hands on McMahon's new faction, the [[The Corporation (professional wrestling)|Corporation]], Mankind received a title shot against [[Dwayne Johnson|The Rock]] at [[Rock Bottom: In Your House]]. Mankind won the match by using his mandible claw hold (with the 'Mr. Socko' prop on his hand) and the referee declared The Rock had become unresponsive. But McMahon overruled the title change because Mankind didn't keep his pre-match promise to make The Rock submit. After several weeks of going after the Corporation, Mankind defeated The Rock to win his first WWF Championship on December 29 in [[Worcester, Massachusetts]]. The taped show was broadcast on January 4, 1999, so that is the date WWE recognizes as beginning the title run. Having title changes on broadcast television rather than pay-per-view was uncommon in professional wrestling, but because of the [[Monday Night Wars#1997\u20131999: Attitude Era|Monday Night Wars]], TV ratings became more important. The head of rival promotion WCW [[Eric Bischoff]], attempting to take advantage of the fact that their show ''Monday Nitro'' aired live while Mankind's title victory was taped the week before, had announcer [[Tony Schiavone]] reveal the ending of the Mankind-Rock match before it aired. He then added sarcastically, \"That'll put a lot of butts in the seats.\" The move backfired for WCW, as [[Nielsen ratings]] showed that Raw won the ratings battle that night, despite the [[The Fingerpoke of Doom|Hulk Hogan vs. Kevin Nash main event]] which led to the reformation of the [[New World Order (professional wrestling)|New World Order]]. Foley said that the ratings indicate that large numbers of viewers switched from ''Nitro'' to ''Raw'' to see him win the title and took great personal pride from this.\n\nMankind lost the WWF Championship to The Rock in an [[\"I Quit\" match]] at [[Royal Rumble (1999)|Royal Rumble]] at the [[Arrowhead Pond]] in [[Anaheim, California]] near [[Los Angeles]], in what is regarded as one of the company's most brutal matches. During the match, Foley took several violent and dangerous bumps from [[Dwayne Johnson|The Rock]] all over the arena, including repeated steel chair shots to the head and a fall from the stands onto solid electrical objects, which sparked upon impact. Although steel chair shots to the head were commonplace in the Attitude Era, the most a wrestler would take in a single ten-minute match was two, or sometimes three, with their hands in front of their head to ease the blow and lessen a chance of a concussion- but Foley had taken '''''eleven''''' in the span of two and a half minutes- all unprotected because he had been handcuffed just before The Rock began his repeated onslaught. Foley was originally supposed to take five chair shots to the head with the final match-ending shot being two-thirds up the entrance ramp, but after the fifth shot, Foley was still at ringside, and even after Foley signaled to The Rock to hit him in the back, The Rock decided to keep to the match's brutal tone based on Foley's previous calling of similar shots on the spot, and he hit Foley six more times in the head until they got to the two-thirds mark. This match is featured in Barry Blaustein's documentary ''[[Beyond the Mat]]'', which shows the impact the match had on Foley, his family and even the rest of the audience at ringside, and at one point Foley's five-year-old daughter Noelle cried and screamed in horror, believing her father was dying as The Rock pummeled Foley with repeated chair shots. The match got to a point that people sitting in the front of the audience screamed and signalled at the referee and The Rock to stop the match.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://deadspin.com/twenty-years-ago-the-rock-beat-mick-foley-about-the-he-1832057103|title=Twenty Years Ago, The Rock Beat Mick Foley About The Head And It Was Fucked Up|accessdate=August 9, 2019 |author=David Bixenspan |url-status=live}}</ref> The match ended after Mankind lost consciousness, and The Rock's allies played a recording of Mankind saying \"I Quit\" from an earlier interview he did with Shane McMahon. \n\nMankind won the title back in a rematch on Halftime Heat, which aired during halftime of [[Super Bowl XXXIII]], in the WWF's first-ever [[Professional wrestling match types#Empty Arena match|Empty Arena match]] in [[Tucson, Arizona]] on January 31. After 20 minutes of brawling in the ring, the empty grandstands, a kitchen, the arena's hallways, an office, and the catering hall, Mankind used a [[forklift]] to pin The Rock in a basement loading area. The two then competed in a [[Professional wrestling match types|Last Man Standing match]] at [[St. Valentine's Day Massacre: In Your House|St. Valentine's Day Massacre]], which ended without a winner, meaning that Mankind retained the title. The next night, Mr. McMahon booked a ladder match for the championship, which The Rock won with help from [[Paul Wight|The Big Show]]. Mankind would go on to [[WrestleMania XV|WrestleMania]] to defeat The Big Show and again at [[Backlash (1999)|Backlash]] a month later in a violent and brutal Boiler Room Brawl (the first in the WWF since July 1996), where the objective of the match had been simplified from the 1996 match to just escape the boiler room. Shortly after Big Show would team with Mankind, Test and Shamrock to take on the Corporation at Over The Edge. Later in the year, Foley and The Rock patched up their friendship and teamed up to form a comedy team called [[the Rock 'n' Sock Connection]], becoming one of the most popular teams during that time. The pair won the tag team titles on three occasions. One notable match was a Buried Alive match that pitted the Rock \u2018n\u2019 Sock Connection against The Undertaker and The Big Show, who were out for revenge after losing the tag titles one week earlier. This match included a spot where The Big Show tossed Mankind off the stage, landing hard on the dirt and falling into the grave- Mankind traveled nearly 25 feet in total. Foley then helped ''Raw'' achieve its highest [[Nielsen ratings|ratings]] ever with a segment featuring himself (as Mankind) and The Rock. The \"This Is Your Life\" segment aired on September 27, 1999, and received an 8.4 rating, with Yurple the Clown making another appearance.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://slashwrestling.com/raw/990927.html |title=Slashwrestling Raw report \u2013 with ratings |accessdate=January 13, 2007 |author=Christopher Robin Zimmerman |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061102112807/http://slashwrestling.com/raw/990927.html |archivedate=November 2, 2006 }}</ref>\n\nIn August 1999, Foley returned after a three-month absence recovering from knee surgery to resume his feud with [[Triple H]], who had kayfabe injured Foley's left knee with his sledgehammer. On an episode of ''Raw'', Mankind drew with Triple H in a match for the number one contender for the WWF Championship, which resulted in a Triple Threat match between Steve Austin, Triple H and Mankind at [[SummerSlam (1999)|SummerSlam]] for the title. Foley won the WWF Championship for the third time at [[SummerSlam (1999)|SummerSlam]], pinning the reigning champion Austin.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://slam.canoe.ca/SlamWrestlingArchive/aug23_fol.html|last=Powell|first=John|title=Mick Foley New Champion at SummerSlam!|publisher=SLAM!

The next night on ''Raw'', Triple H defeated Mankind to win his first WWF championship. A feud then developed between Mankind and the McMahon-Helmsley regime, led by Triple H. This included Triple H defeating Mankind in another Boiler Room Brawl on the September 23 edition of ''Smackdown!'', as part of a five-match \u201cgauntlet\u201c challenge set upon Triple H by Vince McMahon.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWXn5CtCYOk&t=1s|title=Triple H vs Mankind (Boiler Room Brawl) - Sept 23, 1999|accessdate=June 30, 2019 |author=WWE}}</ref>\n\nMankind continued his feud with Triple H when he was supposed to have the last Boiler Room Brawl match with \"[[Santa Claus]]\".

Foley then reverted to his Cactus Jack persona in January 2000 and faced Triple H for the WWF Championship at [[Royal Rumble (2000)|Royal Rumble]] in a [[Hardcore wrestling|Street Fight]]. Cactus used a 2x4 wrapped in barbed wire, and thumbtacks- trademark weapons from his pre-WWF days, but Triple H won the match after delivering two pedigrees, the second slamming Cactus face-first onto a pile of tacks. This feud culminated with a rematch at [[No Way Out (2000)|No Way Out]] in a Hell in a Cell match, where stipulations held that Cactus Jack could not use foreign metallic objects he used in the Royal Rumble, and if he did not win the title, Foley had to retire from wrestling. During the match, they had made their way onto the top of the cell and Foley was preparing to Piledrive Triple H onto a barbed wire 2x4 on fire, but Triple H reversed it into a backdrop, causing the cage to give way, Foley fell through the canvas.

Foley has said that he intended for his Commissioner Foley character to be a \"role model for nerds,\" cracking lame jokes and making no attempt to appear tough or scary. He also had a knack during this time to have no one spot for his office; rather, Mick would have an office in all sorts of odd places (for example, closets). Foley turned getting [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#pop|cheap pops]] into something of a catchphrase, as he shamelessly declared at each WWF show that he was thrilled to be \"right here in (whatever city in which he was performing (e.g., New York))!\" punctuated with an intentionally cheesy thumbs-up gesture. During this time, Commissioner Foley engaged in rivalries with [[Kurt Angle]], [[Edge and Christian]], and Vince McMahon without actually wrestling them. He left the position in December 2000 after being \"fired\" onscreen by McMahon during which he received a brutal beat down.\n\nFoley made a surprise return on the ''Raw'' just before [[WrestleMania X-Seven]] and announced that he would be the [[referee (professional wrestling)#Special referee|special guest referee]] in the match between Mr. McMahon and his son Shane at WrestleMania. After WrestleMania, Foley made sporadic appearances on WWF programming throughout the middle of the year, at one point introducing Minnesota Governor [[Jesse Ventura]] during a taping of ''Raw'' in the state as a foil to Mr. McMahon, as well as serving as the guest referee for the Earl Hebner versus Nick Patrick Referee match and a tag-team bra and panties match between WWF wrestlers [[Lita (wrestler)|Lita]] & [[Trish Stratus]] vs WCW stars [[Stacy Keibler]] & [[Torrie Wilson]] at the [[WWF Invasion]] pay-per-view. Foley returned as commissioner in October 2001, near the end of [[The Invasion (professional wrestling)|The Invasion]] angle. During this brief tenure, Foley had the opportunity to [[Shoot (professional wrestling)|shoot]] on the WWF's direction and how dissatisfied he was with it. Saying that there were far too many championships in the company, he booked unification matches before the final pay-per-view of the storyline, [[Survivor Series (2001)|Survivor Series]]. After Survivor Series, he ended his commissionership at Vince McMahon's request and left the company.\n\n=== Independent circuit (2003\u20132005) ===\nDuring his absences from WWE, Foley made frequent appearances on the [[independent circuit]] from 2003 to 2005, primarily in non-wrestling roles, either as a referee, manager, or special guest.\n\nHis first independent circuit appearance was on December 12, 2003 for International Wrestling Cartel, where he was the special guest referee for a match between [[Dusty Rhodes (wrestler)|Dusty Rhodes]] and [[Jerry Lawler]].\n\nFoley did not appear on the independent circuit again until May 2004, when he appeared for the Japanese promotion [[HUSTLE]] and returned to the ring to face [[Toshiaki Kawada]] for the [[Triple Crown Heavyweight Championship]], but ended up losing.\n\nOn September 11, 2004, Foley made his debut for [[Ring of Honor]] and cut a promo, praising ROH and referring to it as \"Ring of Hardcore\", thus establishing himself as a [[Face (professional wrestling)|babyface]]. On October 3, Foley refereed a match between Jerry Lawler and [[Slyck Wagner Brown]] for the New England Wrestling promotion. On October 15, Foley returned to ROH where he confronted [[Ricky Steamboat]], who claimed that traditional wrestling was better than hardcore wrestling. The next day, both Foley and Steamboat cut promos on each other, leading to a match between two teams of wrestlers handpicked by both men, with [[Nigel McGuiness]] and [[Chad Collyer]] representing Steamboat and [[Dan Maff]] and [[B.J. Whitmer]] representing Foley, which was won by McGuiness and Collyer. On November 6, Foley teased a heel turn when he called [[ROH World Championship|ROH Champion]] [[Samoa Joe]] \"softcore\". On November 20, Foley made a surprise appearance for New York Wrestling Connection, making a run-in during [[Mikey Whipwreck]] and Ken Scampi's match against Mayhem and Tony Burma, where he helped Whipwreck and Scampi win.\n\nFoley made an appearance on the [[A Night of Appreciation for Sabu|Night of Appreciation for Sabu]], where he refereed the match between [[Shane Douglas]] and Raven, where Sabu himself interfered in the match and helped Douglas win.\n\nFoley returned to ROH on December 26 at ROH's Final Battle event and had his final confrontation with Ricky Steamboat, where the two made peace. On January 15, 2005, Foley turned heel after he was confronted by Samoa Joe and hit Joe over the head with a steel chair. One week later, Foley appeared with [[Border City Wrestling]] to referee the match between [[Alex Shelley]] and [[Chris Sabin]] for the BCW Television Championship, which Sabin won.\n\nFoley refereed the main event of the first [[WrestleReunion]] show, which saw Dusty Rhodes, [[Goldust|Dustin Rhodes]], and [[Mike Graham (wrestler)|Mike Graham]] battle [[Abdullah the Butcher]], [[Kevin Sullivan (wrestler)|Kevin Sullivan]], and [[CM Punk]].\n\nOn February 19, Foley resumed his feud with Samoa Joe in ROH, teasing a return to the ring but instead choosing [[Vordell Walker]] to fight Joe. After Joe defeated Walker, Foley introduced his \"backup plan\" New Cactus Jack to fight Joe in a second match, which Joe won as well.\n\nOn February 26, Foley appeared with Frank Goodman's USA Xtreme promotion, cutting a promo saying that there was no need to wait until June for an ECW reunion (referring to the upcoming [[Hardcore Homecoming]] show being put together by Shane Douglas), and brought out [[Axl Rotten]], Shane Douglas, [[Chris Candido]], [[Tammy Lynn Sytch|Tammy Sytch]], [[Balls Mahoney]], [[Al Snow]], [[Justin Credible]], [[The Sandman (wrestler)|The Sandman]], Terry Funk and Sabu, much to the excitement of the crowd, who began an \"E-C-Dub!\" chant. But then Raven came out and cut a promo saying that he had only ever been the one true star of ECW and everyone else had just been a [[Job (professional wrestling)|jobber]], leading to a match between Raven and Balls Mahoney later in the night, which Raven won by DQ when he threw fire in Mahoney's eyes. After this, Foley and several of the other ECW alumni came to the ring and attacked Raven.\n\nOn April 2, Foley appeared with [[Harley Race]]'s [[World League Wrestling]] to referee a match between [[William Mueller|Trevor Rhodes]] and Brandon Bishop, which was ruled a No-Contest. After the match, Rhodes, Bishop, and Johnny Gold all attacked Foley until Terry Funk and Harley Race ran in and fought the three wrestlers off. Afterwards, Foley left the arena with Funk and Race.\n\nOn April 30, Foley refereed a match at a Northeast Wrestling show between Jerry Lawler and [[King Kong Bundy]], which Lawler won.\n\nOn May 7, Foley made a return to the ring at the Mark Curtis Memorial Show, where he was victorious in a tag team match with Shane Douglas against Al Snow and [[D'Lo Brown]], which also featured [[Dominic DeNucci]] (Foley and Douglas' trainer) in his and Douglas' corner.\n\nThe main event of the ECW reunion show Hardcore Homecoming was Terry Funk against Sabu and Shane Douglas in a Triple Threat Elimination No Ropes Barbed Wire Match. During the middle of the match, [[Bill Alfonso]], who was in Sabu's corner, began pulling Shane Douglas into the wire, which led to [[Francine Fournier|Francine]], who was in Douglas' corner, attacking Alfonso. Using this as a distraction, Douglas brought a ladder into the ring when suddenly the lights in the arena went out. When they came back on, Foley was in the ring, as Cactus Jack, wearing a referee shirt. Foley pulled out a barbed-wire wrapped Mr. Socko and applied the Mandible Claw on Douglas, then DDT'd Douglas onto a steel chair. Terry Funk then crawled onto Douglas and eliminated him when Foley made the 3-count. After that, Funk targeted Sabu, throwing him into the barbed wire, then setting up a table and putting Sabu on it. Funk then climbed up the ladder, but before he got far, it collapsed from under his weight, sending him crashing through the table. Sabu then recovered, gave Funk an Arabian Facebuster off a chair, and pinned Funk to win the match. After the match ended, all four of them were greeted with chants of \"Terry!\" and \"Sabu!\" and \"Foley!\" and \"Thank You Shane!\" and of course \"E-C-Dub! E-C-Dub!\". The entire locker room emptied moments later and celebrated with Funk, Sabu, Foley, and Douglas in the ring to continued \"E-C-Dub\" chants.\n\nOn July 8, Foley returned to ROH as a face, confronting ROH Champion CM Punk, who had turned heel and mocked ROH and the championship after he had signed with WWE and threatened to take the title with him to WWE. Foley acted as a direct line to Vince McMahon, attempting to convince Punk to defend his title one last time on McMahon's orders before he departed from ROH.\n\nOn August 13, Foley made an appearance with Ballpark Brawl to make fun of [[Matthew Kaye|Matt Striker]], who had been doing an impersonation of The Rock. Later in the event, Foley refereed the Canes, Tables, and Chairs match between Sandman and Sabu, which Sandman won. After the match, Foley celebrated with Sandman by drinking beer with him in the middle of the ring.\n\nOn August 20, Foley returned to ROH again, as a face, to rescue [[Jade Chung]] from [[Prince Nana]]. Foley was then attacked from behind by Alex Shelley and [[The Embassy (professional wrestling)|The Embassy]] until [[Austin Aries]] and [[Roderick Strong]] chased them off. One week later, Foley returned to the ring for the second WrestleReunion show to team with Terry Funk and [[Dory Funk, Jr.]] in a losing effort against the [[The Midnight Express (professional wrestling)|Midnight Express]] ([[Stan Lane]], [[Bobby Eaton]], and [[Dennis Condrey]].)\n\nFoley made his final regular appearance with ROH on September 17, when he was in [[A.J. Styles]]' corner in a match against Embassy member [[Jimmy Rave]], which Styles won. Afterwards, Foley put over ROH huge saying he enjoyed being on ROH shows and would speak highly of it.\n\nFoley made his final major independent circuit appearance on the Tribute to ''Starrcade'' show on November 19 as the referee for the match between Dustin Rhodes and Terry Funk, which ended in a No-Contest.\n\n=== Return to WWE ===\n====Various feuds (2003&ndash;2006)====\nFoley returned in June 2003 to referee the [[Hell in a Cell]] match between Triple H and [[Kevin Nash]] at Bad Blood. On June 23, during a ''Raw'' broadcast in [[Madison Square Garden]], he was honored for his achievements in the ring and presented with the retired [[WWE Hardcore Championship]] belt. The evening ended with Foley taking a beating and kicked down a flight of stairs by [[Randy Orton]] and [[Ric Flair]]. In December 2003, Foley returned to replace Steve Austin as co-general manager of ''Raw''. He soon grew tired of the day-to-day travel and left his full-time duties to write and spend time with his family. In the storyline, Foley was afraid to wrestle a match with Intercontinental Champion [[Randy Orton]] on the December 15 episode of ''Raw'' and walked out of the match rather than face him, the result of the match was ruled a draw. After Foley walked backstage, Orton confronted him asking why he walked out of the match, calling him a coward in the process, before spitting in his face. Foley walked out of the arena afterwards.\n\nIn 2004, Foley returned briefly to wrestling, competing in the [[Royal Rumble]] and eliminating both Orton and himself with his trademark Cactus Jack clothesline. He and [[Dwayne Johnson|The Rock]] reunited as the Rock 'n' Sock Connection and lost a handicap match to [[Evolution (professional wrestling)|Evolution]] at [[WrestleMania XX]]. Foley and Orton continued to feud, culminating in a [[Hardcore wrestling|hardcore match]] for the [[WWE Intercontinental Championship]] at [[Backlash (2004)|Backlash]], where a thumbtack-covered Orton defeated Foley, as his Cactus Jack persona, to retain the title after hitting Foley with his signature move, the ''RKO'' onto a barbed wire covered baseball bat. Foley regards this match as possibly the best of his career.<ref>Foley, Mick. The Hardcore Diaries (p.260)</ref>\n\nFoley appeared as a color commentator at WWE's [[ECW One Night Stand (2005)|ECW One Night Stand]], which aired on June 12, 2005, and subsequently renewed his contract with WWE. Foley returned in 2005 in a match where fans were able to vote on which persona he would appear as\u2014Mankind, Dude Love, or Cactus Jack\u2014against [[Carly Col\u00f3n|Carlito]] at [[Taboo Tuesday (2005)|Taboo Tuesday]]. The fans voted for Mankind, who went on to win the match- this was the last time Foley ever wrestled as Mankind. On the February 16, 2006, ''Raw'', Foley returned to referee the WWE Championship match between [[Edge (wrestler)|Edge]] and [[John Cena]]. After Cena won, Edge attacked Foley, and the following week, Foley challenged Edge to a match at [[WrestleMania 22]]. In the intensely brutal match, the heavily bloodied and thumbtack-covered Edge defeated Foley after spearing him through a flaming table, where both performers suffered second-degree burns after anti-flame material was not applied to the flaming table, at their own request.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dt54lUPqWEk|title=Bruce Prichard shoots on Edge vs Mick Foley at Wrestlemania|accessdate=July 31, 2019|date=December 27, 2018}}</ref> In the weeks after the match, an \"impressed\" Foley turned heel and allied himself with Edge against the newly rejuvenated [[ECW (WWE brand)|ECW]]. At [[ECW One Night Stand (2006)|ECW One Night Stand]], Foley, Edge and [[Lita (wrestler)|Lita]] defeated Terry Funk, [[Tommy Dreamer]] and [[Beulah McGillicutty]] in a violent and brutal tag-team hardcore match, which included a spot where Funk hit Foley with a barbed wire 2x4 plank lit on fire, and the flame latched onto Foley, and he then fell onto a plywood board covered in more barbed wire.\n\nFoley then engaged in a storyline rivalry with [[Ric Flair]], inspired by real-life animosity between the two. In ''Have a Nice Day!'', Foley wrote that Flair was \"every bit as bad on the booking side of things as he was great on the wrestling side of it.\" In response, Flair wrote in his autobiography that Foley was \"a glorified stuntman\" and that he was able to climb the ladder in the WWF only because he was friends with the bookers. The two had a backstage confrontation at a ''Raw'' event in December 2004 in [[Huntsville]], [[Alabama]], but Foley has said that they have largely reconciled.<ref name=SlamFoleyRicFlair>{{cite web|last=Baines|first=Tim|url=http://slam.canoe.ca/Slam/Wrestling/2004/06/27/516827.html|title= Ric Flair Critical of Mick Foley in New Book|publisher=SLAM!

Tazz filled in for Foley as a color commentator on ''SmackDown'', while Raw wrestler [[Matt Striker]] filled in for Tazz on ''[[ECW (WWE)|ECW]]''. Foley told Long Island Press pro wrestling columnist Josh Stewart in August 2008 that \"creatively, the announcing job wasn't working out too well\".

Two weeks later, Foley made his full television debut in a promo making comments about the [[List of WWE personnel|WWE roster]], Vince McMahon and [[Kurt Angle]]. At [[Bound for Glory IV]], he was the special guest enforcer for Jarrett and Angle's match. Later, on ''Impact!'', Foley said goodbye, but was then approached by Jeff Jarrett with a new offer; he later indicated that they had come to terms on a new contract and would make a major announcement the next week. On the October 23 episode of ''Impact!'', Foley announced that he was now co-owner of TNA along with Jarrett, just after Kurt Angle headbutted him.\n\nOn November 27, Thanksgiving Day, TNA presented the Turkey Bowl. [[Alex Shelley]] ended up being pinned by [[Rhino (wrestler)|Rhino]], and Foley handed Rhino the check. Afterwards, the defeated Shelley had to put on a Turkey Suit in compliance with the match rules, albeit with much refusal. However, Shelley \"[[Finger (gesture)|flipped off]]\" Foley and proceeded to beat him up. In the aftermath, Mick mentioned that Shelley is lucky he still has his job. [[The Main Event Mafia]]'s [[Kevin Nash]], [[Booker T (wrestler)|Booker T]], and [[Scott Steiner]] were going to take on [[D-Von Dudley|Brother Devon]], [[A.J. Styles]], and Mick Foley in his debut matchup at [[Genesis (2009)|Genesis]]. Nash, however, suffered a legitimate staph infection and missed Genesis. He was replaced by [[Monty Sopp|Cute Kip]]. Foley got the pin when he hit Scott Steiner with a double arm DDT onto a chair.\n\nOn April 19, 2009 at [[Lockdown (2009)|Lockdown]], he defeated [[Sting (wrestler)|Sting]] to win the [[TNA World Heavyweight Championship]] for his first-ever championship in TNA, and his fourth World title overall. Mick did not lose the championship, but Sting became the new leader of the Main Event Mafia by pinning Kurt Angle at [[Sacrifice (2009)|Sacrifice]]. Foley had also stated on ''[[TNA Impact!|Impact!]]'' tapings that if he retained the TNA World Heavyweight Title at the [[King of the Mountain match]] at [[Slammiversary (2009)|Slammiversary]], he would only put the title up in a match once a year. However, he lost the title to Kurt Angle in the King of The Mountain match at Slammiversary. He received a rematch at [[Victory Road (2009)|Victory Road]], commenting he had only submitted once in his career (to Terry Funk, in a [[Professional wrestling holds#Spinning toe hold|spinning toe hold]]) and swore he'd never do it again. He lost the match when Angle forced him to submit again with the [[ankle lock]].\n\nOn July 30, 2009, the 200th episode of ''Impact!'', Foley won the [[TNA Global Championship|TNA Legends Championship]] by pinning champion Kevin Nash in a tag team match where Nash teamed with Angle and Foley with [[Bobby Lashley]]. At [[Hard Justice (2009)|Hard Justice]], Nash defeated Foley to regain the title, following interference from [[Tracy Brookshaw|Traci Brooks]].\n\n==== Various storylines (2009\u20132011) ====\nOn the edition of September 24 of ''Impact!''

In 2015, Foley appeared at [[SummerSlam (2015)|SummerSlam]], where he kicked off the event with host [[Jon Stewart]]. Foley returned to ''Raw'' on March 14, 2016 in a backstage segment with Dean Ambrose, in which he gave him a pep talk for his upcoming [[WrestleMania 32]] match against [[Brock Lesnar]] and a passing of the torch in the form of his iconic barbed wire baseball bat, \"Barbie\". On April 3, 2016 at [[WrestleMania 32]], Foley returned in-ring alongside [[Shawn Michaels]] and [[Stone Cold Steve Austin]] in a post-match interruption where the trio of Hall of Famers took on [[The League of Nations (professional wrestling)|The League of Nations]] after they had defeated [[The New Day (wrestling)|The New Day]] and proclaimed \"No three people can ever defeat us.\" Foley brought out Mr. Socko and executed the Mandible Claw two times during the fight, once on [[Sheamus]] and once on [[Wade Barrett|King Barrett]].

Foley has since unveiled new titles exclusive to the [[Raw (WWE brand)|Raw brand]], while also making fair decisions to favor the faces and occasionally disagreeing with Stephanie McMahon. One of Foley's first decisions as Raw General Manager was pitting the feuding [[Sheamus]] and [[Cesaro (wrestler)|Cesaro]] against one another in a Best of 7 series. Going into [[WWE Clash of Champions|Clash of Champions]] the duo were tied 3-3. At Clash of Champions, both men would be counted out resulting in a draw and the best of seven series being declared a draw.

On the November 21 episode of ''Raw'', Foley would place [[Sami Zayn]] in a match against [[Braun Strowman]] after Zayn failed to defeat [[The Miz]] at [[Survivor Series (2016)|Survivor Series]] for the [[WWE Intercontinental Championship]] to bring the title to ''Raw''. During the match, Foley would order the match to be stopped, deeming Zayn unable to continue. The following week on ''Raw'', Zayn would demand a rematch against Strowman, but Foley would decline, telling Zayn he could not beat him, making Zayn storm off in anger. On the December 12 episode of ''Raw'', Zayn would once again ask for a rematch with Strowman but was once again rejected by Foley. Zayn would then tell Foley he was pondering going to ''[[WWE SmackDown|SmackDown]]'' because Foley did not believe in him. Later that night, after Zayn defeated [[Jinder Mahal]], Foley would tell him he has arranged a trade with ''SmackDown'' for him in exchange for [[Eva Marie]]. Zayn would angrily refuse the trade and once again demanded a rematch with Strowman. Foley would yield, giving Zayn his match with Strowman at [[Roadblock: End of the Line]] with a ten-minute time limit.\n\nOn the March 13, 2017 episode of ''Raw'', Stephanie McMahon forced Foley to fire a member of the ''Raw'' roster by the end of the night. Foley chose to fire Stephanie McMahon herself, which prompted [[Triple H]] to come out and confront Foley. After being insulted and ordered to leave the ring, Foley instead attacked Triple H, stuffing a sock in Triple H's mouth via ''Mr. Socko'' before being low blowed by McMahon. [[Seth Rollins]] would then come out to aid Foley, only to be attacked by Triple H. On the March 20 episode of ''Raw'', Stephanie McMahon would fire Foley for his actions the previous week. A few weeks later Foley made an appearance at the WWE Hall of Fame [[WWE Hall of Fame (2017)|class of 2017]] ceremony.\n\n====Return to Raw (2018\u2013present)====\nOn the September 10, 2018 episode of ''Raw''.

He was inducted into the [[WWE Hall of Fame]] class of [[WWE Hall of Fame (2013)|2013]].\n\nFoley has wrestled under his real name and various personas. His main persona during his time in WCW and ECW from 1991 to 1996 was '''Cactus Jack''', a bloodthirsty and uncompromisingly physical brawler from [[Truth or Consequences, New Mexico]] who wore cowboy boots and often wrestled with sharp and/or solid metallic objects, such as barbed wire, thumbtacks, or metal trashcans. When Foley got to the WWF in 1996, he debuted the persona known as '''Mankind''', a masked, mentally deranged loner who stuffed a smelly gym sock in his opponents' mouths and spent his spare time dwelling in boiler rooms; and later Foley debuted '''Dude Love''', a relaxed, fun-loving, jive-talking, tie-dyed shirt-wearing hippie. These personas were known as the \"Three Faces of Foley\", and Cactus Jack made his debut in the WWF in 1997. He is a four-time [[Professional wrestling championship#World championships|world champion]] (three [[WWE Championship|WWF Championships]] and one [[TNA World Heavyweight Championship]]), an 11-time [[World tag team championship|world tag team champion]] (eight [[World Tag Team Championship (WWE)|WWF Tag Team Championships]], two [[ECW World Tag Team Championship]]s and one [[WCW World Tag Team Championship]]), a one-time [[TNA King of the Mountain Championship|TNA Legends Champion]], and the inaugural [[WWE Hardcore Championship|WWF Hardcore Champion]]. Foley's dedicated and physical style of wrestling led him to often participate in violent and brutal matches that involved him taking dangerous bumps and putting his body through a considerable physical toll, and would sometimes cause him or his opponents to bleed copiously, earning him the moniker \"The Hardcore Legend\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.wwe.com/classics/classic-lists/mick-foleys-12-wildest-matches|title=Dirty dozen: Mick Foley's 12 wildest ngmatches|website=WWE.com}}</ref>\n\n== Early life ==\nMichael Francis Foley<ref name=\"IGN\">{{cite web|url=http://stars.ign.com/objects/142/14208780_biography.html|title=Mick Foley Biography|accessdate=May 20, 2008 |publisher=[[IGN]]|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080904210033/http://stars.ign.com/objects/142/14208780_biography.html|archivedate=September 4, 2008}}</ref><ref name=\"OWOW\">{{cite web|url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/profiles/m/mick-foley.html|title=Mick Foley's profile|accessdate=April 14, 2008|publisher=Online World of Wrestling}}</ref> was born in [[Bloomington, Indiana]],<ref name=\"IGN\"/> on June 7, 1965.<ref name=\"OWOW\"/><ref name=\"IGN\"/> He is of Irish descent,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.pscp.tv/JOEdotie/1zqJVRoaBMDJB?t=120|title=JOE.ie @JOEdotie|first=Twitter|last=Inc|website=Periscope}}</ref> and has an older brother named John.

In one of these matches (the very first episode of Superstars), Foley and [[Les Thornton]] (another jobber) faced the [[British Bulldogs]], during which the [[Dynamite Kid]] (who had a long earned reputation as a [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#stiff|stiff]] worker in the ring) clotheslined Foley with such force that he was unable to eat solid food for several weeks.<ref>Foley, ''Have A Nice Day!'', pp. 82\u201385</ref> During these squash matches, Foley also faced other top-level talent at the time, such as [[Hercules (wrestler)|Hercules Hernandez]]. His run would not last long, as he had not signed a contract with the promotion at the time. During this run, he was also billed from different hometowns and at different weights.\n\nAfter several years of wrestling in the [[independent circuit]], Foley began receiving offers from various regional promotions, including [[Bill Watts]]' [[Universal Wrestling Federation (Bill Watts)|Universal Wrestling Federation]] (UWF).<ref>Foley, ''Have A Nice Day!'', pp. 91\u201393</ref> He joined the [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]]-based [[Continental Wrestling Association]] (CWA) as Cactus Jack Manson, where he teamed with Gary Young as part of the [[Stud Stable]].<ref>Foley, ''Have A Nice Day!'', p. 117</ref> Cactus and Young briefly held the CWA tag titles in late 1988.<ref name=SlamFoleyBio>{{cite web|last=Milner|first=John|url=http://slam.canoe.ca/Slam/Wrestling/Bios/foley.html|title=Mick Foley Profile|publisher=SLAM! Wrestling|accessdate=March 20, 2006|date=November 18, 2004}}</ref> On November 20, Foley left CWA for Texas-based [[World Class Championship Wrestling]].\n\nIn [[World Class Championship Wrestling]] (WCCW), Cactus Jack, billed as Cactus Jack Manson, was a major part of [[Skandor Akbar]]'s stable. (The addition of \"Manson\" to Foley's name, due to its implied connection to [[Charles Manson]], made him uncomfortable.)<ref>Foley, ''Have A Nice Day!'', p. 131, 146</ref> Foley also won several titles, including the company's light heavyweight and tag team titles before leaving the company, losing his last match to [[Eric Embry]] in nine seconds. He then briefly competed in Alabama's Continental Wrestling Federation before completing a brief stint with [[World Championship Wrestling]]. For much of his time there, he would team with jobbers.  When the jobber would lose the match for the team, Cactus Jack would attack his partner, throw them out of the ring, and deliver his infamous ring apron flying elbow drop onto the concrete floor. One notable occasion he did this was in [[Gainesville, Georgia]] against the rising tag team of brothers [[Rick Steiner|Rick]] and [[Scott Steiner]]- two of the stiffest workers in wrestling at the time. Cactus was partnered with a one-time jobber named Rick Fargo, and after taking brutal bumps from both Steiner brothers and losing the match, Cactus then began fighting with Fargo, and then jumped nearly 12 feet off the apron to elbow Fargo in the abdomen, per Kevin Sullivan\u2019s instructions. Lead WCW booker [[Ric Flair]], Sullivan and other WCW executives were impressed with this to the point that they offered Foley a contract, and Foley finally found some financial stability after years of hardship. His biggest match at the time was a few weeks later against [[Mil M\u00e1scaras]] at ''[[Clash of the Champions X: Texas Shootout]]'', where he took a particularly brutal bump backwards off the 3-foot high apron and landed on the concrete floor, with his head and back taking the impact.<ref>Foley, ''Have A Nice Day!'', p. 169</ref> It was during this period that Foley was involved in a car accident that resulted in the loss of his two front teeth, adding to the distinctive look for which he is famous.<ref>Foley, ''Have A Nice Day!'', pp. 164\u2013166</ref> Following the short stint with WCW, Foley then signed with [[Herb Abrams]]'s [[Universal Wrestling Federation (Herb Abrams)|Universal Wrestling Federation]].<ref name=SlamFoleyBio/><ref>Foley, ''Have A Nice Day!'', p. 183</ref> In UWF, Foley teamed with [[Bob Orton, Jr.|Bob Orton]] to feud with [[Don Muraco]], [[Sunny Beach (wrestler)|Sunny Beach]], and [[Brian Blair]].\n\nHe soon left UWF for [[Professional wrestling promotion|Tri-State Wrestling]] (a forerunner to [[Extreme Championship Wrestling]]),<ref>Foley, ''Have A Nice Day!'', p. 192</ref> whose high-impact and violent wrestling style fit Foley well. On one night, known as Tri-State's Summer Sizzler 1991, Cactus Jack and [[Eddie Gilbert (wrestler)|Eddie Gilbert]] had three matches in one night: Cactus won a [[Professional wrestling match types#Falls Count Anywhere match|Falls Count Anywhere match]], lost a [[Professional wrestling match types#Container-based variations|Stretcher match]], and then fought to a double [[Professional wrestling#Disqualification|disqualification]] in a [[Professional wrestling match types#steel Cage match|Steel Cage match]].<ref name=mf194>Foley, ''Have A Nice Day!'', pp. 194\u2013195</ref> These matches caught the attention of [[World Championship Wrestling]] promoters, in large part due to widespread photo circulation. In 1991, after a brief stint working in the [[Global Wrestling Federation]], Foley joined WCW full-time.<ref name=SlamFoleyBio/><ref name=mf194/>\n\n=== World Championship Wrestling===\n==== Early years (1991\u20131993) ====\nOn September 5, 1991, Cactus Jack debuted as a [[Heel (professional wrestling)|heel]] and attacked [[Sting (wrestler)|Sting]].<ref>Foley, ''Have A Nice Day!'', p. 201</ref> After feuds with [[Van Hammer]] and [[Abdullah the Butcher]], Cactus Jack faced Sting, then WCW World Heavyweight Champion, in a non-title Falls Count Anywhere match at [[Beach Blast (1992)|Beach Blast]] in 1992, which Sting won.<ref name=mf223>Foley, ''Have A Nice Day!'', p. 223</ref> For a long time, Foley considered this the best match he ever worked.<ref name=mf223/> Unlike Jack's first stint in WCW, where his personality was quieter, he was now outwardly maniacal; laughing hysterically, shrieking into the air while choking his opponents and yelling his signature catchphrase \"Bang-Bang!\".\n\nAfter spending a year and a half with WCW as a heel, Cactus Jack transitioned into a fan favorite after engaging in a feud with Paul Orndorff, Harley Race and Big Van Vader. Jack and Orndorff wrestled each other in a match for a spot on WCW World Heavyweight Champion Vader's team at ''[[Clash of the Champions XXII]]''. After the match, Race and Orndorff beat up Jack. At the following Clash of Champions event, Cactus Jack helped Sting's team win the match. He engaged in a feud with Orndorff, winning a falls-count-anywhere match against Orndorff at [[SuperBrawl III]]. He then moved on to face Big Van Vader.\n\n==== Feud with Vader (1993\u20131994) ====\nCactus Jack wrestled [[Big Van Vader]] on April 6, 1993, winning by count-out, but being severely beaten in the process. As a result, in the rematch with Vader on April 24, the two executed a dangerous spot to sell a storyline injury. Harley Race removed the protective mats at ringside and Vader [[powerbomb]]ed Cactus onto the exposed concrete floor, causing a legitimate concussion and causing Foley to temporarily lose sensation in his left foot.<ref>Foley, ''Have A Nice Day!'', pp. 243\u2013244</ref> While Foley was away, WCW ran an [[glossary of professional wrestling terms#Angle|angle]] where Cactus Jack's absence was explained with a [[Farce|farcical]] comedy storyline in which he went crazy, was institutionalized, escaped, and developed amnesia.<ref name=mf248>Foley, ''Have A Nice Day!'', pp. 248\u2013250</ref> Foley had wanted the injury storyline to be very serious and generate genuine sympathy for him before his return. The comedy [[glossary of professional wrestling terms#Vignette|vignettes]] that WCW produced instead were so bad that Foley jokes in ''Have a Nice Day'' that they were the brainchild of WCW executives who regarded a surefire moneymaking feud as a problem that needed to be solved. The angle was awarded \"Most Disgusting Promotional Tactic\" by the esteemed [[Dave Meltzer|Wrestling Newsletter Observer]].<ref name=mf248/>\n\nIn one of WCW's most brutal matches of all time, Cactus faced Vader in a [[professional wrestling match types#Last Man Standing match|Texas Death match]] at [[Halloween Havoc (1993)|Halloween Havoc]].<ref>Foley, ''Have A Nice Day!'', p. 256</ref> Race won the match for Vader by using a stun gun on Cactus, knocking him out. The level of violence involved in this feud caused WCW to refuse to book Cactus Jack against Vader on a pay-per-view again. On March 16, 1994, during a WCW European tour, Foley and Big Van Vader had one of the most infamous matches in wrestling history in [[Munich]], Germany. Foley began a hangman\u2014a planned move where a wrestler's head is tangled between the top two ring ropes. Neither wrestler was aware that the ring ropes had been drawn extra tight before the event, and Foley was barely able to move. When Foley finally freed himself from the ropes and fell out of the ring, his ears were badly split at the back. When Foley re-entered the ring the two wrestlers began trading blows. During this time, Vader reached up and grabbed Foley's right ear, and ripped it off. The two men continued wrestling as the referee picked up the ear and gave it to the ring announcer. Vader claimed for years after that the ear had come off during the botched Hangman maneuver, however in a WWE Network video, Vader admits that after seeing footage that he had indeed removed Foley's ear. Cactus Jack and [[Kevin Sullivan (wrestler)|Kevin Sullivan]] were scheduled to win the tag team titles at [[Slamboree (1994)|Slamboree]] in 1994.<ref>Foley, ''Have A Nice Day!'', p. 272</ref> Foley had to choose between reattaching his ear or wrestling in the pay-per-view and winning the titles. Foley chose to wrestle and won his only championship in WCW. Later on, Foley was frustrated by WCW and the company\u2019s new head [[Eric Bischoff]]\u2019s reluctance to work a storyline with Vader around losing his ear.\n\nWCW also shared a brief co-promotion with ECW during this time in which Foley represented WCW on ECW television as the WCW Tag Team champion, facing [[Sabu (wrestler)|Sabu]] at [[Hostile City Showdown]] on June 24, 1994. During a promo, Foley spat on his Tag Team title belt and threw it to the ground to appeal to the hardcore fans who frowned upon the mainstream promotions.\n\n=== NWA Eastern/Extreme Championship Wrestling (1994\u20131996) ===\nCactus Jack's first appearance for the NWA-affiliated [[Eastern Championship Wrestling]] came on the May 31, 1994 episode, with Cactus revealed as Sabu's opponent for June 24 at the ECW Arena in Philadelphia. After being part of a talent exchange between ECW & WCW, Foley brought his WCW tag team title belt and spit on it for a recorded ECW tv segment. Foley continued with ECW and began a feud with [[Sabu (wrestler)|Sabu]]. Foley then began working the ECW tag team division on teams with [[Terry Funk]], [[Mikey Whipwreck]], and [[Kevin Sullivan (wrestler)|Kevin Sullivan]]. He had two [[ECW World Tag Team Championship]] reigns with Whipwreck while in ECW.<ref name=ECWtag>{{cite web|url=http://www.wrestling-titles.com/us/ecw/ecw-t.html|title=ECW World Tag Team Title history with his son alex foley|publisher=Wrestling-titles.com}}</ref>\n\nAfter the stints in Smokey Mountain Wrestling and Japan noted below, Foley then returned to ECW to have a series of violent encounters with the Sandman, while challenging him and claiming that he had never been beaten in a falls count anywhere match. He then started to team with [[Tommy Dreamer]]. According to Heyman, Hardcore style differentiated Foley from other traditional wrestlers, so in ECW, Foley was right at home. After seeing a sign in the audience one night that said \"Cane Dewey\" a reference to Foley's real-life son, Foley began a [[gimmick (professional wrestling)|gimmick]] where he criticized hardcore wrestling and sought to renounce his status as a hardcore wrestling icon and used a very technical, slow wrestling as a way to punish the audience.<ref name=\"MondayNightWars\" >{{cite DVD|title=Monday Night War S01 E05:Have a Nice Day!|publisher=WWE|}}</ref> He said that he was on a mission to save his partner from making the mistake of trying to please bloodthirsty fans. The mismatched partnership lasted until August 5, 1995, when Cactus turned on Dreamer when they were teaming with [[The Pitbulls]] against Raven, [[Stevie Richards]] and [[The Dudley Brothers]] ([[Dudley Dudley (wrestler)|Dudley Dudley]] and [[Big Dick Dudley]]).  Cactus Jack DDT'ed his partner and joined Raven's Nest, as he wished to serve [[Raven (wrestler)|Raven]]'s \"higher purpose\". He remained one of Raven's top henchmen for the remainder of his time in ECW. On August 28, Cactus beat the previously undefeated [[911 (wrestler)|911]]. As part of Foley's heel [[gimmick (professional wrestling)|gimmick]], he began praising WWF and WCW on ECW television, which angered ECW fans. Their anger intensified once word began to spread that Foley was leaving to join the WWF (In ''Have a Nice Day'', Foley recounted an incident where he asked an ECW roadie to sell T-shirts for him at an event held in a Queens, New York venue where he had been popular even as a heel; the man came back after being spat upon numerous times by angry fans, who made him fear for his life<ref>Foley, ''Have A Nice Day!'', '''p.??'''</ref>). Even when he tried to give sincere good-byes to the fans, Cactus Jack was met with chants of \"You sold out\" by the ECW fanbase everywhere he went. Cactus was booked to face WWF hater [[Shane Douglas]], who won after he handcuffed Cactus and then hit him with no less than '''''ten''''' consecutive plastic chair shots and when he put Jack into a [[Professional wrestling holds#Figure four leglock|figure four leglock]], this allowed Mikey Whipwreck to get into the arena and land one last very hard chair shot to Cactus's face, knocking him unconscious. Foley's last ECW match was against Whipwreck on March 9, 1996, and he recounts that he was not looking forward to it due to the increasingly hostile reactions he got even when he wasn't in character. The ECW fans, who knew that this was Foley's last match, finally returned his affection. They cheered him throughout the match and chanted, \"Please don't go!\". After the match, Foley told the audience that their reaction made everything worthwhile and made his exit by dancing with [[Stevie Richards]] and [[The Blue Meanie]] to [[Frank Sinatra]]'s song \"[[Theme from New York, New York|New York, New York]]\". Foley has said that this exit was his favorite moment in wrestling.<ref name=SlamFoleyBio/><ref>Mick Foley, ''Mick Foley's Greatest Hits and Misses: A Life in Wrestling''</ref>\n\n=== Smoky Mountain Wrestling and Japan (1994\u20131996)===\nAt the tail end of 1994, Foley joined [[Smoky Mountain Wrestling]] (SMW) as Cactus Jack, causing [[Balls Mahoney|Boo Bradley]] to lose the [[SMW Beat the Champ Television Championship]]. He often teamed with [[Brian Lee (wrestler)|Brian Lee]] to feud with Bradley and [[Chris Candido]]. Cactus Jack then began a crusade to rid Bradley of his valet [[Tammy Lynn Sytch|Tamara Fytch]]. He ignited a feud between Candido and Bradley when he accused Candido of having sexual relations with Fytch. (Ironically, Candido and Fytch were a couple in real life). Cactus Jack left SMW before the feud was resolved.\n\nIn 1995, Foley went to Japan and wrestled in [[International Wrestling Association of Japan]] (IWA Japan), where he engaged in feuds with Terry Funk and Shoji Nakamaki. During his brief stint in Japan Foley had the nickname \"Tsunami Stopper.\" Foley, however, soon returned to ECW to feud with [[The Sandman (wrestler)|The Sandman]]. Funk returned to team up with Sandman, and during a particularly violent spot, the pair hit Cactus with a [[Shinai|kendo stick]] forty-six times in a barbed wire rope match. Cactus Jack then defeated Funk at Hostile City Showdown 1995. Later, he fought Sandman for the ECW championship. During the match, Cactus Jack knocked Sandman unconscious and was declared the winner. Referee [[Bill Alfonso]], however, reversed his decision because the title cannot change hands by knockout.\n\nReturning to the IWA, Cactus Jack began a feud with [[Michael Kirchner|Leatherface]], whom he had betrayed during a tag team match. Foley also continued to wrestle in independent circuits, winning championships on the Ozark Mountain and [[Steel City Wrestling|Steel City]] circuits. On August 20, 1995, IWA organized a [[IWA Kawasaki Dream#1995 King of the Death Match Tournament|King of the Death Match]] tournament at their [[IWA Kawasaki Dream|Kawasaki Dream]] event, which featured some of the bloodiest, most violent and most brutal matches of Foley's career. Each level of the tournament featured a new and deadly [[gimmick (professional wrestling)|gimmick]]: Cactus Jack's first-round during the day was a barbed-wire baseball bat, thumbtack deathmatch, in which he defeated Terry Gordy; the second round was a barbed-wire board, bed of nails match where Cactus Jack defeated Shoji Nakamaki. The final, at night against Terry Funk, was a barbed-wire rope, barbed-wire and [[C-4 (explosive)|C4]] board, time-bomb deathmatch, which Cactus Jack won with help from [[Tiger Jeet Singh]]. After the match, both men were covered in blood, ravaged by flesh cuts from the wire and burned by the C4 explosions. Foley later said that he only received $300 for the entire night,<ref>''Mick Foley's Greatest Hits and Misses: A Life in Wrestling'' DVD</ref> but in 2010 he wrote that, \"looking back that match in Honjo is probably the performance I'm proudest of.\"<ref name=\"Slate\" /> After the tournament, Foley's right arm had second-degree burns from the C-4 explosions from the match with Funk and his arm smelt of explosive chemicals. After a 14-hour flight from [[Tokyo]]'s [[Narita Airport]] to [[JFK Airport]] his father picked him up from the airport to take him back to his Long Island home, and immediately smelt something unusual. When Foley got home, his father and wife kept asking him about the awful smell, but he would not say anything, not wanting them to worry. After his father left, his wife persisted, so he revealed the burns to her. Later on, he teamed with [[Tracy Smothers]] for a quick run with the IWA tag team titles.\n\n=== World Wrestling Federation/WWF===\n==== Three faces of Foley (1996\u20131998) ====\nIn 1996, at the persistence of [[Jim Ross]], whom Foley had known in his days in WCW, WWF head [[Vince McMahon]] brought on Foley, and he signed a contract with WWF and this time, the WWF did not use Foley as \"[[Job (professional wrestling)|enhancement talent]]\". McMahon was not a fan of Cactus Jack and wanted to cover up Foley's face, so he was shown several designs for a new heel character- a man with a leather mask and chains, called '''Mason the Mutilator'''. However, WWF decided that it was too dark and only left the mask, and although interested in the concept of the character, Foley did not like the name, so he came up with the name '''Mankind''', which company head [[Vince McMahon]] liked and approved.<ref name=\"FoleyDVD\">{{cite AV media|date=May 3, 2013|title=Mick Foley: For All Mankind|medium=DVD|publisher=[[WWE Home Video]]}}</ref> Foley arrived in the WWF in 1996 debuting a [[gimmick (professional wrestling)|gimmick]] that was perhaps his most famous personality: Mankind was a mentally deranged schizophrenic who constantly squealed (even throughout his matches), shrieked ''\"Mommy!\"'', spoke to a rat named George, enjoyed pain, physically abused himself (such as by pulling out his hair) and wore a mask; Mankind's finishing move was the [[professional wrestling hold#mandible claw|Mandible Claw]] nerve hold, which involved sticking his ring and middle fingers in his opponent's mouth. His catchphrase was \"Have a nice day!\" and he lived in [[Mechanical room|boiler rooms]]; hence, his specialty match, the [[Professional wrestling match types#Boiler Room Brawl|Boiler Room Brawl]].<ref name=\"IGN\"/> This specific match was a chaotic, dangerous and sometimes violent match that took place inside an arena's mechanical/boiler room, with all sorts of exposed metal piping with large bolts, concrete flooring and solid electrical equipment everywhere, and it was a no disqualification match, so foreign objects were allowed, and the match's objective was to escape the boiler room first.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://wrestlingnews.co/columns/who-really-gets-credit-for-creating-the-boiler-room-brawl/ |title = Who really gets credit for creating the Boiler Room Brawl?|date = August 15, 2017 |accessdate=March 30, 2020}}</ref>\n\nOn the April 1, 1996, episode of ''[[WWE Raw|Monday Night Raw]]'' in [[San Bernardino, California]], the day after [[WrestleMania XII]], Mankind debuted on TV and defeated [[Hardcore Holly|Bob \u201cSpark Plug\u201d Holly]], quickly moving into a feud with [[The Undertaker]]. The creatively inclined and dedicated Foley initially would prepare for playing Mankind by researching the character, often spending the night in the respective arena's boiler room and sometimes under the wrestling ring for the first few months, but after that he could get into character almost instantly. The two then began interfering in the other's matches until they were booked in the first-ever Boiler Room Brawl, and in addition to escaping the arena's boiler room, the combatant also had to reach the ring and take the urn from Paul Bearer. After 30 minutes of brawling in the boiler room, the backstage corridors and the entrance ramp, and both men taking some bumps involving metal trash cans, tables, ladders, metal poles, hot coffee and the exposed concrete floor, The Undertaker appeared to have won, but Paul Bearer refused to hand him the urn, allowing Mankind to win, thus (for the time being) ending the relationship between Paul and The Undertaker. While Mankind was managed by Paul Bearer, he referred to him as \"Uncle Paul\". Mankind then became the number one contender to face the then WWF Champion [[Shawn Michaels]] at [[In Your House 10: Mind Games|In Your House: Mind Games]]. Michaels won by disqualification via interference by [[Big Van Vader|Vader]] and The Undertaker.\n\nThe Mankind and Undertaker rivalry continued with the first-ever [[Professional wrestling match types#Buried Alive match|Buried Alive match]] at [[In Your House 11: Buried Alive|In Your House: Buried Alive]]. Undertaker won the match, but Paul Bearer, the [[Terry Gordy|Executioner]], Mankind and other heels attacked The Undertaker and buried him alive. Afterward, The Undertaker challenged Mankind to a match at [[Survivor Series (1996)|Survivor Series]], which the Undertaker won. The feud continued after another match at [[In Your House 14: Revenge of the 'Taker|In Your House: Revenge of the Taker]] for the WWF World Heavyweight Championship, which Undertaker had won at [[WrestleMania 13]]. Undertaker won the match and Bearer took a leave of absence, continuing the feud. [[Jim Ross]] then began conducting a series of interviews with Mankind. During the interviews, Ross brought up the topic of Foley's home videos and the hippie-inspired character he played in them, Dude Love, as well as his tormented journey in wrestling. The interviews also affected the fans, who began cheering Mankind, turning him into a face.\n\nAround this time, [[Stone Cold Steve Austin]] and Shawn Michaels won the WWF Tag Team Championships from [[Owen Hart]] and [[Davey Boy Smith|The British Bulldog]], but Michaels was injured and could no longer compete. Mankind tried to replace him, but Austin said he wanted \"nothing to do with a freak\" and resigned himself to facing Hart and the Bulldog alone the next week. Halfway into the match, however, Foley debuted a new persona known as Dude Love, who helped Austin take the victory, becoming the new Tag Team Champions.<ref name=\"Worldtag\">{{cite web|url=http://www.wrestling-titles.com/wwe/wwf-t.html|title=WWWF/WWF/WWE World Tag Team Title history|publisher=Wrestling-titles.com}}</ref> Austin and Foley vacated their tag team titles when Austin suffered a neck injury in a match at [[SummerSlam (1997)|SummerSlam]] in [[East Rutherford, New Jersey]]. Dude Love feuded with [[Triple H|Hunter Hearst Helmsley]], as the two competed in a [[Professional wrestling match types#Falls Count Anywhere match|Falls Count Anywhere match]]. One of Foley's most memorable vignettes aired before the match began, in which Dude Love and Mankind discussed who should wrestle the upcoming match. Eventually, \"they\" decided that it should be Cactus Jack, and Foley's old character made his WWF debut. Cactus Jack won the match with a [[Piledriver (professional wrestling)|piledriver]] through a table. Shortly thereafter, ECW's [[Terry Funk]] joined the WWF as Chainsaw Charlie. At the [[Royal Rumble (1998)|1998 Royal Rumble]], Foley participated under all three personas, Cactus Jack (1st entry), Mankind (16th), and Dude Love (28th). Charlie and Jack defeated [[the New Age Outlaws]] at [[WrestleMania XIV]] in a [[Professional wrestling match types#dumpster match|Dumpster match]] to win the tag team titles (which was originally supposed to be a barbed-wire rope match- but this very often violent and bloody match was scrapped due to the high profile appearance of [[Mike Tyson]] taking part at the event). The next night, however, [[Vince McMahon]] stripped them of the belts and scheduled a rematch in a steel cage, which the Outlaws won with help from their new allies, [[D-Generation X]]. On April 6, 1998, Foley turned heel when Cactus Jack explained the fans would not see him anymore because they did not appreciate him and only cared about Stone Cold Steve Austin. [[Vince McMahon]] explained to Austin the next week that he would face a \"mystery\" opponent at [[Unforgiven: In Your House|Unforgiven]]. That opponent turned out to be Dude Love, who won the match by disqualification, meaning that Austin retained the title. McMahon, displeased with the outcome, required Foley to prove he deserved another shot at Austin's title with a number one contenders match against his former partner, Terry Funk. The match was both the WWF's first-ever \"[[Hardcore wrestling|Hardcore match]]\" and the first time that Foley wrestled under his name. Foley won, and after the match, a proud McMahon came out to Dude Love's music and presented Foley with the Dude Love costume. At [[Over the Edge: In Your House|Over the Edge]], Dude Love took on Austin for the title. McMahon designated his subordinates [[Gerald Brisco]] and [[Pat Patterson (wrestler)|Pat Patterson]] as the timekeeper and ring announcer, and made himself the special referee. The Undertaker, however, came to ringside to ensure McMahon called the match fairly, and with his presence, Dude Love lost the match and was \"fired\" by McMahon on the June 1 episode of ''Raw''.\n\nOn that same episode of ''Raw'', Foley reverted to his Mankind character, who began wearing an untucked shirt with a loose necktie and resumed his feud with The Undertaker. At [[King of the Ring (1998)|King of the Ring]] in Pittsburgh\u2019s [[Civic Arena (Pittsburgh)|Civic Arena]] on June 28, the two performed in the [[the Undertaker vs. Mankind|third]] [[Hell in a Cell match]], which became one of most notable matches in professional wrestling history. Foley received numerous injuries and took two dangerous and highly influential [[Bump (professional wrestling)|bumps]]- the first being tossed off the top of the 16 foot high Cell by The Undertaker, crashing through the wooden Spanish announcer's table and landing on the arena's concrete floor. Barely five minutes after the first bump Foley, with a separated shoulder climbed back up to the top of the Cell after Terry Funk and others tried to stop him, and the second bump, which was an unplanned botch- The Undertaker Chokeslammed Foley, and the fenced panel Foley landed on broke and gave way, so Foley fell 13 feet and landed on the ring mat. Mankind lost the match to conclude their storyline.\n\n==== WWF Champion (1998\u20132000) ====\n{{main|The Rock 'n' Sock Connection}}\nAlthough conventional wisdom holds that the Hell in a Cell match was responsible for Foley's rise to main event status, live television crowds did not initially get behind Mankind because of the match.{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}} Following a couple of months of teaming with [[Kane (wrestler)|Kane]] who together won the WWF Tag Team Championship on two separate occasions and various feuds with Kane, Stone Cold Steve Austin and The Undertaker, Foley decided that crowds might respond better if Mankind were more of a comedy character, and so he abandoned the tortured soul characteristics and became more of a goofy, broken down oaf. He began the transition into this character following [[SummerSlam (1998)|SummerSlam]] in 1998 after Kane turned on him and the two lost the tag team championships.\n\nThe following month, Foley began an angle with Vince McMahon, with Mankind trying to be a friend to the hated Mr. McMahon. On the October 5 episode of ''Raw'', while McMahon was in a hospital nursing wounds suffered at the hands of The Undertaker and Kane, Mankind arrived with a female clown called Yurple in an attempt to cheer him up. Having succeeded only in irritating McMahon, Mankind then took a sock off his foot to create a sock puppet named '''\"Mr. Socko\"'''. Intended to be a one-time joke, Socko became an overnight sensation. Mankind began putting the sock on his hand before applying his finisher, the [[professional wrestling hold#mandible claw|Mandible Claw]], stuffing a smelly sock in the mouths of opposing wrestlers. The sweat sock became massively popular with the fans, mainly because it was marketed (mostly by [[Jerry Lawler|Jerry \"The King\" Lawler]] during the events) as being a dirty, smelly, sweaty, repulsive, and vile sock. McMahon manipulated Mankind, who saw the WWF owner as a father figure, into doing his bidding. McMahon created the [[WWE Hardcore Championship|Hardcore Championship]] and awarded it to Mankind, making him the first-ever champion of the hardcore division. Mankind was then pushed as the favorite to win the [[WWE World Championship|WWF Championship]] at [[Survivor Series (1998)|Survivor Series]], as McMahon appeared to be manipulating the tournament so that Mankind would win. He and [[Dwayne Johnson|The Rock]] both reached the finals, where McMahon turned on Mankind. As The Rock placed Mankind in the [[Sharpshooter (professional wrestling)|Sharpshooter]], McMahon ordered the timekeeper to ring the bell even though Mankind did not submit, a reference to the [[Montreal Screwjob]] from the year before. As a result of Survivor Series, Mankind officially turned face, while The Rock turned heel and became the crown jewel in McMahon's new [[The Corporation (professional wrestling)|Corporation]] faction.\n\nAfter weeks of trying to get his hands on McMahon's new faction, the [[The Corporation (professional wrestling)|Corporation]], Mankind received a title shot against [[Dwayne Johnson|The Rock]] at [[Rock Bottom: In Your House]]. Mankind won the match by using his mandible claw hold (with the 'Mr. Socko' prop on his hand) and the referee declared The Rock had become unresponsive. But McMahon overruled the title change because Mankind didn't keep his pre-match promise to make The Rock submit. After several weeks of going after the Corporation, Mankind defeated The Rock to win his first WWF Championship on December 29 in [[Worcester, Massachusetts]]. The taped show was broadcast on January 4, 1999, so that is the date WWE recognizes as beginning the title run. Having title changes on broadcast television rather than pay-per-view was uncommon in professional wrestling, but because of the [[Monday Night Wars#1997\u20131999: Attitude Era|Monday Night Wars]], TV ratings became more important. The head of rival promotion WCW [[Eric Bischoff]], attempting to take advantage of the fact that their show ''Monday Nitro'' aired live while Mankind's title victory was taped the week before, had announcer [[Tony Schiavone]] reveal the ending of the Mankind-Rock match before it aired. He then added sarcastically, \"That'll put a lot of butts in the seats.\" The move backfired for WCW, as [[Nielsen ratings]] showed that Raw won the ratings battle that night, despite the [[The Fingerpoke of Doom|Hulk Hogan vs. Kevin Nash main event]] which led to the reformation of the [[New World Order (professional wrestling)|New World Order]]. Foley said that the ratings indicate that large numbers of viewers switched from ''Nitro'' to ''Raw'' to see him win the title and took great personal pride from this.\n\nMankind lost the WWF Championship to The Rock in an [[\"I Quit\" match]] at [[Royal Rumble (1999)|Royal Rumble]] at the [[Arrowhead Pond]] in [[Anaheim, California]] near [[Los Angeles]], in what is regarded as one of the company's most brutal matches. During the match, Foley took several violent and dangerous bumps from [[Dwayne Johnson|The Rock]] all over the arena, including repeated steel chair shots to the head and a fall from the stands onto solid electrical objects, which sparked upon impact. Although steel chair shots to the head were commonplace in the Attitude Era, the most a wrestler would take in a single ten-minute match was two, or sometimes three, with their hands in front of their head to ease the blow and lessen a chance of a concussion- but Foley had taken '''''eleven''''' in the span of two and a half minutes- all unprotected because he had been handcuffed just before The Rock began his repeated onslaught. Foley was originally supposed to take five chair shots to the head with the final match-ending shot being two-thirds up the entrance ramp, but after the fifth shot, Foley was still at ringside, and even after Foley signaled to The Rock to hit him in the back, The Rock decided to keep to the match's brutal tone based on Foley's previous calling of similar shots on the spot, and he hit Foley six more times in the head until they got to the two-thirds mark. This match is featured in Barry Blaustein's documentary ''[[Beyond the Mat]]'', which shows the impact the match had on Foley, his family and even the rest of the audience at ringside, and at one point Foley's five-year-old daughter Noelle cried and screamed in horror, believing her father was dying as The Rock pummeled Foley with repeated chair shots. The match got to a point that people sitting in the front of the audience screamed and signalled at the referee and The Rock to stop the match.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://deadspin.com/twenty-years-ago-the-rock-beat-mick-foley-about-the-he-1832057103|title=Twenty Years Ago, The Rock Beat Mick Foley About The Head And It Was Fucked Up|accessdate=August 9, 2019 |author=David Bixenspan |url-status=live}}</ref> The match ended after Mankind lost consciousness, and The Rock's allies played a recording of Mankind saying \"I Quit\" from an earlier interview he did with Shane McMahon. \n\nMankind won the title back in a rematch on Halftime Heat, which aired during halftime of [[Super Bowl XXXIII]], in the WWF's first-ever [[Professional wrestling match types#Empty Arena match|Empty Arena match]] in [[Tucson, Arizona]] on January 31. After 20 minutes of brawling in the ring, the empty grandstands, a kitchen, the arena's hallways, an office, and the catering hall, Mankind used a [[forklift]] to pin The Rock in a basement loading area. The two then competed in a [[Professional wrestling match types|Last Man Standing match]] at [[St. Valentine's Day Massacre: In Your House|St. Valentine's Day Massacre]], which ended without a winner, meaning that Mankind retained the title. The next night, Mr. McMahon booked a ladder match for the championship, which The Rock won with help from [[Paul Wight|The Big Show]]. Mankind would go on to [[WrestleMania XV|WrestleMania]] to defeat The Big Show and again at [[Backlash (1999)|Backlash]] a month later in a violent and brutal Boiler Room Brawl (the first in the WWF since July 1996), where the objective of the match had been simplified from the 1996 match to just escape the boiler room. Shortly after Big Show would team with Mankind, Test and Shamrock to take on the Corporation at Over The Edge. Later in the year, Foley and The Rock patched up their friendship and teamed up to form a comedy team called [[the Rock 'n' Sock Connection]], becoming one of the most popular teams during that time. The pair won the tag team titles on three occasions. One notable match was a Buried Alive match that pitted the Rock \u2018n\u2019 Sock Connection against The Undertaker and The Big Show, who were out for revenge after losing the tag titles one week earlier. This match included a spot where The Big Show tossed Mankind off the stage, landing hard on the dirt and falling into the grave- Mankind traveled nearly 25 feet in total. Foley then helped ''Raw'' achieve its highest [[Nielsen ratings|ratings]] ever with a segment featuring himself (as Mankind) and The Rock. The \"This Is Your Life\" segment aired on September 27, 1999, and received an 8.4 rating, with Yurple the Clown making another appearance.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://slashwrestling.com/raw/990927.html |title=Slashwrestling Raw report \u2013 with ratings |accessdate=January 13, 2007 |author=Christopher Robin Zimmerman |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061102112807/http://slashwrestling.com/raw/990927.html |archivedate=November 2, 2006 }}</ref>\n\nIn August 1999, Foley returned after a three-month absence recovering from knee surgery to resume his feud with [[Triple H]], who had kayfabe injured Foley's left knee with his sledgehammer. On an episode of ''Raw'', Mankind drew with Triple H in a match for the number one contender for the WWF Championship, which resulted in a Triple Threat match between Steve Austin, Triple H and Mankind at [[SummerSlam (1999)|SummerSlam]] for the title. Foley won the WWF Championship for the third time at [[SummerSlam (1999)|SummerSlam]], pinning the reigning champion Austin.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://slam.canoe.ca/SlamWrestlingArchive/aug23_fol.html|last=Powell|first=John|title=Mick Foley New Champion at SummerSlam!|publisher=SLAM!

The next night on ''Raw'', Triple H defeated Mankind to win his first WWF championship. A feud then developed between Mankind and the McMahon-Helmsley regime, led by Triple H. This included Triple H defeating Mankind in another Boiler Room Brawl on the September 23 edition of ''Smackdown!'', as part of a five-match \u201cgauntlet\u201c challenge set upon Triple H by Vince McMahon.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWXn5CtCYOk&t=1s|title=Triple H vs Mankind (Boiler Room Brawl) - Sept 23, 1999|accessdate=June 30, 2019 |author=WWE}}</ref>\n\nMankind continued his feud with Triple H when he was supposed to have the last Boiler Room Brawl match with \"[[Santa Claus]]\".

Foley then reverted to his Cactus Jack persona in January 2000 and faced Triple H for the WWF Championship at [[Royal Rumble (2000)|Royal Rumble]] in a [[Hardcore wrestling|Street Fight]]. Cactus used a 2x4 wrapped in barbed wire, and thumbtacks- trademark weapons from his pre-WWF days, but Triple H won the match after delivering two pedigrees, the second slamming Cactus face-first onto a pile of tacks. This feud culminated with a rematch at [[No Way Out (2000)|No Way Out]] in a Hell in a Cell match, where stipulations held that Cactus Jack could not use foreign metallic objects he used in the Royal Rumble, and if he did not win the title, Foley had to retire from wrestling. During the match, they had made their way onto the top of the cell and Foley was preparing to Piledrive Triple H onto a barbed wire 2x4 on fire, but Triple H reversed it into a backdrop, causing the cage to give way, Foley fell through the canvas. Triple H then pinned an exhausted Foley for a three-count, winning the match and Foley's career was over.<ref name=NoWayOut2000>{{cite web|title=Triple H vs. Cactus Jack \u2013 Hell in a Cell Match for the WWE Championship|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/nowayout/2000/mainevent|publisher=[[WWE]]|accessdate=May 25, 2012|date=February 27, 2000}}</ref> Foley left for a few weeks, but returned at the request of [[Linda McMahon]] to wrestle for the title at the main event of [[WrestleMania 2000]] against Triple H, The Rock and Big Show.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4155/is_20000402/ai_n13856891|title=Foley's dream to come true at 'WrestleMania'|author=Blackjack Brown|publisher=Chicago Sun Times|accessdate=June 9, 2007|date=April 2, 2000 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071209222307/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4155/is_20000402/ai_n13856891 <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = December 9, 2007}}</ref> Triple H won, and Foley did not wrestle again for four years.\n\n==== Commissioner and departure (2000\u20132001) ====\n[[File:MickFoleyandDudleys.jpg|thumb|Foley at [[WrestleMania X-Seven]] Fan Axxess]]\nAfter retiring from active competition, Foley served as storyline [[Professional wrestling authority figures#Commissioners|WWF Commissioner]] under his real name rather than one of his personas. Foley has said that he intended for his Commissioner Foley character to be a \"role model for nerds,\" cracking lame jokes and making no attempt to appear tough or scary. He also had a knack during this time to have no one spot for his office; rather, Mick would have an office in all sorts of odd places (for example, closets). Foley turned getting [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#pop|cheap pops]] into something of a catchphrase, as he shamelessly declared at each WWF show that he was thrilled to be \"right here in (whatever city in which he was performing (e.g., New York))!\" punctuated with an intentionally cheesy thumbs-up gesture. During this time, Commissioner Foley engaged in rivalries with [[Kurt Angle]], [[Edge and Christian]], and Vince McMahon without actually wrestling them. He left the position in December 2000 after being \"fired\" onscreen by McMahon during which he received a brutal beat down.\n\nFoley made a surprise return on the ''Raw'' just before [[WrestleMania X-Seven]] and announced that he would be the [[referee (professional wrestling)#Special referee|special guest referee]] in the match between Mr. McMahon and his son Shane at WrestleMania. After WrestleMania, Foley made sporadic appearances on WWF programming throughout the middle of the year, at one point introducing Minnesota Governor [[Jesse Ventura]] during a taping of ''Raw'' in the state as a foil to Mr. McMahon, as well as serving as the guest referee for the Earl Hebner versus Nick Patrick Referee match and a tag-team bra and panties match between WWF wrestlers [[Lita (wrestler)|Lita]] & [[Trish Stratus]] vs WCW stars [[Stacy Keibler]] & [[Torrie Wilson]] at the [[WWF Invasion]] pay-per-view. Foley returned as commissioner in October 2001, near the end of [[The Invasion (professional wrestling)|The Invasion]] angle. During this brief tenure, Foley had the opportunity to [[Shoot (professional wrestling)|shoot]] on the WWF's direction and how dissatisfied he was with it. Saying that there were far too many championships in the company, he booked unification matches before the final pay-per-view of the storyline, [[Survivor Series (2001)|Survivor Series]]. After Survivor Series, he ended his commissionership at Vince McMahon's request and left the company.\n\n=== Independent circuit (2003\u20132005) ===\nDuring his absences from WWE, Foley made frequent appearances on the [[independent circuit]] from 2003 to 2005, primarily in non-wrestling roles, either as a referee, manager, or special guest.\n\nHis first independent circuit appearance was on December 12, 2003 for International Wrestling Cartel, where he was the special guest referee for a match between [[Dusty Rhodes (wrestler)|Dusty Rhodes]] and [[Jerry Lawler]].\n\nFoley did not appear on the independent circuit again until May 2004, when he appeared for the Japanese promotion [[HUSTLE]] and returned to the ring to face [[Toshiaki Kawada]] for the [[Triple Crown Heavyweight Championship]], but ended up losing.\n\nOn September 11, 2004, Foley made his debut for [[Ring of Honor]] and cut a promo, praising ROH and referring to it as \"Ring of Hardcore\", thus establishing himself as a [[Face (professional wrestling)|babyface]]. On October 3, Foley refereed a match between Jerry Lawler and [[Slyck Wagner Brown]] for the New England Wrestling promotion. On October 15, Foley returned to ROH where he confronted [[Ricky Steamboat]], who claimed that traditional wrestling was better than hardcore wrestling. The next day, both Foley and Steamboat cut promos on each other, leading to a match between two teams of wrestlers handpicked by both men, with [[Nigel McGuiness]] and [[Chad Collyer]] representing Steamboat and [[Dan Maff]] and [[B.J. Whitmer]] representing Foley, which was won by McGuiness and Collyer. On November 6, Foley teased a heel turn when he called [[ROH World Championship|ROH Champion]] [[Samoa Joe]] \"softcore\". On November 20, Foley made a surprise appearance for New York Wrestling Connection, making a run-in during [[Mikey Whipwreck]] and Ken Scampi's match against Mayhem and Tony Burma, where he helped Whipwreck and Scampi win.\n\nFoley made an appearance on the [[A Night of Appreciation for Sabu|Night of Appreciation for Sabu]], where he refereed the match between [[Shane Douglas]] and Raven, where Sabu himself interfered in the match and helped Douglas win.\n\nFoley returned to ROH on December 26 at ROH's Final Battle event and had his final confrontation with Ricky Steamboat, where the two made peace. On January 15, 2005, Foley turned heel after he was confronted by Samoa Joe and hit Joe over the head with a steel chair. One week later, Foley appeared with [[Border City Wrestling]] to referee the match between [[Alex Shelley]] and [[Chris Sabin]] for the BCW Television Championship, which Sabin won.\n\nFoley refereed the main event of the first [[WrestleReunion]] show, which saw Dusty Rhodes, [[Goldust|Dustin Rhodes]], and [[Mike Graham (wrestler)|Mike Graham]] battle [[Abdullah the Butcher]], [[Kevin Sullivan (wrestler)|Kevin Sullivan]], and [[CM Punk]].\n\nOn February 19, Foley resumed his feud with Samoa Joe in ROH, teasing a return to the ring but instead choosing [[Vordell Walker]] to fight Joe. After Joe defeated Walker, Foley introduced his \"backup plan\" New Cactus Jack to fight Joe in a second match, which Joe won as well.\n\nOn February 26, Foley appeared with Frank Goodman's USA Xtreme promotion, cutting a promo saying that there was no need to wait until June for an ECW reunion (referring to the upcoming [[Hardcore Homecoming]] show being put together by Shane Douglas), and brought out [[Axl Rotten]], Shane Douglas, [[Chris Candido]], [[Tammy Lynn Sytch|Tammy Sytch]], [[Balls Mahoney]], [[Al Snow]], [[Justin Credible]], [[The Sandman (wrestler)|The Sandman]], Terry Funk and Sabu, much to the excitement of the crowd, who began an \"E-C-Dub!\" chant. But then Raven came out and cut a promo saying that he had only ever been the one true star of ECW and everyone else had just been a [[Job (professional wrestling)|jobber]], leading to a match between Raven and Balls Mahoney later in the night, which Raven won by DQ when he threw fire in Mahoney's eyes. After this, Foley and several of the other ECW alumni came to the ring and attacked Raven.\n\nOn April 2, Foley appeared with [[Harley Race]]'s [[World League Wrestling]] to referee a match between [[William Mueller|Trevor Rhodes]] and Brandon Bishop, which was ruled a No-Contest. After the match, Rhodes, Bishop, and Johnny Gold all attacked Foley until Terry Funk and Harley Race ran in and fought the three wrestlers off. Afterwards, Foley left the arena with Funk and Race.\n\nOn April 30, Foley refereed a match at a Northeast Wrestling show between Jerry Lawler and [[King Kong Bundy]], which Lawler won.\n\nOn May 7, Foley made a return to the ring at the Mark Curtis Memorial Show, where he was victorious in a tag team match with Shane Douglas against Al Snow and [[D'Lo Brown]], which also featured [[Dominic DeNucci]] (Foley and Douglas' trainer) in his and Douglas' corner.\n\nThe main event of the ECW reunion show Hardcore Homecoming was Terry Funk against Sabu and Shane Douglas in a Triple Threat Elimination No Ropes Barbed Wire Match. During the middle of the match, [[Bill Alfonso]], who was in Sabu's corner, began pulling Shane Douglas into the wire, which led to [[Francine Fournier|Francine]], who was in Douglas' corner, attacking Alfonso. Using this as a distraction, Douglas brought a ladder into the ring when suddenly the lights in the arena went out. When they came back on, Foley was in the ring, as Cactus Jack, wearing a referee shirt. Foley pulled out a barbed-wire wrapped Mr. Socko and applied the Mandible Claw on Douglas, then DDT'd Douglas onto a steel chair. Terry Funk then crawled onto Douglas and eliminated him when Foley made the 3-count. After that, Funk targeted Sabu, throwing him into the barbed wire, then setting up a table and putting Sabu on it. Funk then climbed up the ladder, but before he got far, it collapsed from under his weight, sending him crashing through the table. Sabu then recovered, gave Funk an Arabian Facebuster off a chair, and pinned Funk to win the match. After the match ended, all four of them were greeted with chants of \"Terry!\" and \"Sabu!\" and \"Foley!\" and \"Thank You Shane!\" and of course \"E-C-Dub! E-C-Dub!\". The entire locker room emptied moments later and celebrated with Funk, Sabu, Foley, and Douglas in the ring to continued \"E-C-Dub\" chants.\n\nOn July 8, Foley returned to ROH as a face, confronting ROH Champion CM Punk, who had turned heel and mocked ROH and the championship after he had signed with WWE and threatened to take the title with him to WWE. Foley acted as a direct line to Vince McMahon, attempting to convince Punk to defend his title one last time on McMahon's orders before he departed from ROH.\n\nOn August 13, Foley made an appearance with Ballpark Brawl to make fun of [[Matthew Kaye|Matt Striker]], who had been doing an impersonation of The Rock. Later in the event, Foley refereed the Canes, Tables, and Chairs match between Sandman and Sabu, which Sandman won. After the match, Foley celebrated with Sandman by drinking beer with him in the middle of the ring.\n\nOn August 20, Foley returned to ROH again, as a face, to rescue [[Jade Chung]] from [[Prince Nana]]. Foley was then attacked from behind by Alex Shelley and [[The Embassy (professional wrestling)|The Embassy]] until [[Austin Aries]] and [[Roderick Strong]] chased them off. One week later, Foley returned to the ring for the second WrestleReunion show to team with Terry Funk and [[Dory Funk, Jr.]] in a losing effort against the [[The Midnight Express (professional wrestling)|Midnight Express]] ([[Stan Lane]], [[Bobby Eaton]], and [[Dennis Condrey]].)\n\nFoley made his final regular appearance with ROH on September 17, when he was in [[A.J. Styles]]' corner in a match against Embassy member [[Jimmy Rave]], which Styles won. Afterwards, Foley put over ROH huge saying he enjoyed being on ROH shows and would speak highly of it.\n\nFoley made his final major independent circuit appearance on the Tribute to ''Starrcade'' show on November 19 as the referee for the match between Dustin Rhodes and Terry Funk, which ended in a No-Contest.\n\n=== Return to WWE ===\n====Various feuds (2003&ndash;2006)====\nFoley returned in June 2003 to referee the [[Hell in a Cell]] match between Triple H and [[Kevin Nash]] at Bad Blood. On June 23, during a ''Raw'' broadcast in [[Madison Square Garden]], he was honored for his achievements in the ring and presented with the retired [[WWE Hardcore Championship]] belt. The evening ended with Foley taking a beating and kicked down a flight of stairs by [[Randy Orton]] and [[Ric Flair]]. In December 2003, Foley returned to replace Steve Austin as co-general manager of ''Raw''. He soon grew tired of the day-to-day travel and left his full-time duties to write and spend time with his family. In the storyline, Foley was afraid to wrestle a match with Intercontinental Champion [[Randy Orton]] on the December 15 episode of ''Raw'' and walked out of the match rather than face him, the result of the match was ruled a draw. After Foley walked backstage, Orton confronted him asking why he walked out of the match, calling him a coward in the process, before spitting in his face. Foley walked out of the arena afterwards.\n\nIn 2004, Foley returned briefly to wrestling, competing in the [[Royal Rumble]] and eliminating both Orton and himself with his trademark Cactus Jack clothesline. He and [[Dwayne Johnson|The Rock]] reunited as the Rock 'n' Sock Connection and lost a handicap match to [[Evolution (professional wrestling)|Evolution]] at [[WrestleMania XX]]. Foley and Orton continued to feud, culminating in a [[Hardcore wrestling|hardcore match]] for the [[WWE Intercontinental Championship]] at [[Backlash (2004)|Backlash]], where a thumbtack-covered Orton defeated Foley, as his Cactus Jack persona, to retain the title after hitting Foley with his signature move, the ''RKO'' onto a barbed wire covered baseball bat. Foley regards this match as possibly the best of his career.<ref>Foley, Mick. The Hardcore Diaries (p.260)</ref>\n\nFoley appeared as a color commentator at WWE's [[ECW One Night Stand (2005)|ECW One Night Stand]], which aired on June 12, 2005, and subsequently renewed his contract with WWE. Foley returned in 2005 in a match where fans were able to vote on which persona he would appear as\u2014Mankind, Dude Love, or Cactus Jack\u2014against [[Carly Col\u00f3n|Carlito]] at [[Taboo Tuesday (2005)|Taboo Tuesday]]. The fans voted for Mankind, who went on to win the match- this was the last time Foley ever wrestled as Mankind. On the February 16, 2006, ''Raw'', Foley returned to referee the WWE Championship match between [[Edge (wrestler)|Edge]] and [[John Cena]]. After Cena won, Edge attacked Foley, and the following week, Foley challenged Edge to a match at [[WrestleMania 22]]. In the intensely brutal match, the heavily bloodied and thumbtack-covered Edge defeated Foley after spearing him through a flaming table, where both performers suffered second-degree burns after anti-flame material was not applied to the flaming table, at their own request.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dt54lUPqWEk|title=Bruce Prichard shoots on Edge vs Mick Foley at Wrestlemania|accessdate=July 31, 2019|date=December 27, 2018}}</ref> In the weeks after the match, an \"impressed\" Foley turned heel and allied himself with Edge against the newly rejuvenated [[ECW (WWE brand)|ECW]]. At [[ECW One Night Stand (2006)|ECW One Night Stand]], Foley, Edge and [[Lita (wrestler)|Lita]] defeated Terry Funk, [[Tommy Dreamer]] and [[Beulah McGillicutty]] in a violent and brutal tag-team hardcore match, which included a spot where Funk hit Foley with a barbed wire 2x4 plank lit on fire, and the flame latched onto Foley, and he then fell onto a plywood board covered in more barbed wire.\n\nFoley then engaged in a storyline rivalry with [[Ric Flair]], inspired by real-life animosity between the two. In ''Have a Nice Day!'', Foley wrote that Flair was \"every bit as bad on the booking side of things as he was great on the wrestling side of it.\" In response, Flair wrote in his autobiography that Foley was \"a glorified stuntman\" and that he was able to climb the ladder in the WWF only because he was friends with the bookers. The two had a backstage confrontation at a ''Raw'' event in December 2004 in [[Huntsville]], [[Alabama]], but Foley has said that they have largely reconciled.<ref name=SlamFoleyRicFlair>{{cite web|last=Baines|first=Tim|url=http://slam.canoe.ca/Slam/Wrestling/2004/06/27/516827.html|title= Ric Flair Critical of Mick Foley in New Book|publisher=SLAM! Wrestling|accessdate=March 20, 2006|date=June 27, 2004}}</ref> To spark the feud, Flair again called Foley a \"glorified [[Stunt performer|stuntman]]\" and Foley called Flair a \"washed up piece of crap\" and challenged him to a match. The result was a Two-out-of-Three Falls match at [[Vengeance (2006)|Vengeance]], where Flair beat Foley in two straight falls. The two then wrestled in an intensely brutal and bloody [[\"I Quit\" match|\"I Quit\" hardcore match]] at [[SummerSlam (2006)|SummerSlam]] in which Flair, who was covered in blood, thumbtacks and cuts from barbed wire won the match when he forced Foley to quit by threatening [[Melina Perez|Melina]] with a barbed-wire bat.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4155/is_20060827/ai_n16698659|title=Flair and Foley put on great show|publisher=Chicago Sun Times|accessdate=June 11, 2007|date=August 27, 2006 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071209071650/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4155/is_20060827/ai_n16698659 <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = December 9, 2007}}</ref> On the August 21 episode of ''Raw'', Foley kissed [[Vince McMahon]]'s buttocks as part of McMahon's \"[[Vince McMahon#The Invasion and brand extension (2001\u20132005)|Kiss My Ass Club]]\" [[gimmick (professional wrestling)|gimmick]] after he threatened to fire Melina. Shortly thereafter, she betrayed Foley and announced that he was fired.\n\n====Sporadic appearances and SmackDown color commentator (2007&ndash;2008)====\nSeven months later, Foley made his return to ''Raw'' as a face on March 5, 2007, with the storyline being that he tricked McMahon into giving him his job back. At [[Vengeance: Night of Champions|Vengeance]], Foley wrestled in a WWE Championship Challenge match involving WWE Champion [[John Cena]], [[Randy Orton]], [[Booker T (wrestler)|King Booker]], and [[Bobby Lashley]]. Cena retained by pinning Foley. A month later, Foley made an appearance on ''Raw'' as the special guest referee for a match between [[Jonathan Coachman]] and Mr. McMahon's storyline illegitimate son [[Hornswoggle]]. Foley then made an appearance on ''SmackDown'' the same week, where he defeated Coachman with Hornswoggle as the special guest referee. On the January 7, 2008 episode of ''Raw'', Foley and his tag team partner Hornswoggle qualified for the [[Royal Rumble (2008)|Royal Rumble]] by defeating [[The Highlanders (professional wrestling)|The Highlanders]], but Foley was eliminated by Triple H during the Royal Rumble match.\n\nFoley debuted as a color commentator for SmackDown alongside [[Michael Cole (wrestling)|Michael Cole]] at [[Backlash (2008)|Backlash]] in 2008, replacing [[Jonathan Coachman]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/backlash/exclusives/foleybacklash|title=Foley joins Smackdown! broadcast team|accessdate=April 27, 2008|date=April 27, 2008 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080430135314/http://www.wwe.com/shows/backlash/exclusives/foleybacklash <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = April 30, 2008}}</ref> On the edition of August 1 of ''SmackDown'', Foley was [[kayfabe]] attacked by Edge during Edge's promo for his [[SummerSlam (2008)|SummerSlam]] match against [[The Undertaker]]. Foley sat out the August 8 ''SmackDown'' to sell his recovery from the injuries. Tazz filled in for Foley as a color commentator on ''SmackDown'', while Raw wrestler [[Matt Striker]] filled in for Tazz on ''[[ECW (WWE)|ECW]]''. Foley told Long Island Press pro wrestling columnist Josh Stewart in August 2008 that \"creatively, the announcing job wasn't working out too well\". He expanded with Dave Meltzer on the Observer radio show that the environment was creatively frustrating. Foley allowed his contract with WWE to expire on September 1, 2008, and quietly left the company.\n\n=== Total Nonstop Action Wrestling ===\n==== Championship reigns (2008\u20132009) ====\n[[File:TNA Bound to Glory IV (93 of 136).jpg|thumb|right|Foley at [[Bound for Glory IV]]]]\nOn September 3, 2008, Foley's agency, Gillespie Talent, issued a press release that stated Foley had signed a short-term deal with [[Total Nonstop Action Wrestling]] (TNA).

Two weeks later, Foley made his full television debut in a promo making comments about the [[List of WWE personnel|WWE roster]], Vince McMahon and [[Kurt Angle]]. At [[Bound for Glory IV]], he was the special guest enforcer for Jarrett and Angle's match. Later, on ''Impact!'', Foley said goodbye, but was then approached by Jeff Jarrett with a new offer; he later indicated that they had come to terms on a new contract and would make a major announcement the next week. On the October 23 episode of ''Impact!'', Foley announced that he was now co-owner of TNA along with Jarrett, just after Kurt Angle headbutted him.\n\nOn November 27, Thanksgiving Day, TNA presented the Turkey Bowl. [[Alex Shelley]] ended up being pinned by [[Rhino (wrestler)|Rhino]], and Foley handed Rhino the check. Afterwards, the defeated Shelley had to put on a Turkey Suit in compliance with the match rules, albeit with much refusal. However, Shelley \"[[Finger (gesture)|flipped off]]\" Foley and proceeded to beat him up. In the aftermath, Mick mentioned that Shelley is lucky he still has his job. [[The Main Event Mafia]]'s [[Kevin Nash]], [[Booker T (wrestler)|Booker T]], and [[Scott Steiner]] were going to take on [[D-Von Dudley|Brother Devon]], [[A.J.

Foley got the pin when he hit Scott Steiner with a double arm DDT onto a chair.\n\nOn April 19, 2009 at [[Lockdown (2009)|Lockdown]], he defeated [[Sting (wrestler)|Sting]] to win the [[TNA World Heavyweight Championship]] for his first-ever championship in TNA, and his fourth World title overall. Mick did not lose the championship, but Sting became the new leader of the Main Event Mafia by pinning Kurt Angle at [[Sacrifice (2009)|Sacrifice]]. Foley had also stated on ''[[TNA Impact!|Impact!]]'' tapings that if he retained the TNA World Heavyweight Title at the [[King of the Mountain match]] at [[Slammiversary (2009)|Slammiversary]], he would only put the title up in a match once a year. However, he lost the title to Kurt Angle in the King of The Mountain match at Slammiversary. He received a rematch at [[Victory Road (2009)|Victory Road]], commenting he had only submitted once in his career (to Terry Funk, in a [[Professional wrestling holds#Spinning toe hold|spinning toe hold]]) and swore he'd never do it again. He lost the match when Angle forced him to submit again with the [[ankle lock]].\n\nOn July 30, 2009, the 200th episode of ''Impact!'', Foley won the [[TNA Global Championship|TNA Legends Championship]] by pinning champion Kevin Nash in a tag team match where Nash teamed with Angle and Foley with [[Bobby Lashley]].

One of Foley's first decisions as Raw General Manager was pitting the feuding [[Sheamus]] and [[Cesaro (wrestler)|Cesaro]] against one another in a Best of 7 series. Going into [[WWE Clash of Champions|Clash of Champions]] the duo were tied 3-3. At Clash of Champions, both men would be counted out resulting in a draw and the best of seven series being declared a draw. On the next night's episode of ''Raw'' Foley who had promised the victor a championship opportunity would put the two in a tag team. They would later lose to The New Day in a WWE Tag Team Championship match before going on to capture the RAW Tag Team Championships against the New Day at the Roadblock: End of the Line pay-per-view. On the November 21 episode of ''Raw'', Foley would place [[Sami Zayn]] in a match against [[Braun Strowman]] after Zayn failed to defeat [[The Miz]] at [[Survivor Series (2016)|Survivor Series]] for the [[WWE Intercontinental Championship]] to bring the title to ''Raw''. During the match, Foley would order the match to be stopped, deeming Zayn unable to continue. The following week on ''Raw'', Zayn would demand a rematch against Strowman, but Foley would decline, telling Zayn he could not beat him, making Zayn storm off in anger. On the December 12 episode of ''Raw'', Zayn would once again ask for a rematch with Strowman but was once again rejected by Foley. Zayn would then tell Foley he was pondering going to ''[[WWE SmackDown|SmackDown]]'' because Foley did not believe in him. Later that night, after Zayn defeated [[Jinder Mahal]], Foley would tell him he has arranged a trade with ''SmackDown'' for him in exchange for [[Eva Marie]]. Zayn would angrily refuse the trade and once again demanded a rematch with Strowman. Foley would yield, giving Zayn his match with Strowman at [[Roadblock: End of the Line]] with a ten-minute time limit.\n\nOn the March 13, 2017 episode of ''Raw'', Stephanie McMahon forced Foley to fire a member of the ''Raw'' roster by the end of the night. Foley chose to fire Stephanie McMahon herself, which prompted [[Triple H]] to come out and confront Foley. After being insulted and ordered to leave the ring, Foley instead attacked Triple H, stuffing a sock in Triple H's mouth via ''Mr. Socko'' before being low blowed by McMahon. [[Seth Rollins]] would then come out to aid Foley, only to be attacked by Triple H. On the March 20 episode of ''Raw'', Stephanie McMahon would fire Foley for his actions the previous week. A few weeks later Foley made an appearance at the WWE Hall of Fame [[WWE Hall of Fame (2017)|class of 2017]] ceremony.\n\n====Return to Raw (2018\u2013present)====\nOn the September 10, 2018 episode of ''Raw''.

He unveiled the [[WWE 24/7 Championship|24/7 Championship]] announcing a scramble for the title. In July, he announced that he wanted to challenge R-Truth for the championship.

Wilson], Andrzej Kilian, Chris A. Fields and Sujata Lakhani.  Jefferson describes his vision to found a non-profit organisation in ''Innovations'',<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Jefferson|first=Richard|date=2006-10-01|title=Science as Social Enterprise: The CAMBIA BiOS Initiative|journal=Innovations: Technology, Governance, Globalization|volume=1|issue=4|pages=13\u201344|doi=10.1162/itgg.2006.1.4.13|issn=1558-2477}}</ref> to provide more efficient and effective tools to solve the problems of agriculture and society.\n\nIn 1992, Cambia relocated to [[Canberra]], [[Australia]] from The Netherlands, to oversee and troubleshoot the [[Rockefeller Foundation]]'s [[rice]] biotechnology network in Asia. During this time, Jefferson, Wilson and the growing Cambia team visited hundreds of laboratories to help develop, improve, and apply biotechnology capabilities, particularly pertaining to rice. Cambia offered scientific courses and workshops, and increasing assistance in [[Intellectual Property]] management.   Cambia's ethic was influenced by Jefferson's early years in enabling technology invention and distribution, but greatly refined through increasing awareness of socially and scientifically complex systems and using new thinking about biological evolution (including the [[Hologenome theory of evolution|Hologenome Theory of Evolution]]) as models for institution building and collaboration.\n\nCambia became one of the first social enterprises to use a hybrid licensing model to fund its public good activities.  By selectively patenting important technologies, then creating tiered licensing models for their use, Cambia was able to ensure all parties fair access, but larger licensees would be required to pay more for their non-exclusive use, thus subsidising new developments and distribution and support to less wealthy users, including small enterprises and the public sector in the developing world.  This model - developed also by the social entrepreneur [[David Green (social entrepreneur)|David Green]] for universal access to eye care - is now becoming a pillar of social enterprise function.\n\nOver time Cambia's focus moved away from biotechnology and towards innovation systems and Intellectual Property.   The Patent Lens and its successor [http://lens.org The Lens] are now the primary focus of Cambia. Cambia's goal has always been to enable and democratise innovation and their move towards free and open tools that help people understand intellectual property landscapes is a continuation of those values. In this way they have changed from a wet-science research institute into a strategic system-changing social enterprise.  In 2012 and 2013, Cambia was rated among the top 100 best NGOs globally by [[The Global Journal]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://theglobaljournal.net/article/view/534/|title=#86 - Cambia {{!}} The Global Journal|website=theglobaljournal.net|access-date=2019-02-06}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://theglobaljournal.net/article/view/585/|title=The Top 100 NGOs 2013 {{!}} The Global Journal|website=theglobaljournal.net|access-date=2019-02-06}}</ref>\n\n==Projects==\nCambia's work to freely distribute scientific tools and techniques gave rise to the [[Biological Innovation for Open Society|Biological Open Source (BiOS)]] Initiative in 2005. Through an open-source biotechnology license and [[Material Transfer Agreement]] (MTA) developed in 2005-2007, BiOS sought to establish [[freedom to operate]] for innovators by providing and exemplifying legal instruments by which innovators could collaboratively use intellectual property protection as a means to share and jointly improve technology for wider utility.

Its projects include the [[Patent Lens]], its successor [http://www.lens.org The Lens],  and the [[Biological Innovation for Open Society]] Initiative.\n\nCambia derives its name from the [[Spanish language|Spanish]] [[verb]] ''cambiar'', to change.<ref>https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/cambiar</ref>\n\n==History==\nCambia was established in 1992 by [[Richard Anthony Jefferson]], a leading molecular biologist responsible for the invention of the [[GUS reporter system]], with substantial early participation by Steven G Hughes, [https://www.linkedin.com/pub/kate-wilson/27/41a/275 Kate J. Wilson], Andrzej Kilian, Chris A. Fields and Sujata Lakhani.  Jefferson describes his vision to found a non-profit organisation in ''Innovations'',<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Jefferson|first=Richard|date=2006-10-01|title=Science as Social Enterprise: The CAMBIA BiOS Initiative|journal=Innovations: Technology, Governance, Globalization|volume=1|issue=4|pages=13\u201344|doi=10.1162/itgg.2006.1.4.13|issn=1558-2477}}</ref> to provide more efficient and effective tools to solve the problems of agriculture and society.\n\nIn 1992, Cambia relocated to [[Canberra]], [[Australia]] from The Netherlands, to oversee and troubleshoot the [[Rockefeller Foundation]]'s [[rice]] biotechnology network in Asia. During this time, Jefferson, Wilson and the growing Cambia team visited hundreds of laboratories to help develop, improve, and apply biotechnology capabilities, particularly pertaining to rice. Cambia offered scientific courses and workshops, and increasing assistance in [[Intellectual Property]] management.   Cambia's ethic was influenced by Jefferson's early years in enabling technology invention and distribution, but greatly refined through increasing awareness of socially and scientifically complex systems and using new thinking about biological evolution (including the [[Hologenome theory of evolution|Hologenome Theory of Evolution]]) as models for institution building and collaboration.\n\nCambia became one of the first social enterprises to use a hybrid licensing model to fund its public good activities.  By selectively patenting important technologies, then creating tiered licensing models for their use, Cambia was able to ensure all parties fair access, but larger licensees would be required to pay more for their non-exclusive use, thus subsidising new developments and distribution and support to less wealthy users, including small enterprises and the public sector in the developing world.  This model - developed also by the social entrepreneur [[David Green (social entrepreneur)|David Green]] for universal access to eye care - is now becoming a pillar of social enterprise function.\n\nOver time Cambia's focus moved away from biotechnology and towards innovation systems and Intellectual Property.   The Patent Lens and its successor [http://lens.org The Lens] are now the primary focus of Cambia. Cambia's goal has always been to enable and democratise innovation and their move towards free and open tools that help people understand intellectual property landscapes is a continuation of those values. In this way they have changed from a wet-science research institute into a strategic system-changing social enterprise.  In 2012 and 2013, Cambia was rated among the top 100 best NGOs globally by [[The Global Journal]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://theglobaljournal.net/article/view/534/|title=#86 - Cambia {{!}} The Global Journal|website=theglobaljournal.net|access-date=2019-02-06}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://theglobaljournal.net/article/view/585/|title=The Top 100 NGOs 2013 {{!}} The Global Journal|website=theglobaljournal.net|access-date=2019-02-06}}</ref>\n\n==Projects==\nCambia's work to freely distribute scientific tools and techniques gave rise to the [[Biological Innovation for Open Society|Biological Open Source (BiOS)]] Initiative in 2005. Through an open-source biotechnology license and [[Material Transfer Agreement]] (MTA) developed in 2005-2007, BiOS sought to establish [[freedom to operate]] for innovators by providing and exemplifying legal instruments by which innovators could collaboratively use intellectual property protection as a means to share and jointly improve technology for wider utility. BiOS was built on the back of Jefferson's invention of the GUS-based reporter system and the creation of TransBacter,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bios.net/daisy/cambia-old/3586.html |title=TransBacter Project |accessdate=2019-02-12 }}</ref> a work-around for the creation of transgenic plants bypassing the highly patented [[Agrobacterium]] genus.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Gene transfer to plants by diverse species of bacteria|journal=Nature|date=2005-02-10|first=Wim|last=Broothaerts|author2=Heidi J.

The Wolfpack also appeared in the Final Four of the 1947 [[National Invitational Tournament]], which was during the NIT's \"national championship era.\"\n\nNC State achieved its 1700th overall win against Presbyterian College, 86-68, becoming the 26th NCAA school to reach such an achievement.<ref name=\"sports-reference.com\"/>\n\n===The early years (1910\u20131945)===\nIn 1910 Guy Bryan formed a special committee that proposed to the university administration the organization of the school's first basketball team.<ref name=\"media-guide-101\">Media Guide, p. 101</ref> The program played its first official intercollegiate basketball game on February 16, 1911 against a much more experienced squad from [[Wake Forest Demon Deacons men's basketball|Wake Forest]].

The following year, the school's athletics council officially recognized basketball as a sport.<ref name=\"media-guide-101\"/>\n\nBefore the 1920\u201321 season the university changed its name from North Carolina A&M to North Carolina State College. At that time the school's nickname was the \"Tech.\"<ref name=\"media-guide-101\"/> That season the program joined the fledgling [[Southern Conference]] as a charter member.<ref name=\"packpride\">{{cite web|last=Crawford|first=Jacob|title=Complete History of NC State Basketball|url=http://northcarolinastate.scout.com/2/209048.html|publisher=Pack Pride|date=2003-12-26|accessdate=2008-06-30|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090517115139/http://northcarolinastate.scout.com/2/209048.html|archivedate=2009-05-17}}</ref> State College changed its nickname yet again in 1923, this time to the \"Red Terrors.\" The name was drawn from a combination of the play of Rochelle \"Red\" Johnson and the team's new bright red road uniforms. Also in 1923, State opened its first basketball facility, Frank Thompson Gym. The gym, named in honor of a former athlete from the school who died in action during [[World War I]], served as the team's home until 1948.<ref name=\"media-guide-101\"/> During the first years of the program, the team had no practice facility and was forced to practice on an outdoor field in nearby [[Pullen Park]].<ref>Chapelow ''Raleigh's Reynolds Coliseum'', p.34</ref>\n\nGus Tebell took over the basketball team as head coach in 1924. During his tenure he led the program to a number of school firsts, including the first conference championship in 1929 and the first 20-win season. He compiled a then all-time program best career coaching record at 79\u201336. The Wolfpack's first player to garner significant national recognition was Bud Rose, who, after the 1931\u201332 season, was named as an honorable mention All-American.<ref name=\"media-guide-101\"/>\n\nIn 1941 the university began construction on [[Reynolds Coliseum|William Neal Reynolds Coliseum]], a multi-purpose arena that would serve as the new home of Wolfpack basketball. Construction was stalled due to the involvement of the United States in [[World War II]], and the skeleton structure of the arena was left unfinished for nearly six years until its completion in 1949. The Wolfpack would play its home games at Reynolds for the next 50 years, until the men's team moved to [[PNC Arena]] in 1999.\n\n===Everett Case era (1946\u20131965)===\nFollowing the end of World War II, chancellor [[John W. Harrelson]] and athletic director H.A. Fisher set upon rebuilding the university's athletic teams. In 1946 David Clark, a former president of the NC State Alumni Association, suggested to the Athletics Council that the best place to search for a new head basketball coach would be in Indiana, which was a basketball hotbed at the time. Per Clark's suggestion, Harrelson and his father Stejem Mark met with Indiana native [[Chuck Taylor (salesman)|Chuck Taylor]] who was in Raleigh to coach his army team in an exhibition game against NC State. Taylor's recommendation for the job was his former high school coach [[Everett Case]].<ref name=\"Chapelow-34\">Chappelow ''Raleigh's Reynolds Coliseum, p.34</ref> When approached by Harrelson about the job, Case was at first hesitant because of the tight restrictions under which the program had been operating. Harrelson assured Case that he would be given an expanded budget and more than enough scholarships to field a competitive team. Additionally, Case was lured by the still unfinished Reynolds Coliseum. He accepted the job almost immediately without ever visiting the campus.<ref name=\"Menzer-30\">Menzer ''Four Corners'', p.30</ref>\n\n====Six consecutive Southern Conference titles====\n\nEverett Case was named head coach on July 1, 1946. Case had previously coached high school basketball in Indiana, where in 23 seasons he compiled a 726\u201375 record and won four state championships at Frankfort, High School.<ref name=\"ID-HOF\">{{cite web|title=Indiana Basketball Hall of Fame: Everett Case|url=http://www.hoopshall.com/inductees/1968/case.html|accessdate=2008-07-08}}</ref> Before arriving at NC State, he spent two years as an assistant coach at the [[University of Southern California]] and spent several years coaching teams at various Naval bases during the war.<ref name=\"Menzer-29\">Menzer ''Four Corners'', p.29</ref> In February 1947, his first season at NC State, Case defeated [[North Carolina Tar Heels men's basketball|North Carolina]] in Chapel Hill, 48\u201346 in overtime, beginning a streak of 15 consecutive victories over the Tar Heels. Later that month, an afternoon game in Thompson Gym against [[Duke Blue Devils men's basketball|Duke]] was postponed by city fire officials because of overcrowding. That evening the game was officially canceled after fans were found sneaking through bathroom windows, breaking down doors, and hiding in the basement.<ref name=\"media-guide-102\">Media Guide, p. 102</ref> Less than three weeks later, Case guided the Red Terrors to their first Southern Conference championship in 18 years. Case and his team celebrated by performing an Indiana high school tradition of cutting down the nets. The tradition soon spread to college teams across the nation and survives amongst championship teams to this day.<ref name=\"nets\">{{cite web|title=Cutting down the nets part of winning fabric|url=https://www.usatoday.com/sports/college/mensbasketball/tourney05/2005-03-23-trimming-nets_x.htm|last=Gluskin|first=Michael|publisher=USA Today|date=2005-03-23|accessdate=2008-06-30}}</ref> Soon after his arrival, Case was named \"Tar Heel of the Week\" by the Raleigh ''[[News and Observer]]'', citing that \"since the little man came here from Indiana...basketball has almost supplanted politics as the favorite topic of discussion in the North Carolina capital.\"<ref name=\"Grundy-196\">Grundy ''Learning to Win'', p.196</ref> In Case's second season as head coach the team changed its nickname from the Red Terrors to the Wolfpack.<ref name=\"media-guide-102\"/>\n\nIn February 1948, Case made alterations to the design of the still incomplete Reynolds Coliseum. Attempting to usurp [[Duke University|Duke]]'s [[Cameron Indoor Stadium]] as the largest basketball arena in the area,<ref name=\"packpride\"/> Case insisted that the blueprints be changed to increase the maximum capacity from 9,000 seats to 12,400. Construction resumed later that month after a final shipment of steel arrived in Raleigh.<ref name=\"media-guide-102\"/> Reynolds officially opened its doors on December 2, 1949, with a Wolfpack win over Washington & Lee, 67\u201347, in front of a crowd of 11,020.<ref name=\"Chappelow-59\">Chappelow ''Raleigh's Reynolds Coliseum'', p.59</ref> At that time, the arena was the largest college basketball facility in the southeast.<ref name=\"media-guide-102\"/> Soon after Reynolds' opening, the ''[[Greensboro News & Record]]'' wrote that Raleigh had become \"the basketball capital of the world.

The Dixie Classic was a three-day tournament held each December until 1961 that matched the four [[Tobacco Road (rivalry)|Tobacco Road]] schools of NC State, North Carolina, Duke, and Wake Forest against four of the top teams from across the country. In its time the Dixie Classic became the largest regular season tournament in college basketball.<ref>{{cite web|last=Carr |first=A.J. |title=Dixie Classic scandal left bad taste |url=http://www.newsobserver.com/122/story/418466.html |publisher=News & Observer |date=2006-03-16 |accessdate=2008-06-30 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070312223301/http://www.newsobserver.com/122/story/418466.html |archivedate=March 12, 2007 }}</ref> After finishing the season at 27\u20136 and winning its fourth consecutive Southern Conference Tournament, the Wolfpack received invitations to both the [[National Invitation Tournament]] and the [[NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament]].

NC State went on to defeat [[Baylor Bears men's basketball|Baylor]] in the third-place game, 53\u201341.<ref name=\"media-guide-102\"/> The Wolfpack won its fifth consecutive Southern Conference title in 1951 and its sixth the following year. Both seasons ended in early exits from the NCAA Tournament, though. In 1951 State defeated [[Villanova Wildcats men's basketball|Villanova]] in the first round before losing to [[Illinois Fighting Illini men's basketball|Illinois]]. In 1952 the team lost in the first round to [[St. John's Red Storm men's basketball|St. John's]] and future North Carolina head coach [[Frank McGuire]].\n\nThe Wolfpack's six-year winning streak against North Carolina came to an end in January 1953, as the Wolfpack, ranked #17 in the country, lost to the unranked Tar Heels in Raleigh, 70\u201369.<ref>{{cite web|title=AP Ranking for Wednesday, January 2, 1952|url=http://www.sportsstats.com/AP/Ranking/19520102.html|publisher=SportStats.com|accessdate=2008-07-06}}</ref> It was the first match between the two schools since the hiring of Frank \"the man\" McGuire the previous summer. McGuire inflamed NC State players and fans by having his players cut down the nets in Reynolds Coliseum following the victory.<ref name=\"media-guide-102\"/> Despite the loss, the Pack finished first in the conference at 13\u20133 but lost in the conference tournament championship game. The team was ranked 18th in the final AP poll of 1953 but was left out of the NCAA Tournament for the first time in four years.\n\n====The move to the ACC====\n\nBy the end of the 1952\u201353 season the Southern Conference had bloated to 17 members and was still seen as a football-centric conference. Maryland and Duke had become national football powers and there weren't many schools in the conference that could regularly compete against them. In an effort to create a more balanced round-robin schedule and thus secure an automatic bid to the [[Orange Bowl (game)|Orange Bowl]], the top eight football schools from the conference\u2014Maryland, Duke, UNC, Virginia, South Carolina, Clemson, Wake Forest, and NC State\u2014left to form the [[Atlantic Coast Conference]].<ref name=\"Menzer-43-44\">Menzer ''Four Corners'', p.43\u201344</ref>\n\nNC State's first ACC contest was on the road against Wake Forest in December 1953. The Wolfpack was ranked #8 in the nation at the time, but just as in the first ever meeting between the two schools, Wake Forest prevailed. Case and his squad defeated the Demon Deacons later that season in the first-ever ACC Tournament championship game, 82\u201380 in overtime. The victory meant a return trip to the [[1954 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|NCAA Tournament]], where NC State defeated George Washington in the first round before losing to eventual champion La Salle in the second round. Case's squad won a second ACC title the following year, defeating Duke in 87\u201377 in the championship game. The team finished with a 28\u20134 record but was ineligible for postseason play; earlier in the season the NCAA imposed four years' probation and banned them from postseason play during that time for numerous recruiting violations.<ref>[https://web1.ncaa.org/LSDBi/exec/miSearch?miSearchSubmit=publicReport&key=29&publicTerms=THIS%20PHRASE%20WILL%20NOT%20BE%20REPEATED 1956 infraction report]</ref> The Wolfpack brought home a third consecutive ACC title in the 1955\u201356 season, setting a record for consecutive ACC championships that stood until 2002. The team also played in its first televised game earlier that season, losing to North Carolina in Chapel Hill, 73\u201369.<ref name=\"media-guide-102\"/> State struggled in the 1956\u201357 season, finishing fifth in the conference for the first time under Case.  State's loss in the first round of that year's [[1957 ACC Men's Basketball Tournament|ACC Tournament]] also marked the first time that Case did not lead his team to the conference championship game. To add insult to injury, bitter rival North Carolina brought the ACC its first national championship.  The team finished third in 1958 and was ranked 20th in the nation at the season's end but again lost early in the [[1958 ACC Men's Basketball Tournament|ACC Tournament]], this time to North Carolina in the quarterfinals.\n\nThe 1958 Dixie Classic brought to Reynolds Coliseum some of the most talented teams ever assembled for the tournament. Included in the field were eight players who eventually earned All-American honors, including NC State's [[Lou Pucillo]] and [[John Richter]], North Carolina's Lee Shaffer, York Larese, and Doug Moe, [[Cincinnati Bearcats men's basketball|Cincinnati]]'s [[Oscar Robertson]], [[Michigan State Spartans men's basketball|Michigan State]]'s [[Johnny Green (basketball)|Johnny Green]], and [[Louisville Cardinals men's basketball|Louisville]]'s [[Don Goldstein]]. Later that season, NC State, ranked #10 in the nation, defeated North Carolina, ranked #5, 80\u201356 to win their fourth ACC championship in six seasons.  However, due to the 1956 sanctions, they were ineligible for the NCAA Tournament. The Pack finished the season ranked #6 with a 22\u20134 record.<ref name=\"media-guide-102\"/>\n\n====Case's final years====\nThe 1959\u201360 Wolfpack team finished with an 11\u201315 record, marking Case's first losing season in Raleigh. The team finished fourth in the ACC in 1961 and third in 1962 but lost in the first round of the conference tournament both seasons. In the summer of 1962, Case, then 62 years old, hired his former player and then Clemson head coach [[Press Maravich]] to be his top assistant. Case's health began to deteriorate rapidly over the following two seasons as the Wolfpack finished fifth in the ACC in 1963 and seventh in 1964. The seventh-place finish was the lowest of Case's tenure and would prove to be his last. On December 7, 1964, just two games into the season, Everett Case retired and named Maravich as his successor.<ref name=\"media-guide-102\"/> During his tenure, Case won six Southern Conference titles, four ACC titles, and qualified for the NCAA Tournament twice. His overall record of 377\u2013134 remains the best in NC State history.{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}}\n\nMaravich led the Pack to second-place finish in the conference and an ACC championship, its first in six years.

On April 30, 1966, the day after Maravich announced that he was leaving, Everett Case died while in a Raleigh hospital.\n\n===Norm Sloan era (1967\u20131980)===\nJust a week after Maravich's exit, former Wolfpack basketball and football player [[Norm Sloan]] was hired as the new head coach. In 1967\u201368, his first season, Sloan's team finished the regular season third in the ACC with a 9\u20135 conference record.<ref name=\"media-guide-103\">Media Guide, p. 103</ref> State made it as far as the ACC championship game before losing to North Carolina 87\u201350, but it was the Pack's semifinal game against tenth-ranked Duke that is most remembered. Sloan realized that his team was vastly undersized against the Blue Devils. He decided, however, to use the Wolfpack's quickness to its advantage and keep the ball away from the Duke players for as much of the game as possible. Using a tactic he coined \"stall-ball,\" Sloan instructed his players to hold the ball at halfcourt and slow the game down as much as possible. The final result was the lowest scoring game in ACC Tournament history. Duke led 4\u20132 at halftime and the Wolfpack held the ball for more than 13 straight minutes in the second half.

The team finished the regular season at 23\u20137 overall and third in the conference. In the conference championship game, the Pack defeated third-ranked [[South Carolina Gamecocks men's basketball|South Carolina]] 42\u201339 in double overtime.<ref name=\"media-guide-103\"/> With the victory, the Wolfpack was invited to its first NCAA Tournament in five years. State received a bye in the first round of the tournament and lost its first game to St. Bonaventure in the semifinals, 80\u201368. In the Eastern Regional third-place game, the Pack defeated Niagara, 108\u201388. Despite State's quick exit from the tournament, Sloan's squad finished the season ranked tenth in the AP poll, its first end-of-the-season ranking since being ranked sixth following the 1958\u201359 season.\n\nDuring the spring of 1970, just after the season's end, Sloan signed [[Tom Burleson]]. Burleson, a 7'4\" native of [[Newland, NC]], was the first major player of the Wolfpack squad that would have a combined record of 57\u20131 during the 1972\u201373 and 1973\u201374 seasons to be signed. The following spring, Sloan signed the remaining pieces of the 1974 championship nucleus, 6'4\" [[David Thompson (basketball)|David Thompson]], 5'7\" point guard [[Monte Towe]], and 6'7\" power forward [[Tim Stoddard]].<ref name=\"media-guide-103\"/> At the time, the NCAA prohibited freshmen from competing on varsity squads and the team struggled in the following two seasons, finishing seventh in the ACC in 1970\u201371 and fifth in 1971\u201372. At 13\u201314 overall, the 1970\u201371 season was Sloan's worst and his only losing season as the Wolfpack head coach.\n\nWith the addition of Thompson, Towe, and Stoddard to the starting lineup in 1972\u201373, the team rebounded quickly from its recent struggles.

Ranked second nationally in the first AP poll of the season,<ref>{{cite web|title=AP History of North Carolina State|url=http://www.sportsstats.com/AP/NorthCarolinaState.html|publisher=SportsStats.com|accessdate=2008-07-09}}</ref> the team was poised to make another strong run. State began the season with a pair of games against [[East Carolina Pirates men's basketball|East Carolina]] and [[Vermont Catamounts men's basketball|Vermont]], which it won by a combined score of 176\u201387. The third game of the season was against seven-time defending national champions [[UCLA Bruins men's basketball|UCLA]] and coach [[John Wooden]]. The Pack came out sluggish and was easily defeated, 84\u201366. It would prove to be the team's only loss in two seasons, though, as the Pack tore through the ACC, finishing the regular season at 24\u20131 overall.<ref name=\"sportsstats-sched\">{{cite web|title=NC State Schedule and Results|url=http://www.sportsstats.com/bball/game.results/NCSU|publisher=SportsStats.com|accessdate=2008-07-09}}</ref> As the team continued to rack up victories, its national ranking rose accordingly. On February 19, with just four regular season games remaining, NC State overtook UCLA for the top spot in the AP poll; it was the program's first ever #1 ranking.{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}}\n\nAs the top seed in the conference tournament, the Wolfpack received a bye in the first round. In the semifinals State easily defeated Virginia, 87\u201366. In the championship game the team faced off against fourth-ranked Maryland, which had lost by only six points in each of the teams' regular season meetings. Maryland jumped to an early 25\u201312 lead, hitting 12 of its first 14 shots. The Wolfpack cut the deficit to five points at halftime, but momentum shifted throughout the second half. NC State led by four late in the game, but Maryland closed the gap and sent the game to overtime, tied at 97. The Wolfpack, led by Tom Burleson's 38 points, won 103\u2013100 in what has been heralded as one of the greatest college basketball games ever played.<ref name=\"greatest-game\">{{cite web|title=College basketball's greatest games|url=http://espn.go.com/endofcentury/s/games/ncb.html|publisher=ESPN.com|date=1999-12-27|accessdate=2008-06-30}}</ref><ref name=\"media-guide-107\">Media Guide, p. 107</ref>\n\nBack in the NCAA Tournament for the first time in four seasons, Sloan and his team played their first two games on their home court. They defeated their first two opponents, Providence and Pittsburgh, by a combined 32 points to set up a Final Four rematch with UCLA. In the week leading up to the game, thousands of fans packed Reynolds Coliseum to watch the Wolfpack practice. When the two teams finally met in [[Greensboro, NC|Greensboro]], it was another tight contest for the Pack. After ending regulation tied at 65, each team scored only two points in the first overtime. UCLA took a seven-point lead in the second extra period, but NC State led by David Thompson, took the lead for the final time with 34 seconds to play. State went on to win, 80\u201377, and advanced to the national championship game against [[Marquette Golden Eagles men's basketball|Marquette]].<ref name=\"media-guide-109\">Media Guide, p. 109</ref>\n\nThe championship game, played two nights later, was much less competitive than the previous contest. The game was close in the first half until Marquette coach [[Al McGuire]] received two technical fouls and was ejected from the game. McGuire's exit sparked a 10\u20130 Wolfpack run just before halftime. NC State led by as much as 19 points in the second half and ultimately won, 76\u201364.<ref name=\"media-guide-109\"/>\n\nThompson left NC State after his senior season in 1975 as the school's most decorated player. He won every major national player of the year award in 1975, in addition to being a three-time consensus First-Team All-America honoree, a three-time unanimous First-Team All-ACC honoree, and a three-time ACC Player of the Year winner.<ref name=\"award-winners\">{{cite web|title=ACC Award Winners 1954\u20132002|url=http://www.sportsstats.com/bball/awards/index.html|publisher=Charlie Board's ACC Stats Archive|accessdate=2008-06-30}}</ref> In his 86 games, Thompson scored 2,309 points (26.8 ppg);<ref name=\"Thompson-stats\">{{cite web|title=David Thompson individual stats|url=http://www.sportsstats.com/bball/individual.stats/player_stats/player1864.txt|publisher=Charlie Board's ACC Stats Archive|accessdate=2008-06-30}}</ref> he still holds the Wolfpack records for points scored in a single season (838 in 1974\u201375) and points scored in a single game (57 in 1974).

His last team (1979\u201380) team reached the NCAA Tournament, losing to Iowa in the second round. Also, twice during his final six seasons in Raleigh his teams played in the [[National Invitation Tournament|NIT]]. In 1976, the Pack advanced to the [[1976 National Invitation Tournament|semifinals]] and in 1978, it defeated [[South Carolina Gamecocks men's basketball|South Carolina]], Detroit, and [[Georgetown Hoyas men's basketball|Georgetown]] before falling to [[Texas Longhorns men's basketball|Texas]] in the [[1978 National Invitation Tournament|championship game]]. In his final season, he led the program to its 1000th victory.

Whittenburg returned to the court in time for the [[1983 ACC Men's Basketball Tournament|ACC Tournament]], which most believed the Pack needed to win in order to secure a second consecutive berth in the NCAA Tournament. State did just that, defeating heavily favored North Carolina and [[Virginia Cavaliers men's basketball|Virginia]] squads led by [[Michael Jordan]] and [[Ralph Sampson]], respectively. The Wolfpack kept winning. Their close games and exciting finishes in the ACC Tournament and early rounds of the NCAA tournament earned them the moniker The Cardiac Pack.  As a #6 seed in the [[1983 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|NCAA Tournament]], the Wolfpack won narrow victories over Pepperdine (in double overtime) and UNLV (71\u201370) before defeating [[Utah Utes men's basketball|Utah]] in the Sweet Sixteen, 75\u201356. In the regional final, NC State again defeated Virginia, 63\u201362, then defeated [[Georgia Bulldogs men's basketball|Georgia]] in the Final Four to advance to the championship game against [[Houston Cougars men's basketball|Houston]]. The Cougars, nicknamed [[Phi Slama Jama]] for their athletic, fast-paced style of play that featured [[Clyde Drexler]] and [[Hakeem Olajuwon]], were expected to win easily over the underdog Wolfpack. NC State escaped with their second national title after a last-second air ball by Dereck Whittenburg was caught and dunked by [[Lorenzo Charles]].<ref name=\"packpride\"/> The 54\u201352 final is one of the most famous in college basketball history.[https://www.usatoday.com/sports/college/basketball/men/02tourney/greatest-games.htm]\n\nValvano's 1984 team finished 7th in the ACC and lost in the first round of the [[1984 National Invitation Tournament|NIT]] to future conference foe [[Florida State Seminoles men's basketball|Florida State]]. The following season, with the addition of guard [[Vinny Del Negro]], the Pack began a run of five consecutive trips to the NCAA Tournament. The Pack reached the Elite Eight in [[1985 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|1985]] and [[1986 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|1986]] and the Sweet Sixteen in [[1989 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|1989]]. In 1987, after a sixth-place finish in the regular season, NC State made another surprising run through the [[1987 ACC Men's Basketball Tournament|ACC Tournament]]. In the championship game, State defeated rival North Carolina, which had gone undefeated in conference play. It was the program's last ACC championship to date. State finished second in the conference the following year and was a #3 seed in the [[1988 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|NCAA Tournament]]. The team made an early exit, though, losing to #14 seed [[Murray State Racers men's basketball|Murray State]] in the first round.<ref name=\"packpride\"/>\n\nValvano's final season in Raleigh was mired in controversy after the release of the book, ''Personal Fouls'', written by Peter Golenbock. In the book, Golenbock alleged improper practices and a lack of institutional control in the NC State athletics department. The allegations included grade fixing, lowered or waived entrance requirements for athletes, the selling of tickets and sneakers by athletes, and frequent drug use by athletes.<ref name=\"personal-fouls\">{{cite web|last=Carroll|first=Kent|title='Personal Fouls' Is Defended|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C0CE2DF1F3DF93BA15752C0A966958260|publisher=New York Times|date=1990-01-28|accessdate=2008-06-30}}</ref> The claims were refuted by Valvano and Chancellor [[Bruce Poulton]], claiming that some of the players might have sold some of their shoes, most notably to ACC superfan Jason Bass. The NCAA investigation, and 5 additional investigations by separate entities found only that players indeed sold shoes and their complimentary game tickets for spending money. Nonetheless, the NCAA banned NC State from postseason play for the 1989-90 season. Earlier, NC State limited itself to only 12 total scholarships for 1990-91 and 1991-92. Although Valvano was not named in the NCAA report at all, new chancellor [[Larry Monteith]] forced his resignation on April 7, 1990.<ref name=\"packpride\"/><ref>[https://web3.ncaa.org/lsdbi/search/miCaseView/report?id=101719 1989 infractions report]</ref>\n\n===Les Robinson era (1990\u20131996)===\nTo replace Valvano, NC State turned to [[East Tennessee State Buccaneers men's basketball|East Tennessee State]] coach [[Les Robinson]], who had played for Case in the 1960s. Robinson was the 1991 District Coach of the Year as selected by the National Association of Basketball Coaches (NABC) after leading NC State to a 20\u201311 record in the first season.  He was the first first-year coach in ACC history to win 20 games, post a winning regular season conference record, and win games in both the ACC and NCAA Tournaments.  The only other coach to pull off this feat is North Carolina's [[Bill Guthridge]].\n\nHowever, the lost scholarships took their full effect a year later, and the Wolfpack plummeted into the ACC's second division for the next five years. The low point of Robinson's tenure at his alma mater came during the 1992\u201393 season. Due to injuries and academic-related suspensions, Robinson was only able to dress seven players for most conference games.  They ultimately finished 8\u201319, the worst record in modern Wolfpack history.\n\nIn 1992 the ACC Tournament was expanded because of the addition of Florida State. A play-in game between the eighth and ninth place teams was created, and during his five years as the N.C. State coach after its addition, Robinson's Wolfpack played in the play-in game four out of five times (finishing seventh in 1992). Because of his team's traditional appearance in the Thursday night play-in game, the game became known as the \"Les Robinson Invitational\" by ACC fans. The play-in game was discontinued when the ACC expanded to include Miami and Virginia Tech, and required three Thursday games. With the later addition of Boston College, there are now four games on Thursday.\n\nLes Robinson would stay on as head coach through the 1995\u201396 season.  While he never tallied another winning record, his stint went a long way towards cleansing the image of the program to both insiders and outsiders.<ref name=\"packpride\"/> Robinson was appointed NC State's athletic director in 1996 and stepped down as head coach. He left to become The Citadel's athletic director in 2000.\n\n===Herb Sendek era (1996\u20132006)===\n[[File:RBC Center.jpg|right|thumb|[[PNC Arena]], which opened in 1999, is the current home of Wolfpack basketball.]]\n[[Herb Sendek|Sendek]] was hired at NC State in 1996 after three years of success at Miami (Ohio), his first head coaching experience. He immediately improved upon the Les Robinson era, winning 17 games for the program's first winning record in six years. In his first year at NC State, the Wolfpack also finished the year winning eight of 11 games, advanced to the finals of the ACC Tournament, and earned a trip to the postseason in the NIT.\n\nSendek coached NC State to the NCAA tournament five consecutive years from 2002 until 2006 (tying the school record). He had his most success during these last five years, winning his 100th game at NC State in 2002 and having a winning conference record in each year but one. In 2004, Sendek won ACC Coach of the Year and Julius Hodge, one of Sendek's most prized recruits during his NC State tenure, won the ACC Men's Basketball Player of the Year. In 2005, NC State upset defending champion Connecticut in the second round of the NCAA tournament to advance to the Sweet Sixteen, NC State's deepest run into the tournament during Sendek's years. Sendek finished his NC State coaching career with a 71\u201388 record in the ACC and a 32\u201387 record against RPI top 50 teams.  On April 3, 2006, Sendek accepted the head coaching job at Arizona State.\n\n===Sidney Lowe era (2006\u20132011)===\n[[Sidney Lowe]] was named head coach in May 2006 after a month-long search that included such targets as [[Rick Barnes]], [[John Beilein]], [[John Calipari]], and [[Steve Lavin]].<ref name=\"lowe-hire\">{{cite web|last=Katz|first=Andy|title=Sources: Pistons' Lowe agrees to coach North Carolina State|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/ncb/news/story?id=2433439|publisher=ESPN.com|date=2006-05-05|accessdate=2008-06-30}}</ref> Lowe's first season got off to a good start as the Wolfpack won its first five games.

He returned to Raleigh in 2006 to replace Herb Sendek as coach, but the Wolfpack struggled to sustain any momentum in Lowe's five seasons. Although he made the NIT twice, he never made the NCAA tournament as a coach, and never finished higher than ninth place in the ACC. He went 86\u201378, including just 25\u201355 in ACC play. Lowe was 3\u201316 record against rivals Duke and North Carolina, with two of those wins coming in his first year.\n\nLowe also spent five years as an NBA head coach in Minnesota and Memphis, compiling a 79\u2013228 record.\n\n===Mark Gottfried era (2011\u20132017)===\n[[Mark Gottfried]] was named head coach on April 5, 2011. In his first season as head coach of NC State, [[Mark Gottfried]] recorded a 22\u201312 overall regular season record, including a 9\u20137 regular season record in the ACC, and reached the semifinals of the ACC tournament. [[Mark Gottfried]] recorded the second best season by a first-year coach at State, second only to [[Everett Case]]. Gottfried's first Wolfpack team earned a #11 seed in the 2012 NCAA Tournament. The Pack won in the tournament over sixth seeded [[San Diego State Aztecs men's basketball|San Diego State]] and third seeded [[Georgetown Hoyas men's basketball|Georgetown]] to advance to the Sweet Sixteen, where it lost to second seeded Kansas. They finished the season ranked #20 in the AP Poll.\n\nEntering the 2012\u201313 season, expectations ran high for Gottfried's second season as head coach. The Wolfpack returned four starters from its 2012 Sweet Sixteen squad and were joined by a trio of talented freshman, each of whom were selected as [[McDonald's All-American Game|McDonald's All Americans]]. As a result, NC State started the season ranked #6 in the AP preseason poll, the Wolfpack's second-highest preseason ranking in program history. Additionally, NC State was voted as preseason favorite to win the ACC title in the conference's annual media survey and the inaugural league coaches\u2019 poll. Ultimately, [[2012\u201313 NC State Wolfpack men's basketball team|the team]] did not live up to media expectations. 24\u201311 overall, The Wolfpack finished tied for fourth in the ACC regular season standings with a 24\u201311 overall record (11\u20137 ACC) and as a #8 seed lost its first game in the second round of the 2013 NCAA tournament to [[2012-13 Temple Owls men's basketball team|Temple]].\n\nMark Gottfried began his third season as head coach of the Wolfpack having lost five of seven players who logged significant minutes (four of which were starters). They struggled for most of the season, finishing 9\u20139 in ACC play. However, the Wolfpack surprised many by making the semifinals of the ACC tournament by upsetting #11 [[2013-14 Syracuse Orange men's basketball team|Syracuse]], who entered the tournament as a second seed. They eventually lost to a third seeded Duke team. They were selected as a #12 seed in the 2014 NCAA tournament, where they won over [[2013-14 Xavier Musketeers men's basketball team|Xavier]] in the First Four before losing in the second round to St. Louis. They finished the season 22\u201314.\n\nComing into Gottfried's fourth season, NC State had lost [[T.J. Warren]], the ACC's leading scorer the previous year, to the NBA draft. They also lost point guard Tyler Lewis, who transferred to [[Butler University|Butler]]. They finished 19\u201312 with a 10\u20138 ACC record. NC State upset [[Jahlil Okafor]] and #2 [[2014-15 Duke Blue Devils men's basketball team|Duke]] on January 11, nearly two years after upsetting them in the same place in 2013. They also upset #15 [[2014-15 North Carolina Tar Heels men's basketball team|UNC]] in the Dean Smith Center for the first time since 2003, holding the Heels to their lowest home point total ever. These two wins, along with wins against [[2014-15 Louisville Cardinals men's basketball team|Louisville]] and [[2014-15 Syracuse Orange men's basketball team|Syracuse]] made Gottfried the first coach to beat all ACC Hall of Fame coaches in the same year. They made it to the quarterfinals of the ACC tournament where they lost to Duke, and were selected as an 8 seed in the NCAA tournament where they made the Sweet Sixteen, upsetting #1 [[2014-15 Villanova Wildcats men's basketball team|Villanova]] along the way.\n\nIn Gottfried's fifth season, NC State lost half of its scoring threat with [[Trevor Lacey]] declaring for the draft and Ralston Turner and Desmond Lee graduating. Additionally, Kyle Washington transferred to the [[University of Cincinnati|Cincinnati]]. NC State suffered a loss in their opening game against [[2015-16 William & Mary Tribe men's basketball team|William & Mary]], and highly touted guard Terry Henderson suffered an ankle injury in the first 10 minutes, which resulted in him sitting out for the rest of the season. This was the beginning of a long and painful season for the Pack. NC State struggled to compete in the ACC after going 10\u20133 out of conference. Junior point guard, [[Anthony Barber (basketball)|Anthony \"Cat\" Barber]] finished the season as the ACC's leading scorer, averaging 23.5 points per game and making the All-ACC first team. After a tough loss to [[2015-16 Duke Blue Devils men's basketball team|Duke]] in the second round of the ACC Tournament, NC State finished the season 16\u201317 and 5\u201313 in the ACC, making it Gottfried's worst season to date. The Wolfpack decided to not participate in any post-season tournaments.\n\nExpectations ran high for Gottfried's sixth season as head coach, with a highly touted recruiting class and several key players returning such as [[Abdul-Malik Abu]] and [[BeeJay Anya]]. It was later announced that he would be fired at the end of the season.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.wralsportsfan.com/nc-state-s-gottfried-will-not-return-next-season/16533628/ | title=NC State's

The Wolfpack also appeared in the Final Four of the 1947 [[National Invitational Tournament]], which was during the NIT's \"national championship era.\"\n\nNC State achieved its 1700th overall win against Presbyterian College, 86-68, becoming the 26th NCAA school to reach such an achievement.<ref name=\"sports-reference.com\"/>\n\n===The early years (1910\u20131945)===\nIn 1910 Guy Bryan formed a special committee that proposed to the university administration the organization of the school's first basketball team.<ref name=\"media-guide-101\">Media Guide, p. 101</ref> The program played its first official intercollegiate basketball game on February 16, 1911 against a much more experienced squad from [[Wake Forest Demon Deacons men's basketball|Wake Forest]]. NC State, then known as the North Carolina A&M Farmers, lost, 33\u20136. The two teams met again five days later in Raleigh, with A&M earning its first-ever victory, 19\u201318. The following year, the school's athletics council officially recognized basketball as a sport.<ref name=\"media-guide-101\"/>\n\nBefore the 1920\u201321 season the university changed its name from North Carolina A&M to North Carolina State College. At that time the school's nickname was the \"Tech.\"<ref name=\"media-guide-101\"/> That season the program joined the fledgling [[Southern Conference]] as a charter member.<ref name=\"packpride\">{{cite web|last=Crawford|first=Jacob|title=Complete History of NC State Basketball|url=http://northcarolinastate.scout.com/2/209048.html|publisher=Pack Pride|date=2003-12-26|accessdate=2008-06-30|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090517115139/http://northcarolinastate.scout.com/2/209048.html|archivedate=2009-05-17}}</ref> State College changed its nickname yet again in 1923, this time to the \"Red Terrors.\" The name was drawn from a combination of the play of Rochelle \"Red\" Johnson and the team's new bright red road uniforms. Also in 1923, State opened its first basketball facility, Frank Thompson Gym. The gym, named in honor of a former athlete from the school who died in action during [[World War I]], served as the team's home until 1948.<ref name=\"media-guide-101\"/> During the first years of the program, the team had no practice facility and was forced to practice on an outdoor field in nearby [[Pullen Park]].<ref>Chapelow ''Raleigh's Reynolds Coliseum'', p.34</ref>\n\nGus Tebell took over the basketball team as head coach in 1924. During his tenure he led the program to a number of school firsts, including the first conference championship in 1929 and the first 20-win season. He compiled a then all-time program best career coaching record at 79\u201336. The Wolfpack's first player to garner significant national recognition was Bud Rose, who, after the 1931\u201332 season, was named as an honorable mention All-American.<ref name=\"media-guide-101\"/>\n\nIn 1941 the university began construction on [[Reynolds Coliseum|William Neal Reynolds Coliseum]], a multi-purpose arena that would serve as the new home of Wolfpack basketball. Construction was stalled due to the involvement of the United States in [[World War II]], and the skeleton structure of the arena was left unfinished for nearly six years until its completion in 1949. The Wolfpack would play its home games at Reynolds for the next 50 years, until the men's team moved to [[PNC Arena]] in 1999.\n\n===Everett Case era (1946\u20131965)===\nFollowing the end of World War II, chancellor [[John W. Harrelson]] and athletic director H.A. Fisher set upon rebuilding the university's athletic teams. In 1946 David Clark, a former president of the NC State Alumni Association, suggested to the Athletics Council that the best place to search for a new head basketball coach would be in Indiana, which was a basketball hotbed at the time. Per Clark's suggestion, Harrelson and his father Stejem Mark met with Indiana native [[Chuck Taylor (salesman)|Chuck Taylor]] who was in Raleigh to coach his army team in an exhibition game against NC State. Taylor's recommendation for the job was his former high school coach [[Everett Case]].<ref name=\"Chapelow-34\">Chappelow ''Raleigh's Reynolds Coliseum, p.34</ref> When approached by Harrelson about the job, Case was at first hesitant because of the tight restrictions under which the program had been operating. Harrelson assured Case that he would be given an expanded budget and more than enough scholarships to field a competitive team. Additionally, Case was lured by the still unfinished Reynolds Coliseum. He accepted the job almost immediately without ever visiting the campus.<ref name=\"Menzer-30\">Menzer ''Four Corners'', p.30</ref>\n\n====Six consecutive Southern Conference titles====\n\nEverett Case was named head coach on July 1, 1946. Case had previously coached high school basketball in Indiana, where in 23 seasons he compiled a 726\u201375 record and won four state championships at Frankfort, High School.<ref name=\"ID-HOF\">{{cite web|title=Indiana Basketball Hall of Fame: Everett Case|url=http://www.hoopshall.com/inductees/1968/case.html|accessdate=2008-07-08}}</ref> Before arriving at NC State, he spent two years as an assistant coach at the [[University of Southern California]] and spent several years coaching teams at various Naval bases during the war.<ref name=\"Menzer-29\">Menzer ''Four Corners'', p.29</ref> In February 1947, his first season at NC State, Case defeated [[North Carolina Tar Heels men's basketball|North Carolina]] in Chapel Hill, 48\u201346 in overtime, beginning a streak of 15 consecutive victories over the Tar Heels. Later that month, an afternoon game in Thompson Gym against [[Duke Blue Devils men's basketball|Duke]] was postponed by city fire officials because of overcrowding. That evening the game was officially canceled after fans were found sneaking through bathroom windows, breaking down doors, and hiding in the basement.<ref name=\"media-guide-102\">Media Guide, p. 102</ref> Less than three weeks later, Case guided the Red Terrors to their first Southern Conference championship in 18 years. Case and his team celebrated by performing an Indiana high school tradition of cutting down the nets. The tradition soon spread to college teams across the nation and survives amongst championship teams to this day.<ref name=\"nets\">{{cite web|title=Cutting down the nets part of winning fabric|url=https://www.usatoday.com/sports/college/mensbasketball/tourney05/2005-03-23-trimming-nets_x.htm|last=Gluskin|first=Michael|publisher=USA Today|date=2005-03-23|accessdate=2008-06-30}}</ref> Soon after his arrival, Case was named \"Tar Heel of the Week\" by the Raleigh ''[[News and Observer]]'', citing that \"since the little man came here from Indiana...basketball has almost supplanted politics as the favorite topic of discussion in the North Carolina capital.\"<ref name=\"Grundy-196\">Grundy ''Learning to Win'', p.196</ref> In Case's second season as head coach the team changed its nickname from the Red Terrors to the Wolfpack.<ref name=\"media-guide-102\"/>\n\nIn February 1948, Case made alterations to the design of the still incomplete Reynolds Coliseum. Attempting to usurp [[Duke University|Duke]]'s [[Cameron Indoor Stadium]] as the largest basketball arena in the area,<ref name=\"packpride\"/> Case insisted that the blueprints be changed to increase the maximum capacity from 9,000 seats to 12,400. Construction resumed later that month after a final shipment of steel arrived in Raleigh.<ref name=\"media-guide-102\"/> Reynolds officially opened its doors on December 2, 1949, with a Wolfpack win over Washington & Lee, 67\u201347, in front of a crowd of 11,020.<ref name=\"Chappelow-59\">Chappelow ''Raleigh's Reynolds Coliseum'', p.59</ref> At that time, the arena was the largest college basketball facility in the southeast.<ref name=\"media-guide-102\"/> Soon after Reynolds' opening, the ''[[Greensboro News & Record]]'' wrote that Raleigh had become \"the basketball capital of the world.

The Dixie Classic was a three-day tournament held each December until 1961 that matched the four [[Tobacco Road (rivalry)|Tobacco Road]] schools of NC State, North Carolina, Duke, and Wake Forest against four of the top teams from across the country. In its time the Dixie Classic became the largest regular season tournament in college basketball.<ref>{{cite web|last=Carr |first=A.J. |title=Dixie Classic scandal left bad taste |url=http://www.newsobserver.com/122/story/418466.html |publisher=News & Observer |date=2006-03-16 |accessdate=2008-06-30 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070312223301/http://www.newsobserver.com/122/story/418466.html |archivedate=March 12, 2007 }}</ref> After finishing the season at 27\u20136 and winning its fourth consecutive Southern Conference Tournament, the Wolfpack received invitations to both the [[National Invitation Tournament]] and the [[NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament]]. Case declined the NIT bid and accepted the invitation to the program's first ever NCAA Tournament.<ref name=\"Chappelow-60\">Chappelow ''Raleigh's Reynolds Coliseum'', p.60</ref> The team defeated [[College of the Holy Cross|Holy Cross]] before losing to eventual champion [[City College of New York]], 78\u201373. NC State went on to defeat [[Baylor Bears men's basketball|Baylor]] in the third-place game, 53\u201341.<ref name=\"media-guide-102\"/> The Wolfpack won its fifth consecutive Southern Conference title in 1951 and its sixth the following year. Both seasons ended in early exits from the NCAA Tournament, though. In 1951 State defeated [[Villanova Wildcats men's basketball|Villanova]] in the first round before losing to [[Illinois Fighting Illini men's basketball|Illinois]]. In 1952 the team lost in the first round to [[St. John's Red Storm men's basketball|St. John's]] and future North Carolina head coach [[Frank McGuire]].\n\nThe Wolfpack's six-year winning streak against North Carolina came to an end in January 1953, as the Wolfpack, ranked #17 in the country, lost to the unranked Tar Heels in Raleigh, 70\u201369.<ref>{{cite web|title=AP Ranking for Wednesday, January 2, 1952|url=http://www.sportsstats.com/AP/Ranking/19520102.html|publisher=SportStats.com|accessdate=2008-07-06}}</ref> It was the first match between the two schools since the hiring of Frank \"the man\" McGuire the previous summer. McGuire inflamed NC State players and fans by having his players cut down the nets in Reynolds Coliseum following the victory.<ref name=\"media-guide-102\"/> Despite the loss, the Pack finished first in the conference at 13\u20133 but lost in the conference tournament championship game. The team was ranked 18th in the final AP poll of 1953 but was left out of the NCAA Tournament for the first time in four years.\n\n====The move to the ACC====\n\nBy the end of the 1952\u201353 season the Southern Conference had bloated to 17 members and was still seen as a football-centric conference. Maryland and Duke had become national football powers and there weren't many schools in the conference that could regularly compete against them. In an effort to create a more balanced round-robin schedule and thus secure an automatic bid to the [[Orange Bowl (game)|Orange Bowl]], the top eight football schools from the conference\u2014Maryland, Duke, UNC, Virginia, South Carolina, Clemson, Wake Forest, and NC State\u2014left to form the [[Atlantic Coast Conference]].<ref name=\"Menzer-43-44\">Menzer ''Four Corners'', p.43\u201344</ref>\n\nNC State's first ACC contest was on the road against Wake Forest in December 1953. The Wolfpack was ranked #8 in the nation at the time, but just as in the first ever meeting between the two schools, Wake Forest prevailed. Case and his squad defeated the Demon Deacons later that season in the first-ever ACC Tournament championship game, 82\u201380 in overtime. The victory meant a return trip to the [[1954 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|NCAA Tournament]], where NC State defeated George Washington in the first round before losing to eventual champion La Salle in the second round. Case's squad won a second ACC title the following year, defeating Duke in 87\u201377 in the championship game. The team finished with a 28\u20134 record but was ineligible for postseason play; earlier in the season the NCAA imposed four years' probation and banned them from postseason play during that time for numerous recruiting violations.<ref>[https://web1.ncaa.org/LSDBi/exec/miSearch?miSearchSubmit=publicReport&key=29&publicTerms=THIS%20PHRASE%20WILL%20NOT%20BE%20REPEATED 1956 infraction report]</ref> The Wolfpack brought home a third consecutive ACC title in the 1955\u201356 season, setting a record for consecutive ACC championships that stood until 2002. The team also played in its first televised game earlier that season, losing to North Carolina in Chapel Hill, 73\u201369.<ref name=\"media-guide-102\"/> State struggled in the 1956\u201357 season, finishing fifth in the conference for the first time under Case.  State's loss in the first round of that year's [[1957 ACC Men's Basketball Tournament|ACC Tournament]] also marked the first time that Case did not lead his team to the conference championship game. To add insult to injury, bitter rival North Carolina brought the ACC its first national championship.  The team finished third in 1958 and was ranked 20th in the nation at the season's end but again lost early in the [[1958 ACC Men's Basketball Tournament|ACC Tournament]], this time to North Carolina in the quarterfinals.\n\nThe 1958 Dixie Classic brought to Reynolds Coliseum some of the most talented teams ever assembled for the tournament. Included in the field were eight players who eventually earned All-American honors, including NC State's [[Lou Pucillo]] and [[John Richter]], North Carolina's Lee Shaffer, York Larese, and Doug Moe, [[Cincinnati Bearcats men's basketball|Cincinnati]]'s [[Oscar Robertson]], [[Michigan State Spartans men's basketball|Michigan State]]'s [[Johnny Green (basketball)|Johnny Green]], and [[Louisville Cardinals men's basketball|Louisville]]'s [[Don Goldstein]]. Later that season, NC State, ranked #10 in the nation, defeated North Carolina, ranked #5, 80\u201356 to win their fourth ACC championship in six seasons.  However, due to the 1956 sanctions, they were ineligible for the NCAA Tournament. The Pack finished the season ranked #6 with a 22\u20134 record.<ref name=\"media-guide-102\"/>\n\n====Case's final years====\nThe 1959\u201360 Wolfpack team finished with an 11\u201315 record, marking Case's first losing season in Raleigh. The team finished fourth in the ACC in 1961 and third in 1962 but lost in the first round of the conference tournament both seasons. In the summer of 1962, Case, then 62 years old, hired his former player and then Clemson head coach [[Press Maravich]] to be his top assistant. Case's health began to deteriorate rapidly over the following two seasons as the Wolfpack finished fifth in the ACC in 1963 and seventh in 1964. The seventh-place finish was the lowest of Case's tenure and would prove to be his last. On December 7, 1964, just two games into the season, Everett Case retired and named Maravich as his successor.<ref name=\"media-guide-102\"/> During his tenure, Case won six Southern Conference titles, four ACC titles, and qualified for the NCAA Tournament twice. His overall record of 377\u2013134 remains the best in NC State history.{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}}\n\nMaravich led the Pack to second-place finish in the conference and an ACC championship, its first in six years.

On April 30, 1966, the day after Maravich announced that he was leaving, Everett Case died while in a Raleigh hospital.\n\n===Norm Sloan era (1967\u20131980)===\nJust a week after Maravich's exit, former Wolfpack basketball and football player [[Norm Sloan]] was hired as the new head coach. In 1967\u201368, his first season, Sloan's team finished the regular season third in the ACC with a 9\u20135 conference record.<ref name=\"media-guide-103\">Media Guide, p. 103</ref> State made it as far as the ACC championship game before losing to North Carolina 87\u201350, but it was the Pack's semifinal game against tenth-ranked Duke that is most remembered. Sloan realized that his team was vastly undersized against the Blue Devils. He decided, however, to use the Wolfpack's quickness to its advantage and keep the ball away from the Duke players for as much of the game as possible. Using a tactic he coined \"stall-ball,\" Sloan instructed his players to hold the ball at halfcourt and slow the game down as much as possible. The final result was the lowest scoring game in ACC Tournament history. Duke led 4\u20132 at halftime and the Wolfpack held the ball for more than 13 straight minutes in the second half. In the end, State prevailed 12\u201310.<ref name=\"stall-ball\">{{cite web|last=Fowler|first=Scott|title=Integrating the ACC, one player at a time|url=http://www.charlotte.com/759/story/533647.html|publisher=Charlotte.com|date=2008-03-12|accessdate=2008-06-30}}</ref>\n\nThe following season marked another historic first in the Wolfpack program, as on December 2, 1968, Al Heartly debuted as the school's first African-American basketball player.

The team finished the regular season at 23\u20137 overall and third in the conference. In the conference championship game, the Pack defeated third-ranked [[South Carolina Gamecocks men's basketball|South Carolina]] 42\u201339 in double overtime.<ref name=\"media-guide-103\"/> With the victory, the Wolfpack was invited to its first NCAA Tournament in five years. State received a bye in the first round of the tournament and lost its first game to St. Bonaventure in the semifinals, 80\u201368. In the Eastern Regional third-place game, the Pack defeated Niagara, 108\u201388. Despite State's quick exit from the tournament, Sloan's squad finished the season ranked tenth in the AP poll, its first end-of-the-season ranking since being ranked sixth following the 1958\u201359 season.\n\nDuring the spring of 1970, just after the season's end, Sloan signed [[Tom Burleson]]. Burleson, a 7'4\" native of [[Newland, NC]], was the first major player of the Wolfpack squad that would have a combined record of 57\u20131 during the 1972\u201373 and 1973\u201374 seasons to be signed. The following spring, Sloan signed the remaining pieces of the 1974 championship nucleus, 6'4\" [[David Thompson (basketball)|David Thompson]], 5'7\" point guard [[Monte Towe]], and 6'7\" power forward [[Tim Stoddard]].<ref name=\"media-guide-103\"/> At the time, the NCAA prohibited freshmen from competing on varsity squads and the team struggled in the following two seasons, finishing seventh in the ACC in 1970\u201371 and fifth in 1971\u201372. At 13\u201314 overall, the 1970\u201371 season was Sloan's worst and his only losing season as the Wolfpack head coach.\n\nWith the addition of Thompson, Towe, and Stoddard to the starting lineup in 1972\u201373, the team rebounded quickly from its recent struggles.

The third game of the season was against seven-time defending national champions [[UCLA Bruins men's basketball|UCLA]] and coach [[John Wooden]]. The Pack came out sluggish and was easily defeated, 84\u201366.

In the semifinals State easily defeated Virginia, 87\u201366. In the championship game the team faced off against fourth-ranked Maryland, which had lost by only six points in each of the teams' regular season meetings. Maryland jumped to an early 25\u201312 lead, hitting 12 of its first 14 shots. The Wolfpack cut the deficit to five points at halftime, but momentum shifted throughout the second half. NC State led by four late in the game, but Maryland closed the gap and sent the game to overtime, tied at 97.

They defeated their first two opponents, Providence and Pittsburgh, by a combined 32 points to set up a Final Four rematch with UCLA. In the week leading up to the game, thousands of fans packed Reynolds Coliseum to watch the Wolfpack practice. When the two teams finally met in [[Greensboro, NC|Greensboro]], it was another tight contest for the Pack. After ending regulation tied at 65, each team scored only two points in the first overtime. UCLA took a seven-point lead in the second extra period, but NC State led by David Thompson, took the lead for the final time with 34 seconds to play.

His last team (1979\u201380) team reached the NCAA Tournament, losing to Iowa in the second round. Also, twice during his final six seasons in Raleigh his teams played in the [[National Invitation Tournament|NIT]]. In 1976, the Pack advanced to the [[1976 National Invitation Tournament|semifinals]] and in 1978, it defeated [[South Carolina Gamecocks men's basketball|South Carolina]], Detroit, and [[Georgetown Hoyas men's basketball|Georgetown]] before falling to [[Texas Longhorns men's basketball|Texas]] in the [[1978 National Invitation Tournament|championship game]].

Whittenburg returned to the court in time for the [[1983 ACC Men's Basketball Tournament|ACC Tournament]], which most believed the Pack needed to win in order to secure a second consecutive berth in the NCAA Tournament. State did just that, defeating heavily favored North Carolina and [[Virginia Cavaliers men's basketball|Virginia]] squads led by [[Michael Jordan]] and [[Ralph Sampson]], respectively. The Wolfpack kept winning. Their close games and exciting finishes in the ACC Tournament and early rounds of the NCAA tournament earned them the moniker The Cardiac Pack.  As a #6 seed in the [[1983 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|NCAA Tournament]], the Wolfpack won narrow victories over Pepperdine (in double overtime) and UNLV (71\u201370) before defeating [[Utah Utes men's basketball|Utah]] in the Sweet Sixteen, 75\u201356. In the regional final, NC State again defeated Virginia, 63\u201362, then defeated [[Georgia Bulldogs men's basketball|Georgia]] in the Final Four to advance to the championship game against [[Houston Cougars men's basketball|Houston]]. The Cougars, nicknamed [[Phi Slama Jama]] for their athletic, fast-paced style of play that featured [[Clyde Drexler]] and [[Hakeem Olajuwon]], were expected to win easily over the underdog Wolfpack. NC State escaped with their second national title after a last-second air ball by Dereck Whittenburg was caught and dunked by [[Lorenzo Charles]].<ref name=\"packpride\"/> The 54\u201352 final is one of the most famous in college basketball history.[https://www.usatoday.com/sports/college/basketball/men/02tourney/greatest-games.htm]\n\nValvano's 1984 team finished 7th in the ACC and lost in the first round of the [[1984 National Invitation Tournament|NIT]] to future conference foe [[Florida State Seminoles men's basketball|Florida State]]. The following season, with the addition of guard [[Vinny Del Negro]], the Pack began a run of five consecutive trips to the NCAA Tournament. The Pack reached the Elite Eight in [[1985 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|1985]] and [[1986 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|1986]] and the Sweet Sixteen in [[1989 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|1989]]. In 1987, after a sixth-place finish in the regular season, NC State made another surprising run through the [[1987 ACC Men's Basketball Tournament|ACC Tournament]]. In the championship game, State defeated rival North Carolina, which had gone undefeated in conference play. It was the program's last ACC championship to date. State finished second in the conference the following year and was a #3 seed in the [[1988 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|NCAA Tournament]]. The team made an early exit, though, losing to #14 seed [[Murray State Racers men's basketball|Murray State]] in the first round.<ref name=\"packpride\"/>\n\nValvano's final season in Raleigh was mired in controversy after the release of the book, ''Personal Fouls'', written by Peter Golenbock. In the book, Golenbock alleged improper practices and a lack of institutional control in the NC State athletics department. The allegations included grade fixing, lowered or waived entrance requirements for athletes, the selling of tickets and sneakers by athletes, and frequent drug use by athletes.<ref name=\"personal-fouls\">{{cite web|last=Carroll|first=Kent|title='Personal Fouls' Is Defended|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C0CE2DF1F3DF93BA15752C0A966958260|publisher=New York Times|date=1990-01-28|accessdate=2008-06-30}}</ref> The claims were refuted by Valvano and Chancellor [[Bruce Poulton]], claiming that some of the players might have sold some of their shoes, most notably to ACC superfan Jason Bass. The NCAA investigation, and 5 additional investigations by separate entities found only that players indeed sold shoes and their complimentary game tickets for spending money. Nonetheless, the NCAA banned NC State from postseason play for the 1989-90 season. Earlier, NC State limited itself to only 12 total scholarships for 1990-91 and 1991-92. Although Valvano was not named in the NCAA report at all, new chancellor [[Larry Monteith]] forced his resignation on April 7, 1990.<ref name=\"packpride\"/><ref>[https://web3.ncaa.org/lsdbi/search/miCaseView/report?id=101719 1989 infractions report]</ref>\n\n===Les Robinson era (1990\u20131996)===\nTo replace Valvano, NC State turned to [[East Tennessee State Buccaneers men's basketball|East Tennessee State]] coach [[Les Robinson]], who had played for Case in the 1960s. Robinson was the 1991 District Coach of the Year as selected by the National Association of Basketball Coaches (NABC) after leading NC State to a 20\u201311 record in the first season.  He was the first first-year coach in ACC history to win 20 games, post a winning regular season conference record, and win games in both the ACC and NCAA Tournaments.  The only other coach to pull off this feat is North Carolina's [[Bill Guthridge]].\n\nHowever, the lost scholarships took their full effect a year later, and the Wolfpack plummeted into the ACC's second division for the next five years. The low point of Robinson's tenure at his alma mater came during the 1992\u201393 season. Due to injuries and academic-related suspensions, Robinson was only able to dress seven players for most conference games.  They ultimately finished 8\u201319, the worst record in modern Wolfpack history.\n\nIn 1992 the ACC Tournament was expanded because of the addition of Florida State. A play-in game between the eighth and ninth place teams was created, and during his five years as the N.C. State coach after its addition, Robinson's Wolfpack played in the play-in game four out of five times (finishing seventh in 1992). Because of his team's traditional appearance in the Thursday night play-in game, the game became known as the \"Les Robinson Invitational\" by ACC fans. The play-in game was discontinued when the ACC expanded to include Miami and Virginia Tech, and required three Thursday games. With the later addition of Boston College, there are now four games on Thursday.\n\nLes Robinson would stay on as head coach through the 1995\u201396 season.  While he never tallied another winning record, his stint went a long way towards cleansing the image of the program to both insiders and outsiders.<ref name=\"packpride\"/> Robinson was appointed NC State's athletic director in 1996 and stepped down as head coach. He left to become The Citadel's athletic director in 2000.\n\n===Herb Sendek era (1996\u20132006)===\n[[File:RBC Center.jpg|right|thumb|[[PNC Arena]], which opened in 1999, is the current home of Wolfpack basketball.]]\n[[Herb Sendek|Sendek]] was hired at NC State in 1996 after three years of success at Miami (Ohio), his first head coaching experience. He immediately improved upon the Les Robinson era, winning 17 games for the program's first winning record in six years. In his first year at NC State, the Wolfpack also finished the year winning eight of 11 games, advanced to the finals of the ACC Tournament, and earned a trip to the postseason in the NIT.\n\nSendek coached NC State to the NCAA tournament five consecutive years from 2002 until 2006 (tying the school record). He had his most success during these last five years, winning his 100th game at NC State in 2002 and having a winning conference record in each year but one. In 2004, Sendek won ACC Coach of the Year and Julius Hodge, one of Sendek's most prized recruits during his NC State tenure, won the ACC Men's Basketball Player of the Year. In 2005, NC State upset defending champion Connecticut in the second round of the NCAA tournament to advance to the Sweet Sixteen, NC State's deepest run into the tournament during Sendek's years. Sendek finished his NC State coaching career with a 71\u201388 record in the ACC and a 32\u201387 record against RPI top 50 teams.  On April 3, 2006, Sendek accepted the head coaching job at Arizona State.\n\n===Sidney Lowe era (2006\u20132011)===\n[[Sidney Lowe]] was named head coach in May 2006 after a month-long search that included such targets as [[Rick Barnes]], [[John Beilein]], [[John Calipari]], and [[Steve Lavin]].<ref name=\"lowe-hire\">{{cite web|last=Katz|first=Andy|title=Sources: Pistons' Lowe agrees to coach North Carolina State|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/ncb/news/story?id=2433439|publisher=ESPN.com|date=2006-05-05|accessdate=2008-06-30}}</ref> Lowe's first season got off to a good start as the Wolfpack won its first five games.

He returned to Raleigh in 2006 to replace Herb Sendek as coach, but the Wolfpack struggled to sustain any momentum in Lowe's five seasons. Although he made the NIT twice, he never made the NCAA tournament as a coach, and never finished higher than ninth place in the ACC. He went 86\u201378, including just 25\u201355 in ACC play. Lowe was 3\u201316 record against rivals Duke and North Carolina, with two of those wins coming in his first year.\n\nLowe also spent five years as an NBA head coach in Minnesota and Memphis, compiling a 79\u2013228 record.\n\n===Mark Gottfried era (2011\u20132017)===\n[[Mark Gottfried]] was named head coach on April 5, 2011. In his first season as head coach of NC State, [[Mark Gottfried]] recorded a 22\u201312 overall regular season record, including a 9\u20137 regular season record in the ACC, and reached the semifinals of the ACC tournament. [[Mark Gottfried]] recorded the second best season by a first-year coach at State, second only to [[Everett Case]]. Gottfried's first Wolfpack team earned a #11 seed in the 2012 NCAA Tournament. The Pack won in the tournament over sixth seeded [[San Diego State Aztecs men's basketball|San Diego State]] and third seeded [[Georgetown Hoyas men's basketball|Georgetown]] to advance to the Sweet Sixteen, where it lost to second seeded Kansas. They finished the season ranked #20 in the AP Poll.\n\nEntering the 2012\u201313 season, expectations ran high for Gottfried's second season as head coach. The Wolfpack returned four starters from its 2012 Sweet Sixteen squad and were joined by a trio of talented freshman, each of whom were selected as [[McDonald's All-American Game|McDonald's All Americans]]. As a result, NC State started the season ranked #6 in the AP preseason poll, the Wolfpack's second-highest preseason ranking in program history. Additionally, NC State was voted as preseason favorite to win the ACC title in the conference's annual media survey and the inaugural league coaches\u2019 poll. Ultimately, [[2012\u201313 NC State Wolfpack men's basketball team|the team]] did not live up to media expectations. 24\u201311 overall, The Wolfpack finished tied for fourth in the ACC regular season standings with a 24\u201311 overall record (11\u20137 ACC) and as a #8 seed lost its first game in the second round of the 2013 NCAA tournament to [[2012-13 Temple Owls men's basketball team|Temple]].\n\nMark Gottfried began his third season as head coach of the Wolfpack having lost five of seven players who logged significant minutes (four of which were starters). They struggled for most of the season, finishing 9\u20139 in ACC play. However, the Wolfpack surprised many by making the semifinals of the ACC tournament by upsetting #11 [[2013-14 Syracuse Orange men's basketball team|Syracuse]], who entered the tournament as a second seed. They eventually lost to a third seeded Duke team. They were selected as a #12 seed in the 2014 NCAA tournament, where they won over [[2013-14 Xavier Musketeers men's basketball team|Xavier]] in the First Four before losing in the second round to St. Louis. They finished the season 22\u201314.\n\nComing into Gottfried's fourth season, NC State had lost [[T.J. Warren]], the ACC's leading scorer the previous year, to the NBA draft. They also lost point guard Tyler Lewis, who transferred to [[Butler University|Butler]]. They finished 19\u201312 with a 10\u20138 ACC record. NC State upset [[Jahlil Okafor]] and #2 [[2014-15 Duke Blue Devils men's basketball team|Duke]] on January 11, nearly two years after upsetting them in the same place in 2013. They also upset #15 [[2014-15 North Carolina Tar Heels men's basketball team|UNC]] in the Dean Smith Center for the first time since 2003, holding the Heels to their lowest home point total ever. These two wins, along with wins against [[2014-15 Louisville Cardinals men's basketball team|Louisville]] and [[2014-15 Syracuse Orange men's basketball team|Syracuse]] made Gottfried the first coach to beat all ACC Hall of Fame coaches in the same year. They made it to the quarterfinals of the ACC tournament where they lost to Duke, and were selected as an 8 seed in the NCAA tournament where they made the Sweet Sixteen, upsetting #1 [[2014-15 Villanova Wildcats men's basketball team|Villanova]] along the way.\n\nIn Gottfried's fifth season, NC State lost half of its scoring threat with [[Trevor Lacey]] declaring for the draft and Ralston Turner and Desmond Lee graduating. Additionally, Kyle Washington transferred to the [[University of Cincinnati|Cincinnati]]. NC State suffered a loss in their opening game against [[2015-16 William & Mary Tribe men's basketball team|William & Mary]], and highly touted guard Terry Henderson suffered an ankle injury in the first 10 minutes, which resulted in him sitting out for the rest of the season. This was the beginning of a long and painful season for the Pack. NC State struggled to compete in the ACC after going 10\u20133 out of conference. Junior point guard, [[Anthony Barber (basketball)|Anthony \"Cat\" Barber]] finished the season as the ACC's leading scorer, averaging 23.5 points per game and making the All-ACC first team. After a tough loss to [[2015-16 Duke Blue Devils men's basketball team|Duke]] in the second round of the ACC Tournament, NC State finished the season 16\u201317 and 5\u201313 in the ACC, making it Gottfried's worst season to date. The Wolfpack decided to not participate in any post-season tournaments.\n\nExpectations ran high for Gottfried's sixth season as head coach, with a highly touted recruiting class and several key players returning such as [[Abdul-Malik Abu]] and [[BeeJay Anya]]. It was later announced that he would be fired at the end of the season.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.wralsportsfan.com/nc-state-s-gottfried-will-not-return-next-season/16533628/ | title=NC State's
