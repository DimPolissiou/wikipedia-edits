The player controls the colonial forces of either England, France, The Netherlands, or Spain; the other powers are then played by the computer. Each nation has unique abilities that favor certain strategies. There is a choice between a historical map (America) or a randomly generated map (the New World), and players may also construct their own map with the included scenario editor.\n\nThe journey begins with a ship and two units arriving at the new world; as the ship moves into the unknown, the map is revealed. Subsequently, the player makes landfall, explores the New World, meets the indigenous [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Indians]], builds colonies and buildings, and improves and works the surrounding land. The ship can return to [[Europe]] to collect more colonists and sell items.\n\nThe colonists can work the immediate land around the colony. Different map squares can yield different resources; for instance, most squares can produce food, while only forests can yield lumber. Harvested resources from the land, such as cotton or tobacco, can be manufactured and converted into commodities, such as cloth and cigars, and either used or sold. The prices of commodities in Europe fluctuate depending upon supply and demand. With money, the player is able to buy goods, fund faster building construction, recruit new colonists, or buy ships and artillery. The king may at different times raise colonial taxes to pay for a war taking place in Europe.\n\nThe player is also required to protect their colonies from potential invasion by equipping and stationing soldiers. Moreover, the player manages their citizens, educating them in various skills to increase their productivity in areas such as farming, gathering of resources, or manufacturing.\n\nPlayers may send missionaries into Indian villages to convert them to Christianity. The Indians may accept and convert, or they may refuse and burn the missionary at the stake. If another colonial power has already established a mission in a village, a missionary may attempt to denounce them as heretics with an equal 50/50 chance of success or failure.\n\nWhen waging war, the player has a basic colonial army consisting of militiamen, artillery, cavalry, and ships. Weapons and soldiers can be purchased from Europe, however to win independence, the player will need to develop an indigenous armaments industry. Indians will initially only have braves and no horses or guns; over time they may obtain them via trade or defeating colonial forces in battle. Guns and horses must be available in a colony to equip citizens and turn them into soldiers. If a colonial power captures a colony, it will remain in their possession unless it is retaken by force. Indians will destroy a colony if they capture it.\n\nColonies are preferably put on the coast, although they can be built inland, the player must build wagons to transport goods between colonies. In addition, wagons are necessary to trade with inland Indian villages. Goods may be sold to rival colonial powers, sent back to Europe for sale, or sold to Indian villages.\n\nColonists come in four types. The first is the basic free citizen, who has no particular skills but may be assigned to any job. If a citizen performs the same job for a certain length of time, the game will upgrade him to a specialist in that particular job. The second is the indentured servant. He is suitable for performing unskilled labor, but less productive at skilled trades. With enough time at a particular job, he may become a free citizen. The third is the petty criminal. Like the indentured servant, petty criminals are only useful for unskilled labor. Petty criminals can eventually become free citizens through military service. If they survive enough battles eventually they are promoted to indentured servant followed eventually by free citizen. All free citizens can become veterans by winning enough battles.\n\nCitizens may also travel to an Indian village and learn a skill from the natives such as tobacco farming. The Indians will not permit petty criminals to live among them, but will teach free citizens and indentured servants. In addition, missionaries may convert Indians to Christianity and convince them to live in the player's towns, where they will be functionally similar to an indentured servant (i.e. good at unskilled labor, poor at skilled trades).\n\nSpecialists are citizens who are trained and skilled at a specific profession. These can either be free citizens or indentured servants who learned the profession through time, by visiting an Indian village, or they can be pre-existing specialists (obtained via European immigration). Some professions, for example growing cotton, sugar and tobacco, can only be learned in the colony, and are unknown in Europe. Eventually the player can build schoolhouses where they can teach their citizens to become specialists in specific professions. The player may at any time unassign a specialist and turn him back into an ordinary free citizen.\n\nHorses can be imported from Europe. If any colony has two or more horses, they will breed up to a maximum number. An unskilled colonist (including a petty criminal) who enters a neutral or friendly Indian village on horseback may (rarely) be killed, may be given a gift, or may be promoted to be a specialist scout. Scouts have a better chance to meet with a favorable reaction when entering a village, and an improved chance of discovering a fabled 'Fountain of Youth' when investigating ancient ruins; which will provoke a sudden influx of potential colonists of all types to the player's European port. Further, mounted soldiers are more effective and have a better survival rate than dismounted infantry.\n\nEach colonial power has certain bonuses that make them unique and different from each other. Aside from European colonial powers, the NPC powers include eight Native American tribes, in four main categories. Each [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] settlement can convert one regular colonist into a specialist. More advanced tribes (Incas and Aztecs) live in larger cities. Analogous to 'Wonders of the World' in the [[Civilization (series)|''Civilization'' series]] of games, social and industrial advances are achieved by the addition of \"Founding Fathers\" to the \"Continental Congress\", which are gained by generating a sufficient number of \"[[Liberty Bell]]s\" through the colonial pride of settlers. These are all named after real historical figures, such as [[Francisco V\u00e1squez de Coronado]] and [[Pocahontas]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2015}}\n\nOne main driving impulse in ''Colonization'' is the harvesting of natural resources, such as lumber (for building), ore (for manufacturing), and food (for population growth). Squares on the map have basic values of resource output (depending on the type of terrain and if a river runs through it), but certain \"prime\" squares have double or higher output values.\n\nThe ultimate goal of the game is declaring independence from the mother country. When the player is producing sufficient Liberty Bells, he may choose to declare independence. He then has to defeat most of the King's army to win, which is not an easy task as the royal army and navy are usually more powerful than the player's colonial forces. Other colonial powers may help with the enterprise, analogous to the [[France in the American Revolutionary War|French intervention in the American Revolutionary War]].\n\n==Development==\n''[[Computer Gaming World]]''{{'}}s \"The Rumor Bag\" column reported in April 1994 that \"MicroProse is working on a game like ''Sid Meier's Civilization'' that covers the Age of Colonization\".<ref name=\"cgw199404\">{{Cite magazine\n |last=Swyfte\n |first=George Bernard\n |author=\n |last2=\n |first2=\n |date=April 1994\n |title=Pot Of Hops\n |department=The Rumor Bag\n |url=http://www.cgwmuseum.org/galleries/index.php?year=1994&pub=2&id=117 \n |magazine=Computer Gaming World\n |page=186}}</ref>\n\n[[GOG.com]] released an [[Emulator|emulated]] version for [[Microsoft Windows]], [[Linux]] and [[Mac OS X]] in 2012.<ref>{{cite web |title=Release: Sid Meier's Colonization |url=https://www.gog.com/news/release_sid_meiers_colonization |website=[[GOG.com]] |publisher=[[CD Projekt]] |accessdate=February 26, 2019 |date=May 30, 2012}}</ref>\n\n== Reception ==\n{{Video game reviews \n| PCGUS = 85%<ref name=pcgamerus>{{cite journal | author=Meredith, Gary | journal=[[PC Gamer US]] | url=http://www.pcgamer.com:80/reviews/943.html | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20000226113638/http://www.pcgamer.com/reviews/943.html | archivedate=February 26, 2000 | title=''Sid Meier's Colonization'' | date=January 1995 | url-status=dead }}</ref>\n| CGW = {{Rating|3.5|5}}<ref name=cgw>{{cite journal| author=Black, Randall |title=Toiling for Lady Liberty |date=December 1994 |issue=125| journal=[[Computer Gaming World]] | pages=304, 306, 307, 309, 310 }}</ref>\n| NGen = {{rating|4|5}}<ref name=nextgen>{{cite journal |author=Staff | title=Rating; ''Colonization'' |journal=[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]] |issue=1 |page=94 |date=January 1995}}</ref>\n}}\n\nSales of ''Sid Meier's Colonization'' surpassed 350,000 copies by September 1997.<ref name=salesbatch>{{cite press release | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/19980120114349/http://www.microprose.com/corporatedesign/press/conquer.html | url=http://www.microprose.com:80/corporatedesign/press/conquer.html | title=Microprose Ships ''Conquer the Skies'' and ''Conquer the World'', Two Compilations of Top-Selling, Award-Winning Simulation and Strategy Games | date=September 16, 1997 | archivedate=January 20, 1998 | publisher=[[Microprose]] | location=[[Alameda, California]] | url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nIn 1996, ''Colonization'' was ranked the fourth best game of all time by ''[[Amiga Power]]''.<ref>Amiga Power magazine issue 64, [[Future Publishing]], August 1996.</ref> It was named the 52nd best computer game ever by ''[[PC Gamer UK]]'' in 1997.<ref name=pcgameruktop100>{{cite journal |author1=Flynn, James |author2=Owen, Steve |author3=Pierce, Matthew |author4=Davis, Jonathan |author5=Longhurst, Richard | journal=[[PC Gamer UK]] | title=The ''PC Gamer'' Top 100 |date=July 1997 | issue=45 | pages=51\u201383 }}</ref>\n\n''[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]'' stated that \"MPS Labs borrowed heavily from classic hits of the past to create a surprisingly addictive title with a flavor all its own.\"<ref name=nextgen/>\n\n{{-}}\n\n==Remakes==\n''[[FreeCol]]'' released in 2003, is an [[Open-source video game|open-source]] and [[fan-made]] [[Video game remake|remake]] of ''Colonization''.<ref>[https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2008/06/12/get-ur-freecol/ Get Ur FreeCol] by Alec Meer on [[Rock, Paper, Shotgun]] ''\"it\u2019s an remarkable accomplishment, and I\u2019m very glad it\u2019s out there.

It was released on March 23, 2004 on [[Stones Throw Records]]. The album was recorded between 2002 and 2004 and was produced entirely by Madlib, with the exception of \"The Illest Villains\" which was produced by both Madlib and Doom. Madlib created most of the album's instrumentals during a trip to [[Brazil]], where the production was composed in his hotel room using minimal amounts of equipment: a [[Boss SP-303]], a [[turntable]], and a tape deck.<ref>https://www.stonesthrow.com/news/2005/05/mad-skills</ref> Fourteen months before the album was officially released, an unfinished demo of the album was stolen and leaked onto the internet. Frustrated over the leak, the duo stopped working on the album and returned to it only after they released other solo projects.\n\nWhile ''Madvillainy'' achieved only moderate commercial success, it still became one of the label's best-selling albums. The album peaked at number 179 on the US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]], and attracted much attention from media outlets not usually covering [[hip hop music]], including ''[[The New Yorker]]''. ''Madvillainy'' received rave reviews from most music critics, who praised both Doom's lyricism and Madlib's production. \n\nRecently, thanks to greater accessibility enabled by online streaming services, the album has been widely accepted to be one of the greatest albums of the all-time. Some consider the collaboration, between iconic production and pure lyricism, to be a crown jewel of the genre (\"sui generis\"). The album has also appeared in various publications' lists of the best albums, including ''[[NME]]'' magazine's list of [[NME's The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time|the 500 greatest albums of all time]].\n\n== Background ==\nIn 1997, after the death of his brother [[DJ Subroc]] and the rejection of [[KMD]]'s album ''[[Black Bastards]]'' by [[Elektra Records]], rapper Zev Love X returned to music as the masked rapper MF Doom.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Hultkrans|first1=Andrew|title=MF Doom, \u2018Operation: Doomsday\u2019 (Metal Face)|url=http://www.spin.com/2011/04/mf-doom-operation-doomsday-metal-face/|website=[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]|accessdate=17 August 2016|date=19 April 2011}}</ref> In 1999, he released his debut solo album ''[[Operation: Doomsday]]'' on [[Fondle 'Em Records]].<ref>{{cite web|last1=Fields|first1=Kiah|title=Today In Hip Hop History: MF Doom Releases Debut \u2018Operation: Doomsday\u2019 17 Years Ago|url=http://thesource.com/2016/04/20/today-in-hip-hop-history-mf-doom-releases-debut-operation-doomsday-17-years-ago/|website=[[The Source]]|accessdate=17 August 2016|date=20 April 2016}}</ref> According to [[Nathan Rabin]] of ''[[The A.V.

During that time, he lived between [[Long Island]], [[New York (state)|New York]], and the [[Kennesaw]] suburb of [[Atlanta]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]]. Coincidentally, Eothen \"Egon\" Alapatt, who was the manager of Madlib's label [[Stones Throw Records]], had a friend in Kennesaw. He asked the friend to give Doom (who didn't know about Madlib and Stones Throw at the time) some instrumentals from Madlib. Three weeks later, the friend called back, telling him that Doom loved the instrumentals and wanted to work with Madlib. Soon, one of Doom's \"quasi-managers\" made an offer, asking for plane tickets to Los Angeles and $1,500. Despite the fact that label didn't have enough money after buying the tickets, they immediately agreed. According to Egon, soon after arrival, the manager went to him demanding money, while Doom visited Madlib:<ref name=\"searching_for_tomorrow\" />\n\n{{quote|The first thing his manager did was get me in my bedroom, which was also the office, and corner me about the 1,500 bucks. I realized that if she was in here, then Doom was with [Madlib], and the longer I kept up this charade with her, the longer they\u2019ll vibe and maybe it all might work out.}}\n\nEgon's plan was successful, and Doom and Madlib began working together. Soon after, Stones Throw Records managed to collect the money necessary to pay Doom and a contract to the label was signed, which was written on a paper plate.<ref name=\"searching_for_tomorrow\" />\n\n==Recording==\nDoom and Madlib started working on ''Madvillainy'' in 2002. Madlib created one hundred beats in a matter of weeks, some of which were used on ''Madvillainy'', some were used on his collaboration album with J Dilla ''[[Champion Sound]]'', while others were used for [[M.E.D. (rapper)|M.E.D.]]'s and [[Dudley Perkins (rapper)|Dudley Perkins]]' albums. Even though Stones Throw booked Doom a hotel room, he spent most of the time in Madlib's studio, based in an old bomb shelter in [[Mount Washington, Los Angeles]].

Madlib released ''[[Champion Sound]]'' with J Dilla, while Doom released two solo albums: ''[[Take Me to Your Leader (King Geedorah album)|Take Me to Your Leader]]'', as King Geedorah, and ''[[Vaudeville Villain]]'', as Viktor Vaughn. Nevertheless, after the release of these albums, they decided to return to ''Madvillainy''. For the final version of the album, Doom altered his voice, described by [[Peanut Butter Wolf]] as going from \"really hyper, more enthusiastic\" to \"a more mellow, relaxed, confident, less abrasive\", and changed some lyrics to coincide with this change. Madlib was also asked by the label to change some instrumentals, but told them that he forgot the samples he used, in order to allow for them to remain on the album. Additionally, the label also requested the duo make a proper ending for the album, forcing them to rent a studio for the recording of \"Rhinestone Cowboy\".<ref name=\"searching_for_tomorrow\" /> The beat used, however, was produced in Brazil.<ref>{{cite web|title=The 100 Best Albums of the 2000s|url=http://uk.complex.com/music/2011/11/the-100-best-albums-of-the-2000s/56|website=[[Complex (magazine)|Complex]]|accessdate=18 August 2016}}</ref>\n\n===Production===\n[[File:MadlibMarch2014Echo (cropped).jpg|thumb|left|Madlib (''pictured in 2014''), producer of the album and half of the duo]]\n''Madvillainy'' was produced almost entirely by [[Madlib]], except the first track, which he produced in collaboration with Doom.<ref name=\"HHDX_10year\" /> On the album, Madlib incorporates his distinctive [[Hip hop production|production]] style, based on using [[Sample (music)|samples]],<ref>{{cite web|title=Today in Hip-Hop: MF Doom and Madlib Drop 'Madvillainy'|url=http://www.xxlmag.com/news/2015/03/today-hip-hop-mf-doom-madlib-dropped-madvillainy/|website=[[XXL (magazine)|XXL]]|accessdate=24 August 2016}}</ref> mostly obscure, from albums recorded in different countries.<ref>{{cite book |editor-last=Garrett|editor-first=Charles Hiroshi|date=2013|title=The Grove Dictionary of American Music|title-link=The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians|edition=2nd|url= |location= |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|page=|isbn=9780195314281|quote=He is best known for his unique approach to beatmaking and remixing which includes aggregating diverse material together from far-flung musical traditions.}}</ref> Aside from sampling records by American artists,<ref>{{cite web|last1=Oliver|first1=Matt|title=Shadows Of Today: Ten Years Of 'Madvillainy'|url=http://www.clashmusic.com/features/shadows-of-today-ten-years-of-madvillainy|website=[[Clash (magazine)|Clash]]|accessdate=24 August 2016}}</ref> namely from [[jazz]]<ref name=\"popmatters\" /> and [[Soul music|soul]],<ref name=\"Stereogum_Turns10\" /> Madlib also used [[Music of India|Indian]] (for example, \"Shadows of Tomorrow\" samples \"Hindu Hoon Main Na Musalman Hoon\" by [[R.

Despite this, Jank stuck with the original artwork, labeling it as the \"rap version of ''[[Beauty and the Beast]]''\".

It was released on March 23, 2004 on [[Stones Throw Records]]. The album was recorded between 2002 and 2004 and was produced entirely by Madlib, with the exception of \"The Illest Villains\" which was produced by both Madlib and Doom. Madlib created most of the album's instrumentals during a trip to [[Brazil]], where the production was composed in his hotel room using minimal amounts of equipment: a [[Boss SP-303]], a [[turntable]], and a tape deck.<ref>https://www.stonesthrow.com/news/2005/05/mad-skills</ref> Fourteen months before the album was officially released, an unfinished demo of the album was stolen and leaked onto the internet. Frustrated over the leak, the duo stopped working on the album and returned to it only after they released other solo projects.\n\nWhile ''Madvillainy'' achieved only moderate commercial success, it still became one of the label's best-selling albums. The album peaked at number 179 on the US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]], and attracted much attention from media outlets not usually covering [[hip hop music]], including ''[[The New Yorker]]''. ''Madvillainy'' received rave reviews from most music critics, who praised both Doom's lyricism and Madlib's production. The album has appeared in various publications' lists of the best albums, including ''[[NME]]'' magazine's list of [[NME's The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time|the 500 greatest albums of all time]].\n\n== Background ==\nIn 1997, after the death of his brother [[DJ Subroc]] and the rejection of [[KMD]]'s album ''[[Black Bastards]]'' by [[Elektra Records]], rapper Zev Love X returned to music as the masked rapper MF Doom.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Hultkrans|first1=Andrew|title=MF Doom, \u2018Operation: Doomsday\u2019 (Metal Face)|url=http://www.spin.com/2011/04/mf-doom-operation-doomsday-metal-face/|website=[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]|accessdate=17 August 2016|date=19 April 2011}}</ref> In 1999, he released his debut solo album ''[[Operation: Doomsday]]'' on [[Fondle 'Em Records]].<ref>{{cite web|last1=Fields|first1=Kiah|title=Today In Hip Hop History: MF Doom Releases Debut \u2018Operation: Doomsday\u2019 17 Years Ago|url=http://thesource.com/2016/04/20/today-in-hip-hop-history-mf-doom-releases-debut-operation-doomsday-17-years-ago/|website=[[The Source]]|accessdate=17 August 2016|date=20 April 2016}}</ref> According to [[Nathan Rabin]] of ''[[The A.V.

During that time, he lived between [[Long Island]], [[New York (state)|New York]], and the [[Kennesaw]] suburb of [[Atlanta]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]]. Coincidentally, Eothen \"Egon\" Alapatt, who was the manager of Madlib's label [[Stones Throw Records]], had a friend in Kennesaw. He asked the friend to give Doom (who didn't know about Madlib and Stones Throw at the time) some instrumentals from Madlib. Three weeks later, the friend called back, telling him that Doom loved the instrumentals and wanted to work with Madlib. Soon, one of Doom's \"quasi-managers\" made an offer, asking for plane tickets to Los Angeles and $1,500. Despite the fact that label didn't have enough money after buying the tickets, they immediately agreed. According to Egon, soon after arrival, the manager went to him demanding money, while Doom visited Madlib:<ref name=\"searching_for_tomorrow\" />\n\n{{quote|The first thing his manager did was get me in my bedroom, which was also the office, and corner me about the 1,500 bucks. I realized that if she was in here, then Doom was with [Madlib], and the longer I kept up this charade with her, the longer they\u2019ll vibe and maybe it all might work out.}}\n\nEgon's plan was successful, and Doom and Madlib began working together. Soon after, Stones Throw Records managed to collect the money necessary to pay Doom and a contract to the label was signed, which was written on a paper plate.<ref name=\"searching_for_tomorrow\" />\n\n==Recording==\nDoom and Madlib started working on ''Madvillainy'' in 2002. Madlib created one hundred beats in a matter of weeks, some of which were used on ''Madvillainy'', some were used on his collaboration album with J Dilla ''[[Champion Sound]]'', while others were used for [[M.E.D. (rapper)|M.E.D.]]'s and [[Dudley Perkins (rapper)|Dudley Perkins]]' albums. Even though Stones Throw booked Doom a hotel room, he spent most of the time in Madlib's studio, based in an old bomb shelter in [[Mount Washington, Los Angeles]]. When the duo wasn't working on the album, they were spending free time together, drinking beer, eating [[Thai food]], [[smoking marijuana]],<ref name=\"searching_for_tomorrow\" /> and taking [[psychedelic mushrooms]].<ref>{{cite interview |last= Jackson|first= Otis|subject-link= Madlib|interviewer= Jeff \"Chairman\" Mao|title= Madlib Lecture|url= https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXkPPnVUm2E|location= [[New York City]]|date= 2016|work= [[Red Bull Music Academy]]|access-date=2016-08-18}}</ref> \"Figaro\" and \"Meat Grinder\" were among the songs recorded during this time.<ref>{{cite web|title=Madvillain - Madvillainy 2LP|url=http://www.stonesthrow.com/news/2013/04/madvillain-madvillainy-2LP|publisher=[[Stones Throw]]|accessdate=17 August 2016}}</ref>\n\nIn November 2002, Madlib went to [[Brazil]] to participate in a [[Red Bull Music Academy]] lecture,<ref name=\"Pitchfork\"/> where he debuted the first music from the album by playing an unfinished version of \"America's Most Blunted\".<ref name=\"AVClub_decade_old\">{{cite web|last1=Thurm|first1=Eric|title=A decade on, Madvillainy is still a masterpiece from hip-hop\u2019s illest duo|url=https://www.avclub.com/article/decade-madvillainy-still-masterpiece-hip-hops-ille-202027|website=[[The A.V.

Most of the album,<ref name=\"scratch\" /> including beats for \"Strange Ways\", \"Raid\", and \"Rhinestone Cowboy\", was produced in his hotel room in [[S\u00e3o Paulo]], using a portable [[phonograph|turntable]], a cassette deck, and a [[Roland SP-303|Boss SP-303]] sampler.<ref name=\"searching_for_tomorrow\" /> While Madlib was working on the album in Brazil, the unfinished demo was stolen and leaked on the internet, 14 months before its official release.

Madlib released ''[[Champion Sound]]'' with J Dilla, while Doom released two solo albums: ''[[Take Me to Your Leader (King Geedorah album)|Take Me to Your Leader]]'', as King Geedorah, and ''[[Vaudeville Villain]]'', as Viktor Vaughn. Nevertheless, after the release of these albums, they decided to return to ''Madvillainy''. For the final version of the album, Doom altered his voice, described by [[Peanut Butter Wolf]] as going from \"really hyper, more enthusiastic\" to \"a more mellow, relaxed, confident, less abrasive\", and changed some lyrics to coincide with this change. Madlib was also asked by the label to change some instrumentals, but told them that he forgot the samples he used, in order to allow for them to remain on the album. Additionally, the label also requested the duo make a proper ending for the album, forcing them to rent a studio for the recording of \"Rhinestone Cowboy\".<ref name=\"searching_for_tomorrow\" /> The beat used, however, was produced in Brazil.<ref>{{cite web|title=The 100 Best Albums of the 2000s|url=http://uk.complex.com/music/2011/11/the-100-best-albums-of-the-2000s/56|website=[[Complex (magazine)|Complex]]|accessdate=18 August 2016}}</ref>\n\n===Production===\n[[File:MadlibMarch2014Echo (cropped).jpg|thumb|left|Madlib (''pictured in 2014''), producer of the album and half of the duo]]\n''Madvillainy'' was produced almost entirely by [[Madlib]], except the first track, which he produced in collaboration with Doom.<ref name=\"HHDX_10year\" /> On the album, Madlib incorporates his distinctive [[Hip hop production|production]] style, based on using [[Sample (music)|samples]],<ref>{{cite web|title=Today in Hip-Hop: MF Doom and Madlib Drop 'Madvillainy'|url=http://www.xxlmag.com/news/2015/03/today-hip-hop-mf-doom-madlib-dropped-madvillainy/|website=[[XXL (magazine)|XXL]]|accessdate=24 August 2016}}</ref> mostly obscure, from albums recorded in different countries.<ref>{{cite book |editor-last=Garrett|editor-first=Charles Hiroshi|date=2013|title=The Grove Dictionary of American Music|title-link=The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians|edition=2nd|url= |location= |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|page=|isbn=9780195314281|quote=He is best known for his unique approach to beatmaking and remixing which includes aggregating diverse material together from far-flung musical traditions.}}</ref> Aside from sampling records by American artists,<ref>{{cite web|last1=Oliver|first1=Matt|title=Shadows Of Today: Ten Years Of 'Madvillainy'|url=http://www.clashmusic.com/features/shadows-of-today-ten-years-of-madvillainy|website=[[Clash (magazine)|Clash]]|accessdate=24 August 2016}}</ref> namely from [[jazz]]<ref name=\"popmatters\" /> and [[Soul music|soul]],<ref name=\"Stereogum_Turns10\" /> Madlib also used [[Music of India|Indian]] (for example, \"Shadows of Tomorrow\" samples \"Hindu Hoon Main Na Musalman Hoon\" by [[R.

While working on the ''Madvillainy'' album cover, Jank drew inspiration from [[King Crimson]]'s ''[[In the Court of the Crimson King]]'' artwork, however, following its completion, he noticed the artwork eerily resembled [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]]'s ''[[Madonna (Madonna album)|Madonna]]'' artwork. Despite this, Jank stuck with the original artwork, labeling it as the \"rap version of ''[[Beauty and the Beast]]''\".

{"title_page": "Parable of the Good Samaritan", "text_new": "{{Redirect|Good Samaritan||The Good Samaritan (disambiguation)}}\n{{external links|date=August 2016}}\n[[File:Jordaens Podhorce.jpg|thumb|280px|''The Good Samaritan'' by [[Jacob Jordaens]], c. 1616]] \nThe '''parable of the Good Samaritan''' is a [[Parables of Jesus|parable told by Jesus]] in the [[Gospel of Luke]].<ref>{{bibleverse|Luke|10:25\u201337|NIV}}.</ref> It is about a traveller who is stripped of clothing, beaten, and left half dead alongside the road. First a [[Kohen|priest]] and then a [[Levite]] comes by, but both avoid the man. Finally, a [[Samaritan]] happens upon the traveller. Samaritans and Jews despised each other, but the Samaritan helps the injured man. [[Jesus]] is described as telling the [[parable]] in response to the question from a lawyer, \"And who is my neighbour?\". In response, Jesus tells the parable, the conclusion of which is that the neighbour figure in the parable is the man who shows mercy to the injured man\u2014that is, the Samaritan.<ref>{{Cite book|title=An Exposition of the Old Testament|last=Gill|first=John|publisher=Baker Books|isbn=978-0801037566|location=|date=1980|pages=}}</ref>\n\nSome Christians, such as [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]], have interpreted the parable allegorically, with the Samaritan representing Jesus Christ, who saves the sinful soul.<ref name=\"Caird, G. B. 1980 p. 165\">Caird, G. B. (1980). The Language and Imagery of the Bible. Duckworth. p. 165.</ref> Others, however, discount this [[allegory]] as unrelated to the parable's original meaning<ref name=\"Caird, G. B. 1980 p. 165\"/> and see the parable as exemplifying the ethics of Jesus.<ref name = \"Sanders p6\">Sanders, E. P. The historical figure of Jesus. Penguin, 1993. p. 6.</ref>\n\nThe parable has inspired painting, sculpture dead people ont the road like to be left alone, and film. The phrase \"[[Wikt: Good Samaritan|good Samaritan]]\", meaning someone who helps a stranger, derives from this parable, and many [[Good Samaritan Hospital (disambiguation)|hospitals]] and charitable organizations are named after the Good Samaritan.\n\n==Narrative==\nIn the [[Luke 10|Gospel of Luke chapter 10]], the parable is introduced by a question, known as the [[Great Commandment]]:\n\n{{quotation||Luke 10:25-29, [[World English Bible]]|text=Behold, a certain [[Rabbi|lawyer]]  stood up and tested him, saying, \"Teacher, what shall I do to inherit eternal life?\"\n\nHe said to him, \"What is written in the law? How do you read it?\"\n\nHe answered, \u201cYou shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, with all your strength, and with all your mind; and your neighbour as yourself.\"\n\nHe said to him, \"You have answered correctly. Do this, and you will live.\"\n\nBut he, desiring to justify himself, asked Jesus, \"Who is my neighbor?\"}}\n\nJesus replies with a story:\n{{quotation||Luke 10:30\u201337, [[World English Bible]]|text=Jesus answered, \"A certain man was going down from [[Jerusalem]] to [[Jericho]], and he fell among robbers, who both stripped him and beat him, and departed, leaving him half dead. By chance a certain priest was going down that way. When he saw him, he passed by on the other side. In the same way a [[Levite]] also, when he came to the place, and saw him, passed by on the other side. But a certain [[Samaritan]], as he travelled, came where he was. When he saw him, he was moved with compassion, came to him, and bound up his wounds, pouring on  oil and wine. He set him on his own animal, and brought him to an inn, and took care of him. On the next day, when he departed, he took out two [[denarii]], gave them to the host, and said to him, 'Take care of him. Whatever you spend beyond that, I will repay you when I return.' Now which of these three do you think seemed to be a neighbor to him who fell among the robbers?\"\n\nHe said, \"He who showed mercy on him.\"\nThen Jesus said to him, \"Go and do likewise.\"}}\n\n==Historical context==\n[[File:OldRoadFromJerusalemToJericho.jpg|thumb|240px|The road from [[Jerusalem]] to [[Jericho]].]]\n\n===Road from Jerusalem to Jericho===\nIn the time of Jesus, the road from Jerusalem to Jericho was notorious for its danger and difficulty, and was known as the \"Way of Blood\" because \"of the blood which is often shed there by robbers\".<ref>Wilkinson, \"The Way from Jerusalem to Jericho\" The Biblical Archaeologist, Vol. 38, No. 1 (Mar., 1975), pp. 10\u201324</ref> [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]], in his \"[[I've Been to the Mountaintop]]\" speech, on the day before his death, described the road as follows:\n\n<blockquote>I remember when Mrs. King and I were first in Jerusalem. We rented a car and drove from Jerusalem down to Jericho. And as soon as we got on that road, I said to my wife, \"I can see why Jesus used this as the setting for his parable.\" It's a winding, meandering road. It's really conducive for ambushing. You start out in Jerusalem, which is about 1200 miles -- or rather 1200 feet above sea level. And by the time you get down to Jericho, fifteen or twenty minutes later, you're about 2200 feet below sea level.

Today, the story is often recast in a more modern setting where the people are ones in equivalent social groups known not to interact comfortably. Thus, cast appropriately, the parable regains its message to modern listeners: namely, that an individual of a social group they disapprove of can exhibit moral behavior that is superior to individuals of the groups they approve. Christians have used it as an example of Christianity's opposition to racial, ethnic, and sectarian prejudice.<ref>''Karl Barth's theological exegesis'' by Richard E.

According to them, under the figure of a wounded man is described the condition of Adam after the fall; from which they infer that the power of acting well was not wholly extinguished in him; because he is said to be only half-dead. As if it had been the design of Christ, in this passage, to speak of the corruption of human nature, and to inquire whether the wound which Satan inflicted on Adam were deadly or curable; nay, as if he had not plainly, and without a figure, declared in another passage, that all are dead, but those whom he quickens by his voice ({{bibleverse|John|5:25|NIV}}). As little plausibility belongs to another allegory, which, however, has been so highly satisfactory, that it has been admitted by almost universal consent, as if it had been a revelation from heaven. This Samaritan they imagine to be Christ, because he is our guardian; and they tell us that wine was poured, along with oil, into the wound, because Christ cures us by repentance and by a promise of grace. They have contrived a third subtlety, that Christ does not immediately restore health, but sends us to the Church, as an innkeeper, to be gradually cured. I acknowledge that I have no liking for any of these interpretations; but we ought to have a deeper reverence for Scripture than to reckon ourselves at liberty to disguise its natural meaning. And, indeed, any one may see that the curiosity of certain men has led them to contrive these speculations, contrary to the intention of Christ.<ref name=\"CalvinHarmony\">[[John Calvin]], ''[http://www.ccel.org/ccel/calvin/calcom33.ii.vii.html Commentary on Matthew, Mark, Luke \u2013 Volume 3]''.</ref>}}\n\n[[Francis Schaeffer]] suggested: \"Christians are not to love their believing brothers to the exclusion of their non-believing fellowmen.

Some have suggested that [[religious tolerance]] was an important message of the parable. By selecting for the moral protagonist of the story someone whose religion (Samaritanism) was despised by the Jewish audience to which Jesus was speaking, some argue that the parable attempts to downplay religious differences in favor of focusing on moral character and good works.<ref>{{cite book | author=Smith, John Hunter | title=Greek Testament lessons, consisting chiefly of the Sermon on the mount, and the parables of our Lord.

By contrasting the noble acts of a despised religion to the crass and selfish acts of a priest and a Levite, two representatives of the Jewish religious establishment, some argue that the parable attempts to downplay the importance of status in the religious hierarchy (or importance of knowledge of scripture) in favor of the practice of religious principles.<ref>{{cite book | author=Andrews, Dave | title=Not Religion but Love: Practicing a Radical Spirituality of Compassion | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oTxNAwAAQBAJ | publisher=Wipf and Stock Publishers | year=2012 | page=117| isbn=9781610978514 }}<br />{{cite book | author=Wilson, Jared C. | title=The Storytelling God: Seeing the Glory of Jesus in His Parables | publisher=Crossway | year=2014 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2pneAgAAQBAJ | page=88| isbn=9781433536717 }}</ref>\n\n====Modern Jewish view====\n''The following is based on the public domain article [http://jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=1509&letter=B&search=great%20commandment Brotherly Love] found in the 1906 [[Jewish Encyclopedia]]''\n{{Further|Jewish views on love|Chesed}}\n\nThe story of the good Samaritan, in the Pauline Gospel of Luke x. 25-37, related to illustrate the meaning of the word \"neighbor,\" possesses a feature which puzzles the student of rabbinical lore. The kind Samaritan who comes to the rescue of the men that had fallen among the robbers, is contrasted with the unkind priest and Levite; whereas the third class of Jews\u2014i.e., the ordinary Israelites who, as a rule, follow the Cohen and the Levite are omitted; and therefore suspicion is aroused regarding the original form of the story. If \"Samaritan\" has been substituted by the anti-Judean gospel-writer for the original \"Israelite,\" no reflection was intended by Jesus upon Jewish teaching concerning the meaning of neighbor; and the lesson implied is that he who is in need must be the object of our love.\n\nThe term \"neighbor\" has not at all times been thus understood by Jewish teachers.<ref>Several recognize that Lev 19:18  exclusively refers to the Israelitish neighbor (e.g., Stade, \"Gesch. des Volkes Israel,\" i. 510a). This debate is reflected in the question by the Jewish Torah expert re the definition of \"neighbor\" in Lev 19:18 (Luke 10:29).</ref> In Tanna debe Eliyahu R. xv. it is said: \"Blessed be the Lord who is impartial toward all. He says: 'Thou shalt not defraud thy neighbor. Thy neighbor is like thy brother, and thy brother is like thy neighbor.'\" Likewise in xxviii.: \"Thou shalt love the Lord thy God\"; that is, thou shalt make the name of God beloved to the creatures by a righteous conduct toward Gentiles as well as Jews (compare Sifre, Deut. 32). Aaron b. Abraham ibn \u1e24ayyim of the sixteenth century, in his commentary to Sifre, l.c.; \u1e24ayyim Vital, the cabalist, in his \"Sha'are \u1e32edushah,\" i. 5; and Moses \u1e24agis of the eighteenth century, in his work on the 613 commandments, while commenting on Deut. xxiii. 7, teach alike that the law of love of the neighbor includes the non-Israelite as well as the Israelite. There is nowhere a dissenting opinion expressed by Jewish writers.

In the same way a [[Levite]] also, when he came to the place, and saw him, passed by on the other side. But a certain [[Samaritan]], as he travelled, came where he was. When he saw him, he was moved with compassion, came to him, and bound up his wounds, pouring on  oil and wine. He set him on his own animal, and brought him to an inn, and took care of him. On the next day, when he departed, he took out two [[denarii]], gave them to the host, and said to him, 'Take care of him. Whatever you spend beyond that, I will repay you when I return.'

We rented a car and drove from Jerusalem down to Jericho. And as soon as we got on that road, I said to my wife, \"I can see why Jesus used this as the setting for his parable.\" It's a winding, meandering road. It's really conducive for ambushing. You start out in Jerusalem, which is about 1200 miles -- or rather 1200 feet above sea level.

Today, the story is often recast in a more modern setting where the people are ones in equivalent social groups known not to interact comfortably. Thus, cast appropriately, the parable regains its message to modern listeners: namely, that an individual of a social group they disapprove of can exhibit moral behavior that is superior to individuals of the groups they approve.

According to them, under the figure of a wounded man is described the condition of Adam after the fall; from which they infer that the power of acting well was not wholly extinguished in him; because he is said to be only half-dead. As if it had been the design of Christ, in this passage, to speak of the corruption of human nature, and to inquire whether the wound which Satan inflicted on Adam were deadly or curable; nay, as if he had not plainly, and without a figure, declared in another passage, that all are dead, but those whom he quickens by his voice ({{bibleverse|John|5:25|NIV}}). As little plausibility belongs to another allegory, which, however, has been so highly satisfactory, that it has been admitted by almost universal consent, as if it had been a revelation from heaven. This Samaritan they imagine to be Christ, because he is our guardian; and they tell us that wine was poured, along with oil, into the wound, because Christ cures us by repentance and by a promise of grace. They have contrived a third subtlety, that Christ does not immediately restore health, but sends us to the Church, as an innkeeper, to be gradually cured. I acknowledge that I have no liking for any of these interpretations; but we ought to have a deeper reverence for Scripture than to reckon ourselves at liberty to disguise its natural meaning. And, indeed, any one may see that the curiosity of certain men has led them to contrive these speculations, contrary to the intention of Christ.<ref name=\"CalvinHarmony\">[[John Calvin]], ''[http://www.ccel.org/ccel/calvin/calcom33.ii.vii.html Commentary on Matthew, Mark, Luke \u2013 Volume 3]''.</ref>}}\n\n[[Francis Schaeffer]] suggested: \"Christians are not to love their believing brothers to the exclusion of their non-believing fellowmen.

Some have suggested that [[religious tolerance]] was an important message of the parable. By selecting for the moral protagonist of the story someone whose religion (Samaritanism) was despised by the Jewish audience to which Jesus was speaking, some argue that the parable attempts to downplay religious differences in favor of focusing on moral character and good works.<ref>{{cite book | author=Smith, John Hunter | title=Greek Testament lessons, consisting chiefly of the Sermon on the mount, and the parables of our Lord.

By contrasting the noble acts of a despised religion to the crass and selfish acts of a priest and a Levite, two representatives of the Jewish religious establishment, some argue that the parable attempts to downplay the importance of status in the religious hierarchy (or importance of knowledge of scripture) in favor of the practice of religious principles.<ref>{{cite book | author=Andrews, Dave | title=Not Religion but Love: Practicing a Radical Spirituality of Compassion | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oTxNAwAAQBAJ | publisher=Wipf and Stock Publishers | year=2012 | page=117| isbn=9781610978514 }}<br />{{cite book | author=Wilson, Jared C. | title=The Storytelling God: Seeing the Glory of Jesus in His Parables | publisher=Crossway | year=2014 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2pneAgAAQBAJ | page=88| isbn=9781433536717 }}</ref>\n\n====Modern Jewish view====\n''The following is based on the public domain article [http://jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=1509&letter=B&search=great%20commandment Brotherly Love] found in the 1906 [[Jewish Encyclopedia]]''\n{{Further|Jewish views on love|Chesed}}\n\nThe story of the good Samaritan, in the Pauline Gospel of Luke x. 25-37, related to illustrate the meaning of the word \"neighbor,\" possesses a feature which puzzles the student of rabbinical lore. The kind Samaritan who comes to the rescue of the men that had fallen among the robbers, is contrasted with the unkind priest and Levite; whereas the third class of Jews\u2014i.e., the ordinary Israelites who, as a rule, follow the Cohen and the Levite are omitted; and therefore suspicion is aroused regarding the original form of the story. If \"Samaritan\" has been substituted by the anti-Judean gospel-writer for the original \"Israelite,\" no reflection was intended by Jesus upon Jewish teaching concerning the meaning of neighbor; and the lesson implied is that he who is in need must be the object of our love.\n\nThe term \"neighbor\" has not at all times been thus understood by Jewish teachers.<ref>Several recognize that Lev 19:18  exclusively refers to the Israelitish neighbor (e.g., Stade, \"Gesch. des Volkes Israel,\" i. 510a). This debate is reflected in the question by the Jewish Torah expert re the definition of \"neighbor\" in Lev 19:18 (Luke 10:29).</ref> In Tanna debe Eliyahu R. xv. it is said: \"Blessed be the Lord who is impartial toward all. He says: 'Thou shalt not defraud thy neighbor. Thy neighbor is like thy brother, and thy brother is like thy neighbor.'\" Likewise in xxviii.: \"Thou shalt love the Lord thy God\"; that is, thou shalt make the name of God beloved to the creatures by a righteous conduct toward Gentiles as well as Jews (compare Sifre, Deut. 32). Aaron b. Abraham ibn \u1e24ayyim of the sixteenth century, in his commentary to Sifre, l.c.; \u1e24ayyim Vital, the cabalist, in his \"Sha'are \u1e32edushah,\" i. 5; and Moses \u1e24agis of the eighteenth century, in his work on the 613 commandments, while commenting on Deut. xxiii. 7, teach alike that the law of love of the neighbor includes the non-Israelite as well as the Israelite. There is nowhere a dissenting opinion expressed by Jewish writers. For modern times, see among others the conservative opinion of Plessner's religious catechism, \"Dat Mosheh we-Yehudit,\" p.&nbsp;258.\n\nAccordingly, the synod at [[Leipzig]] in 1869, and the German-Israelitish Union of Congregations in 1885, stood on old historical ground when declaring (Lazarus, \"Ethics of Judaism,\" i. 234, 302) that \"'Love thy neighbor as thyself' is a command of all-embracing love, and is a fundamental principle of the Jewish religion\"; and Stade, when charging with imposture the rabbis who made this declaration, is entirely in error (see his \"Geschichte des Volkes Israel,\" l.c.).\n\n=={{anchor|Historical reliability}} Authenticity==\n[[File:Aime-Morot-Le-bon-Samaritain.JPG|thumb|200px|''The Good Samaritan'' by [[Aim\u00e9 Morot]] (1880) shows the Good Samaritan taking the injured man to the inn.]]\n\nThe [[Jesus Seminar]] voted this parable to be authentic,<ref name = \"5GLuke\">[[Robert W.

After lunch, Marion returns to work, where a client leaves a $40,000 ({{Inflation|US|40000|1959|r=-3|fmt=eq}})  cash payment on a property. Marion's boss asks her to deposit the money in the bank and allows her to leave work early after she complains of a headache. Once home, she decides to steal the money and drive to Fairvale, California, where Sam lives.\n\nEn route to Fairvale, Marion stops her car on the side of the road and falls asleep. She is awakened the next morning by a state patrol trooper who follows Marion after questioning her and growing suspicious about her skittish behavior. Marion stops at a [[Bakersfield, California|Bakersfield]], California automobile dealership and trades in her [[Ford Mainline]], with its Arizona license plates, for a [[Ford Custom]] 300 with California tags. The officer spots Marion at the car dealership and eyes her suspiciously as she abruptly drives away.\n\nDuring a heavy rainstorm, Marion stops for the night at the Bates Motel. The proprietor, [[Norman Bates]], invites her to share a light dinner after she checks in. She accepts his invitation but overhears an argument between Norman and [[Norma Bates (Psycho)|his mother]] about bringing a woman into their [[Carpenter Gothic|Gothic]] home, which sits perched above the motel. Instead they eat in the motel parlor, where he tells her about his life with his mother, who is mentally ill and forbids him to have a life apart from her.\n\nMoved by Norman's story, Marion decides to drive back to Phoenix in the morning to return the stolen money, which she hides in a folded newspaper on the nightstand. As she showers, a shadowy figure stabs her to death. After seeing blood, Norman panics and runs to Marion's room, where he discovers her body. He cleans up the crime scene, putting Marion's corpse and her possessions \u2013 including (unbeknownst to him) the stolen money \u2013 into the trunk of her car and sinking it in the swamps near the motel.\n\nA week later, Marion's sister [[Lila Crane|Lila]] arrives in Fairvale and confronts Sam about Marion's whereabouts. Private investigator Milton Arbogast approaches them and confirms that Marion is wanted for stealing the $40,000. Arbogast sleuths local motels and discovers Marion spent a night at the Bates Motel. He questions Norman, whose stammering, skittishness and inconsistent answers arouse his suspicion. After Norman implies that Marion met his mother, Arbogast asks to speak with her, but Norman refuses to allow it. Arbogast updates Sam and Lila about his search for Marion and promises to phone again soon. He goes to the Bates' home in search of Norman's mother; as he reaches the top of the stairs, a mysterious figure stabs him to death.\n\nWhen Lila and Sam do not hear from Arbogast, Sam visits the motel. Sam sees a figure in the house who he assumes is Mrs. Bates, but she ignores his knocking. Lila and Sam visit the local deputy sheriff, who informs them that Mrs. Bates died in a murder-suicide ten years ago. The sheriff concludes that Arbogast lied to Sam and Lila so he could pursue Marion and the money. Convinced that some ill has befallen Arbogast, Lila and Sam drive to the motel. Norman carries his mother from her room and hides her in the fruit cellar.\n\nAt the motel, Sam distracts Norman by engaging in conversation while Lila cases the property and sneaks inside the house. After Sam grills him, Norman becomes agitated, knocks Sam out, and rushes to the house. Lila hides in the cellar, where she finds Mrs. Bates in a chair. Lila turns her around and discovers she is a mummified corpse. Lila screams as Norman runs into the cellar, holding a [[chef's knife]] and wearing his mother's clothes and a wig. Before Norman can attack Lila, Sam \u2013 having regained consciousness \u2013 subdues him.\n\nAt the courthouse, a psychiatrist explains that Norman murdered Mrs. Bates and her lover ten years ago out of jealousy. Unable to bear the guilt, he stole her corpse and began to treat it as if she were still alive. He recreated his mother in his own mind as an [[multiple personality disorder|alternate personality]], dressing in her clothes and talking to himself in her voice. This \"Mother\" personality is as jealous and possessive as Mrs. Bates was while alive: whenever Norman feels attracted to a woman, \"Mother\" kills her.

Paramount executives rejected this cost-conscious approach, claiming their sound stages were booked even though the industry was in a slump. Hitchcock countered he would personally finance the project and film it at Universal-International using his Shamley Productions crew if Paramount would merely distribute. In lieu of his usual $250,000 director's fee he proposed a 60% stake in the film negative.

Ultimately, the helicopter footage proved too shaky and had to be spliced with footage from the studio.<ref name=\"leigh2426\">Leigh, pp. 24\u201326</ref> Another crew filmed day and night footage on Highway 99 between [[Gorman, California|Gorman]] and [[Fresno]], California for projection when Marion drives from Phoenix.

The final shot in the shower scene, which starts with an extreme close-up on Marion's eye and pulls up and out, proved difficult for Leigh, since the water splashing in her face made her want to blink, and the cameraman had trouble as well since he had to manually focus while moving the camera.<ref name=autogenerated1 /> Retakes were also required for the opening scene, since Hitchcock felt that Leigh and Gavin were not passionate enough.<ref>Leigh, p. 55</ref> Leigh had trouble saying \"Not inordinately\" for the real estate office scene, requiring additional retakes.<ref>Leigh, p. 59</ref> Lastly, the scene in which \"Mother\" is discovered required a complicated coordinating of the chair turning around, Vera Miles (as Lila Crane)  hitting the light bulb, and a [[lens flare]], which proved to be the sticking point. Hitchcock forced retakes until all three elements were to his satisfaction.<ref>Leigh, pp. 87\u201388</ref>\n\nAccording to Hitchcock, a series of shots with Arbogast going up the stairs in the Bates house before he is stabbed were helmed by assistant director Hilton A. Green, working with storyboard artist Saul Bass' drawings only while Hitchcock was incapacitated with the common cold. However, upon viewing the [[dailies]] of the shots, Hitchcock was forced to scrap them. He claimed they were \"no good\" because they did not portray \"an innocent person but a sinister man who was going up those stairs\".<ref name=\"Truffaut\">{{Harvnb|Truffaut|1967|p=273}}</ref> Hitchcock later re-shot the scene, though a little of the cut footage made its way into the film. Filming the murder of Arbogast proved problematic owing to the overhead camera angle necessary to hide the film's twist.

When interviewing Hitchcock in 1967, [[Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut]] asked about the extent of Bass' contribution, to which Hitchcock replied that in addition to the titles, Bass had provided storyboards for the Arbogast murder (which he claimed to have rejected), but made no mention of Bass providing storyboards for the shower scene.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://notcoming.com/saulbass/caps_psycho.php|title=Psycho: The Title Credits|accessdate=November 20, 2010}}</ref> According to Bill Krohn's ''Hitchcock At Work'', Bass' first claim to have directed the scene was in 1970, when he provided a magazine with 48 drawings used as storyboards as proof of his contribution.<ref name=\"Krohn\">{{Harvnb|Krohn|2003}}{{Page needed|date=September 2010}}</ref>\n\nKrohn's analysis of the production of ''Psycho'' in his book ''Hitchcock at Work'', while refuting Bass' claims for directing the scene, notes that these storyboards did introduce key aspects of the final scene\u2014most notably, the fact that the killer appears as a silhouette, and details such as the close-ups of the slashing knife, Leigh's desperate outstretched arm, the shower curtain being torn off its hooks, and the transition from the hole of the drainage pipe to Marion Crane's dead eyes. Krohn notes that this final transition is highly reminiscent of the iris titles that Bass created for ''[[Vertigo (film)|Vertigo]]''.<ref name=\"Krohn\"/>\n\nKrohn's research also notes that Hitchcock shot the scene with two cameras: one a [[Mitchell Camera|BNC Mitchell]], the other a handheld French ''[[Eclair (camera)|\u00c9clair]]'' camera which [[Orson Welles]] had used in ''[[Touch of Evil]]'' (1958). In order to create an ideal montage for the greatest emotional impact on the audience, Hitchcock shot a lot of footage of this scene which he trimmed down in the editing room. He even brought a [[Moviola]] on the set to gauge the footage required. The final sequence, which his editor [[George Tomasini]] worked on with Hitchcock's advice, however did not go far beyond the basic structural elements set up by Bass' storyboards.<ref name=\"Krohn\"/>\n\nAccording to [[Donald Spoto]] in ''The Dark Side of Genius'', Hitchcock's wife, [[Alma Reville]], spotted a blooper in one of the last screenings of ''Psycho'' before its official release: after Marion was supposedly dead, one could see her blink.

This, along with box office numbers, led to a reconsideration of the film by critics, and it eventually received a large amount of praise. It broke box-office records in Japan and the rest of Asia, France, Britain, South America, the United States, and Canada, and was a moderate success in Australia for a brief period.<ref name=\"leigh99102\"/> It was the most profitable black-and-white sound film ever made,{{citation needed|date=October 2014}} and Hitchcock personally realized well in excess of $15 million. He then swapped his rights to ''Psycho'' and his TV anthology for 150,000 shares of [[MCA Inc.|MCA]], making him the third largest shareholder in MCA Inc., and his own boss at Universal, in theory; however, this did not stop them from interfering with his later films.<ref>Stephen Rebello, ''Alfred Hitchcock and the Making of Psycho, Soft Skull Press, Berkeley, 1990.</ref><ref>Leigh, p. 141</ref> ''Psycho'' was, by a large margin, the most profitable film of Hitchcock's career, earning over $32 million for the studio on release, and $18 million by the end of the year. Around the time of the run's end, the film had grossed $50 million in domestic theaters.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, the film shattered attendance records at the [[London]] Plaza [[Movie theatre|Cinema]], but nearly all British critics gave it poor reviews, questioning Hitchcock's taste and judgment. Reasons cited for this were the critics' late screenings, forcing them to rush their reviews, their dislike of the gimmicky promotion, and Hitchcock's [[expatriate]] status.<ref name=\"leigh103106\">Leigh, pp. 103\u2013106</ref> Perhaps thanks to the public's response and Hitchcock's efforts at promoting it, the critics did a re-review, and the film was praised.

The film is instead ironic as it presents \"clarity and fulfillment\" of romance. The past is central to the film; the main characters \"struggle to understand and resolve destructive personal histories\" and ultimately fail.<ref name=\"brill200\u2013201\">{{Harvnb|Brill|1988|pp=200\u2013201}}</ref> Lesley Brill writes, \"The inexorable forces of past sins and mistakes crush hopes for regeneration and present happiness.\" The crushed hope is highlighted by the death of the protagonist, Marion Crane, halfway through the film.<ref>{{Harvnb|Brill|1988|p=223}}</ref> Marion is like [[Persephone]] of [[Greek mythology]], who is abducted temporarily from the world of the living. The myth does not sustain with Marion, who dies hopelessly in her room at the Bates Motel. The room is wallpapered with floral print like Persephone's flowers, but they are only \"reflected in mirrors, as images of images\u2014twice removed from reality\". In the scene of Marion's death, Brill describes the transition from the bathroom drain to Marion's lifeless eye, \"Like the eye of the amorphous sea creature at the end of Fellini's ''[[La Dolce Vita]]'', it marks the birth of death, an emblem of final hopelessness and corruption.\" <ref name=\"brill234\">{{Harvnb|Brill|1988|p=224}}</ref>\n\nMarion is deprived of \"the humble treasures of love, marriage, home and family\", which Hitchcock considers elements of human happiness. There exists among ''Psycho''{{'}}s secondary characters a lack of \"familial warmth and stability\", which demonstrates the unlikelihood of domestic fantasies. The film contains ironic jokes about domesticity, such as when Sam writes a letter to Marion, agreeing to marry her, only after the audience sees her buried in the swamp. Sam and Marion's sister Lila, in investigating Marion's disappearance, develop an \"increasingly connubial\" relationship, a development that Marion is denied.<ref name=\"brill228\">{{Harvnb|Brill|1988|p=228}}</ref> Norman also suffers a similarly perverse definition of domesticity. He has \"an infantile and divided personality\" and lives in a mansion whose past occupies the present. Norman displays stuffed birds that are \"frozen in time\" and keeps childhood toys and stuffed animals in his room. He is hostile toward suggestions to move from the past, such as with Marion's suggestion to put\nhis mother \"someplace\" and as a result kills Marion to preserve his past. Brill explains, {{\" '}}Someplace' for Norman is where his delusions of love, home, and family are declared invalid and exposed.\"<ref>{{Harvnb|Brill|1988|p=229}}</ref>\n\nLight and darkness feature prominently in ''Psycho''. The first shot after the [[intertitle]] is the sunny landscape of Phoenix before the camera enters a dark hotel room where Sam and Marion appear as bright figures. Marion is almost immediately cast in darkness; she is preceded by her shadow as she reenters the office to steal money and as she enters her bedroom. When she flees Phoenix, darkness descends on her drive. The following sunny morning is punctured by a watchful police officer with black sunglasses, and she finally arrives at the Bates Motel in near darkness.<ref name=\"brill225\">{{Harvnb|Brill|1988|p=225}}</ref> Bright lights are also \"the ironic equivalent of darkness\" in the film, blinding instead of illuminating. Examples of brightness include the opening window shades in Sam's and Marion's hotel room, vehicle headlights at night, the neon sign at the Bates Motel, \"the glaring white\" of the bathroom tiles where Marion dies, and the fruit cellar's exposed light bulb shining on the corpse of Norman's mother. Such bright lights typically characterize danger and violence in Hitchcock's films.<ref name=\"brill225\u2013256\">{{Harvnb|Brill|1988|pp=225\u2013226}}</ref>\n\n===Motifs===\nThe film often features shadows, mirrors, windows, and, less so, water. The shadows are present from the first scene where the blinds make bars on Marion and Sam as they peer out of the window. The stuffed birds' shadows loom over Marion as she eats, and Norman's mother is seen in only shadows until the  end. More subtly, [[Backlighting (lighting design)|backlighting]] turns the rakes in the hardware store into talons above Lila's head.<ref name=\"Leigh9093\">Leigh, pp. 90\u201393</ref>\n\nMirrors reflect Marion as she packs, her eyes as she checks the rear-view mirror, her face in the policeman's sunglasses, and her hands as she counts out the money in the car dealership's bathroom. A motel window serves as a mirror by reflecting Marion and Norman together. Hitchcock shoots through Marion's windshield and the telephone booth, when Arbogast phones Sam and Lila. The heavy downpour can be seen as a foreshadowing of the shower, and its cessation can be seen as a symbol of Marion making up her mind to return to Phoenix.<ref name=\"Leigh9093\"/>\n\nThere are a number of references to birds. Marion's last name is Crane and she is from Phoenix. Norman comments that Marion eats like a bird. The motel room has pictures of birds on the wall. Brigitte Peucker also suggests that Norman's hobby of stuffing birds literalizes the British slang expression for sex, \"stuffing birds\", ''bird'' being British slang for a desirable woman.<ref>{{cite book |title=The Material Image: Art And the Real in Film |last= Peucker |first=Brigitte |authorlink= |year=2007 |publisher=Stanford University Press |location= |isbn=978-0-8047-5431-6 |page=167 |url=}}</ref> Robert Allan suggests that Norman's mother is his original \"stuffed bird\", both in the sense of having preserved her body and the incestuous nature of Norman's emotional bond with her.<ref>{{cite book |title=Hitchcock's Romantic Irony |last= Allen |first=Richard |authorlink= |year=2007 |publisher=Columbia University Press |location= |isbn=978-0-231-13575-7 |page=161 |url=}}</ref>\n\n===Psychoanalytic interpretation===\n''Psycho'' has been called \"the first [[Psychoanalysis|psychoanalytical]] thriller.\"<ref name=\"Kaganski\">{{Harvnb|Kaganski|1997}}</ref> The sex and violence in the film were unlike anything previously seen in a mainstream film. \"The shower scene is both feared and desired,\" wrote French film critic Serge Kaganski. \"Hitchcock may be scaring his female viewers out of their wits, but he is turning his male viewers into potential rapists, since Janet Leigh has been turning men on ever since she appeared in her brassiere in the first scene.\"<ref name=\"Kaganski\"/>\n\nIn his documentary ''[[The Pervert's Guide to Cinema]]'', [[Slavoj \u017di\u017eek]] remarks that Norman Bates' mansion has three floors, paralleling the three levels of the human mind that are postulated by [[Freud]]ian [[psychoanalysis]]: the top floor would be the ''[[superego]]'', where Bates' mother lives; the ground floor is then Bates' ''[[Id, ego and super-ego|ego]]'', where he functions as an apparently normal human being; and finally, the basement would be Bates' ''[[Id, ego, and super-ego|id]]''. \u017di\u017eek interprets Bates' moving his mother's corpse from top floor to basement as a symbol for the deep connection that psychoanalysis posits between superego and id.<ref>{{cite video |people= [[Sophie Fiennes|Fiennes, Sophie]] (director); [[Slavoj \u017di\u017eek|\u017di\u017eek, Slavoj]] (writer/narrator) |date = 2006|url = https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0828154|title = The Pervert's Guide to Cinema|medium= documentary |publisher=Amoeba Film}}</ref>\n\n==Recognition==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin:auto; width:100%;\"\n|-\n!

The film initially received mixed reviews, but outstanding [[box office|box-office]] returns prompted critical reevaluation. ''Psycho'' was nominated for four [[33rd Academy Awards|Academy Awards]], including [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress|Best Supporting Actress]] for Leigh and [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]] for Hitchcock.\n\n''Psycho'' is now considered one of Hitchcock's best films<ref>''Psycho'' is the top listed Hitchcock film in ''The 100 Greatest Movies of All Time'' by ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'', and the highest Hitchcock film on [[AFI's 100 Years ... 100 Movies]].</ref> and praised as a major work of cinematic art by international film critics and scholars.

In 1992, the [[Library of Congress]] deemed the film \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\" and selected it for preservation in the [[National Film Registry]].\n\n{{Use mdy dates|date=November 2019}}\n\n==Plot==\nDuring a lunchtime tryst in a [[Phoenix, Arizona]] hotel, real-estate secretary [[Marion Crane]] and her boyfriend, Sam Loomis, discuss how they cannot afford to get married because of Sam's debts. After lunch, Marion returns to work, where a client leaves a $40,000 ({{Inflation|US|40000|1959|r=-3|fmt=eq}})  cash payment on a property. Marion's boss asks her to deposit the money in the bank and allows her to leave work early after she complains of a headache. Once home, she decides to steal the money and drive to Fairvale, California, where Sam lives.\n\nEn route to Fairvale, Marion stops her car on the side of the road and falls asleep. She is awakened the next morning by a state patrol trooper who follows Marion after questioning her and growing suspicious about her skittish behavior. Marion stops at a [[Bakersfield, California|Bakersfield]], California automobile dealership and trades in her [[Ford Mainline]], with its Arizona license plates, for a [[Ford Custom]] 300 with California tags. The officer spots Marion at the car dealership and eyes her suspiciously as she abruptly drives away.\n\nDuring a heavy rainstorm, Marion stops for the night at the Bates Motel. The proprietor, [[Norman Bates]], invites her to share a light dinner after she checks in. She accepts his invitation but overhears an argument between Norman and [[Norma Bates (Psycho)|his mother]] about bringing a woman into their [[Carpenter Gothic|Gothic]] home, which sits perched above the motel. Instead they eat in the motel parlor, where he tells her about his life with his mother, who is mentally ill and forbids him to have a life apart from her.\n\nMoved by Norman's story, Marion decides to drive back to Phoenix in the morning to return the stolen money, which she hides in a folded newspaper on the nightstand. As she showers, a shadowy figure stabs her to death. After seeing blood, Norman panics and runs to Marion's room, where he discovers her body. He cleans up the crime scene, putting Marion's corpse and her possessions \u2013 including (unbeknownst to him) the stolen money \u2013 into the trunk of her car and sinking it in the swamps near the motel.\n\nA week later, Marion's sister [[Lila Crane|Lila]] arrives in Fairvale and confronts Sam about Marion's whereabouts. Private investigator Milton Arbogast approaches them and confirms that Marion is wanted for stealing the $40,000. Arbogast sleuths local motels and discovers Marion spent a night at the Bates Motel. He questions Norman, whose stammering, skittishness and inconsistent answers arouse his suspicion. After Norman implies that Marion met his mother, Arbogast asks to speak with her, but Norman refuses to allow it. Arbogast updates Sam and Lila about his search for Marion and promises to phone again soon. He goes to the Bates' home in search of Norman's mother; as he reaches the top of the stairs, a mysterious figure stabs him to death.\n\nWhen Lila and Sam do not hear from Arbogast, Sam visits the motel. Sam sees a figure in the house who he assumes is Mrs. Bates, but she ignores his knocking. Lila and Sam visit the local deputy sheriff, who informs them that Mrs. Bates died in a murder-suicide ten years ago. The sheriff concludes that Arbogast lied to Sam and Lila so he could pursue Marion and the money. Convinced that some ill has befallen Arbogast, Lila and Sam drive to the motel. Norman carries his mother from her room and hides her in the fruit cellar.\n\nAt the motel, Sam distracts Norman by engaging in conversation while Lila cases the property and sneaks inside the house. After Sam grills him, Norman becomes agitated, knocks Sam out, and rushes to the house. Lila hides in the cellar, where she finds Mrs. Bates in a chair. Lila turns her around and discovers she is a mummified corpse. Lila screams as Norman runs into the cellar, holding a [[chef's knife]] and wearing his mother's clothes and a wig. Before Norman can attack Lila, Sam \u2013 having regained consciousness \u2013 subdues him.\n\nAt the courthouse, a psychiatrist explains that Norman murdered Mrs. Bates and her lover ten years ago out of jealousy. Unable to bear the guilt, he stole her corpse and began to treat it as if she were still alive. He recreated his mother in his own mind as an [[multiple personality disorder|alternate personality]], dressing in her clothes and talking to himself in her voice. This \"Mother\" personality is as jealous and possessive as Mrs. Bates was while alive: whenever Norman feels attracted to a woman, \"Mother\" kills her.

Paramount executives rejected this cost-conscious approach, claiming their sound stages were booked even though the industry was in a slump. Hitchcock countered he would personally finance the project and film it at Universal-International using his Shamley Productions crew if Paramount would merely distribute. In lieu of his usual $250,000 director's fee he proposed a 60% stake in the film negative.

Ultimately, the helicopter footage proved too shaky and had to be spliced with footage from the studio.<ref name=\"leigh2426\">Leigh, pp. 24\u201326</ref> Another crew filmed day and night footage on Highway 99 between [[Gorman, California|Gorman]] and [[Fresno]], California for projection when Marion drives from Phoenix.

The final shot in the shower scene, which starts with an extreme close-up on Marion's eye and pulls up and out, proved difficult for Leigh, since the water splashing in her face made her want to blink, and the cameraman had trouble as well since he had to manually focus while moving the camera.<ref name=autogenerated1 /> Retakes were also required for the opening scene, since Hitchcock felt that Leigh and Gavin were not passionate enough.<ref>Leigh, p. 55</ref> Leigh had trouble saying \"Not inordinately\" for the real estate office scene, requiring additional retakes.<ref>Leigh, p. 59</ref> Lastly, the scene in which \"Mother\" is discovered required a complicated coordinating of the chair turning around, Vera Miles (as Lila Crane)  hitting the light bulb, and a [[lens flare]], which proved to be the sticking point. Hitchcock forced retakes until all three elements were to his satisfaction.<ref>Leigh, pp. 87\u201388</ref>\n\nAccording to Hitchcock, a series of shots with Arbogast going up the stairs in the Bates house before he is stabbed were helmed by assistant director Hilton A. Green, working with storyboard artist Saul Bass' drawings only while Hitchcock was incapacitated with the common cold. However, upon viewing the [[dailies]] of the shots, Hitchcock was forced to scrap them. He claimed they were \"no good\" because they did not portray \"an innocent person but a sinister man who was going up those stairs\".<ref name=\"Truffaut\">{{Harvnb|Truffaut|1967|p=273}}</ref> Hitchcock later re-shot the scene, though a little of the cut footage made its way into the film. Filming the murder of Arbogast proved problematic owing to the overhead camera angle necessary to hide the film's twist.

When interviewing Hitchcock in 1967, [[Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut]] asked about the extent of Bass' contribution, to which Hitchcock replied that in addition to the titles, Bass had provided storyboards for the Arbogast murder (which he claimed to have rejected), but made no mention of Bass providing storyboards for the shower scene.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://notcoming.com/saulbass/caps_psycho.php|title=Psycho: The Title Credits|accessdate=November 20, 2010}}</ref> According to Bill Krohn's ''Hitchcock At Work'', Bass' first claim to have directed the scene was in 1970, when he provided a magazine with 48 drawings used as storyboards as proof of his contribution.<ref name=\"Krohn\">{{Harvnb|Krohn|2003}}{{Page needed|date=September 2010}}</ref>\n\nKrohn's analysis of the production of ''Psycho'' in his book ''Hitchcock at Work'', while refuting Bass' claims for directing the scene, notes that these storyboards did introduce key aspects of the final scene\u2014most notably, the fact that the killer appears as a silhouette, and details such as the close-ups of the slashing knife, Leigh's desperate outstretched arm, the shower curtain being torn off its hooks, and the transition from the hole of the drainage pipe to Marion Crane's dead eyes. Krohn notes that this final transition is highly reminiscent of the iris titles that Bass created for ''[[Vertigo (film)|Vertigo]]''.<ref name=\"Krohn\"/>\n\nKrohn's research also notes that Hitchcock shot the scene with two cameras: one a [[Mitchell Camera|BNC Mitchell]], the other a handheld French ''[[Eclair (camera)|\u00c9clair]]'' camera which [[Orson Welles]] had used in ''[[Touch of Evil]]'' (1958). In order to create an ideal montage for the greatest emotional impact on the audience, Hitchcock shot a lot of footage of this scene which he trimmed down in the editing room. He even brought a [[Moviola]] on the set to gauge the footage required. The final sequence, which his editor [[George Tomasini]] worked on with Hitchcock's advice, however did not go far beyond the basic structural elements set up by Bass' storyboards.<ref name=\"Krohn\"/>\n\nAccording to [[Donald Spoto]] in ''The Dark Side of Genius'', Hitchcock's wife, [[Alma Reville]], spotted a blooper in one of the last screenings of ''Psycho'' before its official release: after Marion was supposedly dead, one could see her blink.

This, along with box office numbers, led to a reconsideration of the film by critics, and it eventually received a large amount of praise. It broke box-office records in Japan and the rest of Asia, France, Britain, South America, the United States, and Canada, and was a moderate success in Australia for a brief period.<ref name=\"leigh99102\"/> It was the most profitable black-and-white sound film ever made,{{citation needed|date=October 2014}} and Hitchcock personally realized well in excess of $15 million. He then swapped his rights to ''Psycho'' and his TV anthology for 150,000 shares of [[MCA Inc.|MCA]], making him the third largest shareholder in MCA Inc., and his own boss at Universal, in theory; however, this did not stop them from interfering with his later films.<ref>Stephen Rebello, ''Alfred Hitchcock and the Making of Psycho, Soft Skull Press, Berkeley, 1990.</ref><ref>Leigh, p. 141</ref> ''Psycho'' was, by a large margin, the most profitable film of Hitchcock's career, earning over $32 million for the studio on release, and $18 million by the end of the year. Around the time of the run's end, the film had grossed $50 million in domestic theaters.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, the film shattered attendance records at the [[London]] Plaza [[Movie theatre|Cinema]], but nearly all British critics gave it poor reviews, questioning Hitchcock's taste and judgment. Reasons cited for this were the critics' late screenings, forcing them to rush their reviews, their dislike of the gimmicky promotion, and Hitchcock's [[expatriate]] status.<ref name=\"leigh103106\">Leigh, pp. 103\u2013106</ref> Perhaps thanks to the public's response and Hitchcock's efforts at promoting it, the critics did a re-review, and the film was praised.

The film is instead ironic as it presents \"clarity and fulfillment\" of romance. The past is central to the film; the main characters \"struggle to understand and resolve destructive personal histories\" and ultimately fail.<ref name=\"brill200\u2013201\">{{Harvnb|Brill|1988|pp=200\u2013201}}</ref> Lesley Brill writes, \"The inexorable forces of past sins and mistakes crush hopes for regeneration and present happiness.\" The crushed hope is highlighted by the death of the protagonist, Marion Crane, halfway through the film.<ref>{{Harvnb|Brill|1988|p=223}}</ref> Marion is like [[Persephone]] of [[Greek mythology]], who is abducted temporarily from the world of the living. The myth does not sustain with Marion, who dies hopelessly in her room at the Bates Motel. The room is wallpapered with floral print like Persephone's flowers, but they are only \"reflected in mirrors, as images of images\u2014twice removed from reality\". In the scene of Marion's death, Brill describes the transition from the bathroom drain to Marion's lifeless eye, \"Like the eye of the amorphous sea creature at the end of Fellini's ''[[La Dolce Vita]]'', it marks the birth of death, an emblem of final hopelessness and corruption.\" <ref name=\"brill234\">{{Harvnb|Brill|1988|p=224}}</ref>\n\nMarion is deprived of \"the humble treasures of love, marriage, home and family\", which Hitchcock considers elements of human happiness. There exists among ''Psycho''{{'}}s secondary characters a lack of \"familial warmth and stability\", which demonstrates the unlikelihood of domestic fantasies. The film contains ironic jokes about domesticity, such as when Sam writes a letter to Marion, agreeing to marry her, only after the audience sees her buried in the swamp. Sam and Marion's sister Lila, in investigating Marion's disappearance, develop an \"increasingly connubial\" relationship, a development that Marion is denied.<ref name=\"brill228\">{{Harvnb|Brill|1988|p=228}}</ref> Norman also suffers a similarly perverse definition of domesticity. He has \"an infantile and divided personality\" and lives in a mansion whose past occupies the present. Norman displays stuffed birds that are \"frozen in time\" and keeps childhood toys and stuffed animals in his room. He is hostile toward suggestions to move from the past, such as with Marion's suggestion to put\nhis mother \"someplace\" and as a result kills Marion to preserve his past. Brill explains, {{\" '}}Someplace' for Norman is where his delusions of love, home, and family are declared invalid and exposed.\"<ref>{{Harvnb|Brill|1988|p=229}}</ref>\n\nLight and darkness feature prominently in ''Psycho''. The first shot after the [[intertitle]] is the sunny landscape of Phoenix before the camera enters a dark hotel room where Sam and Marion appear as bright figures. Marion is almost immediately cast in darkness; she is preceded by her shadow as she reenters the office to steal money and as she enters her bedroom. When she flees Phoenix, darkness descends on her drive. The following sunny morning is punctured by a watchful police officer with black sunglasses, and she finally arrives at the Bates Motel in near darkness.<ref name=\"brill225\">{{Harvnb|Brill|1988|p=225}}</ref> Bright lights are also \"the ironic equivalent of darkness\" in the film, blinding instead of illuminating. Examples of brightness include the opening window shades in Sam's and Marion's hotel room, vehicle headlights at night, the neon sign at the Bates Motel, \"the glaring white\" of the bathroom tiles where Marion dies, and the fruit cellar's exposed light bulb shining on the corpse of Norman's mother. Such bright lights typically characterize danger and violence in Hitchcock's films.<ref name=\"brill225\u2013256\">{{Harvnb|Brill|1988|pp=225\u2013226}}</ref>\n\n===Motifs===\nThe film often features shadows, mirrors, windows, and, less so, water. The shadows are present from the first scene where the blinds make bars on Marion and Sam as they peer out of the window. The stuffed birds' shadows loom over Marion as she eats, and Norman's mother is seen in only shadows until the  end. More subtly, [[Backlighting (lighting design)|backlighting]] turns the rakes in the hardware store into talons above Lila's head.<ref name=\"Leigh9093\">Leigh, pp. 90\u201393</ref>\n\nMirrors reflect Marion as she packs, her eyes as she checks the rear-view mirror, her face in the policeman's sunglasses, and her hands as she counts out the money in the car dealership's bathroom. A motel window serves as a mirror by reflecting Marion and Norman together. Hitchcock shoots through Marion's windshield and the telephone booth, when Arbogast phones Sam and Lila. The heavy downpour can be seen as a foreshadowing of the shower, and its cessation can be seen as a symbol of Marion making up her mind to return to Phoenix.<ref name=\"Leigh9093\"/>\n\nThere are a number of references to birds. Marion's last name is Crane and she is from Phoenix. Norman comments that Marion eats like a bird. The motel room has pictures of birds on the wall. Brigitte Peucker also suggests that Norman's hobby of stuffing birds literalizes the British slang expression for sex, \"stuffing birds\", ''bird'' being British slang for a desirable woman.<ref>{{cite book |title=The Material Image: Art And the Real in Film |last= Peucker |first=Brigitte |authorlink= |year=2007 |publisher=Stanford University Press |location= |isbn=978-0-8047-5431-6 |page=167 |url=}}</ref> Robert Allan suggests that Norman's mother is his original \"stuffed bird\", both in the sense of having preserved her body and the incestuous nature of Norman's emotional bond with her.<ref>{{cite book |title=Hitchcock's Romantic Irony |last= Allen |first=Richard |authorlink= |year=2007 |publisher=Columbia University Press |location= |isbn=978-0-231-13575-7 |page=161 |url=}}</ref>\n\n===Psychoanalytic interpretation===\n''Psycho'' has been called \"the first [[Psychoanalysis|psychoanalytical]] thriller.\"<ref name=\"Kaganski\">{{Harvnb|Kaganski|1997}}</ref> The sex and violence in the film were unlike anything previously seen in a mainstream film. \"The shower scene is both feared and desired,\" wrote French film critic Serge Kaganski. \"Hitchcock may be scaring his female viewers out of their wits, but he is turning his male viewers into potential rapists, since Janet Leigh has been turning men on ever since she appeared in her brassiere in the first scene.\"<ref name=\"Kaganski\"/>\n\nIn his documentary ''[[The Pervert's Guide to Cinema]]'', [[Slavoj \u017di\u017eek]] remarks that Norman Bates' mansion has three floors, paralleling the three levels of the human mind that are postulated by [[Freud]]ian [[psychoanalysis]]: the top floor would be the ''[[superego]]'', where Bates' mother lives; the ground floor is then Bates' ''[[Id, ego and super-ego|ego]]'', where he functions as an apparently normal human being; and finally, the basement would be Bates' ''[[Id, ego, and super-ego|id]]''. \u017di\u017eek interprets Bates' moving his mother's corpse from top floor to basement as a symbol for the deep connection that psychoanalysis posits between superego and id.<ref>{{cite video |people= [[Sophie Fiennes|Fiennes, Sophie]] (director); [[Slavoj \u017di\u017eek|\u017di\u017eek, Slavoj]] (writer/narrator) |date = 2006|url = https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0828154|title = The Pervert's Guide to Cinema|medium= documentary |publisher=Amoeba Film}}</ref>\n\n==Recognition==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin:auto; width:100%;\"\n|-\n!

The 1949 [[Karachi Agreement]] and 1972 [[Simla Agreement]] did not mention who controlled the glacier, merely stating that the Cease Fire Line (CFL) terminated at NJ9842.<ref name=\":0\" /> U.N. officials presumed there would be no dispute between India and Pakistan over such a cold and barren region.<ref>Modern world history- Chapter-The Indian subcontinent achieves independence/The Coldest War.</ref>\n\n===Paragraph B 2 (d) of Karachi Agreement===\nFollowing the UN-mediated cease-fire in 1949, the line between India and Pakistan was demarcated up to point NJ9842 at the foot of the Siachen Glacier.

Pakistan granted several permits. This, in turn, reinforced the Pakistani claim on the area, as these expeditions arrived on the glacier with a permit obtained from the [[Government of Pakistan]]. [[Teram Kangri]] I ({{convert|7465|m|ft|abbr=on|disp=or}}) and [[Teram Kangri]] II ({{convert|7406|m|ft|abbr=on|disp=or}}) were climbed in 1975 by a Japanese expedition led by H.

It established the base camp on the confluence of Siachen and Teram Shehr. The documentary \"Expedition to the longest glacier\" was shown on the 3rd channel of WDR (German TV) in 1979.\n\nBefore 1984 neither India nor Pakistan had any permanent presence in the area. Having become aware of the U.S. military maps and the permit incidents, [[Colonel Narendra Kumar]], then commanding officer of the Indian Army's [[High Altitude Warfare School]], mounted an Army expedition to the Siachen area as a counter-exercise. In 1978 this expedition climbed [[Teram Kangri]] II, claiming it as a first ascent in a typical \"oropolitical\" riposte. Unusually for the normally secretive Indian Army, the news and photographs of this expedition were published in [[The Illustrated Weekly of India]], a widely circulated popular magazine.<ref name=\"Outsideonline.com\">{{cite web |url=https://www.outsideonline.com/1912811/coldest-war|title=Outside magazine article about Siachen battleground |publisher=Outsideonline.com |accessdate=5 January 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe first public acknowledgment of the maneuvers and the developing conflict situation in the Siachen was an abbreviated article titled \"High Politics in the Karakoram\" by [[Joydeep Sircar]] in ''The Telegraph'' newspaper of [[Calcutta]] in 1982.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.telegraphindia.com/1060515/asp/nation/story_6221947.asp |title=The Telegraph \u2013 Calcutta : Nation |publisher=Telegraphindia.com |date=15 May 2006 |accessdate=15 April 2011 |location=Calcutta, India |first=Sujan |last=Dutta |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110525175651/http://www.telegraphindia.com/1060515/asp/nation/story_6221947.asp |archive-date=25 May 2011 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}</ref> The full text was re-printed as \"Oropolitics\" in the Alpine Journal, [[London]], in 1984.<ref>Alpine Journal, 1984</ref>\n\n=== Historic maps of Siachen Glacier ===\n\nMaps from Pakistan, the United Nations and various global atlases depicted the CFL ending at NJ9842 until the mid 1960s.<ref name=tribune/> The United States Defense Mapping Agency (now [[National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency]]) began in about 1967 to show a boundary on their Tactical Pilotage Charts as proceeding from NJ9842 east-northeast to the [[Karakoram Pass]] at 5,534&nbsp;m (18,136&nbsp;ft) on the China border.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://legacy.lib.utexas.edu/maps/tpc/txu-pclmaps-oclc-22834566_g-7d.jpg|date=1967|title=TPC G-7D|publisher=US Defense Mapping Agency|access-date=5 January 2019}}</ref>  This line was replicated on US, Pakistani and other maps in the 1970s and 1980s, which India believed to be a [[Cartography#Cartographic errors|cartographic error]].<ref name=\"Outsideonline.com\"/>\n\n{|style=\"margin: 0 auto;\"\n| [[File:Old Map Showing Siachen as Part of Pakistan.jpg|thumb|right|Map showing Siachen Glacier as part of Pakistan]]\n| [[File:The Trekker's Guide to the Himalaya and Karakoram 2.jpg|thumb| map showing Siachen Glacier as part of Pakistan]]\n|}\n\n==Military expeditions==\n\nIn 1977, an Indian colonel named [[Narendra Kumar (mountaineer)|Narendra Kumar]], offended by international expeditions venturing onto the glacier from the Pakistani side, persuaded his superiors to allow him to lead a 70-man team of climbers and porters to the glacier.<ref name=\":1\" /> They returned in or around 1981, climbed several peaks, and walked the length of Siachen.\n\n==Major combat operations==\n\nAt army headquarters in Rawalpindi, the discovery of repeated Indian military expeditions to the glacier drove Pakistani generals to the idea of securing Siachen before India did. This operation was called [[Operation Ababeel]]. In the haste to pull together operational resources, Pakistan planners made a tactical error, according to a now-retired Pakistani army colonel. \"They ordered Arctic-weather gear from a London outfitter who also supplied the Indians,\" says the colonel. \"Once the Indians got wind of it, they ordered 300 outfits\u2014twice as many as we had\u2014and rushed their men up to Siachen\".

Pakistan Army, in turn, learned of the presence of Ladakh Scouts on the passes during a helicopter recon mission. In response to these developments, Pakistan Army initiated an operation using troops from the Special Services Group and Northern Light Infantry to displace the three hundred or so Indian troops on the key passes.

The perceived humiliation at Siachen manifests itself in many ways. It is synonymous with Indian perfidy and a violation of the [[Shimla Agreement]]... In Pakistan, Siachen is a subject that hurts, just like a thorn in its flesh; it is also a psychological drain on the Pakistani Army. [[Pervez Musharraf]] had himself once commanded the [[Special Services Group]] (SSG) troops in this area and made several futile attempts to capture Indian posts.{{sfn|Malik|2006|p=54}}</blockquote>\n\n==Severe conditions==\nA cease-fire went into effect in 2003.  Even before then, more soldiers were killed every year due to severe weather coditions than enemy fire. The two sides by 2003 had lost an estimated 2,000 personnel primarily due to [[frostbite]], [[avalanches]] and other complications.  Together, the nations have about 150 manned outposts along the glacier, with some 3,000 troops each.  Official figures for maintaining these outposts are put at ~$300 and ~$200&nbsp;million for India and Pakistan respectively. India built the world's highest [[helipad]] on the glacier at [[Point Sonam]], 21,000 feet (6,400&nbsp;m) above the sea level, to supply its troops. The problems of reinforcing or evacuating the high-altitude ridgeline have led to India's development of the [[Advanced Light Helicopter|Dhruv]] Mk III helicopter, powered by the [[Shakti engine]], which was flight-tested to lift and land personnel and stores from the [[Sonam post]], the highest permanently manned post in the world.<ref>{{cite news|last = Shukla|first = Ajai|url = http://www.business-standard.com/india/news/in-siachen-dhruv-provesworld-beater/427533/|title = In Siachen, Dhruv proves a world-beater|date = 20 January 2013|origyear = First published 7 March 2011|journal = Business Standard|place = New Delhi|access-date = 7 March 2011|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110806070753/http://www.business-standard.com/india/news/in-siachen-dhruv-provesworld-beater/427533/|archive-date = 6 August 2011|url-status = live|df = dmy-all}}</ref> India also installed the world's highest [[telephone booth]] on the glacier.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-67743542.html |accessdate=11 September 2008 |url-status=dead |origyear= Published 9 November 1997|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714222017/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-67743542.html|journal = Denver Rocky Mountain News|archivedate=14 July 2014|title = India Installs World's Highest Phone Booth Soldiers Fighting Along Kashmir Glacier Can Now Call Families, Army Says}}</ref>\n\nAccording to some estimates, 97% of the casualties in Siachen have been due to weather and altitude, rather than actual fighting.<ref name=\"Jack\">{{cite book\n  |last = Ives\n  |first = Jack\n  |title = Himalayan Perceptions: Environmental Change and the Well-Being of Mountain Peoples\n  |publisher = Routledge, 2004\n  |isbn = 9781134369089|date = 5 August 2004\n }}</ref> In 2012, an avalanche [[2012 Siachen Glacier avalanche|hit Pakistan's Gayari military base, killing 129 soldiers and 11 civilians]].<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-18246239| publisher=Bbc.co.uk| title=Pakistan declares Siachen avalanche buried dead| date=29 May 2012| access-date=21 June 2018| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160118155050/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-18246239| archive-date=18 January 2016| url-status=live| df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/Pakistan/Siachen-Pakistan-declares-buried-troops-dead-after-52-days/Article1-862824.aspx|title=Siachen: Pakistan declares buried troops dead after 52 days \u2013 Hindustan Times|publisher=Hindustantimes.com|accessdate=7 October 2014|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141011175924/http://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/Pakistan/Siachen-Pakistan-declares-buried-troops-dead-after-52-days/Article1-862824.aspx|archivedate=11 October 2014|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n==Kargil War==\nOne of the factors behind the [[Kargil War]] in 1999 when Pakistan sent infiltrators to occupy vacated Indian posts across the [[Line of Control]] was their belief that India would be forced to withdraw from Siachen in exchange of a Pakistani withdrawal from Kargil.<ref name=\"India, Pakistan, and the Bomb: Debating Nuclear Stability in South Asia\">{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5vZKO2XtiFMC |title=India, Pakistan, and the Bomb: Debating Nuclear Stability in South Asia |last=Ganguly |first=Sumit |last2=Kapur |first2=S.

The 1949 [[Karachi Agreement]] and 1972 [[Simla Agreement]] did not clearly mention who controlled the glacier, merely stating that the Cease Fire Line (CFL) terminated at NJ9842.<ref name=\":0\" /> UN officials presumed there would be no dispute between India and Pakistan over such a cold and barren region.<ref>Modern world history- Chapter-The Indian subcontinent achieves independence/The Coldest War.</ref>\n\n===Paragraph B 2 (d) of Karachi Agreement===\nFollowing the UN-mediated ceasefire in 1949, the line between India and Pakistan was demarcated up to point NJ9842 at the foot of the Siachen Glacier.

Pakistan granted a number of permits. This, in turn, reinforced the Pakistani claim on the area, as these expeditions arrived on the glacier with a permit obtained from the [[Government of Pakistan]]. [[Teram Kangri]] I ({{convert|7465|m|ft|abbr=on|disp=or}}) and [[Teram Kangri]] II ({{convert|7406|m|ft|abbr=on|disp=or}}) were climbed in 1975 by a Japanese expedition led by H.

The documentary \"Expedition to the longest glacier\" was shown on the 3rd channel of WDR (German TV) in 1979.\n\nPrior to 1984 neither India nor Pakistan had any permanent presence in the area. Having become aware of the US military maps and the permit incidents, [[Colonel Narendra Kumar]], then commanding officer of the Indian Army's [[High Altitude Warfare School]], mounted an Army expedition to the Siachen area as a counter-exercise. In 1978 this expedition climbed [[Teram Kangri]] II, claiming it as a first ascent in a typical \"oropolitical\" riposte. Unusually for the normally secretive Indian Army, the news and photographs of this expedition were published in [[The Illustrated Weekly of India]], a widely circulated popular magazine.<ref name=\"Outsideonline.com\">{{cite web |url=https://www.outsideonline.com/1912811/coldest-war|title=Outside magazine article about Siachen battleground |publisher=Outsideonline.com |accessdate=5 January 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe first public acknowledgment of the maneuvers and the developing conflict situation in the Siachen was an abbreviated article titled \"High Politics in the Karakoram\" by [[Joydeep Sircar]] in ''The Telegraph'' newspaper of [[Calcutta]] in 1982.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.telegraphindia.com/1060515/asp/nation/story_6221947.asp |title=The Telegraph \u2013 Calcutta : Nation |publisher=Telegraphindia.com |date=15 May 2006 |accessdate=15 April 2011 |location=Calcutta, India |first=Sujan |last=Dutta |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110525175651/http://www.telegraphindia.com/1060515/asp/nation/story_6221947.asp |archive-date=25 May 2011 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}</ref> The full text was re-printed as \"Oropolitics\" in the Alpine Journal, [[London]], in 1984.<ref>Alpine Journal, 1984</ref>\n\n=== Historic maps of Siachen Glacier ===\n\nMaps from Pakistan, the United Nations and various global atlases depicted the CFL ending at NJ9842 until the mid 1960s.<ref name=tribune/> The United States Defense Mapping Agency (now [[National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency]]) began in about 1967 to show a boundary on their Tactical Pilotage Charts as proceeding from NJ9842 east-northeast to the [[Karakoram Pass]] at 5,534&nbsp;m (18,136&nbsp;ft) on the China border.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://legacy.lib.utexas.edu/maps/tpc/txu-pclmaps-oclc-22834566_g-7d.jpg|date=1967|title=TPC G-7D|publisher=US Defense Mapping Agency|access-date=5 January 2019}}</ref>  This line was replicated on US, Pakistani and other maps in the 1970s and 1980s, which India believed to be a [[Cartography#Cartographic errors|cartographic error]].<ref name=\"Outsideonline.com\"/>\n\n{|style=\"margin: 0 auto;\"\n| [[File:Old Map Showing Siachen as Part of Pakistan.jpg|thumb|right|Map showing Siachen Glacier as part of Pakistan]]\n| [[File:The Trekker's Guide to the Himalaya and Karakoram 2.jpg|thumb|Map showing Siachen Glacier as part of Pakistan]]\n|}\n\n==Military expeditions==\n\nIn 1977, an Indian colonel named [[Narendra Kumar (mountaineer)|Narendra Kumar]], offended by international expeditions venturing onto the glacier from the Pakistani side, persuaded his superiors to allow him to lead a 70-man team of climbers and porters to the glacier.<ref name=\":1\" /> They returned in or around 1981, climbed several peaks and walked the length of Siachen.\n\n==Major combat operations==\n\nAt army headquarters in Rawalpindi, the discovery of repeated Indian military expeditions to the glacier drove Pakistani generals to the idea of securing Siachen before India did. This operation was called [[Operation Ababeel]]. In the haste to pull together operational resources, Pakistan planners made a tactical error, according to a now-retired Pakistani army colonel. \"They ordered Arctic-weather gear from a London outfitter who also supplied the Indians,\" says the colonel. \"Once the Indians got wind of it, they ordered 300 outfits\u2014twice as many as we had\u2014and rushed their men up to Siachen\".

Pakistan Army, in turn, learned of the presence of Ladakh Scouts on the passes during a helicopter recon mission. In response to these developments, Pakistan Army initiated an operation using troops from the Special Services Group and Northern Light Infantry to displace the three hundred or so Indian troops on the key passes.

The perceived humiliation at Siachen manifests itself in many ways. It is synonymous with Indian perfidy and a violation of the [[Shimla Agreement]]... In Pakistan, Siachen is a subject that hurts, just like a thorn in its flesh; it is also a psychological drain on the Pakistani Army. [[Pervez Musharraf]] had himself once commanded the [[Special Services Group]] (SSG) troops in this area and made several futile attempts to capture Indian posts.{{sfn|Malik|2006|p=54}}</blockquote>\n\n==Severe conditions==\nA cease-fire went into effect in 2003.  Even before then, more soldiers were killed every year due to severe weather coditions than enemy fire. The two sides by 2003 had lost an estimated 2,000 personnel primarily due to [[frostbite]], [[avalanches]] and other complications.  Together, the nations have about 150 manned outposts along the glacier, with some 3,000 troops each.  Official figures for maintaining these outposts are put at ~$300 and ~$200&nbsp;million for India and Pakistan respectively. India built the world's highest [[helipad]] on the glacier at [[Point Sonam]], 21,000 feet (6,400&nbsp;m) above the sea level, to supply its troops. The problems of reinforcing or evacuating the high-altitude ridgeline have led to India's development of the [[Advanced Light Helicopter|Dhruv]] Mk III helicopter, powered by the [[Shakti engine]], which was flight-tested to lift and land personnel and stores from the [[Sonam post]], the highest permanently manned post in the world.<ref>{{cite news|last = Shukla|first = Ajai|url = http://www.business-standard.com/india/news/in-siachen-dhruv-provesworld-beater/427533/|title = In Siachen, Dhruv proves a world-beater|date = 20 January 2013|origyear = First published 7 March 2011|journal = Business Standard|place = New Delhi|access-date = 7 March 2011|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110806070753/http://www.business-standard.com/india/news/in-siachen-dhruv-provesworld-beater/427533/|archive-date = 6 August 2011|url-status = live|df = dmy-all}}</ref> India also installed the world's highest [[telephone booth]] on the glacier.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-67743542.html |accessdate=11 September 2008 |url-status=dead |origyear= Published 9 November 1997|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714222017/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-67743542.html|journal = Denver Rocky Mountain News|archivedate=14 July 2014|title = India Installs World's Highest Phone Booth Soldiers Fighting Along Kashmir Glacier Can Now Call Families, Army Says}}</ref>\n\nAccording to some estimates, 97% of the casualties in Siachen have been due to weather and altitude, rather than actual fighting.<ref name=\"Jack\">{{cite book\n  |last = Ives\n  |first = Jack\n  |title = Himalayan Perceptions: Environmental Change and the Well-Being of Mountain Peoples\n  |publisher = Routledge, 2004\n  |isbn = 9781134369089|date = 5 August 2004\n }}</ref> In 2012, an avalanche [[2012 Siachen Glacier avalanche|hit Pakistan's Gayari military base, killing 129 soldiers and 11 civilians]].<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-18246239| publisher=Bbc.co.uk| title=Pakistan declares Siachen avalanche buried dead| date=29 May 2012| access-date=21 June 2018| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160118155050/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-18246239| archive-date=18 January 2016| url-status=live| df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/Pakistan/Siachen-Pakistan-declares-buried-troops-dead-after-52-days/Article1-862824.aspx|title=Siachen: Pakistan declares buried troops dead after 52 days \u2013 Hindustan Times|publisher=Hindustantimes.com|accessdate=7 October 2014|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141011175924/http://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/Pakistan/Siachen-Pakistan-declares-buried-troops-dead-after-52-days/Article1-862824.aspx|archivedate=11 October 2014|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n==Kargil War==\nOne of the factors behind the [[Kargil War]] in 1999 when Pakistan sent infiltrators to occupy vacated Indian posts across the [[Line of Control]] was their belief that India would be forced to withdraw from Siachen in exchange of a Pakistani withdrawal from Kargil.<ref name=\"India, Pakistan, and the Bomb: Debating Nuclear Stability in South Asia\">{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5vZKO2XtiFMC |title=India, Pakistan, and the Bomb: Debating Nuclear Stability in South Asia |last=Ganguly |first=Sumit |last2=Kapur |first2=S.

It is common in [[woodworking]], [[metalworking]], and other similar trade and hobby tasks.  Most are [[hand tool]]s, made of a [[case hardened]] [[steel]] bar of rectangular, square, triangular, or round cross-section, with one or more surfaces cut with sharp, generally parallel teeth. A narrow, pointed [[Tang (tools)|tang]] is common at one end, to which a handle may be fitted.<ref name=\"lye 12\" >{{harvnb|Lye|1993|pp=12\u201313}}.</ref>\n\nA [[rasp]] is a form of file with distinct, individually cut teeth used for coarsely removing large amounts of material.<ref name=facts>[https://web.archive.org/web/20170713023750/http://www.simondsint.com/handfiles/HAND%20FILES%20PUBLICATIONS/File%20Facts.pdf Facts about Files]</ref>\n\nFiles have also been developed with abrasive surfaces, such as natural or synthetic [[diamond tool|diamond grains]] or [[silicon carbide]], allowing removal of material that would dull or resist metal, such as [[ceramic]].\n\n== History ==\nEarly filing or [[rasp]]ing has prehistoric roots and grew naturally out of the blending of the twin inspirations of cutting with stone cutting tools (such as [[hand axe]]s) and [[abrasive|abrading]] using natural abrasives, such as well-suited types of stone (for example, [[sandstone]]).<ref name=\"DisstonInc1920pp5-15\">{{Harvnb|Henry Disston & Sons, Inc|1920}}, [https://books.google.com/?id=DlZAAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA5 pp. 5\u201315].</ref> Relatedly, [[lapping]] is also quite ancient, with [[wood]] and beach [[sand]] offering a natural pair of lap and lapping compound. The Disston authors state, \"To abrade, or file, ancient man used sand, grit, coral, bone, fish skin, and gritty woods,\u2014also stone of varying hardness in connection with sand and water.\"<ref name=\"DisstonInc1920p5\">{{Harvnb|Henry Disston & Sons, Inc|1920}}, [https://books.google.com/?id=DlZAAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA5 p. 5].</ref>\n\nThe [[Bronze Age]] and the [[Iron Age]] had various kinds of files and rasps. Archaeologists have discovered rasps made from bronze in Egypt, dating back to the years 1200\u20131000 BC. Archaeologists have also discovered rasps made of iron used by the Assyrians, dating back to the 7th Century BC.\n\nDuring the [[Middle Ages]] files were already quite advanced, thanks to the extensive talents of [[blacksmith]]s.<ref name=\"DisstonInc1920pp16-17\">{{Harvnb|Henry Disston & Sons, Inc|1920}}, [https://books.google.com/?id=DlZAAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA16 pp. 16\u201317].</ref> By the 11th century, there already existed [[hardening (metallurgy)|hardened]] files that would seem quite modern even to today's eyes.<ref name=\"DisstonInc1920pp16-17\"/> But although they existed, and could even have spread widely, in a geographical sense, via [[trade]], they were not widespread in the cultural sense of the word\u2014that is, most people, and even many [[metalsmith|smiths]], did not have them. For example, in the 13th century, ornamental iron work at [[Paris]] was done skillfully with the aid of files, but [[trade secret|the process was a secret]] known only to a master craftsman.<ref name=\"DisstonInc1920pp16-17\"/> The Disston authors state, \"It was not until the fourteenth century, however, that those who practiced art in ironwork began to use other tools, besides heat and the hammer, regularly.\"<ref name=\"DisstonInc1920pp16-17\"/> This statement could mislead in the sense that stoning (with sandstone) and lapping (with wood, sand, and water) have never been rare activities among humans, or especially smiths. But the point is that modern iron or steel files, with teeth and hardening, and the [[material culture]] of intricate filing that would lead to [[locksmithing]] and [[gunsmith]]ing, for example, are what took time to become common. But by the [[late Middle Ages]], the transition was extensive. The Disston authors mention [[Nuremberg]], [[Sheffield]], and [[Remscheid]] (they use the ''Reimscheid'' spelling) as leading centers of production for files as well as tools in general. The activity in Remscheid reflects the metalworking spirit of the [[Rhine-Ruhr]] region in general (including [[Essen]], [[D\u00fcsseldorf]], and [[Cologne]]) rather than representing a single village of geniuses in isolation. (Considering the Disston authors' mention of the blacksmith guilds of 13th-century [[Florence]] and 15th-century England, coupled with their mention of [[Nuremberg]], [[Sheffield]], and [[Remscheid]], the region that sweeps from Florence through Nuremberg, the Rhine-Ruhr, the Netherlands, and up to Sheffield, can be compared to the modern economics notation of the [[Blue Banana]].) Most files of the period were smithed by hand in a sequence in which the iron was [[forging|forged]] (heated and hammered), then the teeth were cut with a [[chisel]] (some of this action was just as much [[upsetting]]/[[swaging]] as it was cutting), and then the piece was [[hardening (metallurgy)|hardened]] (by heating and then [[quenching]]), followed sometimes by [[tempering (metallurgy)|tempering]]. Among the drawings of [[Leonardo da Vinci]] is a sketch of a [[machine tool]] for the cutting of files (the chisel would make one strike, [[swaging]] a tooth, then automatically advance into position for the next tooth, and strike again).\n\nPrior to the industrialization of [[machining]] and the development of [[interchangeable parts]] during the 19th century, filing was much more important in the construction of [[mechanism (engineering)|mechanism]]s. Component parts were roughly shaped by [[forging]], [[casting]], and by primitive [[machining]] operations. These components were then individually hand-fitted for assembly by careful and deliberate filing. The potential precision of such [[engineering fit|fitting]] is much higher than generally assumed, but the components of such hand-fit assemblies are decidedly not interchangeable with those from another assembly. [[Lock (security device)|Lock]]s, [[clock]]s, and [[firearm]]s (flintlocks and earlier) were manufactured in this way for centuries before the [[Industrial Revolution]].\n\n[[Machining]] in the mid-19th century was heavily dependent on filing, because [[Milling machine|milling]] practice was slowly evolving out of its infancy. As late as the early 20th century, [[manufacturing]] often involved filing parts to precise shape and size. In today's manufacturing environment, milling and grinding have generally replaced this type of work, and filing (when it occurs at all) usually tends to be for [[Burr (metal)|deburring]] only.

They are used by luthiers to file a rounded \"crown\" on the frets of guitars and other fretted instruments.

Shaped like a toothed cylinder.\n* '''Saw sharpening files''' are usually single cut to deliver a smooth finish. They are suited to sharpening saw blades and dressing tool edges, especially where a finer, sharper edge or smoother surface finish is desired.  The '''Chainsaw file''' is one example, used primarily for sharpening chainsaws.

Used for flat work and slotting.\n\n=== Diamond files ===\n[[File:DiamondFiles.jpg|thumb|200px|A selection of diamond impregnated files]]\n\nInstead of having teeth cut into the file's working surface, diamond files have small particles of [[Diamond#Industrial-grade_diamonds|industrial diamond]] embedded in their surface (or into a softer material that is bonded to the underlying surface of the file). The use of diamonds in this manner allows the file to be used effectively against extremely hard materials, such as stone, glass or very hard metals such as hardened steel or carbide against which a standard steel file is ineffective. Diamond files are also the only type that may be used with a back-and-forth motion without damaging the file. These may also be called diamond [[lap (tool)|lap]]s, as the \"teeth\" are not regular projections, as in a file, but particles, usually shaped and located randomly and held in place by a softer (any other) material.\n{{Clear}}\n\n=== Needle files ===\n[[File:Glardon Vallorbe LA2442-0 140 mm Swiss cut 0 6-piece needle file set.png|thumb|250px|left|A needle file set depicting various shapes, from top to bottom: pillar, half round, barrette, square, round, triangular.]]\n\nThe image to the left shows a selection of needle files in an assortment of cross sectional shapes.\n\nNeedle files are small files that are used in applications where the surface finish takes priority over metal removal rates but they are most suited for smaller work pieces. They are often sold in sets, including different shapes.\n{{Clear}}\n\n=== Riffler files ===\n[[File:RifflerFiles.jpg|thumb|200px|A selection of riffler files]]\n\nRiffler files are small to medium-sized files in an assortment of cross sectional shapes and profiles. The varying profiles and shapes enable them to be used in hard to reach, or unusually shaped areas. They are often used as an intermediate step in die making where the surface finish of a cavity die may need to be improved, e.g. in [[Injection moulding|plastic injection moulding]] or [[Die casting#Die Casting|die casting]].\n{{Clear}}\n\n=== Machine files ===\n[[File:MachineFiles.jpg|thumb|200px|left|A selection of machine files]]\n\nFiles are produced specifically for use in a ''filing machine'', which is similar in appearance to a [[scroll saw]] with a vertically reciprocating file mounted in the middle of a table. A workpiece is manipulated around the file's face as the shape requires.\n\nA cone point (as pictured in the top and bottom files at left) allows a file to center itself in its mount. Files with flat mounting surfaces must be secured with [[set screw]]s.\n\nFiling machines are rarely seen in modern production environments, but may be found in older toolrooms or diemaking shops as an aid in the manufacture of specialist tooling.\n{{Clear}}\n\n=== Escapement files ===\n\nEscapement files, also known as watchmaker's files, are a classification of short, (very) thin files with bastard-cut or embedded diamond surfaces, similar to needle files in form and function but smaller. Typical dimensions are on the order of approximately 100\u2013140&nbsp;mm (4\u20135{{frac|1|2}} in.) in length and 3\u20135&nbsp;mm ({{frac|1|8}}\u2013{{frac|3|16}} in.) in width. Best used for fine, delicate work on small pieces or mechanisms (such as [[escapement]]s), escapement files are commonly used by clock and [[watchmakers]], as well as in crafting jewelry.\n\n=== Dental files ===\n\nDuring [[root canal therapy]], round files ranging from {{convert|.06|to|0.8|mm|adj=on}} diameter files are used to smooth the narrow canals of the interior of the tooth and thus facilitate disinfection of the internal surface. Typically the files are made of [[stainless steel]] or [[nickel titanium]] (NiTi) and come in a variety of styles. Mechanized files, known as rotary files, are also commonly used. These files attach to the head of a specific oscillating or rotating drill.<ref>Walton, Richard E. Principles and Practice of Endodontics, 3rd Edition. Saunders Book Company, 012002. Page 212.</ref>\n\n== Use {{Anchor|File card}} ==\n{{Main|Filing (metalworking)}}\n\nFiles have forward-facing cutting teeth, and cut most effectively when pushed over the workpiece. A variety of strokes are employed to stabilize the cutting action and derive a varied result.<ref name=facts/> Pulling a file directly backwards on a workpiece will cause the teeth to dull. ''Draw filing'' is an operation in which the file is grasped\nat each end, and with an even pressure alternately pulled and pushed perpendicularly over the work.<ref name=facts/> A variation involves laying the file sideways on the work, and carefully pushing or pulling it across the work. This catches the teeth of the file sideways instead of head on, and a very fine shaving action is produced.  There are also varying strokes that produce a combination of the straight ahead stroke and the drawfiling stroke, and very fine work can be attained in this fashion.  Using a combination of strokes, and progressively finer files, a skilled operator can attain a surface that is perfectly flat and near mirror finish.\n\n''Pinning'' refers to the clogging of the file teeth with ''pins'', which are material shavings.{{cn|date=June 2016}} These pins cause the file to lose its cutting ability and can scratch the workpiece. A ''file card'', which is a brush with metal bristles, is used to clean the file. (The name, \"card\", is the same as used for the \"[[raising card]]s\" (spiked brushes) used in woolmaking.){{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} [[Chalk]] can help prevent pinning.<ref>{{harvnb|Lye|1993|p=13}}.</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n*[[Hand scraper]]\n*[[Rasp]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n=== Bibliography ===\n{{Commons category|Files and rasps}}\n*{{Citation | author = Henry Disston & Sons, Inc | authorlink = Disston Saw Works | year = 1920 | title = The File: Its History, Making, and Uses | publisher = Henry Disston & Sons, Inc | location = Philadelphia, PA, USA | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=DlZAAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA1#v=onepage&q&f=false | postscript =.}}\n*{{Citation | last = Lye | first = P.

It is common in [[woodworking]], [[metalworking]], and other similar trade and hobby tasks.  Most are [[hand tool]]s, made of a [[case hardened]] [[steel]] bar of rectangular, square, triangular, or round cross-section, with one or more surfaces cut with sharp, generally parallel teeth. A narrow, pointed [[Tang (tools)|tang]] is common at one end, to which a handle may be fitted.<ref name=\"lye 12\" >{{harvnb|Lye|1993|pp=12\u201313}}.</ref>\n\nA [[rasp]] is a form of file with distinct, individually cut teeth used for coarsely removing large amounts of material.<ref name=facts>[https://web.archive.org/web/20170713023750/http://www.simondsint.com/handfiles/HAND%20FILES%20PUBLICATIONS/File%20Facts.pdf Facts about Files]</ref>\n\nFiles have also been developed with abrasive surfaces, such as natural or synthetic [[diamond tool|diamond grains]] or [[silicon carbide]], allowing removal of material that would dull or resist metal, such as [[ceramic]].\n\n== History ==\nEarly filing or [[rasp]]ing has prehistoric roots and grew naturally out of the blending of the twin inspirations of cutting with stone cutting tools (such as [[hand axe]]s) and [[abrasive|abrading]] using natural abrasives, such as well-suited types of stone (for example, [[sandstone]]).<ref name=\"DisstonInc1920pp5-15\">{{Harvnb|Henry Disston & Sons, Inc|1920}}, [https://books.google.com/?id=DlZAAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA5 pp. 5\u201315].</ref> Relatedly, [[lapping]] is also quite ancient, with [[wood]] and beach [[sand]] offering a natural pair of lap and lapping compound. The Disston authors state, \"To abrade, or file, ancient man used sand, grit, coral, bone, fish skin, and gritty woods,\u2014also stone of varying hardness in connection with sand and water.\"<ref name=\"DisstonInc1920p5\">{{Harvnb|Henry Disston & Sons, Inc|1920}}, [https://books.google.com/?id=DlZAAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA5 p. 5].</ref>\n\nThe [[Bronze Age]] and the [[Iron Age]] had various kinds of files and rasps. Archaeologists have discovered rasps made from bronze in Egypt, dating back to the years 1200\u20131000 BC. Archaeologists have also discovered rasps made of iron used by the Assyrians, dating back to the 7th Century BC.\n\nDuring the [[Middle Ages]] files were already quite advanced, thanks to the extensive talents of [[blacksmith]]s.<ref name=\"DisstonInc1920pp16-17\">{{Harvnb|Henry Disston & Sons, Inc|1920}}, [https://books.google.com/?id=DlZAAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA16 pp. 16\u201317].</ref> By the 11th century, there already existed [[hardening (metallurgy)|hardened]] files that would seem quite modern even to today's eyes.<ref name=\"DisstonInc1920pp16-17\"/> But although they existed, and could even have spread widely, in a geographical sense, via [[trade]], they were not widespread in the cultural sense of the word\u2014that is, most people, and even many [[metalsmith|smiths]], did not have them. For example, in the 13th century, ornamental iron work at [[Paris]] was done skillfully with the aid of files, but [[trade secret|the process was a secret]] known only to a master craftsman.<ref name=\"DisstonInc1920pp16-17\"/> The Disston authors state, \"It was not until the fourteenth century, however, that those who practiced art in ironwork began to use other tools, besides heat and the hammer, regularly.\"<ref name=\"DisstonInc1920pp16-17\"/> This statement could mislead in the sense that stoning (with sandstone) and lapping (with wood, sand, and water) have never been rare activities among humans, or especially smiths. But the point is that modern iron or steel files, with teeth and hardening, and the [[material culture]] of intricate filing that would lead to [[locksmithing]] and [[gunsmith]]ing, for example, are what took time to become common. But by the [[late Middle Ages]], the transition was extensive. The Disston authors mention [[Nuremberg]], [[Sheffield]], and [[Remscheid]] (they use the ''Reimscheid'' spelling) as leading centers of production for files as well as tools in general. The activity in Remscheid reflects the metalworking spirit of the [[Rhine-Ruhr]] region in general (including [[Essen]], [[D\u00fcsseldorf]], and [[Cologne]]) rather than representing a single village of geniuses in isolation. (Considering the Disston authors' mention of the blacksmith guilds of 13th-century [[Florence]] and 15th-century England, coupled with their mention of [[Nuremberg]], [[Sheffield]], and [[Remscheid]], the region that sweeps from Florence through Nuremberg, the Rhine-Ruhr, the Netherlands, and up to Sheffield, can be compared to the modern economics notation of the [[Blue Banana]].) Most files of the period were smithed by hand in a sequence in which the iron was [[forging|forged]] (heated and hammered), then the teeth were cut with a [[chisel]] (some of this action was just as much [[upsetting]]/[[swaging]] as it was cutting), and then the piece was [[hardening (metallurgy)|hardened]] (by heating and then [[quenching]]), followed sometimes by [[tempering (metallurgy)|tempering]]. Among the drawings of [[Leonardo da Vinci]] is a sketch of a [[machine tool]] for the cutting of files (the chisel would make one strike, [[swaging]] a tooth, then automatically advance into position for the next tooth, and strike again).\n\nPrior to the industrialization of [[machining]] and the development of [[interchangeable parts]] during the 19th century, filing was much more important in the construction of [[mechanism (engineering)|mechanism]]s. Component parts were roughly shaped by [[forging]], [[casting]], and by primitive [[machining]] operations. These components were then individually hand-fitted for assembly by careful and deliberate filing. The potential precision of such [[engineering fit|fitting]] is much higher than generally assumed, but the components of such hand-fit assemblies are decidedly not interchangeable with those from another assembly. [[Lock (security device)|Lock]]s, [[clock]]s, and [[firearm]]s (flintlocks and earlier) were manufactured in this way for centuries before the [[Industrial Revolution]].\n\n[[Machining]] in the mid-19th century was heavily dependent on filing, because [[Milling machine|milling]] practice was slowly evolving out of its infancy. As late as the early 20th century, [[manufacturing]] often involved filing parts to precise shape and size. In today's manufacturing environment, milling and grinding have generally replaced this type of work, and filing (when it occurs at all) usually tends to be for [[Burr (metal)|deburring]] only. Skillful filing to shape and size is still a part of [[Tool and die maker|diemaking, moldmaking, toolmaking, etc.]], but even in those fields, the goal is usually to avoid handwork when possible.\n\n== Types ==\n[[File:FilesFlat-Smooth-2ndCut-Bastard.jpg|thumb|Relative tooth sizes for smooth, 2nd cut and bastard files]]\n\nFiles come in a wide variety of materials, sizes, shapes, cuts, and tooth configurations.

Used for filing the junction of two curved surfaces and making V-shaped slots.\n*'''Planemaker's float''' [[Float (woodworking)|Floats]] are straight, single-cut files which taper used for cutting, flattening and smoothing wood, particularly in making wooden hand planes.\n* '''Round parallel files''' are similar to round files, except that they do not taper.  Shaped like a toothed cylinder.\n* '''Saw sharpening files''' are usually single cut to deliver a smooth finish. They are suited to sharpening saw blades and dressing tool edges, especially where a finer, sharper edge or smoother surface finish is desired.  The '''Chainsaw file''' is one example, used primarily for sharpening chainsaws. These appear to have a round cross-section, but are actually shaped to fit snugly against the cutting edge of a chainsaw's teeth.\n* '''Slitting files''' are parallel in width with a diamond-shaped cross section.  Thinner than knife files and use for filing slots.\n* '''Warding files''' are parallel in thickness, tapered in width, and thin.  Like a hand or flat file that comes to a point on the end. Used for flat work and slotting.\n\n=== Diamond files ===\n[[File:DiamondFiles.jpg|thumb|200px|A selection of diamond impregnated files]]\n\nInstead of having teeth cut into the file's working surface, diamond files have small particles of [[Diamond#Industrial-grade_diamonds|industrial diamond]] embedded in their surface (or into a softer material that is bonded to the underlying surface of the file). The use of diamonds in this manner allows the file to be used effectively against extremely hard materials, such as stone, glass or very hard metals such as hardened steel or carbide against which a standard steel file is ineffective. Diamond files are also the only type that may be used with a back-and-forth motion without damaging the file. These may also be called diamond [[lap (tool)|lap]]s, as the \"teeth\" are not regular projections, as in a file, but particles, usually shaped and located randomly and held in place by a softer (any other) material.\n{{Clear}}\n\n=== Needle files ===\n[[File:Glardon Vallorbe LA2442-0 140 mm Swiss cut 0 6-piece needle file set.png|thumb|250px|left|A needle file set depicting various shapes, from top to bottom: pillar, half round, barrette, square, round, triangular.]]\n\nThe image to the left shows a selection of needle files in an assortment of cross sectional shapes.\n\nNeedle files are small files that are used in applications where the surface finish takes priority over metal removal rates but they are most suited for smaller work pieces. They are often sold in sets, including different shapes.\n{{Clear}}\n\n=== Riffler files ===\n[[File:RifflerFiles.jpg|thumb|200px|A selection of riffler files]]\n\nRiffler files are small to medium-sized files in an assortment of cross sectional shapes and profiles. The varying profiles and shapes enable them to be used in hard to reach, or unusually shaped areas. They are often used as an intermediate step in die making where the surface finish of a cavity die may need to be improved, e.g. in [[Injection moulding|plastic injection moulding]] or [[Die casting#Die Casting|die casting]].\n{{Clear}}\n\n=== Machine files ===\n[[File:MachineFiles.jpg|thumb|200px|left|A selection of machine files]]\n\nFiles are produced specifically for use in a ''filing machine'', which is similar in appearance to a [[scroll saw]] with a vertically reciprocating file mounted in the middle of a table. A workpiece is manipulated around the file's face as the shape requires.\n\nA cone point (as pictured in the top and bottom files at left) allows a file to center itself in its mount. Files with flat mounting surfaces must be secured with [[set screw]]s.\n\nFiling machines are rarely seen in modern production environments, but may be found in older toolrooms or diemaking shops as an aid in the manufacture of specialist tooling.\n{{Clear}}\n\n=== Escapement files ===\n\nEscapement files, also known as watchmaker's files, are a classification of short, (very) thin files with bastard-cut or embedded diamond surfaces, similar to needle files in form and function but smaller. Typical dimensions are on the order of approximately 100\u2013140&nbsp;mm (4\u20135{{frac|1|2}} in.) in length and 3\u20135&nbsp;mm ({{frac|1|8}}\u2013{{frac|3|16}} in.) in width. Best used for fine, delicate work on small pieces or mechanisms (such as [[escapement]]s), escapement files are commonly used by clock and [[watchmakers]], as well as in crafting jewelry.\n\n=== Dental files ===\n\nDuring [[root canal therapy]], round files ranging from {{convert|.06|to|0.8|mm|adj=on}} diameter files are used to smooth the narrow canals of the interior of the tooth and thus facilitate disinfection of the internal surface. Typically the files are made of [[stainless steel]] or [[nickel titanium]] (NiTi) and come in a variety of styles. Mechanized files, known as rotary files, are also commonly used. These files attach to the head of a specific oscillating or rotating drill.<ref>Walton, Richard E. Principles and Practice of Endodontics, 3rd Edition. Saunders Book Company, 012002.

A variety of strokes are employed to stabilize the cutting action and derive a varied result.<ref name=facts/> Pulling a file directly backwards on a workpiece will cause the teeth to dull. ''Draw filing'' is an operation in which the file is grasped\nat each end, and with an even pressure alternately pulled and pushed perpendicularly over the work.<ref name=facts/> A variation involves laying the file sideways on the work, and carefully pushing or pulling it across the work. This catches the teeth of the file sideways instead of head on, and a very fine shaving action is produced.  There are also varying strokes that produce a combination of the straight ahead stroke and the drawfiling stroke, and very fine work can be attained in this fashion.  Using a combination of strokes, and progressively finer files, a skilled operator can attain a surface that is perfectly flat and near mirror finish.\n\n''Pinning'' refers to the clogging of the file teeth with ''pins'', which are material shavings.{{cn|date=June 2016}} These pins cause the file to lose its cutting ability and can scratch the workpiece. A ''file card'', which is a brush with metal bristles, is used to clean the file. (The name, \"card\", is the same as used for the \"[[raising card]]s\" (spiked brushes) used in woolmaking.){{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} [[Chalk]] can help prevent pinning.<ref>{{harvnb|Lye|1993|p=13}}.</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n*[[Hand scraper]]\n*[[Rasp]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n=== Bibliography ===\n{{Commons category|Files and rasps}}\n*{{Citation | author = Henry Disston & Sons, Inc | authorlink = Disston Saw Works | year = 1920 | title = The File: Its History, Making, and Uses | publisher = Henry Disston & Sons, Inc | location = Philadelphia, PA, USA | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=DlZAAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA1#v=onepage&q&f=false | postscript =.}}\n*{{Citation | last = Lye | first = P.
