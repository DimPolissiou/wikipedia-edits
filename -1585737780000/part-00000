The song was released on 13 December 1977 as the second single from the ''Saturday Night Fever'' soundtrack. The band co-produced the song with [[Albhy Galuten]] and Karl Richardson. It is one of the Bee Gees' [[signature song]]s. In 2004, \"Stayin' Alive\" was placed at number 189 on the list of [[Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Songs of All Time]].<ref name=\"RS\"/> In 2004, it ranked No. 9 on [[AFI's 100 Years...100 Songs]] survey of top tunes in American cinema. In a UK television poll on [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] in December 2011 it was voted fifth in \"''[[The Nation's Favourite|The Nation's Favourite Bee Gees Song]]''\".<ref>\"The Nation's Favourite Bee Gees Song\". [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]]. 9 December 2011.</ref>\n\nOn its release, \"Stayin' Alive\" climbed the charts to hit the number one spot on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] the week of 4 February 1978, remaining there for four consecutive weeks. In the process, it became one of the band's most recognisable tunes, in part because of its place at the beginning of ''[[Saturday Night Fever]]''. In the United States, it would become the second of six consecutive number-one singles, tying the record with [[the Beatles]] for most consecutive number ones in the United States at the time (a record broken by [[Whitney Houston]] who achieved seven consecutive number-ones).\n\n== Writing and recording ==\nThe [[Record producer|executive hello producer]] of the [[Saturday Night Fever (soundtrack)|''Saturday Night Fever'' motion picture soundtrack]] and future Bee Gees manager [[Robert Stigwood]] asked the band to write a few songs for the soundtrack. At this point, the film was in early stages and it did not have a title; in fact, all Stigwood had to go on was a ''[[New York (magazine)|New York]]'' cover story about [[disco]]mania. \n\nThey wrote \"Stayin' Alive\" over the course of a few days while sprawled on the staircase at the [[Ch\u00e2teau d'H\u00e9rouville]] studio near Paris. As with many other artists during the 1970s, the Bee Gees recorded a majority of the soundtrack in France for tax reasons.\n\n[[RSO Records]] wanted the song to share the then-title of the film, \"Saturday Night\", but the Bee Gees refused a title change, insisting that there had been too many songs with \"Saturday\" in the title, and the album already had a song with the word \"night\" in the title\u2014\"Night Fever\". Rather than change the name of the former song to match the film, Stigwood expanded the name of the film to encompass the title of the latter song. Over the years, the brothers have had mixed feelings about the song. On one hand, they admit it brought them tremendous fame; on the other, it led to their being pigeonholed as a disco act, despite a long and varied career before and after.<ref name=\"GB2\"/>\n\nSeveral words from [[Robin Gibb]]'s [[Concorde]] ticket inspired the Gibbs{{clarify|date=May 2016}} to write the lyrics for \"Stayin' Alive\". Robin recalls, \"The subject matter of 'Stayin' Alive' is actually quite a serious one; It's about survival in the streets of [[New York City|New York]], and the lyrics actually say that\". Barry Gibb also recalls, \"People crying out for help. Desperate songs. Those are the ones that become giants. The minute you capture that on record, it's gold. 'Stayin' Alive' is the epitome of that. Everybody struggles against the world, fighting all the bullshit and things that can drag you down. And it really is a victory just to survive. But when you climb back on top and win bigger than ever before, well that's something everybody reacts to everybody\".<ref name=\"everybody\">{{cite book|first= Andrew M\u00f4n |last= Hughes |title= The Bee Gees: Tales Of The Brothers Gibb |year= 2009 |publisher= [[Music Sales Group]] |url= https://books.google.com?id=KugbDQHX0R8C&pg=PT826 |isbn= 978-0-85712-004-5}}</ref> \"We'd also written a song called 'Saturday Night'\", Maurice explains, \"But there were so many songs called 'Saturday Night' even [[Saturday Night (Bay City Rollers song)|one]] by the [[Bay City Rollers]], so when we rewrote it for the movie, we called it 'Stayin' Alive'.<ref>{{cite book|first= Melinda |last= Bilyeu |first2= Hector |last2= Cook |first3= Andrew M\u00f4n |last3= Hughes |title= The Ultimate Biography of the Bee Gees: Tales Of The Brothers Gibb |publisher= Music Sales Group |year= 2013 |url= https://books.google.com?id=Uzv_AgAAQBAJ&pg=PT661 |isbn= 978-0-85712-004-5}}</ref>\n\nThe track was finished at [[Criteria Studios]], with [[Maurice Gibb]] laying down a bass line similar to the guitar riff, Barry Gibb and [[Alan Kendall]] on guitar riffs, and [[Blue Weaver]] adding synthesizers. The Boneroo Horns parts were added. Barry sings falsetto on the whole song, except on the line \"life\u2019s going nowhere, somebody help me\".<ref name=\"GB2\"/> \n\nDue to the death of backing drummer [[Dennis Bryon]]'s mother in the middle of the song's sessions, the group first looked for a replacement. The shortage of qualified drummers in the area prompted the group to try a [[drum machine]], but it did not offer satisfactory results.<ref name=\"Shmoop\"/> After listening to the drum track of the already-recorded \"[[Night Fever]]\", the group and producer Albhy Galuten took two bars from that track, rerecorded them as a recurrent loop on a separate tape, and proceeded with sessions for \"Stayin' Alive\". This accounts for the unchanging rhythm throughout the song. As a joke, the group listed the drummer as \"Bernard Lupe\" (a takeoff on session drummer [[Bernard Purdie]]). Mr. Lupe became a highly sought-after drummer\u2014until it was discovered that he did not exist.<ref name=\"GB2\">{{cite web|first= Joseph |last= Brennan |title= Gibb Songs: 1977 |url= http://www.columbia.edu/~brennan/beegees/77.html |accessdate= 3 February 2013}}</ref>\n\nAlbhy Galuten talks about the recording of \"Stayin' Alive\":\n\n{{quote|Barry and I listened carefully to find a bar that felt really good. Everyone knows that it's more about feel than accuracy in drum tracks. We chose a bar that felt so good that we ended up using that same loop on 'Stayin' Alive,' and 'More Than a Woman,' and then again on Barbra Streisand's song 'Woman in Love.' To make the loop, we copied the drums onto one-quarter-inch tape. Karl spliced the tape and jury rigged it so that it was going over a mic stand and around a plastic reel. At first, we were doing it just as a temporary measure. As we started to lay tracks down to it, we found that it felt really great-very insistent but not machinelike. It had a human feel. By the time we had overdubbed all the parts to the songs and Dennis came back, there was no way we could get rid of the loop.<ref name=\"loop\">{{cite web|first= Mark |last= Small |title= Albhy Galuten tells his story |date= Summer 2002 |publisher= Brothersgibb.org |url= http://www.brothersgibb.org/reports-albhy-galuten.html |accessdate= 27 January 2014}}</ref>}}\n\nIn their work together, Gibb and Galuten had tried playing with a [[click track]] as Galuten explained:\n\n{{quote|While today's musicians know how to get a good groove with the click, back then, if you used a click track you rarely got a good feel. The loop crossed the boundary giving us music that was in time with a good feel. If I had been working for a technology company then and knew what I was doing, I would have tried to patent the idea. Nonetheless, it changed a lot of things. That first loop was a watershed event in our life and times.<ref name=\"loop\"/>}}\n\n==Release==\n{{Refimprove section|date=July 2017}}\nThe song was not initially scheduled for release, with \"[[How Deep Is Your Love (Bee Gees song)|How Deep Is Your Love]]\" selected as lead single, but fans called radio stations and [[RSO Records]] requesting the song immediately after seeing trailers for ''[[Saturday Night Fever]]'', featuring the track over the aforementioned introductory scene. The single was eventually released in mid-December, a month after the album, and moved to the top of the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] in the United States in February, where it would stay for four weeks. Soon after, it would slide to number two, locking in a solid one-two punch with the Bee Gees's third smash hit from the album, \"Night Fever\". In the United Kingdom, \"Stayin' Alive\" was not as popular as it was in the United States, but was still a huge hit, topping out at number four.\n\nFurther demonstrating the Bee Gees's US chart domination in 1978, \"Stayin' Alive\" was replaced at number one with the group's younger brother [[Andy Gibb]]'s single, \"[[(Love Is) Thicker Than Water|Love Is Thicker Than Water]]\", followed by the Bee Gees's \"Night Fever\" for their longest run, seven weeks. This was then replaced by [[Yvonne Elliman]]'s \"[[If I Can't Have You (Bee Gees song)|If I Can't Have You]]\". [[Barry Gibb]] had a hand in writing all four of these songs, becoming the only person in history to write four successive US number-one singles. Besides the version that appeared on the soundtrack album and the edited 45RPM single for Top 40 radio release, there was yet another version, from the same recording session but of a slightly different mix, that was distributed on twelve-inch vinyl to club DJs and radio stations that specialised in airing longer versions of hit songs. This \"Special Disco Version\", as it was called, featured all the same parts as the album version but had a horn rhythm section part interjected twice. Although twelve-inch \"Disco Versions\" were usually sped up, this version was slowed down slightly. This version was finally released on CD when Reprise re-issued ''[[Bee Gees Greatest]]'' in 2007 in an expanded and remastered edition. As for the message of the song, Robin Gibb was quoted as saying, \"'Stayin' Alive' is about survival in the big city\u2014any big city\u2014but especially New York.\" The longest version of \"Stayin' Alive\" ever made was faded at 6:59, and that version was finally released on the remastered version of ''[[Bee Gees Greatest]]''. The album edit is a still generous 4:43, but it was down to 3:29 for the single version.<ref name=\"GB2\"/>\n\nInitial plans were for [[Yvonne Elliman]], then known for ballads, to record \"[[How Deep Is Your Love (Bee Gees song)|How Deep Is Your Love]]\" for ''Saturday Night Fever'', while the Bee Gees produced their own version of the more disco-oriented \"If I Can't Have You\" for the film. Robert Stigwood thought he would prefer the songs from different genders and directed the group to cut the ballad, while Elliman cut \"If I Can't Have You\" with her usual producer [[Freddie Perren]]. Satisfied with this switch, Elliman's interpretation made the soundtrack, while the Bee Gees's version was relegated to the [[A-side and B-side|B-side]] of the \"Stayin' Alive\" single. The brothers' version has since appeared on CD in hits compilations.\n\n[[George Martin]] commented about this song saying: \"The great thing about 'Stayin' Alive' is that it had a great [[guitar]] hook to start with which set up the theme, that pulsating beat. It's no coincidence, by the way, that the disco beat of 120 beats per minute coincides the heartbeat of your heart when you're excited. This was a key thing which underlined the whole tune, and when the vocals came in, the vocals were so designed that they pushed that beat further\".<ref name=\"everybody\"/>\n\n===Music video===\nThe music video for the song is of an entirely different concept from ''Saturday Night Fever''. It was filmed on [[Sony Pictures Studios|MGM Studios]]'s backlot #2 in [[Culver City, California]]. The group was filming the movie, ''[[Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band (film)|Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band]]'' on the lot at the same time. The video featured Quality Street\u2014a set that was used for such films as ''[[The Three Musketeers (1948 film)|The Three Musketeers]]'' and ''[[Young Frankenstein]]''\u2014as well as the Grand Central Station set used in the films ''[[The Band Wagon]]'' and the opening of ''[[That's Entertainment!]]'' with [[Fred Astaire]].<ref>{{cite book|first= Steven |last= Bingen |year= 2011 |title= MGM: Hollywood's Greatest Backlot |isbn= 9781595808936 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=pKePBQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover}}</ref> As the group walks past one of the railway cars in the video, the words \"New York Central\" can be seen printed on the side of the train above a passenger window. The MGM art directors added this bit of authenticity because the actual [[New York Central Railroad]] operated several lines from [[Grand Central Terminal]] in [[New York City]] during the 20th century until 1969.<ref>{{cite magazine|title= Streamline Steam Engine Attains High Speed |date= February 1935 |page= 211 |magazine= [[Popular Mechanics]] |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=yN8DAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA211}}</ref>\n\n==Personnel==\n*[[Barry Gibb]] \u2013 [[Lead vocalist|lead]], [[Backing vocalist|harmony]] and backing vocals, [[rhythm guitar]]\n*[[Robin Gibb]] \u2013 harmony and backing vocals\n*[[Maurice Gibb]] \u2013 harmony and backing vocals, [[Bass guitar|bass]]\n*[[Alan Kendall]] \u2013 [[lead guitar]]\n*[[Dennis Bryon]] (Bernard Lupe) \u2013 [[Drum kit|drums]]\n*[[Blue Weaver]] \u2013 [[Keyboard instrument|keyboards]], [[synthesizer]]\n*[[Joe Lala]] \u2013 [[Percussion instrument|percussion]]\n\n==Track listing==\n*\"Stayin' Alive\" \u2013 3:29\n*\"If I Can't Have You\" \u2013 3:25\n\n===1989 reissue===\n*\"Subway\" \u2013 4:20\n*\"Love So Right\" \u2013 3:33\n\n==Use in medical training==\n\"Stayin' Alive\" was used in a study to train medical professionals to provide the correct number of chest compressions per minute while performing [[cardiopulmonary resuscitation|CPR]].

The song was released on 13 December 1977 as the second single from the ''Saturday Night Fever'' soundtrack. The band co-produced the song with [[Albhy Galuten]] and Karl Richardson. It is one of the Bee Gees' [[signature song]]s. In 2004, \"Stayin' Alive\" was placed at number 189 on the list of [[Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Songs of All Time]].<ref name=\"RS\"/> In 2004, it ranked No. 9 on [[AFI's 100 Years...100 Songs]] survey of top tunes in American cinema. In a UK television poll on [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] in December 2011 it was voted fifth in \"''[[The Nation's Favourite|The Nation's Favourite Bee Gees Song]]''\".<ref>\"The Nation's Favourite Bee Gees Song\". [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]]. 9 December 2011.</ref>\n\nOn its release, \"Stayin' Alive\" climbed the charts to hit the number one spot on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] the week of 4 February 1978, remaining there for four consecutive weeks. In the process, it became one of the band's most recognisable tunes, in part because of its place at the beginning of ''[[Saturday Night Fever]]''. In the United States, it would become the second of six consecutive number-one singles, tying the record with [[the Beatles]] for most consecutive number ones in the United States at the time (a record broken by [[Whitney Houston]] who achieved seven consecutive number-ones).\n\n== Writing and recording ==\nThe [[Record producer|executive producer]] of the [[Saturday Night Fever (soundtrack)|''Saturday Night Fever'' motion picture soundtrack]] and future Bee Gees manager [[Robert Stigwood]] asked the band to write a few songs for the soundtrack. At this point, the film was in early stages and it did not have a title; in fact, all Stigwood had to go on was a ''[[New York (magazine)|New York]]'' cover story about [[disco]]mania. \n\nThey wrote \"Stayin' Alive\" over the course of a few days while sprawled on the staircase at the [[Ch\u00e2teau d'H\u00e9rouville]] studio near Paris. As with many other artists during the 1970s, the Bee Gees recorded a majority of the soundtrack in France for tax reasons.\n\n[[RSO Records]] wanted the song to share the then-title of the film, \"Saturday Night\", but the Bee Gees refused a title change, insisting that there had been too many songs with \"Saturday\" in the title, and the album already had a song with the word \"night\" in the title\u2014\"Night Fever\". Rather than change the name of the former song to match the film, Stigwood expanded the name of the film to encompass the title of the latter song. Over the years, the brothers have had mixed feelings about the song. On one hand, they admit it brought them tremendous fame; on the other, it led to their being pigeonholed as a disco act, despite a long and varied career before and after.<ref name=\"GB2\"/>\n\nSeveral words from [[Robin Gibb]]'s [[Concorde]] ticket inspired the Gibbs{{clarify|date=May 2016}} to write the lyrics for \"Stayin' Alive\". Robin recalls, \"The subject matter of 'Stayin' Alive' is actually quite a serious one; It's about survival in the streets of [[New York City|New York]], and the lyrics actually say that\". Barry Gibb also recalls, \"People crying out for help. Desperate songs. Those are the ones that become giants. The minute you capture that on record, it's gold. 'Stayin' Alive' is the epitome of that. Everybody struggles against the world, fighting all the bullshit and things that can drag you down. And it really is a victory just to survive. But when you climb back on top and win bigger than ever before, well that's something everybody reacts to everybody\".<ref name=\"everybody\">{{cite book|first= Andrew M\u00f4n |last= Hughes |title= The Bee Gees: Tales Of The Brothers Gibb |year= 2009 |publisher= [[Music Sales Group]] |url= https://books.google.com?id=KugbDQHX0R8C&pg=PT826 |isbn= 978-0-85712-004-5}}</ref> \"We'd also written a song called 'Saturday Night'\", Maurice explains, \"But there were so many songs called 'Saturday Night' even [[Saturday Night (Bay City Rollers song)|one]] by the [[Bay City Rollers]], so when we rewrote it for the movie, we called it 'Stayin' Alive'.<ref>{{cite book|first= Melinda |last= Bilyeu |first2= Hector |last2= Cook |first3= Andrew M\u00f4n |last3= Hughes |title= The Ultimate Biography of the Bee Gees: Tales Of The Brothers Gibb |publisher= Music Sales Group |year= 2013 |url= https://books.google.com?id=Uzv_AgAAQBAJ&pg=PT661 |isbn= 978-0-85712-004-5}}</ref>\n\nThe track was finished at [[Criteria Studios]], with [[Maurice Gibb]] laying down a bass line similar to the guitar riff, Barry Gibb and [[Alan Kendall]] on guitar riffs, and [[Blue Weaver]] adding synthesizers. The Boneroo Horns parts were added. Barry sings falsetto on the whole song, except on the line \"life\u2019s going nowhere, somebody help me\".<ref name=\"GB2\"/> \n\nDue to the death of backing drummer [[Dennis Bryon]]'s mother in the middle of the song's sessions, the group first looked for a replacement. The shortage of qualified drummers in the area prompted the group to try a [[drum machine]], but it did not offer satisfactory results.<ref name=\"Shmoop\"/> After listening to the drum track of the already-recorded \"[[Night Fever]]\", the group and producer Albhy Galuten took two bars from that track, rerecorded them as a recurrent loop on a separate tape, and proceeded with sessions for \"Stayin' Alive\". This accounts for the unchanging rhythm throughout the song. As a joke, the group listed the drummer as \"Bernard Lupe\" (a takeoff on session drummer [[Bernard Purdie]]). Mr. Lupe became a highly sought-after drummer\u2014until it was discovered that he did not exist.<ref name=\"GB2\">{{cite web|first= Joseph |last= Brennan |title= Gibb Songs: 1977 |url= http://www.columbia.edu/~brennan/beegees/77.html |accessdate= 3 February 2013}}</ref>\n\nAlbhy Galuten talks about the recording of \"Stayin' Alive\":\n\n{{quote|Barry and I listened carefully to find a bar that felt really good. Everyone knows that it's more about feel than accuracy in drum tracks. We chose a bar that felt so good that we ended up using that same loop on 'Stayin' Alive,' and 'More Than a Woman,' and then again on Barbra Streisand's song 'Woman in Love.' To make the loop, we copied the drums onto one-quarter-inch tape. Karl spliced the tape and jury rigged it so that it was going over a mic stand and around a plastic reel. At first, we were doing it just as a temporary measure. As we started to lay tracks down to it, we found that it felt really great-very insistent but not machinelike. It had a human feel. By the time we had overdubbed all the parts to the songs and Dennis came back, there was no way we could get rid of the loop.<ref name=\"loop\">{{cite web|first= Mark |last= Small |title= Albhy Galuten tells his story |date= Summer 2002 |publisher= Brothersgibb.org |url= http://www.brothersgibb.org/reports-albhy-galuten.html |accessdate= 27 January 2014}}</ref>}}\n\nIn their work together, Gibb and Galuten had tried playing with a [[click track]] as Galuten explained:\n\n{{quote|While today's musicians know how to get a good groove with the click, back then, if you used a click track you rarely got a good feel. The loop crossed the boundary giving us music that was in time with a good feel. If I had been working for a technology company then and knew what I was doing, I would have tried to patent the idea. Nonetheless, it changed a lot of things. That first loop was a watershed event in our life and times.<ref name=\"loop\"/>}}\n\n==Release==\n{{Refimprove section|date=July 2017}}\nThe song was not initially scheduled for release, with \"[[How Deep Is Your Love (Bee Gees song)|How Deep Is Your Love]]\" selected as lead single, but fans called radio stations and [[RSO Records]] requesting the song immediately after seeing trailers for ''[[Saturday Night Fever]]'', featuring the track over the aforementioned introductory scene. The single was eventually released in mid-December, a month after the album, and moved to the top of the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] in the United States in February, where it would stay for four weeks. Soon after, it would slide to number two, locking in a solid one-two punch with the Bee Gees's third smash hit from the album, \"Night Fever\". In the United Kingdom, \"Stayin' Alive\" was not as popular as it was in the United States, but was still a huge hit, topping out at number four.\n\nFurther demonstrating the Bee Gees's US chart domination in 1978, \"Stayin' Alive\" was replaced at number one with the group's younger brother [[Andy Gibb]]'s single, \"[[(Love Is) Thicker Than Water|Love Is Thicker Than Water]]\", followed by the Bee Gees's \"Night Fever\" for their longest run, seven weeks. This was then replaced by [[Yvonne Elliman]]'s \"[[If I Can't Have You (Bee Gees song)|If I Can't Have You]]\". [[Barry Gibb]] had a hand in writing all four of these songs, becoming the only person in history to write four successive US number-one singles. Besides the version that appeared on the soundtrack album and the edited 45RPM single for Top 40 radio release, there was yet another version, from the same recording session but of a slightly different mix, that was distributed on twelve-inch vinyl to club DJs and radio stations that specialised in airing longer versions of hit songs. This \"Special Disco Version\", as it was called, featured all the same parts as the album version but had a horn rhythm section part interjected twice. Although twelve-inch \"Disco Versions\" were usually sped up, this version was slowed down slightly. This version was finally released on CD when Reprise re-issued ''[[Bee Gees Greatest]]'' in 2007 in an expanded and remastered edition. As for the message of the song, Robin Gibb was quoted as saying, \"'Stayin' Alive' is about survival in the big city\u2014any big city\u2014but especially New York.\" The longest version of \"Stayin' Alive\" ever made was faded at 6:59, and that version was finally released on the remastered version of ''[[Bee Gees Greatest]]''. The album edit is a still generous 4:43, but it was down to 3:29 for the single version.<ref name=\"GB2\"/>\n\nInitial plans were for [[Yvonne Elliman]], then known for ballads, to record \"[[How Deep Is Your Love (Bee Gees song)|How Deep Is Your Love]]\" for ''Saturday Night Fever'', while the Bee Gees produced their own version of the more disco-oriented \"If I Can't Have You\" for the film. Robert Stigwood thought he would prefer the songs from different genders and directed the group to cut the ballad, while Elliman cut \"If I Can't Have You\" with her usual producer [[Freddie Perren]]. Satisfied with this switch, Elliman's interpretation made the soundtrack, while the Bee Gees's version was relegated to the [[A-side and B-side|B-side]] of the \"Stayin' Alive\" single. The brothers' version has since appeared on CD in hits compilations.\n\n[[George Martin]] commented about this song saying: \"The great thing about 'Stayin' Alive' is that it had a great [[guitar]] hook to start with which set up the theme, that pulsating beat. It's no coincidence, by the way, that the disco beat of 120 beats per minute coincides the heartbeat of your heart when you're excited. This was a key thing which underlined the whole tune, and when the vocals came in, the vocals were so designed that they pushed that beat further\".<ref name=\"everybody\"/>\n\n===Music video===\nThe music video for the song is of an entirely different concept from ''Saturday Night Fever''. It was filmed on [[Sony Pictures Studios|MGM Studios]]'s backlot #2 in [[Culver City, California]]. The group was filming the movie, ''[[Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band (film)|Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band]]'' on the lot at the same time. The video featured Quality Street\u2014a set that was used for such films as ''[[The Three Musketeers (1948 film)|The Three Musketeers]]'' and ''[[Young Frankenstein]]''\u2014as well as the Grand Central Station set used in the films ''[[The Band Wagon]]'' and the opening of ''[[That's Entertainment!]]'' with [[Fred Astaire]].<ref>{{cite book|first= Steven |last= Bingen |year= 2011 |title= MGM: Hollywood's Greatest Backlot |isbn= 9781595808936 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=pKePBQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover}}</ref> As the group walks past one of the railway cars in the video, the words \"New York Central\" can be seen printed on the side of the train above a passenger window.

The others would still be learning.\"<ref>{{Cite book|title=A tree for poverty: Somali poetry and prose|last=Laurance|first=Margaret|publisher=McMaster University Library Press|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=27}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nAll of these traditions, including [[festival]]s, [[Istunka|martial arts]], dress, literature, sport and games such as [[Shax (board game)|Shax]], have immensely contributed to the enrichment of Somali heritage.\n\n===Music===\n{{Main|Music of Somalia}}\nSomalis have a rich musical heritage centered on traditional Somali [[folklore]]. Most Somali songs are [[Pentatonic scale|pentatonic]]. That is, they only use five [[pitch (music)|pitches]] per [[octave]] in contrast to a [[Heptatonic scale|heptatonic]] (seven note) scale, such as the [[major scale]]. At first listen, Somali music might be mistaken for the sounds of nearby regions such as Ethiopia, [[Sudan]] or [[Arabia]], but it is ultimately recognizable by its own unique tunes and styles. Somali songs are usually the product of collaboration between [[lyricist]]s (''midho''), songwriters (''laxan'') and singers (''Codka'' or \"voice\").<ref>Diriye, pp.170-171</ref>\n\n====Musicians and bands====\n[[File:Saadoaliw1.jpg|thumb|right|Somali singer [[Saado Ali Warsame]].]]\n<!-- citations in link-thrus are sufficient for embedded lists per [[MOS:EMBED]] -->\n*[[Aar Maanta]] \u2013 UK-based Somali singer, composer, writer and music producer.\n*[[Abdi Sinimo]] \u2013 prominent Somali artist and inventor of the [[Balwo]] musical style.\n*[[Abdullahi Qarshe]] \u2013 Somali musician, poet and playwright known for his innovative styles of music, which included a wide variety of musical instruments such as the guitar, piano and [[oud]].\n*[[Ali Feiruz]] \u2013 Somali musician from Djibouti; part of the Radio [[Hargeisa]] generation of Somali artists.\n*[[Dur-Dur]] \u2013 Somali band active during the 1980s and 1990s in Somalia, Djibouti and Ethiopia.\n*[[Hasan Adan Samatar]] \u2013 popular male artist during the 1970s and 80s.\n*[[Jonis Bashir]] \u2013 Somali-Italian actor and singer\n*[[Khadija Qalanjo]] \u2013 popular Somali singer in the 1970s and 1980s.\n*[[K'naan]] \u2013 award-winning Somali-Canadian hip hop artist.\n*[[Magool]] (2 May 1948 \u2013 19 March 2004) \u2013 prominent Somali singer considered in [[Somalia]] as one of the greatest entertainers of all time.\n*[[Maryam Mursal]] (born 1950) \u2013 Somali musician, composer and vocalist whose work has been produced by the record label [[Real World Records|Real World]].\n*[[Mohamed Mooge Liibaan|Mohammed Mooge]] \u2013 Somali artist from the Radio Hargeisa generation.\n*[[Poly Styrene]] \u2013 Somali-British punk rock singer; best known as being the lead singer of [[X Ray Spex]].\n*[[Saado Ali Warsame]] \u2013 Somali singer-songwriter and modern qaraami exponent.\n*[[Waaberi]] \u2013 Somalia's foremost musical group that toured through several countries in Northeast Africa and Asia, including [[Egypt]], [[Sudan]] and [[China]].\n*[[Waayaha Cusub]] \u2013 Somali music collective.

Following the creation of the [[Somali Film Agency]] (SFA) regulatory body in 1975, the local film scene began to expand rapidly. [[Hassan Sheikh Mumin]] was considered one of the most prolific and early playwrights and composers in Somali literature. Mumin's most important work is ''Shabeel Naagood'' (1965), a piece that touches on the social position of women, urbanization, changing traditional practices, and the importance of education during the early pre-independence period. Although the issues it describes were later to some degree redressed, the work remains a mainstay of Somali literature.<ref name=\"Aaasc\">{{cite journal|last=African Studies Center|first=University of California|journal=African Arts|year=1973|volume=7-8|pages=84|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=smBUAAAAMAAJ|accessdate=29 June 2012|title=African Arts}}</ref>  ''Shabeel Naagood'' was translated into English in 1974 under the title ''Leopard Among the Women'' by the [[Somali Studies]] pioneer [[Bogumi\u0142 W. Andrzejewski]], who also wrote the introduction. Mumin composed both the play itself and the music used in it.<ref name=\"Haywardlewis\"/> The piece is regularly featured in various school curricula, including [[Oxford University]], which first published the English translation under its [[Oxford University Press|press house]].\n\nDuring one decisive passage in the play, the heroine, Shallaayo, laments that she has been tricked into a false marriage by the Leopard in the title:\n<center>\n{{Quotation|\"Women have no share in the encampments of this world\n\nAnd it is men who made these laws, to their own advantage.\n\nBy God, by God, men are our enemies, though we ourselves nurtured them\n\nWe suckled them at our breasts, and they maimed us:\n\nWe do not share peace with them.\"}}\n</center>\n\nThe Somali filmmaker [[Ali Said Hassan]] concurrently served as the SFA's representative in Rome. In the 1970s and early 1980s, popular musicals known as ''riwaayado'' were the main driving force behind the Somali movie industry.\n\nEpic and period films as well as international co-productions followed suit, facilitated by the proliferation of [[video]] technology and national television networks. [[Said Salah Ahmed]] during this period directed his first feature film, ''The Somali Darwish'' (''The Somalia Dervishes''), devoted to the Dervish movement. In the 1990s and 2000s, a new wave of more entertainment-oriented movies emerged. Referred to as [[Somaliwood]], this upstart, youth-based cinematic movement has energized the Somali film industry and in the process introduced innovative storylines, marketing strategies and production techniques. The young directors [[Abdisalam Aato]] of Olol Films and Abdi Malik Isak are at the forefront of this quiet revolution.<ref name=\"Somaliwood\">{{cite news|url=http://www.hiiraan.com/news2/2007/may/somaliwood_columbus_has_become_a_haven_for_somali_filmmaking.aspx|title=Somaliwood: Columbus Has Become A Haven for Somali Filmmaking|publisher=The Other Paper|date=19 April 2007|accessdate=25 January 2008}}</ref>\n\n===Art===\n{{Main|Somali art}}\n[[File:Ucidlhd29.png|thumb|left|A Somali woman with [[Kohl (cosmetics)|kohl]] eyes.]]\nSomalis have old visual art traditions, which include pottery, jewelry and wood carving. In the medieval period, affluent urbanites commissioned local wood and marble carvers to work on their interiors and houses. Intricate patterns also adorn the [[mihrab]]s and [[Column|pillars]] of ancient Somali [[mosque]]s. Artistic carving was considered the province of men, whereas the textile industry was mainly that of women. Among the nomads, carving, especially [[woodwork]], was widespread and could be found on the most basic objects such as [[spoon]]s, [[comb]]s and [[bowl (vessel)|bowls]]. It also included more complex structures, such as the portable nomadic house, the ''aqal''. In the last several decades, traditional carving of windows, doors and furniture have given way to workshops employing electrical machinery, which deliver the same results in a far shorter time period.<ref>{{cite book|last=Abdullahi|first=Mohamed Diriye|title=Culture and Customs of Somalia|date=2001|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=978-0313313332|pages=[https://archive.org/details/culturecustomsof00diri/page/97 97]|url=https://archive.org/details/culturecustomsof00diri/page/97}}</ref>\n\nAdditionally, [[henna]] is an important part of Somali culture. It is worn by Somali women on their hands, arms, feet and neck during wedding ceremonies, [[Eid ul-Fitr|Eid]], [[Ramadan]] and other festive occasions. Somali henna designs are similar to those in the Arabian peninsula, often featuring flower motifs and triangular shapes. The palm is also frequently decorated with a dot of henna and the fingertips are dipped in the dye. Henna parties are usually held before the wedding takes place. Somali women have likewise traditionally applied [[Kohl (cosmetics)|kohl]] (''kuul'') to their eyes.<ref name=\"Loughran\">Katheryne S.

The cloth is usually made out of ''alandi'', which is a textile that is common in the Horn region and some parts of North Africa. The garment can be worn in different styles. It can also be made with other fabrics, including white cloth with gold borders. For more formal settings, such as at weddings or religious celebrations like Eid, women wear the ''dirac''. It is a long, light, diaphanous [[voile]] dress made of [[silk]], [[Chiffon (fabric)|chiffon]], [[taffeta]] or saree fabric. The gown is worn over a full-length [[Slip (clothing)|half-slip]] and a brassiere. Known as the ''gorgorad'', the underskirt is made out of silk and serves as a key part of the overall outfit. The dirac is usually sparkly and very colorful, the most popular styles being those with gilded borders or threads.<ref name=\"Abdullahi117\"/>\n\nMarried women tend to wear [[Headscarf|headscarves]] referred to as ''shaash''.

Prior to {{harvnb|Cruciani|La Fratta|Trombetta|Santolamazza|2007}}, {{harvnb|Semino et al.|2004}} East Africa as a possible place of origin of E-M78, based upon Ethiopian testing. This was because of the high frequency and diversity of E-M78 lineages in the region of Ethiopia. However, {{harvnb|Cruciani|La Fratta|Trombetta|Santolamazza|2007}} were able to study more data, including populations from North Africa who were not represented in the {{harvnb|Semino|Magri|Benuzzi|Lin|2004}} study, and found evidence that the E-M78 lineages which make up a significant proportion of some populations in that region, were relatively young branches (see E-V32 below). They therefore concluded that \"Northeast Africa\" was the likely place of origin of E-M78 based on \"the peripheral geographic distribution of the most derived subhaplogroups with respect to northeastern Africa, as well as the results of quantitative analysis of UEP and microsatellite diversity\". So according to {{harvnb|Cruciani|La Fratta|Trombetta|Santolamazza|2007}} E-M35, the parent clade of E-M78, originated in East Africa, subsequently spread to Northeast Africa, and then there was a \"back migration\" of E-M215 chromosomes that had acquired the E-M78 mutation. {{harvnb|Cruciani|La Fratta|Trombetta|Santolamazza|2007}} therefore note this as evidence for \"a corridor for bidirectional migrations\" between Northeast Africa (Egypt and Libya in their data) on the one hand and East Africa on the other.

Our initial results indicate a sharp cline in M1 frequencies that generally does not extend into sub-Saharan Africa. While our North and especially East African samples contained frequencies of M1 over 20%, our sub-Saharan samples consisted almost entirely of the L1 or L2 haplogroups only. In addition, there existed a significant amount of homogeneity within the M1 haplogroup. This sharp cline indicates a history of little admixture between these regions. This could imply a more recent ancestry for M1 in Africa, as older lineages are more diverse and widespread by nature, and may be an indication of a back-migration into Africa from the Middle East.\"<ref name=\"AD.\"/></blockquote>\n\n===Autosomal ancestry===\n[[File:Ethio-Somali component.png|thumb|upright=2.5|Genetic components present in select Cushitic populations]]\n[[File:Northeast_African_genomic_variation_ADMIXTURE_plot.PNG|thumb|upright=2.5|Genetic components present in select Cushitic/HOA populations]]\n[[File:Young Somali man2a.jpg|thumb|A young Somali man.]]\nAccording to an [[Autosome|autosomal DNA]] study by Hodgson et al. (2014), the Afro-Asiatic languages were likely spread across Africa and the Near East by an ancestral population(s) carrying a newly identified non-African genetic component, which the researchers dub the \"Ethio-Somali\". This Ethio-Somali component is today most common among Afro-Asiatic-speaking populations in the Horn of Africa. It reaches a frequency peak among ethnic Somalis, representing the majority of their ancestry. The Ethio-Somali component is most closely related to the Maghrebi non-African genetic component, and is believed to have diverged from all other non-African ancestries at least 23,000 years ago. On this basis, the researchers suggest that the original Ethio-Somali carrying population(s) probably arrived in the pre-agricultural period from the Near East, having crossed over into northeastern Africa via the [[Sinai Peninsula]]. The population then likely split into two branches, with one group heading westward toward the [[Maghreb]] and the other moving south into the Horn.<ref name=\"Hodgson2014\">{{Cite journal|last=Hodgson|first=Jason A.|last2=Mulligan|first2=Connie J.|last3=Al-Meeri|first3=Ali|last4=Raaum|first4=Ryan L.|date=12 June 2014|title=Early Back-to-Africa Migration into the Horn of Africa|journal=PLOS Genetics|volume=10|issue=6|pages=e1004393|doi=10.1371/journal.pgen.1004393|issn=1553-7404|pmc=4055572|pmid=24921250}}</ref> Ancient DNA analysis indicates that this foundational ancestry in the Horn region is akin to that of the Neolithic farmers of the southern [[Levant]].<ref name=\"Lazaridis2016\">{{cite biorxiv|last=Lazaridis|first=Iosif|last2=Nadel|first2=Dani|last3=Rollefson|first3=Gary|last4=Merrett|first4=Deborah C.|last5=Rohland|first5=Nadin|last6=Mallick|first6=Swapan|last7=Fernandes|first7=Daniel|last8=Novak|first8=Mario|last9=Gamarra|first9=Beatriz|date=16 June 2016|title=The genetic structure of the world9s first farmers|biorxiv=059311}}</ref>\n\nAccording to Hodgson et al.

The genetic ancestry of Cushitic and Semitic speaking populations in the Horn of Africa represents ancestries (Ethiopic and Ethio-Somali) not found outside of Cushitic and Semitic speaking HOA populations in any significance. Therefore, both ancestries are distinct, unique to, and considered the signature autosomal genetic ancestry of Cushitic and Semitic speaking HOA populations.\nHodgson et al. states:\n<blockquote>\"The African Ethiopic ancestry is tightly restricted to HOA populations and likely represents an autochthonous HOA population.

Following the creation of the [[Somali Film Agency]] (SFA) regulatory body in 1975, the local film scene began to expand rapidly. [[Hassan Sheikh Mumin]] was considered one of the most prolific and early playrighters and composers in Somali literature. Mumin's most important work is ''Shabeel Naagood'' (1965), a piece that touches on the social position of women, urbanization, changing traditional practices, and the importance of education during the early pre-independence period. Although the issues it describes were later to some degree redressed, the work remains a mainstay of Somali literature.<ref name=\"Aaasc\">{{cite journal|last=African Studies Center|first=University of California|journal=African Arts|year=1973|volume=7-8|pages=84|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=smBUAAAAMAAJ|accessdate=29 June 2012|title=African Arts}}</ref>  ''Shabeel Naagood'' was translated into English in 1974 under the title ''Leopard Among the Women'' by the [[Somali Studies]] pioneer [[Bogumi\u0142 W.

In the 1970s and early 1980s, popular musicals known as ''riwaayado'' were the main driving force behind the Somali movie industry.\n\nEpic and period films as well as international co-productions followed suit, facilitated by the proliferation of [[video]] technology and national television networks. [[Said Salah Ahmed]] during this period directed his first feature film, ''The Somali Darwish'' (''The Somalia Dervishes''), devoted to the Dervish movement. In the 1990s and 2000s, a new wave of more entertainment-oriented movies emerged. Referred to as [[Somaliwood]], this upstart, youth-based cinematic movement has energized the Somali film industry and in the process introduced innovative storylines, marketing strategies and production techniques.

Artistic carving was considered the province of men, whereas the textile industry was mainly that of women.

It also included more complex structures, such as the portable nomadic house, the ''aqal''.

It is a long, light, diaphanous [[voile]] dress made of [[silk]], [[Chiffon (fabric)|chiffon]], [[taffeta]] or saree fabric. The gown is worn over a full-length [[Slip (clothing)|half-slip]] and a brassiere. Known as the ''gorgorad'', the underskirt is made out of silk and serves as a key part of the overall outfit.

The main dish is typically a pancake-like bread (''canjeero'' or ''canjeelo'') similar to Ethiopian [[injera]], but smaller and thinner, or ''muufo'' a Somali flat bread traditionally baked on a clay oven. These breads might also be eaten with a stew (''maraqe'') or soup at lunch or dinner.<ref>Abdullahi, pp.111-114.</ref> ''Qado'' or lunch is often elaborate, varieties of ''bariis'' ([[rice]]), the most popular being [[basmati]] are usually served as the main dish alongside goat, lamb or fish.

Prior to {{harvnb|Cruciani|La Fratta|Trombetta|Santolamazza|2007}}, {{harvnb|Semino et al.|2004}} East Africa as a possible place of origin of E-M78, based upon Ethiopian testing. This was because of the high frequency and diversity of E-M78 lineages in the region of Ethiopia. However, {{harvnb|Cruciani|La Fratta|Trombetta|Santolamazza|2007}} were able to study more data, including populations from North Africa who were not represented in the {{harvnb|Semino|Magri|Benuzzi|Lin|2004}} study, and found evidence that the E-M78 lineages which make up a significant proportion of some populations in that region, were relatively young branches (see E-V32 below). They therefore concluded that \"Northeast Africa\" was the likely place of origin of E-M78 based on \"the peripheral geographic distribution of the most derived subhaplogroups with respect to northeastern Africa, as well as the results of quantitative analysis of UEP and microsatellite diversity\". So according to {{harvnb|Cruciani|La Fratta|Trombetta|Santolamazza|2007}} E-M35, the parent clade of E-M78, originated in East Africa, subsequently spread to Northeast Africa, and then there was a \"back migration\" of E-M215 chromosomes that had acquired the E-M78 mutation. {{harvnb|Cruciani|La Fratta|Trombetta|Santolamazza|2007}} therefore note this as evidence for \"a corridor for bidirectional migrations\" between Northeast Africa (Egypt and Libya in their data) on the one hand and East Africa on the other.

(2014), the Afro-Asiatic languages were likely spread across Africa and the Near East by an ancestral population(s) carrying a newly identified non-African genetic component, which the researchers dub the \"Ethio-Somali\". This Ethio-Somali component is today most common among Afro-Asiatic-speaking populations in the Horn of Africa. It reaches a frequency peak among ethnic Somalis, representing the majority of their ancestry. The Ethio-Somali component is most closely related to the Maghrebi non-African genetic component, and is believed to have diverged from all other non-African ancestries at least 23,000 years ago. On this basis, the researchers suggest that the original Ethio-Somali carrying population(s) probably arrived in the pre-agricultural period from the Near East, having crossed over into northeastern Africa via the [[Sinai Peninsula]]. The population then likely split into two branches, with one group heading westward toward the [[Maghreb]] and the other moving south into the Horn.<ref name=\"Hodgson2014\">{{Cite journal|last=Hodgson|first=Jason A.|last2=Mulligan|first2=Connie J.|last3=Al-Meeri|first3=Ali|last4=Raaum|first4=Ryan L.|date=12 June 2014|title=Early Back-to-Africa Migration into the Horn of Africa|journal=PLOS Genetics|volume=10|issue=6|pages=e1004393|doi=10.1371/journal.pgen.1004393|issn=1553-7404|pmc=4055572|pmid=24921250}}</ref> Ancient DNA analysis indicates that this foundational ancestry in the Horn region is akin to that of the Neolithic farmers of the southern [[Levant]].<ref name=\"Lazaridis2016\">{{cite biorxiv|last=Lazaridis|first=Iosif|last2=Nadel|first2=Dani|last3=Rollefson|first3=Gary|last4=Merrett|first4=Deborah C.|last5=Rohland|first5=Nadin|last6=Mallick|first6=Swapan|last7=Fernandes|first7=Daniel|last8=Novak|first8=Mario|last9=Gamarra|first9=Beatriz|date=16 June 2016|title=The genetic structure of the world9s first farmers|biorxiv=059311}}</ref>\n\nAccording to Hodgson et al.

Therefore, both ancestries are distinct, unique to, and considered the signature autosomal genetic ancestry of Cushitic and Semitic speaking HOA populations.\nHodgson et al. states:\n<blockquote>\"The African Ethiopic ancestry is tightly restricted to HOA populations and likely represents an autochthonous HOA population.

Among those used are:\n\n* Wei\u00dfbier, short Wei\u00dfe: \"Wei\u00df\" is [[Germany|German]] for \"white\". These terms are used almost exclusively in the southern German state of [[Bavaria]] and in [[Austria]].\n* Weizenbier, short Weizen: \"Weizen\" is German for \"wheat\". These terms are used in the western ([[Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg]]) and northern German regions for Wei\u00dfbier. \n* Hefewei\u00dfbier or Hefeweizen: \"Hefe\" is the German word for yeast, added to indicate that the beer is [[bottle-conditioned]] (unfiltered) and thus might have sediment.\n* Kristallwei\u00dfbier or Kristallweizen: \"Kristall\" being German for crystal, added if Wei\u00dfbier is [[filtered beer|filtered]] clear of sediment.\n* Dunkles Wei\u00dfbier or Dunkelweizen: a dark version of a wheat beer (\"dunkel\" is the German word for \"dark\").\n* Weizenbock is a wheat beer made in the [[bock]] [[beer style|style]] originating in Germany.\n* Witbier (Literally, \"white beer\") or simply Wit: Dutch language name for the Belgian style of wheat beer.\n* Bi\u00e8re blanche (Literally, \"white beer\"): The French language name for wheat beer.\n\n==Serving==\nBavarian-style wheat beer is usually served in {{convert|500|ml|USoz|abbr=on}}, vase-shaped glasses. In Belgium, witbier is usually served in a 250ml glass; each brewery (Hoegaarden, Dentergems, etc.) has its own shape of glass. Berliner Wei\u00dfe is often served in a [[schooner (glass)|schooner]].\n\nKristallweizen (especially in Austria) and American styles of wheat beer are sometimes served with a slice of lemon or orange in the glass. This is not traditional in Bavaria, and is generally frowned upon there.<ref name = \"Warner\" /> The modern American custom appears to have originated in [[Portland, Oregon]] in the mid-1980s, where the Dublin Pub served [[Widmer Brothers Brewery]]'s Weizenbier with a slice of lemon, to accentuate the citrus flavor of the [[Cascade hop]]s.<ref name=Tepedelen>{{cite web \n|title=Hefeweizen Facts And Fiction\n|url=http://imbibemagazine.com/hazed-and-confused-hefeweizen/ \n|author=Adem Tepedelen\n|date=18 January 2009\n|work=Imbibe}}</ref>\n\nIn northern Bavaria, it is common to add a grain of rice to kristallweizen, which causes a gentle bubbling effect and results in a longer-lasting foam.<ref>[http://www.food-from-bavaria.de/en/reg_spez/einzelprodukt.php?an=100&display_lang=en Weizenbier or wheat beer] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071106215730/http://www.food-from-bavaria.de/en/reg_spez/einzelprodukt.php?an=100&display_lang=en |date=6 November 2007 }}</ref> A common item on pub menus in Bavaria is [[Shandy|cola-weizen]], which is a mix of cola and Weizenbier.

Other phenolics sometimes found in Wei\u00dfbiers evoke medicinal or smoky sensations. The bittering level of most Wei\u00dfbiers is close to 15 [[International Bitterness Units]], a very low level. Hop flavor and aroma are typically low.<ref name=\"Warner\"/>\n\nThe ester and phenolic aspects are produced by the special type of yeast, rather than the high fraction of wheat in the grain bill.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}\n\nThe [[carbonation]] level can range from 5.5&nbsp;grams per liter (approximately 2.7 volumes; slightly higher than that of most other German beers) to 7&nbsp;grams per liter, or more.

It is a descendant from those medieval beers which were flavored and preserved with a blend of spices and other plants such as [[coriander]], [[orange (fruit)|orange]], and [[bitter orange]] referred to as \"[[gruit]]\" instead of using [[hops]].\n\nThe style was revived by [[Pierre Celis]] at the [[Hoegaarden Brewery]] in Belgium<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.beerhunter.com/documents/19133-000215.html |title=Michael Jackson's Beer Hunter \u2013 Belgium's Great Beers |publisher=www.beerhunter.com |accessdate=17 October 2009 }}</ref> and the [[Celis (beer)|Celis]] Brewery in the United States<ref>{{cite book |first1=Michael |last1=Jackson |title=Pocket Guide to Beer |type=Hardcover |page=208 |publisher=Running Press |edition=7 |date=10 August 2000 |isbn=978-0-7624-0885-6}} {{ISBN|978-0-7624-0885-6}}.</ref> and is traditionally made with up to 50% [[Mash ingredients#Wheat|raw wheat]] rather than wheat [[malt]].<ref name=handbook>{{cite book|last=E\u00dflinger|first=Hans Michael|title=Handbook of Brewing: Processes, Technology, Markets|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=L8RwjqUKLygC&pg=PT101|year=2009|publisher=Wiley|isbn=978-3-527-31674-8|page=101}}</ref> The beers have a somewhat [[sour]] taste due to the presence of [[lactic acid]] or [[acetic acid]], much more pronounced in the past than today.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://morebeer.com/brewingtechniques/library/styles/2_4style.html |title=BT \u2013 Witbier: Belgian White |publisher=Morebeer.com |accessdate=2013-08-14}}</ref> Also, the suspended yeast in the beer causes some continuing fermentation in the bottle.\n\n===Other varieties===\n{{Main article|Berliner Wei\u00dfe|Gose|Lambic|Grodziskie }}\n\nA minor variety of wheat beer is represented by [[Berliner Wei\u00dfe]] (Berlin White), which is low in alcohol (2.5% to 3% ABV) and intentionally tart. Sweetened syrups of lemon, raspberry or [[Galium odoratum|woodruff]] herb are often added before drinking.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}\n\nLeipziger [[Gose]] is similar to Berliner Wei\u00dfe but slightly stronger at around 4% ABV. Its ingredients include coriander and salt, which are unusual for German beers.\n\nBelgian [[Lambic]] is also made with wheat and barley, but differs from nearly all beers in the use of wild yeast for [[spontaneous fermentation]].\n\nA variation on the [[barley wine]] style involves adding a large quantity of [[wheat]] to the mash bill, resulting in what is referred to as '''wheat wine'''. This style originated in the United States in the 1980s.<ref>{{cite web|last=Bernstein|first=Joshua M.|title=Wheat of the Moment|url=http://imbibemagazine.com/Wheat-Wine-Ales|publisher=[[Imbibe Magazine]]|accessdate=12 January 2014|date=17 October 2012}}</ref>\n\n==Names and types==\nWheat beers vary in name according to the place in which they are brewed and small variations in the recipe.  Among those used are:\n\n* Wei\u00dfbier, short Wei\u00dfe: \"Wei\u00df\" is [[Germany|German]] for \"white\". These terms are used almost exclusively in the southern German state of [[Bavaria]] and in [[Austria]].\n* Weizenbier, short Weizen: \"Weizen\" is German for \"wheat\". These terms are used in the western ([[Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg]]) and northern German regions for Wei\u00dfbier. \n* Hefewei\u00dfbier or Hefeweizen: \"Hefe\" is the German word for yeast, added to indicate that the beer is [[bottle-conditioned]] (unfiltered) and thus might have sediment.\n* Kristallwei\u00dfbier or Kristallweizen: \"Kristall\" being German for crystal, added if Wei\u00dfbier is [[filtered beer|filtered]] clear of sediment.\n* Dunkles Wei\u00dfbier or Dunkelweizen: a dark version of a wheat beer (\"dunkel\" is the German word for \"dark\").\n* Weizenbock is a wheat beer made in the [[bock]] [[beer style|style]] originating in Germany.\n* Witbier (Literally, \"white beer\") or simply Wit: Dutch language name for the Belgian style of wheat beer.\n* Bi\u00e8re blanche (Literally, \"white beer\"): The French language name for wheat beer.\n\n==Serving==\nBavarian-style wheat beer is usually served in {{convert|500|ml|USoz|abbr=on}}, vase-shaped glasses. In Belgium, witbier is usually served in a 250ml glass; each brewery (Hoegaarden, Dentergems, etc.) has its own shape of glass. Berliner Wei\u00dfe is often served in a [[schooner (glass)|schooner]].\n\nKristallweizen (especially in Austria) and American styles of wheat beer are sometimes served with a slice of lemon or orange in the glass. This is not traditional in Bavaria, and is generally frowned upon there.<ref name = \"Warner\" /> The modern American custom appears to have originated in [[Portland, Oregon]] in the mid-1980s, where the Dublin Pub served [[Widmer Brothers Brewery]]'s Weizenbier with a slice of lemon, to accentuate the citrus flavor of the [[Cascade hop]]s.<ref name=Tepedelen>{{cite web \n|title=Hefeweizen Facts And Fiction\n|url=http://imbibemagazine.com/hazed-and-confused-hefeweizen/ \n|author=Adem Tepedelen\n|date=18 January 2009\n|work=Imbibe}}</ref>\n\nIn northern Bavaria, it is common to add a grain of rice to kristallweizen, which causes a gentle bubbling effect and results in a longer-lasting foam.<ref>[http://www.food-from-bavaria.de/en/reg_spez/einzelprodukt.php?an=100&display_lang=en Weizenbier or wheat beer] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071106215730/http://www.food-from-bavaria.de/en/reg_spez/einzelprodukt.php?an=100&display_lang=en |date=6 November 2007 }}</ref> A common item on pub menus in Bavaria is [[Shandy|cola-weizen]], which is a mix of cola and Weizenbier. Another mixture popular during the summer is a [[radler]] variant with a 50\u201350 mix of Wei\u00dfbier with lemonade called \"Russ\", which is the German term for Russian.\n\nWhen serving a bottled unfiltered wheat beer hold the glass on an angle and pour slowly. With about 10% or 15% left swirl smoothly to suspend the yeast, then add to improve the flavor, scent and appearance.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}\n\n==Sensory profile==\nWei\u00dfbiers feature fermentation by-products such as [[ester]]s (which lend fruity flavors and aromas), especially [[isoamyl acetate]], reminiscent of bananas, and the [[natural phenol|phenolic compound]] [[guaiacol]], a metabolite of [[ferulic acid]], which smells and tastes like [[clove]]s. Other phenolics sometimes found in Wei\u00dfbiers evoke medicinal or smoky sensations. The bittering level of most Wei\u00dfbiers is close to 15 [[International Bitterness Units]], a very low level. Hop flavor and aroma are typically low.<ref name=\"Warner\"/>\n\nThe ester and phenolic aspects are produced by the special type of yeast, rather than the high fraction of wheat in the grain bill.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}\n\nThe [[carbonation]] level can range from 5.5&nbsp;grams per liter (approximately 2.7 volumes; slightly higher than that of most other German beers) to 7&nbsp;grams per liter, or more. This produces a generous stand of foam, especially in light of the high protein content of wheat malt.<ref name=\"Warner\"/>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Beer glassware]]\n*[[Beer in Belgium]]\n*[[Beer in Germany]]\n*[[Rye beer]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n;Bibliography\n*''German Wheat Beer'', Eric Warner, Brewers Publications (1992), {{ISBN|0-937381-34-9}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons|Beers_from_Germany|German Beers}}\n* [http://www.bjcp.org/2008styles/style15.php  Beer Judge Certification Program (BJCP) wheat beer style guidelines]\n{{Beer Styles}}\n{{Brewers of wheat beer}}\n{{Wheat}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=August 2019}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Wheat Beer}}\n[[Category:Beer styles]]\n[[Category:Wheat-based drinks]]\n", "name_user": "Dawnseeker2000", "label": "safe", "comment": "MOS:DATEUNIFY (audit)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wheat_beer"}

These serve as meeting places for [[phreak]]ers, [[hacker (computer security)|hackers]], and [[computer security|security]] professionals.\n\nThe actual events, time-spans, and details of various themes of these conventions not only depends on the specific convention attended but also its perceived reputation. Typically the actual details of any given convention are couched in mild secrecy due to the legality of certain panels, as well as the willingness of attendees to explain themselves to law enforcement and less computer-savvy individuals (see [[hacker definition controversy]]).\n\nCommon topics include [[wardriving]], [[lockpicking]], corporate and network security, personal rights and freedoms, new technologies, as well as general 'geek' motifs. Some may also have contests and general collaborative events such as [[hackathon]]s.\n\n[[File:HackerCon Badges.jpg|thumb|right|A variety of electronic and non-electronic hacker conference badges]]\nOne facet of Hacker conferences that tends to differentiate many \"HackerCons\" from general computer security conferences, is the evolution of the conference badge. While many conferences use a fairly standard paper/plastic badge to identify attendees by name, many hacker con's have evolved to use more non-traditional badges, such as electronic PCB's with LED's, LCD screens, and can include wifi and advanced, often hidden functionality, to include games, that do not identify the individual, sometimes promoting a group identity or regional/local group affiliation. This has spurred the creation of so-called \"badgelife\" where different individuals and organizations (such as local hacker groups) may design, create, and sell or otherwise distribute a separate badge attendees wear in addition to their conference badge. These badges may be purchased, but some may have to be earned by completing a challenge at the conference. One of the rarest and most desirable badges is the [[DEF_CON#Black_Badge|DefCon Black Badge]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/vbne9a/a-history-of-badgelife-def-cons-unlikely-obsession-with-artistic-circuit-boards |title=A History of Badgelife, Def Con's Unlikely Obsession with Artistic Circuit Boards |publisher=motherboard.vice.com |accessdate=2019-01-14}}</ref> While the use of the badges are traditionally associated with DefCon, their use has spread to other conferences.\n\n=== List of hacker conferences ===<!-- PLEASE RESPECT ALPHABETIAL ORDER -->\n* AthCon, the largest hacker conference in South Eastern Europe taking place annually in Athens, Greece.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.athcon.org |accessdate=May 3, 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100403092901/http://www.athcon.org/ |archivedate=April 3, 2010 | title=Internet Archive waybackmachine }}</ref>\n* [[Security BSides|BSides]], community conference that initially started in the US is now global.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.securitybsides.com |title=Security B-Sides |publisher=Securitybsides.com |accessdate=2013-04-05}}</ref>\n*[https://www.blackhoodie.re/ Blackhoodie], is a series of free, women-only reverse engineering conference offering workshops and talks.

These serve as meeting places for [[phreak]]ers, [[hacker (computer security)|hackers]], and [[computer security|security]] professionals.\n\nThe actual events, time-spans, and details of various themes of these conventions not only depends on the specific convention attended but also its perceived reputation. Typically the actual details of any given convention are couched in mild secrecy due to the legality of certain panels, as well as the willingness of attendees to explain themselves to law enforcement and less computer-savvy individuals (see [[hacker definition controversy]]).\n\nCommon topics include [[wardriving]], [[lockpicking]], corporate and network security, personal rights and freedoms, new technologies, as well as general 'geek' motifs. Some may also have contests and general collaborative events such as [[hackathon]]s.\n\n[[File:HackerCon Badges.jpg|thumb|right|A variety of electronic and non-electronic hacker conference badges]]\nOne facet of Hacker conferences that tends to differentiate many \"HackerCons\" from general computer security conferences, is the evolution of the conference badge. While many conferences use a fairly standard paper/plastic badge to identify attendees by name, many hacker con's have evolved to use more non-traditional badges, such as electronic PCB's with LED's, LCD screens, and can include wifi and advanced, often hidden functionality, to include games, that do not identify the individual, sometimes promoting a group identity or regional/local group affiliation. This has spurred the creation of so-called \"badgelife\" where different individuals and organizations (such as local hacker groups) may design, create, and sell or otherwise distribute a separate badge attendees wear in addition to their conference badge. These badges may be purchased, but some may have to be earned by completing a challenge at the conference.

Plot summaries for films on Wikipedia are recommended to be between 400-700 words. All edits in this section are logged and reviewed. Please see WP:FILMPLOT for more information. Thank you. -->\n\nIn [[New York Harbor]], filmmaker [[Carl Denham]], known for wildlife films in remote and exotic locations, charters Captain Englehorn's ship, the ''Venture'', for his new project. However, he is unable to secure an actress for a female role he has been reluctant to disclose. Searching in the streets of [[New York City]], he finds Ann Darrow and promises her the adventure of a lifetime. The crew boards the ''Venture'' and sets off, during which the ship's first mate [[Jack Driscoll|Jack Driscoll]], falls in love with Ann.\n\nDenham reveals to the crew that their destination is in fact [[Skull Island]], an uncharted territory. He alludes to a monstrous creature named ''Kong'', rumored to dwell on the island. The crew arrives and anchor offshore. They encounter a native village, separated from the rest of the island by an ancient stone wall. They witness a group of natives preparing to sacrifice a young woman termed the \"bride of Kong\". The intruders are spotted and the native chief stops the ceremony. When he sees Ann, he offers to trade six of his tribal women for the \"golden woman\". They rebuff him and return to the ''Venture''.\n\nThat night, the natives kidnap Ann from the ship and take her through the wall gate and to an altar, where she is offered to [[King Kong]], an enormous [[gorilla]]-like creature. Kong carries a terrified Ann into the wilderness as Denham, Jack and some volunteers enter the jungle in hopes of rescuing her. They are ambushed by another giant creature, a ''[[Stegosaurus]]'', which they manage to defeat. After facing a ''[[Brontosaurus]]'' and Kong himself, Jack and Denham are the only survivors.\n\nA ''[[Tyrannosaurus|Tyrannosaurus rex]]'' attacks Ann and Kong, but he kills it in the battle. Meanwhile, Jack continues to follow them, while Denham returns to the village for more men. Upon arriving in Kong's lair, Ann is menaced by a snake-like ''[[Elasmosaurus]]'', which Kong also kills. While Kong is distracted killing a ''[[Pteranodon]]'' that tried to fly away with Ann, Jack reaches her and they climb down a vine dangling from a cliff ledge. When Kong notices and starts pulling them back up, the two fall unharmed. They run through the jungle and back to the village, where Denham, Englehorn, and the surviving crewmen are waiting. Kong, following, breaks open the gate and relentlessly rampages through the village. Onshore, Denham, now determined to bring Kong back alive, knocks him unconscious with a gas bomb.\n\nShackled in chains, Kong is taken to New York City and presented to a Broadway theatre audience as \"King Kong, the Eighth Wonder of the World\". Ann and Jack are brought on stage to join him, surrounded by a group of press photographers. Kong, believing that the ensuing flash photography is an attack, breaks loose. The audience flees in horror. Ann is whisked away to a hotel room on a high floor, but Kong, scaling the building, soon finds her. His hand smashes through the hotel room window, shoves Jack aside, and abducts Ann again. Kong rampages through the city as Ann screams in his grip. He wrecks a crowded elevated train and then climbs the [[Empire State Building]]. At its top, he is attacked by four airplanes. Kong destroys one, but finally succumbs to their gunfire. He gazes sorrowfully at Ann one last time before falling to his death. Jack takes an elevator to the top of the building and reunites with Ann. Denham arrives and pushes through a crowd surrounding Kong's corpse in the street. When a policeman remarks that the planes got him, Denham tells him, \"No, it wasn't the airplanes. It was Beauty  killed the Beast\".\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Fay Wray]] as Ann Darrow\n* [[Robert Armstrong (actor)|Robert Armstrong]] as [[Carl Denham]]\n* [[Bruce Cabot]] as [[Jack Driscoll|John \u201cJack\u201d Driscoll]]\n* [[Frank Reicher]] as Captain Englehorn\n* [[Sam Hardy (actor)|Sam Hardy]] as Charles Weston\n* [[Noble Johnson]] as the Native Chief\n* [[Steve Clemente]] as the Witch King\n* [[James Flavin]] as Briggs, 2nd Mate\n* [[Victor Wong (actor born 1906)|Victor Wong]] as Charlie the Cook (uncredited)\n* [[Everett Brown]] as the Native in [[Ape]] Costume (uncredited)\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Background==\n[[File:King Kong (1933), Brontosaur.jpeg|thumb|An articulated skeleton of the ''[[Brontosaurus]]'' used in the film.]]\nBefore ''King Kong'' entered production, a long tradition of jungle films existed, and, whether drama or documentary, such films (for example ''[[Stark Mad]]'') generally adhered to a narrative pattern that followed an explorer or scientist into the jungle to test a theory only to discover some monstrous aberration in the undergrowth. In these films, scientific knowledge could be subverted at any time, and it was this that provided the genre with its vitality, appeal, and endurance.<ref name=\"Peary\">Peary</ref>\n\nIn the early 20th century, few zoos had [[primate]] exhibits so there was popular demand to see them on film. At the turn of the 20th century, the [[Lumi\u00e8re Brothers]] sent film documentarians to places westerners had never seen, and [[Georges M\u00e9li\u00e8s]] utilized [[trick photography]] in film fantasies that prefigured that in ''King Kong''. Jungle films were launched in the United States with ''Beasts in the Jungle'' (1913), and the film's popularity spawned similar pictures such as ''[[Tarzan of the Apes (1918 film)|Tarzan of the Apes]]'' (1918).<ref name=\"Peary\"/> ''[[The Lost World (1925 film)|The Lost World]]'' (1925), made movie history with special effects by [[Willis O'Brien]] and a crew that later would work on ''King Kong''.<ref>Morton 21</ref> ''King Kong'' producer [[Ernest B.

Capitalizing on this trend, Congo Pictures released the [[Mockumentary|hoax documentary]] ''[[Ingagi]]'' (1930), advertising the film as \"an authentic incontestable celluloid document showing the sacrifice of a living woman to mammoth gorillas.\" ''Ingagi'' is now often recognized as a racial [[exploitation film]] as it implicitly depicted black women having sex with gorillas, and baby offspring that looked more ape than human.<ref>Gerald Peary, [http://www.geraldpeary.com/essays/jkl/kingkong-1.html 'Missing Links: The Jungle Origins of King Kong' (1976)], repr.

Although Cooper never listed ''Ingagi'' among his influences for ''King Kong,'' it has long been held that RKO green-lit ''Kong'' because of the bottom-line example of ''Ingagi'' and the formula that \"gorillas plus sexy women in peril equals enormous profits\".<ref>{{cite news | first=Andrew | last=Erish | title=Illegitimate Dad of King Kong | date=January 8, 2006| newspaper=Los Angeles Times | url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/latimes/access/959395991.html?dids=959395991:959395991&FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT&type=current&date=Jan+8%2C+2006&author=Andrew+Erish&pub=Los+Angeles+Times&edition=&startpage=E.6&desc=Movies}}</ref>\n\n==Development==\n\n===Concept===\n<!-- This entire section has been sourced from Ray Morton's ''King Kong''.

Cooper]]'s fascination with gorillas began with his boyhood reading of [[Paul Du Chaillu]]'s ''Explorations and Adventures in Equatorial Africa'' (1861) and was furthered in 1929 by studying a tribe of [[baboon]]s in Africa while filming ''The Four Feathers''. After reading W. Douglas Burden's ''The Dragon Lizards of Komodo'', he fashioned a scenario depicting African gorillas battling [[Komodo dragon]]s intercut with artificial stand-ins for joint shots. He then narrowed the ''[[dramatis personae]]'' to one ferocious, lizard-battling gorilla (rather than a group) and included a lone woman on expedition to appease those critics who belabored him for neglecting romance in his films. A remote island would be the setting and the gorilla would be dealt a spectacular death in New York City.<ref>Morton 17\u20138</ref>\n\nCooper took his concept to [[Paramount Studios]] in the first years of the [[Great Depression in the United States|Great Depression]] but executives shied away from a project that sent film crews on costly shoots to Africa and Komodo. In 1931, [[David O. Selznick]] brought Cooper to RKO as his executive assistant and promised him he could make his own films. Cooper began immediately developing ''[[The Most Dangerous Game (film)|The Most Dangerous Game]]'', and hired [[Ernest B. Schoedsack]] to direct. A huge jungle stage set was built, with Robert Armstrong and Fay Wray as the stars. Once the film was underway, Cooper turned his attention to the studio's big-budget-out-of-control fantasy, ''[[Creation (1931 film)|Creation]]'', a project with [[stop motion]] [[animation|animator]] [[Willis O'Brien]] about a group of travelers shipwrecked on an island of [[dinosaur]]s.<ref>Morton 18\u201320</ref>\n\nWhen Cooper screened O'Brien's stop-motion ''Creation'' footage, he was unimpressed, but realized he could economically make his gorilla picture by scrapping the Komodo dragons and costly location shoots for O'Brien's animated dinosaurs and the studio's existing jungle set. It was at this time Cooper probably cast his gorilla as a giant named Kong, and planned to have him die at the [[Empire State Building]]. The RKO board was wary about the project, but gave its approval after Cooper organized a presentation with Wray, Armstrong, and Cabot, and O'Brien's model dinosaurs. In his executive capacity, Cooper ordered the ''Creation'' production shelved, and put its crew to work on ''Kong''.<ref>Morton 22\u20135</ref>\n<!-- This entire section has been sourced from Ray Morton's ''King Kong''.

Cooper understood the commercial appeal of Wallace's work and planned to publicize the film as being \"based on the novel by Edgar Wallace\". Wallace conferred with Cooper and O'Brien (who contributed, among other things, the \"Ann's dress\" scene) and began work on January 1, 1932. He completed a rough draft called ''The Beast'' on January 5, 1932. Cooper thought the draft needed considerable work but Wallace died on February 10, 1932, just after beginning revisions.<ref name=\"Peary\"/><ref name=\"Morton25-7\">Morton, p. 25\u20137</ref> Despite not using any of the draft in the final production beyond the previously agreed upon plot outline, Cooper gave a screen credit to Wallace as he had promised it as a producer.\n\nCooper called in [[James Ashmore Creelman]] (who was working on the script of ''[[The Most Dangerous Game (film)|The Most Dangerous Game]]'' at the time) and the two men worked together on several drafts under the title ''The Eighth Wonder''. Some details from Wallace's rough draft were dropped, such as his boatload of escaped convicts. Wallace's Danby Denham character, a big game hunter, became film director Carl Denham. His Shirley became Ann Darrow and her lover-convict John became Jack Driscoll. The \u201cbeauty and the beast\u201d angle was first developed at this time. Kong's escape was switched from [[Madison Square Garden]] to [[Yankee Stadium]] and (finally) to a Broadway theater. Cute moments involving the gorilla in Wallace's draft were cut because Cooper wanted Kong hard and tough in the belief that his fall would be all the more awesome and tragic.<ref name=\"Morton25-7\"/>\n\nTime constraints forced Creelman to temporarily drop ''The Eighth Wonder'' and devote his time to the ''Game'' script. RKO staff writer [[Horace McCoy]] was called in to work with Cooper, and it was he who introduced the island natives, a giant wall, and the sacrificial maidens into the plot. [[Leon Gordon (playwright)|Leon Gordon]] also contributed to the screenplay in a minimal capacity; both he and McCoy went uncredited in the completed film.<ref name=\"erb31\">Erb, p. 31</ref> When Creelman returned to the script full-time, he hated McCoy's \u201cmythic elements\u201d, believing the script already had too many over-the-top concepts, but Cooper insisted on keeping them in. RKO head Selznick and his executives wanted Kong introduced earlier in the film (believing the audience would grow bored waiting for his appearance), but Cooper persuaded them that a suspenseful build-up would make Kong's entrance all the more exciting.<ref name=\"Morton28\">Morton, p. 28</ref>\n\nCooper felt Creelman's final draft was slow-paced, too full of flowery dialogue, weighted-down with long scenes of exposition,<ref name=\"Morton28\"/> and written on a scale that would have been prohibitively expensive to film.<ref name=\"Goldner page unknown\">Goldner (page unknown)</ref> Writer [[Ruth Rose]] (Schoedsack's wife) was brought in to for rewrites and, although she had never written a screenplay, undertook the task with a complete understanding of Cooper's style, streamlining the script and tightening the action. Rather than explaining how Kong would be transported to New York, for example, she simply cut from the island to the theater. She incorporated autobiographical elements into the script with Cooper mirrored in the Denham character, her husband Schoedsack in the tough but tender Driscoll character, and herself in struggling actress Ann Darrow. Rose also rewrote the dialogue and created the film's opening sequence, showing Denham meeting Ann on the streets of New York. Cooper was delighted with Rose's script, approving the newly re-titled ''Kong'' for production.<ref>Morton, p. 28\u20139</ref> Cooper and Schoedsack decided to co-direct scenes but their styles were different (Cooper was slow and meticulous, Schoedsack brisk) and they finally agreed to work separately, with Cooper overseeing O'Brien's miniature work and directing the special effects sequences, and Schoedsack directing the dialogue scenes.<ref>Morton, p. 29</ref>\n<!-- This entire section has been principally sourced from Ray Morton's ''King Kong''.

She met ''Kong'' co-directors Cooper and Schoedsack when cast as Ethne Eustace in ''[[The Four Feathers (1929 film)|The Four Feathers]]'' (1929). Cooper cast her as Eve Trowbridge in ''[[The Most Dangerous Game (film)|The Most Dangerous Game]]'' (1932).<ref name=\"Morton31-3\">Morton 31\u20133</ref> After the RKO board approved the ''Kong'' test, Cooper decided a blonde would provide contrast to the gorilla's dark pelt. [[Dorothy Jordan (film actress)|Dorothy Jordan]], [[Jean Harlow]], and [[Ginger Rogers]] were considered, but the role finally went to Wray who wore a blonde wig in the film and was inspired more by Cooper's enthusiasm than the script to accept the role. According to her autobiography, ''On the Other Hand'', Wray recounts that Cooper had told her he planned to star her opposite the \"tallest, darkest leading man in Hollywood\". She assumed he meant [[Clark Gable]] until he showed her a picture of Kong climbing the Empire State Building.<ref name=\"Morton31-3\"/> On the film's 50th anniversary in 1983, one New York theater held a Fay Wray scream-alike contest in its lobby,<ref name=\"erb31\" /> and on August 10, 2004, two days after Wray died, the lights of the [[Empire State Building]] were dimmed for 15 minutes in her memory.<ref>United Press International</ref>\n* [[Robert Armstrong (actor)|Robert Armstrong]]\n[[File:Robert Armstrong.JPG|right|thumb|Armstrong featured in [[Trailer (promotion)|trailer]] for later film, ''[[The Ex-Mrs. Bradford]]'' (1936)]]\n:[[Michigan]] native and veteran [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] and [[silent film]] character actor [[Robert Armstrong (actor)|Robert Armstrong]] played Wray's alcoholic brother in ''The Most Dangerous Game'' and, during filming, became a member of the Cooper-Schoedsack inner circle.

Retrieved 1st February 2017</ref>\n\nKong's torso was streamlined to eliminate the comical appearance of the real world gorilla's prominent belly and buttocks. His lips, eyebrows, and nose were fashioned of rubber, his eyes of glass, and his facial expressions controlled by thin, bendable wires threaded through holes drilled in his aluminum skull. During filming, Kong's rubber skin dried out quickly under studio lights, making it necessary to replace it often and completely rebuild his facial features.<ref>Morton 33\u20135</ref>\n[[Image:Img kingkong1.jpg|thumb|right|The [[stop-motion]] animated King Kong atop the [[Empire State Building]] and battling a [[Curtiss F8C Helldiver]] airplane]]\nA huge bust of Kong's head, neck, and upper chest was made of wood, cloth, rubber, and bearskin by Delgado, E.

The other hand and arm had articulated fingers, was mounted on a lever to elevate it, and was used in the several scenes in which Kong grasps Ann. A non articulated leg was created of materials similar to the hands, mounted on a crane, and used to stomp on Kong's victims.<ref>Morton 36</ref>\n[[File:T. rex old posture.jpg|left|thumb|[[Charles R.

Knight]]'s murals in the [[American Museum of Natural History]] in New York City. All the armatures were manufactured in the RKO machine shop. Materials used were cotton, foam rubber, latex sheeting, and liquid latex. Football bladders were placed inside some models to simulate breathing.{{Citation needed|date=June 2016}} A scale of one-inch-equals-one-foot was employed and models ranged from 18 inches to 3 feet in length. Several of the models were originally built for ''Creation'' and sometimes two or three models were built of individual species. Prolonged exposure to studio lights wreaked havoc with the latex skin so John Cerasoli carved wooden duplicates of each model to be used as stand-ins for test shoots and lineups. He carved wooden models of Ann, Driscoll, and other human characters. Models of the ''Venture'', railway cars, and war planes were built.<ref>Morton 36\u20138</ref>\n\n===Special effects===\n{{more citations needed section|date=November 2016}}\n[[File:King Kong vs Tyrannosaurus.jpg|thumb|Promotional image featuring Kong battling and killing the ''Tyrannosaurus''.]]\n''King Kong'' is well known for its groundbreaking use of special effects, such as [[Stop motion|stop-motion animation]], [[matte painting]], [[rear projection]] and [[miniature effect|miniatures]], all of which were conceived decades before the digital age.<ref>Wasko, Janet. (2003). ''How Hollywood Works''. California: SAGE Publications Ltd. p.53.</ref>\n\nThe numerous prehistoric creatures inhabiting [[Skull Island]] were brought to life through the use of stop-motion animation by Willis O'Brien and his assistant animator, Buzz Gibson.<ref>Bordwell, David, Thompson, Kristin, Smith, Jeff. (2017). ''Film Art: An Introduction.'' New York: McGraw-Hill. p.388.</ref> The stop-motion animation scenes were painstaking and difficult to achieve and complete after the special effects crew realized that they could not stop, because it would make the movements of the creatures seem inconsistent and the lighting would not have the same intensity over the many days it took to fully animate a finished sequence. A device called the surface gauge was used in order to keep track of the stop-motion animation performance. The iconic fight between Kong and the ''Tyrannosaurus'' took seven weeks to be completed. O'Brien's proteg\u00e9, [[Ray Harryhausen]], who later worked with him on several films, stated that O'Brien's second wife noticed that there was so much of her husband in Kong.\n\nThe backdrop of Skull Island seen when the Venture crew first arrive was painted on glass by matte painters Henry Hillinck, Mario Larrinaga and Byron C. Crabb\u00e9. The scene was then composted with separate bird elements and rear projected behind the ship and the actors. The background of the scenes in the jungle (a miniature set) were also painted on several layers of glass to convey the illusion of deep and dense jungle foliage.<ref>Harryhausen, Ray. (1983). 'Animating the Ape'. In: Lloyd, Ann. (ed.) ''Movies of the Thirties''. UK: Orbis Publishing Ltd. p.173.</ref>\n\nThe most difficult task for the special effects crew to achieve was to make live-action footage interact with separately filmed stop-motion animation \u2013 to make the interaction between the humans and the creatures of the island seem believable. The most simple of these effects were accomplished by exposing part of the frame, then running the same piece of the film through the camera again by exposing the other part of the frame with a different image. The most complex shots, where the live-action actors interacted with the stop-motion animation, were achieved via two different techniques, the Dunning process and the Williams process, in order to produce the effect of a travelling matte.<ref>Corrigan, Timothy, White, Patricia. (2015). ''The Film Experience''. New York: Bedford/St. Martin's. pp.120\u2013121.</ref> The [[Dunning process]], invented by cinematographer Carroll H. Dunning, employed the use of blue and yellow lights that were filtered and photographed into black-and-white film. Bi-packing of the camera was used for these types of effects. With it, the special effects crew could combine two strips of different film at the same time, creating the final composite shot in the camera.<ref>Harryhausen 172\u2013173</ref> It was used in the climactic scene where one of the Curtiss Helldiver planes attacking Kong crashes from the top of the Empire State Building, and in the scene where natives are running through the foreground, while Kong is fighting other natives at the wall.\n\nOn the other hand, the Williams process, invented by cinematographer [[Frank D. Williams (cinematographer)|Frank D. Williams]], did not require a system of colored lights and could be used for wider shots. It was used in the scene where Kong is shaking the sailors off the log, as well as the scene where Kong pushes the gates open. The Williams process did not use [[bipack]]ing, but rather an [[optical printer]], the first such device that synchronized a projector with a camera, so that several strips of film could be combined into a single composited image. Through the use of the optical printer, the special effects crew could film the foreground, the stop-motion animation, the live-action footage, and the background, and combine all of those elements into one single shot, eliminating the need to create the effects in the camera.<ref>Dyson, Jeremy. (1997). ''Bright Darkness: The Lost Art of the Supernatural Horror Film.'' London: Cassell. p.38.</ref>\n\n[[File:KingKong001C.png|thumb|Colored publicity shot combining live actors interacting with stop motion animation.]] Another technique that was used in combining live actors and stop-motion animation was rear-screen projection. The actor would have a translucent screen behind him where a projector would project footage onto the back of the translucent screen.<ref name=\"Harryhausen 173\">Harryhausen 173</ref> The translucent screen was developed by Sidney Saunders and [[Fred Jackman]], who received a Special Achievement Oscar. It was used in the famous scene where Kong and the ''Tyrannosaurus'' fight while Ann watches from the branches of a nearby tree. The stop-motion animation was filmed first. Fay Wray then spent a twenty-two hour period sitting in a fake tree acting out her observation of the battle, which was projected onto the translucent screen while the camera filmed her witnessing the projected stop-motion battle. She was sore for days after the shoot. The same process was also used for the scene where sailors from the Venture kill a [[Stegosaurus]].\n\nO'Brien and his special effects crew also devised a way to use rear projection in miniature sets. A tiny screen was built into the miniature onto which live-action footage would then be projected.<ref name=\"Harryhausen 173\"/> A fan was used to prevent the footage that was projected from melting or catching fire. This miniature rear projection was used in the scene where Kong is trying to grab Driscoll, who is hiding in a cave. The scene where Kong puts Ann in the top of a tree switched from a puppet in Kong's hand to a projected footage of Ann sitting.\n\nThe scene where Kong fights the snake-like [[reptile]] in his lair was likely the most significant special effects achievement of the film, due to the way in which all of the elements in the sequence work together at the same time. The scene was accomplished through the use of a miniature set, stop-motion animation for Kong, background matte paintings, real water, foreground rocks with bubbling mud, smoke and two miniature rear screen projections of Driscoll and Ann.\n\nOver the years, some media reports have alleged that in certain scenes Kong was played by an actor wearing a [[gorilla suit]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Charlie Gemora, 58, had King Kong role|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9C07E2D71239EE32A25753C2A96E9C946091D6CF|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=20 August 1961}} {{subscription}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last1=Greene|first1=Bob|authorlink1=Bob Greene|title=Saying so long to Mr. Kong |url=http://archives.chicagotribune.com/1990/11/27/page/113/article/saying-so-long-to-mr-kong|work=[[Chicago Tribune]]|date=27 November 1990}}</ref> However, film historians have generally agreed that all scenes involving Kong were achieved with animated models.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Glut|first1=Donald F.|authorlink1=Donald F.

Some actors had so much time between their ''Kong'' periods that they were able to fully complete work on other films. Cabot completed ''Road House'' and Wray appeared in the horror films ''[[Doctor X (film)|Dr. X]]'' (1932) and ''[[Mystery of the Wax Museum]]'' (1933). She estimated she worked for ten weeks on ''Kong'' over its eight-month production.{{Citation needed|date=June 2016}}\n\nIn May and June 1932, Cooper directed the first live-action ''Kong'' scenes on the jungle set built for ''The Most Dangerous Game''. Some of these scenes were incorporated into the test reel later exhibited for the RKO board. The script was still in revision when the jungle scenes were shot and much of the dialogue was improvised. The jungle set was scheduled to be struck after ''Game'' was completed, so Cooper filmed all of the other jungle scenes at this time. The last scene shot was that of Driscoll and Ann racing through the jungle to safety following their escape from Kong's lair.{{Citation needed|date=June 2016}}\n\nIn July 1932, the native village was readied while Schoedsack and his crew filmed establishing shots in the harbor of New York City. [[Curtiss Falcon|Curtiss F8C-5/O2C-1 Helldiver]] war planes taking off and in flight were filmed at a U.S. Naval airfield on Long Island. Views of New York City were filmed from the Empire State Building for backgrounds in the final scenes and architectural plans for the mooring mast were secured from the building's owners for a mock-up to be constructed on the Hollywood sound stage.<ref>Goldner 173</ref>\n[[File:King Kong Fay Wray 1933.jpg|thumb|right|King Kong views Ann on the limb of a tree]]\nIn August 1932, the island landing party scene and the gas bomb scene were filmed south of Los Angeles on a beach at [[San Pedro, California]]. All of the native village scenes were then filmed on the [[Culver Studios|RKO-Path\u00e9 lot]] in [[Culver City]] with the native huts recycled from ''[[Bird of Paradise (1932 film)|Bird of Paradise]]'' (1932). The great wall in the island scenes was a hand-me-down from [[Cecil B. DeMille|DeMille]]'s ''[[The King of Kings (1927 film)|The King of Kings]]'' (1927) and dressed up with massive gates, a gong, and primitive carvings. The scene of Ann being led through the gates to the sacrificial altar was filmed at night with hundreds of extras and 350 lights for illumination. A camera was mounted on a crane to follow Ann to the altar. The Culver City Fire Department was on hand due to concerns that the set might go up in flames from the many native torches used in the scene. The wall and gate were destroyed in 1939 for ''[[Gone with the Wind (film)|Gone With the Wind]]''{{'}}s burning of Atlanta sequence. Hundreds of extras were once again used for Kong's rampage through the native village, and filming was completed with individual vignettes of mayhem and native panic.\n\nMeanwhile, the scene depicting a New York woman being dropped to her apparent death from a hotel window was filmed on the sound stage using the articulated hand. At the same time, a scene depicting poker players surprised by Kong's face peering through a window was filmed using the 'big head', although the scene was eventually dropped.<ref>Goldner 165</ref> When filming was completed, a break was scheduled to finish construction of the interior sets and to allow screenwriter Ruth Rose time to finish the script.\n\nIn September\u2013October 1932, Schoedsack returned to the sound stage after completing the native village shoots in Culver City. The decks and cabins of the ''Venture'' were constructed and all the live-action shipboard scenes were then filmed. The New York scenes were filmed, including the scene of Ann being plucked from the streets by Denham, and the diner scene. Following completion of the interior scenes, Schoedsack returned to San Pedro and spent a day on a tramp steamer to film the scene of Driscoll punching Ann, and various atmospheric harbor scenes. The [[Shrine Auditorium]] in Los Angeles was rented for one day to film the scenes where Kong is displayed in chains and the backstage theater scenes following his escape.<ref name=\"Goldner159\">Goldner 159</ref> Principal photography wrapped at the end of October 1932 with the filming of the climax wherein Driscoll rescues Ann at the top of the Empire State Building. Schoedsack's work was completed and he headed to Syria to film outdoor scenes for ''Arabia'', a project that was never completed.<ref>Goldner 185</ref>\n\nIn December 1932 \u2013 January 1933, the actors were called back to film a number of optical effects shots which were mostly rear-screen projections.{{Citation needed|date=June 2016}} Technical problems inherent in the process made filming difficult and time-consuming. Wray spent most of a twenty-two hour period sitting in a fake tree to witness the battle between Kong and a ''[[Tyrannosaurus]]''. She was sore for days after. Many of the scenes featuring Wray in the articulated hand were filmed at this time.{{Citation needed|date=June 2016}} In December, Cooper re-shot the scene of the female New Yorker falling to her death. Stunt doubles were filmed for the water scenes depicting Driscoll and Ann escaping from Kong. A portion of the jungle set was reconstructed to film Denham snagging his sleeve on a branch during the pursuit scene. Originally, Denham ducked behind a bush to escape danger, but this was later considered cowardly and the scene was re shot. The final scene was originally staged on the top of the Empire State Building, but Cooper was dissatisfied and re shot the scene with Kong lying dead in the street with the crowd gathered about him.{{Citation needed|date=June 2016}}\n\n===Post-production===\n[[Murray Spivack]] provided the sound effects for the film. Kong's roar was created by mixing the recorded growls of zoo [[lion]]s and [[tiger]]s, subsequently played backwards slowly. Spivak himself provided Kong's \"love grunts\" by grunting into a megaphone and playing it at a slow speed. For the huge ape's footsteps, Spivak stomped across a gravel-filled box with plungers wrapped in foam attached to his own feet, while the sounds of his chest beats were recorded by Spivak hitting his assistant (who had a microphone held to his back) on the chest with a drumstick. Spivak created the hisses and croaks of the dinosaurs with an [[air compressor]] for the former and his own vocals for the latter. The vocalizations of the Tyrannosaurus were additionally mixed in with [[cougar|puma]] screams. Bird squawks were used for the Pteranodon. Spivak also provided the numerous screams of the various sailors. Fay Wray herself provided all of her character's screams in a single recording session.<ref>Morton 75\u20136</ref><ref>Shay, Don.

Cooper thought the film deserved an original score and paid Steiner $50,000 to compose it. Steiner completed the score in six weeks and recorded it with a 46-piece orchestra. The studio later reimbursed Cooper.<ref>Morton 76\u20137</ref> The score was unlike any that came before and marked a significant change in the history of film music. ''King Kong''{{'}}s score was the first feature-length musical score written for an American \"talkie\" film, the first major Hollywood film to have a thematic score rather than background music, the first to mark the use of a 46-piece orchestra, and the first to be recorded on three separate tracks (sound effects, dialogue, and music). Steiner used a number of new film scoring techniques, such as drawing upon opera conventions for his use of [[leitmotif]]s.<ref name=\"HelveringIowa2007\">{{cite book|last1=Helvering|first1=David Allen|author2=The University of Iowa|title=Functions of dialogue underscoring in American feature film|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=X6ngAr1WLFkC&pg=PA21|accessdate=March 28, 2011|year=2007|publisher=ProQuest|isbn=978-0-549-23504-0|pages=21\u201322}}</ref> Over the years, Steiner's score was recorded by multiple record labels and the original motion picture soundtrack has been issued on a compact disc.<ref>http://www.americanmusicpreservation.com/KingKong1933.htm</ref>\n\n==Release==\n[[File:King Kong Re-release Trailer.webm|thumb|Trailer for the 1938 re-release of ''King Kong'' (1:31)]]\n[[File:Grauman's Chinese Theatre, by Carol Highsmith fixed & straightened.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Grauman's Chinese Theatre]], where ''King Kong'' held its world premiere]]\n''King Kong'' opened at the 6,200-seat [[Radio City Music Hall]] in New York City and the 3,700-seat [[Center Theatre (New York City)|RKO Roxy]] across the street on Thursday, March 2, 1933.

Plot summaries for films on Wikipedia are recommended to be between 400-700 words. All edits in this section are logged and reviewed. Please see WP:FILMPLOT for more information. Thank you. -->\n\nIn [[New York Harbor]], filmmaker [[Carl Denham]], known for wildlife films in remote and exotic locations, charters Captain Englehorn's ship, the ''Venture'', for his new project. However, he is unable to secure an actress for a female role he has been reluctant to disclose. Searching in the streets of [[New York City]], he finds Ann Darrow and promises her the adventure of a lifetime. The crew boards the ''Venture'' and sets off, during which the ship's first mate [[Jack Driscoll|Jack Driscoll]], falls in love with Ann.\n\nDenham reveals to the crew that their destination is in fact [[Skull Island]], an uncharted territory. He alludes to a monstrous creature named ''Kong'', rumored to dwell on the island. The crew arrives and anchor offshore. They encounter a native village, separated from the rest of the island by an ancient stone wall. They witness a group of natives preparing to sacrifice a young woman termed the \"bride of Kong\". The intruders are spotted and the native chief stops the ceremony. When he sees Ann, he offers to trade six of his tribal women for the \"golden woman\". They rebuff him and return to the ''Venture''.\n\nThat night, the natives kidnap Ann from the ship and take her through the wall gate and to an altar, where she is offered to [[King Kong]], an enormous [[gorilla]]-like creature. Kong carries a terrified Ann into the wilderness as Denham, Jack and some volunteers enter the jungle in hopes of rescuing her. They are ambushed by another giant creature, a ''[[Stegosaurus]]'', which they manage to defeat. After facing a ''[[Brontosaurus]]'' and Kong himself, Jack and Denham are the only survivors.\n\nA ''[[Tyrannosaurus|Tyrannosaurus rex]]'' attacks Ann and Kong, but he kills it in the battle. Meanwhile, Jack continues to follow them, while Denham returns to the village for more men. Upon arriving in Kong's lair, Ann is menaced by a snake-like ''[[Elasmosaurus]]'', which Kong also kills. While Kong is distracted killing a ''[[Pteranodon]]'' that tried to fly away with Ann, Jack reaches her and they climb down a vine dangling from a cliff ledge. When Kong notices and starts pulling them back up, the two fall unharmed. They run through the jungle and back to the village, where Denham, Englehorn, and the surviving crewmen are waiting. Kong, following, breaks open the gate and relentlessly rampages through the village. Onshore, Denham, now determined to bring Kong back alive, knocks him unconscious with a gas bomb.\n\nShackled in chains, Kong is taken to New York City and presented to a Broadway theatre audience as \"King Kong, the Eighth Wonder of the World\". Ann and Jack are brought on stage to join him, surrounded by a group of press photographers. Kong, believing that the ensuing flash photography is an attack, breaks loose. The audience flees in horror. Ann is whisked away to a hotel room on a high floor, but Kong, scaling the building, soon finds her. His hand smashes through the hotel room window, shoves Jack aside, and abducts Ann again. Kong rampages through the city as Ann screams in his grip. He wrecks a crowded elevated train and then climbs the [[Empire State Building]]. At its top, he is attacked by four airplanes. Kong destroys one, but finally succumbs to their gunfire. He gazes sorrowfully at Ann one last time before falling to his death. Jack takes an elevator to the top of the building and reunites with Ann. Denham arrives and pushes through a crowd surrounding Kong's corpse in the street. When a policeman remarks that the planes got him, Denham tells him, \"No, it wasn't the airplanes. It was Beauty  killed the Beast\".\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Fay Wray]] as Ann Darrow\n* [[Robert Armstrong (actor)|Robert Armstrong]] as [[Carl Denham]]\n* [[Bruce Cabot]] as [[Jack Driscoll|John \u201cJack\u201d Driscoll]]\n* [[Frank Reicher]] as Captain Englehorn\n* [[Sam Hardy (actor)|Sam Hardy]] as Charles Weston\n* [[Noble Johnson]] as the Native Chief\n* [[Steve Clemente]] as the Witch King\n* [[James Flavin]] as Briggs, 2nd Mate\n* [[Victor Wong (actor born 1906)|Victor Wong]] as Charlie the Cook (uncredited)\n* [[Everett Brown]] as the Native in [[Ape]] Costume (uncredited)\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Background==\n[[File:King Kong (1933), Brontosaur.jpeg|thumb|An articulated skeleton of the ''[[Brontosaurus]]'' used in the film.]]\nBefore ''King Kong'' entered production, a long tradition of jungle films existed, and, whether drama or documentary, such films (for example ''[[Stark Mad]]'') generally adhered to a narrative pattern that followed an explorer or scientist into the jungle to test a theory only to discover some monstrous aberration in the undergrowth. In these films, scientific knowledge could be subverted at any time, and it was this that provided the genre with its vitality, appeal, and endurance.<ref name=\"Peary\">Peary</ref>\n\nIn the early 20th century, few zoos had [[primate]] exhibits so there was popular demand to see them on film. At the turn of the 20th century, the [[Lumi\u00e8re Brothers]] sent film documentarians to places westerners had never seen, and [[Georges M\u00e9li\u00e8s]] utilized [[trick photography]] in film fantasies that prefigured that in ''King Kong''. Jungle films were launched in the United States with ''Beasts in the Jungle'' (1913), and the film's popularity spawned similar pictures such as ''[[Tarzan of the Apes (1918 film)|Tarzan of the Apes]]'' (1918).<ref name=\"Peary\"/> ''[[The Lost World (1925 film)|The Lost World]]'' (1925), made movie history with special effects by [[Willis O'Brien]] and a crew that later would work on ''King Kong''.<ref>Morton 21</ref> ''King Kong'' producer [[Ernest B. Schoedsack]] had earlier [[monkey]] experience directing ''[[Chang: A Drama of the Wilderness]]'' (1927), also with [[Merian C. Cooper]], and ''[[Rango (1931 film)|Rango]]'' (1931), both of which prominently featured monkeys in authentic jungle settings. Capitalizing on this trend, Congo Pictures released the [[Mockumentary|hoax documentary]] ''[[Ingagi]]'' (1930), advertising the film as \"an authentic incontestable celluloid document showing the sacrifice of a living woman to mammoth gorillas.\" ''Ingagi'' is now often recognized as a racial [[exploitation film]] as it implicitly depicted black women having sex with gorillas, and baby offspring that looked more ape than human.<ref>Gerald Peary, [http://www.geraldpeary.com/essays/jkl/kingkong-1.html 'Missing Links: The Jungle Origins of King Kong' (1976)], repr. ''Gerald Peary: Film Reviews, Interviews, Essays and Sundry Miscellany'', 2004.</ref> The film was an immediate hit, and by some estimates it was one of the highest-grossing films of the 1930s at over $4 million. Although Cooper never listed ''Ingagi'' among his influences for ''King Kong,'' it has long been held that RKO green-lit ''Kong'' because of the bottom-line example of ''Ingagi'' and the formula that \"gorillas plus sexy women in peril equals enormous profits\".<ref>{{cite news | first=Andrew | last=Erish | title=Illegitimate Dad of King Kong | date=January 8, 2006| newspaper=Los Angeles Times | url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/latimes/access/959395991.html?dids=959395991:959395991&FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT&type=current&date=Jan+8%2C+2006&author=Andrew+Erish&pub=Los+Angeles+Times&edition=&startpage=E.6&desc=Movies}}</ref>\n\n==Development==\n\n===Concept===\n<!-- This entire section has been sourced from Ray Morton's ''King Kong''.

Cooper]]'s fascination with gorillas began with his boyhood reading of [[Paul Du Chaillu]]'s ''Explorations and Adventures in Equatorial Africa'' (1861) and was furthered in 1929 by studying a tribe of [[baboon]]s in Africa while filming ''The Four Feathers''. After reading W. Douglas Burden's ''The Dragon Lizards of Komodo'', he fashioned a scenario depicting African gorillas battling [[Komodo dragon]]s intercut with artificial stand-ins for joint shots. He then narrowed the ''[[dramatis personae]]'' to one ferocious, lizard-battling gorilla (rather than a group) and included a lone woman on expedition to appease those critics who belabored him for neglecting romance in his films. A remote island would be the setting and the gorilla would be dealt a spectacular death in New York City.<ref>Morton 17\u20138</ref>\n\nCooper took his concept to [[Paramount Studios]] in the first years of the [[Great Depression in the United States|Great Depression]] but executives shied away from a project that sent film crews on costly shoots to Africa and Komodo. In 1931, [[David O. Selznick]] brought Cooper to RKO as his executive assistant and promised him he could make his own films. Cooper began immediately developing ''[[The Most Dangerous Game (film)|The Most Dangerous Game]]'', and hired [[Ernest B. Schoedsack]] to direct. A huge jungle stage set was built, with Robert Armstrong and Fay Wray as the stars. Once the film was underway, Cooper turned his attention to the studio's big-budget-out-of-control fantasy, ''[[Creation (1931 film)|Creation]]'', a project with [[stop motion]] [[animation|animator]] [[Willis O'Brien]] about a group of travelers shipwrecked on an island of [[dinosaur]]s.<ref>Morton 18\u201320</ref>\n\nWhen Cooper screened O'Brien's stop-motion ''Creation'' footage, he was unimpressed, but realized he could economically make his gorilla picture by scrapping the Komodo dragons and costly location shoots for O'Brien's animated dinosaurs and the studio's existing jungle set. It was at this time Cooper probably cast his gorilla as a giant named Kong, and planned to have him die at the [[Empire State Building]]. The RKO board was wary about the project, but gave its approval after Cooper organized a presentation with Wray, Armstrong, and Cabot, and O'Brien's model dinosaurs. In his executive capacity, Cooper ordered the ''Creation'' production shelved, and put its crew to work on ''Kong''.<ref>Morton 22\u20135</ref>\n<!-- This entire section has been sourced from Ray Morton's ''King Kong''.

Cooper understood the commercial appeal of Wallace's work and planned to publicize the film as being \"based on the novel by Edgar Wallace\". Wallace conferred with Cooper and O'Brien (who contributed, among other things, the \"Ann's dress\" scene) and began work on January 1, 1932. He completed a rough draft called ''The Beast'' on January 5, 1932. Cooper thought the draft needed considerable work but Wallace died on February 10, 1932, just after beginning revisions.<ref name=\"Peary\"/><ref name=\"Morton25-7\">Morton, p. 25\u20137</ref> Despite not using any of the draft in the final production beyond the previously agreed upon plot outline, Cooper gave a screen credit to Wallace as he had promised it as a producer.\n\nCooper called in [[James Ashmore Creelman]] (who was working on the script of ''[[The Most Dangerous Game (film)|The Most Dangerous Game]]'' at the time) and the two men worked together on several drafts under the title ''The Eighth Wonder''. Some details from Wallace's rough draft were dropped, such as his boatload of escaped convicts. Wallace's Danby Denham character, a big game hunter, became film director Carl Denham. His Shirley became Ann Darrow and her lover-convict John became Jack Driscoll. The \u201cbeauty and the beast\u201d angle was first developed at this time. Kong's escape was switched from [[Madison Square Garden]] to [[Yankee Stadium]] and (finally) to a Broadway theater. Cute moments involving the gorilla in Wallace's draft were cut because Cooper wanted Kong hard and tough in the belief that his fall would be all the more awesome and tragic.<ref name=\"Morton25-7\"/>\n\nTime constraints forced Creelman to temporarily drop ''The Eighth Wonder'' and devote his time to the ''Game'' script. RKO staff writer [[Horace McCoy]] was called in to work with Cooper, and it was he who introduced the island natives, a giant wall, and the sacrificial maidens into the plot. [[Leon Gordon (playwright)|Leon Gordon]] also contributed to the screenplay in a minimal capacity; both he and McCoy went uncredited in the completed film.<ref name=\"erb31\">Erb, p. 31</ref> When Creelman returned to the script full-time, he hated McCoy's \u201cmythic elements\u201d, believing the script already had too many over-the-top concepts, but Cooper insisted on keeping them in. RKO head Selznick and his executives wanted Kong introduced earlier in the film (believing the audience would grow bored waiting for his appearance), but Cooper persuaded them that a suspenseful build-up would make Kong's entrance all the more exciting.<ref name=\"Morton28\">Morton, p. 28</ref>\n\nCooper felt Creelman's final draft was slow-paced, too full of flowery dialogue, weighted-down with long scenes of exposition,<ref name=\"Morton28\"/> and written on a scale that would have been prohibitively expensive to film.<ref name=\"Goldner page unknown\">Goldner (page unknown)</ref> Writer [[Ruth Rose]] (Schoedsack's wife) was brought in to for rewrites and, although she had never written a screenplay, undertook the task with a complete understanding of Cooper's style, streamlining the script and tightening the action. Rather than explaining how Kong would be transported to New York, for example, she simply cut from the island to the theater. She incorporated autobiographical elements into the script with Cooper mirrored in the Denham character, her husband Schoedsack in the tough but tender Driscoll character, and herself in struggling actress Ann Darrow. Rose also rewrote the dialogue and created the film's opening sequence, showing Denham meeting Ann on the streets of New York. Cooper was delighted with Rose's script, approving the newly re-titled ''Kong'' for production.<ref>Morton, p. 28\u20139</ref> Cooper and Schoedsack decided to co-direct scenes but their styles were different (Cooper was slow and meticulous, Schoedsack brisk) and they finally agreed to work separately, with Cooper overseeing O'Brien's miniature work and directing the special effects sequences, and Schoedsack directing the dialogue scenes.<ref>Morton, p. 29</ref>\n<!-- This entire section has been principally sourced from Ray Morton's ''King Kong''.

She met ''Kong'' co-directors Cooper and Schoedsack when cast as Ethne Eustace in ''[[The Four Feathers (1929 film)|The Four Feathers]]'' (1929). Cooper cast her as Eve Trowbridge in ''[[The Most Dangerous Game (film)|The Most Dangerous Game]]'' (1932).<ref name=\"Morton31-3\">Morton 31\u20133</ref> After the RKO board approved the ''Kong'' test, Cooper decided a blonde would provide contrast to the gorilla's dark pelt. [[Dorothy Jordan (film actress)|Dorothy Jordan]], [[Jean Harlow]], and [[Ginger Rogers]] were considered, but the role finally went to Wray who wore a blonde wig in the film and was inspired more by Cooper's enthusiasm than the script to accept the role. According to her autobiography, ''On the Other Hand'', Wray recounts that Cooper had told her he planned to star her opposite the \"tallest, darkest leading man in Hollywood\". She assumed he meant [[Clark Gable]] until he showed her a picture of Kong climbing the Empire State Building.<ref name=\"Morton31-3\"/> On the film's 50th anniversary in 1983, one New York theater held a Fay Wray scream-alike contest in its lobby,<ref name=\"erb31\" /> and on August 10, 2004, two days after Wray died, the lights of the [[Empire State Building]] were dimmed for 15 minutes in her memory.<ref>United Press International</ref>\n* [[Robert Armstrong (actor)|Robert Armstrong]]\n[[File:Robert Armstrong.JPG|right|thumb|Armstrong featured in [[Trailer (promotion)|trailer]] for later film, ''[[The Ex-Mrs. Bradford]]'' (1936)]]\n:[[Michigan]] native and veteran [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] and [[silent film]] character actor [[Robert Armstrong (actor)|Robert Armstrong]] played Wray's alcoholic brother in ''The Most Dangerous Game'' and, during filming, became a member of the Cooper-Schoedsack inner circle.

Retrieved 1st February 2017</ref>\n\nKong's torso was streamlined to eliminate the comical appearance of the real world gorilla's prominent belly and buttocks. His lips, eyebrows, and nose were fashioned of rubber, his eyes of glass, and his facial expressions controlled by thin, bendable wires threaded through holes drilled in his aluminum skull. During filming, Kong's rubber skin dried out quickly under studio lights, making it necessary to replace it often and completely rebuild his facial features.<ref>Morton 33\u20135</ref>\n[[Image:Img kingkong1.jpg|thumb|right|The [[stop-motion]] animated King Kong atop the [[Empire State Building]] and battling a [[Curtiss F8C Helldiver]] airplane]]\nA huge bust of Kong's head, neck, and upper chest was made of wood, cloth, rubber, and bearskin by Delgado, E.

Its fangs were 10 inches in length and its eyeballs 12 inches in diameter. The bust was moved from set to set on a flatcar. Its scale matched none of the models and, if fully realized, Kong would have stood thirty to forty feet tall.<ref>Morton 35\u20136</ref>\n\nTwo versions of Kong's right hand and arm were constructed of steel, sponge rubber, rubber, and bearskin.{{Citation needed|date=June 2016}} The first hand was non articulated, mounted on a crane, and operated by grips for the scene in which Kong grabs at Driscoll in the cave. The other hand and arm had articulated fingers, was mounted on a lever to elevate it, and was used in the several scenes in which Kong grasps Ann. A non articulated leg was created of materials similar to the hands, mounted on a crane, and used to stomp on Kong's victims.<ref>Morton 36</ref>\n[[File:T. rex old posture.jpg|left|thumb|[[Charles R.

Knight]]'s murals in the [[American Museum of Natural History]] in New York City. All the armatures were manufactured in the RKO machine shop. Materials used were cotton, foam rubber, latex sheeting, and liquid latex. Football bladders were placed inside some models to simulate breathing.{{Citation needed|date=June 2016}} A scale of one-inch-equals-one-foot was employed and models ranged from 18 inches to 3 feet in length. Several of the models were originally built for ''Creation'' and sometimes two or three models were built of individual species. Prolonged exposure to studio lights wreaked havoc with the latex skin so John Cerasoli carved wooden duplicates of each model to be used as stand-ins for test shoots and lineups. He carved wooden models of Ann, Driscoll, and other human characters. Models of the ''Venture'', railway cars, and war planes were built.<ref>Morton 36\u20138</ref>\n\n===Special effects===\n{{more citations needed section|date=November 2016}}\n[[File:King Kong vs Tyrannosaurus.jpg|thumb|Promotional image featuring Kong battling and killing the ''Tyrannosaurus''.]]\n''King Kong'' is well known for its groundbreaking use of special effects, such as [[Stop motion|stop-motion animation]], [[matte painting]], [[rear projection]] and [[miniature effect|miniatures]], all of which were conceived decades before the digital age.<ref>Wasko, Janet. (2003). ''How Hollywood Works''. California: SAGE Publications Ltd. p.53.</ref>\n\nThe numerous prehistoric creatures inhabiting [[Skull Island]] were brought to life through the use of stop-motion animation by Willis O'Brien and his assistant animator, Buzz Gibson.<ref>Bordwell, David, Thompson, Kristin, Smith, Jeff. (2017). ''Film Art: An Introduction.'' New York: McGraw-Hill. p.388.</ref> The stop-motion animation scenes were painstaking and difficult to achieve and complete after the special effects crew realized that they could not stop, because it would make the movements of the creatures seem inconsistent and the lighting would not have the same intensity over the many days it took to fully animate a finished sequence. A device called the surface gauge was used in order to keep track of the stop-motion animation performance. The iconic fight between Kong and the ''Tyrannosaurus'' took seven weeks to be completed. O'Brien's proteg\u00e9, [[Ray Harryhausen]], who later worked with him on several films, stated that O'Brien's second wife noticed that there was so much of her husband in Kong.\n\nThe backdrop of Skull Island seen when the Venture crew first arrive was painted on glass by matte painters Henry Hillinck, Mario Larrinaga and Byron C. Crabb\u00e9. The scene was then composted with separate bird elements and rear projected behind the ship and the actors. The background of the scenes in the jungle (a miniature set) were also painted on several layers of glass to convey the illusion of deep and dense jungle foliage.<ref>Harryhausen, Ray. (1983). 'Animating the Ape'. In: Lloyd, Ann. (ed.) ''Movies of the Thirties''. UK: Orbis Publishing Ltd. p.173.</ref>\n\nThe most difficult task for the special effects crew to achieve was to make live-action footage interact with separately filmed stop-motion animation \u2013 to make the interaction between the humans and the creatures of the island seem believable. The most simple of these effects were accomplished by exposing part of the frame, then running the same piece of the film through the camera again by exposing the other part of the frame with a different image. The most complex shots, where the live-action actors interacted with the stop-motion animation, were achieved via two different techniques, the Dunning process and the Williams process, in order to produce the effect of a travelling matte.<ref>Corrigan, Timothy, White, Patricia. (2015). ''The Film Experience''. New York: Bedford/St. Martin's. pp.120\u2013121.</ref> The [[Dunning process]], invented by cinematographer Carroll H. Dunning, employed the use of blue and yellow lights that were filtered and photographed into black-and-white film. Bi-packing of the camera was used for these types of effects. With it, the special effects crew could combine two strips of different film at the same time, creating the final composite shot in the camera.<ref>Harryhausen 172\u2013173</ref> It was used in the climactic scene where one of the Curtiss Helldiver planes attacking Kong crashes from the top of the Empire State Building, and in the scene where natives are running through the foreground, while Kong is fighting other natives at the wall.\n\nOn the other hand, the Williams process, invented by cinematographer [[Frank D. Williams (cinematographer)|Frank D. Williams]], did not require a system of colored lights and could be used for wider shots. It was used in the scene where Kong is shaking the sailors off the log, as well as the scene where Kong pushes the gates open. The Williams process did not use [[bipack]]ing, but rather an [[optical printer]], the first such device that synchronized a projector with a camera, so that several strips of film could be combined into a single composited image. Through the use of the optical printer, the special effects crew could film the foreground, the stop-motion animation, the live-action footage, and the background, and combine all of those elements into one single shot, eliminating the need to create the effects in the camera.<ref>Dyson, Jeremy. (1997). ''Bright Darkness: The Lost Art of the Supernatural Horror Film.'' London: Cassell. p.38.</ref>\n\nAnother technique that was used in combining live actors and stop-motion animation was rear-screen projection. The actor would have a translucent screen behind him where a projector would project footage onto the back of the translucent screen.<ref name=\"Harryhausen 173\">Harryhausen 173</ref> The translucent screen was developed by Sidney Saunders and [[Fred Jackman]], who received a Special Achievement Oscar. It was used in the famous scene where Kong and the ''Tyrannosaurus'' fight while Ann watches from the branches of a nearby tree. The stop-motion animation was filmed first. Fay Wray then spent a twenty-two hour period sitting in a fake tree acting out her observation of the battle, which was projected onto the translucent screen while the camera filmed her witnessing the projected stop-motion battle. She was sore for days after the shoot. The same process was also used for the scene where sailors from the Venture kill a [[Stegosaurus]].\n\nO'Brien and his special effects crew also devised a way to use rear projection in miniature sets. A tiny screen was built into the miniature onto which live-action footage would then be projected.<ref name=\"Harryhausen 173\"/> A fan was used to prevent the footage that was projected from melting or catching fire. This miniature rear projection was used in the scene where Kong is trying to grab Driscoll, who is hiding in a cave. The scene where Kong puts Ann in the top of a tree switched from a puppet in Kong's hand to a projected footage of Ann sitting.\n\nThe scene where Kong fights the snake-like [[reptile]] in his lair was likely the most significant special effects achievement of the film, due to the way in which all of the elements in the sequence work together at the same time. The scene was accomplished through the use of a miniature set, stop-motion animation for Kong, background matte paintings, real water, foreground rocks with bubbling mud, smoke and two miniature rear screen projections of Driscoll and Ann.\n\nOver the years, some media reports have alleged that in certain scenes Kong was played by an actor wearing a [[gorilla suit]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Charlie Gemora, 58, had King Kong role|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9C07E2D71239EE32A25753C2A96E9C946091D6CF|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=20 August 1961}} {{subscription}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last1=Greene|first1=Bob|authorlink1=Bob Greene|title=Saying so long to Mr. Kong |url=http://archives.chicagotribune.com/1990/11/27/page/113/article/saying-so-long-to-mr-kong|work=[[Chicago Tribune]]|date=27 November 1990}}</ref> However, film historians have generally agreed that all scenes involving Kong were achieved with animated models.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Glut|first1=Donald F.|authorlink1=Donald F.

Some actors had so much time between their ''Kong'' periods that they were able to fully complete work on other films. Cabot completed ''Road House'' and Wray appeared in the horror films ''[[Doctor X (film)|Dr. X]]'' (1932) and ''[[Mystery of the Wax Museum]]'' (1933). She estimated she worked for ten weeks on ''Kong'' over its eight-month production.{{Citation needed|date=June 2016}}\n\nIn May and June 1932, Cooper directed the first live-action ''Kong'' scenes on the jungle set built for ''The Most Dangerous Game''. Some of these scenes were incorporated into the test reel later exhibited for the RKO board. The script was still in revision when the jungle scenes were shot and much of the dialogue was improvised. The jungle set was scheduled to be struck after ''Game'' was completed, so Cooper filmed all of the other jungle scenes at this time. The last scene shot was that of Driscoll and Ann racing through the jungle to safety following their escape from Kong's lair.{{Citation needed|date=June 2016}}\n\nIn July 1932, the native village was readied while Schoedsack and his crew filmed establishing shots in the harbor of New York City. [[Curtiss Falcon|Curtiss F8C-5/O2C-1 Helldiver]] war planes taking off and in flight were filmed at a U.S. Naval airfield on Long Island. Views of New York City were filmed from the Empire State Building for backgrounds in the final scenes and architectural plans for the mooring mast were secured from the building's owners for a mock-up to be constructed on the Hollywood sound stage.<ref>Goldner 173</ref>\n[[File:King Kong Fay Wray 1933.jpg|thumb|right|King Kong views Ann on the limb of a tree]]\nIn August 1932, the island landing party scene and the gas bomb scene were filmed south of Los Angeles on a beach at [[San Pedro, California]]. All of the native village scenes were then filmed on the [[Culver Studios|RKO-Path\u00e9 lot]] in [[Culver City]] with the native huts recycled from ''[[Bird of Paradise (1932 film)|Bird of Paradise]]'' (1932). The great wall in the island scenes was a hand-me-down from [[Cecil B. DeMille|DeMille]]'s ''[[The King of Kings (1927 film)|The King of Kings]]'' (1927) and dressed up with massive gates, a gong, and primitive carvings. The scene of Ann being led through the gates to the sacrificial altar was filmed at night with hundreds of extras and 350 lights for illumination. A camera was mounted on a crane to follow Ann to the altar. The Culver City Fire Department was on hand due to concerns that the set might go up in flames from the many native torches used in the scene. The wall and gate were destroyed in 1939 for ''[[Gone with the Wind (film)|Gone With the Wind]]''{{'}}s burning of Atlanta sequence. Hundreds of extras were once again used for Kong's rampage through the native village, and filming was completed with individual vignettes of mayhem and native panic.\n\nMeanwhile, the scene depicting a New York woman being dropped to her apparent death from a hotel window was filmed on the sound stage using the articulated hand. At the same time, a scene depicting poker players surprised by Kong's face peering through a window was filmed using the 'big head', although the scene was eventually dropped.<ref>Goldner 165</ref> When filming was completed, a break was scheduled to finish construction of the interior sets and to allow screenwriter Ruth Rose time to finish the script.\n\nIn September\u2013October 1932, Schoedsack returned to the sound stage after completing the native village shoots in Culver City. The decks and cabins of the ''Venture'' were constructed and all the live-action shipboard scenes were then filmed. The New York scenes were filmed, including the scene of Ann being plucked from the streets by Denham, and the diner scene. Following completion of the interior scenes, Schoedsack returned to San Pedro and spent a day on a tramp steamer to film the scene of Driscoll punching Ann, and various atmospheric harbor scenes. The [[Shrine Auditorium]] in Los Angeles was rented for one day to film the scenes where Kong is displayed in chains and the backstage theater scenes following his escape.<ref name=\"Goldner159\">Goldner 159</ref> Principal photography wrapped at the end of October 1932 with the filming of the climax wherein Driscoll rescues Ann at the top of the Empire State Building. Schoedsack's work was completed and he headed to Syria to film outdoor scenes for ''Arabia'', a project that was never completed.<ref>Goldner 185</ref>\n\nIn December 1932 \u2013 January 1933, the actors were called back to film a number of optical effects shots which were mostly rear-screen projections.{{Citation needed|date=June 2016}} Technical problems inherent in the process made filming difficult and time-consuming. Wray spent most of a twenty-two hour period sitting in a fake tree to witness the battle between Kong and a ''[[Tyrannosaurus]]''. She was sore for days after. Many of the scenes featuring Wray in the articulated hand were filmed at this time.{{Citation needed|date=June 2016}} In December, Cooper re-shot the scene of the female New Yorker falling to her death. Stunt doubles were filmed for the water scenes depicting Driscoll and Ann escaping from Kong. A portion of the jungle set was reconstructed to film Denham snagging his sleeve on a branch during the pursuit scene. Originally, Denham ducked behind a bush to escape danger, but this was later considered cowardly and the scene was re shot. The final scene was originally staged on the top of the Empire State Building, but Cooper was dissatisfied and re shot the scene with Kong lying dead in the street with the crowd gathered about him.{{Citation needed|date=June 2016}}\n\n===Post-production===\n[[Murray Spivack]] provided the sound effects for the film. Kong's roar was created by mixing the recorded growls of zoo [[lion]]s and [[tiger]]s, subsequently played backwards slowly. Spivak himself provided Kong's \"love grunts\" by grunting into a megaphone and playing it at a slow speed. For the huge ape's footsteps, Spivak stomped across a gravel-filled box with plungers wrapped in foam attached to his own feet, while the sounds of his chest beats were recorded by Spivak hitting his assistant (who had a microphone held to his back) on the chest with a drumstick. Spivak created the hisses and croaks of the dinosaurs with an [[air compressor]] for the former and his own vocals for the latter. The vocalizations of the Tyrannosaurus were additionally mixed in with [[cougar|puma]] screams. Bird squawks were used for the Pteranodon. Spivak also provided the numerous screams of the various sailors. Fay Wray herself provided all of her character's screams in a single recording session.<ref>Morton 75\u20136</ref><ref>Shay, Don. (1982) ''Cinefex'' issues 7\u201310 page 41</ref>\n\nFor budgetary reasons, RKO decided not to have an original film score composed, instead instructing composer [[Max Steiner]] to simply reuse music from other films. Cooper thought the film deserved an original score and paid Steiner $50,000 to compose it. Steiner completed the score in six weeks and recorded it with a 46-piece orchestra. The studio later reimbursed Cooper.<ref>Morton 76\u20137</ref> The score was unlike any that came before and marked a significant change in the history of film music. ''King Kong''{{'}}s score was the first feature-length musical score written for an American \"talkie\" film, the first major Hollywood film to have a thematic score rather than background music, the first to mark the use of a 46-piece orchestra, and the first to be recorded on three separate tracks (sound effects, dialogue, and music). Steiner used a number of new film scoring techniques, such as drawing upon opera conventions for his use of [[leitmotif]]s.<ref name=\"HelveringIowa2007\">{{cite book|last1=Helvering|first1=David Allen|author2=The University of Iowa|title=Functions of dialogue underscoring in American feature film|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=X6ngAr1WLFkC&pg=PA21|accessdate=March 28, 2011|year=2007|publisher=ProQuest|isbn=978-0-549-23504-0|pages=21\u201322}}</ref> Over the years, Steiner's score was recorded by multiple record labels and the original motion picture soundtrack has been issued on a compact disc.<ref>http://www.americanmusicpreservation.com/KingKong1933.htm</ref>\n\n==Release==\n[[File:King Kong Re-release Trailer.webm|thumb|Trailer for the 1938 re-release of ''King Kong'' (1:31)]]\n[[File:Grauman's Chinese Theatre, by Carol Highsmith fixed & straightened.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Grauman's Chinese Theatre]], where ''King Kong'' held its world premiere]]\n''King Kong'' opened at the 6,200-seat [[Radio City Music Hall]] in New York City and the 3,700-seat [[Center Theatre (New York City)|RKO Roxy]] across the street on Thursday, March 2, 1933.

(2012). The Classical Hollywood Reader. London: Routledge. P.351.</ref> The [[Motion Picture Production Code|Production Code]]'s stricter decency rules had been put into effect in Hollywood after its 1933 premiere and it was progressively censored further, with several scenes being either trimmed or excised altogether.\n\nThese scenes were as follows:<ref name=\"Morton83-4\">Morton 83\u20134</ref>\n*A ''Brontosaurus'' mauling crewmen in the water, chasing one up a tree and killing him;\n*Kong undressing Ann Darrow and sniffing his fingers;\n*Kong biting and stepping on natives when he attacks the village;\n*Kong biting a reporter in New York;\n*Kong mistaking a sleeping woman for Ann and dropping her to her death, after realizing his mistake.\n*An additional scene portraying giant insects, spiders, a lizard and a tentacled creature devouring the crew members shaken off the log by Kong into the floor of the canyon below was deemed too gruesome by RKO even by pre-Code standards, and thus the scene was studio self-censored prior to original release. Though searched for, the footage is now considered \"lost forever\" with only a few stills and pre-production drawings <ref>{{cite web |last1=Wednesday |first1=WTM \u2022 |title=The Lost Scene from 1933's King Kong - the Spider Pit |url=https://www.neatorama.com/2018/12/12/The-Lost-Scene-from-1933-s-King-Kong-the-Spider-Pit/ |website=Neatorama |accessdate=28 January 2020 |language=en}}</ref>\n\nAfter the 1956 re-release, the film was sold to television (first being broadcast March 5, 1956).<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Rainho|first1=Manny|title=This Month in Movie History|journal=Classic Images|date=March 2015|issue=477|page=26}}</ref>\n\nRKO did not preserve copies of film's negative or release prints with the excised footage, and the cut scenes were considered lost for many years. In 1969, a 16mm print, including the censored footage, was found in Philadelphia. The cut scenes were added to the film, restoring it to its original theatrical running time of 100 minutes. This version was re-released to [[art house]]s by [[Janus Films]] in 1970.<ref name=\"Morton83-4\"/>\n\nOver the next two decades, [[Universal Studios]] carried out further photochemical restoration on ''King Kong''.

Those included a [[Turner Home Entertainment|Turner]] 60th anniversary edition in 1993 featuring a front cover which had the sound effect of Kong roaring when his chest was pressed. It also included the colorized version of the film and a 25-minute documentary, ''It Was Beauty Killed the Beast'' (1992).

It had numerous extra features, including a new, third audio commentary by [[visual effects]] artists [[Ray Harryhausen]] and [[Ken Ralston]], with archival excerpts from actress [[Fay Wray]] and producer/director [[Merian C.

The Blu-Ray contained the same contents as the  US release, but unfortunately for the DVD, that was based on the first Disc of the 2-Disc DVD release.\n\n==Adaptations==\nThe 1933 ''King Kong'' film and character inspired imitations and installments. ''[[Son of Kong]]'', a direct sequel to the 1933 film was released nine months after the first film's release. In the early 1960s, RKO had licensed the King Kong character to Japanese studio [[Toho]] and produced two King Kong films, ''[[King Kong vs. Godzilla]]'' (a crossover with the [[Godzilla (franchise)|''Godzilla'' series]]) and ''[[King Kong Escapes]]'', both directed by [[Ishir\u014d Honda]].\n\nIn 1976, Italian producer [[Dino De Laurentiis]] released his version of [[King Kong (1976 film)|''King Kong'']], a modern remake of the 1933 film, which was followed by a sequel in 1986 titled ''[[King Kong Lives]]''. In 2005, [[Universal Pictures]] released another remake of [[King Kong (2005 film)|''King Kong'']], directed by [[Peter Jackson]]. [[Legendary Pictures]] and [[Warner Bros.]] released a Kong reboot film titled ''[[Kong: Skull Island]]'' in 2017 which was directed by [[Jordan Vogt-Roberts]] and is the second installment of a shared universe called the [[MonsterVerse]], which started with Legendary's reboot of '' [[Godzilla (2014 film)|Godzilla]]''.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Film|Speculative fiction/Horror|United States}}\n* [[List of films featuring giant monsters]]\n* [[List of stop motion films]]\n* [[1933 in film]]\n* [[List of highest-grossing films]]\n* [[Skull Island]]\n* ''[[Mighty Joe Young (1949 film)|Mighty Joe Young]]'' (1949)\n* ''[[The Lost World (1925 film)|The Lost World]]'' (1925)\n* ''[[Ingagi]]'' (1930)\n* ''[[Stark Mad]]'' (1929)\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n===Bibliography===\n*{{cite web |author=American Film Institute |author-link=American Film Institute |date=June 17, 2008 |title=AFI Crowns Top 10 Films in 10 Classic Genres |url = https://www.comingsoon.net/news/movienews.php?id=46072 |accessdate=February 20, 2010}}\n*Annette, Kuhn.
