Several complaints have been made against him to the [[Canadian Broadcast Standards Council]] (CBSC). In a 1994 complaint to the CBSC, listeners alleged that Green had been rude and abusive to a caller who identified herself as a Christian. Although the CBSC determined that Green's conduct had contravened its guidelines on discrimination, it also decided that the station had responded appropriately, and the group did not prescribe any further action. In 2006 and 2008, the council censured Green for his treatment of a Muslim man who challenged Green on the way the radio show host portrays Islam.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cbsc.ca/english/decisions/2009/090206a.php|title=Archived copy|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101121203806/http://www.cbsc.ca/english/decisions/2009/090206a.php|archivedate=21 November 2010|accessdate=2010-11-30|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cbsc.ca/english/decisions/2006/061215.php|title=Archived copy|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111008202250/http://www.cbsc.ca/english/decisions/2006/061215.php|archivedate=8 October 2011|accessdate=2009-08-07|df=dmy-all}}</ref>  In June 2017, there was controversy as to whether [[Indigo Books and Music]] had pulled Green's latest book, ''Amazing But True!'', from its bookshelves in stores in Canada.<ref>{{cite news|last=Johnston|first=Geoffrey|url=http://www.thewhig.com/2017/06/01/author-battles-censorship|title=Author battles 'censorship'|date=1 June 2017|newspaper=The Kingston Whig-Standard|accessdate=12 July 2017}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[https://www.facebook.com/lgreen.ca/ Lowell Green at Facebook]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20090212100107/http://cbsc.ca/english/decisions/1994/940604.php 1994 decision]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20111008202250/http://www.cbsc.ca/english/decisions/2006/061215.php 2006 decision]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20101121203806/http://www.cbsc.ca/english/decisions/2009/090206a.php 2009 decision]\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Green, Lowell}}\n[[Category:1936 births]]\n[[Category:Canadian non-fiction writers]]\n[[Category:Canadian people of Irish descent]]\n[[Category:Canadian talk radio hosts]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:McGill University alumni]]\n[[Category:Ontario Liberal Party candidates in Ontario provincial elections]]\n[[Category:Writers from Ann Arbor, Michigan]]\n[[Category:Writers from Ottawa]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Canadian radio personality}}\n{{Use Canadian English|date=February 2013}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=July 2013}}\n{{Infobox presenter\n|name        = Lowell Green\n|alias       = \n|image       = Lowell Green.jpg|<nowiki>Lowell Green]]</nowiki>\n|image_size  = \n|caption     = \n|birth_name  = \n|birth_date  = {{Birth date and age|df=yes|1936|07|07}}\n|birth_place = [[Ann Arbor, Michigan]], [[USA]]\n|death_date  = \n|death_place = \n|show        = ''The Lowell Green Show''\n|station     = [[CFRA (AM)|CFRA]] Ottawa\n|timeslot    = Weekdays 10 am to 12pm\n|show2       = \n|station2    = \n|timeslot2   = \n|style       = [[Talk radio]]\n|country     = Canada\n|prevshow    = Greenline\n|website     = \n|spouse      = Deborah Green\n|awards      = }}\n\n'''Lowell Green''' (born 7 July 1936) is a Canadian radio personality, journalist, and author, best known as the host of ''The Lowell Green Show'', a conservative morning [[talk show]] that aired on the [[Ottawa]] [[Ontario]] radio station [[CFRA]].

Several complaints have been made against him to the [[Canadian Broadcast Standards Council]] (CBSC). In a 1994 complaint to the CBSC, listeners alleged that Green had been rude and abusive to a caller who identified herself as a Christian. Although the CBSC determined that Green's conduct had contravened its guidelines on discrimination, it also decided that the station had responded appropriately, and the group did not prescribe any further action. In 2006 and 2008, the council censured Green for his treatment of a Muslim man who challenged Green on the way the radio show host portrays Islam.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cbsc.ca/english/decisions/2009/090206a.php|title=Archived copy|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101121203806/http://www.cbsc.ca/english/decisions/2009/090206a.php|archivedate=21 November 2010|accessdate=2010-11-30|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cbsc.ca/english/decisions/2006/061215.php|title=Archived copy|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111008202250/http://www.cbsc.ca/english/decisions/2006/061215.php|archivedate=8 October 2011|accessdate=2009-08-07|df=dmy-all}}</ref>  In June 2017, there was controversy as to whether [[Indigo Books and Music]] had pulled Green's latest book, ''Amazing But True!'', from its bookshelves in stores in Canada.<ref>{{cite news|last=Johnston|first=Geoffrey|url=http://www.thewhig.com/2017/06/01/author-battles-censorship|title=Author battles 'censorship'|date=1 June 2017|newspaper=The Kingston Whig-Standard|accessdate=12 July 2017}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[https://www.facebook.com/lgreen.ca/ Lowell Green at Facebook]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20090212100107/http://cbsc.ca/english/decisions/1994/940604.php 1994 decision]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20111008202250/http://www.cbsc.ca/english/decisions/2006/061215.php 2006 decision]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20101121203806/http://www.cbsc.ca/english/decisions/2009/090206a.php 2009 decision]\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Green, Lowell}}\n[[Category:1936 births]]\n[[Category:Canadian non-fiction writers]]\n[[Category:Canadian people of Irish descent]]\n[[Category:Canadian talk radio hosts]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:McGill University alumni]]\n[[Category:Ontario Liberal Party candidates in Ontario provincial elections]]\n[[Category:Writers from Ann Arbor, Michigan]]\n[[Category:Writers from Ottawa]]\n", "name_user": "WildStar", "label": "safe", "comment": "maintenance template", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lowell_Green"}

She gained recognition in 2011 after being featured on [[Pitbull (rapper)|Pitbull]]'s hit single \"[[Give Me Everything]]\", produced by [[Afrojack]], and releasing her single \"[[Suave (Kiss Me)]]\" featuring Pitbull and Swedish-Congolese singer-songwriter [[Mohombi]] which was a success in Europe and the Middle East. Her other known collaborations include songs with [[Ne-Yo|Neyo]], [[Enrique Iglesias]], [[Lil Wayne]], [[Usher (musician)|Usher]],  [[Fonseca (singer)|Fonseca]], [[Juan Magan]], Yomil (of the Cuban duo Yomil y el Dany), [[Jean-Roch]] and [[Melissa (singer)|Melissa]].\n\n==Early life==\nNayer Regalado was born on August 2, 1989 in [[New Jersey]]. Her family moved to [[Miami]] when she was 3 months old. Her parents were born in Cuba but her mother, Maria, also has [[Lebanese people|Lebanese]] & Brazilian ancestry.\n\nNayer began a singing and acting career at the age of 7.\n\n==Career==\nNayer has appeared in numerous ads, commercials, soap operas, carnivals, foundations, charity events and TV programs. She has participated in a major talent competition named \"[[Star Search]]\" and she has also appeared in television show [[S\u00e1bado Gigante]], and in a show called ''La pi\u00f1ata loca'' (broadcast through [[Univision]]). Supported by her parents, she moved to [[Los Angeles]] when she was 14, to record a six-song demo. After shopping the demo to labels, Nayer secured a major recording deal at Miami-based and Latin music-oriented Sony Discos which was looking for a voice for a new track called \"First Kiss (Primer Beso)\". Recorded by Nayer at the age of 16, produced and remixed by DJ Fluid in both [[English language|English]] and [[Spanish language|Spanish]], \"First Kiss (Primer Beso)\" is a dance song, and climbed dance music charts soon after its release in June 2002 hitting the [[Billboard Top 40]] Dance Charts. However, due to business reasons, Nayer\u2019s debut album was never released.\n\nNayer was discovered by Cuban-American rapper [[Pitbull (entertainer)|Pitbull]] in 2009 whom she had the opportunity to do a collaboration with a few years back while signed to Sony. She immediately got in with producers and started working on her music & song-writing, while in the process she appeared on various videos of the rapper from his albums ''[[Rebelution (Pitbull album)|Rebelution]]'' (2009), ''[[Armando (album)|Armando]]'' (2010) and ''[[Planet Pit]]'' (2011), such as \"[[I Know You Want Me (Calle Ocho)]]\" and \"[[Shut It Down (song)|Shut It Down]]\" (feat. [[Akon]]). She then did a joint venture with [[RedOne]] who quickly believed that he saw the Star quality and the \"IT\" factor in Nayer, \"She's a Superstar!\". Nayer was also featured on Enrique Iglesias' single \"[[Dirty Dancer]] (Remix)\" along [[Usher (entertainer)|Usher]] and [[Lil Wayne]], and she held a cameo appearance in Enrique Iglesias' \"[[I Like How It Feels]]\" music video.\n\nShe was also a featured artist on Pitbull's smash \"[[Give Me Everything]]\", along with [[Ne-Yo]] and [[Afrojack]]. Nayer was nominated in 2012 for MTV Video Music Award as Best Collaboration, and up for four Latin Billboard Nominations in 2013 with \"Give Me Everything\", being the 2nd female to have the most Nominations.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.directlyrics.com/pitbull-neyo--nayer-hit-up-premios-juventud-news.html |title=Pitbull, Ne-Yo & Nayer Hit Up 'Premios Juventud' |publisher=Directlyrics.com |date=2011-07-23 |accessdate=2014-06-20}}</ref>\n\nOn August 2, 2011, the singer released her single, a song titled \"[[Suave (Kiss Me)]]\", which features Pitbull and Swedish-Congolese singer [[Mohombi]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/suave-kiss-me-feat.-mohombi/id455100822 |title=iTunes - Music - Suave (Kiss Me) [feat.

In 2012, a \"promo\" video appeared on the Internet. In this video, Nayer talked about recording her album and played snippets of 3 new songs: \"Wet\", \"Love Drum\", \"Body Talk\" (featuring [[Jason Derulo]]).

In September 2013, she announced a collaboration with rapper [[Detail (record producer)|Detail]] titled \"Thirsty\". The song was released for free on [[SoundCloud]].\n\nIn 2014, Nayer decided to go back to her roots. In April 2015, she filmed two music videos.

She gained recognition in 2011 after being featured on [[Pitbull (rapper)|Pitbull]]'s hit single \"[[Give Me Everything]]\", produced by [[Afrojack]], and releasing her single \"[[Suave (Kiss Me)]]\" featuring Pitbull and Swedish-Congolese singer-songwriter [[Mohombi]] which was a success in Europe and the Middle East. Her other known collaborations include songs with [[Neyo]], [[Enrique Iglesias]], [[Lil Wayne]], [[Usher]],  [[Fonseca (singer)|Fonseca]], [[Juan Magan]], Yomil (of the Cuban duo Yomil y el Dany), [[Jean-Roch]] and [[Melissa (singer)|Melissa]].\n\n==Early life==\nNayer Regalado was born on August 2, 1989 in [[New Jersey]]. Her family moved to [[Miami]] when she was 3 months old. Her parents were born in Cuba but her mother, Maria, also has [[Lebanese people|Lebanese]] & Brazilian ancestry.\n\nNayer began a singing and acting career at the age of 7.\n\n==Career==\nNayer has appeared in numerous ads, commercials, soap operas, carnivals, foundations, charity events and TV programs. She has participated in a major talent competition named \"[[Star Search]]\" and she has also appeared in television show [[S\u00e1bado Gigante]], and in a show called ''La pi\u00f1ata loca'' (broadcast through [[Univision]]). Supported by her parents, she moved to [[Los Angeles]] when she was 14, to record a six-song demo. After shopping the demo to labels, Nayer secured a major recording deal at Miami-based and Latin music-oriented Sony Discos which was looking for a voice for a new track called \"First Kiss (Primer Beso)\". Recorded by Nayer at the age of 16, produced and remixed by DJ Fluid in both [[English language|English]] and [[Spanish language|Spanish]], \"First Kiss (Primer Beso)\" is a dance song, and climbed dance music charts soon after its release in June 2002 hitting the [[Billboard Top 40]] Dance Charts. However, due to business reasons, Nayer\u2019s debut album was never released.\n\nNayer was discovered by Cuban-American rapper [[Pitbull (entertainer)|Pitbull]] in 2009 whom she had the opportunity to do a collaboration with a few years back while signed to Sony. She immediately got in with producers and started working on her music & song-writing, while in the process she appeared on various videos of the rapper from his albums ''[[Rebelution (Pitbull album)|Rebelution]]'' (2009), ''[[Armando (album)|Armando]]'' (2010) and ''[[Planet Pit]]'' (2011), such as \"[[I Know You Want Me (Calle Ocho)]]\" and \"[[Shut It Down (song)|Shut It Down]]\" (feat. [[Akon]]). She then did a joint venture with [[RedOne]] who quickly believed that he saw the Star quality and the \"IT\" factor in Nayer, \"She's a Superstar!\". Nayer was also featured on Enrique Iglesias' single \"[[Dirty Dancer]] (Remix)\" along [[Usher (entertainer)|Usher]] and [[Lil Wayne]], and she held a cameo appearance in Enrique Iglesias' \"[[I Like How It Feels]]\" music video.\n\nShe was also a featured artist on Pitbull's smash \"[[Give Me Everything]]\", along with [[Ne-Yo]] and [[Afrojack]]. Nayer was nominated in 2012 for MTV Video Music Award as Best Collaboration, and up for four Latin Billboard Nominations in 2013 with \"Give Me Everything\", being the 2nd female to have the most Nominations.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.directlyrics.com/pitbull-neyo--nayer-hit-up-premios-juventud-news.html |title=Pitbull, Ne-Yo & Nayer Hit Up 'Premios Juventud' |publisher=Directlyrics.com |date=2011-07-23 |accessdate=2014-06-20}}</ref>\n\nOn August 2, 2011, the singer released her single, a song titled \"[[Suave (Kiss Me)]]\", which features Pitbull and Swedish-Congolese singer [[Mohombi]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/suave-kiss-me-feat.-mohombi/id455100822 |title=iTunes - Music - Suave (Kiss Me) [feat.

In 2012, a \"promo\" video appeared on the Internet. In this video, Nayer talked about recording her album and played snippets of 3 new songs: \"Wet\", \"Love Drum\", \"Body Talk\" (featuring [[Jason Derulo]]). In 2013, the full version of \"Body Talk\" was posted on the Internet.\n\nIn 2012, Nayer was featured in the official remix of [[Fonseca (singer)|Fonseca]]'s single \"[[Eres Mi Sue\u00f1o]]\" and on [[Jean-Roch]]'s single \"[[Name of Love]]\".\n\nAfter going independent in 2013, Nayer changed the direction of her album to urban. In September 2013, she announced a collaboration with rapper [[Detail (record producer)|Detail]] titled \"Thirsty\". The song was released for free on [[SoundCloud]].\n\nIn 2014, Nayer decided to go back to her roots. In April 2015, she filmed two music videos. In August, she announced the release of her new single \"Mi Cuerpo\" (and its fully English version \"My Body\"). The music videos for \"Mi Cuerpo\" and \"My Body\" were released on her [[Vevo]] channel on August 11, 2015. The singles were released on all the music platforms on August 14. The second music video that she filmed in the beginning of that year was for the song \"Leila\". In 2017, Nayer posted a teaser of the music video on her Instagram but the full video hasn't been released yet.\n\nSpanish artist [[Juan Mag\u00e1n]] announced on his [[Twitter]] that he would release his collaboration with Nayer and [[Dasoul]], produced by [[Daddy Yankee]] in \"a couple of weeks\". The song was released in the beginning of July 2016 as a part of his \"Quiero Que Sepas\" EP.\n\nOn April 14, 2017, Nayer released a new single \"Yo Soy Lo Que Tu Quieres\" featuring Chacal. The music video premiered on June 14.\n\nIn December 2017, Nayer appeared on AllStar 305's single \"Miami Se Calienta\". The music video was released on February 27, 2018.\n\nThe music video for Nayer's song \"Adiccion\" featuring Yomil was released on May 23, 2018.\n\nIn July, Nayer announced that the music video for her collaboration with the Lebanese (arabic) singer [[Melissa (singer)|Melissa]] called \"Leily Leily\" would be released on July 20. The song was also released as a single on all the big music platforms on August 20.\n\nOn September 10, 2018, Nayer has launched her own makeup brand \"Krisbella Beauty\". The collection consists of liquid lipsticks and lip liners.

The other two sons of Noah, [[Shem]] and [[Ham (son of Noah)|Ham]], are the eponymous ancestors of the [[Semites]] and the [[Hamites]], respectively.\n\nIn medieval [[ethnography]], the world was believed to have been divided into three large-scale racial groupings, corresponding to the three classical continents: the Semitic peoples of [[Near East|Asia]], the Hamitic peoples of [[Ancient Libya|Africa]] and the Japhetic peoples of [[Europe]].\n\nThe term has been used in modern times as a designation in [[physical anthropology]], [[ethnography]] and [[comparative linguistics]]. \nIn anthropology, it was used in a racial sense for \"[[white people]]\" (the [[Caucasian race]]). In linguistics it was used as a term for the [[Indo-European languages]]. These uses are now mostly obsolete. In a linguistic sense, only the [[Semitic peoples]] form a well-defined family. The Indo-European group is no longer known as \"Japhetite\", and the [[Hamitic]] group is now recognized as [[paraphyletic]] within the [[Afro-Asiatic languages|Afro-Asiatic]] family.\n\nAmong Muslim historians, Japheth is usually regarded as the ancestor of the [[Gog and Magog]] tribes, and, at times, of the [[Turkic peoples|Turks]], [[Khazars]], and [[Slavs]].<ref>''Encyclopedia of Islam'', ''Yafith'', 236</ref>\n\n==Biblical genealogy==\nIt is written in ''[[Book of Genesis|Genesis]]'': \"The sons of Japheth: Gomer, and Magog, and Madai, and Javan, and Tubal, and Meshech, and Tiras. and the sons of Gomer: Ashkenaz, and Riphath, and Togarmah. And the sons of Javan: Elishah, and Tarshish, Kittim, and Dodanim. By these were the Isles of the Gentile divided in their lands everyone after his tongue, after their families, in their nations.\" (Gen 10:2-5)\n\nIn the [[Bible]], Japheth is ascribed seven sons and seven named grandsons:\n\n* [[Gomer (Bible)|Gomer]]\n** [[Ashkenaz]]\n** [[Riphath]]\n** [[Togarmah]]\n* [[Magog (Bible)|Magog]]\n* [[Madai]]\n* [[Javan]]\n** [[Elishah]]\n** [[Tarshish]]\n** [[Kittim]]\n** [[Dodanim]]\n* [[Tubal]]\n* [[Meshech]]\n* [[Tiras]]\n\nThe intended ethnic identity of these \"descendants of Japheth\" is not certain; however, over history, they have been identified by Biblical scholars with various historical nations who were deemed to be descendants of Japheth and his sons &mdash; a practice dating back at least to the classical encounters of Jew with [[Hellene]], for example [[Josephus]] states in the ''[[Antiquities of the Jews]]'', I.VI.122 ([http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=J.+AJ+1.122 Whiston]) that:\n:Japhet, the son of Noah, had seven sons: they inhabited so, that, beginning at the mountains Taurus and Amanus, they proceeded along Asia, as far as the river Tanais (Don), and along Europe to Cadiz; and settling themselves on the lands which they light upon, which none had inhabited before, they called the nations by their own names.\n\nJosephus detailed the nations supposed to have descended from the seven sons of Japheth.\n\n==Ancient and medieval ethnography==\n\n===Pseudo-Philo===\nAn ancient, relatively obscure text known as [[Pseudo-Philo]] and thought to have been originally written ca. 70 AD, contains an expanded genealogy that is seemingly garbled from that of Genesis, and also different from the much later one found in Jasher:<ref>[http://www.sacred-texts.com/bib/bap/bap20.htm Pseudo-Philo]</ref>\n\n*Sons of Japheth: \"Gomer, Magog, and Madai, Nidiazech, Tubal, Mocteras, Cenez, Riphath, and Thogorma, Elisa, Dessin, Cethin, Tudant.\"\n**Sons of Gomer: Thelez, Lud, Deberlet.\n**Sons of Magog: Cesse, Thipha, Pharuta, Ammiel, Phimei, Goloza, Samanach.\n**Sons of Duden: Sallus, Phelucta Phallita.\n**Sons of Tubal: Phanatonova, Eteva.\n**Sons of Tyras: Maac, Tabel, Ballana, Samplameac, Elaz.\n**Sons of Mellech: Amboradat, Urach, Bosara.\n**Sons of Ascenez: Jubal, Zaraddana, Anac.\n**Sons of Heri: Phuddet, Doad, Dephadzeat, Enoc.\n**Sons of Togorma: Abiud, Saphath, Asapli, Zepthir.\n**Sons of Elisa: Etzaac, Zenez, Mastisa, Rira.\n**Sons of Zepti: Macziel, Temna, Aela, Phinon.\n**Sons of Tessis: Meccul, Loon, Zelataban.\n**Sons of Duodennin: Itheb, Beath, Phenech.\n\n===Later writers===\nSome of the nations that various later writers (including [[Jerome]] and [[Isidore of Seville]], as well as other traditional accounts) have attempted to described as Japhetites are listed below:\n\n* [[Gomer]]: [[Scythians]], [[Cimmerians]] [[Phrygia]]ns, [[Turkic peoples|Turks]] (without Avars and Tatars), [[Bulgars]], [[Armenians]] (including most of other related people in Caucasus), [[Welsh people|Welsh]], [[Picts]], [[Germans|Germanic People]] (excluding North Germanic), [[Teuton]]s ([[Germanic peoples]]), [[Celts]]\n* [[Magog (Bible)|Magog]]: [[Scythians]], [[Goths]], [[Swedes]], [[North Germanic peoples|Scandinavians]], [[Finns]], [[Huns]], [[Slavs]] (not including East Slavs, Bulgarians and Macedonians), [[Magyars]] ([[Hungarians]]), [[Irish people|Irish]], [[Armenians]] (including most of other related people in Caucasus)\n* [[Madai]]: [[Mitanni]], [[Mannai]], [[Medes]], more generally [[Persian people|Persian]]s or even their relatives\n* [[Javan]]: [[Ionia]]ns ([[Greeks]]), [[Tartessians]], [[Ancient Grecians]]\n* [[Tubal]]: [[Tabal]]i, [[Circassians]], [[Irish people|Irish]], [[Georgians]] (including most of other related people in Caucasus), [[Illyrians]], [[Ancient Italic peoples|Italic]]s (not including Latin who are of Etruscan origin), [[Iberians]], [[Basque people|Basques]]\n*[[Meshech]]: [[East Slavs]] (including Russians), [[Phrygia]]ns (possible), [[Mushki|Moschoi]], [[Meskheti]], [[Georgians]], [[Armenians]], [[Illyrians]], [[Irish people|Irish]]\n* [[Tiras]]: [[Thracians]], [[Etruscans]] (Romans), [[Romanians]]\n\nIrish and Armeniano-Caucas have many different origins. Italy was populated by many peoples.\n\n==Renaissance to Early Modern ethnography==\n\n===Book of Jasher===\nThe \"[[Sefer haYashar (midrash)|Book of Jasher]]\", a [[midrash]] (elaboration of the biblical text) first printed in 1625, ostensibly based on an earlier edition of 1552, provides some new names for Japheth's grandchildren. \n*[[Gomer]] (sons were [[Ashkenaz (Bible)|Ashkenaz]], [[Riphath]] and [[Togarmah]]<ref>{{Jasher|7:3}}</ref>)\n*[[Magog (Bible)|Magog]] (sons were Elichanaf and Lubal<ref>{{Jasher|7:4}}</ref>) \n*[[Madai]] (sons were Achon, Zeelo, Chazoni and Lot)\n*[[Javan]] (sons were [[Elishah]], [[Tarshish]], [[Kittim]] and [[Dodanim]]<ref>{{Jasher|7:6}}</ref>)\n*[[Tubal]] (sons were Ariphi, Kesed and Taari<ref>{{Jasher|7:7}}</ref>)\n*[[Meshech]] (sons were Dedon, Zaron and Shebashni<ref>{{Jasher|7:8}}</ref>) \n*[[Tiras]] (sons were Benib, Gera, Lupirion and Gilak<ref>{{Jasher|7:9}}</ref>)\n\n==Anthropology==\n{{main|Caucasian race}}\nThe term [[Caucasian race|Caucasian]] as a racial label for Europeans derives in part from the assumption that the tribe of Japheth developed its distinctive racial characteristics in the Caucasus area, having migrated there from [[Mount Ararat]] before populating Europe.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}} In the same vein, [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]]n nationalist histories associated Japheth's sons with certain ancient tribes of the Caucasus area, called [[Tubal]]s ([[Tabal]]s, ''Tibarenoi'' in Greek) and [[Meshech]]s (Meshekhs/Mosokhs, ''Moschoi'' in Greek), who they claimed represented ancient pre-[[Proto-Indo-Europeans|Indo-European]] and non-Semitic, possibly \"Proto-[[Caucasian Iberia|Iberian]]\", tribes of [[Asia Minor]] of the [[3rd millennium BC|3rd]]-[[1st millennium BC|1st millennia BC]]. This theory influenced the use of the term ''Japhetic'' in the linguistic theories of [[Nikolai Marr]] (see below). \n \nDuring the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, the Biblical statement attributed to Noah that \"God shall enlarge Japheth\" (Genesis 9:27) was used by some preachers <ref>Meagher, James L. \"The Bread, Wine, Water, Oil, and Incense in the Temple\" [https://archive.org/details/HowChristSaidTheFirstMass ''How Christ Said The First Mass.''

By these were the Isles of the Gentile divided in their lands everyone after his tongue, after their families, in their nations.\" (Gen 10:2-5)\n\nIn the [[Bible]], Japheth is ascribed seven sons and seven named grandsons:\n\n* [[Gomer (Bible)|Gomer]]\n** [[Ashkenaz]]\n** [[Riphath]]\n** [[Togarmah]]\n* [[Magog (Bible)|Magog]]\n* [[Madai]]\n* [[Javan]]\n** [[Elishah]]\n** [[Tarshish]]\n** [[Kittim]]\n** [[Dodanim]]\n* [[Tubal]]\n* [[Meshech]]\n* [[Tiras]]\n\nThe intended ethnic identity of these \"descendants of Japheth\" is not certain; however, over history, they have been identified by Biblical scholars with various historical nations who were deemed to be descendants of Japheth and his sons &mdash; a practice dating back at least to the classical encounters of Jew with [[Hellene]], for example [[Josephus]] states in the ''[[Antiquities of the Jews]]'', I.VI.122 ([http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=J.+AJ+1.122 Whiston]) that:\n:Japhet, the son of Noah, had seven sons: they inhabited so, that, beginning at the mountains Taurus and Amanus, they proceeded along Asia, as far as the river Tanais (Don), and along Europe to Cadiz; and settling themselves on the lands which they light upon, which none had inhabited before, they called the nations by their own names.\n\nJosephus detailed the nations supposed to have descended from the seven sons of Japheth.\n\n==Ancient and medieval ethnography==\n\n===Pseudo-Philo===\nAn ancient, relatively obscure text known as [[Pseudo-Philo]] and thought to have been originally written ca. 70 AD, contains an expanded genealogy that is seemingly garbled from that of Genesis, and also different from the much later one found in Jasher:<ref>[http://www.sacred-texts.com/bib/bap/bap20.htm Pseudo-Philo]</ref>\n\n*Sons of Japheth: \"Gomer, Magog, and Madai, Nidiazech, Tubal, Mocteras, Cenez, Riphath, and Thogorma, Elisa, Dessin, Cethin, Tudant.\"\n**Sons of Gomer: Thelez, Lud, Deberlet.\n**Sons of Magog: Cesse, Thipha, Pharuta, Ammiel, Phimei, Goloza, Samanach.\n**Sons of Duden: Sallus, Phelucta Phallita.\n**Sons of Tubal: Phanatonova, Eteva.\n**Sons of Tyras: Maac, Tabel, Ballana, Samplameac, Elaz.\n**Sons of Mellech: Amboradat, Urach, Bosara.\n**Sons of Ascenez: Jubal, Zaraddana, Anac.\n**Sons of Heri: Phuddet, Doad, Dephadzeat, Enoc.\n**Sons of Togorma: Abiud, Saphath, Asapli, Zepthir.\n**Sons of Elisa: Etzaac, Zenez, Mastisa, Rira.\n**Sons of Zepti: Macziel, Temna, Aela, Phinon.\n**Sons of Tessis: Meccul, Loon, Zelataban.\n**Sons of Duodennin: Itheb, Beath, Phenech.\n\n===Later writers===\nSome of the nations that various later writers (including [[Jerome]] and [[Isidore of Seville]], as well as other traditional accounts) have attempted to described as Japhetites are listed below:\n\n* [[Gomer]]: [[Scythians]], [[Cimmerians]] [[Phrygia]]ns, [[Turkic peoples|Turks]] (without Avars and Tatars), [[Bulgars]], [[Armenians]] (including most of other related people in Caucasus), [[Welsh people|Welsh]], [[Picts]], [[Germans|Germanic People]] (excluding North Germanic), [[Teuton]]s ([[Germanic peoples]]), [[Celts]]\n* [[Magog (Bible)|Magog]]: [[Scythians]], [[Goths]], [[Swedes]], [[North Germanic peoples|Scandinavians]], [[Finns]], [[Huns]], [[Slavs]] (not including East Slavs, Bulgarians and Macedonians), [[Magyars]] ([[Hungarians]]), [[Irish people|Irish]], [[Armenians]] (including most of other related people in Caucasus)\n* [[Madai]]: [[Mitanni]], [[Mannai]], [[Medes]], more generally [[Persian people|Persian]]s or even their relatives\n* [[Javan]]: [[Ionia]]ns ([[Greeks]]), [[Tartessians]], [[Ancient Grecians]]\n* [[Tubal]]: [[Tabal]]i, [[Circassians]], [[Irish people|Irish]], [[Georgians]] (including most of other related people in Caucasus), [[Illyrians]], [[Ancient Italic peoples|Italic]]s (not including Latin who are of Etruscan origin), [[Iberians]], [[Basque people|Basques]]\n*[[Meshech]]: [[East Slavs]] (including Russians), [[Phrygia]]ns (possible), [[Mushki|Moschoi]], [[Meskheti]], [[Georgians]], [[Armenians]], [[Illyrians]], [[Irish people|Irish]]\n* [[Tiras]]: [[Thracians]], [[Etruscans]] (Romans), [[Romanians]]\n\nIrish and Armeniano-Caucas have many different origins.

This theory influenced the use of the term ''Japhetic'' in the linguistic theories of [[Nikolai Marr]] (see below). \n \nDuring the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, the Biblical statement attributed to Noah that \"God shall enlarge Japheth\" (Genesis 9:27) was used by some preachers <ref>Meagher, James L. \"The Bread, Wine, Water, Oil, and Incense in the Temple\" [https://archive.org/details/HowChristSaidTheFirstMass ''How Christ Said The First Mass.''

In 1908, unable to fund further education, she worked for two years as a commercial illustrator, and then taught in Virginia, Texas, and South Carolina between 1911 and 1918. During that time, she studied art during the summers between 1912 and 1914 and was introduced to the principles and philosophies of [[Arthur Wesley Dow]], who created works of art based upon personal style, design, and interpretation of subjects, rather than trying to copy or represent them. This caused a major change in the way she felt about and approached art, as seen in the beginning stages of her watercolors from her studies at the [[O'Keeffe at the University of Virginia, 1912-1914|University of Virginia]] and more dramatically in the charcoal drawings that she produced in 1915 that led to total abstraction. [[Alfred Stieglitz]], an art dealer and photographer, held an exhibit of her works in 1917.<ref>{{Cite book|title=50 women artists you should know|last=Christiane.|first=Weidemann|date=2008|publisher=Prestel|others=Larass, Petra., Klier, Melanie, 1970-|isbn=9783791339566|location=Munich|oclc=195744889|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/50womenartistsyo0000weid|access-date=2020-03-04|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200404213413/https://archive.org/details/50womenartistsyo0000weid|archive-date=2020-04-04|url-status=live}}</ref> Over the next couple of years, she taught and continued her studies at the [[Teachers College, Columbia University]] in 1914 and 1915.\n\nShe moved to New York in 1918 at Stieglitz's request and began working seriously as an artist. They developed a professional relationship and a personal relationship that led to their marriage in 1924. O'Keeffe created many forms of abstract art, including close-ups of flowers, such as the ''[[Red Canna (paintings)|Red Canna]]'' paintings, that many found to represent female genitalia,<ref>{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=November 9, 1987|title=An unabashedly sensual approach to a genteel genre|url=|journal=Newsweek|volume=110|pages=74\u201375|via=Readers' Guide Abstracts}}</ref> although O'Keeffe consistently denied that intention.{{Citation needed |reason=\"Consistently\" implies several denials, but not even a single one is cited in the article. |date=June 2018}} The reputation of the portrayal of women's sexuality was also fueled by explicit and sensuous photographs that Stieglitz had taken and exhibited of O'Keeffe.\n\nO'Keeffe and Stieglitz lived together in New York until 1929, when O'Keeffe began spending part of the year in the Southwest, which served as inspiration for her paintings of [[New Mexico]] landscapes and images of animal skulls, such as ''[[Cow's Skull: Red, White, and Blue]]'' and ''Ram's Head White Hollyhock and Little Hills.'' After Stieglitz's death, she lived permanently in New Mexico at [[Georgia O'Keeffe Home and Studio]] in [[Abiqui\u00fa, New Mexico|Abiqui\u00fa]], until the last years of her life when she lived in [[Santa Fe, New Mexico|Santa Fe]].

In 1908, unable to fund further education, she worked for two years as a commercial illustrator, and then taught in Virginia, Texas, and South Carolina between 1911 and 1918. During that time, she studied art during the summers between 1912 and 1914 and was introduced to the principles and philosophies of [[Arthur Wesley Dow]], who created works of art based upon personal style, design, and interpretation of subjects, rather than trying to copy or represent them. This caused a major change in the way she felt about and approached art, as seen in the beginning stages of her watercolors from her studies at the [[O'Keeffe at the University of Virginia, 1912-1914|University of Virginia]] and more dramatically in the charcoal drawings that she produced in 1915 that led to total abstraction.

He lived in Lahore during the period of his discipleship and attained a high position in the beauracracy as a deputy controller of military accounts. \n\nHe was the President of the World Fellowship of Religions, an organization recognized by [[UNESCO]], which had representatives from all the main religions of the world. Beginning with the publication of Gurmat Sidhant, authored by him in the late 1930's and published under his Guru's name, during the period of his ministry he published many books and circulars that were translated into numerous languages.\n\nThe teaching of the Surat Shabd Yoga is a path of personal spiritual attainment under the guidance of a living spiritual master.  The basic teachings consist in opening the inner eye or third eye to develop vision of inner light and inner sound. This is considered to be the power of the unmanifested Godhead coming into expression and is called ''Word'' in the [[Bible]], and ''Naam'', ''Shabd'', ''Om'', ''Kalma'', and other names in the other scriptures. Kirpal Singh taught that the practice of meditation on the Divine Word, or the Yoga of the Sound Current ([[Surat Shabd Yoga]]) was at the spiritual base of all religions.\n\n==Life==\nFrom youth, Kirpal Singh had visionary experience and foreknowledge of events. He sought guidance from various [[sufi]]s, [[yogi]]s and [[mysticism|mystics]], but never accepted any of them as a master, and continued his spiritual practice and prayers for the guidance of a living teacher. In 1917, he began to see a spiritual form that he believed was [[Guru Nanak]], founder of the Sikh religion. In 1924, he met [[Baba Sawan Singh|Hazur Sawan Singh]], the famous Saint of Beas, in his Ashram on the banks of the Beas River, and in him recognized the luminous form he had seen during the seven previous years. Hazur initiated him into Surat Shabd Yoga, and from then on Kirpal Singh dedicated his life to the mission of his spiritual Master and to his practices, while married, with children and in a responsible government position. Baba Sawan Singh asked him to meditate six hours daily, a practice which he maintained throughout his discipleship, despite his life responsibilities.\n\nFrom early the 1930s on, when Hazur was asked if he had a disciple who had made great progress, he cited Kirpal Singh. In the same years, on inspiration from his master, Kirpal began writing the \"Gurmat Siddhant\" (\"The Philosophy of the Masters\"), a two-volume spiritual work, in the Punjabi and Urdu languages. It was published, on Kirpal request, under the name of Hazur Sawan Singh. In the 1960s, it was published in English in five volumes. Ruhani Satsang published a number of books under Kirpal Singh's name that were essentially portions of Gurmat Sidhant.\n\nOn the morning of 12 October 1947, Hazur Sawan Singh entrusted his disciple Kirpal Singh with the work of continuing his spiritual mission. The next month, Hazur approved the project of the \"Ruhani Satsang\" (School of Spirituality or Science of the Soul) Kirpal presented to him. Hazur Sawan Singh died on 2 April 1948, following a brief illness.\n\nAfter his master's passing, Kirpal went to [[Rishikesh]] at the foot of the [[Himalaya|Himalayan Mountains]], where he spent the next five months in an almost continual state of [[samadhi]], or absorption in God.\n\nAt the end of this period of intense meditation, Kirpal Singh received an inner command from his master: \"Return to the world and bring my children back to me.\" He moved to [[Delhi]], where people from Punjab were looking for refuge because of the division from Pakistan, and there began his spiritual and humanitarian mission.\n\nKirpal initiated over 80,000 followers{{sfn|Lewis|2002|p=591}}\n\n==Ruhani Satsang==\nIn Delhi, Kirpal Singh founded his new school of spiritual research and realization, called Ruhani Satsang (School of Spirituality or Science of the Soul), which would go on to have branches in many nations of the world. In 1951 he built the Sawan Ashram, in the neighborhood of Shakti Nagar  on the outskirts of the city, where his spiritual talks (satsangs) were soon followed by thousands of people.\n\nHe began to have visits from western disciples. The first was Rusel Jacque, whose account of his six months at the ashram in 1959 (Gurudev: the Lord of Compassion) encouraged others to make the journey. At the beginning of the sixties, an average 40 to 50 disciples stayed at the ashram from three weeks to six months.\n\n==World Fellowship of Religions==\nIn 1957, Singh was elected the first president of the World Fellowship of Religions, an organization recognized by UNESCO, comprising representatives from all the major world religions. He held that position until 1971, and presided over four World Conferences.\n\nOn September 2, 1962, at Sawan Ashram, before a gathering of over ten thousand people, he became the first non-Christian to receive the Golden Star of the Sovereign Order of Saint John of Jerusaem ([[Knights Hospitaller|Knights of Malta]]) for his spiritual and humanitarian work.{{sfn|Sena|1976|p=xiv,353,364}}{{sfn|Jones|Ryan|2006|p=417-418}}{{sfn|Singh|1993|p=146}}{{sfn|Arnsby-Jones|1965|p=43}} On this occasion he received the congratulations of India's prime minister, [[Jawaharlal Nehru]], and established a spiritual tie with him that continued with prime ministers [[Lal Bahadur Shastri]] and [[Indira Gandhi]].\n\nOn January 4, 1964, during a memorable ceremony held in the great auditorium of the Miami Senior High School, he was awarded the Cross of the Sovereign and Imperial Order of Saint Constantine the Great. Several hundred people, including leading dignitaries of the local government, attended this event. The award was made by the Reverend Dr. \u201cMark\u201d A.C. Karras, who heads the Hellenic Sector of the Constantinian Order in the United States of America. Dr. Karras stated that the widely known unifying and spiritual efforts made by His Holiness Sant Kirpal Singh for the benefit of humanity were in keeping with the noble Byzantine ideal.{{sfn|Arnsby-Jones|1965|pp=159-160}}\n\n==World tour==\n===First tour===\nSingh's mission continued to grow rapidly. In 1955, he made his first trip abroad to spread his teachings, and spent months in the United States and Europe. It was the first time an Indian spiritual master had visited the West. In those years, Eastern spiritual practices were generally unfamiliar to the West. Singh had hundreds of Westerners initiated and placed on the path of meditation, which he claimed led to contact with the Divine Light and Harmony.\n\nIn 1963, Singh made his second world tour, this time as president of the World Fellowship of Religions. He met with political leaders and other religious leaders, including [[Pope Paul VI]] and the Patriarch of the Eastern Orthodox Churches [[Patriarch Athenagoras I of Constantinople|Atenagora I]]. At the same time, he continued to instruct new seekers on the path of the Way of the Masters ([[Sant Mat]]).\n\nOn 26 August 1972, Sant Kirpal Singh conducted his third and final tour of the West, where he received and instructed more than 2000 new disciples of the Path of Spirituality.\n\n==Final year==\n{{unreferenced section|date=March 2014}}\nIn Delhi in February 1974, Singh organized the World Conference on Unity of Man. More than 2000 delegates attended, including religious and political leaders from India and around the world. Over 100,000 people attended the conference in total.\n\nAt the Kumba Mela (Festival of Religions) in [[Haridwar]] on 2 April of the same year, Singh gathered [[sadhu]]s (itinerant monks) and \"saintly men\" in the Conference of National Unity, with the aims of promoting cooperation, eliminating religious barriers, and bettering the economic status of India's poor.\n\n==Legacy and succession==\nIn 1974 Kirpal Singh established the Unity of Man conference, which was intended as a platform to bring together both religious and political leaders towards finding common ground and improved relations. This conference, under the name, Human Unity Conference, continues to this day.\n\nKirpal Singh left his earthly form on 21 August 1974, at the age of eighty.{{sfn|Lane|2015}} He was ambiguous regarding his succession.  Shortly before his passing he stated, \"So Word is sometimes manifest as Kabir, sometimes this, sometimes that. The Word never changes. When your friend comes today in a white suit, tomorrow in yellow clothes, third day in brown clothes, would you not recognize Him? I hope you recognize and do not discard Him [chuckles]. That's all I can say. ...\"\n\nAfter his passing there rapidly developed fissures in his organization regarding succession. {{sfn|Lewis|2002|p=591}}{{sfn|Diem-Lane|2015}}\n\nIn 1963, Sant Kirpal Singh had declared following.\n\"At this time I know of nobody who is competent to take on this work; whether someone comes up in the future is in God's hands.\" Then He stated most forcefully: \"Whoever may come up in the future, I tell you most definitely that he will NOT be a member of my family!\" \"<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.ruhanisatsangusa.org/pdf/ss74/ss197411.pdf | title= Sat Sandesh, the Magazine of the Master. page 26 - right column | author=Sat Sandesh USA |date= 1974}}</ref>\n \nThere is Pier Franco Marcenaro, who, after his Initiation in January 1968, was his Group Leader and Representative in Milan, Italy, and is today a recognized successor by many disciples organized in an association called The School of Spirituality{{sfn|Marcenaro|1995}}.

Ajaib Singh had an extensive following in the west as well as having a significant impact on the satsang of Baba Somanath, a south Indian disciple of Baba Sawan Singh who had functioned as a guru in the south until his death in 1976. Ajaib was introduced to the sangat of Somanath by several of Somanath's western disciples, of whom there were about a dozen.  There have been several gurus who eventually followed Ajaib singh, namely Sadhu Ram in the north and Baba Ram Singh in the south of India.  {{sfn|Melton|2003|p=1060}}{{sfn|Chryssides|2012|p=304}}{{sfn|Chryssides|2006|p=282}} Arran Stephens, a well-known Canadian initiate of Sant Kirpal Singh also initially joined in supporting Ajaib,{{sfn|Chryssides|2012|p=304}}{{sfn|Chryssides|2006|p=282}}{{sfn|Diem-Lane|2015}} although he later regretfully recanted his support and came to follow Darshan Singh.{{sfn|Chryssides|2006|p=282}}{{sfn|Diem-Lane|2015}} [[Thakar Singh]],had been put forward some eighteen months after the passing of Sant Kirpal Singh by Hardevi, known as Tai Ji, an initiate of Sawan Singh and close sevadar in the mnission of Sant Kirpal Singh.

However, his organization grew to be fairly extensive until his death in 2005 and continues to this day under Sant Baljit Singh.{{sfn|Lewis|2002|p=591}}{{sfn|Diem-Lane|2015|loc=Chapter 2: The History Of Radhasoami In The United States}}.

He lived in Lahore during the period of his discipleship and attained a high position in the beauracracy as a deputy controller of military accounts. \n\nHe was the President of the World Fellowship of Religions, an organization recognized by [[UNESCO]], which had representatives from all the main religions of the world. Beginning with the publication of Gurmat Sidhant, authored by him in the late 1930's and published under his Guru's name, during the period of his ministry he published many books and circulars that were translated into numerous languages.\n\nThe teaching of the Surat Shabd Yoga is a path of personal spiritual attainment under the guidance of a living spiritual master.  The basic teachings consist in opening the inner eye or third eye to develop vision of inner light and inner sound. This is considered to be the power of the unmanifested Godhead coming into expression and is called ''Word'' in the [[Bible]], and ''Naam'', ''Shabd'', ''Om'', ''Kalma'', and other names in the other scriptures. Kirpal Singh taught that the practice of meditation on the Divine Word, or the Yoga of the Sound Current ([[Surat Shabd Yoga]]) was at the spiritual base of all religions.\n\n==Life==\nFrom youth, Kirpal Singh had visionary experience and foreknowledge of events. He sought guidance from various [[sufi]]s, [[yogi]]s and [[mysticism|mystics]], but never accepted any of them as a master, and continued his spiritual practice and prayers for the guidance of a living teacher. In 1917, he began to see a spiritual form that he believed was [[Guru Nanak]], founder of the Sikh religion. In 1924, he met [[Baba Sawan Singh|Hazur Sawan Singh]], the famous Saint of Beas, in his Ashram on the banks of the Beas River, and in him recognized the luminous form he had seen during the seven previous years. Hazur initiated him into Surat Shabd Yoga, and from then on Kirpal Singh dedicated his life to the mission of his spiritual Master and to his practices, while married, with children and in a responsible government position. Baba Sawan Singh asked him to meditate six hours daily, a practice which he maintained throughout his discipleship, despite his life responsibilities.\n\nFrom early the 1930s on, when Hazur was asked if he had a disciple who had made great progress, he cited Kirpal Singh. In the same years, on inspiration from his master, Kirpal began writing the \"Gurmat Siddhant\" (\"The Philosophy of the Masters\"), a two-volume spiritual work, in the Punjabi and Urdu languages. It was published, on Kirpal request, under the name of Hazur Sawan Singh. In the 1960s, it was published in English in five volumes. Ruhani Satsang published a number of books under Kirpal Singh's name that were essentially portions of Gurmat Sidhant.\n\nOn the morning of 12 October 1947, Hazur Sawan Singh entrusted his disciple Kirpal Singh with the work of continuing his spiritual mission. The next month, Hazur approved the project of the \"Ruhani Satsang\" (School of Spirituality or Science of the Soul) Kirpal presented to him. Hazur Sawan Singh died on 2 April 1948, following a brief illness.\n\nAfter his master's passing, Kirpal went to [[Rishikesh]] at the foot of the [[Himalaya|Himalayan Mountains]], where he spent the next five months in an almost continual state of [[samadhi]], or absorption in God.\n\nAt the end of this period of intense meditation, Kirpal Singh received an inner command from his master: \"Return to the world and bring my children back to me.\" He moved to [[Delhi]], where people from Punjab were looking for refuge because of the division from Pakistan, and there began his spiritual and humanitarian mission.\n\nKirpal initiated over 80,000 followers{{sfn|Lewis|2002|p=591}}\n\n==Ruhani Satsang==\nIn Delhi, Kirpal Singh founded his new school of spiritual research and realization, called Ruhani Satsang (School of Spirituality or Science of the Soul), which would go on to have branches in many nations of the world. In 1951 he built the Sawan Ashram, in the neighborhood of Shakti Nagar  on the outskirts of the city, where his spiritual talks (satsangs) were soon followed by thousands of people.\n\nHe began to have visits from western disciples. The first was Rusel Jacque, whose account of his six months at the ashram in 1959 (Gurudev: the Lord of Compassion) encouraged others to make the journey. At the beginning of the sixties, an average 40 to 50 disciples stayed at the ashram from three weeks to six months.\n\n==World Fellowship of Religions==\nIn 1957, Singh was elected the first president of the World Fellowship of Religions, an organization recognized by UNESCO, comprising representatives from all the major world religions. He held that position until 1971, and presided over four World Conferences.\n\nOn September 2, 1962, at Sawan Ashram, before a gathering of over ten thousand people, he became the first non-Christian to receive the Golden Star of the Sovereign Order of Saint John of Jerusaem ([[Knights Hospitaller|Knights of Malta]]) for his spiritual and humanitarian work.{{sfn|Sena|1976|p=xiv,353,364}}{{sfn|Jones|Ryan|2006|p=417-418}}{{sfn|Singh|1993|p=146}}{{sfn|Arnsby-Jones|p=43}} On this occasion he received the congratulations of India's prime minister, [[Jawaharlal Nehru]], and established a spiritual tie with him that continued with prime ministers [[Lal Bahadur Shastri]] and [[Indira Gandhi]].\n\nOn January 4, 1964, during a memorable ceremony held in the great auditorium of the Miami Senior High School, he was awarded the Cross of the Sovereign and Imperial Order of Saint Constantine the Great. Several hundred people, including leading dignitaries of the local government, attended this event. The award was made by the Reverend Dr. \u201cMark\u201d A.C. Karras, who heads the Hellenic Sector of the Constantinian Order in the United States of America. Dr. Karras stated that the widely known unifying and spiritual efforts made by His Holiness Sant Kirpal Singh for the benefit of humanity were in keeping with the noble Byzantine ideal.{{sfn|Arnsby-Jones|pp=159-160}}\n\n==World tour==\n===First tour===\nSingh's mission continued to grow rapidly. In 1955, he made his first trip abroad to spread his teachings, and spent months in the United States and Europe. It was the first time an Indian spiritual master had visited the West. In those years, Eastern spiritual practices were generally unfamiliar to the West. Singh had hundreds of Westerners initiated and placed on the path of meditation, which he claimed led to contact with the Divine Light and Harmony.\n\nIn 1963, Singh made his second world tour, this time as president of the World Fellowship of Religions. He met with political leaders and other religious leaders, including [[Pope Paul VI]] and the Patriarch of the Eastern Orthodox Churches [[Patriarch Athenagoras I of Constantinople|Atenagora I]]. At the same time, he continued to instruct new seekers on the path of the Way of the Masters ([[Sant Mat]]).\n\nOn 26 August 1972, Sant Kirpal Singh conducted his third and final tour of the West, where he received and instructed more than 2000 new disciples of the Path of Spirituality.\n\n==Final year==\n{{unreferenced section|date=March 2014}}\nIn Delhi in February 1974, Singh organized the World Conference on Unity of Man. More than 2000 delegates attended, including religious and political leaders from India and around the world. Over 100,000 people attended the conference in total.\n\nAt the Kumba Mela (Festival of Religions) in [[Haridwar]] on 2 April of the same year, Singh gathered [[sadhu]]s (itinerant monks) and \"saintly men\" in the Conference of National Unity, with the aims of promoting cooperation, eliminating religious barriers, and bettering the economic status of India's poor.\n\n==Legacy and succession==\nIn 1974 Kirpal Singh established the Unity of Man conference, which was intended as a platform to bring together both religious and political leaders towards finding common ground and improved relations. This conference, under the name, Human Unity Conference, continues to this day.\n\nKirpal Singh left his earthly form on 21 August 1974, at the age of eighty.{{sfn|Lane|2015}} He was ambiguous regarding his succession.  Shortly before his passing he stated, \"So Word is sometimes manifest as Kabir, sometimes this, sometimes that. The Word never changes. When your friend comes today in a white suit, tomorrow in yellow clothes, third day in brown clothes, would you not recognize Him? I hope you recognize and do not discard Him [chuckles]. That's all I can say. ...\"\n\nAfter his passing there rapidly developed fissures in his organization regarding succession. {{sfn|Lewis|2002|p=591}}{{sfn|Diem-Lane|2015}}\n\nIn 1963, Sant Kirpal Singh had declared following.\n\"At this time I know of nobody who is competent to take on this work; whether someone comes up in the future is in God's hands.\" Then He stated most forcefully: \"Whoever may come up in the future, I tell you most definitely that he will NOT be a member of my family!\" \"<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.ruhanisatsangusa.org/pdf/ss74/ss197411.pdf | title= Sat Sandesh, the Magazine of the Master. page 26 - right column | author=Sat Sandesh USA |date= 1974}}</ref>\n \nThere is Pier Franco Marcenaro, who, after his Initiation in January 1968, was his Group Leader and Representative in Milan, Italy, and is today a recognized successor by many disciples organized in an association called The School of Spirituality{{sfn|Marcenaro|1995}}.

His mission has attracted also interest beyond Italy and Eastern Europe.\n\n\nOne of  successor of Sant Kirpal Singh was [[Darshan Singh (Sant Mat)|Darshan Singh]], though this was not without considerable dispute in some quarters. Darshan Singh established his own ashram, Kirpal Ashram in Delhi.

Ajaib Singh had an extensive following in the west as well as having a significant impact on the satsang of Baba Somanath, a south Indian disciple of Baba Sawan Singh who had functioned as a guru in the south until his death in 1976. Ajaib was introduced to the sangat of Somanath by several of Somanath's western disciples, of whom there were about a dozen.  There have been several gurus who eventually followed Ajaib singh, namely Sadhu Ram in the north and Baba Ram Singh in the south of India.  {{sfn|Melton|2003|p=1060}}{{sfn|Chryssides|2012|p=304}}{{sfn|Chryssides|2006|p=282}} Arran Stephens, a well-known Canadian initiate of Sant Kirpal Singh also initially joined in supporting Ajaib,{{sfn|Chryssides|2012|p=304}}{{sfn|Chryssides|2006|p=282}}{{sfn|Diem-Lane|2015}} although he later regretfully recanted his support and came to follow Darshan Singh.{{sfn|Chryssides|2006|p=282}}{{sfn|Diem-Lane|2015}} [[Thakar Singh]],had been put forward some eighteen months after the passing of Sant Kirpal Singh by Hardevi, known as Tai Ji, an initiate of Sawan Singh and close sevadar in the mnission of Sant Kirpal Singh. Eventually allegations of sexual abuse and physical violence led to legal action to remove him from Sawan Ashram. However, his organization grew to be fairly extensive until his death in 2005 and continues to this day under Sant Baljit Singh.{{sfn|Lewis|2002|p=591}}{{sfn|Diem-Lane|2015|loc=Chapter 2: The History Of Radhasoami In The United States}}.

{"title_page": "History of Mauritius", "text_new": "{{More citations needed|date=August 2009}}\n{{History of Mauritius}}\nThe known '''history of Mauritius''' begins with its discovery by [[Arabs]], followed by [[Europeans]] and its appearance on maps in the early 16th century. [[Mauritius]] was successively colonized by the [[Netherlands|Dutch]], the [[France|French]] and the [[United Kingdom|British]], and became independent in 1968.\n\n==Discovery==\nMauritius was first discovered by [[The Moors|the Moors]]. This is corroborated by the earliest existing historical evidence of an island, now known as Mauritius, which is on a map produced by the [[Italian people|Italian]] cartographer [[Alberto Cantino]] in 1502.<ref>Toorawa, S. 2007. ''The medieval Waqwaq islands and the Mascarenes''. Hassam Toorawa Trust, Port Louis, Mauritius</ref>  Cantino shows three islands which are thought to represent the Mascarenes ([[R\u00e9union]], Mauritius and Rodrigues) and calls them Dina Margabin, Dina Arobi, and Dina Moraze. The medieval Arab world called the [[Indian Ocean]] island region [[W\u0101\u1e33w\u0101\u1e33|Waqwaq]].<ref>Tolan, J. (2015). Europe and the Islamic World: A history. Princeton University Press. pp 11.</ref>\n\n==Portuguese discoveries (1507\u20131513)==\nMauritius was later discovered and visited by the [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] between 1507 and 1513. Mauritius and surrounding islands were known as the Mascarene Islands [[Ilhas Mascarenhas]]  after Pedro Mascarenhas. [[File:Descobrimentos e explora\u00e7\u00f5es portuguesesV2.png|thumb|center|800px|Portuguese Discoveries 1415\u20131543 in the Reign of [[Jo\u00e3o III de Portugal|D. Jo\u00e3o III]] (verde)]]{{clr}}\n\nAn official world map by [[Diogo Ribeiro]] described \"from west to east, the first island, 'Mascarenhas', the second, 'Santa Apolonia' and the third, 'Domingo Froiz.' \"<ref>Albert Pitot, ''T\u2019Eyland Mauritius, Esquisses Historiques (1598\u20131710)'' 1905, p. 4.</ref> The three islands ([[R\u00e9union]], Mauritius and [[Rodrigues (island)|Rodrigues]]) were encountered some years earlier by chance during an exploratory expedition of the coast of the [[Bay of Bengal]] led by [[Trist\u00e3o da Cunha]]. The expedition ran into a [[cyclone]] and was forced to change course. Thus, the ship ''Cirne'' of the captain [[Diogo Fernandes Pereira]], came into view of R\u00e9union island on 9 February 1507. They called the island \"Santa Apolonia\" (\"[[Saint Apollonia]]\") in honor of that day's saint. Mauritius was encountered during the same expedition and received the name of \"Cirne\" and Rodrigues that of \"Diogo Fernandes\".<ref>Jacques Auber, ''Histoire de l\u2019oc\u00e9an Indien'', 1955, p. 233</ref> Five years later, the islands were visited by [[Pedro Mascarenhas|Dom Pedro de Mascarenhas]]<ref>[[Auguste Toussaint]] attributes the discovery of Mauritius to Mascarenhas whereas Albert Pitot hesitates to do so.

The Portuguese took no interest in these isolated islands. They were already established in Asia in [[Goa]], on the coast of Malabar, on the island of Ceylon (now [[Sri Lanka]]) and on the Malaysian coast.\n\nTheir main African base was in [[Mozambique]], therefore the [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] navigators preferred to use the [[Mozambique Channel]] to go to India. The [[Comoros]] at the north proved to be a more practical port of call. Thus no permanent colony was established on the island by the Portuguese.\n\n==Dutch East India Company era (1598-1710)==\n{{main article|Dutch Mauritius|Governor of Dutch Mauritius}}\n[[File:Vereenigde Oostindische Compagnie spiegelretourschip Amsterdam replica.jpg|thumb|Replica of an [[East Indiaman]] of the [[Dutch East India Company]]/[[United East Indies Company]] (VOC).]]\n[[File:Van Keulen - De Z.

The eight ships ran into foul weather after passing the Cape of Good Hope, and were separated. Three found their way to the northeast of [[Madagascar]], while the remaining five regrouped and sailed in a southeasterly direction. On 17 September, the five ships under the orders of Admiral van Warwyck came into view of Mauritius. On 20 September, they entered a sheltered bay which they named \"Port de Warwick\" (now known as \"Grand Port\"). They landed and decided to name the island \"Prins Mauritz van Nassaueiland,\" after the son of [[William the Silent]], [[Maurice,_Prince_of_Orange|Prince Maurits]] ([[Latin]] version: Mauritius) of the [[House of Nassau]], the ''[[stadtholder]]'' of most of the [[Dutch Republic]], and after the main vessel of the fleet, the \"Mauritius\". From that time, only the name Mauritius has remained. On 2 October, the ships again took to the sea towards Bantam.\nSome of the descendants of William of Orange through the female line reside in Mauritius, including Jill Holloway, a distinguished businesswoman, marine journalist and writer.\n<ref>Charles John Smythe Pioneer, Premier and Administrator of Natal Daphne Child Publisher : C.Struik (Pty)ltd 1973</ref>\n\nFrom then on, the island's Port de Warwick was used by the Dutch as a stopover after long months at sea. In 1606, two expeditions came for the first time to what would later become [[Port Louis|Port-Louis]] in the northwest part of the island. The expedition, consisting of eleven ships and 1,357 men under the orders of Admiral Corneille, came into the bay, which they named \"Rade des Tortues\" (literally meaning \"Harbor of the Tortoises\") because of the great number of terrestrial tortoises they found there.<ref>[[Auguste Toussaint]], ''Histoire des \u00eeles Mascareignes'', p. 24</ref>  From that date, Dutch sailors shifted their choice to Rade des Tortues as a harbor.\n\nIn 1615, the shipwreck and death of governor [[Pieter Both]], who was coming back from India with four richly laden ships in the bay, led Dutch sailors to consider the route as cursed, and they tried to avoid it as much as possible. In the meantime, the British and the Danes were beginning to make incursions into the Indian Ocean. Those who landed on the island freely cut and took with them the precious heartwood of the [[ebony]] trees, then found in profusion all over the island.\n\n[[Netherlands|Dutch]] colonization started in 1638 and ended in 1710, with a brief interruption between 1658 and 1666. Numerous governors were appointed, but continuous hardships such as cyclones, droughts, pest infestations, lack of food, and illnesses finally took their toll, and the island was definitively abandoned in 1710.\n\nThe island was not permanently inhabited for the first forty years after its \"discovery\" by the Dutch, but in 1638 [[Cornelius Gooyer]] established the first permanent Dutch settlement in Mauritius with a garrison of twenty-five. He thus became the first governor of the island. In 1639, thirty more men came to reinforce the Dutch colony. Gooyer was instructed to develop the commercial potential of the island, but he did nothing of the sort, so he was recalled. His successor was [[Adriaan van der Stel]], who began the development in earnest, developing the export of [[ebony]] wood. For that purpose, van der Stel brought 105 Malagasy slaves to the island.<ref>Dr A. Satteeanund Peerthum, Resistance Aga\nSlavery, 1989, in ''Slavery in the South West Indian Ocean'', MGI, p. 25</ref> Within the first week, about sixty slaves were able to escape into the forests; about twenty of them were recaptured.\n\nIn 1644, the islanders were faced with many months of hardships, due to delayed shipment of supplies, bad harvests, and cyclones. During those months, the colonists could only rely on their own ability to feed themselves by fishing and hunting. Nonetheless, van der Stel secured the shipment of 95 more slaves from Madagascar, before being transferred to Ceylon. His replacement was [[Jacob van der Meersh]]. In 1645, the latter brought in 108 more Malagasy slaves. Van der Meersh left Mauritius in September 1648 and was replaced by [[Reinier Por]].\n\nIn 1652, more hardships befell the inhabitants, colonists and slaves alike. The population was then about a hundred people. The continuing hardships affected the commercial potential of the island and a pullout was ordered in 1657. On 16 July 1658, almost all the inhabitants left the island, except for a ship's boy and two slaves who had taken shelter in the forests.<ref>Albert Pitot, ''T\u2019Eyland Mauritius, Esquisses Historiques (1598\u20131710)'' 1905, p. 116</ref> Thus the first attempt at colonization by the Dutch ended badly.\n\nIn 1664, a second attempt was made, but this one also ended badly as the men chosen for the job abandoned their sick commander, [[van Niewland]], without proper treatment, and he would die.\n\nFrom 1666 to 1669, [[Dirk Jansz Smient]] administered the new colony at Port de Warwick, with the cutting down and export of ebony trees as the main activity. When Dirk Jansz Smient left, he was replaced by [[George Frederik Wreeden]], who died in 1672, drowned with five other colonists during a reconnaissance expedition. His replacement would be [[Hubert Hugo]]. Hugo was a man of vision and wanted to make the island into an agricultural colony. His vision was not shared by his superiors, and he eventually had to abandon the attempt.\n\n[[Issac Johannes Lamotius]] became the new governor when Hugo left in 1677. Lamotius governed until 1692, when he was deported to Batavia for judgment for persecuting a colonist whose wife had refused his courtship. A new governor, [[Roelof Diodati]], was then appointed in 1692. Diodati faced many problems in his attempts to develop the island, such as cyclones, pest infestations, cattle illnesses, and droughts. Discouraged, Diodati eventually gave up and his replacement would be [[Abraham Momber van de Velde]]. The latter fared no better, but remained the last Dutch governor of the island until it was abandoned in 1710.\n\nSlaves were not particularly well treated by the colonists, and revolts or the act of organizing one were severely repressed and punished. Some punishments consisted of amputation of various parts of the body and exposure in the open air for a day as example to others, eventually culminating in condemned slaves\u2019 execution at sunset.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}}\n\nLegacy of the Dutch in Mauritius include:\n*Providing the name for the country and for many regions over the whole island.

He named the island \"Isle de France\", but it was only in 1721 that the French started their occupation. However, it was only from 1735, with the arrival of the French governor, [Mah\u00e9 de La Bourdonnais], that \"Isle de France\" started developing effectively.\nMah\u00e9 de La Bourdonnais planted spices such as pepper,cinamons and cloves at \"Jardin Pamplemousses\".\nMah\u00e9 de La Bourdonnais established [[Port Louis]] as a naval base and a shipbuilding centre. Under his governorship, numerous buildings were built, a number of which still stand today: part of Government House, the [[Chateau de Mon Plaisir]] at [[Pamplemousses]] and the Line Barracks. The island was under the administration of the [[French East India Company]] which maintained its presence until 1767.\n\nIn 1806 the Governor General, [[Charles Mathieu Isidore Decaen]], created the city of [[Mah\u00e9bourg]], named in honour of Mah\u00e9 de La Bourdonnais. It was originally known as Bourg Mah\u00e9. From that year until 1810, the island was in charge of officials appointed by the French Government, except for a brief period during the [[French Revolution]], when the inhabitants set up a government virtually independent of France.\n\n{{further information|Invasion of Isle de France}}\nDuring the [[Napoleonic wars]], the \"Isle de France\" had become a base from which French [[Privateer|corsairs]] organised successful raids on British commercial ships. The raids continued until 1810 when a strong British expedition was sent to capture the island. A preliminary attack was foiled [[Battle of Grand Port|at Grand Port]] in August 1810, but the main attack launched in December of the same year from [[Rodrigues (island)|Rodrigues]], which had been captured during the same year, was successful. Rodrigues was before visited for only fresh water and food by the British In 1809. The British landed in large numbers in the north of the island and rapidly overpowered the French, who capitulated. By the Treaty of Paris in 1814, the \"Isle de France\" which was renamed ''Mauritius'' was ceded to Great Britain, together with Rodrigues and the [[Seychelles]]. In the act of capitulation, the British guaranteed that they would respect the languages, the customs, the laws and the traditions of the inhabitants.\n\n==British rule (1810\u20131968)==\n[[File:Combat de Grand Port mg 9425.jpg|thumb|[[Battle of Grand Port]] (1810) by [[Pierre Julien Gilbert]]]]\n[[File:Curepipe Cerfs.jpg|thumb|Deer-hunting in [[Curepipe]], circa 1900]]\n{{main article|British Mauritius}}\nDespite the only French naval victory (during the Napoleonic Wars) of [[Battle of Grand Port]] on 19 and 20 August 1810 by a fleet commanded by [[Pierre Fran\u00e7ois Etienne Bouvet de Maisonneuve|Pierre Bouvet]], [[Invasion of \u00cele de France|Mauritius was captured]] on 3 December 1810 by the British under [[Commodore (rank)|Commodore]] [[Josias Rowley]]. Their possession of the island was confirmed four years later by the [[Treaty of Paris (1814)]]. French institutions, including the [[Napoleonic code]] of law, were maintained. The [[French language]] was at that moment still used more widely than English.\n\nThe British administration, which began with [[Robert Townsend Farquhar]] as [[Governor of British Mauritius|governor]], was followed by rapid social and economic changes. One of the most important events was the abolition of slavery on 1 February 1835. The planters received a compensation of two million pounds sterling for the loss of their slaves which had been imported from Africa and Madagascar during the French occupation.\n[[George Bowen|Sir George Ferguson Bowen]] was [[Governor of British Mauritius|governor]] from 1879 to 1883.\n\nMauritian [[Creole peoples|Creole]]s trace their origins to the plantation owners and slaves who were brought to work the sugar fields. \nWhen [[slavery]] was abolished on 1 February 1835, an attempt was made to secure a cheap source of adaptable labour for intensive sugar plantations in Mauritius. [[Indenture]]d labour began with Chinese, Malay, African and Malagasy labourers, but ultimately, it was India which supplied the much needed laborers to Mauritius. This period of intensive use of Indian labour took place during [[British rule]], with many brutal episodes and a long struggle by the indentured for respect. The term applied to the indentured during this period, and which has since become a derogatory term for Mauritians of Asian descent, was [[Coolie]]. The island soon became the key-point in the trade of indentured laborers, as thousands of Indians set forth from [[Kolkata|Calcutta]] or [[Karikal]];  not only did they modify the social, political and economic physiognomies of the island, but some also went farther, to the West Indies.\n\n[[Indo-Mauritian]]s are descended from Indian immigrants who arrived in the 19th century via the [[Aapravasi Ghat]] in order to work as indentured laborers after slavery was abolished in 1835. Included in the Indo-Mauritian community are [[Muslim]]s (about 17% of the population) from the Indian subcontinent. The [[Franco-Mauritian]] elite controls nearly all of the large sugar estates and is active in business and banking. As the Indian population became numerically dominant and the voting franchise was extended, political power shifted from the Franco-Mauritians and their Creole allies to the Indo-Mauritians.\n\nThe meeting of a mosaic of people from India, China, Africa and Europe began a process of hybridisation and [[intercultural]] frictions and dialogues, which poet [[Khal Torabully]] has termed \"coolitude\".<ref>Khal Torabully, ''Coolitude : An Anthology of the Indian Labour Diaspora'' (with Marina Carter, Anthem Press, London, 2002) {{ISBN|1-84331-003-1}}</ref> This social reality is a major reference for [[Cultural identity|identity]] opened to [[Alterity|otherness]] and is widely used in [[Mauritius]] where it represents a [[humanism]] of [[Multiculturalism|diversity]].\n\nConflicts arose between the Indian community (mostly sugarcane labourers) and the Franco-Mauritians in the 1920s, leading to several{{spaced ndash}}mainly Indian{{spaced ndash}}deaths. Following this, the [[Mauritius Labour Party]] was founded in 1936 by [[Maurice Cure]] to safeguard the interest of the labourers. Cure was succeeded a year later by [[Emmanuel Anquetil]] who tried to gain the support of the port workers. After his death, [[Guy Rozemont]] took over the leadership of the party.\n\nThe Mauritius Territorial Force comprising [[coastal artillery]] and infantry formations was created in 1934.<ref>https://www.amazon.co.uk/Mauritius-Territorial-Force-Regulations-1934/dp/B0014TXSYG</ref> Due to the escalation of the Second World War, the force expanded to comprise two battalions.<ref>p. 325 Jackson, Ashley ''The British Empire and the Second World War'', A&C Black, 9 Mar 2006</ref> It was renamed the '''Mauritius Regiment''' in 1943.\nThe 1st Battalion with a strength of 1,000 men landed in (Diego Suarez) on December 1943 to relieve Imperial Forces who had invaded and seized the island from [[Vichy France]] in the 1942 [[Battle of Madagascar]].  Shortly after landing the battalion mutinied due to protests at their conditions and the breaking of their guarantee they would not leave Mauritius.  Disarmed by the [[King's African Rifles]], 300 soldiers were arrested and 500 soldiers tried but only 6 remained imprisoned by 1946<ref>pp. 121-122 Killingray, David &  Plaut, Martin ''Fighting for Britain: African Soldiers in the Second World War'' Boydell & Brewer Ltd, 2012</ref>\nThere was also a home guard formation, the Mauritius Defence Force of 2,000 men and a naval Coastal Defence Force<ref>p.325 Jackson</ref>\n\n==Independence (1968)==\n[[File:Flag of Mauritius.svg|thumb|[[Flag of Mauritius]] (1968)]]\n{{main article|Mauritius (1968\u20131992)}}\nElections in 1947 for the newly created Legislative Assembly marked Mauritius's first steps toward self-rule, and were won by the Labour Party, headed by Guy Rozemont. It was the first time the elite Francophones were ousted from power.\n\nAn independence campaign gained momentum after 1961, when the British agreed to permit additional self-government and eventual independence. A coalition composed of the [[Mauritian Labour Party]] (MLP), the [[Muslim Committee of Action]] (CAM) of Sir [[Abdool Razack Mohamed]], and the [[Independent Forward Bloc]] (IFB){{spaced ndash}}a traditionalist Hindu party{{spaced ndash}}won a majority in the 1967 Legislative Assembly election, despite opposition from Franco-Mauritian and Creole supporters of [[Ga\u00ebtan Duval|Sir Gaetan Duval QC]]'s and Jules Koenig's [[Mauritian Social Democratic Party]] (PMSD).\n\nThe contest was interpreted locally as a referendum on independence. The election was won by a small margin. Constituency No. 15 was key to the victory by the pro-independence coalition. The MLP led alliance was able to win this constituency only due to the support of the CAM. Sir [[Seewoosagur Ramgoolam]], a very popular medical practitioner who tremendously helped and supported the poor and the workers community, MLP leader and chief minister in the colonial government, became the first prime minister after independence, on 12 March 1968. This event was preceded by a period of communal strife, brought under control with assistance from British troops. The communal strife that preceded independence led to around 300 deaths.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://lemauricien.com/mauricien/index.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=2007-08-31 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070831102835/http://lemauricien.com/mauricien/index.html |archive-date=2007-08-31 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n[[File:Royal Standard of Mauritius.svg|thumb|[[Queen's Personal Mauritian Flag]]]]\nBritish rule ended on 12 March 1968 with the [[Mauritius Independence Act 1968]]. The [[British monarch]], [[Elizabeth II]], remained nominal [[head of state]] as [[Queen of Mauritius]]. Her constitutional roles were delegated to the [[List of Governors-General of Mauritius|Governor-General of Mauritius]]. The last [[Governor of British Mauritius|governor]], [[John Shaw Rennie|Sir John Shaw Rennie]] served as the first governor-general until 27 August 1968.\n\nIn 1969, the [[Mouvement Militant Mauricien]] led by [[Paul B\u00e9renger]] and [[Heeralall Bhugaloo]] emerged. The MMM won its first election in a by election of constituency No. 5 by electing [[Dev Virasawmy]]. Until 1982, Sir [[Seewoosagur Ramgoolam]] was prime minister, his Labour Party in coalition with Duval's PMSD. In 1982, the coalition of ''Mouvement Militant Mauricien/Parti Socialiste Mauricien'' came to power in a landslide electoral victory, with [[Anerood Jugnauth|Sir Anerood Jugnauth QC]] as prime minister and [[Harish Boodhoo]] as the deputy prime minister. The coalition split in 1983, with Sir Anerood Jugnauth QC forming the ''Mouvement Socialiste Mauricien'' (MSM), which became the governing party, with Jugnauth as prime minister. Sir Seewoosagur Ramgoolam subsequently became governor-general.\n\nAfter Sir Seewoosagur's death, first Sir [[Satcam Boolell]], then Sir Seewoosagur's unique son, Dr. [[Navin Ramgoolam]], a charismatic leader, a medical practitioner and holder of a degree in law, succeeded him as leaders of the MLP. However, the MLP and PMSD were defeated at the 1991 election, which saw Sir Anerood Jugnauth QC re-elected under a MMM/MSM government.\n\nThe Republic of Mauritius was proclaimed on 12 March 1992. Following the abolition of the monarchy, the last Governor General of Mauritius, Sir Veerasamy Ringadoo became the first [[President of Mauritius]].\n\n===Republic (1992)===\nIn December 1991, the Constitution was amended to make Mauritius a republic within the Commonwealth. Mauritius became a republic on 12 March 1992, with the last governor general, [[Veerasamy Ringadoo|Sir Veerasamy Ringadoo]], as interim [[President of Mauritius|president]]. He was succeeded by [[Cassam Uteem]] on 30 June 1992.\n\n[[Dr. Navin Ramgoolam]] led a MLP-MMM coalition to victory at the 1995 general elections, replacing Sir Aneerood Jugnauth QC as prime minister, a post the latter had occupied for 13 years. The governing coalition split in 1997, with the MMM going back to the Opposition and Dr. Navin Ramgoolam staying on as prime minister.\n\nAt the next elections in 2000, Sir Anerood Jugnauth's MSM, in coalition with Paul B\u00e9renger's MMM was returned to power, with Sir Anerood Jugnauth QC appointed as prime minister. He subsequently retired as prime minister after 3 years and assumed the office of president. For the remaining time of the elected government the prime minister's post was filled by Paul B\u00e9renger. At the 2005 general elections, the MLP-led Alliance Sociale coalition won the elections, and Dr. Navin Ramgoolam became prime minister while Sir Anerood Jugnauth QC remained the president. The 2010 general elections saw the victory of a MLP-MSM-PMSD coalition (known as \"L'Alliance de l'Avenir\") and the maintaining of Dr. Navin Ramgoolam as prime minister. A year or so later, Sir Anerood Jugnauth QC left the presidency and was replaced by Kailash Purryag, an attorney at law and politician, who has served the country as senior minister on many occasions under the leadership of Dr. Navin Ramgoolam.\nThe 2014 general elections saw the victory of a MSM-PMSD-ML coalition (known as \"L'alliance Lepep\") and Sir Aneerood Jugnauth became Prime Minister while Kailash Prayag remained the president until 2016 when Mrs Ameena Gureeb Fakim became the first female president.\n\n==See also==\n*[[History of Africa]]\n*[[History of Southern Africa]]\n*[[Politics of Mauritius]]\n*[[List of Prime Ministers of Mauritius]]\n*[[Governor of Mauritius (disambiguation)|Colonial governors of Mauritius]]\n* Port Louis [[Port Louis#History|history]] and [[Timeline of Port Louis|timeline]]\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.mauritiusmuseums.com/ The Mauritius Museums Council], a body corporate under the aegis of the Ministry of Arts and Culture\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20070720003439/http://www.mauritius.travel.online.fr/history.htm History of Mauritius island]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20090602111905/http://www.worldstatesmen.org/Mauritius.htm WorldStatesmen- Mauritius]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20060706102922/http://www.oldmaps.mu/History/French.htm History of Mauritius in the French period]\n*[https://archive.today/20121217150147/https://picasaweb.google.com/MuseedelaPetiteCollection Gallery detailing the history of Mauritius]\n\n{{Navboxes\n|list =\n{{Mauritius topics}}\n{{History of Africa}}\n{{Dutch colonies|East India}}\n{{French overseas empire}}\n}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:History Of Mauritius}}\n<!--Categories-->\n[[Category:History of Mauritius| ]]\n", "text_old": "{{More citations needed|date=August 2009}}\n{{History of Mauritius}}\nThe known '''history of Mauritius''' begins with its discovery by [[Arabs]], followed by [[Europeans]] and its appearance on maps in the early 16th century.

Mauritius and surrounding islands were known as the Mascarene Islands [[Ilhas Mascarenhas]]  after Pedro Mascarenhas.

The expedition ran into a [[cyclone]] and was forced to change course. Thus, the ship ''Cirne'' of the captain [[Diogo Fernandes Pereira]], came into view of R\u00e9union island on 9 February 1507. They called the island \"Santa Apolonia\" (\"[[Saint Apollonia]]\") in honor of that day's saint. Mauritius was encountered during the same expedition and received the name of \"Cirne\" and Rodrigues that of \"Diogo Fernandes\".<ref>Jacques Auber, ''Histoire de l\u2019oc\u00e9an Indien'', 1955, p. 233</ref> Five years later, the islands were visited by [[Pedro Mascarenhas|Dom Pedro de Mascarenhas]]<ref>[[Auguste Toussaint]] attributes the discovery of Mauritius to Mascarenhas whereas Albert Pitot hesitates to do so.

The Portuguese took no interest in these isolated islands. They were already established in Asia in [[Goa]], on the coast of Malabar, on the island of Ceylon (now [[Sri Lanka]]) and on the Malaysian coast.\n\nTheir main African base was in [[Mozambique]], therefore the [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] navigators preferred to use the [[Mozambique Channel]] to go to India.

The eight ships ran into foul weather after passing the Cape of Good Hope, and were separated. Three found their way to the northeast of [[Madagascar]], while the remaining five regrouped and sailed in a southeasterly direction. On 17 September, the five ships under the orders of Admiral van Warwyck came into view of Mauritius. On 20 September, they entered a sheltered bay which they named \"Port de Warwick\" (now known as \"Grand Port\"). They landed and decided to name the island \"Prins Mauritz van Nassaueiland,\" after the son of [[William the Silent]], [[Maurice,_Prince_of_Orange|Prince Maurits]] ([[Latin]] version: Mauritius) of the [[House of Nassau]], the ''[[stadtholder]]'' of most of the [[Dutch Republic]], and after the main vessel of the fleet, the \"Mauritius\". From that time, only the name Mauritius has remained. On 2 October, the ships again took to the sea towards Bantam.\nSome of the descendants of William of Orange through the female line reside in Mauritius, including Jill Holloway, a distinguished businesswoman, marine journalist and writer.\n<ref>Charles John Smythe Pioneer, Premier and Administrator of Natal Daphne Child Publisher : C.Struik (Pty)ltd 1973</ref>\n\nFrom then on, the island's Port de Warwick was used by the Dutch as a stopover after long months at sea. In 1606, two expeditions came for the first time to what would later become [[Port Louis|Port-Louis]] in the northwest part of the island. The expedition, consisting of eleven ships and 1,357 men under the orders of Admiral Corneille, came into the bay, which they named \"Rade des Tortues\" (literally meaning \"Harbor of the Tortoises\") because of the great number of terrestrial tortoises they found there.<ref>[[Auguste Toussaint]], ''Histoire des \u00eeles Mascareignes'', p. 24</ref>  From that date, Dutch sailors shifted their choice to Rade des Tortues as a harbor.\n\nIn 1615, the shipwreck and death of governor [[Pieter Both]], who was coming back from India with four richly laden ships in the bay, led Dutch sailors to consider the route as cursed, and they tried to avoid it as much as possible. In the meantime, the British and the Danes were beginning to make incursions into the Indian Ocean. Those who landed on the island freely cut and took with them the precious heartwood of the [[ebony]] trees, then found in profusion all over the island.\n\n[[Netherlands|Dutch]] colonization started in 1638 and ended in 1710, with a brief interruption between 1658 and 1666. Numerous governors were appointed, but continuous hardships such as cyclones, droughts, pest infestations, lack of food, and illnesses finally took their toll, and the island was definitively abandoned in 1710.\n\nThe island was not permanently inhabited for the first forty years after its \"discovery\" by the Dutch, but in 1638 [[Cornelius Gooyer]] established the first permanent Dutch settlement in Mauritius with a garrison of twenty-five. He thus became the first governor of the island. In 1639, thirty more men came to reinforce the Dutch colony. Gooyer was instructed to develop the commercial potential of the island, but he did nothing of the sort, so he was recalled. His successor was [[Adriaan van der Stel]], who began the development in earnest, developing the export of [[ebony]] wood. For that purpose, van der Stel brought 105 Malagasy slaves to the island.<ref>Dr A. Satteeanund Peerthum, Resistance Aga\nSlavery, 1989, in ''Slavery in the South West Indian Ocean'', MGI, p. 25</ref> Within the first week, about sixty slaves were able to escape into the forests; about twenty of them were recaptured.\n\nIn 1644, the islanders were faced with many months of hardships, due to delayed shipment of supplies, bad harvests, and cyclones. During those months, the colonists could only rely on their own ability to feed themselves by fishing and hunting. Nonetheless, van der Stel secured the shipment of 95 more slaves from Madagascar, before being transferred to Ceylon. His replacement was [[Jacob van der Meersh]]. In 1645, the latter brought in 108 more Malagasy slaves. Van der Meersh left Mauritius in September 1648 and was replaced by [[Reinier Por]].\n\nIn 1652, more hardships befell the inhabitants, colonists and slaves alike. The population was then about a hundred people. The continuing hardships affected the commercial potential of the island and a pullout was ordered in 1657. On 16 July 1658, almost all the inhabitants left the island, except for a ship's boy and two slaves who had taken shelter in the forests.<ref>Albert Pitot, ''T\u2019Eyland Mauritius, Esquisses Historiques (1598\u20131710)'' 1905, p. 116</ref> Thus the first attempt at colonization by the Dutch ended badly.\n\nIn 1664, a second attempt was made, but this one also ended badly as the men chosen for the job abandoned their sick commander, [[van Niewland]], without proper treatment, and he would die.\n\nFrom 1666 to 1669, [[Dirk Jansz Smient]] administered the new colony at Port de Warwick, with the cutting down and export of ebony trees as the main activity. When Dirk Jansz Smient left, he was replaced by [[George Frederik Wreeden]], who died in 1672, drowned with five other colonists during a reconnaissance expedition. His replacement would be [[Hubert Hugo]]. Hugo was a man of vision and wanted to make the island into an agricultural colony. His vision was not shared by his superiors, and he eventually had to abandon the attempt.\n\n[[Issac Johannes Lamotius]] became the new governor when Hugo left in 1677. Lamotius governed until 1692, when he was deported to Batavia for judgment for persecuting a colonist whose wife had refused his courtship. A new governor, [[Roelof Diodati]], was then appointed in 1692. Diodati faced many problems in his attempts to develop the island, such as cyclones, pest infestations, cattle illnesses, and droughts. Discouraged, Diodati eventually gave up and his replacement would be [[Abraham Momber van de Velde]]. The latter fared no better, but remained the last Dutch governor of the island until it was abandoned in 1710.\n\nSlaves were not particularly well treated by the colonists, and revolts or the act of organizing one were severely repressed and punished. Some punishments consisted of amputation of various parts of the body and exposure in the open air for a day as example to others, eventually culminating in condemned slaves\u2019 execution at sunset.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}}\n\nLegacy of the Dutch in Mauritius include:\n*Providing the name for the country and for many regions over the whole island.

He named the island \"Isle de France\", but it was only in 1721 that the French started their occupation. However, it was only from 1735, with the arrival of the French governor, [Mah\u00e9 de La Bourdonnais], that \"Isle de France\" started developing effectively.\nMah\u00e9 de La Bourdonnais planted spices such as pepper,cinamons and cloves at \"Jardin Pamplemousses\".\nMah\u00e9 de La Bourdonnais established [[Port Louis]] as a naval base and a shipbuilding centre. Under his governorship, numerous buildings were built, a number of which still stand today: part of Government House, the [[Chateau de Mon Plaisir]] at [[Pamplemousses]] and the Line Barracks. The island was under the administration of the [[French East India Company]] which maintained its presence until 1767.\n\nIn 1806 the Governor General, [[Charles Mathieu Isidore Decaen]], created the city of [[Mah\u00e9bourg]], named in honour of Mah\u00e9 de La Bourdonnais. It was originally known as Bourg Mah\u00e9. From that year until 1810, the island was in charge of officials appointed by the French Government, except for a brief period during the [[French Revolution]], when the inhabitants set up a government virtually independent of France.\n\n{{further information|Invasion of Isle de France}}\nDuring the [[Napoleonic wars]], the \"Isle de France\" had become a base from which French [[Privateer|corsairs]] organised successful raids on British commercial ships. The raids continued until 1810 when a strong British expedition was sent to capture the island. A preliminary attack was foiled [[Battle of Grand Port|at Grand Port]] in August 1810, but the main attack launched in December of the same year from [[Rodrigues (island)|Rodrigues]], which had been captured during the same year, was successful. Rodrigues was before visited for only fresh water and food by the British In 1809. The British landed in large numbers in the north of the island and rapidly overpowered the French, who capitulated. By the Treaty of Paris in 1814, the \"Isle de France\" which was renamed ''Mauritius'' was ceded to Great Britain, together with Rodrigues and the [[Seychelles]]. In the act of capitulation, the British guaranteed that they would respect the languages, the customs, the laws and the traditions of the inhabitants.\n\n==British rule (1810\u20131968)==\n[[File:Combat de Grand Port mg 9425.jpg|thumb|[[Battle of Grand Port]] (1810) by [[Pierre Julien Gilbert]]]]\n[[File:Curepipe Cerfs.jpg|thumb|Deer-hunting in [[Curepipe]], circa 1900]]\n{{main article|British Mauritius}}\nDespite the only French naval victory (during the Napoleonic Wars) of [[Battle of Grand Port]] on 19 and 20 August 1810 by a fleet commanded by [[Pierre Fran\u00e7ois Etienne Bouvet de Maisonneuve|Pierre Bouvet]], [[Invasion of \u00cele de France|Mauritius was captured]] on 3 December 1810 by the British under [[Commodore (rank)|Commodore]] [[Josias Rowley]]. Their possession of the island was confirmed four years later by the [[Treaty of Paris (1814)]]. French institutions, including the [[Napoleonic code]] of law, were maintained. The [[French language]] was at that moment still used more widely than English.\n\nThe British administration, which began with [[Robert Townsend Farquhar]] as [[Governor of British Mauritius|governor]], was followed by rapid social and economic changes. One of the most important events was the abolition of slavery on 1 February 1835. The planters received a compensation of two million pounds sterling for the loss of their slaves which had been imported from Africa and Madagascar during the French occupation.\n[[George Bowen|Sir George Ferguson Bowen]] was [[Governor of British Mauritius|governor]] from 1879 to 1883.\n\nMauritian [[Creole peoples|Creole]]s trace their origins to the plantation owners and slaves who were brought to work the sugar fields. \nWhen [[slavery]] was abolished on 1 February 1835, an attempt was made to secure a cheap source of adaptable labour for intensive sugar plantations in Mauritius. [[Indenture]]d labour began with Chinese, Malay, African and Malagasy labourers, but ultimately, it was India which supplied the much needed laborers to Mauritius. This period of intensive use of Indian labour took place during [[British rule]], with many brutal episodes and a long struggle by the indentured for respect. The term applied to the indentured during this period, and which has since become a derogatory term for Mauritians of Asian descent, was [[Coolie]]. The island soon became the key-point in the trade of indentured laborers, as thousands of Indians set forth from [[Kolkata|Calcutta]] or [[Karikal]];  not only did they modify the social, political and economic physiognomies of the island, but some also went farther, to the West Indies.\n\n[[Indo-Mauritian]]s are descended from Indian immigrants who arrived in the 19th century via the [[Aapravasi Ghat]] in order to work as indentured laborers after slavery was abolished in 1835. Included in the Indo-Mauritian community are [[Muslim]]s (about 17% of the population) from the Indian subcontinent. The [[Franco-Mauritian]] elite controls nearly all of the large sugar estates and is active in business and banking. As the Indian population became numerically dominant and the voting franchise was extended, political power shifted from the Franco-Mauritians and their Creole allies to the Indo-Mauritians.\n\nThe meeting of a mosaic of people from India, China, Africa and Europe began a process of hybridisation and [[intercultural]] frictions and dialogues, which poet [[Khal Torabully]] has termed \"coolitude\".<ref>Khal Torabully, ''Coolitude : An Anthology of the Indian Labour Diaspora'' (with Marina Carter, Anthem Press, London, 2002) {{ISBN|1-84331-003-1}}</ref> This social reality is a major reference for [[Cultural identity|identity]] opened to [[Alterity|otherness]] and is widely used in [[Mauritius]] where it represents a [[humanism]] of [[Multiculturalism|diversity]].\n\nConflicts arose between the Indian community (mostly sugarcane labourers) and the Franco-Mauritians in the 1920s, leading to several{{spaced ndash}}mainly Indian{{spaced ndash}}deaths. Following this, the [[Mauritius Labour Party]] was founded in 1936 by [[Maurice Cure]] to safeguard the interest of the labourers. Cure was succeeded a year later by [[Emmanuel Anquetil]] who tried to gain the support of the port workers. After his death, [[Guy Rozemont]] took over the leadership of the party.\n\nThe Mauritius Territorial Force comprising [[coastal artillery]] and infantry formations was created in 1934.<ref>https://www.amazon.co.uk/Mauritius-Territorial-Force-Regulations-1934/dp/B0014TXSYG</ref> Due to the escalation of the Second World War, the force expanded to comprise two battalions.<ref>p. 325 Jackson, Ashley ''The British Empire and the Second World War'', A&C Black, 9 Mar 2006</ref> It was renamed the '''Mauritius Regiment''' in 1943.\nThe 1st Battalion with a strength of 1,000 men landed in (Diego Suarez) on December 1943 to relieve Imperial Forces who had invaded and seized the island from [[Vichy France]] in the 1942 [[Battle of Madagascar]].  Shortly after landing the battalion mutinied due to protests at their conditions and the breaking of their guarantee they would not leave Mauritius.  Disarmed by the [[King's African Rifles]], 300 soldiers were arrested and 500 soldiers tried but only 6 remained imprisoned by 1946<ref>pp. 121-122 Killingray, David &  Plaut, Martin ''Fighting for Britain: African Soldiers in the Second World War'' Boydell & Brewer Ltd, 2012</ref>\nThere was also a home guard formation, the Mauritius Defence Force of 2,000 men and a naval Coastal Defence Force<ref>p.325 Jackson</ref>\n\n==Independence (1968)==\n[[File:Flag of Mauritius.svg|thumb|[[Flag of Mauritius]] (1968)]]\n{{main article|Mauritius (1968\u20131992)}}\nElections in 1947 for the newly created Legislative Assembly marked Mauritius's first steps toward self-rule, and were won by the Labour Party, headed by Guy Rozemont. It was the first time the elite Francophones were ousted from power.\n\nAn independence campaign gained momentum after 1961, when the British agreed to permit additional self-government and eventual independence. A coalition composed of the [[Mauritian Labour Party]] (MLP), the [[Muslim Committee of Action]] (CAM) of Sir [[Abdool Razack Mohamed]], and the [[Independent Forward Bloc]] (IFB){{spaced ndash}}a traditionalist Hindu party{{spaced ndash}}won a majority in the 1967 Legislative Assembly election, despite opposition from Franco-Mauritian and Creole supporters of [[Ga\u00ebtan Duval|Sir Gaetan Duval QC]]'s and Jules Koenig's [[Mauritian Social Democratic Party]] (PMSD).\n\nThe contest was interpreted locally as a referendum on independence. The election was won by a small margin. Constituency No. 15 was key to the victory by the pro-independence coalition. The MLP led alliance was able to win this constituency only due to the support of the CAM. Sir [[Seewoosagur Ramgoolam]], a very popular medical practitioner who tremendously helped and supported the poor and the workers community, MLP leader and chief minister in the colonial government, became the first prime minister after independence, on 12 March 1968. This event was preceded by a period of communal strife, brought under control with assistance from British troops. The communal strife that preceded independence led to around 300 deaths.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://lemauricien.com/mauricien/index.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=2007-08-31 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070831102835/http://lemauricien.com/mauricien/index.html |archive-date=2007-08-31 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n[[File:Royal Standard of Mauritius.svg|thumb|[[Queen's Personal Mauritian Flag]]]]\nBritish rule ended on 12 March 1968 with the [[Mauritius Independence Act 1968]]. The [[British monarch]], [[Elizabeth II]], remained nominal [[head of state]] as [[Queen of Mauritius]]. Her constitutional roles were delegated to the [[List of Governors-General of Mauritius|Governor-General of Mauritius]]. The last [[Governor of British Mauritius|governor]], [[John Shaw Rennie|Sir John Shaw Rennie]] served as the first governor-general until 27 August 1968.\n\nIn 1969, the [[Mouvement Militant Mauricien]] led by [[Paul B\u00e9renger]] and [[Heeralall Bhugaloo]] emerged. The MMM won its first election in a by election of constituency No. 5 by electing [[Dev Virasawmy]]. Until 1982, Sir [[Seewoosagur Ramgoolam]] was prime minister, his Labour Party in coalition with Duval's PMSD. In 1982, the coalition of ''Mouvement Militant Mauricien/Parti Socialiste Mauricien'' came to power in a landslide electoral victory, with [[Anerood Jugnauth|Sir Anerood Jugnauth QC]] as prime minister and [[Harish Boodhoo]] as the deputy prime minister. The coalition split in 1983, with Sir Anerood Jugnauth QC forming the ''Mouvement Socialiste Mauricien'' (MSM), which became the governing party, with Jugnauth as prime minister. Sir Seewoosagur Ramgoolam subsequently became governor-general.\n\nAfter Sir Seewoosagur's death, first Sir [[Satcam Boolell]], then Sir Seewoosagur's unique son, Dr. [[Navin Ramgoolam]], a charismatic leader, a medical practitioner and holder of a degree in law, succeeded him as leaders of the MLP. However, the MLP and PMSD were defeated at the 1991 election, which saw Sir Anerood Jugnauth QC re-elected under a MMM/MSM government.\n\nThe Republic of Mauritius was proclaimed on 12 March 1992. Following the abolition of the monarchy, the last Governor General of Mauritius, Sir Veerasamy Ringadoo became the first [[President of Mauritius]].\n\n===Republic (1992)===\nIn December 1991, the Constitution was amended to make Mauritius a republic within the Commonwealth. Mauritius became a republic on 12 March 1992, with the last governor general, [[Veerasamy Ringadoo|Sir Veerasamy Ringadoo]], as interim [[President of Mauritius|president]]. He was succeeded by [[Cassam Uteem]] on 30 June 1992.\n\n[[Dr. Navin Ramgoolam]] led a MLP-MMM coalition to victory at the 1995 general elections, replacing Sir Aneerood Jugnauth QC as prime minister, a post the latter had occupied for 13 years. The governing coalition split in 1997, with the MMM going back to the Opposition and Dr. Navin Ramgoolam staying on as prime minister.\n\nAt the next elections in 2000, Sir Anerood Jugnauth's MSM, in coalition with Paul B\u00e9renger's MMM was returned to power, with Sir Anerood Jugnauth QC appointed as prime minister. He subsequently retired as prime minister after 3 years and assumed the office of president. For the remaining time of the elected government the prime minister's post was filled by Paul B\u00e9renger. At the 2005 general elections, the MLP-led Alliance Sociale coalition won the elections, and Dr. Navin Ramgoolam became prime minister while Sir Anerood Jugnauth QC remained the president. The 2010 general elections saw the victory of a MLP-MSM-PMSD coalition (known as \"L'Alliance de l'Avenir\") and the maintaining of Dr. Navin Ramgoolam as prime minister. A year or so later, Sir Anerood Jugnauth QC left the presidency and was replaced by Kailash Purryag, an attorney at law and politician, who has served the country as senior minister on many occasions under the leadership of Dr. Navin Ramgoolam.\nThe 2014 general elections saw the victory of a MSM-PMSD-ML coalition (known as \"L'alliance Lepep\") and Sir Aneerood Jugnauth became Prime Minister while Kailash Prayag remained the president until 2016 when Mrs Ameena Gureeb Fakim became the first female president.\n\n==See also==\n*[[History of Africa]]\n*[[History of Southern Africa]]\n*[[Politics of Mauritius]]\n*[[List of Prime Ministers of Mauritius]]\n*[[Governor of Mauritius (disambiguation)|Colonial governors of Mauritius]]\n* Port Louis [[Port Louis#History|history]] and [[Timeline of Port Louis|timeline]]\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.mauritiusmuseums.com/ The Mauritius Museums Council], a body corporate under the aegis of the Ministry of Arts and Culture\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20070720003439/http://www.mauritius.travel.online.fr/history.htm History of Mauritius island]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20090602111905/http://www.worldstatesmen.org/Mauritius.htm WorldStatesmen- Mauritius]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20060706102922/http://www.oldmaps.mu/History/French.htm History of Mauritius in the French period]\n*[https://archive.today/20121217150147/https://picasaweb.google.com/MuseedelaPetiteCollection Gallery detailing the history of Mauritius]\n\n{{Navboxes\n|list =\n{{Mauritius topics}}\n{{History of Africa}}\n{{Dutch colonies|East India}}\n{{French overseas empire}}\n}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:History Of Mauritius}}\n<!--Categories-->\n[[Category:History of Mauritius| ]]\n", "name_user": "Sinaloa", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eDiscovery", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Mauritius"}
