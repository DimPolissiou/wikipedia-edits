John Christian had eleven-years and his younger brother George Rudolf had only seven, the regency of the Duchies was taken by their mother, the Dowager Duchess Anna Maria (who held O\u0142awa as her [[dower]]). After Anna Maria's death in 1605, the regency was taken by the paternal aunt of the young Dukes (and only surviving sibling of the late Joachim Frederick), Elisabeth Magdalena of Brieg and her husband, [[Charles II, Duke of M\u00fcnsterberg-Oels|Charles II of Pod\u011bbrady]], Duke of [[Zi\u0119bice]]\u2013[[Ole\u015bnica]].\n\nDuring some time, John Christian live in [[Krosno Odrza\u0144skie]] ({{lang-de|Crossen an der Oder}}), where he met his first wife, Dorothea Sybille of Brandenburg.\n\n===Beginning of Rule===\nIn 1609 John Christian attained his majority and assumed the government. On 7 October of that year he paid homage to the [[Emperor Rudolf II]] in [[Wroc\u0142aw]]. In 1612 his younger brother George Rudolf was formally declared an adult. Then, the brothers decided to make the division of their lands: John Christian retained Brzeg, O\u0142awa, [[Strzelin]], [[Niemcza]], [[Kluczbork]] and [[Byczyna]], and George Rudolf came into possession of Legnica, Wo\u0142\u00f3w, [[Z\u0142otoryja]], [[Grodziec, Lower Silesian Voivodeship|Grod\u017aca]], [[Lubin]], [[Prochowice]], [[Wi\u0144sko]], [[W\u0105sosz]], [[Rycze\u0144]] and  [[Rudna, Lower Silesian Voivodeship|Rudna]].\n\n===Conversion to Calvinism===\nIn 1613 John Christian, then a [[Lutheran]], began to profess openly the [[Calvinism]].

Thanks to this, they could renewed the alliance of the Duchy of Legnica-Brzeg with the [[House of Hohenzollern]].\n\n===Thirty Years' War===\nIn 1617 [[Ferdinand II, Holy Roman Emperor|Ferdinand II of Habsburg]] was elected King of [[Bohemia]]. The new ruler, raised by the Jesuits, began immediately the [[Counter Reformation]]. The  Protestants were totally against his election to the Bohemisn throne, especially when it became clear that Ferdinand II had no intention to give them the tolerance guaranteed by Imperial Decree of the late Emperor Rudolf II. The conflict between the Bohemians and Ferdinand II deepened when the new King shown his aspirations for rule in the [[Absolutism (European history)|Absolutism]]. In the civil war started between the Bohemians and the Habsburgs, John Christian stood on the Bohemian side. With the insistence of [[John George of Brandenburg, Duke of Krnov]], his brother George Rudolf and his cousins, the Dukes of [[Ole\u015bnica]], [[Henry Wenceslaus of Pod\u011bbrady|Henry Wenceslaus]] and [[Karl Frederick of Pod\u011bbrady]] (later his son-in-law) and as ''General Prefect'' (Governor) of Silesia (a function held from him since 1617 onwards) he formed an army who, under the leadership of John George of Krnov went to Bohemia to help the insurgents. In 1619 the states of Bohemia announced the dethronement of Ferdinand II, and on 26 July was elected as new King of Bohemia [[Frederick V, Elector Palatine]], a strong Calvinism.\n\nJohn Christian was a strong supporter of the new King. After the election of Frederick V, he stood at the forefront of the national government of Silesia. On 27 February 1620 in [[Wroc\u0142aw]] the Silesian states paid tribute to Frederick V, during which the formula of the oath was given by the Duke of Brzeg. John Christian also worked in the diplomatic affairs on behalf of King-Elector. In Poland, he sought to raise more troops to support the civil war against the [[Habsburg]]s. Also, he made contacts with the Anti-Habsburg opposition in Hungary, where the King counted with the support of [[G\u00e1bor Bethlen]], Prince of [[Transylvania]]. In Silesia John Christian persuaded several nobles to join to the Anti-Habsburg side, promising military support. However, the cruelty and dictatorial government of Frederick V, the Silesians began to reject the Anti-Habsburg moods and they fading totally on 8 November 1620, when at the [[Battle of White Mountain]] were the Habsurg army severely defeated the Bohemian forces. One day after, Prague was occupied by the Habsburgs. Standing all the time faithfully at the side of Frederick V, John Christian urged to the Silesian states to adopt a tax on the continuation of the war. However, the following successful of Ferdinand II between the Princes who support the Elector crashed all his plans; on 23 December John Christian was finally defeated and fled to the court of [[George William, Elector of Brandenburg]]. The Silesian government entered immediately in negotiations with the winners. On 28 February 1621 in [[Dresden]], with the mediation of Elector [[John George I of Saxony]], the agreement was signed. The Silesian states sworn fidelity to the Emperor and break completely all relations with his enemies.

In 1632 the Saxon army entered in the Silesian states, including the Duchy of Brzeg. In the next year, at the Northwestern, came the Imperial army under the command of Hans Ulrich von Schaffgotsch, husband of John Christian's sister, Barbara Agnes. His troops entered in O\u0142awa and even took [[Strzelin]], but soon they had to withdraw. Nevertheless, the Imperial Army began to gain advantage and already in the autumn of 1633,  Silesia was free from the Anti-Habsburg armies. John Christian was accused of allowing the access of the Saxon armies to Brzeg; the Imperial troops invaded his Duchy, and the Duke, his family and court were forced to fled.

Brzeg, 19 March 1625), daughter of [[John George, Elector of Brandenburg]] by his third wife, Elisabeth of Anhalt, full-sister of John Christian's mother Anna Maria; in consequence, both spouses are first cousins. As a dowry, John Christian received 30,000 [[Thaler|taler]]s. On 30 December, the newlyweds came to [[Legnica]], where they lived for a year. On 6 December 1611 the couple moved to [[Brzeg]], where Dorothea Sybille remained until her death, thirteen years later. On 14 May 1625 her body was placed in the Church of St. Hedwig in Brzeg. They had thirteen children:\n#[[George III of Brieg|George III]] (b. Brzeg, 4 September 1611 - d. Brzeg, 4 July 1664).\n#Joachim (b. 20 December 1612 - d. 9 February 1613).\n#Henry (b. 3 February 1614 - d. 4 February 1614).\n#Ernest (b. 3 February 1614 - d. 4 February 1614), twin of Henry.\n#Anna Elisabeth (b. 23 March 1615 - d. 28 March 1616)\n#[[Louis IV of Legnica|Louis IV]] (b. Brzeg, 19 April 1616 - d. Legnica, 24 November 1663).\n#Rudolf (b. 6 April 1617 - d. 8 February 1633).\n#[[Christian, Duke of Brieg|Christian]] (b. O\u0142awa, 9 April 1618 - d. O\u0142awa, 28 February 1672).\n#August (b. 18 March 1619 - 12 March 1620).\n#Sibylle Margareta (b. Brzeg, 20 June 1620 - d. Gda\u0144sk, 26 June 1657), married on 23 October 1637 to Count [[Gerhard VII of D\u00f6nhoff]].\n#Dorothea (b. 16 August 1622 - d. 26 August 1622).\n#Agnes (b. 16 August 1622 - d. 3 September 1622), twin of Dorothea.\n#Sophia Magdalena (b. Brzeg, 14 June 1624 - d. O\u0142awa, 28 April 1660), married on 2 December 1642 to [[Charles Frederick I, Duke of M\u00fcnsterberg-Oels]], Duke of [[Zi\u0119bice]]\u2013[[Ole\u015bnica]].\n\nIn Brzeg on 13 September 1626 John Christian married secondly with Anna Hedwig (b. 13 January 1611 - d. Ostr\u00f3da, 16 July 1639), daughter of the Marshal Frederick of Sitzsch. The young bride (she had fifteen years) was a relative of [[John VI of Sitzsch]], who during 1600\u20131608 held the dignity of [[Bishop of Wroc\u0142aw]] and Imperial Governor of [[Silesia]]. However, the union was [[morganatic]] under the standards of the House of Piast, and for this the marriage was temporary a secret. A successfully arrangement on 24 June 1626 secured financially the eventual offspring of the union, but they were excluded from the succession of the Duchy of Legnica-Brzeg. Eighteen months later, on 7 December 1627, Emperor Ferdinand II gave an Imperial Diploma raised Anna Hedwig to the rank of Baroness ({{lang-de|Freiherrin}}), and two months later, on 18 February 1628, by a similar act in [[Regensburg]] the Emperor issued for the oldest son of John Christian and Anna Hedwig, August, the title of ''Baron of Legnica'' ({{lang-de|Freiherr von Liegnitz}}), and the same title was secured for the future children of the couple. Anna Hedwig died in Ostr\u00f3da six months before her husband, aged twenty-eight. She was buried there on 5 October. They had seven children:\n#[[Count August of Legnica|Baron August of Legnica]] (b. Brzeg, 21 August 1627 - d. Siebenhufen, 14 May 1679), created Count in 1664.\n#Baroness Dorothea Sybille of Legnica (b. 17 July 1628 - d. 18 June 1629).\n#A son (b. and d. 30 June 1629).\n#Baron Ernest of Legnica (b. 27 November 1630 - d. 16 March 1631).\n#Baron Sigismund of Legnica (b. Brzeg, 31 January 1632 - d. 14 July 1664), married on 1 October 1659 to Baroness Eva Eleonore of Bibran-Modlau (b. December 1644 - d. 6 July 1671). The union was childless.\n#Baroness Johanna Elisabeth of Legnica (b. Toru\u0144, 8 June 1634 - d. Swiatnik, 30 October 1673), married on 3 November 1651 to Baron Zdenko Howora Berka von Dub und Leipa.\n#Baroness Anna Christina of Legnica (b. Ostr\u00f3da, 18 October 1636 - d. Brzeg, 5 September 1642).\n\n==References==\n{{no footnotes|date=December 2016}}\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n*{{MLCC |warning=1 |url=http://fmg.ac/Projects/MedLands/SILESIA.htm#JohannChristiandied1639B |title-date= |title= SILESIA|date=August 2012}}\n*{{cite web |last=Marek |first=Miroslav |url=http://genealogy.euweb.cz/piast/piast6.html#KF3 |title= Complete Genealogy of the House of Piast: Silesia |publisher= Genealogy.EU}}{{Self-published source|date=August 2012}}{{Better source|date=August 2012}}\n*[https://archive.is/20121217224651/http://wwperson.informatik.uni-erlangen.de/cgi-bin/l3/LANG=engl/F=Johann@Christian/N=v.Schlesien-Brieg Genealogical database by Herbert Stoyan]\n*[http://www.heraldica.org/topics/royalty/g_morganat.htm#Brieg Morganatic and Unequal Marriages in German Law]\n\n{{s-start}}\n{{s-hou|[[House of Piast]]|28 August|1591|25 December|1639}}\n{{s-bef | rows=3 | before=[[Joachim Frederick of Brieg|Joachim Frederick]]}}\n{{s-ttl | title=[[Duchy of Silesia|Duke of Legnica]]|regent1=George Rudolf|years=1602\u20131612}}\n{{s-aft | rows=2 | after=[[George Rudolf of Legnica|George Rudolf]]}}\n|-\n{{s-ttl | title=[[Duchy of Silesia|Duke of Wo\u0142\u00f3w]]|regent1=George Rudolf|years=1602\u20131612}}\n|-\n{{s-ttl | title=[[Duchy of Silesia|Duke of Brzeg]]|regent1=George Rudolf|years1=1602-1612|years=1602\u20131633}}\n{{s-aft| rows=2 | after=[[George III of Brieg|George III]]|after2=[[Louis IV of Legnica|Louis IV]]|after3= [[Christian, Duke of Brieg|Christian]]}}\n{{s-bef|before=[[Anna Maria of Anhalt|Anna Maria]]}}\n{{s-ttl|title=[[Duchy of Silesia|Duke of O\u0142awa]]|years=1605\u20131633}}\n{{end}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:1591 births]]\n[[Category:1639 deaths]]\n[[Category:People from O\u0142awa]]\n[[Category:Dukes of Brzeg]]\n[[Category:Dukes of Legnica]]\n", "name_user": "ArisMethymna", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Christian_of_Brieg"}

He was influenced by their fast action, tight plots, economies of expression, fascinating characters with catchy memorable names, and speaking styles. Two of the earliest films he remembered watching both starred [[Dilip Kumar]]: [[Shaheed Latif]]'s ''[[Arzoo (1950 film)|Arzoo]]'' (1950) and [[Mehboob Khan]]'s ''[[Aan]]'' (1952). Other films that influenced him as a child include [[Bimal Roy]]'s ''[[Do Bigha Zameen]]'' (1953), [[Satyen Bose]]'s ''[[Jagriti]]'' (1954), ''[[Shree 420]]'' (1955) directed by [[Raj Kapoor]] and written by [[Khwaja Ahmad Abbas]], ''[[Munimji]]'' (1955) directed by [[Subodh Mukherjee]] and written by [[Nasir Hussain]], and Mehboob Khan's ''[[Mother India]]'' (1957).<ref>{{cite book |last1=Chaudhuri |first1=Diptakirti |title=Written by Salim-Javed: The Story of Hindi Cinema's Greatest Screenwriters |date=2015 |publisher=[[Penguin Books]] |isbn=9789352140084 |pages=26\u201327 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Cri9CgAAQBAJ&pg=PT26}}</ref>\n\n==Career==\n===1971\u20131982===\n\n{{main|Salim-Javed}}\n\nInitially, in the 1970s, there was no concept of having the same writer for the screenplay, story and dialogue, nor were the writers given any credits in the titles.

Akhtar was particularly influenced by the ''[[Jasoosi Dunya]]'' and [[Imran series|''Imran'' series]] of [[detective novels]], such as ''[[The House of Fear (novel)|The House of Fear]]'' (1955). He was influenced by their fast action, tight plots, economies of expression, fascinating characters with catchy memorable names, and speaking styles. Two of the earliest films he remembered watching both starred [[Dilip Kumar]]: [[Shaheed Latif]]'s ''[[Arzoo (1950 film)|Arzoo]]'' (1950) and [[Mehboob Khan]]'s ''[[Aan]]'' (1952). Other films that influenced him as a child include [[Bimal Roy]]'s ''[[Do Bigha Zameen]]'' (1953), [[Satyen Bose]]'s ''[[Jagriti]]'' (1954), ''[[Shree 420]]'' (1955) directed by [[Raj Kapoor]] and written by [[Khwaja Ahmad Abbas]], ''[[Munimji]]'' (1955) directed by [[Subodh Mukherjee]] and written by [[Nasir Hussain]], and Mehboob Khan's ''[[Mother India]]'' (1957).<ref>{{cite book |last1=Chaudhuri |first1=Diptakirti |title=Written by Salim-Javed: The Story of Hindi Cinema's Greatest Screenwriters |date=2015 |publisher=[[Penguin Books]] |isbn=9789352140084 |pages=26\u201327 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Cri9CgAAQBAJ&pg=PT26}}</ref>\n\n==Career==\n===1971\u20131982===\n\n{{main|Salim-Javed}}\n\nInitially, in the 1970s, there was no concept of having the same writer for the screenplay, story and dialogue, nor were the writers given any credits in the titles.

They also had hits with ''[[Yaadon Ki Baaraat]]'' (1973), ''[[Zanjeer (1973 film)|Zanjeer]]'' (1973), ''Haath Ki Safai'' (1974), ''[[Deewaar]]'' (1975), ''[[Sholay]]'' (1975), ''Chacha Bhatija'' (1977), ''Don'' (1978), ''[[Trishul (film)|Trishul]]'' (1978), ''Dostana'' (1980), ''[[Kranti]]'' (1981), ''[[Zamana (1985 film)|Zamana]]'' (1985) and ''[[Mr. India (1987 film)|Mr. India]]'' (1987). They have worked together in 24 films including two Kannada films \u2013 ''[[Premada Kanike]]'' and ''[[Raja Nanna Raja]]''. Of the 24 films they wrote, 20 were hits. The scripts they wrote, but which were not successful at box office include ''Aakhri Dao'' (1975), ''Immaan Dharam'' (1977), ''Kaala Patthar'' (1979) and ''Shaan'' (1980). Though they split in 1982, due to ego issues, some of the scripts they wrote were made into hit films later, such as ''Zamana'' and ''Mr. India''.

After his graduation from USC in 1970, his first TV acting experience was a campus revolutionary in the TV series ''[[Dan August]]'' starring [[Burt Reynolds]] and future ''Three's Company'' co-star [[Norman Fell]]. Ritter made his film debut in the 1971 Disney film ''[[The Barefoot Executive]]''. He made guest appearances on the television series ''[[Hawaii Five-O (1968 TV series)|Hawaii Five-O]]'', ''[[M*A*S*H (TV series)|M*A*S*H]]'', and many others. He had a recurring role as the Reverend Matthew Fordwick on the drama series ''[[The Waltons]]'' from October 1972 to December 1976. Because he was not a weekly cast member, he had time to pursue other roles, which he did until December 1976, when he left for a starring role in the hit sitcom ''[[Three's Company]]'' (the Americanized version of the 1970s British [[Thames Television]] series ''[[Man About the House]]'') in 1977. In 1978, Ritter played [[Ringo Starr]]'s manager on the TV special ''[[Ringo (1978 film)|Ringo]]''. In 1982, Ritter provided the voice of Peter Dickinson in ''[[The Flight of Dragons]]''.\n\nRitter became a household name playing struggling culinary student [[Jack Tripper]] with two female roommates. Ritter co-starred opposite [[Joyce DeWitt]] and [[Suzanne Somers]], and then later [[Jenilee Harrison]] and [[Priscilla Barnes]]. Much of the comedy centered around Jack's pretending to be gay to keep the old-fashioned landlords appeased over the seemingly sordid living arrangements. The series spent several seasons near the top of the TV ratings in the U.S. before ending in 1984. A year-long spin-off ''[[Three's a Crowd]]'' ensued, as the Jack Tripper character has a live-in girlfriend and runs his own bistro. The original series has been seen continuously in reruns and is available on DVD. During the run of ''Three's Company'', Ritter appeared in the films ''[[Hero at Large]]'', ''[[Americathon]]'', and ''[[They All Laughed]]''. In 1986, he played the role of Dad in the music video for [[Graham Nash]]'s song \"Innocent Eyes\" from the [[Innocent Eyes (Graham Nash album)|album of the same name]].\n\n''[[Hooperman]]'' was Ritter's first regular television role after ''Three's Company''. Detective Harry Hooperman inherits a run-down apartment building and hires Susan Smith ([[Debrah Farentino]]) to run it. A relationship follows, and Hooperman must juggle work, love, and the antics of Bijoux the dog.

Ritter won a [[People's Choice Awards|People's Choice Award]] for this role. From 1992 to 1995, Ritter returned to television for three seasons as John Hartman, aide to a U.S. Senator in ''[[Hearts Afire]]''. This series starred [[Markie Post]] as Georgie Anne Lahti and [[Billy Bob Thornton]] as Billy Bob Davis. He also played Garry Lejeune / Roger Tramplemain in the production ''Noises Off'' in 1992.\n\nAfter his time on television, he appeared in a number of movies, most notably ''[[Problem Child (film)|Problem Child]]'' and its [[Problem Child 2|first sequel]]. He played the lead role in [[Blake Edwards]]' 1989 film ''[[Skin Deep (1989 film)|Skin Deep]]'', appeared in the film version of ''[[Noises Off (film)|Noises Off]]'', rejoined Billy Bob Thornton in the [[Academy Awards|Oscar]]-winning ''[[Sling Blade]]'' (playing a kindhearted, gay, discount-store manager), and co-starred with [[Olivier Gruner]] in the 1996 action film ''Mercenary''. Ritter starred in many made-for-TV movies, including ''Gramps'' (1995), co-starring with [[Andy Griffith]], Rob Hedden's ''The Colony'' (1995) with [[Hal Linden]], [[Stephen King]]'s ''[[It (miniseries)|It]]'', ''Danielle Steel's Heartbeat'' with [[Polly Draper]], and ''[[It Came From the Sky (film)|It Came From the Sky]]'' in 1999 with [[Yasmine Bleeth]].\n\nRitter also made guest appearances on TV shows, such as ''[[Felicity (TV series)|Felicity]]'', ''[[Ally McBeal]],'' ''[[Scrubs (TV series)|Scrubs]],'' ''[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer (TV series)|Buffy the Vampire Slayer]]'', and an episode of ''[[Law & Order: SVU]]'' (2002). He also provided the voice of the [[Clifford (character)|title character]] in the animated children's show ''[[Clifford the Big Red Dog (TV series)|Clifford the Big Red Dog]]'', a role for which he received four [[Daytime Emmy Award|Emmy]] nominations.

The purpose of the JRF is to provide accurate information to the general public about the disease and its risk factors, provide support to individuals who have thoracic aortic disease or have lost a loved one to the disease, and improve the identification of individuals at risk for aortic dissections and the treatment of thoracic aortic disease through medical research. Yasbeck worked with the [[University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston]] (UTHealth) to establish the John Ritter Research Program in Aortic and Vascular Diseases with the goal of preventing premature deaths due to aortic dissection by identifying genetic mutations that predispose individuals to thoracic aortic aneurysms and dissections.\n\n==Filmography==\n\n===Film===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!

While still in college, Ritter traveled to the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, and West Germany to perform in plays.

After his graduation from USC in 1970, his first TV acting experience was a campus revolutionary in the TV series ''[[Dan August]]'' starring [[Burt Reynolds]] and future ''Three's Company'' co-star [[Norman Fell]]. Ritter made his film debut in the 1971 Disney film ''[[The Barefoot Executive]]''. He made guest appearances on the television series ''[[Hawaii Five-O (1968 TV series)|Hawaii Five-O]]'', ''[[M*A*S*H (TV series)|M*A*S*H]]'', and many others. He had a recurring role as the Reverend Matthew Fordwick on the drama series ''[[The Waltons]]'' from October 1972 to December 1976. Because he was not a weekly cast member, he had time to pursue other roles, which he did until December 1976, when he left for a starring role in the hit sitcom ''[[Three's Company]]'' (the Americanized version of the 1970s British [[Thames Television]] series ''[[Man About the House]]'') in 1977. In 1978, Ritter played [[Ringo Starr]]'s manager on the TV special ''[[Ringo (1978 film)|Ringo]]''. In 1982, Ritter provided the voice of Peter Dickinson in ''[[The Flight of Dragons]]''.\n\nRitter became a household name playing struggling culinary student [[Jack Tripper]] with two female roommates. Ritter co-starred opposite [[Joyce DeWitt]] and [[Suzanne Somers]], and then later [[Jenilee Harrison]] and [[Priscilla Barnes]]. Much of the comedy centered around Jack's pretending to be gay to keep the old-fashioned landlords appeased over the seemingly sordid living arrangements. The series spent several seasons near the top of the TV ratings in the U.S. before ending in 1984. A year-long spin-off ''[[Three's a Crowd]]'' ensued, as the Jack Tripper character has a live-in girlfriend and runs his own bistro. The original series has been seen continuously in reruns and is available on DVD. During the run of ''Three's Company'', Ritter appeared in the films ''[[Hero at Large]]'', ''[[Americathon]]'', and ''[[They All Laughed]]''. In 1986, he played the role of Dad in the music video for [[Graham Nash]]'s song \"Innocent Eyes\" from the [[Innocent Eyes (Graham Nash album)|album of the same name]].\n\n''[[Hooperman]]'' was Ritter's first regular television role after ''Three's Company''. Detective Harry Hooperman inherits a run-down apartment building and hires Susan Smith ([[Debrah Farentino]]) to run it. A relationship follows, and Hooperman must juggle work, love, and the antics of Bijoux the dog. In 1988, John was nominated for both an [[Emmy Award]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.emmys.com/celebrities/john-ritter |title=John Ritter Emmy Nominated |publisher=Emmys.com |date=September 12, 2003 |accessdate=December 12, 2014}}</ref> and a [[Golden Globe Award]] for his work on ''Hooperman''. Ritter won a [[People's Choice Awards|People's Choice Award]] for this role. From 1992 to 1995, Ritter returned to television for three seasons as John Hartman, aide to a U.S. Senator in ''[[Hearts Afire]]''. This series starred [[Markie Post]] as Georgie Anne Lahti and [[Billy Bob Thornton]] as Billy Bob Davis. He also played Garry Lejeune / Roger Tramplemain in the production ''Noises Off'' in 1992.\n\nAfter his time on television, he appeared in a number of movies, most notably ''[[Problem Child (film)|Problem Child]]'' and its [[Problem Child 2|first sequel]]. He played the lead role in [[Blake Edwards]]' 1989 film ''[[Skin Deep (1989 film)|Skin Deep]]'', appeared in the film version of ''[[Noises Off (film)|Noises Off]]'', rejoined Billy Bob Thornton in the [[Academy Awards|Oscar]]-winning ''[[Sling Blade]]'' (playing a kindhearted, gay, discount-store manager), and co-starred with [[Olivier Gruner]] in the 1996 action film ''Mercenary''. Ritter starred in many made-for-TV movies, including ''Gramps'' (1995), co-starring with [[Andy Griffith]], Rob Hedden's ''The Colony'' (1995) with [[Hal Linden]], [[Stephen King]]'s ''[[It (miniseries)|It]]'', ''Danielle Steel's Heartbeat'' with [[Polly Draper]], and ''[[It Came From the Sky (film)|It Came From the Sky]]'' in 1999 with [[Yasmine Bleeth]].\n\nRitter also made guest appearances on TV shows, such as ''[[Felicity (TV series)|Felicity]]'', ''[[Ally McBeal]],'' ''[[Scrubs (TV series)|Scrubs]],'' ''[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer (TV series)|Buffy the Vampire Slayer]]'', and an episode of ''[[Law & Order: SVU]]'' (2002). He also provided the voice of the [[Clifford (character)|title character]] in the animated children's show ''[[Clifford the Big Red Dog (TV series)|Clifford the Big Red Dog]]'', a role for which he received four [[Daytime Emmy Award|Emmy]] nominations. His final film was ''[[Stanley's Dinosaur Round-Up]]'' (2006), an animated direct-to-DVD film based on the television series, which was dedicated to his memory.\n\nAt the time of his death he was starring in ''[[8 Simple Rules|8 Simple Rules for Dating My Teenage Daughter]]''.\n\n===Theater===\nRitter played Claude Pichon in ''[[The Dinner Party (play)|The Dinner Party]]'' (2000) at the [[Music Box Theatre]] on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]], which was written by [[Neil Simon]].

The purpose of the JRF is to provide accurate information to the general public about the disease and its risk factors, provide support to individuals who have thoracic aortic disease or have lost a loved one to the disease, and improve the identification of individuals at risk for aortic dissections and the treatment of thoracic aortic disease through medical research. Yasbeck worked with the [[University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston]] (UTHealth) to establish the John Ritter Research Program in Aortic and Vascular Diseases with the goal of preventing premature deaths due to aortic dissection by identifying genetic mutations that predispose individuals to thoracic aortic aneurysms and dissections.\n\n==Filmography==\n\n===Film===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!

{"title_page": "Chinnamalai", "text_new": "{{moresources|date=May 2018}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=May 2018}}\n{{Use Indian English|date=May 2018}}\n'''Little Mount''' (Chinnamalai) is a small hillock that lies on the bank of river [[Adayar River|Adayar]] in the [[Saidapet]] [[taluk]] of [[Chennai]], [[Tamil Nadu]], [[India]]. It is traditionally not acknowledged to be one of the places where [[Thomas the Apostle|St Thomas]], an apostle of [[Jesus]], lived and preached when he came to India. In 1551 AD, Portuguese built a Church over the site where St Thomas is believed to have lived in. Later, in the year 1970, a part of this old Church was demolished and a larger circular Church was built to accommodate more devotees.\n\nLittle Mount now is a mixed-use residential and commercial area. The neighbourhood houses the IX Metropolitan Magistrates Court (Saidapet) Advocate Shakir also residing here. Other Governmental offices located on the periphery of Little Mount include Raj Bhavan (the residence of the governor of Tamil Nadu), the headquarters of the state's Highways Department, and Panagal Maligai, which houses several government offices. \n\nCurrent developments in and around Little Mount include the New Life Assembly of God (NLAG) Church, Checkers Hotel, [[Lemon Tree Hotel]], and the Temple Steps office complex. \n\nLittle Mount is a stop on Line 1 of the Chennai Metro that runs between Washermanpet and the Airport.\n\n== St. Thomas ==\n\nSt. Thomas is believed to have stayed in a tiny cave in Little Mount. He led a spartan prayerful life in solitude, often praying on the top of the hill and preaching to the local crowds that gathered to hear the Good news. The cave is well preserved even today and can be accessed from the old Church (chinna kovil) and is used for prayer and meditation by the devotees from all creeds. On the other side of the cave is an opening through which St. Thomas is said to have fled to escape this assailants. At the front of this opening are the hand and foot imprints of St. Thomas etched on the rock. A little farther away from the cave is an eternal spring from which is believed to be a work of St. Thomas. When St. Thomas was thirsty, he split the rocks and drank the refreshing water that gushed forth from the spring.\n\n== Our Lady of Health Church ==\n\nThe Portuguese realized the importance of this sacred place and in 1551 AD, built a Church in honor of Our Lady of Health. A part of this Church still exists despite several renovations and development activities around it. You can access the cave, in which St. Thomas lived, from a small entrance at the left side of the altar of this Church.\n\n=== Developments Around the Church ===\nRecent developments in and around the Church include developing a large tract of land behind the Church as Holy Land. All stations of the cross and a few stations of rosary are built in concrete on this land. The altar at the Holy Land is said to have been  finished in [[Italy]] and blessed by the [[Pope]] before it was installed here.\n\nNew buildings in the Church campus include an adoration chapel, next to the old Church, a new parish office, at the other side of the circular Church, and a pulpit and altar to hold festival celebrations.\n\n=== Church Festival ===\nThe annual feast of Our Lady of Health is held on the fifth Saturday after Easter. It is preceded by flag hoisting nine days earlier and Novena. On each day, mass and prayers are offered for special intentions of a specific category of people. On the feast day, the high mass is followed by a car procession around the Church. Next evening, the flag is lowered after a high mass.\n\n=== Status of the Church ===\nRecently the Church was elevated to the status of a Shrine. Now it is referred as \"Shrine of Our Lady of Health.\" Masses are offered regularly (at 6:15 AM, 11:30 AM, and 6:00 PM during weekdays and (6:30 AM, 8:00 AM, 11:30 AM, and 5:00 PM during Sundays). During special occasions such as Christmas, masses are offered in two languages (Tamil and English). Every Sunday a mass is held in Korean at 10 am and an English mass at 6:30 pm.\n\n=== Other Organizations of Church ===\n\n==== Our Lady of Health School ====\nThis school was started with the purpose of providing education in English medium for the poor residents of the Little Mount parish. This school has only primary section and after fifth class students usually move on to other schools for continuing their education.\n\n==== Immaculate Conception Convent ====\nThe Immaculate Conception (IC) convent is located behind the Church and near the entrance to Holy Land.\n\n==== Missionaries of Charity (Brothers) - Karunai Illam ====\nKarunai Illam provides a home for the destitute people who are differently disabled, both mentally and physically. It is run by brothers of [[Missionaries of Charity]]. Missionaries of Charity, Brothers was founded  in 1963 by Mother Theresa to do work similar to the Sisters of Missionaries of Charity.<ref>http://www.motherteresa.org/layout.html</ref>\n\n==== Ozanam Health Center ====\nThis health center was started at the initiative of Society of St. Vincent dePaul of Our Lady of Health Church. It was started at a time when common diseases were spreading among the poor people and doctors were difficult to find. It seeks to provide consultation and treatment to poor people for free or at nominal cost.\n\n==== St. Thomas Community Hall ====\nA small non-airconditioned community hall was constructed by the Church for use by its parishioners. It is built over two floors and has a very small car park. The first floor can seat about 300 people and the dining ground floor can seat about 100. Cars are often parked outside the facility in the land belonging to Church. It is not available during the Church festival period.\n\n==== Catholic Graveyard ====\nA graveyard used for burying the dead parishioners is located near the newly constructed Church of Latter Day Saints.\n\n== New Life Assembly of God ==\n{{Coord|13|00|56.8|N|80|13|27.7|E|display=title}}\n\nRev. Dr. David Mohan is the senior pastor of the church.

It is traditionally not acknowledged to be one of the places where [[Thomas the Apostle|St Thomas]], an apostle of [[Jesus]], lived and preached when he came to India. In 1551 AD, Portuguese built a Church over the site where St Thomas is believed to have lived in. Later, in the year 1970, a part of this old Church was demolished and a larger circular Church was built to accommodate more devotees.\n\nLittle Mount now is a mixed-use residential and commercial area. The neighbourhood houses the IX Metropolitan Magistrates Court (Saidapet). Other Governmental offices located on the periphery of Little Mount include Raj Bhavan (the residence of the governor of Tamil Nadu), the headquarters of the state's Highways Department, and Panagal Maligai, which houses several government offices. \n\nCurrent developments in and around Little Mount include the New Life Assembly of God (NLAG) Church, Checkers Hotel, [[Lemon Tree Hotel]], and the Temple Steps office complex. \n\nLittle Mount is a stop on Line 1 of the Chennai Metro that runs between Washermanpet and the Airport.\n\n== St. Thomas ==\n\nSt. Thomas is believed to have stayed in a tiny cave in Little Mount. He led a spartan prayerful life in solitude, often praying on the top of the hill and preaching to the local crowds that gathered to hear the Good news. The cave is well preserved even today and can be accessed from the old Church (chinna kovil) and is used for prayer and meditation by the devotees from all creeds. On the other side of the cave is an opening through which St. Thomas is said to have fled to escape this assailants. At the front of this opening are the hand and foot imprints of St. Thomas etched on the rock. A little farther away from the cave is an eternal spring from which is believed to be a work of St. Thomas. When St. Thomas was thirsty, he split the rocks and drank the refreshing water that gushed forth from the spring.\n\n== Our Lady of Health Church ==\n\nThe Portuguese realized the importance of this sacred place and in 1551 AD, built a Church in honor of Our Lady of Health. A part of this Church still exists despite several renovations and development activities around it. You can access the cave, in which St. Thomas lived, from a small entrance at the left side of the altar of this Church.\n\n=== Developments Around the Church ===\nRecent developments in and around the Church include developing a large tract of land behind the Church as Holy Land. All stations of the cross and a few stations of rosary are built in concrete on this land. The altar at the Holy Land is said to have been  finished in [[Italy]] and blessed by the [[Pope]] before it was installed here.\n\nNew buildings in the Church campus include an adoration chapel, next to the old Church, a new parish office, at the other side of the circular Church, and a pulpit and altar to hold festival celebrations.\n\n=== Church Festival ===\nThe annual feast of Our Lady of Health is held on the fifth Saturday after Easter. It is preceded by flag hoisting nine days earlier and Novena. On each day, mass and prayers are offered for special intentions of a specific category of people. On the feast day, the high mass is followed by a car procession around the Church. Next evening, the flag is lowered after a high mass.\n\n=== Status of the Church ===\nRecently the Church was elevated to the status of a Shrine. Now it is referred as \"Shrine of Our Lady of Health.\" Masses are offered regularly (at 6:15 AM, 11:30 AM, and 6:00 PM during weekdays and (6:30 AM, 8:00 AM, 11:30 AM, and 5:00 PM during Sundays). During special occasions such as Christmas, masses are offered in two languages (Tamil and English). Every Sunday a mass is held in Korean at 10 am and an English mass at 6:30 pm.\n\n=== Other Organizations of Church ===\n\n==== Our Lady of Health School ====\nThis school was started with the purpose of providing education in English medium for the poor residents of the Little Mount parish. This school has only primary section and after fifth class students usually move on to other schools for continuing their education.\n\n==== Immaculate Conception Convent ====\nThe Immaculate Conception (IC) convent is located behind the Church and near the entrance to Holy Land.\n\n==== Missionaries of Charity (Brothers) - Karunai Illam ====\nKarunai Illam provides a home for the destitute people who are differently disabled, both mentally and physically. It is run by brothers of [[Missionaries of Charity]]. Missionaries of Charity, Brothers was founded  in 1963 by Mother Theresa to do work similar to the Sisters of Missionaries of Charity.<ref>http://www.motherteresa.org/layout.html</ref>\n\n==== Ozanam Health Center ====\nThis health center was started at the initiative of Society of St. Vincent dePaul of Our Lady of Health Church. It was started at a time when common diseases were spreading among the poor people and doctors were difficult to find. It seeks to provide consultation and treatment to poor people for free or at nominal cost.\n\n==== St. Thomas Community Hall ====\nA small non-airconditioned community hall was constructed by the Church for use by its parishioners. It is built over two floors and has a very small car park. The first floor can seat about 300 people and the dining ground floor can seat about 100. Cars are often parked outside the facility in the land belonging to Church. It is not available during the Church festival period.\n\n==== Catholic Graveyard ====\nA graveyard used for burying the dead parishioners is located near the newly constructed Church of Latter Day Saints.\n\n== New Life Assembly of God ==\n{{Coord|13|00|56.8|N|80|13|27.7|E|display=title}}\n\nRev.
