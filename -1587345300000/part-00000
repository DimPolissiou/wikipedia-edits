The channel was launched on 25 September 2000. Coverage includes newscasts, in-depth reports, and commentary programs, as well as feature presentations. Its [[free-to-air]] satellite signal is received in over 100 countries.\n\nCGTN has been registered as a [[Foreign Agents Registration Act|foreign agent]] in the US.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/markdistefano/china-state-media-cgtn-foreign-agent-us|title=A Leaked Memo Says Chinese State TV Registered As A Foreign Agent \"In The Spirit Of Cooperation\"|website=BuzzFeed News|language=en|access-date=2019-12-29}}</ref>\n\n==History==\nCCTV began considering English-language international news programming on 1 January 1979, at the start of China's \"[[Reform and opening up]]\" period. English news bulletins began on [[CCTV-2]] in 1986 and became available to overseas viewers when they moved to [[CCTV-4]] in February 1991.  CCTV-9 began broadcasting across China on 25 September 2000, becoming the country's first all-English television station.\n\nOn 1 January 2003, CCTV-9 entered the United States cable market, as part of a deal that allowed [[AOL]], [[Time Warner]], and [[News Corporation (1980\u20132013)|News Corporation]] access to cable systems in [[Guangdong]].  In its early years, CCTV-9 broadcast English language news bulletins and cultural interest shows for most of each day, and aired mostly [[rerun]]s during the overnight hours in China. One of its biggest projects was covering the [[2008 Beijing Olympics]].\n\nUntil April 2010, CCTV-9 was a mixed general interest channel featuring news, travel programming, and language training.  But on the 26th of that month, CCTV-9 was relaunched as a 24-hour English-language news service, and its name was changed to \"CCTV News.\"<ref name=\"launched\">{{cite web |url=http://english.cctv.com/english/about/index.shtml|title=About CCTV News |accessdate=2009-08-21}}</ref>\n\nAt 04:00 [[Greenwich Mean Time|London Time]]/12:00 [[Beijing Time]], on 31 December 2016 the channel was relaunched as '''CGTN''' (''China Global Television Network''), and new programs debuted with the first programme ''Global Watch'' and first news anchored by Rachel Bubble.\n\nIn 2018 Kong Linlin, a CGTN reporter, verbally accosted a panel at the [[Conservative Party Conference]] and accused them, among other things, of being \u201cfake Chinese.\u201d After being asked to leave she assaulted another attendee.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Palmer |first1=James |title=China's Global Propaganda Is Aimed at Bosses, Not Foreigners |url=https://foreignpolicy.com/2018/10/01/chinas-global-propaganda-is-aimed-at-bosses-not-foreigners/ |website=foreignpolicy.com |publisher=Foreign Policy |accessdate=10 December 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Relaunch==\nThe channel name of CCTV-9 was changed to CCTV News on 26 April 2010.<ref>[http://english.cntv.cn/20100426/104481.shtml CCTV News, Your Link to Asia] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100512133051/http://english.cntv.cn/20100426/104481.shtml |date=12 May 2010 }} CCTV Press Release, 26 April 2010</ref> Some shows were rebranded while other new programs were added. The English website is managed by [[China Network Television]] (CNTV), a web streaming service of CCTV.  On 1 January 2011, the channel's former name CCTV-9 was taken over by [[CCTV-9|CCTV's two documentary channels]].\n\nWith new faces, new studios, and new equipment, the channel's upper managers said they hoped to strengthen the network's news gathering abilities, while aiming to present more perspectives from throughout China, and across Asia, to the rest of the world.<ref>[http://english.cntv.cn/program/newsupdate/20100426/104972.shtml China's English news channel relaunches 26 April] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130531031718/http://english.cntv.cn/program/newsupdate/20100426/104972.shtml |date=31 May 2013 }} CCTV Press Release, 26 April 2010</ref>  The next steps in this process included hiring additional foreign correspondents and setting up a number of international bureaus.\n\nOn 6 February 2012, the channel launched \"[[CCTV America]]\" and a schedule of daily programming originating from a production center in [[Washington, D.C.]]<ref>[http://cctv.cntv.cn/lm/cctvamerica/01/index.shtml About CCTV America] CCTV America</ref>  On 11 October 2012, CCTV News launched its Africa operation in [[Nairobi, Kenya]].<ref>[http://cctv.cntv.cn/lm/cctvafrica/01/index.shtml About CCTV Africa] CCTV Africa</ref>  CCTV News currently has three broadcast centers\u2014Beijing (main), Nairobi, and Washington\u2014with 70 additional bureaus across the globe.\n\nThe revamp also saw the permanent addition of news and world financial markets tickers, similar to those seen on leading news channels, although these features had already been used intermittently in the previous decade.{{Citation needed|date=December 2019}}\n\n==Programming==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=November 2010}}\nCGTN usually airs a live news bulletin in the first half of each hour. As well as the standard news strand ''The World Today'' (which broadcasts 15 times a day, 7 days a week), there are specialist bulletins focusing on Chinese and Asian news, such as ''China 24'' and business news (with regional variations) ''Global Business''. Programming in the second half of each hour includes, sports bulletins, a travel show called [[Travelogue (TV show)|Travelogue]] which takes viewers to destinations around China and the world, and magazines covering the arts, science and sports.\n\nThe news programs on CGTN include ''Africa Live'', ''Americas Now'' and ''Asia Today'', providing comprehensive news coverage that caters to the respective continents. ''The Link'' is a mix of the three aforementioned programs, though it still has an international appeal. ''Global Watch'' features a Chinese perspective on the news. Specialized programs include ''New Money'', ''Matchpoint'', ''Global Business'', ''Culture Express'' and ''Sports Scene'', providing news and information on business, finance, economics, culture, and sports. Shows such as ''Dialogue'' and ''World Insight'' extend balanced and critical perspectives on current affairs affecting all corners of the globe.\n\nCGTN also provides programs on culture, history, and modern society of China and Asia. In ''Crossover'', hosts and guests of various backgrounds and experiences talk about issues throughout China. ''Travelogue'' is the ticket to dynamic and exciting landscapes in China and abroad. ''Rediscovering China'' explores contemporary Chinese and Asian culture and social changes through the eyes of international visitors. Finally, ''Faces of Africa'' delivers African human interest stories.\n\n==Staff==\nThe Chinese staff members at CGTN English range in experience from interns to media professionals with years in the business. [[Executive producers]], producers and senior [[news anchors]] typically have higher education, often from universities in other countries. By 2007, the channel had about 300 staff members, of whom 70 were full-time with about 30 foreigners on contract. Ahead of the channel's 2010 relaunch, it began to hire foreign correspondents based in countries around the world, and in 2011 CCTV News started to hire English-speaking Chinese reporters based in 30 provincial bureaus across China.\n\n==Foreign news anchors==\nIn addition to Chinese anchors, CGTN employs foreigners as [[news presenters]], some of whom have extensive experience, such as [[Edwin Maher]] (a former newsreader and weatherman from the [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]]), while others may be recent university graduates just embarking upon their careers.\n\nFormer comptroller [[Jiang Heping]] defended the policy of putting foreigners on air, arguing that \"we feel international on-air personalities boost the credibility of CGTN and befit its image as an international channel. In this regard, CGTN will not restrict the origin of its employees and choose to build its unique identity through its programming.\"<ref name=JiangHeping>{{cite book |last=Jiang Heping |editor=Sucharita S.

Gelken left CCTV News in 2005, and returned to [[TVB News|TVB]] from 2010 to 2013.\n\nAnother prominent personality in CCTV-9's first decade was [[Mark Rowswell]], otherwise known as [[Dashan]]. He hosted ''Travel in Chinese'' on CCTV News and has been honored for his work in promoting cancer awareness in China.<ref>{{cite web|accessdate=2007-05-04|title=China's Most Famous Foreigner to Receive Prestigious&nbsp;\u2013 Mark Rowswell (\"Dashan\") to be Honoured for Raising Awareness of Cancer in China|first=Sophie|last=Welter|url=http://www.cancer.ca/ccs/internet/mediareleaselist/0,,3543_434465_288488355_langId-en.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050910215404/http://cancer.ca/ccs/internet/mediareleaselist/0,,3543_434465_288488355_langId-en.html|archive-date=10 September 2005|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nIn addition to those individuals, the channel later recruited [[Phillip TK Yin|Phillip Yin]] of [[Bloomberg Television]], and [[Mike Walter (newsman)|Mike Walter]] from [[USA Today]], to helm Biz Asia America and The Heat, respectively, when the Washington bureau opened in 2012.\n\nThe weather on CGTN is hosted by a rotating cast of presenters, so the staff changes on a frequent basis, partially because these updates are produced by an outside company which supplies content for several English-language media outlets around China.\n\n==CGTN Africa==\n{{main|CGTN Africa}}\nCCTV Africa is China Central Television's news productions center which was launched in Kenya on 11 January 2012. CGTN Africa focuses on African news and perspectives as well as international news.\n\nCGTN Africa is responsible for newsgathering and task assignments on the African continent.

It is based in Washington, DC and runs bureaus across North and South America.

English news bulletins began on [[CCTV-2]] in 1986 and became available to overseas viewers when they moved to [[CCTV-4]] in February 1991.  CCTV-9 began broadcasting across China on 25 September 2000, becoming the country's first all-English television station.\n\nOn 1 January 2003, CCTV-9 entered the United States cable market, as part of a deal that allowed [[AOL]], [[Time Warner]], and [[News Corporation (1980\u20132013)|News Corporation]] access to cable systems in [[Guangdong]].  In its early years, CCTV-9 broadcast English language news bulletins and cultural interest shows for most of each day, and aired mostly [[rerun]]s during the overnight hours in China. One of its biggest projects was covering the [[2008 Beijing Olympics]].\n\nUntil April 2010, CCTV-9 was a mixed general interest channel featuring news, travel programming, and language training.  But on the 26th of that month, CCTV-9 was relaunched as a 24-hour English-language news service, and its name was changed to \"CCTV News.\"<ref name=\"launched\">{{cite web |url=http://english.cctv.com/english/about/index.shtml|title=About CCTV News |accessdate=2009-08-21}}</ref>\n\nAt 04:00 [[Greenwich Mean Time|London Time]]/12:00 [[Beijing Time]], on 31 December 2016 the channel was relaunched as '''CGTN''' (''China Global Television Network''), and new programs debuted with the first programme ''Global Watch'' and first news anchored by Rachel Bubble.\n\nIn 2018 Kong Linlin, a CGTN reporter, verbally accosted a panel at the [[Conservative Party Conference]] and accused them, among other things, of being \u201cfake Chinese.\u201d After being asked to leave she assaulted another attendee.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Palmer |first1=James |title=China's Global Propaganda Is Aimed at Bosses, Not Foreigners |url=https://foreignpolicy.com/2018/10/01/chinas-global-propaganda-is-aimed-at-bosses-not-foreigners/ |website=foreignpolicy.com |publisher=Foreign Policy |accessdate=10 December 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Relaunch==\nThe channel name of CCTV-9 was changed to CCTV News on 26 April 2010.<ref>[http://english.cntv.cn/20100426/104481.shtml CCTV News, Your Link to Asia] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100512133051/http://english.cntv.cn/20100426/104481.shtml |date=12 May 2010 }} CCTV Press Release, 26 April 2010</ref> Some shows were rebranded while other new programs were added. The English website is managed by [[China Network Television]] (CNTV), a web streaming service of CCTV.  On 1 January 2011, the channel's former name CCTV-9 was taken over by [[CCTV-9|CCTV's two documentary channels]].\n\nWith new faces, new studios, and new equipment, the channel's upper managers said they hoped to strengthen the network's news gathering abilities, while aiming to present more perspectives from throughout China, and across Asia, to the rest of the world.<ref>[http://english.cntv.cn/program/newsupdate/20100426/104972.shtml China's English news channel relaunches 26 April] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130531031718/http://english.cntv.cn/program/newsupdate/20100426/104972.shtml |date=31 May 2013 }} CCTV Press Release, 26 April 2010</ref>  The next steps in this process included hiring additional foreign correspondents and setting up a number of international bureaus.\n\nOn 6 February 2012, the channel launched \"[[CCTV America]]\" and a schedule of daily programming originating from a production center in [[Washington, D.C.]]<ref>[http://cctv.cntv.cn/lm/cctvamerica/01/index.shtml About CCTV America] CCTV America</ref>  On 11 October 2012, CCTV News launched its Africa operation in [[Nairobi, Kenya]].<ref>[http://cctv.cntv.cn/lm/cctvafrica/01/index.shtml About CCTV Africa] CCTV Africa</ref>  CCTV News currently has three broadcast centers\u2014Beijing (main), Nairobi, and Washington\u2014with 70 additional bureaus across the globe.\n\nThe revamp also saw the permanent addition of news and world financial markets tickers, similar to those seen on leading news channels, although these features had already been used intermittently in the previous decade.{{Citation needed|date=December 2019}}\n\n==Programming==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=November 2010}}\nCGTN usually airs a live news bulletin in the first half of each hour. As well as the standard news strand ''The World Today'' (which broadcasts 15 times a day, 7 days a week), there are specialist bulletins focusing on Chinese and Asian news, such as ''China 24'' and business news (with regional variations) ''Global Business''. Programming in the second half of each hour includes, sports bulletins, a travel show called [[Travelogue (TV show)|Travelogue]] which takes viewers to destinations around China and the world, and magazines covering the arts, science and sports.\n\nThe news programs on CGTN include ''Africa Live'', ''Americas Now'' and ''Asia Today'', providing comprehensive news coverage that caters to the respective continents. ''The Link'' is a mix of the three aforementioned programs, though it still has an international appeal. ''Global Watch'' features a Chinese perspective on the news. Specialized programs include ''New Money'', ''Matchpoint'', ''Global Business'', ''Culture Express'' and ''Sports Scene'', providing news and information on business, finance, economics, culture, and sports. Shows such as ''Dialogue'' and ''World Insight'' extend balanced and critical perspectives on current affairs affecting all corners of the globe.\n\nCGTN also provides programs on culture, history, and modern society of China and Asia. In ''Crossover'', hosts and guests of various backgrounds and experiences talk about issues throughout China. ''Travelogue'' is the ticket to dynamic and exciting landscapes in China and abroad. ''Rediscovering China'' explores contemporary Chinese and Asian culture and social changes through the eyes of international visitors. Finally, ''Faces of Africa'' delivers African human interest stories.\n\n==Staff==\nThe Chinese staff members at CGTN English range in experience from interns to media professionals with years in the business. [[Executive producers]], producers and senior [[news anchors]] typically have higher education, often from universities in other countries. By 2007, the channel had about 300 staff members, of whom 70 were full-time with about 30 foreigners on contract. Ahead of the channel's 2010 relaunch, it began to hire foreign correspondents based in countries around the world, and in 2011 CCTV News started to hire English-speaking Chinese reporters based in 30 provincial bureaus across China.\n\n==Foreign news anchors==\nIn addition to Chinese anchors, CGTN employs foreigners as [[news presenters]], some of whom have extensive experience, such as [[Edwin Maher]] (a former newsreader and weatherman from the [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]]), while others may be recent university graduates just embarking upon their careers.\n\nFormer comptroller [[Jiang Heping]] defended the policy of putting foreigners on air, arguing that \"we feel international on-air personalities boost the credibility of CGTN and befit its image as an international channel. In this regard, CGTN will not restrict the origin of its employees and choose to build its unique identity through its programming.\"<ref name=JiangHeping>{{cite book |last=Jiang Heping |editor=Sucharita S.

Gelken left CCTV News in 2005, and returned to [[TVB News|TVB]] from 2010 to 2013.\n\nAnother prominent personality in CCTV-9's first decade was [[Mark Rowswell]], otherwise known as [[Dashan]]. He hosted ''Travel in Chinese'' on CCTV News and has been honored for his work in promoting cancer awareness in China.<ref>{{cite web|accessdate=2007-05-04|title=China's Most Famous Foreigner to Receive Prestigious&nbsp;\u2013 Mark Rowswell (\"Dashan\") to be Honoured for Raising Awareness of Cancer in China|first=Sophie|last=Welter|url=http://www.cancer.ca/ccs/internet/mediareleaselist/0,,3543_434465_288488355_langId-en.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050910215404/http://cancer.ca/ccs/internet/mediareleaselist/0,,3543_434465_288488355_langId-en.html|archive-date=10 September 2005|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nIn addition to those individuals, the channel later recruited [[Phillip TK Yin|Phillip Yin]] of [[Bloomberg Television]], and [[Mike Walter (newsman)|Mike Walter]] from [[USA Today]], to helm Biz Asia America and The Heat, respectively, when the Washington bureau opened in 2012.\n\nThe weather on CGTN is hosted by a rotating cast of presenters, so the staff changes on a frequent basis, partially because these updates are produced by an outside company which supplies content for several English-language media outlets around China.\n\n==CGTN Africa==\n{{main|CGTN Africa}}\nCCTV Africa is China Central Television's news productions center which was launched in Kenya on 11 January 2012.

It may be practiced for [[personal hygiene]], religious [[ritual]] or [[therapy|therapeutic]] purposes. By analogy, especially as a [[recreational]] activity, the term is also applied to [[sun bathing]] and [[sea bathing]].\n\nBathing can take place in any situation where there is any liquid, ranging from warm to cold. It can take place in a [[bathtub]] or [[shower]], or it can be in a river, lake, water hole, pool or the [[Sea bathing|sea]], or any other water receptacle. The term for the act can vary. For example, a ritual religious bath is sometimes referred to as immersion or baptism, the use of water for therapeutic purposes can be called a water treatment or [[hydrotherapy]], and two recreational water activities are known as [[Human swimming|swimming]] and paddling. people have bathed in slime, coke, and more!\n\n==History==\n\n=== Ancient world ===\n[[File:Stamnos women bath Staatliche Antikensammlungen 2411.jpg|thumb|upright|Three young women bathing. Side B from an [[Ancient Greece|Ancient Greek]] Attic [[Red-figure pottery|red-figure]] [[stamnos]]]]\nThroughout history, societies devised systems to enable water to be brought to population centres.\n\nThe oldest accountable daily ritual of bathing can be traced to the [[Outline of ancient India|ancient India]]ns. They used elaborate practices for personal hygiene with three daily baths and washing. These are recorded in the works called '''grihya sutras''' and are in practice today in some communities.\n \n[[Ancient Greece]] utilized small bathtubs, wash basins, and foot baths for personal cleanliness. The earliest findings of baths date from the mid-2nd millennium BC in the palace complex at [[Knossos]], Crete, and the luxurious alabaster bathtubs excavated in [[Akrotiri (prehistoric city)|Akrotiri]], [[Santorini]]. A word for bathtub ''asaminthos'' \u1f00\u03c3\u03ac\u03bc\u03b9\u03bd\u03b8\u03bf\u03c2 occurs eleven times in Homer.  As a legitimate Mycenaean word (a-sa-mi-to) for a kind of vessel that could be found in any Mycenaean palace, this Linear B term derives from an Aegean suffix ''-inth-'' being appended to an Akkadian loan word with the root ''nams\u00fb'' (\"washbowl, washing tub\").  This luxurious item of the Mycenaean palace culture, therefore, was clearly borrowed from the Near East.<ref>Reece, Steve, \"The Homeric \u1f08\u03c3\u03ac\u03bc\u03b9\u03bd\u03b8\u03bf\u03c2: Stirring the Waters of the Mycenaean Bath,\" ''Mnemosyne: A Journal of Classical Studies'' 55.6 (2002) 703-708. [https://www.academia.edu/30641266/The_Homeric_Asaminthos_Stirring_the_Waters_of_the_Mycenaean_Bath The Homeric Asaminthos]</ref>  Later Greeks established public baths and showers within gymnasiums for relaxation and personal hygiene. The word ''gymnasium'' (\u03b3\u03c5\u03bc\u03bd\u03ac\u03c3\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd) comes from the Greek word ''gymnos'' (\u03b3\u03c5\u03bc\u03bd\u03cc\u03c2), meaning \"naked.\"\n\n[[Ancient Rome]] developed a network of [[Roman aqueduct|aqueduct]]s to supply water to all large towns and population centres and had indoor plumbing, with pipes that terminated in homes and at public wells and fountains. The [[Ancient Roman bathing|Roman public baths]] were called [[thermae]]. The thermae were not simply baths, but important public works that provided facilities for many kinds of physical exercise and ablutions, with cold, warm, and hot baths, rooms for instruction and debate, and usually one Greek and one Latin library. They were provided for the public by a benefactor, usually the Emperor. Other empires of the time didn't show such an affinity for public works, but this Roman practice spread their culture to places where there may have been more resistance to foreign mores. Unusually for the time, the thermae were not class-stratified, being available to all for no charge or a small fee. With the [[Decline of the Roman Empire|fall of the Roman Empire]], the aqueduct system fell into disrepair and disuse. But even before that, during the Christianization of the Empire, changing ideas about public morals led the baths into disfavor.\n\n===Medieval Japan===\nBefore the 7th century, the Japanese likely bathed in the many springs in the open, as there is no evidence of closed rooms. In the 6th to 8th centuries (in the [[Asuka period|Asuka]] and [[Nara period]]s) the Japanese absorbed the religion of Buddhism from China, which had a strong impact on the culture of the entire country.  Buddhist temples traditionally included a bathhouse (''yuya'') for the monks. Due to the principle of purity espoused by Buddhism these baths were eventually opened to the public. Only the wealthy had private baths.\n\nThe first public bathhouse was mentioned in 1266. In [[Edo]] (modern Tokyo), the first ''[[sent\u014d]]'' was established in 1591. The early steam baths were called ''iwaburo'' ({{lang|ja|\u5ca9\u98a8\u5442}} \"rock pools\") or ''kamaburo'' ({{lang|ja|\u91dc\u98a8\u5442}} \"furnace baths\"). These were built into natural caves or stone vaults. In ''iwaburo'' along the coast, the rocks were heated by burning wood, then sea water was poured over the rocks, producing steam. The entrances to these \"bath houses\" were very small, possibly to slow the escape of the heat and steam. There were no windows, so it was very dark inside and the user constantly coughed or cleared their throats in order to signal to new entrants which seats were already occupied. The darkness could be also used to cover sexual contact. Because there was no gender distinction, these baths came into disrepute. They were finally abolished in 1870 on hygienic and moral grounds. Author John Gallagher says bathing \"was segregated in the 1870s as a concession to outraged Western tourists\".<ref>Gallagher, J. (2003). ''Geisha: A Unique World of Tradition, Elegance, and Art''. London: PRC Pub. p. 87. {{ISBN|1856486974}}</ref>\n\nAt the beginning of the [[Edo period]] (1603\u20131868) there were two different types of baths. In Edo, hot-water baths ('{{lang|ja|\u6e6f\u5c4b}} ''{{transl|ja|yuya}}'') were common, while in Osaka, steam baths ({{lang|ja|\u84b8\u98a8\u5442}} ''{{transl|ja|mushiburo}}'') were common. At that time shared bathrooms for men and women were the rule. These bathhouses were very popular, especially for men. \"Bathing girls\" ({{lang|ja|\u6e6f\u5973}} ''{{transl|ja|yuna}}'') were employed to scrub the guests' backs and wash their hair, etc. In 1841, the employment of ''yuna'' was generally prohibited, as well as [[mixed bathing]]. The segregation of the sexes, however, was often ignored by operators of bathhouses, or areas for men and women were separated only by a symbolic line. Today, ''sento'' baths have separate rooms for men and women.<ref>''Badeh\u00e4user, Schwitzb\u00e4der, Heisse Quellen''.

As the steam accumulates in the upper part of the room a person in charge uses a bough to direct the steam to the bathers who are lying on the ground, with which he later gives them a massage, then the bathers scrub themselves with a small flat river stone and finally the person in charge introduces buckets with water with soap and grass used to rinse. This bath had also ritual importance, and was vinculated to the goddess [[Toci]]; it is also therapeutic when medicinal herbs are used in the water for the ''tlasas''.

Public baths were also havens for [[prostitution]], which created some opposition to them. Rich people bathed at home, most likely in their bedroom, as 'bath' rooms were not common. Bathing was done in large, wooden tubs with a linen cloth laid in it to protect the bather from splinters. Additionally, during the [[Renaissance]] and [[Protestant Reformation]], the quality and condition of the clothing (as opposed to the actual cleanliness of the body itself) were thought to reflect the soul of an individual. Clean clothing also reflected one's social status; clothes made the man or woman.\n\nFurthermore, from the late [[Middle Ages]] through to the end of the 18th century, etiquette and medical manuals advised people to only wash the parts of the body that were visible to the public; for example, the ears, hands, feet, and face and neck. This did away with the public baths and left the cleaning of oneself to the privacy of one's home.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}\n\nThe switch from [[wool]]en to [[linen]] clothing by the 16th century also accompanied the decline in bathing. Linen clothing is much easier to clean and maintain &ndash; and such clothing was becoming commonplace at the time in [[Western Europe]]. Clean linen shirts or blouses allowed people who had not bathed to appear clean and well groomed. The possession of a large quantity of clean linen clothing was a sign of social status. Thus, appearance became more important than personal hygiene. Contemporary medical opinion also supported this claim. Physicians of the period believed that odors, or [[miasma theory of disease|miasma]], such as that which would be found in soiled linens, caused disease. A person could therefore change one's shirt every few days, but avoid baths &ndash; which might let the \"bad air\" into the body through the pores. Consequently, in an age in which there were very few personal bathtubs, laundry was an important and weekly chore which was commonly undertaken by [[laundress]]es of the time.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}\n\n===Modern era===\n\n====Therapeutic bathing====\n[[File:Hydropathic applications at Graefenberg, per Claridge's Hydropathy book.jpg|thumb|upright|Hydropathic applications according to Claridge's Hydropathy book.]]\nPublic opinion about bathing began to shift in the middle and late 18th century, when writers argued that frequent bathing might lead to better health.

It was in the mid-19th century, though, that the large-scale consumption of soap by the middle classes, anxious to prove their social standing, drove forward the mass production and marketing of soap.\n  \n[[William Gossage]] produced low-priced, good-quality soap from the 1850s. [[William Hesketh Lever]] and his brother, James, bought a small soap works in [[Warrington]] in 1886 and founded what is still one of the largest soap businesses, formerly called Lever Brothers and now called [[Unilever]].

A half day's work on Saturday for factory workers allowed them some leisure to prepare for the [[Sabbath|Sunday day of rest]]. The half day off allowed time for the considerable labor of drawing, carrying, and heating water, filling the bath and then afterward emptying it.

A soap and loofah is used to clean the body after, and then rinsed again using the mug. People most commonly bathe in their home or use a private bath in a public bathhouse. In some societies, bathing can take place in rivers, creeks, lakes or water holes, or any other place where there is an adequate pool of water. The [[quality of water]] used for bathing purposes varies considerably. Normally bathing involves use of [[soap]] or a soap-like substance, such as shower gel. In southern India people more commonly use aromatic oil and other home-made body scrubs.\n\nBathing occasions can also be occasions of social interactions, such as in [[Public bathing|public]], [[Turkish bath|Turkish]], [[banya (sauna)|banya]], [[sauna]] or [[whirlpool]] baths.\n\n=== Sponge bath ===\nWhen water is in short supply or a person is not fit to have a standing bath, a wet cloth or [[Sponge (material)|sponge]] can be used, or the person can wash by splashing water over their body. A sponge bath is usually conducted in hospitals, which involves one person washing another with a [[Sponge (material)|sponge]], while the person being washed remains lying in bed.\n\n===Ladling water from a container===\n[[File:Nude woman washing face, animated from Animal locomotion, Vol. IV, Plate 413 by Eadweard Muybridge.gif|thumb|100px|[[Eadweard Muybridge]], 1872\u20131885 (photographed); 1887 (images published); 2012 (animated), Nude woman washing face, animated from ''Animal locomotion'', Vol. IV, Plate 413]]\nThis method involves using a small container to scoop water out of a large container and pour water over the body, in such a way that this water does not go back into the large container.\n\nIn Indonesia and Malaysia, this is a traditional method referred to as ''mandi''.\n\nIn the Indonesian language, ''mandi'' is the verb for this process; ''bak mandi'' is the large container, and ''kamar mandi'' is the place in which this is done.<ref>From the ''Kamus Besar Bahasa Indonesia'', fourth edition: \n::::{{Quote|'''mandi''' ''v.'' to wash one's body with water and soap (by pouring water over or soaking one's body, etc.) [''membersihkan tubuh dng air dan  sabun dng cara menyiramkan, merendamkan diri ke air, dsb.''] p.871|}}\n::::{{Quote|'''bak mandi''' ''n.'' something used to hold water for bathing [''kolam tempat air untuk mandi''], p. 121}}\n::::{{Quote|'''kamar mandi''' ''n.'' place for bathing [''bilik tempat mandi''], p. 611}}</ref><ref>http://en.allexperts.com/q/Indonesia-193/Indonesian-culture.htm Accessed: 2011-03-08.

This is the case in private baths, whether in one's home or a private bath in a public bathhouse. In [[public bathing]] situations, the [[social norm]]s of the community are followed, and some people wear a [[swimsuit]] or underwear. For example, when a shower is provided in a non-[[sex segregation|sex segregated]] area of a public swimming pool, users of the shower commonly wear their swimsuit. The customs can vary depending on the age of a person, and whether the bathing is in a [[sex segregation|sex segregated]] situation. In some societies, some communal bathing is also done without clothing.\n\nWhen swimming, not wearing clothing is sometimes called [[nude swimming|skinny dipping]].\n\n==Bathing babies==\nBabies can be washed in a kitchen sink or a small plastic [[baby bath]], instead of using a standard bath which offers little control of the infant's movements and requires the parent to lean awkwardly or kneel.<ref>[http://www.babycentre.co.uk/baby/dailycare/bathingyourbaby/ \"Bathing your baby\"], babycentre.co.uk.

Bath water in Japan is much hotter than what is usual in Central Europe. The temperature is usually well above 40&nbsp;\u00b0C. In medical literature, 47&nbsp;\u00b0C is considered bearable.<ref>K.Kubota, K.Tamura, H.Take, H.Kurabayashi, M.Mori, T.Shirakura: ''[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&db=pubmed&dopt=Abstract&list_uids=7730738 Dependence on very hot hot-spring bathing in a refractory case of atopic dermatitis.]'' in: ''Journal of medicine.'' 25.1994, 5,333-336. {{ISSN|0025-7850}}</ref> The heat is considered a prerequisite for complete relaxation. The custom is to thoroughly clean oneself with soap and rinse before entering the tub, so as not to contaminate the bath water. Until the 19th century, the Japanese did not use soap, but rubbed the skin with certain herbs, or rice bran, which was also a natural exfoliant.\n\n===Public baths===\n[[File:Sento-gutenburgimage.jpg|thumb|left|Sento bathing scene. Japanese woman bathing in a wooden tub (woodcut by [[Torii Kiyomitsu]], late 18th century)<ref>Photo from \"Sketches of Japanese Manners and Customs\", by J. M. W. Silver. {{ISBN|978-1-4346-9833-9}}.</ref>]]\nIn public baths, there is a distinction between those with natural hot springs called, ''onsen'' (hot), and the other, the ''[[sento]]''. Since Japan is located in a volcanically active region, there are many hot springs, of which about 2000 are swimming pools. Most ''onsen'' are in the open countryside, but they are also found in cities. In Tokyo, for example, there are about 25 ''onsen'' baths. Locations of known mineral springs spas are on the Western model.\n\nAn ''onsen'', consists mostly of outdoor pools (''rotenburo''), which are sometimes at different temperatures. Extremely hot springs, where even experienced or frequent hot-spring bathers can only stay a few minutes, are called ''jigoku'' (hell). Many ''onsen'' also have saunas, spa treatments and therapy centers. The same rules apply in public baths as in private baths, with bathers required to wash and clean themselves before entering the water. In general, the Japanese bathe naked in bathhouses; bathing suits are not permissible.\nA newborn's skin is soft and delicate. Proper skin care and bathing can help maintain the health and texture of the baby's skin.<ref>urmc.rochester.edu/encyclopedia/content</ref>\n\n==Art motif==\n[[File:Pierre-Auguste Renoir, French - The Large Bathers - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|[[Pierre-Auguste Renoir]], ''[[Les Grandes Baigneuses (Renoir)|The Large Bathers]]'', 1887]]\n[[File:Albrecht D\u00fcrer - The Women's Bath - WGA7041.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Albrecht D\u00fcrer]], ''Woman's Bath'', 1496]]\nBathing scenes were already in the Middle Ages a popular subject of painters. Most of the subjects were women shown nude, but the interest was probably less to the bathing itself rather than to provide the context for representing the [[Nude (art)|nude]] figure. From the Middle Ages, illustrated books of the time contained such bathing scenes. Biblical and mythological themes which featured bathing were depicted by numerous painters. Especially popular themes included [[Bathsheba at Her Bath|Bathsheba in the bath]], in which she is observed by King David, and [[Susanna (Book of Daniel)|Susanna]] in the sight of lecherous old men.\n\nIn the High Middle Ages, public baths were a popular subject of painting, with rather clear depictions of sexual advances, which probably were not based on actual observations. During the [[Renaissance]] and [[Baroque]] periods, the gods and nymphs of [[Greek mythology]] were depicted bathing in allegorical paintings by artists such as [[Titian]] and [[Fran\u00e7ois Boucher]], both of whom painted the goddess [[Diana (mythology)|Diana]] bathing. Artists continued to paint Biblical characters bathing, and also sometimes depicted contemporary women bathing in the river, an example being [[Rembrandt]]'s ''Woman Bathing''.\n\nIn the 19th century, the use of the bathing scene reached its high point in [[classicism]], [[Realism (arts)|realism]] and [[impressionism]]. Oriental themes and harem and [[turkish bath]]s scenes became popular. These scenes were based on the artists' imagination, because access by men to Islamic women was not generally permitted.<ref>Alev Lytle Croutier: ''Wasser. Elixier des Lebens.'' Heyne, M\u00fcnchen 1992, S. 187 ff. {{ISBN|3-453-05924-7}}</ref> In the second half of the century, artists increasingly eschewed the pretexts of mythology and exoticism, and painted contemporary western women bathing. [[Edgar Degas]], for example, painted over 100 paintings with a bathing theme. The subject of Bathers remained popular in [[avant-garde]] circles at the outset of the 20th century.\n\n'''Notable artists who have represented bathing scenes:'''\n{{div col}}\n* [[Lawrence Alma-Tadema]]\n* [[Pierre Bonnard]]\n* [[William-Adolphe Bouguereau]]\n* [[Fran\u00e7ois Boucher]]\n* [[Paul C\u00e9zanne]]\n* [[Gustave Courbet]]\n* [[Lucas Cranach the Younger]]\n* [[Edgar Degas]]\n* [[Albrecht D\u00fcrer]]\n* [[Anthony van Dyck]]\n* [[Roger de La Fresnaye]]\n* [[Paul Gauguin]]\n* [[Jean-L\u00e9on G\u00e9r\u00f4me]]\n* [[Albert Gleizes]]\n* [[Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres]]\n* [[Ernst Ludwig Kirchner]]\n* [[Boris Kustodiev]]\n* [[Max Liebermann]]\n* [[\u00c9douard Manet]]\n* [[Jean Metzinger]]\n* [[Pablo Picasso]]\n* [[Pierre-Auguste Renoir]]\n* [[Sebastiano Ricci]]\n* [[Zinaida Serebriakova]]\n* [[Joaqu\u00edn Sorolla y Bastida]]\n* [[Domenico Tintoretto]]\n* [[Titian]]\n* [[Anders Zorn]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n<gallery widths=\"170px\" heights=\"170px\">\n  File:Lucas Cranach d.\u00c4. - Das Goldene Zeitalter (Nasjonalgalleriet, Oslo).jpg|[[Lucas Cranach the Younger|Lucas Cranach]], ''The Golden Age'', 1530 \n  File:Titian - Diana and Actaeon - 1556-1559.jpg|[[Titian]], ''Actaeon Surprises Diana in Her Bath'', 1559\n  File:Damen-baden-im-Fluss-1640.jpg|[[Wolfgang Heimbach]], ''People Bathing'', 1640\n  File:Boucher Diane sortant du bain Louvre 2712.jpg|[[Fran\u00e7ois Boucher]], ''Diana Leaving Her Bath'', 1742\n  File:Japanerin badet.jpg|[[Torii Kiyomitsu]], ''Bathing Woman'', 1750\n  File:Le Bain Turc, by Jean Auguste Dominique Ingres, from C2RMF retouched.jpg|[[Jean Auguste Dominique Ingres]], ''[[The Turkish Bath]]'', 1862\n  File:G\u00e9rome_Bad.jpg|[[Jean-L\u00e9on G\u00e9r\u00f4me]], ''The Bath'', ca. 1880\n  File:Degas_Nach dem Bade.jpg|[[Edgar Degas]], ''After the Bath'', ca. 1890\n  File:Paul Gauguin - Fatata te Miti (By the Sea) - Google Art Project.jpg|[[Paul Gauguin]], ''By the Sea'', 1892\n  File:Detail from Paul C\u00e9zanne, French - The Large Bathers - Google Art Project.jpg|[[Paul C\u00e9zanne]], ''The Large Bathers'' (detail)\n  File:The Baths at Caracalla.jpg|[[Lawrence Alma-Tadema]], ''The Baths at [[Baths of Caracalla|Caracalla]]'', 1899\n  File:Liebermann Badende Jungen 1900.jpeg|[[Max Liebermann]], ''Bathing Boys'', 1900\n  File:Triste herencia, por Joaqu\u00edn Sorolla.jpg|[[Joaqu\u00edn Sorolla y Bastida]], ''Sad Inheritance'', 1900.

It may be practiced for [[personal hygiene]], religious [[ritual]] or [[therapy|therapeutic]] purposes. By analogy, especially as a [[recreational]] activity, the term is also applied to [[sun bathing]] and [[sea bathing]].\n\nBathing can take place in any situation where there is water, ranging from warm to cold. It can take place in a [[bathtub]] or [[shower]], or it can be in a river, lake, water hole, pool or the [[Sea bathing|sea]], or any other water receptacle. The term for the act can vary. For example, a ritual religious bath is sometimes referred to as immersion or baptism, the use of water for therapeutic purposes can be called a water treatment or [[hydrotherapy]], and two recreational water activities are known as [[Human swimming|swimming]] and paddling.\n\n==History==\n\n=== Ancient world ===\n[[File:Stamnos women bath Staatliche Antikensammlungen 2411.jpg|thumb|upright|Three young women bathing. Side B from an [[Ancient Greece|Ancient Greek]] Attic [[Red-figure pottery|red-figure]] [[stamnos]]]]\nThroughout history, societies devised systems to enable water to be brought to population centres.\n\nThe oldest accountable daily ritual of bathing can be traced to the [[Outline of ancient India|ancient India]]ns. They used elaborate practices for personal hygiene with three daily baths and washing. These are recorded in the works called '''grihya sutras''' and are in practice today in some communities.\n \n[[Ancient Greece]] utilized small bathtubs, wash basins, and foot baths for personal cleanliness. The earliest findings of baths date from the mid-2nd millennium BC in the palace complex at [[Knossos]], Crete, and the luxurious alabaster bathtubs excavated in [[Akrotiri (prehistoric city)|Akrotiri]], [[Santorini]]. A word for bathtub ''asaminthos'' \u1f00\u03c3\u03ac\u03bc\u03b9\u03bd\u03b8\u03bf\u03c2 occurs eleven times in Homer.  As a legitimate Mycenaean word (a-sa-mi-to) for a kind of vessel that could be found in any Mycenaean palace, this Linear B term derives from an Aegean suffix ''-inth-'' being appended to an Akkadian loan word with the root ''nams\u00fb'' (\"washbowl, washing tub\").  This luxurious item of the Mycenaean palace culture, therefore, was clearly borrowed from the Near East.<ref>Reece, Steve, \"The Homeric \u1f08\u03c3\u03ac\u03bc\u03b9\u03bd\u03b8\u03bf\u03c2: Stirring the Waters of the Mycenaean Bath,\" ''Mnemosyne: A Journal of Classical Studies'' 55.6 (2002) 703-708. [https://www.academia.edu/30641266/The_Homeric_Asaminthos_Stirring_the_Waters_of_the_Mycenaean_Bath The Homeric Asaminthos]</ref>  Later Greeks established public baths and showers within gymnasiums for relaxation and personal hygiene. The word ''gymnasium'' (\u03b3\u03c5\u03bc\u03bd\u03ac\u03c3\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd) comes from the Greek word ''gymnos'' (\u03b3\u03c5\u03bc\u03bd\u03cc\u03c2), meaning \"naked.\"\n\n[[Ancient Rome]] developed a network of [[Roman aqueduct|aqueduct]]s to supply water to all large towns and population centres and had indoor plumbing, with pipes that terminated in homes and at public wells and fountains. The [[Ancient Roman bathing|Roman public baths]] were called [[thermae]]. The thermae were not simply baths, but important public works that provided facilities for many kinds of physical exercise and ablutions, with cold, warm, and hot baths, rooms for instruction and debate, and usually one Greek and one Latin library. They were provided for the public by a benefactor, usually the Emperor. Other empires of the time didn't show such an affinity for public works, but this Roman practice spread their culture to places where there may have been more resistance to foreign mores. Unusually for the time, the thermae were not class-stratified, being available to all for no charge or a small fee. With the [[Decline of the Roman Empire|fall of the Roman Empire]], the aqueduct system fell into disrepair and disuse. But even before that, during the Christianization of the Empire, changing ideas about public morals led the baths into disfavor.\n\n===Medieval Japan===\nBefore the 7th century, the Japanese likely bathed in the many springs in the open, as there is no evidence of closed rooms. In the 6th to 8th centuries (in the [[Asuka period|Asuka]] and [[Nara period]]s) the Japanese absorbed the religion of Buddhism from China, which had a strong impact on the culture of the entire country.  Buddhist temples traditionally included a bathhouse (''yuya'') for the monks. Due to the principle of purity espoused by Buddhism these baths were eventually opened to the public. Only the wealthy had private baths.\n\nThe first public bathhouse was mentioned in 1266. In [[Edo]] (modern Tokyo), the first ''[[sent\u014d]]'' was established in 1591. The early steam baths were called ''iwaburo'' ({{lang|ja|\u5ca9\u98a8\u5442}} \"rock pools\") or ''kamaburo'' ({{lang|ja|\u91dc\u98a8\u5442}} \"furnace baths\"). These were built into natural caves or stone vaults. In ''iwaburo'' along the coast, the rocks were heated by burning wood, then sea water was poured over the rocks, producing steam. The entrances to these \"bath houses\" were very small, possibly to slow the escape of the heat and steam. There were no windows, so it was very dark inside and the user constantly coughed or cleared their throats in order to signal to new entrants which seats were already occupied. The darkness could be also used to cover sexual contact. Because there was no gender distinction, these baths came into disrepute. They were finally abolished in 1870 on hygienic and moral grounds. Author John Gallagher says bathing \"was segregated in the 1870s as a concession to outraged Western tourists\".<ref>Gallagher, J. (2003). ''Geisha: A Unique World of Tradition, Elegance, and Art''. London: PRC Pub. p. 87. {{ISBN|1856486974}}</ref>\n\nAt the beginning of the [[Edo period]] (1603\u20131868) there were two different types of baths. In Edo, hot-water baths ('{{lang|ja|\u6e6f\u5c4b}} ''{{transl|ja|yuya}}'') were common, while in Osaka, steam baths ({{lang|ja|\u84b8\u98a8\u5442}} ''{{transl|ja|mushiburo}}'') were common. At that time shared bathrooms for men and women were the rule. These bathhouses were very popular, especially for men. \"Bathing girls\" ({{lang|ja|\u6e6f\u5973}} ''{{transl|ja|yuna}}'') were employed to scrub the guests' backs and wash their hair, etc. In 1841, the employment of ''yuna'' was generally prohibited, as well as [[mixed bathing]]. The segregation of the sexes, however, was often ignored by operators of bathhouses, or areas for men and women were separated only by a symbolic line. Today, ''sento'' baths have separate rooms for men and women.<ref>''Badeh\u00e4user, Schwitzb\u00e4der, Heisse Quellen''.

As the steam accumulates in the upper part of the room a person in charge uses a bough to direct the steam to the bathers who are lying on the ground, with which he later gives them a massage, then the bathers scrub themselves with a small flat river stone and finally the person in charge introduces buckets with water with soap and grass used to rinse.

Public baths were also havens for [[prostitution]], which created some opposition to them. Rich people bathed at home, most likely in their bedroom, as 'bath' rooms were not common. Bathing was done in large, wooden tubs with a linen cloth laid in it to protect the bather from splinters. Additionally, during the [[Renaissance]] and [[Protestant Reformation]], the quality and condition of the clothing (as opposed to the actual cleanliness of the body itself) were thought to reflect the soul of an individual. Clean clothing also reflected one's social status; clothes made the man or woman.\n\nFurthermore, from the late [[Middle Ages]] through to the end of the 18th century, etiquette and medical manuals advised people to only wash the parts of the body that were visible to the public; for example, the ears, hands, feet, and face and neck. This did away with the public baths and left the cleaning of oneself to the privacy of one's home.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}\n\nThe switch from [[wool]]en to [[linen]] clothing by the 16th century also accompanied the decline in bathing. Linen clothing is much easier to clean and maintain &ndash; and such clothing was becoming commonplace at the time in [[Western Europe]]. Clean linen shirts or blouses allowed people who had not bathed to appear clean and well groomed. The possession of a large quantity of clean linen clothing was a sign of social status. Thus, appearance became more important than personal hygiene. Contemporary medical opinion also supported this claim. Physicians of the period believed that odors, or [[miasma theory of disease|miasma]], such as that which would be found in soiled linens, caused disease. A person could therefore change one's shirt every few days, but avoid baths &ndash; which might let the \"bad air\" into the body through the pores. Consequently, in an age in which there were very few personal bathtubs, laundry was an important and weekly chore which was commonly undertaken by [[laundress]]es of the time.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}\n\n===Modern era===\n\n====Therapeutic bathing====\n[[File:Hydropathic applications at Graefenberg, per Claridge's Hydropathy book.jpg|thumb|upright|Hydropathic applications according to Claridge's Hydropathy book.]]\nPublic opinion about bathing began to shift in the middle and late 18th century, when writers argued that frequent bathing might lead to better health.

In 1850 he wrote ''The Pillars of Hercules'', a book about his travels in 1848 through [[Spain]] and [[Morocco]]. He described the system of dry hot-air baths used there and in the [[Ottoman Empire]] which had changed little since Roman times. In 1856 [[Richard Barter]] read Urquhart's book and worked with him to construct a bath.

It reached [[London]] in July 1860, when Roger Evans, a member of one of Urquhart's Foreign Affairs Committees, opened a Turkish bath at 5 Bell Street, near [[Marble Arch]]. During the following 150 years, over 600 Turkish baths opened in Britain, including those built by municipal authorities as part of swimming pool complexes, taking advantage of the fact that water-heating boilers were already on site.\n\nSimilar baths opened in other parts of the [[British Empire]]. Dr. John Le Gay Brereton opened a Turkish bath in [[Sydney, Australia]] in 1859, [[Canada]] had one by 1869, and the first in [[New Zealand]] was opened in 1874.

It was in the mid-19th century, though, that the large-scale consumption of soap by the middle classes, anxious to prove their social standing, drove forward the mass production and marketing of soap.\n  \n[[William Gossage]] produced low-priced, good-quality soap from the 1850s. [[William Hesketh Lever]] and his brother, James, bought a small soap works in [[Warrington]] in 1886 and founded what is still one of the largest soap businesses, formerly called Lever Brothers and now called [[Unilever]]. These soap businesses were among the first to employ large-scale [[advertising]] campaigns.\n\nBefore the late 19th century, water to individual places of residence was rare.<ref>''The Western Heritage'' (2004) by Donald Kagan, Steven E Ozment, and Frank M Turner. {{ISBN|0-13-182839-8}}</ref> Many countries in Europe developed a water collection and distribution network.

By the end of the century, private baths with running hot water were increasingly common in affluent homes in America and Britain.\n\nAt the beginning of the 20th century, a weekly Saturday night bath had become common custom for most of the population. A half day's work on Saturday for factory workers allowed them some leisure to prepare for the [[Sabbath|Sunday day of rest]]. The half day off allowed time for the considerable labor of drawing, carrying, and heating water, filling the bath and then afterward emptying it. To economize, bath water was shared by all family members. Indoor plumbing became more common in the 20th century and commercial advertising campaigns pushing new bath products began to influence public ideas about cleanliness, promoting the idea of a daily shower or bath.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}\n\nIn the twenty-first century challenges to the need for soap to effect such everyday cleanliness and whether soap is needed to avoid body odor, appeared in media.<ref name=\"theguardian.com\">Fleming, Amy, ''[https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2019/aug/05/i-dont-smell-meet-the-people-who-have-stopped-washing?CMP=GTUS_email \u2018I don\u2019t smell!\u2019 Meet the people who have stopped washing]'', The Guardian, August 5, 2019</ref>\n\n==Purpose==\nOne purpose of bathing is for [[personal hygiene]].

Bathing may be used to cool or to warm the body of an individual.\n\nTherapeutic use of bathing includes [[hydrotherapy]], healing, rehabilitation from injury or addiction, and relaxation.\n\nThe use of a bath in religious ritual or ceremonial [[rite]]s include immersion during [[baptism]] in Christianity and to achieve a state of ritual cleanliness in a ''[[mikvah]]'' in Judaism. It is referred to as ''[[Ghusl]]'' in Arabic to attain ceremonial purity (''Taahir'') in Islam. All major religions place an emphasis on ceremonial purity, and bathing is one of the primary means of attaining outward purity. In Hindu households, any acts of defilement are countered by undergoing a bath and Hindus also immerse in Sarovar as part of religious rites.\nIn the Sikh religion, there is a place at [[Harmandir Sahib|Golden Temple]] where the leprosy of [[Rajni]]'s husband was cured by immersion into the holy sacred pool, and many pilgrims bathe in the sacred pool believing it will cure their illness as well.\n\n==Types of baths==\n[[File:Carl Larsson Summer Morning 1908.jpg|thumb|[[Carl Larsson]], ''Summer Morning'', 1908]]\nWhere bathing is for personal hygiene, bathing in a [[bathtub]] or [[shower]] is the most common form of bathing in Western, and many Eastern, countries. Bathrooms usually have a tap, and a shower if it is a modern home, and a huge water heating pot. People take water from the tap or the water-heating pot into a large bucket and use a mug to pour water on themselves. A soap and loofah is used to clean the body after, and then rinsed again using the mug. People most commonly bathe in their home or use a private bath in a public bathhouse. In some societies, bathing can take place in rivers, creeks, lakes or water holes, or any other place where there is an adequate pool of water. The [[quality of water]] used for bathing purposes varies considerably. Normally bathing involves use of [[soap]] or a soap-like substance, such as shower gel. In southern India people more commonly use aromatic oil and other home-made body scrubs.\n\nBathing occasions can also be occasions of social interactions, such as in [[Public bathing|public]], [[Turkish bath|Turkish]], [[banya (sauna)|banya]], [[sauna]] or [[whirlpool]] baths.\n\n=== Sponge bath ===\nWhen water is in short supply or a person is not fit to have a standing bath, a wet cloth or [[Sponge (material)|sponge]] can be used, or the person can wash by splashing water over their body. A sponge bath is usually conducted in hospitals, which involves one person washing another with a [[Sponge (material)|sponge]], while the person being washed remains lying in bed.\n\n===Ladling water from a container===\n[[File:Nude woman washing face, animated from Animal locomotion, Vol. IV, Plate 413 by Eadweard Muybridge.gif|thumb|100px|[[Eadweard Muybridge]], 1872\u20131885 (photographed); 1887 (images published); 2012 (animated), Nude woman washing face, animated from ''Animal locomotion'', Vol. IV, Plate 413]]\nThis method involves using a small container to scoop water out of a large container and pour water over the body, in such a way that this water does not go back into the large container.\n\nIn Indonesia and Malaysia, this is a traditional method referred to as ''mandi''.\n\nIn the Indonesian language, ''mandi'' is the verb for this process; ''bak mandi'' is the large container, and ''kamar mandi'' is the place in which this is done.<ref>From the ''Kamus Besar Bahasa Indonesia'', fourth edition: \n::::{{Quote|'''mandi''' ''v.'' to wash one's body with water and soap (by pouring water over or soaking one's body, etc.) [''membersihkan tubuh dng air dan  sabun dng cara menyiramkan, merendamkan diri ke air, dsb.''] p.871|}}\n::::{{Quote|'''bak mandi''' ''n.'' something used to hold water for bathing [''kolam tempat air untuk mandi''], p. 121}}\n::::{{Quote|'''kamar mandi''' ''n.'' place for bathing [''bilik tempat mandi''], p. 611}}</ref><ref>http://en.allexperts.com/q/Indonesia-193/Indonesian-culture.htm Accessed: 2011-03-08.

This is the case in private baths, whether in one's home or a private bath in a public bathhouse. In [[public bathing]] situations, the [[social norm]]s of the community are followed, and some people wear a [[swimsuit]] or underwear. For example, when a shower is provided in a non-[[sex segregation|sex segregated]] area of a public swimming pool, users of the shower commonly wear their swimsuit. The customs can vary depending on the age of a person, and whether the bathing is in a [[sex segregation|sex segregated]] situation. In some societies, some communal bathing is also done without clothing.\n\nWhen swimming, not wearing clothing is sometimes called [[nude swimming|skinny dipping]].\n\n==Bathing babies==\nBabies can be washed in a kitchen sink or a small plastic [[baby bath]], instead of using a standard bath which offers little control of the infant's movements and requires the parent to lean awkwardly or kneel.<ref>[http://www.babycentre.co.uk/baby/dailycare/bathingyourbaby/ \"Bathing your baby\"], babycentre.co.uk.

Bath water in Japan is much hotter than what is usual in Central Europe. The temperature is usually well above 40&nbsp;\u00b0C. In medical literature, 47&nbsp;\u00b0C is considered bearable.<ref>K.Kubota, K.Tamura, H.Take, H.Kurabayashi, M.Mori, T.Shirakura: ''[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&db=pubmed&dopt=Abstract&list_uids=7730738 Dependence on very hot hot-spring bathing in a refractory case of atopic dermatitis.]'' in: ''Journal of medicine.'' 25.1994, 5,333-336. {{ISSN|0025-7850}}</ref> The heat is considered a prerequisite for complete relaxation. The custom is to thoroughly clean oneself with soap and rinse before entering the tub, so as not to contaminate the bath water. Until the 19th century, the Japanese did not use soap, but rubbed the skin with certain herbs, or rice bran, which was also a natural exfoliant.\n\n===Public baths===\n[[File:Sento-gutenburgimage.jpg|thumb|left|Sento bathing scene.

Silver. {{ISBN|978-1-4346-9833-9}}.</ref>]]\nIn public baths, there is a distinction between those with natural hot springs called, ''onsen'' (hot), and the other, the ''[[sento]]''. Since Japan is located in a volcanically active region, there are many hot springs, of which about 2000 are swimming pools. Most ''onsen'' are in the open countryside, but they are also found in cities. In Tokyo, for example, there are about 25 ''onsen'' baths. Locations of known mineral springs spas are on the Western model.\n\nAn ''onsen'', consists mostly of outdoor pools (''rotenburo''), which are sometimes at different temperatures. Extremely hot springs, where even experienced or frequent hot-spring bathers can only stay a few minutes, are called ''jigoku'' (hell). Many ''onsen'' also have saunas, spa treatments and therapy centers. The same rules apply in public baths as in private baths, with bathers required to wash and clean themselves before entering the water. In general, the Japanese bathe naked in bathhouses; bathing suits are not permissible.\nA newborn's skin is soft and delicate. Proper skin care and bathing can help maintain the health and texture of the baby's skin.<ref>urmc.rochester.edu/encyclopedia/content</ref>\n\n==Art motif==\n[[File:Pierre-Auguste Renoir, French - The Large Bathers - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|[[Pierre-Auguste Renoir]], ''[[Les Grandes Baigneuses (Renoir)|The Large Bathers]]'', 1887]]\n[[File:Albrecht D\u00fcrer - The Women's Bath - WGA7041.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Albrecht D\u00fcrer]], ''Woman's Bath'', 1496]]\nBathing scenes were already in the Middle Ages a popular subject of painters. Most of the subjects were women shown nude, but the interest was probably less to the bathing itself rather than to provide the context for representing the [[Nude (art)|nude]] figure. From the Middle Ages, illustrated books of the time contained such bathing scenes. Biblical and mythological themes which featured bathing were depicted by numerous painters. Especially popular themes included [[Bathsheba at Her Bath|Bathsheba in the bath]], in which she is observed by King David, and [[Susanna (Book of Daniel)|Susanna]] in the sight of lecherous old men.\n\nIn the High Middle Ages, public baths were a popular subject of painting, with rather clear depictions of sexual advances, which probably were not based on actual observations. During the [[Renaissance]] and [[Baroque]] periods, the gods and nymphs of [[Greek mythology]] were depicted bathing in allegorical paintings by artists such as [[Titian]] and [[Fran\u00e7ois Boucher]], both of whom painted the goddess [[Diana (mythology)|Diana]] bathing. Artists continued to paint Biblical characters bathing, and also sometimes depicted contemporary women bathing in the river, an example being [[Rembrandt]]'s ''Woman Bathing''.\n\nIn the 19th century, the use of the bathing scene reached its high point in [[classicism]], [[Realism (arts)|realism]] and [[impressionism]]. Oriental themes and harem and [[turkish bath]]s scenes became popular. These scenes were based on the artists' imagination, because access by men to Islamic women was not generally permitted.<ref>Alev Lytle Croutier: ''Wasser. Elixier des Lebens.'' Heyne, M\u00fcnchen 1992, S. 187 ff. {{ISBN|3-453-05924-7}}</ref> In the second half of the century, artists increasingly eschewed the pretexts of mythology and exoticism, and painted contemporary western women bathing. [[Edgar Degas]], for example, painted over 100 paintings with a bathing theme. The subject of Bathers remained popular in [[avant-garde]] circles at the outset of the 20th century.\n\n'''Notable artists who have represented bathing scenes:'''\n{{div col}}\n* [[Lawrence Alma-Tadema]]\n* [[Pierre Bonnard]]\n* [[William-Adolphe Bouguereau]]\n* [[Fran\u00e7ois Boucher]]\n* [[Paul C\u00e9zanne]]\n* [[Gustave Courbet]]\n* [[Lucas Cranach the Younger]]\n* [[Edgar Degas]]\n* [[Albrecht D\u00fcrer]]\n* [[Anthony van Dyck]]\n* [[Roger de La Fresnaye]]\n* [[Paul Gauguin]]\n* [[Jean-L\u00e9on G\u00e9r\u00f4me]]\n* [[Albert Gleizes]]\n* [[Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres]]\n* [[Ernst Ludwig Kirchner]]\n* [[Boris Kustodiev]]\n* [[Max Liebermann]]\n* [[\u00c9douard Manet]]\n* [[Jean Metzinger]]\n* [[Pablo Picasso]]\n* [[Pierre-Auguste Renoir]]\n* [[Sebastiano Ricci]]\n* [[Zinaida Serebriakova]]\n* [[Joaqu\u00edn Sorolla y Bastida]]\n* [[Domenico Tintoretto]]\n* [[Titian]]\n* [[Anders Zorn]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n<gallery widths=\"170px\" heights=\"170px\">\n  File:Lucas Cranach d.\u00c4. - Das Goldene Zeitalter (Nasjonalgalleriet, Oslo).jpg|[[Lucas Cranach the Younger|Lucas Cranach]], ''The Golden Age'', 1530 \n  File:Titian - Diana and Actaeon - 1556-1559.jpg|[[Titian]], ''Actaeon Surprises Diana in Her Bath'', 1559\n  File:Damen-baden-im-Fluss-1640.jpg|[[Wolfgang Heimbach]], ''People Bathing'', 1640\n  File:Boucher Diane sortant du bain Louvre 2712.jpg|[[Fran\u00e7ois Boucher]], ''Diana Leaving Her Bath'', 1742\n  File:Japanerin badet.jpg|[[Torii Kiyomitsu]], ''Bathing Woman'', 1750\n  File:Le Bain Turc, by Jean Auguste Dominique Ingres, from C2RMF retouched.jpg|[[Jean Auguste Dominique Ingres]], ''[[The Turkish Bath]]'', 1862\n  File:G\u00e9rome_Bad.jpg|[[Jean-L\u00e9on G\u00e9r\u00f4me]], ''The Bath'', ca. 1880\n  File:Degas_Nach dem Bade.jpg|[[Edgar Degas]], ''After the Bath'', ca. 1890\n  File:Paul Gauguin - Fatata te Miti (By the Sea) - Google Art Project.jpg|[[Paul Gauguin]], ''By the Sea'', 1892\n  File:Detail from Paul C\u00e9zanne, French - The Large Bathers - Google Art Project.jpg|[[Paul C\u00e9zanne]], ''The Large Bathers'' (detail)\n  File:The Baths at Caracalla.jpg|[[Lawrence Alma-Tadema]], ''The Baths at [[Baths of Caracalla|Caracalla]]'', 1899\n  File:Liebermann Badende Jungen 1900.jpeg|[[Max Liebermann]], ''Bathing Boys'', 1900\n  File:Triste herencia, por Joaqu\u00edn Sorolla.jpg|[[Joaqu\u00edn Sorolla y Bastida]], ''Sad Inheritance'', 1900.

{"title_page": "Effects of time zones on North American broadcasting", "text_new": "{{Multiple issues|\n{{original research|date=March 2011}}\n{{more citations needed|date=March 2011}}\n}}\nThe [[broadcast programming|scheduling]] of television programming in North America (namely the United States, Canada, and [[Mexico]]) must cope with different [[time zone]]s. The United States (excluding territories) has six time zones ([[Hawaii\u2013Aleutian Time Zone|Hawaii\u2013Aleutian]], [[Alaska Time Zone|Alaska]], [[Pacific Time Zone|Pacific]], [[Mountain Time Zone|Mountain]], [[Central Time Zone|Central]] and [[Eastern Time Zone|Eastern]]), with further variation in the observance of [[daylight saving time]]. Canada also has six time zones (Pacific, Mountain, Central, Eastern, [[Atlantic Time Zone|Atlantic]] and [[Newfoundland Time Zone|Newfoundland]]). Mexico has four time zones (Pacific, Mountain, Central, and Eastern). This requires [[terrestrial television|broadcast]] and [[cable television|pay television]] networks in each country to shift programs in time to show them in different regions.\n\n==In Canada==\n===Broadcast networks===\nCanadian broadcasting networks, with six time zones and a much larger percentage of its audience residing in the Mountain Time Zone than in the Central Time Zone, are sometimes able to avoid the issues that affect American programming by airing pre-recorded programs on local time. [[CBC Television]] and [[CTV Television Network|CTV]] created delay centres in [[Calgary]] in the early 1960s in order to allow programming to air in each time zone based on the region.<ref name=\"broadcasting-history\">{{cite web|title=\"Half an hour later in Newfoundland....?\" Yes, but why?|url=http://www.broadcasting-history.ca/index3.html?url=http://www.broadcasting-history.ca/networks/Calgary_Delay_Centres.html|date=2014-09-14|archiveurl=https://archive.today/20140914030146/http://www.broadcasting-history.ca/index3.html?url=http://www.broadcasting-history.ca/networks/Calgary_Delay_Centres.html|archivedate=2014-09-14|access-date=2019-08-04|url-status=dead}}</ref> \n\nIn order to protect local advertising revenue, the \"[[simsub]]\" rules allow broadcast stations to require feeds of U.S. broadcast stations on local pay television to be \"substituted\" with the Canadian station's signal if they are airing the same program. This can affect how commercial broadcasters schedule their programming outside of Eastern and Pacific Time: in Alberta, U.S. stations from [[Spokane, Washington]]\u2014a city in Pacific Time\u2014have historically been carried on cable. As such, the Calgary/Edmonton stations of the major commercial networks may air certain programs an hour later in comparison to other markets, in order to maximize simsub opportunities with feeds originating from Pacific Time. Saskatchewan [[Time in Saskatchewan|does not observe Daylight Saving Time]], and matches Mountain Time when DST is in effect. However, local stations maintain the scheduling patterns of their affiliates in [[Manitoba]] (which are CT but do observe DST), and do not follow the schedule patterns of their Alberta counterparts when DST is in effect. \n\nUnlike in the United States, virtually all live events, including live entertainment shows and sports television, are simultaneously broadcast nationwide in Canada. For instance, live shows in Canada are aired to entirety at the same time in all time zones based on Eastern time. Several live U.S. shows are also aired simultaneously in all of Canada, including for viewers in the Pacific Coast (unlike in the United States where some viewers on the same side of the continent depend on tape-delayed broadcasts for some otherwise live events). Conversely, live shows aired in Canada are frequently televised simultaneously for some viewers in the U.S. with access to Canadian broadcast networks.<ref name=\"broadcasting-history\" />\n\n===Cable and satellite channels===\nThe vast majority of [[specialty channel|specialty cable and satellite television channels]] in Canada each operate a single feed which is distributed in all time zones. This includes all French language channels, as they predominantly serve [[Francophone]] areas of the country, mostly in Quebec (almost all of which observes Eastern Time). Even many long-standing specialty channels with a general entertainment format use a single national feed, though in many cases they will repeat core primetime programming three hours after first broadcast, such that programs can be promoted as airing at the same time in both the Eastern and Pacific time zones.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}\n\nSome specialty channels do operate two separate broadcast feeds for [[Eastern Canada|Eastern]] and Western Canada. The Eastern feed airs programs on an Eastern Time schedule, while the Western feed airs the same programming on a three-hour delay. The separation between feeds is typically implemented at the border between [[Manitoba]] and [[Ontario]], which may result in a program that airs at 10:00&nbsp;p.m. Eastern Time in Ontario not airing in Manitoba until 12:00&nbsp;a.m. CT (whereas an equivalent program in the U.S. would typically be available at 9:00&nbsp;p.m. for Central Time viewers). However, one channel, the [[Aboriginal Peoples Television Network]], implements the separation at the border between Manitoba and Saskatchewan.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}\n\n===Watershed and safe harbour===\nThe [[Canadian Broadcast Standards Council]] (CBSC) applies more restrictive [[Censorship in Canada|censorship]] regulations to broadcast programming shown in prime time, compared to content transmitted after a [[Watershed (broadcasting)#Canada|watershed]] hour beyond which few children would be likely to be watching. This can be problematic if the same content is broadcast simultaneously nationwide, as the 9:00&nbsp;p.m. watershed in Vancouver falls at 12:00&nbsp;a.m. in Toronto and 1:30&nbsp;a.m. in St. John's. LGBT specialty broadcaster [[PrideVision]] was particularly affected as, from its launch in 2001 until 2005, its format included more innocuous entertainment programming aimed at the gay community during the day and in prime time and [[hardcore pornography|hardcore]] [[gay pornography|pornographic]] content in the overnight (with the latter expanding into the mid-evening by 2004). The network's adult programming was spun out into a [[Playmen TV|second channel]] so that the parent network, now [[OutTV]], could broadcast its non-explicit entertainment and lifestyle programming across its entire broadcast day.<ref>{{cite press release|title=PrideVision changing its format in preparation of new adult-only channel|url=http://www.channelcanada.com/Article639.html|website=Channel Canada|accessdate=August 20, 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061028231900/http://www.channelcanada.com/Article639.html|archivedate=October 28, 2006}}</ref>\n\n==In the United States==\n{{Missing information|section|Alaska and Hawaii|date=January 2019}}\n\n===Time zone feeds===\nWith four time zones in the [[contiguous United States]], American broadcast television networks generally broadcast at least two separate feeds to their [[owned-and-operated station]]s and [[network affiliate|affiliates]], as do [[cable channel|cable/satellite channels]]: the \"eastern feed\" that is aired simultaneously in the Eastern and Central Time Zones, and the \"western feed\" that is [[broadcast delay|tape-delayed]] three hours for those in the Pacific Time Zone. This ensures that a program, for example, that airs at 8:00pm ET on the East Coast is also shown locally at 8:00pm PT on the West Coast. Networks may also broadcast a third feed specifically for the Mountain Time Zone, on which programs are usually broadcast on a one-hour delay from the Eastern Time Zone. Otherwise, some stations in the Mountain Time Zone use the western feed, while others get a mix of both the Eastern and Pacific feeds.\n\nThe Eastern Time Zone is commonly used as a '' de facto'' official time for the United States because it includes the nation's capital city, Washington D.C.; the most populous city, New York City; and half of the country's population.<ref>Based on the 2011 population estimate, 46 percent of the American population live in the Eastern time zone, 30 percent in the Central zone; 7 percent in the Mountain zone, and 17 percent in the Pacific zone.</ref>\n\n===Broadcast television===\nEffectively, the East, Mountain and West network feeds allow prime time on [[terrestrial television|broadcast television]] networks to end at 10:00&nbsp;p.m. Central and Mountain and 11:00&nbsp;p.m. Eastern and Pacific. When it first expanded its programming into prime time in April 1987, [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] became the first major broadcast network in the U.S. to offer a \"common prime\" schedule; this type of scheduling subtracts an hour from the prime time schedule, reducing it to two hours on Monday through Saturdays and three hours on Sundays \u2013 ending evening network programming earlier than [[NBC]], [[CBS]] and [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] did \u2013 and continue to do (Fox did expand its Sunday primetime schedule into the 10:00&nbsp;p.m. timeslot in September 1987, before giving back that hour to its stations in September 1993). [[The WB]] and [[UPN]] followed the \"common prime\" scheduling model when they both launched in January 1995; the replacements for those networks, [[The CW]] and the [[MyNetworkTV]] program service, similarly used that model upon their launches in September 2006.\n\nIn 2009, [[PBS]] began using [[Internet server]]s instead of separate feeds for time delaying of its programming to the network's [[network affiliate#Member stations|member stations]]. The servers imitate a delayed program feed, broadcasting the program at the correct airtime as if it were being broadcast via satellite. This was done as PBS had upgraded its main program feed to [[high-definition television|high definition]] (or to [[widescreen]] digital at the very least) in December 2008, but satellite capacity allowed for only Eastern and Pacific time zone feeds, prompting the removal of the Central and Mountain time zone feeds and a shared feed for Alaska and Pacific time zones in February 2009, which created complaints from PBS stations.<ref>{{cite web|title=New servers, not separate feeds, will handle PBS time-zone delays (Idaho Public Television in the News)|url=http://idahoptv.org/press/showStory.cfm?StoryID=40733|website=[[Idaho Public Television]]|date= |accessdate=October 25, 2012}}</ref>\n\n===Cable and satellite television===\nSubscribers to cable or satellite television services may still only receive East Coast feeds for certain channels even if they reside on the West Coast. Some cable channels only offer one broadcast feed, where viewers see the same program in all time zones. For example, until it dropped the program in 2014, [[superstation]]-turned-basic cable channel [[WGN America]] telecast the noon (Central Time) newscast from [[WGN-TV]] in Chicago at 1:00&nbsp;p.m. Eastern in Washington, D.C. and 10:00&nbsp;a.m. Pacific in Los Angeles.\n\nBroadcasters offer East and West Coast feeds of some basic cable channels for viewing in all time zones. The usage of dual feeds of the same channel is a commonplace method for [[pay television|premium channels]] such as [[HBO]], [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]] and [[Starz]], in which the Pacific time zone feed of the primary channel is packaged with the East Coast feed of the main channel and the pay service's multiplex channels (if the premium channel has any). Most commonly, the Eastern and Pacific Time Zone feeds of only the main channel are packaged together, although some providers may also provide both coastal feeds of a premium service's multiplex channels. In some cases, cable networks (such as [[United States cable news|cable news]] and [[List of sports television channels|sports channels]]) \"fake\" the dual feed approach by recycling their same-day prime time programming during the overnight hours on a three (or four) hour cycle; in this case, the programs are automatically rebroadcast at the advertised time (or one hour later) in the Pacific Time Zone.\n\nIn the United States, distant over-the-air broadcast stations affiliated with the six broadcast networks are offered by [[direct-broadcast satellite television|direct-broadcast satellite]] providers as well as [[television receive-only|C-band]] services that do not offer locally based affiliates for most individual markets, allowing viewers to choose between the east and west feeds of a given network. These designated stations are usually owned-and-operated stations and/or affiliates of ABC, NBC, CBS, Fox and The CW located in the Eastern and Pacific Time Zones (usually those based in New York City and Los Angeles such as ABC's respective O&Os [network [[owned-and-operated station|owned-and-operated]]] in those markets, [[WABC-TV]] and [[KABC-TV]]). Dish Network and C-band providers also provide CW and MyNetworkTV affiliates designated as superstations (such as [[WPIX]] in New York and [[KTLA]] in Los Angeles), with Dish mainly making them available in markets where it does not carry a [[low-power broadcasting|low-power]], [[digital subchannel]]-only or non-broadcast affiliate of either network (especially in markets served by The CW's quasi-national feed for areas ranked below #98 in [[Nielsen Media Research]] market rankings, [[The CW Plus]]).{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}\n\nThe country's two major satellite providers \u2013 [[DirecTV]] and [[Dish Network]] \u2013 only offer these de facto coastal feeds in order to provide programming from at least one network to subscribers living in smaller [[media market]]s or rural areas where a network does not have a local affiliate available on the provider, if even presently serving the given location at all. Since the services began offering local network affiliates from additional markets in the early 2000s, many local stations have successfully sued DBS providers to deny access to distant stations carrying programming from the same network as them within their markets. This differs from the subscription television model in Canada, most cable and satellite providers carry distant over-the-air broadcast stations from the U.S. (consisting of both affiliates of the Big Four broadcast networks and minor network affiliates classified as superstations), in addition to O&Os and affiliates of domestically-based networks.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}\n\n===Live events===\n==== News and sports ====\nMost sports television programs, including other major national events, have been broadcast to totality live in all time zones across U.S. territories, but also present special problems for local stations. For such events, the networks may either advertise Eastern time only, or list the times in both Eastern and Pacific (e.g. \"8 p.m. Eastern/5 p.m. Pacific\"). As such, a live Sunday sporting event that is played from 1:00 to 4:00&nbsp;p.m. Pacific Time preempts local 6:00&nbsp;p.m. newscasts on the East Coast. Likewise, a [[State of the Union|State of the Union address]] that is televised at 9:00&nbsp;p.m. Eastern Time preempts local 6:00&nbsp;p.m. newscasts on the West Coast. News channels such as [[CNN]] and sports channels such as [[ESPN]] that frequently broadcast live events offer a single feed that airs in all time zones. About 80 percent of the U.S. population [[East Coast bias|reside in the Central and Eastern time zones]], where the nation's largest city (and the main anchor of television programming) New York is located.<ref>{{cite news|title=Oscars exec producer: 'We need to go for comedy'|url= http://www.cnn.com/2012/02/22/showbiz/tv/oscars-producer-telecast-ew/|first=Lynette|last=Rice|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|publisher=[[Time Inc.]]|via=[[CNN]]|date=February 22, 2012|accessdate=February 22, 2012}}</ref>\n\nA notable exception to live telecasts in sports are the [[Olympic Games]]. Although it has provided live coverage of events during other dayparts via platforms such as cable and streaming, NBC's flagship primetime coverage block typically featured tape-delayed and \"plausibly live\" presentations of events from earlier in the day. When allowed by the host's time zone, NBC did include live coverage of selected events in the block. This practice is reflected in the actual scheduling of the Olympic programme, which NBC may influence to maximize primetime viewership due to the value of its broadcast rights: at the [[2008 Summer Olympics]] in [[Beijing]], many swimming events were held in the morning local time to allow for primetime broadcasts in the Americas).<ref name=\"Guardian2006\">{{cite web | url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2006/jul/16/bbc.media | title=BBC at war over 'mad' Olympic start times | first=Denis | last=Campbell | work=The Observer | publisher=The Guardian | date=July 16, 2006}}</ref> This coverage block was, in turn, aired in tape delay on the West Coast.

The mechanics of the 2014 ABC series ''[[Rising Star (TV series)|Rising Star]]'' \u2014 which allowed for live, real-time voting by viewers \u2013 would allow the insertion of live reaction segments in the event that a contestant eliminated by low vote totals in the original Eastern/Central/Mountain time zone broadcast would be saved by results watching the Pacific/Alaska broadcast, but the show was broadcast live across the [[Contiguous United States|mainland U.S.]] except the Pacific time zone. Moreover, ABC noted that the chances of West Coast votes differing substantially from other viewers was statistically small.<ref>{{cite web|title='Rising Star' Producers Consulted Mathematicians Over Time Zone Dilemma|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/rising-star-producers-consulted-mathematicians-707878|author=Michael O'Connell|periodical=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|date=May 29, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title='Rising Star' Producers On How Interactive Talent Show Will Tackle U.S.' 4 Time Zones|url=https://www.deadline.com/2014/05/rising-star-producers-on-how-interractive-talent-show-will-tackle-u-s-4-time-zones/|author=Nellie Andreeva|website=[[Deadline Hollywood]]|publisher=[[Penske Media Corporation]]|date=May 29, 2014}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Academy Awards]], up until the early 21st century, was the only major U.S. entertainment television event to have been aired live to all continental U.S. time zones, but with a tape delay for viewers in Hawaii. Beginning the late 2000s, however, several award shows, such as the [[Golden Globes Awards]] and [[Billboard Music Awards]], joined the Oscars in conducting the same format of live broadcasts in response to longstanding general criticisms from the multimedia industry and viewers alike on some live shows televised real-time to the East Coast but are being [[broadcast delay|tape-delayed]] for West Coast viewers, albeit the fact that some of them originate from Los Angeles area. This is to cater for viewers in the Alaskan, Pacific and Mountain time zones who have frequently complained about [[spoiler (media)|spoiler]]s made by live viewers east of the Rockies during the broadcasts.\n\nThe [[Grammy Awards]] historically delayed its live ceremonies for West Coast viewers. However, starting 2016, the award show's rightsholder, CBS, began to allow its stations in the Western U.S. to carry the ceremony live as long as they also carry a prime time rebroadcast.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.vulture.com/2016/01/grammys-live-west-coast.html|title=For the First Time Ever, the West Coast Can Watch the Grammys Live, Too|last=Adalian|first=Josef|date=19 January 2016|work=[[New York (magazine)|Vulture]]|accessdate=6 February 2016}}</ref> Starting in 2017, CBS aired the Grammys live all across the U.S. (inclusive of time zones outside the contiguous U.S.), with a required primetime encore for viewers outside the Eastern and Central time zones. Despite shifting broadcast sources between Los Angeles and New York since [[60th Annual Grammy Awards|2018]], the Grammys continued to use the format, making it the first major award show to have aired live across all U.S. time zones.\n\nAlthough the [[Primetime Emmy Awards]], currently aired on rotation by ABC, CBS, Fox and NBC, began airing live coast-to-coast in the U.S. in 2010, the awards show followed suit with the Grammys in airing live simultaneously outside the contiguous U.S. time zones with CBS' telecast in 2017.

Some technically complicated ceremonies, such as the [[MTV Video Music Awards]], are usually edited before being recorded for broadcast on separate local primetime slots for both coasts.\n\n[[New Year's Eve]] specials covering [[Times Square Ball|Times Square's ball drop]] in New York City are typically tape delayed or encored for the west coast so that the countdown will correspond with the local time zone. As with primetime programming, they are typically broadcast live in the Eastern and Central time zones. Some affiliates may preempt the late-night segment of the networked special in order to broadcast local celebrations (such as Seattle's [[KING-TV]], which preempts the already tape-delayed ''[[NBC's New Year's Eve]]'' to broadcast coverage of midnight fireworks on the [[Space Needle]]),<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.seattletimes.com/entertainment/tv/tv-picks-for-monday-new-years-at-the-needle-on-king/|title=TV Picks for Monday: \u2018New Year\u2019s at The Needle\u2019 on KING|date=2018-12-31|website=The Seattle Times|language=en-US|access-date=2019-10-15}}</ref> and it is not uncommon for stations in Central Time to air a local New Year's special immediately after the conclusion of the network special, especially if it does not produce additional coverage focused on the area (such as ABC's ''[[New Year's Rockin' Eve]]'', which since 2017 has featured segments and coverage of midnight celebrations in [[New Orleans]],<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://deadline.com/2016/12/abc-ryan-seacrest-dick-clarks-new-years-rockin-eve-2017-1201864283/|title=\u2018Dick Clark\u2019s New Year\u2019s Rockin\u2019 Eve\u2019 Heads To New Orleans For First-Ever Live Central Time Zone Countdown|last=Lincoln|first=Ross A.|last2=Lincoln|first2=Ross A.|date=2016-12-05|website=Deadline|language=en|access-date=2019-10-15}}</ref> and ''[[Late Night with Conan O'Brien]]'', which did so to lampoon the [[East Coast bias|bias]] towards New York in New Year's coverage).<ref>{{cite web|title=Why Party Like It's 1999?|url=http://archive.southcoasttoday.com/daily/12-97/12-31-97/b01li062.htm|author=Frazier Moore|agency=[[Associated Press]]|newspaper=[[The Standard-Times (New Bedford)|The Standard-Times]]|publisher=The Standard-Times Company|date=December 31, 1997|accessdate=October 25, 2012}}</ref> A similar case was also done with NBC's coverage of [[Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade]] in New York City where it is live in the Eastern time zone (as well as Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands as they use the Eastern time zone Feed) but taped delayed in time zones west of Eastern Time so it starts at exactly at 9 AM in their respective local times.\n\nOccasionally, networks will produce and broadcast the same live event twice in one night \u2013 broadcasting once on an East Coast feed, and again on a West Coast feed three hours later. This permits more viewers to watch the broadcast live in prime time (although not all), as the show can air in its usual timeslot in all markets, but incurs the expense and difficulty of delivering two live broadcasts. In some cases, the two broadcasts may intentionally differ, prompting fans to compare notes and post scenes from each version online. While rare, the technique of multiple live broadcasts has been not uncommon for some special live episodes of scripted programs since the late 1990s, such as the ''[[30 Rock]]'' episodes \"[[Live Show]]\" and \"[[Live from Studio 6H]]\", ''[[Will & Grace]]'' with \"[[Alive and Schticking]]\", ''[[The West Wing]]'' with \"The Debate\", and ''[[ER (TV series)|ER]]'''s fourth-season debut with \"Ambush\".\n\nFew regularly scheduled prime time shows, both scripted and non-scripted, and sports and non-sports in genre, have been aired to totality at the same time live across all continental U.S. time zones. This format, similar to aforementioned major awards shows, involves airing live on prime time or late night in the East Coast (and late afternoon hours or on prime time, simultaneously and respectively, on the West Coast). NBC remains the foremost proponent of live television, with its broadcasts of ''[[NBC Sunday Night Football|Sunday Night Football]]'' and ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' being transmitted live across the contiguous U.S. states (and for the former, including for U.S. time zones outside the mainland), with a corresponding prime time or late-night encore for viewers outside the Eastern and Central time zones.\n\nIn mid-2018, ''[[American Idol]]'' became the first ever reality competition series \u2013 and first ever non-weekend regularly scheduled prime time program \u2013 in all of U.S. television to broadcast live<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://deadline.com/2018/04/american-idol-first-simulcast-will-allow-live-voting-across-the-us-1202373605/ |title=\u2018American Idol\u2019 First: Simulcast Will Allow Live Voting Across The US |last=Haring|first=Bruce|date=April 23, 2018|website=Deadline Hollywood |language=en-US |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180423153501/http://deadline.com/2018/04/american-idol-first-simulcast-will-allow-live-voting-across-the-us-1202373605/ |archive-date=April 23, 2018|url-status=live|access-date=April 23, 2018}}</ref> in all U.S. territories upon its revival on ABC after its [[American Idol (season 15)|initial first-run finale]] on Fox in 2016, beginning with its live shows in the final stages of the competition.

Despite the format having been in place for the show since [[American Idol (season 14)|2015]], as part of its nationwide voting expansion, a corresponding warning for viewers outside the Eastern and Central time zones regarding the closing of the voting window will be aired upon their local prime time encore broadcasts.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/american-idol-air-nationwide-live-telecasts-first-time-1104877 |title='American Idol' to Air Nationwide Live Telecasts for First Time |last=Strause|first=Jackie|date=April 23, 2018|website=The Hollywood Reporter |language=en-US |access-date=May 5, 2018}}</ref> The format would eventually extend to include the season finale round beginning [[American Idol (season 17)|2019]], making it the first ever primetime regular series in U.S. television history to air its season finale live all across the U.S.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://abc.go.com/shows/american-idol/news/updates/american-idol-2019-live-coast-to-coast-simul-vote |title=American Idol 2019 Live Viewing Coast-to-Coast & Simul-Vote Details |last=Barton|first=Amy|date=March 18, 2019|website=abc.go |language=en-US |access-date=April 3, 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Effects on local programming===\n{{unreferenced section|date=July 2018}}\nLocal stations and affiliates must schedule their local and [[broadcast syndication|syndicated]] programming around their respective network's feed. Because primetime programs on the East Coast feed are simulcast in two time zones, stations in the Central Time Zone are affected differently from those in the Eastern Time Zone. An hour of syndicated programming time (between 7:00 and 8:00&nbsp;p.m. in the Eastern and Pacific time zones) is lost in the Central and Mountain time zones since network primetime in those areas starts at 7:00&nbsp;p.m., forcing stations in Mountain or Central time (or in parts of both zones) to choose between airing their 6:00&nbsp;p.m. newscast and another syndicated or locally produced program or airing shows in \"blocks\" preferred by syndicators (for example, ''[[Wheel of Fortune (U.S. game show)|Wheel of Fortune]]'' and ''[[Jeopardy!]]'' together or ''[[Entertainment Tonight]]'' and ''[[The Insider (TV series)|The Insider]]'' together).\n\nThe most common set of programming chosen by stations aligned with the [[Big Three television networks]] (ABC, CBS and NBC) is to air a local newscast at 5:00&nbsp;p.m., national news at 5:30&nbsp;p.m., another local newscast at 6:00&nbsp;p.m. and syndicated programming at 6:30&nbsp;p.m., though some Fox stations that maintain a newscast schedule comparable to stations tied to the Big Three (commonly stations that were former ABC, NBC and CBS affiliates themselves) carry a 60- or 90-minute block of news from 5:00 to 6:00 (or 6:30) p.m. with an additional half-hour of local news in the 5:30&nbsp;p.m. timeslot as Fox does not air a national evening newscast; a few stations not affiliated with the Big Four networks, such as WGN-TV, KTLA in Los Angeles and [[WJXT]] in [[Jacksonville, Florida|Jacksonville]], Florida, follow a similar scheduling format with their early evening newscasts. Most Big Three affiliates in the Eastern and Pacific time zones follow this early evening newscast model as well, running a 90-minute block of news from 5:00 to 6:30&nbsp;p.m., particularly if they run a network's national evening newscast at 6:30&nbsp;p.m. Eastern and Pacific Time. Some stations, regardless of time zone, even show a newscast from 6:00 to 7:00&nbsp;p.m., which if run on a network station in the Central or Mountain time zones would lead into primetime network programming. Some television stations (such as [[WKYC]] and [[WJW (TV)|WJW]] in [[Cleveland]], Ohio, or [[WJAR]] in [[Providence, Rhode Island|Providence]], Rhode Island) have recently begun using the fact that primetime in the Eastern Time Zone begins at 8:00&nbsp;p.m. to their advantage by carrying a newscast during the 7:00&nbsp;p.m. hour, generally in order to attract viewers who work longer days and cannot return home to watch a 5:00 or 6:00&nbsp;p.m. newscast.\n\nMany stations that do not carry a newscast in the 6:00&nbsp;p.m. timeslot in the Central Time Zone (commonly [[Independent station (North America)|independent stations]] and most affiliates of non-historical networks like Fox \u2013 which has some stations that air a 6:00&nbsp;p.m. newscast, though this is not entirely commonplace \u2013 [[The CW]] and [[MyNetworkTV]]) air situation comedies or other types of syndicated programming, such as [[reality television|reality series]] or game shows, during that hour. Many stations in the Central Time Zone tend to air one or both parts of the syndicated block at 5:00&nbsp;p.m. or even earlier. Another more recent dilemma of the 7:00&nbsp;p.m. primetime start is that a combination of longer commutes and work hours than in the past have caused many people to not come home from work until after 7:00&nbsp;p.m., cutting into the potential ratings of shows that start at this time. Of course, the reverse is also true since simultaneous broadcasts offer viewers the chance to watch \"prime time television\" without having to stay awake until 11:00&nbsp;p.m.\n\n[[Local programming]] such as [[news broadcasting#television|locally produced newscasts]] are not typically affected as many stations air their morning newscast at 4:00, 4:30, 5:00 or 5:30&nbsp;a.m., and their early evening newscasts at 5:00 and/or 6:00&nbsp;p.m.; however, the late evening newscast is affected due to the differences in time between time zones, meaning that if the late local news starts at 10:00&nbsp;p.m. Central time on one network station, an affiliate of the same network in the Eastern Time Zone airs its newscast at 11:00&nbsp;p.m.; network evening newscasts on CBS, ABC, and NBC are affected since they are usually scheduled to air at 6:30&nbsp;p.m. Eastern Time (barring preemption due to network sports coverage or at the discretion of the local station, breaking news or [[severe weather]] coverage) in order to sync up with its simultaneous broadcast in the Central Time Zone. Midday newscasts are not necessarily affected, depending on whether the station's affiliated network schedules their daytime lineup simultaneously in the Eastern and Central Time Zones (as with ABC and CBS) or just to the Eastern Time Zone first (as with NBC). The late night program lineups on ABC, CBS, NBC and Fox are also similarly timeshifted, airing a half-hour later (after a newscast or syndicated programming if the station does not run news programming) but are shifted due to the time zone differences (a bigger issue with first-run late night programs that air after 12:30&nbsp;a.m. Eastern Time since the later start time may subject these programs to a potentially decreased audience). Many Fox, CW and MyNetworkTV affiliates, and some independent stations carry a prime time newscast that is similarly affected by the timeshifting of the prime time schedule, meaning that if said late evening newscast starts at 9:00&nbsp;p.m. Mountain Time on one network station, an affiliate of the same network in the Pacific time zone would air its news at 10:00&nbsp;p.m.\n\n==See also==\n*[[East Coast bias]]\n*[[Time shifting]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n[[Category:Television terminology]]\n[[Category:Television programming|Tim]]\n[[Category:Canadian television schedules|Tim]]\n[[Category:United States television schedules|Tim]]\n[[Category:Television in the United States]]\n[[Category:Television in Canada]]\n[[Category:Television in Mexico]]\n[[Category:Time in the United States]]\n[[Category:Radio in the United States]]\n[[Category:Radio in Canada]]\n[[Category:Time in Canada]]\n", "text_old": "{{Multiple issues|\n{{original research|date=March 2011}}\n{{more citations needed|date=March 2011}}\n}}\nThe [[broadcast programming|scheduling]] of television programming in North America (namely the United States, Canada, and [[Mexico]]) must cope with different [[time zone]]s. The United States (excluding territories) has six time zones ([[Hawaii\u2013Aleutian Time Zone|Hawaii\u2013Aleutian]], [[Alaska Time Zone|Alaska]], [[Pacific Time Zone|Pacific]], [[Mountain Time Zone|Mountain]], [[Central Time Zone|Central]] and [[Eastern Time Zone|Eastern]]), with further variation in the observance of [[daylight saving time]]. Canada also has six time zones (Pacific, Mountain, Central, Eastern, [[Atlantic Time Zone|Atlantic]] and [[Newfoundland Time Zone|Newfoundland]]). Mexico has four time zones (Pacific, Mountain, Central, and Eastern). This requires [[terrestrial television|broadcast]] and [[cable television|pay television]] networks in each country to shift programs in time to show them in different regions.\n\n==In Canada==\n===Broadcast networks===\nCanadian broadcasting networks, with six time zones and a much larger percentage of its audience residing in the Mountain Time Zone than in the Central Time Zone, are sometimes able to avoid the issues that affect American programming by airing pre-recorded programs on local time. [[CBC Television]] and [[CTV Television Network|CTV]] created delay centres in [[Calgary]] in the early 1960s in order to allow programming to air in each time zone based on the region.<ref name=\"broadcasting-history\">{{cite web|title=\"Half an hour later in Newfoundland....?\" Yes, but why?|url=http://www.broadcasting-history.ca/index3.html?url=http://www.broadcasting-history.ca/networks/Calgary_Delay_Centres.html|date=2014-09-14|archiveurl=https://archive.today/20140914030146/http://www.broadcasting-history.ca/index3.html?url=http://www.broadcasting-history.ca/networks/Calgary_Delay_Centres.html|archivedate=2014-09-14|access-date=2019-08-04|url-status=dead}}</ref> \n\nIn order to protect local advertising revenue, the \"[[simsub]]\" rules allow broadcast stations to require feeds of U.S. broadcast stations on local pay television to be \"substituted\" with the Canadian station's signal if they are airing the same program. This can affect how commercial broadcasters schedule their programming outside of Eastern and Pacific Time: in Alberta, U.S. stations from [[Spokane, Washington]]\u2014a city in Pacific Time\u2014have historically been carried on cable. As such, the Calgary/Edmonton stations of the major commercial networks may air certain programs an hour later in comparison to other markets, in order to maximize simsub opportunities with feeds originating from Pacific Time. Saskatchewan [[Time in Saskatchewan|does not observe Daylight Saving Time]], and matches Mountain Time when DST is in effect. However, local stations maintain the scheduling patterns of their affiliates in [[Manitoba]] (which are CT but do observe DST), and do not follow the schedule patterns of their Alberta counterparts when DST is in effect. \n\nUnlike in the United States, virtually all live events, including live entertainment shows and sports television, are simultaneously broadcast nationwide in Canada. For instance, live shows in Canada are aired to entirety at the same time in all time zones based on Eastern time. Several live U.S. shows are also aired simultaneously in all of Canada, including for viewers in the Pacific Coast (unlike in the United States where some viewers on the same side of the continent depend on tape-delayed broadcasts for some otherwise live events). Conversely, live shows aired in Canada are frequently televised simultaneously for some viewers in the U.S. with access to Canadian broadcast networks.<ref name=\"broadcasting-history\" />\n\n===Cable and satellite channels===\nThe vast majority of [[specialty channel|specialty cable and satellite television channels]] in Canada each operate a single feed which is distributed in all time zones. This includes all French language channels, as they predominantly serve [[Francophone]] areas of the country, mostly in Quebec (almost all of which observes Eastern Time). Even many long-standing specialty channels with a general entertainment format use a single national feed, though in many cases they will repeat core primetime programming three hours after first broadcast, such that programs can be promoted as airing at the same time in both the Eastern and Pacific time zones.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}\n\nSome specialty channels do operate two separate broadcast feeds for [[Eastern Canada|Eastern]] and Western Canada. The Eastern feed airs programs on an Eastern Time schedule, while the Western feed airs the same programming on a three-hour delay. The separation between feeds is typically implemented at the border between [[Manitoba]] and [[Ontario]], which may result in a program that airs at 10:00&nbsp;p.m. Eastern Time in Ontario not airing in Manitoba until 12:00&nbsp;a.m. CT (whereas an equivalent program in the U.S. would typically be available at 9:00&nbsp;p.m. for Central Time viewers). However, one channel, the [[Aboriginal Peoples Television Network]], implements the separation at the border between Manitoba and Saskatchewan.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}\n\n===Watershed and safe harbour===\nThe [[Canadian Broadcast Standards Council]] (CBSC) applies more restrictive [[Censorship in Canada|censorship]] regulations to broadcast programming shown in prime time, compared to content transmitted after a [[Watershed (broadcasting)#Canada|watershed]] hour beyond which few children would be likely to be watching. This can be problematic if the same content is broadcast simultaneously nationwide, as the 9:00&nbsp;p.m. watershed in Vancouver falls at 12:00&nbsp;a.m. in Toronto and 1:30&nbsp;a.m. in St. John's. LGBT specialty broadcaster [[PrideVision]] was particularly affected as, from its launch in 2001 until 2005, its format included more innocuous entertainment programming aimed at the gay community during the day and in prime time and [[hardcore pornography|hardcore]] [[gay pornography|pornographic]] content in the overnight (with the latter expanding into the mid-evening by 2004). The network's adult programming was spun out into a [[Playmen TV|second channel]] so that the parent network, now [[OutTV]], could broadcast its non-explicit entertainment and lifestyle programming across its entire broadcast day.<ref>{{cite press release|title=PrideVision changing its format in preparation of new adult-only channel|url=http://www.channelcanada.com/Article639.html|website=Channel Canada|accessdate=August 20, 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061028231900/http://www.channelcanada.com/Article639.html|archivedate=October 28, 2006}}</ref>\n\n==In the United States==\n{{Missing information|section|Alaska and Hawaii|date=January 2019}}\n\n===Time zone feeds===\nWith four time zones in the [[contiguous United States]], American broadcast television networks generally broadcast at least two separate feeds to their [[owned-and-operated station]]s and [[network affiliate|affiliates]], as do [[cable channel|cable/satellite channels]]: the \"eastern feed\" that is aired simultaneously in the Eastern and Central Time Zones, and the \"western feed\" that is [[broadcast delay|tape-delayed]] three hours for those in the Pacific Time Zone. This ensures that a program, for example, that airs at 8:00pm ET on the East Coast is also shown locally at 8:00pm PT on the West Coast. Networks may also broadcast a third feed specifically for the Mountain Time Zone, on which programs are usually broadcast on a one-hour delay from the Eastern Time Zone. Otherwise, some stations in the Mountain Time Zone use the western feed, while others get a mix of both the Eastern and Pacific feeds.\n\nThe Eastern Time Zone is commonly used as a '' de facto'' official time for the United States because it includes the nation's capital city, Washington D.C.; the most populous city, New York City; and half of the country's population.<ref>Based on the 2011 population estimate, 46 percent of the American population live in the Eastern time zone, 30 percent in the Central zone; 7 percent in the Mountain zone, and 17 percent in the Pacific zone.</ref>\n\n===Broadcast television===\nEffectively, the East, Mountain and West network feeds allow prime time on [[terrestrial television|broadcast television]] networks to end at 10:00&nbsp;p.m. Central and Mountain and 11:00&nbsp;p.m. Eastern and Pacific. When it first expanded its programming into prime time in April 1987, [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] became the first major broadcast network in the U.S. to offer a \"common prime\" schedule; this type of scheduling subtracts an hour from the prime time schedule, reducing it to two hours on Monday through Saturdays and three hours on Sundays \u2013 ending evening network programming earlier than [[NBC]], [[CBS]] and [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] did \u2013 and continue to do (Fox did expand its Sunday primetime schedule into the 10:00&nbsp;p.m. timeslot in September 1987, before giving back that hour to its stations in September 1993). [[The WB]] and [[UPN]] followed the \"common prime\" scheduling model when they both launched in January 1995; the replacements for those networks, [[The CW]] and the [[MyNetworkTV]] program service, similarly used that model upon their launches in September 2006.\n\nIn 2009, [[PBS]] began using [[Internet server]]s instead of separate feeds for time delaying of its programming to the network's [[network affiliate#Member stations|member stations]]. The servers imitate a delayed program feed, broadcasting the program at the correct airtime as if it were being broadcast via satellite. This was done as PBS had upgraded its main program feed to [[high-definition television|high definition]] (or to [[widescreen]] digital at the very least) in December 2008, but satellite capacity allowed for only Eastern and Pacific time zone feeds, prompting the removal of the Central and Mountain time zone feeds and a shared feed for Alaska and Pacific time zones in February 2009, which created complaints from PBS stations.<ref>{{cite web|title=New servers, not separate feeds, will handle PBS time-zone delays (Idaho Public Television in the News)|url=http://idahoptv.org/press/showStory.cfm?StoryID=40733|website=[[Idaho Public Television]]|date= |accessdate=October 25, 2012}}</ref>\n\n===Cable and satellite television===\nSubscribers to cable or satellite television services may still only receive East Coast feeds for certain channels even if they reside on the West Coast. Some cable channels only offer one broadcast feed, where viewers see the same program in all time zones. For example, until it dropped the program in 2014, [[superstation]]-turned-basic cable channel [[WGN America]] telecast the noon (Central Time) newscast from [[WGN-TV]] in Chicago at 1:00&nbsp;p.m. Eastern in Washington, D.C. and 10:00&nbsp;a.m. Pacific in Los Angeles.\n\nBroadcasters offer East and West Coast feeds of some basic cable channels for viewing in all time zones. The usage of dual feeds of the same channel is a commonplace method for [[pay television|premium channels]] such as [[HBO]], [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]] and [[Starz]], in which the Pacific time zone feed of the primary channel is packaged with the East Coast feed of the main channel and the pay service's multiplex channels (if the premium channel has any). Most commonly, the Eastern and Pacific Time Zone feeds of only the main channel are packaged together, although some providers may also provide both coastal feeds of a premium service's multiplex channels. In some cases, cable networks (such as [[United States cable news|cable news]] and [[List of sports television channels|sports channels]]) \"fake\" the dual feed approach by recycling their same-day prime time programming during the overnight hours on a three (or four) hour cycle; in this case, the programs are automatically rebroadcast at the advertised time (or one hour later) in the Pacific Time Zone.\n\nIn the United States, distant over-the-air broadcast stations affiliated with the six broadcast networks are offered by [[direct-broadcast satellite television|direct-broadcast satellite]] providers as well as [[television receive-only|C-band]] services that do not offer locally based affiliates for most individual markets, allowing viewers to choose between the east and west feeds of a given network. These designated stations are usually owned-and-operated stations and/or affiliates of ABC, NBC, CBS, Fox and The CW located in the Eastern and Pacific Time Zones (usually those based in New York City and Los Angeles such as ABC's respective O&Os [network [[owned-and-operated station|owned-and-operated]]] in those markets, [[WABC-TV]] and [[KABC-TV]]). Dish Network and C-band providers also provide CW and MyNetworkTV affiliates designated as superstations (such as [[WPIX]] in New York and [[KTLA]] in Los Angeles), with Dish mainly making them available in markets where it does not carry a [[low-power broadcasting|low-power]], [[digital subchannel]]-only or non-broadcast affiliate of either network (especially in markets served by The CW's quasi-national feed for areas ranked below #98 in [[Nielsen Media Research]] market rankings, [[The CW Plus]]).{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}\n\nThe country's two major satellite providers \u2013 [[DirecTV]] and [[Dish Network]] \u2013 only offer these de facto coastal feeds in order to provide programming from at least one network to subscribers living in smaller [[media market]]s or rural areas where a network does not have a local affiliate available on the provider, if even presently serving the given location at all. Since the services began offering local network affiliates from additional markets in the early 2000s, many local stations have successfully sued DBS providers to deny access to distant stations carrying programming from the same network as them within their markets. This differs from the subscription television model in Canada, most cable and satellite providers carry distant over-the-air broadcast stations from the U.S. (consisting of both affiliates of the Big Four broadcast networks and minor network affiliates classified as superstations), in addition to O&Os and affiliates of domestically-based networks.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}\n\n===Live events===\n==== News and sports ====\nMost sports television programs, including other major national events, have been broadcast to totality live in all time zones across U.S. territories, but also present special problems for local stations. For such events, the networks may either advertise Eastern time only, or list the times in both Eastern and Pacific (e.g. \"8 p.m. Eastern/5 p.m. Pacific\"). As such, a live Sunday sporting event that is played from 1:00 to 4:00&nbsp;p.m. Pacific Time preempts local 6:00&nbsp;p.m. newscasts on the East Coast. Likewise, a [[State of the Union|State of the Union address]] that is televised at 9:00&nbsp;p.m. Eastern Time preempts local 6:00&nbsp;p.m. newscasts on the West Coast. News channels such as [[CNN]] and sports channels such as [[ESPN]] that frequently broadcast live events offer a single feed that airs in all time zones. About 80 percent of the U.S. population [[East Coast bias|reside in the Central and Eastern time zones]], where the nation's largest city (and the main anchor of television programming) New York is located.<ref>{{cite news|title=Oscars exec producer: 'We need to go for comedy'|url= http://www.cnn.com/2012/02/22/showbiz/tv/oscars-producer-telecast-ew/|first=Lynette|last=Rice|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|publisher=[[Time Inc.]]|via=[[CNN]]|date=February 22, 2012|accessdate=February 22, 2012}}</ref>\n\nA notable exception to live telecasts in sports are the [[Olympic Games]]. Although it has provided live coverage of events during other dayparts via platforms such as cable and streaming, NBC's flagship primetime coverage block typically featured tape-delayed and \"plausibly live\" presentations of events from earlier in the day. When allowed by the host's time zone, NBC did include live coverage of selected events in the block. This practice is reflected in the actual scheduling of the Olympic programme, which NBC may influence to maximize primetime viewership due to the value of its broadcast rights: at the [[2008 Summer Olympics]] in [[Beijing]], many swimming events were held in the morning local time to allow for primetime broadcasts in the Americas).<ref name=\"Guardian2006\">{{cite web | url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2006/jul/16/bbc.media | title=BBC at war over 'mad' Olympic start times | first=Denis | last=Campbell | work=The Observer | publisher=The Guardian | date=July 16, 2006}}</ref> This coverage block was, in turn, aired in tape delay on the West Coast.

The mechanics of the 2014 ABC series ''[[Rising Star (TV series)|Rising Star]]'' \u2014 which allowed for live, real-time voting by viewers \u2013 would allow the insertion of live reaction segments in the event that a contestant eliminated by low vote totals in the original Eastern/Central/Mountain time zone broadcast would be saved by results watching the Pacific/Alaska broadcast, but the show was broadcast live across the [[Contiguous United States|mainland U.S.]] except the Pacific time zone. Moreover, ABC noted that the chances of West Coast votes differing substantially from other viewers was statistically small.<ref>{{cite web|title='Rising Star' Producers Consulted Mathematicians Over Time Zone Dilemma|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/rising-star-producers-consulted-mathematicians-707878|author=Michael O'Connell|periodical=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|date=May 29, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title='Rising Star' Producers On How Interactive Talent Show Will Tackle U.S.' 4 Time Zones|url=https://www.deadline.com/2014/05/rising-star-producers-on-how-interractive-talent-show-will-tackle-u-s-4-time-zones/|author=Nellie Andreeva|website=[[Deadline Hollywood]]|publisher=[[Penske Media Corporation]]|date=May 29, 2014}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Academy Awards]], up until the early 21st century, was the only major U.S. entertainment television event to have been aired live to all continental U.S. time zones, but with a tape delay for viewers in Hawaii. Beginning the late 2000s, however, several award shows, such as the [[Golden Globes Awards]] and [[Billboard Music Awards]], joined the Oscars in conducting the same format of live broadcasts in response to longstanding general criticisms from the multimedia industry and viewers alike on some live shows televised real-time to the East Coast but are being [[broadcast delay|tape-delayed]] for West Coast viewers, albeit the fact that some of them originate from Los Angeles area. This is to cater for viewers in the Alaskan, Pacific and Mountain time zones who have frequently complained about [[spoiler (media)|spoiler]]s made by live viewers east of the Rockies during the broadcasts.\n\nThe [[Grammy Awards]] historically delayed its live ceremonies for West Coast viewers. However, starting 2016, the award show's rightsholder, CBS, began to allow its stations in the Western U.S. to carry the ceremony live as long as they also carry a prime time rebroadcast.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.vulture.com/2016/01/grammys-live-west-coast.html|title=For the First Time Ever, the West Coast Can Watch the Grammys Live, Too|last=Adalian|first=Josef|date=19 January 2016|work=[[New York (magazine)|Vulture]]|accessdate=6 February 2016}}</ref> Starting in 2017, CBS aired the Grammys live all across the U.S. (inclusive of time zones outside the contiguous U.S.), with a required primetime encore for viewers outside the Eastern and Central time zones. Despite shifting broadcast sources between Los Angeles and New York since [[60th Annual Grammy Awards|2018]], the Grammys continued to use the format, making it the first major award show to have aired live across all U.S. time zones.\n\nAlthough the [[Primetime Emmy Awards]], currently aired on rotation by ABC, CBS, Fox and NBC, began airing live coast-to-coast in the U.S. in 2010, the awards show followed suit with the Grammys in airing live simultaneously outside the contiguous U.S. time zones with CBS' telecast in 2017. The [[Tony Awards]] (which are usually broadcast live from New York City) remain the only [[EGOT (disambiguation)|major award]] show to have never conducted live coast-to-coast telecasts.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bustle.com/articles/88596-when-will-the-tonys-air-on-the-west-coast-heres-exactly-when-you-can-watch|title=When Will The Tonys Air On The West Coast?|first=Mallory|last=Carra|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nSome lower-tiered special music telecasts that originate from Los Angeles, such as the [[American Music Awards]], [[People's Choice Awards]] and [[Teen Choice Awards]], remain airing live in the East Coast and tape-delayed for the West Coast as their airtime is often purchased as a [[brokered programming]] arrangement, which also allows [[standards and practices]] to watch the ceremony in advance and determine cuts for profanity or content to insert a [[bleep censor]] or cut-away, and the producers cuts for time and superfluous items such as longer walks than expected by an award winner to the stage or a rare botched performance with the replacement of [[dress rehearsal]] footage. Some technically complicated ceremonies, such as the [[MTV Video Music Awards]], are usually edited before being recorded for broadcast on separate local primetime slots for both coasts.\n\n[[New Year's Eve]] specials covering [[Times Square Ball|Times Square's ball drop]] in New York City are typically tape delayed or encored for the west coast so that the countdown will correspond with the local time zone. As with primetime programming, they are typically broadcast live in the Eastern and Central time zones. Some affiliates may preempt the late-night segment of the networked special in order to broadcast local celebrations (such as Seattle's [[KING-TV]], which preempts the already tape-delayed ''[[NBC's New Year's Eve]]'' to broadcast coverage of midnight fireworks on the [[Space Needle]]),<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.seattletimes.com/entertainment/tv/tv-picks-for-monday-new-years-at-the-needle-on-king/|title=TV Picks for Monday: \u2018New Year\u2019s at The Needle\u2019 on KING|date=2018-12-31|website=The Seattle Times|language=en-US|access-date=2019-10-15}}</ref> and it is not uncommon for stations in Central Time to air a local New Year's special immediately after the conclusion of the network special, especially if it does not produce additional coverage focused on the area (such as ABC's ''[[New Year's Rockin' Eve]]'', which since 2017 has featured segments and coverage of midnight celebrations in [[New Orleans]],<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://deadline.com/2016/12/abc-ryan-seacrest-dick-clarks-new-years-rockin-eve-2017-1201864283/|title=\u2018Dick Clark\u2019s New Year\u2019s Rockin\u2019 Eve\u2019 Heads To New Orleans For First-Ever Live Central Time Zone Countdown|last=Lincoln|first=Ross A.|last2=Lincoln|first2=Ross A.|date=2016-12-05|website=Deadline|language=en|access-date=2019-10-15}}</ref> and ''[[Late Night with Conan O'Brien]]'', which did so to lampoon the [[East Coast bias|bias]] towards New York in New Year's coverage).<ref>{{cite web|title=Why Party Like It's 1999?|url=http://archive.southcoasttoday.com/daily/12-97/12-31-97/b01li062.htm|author=Frazier Moore|agency=[[Associated Press]]|newspaper=[[The Standard-Times (New Bedford)|The Standard-Times]]|publisher=The Standard-Times Company|date=December 31, 1997|accessdate=October 25, 2012}}</ref> A similar case was also done with NBC's coverage of [[Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade]] in New York City where it is live in the Eastern time zone (as well as Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands as they use the Eastern Time Zone Feed) but taped delayed in timezones west of Eastern Time so it starts at exactly at 9 PM in their respective local times.\n\nOccasionally, networks will produce and broadcast the same live event twice in one night \u2013 broadcasting once on an East Coast feed, and again on a West Coast feed three hours later. This permits more viewers to watch the broadcast live in prime time (although not all), as the show can air in its usual timeslot in all markets, but incurs the expense and difficulty of delivering two live broadcasts. In some cases, the two broadcasts may intentionally differ, prompting fans to compare notes and post scenes from each version online. While rare, the technique of multiple live broadcasts has been not uncommon for some special live episodes of scripted programs since the late 1990s, such as the ''[[30 Rock]]'' episodes \"[[Live Show]]\" and \"[[Live from Studio 6H]]\", ''[[Will & Grace]]'' with \"[[Alive and Schticking]]\", ''[[The West Wing]]'' with \"The Debate\", and ''[[ER (TV series)|ER]]'''s fourth-season debut with \"Ambush\".\n\nFew regularly scheduled prime time shows, both scripted and non-scripted, and sports and non-sports in genre, have been aired to totality at the same time live across all continental U.S. time zones. This format, similar to aforementioned major awards shows, involves airing live on prime time or late night in the East Coast (and late afternoon hours or on prime time, simultaneously and respectively, on the West Coast). NBC remains the foremost proponent of live television, with its broadcasts of ''[[NBC Sunday Night Football|Sunday Night Football]]'' and ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' being transmitted live across the contiguous U.S. states (and for the former, including for U.S. time zones outside the mainland), with a corresponding prime time or late-night encore for viewers outside the Eastern and Central time zones.\n\nIn mid-2018, ''[[American Idol]]'' became the first ever reality competition series \u2013 and first ever non-weekend regularly scheduled prime time program \u2013 in all of U.S. television to broadcast live<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://deadline.com/2018/04/american-idol-first-simulcast-will-allow-live-voting-across-the-us-1202373605/ |title=\u2018American Idol\u2019 First: Simulcast Will Allow Live Voting Across The US |last=Haring|first=Bruce|date=April 23, 2018|website=Deadline Hollywood |language=en-US |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180423153501/http://deadline.com/2018/04/american-idol-first-simulcast-will-allow-live-voting-across-the-us-1202373605/ |archive-date=April 23, 2018|url-status=live|access-date=April 23, 2018}}</ref> in all U.S. territories upon its revival on ABC after its [[American Idol (season 15)|initial first-run finale]] on Fox in 2016, beginning with its live shows in the final stages of the competition.

Despite the format having been in place for the show since [[American Idol (season 14)|2015]], as part of its nationwide voting expansion, a corresponding warning for viewers outside the Eastern and Central time zones regarding the closing of the voting window will be aired upon their local prime time encore broadcasts.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/american-idol-air-nationwide-live-telecasts-first-time-1104877 |title='American Idol' to Air Nationwide Live Telecasts for First Time |last=Strause|first=Jackie|date=April 23, 2018|website=The Hollywood Reporter |language=en-US |access-date=May 5, 2018}}</ref> The format would eventually extend to include the season finale round beginning [[American Idol (season 17)|2019]], making it the first ever primetime regular series in U.S. television history to air its season finale live all across the U.S.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://abc.go.com/shows/american-idol/news/updates/american-idol-2019-live-coast-to-coast-simul-vote |title=American Idol 2019 Live Viewing Coast-to-Coast & Simul-Vote Details |last=Barton|first=Amy|date=March 18, 2019|website=abc.go |language=en-US |access-date=April 3, 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Effects on local programming===\n{{unreferenced section|date=July 2018}}\nLocal stations and affiliates must schedule their local and [[broadcast syndication|syndicated]] programming around their respective network's feed. Because primetime programs on the East Coast feed are simulcast in two time zones, stations in the Central Time Zone are affected differently from those in the Eastern Time Zone. An hour of syndicated programming time (between 7:00 and 8:00&nbsp;p.m. in the Eastern and Pacific time zones) is lost in the Central and Mountain time zones since network primetime in those areas starts at 7:00&nbsp;p.m., forcing stations in Mountain or Central time (or in parts of both zones) to choose between airing their 6:00&nbsp;p.m. newscast and another syndicated or locally produced program or airing shows in \"blocks\" preferred by syndicators (for example, ''[[Wheel of Fortune (U.S. game show)|Wheel of Fortune]]'' and ''[[Jeopardy!]]'' together or ''[[Entertainment Tonight]]'' and ''[[The Insider (TV series)|The Insider]]'' together).\n\nThe most common set of programming chosen by stations aligned with the [[Big Three television networks]] (ABC, CBS and NBC) is to air a local newscast at 5:00&nbsp;p.m., national news at 5:30&nbsp;p.m., another local newscast at 6:00&nbsp;p.m. and syndicated programming at 6:30&nbsp;p.m., though some Fox stations that maintain a newscast schedule comparable to stations tied to the Big Three (commonly stations that were former ABC, NBC and CBS affiliates themselves) carry a 60- or 90-minute block of news from 5:00 to 6:00 (or 6:30) p.m. with an additional half-hour of local news in the 5:30&nbsp;p.m. timeslot as Fox does not air a national evening newscast; a few stations not affiliated with the Big Four networks, such as WGN-TV, KTLA in Los Angeles and [[WJXT]] in [[Jacksonville, Florida|Jacksonville]], Florida, follow a similar scheduling format with their early evening newscasts. Most Big Three affiliates in the Eastern and Pacific time zones follow this early evening newscast model as well, running a 90-minute block of news from 5:00 to 6:30&nbsp;p.m., particularly if they run a network's national evening newscast at 6:30&nbsp;p.m. Eastern and Pacific Time. Some stations, regardless of time zone, even show a newscast from 6:00 to 7:00&nbsp;p.m., which if run on a network station in the Central or Mountain time zones would lead into primetime network programming. Some television stations (such as [[WKYC]] and [[WJW (TV)|WJW]] in [[Cleveland]], Ohio, or [[WJAR]] in [[Providence, Rhode Island|Providence]], Rhode Island) have recently begun using the fact that primetime in the Eastern Time Zone begins at 8:00&nbsp;p.m. to their advantage by carrying a newscast during the 7:00&nbsp;p.m. hour, generally in order to attract viewers who work longer days and cannot return home to watch a 5:00 or 6:00&nbsp;p.m. newscast.\n\nMany stations that do not carry a newscast in the 6:00&nbsp;p.m. timeslot in the Central Time Zone (commonly [[Independent station (North America)|independent stations]] and most affiliates of non-historical networks like Fox \u2013 which has some stations that air a 6:00&nbsp;p.m. newscast, though this is not entirely commonplace \u2013 [[The CW]] and [[MyNetworkTV]]) air situation comedies or other types of syndicated programming, such as [[reality television|reality series]] or game shows, during that hour. Many stations in the Central Time Zone tend to air one or both parts of the syndicated block at 5:00&nbsp;p.m. or even earlier. Another more recent dilemma of the 7:00&nbsp;p.m. primetime start is that a combination of longer commutes and work hours than in the past have caused many people to not come home from work until after 7:00&nbsp;p.m., cutting into the potential ratings of shows that start at this time. Of course, the reverse is also true since simultaneous broadcasts offer viewers the chance to watch \"prime time television\" without having to stay awake until 11:00&nbsp;p.m.\n\n[[Local programming]] such as [[news broadcasting#television|locally produced newscasts]] are not typically affected as many stations air their morning newscast at 4:00, 4:30, 5:00 or 5:30&nbsp;a.m., and their early evening newscasts at 5:00 and/or 6:00&nbsp;p.m.; however, the late evening newscast is affected due to the differences in time between time zones, meaning that if the late local news starts at 10:00&nbsp;p.m. Central time on one network station, an affiliate of the same network in the Eastern Time Zone airs its newscast at 11:00&nbsp;p.m.; network evening newscasts on CBS, ABC, and NBC are affected since they are usually scheduled to air at 6:30&nbsp;p.m. Eastern Time (barring preemption due to network sports coverage or at the discretion of the local station, breaking news or [[severe weather]] coverage) in order to sync up with its simultaneous broadcast in the Central Time Zone. Midday newscasts are not necessarily affected, depending on whether the station's affiliated network schedules their daytime lineup simultaneously in the Eastern and Central Time Zones (as with ABC and CBS) or just to the Eastern Time Zone first (as with NBC). The late night program lineups on ABC, CBS, NBC and Fox are also similarly timeshifted, airing a half-hour later (after a newscast or syndicated programming if the station does not run news programming) but are shifted due to the time zone differences (a bigger issue with first-run late night programs that air after 12:30&nbsp;a.m. Eastern Time since the later start time may subject these programs to a potentially decreased audience). Many Fox, CW and MyNetworkTV affiliates, and some independent stations carry a prime time newscast that is similarly affected by the timeshifting of the prime time schedule, meaning that if said late evening newscast starts at 9:00&nbsp;p.m. Mountain Time on one network station, an affiliate of the same network in the Pacific time zone would air its news at 10:00&nbsp;p.m.\n\n==See also==\n*[[East Coast bias]]\n*[[Time shifting]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n[[Category:Television terminology]]\n[[Category:Television programming|Tim]]\n[[Category:Canadian television schedules|Tim]]\n[[Category:United States television schedules|Tim]]\n[[Category:Television in the United States]]\n[[Category:Television in Canada]]\n[[Category:Television in Mexico]]\n[[Category:Time in the United States]]\n[[Category:Radio in the United States]]\n[[Category:Radio in Canada]]\n[[Category:Time in Canada]]\n", "name_user": "20chances", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eEntertainment", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effects_of_time_zones_on_North_American_broadcasting"}

Opened in 1956 as the first mall in the Cincinnati area, it was initially an open-air complex featuring Rollman & Sons department store as the sole [[anchor store]]. This store was converted to [[Mabley & Carew]] in 1960, and again to [[Elder-Beerman]] in 1978. The mall had undergone a severe decline in tenancy by the early 1980s, and was renovated in 1985 by the [[Edward J. DeBartolo Sr.|Edward J. DeBartolo]] corporation as Swifton Commons. Despite initial success, the renovated mall underwent another severe decline in tenancy by the mid-1990s. [[Allen Temple AME Church (Cincinnati, Ohio)|Allen Temple AME Church]] bought the mall and renamed it to Jordan Crossing, replacing many of the inline tenants with offices. By 2013, the mall was demolished except for offices in the former location of Elder-Beerman.\n\n==History==\nRetail developer [[Jonathan Woodner]] first announced plans for Swifton Center in 1951, and sold his stake in the mall to Stahl Development in 1954.<ref name=\"city\"/> The site chosen for the center was the southeast corner of Reading Road ([[U.S. Route 42]]) and Seymour Avenue ([[Ohio State Route 561|SR 561]]) within the city limits of [[Cincinnati, Ohio]], a site determined by market analysts to be the [[center of population]] for the Cincinnati market at the time. It would also be the first shopping mall in the Cincinnati area.<ref name=\"city\"/> Plans for the center called for approximately 54 tenants lining both sides of an open-air concourse, along with parking for over 3,000 cars and a service tunnel for delivery trucks underneath the center. A branch of the local department store Rollman & Sons (then owned by [[Allied Stores]]), which also operated a store in downtown Cincinnati at the time, would serve as the [[anchor store]] at the south end. The mall would overall consist of just under {{convert|600000|sqft|m2}} of shop space on {{convert|41|acre|ha}} of land.<ref name=\"city\"/> Overall building costs for the center were estimated at $12 million.<ref name=\"stahl\"/> Stahl Development and Sun Construction Company were announced as the mall's developers, with Frederick A.

DeBartolo Sr.|Edward J. DeBartolo Corporation]] purchased the mall in 1985, renaming it to Swifton Commons. DeBartolo renovated the mall's exterior and brought in new tenants such as [[Lane Bryant]], [[Waldenbooks]], and [[Gold Star Chili]], along with a [[food court]]. At the time, representatives of both Glazer and DeBartolo noted that the mall's decline was due to a perception of [[white flight]] in the surrounding neighborhoods, a claim which they felt was unsubstantiated since many of the former mall tenants such as Kroger and Walgreens had relocated across the street and not left the neighborhood entirely. Another factor in the mall's decline prior to the mid-1980s was a lack of [[escalation clause]] in the leases of original tenants, which in turn resulted in deferred maintenance of the property and an inability to attract new tenants in order to stay competitive with other area malls.<ref>{{cite journal | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UB8DAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA30&lpg=PA30&dq=swifton+center+cincinnati%5D&source=bl&ots=OYiuSUPVc3&sig=ACfU3U0CBQBlX76MpcaFQw8nr1QYNA4NYw&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwik5ZOwsvvjAhWPVc0KHYm2CJ0Q6AEwCXoECC4QAQ#v=onepage&q=swifton%20center%20cincinnati%5D&f=false | title=Can Swifton be saved? | author=Greg Evans | journal=Cincinnati Magazine | pages=30-35 | date=June 1985}}</ref> DeBartolo had been selected by Glazer Enterprises owner Jerome Glazer to assist in mall renovations, and had gotten nearly $7 million in city grants to undergo renovations.

At the time, representatives of both Glazer and DeBartolo noted that the mall's decline was due to a perception of [[white flight]] in the surrounding neighborhoods, a claim which they felt was unsubstantiated since many of the former mall tenants such as Kroger and Walgreens had relocated across the street and not left the neighborhood entirely. Another factor in the mall's decline prior to the mid-1980s was a lack of [[escalation clause]] in the leases of original tenants, which in turn resulted in deferred maintenance of the property and an inability to attract new tenants in order to stay competitive with other area malls.<ref>{{cite journal | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UB8DAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA30&lpg=PA30&dq=swifton+center+cincinnati%5D&source=bl&ots=OYiuSUPVc3&sig=ACfU3U0CBQBlX76MpcaFQw8nr1QYNA4NYw&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwik5ZOwsvvjAhWPVc0KHYm2CJ0Q6AEwCXoECC4QAQ#v=onepage&q=swifton%20center%20cincinnati%5D&f=false | title=Can Swifton be saved? | author=Greg Evans | journal=Cincinnati Magazine | pages=30-35 | date=June 1985}}</ref> DeBartolo had been selected by Glazer Enterprises owner Jerome Glazer to assist in mall renovations, and had gotten nearly $7 million in city grants to undergo renovations.

Other forms involve [[materialization (paranormal)|materializations]] of the spirit or the presence of a voice, and [[psychokinesis|telekinetic]] activity.\n\nThe practice is associated with several [[religious belief|religious-belief]] systems such as [[Shamanism]], [[West African Vodun|Vodun]], [[Spiritualism]], [[Spiritism]], [[Candombl\u00e9]], [[Haitian Vodou|Voodoo]], [[Umbanda]] and some [[New Age]] groups.\n\n== Concept ==\nIn [[Spiritism]] and [[Spiritualism]] the medium has the role of an intermediary between the world of the living and the world of spirit. Mediums claim that they can listen to and relay messages from spirits, or that they can allow a spirit to control their body and speak through it directly or by using [[automatic writing]] or [[automatic drawing|drawing]].\n\nSpiritualists classify types of mediumship into two main categories: \"mental\" and \"physical\":<ref>Imagine Spirit (2019).

The story of the [[Witch of Endor]] (In the most recent edition of the [[NIV]] witch is rendered medium in the passage) tells of one who raised the spirit of the deceased prophet [[Samuel (Bible)|Samuel]] to allow the Hebrew king [[Saul]] to question his former mentor about an upcoming battle, as related in the [[Books of Samuel]] in the [[Jewish]] [[Tanakh]] (the basis of the [[Old Testament]]).\n\nMediumship became quite popular in the 19th-century United States and the [[United Kingdom]] after the rise of Spiritualism as a religious movement. Modern Spiritualism is said to date from practices and lectures of the [[Fox sisters]] in [[New York (state)|New York]] State in 1848. The trance mediums [[Paschal Beverly Randolph]] and [[Emma Hardinge Britten]] were among the most celebrated lecturers and authors on the subject in the mid-19th century.  [[Allan Kardec]] coined the term Spiritism around 1860.<ref name=\"aks\">\"Spiritism is not a religion but a science\", as the famous French astronomer Camille Flammarion said in Allan Kardec's Eulogy on April 2, 1869, in ''Death and Its Mystery \u2013 After Death. Manifestations and Apparitions of the Dead; The Soul After Death'' Translated by Latrobe Carroll (London: Adelphi Terrace, 1923), archive version at [https://web.archive.org/web/20090706000819/http://www.survivalafterdeath.org.uk/articles/flammarion/manifestations.htm Allan Kardec eulogy]</ref> Kardec claimed that conversations with spirits by selected mediums were the basis of his ''The Spirits' Book'' and later, his five-book collection, ''[[Spiritist Codification]]''.\n\nSome scientists of the period who investigated Spiritualism also became converts. They included chemist [[Robert Hare (chemist)|Robert Hare]], physicist [[William Crookes#Spiritualism|William Crookes]] (1832\u20131919) and evolutionary biologist [[Alfred Russel Wallace#Spiritualism|Alfred Russel Wallace]] (1823\u20131913).<ref>[[Ruth Brandon|Brandon, Ruth]].

Aquarian Press.</ref>\n\nAfter the exposure of the fraudulent use of [[magic (illusion)|stage magic tricks]] by physical mediums such as the [[Davenport Brothers]] and the [[Bangs Sisters]], mediumship fell into disrepute. However, the religion and its beliefs continue in spite of this, with physical mediumship and seances falling out of practice and platform mediumship coming to the fore.\n\nIn the late 1920s and early 1930s there were around one quarter of a million practising Spiritualists and some two thousand Spiritualist societies in the UK in addition to flourishing microcultures of platform mediumship and 'home circles'.<ref>Sutcliffe, Steven J. (2002). Children of the New Age. p. 35.</ref> Spiritualism continues to be practised, primarily through various denominational Spiritualist churches in the United States, Canada, Australia and the United Kingdom. In the United Kingdom, over 340 Spiritualist churches and centres open their doors to the public and free demonstrations of mediumship are regularly performed.<ref>[http://www.snu.org.uk/snu/about.html \"The SNU\"].</ref>\n\n== Terminology ==\n\n=== Spirit guide ===\n{{Main|Spirit guide}}\nIn 1958, the [[England|English]]-born Spiritualist C. Dorreen Phillips wrote of her experiences with a medium at [[Camp Chesterfield]], [[Indiana]]: \"In Rev. James Laughton's s\u00e9ances there are many [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Indians]]. They are very noisy and appear to have great power. [...] The little guides, or doorkeepers, are usually Indian boys and girls [who act] as messengers who help to locate the spirit friends who wish to speak with you.\"<ref name=\"Phillips\">''The Autobiography of a Fortune Teller'' by C. Doreen Phillips, Vantage Press, 1958.</ref>\n\n=== Spirit operator ===\nA spirit who uses a medium to manipulate psychic \"energy\" or \"energy systems.\"\n\n=== Demonstrations of mediumship ===\n[[File:Colin Evans fraud in 1938.jpg|thumb|right|[[Colin Evans (medium)|Colin Evans]], who claimed spirits lifted him into the air, was exposed as a fraud.]]\nIn old-line Spiritualism, a portion of the services, generally toward the end, is given over to demonstrations of mediumship through contact with the spirits of the dead. A typical example of this way of describing a mediumistic church service is found in the 1958 autobiography of C. Dorreen Phillips. She writes of the worship services at the Spiritualist [[Camp Chesterfield]] in [[Chesterfield, Indiana]]: \"Services are held each afternoon, consisting of hymns, a lecture on philosophy, and demonstrations of mediumship.\"<ref name=\"Phillips\" />\n\nToday \"demonstration of mediumship\" is part of the church service at all churches affiliated with the [[National Spiritualist Association of Churches]] (NSAC) and the [[Spiritualists' National Union]] (SNU). Demonstration links to NSAC's Declaration of Principal #9. \"We affirm that the precepts of Prophecy and Healing are Divine attributes proven through Mediumship.\"\n\n=== Mental mediumship ===\n\"Mental mediumship\" is communication of spirits with a medium by [[telepathy]]. The medium mentally \"hears\" (clairaudience), \"sees\" (clairvoyance), and/or feels (clairsentience) messages from spirits. Directly or with the help of a spirit guide, the medium passes the information on to the message's recipient(s). When a medium is doing a \"reading\" for a particular person, that person is known as the \"sitter\".\n\n=== Trance mediumship ===\n\"Trance mediumship\" is often seen as a form of mental mediumship. Most trance mediums remain conscious during a communication period, wherein a spirit uses the medium's mind to communicate. The spirit or spirits using the medium's mind influences the mind with the thoughts being conveyed. The medium allows the [[Id, ego and super-ego|ego]] to step aside for the message to be delivered. At the same time, one has awareness of the thoughts coming through and may even influence the message with one's own bias. Such a trance is not to be confused with [[sleepwalking]], as the patterns are entirely different. Castillo (1995) states,\n{{quote|Trance phenomena result from the behavior of intense focusing of attention, which is the key psychological mechanism of trance induction. Adaptive responses, including institutionalized forms of trance, are 'tuned' into neural networks in the brain.<ref>Richard Castillo (1995) ''Culture, Trance, and the Mind-Brain''. Anthropology of Consciousness. Volume 6, Issue 1, pp. 17\u201334, March 1995.</ref>}}\n\nIn the 1860s and 1870s, trance mediums were very popular. Spiritualism generally attracted female adherents, many who had strong interests in social justice. Many trance mediums delivered passionate speeches on [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionism]], [[temperance movement|temperance]], and [[women's suffrage]].<ref>Braude, Anne, ''Radical Spirits, Spiritualism and Women's Rights in Nineteenth Century America''. Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 2001.</ref> Scholars have described [[Leonora Piper]] as one of the most famous trance mediums in the history of Spiritualism.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/><ref>Deborah Blum. (2006). ''Ghost Hunters, William James and the Search for Scientific Proof of Life After Death''. The Penguin Press.</ref><ref>[[Amy Tanner]]. (1994, originally published 1910). ''Studies in Spiritism''. With an introduction by [[G. Stanley Hall]]. Prometheus Press. p. 18</ref>\n\nIn the typical deep trance, the medium may not have clear recall of all the messages conveyed while in an altered state; such people generally work with an assistant. That person selectively wrote down or otherwise recorded the medium's words.  Rarely did the assistant record the responding words of the sitter and other attendants. An example of this kind of relationship can be found in the early 20th century collaboration between the trance medium Mrs. Cecil M. Cook of the [[William T. Stead]] Memorial Center in Chicago (a religious body incorporated under the statutes of the State of Illinois) and the journalist [[Lloyd Kenyon Jones]]. The latter was a non-medium Spiritualist who transcribed Cook's messages in [[shorthand]]. He [[edited]] them for publication in book and pamphlet form.<ref>''God's World: A Treatise on Spiritualism Founded on Transcripts of Shorthand Notes Taken Down, Over a Period of Five Years, in the Seance-Room of the William T. Stead Memorial Center (a Religious Body Incorporated Under the Statutes of the State of Illinois)'', Mrs. Cecil M. Cook, Medium and Pastor. Compiled and Written by Lloyd Kenyon Jones. Chicago, Ill.: The William T. Stead Memorial Center, 1919.</ref>\n\n=== Physical mediumship ===\n[[File:Seance Doll.jpg|thumb|left|A photograph of the medium [[Linda Gazzera]] with a doll as fake ectoplasm.]]\nPhysical mediumship is defined as manipulation of energies and energy systems by spirits. This type of mediumship is claimed to involve perceptible manifestations, such as loud raps and noises, voices, materialized objects, apports, materialized spirit bodies, or body parts such as hands, legs and feet. The medium is used as a source of power for such spirit manifestations. By some accounts, this was achieved by using the energy or ectoplasm released by a medium, see [[spirit photography]].<ref>[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/ectoplasm \"Ectoplasm\" def. Merriam Webster dictionary], Retrieved 18 January 2007</ref><ref>Somerlott, Robert, ''Here, Mr. Splitfoot''. Viking, 1971.</ref> The last physical medium to be tested by a committee from ''[[Scientific American]]'' was [[Mina Crandon]] in 1924.\n\nMost physical mediumship is presented in a darkened or dimly lit room. Most physical mediums make use of a traditional array of tools and appurtenances, including spirit trumpets, spirit cabinets, and levitation tables.\n{{clear}}\n\n=== Direct voice ===\nDirect voice communication is the claim that spirits speak independently of the medium, who facilitates the phenomenon rather than produces it. The role of the medium is to make the connection between the physical and spirit worlds. Trumpets are often utilised to amplify the signal, and directed voice mediums are sometimes known as \"trumpet mediums\". This form of mediumship also permits the medium to participate in the discourse during s\u00e9ances, since the medium's voice is not required by the spirit to communicate. [[Leslie Flint]] was one of the best known exponents of this form of mediumship.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Connor |first=Steven |year=1999 |chapter=9.

One type involved [[clairaudience]] or sensitives who hear spirit, and then relay what they hear to their clients.<ref>{{cite web|title=What is a psychic?|url=http://www.ukpsychicreadings.co.uk/what-is-a-psychic/|publisher=UK Psychic Readings|accessdate=30 July 2013}}</ref> The other incarnation of non-physical mediumship is a form of channeling in which the channeler goes into a trance, or \"leaves their body\", allowing a spirit entity to borrow their body, who then speaks through them.<ref name=\"Wood\">{{cite book\n | last = Wood\n | first = Matthew\n | title = Possession Power and the New Age: Ambiguities of Authority in Neoliberal Societies\n | year = 2007\n | publisher = Ashgate Publishing, Limited\n | isbn = 978-0-7546-3339-6\n}}</ref> When in a trance the medium appears to come under the control of the spirit of a departed soul, sometimes entering into a [[cataleptic]] state,<ref name=\"LeCron\">{{cite book\n | last = LeCron\n | first = Leslie\n | last2 =  Bordeaux\n | first2 = Jean\n | title = Hypnotism Today\n | year = 1970\n | quote = When in a trance&nbsp;... the medium seems to come under the control of another personality, purportedly the spirit of a departed soul, and a genuine medium undoubtedly believes the 'control' to be a spirit entity&nbsp;...

A medium is said to have psychic abilities but not all psychics function as mediums. The term ''clairvoyance'', for instance, may include seeing spirit and visions instilled by the spirit world.  The Parapsychological Association defines \"clairvoyance\" as information derived directly from an external physical source.<ref>[http://parapsych.org/glossary_a_d.html#c \"Glossary of Key Words Frequently Used in Parapsychology\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101120215806/http://www.parapsych.org/glossary_a_d.html |date=2010-11-20 }}, Parapsychological Association website, Retrieved January 29, 2007</ref>\n* [[Clairvoyance]] or \"clear seeing\", is the ability to see anything that is not physically present, such as objects, animals or people. This sight occurs \"in the mind's eye\".  Some mediums say that this is their normal vision state. Others say that they must train their minds with such practices as meditation in order to achieve this ability, and that assistance from spiritual helpers is often necessary. Some clairvoyant mediums can see a spirit as though the spirit has a physical body. They see the bodily form as if it were physically present. Other mediums see the spirit in their mind's eye, or it appears as a movie or a television programme or a still picture like a photograph in their mind.\n* [[Clairaudience]] or \"clear hearing\", is usually defined as the ability to hear the voices or thoughts of spirits. Some mediums hear as though they are listening to a person talking to them on the outside of their head, as though the Spirit is next to or near to the medium, and other mediums hear the voices in their minds as a verbal thought.\n* [[Clairsentience]] or \"clear sensing\", is the ability to have an impression of what a spirit wants to communicate, or to feel sensations instilled by a spirit.\n* [[Clairvoyance|Clairsentinence]] or \"clear feeling\" is a condition in which the medium takes on the ailments of a spirit, feeling the same physical problem which the spirit person had before death.\n* [[Clairalience]] or \"clear smelling\" is the ability to smell a spirit. For example, a medium may smell the pipe tobacco of a person who smoked during life.\n* [[Clairgustance]] or \"clear tasting\" is the ability to receive taste impressions from a spirit.\n* [[Claircognizance]] or \"clear knowing\", is the ability to know something without receiving it through normal or psychic senses.  It is a feeling of \"just knowing\".  Often, a medium will claim to have the feeling that a message or situation is \"right\" or \"wrong.\"\n\n== Explanations ==\n=== Paranormal belief ===\nSpiritualists believe that phenomena produced by mediums (both mental and physical mediumship) are the result of external [[spirit]] agencies.<ref>Ilya Vinitsky.

After the seance, approximately one third of the participants incorrectly reported that the table had moved. The results showed a greater percentage of believers reporting that the table had moved. In another experiment the believers had also reported that a handbell had moved when it had remained stationary and expressed their belief that the fake s\u00e9ances contained genuine paranormal phenomena.

Home's usual phenomena were messages, the moving of objects (presumably at a distance), and the playing of an accordion which he held with one hand under the shadow of the table. But from an early date in America he had been accustomed occasionally to \"materialise\" hands (as it was afterwards called). The sitters would, in the darkness, faintly see a ghostly hand and arm, or they might feel the touch of an icy limb. Mr. Merrifield and the other sitters saw a \"spirit-hand\" stretch across the faintly lit space of the window. But Mr. Merrifield says that Home sat, or crouched, low in a low chair, and that the \"spirit-hand\" was a false limb on the end of Home's arm.

Other forms involve [[materialization (paranormal)|materializations]] of the spirit or the presence of a voice, and [[psychokinesis|telekinetic]] activity.\n\nThe practice is associated with several [[religious belief|religious-belief]] systems such as [[Shamanism]], [[West African Vodun|Vodun]], [[Spiritualism]], [[Spiritism]], [[Candombl\u00e9]], [[Haitian Vodou|Voodoo]], [[Umbanda]] and some [[New Age]] groups.\n\n== Concept ==\nIn [[Spiritism]] and [[Spiritualism]] the medium has the role of an intermediary between the world of the living and the world of spirit. Mediums claim that they can listen to and relay messages from spirits, or that they can allow a spirit to control their body and speak through it directly or by using [[automatic writing]] or [[automatic drawing|drawing]].\n\nSpiritualists classify types of mediumship into two main categories: \"mental\" and \"physical\":<ref>Imagine Spirit (2019).

The story of the [[Witch of Endor]] (In the most recent edition of the [[NIV]] witch is rendered medium in the passage) tells of one who raised the spirit of the deceased prophet [[Samuel (Bible)|Samuel]] to allow the Hebrew king [[Saul]] to question his former mentor about an upcoming battle, as related in the [[Books of Samuel]] in the [[Jewish]] [[Tanakh]] (the basis of the [[Old Testament]]).\n\nMediumship became quite popular in the 19th-century United States and the [[United Kingdom]] after the rise of Spiritualism as a religious movement. Modern Spiritualism is said to date from practices and lectures of the [[Fox sisters]] in [[New York (state)|New York]] State in 1848. The trance mediums [[Paschal Beverly Randolph]] and [[Emma Hardinge Britten]] were among the most celebrated lecturers and authors on the subject in the mid-19th century.  [[Allan Kardec]] coined the term Spiritism around 1860.<ref name=\"aks\">\"Spiritism is not a religion but a science\", as the famous French astronomer Camille Flammarion said in Allan Kardec's Eulogy on April 2, 1869, in ''Death and Its Mystery \u2013 After Death. Manifestations and Apparitions of the Dead; The Soul After Death'' Translated by Latrobe Carroll (London: Adelphi Terrace, 1923), archive version at [https://web.archive.org/web/20090706000819/http://www.survivalafterdeath.org.uk/articles/flammarion/manifestations.htm Allan Kardec eulogy]</ref> Kardec claimed that conversations with spirits by selected mediums were the basis of his ''The Spirits' Book'' and later, his five-book collection, ''[[Spiritist Codification]]''.\n\nSome scientists of the period who investigated Spiritualism also became converts. They included chemist [[Robert Hare (chemist)|Robert Hare]], physicist [[William Crookes#Spiritualism|William Crookes]] (1832\u20131919) and evolutionary biologist [[Alfred Russel Wallace#Spiritualism|Alfred Russel Wallace]] (1823\u20131913).<ref>[[Ruth Brandon|Brandon, Ruth]].

However, the religion and its beliefs continue in spite of this, with physical mediumship and seances falling out of practice and platform mediumship coming to the fore.\n\nIn the late 1920s and early 1930s there were around one quarter of a million practising Spiritualists and some two thousand Spiritualist societies in the UK in addition to flourishing microcultures of platform mediumship and 'home circles'.<ref>Sutcliffe, Steven J. (2002). Children of the New Age. p. 35.</ref> Spiritualism continues to be practised, primarily through various denominational Spiritualist churches in the United States, Canada, Australia and the United Kingdom. In the United Kingdom, over 340 Spiritualist churches and centres open their doors to the public and free demonstrations of mediumship are regularly performed.<ref>[http://www.snu.org.uk/snu/about.html \"The SNU\"].</ref>\n\n== Terminology ==\n\n=== Spirit guide ===\n{{Main|Spirit guide}}\nIn 1958, the [[England|English]]-born Spiritualist C. Dorreen Phillips wrote of her experiences with a medium at [[Camp Chesterfield]], [[Indiana]]: \"In Rev. James Laughton's s\u00e9ances there are many [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Indians]]. They are very noisy and appear to have great power. [...] The little guides, or doorkeepers, are usually Indian boys and girls [who act] as messengers who help to locate the spirit friends who wish to speak with you.\"<ref name=\"Phillips\">''The Autobiography of a Fortune Teller'' by C. Doreen Phillips, Vantage Press, 1958.</ref>\n\n=== Spirit operator ===\nA spirit who uses a medium to manipulate psychic \"energy\" or \"energy systems.\"\n\n=== Demonstrations of mediumship ===\n[[File:Colin Evans fraud in 1938.jpg|thumb|right|[[Colin Evans (medium)|Colin Evans]], who claimed spirits lifted him into the air, was exposed as a fraud.]]\nIn old-line Spiritualism, a portion of the services, generally toward the end, is given over to demonstrations of mediumship through contact with the spirits of the dead. A typical example of this way of describing a mediumistic church service is found in the 1958 autobiography of C. Dorreen Phillips. She writes of the worship services at the Spiritualist [[Camp Chesterfield]] in [[Chesterfield, Indiana]]: \"Services are held each afternoon, consisting of hymns, a lecture on philosophy, and demonstrations of mediumship.\"<ref name=\"Phillips\" />\n\nToday \"demonstration of mediumship\" is part of the church service at all churches affiliated with the [[National Spiritualist Association of Churches]] (NSAC) and the [[Spiritualists' National Union]] (SNU). Demonstration links to NSAC's Declaration of Principal #9. \"We affirm that the precepts of Prophecy and Healing are Divine attributes proven through Mediumship.\"\n\n=== Mental mediumship ===\n\"Mental mediumship\" is communication of spirits with a medium by [[telepathy]]. The medium mentally \"hears\" (clairaudience), \"sees\" (clairvoyance), and/or feels (clairsentience) messages from spirits. Directly or with the help of a spirit guide, the medium passes the information on to the message's recipient(s). When a medium is doing a \"reading\" for a particular person, that person is known as the \"sitter\".\n\n=== Trance mediumship ===\n\"Trance mediumship\" is often seen as a form of mental mediumship. Most trance mediums remain conscious during a communication period, wherein a spirit uses the medium's mind to communicate. The spirit or spirits using the medium's mind influences the mind with the thoughts being conveyed. The medium allows the [[Id, ego and super-ego|ego]] to step aside for the message to be delivered. At the same time, one has awareness of the thoughts coming through and may even influence the message with one's own bias. Such a trance is not to be confused with [[sleepwalking]], as the patterns are entirely different. Castillo (1995) states,\n{{quote|Trance phenomena result from the behavior of intense focusing of attention, which is the key psychological mechanism of trance induction. Adaptive responses, including institutionalized forms of trance, are 'tuned' into neural networks in the brain.<ref>Richard Castillo (1995) ''Culture, Trance, and the Mind-Brain''. Anthropology of Consciousness. Volume 6, Issue 1, pp. 17\u201334, March 1995.</ref>}}\n\nIn the 1860s and 1870s, trance mediums were very popular. Spiritualism generally attracted female adherents, many who had strong interests in social justice. Many trance mediums delivered passionate speeches on [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionism]], [[temperance movement|temperance]], and [[women's suffrage]].<ref>Braude, Anne, ''Radical Spirits, Spiritualism and Women's Rights in Nineteenth Century America''. Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 2001.</ref> Scholars have described [[Leonora Piper]] as one of the most famous trance mediums in the history of Spiritualism.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/><ref>Deborah Blum. (2006). ''Ghost Hunters, William James and the Search for Scientific Proof of Life After Death''. The Penguin Press.</ref><ref>[[Amy Tanner]]. (1994, originally published 1910). ''Studies in Spiritism''. With an introduction by [[G. Stanley Hall]]. Prometheus Press. p. 18</ref>\n\nIn the typical deep trance, the medium may not have clear recall of all the messages conveyed while in an altered state; such people generally work with an assistant. That person selectively wrote down or otherwise recorded the medium's words.  Rarely did the assistant record the responding words of the sitter and other attendants. An example of this kind of relationship can be found in the early 20th century collaboration between the trance medium Mrs. Cecil M. Cook of the [[William T. Stead]] Memorial Center in Chicago (a religious body incorporated under the statutes of the State of Illinois) and the journalist [[Lloyd Kenyon Jones]]. The latter was a non-medium Spiritualist who transcribed Cook's messages in [[shorthand]]. He [[edited]] them for publication in book and pamphlet form.<ref>''God's World: A Treatise on Spiritualism Founded on Transcripts of Shorthand Notes Taken Down, Over a Period of Five Years, in the Seance-Room of the William T. Stead Memorial Center (a Religious Body Incorporated Under the Statutes of the State of Illinois), Mrs. Cecil M. Cook, Medium and Pastor. Compiled and Written by Lloyd Kenyon Jones.

Stead Memorial Center, 1919.</ref>\n\n=== Physical mediumship ===\n[[File:Seance Doll.jpg|thumb|left|A photograph of the medium [[Linda Gazzera]] with a doll as fake ectoplasm.]]\nPhysical mediumship is defined as manipulation of energies and energy systems by spirits. This type of mediumship is claimed to involve perceptible manifestations, such as loud raps and noises, voices, materialized objects, apports, materialized spirit bodies, or body parts such as hands, legs and feet. The medium is used as a source of power for such spirit manifestations. By some accounts, this was achieved by using the energy or ectoplasm released by a medium, see [[spirit photography]].<ref>[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/ectoplasm \"Ectoplasm\" def. Merriam Webster dictionary], Retrieved 18 January 2007</ref><ref>Somerlott, Robert, ''Here, Mr. Splitfoot''. Viking, 1971.</ref> The last physical medium to be tested by a committee from ''[[Scientific American]]'' was [[Mina Crandon]] in 1924.\n\nMost physical mediumship is presented in a darkened or dimly lit room. Most physical mediums make use of a traditional array of tools and appurtenances, including spirit trumpets, spirit cabinets, and levitation tables.\n{{clear}}\n\n=== Direct voice ===\nDirect voice communication is the claim that spirits speak independently of the medium, who facilitates the phenomenon rather than produces it. The role of the medium is to make the connection between the physical and spirit worlds. Trumpets are often utilised to amplify the signal, and directed voice mediums are sometimes known as \"trumpet mediums\". This form of mediumship also permits the medium to participate in the discourse during s\u00e9ances, since the medium's voice is not required by the spirit to communicate. [[Leslie Flint]] was one of the best known exponents of this form of mediumship.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Connor |first=Steven |year=1999 |chapter=9.

A medium is said to have psychic abilities but not all psychics function as mediums. The term ''clairvoyance'', for instance, may include seeing spirit and visions instilled by the spirit world.  The Parapsychological Association defines \"clairvoyance\" as information derived directly from an external physical source.<ref>[http://parapsych.org/glossary_a_d.html#c \"Glossary of Key Words Frequently Used in Parapsychology\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101120215806/http://www.parapsych.org/glossary_a_d.html |date=2010-11-20 }}, Parapsychological Association website, Retrieved January 29, 2007</ref>\n* [[Clairvoyance]] or \"clear seeing\", is the ability to see anything that is not physically present, such as objects, animals or people. This sight occurs \"in the mind's eye\".  Some mediums say that this is their normal vision state. Others say that they must train their minds with such practices as meditation in order to achieve this ability, and that assistance from spiritual helpers is often necessary. Some clairvoyant mediums can see a spirit as though the spirit has a physical body. They see the bodily form as if it were physically present. Other mediums see the spirit in their mind's eye, or it appears as a movie or a television programme or a still picture like a photograph in their mind.\n* [[Clairaudience]] or \"clear hearing\", is usually defined as the ability to hear the voices or thoughts of spirits. Some mediums hear as though they are listening to a person talking to them on the outside of their head, as though the Spirit is next to or near to the medium, and other mediums hear the voices in their minds as a verbal thought.\n* [[Clairsentience]] or \"clear sensing\", is the ability to have an impression of what a spirit wants to communicate, or to feel sensations instilled by a spirit.\n* [[Clairvoyance|Clairsentinence]] or \"clear feeling\" is a condition in which the medium takes on the ailments of a spirit, feeling the same physical problem which the spirit person had before death.\n* [[Clairalience]] or \"clear smelling\" is the ability to smell a spirit. For example, a medium may smell the pipe tobacco of a person who smoked during life.\n* [[Clairgustance]] or \"clear tasting\" is the ability to receive taste impressions from a spirit.\n* [[Claircognizance]] or \"clear knowing\", is the ability to know something without receiving it through normal or psychic senses.  It is a feeling of \"just knowing\".  Often, a medium will claim to have the feeling that a message or situation is \"right\" or \"wrong.\"\n\n== Explanations ==\n=== Paranormal belief ===\nSpiritualists believe that phenomena produced by mediums (both mental and physical mediumship) are the result of external [[spirit]] agencies.<ref>Ilya Vinitsky.

She concluded that the details about their lives mentioned by John were easily found on social media sources, and likely fed to John, making the readings actually [[hot reading]]s.

Specification for pyrotechnic calcium silicide is MIL-C-324C. In some mixtures it may be substituted with [[ferrosilicon]]. Silicon-based fuels are used in some time delay mixtures, e.g. for controlling of [[Pyrotechnic fastener|explosive bolts]], hand grenades, and infrared decoys.{{citation needed | date = May 2009}} Smoke compositions often contain [[hexachloroethane]]; during burning they produce [[silicon tetrachloride]], which, like [[titanium tetrachloride]] used in [[smoke-screen]]s, reacts with air moisture and produces dense white fog. [[Gum arabic]] is used in some mixtures to inhibit calcium silicide decomposition.\n\n===Heating food===\n[[Self-heating can]]s of military food rations developed during World War II used a [[thermite]]-like mixture of 1:1 [[iron(II,III) oxide]] and calcium silicide. Such mixture, when ignited, generates moderate amount of heat and no gaseous products.<ref>Calvert, J. B.
