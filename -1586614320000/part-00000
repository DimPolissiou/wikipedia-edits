This time they seemed to be a better outfit as they were to play in conditions that should have suited them the most. But they had to suffer an unfortunate start to the competition, with a narrow 4 run defeat to the Mumbai Indians at the Brabourne Stadium in Mumbai. The highlight of this match though, was Yusuf Pathan hitting the fastest ever hundred in IPL history, off only 37 balls! Even some of the Mumbai fans were disappointed not to see Rajasthan win, by the end of it all.<ref name=\"Rajasthan Royals\"/>\n\nThey went on to lose to the Delhi Daredevils by 6 wickets in one of their new \u2018home\u2019 grounds, Ahmedabad. And were again bruised badly by the Royal Challengers Bangalore, who won by 10 wickets. The team remained inconsistent throughout the whole season, winning their next four matches consecutively. One of the young Turks of the erstwhile ICL, Abhishek Jhunjhunwala impressed against the franchise representing his home state, Kolkata Knight Riders as his 36-ball 45 helped the Royals win by 34 runs.\n\nFollowed by which the Western Australian batsman Adam Voges hit 45 runs off 24 balls to help Rajasthan beat Punjab in Mohali by 31 runs. The team seemed to have adapted to the Ahmedabad conditions better with wins against Deccan Chargers by 8 wickets as Yusuf Pathan continued his good form against the team, while they beat Chennai Super Kings by 17 runs courtesy wicket-keeper batsman Naman Ojha's 49-ball 80.\n\nBut they lost against Chennai in their return clash as Murali Vijay's hundred took the game away from them as well as were crushed in Delhi by 67 runs. But they managed to escape a Deccan Chargers attack, with a narrow 2 run victory in Nagpur and continued their unbeaten run in Jaipur though, as the out of sorts Kings XI Punjab were duly beaten by 9 wickets with English opener Michael Lumb winning the man of the match award for his 43-ball 83.\n\nOnce again, Rajasthan Royals ended the tournament miserably with losses to Mumbai Indians and the Royal Challengers Bangalore at home and the Kolkata Knight Riders in the last round-robin game in Kolkata. Consequently, they failed to make it to the playoffs for the second consecutive season as they finished 7th out of the 8 teams in the competition, winning 6 games out of 14 played.<ref name=\"Rajasthan Royals\"/>\n\n===2011 IPL season===\n\nThe Rajasthan Royals, and the [[Kings XI Punjab]] were temporarily ejected from the league due to issues with their unreported ownership changes.

Yet, he decided to make this his final season for the Rajasthan Royals on the insistence of the team owners who felt that he was the ultimate source of inspiration for the team on and off the field.\n\nIn the auction, the team's funds were reduced since they were penalised by the BCCI in 2010 and as a result, had to pay a certain amount of bank guarantee as fixed by the High Court. But they possessed an adequate amount of money to buy some of the world's finest T20 players, which they did not exactly.\n\nThey managed to buy back Australian fast bowler [[Shaun Tait]] for US$300,000 as well as South African bowling all-rounder Johan Botha for US$950,000. The other star players which they picked were New Zealand batsman Ross Taylor for US$1&nbsp; million as well as \u2018The Wall\u2019 [[Rahul Dravid]] for half that price. England's World T20 2010 winning skipper [[Paul Collingwood]] was also purchased for a mere US$250,000. The other players were mostly from the domestic circuits but were confident individuals following Rajasthan winning the [[Ranji Trophy]] that year.\n\nRajasthan Royals began the IPL 2011 in grand fashion, beating the Kumar Sangakkara-led Deccan Chargers by 8 wickets, with the young Indian pacer Siddharth Trivedi adjudged the man of the match for his spell of 3/15 and the Royals continued their fine record against the Chargers. While Shane Warne defied age with a fine piece of bowling to assist Rajasthan in defeating a weakened Delhi Daredevils side by 6 wickets, with figures of 2/17.\n\nHowever, their confidence was dented with two back-to-back defeats to the new-look Kolkata Knight Riders in three days. In the clash at Jaipur, they lost by 9 wickets courtesy a 100-run partnership between Gautam Gambhir and Jacques Kallis, Whereas, in Kolkata, Lakshmipathy Balaji picked 3/15 in 4 overs on a minefield pitch in Eden Gardens to help his team pull off an 8 wicket victory.\n\nThe match against the Royal Challengers Bangalore in Bangalore was washed out due to rain, which made Rajasthan's task of making it into the last four much tougher. Shaun Marsh was in great nick and his 42-ball 71 resulted in the Royals losing to Kings XI Punjab in Mohali by 48 runs. However, they pulled together a string of a hat-trick of home wins, as Rajasthan chased successfully in all the three matches. The first was against the Kochi Tuskers Kerala, winning by 8 wickets. Followed by Mumbai Indians, the No.1 team then on the points table as they chased down a total of 100 with 7 wickets to spare. And then the Pune Warriors India were undone by Ross Taylors\u2019 35-ball 47 not out, as Rajasthan won by 6 wickets.\n\nBut again it was inconsistency which let the Royals down badly. They were given a proper thumping by the eventual champions Chennai Super Kings in both the matches they played against each other, within five days. The in-form Royal Challengers Bangalore thrashed them by 9 wickets courtesy Chris Gayle while they were bowled out for 97 in their 8-wicket defeat to the Kochi Tuskers Kerala.\n\nAlthough this time they ended their round-robin matches well with a win against the Mumbai Indians in Mumbai and in the process, giving Shane Warne a fitting farewell, Rajasthan were dismissed from the competition since they ended at the 6th position out of the 10 teams in the tournament, having again won 6 out of their 14 matches played, with one being a no result.<ref name=\"Rajasthan Royals\" />\n\n===2012 IPL season===\n\nRajasthan Royals finished in seventh place among the point table in season 5 of IPL winning only seven matches out of sixteen.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/indian-premier-league-2012/engine/series/520932.html?view=pointstable | title=Point table-2012 | publisher=ESPN cricinfo | accessdate=25 May 2013}}</ref>\n\n===2013 IPL season===\n\nRajasthan Royals qualified for the playoff stage by finishing third in the group stage, thus grabbing a spot in Champions League 2013.

The Royals are famous for their frugal spending in the IPL auctions, even during the mega-auctions held once in 3 years. They have even bought players who had previously never played first-class cricket such as [[Dinesh Salunkhe]] and [[Pravin Tambe]]. The team has also purchased leading cricketers at various times in their history like [[Shane Warne]], [[Graeme Smith]], [[Rahul Dravid]], [[Shanthakumaran Sreesanth]], [[Munaf Patel]], [[Mohammad Kaif]], [[Shaun Tait]], [[Ross Taylor]], [[Justin Langer]], [[Damien Martyn]], and [[Brad Hogg]] to name a few.\n\nMany of the cricketers who have played for the Royals, having been bought by them as relatively unknown players, have ended up as leading international cricketers partly due to their strong performances in the IPL and backing from the Royals management. In the initial seasons, such players included [[Taruwar Kohli]], who was acquired by the franchise in 2008 under the Under-19 player quota and [[Yusuf Pathan]], the elder brother of the Indian all-rounder [[Irfan Pathan]] and a relative unknown in cricketing circles unlike his more-celebrated younger brother. Yusuf's brilliant performances in the initial seasons of the IPL earned him a place in the Indian cricket team and he was a [[India at the Cricket World Cup#India at the 2011 World Cup|member of the Indian squad which won the 2011 Cricket World Cup]]. Even Australian [[Shane Watson]], who has played for the Royals ever since its inception, became a permanent, consistent and leading member of the [[Australia national cricket team|Australian cricket team]] soon after his brilliant first season with the Royals in 2008. In the later seasons, these players have included Indian cricketers such as [[Ajinkya Rahane]], wicket keeper-batsman [[Sanju Samson]], leg-spinner Tambe, whose performances for the Royals earned him a [[Ranji Trophy]] debut for [[Mumbai cricket team|Mumbai]] at the age of 42,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://sports.ndtv.com/|title=Latest Sports News, Live Scores, Results Today's Sports Headlines Updates - NDTV Sports|last=NDTVSports.com|website=NDTVSports.com|language=en|access-date=18 April 2019}}</ref> [[Stuart Binny]] and [[Dhawal Kulkarni]], as well as international cricketers like [[James Faulkner (cricketer)|James Faulkner]], [[Steve Smith (cricketer)|Steve Smith]] and [[Tim Southee]].

This time they seemed to be a better outfit as they were to play in conditions that should have suited them the most. But they had to suffer an unfortunate start to the competition, with a narrow 4 run defeat to the Mumbai Indians at the Brabourne Stadium in Mumbai. The highlight of this match though, was Yusuf Pathan hitting the fastest ever hundred in IPL history, off only 37 balls! Even some of the Mumbai fans were disappointed not to see Rajasthan win, by the end of it all.<ref name=\"Rajasthan Royals\"/>\n\nThey went on to lose to the Delhi Daredevils by 6 wickets in one of their new \u2018home\u2019 grounds, Ahmedabad. And were again bruised badly by the Royal Challengers Bangalore, who won by 10 wickets. The team remained inconsistent throughout the whole season, winning their next four matches consecutively. One of the young Turks of the erstwhile ICL, Abhishek Jhunjhunwala impressed against the franchise representing his home state, Kolkata Knight Riders as his 36-ball 45 helped the Royals win by 34 runs.\n\nFollowed by which the Western Australian batsman Adam Voges hit 45 runs off 24 balls to help Rajasthan beat Punjab in Mohali by 31 runs. The team seemed to have adapted to the Ahmedabad conditions better with wins against Deccan Chargers by 8 wickets as Yusuf Pathan continued his good form against the team, while they beat Chennai Super Kings by 17 runs courtesy wicket-keeper batsman Naman Ojha's 49-ball 80.\n\nBut they lost against Chennai in their return clash as Murali Vijay's hundred took the game away from them as well as were crushed in Delhi by 67 runs. But they managed to escape a Deccan Chargers attack, with a narrow 2 run victory in Nagpur and continued their unbeaten run in Jaipur though, as the out of sorts Kings XI Punjab were duly beaten by 9 wickets with English opener Michael Lumb winning the man of the match award for his 43-ball 83.\n\nOnce again, Rajasthan Royals ended the tournament miserably with losses to Mumbai Indians and the Royal Challengers Bangalore at home and the Kolkata Knight Riders in the last round-robin game in Kolkata. Consequently, they failed to make it to the playoffs for the second consecutive season as they finished 7th out of the 8 teams in the competition, winning 6 games out of 14 played.<ref name=\"Rajasthan Royals\"/>\n\n===2011 IPL season===\n\nThe Rajasthan Royals, and the [[Kings XI Punjab]] were temporarily ejected from the league due to issues with their unreported ownership changes.

Yet, he decided to make this his final season for the Rajasthan Royals on the insistence of the team owners who felt that he was the ultimate source of inspiration for the team on and off the field.\n\nIn the auction, the team's funds were reduced since they were penalised by the BCCI in 2010 and as a result, had to pay a certain amount of bank guarantee as fixed by the High Court. But they possessed an adequate amount of money to buy some of the world's finest T20 players, which they did not exactly.\n\nThey managed to buy back Australian fast bowler [[Shaun Tait]] for US$300,000 as well as South African bowling all-rounder Johan Botha for US$950,000. The other star players which they picked were New Zealand batsman Ross Taylor for US$1&nbsp; million as well as \u2018The Wall\u2019 [[Rahul Dravid]] for half that price. England's World T20 2010 winning skipper [[Paul Collingwood]] was also purchased for a mere US$250,000. The other players were mostly from the domestic circuits but were confident individuals following Rajasthan winning the [[Ranji Trophy]] that year.\n\nRajasthan Royals began the IPL 2011 in grand fashion, beating the Kumar Sangakkara-led Deccan Chargers by 8 wickets, with the young Indian pacer Siddharth Trivedi adjudged the man of the match for his spell of 3/15 and the Royals continued their fine record against the Chargers. While Shane Warne defied age with a fine piece of bowling to assist Rajasthan in defeating a weakened Delhi Daredevils side by 6 wickets, with figures of 2/17.\n\nHowever, their confidence was dented with two back-to-back defeats to the new-look Kolkata Knight Riders in three days. In the clash at Jaipur, they lost by 9 wickets courtesy a 100-run partnership between Gautam Gambhir and Jacques Kallis, Whereas, in Kolkata, Lakshmipathy Balaji picked 3/15 in 4 overs on a minefield pitch in Eden Gardens to help his team pull off an 8 wicket victory.\n\nThe match against the Royal Challengers Bangalore in Bangalore was washed out due to rain, which made Rajasthan's task of making it into the last four much tougher. Shaun Marsh was in great nick and his 42-ball 71 resulted in the Royals losing to Kings XI Punjab in Mohali by 48 runs. However, they pulled together a string of a hat-trick of home wins, as Rajasthan chased successfully in all the three matches. The first was against the Kochi Tuskers Kerala, winning by 8 wickets. Followed by Mumbai Indians, the No.1 team then on the points table as they chased down a total of 100 with 7 wickets to spare. And then the Pune Warriors India were undone by Ross Taylors\u2019 35-ball 47 not out, as Rajasthan won by 6 wickets.\n\nBut again it was inconsistency which let the Royals down badly. They were given a proper thumping by the eventual champions Chennai Super Kings in both the matches they played against each other, within five days. The in-form Royal Challengers Bangalore thrashed them by 9 wickets courtesy Chris Gayle while they were bowled out for 97 in their 8-wicket defeat to the Kochi Tuskers Kerala.\n\nAlthough this time they ended their round-robin matches well with a win against the Mumbai Indians in Mumbai and in the process, giving Shane Warne a fitting farewell, Rajasthan were dismissed from the competition since they ended at the 6th position out of the 10 teams in the tournament, having again won 6 out of their 14 matches played, with one being a no result.<ref name=\"Rajasthan Royals\" />\n\n===2012 IPL season===\n\nRajasthan Royals finished in seventh place among the point table in season 5 of IPL winning only seven matches out of sixteen.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/indian-premier-league-2012/engine/series/520932.html?view=pointstable | title=Point table-2012 | publisher=ESPN cricinfo | accessdate=25 May 2013}}</ref>\n\n===2013 IPL season===\n\nRajasthan Royals qualified for the playoff stage by finishing third in the group stage, thus grabbing a spot in Champions League 2013.

The Royals are famous for their frugal spending in the IPL auctions, even during the mega-auctions held once in 3 years. They have even bought players who had previously never played first-class cricket such as [[Dinesh Salunkhe]] and [[Pravin Tambe]]. The team has also purchased leading cricketers at various times in their history like [[Shane Warne]], [[Graeme Smith]], [[Rahul Dravid]], [[Shanthakumaran Sreesanth]], [[Munaf Patel]], [[Mohammad Kaif]], [[Shaun Tait]], [[Ross Taylor]], [[Justin Langer]], [[Damien Martyn]], and [[Brad Hogg]] to name a few.\n\nMany of the cricketers who have played for the Royals, having been bought by them as relatively unknown players, have ended up as leading international cricketers partly due to their strong performances in the IPL and backing from the Royals management.

{"title_page": "Flute Sonata (Poulenc)", "text_new": "The '''''Sonate pour fl\u00fbte et piano''''' ('''Flute Sonata'''), [[FP (Poulenc)|FP]] 164, by [[Francis Poulenc]], is a three-movement work for [[flute]] and [[piano]],  written in 1957. \n\nThe sonata was commissioned by the American [[Library of Congress]] and is dedicated to the memory of [[Elizabeth Sprague Coolidge]], an American patron of chamber music. Poulenc preferred composing for woodwinds above strings. He premiered the piece with the flautist [[Jean-Pierre Rampal]] in June 1957 at the [[Strasbourg Music Festival]]. The work was an immediate success, and was quickly taken up in the US, Britain and elsewhere and has been recorded many times. Critics have noted Poulenc's characteristic \"trademark bittersweet grace, wit, irony and sentiment\" in the piece. In 1976, thirteen years after Poulenc's death, the composer [[Lennox Berkeley]] made a well-regarded orchestrated version of the work that has also been recorded.\n\nThe flute sonata became one of Poulenc's best-known works and is a prominent feature in 20th-century flute repertoire. It has a claim to be the most played of any work for flute and piano.\n\n==Background and first performance==\nPoulenc began to think of writing a flute sonata in 1952, but he was occupied with his Sonata for Two Pianos and then his opera, ''[[Dialogues of the Carmelites|Dialogues des Carm\u00e9lites]]''.<ref name=nimbus>Clements, Dominy (2015). Notes to Nimbus CD NI 5933</ref> In April 1956, when he was still working on the opera, he was approached by [[Harold Spivacke]] of the American [[Library of Congress]] with a request to write a piece for two pianos or alternatively a chamber piece for up to six instruments.<ref>Schmidt (2001), p. 408</ref> Poulenc was too busy to accept, but Spivacke persisted. Poulenc told him, \"Much more at home with wind instruments than strings, I admit I am tempted by this combination\", as he had always preferred winds \u2013 with their similarities to the human voice \u2013 to stringed instruments.{{refn|Poulenc wrote: \"nothing could be further from human breath than the stroke of a bow\". He thought little of his own sonatas for cello and for violin.<ref>Mellers, pp. 160\u2013161</ref>|group=n}} In August he agreed to go ahead.<ref name=ib>Battioni, Isabelle (2000). Notes to Naxos CD 8.553611</ref> The sonata was commissioned in memory of a musical benefactor, [[Elizabeth Sprague Coolidge]], to whom Poulenc dedicated the work.<ref name=nimbus/> \n\nPoulenc spent the winter of 1956\u201357 in [[Cannes]], where he composed the sonata between December and March.<ref name=mm> MacDonald, Malcolm (2013). Notes to Opus Arte CD OACD9012D</ref> When he had completed the first two of the three movements, he wrote to his friend [[Pierre Bernac]]:\n{{blockindent|In working on this Flute Sonata I have the feeling of going back a long way, but with a more settled technique. It's a sonata of [[Claude Debussy|Debussyan]] dimensions. It's the French sense of balance [''la mesure fran\u00e7aise'']. Finding the form for your language is the most difficult thing. It's what [[Anton Webern|Webern]] has in the highest degree \u2026 and what [[Pierre Boulez|Boulez]] has not yet found.<ref>Nichols, p. 251</ref>|}}\n\nOn 18 June 1957, the public premiere was given at the [[Strasbourg Music Festival]] by the flautist [[Jean-Pierre Rampal]], for whom it had been written, with the composer at the piano.<ref name=hype>Mawer, Deborah (2001). Notes to Hyperion CD CDH55386</ref>{{refn|Rampal and Poulenc had given gave the work a private performance the previous day to an audience of one: the pianist [[Arthur Rubinstein]], who could not be present at the official premiere.<ref name=mm/>|group=n}} ''[[Le Figaro]]'' said of the work, \"The music burst forth from the heart, without formality, and 'sang', in every sense\". Another critic stated that the sonata was \"the best of Poulenc, and even a little better\".<ref name=js>Siegel, Joseph (2000). Notes to 4Tay CD 4019</ref>\n\n==Music==\nThe sonata is in three movements, taking a total of 12 minutes in performance.<ref>Poulenc, p. 1</ref> The score was published in France and Britain shortly after the premiere. In 1994 a new edition by Carl B. Schmidt and Patricia Harper was issued, correcting discrepancies and errors in the earlier published score.<ref name=js/> The musicologist [[Malcolm MacDonald (music critic)|Malcolm MacDonald]] writes of the sonata:\n\n{{block indent|The work is infused with Poulenc\u2019s trademark bittersweet grace, wit, irony and sentiment, which are manifested in different ways in each of its three movements. The first \u2026 makes clear the composer\u2019s elegiac intentions; the second is a haunting cantilena for the flute. Very fast and very tricky for the players, the skittish and vivacious \u2026 finale brings the work to a close in cheerful and sardonic style.<ref name=mm/>}}\n\n===''Allegretto malincolico''===\nThe movement starts in {{music|time|2|4}} (\u266a= 82) with an opening four-bar phrase with a descending theme, beginning with a broken [[Triad (music)|triad]] of [[Thirty-second note |demisemiquavers]] around high E and declining to the G above [[C (musical note)#Middle C |middle C]]. The piano's right-hand part interweaves [[arpeggio|arpeggiated]] [[sixteenth note|semiquavers]] over a [[pedal point|pedal]] in the left hand.<ref name=m156>Mellers, p. 156</ref> This is followed by an upward scale by both flute and piano leading to a contrasting theme, also descending.<ref>Rifkin,  pp. 141\u2013142</ref> MacDonald comments that the opening \"makes clear the composer\u2019s elegiac intentions\", and other analysts write of the \"poignancy\" of the principal theme, despite the seemingly vivacious tempo.<ref name=nimbus/><ref name=mm/><ref name=m163>Mellers, p. 163</ref> A counter-theme in F major gives the flute upwardly-leaping arpeggios, before the opening theme returns in A minor. [[Wilfrid Mellers]] comments that the reappearance of the first theme in an unexpected key makes it clear that Poulenc is not following [[sonata form]] but is using \"a subtle ternary structure\".<ref name=m163/> After a slightly faster middle section there is a recapitulation of a kind with, in Mellers's words, \"enharmonic ambiguities that justify the 'malinconico' of the directive\", and:\n\n{{blockindent|Fragments of the first section's airborne melody intermingle with ecstatic spurtings of the middle theme. A coda to the coda is explicitly based on [[blue note|blue]] false relations between major and minor thirds.<ref>Mellers, p. 164</ref>|}}\n\nThe flute part is technically demanding in this movement, with frequent trills and demisemiquaver tonguing.<ref name=hype/>\n\n===''Cantilena: Assez lent''===\nThis movement  (\u266a= 52) is much slower and quieter. In its song-like tune Poulenc acknowledged there were echoes of Sister Constance in ''Dialogues des Carm\u00e9lites'' but the effect here is purely lyrical \u2013 an \"infinite melody\" (''m\u00e9lodie infinie'') \u2013 with none of the drama of the opera.<ref>Car\u00e9, p. 45</ref> The movement begins with two [[quarter note|quavers]] on the piano, which are echoed by the flute during the course of the next two bars.<ref>Poulenc, p. 10</ref> The smooth [[Scale (music)|scalic]] lines of the opening section are succeeded by contrasting vigorous dotted rhythmic material in the middle section with the flute going up up a top B, before the tranquil opening theme returns to bring the movement to a close.<ref name=hype/>\n\nAsked about the term \"cantilena\", Poulenc replied that it \"is not a fixed form like passacaglia for example, it is a free form \u2026 I could have called it an interlude (\"interm\u00e8de\") or a romance\".<ref>Car\u00e9, p. 46</ref>\n\n===''Presto giocoso''===\nThis movement (\u2669=160\u2013168) is predominantly extrovert and fast; the beat is a strongly marked {{music|time|3|4}}. The shape is roughly that of a rondo with choruses and verses, but Poulenc treats the form freely. In Mellers's phrase, \"The flute flickers, the piano bounces, in a helter skelter gallop\".<ref>Mellers, pp. 164\u2013165</ref> The fast music culminates in a long trill on high G, followed by a brief silence from which there comes, unexpectedly, a quotation from the dotted rhythm \"''m\u00e9lancolique''\" theme of the first movement's middle section, in its original key of F sharp minor.<ref name=m165>Mellers, p. 165</ref> The music gathers speed again and the sonata sprints to a double fortissimo finish, \"strictement en mesure sans ralentir\" (\"strictly in time without any slowing down\").<ref>Poulenc, p. 23</ref>\n\nThe finale is sometimes compared to the exuberant finales of Poulenc's early chamber works, particularly the [[Trio for oboe, bassoon and piano|Trio]] (1926), but the Poulenc scholar Claude Car\u00e9 finds more in common between this movement and the ''[[Concert champ\u00eatre]]'' (1927\u201328).<ref>Car\u00e9, pp. 48\u201349</ref> The composer is reported to have said that the movement should be played as quickly as possible because \"it isn't any good\" (he probably would have liked more time to work on it)<ref name=nimbus/> but others have found it \"masterly\"<ref name=m165/> and \"a perfect conclusion\".<ref name=nimbus/>\n\n==Later concert performances and recordings==\nPoulenc considered giving the American premiere together with Rampal during a planned US tour, but the tour did not take place and Rampal gave the American premiere in February 1958 with his regular accompanist [[Robert Veyron-Lacroix]].<ref>Schmidt (2002), p. 464</ref> Poulenc was pleased to accompany other flautists in the sonata. In January 1959 he accompanied [[Gareth Morris]] in the British premiere, in an all-Poulenc programme that included the world premiere of his ''\u00c9l\u00e9gie in memory of Dennis Brain'' for horn and piano.<ref>\"[https://genome.ch.bbc.co.uk/page/1341c32439144c329b0ff1b9569f02d6?page=35 Third Programme]\", ''Radio Times'', 14 February 1959, p. 31</ref> Later in that year Poulenc played the piano part with [[Maxence Larrieu]] in [[Avignon]], Rampal in Paris and [[Christian Lard\u00e9]] in [[Menton]]. in 2015, the pianist and scholar [[David Owen Norris]] called the sonata \"probably the world's most played piece for flute and piano\".<ref name=bal>[https://www.bbc.co.uk/sounds/play/p0381qw0 \"Building a Library\"], BBC Radio 3, 14 November 2015.

The difficulty is the entirely pianistic nature of the accompaniment, extremely difficult to translate into orchestral terms. ... Another difficulty is that Francis, though there are things I love in his music, has passages that are strangely clumsy and that I long to rewrite, but of course I can't add or subtract anything and I should only spoil the whole thing \u2026 I have to think all the time of how he would have wanted it to sound.<ref name=lb>Berkeley, pp. 212\u2013213</ref>|}}\nThe musicologist [[Roger Covell]] wrote of Berkeley's orchestration, \"It is hard to imagine the job being done better \u2026 this sonata-concerto has Poulenc's characteristic and attractive mixture of flippancy and tenderness\".<ref>Covell, Roger. \"Classical\", ''The Sydney Morning Herald'', 12 May 1986, p. 56</ref> ''[[The Musical Times]]'' commented in 1978 that \"the orchestration does complete justice to the composer. [It] adds a worthwhile new dimension to the music: the long-drawn sad melodic lines played by the flute, especially in the first two movements, are complemented in a way not possible on the piano\".<ref>O'Loughlin, Niall.

Poulenc preferred composing for woodwinds above strings. He premiered the piece with the flautist [[Jean-Pierre Rampal]] in June 1957 at the [[Strasbourg Music Festival]]. The work was an immediate success, and was quickly taken up in the US, Britain and elsewhere and has been recorded many times. Critics have noted Poulenc's characteristic \"trademark bittersweet grace, wit, irony and sentiment\" in the piece. In 1976, thirteen years after Poulenc's death, the composer [[Lennox Berkeley]] made a well-regarded orchestrated version of the work that has also been recorded.\n\nThe flute sonata became one of Poulenc's best-known works and is a prominent feature in 20th-century flute repertoire. It has a claim to be the most played of any work for flute and piano.\n\n==Background and first performance==\nPoulenc began to think of writing a flute sonata in 1952, but he was occupied with his Sonata for Two Pianos and then his opera, ''[[Dialogues of the Carmelites|Dialogues des Carm\u00e9lites]]''.<ref name=nimbus>Clements, Dominy (2015). Notes to Nimbus CD NI 5933</ref> In April 1956, when he was still working on the opera, he was approached by [[Harold Spivacke]] of the American [[Library of Congress]] with a request to write a piece for two pianos or alternatively a chamber piece for up to six instruments.<ref>Schmidt (2001), p. 408</ref> Poulenc was too busy to accept, but Spivacke persisted. Poulenc told him, \"Much more at home with wind instruments than strings, I admit I am tempted by this combination\", as he had always preferred winds \u2013 with their similarities to the human voice \u2013 to stringed instruments.{{refn|Poulenc wrote: \"nothing could be further from human breath than the stroke of a bow\". He thought little of his own sonatas for cello and for violin.<ref>Mellers, pp. 160\u2013161</ref>|group=n}} In August he agreed to go ahead.<ref name=ib>Battioni, Isabelle (2000). Notes to Naxos CD 8.553611</ref> The sonata was commissioned in memory of a musical benefactor, [[Elizabeth Sprague Coolidge]], to whom Poulenc dedicated the work.<ref name=nimbus/> \n\nPoulenc spent the winter of 1956\u201357 in [[Cannes]], where he composed the sonata between December and March.<ref name=mm> MacDonald, Malcolm (2013). Notes to Opus Arte CD OACD9012D</ref> When he had completed the first two of the three movements, he wrote to his friend [[Pierre Bernac]]:\n{{blockindent|In working on this Flute Sonata I have the feeling of going back a long way, but with a more settled technique. It's a sonata of [[Claude Debussy|Debussyan]] dimensions. It's the French sense of balance [''la mesure fran\u00e7aise'']. Finding the form for your language is the most difficult thing. It's what [[Anton Webern|Webern]] has in the highest degree \u2026 and what [[Pierre Boulez|Boulez]] has not yet found.<ref>Nichols, p. 251</ref>|}}\n\nOn 18 June 1957, the public premiere was given at the [[Strasbourg Music Festival]] by the flautist [[Jean-Pierre Rampal]], for whom it had been written, with the composer at the piano.<ref name=hype>Mawer, Deborah (2001). Notes to Hyperion CD CDH55386</ref>{{refn|Rampal and Poulenc had given gave the work a private performance the previous day to an audience of one: the pianist [[Arthur Rubinstein]], who could not be present at the official premiere.<ref name=mm/>|group=n}} ''[[Le Figaro]]'' said of the work, \"The music burst forth from the heart, without formality, and 'sang', in every sense\". Another critic stated that the sonata was \"the best of Poulenc, and even a little better\".<ref name=js>Siegel, Joseph (2000). Notes to 4Tay CD 4019</ref>\n\n==Music==\nThe sonata is in three movements, taking a total of 12 minutes in performance.<ref>Poulenc, p. 1</ref> The score was published in France and Britain shortly after the premiere. In 1994 a new edition by Carl B. Schmidt and Patricia Harper was issued, correcting discrepancies and errors in the earlier published score.<ref name=js/> The musicologist [[Malcolm MacDonald (music critic)|Malcolm MacDonald]] writes of the sonata:\n\n{{block indent|The work is infused with Poulenc\u2019s trademark bittersweet grace, wit, irony and sentiment, which are manifested in different ways in each of its three movements. The first \u2026 makes clear the composer\u2019s elegiac intentions; the second is a haunting cantilena for the flute. Very fast and very tricky for the players, the skittish and vivacious \u2026 finale brings the work to a close in cheerful and sardonic style.<ref name=mm/>}}\n\n===''Allegretto malincolico''===\nThe movement starts in {{music|time|2|4}} (\u266a= 82) with an opening four-bar phrase with a descending theme, beginning with a broken [[Triad (music)|triad]] of [[Thirty-second note |demisemiquavers]] around high E and declining to the G above [[C (musical note)#Middle C |middle C]]. The piano's right hand part interweaves [[arpeggio|arpeggiated]] [[sixteenth note|semiquavers]] over a [[pedal point|pedal]] in the left hand.<ref name=m156>Mellers, p. 156</ref> This is followed by an upward scale by both flute and piano leading to a contrasting theme, also descending.<ref>Rifkin,  pp. 141\u2013142</ref> MacDonald comments that the opening \"makes clear the composer\u2019s elegiac intentions\", and other analysts write of the \"poignancy\" of the principal theme, despite the seemingly vivacious tempo.<ref name=nimbus/><ref name=mm/><ref name=m163>Mellers, p. 163</ref> A counter-theme in F major gives the flute upwardly-leaping arpeggios, before the opening theme returns in A minor. [[Wilfrid Mellers]] comments that the reappearance of the first theme in an unexpected key makes it clear that Poulenc is not following [[sonata form]] but is using \"a subtle ternary structure\".<ref name=m163/> After a slightly faster middle section there is a recapitulation of a kind with, in Mellers's words, \"enharmonic ambiguities that justify the 'malinconico' of the directive\", and:\n\n{{blockindent|Fragments of the first section's airborne melody intermingle with ecstatic spurtings of the middle theme. A coda to the coda is explicitly based on [[blue note|blue]] false relations between major and minor thirds.<ref>Mellers, p. 164</ref>|}}\n\nThe flute part is technically demanding in this movement, with frequent trills and demisemiquaver tonguing.<ref name=hype/>\n\n===''Cantilena: Assez lent''===\nThis movement  (\u266a= 52) is much slower and quieter. In its song-like tune Poulenc acknowledged there were echoes of Sister Constance in ''Dialogues des Carm\u00e9lites'' but the effect here is purely lyrical \u2013 an \"infinite melody\" (''m\u00e9lodie infinie'') \u2013 with none of the drama of the opera.<ref>Car\u00e9, p. 45</ref> The movement begins with two [[quarter note|quavers]] on the piano, which are echoed by the flute during the course of the next two bars.<ref>Poulenc, p. 10</ref> The smooth [[Scale (music)|scalic]] lines of the opening section are succeeded by contrasting vigorous dotted rhythmic material in the middle section with the flute going up up a top B, before the tranquil opening theme returns to bring the movement to a close.<ref name=hype/>\n\nAsked about the term \"cantilena\", Poulenc replied that it \"is not a fixed form like passacaglia for example, it is a free form \u2026 I could have called it an interlude (\"interm\u00e8de\") or a romance\".<ref>Car\u00e9, p. 46</ref>\n\n===''Presto giocoso''===\nThis movement (\u2669=160\u2013168) is predominantly extrovert and fast; the beat is a strongly marked {{music|time|3|4}}. The shape is roughly that of a rondo with choruses and verses, but Poulenc treats the form freely. In Mellers's phrase, \"The flute flickers, the piano bounces, in a helter skelter gallop\".<ref>Mellers, pp. 164\u2013165</ref> The fast music culminates in a long trill on high G, followed by a brief silence from which there comes, unexpectedly, a quotation from the dotted rhythm \"''m\u00e9lancolique''\" theme of the first movement's middle section, in its original key of F sharp minor.<ref name=m165>Mellers, p. 165</ref> The music gathers speed again and the sonata sprints to a double fortissimo finish, \"strictement en mesure sans ralentir\" (\"strictly in time without any slowing down\").<ref>Poulenc, p. 23</ref>\n\nThe finale is sometimes compared to the exuberant finales of Poulenc's early chamber works, particularly the [[Trio for oboe, bassoon and piano|Trio]] (1926), but the Poulenc scholar Claude Car\u00e9 finds more in common between this movement and the ''[[Concert champ\u00eatre]]'' (1927\u201328).<ref>Car\u00e9, pp. 48\u201349</ref> The composer is reported to have said that the movement should be played as quickly as possible because \"it isn't any good\" (he probably would have liked more time to work on it)<ref name=nimbus/> but others have found it \"masterly\"<ref name=m165/> and \"a perfect conclusion\".<ref name=nimbus/>\n\n==Later concert performances and recordings==\nPoulenc considered giving the American premiere together with Rampal during a planned US tour, but the tour did not take place and Rampal gave the American premiere in February 1958 with his regular accompanist [[Robert Veyron-Lacroix]].<ref>Schmidt (2002), p. 464</ref> Poulenc was pleased to accompany other flautists in the sonata. In January 1959 he accompanied [[Gareth Morris]] in the British premiere, in an all-Poulenc programme that included the world premiere of his ''\u00c9l\u00e9gie in memory of Dennis Brain'' for horn and piano.<ref>\"[https://genome.ch.bbc.co.uk/page/1341c32439144c329b0ff1b9569f02d6?page=35 Third Programme]\", ''Radio Times'', 14 February 1959, p. 31</ref> Later in that year Poulenc played the piano part with [[Maxence Larrieu]] in [[Avignon]], Rampal in Paris and [[Christian Lard\u00e9]] in [[Menton]]. in 2015, the pianist and scholar [[David Owen Norris]] called the sonata \"probably the world's most played piece for flute and piano\".<ref name=bal>[https://www.bbc.co.uk/sounds/play/p0381qw0 \"Building a Library\"], BBC Radio 3, 14 November 2015.

The difficulty is the entirely pianistic nature of the accompaniment, extremely difficult to translate into orchestral terms. ... Another difficulty is that Francis, though there are things I love in his music, has passages that are strangely clumsy and that I long to rewrite, but of course I can't add or subtract anything and I should only spoil the whole thing \u2026 I have to think all the time of how he would have wanted it to sound.<ref name=lb>Berkeley, pp. 212\u2013213</ref>|}}\nThe musicologist [[Roger Covell]] wrote of Berkeley's orchestration, \"It is hard to imagine the job being done better \u2026 this sonata-concerto has Poulenc's characteristic and attractive mixture of flippancy and tenderness\".<ref>Covell, Roger. \"Classical\", ''The Sydney Morning Herald'', 12 May 1986, p. 56</ref> ''[[The Musical Times]]'' commented in 1978 that \"the orchestration does complete justice to the composer. [It] adds a worthwhile new dimension to the music: the long-drawn sad melodic lines played by the flute, especially in the first two movements, are complemented in a way not possible on the piano\".<ref>O'Loughlin, Niall.

Some of these factors include virulence characteristics of the virus that is infecting. In order to cause disease, the virus must also overcome several inhibitory effects present in the host. Some of the inhibitory effects include distance, physical barriers and host defenses. These inhibitory effects may differ among individuals due to the inhibitory effects being genetically controlled.\n\nViral pathogenesis comprise of various factors: '''(1)''' transmission, entry and spread within the host, '''(2)''' [[tropism]], '''(3)''' virus virulence and disease mechanisms, '''(4)''' host factors and host defense.<ref name =\"sherris2014\">{{cite book |title =Sherris Medical Microbiology |chapter = Chapter 7 Viral Pathogenesis |edition =6 |editor1=Kenneth J Ryan |editor2=C George Ray |date =2014 }}</ref>\n\n\n==Mechanisms of infection==\nViruses need to establish infections in host cells in order to multiply. For infections to occur, the virus has to hijack host factors and evade the host immune response for safe replication. Viral replication frequently requires complex interactions between the virus and host factors that may result in deleterious effects in the host, which confers the virus its pathogenicity. \n\n===Important steps of a virus life cycle that shape pathogenesis:===\n[[File:Typical sites of virus entry into the body.png|thumb|300px|right|Typical sites of virus entry into the body: The first steps of viral infection is determined by the site at which the virus implants into the body.

Firstly, there must be sufficient quantity of virus available to initiate infection. Cells at the site of infection must be accessible, in that they possess host factors that the virus can exploit for entry into the cell, and the host anti-viral defense systems must be ineffective or absent.<ref name =\"raca\"/>\n\n===Implantation at point of entry===\nThe virus must implant at the entry portal of the body. Implantation is the earliest stage of pathogenesis. Implantation frequency is at its greatest where viruses directly contact living cells. Viruses usually implant on cells of respiratory, gastrointestinal, skin and genital tissues. Some viruses are capable of implanting in a fetus through infected germ cells at the time of [[fertilization]]. Implantation can also occur later in the pregnancy via the placenta, and also at birth.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n===Local replication and spread=== \nFollowing implantation, the virus hijacks the host cell machinery to undergo viral amplification. Here, the virus must modulate the host innate immune response to prevent its elimination by the body while facilitating its replication. Replicated virus from the initially infected cell then disperse to infect neighbouring susceptible cells, possibly with spread to different cell types like leukocytes. This results in a [[localized disease|localised infection]], in which the virus mainly spreads and infects adjacent cells to the site of entry. Otherwise, the virus can be released into extracellular fluids.\nExamples of localised infections include: common cold ([[rhinovirus]]), flu ([[Human parainfluenza viruses|parainfluenza]]), gastrointestinal infections ([[rotavirus]]) or skin infections ([[Human papillomavirus infection|papillomavirus]]) are examples of localised infections.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n===Dissemination and secondary replication=== \nIn other cases, the virus can cause [[systemic disease]] through a disseminated infection spread throughout the body. The predominant mode of viral dissemination occurs through the blood or [[lymphatic system]], some of which include viruses responsible for chickenpox ([[varicella zoster virus]]), smallpox ([[smallpox|variola]]), HIV ([[HIV|human immunodeficiency virus]]). A minority of viruses can disseminate via the nervous system.<ref name=\":0\" /> Notably, the [[poliovirus]] can be transmitted via the fecal-oral route, where it initially replicates in its site of entry, the small intestine and spread to regional [[lymph node]]s. Then, the virus disseminates via the bloodstream into different organs in the body (e.g. liver, spleen), followed by a secondary round of replication and dissemination into the central nervous system to damage [[motor neuron]]s.<ref name=\"sherris2014\" />\n\n===Shedding and secondary transmission=== \nFinally, the viruses spread to sites where [[Viral shedding|shedding]] into the environment can occur. The [[respiratory]], [[alimentary]] and [[urogenital]] tracts and the blood are the most frequent sites of shedding in the form of bodily fluids, aerosols, skin, excrement. The virus would then go on to be transmitted to another person, and establish the infection cycle all over again.<ref name=\"sherris2014\" />\n\n==Factors affecting pathogenesis== \nThere are a few main overarching factors affecting viral diseases:\n*Virus tropism\n*Virus factors\n*Host factors\n\n===Molecular basis of virus tropism===\n'''Virus tropism''' refers to the virus\u2019 preferential site of replication in discrete cell types within an organ. In most cases, tropism is determined by the ability of the [[viral protein|viral surface proteins]] to fuse or bind to surface receptors of specific target cells to establish infection.  Thus, the binding specificity of viral surface proteins dictates tropism as well as the destruction of particular cell populations, and is therefore a major determinant of virus pathogenesis.<ref name=\"patho\" />\nHowever, [[co-receptor]]s are sometimes required in addition to the binding of cellular receptors on host cells to viral proteins in order to establish infection. For instance, HIV-1 requires target cells to express co-receptors [[CCR5]] or [[CXCR4]], on top of the [[CD4]] receptor for productive viral attachment. Interestingly, HIV-1 can undergo a [[HIV tropism|tropism switch]], where the virus initially uses CCR5 as the primary co-receptor for entering the host cell. Subsequently, HIV-1 switches to bind to CXCR4 as the infection progresses, in doing so transitions the viral pathogenicity to a different stage.<ref>  {{Cite journal | author=Shen, H., Yin, J., Leng, F. | title=HIV coreceptor tropism determination and mutational pattern identification | journal=[[Scientific Reports]] | volume=6 | year=2016 | url=https://doi.org/10.1038/srep21280 }}  </ref> \n\nApart from cellular receptors, viral tropism can also governed by other intracellular factors, such as tissue-specific [[transcription factors]]. An example would be the [[JC polyomavirus]], in which its tropism is limited to [[glial cells]] since its [[enhancer]] is only active in glial cells.<ref name=\":0\" /> \n\nThe accessibility of host tissues and organs to the virus also regulates tropism. Accessibility is affected by physical barriers such as tissue barriers and the mucus layer.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n===Virus factors===\nViral genetics encoding viral factors will determine the degree of viral pathogenesis. This can be measured as [[virulence]] , which can be used to compare the quantitative degree of pathology between related viruses. In other words, different virus strains possessing different virus factors can lead to different degrees of virulence, which in turn can be exploited to study the differences in pathogenesis of viral variants with different virulence.<ref name=\"principlesvirology\"/>\n\nVirus factors are largely influenced by viral genetics, which is the virulence determinant of structural or non-structural proteins and [[non-coding DNA|non-coding sequences]]. For a virus to successfully infect and cause disease in the host, it has to encode specific virus factors in its genome to overcome the preventive effects of physical barriers, and modulate host inhibition of virus replication.<ref name=\"patho\" /> In the case of poliovirus, all vaccine strains found in the oral [[polio vaccine]] contain attenuating point mutations in the [[five prime untranslated region| 5' untranslated region]]. Conversely, the virulent strain responsible for causing smallpox does not contain these 5\u2019 UTR point mutations and thus display greater viral pathogenicity in hosts.<ref name=\"Nathanson\" />\n\nVirus factors encoded in the genome often control the tropism, routes of virus entry, shedding and transmission. In polioviruses, the attenuating point mutations are thought to induce a replication and [[translation]] defect to reduce the virus\u2019 ability of cross-linking to host cells and replicate within the nervous system.<ref> {{Cite journal | author=Guti\u00e9rrez AL | title=Attenuating Mutations in the Poliovirus 5\" Untranslated Region Alter Its Interaction with Polypyrimidine Tract-Binding Protein | journal=[[Journal of Virology]] | volume=71 | year=1997 | pages=3826\u20133833 | url=https://jvi.asm.org/content/jvi/71/5/3826.full.pdf }}  </ref>\n\nViruses have also developed a variety of [[immunomodulation]] mechanisms to subvert the host immune response. This tend to feature virus-encoded decoy receptors that target [[cytokine]]s and [[chemokine]]s produced as part of the host immune response, or homologues of host cytokines.<ref>  {{Cite journal | author=Felix, J., Savvides, S. | title=Mechanisms of immunomodulation by mammalian and viral decoy receptors: insights from structures | journal=[[Nature Reviews Immunology]] | volume=17 | year=2017 | pages=112-129 | url=https://doi.org/10.1038/nri.2016.134 }}  </ref> As such, viruses capable of manipulating the host cell response to infection as an immune evasion strategy exhibit greater pathogenicity.\n\n===Host factors=== \nViral pathogenesis is also largely dependent on host factors. Several viral infections have displayed a variety of effects, ranging from [[asymptomatic]] to symptomatic or even critical infection, solely based of differing host factors alone.  In particular, genetic factors, age and [[immunocompetence]] play an important role is dictating whether the viral infection can be modulated by the host.<ref name =\"modernvirology\">{{cite book |title =Introduction to modern virology |edition =7 |editor1=Nigel J.

Therefore, mice carrying a non-functional Mx [[allele]] fail to synthesise the Mx protein and are more susceptible to influenza infection.<ref>  {{Cite journal | author=Staeheli P, Grob R, Meier E, Sutcliffe JG, Haller O | title=Influenza virus-susceptible mice carry Mx genes with a large deletion or a nonsense mutation | journal=[[Molecular Cell Biology]] | volume=8 | year=1988 | doi=10.1128/mcb.8.10.4518 }}  </ref> Alternatively, [[immunocompromised]] individuals due to existing illnesses may have a defective immune system which makes them more vulnerable to damage by the virus. Furthermore, a number of viruses display variable pathogenicity depending on the age of the host. [[Mumps]], polio, and [[Epstein-Barr virus]] cause more severe disease in adults, while others like rotavirus cause more severe infection in infants. It is therefore hypothesized that the host immune system and defense mechanisms might differ with age.<ref name=\"principlesvirology\">{{cite book |title=Principles of Molecular Virology (Sixth Edition) |last=Cann |first=Alan |page=[https://doi.org/10.1016/B978-0-12-801946-7.00007-9] | year=2016 |publisher=[[Elsevier]] |isbn=9780128011744 |date=2016-01-04 |url-access=registration |url=https://doi.org/10.1016/B978-0-12-801946-7.00007-9 }}</ref>\n\n==Disease mechanisms: How do viral infections cause disease?==\nA viral infection does not always cause disease. A viral infection simply involves viral replication in the host, but [[disease]] is the damage caused by the viral multiplication. An individual who has a viral infection but does not display disease symptoms is known as a [[Asymptomatic carrier|carrier]]. \n\n===Damage caused by the virus===\nImportantly, viral infections can differ by the \u201clifestyle strategy\u201d \u2013 infections can either be [[lytic]] or [[Persistent infection|persistent]]. '''Lytic infections''' occur when viral replication produces factors that interfere with host cellular processes resulting in cell death. '''Persistent infections''' happen when cells continue to survive despite a viral infection and can be further classified into '''latent''' (only the viral [[genome]] is present, there is no replication occurring) and '''chronic''' (basal levels of viral replication without stimulating an immune response). In acute infections, lytic viruses are shed at high titres for rapid infection to a secondary tissue/host, whereas persistent viruses undergo shedding at lower titres for a longer duration of transmission (months to years).<ref name=\"Nathanson\" />\n\nLytic viruses are capable of destroying host cells by incurring and/or interfering with the specialised functions of host cells. An example would be the triggering of [[necrosis]] in host cells infected with the virus. Otherwise, signatures of viral infection, like the binding of HIV to co-receptors CCR5 or CXCR4, can also trigger cell death via [[apoptosis]] through host signalling cascades by immune cells.

Some of these factors include virulence characteristics of the virus that is infecting. In order to cause disease, the virus must also overpower several inhibitory effects present in the host. Some of the inhibitory effects include distance, physical barriers, host defenses, and conflicting cellular susceptibilities. These inhibitory effects may differ among individuals due to the inhibitory effects being genetically controlled.\n\nViral pathogenesis comprise of various factors: '''(1)''' transmission, entry and spread within the host, '''(2)''' [[tropism]], '''(3)''' virus virulence and disease mechanisms, '''(4)''' host factors and host defense.<ref name =\"sherris2014\">{{cite book |title =Sherris Medical Microbiology |chapter = Chapter 7 Viral Pathogenesis |edition =6 |editor1=Kenneth J Ryan |editor2=C George Ray |date =2014 }}</ref>\n\n\n==Mechanisms of infection==\nViruses need to establish infections in host cells in order to multiply. For infections to occur, the virus has to hijack host factors and evade the host immune response for safe replication. Viral replication frequently requires complex interactions between the virus and host factors that may result in deleterious effects in the host, which confers the virus its pathogenicity. \n\n===Important steps of a virus life cycle that shape pathogenesis:===\n[[File:Typical sites of virus entry into the body.png|thumb|300px|right|Typical sites of virus entry into the body: The first steps of viral infection is determined by the site at which the virus implants into the body.

Firstly, there must be sufficient quantity of virus available to initiate infection. Cells at the site of infection must be accessible, in that they possess host factors that the virus can exploit for entry into the cell, and the host anti-viral defense systems must be ineffective or absent.<ref name =\"raca\"/>\n\n===Implantation at point of entry===\nThe virus must implant at the entry portal of the body. Implantation is the earliest stage of pathogenesis. Implantation frequency is at its greatest where viruses directly contact living cells. Viruses usually implant on cells of respiratory, gastrointestinal, skin and genital tissues. Some viruses are capable of implanting in a fetus through infected germ cells at the time of [[fertilization]]. Implantation can also occur later in the pregnancy via the placenta, and also at birth.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n===Local replication and spread=== \nFollowing implantation, the virus hijacks the host cell machinery to undergo viral amplification. Here, the virus must modulate the host innate immune response to prevent its elimination by the body while facilitating its replication. Replicated virus from the initially infected cell then disperse to infect neighbouring susceptible cells, possibly with spread to different cell types like leukocytes. This results in a [[localized disease|localised infection]], in which the virus mainly spreads and infects adjacent cells to the site of entry. Otherwise, the virus can be released into extracellular fluids.\nExamples of localised infections include: common cold ([[rhinovirus]]), flu ([[Human parainfluenza viruses|parainfluenza]]), gastrointestinal infections ([[rotavirus]]) or skin infections ([[Human papillomavirus infection|papillomavirus]]) are examples of localised infections.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n===Dissemination and secondary replication=== \nIn other cases, the virus can cause [[systemic disease]] through a disseminated infection spread throughout the body. The predominant mode of viral dissemination occurs through the blood or [[lymphatic system]], some of which include viruses responsible for chickenpox ([[varicella zoster virus]]), smallpox ([[smallpox|variola]]), HIV ([[HIV|human immunodeficiency virus]]). A minority of viruses can disseminate via the nervous system.<ref name=\":0\" /> Notably, the [[poliovirus]] can be transmitted via the fecal-oral route, where it initially replicates in its site of entry, the small intestine and spread to regional [[lymph node]]s. Then, the virus disseminates via the bloodstream into different organs in the body (e.g. liver, spleen), followed by a secondary round of replication and dissemination into the central nervous system to damage [[motor neuron]]s.<ref name=\"sherris2014\" />\n\n===Shedding and secondary transmission=== \nFinally, the viruses spread to sites where [[Viral shedding|shedding]] into the environment can occur. The [[respiratory]], [[alimentary]] and [[urogenital]] tracts and the blood are the most frequent sites of shedding in the form of bodily fluids, aerosols, skin, excrement. The virus would then go on to be transmitted to another person, and establish the infection cycle all over again.<ref name=\"sherris2014\" />\n\n==Factors affecting pathogenesis== \nThere are a few main overarching factors affecting viral diseases:\n*Virus tropism\n*Virus factors\n*Host factors\n\n===Molecular basis of virus tropism===\n'''Virus tropism''' refers to the virus\u2019 preferential site of replication in discrete cell types within an organ. In most cases, tropism is determined by the ability of the [[viral protein|viral surface proteins]] to fuse or bind to surface receptors of specific target cells to establish infection.  Thus, the binding specificity of viral surface proteins dictates tropism as well as the destruction of particular cell populations, and is therefore a major determinant of virus pathogenesis.<ref name=\"patho\" />\nHowever, [[co-receptor]]s are sometimes required in addition to the binding of cellular receptors on host cells to viral proteins in order to establish infection. For instance, HIV-1 requires target cells to express co-receptors [[CCR5]] or [[CXCR4]], on top of the [[CD4]] receptor for productive viral attachment. Interestingly, HIV-1 can undergo a [[HIV tropism|tropism switch]], where the virus initially uses CCR5 as the primary co-receptor for entering the host cell. Subsequently, HIV-1 switches to bind to CXCR4 as the infection progresses, in doing so transitions the viral pathogenicity to a different stage.<ref>  {{Cite journal | author=Shen, H., Yin, J., Leng, F. | title=HIV coreceptor tropism determination and mutational pattern identification | journal=[[Scientific Reports]] | volume=6 | year=2016 | url=https://doi.org/10.1038/srep21280 }}  </ref> \n\nApart from cellular receptors, viral tropism can also governed by other intracellular factors, such as tissue-specific [[transcription factors]]. An example would be the [[JC polyomavirus]], in which its tropism is limited to [[glial cells]] since its [[enhancer]] is only active in glial cells.<ref name=\":0\" /> \n\nThe accessibility of host tissues and organs to the virus also regulates tropism. Accessibility is affected by physical barriers such as tissue barriers and the mucus layer.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n===Virus factors===\nViral genetics encoding viral factors will determine the degree of viral pathogenesis. This can be measured as [[virulence]] , which can be used to compare the quantitative degree of pathology between related viruses. In other words, different virus strains possessing different virus factors can lead to different degrees of virulence, which in turn can be exploited to study the differences in pathogenesis of viral variants with different virulence.<ref name=\"principlesvirology\"/>\n\nVirus factors are largely influenced by viral genetics, which is the virulence determinant of structural or non-structural proteins and [[non-coding DNA|non-coding sequences]]. For a virus to successfully infect and cause disease in the host, it has to encode specific virus factors in its genome to overcome the preventive effects of physical barriers, and modulate host inhibition of virus replication.<ref name=\"patho\" /> In the case of poliovirus, all vaccine strains found in the oral [[polio vaccine]] contain attenuating point mutations in the [[five prime untranslated region| 5' untranslated region]]. Conversely, the virulent strain responsible for causing smallpox does not contain these 5\u2019 UTR point mutations and thus display greater viral pathogenicity in hosts.<ref name=\"Nathanson\" />\n\nVirus factors encoded in the genome often control the tropism, routes of virus entry, shedding and transmission. In polioviruses, the attenuating point mutations are thought to induce a replication and [[translation]] defect to reduce the virus\u2019 ability of cross-linking to host cells and replicate within the nervous system.<ref> {{Cite journal | author=Guti\u00e9rrez AL | title=Attenuating Mutations in the Poliovirus 5\" Untranslated Region Alter Its Interaction with Polypyrimidine Tract-Binding Protein | journal=[[Journal of Virology]] | volume=71 | year=1997 | pages=3826\u20133833 | url=https://jvi.asm.org/content/jvi/71/5/3826.full.pdf }}  </ref>\n\nViruses have also developed a variety of [[immunomodulation]] mechanisms to subvert the host immune response. This tend to feature virus-encoded decoy receptors that target [[cytokine]]s and [[chemokine]]s produced as part of the host immune response, or homologues of host cytokines.<ref>  {{Cite journal | author=Felix, J., Savvides, S. | title=Mechanisms of immunomodulation by mammalian and viral decoy receptors: insights from structures | journal=[[Nature Reviews Immunology]] | volume=17 | year=2017 | pages=112-129 | url=https://doi.org/10.1038/nri.2016.134 }}  </ref> As such, viruses capable of manipulating the host cell response to infection as an immune evasion strategy exhibit greater pathogenicity.\n\n===Host factors=== \nViral pathogenesis is also largely dependent on host factors. Several viral infections have displayed a variety of effects, ranging from [[asymptomatic]] to symptomatic or even critical infection, solely based of differing host factors alone.  In particular, genetic factors, age and [[immunocompetence]] play an important role is dictating whether the viral infection can be modulated by the host.<ref name =\"modernvirology\">{{cite book |title =Introduction to modern virology |edition =7 |editor1=Nigel J.

Furthermore, a number of viruses display variable pathogenicity depending on the age of the host. [[Mumps]], polio, and [[Epstein-Barr virus]] cause more severe disease in adults, while others like rotavirus cause more severe infection in infants. It is therefore hypothesized that the host immune system and defense mechanisms might differ with age.<ref name=\"principlesvirology\">{{cite book |title=Principles of Molecular Virology (Sixth Edition) |last=Cann |first=Alan |page=[https://doi.org/10.1016/B978-0-12-801946-7.00007-9] | year=2016 |publisher=[[Elsevier]] |isbn=9780128011744 |date=2016-01-04 |url-access=registration |url=https://doi.org/10.1016/B978-0-12-801946-7.00007-9 }}</ref>\n\n==Disease mechanisms: How do viral infections cause disease?==\nA viral infection does not always cause disease. A viral infection simply involves viral replication in the host, but [[disease]] is the damage caused by the viral multiplication. An individual who has a viral infection but does not display disease symptoms is known as a [[Asymptomatic carrier|carrier]]. \n\n===Damage caused by the virus===\nImportantly, viral infections can differ by the \u201clifestyle strategy\u201d \u2013 infections can either be [[lytic]] or [[Persistent infection|persistent]]. '''Lytic infections''' occur when viral replication produces factors that interfere with host cellular processes resulting in cell death. '''Persistent infections''' happen when cells continue to survive despite a viral infection and can be further classified into '''latent''' (only the viral [[genome]] is present, there is no replication occurring) and '''chronic''' (basal levels of viral replication without stimulating an immune response). In acute infections, lytic viruses are shed at high titres for rapid infection to a secondary tissue/host, whereas persistent viruses undergo shedding at lower titres for a longer duration of transmission (months to years).<ref name=\"Nathanson\" />\n\nLytic viruses are capable of destroying host cells by incurring and/or interfering with the specialised functions of host cells. An example would be the triggering of [[necrosis]] in host cells infected with the virus. Otherwise, signatures of viral infection, like the binding of HIV to co-receptors CCR5 or CXCR4, can also trigger cell death via [[apoptosis]] through host signalling cascades by immune cells. However, many viruses encode proteins that can modulate apoptosis depending on whether the infection is acute or persistent. Induction of apoptosis, such as through interaction with [[caspase]]s, will promote viral shedding for lytic viruses to facilitate transmission, while viral inhibition of apoptosis could prolong the production of virus in cells, or allow the virus to remain hidden from the immune system in chronic, persistent infections.<ref> {{Cite journal | author=Fuentes-Gonz\u00e1lez AM, Contreras-Paredes A, Manzo-Merino J, Lizano M | title=The modulation of apoptosis by oncogenic viruses | journal=[[Virology Journal]] | volume=10 | year=2013 | doi=10.1186/1743-422X-10-182 }}  </ref>  Nevertheless, induction of apoptosis in major immune cells or [[antigen-presenting cell]]s may also act as a mechanism of [[immunosuppression]] in persistent infections like HIV.
