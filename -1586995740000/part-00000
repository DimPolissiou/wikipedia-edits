{"title_page": "List of hop varieties", "text_new": "{{short description|Wikipedia list article}}\n{{Refimprove|date=March 2010}}\n[[File:Hopfendolde-mit-hopfengarten.jpg|thumb|[[Hallertau hops|Hallertau]] hop cone]]\nThis is a list of [[Plant variety (law)|varieties]] of [[Hops|hop]] (''[[Humulus lupulus]]'').\n\nAs there are male and female plants, the flowers (cones) of the female plant are fertilized by the pollen of the male flowers with the result that the female flowers form seeds. These seeds are eaten by birds and hence spread over vast distances. Hops, specifically their female plants, have been grown as a commercial crop for the brewing industry for many centuries in many countries. The first documented mention of a hop garden is in the will of [[Pepin the Short|Pepyn III]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2013}} The first breeding of different hop varieties took place at [[Wye College]] in [[Kent]], [[England]] by [[E. S. Salmon]] in 1919 when he bred the varieties \"[[#Brewer's Gold|Brewer's Gold]]\" and \"[[#Bullion|Bullion]]\". As of 2012, there are around 80 varieties in commercial use around the world, and considerably more in development/trials.\n{{TOC right}}\n\n==American==\n\n===Ahtanum brand YCR 1 cv===\nAhtanum brand YCR 1 cv is an aroma-type cultivar bred by Yakima Chief Ranches.

Breeding code 94-203-008.\n\n===Pride of Ringwood===\nUsed by Australian brewer Carlton and United Breweries to bitter all of its beers. The hop was created in 1953 at CUB's research facility in the Melbourne suburb of Ringwood, using open pollination of Pride of Kent females. Little historical information has been released by CUB on their web site. It is unique in being the only hop developed by one brewery, and used predominantly by that brewery. CUB's flagship beer VB changed from a red ale to a lager in the mid 1950s, and PoR is likely to have been the hop used for production.  The hop has a strong aroma, and an earthy-citrus flavor, for late boil additions. Initial additions yield a clean bitterness. Green hopping is reported to produce good results. The hop does not have a long shelf life. However, the variety is highly resistant to diseases, and it has little inter-annual variation. Commercial harvests are now mostly Super Pride.

These seeds are eaten by birds and hence spread over vast distances. Hops, specifically their female plants, have been grown as a commercial crop for the brewing industry for many centuries in many countries. The first documented mention of a hop garden is in the will of [[Pepin the Short|Pepyn III]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2013}} The first breeding of different hop varieties took place at [[Wye College]] in [[Kent]], [[England]] by [[E. S. Salmon]] in 1919 when he bred the varieties \"[[#Brewer's Gold|Brewer's Gold]]\" and \"[[#Bullion|Bullion]]\".

Generally portrayed as a dark, crime-ridden locale, writer/artist [[Frank Miller (comics)|Frank Miller]] has described Gotham City as New York City at night. It was originally strongly inspired by [[Trenton, Ontario]]'s history, location, atmosphere, and various architectural styles, and has since incorporated elements from New York City, Detroit, Pittsburgh, London and Chicago. [[Anton Furst]]'s designs of Gotham for [[Tim Burton]]'s ''[[Batman (1989 film)|Batman]]'' (1989) have been influential on subsequent portrayals: he set out to \"make Gotham City the ugliest and bleakest metropolis imaginable.\"<ref>[[Anton Furst]], [[Derek Meddings]], ''Visualizing Gotham: The Production Design of Batman'', 2005, [[Warner Home Video]].</ref>\n|-\n|[[Metropolis (comics)|Metropolis]] || ''[[Action Comics]]'' #16 (Sept 1939) || || [[DC Comics]] || A fictional American city that is the home of [[Superman]], and along with [[Smallville (comics)|Smallville]], one of the principal settings for all Superman comics, films, and other adaptations.\n|-\n|[[Bl\u00fcdhaven]]\n|''Nightwing'' Vol 1 #1\n|[[Chuck Dixon]], [[Scott McDaniel]]\n|[[DC Comics]]\n|A fictional American city located in [[New Jersey]]. A former whaling town, which was officially incorporated as a \"Commonwealth\" in 1912. The town had a generally poor socio-economic populace, owing in part to failed efforts to transform itself into a manufacturing and shipping center. In modern times, it became more dangerous than Gotham, ruled by gangs and a corrupt police department. [[Nightwing]] is the most common heroic presence. \n|-\n|[[Duckburg]]\n|''Walt Disney's Comics and Stories'' #49 (1944)\n|[[Carl Barks]]\n|[[Disney]]\n|Fictional city that appears in various Disney comic books and animated projects, located in the fictional state of Calisota. It is the home of [[Donald Duck]], [[Scrooge McDuck]], [[Huey, Dewey and Louie Duck]], [[Daisy Duck]], and most of their supporting cast. Various writers have given it a long and complex history; it was originally known as \"Fort Drake Borough\", a fort built in the 16th century by British explorer Sir [[Francis Drake]]. By the 19th century, the fort had been handed over by its departing British occupants to [[Cornelius Coot]], who renamed the fort \"Duckburg\".\n|-\n|[[District X]]\n|''New X-Men'' #127\n|[[Grant Morrison]], [[John Paul Leon]]\n|[[Marvel Comics]]\n|A ghetto like neighbourhood of [[New York City]], where most of the inhabitants are [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|Mutants]], with the rise of [[Manhattan]]'s mutant population coupled with racism among normal humans, led to mutants forming their own community in a ghetto established in or around Alphabet City, Manhattan; Middle East Side, Mutant Town are its other names. A series of explosions incinerated much of the neighborhood, with Arcade's force fields preventing fire fighters from entering the area until the entire district had been utterly annihilated. Now [[District X]] has been destroyed completely.\n|-\n|Basin City\n|''[[Dark Horse Presents Fifth Anniversary Special]]'' (April 1991)\n|[[Frank Miller (comics)|Frank Miller]]\n|[[Dark Horse Comics]]\n|A fictional town in the American west, almost universally called \"Sin City\".

Its exact location is unknown but it is presented to be a suburban town with parks, shopping malls, and restaurants. Publisher [[John L.
