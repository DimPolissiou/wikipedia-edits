It quickly became popular elsewhere, particularly so in Britain, where the tradition lasted longer than in the U.S., occurring on primetime TV, most famously in ''[[The Black and White Minstrel Show]]'', which ended in 1978,<ref name=\"Black_and_white_minstrel\">{{Harvnb|Strausbaugh|2006|p=62}}</ref> and in ''[[Are You Being Served?]]''{{'}}s Christmas specials [[List of Are You Being Served? episodes#Christmas special (1981)|in 1976]]<ref>{{cite episode |title=The Father Christmas Affair |episodelink= |series=Are You Being Served? |serieslink=Are You Being Served? |credits= |network=BBC1|station= |airdate=1976-12-06 |season= |seriesno=4 |number=7 |minutes= }}</ref> and finally [[List of Are You Being Served? episodes#Christmas special (1981)|in 1981]].<ref>{{cite episode |title=Roots? |episodelink= |series=Are You Being Served? |serieslink=Are You Being Served? |credits= |network=BBC1 |station= |airdate=1981-12-24 |season= |seriesno=8 |number=8 |minutes= }}</ref>\n\nIn both the United States and Britain, blackface was most commonly used in the minstrel performance tradition, which it both predated and outlasted. Early white performers in blackface used burnt cork and later [[greasepaint]] or shoe polish to blacken their skin and exaggerate their lips, often wearing woolly wigs, gloves, tailcoats, or ragged clothes to complete the transformation. Later, black artists also performed in blackface. The famous<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/feb/05/bloomsbury-dreadnought-hoax-recalled-letter How a bearded Virginia Woolf and her band of 'jolly savages' hoaxed the navy]</ref> [[Dreadnought hoax]] involved the use of blackface and costume in order for a group of high profile authors to gain access to a Military vessel.\n\nStereotypes embodied in the stock characters of blackface minstrels not only played a significant role in cementing and proliferating racist images, attitudes, and perceptions worldwide, but also in popularizing black culture.<ref>Lott, Eric. \"Blackface and Blackness: The Minstrel Show in American Culture\", in Annemarie Bean, James V.

[[Blackface in contemporary art]] remains in relatively limited use as a theatrical device and is more commonly used today as social commentary or [[satire]].

Initially, Rice and his peers performed only in relatively disreputable venues, but as blackface gained popularity they gained opportunities to perform as ''[[entr'acte]]s'' in theatrical venues of a higher class. Stereotyped blackface characters developed: buffoonish, lazy, superstitious, cowardly, and lascivious characters, who stole, lied pathologically, and mangled the English language. Early blackface minstrels were all male, so cross-dressing white men also played black women who were often portrayed as unappealingly and grotesquely mannish, in the matronly [[mammy archetype|mammy]] mold, or as highly sexually provocative. The 1830s American stage, where blackface first rose to prominence, featured similarly comic stereotypes of the clever Yankee and the larger-than-life Frontiersman;<ref>{{Harvnb|Strausbaugh|2006|p=27}}</ref> the late 19th- and early 20th-century American and British stage where it last prospered<ref name=\"autogenerated1\">{{Harvnb|Strausbaugh|2006|pp=130\u201331}}</ref> featured many other, mostly [[ethnicity|ethnically]]-based, comic stereotypes: conniving, venal [[Jew]]s;<ref>Jody Rosen (2006), album notes to ''Jewface'', Reboot Stereophonic CD RSR006</ref><ref name=\"Strausbaugh-131\">{{Harvnb|Strausbaugh|2006|p=131}}</ref> drunken brawling [[Ireland|Irishmen]] with [[wikt:blarney|blarney]] at the ready;<ref name=\"Strausbaugh-131\" /><ref>Michael C.

Some social commentators have stated that blackface provided an outlet for white peoples' fear of the unknown and the unfamiliar, and a socially acceptable way of expressing their feelings and fears about race and control. Writes Eric Lott in ''Love and Theft: Blackface Minstrelsy and the American Working Class'', \"The black mask offered a way to play with the collective fears of a degraded and threatening&nbsp;\u2013 and male&nbsp;\u2013 Other while at the same time maintaining some symbolic control over them.\"<ref>{{Harvnb|Lott|1993|p=25}}</ref>\n\nBlackface, at least initially, could also give voice to an oppositional dynamic that was prohibited by society.

Rice]] was singing, \"An' I caution all white dandies not to come in my way, / For if dey insult me, dey'll in de gutter lay.\" It also on occasion equated lower-class white and lower-class black audiences; while parodying Shakespeare, Rice sang, \"Aldough I'm a black man, de white is call'd my broder.\"<ref>{{cite book|last=Ashny|first=LeRoy|title=With Amusement for All|publisher=University Press of Kentucky|date=2006|pages=17\u201318}}</ref>\n\n=== Film ===\n\n[[File:Al Jolson Jazz Singer.JPG|thumbnail|Singer and actor [[Al Jolson]] wearing blackface in the musical film ''[[The Jazz Singer]]'']] Through the 1930s, many well-known entertainers of stage and screen also [[List of entertainers who performed in blackface|performed in blackface]].<ref>One extensive list can be found at {{Harvnb|Strausbaugh|2006|pp=222\u201325}}.</ref> White people who performed in blackface in film included [[Al Jolson]],<ref name=\"RJ-Smith\">Smith, Rj, \"[https://web.archive.org/web/20041124222423/http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1346/is_8_46/ai_76929846 Pardon the Expression]\" (book review), ''Los Angeles Magazine'', August 2001.

Thereafter, white people in blackface would appear almost exclusively in broad comedies or \"ventriloquizing\" blackness<ref>Michael Rogin, ''Blackface, White Noise: Jewish Immigrants in the Hollywood Melting Pot'' (1998), University of California Press, p. 79, {{ISBN|0520213807}}.</ref> in the context of a vaudeville or minstrel performance within a film.<ref>{{Harvnb|Strausbaugh|2006|p=214}}</ref> This stands in contrast to made-up white people routinely playing Native Americans, Asians, Arabs, and so forth, for several more decades.<ref>{{Harvnb|Strausbaugh|2006|pp=214\u201315}}</ref>\n\nBlackface makeup was largely eliminated even from live film comedy in the U.S. after the end of the 1930s, when public sensibilities regarding [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]] began to change and blackface became increasingly associated with racism and [[bigotry]].<ref name=Kenrick /> Still, the tradition did not end all at once. The radio program ''[[Amos 'n' Andy]]'' (1928\u201360) constituted a type of \"oral blackface\", in that the black characters were portrayed by white people and conformed to stage blackface stereotypes.<ref>{{Harvnb|Strausbaugh|2006|p=225}}; the televised version (1951\u201353) used African-American actors.</ref> The conventions of blackface also lived on unmodified at least into the 1950s in animated theatrical cartoons.

The story behind the ballet was inspired by a tone poem written by [[Nicolai Rimsky-Korsakov]]. In the ballet the leading female character, Zobeide, is seduced by a Golden Slave. The dancer who portrayed the Golden Slave, the first being [[Vaslav Nijinsky]], would have his face and body painted brown for the performance. This was done to show the audience the slave was of a darker complexion. Later in 1912, Fokine choreographed the ballet ''[[Petrushka (ballet)|Petrushka]]'', which centers around three puppets that come to life, Petrushka, the Ballerina, and the Moor. When the ballet premiered, the part of the Moor, first danced by Alexander Orlov, was performed in full blackface. The Moor puppet is first seen onstage playing with a coconut, which he attempts to open with his [[scimitar]]. His movements are apelike. The Moor seduces the Ballerina and later savagely cuts off the head of the puppet Petrushka. When ''Petrushka'' is performed today, the part of the Moor is still done in full blackface, or occasionally blueface. The blackface has not been publicly criticized in the ballet community. Black and brownface appear in other ballets today, such as ''[[La Bayad\u00e8re]]'' and ''[[Othello]]'', in the United States and Europe.<ref>Au, Susan. ''Ballet and Modern Dance'', 2nd ed.

This presumption of authenticity could be a bit of a trap, with white audiences seeing them more like \"animals in a zoo\"<ref>{{Harvnb|Toll|1974|p=206}}</ref> than skilled performers. Despite often smaller budgets and smaller venues, their public appeal sometimes rivalled that of white minstrel troupes. In March 1866, Booker and Clayton's Georgia Minstrels may have been the country's most popular troupe, and were certainly among the most critically acclaimed.<ref name=\"autogenerated4\">{{Harvnb|Toll|1974|p=205}}</ref>\n\nThese \"colored\" troupes&nbsp;\u2013 many using the name \"Georgia Minstrels\"<ref>{{Harvnb|Toll|1974|p=203}}</ref>&nbsp;\u2013 focused on \"plantation\" material, rather than the more explicit social commentary (and more nastily racist stereotyping) found in portrayals of northern black people.<ref>{{Harvnb|Toll|1974|pp=179, 198}}</ref> In the execution of authentic black music and the [[percussion instrument|percussive]], [[polyrhythm]]ic tradition of ''[[Juba dance|pattin' Juba]]'', when the only [[musical instrument|instruments]] performers used were their hands and feet, clapping and slapping their bodies and shuffling and stomping their feet, black troupes particularly excelled. One of the most successful black minstrel companies was [[Sam Hague]]'s Slave Troupe of Georgia Minstrels, managed by [[Charles Hicks]]. This company eventually was taken over by [[Charles Callendar]]. The Georgia Minstrels toured the United States and abroad and later became [[J. H. Haverly|Haverly's Colored Minstrels]].<ref name=\"autogenerated4\" />\n\nFrom the mid-1870s, as white blackface minstrelsy became increasingly lavish and moved away from \"Negro subjects\", black troupes took the opposite tack.<ref>{{Harvnb|Toll|1974|p=234}}</ref> The popularity of the [[Fisk Jubilee Singers]] and other ''jubilee singers'' had demonstrated northern white interest in white religious music as sung by black people, especially [[spiritual (music)|spirituals]]. Some jubilee troupes pitched themselves as quasi-minstrels and even incorporated minstrel songs; meanwhile, blackface troupes began to adopt first jubilee material and then a broader range of southern black religious material. Within a few years, the word \"jubilee\", originally used by the Fisk Jubilee Singers to set themselves apart from blackface minstrels and to emphasize the religious character of their music, became little more than a synonym for \"plantation\" material.<ref>{{Harvnb|Toll|1974|pp=236\u201337, 244}}</ref> Where the jubilee singers tried to \"clean up\" Southern black religion for white consumption, blackface performers exaggerated its more exotic aspects.<ref>{{Harvnb|Toll|1974|p=243}}</ref>\n\nAfrican-American blackface productions also contained buffoonery and comedy, by way of self-parody. In the early days of African-American involvement in theatrical performance, black people could not perform without blackface makeup, regardless of how dark-skinned they were. The 1860s \"colored\" troupes violated this convention for a time: the comedy-oriented endmen \"corked up\", but the other performers \"astonished\" commentators by the diversity of their hues.<ref>{{Harvnb|Toll|1974|p=200}}</ref> Still, their performances were largely in accord with established blackface stereotypes.<ref>{{Harvnb|Toll|1974|p=180}}</ref>\n\nThese black performers became stars within the broad African-American community, but were largely ignored or condemned by the [[African-American upper class|black bourgeoisie]]. [[James Monroe Trotter]] &nbsp;\u2013 a middle-class African American who had contempt for their \"disgusting caricaturing\" but admired their \"highly musical culture\"&nbsp;\u2013 wrote in 1882 that \"few ... who condemned black minstrels for giving 'aid and comfort to the enemy'\" had ever seen them perform.<ref>{{Harvnb|Toll|1974|pp=226\u201328}}, including the quotation from Trotter.</ref> Unlike white audiences, black audiences presumably always recognized blackface performance as caricature, but took pleasure in seeing their own culture observed and reflected, much as they would half a century later in the performances of [[Moms Mabley]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Toll|1974|pp=258\u201359}}</ref>\n\nDespite reinforcing racist stereotypes, blackface minstrelsy was a practical and often relatively lucrative livelihood when compared to the menial labor to which most black people were relegated. Owing to the discrimination of the day, \"corking (or blacking) up\" provided an often singular opportunity for African-American musicians, actors, and dancers to practice their crafts.<ref>{{Harvnb|Toll|1974|p=195}}</ref> Some minstrel shows, particularly when performing outside the South, also managed subtly to poke fun at the racist attitudes and double standards of white society or champion the [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionist]] cause. It was through blackface performers, white and black, that the richness and exuberance of [[African-American music]], humor, and dance first reached mainstream, white audiences in the U.S. and abroad.<ref name=\"Watkins 82\" /> It was through blackface minstrelsy that African American performers first entered the mainstream of American show business.<ref>{{Harvnb|Toll|1974|p=228}}</ref> Black performers used blackface performance to satirize white behavior.

Called \"Toby\" for short, performers also nicknamed it \"Tough on Black Actors\" (or, variously, \"Artists\" or \"Asses\"), because earnings were so meager. Still, TOBA headliners like [[Tim Moore (comedian)|Tim Moore]] and Johnny Hudgins could make a very good living, and even for lesser players, TOBA provided fairly steady, more desirable work than generally was available elsewhere. Blackface served as a springboard for hundreds of artists and entertainers&nbsp;\u2013 black and white&nbsp;\u2013 many of whom later would go on to find work in other performance traditions. For example, one of the most famous stars of Haverly's European Minstrels was Sam Lucas, who became known as the \"Grand Old Man of the [[Negro]] Stage\".<ref>Johnson (1968). ''Black Manhattan'', p. 90. Quoted in {{Harvnb|Toll|1974|p=218}}</ref> Lucas later played the title role in the 1914 cinematic production of [[Harriet Beecher Stowe]]'s ''Uncle Tom's Cabin''. From the early 1930s to the late 1940s, New York City's famous [[Apollo Theater]] in [[Harlem]] featured skits in which almost all black male performers wore the blackface makeup and huge white painted lips, despite protests that it was degrading from the NAACP. The comics said they felt \"naked\" without it.<ref name=fox />{{rp|4, 1983 ed.}}\n\nThe minstrel show was appropriated by the black performer from the original white shows, but only in its general form. Black people took over the form and made it their own. The professionalism of performance came from black theater. Some argue that the black minstrels gave the shows vitality and humor that the white shows never had. As the black social critic [[Amiri Baraka|LeRoi Jones]] has written:\n\n{{quote|It is essential to realize that ... the idea of white men imitating, or caricaturing, what they consider certain generic characteristics of the black man's life in America is important if only because of the Negro's reaction to it. (And it is the Negro's ''reaction'' to America, first white and then black and white America, that I consider to have made him such a unique member of this society.)<ref name=leroy /> }}\n\nThe black minstrel performer was not only poking fun at himself but in a more profound way, he was poking fun at the white man. The [[cakewalk]] is caricaturing white customs, while white theater companies attempted to satirize the cakewalk as a black dance. Again, as LeRoi Jones notes:\n\n{{quote|If the cakewalk is a Negro dance caricaturing certain white customs, what is that dance when, say, a white theater company attempts to satirize it as a Negro dance? I find the idea of white minstrels in blackface satirizing a dance satirizing themselves a remarkable kind of irony&nbsp;\u2013 which, I suppose is the whole point of minstrel shows.<ref name=leroy>{{cite book|first= Leroy|last= Jones|authorlink= |title= Blues People: The Negro Experience in White America and the Music that Developed from It|publisher= TMorrow Quill Paperbacks|year= 1963|location= NY|pages= [https://archive.org/details/bluespeoplenegroexp00bara/page/85 85\u201386]|isbn= 978-0-688-18474-2|url= https://archive.org/details/bluespeoplenegroexp00bara/page/85}}</ref> }}\n\n== Authentic or counterfeit ==\n\nThe degree to which blackface performance drew on authentic black culture and traditions is controversial. Blacks, including slaves, were influenced by white culture, including white musical culture. Certainly this was the case with church music from very early times. Complicating matters further, once the blackface era began, some blackface minstrel songs unquestionably written by New York-based professionals (Stephen Foster, for example) made their way to the plantations in the South and merged into the body of black folk music.<ref>{{Harvnb|Strausbaugh|2006|pp=70\u201372}}</ref>\n\nIt seems clear, however, that American music by the early 19th century was an interwoven mixture of many influences, and that blacks were quite aware of white musical traditions and incorporated these into their music.\n\n{{quote|In the early years of the nineteenth century, white-to-black and black-to-white musical influences were widespread, a fact documented in numerous contemporary accounts....

Well into the 20th century, scholars took the stories at face value.<ref>{{Harvnb|Strausbaugh|2006|p=69}}</ref> [[Constance Rourke]], one of the founders of what is now known as [[cultural studies]], largely assumed this as late as 1931.<ref>{{Harvnb|Strausbaugh|2006|pp=27\u201328}}</ref> In the Civil Rights era there was a strong reaction against this view, to the point of denying that blackface was anything other than a white racist counterfeit.<ref>{{Harvnb|Strausbaugh|2006|p=70}}</ref> Starting no later than Robert Toll's ''Blacking Up'' (1974), a \"third wave\" has systematically studied the origins of blackface, and has put forward a nuanced picture: that blackface did, indeed, draw on black culture, but that it transformed, stereotyped, and caricatured that culture, resulting in often racist representations of black characters<ref>{{Harvnb|Strausbaugh|2006|p=70}}; {{Harvnb|Toll|1974}} ''passim.''</ref>\n\nAs discussed above, this picture becomes even more complicated after the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], when many blacks became blackface performers. They drew on much material of undoubted slave origins, but they also drew on a professional performer's instincts, while working within an established genre, and with the same motivation as white performers to make exaggerated claims of the authenticity of their own material.\n\nAuthor Strausbaugh summed up as follows: \"Some minstrel songs started as Negro folk songs, were adapted by White minstrels, became widely popular, and were readopted by Blacks,\" writes Strausbaugh. \"The question of whether minstrelsy was white or black music was moot.

It quickly became popular elsewhere, particularly so in Britain, where the tradition lasted longer than in the U.S., occurring on primetime TV, most famously in ''[[The Black and White Minstrel Show]]'', which ended in 1978,<ref name=\"Black_and_white_minstrel\">{{Harvnb|Strausbaugh|2006|p=62}}</ref> and in ''[[Are You Being Served?]]''{{'}}s Christmas specials [[List of Are You Being Served? episodes#Christmas special (1981)|in 1976]]<ref>{{cite episode |title=The Father Christmas Affair |episodelink= |series=Are You Being Served? |serieslink=Are You Being Served? |credits= |network=BBC1|station= |airdate=1976-12-06 |season= |seriesno=4 |number=7 |minutes= }}</ref> and finally [[List of Are You Being Served? episodes#Christmas special (1981)|in 1981]].<ref>{{cite episode |title=Roots? |episodelink= |series=Are You Being Served? |serieslink=Are You Being Served? |credits= |network=BBC1 |station= |airdate=1981-12-24 |season= |seriesno=8 |number=8 |minutes= }}</ref>\n\nIn both the United States and Britain, blackface was most commonly used in the minstrel performance tradition, which it both predated and outlasted. Early white performers in blackface used burnt cork and later [[greasepaint]] or shoe polish to blacken their skin and exaggerate their lips, often wearing woolly wigs, gloves, tailcoats, or ragged clothes to complete the transformation. Later, black artists also performed in blackface. The famous<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/feb/05/bloomsbury-dreadnought-hoax-recalled-letter How a bearded Virginia Woolf and her band of 'jolly savages' hoaxed the navy]</ref> [[Dreadnought hoax]] involved the use of blackface and costume in order for a group of high profile authors to gain access to a Military vessel.\n\nStereotypes embodied in the stock characters of blackface minstrels not only played a significant role in cementing and proliferating racist images, attitudes, and perceptions worldwide, but also in popularizing black culture.<ref>Lott, Eric. \"Blackface and Blackness: The Minstrel Show in American Culture\", in Annemarie Bean, James V.

[[Blackface in contemporary art]] remains in relatively limited use as a theatrical device and is more commonly used today as social commentary or [[satire]].

Initially, Rice and his peers performed only in relatively disreputable venues, but as blackface gained popularity they gained opportunities to perform as ''[[entr'acte]]s'' in theatrical venues of a higher class. Stereotyped blackface characters developed: buffoonish, lazy, superstitious, cowardly, and lascivious characters, who stole, lied pathologically, and mangled the English language. Early blackface minstrels were all male, so cross-dressing white men also played black women who were often portrayed as unappealingly and grotesquely mannish, in the matronly [[mammy archetype|mammy]] mold, or as highly sexually provocative. The 1830s American stage, where blackface first rose to prominence, featured similarly comic stereotypes of the clever Yankee and the larger-than-life Frontiersman;<ref>{{Harvnb|Strausbaugh|2006|p=27}}</ref> the late 19th- and early 20th-century American and British stage where it last prospered<ref name=\"autogenerated1\">{{Harvnb|Strausbaugh|2006|pp=130\u201331}}</ref> featured many other, mostly [[ethnicity|ethnically]]-based, comic stereotypes: conniving, venal [[Jew]]s;<ref>Jody Rosen (2006), album notes to ''Jewface'', Reboot Stereophonic CD RSR006</ref><ref name=\"Strausbaugh-131\">{{Harvnb|Strausbaugh|2006|p=131}}</ref> drunken brawling [[Ireland|Irishmen]] with [[wikt:blarney|blarney]] at the ready;<ref name=\"Strausbaugh-131\" /><ref>Michael C.

Some social commentators have stated that blackface provided an outlet for white peoples' fear of the unknown and the unfamiliar, and a socially acceptable way of expressing their feelings and fears about race and control. Writes Eric Lott in ''Love and Theft: Blackface Minstrelsy and the American Working Class'', \"The black mask offered a way to play with the collective fears of a degraded and threatening&nbsp;\u2013 and male&nbsp;\u2013 Other while at the same time maintaining some symbolic control over them.\"<ref>{{Harvnb|Lott|1993|p=25}}</ref>\n\nBlackface, at least initially, could also give voice to an oppositional dynamic that was prohibited by society.

Thereafter, white people in blackface would appear almost exclusively in broad comedies or \"ventriloquizing\" blackness<ref>Michael Rogin, ''Blackface, White Noise: Jewish Immigrants in the Hollywood Melting Pot'' (1998), University of California Press, p. 79, {{ISBN|0520213807}}.</ref> in the context of a vaudeville or minstrel performance within a film.<ref>{{Harvnb|Strausbaugh|2006|p=214}}</ref> This stands in contrast to made-up white people routinely playing Native Americans, Asians, Arabs, and so forth, for several more decades.<ref>{{Harvnb|Strausbaugh|2006|pp=214\u201315}}</ref>\n\nBlackface makeup was largely eliminated even from live film comedy in the U.S. after the end of the 1930s, when public sensibilities regarding [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]] began to change and blackface became increasingly associated with racism and [[bigotry]].<ref name=Kenrick /> Still, the tradition did not end all at once. The radio program ''[[Amos 'n' Andy]]'' (1928\u201360) constituted a type of \"oral blackface\", in that the black characters were portrayed by white people and conformed to stage blackface stereotypes.<ref>{{Harvnb|Strausbaugh|2006|p=225}}; the televised version (1951\u201353) used African-American actors.</ref> The conventions of blackface also lived on unmodified at least into the 1950s in animated theatrical cartoons.

The story behind the ballet was inspired by a tone poem written by [[Nicolai Rimsky-Korsakov]]. In the ballet the leading female character, Zobeide, is seduced by a Golden Slave. The dancer who portrayed the Golden Slave, the first being [[Vaslav Nijinsky]], would have his face and body painted brown for the performance. This was done to show the audience the slave was of a darker complexion. Later in 1912, Fokine choreographed the ballet ''[[Petrushka (ballet)|Petrushka]]'', which centers around three puppets that come to life, Petrushka, the Ballerina, and the Moor. When the ballet premiered, the part of the Moor, first danced by Alexander Orlov, was performed in full blackface. The Moor puppet is first seen onstage playing with a coconut, which he attempts to open with his [[scimitar]]. His movements are apelike. The Moor seduces the Ballerina and later savagely cuts off the head of the puppet Petrushka. When ''Petrushka'' is performed today, the part of the Moor is still done in full blackface, or occasionally blueface. The blackface has not been publicly criticized in the ballet community. Black and brownface appear in other ballets today, such as ''[[La Bayad\u00e8re]]'' and ''[[Othello]]'', in the United States and Europe.<ref>Au, Susan. ''Ballet and Modern Dance'', 2nd ed.

These \"colored minstrels\"<ref>{{Harvnb|Toll|1974|p=199}}</ref> always claimed to be recently freed slaves (doubtlessly many were, but most were not)<ref>{{Harvnb|Toll|1974|pp=198, 236\u201337}}</ref> and were widely seen as authentic. This presumption of authenticity could be a bit of a trap, with white audiences seeing them more like \"animals in a zoo\"<ref>{{Harvnb|Toll|1974|p=206}}</ref> than skilled performers. Despite often smaller budgets and smaller venues, their public appeal sometimes rivalled that of white minstrel troupes. In March 1866, Booker and Clayton's Georgia Minstrels may have been the country's most popular troupe, and were certainly among the most critically acclaimed.<ref name=\"autogenerated4\">{{Harvnb|Toll|1974|p=205}}</ref>\n\nThese \"colored\" troupes&nbsp;\u2013 many using the name \"Georgia Minstrels\"<ref>{{Harvnb|Toll|1974|p=203}}</ref>&nbsp;\u2013 focused on \"plantation\" material, rather than the more explicit social commentary (and more nastily racist stereotyping) found in portrayals of northern black people.<ref>{{Harvnb|Toll|1974|pp=179, 198}}</ref> In the execution of authentic black music and the [[percussion instrument|percussive]], [[polyrhythm]]ic tradition of ''[[Juba dance|pattin' Juba]]'', when the only [[musical instrument|instruments]] performers used were their hands and feet, clapping and slapping their bodies and shuffling and stomping their feet, black troupes particularly excelled. One of the most successful black minstrel companies was [[Sam Hague]]'s Slave Troupe of Georgia Minstrels, managed by [[Charles Hicks]]. This company eventually was taken over by [[Charles Callendar]]. The Georgia Minstrels toured the United States and abroad and later became [[J. H. Haverly|Haverly's Colored Minstrels]].<ref name=\"autogenerated4\" />\n\nFrom the mid-1870s, as white blackface minstrelsy became increasingly lavish and moved away from \"Negro subjects\", black troupes took the opposite tack.<ref>{{Harvnb|Toll|1974|p=234}}</ref> The popularity of the [[Fisk Jubilee Singers]] and other ''jubilee singers'' had demonstrated northern white interest in white religious music as sung by black people, especially [[spiritual (music)|spirituals]]. Some jubilee troupes pitched themselves as quasi-minstrels and even incorporated minstrel songs; meanwhile, blackface troupes began to adopt first jubilee material and then a broader range of southern black religious material. Within a few years, the word \"jubilee\", originally used by the Fisk Jubilee Singers to set themselves apart from blackface minstrels and to emphasize the religious character of their music, became little more than a synonym for \"plantation\" material.<ref>{{Harvnb|Toll|1974|pp=236\u201337, 244}}</ref> Where the jubilee singers tried to \"clean up\" Southern black religion for white consumption, blackface performers exaggerated its more exotic aspects.<ref>{{Harvnb|Toll|1974|p=243}}</ref>\n\nAfrican-American blackface productions also contained buffoonery and comedy, by way of self-parody. In the early days of African-American involvement in theatrical performance, black people could not perform without blackface makeup, regardless of how dark-skinned they were. The 1860s \"colored\" troupes violated this convention for a time: the comedy-oriented endmen \"corked up\", but the other performers \"astonished\" commentators by the diversity of their hues.<ref>{{Harvnb|Toll|1974|p=200}}</ref> Still, their performances were largely in accord with established blackface stereotypes.<ref>{{Harvnb|Toll|1974|p=180}}</ref>\n\nThese black performers became stars within the broad African-American community, but were largely ignored or condemned by the [[African-American upper class|black bourgeoisie]]. [[James Monroe Trotter]] &nbsp;\u2013 a middle-class African American who had contempt for their \"disgusting caricaturing\" but admired their \"highly musical culture\"&nbsp;\u2013 wrote in 1882 that \"few ... who condemned black minstrels for giving 'aid and comfort to the enemy'\" had ever seen them perform.<ref>{{Harvnb|Toll|1974|pp=226\u201328}}, including the quotation from Trotter.</ref> Unlike white audiences, black audiences presumably always recognized blackface performance as caricature, but took pleasure in seeing their own culture observed and reflected, much as they would half a century later in the performances of [[Moms Mabley]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Toll|1974|pp=258\u201359}}</ref>\n\nDespite reinforcing racist stereotypes, blackface minstrelsy was a practical and often relatively lucrative livelihood when compared to the menial labor to which most black people were relegated. Owing to the discrimination of the day, \"corking (or blacking) up\" provided an often singular opportunity for African-American musicians, actors, and dancers to practice their crafts.<ref>{{Harvnb|Toll|1974|p=195}}</ref> Some minstrel shows, particularly when performing outside the South, also managed subtly to poke fun at the racist attitudes and double standards of white society or champion the [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionist]] cause. It was through blackface performers, white and black, that the richness and exuberance of [[African-American music]], humor, and dance first reached mainstream, white audiences in the U.S. and abroad.<ref name=\"Watkins 82\" /> It was through blackface minstrelsy that African American performers first entered the mainstream of American show business.<ref>{{Harvnb|Toll|1974|p=228}}</ref> Black performers used blackface performance to satirize white behavior. It was also a forum for the sexual [[double entendre]] gags that were frowned upon by white moralists.

Called \"Toby\" for short, performers also nicknamed it \"Tough on Black Actors\" (or, variously, \"Artists\" or \"Asses\"), because earnings were so meager. Still, TOBA headliners like [[Tim Moore (comedian)|Tim Moore]] and Johnny Hudgins could make a very good living, and even for lesser players, TOBA provided fairly steady, more desirable work than generally was available elsewhere. Blackface served as a springboard for hundreds of artists and entertainers&nbsp;\u2013 black and white&nbsp;\u2013 many of whom later would go on to find work in other performance traditions. For example, one of the most famous stars of Haverly's European Minstrels was Sam Lucas, who became known as the \"Grand Old Man of the [[Negro]] Stage\".<ref>Johnson (1968). ''Black Manhattan'', p. 90. Quoted in {{Harvnb|Toll|1974|p=218}}</ref> Lucas later played the title role in the 1914 cinematic production of [[Harriet Beecher Stowe]]'s ''Uncle Tom's Cabin''. From the early 1930s to the late 1940s, New York City's famous [[Apollo Theater]] in [[Harlem]] featured skits in which almost all black male performers wore the blackface makeup and huge white painted lips, despite protests that it was degrading from the NAACP. The comics said they felt \"naked\" without it.<ref name=fox />{{rp|4, 1983 ed.}}\n\nThe minstrel show was appropriated by the black performer from the original white shows, but only in its general form. Black people took over the form and made it their own. The professionalism of performance came from black theater. Some argue that the black minstrels gave the shows vitality and humor that the white shows never had. As the black social critic [[Amiri Baraka|LeRoi Jones]] has written:\n\n{{quote|It is essential to realize that ... the idea of white men imitating, or caricaturing, what they consider certain generic characteristics of the black man's life in America is important if only because of the Negro's reaction to it. (And it is the Negro's ''reaction'' to America, first white and then black and white America, that I consider to have made him such a unique member of this society.)<ref name=leroy /> }}\n\nThe black minstrel performer was not only poking fun at himself but in a more profound way, he was poking fun at the white man. The [[cakewalk]] is caricaturing white customs, while white theater companies attempted to satirize the cakewalk as a black dance. Again, as LeRoi Jones notes:\n\n{{quote|If the cakewalk is a Negro dance caricaturing certain white customs, what is that dance when, say, a white theater company attempts to satirize it as a Negro dance?

Blacks, including slaves, were influenced by white culture, including white musical culture. Certainly this was the case with church music from very early times. Complicating matters further, once the blackface era began, some blackface minstrel songs unquestionably written by New York-based professionals (Stephen Foster, for example) made their way to the plantations in the South and merged into the body of black folk music.<ref>{{Harvnb|Strausbaugh|2006|pp=70\u201372}}</ref>\n\nIt seems clear, however, that American music by the early 19th century was an interwoven mixture of many influences, and that blacks were quite aware of white musical traditions and incorporated these into their music.\n\n{{quote|In the early years of the nineteenth century, white-to-black and black-to-white musical influences were widespread, a fact documented in numerous contemporary accounts....

Well into the 20th century, scholars took the stories at face value.<ref>{{Harvnb|Strausbaugh|2006|p=69}}</ref> [[Constance Rourke]], one of the founders of what is now known as [[cultural studies]], largely assumed this as late as 1931.<ref>{{Harvnb|Strausbaugh|2006|pp=27\u201328}}</ref> In the Civil Rights era there was a strong reaction against this view, to the point of denying that blackface was anything other than a white racist counterfeit.<ref>{{Harvnb|Strausbaugh|2006|p=70}}</ref> Starting no later than Robert Toll's ''Blacking Up'' (1974), a \"third wave\" has systematically studied the origins of blackface, and has put forward a nuanced picture: that blackface did, indeed, draw on black culture, but that it transformed, stereotyped, and caricatured that culture, resulting in often racist representations of black characters<ref>{{Harvnb|Strausbaugh|2006|p=70}}; {{Harvnb|Toll|1974}} ''passim.''</ref>\n\nAs discussed above, this picture becomes even more complicated after the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], when many blacks became blackface performers. They drew on much material of undoubted slave origins, but they also drew on a professional performer's instincts, while working within an established genre, and with the same motivation as white performers to make exaggerated claims of the authenticity of their own material.\n\nAuthor Strausbaugh summed up as follows: \"Some minstrel songs started as Negro folk songs, were adapted by White minstrels, became widely popular, and were readopted by Blacks,\" writes Strausbaugh. \"The question of whether minstrelsy was white or black music was moot.

The Guise dancers (disguised dancers) also wished to avoid any punishment for their mocking songs embarrassing the local gentry.\n\nIn [[Bacup]], [[Lancashire]], the [[Britannia Coconut Dancers]] wear black faces. Some{{Who|date=December 2013}} believe the origin of this dance can be traced back to the influx of Cornish miners to northern England, and the black face relates to the dirty blackened faces associated with mining.\n\nIn [[Cornwall]], several [[Mummer's Day]] celebrations are still held; these used to be sometimes known as \"Darkie Day\" (a corruption of the original \"Darking Day\", referring to the darkening or painting of the faces) and involved local residents dancing through the streets in blackface to musical accompaniment. The origins of blacking-up for Mummer's Day have no racial connotations; the tradition is pagan in origin and goes back to the days of the Celts. When minstrel songs were part of British popular culture, at least one festival ([[Padstow]]) used such songs, including the words \"He's gone where the good niggers go\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pdk4v11U4tQ |title=Darkie Day |publisher=YouTube |date= |accessdate=2011-07-11}}</ref>\n\nThe traditional [[Chimney sweep#Good luck omen|wedding day chimney sweep]], that is considered to be good luck, sometimes has a partially blacked up face to suggest smears of soot.

As Spanish-speakers from different countries, ethnic, racial, class, and educational backgrounds settle in the United States, they have to grapple with being re-classified vis-a-vis other American-born and immigrant groups. Blackface performances have, for instance, tried to work through U.S. racial and ethnic classifications in conflict with national identities.

Soviet actors portrayed black people mostly by darkening the skin and occasionally adjusting the hair style, without accentuating or exaggerating their facial features. In particular, [[Vladimir Vysotsky]] performed the role of [[Abram Petrovich Gannibal]], an 18th-century Russian general of African origin, in the 1976 Soviet film ''[[How Czar Peter the Great Married Off His Moor]]'', while [[Larisa Dolina]] performed the role of Cuban singer Clementine Fernandez in the 1983 film ''[[We Are from Jazz]]''.

However, delays to the electrification project mean the 380s did not run until December 2017 and the 385s did not run until July 2018.\n\n== Places served ==\nThe route serves the following places ([[Ordnance Survey]] [[British national grid reference system|grid references]] for stations):\n\n{|-\n| '''Places''' || '''Grid references'''\n|-\n| [[Glasgow]] || {{gbmappingsmall|NS592655}}\n|-\n| [[Lenzie]] || {{gbmappingsmall|NS655719}}\n|-\n| [[Croy, North Lanarkshire|Croy]] || {{gbmappingsmall|NS729755}}\n|-\n| [[Falkirk]] || {{gbmappingsmall|NS882790}}\n|-\n| [[Polmont]] || {{gbmappingsmall|NS930781}}\n|-\n| [[Linlithgow]] || {{gbmappingsmall|NT005770}}\n|-\n| [[Haymarket, Edinburgh|Haymarket]] || {{gbmappingsmall|NT239731}}\n|-\n| [[Edinburgh]] || {{gbmappingsmall|NT257738}}\n|}\n\n==Services==\n{{unreferenced section|date=January 2017}}\nPassenger services are operated by [[Abellio ScotRail]]. The line is [[Railway electrification in Great Britain|electrified]]. The \"(Glasgow Queen Street-Edinburgh Haymarket) Shuttle\" weekday day time service pattern sees a train every 15 minutes from Glasgow/Edinburgh. All trains stop at Falkirk High and Haymarket, with selected trains stopping at Croy, Polmont and Linlithgow.\n\nThe Sunday service sees a train every 30 minutes from Glasgow/Edinburgh with all trains calling at Falkirk High and Haymarket and a train every hour at Croy, Polmont and Linlithgow. However, both Linlithgow and Polmont also benefit from the Edinburgh\u2013Dunblane line every half hour on a Sunday.\n\n==Rolling stock==\n{{unreferenced section|date=January 2017}}\n=== 1950s/60s ===\nAs part of a review by the [[British Transport Commission]] report in 1952, the services were provided by the 1956 batch of [[British Rail Class 126|Class 126]] DMU, entering service in 1957.\n\n=== 1970s ===\nIn 1971, the stock provided changed to locomotives fitted for Blue Star [[multiple working]].

Also during this period, [[InterCity (British Rail)|InterCity]] provided through services from Glasgow Queen Street to [[London King's Cross railway station|London King's Cross]] and various [[West Country]] destinations, resulting in the use of [[InterCity 125]]s on the route.\n\nAt this time, the service operated on a half-hourly frequency with all trains stopping at Haymarket and Falkirk High, with alternate trains stopping at Polmont and Linlithgow. Some peak hour trains stopped at Bishopbriggs, Lenzie and Croy. Sunday trains served {{Stnlnk|Falkirk Grahamston}}.\n\nIn 1984 the [[Polmont rail accident]], where a train hit a cow on the track (part of the cow's leg was trapped in the bogie of the train, lifting it off the track) resulted in 13 deaths and 61 injuries.

{"title_page": "Chidiock Tichborne", "text_new": "{{EngvarB|date=June 2017}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=June 2017}}\n'''Chidiock Tichborne''' (after 24 August 1562 \u2013 20 September 1586), erroneously{{cn|date=March 2017}} referred to as Charles, was an English [[Conspiracy (political)|conspirator]] and poet.\n\n==Life==\n\nTichborne was born in [[Southampton]] sometime after 24 August 1562<ref name=\"Phillimore 1904\">Phillimore, Hampshire Parish Records, Vol VI, page 78, marriage of Peter Tychborne, gent to Elizabeth Midleton, 24 August 1562</ref> to [[Roman Catholic]] parents, Peter Tichborne and his wife Elizabeth (n\u00e9e Middleton).<ref name=\"Penry Williams 1586\">Penry Williams, 'Babington, Anthony (1561\u20131586)', Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004</ref> His birth date has been given as circa 1558 in many sources, though unverified, and thus his age given as 28 at his execution. It is unlikely that he was born before his parents' marriage, so he could have been no more than 23 years old when he died.\n\nChidiock Tichborne descended from Sir Roger de Tichborne, who owned land at [[Tichborne]], near Winchester, in the twelfth century. Chidiock's second cousin and contemporary was [[Sir Benjamin Tichborne, 1st Baronet|Sir Benjamin Tichborne]] who lived at Tichborne Park and was created a [[Tichborne Baronets|Baronet]] by [[King James I of England|King James I]] in 1621. The Tichborne family is ancient and believed to have held land at Tichborne from before the Norman Conquest. In Chidiock's reported oration from the scaffold before his execution he allegedly stated:  \"I am descended from a house, from two hundred years before the Conquest, never stained till this my misfortune\".<ref>Isaac D'Israeli (circa 1859) (1st collected edition 1881) ''Curiosities of Literature'', Vol II, pp177</ref>\n\nChidiock's father Peter appears to have been the youngest son of Henry Tichborne (born circa 1474) and Anne Mervin (or Marvin) but the records are unclear. Peter was clerk of the Crowne at the trial of Sir Nicholas Throckmorton in 1554 and was an ardent Catholic supporter. Being the youngest son of a youngest son he was of little means and required to make his own way. He secured an education and the patronage of his distant kinsman, Lord Chidiock Paulet (1521\u20131574, son of the 1st [[Marquess of Winchester]]), after whom he named his son. In later life he spent many years imprisoned unable to pay recusancy fines. Chidiock's mother was Elizabeth Middleton, daughter of William Middleton (grandson of Sir Thomas Middleton of Belso, Kt.) and Elizabeth Potter (daughter of John Potter of Westram). William had been servant to [[John Islip]], Abbot of Westminster, and a banner bearer at Islip's funeral 1532,<ref>Kenning's Masonic Encyclopedia and Handbook of Masonic Archeology, History and Biography (1878) page 299</ref> and later bought lands in Kent.\n\nThe name ''\"Chidiock\"'', pronounced \u2018chidik\u2019, as derived from his father's patron, [[Chidiock Paulet]], originates from a Paulet ancestor, Sir John de Chideock, who owned land at Chideock, a village in Dorset. Chidiock Tichborne was never called Charles \u2013 this is an error that has grown from a misprint in the [[Assessment and Qualifications Alliance|AQA]] GCSE English Literature syllabus which has included the Elegy in its early poetry section for several years. Unfortunately, this error persists in much of the educational literature supporting the syllabus.\n\nAt least two of Chidiock's sisters are recorded by name: Dorothy, first wife of Thomas Muttelbury of Jurdens, Somerset;<ref>Visitation Somerset 1623 (1876) page 76</ref> and Mary, second wife of Sir William Kirkham of [[Blagdon, Paignton|Blagdon]] in the parish of [[Paignton]] in Devon.<ref>Visitation of Kent 1574, page 9</ref> At his execution Chidiock mentions his wife Agnes, one child, and his six sisters. In his letter to his wife, written the night before his execution he mentions his sisters \u2013 and also 'my little sister Babb'.<ref>Harl. MSS. 36. 50. as quoted by Isaac D'Israeli, page 177</ref> Another sister is implied in a secret intelligence note to Francis Walsingham, dated 18 September 1586, in which the writer has had conference with \"Jennings of Portsmouth\" who reports that Mr Bruyn of Dorset and Mr Kyrkham of Devon are persons to be suspect as they had married Tychbourn's sisters.<ref>Cal. State Papers, Domestic Series, Reigns of Edward VI, Mary and Elizabeth I, 1547-(1625), Vol CXCII, Number 62</ref>\n\n==History==\n\nAfter the succession of [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]] to the throne after the death of [[Mary I of England|Mary I]], Chidiock was allowed to practice Catholicism for part of his early life.  However, in 1570 the Queen was [[excommunication|excommunicated]] by the Pope for her own Protestantism and support of [[Protestant]] causes, most notably the Dutch Rebellion against Spain; in retaliation she ended her relative toleration of the Catholic Church.  Catholicism was made illegal, and Roman Catholics were once more banned by law from practising their religion and Roman Catholic priests risked death for performing their functions.\n[[Image:Tower of London, Traitors Gate.jpg|thumb|150px|right|Tower of London, Traitor's Gate]]\n\nIn 1583, Tichborne and his father, Peter, were arrested and questioned concerning the use of \"popish relics\", religious objects Tichborne had brought back from a visit he had made abroad without informing the authorities of an intention to travel.<ref name=\"Penry Williams 1586\"/> Though released without charge, records suggest that this was not the last time they were to be questioned by the authorities over their religion. In June 1586 accusations of \"popish practices\" were laid against his family.\n\nIn June 1586, Tichborne agreed to take part in the [[Babington Plot]] to murder Queen Elizabeth and replace her with the Catholic [[Mary, Queen of Scots]], who was next in line to the throne.  The plot was foiled by Sir [[Francis Walsingham]], Elizabeth's spymaster, using [[double agent]]s, most notably [[Robert Poley]] who was later witness to the murder of [[Christopher Marlowe]], and though most of the conspirators fled, Tichborne had an injured leg and was forced to remain in London.  On 14 August he was arrested and he was later tried and sentenced to death in [[Westminster Hall]].\n\nWhile in custody in the [[Tower of London]] on 19 September (the eve of his [[execution (legal)|execution]]), Tichborne wrote to his wife Agnes.  The letter contained three [[stanza]]s of poetry that is his best known piece of work, ''Tichborne's Elegy'', also known by its first line ''My Prime of Youth is but a Frost of Cares''.  The poem is a dark look at a life cut short and is a favourite of many scholars to this day. Two other poems are known by him, ''To His Friend'' and ''The Housedove''.\n\nOn 20 September 1586, Tichborne was executed with [[Anthony Babington]], [[John Ballard (Jesuit)|John Ballard]], and four other conspirators. They were eviscerated, [[drawing and quartering|hanged, drawn and quartered]], the mandatory punishment for treason, in St Giles Field.  However, when Elizabeth was informed that these gruesome executions were arousing sympathy for the condemned, she ordered that the remaining seven conspirators were to be hanged until 'quite dead' before being eviscerated.\n\n==Tichborne's poetry==\n\n===Elegy and others===\n\n====Elegy====\n\n<poem>My prime of youth is but a frost of cares,\nMy feast of joy is but a dish of pain,\nMy crop of corn is but a field of tares,\nAnd all my good is but vain hope of gain;\nThe day is past, and yet I saw no sun,\nAnd now I live, and now my life is done.\n\nMy tale was heard and yet it was not told,\nMy fruit is fallen, and yet my leaves are green,\nMy youth is spent and yet I am not old,\nI saw the world and yet I was not seen;\nMy thread is cut and yet it is not spun,\nAnd now I live, and now my life is done.\n\nI sought my death and found it in my womb,\nI looked for life and saw it was a shade,\nI trod the earth and knew it was my tomb,\nAnd now I die, and now I was but made;\nMy glass is full, and now my glass is run,\nAnd now I live, and now my life is done.</poem>\n\nThis is the first printed version from ''Verses of Prayse and Joye'' (1586).  The original text differs slightly: along with other minor differences, the first line of the second verse reads \"The spring is past, and yet it hath not sprung,\" and the third line reads \"My youth is gone, and yet I am but young.\"\n\nThe last word in the third line, \"tares,\" refers to a harmful \"weed\" that resembles corn when young, and is a reference to Matt. 13:24\u201330.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/tare |title= Tare |publisher= Dictionary.com |accessdate= 12 January 2013}}</ref>\n\n====To His Friend (assumed to be Anthony Babington)====\n\n<poem>Good sorrow cease, false hope be gone, misfortune once farewell;\nCome, solemn muse, the sad discourse of our adventures tell.\nA friend I had whose special part made mine affection his;\nWe ruled tides and streams ourselves, no want was in our bliss.\nSix years we sailed, sea-room enough, by many happy lands,\nTill at the length, a stream us took and cast us on the sands.\nThere lodged we were in a gulf of woe, despairing what to do,\nTill at the length, from shore unknown, a Pilot to us drew,\nWhose help did sound our grounded ship from out Caribda's mouth,\nBut unadvised, on Scylla drives; the wind which from the South\nDid blustering blow the fatal blast of our unhappy fall,\nWhere driving, leaves my friend and I to fortune ever thrall;\nWhere we be worse beset with sands and rocks on every side,\nWhere we be quite bereft of aid, of men, of winds, of tide.\nWhere vain it is to hail for help so far from any shore,\nSo far from Pilot's course; despair shall we, therefore?\nNo! God from out his heap of helps on us will some bestow,\nAnd send such mighty surge of seas, or else such blasts to blow\nAs shall remove our grounded ship far from this dangerous place,\nAnd we shall joy each others' chance through God's almighty grace,\nAnd keep ourselves on land secure, our sail on safer seas.\nSweet friend, till then content thy self, and pray for our release.</poem>\n\n====The Housedove====\n\n<poem>A silly housedove happed to fall\namongst a flock of crows,\nWhich fed and filled her harmless craw\namongst her fatal foes.\nThe crafty fowler drew his net \u2013\nall his that he could catch \u2013\nThe crows lament their hellish chance,\nthe dove repents her match.\nBut too, too late! it was her chance\nthe fowler did her spy,\nAnd so did take her for a crow \u2013\nwhich thing caused her to die.</poem>\n\nThe only known manuscript versions of \"To His Friend\" and The Housedove\" are from Edinburgh Library MS Laing, II, 69/24. However, twenty-eight different manuscript versions of the \"Elegy\" (or \"Lament\") are known and there are many variations of the text.\n\n===Comment===\nTichborne's authorship of the Elegy has been disputed, with attributions to others including Sir [[Walter Raleigh]]. However it was printed soon after the Babington plot in a volume called ''Verses of Praise and Joy'' in 1586, published by [[John Wolfe (printer)|John Wolfe of London]] to celebrate the Queen's survival and to attack the plotters. In the same volume an answer poem entitled \"Hendecasyllabon T. K. in Cygneam Cantionem Chideochi Tychborne\" (\"T. K.'s Hendecasyllabon Against Chidiock Tichborne's Swan Song\") is most likely by the poet and dramatist [[Thomas Kyd]], author of ''[[The Spanish Tragedy]]''.\n\n====Hendecasyllabon T. K. in Cygneam Cantionem Chideochi Tychborne==== \n\n<poem>Thy prime of youth is frozen with thy faults,\nThy feast of joy is finisht with thy fall;\nThy crop of corn is tares availing naughts,\nThy good God knows thy hope, thy hap and all.\nShort were thy days, and shadowed was thy sun,\nT'obscure thy light unluckily begun.\n\nTime trieth truth, and truth hath treason tripped;\nThy faith bare fruit as thou hadst faithless been:\nThy ill spent youth thine after years hath nipt;\nAnd God that saw thee hath preserved our Queen.\nHer thread still holds, thine perished though unspun,\nAnd she shall live when traitors lives are done.\n\nThou soughtst thy death, and found it in desert,\nThou look'dst for life, yet lewdly forc'd it fade:\nThou trodst the earth, and now on earth thou art,\nAs men may wish thou never hadst been made.\nThy glory, and thy glass are timeless run;\nAnd this, O Tychborne, hath thy treason done.</poem>\n\n===Critical appreciation===\n\n====Elegy====\nTichborne's \"Elegy\" (his rhyming, final [[soliloquy]] poem<ref>Hirsch, Edward, ''How to read a Poem'', Harvest Harcourt Inc, New York, 1999 {{ISBN|9780156005661}}</ref>), uses two favourite Renaissance figures of speech \u2013 [[antithesis]] and [[paradox]] \u2013 to crystallise the tragedy of the poet's situation. Antithesis means setting opposites against each other: prime of youth / frost of cares (from the first line). This is typical of Renaissance poetry, as for example in Wyatt's \"I find no peace, and all my war is done\", with the lover freezing/burning. It also appears in the poem by Elizabeth I, \"I grieve and dare not show my discontent\", e.g., \"I am and not, I freeze and yet am burned.\" A paradox is a statement which seems self-contradictory, yet is true, e.g., \"My tale is heard, and yet it was not told\", or \"My glass is full, and now my glass is run.\" Often a Renaissance poem will begin with antithesis to establish circumstances and reveal its themes through paradox.\n\nThe \"Elegy\" is remarkable for being written almost entirely in [[Syllables|monosyllables]]: Every word in the poem is of one syllable, with ten words in each [[Line (poetry)|line]], [[monostich]] style), with the possible exception of the word \"fallen\". However, in early editions it was written as \"fall'n\" which is monosyllabic.<ref>[http://www.buckingham.ac.uk/english/schools/poetry-bank/tichborne University of Buckingham, England.] \"The poem is immediately striking both for its deft use of antithesis, and for its relative brevity and clarity. With the exception of 'fallen' (which in early editions is 'fall'n' and, as the metre indicates, pronounced as a monosyllable) every word in the poem is of one [[syllable]], something that adds to its stark and plain effect.\"</ref>\n\nThe \"Elegy\" has inspired many \"homages\" and \"answers\" including those by Jonathon Robin at allpoetry.com ; a rap version by David A More at www.marlovian.com ; ''After Reading Tichborne's Elegy'' by [[Dick Allen (poet)|Dick Allen]] (2003) and Tichborne's Lexicon by [[Nick Montfort]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://nickm.com/poems/noncomputational.html|title=Poems by Nick Montfort|website=nickm.com}}</ref>\n\nThe \"Elegy\" has also been set to music many times from the Elizabethan era to the present day by, among others, Michael East, Richard Alison (fl1580-1610, in ''An Hour's Recreation in musicke'', 1606), [[John Mundy (composer)|John Mundy]] (1592) and [[Charles-Fran\u00e7ois Gounod]] (1873) and more recently Norman Dello Joio (1949) and Jim Clark (see Tichborne's Elegy Poem Animation<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://wn.com/Tichborne%27s_Elegy_Poem_Animation|title=Tichborne's Elegy Poem Animation|website=World News}}</ref>) and Taylor Momsen. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBNQ1DIod6M|title=The Pretty Reckless - Hangman LYRIC video (with latin translated)|via=www.youtube.com}}</ref>\n\n====The Housedove====\n\n\"The Housedove\" exploits a popular image from the period: Tichborne sees himself as an innocent dove caught among his fellow conspirators, (see Shakespeare's ''Romeo and Juliet'' 1.5.48). The \"crafty fowler\" is probably Sir [[Francis Walsingham]], the spymaster who manipulated the Babington plot.\n\n==Sources==\n\n*Richard S. M.

God from out his heap of helps on us will some bestow,\nAnd send such mighty surge of seas, or else such blasts to blow\nAs shall remove our grounded ship far from this dangerous place,\nAnd we shall joy each others' chance through God's almighty grace,\nAnd keep ourselves on land secure, our sail on safer seas.\nSweet friend, till then content thy self, and pray for our release.</poem>\n\n====The Housedove====\n\n<poem>A silly housedove happed to fall\namongst a flock of crows,\nWhich fed and filled her harmless craw\namongst her fatal foes.\nThe crafty fowler drew his net \u2013\nall his that he could catch \u2013\nThe crows lament their hellish chance,\nthe dove repents her match.\nBut too, too late! it was her chance\nthe fowler did her spy,\nAnd so did take her for a crow \u2013\nwhich thing caused her to die.</poem>\n\nThe only known manuscript versions of \"To His Friend\" and The Housedove\" are from Edinburgh Library MS Laing, II, 69/24. However, twenty-eight different manuscript versions of the \"Elegy\" (or \"Lament\") are known and there are many variations of the text.\n\n===Comment===\nTichborne's authorship of the Elegy has been disputed, with attributions to others including Sir [[Walter Raleigh]]. However it was printed soon after the Babington plot in a volume called ''Verses of Praise and Joy'' in 1586, published by [[John Wolfe (printer)|John Wolfe of London]] to celebrate the Queen's survival and to attack the plotters. In the same volume an answer poem entitled \"Hendecasyllabon T. K. in Cygneam Cantionem Chideochi Tychborne\" (\"T. K.'s Hendecasyllabon Against Chidiock Tichborne's Swan Song\") is most likely by the poet and dramatist [[Thomas Kyd]], author of ''[[The Spanish Tragedy]]''.\n\n====Hendecasyllabon T. K. in Cygneam Cantionem Chideochi Tychborne==== \n\n<poem>Thy prime of youth is frozen with thy faults,\nThy feast of joy is finisht with thy fall;\nThy crop of corn is tares availing naughts,\nThy good God knows thy hope, thy hap and all.\nShort were thy days, and shadowed was thy sun,\nT'obscure thy light unluckily begun.\n\nTime trieth truth, and truth hath treason tripped;\nThy faith bare fruit as thou hadst faithless been:\nThy ill spent youth thine after years hath nipt;\nAnd God that saw thee hath preserved our Queen.\nHer thread still holds, thine perished though unspun,\nAnd she shall live when traitors lives are done.\n\nThou soughtst thy death, and found it in desert,\nThou look'dst for life, yet lewdly forc'd it fade:\nThou trodst the earth, and now on earth thou art,\nAs men may wish thou never hadst been made.\nThy glory, and thy glass are timeless run;\nAnd this, O Tychborne, hath thy treason done.</poem>\n\n===Critical appreciation===\n\n====Elegy====\nTichborne's \"Elegy\" (his rhyming, final [[soliloquy]] poem<ref>Hirsch, Edward, ''How to read a Poem'', Harvest Harcourt Inc, New York, 1999 {{ISBN|9780156005661}}</ref>), uses two favourite Renaissance figures of speech \u2013 [[antithesis]] and [[paradox]] \u2013 to crystallise the tragedy of the poet's situation. Antithesis means setting opposites against each other: prime of youth / frost of cares (from the first line). This is typical of Renaissance poetry, as for example in Wyatt's \"I find no peace, and all my war is done\", with the lover freezing/burning. It also appears in the poem by Elizabeth I, \"I grieve and dare not show my discontent\", e.g., \"I am and not, I freeze and yet am burned.\" A paradox is a statement which seems self-contradictory, yet is true, e.g., \"My tale is heard, and yet it was not told\", or \"My glass is full, and now my glass is run.\" Often a Renaissance poem will begin with antithesis to establish circumstances and reveal its themes through paradox.\n\nThe \"Elegy\" is remarkable for being written almost entirely in [[Syllables|monosyllables]]: Every word in the poem is of one syllable, with ten words in each [[Line (poetry)|line]], [[monostich]] style), with the possible exception of the word \"fallen\". However, in early editions it was written as \"fall'n\" which is monosyllabic.<ref>[http://www.buckingham.ac.uk/english/schools/poetry-bank/tichborne University of Buckingham, England.] \"The poem is immediately striking both for its deft use of antithesis, and for its relative brevity and clarity. With the exception of 'fallen' (which in early editions is 'fall'n' and, as the metre indicates, pronounced as a monosyllable) every word in the poem is of one [[syllable]], something that adds to its stark and plain effect.\"</ref>\n\nThe \"Elegy\" has inspired many \"homages\" and \"answers\" including those by Jonathon Robin at allpoetry.com ; a rap version by David A More at www.marlovian.com ; ''After Reading Tichborne's Elegy'' by [[Dick Allen (poet)|Dick Allen]] (2003) and Tichborne's Lexicon by [[Nick Montfort]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://nickm.com/poems/noncomputational.html|title=Poems by Nick Montfort|website=nickm.com}}</ref>\n\nThe \"Elegy\" has also been set to music many times from the Elizabethan era to the present day by, among others, Michael East, Richard Alison (fl1580-1610, in ''An Hour's Recreation in musicke'', 1606), [[John Mundy (composer)|John Mundy]] (1592) and [[Charles-Fran\u00e7ois Gounod]] (1873) and more recently Norman Dello Joio (1949) and Jim Clark (see Tichborne's Elegy Poem Animation<ref>http://wn.com/Tichborne's_Elegy_Poem_animation</ref>) and Taylor Momsen. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBNQ1DIod6M|title=The Pretty Reckless - Hangman LYRIC video (with latin translated)|via=www.youtube.com}}</ref>\n\n====The Housedove====\n\n\"The Housedove\" exploits a popular image from the period: Tichborne sees himself as an innocent dove caught among his fellow conspirators, (see Shakespeare's ''Romeo and Juliet'' 1.5.48). The \"crafty fowler\" is probably Sir [[Francis Walsingham]], the spymaster who manipulated the Babington plot.\n\n==Sources==\n\n*Richard S. M.
