The infectious agent responsible for the disease is '''rabbit haemorrhagic disease virus''' ('''RHDV'''), or '''rabbit calicivirus''' ('''RCV'''), genus ''[[Lagovirus]]'' of the family [[Caliciviridae]]. The virus infects only rabbits, and has been used in some countries to control rabbit populations.\n\n== RHDV1 and RHDV2 ==\n\nRabbit haemorrhagic disease virus (RHDV) is a single strand RNA virus in the genus Lagovirus and the family Caliciviridae. In the course of its evolution RHDV split into six distinct genotypes,<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Kerr |first1=P. J. |last2=Kitchen |first2=A. |last3=Holmes |first3=E. C. |title=Origin and Phylodynamics of Rabbit Hemorrhagic Disease Virus |journal=Journal of Virology |date=16 September 2009 |volume=83 |issue=23 |pages=12129\u201312138 |doi=10.1128/JVI.01523-09|doi-access=free }}</ref> all of which are highly pathogenic. In addition, non-pathogenic rabbit caliciviruses related to but distinct from RHDV have been identified in Europe and Australia.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Capucci |first1=L. |last2=Fusi |first2=P. |last3=Lavazza |first3=A. |last4=Pacciarini |first4=M.L. |last5=Rossi |first5=C. |title=Detection and preliminary characterization of a new rabbit calicivirus related to rabbit hemorrhagic disease virus but nonpathogenic |journal=Journal of Virology |date=December 1996 |volume=70 |issue=12 |pages=8614-8623}}</ref>\n\nThe two strains of rabbit hemorrhagic disease currently of medical significance are RHDV1 and RHDV2. RHDV1 (sometimes referred to simply as RHDV) only affects adult European rabbits (''Oryctolagus cuniculus''). This virus was first reported in China in 1984, from which it spread to much of Asia, Europe, Australia, and elsewhere. There have been a few isolated outbreaks of RHDV1 in the United States and Mexico, but they remained localized and were eradicated.\n\nRHDV2 first appeared in France in 2010, from which it spread to the rest of Europe, Great Britain, and Australia. This strain affects multiple lagomorph species, including ''Sylvilagus spp.'' (cottontail rabbits) and ''Lepus spp.'' (hares). It can also cause disease in young rabbits. RHDV2 appears to be replacing the RHDV1 strain in Australia. The 2019 and 2020 outbreaks of rabbit hemorrhagic disease in Washington state and Vancouver were caused by RHDV2. The 2020 outbreak of RHDV2 in Arizona, New Mexico, and Texas is affecting wild cottontails and hares as well as domestic European rabbits; since the virus has now spread into the wild rabbit populations, containment is unlikely.\n\nRHDV2 is distinct enough from RHDV1 that the two have different vaccines, which are only partially cross protective. Both viruses appear to spread via direct contact, fomites, biting insects (mechanical vectors only), and inhalation.\n\n== History ==\nRabbit hemorrhagic disease caused by RHDV1 first appeared in the Winter of 1983 in Jiangsu Province of the [[People's Republic of China]]. It was first isolated and characterized by S.J. Liu ''et al''. in 1984.<ref name=Merck>{{cite web | title = A New Viral Disease of Rabbit| work = The Merck Veterinary Manual | year = 2006 | url = http://www.merckvetmanual.com/mvm/index.jsp?cfile=htm/bc/171330.htm | accessdate = 2007-06-17 }}</ref> The Chinese outbreak was spread by the [[angora rabbit]], which had originated in [[Europe]]. Fourteen million domesticated rabbits died within nine months in the outbreak.<ref name=IAS>[http://www.cfsph.iastate.edu/Factsheets/pdfs/rabbit_hemorrhagic_disease.pdf Center for Food Security and Public Health]</ref>\n\nFrom China, RHDV1 spread westward and reached Europe in 1988. The virus has since appeared in Mexico, [[Cuba]], Australia, New Zealand, the United States and Canada.<ref name=Merck/> In 1992, the United Kingdom reported its first case of RHDV1 in domestic show rabbits. By the late 1990s, RHDV1 stretched to forty countries and had become [[endemic]] in [[Wild animal|wild]] and [[feral]] rabbit populations in Europe, Australia, New Zealand and [[Cuba]].<ref name=IAS/> In Europe, there was a rapid increase in research into RHD, due to the importance of the commercial breeding of rabbits for meat and fur production.\n\nThe first reported case of RHDV1 in the United States was in Iowa on March 9, 2000. The affected breeds included [[List of rabbit breeds|Palominos]] and [[Californian rabbit|California Whites]]. By April 6, 25 of the 27 affected rabbits had died of the infection. In order to contain the disease, the remaining two rabbits were euthanized. No new introductions of rabbits were placed on the farm for two years after the discovery of RHDV1 and August 1999 was the last time rabbits left and/or returned to the farm. The United States experienced other outbreaks of RHDV1 in 2001 ([[Utah]], [[Illinois]], [[New York (state)|New York]]) and 2005 ([[Indiana]]).<ref name=IAS/>\n\nIn 2010, a new virus variant called rabbit hemorrhagic disease virus 2 (RHDV2) emerged in France.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Le Gall-Recul\u00e9|first=Ghislaine|last2=Lavazza|first2=Antonio|last3=Marchandeau|first3=St\u00e9phane|last4=Bertagnoli|first4=St\u00e9phane|last5=Zwingelstein|first5=Fran\u00e7oise|last6=Cavadini|first6=Patrizia|last7=Martinelli|first7=Nicola|last8=Lombardi|first8=Guerino|last9=Gu\u00e9rin|first9=Jean-Luc|date=2013-09-08|title=Emergence of a new lagovirus related to rabbit haemorrhagic disease virus|journal=Veterinary Research|language=En|volume=44|issue=1|doi=10.1186/1297-9716-44-81|pmc=3848706|pmid=24011218|pages=81}}</ref> RHDV2 has since spread from France to the rest of Europe, Great Britain, Australia, and New Zealand. Outbreaks of RHDV2 started occurring in the United States and Vancouver Island Canada in 2019.

However, in late August it was confirmed that RHDV had been deliberately and illegally introduced to the [[Cromwell, New Zealand|Cromwell]] area of the [[South Island]].\n\nAn unsuccessful attempt was made by New Zealand officials to control the spread of the disease. It was, however, being intentionally spread, and several farmers (notably in the [[Mackenzie Basin]] area) admitted to processing rabbits that had died from the disease in kitchen blenders for further spreading.\n\nHad the disease been introduced at a better time, there would have been a more effective control of the population. However, it was released after breeding had commenced for the season, and rabbits under 2 weeks old at the time of the introduction were resistant to the disease.

Rabbits acquire RHD through oral, nasal or [[conjunctival]] pathways. Urine, feces and respiratory secretions may also shed the virus. The virus may also be carried by the wind. Carriers of the virus may remain infectious for up to a month depending on climate conditions; however, the virus has been known to persist for as little as 2 days and as long as 215 days. An infected carcass or hairs from an infected animal may also transmit RHD. Fomites such as clothing, contaminated food, cages, bedding, feeders and water will also harbour the virus. Even though the virus cannot reproduce in other mammals, predators and scavengers such as foxes, ferrets and some birds can excrete the virus through their faeces after ingesting an infected rabbit carcass. Flies, rabbit fleas, and mosquitoes can also spread the virus between rabbits.<ref name=IAS/>\n\nClimate appears to play a crucial role in the transmission of RHD. In normal conditions, most outbreaks of RHD occur in winter or spring. High temperatures in late spring and summer will considerably reduce the spread of the virus. RHD will also be more prevalent in dry and semi-dry areas than in areas that are relatively cool and humid.<ref name=strive/>\n\n== Signs ==\nRHD primarily infects only adult rabbits. In fact, research has shown that rabbits younger than 8 weeks of age are resistant to the virus. The incubation period for the RHD virus is between 1 and 3 days, with death following 1 to 2 days after the infection. There is a wide range of RHD symptoms. Most rabbits will show no signs of external symptoms of RHD.\n\nSymptomatic cases of RHD will display fever, squeals, and often coma leading to death within 12 to 36 hours. In less severe cases, rabbits may display uneasiness, excitement, [[Anorexia (symptom)|anorexia]], swollen eyelids, [[paralysis]], ocular [[haemorrhage]]s, and \"paddling\" or loss of skin. Convulsions may be seen as well. A fatal bloody discharge from the nose has been exhibited along with blood-stained cage floors, though these symptoms may have occurred after death. Rabbits who have recovered from the less severe symptoms usually develop severe [[jaundice]] with weight loss and [[lethargy]]. Diarrhoea, constipation and abdominal cramping are then exhibited right before death a few weeks later.<ref>?</ref>\n\nRHD causes rapid development of [[blood clot]] formation in major organs such as the heart, lungs and kidneys. The clots block blood vessels causing heart and respiratory failure. An infected rabbit that has died from RHD will often have its legs straight out and head over its neck.<ref name=strive/>\n\n== Diagnosis ==\nRHD may be indicated when several animals in the herd die after experiencing a fever and lethargy. [[Differential diagnosis]] includes [[pasteurellosis]], [[myxomatosis]], poisoning, heat exhaustion, and ''[[E. coli]]'' or ''[[Clostridium perfringens]]'' type E [[enterotoxemia]].\n\nRabbits that die from RHD are usually in good outward state. However, the most frequent post-mortem lesions are [[necrosis]] of the [[liver]], and [[splenomegaly]]. The liver of RHD rabbits may have a fine reticular pattern of necrosis outline each lobule and maybe yellow, gray or pale in colour. The liver is also usually [[friable]] and swollen. The spleen will be black in colour and also swollen with rounded edges, while the kidneys are dark brown in colour. [[Haemorrhages]] will also be seen many other organs and tissues. The trachea may present a foamy, bloody mucous. [[Enteritis]] of the small intestine and swollen [[meninges]] may also occur.\n\nLaboratory tests such as [[reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction]] (RT-PCR), [[Western blotting]], negative-staining immunoelectron microscopy, and [[ELISA]]s may be performed on samples from the liver, blood, spleen or other organs.\n\n== Morbidity, mortality, and immunity ==\nRHD is extremely hard to locate in the wild since about 75% of rabbits with RHD will die in their burrows underground. Due to this difficulty, the [[morbidity]] and [[Mortality rate|mortality]] estimates for RHD have a broad range. The morbidity rate ranges from 30% to 100% and the mortality rate from 40% to 100%; however, the typical mortality rate is usually around 90%.<ref name=IAS/>\n\nIn the wild, outbreaks in rabbits vary depending on the season, breeding cycles and geographical location. Some areas will see a high morbidity and mortality among its rabbit populations followed by calmer periods.\n\nMaternal antibodies such as [[immunoglobulin G]] (IgG), which are readily transmitted to the young across the placenta, may explain why very young rabbits are resistant to RHD. Some scientists also believe that the immature immune system of a young rabbit cannot produce the number of chemicals needed to initiate clotting in order to kill. Rabbits may develop immunity against other strains of the RHD virus, while others may endure persistent infections. The immunity does not survive through the next generation, leaving open the possibility of further outbreaks in the population.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Marques|first1=Raquel M|last2=Teixeira|first2=Luzia|last3=\u00c1guas|first3=Artur P|last4=Ribeiro|first4=Joana C|last5=Costa-e-Silva|first5=Ant\u00f3nio|last6=Ferreira|first6=Paula G|title=Immunosuppression abrogates resistance of young rabbits to Rabbit Haemorrhagic Disease (RHD)|journal=Veterinary Research|date=4 February 2014|volume=45|issue=1|doi=10.1186/1297-9716-45-14|pmc=3926702|pmid=24490832|pages=14}}</ref>\n\n== Control ==\nCountries that are uninfected by RHD may place restrictions on importation from endemic countries. According to the [[Merck & Co.|Merck]]/[[Merial]] Manual For Pet Health, Home Edition, 2007, RHD is a reportable disease in the United States. If a diagnosis is made by a veterinarian, a notification to the \"appropriate government authorities\" must be made.<ref name=IAS/>\n\nBecause of the highly infectious nature of the disease, strict quarantine is necessary when outbreaks occur. Depopulation, disinfection, surveillance and quarantines are the only way to properly and effectively eradicate the disease. Good disinfectants include 10% [[sodium hydroxide]], 1-2% [[formalin]], 2% One-Stroke Environ, and 10% household [[bleach]]. The RHD virus is resistant to [[ethers]] and [[chloroform]]. Deceased rabbits must be removed immediately and discarded in a safe manner. Surviving rabbits are quarantined or humanely euthanized.

The infectious agent responsible for the disease is '''rabbit haemorrhagic disease virus''' ('''RHDV'''), or '''rabbit calicivirus''' ('''RCV'''), genus ''[[Lagovirus]]'' of the family [[Caliciviridae]]. The virus infects only rabbits, and has been used in some countries to control rabbit populations.\n\n== RHDV1 and RHDV2 ==\n\nRabbit haemorrhagic disease virus (RHDV) is a single strand RNA virus in the genus Lagovirus and the family Caliciviridae. In the course of its evolution RHDV split into six distinct genotypes,<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Kerr |first1=P. J. |last2=Kitchen |first2=A. |last3=Holmes |first3=E.

RHDV1 (sometimes referred to simply as RHDV) only affects adult European rabbits (''Oryctolagus cuniculus''). This virus was first reported in China in 1984, from which it spread to much of Asia, Europe, Australia, and elsewhere. There have been a few isolated outbreaks of RHDV1 in the United States and Mexico, but they remained localized and were eradicated.\n\nRHDV2 first appeared in France in 2010, from which it spread to the rest of Europe, Great Britain, and Australia. This strain affects multiple lagomorph species, including ''Sylvilagus spp.'' (cottontail rabbits) and ''Lepus spp.'' (hares). It can also cause disease in young rabbits. RHDV2 appears to be replacing the RHDV1 strain in Australia. The 2019 and 2020 outbreaks of rabbit hemorrhagic disease in Washington state and Vancouver were caused by RHDV2. The 2020 outbreak of RHDV2 in Arizona, New Mexico, and Texas is affecting wild cottontails and hares as well as domestic European rabbits; since the virus has now spread into the wild rabbit populations, containment is unlikely.\n\nRHDV2 is distinct enough from RHDV1 that the two have different vaccines, which are only partially cross protective. Both viruses appear to spread via direct contact, fomites, biting insects (mechanical vectors only), and inhalation.\n\n== History ==\nRabbit hemorrhagic disease caused by RHDV1 first appeared in the Winter of 1983 in Jiangsu Province of the [[People's Republic of China]].

However, in late August it was confirmed that RHDV had been deliberately and illegally introduced to the [[Cromwell, New Zealand|Cromwell]] area of the [[South Island]].\n\nAn unsuccessful attempt was made by New Zealand officials to control the spread of the disease. It was, however, being intentionally spread, and several farmers (notably in the [[Mackenzie Basin]] area) admitted to processing rabbits that had died from the disease in kitchen blenders for further spreading.\n\nHad the disease been introduced at a better time, there would have been a more effective control of the population. However, it was released after breeding had commenced for the season, and rabbits under 2 weeks old at the time of the introduction were resistant to the disease. These young rabbits were therefore able to survive and breed rabbit numbers back up.

Rabbits acquire RHD through oral, nasal or [[conjunctival]] pathways. Urine, feces and respiratory secretions may also shed the virus. The virus may also be carried by the wind. Carriers of the virus may remain infectious for up to a month depending on climate conditions; however, the virus has been known to persist for as little as 2 days and as long as 215 days. An infected carcass or hairs from an infected animal may also transmit RHD. Fomites such as clothing, contaminated food, cages, bedding, feeders and water will also harbour the virus. Even though the virus cannot reproduce in other mammals, predators and scavengers such as foxes, ferrets and some birds can excrete the virus through their faeces after ingesting an infected rabbit carcass. Flies, rabbit fleas, and mosquitoes can also spread the virus between rabbits.<ref name=IAS/>\n\nClimate appears to play a crucial role in the transmission of RHD. In normal conditions, most outbreaks of RHD occur in winter or spring. High temperatures in late spring and summer will considerably reduce the spread of the virus. RHD will also be more prevalent in dry and semi-dry areas than in areas that are relatively cool and humid.<ref name=strive/>\n\n== Signs ==\nRHD primarily infects only adult rabbits. In fact, research has shown that rabbits younger than 8 weeks of age are resistant to the virus. The incubation period for the RHD virus is between 1 and 3 days, with death following 1 to 2 days after the infection. There is a wide range of RHD symptoms. Most rabbits will show no signs of external symptoms of RHD.\n\nSymptomatic cases of RHD will display fever, squeals, and often coma leading to death within 12 to 36 hours. In less severe cases, rabbits may display uneasiness, excitement, [[Anorexia (symptom)|anorexia]], swollen eyelids, [[paralysis]], ocular [[haemorrhage]]s, and \"paddling\" or loss of skin. Convulsions may be seen as well. A fatal bloody discharge from the nose has been exhibited along with blood-stained cage floors, though these symptoms may have occurred after death. Rabbits who have recovered from the less severe symptoms usually develop severe [[jaundice]] with weight loss and [[lethargy]]. Diarrhoea, constipation and abdominal cramping are then exhibited right before death a few weeks later.<ref>?</ref>\n\nRHD causes rapid development of [[blood clot]] formation in major organs such as the heart, lungs and kidneys. The clots block blood vessels causing heart and respiratory failure. An infected rabbit that has died from RHD will often have its legs straight out and head over its neck.<ref name=strive/>\n\n== Diagnosis ==\nRHD may be indicated when several animals in the herd die after experiencing a fever and lethargy. [[Differential diagnosis]] includes [[pasteurellosis]], [[myxomatosis]], poisoning, heat exhaustion, and ''[[E. coli]]'' or ''[[Clostridium perfringens]]'' type E [[enterotoxemia]].\n\nRabbits that die from RHD are usually in good outward state. However, the most frequent post-mortem lesions are [[necrosis]] of the [[liver]], and [[splenomegaly]]. The liver of RHD rabbits may have a fine reticular pattern of necrosis outline each lobule and maybe yellow, gray or pale in colour. The liver is also usually [[friable]] and swollen. The spleen will be black in colour and also swollen with rounded edges, while the kidneys are dark brown in colour. [[Haemorrhages]] will also be seen many other organs and tissues. The trachea may present a foamy, bloody mucous. [[Enteritis]] of the small intestine and swollen [[meninges]] may also occur.\n\nLaboratory tests such as [[reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction]] (RT-PCR), [[Western blotting]], negative-staining immunoelectron microscopy, and [[ELISA]]s may be performed on samples from the liver, blood, spleen or other organs.\n\n== Morbidity, mortality, and immunity ==\nRHD is extremely hard to locate in the wild since about 75% of rabbits with RHD will die in their burrows underground. Due to this difficulty, the [[morbidity]] and [[Mortality rate|mortality]] estimates for RHD have a broad range. The morbidity rate ranges from 30% to 100% and the mortality rate from 40% to 100%; however, the typical mortality rate is usually around 90%.<ref name=IAS/>\n\nIn the wild, outbreaks in rabbits vary depending on the season, breeding cycles and geographical location. Some areas will see a high morbidity and mortality among its rabbit populations followed by calmer periods.\n\nMaternal antibodies such as [[immunoglobulin G]] (IgG), which are readily transmitted to the young across the placenta, may explain why very young rabbits are resistant to RHD. Some scientists also believe that the immature immune system of a young rabbit cannot produce the number of chemicals needed to initiate clotting in order to kill. Rabbits may develop immunity against other strains of the RHD virus, while others may endure persistent infections. The immunity does not survive through the next generation, leaving open the possibility of further outbreaks in the population.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Marques|first1=Raquel M|last2=Teixeira|first2=Luzia|last3=\u00c1guas|first3=Artur P|last4=Ribeiro|first4=Joana C|last5=Costa-e-Silva|first5=Ant\u00f3nio|last6=Ferreira|first6=Paula G|title=Immunosuppression abrogates resistance of young rabbits to Rabbit Haemorrhagic Disease (RHD)|journal=Veterinary Research|date=4 February 2014|volume=45|issue=1|doi=10.1186/1297-9716-45-14|pmc=3926702|pmid=24490832|pages=14}}</ref>\n\n== Control ==\nCountries that are uninfected by RHD may place restrictions on importation from endemic countries. According to the [[Merck & Co.|Merck]]/[[Merial]] Manual For Pet Health, Home Edition, 2007, RHD is a reportable disease in the United States. If a diagnosis is made by a veterinarian, a notification to the \"appropriate government authorities\" must be made.<ref name=IAS/>\n\nBecause of the highly infectious nature of the disease, strict quarantine is necessary when outbreaks occur. Depopulation, disinfection, surveillance and quarantines are the only way to properly and effectively eradicate the disease. Good disinfectants include 10% [[sodium hydroxide]], 1-2% [[formalin]], 2% One-Stroke Environ, and 10% household [[bleach]]. The RHD virus is resistant to [[ethers]] and [[chloroform]]. Deceased rabbits must be removed immediately and discarded in a safe manner. Surviving rabbits are quarantined or humanely euthanized. Test rabbits may be used to monitor the virus on vaccinated farms.<ref name=\"IAS\" />\n\nThere are several vaccines available against VHD in the UK: Cylap, made by Fort Dodge Animal Health; Lapinject, made by CEVA Animal Health; Anivac, made by Animalcare Ltd and FILAVAC, made by Filavie.

[[Paul Burrell]] stated that Diana was still not over her break-up with Khan at the time of her death.<ref>Operation Paget Report, pp. 121-129</ref> It was also pointed out that Dodi and Diana had only met just under seven weeks before the accident, at Al-Fayed's villa in [[St. Tropez]] on 14 July, meaning there were only 47 days from their first meeting until the night of the accident.

While the couple had indeed visited the villa, the circumstances of the visit were exaggerated to say it had lasted two hours and that it was in the presence of a prominent Italian interior designer. A security guard at the villa, Reuben Murrell, felt uncomfortable lying about the matter and sold his story to ''The Sun'' stating that the visit lasted just under thirty minutes and was not in the company of any interior designer. He provided stills from CCTV to prove this and said he had been in the presence of Diana and Dodi for the entirety of their visit, with there having been no conversation about them coming to live at the villa.

The news said that because inside sources say that Diana and her boyfriend made love very often.\n\n==Absence of CCTV images==\nThe absence of [[Closed-circuit television|CCTV]] images showing the Mercedes's journey from the hotel to the crash site has been frequently cited as evidence of an organised conspiracy. According to ''[[The Independent]]'' newspaper in 2006, there were more than 14 CCTV cameras in the [[Pont de l'Alma]] underpass, though none recorded footage of the fatal collision.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/theroyalfamily/10250727/Princess-Dianas-death-the-conspiracy-theories.html|title=Princess Diana's death: the conspiracy theories|work=The Daily Telegraph|date=18 August 2013|accessdate=17 October 2016}}</ref>\n\nJudge Herv\u00e9 St\u00e9phan was appointed as Examining Magistrate in this case on 2 September 1997. On that day, by Judicial Order, he tasked the Brigade Criminelle with identifying all video and photographic images along the route taken by the Mercedes.  Lieutenant Eric Gigou of the Brigade Criminelle led the team that carried out that work, initially by retracing the route several times and drawing up a list of possible locations. His report showed that the team identified ten locations of CCTV cameras. None of these had any images relevant to the inquiry, since they were principally security cameras facing the entrances to buildings. Most of the cameras were not maintained by the City of Paris; the owners of the buildings to which they were attached operated them privately. There was a traffic-monitoring camera above the underpass in the Place de l'Alma itself but this was under the control of la Compagnie de Circulation Urbaine de Paris (Paris Urban Traffic Unit). That department closed down at about 11 p.m., had no night duty staff and made no recordings. Officers in the Police Headquarters Information and Command Centre could continue to view the pictures shown by the traffic camera in real time but could not control it. \n\nThe subject of the CCTV cameras is dealt with in Chapter 5 of the Operation Paget report. It was also found that a photograph that was published in a book by David Cohen ''Diana, Death of a Goddess'' and captioned as having been taken just before the car entered the tunnel was in fact taken by a photographer as the car left the back of the Paris Ritz.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://downloads.bbc.co.uk/news/nol/shared/bsp/hi/pdfs/14_12_06_diana_report.pdf|title=Operation Paget report|page=402}}</ref>\n\n==White Fiat Uno and James Andanson==\nAnalysis of the wreckage of the Mercedes revealed it had glancing contact with a white [[Fiat Uno]] car which left traces of paint on the Mercedes bodywork.

Al-Fayed further alleged that the Fiat Uno was owned by a French photojournalist named Jean-Paul James Andanson,<ref name=\"Stewart\"/> a security services agent according to Fayed,<ref name=\"Gregory\"/> who had photographed Diana while she was at his villa in St. Tropez in July 1997.

French police had examined Andanson's car as part of their effort to trace the one that had come into contact with the Mercedes with a view to prosecuting the driver for failing to render assistance and had reached the same conclusion. The French police spent a year after the accident searching for the vehicle and eliminated over 4,000 white Fiat Unos from their inquiry. Operation Paget decided it would be unlikely renewed enquiries would identify the vehicle involved as such a long period had elapsed since the accident. It concluded the threat of prosecution for a custodial offence probably deterred the driver from coming forward at the time.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://downloads.bbc.co.uk/news/nol/shared/bsp/hi/pdfs/14_12_06_diana_report.pdf|title=Operation Paget report|page=728}}</ref>\n\nA retired major in the French Brigade Criminelle, Jean Claude Mules, gave evidence to the inquest in February 2008. Andanson had been interviewed by French police in February 1998, and had been able to provide documentary evidence about his movements on the previous 30 and 31 August which had satisfied them that he could not have been the driver of the Fiat Uno involved. These demonstrated that Andanson could only have been at his home in Lignieres, 177 miles from Paris, at the time of the crash.<ref name=\"Stewart\"/> Elizabeth, his widow, said at the London inquest in February 2008 that her husband had been at home in bed with her at the time of the accident.<ref>{{cite news|last=Pavia|first=Will|url=http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/news/uk/article1917310.ece|title=James Andanson was \u2018at home on night of Diana crash\u2019|work=The Times|location=London|date=21 February 2008|accessdate=12 January 2016}} {{subscription required}}</ref>\n\n===Andanson's suicide===\nAndanson died in May 2000.

Andanson's death was attributed to problems in his private life.

Other eyewitness testimony made little reference to the appearance of any inexplicable flashes at the crash site. Several witnesses who would be expected to have seen a blinding flash made no reference to one. In any event, the detailed crash reconstruction revealed that the chain of events that led to the car unavoidably colliding with the pillar started well before it was at the mouth of the tunnel where the flash is alleged to have occurred. Furthermore, a strobe light of the type that was alleged to have been used is so powerful that a flash emitted from it would have been bright enough to illuminate a very wide area. It would have likely blinded not only Paul, but also the driver of the white Fiat Uno, the pursuing paparazzi and witnesses standing at the road side.

Police Officers S\u00e9bastien Dorzee and Lino Gagliadorne were the first emergency officials to arrive at the scene at around 12:30&nbsp;a.m.  Sergeants Xavier Gourmelom and Philippe Boyer of the Sapeurs-Pompiers arrived at around 12:32&nbsp;a.m. Doctor Jean-Marc Martino, a specialist in anaesthetics and intensive care treatment and the doctor in charge of the SAMU ambulance, arrived at around 12:40&nbsp;a.m. Diana was removed from the car at 1:00&nbsp;a.m.  She then went into cardiac arrest. Following external cardiopulmonary resuscitation, her heart started beating again. She was moved to the SAMU ambulance at 1:18&nbsp;a.m.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1YtUqz0xNY|title=\"Princess Diana - The Witnesses in the Tunnel\"|work=Britain's Channel 4|first=Christopher|last=Hitchens|date=June 2007|accessdate=26 March 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe ambulance departed the crash scene at 1:41&nbsp;a.m. and arrived at the hospital at 2:06&nbsp;a.m.&mdash;a journey time of approximately 26 minutes. This included a stop at the Gare d'Austerlitz ordered by Dr Martino because of the drop in the blood pressure of the Princess of Wales and the necessity to deal with it. The ambulance was travelling slowly on his express instructions. The doctor was concerned about Diana's blood pressure and the effects on her medical condition of deceleration and acceleration.\n\nThe SAMU ambulance carrying Diana passed the H\u00f4tel-Dieu Hospital on the Ile de la Cit\u00e9 en route to the Piti\u00e9-Salp\u00eatri\u00e8re Hospital. The decision to transfer her to the Piti\u00e9-Salp\u00eatri\u00e8re Hospital was taken by Dr Marc Lejay who was on despatch duty in SAMU Control on that night, in consultation with Dr Derossi, who was at the scene. The Piti\u00e9-Salp\u00eatri\u00e8re Hospital was the main reception centre for multiple trauma patients in Paris. The H\u00f4tel-Dieu was not equipped to deal with the injuries Diana had sustained. Lejay stated: \u2018The H\u00f4tel-Dieu hospital on the \u2018Ile de la Cit\u00e9\u2019 is closer but not equipped with heart surgery teams or neurosurgical teams or teams trained to take patients with multiple injuries.\u2019  Lejay was also aware that Professor Bruno Riou was on duty at the Piti\u00e9-Salp\u00eatri\u00e8re that night and was particularly skilled to treat her injuries.

Diana's body had been stored in an empty room adjacent to the emergency room where she had been treated at the [[Piti\u00e9-Salp\u00eatri\u00e8re Hospital]], as the mortuary was on the other side of the hospital grounds and some distance away.

President [[Jacques Chirac]] and his wife also wished to pay their respects. This meant there was very little time to prepare the body for viewing, and it was clearly unacceptable to present Diana's body to her family and the [[President of France]] in the state it was in. Faced with this situation, the hospital staff decided to press ahead with embalming with only verbal authority from Madame Martine Monteil, the local superintendent of police, who assured Jean Monceau \"that everything would be in order\". Under French law, paperwork must be completed before undertaking the embalming of any corpse likely to be subject to a post-mortem. This paperwork was completed, but only after the embalming had been carried out, giving rise to allegations of suspicious circumstances. The allegations were made despite there being no way the hospital staff could have known whether or not Diana was pregnant, as a pregnancy test would have been irrelevant to her post crash treatment and accordingly was not carried out.<ref>Operation Paget Report, Chapter Nine</ref>\n\n==SAS==\nThe Court Martial of [[Special Air Service|SAS]] Sniper [[Danny Nightingale (soldier)|Danny Nightingale]] led to a letter written by witness, Soldier N, and sent to his in-laws coming to wider attention.

This initial analysis was challenged by a British [[pathologist]] hired by Al-Fayed. In response, French authorities carried out a third test, this time using the more medically conclusive [[vitreous fluid]] from inside the eye, which confirmed the level of alcohol measured by blood and also showed Paul had been taking [[antidepressants]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2008/apr/08/diana.monarchy|title=Driver with a drinking problem and more comfortable in a Mini|publisher=The Guardian|date=8 April 2008}}</ref>\n\nIt has been claimed that the level of alcohol reported to have been found in Paul's blood was inconsistent with his sober demeanour, as captured on the [[Closed-circuit television|CCTV]] of the Ritz that evening.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/6162121.stm \"Q&A: What really happened\"], BBC News, 8 April 2008</ref> Professor Robert Forrest, a forensic pathologist, said that an alcoholic like Paul, with a higher tolerance for alcohol, would be able to appear more sober than he actually was.<ref>Martyn Gregory [https://books.google.com/books?id=vZPJjwm6ITMC&pg=PT122&lpg=PT122 ''Diana: The Last Days''], p.122</ref><ref>Clive Myrie [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/7335453.stm \"A tragic end to a day in Paris\"], BBC News, 7 April 2008</ref> The families of Dodi Fayed and Henri Paul did not accept the findings of the French investigation.\n\nIt was disclosed in November 2006 that Lord Stevens had met with Paul's elderly parents telling them that their son was not drunk.<ref name=\"Alderson\">Andrew Alderson [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1578182/Stevens-faces-grilling-over-Dianas-driver.html \"Stevens faces grilling over Diana's driver\"], telegraph.co.uk, 10 February 2008</ref> Just prior to Stevens's appearance at the inquest, a source close to Stevens stated that this inconsistency could be explained as him being \"considerate\" and \"sensitive\" towards the elderly couple,<ref name=\"Alderson\"/> an assessment Scott Baker suggested might be credible in his opening comments to the jury.<ref>Paul Cheston and Robert Jobson [https://www.standard.co.uk/news/stevens-must-explain-drunkuturn-6681801.html \"Stevens must explain 'drunk'U-turn\"], ''Evening Standard'', 3 October 2007</ref> Under cross-examination at the inquest in February 2008, Stevens denied \"deliberately misleading\" Paul's parents and said that the chauffeur's condition at the time of the crash did not match the police's definition of being drunk, which he said relied upon someone's physical responses.<ref name=\"ES0208\">[https://www.standard.co.uk/news/lord-stevens-demands-apology-for-al-fayed-allegations-that-he-failed-to-properly-investigate-dianas-death-7301258.html \"Lord Stevens demands apology for Al Fayed allegations 'that he failed to properly investigate Diana's death'\"], ''Evening Standard'', 15 February 2008</ref> Stevens said that the available evidence suggested Paul had consumed only two alcoholic drinks, but this was not necessarily all that Paul had consumed, and that he was indeed \"under the influence\" of alcohol at the time of the crash.<ref name=\"ES0208\"/> An expert cited in the report estimated that Paul had drunk the equivalent of five measures of Ricard, his favourite liquorice-flavoured French aperitif, before driving.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1576216/Dianas-driver-had-up-to-eight-drinks.html|title=Diana's driver had 'up to eight drinks'|work=The Telegraph|date=22 January 2008|accessdate=18 October 2016|last=Alleyne|first=Richard}}</ref>\n\nIn the two French TOXLAB tests, Paul was found to have 12.8% carbon haemoglobin saturation, a combination of blood's iron-carrying pigment and carbon monoxide.

On that day, by Judicial Order, he tasked the Brigade Criminelle with identifying all video and photographic images along the route taken by the Mercedes.  Lieutenant Eric Gigou of the Brigade Criminelle led the team that carried out that work, initially by retracing the route several times and drawing up a list of possible locations. His report showed that the team identified ten locations of CCTV cameras. None of these had any images relevant to the inquiry, since they were principally security cameras facing the entrances to buildings. Most of the cameras were not maintained by the City of Paris; the owners of the buildings to which they were attached operated them privately. There was a traffic-monitoring camera above the underpass in the Place de l'Alma itself but this was under the control of la Compagnie de Circulation Urbaine de Paris (Paris Urban Traffic Unit). That department closed down at about 11 p.m., had no night duty staff and made no recordings.

Al-Fayed further alleged that the Fiat Uno was owned by a French photojournalist named Jean-Paul James Andanson,<ref name=\"Stewart\"/> a security services agent according to Fayed,<ref name=\"Gregory\"/> who had photographed Diana while she was at his villa in St. Tropez in July 1997. Andanson's death in May 2000, Al-Fayed claimed, was either due to guilt over what he had done or because he was assassinated by the French or British security services to silence him.<ref name=\"PG1612\"/>\n\nOperation Paget found that the white Fiat Uno Andanson owned was in an unroadworthy condition, being nine years old at the time, with 325,000&nbsp;km on the [[odometer]]<ref name=\"Gregory129\">Martyn Gregory [https://books.google.com/books?id=vZPJjwm6ITMC&pg=PT129 ''Diana: The Last Days''], Random House, 2010, p.129</ref> (suggesting that the car had been driven 27,000 miles per annum) and had not been maintained for several years prior.

French police had examined Andanson's car as part of their effort to trace the one that had come into contact with the Mercedes with a view to prosecuting the driver for failing to render assistance and had reached the same conclusion. The French police spent a year after the accident searching for the vehicle and eliminated over 4,000 white Fiat Unos from their inquiry. Operation Paget decided it would be unlikely renewed enquiries would identify the vehicle involved as such a long period had elapsed since the accident. It concluded the threat of prosecution for a custodial offence probably deterred the driver from coming forward at the time.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://downloads.bbc.co.uk/news/nol/shared/bsp/hi/pdfs/14_12_06_diana_report.pdf|title=Operation Paget report|page=728}}</ref>\n\nA retired major in the French Brigade Criminelle, Jean Claude Mules, gave evidence to the inquest in February 2008. Andanson had been interviewed by French police in February 1998, and had been able to provide documentary evidence about his movements on the previous 30 and 31 August which had satisfied them that he could not have been the driver of the Fiat Uno involved. These demonstrated that Andanson could only have been at his home in Lignieres, 177 miles from Paris, at the time of the crash.<ref name=\"Stewart\"/> Elizabeth, his widow, said at the London inquest in February 2008 that her husband had been at home in bed with her at the time of the accident.<ref>{{cite news|last=Pavia|first=Will|url=http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/news/uk/article1917310.ece|title=James Andanson was \u2018at home on night of Diana crash\u2019|work=The Times|location=London|date=21 February 2008|accessdate=12 January 2016}} {{subscription required}}</ref>\n\n===Andanson's suicide===\nAndanson died in May 2000.

Other eyewitness testimony made little reference to the appearance of any inexplicable flashes at the crash site. Several witnesses who would be expected to have seen a blinding flash made no reference to one. In any event, the detailed crash reconstruction revealed that the chain of events that led to the car unavoidably colliding with the pillar started well before it was at the mouth of the tunnel where the flash is alleged to have occurred. Furthermore, a strobe light of the type that was alleged to have been used is so powerful that a flash emitted from it would have been bright enough to illuminate a very wide area. It would have likely blinded not only Paul, but also the driver of the white Fiat Uno, the pursuing paparazzi and witnesses standing at the road side.

The Piti\u00e9-Salp\u00eatri\u00e8re Hospital was the main reception centre for multiple trauma patients in Paris. The H\u00f4tel-Dieu was not equipped to deal with the injuries Diana had sustained.

Faced with this situation, the hospital staff decided to press ahead with embalming with only verbal authority from Madame Martine Monteil, the local superintendent of police, who assured Jean Monceau \"that everything would be in order\". Under French law, paperwork must be completed before undertaking the embalming of any corpse likely to be subject to a post-mortem. This paperwork was completed, but only after the embalming had been carried out, giving rise to allegations of suspicious circumstances.

In other words, if {{tt|o}} takes an argument, {{tt|-ofoo}} is the same as {{tt|-o foo}}.\n* Multiple options can be chained together, as long as the non-last ones are not argument taking. If {{tt|a, b}} takes no arguments while {{tt|e}} takes an optional argument, {{tt|-abe}} is the same as {{tt|-a -b -e}}, but {{tt|-bea}} is the same as {{tt|-b -e a}} due to the preceding rule.\n* All options precede non-option arguments (except for in the GNU extension). {{tt|--}} always marks the end of options.\n\n=== For programmers ===\nThe getopt manual from GNU specifies such a usage for getopt:<ref name=glibc>{{man|3|getopt|ManKier}}</ref>\n<source lang=c>\n#include <unistd.h>\n\nint getopt(int argc, char * const argv[],\n           const char *optstring);\n</source>\nHere the {{tt|argc}} and {{tt|argv}} are defined exactly like they are in the C {{tt|main}} function prototype, i.e. argc indicates the length of the argv array-of-strings. The {{tt|optstring}} contains a specification of what options to look for (normal alphanumerals except {{tt|W}}), and what options to accept arguments (colons). For example, {{tt|\"vf::o:\"}} refers to three options: an argumentless {{tt|v}}, an optional-argument {{tt|f}}, and a mandatory-argument {{tt|o}}. GNU here implements a {{tt|W}} extension for long option synonyms.<ref name=glibc/>\n\n{{tt|getopt}} itself returns an integer that is either an option character or -1 for end-of-options.<ref name=glibc/> The idiom is to use a while-loop to go through options, and to use a switch-case statement to pick and act on options. See the example section of this article.\n\nTo communicate extra information back to the program, a few global {{code|extern}} variables are referenced by the program to fetch information from {{code|getopt}}:\n<source lang=c>\nextern char *optarg;\nextern int optind, opterr, optopt;\n</source>\n; optarg: A string storing the argument to the current option, if present. Can be used to control where to start parsing (again).\n; optind: Where getopt is currently looking at in {{tt|argv}}.\n; opterr: A boolean switch controlling whether getopt should print error messages.\n; optopt: If an unrecognized option occurs, the value of that unrecognized character.\n\nThe GNU extension {{tt|getopt_long}} interface is similar, although it belongs to a different [[header file]] and takes an extra option for defining the \"short\" names of long options and some extra controls. If a short name is not defined, getopt will put an index referring to the option structure in the {{tt|longindex}} pointer instead.<ref name=glibc/>\n<source lang=c>\n#include <getopt.h>\n\nint getopt_long(int argc, char * const argv[],\n           const char *optstring,\n           const struct option *longopts, int *longindex);\n</source>\n\n== Examples ==\n\n=== Using POSIX standard ''getopt'' ===\n<source lang=\"c\">\n#include <stdio.h>     /* for printf */\n#include <stdlib.h>    /* for exit */\n#include <unistd.h>    /* for getopt */\nint main (int argc, char **argv) {\n    int c;\n    int digit_optind = 0;\n    int aopt = 0, bopt = 0;\n    char *copt = 0, *dopt = 0;\n    while ( (c = getopt(argc, argv, \"abc:d:012\")) != -1) {\n        int this_option_optind = optind ? optind : 1;\n        switch (c) {\n        case '0':\n        case '1':\n        case '2':\n            if (digit_optind != 0 && digit_optind != this_option_optind)\n              printf (\"digits occur in two different argv-elements.\\n\");\n            digit_optind = this_option_optind;\n            printf (\"option %c\\n\", c);\n            break;\n        case 'a':\n            printf (\"option a\\n\");\n            aopt = 1;\n            break;\n        case 'b':\n            printf (\"option b\\n\");\n            bopt = 1;\n            break;\n        case 'c':\n            printf (\"option c with value '%s'\\n\", optarg);\n            copt = optarg;\n            break;\n        case 'd':\n            printf (\"option d with value '%s'\\n\", optarg);\n            dopt = optarg;\n            break;\n        case '?':\n            break;\n        default:\n            printf (\"?? getopt returned character code 0%o ??\\n\", c);\n        }\n    }\n    if (optind < argc) {\n        printf (\"non-option ARGV-elements: \");\n        while (optind < argc)\n            printf (\"%s \", argv[optind++]);\n        printf (\"\\n\");\n    }\n    exit (0);\n}\n</source>\n\n=== Using GNU extension ''getopt_long'' ===\n<source lang=\"c\">\n#include <stdio.h>     /* for printf */\n#include <stdlib.h>    /* for exit */\n#include <getopt.h>    /* for getopt_long; POSIX standard getopt is in unistd.h */\nint main (int argc, char **argv) {\n    int c;\n    int digit_optind = 0;\n    int aopt = 0, bopt = 0;\n    char *copt = 0, *dopt = 0;\n    static struct option long_options[] = {\n    /*   NAME       ARGUMENT           FLAG  SHORTNAME */\n        {\"add\",     required_argument, NULL, 0},\n        {\"append\",  no_argument,       NULL, 0},\n        {\"delete\",  required_argument, NULL, 0},\n        {\"verbose\", no_argument,       NULL, 0},\n        {\"create\",  required_argument, NULL, 'c'},\n        {\"file\",    required_argument, NULL, 0},\n        {NULL,      0,                 NULL, 0}\n    };\n    int option_index = 0;\n    while ((c = getopt_long(argc, argv, \"abc:d:012\",\n                 long_options, &option_index)) != -1) {\n        int this_option_optind = optind ? optind : 1;\n        switch (c) {\n        case 0:\n            printf (\"option %s\", long_options[option_index].name);\n            if (optarg)\n                printf (\" with arg %s\", optarg);\n            printf (\"\\n\");\n            break;\n        case '0':\n        case '1':\n        case '2':\n            if (digit_optind != 0 && digit_optind != this_option_optind)\n              printf (\"digits occur in two different argv-elements.\\n\");\n            digit_optind = this_option_optind;\n            printf (\"option %c\\n\", c);\n            break;\n        case 'a':\n            printf (\"option a\\n\");\n            aopt = 1;\n            break;\n        case 'b':\n            printf (\"option b\\n\");\n            bopt = 1;\n            break;\n        case 'c':\n            printf (\"option c with value '%s'\\n\", optarg);\n            copt = optarg;\n            break;\n        case 'd':\n            printf (\"option d with value '%s'\\n\", optarg);\n            dopt = optarg;\n            break;\n        case '?':\n            break;\n        default:\n            printf (\"?? getopt returned character code 0%o ??\\n\", c);\n        }\n    }\n    if (optind < argc) {\n        printf (\"non-option ARGV-elements: \");\n        while (optind < argc)\n            printf (\"%s \", argv[optind++]);\n        printf (\"\\n\");\n    }\n    exit (0);\n}\n</source>\n\n==In Shell==\n{{main|getopts}}\nShell script programmers commonly want to provide a consistent way of providing options. To achieve this goal, they turn to getopts and seek to port it to their own language.\n\nThe first attempt at porting was the program ''getopt'', implemented by [[Unix System Laboratories]] (USL). This version was unable to deal with quoting and shell metacharacters, as it shows no attempts at quoting. It has been inherited to FreeBSD.<ref>{{man|1|getopt|FreeBSD}}</ref>\n\nIn 1986, USL decided that being unsafe around metacharacters and whitespace was no longer acceptable, and they created the builtin [[getopts]] command for Unix SVR3 Bourne Shell instead. The advantage of building the command into the shell is that it now has access to the shell's variables, so values could be written safely without quoting. It uses the shell's own variables to track the position of current and argument positions, {{tt|OPTIND}} and {{tt|OPTARG}}, and returns the option name in a shell variable.\n\nIn 1995, <code>getopts</code> was included in the [[Single UNIX Specification]] version 1 / [[X/Open]] Portability Guidelines Issue 4.<ref>{{cite web |title=getopts |url=https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/utilities/getopts.html |website=The Open Group (POSIX 2018)}}</ref> Now a part of the POSIX Shell standard, getopts have spread far and wide in many other shells trying to be POSIX-compliant.\n\n''getopt'' was basically forgotten until [[util-linux]] came out with an enhanced version that fixed all of old getopt's problems by escaping. It also supports GNU's long option names.<ref>{{man|1|getopt|Linux}}</ref> On the other hand, long options have been implemented rarely in the {{code|getopts}} command in other shells, [[ksh93]] being an exception.\n\n== In other languages ==\n''getopt'' is a consice description of the common POSIX command argument structure, and it is replicated widely by programmers seeking to provide a similar interface, both to themselves and to the user on the command-line.\n\n* C: non-POSIX systems do not ship {{code|getopt}} in the C library, but [[gnulib]]<ref name=\"gnulib\"/> and [[MinGW]] (both accept GNU-style), as well as some more minimal libraries, can be used to provide the functionality.<ref>{{cite web |title=visual studio - getopt.h: Compiling Linux C-Code in Windows |url=https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10404448 |website=Stack Overflow}}</ref>\n** The {{code|getopt}} interface has been criticized for being non-[[retranent]] with the global variables, so alternatives like {{code|popt}} has been written too.\n* D: The [[D programming language]] has a getopt module in the standard library.\n* [[Haskell (programming language)|Haskell]]: comes with System.Console.GetOpt, which is essentially a Haskell port of the GNU getopt library.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.haskell.org/haddock/libraries/System.Console.GetOpt.html|title=System.Console.GetOpt|publisher=}}</ref>\n* <!-- I might have this wrong, change if inaccurate. --> Java: There is no implementation of getopt in the Java standard library.

GNU here implements a {{tt|W}} extension for long option synonyms.<ref name=glibc/>\n\n{{tt|getopt}} itself returns an integer that is either an option character or -1 for end-of-options.<ref name=glibc/> The idiom is to use a while-loop to go through options, and to use a switch-case statement to pick and act on options. See the example section of this article.\n\nTo communicate extra information back to the program, a few global {{code|extern}} variables are referenced by the program to fetch information from {{code|getopt}}:\n<source lang=c>\nextern char *optarg;\nextern int optind, opterr, optopt;\n</source>\n; optarg: A string storing the argument to the current option, if present. Can be used to control where to start parsing (again).\n; optind: Where getopt is currently looking at in {{tt|argv}}.\n; opterr: A boolean switch controlling whether getopt should print error messages.\n; optopt: If an unrecognized option occurs, the value of that unrecognized character.\n\nThe GNU extension {{tt|getopt_long}} interface is similar, although it belongs to a different [[header file]] and takes an extra option for defining the \"short\" names of long options and some extra controls. If a short name is not defined, getopt will put an index referring to the option structure in the {{tt|longindex}} pointer instead.<ref name=glibc/>\n<source lang=c>\n#include <getopt.h>\n\nint getopt_long(int argc, char * const argv[],\n           const char *optstring,\n           const struct option *longopts, int *longindex);\n</source>\n\n== Examples ==\n\n=== Using POSIX standard ''getopt'' ===\n<source lang=\"c\">\n#include <stdio.h>     /* for printf */\n#include <stdlib.h>    /* for exit */\n#include <unistd.h>    /* for getopt */\nint main (int argc, char **argv) {\n    int c;\n    int digit_optind = 0;\n    int aopt = 0, bopt = 0;\n    char *copt = 0, *dopt = 0;\n    while ( (c = getopt(argc, argv, \"abc:d:012\")) != -1) {\n        int this_option_optind = optind ? optind : 1;\n        switch (c) {\n        case '0':\n        case '1':\n        case '2':\n            if (digit_optind != 0 && digit_optind != this_option_optind)\n              printf (\"digits occur in two different argv-elements.\\n\");\n            digit_optind = this_option_optind;\n            printf (\"option %c\\n\", c);\n            break;\n        case 'a':\n            printf (\"option a\\n\");\n            aopt = 1;\n            break;\n        case 'b':\n            printf (\"option b\\n\");\n            bopt = 1;\n            break;\n        case 'c':\n            printf (\"option c with value '%s'\\n\", optarg);\n            copt = optarg;\n            break;\n        case 'd':\n            printf (\"option d with value '%s'\\n\", optarg);\n            dopt = optarg;\n            break;\n        case '?':\n            break;\n        default:\n            printf (\"?? getopt returned character code 0%o ??\\n\", c);\n        }\n    }\n    if (optind < argc) {\n        printf (\"non-option ARGV-elements: \");\n        while (optind < argc)\n            printf (\"%s \", argv[optind++]);\n        printf (\"\\n\");\n    }\n    exit (0);\n}\n</source>\n\n=== Using GNU extension ''getopt_long'' ===\n<source lang=\"c\">\n#include <stdio.h>     /* for printf */\n#include <stdlib.h>    /* for exit */\n#include <getopt.h>    /* for getopt_long; POSIX standard getopt is in unistd.h */\nint main (int argc, char **argv) {\n    int c;\n    int digit_optind = 0;\n    int aopt = 0, bopt = 0;\n    char *copt = 0, *dopt = 0;\n    static struct option long_options[] = {\n    /*   NAME       ARGUMENT           FLAG  SHORTNAME */\n        {\"add\",     required_argument, NULL, 0},\n        {\"append\",  no_argument,       NULL, 0},\n        {\"delete\",  required_argument, NULL, 0},\n        {\"verbose\", no_argument,       NULL, 0},\n        {\"create\",  required_argument, NULL, 'c'},\n        {\"file\",    required_argument, NULL, 0},\n        {NULL,      0,                 NULL, 0}\n    };\n    int option_index = 0;\n    while ((c = getopt_long(argc, argv, \"abc:d:012\",\n                 long_options, &option_index)) != -1) {\n        int this_option_optind = optind ? optind : 1;\n        switch (c) {\n        case 0:\n            printf (\"option %s\", long_options[option_index].name);\n            if (optarg)\n                printf (\" with arg %s\", optarg);\n            printf (\"\\n\");\n            break;\n        case '0':\n        case '1':\n        case '2':\n            if (digit_optind != 0 && digit_optind != this_option_optind)\n              printf (\"digits occur in two different argv-elements.\\n\");\n            digit_optind = this_option_optind;\n            printf (\"option %c\\n\", c);\n            break;\n        case 'a':\n            printf (\"option a\\n\");\n            aopt = 1;\n            break;\n        case 'b':\n            printf (\"option b\\n\");\n            bopt = 1;\n            break;\n        case 'c':\n            printf (\"option c with value '%s'\\n\", optarg);\n            copt = optarg;\n            break;\n        case 'd':\n            printf (\"option d with value '%s'\\n\", optarg);\n            dopt = optarg;\n            break;\n        case '?':\n            break;\n        default:\n            printf (\"?? getopt returned character code 0%o ??\\n\", c);\n        }\n    }\n    if (optind < argc) {\n        printf (\"non-option ARGV-elements: \");\n        while (optind < argc)\n            printf (\"%s \", argv[optind++]);\n        printf (\"\\n\");\n    }\n    exit (0);\n}\n</source>\n\n==In Shell==\n{{main|getopts}}\nShell script programmers commonly want to provide a consistent way of providing options. To achieve this goal, they turn to getopts and seek to port it to their own language.\n\nThe first attempt at porting was the program ''getopt'', implemented by [[Unix System Laboratories]] (USL). This version was unable to deal with quoting and shell metacharacters, as it shows no attempts at quoting. It has been inherited to FreeBSD.<ref>{{man|1|getopt|FreeBSD}}</ref>\n\nIn 1986, USL decided that being unsafe around metacharacters and whitespace was no longer acceptable, and they created the builtin [[getopts]] command for Unix SVR3 Bourne Shell instead. The advantage of building the command into the shell is that it now has access to the shell's variables, so values could be written safely without quoting. It uses the shell's own variables to track the position of current and argument positions, {{tt|OPTIND}} and {{tt|OPTARG}}, and returns the option name in a shell variable.\n\nIn 1995, <code>getopts</code> was included in the [[Single UNIX Specification]] version 1 / [[X/Open]] Portability Guidelines Issue 4.<ref>{{cite web |title=getopts |url=https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/utilities/getopts.html |website=The Open Group (POSIX 2018)}}</ref> Now a part of the POSIX Shell standard, getopts have spread far and wide in many other shells trying to be POSIX-compliant.\n\n''getopt'' was basically forgotten until [[util-linux]] came out with an enhanced version that fixed all of old getopt's problems by escaping. It also supports GNU's long option names.<ref>{{man|1|getopt|Linux}}</ref> On the other hand, long options have been implemented rarely in the {{code|getopts}} command in other shells, [[ksh93]] being an exception.\n\n== In other languages ==\n''getopt'' is a consice description of the common POSIX command argument structure, and it is replicated widely by programmers seeking to provide a similar interface, both to themselves and to the user on the command-line.\n\n* D: The [[D programming language]] has a getopt module in the standard library.\n* [[Haskell (programming language)|Haskell]]: comes with System.Console.GetOpt, which is essentially a Haskell port of the GNU getopt library.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.haskell.org/haddock/libraries/System.Console.GetOpt.html|title=System.Console.GetOpt|publisher=}}</ref>\n* <!-- I might have this wrong, change if inaccurate. --> Java: There is no implementation of getopt in the Java standard library.

The history of sailing yachts begins in Europe in the beginning of the 1600s with the building of a pleasure vessel for the son of [[James VI and I|King James I of England]]. Pleasure vessels acquired the name ''yacht'' after the time of [[Charles II of England|Charles II]], who spent time exiled in Europe and visited the Netherlands, where a variety of yachts (''jaghts'' in Dutch) were already well-developed as pleasure boats for the elite classes since the beginning of the 17th century. Upon his restoration to the English crown, Charles commissioned a series of royal yachts, which included at least one experimental [[catamaran]]. The first recorded yacht race between two vessels occurred in 1661, followed by the first open sailing competition in 1663 in English waters.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|last=Herreshoff|first=L.

In Ireland, however, the gentry enjoyed yachting and founded the first yacht club in Cork as the Cork Harbor Water Club in 1720. English yacht racing continued among the English gentry who founded England's oldest yacht club in 1775 to support a fleet at [[Cumberland]]. With maritime peace, starting in 1815, came a resurgence of interest in yachting. Boatbuilders, who had been making fast vessels both for smugglers and the government [[Cutter (boat)|revenue cutters]], turned their skills again to yachts.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Evolution of design ===\n[[File:America's Cup Racing, 1893-Fred S. Cozzens-IMG 5974.JPG|thumb|1893 [[America's Cup]] match between ''[[Vigilant (yacht)|Vigilant]]'' and ''[[Valkyrie II]]'']]\nThe fast yachts of the early 19th century were typically [[lugger]]s, [[schooner]]s, or [[sloop]]s with [[fore-and-aft rig]]s. By the 1850s, yachts featured large sail areas, a narrow beam, and a deeper draft than was customary until then. Racing between yachts owned by wealthy patrons was common, with large wagers at stake. The [[America's Cup]] arose out of a contest between the yacht, ''[[America (yacht)|America]]'', and its English competitors. Both countries had rules by which to rate yachts, the English by tonnage and the American by length.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nEnglish and American design philosophies for sailing yachts diverged in the early 1800s: the English favoring a narrow [[Beam (nautical)|beam]] (width) and a deep-draft keel and the Americans favoring a broad beam and a shallow draft with a moveable centerboard to provide lateral resistance and righting moment. In 1851, when the yacht ''America'' crossed to England, the two design philosophies were converging back towards each other. ''America's'' pointed, convex bow and maximum beam, placed aft, influenced British designs, thanks to her racing successes against the British competition. American yachtsmen, in turn, found that their shallow \"skimming-dish\" designs weren't faster or safer than the visiting English yachts.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite book|last=Doane, Charles J.|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/551161085|title=The modern cruising sailboat : a complete guide to its design, construction, and outfitting|date=2010|publisher=International Marine|isbn=978-0-07-163700-8|location=Camden, Me.|oclc=551161085}}</ref>\n\nBy the turn of the 20th century, racing yachts featured long overhangs, fore and aft, and a narrow, deep keel by historic standards. Along the way, yacht designers discovered that handicapping rules based on tonnage or length were not good indicators of performance, although they remained a basis for taxation in the two home countries.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n=== Cruising yachts ===\n[[File:Spray.jpg|thumb|[[Joshua Slocum|Joshua Slocum's]] ''[[Spray (sailing vessel)|Spray]]'' in 1898]]\nThe prevalent purpose of yachting under sail in the 19th was racing. Boats would cross the Atlantic to engage the yachts of other owners in contests of speed. Cruising was the provenance of the most wealthy in large, luxurious yachts that had reliable auxiliary power or were solely steam-powered yachts.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nEarly explorers in smaller sailing craft wrote of their experiences cruising the lakes and canals of Europe in a sailing canoe ([[John MacGregor (sportsman)|John MacGregor]]) and the near-shore waters of England and Scotland in a {{Convert|20|ft|m|abbr=|adj=on}} [[Cutter (boat)|cutter]] (R.T. McMullen). In the late 1800s some cruising adventurers converted fishing vessels and pilot boats into cruising boats. The most note of these was [[Joshua Slocum|Joshua Slocum's]] ''[[Spray (sailing vessel)|Spray]]'', a converted work boat in which he accomplished the first single-handed circumnavigation (1895-98).<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nIn the 20th century, cruising yacht design evolved past the handicapping rules-based designs of the 19th century towards more sea-kindly hull designs. In the 1930s yacht hulls were designed with a \"fisherman\" underbody, whereby the slope of the bow continued to the fullest extent of the draft and then carried horizontally aft. Noted yacht designers, such as [[John Alden (naval architect)|John Alden]] and [[William Starling Burgess|Starling Burgess]] employed this configuration. Starting in the 1920s several new rating rules were devised by the [[Cruising Club of America]] and the [[Royal Ocean Racing Club]] in order to handicap yachts of different designs that were expected to compete against one another. Successful designers of this era were [[Olin Stephens]], [[Philip Rhodes]], Aage Nielson, and C. Raymond Hunt. The International Offshore Racing (IOR) rule supplanted the previous rules in 1970 to provide a fairer basis for handicapping racing yachts. This rule promoted the use of fin keels and blade rudders. This rule was augmented with the International Measurement System (IMS) to assure safe designs for extreme conditions, following the disastrous [[1979 Fastnet race|1979 Fastnet Race]] in which only 86 of the 303 participants finished owing to failed equipment and loss of 19 lives and five boats.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Technical Committee|first=Cruising Club of America|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/14377959|title=Desirable and undesirable characteristics of offshore yachts|date=1987|publisher=W.W.

The history of sailing yachts begins in Europe in the beginning of the 1600s with the building of a pleasure vessel for the son of [[James VI and I|King James I of England]]. Pleasure vessels acquired the name ''yacht'' after the time of [[Charles II of England|Charles II]], who spent time exiled in Europe and visited the Netherlands, where a variety of yachts (''jaghts'' in Dutch) were already well-developed as pleasure boats for the elite classes since the beginning of the 17th century. Upon his restoration to the English crown, Charles commissioned a series of royal yachts, which included at least one experimental [[catamaran]]. The first recorded yacht race between two vessels occurred in 1661, followed by the first open sailing competition in 1663 in English waters.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|last=Herreshoff|first=L.

In Ireland, however, the gentry enjoyed yachting and founded the first yacht club in Cork as the Cork Harbor Water Club in 1720. English yacht racing continued among the English gentry who founded England's oldest yacht club in 1775 to support a fleet at [[Cumberland]]. With maritime peace, starting in 1815, came a resurgence of interest in yachting. Boatbuilders, who had been making fast vessels both for smugglers and the government [[Cutter (boat)|revenue cutters]], turned their skills again to yachts.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Evolution of design ===\n[[File:America's Cup Racing, 1893-Fred S. Cozzens-IMG 5974.JPG|thumb|1893 [[America's Cup]] match between ''[[Vigilant (yacht)|Vigilant]]'' and ''[[Valkyrie II]]'']]\nThe fast yachts of the early 19th century were typically [[lugger]]s, [[schooner]]s, or [[sloop]]s with [[fore-and-aft rig]]s. By the 1850s, yachts featured large sail areas, a narrow beam, and a deeper draft than was customary until then. Racing between yachts owned by wealthy patrons was common, with large wagers at stake. The [[America's Cup]] arose out of a contest between the yacht, ''[[America (yacht)|America]]'', and its English competitors. Both countries had rules by which to rate yachts, the English by tonnage and the American by length.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nEnglish and American design philosophies for sailing yachts diverged in the early 1800s: the English favoring a narrow [[Beam (nautical)|beam]] (width) and a deep-draft keel and the Americans favoring a broad beam and a shallow draft with a moveable centerboard to provide lateral resistance and righting moment. In 1851, when the yacht ''America'' crossed to England, the two design philosophies were converging back towards each other. ''America's'' pointed, convex bow and maximum beam, placed aft, influenced British designs, thanks to her racing successes against the British competition. American yachtsmen, in turn, found that their shallow \"skimming-dish\" designs weren't faster or safer than the visiting English yachts.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite book|last=Doane, Charles J.|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/551161085|title=The modern cruising sailboat : a complete guide to its design, construction, and outfitting|date=2010|publisher=International Marine|isbn=978-0-07-163700-8|location=Camden, Me.|oclc=551161085}}</ref>\n\nBy the turn of the 20th century, racing yachts featured long overhangs, fore and aft, and a narrow, deep keel by historic standards. Along the way, yacht designers discovered that handicapping rules based on tonnage or length were not good indicators of performance, although they remained a basis for taxation in the two home countries.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n=== Cruising yachts ===\n[[File:Spray.jpg|thumb|[[Joshua Slocum|Joshua Slocum's]] ''[[Spray (sailing vessel)|Spray]]'' in 1898]]\nThe prevalent purpose of yachting under sail in the 19th was racing. Boats would cross the Atlantic to engage the yachts of other owners in contests of speed. Cruising was the provenance of the most wealthy in large, luxurious yachts that had reliable auxiliary power or were solely steam-powered yachts.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nEarly explorers in smaller sailing craft wrote of their experiences cruising the lakes and canals of Europe in a sailing canoe ([[John MacGregor (sportsman)|John MacGregor]]) and the near-shore waters of England and Scotland in a {{Convert|20|ft|m|abbr=|adj=on}} [[Cutter (boat)|cutter]] (R.T. McMullen). In the late 1800s some cruising adventurers converted fishing vessels and pilot boats into cruising boats. The most note of these was [[Joshua Slocum|Joshua Slocum's]] ''[[Spray (sailing vessel)|Spray]]'', a converted work boat in which he accomplished the first single-handed circumnavigation.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nIn the 20th century, cruising yacht design evolved past the handicapping rules-based designs of the 19th century towards more sea-kindly hull designs. In the 1930s yacht hulls were designed with a \"fisherman\" underbody, whereby the slope of the bow continued to the fullest extent of the draft and then carried horizontally aft. Noted yacht designers, such as [[John Alden (naval architect)|John Alden]] and [[William Starling Burgess|Starling Burgess]] employed this configuration. Starting in the 1920s several new rating rules were devised by the [[Cruising Club of America]] and the [[Royal Ocean Racing Club]] in order to handicap yachts of different designs that were expected to compete against one another. Successful designers of this era were [[Olin Stephens]], [[Philip Rhodes]], Aage Nielson, and C. Raymond Hunt. The International Offshore Racing (IOR) rule supplanted the previous rules in 1970 to provide a fairer basis for handicapping racing yachts. This rule promoted the use of fin keels and blade rudders. This rule was augmented with the International Measurement System (IMS) to assure safe designs for extreme conditions, following the disastrous [[1979 Fastnet race|1979 Fastnet Race]] in which only 86 of the 303 participants finished owing to failed equipment and loss of 19 lives and five boats.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Technical Committee|first=Cruising Club of America|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/14377959|title=Desirable and undesirable characteristics of offshore yachts|date=1987|publisher=W.W.

Often the abscess will start as an internal wound caused by ulceration, hard stool, or penetrative objects with insufficient lubrication.  This wound typically becomes infected as a result of the normal presence of feces in the rectal area, and then develops into an abscess.  This often presents itself as a lump of tissue near the [[anus]] which grows larger and more painful with time.  Like other abscesses, perianal abscesses may require prompt medical treatment, such as an incision and [[debridement]] or [[Lancing (surgical procedure)|lancing]].\n\n{{Anchor|Incisional abscess}}\n\n===Incisional abscess===\nAn ''incisional abscess'' is one that develops as a complication secondary to a [[surgical incision]].

The cytokines trigger an [[inflammation|inflammatory response]], which draws large numbers of [[white blood cell]]s to the area and increases the regional blood flow.\n\nThe final structure of the abscess is an abscess wall, or capsule, that is formed by the adjacent healthy cells in an attempt to keep the pus from infecting neighboring structures. However, such encapsulation tends to prevent immune cells from attacking bacteria in the pus, or from reaching the causative organism or foreign object.\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"180\">\nFile:Blausen 0007 Abscess.png|A diagram of an abscess\nfile:Pyemic abscesses of kidney.jpg|[[Pyaemia|Pyemic]] abscesses of [[kidney]]\n</gallery>\n\n==Diagnosis==\n[[File:UOTW 66 - Ultrasound of the Week 1.webm|thumb|Ultrasound showing an abscess of the skin<ref>{{cite web|title=UOTW #66 - Ultrasound of the Week|url=https://www.ultrasoundoftheweek.com/uotw-66/|website=Ultrasound of the Week|accessdate=27 May 2017|date=7 January 2016|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161102223449/http://www.ultrasoundoftheweek.com/uotw-66/|archivedate=2 November 2016}}</ref>]]\n\n[[File:Ultrasound image of breast 110323101432 1023060.jpg|Ultrasound image of breast abscess, appearing as a mushroom-shaped dark (hypoechoic) area|thumb]]\n\nAn abscess is a localized collection of pus (purulent inflammatory tissue) caused by suppuration buried in a tissue, an organ, or a confined space, lined by the pyogenic membrane.<ref>Robins/8th/68</ref> [[Ultrasound]] imaging in the emergency department can help in a diagnosis.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Barbic|first1=D|last2=Chenkin|first2=J|last3=Cho|first3=DD|last4=Jelic|first4=T|last5=Scheuermeyer|first5=FX|title=In patients presenting to the emergency department with skin and soft tissue infections what is the diagnostic accuracy of point-of-care ultrasonography for the diagnosis of abscess compared to the current standard of care?

The drainage of a lung abscess may be performed by positioning the patient in a way that enables the contents to be discharged via the [[respiratory tract]].  Warm compresses and elevation of the limb may be beneficial for a skin abscess.\n\n=== Antibiotics ===\nMost people who have an uncomplicated skin abscess should not use antibiotics.<ref name=\"ACEPfive\"/> Antibiotics in addition to standard incision and drainage is recommended in persons with severe abscesses, many sites of infection, rapid disease progression, the presence of [[cellulitis]], symptoms indicating bacterial illness throughout the body, or a health condition causing [[immunosuppression]].<ref name=NEJM2014/> People who are very young or very old may also need antibiotics.<ref name=NEJM2014/> If the abscess does not heal only with incision and drainage, or if the abscess is in a place that is difficult to drain such as the face, hands, or genitals, then antibiotics may be indicated.<ref name=NEJM2014/>\n\nIn those cases of abscess which do require antibiotic treatment, ''[[Staphylococcus aureus]]'' bacteria is a common cause and an anti-staphylococcus antibiotic such as [[flucloxacillin]] or [[dicloxacillin]] is used. The [[Infectious Diseases Society of America]] advises that the draining of an abscess is not enough to address community-acquired [[Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus|methicillin-resistant ''Staphylococcus aureus'']] (MRSA), and in those cases, traditional antibiotics may be ineffective.<ref name=NEJM2014/> Alternative antibiotics effective against community-acquired MRSA often include [[clindamycin]], [[doxycycline]], [[minocycline]], and [[trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole]].<ref name=NEJM2014/> The [[American College of Emergency Physicians]] advises that typical cases of abscess from MRSA get no benefit from having antibiotic treatment in addition to the standard treatment.<ref name=\"ACEPfive\"/> If the condition is thought to be [[cellulitis]] rather than abscess, consideration should be given to possibility of strep species as cause that are still sensitive to traditional anti-staphylococcus agents such as dicloxacillin or cephalexin in patients able to tolerate penicillin. [[Antibiotic]] therapy alone without surgical drainage of the abscess is seldom effective due to antibiotics often being unable to get into the abscess and their ineffectiveness at low [[pH]] levels.\n\n[[Cell culture|Culturing the wound]] is not needed if standard follow-up care can be provided after the incision and drainage.<ref name=\"ACEPfive\"/> Performing a wound culture is unnecessary because it rarely gives information which can be used to guide treatment.<ref name=\"ACEPfive\"/>\n\n===Packing===\nIn North America, after drainage, an abscess cavity is often packed, perhaps with cloth, in an attempt to protect the healing wound. However, evidence from emergency medicine literature reports that packing wounds after draining causes pain to the person and does not decrease the rate of recurrence, nor bring faster healing or fewer physician visits.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Bergstrom|first=KG|title=News, views, and reviews.

If foreign objects are not the cause, incising and draining the abscess is standard treatment.<ref name=\"ACEPfive\"/><ref>{{cite book |title=Surgery: Facts and Figures |last=Green |first=James |author2=Saj Wajed |year=2000 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn= 1-900151-96-0}}</ref>\n\nIn critical areas where surgery presents a high risk, it may be delayed or used as a last resort.  The drainage of a lung abscess may be performed by positioning the patient in a way that enables the contents to be discharged via the [[respiratory tract]].  Warm compresses and elevation of the limb may be beneficial for a skin abscess.\n\n=== Antibiotics ===\nMost people who have an uncomplicated skin abscess should not use antibiotics.<ref name=\"ACEPfive\"/> Antibiotics in addition to standard incision and drainage is recommended in persons with severe abscesses, many sites of infection, rapid disease progression, the presence of [[cellulitis]], symptoms indicating bacterial illness throughout the body, or a health condition causing [[immunosuppression]].<ref name=NEJM2014/> People who are very young or very old may also need antibiotics.<ref name=NEJM2014/> If the abscess does not heal only with incision and drainage, or if the abscess is in a place that is difficult to drain such as the face, hands, or genitals, then antibiotics may be indicated.<ref name=NEJM2014/>\n\nIn those cases of abscess which do require antibiotic treatment, ''[[Staphylococcus aureus]]'' bacteria is a common cause and an anti-staphylococcus antibiotic such as [[flucloxacillin]] or [[dicloxacillin]] is used. The [[Infectious Diseases Society of America]] advises that the draining of an abscess is not enough to address community-acquired [[Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus|methicillin-resistant ''Staphylococcus aureus'']] (MRSA), and in those cases, traditional antibiotics may be ineffective.<ref name=NEJM2014/> Alternative antibiotics effective against community-acquired MRSA often include [[clindamycin]], [[doxycycline]], [[minocycline]], and [[trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole]].<ref name=NEJM2014/> The [[American College of Emergency Physicians]] advises that typical cases of abscess from MRSA get no benefit from having antibiotic treatment in addition to the standard treatment.<ref name=\"ACEPfive\"/> If the condition is thought to be [[cellulitis]] rather than abscess, consideration should be given to possibility of strep species as cause that are still sensitive to traditional anti-staphylococcus agents such as dicloxacillin or cephalexin in patients able to tolerate penicillin. [[Antibiotic]] therapy alone without surgical drainage of the abscess is seldom effective due to antibiotics often being unable to get into the abscess and their ineffectiveness at low [[pH]] levels.\n\n[[Cell culture|Culturing the wound]] is not needed if standard follow-up care can be provided after the incision and drainage.<ref name=\"ACEPfive\"/> Performing a wound culture is unnecessary because it rarely gives information which can be used to guide treatment.<ref name=\"ACEPfive\"/>\n\n===Packing===\nIn North America, after drainage, an abscess cavity is often packed, perhaps with cloth, in an attempt to protect the healing wound. However, evidence from emergency medicine literature reports that packing wounds after draining causes pain to the person and does not decrease the rate of recurrence, nor bring faster healing or fewer physician visits.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Bergstrom|first=KG|title=News, views, and reviews.
