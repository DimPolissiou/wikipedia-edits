He founded the [[Mission San Xavier del Bac]] in 1700 about {{convert|7|mi|0|abbr=on}} upstream from the site of the settlement of Tucson. A separate Convento settlement was founded downstream along the Santa Cruz River, near the base of what is now known as [[Sentinel Peak (Arizona)|\"A\" mountain]]. [[Hugo Ocon\u00f3r|Hugo O'Conor]], the founding father of the city of Tucson, Arizona, authorized the construction of a military fort in that location, ''[[Presidio San Augustin del Tucson|Presidio San Agust\u00edn del Tucs\u00f3n]],'' on August 20, 1775 (the present downtown [[Pima County Courthouse]] was built near this site). During the Spanish period of the presidio, attacks such as the [[Second Battle of Tucson]] were repeatedly mounted by the [[Apache]]. Eventually the town came to be called ''Tucs\u00f3n,'' a Spanish version of the O'odham word for the area. It was included in the state of [[Sonora, Mexico|Sonora]] after [[Mexico]] gained independence from the [[Kingdom of Spain]] and its [[Spanish Empire]] in 1821.{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}}\n\nDuring the [[Mexican\u2013American War]] in 1846\u20131848, Tucs\u00f3n was [[capture of Tucson (1846)|captured]] by [[Philip St. George Cooke]] with the [[Mormon Battalion]], but it soon returned to Mexican control as Cooke proceeded to the west, establishing [[Cooke's Wagon Road]] to California. Tucs\u00f3n was not included in the [[Mexican Cession]] to the United States following the war. Cooke's road through Tucs\u00f3n became one of the important routes into California during the [[California Gold Rush]] of 1849.{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}}\n\nThe US acquired Arizona, south of the [[Gila River]], via treaty from Mexico in the [[Gadsden Purchase]] on June 8, 1854. Under this treaty and purchase, Tucs\u00f3n became a part of the United States of America. The American military did not formally take over control until March 1856. In time, the name of the town became standardized in English in its current form, where the stress is on the first syllable, the \"u\" is long, and the \"c\" is silent. \n\nIn 1857, Tucson was established as a stage station on the [[San Antonio-San Diego Mail Line]]. In 1858 it became 3rd division headquarters of the [[Butterfield Overland Mail]] and operated until the line was shut down in March 1861. The [[San Antonio-San Diego Mail Line|Overland Mail Corporation]] attempted to continue running; however, following the [[Bascom Affair]], devastating Apache attacks on the stations and coaches ended operations in August 1861.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}\n\nFrom August 1861 to mid-1862, Tucson served as the western capital of the [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] [[Arizona Territory (CSA)|Arizona Territory]], the eastern capital being [[Mesilla, New Mexico]]. In 1862, the [[California Column]] drove the Confederate forces out of Arizona. Tucson and all of what is now Arizona were included within the US [[New Mexico Territory]] until 1863, when they became part of the new [[Arizona Territory]].

The 6-member city council holds exclusive legislative authority, and shares executive authority with the mayor, who is elected by the voters independently of the council. An appointed city manager is responsible for the day-to-day operations of the city. Tucson is the only city in Arizona that holds officially partisan elections for city offices, with candidates being nominated through party primaries.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://ballot-access.org/2018/01/05/arizona-legislature/|title=Arizona Legislature {{!}} Ballot Access News|website=ballot-access.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-01-05|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180105212401/http://ballot-access.org/2018/01/05/arizona-legislature/|archive-date=January 5, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nBoth the council members and the mayor serve four-year terms; none face term limits. Council members are nominated by their wards via a ward-level primary held in August. The top vote-earners from each party then compete at-large for their ward's seat on the November ballot. In other words, on [[Election Day (politics)|election day]] the whole city votes on all the council races up for that year. Council elections are severed: Wards 1, 2, and 4 (as well as the mayor) are up for election in the same year (most recently 2015), while Wards 3, 5, and 6 share another year (most recently 2017).\n\nTucson is known for being a trailblazer in voluntary partial [[campaign finance|publicly financed campaigns]]. Since 1985, both mayoral and council candidates have been eligible to receive matching public funds from the city. To become eligible, council candidates must receive 200 donations of $10 or more (300 for a mayoral candidate). Candidates must then agree to spending limits equal to 33\u00a2 for every registered Tucson voter, or $79,222 in 2005 (the corresponding figures for mayor are 64\u00a2 per registered voter, or $142,271 in 2003). In return, candidates receive matching funds from the city at a 1:1 ratio of public money to private donations. The only other limitation is that candidates may not exceed 75% of the limit by the date of the primary. Many cities, such as San Francisco and New York City, have copied this system, albeit with more complex spending and matching formulas.\n\nMayor [[Regina Romero]] (D) was sworn into office on December 2, 2019, succeeding [[Jonathan Rothschild]] (D) who was sworn into office on December 5, 2011, succeeding [[Robert E.

A separate Convento settlement was founded downstream along the Santa Cruz River, near the base of what is now known as [[Sentinel Peak (Arizona)|\"A\" mountain]].

During the Spanish period of the presidio, attacks such as the [[Second Battle of Tucson]] were repeatedly mounted by the [[Apache]]. Eventually the town came to be called ''Tucs\u00f3n,'' a Spanish version of the O'odham word for the area.

The 6-member city council holds exclusive legislative authority, and shares executive authority with the mayor, who is elected by the voters independently of the council. An appointed city manager is responsible for the day-to-day operations of the city. Tucson is the only city in Arizona that holds officially partisan elections for city offices, with candidates being nominated through party primaries.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://ballot-access.org/2018/01/05/arizona-legislature/|title=Arizona Legislature {{!}} Ballot Access News|website=ballot-access.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-01-05|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180105212401/http://ballot-access.org/2018/01/05/arizona-legislature/|archive-date=January 5, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nBoth the council members and the mayor serve four-year terms; none face term limits. Council members are nominated by their wards via a ward-level primary held in August. The top vote-earners from each party then compete at-large for their ward's seat on the November ballot. In other words, on [[Election Day (politics)|election day]] the whole city votes on all the council races up for that year. Council elections are severed: Wards 1, 2, and 4 (as well as the mayor) are up for election in the same year (most recently 2015), while Wards 3, 5, and 6 share another year (most recently 2017).\n\nTucson is known for being a trailblazer in voluntary partial [[campaign finance|publicly financed campaigns]]. Since 1985, both mayoral and council candidates have been eligible to receive matching public funds from the city. To become eligible, council candidates must receive 200 donations of $10 or more (300 for a mayoral candidate). Candidates must then agree to spending limits equal to 33\u00a2 for every registered Tucson voter, or $79,222 in 2005 (the corresponding figures for mayor are 64\u00a2 per registered voter, or $142,271 in 2003). In return, candidates receive matching funds from the city at a 1:1 ratio of public money to private donations. The only other limitation is that candidates may not exceed 75% of the limit by the date of the primary. Many cities, such as San Francisco and New York City, have copied this system, albeit with more complex spending and matching formulas.\n\nMayor [[Regina Romero]] (D) was sworn into office on December 2, 2019, succeeding [[Jonathan Rothschild]] (D) who was sworn into office on December 5, 2011, succeeding [[Robert E.
