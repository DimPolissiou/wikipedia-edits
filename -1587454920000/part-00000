After the war the economy began to improve, before the [[financial crisis of 2007\u201308]] the Croatian economy grew at 4-5% annually, incomes doubled, and economic and social opportunities dramatically improved.\n\nThe Croatian economy is one of the strongest economies in [[Southeast Europe]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.hr-eu.net/article.php?lang=2&id=31&t=Economic%20transition|title=Economic transition|website=www.hr-eu.net|access-date=2019-11-19}}</ref> Croatia joined the [[World Trade Organization]] in 2000, [[NATO]] in 2009 and became a member of the [[European Union]] on 1 July 2013. Croatian economy was badly affected by the financial crisis which, together with slow progress of economic reforms, resulted in six years of recession and a cumulative decline in GDP of 12.5%.\nCroatia formally emerged from the recession in the 4th quarter of 2014, and had a continuous GDP growth since. Croatian economy reached pre \n[[Financial crisis of 2007\u201308|crisis]] levels in 2019 but due to [[Coronavirus disease 2019|Coronavirus disease]] the economy is set to contract more than -9,0% during first and second quarter of 2020, however growth is set to pick up in third quarter of 2020.\n\nThe [[Industry of Croatia|industrial sector]] with exports of over \u20ac10 billion annually is dominated by shipbuilding which accounts for over 10% of exported goods. Food processing and chemical industry also account for significant portions of industrial output and exports. Industrial sector represents 27% of Croatia's total economic output while agriculture represents 6%. Industrial sector is responsible for 25% of Croatia's GDP, with agriculture, forestry and fishing accounting for the remaining 5% of Croatian GDP.\n\n[[Tourism]] is traditionally a notable source of income, particularly during the summer months, but also more recently during the winter months as well, due to an increase in popularity of snow sports such as [[skiing]]. With over 14 million tourists annually, tourism generates revenue in excess of \u20ac8 billion.

Many industrial branches developed in that time, like forestry and wood industry ([[stave (wood)|stave]] fabrication, the production of potash, lumber mills, shipbuilding). The most profitable one was stave fabrication, the boom of which started in the 1820s with the clearing of the oak forests around [[Karlovac]] and [[Sisak]] and again in the 1850s with the marshy oak masses along the Sava and Drava rivers. Shipbuilding in Croatia played a huge role in the 1850s [[Austrian Empire]], especially the longe-range sailing boats.

Economy was still traditionally based on agriculture and raising of livestock, with peasants accounting for more than half of Croatia's population.<ref name=Frucht /><ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=-84_kkgMf2QC The ''First Yugoslavia: Search for a Viable Political System''], Hoover Press, 1983, p. 72</ref>\n\nIn 1941 the [[Independent State of Croatia]] (NDH), a [[World War II]] [[puppet state]] of [[Nazi Germany|Germany]] and [[Kingdom of Italy|Italy]], was established in parts of [[World War II in Yugoslavia|Axis-occupied Yugoslavia]].

Its currency was the [[Independent State of Croatia kuna|NDH kuna]]. The Croatian State Bank was the central bank, responsible for issuing currency.

By 1948 almost all domestic and foreign-owned capital had been nationalized. The industrialization plan relied on high taxation, fixed prices, [[World War II reparations towards Yugoslavia|war reparations]], Soviet credits, and export of food and raw materials. Forced collectivization of agriculture was initiated in 1949. At that time 94% of agricultural land was privately owned, and by 1950 96% was under the control of the social sector. A rapid improvement of food production and the standard of living was expected, but due to bad results the program was abandoned three years later.<ref name=Frucht />\n\nThroughout the 1950s Croatia experienced rapid urbanization. [[Decentralization]] came in 1965 and spurred growth of several sectors including the prosperous [[Tourism in Croatia|tourist industry]]. [[SR Croatia]] was, after [[SR Slovenia]], the second most developed republic in Yugoslavia with a 25% higher GDP per capita than the Yugoslav average. Croatia and Slovenia accounted for nearly half of the total Yugoslav GDP, and this was reflected in the overall [[standard of living]]. In the mid-1960s, Yugoslavia lifted emigration restrictions and the number of emigrants increased rapidly. In 1971 224,722 workers from Croatia were employed abroad, mostly in [[West Germany]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.photius.com/countries/croatia/society/yugoslavia_former_society_guest_workers.html|title=Yugoslavia (former)  Guest Workers \u2013 Flags, Maps, Economy, History, Climate, Natural Resources, Current Issues, International Agreements, Population, Social Statistics, Political System|website=www.photius.com}}</ref><ref>Ivo Neja\u0161mi\u0107: [http://hrcak.srce.hr/index.php?show=clanak&id_clanak_jezik=187703 Hrvatski gra\u0111ani na radu u inozemstvu: razmatranje popisnih podataka 1971, 1981. i 1991.]</ref> Foreign remittances contributed $2 billion annually to the economy by 1990.<ref>Europa Publications Limited.

Privatization under the new government had barely begun when war broke out in 1991. As a result of the [[Croatian War of Independence]], infrastructure sustained massive damage in the period 1991\u201392, especially the revenue-rich tourism industry. [[Privatization in Croatia]] and transformation from a planned economy to a [[market economy]] was thus slow and unsteady, largely as a result of public mistrust when many state-owned companies were sold to politically well-connected at below-market prices. With the end of the war, Croatia's economy recovered moderately, but corruption, cronyism, and a general lack of transparency stymied economic reforms and foreign investment.<ref name=IBP /><ref name=Benczes>Istvan Benczes: [https://books.google.com/books?id=f4R2BgAAQBAJ Deficit and Debt in Transition: The Political Economy of Public Finances in Central and Eastern Europe], Central European University Press, 2014, p. 203</ref> The privatization of large government-owned companies was practically halted during the war and in the years immediately following the conclusion of peace.

In 1991 the [[Croatian dinar]] was introduced as a transitional currency, but inflation continued to accelerate. The anti-inflationary stabilization steps in 1993 decreased retail price inflation from a monthly rate of 38,7% to 1,4%, and by the end of the year Croatia experienced deflation. In 1994 Croatia introduced the [[Croatian kuna|kuna]] as its currency.<ref name=Benczes />\n\nAs a result of the macro-stabilization programs, the negative growth of GDP during the early 1990s stopped and turned into a positive trend. Post-war reconstruction activity provided another impetus to growth. Consumer spending and private sector investments, both of which were postponed during the war, contributed to the growth in 1995\u20131997.<ref name=Benczes /> Croatia began its independence with a relatively low external debt because the debt of Yugoslavia was not shared among its former republics at the beginning. In March 1995 Croatia agreed with the Paris Club of creditor governments and took 28,5% of Yugoslavia's previously non-allocated debt over 14 years. In July 1996 an agreement was reached with the London Club of commercial creditors, when Croatia took 29,5% of Yugoslavia's debt to commercial banks. In 1997 around 60 percent of Croatia's external debt was inherited from former Yugoslavia.<ref name=Benczes2>Istvan Benczes: [https://books.google.com/books?id=f4R2BgAAQBAJ Deficit and Debt in Transition: The Political Economy of Public Finances in Central and Eastern Europe], Central European University Press, 2014, p. 205-206</ref>\n\nAt the beginning of 1998 value-added tax was introduced.

After the collapse of [[socialism]], [[Croatia]] went through a process of transition to a [[Market economy|market-based economy]] in the 1990s, but its economy suffered badly during the [[Croatian War of Independence]]. After the war the economy began to improve, before the [[financial crisis of 2007\u201308]] the Croatian economy grew at 4-5% annually, incomes doubled, and economic and social opportunities dramatically improved.\n\nThe Croatian economy is one of the strongest economies in [[Southeast Europe]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.hr-eu.net/article.php?lang=2&id=31&t=Economic%20transition|title=Economic transition|website=www.hr-eu.net|access-date=2019-11-19}}</ref> Croatia joined the [[World Trade Organization]] in 2000, [[NATO]] in 2009 and became a member of the [[European Union]] on 1 July 2013. Croatian economy was badly affected by the financial crisis which, together with slow progress of economic reforms, resulted in six years of recession and a cumulative decline in GDP of 12.5%.\nCroatia formally emerged from the recession in the 4th quarter of 2014, and had a continuous GDP growth since. Croatian economy reached pre \n[[Financial crisis of 2007\u201308|crisis]] levels in 2019 but due to [[Coronavirus disease 2019|Coronavirus disease]] the economy is set to contract more than -9,0% during first and second quarter of 2020, however growth is set to pick up in third quarter of 2020.\n\nThe [[Industry of Croatia|industrial sector]] with exports of over \u20ac10 billion annually is dominated by shipbuilding which accounts for over 10% of exported goods. Food processing and chemical industry also account for significant portions of industrial output and exports. Industrial sector represents 27% of Croatia's total economic output while agriculture represents 6%. Industrial sector is responsible for 25% of Croatia's GDP, with agriculture, forestry and fishing accounting for the remaining 5% of Croatian GDP.\n\n[[Tourism]] is traditionally a notable source of income, particularly during the summer months, but also more recently during the winter months as well, due to an increase in popularity of snow sports such as [[skiing]]. With over 14 million tourists annually, tourism generates revenue in excess of \u20ac8 billion. Croatia is ranked among the top 20 most popular tourist destinations in the world, and was voted world's top tourism destination in 2005 by [[Lonely Planet]].<ref name=Lonely_Planet>{{cite web|url=http://www.lonelyplanet.com/columns/index.htm |title=Top Destinations for 2005|url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080308064100/http://www.lonelyplanet.com/columns/index.htm |archivedate=8 March 2008|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nTrade plays a major role in Croatian economic output. In 2007 Croatia's exports were valued at US$12.84 billion (24.7 billion including service exports). According to Healy Consultants, trade in Croatia is bolstered by its low trade-weighted average tariff of just 1.2%.<ref>{{cite web|title=Advantages of Croatia Company Registration |url=http://www.healyconsultants.com/croatia-company-registration/|publisher=Healy Consultants|accessdate=5 February 2015}}</ref> Croatia's currency is the [[Croatian kuna|kuna]], which was implemented in 1994 and has remained stable since.\n\n==History==\n\n===Pre\u20131990===\n[[File:Viktor Kova\u010di\u0107- Pala\u010da Burze, Trg Burze, Zagreb, 1922- 1927.jpg|thumb|left|[[Zagreb]] [[Zagreb Stock Exchange|Stock Exchange Palace]] in 1927]]\n[[File:Rijeka oil refinery around 1930.jpg|thumb|left|[[Oil refinery]] in [[Rijeka]] in the 1930s]]\nDuring the 19th century the [[Kingdom of Croatia (Habsburg)|Kingdom of Croatia]] had a high ratio of population working in agriculture. Many industrial branches developed in that time, like forestry and wood industry ([[stave (wood)|stave]] fabrication, the production of potash, lumber mills, shipbuilding). The most profitable one was stave fabrication, the boom of which started in the 1820s with the clearing of the oak forests around [[Karlovac]] and [[Sisak]] and again in the 1850s with the marshy oak masses along the Sava and Drava rivers. Shipbuilding in Croatia played a huge role in the 1850s [[Austrian Empire]], especially the longe-range sailing boats. Sisak and [[Vukovar]] were the centres of river-shipbuilding.<ref>[http://hrcak.srce.hr/81678 Mariann Nagy \u2013 Croatia in the Economic Structure of the Habsburg Empire in the Light of the 1857 Census], p. 81-82</ref> [[Kingdom of Slavonia|Slavonia]] was also mostly an agricultural land and it was known for its silk production.

According to estimates, roughly 400,000 Croats emigrated from Austria-Hungary between 1880 and 1914. In 1910 8,5% of the population of [[Kingdom of Croatia-Slavonia|Croatia-Slavonia]] lived in urban settlements.<ref name=Frucht>[https://books.google.com/books?id=lVBB1a0rC70C Richard C.

Most of its industry was based in Slovenia and Croatia, but further industrial development was modest and centered on textile mills, sawmills, brick yards and food-processing plants. Economy was still traditionally based on agriculture and raising of livestock, with peasants accounting for more than half of Croatia's population.<ref name=Frucht /><ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=-84_kkgMf2QC The ''First Yugoslavia: Search for a Viable Political System''], Hoover Press, 1983, p. 72</ref>\n\nIn 1941 the [[Independent State of Croatia]] (NDH), a [[World War II]] [[puppet state]] of [[Nazi Germany|Germany]] and [[Kingdom of Italy|Italy]], was established in parts of [[World War II in Yugoslavia|Axis-occupied Yugoslavia]].

The fulfillment of basic economic interests was primarily ensured with measures of repression.<ref name=Matkovic>[[Hrvoje Matkovi\u0107]]: Povijest nezavisne dr\u017eave Hrvatske, Drugo, dopunjeno izdanje Zagreb, 2002., p. 118</ref> All large companies were placed under state control and the property of the regime's national enemies was nationalized. Its currency was the [[Independent State of Croatia kuna|NDH kuna]]. The Croatian State Bank was the central bank, responsible for issuing currency. As the war progressed the government kept printing more money and its amount in circulation was rapidly increasing, resulting in high inflation rates.<ref>Jozo Toma\u0161evi\u0107: Rat i revolucija u Jugoslaviji 1941\u20131945, 2010, p. 785</ref>\n\nAfter the World War II, the new [[Communist Party of Yugoslavia]] resorted to a command economy on the Soviet model of rapid industrial development. By 1948 almost all domestic and foreign-owned capital had been nationalized. The industrialization plan relied on high taxation, fixed prices, [[World War II reparations towards Yugoslavia|war reparations]], Soviet credits, and export of food and raw materials. Forced collectivization of agriculture was initiated in 1949. At that time 94% of agricultural land was privately owned, and by 1950 96% was under the control of the social sector. A rapid improvement of food production and the standard of living was expected, but due to bad results the program was abandoned three years later.<ref name=Frucht />\n\nThroughout the 1950s Croatia experienced rapid urbanization. [[Decentralization]] came in 1965 and spurred growth of several sectors including the prosperous [[Tourism in Croatia|tourist industry]]. [[SR Croatia]] was, after [[SR Slovenia]], the second most developed republic in Yugoslavia with a 25% higher GDP per capita than the Yugoslav average. Croatia and Slovenia accounted for nearly half of the total Yugoslav GDP, and this was reflected in the overall [[standard of living]]. In the mid-1960s, Yugoslavia lifted emigration restrictions and the number of emigrants increased rapidly. In 1971 224,722 workers from Croatia were employed abroad, mostly in [[West Germany]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.photius.com/countries/croatia/society/yugoslavia_former_society_guest_workers.html|title=Yugoslavia (former)  Guest Workers \u2013 Flags, Maps, Economy, History, Climate, Natural Resources, Current Issues, International Agreements, Population, Social Statistics, Political System|website=www.photius.com}}</ref><ref>Ivo Neja\u0161mi\u0107: [http://hrcak.srce.hr/index.php?show=clanak&id_clanak_jezik=187703 Hrvatski gra\u0111ani na radu u inozemstvu: razmatranje popisnih podataka 1971, 1981. i 1991.]</ref> Foreign remittances contributed $2 billion annually to the economy by 1990.<ref>Europa Publications Limited.

Privatization under the new government had barely begun when war broke out in 1991. As a result of the [[Croatian War of Independence]], infrastructure sustained massive damage in the period 1991\u201392, especially the revenue-rich tourism industry. [[Privatization in Croatia]] and transformation from a planned economy to a [[market economy]] was thus slow and unsteady, largely as a result of public mistrust when many state-owned companies were sold to politically well-connected at below-market prices. With the end of the war, Croatia's economy recovered moderately, but corruption, cronyism, and a general lack of transparency stymied economic reforms and foreign investment.<ref name=IBP /><ref name=Benczes>Istvan Benczes: [https://books.google.com/books?id=f4R2BgAAQBAJ Deficit and Debt in Transition: The Political Economy of Public Finances in Central and Eastern Europe], Central European University Press, 2014, p. 203</ref> The privatization of large government-owned companies was practically halted during the war and in the years immediately following the conclusion of peace. As of 2000, roughly 70% of Croatia's major companies were still state-owned, including water, electricity, oil, transportation, telecommunications, and tourism.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=lVBB1a0rC70C Eastern Europe: An Introduction to the People, Land, and Culture], p. 473</ref>\n\nEarly 1990s were characterized with high inflation rates. In 1991 the [[Croatian dinar]] was introduced as a transitional currency, but inflation continued to accelerate. The anti-inflationary stabilization steps in 1993 decreased retail price inflation from a monthly rate of 38,7% to 1,4%, and by the end of the year Croatia experienced deflation. In 1994 Croatia introduced the [[Croatian kuna|kuna]] as its currency.<ref name=Benczes />\n\nAs a result of the macro-stabilization programs, the negative growth of GDP during the early 1990s stopped and turned into a positive trend. Post-war reconstruction activity provided another impetus to growth. Consumer spending and private sector investments, both of which were postponed during the war, contributed to the growth in 1995\u20131997.<ref name=Benczes /> Croatia began its independence with a relatively low external debt because the debt of Yugoslavia was not shared among its former republics at the beginning. In March 1995 Croatia agreed with the Paris Club of creditor governments and took 28,5% of Yugoslavia's previously non-allocated debt over 14 years. In July 1996 an agreement was reached with the London Club of commercial creditors, when Croatia took 29,5% of Yugoslavia's debt to commercial banks. In 1997 around 60 percent of Croatia's external debt was inherited from former Yugoslavia.<ref name=Benczes2>Istvan Benczes: [https://books.google.com/books?id=f4R2BgAAQBAJ Deficit and Debt in Transition: The Political Economy of Public Finances in Central and Eastern Europe], Central European University Press, 2014, p. 205-206</ref>\n\nAt the beginning of 1998 value-added tax was introduced.

According to the [[Royal Spanish Academy]], \"espa\u00f1ol\" (Spanish) derives from the [[Proven\u00e7al dialect|Proven\u00e7al]] word ''espaignol'' and that, in turn, derives from the [[Medieval Latin]] word ''Hispaniolus'', which means \"from \u2014or pertaining to\u2014 [[Hispania]]\". The Latin form {{smallcaps|<small>H\u012cSP\u0100N\u012cOLUS</small>}} comes from the Latin name of the province of [[Hispania|<small>H\u012cSP\u0100N\u012cA</small>]] that included the current territory of the [[Iberian Peninsula]]. In late Latin, the /<small>H</small>/ was silent and /<small>\u012c</small>/ evolved into a short /e/, resulting in the word <small>ESPA\u0147OL(U)</small>.\n\nThere are other hypotheses apart from the one suggested by the Royal Spanish Academy. Some [[Philology|philologists]] argue that \"espa\u00f1ol\" comes from [[Occitan language|Occitan]] ''espaignon''. On the other hand, Spanish philologist [[Ram\u00f3n Men\u00e9ndez Pidal|Men\u00e9ndez Pidal]] suggested that the classic ''hispanus'' or ''hispanicus'' took the suffix ''-one'' from [[Vulgar Latin]], as it happened with other words such as ''bret\u00f3n'' (Breton) or ''saj\u00f3n'' (Saxon). The term ''hispanione'' evolved into the [[Old Spanish language|Old Spanish]] ''espa\u00f1\u00f3n'', which eventually, became ''espa\u00f1ol''.{{citation needed|date=January 2020}}\n\n== History ==\n{{Main|History of the Spanish language}}\n\n[[File:CartulariosValpuesta.jpg|right|thumb|The Visigothic [[Cartularies of Valpuesta]], written in a late form of Latin, were declared in 2010 by the Spanish Royal Academy as the record of the earliest words written in Castilian, predating those of the [[Glosas Emilianenses]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.euskonews.com/udalak/valpuesta/cartularioshistoria.htm|title=cartularioshistoria|website=www.euskonews.com|access-date=22 September 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160402124945/http://www.euskonews.com/udalak/valpuesta/cartularioshistoria.htm|archive-date=2 April 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref>]]\n\nThe Spanish language evolved from [[Vulgar Latin]], which was brought to the [[Iberian Peninsula]] by the [[Roman Republic|Romans]] during the [[Second Punic War]], beginning in 210 BC. Previously, several pre-Roman languages (also called [[Paleohispanic languages]])\u2014some related to Latin via Indo-European, and some that are not related at all\u2014were spoken in the Iberian Peninsula. These languages included [[Basque language|Basque]] (still spoken today), [[Iberian language|Iberian]], [[Celtiberian language|Celtiberian]] and [[Gallaecian language|Gallaecian]].\n\nThe first documents to show traces of what is today regarded as the precursor of modern Spanish are from the 9th century. Throughout the [[Middle Ages]] and into the [[modern era]], the most important influences on the Spanish lexicon came from neighboring [[Romance languages]]\u2014[[Mozarabic language|Mozarabic]] ([[Andalusi Romance]]), [[Navarro-Aragonese]], [[Leonese language|Leonese]], [[Catalan language|Catalan]], [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], [[Galician language|Galician]], [[Occitan language|Occitan]], and later, [[French language|French]] and [[Italian language|Italian]]. Spanish also borrowed a considerable number of words from [[Arabic language|Arabic]], as well as a minor influence from the Germanic [[Gothic language]] through the migration of tribes and a period of [[Visigoth]] rule in Iberia. In addition, many more words were borrowed from [[Latin language|Latin]] through the influence of written language and the liturgical language of the Church. The loanwords were taken from both [[Classical Latin]] and [[Renaissance Latin]], the form of Latin in use at that time.\n\nAccording to the theories of [[Ram\u00f3n Men\u00e9ndez Pidal]], local [[sociolect]]s of Vulgar Latin evolved into Spanish, in the north of Iberia, in an area centered in the city of [[Burgos]], and this dialect was later brought to the city of [[Toledo (Spain)|Toledo]], where the written standard of Spanish was first developed, in the 13th century.<ref name=Penny1>{{cite book |title= A History Of The Spanish Language|last=Penny|first= Ralph|authorlink= |year= 2002|publisher=Cambridge University Press |edition= 2|pages= 20\u201321}}</ref> In this formative stage, Spanish developed a strongly differing variant from its close cousin, [[Leonese Language|Leonese]], and, according to some authors, was distinguished by a heavy Basque influence (see [[Iberian Romance languages]]). This distinctive dialect spread to southern Spain with the advance of the {{lang|es|[[Reconquista]]}}, and meanwhile gathered a sizable lexical influence from the [[Arabic language|Arabic]] of [[Al-Andalus]], much of it indirectly, through the Romance [[Mozarabic language|Mozarabic dialects]] (some 4,000 [[Arabic language|Arabic]]-derived words, make up around 8% of the language today).<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1O29-SPANISH.html|title=Concise Oxford Companion to the English Language|publisher=Oxford University Press|date=|accessdate=24 July 2008}}</ref> The written standard for this new language was developed in the cities of [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]], in the 13th to 16th centuries, and [[Madrid]], from the 1570s.<ref name=Penny1 />\n\nThe development of the [[Spanish phonology|Spanish sound system]] from that of [[Vulgar Latin]] exhibits most of the changes that are typical of [[Western Romance languages]], including [[lenition]] of intervocalic consonants (thus Latin {{lang|la|{{smallcaps|v\u012bta}}}} > Spanish {{lang|es|vida}}).

For details on borrowed words and other external influences upon Spanish, see [[Influences on the Spanish language]].\n\n== Grammar ==\n{{Main|Spanish grammar}}\n[[File:Cervantes J\u00e1uregui.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Miguel de Cervantes]], considered by many the greatest author of Spanish literature, and author of ''[[Don Quixote]]'', widely considered the first modern European novel.]]\n\nMost of the grammatical and [[Linguistic typology|typological]] features of Spanish are shared with the other [[Romance languages]]. Spanish is a [[fusional language]]. The [[Spanish nouns|noun]] and [[Spanish adjectives|adjective]] systems exhibit two [[Grammatical gender|genders]] and two [[Grammatical number|numbers]]. In addition, articles and some [[Spanish pronouns|pronouns]] and [[Spanish determiners|determiners]] have a neuter gender in their singular form. There are about fifty [[Grammatical conjugation|conjugated]] forms per [[verb]], with 3 tenses: past, present, future; 2 aspects for past: perfective, imperfective; 4 moods: indicative, subjunctive, conditional, imperative; 3 persons: first, second, third; 2 numbers: singular, plural; 3 [[verboid]] forms: infinitive, gerund, and past participle. Verbs express [[T-V distinction]] by using different persons for formal and informal addresses. (For a detailed overview of verbs, see [[Spanish verbs]] and [[Spanish irregular verbs]].)\n\nSpanish [[syntax]] is considered [[Branching (linguistics)|right-branching]], meaning that subordinate or [[Grammatical modifier|modifying]] [[Constituent (linguistics)|constituents]] tend to be placed after their head words. The language uses [[Preposition and postposition|prepositions]] (rather than postpositions or inflection of nouns for [[Grammatical case|case]]), and usually\u2014though not always\u2014places [[adjective]]s after [[noun]]s, as do most other Romance languages.\n\nThe language is classified as a [[subject\u2013verb\u2013object]] language; however, as in most Romance languages, constituent order is highly variable and governed mainly by [[topicalization]] and [[Focus (linguistics)|focus]] rather than by syntax. It is a \"[[Pro-drop language|pro-drop]]\", or \"[[Null-subject language|null-subject]]\" language\u2014that is, it allows the deletion of subject pronouns when they are [[Pragmatics|pragmatically]] unnecessary. Spanish is described as a \"[[Verb framing|verb-framed]]\" language, meaning that the ''direction'' of motion is expressed in the verb while the ''mode'' of locomotion is expressed adverbially (e.g. ''subir corriendo'' or ''salir volando''; the respective English equivalents of these examples\u2014'to run up' and 'to fly out'\u2014show that English is, by contrast, \"satellite-framed\", with mode of locomotion expressed in the verb and direction in an adverbial modifier).\n\nSubject/verb inversion is not required in questions, and thus the recognition of declarative or interrogative may depend entirely on intonation.\n\n== Phonology ==\n{{IPA notice}}\n[[File:Miguel Hache - voice.ogg|thumb|Spanish spoken in Spain]]\n{{Main|Spanish phonology}}\n\nThe Spanish phonemic system is originally descended from that of [[Vulgar Latin]]. Its development exhibits some traits in common with the neighboring dialects\u2014especially [[Leonese dialect|Leonese]] and [[Aragonese language|Aragonese]]\u2014as well as other traits unique to [[Castilian Spanish|Castilian]]. Castilian is unique among its neighbors in the aspiration and eventual loss of the Latin initial {{IPA|/f/}} sound (e.g. Cast. {{lang|es|harina}} vs. Leon. and Arag. {{lang|ast|farina}}).<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Zamora Vicente|1967|pp=117 and 222}}</ref> The Latin initial consonant sequences {{lang|la|pl-}}, {{lang|la|cl-}}, and {{lang|la|fl-}} in Spanish typically become {{lang|es|ll-}} (originally pronounced {{IPA|[\u028e]}}), while in Aragonese they are preserved, and in Leonese they present a variety of outcomes, including {{IPA|[t\u0283]}}, {{IPA|[\u0283]}}, and {{IPA|[\u028e]}}. Where Latin had {{lang|la|-li-}} before a vowel (e.g. {{lang|la|filius}}) or the ending {{lang|la|-iculus}}, {{lang|la|-icula}} (e.g. {{lang|la|auricula}}), Old Spanish produced {{IPA|[\u0292]}}, that in Modern Spanish became the velar fricative {{IPA|[x]}} ({{lang|es|hijo}}, {{lang|es|oreja}}, where neighboring languages have the palatal lateral {{IPA|[\u028e]}} (e.g. Portuguese {{lang|pt|filho}}, {{lang|pt|orelha}}; Catalan {{lang|ca|fill}}, {{lang|ca|orella}}).\n\n=== Segmental phonology ===\n[[File:Spanish vowel chart.svg|thumb|upright=1.15|Spanish vowel chart, from {{Harvcoltxt|Ladefoged|Johnson|2010|p=227}}]]\nThe Spanish [[Phoneme|phonemic]] inventory consists of five vowel phonemes ({{IPA|/a/}}, {{IPA|/e/}}, {{IPA|/i/}}, {{IPA|/o/}}, {{IPA|/u/}}) and 17 to 19 consonant phonemes (the exact number depending on the dialect<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Hualde|2014|p=39}}</ref>). The main [[Allophone|allophonic]] variation among vowels is the reduction of the high vowels {{IPA|/i/}} and {{IPA|/u/}} to glides\u2014{{IPA|[j]}} and {{IPA|[w]}} respectively\u2014when unstressed and adjacent to another vowel. Some instances of the mid vowels {{IPA|/e/}} and {{IPA|/o/}}, determined lexically, alternate with the diphthongs {{IPA|/je/}} and {{IPA|/we/}} respectively when stressed, in a process that is better described as [[Morphophonology|morphophonemic]] rather than phonological, as it is not predictable from phonology alone.\n\nThe Spanish consonant system is characterized by (1) three [[nasal stop|nasal]] phonemes, and one or two (depending on the dialect) [[lateral consonant|lateral]] phoneme(s), which in syllable-final position [[Archiphonemic|lose their contrast]] and are subject to [[Assimilation (linguistics)|assimilation]] to a following consonant; (2) three [[Voicelessness|voiceless]] [[Plosive|stops]] and the [[Affricate consonant|affricate]] {{IPA|/t\u0283/}}; (3) three or four (depending on the dialect) [[Voicelessness|voiceless]] [[Fricative consonant|fricatives]]; (4) a set of voiced [[obstruent]]s\u2014{{IPA|/b/}}, {{IPA|/d/}}, {{IPA|/\u0261/}}, and sometimes {{IPA|/\u029d/}}\u2014which alternate between [[Approximant consonant|approximant]] and [[plosive]] allophones depending on the environment; and (5) a phonemic distinction between the \"[[Flap consonant|tapped]]\" and \"[[Trill consonant|trilled]]\" ''r''-sounds (single {{angle bracket|r}} and double {{angle bracket|rr}} in orthography).\n\nIn the following table of consonant phonemes, {{IPA|/\u028e/}} is marked with an asterisk (*) to indicate that it is preserved only in some dialects. In most dialects it has been merged with {{IPA|/\u029d/}} in the merger called {{lang|es|[[ye\u00edsmo]]}}. Similarly, {{IPA|/\u03b8/}} is also marked with an asterisk to indicate that most dialects do not distinguish it from {{IPA|/s/}} (see {{lang|es|[[seseo]]}}), although this is not a true merger but an outcome of different evolution of sibilants in Southern Spain.\n\nThe phoneme {{IPA|/\u0283/}} is in parentheses () to indicate that it appears only in [[loanwords]]. Each of the voiced obstruent phonemes {{IPA|/b/}}, {{IPA|/d/}}, {{IPA|/\u029d/}}, and {{IPA|/\u0261/}} appears to the right of a ''pair'' of voiceless phonemes, to indicate that, while the ''voiceless'' phonemes maintain a phonemic contrast between plosive (or affricate) and fricative, the ''voiced'' ones alternate [[Allophone|allophonically]] (i.e. without phonemic contrast) between plosive and approximant pronunciations.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin: 1em auto 1em auto; text-align: center;\"\n|+ Consonant phonemes<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Mart\u00ednez-Celdr\u00e1n|Fern\u00e1ndez-Planas|Carrera-Sabat\u00e9|2003|p=255}}</ref>\n|-\n!\n! colspan=2 | [[Labial consonant|Labial]]\n! colspan=2 | [[Dental consonant|Dental]]\n! colspan=2 | [[Alveolar consonant|Alveolar]]\n! colspan=2 | [[Palatal consonant|Palatal]]\n! colspan=2 | [[Velar consonant|Velar]]\n|-\n!

The ''tendencies'' of stress assignment are as follows:<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Eddington|2000|p=96}}</ref>\n* In words that end with a vowel, stress most often falls on the penultimate syllable.\n* In words that end with a consonant, stress most often falls on the last syllable, with the following exceptions: The grammatical endings {{lang|es|-n}} (for third-person-plural of verbs) and {{lang|es|-s}} (whether for plural of nouns and adjectives or for second-person-singular of verbs) do not change the location of stress. Thus, regular ''verbs'' ending with {{lang|es|-n}} and the great majority of words ending with {{lang|es|-s}} are stressed on the penult. Although a significant number of nouns and adjectives ending with {{lang|es|-n}} are also stressed on the penult ({{lang|es|joven}}, {{lang|es|virgen}}, {{lang|es|mitin}}), the great majority of nouns and adjectives ending with {{lang|es|-n}} are stressed on their last syllable ({{lang|es|capit\u00e1n}}, {{lang|es|almac\u00e9n}}, {{lang|es|jard\u00edn}}, {{lang|es|coraz\u00f3n}}).\n* Preantepenultimate stress (stress on the fourth-to-last syllable) occurs rarely, only on verbs with [[clitic]] pronouns attached ({{lang|es|guard\u00e1ndoselos}} 'saving them for him/her/them/you').\n\nIn addition to the many exceptions to these tendencies, there are numerous [[minimal pair]]s that contrast solely on stress such as {{lang|es|s\u00e1bana}} ('sheet') and {{lang|es|sabana}} ('savannah'); {{lang|es|l\u00edmite}} ('boundary'), {{lang|es|limite}} ('[that] he/she limits') and {{lang|es|limit\u00e9}} ('I limited'); {{lang|es|l\u00edquido}} ('liquid'), {{lang|es|liquido}} ('I sell off') and {{lang|es|liquid\u00f3}} ('he/she sold off').\n\nThe orthographic system unambiguously reflects where the stress occurs: in the absence of an accent mark, the stress falls on the last syllable unless the last letter is {{angle bracket|n}}, {{angle bracket|s}}, or a vowel, in which cases the stress falls on the next-to-last (penultimate) syllable. Exceptions to those rules are indicated by an acute accent mark over the vowel of the stressed syllable.

The variant is very similar to Mexican Spanish, because of Mexican and Latin American emigration to the Spanish East Indies over the years. \nFrom 1565 to 1821, the Philippines, which were a part of the Spanish East Indies, were governed by the Captaincy General of the Philippines as a territory of the Viceroyalty of New Spain centered in Mexico. It was only administered directly from Spain in 1821 after Mexico gained its independence that same year. Since the Philippines was a former territory of the Viceroyalty of New Spain for most of the Spanish colonial period, Spanish as was spoken in the Philippines had a greater affinity to American Spanish rather than to Peninsular Spanish. \n\n====Chavacano====\n{{main article|Chavacano}}\nChavacano or Chabacano [t\u0283a\u03b2a\u02c8kano] is a group of Spanish-based creole language varieties spoken in the Philippines. The variety spoken in Zamboanga City, located in the southern Philippine island group of Mindanao, has the highest concentration of speakers. Other currently existing varieties are found in Cavite City and Ternate, located in the Cavite province on the island of Luzon.[4] Chavacano is the only Spanish-based creole in Asia.\n\n===Oceania===\nSpanish is also the official language and the most spoken on [[Easter Island]] which is geographically part of [[Polynesia]] in Oceania and politically part of [[Chile]]. Easter Island's traditional language is [[Rapa Nui language|Rapa Nui]], an [[Polynesian languages|Eastern Polynesian language]].\n[[File:Parque Nacional Rapa Nui.jpg|thumb|Announcement in Spanish on [[Easter Island]], welcoming visitors to [[Rapa Nui National Park]]]]\nSpanish loan words are present in the local languages of [[Guam]], [[Northern Mariana Islands]], [[Palau]], [[Marshall Islands]] and [[Federated States of Micronesia|Micronesia]], all of which formerly comprised the [[Spanish East Indies]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.als.asn.au/proceedings/als2005/engelberg-german.pdf |title=The Influence of German on the Lexicon of Palauan and Kosraean (Dissertation)|last=Engelberg |first=Stefan |accessdate=23 August 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Spanish language in Philippines|url=http://www.spanish-in-the-world.net/Spanish/philippines.php|accessdate=1 March 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150318055051/http://www.spanish-in-the-world.net/Spanish/philippines.php|archivedate=18 March 2015}}</ref>\n\n{{-}}\n== Spanish speakers by country ==\nThe following table shows the number of Spanish speakers in some 79 countries.\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" <!-- If you can make the \"sort\" function work according to numerical values, then change \"wikitable\", above, back to \"wikitable sortable\".

the main dialects of Spanish.]]\n{{Main|Spanish dialects and varieties}}\nThere are important variations ([[Phonology|phonological]], [[Grammar|grammatical]], and [[Lexicon|lexical]]) in the spoken Spanish of the various regions of Spain and throughout the Spanish-speaking areas of the Americas.\n\nThe variety with the most speakers is [[Mexican Spanish]]. It is spoken by more than twenty percent of the world's Spanish speakers (more than 112 million of the total of more than 500 million, according to the table above). One of its main features is the [[vowel reduction|reduction]] or loss of [[unstressed vowel]]s, mainly when they are in contact with the sound /s/.<ref>Eleanor Greet Cotton, John M. Sharp (1988) ''Spanish in the Americas, Volume 2'', pp.154\u2013155, [https://books.google.com/books?id=89KX2RC6Gx0C&pg=PA154&dq=Mexican+vowels&client=firefox-a#v=onepage&q=Mexican%20vowels&f=false URL]</ref><ref>Lope Blanch, Juan M.

Even so, the speech of Madrid, which has typically southern features such as [[ye\u00edsmo]] and s-aspiration, is the standard variety for use on radio and television.<ref>{{cite book |title=Random House Unabridged Dictionary |year=2006 |publisher= Random House Inc. }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |title=The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language |year=2006 |edition=4th |publisher= Houghton Mifflin Company }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |title=Webster's Revised Unabridged Dictionary |year=1998 |publisher= MICRA, Inc. }}</ref><ref>{{cite encyclopedia|url=http://encarta.msn.com/dictionary_1861595345/Castilian.html |title=Encarta World English Dictionary |accessdate=5 August 2008 |year=2007 |publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing Plc. |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090831041048/http://encarta.msn.com/dictionary_1861595345/Castilian.html |archivedate=31 August 2009 |df= }}</ref> However, the variety used in the media is that of Madrid's educated classes, where southern traits are less evident, in contrast with the variety spoken by working-class Madrid, where those traits are pervasive. The educated variety of Madrid is indicated by many as the one that has most influenced the written standard for Spanish.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Penny |first1=Ralph |title= Variation and Change in Spanish |year= 2000 |publisher= Cambridge University Press |isbn=0-521-78045-4 |page= 199 |quote= ''whatever might be claimed by other centres, such as Valladolid, it was educated varieties of Madrid Spanish that were mostly regularly reflected in the written standard.''}}</ref>\n\n=== Phonology ===\nThe four main phonological divisions are based respectively on (1) the phoneme [[Voiceless dental fricative|{{IPA|/\u03b8/}}]] (\"theta\"), (2) the [[debuccalization]] of syllable-final {{IPA|/s/}}, (3) the sound of the spelled {{angle bracket|s}}, (4) and the phoneme [[Palatal lateral approximant|{{IPA|/\u028e/}}]] (\"turned ''y''\"),<ref>The [[International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]] symbol \"turned ''y''\" (\u028e), with its \"tail\" leaning to the right, resembles, but is technically different from, the Greek letter lambda (\u03bb), whose tail leans to the left.</ref>\n* The phoneme {{IPA|/\u03b8/}} (spelled {{lang|es|c}} before {{lang|es|e}} or {{lang|es|i}} and spelled {{angle bracket|z}} elsewhere), a [[voiceless dental fricative]] as in English '''''th'''ing'', is maintained by a majority of Spain's population, especially in the northern and central parts of the country. In other areas (some parts of southern Spain, the [[Canary Islands]], and the Americas), {{IPA|/\u03b8/}} doesn't exist and {{IPA|/s/}} occurs instead. The maintenance of phonemic contrast is called {{lang|es|[[distinci\u00f3n]]}} in Spanish, while the merger is generally called {{lang|es|[[seseo]]}} (in reference to the usual realization of the merged phoneme as {{IPA|[s]}}) or, occasionally, {{lang|es|[[ceceo]]}} (referring to its interdental realization, {{IPA|[\u03b8]}}, in some parts of southern Spain). In most of Hispanic America, the spelled {{angle bracket|c}} before {{angle bracket|e}} or {{angle bracket|i}}, and spelled {{angle bracket|z}} is always pronounced as a [[Voiceless alveolar sibilant#Dentalized laminal alveolar|voiceless dental sibilant]].\n* The debuccalization (pronunciation as {{IPA|[h]}}, or loss) of syllable-final {{IPA|/s/}} is associated with the southern half of Spain and lowland Americas: Central America (except central Costa Rica and Guatemala), the Caribbean, coastal areas of southern Mexico, and South America except Andean highlands. Debuccalization is frequently called \"aspiration\" in English, and {{lang|es|aspiraci\u00f3n}} in Spanish. When there is no debuccalization, the syllable-final {{IPA|/s/}} is pronounced as [[Voiceless alveolar sibilant#Retracted alveolar|voiceless \"apico-alveolar\" sibilant]] or as a [[Voiceless alveolar sibilant#Dentalized laminal alveolar|voiceless dental sibilant]] in the same fashion as in the next paragraph.\n* The sound that corresponds to the letter {{angle bracket|s}} is pronounced in northern and central Spain as a [[Voiceless alveolar sibilant#Retracted alveolar|voiceless \"apico-alveolar\" sibilant]] {{IPA|[s\u033a]}} (also described acoustically as \"[[Grave and acute|grave]]\" and articulatorily as \"retracted\"), with a weak \"hushing\" sound reminiscent of {{lcons|retroflex}} fricatives. In [[Andalusia]], [[Canary Islands]] and most of Hispanic America (except in the [[Colombian Spanish#Paisa dialect|Paisa region]] of Colombia) it is pronounced as a [[Voiceless alveolar sibilant#Dentalized laminal alveolar|voiceless dental sibilant]] {{IPA|[s]}}, much like the most frequent pronunciation of the /s/ of English. Because /s/ is one of the most frequent phonemes in Spanish, the difference of pronunciation is one of the first to be noted by a Spanish-speaking person to differentiate Spaniards from Spanish-speakers of the Americas.{{Citation needed|date=June 2017}}\n* The phoneme {{IPA|/\u028e/}} spelled {{angle bracket|ll}}, [[Palatal lateral approximant|palatal lateral]] consonant sometimes compared in sound to the sound of the {{angle bracket|lli}} of English ''million'', tends to be maintained in less-urbanized areas of northern Spain and in [[Andean Spanish|highland areas of South America]]. Meanwhile, in the speech of most other Spanish-speakers, it is merged with {{IPA|/\u029d/}} (\"curly-tail ''j''\"), a non-lateral, usually voiced, usually fricative, palatal consonant, sometimes compared to English {{IPA|/j/}} (''yod'') as in '''''y'''acht'' and spelled {{angle bracket|y}} in Spanish. As with other forms of allophony across world languages, the small difference of the spelled {{angle bracket|ll}} and the spelled {{angle bracket|y}} is usually not perceived (the difference is not heard) by people who do not produce them as different phonemes. Such a phonemic merger is called {{lang|es|[[ye\u00edsmo]]}} in Spanish. In [[Rioplatense Spanish]], the merged phoneme is generally pronounced as a postalveolar fricative, either voiced {{IPA|[\u0292]}} (as in English ''measure'' or the French {{angle bracket|j}}) in the central and western parts of the dialectal region ({{lang|es|zhe\u00edsmo}}), or voiceless {{IPA|[\u0283]}} (as in the French {{angle bracket|ch}} or Portuguese {{angle bracket|x}}) in and around Buenos Aires and Montevideo ({{lang|es|she\u00edsmo}}).<ref>Charles B.

The use of {{lang|es|vos}} (and/or its verb forms) is called {{lang|es|[[voseo]]}}. In a few dialects, all three pronouns are used, with {{lang|es|usted}}, {{lang|es|t\u00fa}}, and {{lang|es|vos}} denoting respectively formality, familiarity, and intimacy.<ref name=\"rae.es site\">{{cite web|url=http://buscon.rae.es/dpdI/ |title=Real Academia Espa\u00f1ola |language= es |publisher=Buscon.rae.es |date= |accessdate=21 April 2010}}</ref>\n\nIn {{lang|es|voseo}}, {{lang|es|vos}} is the [[Subject (grammar)|subject]] form ({{lang|es|vos dec\u00eds}}, \"you say\") and the form for the object of a [[Preposition and postposition|preposition]] ({{lang|es|voy con vos}}, \"I am going with you\"), while the direct and indirect [[Object (grammar)|object]] forms, and the [[Possessive adjective|possessives]], are the same as those associated with {{lang|es|t\u00fa}}: {{lang|es|Vos sab\u00e9s que tus amigos te respetan}} (\"You know your friends respect you\").\n\nThe verb forms of ''general voseo'' are the same as those used with {{lang|es|t\u00fa}} except in the present [[grammatical tense|tense]] ([[indicative]] and [[imperative mood|imperative]]) verbs. The forms for {{lang|es|vos}} generally can be derived from those of {{lang|es|vosotros}} (the traditional second-person familiar ''plural'') by deleting the [[semivowel|glide]] {{IPA|[i\u032f]}}, or {{IPA|/d/}}, where it appears in the ending: {{lang|es|vosotros pens\u00e1'''i'''s}} > {{lang|es|vos pens\u00e1s}}; {{lang|es|vosotros volv\u00e9'''i'''s}} > {{lang|es|vos volv\u00e9s}}, {{lang|es|pensa'''d'''!}} ({{lang|es|vosotros}}) > {{lang|es|pens\u00e1!}} ({{lang|es|vos}}), {{lang|es|volve'''d'''!}} ({{lang|es|vosotros}}) > {{lang|es|volv\u00e9!}} ({{lang|es|vos}}) .\n{| cellpadding=\"5\" class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ General voseo <small>([[Rioplatense Spanish|River Plate Spanish]])</small>\n! colspan=\"5\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|Indicative\n! colspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|Subjunctive\n! rowspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|Imperative\n|-\n!

Generally, it can be said that there are zones of exclusive use of {{lang|es|tuteo}} (the use of {{lang|es|t\u00fa}}) in the following areas: almost all of [[Mexico]], the West Indies, [[Panama]], most of [[Colombia]], [[Peru]], [[Venezuela]] and coastal [[Ecuador]].\n\n{{lang|es|Tuteo}} as a cultured form alternates with {{lang|es|voseo}} as a popular or rural form in [[Bolivia]], in the north and south of Peru, in Andean Ecuador, in small zones of the Venezuelan Andes (and most notably in the Venezuelan state of [[Zulia]]), and in a large part of Colombia. Some researchers maintain that {{lang|es|voseo}} can be heard in some parts of eastern Cuba, and others assert that it is absent from the island.<ref>Katia Salamanca de Abreu, [http://cvc.cervantes.es/lengua/thesaurus/pdf/28/TH_28_001_138_0.pdf review of Humberto L\u00f3pez Morales, ''Estudios sobre el espa\u00f1ol de Cuba''] (New York: Editorial Las Am\u00e9ricas, 1970), in ''Thesaurus'', 28 (1973), 138\u2013146.</ref>\n\n{{lang|es|Tuteo}} exists as the second-person usage with an intermediate degree of formality alongside the more familiar {{lang|es|voseo}} in [[Chile]], in the Venezuelan state of [[Zulia]], on the Caribbean coast of [[Colombia]], in the [[Azuero Peninsula]] in Panama, in the Mexican state of [[Chiapas]], and in parts of Guatemala.\n\nAreas of generalized {{lang|es|voseo}} include [[Argentina]], [[Nicaragua]], eastern [[Bolivia]], [[El Salvador]], [[Guatemala]], [[Honduras]], [[Costa Rica]], [[Paraguay]], [[Uruguay]] and the Colombian departments of [[Antioquia Department|Antioquia]], [[Caldas Department|Caldas]], [[Risaralda Department|Risaralda]], [[Quindio]] and [[Valle del Cauca]].<ref name=\"rae.es site\" />\n\n==== Ustedes ====\n{{lang|es|Ustedes}} functions as formal and informal second person plural in over 90% of the Spanish-speaking world, including all of Hispanic America, the [[Canary Islands]], and some regions of [[Andalusia]]. In [[Seville]], [[Huelva]], [[Cadiz]], and other parts of western [[Andalusia]], the familiar form is constructed as {{lang|es|ustedes vais}}, using the traditional second-person plural form of the verb. Most of Spain maintains the [[T-V distinction|formal/familiar distinction]] with {{lang|es|ustedes}} and {{lang|es|vosotros}} respectively.\n\n==== Usted ====\n{{lang|es|Usted}} is the usual second-person singular pronoun in a formal context, but it is used jointly with the third-person singular voice of the verb. It is used to convey respect toward someone who is a generation older or is of higher authority (\"you, sir\"/\"you, ma'am\"). It is also used in a ''familiar'' context by many speakers in Colombia and Costa Rica and in parts of Ecuador and Panama, to the exclusion of {{lang|es|t\u00fa}} or {{lang|es|vos}}. This usage is sometimes called {{lang|es|[[:es:Ustedeo|ustedeo]]}} in Spanish.\n\nIn Central America, especially in Honduras, {{lang|es|usted}} is often used as a formal pronoun to convey respect between the members of a romantic couple. {{lang|es|Usted}} is also used that way between parents and children in the Andean regions of Ecuador, Colombia and Venezuela.\n\n==== Third-person object pronouns ====\nMost speakers use (and the {{lang|es|[[Real Academia Espa\u00f1ola]]}} prefers) the pronouns {{lang|es|lo}} and {{lang|es|la}} for [[Direct object#The object in linguistics|''direct'' objects]] (masculine and feminine respectively, regardless of [[animacy]], meaning \"him\", \"her\", or \"it\"), and {{lang|es|le}} for [[Direct object#The object in linguistics|''indirect'' objects]] (regardless of [[Grammatical gender|gender]] or [[animacy]], meaning \"to him\", \"to her\", or \"to it\"). The usage is sometimes called \"etymological\", as these direct and indirect object pronouns are a continuation, respectively, of the [[Accusative case|accusative]] and [[Dative case|dative]] pronouns of Latin, the ancestor language of Spanish.\n\nDeviations from this norm (more common in Spain than in the Americas) are called \"{{lang|es|[[le\u00edsmo]]}}\", \"{{lang|es|[[lo\u00edsmo]]}}\", or \"{{lang|es|[[la\u00edsmo]]}}\", according to which respective pronoun, {{lang|es|le}}, {{lang|es|lo}}, or {{lang|es|la}}, has expanded beyond the etymological usage ({{lang|es|le}} as a direct object, or {{lang|es|lo}} or {{lang|es|la}} as an indirect object).\n\n=== Vocabulary ===\nSome words can be significantly different in different Hispanophone countries. Most Spanish speakers can recognize other Spanish forms even in places where they are not commonly used, but Spaniards generally do not recognize specifically American usages. For example, Spanish {{lang|es|mantequilla}}, {{lang|es|aguacate}} and {{lang|es|albaricoque}} (respectively, 'butter', 'avocado', 'apricot') correspond to {{lang|es|manteca}} (word used for [[lard]] in [[Peninsular Spanish]]), {{lang|es|palta}}, and {{lang|es|damasco}}, respectively, in Argentina, Chile (except {{lang|es|manteca}}), Paraguay, Peru (except {{lang|es|manteca}} and {{lang|es|damasco}}), and Uruguay.\n\n== Relation to other languages ==\n{{further|Comparison of Portuguese and Spanish}}\nSpanish is closely related to the other [[West Iberian languages|West Iberian Romance languages]], including [[Asturian language|Asturian]], [[Aragonese language|Aragonese]], [[Galician language|Galician]], [[Ladino language|Ladino]], [[Leonese Language|Leonese]], [[Mirandese language|Mirandese]] and [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]].\n\nIt is generally acknowledged that Portuguese and Spanish speakers can communicate in written form, with varying degrees of mutual intelligibility.<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Jensen|1989}}</ref><ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Penny|2000|p=14}}</ref><ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Dalby|1998|p=501}}</ref><ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Ginsburgh|Weber|2011|p=90}}</ref>\n[[Mutual intelligibility]] of the ''written'' Spanish and Portuguese languages is remarkably high, and the difficulties of the spoken forms are based more on phonology than on grammatical and lexical dissimilarities. ''[[Ethnologue]]'' gives estimates of the [[lexical similarity]] between related languages in terms of precise percentages. For Spanish and Portuguese, that figure is 89%. Italian, on the other hand its phonology similar to Spanish, but has a lower lexical similarity of 82%. Mutual intelligibility between Spanish and [[French language|French]] or between Spanish and [[Romanian language|Romanian]] is lower still, given lexical similarity ratings of 75% and 71% respectively.<ref name=\"ethnologue\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=spa|title=Spanish|work=Ethnologue}}</ref><ref name=\"ezglot\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ezglot.com/most-similar-languages.php?l=spa|title=Similar languages to Spanish|work=EZGlot}}</ref> And comprehension of Spanish by French speakers who have not studied the language is much lower, at an estimated 45%. In general, thanks to the common features of the writing systems of the Romance languages, interlingual comprehension of the written word is greater than that of oral communication.\n\nThe following table compares the forms of some common words in several Romance languages:\n<div style=\"overflow:auto;\">\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Other theories suggest, on the basis of what is used to make cheese, a derivation from Latin ''brandeum'' (originally meaning a linen covering, later a thin cloth for relic storage) through an intermediate root *''brandea''. For the development of the meaning, cf. Spanish ''manteca'', Portuguese ''manteiga'', probably from Latin ''mantica'' ('sack'), Italian ''formaggio'' and French ''fromage'' from ''formaticus''.

Therefore, its relationship to Spanish is comparable with that of the [[Yiddish language]] to [[German language|German]]. Ladino speakers today are almost exclusively [[Sephardim|Sephardi]] Jews, with family roots in Turkey, Greece, or the Balkans, and living mostly in Israel, Turkey, and the United States, with a few communities in Hispanic America.<ref name=\"Ladino\" /> Judaeo-Spanish lacks the [[Amerindian languages|Native American vocabulary]] which was acquired by standard Spanish during the [[Spanish Empire|Spanish colonial period]], and it retains many archaic features which have since been lost in standard Spanish. It contains, however, other vocabulary which is not found in standard Spanish, including vocabulary from [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]], French, Greek and [[Turkish language|Turkish]], and other languages spoken where the Sephardim settled.\n\nJudaeo-Spanish is in serious danger of extinction because many native speakers today are elderly as well as elderly ''olim'' (immigrants to [[Israel]]) who have not transmitted the language to their children or grandchildren. However, it is experiencing a minor revival among Sephardi communities, especially in music. In the case of the Latin American communities, the danger of extinction is also due to the risk of assimilation by modern Castilian.\n\nA related dialect is [[Haketia]], the Judaeo-Spanish of northern Morocco. This too tended to assimilate with modern Spanish, during the Spanish occupation of the region.\n\n== Writing system ==\n{{Main|Spanish orthography}}\n{{Spanish language}}\nSpanish is written in the [[Latin script]], with the addition of the character {{angle bracket|[[\u00f1]]}} ({{lang|es|e\u00f1e}}, representing the phoneme {{IPA|/[[Palatal nasal|\u0272]]/}}, a letter distinct from {{angle bracket|n}}, although typographically composed of an {{angle bracket|n}} with a [[tilde]]). Formerly the [[digraph (orthography)|digraphs]] {{angle bracket|ch}} ({{lang|es|che}}, representing the phoneme {{IPA|/t\u0361\u0283/}}) and {{angle bracket|ll}} ({{lang|es|elle}}, representing the phoneme {{IPA|/[[Palatal lateral approximant|\u028e]]/}}), were also considered single letters. However, the digraph {{angle bracket|rr}} ({{lang|es|erre fuerte}}, 'strong r', {{lang|es|erre doble}}, 'double r', or simply {{lang|es|erre}}), which also represents a distinct phoneme {{IPA|/r/}}, was not similarly regarded as a single letter. Since 1994 {{angle bracket|ch}} and {{angle bracket|ll}} have been treated as letter pairs for [[collation]] purposes, though they remained a part of the alphabet until 2010. Words with {{angle bracket|ch}} are now alphabetically sorted between those with {{angle bracket|cg}} and {{angle bracket|ci}}, instead of following {{angle bracket|cz}} as they used to. The situation is similar for {{angle bracket|ll}}.<ref>[http://buscon.rae.es/dpdI/SrvltConsulta?lema=ch Diccionario Panhisp\u00e1nico de Dudas], 1st ed.</ref><ref>[http://www.rae.es/ Real Academia Espa\u00f1ola], [http://www.spanishpronto.com/spanishpronto/spanishalphabet.html Explanation] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070906105503/https://www.spanishpronto.com/spanishpronto/spanishalphabet.html |date=6 September 2007 }} at [http://www.spanishpronto.com/ Spanish Pronto] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070914002335/https://www.spanishpronto.com/ |date=14 September 2007 }} {{in lang|es|en}}</ref>\n\nThus, the Spanish alphabet has the following 27 letters:\n\n:{{lang|es|A, B, C,<!-- ch considered digraph - see next references. --> D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L,<!-- ll considered digraph - see next references. --> M, N, \u00d1, O, P, Q, R, <!-- but not rr See previous paragraph. --> S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.}}\n\nSince 2010, none of the digraphs ({{lang|es|ch, ll, rr, gu, qu}}) is considered a letter by the Spanish Royal Academy.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rae.es/consultas/exclusion-de-ch-y-ll-del-abecedario|title=Exclusi\u00f3n de ch y ll del abecedario &#124; Real Academia Espa\u00f1ola|website=www.rae.es}}</ref>\n\nThe letters {{lang|es|k}} and {{lang|es|w}} are used only in words and names coming from foreign languages ({{lang|es|kilo, folklore, whisky, kiwi}}, etc.).\n\nWith the exclusion of a very small number of regional terms such as {{lang|es|[[M\u00e9xico]]}} (see [[Toponymy of Mexico#Phonetic evolution|Toponymy of Mexico]]), pronunciation can be entirely determined from spelling. Under the orthographic conventions, a typical Spanish word is stressed on the [[syllable]] before the last if it ends with a vowel (not including {{angle bracket|y}}) or with a vowel followed by {{angle bracket|n}} or an {{angle bracket|s}}; it is stressed on the last syllable otherwise. Exceptions to this rule are indicated by placing an [[acute accent]] on the [[stress (linguistics)|stressed vowel]].\n\nThe acute accent is used, in addition, to distinguish between certain [[homophone]]s, especially when one of them is a stressed word and the other one is a [[clitic]]: compare {{lang|es|el}} ('the', masculine singular definite article) with {{lang|es|\u00e9l}} ('he' or 'it'), or {{lang|es|te}} ('you', object pronoun) with {{lang|es|t\u00e9}} ('tea'), {{lang|es|de}} (preposition 'of') versus {{lang|es|d\u00e9}} ('give' [formal imperative/third-person present subjunctive]), and {{lang|es|se}} (reflexive pronoun) versus {{lang|es|s\u00e9}} ('I know' or imperative 'be').\n\nThe interrogative pronouns ({{lang|es|qu\u00e9}}, {{lang|es|cu\u00e1l}}, {{lang|es|d\u00f3nde}}, {{lang|es|qui\u00e9n}}, etc.) also receive accents in direct or indirect questions, and some demonstratives ({{lang|es|\u00e9se}}, {{lang|es|\u00e9ste}}, {{lang|es|aqu\u00e9l}}, etc.) can be accented when used as pronouns. Accent marks used to be omitted on capital letters (a widespread practice in the days of [[typewriter]]s and the early days of computers when only lowercase vowels were available with accents), although the {{lang|es|Real Academia Espa\u00f1ola}} advises against this and the orthographic conventions taught at schools enforce the use of the accent.\n\nWhen {{lang|es|u}} is written between {{lang|es|g}} and a front vowel {{lang|es|e}} or {{lang|es|i}}, it indicates a \"[[Hard and soft G|hard g]]\" pronunciation. A [[Diaeresis (diacritic)|diaeresis]] {{lang|es|\u00fc}} indicates that it is not silent as it normally would be (e.g., {{lang|es|cig\u00fce\u00f1a}}, 'stork', is pronounced {{IPA|[\u03b8i\u02c8\u0263we\u0272a]}}; if it were written *{{lang|es|cigue\u00f1a}}, it would be pronounced *{{IPA|[\u03b8i\u02c8\u0263e\u0272a]}}).\n\nInterrogative and exclamatory clauses are introduced with [[inverted question and exclamation marks]] ({{lang|es|\u00bf}} and {{lang|es|\u00a1}}, respectively).\n\n== Organizations ==\n[[File:Academia de la Lengua.jpg|thumb|The [[Real Academia Espa\u00f1ola|Royal Spanish Academy]] Headquarters in [[Madrid]], [[Spain]].]]\n\n=== Royal Spanish Academy ===\n{{main|Royal Spanish Academy}}\n[[File:Coat of Arms of the Royal Spanish Academy.svg|left|thumb|upright=0.27|Arms of the Royal Spanish Academy]]\nThe Royal Spanish Academy ({{lang-es|Real Academia Espa\u00f1ola}}), founded in 1713,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lib.uwaterloo.ca/society/history/1713rae.html |title=Scholarly Societies Project |publisher=Lib.uwaterloo.ca |date= |accessdate=6 November 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100923234545/http://www.lib.uwaterloo.ca/society/history/1713rae.html |archivedate=23 September 2010 }}</ref> together with the 21 other national ones (see [[Association of Spanish Language Academies]]), exercises a standardizing influence through its publication of dictionaries and widely respected grammar and style guides.<ref>{{cite book|last=Batchelor|first=Ronald Ernest|title=Using Spanish: a guide to contemporary usage|year=1992|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=0-521-26987-3|page=318|url=https://books.google.com/?id=eEWZL1j9ig8C&pg=PA4&dq=real+academia+espa%C3%B1ola+recognized#v=onepage&q&f=false}}</ref>\nBecause of influence and for other sociohistorical reasons, a standardized form of the language ([[Standard Spanish]]) is widely acknowledged for use in literature, academic contexts and the media.\n\n=== Association of Spanish Language Academies ===\n{{main|Association of Spanish Language Academies}}\n[[File:Pa\u00edses con academia de la lengua espa\u00f1ola.png|thumb|Countries members of the ASALE.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.asale.org/ASALE/asale.html |title=Association of Spanish Language Academies |language=Spanish |publisher=Asale |accessdate=5 February 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100923155313/http://asale.org/ASALE/asale.html |archivedate=23 September 2010 }}</ref>]]\nThe Association of Spanish Language Academies ({{lang|es|Asociaci\u00f3n de Academias de la Lengua Espa\u00f1ola}}, or {{lang|es|ASALE}}) is the entity which regulates the Spanish language.

headquarters, [[Madrid]]]]\nThe {{lang|es|Instituto Cervantes}} (Cervantes Institute) is a worldwide nonprofit organization created by the Spanish government in 1991. This organization has branched out in over 20 different countries, with 75 centers devoted to the Spanish and Hispanic American cultures and Spanish language. The ultimate goals of the Institute are to promote universally the education, the study, and the use of Spanish as a second language, to support methods and activities that help the process of Spanish-language education, and to contribute to the advancement of the Spanish and Hispanic American cultures in non-Spanish-speaking countries. The Institute's 2015 report \"El espa\u00f1ol, una lengua viva\" (Spanish, a living language) estimated that there were 559 million Spanish speakers worldwide. Its latest annual report \"[https://www.cervantes.es/sobre_instituto_cervantes/prensa/2018/noticias/np_presentacion-anuario.htm El espa\u00f1ol en el mundo 2018]\" (Spanish in the world 2018) counts 577 million Spanish speakers worldwide. Among the sources cited in the report is the [[United States Census Bureau|U.S. Census Bureau]], which estimates that the U.S. will have 138 million Spanish speakers by 2050, making it the biggest Spanish-speaking nation on earth, with Spanish the mother tongue of almost a third of its citizens.<ref>Stephen Burgen, [https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/jun/29/us-second-biggest-spanish-speaking-country US now has more Spanish speakers than Spain \u2013 only Mexico has more], US News, 29 June 2015.</ref>\n\n=== Official use by international organizations ===\n{{Main|List of countries where Spanish is an official language#International organizations where Spanish is official}}\n\nSpanish is one of the official languages of the [[United Nations]], the [[European Union]], the [[World Trade Organization]], the [[Organization of American States]], the [[Organization of Ibero-American States]], the [[African Union]], the [[Union of South American Nations]], the [[Antarctic Treaty Secretariat]], the [[Latin Union]], the [[Caricom]], the [[North American Free Trade Agreement]], and numerous other international organizations.\n{{clear right}}\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Language}}\n{{col-start-fixed|width=calc(100% \u2013 256px)}}\n{{col-break}}\n* [[List of Spanish-language poets]]\n* [[Fund\u00e9u BBVA]]\n* [[Spanish as a second or foreign language]]\n\n; Spanish words and phrases\n* [[Longest word in Spanish]]\n* [[Most common words in Spanish]]\n* [[Spanish profanity]]\n* [[Spanish proverbs]]\n* [[List of English\u2013Spanish interlingual homographs]]\n* [[Cuento]]\n\n; [[Hispanosphere|Spanish-speaking world]]\n* [[List of countries where Spanish is an official language|Countries where Spanish is an official language]]\n* [[Hispanic culture]]\n* [[Hispanicization]]\n* [[Hispanidad]]\n* [[Hispanism]]\n* [[Hispanosphere]]\n* [[Panhispanism]]\n{{col-break}}\n; [[Influences on the Spanish language]]\n* [[Arabic influence on the Spanish language]]\n* [[List of Spanish words of Germanic origin]]\n* [[List of Spanish words of Nahuatl origin]]\n* [[List of Spanish words of Indigenous American Indian origin]]\n* [[List of Spanish words of Philippine origin]]\n; [[Spanish-based creole languages|Dialects and languages influenced by Spanish]]\n* [[Cal\u00f3 language|Cal\u00f3]]\n* [[Chamorro language|Chamorro]]\n* [[Chavacano]]\n* [[Frespa\u00f1ol]]\n* [[Judaeo-Spanish|Ladino]]\n* [[Llanito]]\n* [[Palenquero]]\n* [[Papiamento]]\n* [[Philippine languages]]\n* [[Portu\u00f1ol]]\n* [[Spanglish]]\n* [[Spanish-based creole languages]]\n* [[List of English words of Spanish origin]]\n{{col-break}}\n; [[Spanish dialects and varieties]]\n* '''European Spanish'''\n** [[Peninsular Spanish]]\n*** [[Andalusian Spanish]]\n*** [[Castilian Spanish]]\n*** [[Castrapo]] (Galician Spanish)\n*** [[Cast\u00fao]] (Extremaduran Spanish)\n*** [[Murcian Spanish]]\n** Insular Spanish\n*** [[Canarian Spanish]]\n* '''[[Spanish language in the Americas|Spanish in the Americas]]'''\n** [[North American Spanish]]\n** [[Central American Spanish]]\n** [[Caribbean Spanish]]\n** [[Spanish language in South America|South American Spanish]]\n** [[Spanish language in the United States|Spanish in the United States]]\n* '''Spanish in Africa'''\n** [[Equatoguinean Spanish]]\n** [[Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic]]\n* '''Spanish in Asia'''\n** [[Spanish language in the Philippines|Spanish in the Philippines]]<ref>A First Spanish Reader, by Erwin W.

According to the [[Royal Spanish Academy]], \"espa\u00f1ol\" (Spanish) derives from the [[Proven\u00e7al dialect|Proven\u00e7al]] word ''espaignol'' and that, in turn, derives from the [[Medieval Latin]] word ''Hispaniolus'', which means \"from \u2014or pertaining to\u2014 [[Hispania]]\". The Latin form {{smallcaps|<small>H\u012cSP\u0100N\u012cOLUS</small>}} comes from the Latin name of the province of [[Hispania|<small>H\u012cSP\u0100N\u012cA</small>]] that included the current territory of the [[Iberian Peninsula]]. In late Latin, the /<small>H</small>/ was silent and /<small>\u012c</small>/ evolved into a short /e/, resulting in the word <small>ESPA\u0147OL(U)</small>.\n\nThere are other hypotheses apart from the one suggested by the Royal Spanish Academy. Some [[Philology|philologists]] argue that \"espa\u00f1ol\" comes from [[Occitan language|Occitan]] ''espaignon''. On the other hand, Spanish philologist [[Ram\u00f3n Men\u00e9ndez Pidal|Men\u00e9ndez Pidal]] suggested that the classic ''hispanus'' or ''hispanicus'' took the suffix ''-one'' from [[Vulgar Latin]], as it happened with other words such as ''bret\u00f3n'' (Breton) or ''saj\u00f3n'' (Saxon). The term ''hispanione'' evolved into the [[Old Spanish language|Old Spanish]] ''espa\u00f1\u00f3n'', which eventually, became ''espa\u00f1ol''.{{citation needed|date=January 2020}}\n\n== History ==\n{{Main|History of the Spanish language}}\n\n[[File:CartulariosValpuesta.jpg|right|thumb|The Visigothic [[Cartularies of Valpuesta]], written in a late form of Latin, were declared in 2010 by the Spanish Royal Academy as the record of the earliest words written in Castilian, predating those of the [[Glosas Emilianenses]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.euskonews.com/udalak/valpuesta/cartularioshistoria.htm|title=cartularioshistoria|website=www.euskonews.com|access-date=22 September 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160402124945/http://www.euskonews.com/udalak/valpuesta/cartularioshistoria.htm|archive-date=2 April 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref>]]\n\nThe Spanish language evolved from [[Vulgar Latin]], which was brought to the [[Iberian Peninsula]] by the [[Roman Republic|Romans]] during the [[Second Punic War]], beginning in 210 BC. Previously, several pre-Roman languages (also called [[Paleohispanic languages]])\u2014some related to Latin via Indo-European, and some that are not related at all\u2014were spoken in the Iberian Peninsula. These languages included [[Basque language|Basque]] (still spoken today), [[Iberian language|Iberian]], [[Celtiberian language|Celtiberian]] and [[Gallaecian language|Gallaecian]].\n\nThe first documents to show traces of what is today regarded as the precursor of modern Spanish are from the 9th century. Throughout the [[Middle Ages]] and into the [[modern era]], the most important influences on the Spanish lexicon came from neighboring [[Romance languages]]\u2014[[Mozarabic language|Mozarabic]] ([[Andalusi Romance]]), [[Navarro-Aragonese]], [[Leonese language|Leonese]], [[Catalan language|Catalan]], [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], [[Galician language|Galician]], [[Occitan language|Occitan]], and later, [[French language|French]] and [[Italian language|Italian]]. Spanish also borrowed a considerable number of words from [[Arabic language|Arabic]], as well as a minor influence from the Germanic [[Gothic language]] through the migration of tribes and a period of [[Visigoth]] rule in Iberia. In addition, many more words were borrowed from [[Latin language|Latin]] through the influence of written language and the liturgical language of the Church. The loanwords were taken from both [[Classical Latin]] and [[Renaissance Latin]], the form of Latin in use at that time.\n\nAccording to the theories of [[Ram\u00f3n Men\u00e9ndez Pidal]], local [[sociolect]]s of Vulgar Latin evolved into Spanish, in the north of Iberia, in an area centered in the city of [[Burgos]], and this dialect was later brought to the city of [[Toledo (Spain)|Toledo]], where the written standard of Spanish was first developed, in the 13th century.<ref name=Penny1>{{cite book |title= A History Of The Spanish Language|last=Penny|first= Ralph|authorlink= |year= 2002|publisher=Cambridge University Press |edition= 2|pages= 20\u201321}}</ref> In this formative stage, Spanish developed a strongly differing variant from its close cousin, [[Leonese Language|Leonese]], and, according to some authors, was distinguished by a heavy Basque influence (see [[Iberian Romance languages]]). This distinctive dialect spread to southern Spain with the advance of the {{lang|es|[[Reconquista]]}}, and meanwhile gathered a sizable lexical influence from the [[Arabic language|Arabic]] of [[Al-Andalus]], much of it indirectly, through the Romance [[Mozarabic language|Mozarabic dialects]] (some 4,000 [[Arabic language|Arabic]]-derived words, make up around 8% of the language today).<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1O29-SPANISH.html|title=Concise Oxford Companion to the English Language|publisher=Oxford University Press|date=|accessdate=24 July 2008}}</ref> The written standard for this new language was developed in the cities of [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]], in the 13th to 16th centuries, and [[Madrid]], from the 1570s.<ref name=Penny1 />\n\nThe development of the [[Spanish phonology|Spanish sound system]] from that of [[Vulgar Latin]] exhibits most of the changes that are typical of [[Western Romance languages]], including [[lenition]] of intervocalic consonants (thus Latin {{lang|la|{{smallcaps|v\u012bta}}}} > Spanish {{lang|es|vida}}).

For details on borrowed words and other external influences upon Spanish, see [[Influences on the Spanish language]].\n\n== Grammar ==\n{{Main|Spanish grammar}}\n[[File:Cervantes J\u00e1uregui.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Miguel de Cervantes]], considered by many the greatest author of Spanish literature, and author of ''[[Don Quixote]]'', widely considered the first modern European novel.]]\n\nMost of the grammatical and [[Linguistic typology|typological]] features of Spanish are shared with the other [[Romance languages]]. Spanish is a [[fusional language]]. The [[Spanish nouns|noun]] and [[Spanish adjectives|adjective]] systems exhibit two [[Grammatical gender|genders]] and two [[Grammatical number|numbers]]. In addition, articles and some [[Spanish pronouns|pronouns]] and [[Spanish determiners|determiners]] have a neuter gender in their singular form. There are about fifty [[Grammatical conjugation|conjugated]] forms per [[verb]], with 3 tenses: past, present, future; 2 aspects for past: perfective, imperfective; 4 moods: indicative, subjunctive, conditional, imperative; 3 persons: first, second, third; 2 numbers: singular, plural; 3 [[verboid]] forms: infinitive, gerund, and past participle. Verbs express [[T-V distinction]] by using different persons for formal and informal addresses. (For a detailed overview of verbs, see [[Spanish verbs]] and [[Spanish irregular verbs]].)\n\nSpanish [[syntax]] is considered [[Branching (linguistics)|right-branching]], meaning that subordinate or [[Grammatical modifier|modifying]] [[Constituent (linguistics)|constituents]] tend to be placed after their head words. The language uses [[Preposition and postposition|prepositions]] (rather than postpositions or inflection of nouns for [[Grammatical case|case]]), and usually\u2014though not always\u2014places [[adjective]]s after [[noun]]s, as do most other Romance languages.\n\nThe language is classified as a [[subject\u2013verb\u2013object]] language; however, as in most Romance languages, constituent order is highly variable and governed mainly by [[topicalization]] and [[Focus (linguistics)|focus]] rather than by syntax. It is a \"[[Pro-drop language|pro-drop]]\", or \"[[Null-subject language|null-subject]]\" language\u2014that is, it allows the deletion of subject pronouns when they are [[Pragmatics|pragmatically]] unnecessary. Spanish is described as a \"[[Verb framing|verb-framed]]\" language, meaning that the ''direction'' of motion is expressed in the verb while the ''mode'' of locomotion is expressed adverbially (e.g. ''subir corriendo'' or ''salir volando''; the respective English equivalents of these examples\u2014'to run up' and 'to fly out'\u2014show that English is, by contrast, \"satellite-framed\", with mode of locomotion expressed in the verb and direction in an adverbial modifier).\n\nSubject/verb inversion is not required in questions, and thus the recognition of declarative or interrogative may depend entirely on intonation.\n\n== Phonology ==\n{{IPA notice}}\n[[File:Miguel Hache - voice.ogg|thumb|Spanish spoken in Spain]]\n{{Main|Spanish phonology}}\n\nThe Spanish phonemic system is originally descended from that of [[Vulgar Latin]]. Its development exhibits some traits in common with the neighboring dialects\u2014especially [[Leonese dialect|Leonese]] and [[Aragonese language|Aragonese]]\u2014as well as other traits unique to [[Castilian Spanish|Castilian]]. Castilian is unique among its neighbors in the aspiration and eventual loss of the Latin initial {{IPA|/f/}} sound (e.g. Cast. {{lang|es|harina}} vs. Leon. and Arag. {{lang|ast|farina}}).<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Zamora Vicente|1967|pp=117 and 222}}</ref> The Latin initial consonant sequences {{lang|la|pl-}}, {{lang|la|cl-}}, and {{lang|la|fl-}} in Spanish typically become {{lang|es|ll-}} (originally pronounced {{IPA|[\u028e]}}), while in Aragonese they are preserved, and in Leonese they present a variety of outcomes, including {{IPA|[t\u0283]}}, {{IPA|[\u0283]}}, and {{IPA|[\u028e]}}. Where Latin had {{lang|la|-li-}} before a vowel (e.g. {{lang|la|filius}}) or the ending {{lang|la|-iculus}}, {{lang|la|-icula}} (e.g. {{lang|la|auricula}}), Old Spanish produced {{IPA|[\u0292]}}, that in Modern Spanish became the velar fricative {{IPA|[x]}} ({{lang|es|hijo}}, {{lang|es|oreja}}, where neighboring languages have the palatal lateral {{IPA|[\u028e]}} (e.g. Portuguese {{lang|pt|filho}}, {{lang|pt|orelha}}; Catalan {{lang|ca|fill}}, {{lang|ca|orella}}).\n\n=== Segmental phonology ===\n[[File:Spanish vowel chart.svg|thumb|upright=1.15|Spanish vowel chart, from {{Harvcoltxt|Ladefoged|Johnson|2010|p=227}}]]\nThe Spanish [[Phoneme|phonemic]] inventory consists of five vowel phonemes ({{IPA|/a/}}, {{IPA|/e/}}, {{IPA|/i/}}, {{IPA|/o/}}, {{IPA|/u/}}) and 17 to 19 consonant phonemes (the exact number depending on the dialect<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Hualde|2014|p=39}}</ref>). The main [[Allophone|allophonic]] variation among vowels is the reduction of the high vowels {{IPA|/i/}} and {{IPA|/u/}} to glides\u2014{{IPA|[j]}} and {{IPA|[w]}} respectively\u2014when unstressed and adjacent to another vowel. Some instances of the mid vowels {{IPA|/e/}} and {{IPA|/o/}}, determined lexically, alternate with the diphthongs {{IPA|/je/}} and {{IPA|/we/}} respectively when stressed, in a process that is better described as [[Morphophonology|morphophonemic]] rather than phonological, as it is not predictable from phonology alone.\n\nThe Spanish consonant system is characterized by (1) three [[nasal stop|nasal]] phonemes, and one or two (depending on the dialect) [[lateral consonant|lateral]] phoneme(s), which in syllable-final position [[Archiphonemic|lose their contrast]] and are subject to [[Assimilation (linguistics)|assimilation]] to a following consonant; (2) three [[Voicelessness|voiceless]] [[Plosive|stops]] and the [[Affricate consonant|affricate]] {{IPA|/t\u0283/}}; (3) three or four (depending on the dialect) [[Voicelessness|voiceless]] [[Fricative consonant|fricatives]]; (4) a set of voiced [[obstruent]]s\u2014{{IPA|/b/}}, {{IPA|/d/}}, {{IPA|/\u0261/}}, and sometimes {{IPA|/\u029d/}}\u2014which alternate between [[Approximant consonant|approximant]] and [[plosive]] allophones depending on the environment; and (5) a phonemic distinction between the \"[[Flap consonant|tapped]]\" and \"[[Trill consonant|trilled]]\" ''r''-sounds (single {{angle bracket|r}} and double {{angle bracket|rr}} in orthography).\n\nIn the following table of consonant phonemes, {{IPA|/\u028e/}} is marked with an asterisk (*) to indicate that it is preserved only in some dialects. In most dialects it has been merged with {{IPA|/\u029d/}} in the merger called {{lang|es|[[ye\u00edsmo]]}}. Similarly, {{IPA|/\u03b8/}} is also marked with an asterisk to indicate that most dialects do not distinguish it from {{IPA|/s/}} (see {{lang|es|[[seseo]]}}), although this is not a true merger but an outcome of different evolution of sibilants in Southern Spain.\n\nThe phoneme {{IPA|/\u0283/}} is in parentheses () to indicate that it appears only in [[loanwords]]. Each of the voiced obstruent phonemes {{IPA|/b/}}, {{IPA|/d/}}, {{IPA|/\u029d/}}, and {{IPA|/\u0261/}} appears to the right of a ''pair'' of voiceless phonemes, to indicate that, while the ''voiceless'' phonemes maintain a phonemic contrast between plosive (or affricate) and fricative, the ''voiced'' ones alternate [[Allophone|allophonically]] (i.e. without phonemic contrast) between plosive and approximant pronunciations.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin: 1em auto 1em auto; text-align: center;\"\n|+ Consonant phonemes<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Mart\u00ednez-Celdr\u00e1n|Fern\u00e1ndez-Planas|Carrera-Sabat\u00e9|2003|p=255}}</ref>\n|-\n!\n! colspan=2 | [[Labial consonant|Labial]]\n! colspan=2 | [[Dental consonant|Dental]]\n! colspan=2 | [[Alveolar consonant|Alveolar]]\n! colspan=2 | [[Palatal consonant|Palatal]]\n! colspan=2 | [[Velar consonant|Velar]]\n|-\n!

The ''tendencies'' of stress assignment are as follows:<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Eddington|2000|p=96}}</ref>\n* In words that end with a vowel, stress most often falls on the penultimate syllable.\n* In words that end with a consonant, stress most often falls on the last syllable, with the following exceptions: The grammatical endings {{lang|es|-n}} (for third-person-plural of verbs) and {{lang|es|-s}} (whether for plural of nouns and adjectives or for second-person-singular of verbs) do not change the location of stress. Thus, regular ''verbs'' ending with {{lang|es|-n}} and the great majority of words ending with {{lang|es|-s}} are stressed on the penult. Although a significant number of nouns and adjectives ending with {{lang|es|-n}} are also stressed on the penult ({{lang|es|joven}}, {{lang|es|virgen}}, {{lang|es|mitin}}), the great majority of nouns and adjectives ending with {{lang|es|-n}} are stressed on their last syllable ({{lang|es|capit\u00e1n}}, {{lang|es|almac\u00e9n}}, {{lang|es|jard\u00edn}}, {{lang|es|coraz\u00f3n}}).\n* Preantepenultimate stress (stress on the fourth-to-last syllable) occurs rarely, only on verbs with [[clitic]] pronouns attached ({{lang|es|guard\u00e1ndoselos}} 'saving them for him/her/them/you').\n\nIn addition to the many exceptions to these tendencies, there are numerous [[minimal pair]]s that contrast solely on stress such as {{lang|es|s\u00e1bana}} ('sheet') and {{lang|es|sabana}} ('savannah'); {{lang|es|l\u00edmite}} ('boundary'), {{lang|es|limite}} ('[that] he/she limits') and {{lang|es|limit\u00e9}} ('I limited'); {{lang|es|l\u00edquido}} ('liquid'), {{lang|es|liquido}} ('I sell off') and {{lang|es|liquid\u00f3}} ('he/she sold off').\n\nThe orthographic system unambiguously reflects where the stress occurs: in the absence of an accent mark, the stress falls on the last syllable unless the last letter is {{angle bracket|n}}, {{angle bracket|s}}, or a vowel, in which cases the stress falls on the next-to-last (penultimate) syllable. Exceptions to those rules are indicated by an acute accent mark over the vowel of the stressed syllable.

The variant is very similar to Mexican Spanish, because of Mexican and Latin American emigration to the Spanish East Indies over the years. \nFrom 1565 to 1821, the Philippines, which were a part of the Spanish East Indies, were governed by the Captaincy General of the Philippines as a territory of the Viceroyalty of New Spain centered in Mexico. It was only administered directly from Spain in 1821 after Mexico gained its independence that same year. Since the Philippines was a former territory of the Viceroyalty of New Spain for most of the Spanish colonial period, Spanish as was spoken in the Philippines had a greater affinity to American Spanish rather than to Peninsular Spanish. \n\n====Chavacano====\n{{main article|Chavacano}}\nChavacano or Chabacano [t\u0283a\u03b2a\u02c8kano] is a group of Spanish-based creole language varieties spoken in the Philippines.

the main dialects of Spanish.]]\n{{Main|Spanish dialects and varieties}}\nThere are important variations ([[Phonology|phonological]], [[Grammar|grammatical]], and [[Lexicon|lexical]]) in the spoken Spanish of the various regions of Spain and throughout the Spanish-speaking areas of the Americas.\n\nThe variety with the most speakers is [[Mexican Spanish]]. It is spoken by more than twenty percent of the world's Spanish speakers (more than 112 million of the total of more than 500 million, according to the table above). One of its main features is the [[vowel reduction|reduction]] or loss of [[unstressed vowel]]s, mainly when they are in contact with the sound /s/.<ref>Eleanor Greet Cotton, John M. Sharp (1988) ''Spanish in the Americas, Volume 2'', pp.154\u2013155, [https://books.google.com/books?id=89KX2RC6Gx0C&pg=PA154&dq=Mexican+vowels&client=firefox-a#v=onepage&q=Mexican%20vowels&f=false URL]</ref><ref>Lope Blanch, Juan M.

Even so, the speech of Madrid, which has typically southern features such as [[ye\u00edsmo]] and s-aspiration, is the standard variety for use on radio and television.<ref>{{cite book |title=Random House Unabridged Dictionary |year=2006 |publisher= Random House Inc. }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |title=The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language |year=2006 |edition=4th |publisher= Houghton Mifflin Company }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |title=Webster's Revised Unabridged Dictionary |year=1998 |publisher= MICRA, Inc. }}</ref><ref>{{cite encyclopedia|url=http://encarta.msn.com/dictionary_1861595345/Castilian.html |title=Encarta World English Dictionary |accessdate=5 August 2008 |year=2007 |publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing Plc. |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090831041048/http://encarta.msn.com/dictionary_1861595345/Castilian.html |archivedate=31 August 2009 |df= }}</ref> However, the variety used in the media is that of Madrid's educated classes, where southern traits are less evident, in contrast with the variety spoken by working-class Madrid, where those traits are pervasive. The educated variety of Madrid is indicated by many as the one that has most influenced the written standard for Spanish.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Penny |first1=Ralph |title= Variation and Change in Spanish |year= 2000 |publisher= Cambridge University Press |isbn=0-521-78045-4 |page= 199 |quote= ''whatever might be claimed by other centres, such as Valladolid, it was educated varieties of Madrid Spanish that were mostly regularly reflected in the written standard.''}}</ref>\n\n=== Phonology ===\nThe four main phonological divisions are based respectively on (1) the phoneme [[Voiceless dental fricative|{{IPA|/\u03b8/}}]] (\"theta\"), (2) the [[debuccalization]] of syllable-final {{IPA|/s/}}, (3) the sound of the spelled {{angle bracket|s}}, (4) and the phoneme [[Palatal lateral approximant|{{IPA|/\u028e/}}]] (\"turned ''y''\"),<ref>The [[International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]] symbol \"turned ''y''\" (\u028e), with its \"tail\" leaning to the right, resembles, but is technically different from, the Greek letter lambda (\u03bb), whose tail leans to the left.</ref>\n* The phoneme {{IPA|/\u03b8/}} (spelled {{lang|es|c}} before {{lang|es|e}} or {{lang|es|i}} and spelled {{angle bracket|z}} elsewhere), a [[voiceless dental fricative]] as in English '''''th'''ing'', is maintained by a majority of Spain's population, especially in the northern and central parts of the country. In other areas (some parts of southern Spain, the [[Canary Islands]], and the Americas), {{IPA|/\u03b8/}} doesn't exist and {{IPA|/s/}} occurs instead. The maintenance of phonemic contrast is called {{lang|es|[[distinci\u00f3n]]}} in Spanish, while the merger is generally called {{lang|es|[[seseo]]}} (in reference to the usual realization of the merged phoneme as {{IPA|[s]}}) or, occasionally, {{lang|es|[[ceceo]]}} (referring to its interdental realization, {{IPA|[\u03b8]}}, in some parts of southern Spain). In most of Hispanic America, the spelled {{angle bracket|c}} before {{angle bracket|e}} or {{angle bracket|i}}, and spelled {{angle bracket|z}} is always pronounced as a [[Voiceless alveolar sibilant#Dentalized laminal alveolar|voiceless dental sibilant]].\n* The debuccalization (pronunciation as {{IPA|[h]}}, or loss) of syllable-final {{IPA|/s/}} is associated with the southern half of Spain and lowland Americas: Central America (except central Costa Rica and Guatemala), the Caribbean, coastal areas of southern Mexico, and South America except Andean highlands. Debuccalization is frequently called \"aspiration\" in English, and {{lang|es|aspiraci\u00f3n}} in Spanish. When there is no debuccalization, the syllable-final {{IPA|/s/}} is pronounced as [[Voiceless alveolar sibilant#Retracted alveolar|voiceless \"apico-alveolar\" sibilant]] or as a [[Voiceless alveolar sibilant#Dentalized laminal alveolar|voiceless dental sibilant]] in the same fashion as in the next paragraph.\n* The sound that corresponds to the letter {{angle bracket|s}} is pronounced in northern and central Spain as a [[Voiceless alveolar sibilant#Retracted alveolar|voiceless \"apico-alveolar\" sibilant]] {{IPA|[s\u033a]}} (also described acoustically as \"[[Grave and acute|grave]]\" and articulatorily as \"retracted\"), with a weak \"hushing\" sound reminiscent of {{lcons|retroflex}} fricatives. In [[Andalusia]], [[Canary Islands]] and most of Hispanic America (except in the [[Colombian Spanish#Paisa dialect|Paisa region]] of Colombia) it is pronounced as a [[Voiceless alveolar sibilant#Dentalized laminal alveolar|voiceless dental sibilant]] {{IPA|[s]}}, much like the most frequent pronunciation of the /s/ of English. Because /s/ is one of the most frequent phonemes in Spanish, the difference of pronunciation is one of the first to be noted by a Spanish-speaking person to differentiate Spaniards from Spanish-speakers of the Americas.{{Citation needed|date=June 2017}}\n* The phoneme {{IPA|/\u028e/}} spelled {{angle bracket|ll}}, [[Palatal lateral approximant|palatal lateral]] consonant sometimes compared in sound to the sound of the {{angle bracket|lli}} of English ''million'', tends to be maintained in less-urbanized areas of northern Spain and in [[Andean Spanish|highland areas of South America]]. Meanwhile, in the speech of most other Spanish-speakers, it is merged with {{IPA|/\u029d/}} (\"curly-tail ''j''\"), a non-lateral, usually voiced, usually fricative, palatal consonant, sometimes compared to English {{IPA|/j/}} (''yod'') as in '''''y'''acht'' and spelled {{angle bracket|y}} in Spanish. As with other forms of allophony across world languages, the small difference of the spelled {{angle bracket|ll}} and the spelled {{angle bracket|y}} is usually not perceived (the difference is not heard) by people who do not produce them as different phonemes. Such a phonemic merger is called {{lang|es|[[ye\u00edsmo]]}} in Spanish. In [[Rioplatense Spanish]], the merged phoneme is generally pronounced as a postalveolar fricative, either voiced {{IPA|[\u0292]}} (as in English ''measure'' or the French {{angle bracket|j}}) in the central and western parts of the dialectal region ({{lang|es|zhe\u00edsmo}}), or voiceless {{IPA|[\u0283]}} (as in the French {{angle bracket|ch}} or Portuguese {{angle bracket|x}}) in and around Buenos Aires and Montevideo ({{lang|es|she\u00edsmo}}).<ref>Charles B.

The use of {{lang|es|vos}} (and/or its verb forms) is called {{lang|es|[[voseo]]}}. In a few dialects, all three pronouns are used, with {{lang|es|usted}}, {{lang|es|t\u00fa}}, and {{lang|es|vos}} denoting respectively formality, familiarity, and intimacy.<ref name=\"rae.es site\">{{cite web|url=http://buscon.rae.es/dpdI/ |title=Real Academia Espa\u00f1ola |language= es |publisher=Buscon.rae.es |date= |accessdate=21 April 2010}}</ref>\n\nIn {{lang|es|voseo}}, {{lang|es|vos}} is the [[Subject (grammar)|subject]] form ({{lang|es|vos dec\u00eds}}, \"you say\") and the form for the object of a [[Preposition and postposition|preposition]] ({{lang|es|voy con vos}}, \"I am going with you\"), while the direct and indirect [[Object (grammar)|object]] forms, and the [[Possessive adjective|possessives]], are the same as those associated with {{lang|es|t\u00fa}}: {{lang|es|Vos sab\u00e9s que tus amigos te respetan}} (\"You know your friends respect you\").\n\nThe verb forms of ''general voseo'' are the same as those used with {{lang|es|t\u00fa}} except in the present [[grammatical tense|tense]] ([[indicative]] and [[imperative mood|imperative]]) verbs. The forms for {{lang|es|vos}} generally can be derived from those of {{lang|es|vosotros}} (the traditional second-person familiar ''plural'') by deleting the [[semivowel|glide]] {{IPA|[i\u032f]}}, or {{IPA|/d/}}, where it appears in the ending: {{lang|es|vosotros pens\u00e1'''i'''s}} > {{lang|es|vos pens\u00e1s}}; {{lang|es|vosotros volv\u00e9'''i'''s}} > {{lang|es|vos volv\u00e9s}}, {{lang|es|pensa'''d'''!}} ({{lang|es|vosotros}}) > {{lang|es|pens\u00e1!}} ({{lang|es|vos}}), {{lang|es|volve'''d'''!}} ({{lang|es|vosotros}}) > {{lang|es|volv\u00e9!}} ({{lang|es|vos}}) .\n{| cellpadding=\"5\" class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ General voseo <small>([[Rioplatense Spanish|River Plate Spanish]])</small>\n! colspan=\"5\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|Indicative\n! colspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|Subjunctive\n! rowspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|Imperative\n|-\n!

Generally, it can be said that there are zones of exclusive use of {{lang|es|tuteo}} (the use of {{lang|es|t\u00fa}}) in the following areas: almost all of [[Mexico]], the West Indies, [[Panama]], most of [[Colombia]], [[Peru]], [[Venezuela]] and coastal [[Ecuador]].\n\n{{lang|es|Tuteo}} as a cultured form alternates with {{lang|es|voseo}} as a popular or rural form in [[Bolivia]], in the north and south of Peru, in Andean Ecuador, in small zones of the Venezuelan Andes (and most notably in the Venezuelan state of [[Zulia]]), and in a large part of Colombia. Some researchers maintain that {{lang|es|voseo}} can be heard in some parts of eastern Cuba, and others assert that it is absent from the island.<ref>Katia Salamanca de Abreu, [http://cvc.cervantes.es/lengua/thesaurus/pdf/28/TH_28_001_138_0.pdf review of Humberto L\u00f3pez Morales, ''Estudios sobre el espa\u00f1ol de Cuba''] (New York: Editorial Las Am\u00e9ricas, 1970), in ''Thesaurus'', 28 (1973), 138\u2013146.</ref>\n\n{{lang|es|Tuteo}} exists as the second-person usage with an intermediate degree of formality alongside the more familiar {{lang|es|voseo}} in [[Chile]], in the Venezuelan state of [[Zulia]], on the Caribbean coast of [[Colombia]], in the [[Azuero Peninsula]] in Panama, in the Mexican state of [[Chiapas]], and in parts of Guatemala.\n\nAreas of generalized {{lang|es|voseo}} include [[Argentina]], [[Nicaragua]], eastern [[Bolivia]], [[El Salvador]], [[Guatemala]], [[Honduras]], [[Costa Rica]], [[Paraguay]], [[Uruguay]] and the Colombian departments of [[Antioquia Department|Antioquia]], [[Caldas Department|Caldas]], [[Risaralda Department|Risaralda]], [[Quindio]] and [[Valle del Cauca]].<ref name=\"rae.es site\" />\n\n==== Ustedes ====\n{{lang|es|Ustedes}} functions as formal and informal second person plural in over 90% of the Spanish-speaking world, including all of Hispanic America, the [[Canary Islands]], and some regions of [[Andalusia]]. In [[Seville]], [[Huelva]], [[Cadiz]], and other parts of western [[Andalusia]], the familiar form is constructed as {{lang|es|ustedes vais}}, using the traditional second-person plural form of the verb. Most of Spain maintains the [[T-V distinction|formal/familiar distinction]] with {{lang|es|ustedes}} and {{lang|es|vosotros}} respectively.\n\n==== Usted ====\n{{lang|es|Usted}} is the usual second-person singular pronoun in a formal context, but it is used jointly with the third-person singular voice of the verb. It is used to convey respect toward someone who is a generation older or is of higher authority (\"you, sir\"/\"you, ma'am\"). It is also used in a ''familiar'' context by many speakers in Colombia and Costa Rica and in parts of Ecuador and Panama, to the exclusion of {{lang|es|t\u00fa}} or {{lang|es|vos}}. This usage is sometimes called {{lang|es|[[:es:Ustedeo|ustedeo]]}} in Spanish.\n\nIn Central America, especially in Honduras, {{lang|es|usted}} is often used as a formal pronoun to convey respect between the members of a romantic couple. {{lang|es|Usted}} is also used that way between parents and children in the Andean regions of Ecuador, Colombia and Venezuela.\n\n==== Third-person object pronouns ====\nMost speakers use (and the {{lang|es|[[Real Academia Espa\u00f1ola]]}} prefers) the pronouns {{lang|es|lo}} and {{lang|es|la}} for [[Direct object#The object in linguistics|''direct'' objects]] (masculine and feminine respectively, regardless of [[animacy]], meaning \"him\", \"her\", or \"it\"), and {{lang|es|le}} for [[Direct object#The object in linguistics|''indirect'' objects]] (regardless of [[Grammatical gender|gender]] or [[animacy]], meaning \"to him\", \"to her\", or \"to it\"). The usage is sometimes called \"etymological\", as these direct and indirect object pronouns are a continuation, respectively, of the [[Accusative case|accusative]] and [[Dative case|dative]] pronouns of Latin, the ancestor language of Spanish.\n\nDeviations from this norm (more common in Spain than in the Americas) are called \"{{lang|es|[[le\u00edsmo]]}}\", \"{{lang|es|[[lo\u00edsmo]]}}\", or \"{{lang|es|[[la\u00edsmo]]}}\", according to which respective pronoun, {{lang|es|le}}, {{lang|es|lo}}, or {{lang|es|la}}, has expanded beyond the etymological usage ({{lang|es|le}} as a direct object, or {{lang|es|lo}} or {{lang|es|la}} as an indirect object).\n\n=== Vocabulary ===\nSome words can be significantly different in different Hispanophone countries. Most Spanish speakers can recognize other Spanish forms even in places where they are not commonly used, but Spaniards generally do not recognize specifically American usages. For example, Spanish {{lang|es|mantequilla}}, {{lang|es|aguacate}} and {{lang|es|albaricoque}} (respectively, 'butter', 'avocado', 'apricot') correspond to {{lang|es|manteca}} (word used for [[lard]] in [[Peninsular Spanish]]), {{lang|es|palta}}, and {{lang|es|damasco}}, respectively, in Argentina, Chile (except {{lang|es|manteca}}), Paraguay, Peru (except {{lang|es|manteca}} and {{lang|es|damasco}}), and Uruguay.\n\n== Relation to other languages ==\n{{further|Comparison of Portuguese and Spanish}}\nSpanish is closely related to the other [[West Iberian languages|West Iberian Romance languages]], including [[Asturian language|Asturian]], [[Aragonese language|Aragonese]], [[Galician language|Galician]], [[Ladino language|Ladino]], [[Leonese Language|Leonese]], [[Mirandese language|Mirandese]] and [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]].\n\nIt is generally acknowledged that Portuguese and Spanish speakers can communicate in written form, with varying degrees of mutual intelligibility.<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Jensen|1989}}</ref><ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Penny|2000|p=14}}</ref><ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Dalby|1998|p=501}}</ref><ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Ginsburgh|Weber|2011|p=90}}</ref>\n[[Mutual intelligibility]] of the ''written'' Spanish and Portuguese languages is remarkably high, and the difficulties of the spoken forms are based more on phonology than on grammatical and lexical dissimilarities. ''[[Ethnologue]]'' gives estimates of the [[lexical similarity]] between related languages in terms of precise percentages. For Spanish and Portuguese, that figure is 89%. Italian, on the other hand its phonology similar to Spanish, but has a lower lexical similarity of 82%. Mutual intelligibility between Spanish and [[French language|French]] or between Spanish and [[Romanian language|Romanian]] is lower still, given lexical similarity ratings of 75% and 71% respectively.<ref name=\"ethnologue\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=spa|title=Spanish|work=Ethnologue}}</ref><ref name=\"ezglot\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ezglot.com/most-similar-languages.php?l=spa|title=Similar languages to Spanish|work=EZGlot}}</ref> And comprehension of Spanish by French speakers who have not studied the language is much lower, at an estimated 45%. In general, thanks to the common features of the writing systems of the Romance languages, interlingual comprehension of the written word is greater than that of oral communication.\n\nThe following table compares the forms of some common words in several Romance languages:\n<div style=\"overflow:auto;\">\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Other theories suggest, on the basis of what is used to make cheese, a derivation from Latin ''brandeum'' (originally meaning a linen covering, later a thin cloth for relic storage) through an intermediate root *''brandea''. For the development of the meaning, cf. Spanish ''manteca'', Portuguese ''manteiga'', probably from Latin ''mantica'' ('sack'), Italian ''formaggio'' and French ''fromage'' from ''formaticus''.

Therefore, its relationship to Spanish is comparable with that of the [[Yiddish language]] to [[German language|German]]. Ladino speakers today are almost exclusively [[Sephardim|Sephardi]] Jews, with family roots in Turkey, Greece, or the Balkans, and living mostly in Israel, Turkey, and the United States, with a few communities in Hispanic America.<ref name=\"Ladino\" /> Judaeo-Spanish lacks the [[Amerindian languages|Native American vocabulary]] which was acquired by standard Spanish during the [[Spanish Empire|Spanish colonial period]], and it retains many archaic features which have since been lost in standard Spanish. It contains, however, other vocabulary which is not found in standard Spanish, including vocabulary from [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]], French, Greek and [[Turkish language|Turkish]], and other languages spoken where the Sephardim settled.\n\nJudaeo-Spanish is in serious danger of extinction because many native speakers today are elderly as well as elderly ''olim'' (immigrants to [[Israel]]) who have not transmitted the language to their children or grandchildren. However, it is experiencing a minor revival among Sephardi communities, especially in music. In the case of the Latin American communities, the danger of extinction is also due to the risk of assimilation by modern Castilian.\n\nA related dialect is [[Haketia]], the Judaeo-Spanish of northern Morocco. This too tended to assimilate with modern Spanish, during the Spanish occupation of the region.\n\n== Writing system ==\n{{Main|Spanish orthography}}\n{{Spanish language}}\nSpanish is written in the [[Latin script]], with the addition of the character {{angle bracket|[[\u00f1]]}} ({{lang|es|e\u00f1e}}, representing the phoneme {{IPA|/[[Palatal nasal|\u0272]]/}}, a letter distinct from {{angle bracket|n}}, although typographically composed of an {{angle bracket|n}} with a [[tilde]]). Formerly the [[digraph (orthography)|digraphs]] {{angle bracket|ch}} ({{lang|es|che}}, representing the phoneme {{IPA|/t\u0361\u0283/}}) and {{angle bracket|ll}} ({{lang|es|elle}}, representing the phoneme {{IPA|/[[Palatal lateral approximant|\u028e]]/}}), were also considered single letters. However, the digraph {{angle bracket|rr}} ({{lang|es|erre fuerte}}, 'strong r', {{lang|es|erre doble}}, 'double r', or simply {{lang|es|erre}}), which also represents a distinct phoneme {{IPA|/r/}}, was not similarly regarded as a single letter. Since 1994 {{angle bracket|ch}} and {{angle bracket|ll}} have been treated as letter pairs for [[collation]] purposes, though they remained a part of the alphabet until 2010. Words with {{angle bracket|ch}} are now alphabetically sorted between those with {{angle bracket|cg}} and {{angle bracket|ci}}, instead of following {{angle bracket|cz}} as they used to. The situation is similar for {{angle bracket|ll}}.<ref>[http://buscon.rae.es/dpdI/SrvltConsulta?lema=ch Diccionario Panhisp\u00e1nico de Dudas], 1st ed.</ref><ref>[http://www.rae.es/ Real Academia Espa\u00f1ola], [http://www.spanishpronto.com/spanishpronto/spanishalphabet.html Explanation] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070906105503/https://www.spanishpronto.com/spanishpronto/spanishalphabet.html |date=6 September 2007 }} at [http://www.spanishpronto.com/ Spanish Pronto] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070914002335/https://www.spanishpronto.com/ |date=14 September 2007 }} {{in lang|es|en}}</ref>\n\nThus, the Spanish alphabet has the following 27 letters:\n\n:{{lang|es|A, B, C,<!-- ch considered digraph - see next references. --> D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L,<!-- ll considered digraph - see next references. --> M, N, \u00d1, O, P, Q, R, <!-- but not rr See previous paragraph. --> S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.}}\n\nSince 2010, none of the digraphs ({{lang|es|ch, ll, rr, gu, qu}}) is considered a letter by the Spanish Royal Academy.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rae.es/consultas/exclusion-de-ch-y-ll-del-abecedario|title=Exclusi\u00f3n de ch y ll del abecedario &#124; Real Academia Espa\u00f1ola|website=www.rae.es}}</ref>\n\nThe letters {{lang|es|k}} and {{lang|es|w}} are used only in words and names coming from foreign languages ({{lang|es|kilo, folklore, whisky, kiwi}}, etc.).\n\nWith the exclusion of a very small number of regional terms such as {{lang|es|[[M\u00e9xico]]}} (see [[Toponymy of Mexico#Phonetic evolution|Toponymy of Mexico]]), pronunciation can be entirely determined from spelling. Under the orthographic conventions, a typical Spanish word is stressed on the [[syllable]] before the last if it ends with a vowel (not including {{angle bracket|y}}) or with a vowel followed by {{angle bracket|n}} or an {{angle bracket|s}}; it is stressed on the last syllable otherwise. Exceptions to this rule are indicated by placing an [[acute accent]] on the [[stress (linguistics)|stressed vowel]].\n\nThe acute accent is used, in addition, to distinguish between certain [[homophone]]s, especially when one of them is a stressed word and the other one is a [[clitic]]: compare {{lang|es|el}} ('the', masculine singular definite article) with {{lang|es|\u00e9l}} ('he' or 'it'), or {{lang|es|te}} ('you', object pronoun) with {{lang|es|t\u00e9}} ('tea'), {{lang|es|de}} (preposition 'of') versus {{lang|es|d\u00e9}} ('give' [formal imperative/third-person present subjunctive]), and {{lang|es|se}} (reflexive pronoun) versus {{lang|es|s\u00e9}} ('I know' or imperative 'be').\n\nThe interrogative pronouns ({{lang|es|qu\u00e9}}, {{lang|es|cu\u00e1l}}, {{lang|es|d\u00f3nde}}, {{lang|es|qui\u00e9n}}, etc.) also receive accents in direct or indirect questions, and some demonstratives ({{lang|es|\u00e9se}}, {{lang|es|\u00e9ste}}, {{lang|es|aqu\u00e9l}}, etc.) can be accented when used as pronouns. Accent marks used to be omitted on capital letters (a widespread practice in the days of [[typewriter]]s and the early days of computers when only lowercase vowels were available with accents), although the {{lang|es|Real Academia Espa\u00f1ola}} advises against this and the orthographic conventions taught at schools enforce the use of the accent.\n\nWhen {{lang|es|u}} is written between {{lang|es|g}} and a front vowel {{lang|es|e}} or {{lang|es|i}}, it indicates a \"[[Hard and soft G|hard g]]\" pronunciation. A [[Diaeresis (diacritic)|diaeresis]] {{lang|es|\u00fc}} indicates that it is not silent as it normally would be (e.g., {{lang|es|cig\u00fce\u00f1a}}, 'stork', is pronounced {{IPA|[\u03b8i\u02c8\u0263we\u0272a]}}; if it were written *{{lang|es|cigue\u00f1a}}, it would be pronounced *{{IPA|[\u03b8i\u02c8\u0263e\u0272a]}}).\n\nInterrogative and exclamatory clauses are introduced with [[inverted question and exclamation marks]] ({{lang|es|\u00bf}} and {{lang|es|\u00a1}}, respectively).\n\n== Organizations ==\n[[File:Academia de la Lengua.jpg|thumb|The [[Real Academia Espa\u00f1ola|Royal Spanish Academy]] Headquarters in [[Madrid]], [[Spain]].]]\n\n=== Royal Spanish Academy ===\n{{main|Royal Spanish Academy}}\n[[File:Coat of Arms of the Royal Spanish Academy.svg|left|thumb|upright=0.27|Arms of the Royal Spanish Academy]]\nThe Royal Spanish Academy ({{lang-es|Real Academia Espa\u00f1ola}}), founded in 1713,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lib.uwaterloo.ca/society/history/1713rae.html |title=Scholarly Societies Project |publisher=Lib.uwaterloo.ca |date= |accessdate=6 November 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100923234545/http://www.lib.uwaterloo.ca/society/history/1713rae.html |archivedate=23 September 2010 }}</ref> together with the 21 other national ones (see [[Association of Spanish Language Academies]]), exercises a standardizing influence through its publication of dictionaries and widely respected grammar and style guides.<ref>{{cite book|last=Batchelor|first=Ronald Ernest|title=Using Spanish: a guide to contemporary usage|year=1992|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=0-521-26987-3|page=318|url=https://books.google.com/?id=eEWZL1j9ig8C&pg=PA4&dq=real+academia+espa%C3%B1ola+recognized#v=onepage&q&f=false}}</ref>\nBecause of influence and for other sociohistorical reasons, a standardized form of the language ([[Standard Spanish]]) is widely acknowledged for use in literature, academic contexts and the media.\n\n=== Association of Spanish Language Academies ===\n{{main|Association of Spanish Language Academies}}\n[[File:Pa\u00edses con academia de la lengua espa\u00f1ola.png|thumb|Countries members of the ASALE.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.asale.org/ASALE/asale.html |title=Association of Spanish Language Academies |language=Spanish |publisher=Asale |accessdate=5 February 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100923155313/http://asale.org/ASALE/asale.html |archivedate=23 September 2010 }}</ref>]]\nThe Association of Spanish Language Academies ({{lang|es|Asociaci\u00f3n de Academias de la Lengua Espa\u00f1ola}}, or {{lang|es|ASALE}}) is the entity which regulates the Spanish language.

This organization has branched out in over 20 different countries, with 75 centers devoted to the Spanish and Hispanic American cultures and Spanish language. The ultimate goals of the Institute are to promote universally the education, the study, and the use of Spanish as a second language, to support methods and activities that help the process of Spanish-language education, and to contribute to the advancement of the Spanish and Hispanic American cultures in non-Spanish-speaking countries. The Institute's 2015 report \"El espa\u00f1ol, una lengua viva\" (Spanish, a living language) estimated that there were 559 million Spanish speakers worldwide. Its latest annual report \"[https://www.cervantes.es/sobre_instituto_cervantes/prensa/2018/noticias/np_presentacion-anuario.htm El espa\u00f1ol en el mundo 2018]\" (Spanish in the world 2018) counts 577 million Spanish speakers worldwide. Among the sources cited in the report is the [[United States Census Bureau|U.S. Census Bureau]], which estimates that the U.S. will have 138 million Spanish speakers by 2050, making it the biggest Spanish-speaking nation on earth, with Spanish the mother tongue of almost a third of its citizens.<ref>Stephen Burgen, [https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/jun/29/us-second-biggest-spanish-speaking-country US now has more Spanish speakers than Spain \u2013 only Mexico has more], US News, 29 June 2015.</ref>\n\n=== Official use by international organizations ===\n{{Main|List of countries where Spanish is an official language#International organizations where Spanish is official}}\n\nSpanish is one of the official languages of the [[United Nations]], the [[European Union]], the [[World Trade Organization]], the [[Organization of American States]], the [[Organization of Ibero-American States]], the [[African Union]], the [[Union of South American Nations]], the [[Antarctic Treaty Secretariat]], the [[Latin Union]], the [[Caricom]], the [[North American Free Trade Agreement]], and numerous other international organizations.\n{{clear right}}\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Language}}\n{{col-start-fixed|width=calc(100% \u2013 256px)}}\n{{col-break}}\n* [[List of Spanish-language poets]]\n* [[Fund\u00e9u BBVA]]\n* [[Spanish as a second or foreign language]]\n\n; Spanish words and phrases\n* [[Longest word in Spanish]]\n* [[Most common words in Spanish]]\n* [[Spanish profanity]]\n* [[Spanish proverbs]]\n* [[List of English\u2013Spanish interlingual homographs]]\n* [[Cuento]]\n\n; [[Hispanosphere|Spanish-speaking world]]\n* [[List of countries where Spanish is an official language|Countries where Spanish is an official language]]\n* [[Hispanic culture]]\n* [[Hispanicization]]\n* [[Hispanidad]]\n* [[Hispanism]]\n* [[Hispanosphere]]\n* [[Panhispanism]]\n{{col-break}}\n; [[Influences on the Spanish language]]\n* [[Arabic influence on the Spanish language]]\n* [[List of Spanish words of Germanic origin]]\n* [[List of Spanish words of Nahuatl origin]]\n* [[List of Spanish words of Indigenous American Indian origin]]\n* [[List of Spanish words of Philippine origin]]\n; [[Spanish-based creole languages|Dialects and languages influenced by Spanish]]\n* [[Cal\u00f3 language|Cal\u00f3]]\n* [[Chamorro language|Chamorro]]\n* [[Chavacano]]\n* [[Frespa\u00f1ol]]\n* [[Judaeo-Spanish|Ladino]]\n* [[Llanito]]\n* [[Palenquero]]\n* [[Papiamento]]\n* [[Philippine languages]]\n* [[Portu\u00f1ol]]\n* [[Spanglish]]\n* [[Spanish-based creole languages]]\n* [[List of English words of Spanish origin]]\n{{col-break}}\n; [[Spanish dialects and varieties]]\n* '''European Spanish'''\n** [[Peninsular Spanish]]\n*** [[Andalusian Spanish]]\n*** [[Castilian Spanish]]\n*** [[Castrapo]] (Galician Spanish)\n*** [[Cast\u00fao]] (Extremaduran Spanish)\n*** [[Murcian Spanish]]\n** Insular Spanish\n*** [[Canarian Spanish]]\n* '''[[Spanish language in the Americas|Spanish in the Americas]]'''\n** [[North American Spanish]]\n** [[Central American Spanish]]\n** [[Caribbean Spanish]]\n** [[Spanish language in South America|South American Spanish]]\n** [[Spanish language in the United States|Spanish in the United States]]\n* '''Spanish in Africa'''\n** [[Equatoguinean Spanish]]\n** [[Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic]]\n* '''Spanish in Asia'''\n** [[Spanish language in the Philippines|Spanish in the Philippines]]<ref>A First Spanish Reader, by Erwin W.

Come the fall, Jack Gregson took over from Stern.\n\n===''Boxing from Ridgewood Grove'' and ''Motor City Boxing'' (1953)===\nIn February 1953, ABC premiered ''Boxing from Ridgewood Grove''. It aired on Tuesdays nights, with [[Jason Owen]] as the announcer in the first month and Bob Finnegan taking over until its cancellation in August. In March 1953, ABC brought ''Motor City Boxing'' from [[Detroit]]. The program would air for three months of Thursdays, with Don Wattrick at the providing commentary.\n\n===''Boxing from Eastern Parkway'' (1954)===\nIn May 1954, ''[[Boxing from Eastern Parkway]]'' moved from the [[DuMont Television Network]] to ABC. Tommy Logran handled the blow-by-blow commentary while occasionally being helped by Bob Finnegan and Fred Sayles. The series ended when ABC failed to renew its contract with the arena after picking up the rights to show fights at the [[International Boxing Club]].<ref name=\"BrooksMarsh2009\">{{cite book|author1=Tim Brooks|author2=Earle F.

Hodges however, left in October 1955 and Drees was the only regular announcer for the five years it stayed on ABC.\n\n===''Fight of the Week'' (1960-63)===\nAfter [[NBC]]-TV's cancellation of ''[[Gillette Cavalcade of Sports|The Gillette Cavalcade of Sports]]'' in the spring of [[1960 in television|1960]], ABC took over the [[prime time]] boxing program, although it was renamed ''[[Fight of the Week]]''. Legendary boxing commentator [[Don Dunphy]] did the blow-by-blow description of the bouts, which took place on Saturday beginning in October 1960 and running through September 1963. \n\nFrom there, the series moved to Friday nights, where it continued until ABC finally canceled prime time boxing after the bout of September 11, 1964, permanently ending 18 years of regularly scheduled prime time boxing on [[United States|U.S.]] broadcast network television. One reason for the downturn of televised boxing occurred on ''Fight of the Week'''s [[Benny Paret vs. Emile Griffith III|the March 24, 1962 broadcast]], when [[Emile Griffith]] defeated [[Benny Paret|Benny \"The Kid\" Paret]] for the Welterweight Championship at [[New York City|New York]]'s [[Madison Square Garden]]. Paret was carried from the ring unconscious, and died several days later as a result of his injuries that he had sustained in that bout.\n\n===''Wide World of Sports'' (1964-2000)===\nPrior to the advent of ''Wide World of Sports'', many major [[List of heavyweight boxing champions|heavyweight boxing title]] matches were televised via \u201c[[Closed-circuit television|closed-circuit]]\u201d (this generally meant that you had go to a movie theater to see it, pay a decent-sized amount of money to get it, and then watch it on a giant screen). Often, ''Wide World of Sports'' would show full-length replays of the fights a week or two later; these replays were usually called by [[Howard Cosell]], who became one of the best-known (and possibly most controversial) sportscaster in American television history.\n\n[[Jerry Quarry]] retired for over two and a half years after his 1975 fight with [[Ken Norton]] fight. At around this time, Quarry signed a contract with ABC to be a boxing commentator. Quarry was very popular in this position, drawing the ire of Howard Cosell, an ABC commentator being pushed out of some work by Quarry. In mid-1977, a return match was being put together which would put Quarry in against a ranked heavyweight. The ranked heavyweight would be Italian Lorenzo Zanon. The match was to be televised on ABC, where Quarry was contracted. But both fighters signed to have the bout televised on [[Boxing on CBS|CBS]]. When Quarry, who often negotiated his own fight contracts, signed the bout to CBS, he lost his ABC contract. \n\nIn 1976, ABC made a deal with promoter [[Don King (boxing promoter)|Don King]] and [[The Ring (magazine)|''The Ring'' magazine]] to stage a tournament<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.si.com/more-sports/2014/10/31/al-michaels-howard-cosell-you-cant-make-excerpt|title=Book excerpt: Al Michaels reflects on his time with Howard Cosell|last=Michaels, Wertheim|first=Al, L.

In 1986, after Cosell's retirement, Wallau became ABC's [[boxing]] analyst.  He was honored by the [[Boxing Writers Association of America]] as the top television boxing journalist in his first year.\n\n=====[[Howard Cosell]]=====\nCosell rose to prominence in the early 1960s, covering boxer [[Muhammad Ali]], beginning from the time he fought under his [[Name at birth|birth name]], Cassius Clay. The two seemed to have an affinity despite their different personalities, and complemented each other in broadcasts. Cosell was one of the first sportscasters to refer to the boxer as Muhammad Ali after he changed his name, and supported him when he refused to be inducted into the military. Cosell called most of Ali's fights immediately before and after the boxer returned from his three-year exile in October 1970. Those fights were broadcast on taped delay usually a week after they were transmitted on closed circuit. However, Cosell did not call two of Ali's biggest fights, the [[Rumble in the Jungle]] in October 1974 and the first [[Fight of the Century|Ali\u2013Joe Frazier bout]] in March 1971. Promoter [[Jerry Perenchio]] selected actor [[Burt Lancaster]], who had never provided color commentary for a fight, to work the bout with longtime announcer [[Don Dunphy]] and former light-heavyweight champion [[Archie Moore]]. Cosell attended that fight as a spectator only. He would do a voiceover of that bout, when it was shown on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] a few days before the second [[Muhammad Ali vs. Joe Frazier II|Ali-Frazier bout]] in January 1974.\n\nPerhaps his most famous call took place in the [[George Foreman#The Sunshine Showdown vs. Joe Frazier|fight]] between [[Joe Frazier]] and [[George Foreman]] for the World Heavyweight Championship in [[Kingston, Jamaica]] in 1973. When Foreman knocked Frazier to the mat the first of six times, roughly two minutes into the first round, Cosell yelled out:\n\n{{quote|Down Goes Frazier! Down Goes Frazier! Down Goes Frazier!}}\n\nHis call of Frazier's first trip to the mat became one of the most quoted phrases in American sports broadcasting history. Foreman beat Frazier by a TKO in the second round to win the [[World heavyweight boxing championship|World Heavyweight Championship]].\n\nCosell provided blow-by-blow commentary for ABC of some of boxing's biggest matches during the 1970s and the early 1980s, including [[Ken Norton]]'s upset win over Ali in 1973 and Ali's defeat of [[Leon Spinks]] in 1978 recapturing the Heavyweight title for the third time. His signature [[toupee]] was unceremoniously knocked off in front of live ABC cameras when a scuffle broke out after a broadcast match between [[Scott LeDoux]] and Johnny Boudreaux. Cosell quickly retrieved his hairpiece and replaced it. During interviews in studio with Ali, the champion would tease and threaten to remove the hairpiece with Cosell playing along but never allowing it to be touched. On one of these occasions, Ali quipped, \"Cosell, you're a phony, and that thing on your head comes from the tail of a pony.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5294873|title=Ali and Cosell, Irresistible Enigmas}}</ref>\n\nWith typical headline generating drama, Cosell abruptly ended his broadcast association with the sport of boxing while providing coverage for ABC for the heavyweight championship bout between [[Larry Holmes]] and [[Randall \"Tex\" Cobb]] on November 26, 1982<ref>{{cite book |last=Bloom |first=John|date= |title=There You Have it: The Life, Legacy, and Legend of Howard Cosell|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pRirlKfG3J0C&pg=PA153&dq=ABC+Sports+Boxing&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjOhp6EkozkAhULEawKHYzfBE44KBDoATACegQIBBAC#v=onepage&q=ABC%20Sports%20Boxing&f=false|location= |publisher=Univ of Massachusetts Press|page=153|isbn= |author-link=}}</ref>. Halfway through the bout and with Cobb absorbing a beating, Cosell stopped providing anything more than rudimentary comments about round number and the participants punctuated with occasional declarations of disgust during the 15 rounds. He declared shortly after the fight to a national television audience that he had broadcast his last professional boxing match.\n\nIn the [[Boxing at the 1976 Summer Olympics|1976 Summer Games in Montreal]], and the [[Boxing at the 1984 Summer Olympics|1984 games in Los Angeles]], Cosell was the main voice for boxing. [[Sugar Ray Leonard]] won the gold medal in his light welterweight class at Montreal, beginning his meteoric rise to a world professional title a few years later, and Cosell became close to Leonard, during this period, announcing many of his fights.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">\"I Never Played The Game\", by Howard Cosell, 1985</ref>\n\n===Cancelled 2007 card===\n{{see also|Boxing on ESPN}}\n\nSeven years after ABC's last boxing card, they were scheduled to broadcast a card from [[Boardwalk Hall]] in [[Atlantic City, New Jersey]] on April 22, 2007. The card would've featured former light heavyweight champion [[Antonio Tarver]] facing off against [[Elvir Muriqi]]. Promoter Joe DeGuardia of Star Boxing had been working on the [[Brokered programming|time buy]] deal (in other words, DeGuardia was not paid a licensing fee by ABC, but rather bought an hour of time from the network). The production would've been handled by ABC's sister company, [[ESPN]] with ''[[Friday Night Fights]]'' commentators [[Joe Tessitore]] and [[Teddy Atlas]]. The bout was ultimately scrapped<ref>{{cite web |url=https://tss.ib.tv/boxing/articles-of-2007/5142-antonio-tarver-master-of-second-chances|title=Antonio Tarver: Master Of Second Chances|last=Keenan|first=Ronan|date=June 4, 2007|website=The Sweet Science|publisher= |access-date= |quote=}}</ref> amid rumors that Tarver would not be able to make the 175 pound weight limit.\n\n===''Premier Boxing Champions'' (2015)===\nOn March 19, 2015, ESPN announced that ''Friday Night Fights'' would air for the final time on May 22, 2015, covering the finals of the 2015 Boxcino tournament.

Hodges however, left in October 1955 and Drees was the only regular announcer for the five years it stayed on ABC.\n\n===''Fight of the Week'' (1960-63)===\nAfter [[NBC]]-TV's cancellation of ''[[Gillette Cavalcade of Sports|The Gillette Cavalcade of Sports]]'' in the spring of [[1960 in television|1960]], ABC took over the [[prime time]] boxing program, although it was renamed ''[[Fight of the Week]]''. Legendary boxing commentator [[Don Dunphy]] did the blow-by-blow description of the bouts, which took place on Saturday beginning in October 1960 and running through September 1963. \n\nFrom there, the series moved to Friday nights, where it continued until ABC finally canceled prime time boxing after the bout of September 11, 1964, permanently ending 18 years of regularly scheduled prime time boxing on [[United States|U.S.]] broadcast network television. One reason for the downturn of televised boxing occurred on ''Fight of the Week'''s [[Benny Paret vs. Emile Griffith III|the March 24, 1962 broadcast]], when [[Emile Griffith]] defeated [[Benny Paret|Benny \"The Kid\" Paret]] for the Welterweight Championship at [[New York City|New York]]'s [[Madison Square Garden]]. Paret was carried from the ring unconscious, and died several days later as a result of his injuries that he had sustained in that bout.\n\n===''Wide World of Sports'' (1964-2000)===\nPrior to the advent of ''Wide World of Sports'', many major [[List of heavyweight boxing champions|heavyweight boxing title]] matches were televised via \u201c[[Closed-circuit television|closed-circuit]]\u201d (this generally meant that you had go to a movie theater to see it, pay a decent-sized amount of money to get it, and then watch it on a giant screen). Often, ''Wide World of Sports'' would show full-length replays of the fights a week or two later; these replays were usually called by [[Howard Cosell]], who became one of the best-known (and possibly most controversial) sportscaster in American television history.\n\n[[Jerry Quarry]] retired for over two and a half years after his 1975 fight with [[Ken Norton]] fight. At around this time, Quarry signed a contract with ABC to be a boxing commentator. Quarry was very popular in this position, drawing the ire of Howard Cosell, an ABC commentator being pushed out of some work by Quarry. In mid-1977, a return match was being put together which would put Quarry in against a ranked heavyweight. The ranked heavyweight would be Italian Lorenzo Zanon. The match was to be televised on ABC, where Quarry was contracted. But both fighters signed to have the bout televised on [[Boxing on CBS|CBS]]. When Quarry, who often negotiated his own fight contracts, signed the bout to CBS, he lost his ABC contract. \n\nIn 1976, ABC made a deal with promoter [[Don King (boxing promoter)|Don King]] and [[The Ring (magazine)|''The Ring'' magazine]] to stage a tournament<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.si.com/more-sports/2014/10/31/al-michaels-howard-cosell-you-cant-make-excerpt|title=Book excerpt: Al Michaels reflects on his time with Howard Cosell|last=Michaels, Wertheim|first=Al, L.

In 1986, after Cosell's retirement, Wallau became ABC's [[boxing]] analyst.  He was honored by the [[Boxing Writers Association of America]] as the top television boxing journalist in his first year.\n\n=====[[Howard Cosell]]=====\nCosell rose to prominence in the early 1960s, covering boxer [[Muhammad Ali]], beginning from the time he fought under his [[Name at birth|birth name]], Cassius Clay. The two seemed to have an affinity despite their different personalities, and complemented each other in broadcasts. Cosell was one of the first sportscasters to refer to the boxer as Muhammad Ali after he changed his name, and supported him when he refused to be inducted into the military. Cosell called most of Ali's fights immediately before and after the boxer returned from his three-year exile in October 1970. Those fights were broadcast on taped delay usually a week after they were transmitted on closed circuit. However, Cosell did not call two of Ali's biggest fights, the [[Rumble in the Jungle]] in October 1974 and the first [[Fight of the Century|Ali\u2013Joe Frazier bout]] in March 1971. Promoter [[Jerry Perenchio]] selected actor [[Burt Lancaster]], who had never provided color commentary for a fight, to work the bout with longtime announcer [[Don Dunphy]] and former light-heavyweight champion [[Archie Moore]]. Cosell attended that fight as a spectator only. He would do a voiceover of that bout, when it was shown on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] a few days before the second [[Muhammad Ali vs. Joe Frazier II|Ali-Frazier bout]] in January 1974.\n\nPerhaps his most famous call took place in the [[George Foreman#The Sunshine Showdown vs. Joe Frazier|fight]] between [[Joe Frazier]] and [[George Foreman]] for the World Heavyweight Championship in [[Kingston, Jamaica]] in 1973. When Foreman knocked Frazier to the mat the first of six times, roughly two minutes into the first round, Cosell yelled out:\n\n{{quote|Down Goes Frazier! Down Goes Frazier! Down Goes Frazier!}}\n\nHis call of Frazier's first trip to the mat became one of the most quoted phrases in American sports broadcasting history. Foreman beat Frazier by a TKO in the second round to win the [[World heavyweight boxing championship|World Heavyweight Championship]].\n\nCosell provided blow-by-blow commentary for ABC of some of boxing's biggest matches during the 1970s and the early 1980s, including [[Ken Norton]]'s upset win over Ali in 1973 and Ali's defeat of [[Leon Spinks]] in 1978 recapturing the Heavyweight title for the third time. His signature [[toupee]] was unceremoniously knocked off in front of live ABC cameras when a scuffle broke out after a broadcast match between [[Scott LeDoux]] and Johnny Boudreaux. Cosell quickly retrieved his hairpiece and replaced it. During interviews in studio with Ali, the champion would tease and threaten to remove the hairpiece with Cosell playing along but never allowing it to be touched. On one of these occasions, Ali quipped, \"Cosell, you're a phony, and that thing on your head comes from the tail of a pony.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5294873|title=Ali and Cosell, Irresistible Enigmas}}</ref>\n\nWith typical headline generating drama, Cosell abruptly ended his broadcast association with the sport of boxing while providing coverage for ABC for the heavyweight championship bout between [[Larry Holmes]] and [[Randall \"Tex\" Cobb]] on November 26, 1982<ref>{{cite book |last=Bloom |first=John|date= |title=There You Have it: The Life, Legacy, and Legend of Howard Cosell|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pRirlKfG3J0C&pg=PA153&dq=ABC+Sports+Boxing&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjOhp6EkozkAhULEawKHYzfBE44KBDoATACegQIBBAC#v=onepage&q=ABC%20Sports%20Boxing&f=false|location= |publisher=Univ of Massachusetts Press|page=153|isbn= |author-link=}}</ref>. Halfway through the bout and with Cobb absorbing a beating, Cosell stopped providing anything more than rudimentary comments about round number and the participants punctuated with occasional declarations of disgust during the 15 rounds. He declared shortly after the fight to a national television audience that he had broadcast his last professional boxing match.\n\nIn the [[Boxing at the 1976 Summer Olympics|1976 Summer Games in Montreal]], and the [[Boxing at the 1984 Summer Olympics|1984 games in Los Angeles]], Cosell was the main voice for boxing. [[Sugar Ray Leonard]] won the gold medal in his light welterweight class at Montreal, beginning his meteoric rise to a world professional title a few years later, and Cosell became close to Leonard, during this period, announcing many of his fights.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">\"I Never Played The Game\", by Howard Cosell, 1985</ref>\n\n===Cancelled 2007 card===\n{{see also|Boxing on ESPN}}\n\nSeven years after ABC's last boxing card, they were scheduled to broadcast a card from [[Boardwalk Hall]] in [[Atlantic City, New Jersey]] on April 22, 2007. The card would've featured former light heavyweight champion [[Antonio Tarver]] facing off against [[Elvir Muriqi]]. Promoter Joe DeGuardia of Star Boxing had been working on the [[Brokered programming|time buy]] deal (in other words, DeGuardia was not paid a licensing fee by ABC, but rather bought an hour of time from the network). The production would've been handled by ABC's sister company, [[ESPN]] with ''[[Friday Night Fights]]'' commentators [[Joe Tessitore]] and [[Teddy Atlas]].

His father Jean-Etienne Say was born to a [[Protestant]] family which had moved from [[N\u00eemes]] to [[Geneva]] for some time in consequence of the revocation of the [[Edict of Nantes]]. Say was intended to follow a commercial career and in 1785 was sent with his brother Horace to complete his education in England. He lodged for a time in [[Croydon]] and afterwards (following a return visit to France) in [[Fulham]]. During the latter period, he was employed successively by two London-based firms of sugar merchants, James Baillie & Co and Samuel and William Hibbert.<ref>{{citation|first=Brian|last=Lancaster|title=Jean-Baptiste Say's 1785 Croydon street plan|journal=Croydon Natural History & Scientific Society Bulletin|volume=144|date=March 2012|pages=2\u20135}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|first=Brian|last=Lancaster|year=2015|title=Jean-Baptiste Say's First Visit to England (1785/6)|journal=History of European Ideas|volume=41|issue=7|pages=922\u2013930|doi=10.1080/01916599.2014.989676}}</ref> At the end of 1786, he accompanied Samuel Hibbert on a voyage to France which ended in December with Hibbert's death in [[Nantes]]. Say returned to Paris, where he found employment in the office of a [[life assurance]] company directed by [[\u00c9tienne Clavi\u00e8re]]. His brother [[Louis Auguste Say|Louis Auguste]] (1774\u20131840) also became an economist.\n\n== Writings, teaching and entrepreneurship ==\n[[File:Say - Lettres a M. Malthus, 1820 - 5496950.tif|thumb|upright|Title page of Say's ''Lettres \u00e0 M. Malthus, sur diff\u00e9rens sujets d'\u00e9conomie politique'', published in 1820]]\nSay's first literary attempt was a pamphlet on the liberty of the press, published in 1789. He later worked under [[Honor\u00e9 Gabriel Riqueti, Comte de Mirabeau|Mirabeau]] on the ''Courrier de Provence''. In 1792, he took part as a volunteer in the campaign of [[Champagne (province)|Champagne]]. In 1793, he assumed in keeping with [[French Revolution]]ary fashion the pseudonym Atticus and became secretary to [[\u00c9tienne Clavi\u00e8re]], the then finance minister.\n\nFrom 1794 to 1800, he edited a periodical, entitled ''La Decade philosophique, litteraire, et politique'', in which he expounded the doctrines of [[Adam Smith]]. He had by this time established his reputation as a publicist and when the [[French Consulate|consular government]] was established in 1799 he was selected as one of the 100 members of the [[Tribunat]], resigning the editorship of the ''Decade''. In 1800, Say published ''Olbie, ou essai sur les moyens de r\u00e9former les m\u0153urs d'une nation''. In 1803, he published his principal work, the ''[[Say's Political Economy|Trait\u00e9 d'\u00e9conomie politique ou simple exposition de la mani\u00e8re dont se forment, se distribuent et se composent les richesses]]''. Having proved unwilling to compromise his convictions in the interests of [[Napoleon]], Say was removed from the office of tribune in 1804. He turned to industrial activities and after having familiarised himself with the processes of cotton manufacture he established a [[Cotton mill|spinning-mill]] at [[Auchy-l\u00e8s-Hesdin]] in the [[Pas de Calais]] which employed some 400\u2013500 people, mainly women and children. He devoted his leisure time to revising his economic treatise which had been out of print for some time, but the system of state censorship in place prevented him from republishing it.\n\nIn 1814, Say availed himself (to use his own words) of the relative liberty arising from the [[War of the Sixth Coalition|entrance of the allied powers into France]] to bring out a second edition of the work dedicated to the emperor [[Alexander I of Russia]], who had professed himself his pupil. In the same year, the French government sent him to study the economic condition of the United Kingdom. The results of his observations appeared in a tract, ''De l'Angleterre et des Anglais''. A third edition of the ''Trait\u00e9'' appeared in 1817.\n\nA chair of industrial economy was established for him in 1819 at the [[Conservatoire des Arts et M\u00e9tiers]]. Also in 1819, he was one of the founders of the ''\u00c9cole sp\u00e9ciale de commerce et d'industrie'', one of the first [[business school]]s in the world, and now (as ''\u00c9cole sup\u00e9rieure de commerce de Paris -'' [[ESCP Europe|ESCP]]) regarded as the world's oldest business school.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Kaplan|first=Andreas|year=2014|title=European management and European business schools: Insights from the history of business schools|journal=European Management Journal|volume=32|issue=4|pages=529\u2013534|doi=10.1016/j.emj.2014.03.006}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.escpeurope.eu/bicentenary|title=First into the Future|accessdate=17 August 2019}}</ref> In 1831, he was made professor of political economy at the [[Coll\u00e8ge de France]]. In 1828\u20131830, he published his ''Cours complet d'economie politique pratique''.\n\n== Say's law ==\n{{neoliberalism sidebar}}\n{{further|Say's law}}\nSay is well known for Say's law, or the law of markets, often controversially summarised as such:\n* \"[[Aggregate supply]] creates its own [[aggregate demand]]\"\n* \"[[Supply creates its own demand]]\"\n\nSay's law is instead uncontroversially summarized as such:\n* \"Supply constitutes its own demand\"\n* \"Inherent in supply is the wherewithal for its own consumption\" (direct translation from French ''Trait\u00e9 d'\u00e9conomie politique'')\n\nSay's Law emerged during the early period of the Industrial Revolution, at a time when the economic phenomena of increased output merged with England's cyclical inability to maintain both sales and unemployment. This led many to believe that there was a limit to the growth of production, and there may come a point when there is no means of purchasing all output generated. Say's Law of Markets deals with the fact that production of commodities causes income to be paid to suppliers of the components of capital, labor, and land used in producing these goods and services. The sale price of these commodities is the sum of the payments of wages, rents, and profit. <ref> {Sowell, Thomas. Say's Law: An Historical Analysis. Princeton University Press, 2015.} </ref> Income generated during production of a commodity equals the value of that commodity. Therefore, an increase in the supply of output will result in an increase in the income necessary to generate demand for those products. In the words of Jean-Baptiste Say, \"unless we produce, we cannot consume; unless we first supply, we cannot demand.\" <ref> {Eberling, Richard. Economic Ideas: Jean-Baptiste Say and the \"Law of Markets\". 19 06 2017. 01 04 2020.}</ref>\n\nThe exact phrase \"supply creates its own demand\" was coined by [[John Maynard Keynes]], who criticized it as in the former two, equating all four of these statements to mean the same thing. Some economists, including some advocates of Say's law who dispute this characterization as a misrepresentation,<ref name=\"clower92\">{{Harv|Clower|2004|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=tzzClShefiYC&pg=PA92 p. 92]}}</ref> have disputed his interpretation, claiming that Say's law can actually be summarized more accurately as \"production precedes consumption\" and that Say was claiming that in order to consume one must produce something of value so that one can trade this (either in the form of money or barter) in order to consume later.<ref>Bylund, Per. [https://twitter.com/perbylund/status/883692795583746049 \"Say's Law (the Law of Markets)\"].</ref>\n\nSimilar sentiments through different wordings appear in the work of [[John Stuart Mill]] (1848) and his father [[James Mill]] (1808). The Scottish classical economist James Mill restates Say's law in 1808, writing that \"production of commodities creates, and is the one and universal cause which creates a market for the commodities produced\".<ref>Mill, James (1808). ''Commerce Defended''. [http://oll.libertyfund.org/index.php?option=com_staticxt&staticfile=show.php%3Ftitle=1668&layout=html \"Chapter VI: Consumption\"]. p. 81.</ref>\n\nIn Say's language, \"products are paid for with products\" (1803, p. 153) or \"a glut can take place only when there are too many means of production applied to one kind of product and not enough to another\" (1803, pp. 178\u2013179). Explaining his point at length, he wrote the following:<ref>[http://cepa.newschool.edu/het/profiles/say.htm \"Information on Jean-Baptiste Say\"].{{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090326021523/http://cepa.newschool.edu/het/profiles/say.htm|date=26 March 2009}}</ref>\n{{quote|It is worthwhile to remark that a product is no sooner created than it, from that instant, affords a market for other products to the full extent of its own value. When the producer has put the finishing hand to his product, he is most anxious to sell it immediately, lest its value should diminish in his hands. Nor is he less anxious to dispose of the money he may get for it; for the value of money is also perishable. But the only way of getting rid of money is in the purchase of some product or other. Thus the mere circumstance of creation of one product immediately opens a vent for other products.<ref>Say, Jean-Baptiste (1803). ''A Treatise on Political Economy''. pp. 138\u2013139.</ref>}}\n\nSay also wrote that it is not the abundance of money, but the abundance of other products in general that facilitates sales:<ref>Say, Jean-Baptiste (1803). ''A Treatise on Political Economy''. Translated from the fourth edition of the French in 2001. Batoche Books Kitchener. p. 57.</ref>\n{{quote|Money performs but a momentary function in this double exchange; and when the transaction is finally closed, it will always be found, that one kind of commodity has been exchanged for another.}}\n\nSay's law may also have been culled from [[Ecclesiastes]] 5:11 \u2013 \"When goods increase, they are increased that eat them: and what good is there to the owners thereof, saving the beholding of them with their eyes?\" ([[King James Version|KJV]]). Say's law has been considered by [[John Kenneth Galbraith]] as \"the most distinguished example of the stability of economic ideas, including when they are wrong\".<ref>{{citation|first=John Kenneth|last=Galbraith|title=Money: Whence It Came, Where It Went|location=Boston|publisher=Houghton Mifflin|year=1975|isbn=0-395-19843-7}}.</ref>\n\n== Theory of entrepreneurship ==\nIn the ''Treatise'', his main economic work, Say stated that any production process required effort, knowledge and the \"application\" of the entrepreneur. According to him, entrepreneurs are intermediaries in the production process who combine productive agents such as land, capital and labor in order to meet the demand of consumers. As a result, they play a central role in the economy and fulfil a coordinating role.<ref name=\"Entrepreneurship\"/>\n\nBesides studying large-scale entrepreneurs, Say looked at people working for themselves:\n{{quote|When a workman carries on an enterprise on his own account, as the knife grinder in the streets, he is both workman and entrepreneur.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://mises.org/library/catechism-political-economy|title=Catechism of Political Economy|last=Say|first=Jean-Baptiste|year=1821|publisher=Mises Institute|accessdate=13 August 2019}}</ref>}}\n\nSay also thought about which qualities are essential for successful entrepreneurs and highlighted the quality of judgement. To his mind, entrepreneurs have to continuously assess market needs and the means which could meet them, which requires an \"unerring market sense\".<ref name=\"Entrepreneurship\"/>\n\nAs he emphasized the coordinating function of entrepreneurs, Say viewed entrepreneurial income primarily as high wages that are paid in compensation for the skills and expert knowledge of entrepreneurs. He did so by making a distinction between the enterprise function and the supply-of-capital-function which allowed him to look at the earnings of the entrepreneur on the one hand and the remuneration of capital on the other hand. This clearly differentiates his theory from that of [[Joseph Schumpeter]], who described entrepreneurial rent as short-term profits that compensate for high risk ([[Schumpeterian rent]]).<ref name=\"Entrepreneurship\"/> Say also touched upon [[risk]] and [[uncertainty]] as well as [[innovation]] when discussing entrepreneurship, although he never deeply investigated their relationships. However, Say stated:\n{{quote|[In any enterprise activity] there is an abundance of obstacles to be surmounted, of anxieties to be repressed, of misfortunes to be repaired, and of expedients to be devised [...] [and] there is always a degree of risk attending such undertakings.<ref>{{cite book|title=A Treatise on Political Economy|last=Say|first=Jean-Baptiste|publisher=Claxton, Remsen & Haffelfinger|year=1880|isbn=|location=Philadelphia|pages=331}}</ref>}}\n{{quote|Sometimes a manufacturer discovers a process, calculated either to introduce a new product, to increase the beauty of an old one, or to produce with greater economy.<ref>{{cite book|title=A Treatise on Political economy.|last=Say|first=Jean-Baptiste|publisher=Claxton, Remsen & Haffelfinger|year=1880|isbn=|location=Philadelphia|pages=329}}</ref>}}\n\n== Honours ==\nIn 1826, Say was elected a foreign member of the [[Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences]].\n\n== Later years and death ==\n[[File:P\u00e8re-Lachaise - Division 39 - Say 01.jpg|thumb|Say's tomb in the [[P\u00e8re Lachaise Cemetery]] in Paris]]\nIn his later years, Say became subject to attacks of nervous [[apoplexy]].

He is best known for [[Say's law]]\u2014also known as the law of markets\u2014which he popularized.

His father Jean-Etienne Say was born to a [[Protestant]] family which had moved from [[N\u00eemes]] to [[Geneva]] for some time in consequence of the revocation of the [[Edict of Nantes]]. Say was intended to follow a commercial career and in 1785 was sent with his brother Horace to complete his education in England. He lodged for a time in [[Croydon]] and afterwards (following a return visit to France) in [[Fulham]]. During the latter period, he was employed successively by two London-based firms of sugar merchants, James Baillie & Co and Samuel and William Hibbert.<ref>{{citation|first=Brian|last=Lancaster|title=Jean-Baptiste Say's 1785 Croydon street plan|journal=Croydon Natural History & Scientific Society Bulletin|volume=144|date=March 2012|pages=2\u20135}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|first=Brian|last=Lancaster|year=2015|title=Jean-Baptiste Say's First Visit to England (1785/6)|journal=History of European Ideas|volume=41|issue=7|pages=922\u2013930|doi=10.1080/01916599.2014.989676}}</ref> At the end of 1786, he accompanied Samuel Hibbert on a voyage to France which ended in December with Hibbert's death in [[Nantes]]. Say returned to Paris, where he found employment in the office of a [[life assurance]] company directed by [[\u00c9tienne Clavi\u00e8re]]. His brother [[Louis Auguste Say|Louis Auguste]] (1774\u20131840) also became an economist.\n\n== Writings, teaching and entrepreneurship ==\n[[File:Say - Lettres a M. Malthus, 1820 - 5496950.tif|thumb|upright|Title page of Say's ''Lettres \u00e0 M. Malthus, sur diff\u00e9rens sujets d'\u00e9conomie politique'', published in 1820]]\nSay's first literary attempt was a pamphlet on the liberty of the press, published in 1789. He later worked under [[Honor\u00e9 Gabriel Riqueti, Comte de Mirabeau|Mirabeau]] on the ''Courrier de Provence''. In 1792, he took part as a volunteer in the campaign of [[Champagne (province)|Champagne]]. In 1793, he assumed in keeping with [[French Revolution]]ary fashion the pseudonym Atticus and became secretary to [[\u00c9tienne Clavi\u00e8re]], the then finance minister.\n\nFrom 1794 to 1800, he edited a periodical, entitled ''La Decade philosophique, litteraire, et politique'', in which he expounded the doctrines of [[Adam Smith]]. He had by this time established his reputation as a publicist and when the [[French Consulate|consular government]] was established in 1799 he was selected as one of the 100 members of the [[Tribunat]], resigning the editorship of the ''Decade''. In 1800, Say published ''Olbie, ou essai sur les moyens de r\u00e9former les m\u0153urs d'une nation''. In 1803, he published his principal work, the ''[[Say's Political Economy|Trait\u00e9 d'\u00e9conomie politique ou simple exposition de la mani\u00e8re dont se forment, se distribuent et se composent les richesses]]''. Having proved unwilling to compromise his convictions in the interests of [[Napoleon]], Say was removed from the office of tribune in 1804. He turned to industrial activities and after having familiarised himself with the processes of cotton manufacture he established a [[Cotton mill|spinning-mill]] at [[Auchy-l\u00e8s-Hesdin]] in the [[Pas de Calais]] which employed some 400\u2013500 people, mainly women and children. He devoted his leisure time to revising his economic treatise which had been out of print for some time, but the system of state censorship in place prevented him from republishing it.\n\nIn 1814, Say availed himself (to use his own words) of the relative liberty arising from the [[War of the Sixth Coalition|entrance of the allied powers into France]] to bring out a second edition of the work dedicated to the emperor [[Alexander I of Russia]], who had professed himself his pupil. In the same year, the French government sent him to study the economic condition of the United Kingdom. The results of his observations appeared in a tract, ''De l'Angleterre et des Anglais''. A third edition of the ''Trait\u00e9'' appeared in 1817.\n\nA chair of industrial economy was established for him in 1819 at the [[Conservatoire des Arts et M\u00e9tiers]]. Also in 1819, he was one of the founders of the ''\u00c9cole sp\u00e9ciale de commerce et d'industrie'', one of the first [[business school]]s in the world, and now (as ''\u00c9cole sup\u00e9rieure de commerce de Paris -'' [[ESCP Europe|ESCP]]) regarded as the world's oldest business school.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Kaplan|first=Andreas|year=2014|title=European management and European business schools: Insights from the history of business schools|journal=European Management Journal|volume=32|issue=4|pages=529\u2013534|doi=10.1016/j.emj.2014.03.006}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.escpeurope.eu/bicentenary|title=First into the Future|accessdate=17 August 2019}}</ref> In 1831, he was made professor of political economy at the [[Coll\u00e8ge de France]]. In 1828\u20131830, he published his ''Cours complet d'economie politique pratique''.\n\n== Say's law ==\n{{neoliberalism sidebar}}\n{{further|Say's law}}\nSay is well known for Say's law, or the law of markets, often controversially summarised as such:\n* \"[[Aggregate supply]] creates its own [[aggregate demand]]\"\n* \"[[Supply creates its own demand]]\"\n\nSay's law is instead uncontroversially summarized as such:\n* \"Supply constitutes its own demand\"\n* \"Inherent in supply is the wherewithal for its own consumption\" (direct translation from French ''Trait\u00e9 d'\u00e9conomie politique'')\n\nThe exact phrase \"supply creates its own demand\" was coined by [[John Maynard Keynes]], who criticized it as in the former two, equating all four of these statements to mean the same thing. Some economists, including some advocates of Say's law who dispute this characterization as a misrepresentation,<ref name=\"clower92\">{{Harv|Clower|2004|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=tzzClShefiYC&pg=PA92 p. 92]}}</ref> have disputed his interpretation, claiming that Say's law can actually be summarized more accurately as \"production precedes consumption\" and that Say was claiming that in order to consume one must produce something of value so that one can trade this (either in the form of money or barter) in order to consume later.<ref>Bylund, Per. [https://twitter.com/perbylund/status/883692795583746049 \"Say's Law (the Law of Markets)\"].</ref>\n\nSimilar sentiments through different wordings appear in the work of [[John Stuart Mill]] (1848) and his father [[James Mill]] (1808). The Scottish classical economist James Mill restates Say's law in 1808, writing that \"production of commodities creates, and is the one and universal cause which creates a market for the commodities produced\".<ref>Mill, James (1808). ''Commerce Defended''. [http://oll.libertyfund.org/index.php?option=com_staticxt&staticfile=show.php%3Ftitle=1668&layout=html \"Chapter VI: Consumption\"]. p. 81.</ref>\n\nIn Say's language, \"products are paid for with products\" (1803, p. 153) or \"a glut can take place only when there are too many means of production applied to one kind of product and not enough to another\" (1803, pp. 178\u2013179). Explaining his point at length, he wrote the following:<ref>[http://cepa.newschool.edu/het/profiles/say.htm \"Information on Jean-Baptiste Say\"].{{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090326021523/http://cepa.newschool.edu/het/profiles/say.htm|date=26 March 2009}}</ref>\n{{quote|It is worthwhile to remark that a product is no sooner created than it, from that instant, affords a market for other products to the full extent of its own value. When the producer has put the finishing hand to his product, he is most anxious to sell it immediately, lest its value should diminish in his hands. Nor is he less anxious to dispose of the money he may get for it; for the value of money is also perishable. But the only way of getting rid of money is in the purchase of some product or other. Thus the mere circumstance of creation of one product immediately opens a vent for other products.<ref>Say, Jean-Baptiste (1803). ''A Treatise on Political Economy''. pp. 138\u2013139.</ref>}}\n\nSay also wrote that it is not the abundance of money, but the abundance of other products in general that facilitates sales:<ref>Say, Jean-Baptiste (1803).

Batoche Books Kitchener. p. 57.</ref>\n{{quote|Money performs but a momentary function in this double exchange; and when the transaction is finally closed, it will always be found, that one kind of commodity has been exchanged for another.}}\n\nSay's law may also have been culled from [[Ecclesiastes]] 5:11 \u2013 \"When goods increase, they are increased that eat them: and what good is there to the owners thereof, saving the beholding of them with their eyes?\" ([[King James Version|KJV]]). Say's law has been considered by [[John Kenneth Galbraith]] as \"the most distinguished example of the stability of economic ideas, including when they are wrong\".<ref>{{citation|first=John Kenneth|last=Galbraith|title=Money: Whence It Came, Where It Went|location=Boston|publisher=Houghton Mifflin|year=1975|isbn=0-395-19843-7}}.</ref>\n\n== Theory of entrepreneurship ==\nIn the ''Treatise'', his main economic work, Say stated that any production process required effort, knowledge and the \"application\" of the entrepreneur. According to him, entrepreneurs are intermediaries in the production process who combine productive agents such as land, capital and labor in order to meet the demand of consumers. As a result, they play a central role in the economy and fulfil a coordinating role.<ref name=\"Entrepreneurship\"/>\n\nBesides studying large-scale entrepreneurs, Say looked at people working for themselves:\n{{quote|When a workman carries on an enterprise on his own account, as the knife grinder in the streets, he is both workman and entrepreneur.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://mises.org/library/catechism-political-economy|title=Catechism of Political Economy|last=Say|first=Jean-Baptiste|year=1821|publisher=Mises Institute|accessdate=13 August 2019}}</ref>}}\n\nSay also thought about which qualities are essential for successful entrepreneurs and highlighted the quality of judgement. To his mind, entrepreneurs have to continuously assess market needs and the means which could meet them, which requires an \"unerring market sense\".<ref name=\"Entrepreneurship\"/>\n\nAs he emphasized the coordinating function of entrepreneurs, Say viewed entrepreneurial income primarily as high wages that are paid in compensation for the skills and expert knowledge of entrepreneurs. He did so by making a distinction between the enterprise function and the supply-of-capital-function which allowed him to look at the earnings of the entrepreneur on the one hand and the remuneration of capital on the other hand. This clearly differentiates his theory from that of [[Joseph Schumpeter]], who described entrepreneurial rent as short-term profits that compensate for high risk ([[Schumpeterian rent]]).<ref name=\"Entrepreneurship\"/> Say also touched upon [[risk]] and [[uncertainty]] as well as [[innovation]] when discussing entrepreneurship, although he never deeply investigated their relationships. However, Say stated:\n{{quote|[In any enterprise activity] there is an abundance of obstacles to be surmounted, of anxieties to be repressed, of misfortunes to be repaired, and of expedients to be devised [...] [and] there is always a degree of risk attending such undertakings.<ref>{{cite book|title=A Treatise on Political Economy|last=Say|first=Jean-Baptiste|publisher=Claxton, Remsen & Haffelfinger|year=1880|isbn=|location=Philadelphia|pages=331}}</ref>}}\n{{quote|Sometimes a manufacturer discovers a process, calculated either to introduce a new product, to increase the beauty of an old one, or to produce with greater economy.<ref>{{cite book|title=A Treatise on Political economy.|last=Say|first=Jean-Baptiste|publisher=Claxton, Remsen & Haffelfinger|year=1880|isbn=|location=Philadelphia|pages=329}}</ref>}}\n\n== Honours ==\nIn 1826, Say was elected a foreign member of the [[Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences]].\n\n== Later years and death ==\n[[File:P\u00e8re-Lachaise - Division 39 - Say 01.jpg|thumb|Say's tomb in the [[P\u00e8re Lachaise Cemetery]] in Paris]]\nIn his later years, Say became subject to attacks of nervous [[apoplexy]].

With the loss of their top order, England fell to 86/4 in the 24th over, however, a century partnership between Ben Stokes and Jos Buttler for the fifth wicket got them back into the game before Buttler was caught on 59. However, with five overs to play, England still required another 46 runs, and the bottom order were forced to bat more aggressively. Stokes managed to farm the strike and, more crucially, score runs, leaving England needing 15 to win from the final over, two wickets still in hand. After two [[Glossary of cricket terms#D|dot balls]], Stokes first planted a six into the stands at deep mid-wicket; on the next ball, the fielder's throw deflected off Stokes' bat as he was coming back for a second run and went to the boundary for an additional four; umpire Kumar Dharmasena awarded six runs for that delivery, despite the ''[[Laws of Cricket]]'' saying only one of the batsmen's runs should have counted towards the total as they had not crossed during the attempted second run at the moment the fielder threw the ball in.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/cricket/48991962|title=England Cricket World Cup win: 'Extra run' claims brushed off by Ashley Giles|work=BBC Sport|date=15 July 2019|access-date=4 August 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190721111216/https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/cricket/48991962|archive-date=21 July 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> The final two deliveries of the over saw England get a run each, but losing their last two wickets going for a second run each time, leaving the scores tied at 241 with Stokes left unbeaten with 84.<ref>{{cite news|first=Vic|last=Marks|url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/jul/14/england-new-zealand-cricket-world-cup-final-match-report-super-over|title=England win Cricket World Cup after super-over drama against New Zealand|newspaper=The Guardian|date=14 July 2019|access-date=17 July 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190716093839/https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/jul/14/england-new-zealand-cricket-world-cup-final-match-report-super-over|archive-date=16 July 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nWith the scores tied, the match went to a [[Super Over]]. England returned Stokes and Buttler to the crease, and they handled Trent Boult's bowling to accumulate 15 runs without loss. For New Zealand, Martin Guptill and James Neesham went in to face Jofra Archer needing at least 16 runs to claim the title. After a steady accumulation of runs, including a wide and a six, left New Zealand needing two from the final delivery, Guptill hit the ball out to deep mid-wicket and tried to scamper back for the winning run, but Roy's throw in to Buttler was a good one with Guptill being well short of his crease. New Zealand finished with 15 runs to tie the Super Over, but England's superior boundary count in the match and Super Over combined (26 to New Zealand's 17) meant they claimed the World Cup title for the first time after three previous final defeats in [[1979 Cricket World Cup|1979]], [[1987 Cricket World Cup|1987]] and 1992.<ref>{{cite web|first=Alan|last=Gardner|url=https://www.espncricinfo.com/series/8039/report/1144530/england-vs-new-zealand-final-icc-cricket-world-cup-2019|title=Epic final tied, Super Over tied, England win World Cup on boundary count|work=ESPNcricinfo|date=14 July 2019|access-date=17 July 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190715190820/https://www.espncricinfo.com/series/8039/report/1144530/england-vs-new-zealand-final-icc-cricket-world-cup-2019|archive-date=15 July 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> Ben Stokes was named man of the match; referring to the controversial overthrows that deflected off his bat, he said he would be \"apologising to [New Zealand captain Kane Williamson] for the rest of [his] life\", and later said England's first World Cup victory was \"written in the stars\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.thedailystar.net/icc-cricket-world-cup-2019/will-apologise-kane-williamson-rest-my-life-ben-stokes-1771942|title=Will apologise to Kane for rest of my life: Stokes|newspaper=The Daily Star|date=16 July 2019|access-date=17 September 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190920221429/https://www.thedailystar.net/icc-cricket-world-cup-2019/will-apologise-kane-williamson-rest-my-life-ben-stokes-1771942|archive-date=20 September 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n{{Single-innings cricket match\n| bg = #eee\n| date = {{anchor|match48}} 14 July 2019\n| team1 = {{cr-rt|NZ}}\n| team2 = {{cr|ENG}}\n| score1 = 241/8 (50 overs)\n| score2 = 241 (50 overs)\n| result = [[2019 Cricket World Cup knockout stage#Final|Match tied]]\n| report = [https://www.espncricinfo.com/series/8039/game/1144530/england-vs-new-zealand-final-icc-cricket-world-cup-2019/ Scorecard]\n| venue = [[Lord's]], London\n| notes = Super Over: England 15/0, New Zealand 15/1.\n*''England won the match on the boundary count back rule (26\u201317).''\n}}\n\n==Statistics==\n{{main|2019 Cricket World Cup statistics}}\nIndia's Rohit Sharma ended the tournament as the leading run scorer with 648 runs from nine matches which featured a 140 against Pakistan at Old Trafford.<ref name=IndiavsPakistan/> He finished ahead of Australia's David Warner (647 runs) and Bangladesh's Shakib Al Hasan (606 runs).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://stats.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/records/batting/most_runs_career.html?id=12357;type=tournament|title=Highest run scorers at the 2019 Cricket World Cup|work=ESPNcricinfo|access-date=8 February 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200208234420/http://stats.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/records/batting/most_runs_career.html?id=12357;type=tournament|archive-date=8 February 2020|url-status=live}}</ref> Australian bowler Mitchell Starc ended up as the leading wicket-taker with 27 wickets, which surpassed the record set by [[Glenn McGrath]] in [[2007 Cricket World Cup|2007]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/icc-world-cup/mitchell-starc-breaks-glenn-mcgraths-record-for-most-wickets-in-a-world-cup/articleshow/70180202.cms|title=Mitchell Starc breaks Glenn McGrath's record for most wickets in a World Cup|newspaper=The Times of India|agency=AFP|date=11 July 2019|access-date=22 July 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190722185149/https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/icc-world-cup/mitchell-starc-breaks-glenn-mcgraths-record-for-most-wickets-in-a-world-cup/articleshow/70180202.cms|archive-date=22 July 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> Second was Lockie Ferguson from New Zealand with 21 wickets, while Mustafizur Rahman (Bangladesh) and Jofra Archer (England) were tied for third place with 20 wickets.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://stats.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/records/bowling/most_wickets_career.html?id=12357;type=tournament|title=Highest wicket takers at the 2019 Cricket World Cup|work=ESPNcricinfo|access-date=8 February 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200208234533/http://stats.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/records/bowling/most_wickets_career.html?id=12357;type=tournament|archive-date=8 February 2020|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n===Most runs===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!Runs\n!class=\"unsortable\"|Player\n!{{Abbr|Inns|Innings}}\n!{{Abbr|HS|High score}}\n!{{Abbr|Ave|Average}}\n!{{Abbr|SR|Strike rate}}\n!{{Abbr|100|Hundreds scored}}\n!{{Abbr|50|Fiftys scored}}\n!{{Abbr|4s|Fours hit}}\n!{{Abbr|6s|Sixes hit}}\n|-\n!

[[cricket]] tournament contested by men's national teams and organised by the [[International Cricket Council]] (ICC). It was hosted between 30 May to 14 July across eleven venues in [[England]] and [[Wales]] with the tournament being the fifth time that England had hosted the World Cup while for Wales it was their third.\n\nThe tournament was contested by 10 teams, a decrease from 14 teams the previous edition with the format of the tournament changing to a single round-robin group with the top four teams qualifying through to the knockout stage. After six weeks of round-robin matches, which saw four games not have a [[Result (cricket)#No result|result]], [[India national cricket team|India]], [[Australia national cricket team|Australia]], [[England cricket team|England]] and [[New Zealand national cricket team|New Zealand]] finished as the top four with [[Pakistan national cricket team|Pakistan]] missing out by [[net run rate]].\n\nIn the knockout stage, England and New Zealand won their respective semi-finals to qualify for the [[2019 Cricket World Cup Final|final]], which was played at [[Lord's]] in London. The final ended in a [[Result (cricket)#Tie|tie]] after the match ended with both teams scoring 241 [[run (cricket)|runs]], followed by the first [[Super Over]] in an ODI; England won the title, their first, on the boundary countback rule after the Super Over also finished level. Overall, approximately 2.6&nbsp;billion people around the world watched the tournament, making it the most-watched cricket competition {{as of|2019|lc=y|post=.}}<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.icc-cricket.com/media-releases/1277987|title=ICC Men's Cricket World Cup 2019 shatters audience records|publisher=International Cricket Council|date=12 July 2019|access-date=17 July 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190715174152/https://www.icc-cricket.com/media-releases/1277987|archive-date=15 July 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Hosting==\nThe hosting rights were awarded in April 2006, after England and Wales withdrew their bid to host the [[2015 Cricket World Cup]], which was played in Australia and New Zealand.

[[Imad Wasim]] immediately hit 18 runs in the 46th over, and despite losing Shadab Khan to a run out in the 47th, Wasim and Wahab Riaz saw Pakistan home to a three-wicket victory with two balls to spare.<ref>{{cite news|first=Tanya|last=Aldred|url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/jun/29/pakistan-imad-wasim-afghanistan-thriller-cricket-world-cup|title=Pakistan's Imad Wasim holds nerve to see off Afghanistan in thriller|newspaper=The Guardian|date=30 June 2019|access-date=5 July 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190702140948/https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/jun/29/pakistan-imad-wasim-afghanistan-thriller-cricket-world-cup|archive-date=2 July 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nThe return of opener Jason Roy from injury helped England escape their slump as they emerged victorious by 31 runs against the hitherto unbeaten India in a crucial must-win game for the hosts. An opening partnership between Roy (66) and [[Jonny Bairstow]] (111) was the key factor in the victory, while Stokes scored 79 runs off 54 balls for his third consecutive half-century, to help England reach 337/7. The score proved too much for India, despite [[Rohit Sharma]] and [[Virat Kohli]] scoring 102 and 66 respectively, while the returning England bowler [[Liam Plunkett]] took 3/55.<ref>{{cite web|first=Deivarayan|last=Muthu|url=https://www.espncricinfo.com/series/8039/report/1144520/england-vs-india-38th-match-icc-cricket-world-cup-2019|title=Jonny Bairstow and Ben Stokes help end India's unbeaten run|work=ESPNcricinfo|date=30 June 2019|access-date=7 July 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190701220741/https://www.espncricinfo.com/series/8039/report/1144520/england-vs-india-38th-match-icc-cricket-world-cup-2019|archive-date=1 July 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> Sri Lanka won the dead rubber against the West Indies at [[Chester-le-Street]], where both [[Avishka Fernando]] and [[Nicholas Pooran]] scored their maiden ODI centuries.<ref>{{cite news|first=Tanya|last=Aldred|url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/jul/01/sri-lanka-west-indies-cricket-world-cup-match-report|title=Avishka Fernando hits high notes and Sri Lanka hold nerve against West Indies|newspaper=The Guardian|date=2 July 2019|access-date=7 July 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190704210528/https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/jul/01/sri-lanka-west-indies-cricket-world-cup-match-report|archive-date=4 July 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> Bangladesh's Shakib Al Hasan made history against India, as he became the first man to score 500 runs and take 10 wickets in a single World Cup.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://sportstar.thehindu.com/cricket/icc-cricket-world-cup/news/shakib-al-hasan-world-cup-2019-records-batting-bowling-allrounder-new-zealand-scott-styris/article28263851.ece|title=Shakib Al Hasan first to 500 runs and 10 wickets in single World Cup|work=[[Sportstar]]|date=2 July 2019|access-date=2 July 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190702174447/https://sportstar.thehindu.com/cricket/icc-cricket-world-cup/news/shakib-al-hasan-world-cup-2019-records-batting-bowling-allrounder-new-zealand-scott-styris/article28263851.ece|archive-date=2 July 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> This performance was not enough, though, with a Rohit Sharma century leading India into the semi-finals at their opponents' expense.<ref name=IndiaQ>{{cite news|first=Tim|last=Wigmore|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/cricket/2019/07/02/bangladesh-vs-india-cricket-world-cup-2019-live-score-latest/|title=India qualify for Cricket World Cup semi-finals after Rohit Sharma's ton against Bangladesh|newspaper=The Telegraph|date=2 July 2019|access-date=7 July 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190707040434/https://www.telegraph.co.uk/cricket/2019/07/02/bangladesh-vs-india-cricket-world-cup-2019-live-score-latest/|archive-date=7 July 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n====Week 6====\n[[File:Shakib_fielding,_23_January,_2009,_Dhaka_SBNS.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Shakib Al Hasan]] (pictured in 2009) became the only cricketer in the World Cup history with 600 runs and 10 wickets.<ref name=\"Hasan\">{{cite news|first=Saurabh|last=Kumar|title=Shakib Al Hasan breaks Sachin Tendulkar' World Cup record|url=https://www.indiatoday.in/sports/cricket-world-cup-2019/story/shakib-al-hasan-breaks-sachin-tendulkar-world-cup-record-1563193-2019-07-05|work=India Today|date=5 July 2019|access-date=6 July 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190706023527/https://www.indiatoday.in/sports/cricket-world-cup-2019/story/shakib-al-hasan-breaks-sachin-tendulkar-world-cup-record-1563193-2019-07-05|archive-date=6 July 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>|alt=Shakib Al Hasan in 2009]]\nThe final round started with England taking on New Zealand, with the winner guaranteed a semi-final position.

However, with five overs to play, England still required another 46 runs, and the bottom order were forced to bat more aggressively. Stokes managed to farm the strike and, more crucially, score runs, leaving England needing 15 to win from the final over, two wickets still in hand. After two [[Glossary of cricket terms#D|dot balls]], Stokes first planted a six into the stands at deep mid-wicket; on the next ball, the fielder's throw deflected off Stokes' bat as he was coming back for a second run and went to the boundary for an additional four; umpire Kumar Dharmasena awarded six runs for that delivery, despite the ''[[Laws of Cricket]]'' saying only one of the batsmen's runs should have counted towards the total as they had not crossed during the attempted second run at the moment the fielder threw the ball in.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/cricket/48991962|title=England Cricket World Cup win: 'Extra run' claims brushed off by Ashley Giles|work=BBC Sport|date=15 July 2019|access-date=4 August 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190721111216/https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/cricket/48991962|archive-date=21 July 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> The final two deliveries of the over saw England get a run each, but losing their last two wickets going for a second run each time, leaving the scores tied at 241 with Stokes left unbeaten with 84.<ref>{{cite news|first=Vic|last=Marks|url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/jul/14/england-new-zealand-cricket-world-cup-final-match-report-super-over|title=England win Cricket World Cup after super-over drama against New Zealand|newspaper=The Guardian|date=14 July 2019|access-date=17 July 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190716093839/https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/jul/14/england-new-zealand-cricket-world-cup-final-match-report-super-over|archive-date=16 July 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nWith the scores tied, the match went to a [[Super Over]].

For New Zealand, Martin Guptill and James Neesham went in to face Jofra Archer needing at least 16 runs to claim the title. After a steady accumulation of runs, including a wide and a six, left New Zealand needing two from the final delivery, Guptill hit the ball out to deep mid-wicket and tried to scamper back for the winning run, but Roy's throw in to Buttler was a good one with Guptill being well short of his crease. New Zealand finished with 15 runs to tie the Super Over, but England's superior boundary count in the match and Super Over combined (26 to New Zealand's 17) meant they claimed the World Cup title for the first time after three previous final defeats in [[1979 Cricket World Cup|1979]], [[1987 Cricket World Cup|1987]] and 1992.<ref>{{cite web|first=Alan|last=Gardner|url=https://www.espncricinfo.com/series/8039/report/1144530/england-vs-new-zealand-final-icc-cricket-world-cup-2019|title=Epic final tied, Super Over tied, England win World Cup on boundary count|work=ESPNcricinfo|date=14 July 2019|access-date=17 July 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190715190820/https://www.espncricinfo.com/series/8039/report/1144530/england-vs-new-zealand-final-icc-cricket-world-cup-2019|archive-date=15 July 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> Ben Stokes was named man of the match; referring to the controversial overthrows that deflected off his bat, he said he would be \"apologising to [New Zealand captain Kane Williamson] for the rest of [his] life\", and later said England's first World Cup victory was \"written in the stars\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.thedailystar.net/icc-cricket-world-cup-2019/will-apologise-kane-williamson-rest-my-life-ben-stokes-1771942|title=Will apologise to Kane for rest of my life: Stokes|newspaper=The Daily Star|date=16 July 2019|access-date=17 September 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190920221429/https://www.thedailystar.net/icc-cricket-world-cup-2019/will-apologise-kane-williamson-rest-my-life-ben-stokes-1771942|archive-date=20 September 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n{{Single-innings cricket match\n| bg = #eee\n| date = {{anchor|match48}} 14 July 2019\n| team1 = {{cr-rt|NZ}}\n| team2 = {{cr|ENG}}\n| score1 = 241/8 (50 overs)\n| score2 = 241 (50 overs)\n| result = [[2019 Cricket World Cup knockout stage#Final|Match tied]]\n| report = [https://www.espncricinfo.com/series/8039/game/1144530/england-vs-new-zealand-final-icc-cricket-world-cup-2019/ Scorecard]\n| venue = [[Lord's]], London\n| notes = Super Over: England 15/0, New Zealand 15/1.\n*''England won the match on the boundary count back rule (26\u201317).''\n}}\n\n==Statistics==\n{{main|2019 Cricket World Cup statistics}}\nIndia's Rohit Sharma ended the tournament as the leading run scorer with 648 runs from nine matches which featured a 140 against Pakistan at Old Trafford.<ref name=IndiavsPakistan/> He finished ahead of Australia's David Warner (647 runs) and Bangladesh's Shakib Al Hasan (606 runs).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://stats.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/records/batting/most_runs_career.html?id=12357;type=tournament|title=Highest run scorers at the 2019 Cricket World Cup|work=ESPNcricinfo|access-date=8 February 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200208234420/http://stats.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/records/batting/most_runs_career.html?id=12357;type=tournament|archive-date=8 February 2020|url-status=live}}</ref> Australian bowler Mitchell Starc ended up as the leading wicket-taker with 27 wickets, which surpassed the record set by [[Glenn McGrath]] in [[2007 Cricket World Cup|2007]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/icc-world-cup/mitchell-starc-breaks-glenn-mcgraths-record-for-most-wickets-in-a-world-cup/articleshow/70180202.cms|title=Mitchell Starc breaks Glenn McGrath's record for most wickets in a World Cup|newspaper=The Times of India|agency=AFP|date=11 July 2019|access-date=22 July 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190722185149/https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/icc-world-cup/mitchell-starc-breaks-glenn-mcgraths-record-for-most-wickets-in-a-world-cup/articleshow/70180202.cms|archive-date=22 July 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> Second was Lockie Ferguson from New Zealand with 21 wickets, while Mustafizur Rahman (Bangladesh) and Jofra Archer (England) were tied for third place with 20 wickets.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://stats.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/records/bowling/most_wickets_career.html?id=12357;type=tournament|title=Highest wicket takers at the 2019 Cricket World Cup|work=ESPNcricinfo|access-date=8 February 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200208234533/http://stats.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/records/bowling/most_wickets_career.html?id=12357;type=tournament|archive-date=8 February 2020|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n===Most runs===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!Runs\n!class=\"unsortable\"|Player\n!{{Abbr|Inns|Innings}}\n!{{Abbr|HS|High score}}\n!{{Abbr|Ave|Average}}\n!{{Abbr|SR|Strike rate}}\n!{{Abbr|100|Hundreds scored}}\n!{{Abbr|50|Fiftys scored}}\n!{{Abbr|4s|Fours hit}}\n!{{Abbr|6s|Sixes hit}}\n|-\n!
