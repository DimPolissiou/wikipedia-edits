{"title_page": "Johannes Rath (missionary)", "text_new": "{{Use mdy dates|date=May 2019}}\n{{no footnotes|date=April 2019}}\n\n'''Johannes Rath''' ([[Vienna]], [[Austria]], January 31, 1816 \u2013 [[Kuils River]], [[Cape Colony]], June 6, 1903) was a missionary with the [[Rhenish Missionary Society]].\n\n== Missionary in Otjikango ==\nRath was trained as a weaver but heard his call to mission in 1840 and was ordained a missionary on August 14, 1844. He arrived on January 4, 1845, in [[Walvis Bay]] and arrived in Otjikango ([[Gross Barmen]]) on April 9 of the same year to work as an assistant to his fellow Rhenish Missionary [[Carl Hugo Hahn]]. He learned the [[Herero language]] so fast that he could preach in it by 1847. At the end of 1845, a major drought led to famine and the community was cut off from Walvis Bay, and Rath was assigned to go there by way of [[Windhoek]] to procure the necessary supplies. He set out on January 28, 1846, three days before his 30th birthday, but found no passage to Walvis Bay available from Windhoek and had to travel on to [[Cape Town]].\n\nDifficulties ''en route'' to Cape Town led him to return to Otjikango on December 19, 1846. In 1848, he traveled to Cape Town once more. On March 21 of that year, he married Anna J\u00f6rris van Mettmann of [[D\u00fcsseldorf]] (Germany) in Walvis Bay. The couple had six children until a shipwreck killed Mrs. Rath and her four youngest children in Walvis Bay in 1859. The remaining children, Emma Cathrina and Anna Margaretha, were nine and ten years old respectively. Hermann was six, Johannes four, Mariechen two, and Leopold a newborn.\n\n== Founder of Otjimbingwe ==\nBy the decision of a missionary conference in Otjikango in April 1849, Rath was assigned to found a missionary between there and the coast. On July 9, 1849, he founded the [[Otjimbingwe]] mission on the banks of the Swakop River, at a location the Rev. [[Heinrich Scheppmann (explorer)|Heinrich Scheppmann]] had already noted as ideal for such a waystation in 1845.\n\nThe nomadic Herero chief Zeraura agreed to settle there, leading the first of his people there with the rains in January 1850. The Rev. Rath built a simple brick house for himself and his daughters and a rudimentary building with holes for doors and windows to serve as the local church and school. Fifty pupils attended the first class. At the end of 1852, the Herero's perennial enemies, the Nama people, attacked Otjimbingwe, and after their repulsion Rath journeyed to Cape Town once more in January 1853.\n\nHe returned to his fields with [[Johanna Gertze]] (the first baptized Herero) and returned at the end of 1853 after seven months working in [[Bethanie, Namibia|Bethanie]]. Along with Hahn, the big game hunter Frederick J. Green, and J.W. Bonfield, the Rev. Rath left once more on May 20, 1857 on a four-month journey to [[Ovamboland]], mainly with an eye toward continuing the mission. They reached as far as [[Ondonga]] before local hostility forced them to flee for their lives.\n\nRath and Hahn returned to Otjimbingwe on September 11, 1857. Hahn wrote of the perilous journey in the RMS journal ''Berichte der Rhenischen Missionsgesellschaft'' (1858), in ''Petermanns Geographische Mitteilungen'' (nos. 11\u201317), and in a joint report of Rath, Hahn, and Green published under the title \"Account of an expedition from Damara Land to the Ovampo in search of the river Cunene\" (''Proceedings of the Royal Geographical Society'', vol. II, 1857\u20131858).\n\n== Shipwreck in Walvis Bay ==\nIn October 1858, Anna, her five siblings, and others traveled by ship from Walvis Bay to Cape Town, where the two oldest (Anna and Emma) were to attend school and Rath was going to work on printing his 3,900-word Herero language dictionary. On the family's return on April 1, 1859, Johannes lost his wife and four of his children in their shipwreck. Adinda Vermaak's 2004 book Kroniek van \u2019n kontrei, die verhaal van die NG kerk Kuilsrivier (\"Chronicle of a Parish: The story of the Dutch Reformed Church (NGK) Kuilsrivier\") recounts the tragedy as follows:\n\n<blockquote>In 1859, the Rev. Rath, his wife, his [four remaining] children, and his Damaraland servant, Katuti, were travelling to [[Stellenbosch]] where their two eldest daughters, Emma Cathrina (10) and Anna (8), were boarding at the Rhenish Institute (now the Rhenish Girls' High School). Rath described the family tragedy in a gripping letter to his daughters.\n\nOn March 25, 1859, the Rath family boarded the freighter Flora in Cape Town, en route to the mission in Damaraland. They were near Walvis Bay already at suppertime on April 1, when the Rev. Rath heard someone call out for the captain. Soon afterwards, they could feel the ship run aground. Rath immediately called out for his wife and fetched his four children from their beds. When they reached the deck, the waves had already breached part of the bulwark. He asked several of the crew to help his family climb higher up the rigging. None volunteered; it was everyone for themselves.\n\nThe only place the Rath family and servant could stand was on the stairs. At the top stood the Rev. Rath with the two-year-old Mariechen and the four-year-old Johannes in his arms. Further down, where he could hear but not see them were his wife Anna, the baby Leopold, Katuti, and the six-year-old Hermann, who tried bravely not to cry. The icy waves continually crashed over them. When he realized Mariechen had died in his arms, he thought it better not to tell Anna. The two prayed aloud and read Bible verses to each other, as they prepared to die. After about an hour in the icy water, Anna exclaimed \"Father, Leopold is dead.\" They then decided to await death quietly.\n\nA while later, Katuti said 'Hermann, na koka' ('Hermann is dead'). He heard nothing further from Anna. Later, he heard from Katuti that\u2014shortly after Leopold died\u2014the rope Anna was holding slipped out of her hands, when she sunk into the icy waters. The Rev. Rath then let the lifeless bodies of Mariechen and Johannes slip from his arms into the waves. After a while, stunned by the crashing waves, he focused on saving his own life and encouraged the still-living Katuti to climb higher. Besides the five Rath family members, three crew members had also perished.\n\nAfter he and Katuti were saved and eventually reached Walvis Bay, the Rev. Rath desperately searched the coast for the bodies of his wife and four children. All that washed ashore, however, was his wife's suitcase. The lock was broken and all the contents stolen, except for his Damara book. Also in the suitcase was a page from a sermon he had delivered on May 16 of the previous year: 'Thy will be done, on earth as it is in heaven.' (Matthew 6:10) At the end of the sermon, he could make out the next words, 'The Lord giveth and the Lord taketh away. Praised be the Lord.' (Job 1:21)\n\nIn the last part of his moving letter, he encouraged his two daughters in Stellenbosch to take courage. He compared their mother's suffering to Christ's on the cross. To comfort them, he relayed her telling him a short while before her death that she \"was not wholly uneasy,\" and reminded them that even Jesus, for his part, felt compelled to cry out 'My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?' (Matthew 27:45).</blockquote>\n\n== Moving to the Cape ==\nBecause his health had been affected by the shipwreck and he wanted to live closer to his two surviving children, he requested a transfer to the Rhenish mission at Sarepta near Kuils River. He returned to Otjimbingwe, but on June 13, 1861, he left the mission and South West Africa for good.\n\nIn 1862, he began his long tenure as a missionary in Sarepta, where he worked until he was replaced on July 27, 1893, by the Rev. Friedrich Eich. Many of the local white farmers and their families attended his services, and he presided over many of their funerals. Vermaak writes:\n\n<blockquote>'The Rev. Rath closed his letter to his two motherless daughters by urging them to follow the examples of their mother and Savior as diligent students that they may serve God and their fellow man...They must learn, he closed, so they could be of service. His two daughters apparently took their admonition to heart.' Anna taught school from 1882 to 1898 in Sarepta. Her sister, Emma, married a farmer from Kuils River, Dani\u00ebl Francois (grandfather Danie) de Villiers and settled on his farm, Annandale. She was a lifelong citizen of Sarepta, including as a schoolteacher. It was largely thanks to her that the residents of Kuils River, even before they had their own congregation, were conscious of the mission. The De Villiers' daughters both married missionaries: Anna Emma to Otto Sieb\u00f6rger,a Moravian missionary; and Frederica (Frieda) to H.J. Groenewald. Before her marriage, Frieda founded the Missionary Worker Society of Sarepta, conducted the church choir, played the harmonium during worship, and taught Sunday school.</blockquote>\n\nIn July 1882, Anna Rath took over the school in Sarepta with the young Maria Thomas as her assistant. The schoolhouse with its clay floor was already dilapidated. In October 1890, Rath informed the superintendent-general of education, Dr. Langham Dale, that the Cape government had not earmarked any funds for building schools, and her father accordingly took the lead, spearheading the demolition of the school to rebuild a new one that December. Local farmers and other community members each donated 500 or more bricks so the school, consisting of two classrooms, could open Easter Monday, March 30, 1891.\n\nAfter retiring, Rath initially lived in Stellenbosch, but after the marriage in November 1898 of his daughter Anna (Otjimbingwe, March 29, 1851 \u2013 Wellington, January 26, 1940) to the Rev. [[Jacobus Pauw]], he left for [[Wellington, Western Cape]] to live with his son-in-law. On a visit to his other daughter, Mrs. D.F. de Villiers of Kuils River, he died, and he was buried in Sarepta.\n\n== Writings ==\nRath and Hahn co-wrote the first hymns, scriptures, and Bible stories published in Herero (''Omahungi oa embo ra lehova na Omaimpuriro mo Otjiherero'', Cape Town, Saul Solomon & Kie, 1849). In the 1850s, just like Hahn, he apparently worked intensively toward publishing other works, especially a German-Herero dictionary. This yielded a primer (''Omahongise nokulesa Motyi-herero'', [[G\u00fctersloh]], 1862), but his other works survive only in manuscript. The Grey collection at the [[National Library of South Africa]] in Cape Town features, among others, a short English-Herero glossary (from roughly 1865); an 1865 manuscript, ''Materialien zu einem Otjiherero-Deutschen W\u00f6terbuche'', in 17 notebooks, and an 1873 manuscript written in five notebooks: ''Otjiherero W\u00f6rtersammlung als Deutsches alphabethisches Register zu dem Otjiherero-Deutschen W\u00f6rterbuche von [J. Rath]''.\n\n== Sources ==\n* (af) Kr\u00fcger, prof. D.W. and Beyers, C.J. (ed.) ''[[Suid-Afrikaanse Biografiese Woordeboek]]'' vol. III.

The two prayed aloud and read Bible verses to each other, as they prepared to die. After about an hour in the icy water, Anna exclaimed \"Father, Leopold is dead.\" They then decided to await death quietly.\n\nA while later, Katuti said 'Hermann, na koka' ('Hermann is dead'). He heard nothing further from Anna. Later, he heard from Katuti that\u2014shortly after Leopold died\u2014the rope Anna was holding slipped out of her hands, when she sunk into the icy waters. The Rev. Rath then let the lifeless bodies of Mariechen and Johannes slip from his arms into the waves. After a while, stunned by the crashing waves, he focused on saving his own life and encouraged the still-living Katuti to climb higher. Besides the five Rath family members, three crew members had also perished.\n\nAfter he and Katuti were saved and eventually reached Walvis Bay, the Rev. Rath desperately searched the coast for the bodies of his wife and four children. All that washed ashore, however, was his wife's suitcase. The lock was broken and all the contents stolen, except for his Damara book. Also in the suitcase was a page from a sermon he had delivered on May 16 of the previous year: 'Thy will be done, on earth as it is in heaven.' (Matthew 6:10) At the end of the sermon, he could make out the next words, 'The Lord giveth and the Lord taketh away. Praised be the Lord.' (Job 1:21)\n\nIn the last part of his moving letter, he encouraged his two daughters in Stellenbosch to take courage. He compared their mother's suffering to Christ's on the cross. To comfort them, he relayed her telling him a short while before her death that she \"was not wholly uneasy,\" and reminded them that even Jesus, for his part, felt compelled to cry out 'My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?' (Matthew 27:45).</blockquote>\n== Moving to the Cape ==\nBecause his health had been affected by the shipwreck and he wanted to live closer to his two surviving children, he requested a transfer to the Rhenish mission at Sarepta near Kuils River. He returned to Otjimbingwe, but on June 13, 1861, he left the mission and South West Africa for good.\n\nIn 1862, he began his long tenure as a missionary in Sarepta, where he worked until he was replaced on July 27, 1893, by the Rev. Friedrich Eich. Many of the local white farmers and their families attended his services, and he presided over many of their funerals. Vermaak writes:\n\n<blockquote>'The Rev. Rath closed his letter to his two motherless daughters by urging them to follow the examples of their mother and Savior as diligent students that they may serve God and their fellow man...They must learn, he closed, so they could be of service. His two daughters apparently took their admonition to heart.' Anna taught school from 1882 to 1898 in Sarepta. Her sister, Emma, married a farmer from Kuils River, Dani\u00ebl Francois (grandfather Danie) de Villiers and settled on his farm, Annandale. She was a lifelong citizen of Sarepta, including as a schoolteacher. It was largely thanks to her that the residents of Kuils River, even before they had their own congregation, were conscious of the mission. The De Villiers' daughters both married missionaries: Anna Emma to Otto Sieb\u00f6rger,a Moravian missionary; and Frederica (Frieda) to H.J. Groenewald. Before her marriage, Frieda founded the Missionary Worker Society of Sarepta, conducted the church choir, played the harmonium during worship, and taught Sunday school.</blockquote>\n\nIn July 1882, Anna Rath took over the school in Sarepta with the young Maria Thomas as her assistant. The schoolhouse with its clay floor was already dilapidated. In October 1890, Rath informed the superintendent-general of education, Dr. Langham Dale, that the Cape government had not earmarked any funds for building schools, and her father accordingly took the lead, spearheading the demolition of the school to rebuild a new one that December. Local farmers and other community members each donated 500 or more bricks so the school, consisting of two classrooms, could open Easter Monday, March 30, 1891.\n\nAfter retiring, Rath initially lived in Stellenbosch, but after the marriage in November 1898 of his daughter Anna (Otjimbingwe, March 29, 1851 \u2013 Wellington, January 26, 1940) to the Rev. [[Jacobus Pauw]], he left for [[Wellington, Western Cape]] to live with his son-in-law. On a visit to his other daughter, Mrs. D.F. de Villiers of Kuils River, he died, and he was buried in Sarepta.\n== Writings ==\nRath and Hahn co-wrote the first hymns, scriptures, and Bible stories published in Herero ((''Omahungi oa embo ra lehova na Omaimpuriro mo Otjiherero'', Cape Town, Saul Solomon & Kie, 1849). In the 1850s, just like Hahn, he apparently worked intensively toward publishing other works, especially a German-Herero dictionary. This yielded a primer (''Omahongise nokulesa Motyi-herero'', [[G\u00fctersloh]], 1862), but his other works survive only in manuscript. The Grey collection at the [[National Library of South Africa]] in Cape Town features, among others, a short English-Herero glossary (from roughly 1865); an 1865 manuscript, ''Materialien zu einem Otjiherero-Deutschen W\u00f6terbuche'', in 17 notebooks, and an 1873 manuscript written in five notebooks: ''Otjiherero W\u00f6rtersammlung als Deutsches alphabethisches Register zu dem Otjiherero-Deutschen W\u00f6rterbuche von [J.

He had a younger brother Jaakko and two half brothers, Feodor and Ilja. He married Katri Timola and had two sons with her, Sergei, who died in infancy, and Aleksi.

At the turn of the century, the [[Karelian Evangelical Society|Sortavala Evangelical Society]] had initiated a fanatical campaign to convert Orthodox Christians to the Lutheran faith, and as a countermeasure, the [[Karelian Brotherhood]] was founded in [[Olonets]] in 1907, at the initiative of Hieromonk, future Vicar Bishop [[Kiprian (Shnitnikov)]]. The brotherhood quickly established dozens of [[Russian language]] schools in Karelia and published study materials for these schools. The schools became quite popular, partly due to social benefits offered to the student.<ref>{{cite book |title= Kirkon historia.

A. Seyn]] in 1909\u201317, the Karelian Brotherhood was harnessed for the purposes of [[Russification]] of Karelia.<ref name=keinonen>Keinonen, Mikko: ''Oikeauskoisen nousu ja tuho''. Karlik Films, 2008. Viitattu 9.9.2016.</ref>\n\nKarhap\u00e4\u00e4 also got worried about the growing Lutheran mission work in his home area, and in 1906, he approached [[Patriarch Sergius of Moscow|Archbishop (''later'' patriarch of Moscow) Sergius]] of Finland in a letter. He asked for help in defending Orthodoxy and expressed a wish to have a school in Sonkajanranta.<ref name=keinonen/> As a result of Karhap\u00e4\u00e4's activity, an association called Orthodox Association was founded in Sonkajanranta, as a subdivision of the Saints Sergei and Herman Brotherhood. The archbishop gave his blessing to the association to found an Orthodox church school together with the Karelian Brotherhood. A school was built in Sonkajanranta the following year, with the [[Finnish language]] as the medium of instruction. By 1911, the school operated four classes. Poor students as well as those coming from farther away had a possibility to live and dine at the school, and the school was also used to house teaching, enlightenment and festive occasions for the adult population.<ref name =ort.fi />\n\nWorking for the Saints Sergei and Herman Brotherhood, Karhap\u00e4\u00e4 also engaged himself as a [[catechist]] in Ilomantsi, going around with Hieromonk Isaaki of the [[Valamo Monastery]], selling prints and literature and conducting popular Christian events, and in 1914 the [[Viipuri Spiritual Consistory]] appointed the self-taught Karhap\u00e4\u00e4 to be a religion teacher for the entire [[Kuopio Province]], with his salary being paid for by the Grand Duchy of Finland.<ref name =ort.fi /> Karhap\u00e4\u00e4's activity was the greatest from the beginning of [[World War I]]. However, at the same time he accumulated more and more enemies, and he was labelled as henchman of the tsarist regime and even a spy employed by the [[Okhrana]].<ref name=keinonen/>\n\nThe situation of the Sonkajanranta school became more difficult when Vicar Bishop Kiprian died in 1914 and the Karelian Brotherhood was paralyzed. However, the following year the [[St. Petersburg]] merchant Nesteror donated 10&nbsp;000 [[roubles]] to the school and to the building of a church next to it. The church was completed in the autumn of 1915 and consecrated to the memory of [[Anna the Prophetess]]. The blueprint for the church was drawn by monk Gennadi from the Valamo Monastery.<ref name =ort.fi /> The church was not under the jurisdiction of the [[Ilomantsi Orthodox Parish]] but under that of the Karelian Brotherhood.<ref name=keinonen/>\n\nKarhap\u00e4\u00e4's input in the school and church projects was significant, and because of his exemplary activities in church and enlightenment work, he received a number of distinctions. However, new malicious rumours were circulated about him, and his activities aroused much hatred among the local [[Fennoman movement|Fennomen]], as he was considered to be a propagator of the \u2033Russian faith\u2033 (Finnish:\u2033Ryss\u00e4n usko\u2033, the word ''[[ryss\u00e4]]'' being [[racist slur]] for Russian).<ref name=keinonen/> He was especially hated for having in 1912 received Governor-general Seyn at his home. During the visit Seyn had advised Karhap\u00e4\u00e4 to apply for funds from the government so that a proper road could be constructed to the school. After the [[Russian Revolution]] in 1917, accusations against Karhap\u00e4\u00e4 intensified, and he was called a henchman of the tsarist regime and a snoop and a [[Bolshevist]]. It was even said that he had an influence on who would be appointed priests in his home region.<ref name =ort.fi /> It was also known that Karhap\u00e4\u00e4 was a supporter of the [[Emperor of All Russia|Tsar]].<ref name=keinonen/>\n\n===In trouble in the 1910s===\nKarhap\u00e4\u00e4 had been slandered and calumniated in may ways since 1910. At that time the [[Kemi]] newspaper ''[[Per\u00e4-Pohjolainen]]'' claimed that Karhap\u00e4\u00e4 and his father were in favour of the Russian anti-Finnish policies and called them \u201cmiserable Finns\u201d.<ref name =ort.fi />\n\nAfter the Russian Revolution, the slandering became more intense. In the Fennoman papers of [[North Karelia]], e.g. in ''[[Karjalan Sanomat]]'', he was called \u201cone of the dark powers of North Karelia\u201d,<ref name=keinonen/> and his mission travels and his decorations were made fun of. It was claimed that he sowed hatred and discord among the Karelian population, which according to the claims was not properly aware of its true faith and ethnicity. In addition to this, he was called a strong and ruthless advocate of Russification, who supposedly wanted to lead all Finns into subjugation to Russia. It was also claimed that he considered himself to be a [[martyr]] and that he caused fear in the local population and that he ridiculed the Christian faith and other sacred things and that he deceived simple persons. Similar accusations were levelled at his father and brother. However, Karhap\u00e4\u00e4 himself did not answer these accusations and slandering.<ref name =ort.fi /> According to professor of Church history [[Kauko Pirinen]], this criticism was untoward, since Karhap\u00e4\u00e4's only motivation was his deep religious conviction.<ref name=keinonen />\n\nFinally he began to be opposed among the Orthodox faithful as well. Just before [[Easter]] 1917, a meeting of the people of the Ilomantsi Orthodox Parish condemned Karhap\u00e4\u00e4 and the Sonkajanranta school as non-national oppression, which was mixed with religion. It was demanded that Karhap\u00e4\u00e4 be dismissed from his positions of positions of trust and from the parish council. In the autumn of 1917, he also lost the support of Archbishop Serafim, and he was dismissed from his position as a teacher.<ref name =ort.fi /> The schools of the Karelian Brotherhood in [[Karelia (historical province of Finland)|Ladoga Karelia]] were turned over to the local municipalities, in Sonkajanranta in the autumn of 1917, a fierce nationalist [[J\u00e4ger Movement|J\u00e4ger]] from near by Kovero became its teacher. When Karhap\u00e4\u00e4 soon after this lost the support of Archbishop Serafim, he became practically an outlaw in the turmoil of the [[Finnish Civil War]].<ref name=keinonen />\n\n===Imprisonment and death===\nIn March 1918, Karhap\u00e4\u00e4 and his brother Jaakko were ordered to the [[Posse comitatus|call-up]] of the [[White Guard (Finland)|White Guards]] to the Tuupovaara Primary School. There they were arrested on the basis of a tip-off. An incriminating piece of evidence was a small icon, found in the pocket of Karhap\u00e4\u00e4's coat, intended for use school instruction. Karhap\u00e4\u00e4 was allowed to visit his home and bid farewell to his family, but then he was taken to Joensuu, at gunpoint. During a stop at a nearby house, Karhap\u00e4\u00e4 told the lady of the house that his days were numbered. In Joensuu Karhap\u00e4\u00e4 and his brother were locked up in the basement of the [[Joensuu Town Hall]] together with other prisoners.<ref name =ort.fi />\n\nIn early March 1918, Karhap\u00e4\u00e4 was taken to the Siilainen neighbourhood of Joensuu, where he was executed. At the time, executions were carried out randomly and without a trial, the executioners often being drunk. The local military districts were unable to curb the White Guards\u2019 urge to carry out executions. Karhap\u00e4\u00e4 and the others to be executed were ordered in a row, and five executioners fired a [[Volley fire|volley]]. It is said that Karhap\u00e4\u00e4 did not die instantly, and another volley was needed to finish him off. In his tombstone, the date of death is given as August 8.<ref name =ort.fi />\n\nIn the database [[War Victims of Finland 1914\u20131922]], the date of Karhap\u00e4\u00e4's death is recorded as March 7.<ref name=narc /> However, according to other data, he would have been executed some three weeks later, around Easter, and according to yet other data, only on 14 April together with 99 Russians taken prisoners during the [[Battle of Rautu (1918)|Battle of Rautu]].<ref name=loima>{{cite book |title= Ven\u00e4l\u00e4issurmat Suomessa vuosina 1914\u201322 |trans-title = \u2018Russians killed in Finland during 1914\u201322\u2019 |id = |last= Loima |first= Jyrki |authorlink= |year= 2004 |publisher= Prime Minister's Office (Finland) |location= Helsinki |isbn= 952-53544-5-8\n |page= Pa |pages= |chapter= Part 2.2.

The body was identified from the stripes of the woollen socks. Karhap\u00e4\u00e4 was buried at the Kokonniemi cemetery in Ilomantsi, with a large group of people attending, including both Orthodox and Lutheran Christians.<ref name =ort.fi />\n\nThe slandering talk and writings continued even after his death, and the tombstone on his grave was twice thrown into nearby lake. Finally it was cast in concrete.<ref name =ort.fi />\n\nIn 1958, an old man came to Karhap\u00e4\u00e4's brother Jaakko, clothed in a frieze coat. He told him that he was one of the executioners. The old and sickly man suffered from a guilty conscience. Jaakko Karhap\u00e4\u00e4 had a conversation with the man and allowed him to stay the night at his house.<ref name =ort.fi />\n\n==Canonization==\nJohannes Karhap\u00e4\u00e4's name came up when the [[Holy Synod|Synod of Bishops]] of the [[Finnish Orthodox Church]] considered Finns for a possible [[canonization]]. In March 2016, the synod of bishops of the [[Finnish Orthodox Church]] made a proposal on the canonization of Johannes Karhap\u00e4\u00e4 and [[Schema-Igumen John of Valamo|Schema-Igumen John of Valaam (Alekseev)]].

At the turn of the century, the [[Karelian Evangelical Society|Sortavala Evangelical Society]] had initiated a fanatical campaign to convert Orthodox Christians to the Lutheran faith, and as a countermeasure, the [[Karelian Brotherhood]] was founded in [[Olonets]] in 1907, at the initiative of Hieromonk, future Vicar Bishop [[Kiprian (Shnitnikov)]]. The brotherhood quickly established dozens of [[Russian language]] schools in Karelia and published study materials for these schools. The schools became quite popular, partly due to social benefits offered to the student.<ref>{{cite book |title= Kirkon historia.

A. Seyn]] in 1909\u201317, the Karelian Brotherhood was harnessed for the purposes of [[Russification]] of Karelia.<ref name=keinonen>Keinonen, Mikko: ''Oikeauskoisen nousu ja tuho''. Karlik Films, 2008. Viitattu 9.9.2016.</ref>\n\nKarhap\u00e4\u00e4 also got worried about the growing Lutheran mission work in his home area, and in 1906, he approached [[Patriarch Sergius of Moscow|Archbishop (''later'' patriarch of Moscow) Sergius]] of Finland in a letter. He asked for help in defending Orthodoxy and expressed a wish to have a school in Sonkajanranta.<ref name=keinonen/> As a result of Karhap\u00e4\u00e4's activity, an association called Orthodox Association was founded in Sonkajanranta, as a subdivision of the Saints Sergei and Herman Brotherhood. The archbishop gave his blessing to the association to found an Orthodox church school together with the Karelian Brotherhood. A school was built in Sonkajanranta the following year, with the [[Finnish language]] as the medium of instruction. By 1911, the school operated four classes. Poor students as well as those coming from farther away had a possibility to live and dine at the school, and the school was also used to house teaching, enlightenment and festive occasions for the adult population.<ref name =ort.fi />\n\nWorking for the Saints Sergei and Herman Brotherhood, Karhap\u00e4\u00e4 also engaged himself as a [[catechist]] in Ilomantsi, going around with Hieromonk Isaaki of the [[Valamo Monastery]], selling prints and literature and conducting popular Christian events, and in 1914 the [[Viipuri Spiritual Consistory]] appointed the self-taught Karhap\u00e4\u00e4 to be a religion teacher for the entire [[Kuopio Province]], with his salary being paid for by the Grand Duchy of Finland.<ref name =ort.fi /> Karhap\u00e4\u00e4's activity was the greatest from the beginning of [[World War I]]. However, at the same time he accumulated more and more enemies, and he was labelled as henchman of the tsarist regime and even a spy employed by the [[Okhrana]].<ref name=keinonen/>\n\nThe situation of the Sonkajanranta school became more difficult when Vicar Bishop Kiprian died in 1914 and the Karelian Brotherhood was paralyzed. However, the following year the [[St. Petersburg]] merchant Nesteror donated 10&nbsp;000 [[roubles]] to the school and to the building of a church next to it. The church was completed in the autumn of 1915 and consecrated to the memory of [[Anna the Prophetess]]. The blueprint for the church was drawn by monk Gennadi from the Valamo Monastery.<ref name =ort.fi /> The church was not under the jurisdiction of the [[Ilomantsi Orthodox Parish]] but under that of the Karelian Brotherhood.<ref name=keinonen/>\n\nKarhap\u00e4\u00e4's input in the school and church projects was significant, and because of his exemplary activities in church and enlightenment work, he received a number of distinctions. However, new malicious rumours were circulated about him, and his activities aroused much hatred among the local [[Fennoman movement|Fennomen]], as he was considered to be a propagator of the \u2033Russian faith\u2033 (Finnish:\u2033Ryss\u00e4n usko\u2033, the word ''[[ryss\u00e4]]'' being [[racist slur]] for Russian).<ref name=keinonen/> He was especially hated for having in 1912 received Governor-general Seyn at his home. During the visit Seyn had advised Karhap\u00e4\u00e4 to apply for funds from the government so that a proper road could be constructed to the school. After the [[Russian Revolution]] in 1917, accusations against Karhap\u00e4\u00e4 intensified, and he was called a henchman of the tsarist regime and a snoop and a [[Bolshevist]]. It was even said that he had an influence on who would be appointed priests in his home region.<ref name =ort.fi /> It was also known that Karhap\u00e4\u00e4 was a supporter of the [[Emperor of All Russia|Tsar]].<ref name=keinonen/>\n\n===In trouble in the 1910s===\nKarhap\u00e4\u00e4 had been slandered and calumniated in may ways since 1910. At that time the [[Kemi]] newspaper ''[[Per\u00e4-Pohjolainen]]'' claimed that Karhap\u00e4\u00e4 and his father were in favour of the Russian anti-Finnish policies and called them \u201cmiserable Finns\u201d.<ref name =ort.fi />\n\nAfter the Russian Revolution, the slandering became more intense. In the Fennoman papers of [[North Karelia]], e.g. in ''[[Karjalan Sanomat]]'', he was called \u201cone of the dark powers of North Karelia\u201d,<ref name=keinonen/> and his mission travels and his decorations were made fun of. It was claimed that he sowed hatred and discord among the Karelian population, which according to the claims was not properly aware of its true faith and ethnicity. In addition to this, he was called a strong and ruthless advocate of Russification, who supposedly wanted to lead all Finns into subjugation to Russia. It was also claimed that he considered himself to be a [[martyr]] and that he caused fear in the local population and that he ridiculed the Christian faith and other sacred things and that he deceived simple persons. Similar accusations were levelled at his father and brother. However, Karhap\u00e4\u00e4 himself did not answer these accusations and slandering.<ref name =ort.fi /> According to professor of Church history [[Kauko Pirinen]], this criticism was untoward, since Karhap\u00e4\u00e4's only motivation was his deep religious conviction.<ref name=keinonen />\n\nFinally he began to be opposed among the Orthodox faithful as well. Just before [[Easter]] 1917, a meeting of the people of the Ilomantsi Orthodox Parish condemned Karhap\u00e4\u00e4 and the Sonkajanranta school as non-national oppression, which was mixed with religion. It was demanded that Karhap\u00e4\u00e4 be dismissed from his positions of positions of trust and from the parish council. In the autumn of 1917, he also lost the support of Archbishop Serafim, and he was dismissed from his position as a teacher.<ref name =ort.fi /> The schools of the Karelian Brotherhood in [[Karelia (historical province of Finland)|Ladoga Karelia]] were turned over to the local municipalities, in Sonkajanranta in the autumn of 1917, a fierce nationalist [[J\u00e4ger Movement|J\u00e4ger]] from near by Kovero became its teacher. When Karhap\u00e4\u00e4 soon after this lost the support of Archbishop Serafim, he became practically an outlaw in the turmoil of the [[Finnish Civil War]].<ref name=keinonen />\n\n===Imprisonment and death===\nIn March 1918, Karhap\u00e4\u00e4 and his brother Jaakko were ordered to the [[Posse comitatus|call-up]] of the [[White Guard (Finland)|White Guards]] to the Tuupovaara Primary School. There they were arrested on the basis of a tip-off. An incriminating piece of evidence was a small icon, found in the pocket of Karhap\u00e4\u00e4's coat, intended for use school instruction. Karhap\u00e4\u00e4 was allowed to visit his home and bid farewell to his family, but then he was taken to Joensuu, at gunpoint. During a stop at a nearby house, Karhap\u00e4\u00e4 told the lady of the house that his days were numbered. In Joensuu Karhap\u00e4\u00e4 and his brother were locked up in the basement of the [[Joensuu Town Hall]] together with other prisoners.<ref name =ort.fi />\n\nIn early March 1918, Karhap\u00e4\u00e4 was taken to the Siilainen neighbourhood of Joensuu, where he was executed. At the time, executions were carried out randomly and without a trial, the executioners often being drunk. The local military districts were unable to curb the White Guards\u2019 urge to carry out executions. Karhap\u00e4\u00e4 and the others to be executed were ordered in a row, and five executioners fired a [[Volley fire|volley]]. It is said that Karhap\u00e4\u00e4 did not die instantly, and another volley was needed to finish him off. In his tombstone, the date of death is given as August 8.<ref name =ort.fi />\n\nIn the database [[War Victims of Finland 1914\u20131922]], the date of Karhap\u00e4\u00e4's death is recorded as March 7.<ref name=narc /> However, according to other data, he would have been executed some three weeks later, around Easter, and according to yet other data, only on 14 April together with 99 Russians taken prisoners during the [[Battle of Rautu (1918)|Battle of Rautu]].<ref name=loima>{{cite book |title= Ven\u00e4l\u00e4issurmat Suomessa vuosina 1914\u201322 |trans-title = \u2018Russians killed in Finland during 1914\u201322\u2019 |id = |last= Loima |first= Jyrki |authorlink= |year= 2004 |publisher= Prime Minister's Office (Finland) |location= Helsinki |isbn= 952-53544-5-8\n |page= Pa |pages= |chapter= Part 2.2.

The body was identified from the stripes of the woollen socks. Karhap\u00e4\u00e4 was buried at the Kokonniemi cemetery in Ilomantsi, with a large group of people attending, including both Orthodox and Lutheran Christians.<ref name =ort.fi />\n\nThe slandering talk and writings continued even after his death, and the tombstone on his grave was twice thrown into nearby lake. Finally it was cast in concrete.<ref name =ort.fi />\n\nIn 1958, an old man came to Karhap\u00e4\u00e4's brother Jaakko, clothed in a frieze coat. He told him that he was one of the executioners. The old and sickly man suffered from a guilty conscience. Jaakko Karhap\u00e4\u00e4 had a conversation with the man and allowed him to stay the night at his house.<ref name =ort.fi />\n\n==Canonization==\nJohannes Karhap\u00e4\u00e4's name came up when the [[Holy Synod|Synod of Bishops]] of the [[Finnish Orthodox Church]] considered Finns for a possible [[canonization]]. In March 2016, the synod of bishops of the [[Finnish Orthodox Church]] made a proposal on the canonization of Johannes Karhap\u00e4\u00e4 and [[Schema-Igumen John of Valamo|Schema-Igumen John of Valaam (Alekseev)]].

Maria Tarn herself came from a missionary family, and her first husband was Samuel Dyer, an LMS missionary.\n\nSamuel Dyer worked in Penang from 1827 to 1845 and then at Malacca and Singapore, and produced a \u2018Vocabulary of the Hok-kien Dialect\u2019. Maria had three children from her first marriage, all who were born in Penang and who later became missionaries in China. Their daughter, Maria Dyer eventually married an even more famous missionary, [[James Hudson Taylor]], founder of the China Inland Mission.\n\nAfter Dyer\u2019s death in Macao, Maria returned to Penang in 1843 to take over the LMS Chinese girl\u2019s school. Here, she met Bausum and the two married in 1845. In view of Mrs. Bausum\u2019s previous contributions as the wife of an LMS missionary, the London Missionary Society decided to allow the Bausums to make use of the property in exchange for its upkeep. Maria Bausum died in 1946, and her epithet states that\n\n\u2018She devoted her life to the extension of Christ\u2019s Kingdom among the Chinese females in the Straits....\u2019\n\nAfter Maria\u2019s death, Bausum married Jemima Poppy, a missionary who had come to Penang to work in women\u2019s education.

In the presence of his \"superiors by birth and education\" Hitler made a sincere effort to \"present his thoughts in as impressive manner as possible\".<ref name=\"Speer\"/> Speer noted that \"we must remember that this collection includes only those passages in Hitler's monologues\u2014they took up one to two hours every day\u2014which struck Picker as significant. Complete transcripts would reinforce the sense of stifling boredom\".{{fact|date=February 2019}}\n\nAccording to historian [[Max Domarus]], Hitler insisted on absolute silence when he delivered his monologues. No one was allowed to interrupt or contradict him. [[Magda Goebbels]] reported to [[Galeazzo Ciano]]: \"It is always Hitler who talks! He can be [[F\u00fchrer]] as much as he likes, but he always repeats himself and bores his guests\".<ref Name=\"Domarus\"/> [[Ian Kershaw]] reports: <blockquote>Some of the guests\u2014among them Goebbels, G\u00f6ring, and Speer\u2014were regulars. Others were newcomers or were seldom invited. The talk was often of world affairs. But Hitler would tailor the discussion to those present. He was careful in what he said. He consciously set out to impress his opinion on his guests, perhaps at times to gauge their reaction. Sometimes he dominated the 'conversation' with a monologue. At other times, he was content to listen while Goebbels sparred with another guest, or a more general discussion unfolded. Sometimes the table talk was interesting. New guests could find the occasion exciting and Hitler's comments a 'revelation'. Frau Below, the wife of the [[Nicolaus von Below|new Luftwaffe-Adjutant]], found the atmosphere, and Hitler's company, at first exhilarating and was greatly impressed by his knowledge of history and art. But for the household staff who had heard it all many times, the midday meal was often a tedious affair.<ref name=\"Nemesis33\"/></blockquote>\n\nAfter the war, Albert Speer referred to the table talks as \"rambling nonsense\", adding: <blockquote>[Hitler] was that classic German type known as ''[[Besserwisser]]'', the know-it-all. His mind was cluttered with minor information and misinformation, about everything. I believe that one of the reasons he gathered so many flunkies around him was that his instinct told him that first-rate people couldn't possibly stomach the outpourings.<ref>O'Donnell, James Preston (1978).

I didn't know that Julian the Apostate had passed judgment with such clear-sightedness on Christianity and Christians&nbsp;[...] the Galilean, who later was called the Christ, intended something quite different. He must be regarded as a popular leader who took up His position against Jewry&nbsp;[...] and it's certain that Jesus was not a Jew.

In the presence of his \"superiors by birth and education\" Hitler made a sincere effort to \"present his thoughts in as impressive manner as possible\".<ref name=\"Speer\"/> Speer noted that \"we must remember that this collection includes only those passages in Hitler's monologues\u2014they took up one to two hours every day\u2014which struck Picker as significant. Complete transcripts would reinforce the sense of stifling boredom\".{{fact|date=February 2019}}\n\nAccording to historian [[Max Domarus]], Hitler insisted on absolute silence when he delivered his monologues. No one was allowed to interrupt or contradict him. [[Magda Goebbels]] reported to [[Galeazzo Ciano]]: \"It is always Hitler who talks! He can be [[F\u00fchrer]] as much as he likes, but he always repeats himself and bores his guests\".<ref Name=\"Domarus\"/> [[Ian Kershaw]] reports: <blockquote>Some of the guests\u2014among them Goebbels, G\u00f6ring, and Speer\u2014were regulars. Others were newcomers or were seldom invited. The talk was often of world affairs. But Hitler would tailor the discussion to those present. He was careful in what he said. He consciously set out to impress his opinion on his guests, perhaps at times to gauge their reaction. Sometimes he dominated the 'conversation' with a monologue. At other times, he was content to listen while Goebbels sparred with another guest, or a more general discussion unfolded. Sometimes the table talk was interesting. New guests could find the occasion exciting and Hitler's comments a 'revelation'. Frau Below, the wife of the [[Nicolaus von Below|new Luftwaffe-Adjutant]], found the atmosphere, and Hitler's company, at first exhilarating and was greatly impressed by his knowledge of history and art. But for the household staff who had heard it all many times, the midday meal was often a tedious affair.<ref name=\"Nemesis33\"/></blockquote>\n\nAfter the war, Albert Speer referred to the table talks as \"rambling nonsense\", adding: <blockquote>[Hitler] was that classic German type known as ''[[Besserwisser]]'', the know-it-all. His mind was cluttered with minor information and misinformation, about everything. I believe that one of the reasons he gathered so many flunkies around him was that his instinct told him that first-rate people couldn't possibly stomach the outpourings.<ref>O'Donnell, James Preston (1978).
