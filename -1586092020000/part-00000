FC Kaiserslautern]], where won the [[1989\u201390 DFB-Pokal|German Cup in 1990]] and the [[1990\u201391 Bundesliga|league title in 1991]]. He went on to play over 150 matches for the club over seven years before joining [[SG Wattenscheid 09]] in July 1991. He played at Wattenscheid for just one season, but he was so impressive during that time that it led to him being signed by [[FC Bayern Munich]] in the Summer of 1992. At Bayern, he was a first-team regular and helped the club win the [[1993\u201394 Bundesliga|1994 Bundesliga title]] and two [[Fuji-Cup]]s, in 1994 and 1995. He then moved to [[Eintracht Frankfurt]] in 1995 where he had moderate personal success but won no major honours as he left the club after just one season to play for [[Hamburger SV]].

FC Kaiserslautern]], where won the [[1989\u201390 DFB-Pokal|German Cup in 1990]] and the [[1990\u201391 Bundesliga|league title in 1991]]. He went on to play over 150 matches for the club over seven years before joining [[SG Wattenscheid 09]] in July 1991. He played at Wattenscheid for just one season, but he was so impressive during that time that it led to him being signed by [[FC Bayern Munich]] in the Summer of 1992. At Bayern, he was a first-team regular and helped the club win the [[1993\u201394 Bundesliga|1994 Bundesliga title]] and two [[Fuji-Cup]]s, in 1994 and 1995. He then moved to [[Eintracht Frankfurt]] in 1995 where he had moderate personal success but won no major honours as he left the club after just one season to play for [[Hamburger SV]]. He was by no means a first-team regular at Hamburg and had a short loan spell at [[FC Basel]] in 1997.

Instead, they are planning to get their daughter married to wealthy businessman Prem Rajendra Bharadwaj. At the day of the wedding, there's a great dancing contest and to allow Simar to participate in it without disturbing their parents, Roli takes Simar's place until the latter returns. However, Simar is late and thus, dressed up and veiled Roli is forced to marry Prem. This creates problems, as Simar and Prem love each other and Roli is in love with Siddhand. After some time, everybody unites with the person he/she loves and both Simar and Roli are accepted in Bharadwaj House. Nirmala ([[Jayati Bhatia]]), Simar and Roli's grandmother-in-law and family [[matriarch]] and Rajendra and Sujata, their parents-in-law, have deep trust in the sisters and always support them but Pari, Uma and Khushi, the other daughter-in-laws of the Bharadwajs, are jealous of them as they do not get such attention and respect due to their craftiness and greed and try to create difficulties in their lives from time to time. Simar is unable to conceive again after a [[miscarriage]] and Khushi ([[Jyotsna Chandola]]) agrees to become a [[surrogate mother]] of Prem and Simar's child. A daughter named Anjali is born and the Bharadwajs look after her with much love and care. But later, Roli has a car accident and unintentionally runs over a woman named Sunaina. While looking around the place of the accident for clues, Simar is kidnapped by Sunaina's husband Vikrant and forced to leave her family and look after his daughter Sanjana.\n\n===2 years later===\nSimar returns to her family to find out Prem has remarried to another woman named Surabhi ([[Nehalaxmi Iyer]]). Simar, Roli, Prem and Siddhant also have to cope up with a [[supernatural]] creature: Sunaina's [[spirit]] who has returned for a revenge, and also with Vikrant, who falls in love with Simar. Eventually, Sunaina and Surabhi (who tries to kill Simar), are banished. Vikrant tries to murder Prem and is sent to jail. Sanjana is adopted by Simar and Prem.\n\nLater, the story revolves around Simar, Roli, Prem and Siddhant and how they protect Bharadwaj House from some [[supernatural]] creatures who want to destroy them. These [[supernatural]] creatures include Sunaina's [[soul]], [[ichchhadhari naagin|a shapeshifting female serpent]] named Maya ([[Sara Khan (TV actress)|Sara Khan]]), daayans named Mohini (late [[Pratyusha Banerjee]]) and Indravati, Patali [[Devi]]-Gayatri, [[ghosts]] named Maalti, Madhavi and Chhoti Dulhan (Young Bride), [[Shaitan]] ([[Kaal]]), a [[Moon]] Jewel (Princess) named Chandramani and another two daayans named Mahamaya and Kamya. During defeating Patali [[Devi]]-Gayatri and [[Kaal]], Simar's life gets in danger. To protect her elder sister, Roli sacrifices her life and she dies. After Roli's sad demise, Siddhand is remarried to Prerna ([[Mansi Srivastava]]), Simar's childhood friend and moves abroad with her. To gain his powers back and return to the world, [[Kaal]], with the help of some [[witches]], among which are Mahamaya and Kamya, casts a spell on Simar and impregnates her with a child possessing evil powers. Simar has no other option but to leave Bharadwaj House with her newborn son Piyush.\n\n===16 years later===\nAfter major time leaps, the story shows Simar ([[Keerti Gaekwad Kelkar]]) and Piyush ([[Varun Sharma]]) returning to Bharadwaj House and reuniting with their family. Simar and Prem ([[Dheeraj Dhoopar]]/[[Mazher Sayed]])'s daughter Anjali ([[Vaishali Takkar]]), brought up by Bharadwaj's treacherous and crafty daughter-in-law Khushi, has grown up to be a spoilt and selfish fashionista, who blames her mother for abandoning her. Simar and Prem together help their children in their lives. They marry Anjali to Vikram Sanjeev Agarwal (Siddharth Shivpuri) and later Piyush to his best friend Roshni Sumit Kapoor (Nikki Sharma). After Simar helps Anjali managing her marriage, Anjali accepts her mother.\n\n[[Kaal]] awakens on Piyush's 25th birthday, possessing him, and killing Roshni's father, Sumit Kapoor ([[Rushad Rana]]), but is finally defeated by a [[sorceress (fantasy)|sorceress]] named Ridhima. Later, Anjali is divorces her husband and returns to the Bharadwaj House. Sanjana ([[Krissann Barretto]]) returns to Bharadwaj House from [[London]], where she was sent years ago to pursue higher studies. Upon realising Sanjana and her college friend Sameer Dhanraj Kapoor ([[Rohan Mehra]])'s mutual feelings, the Bharadwajs fix their marriage. However, Anjali discovers that Sameer is a fraud who is conspiring against the Bharadwajs and to spare herself from the same fate, she marries Sameer in a secret ceremony. She humiliates her family members and treats them like servants. She even slaps her mother Simar. After Piyush plots a master plan to get the Bharadwajs property back from Anjali, she threatens to kill her own mother but is stopped by Simar who shoots her and Anjali falls into a coma.\n\nBhairavi ([[Vandana Vithlani]]), Sameer's mother is revealed to have shot Anjali. Together with Sameer, she enters the Bharadwajs' lives to avenge Prem for running her husband and Sameer's father over. It is subsequently revealed than Bhairavi murdered him herself after he discovered she was a drug dealer and is using the Bharadwajs as a cover-up. After absorbing [[supernatural]] powers, Bhairavi turns into a ''daayan'' and kills Simar, leaving the Bharadwajs heartbroken. However, the Mother [[Goddess]] [[Durga]], deeply worshipped by the Bharadwaj Family, enters their household in the form of Simar, to destroy Bhairavi and bring Simar back to life. After her defeat, Bhairavi is arrested. Sameer repents for his mistakes and the Bharadwajs forgive and accept him after realising he truly loves Sanjana. Anjali wakes up from coma and asks forgiveness from all the family members but in reality, her purpose is taking Sameer away from Sanjana. Her intentions are revealed when she tries to kill her new fianc\u00e8e Sahil and set Bharadwaj Mansion on fire, and she is arrested. Simar considers her daughter dead and asks the other family members to forget about her. The Saga of the Mystery Box begins, leading to Aaliya, who shoots Roshni with a gun to avenge her father's death who had committed suicide due to Piyush's mistake, and Roshni sadly dies, leaving the family in sadness and making Piyush mad.\n\n6 months pass after Roshni's sad demise. The show portrays the story of Simar and Prem searching for their son Piyush who got lost after Roshni's death 6 months prior, and managing the married life of their adopted daughter, Sanjana. Simar finds out that Piyush has lost his memory and is being looked after by a girl named Avni ([[Monica Sharma]]) and her mother, Hema. Simar takes her son back to Bharadwaj House together with Avni and Hema. Bhairavi has returned from jail and is living with Sameer and Sanjana, but is actually plotting her revenge, having paid Avni and Hema to kidnap Piyush and destroy the Bharadwaj Family. Sanjana loses her unborn child. When Avni tries to expose Bhairavi, the latter attempts to kill her but only succeeds in murdering Avni's mother. Bhairavi shooting a gun leads to Piyush regaining his memory. In the end, Simar kills Bhairavi and Piyush marries Avni, promising her that he would always be by her side. The Bharadwajs worship the Mother [[Goddess]] and celebrate togetherness. Pari apologises to Simar for her past mistakes. Simar also remembers her sister Roli and Nirmala says that the Bharadwaj Family is not only a family but a thought.\n\n==Cast==\n{{cleanup|section|date=February 2018|reason=Section needs to be brought into conformity with [[WP:TVCAST]] to reflect the entire history of the cast, not just the most current lineup.

Instead, they are planning to get their daughter married to wealthy businessman Prem Rajendra Bharadwaj. At the day of the wedding, there's a great dancing contest and to allow Simar to participate in it without disturbing their parents, Roli takes Simar's place until the latter returns. However, Simar is late and thus, dressed up and veiled Roli is forced to marry Prem. This creates problems, as Simar and Prem love each other and Roli is in love with Siddhand. After some time, everybody unites with the person he/she loves and both Simar and Roli are accepted in Bharadwaj House. Nirmala ([[Jayati Bhatia]]), Simar and Roli's grandmother-in-law and family [[matriarch]] and Rajendra and Sujata, their parents-in-law, have deep trust in the sisters and always support them but Pari, Uma and Khushi, the other daughter-in-laws of the Bharadwajs, are jealous of them as they do not get such attention and respect due to their craftiness and greed and try to create difficulties in their lives from time to time. Simar is unable to conceive again after a [[miscarriage]] and Khushi ([[Jyotsna Chandola]]) agrees to become a [[surrogate mother]] of Prem and Simar's child. A daughter named Anjali is born and the Bharadwajs look after her with much love and care. But later, Roli has a car accident and unintentionally runs over a woman named Sunaina. While looking around the place of the accident for clues, Simar is kidnapped by Sunaina's husband Vikrant and forced to leave her family and look after his daughter Sanjana.\n\n===2 years later===\nSimar returns to her family to find out Prem has remarried to another woman named Surabhi ([[Nehalaxmi Iyer]]). Simar, Roli, Prem and Siddhant also have to cope up with a [[supernatural]] creature: Sunaina's [[spirit]] who has returned for a revenge, and also with Vikrant, who falls in love with Simar. Eventually, Sunaina and Surabhi (who tries to kill Simar), are banished. Vikrant tries to murder Prem and is sent to jail. Sanjana is adopted by Simar and Prem.\n\nLater, the story revolves around Simar, Roli, Prem and Siddhant and how they protect Bharadwaj House from some [[supernatural]] creatures who want to destroy them. These [[supernatural]] creatures include Sunaina's [[soul]], [[ichchhadhari naagin|a shapeshifting female serpent]] named Maya ([[Sara Khan (TV actress)|Sara Khan]]), daayans named Mohini (late [[Pratyusha Banerjee]]) and Indravati, Patali [[Devi]]-Gayatri, [[ghosts]] named Maalti, Madhavi and Chhoti Dulhan (Young Bride), [[Shaitan]] ([[Kaal]]), a [[Moon]] Jewel (Princess) named Chandramani and another two daayans named Mahamaya and Kamya. During defeating Patali [[Devi]]-Gayatri and [[Kaal]], Simar's life gets in danger. To protect her elder sister, Roli sacrifices her life and she dies. After Roli's sad demise, Siddhand is remarried to Prerna ([[Mansi Srivastava]]), Simar's childhood friend and moves abroad with her. To gain his powers back and return to the world, [[Kaal]], with the help of some [[witches]], among which are Mahamaya and Kamya, casts a spell on Simar and impregnates her with a child possessing evil powers. Simar has no other option but to leave Bharadwaj House with her newborn son Piyush.\n\n===16 years later===\nAfter major time leaps, the story shows Simar ([[Keerti Gaekwad Kelkar]]) and Piyush ([[Varun Sharma]]) returning to Bharadwaj House and reuniting with their family. Simar and Prem ([[Dheeraj Dhoopar]]/[[Mazher Sayed]])'s daughter Anjali ([[Vaishali Takkar]]), brought up by Bharadwaj's treacherous and crafty daughter-in-law Khushi, has grown up to be a spoilt and selfish fashionista, who blames her mother for abandoning her. Simar and Prem together help their children in their lives. They marry Anjali to Vikram Sanjeev Agarwal (Siddharth Shivpuri) and later Piyush to his best friend Roshni Sumit Kapoor (Nikki Sharma). After Simar helps Anjali managing her marriage, Anjali accepts her mother.\n\n[[Kaal]] awakens on Piyush's 25th birthday, possessing him, and killing Roshni's father, Sumit Kapoor ([[Rushad Rana]]), but is finally defeated by a [[sorceress (fantasy)|sorceress]] named Ridhima. Later, Anjali is divorces her husband and returns to the Bharadwaj House. Sanjana ([[Krissann Barretto]]) returns to Bharadwaj House from [[London]], where she was sent years ago to pursue higher studies. Upon realising Sanjana and her college friend Sameer Dhanraj Kapoor ([[Rohan Mehra]])'s mutual feelings, the Bharadwajs fix their marriage. However, Anjali discovers that Sameer is a fraud who is conspiring against the Bharadwajs and to spare herself from the same fate, she marries Sameer in a secret ceremony. She humiliates her family members and treats them like servants. She even slaps her mother Simar. After Piyush plots a master plan to get the Bharadwajs property back from Anjali, she threatens to kill her own mother but is stopped by Simar who shoots her and Anjali falls into a coma.\n\nBhairavi ([[Vandana Vithlani]]), Sameer's mother is revealed to have shot Anjali. Together with Sameer, she enters the Bharadwajs' lives to avenge Prem for running her husband and Sameer's father over. It is subsequently revealed than Bhairavi murdered him herself after he discovered she was a drug dealer and is using the Bharadwajs as a cover-up. After absorbing [[supernatural]] powers, Bhairavi turns into a ''daayan'' and kills Simar, leaving the Bharadwajs heartbroken. However, the Mother [[Goddess]] [[Durga]], deeply worshipped by the Bharadwaj Family, enters their household in the form of Simar, to destroy Bhairavi and bring Simar back to life. After her defeat, Bhairavi is arrested. Sameer repents for his mistakes and the Bharadwajs forgive and accept him after realising he truly loves Sanjana. Anjali wakes up from coma and asks forgiveness from all the family members but in reality, her purpose is taking Sameer away from Sanjana. Her intentions are revealed when she tries to kill her new fianc\u00e8e Sahil and set Bharadwaj Mansion on fire, and she is arrested. Simar considers her daughter dead and asks the other family members to forget about her. The Saga of the Mystery Box begins, leading to Aaliya, who shoots Roshni with a gun to avenge her father's death who had committed suicide due to Piyush's mistake, and Roshni sadly dies, leaving the family in sadness and making Piyush mad.\n\n6 months pass after Roshni's sad demise. The show portrays the story of Simar and Prem searching for their son Piyush who got lost after Roshni's death 6 months prior, and managing the married life of their adopted daughter, Sanjana. Simar finds out that Piyush has lost his memory and is being looked after by a girl named Avni ([[Monica Sharma]]) and her mother, Hema. Simar takes her son back to Bharadwaj House together with Avni and Hema. Bhairavi has returned from jail and is living with Sameer and Sanjana, but is actually plotting her revenge, having paid Avni and Hema to kidnap Piyush and destroy the Bharadwaj Family. Sanjana loses her unborn child. When Avni tries to expose Bhairavi, the latter attempts to kill her but only succeeds in murdering Avni's mother. Bhairavi shooting a gun leads to Piyush regaining his memory. In the end, Simar kills Bhairavi and Piyush marries Avni, promising her that he would always be by her side. The Bharadwajs worship the Mother [[Goddess]] and celebrate togetherness. Pari apologises to Simar for her past mistakes. Simar also remembers her sister Roli and Nirmala says that the Bharadwaj Family is not only a family but a thought.\n\n==Cast==\n{{cleanup|section|date=February 2018|reason=Section needs to be brought into conformity with [[WP:TVCAST]] to reflect the entire history of the cast, not just the most current lineup. Former main cast members need to be moved back to the top of the Main cast section. Former recurring cast need to be moved back to the top of the Recurring cast section, as cast members do not cease to be of academic importance just because they've left the series or have been written off. \"Supernatural cast\" is not a valid subsection. Any significant \"supernatural cast\" member should be moved to either the Main or Recurring sections.

As its common name suggests, it is widely described as attacking tobacco plants of the ''[[Nicotiana]]'' species, but it also favors cotton, [[alfalfa]], [[clover]]s, [[soybean]], and [[flax]] plants. In addition to crop plants, it is a common pest of vegetables and fruits such as [[cabbage]], [[cantaloupe]], [[lettuce]], [[pea]], and [[tomato]] plants. Aside from plants that are grown for agricultural reasons, ''H. virescens'' larvae also attack flower crops such as [[geranium]] and a large variety of weeds.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nAfter eggs are laid on the host plant's leaves and hatch, the larvae may chew small holes in the leaves before they reach the buds. They then damage the bud or growing tip of the plant. The leaves that expand from the buds are often ragged and distorted as a result.<ref name=\":0\" /> \n[[Image:Heliothis virescens damage.jpg|thumb|left|273x273px|Damage by Tobacco budworm on ''[[Nicotiana tabacum]]'']]Host plant preference seems to differ by region or habitat. In Mississippi, [[Geranium|cranesbill]] is the key early season host plant. In Texas, cotton is the principle host plant, but [[Nicotiana rustica|wild tobacco]], [[Verbena|vervain]], [[ruellia]], and [[Malva|mallow]] are all important hosts as well. Studies in [[Florida]] show that ''H. virescens'' prefer tobacco more highly than other field crops and vegetables, but cabbage, [[Collard greens|collards]], [[okra]], and tomato were all still attacked. However, it is notable that cotton was not present in this study.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nMovements between host plants throughout generations of ''H. virescens'' have been observed in a widespread number of environments. For example, in Georgia, the first two generations of ''H. virescens'' of the year (in around April and May) develop primarily on [[toadflax]], but the third generation (in June and July) prefers [[Muhlenbergia rigens|deergrass]]. Future generations (between July to October) prefer [[Desmodium incanum|beggarweed]] to other host plants.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nOther recorded food plants include ''[[Penstemon laevigatus]]'', ''[[Desmodium]]'' species, ''[[Lespedeza bicolor]]'', ''[[Medicago lupulina]]'', ''[[Geranium dissectum]]'', ''[[Rhexia]]'' species, ''[[Rumex]]'' species, ''[[Physalis]]'' species, ''[[Lonicera japonica]]'', ''[[Lupinus]]'' species, ''[[Ipomoea]]'' species, ''Jacquemontia tamnifolia'', ''[[Passiflora]]'' species, ''Sida spinosa'', ''[[Helianthus]]'' species, ''[[Linaria canadensis]],'' and ''[[Abutilon theophrasti]]''.\n\n== Oviposition ==\n''Heliothis virescens'' lays its eggs on the leaves of its host plants; upon hatching, larvae migrate to the terminal area and then to the buds to feed.<ref name=\":0\" /> It has been shown that there is maternal inheritance of preferred host plants. Mothers that have been raised on certain plants generally prefer to oviposit their eggs on the same species of plant.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Karpinski|first=Anne|last2=Haenniger|first2=Sabine|last3=Sch\u00f6fl|first3=Gerhard|last4=Heckel|first4=David G.|last5=Groot|first5=Astrid T.|date=2014-11-01|title=Host plant specialization in the generalist moth Heliothis virescens and the role of egg imprinting|journal=Evolutionary Ecology|language=en|volume=28|issue=6|pages=1075\u20131093|doi=10.1007/s10682-014-9723-x|issn=0269-7653}}</ref>\n\n== Life cycle ==\nThe tobacco budworm goes through 4 life stages: [[egg]], [[larva]]l, [[pupa]]l, and adult. The life cycle generally occurs during the warmer months of late spring to early fall, depending on the region that the budworm is found. During this time, ''Heliothis virescens'' can undergo around 4 to 5 generations depending on the region. For larval, pupal, and adult stages, warmer temperatures encourage faster maturation but also faster [[senescence]], while colder climates allow the budworm to mature at a slower rate.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Egg ===\n[[File:Heliothis virescens 5422147.jpg|thumb|Larval form on petunia buds|281x281px]]\nFemales generally produce 300 to 500 eggs in the wild but have been seen to produce 1000 to 1500 eggs on an artificial diet consisting of primarily water, [[Cereal germ|wheat germ]], [[casein]], and [[sucrose]] at cool temperatures in an Arizona study.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite journal|last=Fye|first=R.

They are initially whitish or yellowish and turn grey as they age. With a radius of 0.5 to 0.6 millimeters, eggs are generally spherical with a flattened base where they are attached to the plant. There are 18 to 25 ridges that radiate from the top of the egg. Tobacco budworm eggs are almost indistinguishable from the eggs of the [[Helicoverpa zea|corn earworm]]. In tobacco budworm eggs, primary ribs terminate before they reach the cells surrounding [[Micropyle (botany)|micropyle]], a small pore opening at the top of the egg. On the other hand, corn earworm ridges extend to the rosette.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Larvae ===\n''Heliothis virescens'' larvae usually have 5 to 6 [[instar]]s or moultings, but there have been instances where 7 instars are necessary to reach the pupal stage. Head width of the larvae starts from 0.26&nbsp;mm and grows to 2.87&nbsp;mm by the last instar. Larval length ranges from 1.4&nbsp;mm in the first instar and grows to 36&nbsp;mm by the fifth instar. Larvae are a yellow or yellowish green upon hatching, with a yellowish brown head capsule. During later instars, larvae have variable colors ranging from greenish to pinkish, or even a dark red or maroon with a broad brown head capsule.  Whitish dorsal and ventral bands run down the length of its body, along with a broad lateral band that is generally brown in color. Larvae also have black thorn-like [[Filopodia|microspines]]. Starting from the third or fourth instar, cannibalistic behavior can be observed. Similar to the eggs, early instar ''H. virescens'' larvae are difficult to distinguish from corn earworm larvae, with minor differences such as missing or differing lengths of microspines.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Pupae   ===\n[[Pupa]]tion, or the process of transforming from an immature stage to an adult, occurs in the soil. Pupae start off a shiny reddish-brown that progresses to a dark brown color. The size of a pupa averages 18.2&nbsp;mm to 4.7&nbsp;mm in width. The budworm overwinters in the pupal stage, and [[diapause]] or dormancy can be initiated by either short days or low temperatures.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n[[Image:Tobacco budworm 2.jpg|thumb|left|246x246px|Mounted adult specimen]]\n\n=== Adult ===\n''Heliothis virescens'' moths emerge between March to May in the southern United States. Adults are brownish in color with a light green tinge. The front wings have three dark bands, each associated with a whitish or cream border. [[Insect wing|Hindwings]] are whitish with a dark band at the distal margin. Fully grown adults measure between 28 and 35&nbsp;mm (1.1 to 1.4 inches) in wingspan. Females are generally darker in color than males.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Temperature dependence ===\nDevelopment time and lifespan show a negative correlation with temperature. Higher temperatures result in shorter development times in studies conducted on ''Heliothis'' ''virescens'' raised in a temperature controlled laboratory environment.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nIn the larval stages, development time for the instars required anywhere between 2.6 and 10.1 days at 20&nbsp;\u00b0C. When the temperature was increased to 25&nbsp;\u00b0C instar development times ranged between 1.9 and 5.7 days. Most notably, the later instar development times were nearly halved. The duration of the pupal stage also decreases with increasing temperature: on average, 22 days were required to hatch at 20&nbsp;\u00b0C, while only 13 days were needed at 25&nbsp;\u00b0C, and 11.2 days at 30&nbsp;\u00b0C. Adulthood longevity ranges from 25 days at 20&nbsp;\u00b0C but drops to 15 days at 30&nbsp;\u00b0C.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n== Parasites ==\nThere are high levels of parasitism at all stages of life for the ''Heliothis virescens''.

Adults of this parasitoid were found on the vast majority of tobacco plants, before any tobacco budworm eggs or larvae were found on it. Once tobacco was removed from the plots, parasitism by ''C. nigriceps'' declined. ''C. nigriceps'' generally oviposit its eggs onto small ''Heliothis virescens'' larvae; eggs hatch either at later instars or at the prepupae stage.

It is thought that mating can enhance egg maturation, increase egg production, and induce oviposition due to stimulation of JH production. Mating was correlated with a surge in JH production by the [[corpus allatum]] in females - a 5 to 15 fold increase compared to virgin females, an allototropic effect. Juvenile hormone released by mated females increased 2.5 fold. The profile of the juvenile hormone produced also changed - synthesis of JH II exhibited significant increases, JH I increases but not significantly, and JH III remained the same. In males, juvenile hormone is synthesized in small quantities by accessory sex glands. At birth, males synthesize around 1.5 nanograms of JH I and II; this quantity increases by 12 hours after emergence and remains steady for up to 54 hours after emergence. While mating, males also transfer the juvenile hormone they synthesize to the females they copulate with.

Larvae will also burrow into fruit, but this increased the frequency of plant disease. If there is no reproductive tissue available, ''Heliothis virescens'' will readily feed on leaves.

Females were completely sterilized at the 25 krad treatment. It was also observed that sterility could be inherited; the fecundity of [[F1 hybrid|F1]] females, born from treated females, was still markedly reduced. There was a high female pupal mortality rate that increased with doses of irradiation treatment.

A study in North Carolina collected wild ''Heliothis virescens'' populations and fed some diets containing ''Bacillus thuringiensis'' toxins.

In addition to crop plants, it is a common pest of vegetables and fruits such as [[cabbage]], [[cantaloupe]], [[lettuce]], [[pea]], and [[tomato]] plants. Aside from plants that are grown for agricultural reasons, ''H. virescens'' larvae also attack flower crops such as [[geranium]] and a large variety of weeds.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nAfter eggs are laid on the host plant's leaves and hatch, the larvae may chew small holes in the leaves before they reach the buds.

Adults of this parasitoid were found on the vast majority of tobacco plants, before any tobacco budworm eggs or larvae were found on it. Once tobacco was removed from the plots, parasitism by ''C. nigriceps'' declined. ''C. nigriceps'' generally oviposit its eggs onto small ''Heliothis virescens'' larvae; eggs hatch either at later instars or at the prepupae stage. In the study, ''C. nigriceps'' larvae were collected from tobacco budworm larvae in the late spring.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite journal|last=Martin|first=P.B.|date=1981|url=|journal=Entomophaga|volume=26|issue=4|pages=401\u2013419|doi=10.1007/bf02374715|title=The parasitoid complex of three noctuids &#91;Lep.&#93; in a northern Florida cropping system: Seasonal occurrence, parasitization, alternate hosts, and influence of host-habitat}}</ref>\n\n''[[Meteorus autographae]]'' was as common as ''C. nigriceps'' in larvae collected from [[Trifolium repens|white clover]], and at least ten other parasitoids were recorded between April and October.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n=== Defenses ===\n''Heliothis virescens'' larvae attack ''C. nigriceps'' females that approach with an oral [[exudate]] that causes ''C. nigriceps'' to become agitated and groom themselves, allowing the budworm to escape.

It is thought that mating can enhance egg maturation, increase egg production, and induce oviposition due to stimulation of JH production. Mating was correlated with a surge in JH production by the [[corpus allatum]] in females - a 5 to 15 fold increase compared to virgin females, an allototropic effect. Juvenile hormone released by mated females increased 2.5 fold. The profile of the juvenile hormone produced also changed - synthesis of JH II exhibited significant increases, JH I increases but not significantly, and JH III remained the same. In males, juvenile hormone is synthesized in small quantities by accessory sex glands. At birth, males synthesize around 1.5 nanograms of JH I and II; this quantity increases by 12 hours after emergence and remains steady for up to 54 hours after emergence. While mating, males also transfer the juvenile hormone they synthesize to the females they copulate with. By 6 hours, levels on the female bursa copulatrix decrease dramatically.<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite journal|last=Park|first=Yong Ihl|date=1998|title=Mating in Heliothis virescens: Transfer of Juvenile Hormone During Copulation by Male to Female and Stimulation of Biosynthesis of Endogenous Juvenile Hormone|url=|journal=Archives of Insect Biochemistry and Physiology|volume=38|issue=2|pages=100\u2013107|doi=10.1002/(sici)1520-6327(1998)38:2<100::aid-arch6>3.0.co;2-x}}</ref>\n\n=== Vitellogenin ===\n[[Vitellogenin]] (VG), an egg yolk precursor protein, is dependent on juvenile hormone levels.

Larvae will also burrow into fruit, but this increased the frequency of plant disease. If there is no reproductive tissue available, ''Heliothis virescens'' will readily feed on leaves. Injury of the crop presents very similar patterns and at similar levels as the [[Helicoverpa zea|corn earworm]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n== Management ==\n\n=== Insecticides ===\nPreviously, insecticides such as [[Paris green|Paris Green]] or [[arsenate]]s were used in high enough doses that affected not only the insects they were meant to kill, but also the plants that the insecticides were supposed to be protecting.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\nPart of the reason ''Heliothis virescens'' has proved so difficult to control is because of its ability to rapidly evolve insecticide and pesticide resistance. ''H. virescens'' acquired resistance to [[Dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane|DDT]] a mere 14 years after widespread use, [[carbaryl]] within 10 years, [[pyrethroid]]s in 7, and [[methomyl]] in less than 5 years of intensive use.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\nWhen insecticides are implemented, [[Leaf|foliar]] insecticides are used, but this often also hurts beneficial organisms that control ''Heliothis virescens'' populations, further exacerbating the damage.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Sampling ===\nLarge cone-shaped wire traps are baited with sex [[pheromone]] lures are able to capture adult moths.

Killing larvae already on the weeds is also effective.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Biological control ===\n''Heliothis'' [[Nuclear Polyhedrosis Virus|nuclear polyhedrosis virus]] have been used to suppress populations on field crops and early season weed hosts. Release of [[Trichogramma|''Trichogamma'']] egg parasitoids is beneficial in some vegetable crops.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Multitactic approach ===\nAround the 1980s, a multi-tactic approach was developed, including destruction of weed hosts, biological insecticides, and release of sterile ''Heliothis virescens'' crosses. While these tactics had no immediate effect on the tobacco budworm population, much of the data collected during these control efforts was valuable in control efforts for other pests.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\n=== Irradiation ===\nStudies have been done on the usage of [[reserpine]] and subsequently exposing the moth with [[gamma irradiation]] (treatments ranged from 0 to 25 krad).<ref name=\":6\">{{Cite journal|last=Guerra|first=A.

Fertility (percentage hatched) was dramatically reduced, and greater doses of radiation resulted in a sex imbalance that lowered the proportion of female progeny. Females were completely sterilized at the 25 krad treatment. It was also observed that sterility could be inherited; the fecundity of [[F1 hybrid|F1]] females, born from treated females, was still markedly reduced. There was a high female pupal mortality rate that increased with doses of irradiation treatment. Hatching rates decreased at lower levels of radiation; above 20 krad treatments, eggs ceased to hatch.<ref name=\":6\" />\n\n=== Genetic engineering ===\nCotton has been genetically engineered to express insecticidal proteins (specifically Cry1Ac and Cry1Ab, d-endotoxin proteins of ''[[Bacillus thuringiensis]]'') to resist the budworm.<ref name=\":5\" /> These transgenic cotton plants are remarkably effective, especially considering previous lack of success with insecticides.

A study in North Carolina collected wild ''Heliothis virescens'' populations and fed some diets containing ''Bacillus thuringiensis'' toxins. After just 12 selection episodes, survivors were already 7-fold more resistant to the toxins. It is estimated that the frequency of the resistant allele may be as high as 0.001 in the population.<ref name=\":7\" />\n\nThere have been strategies proposed to delay the rate of resistance development. One strategy proposes mixing transgenic and nontransgenic seeds before packaging them for sale, resulting in a mixed field population. However, studies modeling this situation suggest that ''Heliothis virescens'' larvae will simply ingest sublethal doses of toxin, then move to a nontransgenic plant and recover. Therefore, this strategy may actually hasten the rate of resistance development.<ref name=\":7\" />\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Taxonbar|from=Q5706029}}\n\n[[Category:Heliothis]]\n[[Category:Agricultural pest insects]]\n[[Category:Moths of Canada]]\n", "name_user": "\u00dejarkur", "label": "safe", "comment": "Disamb link", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heliothis_virescens"}

Karen Ross, assisting at TraviCom's headquarters, does not hear back from their team and activates a remote camera, discovering the camp destroyed with numerous corpses, before something large destroys the camera. Karen alerts TraviCom's CEO and Charles' father, R.B. Travis, who informs her that the group was actually searching for a rare blue diamond. Travis implores Karen to lead another expedition to the site to find his son, who is also her former fianc\u00e9.\n\nMeanwhile, Peter Elliott, a [[Primatology|primatologist]] at the [[University of California, Berkeley]], and his assistant Richard teach [[human communication]] to [[primate]]s using a [[mountain gorilla]] named Amy. With a specialized backpack and glove, her [[sign language]] is translated to a digitized voice. Despite the success, Peter is concerned by Amy\u2019s drawings of jungles and the [[Eye of Providence]], and seeks funding to return Amy to Africa, but the university is reluctant. Romanian philanthropist Herkermer Homolka offers to fund the expedition. Having learned of the trip, Karen has been bugging Peter via calls and messages to join his expedition since her visas are worthless without being connected to him. At first he is reluctant and refuses to let her on board, but once Homolka's failed credit almost stops the trip, her money comes in handy to fuel the plane and save the expedition.  \n \nIn Africa, the group meets expert guide Captain Monroe Kelly but are captured by local militia leader Captain Wanta, who grants them passage for a sizable bribe which the well funded Karen again provides. Amy, threatened by the presence of another female near Peter, repeatedly insults Karen. As the group boards another plane, Monroe reveals that Homolka has led previous [[safari]]s in search of the \"Lost City of Zinj\", with disastrous results. The group parachutes into the jungle just before their plane is shot down by Zairean soldiers.\n\nOn the ground, they encounter a native Ghost Tribe. The tribe leads them to Bob Driscoll, a wounded member of Charles' expedition in a [[Catatonia|catatonic]] state. On seeing Amy approaching, Bob begins screaming in fear and soon dies. The group continues by boat, and learn that Homolka, in search of Zinj and its fabled [[King Solomon's Mines|diamond]], believes that Amy's drawings suggest she has seen the mine and can lead them to it. After an attack by massive [[Hippopotamus|hippos]], they find the ruined camp and the nearby City of Zinj. While searching the city, Richard decides to stay outside and he and the guard left with him are killed by a vicious grey gorilla. They take shelter at the ruined camp, keeping other gorillas at bay with a perimeter created with high tech equipment sent by Karen's boss. Homolka announces that he translated the [[hieroglyph]]s, which say, \"We are watching you\".\n\nWhen day breaks, they find Homolka, several aides and Amy missing. Agreeing to find and return their human companions first, they return to the city. They surmise from the hieroglyphs that the city\u2019s inhabitants specially bred the grey gorillas, encouraging their violent tendencies to guard the mine and kill anyone looking to steal the diamonds. The group suspects the gorillas turned on their masters yet still continue to protect the mine as trained to do. They find the diamond mine and detecting their presence, the grey gorillas begin to emerge from their caves. Homolka, crazy with greed, begins to collect diamonds as the others try to warn him to leave them for fear of reprisal. Unwilling to leave the diamonds and the prospect of a fortune, he is soon cornered then killed by a pack of gorillas. Monroe, Karen, and Peter fight off the gorillas and flee deeper into the mine, where they discover Charles' body, still holding a giant blue diamond in hand. As Amy protects Peter, Monroe fends the other gorillas off while Karen fits the diamond into a portable laser. The volcano begins to [[Types of volcanic eruptions|erupt]], and Monroe, Karen, Peter and Amy escape as the city is flooded with lava, killing the gorillas.\n\nOnce safe, Karen reports to Travis on finding the diamond and confirming Charles' death. Realizing Travis was only interested in the diamond, she uses her laser to destroy the TraviCom satellite. In the nearby wreckage of another one of Travis' expedition [[Cargo aircraft|cargo plane]] they had found earlier, they find a usable [[Hot air balloon|hot-air balloon]], and prepare to leave. Peter sees Amy with a troop of silverback gorillas and bids her goodbye. The three take off in the balloon, and Karen has Peter throw away the large diamond\u2014he chucks it back into the jungle below. \n\nAmy follows the departing balloon with a sad smile, then runs off to join her new silverback family\u2014home at last.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Laura Linney]] as Karen Ross, an electronics expert for TraviCom, and a former CIA operative, who hopes to find her ex-fianc\u00e9 lost in a previous expedition to the Congo.\n* [[Dylan Walsh]] as Peter Elliott, a [[primatologist]] of [[Berkeley, California]] who wants to return his gorilla, Amy, to her birthplace in the Congo's Virunga region.\n* [[Ernie Hudson]] as Captain Monroe Kelly, the \"Great White Hunter\" and mercenary who leads the group.\n* [[Tim Curry]] as Herkermer Homolka, a [[Romania]]n man who offers to finance the expedition.

Karen Ross, assisting at TraviCom's headquarters, does not hear back from their team and activates a remote camera, discovering the camp destroyed with numerous corpses, before something large destroys the camera. Karen alerts TraviCom's CEO and Charles' father, R.B. Travis, who informs her that the group was actually searching for a rare blue diamond. Travis implores Karen to lead another expedition to the site to find his son, who is also her former fianc\u00e9.\n\nMeanwhile, Peter Elliott, a [[Primatology|primatologist]] at the [[University of California, Berkeley]], and his assistant Richard teach [[human communication]] to [[primate]]s using a [[mountain gorilla]] named Amy. With a specialized backpack and glove, her [[sign language]] is translated to a digitized voice. Despite the success, Peter is concerned by Amy\u2019s drawings of jungles and the [[Eye of Providence]], and seeks funding to return Amy to Africa, but the university is reluctant. Romanian philanthropist Herkermer Homolka offers to fund the expedition. Having learned of the trip, Karen has been bugging Peter via calls and messages to join his expedition since her visas are worthless without being connected to him. At first he is reluctant and refuses to let her on board, but once Homolka's failed credit almost stops the trip, her money comes in handy to fuel the plane and save the expedition.  \n \nIn Africa, the group meets expert guide Captain Monroe Kelly but are captured by local militia leader Captain Wanta, who grants them passage for a sizable bribe which the well funded Karen again provides. Amy, threatened by the presence of another female near Peter, repeatedly insults Karen. As the group boards another plane, Monroe reveals that Homolka has led previous [[safari]]s in search of the \"Lost City of Zinj\", with disastrous results. The group parachutes into the jungle just before their plane is shot down by Zairean soldiers.\n\nOn the ground, they encounter a native Ghost Tribe. The tribe leads them to Bob Driscoll, a wounded member of Charles' expedition in a [[Catatonia|catatonic]] state. On seeing Amy approaching, Bob begins screaming in fear and soon dies. The group continues by boat, and learn that Homolka, in search of Zinj and its fabled [[King Solomon's Mines|diamond]], believes that Amy's drawings suggest she has seen the mine and can lead them to it. After an attack by massive [[Hippopotamus|hippos]], they find the ruined camp and the nearby City of Zinj. While searching the city, Richard decides to stay outside and he and the guard left with him are killed by a vicious grey gorilla. They take shelter at the ruined camp, keeping other gorillas at bay with a perimeter created with high tech equipment sent by Karen's boss. Homolka announces that he translated the [[hieroglyph]]s, which say, \"We are watching you\".\n\nWhen day breaks, they find Homolka, several aides and Amy missing. Agreeing to find and return their human companions first, they return to the city. They surmise from the hieroglyphs that the city\u2019s inhabitants specially bred the grey gorillas, encouraging their violent tendencies to guard the mine and kill anyone looking to steal the diamonds. The group suspects the gorillas turned on their masters yet still continue to protect the mine as trained to do. They find the diamond mine and detecting their presence, the grey gorillas begin to emerge from their caves. Homolka, crazy with greed, begins to collect diamonds as the others try to warn him to leave them for fear of reprisal. Unwilling to leave the diamonds and the prospect of a fortune, he is soon cornered then killed by a pack of gorillas. Monroe, Karen, and Peter fight off the gorillas and flee deeper into the mine, where they discover Charles' body, still holding a giant blue diamond in hand. As Amy protects Peter, Monroe fends the other gorillas off while Karen fits the diamond into a portable laser. The volcano begins to [[Types of volcanic eruptions|erupt]], and Monroe, Karen, Peter and Amy escape as the city is flooded with lava, killing the gorillas.\n\nOnce safe, Karen reports to Travis on finding the diamond and confirming Charles' death. Realizing Travis was only interested in the diamond, she uses her laser to destroy the TraviCom satellite. In the nearby wreckage of another one of Travis' expedition [[Cargo aircraft|cargo plane]] they had found earlier, they find a usable [[Hot air balloon|hot-air balloon]], and prepare to leave. Peter sees Amy with a troop of silverback gorillas and bids her goodbye. The three take off in the balloon, and Karen has Peter throw away the large diamond - he chucks it back into the jungle below. \n\nAmy follows the departing balloon with a sad smile, then runs off to join her new silverback family - home at last.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Laura Linney]] as Karen Ross, an electronics expert for TraviCom, and a former CIA operative, who hopes to find her ex-fianc\u00e9 lost in a previous expedition to the Congo.\n* [[Dylan Walsh]] as Peter Elliott, a [[primatologist]] of [[Berkeley, California]] who wants to return his gorilla, Amy, to her birthplace in the Congo's Virunga region.\n* [[Ernie Hudson]] as Captain Monroe Kelly, the \"Great White Hunter\" and mercenary who leads the group.\n* [[Tim Curry]] as Herkermer Homolka, a [[Romania]]n man who offers to finance the expedition.

However, at excessive levels, radium poisoning can occur. When the body takes in radium, it perceives it as calcium. Consequently, the body fills bones with radium, which can lead to brittle bones, collapsed spines, and teeth to fall out.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.atomicheritage.org/history/radium-girls|title=Radium Girls|last=|first=|date=|website=Atomic Heritage|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=21 February 2020}}</ref>\n\nRadium was discovered in 1898 by [[Marie Curie|Marie]] and [[Pierre Curie]].<ref name=\":2\" /> In the early 1900\u2019s it was used as radiation treatment for cancer. Expansion of radium\u2019s use in medical practices was earnestly attempted in the treatment of [[rheumatism]] and mental disorders.<ref name=\":1\" /> However, these pursuits were unsuccessful.\n\n===== Radium Girls =====\nDue to radium\u2019s [[Luminescence|luminescent]] properties, American inventor [[William Joseph Hammer|William J.

Further application of the paint reached military equipment after the company accepted a contract with the U.S. government during WWI.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nStarting in 1916, the U.S. Radium Corporation established factories in New Jersey that recruited dozens of women to paint the watch dials with Undark.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cnn.com/style/article/radium-girls-radioactive-paint/index.html|title=Radium Girls: The dark times of luminous watches|first=Jacopo |last=Prisco|website=CNN|language=en|access-date=2020-04-05}}</ref> No [[Personal protective equipment|safety equipment]] were given to the women, nor were any precautions taken.<ref name=\":2\" /> The women were instructed to frequently lick the paint brushes, in order to keep them wet and shaped to a fine point. Throughout every day, the women\u2019s clothes and skin were covered in radium paint. This lead to the women developing fatal radium poisoning.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nBy the mid-1920\u2019s dozens upon dozens of these women were falling ill and dying from prolonged, horrific deaths. The radium they ingested was dissolving their bones from the inside, causing severe pain and enormous deformities with pieces of their bodies easily breaking and falling off.

However, this lawsuit was unsuccessful because of U.S. Radium\u2019s vast team of lawyers and contractual affiliation with the U.S. government. The women were so desperate to afford medical treatment and food, that they had to settle for $10,000 each and a $600 annual payment. Unfortunately, all five women passed away within two years after the settlement.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nThe fate of the [[Radium Girls]] raised a lot of national concern for workers\u2019 health rights and conditions. After the incident, precautions and safety equipment were mandated to protect workers handling radioactive material in several occupations. The [[Manhattan Project]] notably used fume hoods, personal protective equipment, sanitation, and frequent checks for contamination, in order to prevent a repeat of the Radium Girls tragedy. In 1949, the U.S. Congress passed a law that compensates workers for occupational illnesses.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n===== Environmental regulation =====\nBy the time World War II began, safety limits for handling radiation had been set by the federal government.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\nIn 1934, the [[International Commission on Radiological Protection]] (ICRP) established a tolerance dose for workers of 0.2 [[Roentgen (unit)|roentgens]] of radiation exposure to workers per day.\u00a0In 1936, the National Committee on Radiation Protection and Measurements (NCRP) reduced the limit to 0.1 roentgens per day which held through World War II.\u00a0From 1936 through 1977 there were continual revisions by professional scientists and the government agencies as to what constituted safe doses. By the end of World War II, arguments between the U.S. military leaders and civilian officials ensued as to what were considered best practices to controlling nuclear energy and repressing fabrication of nuclear weapons by other nations. This led to the dispute in going to congress and resulting in congress passing the [[Atomic Energy Act of 1946|Atomic Energy Act]] (AEA) of 1946.<ref name=\":6\">{{Cite book|author=Institute of Medicine (US) Committee for Review and Evaluation of the Medical Use Program of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK232703/|title=History of Radiation Regulation in Medicine|last2=Gottfried|first2=Kate-Louise D.|last3=Penn|first3=Gary|date=1996|publisher=National Academies Press (US)|language=en}}</ref>\n\nThe EPA was created in 1970 to accept certain functions and responsibilities from other federal agencies and departments. Since its inception, the EPA has run environmental programs that address radioactive waste disposal sites, off-site monitoring around nuclear power plants, and keeps an eye on natural sources of radioactivity, such as radon.<ref name=\":6\" />\n\nThe EPA has developed guidance on topics such as occupational radiation limits and exposures for federal agencies and members of the public.

However, \u201cclean blood,\u201d could not be found from participants because 99% across the globe had derivatives of C8 found in their blood. Instead, samples of preserved blood from American Soldiers during the Korean War were used as the control. The blood was obtained in 1950, a year before Teflon was ever sold to the public. None of the preserved blood was found to contain C8, strongly suggesting that the worldwide use of Teflon caused a nigh-ubiquitous absence of \u201cclean blood.\u201d<ref name=\":8\">{{Cite web|url=http://connect2conserve.org/teflon-and-forever-chemicals/|title=Teflon and Forever Chemicals \u2013 Connect 2 Conserve|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-05}}</ref><ref name=\":9\">{{Cite AV media|url=https://thedevilweknow.com/|title=The Devil We Know|date=2018-01-21|last=Soechtig|first=Stephanie|type=Documentary|language=}}</ref>\n\n===== DuPont and 3M =====\nPFOA has been used to make [[Polytetrafluoroethylene|Teflon]], a non-stick cookware by the chemical company [[DuPont]], since 1951. Fortunately for consumers, it does not exist in significant amounts in the final product of Teflon that could cause noticeable harm upon normal use.<ref name=\":7\" /> However, DuPont and [[3M]] workers that handle PFOA, as well as people who live near the plants, are not as fortunate.\n\n====== Birth defects ======\nIn 1981, two babies of female workers have been found to have eye-related defects. In 1986, Buck Bailey was born with a single nostril, a serrated eye lid, and a [[Coloboma|keyhole pupil]], due to his mother being exposed to PFOA on a daily basis when she worked at DuPont.<ref name=\":9\" />\n\n====== Contamination of drinking water in Parkersburg, WV ======\nIt was not until the early 1990's that the toxic effects of PFOA became a public concern. Wilbur Tennant, a farmer who lives on his own private land near the DuPont plant in [[Parkersburg, West Virginia]], videotaped the calamitous effects of PFOA on his cattle and local wildlife. Calves were born with black teeth and opaque eyes. Several cows and deer were found dead by the stream.<ref name=\":8\" /><ref name=\":9\" /> As it turned out, DuPont was dumping large amounts of waste PFOA into local streams that fed into Parkersburg's town water supply. So much waste PFOA was dumped that DuPont quickly lost count. Eventually, children were noticed to have black teeth, much like the calves in Tennant's farm.<ref name=\":9\" />\n\n====== Phasing out C8 ======\nIn 2003, 3M phased out C8 for C4 in attempt to avoid public backlash. They urged DuPont to do the same. Instead, DuPont seized the opportunity to become the sole manufacturer of C8 and increased production.<ref name=\":8\" /><ref name=\":9\" /> This lasted until the EPA banned the production of C8 in 2013. DuPont soon substituted C8 with Gen-X, which is a chemical that has not yet been researched or regulated.<ref name=\":8\" /> In order to detach their name from the toxic reputation of PFOA's, DuPont created the spin-off company, Chemours, to handle production and continued dumping of Gen-X.<ref name=\":9\" />\n\nAfter facing several [[Class action|class-action]] lawsuits, DuPont paid $43,000 residents of Ohio each $400 to participate in a study to determine whether C8 could be linked to any diseases. Participation in the study also required each person to waive their rights to sue DuPont if no links could be made. The study lasted over seven years and grew to almost 70,000 participants, including West Virginia residents. The results were concluded in 2012. Six diseases were linked: \u201c[[Testicular cancer|testicular]] and [[kidney cancer]], [[ulcerative colitis]], [[thyroid disease]], [[pre-eclampsia]], and [[Hypercholesterolemia|high cholesterol]].\u201d<ref name=\":9\" />\n\n===== DuPont's public relations with Parkersburg, WV =====\nPart of the reason it has been difficult for residents of Parkersburg, West Virginia to challenge DuPont is because the chemical company makes large contributions to the local economy, education system, and local government. There are even buildings and a street named after DuPont.<ref name=\":9\" />\n\n===== Environmental regulation =====\nPFOA is a group of chemicals that are still being studied.

It can be found virtually everywhere, including the soil, water, rocks, and flora. As radium is naturally everywhere in the environment, all humans are almost always exposed to radium.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=https://semspub.epa.gov/work/HQ/176334.pdf|title=EPA Facts about Radium|last=|first=|date=|website=EPA|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=21 February 2020}}</ref> At natural levels, radium is quite benign. However, at excessive levels, radium poisoning can occur. When the body takes in radium, it perceives it as calcium. Consequently, the body fills bones with radium, which can lead to brittle bones, collapsed spines, and teeth to fall out.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.atomicheritage.org/history/radium-girls|title=Radium Girls|last=|first=|date=|website=Atomic Heritage|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=21 February 2020}}</ref>\n\nRadium was discovered in 1898 by [[Marie Curie|Marie]] and [[Pierre Curie]].<ref name=\":2\" /> In the early 1900\u2019s it was used as radiation treatment for cancer. Expansion of radium\u2019s use in medical practices was earnestly attempted in the treatment of [[rheumatism]] and mental disorders.<ref name=\":1\" /> However, these pursuits were unsuccessful.\n\n===== Radium Girls =====\nDue to radium\u2019s [[Luminescence|luminescent]] properties, American inventor [[William Joseph Hammer|William J. Hammer]] mixed radium with glue and zinc sulfide to make glow-in-the-dark paint.<ref name=\":2\" /> This paint was used by the U.S. Radium Corporation and named \u201c[[Undark]].\u201d<ref name=\":2\" /> The paint was primarily used for wristwatch dials. Further application of the paint reached military equipment after the company accepted a contract with the U.S. government during WWI.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nStarting in 1916, the U.S. Radium Corporation established factories in New Jersey that recruited dozens of women to paint the watch dials with Undark.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cnn.com/style/article/radium-girls-radioactive-paint/index.html|title=Radium Girls: The dark times of luminous watches|last=CNN|first=Jacopo Prisco|website=CNN|language=en|access-date=2020-04-05}}</ref> No [[Personal protective equipment|safety equipment]] were given to the women, nor were any precautions taken.<ref name=\":2\" /> The women were instructed to frequently lick the paint brushes, in order to keep them wet and shaped to a fine point. Throughout every day, the women\u2019s clothes and skin were covered in radium paint. This lead to the women developing fatal radium poisoning.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nBy the mid-1920\u2019s dozens upon dozens of these women were falling ill and dying from prolonged, horrific deaths. The radium they ingested was dissolving their bones from the inside, causing severe pain and enormous deformities with pieces of their bodies easily breaking and falling off. By 1927, over 50 women died from radium poisoning.<ref name=\":5\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/2014/12/28/373510029/saved-by-a-bad-taste-one-of-the-last-radium-girls-dies-at-107|title=Mae Keane, One Of The Last 'Radium Girls,' Dies At 107|website=NPR.org|language=en|access-date=2020-04-05}}</ref>\n\nA smaller number of these female workers tried suing the company, not only for financial compensation to pay for their large medical bills and to afford themselves income to be able to live out the rest of their lives, but also to expose the company to their wrongful doing.<ref name=\":5\" /> Dial painter, Grace Fryer, as well as four other women sued U.S. Radium for $250,000. However, this lawsuit was unsuccessful because of U.S. Radium\u2019s vast team of lawyers and contractual affiliation with the U.S. government. The women were so desperate to afford medical treatment and food, that they had to settle for $10,000 each and a $600 annual payment. Unfortunately, all five women passed away within two years after the settlement.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nThe fate of the [[Radium Girls]] raised a lot of national concern for workers\u2019 health rights and conditions. After the incident, precautions and safety equipment were mandated to protect workers handling radioactive material in several occupations. The [[Manhattan Project]] notably used fume hoods, personal protective equipment, sanitation, and frequent checks for contamination, in order to prevent a repeat of the Radium Girls tragedy. In 1949, the U.S. Congress passed a law that compensates workers for occupational illnesses.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n===== Environmental regulation =====\nBy the time World War II began, safety limits for handling radiation had been set by the federal government.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\nIn 1934, the [[International Commission on Radiological Protection]] (ICRP) established a tolerance dose for workers of 0.2 [[Roentgen (unit)|roentgens]] of radiation exposure to workers per day.\u00a0In 1936, the National Committee on Radiation Protection and Measurements (NCRP) reduced the limit to 0.1 roentgens per day which held through World War II.\u00a0From 1936 through 1977 there were continual revisions by professional scientists and the government agencies as to what constituted safe doses. By the end of World War II, arguments between the U.S. military leaders and civilian officials ensued as to what were considered best practices to controlling nuclear energy and repressing fabrication of nuclear weapons by other nations. This led to the dispute in going to congress and resulting in congress passing the [[Atomic Energy Act of 1946|Atomic Energy Act]] (AEA) of 1946.<ref name=\":6\">{{Cite book|last=Commission|first=Institute of Medicine (US) Committee for Review and Evaluation of the Medical Use Program of the Nuclear Regulatory|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK232703/|title=History of Radiation Regulation in Medicine|last2=Gottfried|first2=Kate-Louise D.|last3=Penn|first3=Gary|date=1996|publisher=National Academies Press (US)|language=en}}</ref>\n\nThe EPA was created in 1970 to accept certain functions and responsibilities from other federal agencies and departments. Since its inception, the EPA has run environmental programs that address radioactive waste disposal sites, off-site monitoring around nuclear power plants, and keeps an eye on natural sources of radioactivity, such as radon.<ref name=\":6\" />\n\nThe EPA has developed guidance on topics such as occupational radiation limits and exposures for federal agencies and members of the public. The EPA can offer recommendations on quality assurance programs for nuclear medicine under its FRC-derived authority.<ref name=\":6\" />\n\n==== Perfluorooctanoic Acid (PFOA) ====\n[[Perfluorooctanoic acid]], a.k.a. PFOA or C8, is a synthetic chemical [[surfactant]] that is often used in the process of making non-stick cookware. PFOA is extremely bio-persistent, with a [[half-life]] of 8 years in humans.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.epa.gov/sites/production/files/2016-01/documents/pfcs_action_plan1230_09.pdf|title=Long-Chain Perfluorinated Chemicals (PFCs)Action Plan|last=|first=|date=2009-12-30|website=EPA|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-04-04}}</ref> PFOA can stay in the environment and the human body over long periods of time, and can have harmful effects to people exposed in high doses.<ref name=\":7\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.cancer.org/cancer/cancer-causes/teflon-and-perfluorooctanoic-acid-pfoa.html|title=Perfluorooctanoic Acid (PFOA), Teflon, and Related Chemicals|website=www.cancer.org|language=en|access-date=2020-03-14}}</ref>\n\n===== Clean blood sudy =====\nA worldwide study was conducted to compare \u201cclean blood,\u201d i.e., blood without C8 as a control with blood that contains C8, in order to illuminate the hazardous effects on humans. However, \u201cclean blood,\u201d could not be found from participants because 99% across the globe had derivatives of C8 found in their blood. Instead, samples of preserved blood from American Soldiers during the Korean War were used as the control. The blood was obtained in 1950, a year before Teflon was ever sold to the public. None of the preserved blood was found to contain C8, strongly suggesting that the worldwide use of Teflon caused a nigh-ubiquitous absence of \u201cclean blood.\u201d<ref name=\":8\">{{Cite web|url=http://connect2conserve.org/teflon-and-forever-chemicals/|title=Teflon and Forever Chemicals \u2013 Connect 2 Conserve|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-05}}</ref><ref name=\":9\">{{Cite AV media|url=https://thedevilweknow.com/|title=The Devil We Know|date=2018-01-21|last=Soechtig|first=Stephanie|type=Documentary|language=}}</ref>\n\n===== DuPont and 3M =====\nPFOA has been used to make [[Polytetrafluoroethylene|Teflon]], a non-stick cookware by the chemical company [[DuPont]], since 1951. Fortunately for consumers, it does not exist in significant amounts in the final product of Teflon that could cause noticeable harm upon normal use.<ref name=\":7\" /> However, DuPont and [[3M]] workers that handle PFOA, as well as people who live near the plants, are not as fortunate.\n\n====== Birth defects ======\nIn 1981, two babies of female workers have been found to have eye-related defects. In 1986, Buck Bailey was born with a single nostril, a serrated eye lid, and a [[Coloboma|keyhole pupil]], due to his mother being exposed to PFOA on a daily basis when she worked at DuPont.<ref name=\":9\" />\n\n====== Contamination of drinking water in Parkersburg, WV ======\nIt was not until the early 1990's that the toxic effects of PFOA became a public concern. Wilbur Tennant, a farmer who lives on his own private land near the DuPont plant in [[Parkersburg, West Virginia]], videotaped the calamitous effects of PFOA on his cattle and local wildlife. Calves were born with black teeth and opaque eyes. Several cows and deer were found dead by the stream.<ref name=\":8\" /><ref name=\":9\" /> As it turned out, DuPont was dumping large amounts of waste PFOA into local streams that fed into Parkersburg's town water supply. So much waste PFOA was dumped that DuPont quickly lost count. Eventually, children were noticed to have black teeth, much like the calves in Tennant's farm.<ref name=\":9\" />\n\n====== Phasing out C8 ======\nIn 2003, 3M phased out C8 for C4 in attempt to avoid public backlash. They urged DuPont to do the same. Instead, DuPont seized the opportunity to become the sole manufacturer of C8 and increased production.<ref name=\":8\" /><ref name=\":9\" /> This lasted until the EPA banned the production of C8 in 2013. DuPont soon substituted C8 with Gen-X, which is a chemical that has not yet been researched or regulated.<ref name=\":8\" /> In order to detach their name from the toxic reputation of PFOA's, DuPont created the spin-off company, Chemours, to handle production and continued dumping of Gen-X.<ref name=\":9\" />\n\nAfter facing several [[Class action|class-action]] lawsuits, DuPont paid $43,000 residents of Ohio each $400 to participate in a study to determine whether C8 could be linked to any diseases. Participation in the study also required each person to waive their rights to sue DuPont if no links could be made. The study lasted over seven years and grew to almost 70,000 participants, including West Virginia residents. The results were concluded in 2012. Six diseases were linked: \u201c[[Testicular cancer|testicular]] and [[kidney cancer]], [[ulcerative colitis]], [[thyroid disease]], [[pre-eclampsia]], and [[Hypercholesterolemia|high cholesterol]].\u201d<ref name=\":9\" />\n\n===== DuPont's public relations with Parkersburg, WV =====\nPart of the reason it has been difficult for residents of Parkersburg, West Virginia to challenge DuPont is because the chemical company makes large contributions to the local economy, education system, and local government. There are even buildings and a street named after DuPont.<ref name=\":9\" />\n\n===== Environmental regulation =====\nPFOA is a group of chemicals that are still being studied. To date EPA has not yet established statutory clean-up levels for PFOA.\u00a0However,\u00a0the agency has established health advisory levels for these substances based on EPA\u2019s assessment of the latest\u00a0peer-reviewed science.\u00a0This advisory is meant to provide states, tribal and local officials, and drinking water system operators,\u00a0information on the health risks due to these chemicals in order to enable these people to take appropriate measures to protect their communities.\u00a0EPA has established a health advisory number of 70 parts per trillion for PFOS in drinking water to provide a conservative margin of protection to the most sensitive populations, thus ensuring protection for everyone.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.epa.gov/ground-water-and-drinking-water/drinking-water-health-advisories-pfoa-and-pfos|title=Drinking Water Health Advisories for PFOA and PFOS|last=US EPA|first=OW|date=2016-05-05|website=US EPA|language=en|access-date=2020-04-05}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n<references />\n\n\n\n[[Category:Regulation of chemicals]]\n", "name_user": "John B123", "label": "safe", "comment": "Fixed cite & CS1 errors", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaps_in_Regulation_of_Chemical_Agents"}
