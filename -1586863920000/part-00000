Notable additional characters include [[quotation mark|curly quotation marks]] and all the printable characters that are in [[ISO/IEC 8859-15|ISO&nbsp;8859-15]] (at different places than ISO&nbsp;8859-15). It is known to Windows by the [[Windows code page|code page]] number 1252, and by the [[Internet Assigned Numbers Authority|IANA]]-approved name \"windows-1252\".\n\n<!-- I think the following text is right but I need to do some checking first before I uncomment it (not quite true, yes it happened, but Netscape, Mosaic, et al. were at fault as well :)\nAt one stage many MS internet products produced text in Windows-1252 but marked as ISO-8859-1. This has resulted in other internet applications treating ISO-8859-1 as meaning Windows-1252 to maintain compatibility with Microsoft products.\nFollowing text is copied (mostly) from ISO-8859-1 page.\n-->It is very common to mislabel Windows-1252 text with the charset label ISO-8859-1. A common result was that all the quotes and apostrophes (produced by \"smart quotes\" in word-processing software) were replaced with question marks or boxes on non-Windows operating systems, making text difficult to read. Most modern web browsers and e-mail clients treat the [[media type]] charset ISO-8859-1 as Windows-1252 to accommodate such mislabeling. This is now standard behavior in the [[HTML5 in mobile devices|HTML5]] specification, which requires that documents advertised as ISO-8859-1 actually be parsed with the Windows-1252 encoding.<ref name=\"WHATWG\">{{cite web |url=https://encoding.spec.whatwg.org/#names-and-labels |title=Encoding |at=sec. 5.2 Names and labels |publisher=[[WHATWG]] |date=27 January 2015 |accessdate=4 February 2015 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150204174315/https://encoding.spec.whatwg.org/#names-and-labels |archivedate=4 February 2015 |url-status=live}}</ref><!-- No authors listed on page, but GitHub lists contributors as -->\n\nHistorically, the phrase \"ANSI Code Page\" was used in Windows to refer to non-DOS encodings; the intention was that most of these would be [[ANSI]] standards such as [[ISO-8859-1]].

Notable additional characters include [[quotation mark|curly quotation marks]] and all the printable characters that are in [[ISO/IEC 8859-15|ISO&nbsp;8859-15]] (at different places than ISO&nbsp;8859-15).

This has resulted in other internet applications treating ISO-8859-1 as meaning Windows-1252 to maintain compatibility with Microsoft products.\nFollowing text is copied (mostly) from ISO-8859-1 page.\n-->It is very common to mislabel Windows-1252 text with the charset label ISO-8859-1. A common result was that all the quotes and apostrophes (produced by \"smart quotes\" in word-processing software) were replaced with question marks or boxes on non-Windows operating systems, making text difficult to read. Most modern web browsers and e-mail clients treat the [[media type]] charset ISO-8859-1 as Windows-1252 to accommodate such mislabeling.

The British, at the end of the 19th century, reorganized the CHT. This resulted in the recognition of three tribal chiefs (rajas) in 1860, (b) enactment of the Chittagong Hill Tracts Frontier Police Regulations in 1881, authorizing a police force from among the hill peoples, and (c) enactment of the Chittagong Hill Tracts Regulations in 1900, giving them rights and autonomy. When [[Bangladesh]] was the [[East Pakistan|eastern wing]] of [[Pakistan]], widespread resentment occurred over the displacement of as many as 100,000 of the native peoples due to the construction of the [[Kaptai Dam]] in 1962. The displaced did not receive compensation from the government and many thousands fled to [[India]]. After the [[Bangladesh Liberation War|creation of Bangladesh]] in 1971, representatives of the Chittagong Hill Tracts who was the [[Chakma people|Chakma]] politician [[Manabendra Narayan Larma]] sought autonomy and recognition of the rights of the peoples of the region. Larma and other Hill Tracts representatives protested the draft of the [[Constitution of Bangladesh]].

Most common form of killing occurs when indigenous people are detained and beaten in numerous Bangladeshi military, intelligence and police installations in CHT. Killings also occur when Bangladeshi armed forces randomly open fire at villagers. Bangladesh government provides weapons to settlers and they are also responsible for killing of indigenous people. The settlers often join the armed forces in raid of indigenous villages and involved in killing indigenous people by firearms or crude sharp weapons. The settlers also take part in communal riots instigated by the Bangladeshi armed forces and kill indigenous people.<ref>{{cite book |title=Bangladesh Unlawful Killings And Torture In The Chittagong Hill Tracts |date=1986 |publisher=Amnesty International |location=United Kingdom |isbn=0862101107 |pages=10-11}}</ref>\n\n===Rapes===\n\nBetween 1981 and 1994 it is estimated that 2,500 Jumma women had been raped by Bangladesh armed forces and in 1995 it was estimated that of over 94% of rapes between 1991 and 1993 had been by the Bangladesh armed forces, with allegations that 80% of those raped were Jumma. According to Kabita Chakma and Glen Hill, the sexual abuse against Jumma women is endemic.<ref name=\"Chakma 2013 p144\" /> During the conflict, the security forces had used a deliberate strategy of rape, torture, arbitrary arrests, mass imprisonment and kidnapping against the Jumma.<ref name=\"Begovich 2007 p169\" />\n\nBangladesh government tacitly encourages armed forces  and settlers to rape indigenous girls and women as a tool to expel them from their traditional land. As a result thousands of indigenous girls and women were raped by armed forces and settlers since independence of Bangladesh in 1971.\n\nBangladeshi armed forces in league with the settlers raid indigenous villages, separate men from women and rape indigenous girls and women. Bangladeshi armed forces and settlers often rape indigenous girls and women in front of their husbands and parents. Bangladeshi armed forces and settlers also target indigenous girls and women when they go to markets, schools or go to fetch water or fire wood.\n\n===Detention and Torture===\n\nIndigenous people are detained without warrant and often tortured in the custody of Bangladeshi armed forces. Bangladeshi armed forces detain and torture indigenous people on mere suspicion of being members of the [[Shanti Bahini]] or helping the [[Shanti Bahini]]. There were numerous check posts on highways and ferries in [[Chittagong Hill Tracts]]. <ref>{{cite book |title=Bangladesh Unlawful Killings And Torture In The Chittagong Hill Tracts |date=1986 |publisher=Amnesty International |location=United Kingdom |isbn=0862101107 |pages=26-30}}</ref>\n\nBangladeshi armed forces interrogate and detain indigenous travellers from this check posts. Bangladeshi armed forces raid indigenous villages and torture indigenous people on suspicion of sheltering and feeding the [[Shanti Bahini]].\n\nIndigenous people who are detained in military camps and cantonments are subjected to severe beating, electrocution, water boarding, hanging upside down, shoving burning cigarettes on bodies etc. Prisoners are detained in pits and trenches. Bangladeshi soldiers sprinkle hot water on indigenous prisoners. Indigenous captives are then taken out for interrogation one at a time. Indigenous people are often tortured during interrogation.\n\n===Religious Persecution===\n\nBangladeshi armed forces and settlers often target Buddhist and Hindu temples when they raid indigenous villages. Destruction and desecration of Buddhist and Hindu temples are common occurrences in CHT. Bangladeshi armed forces and settlers often slaughter cows and goats in Buddhist and Hindu temples to desecrate the place of worship.<ref>{{cite book |title=Life is Not Ours: Land and Human Rights in the Chittagong Hill Tracts |date=1991 |publisher=The Chittagong Hill Tracts Commission |location=Netherlands |pages=87-100}}</ref>\n\nBangladeshi armed forces and settlers often humiliate and beat Buddhist monks and Hindu priests in front of the indigenous people to demean their faiths. Bangladeshi armed forces man handle Buddhist monks and Hindu priests at various check posts in CHT.\n\nBangladeshi armed forces and settlers often forcibly convert indigenous people to Islam as a way to escape from never ending persecution. The settlers abduct indigenous women and forcibly convert them to Islam for marrying.\n\n===Land Grab===\n\nSince vast majority of the indigenous people are farmers and cultivators, land is very important and only means of survival. The government's sponsored settlement in CHT dispossessed many indigenous people of their lands.<ref>{{cite book |title=The Chittagong Hill Tracts Militarization, Oppression and the Hill Tribes |date=1984 |publisher=Anti Slavery Society |location=United Kingdom |isbn=0900918195 |page=43}}</ref>\n\nOften Bangladeshi armed forces expel indigenous people from their villages by massacres, arsons and constant harassments. Bangladeshi armed forces then give emptied villages to the settlers. In many cases Bangladeshi armed forces built settlements near indigenous villages. The settlers then gradually encroach on the lands of indigenous people.\n\nAnother way to grab indigenous land is to build military camp on indigenous land with little or no compensation and then constantly harass the indigenous people by intimidation, extortion, interrogation, rape which forces indigenous people to leave the villages.\n\n===Recent Developments===\n\nThe accords of the peace treaty have yet to be fully implemented which has resulted in the region remaining heavily militarised and mass inward migration continuing. Human rights violations continue with arbitrary arrests, killing and rapes occurring and human rights activists are targeted for questioning and arrests.<ref name=\"Wessendorf 2009 pp12-23\" /> According to a report from the Asian Centre for Human Rights on 26 August 2003 the UPDF in conjunction with tribals planned and launched an attack on ten villages. Hundreds of people were displaced and it is estimated that ten women, some who were Jumma were raped. It was reported that a nine-month-old child was strangled after it was grabbed from its grandmother who the settlers raped.<ref name=\"Chakma 2003 p4\" />\n\nAs yet the Jumma peoples have not been given constitutional recognition and are referred to as \"backward segments of the population\"<ref name=\"Wessendorf 2011 p328\" />\n\n==Government reaction==\n[[File:Chittagong Hill Tracts locator map.svg|thumb|200px|right|A map of the Chittagong Hill Tracts.]]\nAt the outbreak of the insurgency, the Government of Bangladesh deployed the army to begin counter-insurgency operations. The then-[[President of Bangladesh]] [[Ziaur Rahman]] created a [[Chittagong Hill Tracts Development Board]] under an army general to address the socio-economic needs of the region, but the entity proved unpopular and became a source of antagonism and mistrust amongst the native people against the government.

The British, at the end of the 19th century, reorganized the CHT. This resulted in the recognition of three tribal chiefs (rajas) in 1860, (b) enactment of the Chittagong Hill Tracts Frontier Police Regulations in 1881, authorizing a police force from among the hill peoples, and (c) enactment of the Chittagong Hill Tracts Regulations in 1900, giving them rights and autonomy. When [[Bangladesh]] was the [[East Pakistan|eastern wing]] of [[Pakistan]], widespread resentment occurred over the displacement of as many as 100,000 of the native peoples due to the construction of the [[Kaptai Dam]] in 1962. The displaced did not receive compensation from the government and many thousands fled to [[India]]. After the [[Bangladesh Liberation War|creation of Bangladesh]] in 1971, representatives of the Chittagong Hill Tracts who was the [[Chakma people|Chakma]] politician [[Manabendra Narayan Larma]] sought autonomy and recognition of the rights of the peoples of the region. Larma and other Hill Tracts representatives protested the draft of the [[Constitution of Bangladesh]]. It did not recognise the ethnic identity and culture of the non-[[Bengali people|Bengali]] peoples of Bangladesh. The government policy recognised only the [[Culture of Bengal|Bengali culture]] and the [[Bengali language]], and designated all citizens of Bangladesh as Bengalis. In talks with a Chittagong Hill Tracts delegation led by Manabendra Narayan Larma, the country's founding leader [[Sheikh Mujibur Rahman]] expressed that the ethnic groups of the Hill Tracts as citizen of Bangladesh should have the Bengali identity.<ref name=\"F\">{{cite book |author=Nagendra K.

Most common form of killing occurs when indigenous people are detained and beaten in numerous Bangladeshi military, intelligence and police installations in CHT. Killings also occur when Bangladeshi armed forces randomly open fire at villagers. Bangladesh government provides weapons to settlers and they are also responsible for killing of indigenous people. The settlers often join the armed forces in raid of indigenous villages and involved in killing indigenous people by firearms or crude sharp weapons. The settlers also take part in communal riots instigated by the Bangladeshi armed forces and kill indigenous people.<ref>{{cite book |title=Bangladesh Unlawful Killings And Torture In The Chittagong Hill Tracts |date=1986 |publisher=Amnesty International |location=United Kingdom |isbn=0862101107 |pages=10-11}}</ref>\n\n===Rapes===\n\nBetween 1981 and 1994 it is estimated that 2,500 Jumma women had been raped by Bangladesh armed forces and in 1995 it was estimated that of over 94% of rapes between 1991 and 1993 had been by the Bangladesh armed forces, with allegations that 80% of those raped were Jumma. According to Kabita Chakma and Glen Hill, the sexual abuse against Jumma women is endemic.<ref name=\"Chakma 2013 p144\" /> During the conflict, the security forces had used a deliberate strategy of rape, torture, arbitrary arrests, mass imprisonment and kidnapping against the Jumma.<ref name=\"Begovich 2007 p169\" />\n\nBangladesh government tacitly encourages armed forces  and settlers to rape indigenous girls and women as a tool to expel them from their traditional land. As a result thousands of indigenous girls and women were raped by armed forces and settlers since independence of Bangladesh in 1971.\n\nBangladeshi armed forces in league with the settlers raid indigenous villages, separate men from women and rape indigenous girls and women. Bangladeshi armed forces and settlers often rape indigenous girls and women in front of their husbands and parents. Bangladeshi armed forces and settlers also target indigenous girls and women when they go to markets, schools or go to fetch water or fire wood.\n\n===Detention and Torture===\n\nIndigenous people are detained without warrant and often tortured in the custody of Bangladeshi armed forces. Bangladeshi armed forces detain and torture indigenous people on mere suspicion of being members of the [[Shanti Bahini]] or helping the [[Shanti Bahini]]. There were numerous check posts on highways and ferries in [[Chittagong Hill Tracts]]. <ref>{{cite book |title=Bangladesh Unlawful Killings And Torture In The Chittagong Hill Tracts |date=1986 |publisher=Amnesty International |location=United Kingdom |isbn=0862101107 |pages=26-30}}</ref>\n\nBangladeshi armed forces interrogate and detain indigenous travellers from this check posts. Bangladeshi armed forces raid indigenous villages and torture indigenous people on suspicion of sheltering and feeding the [[Shanti Bahini]].\n\nIndigenous people who are detained in military camps and cantonments are subjected to severe beating, electrocution, water boarding, hanging upside down, shoving burning cigarettes on bodies etc. Prisoners are detained in pits and trenches. Bangladeshi soldiers sprinkle hot water on indigenous prisoners. Indigenous captives are then taken out for interrogation one at a time. Indigenous people are often tortured during interrogation.\n\n===Religious Persecution===\n\nBangladeshi armed forces and settlers often target Buddhist and Hindu temples when they raid indigenous villages. Destruction and desecration of Buddhist and Hindu temples are common occurrences in CHT. Bangladeshi armed forces and settlers often slaughter cows and goats in Buddhist and Hindu temples to desecrate the place of worship.<ref>{{cite book |title=Life is Not Ours: Land and Human Rights in the Chittagong Hill Tracts |date=1991 |publisher=The Chittagong Hill Tracts Commission |location=Netherlands |pages=87-100}}</ref>\n\nBangladeshi armed forces and settlers often humiliate and beat Buddhist monks and Hindu priests in front of the indigenous people to demean their faiths. Bangladeshi armed forces man handle Buddhist monks and Hindu priests at various check posts in CHT.\n\nBangladeshi armed forces and settlers often forcibly convert indigenous people to Islam as a way to escape from never ending persecution. The settlers abduct indigenous women and forcibly convert them to Islam for marrying.\n\n===Land Grab===\n\nSince vast majority of the indigenous people are farmers and cultivators, land is very important and only means of survival. The government's sponsored settlement in CHT dispossessed many indigenous people of their lands.<ref>{{cite book |title=The Chittagong Hill Tracts Militarization, Oppression and the Hill Tribes |date=1984 |publisher=Anti Slavery Society |location=United Kingdom |isbn=0900918195 |page=43}}</ref>\n\nOften Bangladeshi armed forces expel indigenous people from their villages by massacres, arsons and constant harassments. Bangladeshi armed forces then give emptied villages to the settlers. In many cases Bangladeshi armed forces built settlements near indigenous villages. The settlers then gradually encroach on the lands of indigenous people.\n\nAnother way to grab indigenous land is to build military camp on indigenous land with little or no compensation and then constantly harass the indigenous people by intimidation, extortion, interrogation, rape which forces indigenous people to leave the villages.\n\n===Recent Developments===\n\nThe accords of the peace treaty have yet to be fully implemented which has resulted in the region remaining heavily militarised and mass inward migration continuing. Human rights violations continue with arbitrary arrests, killing and rapes occurring and human rights activists are targeted for questioning and arrests.<ref name=\"Wessendorf 2009 pp12-23\" /> According to a report from the Asian Centre for Human Rights on 26 August 2003 the UPDF in conjunction with tribals planned and launched an attack on ten villages. Hundreds of people were displaced and it is estimated that ten women, some who were Jumma were raped. It was reported that a nine-month-old child was strangled after it was grabbed from its grandmother who the settlers raped.<ref name=\"Chakma 2003 p4\" />\n\nAs yet the Jumma peoples have not been given constitutional recognition and are referred to as \"backward segments of the population\"<ref name=\"Wessendorf 2011 p328\" />\n\n==Government reaction==\n[[File:Chittagong Hill Tracts locator map.svg|thumb|200px|right|A map of the Chittagong Hill Tracts.]]\nAt the outbreak of the insurgency, the Government of Bangladesh deployed the army to begin counter-insurgency operations. The then-[[President of Bangladesh]] [[Ziaur Rahman]] created a [[Chittagong Hill Tracts Development Board]] under an army general to address the socio-economic needs of the region, but the entity proved unpopular and became a source of antagonism and mistrust amongst the native people against the government. The government failed to address the long-standing issue of the displacement of people, numbering an estimated 100,000 caused by the construction of the [[Kaptai Dam]] in 1962.<ref name=\"internal\">{{cite web\n|url=http://www.internal-displacement.org/idmc/website/countries.nsf/(httpEnvelopes)/C2EA848CB001371D802570B8005A719E?OpenDocument\n|title=The construction of the Kaptai dam uproots the indigenous population (1957\u20131963)\n|accessdate=1 February 2007\n|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120204190113/http://www.internal-displacement.org/idmc/website/countries.nsf/(httpEnvelopes)/C2EA848CB001371D802570B8005A719E?OpenDocument\n|archive-date=4 February 2012\n|url-status=dead\n}}</ref> Displaced peoples did not receive compensation and more than 40,000 Chakma tribals had fled to India.<ref name=\"internal\"/> In the 1980s, the government began settling Bengalis in the region, causing the eviction of many natives and a significant alteration of demographics.
