The first reported spinosaurid from Asia, it is confidently known only from tooth [[Fossil|fossils]], the first of which were found in the [[Sao Khua Formation]], with more teeth later recovered from the younger [[Khok Kruat Formation]]. The [[type species]] '''''Siamosaurus suteethorni''''', whose name honours Thai [[palaeontologist]] [[Varavudh Suteethorn]], was formally described in [[1986 in paleontology|1986]]. One possible ''Siamosaurus'' tooth was discovered in the Japanese [[Sebayashi Formation]] in 1994, and a tooth similar to it was found at the same site in 2015. In 2009, four teeth from China's [[Xinlong Formation]] formerly thought to belong to a [[Pliosauroidea|pliosaur]] (under the species name '''\"''Sinopliosaurus''\" ''fusuiensis''''') were identified as those of a spinosaurid. \"''S''.\" ''fusuiensis'' may be the same animal as ''Siamosaurus''. Two partial spinosaurid skeletons have been found in Thailand, one in the Sao Khua and the other in the Khok Kruat Formation, but whether they belong to ''Siamosaurus'' or not is unclear.\n\nThe [[holotype]] tooth is {{Convert|62.5|mm|}} long and {{Convert|16.6 by 12.5|mm|}} wide at its base. Since it is a tooth [[taxon]], ''Siamosaurus''{{'}}s body size and weight are uncertain, though it has been estimated at between {{Convert|5.1 to 9.1|m||abbr=}} and weighing {{Convert|1|tonne|short ton}}. ''Siamosaurus''<nowiki/>'s teeth were straight, oval to circular in cross section, and lined with distinct lengthwise grooves. The tooth's [[Tooth enamel|enamel]] was wrinkled, similar to that of teeth from the related genus ''[[Baryonyx]]''. ''Siamosaurus''{{'}}s identity has been questioned by many palaeontologists, who argue that its teeth are too similar to those of contemporaneous aquatic reptiles for it to be confidently classed as a dinosaur. Other researchers, who agree that the teeth are spinosaur in origin, deem them too similar to those of other Early Cretaceous spinosaurs to  raise a new genus unequivocally. Based on characteristics of their teeth, ''Siamosaurus'' and \"''Sinopliosaurus''\" ''fusuiensis'' have been placed in the [[Spinosaurinae]] [[subfamily]].\n\nLike in all spinosaurids, ''Siamosaurus''{{'}}s teeth were conical, with reduced or absent [[Serration|serrations]]. This made them suitable for impaling rather than tearing flesh, a trait typically seen in largely [[piscivorous]] (fish-eating) animals. In addition, its relatives are known to have consumed [[Pterosaur|pterosaurs]] and small to medium-sized dinosaurs, and there is fossil evidence of ''Siamosaurus'' itself eating [[Sauropoda|sauropod]] dinosaurs, either via scavenging or active hunting. ''Siamosaurus'' lived in a [[Semi-arid climate|semi-arid]] habitat of [[Floodplain|floodplains]] and meandering rivers, where it coexisted with other theropod, sauropod, and (in at least the Khok Kruat Formation) [[Iguanodontia|iguanodontian]] dinosaurs. [[Isotope analysis]] of spinosaurid teeth indicates they may have had [[semiaquatic]] habits, and ''Siamosaurus''{{'}}s role as a largely piscivorous predator might have reduced the prominence of contemporaneous [[Crocodilia|crocodilians]] competing for the same food source.\n\n== History of discovery ==\n[[File:Cretaceous_strata_in_northeast_and_southeastern_Thailand.png|thumb|left|Geological map of the [[Khorat Plateau]] in northeast Thailand]]\n\nThe [[Sao Khua Formation]], where the first ''Siamosaurus'' [[Fossil|fossils]] were discovered, is part of the [[Khorat Group]].<ref name=\":0\">Buffetaut, E.; and Ingevat, R.

According to the authors, this dramatic size range suggests the teeth are from individuals of different ages. The holotype tooth is relatively straight, with only minor front to back curvature. It is oval in cross section while other specimens are nearly circular in this aspect. Unlike in most theropods, the [[Glossary of dinosaur anatomy#carinae|carinae]] (cutting edges) of ''Siamosaurus''{{'}}s teeth lack well-defined serrations.

It is unknown on which jaw the tooth was positioned nor which surface faced the inside or outside of the mouth. The tooth's front and back carinae are well-defined, though the former is not well preserved. Besides having a broader, {{Convert|20 by 14|mm||adj=on|abbr=on}} wide base and being slightly smaller at {{Convert|51|mm||abbr=on}} in length, GMNH-PV-999 has a very similar morphology to the ''Siamosaurus suteethorni'' holotype. Features shared between the two specimens include: a straight and only slightly compressed shape; a somewhat oval cross section; no serrations on the carinae (possibly due to bad preservation); and flutes on the crown surface, the Japan specimen having 12 on each side. The specimens also share a crown surface with numerous small granular structures oriented parallel to their lengths. Because of these resemblances, Hasegawa and colleagues regarded GMNH-PV-999 as nearly identical to the ''Siamosaurus suteethorni'' holotype tooth.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\nKDC-PV-0003, the second tooth found in the Sebayashi Formation, consists of a slightly recurved crown fragment with a preserved length of {{Convert|10|mm||abbr=on}}, the top and bottom of the tooth having broken off. At its base, the crown is {{Convert|7.4|mm||abbr=on}} long and {{Convert|6.8|mm||abbr=on}} wide, with an almost circular cross section. Though less complete than the former specimens, KDC-PV-0003 exhibits better preservation of small details such as visible serrations, although poorly defined ones. The denticles, of which there are two to three every {{Convert|1|mm||adj=on|abbr=on}}, are visible only on the front carinae, due to the rear of the tooth being obscured by rock [[Matrix (geology)|matrix]]. A {{Convert|5.5|mm||adj=on|abbr=on}} long gap at the fossil's base exposes the dentine, which is covered in a {{Convert|1.6|mm||adj=on|abbr=on}} thick layer of enamel. The little that is preserved of KDC-PV-0003 shows that like the first Sebayashi Formation tooth, it has a granular texture and a minimum of 12 flutes on its surface, not all of which stretch to the full length of the crown. The granular structures of KDC-PV-0003 are sharper than in GMNH-PV-999. The interdenticle sulci (tiny furrows near the gaps between each denticle) of KDC-PV-0003 have an [[Oblique angle|oblique]] orientation of 45 degrees, exactly like those seen in GMNH-PV-999.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\nOut of the four teeth referred to \"''Sinopliosaurus''\" ''fusuiensis'', specimen [[IVPP]] V 4793 is the most intact, although still somewhat deformed. The crown, which is missing its tip, is {{Convert|69|mm||abbr=on}} long and {{Convert|16.5 by 13|mm||abbr=on}} wide at the base. The tooth is straight, only slightly recurved, and has an oval cross section. The front and rear carinae are distinct, though their serrations have been heavily eroded, similar to those of KDC-PV-0003. Like the Thailand and Japan teeth, the \"''Sinopliosaurus''\" ''fusuiensis'' specimens bear developed flutes and a granular surface. As in both Sebayashi Formation teeth, there are 12 flutes on each face of \"''Sinopliosaurus''\" ''fusuiensis''{{'}}s teeth. Like in KDC-PV-0003, these flutes are of varied lengths. Buffetaut and colleagues likened the \"''Sinopliosaurus''\" ''fusuiensis'' teeth most to those of ''Siamosaurus'', given their identical crown shape, fluting, and granular enamel.<ref name=\"EBetal082\" />\n\n== Classification ==\n[[File:Spinosaurus_sp_Marocco_Cenom.JPG|thumb|Tooth of the related genus ''[[Spinosaurus]]'', Museo di Storia Naturale A. Stoppani, [[Lombardy]]]]\n\nIn 1986, Buffetaut and Ingavat classified ''Siamosaurus'' as a theropod because of the straight tall crown and double lateral recurvature of its teeth. At the time, ''Siamosaurus''{{'}}s particular combination of dental characteristics, especially the longitudinal fluting and lack of serrations, had not been observed in other theropods. The authors noted similarities in ''Siamosaurus''{{'}}s teeth to those of [[Ceratosauria|ceratosaurian]] tooth crowns, some of which also have longitudinal flutes. However, this identification was ruled out, since ceratosaur teeth differ in cross section, bear far fewer dental flutes, and have distinct serrations. Buffetaut and Suteethorn concluded that the closest taxon in [[Glossary of dinosaur anatomy#dentition|dentition]] to ''Siamosaurus'' was ''[[Spinosaurus]]''.

The study revealed that, among theropods, spinosaurid isotope ratios were closer to those of turtles and crocodilians. Thai spinosaurid teeth tended to have the largest difference from the ratios of other theropods, and those from Morocco tended to have the least difference. The authors concluded that spinosaurids, like modern crocodilians and hippopotamuses, were [[semiaquatic]] animals, and spent much of their daily lives in or near water. They also suggested that  piscivory and aquatic habits may explain how spinosaurids coexisted with other large theropods; by feeding on different prey items and occupying a distinct ecological role, a phenomenon known as [[niche partitioning]], the different types of theropods would have been out of direct competition.<ref name=\":21\" /><ref name=\"RMetal10\">{{cite journal |last=Amiot |first=R. |author2=Buffetaut, E. |author3=L\u00e9cuyer, C. |author4=Wang, X. |author5=Boudad, L. |author6=Ding, Z. |author7=Fourel, F. |author8=Hutt, S. |author9=Martineau, F. |author10=Medeiros, A. |author11=Mo, J. |author12=Simon, L. |author13=Suteethorn, V. |author14=Sweetman, S. |author15=Tong, H. |author16=Zhang, F. |author17=Zhou, Z. |year=2010 |title=Oxygen isotope evidence for semi-aquatic habits among spinosaurid theropods |journal=Geology |volume=38 |issue=2 |pages=139\u2013142 |doi=10.1130/G30402.1|bibcode=2010Geo....38..139A }}</ref>\n\n== Palaeoenvironment and palaeobiogeography ==\n[[File:Sao_Khua_Formation_V2.png|thumb|left|Restoration of ''Siamosaurus'' hunting fish in the Sao Khua Formation, with a herd of ''[[Phuwiangosaurus]]'' in the background]]\n\nThe sediments of the Sao Khua Formation, composed of [[Red clay|red clays]], [[Mudstone|mudstones]], [[Sandstone|sandstones]], [[Siltstone|siltstones]] and [[Conglomerate (geology)|conglomerate]] rocks, record a [[fluvial]] environment dominated by lakes, [[Floodplain|floodplains]], and meandering low-energy rivers.<ref name=\":12\" /><ref name=\":3\">{{Cite journal|last=Eric|first=Buffetaut|last2=Varavudh|first2=Suteethorn|date=1998|title=The biogeographical significance of the Mesozoic vertebrates from Thailand|url=http://doc.rero.ch/record/15441|journal=Biogeography and Geological Evolution of SE Asia|language=en}}</ref> This is consistent with the types of vertebrate fauna present in the formation, which comprise only terrestrial or freshwater animals, including dinosaurs, turtles, freshwater [[hybodont sharks]] and [[Actinopterygii|actinopterygian]] fishes, and the freshwater crocodilian ''[[Sunosuchus]]''.<ref name=\":1\" /> Besides ''Siamosaurus'', there were dinosaurs like the [[Metriacanthosauridae|metriacanthosaurid]] ''Siamotyrannus isanensis'',<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Carrano|first1=M.

The first reported spinosaurid from Asia, it is confidently known only from tooth [[Fossil|fossils]]; the first of which were found in the [[Sao Khua Formation]], with more teeth later recovered from the younger [[Khok Kruat Formation]]. The [[type species]] '''''Siamosaurus suteethorni''''', whose name honours Thai [[palaeontologist]] [[Varavudh Suteethorn]], was formally described in [[1986 in paleontology|1986]]. One possible ''Siamosaurus'' tooth was discovered in the Japanese [[Sebayashi Formation]] in 1994, and a tooth similar to it was found at the same site in 2015. In 2009, four teeth from China's [[Xinlong Formation]] formerly thought to belong to a [[Pliosauroidea|pliosaur]] (under the species name '''\"''Sinopliosaurus''\" ''fusuiensis''''') were identified as those of a spinosaurid. \"''S''.\" ''fusuiensis'' may be the same animal as ''Siamosaurus''. Two partial spinosaurid skeletons have been found in Thailand, one in the Sao Khua and the other in the Khok Kruat Formation, but whether they belong to ''Siamosaurus'' or not is unclear.\n\nThe [[holotype]] tooth is {{Convert|62.5|mm|}} long and {{Convert|16.6 by 12.5|mm|}} wide at its base. Since it is a tooth taxon, ''Siamosaurus''{{'}}s body size and weight are uncertain, though it has been estimated at between {{Convert|5.1 to 9.1|m||abbr=}} and weighing {{Convert|1|tonne|short ton}}. ''Siamosaurus''<nowiki/>'s teeth were straight, oval to circular in cross section, and lined with distinct lengthwise grooves. The tooth's [[Tooth enamel|enamel]] was wrinkled, similar to that of teeth from the related genus ''[[Baryonyx]]''. ''Siamosaurus''{{'}}s identity has been questioned by many palaeontologists, who argue that its teeth are too similar to those of contemporaneous aquatic reptiles for it to be confidently classed as a dinosaur. Other researchers, who agree that the teeth are spinosaur in origin, deem them too similar to those of other Early Cretaceous spinosaurs to unequivocally raise a new genus. Based on characteristics of their teeth, ''Siamosaurus'' and \"''Sinopliosaurus''\" ''fusuiensis'' have been placed in the [[Spinosaurinae]] [[subfamily]].\n\nLike in all spinosaurids, ''Siamosaurus''{{'}}s teeth were conical, with reduced or absent [[Serration|serrations]]. This made them suitable for impaling rather than tearing flesh, a trait typically seen in largely [[piscivorous]] (fish-eating) animals. Its relatives are known to have also consumed [[Pterosaur|pterosaurs]] and small to medium-sized dinosaurs, and there is fossil evidence of ''Siamosaurus'' itself eating [[Sauropoda|sauropod]] dinosaurs, either via scavenging or active hunting. ''Siamosaurus'' lived in a [[Semi-arid climate|semi-arid]] habitat of [[Floodplain|floodplains]] and meandering rivers, where it coexisted with other theropod, sauropod, and (in at least the Khok Kruat Formation) [[Iguanodontia|iguanodontian]] dinosaurs. [[Isotope analysis]] of spinosaurid teeth indicates they may have had [[semiaquatic]] habits, and ''Siamosaurus''<nowiki/>'s role as a largely piscivorous predator might have reduced the prominence of contemporaneous [[Crocodilia|crocodilians]] competing for the same food source.\n\n== History of discovery ==\n[[File:Cretaceous_strata_in_northeast_and_southeastern_Thailand.png|thumb|left|Geological map of the [[Khorat Plateau]] in northeast Thailand]]\n\nThe [[Sao Khua Formation]], where the first ''Siamosaurus'' [[Fossil|fossils]] were discovered, is part of the [[Khorat Group]].<ref name=\":0\">Buffetaut, E.; and Ingevat, R.

It is among the larger teeth discovered by Buffetaut and Ingavat, one much smaller specimen (DMR TF 2043b) measures {{Convert|24.3|mm||abbr=on}} in length. According to the authors, this dramatic size range suggests the teeth are from individuals of different ages. The holotype tooth is relatively straight, with only minor front to back curvature. It is oval in cross section while other specimens are nearly circular in this aspect. Unlike in most theropods, the [[Glossary of dinosaur anatomy#carinae|carinae]] (cutting edges) of ''Siamosaurus''{{'}}s teeth lack well-defined serrations.

The ''Siamosaurus'' morphotype also shares with ''Siamosaurus suteethorni'', GMNH-PV-999, and IVPP V 4793 a wrinkled enamel surface, and between 12 to 15 flutes on each side.''<ref name=\":24\" />''\n\n=== Possible material ===\n[[File:Sebayashi_spinosaurid_teeth.png|thumb|left|Partial tooth of an indeterminate spinosaurid (KDC-PV-0003) and possible ''Siamosaurus'' tooth (GMNH-PV-999), in the [[National Museum of Nature and Science]], Tokyo]]\n\nThe first Sebayashi Formation specimen (GMNH-PV-999) is an isolated tooth crown with a partially intact root. It is unknown on which jaw the tooth was positioned nor which surface faced the inside or outside of the mouth. The tooth's front and back carinae are well-defined, though the former is not well preserved. Besides having a broader, {{Convert|20 by 14|mm||adj=on|abbr=on}} wide base and being slightly smaller at {{Convert|51|mm||abbr=on}} in length, GMNH-PV-999 has a very similar morphology to the ''Siamosaurus suteethorni'' holotype. Features shared between the two specimens include: a straight and only slightly compressed shape; a somewhat oval cross section; no serrations on the carinae (possibly due to bad preservation); and flutes on the crown surface, the Japan specimen having 12 on each side. The specimens also share a crown surface with numerous small granular structures oriented parallel to their lengths. Because of these resemblances, Hasegawa and colleagues regarded GMNH-PV-999 as nearly identical to the ''Siamosaurus suteethorni'' holotype tooth.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\nKDC-PV-0003, the second tooth found in the Sebayashi Formation, consists of a slightly recurved crown fragment with a preserved length of {{Convert|10|mm||abbr=on}}, the top and bottom of the tooth having broken off. At its base, the crown is {{Convert|7.4|mm||abbr=on}} long and {{Convert|6.8|mm||abbr=on}} wide, with an almost circular cross section. Though less complete than the former specimens, KDC-PV-0003 exhibits better preservation of small details such as visible serrations, although poorly defined ones. The denticles, of which there are two to three every {{Convert|1|mm||adj=on|abbr=on}}, are visible only on the front carinae, due to the rear of the tooth being obscured by rock [[Matrix (geology)|matrix]]. A {{Convert|5.5|mm||adj=on|abbr=on}} long gap at the fossil's base exposes the dentine, which is covered in a {{Convert|1.6|mm||adj=on|abbr=on}} thick layer of enamel. The little that is preserved of KDC-PV-0003 shows that like the first Sebayashi Formation tooth, it has a granular texture and a minimum of 12 flutes on its surface, not all of which stretch to the full length of the crown. The granular structures of KDC-PV-0003 are sharper than in GMNH-PV-999. The interdenticle sulci (tiny furrows near the gaps between each denticle) of KDC-PV-0003 have an [[Oblique angle|oblique]] orientation of 45 degrees, exactly like those seen in GMNH-PV-999.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\nOut of the four teeth referred to \"''Sinopliosaurus''\" ''fusuiensis'', specimen [[IVPP]] V 4793 is the most intact, although still somewhat deformed. The crown, which is missing its tip, is {{Convert|69|mm||abbr=on}} long and {{Convert|16.5 by 13|mm||abbr=on}} wide at the base. The tooth is straight, only slightly recurved, and has an oval cross section. The front and rear carinae are distinct, though their serrations have been heavily eroded, similar to those of KDC-PV-0003. Like the Thailand and Japan teeth, the \"''Sinopliosaurus''\" ''fusuiensis'' specimens bear developed flutes and a granular surface. As in both Sebayashi Formation teeth, there are 12 flutes on each face of \"''Sinopliosaurus''\" ''fusuiensis''{{'}}s teeth. Like in KDC-PV-0003, these flutes are of varied lengths. Buffetaut and colleagues likened the \"''Sinopliosaurus''\" ''fusuiensis'' teeth most to those of ''Siamosaurus'', given their identical crown shape, fluting, and granular enamel.<ref name=\"EBetal082\" />\n\n== Classification ==\n[[File:Spinosaurus_sp_Marocco_Cenom.JPG|thumb|Tooth of the related genus ''[[Spinosaurus]]'', Museo di Storia Naturale A. Stoppani, [[Lombardy]]]]\n\nIn 1986, Buffetaut and Ingavat classified ''Siamosaurus'' as a theropod because of the straight tall crown and double lateral recurvature of its teeth. At the time, ''Siamosaurus''{{'}}s particular combination of dental characteristics, especially the longitudinal fluting and lack of serrations, had not been observed in other theropods. The authors noted similarities in ''Siamosaurus''{{'}}s teeth to those of [[Ceratosauria|ceratosaurian]] tooth crowns, some of which also have longitudinal flutes. However, this identification was ruled out, since ceratosaur teeth differ in cross section, bear far fewer dental flutes, and have distinct serrations. Buffetaut and Suteethorn concluded that the closest taxon in [[Glossary of dinosaur anatomy#dentition|dentition]] to ''Siamosaurus'' was ''[[Spinosaurus]]''. Like ''Siamosaurus,'' this African genus had straight and unserrated conical teeth, and though ''Spinosaurus'' lacked the developed flutes seen in ''Siamosaurus,'' Buffetaut and Ingavat noted that both smooth and fluted spinosaur teeth have been reported from Africa. Therefore, they tentatively placed ''Siamosaurus'' in the Spinosauridae [[Family (biology)|family]], based on close similarities in dentition to ''Spinosaurus aegyptiacus.<ref name=\":0\" />''<ref name=\":14\" />\n\nMany palaeontologists later questioned Buffetaut and Ingavat's identification of ''Siamosaurus'', given that spinosaurid teeth, including many from Asia, have often been mistaken for those of aquatic reptiles like crocodilians, plesiosaurs, and ichthyosaurs.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Buffetaut|first=Eric|date=2010|title=Spinosaurs before Stromer: early finds of spinosaurid dinosaurs and their interpretations|url=http://sp.lyellcollection.org/content/343/1/175|journal=Geological Society, London, Special Publications|language=en|volume=343|issue=1|pages=175\u2013188|bibcode=2010GSLSP.343..175B|doi=10.1144/SP343.10|issn=0305-8719|via=}}</ref> In view of this, the German palaeontologist [[Hans-Dieter Sues]] and colleagues in 2002 asserted that there is not enough material to confidently identify ''Siamosaurus'' as a dinosaur.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Sues|first=Hans-Dieter|last2=Frey|first2=Eberhard|last3=Martill|first3=David M.|last4=Scott|first4=Diane M.|date=2002|title=Irritator challengeri, a spinosaurid (Dinosauria: Theropoda) from the Lower Cretaceous of Brazil|url=|journal=Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology|language=en|volume=22|issue=3|pages=535\u2013547|doi=10.1671/0272-4634(2002)022[0535:icasdt]2.0.co;2|issn=0272-4634}}</ref> In 2004, American palaeontologist [[Thomas Holtz]] and colleagues considered it a [[dubious name]], stating that the teeth might instead belong to contemporaneous fish such as [[saurodontid]] or [[Ichthyodectidae|ichthyodectid]] [[Teleost|teleosts]].<ref name=\"HMC04\">Holtz Jr., T.R., Molnar, R.E., and Currie, P.J.

Lauprasert found that spinosaurids and crocodilians may have employed similar feeding tactics and been under comparable [[Constraint (classical mechanics)|mechanical constraints]], based on resemblances in the [[microstructure]] of their tooth enamel. Lauprasert suggested that ''Siamosaurus'' could have therefore replaced the [[ecological niche]] of contemporaneous long-snouted crocodilians as a piscivorous predator. He notes that this likely occurred in correlation with the rising aridity of the Sao Khua and Khok Kruat Formations during the Early Cretaceous, since ''Siamosaurus'' had better mobility in a dry environment than crocodilians did.

The study revealed that, among theropods, spinosaurid isotope ratios were closer to those of turtles and crocodilians. Thai spinosaurid teeth tended to have the largest difference from the ratios of other theropods, and those from Morocco tended to have the least difference. The authors concluded that spinosaurids, like modern crocodilians and hippopotamuses, were [[semiaquatic]] animals, and spent much of their daily lives in or near water. They also suggested that  piscivory and aquatic habits may explain how spinosaurids coexisted with other large theropods; by feeding on different prey items and occupying a distinct ecological role, a phenomenon known as [[niche partitioning]], the different types of theropods would have been out of direct competition.<ref name=\":21\" /><ref name=\"RMetal10\">{{cite journal |last=Amiot |first=R. |author2=Buffetaut, E. |author3=L\u00e9cuyer, C. |author4=Wang, X. |author5=Boudad, L. |author6=Ding, Z. |author7=Fourel, F. |author8=Hutt, S. |author9=Martineau, F. |author10=Medeiros, A. |author11=Mo, J. |author12=Simon, L. |author13=Suteethorn, V. |author14=Sweetman, S. |author15=Tong, H. |author16=Zhang, F. |author17=Zhou, Z. |year=2010 |title=Oxygen isotope evidence for semi-aquatic habits among spinosaurid theropods |journal=Geology |volume=38 |issue=2 |pages=139\u2013142 |doi=10.1130/G30402.1|bibcode=2010Geo....38..139A }}</ref>\n\n== Palaeoenvironment and palaeobiogeography ==\n[[File:Sao_Khua_Formation_V2.png|thumb|left|Restoration of ''Siamosaurus'' hunting fish in the Sao Khua Formation, with a herd of ''[[Phuwiangosaurus]]'' in the background]]\n\nThe sediments of the Sao Khua Formation, composed of [[Red clay|red clays]], [[Mudstone|mudstones]], [[Sandstone|sandstones]], [[Siltstone|siltstones]] and [[Conglomerate (geology)|conglomerate]] rocks, record a [[fluvial]] environment dominated by lakes, [[Floodplain|floodplains]], and meandering low-energy rivers.<ref name=\":12\" /><ref name=\":3\">{{Cite journal|last=Eric|first=Buffetaut|last2=Varavudh|first2=Suteethorn|date=1998|title=The biogeographical significance of the Mesozoic vertebrates from Thailand|url=http://doc.rero.ch/record/15441|journal=Biogeography and Geological Evolution of SE Asia|language=en}}</ref> This is consistent with the types of vertebrate fauna present in the formation, which comprise only terrestrial or freshwater animals, including dinosaurs, turtles, freshwater [[hybodont sharks]] and [[Actinopterygii|actinopterygian]] fishes, and the freshwater crocodilian ''[[Sunosuchus]]''.<ref name=\":1\" /> Besides ''Siamosaurus'', there were dinosaurs like the [[Metriacanthosauridae|metriacanthosaurid]] ''Siamotyrannus isanensis'',<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Carrano|first1=M.

In other words, the title Anti-Semite became an \u2018empty signifier, i.e. a signifier with a vague, highly variable, unspecifiable or non-existent signified. It is an empty verbal utterance that exists merely to serve a political cause (very much like Blair\u2019s WMD and Bush\u2019s Axis of Evil). Because Anti-Semite is an empty signifier, no one actually can be an Anti-Semite and this includes me of course. In short, you are either a racist which I am not or have an ideological disagreement with Zionism, which I have\".</ref> In 2009, Atzmon said \"I've got nothing against the Semite people, I don't have anything against people&nbsp;\u2014 I'm anti-Jewish, not anti-Jews.\"<ref name=\"gibson\">Gibson, Martin. \"No choice but to speak out&nbsp;\u2014 Israeli musician 'a proud self-hating Jew'\", ''The Gisborne Herald'', 23 January 2009.</ref> He added that \"Stupidly we interpreted the Nazi defeat as a vindication of the Jewish ideology and the Jewish people\"; however, \"in fact Jewish ideology and Nazi ideology were very similar.\"<ref name=\"gibson\"/> Atzmon has also stated that he does not deny the Holocaust or the \"Nazi Judeocide\u201d but insists \"that both the Holocaust and World War II should be treated as historical events rather than as religious myth. ...

{"title_page": "Subobject classifier", "text_new": "In [[category theory]], a '''subobject classifier''' is a special object \u03a9 of a category such that, intuitively, the [[subobject]]s of any object ''X'' in the category correspond to the morphisms from ''X'' to \u03a9. In typical examples, that morphism assigns \"true\" to the elements of the subobject and \"false\" to the other elements of ''X.'' Therefore, a subobject classifier is also known as a \"truth value object\" and the concept is widely used in the categorical description of logic. Note however that subobject classifiers are often much more complicated than the simple binary logic truth values {true, false}.\n\n== Introductory example ==\n\nAs an example, the set \u03a9 = {0,1} is a subobject classifier in the [[category of sets]] and functions: to every subset ''A'' of ''S'' defined by the inclusion function&nbsp;'' j '' : ''A'' \u2192 ''S'' we can assign the function ''\u03c7<sub>A</sub>'' from ''S'' to \u03a9 that maps precisely the elements of ''A'' to 1 (see [[indicator function|characteristic function]]). Every function from ''S'' to \u03a9 arises in this fashion from precisely one subset ''A''.\n\nTo be clearer, consider a [[subset]] ''A'' of ''S'' (''A'' \u2286 ''S''), where ''S'' is a set. The notion of being a subset can be expressed mathematically using the so-called characteristic function  \u03c7<sub>''A''</sub> : S \u2192 {0,1}, which is defined as follows:\n:<math>\\chi_A(x) = \n\\begin{cases} \n  0, & \\mbox{if }x\\notin A \\\\\n  1, & \\mbox{if }x\\in A\n\\end{cases}</math>\n\n(Here we interpret 1 as true and 0 as false.) The role of the characteristic function is to determine which elements belong to the subset ''A''. In fact, \u03c7<sub>''A''</sub> is true precisely on the elements of ''A''.\n\nIn this way, the collection of all subsets of ''S'' and the collection of all maps from ''S'' to \u03a9 = {0,1} are [[isomorphic]].\n\nTo categorize this notion, recall that, in category theory, a subobject is actually a pair consisting of an object and a [[monomorphism|monic arrow]] (interpreted as the inclusion into another object). Accordingly, '''true''' refers to the element 1, which is selected by the arrow: '''true''': {0} \u2192 {0, 1} that maps 0 to 1. The subset ''A'' of ''S'' can now be defined as the [[pullback (category theory)|pullback]] of '''true''' along the characteristic function \u03c7<sub>''A''</sub>, shown on the following diagram:\n[[Image:SubobjectClassifier-01.png|center]]\n \nDefined that way, \u03c7 is a morphism ''Sub''<sub>C</sub>(''S'') \u2192  Hom<sub>C</sub>(S, \u03a9). By definition, \u03a9 is a '''subobject classifier''' if this morphism is an isomorphism.\n\n== Definition ==\n\nFor the general definition, we start with a category '''C''' that has a [[terminal object]], which we denote by 1. The object \u03a9 of '''C''' is a subobject classifier for '''C''' if there exists a morphism \n:1 \u2192 \u03a9\n\nwith the following property:\n:For each [[monomorphism]] ''j'': ''U'' \u2192 ''X'' there is a unique morphism ''\u03c7<sub> j</sub>'': ''X'' \u2192 \u03a9 such that the following [[commutative diagram]]\n[[Image:SubobjectClassifier-02.png|center]]\n:is a [[pullback diagram]]\u2014that is, ''U'' is the [[limit (category theory)|limit]] of the diagram:\n[[Image:SubobjectClassifier-03.png|center]]\n\nThe morphism ''\u03c7<sub> j</sub>'' is then called the '''classifying morphism''' for the subobject represented by ''j''.\n\n== Further examples ==\n\n=== Sheaves of sets ===\nThe category of [[sheaf (mathematics)|sheaves]] of sets on a [[topological space]] ''X'' has a subobject classifier \u03a9 which can be described as follows:  For any [[open set]] ''U'' of ''X'', \u03a9(''U'') is the set of all open subsets of ''U''.  The terminal object is the sheaf 1 which assigns the [[Singleton (mathematics)|singleton]] {*} to every open set ''U'' of ''X.'' The morphism \u03b7:1 \u2192 \u03a9 is given by the family of maps \u03b7<sub>''U''</sub> : 1(''U'') \u2192 \u03a9(''U'') defined by \u03b7<sub>''U''</sub>(*)=''U'' for every open set ''U'' of ''X''.  Given a sheaf ''F'' on ''X'' and a sub-sheaf ''j'': ''G'' \u2192 ''F'', the classifying morphism ''\u03c7<sub> j</sub>'' : ''F'' \u2192 \u03a9 is given by the family of maps ''\u03c7<sub> j,U</sub>'' : ''F''(''U'') \u2192 \u03a9(''U''), where ''\u03c7<sub> j,U</sub>''(''x'') is the union of all open sets ''V'' of ''U'' such that the restriction of ''x'' to ''V'' (in the sense of sheaves) is contained in ''j<sub>V</sub>''(''G''(''V'')).\n\nRoughly speaking an assertion inside this topos is variably true or false, and its truth value from the viewpoint of an open subset ''U'' is the open subset of ''U'' where the assertion is true.\n\n=== Presheaves ===\nGiven a small category <math>C</math>, the category of [[presheaves]] <math>\\mathrm{Set}^{C^{op}}</math> (i.e. the [[functor category]] consisting of all contravariant functors from  <math>C</math> to <math>\\mathrm{Set}</math>) has a subobject classifer given by the functor sending any <math>c \\in C</math> to the set of [[Sieve (category theory)|sieves]] on <math>c</math>. The classifying morphisms are constructed quite similarly to the ones in the sheaves-of-sets example above.\n\n=== Elementary topoi ===\nBoth examples above are subsumed by the following general fact: every [[elementary topos]], defined as a category with finite [[Limit (category theory)|limits]] and [[power object]]s, necessarily has a subobject classifier.<ref>Pedicchio & Tholen (2004) p.8</ref> The two examples above are [[Topos|Grothendieck topoi]], and every Grothendieck topos is an elementary topos.\n\n== Related concepts ==\nA [[quasitopos]] has an object that is almost a subobject classifier; it only classifies strong subobjects.\n\n== Notes ==\n\n<references />\n\n== References ==\n*{{cite book\n  | last = Artin\n  | first = Michael\n  | authorlink = Michael Artin |author2=[[Alexander Grothendieck]] |author3=[[Jean-Louis Verdier]]\n  | title = S\u00e9minaire de G\u00e9ometrie Alg\u00e9brique IV\n  | publisher = [[Springer-Verlag]]\n  | year = 1964\n  | isbn = }}\n*{{cite book\n  | last = Barr\n  | first = Michael\n  |author2=Charles Wells\n   | title = Toposes, Triples and Theories\n  | publisher = [[Springer-Verlag]]\n  | year = 1985\n  | isbn = 0-387-96115-1}}\n*{{cite book\n  | last = Bell\n  | first = John\n  | title = Toposes and Local Set Theories: an Introduction\n  | publisher = [[Oxford University Press]]\n  | location = Oxford\n  | year = 1988\n  | isbn = }}\n*{{cite book\n  | last = Goldblatt\n  | first = Robert\n  | title = Topoi: The Categorial Analysis of Logic\n  | publisher = [[North-Holland]], Reprinted by Dover Publications, Inc (2006)\n  | year = 1983\n  | isbn = 0-444-85207-7\n  | url = http://historical.library.cornell.edu/cgi-bin/cul.math/docviewer?did=Gold010&id=3}}\n*{{cite book\n  | last = Johnstone\n  | first = Peter\n  | title = Sketches of an Elephant: A Topos Theory Compendium\n  | publisher = [[Oxford University Press]]\n  | location = Oxford\n  | year = 2002\n  | isbn = }}\n*{{cite book\n  | last = Johnstone\n  | first = Peter\n  | title = Topos Theory\n  | url = https://archive.org/details/topostheory0000john\n  | url-access = registration\n  | publisher = [[Academic Press]]\n  | year = 1977\n  | isbn = 0-12-387850-0}}\n* {{cite book | last=Mac Lane | first=Saunders | authorlink=Saunders Mac Lane | title=[[Categories for the Working Mathematician]] | edition=2nd | series=[[Graduate Texts in Mathematics]] | volume=5 | location=New York, NY | publisher=[[Springer-Verlag]] | year=1998 | isbn=0-387-98403-8 | zbl=0906.18001 }}\n*{{cite book\n  | last = Mac Lane\n  | first = Saunders\n  | authorlink = Saunders Mac Lane\n  |author2=Ieke Moerdijk\n   | title = Sheaves in Geometry and Logic: a First Introduction to Topos Theory\n  | publisher = [[Springer-Verlag]]\n  | location = \n  | year = 1992\n  | isbn = 0-387-97710-4}}\n*{{cite book\n  | last = McLarty\n  | first = Colin\n  | authorlink=Colin McLarty\n  | title = Elementary Categories, Elementary Toposes\n  | publisher = [[Oxford University Press]]\n  | location = Oxford\n  | year = 1992\n  | isbn = 0-19-853392-6}}\n* {{cite book | editor1-last=Pedicchio | editor1-first=Maria Cristina | editor2-last=Tholen | editor2-first=Walter | title=Categorical foundations.

The classifying morphisms are constructed quite similar to the ones in the sheaves-of-sets example above.\n\n=== Elementary topoi ===\nBoth examples above are subsumed by the following general fact: every [[elementary topos]], defined as a category with finite [[Limit (category theory)|limits]] and [[power object]]s, necessarily has a subobject classifier.<ref>Pedicchio & Tholen (2004) p.8</ref> The two examples above are [[Topos|Grothendieck topoi]], and every Grothendieck topos is an elementary topos.\n\n== Related concepts ==\nA [[quasitopos]] has an object that is almost a subobject classifier; it only classifies strong subobjects.\n\n== Notes ==\n\n<references />\n\n== References ==\n*{{cite book\n  | last = Artin\n  | first = Michael\n  | authorlink = Michael Artin |author2=[[Alexander Grothendieck]] |author3=[[Jean-Louis Verdier]]\n  | title = S\u00e9minaire de G\u00e9ometrie Alg\u00e9brique IV\n  | publisher = [[Springer-Verlag]]\n  | year = 1964\n  | isbn = }}\n*{{cite book\n  | last = Barr\n  | first = Michael\n  |author2=Charles Wells\n   | title = Toposes, Triples and Theories\n  | publisher = [[Springer-Verlag]]\n  | year = 1985\n  | isbn = 0-387-96115-1}}\n*{{cite book\n  | last = Bell\n  | first = John\n  | title = Toposes and Local Set Theories: an Introduction\n  | publisher = [[Oxford University Press]]\n  | location = Oxford\n  | year = 1988\n  | isbn = }}\n*{{cite book\n  | last = Goldblatt\n  | first = Robert\n  | title = Topoi: The Categorial Analysis of Logic\n  | publisher = [[North-Holland]], Reprinted by Dover Publications, Inc (2006)\n  | year = 1983\n  | isbn = 0-444-85207-7\n  | url = http://historical.library.cornell.edu/cgi-bin/cul.math/docviewer?did=Gold010&id=3}}\n*{{cite book\n  | last = Johnstone\n  | first = Peter\n  | title = Sketches of an Elephant: A Topos Theory Compendium\n  | publisher = [[Oxford University Press]]\n  | location = Oxford\n  | year = 2002\n  | isbn = }}\n*{{cite book\n  | last = Johnstone\n  | first = Peter\n  | title = Topos Theory\n  | url = https://archive.org/details/topostheory0000john\n  | url-access = registration\n  | publisher = [[Academic Press]]\n  | year = 1977\n  | isbn = 0-12-387850-0}}\n* {{cite book | last=Mac Lane | first=Saunders | authorlink=Saunders Mac Lane | title=[[Categories for the Working Mathematician]] | edition=2nd | series=[[Graduate Texts in Mathematics]] | volume=5 | location=New York, NY | publisher=[[Springer-Verlag]] | year=1998 | isbn=0-387-98403-8 | zbl=0906.18001 }}\n*{{cite book\n  | last = Mac Lane\n  | first = Saunders\n  | authorlink = Saunders Mac Lane\n  |author2=Ieke Moerdijk\n   | title = Sheaves in Geometry and Logic: a First Introduction to Topos Theory\n  | publisher = [[Springer-Verlag]]\n  | location = \n  | year = 1992\n  | isbn = 0-387-97710-4}}\n*{{cite book\n  | last = McLarty\n  | first = Colin\n  | authorlink=Colin McLarty\n  | title = Elementary Categories, Elementary Toposes\n  | publisher = [[Oxford University Press]]\n  | location = Oxford\n  | year = 1992\n  | isbn = 0-19-853392-6}}\n* {{cite book | editor1-last=Pedicchio | editor1-first=Maria Cristina | editor2-last=Tholen | editor2-first=Walter | title=Categorical foundations.
