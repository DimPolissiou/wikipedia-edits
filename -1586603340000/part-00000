The expansion occurred on January 31, 2010, as 23 Powerball members began selling Mega Millions tickets for their first drawing on February 2, 2010; likewise, 10 Mega Millions members began selling Powerball tickets for their first drawing the next day. [[Montana]] (joining Mega Millions on March 1, 2010) was the first jurisdiction to add either game after the cross-sell expansion. [[Nebraska]] (March 20, 2010), [[Oregon]] (March 28, 2010), [[Arizona]] (April 18, 2010), [[Maine]] (May 9, 2010), [[Colorado]] and [[South Dakota]] (the latter two on May 16, 2010) also have joined Mega Millions since the expansion.\n\nAs of January 2020, there were 47 lotteries offering Mega Millions ''and'' Powerball; Florida joined Mega Millions in May 2013. (Puerto Rico, whose lottery began in the 1930s, currently does not offer Mega Millions.) Mississippi began selling lottery tickets in 2019; it joined Mega Millions on January 30, 2020.\n\nBefore the agreement, the only stores which sold Mega Millions ''and'' Powerball tickets were retailers whose business was on a border between jurisdictions which sold competing games.\n\nThe current Mega Millions format began in October 2017. Plays are $2 per game. For an additional $1 per play, the ''Megaplier'', if activated, multiplies non-jackpot prizes.

''The Big Game'' was created and designed by Michigan Lottery Commissioner Bill Martin and Illinois Lottery Director Desiree Rogers after having discussions regarding a multi-state game with lottery directors [[Rebecca Paul]] of the Georgia Lottery and [[Penelope W. Kyle]] of the Virginia Lottery. ''The Big Game'' initially was drawn weekly, on Friday.\n\nThe Georgia Lottery was a member of MUSL at the time and wanted to sell both games for the remainder of 1996; however, within a few days, Georgia was forcibly removed from MUSL, returning with the 2010 cross-selling expansion.\n\nBeginning in January 1999, jackpot winners were given the option to receive their prize in [[present value|cash]]. In May 1999, [[New Jersey]] joined ''The Big Game'', the only jurisdiction to enter as a participant before ''The Big Game'' became Mega Millions in 2002.\n\n{{clear}}\n\n===''The Big Game Mega Millions''===\n[[File:The Big Game Mega Millions Logo.png|thumb|201px|right|''The Big Game Mega Millions'' logo following the addition of the name ''Mega Millions'']] Ohio and New York joined ''The Big Game'' consortium on May 15, 2002, when the game was renamed ''The Big Game Mega Millions'', temporarily retaining the old name and the original \"gold ball\" logo. The \"Big Money Ball\" became the \"Mega Ball.\" While the game's name was altered, the yellow ball in the new Mega Millions logo continued to read \"The Big Game\" until February 2003, after which it was replaced with six stars representing the original members of the consortium. The first ''(The Big Game) Mega Millions'' drawing was held two days later, on May 17. The Mega Millions trademark is owned by the Illinois Lottery. The first three lotteries to join Mega Millions were [[Washington (state)|Washington]] (in September 2002), [[Texas]] (in 2003), and [[California]] (in 2005); California was the last addition to Mega Millions before the cross-sell expansion of 2010. Montana joined Mega Millions on March 1, 2010, the first addition to Mega Millions after the cross-sell expansion.\n\nWhen Texas joined Mega Millions in 2003, it began offering an option, initially available only to Texas Lottery players, known as the ''Megaplier'', which was similar to Powerball's ''Power Play''. The 11 Mega Millions lotteries without ''Megaplier'' on the January 31, 2010 cross-selling date gradually added the multiplier option; by January 2011, all Mega Millions lotteries, except for California, offered the ''Megaplier''. The Texas Lottery owns the trademark to ''Megaplier''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mainelottery.com/games/megamillions.shtml |title=Mega Millions with Megaplier: Maine State Lottery |publisher=Mainelottery.com |date=2013-09-24 |accessdate=2013-12-18}}</ref>\n\nOn June 24, 2005, to commemorate California joining Mega Millions, that night's drawing was held in [[Hollywood]], with [[Carrie Underwood]] assisting host Glenn Burns for the draw.\n\nFor the November 15, 2005 drawing, a group called \"The Lucky 7\" held the only jackpot-winning ticket, purchased in [[Anaheim, California]], winning $315 million.

In October 2009, an agreement between Mega Millions and MUSL allowed all U.S. lotteries, including New Jersey's, to offer both games. On January 31, 2010, Mega Millions expanded to include the 23 MUSL members; as of that date, 35 jurisdictions were participating in Mega Millions. On the same day, 10 existing Mega Millions-participating lotteries began selling Powerball tickets. Ohio joined Powerball on April 16, 2010. On March 1, 2010, Montana became the first MUSL member to add Mega Millions ''after'' the cross-sell expansion. Nebraska became the 37th Mega Millions participating member on March 20, 2010, followed by Oregon as the 38th member on March 28, Arizona as the 39th member on April 18, and Maine as 40th Mega Millions participant on May 9, 2010. Colorado and South Dakota added Mega Millions on May 16, 2010, bringing the total to 42 jurisdictions.\n\nRecent additions to Mega Millions included the [[U.S. Virgin Islands]], in October 2010, and Louisiana in November 2011. Florida joined Mega Millions on May 15, 2013; the first drawing to include Florida-bought tickets was two days later.\n\nPresumably due to their experience with the ''Power Play'' option for Powerball, all 23 lotteries joining Mega Millions on January 31, 2010 immediately offered ''Megaplier'' to their players. The ''Megaplier'' continues to be drawn by Texas Lottery computers, as California does not offer the multiplier. Montana, offering Powerball before the expansion date, became the 24th lottery to offer the Megaplier, followed by Nebraska (the 25th), Oregon (the 26th), Arizona (as the 27th) and Maine (as the 28th lottery to offer the ''Megaplier'' option). After Colorado and South Dakota joined Mega Millions, this raised the number of lotteries offering the ''Megaplier'' to 37.\n\nMega Millions tickets bought with the Megaplier option, beginning September 12, 2010, automatically won $1 million (instead of $250,000) if the five white balls \u2013 but excluding the Mega Ball \u2013 are matched.\n\nOn March 13, 2010, New Jersey became the first Mega Millions participant (just before the cross-sell expansion) to produce a jackpot-winning ticket for Powerball after joining that game. The ticket was worth over $211 million annuity (the cash option was chosen). On May 28, 2010, North Carolina became the first Powerball member (just before the cross-selling expansion) to produce a jackpot-winning Mega Millions ticket after joining Mega Millions, with an annuity jackpot of $12 million.\n\nIn January 2012, Mega Millions' rival Powerball was altered; among the changes were a price increase of $1 for each play, as a result, a base game costs $2, or $3 with the ''Power Play'' option. At the time, there were no plans to change the price of a Mega Millions play, with or without the ''Megaplier'' (see below for the 2017 format change that includes the base price for a Mega Millions play to be raised to $2). The price increase for playing Powerball was a major factor in [[Louisiana]] deciding to pursue joining Mega Millions, as that state's lottery joined Mega Millions on November 16, 2011.\n\n===October 2013 format change===\nThe final 5/56 + 1/46 Mega Millions drawing was held on October 18, 2013; that night's jackpot of $37 million was not won. The first drawing under the revised 5/75 + 1/15 format\u2014which saw the jackpot estimate \"leap\" to $55 million due to the change in the annuity structure\u2014occurred on October 22, 2013. The minimum jackpot was then $15 million, with rollovers of at least $5 million. Second prize (5+0) became $1 million cash. In the revised format, players chose 5 of 75 white ball numbers, and the \"Gold Ball\" number out of 15.\n\nThe ''Megaplier'' option remained; the 5x multiplier was added.\n\nLower prize tiers (through October 18, 2013) based on a $1 play:\n*Match 5+0: $250,000\n*Match 4+MB: $10,000\n*Match 4+0: $150\n*Match 3+MB: $150\n*Match 3+0: $7\n*Match 2+MB: $10\n*Match 1+MB: $3\n*Match 0+MB: $2\n\nPayouts in California remained [[Parimutuel betting|pari-mutuel]].\n\nThe odds of winning or sharing a Mega Millions jackpot (October 19, 2013 \u2013 October 27, 2017): 1 in about 258.9 million. The overall odds of winning a prize were 1 in 14.71, including the base $1 prize for a \"Mega Ball\"-only match.\n\nPrizes and odds (2013-2017 version) based on a $1 play:\n*5 numbers plus the Mega Ball (5+1): Jackpot; 1 in 258,890,850\n*5 numbers but not the Mega Ball (5+0): $1,000,000; $ 1 in 17,259,390\n*4+1: $5,000; 1 in 739,688 \n*4+0: $500; 1 in 52,835\n*3+1: $50; 1 in 10,720\n*3+0: $5; 1 in 766\n*2+1: $5; 1 in 473\n*1+1: $2; 1 in 56\n*Mega Ball ''only'': $1; 1 in 21\n\nThe odds for winning the $1 prize, 1 in 21, reflected the possibility of matching ''none'' of the white balls, but matching the Mega Ball.\n\nThe annuity\u2014which was 20 annual payments (no cash option was available) when ''The Big Game'' began\u2014changed from 26 equal yearly installments to 30 graduated annual payments (increasing 5 percent yearly) with the format change on October 19, 2013.\n\n===October 2017 format/price point change===\nOn October 28, 2017, the price of a Mega Millions play doubled, to $2; the first drawing under the current price point was October 31, 2017. The Mega Millions double matrix changed, from 5/75 + 1/15 to the current 5/70 + 1/25.<ref>[blog.timesunion.com/capitol/archives/274243/mega-millions-lottery-tickets-will-go-from-1-to-2/ Mega Millions lottery tickets will go from $1 to $2]</ref> The starting jackpot became $40 million, with minimum rollovers of $5 million. The \"Megaplier\" option (which again is not offered in California) was retained, with an adjustment to its multipliers. (The final jackpot for the $1 version was $30 million, which was not won; the initial jackpot for the new version would still be $40 million with a jackpot hit.)\n\nMega Millions' non-California prize tiers effective October 28, 2017 (old prizes in parentheses; changed amounts in '''boldface''') for a $2 base play:\n\n* 5+MB: Jackpot; '''starting jackpot raised to $40 million (annuity value)'''\n* 5+0: $1,000,000 ($1,000,000)\n* 4+MB: '''$10,000''' ($5,000)\n* 4+0: $500 ($500)\n* 3+MB: '''$200''' ($50)\n* 3+0: '''$10''' ($5)\n* 2+MB: '''$10''' ($5)\n* 1+MB: '''$4''' ($2)\n* 0+MB: '''$2''' ($1)\n\nThe new prize structure allocates roughly 75 percent of the prize pool for the jackpot; this is, in part, to facilitate the new ''Just the Jackpot'' option. The 2013-2017 version allocated about 68 percent towards the jackpot.\n\n====\"Just the Jackpot\" option====\n\nIn preparation for the October 28, 2017 format change the then-46 Mega Millions members were given the '''choice''' of offering a $3, two-game play (called \"Just the Jackpot\"). A player choosing this option is not eligible for any of the eight lower-tier prizes; therefore, the Megaplier option is not available for ''Just the Jackpot'' wagers.\n\nThese lotteries offered the \"Just the Jackpot\" option upon the format change: [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], [[Indiana]], [[Kansas]], [[Massachusetts]], [[Nebraska]], [[New Jersey]], [[New Mexico]], [[New York (state)|New York]], [[Ohio]], [[South Dakota]], [[Texas]], [[Virginia]], [[Wisconsin]], and [[Wyoming]]. [[Kentucky]] has since added \"Just the Jackpot\", with other lotteries potentially adding it. Not known is whether a second series of playslips would be printed for lotteries offering \"Just the Jackpot\" beginning after the October 28, 2017 format change.\n\n\"Just the Jackpot\" wagers and regular Mega Millions plays are printed on separate tickets. Most ''Just the Jackpot'' wagers are terminal-generated; however, ''JtJ'' wagers in Kansas and Texas allow the player to choose their numbers, while Wisconsin players must ask for a terminal-generated ticket.\n\nAs of January 2020, there has yet to be a jackpot winner from a ''Just the Jackpot'' wager; there also is no known count of ''JtJ'' wagers that would have won second prize (5+0) with a traditional Mega Millions play.\n\n==Record jackpots==\nThe largest Mega Millions jackpot, $1.537 billion, was won on October 23, 2018 by one ticket, sold in South Carolina. This prize, the largest for one set of numbers in world history, was the second largest lottery payout, behind Powerball's $1.586 billion jackpot won on January 13, 2016 by multiple tickets. The record Mega Millions jackpot was claimed on March 5, 2019, with the winner choosing to remain anonymous under South Carolina law.<ref>[https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/2019/03/04/mystery-winner-finally-claims-billion-mega-millions-jackpot-ending-months-speculation/]</ref>\n\nThe second-largest Mega Millions jackpot advertised as $640 million at the time of the drawing (annuitized) or $462 million (cash value), was drawn on March 30, 2012. The initial estimate for that drawing (following the March 27 drawing, which was $363 million annuity) was $476 million (later increased to $500 million and again to $540 million); brisk ticket sales pushed the jackpot values, both annuitized (to $656 million) and the cash option ($474 million) higher. The amount spent on Mega Millions for drawings following its previous jackpot win, on January 24, 2012, was at least $1.5 [[1,000,000,000|billion]].<ref>{{cite news |newspaper=Los Angeles Times |date=March 31, 2012 |title=Mega Millions mania leads to disappointment in California |author1=Matt Stevens |author2=Carol J.

Two tickets, one each from Georgia and New Jersey, won $195 million (annuity value) each.

(Neither ''Megaplier'' nor ''Power Play'' are offered in California because its [[California Penal Code|state penal code]] distinguishes between a \"lottery\" in which the bank cannot be \"broken\", and a \"banked game\" whose [[Breaking the bank|bank theoretically could be broken]]; only a \"lottery\" was authorized by the state Lottery Act.) By adding $1 to a basic Mega Millions game, to $3, a player has an opportunity to multiply any non-jackpot prize by 2, 3, 4, or 5. The ''Megaplier'' is drawn by the Texas Lottery (before the cross-sell expansion on January 31, 2010, it was the only lottery to offer ''Megaplier''), it is drawn by a [[random number generator]] (RNG). The odds for each ''Megaplier'' possibility are not uniform.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.molottery.com/mega_millions/mega_millions.jsp |title=Mega Millions :: The official Web site of the Missouri Lottery |publisher=Molottery.com |date= |accessdate=2011-12-21}}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Megaplier\n!Former odds (October 19, 2013 \u2013 October 27, 2017)\n!Current odds \n|-\n|2x\n|1:6.5\n|1:2\n|-\n|3x\n|1:2.75\n|1:1.5\n|-\n|4x\n|1:4\n|1:4\n|-\n|5x\n|1:1.5\n|1:14\n|-\n|}\n\n''Megaplier'' wagers made for drawings from September 12, 2010 through October 18, 2013 that won second prize (then $250,000) were automatically elevated to 4x, winning $1 million.

Therefore, (75 x 74 x 73 x 72 x 71)/ (5 x 4 x 3 x 2 x 1) x 15 = 258,890,850, which means any combination of five white balls plus the Megaball has a 1:258,890,850 chance of winning the jackpot. Similarly, the odds for second prize were 1:(<sub>75</sub>C<sub>5</sub>) x (15/14) = 1: 18,492,204 chance of winning. The overall probability of winning any prize was 1 in 14.7. If there are no jackpot winners for a specific drawing, the jackpot will keep increasing; however, the odds will still remain the same.\n\nPayouts through October 18, 2013:\n{| cellspacing=3; class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!colspan=2|Matches<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n!rowspan=2|Prize\n!rowspan=2|Approximate probability of winning\n|-\n|White balls (pool of 56)\n|Mega Ball (pool of 46)\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| 5\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| 1\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| Jackpot<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/>\n|1 in 175,711,536 (<sub>56</sub>C<sub>5</sub>\u00d746)<ref>{{cite web\n| url = http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=%2856+choose+5%29*46\n| title = (56 choose 5)*46\n| accessdate = 2013-12-18 | date = 2013-12-18| publisher = [[Google]]\n}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.khanacademy.org/math/probability/v/mega-millions-jackpot-probability |publisher=Khan Academy |title=Mega Millions Jackpot Probability |author=Sal Khan}}</ref>\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|5\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|0\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| $250,000\n|1 in 3,904,701 (<sub>56</sub>C<sub>5</sub>\u00d746/45)<ref>[http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=%28%2856%20choose%205%29*46%29/%28%285%20choose%205%29*%2851%20choose%200%29*45%29 ((56 choose 5)*46)/((5 choose 5)*(51 choose 0)*45) - Google Search<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|4\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|1\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| $10,000\n|1 in 689,065<ref>[http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=%28%2856%20choose%205%29*46%29/%28%285%20choose%204%29*%2851%20choose%201%29%29 ((56 choose 5)*46)/((5 choose 4)*(51 choose 1)) - Google Search<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|4\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|0\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| $150\n|1 in 15,313<ref>[http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=%28%2856%20choose%205%29*46%29/%28%285%20choose%204%29*%2851%20choose%201%29*45%29 ((56 choose 5)*46)/((5 choose 4)*(51 choose 1)*45) - Google Search<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|3\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|1\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| $150\n|1 in 13,781<ref>[http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=%28%2856%20choose%205%29*46%29/%28%285%20choose%203%29*%2851%20choose%202%29%29 ((56 choose 5)*46)/((5 choose 3)*(51 choose 2)) - Google Search<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|2\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|1\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| $10\n|1 in 844<ref>[http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=%28%2856%20choose%205%29*46%29/%28%285%20choose%202%29*%2851%20choose%203%29%29 ((56 choose 5)*46)/((5 choose 2)*(51 choose 3)) - Google Search<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|3\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|0\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| $7\n|1 in 306<ref>[http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=%28%2856%20choose%205%29*46%29/%28%285%20choose%203%29*%2851%20choose%202%29*45%29 ((56 choose 5)*46)/((5 choose 3)*(51 choose 2)*45) - Google Search<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|1\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|1\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| $3\n|1 in 141<ref>[http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=%28%2856%20choose%205%29*46%29/%28%285%20choose%201%29*%2851%20choose%204%29%29 ((56 choose 5)*46)/((5 choose 1)*(51 choose 4)) - Google Search<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|0\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|1\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| $2\n|1 in 74.8 (the probability for this prize was not 1:46, because there is the possibility of matching at least one of the \"white\" balls, which decreases the likelihood of matching ''only'' the \"Mega Ball\")<ref name=MMHow />\n|}\n\nOverall probabilities: 1 in 755 of winning any of the top six prizes,<ref name=MMHow /> 1 in 40 of winning any prize.<ref name=\"Lotto numbers\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.lottonumbers.net/usa/megamillions/ |title=Lotto Numbers |access-date=2011-12-02 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111212014739/http://www.lottonumbers.net/usa/megamillions/ |archive-date=2011-12-12 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nIn California, prize levels are paid on a [[parimutuel]] basis, rather than the fixed lower-tier amounts for winners in other Mega Millions jurisdictions.

Around the same time, for entirely different reasons, Ohio's governor also gave the green light to joining a multi-jurisdictional game. Both lotteries opted to join ''The Big Game'', which, at the time, was offered in seven states. The added populations of the two new jurisdictions, in turn, led to a larger double matrix. The first machine continued to hold white 52 balls, while 16 gold balls were added in the second, meaning there were 52 numbers to pick from in both parts of each $1 game. On May 15, 2002, the game was renamed ''The Big Game Mega Millions''; shortly after, it became just ''Mega Millions''. Except for the 2010 cross-selling expansion, this was the only time ''The Big Game'' or Mega Millions simultaneously added more than one member.\n\nIn 2005, Mega Millions was the target of a mailing scam. A letter bearing the Mega Millions logo was used in a string of lottery scams designed to trick people into providing personal financial information by cashing bogus checks. The letter, which had been sent to people in several states via standard mail, included a check for what the scammers said was an unclaimed Mega Millions prize. If the check was cashed, it bounced, but not before the bank stamped it with a routing number and personal account information and sent it back to the fraudulent organization, providing them with the recipients' financial information.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.scamfraudalert.com/f23/mega-millions-logo-officials-warn-lottery-scams-5259/ |title=Mega Millions Logo Officials Warn of Lottery scams |publisher=ScamFraudAlert |date=2011-11-28 |accessdate=2011-12-21}}</ref>\n\nA budget impasse due to the [[2006 New Jersey Government shutdown]] led to the temporary closing of its non-essential agencies on July 1, 2006. Among the casualties were the [[Atlantic City]] casinos and the [[New Jersey Lottery]]. Not only were New Jersey's in-house games (such as [[New Jersey Pick 6|Pick-6]]) not drawn for about a week, but all New Jersey lottery terminals were shut down, meaning Mega Millions could not be played in New Jersey, even though Mega Millions was drawn as usual.

One such usage involved character [[Hugo \"Hurley\" Reyes]] playing the sequence in a similar \"Mega Lotto\" game, winning a nine-figure jackpot and subsequently experiencing numerous misfortunes in his personal life. The first three numbers (4, 8, 15) and mega ball (42) in the Mega Millions drawing matched the first three numbers and the final number (which Hurley also used as the \"mega ball\" number) in the ''Lost'' sequence. The last two numbers in the Mega Millions drawing did not match the last two numbers that were used in the scene.

The expansion occurred on January 31, 2010, as 23 Powerball members began selling Mega Millions tickets for their first drawing on February 2, 2010; likewise, 10 Mega Millions members began selling Powerball tickets for their first drawing the next day. [[Montana]] (joining Mega Millions on March 1, 2010) was the first jurisdiction to add either game after the cross-sell expansion. [[Nebraska]] (March 20, 2010), [[Oregon]] (March 28, 2010), [[Arizona]] (April 18, 2010), [[Maine]] (May 9, 2010), [[Colorado]] and [[South Dakota]] (the latter two on May 16, 2010) also have joined Mega Millions since the expansion.\n\nAs of January 2020, there were 47 lotteries offering Mega Millions ''and'' Powerball; Florida joined Mega Millions in May 2013. (Puerto Rico, whose lottery began in the 1930s, currently does not offer Mega Millions.) Mississippi began selling lottery tickets in 2019; it joined Mega Millions on January 30, 2020.\n\nBefore the agreement, the only stores which sold Mega Millions ''and'' Powerball tickets were retailers whose business was on a border between jurisdictions which sold competing games.\n\nThe current Mega Millions format began in October 2017. Plays are $2 per game. For an additional $1 per play, the ''Megaplier'', if activated, multiplies non-jackpot prizes.

''The Big Game'' was created and designed by Michigan Lottery Commissioner Bill Martin and Illinois Lottery Director Desiree Rogers after having discussions regarding a multi-state game with lottery directors [[Rebecca Paul]] of the Georgia Lottery and [[Penelope W. Kyle]] of the Virginia Lottery. ''The Big Game'' initially was drawn weekly, on Friday.\n\nThe Georgia Lottery was a member of MUSL at the time and wanted to sell both games for the remainder of 1996; however, within a few days, Georgia was forcibly removed from MUSL, returning with the 2010 cross-selling expansion.\n\nBeginning in January 1999, jackpot winners were given the option to receive their prize in [[present value|cash]]. In May 1999, [[New Jersey]] joined ''The Big Game'', the only jurisdiction to enter as a participant before ''The Big Game'' became Mega Millions in 2002.\n\n{{clear}}\n\n===''The Big Game Mega Millions''===\n[[File:The Big Game Mega Millions Logo.png|thumb|201px|right|''The Big Game Mega Millions'' logo following the addition of the name ''Mega Millions'']] Ohio and New York joined ''The Big Game'' consortium on May 15, 2002, when the game was renamed ''The Big Game Mega Millions'', temporarily retaining the old name and the original \"gold ball\" logo. The \"Big Money Ball\" became the \"Mega Ball.\" While the game's name was altered, the yellow ball in the new Mega Millions logo continued to read \"The Big Game\" until February 2003, after which it was replaced with six stars representing the original members of the consortium. The first ''(The Big Game) Mega Millions'' drawing was held two days later, on May 17. The Mega Millions trademark is owned by the Illinois Lottery. The first three lotteries to join Mega Millions were [[Washington (state)|Washington]] (in September 2002), [[Texas]] (in 2003), and [[California]] (in 2005); California was the last addition to Mega Millions before the cross-sell expansion of 2010. Montana joined Mega Millions on March 1, 2010, the first addition to Mega Millions after the cross-sell expansion.\n\nWhen Texas joined Mega Millions in 2003, it began offering an option, initially available only to Texas Lottery players, known as the ''Megaplier'', which was similar to Powerball's ''Power Play''. The 11 Mega Millions lotteries without ''Megaplier'' on the January 31, 2010 cross-selling date gradually added the multiplier option; by January 2011, all Mega Millions lotteries, except for California, offered the ''Megaplier''. The Texas Lottery owns the trademark to ''Megaplier''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mainelottery.com/games/megamillions.shtml |title=Mega Millions with Megaplier: Maine State Lottery |publisher=Mainelottery.com |date=2013-09-24 |accessdate=2013-12-18}}</ref>\n\nOn June 24, 2005, to commemorate California joining Mega Millions, that night's drawing was held in [[Hollywood]], with [[Carrie Underwood]] assisting host Glenn Burns for the draw.\n\nFor the November 15, 2005 drawing, a group called \"The Lucky 7\" held the only jackpot-winning ticket, purchased in [[Anaheim, California]], winning $315 million.

In October 2009, an agreement between Mega Millions and MUSL allowed all U.S. lotteries, including New Jersey's, to offer both games. On January 31, 2010, Mega Millions expanded to include the 23 MUSL members; as of that date, 35 jurisdictions were participating in Mega Millions. On the same day, 10 existing Mega Millions-participating lotteries began selling Powerball tickets. Ohio joined Powerball on April 16, 2010. On March 1, 2010, Montana became the first MUSL member to add Mega Millions ''after'' the cross-sell expansion. Nebraska became the 37th Mega Millions participating member on March 20, 2010, followed by Oregon as the 38th member on March 28, Arizona as the 39th member on April 18, and Maine as 40th Mega Millions participant on May 9, 2010. Colorado and South Dakota added Mega Millions on May 16, 2010, bringing the total to 42 jurisdictions.\n\nRecent additions to Mega Millions included the [[U.S. Virgin Islands]], in October 2010, and Louisiana in November 2011. Florida joined Mega Millions on May 15, 2013; the first drawing to include Florida-bought tickets was two days later.\n\nPresumably due to their experience with the ''Power Play'' option for Powerball, all 23 lotteries joining Mega Millions on January 31, 2010 immediately offered ''Megaplier'' to their players. The ''Megaplier'' continues to be drawn by Texas Lottery computers, as California does not offer the multiplier. Montana, offering Powerball before the expansion date, became the 24th lottery to offer the Megaplier, followed by Nebraska (the 25th), Oregon (the 26th), Arizona (as the 27th) and Maine (as the 28th lottery to offer the ''Megaplier'' option). After Colorado and South Dakota joined Mega Millions, this raised the number of lotteries offering the ''Megaplier'' to 37.\n\nMega Millions tickets bought with the Megaplier option, beginning September 12, 2010, automatically won $1 million (instead of $250,000) if the five white balls \u2013 but excluding the Mega Ball \u2013 are matched.\n\nOn March 13, 2010, New Jersey became the first Mega Millions participant (just before the cross-sell expansion) to produce a jackpot-winning ticket for Powerball after joining that game. The ticket was worth over $211 million annuity (the cash option was chosen). On May 28, 2010, North Carolina became the first Powerball member (just before the cross-selling expansion) to produce a jackpot-winning Mega Millions ticket after joining Mega Millions, with an annuity jackpot of $12 million.\n\nIn January 2012, Mega Millions' rival Powerball was altered; among the changes were a price increase of $1 for each play, as a result, a base game costs $2, or $3 with the ''Power Play'' option. At the time, there were no plans to change the price of a Mega Millions play, with or without the ''Megaplier'' (see below for the 2017 format change that includes the base price for a Mega Millions play to be raised to $2). The price increase for playing Powerball was a major factor in [[Louisiana]] deciding to pursue joining Mega Millions, as that state's lottery joined Mega Millions on November 16, 2011.\n\n===October 2013 format change===\nThe final 5/56 + 1/46 Mega Millions drawing was held on October 18, 2013; that night's jackpot of $37 million was not won. The first drawing under the revised 5/75 + 1/15 format\u2014which saw the jackpot estimate \"leap\" to $55 million due to the change in the annuity structure\u2014occurred on October 22, 2013. The minimum jackpot was then $15 million, with rollovers of at least $5 million. Second prize (5+0) became $1 million cash. In the revised format, players chose 5 of 75 white ball numbers, and the \"Gold Ball\" number out of 15.\n\nThe ''Megaplier'' option remained; the 5x multiplier was added.\n\nLower prize tiers (through October 18, 2013) based on a $1 play:\n*Match 5+0: $250,000\n*Match 4+MB: $10,000\n*Match 4+0: $150\n*Match 3+MB: $150\n*Match 3+0: $7\n*Match 2+MB: $10\n*Match 1+MB: $3\n*Match 0+MB: $2\n\nPayouts in California remained [[Parimutuel betting|pari-mutuel]].\n\nThe odds of winning or sharing a Mega Millions jackpot (October 19, 2013 \u2013 October 27, 2017): 1 in about 258.9 million. The overall odds of winning a prize were 1 in 14.71, including the base $1 prize for a \"Mega Ball\"-only match.\n\nPrizes and odds (2013-2017 version) based on a $1 play:\n*5 numbers plus the Mega Ball (5+1): Jackpot; 1 in 258,890,850\n*5 numbers but not the Mega Ball (5+0): $1,000,000; $ 1 in 17,259,390\n*4+1: $5,000; 1 in 739,688 \n*4+0: $500; 1 in 52,835\n*3+1: $50; 1 in 10,720\n*3+0: $5; 1 in 766\n*2+1: $5; 1 in 473\n*1+1: $2; 1 in 56\n*Mega Ball ''only'': $1; 1 in 21\n\nThe odds for winning the $1 prize, 1 in 21, reflected the possibility of matching ''none'' of the white balls, but matching the Mega Ball.\n\nThe annuity\u2014which was 20 annual payments (no cash option was available) when ''The Big Game'' began\u2014changed from 26 equal yearly installments to 30 graduated annual payments (increasing 5 percent yearly) with the format change on October 19, 2013.\n\n===October 2017 format/price point change===\nOn October 28, 2017, the price of a Mega Millions play doubled, to $2; the first drawing under the current price point was October 31, 2017. The Mega Millions double matrix changed, from 5/75 + 1/15 to the current 5/70 + 1/25.<ref>[blog.timesunion.com/capitol/archives/274243/mega-millions-lottery-tickets-will-go-from-1-to-2/ Mega Millions lottery tickets will go from $1 to $2]</ref> The starting jackpot became $40 million, with minimum rollovers of $5 million. The \"Megaplier\" option (which again is not offered in California) was retained, with an adjustment to its multipliers. (The final jackpot for the $1 version was $30 million, which was not won; the initial jackpot for the new version would still be $40 million with a jackpot hit.)\n\nMega Millions' non-California prize tiers effective October 28, 2017 (old prizes in parentheses; changed amounts in '''boldface''') for a $2 base play:\n\n* 5+MB: Jackpot; '''starting jackpot raised to $40 million (annuity value)'''\n* 5+0: $1,000,000 ($1,000,000)\n* 4+MB: '''$10,000''' ($5,000)\n* 4+0: $500 ($500)\n* 3+MB: '''$200''' ($50)\n* 3+0: '''$10''' ($5)\n* 2+MB: '''$10''' ($5)\n* 1+MB: '''$4''' ($2)\n* 0+MB: '''$2''' ($1)\n\nThe new prize structure allocates roughly 75 percent of the prize pool for the jackpot; this is, in part, to facilitate the new ''Just the Jackpot'' option. The 2013-2017 version allocated about 68 percent towards the jackpot.\n\n====\"Just the Jackpot\" option====\n\nIn preparation for the October 28, 2017 format change the then-46 Mega Millions members were given the '''choice''' of offering a $3, two-game play (called \"Just the Jackpot\"). A player choosing this option is not eligible for any of the eight lower-tier prizes; therefore, the Megaplier option is not available for ''Just the Jackpot'' wagers.\n\nThese lotteries offered the \"Just the Jackpot\" option upon the format change: [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], [[Indiana]], [[Kansas]], [[Massachusetts]], [[Nebraska]], [[New Jersey]], [[New Mexico]], [[New York (state)|New York]], [[Ohio]], [[South Dakota]], [[Texas]], [[Virginia]], [[Wisconsin]], and [[Wyoming]]. [[Kentucky]] has since added \"Just the Jackpot\", with other lotteries potentially adding it. Not known is whether a second series of playslips would be printed for lotteries offering \"Just the Jackpot\" beginning after the October 28, 2017 format change.\n\n\"Just the Jackpot\" wagers and regular Mega Millions plays are printed on separate tickets. Most ''Just the Jackpot'' wagers are terminal-generated; however, ''JtJ'' wagers in Kansas and Texas allow the player to choose their numbers, while Wisconsin players must ask for a terminal-generated ticket.\n\nAs of January 2020, there has yet to be a jackpot winner from a ''Just the Jackpot'' wager; there also is no known count of ''JtJ'' wagers that would have won second prize (5+0) with a traditional Mega Millions play.\n\n==Record jackpots==\nThe largest Mega Millions jackpot, $1.537 billion, was won on October 23, 2018 by one ticket, sold in South Carolina. This prize, the largest for one set of numbers in world history, was the second largest lottery payout, behind Powerball's $1.586 billion jackpot won on January 13, 2016 by multiple tickets. The record Mega Millions jackpot was claimed on March 5, 2019, with the winner choosing to remain anonymous under South Carolina law.<ref>[https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/2019/03/04/mystery-winner-finally-claims-billion-mega-millions-jackpot-ending-months-speculation/]</ref>\n\nThe second-largest Mega Millions jackpot advertised as $640 million at the time of the drawing (annuitized) or $462 million (cash value), was drawn on March 30, 2012. The initial estimate for that drawing (following the March 27 drawing, which was $363 million annuity) was $476 million (later increased to $500 million and again to $540 million); brisk ticket sales pushed the jackpot values, both annuitized (to $656 million) and the cash option ($474 million) higher. The amount spent on Mega Millions for drawings following its previous jackpot win, on January 24, 2012, was at least $1.5 [[1,000,000,000|billion]].<ref>{{cite news |newspaper=Los Angeles Times |date=March 31, 2012 |title=Mega Millions mania leads to disappointment in California |author1=Matt Stevens |author2=Carol J.

Two tickets, one each from Georgia and New Jersey, won $195 million (annuity value) each.

(Neither ''Megaplier'' nor ''Power Play'' are offered in California because its [[California Penal Code|state penal code]] distinguishes between a \"lottery\" in which the bank cannot be \"broken\", and a \"banked game\" whose [[Breaking the bank|bank theoretically could be broken]]; only a \"lottery\" was authorized by the state Lottery Act.) By adding $1 to a basic Mega Millions game, to $3, a player has an opportunity to multiply any non-jackpot prize by 2, 3, 4, or 5. The ''Megaplier'' is drawn by the Texas Lottery (before the cross-sell expansion on January 31, 2010, it was the only lottery to offer ''Megaplier''), it is drawn by a [[random number generator]] (RNG). The odds for each ''Megaplier'' possibility are not uniform.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.molottery.com/mega_millions/mega_millions.jsp |title=Mega Millions :: The official Web site of the Missouri Lottery |publisher=Molottery.com |date= |accessdate=2011-12-21}}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Megaplier\n!Former odds (October 19, 2013 \u2013 October 27, 2017)\n!Current odds \n|-\n|2x\n|1:6.5\n|1:2\n|-\n|3x\n|1:2.75\n|1:1.5\n|-\n|4x\n|1:4\n|1:4\n|-\n|5x\n|1:1.5\n|1:14\n|-\n|}\n\n''Megaplier'' wagers made for drawings from September 12, 2010 through October 18, 2013 that won second prize (then $250,000) were automatically elevated to 4x, winning $1 million.

Therefore, (75 x 74 x 73 x 72 x 71)/ (5 x 4 x 3 x 2 x 1) x 15 = 258,890,850, which means any combination of five white balls plus the Megaball has a 1:258,890,850 chance of winning the jackpot. Similarly, the odds for second prize were 1:(<sub>75</sub>C<sub>5</sub>) x (15/14) = 1: 18,492,204 chance of winning. The overall probability of winning any prize was 1 in 14.7. If there are no jackpot winners for a specific drawing, the jackpot will keep increasing; however, the odds will still remain the same.\n\nPayouts through October 18, 2013:\n{| cellspacing=3; class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!colspan=2|Matches<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n!rowspan=2|Prize\n!rowspan=2|Approximate probability of winning\n|-\n|White balls (pool of 56)\n|Mega Ball (pool of 46)\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| 5\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| 1\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| Jackpot<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/>\n|1 in 175,711,536 (<sub>56</sub>C<sub>5</sub>\u00d746)<ref>{{cite web\n| url = http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=%2856+choose+5%29*46\n| title = (56 choose 5)*46\n| accessdate = 2013-12-18 | date = 2013-12-18| publisher = [[Google]]\n}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.khanacademy.org/math/probability/v/mega-millions-jackpot-probability |publisher=Khan Academy |title=Mega Millions Jackpot Probability |author=Sal Khan}}</ref>\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|5\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|0\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| $250,000\n|1 in 3,904,701 (<sub>56</sub>C<sub>5</sub>\u00d746/45)<ref>[http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=%28%2856%20choose%205%29*46%29/%28%285%20choose%205%29*%2851%20choose%200%29*45%29 ((56 choose 5)*46)/((5 choose 5)*(51 choose 0)*45) - Google Search<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|4\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|1\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| $10,000\n|1 in 689,065<ref>[http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=%28%2856%20choose%205%29*46%29/%28%285%20choose%204%29*%2851%20choose%201%29%29 ((56 choose 5)*46)/((5 choose 4)*(51 choose 1)) - Google Search<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|4\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|0\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| $150\n|1 in 15,313<ref>[http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=%28%2856%20choose%205%29*46%29/%28%285%20choose%204%29*%2851%20choose%201%29*45%29 ((56 choose 5)*46)/((5 choose 4)*(51 choose 1)*45) - Google Search<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|3\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|1\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| $150\n|1 in 13,781<ref>[http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=%28%2856%20choose%205%29*46%29/%28%285%20choose%203%29*%2851%20choose%202%29%29 ((56 choose 5)*46)/((5 choose 3)*(51 choose 2)) - Google Search<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|2\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|1\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| $10\n|1 in 844<ref>[http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=%28%2856%20choose%205%29*46%29/%28%285%20choose%202%29*%2851%20choose%203%29%29 ((56 choose 5)*46)/((5 choose 2)*(51 choose 3)) - Google Search<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|3\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|0\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| $7\n|1 in 306<ref>[http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=%28%2856%20choose%205%29*46%29/%28%285%20choose%203%29*%2851%20choose%202%29*45%29 ((56 choose 5)*46)/((5 choose 3)*(51 choose 2)*45) - Google Search<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|1\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|1\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| $3\n|1 in 141<ref>[http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=%28%2856%20choose%205%29*46%29/%28%285%20choose%201%29*%2851%20choose%204%29%29 ((56 choose 5)*46)/((5 choose 1)*(51 choose 4)) - Google Search<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|0\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|1\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| $2\n|1 in 74.8 (the probability for this prize was not 1:46, because there is the possibility of matching at least one of the \"white\" balls, which decreases the likelihood of matching ''only'' the \"Mega Ball\")<ref name=MMHow />\n|}\n\nOverall probabilities: 1 in 755 of winning any of the top six prizes,<ref name=MMHow /> 1 in 40 of winning any prize.<ref name=\"Lotto numbers\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.lottonumbers.net/usa/megamillions/ |title=Lotto Numbers |access-date=2011-12-02 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111212014739/http://www.lottonumbers.net/usa/megamillions/ |archive-date=2011-12-12 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nIn California, prize levels are paid on a [[parimutuel]] basis, rather than the fixed lower-tier amounts for winners in other Mega Millions jurisdictions.

Around the same time, for entirely different reasons, Ohio's governor also gave the green light to joining a multi-jurisdictional game. Both lotteries opted to join ''The Big Game'', which, at the time, was offered in seven states. The added populations of the two new jurisdictions, in turn, led to a larger double matrix. The first machine continued to hold white 52 balls, while 16 gold balls were added in the second, meaning there were 52 numbers to pick from in both parts of each $1 game. On May 15, 2002, the game was renamed ''The Big Game Mega Millions''; shortly after, it became just ''Mega Millions''. Except for the 2010 cross-selling expansion, this was the only time ''The Big Game'' or Mega Millions simultaneously added more than one member.\n\nIn 2005, Mega Millions was the target of a mailing scam. A letter bearing the Mega Millions logo was used in a string of lottery scams designed to trick people into providing personal financial information by cashing bogus checks. The letter, which had been sent to people in several states via standard mail, included a check for what the scammers said was an unclaimed Mega Millions prize. If the check was cashed, it bounced, but not before the bank stamped it with a routing number and personal account information and sent it back to the fraudulent organization, providing them with the recipients' financial information.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.scamfraudalert.com/f23/mega-millions-logo-officials-warn-lottery-scams-5259/ |title=Mega Millions Logo Officials Warn of Lottery scams |publisher=ScamFraudAlert |date=2011-11-28 |accessdate=2011-12-21}}</ref>\n\nA budget impasse due to the [[2006 New Jersey Government shutdown]] led to the temporary closing of its non-essential agencies on July 1, 2006. Among the casualties were the [[Atlantic City]] casinos and the [[New Jersey Lottery]]. Not only were New Jersey's in-house games (such as [[New Jersey Pick 6|Pick-6]]) not drawn for about a week, but all New Jersey lottery terminals were shut down, meaning Mega Millions could not be played in New Jersey, even though Mega Millions was drawn as usual. A similar shutdown happened in [[Minnesota]] on July 1, 2011.\n\nElecia Battle made national headlines in January 2004 when she claimed that she had lost the winning ticket in the December 30, 2003 Mega Millions drawing.<ref name=\"bbcnews\">{{cite news | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/3373077.stm| title = Women argue over 'lost' jackpot | publisher = BBC News | date = 2004-01-06 | accessdate = 2008-02-19}}</ref> She then filed a lawsuit against the woman who had come forward with the ticket, Rebecca Jemison.

One such usage involved character [[Hugo \"Hurley\" Reyes]] playing the sequence in a similar \"Mega Lotto\" game, winning a nine-figure jackpot and subsequently experiencing numerous misfortunes in his personal life. The first three numbers (4, 8, 15) and mega ball (42) in the Mega Millions drawing matched the first three numbers and the final number (which Hurley also used as the \"mega ball\" number) in the ''Lost'' sequence. The last two numbers in the Mega Millions drawing did not match the last two numbers that were used in the scene.

The tour commenced on 26 December 1968 and concluded on 16 February 1969. It was important for the band, as their popularity grew substantially because of the concerts and helped them reach significant commercial success in the US, which translated to sales elsewhere.\n\n==Overview==\nThe genesis of this tour was the cancellation of a concert tour by the [[Jeff Beck Group]], which happened to be managed out of the same office occupied by Led Zeppelin's manager [[Peter Grant (music manager)|Peter Grant]]. Grant contacted the promoters and convinced them to take on Led Zeppelin instead.<ref name=complete>Liner notes by [[Cameron Crowe]] for ''[[The Complete Studio Recordings (Led Zeppelin album)|The Complete Studio Recordings]]''</ref>\n\nTo help publicise the band in America before the tour, Grant sent white label advance copies of the band's [[Led Zeppelin (album)|debut album]] to key [[FM radio]] stations.  The album itself was issued on 12 January, almost mid-way through the tour. According to tour manager [[Richard Cole]], the tour was underwritten by Grant, guitarist [[Jimmy Page]], and bass player [[John Paul Jones (musician)|John Paul Jones]], while singer [[Robert Plant]] and drummer [[John Bonham]] were paid a salary.<ref name=AtoZ>''A to Zeppelin: The Story of Led Zeppelin'', Passport Video, 2004.</ref>\n\nFor this stint of concerts, Led Zeppelin initially played as the support act for bands such as [[Vanilla Fudge]] and [[Iron Butterfly]] (both of which were also contracted to [[Atlantic Records]]) and [[Country Joe & the Fish]]. However, as the tour progressed, it became apparent that Led Zeppelin was easily outshining the headline acts.<ref name=lewispallett>Lewis, Dave and Pallett, Simon (1997) ''Led Zeppelin: The Concert File'', London: [[Omnibus Press]]. {{ISBN|0-7119-5307-4}}, p. 15.</ref><ref name=theirtime>\"Their Time is Gonna Come\", ''[[Classic Rock Magazine]]: Classic Rock Presents Led Zeppelin'', 2008, p. 17.</ref> Guitarist [[Jimmy Page]] noticed that by the time the group reached [[San Francisco]], other groups were not turning up, and Led Zeppelin were then headliners.<ref name=bioh>[[Nick Kent]], \"Bring It On Home\", ''[[Q Magazine]]'', Special Led Zeppelin edition, 2003</ref>\n\nBassist [[John Paul Jones (musician)|John Paul Jones]] believed the reason their concerts were popular was because they played tightly and quickly without many delays, saying \"we would just go on and go 'bang bang bang' with three driven songs with solos\", which other groups did not do.<ref name=Miserandino>Dominick A.

They played the same set twice, and then played an improvised set with covers from other groups such as [[The Who|Who]], [[Rolling Stones]] and [[The Beatles]]. Grant was delighted with the group's performance, and the band then realised then that they would be a very successful rock band.<ref name = \"Snow1990\" />\n\nThe show in Spokane on 30 December is among the earliest known recorded shows of the band and bootlegs can be heard on YouTube.<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MHyqOaA8wFE</ref>\n\nIt was during this tour that Led Zeppelin's drummer, [[John Bonham]], developed a close friendship with the drummer of Vanilla Fudge, [[Carmine Appice]].<ref name=\"Snow1990\">Mat Snow, \"Apocalypse Then\", ''[[Q (magazine)|Q]]'' magazine, December 1990, pp. 77, 79.</ref>\n<ref name=\"Welch\">[[Chris Welch]] (1994) ''Led Zeppelin'', London: [[Orion Books]]. {{ISBN|1-85797-930-3}}, p. 34.</ref>\nThe average fee charged by Led Zeppelin for a concert during this tour was around $1,500. It has been stated that for one show they performed for a mere $320.<ref name=lewispallett/>  Figures like these would soon be dwarfed by the six-figure sums routinely demanded, and received, by Led Zeppelin on subsequent tours as their popularity skyrocketed.

The tour commenced on 26 December 1968 and concluded on 16 February 1969. It was important for the band, as their popularity grew substantially because of the concerts and helped them reach significant commercial success in the US, which translated to sales elsewhere.\n\n==Overview==\nThe genesis of this tour was the cancellation of a concert tour by the [[Jeff Beck Group]], which happened to be managed out of the same office occupied by Led Zeppelin's manager [[Peter Grant (music manager)|Peter Grant]]. Grant contacted the promoters and convinced them to take on Led Zeppelin instead.<ref name=complete>Liner notes by [[Cameron Crowe]] for ''[[The Complete Studio Recordings (Led Zeppelin album)|The Complete Studio Recordings]]''</ref>\n\nTo help publicise the band in America before the tour, Grant sent white label advance copies of the band's [[Led Zeppelin (album)|debut album]] to key [[FM radio]] stations.  The album itself was issued on 12 January, almost mid-way though the tour. According to tour manager [[Richard Cole]], the tour was underwritten by Grant, guitarist [[Jimmy Page]], and bass player [[John Paul Jones (musician)|John Paul Jones]], while singer [[Robert Plant]] and drummer [[John Bonham]] were paid a salary.<ref name=AtoZ>''A to Zeppelin: The Story of Led Zeppelin'', Passport Video, 2004.</ref>\n\nFor this stint of concerts, Led Zeppelin initially played as the support act for bands such as [[Vanilla Fudge]] and [[Iron Butterfly]] (both of which were also contracted to [[Atlantic Records]]) and [[Country Joe & the Fish]]. However, as the tour progressed, it became apparent that Led Zeppelin was easily outshining the headline acts.<ref name=lewispallett>Lewis, Dave and Pallett, Simon (1997) ''Led Zeppelin: The Concert File'', London: [[Omnibus Press]]. {{ISBN|0-7119-5307-4}}, p. 15.</ref><ref name=theirtime>\"Their Time is Gonna Come\", ''[[Classic Rock Magazine]]: Classic Rock Presents Led Zeppelin'', 2008, p. 17.</ref> Guitarist [[Jimmy Page]] noticed that by the time the group reached [[San Francisco]], other groups were not turning up, and Led Zeppelin were then headliners.<ref name=bioh>[[Nick Kent]], \"Bring It On Home\", ''[[Q Magazine]]'', Special Led Zeppelin edition, 2003</ref>\n\nBassist [[John Paul Jones (musician)|John Paul Jones]] believed the reason their concerts were popular was because they played tightly and quickly without many delays, saying \"we would just go on and go 'bang bang bang' with three driven songs with solos\", which other groups did not do.<ref name=Miserandino>Dominick A. Miserandino, [http://thecelebritycafe.com/interviews/john_paul_jones.html Led Zeppelin \u2013 John Paul Jones] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150512202604/http://thecelebritycafe.com/interviews/john_paul_jones.html |date=2015-05-12 }}, TheCelebrityCafe.com.</ref>\n\nIn one famous concert, Led Zeppelin's final of four nights performed at the [[Boston Tea Party (concert venue)|Boston Tea Party]], the band played for more than four hours with only one album worth of material. They played the same set twice, and then played an improvised set with covers from other groups such as [[The Who|Who]], [[Rolling Stones]] and [[The Beatles]]. Grant was delighted with the group's performance, and the band then realised then that they would be a very successful rock band.<ref name = \"Snow1990\" />\n\nThe show in Spokane on 30 December is among the earliest known recorded shows of the band and bootlegs can be heard on YouTube.<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MHyqOaA8wFE</ref>\n\nIt was during this tour that Led Zeppelin's drummer, [[John Bonham]], developed a close friendship with the drummer of Vanilla Fudge, [[Carmine Appice]].<ref name=\"Snow1990\">Mat Snow, \"Apocalypse Then\", ''[[Q (magazine)|Q]]'' magazine, December 1990, pp. 77, 79.</ref>\n<ref name=\"Welch\">[[Chris Welch]] (1994) ''Led Zeppelin'', London: [[Orion Books]]. {{ISBN|1-85797-930-3}}, p. 34.</ref>\nThe average fee charged by Led Zeppelin for a concert during this tour was around $1,500. It has been stated that for one show they performed for a mere $320.<ref name=lewispallett/>  Figures like these would soon be dwarfed by the six figure sums routinely demanded, and received, by Led Zeppelin on subsequent tours as their popularity skyrocketed. Peter Grant recalled that \"[[The Yardbirds]] had been getting $2,500 a night but people like [[Bill Graham (promoter)|Bill Graham]] had faith in us and so did the kids who saw it.\"<ref name=lewispallett/> Grant, who was unable to attend the tour with the group, also stated:\n\n{{quote|I couldn't go with them, but it was a fantastic 12 date tour, and they said \"Great, if that's what we've gotta do, we'll go and do it\" ... Three of the group had never been to America before and didn't know what to expect. They did a week with the Vanilla Fudge. My instructions were for them to go over there and blast them out. Make each performance something everybody remembered.

He played for the [[West Coast Eagles]] in the [[Australian Football League|Victorian Football League/Australian Football League]] (VFL/AFL) and [[East Fremantle Football Club|East Fremantle]] in the [[West Australian Football League]] (WAFL). He was also a [[television presenter]] and [[sports journalist]] with [[TVW#Seven News|Seven News Perth]] and a [[radio presenter]] with [[Mix 94.5]].\n\n==Football career==\nMainwaring started his career with the Greenough Demons (Rovers) before being recruited by East Fremantle \"The Sharks\" in 1985. In his first season, he was a member of the [[Western Australia]]n [[Interstate matches in Australian rules football|State of Origin]] team and played in a Sharks premiership team.\n\nHe was a member of the West Coast Eagles' inaugural squad in 1987. He made his debut in round three that year, against [[Sydney Swans|Sydney]] at [[Subiaco Oval|Subiaco]] and afterwards only missed one game for the season.<ref>[http://stats.afl.com.au/public/statistics/player_roundbyround/1987/13/player_roundbyround_13_1987.shtml?club_idIndex=16&season_idIndex=20 AFL 1987 Stats] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930061638/http://stats.afl.com.au/public/statistics/player_roundbyround/1987/13/player_roundbyround_13_1987.shtml?club_idIndex=16&season_idIndex=20 |date=30 September 2007 }}</ref> and was named their best first year player.<ref>[http://www.westcoasteagles.com.au/Eagles/TheClub/History/HonourRoll/tabid/7271/Default.aspx West Coast Eagles Honour Roll]</ref> Mainwaring played for the Eagles on the [[Football (Australian rules) positions#Midfield|wing]] and contributed greatly to their success, playing in both their 1992 and 1994 premierships. The image of him leaping with joy at the conclusion of the game, despite having a broken ankle, is one of the lasting images of the Eagles' first premiership. He played 201 games for the Eagles between 1987 and 1999, kicking 84 goals. \n\nMainwaring was an [[All-Australian Team|All-Australian]] in 1991 and 1996 and has been named on the wing in the West Coast Eagles' [[West Coast Eagles#Team of the Decade|Team of the Decade]] in 1996, [[West Coast Eagles#Team 20|Team20]] in 2006 and East Fremantle's Team of the Century in 1997. Whilst he never won the [[best and fairest|Club Champion]] award at the Eagles, he finished in the top 10 eight times, including placing third in both his debut and second years in the VFL and second in 1989, 1992 and 1996.<ref>[http://www.westcoasteagles.com.au/TheClub/History/ClubRecords/ClubChampionAward19872006/tabid/7274/Default.aspx West Coast Eagles Club Champions]</ref>\n\nIn 1997, he suffered a knee injury, which required a [[knee reconstruction]] and this put him out of action for the rest of that season. In 1998, while he was attempting to regain form, Mainwaring  spent most of the season playing for the Sharks, before making his return to the West Coast side late that year. After another season in which he was in and out of the Eagles' side (and playing for East Fremantle), Mainwaring retired from AFL football.\n\nHe wore the Eagles' number 3 guernsey, a number which had only been worn by him and [[Chris Judd]] during the Eagles' history.

He played for the [[West Coast Eagles]] in the [[Australian Football League|Victorian Football League/Australian Football League]] (VFL/AFL) and [[East Fremantle Football Club|East Fremantle]] in the [[West Australian Football League]] (WAFL). He was also a [[television presenter]] and [[sports journalist]] with [[TVW#Seven News|Seven News Perth]] and a [[radio presenter]] with [[Mix 94.5]].\n\n==Football career==\nMainwaring started his career with the Greenough Demons (Rovers) before being recruited by East Fremantle \"The Sharks\" in 1985. In his first season, he was a member of the [[Western Australia]]n [[Interstate matches in Australian rules football|State of Origin]] team and played in a Sharks premiership team.\n\nHe was a member of the West Coast Eagles' inaugural squad in 1987. He made his debut in round three that year, against [[Sydney Swans|Sydney]] at [[Subiaco Oval|Subiaco]] and afterwards only missed one game for the season.<ref>[http://stats.afl.com.au/public/statistics/player_roundbyround/1987/13/player_roundbyround_13_1987.shtml?club_idIndex=16&season_idIndex=20 AFL 1987 Stats] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930061638/http://stats.afl.com.au/public/statistics/player_roundbyround/1987/13/player_roundbyround_13_1987.shtml?club_idIndex=16&season_idIndex=20 |date=30 September 2007 }}</ref> and was named their best first year player.<ref>[http://www.westcoasteagles.com.au/Eagles/TheClub/History/HonourRoll/tabid/7271/Default.aspx West Coast Eagles Honour Roll]</ref> Mainwaring played for the Eagles on the [[Football (Australian rules) positions#Midfield|wing]] and contributed greatly to their success, playing in both their 1992 and 1994 premierships. The image of him leaping with joy at the conclusion of the game, despite having a broken ankle, is one of the lasting images of the Eagles' first premiership. He played 201 games for the Eagles between 1987 and 1999, kicking 84 goals. \n\nMainwaring was an [[All-Australian Team|All-Australian]] in 1991 and 1996 and has been named on the wing in the West Coast Eagles' [[West Coast Eagles#Team of the Decade|Team of the Decade]] in 1996, [[West Coast Eagles#Team 20|Team20]] in 2006 and East Fremantle's Team of the Century in 1997. Whilst he never won the [[best and fairest|Club Champion]] award at the Eagles, he finished in the top 10 eight times, including placing third in both his debut and second years in the VFL and second in 1989, 1992 and 1996.<ref>[http://www.westcoasteagles.com.au/TheClub/History/ClubRecords/ClubChampionAward19872006/tabid/7274/Default.aspx West Coast Eagles Club Champions]</ref>\n\nIn 1997, he suffered a knee injury, which required a [[knee reconstruction]] and this put him out of action for the rest of that season. In 1998, while he was attempting to regain form, Mainwaring  spent most of the season playing for the Sharks, before making his return to the West Coast side late that year. After another season in which he was in and out of the Eagles' side (and playing for East Fremantle), Mainwaring retired from AFL football.\n\nHe wore the Eagles' number 3 guernsey, a number which had only been worn by him and [[Chris Judd]] during the Eagles' history. The club retired the number for the following three seasons, until it was revived by Eagles' draft pick [[Andrew Gaff]] in 2011.\n\nMainwaring played another season for the Sharks in 2000, after which he retired.\n\nAfter leaving football, Mainwaring took a job with Seven News.

The documentary followed them in the year after they had finished second in ''The X Factor'', capturing them as they toured with [[Lemar]], released their singles and attended the [[MOBO Awards]] amongst other highlights. The second show was an hour-long entertainment show for [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] titled ''This Is JLS'', which first aired on 11 December 2010 before the first show of that year's ''[[The X Factor (UK series 7)|X Factor]]'' final.

When he was 12, his mother was diagnosed with [[multiple sclerosis]].{{citation needed|date=June 2012}} He had to care for his brothers and sister whilst attending schools and clubs. He attended the British International School in [[Lagos]], Nigeria. Here he befriended English/Nigerian singer L Marshall (who also attended the school in Lagos) and won his first talent show performing alongside L in his final year. He also attended Larmenier Sacred Heart Catholic Primary School and Cardinal Vaughan Memorial School.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}} Williams dreamed of being a solo artist from a very young age. He was recruited for many boy bands but believed that a good boy band had to have a good bond between the members. He decided to put together his own boy band, UFO, who later changed their name to JLS (there was another British rock band already called UFO). He also wrote the song \"[[Wow Oh Wow]]\" for [[Jedward]]. \n\nOn 28 September 2013, Williams won the first series of the [[ITV (TV channel)|ITV]] dancing show ''[[Stepping Out (UK TV series)|Stepping Out]]'', hosted by [[Davina McCall]]. \n\nWilliams released his debut single \"Waterline\" featuring [[Pusha T]] in June 2015.\n\nHe was accused of rape in December 2016,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/news/celebs-tv/jls-rape-charge-oritse-williams-2003525|title=What we know so far about JLS star Oritse Williams' rape charge|first=Daniel|last=Chipperfield|date=9 October 2018|publisher=}}</ref> but was in May 2019 found not guilty.\n\n===Marvin Humes===\n{{Main|Marvin Humes}}\n'''Marvin Richard James Humes''' (born 18 March 1985 in [[Greenwich]], London, England) is the oldest member of the band.

Gill spent the first five years of his life living in [[Antigua]], discovering his musical talent at a very early age. After completing his exams at university, he decided to audition for ''The X Factor'' in 2008. It was at this point that he came into contact with the other members of JLS. Gill grew up, mostly, in [[Croydon]] and began making music at the age of seven when he played the recorder, piano, flute and guitar. At the age of nine, he joined the choir and went on to perform at the local church. Gill concentrated on his music and began studying at The [[Centre for Young Musicians]] (CYM).<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.jlsofficial.com/gb/biography/jls/ | title = JLS - All the latest official news - JLS | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120513120339/http://www.jlsofficial.com/gb/biography/jls/ | archivedate = 13 May 2012 | df = dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nAfter leaving the CYM, Gill stayed involved with the school music scene. He was involved with the choir at school. He continued this until he was 15 but had to give it up due to the pressures from the school to concentrate on his rugby career; he was involved with [[London Irish]] rugby club until he was 18. Gill eventually decided that he wanted to sing rather than play rugby and melon took up [[vocal coach]]ing during a year out before attending university. During this period, Gill was contacted by Oritse to try out for the band because of his musical ear and attention to harmonies. He studied theology at [[King's College London]], staying in halls in Russell Square, before dropping out to pursue a music career.\n\nIn December 2012, he won [[Strictly Come Dancing Christmas Specials#2012|the Christmas Special edition]] of the BBC program ''[[Strictly Come Dancing]]'', performing the Jive with [[Ola Jordan]].<ref>{{Cite web | title = Christmas Special 2012, Series 10, Strictly Come Dancing - BBC One | url = https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b01pkjn5 | publisher = BBC | accessdate = 2015-12-21 | date = 25 December 2012}}</ref> Gill is now an owner of a farm in Scotland and he will take a pause from music and start a different life as a farmer.<ref>{{cite news | title = 'JLS' JB Gill To Focus on Farming in the Wake of Band's Split Announcement' | url = http://www.capitalfm.com/artists/jls/news/jb-gill-farming-break-up/ | accessdate = 17 November 2013 | newspaper = Capital FM | date = 25 April 2013}}</ref>\n\nIn January 2014, it was revealed that JB would team up with DJ and music producer Charlie Hedges to release his debut solo single \"Best Night of My Life\", making him the first member of JLS to release solo material.\n\nIn late 2008, Gill began dating backing dancer Chloe Tangney. In January 2014, the couple announced their engagement and married on 3 May 2014. On 19 September 2014, the couple welcomed a baby boy, Ace Jeremiah Gill.

The documentary followed them in the year after they had finished second in ''The X Factor'', capturing them as they toured with [[Lemar]], released their singles and attended the [[MOBO Awards]] amongst other highlights. The second show was an hour-long entertainment show for [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] titled ''This Is JLS'', which first aired on 11 December 2010 before the first show of that year's ''[[The X Factor (UK series 7)|X Factor]]'' final.

He also attended Larmenier Sacred Heart Catholic Primary School and Cardinal Vaughan Memorial School.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}} Williams dreamed of being a solo artist from a very young age. He was recruited for many boy bands but believed that a good boy band had to have a good bond between the members. He decided to put together his own boy band, UFO, who later changed their name to JLS (there was another British rock band already called UFO). He also wrote the song \"[[Wow Oh Wow]]\" for [[Jedward]]. \n\nOn 28 September 2013, Williams won the first series of the [[ITV (TV channel)|ITV]] dancing show ''[[Stepping Out (UK TV series)|Stepping Out]]'', hosted by [[Davina McCall]]. \n\nWilliams released his debut single \"Waterline\" featuring [[Pusha T]] in June 2015.\n\nHe was accused of rape in December 2016,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/news/celebs-tv/jls-rape-charge-oritse-williams-2003525|title=What we know so far about JLS star Oritse Williams' rape charge|first=Daniel|last=Chipperfield|date=9 October 2018|publisher=}}</ref> but was in May 2019 found not guilty.\n\n===Marvin Humes===\n{{Main|Marvin Humes}}\n'''Marvin Richard James Humes''' (born 18 March 1985 in [[Greenwich]], London, England) is the oldest member of the band.

Gill spent the first five years of his life living in [[Antigua]], discovering his musical talent at a very early age. After completing his exams at university, he decided to audition for ''The X Factor'' in 2008. It was at this point that he came into contact with the other members of JLS. Gill grew up, mostly, in [[Croydon]] and began making music at the age of seven when he played the recorder, piano, flute and guitar. At the age of nine, he joined the choir and went on to perform at the local church. Gill concentrated on his music and began studying at The [[Centre for Young Musicians]] (CYM).<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.jlsofficial.com/gb/biography/jls/ | title = JLS - All the latest official news - JLS | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120513120339/http://www.jlsofficial.com/gb/biography/jls/ | archivedate = 13 May 2012 | df = dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nAfter leaving the CYM, Gill stayed involved with the school music scene. He was involved with the choir at school. He continued this until he was 15 but had to give it up due to the pressures from the school to concentrate on his rugby career; he was involved with [[London Irish]] rugby club until he was 18. Gill eventually decided that he wanted to sing rather than play rugby and melon took up [[vocal coach]]ing during a year out before attending university. During this period, Gill was contacted by Oritse to try out for the band because of his musical ear and attention to harmonies. He studied theology at [[King's College London]], staying in halls in Russell Square, before dropping out to pursue a music career.\n\nIn December 2012, he won [[Strictly Come Dancing Christmas Specials#2012|the Christmas Special edition]] of the BBC program ''[[Strictly Come Dancing]]'', performing the Jive with [[Ola Jordan]].<ref>{{Cite web | title = Christmas Special 2012, Series 10, Strictly Come Dancing - BBC One | url = https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b01pkjn5 | publisher = BBC | accessdate = 2015-12-21 | date = 25 December 2012}}</ref> Gill is now an owner of a farm in Scotland and he will take a pause from music and start a different life as a farmer.<ref>{{cite news | title = 'JLS' JB Gill To Focus on Farming in the Wake of Band's Split Announcement' | url = http://www.capitalfm.com/artists/jls/news/jb-gill-farming-break-up/ | accessdate = 17 November 2013 | newspaper = Capital FM | date = 25 April 2013}}</ref>\n\nIn January 2014, it was revealed that JB would team up with DJ and music producer Charlie Hedges to release his debut solo single \"Best Night of My Life\", making him the first member of JLS to release solo material.\n\nIn late 2008, Gill began dating backing dancer Chloe Tangney.

He debuted for them in 1919 and became Kiwi number 125<ref>{{cite news\n| title = Kiwis Roll of Honour\n| publisher = New Zealand Rugby League\n| url =https://nzrl.co.nz/kiwis-home/past-kiwis/\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>. He played his club rugby league for the [[Grafton Athletic]] and [[Newton Rangers]] teams in the [[Auckland Rugby League]] competition. He later moved to [[Tauranga]] and played for Tauranga and [[Bay of Plenty Steamers|Bay of Plenty]] at rugby union including against the touring [[Springbok national rugby union team|Springbok]] team in 1921. In 1922 he made an effort to establish Rugby League in the Tauranga area which failed however he did play matches for Tauranga and a Bay of Plenty league team who played against Auckland and the touring [[New South Wales rugby league team|New South Wales]] team.\n\n==Early Life==\nGeorge Iles grew up in [[Christchurch]]. He was the son of Harriet and Albert Iles, whose parents had come to New Zealand in one of the first \u201cfour ships\u201d which brought settlers to [[Canterbury, New Zealand|Canterbury]]<ref>{{cite news\n| title = Obituary/Mr Albert Iles\n| page = 2\n| publisher = Bay of Plenty Times, Volume LV, Issue 9359\n| date = 1926-12-09\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/BOPT19261209.2.9\n| accessdate = 2020-04-09}}</ref>.\nAlbert was a successful sportsman in his own right captaining the Sydenham Football Club in the 1880s and representing [[Canterbury Rugby Football Union|Canterbury]] and [[Rugby Southland|Southland]] for several years. He was also a champion runner. In 1912 the family moved to [[Auckland]] where they lived until 1919 and it was during these years that George made a name for himself as a rugby league player.\n\n==Rugby League and Rugby Union Playing Career==\n===Auckland and New Zealand Rugby League===\nGeorge Iles began his playing career for [[Grafton Athletic]] with his name first appearing in a team list for their second grade team in 1914 along with his brother Arthur Iles <ref>{{cite news\n| title = Under League Rules/Fixtures and Teams/Grafton Club\n| page = 10\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LI, Issue 15621\n| date = 1914-05-29\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19140529.2.132.1\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>. The following season he debuted for the Grafton senior team and played in the [[1915 Auckland Rugby League season|Auckland first grade competition]]. He was fortunate to play alongside the likes of New Zealand rugby league legends [[Karl Ifwersen]] and [[Dougie McGregor]], the later having already played for the [[New Zealand national rugby union team|All Blacks]] rugby team<ref>{{cite news\n| title = The League Game Notes and Comments\n| page = 10\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LII, Issue 15915\n| date = 1915-05-12\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19150512.2.124.1\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>. Grafton were to win the Auckland title [[1915 Auckland Rugby League season|this season]].\n\nBoth George and Arthur were to transfer to the [[Newton Rangers]] team for the [[1916 Auckland Rugby League season|1916 season]]. Newton struggled and finished last however Iles did score 7 out of Newton\u2019s 20 tries making him the second highest try scorer for the entire competition. The following year he went even better scoring 12 tries and leading the try scorer lists in the [[1917 Auckland Rugby League season|1917 competition]].\n\nIn 1918 Iles scored 4 tries for Newton and was also elected secretary of the club at their annual meeting<ref>{{cite news\n| title = Newton Rangers Club\n| page = 7\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LV, Issue 16814\n| date = 1918-04-03\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19180403.2.60\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>. He gained his first representative jersey when he was selected for the [[Auckland rugby league team|Auckland]] team for, at that time, a very rare representative fixture. During the war years the [[Auckland Rugby League]] had deliberately played almost no representative matches. The match was against [[Canterbury rugby league team|Canterbury]] and played at the [[Auckland Domain]] in front of 10,000 spectators. Auckland won 45-9 with Iles scoring a try in the corner \u201cafter a cross-field run\u201d <ref>{{cite news\n| title =Auckland Defeats Canterbury/Forty-Five Points to Nine\n| page =3\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LV, Issue 16956\n| date = 1918-09-16\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19180916.2.15.1\n| accessdate = 2019-08-10}}</ref>.\n\nOnce again in [[1919 Auckland Rugby League season|1919]] Iles was a prolific try scorer for Newton notching 10 tries in total including tries in the Roope Rooster semi final against [[Ponsonby Ponies|Ponsonby United]], and the semi final replay against the same opponents when the first match was abandoned near the end after Ponsonby fans encroached on the field and refused to move. Newton went on to win the Roope Rooster for the first time in their clubs history<ref>{{cite news\n| title =Roope Rooster Competition/Final Won by Newton/Game Played in Downpour\n| page =4\n| publisher =New Zealand Herald, Volume LVI, Issue 17253\n| date = 1919-09-01\n| url = https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19190901.2.9.1\n| accessdate = 2019-08-20}}</ref>. \n\nIles was picked to play for Auckland against New Zealand on May 24. It was the first of 3 games he would play for them this season. The match was a warmup for the Australian Tour for the New Zealand side and was won by New Zealand 25-19 in front of 8,000 spectators at the [[Auckland Domain]] <ref>{{cite news\n| title =New Zealand Beats Auckland/Keenly Contested Game\n| page =9\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LVI, Issue 17170\n| date = 1919-05-26\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19190526.2.105.1\n| accessdate = 2019-08-10}}</ref>. His next appearance was against the Returned Soldiers team as part of the Peace Day celebration program. It was held at the Auckland Domain on July 20 and featured athletics, rugby union, rugby league, football, and hockey matches. The Returned Soldiers team won 26-24 with Iles scoring two second half tries for the losing Auckland team<ref>{{cite news\n| title =Northern Union Grade\n| page =9\n| publisher = Auckland Star, Volume L, Issue 172\n| date = 1919-07-22\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/AS19190722.2.130\n| accessdate = 2019-08-10}}</ref>. His last ever match in an Auckland jersey was played against [[Rugby League Hawkes Bay|Hawke\u2019s Bay]] at [[Eden Park]] on August 9 with 9,000 watching on. Iles scored two more tries. The first after receiving a pass from [[Bert Laing]] and \u201ccutting in neatly and scoring\u201d, while his second saw him picking up the ball in the open \u201coutpacing the opposition and swerving past McCarthy [to score] a good try\u201d<ref>{{cite news\n| title =Representative Match/Auckland V Hawke\u2019s Bay\n| page =9\n| publisher =New Zealand Herald, Volume LVI, Issue 17235\n| date = 1911-08-11\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19190811.2.111.1\n| accessdate = 2019-08-18}}</ref>.\n\nIles was to make his [[New Zealand national rugby league team|New Zealand]] debut two weeks later. He played all of his 4 matches for New Zealand in 4 consecutive weekends. New Zealand had sent a touring team to [[Australia]] where they had played 11 matches against various teams but no tests<ref>{{cite news\n| title = All Blacks Tour 1919\n| publisher = Rugby League Project\n| url = https://www.rugbyleagueproject.org/competitions/all-blacks-tour-1919/summary.html\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>. After this tour they returned home and [[Australia national rugby league team|Australia]] sent a touring team to New Zealand<ref>{{cite news\n| title = Kangaroos Tour 1919\n| publisher = Rugby League Project\n| url = https://www.rugbyleagueproject.org/competitions/kangaroos-tour-1919/summary.html\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>. Iles had played in a trial on May 14 to make the tour but was not selected.\n\nOn August 23 he played his first test for New Zealand at the [[Basin Reserve]] in [[Wellington]] and went down 21-44 in front of 8,000 spectators<ref>{{cite news\n| title = League Football/Australia V New Zealand\n| page = 7\n| publisher = Dominion, Volume 12, Issue 282\n| date = 1919-08-25\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/DOM19190825.2.88\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>. Iles had a happier time of it in the second test which New Zealand won at Sydenham Park in [[Christchurch]]. Iles scored a try which was described \u201cfollowing an exchange of kicks between the two full-backs the New Zealanders swept down in a line and Iles got over\u201d, this made the score 21-2 to New Zealand. They would go on to win 26-10 in front of 6,000<ref>{{cite news\n| title = The League Game/Australia v New Zealand/Visitors Outclassed\n| page = 7\n| publisher = Dominion, Volume 12, Issue 288\n| date = 1919-09-01\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/DOM19190901.2.78\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>.

Iles was listed to play in the reserves a week later for the Auckland team to play Australia but he did not take the field in an 8-32 loss.\n\n===Move to Tauranga and Switch to Rugby Union===\nIn 1920 George Iles moved to Tauranga with his family. There because rugby league was barely played he largely played rugby union over the following decade for Tauranga and the [[Bay of Plenty Steamers|Bay of Plenty]] representative team. In July 1920 he played for Tauranga against Grammar Old Boys. It was said \u201cof the Tauranga team the Isles [sic] brothers, three quarters, played well, and if supported by other members of the back division, would have made things a bit more awkward for the visitors. They both handled the ball well\u201d <ref>{{cite news\n| title = Grammar Old Boys v Tauranga\n| page = 8\n| publisher = Observer, Volume XL, Issue 45\n| date = 1920-07-10\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/TO19200710.2.13.1\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>. In a bizarre situation Iles played for Auckland against his own Bay of Plenty union in a match on 31 July when an Auckland back was unable to make the trip to Tauranga and Iles was asked to take his place. Bay of Plenty won 17-10 but Iles played brilliantly and comment was made that he shouldn't have been left out of the Bay team in the first place\n<ref>{{cite news\n| title =Bay of Plenty Footballers Defeat Auckland Representatives\n| page =3\n| publisher =Bay of Plenty Times, Volume XLVIII, Issue 7464, 2 August 1920, Page 3\n| date = 1920-08-02\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/BOPT19200802.2.9\n| accessdate = 2020-04-10}}</ref>.

His debut season in the code continued to be an impressive one.

The match was played at [[Rotorua]] with 5,000 spectators present to witness the Springboks win by 17 points to 9. Iles helped set up the first try to David Werahiko Borell after he initiated a \u201cnice attack\u201d and he did the same for their second and final try when Montgomery \u201csent the ball across to Iles who opened up splendidly, and the ball came across to Borell, who scored near the corner\u201d <ref>{{cite news\n| title = Springboks Beat Bay of Plenty\n| page = 3\n| publisher = Bay of Plenty Times, Volume 49, Issue 7781\n| date = 1921-08-25\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/BOPT19210825.2.13\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>.\n\n===Effort to Introduce Rugby League to Tauranga===\nDespite these fine rugby achievements it appears that Iles had not forgotten his rugby league background. He was part of an effort to establish rugby league in the [[Tauranga]] area in 1922. The Tauranga Rugby League was started and they looked to play rugby league teams from other areas. The league was officially formed in March, 1922 <ref>{{cite news| title = Under League Rules/Decisions of Executive\n| page = 3\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LIX, Issue 18053, 30 March 1922, Page 3\n| date = 1922-03-30\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19220330.2.16.8\n| accessdate = 2020-04-10}}</ref>. They made efforts to organise a game with the newly formed Rotorua league team<ref>{{cite news\n| title = Local and General\n| page = 2\n| publisher = Bay of Plenty Times, Volume LI, Issue 8079\n| date = 1922-09-02\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/BOPT19220902.2.4\n| accessdate = 2020-04-10}}</ref>. On April 12 he wrote a letter to the [[Bay of Plenty Times]] about the strength of the rugby league code in various places and was writing in response to a query about why rugby league had been started in the area by Mr. Phelan, a past member of the Tauranga rugby selection committee. Iles responded in a lengthy letter \u201cthe answer is the same as that to why the League game was first commenced \u2013 that is dissatisfaction with Rugby management\u201d, he went on to say \u201ctouching on the standard of play in League, as one who has played both codes I give it as my opinion that League is played on a far higher standard in [[Australia]] and [[Auckland]] than Rugby\u201d <ref>{{cite news\n| title = Public Opinion/Rival Codes\n| page = 4\n| publisher = Bay of Plenty Times, Volume L, Issue 7961\n| date = 1922-04-13\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/BOPT19220413.2.27\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>.

Tauranga took on the Rotorua team on the Tauranga Domain. As well as George Iles playing, David Borell and Arthur Iles also played in the match. Rotorua won a high scoring match 29-28 with both Iles and Borell scoring tries\n<ref>{{cite news\n| title =Rotorua Wins by One Point\n| page =4\n| publisher =Bay of Plenty Times, Volume LI, Issue 8092\n| date = 1922-09-18\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/BOPT19220918.2.24\n| accessdate = 2020-04-10}}</ref>.\n\nA game against the touring [[New South Wales rugby league team|New South Wales]] was also arranged which was a remarkable achievement in itself given that rugby league was not even played in the area until a month earlier. The match was between New South Wales and Bay of Plenty. George Iles naturally played and the team also featured future Kiwi [[George Gardiner (rugby league)|George Gardiner]] while the visiting NSW team featured the likes of [[Frank Burge]] and [[Reg Latta]]. New South Wales won the match 29 points to 5 with Borell scoring a try and Joseph Rogers kicking a goal for the local team\n<ref>{{cite news\n| title =Kangaroos 29 Bay of Plenty 5\n| page =4\n| publisher =Bay of Plenty Times, Volume LI, Issue 8101\n| date = 1922-09-28\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/BOPT19220928.2.33\n| accessdate = 2020-04-11}}</ref>.\n\nOn September 30 Tauranga again made history by playing in the first ever rugby league game in [[Te Puke]] <ref>{{cite news\n| title = Local and General\n| page = 2\n| publisher = Bay of Plenty Times, Volume LI, Issue 8102\n| date = 1922-09-29\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/BOPT19220929.2.3\n| accessdate = 2020-04-10}}</ref>. Efforts were then made to arrange a match with an Auckland team and this eventuated with Auckland sending a very strong team down to play in Tauranga on October 7. It wasn\u2019t a Tauranga side who took on Auckland rather a Bay of Plenty team with players from throughout the district. George Iles captained the Bay of Plenty side and they performed well only going down 27-33 to an Auckland team which featured a large number of New Zealand international players such as [[Clarrie Polson]], [[Wally Somers]], and future Kiwi\u2019s [[Lou Brown (rugby league)|Lou Brown]], [[Neville St George]], and [[James Lawrence O\u2019Brien|Jim Brown]].<ref>{{cite news\n| title =Auckland League Team in Tauranga/Match Against Bay of Plenty\n| page = 3\n| work = Bay of Plenty Times| volume=LI| issue=8109\n| date = 1922-10-07\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/BOPT19221007.2.15\n| accessdate = 2020-03-11}}</ref>. Iles scored a try against his former team.\n\nIn September Iles went on the attack again, this time in response to the suggestion by rugby supporters that league players were being paid. He was writing as a member of Tauranga Rugby League and challenged \u201cany member of the Rugby Union to produce evidence of proof of any monetary benefits received by players or officers of the Tauranga Rugby League. If this can be done I will donate \u00a350 to any charity benefit. <ref>{{cite news\n| title = Football Matters\n| page = 2\n| publisher = Bay of Plenty Times, Volume LI, Issue 8102\n| date = 1922-09-29\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/BOPT19220929.2.5.1\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>.

These efforts to grow the game in the area, while somewhat remarkable, ultimately proved futile and Iles returned to the rugby union field the following season.\n\n===Back to Rugby Union===\nIn 1923 he played for Tauranga rugby team against Te Puke in [[Te Puke]] and then again in the return match in [[Tauranga]].

They then beat Whakatane in the semi final.

He debuted for them in 1919 and became Kiwi number 125<ref>{{cite news\n| title = Kiwis Roll of Honour\n| publisher = New Zealand Rugby League\n| url =https://nzrl.co.nz/kiwis-home/past-kiwis/\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>. He played his club rugby league for the [[Grafton Athletic]] and [[Newton Rangers]] teams in the [[Auckland Rugby League]] competition. He later moved to [[Tauranga]] and played for Tauranga and [[Bay of Plenty Steamers|Bay of Plenty]] at rugby union including against the touring [[Springbok national rugby union team|Springbok]] team in 1921. In 1922 he made an effort to establish Rugby League in the Tauranga area which failed however he did play matches for Tauranga and a Bay of Plenty league team who played against Auckland and the touring [[New South Wales rugby league team|New South Wales]] team.\n\n==Early Life==\nGeorge Iles grew up in [[Christchurch]]. He was the son of Harriet and Albert Iles, whose parents had come to New Zealand in one of the first \u201cfour ships\u201d which brought settlers to [[Canterbury, New Zealand|Canterbury]]<ref>{{cite news\n| title = Obituary/Mr Albert Iles\n| page = 2\n| publisher = Bay of Plenty Times, Volume LV, Issue 9359\n| date = 1926-12-09\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/BOPT19261209.2.9\n| accessdate = 2020-04-09}}</ref>.\nAlbert was a successful sportsman in his own right captaining the Sydenham Football Club in the 1880s and representing [[Canterbury Rugby Football Union|Canterbury]] and [[Rugby Southland|Southland]] for several years. He was also a champion runner. In 1912 the family moved to [[Auckland]] where they lived until 1919 and it was during these years that George made a name for himself as a rugby league player.\n\n==Rugby League and Rugby Union Playing Career==\n===Auckland and New Zealand Rugby League===\nGeorge Iles began his playing career for [[Grafton Athletic]] with his name first appearing in a team list for their second grade team in 1914 along with his brother Arthur Iles <ref>{{cite news\n| title = Under League Rules/Fixtures and Teams/Grafton Club\n| page = 10\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LI, Issue 15621\n| date = 1914-05-29\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19140529.2.132.1\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>. The following season he debuted for the Grafton senior team and played in the [[1915 Auckland Rugby League season|Auckland first grade competition]]. He was fortunate to play alongside the likes of New Zealand rugby league legends [[Karl Ifwersen]] and [[Dougie McGregor]], the later having already played for the [[New Zealand national rugby union team|All Blacks]] rugby team<ref>{{cite news\n| title = The League Game Notes and Comments\n| page = 10\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LII, Issue 15915\n| date = 1915-05-12\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19150512.2.124.1\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>. Grafton were to win the Auckland title [[1915 Auckland Rugby League season|this season]].\n\nBoth George and Arthur were to transfer to the [[Newton Rangers]] team for the [[1916 Auckland Rugby League season|1916 season]]. Newton struggled and finished last however Iles did score 7 out of Newton\u2019s 20 tries making him the second highest try scorer for the entire competition. The following year he went even better scoring 12 tries and leading the try scorer lists in the [[1917 Auckland Rugby League season|1917 competition]].\n\nIn 1918 Iles scored 4 tries for Newton and was also elected secretary of the club at their annual meeting<ref>{{cite news\n| title = Newton Rangers Club\n| page = 7\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LV, Issue 16814\n| date = 1918-04-03\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19180403.2.60\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>. He gained his first representative jersey when he was selected for the [[Auckland rugby league team|Auckland]] team for, at that time, a very rare representative fixture. During the war years the [[Auckland Rugby League]] had deliberately played almost no representative matches. The match was against [[Canterbury rugby league team|Canterbury]] and played at the [[Auckland Domain]] in front of 10,000 spectators. Auckland won 45-9 with Iles scoring a try in the corner \u201cafter a cross-field run\u201d <ref>{{cite news\n| title =Auckland Defeats Canterbury/Forty-Five Points to Nine\n| page =3\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LV, Issue 16956\n| date = 1918-09-16\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19180916.2.15.1\n| accessdate = 2019-08-10}}</ref>.\n\nOnce again in [[1919 Auckland Rugby League season|1919]] Iles was a prolific try scorer for Newton notching 10 tries in total including tries in the Roope Rooster semi final against [[Ponsonby Ponies|Ponsonby United]], and the semi final replay against the same opponents when the first match was abandoned near the end after Ponsonby fans encroached on the field and refused to move.

The first after receiving a pass from [[Bert Laing]] and \u201ccutting in neatly and scoring\u201d, while his second saw him picking up the ball in the open \u201coutpacing the opposition and swerving past McCarthy [to score] a good try\u201d<ref>{{cite news\n| title =Representative Match/Auckland V Hawke\u2019s Bay\n| page =9\n| publisher =New Zealand Herald, Volume LVI, Issue 17235\n| date = 1911-08-11\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19190811.2.111.1\n| accessdate = 2019-08-18}}</ref>.\n\nIles was to make his [[New Zealand national rugby league team|New Zealand]] debut two weeks later.

Iles was listed to play in the reserves a week later for the Auckland team to play Australia but he did not take the field in an 8-32 loss.\n\n===Move to Tauranga and Switch to Rugby Union===\nIn 1920 George Iles moved to Tauranga with his family. There because rugby league was barely played he largely played rugby union over the following decade for Tauranga and the [[Bay of Plenty Steamers|Bay of Plenty]] representative team. In July 1920 he played for Tauranga against Grammar Old Boys. It was said \u201cof the Tauranga team the Isles [sic] brothers, three quarters, played well, and if supported by other members of the back division, would have made things a bit more awkward for the visitors. They both handled the ball well\u201d <ref>{{cite news\n| title = Grammar Old Boys v Tauranga\n| page = 8\n| publisher = Observer, Volume XL, Issue 45\n| date = 1920-07-10\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/TO19200710.2.13.1\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>. In a bizarre situation Iles played for Auckland against his own Bay of Plenty union in a match on 31 July when an Auckland back was unable to make the trip to Tauranga and Iles was asked to take his place. Bay of Plenty won 17-10 but Iles played brilliantly and comment was made that he shouldn't have been left out of the Bay team in the first place\n<ref>{{cite news\n| title =Bay of Plenty Footballers Defeat Auckland Representatives\n| page =3\n| publisher =Bay of Plenty Times, Volume XLVIII, Issue 7464, 2 August 1920, Page 3\n| date = 1920-08-02\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/BOPT19200802.2.9\n| accessdate = 2020-04-10}}</ref>.

The match was played at [[Rotorua]] with 5,000 spectators present to witness the Springboks win by 17 points to 9. Iles helped set up the first try to David Werahiko Borell after he initiated a \u201cnice attack\u201d and he did the same for their second and final try when Montgomery \u201csent the ball across to Iles who opened up splendidly, and the ball came across to Borell, who scored near the corner\u201d <ref>{{cite news\n| title = Springboks Beat Bay of Plenty\n| page = 3\n| publisher = Bay of Plenty Times, Volume 49, Issue 7781\n| date = 1921-08-25\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/BOPT19210825.2.13\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>.\n\n===Effort to Introduce Rugby League to Tauranga===\nDespite these fine rugby achievements it appears that Iles had not forgotten his rugby league background. He was part of an effort to establish rugby league in the [[Tauranga]] area in 1922. The Tauranga Rugby League was started and they looked to play rugby league teams from other areas. The league was officially formed in March, 1922 <ref>{{cite news| title = Under League Rules/Decisions of Executive\n| page = 3\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LIX, Issue 18053, 30 March 1922, Page 3\n| date = 1922-03-30\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19220330.2.16.8\n| accessdate = 2020-04-10}}</ref>. They made efforts to organise a game with the newly formed Rotorua league team<ref>{{cite news\n| title = Local and General\n| page = 2\n| publisher = Bay of Plenty Times, Volume LI, Issue 8079\n| date = 1922-09-02\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/BOPT19220902.2.4\n| accessdate = 2020-04-10}}</ref>. On April 12 he wrote a letter to the [[Bay of Plenty Times]] about the strength of the rugby league code in various places and was writing in response to a query about why rugby league had been started in the area by Mr. Phelan, a past member of the Tauranga rugby selection committee. Iles responded in a lengthy letter \u201cthe answer is the same as that to why the League game was first commenced \u2013 that is dissatisfaction with Rugby management\u201d, he went on to say \u201ctouching on the standard of play in League, as one who has played both codes I give it as my opinion that League is played on a far higher standard in [[Australia]] and [[Auckland]] than Rugby\u201d <ref>{{cite news\n| title = Public Opinion/Rival Codes\n| page = 4\n| publisher = Bay of Plenty Times, Volume L, Issue 7961\n| date = 1922-04-13\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/BOPT19220413.2.27\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>. He was still playing rugby union through this period and played for Tauranga in a drawn match with Rangataua in June\n<ref>{{cite news\n| title =Rugby Union's Cup Matches Continued/Tauranga and Rangataua Play a Draw\n| page =2\n| publisher =Bay of Plenty Times, Volume L, Issue 8007\n| date = 1922-06-12\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/BOPT19220612.2.5\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>. On August 28 he wrote another letter suggesting a match between those players who had been selected for the Tauranga rugby union team and those who had not as there had evidently been some controversy over selections<ref>{{cite news\n| title = Football Challenge\n| page = 2\n| publisher = Bay of Plenty Times, Volume L, Issue 8075\n| date = 1922-08-29\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/BOPT19220829.2.5.1\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>.\n\nOn the 16th of September history was made in Tauranga with the first ever game of rugby keague played there. Tauranga took on the Rotorua team on the Tauranga Domain. As well as George Iles playing, David Borell and Arthur Iles also played in the match. Rotorua won a high scoring match 29-28 with both Iles and Borell scoring tries\n<ref>{{cite news\n| title =Rotorua Wins by One Point\n| page =4\n| publisher =Bay of Plenty Times, Volume LI, Issue 8092\n| date = 1922-09-18\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/BOPT19220918.2.24\n| accessdate = 2020-04-10}}</ref>.\n\nA game against the touring [[New South Wales rugby league team|New South Wales]] was also arranged which was a remarkable achievement in itself given that rugby league was not even played in the area until a month earlier. The match was between New South Wales and Bay of Plenty. George Iles naturally played and the team also featured future Kiwi [[George Gardiner (rugby league)|George Gardiner]] while the visiting NSW team featured the likes of [[Frank Burge]] and [[Reg Latta]]. New South Wales won the match 29 points to 5 with Borell scoring a try and Joseph Rogers kicking a goal for the local team\n<ref>{{cite news\n| title =Kangaroos 29 Bay of Plenty 5\n| page =4\n| publisher =Bay of Plenty Times, Volume LI, Issue 8101\n| date = 1922-09-28\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/BOPT19220928.2.33\n| accessdate = 2020-04-11}}</ref>.\n\nOn September 30 Tauranga again made history by playing in the first ever rugby league game in [[Te Puke]] <ref>{{cite news\n| title = Local and General\n| page = 2\n| publisher = Bay of Plenty Times, Volume LI, Issue 8102\n| date = 1922-09-29\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/BOPT19220929.2.3\n| accessdate = 2020-04-10}}</ref>. Efforts were then made to arrange a match with an Auckland team and this eventuated with Auckland sending a very strong team down to play in Tauranga on October 7. It wasn\u2019t a Tauranga side who took on Auckland rather a Bay of Plenty team with players from throughout the district. George Iles captained the Bay of Plenty side and they performed well only going down 27-33 to an Auckland team which featured a large number of New Zealand international players such as [[Clarrie Polson]], [[Wally Somers]], and future Kiwi\u2019s [[Lou Brown (rugby league)|Lou Brown]], [[Neville St George]], and [[James Lawrence O\u2019Brien|Jim Brown]].<ref>{{cite news\n| title =Auckland League Team in Tauranga/Match Against Bay of Plenty\n| page = 3\n| work = Bay of Plenty Times| volume=LI| issue=8109\n| date = 1922-10-07\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/BOPT19221007.2.15\n| accessdate = 2020-03-11}}</ref>. Iles scored a try against his former team.\n\nIn September Iles went on the attack again, this time in response to the suggestion by rugby supporters that league players were being paid. He was writing as a member of Tauranga Rugby League and challenged \u201cany member of the Rugby Union to produce evidence of proof of any monetary benefits received by players or officers of the Tauranga Rugby League. If this can be done I will donate \u00a350 to any charity benefit. <ref>{{cite news\n| title = Football Matters\n| page = 2\n| publisher = Bay of Plenty Times, Volume LI, Issue 8102\n| date = 1922-09-29\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/BOPT19220929.2.5.1\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>. On October 14 Tauranga played a match on the Waihi Recreation Ground and lost 6-19 in front of a large attendance, Iles again leading the Tauranga team\n<ref>{{cite news\n| title =The Waihi-Tauranga League Match\n| page =2\n| publisher =Waihi Daily Telegraph, Volume XX, Issue 6741\n| date = 1922-10-16\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/WHDT19221016.2.23\n| accessdate = 2020-04-11}}</ref>. These efforts to grow the game in the area, while somewhat remarkable, ultimately proved futile and Iles returned to the rugby union field the following season.\n\n===Back to Rugby Union===\nIn 1923 he played for Tauranga rugby team against Te Puke in [[Te Puke]] and then again in the return match in [[Tauranga]]. He was also turning out for the Cadets Old Boys senior side in the club competition <ref>{{cite news\n| title =Rugby Football on Monday Next/Te Puke Representatives to Visit Tauranga\n| page =3\n| publisher =Bay of Plenty Times, Volume LI, Issue 8302\n| date = 1923-05-31\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/BOPT19230531.2.14\n| accessdate = 2020-04-10}}</ref>.

They then beat Whakatane in the semi final. On August 2 [[Karl Ifwersen]] brought down a team from Auckland from the Grammar Old Boys, College Rifles and Ponsonby clubs to play against a Tauranga XV captained by George Iles.

Due to Monica's poor parallel parking job, he misses his meeting, and despite Monica's apologies, he yells at her. Tess counsels Monica to forgive him then rather than harbor her own anger and take it out on someone else. Meanwhile, Andrew counsels Simon to meet his estranged son Russell at Flynn's restaurant. Later, while Tess and Monica each lunch at Flynn's, Monica, still in a foul mood drops Flynn's cell phone in the fish tank to cease its annoying beeping.

Mother Kate lives in the 19th century, running an antique shop and avoiding technology as much as possible. Father, Charlie, lives in the 20th century with his widescreen TV and microwave. But Sarah, their 13-year-old daughter, and Millie, their kindergartner, live in the 21st century, relying on the Internet to help them with their school projects. One night, while researching Hawaii, Sarah stumbles onto a pornographic website. Charlie and Kate insist that she turn it off immediately, upset that this sort of material is so easily accessible. At the antique store, Kate meets Monica and they become fast friends. Meanwhile, Tess avoids Millie's questions about reproduction suggesting that Mom and Dad will want to give her those answers. Kiki, Sarah's world-wise pal, takes her to the cyber caf\u00e9 run by Andrew. At work, Charlie's co-worker shows him some porn sites and Charlie is intrigued. And before he knows it, he has spent an hour surfing those sites. When his boss catches him, he is fired. Charlie tells Kate about being fired, but he lies, saying he was only on for a minute. Despite this, Kate insists on getting rid of the computer. Charlie offers it to Andrew, who rents it for the caf\u00e9. Charlie begins spending time there, preparing his resume. Sarah, furious that the computer is gone, spends time at Kiki's house surfing the web. They begin a chat with \"Dean16\" who sends them his picture, but as Sarah sends him her picture, we learn that he is actually much older. Tess brings Millie home from school and talks to Kate and Charlie about her questions. They agree to speak with her soon. When Kate talks to Monica about protecting her children from the Internet, Monica reminds her that it is more important to equip children with the tools they need to protect themselves. Meanwhile Sarah agrees to meet Dean face to face. Charlie admits his lie to Kate, telling her he cannot get the images out of his head. This further affects Kate's hatred of technology. Sarah meets Dean at the local park. At first, she is nervous that he is much older, but he sweet talks her into believing he is only 19, and she agrees to go back to his apartment. Monica and Andrew find Kate and Charlie, and reveal to them that they are angels, and tell them of the danger Sarah is in. At Dean's apartment, he slips some drugs into Sarah's drink, and becomes upset when she says she's not thirsty. As Dean moves to attack Sarah, Charlie and Andrew arrive. Dean attacks Andrew with a baseball bat, but is unable to stop him. In anger, Andrew smashes Dean's computer. Monica then delivers a message to the Radcliff family that they have been the victims of an evil force. She also tells them that the Internet is an exciting gift from God, but that like many of His gifts, it can be abused. That is why it is important to take precautions with the Internet. A few days later Sarah unveils a webpage for Kate's antique store, and Charlie decides to start his own business too: managing the cyber caf\u00e9. \n\n''Guest Stars'': [[Christine Estabrook]], [[Evan Rachel Wood]] and [[Gary Cole]]\n |LineColor       = 40E0D0\n}}\n}}\n</onlyinclude>\n\n==References==\n<references />\n\n==External links==\n* {{official website|http://touched.com}}\n* {{IMDb title|0108968|Touched by an Angel}}\n* {{tv.com show|touched-by-an-angel|Touched by an Angel}}\n* {{epguides|id=TouchedbyanAngel|title=Touched by an Angel}}\n\n{{Touched By An Angel Episodes}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Touched by an Angel (season 6)}}\n[[Category:Touched by an Angel seasons]]\n[[Category:1999 American television seasons]]\n[[Category:2000 American television seasons]]\n", "text_old": "{{Multiple issues|\n{{more citations needed|date=April 2010}}\n{{lead too short|date=April 2010}}\n}}\n{{Infobox television season\n| season_number        = 6\n| bgcolour             = #40E0D0\n| image                = Touched by an Angel Season 6.jpg\n| image_upright        = \n| image_size           = \n| image_alt            = \n| caption              = \n| starring             = {{ubl|[[Roma Downey]]|[[Della Reese]]|[[John Dye]]}}\n| country              = United States\n| num_episodes         = 26\n| network              = [[CBS]]\n| first_aired          = {{Start date|1999|9|26}}\n| last_aired           = {{End date|2000|5|21}}\n| episode_list         = List of Touched by an Angel episodes\n}}\nThe sixth season of the American dramatic television series ''[[Touched by an Angel]]'' aired [[CBS]] from September 26, 1999 through May 21, 2000, spanning 26 episodes.

Monica reminds Flynn that it was something he did earlier in the day that led to this desperate situation. Earlier that morning, Flynn rushed to the Bank to appeal a foreclosure on his restaurant. Due to Monica's poor parallel parking job, he misses his meeting, and despite Monica's apologies, he yells at her. Tess counsels Monica to forgive him then rather than harbor her own anger and take it out on someone else. Meanwhile, Andrew counsels Simon to meet his estranged son Russell at Flynn's restaurant. Later, while Tess and Monica each lunch at Flynn's, Monica, still in a foul mood drops Flynn's cell phone in the fish tank to cease its annoying beeping.

Ultimately the bank loan officer visits the restaurant and finds the customers and staff to be so unfriendly, he refuses to reverse the foreclosure.

And before he knows it, he has spent an hour surfing those sites. When his boss catches him, he is fired. Charlie tells Kate about being fired, but he lies, saying he was only on for a minute. Despite this, Kate insists on getting rid of the computer. Charlie offers it to Andrew, who rents it for the caf\u00e9. Charlie begins spending time there, preparing his resume. Sarah, furious that the computer is gone, spends time at Kiki's house surfing the web. They begin a chat with \"Dean16\" who sends them his picture, but as Sarah sends him her picture, we learn that he is actually much older. Tess brings Millie home from school and talks to Kate and Charlie about her questions. They agree to speak with her soon. When Kate talks to Monica about protecting her children from the Internet, Monica reminds her that it is more important to equip children with the tools they need to protect themselves. Meanwhile Sarah agrees to meet Dean face to face. Charlie admits his lie to Kate, telling her he cannot get the images out of his head. This further affects Kate's hatred of technology. Sarah meets Dean at the local park. At first, she is nervous that he is much older, but he sweet talks her into believing he is only 19, and she agrees to go back to his apartment. Monica and Andrew find Kate and Charlie, and reveal to them that they are angels, and tell them of the danger Sarah is in. At Dean's apartment, he slips some drugs into Sarah's drink, and becomes upset when she says she's not thirsty. As Dean moves to attack Sarah, Charlie and Andrew arrive. Dean attacks Andrew with a baseball bat, but is unable to stop him. In anger, Andrew smashes Dean's computer. Monica then delivers a message to the Radcliff family that they have been the victims of an evil force. She also tells them that the Internet is an exciting gift from God, but that like many of His gifts, it can be abused. That is why it is important to take precautions with the Internet. A few days later Sarah unveils a webpage for Kate's antique store, and Charlie decides to start his own business too: managing the cyber caf\u00e9. \n\n''Guest Stars'': [[Christine Estabrook]], [[Evan Rachel Wood]] and [[Gary Cole]]\n |LineColor       = 40E0D0\n}}\n}}\n</onlyinclude>\n\n==References==\n<references />\n\n==External links==\n* {{official website|http://touched.com}}\n* {{IMDb title|0108968|Touched by an Angel}}\n* {{tv.com show|touched-by-an-angel|Touched by an Angel}}\n* {{epguides|id=TouchedbyanAngel|title=Touched by an Angel}}\n\n{{Touched By An Angel Episodes}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Touched by an Angel (season 6)}}\n[[Category:Touched by an Angel seasons]]\n[[Category:1999 American television seasons]]\n[[Category:2000 American television seasons]]\n", "name_user": "LilHelpa", "label": "safe", "comment": "typo: though\u2192through; mos", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touched_by_an_Angel_(season_6)"}
