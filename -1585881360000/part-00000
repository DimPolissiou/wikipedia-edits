In the case of Trumau it could mean the end of the meadowlands.\nIn ancient documents, Trumau appears in the following versions: between 1137-1340: Trumowe, 1139 Drumau, 1178 Drumawe, between 1233 and 1294 Drumowe, between 1303 and 1306 Drumbuowe, 1340 Drumenaw, 1380 Drumpnaw, 1388 Drumpnow, 1463 Thrumbaw. Rumor has it that it was often referred to as \u201a drum\u00f0o\u2019 among the inhabitants.\n\n==Population==\n{{Historical populations\n|align=left\n|1971|1880\n|1981|1933\n|1991|2199\n|2001|2507\n|2011|3332\n}}\n\n==Culture and Sights==\n\n===Parish church===\nFor more than 840 years, there has been a connection between the parish church of Trumau and the Zisterzienser monastery. \nIn the course of the counter-reformation, under the reign of the [[Habsburgs]], many parishes were founded. The emperor [[Rudolph II]] as well as bishop Urban, got the approval of Abbot Udalrich Molitor to build the parish church of Trumau in 1583. They agreed on the patronage one year later. At this time the parish of Trumau was under the control of the parish [[Traiskirchen]], which was incorporated with the monastery [[Melk]]. The abbot of Heiligenkreuz arranged the construction of the church, which was then verifiably built by the master-builder \"Maister Andre Stuber zu Paden\". The work of the chisellers was carried out by the Italian brothers Elias and Alexius Payos, who were masters in this kind of work, from monastery\u2019s own delf. The church was finished under Abbot Johannes Ruoff, and it was inaugurated by bishop Hector von Passau on February, 22nd 1588. [[John the Baptist]] is its patron saint.\n\n===Castle===\nThe [[castle]] of Trumau is a moated castle in Trumau in [[Lower Austria]]. From the beginning it has been in the ownership of the Zisterzienserstift Heiligenkreuz. The castle was a present from the Babenberg\u2019s [[Margrave]] [[Leopold IV, Duke of Bavaria|Leopold IV]]. in 1138. \nIn the 12th century, a grange was built by the Zisterzienser at the place where the castle is standing nowadays. At that time there has also probably been a water ditch, an overflow spillway and a mill with a mill stream. The Zisterziensers practiced agriculture, viniculture and sheep-breeding there. \nTowards the end of the 1st Austrian [[Ottoman wars in Europe|T\u00fcrkenkrieg]] the courtyard was rebuilt from 1548 to 1558 because the estate had been totally destroyed in 1548. \nThe building was burnt down by Hungarian rebels in 1621 during an anti-Habsburg riot. \nIn 1650, abbot Michael Schnabel arranged the rebuilding to a castle, which was finished in 1667.  Emperor [[Leopold I, Holy Roman Emperor|Leopold I.]] lingered several times at Castle Trumau. \nSince 1959, the castle also has a sundial. \nDuring the 5th Austrian [[Ottoman wars in Europe|T\u00fcrkenkrieg]] the castle was heavily damaged in 1683. In course of the rebuilding, the towers were gravely changed. Further fires like in 1811 and 1880 damaged the castle again and again. \nThe last restorations took place from 1993 until 1995. Two sundials were discovered in the inner yard. \nIn 2009, the [[International Theological Institute]] moved into the castle Trumau.\n\n==References==\n{{Refbegin}}\n* Hermann Watzl: Schloss Trumau.

This is the second-largest population outside of Israel, and after that in the United States. A quarter of the historic [[Ashkenazi]] Jewish population in France died in the [[Holocaust]] of World War II. After the war, the French government passed laws to suppress antisemitic discrimination and actions, and to protect Jews in the country.<ref name=NYT/>\n\nIn the 1950s and 1960s, many Sephardic Jews emigrated to France from countries such as Algeria, Morocco, and Tunisia, which had gained independence from colonial rule through extended warfare against France.<ref name=NYT/> The wars for independence left both sides with considerable bitterness, and Algeria was immersed in civil war for years after gaining independence. Jews left North Africa as relations in the area became more strained during the [[Six-Day War]] of 1967 between Israel, Egypt and other Arab forces. This increased tensions across the Arab world. The rise of the [[Second Intifada]], beginning in 2000, contributed to rising tensions with Arab Muslims and Jews feeling less welcome in North African nations. Most have now left the region.<ref name=NYT/>\n\nBeginning in the late 20th century, more Arabs from North African nations began to emigrate to France for economic reasons and to escape civil wars in their home nations. Historically numerous North African Arabs had lived and worked in France since before World War II. The Muslim community built the [[Grand Mosque (Paris)|Grand Mosque]] in Paris in 1929. Its Imam ([[Si Kaddour Benghabrit]]) and numerous members helped protect Jews from deportation during the Holocaust.<ref>[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/10/06/AR2006100601417.html \"The Holocaust 's Arab Heroes\"], ''[[The Washington Post]]'', October 8, 2006, [[Robert Satloff]]</ref>\n\nIn the mid-1990s historians renewed a critical study of [[National Socialism]], collaboration, and the responsibility of the [[Vichy France|Vichy Regime]] for deportation of Jews during the [[Holocaust]].

France has the largest population of Jews in the diaspora after the United States\u2014an estimated 500,000\u2013600,000 persons. Paris has the highest population, followed by Marseilles, which has 70,000 Jews, most of North African origin.\nExpressions of anti-semitism were seen to rise during the [[Six-Day War]] of 1967 and the French [[Anti-Zionism|anti-Zionist]] campaign of the 1970s and 1980s.<ref>[http://navon.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/France-Israel-and-the-Jews_39-1.pdf Emmanuel Navon, \"France, Israel, and the Jews: The End of an Era?\"], ''Israel Journal of Foreign Affairs'', 2015, https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/23739770.2015.1042277</ref><ref>[http://frblogs.timesofisrael.com/le-surmoi-antisemite-de-la-television-francaise/ \"Le Surmoi antis\u00e9mite de la T\u00e9l\u00e9vision Fran\u00e7aise\"], ''Times of Israel''</ref> Following the electoral successes achieved by the extreme right-wing [[National Front (France)|National Front]] and an increasing denial of [[the Holocaust]] among some persons in the 1990s, surveys showed an increase in stereotypical antisemitic beliefs among the general French population.<ref>[https://www.ushmm.org/wlc/en/article.php?ModuleId=10008003], US Holocaust Museum</ref><ref>[http://www.democraticunion.eu/2014/11/holocaust-denial-legal-concept-europe/ \"Holocaust denial/legal concepts in Europe\"], Democratic Union</ref><ref>https://mondediplo.com/1998/05/08igou</ref>\n\nAt the beginning of the 21st century, [[antisemitism]] in France rose sharply during the unrest of the [[Second Intifada]] in Israel and the Palestinian territories, as it did in other European nations.<ref name=EUMC/> In addition, a significant proportion of the second-generation [[Islam in France|Muslim immigrant population]] in France began to identify with the Palestinian cause, with some also identifying with radical Islamism.<ref name=NYT>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/03/26/international/26antisemitism.html |title=Jews in France Feel Sting as Antisemitism Surges Among Children of Immigrants|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=26 March 2006 |first=Craig S. |last=Smith |accessdate=2010-05-04}}</ref><ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/2004/02/29/magazine/a-frenchman-or-a-jew.html?pagewanted=all&src=pm \"A Frenchman Or a Jew?\" By Fernanda Eberstadt], ''New York Times Magazine'', February 29, 2004</ref><ref>[http://www.haaretz.com/jewish-world/jewish-world-features/.premium-1.574909 Daniella Peled, \"French hatred of Jews goes far beyond Muslim antisemitism, says U.K. author\"], ''Haaretz'', 18 February 2014</ref> In the early 2000s, a critical debate on the nature of antisemitism in France accompanied denunciation of it in relation to the situation in the Middle East and to Islam.

By early 2014 the number of French Jews making [[aliyah]] (emigrating to Israel) surpassed the number of American Jews who were emigrating. At the same time 70 percent of French Jews reported in surveys that they were concerned about insults or harassment and 60% about physical aggression because of their ethnicity; both figures are much higher than shown in surveys of the European average.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dw.de/alarmed-by-anti-semitism-french-jews-consider-flight/a-17493908|title=Alarmed by anti-Semitism, French Jews consider flight|work=Deutsche Welt}}</ref>\n\n==Background==\nAt the turn of the 21st century, France had an estimated 500,000 to 600,000 Jews, most of them [[Sephardi Jews|Sephardic]] and of North African origin. This is the second-largest population outside of Israel, and after that in the United States. A quarter of the historic [[Ashkenazi]] Jewish population in France died in the [[Holocaust]] of World War II. After the war, the French government passed laws to suppress antisemitic discrimination and actions, and to protect Jews in the country.<ref name=NYT/>\n\nIn the 1950s and 1960s, many Sephardic Jews emigrated to France from countries such as Algeria, Morocco, and Tunisia, which had gained independence from colonial rule through extended warfare against France.<ref name=NYT/> The wars for independence left both sides with considerable bitterness, and Algeria was immersed in civil war for years after gaining independence. Jews left North Africa as relations in the area became more strained during the [[Six-Day War]] of 1967 between Israel, Egypt and other Arab forces. This increased tensions across the Arab world. The rise of the [[Second Intifada]], beginning in 2000, contributed to rising tensions with Arab Muslims and Jews feeling less welcome in North African nations. Most have now left the region.<ref name=NYT/>\n\nBeginning in the late 20th century, more Arabs from North African nations began to emigrate to France for economic reasons and to escape civil wars in their home nations. Historically numerous North African Arabs had lived and worked in France since before World War II. The Muslim community built the [[Grand Mosque (Paris)|Grand Mosque]] in Paris in 1929. Its Imam ([[Si Kaddour Benghabrit]]) and numerous members helped protect Jews from deportation during the Holocaust.<ref>[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/10/06/AR2006100601417.html \"The Holocaust 's Arab Heroes\"], ''[[The Washington Post]]'', October 8, 2006, [[Robert Satloff]]</ref>\n\nIn the mid-1990s historians renewed a critical study of [[National Socialism]], collaboration, and the responsibility of the [[Vichy France|Vichy Regime]] for deportation of Jews during the [[Holocaust]]. They contested the book ''Vichy France: Old Guard and New Order, 1940-1944'' (1972) (published in French as ''La France de Vichy'') by American historian [[Robert Paxton]], who had said the Vichy Regime cooperated with Nazi Germany.<ref name=EUMC>{{cite web|title=Manifestations of Antisemitism in the European Union |url=http://www.erinnern.at/bundeslaender/oesterreich/e_bibliothek/antisemitismus-1/431_anti-semitism_in_the_european_union.pdf |author=Werner Bergmann and Juliane Wentzel |publisher=EUMC (European Monitoring Centre on Racism and Xenophobia)|date=February 2003|accessdate=9 March 2013}}</ref>\n\nBritish historian [[Maud S. Mandel]] bases her inquiry ''Jews and Muslims in France: A History of a Conflict'' (2014) on historic relations among the peoples of North Africa.

In many of these communities, such as [[Nice]] and [[Marseilles]], Arab and Jewish immigrants from North African nations have lived in mixed communities as they began to make new lives in France. Both Jews and Muslims are minorities in France.<!--Provide numbers of Arab Muslims --> Many North African Jews worked with Arab immigrants to combat racism in France against the latter group, and support other progressive causes.\n\nFrench concerns about antisemitism among second-generation Arab groups is also related to general concerns about Islamic [[terrorism]] in the country. In 2015 Paris suffered two major Islamic attacks, which were generally targeted at all French people. In addition, from the end of 2015 into early 2016, there were independent attacks against individual Jews in several cities, including three in Marseilles from October to January.\n\nIn 2017 it was reported that \"A former principal at a preparatory school for teenagers...said he regularly advised Jews not to attend his institution for fear of harassment by other students\" and that only a third of Jews attend public schools.<ref name=\"LipshizHarassed\">{{cite news|last1=Lipshiz|first1=Cnaan|title=Principal in France says he warned Jews not to attend his school because they'd be harassed|url=http://www.jta.org/2017/09/08/news-opinion/world/french-ex-principal-reveals-he-advised-jews-not-to-attend-his-school-for-their-safety|accessdate=8 September 2017|publisher=JTA|date=8 September 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Antisemitic acts==\nThe National Consultative Commission on Human Rights (Commission nationale consultative des droits de l'homme, CNCDH) has issued annual reports on antisemitic activities as part of the French oversight of human rights.
