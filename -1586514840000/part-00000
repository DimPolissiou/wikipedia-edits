For me she has taken on a heroic stature achieved by very few other people in history. To venture, as she did, into academia, a world almost no woman had yet explored, and to be consequently the object of curious scrutiny, while a doubting society looked on, half-expecting her to fail, took tremendous courage and determination.

She herself used '''Sophie Kowalevski''' (or occasionally '''Kowalevsky''') in her academic publications.\n\n==Background and early education==\nSofya Kovalevskaya (''[[n\u00e9e]]'' Korvin-Krukovskaya) was born in Moscow, the second of three children. Her father, Lieutenant General Vasily Vasilyevich Korvin-Krukovsky, served in the [[Imperial Russian Army]] as head of the Moscow Artillery before retiring to Palibino, his family estate in [[Vitebsk Region]] in 1858, when Kovalevskaya was eight years old. He was a member of the minor nobility, of mixed (Bela)Russian\u2013Polish descent (Polish on his father's side), with possible partial ancestry from the [[Hunyadi family|royal Corvin family of Hungary]], and served as Marshall of Nobility for Vitebsk province. (There may also have been some [[Romani people|Romani]] ancestry on the father's side.<ref>{{cite web|title=Women mathematicians|author=Marie-Louise Dubreil-Jacotin|url=http://www.gap-system.org/~history/Extras/Women_mathematicians.html|publisher=JOC/EFR|accessdate=June 3, 2012|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110607183749/http://www.gap-system.org/~history/Extras/Women_mathematicians.html|archivedate=June 7, 2011|author-link=Marie-Louise Dubreil-Jacotin}}</ref>)\n\nHer mother, Yelizaveta Fedorovna Shubert (Schubert), descended from a family of German immigrants to St. Petersburg who lived on Vasilievsky Island. Her maternal great grandfather was the astronomer and geographer [[Theodor von Schubert|Friedrich Theodor Schubert]] (1758\u22121825), who emigrated to Russia from Germany around 1785. He became a full member of the St. Petersburg Academy of Science and head of its astronomical observatory. His son, Kovalevskaya's maternal grandfather, was General [[Friedrich von Schubert|Theodor Friedrich von Schubert]] (1789\u22121865), who was head of the military topographic service, and an honorary member of the Russian Academy of Sciences, as well as Director of the Kunstkamera museum.\n\nKovalevskaya's parents provided her with a good early education.  At various times, her governesses were native speakers of English, French, and German. \nWhen she was 8 or 9 years old, she was intrigued by a foretaste of what she was to learn later in her lessons in calculus; the wall of her room had been papered with pages from lecture notes by [[Mikhail Ostrogradsky|Ostrogradsky]], left over from her father's student days.<ref>{{cite web|title=Best of Russia --- Famous Russians --- Scientists.|url=http://www.tristarmedia.com/bestofrussia/scientists.html|work=TRISTARMEDIA {{!}} Web Design, Web Development, Multimedia, Creative Web Solutions|accessdate=21 October 2011|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110903172506/http://www.tristarmedia.com/bestofrussia/scientists.html|archivedate=3 September 2011}}</ref> \nShe was tutored privately in elementary mathematics by Iosif Ignatevich Malevich.\n\nThe physicist Nikolai Nikanorovich Tyrtov noted her unusual\naptitude when she managed to understand his textbook by discovering for herself an approximate construction of trigonometric functions\nwhich she had not yet encountered in her studies.<ref>F.

During that same period, the son of a local priest introduced her [[Anne Jaclard|sister Anna]] to progressive ideas influenced by the \"[[Narodniks|Movement of the 1860's]]\", providing her with copies of radical journals of the time discussing [[nihilism#Russian nihilist movement|nihilism]].<ref>Sofya Kovalevskaya, ''A Russian Childhood'', translated, edited, and introduced by Beatrice Stillman ; with an analysis of Kovalevskaya's Mathematics by P.

For the nihilists, science appeared to be the most effective means of helping the mass of people to a better life.  Science pushed back the barriers of religion and superstition, and \"proved\" through the theory of evolution that (peaceful) social revolutions were the way of nature.  For the early nihilists, science was virtually synonymous with truth, progress and radicalism; thus, the pursuit of a scientific career was viewed in no way as a hindrance to social activism.  In fact, it was seen as a positive boost to progressive forces, an active blow against backwardness.<ref name=\"ahk2\">Ann Hibner Koblitz, ''Science, Women and Revolution in Russia'', Routledge, 2000.</ref>{{rp|2\u20134}} }}\n\nDespite her obvious talent for mathematics, she could not complete her education in Russia. At that time, women were not allowed to attend universities in Russia and most other countries.  In order to study abroad, Kovalevskaya needed written permission from her father (or husband). Accordingly, in 1868 she contracted a \"fictitious marriage\" with [[Vladimir Kovalevskij]], a young paleontology student, book publisher and radical, who was the first to translate and publish the works of [[Charles Darwin]] in Russia. They moved from Russia to Germany in 1869, after a brief stay in Vienna, in order to pursue advanced studies.<ref name=RCooke>Roger Cooke, ''The Mathematics of Sonya Kovalevskaya'', Springer-Verlag, 1984.</ref>\n\n==Student years==\nIn April 1869, following Sofia's and Vladimir's brief stay in Vienna, where she attended lectures in physics at the university, they moved to Heidelberg. Through great efforts, she obtained \npermission to audit classes with the professors' approval at the [[University of Heidelberg]].  There she attended courses in physics and mathematics under such teachers as [[Hermann von Helmholtz]], [[Gustav Kirchhoff]] and [[Robert Bunsen]].<ref name=\"ahk1\"/>{{rp|87\u201389}}  Vladimir, meanwhile, went on to\nthe University of Jena to pursue a doctorate in paleontology.\n\nIn October 1869, shortly after attending courses in Heidelberg, she visited London with Vladimir, who spent time with his colleagues [[Thomas Huxley]] and [[Charles Darwin]], while she was invited to attend [[George Eliot]]'s Sunday salons.<ref name=\"RCooke\"/> There, at age nineteen, she met [[Herbert Spencer]] and was led into a debate, at Eliot's instigation, on \"woman's capacity for abstract thought\".  Although there is no record of the details of their conversation, she had just completed a lecture course in Heidelberg on mechanics, and  she may just possibly have made mention of the Euler equations governing the motion of a rigid body (see following section).  George Eliot was writing ''[[Middlemarch]]'' at the time, in which one finds the remarkable sentence: \"In short, woman was a problem which, since Mr. Brooke's mind felt blank before it, could hardly be less complicated than the revolutions of an irregular solid.\"<ref>George Eliot (Mary Ann Evans), ''Middlemarch'', Chapter IV, last sentence.</ref>   This was well before she made her notable contribution of the \"[[Kovalevskaya Top|Kovalevskaya top]]\" to the brief list of known examples of integrable rigid body motion (see following section).\n\nIn October 1870, Kovalevskaya moved to Berlin, where she began to take private lessons with [[Karl Weierstrass]], since the university would not allow her even to audit classes. He was very impressed\nwith her mathematical skills, and over the subsequent three years taught her the same material that comprised his lectures at the university.\n\nIn 1871 she briefly traveled to Paris together with Vladimir in order to help in the [[Paris Commune]], where Kovalevskaya attended the injured and her sister Anyuta was active in the Commune.<ref name=\"ahk1\"/>{{rp|104\u2013106}} With the fall of the Commune, however, both Anyuta and her common law husband [[Victor Jaclard]], who was leader of the Montmartre contingent of the National Guard and a prominent Blanquiste, were arrested. Although Anyuta managed to escape to London, Jaclard was sentenced to execution. However, with the assistance of Sofia's and Anyuta's father General Krukovsky, who had come urgently to Paris to help Anyuta and who wrote to Adolphe Thiers asking for clemency, they managed to save [[Victor Jaclard]].<ref name=\"ahk1\"/>{{rp|107\u2013108}}\n\nKovalevskaya returned to Berlin and continued her studies with Weierstrass for three more years. In 1874 she presented three papers\u2014on [[partial differential equation]]s, on the dynamics of [[Saturn]]'s [[Rings of Saturn|rings]], and on [[elliptic integral]]s\u2014to the [[University of G\u00f6ttingen]] as her doctoral dissertation. With the support of Weierstrass, this earned her a doctorate in mathematics ''summa cum laude'', after Weierstrass succeeded in having her exempted from the usual oral examinations.<ref name=\"RCooke\"/>\n\nKovalevskaya thereby became the first woman to have been awarded a doctorate at a European university. Her paper on partial differential equations contains what is now commonly known as the [[Cauchy\u2013Kovalevskaya theorem]], which proves the existence and analyticity\nof local solutions to such equations under suitably defined initial/boundary conditions.\n\n==Last years in Germany and Sweden==\n[[File:Sofya Vasilyevna Kovalevskaya Bust.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Bust by Finnish sculptor [[Walter Runeberg]]]]\n[[Image:Sofia Kovalevskaya grave.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Kovalevskaya's grave, [[Norra begravningsplatsen]]]]\n\nIn 1874, Kovalevskaya and her husband Vladimir returned to Russia, but Vladimir failed to secure a professorship because of his radical beliefs. (Kovalevskaya never would have been considered for such a position because of her gender.)  During this time they tried a variety of schemes to support themselves, including real estate development and involvement with an oil company.  But in the late 1870s they developed financial problems, leading to bankruptcy.<ref>{{cite book|last=Kochina|first=Pelageya|title=Love and Mathematics: Sofia Kovalevskaya|year=1985|publisher=Mir Publisher|location=Moscow}}</ref><ref name=\"ahk1\"/>\n\nIn 1875, for some unknown reason, perhaps the death of her father, Sofia and Vladimir decided to spend several years together as an actual married couple. Three years later their daughter, Sofia (called \"Fufa\"), was born. After almost two years devoted to raising her daughter, Kovalevskaya put Fufa under the care of relatives and friends, resumed her work in mathematics, and left Vladimir for what would be the last time.\n\nVladimir, who had always suffered severe mood swings, became more unstable. In 1883, faced with worsening mood swings and the possibility of being prosecuted for his role in a stock swindle, Vladimir committed suicide.<ref name=\"RCooke\"/>\n\nThat year, with the help of the mathematician [[G\u00f6sta Mittag-Leffler]], whom she had known as a fellow student of [[Karl Weierstrass|Weierstrass]], Kovalevskaya was able to secure a position as a ''privat-docent'' at [[Stockholm University]] in Sweden.<ref name=\"RCooke\"/> Kovalevskaya met Mittag-Leffler's sister, the actress, novelist, and playwright [[Anne Charlotte Leffler|Anne Charlotte Edgren-Leffler]]. Until Kovalevskaya's death the two women shared a close friendship.<ref>McFadden, Margaret. ''Golden Cables of Sympathy: The Transatlantic Sources of Nineteenth-Century Feminism.'' University Press of Kentucky, 1999.</ref>\n\nIn 1884 Kovalevskaya was appointed to a five-year position as Extraordinary Professor (assistant professor in modern terminology) and became an editor of [[Acta Mathematica]]. In 1888 she won the ''Prix Bordin'' of the French Academy of Science, for her work \"M\u00e9moire sur un cas particulier du probl\u00e8me de la rotation d'un corps pesant autour d'un point fixe, o\u00f9 l'int\u00e9gration s'effectue \u00e0 l'aide des fonctions ultraelliptiques du temps\".<ref name=RCooke/><ref>Sof\u02b9ja Vasil\u02b9evna Kovalevskaja, ''[https://books.google.ca/books/about/M%C3%A9moire_sur_un_cas_particulier_du_probl.html?id=8r72rQEACAAJ&redir_esc=y M\u00e9moire sur un cas particulier du probl\u00e8me de la rotation d'un corps pesant autour d'un point fixe o\u00f9 l'int\u00e9gration s'effectue \u00e0 l'aide de fonctions ultraelliptiques du temps]'', IMprimerie nationale, 1894</ref> Her submission featured the celebrated discovery of what is now known as the \"[[Kovalevskaya top]]\", which was subsequently shown to be the only other case of [[rigid body]] motion that is \"completely [[integrable systems|integrable]]\" other than the tops of [[Leonhard Euler|Euler]] and [[Joseph-Louis Lagrange|Lagrange]].<ref name=cooke>{{Cite book| last = Cooke | first = Roger | title = The Mathematics of Sonya Kovalevskaya  | publisher = Springer | year = 1984 | page = 159| isbn = 9781461297666}}</ref>\n\nIn 1889 Kovalevskaya was appointed Ordinary Professor (full professor) at Stockholm University, the first woman in Europe in modern times to hold such a position.<ref name=\"ahk1\"/>{{rp|218}} After much lobbying on her behalf (and a change in the Academy's rules) she was made a Corresponding Member of the [[Russian Academy of Sciences]], but she was never offered a professorship in Russia.\n\nKovalevskaya, who was involved in the vibrant, politically progressive and feminist currents of late nineteenth-century Russian nihilism, wrote several non-mathematical works as well, including a memoir, ''A Russian Childhood'', two plays (in collaboration with Duchess Anne Charlotte Edgren-Leffler) and a partly autobiographical novel, ''Nihilist Girl'' (1890).\n\nIn 1889, Kovalevskaya fell in love with [[Maksim Kovalevsky|Maxim Kovalevsky]], a distant relation of her deceased husband,<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite book|title=Math and mathematicians : the history of math discoveries around the world|last=Bruno|first=Leonard C.|date=2003|origyear=1999|publisher=U X L|others=Baker, Lawrence W.|isbn=0787638145|location=Detroit, Mich.|pages=251|oclc=41497065}}</ref> but insisted on not marrying him because she would not be able to settle down and live with him.<ref name=\"rlc\"/>{{rp|18}}\n\nKovalevskaya died of [[1889\u20131890 flu pandemic|influenza]] complicated by pneumonia in 1891 at age forty-one, after returning from a vacation in Nice with Maxim.<ref name=\"ahk1\"/>{{rp|231}} She is buried in [[Solna Municipality|Solna]], Sweden, at [[Norra begravningsplatsen]].\n\nKovalevskaya's mathematical results, such as the [[Cauchy\u2013Kowalevski theorem]], and her pioneering role as a female mathematician in an almost exclusively male-dominated field, have made her the subject of several books, including a biography by Ann Hibner Koblitz,<ref name=\"ahk1\"/> a biography in Russian by Polubarinova-Kochina<ref>P.

She herself used '''Sophie Kowalevski''' (or occasionally '''Kowalevsky''') in her academic publications.\n\n==Background and early education==\nSofya Kovalevskaya (''[[n\u00e9e]]'' Korvin-Krukovskaya) was born in Moscow, the second of three children. Her father, Lieutenant General Vasily Vasilyevich Korvin-Krukovsky, served in the [[Imperial Russian Army]] as head of the Moscow Artillery before retiring to Palibino, his family estate in [[Vitebsk Region]] in 1858, when Kovalevskaya was eight years old. He was a member of the minor nobility, of mixed (Bela)Russian\u2013Polish descent (Polish on his father's side), with possible partial ancestry from the [[Hunyadi family|royal Corvin family of Hungary]], and served as Marshall of Nobility for Vitebsk province. (There may also have been some [[Romani people|Romani]] ancestry on the father's side.<ref>{{cite web|title=Women mathematicians|author=Marie-Louise Dubreil-Jacotin|url=http://www.gap-system.org/~history/Extras/Women_mathematicians.html|publisher=JOC/EFR|accessdate=June 3, 2012|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110607183749/http://www.gap-system.org/~history/Extras/Women_mathematicians.html|archivedate=June 7, 2011|author-link=Marie-Louise Dubreil-Jacotin}}</ref>)\n\nHer mother, Yelizaveta Fedorovna Shubert (Schubert), descended from a family of German immigrants to St. Petersburg who lived on Vasilievsky Island. Her maternal great grandfather was the astronomer and geographer [[Theodor von Schubert|Friedrich Theodor Schubert]] (1758\u22121825), who emigrated to Russia from Germany around 1785. He became a full member of the St. Petersburg Academy of Science and head of its astronomical observatory. His son, Kovalevskaya's maternal grandfather, was General [[Friedrich von Schubert|Theodor Friedrich von Schubert]] (1789\u22121865), who was head of the military topographic service, and an honorary member of the Russian Academy of Sciences, as well as Director of the Kunstkamera museum.\n\nKovalevskaya's parents provided her with a good early education.  At various times, her governesses were native speakers of English, French, and German. \nWhen she was 8 or 9 years old, she was intrigued by a foretaste of what she was to learn later in her lessons in calculus; the wall of her room had been papered with pages from lecture notes by [[Mikhail Ostrogradsky|Ostrogradsky]], left over from her father's student days.<ref>{{cite web|title=Best of Russia --- Famous Russians --- Scientists.|url=http://www.tristarmedia.com/bestofrussia/scientists.html|work=TRISTARMEDIA {{!}} Web Design, Web Development, Multimedia, Creative Web Solutions|accessdate=21 October 2011|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110903172506/http://www.tristarmedia.com/bestofrussia/scientists.html|archivedate=3 September 2011}}</ref> \nShe was tutored privately in elementary mathematics by Iosif Ignatevich Malevich.\n\nThe physicist Nikolai Nikanorovich Tyrtov noted her unusual\naptitude when she managed to understand his textbook by discovering for herself an approximate construction of trigonometric functions\nwhich she had not yet encountered in her studies.<ref>F.

During that same period, the son of a local priest introduced her [[Anne Jaclard|sister Anna]] to progressive ideas influenced by the \"[[Narodniks|Movement of the 1860's]]\", providing her with copies of radical journals of the time discussing [[nihilism#Russian nihilist movement|nihilism]].<ref>Sofya Kovalevskaya, ''A Russian Childhood'', translated, edited, and introduced by Beatrice Stillman ; with an analysis of Kovalevskaya's Mathematics by P.

For the nihilists, science appeared to be the most effective means of helping the mass of people to a better life.  Science pushed back the barriers of religion and superstition, and \"proved\" through the theory of evolution that (peaceful) social revolutions were the way of nature.  For the early nihilists, science was virtually synonymous with truth, progress and radicalism; thus, the pursuit of a scientific career was viewed in no way as a hindrance to social activism.  In fact, it was seen as a positive boost to progressive forces, an active blow against backwardness.<ref name=\"ahk2\">Ann Hibner Koblitz, ''Science, Women and Revolution in Russia'', Routledge, 2000.</ref>{{rp|2\u20134}} }}\n\nDespite her obvious talent for mathematics, she could not complete her education in Russia. At that time, women were not allowed to attend universities in Russia and most other countries.  In order to study abroad, Kovalevskaya needed written permission from her father (or husband). Accordingly, in 1868 she contracted a \"fictitious marriage\" with [[Vladimir Kovalevskij]], a young paleontology student, book publisher and radical, who was the first to translate and publish the works of [[Charles Darwin]] in Russia. They moved from Russia to Germany in 1869, after a brief stay in Vienna, in order to pursue advanced studies.<ref name=RCooke>Roger Cooke, ''The Mathematics of Sonya Kovalevskaya'', Springer-Verlag, 1984.</ref>\n\n==Student years==\nIn April 1869, following Sofia's and Vladimir's brief stay in Vienna, where she attended lectures in physics at the university, they moved to Heidelberg. Through great efforts, she obtained \npermission to audit classes with the professors' approval at the [[University of Heidelberg]].  There she attended courses in physics and mathematics under such teachers as [[Hermann von Helmholtz]], [[Gustav Kirchhoff]] and [[Robert Bunsen]].<ref name=\"ahk1\"/>{{rp|87\u201389}}  Vladimir, meanwhile, went on to\nthe University of Jena to pursue a doctorate in paleontology.\n\nIn October 1869, shortly after attending courses in Heidelberg, she visited London with Vladimir, who spent time with his colleagues [[Thomas Huxley]] and [[Charles Darwin]], while she was invited to attend [[George Eliot]]'s Sunday salons.<ref name=\"RCooke\"/> There, at age nineteen, she met [[Herbert Spencer]] and was led into a debate, at Eliot's instigation, on \"woman's capacity for abstract thought\".  Although there is no record of the details of their conversation, she had just completed a lecture course in Heidelberg on mechanics, and  she may just possibly have made mention of the Euler equations governing the motion of a rigid body (see following section).  George Eliot was writing ''[[Middlemarch]]'' at the time, in which one finds the remarkable sentence: \"In short, woman was a problem which, since Mr. Brooke's mind felt blank before it, could hardly be less complicated than the revolutions of an irregular solid.\"<ref>George Eliot (Mary Ann Evans), ''Middlemarch'', Chapter IV, last sentence.</ref>   This was well before she made her notable contribution of the \"[[Kovalevskaya Top|Kovalevskaya top]]\" to the brief list of known examples of integrable rigid body motion (see following section).\n\nIn October 1870, Kovalevskaya moved to Berlin, where she began to take private lessons with [[Karl Weierstrass]], since the university would not allow her even to audit classes. He was very impressed\nwith her mathematical skills, and over the subsequent three years taught her the same material that comprised his lectures at the university.\n\nIn 1871 she briefly traveled to Paris together with Vladimir in order to help in the [[Paris Commune]], where Kovalevskaya attended the injured and her sister Anyuta was active in the Commune.<ref name=\"ahk1\"/>{{rp|104\u2013106}} With the fall of the Commune, however, both Anyuta and her common law husband [[Victor Jaclard]], who was leader of the Montmartre contingent of the National Guard and a prominent Blanquiste, were arrested. Although Anyuta managed to escape to London, Jaclard was sentenced to execution. However, with the assistance of Sofia's and Anyuta's father General Krukovsky, who had come urgently to Paris to help Anyuta and who wrote to Adolphe Thiers asking for clemency, they managed to save [[Victor Jaclard]].<ref name=\"ahk1\"/>{{rp|107\u2013108}}\n\nKovalevskaya returned to Berlin and continued her studies with Weierstrass for three more years. In 1874 she presented three papers\u2014on [[partial differential equation]]s, on the dynamics of [[Saturn]]'s [[Rings of Saturn|rings]], and on [[elliptic integral]]s\u2014to the [[University of G\u00f6ttingen]] as her doctoral dissertation. With the support of Weierstrass, this earned her a doctorate in mathematics ''summa cum laude'', after Weierstrass succeeded in having her exempted from the usual oral examinations.<ref name=\"RCooke\"/>\n\nKovalevskaya thereby became the first woman to have been awarded a doctorate at a European university. Her paper on partial differential equations contains what is now commonly known as the [[Cauchy\u2013Kovalevskaya theorem]], which proves the existence and analyticity\nof local solutions to such equations under suitably defined initial/boundary conditions.\n\n==Last years in Germany and Sweden==\n[[File:Sofya Vasilyevna Kovalevskaya Bust.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Bust by Finnish sculptor [[Walter Runeberg]]]]\n[[Image:Sofia Kovalevskaya grave.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Kovalevskaya's grave, [[Norra begravningsplatsen]]]]\n\nIn 1874, Kovalevskaya and her husband Vladimir returned to Russia, but Vladimir failed to secure a professorship because of his radical beliefs. (Kovalevskaya never would have been considered for such a position because of her gender.)  During this time they tried a variety of schemes to support themselves, including real estate development and involvement with an oil company.  But in the late 1870s they developed financial problems, leading to bankruptcy.<ref>{{cite book|last=Kochina|first=Pelageya|title=Love and Mathematics: Sofia Kovalevskaya|year=1985|publisher=Mir Publisher|location=Moscow}}</ref><ref name=\"ahk1\"/>\n\nIn 1875, for some unknown reason, perhaps the death of her father, Sofia and Vladimir decided to spend several years together as an actual married couple. Three years later their daughter, Sofia (called \"Fufa\"), was born. After almost two years devoted to raising her daughter, Kovalevskaya put Fufa under the care of relatives and friends, resumed her work in mathematics, and left Vladimir for what would be the last time.\n\nVladimir, who had always suffered severe mood swings, became more unstable. In 1883, faced with worsening mood swings and the possibility of being prosecuted for his role in a stock swindle, Vladimir committed suicide.<ref name=\"RCooke\"/>\n\nThat year, with the help of the mathematician [[G\u00f6sta Mittag-Leffler]], whom she had known as a fellow student of [[Karl Weierstrass|Weierstrass]], Kovalevskaya was able to secure a position as a ''privat-docent'' at [[Stockholm University]] in Sweden.<ref name=\"RCooke\"/> Kovalevskaya met Mittag-Leffler's sister, the actress, novelist, and playwright [[Anne Charlotte Leffler|Anne Charlotte Edgren-Leffler]]. Until Kovalevskaya's death the two women shared a close friendship.<ref>McFadden, Margaret. ''Golden Cables of Sympathy: The Transatlantic Sources of Nineteenth-Century Feminism.''

In 1888 she won the ''Prix Bordin'' of the French Academy of Science, for her work \"M\u00e9moire sur un cas particulier du probl\u00e8me de la rotation d'un corps pesant autour d'un point fixe, o\u00f9 l'int\u00e9gration s'effectue \u00e0 l'aide des fonctions ultraelliptiques du temps\".<ref name=RCooke/><ref>Sof\u02b9ja Vasil\u02b9evna Kovalevskaja, ''[https://books.google.ca/books/about/M%C3%A9moire_sur_un_cas_particulier_du_probl.html?id=8r72rQEACAAJ&redir_esc=y M\u00e9moire sur un cas particulier du probl\u00e8me de la rotation d'un corps pesant autour d'un point fixe o\u00f9 l'int\u00e9gration s'effectue \u00e0 l'aide de fonctions ultraelliptiques du temps]'', IMprimerie nationale, 1894</ref> Her submission featured the celebrated discovery of what is now known as the \"[[Kovalevskaya top]]\", which was subsequently shown to be the only other case of [[rigid body]] motion that is \"completely [[integrable systems|integrable]]\" other than the tops of [[Leonhard Euler|Euler]] and [[Joseph-Louis Lagrange|Lagrange]].<ref name=cooke>{{Cite book| last = Cooke | first = Roger | title = The Mathematics of Sonya Kovalevskaya  | publisher = Springer | year = 1984 | page = 159| isbn = 9781461297666}}</ref>\n\nIn 1889 Kovalevskaya was appointed Ordinary Professor (full professor) at Stockholm University, the first woman in Europe in modern times to hold such a position.<ref name=\"ahk1\"/>{{rp|218}} After much lobbying on her behalf (and a change in the Academy's rules) she was made a Corresponding Member of the [[Russian Academy of Sciences]], but she was never offered a professorship in Russia.\n\nKovalevskaya, who was involved in the vibrant, politically progressive and feminist currents of late nineteenth-century Russian nihilism, wrote several non-mathematical works as well, including a memoir, ''A Russian Childhood'', two plays (in collaboration with Duchess Anne Charlotte Edgren-Leffler) and a partly autobiographical novel, ''Nihilist Girl'' (1890).\n\nIn 1889, Kovalevskaya fell in love with [[Maksim Kovalevsky|Maxim Kovalevsky]], a distant relation of her deceased husband,<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite book|title=Math and mathematicians : the history of math discoveries around the world|last=Bruno|first=Leonard C.|date=2003|origyear=1999|publisher=U X L|others=Baker, Lawrence W.|isbn=0787638145|location=Detroit, Mich.|pages=251|oclc=41497065}}</ref> but insisted on not marrying him because she would not be able to settle down and live with him.<ref name=\"rlc\"/>{{rp|18}}\n\nKovalevskaya died of [[1889\u20131890 flu pandemic|influenza]] complicated by pneumonia in 1891 at age forty-one, after returning from a vacation in Nice with Maxim.<ref name=\"ahk1\"/>{{rp|231}} She is buried in [[Solna Municipality|Solna]], Sweden, at [[Norra begravningsplatsen]].\n\nKovalevskaya's mathematical results, such as the [[Cauchy\u2013Kowalevski theorem]], and her pioneering role as a female mathematician in an almost exclusively male-dominated field, have made her the subject of several books, including a biography by Ann Hibner Koblitz,<ref name=\"ahk1\"/> a biography in Russian by Polubarinova-Kochina<ref>P.

Following the raid, the trustees required all white male residents over the age of 18 to serve as police guards, erecting a blockhouse at Fifth and Main in front of the courthouse to serve as a headquarters.<ref name=louse/>\n\nIn response to the slaughter of 35 [[Union (U.S.)|Union]] cowboys by Confederate guerrillas in Shelby County and to [[William Clarke Quantrill]]'s entrance into Kentucky, [[general (U.S.)|Gen.]] [[John M. Palmer (politician)|John Palmer]] placed 30 members of the Shelby County Home Guard and its captain Edwin Terrell on the federal payroll on April 1, 1865. The men roamed Shelby and its surrounding counties, persecuting Confederate guerrillas and Southern sympathizers. The Shelbyville trustees aimed to encourage them to stay close to the city, though, paying their hotel bills when they were in town. On May 10, Terrell and his men found Quantrill's raiders at a barn outside [[Wakefield, Kentucky|Wakefield]] in [[Spencer County, Kentucky|Spencer Co]]. and fatally shot their leader. The city came out to cheer the men upon their return and the trustees continued paying their room and board for another month after the U.S. Army paid off and disbanded the troupe on May 26.<ref name=louse/> The threat of raiding over, the blockhouse was demolished by September. By that time, Capt. Terrell and his lieutenant Harry Thompson had murdered and robbed an Illinois stock merchant named William R. Johnson. Over the next year, the local jury could not return a verdict. Terrell was transferred to [[Taylorsville, Kentucky|Taylorsville]] to be tried for a separate shooting, but broke jail with two companions on May 26 and returned to Shelbyville to go drinking in its saloons. The town marshal George Caplinger organized a posse and took Terrell by surprise outside the Armstrong Hotel, shooting him in the spine, killing his relative John R. Baker, and fatally wounding bystander Merrett Redding. Taken to Louisville, Terrell avoided trial owing to the gravity of his wound and returned home to [[Harrisonville, Kentucky|Harrisonville]] in October. On the 23rd of that month, Harry Thompson broke jail as well and, according to local lore, [[Gone to Texas|fled to Texas]] and lived out his days as the successful farmer \"Henry T. Grazian\".

The men roamed Shelby and its surrounding counties, persecuting Confederate guerrillas and Southern sympathizers. The Shelbyville trustees aimed to encourage them to stay close to the city, though, paying their hotel bills when they were in town. On May 10, Terrell and his men found Quantrill's raiders at a barn outside [[Wakefield, Kentucky|Wakefield]] in [[Spencer County, Kentucky|Spencer Co]]. and fatally shot their leader.

Over the next year, the local jury could not return a verdict. Terrell was transferred to [[Taylorsville, Kentucky|Taylorsville]] to be tried for a separate shooting, but broke jail with two companions on May 26 and returned to Shelbyville to go drinking in its saloons. The town marshal George Caplinger organized a posse and took Terrell by surprise outside the Armstrong Hotel, shooting him in the spine, killing his relative John R.

Taken to Louisville, Terrell avoided trial owing to the gravity of his wound and returned home to [[Harrisonville, Kentucky|Harrisonville]] in October.

She and her [[sister ship]], {{ship|Japanese battleship|Musashi||2}}, were the heaviest and most powerfully armed battleships ever constructed, displacing 72,800&nbsp;tonnes at full load and armed with nine {{convert|46|cm|in|1|abbr=on}} [[40 cm/45 Type 94 naval gun|Type 94]] main guns, which were the largest guns ever mounted on a warship.\n\nNamed after the ancient Japanese [[Yamato Province]], ''Yamato'' was designed to counter the numerically superior battleship fleet of the [[United States]], Japan's main rival in the [[Pacific Theatre of World War II|Pacific]]. She was laid down in 1937 and formally commissioned a week after the [[Pearl Harbor attack]] in late 1941. Throughout 1942, she served as the [[flagship]] of the [[Combined Fleet]], and in June 1942 Admiral [[Isoroku Yamamoto]] directed the fleet from her bridge during the [[Battle of Midway]], a disastrous defeat for Japan. ''Musashi'' took over as the Combined Fleet flagship in early 1943, and ''Yamato'' spent the rest of the year, and much of 1944, moving between the major Japanese naval bases of [[Chuuk Lagoon|Truk]] and [[Kure, Hiroshima|Kure]] in response to American threats. Although present at the [[Battle of the Philippine Sea]] in June 1944, she played no part in the battle.\n\nThe only time ''Yamato'' fired her main guns at enemy surface targets was in October 1944, when she was sent to engage American forces invading the Philippines during the [[Battle of Leyte Gulf]]. While threatening to sink American troop transports, they encountered a light [[escort carrier]] group of the U.S. Navy's [[Task Force 77 (United States Navy)|Task Force 77]], \"Taffy 3\", in the [[Battle off Samar]]. The Japanese turned back after American air attacks convinced them they were engaging a powerful US carrier fleet.\n\nDuring 1944, the balance of naval power in the Pacific decisively turned against Japan, and by early 1945, its fleet was much depleted and badly hobbled by critical fuel shortages in the home islands. In a desperate attempt to slow the Allied advance, ''Yamato'' was dispatched on [[Operation Ten-Go|a one-way mission]] to [[Okinawa]] in April 1945, with orders to beach herself and fight until destroyed, thus protecting the island. The task force was spotted south of [[Kyushu]] by US submarines and aircraft, and on 7 April 1945 she was sunk by American carrier-based bombers and torpedo bombers with the loss of most of her crew.\n\n==Design and construction==\n{{Main|Yamato-class battleship}}\nDuring the 1930s the Japanese government adopted an [[ultranationalist]] militancy with a view to greatly expand the [[Japanese Empire]].<ref>Willmott (2000), p. 32.</ref> Japan withdrew from the [[League of Nations]] in 1934, renouncing its treaty obligations.<ref>Garzke and Dulin (1985), p. 44.</ref> After withdrawing from the [[Washington Naval Treaty]], which limited the size and power of capital ships, the Imperial Japanese Navy began their design of the new [[Yamato-class battleship|''Yamato'' class]] of heavy battleships.

Further confirmation of Japanese intentions came around 20:00 when the Surface Special Attack Force, navigating the [[Bungo Strait]], was spotted by the American submarines {{USS|Threadfin|SS-410|2}} and {{USS|Hackleback|SS-295|2}}. Both reported ''Yamato''{{'}}s position to the main [[Fast Carrier Task Force|American carrier strike force]],<ref name=\"jackson128\" /><ref name=\"G&D60\" /> but neither could attack because of the speed of the Japanese ships\u2014{{convert|22|knot|mph km/h}}\u2014and their extreme [[zigzag]]ging.<ref name=\"G&D60\" />\n\nThe Allied forces around Okinawa braced for an assault.

The Surface Special Attack Force increased speed to {{convert|24|knot|mph km/h}}, and following standard Japanese anti-aircraft defensive measures, the destroyers began circling ''Yamato''. The first aircraft swooped in to attack at 12:37. ''Yahagi'' turned and raced away at {{convert|35|knot|mph km/h}} in an attempt to draw off some of the attackers; it drew off only an insignificant number. ''Yamato'' was not hit for four minutes, but at 12:41 two bombs obliterated two of her triple 25&nbsp;mm anti-aircraft mounts and blew a hole in the deck. A third bomb then destroyed her radar room and the starboard aft 127&nbsp;mm mount. At 12:45 a single torpedo struck ''Yamato'' far forward on her port side, sending shock waves throughout the ship. At 12:46, another two bombs struck the battleship's port side, one slightly ahead of the aft 155&nbsp;mm centreline turret and the other right on top of the gun. These caused a great deal of damage to the turret and its magazines; only one man survived.<ref name=\"G&D61\" />{{refn|This account is based on Garzke and Dulin's ''Battleships: Axis and Neutral Battleships in World War II''.

Two impacts, on the port side near the [[engine room]] and on one of the [[boiler]] rooms, are confirmed; the third is disputed but is regarded by Garzke and Dulin as probable because it would explain the reported flooding in ''Yamato''{{'}}s auxiliary steering room.

In a coordinated strike, dive bombers flew high overhead to begin their runs while torpedo bombers approached from all directions at just above sea level. Overwhelmed by the number of targets, the battleship's anti-aircraft guns were ineffective, and the Japanese tried desperate measures to break up the attack. ''Yamato''{{'}}s main guns were loaded with [[Beehive (anti-aircraft shell)|''Beehive'']] shells fused to explode one second after firing\u2014a mere {{convert|1000|m|ft|abbr=on}} from the ship\u2014but these had little effect. Three or four torpedoes struck the battleship on the port side and one to starboard. Three hits, close together on the port side, are confirmed: one struck a fire room that had already been hit, one impacted a different fire room, and the third hit the hull adjacent to a damaged outboard engine room, increasing the water flow into that space and possibly flooding nearby locations. The fourth hit, unconfirmed, may have struck aft of the third; Garzke and Dulin believe this would explain the rapid flooding reported in that location.<ref>Garzke and Dulin (1985), pp. 62\u201363.</ref> This attack left ''Yamato'' in a perilous position, listing {{formatnum:15\u201318}}\u00b0 to port. Counterflooding of all remaining starboard void spaces lessened this to {{formatnum:10}}\u00b0, but further correction would have required repairs or flooding the starboard engine and fire rooms. Although the battleship was not yet in danger of sinking, the list meant the main battery was unable to fire and her speed was limited to {{convert|18|knots}}.<ref>Garzke and Dulin (1985), p. 63.</ref>\n\nThe third and most damaging attack developed at about 13:40. At least four bombs hit the ship's superstructure and caused heavy casualties among her 25&nbsp;mm anti-aircraft gun crews. Many near misses drove in her outer plating, compromising her defense against torpedoes. Most serious were four more torpedo impacts. Three exploded on the port side, increasing water flow into the port inner engine room and flooding yet another fire room and the steering gear room. With the auxiliary steering room already under water, the ship lost maneuverability and became stuck in a starboard turn. The fourth torpedo most likely hit the starboard outer engine room, which, along with three other rooms on the starboard side, was being counterflooded to reduce the port list. The torpedo strike accelerated the rate of flooding and trapped many crewmen.<ref>Garzke and Dulin (1985), pp. 64\u201365.</ref>\n\n[[File:Yamato explosion.jpg|thumb|left|upright|alt=A view of the ocean stretching to the horizon with the silhouette of a distant small warship visible to the left.

The battleships represented the epitome of Imperial Japanese naval engineering, and because of their size, speed, and power, visibly embodied Japan's determination and readiness to defend its interests against the [[Western Powers#Colonial \"West\"|Western Powers]] and the United States in particular. [[Shigeru Fukudome]], chief of the Operations Section of the [[Imperial Japanese Navy General Staff]], described the ships as \"symbols of naval power that provided to officers and men alike a profound sense of confidence in their navy.\"<ref>Evans and Peattie (1997), pp. 298, 378.</ref> ''Yamato''{{'}}s symbolic might was such that some Japanese citizens held the belief that their country could never fall as long as the ship was able to fight.<ref>{{cite news | title = A bomb survivors leery of battleship hype | newspaper = [[Yomiuri Shimbun]] | date = 6 August 2006 }}</ref>\n\nDecades after the war, ''Yamato'' was memorialised in various forms by the Japanese. Historically, the word \"Yamato\" was used as a poetic name for Japan; thus, her name became a metaphor for the end of the Japanese empire.<ref>Yoshida and Minear (1985), p. xvii; Evans and Peattie (1997), p. 378.</ref><ref>Skulski (2004), p. 7.</ref> In April 1968, a memorial tower was erected at Cape Inutabu on [[Tokunoshima]], an island in the [[Amami Islands]] of [[Kagoshima Prefecture]], to commemorate the lives lost in Operation Ten-Go. In October 1974, [[Leiji Matsumoto]] created a new television series, ''[[Space Battleship Yamato]]'', about rebuilding the battleship as a starship and its interstellar quest to save Earth. The series was a huge success, spawning eight feature films and four more TV series, the most recent of which was released in 2017. The series popularised the [[space opera]]. As post-war Japanese tried to redefine the purpose of their lives, ''Yamato'' became a symbol of heroism and of their desire to regain a sense of masculinity after their country's defeat in the war.<ref>Mizuno (2007), pp. 106, 110\u2013111, 121\u2013122.</ref><ref>Levi (1998), p. 72.</ref> Brought to the United States as ''[[Star Blazers]]'', the animated series proved popular and established a foundation for anime in the North American entertainment market.<ref>Wright (2009), p. 99.</ref> The motif in ''Space Battleship Yamato'' was repeated in [[The Silent Service|''Silent Service'']], a popular manga and anime that explores issues of nuclear weapons and the Japan\u2013US relationship.

She and her [[sister ship]], {{ship|Japanese battleship|Musashi||2}}, were the heaviest and most powerfully armed battleships ever constructed, displacing 72,800&nbsp;tonnes at full load and armed with nine {{convert|46|cm|in|1|abbr=on}} [[40 cm/45 Type 94 naval gun|Type 94]] main guns, which were the largest guns ever mounted on a warship.\n\nNamed after the ancient Japanese [[Yamato Province]], ''Yamato'' was designed to counter the numerically superior battleship fleet of the [[United States]], Japan's main rival in the [[Pacific Theatre of World War II|Pacific]]. She was laid down in 1937 and formally commissioned a week after the [[Pearl Harbor attack]] in late 1941. Throughout 1942, she served as the [[flagship]] of the [[Combined Fleet]], and in June 1942 Admiral [[Isoroku Yamamoto]] directed the fleet from her bridge during the [[Battle of Midway]], a disastrous defeat for Japan. ''Musashi'' took over as the Combined Fleet flagship in early 1943, and ''Yamato'' spent the rest of the year, and much of 1944, moving between the major Japanese naval bases of [[Chuuk Lagoon|Truk]] and [[Kure, Hiroshima|Kure]] in response to American threats. Although present at the [[Battle of the Philippine Sea]] in June 1944, she played no part in the battle.\n\nThe only time ''Yamato'' fired her main guns at enemy surface targets was in October 1944, when she was sent to engage American forces invading the Philippines during the [[Battle of Leyte Gulf]]. While threatening to sink American troop transports, they encountered a light [[escort carrier]] group of the U.S. Navy's [[Task Force 77 (United States Navy)|Task Force 77]], \"Taffy 3\", in the [[Battle off Samar]]. The Japanese turned back after American air attacks convinced them they were engaging a powerful US carrier fleet.\n\nDuring 1944, the balance of naval power in the Pacific decisively turned against Japan, and by early 1945, its fleet was much depleted and badly hobbled by critical fuel shortages in the home islands. In a desperate attempt to slow the Allied advance, ''Yamato'' was dispatched on [[Operation Ten-Go|a one-way mission]] to [[Okinawa]] in April 1945, with orders to beach herself and fight until destroyed, thus protecting the island. The task force was spotted south of [[Kyushu]] by US submarines and aircraft, and on 7 April 1945 she was sunk by American carrier-based bombers and torpedo bombers with the loss of most of her crew.\n\n==Design and construction==\n{{Main|Yamato-class battleship}}\nDuring the 1930s the Japanese government adopted an [[ultranationalist]] militancy with a view to greatly expand the [[Japanese Empire]].<ref>Willmott (2000), p. 32.</ref> Japan withdrew from the [[League of Nations]] in 1934, renouncing its treaty obligations.<ref>Garzke and Dulin (1985), p. 44.</ref> After withdrawing from the [[Washington Naval Treaty]], which limited the size and power of capital ships, the Imperial Japanese Navy began their design of the new [[Yamato-class battleship|''Yamato'' class]] of heavy battleships.

Further confirmation of Japanese intentions came around 20:00 when the Surface Special Attack Force, navigating the [[Bungo Strait]], was spotted by the American submarines {{USS|Threadfin|SS-410|2}} and {{USS|Hackleback|SS-295|2}}. Both reported ''Yamato''{{'}}s position to the main [[Fast Carrier Task Force|American carrier strike force]],<ref name=\"jackson128\" /><ref name=\"G&D60\" /> but neither could attack because of the speed of the Japanese ships\u2014{{convert|22|knot|mph km/h}}\u2014and their extreme [[zigzag]]ging.<ref name=\"G&D60\" />\n\nThe Allied forces around Okinawa braced for an assault. Admiral [[Raymond Spruance]] ordered six battleships already engaged in shore bombardment in the sector to prepare for surface action against ''Yamato''.

''Yamato'' obtained her first radar contact with aircraft at 10:00; an hour later, American [[Grumman F6F Hellcat|F6F Hellcat]] fighters appeared overhead to deal with any Japanese aircraft that might appear. None did.<ref name=\"G&D61\">Garzke and Dulin (1985), pp. 60\u201361.</ref>{{refn|The poor quality of the Japanese naval radar during World War II meant that only large groups of planes could be detected.

The Surface Special Attack Force increased speed to {{convert|24|knot|mph km/h}}, and following standard Japanese anti-aircraft defensive measures, the destroyers began circling ''Yamato''. The first aircraft swooped in to attack at 12:37. ''Yahagi'' turned and raced away at {{convert|35|knot|mph km/h}} in an attempt to draw off some of the attackers; it drew off only an insignificant number. ''Yamato'' was not hit for four minutes, but at 12:41 two bombs obliterated two of her triple 25&nbsp;mm anti-aircraft mounts and blew a hole in the deck. A third bomb then destroyed her radar room and the starboard aft 127&nbsp;mm mount. At 12:45 a single torpedo struck ''Yamato'' far forward on her port side, sending shock waves throughout the ship. At 12:46, another two bombs struck the battleship's port side, one slightly ahead of the aft 155&nbsp;mm centreline turret and the other right on top of the gun. These caused a great deal of damage to the turret and its magazines; only one man survived.<ref name=\"G&D61\" />{{refn|This account is based on Garzke and Dulin's ''Battleships: Axis and Neutral Battleships in World War II''. Other works generally agree, although the exact timings of events can vary between sources.<ref name=\"G&D54\" />|group=N}} Because many of the ship's crew who did not go down with the vessel were killed by strafing aircraft as they swam in the oily water, the details are uncertain, but authors Garzke and Dulin record that little damage was caused.<ref name=\"G&D61\" /> Shortly afterward, up to three more torpedoes struck ''Yamato''. Two impacts, on the port side near the [[engine room]] and on one of the [[boiler]] rooms, are confirmed; the third is disputed but is regarded by Garzke and Dulin as probable because it would explain the reported flooding in ''Yamato''{{'}}s auxiliary steering room. The attack ended around 12:47, leaving the battleship [[List (watercraft)|listing]] {{formatnum:5\u20136}}\u00b0 to port; counterflooding\u2014deliberately flooding compartments on the other side of the ship\u2014reduced the list to {{formatnum:1}}\u00b0. One boiler room had been disabled, slightly reducing ''Yamato''{{'}}s top speed, and strafing had incapacitated many of the gun crews who manned ''Yamato''{{'}}s unprotected 25&nbsp;mm anti-aircraft weapons, sharply curtailing their effectiveness.<ref name=\"G&D61\" />\n\n[[File:Yamato damaged 7 apr 1945.jpg|thumb|alt=A large area of ocean with a warship in the middle distance.

In a coordinated strike, dive bombers flew high overhead to begin their runs while torpedo bombers approached from all directions at just above sea level. Overwhelmed by the number of targets, the battleship's anti-aircraft guns were ineffective, and the Japanese tried desperate measures to break up the attack. ''Yamato''{{'}}s main guns were loaded with [[Beehive (anti-aircraft shell)|''Beehive'']] shells fused to explode one second after firing\u2014a mere {{convert|1000|m|ft|abbr=on}} from the ship\u2014but these had little effect. Three or four torpedoes struck the battleship on the port side and one to starboard. Three hits, close together on the port side, are confirmed: one struck a fire room that had already been hit, one impacted a different fire room, and the third hit the hull adjacent to a damaged outboard engine room, increasing the water flow into that space and possibly flooding nearby locations. The fourth hit, unconfirmed, may have struck aft of the third; Garzke and Dulin believe this would explain the rapid flooding reported in that location.<ref>Garzke and Dulin (1985), pp. 62\u201363.</ref> This attack left ''Yamato'' in a perilous position, listing {{formatnum:15\u201318}}\u00b0 to port. Counterflooding of all remaining starboard void spaces lessened this to {{formatnum:10}}\u00b0, but further correction would have required repairs or flooding the starboard engine and fire rooms. Although the battleship was not yet in danger of sinking, the list meant the main battery was unable to fire and her speed was limited to {{convert|18|knots}}.<ref>Garzke and Dulin (1985), p. 63.</ref>\n\nThe third and most damaging attack developed at about 13:40. At least four bombs hit the ship's superstructure and caused heavy casualties among her 25&nbsp;mm anti-aircraft gun crews. Many near misses drove in her outer plating, compromising her defense against torpedoes. Most serious were four more torpedo impacts. Three exploded on the port side, increasing water flow into the port inner engine room and flooding yet another fire room and the steering gear room. With the auxiliary steering room already under water, the ship lost maneuverability and became stuck in a starboard turn. The fourth torpedo most likely hit the starboard outer engine room, which, along with three other rooms on the starboard side, was being counterflooded to reduce the port list. The torpedo strike accelerated the rate of flooding and trapped many crewmen.<ref>Garzke and Dulin (1985), pp. 64\u201365.</ref>\n\n[[File:Yamato explosion.jpg|thumb|left|upright|alt=A view of the ocean stretching to the horizon with the silhouette of a distant small warship visible to the left.

The battleships represented the epitome of Imperial Japanese naval engineering, and because of their size, speed, and power, visibly embodied Japan's determination and readiness to defend its interests against the [[Western Powers#Colonial \"West\"|Western Powers]] and the United States in particular.

In October 1974, [[Leiji Matsumoto]] created a new television series, ''[[Space Battleship Yamato]]'', about rebuilding the battleship as a starship and its interstellar quest to save Earth. The series was a huge success, spawning eight feature films and four more TV series, the most recent of which was released in 2017. The series popularised the [[space opera]].
