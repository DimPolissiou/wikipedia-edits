Alongside the bishop's [[Episcopal see|see]], the canonical settlement [[Kaptol, Zagreb|Kaptol]] developed north of [[Zagreb Cathedral]], as did the fortified settlement [[Gradec, Zagreb|Gradec]] on the neighbouring hill; the border between the two being the Medve\u0161\u010dak stream. Today the latter is Zagreb's Upper Town ([[Gornji Grad \u2013 Medve\u0161\u010dak|Gornji Grad]]) and is one of the best preserved urban nuclei in [[Croatia]]. Both settlements came under [[Tatars|Tatar]] attack in 1242. As a sign of gratitude for offering him a safe haven from the [[Tatars]] the Croatian and Hungarian [[B\u00e9la IV of Hungary|King Bela IV]] bestowed Gradec with a [[Golden Bull of 1242|Golden Bull]], which offered its citizens exemption from county rule and autonomy, as well as its own [[judiciary|judicial system]].\n\n===16th to 18th centuries===\nThere were numerous connections between the Kaptol diocese and the free sovereign town of Gradec for both economic and political reasons, but they weren't known as an integrated city, even as Zagreb became the political centre and, representing both Croatia, [[Slavonia]] and [[Dalmatia]], first convened at Gradec. Zagreb was chosen as the seat of the [[Ban of Croatia]] in 1621 under ban [[Nikola Frankopan]].\n\nAt the invitation of the [[Croatian Parliament]], the [[Society of Jesus|Jesuits]] came to Zagreb and built the first [[grammar school]], the [[Catherine of Alexandria|St. Catherine's]] Church and monastery. In 1669, they founded an academy where philosophy, theology and law were taught, the forerunner of today's [[University of Zagreb]].\n\nDuring the 17th and 18th centuries, Zagreb was badly devastated by fire and [[Bubonic plague|the plague]]. In 1776, the royal council (government) moved from [[Vara\u017edin]] to Zagreb and during the reign of [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor|Joseph II]] Zagreb became the headquarters of the [[Vara\u017edin]] and [[Karlovac]] general command.<ref name=\"HRT\">{{cite web\n|url=http://www.hrt.hr/arhiv/hrvati_u_svijetu/upoznajte_hrvatsku/03_glavni_grad_hrvatske/zagreb_eng.html\n|title=The city of Zagreb\n|work=hrt.hr\n|publisher=[[Croatian Radiotelevision]]\n|accessdate=2 July 2006\n|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070117124718/http://www.hrt.hr/arhiv/hrvati_u_svijetu/upoznajte_hrvatsku/03_glavni_grad_hrvatske/zagreb_eng.html <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate= 17 January 2007}}</ref>\n\n===19th to mid-20th century===\n\n<!--''Political history is missing'' (March 2013)-->\nIn the 19th century, Zagreb was the centre of the [[Illyrian movement|Croatian National Revival]] and saw the erection of important cultural and historic institutions.\nIn 1850, the town was united under its first [[List of mayors of Zagreb|mayor]] \u2013 [[Janko Kamauf]].<ref name=\"HRT\"/>\n\nThe first [[rail transport|railway]] line to connect Zagreb with [[Zidani Most]] and [[Sisak]] was opened in 1862 and in 1863 Zagreb received a [[gasworks]].

Before World War I, the city expanded and neighbourhoods like [[Stara Pe\u0161\u010denica]] in the east and [[\u010crnomerec]] in the west were created. After the war, [[working class|working-class]] districts such as [[Trnje, Zagreb|Trnje]] emerged between the railway and the [[Sava]], whereas the construction of residential districts on the hills of the southern slopes of [[Medvednica]] was completed [[Interwar period|between the two World Wars]].\n\nIn the 1920s, the population of Zagreb increased by 70 percent \u2013 the largest demographic boom in the history of the town. In 1926, the first [[radio broadcasting|radio station]] in the region began broadcasting from Zagreb, and in 1947 the [[Zagreb Fair]] was opened.<ref name=\"HRT\"/>\n\nDuring [[World War II]], Zagreb became the capital of the [[Independent State of Croatia]], which was backed by [[Nazi Germany]] and the [[Fascism in Italy|Italians]]. The history of [[Zagreb in World War II]] became rife with incidents of regime terror and resistance sabotage, and the [[Usta\u0161a]] regime had thousands of people executed during the war in and near the city. The city was taken by the [[Partisans (Yugoslavia)|Partisans]] at the end of the war.

Zagreb has four separate [[season]]s. Summers are generally warm, sometimes hot. In late May it gets significantly warmer, temperatures start rising and it is often pleasant with frequent afternoon and evening thunderstorms. Heatwaves can occur but are short-lived. Temperatures rise above {{convert|30|C}} on an average 14.6 days each summer. Rainfall is abundant in the summertime and it continues to be in autumn as well. With 840&nbsp;mm of precipitation per year, Zagreb is Europe's 9th wettest capital, receiving less precipitation than Luxembourg but more than [[Brussels]], [[Paris]] and [[London]]. [[Autumn]] in its early stages is often mild and sunny with occasional episodes of rain. Autumn is characterised by an increase in rainy days as well as by temperature averages that steadily fall towards the end of the season. Morning [[fog]] is common from mid-October to January, with northern city districts at the foothills of the [[Medvednica]] mountain as well as those districts along the [[Sava]] river being more prone to all-day fog accumulation. Winters are relatively cold with a precipitation decrease pattern. February is the driest month, averaging 39&nbsp;mm of precipitation. On average there are 29 days with snowfall, with first snow usually falling in early December. However, in recent years, the number of snowy days has decreased sharply. Springs are generally mild and pleasant with frequent weather changes and are windier than other seasons. Sometimes cold spells can occur, mostly in its early stages. The average daily mean temperature in the winter is around {{convert|1|\u00b0C}} (from December to February) and the average temperature in the summer is {{convert|22.0|C|1}}.<ref name= normals

The Sava and the [[Kupa (river)|Kupa]] valleys are to the south of Zagreb, and the region of [[Hrvatsko Zagorje]] is located on the other (northern) side of the Medvednica hill. In mid-January 2005, Sljeme held its first [[FIS Alpine World Ski Championships|World Ski Championship tournament]].\n\nFrom the summit, weather permitting, the vista reaches as far as [[Velebit]] Range along Croatia's rocky northern coast, as well as the snow-capped peaks of the towering [[Julian Alps]] in neighbouring [[Slovenia]]. There are several lodging villages, offering accommodation and restaurants for hikers. Skiers visit Sljeme, which has four ski-runs, three ski-lifts and a chairlift.\n\nThe old [[Medvedgrad]], a recently restored medieval [[wikt:Special:Search/burg|burg]] was built in the 13th century on Medvednica hill.

Since the end of the [[History of Croatia|war]], it has attracted close to a million visitors annually, mainly from [[Austria]], [[Germany]] and [[Italy]], and in recent years many tourists from far east (South Korea, Japan, China, and last two years, from India). It has become an important tourist destination, not only in Croatia, but considering the whole region of southeastern Europe. There are many interesting sights and happenings for tourists to attend in Zagreb, for example, the two statues of Saint George, one at the [[Republic of Croatia Square]], the other at [[Stone Gate|Kamenita vrata]], where the image of Virgin Mary is said to be only thing that hasn't burned in the 17th-century fire. Also, there is an art installation starting in Bogovi\u0107eva street, called [[Nine Views]]. Most people don't know what the statue \"Prizemljeno Sunce\" (The Grounded Sun) is for, and just scrawl graffiti or signatures on it, but it's actually the Sun scaled down, with many planets situated all over Zagreb in scale with the Sun. There are also many festivals and events throughout the year, which made Zagreb a year-round tourist destination for many years already.\n\nThe historical part of the city to the north of [[Ban Jela\u010di\u0107 Square]] is composed of the [[Gradec, Zagreb|Gornji Grad]] and [[Kaptol, Zagreb|Kaptol]], a medieval urban complex of churches, palaces, museums, galleries and government buildings that are popular with tourists on sightseeing tours. The historic district can be reached on foot, starting from [[Jela\u010di\u0107 Square]], the centre of Zagreb, or by a [[funicular]] on nearby Tomi\u0107eva Street. Each Saturday, (from April till the end of September), on [[St. Mark's Square, Zagreb|St. Mark's Square]] in the [[Gradec, Zagreb|Upper town]], tourists can meet members of the Order of The Silver Dragon (Red Srebrnog Zmaja), who reenact famous historical conflicts between [[Gradec, Zagreb County|Gradec]] and [[Kaptol, Zagreb|Kaptol]]. It's a great opportunity for all visitors to take photographs of authentic and fully functional historical replicas of medieval armour.\n\nIn 2010 more than 600,000<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.poslovni.hr/vijesti/grad-zagreb-u-2010-broj-turistickih-dolazaka-veci-za-4-posto-168991.aspx |title=Broj turistickih dolazaka|publisher=poslovni.hr|accessdate=12 January 2012}}</ref> tourists visited the city, with a 10%<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kigo.hr/tekst/11098.html |title=Broj turista najvise porastao u Zagrebu |publisher=kigo.hr |accessdate=12 January 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130301124403/http://www.kigo.hr/tekst/11098.html |archivedate=1 March 2013}}</ref> increase seen in 2011.

The number of cars in the city centre is rising by 4% every year and current traffic levels require a widening of the road infrastructure. A particular problem is [[Ilica (street)|Ilica]] Street, which has high amounts of both car, tram and pedestrian traffic. Any widening of this street would take some space from the pedestrians. The tunnels would triple the downtown road capacity and allow the cars to travel at {{convert|50|km/h|abbr=on}} at [[peak hour]]. The seven tunnels would also help solve the problem of the unfinished [[Sljeme tunnel]], which has been a citywide nuisance for a long time.\n\nThe proposed tunnels would have an underground interchange near Jabukovac street in the hills north of the city centre. Three tunnels (one of which would have two tubes) would connect the future Jabukovac interchange with the city centre. Another tunnel would connect Jabukovac to [[Gup\u010deva zvijezda]], one would go to Zelengaj north of Britanski square and the third one would go to Von\u010dinina Street, about {{convert|1|km|mi|abbr=on}} east of Jabukovac. There would also be a tunnel connecting Dra\u0161kovi\u0107eva Street to [[Ribnjak, Zagreb]], eliminating the current long and often congested bypass which uses smaller streets near [[\u017drtava Fa\u0161izma Square]].\n\nShould the proposal be accepted, it would take three years to build the tunnels.<ref name=tuneli>{{cite web\n|url=http://www.sutra.hr/gradski-ritam/tunelima-kroz-centar-zagreba\n|title=Tunelima kroz centar Zagreba\n|accessdate=27 November 2007\n|last=\u0160imunovi\u0107\n|first=Damjan\n|date=24 November 2007\n|work=Sutra.hr\n|language=Croatian\n}}</ref>\n -->\n\n====Public transportation====\n[[File:Estaci\u00f3n Principal de FF.CC., Zagreb, Croacia, 2014-04-20, DD 03.JPG|thumb|right|[[Zagreb Glavni kolodvor|Main Railway Station]]]]\n[[File:Sede de los Ferrocarriles Croatas, Zagreb, Croacia, 2014-04-13, DD 01.JPG|thumb|right|[[Croatian Railways|Croatian Railways headquarters]]]]\n\n[[File:ZET tram&bus.jpg|thumb|right|[[Zagreba\u010dki elektri\u010dni tramvaj|ZET]] tram and city bus]]\n[[File:H\u017d Class 6112 1.JPG|thumb|right|[[H\u017d series 6112|Newest model]] of the Zagreb city trains system]]\n[[Public transport]]ation in the city is organised in several layers: the inner parts of the city are mostly covered by [[tram]]s, the outer city areas and closer suburbs are linked with [[bus]]es and rapid transit [[Zagreb Commuter Rail|commuter rail]].\n\nThe public transportation company [[Zagreba\u010dki elektri\u010dni tramvaj|ZET]] (''Zagreba\u010dki elektri\u010dni tramvaj'', Zagreb Electric Tram) operates trams, all inner bus lines, and the most of the suburban bus lines, and it is subsidised by the city council.\n\nThe national rail operator [[Croatian Railways]] (''Hrvatske \u017eeljeznice'', H\u017d) runs a network of urban and suburban train lines in the metropolitan Zagreb area, and is a [[government-owned corporation]].\n\nThe [[funicular]] (''uspinja\u010da'') in the historic part of the city is a [[tourist attraction]].\n\n[[Taxicab|Taxi]] market has been liberalized in early 2018<ref>{{cite web|url=https://vlada.gov.hr/vijesti/ministar-butkovic-novim-zakonom-o-prijevozu-u-cestovnom-prometu-jeftiniji-i-dostupniji-taksi-za-sve-gradjane/23630 |title=Ministar Butkovi\u0107: Novim Zakonom o prijevozu u cestovnom prometu jeftiniji i dostupniji taksi za sve gra\u0111ane |publisher=Government of the Republic of Croatia }}</ref> and numerous transport companies have been allowed to enter the market; consequently, the prices significantly dropped whereas the service was immensely improved so the popularity of taxis in Zagreb has been increasing from then onwards.\n\n=====Tram network=====\n{{main|Trams in Zagreb}}\nZagreb has an extensive [[tram]] network with 15-day and 4 night lines covering much of the inner- and middle-suburbs of the city.

Alongside the bishop's [[Episcopal see|see]], the canonical settlement [[Kaptol, Zagreb|Kaptol]] developed north of [[Zagreb Cathedral]], as did the fortified settlement [[Gradec, Zagreb|Gradec]] on the neighbouring hill; the border between the two being the Medve\u0161\u010dak stream. Today the latter is Zagreb's Upper Town ([[Gornji Grad \u2013 Medve\u0161\u010dak|Gornji Grad]]) and is one of the best preserved urban nuclei in [[Croatia]]. Both settlements came under [[Tatars|Tatar]] attack in 1242. As a sign of gratitude for offering him a safe haven from the [[Tatars]] the Croatian and Hungarian [[B\u00e9la IV of Hungary|King Bela IV]] bestowed Gradec with a [[Golden Bull of 1242|Golden Bull]], which offered its citizens exemption from county rule and autonomy, as well as its own [[judiciary|judicial system]].\n\n===16th to 18th centuries===\nThere were numerous connections between the Kaptol diocese and the free sovereign town of Gradec for both economic and political reasons, but they weren't known as an integrated city, even as Zagreb became the political centre and, representing both Croatia, [[Slavonia]] and [[Dalmatia]], first convened at Gradec. Zagreb was chosen as the seat of the [[Ban of Croatia]] in 1621 under ban [[Nikola Frankopan]].\n\nAt the invitation of the [[Croatian Parliament]], the [[Society of Jesus|Jesuits]] came to Zagreb and built the first [[grammar school]], the [[Catherine of Alexandria|St. Catherine's]] Church and monastery. In 1669, they founded an academy where philosophy, theology and law were taught, the forerunner of today's [[University of Zagreb]].\n\nDuring the 17th and 18th centuries, Zagreb was badly devastated by fire and [[Bubonic plague|the plague]]. In 1776, the royal council (government) moved from [[Vara\u017edin]] to Zagreb and during the reign of [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor|Joseph II]] Zagreb became the headquarters of the [[Vara\u017edin]] and [[Karlovac]] general command.<ref name=\"HRT\">{{cite web\n|url=http://www.hrt.hr/arhiv/hrvati_u_svijetu/upoznajte_hrvatsku/03_glavni_grad_hrvatske/zagreb_eng.html\n|title=The city of Zagreb\n|work=hrt.hr\n|publisher=[[Croatian Radiotelevision]]\n|accessdate=2 July 2006\n|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070117124718/http://www.hrt.hr/arhiv/hrvati_u_svijetu/upoznajte_hrvatsku/03_glavni_grad_hrvatske/zagreb_eng.html <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate= 17 January 2007}}</ref>\n\n===19th to mid-20th century===\n\n<!--''Political history is missing'' (March 2013)-->\nIn the 19th century, Zagreb was the centre of the [[Illyrian movement|Croatian National Revival]] and saw the erection of important cultural and historic institutions.\nIn 1850, the town was united under its first [[List of mayors of Zagreb|mayor]] \u2013 [[Janko Kamauf]].<ref name=\"HRT\"/>\n\nThe first [[rail transport|railway]] line to connect Zagreb with [[Zidani Most]] and [[Sisak]] was opened in 1862 and in 1863 Zagreb received a [[gasworks]].

In 1926, the first [[radio broadcasting|radio station]] in the region began broadcasting from Zagreb, and in 1947 the [[Zagreb Fair]] was opened.<ref name=\"HRT\"/>\n\nDuring [[World War II]], Zagreb became the capital of the [[Independent State of Croatia]], which was backed by [[Nazi Germany]] and the [[Fascism in Italy|Italians]]. The history of [[Zagreb in World War II]] became rife with incidents of regime terror and resistance sabotage, and the [[Usta\u0161a]] regime had thousands of people executed during the war in and near the city. The city was taken by the [[Partisans (Yugoslavia)|Partisans]] at the end of the war. From 1945 until 1990, Zagreb was the capital of the [[Socialist Republic of Croatia]], one of the six constituent socialist republics of the [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]].\n\n===Modern Zagreb===\n[[File:Zagreb - 2015 - panoramio (5).jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.9|[[Ban Jela\u010di\u0107 Square]]]]\n[[File:19-06-16-Zagreb-DJI_0181.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.9|King Tomislav Square]]\nThe area between the railway and the [[Sava]] river witnessed a new construction boom after [[World War II]]. After the mid-1950s, construction of new residential areas south of the [[Sava]] river began, resulting in [[Novi Zagreb]] (Croatian for ''New Zagreb''), originally called \"Ju\u017eni Zagreb\" (Southern Zagreb).<ref name=juzni_zagreb>{{cite journal |url=http://www.zarez.hr/222/z_socijalna.html |title=O imaginarnim kartama Ju\u017enog= Novog Zagreba |journal=Zarez |last=Mareti\u0107 |first=Mirko |issue=\u2116 222 |date=10 January 2008 |accessdate=25 February 2009  |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090515163924/http://www.zarez.hr/222/z_socijalna.html |archive-date=15 May 2009 |language=Croatian}}</ref> \nToday Novi Zagreb is divided in two [[city districts]]: [[Novi Zagreb-zapad]] ([[Novi Zagreb-zapad|West\nNovi Zagreb]]) and [[Novi Zagreb-istok]] ([[Novi Zagreb-istok|East Novi Zagreb]])\n\nThe city also expanded westward and eastward, incorporating [[Dubrava, Zagreb|Dubrava]], Podsused, [[Jarun]], [[Blato, Zagreb|Blato]] and other settlements.\nThe cargo railway hub and the [[international airport]] [[Zagreb Airport|Pleso]] were built south of the [[Sava]] river. The largest [[industrial district|industrial zone]] (\u017ditnjak) in the south-eastern part of the city represents an extension of the industrial zones on the eastern outskirts of the city, between the [[Sava]] and the Prigorje region. Zagreb also hosted the [[1987 Summer Universiade|Summer Universiade]] in 1987.<ref name=\"HRT\"/>\n\nDuring the 1991\u20131995 [[Croatian War of Independence]], it was a scene of some [[Battle of the Barracks|sporadic fighting]] surrounding its [[Yugoslav People's Army|JNA]] [[barracks|army barracks]], but escaped major damage. In May 1995, it was targeted by Serb [[rocket artillery]] in two [[Zagreb rocket attacks|rocket attacks]] which killed seven civilians.\n\nAn urbanised area connects Zagreb with the surrounding towns of [[Zapre\u0161i\u0107]], [[Samobor]], [[Dugo Selo]] and [[Velika Gorica]]. Sesvete was the first and the closest area to become a part of the [[urban agglomeration|agglomeration]] and is already included in the City of Zagreb for administrative purposes and now forms the easternmost city district.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dzs.hr/Eng/censuses/Census2001/Popis/E01_01_03/e01_01_03_zup22.html |title=SAS Output |publisher=Dzs.hr |accessdate=15 September 2011}}</ref>\n\nIn 2020 the city was hit by a 5.5 magnitude earthquake. Various buildings in the historic downtown area were damaged. The city's iconic cathedral lost the cross off of one of its towers. This earthquake was the strongest one since the one that occurred 140 years prior in 1880.\n\n===Area and population development===\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin: 1em auto 1em auto;\" |+ '''Cells left-aligned, table centred'''\n|-\n! style=\"width:50px;\"|Year\n! style=\"width:80px;\"|Area <br/>(km<sup>2</sup>)\n! style=\"width:80px;\"|Population <br/>(within city limits at that time)\n! style=\"width:80px;\"|Population <br/>(within today's city limits)\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:center;\"|1368\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|2,810<ref group=\"nb\" name=\"ex02\">from the household census</ref>\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:center;\"|1742\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|3.33\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|5,600<ref group=\"nb\" name=\"ex02\"/>\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:center;\"|1805\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|3.33\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|7,706<ref group=\"nb\">population census without clergy and nobility</ref>(~11 000 in total)\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:center;\"|1850\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|25.4\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|16,036\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:center;\"|1857\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|25.4\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|16,657\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|48,266\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:center;\"|1869\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|25.4\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|19,857\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|54,761\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:center;\"|1880\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|25.4\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|30,830\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|67,188\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:center;\"|1890\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|25.4\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|40,268\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|82,848\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:center;\"|1900\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|64.37\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|61,002\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|111,565\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:center;\"|1910\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|64.37\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|79,038\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|136,351\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:center;\"|1921\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|64.37\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|108,674\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|167,765\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:center;\"|1931\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|64.37\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|185,581\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|258,024\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:center;\"|1948\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|74.99\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|279,623\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|356,529\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:center;\"|1953\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|235.74\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|350,829\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|393,919\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:center;\"|1961\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|495.60\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|430,802\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|478,076\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:center;\"|1971\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|497.95\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|602,205\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|629,896\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:center;\"|1981\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|1,261.54\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|768,700\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|723,065\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:center;\"|1991\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|1,715.55\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|933,914\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|777,826\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:center;\"|2001\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|641.36\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|779,145\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|779,145\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:center;\"|2011\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|641.36\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|792,875\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|792,875\n|-\n|colspan=5 |<small>The data in column 3 refers to the population in the city borders as of the census in question.

Zagreb has four separate [[season]]s. Summers are generally warm, sometimes hot. In late May it gets significantly warmer, temperatures start rising and it is often pleasant with frequent afternoon and evening thunderstorms. Heatwaves can occur but are short-lived. Temperatures rise above {{convert|30|C}} on an average 14.6 days each summer. Rainfall is abundant in the summertime and it continues to be in autumn as well. With 840&nbsp;mm of precipitation per year, Zagreb is Europe's 9th wettest capital, receiving less precipitation than Luxembourg but more than [[Brussels]], [[Paris]] and [[London]]. [[Autumn]] in its early stages is often mild and sunny with occasional episodes of rain. Autumn is characterised by an increase in rainy days as well as by temperature averages that steadily fall towards the end of the season. Morning [[fog]] is common from mid-October to January, with northern city districts at the foothills of the [[Medvednica]] mountain as well as those districts along the [[Sava]] river being more prone to all-day fog accumulation. Winters are relatively cold with a precipitation decrease pattern. February is the driest month, averaging 39&nbsp;mm of precipitation. On average there are 29 days with snowfall, with first snow usually falling in early December. However, in recent years, the number of snowy days has decreased sharply. Springs are generally mild and pleasant with frequent weather changes and are windier than other seasons. Sometimes cold spells can occur, mostly in its early stages. The average daily mean temperature in the winter is around {{convert|1|\u00b0C}} (from December to February) and the average temperature in the summer is {{convert|22.0|C|1}}.<ref name= normals

The Sava and the [[Kupa (river)|Kupa]] valleys are to the south of Zagreb, and the region of [[Hrvatsko Zagorje]] is located on the other (northern) side of the Medvednica hill. In mid-January 2005, Sljeme held its first [[FIS Alpine World Ski Championships|World Ski Championship tournament]].\n\nFrom the summit, weather permitting, the vista reaches as far as [[Velebit]] Range along Croatia's rocky northern coast, as well as the snow-capped peaks of the towering [[Julian Alps]] in neighbouring [[Slovenia]]. There are several lodging villages, offering accommodation and restaurants for hikers. Skiers visit Sljeme, which has four ski-runs, three ski-lifts and a chairlift.\n\nThe old [[Medvedgrad]], a recently restored medieval [[wikt:Special:Search/burg|burg]] was built in the 13th century on Medvednica hill. It overlooks the western part of the city and also hosts the ''Shrine of the Homeland'', a memorial with an [[eternal flame]], where Croatia pays reverence to all its heroes fallen for [[homeland]] in its history, customarily on [[Public holiday|national holiday]]s. The ruined medieval fortress [[Susedgrad]] is located on far-western side of Medvednica hill. It has been abandoned since the early 17th century, but it is visited during the year.\n\nZagreb occasionally experiences earthquakes, due to the proximity of [[\u017dumberak]]-[[Medvednica]] fault zone.<ref>[http://www2.ogs.trieste.it/gngts/gngts/convegniprecedenti/2008/riassunti/1.1/11-toml.pdf SEISMOGENIC ZONES OF NORTHWESTERN CROATIA] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160206110700/http://www2.ogs.trieste.it/gngts/gngts/convegniprecedenti/2008/riassunti/1.1/11-toml.pdf |date=6 February 2016 }} GNGTS 2008</ref> It's classified as an area of high seismic activity.<ref name=\"embassy earthquake\">{{cite web|url=http://zagreb.usembassy.gov/service/special-consular-services/emergency-and-medical-issues/earthquake.html|title=Earthquake \u2013 Zagreb, Croatia \u2013 Embassy of the United States|work=usembassy.gov|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160206090402/http://zagreb.usembassy.gov/service/special-consular-services/emergency-and-medical-issues/earthquake.html|archivedate=6 February 2016}}</ref> The area around Medvednica was the epicentre of the [[1880 Zagreb earthquake]] (magnitude 6.3), and the area is known for occasional landslide threatening houses in the area.<ref name=\"landslide survey croatian\">{{cite web|url=http://www.hgi-cgs.hr/zagreb_potresi.html|title=Potresi na zagreba\u010dkom podru\u010dju|last=dpuljic|work=hgi-cgs.hr}}</ref> The proximity of strong seismic sources presents a real danger of strong earthquakes.<ref name=\"landslide survey croatian\"/> Croatian Chief of [[Office of Emergency Management]] Pavle Kalini\u0107 stated Zagreb experiences around 400 earthquakes a year, most of them being imperceptible.

Since the end of the [[History of Croatia|war]], it has attracted close to a million visitors annually, mainly from [[Austria]], [[Germany]] and [[Italy]], and in recent years many tourists from far east (South Korea, Japan, China, and last two years, from India). It has become an important tourist destination, not only in Croatia, but considering the whole region of southeastern Europe. There are many interesting sights and happenings for tourists to attend in Zagreb, for example, the two statues of Saint George, one at the [[Republic of Croatia Square]], the other at [[Stone Gate|Kamenita vrata]], where the image of Virgin Mary is said to be only thing that hasn't burned in the 17th-century fire. Also, there is an art installation starting in Bogovi\u0107eva street, called [[Nine Views]]. Most people don't know what the statue \"Prizemljeno Sunce\" (The Grounded Sun) is for, and just scrawl graffiti or signatures on it, but it's actually the Sun scaled down, with many planets situated all over Zagreb in scale with the Sun. There are also many festivals and events throughout the year, which made Zagreb a year-round tourist destination for many years already.\n\nThe historical part of the city to the north of [[Ban Jela\u010di\u0107 Square]] is composed of the [[Gradec, Zagreb|Gornji Grad]] and [[Kaptol, Zagreb|Kaptol]], a medieval urban complex of churches, palaces, museums, galleries and government buildings that are popular with tourists on sightseeing tours. The historic district can be reached on foot, starting from [[Jela\u010di\u0107 Square]], the centre of Zagreb, or by a [[funicular]] on nearby Tomi\u0107eva Street. Each Saturday, (from April till the end of September), on [[St. Mark's Square, Zagreb|St. Mark's Square]] in the [[Gradec, Zagreb|Upper town]], tourists can meet members of the Order of The Silver Dragon (Red Srebrnog Zmaja), who reenact famous historical conflicts between [[Gradec, Zagreb County|Gradec]] and [[Kaptol, Zagreb|Kaptol]]. It's a great opportunity for all visitors to take photographs of authentic and fully functional historical replicas of medieval armour.\n\nIn 2010 more than 600,000<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.poslovni.hr/vijesti/grad-zagreb-u-2010-broj-turistickih-dolazaka-veci-za-4-posto-168991.aspx |title=Broj turistickih dolazaka|publisher=poslovni.hr|accessdate=12 January 2012}}</ref> tourists visited the city, with a 10%<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kigo.hr/tekst/11098.html |title=Broj turista najvise porastao u Zagrebu |publisher=kigo.hr |accessdate=12 January 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130301124403/http://www.kigo.hr/tekst/11098.html |archivedate=1 March 2013}}</ref> increase seen in 2011.

The number of cars in the city centre is rising by 4% every year and current traffic levels require a widening of the road infrastructure. A particular problem is [[Ilica (street)|Ilica]] Street, which has high amounts of both car, tram and pedestrian traffic. Any widening of this street would take some space from the pedestrians. The tunnels would triple the downtown road capacity and allow the cars to travel at {{convert|50|km/h|abbr=on}} at [[peak hour]]. The seven tunnels would also help solve the problem of the unfinished [[Sljeme tunnel]], which has been a citywide nuisance for a long time.\n\nThe proposed tunnels would have an underground interchange near Jabukovac street in the hills north of the city centre. Three tunnels (one of which would have two tubes) would connect the future Jabukovac interchange with the city centre. Another tunnel would connect Jabukovac to [[Gup\u010deva zvijezda]], one would go to Zelengaj north of Britanski square and the third one would go to Von\u010dinina Street, about {{convert|1|km|mi|abbr=on}} east of Jabukovac. There would also be a tunnel connecting Dra\u0161kovi\u0107eva Street to [[Ribnjak, Zagreb]], eliminating the current long and often congested bypass which uses smaller streets near [[\u017drtava Fa\u0161izma Square]].\n\nShould the proposal be accepted, it would take three years to build the tunnels.<ref name=tuneli>{{cite web\n|url=http://www.sutra.hr/gradski-ritam/tunelima-kroz-centar-zagreba\n|title=Tunelima kroz centar Zagreba\n|accessdate=27 November 2007\n|last=\u0160imunovi\u0107\n|first=Damjan\n|date=24 November 2007\n|work=Sutra.hr\n|language=Croatian\n}}</ref>\n -->\n\n====Public transportation====\n[[File:Estaci\u00f3n Principal de FF.CC., Zagreb, Croacia, 2014-04-20, DD 03.JPG|thumb|right|[[Zagreb Glavni kolodvor|Main Railway Station]]]]\n[[File:Sede de los Ferrocarriles Croatas, Zagreb, Croacia, 2014-04-13, DD 01.JPG|thumb|right|[[Croatian Railways|Croatian Railways headquarters]]]]\n\n[[File:ZET tram&bus.jpg|thumb|right|[[Zagreba\u010dki elektri\u010dni tramvaj|ZET]] tram and city bus]]\n[[File:H\u017d Class 6112 1.JPG|thumb|right|[[H\u017d series 6112|Newest model]] of the Zagreb city trains system]]\n[[Public transport]]ation in the city is organised in several layers: the inner parts of the city are mostly covered by [[tram]]s, the outer city areas and closer suburbs are linked with [[bus]]es and rapid transit [[Zagreb Commuter Rail|commuter rail]].\n\nThe public transportation company [[Zagreba\u010dki elektri\u010dni tramvaj|ZET]] (''Zagreba\u010dki elektri\u010dni tramvaj'', Zagreb Electric Tram) operates trams, all inner bus lines, and the most of the suburban bus lines, and it is subsidised by the city council.\n\nThe national rail operator [[Croatian Railways]] (''Hrvatske \u017eeljeznice'', H\u017d) runs a network of urban and suburban train lines in the metropolitan Zagreb area, and is a [[government-owned corporation]].\n\nThe [[funicular]] (''uspinja\u010da'') in the historic part of the city is a [[tourist attraction]].\n\n[[Taxicab|Taxi]] market has been liberalized in early 2018<ref>{{cite web|url=https://vlada.gov.hr/vijesti/ministar-butkovic-novim-zakonom-o-prijevozu-u-cestovnom-prometu-jeftiniji-i-dostupniji-taksi-za-sve-gradjane/23630 |title=Ministar Butkovi\u0107: Novim Zakonom o prijevozu u cestovnom prometu jeftiniji i dostupniji taksi za sve gra\u0111ane |publisher=Government of the Republic of Croatia }}</ref> and numerous transport companies have been allowed to enter the market; consequently, the prices significantly dropped whereas the service was immensely improved so the popularity of taxis in Zagreb has been increasing from then onwards.\n\n=====Tram network=====\n{{main|Trams in Zagreb}}\nZagreb has an extensive [[tram]] network with 15-day and 4 night lines covering much of the inner- and middle-suburbs of the city.

It is a key element of the Barry Rail Centre which also includes engineering and training facilities.\n\nAn unusual aspect of the railway is that for several hundred yards across the Causeway from Barry to Barry Island, the trackbed used is directly alongside the [[Network Rail]] track which uses the original up line, with the Barry Tourist Railway using the down line. This continues from Barry to cross the Causeway and 149-yard Barry Island viaduct after which the two lines diverge into separate platforms at Barry Island. The Railway does not consider itself a line but more of a network as it has two different routes.

It is a key element of the Barry Rail Centre which also includes engineering and training facilities.\n\nAn unusual aspect of the railway is that for several hundred yards across the Causeway from Barry to Barry Island, the trackbed used is directly alongside the [[Network Rail]] track which uses the original up line, with the Barry Tourist Railway using the down line. This continues from Barry to cross the Causeway and 149-yard Barry Island viaduct after which the two lines diverge into separate platforms at Barry Island. The Railway does not consider itself a line but more of a network as it has two different routes.

It is part of the [[United Nations]] system, serving as the Regional Office for the Americas of the [[World Health Organization]] and as the health organization of the [[Organization of American States|Inter-American System]]. It is known in [[Latin America]] as the '''OPS''' or '''OPAS''' ({{lang-es|Organizaci\u00f3n Panamericana de la Salud}}; {{lang-pt|Organiza\u00e7\u00e3o Pan-Americana da Sa\u00fade}}).\n\n== Description ==\n\nPAHO has scientific and technical expertise at its headquarters, in its 27 country offices, and its three Pan American centers, all working with the countries of the Americas in dealing with priority health issues. The health authorities of PAHO's Member States set PAHO's technical and administrative policies through its Governing Bodies. PAHO Member States include all 35 countries in the Americas; [[Puerto Rico]] is an Associate Member. [[France]], the [[Kingdom of the Netherlands]], and the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland]] are Participating States, and [[Portugal]] and [[Spain]] are Observer States.\n\nThe Organization's essential mission is to strengthen national and local health systems and improve the health of the peoples of the Americas, in collaboration with Ministries of Health, other government and international agencies, [[nongovernmental organizations]], universities, social security agencies, community groups, and many others.\n\nPAHO promotes universal health coverage and universal access to health and [[Health systems strengthening|strengthening of health systems]] based on primary health care strategies. It assists countries in fighting infectious diseases such as [[malaria]], [[cholera]], [[dengue]], [[HIV]] and [[tuberculosis]] as well as the region's growing epidemic of noncommunicable diseases such as cardiovascular disease, cancer and diabetes. PAHO engages in technical cooperation with ministries of health and facilitates coordination with other sectors to promote health in all policies. PAHO also promotes the use of research evidence to inform health care decisions and policymaking through the implementation of knowledge translation strategies such as the Evidence Informed Policy Network - EVIPNet [[Evipnet]]. \n \nIn its efforts to improve health, PAHO targets the most vulnerable groups including mothers and children, workers, the poor, the elderly, and refugees and displaced persons. It focuses on issues related to equity for those who lack access to health, and on a Pan American approach, encouraging countries to work together on common issues and build lasting capacities.\n\nSpecific initiatives spearheaded by PAHO include the Expanded Program on Immunization, which played a major role in the elimination of smallpox and polio from the Americas; the Tobacco-free Americas initiative; the Regional Coalition for Water and Sanitation to Eliminate Cholera in Hispaniola; the Salt Smart Consortium; the Pan American Network for Drug Regulatory Harmonization; and a blood safety initiative that seeks to improve blood safety and efficiency by helping countries reach 100% blood supplies from unpaid voluntary donors.\n\nA major priority for the [[Americas]] is cutting [[infant mortality]], and PAHO is mobilizing new political, institutional and financial resources to prevent an additional 25,000 infant deaths every year through application of the Integrated Management of Childhood Illness strategy, a simple and practical approach in which [[primary health care]] workers are taught a complete process to evaluate the health status of children brought to a health post or clinic. They learn to recognize signs of disease and evaluate and treat them. They learn to give parents information on how to prevent disease in the home. If they see danger signs indicating the infant could die, they are taught to treat the child immediately or take him or her to a hospital.\n\nImprovement of drinking water supplies, adequate sanitation, and increased access to [[health care]] for the poor are still top priorities for PAHO, with a focus on equity. The Organization is intensifying its efforts to have countries know the true state of health of their populations and where the inequalities lie. Program efforts focus on correcting inequality, taking into account decentralization and change of state functions, on showing that health has a role to play in the success of other sectors, and on how attention to health affects positively other aspects of human development. Advocacy in this area is also directed to reducing pernicious gender inequity, which reflects in some health problems of women.\n\nThe Pan American approach is a part of PAHO history and the spirit of Panamericanism continues to stimulate technical cooperation among countries in health. PAHO has helped countries work together toward common goals, and to initiate multi-country health ventures in [[Central America]], the [[Caribbean]], the [[Andes|Andean Region]], and the [[Southern Cone]]. Experience has shown practical benefits such as the solidarity that helped Central America after [[hurricane Mitch]], and there are numerous other examples. Health collaboration found expression at the highest political level when American heads of state in their Summit in Santiago accepted a health initiative called \"Health Technology Linking the Americas.\"\n\nThe countries of [[Latin America]] and the [[Caribbean]] joined together over 20 years ago to buy vaccines through a revolving fund, bringing them tangible benefits and helping advance PAHO's efforts to eliminate or control vaccine-preventable diseases. These are among the Organization's most notable successes, starting with the eradication of smallpox from the Americas in 1973; a triumph followed five years later by global eradication of the dreaded disease.\n\nA major effort committing the Americas to embark on [[polio eradication]] in 1985 succeeded in September 1994, when a distinguished International Commission declared the Americas officially polio-free. The last case of polio in the [[Americas]] was identified August 23, 1991 in a young boy named Luis Ferm\u00edn Tenorio Cortez, in [[Jun\u00edn, Peru|Jun\u00edn]], [[Peru]]. Since then, despite intensive surveillance, no cases of [[polio]] have been detected anywhere in the [[Americas]], and the [[World Health Organization]] is now working toward the goal of eradicating polio globally. PAHO assists the countries in mobilizing the necessary resources to provide immunization and treatment services for all [[vaccine-preventable diseases]]. PAHO is close to accomplishing the goal of eliminating [[measles]] from this hemisphere and is pressing on with the introduction of new vaccines that are currently available, such as [[Haemophilus influenzae]] B. to reduce [[meningitis]] and respiratory infections. PAHO works to reduce the toll of death and illness from [[diarrheal diseases]], including [[cholera]], through case management and [[oral rehydration therapy]] to prevent deaths from dehydration, and to provide adequate diagnosis and treatment of acute respiratory infections, thus saving the lives of hundreds of thousands of children each year.\n\nPAHO disseminates scientific and technical information through its publications program, its Internet site [http://www.paho.org], and a network of academic libraries, documentation centers, and local health care libraries.\n\nThe Organization provides technical collaboration in a variety of specialized public health fields, and organizes emergency preparedness and disaster relief coordination. It supports efforts to strengthen national health systems, develop national health research systems, control [[malaria]], [[Chagas disease|Chagas]]' disease, urban [[rabies]], [[leprosy]], and other diseases that affect the people of the Americas. PAHO collaborates with governments, other agencies, and private groups to address major nutritional problems including [[protein-energy malnutrition]], and is now working to eliminate iodine and vitamin A deficiencies.\n\nIt engages in and facilitates health promotion to help countries deal with health problems typical of development and urbanization, especially non-communicable diseases (NCDs) such as [[cardiovascular diseases]], [[cancer]], [[accidents]], [[smoking]], [[addiction to drugs]] and [[alcohol (drug)|alcohol]], and injuries among others. Beyond health promotion, PAHO also addresses health systems and quality of care issues in support of national efforts to respond to the NCD pandemic.\n\nThe Organization also executes projects for other [[United Nations]] agencies, for [[international organizations]] such as the [[World Bank]] and [[Inter-American Development Bank]], for official development cooperation agencies of various governments, and for [[philanthropic foundations]].\n\nPAHO strengthens the health sector capacity in the countries to advance their priority programs through intersectoral action, promoting an integral approach to health problems. It also works to improve women's health, promoting the greater integration of women in society, as well as awareness of their importance as both recipients and providers of health services.\n\nPAHO trains health workers at all levels, through fellowships, courses and seminars, and the strengthening of national training institutions. It leads in the use of advanced communications technologies for information, health promotion, and education, working with journalists in many countries.\n\nThe Organization recognizes the role of the private sector in the delivery of services, and fosters dialogue and partnerships with the Ministries of Health. In addition to its core budget financed by quota contributions from its Member Governments, PAHO also seeks outside funding to help implement special programs and initiatives in response to vital health needs. Voluntary tax-deductible contributions for PAHO health and education projects in the [[Americas]] may be made to the [[PAHO Foundation]].\n\nDr. [[Carissa F. Etienne]] of the [[Commonwealth of Dominica]] was elected as the new director of PAHO on January 31, 2013.  PAHO's Deputy Director is Dr. Isabella Danel,<ref>{{cite web|author=PAHO|title=Isabella Danel, former CDC official, sworn in as PAHO/WHO Deputy Director |url=http://www.paho.org/hq/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=10364&Itemid=1926&lang=en|accessdate= 24 July 2015}}</ref> of the United States, and the Assistant Director is Jarbas Barbosa,<ref>https://www.paho.org/hq3/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=14529:brazilian-doctor-appointed-assistant-director-of-paho&Itemid=135&lang=en</ref> from Brazil.\n\n==History==\n\nThe organization was founded in December 1902.

At the meeting of its Executive Committee in April 1960, the PAHO decided to accept the USG's offer and set forth parameters for proceeding with the project of a new headquarters building. PAHO decided to use an international open competition as the means of selecting an architect for the project, following the recently successful model of other international organizations (most notably the United Nations New York headquarters inaugurated in 1952, and the UNESCO Paris headquarters in 1953 \u2013 both resulting in landmark designs of modernist architecture). PAHO framed the competition based on standards developed by the International Union of Architects, and determined that the competition should be open to architects from all countries of the Americas.  The vision was that \u201cthe new building should be a monument to international health cooperation.\u201d<ref>Report on Buildings and Headquarters (Document CE41/3; July 29, 1960), Submitted to the 41st meeting of the Executive Committee meeting of the Pan American Health Organization.</ref>\n\nFollowing a review of 58 entries,<ref>Quadrennial Report of the PAHO Director, July 1962, p. 78.</ref> the PAHO in October 1961 declared [[Uruguayan people|Uruguayan]] architect [[Rom\u00e1n Fresnedo Siri]] the winner of its competition. At the ceremony announcing him as winner, the organization's Director Abraham Horwitz said \u201cthis beautiful building will become a monument to the ideal of better health for the peoples of the Americas.\u201d He described the winning design as one of \u201cboth grace and utility,\u201d and said \u201cit reflects the high ideals of the Pan-American spirit in an age when we must move ahead to build a better future for our peoples.\u201d<ref>From the PAHO press release commemorating the 50th anniversary of the building, September 28, 2015.</ref>\n\nThe building was designed in a [[modern architecture|modernist style]] by Fresnedo Siri in part as a tribute to [[Le Corbusier]], a key influence on Fresnedo Siri's work.<ref name=pahobuilding/> Constructed in 1965, the exterior features 29 round bronze [[Seal (emblem)|seals]] of the founding nations of the Pan American Health Organization set in black stone.<ref name=pahobuilding>{{cite web | author=PAHO| date=15 September 2015 | title=Fifty years after its opening, PAHO's iconic modernist headquarters building is honored | publisher=PAHO | url=http://www.paho.org/HQ/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=11281&Itemid=41586&lang=en | accessdate= 9 December 2015}}</ref>  Each medallion is 2.5 feet in diameter and were designed by American sculptor [[Michael Lantz]].

Constructed of reinforced concrete over a steel frame with an exterior of glass and marble, the building is one of Washington's most recognized examples of midcentury modern architecture.  The building is divided into two distinct volumes: a gracefully curved ten-story building that hosts the organization's main offices, and an adjoining four-story cylindrical annex that serves as the congress hall for formal assemblies of the PAHO member state delegates, as well as other meetings and events. It is surrounded by George Washington University to the north and east, the Columbia Plaza office/residential complex to the west, and the State Department to the south across the E street expressway underpass.\n\nThe main building features soaring white vertical columnar ribs evenly separating dark vertical columns of glass. There are no horizontal lines to compete with the vertical symmetry; the building's vertical ribs disappear along \u201cblind gables\u201d into an invisible roofline. In the formalism and attention to symmetry, Fresnedo Siri said he was trying to stay true to the \u201cclassic spirit of the city of Washington.\u201d<ref>\u201cSpace Squeeze Put on New Health Building Mars Its Beauty: A Critique,\u201d by Wolf Von Eckardt, Washington Post Staff Writer, The Washington Post, Sep 27, 1965, p. A3</ref> The interplay of light and dark is accentuated by the use of white American marble, black Mexican granite, and dark gray glass. The building's slender, windowless west and east sides are clad in the white marble, while the black granite frames all the ground floor elements, including the entry portico, the hidden downward ramp to an underground garage, and the reflecting pool and garden elements.\n\nFresnedo Siri placed the main building on 20 rounded pilotis (columns) that lift it a full story above ground level. He employed this signature element of midcentury modernist design to maximize the open pedestrian plaza space on the relatively small and unusually shaped lot, while enhancing visual transparency and flow. He added reflecting pools with fountains at the base of each building \u2013 his vision was that the cylindrical congress hall in particular would appear to be \u201cemerging from the water.\u201d<ref>Articadi, Juan, Propuestas Urbanas de Roman Fresnedo Siri, (Doctoral thesis, Universidad Politecnica de Madrid and Universidad de la Republica \u2013 Uruguay, 2004), p. 27.</ref>  The thin vertical streams spurting up from the fountains would echo the symmetry of the columns and vertical ribbing of the main building. A row of 42 flag poles (representing each PAHO member state) reinforces still further the building's dancing array of vertical symmetries, while also gracefully delineating the northeastern edge of the property site. Unfortunately, the reflecting pools years later were eliminated, filled in and replaced by garden plots.\n\nFresnedo Siri purposefully placed the convex side of the curved main office building to the north, smoothly integrating it into the urban streetscape of similarly sized office, university and residential buildings. This allowed the concave side of the building to face the open side of the lot, gently cradling the congress hall annex while framing the contours of the small but appealing pedestrian plaza area that flows toward the site's open southern side.\n\nThe cylindrical annex's round central congress hall is about 92 feet in diameter and seats up to 300 people. The single open space soars upward, filling the top three levels of the building. Fresnedo Siri designed a dramatic spider web-like steel structure to support the building, allowing the entire interior space to be free of any supporting columns.<ref>The steel for the spider-web like structure that sustains the cylindrical conference center came from Mimsco Steel Corporation of Lorton, VA and was erected by the Heron Todd Steel Construction Company of Arlington, VA (source: The Washington Evening Star, October 30, 1964, p. F-1)</ref> The resulting internal space, naturally lit by windows throughout the cylinder's full 360 degrees, achieves an impressive sense of openness and purity of design. The cylindrical building is encased on the outside by a lattice-like grill of diamond-shaped hexagons composed of white marble, quartz and Portland cement. The recessed ground floor space of the cylinder is encased in the same Mexican black granite used for all the site's ground level elements, creating a striking contrast with the white honeycomb grill of the upper levels it supports.\n\nAfter studying the main diplomatic congress halls at the UN, State Department, the OAS and elsewhere, Fresnedo Siri devised a \u201cfloating seat\u201d solution for the chairs in the PAHO's hall. The seats are all anchored to the floor in the rear to curved latitudinal support elements running behind each row (and serving as hidden conduits for the simultaneous translation cabling), achieving what he described as \u201ca great functional and aesthetic purity.\u201d All of the furnishings for the main halls and meeting rooms were designed under his specifications by Knoll Associates, a leading New York-based producer of modernist furniture including landmark designs of the era like the Saarinen womb chair and Mies Van de Rohe's Barcelona chair. Fresnedo Siri designed the magisterial backdrop to the presidium of the Congress hall, using vertical slats of six different woods including Honduran mahogany, Brazilian jacaranda, American walnut and oak, arranged in his words \u201cto accentuate the dimension of the space and the importance of the function it served.\u201d<ref>Quote and other details from Boronat, Y. and Risso, M., Rom\u00e1n Fresnedo Siri, un Arquitecto Uruguayo.

It is part of the [[United Nations]] system, serving as the Regional Office for the Americas of the [[World Health Organization]] and as the health organization of the [[Organization of American States|Inter-American System]]. It is known in [[Latin America]] as the '''OPS''' or '''OPAS''' ({{lang-es|Organizaci\u00f3n Panamericana de la Salud}}; {{lang-pt|Organiza\u00e7\u00e3o Pan-Americana da Sa\u00fade}}).\n\n== Description ==\n\nPAHO has scientific and technical expertise at its headquarters, in its 27 country offices, and its three Pan American centers, all working with the countries of the Americas in dealing with priority health issues. The health authorities of PAHO's Member States set PAHO's technical and administrative policies through its Governing Bodies. PAHO Member States include all 35 countries in the Americas; [[Puerto Rico]] is an Associate Member. [[France]], the [[Kingdom of the Netherlands]], and the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland]] are Participating States, and [[Portugal]] and [[Spain]] are Observer States.\n\nThe Organization's essential mission is to strengthen national and local health systems and improve the health of the peoples of the Americas, in collaboration with Ministries of Health, other government and international agencies, [[nongovernmental organizations]], universities, social security agencies, community groups, and many others.\n\nPAHO promotes universal health coverage and universal access to health and [[Health systems strengthening|strengthening of health systems]] based on primary health care strategies. It assists countries in fighting infectious diseases such as [[malaria]], [[cholera]], [[dengue]], [[HIV]] and [[tuberculosis]] as well as the region's growing epidemic of noncommunicable diseases such as cardiovascular disease, cancer and diabetes. PAHO engages in technical cooperation with ministries of health and facilitates coordination with other sectors to promote health in all policies. PAHO also promotes the use of research evidence to inform health care decisions and policymaking through the implementation of knowledge translation strategies such as the Evidence Informed Policy Network - EVIPNet [[Evipnet]]. \n \nIn its efforts to improve health, PAHO targets the most vulnerable groups including mothers and children, workers, the poor, the elderly, and refugees and displaced persons. It focuses on issues related to equity for those who lack access to health, and on a Pan American approach, encouraging countries to work together on common issues and build lasting capacities.\n\nSpecific initiatives spearheaded by PAHO include the Expanded Program on Immunization, which played a major role in the elimination of smallpox and polio from the Americas; the Tobacco-free Americas initiative; the Regional Coalition for Water and Sanitation to Eliminate Cholera in Hispaniola; the Salt Smart Consortium; the Pan American Network for Drug Regulatory Harmonization; and a blood safety initiative that seeks to improve blood safety and efficiency by helping countries reach 100% blood supplies from unpaid voluntary donors.\n\nA major priority for the [[Americas]] is cutting [[infant mortality]], and PAHO is mobilizing new political, institutional and financial resources to prevent an additional 25,000 infant deaths every year through application of the Integrated Management of Childhood Illness strategy, a simple and practical approach in which [[primary health care]] workers are taught a complete process to evaluate the health status of children brought to a health post or clinic. They learn to recognize signs of disease and evaluate and treat them. They learn to give parents information on how to prevent disease in the home. If they see danger signs indicating the infant could die, they are taught to treat the child immediately or take him or her to a hospital.\n\nImprovement of drinking water supplies, adequate sanitation, and increased access to [[health care]] for the poor are still top priorities for PAHO, with a focus on equity. The Organization is intensifying its efforts to have countries know the true state of health of their populations and where the inequalities lie. Program efforts focus on correcting inequality, taking into account decentralization and change of state functions, on showing that health has a role to play in the success of other sectors, and on how attention to health affects positively other aspects of human development. Advocacy in this area is also directed to reducing pernicious gender inequity, which reflects in some health problems of women.\n\nThe Pan American approach is a part of PAHO history and the spirit of Panamericanism continues to stimulate technical cooperation among countries in health. PAHO has helped countries work together toward common goals, and to initiate multi-country health ventures in [[Central America]], the [[Caribbean]], the [[Andes|Andean Region]], and the [[Southern Cone]]. Experience has shown practical benefits such as the solidarity that helped Central America after [[hurricane Mitch]], and there are numerous other examples. Health collaboration found expression at the highest political level when American heads of state in their Summit in Santiago accepted a health initiative called \"Health Technology Linking the Americas.\"\n\nThe countries of [[Latin America]] and the [[Caribbean]] joined together over 20 years ago to buy vaccines through a revolving fund, bringing them tangible benefits and helping advance PAHO's efforts to eliminate or control vaccine-preventable diseases. These are among the Organization's most notable successes, starting with the eradication of smallpox from the Americas in 1973; a triumph followed five years later by global eradication of the dreaded disease.\n\nA major effort committing the Americas to embark on [[polio eradication]] in 1985 succeeded in September 1994, when a distinguished International Commission declared the Americas officially polio-free. The last case of polio in the [[Americas]] was identified August 23, 1991 in a young boy named Luis Ferm\u00edn Tenorio Cortez, in [[Jun\u00edn, Peru|Jun\u00edn]], [[Peru]]. Since then, despite intensive surveillance, no cases of [[polio]] have been detected anywhere in the [[Americas]], and the [[World Health Organization]] is now working toward the goal of eradicating polio globally. PAHO assists the countries in mobilizing the necessary resources to provide immunization and treatment services for all [[vaccine-preventable diseases]]. PAHO is close to accomplishing the goal of eliminating [[measles]] from this hemisphere and is pressing on with the introduction of new vaccines that are currently available, such as [[Haemophilus influenzae]] B. to reduce [[meningitis]] and respiratory infections. PAHO works to reduce the toll of death and illness from [[diarrheal diseases]], including [[cholera]], through case management and [[oral rehydration therapy]] to prevent deaths from dehydration, and to provide adequate diagnosis and treatment of acute respiratory infections, thus saving the lives of hundreds of thousands of children each year.\n\nPAHO disseminates scientific and technical information through its publications program, its Internet site [http://www.paho.org], and a network of academic libraries, documentation centers, and local health care libraries.\n\nThe Organization provides technical collaboration in a variety of specialized public health fields, and organizes emergency preparedness and disaster relief coordination. It supports efforts to strengthen national health systems, develop national health research systems, control [[malaria]], [[Chagas disease|Chagas]]' disease, urban [[rabies]], [[leprosy]], and other diseases that affect the people of the Americas. PAHO collaborates with governments, other agencies, and private groups to address major nutritional problems including [[protein-energy malnutrition]], and is now working to eliminate iodine and vitamin A deficiencies.\n\nIt engages in and facilitates health promotion to help countries deal with health problems typical of development and urbanization, especially non-communicable diseases (NCDs) such as [[cardiovascular diseases]], [[cancer]], [[accidents]], [[smoking]], [[addiction to drugs]] and [[alcohol (drug)|alcohol]], and injuries among others. Beyond health promotion, PAHO also addresses health systems and quality of care issues in support of national efforts to respond to the NCD pandemic.\n\nThe Organization also executes projects for other [[United Nations]] agencies, for [[international organizations]] such as the [[World Bank]] and [[Inter-American Development Bank]], for official development cooperation agencies of various governments, and for [[philanthropic foundations]].\n\nPAHO strengthens the health sector capacity in the countries to advance their priority programs through intersectoral action, promoting an integral approach to health problems. It also works to improve women's health, promoting the greater integration of women in society, as well as awareness of their importance as both recipients and providers of health services.\n\nPAHO trains health workers at all levels, through fellowships, courses and seminars, and the strengthening of national training institutions. It leads in the use of advanced communications technologies for information, health promotion, and education, working with journalists in many countries.\n\nThe Organization recognizes the role of the private sector in the delivery of services, and fosters dialogue and partnerships with the Ministries of Health. In addition to its core budget financed by quota contributions from its Member Governments, PAHO also seeks outside funding to help implement special programs and initiatives in response to vital health needs. Voluntary tax-deductible contributions for PAHO health and education projects in the [[Americas]] may be made to the [[PAHO Foundation]].\n\nDr. [[Carissa F. Etienne]] of the [[Commonwealth of Dominica]] was elected as the new director of PAHO on January 31, 2013.  PAHO's Deputy Director is Dr. Isabella Danel,<ref>{{cite web|author=PAHO|title=Isabella Danel, former CDC official, sworn in as PAHO/WHO Deputy Director |url=http://www.paho.org/hq/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=10364&Itemid=1926&lang=en|accessdate= 24 July 2015}}</ref> of the United States, and the Assistant Director is Jarbas Barbosa,<ref>https://www.paho.org/hq3/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=14529:brazilian-doctor-appointed-assistant-director-of-paho&Itemid=135&lang=en</ref> from Brazil.\n\n==History==\n\nThe organization was founded in December 1902.

Today the usual phrasing is \"Regional Office for the Americas\".\n\n==Headquarters building==\n[[File:Pan American Health Organization Building.jpg|thumb|Pan American Health Organization building, Washington, DC]]\n[[File:PAHO-Auditorium-Stage-DC.jpg|thumb|Stage of the Pan-American Health Organization building Auditorium in Washington, DC]]\n\nIn March 1960, President Eisenhower signed into law a bill passed by the U.S. Congress <ref>Authorized by Public Law 86-395, March 28, 1960; funding subsequently appropriated by Public Law 86-678, August 31, 1960.</ref> authorizing the U.S. government to purchase and donate a lot for the PAHO headquarters in Washington, D.C. At the meeting of its Executive Committee in April 1960, the PAHO decided to accept the USG's offer and set forth parameters for proceeding with the project of a new headquarters building. PAHO decided to use an international open competition as the means of selecting an architect for the project, following the recently successful model of other international organizations (most notably the United Nations New York headquarters inaugurated in 1952, and the UNESCO Paris headquarters in 1953 \u2013 both resulting in landmark designs of modernist architecture). PAHO framed the competition based on standards developed by the International Union of Architects, and determined that the competition should be open to architects from all countries of the Americas.  The vision was that \u201cthe new building should be a monument to international health cooperation.\u201d<ref>Report on Buildings and Headquarters (Document CE41/3; July 29, 1960), Submitted to the 41st meeting of the Executive Committee meeting of the Pan American Health Organization.</ref>\n\nFollowing a review of 58 entries,<ref>Quadrennial Report of the PAHO Director, July 1962, p. 78.</ref> the PAHO in October 1961 declared [[Uruguayan people|Uruguayan]] architect [[Rom\u00e1n Fresnedo Siri]] the winner of its competition. At the ceremony announcing him as winner, the organization's Director Abraham Horwitz said \u201cthis beautiful building will become a monument to the ideal of better health for the peoples of the Americas.\u201d He described the winning design as one of \u201cboth grace and utility,\u201d and said \u201cit reflects the high ideals of the Pan-American spirit in an age when we must move ahead to build a better future for our peoples.\u201d<ref>From the PAHO press release commemorating the 50th anniversary of the building, September 28, 2015.</ref>\n\nThe building was designed in a [[modern architecture|modernist style]] by Fresnedo Siri in part as a tribute to [[Le Corbusier]], a key influence on Fresnedo Siri's work.<ref name=pahobuilding/> Constructed in 1965, the exterior features 29 round bronze [[Seal (emblem)|seals]] of the founding nations of the Pan American Health Organization set in black stone.<ref name=pahobuilding>{{cite web | author=PAHO| date=15 September 2015 | title=Fifty years after its opening, PAHO's iconic modernist headquarters building is honored | publisher=PAHO | url=http://www.paho.org/HQ/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=11281&Itemid=41586&lang=en | accessdate= 9 December 2015}}</ref>  Each medallion is 2.5 feet in diameter and were designed by American sculptor [[Michael Lantz]].

Constructed of reinforced concrete over a steel frame with an exterior of glass and marble, the building is one of Washington's most recognized examples of midcentury modern architecture.  The building is divided into two distinct volumes: a gracefully curved ten-story building that hosts the organization's main offices, and an adjoining four-story cylindrical annex that serves as the congress hall for formal assemblies of the PAHO member state delegates, as well as other meetings and events. It is surrounded by George Washington University to the north and east, the Columbia Plaza office/residential complex to the west, and the State Department to the south across the E street expressway underpass.\n\nThe main building features soaring white vertical columnar ribs evenly separating dark vertical columns of glass. There are no horizontal lines to compete with the vertical symmetry; the building's vertical ribs disappear along \u201cblind gables\u201d into an invisible roofline. In the formalism and attention to symmetry, Fresnedo Siri said he was trying to stay true to the \u201cclassic spirit of the city of Washington.\u201d<ref>\u201cSpace Squeeze Put on New Health Building Mars Its Beauty: A Critique,\u201d by Wolf Von Eckardt, Washington Post Staff Writer, The Washington Post, Sep 27, 1965, p. A3</ref> The interplay of light and dark is accentuated by the use of white American marble, black Mexican granite, and dark gray glass. The building's slender, windowless west and east sides are clad in the white marble, while the black granite frames all the ground floor elements, including the entry portico, the hidden downward ramp to an underground garage, and the reflecting pool and garden elements.\n\nFresnedo Siri placed the main building on 20 rounded pilotis (columns) that lift it a full story above ground level. He employed this signature element of midcentury modernist design to maximize the open pedestrian plaza space on the relatively small and unusually shaped lot, while enhancing visual transparency and flow. He added reflecting pools with fountains at the base of each building \u2013 his vision was that the cylindrical congress hall in particular would appear to be \u201cemerging from the water.\u201d<ref>Articadi, Juan, Propuestas Urbanas de Roman Fresnedo Siri, (Doctoral thesis, Universidad Politecnica de Madrid and Universidad de la Republica \u2013 Uruguay, 2004), p. 27.</ref>  The thin vertical streams spurting up from the fountains would echo the symmetry of the columns and vertical ribbing of the main building. A row of 42 flag poles (representing each PAHO member state) reinforces still further the building's dancing array of vertical symmetries, while also gracefully delineating the northeastern edge of the property site. Unfortunately, the reflecting pools years later were eliminated, filled in and replaced by garden plots.\n\nFresnedo Siri purposefully placed the convex side of the curved main office building to the north, smoothly integrating it into the urban streetscape of similarly sized office, university and residential buildings. This allowed the concave side of the building to face the open side of the lot, gently cradling the congress hall annex while framing the contours of the small but appealing pedestrian plaza area that flows toward the site's open southern side.\n\nThe cylindrical annex's round central congress hall is about 92 feet in diameter and seats up to 300 people. The single open space soars upward, filling the top three levels of the building. Fresnedo Siri designed a dramatic spider web-like steel structure to support the building, allowing the entire interior space to be free of any supporting columns.<ref>The steel for the spider-web like structure that sustains the cylindrical conference center came from Mimsco Steel Corporation of Lorton, VA and was erected by the Heron Todd Steel Construction Company of Arlington, VA (source: The Washington Evening Star, October 30, 1964, p. F-1)</ref> The resulting internal space, naturally lit by windows throughout the cylinder's full 360 degrees, achieves an impressive sense of openness and purity of design. The cylindrical building is encased on the outside by a lattice-like grill of diamond-shaped hexagons composed of white marble, quartz and Portland cement. The recessed ground floor space of the cylinder is encased in the same Mexican black granite used for all the site's ground level elements, creating a striking contrast with the white honeycomb grill of the upper levels it supports.\n\nAfter studying the main diplomatic congress halls at the UN, State Department, the OAS and elsewhere, Fresnedo Siri devised a \u201cfloating seat\u201d solution for the chairs in the PAHO's hall. The seats are all anchored to the floor in the rear to curved latitudinal support elements running behind each row (and serving as hidden conduits for the simultaneous translation cabling), achieving what he described as \u201ca great functional and aesthetic purity.\u201d All of the furnishings for the main halls and meeting rooms were designed under his specifications by Knoll Associates, a leading New York-based producer of modernist furniture including landmark designs of the era like the Saarinen womb chair and Mies Van de Rohe's Barcelona chair. Fresnedo Siri designed the magisterial backdrop to the presidium of the Congress hall, using vertical slats of six different woods including Honduran mahogany, Brazilian jacaranda, American walnut and oak, arranged in his words \u201cto accentuate the dimension of the space and the importance of the function it served.\u201d<ref>Quote and other details from Boronat, Y. and Risso, M., Rom\u00e1n Fresnedo Siri, un Arquitecto Uruguayo.

Cruises offered from that time circumnavigations Australia, circumnavigations [[New Zealand]], and visits to [[New Caledonia]] and [[Vanuatu]]. In 2012, she offered her first world cruise.\n\nIn April 2008, ''Sun Princess'' was based in Australia, operating out of Sydney during the winter months, and from Melbourne during the summer months. For the 2008/2009 season the cruise program included Australian circumnavigations, [[Fremantle]] - [[Malacca Straits]] return, [[Melbourne]] -  New Zealand / South Pacific. ''Sun Princess'' also sailed from Sydney for Melbourne plus [[Whitsunday Islands|Whitsundays]] return, a [[Japan]] return itinerary, and a 75 night Grand Pacific trip.\n\nDuring summer 2008/2009 whilst ''Sun Princess'' was operating out of Melbourne, she was joined by ''Dawn Princess'' operating out of Sydney. ''Dawn Princess'' was also permanently based in Australia from that time which was a change from Princess Cruises' original plans.\n\nDemand for ''Sun Princess'' cruises between Sydney and Fremantle and beyond from April to June 2008 was so strong that Princess Cruises scheduled additional sailings for 2009.  The company also decided to base the vessel in Fremantle from April to August that year.
