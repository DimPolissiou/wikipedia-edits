They have featured such notable players as [[Kareem Abdul-Jabbar]], [[Sidney Moncrief]], [[Oscar Robertson]], [[Bob Dandridge]], [[Bob Lanier (basketball)|Bob Lanier]], [[Glenn Robinson]], [[Ray Allen]], [[Sam Cassell]], [[Junior Bridgeman]], [[Michael Redd]], [[Terry Cummings]], [[Vin Baker]], [[Jon McGlocklin]], [[Marques Johnson]], and [[Brian Winters]]. Abdul-Jabbar and [[Giannis Antetokounmpo]] have been named the NBA's [[NBA Most Valuable Player Award|Most Valuable Player]] while playing for the Bucks, for a total of four MVP awards.\n\n==Franchise history==\n\n===Team creation===\nOn January 22, 1968, the NBA awarded a [[Sport franchising|franchise]] to Milwaukee Professional Sports and Services, Inc. (Milwaukee Pro), a group headed by Wesley Pavalon and Marvin Fishman. A fan contest was held to name the new team, with over 40,000 fans participating.<ref>{{cite web |title=On This Day in 1968: Milwaukee Awarded an NBA Franchise |url=https://www.nba.com/bucks/features/milwaukee-awarded-nba-franchise-1968 |website=NBA.com |accessdate=December 10, 2019 |date=January 22, 2016}}</ref> While the most-voted fan entry was the ''Robins'', named for Wisconsin's state bird, the contest judges went with the second-most popular choice, the ''Bucks'', which was a reference to Wisconsin's official wild animal, the [[white-tailed deer]]. One fan, R. D.

In October, the Bucks played their first NBA regular-season game against the [[Chicago Bulls]] before a [[Milwaukee Arena]] crowd of 8,467. As is typical with expansion teams, the Bucks' first season ([[1968\u201369 NBA season|1968\u201369]]) was a struggle. Their first victory came in their sixth game as the Bucks beat the [[Detroit Pistons]] 134\u2013118; they won only 26 more games in their first year. The Bucks' record that year earned them a coin flip against their expansion cousins, the [[Phoenix Suns]], to see who would get the first pick in the upcoming draft. It was considered a foregone conclusion that the first pick in the draft would be [[Kareem Abdul-Jabbar|Lew Alcindor]] of [[UCLA]]. The Bucks won the coin flip, but had to win a bidding war with the upstart [[American Basketball Association]] (ABA) to secure him.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nbaarena.com/en/teams/10/milwaukee-bucks |title=NBAarena.com: Teams&nbsp;\u2013 Milwaukee GENERAL INFORMATION |accessdate=January 29, 2012}}</ref>\n\n===1969\u20131975: The Kareem Abdul-Jabbar era===\n[[File:Kareem Abdul-Jabbar 1974.jpeg|thumb|175px|left|During his six seasons with the Bucks, Abdul-Jabbar averaged 30.4 points and 15.3 rebounds per game.]]\nDespite the Bucks' stroke of fortune in landing Alcindor, no one expected what happened in [[1969\u201370 NBA season|1969\u201370]]. They finished with a 56\u201326 record \u2013 a nearly exact reversal of the previous year and good enough for the second-best record in the league, behind the [[New York Knicks]]. The 29-game improvement was the best in league history \u2013 a record which would stand for 10 years until the [[Boston Celtics]] jumped from 29 wins in [[1978\u201379 NBA season|1978\u201379]] to 61 in [[1979\u201380 NBA season|1979\u201380]] (the difference again being a highly touted rookie, [[Larry Bird]]). The Bucks defeated the [[Philadelphia 76ers]] in five games in the Eastern semifinals, only to be dispatched in five by the Knicks in the Eastern finals. Alcindor was a runaway selection for [[NBA Rookie of the Year]].\n\n[[File:Oscar Robertson Bucks.jpeg|thumb|Robertson as a member of the Milwaukee Bucks]]\n[[1970\u201371 NBA season|The following season]], the Bucks got an unexpected gift when they acquired [[Oscar Robertson]], known as the \"Big O\", in a trade with the [[Cincinnati Royals]]. Subsequently, in only their third season, the Bucks finished 66\u201316 \u2013 the second-most wins in NBA history at the time, and still the most in franchise history. During the regular season, the Bucks recorded a then-NBA record [[List of National Basketball Association longest winning streaks|20-game win streak]]. They then steamrolled through the playoffs with a dominating 12\u20132 record, winning the NBA Championship on April 30, 1971, by sweeping the [[Baltimore Bullets (1963\u201373)|Baltimore Bullets]] in four games. By winning it all in only their third season, the Bucks became the fastest true expansion team in the history of North American sports to win a championship. As of 2018, it remains the only title in team history.\n\nThe Bucks remained a powerhouse for the first half of the 1970s. In 1972, Lew Alcindor converted to Islam and changed his name to [[Kareem Abdul-Jabbar]]. Milwaukee beat the Warriors in the playoffs 4\u20131, but lost the conference finals to Los Angeles 4\u20132. In 1973, they recorded their third consecutive 60-win season, the first NBA team to do so, but injuries resulted in an early playoff exit. The Bucks were back in the [[1974 NBA Finals]] against the [[Boston Celtics]]. In game six of the series, Abdul-Jabbar made his famous \"[[Hook shot|sky hook]]\" shot to end a classic double-overtime victory for the Bucks. The Bucks lost game seven and the series to the Celtics; as of 2018, they had not returned to the [[NBA Finals]]. As the 1974\u20131975 season began, Abdul-Jabbar suffered a hand injury and the team got off to a 3\u201313 start. After his return, other injuries befell Milwaukee, sending them to the bottom of their division with 38 wins and 44 losses. When the season ended, Abdul-Jabbar made the stunning announcement that he no longer wished to play for the Bucks. Desiring to play in a larger city, requesting a trade to either Los Angeles or New York City. The front office was unable to convince him otherwise and on June 16, 1975, the Bucks pulled a mega-trade by sending Abdul-Jabbar to the Lakers for [[Elmore Smith]], [[Junior Bridgeman]], [[Brian Winters]] and [[David Meyers (basketball)|David Meyers]]. The trade triggered a series of events that led to a change in the team's ownership. Minority owner and cable television executive [[Jim Fitzgerald]] opposed the trade and wanted to sell his stock. Although Fitzgerald was the team's largest single shareholder, he did not own enough stock to control the team.\n\n===1976\u20131979: Transition from Abdul-Jabbar===\nAfter the deal, the Bucks had several seasons in transition, but most of these players would go on to help the team. After being sold to Fitzgerald and several partners in 1976, the Bucks would enter into another era of greatness. It began with [[Don Nelson]] who became head coach in November 1976 after [[Larry Costello]] abruptly resigned. In the 1977 draft, the Bucks had three first round picks and drafted [[Kent Benson]], [[Marques Johnson]] and [[Ernie Grunfeld]]. Johnson would become a staple in the Bucks for years to come. Rookie [[Sidney Moncrief]] made his debut in 1979. Don Nelson went on to win two [[NBA Coach of the Year]] awards with the Bucks, both during seasons where the team won division titles, in 1983 and 1985.\n\nOn October 18, 1977, Abdul-Jabbar, playing with the Lakers, punched Benson during a game. Abdul-Jabbar broke his hand in the process.<ref>{{cite web|title=Walton Injury Opens Door for Bullets|url=http://www.nba.com/history/season/19771978.html|publisher=NBA Media Ventures, LLC|website=NBA.com|accessdate=June 30, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090314045723/http://www.nba.com/history/season/19771978.html|archive-date=March 14, 2009|url-status=dead}}</ref> Benson had been aggressive under the boards and Abdul-Jabbar, a [[martial arts]] [[blackbelt (martial arts)|blackbelt]], snapped. Abdul-Jabbar was fined $5,000 by the NBA and missed the next 20 games. Meanwhile, Benson never played as aggressively again and the Bucks traded him to the [[Detroit Pistons]] in 1980 for veteran center [[Bob Lanier (basketball)|Bob Lanier]] to fill in the hole left by the departure of Abdul-Jabbar. They then won the [[Midwest Division (NBA)|Midwest Division]] title in 1980. After losing to Seattle in the semi-finals, the Bucks moved to the [[Eastern Conference (NBA)|Eastern Conference]]'s [[Central Division (NBA)|Central Division]].\n\n===1979\u20131990: The Sidney Moncrief era===\nThere, they would win six straight division titles and have .500 seasons for the next 11 years. Within those years, the Bucks became perennial Eastern Conference contenders, primarily due to the strong play of Moncrief, [[Marques Johnson]], [[Paul Pressey]], [[Craig Hodges]] and the arrival of [[Terry Cummings]], [[Ricky Pierce]] and [[Jack Sikma]] from trades with the [[Los Angeles Clippers]] and [[Seattle SuperSonics]] respectively. However, the Bucks were unable to make it to the NBA Finals again, being eliminated by either the Celtics or the [[Philadelphia 76ers|Sixers]] each time.\n\nFor much of the 1970s the Bucks colors were forest green, deep red and white. In 1978, they added various shades of green to the uniforms, and in 1985, they eliminated red from the team colors.\n\nNoteworthy for the 1980s Bucks is that in [[1983 NBA Playoffs|1983]] they became the first, and until [[2003 NBA Playoffs|2003]], only team in NBA history to sweep the [[Boston Celtics]] in a best-of-seven playoff series, being the first team to meet and defeat [[Michael Jordan]] in [[1985 NBA Playoffs|a playoff series]] (during Jordan's rookie year), and hosting [[Julius Erving]]'s final NBA game in the [[1987 NBA Playoffs]], which would see the Bucks advancing with a game five first-round playoff victory.\n\n====Ownership and arena changes====\nIn 1985, Fitzgerald and his partners (one of which was Stuart Shadel) decided to sell the Bucks. He was having health problems and some of his investors wanted to get out. The Bucks were playing in the smallest arena in the NBA and the city did not want to build a new one. Milwaukee businessman and future U.S. Senator [[Herb Kohl]] bought the Bucks after fears that out-of-town investors could buy the team and move it out of Milwaukee. Before the transaction was complete, broadcaster [[Lloyd Pettit]] and his wife, [[Jane Bradley Pettit]], announced they were donating a new arena called the [[Bradley Center]]. In 2003, after considering selling the team, Kohl announced that he had decided against selling the Bucks to [[Michael Jordan]] and would \"continue to own them, improve them and commit them to remaining in Wisconsin\".\n\nOn May 21, 2012, the [[naming rights]] of the Bradley Center were sold to the [[BMO Harris Bank]] division of [[Bank of Montreal]], which had purchased the assets of [[M&I Bank]] a year earlier. After the heirs to the Bradley fortune gave their approval, the arena was renamed the \"BMO Harris Bradley Center\".<ref>{{cite press release|title=Milwaukee's Bradley Center Becomes the BMO Harris Bradley Center As Local \"Champions of the Community\" Come Forward to Support Jane Bradley Pettit's Gift|url=http://www.nba.com/bucks/release/milwaukees-bradley-center-becomes-bmo-harris-bradley-center-local-champions-community-come-f|publisher=NBA Media Ventures, LLC|website=Bucks.com|date=May 21, 2012|accessdate=October 3, 2015}}</ref>\n\n===1990\u20131998: Era of struggles===\n[[File:Toni Kukoc.jpg|left|thumb|150px|[[Toni Kuko\u010d]] playing for the Bucks.]]\nFor most of the 1990s, the Bucks franchise was mired in mediocrity under coaches [[Frank Hamblen]], [[Mike Dunleavy, Sr.|Mike Dunleavy]], and [[Chris Ford]]. From 1991 through 1998, the Bucks suffered a franchise-record seven straight losing seasons. During this period, the Bucks drafted [[Glenn Robinson]] with the first overall pick in the 1994 NBA Draft and in 1996 acquired rookie [[Ray Allen]] in a draft day trade with the [[Minnesota Timberwolves]]. Both players would have prominent roles in the Bucks resurgence during the late 1990s.\n\nAfter the franchise's 25th anniversary in 1993, the Bucks overhauled their logo and uniforms. The colors were green, purple, and silver. The old logo, which featured a cartoonish deer, was replaced in favor of a more realistic one. The primary color scheme was altered as well, when red was supplanted by purple. Purple road uniforms replaced the former green away uniforms.\n\nIn 1997, the Bucks sent all-star forward [[Vin Baker]] in a three-team trade to the [[Seattle SuperSonics]], and they would acquire [[Cleveland Cavaliers]] guard [[Terrell Brandon]] and forward [[Tyrone Hill]]. They also traded their 10th overall pick [[Danny Fortson]], guard [[Johnny Newman]], and center [[Joe Wolf]] to the [[Denver Nuggets]] for center [[Ervin Johnson]]. The 1997\u201398 Bucks finished their season with a 36\u201346 record, failing to make the playoffs for the seventh consecutive time.\n\n===1998\u20132003: Big Three era===\nAfter a decade of dwelling near the bottom of the NBA's standings, the Bucks looked to add credibility to their basketball operations. In 1998, the team hired veteran coach [[George Karl]], who had reached the [[NBA Finals]] with the [[Seattle SuperSonics]]. Under the leadership of Karl and general manager [[Ernie Grunfeld]], and with the steady addition of talent such as [[Tim Thomas (basketball)|Tim Thomas]] and [[Sam Cassell]], the Bucks developed into an elite team in the Eastern Conference. The nucleus of the \"big three\"\u2014consisting of [[Ray Allen]], Cassell, and Robinson\u2014along with Karl, created a successful renaissance era in Milwaukee. The team reached its zenith in 2000\u20132001, winning 52 games and their first division title in 15 years. The Bucks reached the 2001 Eastern Conference Finals by defeating the Charlotte Hornets. They lost the Eastern Conference finals in seven games to the 76ers.\n\nAfter coming within one game of an NBA Finals appearance in 2001, the Bucks sought to make key off-season player additions to put the team in the NBA Finals. Behind the strong encouragement of George Karl, the Bucks acquired forward [[Anthony Mason (basketball)|Anthony Mason]] at the beginning of the [[2001\u201302 NBA season|2001\u201302 season]]. On paper, this move made the Bucks the team to beat in the East. However, Mason battled with his weight and had a tough time finding his role.<ref>{{cite web|last=Markus|first=Don|title=Jury still out on Mason as plus/minus for Bucks|url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/2001-11-18/sports/0111180209_1_anthony-mason-milwaukee-bucks-karl|work=[[The Baltimore Sun]]|date=November 18, 2001|accessdate=November 18, 2001}}</ref> The Bucks, who at the season's midway point were the fourth seed in the Eastern Conference, went into a swoon in February and March. The collapse culminated with a loss to the [[Detroit Pistons]] on the final night of the season, which eliminated the Bucks from the playoffs and gave the division to the Pistons. The fallout created tension between Karl and the players, resulting in a trade of [[Glenn Robinson]] to Atlanta (for [[Toni Kuko\u010d]] and a 2003 first-round draft pick, used to select [[T. J. Ford]]).\n\nDuring the [[2002\u201303 NBA season|2002\u201303 season]], the Bucks traded Ray Allen and backup Ronald \"Flip\" Murray to the [[Seattle SuperSonics]] for [[Gary Payton]] and [[Desmond Mason]]. The trade allowed emerging star [[Michael Redd]] to see increased playing time, and with Payton in the backcourt, they finished the season with a 42\u201340 record. The Bucks made the playoffs, but lost in the first round to the [[New Jersey Nets]] in six games. That offseason, team leaders [[Sam Cassell]] and Ervin Johnson were traded to Minnesota (for [[Joe Smith (basketball)|Joe Smith]]). Payton left via free agency, after playing only 28 games for the Bucks. Karl's tenure also ended after the season. Within a one-year period, the team had lost the coach and players most responsible for the team's success during that era.\n\n===2003\u20132009: Michael Redd era===\n[[File:ReddBucks.jpg|right|thumb|150px|Michael Redd playing for the Bucks.]]\nUnder the direction of new general manager [[Larry Harris (basketball)|Larry Harris]], the Bucks struggled with inconsistency and injury for the next six years. During that period, they reached the playoffs twice, first under coach [[Terry Porter]] in [[2004 NBA Playoffs|2004]] and then under [[Terry Stotts]] in [[2006 NBA Playoffs|2006]]. In both instances, they were defeated by the [[Detroit Pistons]] in five games. During that period, [[Michael Redd]] blossomed into an all-star and a perimeter shooting threat, becoming the new \"face of the franchise\".<ref>{{cite web|last=Poust|first=Nick|url=http://bleacherreport.com/articles/993429-the-stardom-downfall-and-potential-resurrection-of-michael-redd|title=The stardom, downfall, and potential resurrection of Michael Redd|website=Bleacher Report|date=December 21, 2011|accessdate=April 25, 2015}}</ref> The Bucks received the first pick in the [[2005 NBA draft]], and used it to select center [[Andrew Bogut]]. Bogut struggled with both inconsistency and injuries in his first four years in Milwaukee, but over time became a key contributor to the Bucks.\n\nIn 2006, the team finished 40\u201342, last in their division, 24 games behind Detroit, but still made the playoffs in a season where every team in their division did. They were paired as the eighth seed versus the 64\u201318 conference-leading Pistons. They won game three at home, but lost the other four in a 4\u20131 series loss.\n\nAlso in March, the Bucks announced that they would not renew general manager [[Larry Harris (basketball)|Larry Harris]]'s contract, which was to expire in June. In April, the Bucks hired John Hammond, formerly vice-president of basketball operations for the Pistons, as their new general manager,<ref>{{cite news|title=Bucks name John Hammond General Manager|url=http://www.nba.com/bucks/news/hammond_named_general_manager_080411.html?rss=true|publisher=NBA Media Ventures, LLC|website=Bucks.com|date=April 11, 2008|accessdate=June 30, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081225045344/http://www.nba.com/bucks/news/hammond_named_general_manager_080411.html?rss=true|archive-date=December 25, 2008|url-status=dead}}</ref> giving the Milwaukee team a fresh director recently associated with success.\n\nAlso in April, the Bucks announced that [[Larry Krystkowiak]], the third and final head coach hired by Larry Harris, had been relieved of his duties. [[Scott Skiles]], formerly of the [[Chicago Bulls]] and [[Phoenix Suns]], became head coach.\n\nOn June 26, 2008, the Bucks acquired [[Richard Jefferson]] from the [[New Jersey Nets]] in a trade for 2007 first-round draft pick [[Yi Jianlian]] and [[Bobby Simmons]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/draft2008/news/story?id=3462210|title=Nets send top scorer Jefferson to Bucks for Yi, Simmons|publisher=ESPN|accessdate=June 30, 2015}}</ref> Later that day, the Bucks selected West Virginia's [[Joe Alexander (basketball)|Joe Alexander]] with the eighth pick of the NBA draft. Alexander was the first Taiwanese-born player in the NBA.\n\n===2009\u20132013: Arrival of Brandon Jennings===\n[[File:Jennings3 20091204.jpg|left|thumb|150px|Brandon Jennings]]\nIn the [[2009 NBA draft]], the Milwaukee Bucks selected point guard [[Brandon Jennings]], who had not gone to college but played in [[Lega Basket Serie A|Italy]] the previous year. Midway through the season, Bucks' general manager [[John Hammond (basketball)|John Hammond]] traded [[Hakim Warrick]] to the [[Chicago Bulls]], and acquired [[John Salmons]]. In a Bucks uniform, Salmons averaged a team-leading 19.9 points per game. The play of Jennings, along with the improvement of Andrew Bogut, the improved [[Ersan \u0130lyasova]], and the Salmons trade, catapulted the team to be a playoff contender. At the beginning of the season, the Bucks had low playoffs expectations; they had not been in four years.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vegasinsider.com/nba/scoreboard/previews/76ers-@-bucks.cfm/date/03-24-10|title=NBA Previews for the Philadelphia 76ers vs. Milwaukee Bucks Matchup|publisher=Vegas Insider|date=March 24, 2010|accessdate=April 25, 2015}}</ref> In October, the Bucks quickly fell behind the [[Cleveland Cavaliers]] in the Central Division, but Milwaukee ultimately clinched a playoff berth on April 6, 2010, with a road win over the [[Chicago Bulls]]. It was during that time that the phrase ''\"Fear the Deer\"'' started, most likely by an ESPN commentator, and adopted on message boards and within Andrew Bogut's Squad 6.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jsonline.com/blogs/business/89079357.html|title='Fear the Deer' is catching on|author=Don Walker|accessdate=June 30, 2015}}</ref> The slogan rang well with Bucks fans, who started bringing signs with the phrase to games. The slogan became the team's battle cry in the NBA playoffs. The Bucks finished the regular season with a record of 46\u201336. The Bucks clinched the sixth seed and were eliminated in a seven-game series against the [[Atlanta Hawks]]. It was the farthest Milwaukee had gotten in the post-season since [[2001 NBA Playoffs|2001]]. The Bucks short playoff run was also in part due to Bogut suffering a broken arm after making an awkward fall after a dunk in a late-season game, thus ending his season. In the 2010\u201311 season, the Bucks finished ninth in the Eastern Conference, just out of reach of the playoffs.<ref>{{cite web|title=2010-2011 DIVISION STANDINGS|url=http://www.nba.com/standings/2010/team_record_comparison/conferenceNew_Std_Div.html|publisher=NBA Media Ventures, LLC|website=NBA.com|accessdate=May 16, 2013}}</ref>\n\nWith Bogut sidelined for the rest of the season and [[Stephen Jackson]] and head coach [[Scott Skiles]] not seeing eye-to-eye, the Bucks decided to trade both players. On March 13, 2012, 48 hours before the trade deadline, the Bucks traded Bogut and Jackson to the [[Golden State Warriors]] in exchange for [[Monta Ellis]], [[Ekpe Udoh]], and [[Kwame Brown]].\n\nBefore the [[2012 NBA draft]], the Bucks sent a first-round pick, [[Shaun Livingston]], [[Jon Brockman]], and [[Jon Leuer]] to the Houston Rockets for a first-round pick and [[Samuel Dalembert]]. In the 2012 draft, the Bucks selected [[Doron Lamb]] and [[John Henson (basketball)|John Henson]].\n\nAfter 32 games of the 2012\u201313 season, the Bucks fired Skiles, their coach since 2008. Jim Boylan was announced as the interim head coach and led the Bucks to a 22\u201328 record to finish the season at 38\u201344. The Bucks qualified as the eighth seed, where they were quickly swept 4\u20130 by the reigning, and eventual champions, the [[Miami Heat]].\n\n===2013\u2013present: Giannis Antetokounmpo era===\n[[File:Giannis Antetokoummpo (31669417562).jpg|200px|thumb|right|[[Giannis Antetokounmpo]]]]\n====2013\u20132014: under Larry Drew====\n[[Jim Boylan]] was relieved of his coaching duties and ex-Atlanta Hawks coach [[Larry Drew]] was hired. On June 27, 2013, the Bucks chose Greek forward [[Giannis Antetokounmpo]] with the 15th overall pick of the [[2013 NBA draft]]. They also traded the 43rd pick, Ricky Ledo, for [[Nate Wolters]]. In the 2013 free agency campaign, they brought in [[O. J. Mayo]], [[Carlos Delfino]], [[Zaza Pachulia]], and [[Gary Neal]] as well as seeing [[Monta Ellis]] opt out of the final year of his contract. The Bucks also agreed to sign-and-trade Brandon Jennings to the [[Detroit Pistons]] in exchange for [[Brandon Knight (basketball)|Brandon Knight]], [[Khris Middleton]], and [[Viacheslav Kravtsov]]. The Bucks later extended their contract with [[Larry Sanders (basketball)|Larry Sanders]] with a four-year, $44 million contract and traded [[Ish Smith]] and Kravtsov to the [[Phoenix Suns]] for [[Caron Butler]]. By the start of the 2013\u201314 season, the Bucks only had four players on their roster from the previous season. The season itself was a struggle, as the Bucks finished with the worst record in the league at 15\u201367, the worst record in team history.\n\nOn April 16, 2014, long-time Bucks owner Herb Kohl agreed to sell a majority interest of the team to New York-based billionaires [[Wes Edens]], and [[Marc Lasry]] for $550 million, but Kohl still retains a significant minority interest in the team. The new owners are expected to keep the team in Milwaukee, and are also expected to contribute $100 million toward building a new [[Wisconsin Entertainment and Sports Center|arena]] for the franchise.<ref>{{cite news|title=Bucks owner Kohl reaches deal to sell team|url=http://www.nba.com/2014/news/04/16/bucks-franchise-sold.ap/index.html?ls=iref:nbahpts|agency=[[Associated Press]]|publisher=NBA Media Ventures, LLC|website=NBA.com|date=April 16, 2014|accessdate=April 16, 2014}}</ref> Approval from the NBA Board of Governors came on May 15, a month later.<ref name=\"Charles F.

The Bucks then went on a stretch from January 24 to February 20, where they went 10\u20132. The Bucks beat the Sacramento Kings on February 11 for their 30th win of the year, and also became the first ever NBA team to double their win total from the previous season before the All-Star Break.\n\nOff the court, the Bucks made several changes to their roster, releasing Larry Sanders after several off-court incidents that led to multiple suspensions. On February 19, in the final minutes of the trade deadline, the Bucks became part of a 3-way deal with the Philadelphia 76ers and the Phoenix Suns, sending Brandon Knight, who was in the final year of his contract, to the Suns, and receiving reigning Rookie of the Year [[Michael Carter-Williams]], [[Miles Plumlee]], and [[Tyler Ennis (basketball)|Tyler Ennis]]. The Bucks also lost expected superstar Jabari Parker to a season-ending knee injury on December 15 in a game against the Phoenix Suns.\n\nOn January 25, the NBA passed the '[[Jay-Z]] Rule', prohibiting ownership groups from consisting of more than 25 individuals, and also mandating that no ownership interest in a team be smaller than 1%. Both Lasry and Edens had sold chunks of Bucks ownership to family, friends, and prominent members of the Milwaukee community.<ref>{{cite web|title=New NBA Rule Forbids Teams From Having More Than 25 Individual Owners|url=http://basketball.realgm.com/wiretap/236451/New-NBA-Rule-Forbids-Teams-From-Having-More-Than-25-Individual-Owners|website=RealGM Wiretap|publisher=RealGM Wiretap|accessdate=July 11, 2015|date=January 29, 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe Bucks finished the 2014\u201315 season with a 41\u201341 record. Their 26-game improvement from the previous season was the second highest in franchise history. The Bucks made the [[2015 NBA Playoffs]] as the 6th seed in the Eastern Conference, where they faced the [[Chicago Bulls]] in the first round, losing in six games.\n\nOn July 6, 2015, Bucks president Peter Feigin stated if public funding for a [[Wisconsin Entertainment and Sports Center|new arena]] falls through, the NBA may buy the team and move it to [[Las Vegas]] or [[Seattle]]. Current Bucks owners Wes Edens, Marc Lasry and Jamie Dinan combined with Herb Kohl to pledge $250 million for a new arena and sought a match from the public. Of those funds, $93 million would come from the Wisconsin Center District in the form of new debt on Milwaukee citizens. The district would not commence repaying the bonds until 13 years thereafter.<ref>{{cite web|last=Kass|first=Mark|title=Bucks' Feigin: If arena deal not approved, NBA will move team to 'Las Vegas or Seattle'|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/milwaukee/blog/2015/07/bucks-feigin-if-arena-dealnot-approved-nba-will.html?ana=twt|work=[[Milwaukee Business Journal]]|date=July 6, 2015|accessdate=October 3, 2015}}</ref>\n\nOn July 9, 2015, the Bucks confirmed their signing of center [[Greg Monroe]] to a three-year, $50 million contract. The Bucks also announced the club's re-signing of [[Khris Middleton]] to a five-year, $70 million contract.\n\nOn July 15, 2015, the future for the Bucks in Milwaukee was solidified after the Wisconsin State Senate voted 21\u201310 in favor of a proposal to use public money to help finance a new arena. The Bucks' new arena would replace the BMO Harris Bradley Center, which at the time was the third-oldest arena being used by an NBA team, behind [[Oracle Arena]], and [[Madison Square Garden]]. The Bradley Center opened in 1988, and had been used by the Bucks for 27 consecutive seasons.<ref>{{cite news|title=Bucks Statement on Wisconsin State Senate Vote|url=http://www.nba.com/bucks/release/bucks-statement-wisconsin-state-senate-vote|publisher=NBA Media Ventures, LLC|website=Bucks.com|date=July 15, 2015|accessdate=October 3, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Price|first=Satchel|title= Wisconsin State Senate Reaches Deal To Help Fund Milwaukee Bucks' New Arena|url=https://www.sbnation.com/2015/7/15/8970063/wisconsin-state-senate-milwaukee-bucks-arena-deal-public-money-funding-2015|publisher=[[SB Nation]]|date=July 15, 2015|accessdate=October 3, 2015}}</ref>\n\nOn the court, the young roster of the Bucks went through a step backward, to a 33\u201349 record in the 2015\u201316 season, though Giannis Antetokounmpo had an encouraging stretch in the final half of the season, accumulating 5 triple-doubles.\n\nOn June 18, 2016, ground was broken for the Bucks' new arena.<ref>{{cite news|title=Bucks Break Ground on New Multi-Purpose Arena|url=http://www.nba.com/bucks/release/bucks-break-ground-new-multi-purpose-arena/|publisher=NBA Media Ventures, LLC|website=Bucks.com|date=June 18, 2016|accessdate=June 26, 2016}}</ref>\n\nOn September 19, 2016, the Bucks and Giannis Antetokounmpo agreed to a 4-year, $100 million contract extension. In addition, the team would add new young improvements to the roster in drafting [[Thon Maker]] and [[Malcolm Brogdon]], and made trades to bring in [[Tony Snell (basketball)|Tony Snell]] and [[Michael Beasley]]. When the 2016\u201317 season began, the Bucks were without Khris Middleton, who suffered a torn hamstring during a practice. Even so, the Bucks remained competitive, staying around .500 for the first half of the season, with both Antetokounmpo and Jabari Parker leading the offense. While Parker missed making the All-Star team, Giannis was voted in as a starter, becoming the first Bucks All-Star since Michael Redd in 2004. In January, the Bucks slumped, though fans anticipated a turnaround with Middleton's return on February 8 against the Miami Heat. In the same game, however, Parker tore his ACL for the second time in 3 seasons, ending his season. Even so, Middleton's return still sparked a turnaround in March. During the month, the Bucks went 14\u20134, putting the team back in the thick of the playoff race. On April 8, 2017, the Bucks beat the Philadelphia 76ers 90\u201382, clinching the Bucks a playoff spot. On April 10, the Bucks beat the Charlotte Hornets 89\u201379 to clinch only the third winning season for the Bucks since 2001. The team finished the 2016\u201317 regular season with a 42\u201340 record. Giannis Antetokounmpo made history, becoming only the 5th player in NBA history to lead his team in all five major statistical categories, and was the first in NBA history to finish in the top 20 in the league in each category. The Bucks were the #6 seed in the Eastern Conference playoffs, and lost in the opening round to the Toronto Raptors, 4\u20132.\n\nOn May 23, 2017, Bucks general manager John Hammond stepped down to become general manager with the Orlando Magic.\n\nOn January 22, 2018, the Bucks fired [[Jason Kidd]], who had a 23\u201322 record in the 2017\u201318 season. In Kidd's three and a half seasons as head coach, the Bucks had a regular season record of 139\u2013152 and reached the first round of the NBA playoffs in the 2014\u201315 and 2016\u201317 seasons.<ref>{{cite news|title=Bucks Relieve Jason Kidd Of Head Coaching Duties|url=http://www.nba.com/bucks/news/bucks-relieve-jason-kidd-head-coaching-duties|publisher=NBA Media Ventures, LLC|website=Bucks.com|date=January 22, 2018|accessdate=January 23, 2018}}</ref> Bucks' assistant coach [[Joe Prunty]] was announced as Kidd's replacement on an interim basis for the rest of the season.<ref>{{cite news|last=Armas|first=Genaro C.|title=Milwaukee Bucks fire coach Jason Kidd|url=http://www.nba.com/article/2018/01/22/milwaukee-bucks-coach-jason-kidd-fired-report|publisher=NBA Media Ventures, LLC|website=NBA.com|date=January 22, 2018|accessdate=January 23, 2018}}</ref> Prunty finished the season with a 21\u201316 record, leading the Bucks to an overall 44\u201338 record, their best since the 2009\u201310 season.

The word \"Bango\" was originally coined by [[Eddie Doucette]], the longtime play-by-play announcer for the Bucks. Doucette used the word whenever a Bucks player connected on a long-range basket. It was often used for sharpshooter [[Jon McGlocklin]]. When it came time for the Bucks to choose a name for their new mascot, the name \"Bango\" won the contest.<ref>{{cite web |last1=McGee |first1=Adam |title=Milwaukee Bucks History: The Bango Origin Story |url=https://behindthebuckpass.com/2016/09/14/milwaukee-bucks-history-bango-origin-story/ |website=behindthebuckpass.com |accessdate=October 29, 2018 |date=September 14, 2016}}</ref>\n\nBango has been the Bucks' official mascot since on October 18, 1977, which was Milwaukee's home opener of the [[1977\u201378 NBA season|1977\u201378 season]]. In addition to the date being Bango's home debut, the game itself pitted Milwaukee against former Bucks center [[Kareem Abdul-Jabbar]] and his [[Los Angeles Lakers]] at the [[Milwaukee Arena]]. Bango has worked hard to become popular with Bucks fans throughout the state of Wisconsin over the years, appearing at schools, parades, and festivals as a goodwill ambassador for the team. His high-flying acrobatic layups, daring rebounds, and other entertaining antics still play an important role in energizing Bucks fans at the [[BMO Harris Bradley Center]]. Since 2001, Bango has also made perennial appearances at the [[NBA All-Star Game]].\n\nAt the 2009 All-Star Weekend in Phoenix, Arizona, Bango suffered an injury during a mascot-participative skit. While standing on one basket's rim, Bango's right leg slipped through the hoop, and he fell on the rim. He then slipped further and fell through the basket entirely. Bango tore his ACL due to the fall and was unable to perform for the remainder of the 2008\u201309 season, periodically making appearances at games in a wheelchair. A video of Bango's injury at the 2009 Mascot Challenge was uploaded onto [[YouTube]] shortly after the incident occurred.<ref name=\"bucky\">{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_VdySnHsJY|title=NBA mascot hits halfcourt shot off another mascot|via=YouTube|date=February 18, 2009|accessdate=May 16, 2013}}</ref>\n\nDuring game four of the 2009\u201310 [[2010 NBA Playoffs#(3) Atlanta Hawks vs. (6) Milwaukee Bucks|first-round playoff series between the Milwaukee Bucks and the Atlanta Hawks]], Bango successfully performed a back-flip dunk from the top of a 16-foot ladder, a feat similar to the [[Seattle SuperSonics]]' mascot [[Squatch]]'s feat during a March 19, 2008, game between the SuperSonics and the [[Phoenix Suns]].\n\nBango has also dunked the ball while in a human hamster wheel in 2012, and made a behind the back half court shot in New Orleans at the NBA All Star game.  In 2010 Bango was named Mascot of the Year, and later in 2011 was awarded, Most Awesome Mascot\", by Cartoon Network. Bango has also made so television experiences. He appeared in a ESPN commercial with Brandon Jenning in 2011, and the appeared in another ESPN commercial with Giannis Antetokounmpo in 2018. In 2013, Bango was features on a Hulu original documentary series called, ''Behind the Mask''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nba.com/bucks/entertainment/bango|title=Bango|website=Milwaukee Bucks|language=en|access-date=2020-04-03}}</ref> This documentary trials and tribulations of sports mascots.

The hunter green road uniforms featured the city name and numbers in white with red trim. The home white uniforms featured the team nickname and numbers in hunter green with red trim; the color scheme was reversed for the [[1971\u201372 NBA season|1971\u201372 season]]. In the [[1973\u201374 NBA season|1973\u201374 season]], the road uniforms featured a script \"Milwaukee\" and numbers in red with white trim; two seasons later they used the same design for their home uniforms. In the [[1975\u201376 NBA season|1975\u201376 season]] the road uniforms changed to the block \"Milwaukee\" lettering while retaining the script home uniform. The shorts featured the alternate Bucks logo on the left leg.\n\nCoinciding with the debut of [[Robert Indiana]]'s iconic [[UW\u2013Milwaukee Panther Arena|MECCA]] court in the [[1976\u201377 NBA season|1976\u201377 season]], the Bucks redesigned their uniforms. It now featured side stripes of kelly, lime and hunter green (a.k.a. the \"Irish Rainbows\"), inspired by the \"Rainbow Guts\" uniforms of the [[Houston Astros]]{{Citation needed|date=August 2015}}. Both the hunter green and white uniforms featured the streamlined \"Bucks\" lettering from the team logo and block lettering. They removed the color red prior to the [[1985\u201386 NBA season|1985\u201386 season]].\n\nThe Bucks changed their logo and uniforms for the [[1993\u201394 NBA season|1993\u201394 season]]. The purple road uniforms featured a modernized \"Bucks\" lettering from their logo and numbers in silver with hunter green trim, with green side stripes. The home white uniforms featured the same lettering and numbers in hunter green with silver trim, with purple side stripes. The stripes were extended to the jersey in the [[2001\u201302 NBA season|2001\u201302 season]].\n\n{| align=right\n|{{Basketball kit\n| align = right\n| pattern_b = _milwaukeebucks90s_road\n| pattern_s = _milwaukeebucks90s_road\n| body = ffffff\n| shorts = ffffff\n| title = 1995\u201399 Uniform\n}}\n|}\n\nIn the [[1995\u201396 NBA season|1995\u201396 season]] the Bucks unveiled a hunter green alternate uniform. The script \"Bucks\" lettering was in white fading to silver and purple and numbers were in white with green and purple trim. The uniform featured the graphic [[deer]] logo on the right side. They were retired after the [[1998\u201399 NBA season|1998\u201399 season]]. It would be resurrected for the [[2012\u201313 NBA season|2012\u201313 season]] during Hardwood Classics Nights, to updated uniform standards.\n\n[[File:BucksWordmark.png|right|thumb|150px|Milwaukee Bucks wordmark, 2006\u20132015.]]\nThe uniforms were changed again for the [[2006\u201307 NBA season|2006\u201307 season]]. The new home uniform was white with [[hunter green]] stripes on the sides. Inside each green stripe is a thinner red stripe that splits into two stripes near the shoulders. The numbers are green with a red outline. Milwaukee had two road uniforms as part of this set. The primary one was hunter green and a similar design to the home uniform with white numbers with a silver highlight and red outline. Both uniforms jerseys said \"BUCKS\" across the chest in beveled block letters, the 'B' and 'S' slightly larger than the rest of the letters. A secondary road uniform was introduced in the [[2008\u201309 NBA season|2008\u201309 season]]. Consisting of red jersey and shorts, it was made to resemble the 1968\u201373 uniforms. It says \"Milwaukee\" in white and silver writing, along with the numbers. The uniform set was tweaked for the [[2014\u201315 NBA season|2014\u201315 season]], with the addition of a gold tab commemorating their 1971 championship and the move of the NBA logo to the back. The 'Bucks' lettering was tweaked to make all the letters the same height.\n\nDuring the 2014\u201315 season, hints were made by the Bucks that their logo and uniforms were going to be redesigned. For one home game, it was anticipated that new uniforms were going to be revealed with [[Safety orange|hunter orange]] replacing red as the secondary color. It turned out to be an April Fool's joke, though the Bucks did announce that a new logo and colors would be revealed on April 13, 2015.<ref name=\"NewLogo\" />\n\nOn April 13, 2015, the Milwaukee Bucks unveiled new primary and secondary logos, as well as a new color scheme. The new branding will take effect beginning with the 2015\u201316 NBA season. The Bucks' new official colors are Good Land green (a reference to \"Milwaukee\" being supposedly based on an Algonquian word meaning \"The Good Land\"), Cream City cream (based on Milwaukee's old nickname of \"the [[Cream City brick|Cream City]]\", which came from the cream-colored bricks that were used for constructing many of Milwaukee's buildings back during the late 19th century), Great Lakes blue, black, and white.<ref name=\"NewLogo\" />\n\n[[File:Milwaukee Bucks wordmark 2015-current.png|right|thumb|150px|Milwaukee Bucks wordmark, 2015\u2013present.]]\n\nOn June 6, 2015, the Milwaukee Bucks unveiled their new home and road uniforms, to be worn beginning with the [[2015\u201316 NBA season|2015\u201316 season]]. The new uniforms remained white at home and green on the road, but red is now replaced by cream. The 'Milwaukee' city name also returned to the road uniforms for the first time since 1976. In addition, the jerseys feature a unique color block pattern on the sides, titled the \"Cream City Rainbow\". The pattern consists of the team's new colors of green, cream, royal blue and black, which the Bucks described as an homage to the \"Irish Rainbow\" design of the 1980s. Blue was also included inside the collar, representing Milwaukee and Wisconsin's \"blue collar\" citizens, while the inscription \"Fear the Deer\" was written on the bottom left upside down. The back collar features a small gold tab above the NBA logo, commemorating the Bucks' [[1971 NBA Finals|1971 NBA championship]].<ref>{{cite press release|title=BUCKS UNVEIL NEW HOME AND ROAD UNIFORMS|url=http://www.nba.com/bucks/release/bucks-unveil-new-home-and-road-uniforms|publisher=NBA Media Ventures, LLC|website=Bucks.com|date=June 6, 2015|accessdate=October 4, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=New Uniforms|url=http://www.nba.com/bucks/uniforms|publisher=NBA Media Ventures, LLC|website=Bucks.com|date=June 6, 2015|accessdate=October 4, 2015}}</ref>\n\nOn October 3, 2015, the Milwaukee Bucks unveiled a new black alternate uniform. The uniforms still feature the trim and the \"Cream City Rainbow\" on the sides, with the new Bucks logo in the center and the uniform number placed between the antlers of the logo. In conjunction with the unveiling of the uniform, dubbed the \"Fear the Deer uniform\", the team also unveiled a new alternate court design, a first in NBA history. The team planned to wear the black alternate uniform and play on the alternate court design for at least four (4) home games during the [[2015\u201316 NBA season|2015\u201316 season]].<ref>{{cite press release|title=Bucks Announce 'Fear the Deer' Nights Featuring Alternate Uniforms and an Alternate Court|url=http://www.nba.com/bucks/release/bucks-announce-fear-deer-nights-featuring-alternate-uniforms-and-alternate-court|publisher=NBA Media Ventures, LLC|website=Bucks.com|date=October 3, 2015|accessdate=October 5, 2015}}</ref>\n\nIn 2017, as part of the NBA's new protocol for uniforms, with each team allotted 5 different uniform sets, the Bucks added to their regular home (now \"Association\" white) and road (now \"Icon\" green) uniforms, as well as their alternate black (\"Statement\") uniforms. For their retro uniform, the Bucks went with a replica version of their inaugural home uniforms from 1968 to 1970, as part of the Bucks celebrating their 50th season in the NBA. In addition, the Bucks were also given new \"City\" uniforms, conceived by Nike as a way of commemorating each of the NBA teams' city history and pride. The \"City\" uniforms, dubbed \"Cream City\" uniforms, featured cream-colored jerseys and shorts, with the \"Cream City Rainbow\" running horizontally along the front of the uniform, with the Bucks logo in the middle. The \"Cream City Rainbow\" was also on the shorts, shaped in an \"M\" on both sides that are part of the regular Bucks' uniform design.\n\nFor the 2018\u201319 season, Milwaukee's \"City\" uniform will pay homage to Robert Indiana's famous MECCA court, featuring yellow, beige and red as base colors and light blue and forest green on the hem of the shorts. \"Bucks\" is written vertically on the right while the number is on the left; both are in forest green with lime green trim. The Bucks would also wear an \"Earned\" uniform by virtue of qualifying in the 2018 playoffs; this uniform is essentially the \"City\" uniform but with the visual elements of red with green stripes, inspired from the 1977\u20131985 \"Irish Rainbow\" home uniform.\n\nThe Bucks made slight updates to the black \"Statement\" uniform prior to the 2019\u201320 season. It was essentially a black version of the team's 2017\u201318 \"City\" uniform, with the exception of the \"Fear the Deer\" insignia on the beltline and near the jock tag.\n\nThe Bucks' 2019\u201320 \"City\" uniform again used a cream base, this time with a stylized \"Cream City\" wordmark in front. Blue, cream and green stripes run through the piping while a giant \"M\" insignia is featured on the shorts.\n\n==Season-by-season record==\n''List of the last five seasons completed by the Bucks.

In 2018 the Bucks agreed to a seven year extension with the network.<ref>{{cite web|title=Report: Milwaukee Bucks ink US$200m Fox Sports deal|url=https://www.sportspromedia.com/news/report-milwaukee-bucks-ink-us200m-fox-sports-wisconsin-deal|last=Carp|first=Sam|date=June 7, 2018|accessdate=January 29, 2019}}</ref> Selected games also air on the FS Wisconsin Plus feed, in case of [[Milwaukee Brewers]] conflicts. Bucks games produced by Fox Sports are also carried on the [[Fox Sports Go]] application within the team's broadcast territory.\n\nPrior to the Fox Sports Wisconsin exclusivity, the Bucks split their television broadcasts between FS Wisconsin (which through various incarnations have televised Bucks games since 1996) and [[WVTV-DT2|WCGV]] (Channel 24) from 1999 to 2007, and prior that, [[WVTV]] (Channel 18) was the over-the-air partner from 1994 to 1999. WCGV also previously carried Bucks games from 1988 to 1994, and WVTV again, this time from 1976 to 1988; these two stations are currently owned by the [[Sinclair Broadcast Group]]. The telecasts during each station's tenures as the over-the-air TV home of the Bucks consisted of almost exclusively road games; very few Bucks home games on either station were televised through the years, as the Bucks were one of the last NBA teams to regularly televise home games. The Bucks, along with their respective TV partners, co-produced and distributed the over-the-air telecasts to stations throughout Wisconsin.\n\nIn the franchise's early years, Bucks games were carried on then-[[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] affiliate [[WITI-TV|WITI]] (Channel 6), from 1968 to 1971, and on then-[[CBS]] affiliate [[WISN-TV]] (Channel 12) from 1971 to 1976; both respective runs also coincided with NBA coverage already carried by their networks at the time: [[NBA on ABC|ABC]] (1965\u20131973) and [[NBA on CBS|CBS]] (1973\u20131990). The two stations swapped networks in March 1977, with WISN since remaining with ABC, and WITI switching from CBS to [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] in December 1994.\n\nSince 1986, [[Jim Paschke]] has been the team's television play-by-play announcer, with former Buck [[Jon McGlocklin]] providing [[color commentary]] for the team from 1976 to 2018. From 2015 to 2018, veteran announcer [[Gus Johnson (sportscaster)|Gus Johnson]] called selected games alongside Paschke on a rotating basis. During that time, former Buck [[Marques Johnson]] also was in the booth for selected games, but became the new permanent color commentator for the 2018\u201319 season when the team moved to the [[Fiserv Forum]]. Veteran sportscaster [[Eddie Doucette]] served as the team's original play-by-play voice, working in that capacity from 1968 to 1984; he also called selected Bucks games on WITI, WISN-TV, and during most of WVTV's first tenure with the Bucks. He and McGlocklin also co-founded the [[MACC Fund|Midwest Athletes Against Childhood Cancer (MACC) Fund]] in 1976, which raises money to help cancer research.\n\nOn the radio side the team has been carried by [[WTMJ (AM)|WTMJ]] (620/103.3) and throughout the state on the [[Milwaukee Bucks Radio Network]] (which is sponsored by BMO Harris) for most of the team's history.

(Milwaukee Pro), a group headed by Wesley Pavalon and Marvin Fishman. A fan contest was held to name the new team, with over 40,000 fans participating.<ref>{{cite web |title=On This Day in 1968: Milwaukee Awarded an NBA Franchise |url=https://www.nba.com/bucks/features/milwaukee-awarded-nba-franchise-1968 |website=NBA.com |accessdate=December 10, 2019 |date=January 22, 2016}}</ref> While the most-voted fan entry was the ''Robins'', named for Wisconsin's state bird, the contest judges went with the second-most popular choice, the ''Bucks'', which was a reference to Wisconsin's official wild animal, the [[white-tailed deer]].

In October, the Bucks played their first NBA regular-season game against the [[Chicago Bulls]] before a [[Milwaukee Arena]] crowd of 8,467. As is typical with expansion teams, the Bucks' first season ([[1968\u201369 NBA season|1968\u201369]]) was a struggle. Their first victory came in their sixth game as the Bucks beat the [[Detroit Pistons]] 134\u2013118; they won only 26 more games in their first year. The Bucks' record that year earned them a coin flip against their expansion cousins, the [[Phoenix Suns]], to see who would get the first pick in the upcoming draft. It was considered a foregone conclusion that the first pick in the draft would be [[Kareem Abdul-Jabbar|Lew Alcindor]] of [[UCLA]]. The Bucks won the coin flip, but had to win a bidding war with the upstart [[American Basketball Association]] (ABA) to secure him.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nbaarena.com/en/teams/10/milwaukee-bucks |title=NBAarena.com: Teams&nbsp;\u2013 Milwaukee GENERAL INFORMATION |accessdate=January 29, 2012}}</ref>\n\n===1969\u20131975: The Kareem Abdul-Jabbar era===\n[[File:Kareem Abdul-Jabbar 1974.jpeg|thumb|175px|left|During his six seasons with the Bucks, Abdul-Jabbar averaged 30.4 points and 15.3 rebounds per game.]]\nDespite the Bucks' stroke of fortune in landing Alcindor, no one expected what happened in [[1969\u201370 NBA season|1969\u201370]]. They finished with a 56\u201326 record \u2013 a nearly exact reversal of the previous year and good enough for the second-best record in the league, behind the [[New York Knicks]]. The 29-game improvement was the best in league history \u2013 a record which would stand for 10 years until the [[Boston Celtics]] jumped from 29 wins in [[1978\u201379 NBA season|1978\u201379]] to 61 in [[1979\u201380 NBA season|1979\u201380]] (the difference again being a highly touted rookie, [[Larry Bird]]). The Bucks defeated the [[Philadelphia 76ers]] in five games in the Eastern semifinals, only to be dispatched in five by the Knicks in the Eastern finals. Alcindor was a runaway selection for [[NBA Rookie of the Year]].\n\n[[File:Oscar Robertson Bucks.jpeg|thumb|Robertson as a member of the Milwaukee Bucks]]\n[[1970\u201371 NBA season|The following season]], the Bucks got an unexpected gift when they acquired [[Oscar Robertson]], known as the \"Big O\", in a trade with the [[Cincinnati Royals]]. Subsequently, in only their third season, the Bucks finished 66\u201316 \u2013 the second-most wins in NBA history at the time, and still the most in franchise history. During the regular season, the Bucks recorded a then-NBA record [[List of National Basketball Association longest winning streaks|20-game win streak]]. They then steamrolled through the playoffs with a dominating 12\u20132 record, winning the NBA Championship on April 30, 1971, by sweeping the [[Baltimore Bullets (1963\u201373)|Baltimore Bullets]] in four games. By winning it all in only their third season, the Bucks became the fastest true expansion team in the history of North American sports to win a championship. As of 2018, it remains the only title in team history.\n\nThe Bucks remained a powerhouse for the first half of the 1970s. In 1972, Lew Alcindor converted to Islam and changed his name to [[Kareem Abdul-Jabbar]]. Milwaukee beat the Warriors in the playoffs 4\u20131, but lost the conference finals to Los Angeles 4\u20132. In 1973, they recorded their third consecutive 60-win season, the first NBA team to do so, but injuries resulted in an early playoff exit. The Bucks were back in the [[1974 NBA Finals]] against the [[Boston Celtics]]. In game six of the series, Abdul-Jabbar made his famous \"[[Hook shot|sky hook]]\" shot to end a classic double-overtime victory for the Bucks. The Bucks lost game seven and the series to the Celtics; as of 2018, they had not returned to the [[NBA Finals]]. As the 1974\u20131975 season began, Abdul-Jabbar suffered a hand injury and the team got off to a 3\u201313 start. After his return, other injuries befell Milwaukee, sending them to the bottom of their division with 38 wins and 44 losses. When the season ended, Abdul-Jabbar made the stunning announcement that he no longer wished to play for the Bucks. Desiring to play in a larger city, requesting a trade to either Los Angeles or New York City. The front office was unable to convince him otherwise and on June 16, 1975, the Bucks pulled a mega-trade by sending Abdul-Jabbar to the Lakers for [[Elmore Smith]], [[Junior Bridgeman]], [[Brian Winters]] and [[David Meyers (basketball)|David Meyers]]. The trade triggered a series of events that led to a change in the team's ownership. Minority owner and cable television executive [[Jim Fitzgerald]] opposed the trade and wanted to sell his stock. Although Fitzgerald was the team's largest single shareholder, he did not own enough stock to control the team.\n\n===1976\u20131979: Transition from Abdul-Jabbar===\nAfter the deal, the Bucks had several seasons in transition, but most of these players would go on to help the team. After being sold to Fitzgerald and several partners in 1976, the Bucks would enter into another era of greatness. It began with [[Don Nelson]] who became head coach in November 1976 after [[Larry Costello]] abruptly resigned. In the 1977 draft, the Bucks had three first round picks and drafted [[Kent Benson]], [[Marques Johnson]] and [[Ernie Grunfeld]]. Johnson would become a staple in the Bucks for years to come. Rookie [[Sidney Moncrief]] made his debut in 1979. Don Nelson went on to win two [[NBA Coach of the Year]] awards with the Bucks, both during seasons where the team won division titles, in 1983 and 1985.\n\nOn October 18, 1977, Abdul-Jabbar, playing with the Lakers, punched Benson during a game. Abdul-Jabbar broke his hand in the process.<ref>{{cite web|title=Walton Injury Opens Door for Bullets|url=http://www.nba.com/history/season/19771978.html|publisher=NBA Media Ventures, LLC|website=NBA.com|accessdate=June 30, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090314045723/http://www.nba.com/history/season/19771978.html|archive-date=March 14, 2009|url-status=dead}}</ref> Benson had been aggressive under the boards and Abdul-Jabbar, a [[martial arts]] [[blackbelt (martial arts)|blackbelt]], snapped. Abdul-Jabbar was fined $5,000 by the NBA and missed the next 20 games. Meanwhile, Benson never played as aggressively again and the Bucks traded him to the [[Detroit Pistons]] in 1980 for veteran center [[Bob Lanier (basketball)|Bob Lanier]] to fill in the hole left by the departure of Abdul-Jabbar. They then won the [[Midwest Division (NBA)|Midwest Division]] title in 1980. After losing to Seattle in the semi-finals, the Bucks moved to the [[Eastern Conference (NBA)|Eastern Conference]]'s [[Central Division (NBA)|Central Division]].\n\n===1979\u20131990: The Sidney Moncrief era===\nThere, they would win six straight division titles and have .500 seasons for the next 11 years. Within those years, the Bucks became perennial Eastern Conference contenders, primarily due to the strong play of Moncrief, [[Marques Johnson]], [[Paul Pressey]], [[Craig Hodges]] and the arrival of [[Terry Cummings]], [[Ricky Pierce]] and [[Jack Sikma]] from trades with the [[Los Angeles Clippers]] and [[Seattle SuperSonics]] respectively. However, the Bucks were unable to make it to the NBA Finals again, being eliminated by either the Celtics or the [[Philadelphia 76ers|Sixers]] each time.\n\nFor much of the 1970s the Bucks colors were forest green, deep red and white. In 1978, they added various shades of green to the uniforms, and in 1985, they eliminated red from the team colors.\n\nNoteworthy for the 1980s Bucks is that in [[1983 NBA Playoffs|1983]] they became the first, and until [[2003 NBA Playoffs|2003]], only team in NBA history to sweep the [[Boston Celtics]] in a best-of-seven playoff series, being the first team to meet and defeat [[Michael Jordan]] in [[1985 NBA Playoffs|a playoff series]] (during Jordan's rookie year), and hosting [[Julius Erving]]'s final NBA game in the [[1987 NBA Playoffs]], which would see the Bucks advancing with a game five first-round playoff victory.\n\n====Ownership and arena changes====\nIn 1985, Fitzgerald and his partners (one of which was Stuart Shadel) decided to sell the Bucks. He was having health problems and some of his investors wanted to get out. The Bucks were playing in the smallest arena in the NBA and the city did not want to build a new one. Milwaukee businessman and future U.S. Senator [[Herb Kohl]] bought the Bucks after fears that out-of-town investors could buy the team and move it out of Milwaukee. Before the transaction was complete, broadcaster [[Lloyd Pettit]] and his wife, [[Jane Bradley Pettit]], announced they were donating a new arena called the [[Bradley Center]]. In 2003, after considering selling the team, Kohl announced that he had decided against selling the Bucks to [[Michael Jordan]] and would \"continue to own them, improve them and commit them to remaining in Wisconsin\".\n\nOn May 21, 2012, the [[naming rights]] of the Bradley Center were sold to the [[BMO Harris Bank]] division of [[Bank of Montreal]], which had purchased the assets of [[M&I Bank]] a year earlier. After the heirs to the Bradley fortune gave their approval, the arena was renamed the \"BMO Harris Bradley Center\".<ref>{{cite press release|title=Milwaukee's Bradley Center Becomes the BMO Harris Bradley Center As Local \"Champions of the Community\" Come Forward to Support Jane Bradley Pettit's Gift|url=http://www.nba.com/bucks/release/milwaukees-bradley-center-becomes-bmo-harris-bradley-center-local-champions-community-come-f|publisher=NBA Media Ventures, LLC|website=Bucks.com|date=May 21, 2012|accessdate=October 3, 2015}}</ref>\n\n===1990\u20131998: Era of struggles===\n[[File:Toni Kukoc.jpg|left|thumb|150px|[[Toni Kuko\u010d]] playing for the Bucks.]]\nFor most of the 1990s, the Bucks franchise was mired in mediocrity under coaches [[Frank Hamblen]], [[Mike Dunleavy, Sr.|Mike Dunleavy]], and [[Chris Ford]]. From 1991 through 1998, the Bucks suffered a franchise-record seven straight losing seasons. During this period, the Bucks drafted [[Glenn Robinson]] with the first overall pick in the 1994 NBA Draft and in 1996 acquired rookie [[Ray Allen]] in a draft day trade with the [[Minnesota Timberwolves]]. Both players would have prominent roles in the Bucks resurgence during the late 1990s.\n\nAfter the franchise's 25th anniversary in 1993, the Bucks overhauled their logo and uniforms. The colors were green, purple, and silver. The old logo, which featured a cartoonish deer, was replaced in favor of a more realistic one. The primary color scheme was altered as well, when red was supplanted by purple. Purple road uniforms replaced the former green away uniforms.\n\nIn 1997, the Bucks sent all-star forward [[Vin Baker]] in a three-team trade to the [[Seattle SuperSonics]], and they would acquire [[Cleveland Cavaliers]] guard [[Terrell Brandon]] and forward [[Tyrone Hill]]. They also traded their 10th overall pick [[Danny Fortson]], guard [[Johnny Newman]], and center [[Joe Wolf]] to the [[Denver Nuggets]] for center [[Ervin Johnson]]. The 1997\u201398 Bucks finished their season with a 36\u201346 record, failing to make the playoffs for the seventh consecutive time.\n\n===1998\u20132003: Big Three era===\nAfter a decade of dwelling near the bottom of the NBA's standings, the Bucks looked to add credibility to their basketball operations. In 1998, the team hired veteran coach [[George Karl]], who had reached the [[NBA Finals]] with the [[Seattle SuperSonics]]. Under the leadership of Karl and general manager [[Ernie Grunfeld]], and with the steady addition of talent such as [[Tim Thomas (basketball)|Tim Thomas]] and [[Sam Cassell]], the Bucks developed into an elite team in the Eastern Conference. The nucleus of the \"big three\"\u2014consisting of [[Ray Allen]], Cassell, and Robinson\u2014along with Karl, created a successful renaissance era in Milwaukee. The team reached its zenith in 2000\u20132001, winning 52 games and their first division title in 15 years. The Bucks reached the 2001 Eastern Conference Finals by defeating the Charlotte Hornets. They lost the Eastern Conference finals in seven games to the 76ers.\n\nAfter coming within one game of an NBA Finals appearance in 2001, the Bucks sought to make key off-season player additions to put the team in the NBA Finals. Behind the strong encouragement of George Karl, the Bucks acquired forward [[Anthony Mason (basketball)|Anthony Mason]] at the beginning of the [[2001\u201302 NBA season|2001\u201302 season]]. On paper, this move made the Bucks the team to beat in the East. However, Mason battled with his weight and had a tough time finding his role.<ref>{{cite web|last=Markus|first=Don|title=Jury still out on Mason as plus/minus for Bucks|url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/2001-11-18/sports/0111180209_1_anthony-mason-milwaukee-bucks-karl|work=[[The Baltimore Sun]]|date=November 18, 2001|accessdate=November 18, 2001}}</ref> The Bucks, who at the season's midway point were the fourth seed in the Eastern Conference, went into a swoon in February and March. The collapse culminated with a loss to the [[Detroit Pistons]] on the final night of the season, which eliminated the Bucks from the playoffs and gave the division to the Pistons. The fallout created tension between Karl and the players, resulting in a trade of [[Glenn Robinson]] to Atlanta (for [[Toni Kuko\u010d]] and a 2003 first-round draft pick, used to select [[T. J. Ford]]).\n\nDuring the [[2002\u201303 NBA season|2002\u201303 season]], the Bucks traded Ray Allen and backup Ronald \"Flip\" Murray to the [[Seattle SuperSonics]] for [[Gary Payton]] and [[Desmond Mason]]. The trade allowed emerging star [[Michael Redd]] to see increased playing time, and with Payton in the backcourt, they finished the season with a 42\u201340 record. The Bucks made the playoffs, but lost in the first round to the [[New Jersey Nets]] in six games. That offseason, team leaders [[Sam Cassell]] and Ervin Johnson were traded to Minnesota (for [[Joe Smith (basketball)|Joe Smith]]). Payton left via free agency, after playing only 28 games for the Bucks. Karl's tenure also ended after the season. Within a one-year period, the team had lost the coach and players most responsible for the team's success during that era.\n\n===2003\u20132009: Michael Redd era===\n[[File:ReddBucks.jpg|right|thumb|150px|Michael Redd playing for the Bucks.]]\nUnder the direction of new general manager [[Larry Harris (basketball)|Larry Harris]], the Bucks struggled with inconsistency and injury for the next six years. During that period, they reached the playoffs twice, first under coach [[Terry Porter]] in [[2004 NBA Playoffs|2004]] and then under [[Terry Stotts]] in [[2006 NBA Playoffs|2006]]. In both instances, they were defeated by the [[Detroit Pistons]] in five games. During that period, [[Michael Redd]] blossomed into an all-star and a perimeter shooting threat, becoming the new \"face of the franchise\".<ref>{{cite web|last=Poust|first=Nick|url=http://bleacherreport.com/articles/993429-the-stardom-downfall-and-potential-resurrection-of-michael-redd|title=The stardom, downfall, and potential resurrection of Michael Redd|website=Bleacher Report|date=December 21, 2011|accessdate=April 25, 2015}}</ref> The Bucks received the first pick in the [[2005 NBA draft]], and used it to select center [[Andrew Bogut]]. Bogut struggled with both inconsistency and injuries in his first four years in Milwaukee, but over time became a key contributor to the Bucks.\n\nIn 2006, the team finished 40\u201342, last in their division, 24 games behind Detroit, but still made the playoffs in a season where every team in their division did. They were paired as the eighth seed versus the 64\u201318 conference-leading Pistons. They won game three at home, but lost the other four in a 4\u20131 series loss.\n\nAlso in March, the Bucks announced that they would not renew general manager [[Larry Harris (basketball)|Larry Harris]]'s contract, which was to expire in June. In April, the Bucks hired John Hammond, formerly vice-president of basketball operations for the Pistons, as their new general manager,<ref>{{cite news|title=Bucks name John Hammond General Manager|url=http://www.nba.com/bucks/news/hammond_named_general_manager_080411.html?rss=true|publisher=NBA Media Ventures, LLC|website=Bucks.com|date=April 11, 2008|accessdate=June 30, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081225045344/http://www.nba.com/bucks/news/hammond_named_general_manager_080411.html?rss=true|archive-date=December 25, 2008|url-status=dead}}</ref> giving the Milwaukee team a fresh director recently associated with success.\n\nAlso in April, the Bucks announced that [[Larry Krystkowiak]], the third and final head coach hired by Larry Harris, had been relieved of his duties. [[Scott Skiles]], formerly of the [[Chicago Bulls]] and [[Phoenix Suns]], became head coach.\n\nOn June 26, 2008, the Bucks acquired [[Richard Jefferson]] from the [[New Jersey Nets]] in a trade for 2007 first-round draft pick [[Yi Jianlian]] and [[Bobby Simmons]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/draft2008/news/story?id=3462210|title=Nets send top scorer Jefferson to Bucks for Yi, Simmons|publisher=ESPN|accessdate=June 30, 2015}}</ref> Later that day, the Bucks selected West Virginia's [[Joe Alexander (basketball)|Joe Alexander]] with the eighth pick of the NBA draft. Alexander was the first Taiwanese-born player in the NBA.\n\n===2009\u20132013: Arrival of Brandon Jennings===\n[[File:Jennings3 20091204.jpg|left|thumb|150px|Brandon Jennings]]\nIn the [[2009 NBA draft]], the Milwaukee Bucks selected point guard [[Brandon Jennings]], who had not gone to college but played in [[Lega Basket Serie A|Italy]] the previous year. Midway through the season, Bucks' general manager [[John Hammond (basketball)|John Hammond]] traded [[Hakim Warrick]] to the [[Chicago Bulls]], and acquired [[John Salmons]]. In a Bucks uniform, Salmons averaged a team-leading 19.9 points per game. The play of Jennings, along with the improvement of Andrew Bogut, the improved [[Ersan \u0130lyasova]], and the Salmons trade, catapulted the team to be a playoff contender. At the beginning of the season, the Bucks had low playoffs expectations; they had not been in four years.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vegasinsider.com/nba/scoreboard/previews/76ers-@-bucks.cfm/date/03-24-10|title=NBA Previews for the Philadelphia 76ers vs. Milwaukee Bucks Matchup|publisher=Vegas Insider|date=March 24, 2010|accessdate=April 25, 2015}}</ref> In October, the Bucks quickly fell behind the [[Cleveland Cavaliers]] in the Central Division, but Milwaukee ultimately clinched a playoff berth on April 6, 2010, with a road win over the [[Chicago Bulls]]. It was during that time that the phrase ''\"Fear the Deer\"'' started, most likely by an ESPN commentator, and adopted on message boards and within Andrew Bogut's Squad 6.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jsonline.com/blogs/business/89079357.html|title='Fear the Deer' is catching on|author=Don Walker|accessdate=June 30, 2015}}</ref> The slogan rang well with Bucks fans, who started bringing signs with the phrase to games. The slogan became the team's battle cry in the NBA playoffs. The Bucks finished the regular season with a record of 46\u201336. The Bucks clinched the sixth seed and were eliminated in a seven-game series against the [[Atlanta Hawks]]. It was the farthest Milwaukee had gotten in the post-season since [[2001 NBA Playoffs|2001]]. The Bucks short playoff run was also in part due to Bogut suffering a broken arm after making an awkward fall after a dunk in a late-season game, thus ending his season. In the 2010\u201311 season, the Bucks finished ninth in the Eastern Conference, just out of reach of the playoffs.<ref>{{cite web|title=2010-2011 DIVISION STANDINGS|url=http://www.nba.com/standings/2010/team_record_comparison/conferenceNew_Std_Div.html|publisher=NBA Media Ventures, LLC|website=NBA.com|accessdate=May 16, 2013}}</ref>\n\nWith Bogut sidelined for the rest of the season and [[Stephen Jackson]] and head coach [[Scott Skiles]] not seeing eye-to-eye, the Bucks decided to trade both players. On March 13, 2012, 48 hours before the trade deadline, the Bucks traded Bogut and Jackson to the [[Golden State Warriors]] in exchange for [[Monta Ellis]], [[Ekpe Udoh]], and [[Kwame Brown]].\n\nBefore the [[2012 NBA draft]], the Bucks sent a first-round pick, [[Shaun Livingston]], [[Jon Brockman]], and [[Jon Leuer]] to the Houston Rockets for a first-round pick and [[Samuel Dalembert]]. In the 2012 draft, the Bucks selected [[Doron Lamb]] and [[John Henson (basketball)|John Henson]].\n\nAfter 32 games of the 2012\u201313 season, the Bucks fired Skiles, their coach since 2008. Jim Boylan was announced as the interim head coach and led the Bucks to a 22\u201328 record to finish the season at 38\u201344. The Bucks qualified as the eighth seed, where they were quickly swept 4\u20130 by the reigning, and eventual champions, the [[Miami Heat]].\n\n===2013\u2013present: Giannis Antetokounmpo era===\n[[File:Giannis Antetokoummpo (31669417562).jpg|200px|thumb|right|[[Giannis Antetokounmpo]]]]\n====2013\u20132014: under Larry Drew====\n[[Jim Boylan]] was relieved of his coaching duties and ex-Atlanta Hawks coach [[Larry Drew]] was hired. On June 27, 2013, the Bucks chose Greek forward [[Giannis Antetokounmpo]] with the 15th overall pick of the [[2013 NBA draft]]. They also traded the 43rd pick, Ricky Ledo, for [[Nate Wolters]]. In the 2013 free agency campaign, they brought in [[O. J. Mayo]], [[Carlos Delfino]], [[Zaza Pachulia]], and [[Gary Neal]] as well as seeing [[Monta Ellis]] opt out of the final year of his contract. The Bucks also agreed to sign-and-trade Brandon Jennings to the [[Detroit Pistons]] in exchange for [[Brandon Knight (basketball)|Brandon Knight]], [[Khris Middleton]], and [[Viacheslav Kravtsov]]. The Bucks later extended their contract with [[Larry Sanders (basketball)|Larry Sanders]] with a four-year, $44 million contract and traded [[Ish Smith]] and Kravtsov to the [[Phoenix Suns]] for [[Caron Butler]]. By the start of the 2013\u201314 season, the Bucks only had four players on their roster from the previous season. The season itself was a struggle, as the Bucks finished with the worst record in the league at 15\u201367, the worst record in team history.\n\nOn April 16, 2014, long-time Bucks owner Herb Kohl agreed to sell a majority interest of the team to New York-based billionaires [[Wes Edens]], and [[Marc Lasry]] for $550 million, but Kohl still retains a significant minority interest in the team. The new owners are expected to keep the team in Milwaukee, and are also expected to contribute $100 million toward building a new [[Wisconsin Entertainment and Sports Center|arena]] for the franchise.<ref>{{cite news|title=Bucks owner Kohl reaches deal to sell team|url=http://www.nba.com/2014/news/04/16/bucks-franchise-sold.ap/index.html?ls=iref:nbahpts|agency=[[Associated Press]]|publisher=NBA Media Ventures, LLC|website=NBA.com|date=April 16, 2014|accessdate=April 16, 2014}}</ref> Approval from the NBA Board of Governors came on May 15, a month later.<ref name=\"Charles F.

The Bucks then went on a stretch from January 24 to February 20, where they went 10\u20132. The Bucks beat the Sacramento Kings on February 11 for their 30th win of the year, and also became the first ever NBA team to double their win total from the previous season before the All-Star Break.\n\nOff the court, the Bucks made several changes to their roster, releasing Larry Sanders after several off-court incidents that led to multiple suspensions. On February 19, in the final minutes of the trade deadline, the Bucks became part of a 3-way deal with the Philadelphia 76ers and the Phoenix Suns, sending Brandon Knight, who was in the final year of his contract, to the Suns, and receiving reigning Rookie of the Year [[Michael Carter-Williams]], [[Miles Plumlee]], and [[Tyler Ennis (basketball)|Tyler Ennis]]. The Bucks also lost expected superstar Jabari Parker to a season-ending knee injury on December 15 in a game against the Phoenix Suns.\n\nOn January 25, the NBA passed the '[[Jay-Z]] Rule', prohibiting ownership groups from consisting of more than 25 individuals, and also mandating that no ownership interest in a team be smaller than 1%. Both Lasry and Edens had sold chunks of Bucks ownership to family, friends, and prominent members of the Milwaukee community.<ref>{{cite web|title=New NBA Rule Forbids Teams From Having More Than 25 Individual Owners|url=http://basketball.realgm.com/wiretap/236451/New-NBA-Rule-Forbids-Teams-From-Having-More-Than-25-Individual-Owners|website=RealGM Wiretap|publisher=RealGM Wiretap|accessdate=July 11, 2015|date=January 29, 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe Bucks finished the 2014\u201315 season with a 41\u201341 record.

Current Bucks owners Wes Edens, Marc Lasry and Jamie Dinan combined with Herb Kohl to pledge $250 million for a new arena and sought a match from the public. Of those funds, $93 million would come from the Wisconsin Center District in the form of new debt on Milwaukee citizens.

When the 2016\u201317 season began, the Bucks were without Khris Middleton, who suffered a torn hamstring during a practice. Even so, the Bucks remained competitive, staying around .500 for the first half of the season, with both Antetokounmpo and Jabari Parker leading the offense. While Parker missed making the All-Star team, Giannis was voted in as a starter, becoming the first Bucks All-Star since Michael Redd in 2004. In January, the Bucks slumped, though fans anticipated a turnaround with Middleton's return on February 8 against the Miami Heat. In the same game, however, Parker tore his ACL for the second time in 3 seasons, ending his season. Even so, Middleton's return still sparked a turnaround in March.

The word \"Bango\" was originally coined by [[Eddie Doucette]], the longtime play-by-play announcer for the Bucks. Doucette used the word whenever a Bucks player connected on a long-range basket. It was often used for sharpshooter [[Jon McGlocklin]]. When it came time for the Bucks to choose a name for their new mascot, the name \"Bango\" won the contest.<ref>{{cite web |last1=McGee |first1=Adam |title=Milwaukee Bucks History: The Bango Origin Story |url=https://behindthebuckpass.com/2016/09/14/milwaukee-bucks-history-bango-origin-story/ |website=behindthebuckpass.com |accessdate=October 29, 2018 |date=September 14, 2016}}</ref>\n\nBango has been the Bucks' official mascot since on October 18, 1977, which was Milwaukee's home opener of the [[1977\u201378 NBA season|1977\u201378 season]]. In addition to the date being Bango's home debut, the game itself pitted Milwaukee against former Bucks center [[Kareem Abdul-Jabbar]] and his [[Los Angeles Lakers]] at the [[Milwaukee Arena]]. Bango has worked hard to become popular with Bucks fans throughout the state of Wisconsin over the years, appearing at schools, parades, and festivals as a goodwill ambassador for the team. His high-flying acrobatic layups, daring rebounds, and other entertaining antics still play an important role in energizing Bucks fans at the [[BMO Harris Bradley Center]]. Since 2001, Bango has also made perennial appearances at the [[NBA All-Star Game]].\n\nAt the 2009 All-Star Weekend in Phoenix, Arizona, Bango suffered an injury during a mascot-participative skit. While standing on one basket's rim, Bango's right leg slipped through the hoop, and he fell on the rim. He then slipped further and fell through the basket entirely. Bango tore his ACL due to the fall and was unable to perform for the remainder of the 2008\u201309 season, periodically making appearances at games in a wheelchair. A video of Bango's injury at the 2009 Mascot Challenge was uploaded onto [[YouTube]] shortly after the incident occurred.<ref name=\"bucky\">{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_VdySnHsJY|title=NBA mascot hits halfcourt shot off another mascot|via=YouTube|date=February 18, 2009|accessdate=May 16, 2013}}</ref>\n\nDuring game four of the 2009\u201310 [[2010 NBA Playoffs#(3) Atlanta Hawks vs. (6) Milwaukee Bucks|first-round playoff series between the Milwaukee Bucks and the Atlanta Hawks]], Bango successfully performed a back-flip dunk from the top of a 16-foot ladder, a feat similar to the [[Seattle SuperSonics]]' mascot [[Squatch]]'s feat during a March 19, 2008, game between the SuperSonics and the [[Phoenix Suns]].\n\nBango has also dunked the ball while in a human hamster wheel in 2012, and made a behind the back half court shot in New Orleans at the NBA All Star game.  In 2010 Bango was named Mascot of the Year, and later in 2011 was awarded, Most Awesome Mascot\", by Cartoon Network. Bango has also made so television experiences. He appeared in a ESPN commercial with Brandon Jenning in 2011, and the appeared in another ESPN commercial with Giannis Antetokounmpo in 2018.

The hunter green road uniforms featured the city name and numbers in white with red trim. The home white uniforms featured the team nickname and numbers in hunter green with red trim; the color scheme was reversed for the [[1971\u201372 NBA season|1971\u201372 season]]. In the [[1973\u201374 NBA season|1973\u201374 season]], the road uniforms featured a script \"Milwaukee\" and numbers in red with white trim; two seasons later they used the same design for their home uniforms. In the [[1975\u201376 NBA season|1975\u201376 season]] the road uniforms changed to the block \"Milwaukee\" lettering while retaining the script home uniform. The shorts featured the alternate Bucks logo on the left leg.\n\nCoinciding with the debut of [[Robert Indiana]]'s iconic [[UW\u2013Milwaukee Panther Arena|MECCA]] court in the [[1976\u201377 NBA season|1976\u201377 season]], the Bucks redesigned their uniforms. It now featured side stripes of kelly, lime and hunter green (a.k.a. the \"Irish Rainbows\"), inspired by the \"Rainbow Guts\" uniforms of the [[Houston Astros]]{{Citation needed|date=August 2015}}. Both the hunter green and white uniforms featured the streamlined \"Bucks\" lettering from the team logo and block lettering. They removed the color red prior to the [[1985\u201386 NBA season|1985\u201386 season]].\n\nThe Bucks changed their logo and uniforms for the [[1993\u201394 NBA season|1993\u201394 season]]. The purple road uniforms featured a modernized \"Bucks\" lettering from their logo and numbers in silver with hunter green trim, with green side stripes. The home white uniforms featured the same lettering and numbers in hunter green with silver trim, with purple side stripes. The stripes were extended to the jersey in the [[2001\u201302 NBA season|2001\u201302 season]].\n\n{| align=right\n|{{Basketball kit\n| align = right\n| pattern_b = _milwaukeebucks90s_road\n| pattern_s = _milwaukeebucks90s_road\n| body = ffffff\n| shorts = ffffff\n| title = 1995\u201399 Uniform\n}}\n|}\n\nIn the [[1995\u201396 NBA season|1995\u201396 season]] the Bucks unveiled a hunter green alternate uniform. The script \"Bucks\" lettering was in white fading to silver and purple and numbers were in white with green and purple trim. The uniform featured the graphic [[deer]] logo on the right side. They were retired after the [[1998\u201399 NBA season|1998\u201399 season]]. It would be resurrected for the [[2012\u201313 NBA season|2012\u201313 season]] during Hardwood Classics Nights, to updated uniform standards.\n\n[[File:BucksWordmark.png|right|thumb|150px|Milwaukee Bucks wordmark, 2006\u20132015.]]\nThe uniforms were changed again for the [[2006\u201307 NBA season|2006\u201307 season]]. The new home uniform was white with [[hunter green]] stripes on the sides. Inside each green stripe is a thinner red stripe that splits into two stripes near the shoulders. The numbers are green with a red outline. Milwaukee had two road uniforms as part of this set. The primary one was hunter green and a similar design to the home uniform with white numbers with a silver highlight and red outline. Both uniforms jerseys said \"BUCKS\" across the chest in beveled block letters, the 'B' and 'S' slightly larger than the rest of the letters. A secondary road uniform was introduced in the [[2008\u201309 NBA season|2008\u201309 season]]. Consisting of red jersey and shorts, it was made to resemble the 1968\u201373 uniforms. It says \"Milwaukee\" in white and silver writing, along with the numbers. The uniform set was tweaked for the [[2014\u201315 NBA season|2014\u201315 season]], with the addition of a gold tab commemorating their 1971 championship and the move of the NBA logo to the back. The 'Bucks' lettering was tweaked to make all the letters the same height.\n\nDuring the 2014\u201315 season, hints were made by the Bucks that their logo and uniforms were going to be redesigned. For one home game, it was anticipated that new uniforms were going to be revealed with [[Safety orange|hunter orange]] replacing red as the secondary color. It turned out to be an April Fool's joke, though the Bucks did announce that a new logo and colors would be revealed on April 13, 2015.<ref name=\"NewLogo\" />\n\nOn April 13, 2015, the Milwaukee Bucks unveiled new primary and secondary logos, as well as a new color scheme. The new branding will take effect beginning with the 2015\u201316 NBA season. The Bucks' new official colors are Good Land green (a reference to \"Milwaukee\" being supposedly based on an Algonquian word meaning \"The Good Land\"), Cream City cream (based on Milwaukee's old nickname of \"the [[Cream City brick|Cream City]]\", which came from the cream-colored bricks that were used for constructing many of Milwaukee's buildings back during the late 19th century), Great Lakes blue, black, and white.<ref name=\"NewLogo\" />\n\n[[File:Milwaukee Bucks wordmark 2015-current.png|right|thumb|150px|Milwaukee Bucks wordmark, 2015\u2013present.]]\n\nOn June 6, 2015, the Milwaukee Bucks unveiled their new home and road uniforms, to be worn beginning with the [[2015\u201316 NBA season|2015\u201316 season]]. The new uniforms remained white at home and green on the road, but red is now replaced by cream. The 'Milwaukee' city name also returned to the road uniforms for the first time since 1976. In addition, the jerseys feature a unique color block pattern on the sides, titled the \"Cream City Rainbow\". The pattern consists of the team's new colors of green, cream, royal blue and black, which the Bucks described as an homage to the \"Irish Rainbow\" design of the 1980s. Blue was also included inside the collar, representing Milwaukee and Wisconsin's \"blue collar\" citizens, while the inscription \"Fear the Deer\" was written on the bottom left upside down. The back collar features a small gold tab above the NBA logo, commemorating the Bucks' [[1971 NBA Finals|1971 NBA championship]].<ref>{{cite press release|title=BUCKS UNVEIL NEW HOME AND ROAD UNIFORMS|url=http://www.nba.com/bucks/release/bucks-unveil-new-home-and-road-uniforms|publisher=NBA Media Ventures, LLC|website=Bucks.com|date=June 6, 2015|accessdate=October 4, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=New Uniforms|url=http://www.nba.com/bucks/uniforms|publisher=NBA Media Ventures, LLC|website=Bucks.com|date=June 6, 2015|accessdate=October 4, 2015}}</ref>\n\nOn October 3, 2015, the Milwaukee Bucks unveiled a new black alternate uniform.

In conjunction with the unveiling of the uniform, dubbed the \"Fear the Deer uniform\", the team also unveiled a new alternate court design, a first in NBA history. The team planned to wear the black alternate uniform and play on the alternate court design for at least four (4) home games during the [[2015\u201316 NBA season|2015\u201316 season]].<ref>{{cite press release|title=Bucks Announce 'Fear the Deer' Nights Featuring Alternate Uniforms and an Alternate Court|url=http://www.nba.com/bucks/release/bucks-announce-fear-deer-nights-featuring-alternate-uniforms-and-alternate-court|publisher=NBA Media Ventures, LLC|website=Bucks.com|date=October 3, 2015|accessdate=October 5, 2015}}</ref>\n\nIn 2017, as part of the NBA's new protocol for uniforms, with each team allotted 5 different uniform sets, the Bucks added to their regular home (now \"Association\" white) and road (now \"Icon\" green) uniforms, as well as their alternate black (\"Statement\") uniforms. For their retro uniform, the Bucks went with a replica version of their inaugural home uniforms from 1968 to 1970, as part of the Bucks celebrating their 50th season in the NBA. In addition, the Bucks were also given new \"City\" uniforms, conceived by Nike as a way of commemorating each of the NBA teams' city history and pride. The \"City\" uniforms, dubbed \"Cream City\" uniforms, featured cream-colored jerseys and shorts, with the \"Cream City Rainbow\" running horizontally along the front of the uniform, with the Bucks logo in the middle. The \"Cream City Rainbow\" was also on the shorts, shaped in an \"M\" on both sides that are part of the regular Bucks' uniform design.\n\nFor the 2018\u201319 season, Milwaukee's \"City\" uniform will pay homage to Robert Indiana's famous MECCA court, featuring yellow, beige and red as base colors and light blue and forest green on the hem of the shorts. \"Bucks\" is written vertically on the right while the number is on the left; both are in forest green with lime green trim. The Bucks would also wear an \"Earned\" uniform by virtue of qualifying in the 2018 playoffs; this uniform is essentially the \"City\" uniform but with the visual elements of red with green stripes, inspired from the 1977\u20131985 \"Irish Rainbow\" home uniform.\n\nThe Bucks made slight updates to the black \"Statement\" uniform prior to the 2019\u201320 season. It was essentially a black version of the team's 2017\u201318 \"City\" uniform, with the exception of the \"Fear the Deer\" insignia on the beltline and near the jock tag.\n\nThe Bucks' 2019\u201320 \"City\" uniform again used a cream base, this time with a stylized \"Cream City\" wordmark in front. Blue, cream and green stripes run through the piping while a giant \"M\" insignia is featured on the shorts.\n\n==Season-by-season record==\n''List of the last five seasons completed by the Bucks.

Bucks games produced by Fox Sports are also carried on the [[Fox Sports Go]] application within the team's broadcast territory.\n\nPrior to the Fox Sports Wisconsin exclusivity, the Bucks split their television broadcasts between FS Wisconsin (which through various incarnations have televised Bucks games since 1996) and [[WVTV-DT2|WCGV]] (Channel 24) from 1999 to 2007, and prior that, [[WVTV]] (Channel 18) was the over-the-air partner from 1994 to 1999. WCGV also previously carried Bucks games from 1988 to 1994, and WVTV again, this time from 1976 to 1988; these two stations are currently owned by the [[Sinclair Broadcast Group]]. The telecasts during each station's tenures as the over-the-air TV home of the Bucks consisted of almost exclusively road games; very few Bucks home games on either station were televised through the years, as the Bucks were one of the last NBA teams to regularly televise home games. The Bucks, along with their respective TV partners, co-produced and distributed the over-the-air telecasts to stations throughout Wisconsin.\n\nIn the franchise's early years, Bucks games were carried on then-[[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] affiliate [[WITI-TV|WITI]] (Channel 6), from 1968 to 1971, and on then-[[CBS]] affiliate [[WISN-TV]] (Channel 12) from 1971 to 1976; both respective runs also coincided with NBA coverage already carried by their networks at the time: [[NBA on ABC|ABC]] (1965\u20131973) and [[NBA on CBS|CBS]] (1973\u20131990). The two stations swapped networks in March 1977, with WISN since remaining with ABC, and WITI switching from CBS to [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] in December 1994.\n\nSince 1986, [[Jim Paschke]] has been the team's television play-by-play announcer, with former Buck [[Jon McGlocklin]] providing [[color commentary]] for the team from 1976 to 2018. From 2015 to 2018, veteran announcer [[Gus Johnson (sportscaster)|Gus Johnson]] called selected games alongside Paschke on a rotating basis. During that time, former Buck [[Marques Johnson]] also was in the booth for selected games, but became the new permanent color commentator for the 2018\u201319 season when the team moved to the [[Fiserv Forum]]. Veteran sportscaster [[Eddie Doucette]] served as the team's original play-by-play voice, working in that capacity from 1968 to 1984; he also called selected Bucks games on WITI, WISN-TV, and during most of WVTV's first tenure with the Bucks. He and McGlocklin also co-founded the [[MACC Fund|Midwest Athletes Against Childhood Cancer (MACC) Fund]] in 1976, which raises money to help cancer research.\n\nOn the radio side the team has been carried by [[WTMJ (AM)|WTMJ]] (620/103.3) and throughout the state on the [[Milwaukee Bucks Radio Network]] (which is sponsored by BMO Harris) for most of the team's history.

In [[UniPro]], the OSI Physical Layer is split into two sublayers: Layer 1 (the actual physical layer) and Layer 1.5 (the PHY Adapter layer) which abstracts from differences between alternative Layer 1 technologies. The actual physical layer is a separate specification as the various PHY options are reused<ref>[http://www.mipi.org/specifications Overview of MIPI specifications], D-PHY is used in the DSI, CSI, and UniPro specifications, M-PHY is used in the UniPro, DigRFv4 and LLI specifications</ref> in other [[Mobile Industry Processor Interface|MIPI Alliance]] specifications.\n\n{| border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"3\" style=\"margin: 1em auto 1em auto\"\n|+ ''UniPro protocol stack (this color-coding is a long-standing UniPro tradition)''\n|- style=\"background:#D8D8D8; color:black\"\n! colspan=\"2\" | Layer # || Layer name || Functionality || Data unit name\n|- style=\"background:#7DD460; color:black\"\n| align=\"center\" colspan=\"2\" | LA\n| align=\"center\" | Application\n| Payload and transaction semantics\n| align=\"center\" | Message\n|- style=\"background:#D8D8D8; color:black\" \n| align=\"center\" rowspan=\"5\" | DME\n|- style=\"background:#C2FA31; color:black\"\n| align=\"center\" | Layer 4\n| align=\"center\" | Transport\n| Ports, multiplexing, flow control\n| align=\"center\" | Segment\n|-style=\"background:#FAF931; color:black\"\n| align=\"center\" | Layer 3\n| align=\"center\" | Network\n| Addressing, routing\n| align=\"center\" | Packet\n|- style=\"background:#FF9400; color:black\"\n| align=\"center\" | Layer 2\n| align=\"center\" | Data link\n| Single-hop reliability and priority-based arbitration\n| align=\"center\" | Frame\n|- style=\"background:#FF1804; color:white\"\n| align=\"center\" | Layer 1.5\n| align=\"center\" | PHY adapter\n| Physical layer abstraction and multi-lane support\n| align=\"center\" | UniPro symbol\n|- style=\"background:#FF1804; color:white\"\n| align=\"center\" colspan=\"2\" | Layer 1\n| align=\"center\" | Physical layer (PHY)\n| Signaling, clocking, line encoding, power modes\n| align=\"center\" | PHY symbol\n|}\n\nThe UniPro specification itself covers Layers 1.5, 2, 3, 4 and the DME (Device Management Entity). The Application Layer (LA) is out of scope because different uses of UniPro will require different LA protocols. The Physical Layer (L1) is covered in separate MIPI specifications in order to allow the PHY to be reused by other (less generic) protocols if needed.\n\nOSI Layers 5 (Session) and 6 (Presentation) are, where applicable, counted as part of the Application Layer.\n\n==Physical Layer (L1)==\n\n===D-PHY===\nVersions 1.0 and 1.1 of UniPro use MIPI's [[D-PHY]] technology for the off-chip Physical Layer. This PHY allows inter-chip communication. Data rates of the D-PHY are variable, but are in the range of 500-1000 Mbit/s (lower speeds are supported, but at decreased power efficiency). The D-PHY was named after the Roman number for 500 (\"D\").\n\nThe [[D-PHY]]<ref>[https://members.mipi.org/mipi-adopters/file-fix/Specifications/Board%20Approved/mipi_D-PHY_specification_v01-00-00.pdf MIPI Alliance Specification for D-PHY v1.00.00], requires an account at the MIPI website</ref> uses differential signaling to convey PHY symbols over micro-stripline wiring. A second differential signal pair is used to transmit the associated clock signal from the source to the destination. The D-PHY technology thus uses a total of 2 clock wires per direction plus 2 signal wires per lane and per direction. For example, a D-PHY might use 2 wires for the clock and 4 wires (2 lanes) for the data in the forward direction, but 2 wires for the clock and 6 wires (3 lanes) for the data in the reverse direction. Data traffic in the forward and reverse directions are totally independent at this level of the protocol stack.\n\nIn UniPro, the D-PHY is used in a mode (called \"8b9b\" encoding) which conveys 8-bit bytes as 9-bit symbols. The UniPro protocol uses this to represent special control symbols (outside the usual 0 to 255 values). The PHY itself uses this to represent certain special symbols that have meaning to the PHY itself (e.g. IDLE symbols). Note that the ratio 8:9 can cause some confusion when specifying the data rate of the D-PHY: a PHY implementation running with a 450&nbsp;MHz clock frequency is often rated as a 900 Mbit/s PHY, while only 800 Mbit/s is then available for the UniPro stack.\n\nThe D-PHY also supports a Low-Power Data Transmission (LPDT) mode and various other low-power modes for use when no data needs to be sent.\n\n==={{Anchor|M-PHY}}M-PHY===\nVersions 1.4 and beyond of UniPro support both the [[D-PHY]] as well as [[M-PHY]]<ref>[https://members.mipi.org/mipi-adopters/file-fix/Specifications/Board%20Approved/mipi_M-PHY_specification_v1-00-00.pdf MIPI Specification for M-PHY version 1.00.00], requires an account at the MIPI website</ref> technology. The M-PHY technology is still in draft status, but supports high-speed data rates starting at about 1000 Mbit/s (the M-PHY was named after the Roman number for 1000). In addition to higher speeds, the M-PHY will use fewer signal wires because the clock signal is embedded with the data through the use of industry-standard [[8B/10B encoding|8b10b encoding]]. Again, a PHY capable of transmitting user data at 1000 Mbit/s is typically specified as being in 1250 Mbit/s mode due to the 8b10b encoding.\n\n{| border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"3\" style=\"margin: 1em auto 1em auto\"\n|+ ''Physical layer technologies supported by UniPro''\n|- style=\"background:#D8D8D8; color:black\"\n!

D-PHY is a less complex technology, M-PHY provides higher bandwidths with fewer signal wires, and C-PHY provides low-power.\n\n===Low speed modes and power savings===\n\nIt is worth noting that UniPro supports the power efficient low speed communication modes provided by both the D-PHY (10 Mbit/s) and M-PHY (3 Mbit/sec up to 500 Mbit/s). In these modes, power consumption roughly scales with the amount of data that is sent.\nFurthermore, both PHY technologies provide additional power saving modes because they were optimized for use in battery-powered devices.\n\n==PHY Adapter Layer (L1.5)==\n\nArchitecturally, the PHY Adapter layer serves to hide the differences between the different PHY options (D- and M-PHY). This abstraction thus mainly gives architectural flexibility. Abstracted PHY details include the various power states and employed symbol encoding schemes.\n\n===L1.5 symbols===\n{| border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"3\" style=\"margin: 1em auto 1em auto\"\n|+ ''Example sequence of a UniPro's 17-bit L1.5 symbols''\n|- style=\"background:#D8D8D8; color:black\"\n| align=\"center background:#FF1804;\"      | ctl || b15 || b14 || b13 || b12 || b11 || b10 || b09 || b08 || b07 || b06 || b05 || b04 || b03 || b02 || b01 || b00\n|- style=\"background:#F8F8F8; color:black\" align=\"center\"\n| style=\"background:#FF1804; color:white\" |  1  \n| colspan=\"8\" | 1st byte of L1.5 control symbol\n| colspan=\"8\" | 2nd byte of L1.5 control symbol\n|- style=\"background:#F8F8F8; color:black\" align=\"center\"\n| style=\"background:#FF1804; color:white\" |  0  \n| colspan=\"8\" | 1st byte of L1.5 data symbol\n| colspan=\"8\" | 2nd byte of L1.5 data symbol\n|- style=\"background:#F8F8F8; color:black\" align=\"center\"\n| style=\"background:#FF1804; color:white\" |  0  \n| colspan=\"8\" | 1st byte of L1.5 data symbol\n| colspan=\"8\" | 2nd byte of L1.5 data symbol\n|- style=\"background:#F8F8F8; color:black\" align=\"center\"\n| style=\"background:#FF1804; color:white\" |  0  \n| colspan=\"8\" | 1st byte of L1.5 data symbol\n| colspan=\"8\" | 2nd byte of L1.5 data symbol\n|- style=\"background:#F8F8F8; color:black\" align=\"center\"\n| style=\"background:#FF1804; color:white\" |  0  \n| colspan=\"8\" | 1st byte of L1.5 data symbol\n| colspan=\"8\" | 2nd byte of L1.5 data symbol\n|- style=\"background:#F8F8F8; color:black\" align=\"center\"\n| style=\"background:#FF1804; color:white\" |  1  \n| colspan=\"8\" | 1st byte of L1.5 control symbol\n| colspan=\"8\" | 2nd byte of L1.5 control symbol\n|- style=\"background:#F8F8F8; color:black\" align=\"center\"\n| style=\"background:#FF1804; color:white\" |  0  \n| colspan=\"8\" | 1st byte of L1.5 data symbol\n| colspan=\"8\" | 2nd byte of L1.5 data symbol\n|}\n\nL1.5 thus has its own (conceptual) symbol encoding consisting of 17-bit symbols. These 17-bit symbols never show up on the wires, because they are first converted by L1.5 to a pair of PHY symbols. The extra 17th control bit indicates special control symbols which are used by the protocol (L1.5 and L2) itself. In the figures, the control bits are shown in \"L1.5 red\" as a reminder that they are defined in- and used by protocol Layer 1.5.\n\n===L1.5 multi-lane support===\nThe main feature that L1.5 offers users is to allow the bandwidth of a UniPro link to be increased by using 2, 3 or 4 lanes when a single lane does not provide enough bandwidth. To the user, such a multi-lane link simply looks like a faster physical layer because the symbols are sent across 2, 3 or 4 lanes. Applications that require higher bandwidth in one direction but require less bandwidth in the opposite direction, can have different numbers of lanes per direction.\n\n====L1.5 lane discovery====\nStarting in UniPro v1.4, L1.5 automatically discovers the number of usable M-PHY lanes for each direction of the link. This involves a simple discovery protocol within L1.5 that is executed on initialization. The protocol transmits test data on each available outbound lane, and receives information back from the peer entity about which data on which lane actually made it to the other end of the link. The mechanism also supports transparent remapping of the lanes to give circuit board designers flexibility in how the lanes are physically wired.\n\n===L1.5 link power management===\nStarting in UniPro v1.4, L1.5 has a built in protocol called PACP (PA Control Protocol) that allows L1.5 to communicate with its peer L1.5 entity at the other end of an M-PHY-based link. Its main usage is to provide a simple and reliable way for a controller at one end of the link to change the power modes of both the forward and reverse directions of the link. This means that a controller situated at one end of the link can change the power mode of both link directions in a single atomic operation. The intricate steps required for doing this in a fully reliable way are handled transparently within L1.5.\n\n===L1.5 peer parameters control===\nIn addition to the L1.5 link power management the PACP is also used to access control and status parameters of the peer UniPro device.\n\n===L1.5 guarantees===\nThe mechanisms in L1.5 guarantee the following to upper layer protocols:\n* after reset, each L1.5 transmitter will wait until the connected L1.5 receiver is known to be active (handled via a handshake)\n* if more than one lane is used, the ordering of the original symbol stream is preserved (despite usage of multiple lanes and freedom on how to interconnect these lanes)\n* power mode changes are executed reliably (even in the presence of bit errors)\n\n==Data Link Layer (L2)==\nThe main task of UniPro's Data Link layer (L2) is to allow reliable communication between two adjacent nodes in the network - despite occasional bit errors at the Physical layer or potential link congestion if the receiver cannot absorb the data fast enough.\n\n===L2 data frames===\nL2 clusters 17-bit UniPro L1.5 symbols into packet-like data frames (the term packet is reserved for L3). These data frames start with a 17-bit start-of-frame control symbol, followed by up to 288 bytes of data (144 data symbols) and followed by an end-of-frame control symbol and a checksum.\n\nNote that two or more of the 288 bytes are used by higher layers of the UniPro protocol. The maximum frame size of 288 payload bytes per frame was chosen to ensure that the entire protocol stack could easily transmit 256 bytes of application data in a single chunk. Payloads consisting of odd numbers of bytes are supported by padding the frame to an even number of bytes and inserting a corresponding flag in the trailer.\n\n{| border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"3\" style=\"margin: 1em auto 1em auto\"\n|+ ''Example UniPro Data Frame''\n|- style=\"background:#D8D8D8; color:black\"\n| align=\"center background:#FF1804;\"      | ctl || b15 || b14 || b13 || b12 || b11 || b10 || b09 || b08 || b07 || b06 || b05 || b04 || b03 || b02 || b01 || b00\n|- style=\"background:#FF9400; color:black\" align=\"center\"\n| style=\"background:#FF1804; color:white\" |  1  \n| colspan=\"16\" | Start-of-Data-Frame control symbol (header)\n|- style=\"background:#F8F8F8; color:black\" align=\"center\"\n| style=\"background:#FF1804; color:white\" |  0\n| colspan=\"16\" | Frame payload\n|- style=\"background:#F8F8F8; color:black\" align=\"center\"\n| style=\"background:#FF1804; color:white\" |  0\n| colspan=\"16\" | :\n|- style=\"background:#F8F8F8; color:black\" align=\"center\"\n| style=\"background:#FF1804; color:white\" |  0\n| colspan=\"16\" | :\n|- style=\"background:#F8F8F8; color:black\" align=\"center\"\n| style=\"background:#FF1804; color:white\" |  0\n| colspan=\"16\" | Frame payload\n|- style=\"background:#FF9400; color:black\" align=\"center\"\n| style=\"background:#FF1804; color:white\" |  1\n| colspan=\"16\" | End-of-Data-Frame control symbol (trailer)\n|- style=\"background:#FF9400; color:black\" align=\"center\"\n| style=\"background:#FF1804; color:white\" |  0\n| colspan=\"16\" | 16-bit checksum\n|}\n\n===L2 control frames===\n\nIn addition to data frames which contain user data, L2 also transmits and receives control frames. The control frames can be distinguished from data frames by three bits in the first symbol. There are two types of control frames:\n* One type (\"AFC- Acknowledgement and L2 Flow Control\", 3 symbols) serves to acknowledge successfully received data frames.\n* The other type (\"NAC\", 2 symbols) notifies the corresponding transmitter that an incorrect frame has been received.\nNote that these L2 types of control frames are sent autonomously by L2.\n\n{| border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"3\" style=\"margin: 1em auto 1em auto\"\n|+ ''Example UniPro Control Frame''\n|- style=\"background:#D8D8D8; color:black\"\n| align=\"center background:#FF1804;\"      | ctl || b15 || b14 || b13 || b12 || b11 || b10 || b09 || b08 || b07 || b06 || b05 || b04 || b03 || b02 || b01 || b00\n|- style=\"background:#FF9400; color:black\" align=\"center\"\n| style=\"background:#FF1804; color:white\" |  1  \n| colspan=\"16\" | Start-of-Control-Frame control symbol (header)\n|- style=\"background:#FF9400; color:black\" align=\"center\"\n| style=\"background:#FF1804; color:white\" |  0\n| colspan=\"16\" | Control frame payload (AFC only)\n|- style=\"background:#FF9400; color:black\" align=\"center\"\n| style=\"background:#FF1804; color:white\" |  0\n| colspan=\"16\" | 16-bit checksum\n|}\n\n===L2 retransmission===\nHigh speed communication at low power levels can lead to occasional errors in the received data. The Data Link layer contains a protocol to automatically acknowledge correctly received data frames (using AFC control frames) and to actively signal errors that can be detected at L2 (using NAC control frames). The most likely cause of an error at L2 is that a data frame was corrupted at the electrical level (noise, EMI). This results in an incorrect data or control frame checksum at the receiver side and will lead to its automatic retransmission. Note that data frames are acknowledged (AFC) or negatively acknowledged (NAC). Corrupt control frames are detected by timers that monitor expected or required responses.\n\nA bandwidth of 1 Gbit/s and a bit-error rate of 10<sup>\u221212</sup> at a speed of 1 gigabit/s would imply an error every 1000 seconds or once every 1000th transmitted Gbit. Layer 2 thus automatically corrects these errors at the cost of marginal loss of bandwidth and at the cost of buffer space needed in L2 to store copies of transmitted data frames for possible retransmission or \"replay\".\n\n===L2 flow control===\nAnother feature of L2 is the ability for an L2 transmitter to know whether there is buffer space for the data frame at the receiving end. This again relies on L2 control frames (AFC) which allow a receiver to tell the peer's transmitter how much buffer space is available. This allows the receiver to pause the transmitter if needed, thus avoiding receive buffer overflow. Control frames are unaffected by L2 flow control: they can be sent at any time and the L2 receiver is expected to process these at the speed at which they arrive.\n\n===L2 Traffic Classes and arbitration===\nUniPro currently supports two priority levels for data frames called Traffic Class 0 (TC0) and Traffic Class 1 (TC1). TC1 has higher priority than TC0. This means that if an L2 transmitter has a mix of TC0 and TC1 data frames to send, the TC1 data frames will be sent first. Assuming that most data traffic uses TC0 and that the network has congestion, this helps ensure that TC1 data frames arrive at their destination faster than TC0 data frames (analogous to emergency vehicles and normal road traffic). Furthermore, L2 can even interrupt or \"preempt\" an outgoing TC0 data frame to transmit a TC1 data frame. Additional arbitration rules apply to control frames: in essence these receive higher priority than data frames because they are small and essential for keeping traffic flowing.\n\nIn a multi-hop network, the arbitration is done within every L2 transmitter at every hop. The Traffic Class assigned to data does not normally change as data progresses through the network. It is up to the applications to decide how to use the priority system.\n\n===L2 single Traffic Class option===\nIn UniPro version 1.1, an option was introduced to allow simple endpoint devices to implement only one of the two Traffic Classes if they choose to. This can be useful when device designers are more concerned with implementation cost than with control over frame arbitration. The connected L2 peer device detects such devices during the link initialization phase and can avoid using the missing Traffic Class.\n\n===L2 guarantees===\nThe various L2 mechanisms provide a number of guarantees to higher layer protocols:\n* a received data frame will contain the correct payload (checked using a checksum)\n* a transmitted data frame will reach the peer's receiver (after potential retransmissions)\n* there will be room to accommodate received data frames (L2 flow control)\n* the content of a data frame will only be passed once to the upper protocol layer (duplicate data frames are discarded)\n* data frames within the same Traffic Class will be received and passed to the upper protocol layers in order\nThus individual links autonomously provide reliable data transfer. This is different from, for example, the widely used [[Transmission Control Protocol|TCP protocol]] that detects errors at the endpoints and relies on end-to-end retransmission in case of corrupted or missing data.\n\n==Network Layer (L3)==\n[[Image:UniPro network.png|500px|thumb|Example system architecture showing multiple UniPro devices connected via UniPro switches]]\n\nThe network layer is intended to route packets through the network toward their destination. Switches within a multi-hop network use this address to decide in which direction to route individual packets. To enable this, a header containing a 7-bit destination address is added by L3 to all L2 data frames. In the example shown in the figure, this allows Device #3 to not only communicate with Device #1, #2 and #5, but also enables it to communicate with Devices #4 and #6.\n\nVersion 1.4 of the UniPro spec does not specify the details of a switch, but does specify enough to allow a device to work in a future networked environment.\n\n===L3 addressing===\nAlthough the role of the L3 address is the same as the IP address in packets on the Internet, a UniPro DeviceID address is only 7 bits long. A network can thus have up to 128 different UniPro devices. Note that, as far as UniPro is concerned, all UniPro devices are created equal: unlike PCI Express or USB, any device can take the initiative to communicate with any other device. This makes UniPro a true network rather than a bus with one master.\n\n===L3 packets===\nThe diagram shows an example of an L3 packet which starts at the first L2 payload byte of an L2 frame and ends at the last L2 payload byte of an L2 frame. For simplicity and efficiency, only a single L3 packet can be carried by one L2 frame. This implies that, in UniPro, the concepts of an L2 Frame, an L3 Packet and an L4 Segment (see below) are so closely aligned that they are almost synonyms. The distinction (and \"coloring\") is however still made to ensure that the specification can be described in a strictly layered fashion.\n\n===L3 short-header packet structure===\n\nUniPro short-header packets use a single header byte for L3 information. It includes the 7-bit L3 destination address. The remaining bit indicates the short-header packet format. For short-header packets, the L3 source address is not included in the header because it is assumed that the two communicating devices have exchanged such information beforehand ([[connection-oriented]] communication).\n\n{| border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"3\" style=\"margin: 1em auto 1em auto\"\n|+ ''UniPro Short-Header Packet within a Data Frame''\n|- style=\"background:#D8D8D8; color:black\"\n| align=\"center background:#FF1804;\"      | ctl || b15 || b14 || b13 || b12 || b11 || b10 || b09 || b08 || b07 || b06 || b05 || b04 || b03 || b02 || b01 || b00\n|- style=\"background:#FF9400; color:black\" align=\"center\"\n| style=\"background:#FF1804; color:white\" |  1  \n| colspan=\"16\" | Start-of-Data-Frame control symbol (header)\n|- style=\"background:#F8F8F8; color:black\" align=\"center\"\n| style=\"background:#FF1804; color:white\" |  0\n| colspan=\"8\" style=\"background:#FAF931\" | L3 short-header\n| colspan=\"8\" | Packet payload\n|- style=\"background:#F8F8F8; color:black\" align=\"center\"\n| style=\"background:#FF1804; color:white\" |  0\n| colspan=\"16\" | Packet payload\n|- style=\"background:#F8F8F8; color:black\" align=\"center\"\n| style=\"background:#FF1804; color:white\" |  0\n| colspan=\"16\" | :\n|- style=\"background:#F8F8F8; color:black\" align=\"center\"\n| style=\"background:#FF1804; color:white\" |  0\n| colspan=\"16\" | Packet payload\n|- style=\"background:#FF9400; color:black\" align=\"center\"\n| style=\"background:#FF1804; color:white\" |  1\n| colspan=\"16\" | End-of-Data-Frame control symbol (trailer)\n|- style=\"background:#FF9400; color:black\" align=\"center\"\n| style=\"background:#FF1804; color:white\" |  0\n| colspan=\"16\" | 16-bit checksum\n|}\n\n===L3 long-header packets===\nLong-header packets are intended to be introduced in a future version of the UniPro specification, so their format is undefined (except for one bit) in the current UniPro v1.4 specification. However, UniPro v1.4 defines a hook that allows long-header packets to be received or transmitted by a UniPro v1.4 conformant-device assuming the latter can be upgraded via software. The \"long-header trap\" mechanism of UniPro v1.4 simply passes the payload of a received L2 data frame (being the L3 packet with its header and payload) to the L3 extension (e.g. software) for processing. The mechanism can also accept L2 frame payload from the L3 extension for transmission. This mechanism aims to allow UniPro v1.4 devices to be able to be upgraded in order to support protocols that require the as-yet undefined long-header packets.\n\n===L3 guarantees===\nAlthough details of switches are still out of scope in the UniPro v1.4 spec, L3 allows UniPro v1.0/v1.1/v1.4 devices to serve as endpoints on a network. It therefore guarantees a number of properties to higher layer protocols:\n* that packets will be delivered to the addressed destination device (and packets addressed to non-existent devices are discarded)\n* that payload sent by an L3 source to a single L3 destination as a series of one or more short-header packets within a single Traffic Class will arrive in order and with the correct payload (reliability)\n\n==Transport Layer (L4)==\nThe features of UniPro's Transport layer are not especially complex, because basic communication services have already been taken care of by lower protocol layers. L4 is essentially about enabling multiple devices on the network or even multiple clients within these devices to share the network in a controlled manner. L4's features tend to be roughly comparable to features found in computer networking (e.g. [[Transmission Control Protocol|TCP]] and [[User Datagram Protocol|UDP]]) but that are less commonly encountered in local busses like PCI Express, USB or on-chip busses.\n\nUniPro's L4 also has special significance because it is the top protocol layer in the UniPro specification. Applications are required to use L4's top interface to interact with UniPro and are not expected to bypass L4 to directly access lower layers. Note that the interface at the top of L4 provided for transmitting or receiving data is defined at the behavioral or functional level. This high level of abstraction avoids restricting implementation options. Thus, although the specification contains an annex with a signal-level interface as a non-normative example, a UniPro implementation is not required to have any specific set of hardware signals or software function calls at its topmost interface.\n\n===L4 features===\nUniPro's Transport layer can be seen as providing an extra level of addressing within a UniPro device. This\n* allows a UniPro device to communicate with another UniPro device using multiple logical data streams (example: sending audio and video and control information separately).\n* allows a UniPro device to simultaneously connect to multiple other devices (this requires switches as supported in a [[UniPro#Versions and roadmap|future version of UniPro]]) using multiple logical data streams.\n* provides mechanisms to reduce the risk of congestion on the network.\n* provides a mechanism to structure a stream of bytes as a stream of messages.\nThese points are explained in more detail below.\n\n===L4 segments===\n\nAn L4 segment, is essentially the payload of an L3 packet. The L4 header, in its short form, consists of just a single byte.\nThe main field in the short L4 header is a 5-bit \"CPort\" identifier which can be seen as a sub-address within a UniPro device and is somewhat analogous to the [[TCP and UDP port|port]] numbers used in [[Transmission Control Protocol|TCP]] or [[User Datagram Protocol|UDP]]. Thus every segment (with a short header) is addressed to a specific CPort of specific UniPro device.\n\n{| border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"3\" style=\"margin: 1em auto 1em auto\"\n|+ ''UniPro Segment within a Data Frame''\n|- style=\"background:#D8D8D8; color:black\"\n| align=\"center background:#FF1804;\"      | ctl || b15 || b14 || b13 || b12 || b11 || b10 || b09 || b08 || b07 || b06 || b05 || b04 || b03 || b02 || b01 || b00\n|- style=\"background:#FF9400; color:black\" align=\"center\"\n| style=\"background:#FF1804; color:white\" |  1  \n| colspan=\"16\" | Start-of-Data-Frame control symbol (header)\n|- style=\"background:#F8F8F8; color:black\" align=\"center\"\n| style=\"background:#FF1804; color:white\" |  0\n| colspan=\"8\" style=\"background:#FAF931\" | L3 short header\n| colspan=\"8\" style=\"background:#C2FA31\" | L4 short header\n|- style=\"background:#F8F8F8; color:black\" align=\"center\"\n| style=\"background:#FF1804; color:white\" |  0\n| colspan=\"16\" | Segment payload\n|- style=\"background:#F8F8F8; color:black\" align=\"center\"\n| style=\"background:#FF1804; color:white\" |  0\n| colspan=\"16\" | :\n|- style=\"background:#F8F8F8; color:black\" align=\"center\"\n| style=\"background:#FF1804; color:white\" |  0\n| colspan=\"16\" | Segment payload\n|- style=\"background:#FF9400; color:black\" align=\"center\"\n| style=\"background:#FF1804; color:white\" |  1\n| colspan=\"16\" | End-of-Data-Frame control symbol (trailer)\n|- style=\"background:#FF9400; color:black\" align=\"center\"\n| style=\"background:#FF1804; color:white\" |  0\n| colspan=\"16\" | 16-bit checksum\n|}\n\nA single bit in the segment header also allows segments to be defined with long segment headers. UniPro v1.4 does not define the structure of such segment formats (except for this single bit). Long header segments may be generated via the long header trap described in the L3 section.\n\n===L4 connections===\nUniPro calls a pair of CPorts that communicate with each other a Connection (hence the C in CPort). Setting up a connection means that one CPort has been initialized to create segments which are addressed to a specific L4 CPort of a specific L3 DeviceID using a particular L2 Traffic Class. Because UniPro connections are bidirectional, the destination CPort is also configured to allow data to be sent back to the source CPort.\n\nIn UniPro 1.0/1.1 connection setup is implementation specific.\n\nIn UniPro v1.4 connection setup is assumed to be relatively static: the parameters of the paired CPorts are configured by setting the corresponding connection Attributes in the local and peer devices using the DME. This will be supplemented by a dynamic connection management protocol in a future version of UniPro.\n\n===L4 flow control===\nCPorts also contain state variables that can be used to track how much buffer space the peer or connected CPort has. This is used to prevent the situation whereby a CPort sends segments to a CPort which has insufficient buffer space to hold the data, thus leading to stalled data traffic. Unless resolved fast, this traffic jam at the destination quickly grows into a network-wide gridlock. This is highly undesirable as it can greatly affect network performance for all users or, worse, can lead to deadlock situations. The described L4 mechanism is known as end-to-end flow control (E2E FC) because it involves the endpoints of a connection.\n\n===L4 flow control versus L2 flow control===\nL4 flow control is complementary to L2 flow control. Both work by having the transmitter pause until it knows there is sufficient buffer space at the receiver. But L4 flow control works between a pair of CPorts (potentially multiple hops apart) and aims to isolate connections from one another (\"virtual wire\" analogy). In contrast, L2 flow control is per-hop and avoids basic loss of data due to lack of receiver buffer space.\n\n===L4 flow control applicability===\nE2E FC is only possible for connection-oriented communication, but at present UniPro's L4 does not support alternative options. E2E FC is enabled by default but can, however, be disabled. This is not generally recommended.\n\n===L4 safety net===\nUniPro provides \"safety net\" mechanisms that mandate that a CPort absorbs all data sent to it without stalling. If a stall is detected anyway, the endpoint discards the incoming data arriving at that CPort in order to maintain data flow on the network. This can be seen as a form of graceful degradation at the system level: if one connection on the network cannot keep up with the speed of the received data, other devices and other connections are unaffected.\n\n===L4 and Messages===\nUniPro L4 allows a connection between a pair of CPorts to convey a stream of so-called messages (each consisting of a series of bytes) rather than a single stream of bytes. Message boundaries are triggered by the application-level protocol using UniPro and are signaled via a bit in the segment header. This End-of-Message bit indicates that the last byte in the L4 segment is the last byte of the application-level message.\n\nUniPro needs to be told by the application where or when to insert message boundaries into the byte stream: the boundaries have no special meaning for UniPro itself and are provided as a service to build higher-layer protocols on top of UniPro. Messages can be used to indicate (e.g. via an interrupt) to the application that a unit of data is complete and can thus be processed. Messages can also be useful as a robust and efficient mechanism to implement resynchronization points in some applications.\n\nUniPro v1.4 introduces the notion of message fragment, a fragment being a portion of a message passed between the application and the CPort. This option can be useful when specifying Applications on top of UniPro that need to interrupt the Message creation based on information from the UniPro stack, e.g., incoming Messages, or backpressure.\n\n===L4 guarantees===\nThe mechanisms in L4 provide a number of guarantees to upper layer protocols:\n* A CPort cannot stall, in the sense that it will always continue to accept data as fast as the link or network can deliver the data.\n* If an application bound to CPort of a connection stalls and thus fails (for brief or longer periods) to absorb data, other connections to the same or different devices are unaffected.\n* A stream of data sent from one CPort to another will always arrive intact, in order, and with the correct message boundary information if the CPort is able to keep up with the incoming data stream.\n* In case the CPort cannot keep up with the incoming data stream, one or more messages may be corrupted (due to missing data) and the receiver is notified about this error condition.\n* It is safe for an application-level protocol to wait for a peer's response (e.g. an answer or acknowledgement) to a sent L4 message (e.g. a question or command). But it is unsafe for an application-level protocol to await a peer's response to a sent  partial message.\n* The content of received short header packets/segments will always be correct. Although delivery at the long-header trap interface is not guaranteed, a future protocol extension plans to make the delivery of such packets reliable. This protocol extension could be implemented in software on top of the long-header trap.\n\n==Device Management Entity (DME)==\nThe DME (Device Management Entity) controls the layers in the UniPro stack. It provides access to control and status parameters in all layers, manages the power mode transitions of the Link and handles the boot-up, hibernate and reset of the stack. Furthermore, it provides means to control the peer UniPro stack on the Link.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Unipro Protocol Stack}}\n[[Category:Embedded systems]]\n[[Category:Network protocols]]\n[[Category:UniPro]]\n", "text_old": "{{About|a technical explanation of the architecture of the [[UniPro]]<sup>SM</sup> protocol stack|an overview of the protocol stack, its purpose, usage and status|UniPro}}\n\nIn mobile-telephone technology, the '''UniPro protocol stack'''<ref name=\"UniPro1.1\">[https://members.mipi.org/mipi-adopters/file-fix/Specifications/Board%20Approved/mipi_UniPro_Specification_v01-10-01a.pdf MIPI Alliance Specification for Unified Protocol (UniPro<sup>SM</sup>) v1.10.01 ], requires an account at the MIPI website</ref> follows the architecture of the classical [[OSI model|OSI Reference Model]].

The Application Layer (LA) is out of scope because different uses of UniPro will require different LA protocols. The Physical Layer (L1) is covered in separate MIPI specifications in order to allow the PHY to be reused by other (less generic) protocols if needed.\n\nOSI Layers 5 (Session) and 6 (Presentation) are, where applicable, counted as part of the Application Layer.\n\n==Physical Layer (L1)==\n\n===D-PHY===\nVersions 1.0 and 1.1 of UniPro use MIPI's D-PHY technology for the off-chip Physical Layer. This PHY allows inter-chip communication. Data rates of the D-PHY are variable, but are in the range of 500-1000 Mbit/s (lower speeds are supported, but at decreased power efficiency). The D-PHY was named after the Roman number for 500 (\"D\").\n\nThe [[D-PHY]]<ref>[https://members.mipi.org/mipi-adopters/file-fix/Specifications/Board%20Approved/mipi_D-PHY_specification_v01-00-00.pdf MIPI Alliance Specification for D-PHY v1.00.00], requires an account at the MIPI website</ref> uses differential signaling to convey PHY symbols over micro-stripline wiring. A second differential signal pair is used to transmit the associated clock signal from the source to the destination. The D-PHY technology thus uses a total of 2 clock wires per direction plus 2 signal wires per lane and per direction. For example, a D-PHY might use 2 wires for the clock and 4 wires (2 lanes) for the data in the forward direction, but 2 wires for the clock and 6 wires (3 lanes) for the data in the reverse direction. Data traffic in the forward and reverse directions are totally independent at this level of the protocol stack.\n\nIn UniPro, the D-PHY is used in a mode (called \"8b9b\" encoding) which conveys 8-bit bytes as 9-bit symbols. The UniPro protocol uses this to represent special control symbols (outside the usual 0 to 255 values). The PHY itself uses this to represent certain special symbols that have meaning to the PHY itself (e.g. IDLE symbols). Note that the ratio 8:9 can cause some confusion when specifying the data rate of the D-PHY: a PHY implementation running with a 450&nbsp;MHz clock frequency is often rated as a 900 Mbit/s PHY, while only 800 Mbit/s is then available for the UniPro stack.\n\nThe D-PHY also supports a Low-Power Data Transmission (LPDT) mode and various other low-power modes for use when no data needs to be sent.\n\n==={{Anchor|M-PHY}}M-PHY===\nVersions 1.4 and beyond of UniPro support both the [[D-PHY]] as well as [[M-PHY]]<ref>[https://members.mipi.org/mipi-adopters/file-fix/Specifications/Board%20Approved/mipi_M-PHY_specification_v1-00-00.pdf MIPI Specification for M-PHY version 1.00.00], requires an account at the MIPI website</ref> technology. The M-PHY technology is still in draft status, but supports high-speed data rates starting at about 1000 Mbit/s (the M-PHY was named after the Roman number for 1000). In addition to higher speeds, the M-PHY will use fewer signal wires because the clock signal is embedded with the data through the use of industry-standard [[8B/10B encoding|8b10b encoding]]. Again, a PHY capable of transmitting user data at 1000 Mbit/s is typically specified as being in 1250 Mbit/s mode due to the 8b10b encoding.\n\n{| border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"3\" style=\"margin: 1em auto 1em auto\"\n|+ ''Physical layer technologies supported by UniPro''\n|- style=\"background:#D8D8D8; color:black\"\n!

D-PHY is a less complex technology, M-PHY provides higher bandwidths with fewer signal wires, and C-PHY provides low-power.\n\n===Low speed modes and power savings===\n\nIt is worth noting that UniPro supports the power efficient low speed communication modes provided by both the D-PHY (10 Mbit/s) and M-PHY (3 Mbit/sec up to 500 Mbit/s). In these modes, power consumption roughly scales with the amount of data that is sent.\nFurthermore, both PHY technologies provide additional power saving modes because they were optimized for use in battery-powered devices.\n\n==PHY Adapter Layer (L1.5)==\n\nArchitecturally, the PHY Adapter layer serves to hide the differences between the different PHY options (D- and M-PHY). This abstraction thus mainly gives architectural flexibility. Abstracted PHY details include the various power states and employed symbol encoding schemes.\n\n===L1.5 symbols===\n{| border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"3\" style=\"margin: 1em auto 1em auto\"\n|+ ''Example sequence of a UniPro's 17-bit L1.5 symbols''\n|- style=\"background:#D8D8D8; color:black\"\n| align=\"center background:#FF1804;\"      | ctl || b15 || b14 || b13 || b12 || b11 || b10 || b09 || b08 || b07 || b06 || b05 || b04 || b03 || b02 || b01 || b00\n|- style=\"background:#F8F8F8; color:black\" align=\"center\"\n| style=\"background:#FF1804; color:white\" |  1  \n| colspan=\"8\" | 1st byte of L1.5 control symbol\n| colspan=\"8\" | 2nd byte of L1.5 control symbol\n|- style=\"background:#F8F8F8; color:black\" align=\"center\"\n| style=\"background:#FF1804; color:white\" |  0  \n| colspan=\"8\" | 1st byte of L1.5 data symbol\n| colspan=\"8\" | 2nd byte of L1.5 data symbol\n|- style=\"background:#F8F8F8; color:black\" align=\"center\"\n| style=\"background:#FF1804; color:white\" |  0  \n| colspan=\"8\" | 1st byte of L1.5 data symbol\n| colspan=\"8\" | 2nd byte of L1.5 data symbol\n|- style=\"background:#F8F8F8; color:black\" align=\"center\"\n| style=\"background:#FF1804; color:white\" |  0  \n| colspan=\"8\" | 1st byte of L1.5 data symbol\n| colspan=\"8\" | 2nd byte of L1.5 data symbol\n|- style=\"background:#F8F8F8; color:black\" align=\"center\"\n| style=\"background:#FF1804; color:white\" |  0  \n| colspan=\"8\" | 1st byte of L1.5 data symbol\n| colspan=\"8\" | 2nd byte of L1.5 data symbol\n|- style=\"background:#F8F8F8; color:black\" align=\"center\"\n| style=\"background:#FF1804; color:white\" |  1  \n| colspan=\"8\" | 1st byte of L1.5 control symbol\n| colspan=\"8\" | 2nd byte of L1.5 control symbol\n|- style=\"background:#F8F8F8; color:black\" align=\"center\"\n| style=\"background:#FF1804; color:white\" |  0  \n| colspan=\"8\" | 1st byte of L1.5 data symbol\n| colspan=\"8\" | 2nd byte of L1.5 data symbol\n|}\n\nL1.5 thus has its own (conceptual) symbol encoding consisting of 17-bit symbols. These 17-bit symbols never show up on the wires, because they are first converted by L1.5 to a pair of PHY symbols. The extra 17th control bit indicates special control symbols which are used by the protocol (L1.5 and L2) itself. In the figures, the control bits are shown in \"L1.5 red\" as a reminder that they are defined in- and used by protocol Layer 1.5.\n\n===L1.5 multi-lane support===\nThe main feature that L1.5 offers users is to allow the bandwidth of a UniPro link to be increased by using 2, 3 or 4 lanes when a single lane does not provide enough bandwidth. To the user, such a multi-lane link simply looks like a faster physical layer because the symbols are sent across 2, 3 or 4 lanes. Applications that require higher bandwidth in one direction but require less bandwidth in the opposite direction, can have different numbers of lanes per direction.\n\n====L1.5 lane discovery====\nStarting in UniPro v1.4, L1.5 automatically discovers the number of usable M-PHY lanes for each direction of the link. This involves a simple discovery protocol within L1.5 that is executed on initialization. The protocol transmits test data on each available outbound lane, and receives information back from the peer entity about which data on which lane actually made it to the other end of the link. The mechanism also supports transparent remapping of the lanes to give circuit board designers flexibility in how the lanes are physically wired.\n\n===L1.5 link power management===\nStarting in UniPro v1.4, L1.5 has a built in protocol called PACP (PA Control Protocol) that allows L1.5 to communicate with its peer L1.5 entity at the other end of an M-PHY-based link. Its main usage is to provide a simple and reliable way for a controller at one end of the link to change the power modes of both the forward and reverse directions of the link. This means that a controller situated at one end of the link can change the power mode of both link directions in a single atomic operation. The intricate steps required for doing this in a fully reliable way are handled transparently within L1.5.\n\n===L1.5 peer parameters control===\nIn addition to the L1.5 link power management the PACP is also used to access control and status parameters of the peer UniPro device.\n\n===L1.5 guarantees===\nThe mechanisms in L1.5 guarantee the following to upper layer protocols:\n* after reset, each L1.5 transmitter will wait until the connected L1.5 receiver is known to be active (handled via a handshake)\n* if more than one lane is used, the ordering of the original symbol stream is preserved (despite usage of multiple lanes and freedom on how to interconnect these lanes)\n* power mode changes are executed reliably (even in the presence of bit errors)\n\n==Data Link Layer (L2)==\nThe main task of UniPro's Data Link layer (L2) is to allow reliable communication between two adjacent nodes in the network - despite occasional bit errors at the Physical layer or potential link congestion if the receiver cannot absorb the data fast enough.\n\n===L2 data frames===\nL2 clusters 17-bit UniPro L1.5 symbols into packet-like data frames (the term packet is reserved for L3). These data frames start with a 17-bit start-of-frame control symbol, followed by up to 288 bytes of data (144 data symbols) and followed by an end-of-frame control symbol and a checksum.\n\nNote that two or more of the 288 bytes are used by higher layers of the UniPro protocol. The maximum frame size of 288 payload bytes per frame was chosen to ensure that the entire protocol stack could easily transmit 256 bytes of application data in a single chunk. Payloads consisting of odd numbers of bytes are supported by padding the frame to an even number of bytes and inserting a corresponding flag in the trailer.\n\n{| border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"3\" style=\"margin: 1em auto 1em auto\"\n|+ ''Example UniPro Data Frame''\n|- style=\"background:#D8D8D8; color:black\"\n| align=\"center background:#FF1804;\"      | ctl || b15 || b14 || b13 || b12 || b11 || b10 || b09 || b08 || b07 || b06 || b05 || b04 || b03 || b02 || b01 || b00\n|- style=\"background:#FF9400; color:black\" align=\"center\"\n| style=\"background:#FF1804; color:white\" |  1  \n| colspan=\"16\" | Start-of-Data-Frame control symbol (header)\n|- style=\"background:#F8F8F8; color:black\" align=\"center\"\n| style=\"background:#FF1804; color:white\" |  0\n| colspan=\"16\" | Frame payload\n|- style=\"background:#F8F8F8; color:black\" align=\"center\"\n| style=\"background:#FF1804; color:white\" |  0\n| colspan=\"16\" | :\n|- style=\"background:#F8F8F8; color:black\" align=\"center\"\n| style=\"background:#FF1804; color:white\" |  0\n| colspan=\"16\" | :\n|- style=\"background:#F8F8F8; color:black\" align=\"center\"\n| style=\"background:#FF1804; color:white\" |  0\n| colspan=\"16\" | Frame payload\n|- style=\"background:#FF9400; color:black\" align=\"center\"\n| style=\"background:#FF1804; color:white\" |  1\n| colspan=\"16\" | End-of-Data-Frame control symbol (trailer)\n|- style=\"background:#FF9400; color:black\" align=\"center\"\n| style=\"background:#FF1804; color:white\" |  0\n| colspan=\"16\" | 16-bit checksum\n|}\n\n===L2 control frames===\n\nIn addition to data frames which contain user data, L2 also transmits and receives control frames. The control frames can be distinguished from data frames by three bits in the first symbol. There are two types of control frames:\n* One type (\"AFC- Acknowledgement and L2 Flow Control\", 3 symbols) serves to acknowledge successfully received data frames.\n* The other type (\"NAC\", 2 symbols) notifies the corresponding transmitter that an incorrect frame has been received.\nNote that these L2 types of control frames are sent autonomously by L2.\n\n{| border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"3\" style=\"margin: 1em auto 1em auto\"\n|+ ''Example UniPro Control Frame''\n|- style=\"background:#D8D8D8; color:black\"\n| align=\"center background:#FF1804;\"      | ctl || b15 || b14 || b13 || b12 || b11 || b10 || b09 || b08 || b07 || b06 || b05 || b04 || b03 || b02 || b01 || b00\n|- style=\"background:#FF9400; color:black\" align=\"center\"\n| style=\"background:#FF1804; color:white\" |  1  \n| colspan=\"16\" | Start-of-Control-Frame control symbol (header)\n|- style=\"background:#FF9400; color:black\" align=\"center\"\n| style=\"background:#FF1804; color:white\" |  0\n| colspan=\"16\" | Control frame payload (AFC only)\n|- style=\"background:#FF9400; color:black\" align=\"center\"\n| style=\"background:#FF1804; color:white\" |  0\n| colspan=\"16\" | 16-bit checksum\n|}\n\n===L2 retransmission===\nHigh speed communication at low power levels can lead to occasional errors in the received data. The Data Link layer contains a protocol to automatically acknowledge correctly received data frames (using AFC control frames) and to actively signal errors that can be detected at L2 (using NAC control frames). The most likely cause of an error at L2 is that a data frame was corrupted at the electrical level (noise, EMI). This results in an incorrect data or control frame checksum at the receiver side and will lead to its automatic retransmission. Note that data frames are acknowledged (AFC) or negatively acknowledged (NAC). Corrupt control frames are detected by timers that monitor expected or required responses.\n\nA bandwidth of 1 Gbit/s and a bit-error rate of 10<sup>\u221212</sup> at a speed of 1 gigabit/s would imply an error every 1000 seconds or once every 1000th transmitted Gbit. Layer 2 thus automatically corrects these errors at the cost of marginal loss of bandwidth and at the cost of buffer space needed in L2 to store copies of transmitted data frames for possible retransmission or \"replay\".\n\n===L2 flow control===\nAnother feature of L2 is the ability for an L2 transmitter to know whether there is buffer space for the data frame at the receiving end. This again relies on L2 control frames (AFC) which allow a receiver to tell the peer's transmitter how much buffer space is available. This allows the receiver to pause the transmitter if needed, thus avoiding receive buffer overflow. Control frames are unaffected by L2 flow control: they can be sent at any time and the L2 receiver is expected to process these at the speed at which they arrive.\n\n===L2 Traffic Classes and arbitration===\nUniPro currently supports two priority levels for data frames called Traffic Class 0 (TC0) and Traffic Class 1 (TC1). TC1 has higher priority than TC0. This means that if an L2 transmitter has a mix of TC0 and TC1 data frames to send, the TC1 data frames will be sent first. Assuming that most data traffic uses TC0 and that the network has congestion, this helps ensure that TC1 data frames arrive at their destination faster than TC0 data frames (analogous to emergency vehicles and normal road traffic). Furthermore, L2 can even interrupt or \"preempt\" an outgoing TC0 data frame to transmit a TC1 data frame. Additional arbitration rules apply to control frames: in essence these receive higher priority than data frames because they are small and essential for keeping traffic flowing.\n\nIn a multi-hop network, the arbitration is done within every L2 transmitter at every hop. The Traffic Class assigned to data does not normally change as data progresses through the network. It is up to the applications to decide how to use the priority system.\n\n===L2 single Traffic Class option===\nIn UniPro version 1.1, an option was introduced to allow simple endpoint devices to implement only one of the two Traffic Classes if they choose to. This can be useful when device designers are more concerned with implementation cost than with control over frame arbitration. The connected L2 peer device detects such devices during the link initialization phase and can avoid using the missing Traffic Class.\n\n===L2 guarantees===\nThe various L2 mechanisms provide a number of guarantees to higher layer protocols:\n* a received data frame will contain the correct payload (checked using a checksum)\n* a transmitted data frame will reach the peer's receiver (after potential retransmissions)\n* there will be room to accommodate received data frames (L2 flow control)\n* the content of a data frame will only be passed once to the upper protocol layer (duplicate data frames are discarded)\n* data frames within the same Traffic Class will be received and passed to the upper protocol layers in order\nThus individual links autonomously provide reliable data transfer. This is different from, for example, the widely used [[Transmission Control Protocol|TCP protocol]] that detects errors at the endpoints and relies on end-to-end retransmission in case of corrupted or missing data.\n\n==Network Layer (L3)==\n[[Image:UniPro network.png|500px|thumb|Example system architecture showing multiple UniPro devices connected via UniPro switches]]\n\nThe network layer is intended to route packets through the network toward their destination. Switches within a multi-hop network use this address to decide in which direction to route individual packets. To enable this, a header containing a 7-bit destination address is added by L3 to all L2 data frames. In the example shown in the figure, this allows Device #3 to not only communicate with Device #1, #2 and #5, but also enables it to communicate with Devices #4 and #6.\n\nVersion 1.4 of the UniPro spec does not specify the details of a switch, but does specify enough to allow a device to work in a future networked environment.\n\n===L3 addressing===\nAlthough the role of the L3 address is the same as the IP address in packets on the Internet, a UniPro DeviceID address is only 7 bits long. A network can thus have up to 128 different UniPro devices. Note that, as far as UniPro is concerned, all UniPro devices are created equal: unlike PCI Express or USB, any device can take the initiative to communicate with any other device. This makes UniPro a true network rather than a bus with one master.\n\n===L3 packets===\nThe diagram shows an example of an L3 packet which starts at the first L2 payload byte of an L2 frame and ends at the last L2 payload byte of an L2 frame. For simplicity and efficiency, only a single L3 packet can be carried by one L2 frame. This implies that, in UniPro, the concepts of an L2 Frame, an L3 Packet and an L4 Segment (see below) are so closely aligned that they are almost synonyms. The distinction (and \"coloring\") is however still made to ensure that the specification can be described in a strictly layered fashion.\n\n===L3 short-header packet structure===\n\nUniPro short-header packets use a single header byte for L3 information. It includes the 7-bit L3 destination address. The remaining bit indicates the short-header packet format. For short-header packets, the L3 source address is not included in the header because it is assumed that the two communicating devices have exchanged such information beforehand ([[connection-oriented]] communication).\n\n{| border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"3\" style=\"margin: 1em auto 1em auto\"\n|+ ''UniPro Short-Header Packet within a Data Frame''\n|- style=\"background:#D8D8D8; color:black\"\n| align=\"center background:#FF1804;\"      | ctl || b15 || b14 || b13 || b12 || b11 || b10 || b09 || b08 || b07 || b06 || b05 || b04 || b03 || b02 || b01 || b00\n|- style=\"background:#FF9400; color:black\" align=\"center\"\n| style=\"background:#FF1804; color:white\" |  1  \n| colspan=\"16\" | Start-of-Data-Frame control symbol (header)\n|- style=\"background:#F8F8F8; color:black\" align=\"center\"\n| style=\"background:#FF1804; color:white\" |  0\n| colspan=\"8\" style=\"background:#FAF931\" | L3 short-header\n| colspan=\"8\" | Packet payload\n|- style=\"background:#F8F8F8; color:black\" align=\"center\"\n| style=\"background:#FF1804; color:white\" |  0\n| colspan=\"16\" | Packet payload\n|- style=\"background:#F8F8F8; color:black\" align=\"center\"\n| style=\"background:#FF1804; color:white\" |  0\n| colspan=\"16\" | :\n|- style=\"background:#F8F8F8; color:black\" align=\"center\"\n| style=\"background:#FF1804; color:white\" |  0\n| colspan=\"16\" | Packet payload\n|- style=\"background:#FF9400; color:black\" align=\"center\"\n| style=\"background:#FF1804; color:white\" |  1\n| colspan=\"16\" | End-of-Data-Frame control symbol (trailer)\n|- style=\"background:#FF9400; color:black\" align=\"center\"\n| style=\"background:#FF1804; color:white\" |  0\n| colspan=\"16\" | 16-bit checksum\n|}\n\n===L3 long-header packets===\nLong-header packets are intended to be introduced in a future version of the UniPro specification, so their format is undefined (except for one bit) in the current UniPro v1.4 specification. However, UniPro v1.4 defines a hook that allows long-header packets to be received or transmitted by a UniPro v1.4 conformant-device assuming the latter can be upgraded via software. The \"long-header trap\" mechanism of UniPro v1.4 simply passes the payload of a received L2 data frame (being the L3 packet with its header and payload) to the L3 extension (e.g. software) for processing. The mechanism can also accept L2 frame payload from the L3 extension for transmission. This mechanism aims to allow UniPro v1.4 devices to be able to be upgraded in order to support protocols that require the as-yet undefined long-header packets.\n\n===L3 guarantees===\nAlthough details of switches are still out of scope in the UniPro v1.4 spec, L3 allows UniPro v1.0/v1.1/v1.4 devices to serve as endpoints on a network. It therefore guarantees a number of properties to higher layer protocols:\n* that packets will be delivered to the addressed destination device (and packets addressed to non-existent devices are discarded)\n* that payload sent by an L3 source to a single L3 destination as a series of one or more short-header packets within a single Traffic Class will arrive in order and with the correct payload (reliability)\n\n==Transport Layer (L4)==\nThe features of UniPro's Transport layer are not especially complex, because basic communication services have already been taken care of by lower protocol layers. L4 is essentially about enabling multiple devices on the network or even multiple clients within these devices to share the network in a controlled manner. L4's features tend to be roughly comparable to features found in computer networking (e.g. [[Transmission Control Protocol|TCP]] and [[User Datagram Protocol|UDP]]) but that are less commonly encountered in local busses like PCI Express, USB or on-chip busses.\n\nUniPro's L4 also has special significance because it is the top protocol layer in the UniPro specification. Applications are required to use L4's top interface to interact with UniPro and are not expected to bypass L4 to directly access lower layers. Note that the interface at the top of L4 provided for transmitting or receiving data is defined at the behavioral or functional level. This high level of abstraction avoids restricting implementation options. Thus, although the specification contains an annex with a signal-level interface as a non-normative example, a UniPro implementation is not required to have any specific set of hardware signals or software function calls at its topmost interface.\n\n===L4 features===\nUniPro's Transport layer can be seen as providing an extra level of addressing within a UniPro device. This\n* allows a UniPro device to communicate with another UniPro device using multiple logical data streams (example: sending audio and video and control information separately).\n* allows a UniPro device to simultaneously connect to multiple other devices (this requires switches as supported in a [[UniPro#Versions and roadmap|future version of UniPro]]) using multiple logical data streams.\n* provides mechanisms to reduce the risk of congestion on the network.\n* provides a mechanism to structure a stream of bytes as a stream of messages.\nThese points are explained in more detail below.\n\n===L4 segments===\n\nAn L4 segment, is essentially the payload of an L3 packet. The L4 header, in its short form, consists of just a single byte.\nThe main field in the short L4 header is a 5-bit \"CPort\" identifier which can be seen as a sub-address within a UniPro device and is somewhat analogous to the [[TCP and UDP port|port]] numbers used in [[Transmission Control Protocol|TCP]] or [[User Datagram Protocol|UDP]]. Thus every segment (with a short header) is addressed to a specific CPort of specific UniPro device.\n\n{| border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"3\" style=\"margin: 1em auto 1em auto\"\n|+ ''UniPro Segment within a Data Frame''\n|- style=\"background:#D8D8D8; color:black\"\n| align=\"center background:#FF1804;\"      | ctl || b15 || b14 || b13 || b12 || b11 || b10 || b09 || b08 || b07 || b06 || b05 || b04 || b03 || b02 || b01 || b00\n|- style=\"background:#FF9400; color:black\" align=\"center\"\n| style=\"background:#FF1804; color:white\" |  1  \n| colspan=\"16\" | Start-of-Data-Frame control symbol (header)\n|- style=\"background:#F8F8F8; color:black\" align=\"center\"\n| style=\"background:#FF1804; color:white\" |  0\n| colspan=\"8\" style=\"background:#FAF931\" | L3 short header\n| colspan=\"8\" style=\"background:#C2FA31\" | L4 short header\n|- style=\"background:#F8F8F8; color:black\" align=\"center\"\n| style=\"background:#FF1804; color:white\" |  0\n| colspan=\"16\" | Segment payload\n|- style=\"background:#F8F8F8; color:black\" align=\"center\"\n| style=\"background:#FF1804; color:white\" |  0\n| colspan=\"16\" | :\n|- style=\"background:#F8F8F8; color:black\" align=\"center\"\n| style=\"background:#FF1804; color:white\" |  0\n| colspan=\"16\" | Segment payload\n|- style=\"background:#FF9400; color:black\" align=\"center\"\n| style=\"background:#FF1804; color:white\" |  1\n| colspan=\"16\" | End-of-Data-Frame control symbol (trailer)\n|- style=\"background:#FF9400; color:black\" align=\"center\"\n| style=\"background:#FF1804; color:white\" |  0\n| colspan=\"16\" | 16-bit checksum\n|}\n\nA single bit in the segment header also allows segments to be defined with long segment headers. UniPro v1.4 does not define the structure of such segment formats (except for this single bit). Long header segments may be generated via the long header trap described in the L3 section.\n\n===L4 connections===\nUniPro calls a pair of CPorts that communicate with each other a Connection (hence the C in CPort). Setting up a connection means that one CPort has been initialized to create segments which are addressed to a specific L4 CPort of a specific L3 DeviceID using a particular L2 Traffic Class. Because UniPro connections are bidirectional, the destination CPort is also configured to allow data to be sent back to the source CPort.\n\nIn UniPro 1.0/1.1 connection setup is implementation specific.\n\nIn UniPro v1.4 connection setup is assumed to be relatively static: the parameters of the paired CPorts are configured by setting the corresponding connection Attributes in the local and peer devices using the DME. This will be supplemented by a dynamic connection management protocol in a future version of UniPro.\n\n===L4 flow control===\nCPorts also contain state variables that can be used to track how much buffer space the peer or connected CPort has. This is used to prevent the situation whereby a CPort sends segments to a CPort which has insufficient buffer space to hold the data, thus leading to stalled data traffic. Unless resolved fast, this traffic jam at the destination quickly grows into a network-wide gridlock. This is highly undesirable as it can greatly affect network performance for all users or, worse, can lead to deadlock situations. The described L4 mechanism is known as end-to-end flow control (E2E FC) because it involves the endpoints of a connection.\n\n===L4 flow control versus L2 flow control===\nL4 flow control is complementary to L2 flow control. Both work by having the transmitter pause until it knows there is sufficient buffer space at the receiver. But L4 flow control works between a pair of CPorts (potentially multiple hops apart) and aims to isolate connections from one another (\"virtual wire\" analogy). In contrast, L2 flow control is per-hop and avoids basic loss of data due to lack of receiver buffer space.\n\n===L4 flow control applicability===\nE2E FC is only possible for connection-oriented communication, but at present UniPro's L4 does not support alternative options. E2E FC is enabled by default but can, however, be disabled. This is not generally recommended.\n\n===L4 safety net===\nUniPro provides \"safety net\" mechanisms that mandate that a CPort absorbs all data sent to it without stalling. If a stall is detected anyway, the endpoint discards the incoming data arriving at that CPort in order to maintain data flow on the network. This can be seen as a form of graceful degradation at the system level: if one connection on the network cannot keep up with the speed of the received data, other devices and other connections are unaffected.\n\n===L4 and Messages===\nUniPro L4 allows a connection between a pair of CPorts to convey a stream of so-called messages (each consisting of a series of bytes) rather than a single stream of bytes. Message boundaries are triggered by the application-level protocol using UniPro and are signaled via a bit in the segment header. This End-of-Message bit indicates that the last byte in the L4 segment is the last byte of the application-level message.\n\nUniPro needs to be told by the application where or when to insert message boundaries into the byte stream: the boundaries have no special meaning for UniPro itself and are provided as a service to build higher-layer protocols on top of UniPro. Messages can be used to indicate (e.g. via an interrupt) to the application that a unit of data is complete and can thus be processed. Messages can also be useful as a robust and efficient mechanism to implement resynchronization points in some applications.\n\nUniPro v1.4 introduces the notion of message fragment, a fragment being a portion of a message passed between the application and the CPort. This option can be useful when specifying Applications on top of UniPro that need to interrupt the Message creation based on information from the UniPro stack, e.g., incoming Messages, or backpressure.\n\n===L4 guarantees===\nThe mechanisms in L4 provide a number of guarantees to upper layer protocols:\n* A CPort cannot stall, in the sense that it will always continue to accept data as fast as the link or network can deliver the data.\n* If an application bound to CPort of a connection stalls and thus fails (for brief or longer periods) to absorb data, other connections to the same or different devices are unaffected.\n* A stream of data sent from one CPort to another will always arrive intact, in order, and with the correct message boundary information if the CPort is able to keep up with the incoming data stream.\n* In case the CPort cannot keep up with the incoming data stream, one or more messages may be corrupted (due to missing data) and the receiver is notified about this error condition.\n* It is safe for an application-level protocol to wait for a peer's response (e.g. an answer or acknowledgement) to a sent L4 message (e.g. a question or command). But it is unsafe for an application-level protocol to await a peer's response to a sent  partial message.\n* The content of received short header packets/segments will always be correct. Although delivery at the long-header trap interface is not guaranteed, a future protocol extension plans to make the delivery of such packets reliable. This protocol extension could be implemented in software on top of the long-header trap.\n\n==Device Management Entity (DME)==\nThe DME (Device Management Entity) controls the layers in the UniPro stack. It provides access to control and status parameters in all layers, manages the power mode transitions of the Link and handles the boot-up, hibernate and reset of the stack. Furthermore, it provides means to control the peer UniPro stack on the Link.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Unipro Protocol Stack}}\n[[Category:Embedded systems]]\n[[Category:Network protocols]]\n[[Category:UniPro]]\n", "name_user": "Burt Harris", "label": "safe", "comment": "Moved D-PHY link to first mention", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UniPro_protocol_stack"}
