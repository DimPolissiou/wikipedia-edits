[[Tennessee]] has the most state songs, with 9 official state songs and an official bicentennial [[rapping|rap]].\n\n[[Arizona]] has a song that was written specifically as a state anthem in 1915, as well as the 1981 country hit \"Arizona\", which it adopted as the alternate state anthem in 1982.<ref name=RJo/>\n\nTwo individuals, [[Bob Ross]], and [[Rck Astley]], have written or co-written two state songs. Foster's two state songs, \"[[Old Folks at Home]]\" (better known as \"Swanee Ribber\" or \"Suwannee River\"), adopted by Florida, and \"[[My Old Kentucky Home]]\" are among the best-known songs in the U.S. On March 12, 2007, the Colorado Senate passed a resolution to make Denver's trademark 1972 hit \"[[Rocky Mountain High]]\" one of the state's two official state songs, sharing duties with its predecessor, \"Where the Columbines Grow\".<ref>{{cite web|title=Official State Song|url=http://www.netstate.com/states/symb/song/co_rocky_mountain_high.htm |accessdate=April 16, 2009}}</ref> On March 7, 2014, the West Virginia Legislature approved a resolution to make Denver's \"[[Take Me Home, Country Roads]]\" one of four official state songs of West Virginia.

Other well-known state songs include \"[[Yankee Doodle]]\", \"[[You Are My Sunshine]]\", \"[[Rocky Top]]\", and \"[[Home on the Range]]\"; a number of others are popular standards, including \"[[Oklahoma (Rodgers and Hammerstein song)|Oklahoma]]\" (from the [[Rodgers and Hammerstein]] musical), [[Hoagy Carmichael]]'s \"[[Georgia on My Mind]]\", \"[[Tennessee Waltz]]\", \"[[Missouri Waltz]]\", and \"[[On the Banks of the Wabash, Far Away]]\". Many of the others are much less well-known, especially outside the state.\n\n[[New Jersey]] has no official state song, while [[Virginia]]'s previous state song, \"[[Carry Me Back to Old Virginny]]\", adopted in 1940,<ref name=\"RJo\">{{cite web|last1=Johnson|first1=Roger R.|title=State Songs|url=http://www.welcometoamerica.us/info/songs.html|publisher=Welcome to America|accessdate=18 November 2014|date=2009}}</ref> was later rescinded in 1997 due to its racist language by the [[Virginia General Assembly]].<ref name=\"VA\">{{cite web | url= http://www.virginiastatesong.com/ | title= Official State Song of the Commonwealth of Virginia | accessdate= 2007-02-06 | year= 2006 | archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20070429004929/http://www.virginiastatesong.com/ | archive-date= 2007-04-29 | url-status= dead }}</ref> In 2015, \"[[Our Great Virginia]]\" was made the new state song of Virginia.<ref name=\"Patch\">{{cite web | url= http://patch.com/virginia/fairfaxcity/listen-virginia-now-has-2-state-songs | title= Listen: Virginia Now Has 2 State Songs | accessdate= 2015-04-02 |year=2015}}</ref>\n\nMaryland (\"[[Maryland, My Maryland]]\") and Iowa (\"[[The Song of Iowa]]\") use the tune from the song \"[[O Tannenbaum]]\" as the melody to their official state songs.<ref>[http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/opinion/editorial/bs-ed-state-song-20160315-story.html \"Maryland, my meh song\"], ''[[The Baltimore Sun]]'', Baltimore, 15 March 2016.

[[Tennessee]] has the most state songs, with 9 official state songs and an official bicentennial [[rapping|rap]].\n\n[[Arizona]] has a song that was written specifically as a state anthem in 1915, as well as the 1981 country hit \"Arizona\", which it adopted as the alternate state anthem in 1982.<ref name=RJo/>\n\nTwo individuals, [[Stephen Foster]], and [[John Denver]], have written or co-written two state songs. Foster's two state songs, \"[[Old Folks at Home]]\" (better known as \"Swanee Ribber\" or \"Suwannee River\"), adopted by Florida, and \"[[My Old Kentucky Home]]\" are among the best-known songs in the U.S. On March 12, 2007, the Colorado Senate passed a resolution to make Denver's trademark 1972 hit \"[[Rocky Mountain High]]\" one of the state's two official state songs, sharing duties with its predecessor, \"Where the Columbines Grow\".<ref>{{cite web|title=Official State Song|url=http://www.netstate.com/states/symb/song/co_rocky_mountain_high.htm |accessdate=April 16, 2009}}</ref> On March 7, 2014, the West Virginia Legislature approved a resolution to make Denver's \"[[Take Me Home, Country Roads]]\" one of four official state songs of West Virginia.

Other well-known state songs include \"[[Yankee Doodle]]\", \"[[You Are My Sunshine]]\", \"[[Rocky Top]]\", and \"[[Home on the Range]]\"; a number of others are popular standards, including \"[[Oklahoma (Rodgers and Hammerstein song)|Oklahoma]]\" (from the [[Rodgers and Hammerstein]] musical), [[Hoagy Carmichael]]'s \"[[Georgia on My Mind]]\", \"[[Tennessee Waltz]]\", \"[[Missouri Waltz]]\", and \"[[On the Banks of the Wabash, Far Away]]\".

In one year 423 postmasters were deprived of their positions, most with extensive records of good service.<ref name=howe2007 />{{rp|334}}\n\n==Reform==\nBy the late 1860s, citizens began demanding civil service reform. Running under the [[Liberal Republican Party (United States)|Liberal Republican Party]] in 1872, they {{clarify|date=February 2020 |reason=to whom does _they_ refer}} were soundly defeated by [[Ulysses S. Grant]].\n\nAfter the [[assassination of James A. Garfield]] by a rejected office-seeker in 1881, the calls for civil service reform intensified. Moderation of the spoils system at the federal level came with the passage of the [[Pendleton Act]] in 1883, which created a bipartisan Civil Service Commission to evaluate job candidates on a nonpartisan merit basis. While few jobs were covered under the law initially, the law allowed the President to transfer jobs and their current holders into the system, thus giving the holder a permanent job.  The Pendleton Act's reach was expanded as the two main political parties alternated control of the [[White House]] every election between 1884 and 1896.  After each election the outgoing President applied the Pendleton Act to jobs held by his political supporters.  By 1900, most federal jobs were handled through civil service and the spoils system was limited only to very senior positions.\n\nThe separation between the political activity and the civil service was made stronger with the [[Hatch Act of 1939]] which prohibited federal employees from engaging in many political activities.\n\nThe spoils system survived much longer in many states, counties and municipalities, such as the [[Tammany Hall]] [[political machine|machine]], which survived well into the 1930s when [[New York City]] reformed its own civil service. [[Illinois]] modernized its bureaucracy in 1917 under [[Frank Lowden]], but [[Chicago]] held on to patronage in city government until the city agreed to end the practice in the [[Shakman Decrees]] of 1972 and 1983.\n\nModern variations on the spoils system are often described as the [[political machine]].\n\n==See also==\n* [[Cronyism]]\n* [[Political patronage]]\n* [[Political corruption]]\n* [[Separation of powers]]\n* [[Soft despotism]]\n* [[Whig Party (United States)]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Sources==\n* {{citebook|author= [[Timothy Gilfoyle]]|title=A Pickpocket's Tale: The Underworld of Nineteenth-Century New York|publisher=W.

The post office was the largest department in the federal government, and had even more personnel than the war department. In one year 423 postmasters were deprived of their positions, most with extensive records of good service.<ref name=howe2007 />{{rp|334}}\n\n==Reform==\nBy the late 1860s, citizens began demanding civil service reform. Running under the [[Liberal Republican Party (United States)|Liberal Republican Party]] in 1872, they {{clarify|date=February 2020 |reason=to whom does _they_ refer}} were soundly defeated by [[Ulysses S. Grant]].\n\nAfter the [[assassination of James A. Garfield]] by a rejected office-seeker in 1881, the calls for civil service reform intensified. Moderation of the spoils system at the federal level came with the passage of the [[Pendleton Act]] in 1883, which created a bipartisan Civil Service Commission to evaluate job candidates on a nonpartisan merit basis. While few jobs were covered under the law initially, the law allowed the President to transfer jobs and their current holders into the system, thus giving the holder a permanent job.  The Pendleton Act's reach was expanded as the two main political parties alternated control of the [[White House]] every election between 1884 and 1896.  After each election the outgoing President applied the Pendleton Act to jobs held by his political supporters.  By 1900, most federal jobs were handled through civil service and the spoils system was limited only to very senior positions.\n\nThe separation between the political activity and the civil service was made stronger with the [[Hatch Act of 1939]] which prohibited federal employees from engaging in many political activities.\n\nThe spoils system survived much longer in many states, counties and municipalities, such as the [[Tammany Hall]] [[political machine|machine]], which survived well into the 1930s when [[New York City]] reformed its own civil service. [[Illinois]] modernized its bureaucracy in 1917 under [[Frank Lowden]], but [[Chicago]] held on to patronage in city government until the city agreed to end the practice in the [[Shakman Decrees]] of 1972 and 1983.\n\nModern variations on the spoils system are often described as the [[political machine]].\n\n==See also==\n* [[Cronyism]]\n* [[Political patronage]]\n* [[Political corruption]]\n* [[Separation of powers]]\n* [[Soft despotism]]\n* [[Whig Party (United States)]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Sources==\n* {{citebook|author= [[Timothy Gilfoyle]]|title=A Pickpocket's Tale: The Underworld of Nineteenth-Century New York|publisher=W.

Numerous prehistoric, ancient and mediaeval archeological sites are evidence of the presence of a variety of different cultures. There are numerous settlements from the [[prehistoric period]], dating back to 2100 B.C., usually associated with burial sites. In the pre-Roman and Roman times the area was settled by a large Illyrian tribe [[Maezaei]], a sub-tribe of the Pannonians, renowned for their mining skills. In Ljubija near Prijedor, many Roman age monuments have been found that provide evidence of iron production. In Zecovi there is an Illyrian necropolis from the Iron Age. A legend says that the river Sana was named by the Romans.\n\n=== Ottoman and Austrian period ===\nPrijedor is mentioned for the first time as a small wooden fort in the list of those places in the [[Ottoman Empire]] that were devastate by Croatian troops between 1693 and 1696.<ref>HAMDIJA KRE\u0160EVLJAKOVI\u0106, 1953, STARI BOSANSKI GRADOVI (VIEUX BOURGS BOSNIAQUES)\nhttps://www.fmks.gov.ba/download/zzs/1953/1-1953.pdf #page= 29</ref>\nThese regions were under [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] dominion until 1878. About 200 years ago in this part of [[Bosnia]] a large number of fortifications were constructed in order to protect often contested borders with [[Austria]]. Later on, many fortifications were destroyed during the [[Great Turkish War|Austro-Ottoman War]] as the borders moved towards the east and south in favor of [[Austria]]. The first mention of the town, which refers to it as \u201cPalanka Praedor\u201d in a Latin written report of an Austrian field marshal about burnt fortified settlements, occurs between 1693 and 1696. The term ''\u201cPalanka\u201d'' indicates a wooden fortification built on an artificially created island on the river Sana. It is not clear how Prijedor got its name, but there are two theories. One of them refers to the term  ''\u201cprodor\u201d'' in the local tongue meaning penetration or penetration of the Sana river, which often flooded the entire area. The second theory concerns a race between a man and a horse (a horse is commonly known as ''\u201cDoro\u201d''). As the man won, it is said that the man reached the finish line before the horse, in the local language ''\u201cPrije Dore\u201d''.\n\nAt the same place in the middle of the 18th century, a new fortress appeared, this time built with stone walls, three towers and two clay causeways for the cannons. An archived information from [[Istanbul]] dated 1745 tells about two town guards crossing over to the newly built ''Palanka Pridorska Ada'' (island). It is the first mention of the fortress on the river Sana where the town developed later.\n\nWith the emergence of the fortification, the settlement outside of the walls began to develop at the same time. The settlers were probably a [[Christians|Christian]] population who lived in the vicinity and whose settlements rapidly merged with the town as it expanded to the north. Attesting to this is an account of an Austrian secret agent about the existence of the town for the purposes of the Austrian army, in which he described the town in detail and especially emphasized the suburb in its vicinity.\n\nThe town started to develop rapidly thanks to the navigability of the Sana River, the development of commerce and craft, and the later construction of the first railway through Prijedor. The first railroad in [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] was built in 1873 next to Prijedor and went from Dobrljina to Banja Luka. The fortress existed as a military spot until 1851 when the army left and the walls were demolished by the local population who used the walls to build their own houses. A huge fire in 1882 destroyed 119 houses, 56 big commercial stores, schools, an Eastern Orthodox church, and 140 families lost roofs over their heads. The next year the Austrian authorities opened a large sawmill at the foot of the mountain [[Kozara]], which is the first industrial object in the history of Prijedor.\n\nThe years after the fire brought on intensive development of the town, encompassing both private and state-owned structures. The wood was replaced with modern building materials, the streets were designed at right angles and the first town plan was created. New buildings were built, such as the Serbian elementary school, the Catholic Church, the Eastern Orthodox Church, and a hotel. The first cultural associations appeared in the town as well as libraries, reading rooms and a printing house. The end of the [[First World War]] created a fledgling state\u2014the [[Kingdom of Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes]]\u2014with [[Bosnia-Herzegovina]] as a part of it. Prijedor served as an important place as the trade and craft center of the whole region. The opening of the iron ore mine in Ljubija near Prijedor in 1916, which employed about 4,000 workers, strengthened the economy of the town. During that period, the mine was one of the biggest and most modern iron ore mines in Europe.\n{{Clear}}\n\nFrom 1929 to 1941, Prijedor was part of the [[Vrbas Banovina]] of the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]].\n\n=== World War II ===\nThe memorial center [[Monument to the Revolution (Kozara)|Mrakovica]] at Kozara, the work of the academic artist [[Du\u0161an D\u017eamonja]], is dedicated to this region's [[Yugoslav partisans]] resistance victims during WWII.\n\nSome villages around Prijedor and Kozara Mountain suffered the deaths of tremendous numbers of civilians, who were killed by the [[Usta\u0161e]] and taken to concentration camps; the most notorious of these was the [[Jastrebarsko concentration camp|Jastrebarsko Concentration Camp]],  where Serb children were imprisoned.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}\n\n=== Bosnian war ===\n{{see also|Prijedor ethnic cleansing}}\n\nDuring the [[Bosnian war]] (1992\u20131995), the area near Prijedor housed the infamous [[Omarska camp]], [[Keraterm camp]], and [[Trnopolje camp]] established in 1992 for the Bosniak and Croat population.<ref name=\"prijedor report\">{{cite web|title=The Prijedor report|url=http://www.ess.uwe.ac.uk/comexpert/ANX/V.htm#I-VI-VI|work=Final report of the United Nations Commission of Experts established pursuant to security council resolution 780 (1992)|author=United Nations \u2013 Security Council|date=28 December 1994|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081206012327/http://www.ess.uwe.ac.uk/comexpert/ANX/V.htm#I-VI-VI|archivedate=6 December 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Simons|first=Marlise|title=5 Bosnian Serbs Guilty of War Crimes at Infamous Camp|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/11/03/world/5-bosnian-serbs-guilty-of-war-crimes-at-infamous-camp.html|newspaper=The New York Times|date=3 November 2001}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Simons|first=Marlise|title=3 Ex-Guards at Bosnia Camp Are Sentenced by Hague Panel|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/11/14/world/3-ex-guards-at-bosnia-camp-are-sentenced-by-hague-panel.html|newspaper=The New York Times|date=14 November 2001}}</ref>\n\n==Demographics==\n\n=== Population ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!

There are numerous settlements from the [[prehistoric period]], dating back to 2100 B.C., usually associated with burial sites. In the pre-Roman and Roman times the area was settled by a large Illyrian tribe [[Maezaei]], a sub-tribe of the Pannonians, renowned for their mining skills. In Ljubija near Prijedor, many Roman age monuments have been found that provide evidence of iron production. In Zecovi there is an Illyrian necropolis from the Iron Age. A legend says that the river Sana was named by the Romans.\n\n=== Ottoman and Austrian period ===\nPrijedor is mentioned for the first time as a small wooden fort in the list of those places in the [[Ottoman Empire]] that were devastate by Croatian troops between 1693 and 1696.<ref>HAMDIJA KRE\u0160EVLJAKOVI\u0106, 1953, STARI BOSANSKI GRADOVI (VIEUX BOURGS BOSNIAQUES)\nhttps://www.fmks.gov.ba/download/zzs/1953/1-1953.pdf #page= 29</ref>\nThese regions were under [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] dominion until 1878. About 200 years ago in this part of [[Bosnia]] a large number of fortifications were constructed in order to protect often contested borders with [[Austria]]. Later on, many fortifications were destroyed during the [[Great Turkish War|Austro-Ottoman War]] as the borders moved towards the east and south in favor of [[Austria]]. The first mention of the town, which refers to it as \u201cPalanka Praedor\u201d in a Latin written report of an Austrian field marshal about burnt fortified settlements, occurs between 1693 and 1696. The term ''\u201cPalanka\u201d'' indicates a wooden fortification built on an artificially created island on the river Sana. It is not clear how Prijedor got its name, but there are two theories. One of them refers to the term  ''\u201cprodor\u201d'' in the local tongue meaning penetration or penetration of the Sana river, which often flooded the entire area. The second theory concerns a race between a man and a horse (a horse is commonly known as ''\u201cDoro\u201d''). As the man won, it is said that the man reached the finish line before the horse, in the local language ''\u201cPrije Dore\u201d''.\n\nAt the same place in the middle of the 18th century, a new fortress appeared, this time built with stone walls, three towers and two clay causeways for the cannons. An archived information from [[Istanbul]] dated 1745 tells about two town guards crossing over to the newly built ''Palanka Pridorska Ada'' (island). It is the first mention of the fortress on the river Sana where the town developed later.\n\nWith the emergence of the fortification, the settlement outside of the walls began to develop at the same time. The settlers were probably a [[Christians|Christian]] population who lived in the vicinity and whose settlements rapidly merged with the town as it expanded to the north. Attesting to this is an account of an Austrian secret agent about the existence of the town for the purposes of the Austrian army, in which he described the town in detail and especially emphasized the suburb in its vicinity.\n\nThe town started to develop rapidly thanks to the navigability of the Sana River, the development of commerce and craft, and the later construction of the first railway through Prijedor. The first railroad in [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] was built in 1873 next to Prijedor and went from Dobrljina to Banja Luka. The fortress existed as a military spot until 1851 when the army left and the walls were demolished by the local population who used the walls to build their own houses. A huge fire in 1882 destroyed 119 houses, 56 big commercial stores, schools, an Eastern Orthodox church, and 140 families lost roofs over their heads. The next year the Austrian authorities opened a large sawmill at the foot of the mountain [[Kozara]], which is the first industrial object in the history of Prijedor.\n\nThe years after the fire brought on intensive development of the town, encompassing both private and state-owned structures. The wood was replaced with modern building materials, the streets were designed at right angles and the first town plan was created. New buildings were built, such as the Serbian elementary school, the Catholic Church, the Eastern Orthodox Church, and a hotel. The first cultural associations appeared in the town as well as libraries, reading rooms and a printing house. The end of the [[First World War]] created a fledgling state\u2014the [[Kingdom of Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes]]\u2014with [[Bosnia-Herzegovina]] as a part of it. Prijedor served as an important place as the trade and craft center of the whole region. The opening of the iron ore mine in Ljubija near Prijedor in 1916, which employed about 4,000 workers, strengthened the economy of the town. During that period, the mine was one of the biggest and most modern iron ore mines in Europe.\n{{Clear}}\n\nFrom 1929 to 1941, Prijedor was part of the [[Vrbas Banovina]] of the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]].\n\n=== World War II ===\nThe memorial center [[Monument to the Revolution (Kozara)|Mrakovica]] at Kozara, the work of the academic artist [[Du\u0161an D\u017eamonja]], is dedicated to this region's [[Yugoslav partisans]] resistance victims during WWII.\n\nSome villages around Prijedor and Kozara Mountain suffered the deaths of tremendous numbers of civilians, who were killed by the [[Usta\u0161e]] and taken to concentration camps; the most notorious of these was the [[Jastrebarsko concentration camp|Jastrebarsko Concentration Camp]],  where Serb children were imprisoned.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}\n\n=== Bosnian war ===\n{{see also|Prijedor ethnic cleansing}}\n\nDuring the [[Bosnian war]] (1992\u20131995), the area near Prijedor housed the infamous [[Omarska camp]], [[Keraterm camp]], and [[Trnopolje camp]] established in 1992 for the Bosniak and Croat population.<ref name=\"prijedor report\">{{cite web|title=The Prijedor report|url=http://www.ess.uwe.ac.uk/comexpert/ANX/V.htm#I-VI-VI|work=Final report of the United Nations Commission of Experts established pursuant to security council resolution 780 (1992)|author=United Nations \u2013 Security Council|date=28 December 1994|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081206012327/http://www.ess.uwe.ac.uk/comexpert/ANX/V.htm#I-VI-VI|archivedate=6 December 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Simons|first=Marlise|title=5 Bosnian Serbs Guilty of War Crimes at Infamous Camp|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/11/03/world/5-bosnian-serbs-guilty-of-war-crimes-at-infamous-camp.html|newspaper=The New York Times|date=3 November 2001}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Simons|first=Marlise|title=3 Ex-Guards at Bosnia Camp Are Sentenced by Hague Panel|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/11/14/world/3-ex-guards-at-bosnia-camp-are-sentenced-by-hague-panel.html|newspaper=The New York Times|date=14 November 2001}}</ref>\n\n==Demographics==\n\n=== Population ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!

Look Busy (George Carlin).jpg|thumb|[[George Carlin]], the first person to host ''Saturday Night Live'']]\n''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' ('''''SNL''''') is a [[late night television|late-night]] [[sketch comedy]] and [[variety show]] created by [[Lorne Michaels]]. It premiered on [[NBC]], a [[terrestrial television|terrestrial]] [[television network]], on October 11, 1975 under the title ''NBC's Saturday Night''. The show usually satirizes contemporary American popular culture and politics. ''SNL'' features a two-tiered cast: the repertory members, also known as the \"Not Ready for Prime-Time Players\", and newer cast members, known as \"Featured Players.\"\n\nA typical episode of ''SNL'' will feature a single host, who delivers the opening monologue and performs in sketches with the cast.  While the format also features a musical guest, and a number of episodes have featured celebrity cameos, the focus of the show is the guest host.\n\n[[George Carlin]] was the first to host the show; [[Candice Bergen]] was the first woman to host the show a few weeks later and again hosted only six weeks after that. Guests that host five times (or more) are members of the Five-Timers Club that originated on December 8, 1990, when [[Tom Hanks]] became the seventh person to host their fifth episode.<ref name=\"The 5-Timers Club\" /> Occasionally, a host will also be the musical guest, such as first seen with [[Paul Simon]] on October 18, 1975, and most recently, [[Harry Styles]] on November 16, 2019.\n\n==List of ''Saturday Night Live'' hosts==\n{{main|List of Saturday Night Live guests (A\u2013D)|List of Saturday Night Live guests (E\u2013H)|List of Saturday Night Live guests (I\u2013L)|List of Saturday Night Live guests (M\u2013P)|List of Saturday Night Live guests (Q\u2013T)|List of Saturday Night Live guests (U\u2013Z)|l1=Guests (A\u2013D)|l2=(E\u2013H)|l3=(I\u2013L)|l4=(M\u2013P)|l5=(Q\u2013T)|l6=(U\u2013Z)}}\n\n''Saturday Night Live'' has featured a wide array of hosts and musical guests. [[George Carlin]] served as the show's first host in October 1975;<ref name=\"HostCarlin\"/> three episodes later, [[Candice Bergen]] became the first female host{{Sfn|Shales|Miller|2002|p=44}} and the first to host more than once.{{Sfn|Shales|Miller|2002|p=48}} Actor [[Alec Baldwin]] holds the record for most times hosting, having performed the duty on seventeen different occasions since 1990; Baldwin took the record from actor [[Steve Martin]] who has hosted fifteen times since 1976.<ref name=\"HostBaldwinRec\"/> \n\nSeveral former cast members have returned to take on hosting duties. Original cast member [[Chevy Chase]] has hosted the most times, eight in total. [[Tina Fey]] follows behind, having hosted six times, while [[Bill Murray]] and [[Will Ferrell]] have hosted five times. On December 11, 1982, [[Eddie Murphy]] became the only person to host while still a member of the cast, filling the role at the last minute when the scheduled host (his ''[[48 Hours (film)|48 Hours]]'' co-star [[Nick Nolte]]) became ill.<ref name=\"CastHosts1\"/><ref name=\"CastHosts2\"/>\n\nMusical guests can be solo acts or bands, who perform two to three musical numbers. Occasionally, the musical guest has also simultaneously served as the host. [[Paul Simon]] was the first example, hosting and performing on the second episode on October 18, 1975. As of December 16, 2017, [[Dave Grohl]] is the most frequent musical guest, performing on thirteen shows since 1992.<ref name=\"MusicalGrohl\"></ref><ref>{{cite news |last=Dresdale |first=Andrea |date= 2017-11-28 |title=Dave Grohl will make it a lucky 13 total appearances on \"Saturday Night Live\" next month  |url=http://abcnewsradioonline.com/music-news/2017/11/28/dave-grohl-will-make-it-a-lucky-13-total-appearances-on-satu.html |work=ABC News Radio |location=NY |access-date= 2019-10-24 }}</ref>\n\nIn 1982, at age 7, [[Drew Barrymore]] became the youngest person to host the show. Actress [[Betty White]] is the oldest person to host, having done so at 88 years of age on May 8, 2010.<ref name=\"YoungestOldest\"/> Concerned about White's age and possible fatigue, her episode had [[Tina Fey]], [[Molly Shannon]], [[Maya Rudolph]], [[Rachel Dratch]] and [[Amy Poehler]] on standby to replace her; White went on to appear in every sketch.<ref name=\"WhiteHosting\"/> In 2000, singer [[Britney Spears]] became the youngest person to both host and simultaneously serve as the show's musical guest, at 18 years and 161 days old.<ref name=\"YoungestSpears\"/>\n\nIn addition to making cameo appearances, political figures have also hosted the show. [[Donald Trump]], who hosted in 2004 (promoting the reality TV show ''[[The Apprentice (U.S. season 1)|The Apprentice]]'') and again in 2015 as a presidential hopeful, is the only host who eventually became President of the United States. [[Al Gore]] hosted in 2002, the only former Vice President to do so. Presidential candidates, either former, current, or future, have served as hosts: in addition to Trump and Gore, there was [[Ralph Nader]] (1977), [[Jesse Jackson]] and [[George McGovern]] (both 1984), [[Steve Forbes]] (1996), [[Rudy Giuliani]] (1997), [[John McCain]] (2002), and [[Al Sharpton]] (2003). [[Sarah Palin]] appeared on ''SNL'' in 2008 after weeks of Tina Fey doing impressions of her on the show. In 2020, [[Elizabeth Warren]] was featured in the cold open, though she was not the host.\n\n==Five-Timers Club==\nThe Five-Timers Club is the group of performers who have hosted ''SNL'' at least five times.<ref>{{cite web | last = Lyons | first = Margaret  | date= 2013-03-07 | url= https://www.vulture.com/2013/03/ranking-the-hosts-in-snls-five-timers-club.html  | title = Ranking the Hosts in ''Saturday Night Live''{{'}}s Five-Timers Club | work = [[Vulture (website)|Vulture]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | last = Fuster | first = Jeremy  | date= 2017-03-11  | url = https://www.thewrap.com/snl-five-timers-club-most-frequent-hosts-baldwin  | title = 'SNL' Five-Timers Club: Most Frequent Hosts, From Alec Baldwin to Justin Timberlake (Photos) | work = [[TheWrap]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | last = Wilson Hunt | first = Stacey  | date = 2015-02-11 | url= https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/snl-five-timers-club-justin-772382  | title = 'SNL' Five-Timers Club: Justin Timberlake, Alec Baldwin, Tom Hanks Share Wild and Crazy Tales of TV's Toughest Gig | work = [[The Hollywood Reporter]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.si.com/extra-mustard/2017/03/16/rock-hosting-saturday-night-live-finale  | title = The Rock to host Saturday Night Live season finale, set to join Five-Timers Club | work = [[Sports Illustrated]]}}</ref> ''SNL''{{'}}s first on-air mention of the Club occurred on December 8, 1990 when [[Tom Hanks]] in his monologue, touched upon the fact that it was his fifth appearance as host:\n{{quote|Believe it or not, this is the fifth ''Saturday Night Live'' I have been lucky enough to host.

Martin and Gould were both five-time hosts; Simon had only hosted four episodes, but was accepted as a member due to his numerous appearances as a musical guest. The Five-Timers Club was mentioned to have a [[swimming pool]] with perfect 80 degree waters. The food that is served there is named after ''SNL'' performers. Then-''Saturday Night Live'' writer [[Conan O'Brien]]  portrayed Sean, the [[Doorman (profession)|doorman]] of the club. [[Jon Lovitz]] appears as a club [[Waiting staff|waiter]]. [[Ralph Nader]] appears as a former ''SNL'' host trying to get into the Five-Timers Club only for Lovitz to tell him and his group to leave.\n\nThe second time the Five-Timers Club was mentioned was when [[Danny DeVito]] was inducted in 1993. The Club was mentioned again after the mark was reached by hosts [[John Goodman]] (1994), [[Alec Baldwin]] (1994), [[Christopher Walken]] (2001), [[Drew Barrymore]] (2007), [[Justin Timberlake]] (2013), [[Ben Affleck]] (2013), [[Scarlett Johansson]] (2017), [[Melissa McCarthy]] (2017), [[Dwayne Johnson]] (2017), and [[Jonah Hill]] (2018).\n\nJustin Timberlake's monologue from March 9, 2013 featured the reappearance of the richly appointed club. The sketch features Paul Simon, Steve Martin, [[Chevy Chase]], [[Alec Baldwin]], Tom Hanks, and [[Candice Bergen]].  There were portraits of John Goodman and Drew Barrymore in the Five-Timers Club's Hall of Portraits.  The staff at the Five-Timers Club are former cast members, with [[Dan Aykroyd]] (1975\u201379) and [[Martin Short]] (1984\u201385) appearing as the club's bartender and waiter, respectively. Future cast member [[Mike O'Brien (actor)|Mike O'Brien]] makes an appearance as the doorman who greets Timberlake. The entertainment at the Five-Timers Club involves making the current ''SNL'' performers fight each other to the death, with [[Bobby Moynihan]] shown fighting [[Taran Killam]]. When [[Melissa McCarthy]] hosted the show for the fifth time, Five-Timers Club member Steve Martin appeared in the goodnights to welcome her to the club. When [[Dwayne Johnson]] hosted the show for the fifth time, fellow five-timers Baldwin and Tom Hanks appeared in the monologue to welcome him to the club. \n\nOn November 3, 2018, the club is seen again as part of the monologue of actor/director [[Jonah Hill]].<ref>{{cite web |last1=Seemayer |first1=Zach |title=Jonah Hill Joins 'SNL' Five-Timers Club With Help From Tina Fey, Candice Bergen & Drew Barrymore |url=https://www.etonline.com/jonah-hill-joins-snl-five-timers-club-with-help-from-tina-fey-candice-bergen-drew-barrymore-112972 |website=etonline |accessdate=4 November 2018}}</ref> He is taken there by Five-Timer [[Tina Fey]] (her first appearance in the lounge). Once in, he is greeted by [[Candice Bergen]] and [[Drew Barrymore]]. Seeing no men in the club, Hill wonders if it's \"Ladies Night.\" He is told by Fey that the other men \"are not allowed in right now\" because of presumed harassment problems. [[Kenan Thompson]], working as staff that night, brings Bergen a drink called a \"[[Pete Davidson]].\" Hill is surprised to see Thompson there wondering if he is occasionally allowed in, to which Thompson replies, \"Yeah, man, this is my show. I let you in here sometimes,\" referencing Thompson's long tenure on the show. Eventually, Thompson brings Hill his jacket, which has been re-designed by the women in a more feminine cut.\n\nSteve Martin was the fastest to join the Five-Timers club, hosting five times in only 546 days.

The most recent to host five times is Will Ferrell (November 23, 2019).\n* Alec Baldwin holds the record for hosting ''SNL'' the most, with 17 episodes, beating out Steve Martin, with 15 episodes. In 2006, both made a cameo appearance when the other hosted, with Martin, up by one at the time, attempting to kill Baldwin before he could tie his record. When Baldwin hosted for the 15th time in 2010, Martin appeared on a television congratulating him during the monologue, but Baldwin turns and pushes him off the stage. On September 24, 2011, Baldwin finally broke Martin's record for most host appearances with his appearance on the 37th-season premiere; Martin appeared during the monologue to administer a drug test (a satirical reference to a long-running scandal regarding [[Banned substances in baseball in the United States|steroid use in Major League Baseball]]), wanting to make sure that the person who broke his record had done so fairly.\n* Chevy Chase was the first ''SNL'' cast member to come back and host the show, and the first to join the Five-Timers Club. Cast members Bill Murray, Tina Fey, and Will Ferrell later joined the Club; Fey is the only female cast alum in the Club.\n\nThe Five-Timers Club has been referenced in other media since its creation in 1990:\n*The entertainment channel [[E!]] placed it at No. 22 on its list of ''SNL'' top moments.{{fact|date=March 2017}}\n*The Club was referenced by [[Fox Sports]] writer [[Peter Schrager]] as his basis for the \"Favre Backup Club,\" a rundown of notable names who have held the spot behind [[National Football League|NFL]] quarterback [[Brett Favre]] on the [[depth chart]].<ref>{{cite web | last = Schrager | first = Peter | date= April 2007 | url = http://msn.foxsports.com/nfl/story/7263872  | title = Buffet: The men behind The Man | work = [[Fox Sports (USA)|Fox Sports]]|publisher  =  [[MSN]]| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20071123020641/http://msn.foxsports.com/nfl/story/7263872 | archive-date = 2007-11-23 }}</ref>\n*The Club has also been spoofed by ''SNL'' itself: [[Emma Stone]], during her fourth appearance as host in April 2019, anticipated \"Four-Timers Club\" honors in her monologue. To that end, she was given a hastily improvised song by [[Kate McKinnon]] and [[Kenan Thompson]]; a [[MedicAlert]] bracelet from the wrist of [[Aidy Bryant]] (in lieu of a gold card); \"cameos\" from various celebrities, which were in actuality impressions by [[Melissa Villase\u00f1or]] and [[Kyle Mooney]] (Stone was blindfolded beforehand); and a Four-Timers jacket by [[Chris Redd]] (it was really a jean jacket with the number 4 spray-painted on the back).\n\n==See also==\n* [[Saturday Night Live cast members|List of ''Saturday Night Live'' cast members]]\n* [[List of Saturday Night Live writers|List of ''Saturday Night Live'' writers]]\n* [[List of Saturday Night Live episodes|List of ''Saturday Night Live'' episodes]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em|refs=\n\n<ref name=\"CastHosts1\">{{cite news|first=Mike | last=Ryan| title=Power Rankings: How Have 24 Former SNL Stars Performed as Host? |url=http://movieline.com/2011/02/04/power-rankings-how-have-23-former-snl-stars-performed-as-host/|publisher=[[Movieline]] |work= | date=  2011-02-04  | accessdate= 2013-09-08 }}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"CastHosts2\">{{cite news|first=Mike | last=Ryan| title=Power Rankings: How Have 24 Former SNL Stars Performed as Host?

It premiered on [[NBC]], a [[terrestrial television|terrestrial]] [[television network]], on October 11, 1975 under the title ''NBC's Saturday Night''. The show usually satirizes contemporary American popular culture and politics. ''SNL'' features a two-tiered cast: the repertory members, also known as the \"Not Ready for Prime-Time Players\", and newer cast members, known as \"Featured Players.\"\n\nA typical episode of ''SNL'' will feature a single host, who delivers the opening monologue and performs in sketches with the cast.  While the format also features a musical guest, and a number of episodes have featured celebrity cameos, the focus of the show is the guest host.\n\n[[George Carlin]] was the first to host the show; [[Candice Bergen]] was the first woman to host the show a few weeks later and again hosted only six weeks after that. Guests that host five times (or more) are members of the Five-Timers Club that originated on December 8, 1990, when [[Tom Hanks]] became the seventh person to host their fifth episode.<ref name=\"The 5-Timers Club\" /> Occasionally, a host will also be the musical guest, such as first seen with [[Paul Simon]] on October 18, 1975, and most recently, [[Harry Styles]] on November 16, 2019.\n\n==List of ''Saturday Night Live'' hosts==\n{{main|List of Saturday Night Live guests (A\u2013D)|List of Saturday Night Live guests (E\u2013H)|List of Saturday Night Live guests (I\u2013L)|List of Saturday Night Live guests (M\u2013P)|List of Saturday Night Live guests (Q\u2013T)|List of Saturday Night Live guests (U\u2013Z)|l1=Guests (A\u2013D)|l2=(E\u2013H)|l3=(I\u2013L)|l4=(M\u2013P)|l5=(Q\u2013T)|l6=(U\u2013Z)}}\n\n''Saturday Night Live'' has featured a wide array of hosts and musical guests. [[George Carlin]] served as the show's first host in October 1975;<ref name=\"HostCarlin\"/> three episodes later, [[Candice Bergen]] became the first female host{{Sfn|Shales|Miller|2002|p=44}} and the first to host more than once.{{Sfn|Shales|Miller|2002|p=48}} Actor [[Alec Baldwin]] holds the record for most times hosting, having performed the duty on seventeen different occasions since 1990; Baldwin took the record from actor [[Steve Martin]] who has hosted fifteen times since 1976.<ref name=\"HostBaldwinRec\"/> \n\nSeveral former cast members have returned to take on hosting duties. Original cast member [[Chevy Chase]] has hosted the most times, eight in total. [[Tina Fey]] follows behind, having hosted six times, while [[Bill Murray]] and [[Will Ferrell]] have hosted five times. On December 11, 1982, [[Eddie Murphy]] became the only person to host while still a member of the cast, filling the role at the last minute when the scheduled host (his ''[[48 Hours (film)|48 Hours]]'' co-star [[Nick Nolte]]) became ill.<ref name=\"CastHosts1\"/><ref name=\"CastHosts2\"/>\n\nMusical guests can be solo acts or bands, who perform two to three musical numbers. Occasionally, the musical guest has also simultaneously served as the host. [[Paul Simon]] was the first example, hosting and performing on the second episode on October 18, 1975. As of December 16, 2017, [[Dave Grohl]] is the most frequent musical guest, performing on thirteen shows since 1992.<ref name=\"MusicalGrohl\"></ref><ref>{{cite news |last=Dresdale |first=Andrea |date= 2017-11-28 |title=Dave Grohl will make it a lucky 13 total appearances on \"Saturday Night Live\" next month  |url=http://abcnewsradioonline.com/music-news/2017/11/28/dave-grohl-will-make-it-a-lucky-13-total-appearances-on-satu.html |work=ABC News Radio |location=NY |access-date= 2019-10-24 }}</ref>\n\nIn 1982, at age 7, [[Drew Barrymore]] became the youngest person to host the show. Actress [[Betty White]] is the oldest person to host, having done so at 88 years of age on May 8, 2010.<ref name=\"YoungestOldest\"/> Concerned about White's age and possible fatigue, her episode had [[Tina Fey]], [[Molly Shannon]], [[Maya Rudolph]], [[Rachel Dratch]] and [[Amy Poehler]] on standby to replace her; White went on to appear in every sketch.<ref name=\"WhiteHosting\"/> In 2000, singer [[Britney Spears]] became the youngest person to both host and simultaneously serve as the show's musical guest, at 18 years and 161 days old.<ref name=\"YoungestSpears\"/>\n\nIn addition to making cameo appearances, political figures have also hosted the show. [[Donald Trump]], who hosted in 2004 (promoting the reality TV show ''[[The Apprentice (U.S. season 1)|The Apprentice]]'') and again in 2015 as a presidential hopeful, is the only host who eventually became President of the United States. [[Al Gore]] hosted in 2002, the only former Vice President to do so. Presidential candidates, either former, current, or future, have served as hosts: in addition to Trump and Gore, there was [[Ralph Nader]] (1977), [[Jesse Jackson]] and [[George McGovern]] (both 1984), [[Steve Forbes]] (1996), [[Rudy Giuliani]] (1997), [[John McCain]] (2002), and [[Al Sharpton]] (2003). [[Sarah Palin]] appeared on ''SNL'' in 2008 after weeks of Tina Fey doing impressions of her on the show. In 2020, [[Elizabeth Warren]] was featured in the cold open, though she was not the host.\n\n==Five-Timers Club==\nThe Five-Timers Club is the group of performers who have hosted ''SNL'' at least five times.<ref>{{cite web | last = Lyons | first = Margaret  | date= 2013-03-07 | url= https://www.vulture.com/2013/03/ranking-the-hosts-in-snls-five-timers-club.html  | title = Ranking the Hosts in ''Saturday Night Live''{{'}}s Five-Timers Club | work = [[Vulture (website)|Vulture]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | last = Fuster | DUPLICATE_first = Jeremy  | first = 2017-03-11  | url = https://www.thewrap.com/snl-five-timers-club-most-frequent-hosts-baldwin  | title = 'SNL' Five-Timers Club: Most Frequent Hosts, From Alec Baldwin to Justin Timberlake (Photos) | work = [[TheWrap]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | last = Wilson Hunt | first = Stacey  | date = 2015-02-11 | url= https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/snl-five-timers-club-justin-772382  | title = 'SNL' Five-Timers Club: Justin Timberlake, Alec Baldwin, Tom Hanks Share Wild and Crazy Tales of TV's Toughest Gig | work = [[The Hollywood Reporter]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.si.com/extra-mustard/2017/03/16/rock-hosting-saturday-night-live-finale  | title = The Rock to host Saturday Night Live season finale, set to join Five-Timers Club | work = [[Sports Illustrated]]}}</ref> ''SNL''{{'}}s first on-air mention of the Club occurred on December 8, 1990 when [[Tom Hanks]] in his monologue, touched upon the fact that it was his fifth appearance as host:\n{{quote|Believe it or not, this is the fifth ''Saturday Night Live'' I have been lucky enough to host.

Martin and Gould were both five-time hosts; Simon had only hosted four episodes, but was accepted as a member due to his numerous appearances as a musical guest. The Five-Timers Club was mentioned to have a [[swimming pool]] with perfect 80 degree waters. The food that is served there is named after ''SNL'' performers. Then-''Saturday Night Live'' writer [[Conan O'Brien]]  portrayed Sean, the [[Doorman (profession)|doorman]] of the club. [[Jon Lovitz]] appears as a club [[Waiting staff|waiter]]. [[Ralph Nader]] appears as a former ''SNL'' host trying to get into the Five-Timers Club only for Lovitz to tell him and his group to leave.\n\nThe second time the Five-Timers Club was mentioned was when [[Danny DeVito]] was inducted in 1993. The Club was mentioned again after the mark was reached by hosts [[John Goodman]] (1994), [[Alec Baldwin]] (1994), [[Christopher Walken]] (2001), [[Drew Barrymore]] (2007), [[Justin Timberlake]] (2013), [[Ben Affleck]] (2013), [[Scarlett Johansson]] (2017), [[Melissa McCarthy]] (2017), [[Dwayne Johnson]] (2017), and [[Jonah Hill]] (2018).\n\nJustin Timberlake's monologue from March 9, 2013 featured the reappearance of the richly appointed club. The sketch features Paul Simon, Steve Martin, [[Chevy Chase]], [[Alec Baldwin]], Tom Hanks, and [[Candice Bergen]].  There were portraits of John Goodman and Drew Barrymore in the Five-Timers Club's Hall of Portraits.  The staff at the Five-Timers Club are former cast members, with [[Dan Aykroyd]] (1975\u201379) and [[Martin Short]] (1984\u201385) appearing as the club's bartender and waiter, respectively. Future cast member [[Mike O'Brien (actor)|Mike O'Brien]] makes an appearance as the doorman who greets Timberlake. The entertainment at the Five-Timers Club involves making the current ''SNL'' performers fight each other to the death, with [[Bobby Moynihan]] shown fighting [[Taran Killam]]. When [[Melissa McCarthy]] hosted the show for the fifth time, Five-Timers Club member Steve Martin appeared in the goodnights to welcome her to the club. When [[Dwayne Johnson]] hosted the show for the fifth time, fellow five-timers Baldwin and Tom Hanks appeared in the monologue to welcome him to the club. \n\nOn November 3, 2018, the club is seen again as part of the monologue of actor/director [[Jonah Hill]].<ref>{{cite web |last1=Seemayer |first1=Zach |title=Jonah Hill Joins 'SNL' Five-Timers Club With Help From Tina Fey, Candice Bergen & Drew Barrymore |url=https://www.etonline.com/jonah-hill-joins-snl-five-timers-club-with-help-from-tina-fey-candice-bergen-drew-barrymore-112972 |website=etonline |accessdate=4 November 2018}}</ref> He is taken there by Five-Timer [[Tina Fey]] (her first appearance in the lounge).

Seeing no men in the club, Hill wonders if it's \"Ladies Night.\" He is told by Fey that the other men \"are not allowed in right now\" because of presumed harassment problems. [[Kenan Thompson]], working as staff that night, brings Bergen a drink called a \"[[Pete Davidson]].\" Hill is surprised to see Thompson there wondering if he is occasionally allowed in, to which Thompson replies, \"Yeah, man, this is my show.

Eventually, Thompson brings Hill his jacket, which has been re-designed by the women in a more feminine cut.\n\nSteve Martin was the fastest to join the Five-Timers club, hosting five times in only 546 days.

The most recent to host five times is Will Ferrell (November 23, 2019).\n* Alec Baldwin holds the record for hosting ''SNL'' the most, with 17 episodes, beating out Steve Martin, with 15 episodes. In 2006, both made a cameo appearance when the other hosted, with Martin, up by one at the time, attempting to kill Baldwin before he could tie his record. When Baldwin hosted for the 15th time in 2010, Martin appeared on a television congratulating him during the monologue, but Baldwin turns and pushes him off the stage. On September 24, 2011, Baldwin finally broke Martin's record for most host appearances with his appearance on the 37th-season premiere; Martin appeared during the monologue to administer a drug test (a satirical reference to a long-running scandal regarding [[Banned substances in baseball in the United States|steroid use in Major League Baseball]]), wanting to make sure that the person who broke his record had done so fairly.\n* Chevy Chase was the first ''SNL'' cast member to come back and host the show, and the first to join the Five-Timers Club. Cast members Bill Murray, Tina Fey, and Will Ferrell later joined the Club; Fey is the only female cast alum in the Club.\n\nThe Five-Timers Club has been referenced in other media since its creation in 1990:\n*The entertainment channel [[E!]] placed it at No. 22 on its list of ''SNL'' top moments.{{fact|date=March 2017}}\n*The Club was referenced by [[Fox Sports]] writer [[Peter Schrager]] as his basis for the \"Favre Backup Club,\" a rundown of notable names who have held the spot behind [[National Football League|NFL]] quarterback [[Brett Favre]] on the [[depth chart]].<ref>{{cite web | last = Schrager | first = Peter | date= April 2007 | url = http://msn.foxsports.com/nfl/story/7263872  | title = Buffet: The men behind The Man | work = [[Fox Sports (USA)|Fox Sports]]|publisher  =  [[MSN]]| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20071123020641/http://msn.foxsports.com/nfl/story/7263872 | archive-date = 2007-11-23 }}</ref>\n*The Club has also been spoofed by ''SNL'' itself: [[Emma Stone]], during her fourth appearance as host in April 2019, anticipated \"Four-Timers Club\" honors in her monologue. To that end, she was given a hastily improvised song by [[Kate McKinnon]] and [[Kenan Thompson]]; a [[MedicAlert]] bracelet from the wrist of [[Aidy Bryant]] (in lieu of a gold card); \"cameos\" from various celebrities, which were in actuality impressions by [[Melissa Villase\u00f1or]] and [[Kyle Mooney]] (Stone was blindfolded beforehand); and a Four-Timers jacket by [[Chris Redd]] (it was really a jean jacket with the number 4 spray-painted on the back).\n\n==See also==\n* [[Saturday Night Live cast members|List of ''Saturday Night Live'' cast members]]\n* [[List of Saturday Night Live writers|List of ''Saturday Night Live'' writers]]\n* [[List of Saturday Night Live episodes|List of ''Saturday Night Live'' episodes]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em|refs=\n\n<ref name=\"CastHosts1\">{{cite news|first=Mike | last=Ryan| title=Power Rankings: How Have 24 Former SNL Stars Performed as Host? |url=http://movieline.com/2011/02/04/power-rankings-how-have-23-former-snl-stars-performed-as-host/|publisher=[[Movieline]] |work= | date=  2011-02-04  | accessdate= 2013-09-08 }}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"CastHosts2\">{{cite news|first=Mike | last=Ryan| title=Power Rankings: How Have 24 Former SNL Stars Performed as Host?
