She was born in [[San Francisco|San Francisco, California]]. Gottlieb's professional career spans more than 50 years. She practiced architecture in and outside the U.S. as a prolific residential designer. Most of her domestic designs can be found in California, Washington, Idaho and Virginia. Gottlieb's works have been featured in various publications, exhibits, and the documentary video made about her work on 'The Gottlieb House' in Fairfax Station, Virginia.  Lois Davidson was an apprentice to [[Frank Lloyd Wright]] as a part of the [[Taliesin West|Taliesin Fellowship in Scottsdale, Arizona,]] and Wright's winter home and the western counterpart to [[Taliesin (studio)|Taliesin East]] in Spring Green, Wisconsin, 1948-1949. \n\n== Education ==\nGottlieb attended [[Stanford University]], where she studied pre-architecture, a combination of art and engineering before earning a Bachelor of Arts degree from1944 to 1947. \n\nIn the last quarter of her senior year, Gottlieb was about to graduate from Stanford University and did not know what to do with herself. she visited Frank Lloyd Wright's Hanna House [1936] near the university campus for one of the classes she took. As she would later recall, \"I was stunned and enchanted. lt was as though l had never heard music before and here was confronted with the visual equivalent of a Beethoven symphony.\" Driven by the appreciation for, and a desire to learn more about the design philosophy of Wright's architecture, Gottlieb applied and later accepted as an apprentice to the Taliesin Fellowship. She began a two-year journey of work and study with Wright in 1948; she was to discover that architecture could be \"a way of life\". Gottlieb was one of the few women who have been apprenticed to [[Frank Lloyd Wright]] as a Taliesin fellow. During her time at Taliesin, she worked on the Pratt house in Michigan, and the Walker house in Carmel, California.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Gottlieb, Lois Davidson.|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/47063813|title=A way of life : an apprenticeship with Frank Lloyd Wright|date=2001|publisher=Images Pub.

She was born in [[San Francisco|San Francisco, California]]. Gottlieb's professional career spans more than 50 years. She practiced architecture in and outside the U.S. as a prolific residential designer. Most of her domestic designs can be found in California, Washington, Idaho and Virginia. Gottlieb's works have been featured in various publications, exhibits, and the documentary video made about her work on 'The Gottlieb House' in Fairfax Station, Virginia.  Lois Davidson was an apprentice to [[Frank Lloyd Wright]] as a part of the [[Taliesin West|Taliesin Fellowship in Scottsdale, Arizona,]] and Wright's winter home and the western counterpart to [[Taliesin (studio)|Taliesin East]] in Spring Green, Wisconsin, 1948-1949. \n\n== Education ==\nGottlieb attended [[Stanford University]], where she studied pre-architecture, a combination of art and engineering before earning a Bachelor of Arts degree from1944 to 1947. \n\nIn the last quarter of her senior year, Gottlieb was about to graduate from Stanford University and did not know what to do with herself. she visited Frank Lloyd Wright's Hanna House [1936] near the university campus for one of the classes she took. As she would later recall, \"I was stunned and enchanted. lt was as though l had never heard music before and here was confronted with the visual equivalent of a Beethoven symphony.\" Driven by the appreciation for, and a desire to learn more about the design philosophy of Wright's architecture, Gottlieb applied and later accepted as an apprentice to the Taliesin Fellowship. She began a two-year journey of work and study with Wright in 1948; she was to discover that architecture could be \"a way of life\". Gottlieb was one of the few women who have been apprenticed to [[Frank Lloyd Wright]] as a Taliesin fellow. During her time at Taliesin, she worked on the Pratt house in Michigan, and the Walker house in Carmel, California.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Gottlieb, Lois Davidson.|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/47063813|title=A way of life : an apprenticeship with Frank Lloyd Wright|date=2001|publisher=Images Pub.

{"title_page": "Colonialism and the Olympic Games", "text_new": "{{Globalize|date=February 2015}}\nThe '''[[Olympic Games]]''' have been criticized as upholding (and in some cases increasing) the [[Colonialism|colonial]] policies and practices of some host nations and cities either in the name of the Olympics by associated parties or directly by official Olympic bodies, such as the International Olympic Committee, host organizing committees and official sponsors.\n\nCritics have argued that the Olympics have engaged in or caused: erroneous anthropological and colonial knowledge production; erasure; [[commodification]]<ref>Definition: \"...the process of transforming an object, idea, activity, or service into a commodity by capitalist economies.\" Beaster-Jones 2013, par. 1.</ref> and [[Cultural appropriation|appropriation]] of indigenous ceremonies and symbolism; theft and inappropriate display of indigenous objects; further encroachment on and support of the theft of indigenous lands; and neglect or intensification of poor social conditions for indigenous peoples. Such practices have been observed at: the [[1904 Summer Olympics]] in St. Louis, Missouri; the [[1976 Summer Olympics]] in Montreal, Quebec; the [[1988 Winter Olympics]] in Calgary, Alberta; the [[2008 Summer Olympics]] in Beijing, China; the [[2010 Winter Olympics]] in Vancouver, BC; the [[2012 Summer Olympics]] in London, England; the [[2014 Winter Olympics]] in Sochi, Krasnodar Krai; the [[2018 Winter Olympics]] in Pyeongchang, Gangwon Province; the [[2020 Summer Olympics]] in Tokyo, Japan and the [[2022 Winter Olympics]] in Beijing, China.\n\n== Olympic Games as a colonial force and recommendations ==\nAccording to writings by the founder of the modern Olympic Games, Pierre de Coubertin, sport and colonialism were logical companions. He called sports \"a vigorous instrument of the disciplining\" of colonized people, and viewed it as a calming force in the colonies.<ref>Coubertin, Pierre de (1912). \"Les sports et la Colonisation\", ''Revue Olympique'' (January): 7\u201310, cited in Schantz 2008, p. 177.</ref> O'Bonsawin writes that Olympism, as a ''philosophy'', speaks \"in truisms of equity, anti-discrimination, mutual recognition and respect, tolerance and solidarity\".<ref name=\"O'Bonsawin 2008, p. 144\">O'Bonsawin 2008, p. 144.</ref> But she and other critics argue that in reality Olympism serves as an ''apologetic'' for a movement that is actually \"deeply politicized and xenophobic\".<ref>Wamsley, Kevin B. \"Laying Olympism to Rest\", ''Post-Olympism? Questioning Sport in the Twentieth-First Century'', edited by John Bale and Mette Krogh Christensen, 231\u2013242. Oxford: Berg, 2004, quoted in O'Bonsawin 2008, p. 144.</ref> O'Bonsawin also argues that in encouraging Olympic participants to \"cast aside everyday lived experiences&nbsp;... shaped by such factors as race, gender, sexuality, religion, culture, ideology, and class\" Olympism itself erases the realities of marginalized peoples.<ref name=\"O'Bonsawin 2008, p. 144\" />\n\nTo address this erasure and the disparity between Olympism ideals and Games practice, O'Bonsawin recommends that the IOC restructure their bid evaluation process so that they can determine whether bidding countries respect the human rights and needs of marginalized peoples.<ref name=\"O'Bonsawin 2008, p. 153\">O'Bonsawin 2008, p. 153.</ref> Instrumental to this restructuring would be the inclusion of external consultation and evaluation.<ref name=\"O'Bonsawin 2008, p. 153\" />\n\n== Anthropology at the 1904 Summer Olympics in St. Louis, Missouri==\n[[File:Archery on Antropology days during 1904 Summer Olympics.jpg|thumb|right|Anthropological archery during the 1904 Summer Olympics]]\nThe 1904 Summer Olympics in St. Louis, Missouri, were held in conjunction with the [[Louisiana Purchase Exposition]] (also known as the St. Louis World's Fair), and were the first modern Olympic Games to be held in North America.<ref>International Olympic Committee. http://www.olympic.org/olympic-games. Retrieved 20 Feb 2013.</ref> Since the [[1889 Paris Exposition]], [[human zoos]], as a key feature of world's fairs, functioned as demonstrations of anthropological notions of race, progress, and civilization. These goals were followed also at the 1904 World's Fair. Fourteen hundred indigenous people from Southeast Asia, the Pacific Islands, East Asia, Africa, the Middle East, South America and North America were displayed in anthropological exhibits that showed them in their natural habitats.<ref>Parezo 2008, p. 63.</ref> Another 1600 indigenous people displayed their culture in other areas of the Louisiana Purchase Exposition (LPE),<ref>Brownell 2008, p. 32.</ref> including on the fairgrounds and at the Model School,<ref>Peavy, Linda and Ursula Smith, 2008, p. 246.</ref> where [[Indian Residential School|American Indian boarding schools]] students demonstrated their successful [[Cultural assimilation of Native Americans|assimilation]]. \n\nAccording to theorist Susan Brownell, world's fairs \u2013 with their inclusion of human zoos \u2013 and the Olympics were a logical fit at this time, as they \"were both linked to an underlying cultural logic that gave them a natural affinity\".<ref>Brownell, 2008, p. 29.</ref> Taking this natural fit to the next level, two key figures at the 1904 World's Fair \u2013 [[William John McGee]] and [[James Edward Sullivan]] \u2013 devised an event that would bring anthropology and sport together: Anthropology Days.\n\nW. J. McGee was the head of the Department of Anthropology at the LPE and the founding president of the new [[American Anthropological Association]].<ref>Brownell 2008, p. 14.</ref> \n\nWhile Anthropology Days were not officially part of the Olympics program, they were closely associated with each other at the time, and in history\u2014Brownell notes that even today historians still debate as to which of the LPE events were the \"real\" Olympic Games.<ref name=\"Brownell 2008, p. 3\">Brownell 2008, p. 3.</ref> Additionally, almost all of the 400 athletic events were referred to as \"Olympian,\"<ref name=\"Brownell 2008, p. 3\" /> and the opening ceremony was held in May<ref name=\"Brownell 2008, p. 43\">Brownell 2008, p. 43.</ref> with dignitaries in attendance, though the official Olympic program did not begin until July 1.<ref name=\"Brownell 2008, p. 43\" /> Also, as previously noted, one of the original intentions of Anthropology Days was to create publicity for the official Olympic events.<ref name=\"Parezo 2008, p. 84\">Parezo 2008, p. 84.</ref><ref>Brownell 2008, p. 34.</ref>\n\nAnthropology Days took place on August 11 and 12, 1904, with about 100 paid indigenous men enlisted from among the human zoos, Model School and the rest of the fair grounds (no women participated in Anthropology Days, though some, notably the [[Fort Shaw Indian School]] girls basketball team, did compete in other athletic events at the LPE). Contests included \"baseball throwing, shot put, running, broad jumping, weight lifting, pole climbing, and tugs-of-war before a crowd of approximately ten thousand\".<ref>Parezo 2008, p. 59.</ref>\n\n== Spectacle and appropriation at the 1976 Summer Olympics in Montreal, Quebec==\nThe 1976 Summer Olympics have been criticized for a lack of consultation and the [[Spectacle|spectacular]] display of indigenous people in the closing ceremony. Sport scholar Christine O'Bonsawin explains how \"Montreal organizers strategically included indigenous people and imagery in the closing ceremony at a time when Canadian indigenous and government relations were operating under heightened tensions\".<ref>O'Bonsawin 2012, p. 37.</ref> She is referring to then Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau's 1969 Statement of the Government of Canada on Indian Policy (also called the [[1969 White Paper|White Paper]]), which was perceived by some Canadian indigenous people as a further attempt at assimilation.<ref>O'Bonsawin 2012, pp. 37\u201338.</ref>\n\nO'Bonsawin describes how amid these tensions the Montreal Olympic Games' closing ceremony employed indigenous symbolism without consultation with local First Nations.<ref name=\"O'Bonsawin 2012, p. 39\">O'Bonsawin 2012, p. 39.</ref> Hundreds of performers were enlisted to perform a \"tribal\" dance that was choreographed by a non-indigenous choreographer, to a musical score (\"La Danse Sauvage\") created by a non-indigenous composer.<ref name=\"O'Bonsawin 2012, p. 40\">O'Bonsawin 2012, p. 40.</ref> Only 200 of the 450 performers were indigenous, with the other 250 being non-indigenous people costumed and painted in \"[[Blackface|redface]]\"\u2014it was these non-indigenous performers who led the indigenous people into the stadium.<ref name=\"O'Bonsawin 2012, p. 39\" /> O'Bonsawin notes that particularly problematic about this approach to including indigenous \"participation\" is that it became a model for future Canadian Olympic Games.<ref name=\"O'Bonsawin 2012, p. 40\" />\n\n== Claims of cultural theft and erasure at the 1988 Winter Olympics in Calgary, Alberta ==\nThe [[1988 Winter Olympics]] in Calgary, Alberta reflected some lessons learned from criticism of the 1976 games, but according to critics, they still perpetuated legacies of erasure, cultural and land theft, and appropriation committed by past Games and Canadian governmental bodies.\n\nO'Bonsawin writes that there was significant protest from indigenous people against the use and appropriation of indigenous imagery in the 1988 Winter Games.<ref>O'Bonsawin 2012, p. 41.</ref> This imagery included \"indigenous sounds, sights, and images [and] a massive teepee\" in the opening ceremony,<ref>O'Bonsawin 2012, p. 49.</ref> and medals depicting \"winter sporting equipment protruding from a ceremonial headdress\".<ref>O'Bonsawin 2010, p. 147.</ref>\n\nThe 1988 Winter Games were also the subject of an international boycott called by the [[Lubicon Lake Indian Nation]], a small community in northern Alberta. Their reasons centered around what they considered the illegal sale of their [[Aboriginal land claims|unceded lands]] to oil companies\u2014unceded because they had been left out of the 1899 and 1900 treaties and the federal government was still not willing to negotiate a treaty.<ref>O'Bonsawin 2012, p. 42.</ref> While corporations extracted resources from their lands, the Lubicon Cree were experiencing \"a 93% decline in their annual trapping income, high rates of alcoholism, a tuberculosis crisis, and malnourishment in the community\".<ref>Ferreira, D.A. (1992). \"Oil and Lubicons don't mix: A land claim in northern Alberta in historical perspective\", ''Canadian Journal of Native Studies''. 12(1): 1-35, cited by O'Bonsawin 2012, p. 42.</ref>\n\nThe Lubicon Cree focused their boycott on a specific Olympic event: ''The Spirit Sings'' exhibit at the [[Glenbow Museum]], part of the official cultural programming of the Games. They protested this exhibit on several grounds, including that almost half of its funding came from [[Shell Oil Canada]]\u2014the very company drilling for oil on their unceded land.<ref>Cooper 2008, p. 22.</ref> The exhibit consisted of indigenous Canadian artifacts, art and objects gathered from collections around the world.<ref>O'Bonsawin 2012, p. 43.</ref> Of this, Lubicon Chief [[Bernard Ominayak]] said: \"[The] irony of using a display of North American Indian artifacts to attract people to the Winter Olympics being organized by interests who are still actively seeking to destroy Indian people seems painfully obvious.\"<ref>Ominayak, Chief Bernard (1989) \"Aboriginal land rights in Canada \u2013 myth and reality\", NISTO \u2013 Lubicon Lake Indian Nation. http://nisto.com/cree/lubicon/, cited in O'Bonsawin 2012, p. 43.</ref>\n\nThe Lubicon Cree claimed that the 665 artifacts in the exhibit had originally been stolen\u2014expatriated from indigenous communities and displayed in Europe for public consumption and curiosity.<ref name=\"O'Bonsawin 2012, p. 44\">O'Bonsawin 2012, p. 44.</ref> Additionally \"many of the objects were sacred and not intended for public display\", including a [[Mohawk people|Mohawk]] [[False Face mask]].<ref name=\"O'Bonsawin 2012, p. 44\" /> O'Bonsawin discusses how the Glenbow Museum committed a \"second and more disgraceful wave of thievery\" by returning the artifacts to the collections and museums who had loaned them, and refusing to assist indigenous groups in getting these items repatriated back to their communities.<ref name=\"O'Bonsawin 2012, p. 44\" /> The discourse generated by the Lubicon boycott of ''The Spirit Sings'' resulted in the formation of a task force that eventually released a ground-breaking report that continues to influence how museum professionals approach working with indigenous communities.<ref>Cooper 2008, pp. 25\u201328.</ref>\n\nIn addition to the boycott of ''The Spirit Sings'', the torch relay run was targeted by protesters for its sponsorship by [[Petro-Canada]], which was \"invading indigenous territories (including Lubicon lands) across Canada\".<ref>O'Bonsawin 2012, p. 47.</ref> Indigenous objection was not confined to the Lubicon Cree since \"protestors were present along the relay route in every province except [[Prince Edward Island]]\".<ref name=\"O'Bonsawin 2012, p. 48\">O'Bonsawin 2012, p. 48.</ref> Of these protests, former Olympiques Calgary Olympics (OCO) chairperson later wrote: \"There was no room for defiance or confrontation&nbsp;...\"<ref name=\"O'Bonsawin 2012, p. 48\" />\n\n== Tibetan unrest at the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing, China ==\n{{See also|2008 Tibetan unrest|Tibetan independence movement}}\n\n[[File:Free Tibet banner.jpg|thumb|left|150px|The {{convert|140|sqft|m2|abbr=on}} banner which read \"ONE WORLD ONE DREAM FREE TIBET\"]]\nSome [[International Tibet Independence Movement|pro-Tibetan independence]] groups, such as [[Students for a Free Tibet]], initiated a campaign against the Beijing 2008 Summer Olympics<ref>{{cite news | title = Protests, Smog Cloud Olympics a Year Out | agency=Associated Press | first = Stephan | last = Wade |date=7 August 2008}}</ref> to protest for Tibetan independence, It also objected to the use of the [[Tibetan antelope]] (chiru) as the [[Fuwa]] Yingying.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.studentsforafreetibet.org/article.php?list=type&type=15 | title = Free Tibet 2008! \u2013 One World, One Dream: Free Tibet 2008 | accessdate = 8 January 2007 | publisher = Students for a Free Tibet | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070101074244/http://www.studentsforafreetibet.org/article.php?list=type&type=15 | archive-date = 1 January 2007 | url-status = dead | df = dmy-all }}</ref> The Tibetan People's Movement has also demanded representation of [[Tibet]] with its own national flag.

Such practices have been observed at: the [[1904 Summer Olympics]] in St. Louis, Missouri; the [[1976 Summer Olympics]] in Montreal, Quebec; the [[1988 Winter Olympics]] in Calgary, Alberta; the [[2008 Summer Olympics]] in Beijing, China; the [[2010 Winter Olympics]] in Vancouver, BC; the [[2012 Summer Olympics]] in London, England; the [[2014 Winter Olympics]] in Sochi, Krasnodar Krai; the [[2018 Winter Olympics]] in Pyeongchang, Gangwon Province; the [[2020 Summer Olympics]] in Tokyo, Japan and the [[2022 Winter Olympics]] in Beijing, China.\n\n== Olympic Games as a colonial force and recommendations ==\nAccording to writings by the founder of the modern Olympic Games, Pierre de Coubertin, sport and colonialism were logical companions. He called sports \"a vigorous instrument of the disciplining\" of colonized people, and viewed it as a calming force in the colonies.<ref>Coubertin, Pierre de (1912). \"Les sports et la Colonisation\", ''Revue Olympique'' (January): 7\u201310, cited in Schantz 2008, p. 177.</ref> O'Bonsawin writes that Olympism, as a ''philosophy'', speaks \"in truisms of equity, anti-discrimination, mutual recognition and respect, tolerance and solidarity\".<ref name=\"O'Bonsawin 2008, p. 144\">O'Bonsawin 2008, p. 144.</ref> But she and other critics argue that in reality Olympism serves as an ''apologetic'' for a movement that is actually \"deeply politicized and xenophobic\".<ref>Wamsley, Kevin B. \"Laying Olympism to Rest\", ''Post-Olympism? Questioning Sport in the Twentieth-First Century'', edited by John Bale and Mette Krogh Christensen, 231\u2013242. Oxford: Berg, 2004, quoted in O'Bonsawin 2008, p. 144.</ref> O'Bonsawin also argues that in encouraging Olympic participants to \"cast aside everyday lived experiences&nbsp;... shaped by such factors as race, gender, sexuality, religion, culture, ideology, and class\" Olympism itself erases the realities of marginalized peoples.<ref name=\"O'Bonsawin 2008, p. 144\" />\n\nTo address this erasure and the disparity between Olympism ideals and Games practice, O'Bonsawin recommends that the IOC restructure their bid evaluation process so that they can determine whether bidding countries respect the human rights and needs of marginalized peoples.<ref name=\"O'Bonsawin 2008, p. 153\">O'Bonsawin 2008, p. 153.</ref> Instrumental to this restructuring would be the inclusion of external consultation and evaluation.<ref name=\"O'Bonsawin 2008, p. 153\" />\n\n== Anthropology at the 1904 Summer Olympics in St. Louis, Missouri==\n[[File:Archery on Antropology days during 1904 Summer Olympics.jpg|thumb|right|Anthropological archery during the 1904 Summer Olympics]]\nThe 1904 Summer Olympics in St. Louis, Missouri, were held in conjunction with the [[Louisiana Purchase Exposition]] (also known as the St. Louis World's Fair), and were the first modern Olympic Games to be held in North America.<ref>International Olympic Committee. http://www.olympic.org/olympic-games. Retrieved 20 Feb 2013.</ref> Since the [[1889 Paris Exposition]], [[human zoos]], as a key feature of world's fairs, functioned as demonstrations of anthropological notions of race, progress, and civilization. These goals were followed also at the 1904 World's Fair. Fourteen hundred indigenous people from Southeast Asia, the Pacific Islands, East Asia, Africa, the Middle East, South America and North America were displayed in anthropological exhibits that showed them in their natural habitats.<ref>Parezo 2008, p. 63.</ref> Another 1600 indigenous people displayed their culture in other areas of the Louisiana Purchase Exposition (LPE),<ref>Brownell 2008, p. 32.</ref> including on the fairgrounds and at the Model School,<ref>Peavy, Linda and Ursula Smith, 2008, p. 246.</ref> where [[Indian Residential School|American Indian boarding schools]] students demonstrated their successful [[Cultural assimilation of Native Americans|assimilation]]. \n\nAccording to theorist Susan Brownell, world's fairs \u2013 with their inclusion of human zoos \u2013 and the Olympics were a logical fit at this time, as they \"were both linked to an underlying cultural logic that gave them a natural affinity\".<ref>Brownell, 2008, p. 29.</ref> Taking this natural fit to the next level, two key figures at the 1904 World's Fair \u2013 [[William John McGee]] and [[James Edward Sullivan]] \u2013 devised an event that would bring anthropology and sport together: Anthropology Days.\n\nW. J. McGee was the head of the Department of Anthropology at the LPE and the founding president of the new [[American Anthropological Association]].<ref>Brownell 2008, p. 14.</ref> \n\nWhile Anthropology Days were not officially part of the Olympics program, they were closely associated with each other at the time, and in history\u2014Brownell notes that even today historians still debate as to which of the LPE events were the \"real\" Olympic Games.<ref name=\"Brownell 2008, p. 3\">Brownell 2008, p. 3.</ref> Additionally, almost all of the 400 athletic events were referred to as \"Olympian,\"<ref name=\"Brownell 2008, p. 3\" /> and the opening ceremony was held in May<ref name=\"Brownell 2008, p. 43\">Brownell 2008, p. 43.</ref> with dignitaries in attendance, though the official Olympic program did not begin until July 1.<ref name=\"Brownell 2008, p. 43\" /> Also, as previously noted, one of the original intentions of Anthropology Days was to create publicity for the official Olympic events.<ref name=\"Parezo 2008, p. 84\">Parezo 2008, p. 84.</ref><ref>Brownell 2008, p. 34.</ref>\n\nAnthropology Days took place on August 11 and 12, 1904, with about 100 indigenous men enlisted from among the human zoos, Model School and the rest of the fair grounds (no women participated in Anthropology Days, though some, notably the [[Fort Shaw Indian School]] girls basketball team, did compete in other athletic events at the LPE). Contests included \"baseball throwing, shot put, running, broad jumping, weight lifting, pole climbing, and tugs-of-war before a crowd of approximately ten thousand\".<ref>Parezo 2008, p. 59.</ref>\n\n== Spectacle and appropriation at the 1976 Summer Olympics in Montreal, Quebec==\nThe 1976 Summer Olympics have been criticized for a lack of consultation and the [[Spectacle|spectacular]] display of indigenous people in the closing ceremony. Sport scholar Christine O'Bonsawin explains how \"Montreal organizers strategically included indigenous people and imagery in the closing ceremony at a time when Canadian indigenous and government relations were operating under heightened tensions\".<ref>O'Bonsawin 2012, p. 37.</ref> She is referring to then Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau's 1969 Statement of the Government of Canada on Indian Policy (also called the [[1969 White Paper|White Paper]]), which was perceived by some Canadian indigenous people as a further attempt at assimilation.<ref>O'Bonsawin 2012, pp. 37\u201338.</ref>\n\nO'Bonsawin describes how amid these tensions the Montreal Olympic Games' closing ceremony employed indigenous symbolism without consultation with local First Nations.<ref name=\"O'Bonsawin 2012, p. 39\">O'Bonsawin 2012, p. 39.</ref> Hundreds of performers were enlisted to perform a \"tribal\" dance that was choreographed by a non-indigenous choreographer, to a musical score (\"La Danse Sauvage\") created by a non-indigenous composer.<ref name=\"O'Bonsawin 2012, p. 40\">O'Bonsawin 2012, p. 40.</ref> Only 200 of the 450 performers were indigenous, with the other 250 being non-indigenous people costumed and painted in \"[[Blackface|redface]]\"\u2014it was these non-indigenous performers who led the indigenous people into the stadium.<ref name=\"O'Bonsawin 2012, p. 39\" /> O'Bonsawin notes that particularly problematic about this approach to including indigenous \"participation\" is that it became a model for future Canadian Olympic Games.<ref name=\"O'Bonsawin 2012, p. 40\" />\n\n== Claims of cultural theft and erasure at the 1988 Winter Olympics in Calgary, Alberta ==\nThe [[1988 Winter Olympics]] in Calgary, Alberta reflected some lessons learned from criticism of the 1976 games, but according to critics, they still perpetuated legacies of erasure, cultural and land theft, and appropriation committed by past Games and Canadian governmental bodies.\n\nO'Bonsawin writes that there was significant protest from indigenous people against the use and appropriation of indigenous imagery in the 1988 Winter Games.<ref>O'Bonsawin 2012, p. 41.</ref> This imagery included \"indigenous sounds, sights, and images [and] a massive teepee\" in the opening ceremony,<ref>O'Bonsawin 2012, p. 49.</ref> and medals depicting \"winter sporting equipment protruding from a ceremonial headdress\".<ref>O'Bonsawin 2010, p. 147.</ref>\n\nThe 1988 Winter Games were also the subject of an international boycott called by the [[Lubicon Lake Indian Nation]], a small community in northern Alberta. Their reasons centered around what they considered the illegal sale of their [[Aboriginal land claims|unceded lands]] to oil companies\u2014unceded because they had been left out of the 1899 and 1900 treaties and the federal government was still not willing to negotiate a treaty.<ref>O'Bonsawin 2012, p. 42.</ref> While corporations extracted resources from their lands, the Lubicon Cree were experiencing \"a 93% decline in their annual trapping income, high rates of alcoholism, a tuberculosis crisis, and malnourishment in the community\".<ref>Ferreira, D.A. (1992). \"Oil and Lubicons don't mix: A land claim in northern Alberta in historical perspective\", ''Canadian Journal of Native Studies''. 12(1): 1-35, cited by O'Bonsawin 2012, p. 42.</ref>\n\nThe Lubicon Cree focused their boycott on a specific Olympic event: ''The Spirit Sings'' exhibit at the [[Glenbow Museum]], part of the official cultural programming of the Games. They protested this exhibit on several grounds, including that almost half of its funding came from [[Shell Oil Canada]]\u2014the very company drilling for oil on their unceded land.<ref>Cooper 2008, p. 22.</ref> The exhibit consisted of indigenous Canadian artifacts, art and objects gathered from collections around the world.<ref>O'Bonsawin 2012, p. 43.</ref> Of this, Lubicon Chief [[Bernard Ominayak]] said: \"[The] irony of using a display of North American Indian artifacts to attract people to the Winter Olympics being organized by interests who are still actively seeking to destroy Indian people seems painfully obvious.\"<ref>Ominayak, Chief Bernard (1989) \"Aboriginal land rights in Canada \u2013 myth and reality\", NISTO \u2013 Lubicon Lake Indian Nation. http://nisto.com/cree/lubicon/, cited in O'Bonsawin 2012, p. 43.</ref>\n\nThe Lubicon Cree claimed that the 665 artifacts in the exhibit had originally been stolen\u2014expatriated from indigenous communities and displayed in Europe for public consumption and curiosity.<ref name=\"O'Bonsawin 2012, p. 44\">O'Bonsawin 2012, p. 44.</ref> Additionally \"many of the objects were sacred and not intended for public display\", including a [[Mohawk people|Mohawk]] [[False Face mask]].<ref name=\"O'Bonsawin 2012, p. 44\" /> O'Bonsawin discusses how the Glenbow Museum committed a \"second and more disgraceful wave of thievery\" by returning the artifacts to the collections and museums who had loaned them, and refusing to assist indigenous groups in getting these items repatriated back to their communities.<ref name=\"O'Bonsawin 2012, p. 44\" /> The discourse generated by the Lubicon boycott of ''The Spirit Sings'' resulted in the formation of a task force that eventually released a ground-breaking report that continues to influence how museum professionals approach working with indigenous communities.<ref>Cooper 2008, pp. 25\u201328.</ref>\n\nIn addition to the boycott of ''The Spirit Sings'', the torch relay run was targeted by protesters for its sponsorship by [[Petro-Canada]], which was \"invading indigenous territories (including Lubicon lands) across Canada\".<ref>O'Bonsawin 2012, p. 47.</ref> Indigenous objection was not confined to the Lubicon Cree since \"protestors were present along the relay route in every province except [[Prince Edward Island]]\".<ref name=\"O'Bonsawin 2012, p. 48\">O'Bonsawin 2012, p. 48.</ref> Of these protests, former Olympiques Calgary Olympics (OCO) chairperson later wrote: \"There was no room for defiance or confrontation&nbsp;...\"<ref name=\"O'Bonsawin 2012, p. 48\" />\n\n== Tibetan unrest at the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing, China ==\n{{See also|2008 Tibetan unrest|Tibetan independence movement}}\n\n[[File:Free Tibet banner.jpg|thumb|left|150px|The {{convert|140|sqft|m2|abbr=on}} banner which read \"ONE WORLD ONE DREAM FREE TIBET\"]]\nSome [[International Tibet Independence Movement|pro-Tibetan independence]] groups, such as [[Students for a Free Tibet]], initiated a campaign against the Beijing 2008 Summer Olympics<ref>{{cite news | title = Protests, Smog Cloud Olympics a Year Out | agency=Associated Press | first = Stephan | last = Wade |date=7 August 2008}}</ref> to protest for Tibetan independence, It also objected to the use of the [[Tibetan antelope]] (chiru) as the [[Fuwa]] Yingying.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.studentsforafreetibet.org/article.php?list=type&type=15 | title = Free Tibet 2008! \u2013 One World, One Dream: Free Tibet 2008 | accessdate = 8 January 2007 | publisher = Students for a Free Tibet | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070101074244/http://www.studentsforafreetibet.org/article.php?list=type&type=15 | archive-date = 1 January 2007 | url-status = dead | df = dmy-all }}</ref> The Tibetan People's Movement has also demanded representation of [[Tibet]] with its own national flag.

To limit the resulting flame temperatures to levels common during conventional combustion, cooled flue gas is recirculated and injected into the combustion chamber. The flue gas consists of mainly carbon dioxide and water vapour, the latter of which is condensed through cooling. The result is an almost pure carbon dioxide stream that can be transported to the sequestration site and stored. Power plant processes based on oxyfuel combustion are sometimes referred to as \"zero emission\" cycles, because the {{co2}} stored is not a fraction removed from the flue gas stream (as in the cases of pre- and post-combustion capture) but the flue gas stream itself. A certain fraction of the {{co2}} generated during combustion will inevitably end up in the condensed water. To warrant the label \"zero emission\" the water would thus have to be treated or disposed of appropriately.\n\n=== {{co2}} separation technologies ===\n\nCarbon dioxide can be separated out of air or flue gas with [[absorption (chemistry)|absorption]], [[adsorption]], or [[membrane gas separation]] technologies. Absorption, or [[carbon dioxide scrubber|carbon scrubbing]], with [[amines]] is the dominant capture technology.\n\nCarbon dioxide adsorbs to a MOF ([[Metal\u2013organic framework]]) through [[physisorption]] or [[chemisorption]] based on the porosity and [[Sensitivity and specificity|selectivity]] of the MOF leaving behind a [[Greenhouse gas]] poor gas stream that is more environmentally friendly. The carbon dioxide is then stripped off the MOF using temperature swing adsorption (TSA) or pressure swing adsorption (PSA) so the MOF can be reused. Adsorbents and absorbents require regeneration steps where the {{co2}} is removed from the sorbent or solution that collected it out of the flue gas in order for the sorbent or solution to be reused. Monoethanolamine (MEA) solutions, the leading amine for capturing {{co2}}, have a heat capacity between 3\u20134 J/g K since they are mostly water.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Herm | first1 = Zoey R. | last2 = Swisher | first2 = Joseph A. | last3 = Smit | first3 = Berend | last4 = Krishna | first4 = Rajamani | last5 = Long | first5 = Jeffrey R. | year = 2011 | title = Metal\u2212Organic Frameworks as Adsorbents for Hydrogen Purification and Precombustion Carbon Dioxide Capture | journal = Journal of the American Chemical Society | volume = 133 | issue = 15| pages = 5664\u20135667 | doi = 10.1021/ja111411q | pmid = 21438585 | url = http://infoscience.epfl.ch/record/200724 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Kulkarni | first1 = Ambarish R. | last2 = Sholl | first2 = David S. | year = 2012 | title = Analysis of Equilibrium-Based TSA Processes for Direct Capture of CO2 from Air | journal = Industrial & Engineering Chemistry Research | volume = 51 | issue = 25| pages = 8631\u20138645 | doi = 10.1021/ie300691c }}</ref> Higher heat capacities add to the energy penalty in the solvent regeneration step.

The water vapor is condensed, leaving pure carbon dioxide, which can then be sequestered.  The solid metal particles are circulated to another fluidized bed where they react with air, producing heat and regenerating metal oxide particles that are recirculated to the fluidized bed combustor.

The technical feasibility, however, depends on the permeability of the coal bed. In the process of absorption the coal releases previously absorbed [[methane]], and the methane can be recovered ([[enhanced coal bed methane recovery]]). The sale of the methane can be used to offset a portion of the cost of the {{co2}} storage. Burning the resultant methane, however, would negate some of the benefit of sequestering the original {{co2}}.\n\nSaline formations contain highly mineralized brines, and have so far been considered of no benefit to humans. Saline aquifers have been used for storage of chemical waste in a few cases. The main advantage of saline aquifers is their large potential storage volume and their common occurrence. The major disadvantage of saline aquifers is that relatively little is known about them, especially compared to oil fields.

Leakage due to injection at improper locations or conditions could result in carbon dioxide being released back into the atmosphere. It is important to be able to detect leaks with enough warning to put a stop to it, and to be able to quantify the amount of carbon that has leaked for purposes such as [[cap and trade]] policies, evaluation of environmental impact of leaked carbon, as well as accounting for the total loss and cost of the process. To quantify the amount of carbon dioxide released, should a leak occur, or to closely watch stored {{co2}}, there are several monitoring methods that can be done at both the surface and subsurface levels.<ref name=main>{{cite book|last1=Smit|first1=Berend|last2=Reimer|first2=Jeffery A.|last3=Oldenburg|first3=Curtis M.|last4=Bourg|first4=Ian C.|title=Introduction to Carbon Capture and Sequestration|publisher=Imperial College Press|edition=The Berkeley Lectures on Energy - Vol. 1}}</ref>\n\n=== Subsurface monitoring ===\nIn subsurface monitoring, there are direct and indirect methods to determine the amount of {{co2}} in the reservoir. A direct method would be drilling deep enough to collect a fluid sample. This drilling can be difficult and expensive due to the physical properties of the rock. It also only provides data at a specific location. Indirect methods would be to send sound or electromagnetic waves down to the reservoir where it is then reflected back up to be interpreted. This approach is also expensive but it provides data over a much larger region; it does however lack precision. Both direct and indirect monitoring can be done intermittently or continuously.<ref name=\"main\" />\n\n=== Seismic monitoring ===\n[[Seismometer|Seismic monitoring]] is a type of indirect subsurface monitoring. It is done by creating vibrational waves either at the surface using a [[Seismic vibrator|vibroseis truck]], or inside a well using [[Rotating unbalance|spinning eccentric mass]].  These vibrational waves then propagate through the geological layers and reflect back creating patterns that are read and interpreted by seismometers.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Biondi|first1=Biondo|last2=de Ridder|first2=Sjoerd|last3=Chang|first3=Jason|title=Continuous passive - seismic monitoring of CO2 geologic sequestration projects|date=2013|url=https://gcep.stanford.edu/pdfs/TechReports2013/5.2_Biondi_Public_Version_2013.pdf|accessdate=6 May 2016}}</ref> It can identify migration pathways of the {{co2}} plume.<ref>{{cite web|title=Review of Offshore Monitoring for CCS Projects|url=http://ieaghg.org/member/49-publications/technical-reports/590-2015-02-review-of-offshore-monitoring-for-ccs-projects|website=IEAGHG|publisher=IEA Greenhouse Gas R&D Programme|accessdate=6 May 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160603062639/http://ieaghg.org/member/49-publications/technical-reports/590-2015-02-review-of-offshore-monitoring-for-ccs-projects|archive-date=3 June 2016|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Two examples of monitoring geological sequestration sites using seismic monitoring are the [[Sleipner gas field|Sleipner sequestration project]] and the Frio {{co2}} Injection test.

It involves measuring {{co2}} concentrations as well as vertical wind velocities using an anemometer.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Madsen|first1=Rod|last2=Xu|first2=Liukang|last3=Claassen|first3=Brent|last4=McDermitt|first4=Dayle|title=Surface Monitoring Method for Carbon Capture and Storage Projects|journal=Energy Procedia|date=February 2009|volume=1|issue=1|pages=2161\u20132168|doi=10.1016/j.egypro.2009.01.281}}</ref> This provides a measure of the total vertical flux of {{co2}}. Eddy covariance towers could potentially detect leaks, however, the natural carbon cycle, such as photosynthesis and the respiration of plants, would have to be accounted for and a baseline {{co2}} cycle would have to be developed for the location of monitoring. An example of Eddy covariance techniques used to monitor carbon sequestration sites is the [http://escholarship.org/uc/item/397007sh Shallow Release test]. Another similar approach is utilizing accumulation chambers. These chambers are sealed to the ground with an inlet and outlet flow stream connected to a gas analyzer.<ref name=\"main\" /> This also measures the vertical flux of {{co2}}. The disadvantage of accumulation chambers is its inability to monitor a large region which is necessary in detecting {{co2}} leaks over the entire sequestration site.\n\n=== InSAR monitoring ===\n[[InSAR]] monitoring is another type of surface monitoring. It involves a satellite sending signals down to the Earth's surface where it is reflected back to the satellite's receiver. From this, the satellite is able to measure the distance to that point.<ref name=insar>{{cite web|title=InSAR\u2014Satellite-based technique captures overall deformation \"picture\"|url=https://volcanoes.usgs.gov/vhp/insar.html|website=USGS Science for a Changing World|publisher=US Geological Survey|accessdate=6 May 2016}}</ref> In CCS, the injection of {{co2}} in deep sublayers of geological sites creates high pressures. These high pressured, fluid filled layers affect those above and below it resulting in a change of the surface landscape. In areas of stored {{co2}}, the ground's surface often rises due to the high pressures originating in the deep subsurface layers.

Bio CCS Algal Synthesis test facilities were being trialed {{Explain|date=February 2019|reason=What was the result of the trial?}} at Australia's three largest coal-fired power stations (Tarong, Queensland; Eraring, NSW; Loy Yang, Victoria) using piped pre-emission smokestack {{CO2}} (and other greenhouse gases) as feedstock to grow oil-rich algal biomass in enclosed membranes for the production of plastics, transport fuel and nutritious animal feed.\n\nAnother potentially useful way of dealing with industrial sources of {{co2}} is to convert it into hydrocarbons where it can be stored or reused as fuel or to make plastics. There are a number of projects investigating this possibility.<ref name='newsci2645'>New Scientist No2645, 1 March 2008.</ref> For instance, several [[Carbon dioxide scrubber|Carbon dioxide scrubbing]] variants based on [[potassium carbonate]] allow capture of carbon dioxide which can later be used to create liquid fuels, even though this process requires a substantial energy input.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/02/19/science/19carb.html?_r=1 | work=The New York Times | title=Scientists Would Turn Greenhouse Gas Into Gasoline | first=Kenneth | last=Chang | date=2008-02-19 | accessdate=2010-04-03}}</ref> The creation of fuel from atmospheric {{co2}} does not result in [[carbon dioxide removal]] as carbon dioxide is re-released when the fuel is burned. For this reason, synfuels do not represent a [[climate engineering]] technique, but still represent a potentially useful source of net-zero-carbon fuel.\n\nOther uses are the production of stable carbonates from silicates (e.g. [[olivine]] produces [[magnesium carbonate]]).

The [[Fischer-Tropsch process]] can then be used to convert the CO into hydrocarbons. The required temperature can be achieved by using a chamber containing a mirror to focus sunlight on the gas.

Firstly, the increased energy requirements of capturing and compressing {{co2}} significantly raises the operating costs of CCS-equipped power plants. In addition, there are added investment and capital costs. The process would increase the fuel requirement of a plant with CCS by about 15% for a gas-fired plant.<ref name='IPCC_CC'/>  The cost of this extra fuel, as well as storage and other system costs, are estimated to increase the costs of energy from a power plant with CCS by 30\u201360%, depending on the specific circumstances. Pre-commercial CCS demonstration projects are likely to be more expensive than mature CCS technology; the total additional costs of an early large-scale CCS demonstration project are estimated to be \u20ac0.5\u20131.1 billion per project over the project lifetime. Other applications are possible.

Geological storage in saline formations or depleted oil or gas fields typically cost US$0.50\u20138.00 per tonne of {{co2}} injected, plus an additional US$0.10\u20130.30 for monitoring costs. When storage is combined with [[enhanced oil recovery]] to extract extra oil from an oil field, however, the storage could yield net benefits of US$10\u201316 per tonne of {{co2}} injected (based on 2003 oil prices).

Generally, environmental effects from use of CCS arise during power production, {{co2}} capture, transport, and storage. Issues relating to storage are discussed in those sections.\n\nAdditional energy is required for {{co2}} capture, and this means that substantially more fuel has to be used to produce the same amount of power, depending on the plant type. For new super-critical pulverized coal (PC) plants using current technology, the extra energy requirements range from 24 to 40%, while for natural gas combined cycle (NGCC) plants the range is 11\u201322% and for coal-based gasification combined cycle (IGCC) systems it is 14\u201325% [IPCC, 2005].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ipcc.ch/pdf/special-reports/srccs/srccs_technicalsummary.pdf |title=IPCC Special Report: Carbon Capture and Storage Technical Summary.

Plants equipped with [[flue-gas desulfurization]] (FGD) systems for [[sulfur dioxide]] control require proportionally greater amounts of [[limestone]], and systems equipped with [[selective catalytic reduction]] systems for [[NOx|nitrogen oxides produced during combustion]] require proportionally greater amounts of [[ammonia]].\n\nIPCC has provided estimates of air emissions from various CCS plant designs (see table below). While {{co2}} is drastically reduced though never completely captured, emissions of air pollutants increase significantly, generally due to the energy penalty of capture. Hence, the use of CCS entails a reduction in air quality. Type and amount of air pollutants still depends on technology. {{CO2}} is captured with alkaline solvents catching the acidic {{CO2}} at low temperatures in the absorber and releasing {{CO2}} at higher temperatures in a desorber.

To limit the resulting flame temperatures to levels common during conventional combustion, cooled flue gas is recirculated and injected into the combustion chamber. The flue gas consists of mainly carbon dioxide and water vapour, the latter of which is condensed through cooling. The result is an almost pure carbon dioxide stream that can be transported to the sequestration site and stored. Power plant processes based on oxyfuel combustion are sometimes referred to as \"zero emission\" cycles, because the {{co2}} stored is not a fraction removed from the flue gas stream (as in the cases of pre- and post-combustion capture) but the flue gas stream itself. A certain fraction of the {{co2}} generated during combustion will inevitably end up in the condensed water. To warrant the label \"zero emission\" the water would thus have to be treated or disposed of appropriately.\n\n=== {{co2}} separation technologies ===\n\nCarbon dioxide can be separated out of air or flue gas with [[absorption (chemistry)|absorption]], [[adsorption]], or [[membrane gas separation]] technologies. Absorption, or [[carbon dioxide scrubber|carbon scrubbing]], with [[amines]] is the dominant capture technology.\n\nCarbon dioxide adsorbs to a MOF ([[Metal\u2013organic framework]]) through [[physisorption]] or [[chemisorption]] based on the porosity and [[Sensitivity and specificity|selectivity]] of the MOF leaving behind a [[Greenhouse gas]] poor gas stream that is more environmentally friendly.

[[Oil field]]s, [[gas field]]s, saline formations, unmineable [[coal seam]]s, and saline-filled basalt formations have been suggested as storage sites.

The technical feasibility, however, depends on the permeability of the coal bed. In the process of absorption the coal releases previously absorbed [[methane]], and the methane can be recovered ([[enhanced coal bed methane recovery]]). The sale of the methane can be used to offset a portion of the cost of the {{co2}} storage. Burning the resultant methane, however, would negate some of the benefit of sequestering the original {{co2}}.\n\nSaline formations contain highly mineralized brines, and have so far been considered of no benefit to humans. Saline aquifers have been used for storage of chemical waste in a few cases. The main advantage of saline aquifers is their large potential storage volume and their common occurrence. The major disadvantage of saline aquifers is that relatively little is known about them, especially compared to oil fields. To keep the cost of storage acceptable, the geophysical exploration may be limited, resulting in larger uncertainty about the aquifer structure. Unlike storage in oil fields or coal beds, no side product will offset the storage cost.

Leakage due to injection at improper locations or conditions could result in carbon dioxide being released back into the atmosphere. It is important to be able to detect leaks with enough warning to put a stop to it, and to be able to quantify the amount of carbon that has leaked for purposes such as [[cap and trade]] policies, evaluation of environmental impact of leaked carbon, as well as accounting for the total loss and cost of the process. To quantify the amount of carbon dioxide released, should a leak occur, or to closely watch stored {{co2}}, there are several monitoring methods that can be done at both the surface and subsurface levels.<ref name=main>{{cite book|last1=Smit|first1=Berend|last2=Reimer|first2=Jeffery A.|last3=Oldenburg|first3=Curtis M.|last4=Bourg|first4=Ian C.|title=Introduction to Carbon Capture and Sequestration|publisher=Imperial College Press|edition=The Berkeley Lectures on Energy - Vol. 1}}</ref>\n\n=== Subsurface monitoring ===\nIn subsurface monitoring, there are direct and indirect methods to determine the amount of {{co2}} in the reservoir. A direct method would be drilling deep enough to collect a fluid sample. This drilling can be difficult and expensive due to the physical properties of the rock. It also only provides data at a specific location. Indirect methods would be to send sound or electromagnetic waves down to the reservoir where it is then reflected back up to be interpreted. This approach is also expensive but it provides data over a much larger region; it does however lack precision. Both direct and indirect monitoring can be done intermittently or continuously.<ref name=\"main\" />\n\n=== Seismic monitoring ===\n[[Seismometer|Seismic monitoring]] is a type of indirect subsurface monitoring. It is done by creating vibrational waves either at the surface using a [[Seismic vibrator|vibroseis truck]], or inside a well using [[Rotating unbalance|spinning eccentric mass]].  These vibrational waves then propagate through the geological layers and reflect back creating patterns that are read and interpreted by seismometers.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Biondi|first1=Biondo|last2=de Ridder|first2=Sjoerd|last3=Chang|first3=Jason|title=Continuous passive - seismic monitoring of CO2 geologic sequestration projects|date=2013|url=https://gcep.stanford.edu/pdfs/TechReports2013/5.2_Biondi_Public_Version_2013.pdf|accessdate=6 May 2016}}</ref> It can identify migration pathways of the {{co2}} plume.<ref>{{cite web|title=Review of Offshore Monitoring for CCS Projects|url=http://ieaghg.org/member/49-publications/technical-reports/590-2015-02-review-of-offshore-monitoring-for-ccs-projects|website=IEAGHG|publisher=IEA Greenhouse Gas R&D Programme|accessdate=6 May 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160603062639/http://ieaghg.org/member/49-publications/technical-reports/590-2015-02-review-of-offshore-monitoring-for-ccs-projects|archive-date=3 June 2016|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Two examples of monitoring geological sequestration sites using seismic monitoring are the [[Sleipner gas field|Sleipner sequestration project]] and the Frio {{co2}} Injection test. Although this method can confirm the presence of {{co2}} in a given region, it cannot determine the specifics of the environment or concentration of {{co2}}.\n\n=== Surface monitoring ===\n\n[[Eddy covariance]] is a surface monitoring technique that measures the flux of {{co2}} from the ground's surface. It involves measuring {{co2}} concentrations as well as vertical wind velocities using an anemometer.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Madsen|first1=Rod|last2=Xu|first2=Liukang|last3=Claassen|first3=Brent|last4=McDermitt|first4=Dayle|title=Surface Monitoring Method for Carbon Capture and Storage Projects|journal=Energy Procedia|date=February 2009|volume=1|issue=1|pages=2161\u20132168|doi=10.1016/j.egypro.2009.01.281}}</ref> This provides a measure of the total vertical flux of {{co2}}. Eddy covariance towers could potentially detect leaks, however, the natural carbon cycle, such as photosynthesis and the respiration of plants, would have to be accounted for and a baseline {{co2}} cycle would have to be developed for the location of monitoring. An example of Eddy covariance techniques used to monitor carbon sequestration sites is the [http://escholarship.org/uc/item/397007sh Shallow Release test]. Another similar approach is utilizing accumulation chambers. These chambers are sealed to the ground with an inlet and outlet flow stream connected to a gas analyzer.<ref name=\"main\" /> This also measures the vertical flux of {{co2}}. The disadvantage of accumulation chambers is its inability to monitor a large region which is necessary in detecting {{co2}} leaks over the entire sequestration site.\n\n=== InSAR monitoring ===\n[[InSAR]] monitoring is another type of surface monitoring. It involves a satellite sending signals down to the Earth's surface where it is reflected back to the satellite's receiver. From this, the satellite is able to measure the distance to that point.<ref name=insar>{{cite web|title=InSAR\u2014Satellite-based technique captures overall deformation \"picture\"|url=https://volcanoes.usgs.gov/vhp/insar.html|website=USGS Science for a Changing World|publisher=US Geological Survey|accessdate=6 May 2016}}</ref> In CCS, the injection of {{co2}} in deep sublayers of geological sites creates high pressures. These high pressured, fluid filled layers affect those above and below it resulting in a change of the surface landscape. In areas of stored {{co2}}, the ground's surface often rises due to the high pressures originating in the deep subsurface layers. These changes in elevation of the Earth's surface corresponds to a change in the distance from the inSAR satellite which is then detectable and measurable.<ref name=\"insar\" />\n\n== Carbon capture and utilization (CCU) ==\n{{Main|Carbon capture and utilization}}\n\nCarbon Capture and Utilization (CCU) differs from CCS as CCU does not result in geological storage of carbon dioxide.

The Bio CCS Algal Synthesis process is based on earth science photosynthesis: the technology is entirely retrofittable and collocated with the emitter, and the capital outlays may offer a return upon investment due to the high value commodities produced (oil for plastics, fuel and feed). Bio CCS Algal Synthesis test facilities were being trialed {{Explain|date=February 2019|reason=What was the result of the trial?}} at Australia's three largest coal-fired power stations (Tarong, Queensland; Eraring, NSW; Loy Yang, Victoria) using piped pre-emission smokestack {{CO2}} (and other greenhouse gases) as feedstock to grow oil-rich algal biomass in enclosed membranes for the production of plastics, transport fuel and nutritious animal feed.\n\nAnother potentially useful way of dealing with industrial sources of {{co2}} is to convert it into hydrocarbons where it can be stored or reused as fuel or to make plastics. There are a number of projects investigating this possibility.<ref name='newsci2645'>New Scientist No2645, 1 March 2008.</ref> For instance, several [[Carbon dioxide scrubber|Carbon dioxide scrubbing]] variants based on [[potassium carbonate]] allow capture of carbon dioxide which can later be used to create liquid fuels, even though this process requires a substantial energy input.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/02/19/science/19carb.html?_r=1 | work=The New York Times | title=Scientists Would Turn Greenhouse Gas Into Gasoline | first=Kenneth | last=Chang | date=2008-02-19 | accessdate=2010-04-03}}</ref> The creation of fuel from atmospheric {{co2}} does not result in [[carbon dioxide removal]] as carbon dioxide is re-released when the fuel is burned. For this reason, synfuels do not represent a [[climate engineering]] technique, but still represent a potentially useful source of net-zero-carbon fuel.\n\nOther uses are the production of stable carbonates from silicates (e.g. [[olivine]] produces [[magnesium carbonate]]).

Firstly, the increased energy requirements of capturing and compressing {{co2}} significantly raises the operating costs of CCS-equipped power plants. In addition, there are added investment and capital costs. The process would increase the fuel requirement of a plant with CCS by about 15% for a gas-fired plant.<ref name='IPCC_CC'/>  The cost of this extra fuel, as well as storage and other system costs, are estimated to increase the costs of energy from a power plant with CCS by 30\u201360%, depending on the specific circumstances. Pre-commercial CCS demonstration projects are likely to be more expensive than mature CCS technology; the total additional costs of an early large-scale CCS demonstration project are estimated to be \u20ac0.5\u20131.1 billion per project over the project lifetime. Other applications are possible. CCS was trialled for coal-fired plants in the early 21st century but was found to be economically unviable in most countries<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.euractiv.com/section/climate-strategy-2050/news/new-gas-possibilities-in-focus-as-commission-prepares-decarbonisation-strategy/|title='We need this dinosaur': EU lifts veil on gas decarbonisation strategy|last=Keating|first=Dave|date=2019-09-18|website=euractiv.com|language=en-GB|access-date=2019-09-27}}</ref> (as of 2019 trials are still ongoing in China but face transport and storage logistical challenges<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ifri.org/en/publications/etudes-de-lifri/carbon-capture-storage-and-utilization-rescue-coal-global-perspectives|title=Carbon Capture, Storage and Utilization to the Rescue of Coal?

Geological storage in saline formations or depleted oil or gas fields typically cost US$0.50\u20138.00 per tonne of {{co2}} injected, plus an additional US$0.10\u20130.30 for monitoring costs. When storage is combined with [[enhanced oil recovery]] to extract extra oil from an oil field, however, the storage could yield net benefits of US$10\u201316 per tonne of {{co2}} injected (based on 2003 oil prices). This would likely negate some of the effect of the carbon capture when the oil was burnt as fuel. \n\nCost of electricity generated by different sources including those incorporating CCS technologies can be found in [[cost of electricity by source]].\n\nIf {{co2}} capture was part of a fuel cycle then the {{co2}} would have value rather than be a cost.

Generally, environmental effects from use of CCS arise during power production, {{co2}} capture, transport, and storage. Issues relating to storage are discussed in those sections.\n\nAdditional energy is required for {{co2}} capture, and this means that substantially more fuel has to be used to produce the same amount of power, depending on the plant type. For new super-critical pulverized coal (PC) plants using current technology, the extra energy requirements range from 24 to 40%, while for natural gas combined cycle (NGCC) plants the range is 11\u201322% and for coal-based gasification combined cycle (IGCC) systems it is 14\u201325% [IPCC, 2005].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ipcc.ch/pdf/special-reports/srccs/srccs_technicalsummary.pdf |title=IPCC Special Report: Carbon Capture and Storage Technical Summary.

Plants equipped with [[flue-gas desulfurization]] (FGD) systems for [[sulfur dioxide]] control require proportionally greater amounts of [[limestone]], and systems equipped with [[selective catalytic reduction]] systems for [[NOx|nitrogen oxides produced during combustion]] require proportionally greater amounts of [[ammonia]].\n\nIPCC has provided estimates of air emissions from various CCS plant designs (see table below). While {{co2}} is drastically reduced though never completely captured, emissions of air pollutants increase significantly, generally due to the energy penalty of capture. Hence, the use of CCS entails a reduction in air quality. Type and amount of air pollutants still depends on technology. {{CO2}} is captured with alkaline solvents catching the acidic {{CO2}} at low temperatures in the absorber and releasing {{CO2}} at higher temperatures in a desorber. Chilled Ammonia CCS Plants have inevitable ammonia emissions to air. \"Functionalized Ammonia\" emit less ammonia, but amines may form secondary amines and these will emit volatile nitrosamines<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ekopolitan.com/news/ccs-norway-amines-nitrosamines-and-nitramines-released-carbon-capture-proce|title=CCS - Norway: Amines, nitrosamines and nitramines released in Carbon Capture Processes should not exceed 0.3 ng/m3 air (The Norwegian Institute of Public Health) - ekopolitan|website=www.ekopolitan.com|access-date=2012-12-19|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923234730/http://www.ekopolitan.com/news/ccs-norway-amines-nitrosamines-and-nitramines-released-carbon-capture-proce|archive-date=2015-09-23|url-status=dead}}</ref> by a side reaction with nitrogendioxide, which is present in any flue gas even after DeNOx. Nevertheless, there are advanced amines in testing with little to no vapor pressure to avoid these amine- and consecutive nitrosamine emissions. Nevertheless, all the capture plants amines have in common, that practically 100% of remaining sulfur dioxide from the plant is washed out of the flue gas, the same applies to dust/ash.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Emissions to air from plants with CCS (kg/MWh)\n|- style=\"background:#ececec;\"\n|  || '''Natural gas combined cycle''' || '''Pulverized coal'''|| '''Integrated gasification combined cycle'''\n|-\n| {{co2}} || 0.43 (\u221289%) || 1.07 (\u221287%) || 0.97 (\u221288%)\n|-\n| NO<sub>X</sub> || 0.11 (+22%) || 0.77 (+31%) || 0.1 (+11%)\n|-\n| SO<sub>X</sub> || \u2014 || 0.001 (\u221299.7%)|| 0.33 (+17.9%)\n|-\n| Ammonia || 0.002 (before: 0) || 0.23 (+2200%) || \u2014\n|-\n| class=\"tNote\" colspan=\"7\" | Based on Table 3.5 in [IPCC, 2005].
