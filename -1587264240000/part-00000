Its average elevation is around 5 meters.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://travelingluck.com/Asia/Sri%20Lanka/North%20Eastern/_6301062_Batticaloa.html#local_map/|title=Batticaloa / Batticaloa, North Eastern, Sri Lanka, Asia|publisher=}}</ref> Batticaloa district has three lagoons such as [[Batticaloa Lagoon]], Valaichchenai Lagoon, and Vakari (Panichchankerni) Lagoon. Among these lagoon, Batticaloa Lagoon is the largest lagoon and has 56&nbsp;km long 162 square km area, extending from Pankudaweli in North and Kalmunai in South.\n\nThere are several islands within the Batticaloa Lagoon such as Puliayantheevu, Buffaloa Island and Bone Island.\nMany bridges are built across the lagoon connecting the landmasses and the islands. The Puliayantheevu is the metropolitan place of the city.\nThe biggest bridge of all is Lady Manning bridge located at Kallady, which is the main access path to the city from the southern places of the district. This bridge is also famous for Singing fishes which were considered as musical sounds heard in the Kallady lagoon on a full moon day. A priest named Father Lang recorded this musical charm and broadcast it in the 1960s over the (Sri Lanka Broadcasting Cooperation)\n\nBatticaloa beaches are sandy and located along 4&nbsp;km shoreline in the city and further extend through the neighboring places. They include Kallady beach, Pasikudah, and Kalkudah. Pasikudah is a bay protected from the ocean, with a flat and sandy bed extending 150 to 200 meters from the shore.\n\n=== Climate ===\nBatticaloa has a [[tropical wet and dry climate]] under the [[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]], also generically referred to as 'dry-monsoonal climate'. Batticaloa's climate is temperate throughout the year. From March to May, the warmest time of the year, the maximum temperature averages around 32 degrees Celsius (88 [[Fahrenheit|degrees Fahrenheit]]). During the monsoon season from November to February heavy rains are recorded, with average temperature of 25&nbsp;\u00b0C.

They immigrated their people from India and established the kingdom of Mukkuva. The name of the villages and towns in Batticaloa still holds the historical evidence of the ancient batticaloan people. When Mutkuhar intruded through the salty water and reached the destination of their voyage at the forests situated around the lagoon. When they finished. The name given by the Mukkuva was \"Kallpu-Mattam\" which literally means \"boundary of lagoon\".

Mukkuvas waged war around Puttalam and settled in the western coast as well. Sinhala Kings of [[Kuru Kingdom|Suryawamsa]] kept Mukkuvas as their mercenary force.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}} They waged wars on other countries like Burma. Gajabahu, Parakramabahu, Vijayabahu were some of these [[Kuru Kingdom|Suryawamsa]] kings who employed the Chera soldiers for their protection and defence of Sri Lanka. [[Gajabahu I]] was a friend of Cheran [[Senguttuvan|Chenkuttuvan]] and was mentioned in the great Jain epic of [[Silappadikaram]] and in addition to that he was also mentioned in Mahawamsa.\n\nWhen Anuradhapura was destroyed, the capital moved from Anuradhapura to [[Polonnaruwa]]. When Pollonaruwa was destroyed the capital moved to Kotte and then to Kandy. Anuradhapura was destroyed by [[Rajaraja Cholan]] and he who established Polonnaruwa. Even though Pollonaruwa had a few Hindu temples it was a great Buddhist city full of beautiful Buddhist architecture matching [[Angkor Wat]].\n\n=== Kalinga Magha ===\n{{Main|Kalinga Magha}}\n\nAs a catalyst for change, [[Kalinga Magha]] is arguably one of the most significant rulers in Sri Lankan history. His invasion marks the final \u2013 cataclysmic \u2013 destruction of the kingdom of Rajarata, which had for so long been the heart of native power on the island. The great cities of the ancient kings were now lost and disappeared into the jungle, and were not rediscovered until the 19th century. Native power was henceforth centred on a kaleidoscopically shifting collection of kingdoms in south and central Sri Lanka. The north, in the meanwhile, eventually evolved into the [[Jaffna Kingdom]], which was subjected colonial rule by the Portuguese in 1619.\n\n[[Kalinga Magha]]'s geopolitical impact is reflected in the changing language of the [[Culavamsa]] as well. The traditional divisions of Sri Lanka, into Rajarata, Dhakkinadesa, and Ruhuna, first undergo a change of names (Rajarata becomes Pathithadesa, Dhakkinadesa becomes Mayarata), and then slip into obsolescence altogether. Their successor kingdoms tended to be geographically smaller and centred on a strong citadel-capital, such as Yapahuwa or Gampola; they also tended to be much short lived, like Sitawaka.\n\n=== Jaffna principality ===\n{{Main|Jaffna kingdom}}\n\nWith the decline of the Rohana sub-kingdom and the defeat of [[Polonnaruwa]], coming with the rise of [[Chola]] power, i.e., from about the 13th century CE, these regions became wild. The many irrigation works (tanks etc., which exist even today) became home to malaria (see [[History of Sri Lanka]]). In the meantime, the eastern coastal region remained less affected by Malaria and began to be occupied. Thus seafaring people who had begun to settle down along\nthe coast since the [[Anuradhapura]] times, c. 6th Century CE began to flourish. The forests continued to be dominated by the [[Veddha]] population which claimed kingship (\"cross-cousins\") with the Sinhala kings of Kandy.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://vedda.org/obeyesekere3.htm|title=V\u00e4dda Heterogenity and Historic Complexity|first=Gananath|last=Obeyesekere|access-date=2007-11-07|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071203113219/http://vedda.org/obeyesekere3.htm|archive-date=2007-12-03|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n[[Parakramabahu]]'s coronation took place in 1236. He turned his attention to the recovery of Polonnaruwa from the Tamils, and achieved this purpose by 1244. In this connection two kings are mentioned, [[Kalinga Magha]] and [[Jaya Bahu]], who had been in power forty years, apparently reckoned from the time of the military rule after [[Sahasa Malla]]. As the Tamil war' and the `Malala war' as specifically mentioned by contemporary chronicles the two kings may have held different parts of the country. In the king's eleventh year (1244/5) Lanka was invaded by [[Chandrabhanu]], a [[Java]]nese (Javaka) from [[Tambralinga]], with a host armed with blow-pipes and poisoned arrows: he may have been a sea-robber, and though now repulsed descended on the Island later on.\n\nThe rest of the reign according to the contemporary records was spent in pious works; the king also held a convocation for the purpose of reforming the priesthood, whose discipline had been relaxed during the Tamil occupation. The chronicles make no mention of a great [[Pandyan]] invasion which seems to have taken place between 1254 and 1256, in which one of the kings of Lanka was slain and the other rendered tributary. From this it is clear that [[Parakramabahu]] never had recovered the north of the Island, which certainly had been held by his great namesake.\n\n=== European colony ===\n{{Main|Batticaloa Territory}}\n\n'''Portugal'''\n{{Main|Portuguese Ceylon}}\n[[File:growth of sitawaka final.png|thumb|left|The growth and impact of the kingdom of Sitawaka, 1521\u20131594]]\n[[Louren\u00e7o de Almeida]], the Portuguese Admiral for India invaded Ceylon and made it a Portuguese colony.

As the Portuguese colonisers were dividing and ruling [[Kotte]], [[Kandy Kingdom]] and [[Jaffna Kingdom]] had to create a confederacy to fight against Portugal. As a joint strategy they approached the Netherlands to have a global free trade and to get rid of the Portuguese.\n\nFrom [[Kanyakumari|Cape Comorin]] the Dutch Admiral [[Joris van Spilbergen]] steered his course to [[Galle|Point de Galle]]; but, without landing there or at any of the other places which were strongly fortified by the Portuguese, he sailed round the south coast of the Island and made for Batticaloa, where he anchored on 31 May 1602.\n\n[[File:AMH-6134-NA Bird's eye view of the fort of Batticaloa.jpg|thumb|[[Batticaloa fort]], c. 1665]]\nHe learnt that the town of Batticaloa, where the chief of the province resided, was about {{convert|3|mi|km|0|spell=in}} inland; so he sent him a messenger proposing to enter into trade with him. In the meantime he learnt from some Tamils who came on board that there was plenty of pepper and cinnamon to be had, but that it was to be obtained from the chief of the place. These Tamils brought with them a Portuguese interpreter; for Portuguese was the only European\nlanguage then heard or spoken in Ceylon, and the natives of the island had no idea that there were other white people who spoke a different language.\n\nThe Admiral was taken from Batticaloa to Kandy and was given a liberation hero's welcome as King Rajasinghe seized the opportunity to get rid of the Portuguese, the oppressors who were slowly encroaching the island systematically and promoting subversion against Rajasinghe.\n\nThe [[Batticaloa fort]] was built by the Portuguese in 1628 and was the first to be captured by the Dutch (18 May 1638).

Eastern Province is a place of Amman temples. This shows the worship of female deity [[Kannaki]] of [[Silappatikaram]]. The cult has come with the King [[Gajabahu I]] who brought the settler Tamils from the [[Chera dynasty|Chera]] Kingdom of his friend Cheran [[Senguttuvan]]. Silppatikaram copy was initially discovered in Trincomalee by Tamil scholars. Tamil Nadu was not having a copy of this great Tamil literature. The northern and eastern parts of Sri Lanka have several temples in honour of Kannaki Amman. Gajabahu I brought Amman worship to Sri Lanka in the Third Century AD after her death.\n\nShri Mamangeshwarar Kovil is one of the main holy places for Hindus in the country is located in a place called Amirthakally which is 6 Kilometers away from Batticaloa town. Hindus believe that by bathing in the water of sacred water of Mamangeshwarar tank, the departed souls of their family will be receiving better attainments in their cycle of its transmigration. Sri Kandaswamy/KannakaiAmman Kovil are important from a devotional point of view. The Mandur (\u0bae\u0ba3\u0bcd\u0b9f\u0bc2\u0bb0\u0bcd) temple is in the southern end, while the Mamangeshwarar temple is in the western-most edge at Muhaththuvaram (\u0bae\u0bc1\u0b95\u0ba4\u0bcd\u0ba4\u0bc1\u0bb5\u0bbe\u0bb0\u0bae\u0bcd).\n\nThe Colany Mosque, and the Koddamunai Dharga and Madrasa are two noteworthy Muslim institutions.

Gajabahu, Parakramabahu, Vijayabahu were some of these [[Kuru Kingdom|Suryawamsa]] kings who employed the Chera soldiers for their protection and defence of Sri Lanka. [[Gajabahu I]] was a friend of Cheran [[Senguttuvan|Chenkuttuvan]] and was mentioned in the great Jain epic of [[Silappadikaram]] and in addition to that he was also mentioned in Mahawamsa.\n\nWhen Anuradhapura was destroyed, the capital moved from Anuradhapura to [[Polonnaruwa]]. When Pollonaruwa was destroyed the capital moved to Kotte and then to Kandy. Anuradhapura was destroyed by [[Rajaraja Cholan]] and he who established Polonnaruwa. Even though Pollonaruwa had a few Hindu temples it was a great Buddhist city full of beautiful Buddhist architecture matching [[Angkor Wat]].\n\n=== Kalinga Magha ===\n{{Main|Kalinga Magha}}\n\nAs a catalyst for change, [[Kalinga Magha]] is arguably one of the most significant rulers in Sri Lankan history. His invasion marks the final \u2013 cataclysmic \u2013 destruction of the kingdom of Rajarata, which had for so long been the heart of native power on the island. The great cities of the ancient kings were now lost and disappeared into the jungle, and were not rediscovered until the 19th century. Native power was henceforth centred on a kaleidoscopically shifting collection of kingdoms in south and central Sri Lanka. The north, in the meanwhile, eventually evolved into the [[Jaffna Kingdom]], which was subjected colonial rule by the Portuguese in 1619.\n\n[[Kalinga Magha]]'s geopolitical impact is reflected in the changing language of the [[Culavamsa]] as well. The traditional divisions of Sri Lanka, into Rajarata, Dhakkinadesa, and Ruhuna, first undergo a change of names (Rajarata becomes Pathithadesa, Dhakkinadesa becomes Mayarata), and then slip into obsolescence altogether. Their successor kingdoms tended to be geographically smaller and centred on a strong citadel-capital, such as Yapahuwa or Gampola; they also tended to be much short lived, like Sitawaka.\n\n=== Jaffna principality ===\n{{Main|Jaffna kingdom}}\n\nWith the decline of the Rohana sub-kingdom and the defeat of [[Polonnaruwa]], coming with the rise of [[Chola]] power, i.e., from about the 13th century CE, these regions became wild. The many irrigation works (tanks etc., which exist even today) became home to malaria (see [[History of Sri Lanka]]). In the meantime, the eastern coastal region remained less affected by Malaria and began to be occupied. Thus seafaring people who had begun to settle down along\nthe coast since the [[Anuradhapura]] times, c. 6th Century CE began to flourish. The forests continued to be dominated by the [[Veddha]] population which claimed kingship (\"cross-cousins\") with the Sinhala kings of Kandy.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://vedda.org/obeyesekere3.htm|title=V\u00e4dda Heterogenity and Historic Complexity|first=Gananath|last=Obeyesekere|access-date=2007-11-07|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071203113219/http://vedda.org/obeyesekere3.htm|archive-date=2007-12-03|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n[[Parakramabahu]]'s coronation took place in 1236. He turned his attention to the recovery of Polonnaruwa from the Tamils, and achieved this purpose by 1244. In this connection two kings are mentioned, [[Kalinga Magha]] and [[Jaya Bahu]], who had been in power forty years, apparently reckoned from the time of the military rule after [[Sahasa Malla]]. As the Tamil war' and the `Malala war' as specifically mentioned by contemporary chronicles the two kings may have held different parts of the country. In the king's eleventh year (1244/5) Lanka was invaded by [[Chandrabhanu]], a [[Java]]nese (Javaka) from [[Tambralinga]], with a host armed with blow-pipes and poisoned arrows: he may have been a sea-robber, and though now repulsed descended on the Island later on.\n\nThe rest of the reign according to the contemporary records was spent in pious works; the king also held a convocation for the purpose of reforming the priesthood, whose discipline had been relaxed during the Tamil occupation. The chronicles make no mention of a great [[Pandyan]] invasion which seems to have taken place between 1254 and 1256, in which one of the kings of Lanka was slain and the other rendered tributary. From this it is clear that [[Parakramabahu]] never had recovered the north of the Island, which certainly had been held by his great namesake.\n\n=== European colony ===\n{{Main|Batticaloa Territory}}\n\n'''Portugal'''\n{{Main|Portuguese Ceylon}}\n[[File:growth of sitawaka final.png|thumb|left|The growth and impact of the kingdom of Sitawaka, 1521\u20131594]]\n[[Louren\u00e7o de Almeida]], the Portuguese Admiral for India invaded Ceylon and made it a Portuguese colony.

As the Portuguese colonisers were dividing and ruling [[Kotte]], [[Kandy Kingdom]] and [[Jaffna Kingdom]] had to create a confederacy to fight against Portugal. As a joint strategy they approached the Netherlands to have a global free trade and to get rid of the Portuguese.\n\nFrom [[Kanyakumari|Cape Comorin]] the Dutch Admiral [[Joris van Spilbergen]] steered his course to [[Galle|Point de Galle]]; but, without landing there or at any of the other places which were strongly fortified by the Portuguese, he sailed round the south coast of the Island and made for Batticaloa, where he anchored on 31 May 1602.\n\n[[File:AMH-6134-NA Bird's eye view of the fort of Batticaloa.jpg|thumb|[[Batticaloa fort]], c. 1665]]\nHe learnt that the town of Batticaloa, where the chief of the province resided, was about {{convert|3|mi|km|0|spell=in}} inland; so he sent him a messenger proposing to enter into trade with him. In the meantime he learnt from some Tamils who came on board that there was plenty of pepper and cinnamon to be had, but that it was to be obtained from the chief of the place. These Tamils brought with them a Portuguese interpreter; for Portuguese was the only European\nlanguage then heard or spoken in Ceylon, and the natives of the island had no idea that there were other white people who spoke a different language.\n\nThe Admiral was taken from Batticaloa to Kandy and was given a liberation hero's welcome as King Rajasinghe seized the opportunity to get rid of the Portuguese, the oppressors who were slowly encroaching the island systematically and promoting subversion against Rajasinghe.\n\nThe [[Batticaloa fort]] was built by the Portuguese in 1628 and was the first to be captured by the Dutch (18 May 1638). It is one of the most picturesque of the small Dutch fort of Sri Lanka, it's situated in an island, still in good condition.\n\n=== World War II ===\n\nIn 1942, during [[World War II]], the aircraft carrier [[HMS Hermes (95)|HMS ''Hermes'']] and escorting destroyer [[HMAS Vampire (D68)|HMAS ''Vampire'']] were stationed at [[Trincomalee]].

Eastern Province is a place of Amman temples. This shows the worship of female deity [[Kannaki]] of [[Silappatikaram]]. The cult has come with the King [[Gajabahu I]] who brought the settler Tamils from the [[Chera dynasty|Chera]] Kingdom of his friend Cheran [[Senguttuvan]]. Silppatikaram copy was initially discovered in Trincomalee by Tamil scholars. Tamil Nadu was not having a copy of this great Tamil literature. The northern and eastern parts of Sri Lanka have several temples in honour of Kannaki Amman. Gajabahu I brought Amman worship to Sri Lanka in the Third Century AD after her death.\n\nShri Mamangeshwarar Kovil is one of the main holy places for Hindus in the country is located in a place called Amirthakally which is 6 Kilometers away from Batticaloa town. Hindus believe that by bathing in the water of sacred water of Mamangeshwarar tank, the departed souls of their family will be receiving better attainments in their cycle of its transmigration. Sri Kandaswamy/KannakaiAmman Kovil are important from a devotional point of view. The Mandur (\u0bae\u0ba3\u0bcd\u0b9f\u0bc2\u0bb0\u0bcd) temple is in the southern end, while the Mamangeshwarar temple is in the western-most edge at Muhaththuvaram (\u0bae\u0bc1\u0b95\u0ba4\u0bcd\u0ba4\u0bc1\u0bb5\u0bbe\u0bb0\u0bae\u0bcd).\n\nThe Colany Mosque, and the Koddamunai Dharga and Madrasa are two noteworthy Muslim institutions. There are a large number of mosques in the region.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.muslimaffairs.gov.lk/list_mosque.php?rightmenue=1&did=4&title=Mosque%20in%20Batticaloa%20District|title=Mosques in the Batti region|access-date=2007-11-07|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080514052204/http://www.muslimaffairs.gov.lk/list_mosque.php?rightmenue=1&did=4&title=Mosque%20in%20Batticaloa%20District|archive-date=2008-05-14|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nChristianity is present and Catholic churches are found every where as the coastal community has some Catholics. During the colonial influences, Catholic was introduced to Batticaloan, and the [[Church of Our Lady of Presentation, Batticaloa|first Catholic church in Batticaloa]] was established in 1624. The [[Catholic Church]] has a [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Batticaloa|diocese]] headquartered in the city.

The lagoon is famous for its \"singing fish,\" supposed to be shell-fish which give forth musical notes. The district has a remnant of Veddahs or wild men of the wood.
