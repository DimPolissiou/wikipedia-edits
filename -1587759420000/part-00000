Another man, Gilbert de Duure, is mentioned in records as \"...having been an outlaw associated with Fulk Fitz Warin\". One other, Eustace de Kivilly, had been pardoned earlier in 1202 by King John for \"being associated with Fulk\".<ref>Meisel, ''Barons of the Welsh Frontier'', p. 38</ref>\n\n===Settlement and status===\nAfter years as an outlaw, on 11 November 1203 Fulk was pardoned, together with over thirty of his followers including his brothers William, Phillip and John, and their cousins. In October 1204, on payment of a fine of 200 marks, Fulk at last received \"right and inheritance\" in Whittington.<ref>A. Kemp-Welch (translator), L.

The suretors included the Peverels, [[Alan Basset]], [[William de Braose (died 1230)]], a de Lacy, [[William Longesp\u00e9e, 3rd Earl of Salisbury]] and [[Henry de Bohun, 1st Earl of Hereford]].<ref>Meisel, ''Barons of the Welsh Frontier'', p. 39</ref> On 9 February 1214, when King John again set sail for [[Poitou]], Fulk was among the barons who accompanied him.

Before the accession of the infant king [[Henry III of England|Henry III]] (John's son) in 1216, Fulk's manor of Alveston had already been seized by the crown: in the following year (1217) all of his other lands in Gloucestershire were likewise seized. By 1218, however, Fulk had made peace and his lands were ordered to be restored to him by the king's regents.<ref>Meisel, ''Barons of the Welsh Frontier'', pp. 41, 43</ref> By 1220 Fulk had regained some favour with the young King Henry III and had been allowed to rebuild and fortify Whittington.<ref>T.D.

Fulk regained it the following year, although his disputes with Llywelyn continued and more of Fulk's lands were seized. By 1228 a truce seems to have been reached between Fulk and Llywelyn following the intervention of the king.<ref>Meisel, ''Barons of the Welsh Frontier'', pp. 41-42</ref><ref>I.J.

As a marcher lord Fulk's role as a protector of the English border against the Welsh was vital to the English King. He arbitrated several border disputes on behalf of the King and although there were more personal disagreements, there were no more rebellions on the part of Fulk III.<ref>Meisel, ''Barons of the Welsh Frontier'', pp. 42, 43, 45</ref>\n\n==Marriages and progeny==\nFulk III FitzWarin married twice:\n*First, in about 1207, to [[Maud le Vavasour, Baroness Butler|Maud le Vavasour]] (d.1226), (''alias'' Matilda), daughter of Robert le Vavasour and widow of the powerful Lancashire baron Theobald Walter.<ref>George Edward Cokayne, The Complete Peerage of England Scotland Ireland Great Britain and the United Kingdom, Extant Extinct or Dormant, ed.

As a young boy, Fulk was sent to the court of King [[Henry II of England|Henry II]] (1154\u20131189), where he grew up with the king's younger son, the future King [[John of England|John]] (1199\u20131216). John became his enemy after a childhood quarrel during a game of chess. As an adult, King John retained his animosity toward Fulk whom he stripped of his ancestral holdings. Fulk thereupon took to the woods as an outlaw and lived a life of adventure. The story may in fact  have confused aspects of the lives of two FitzWarins, Fulk I (d. 1171) and Fulk II (d. 1197), father and son. The romance of Fulk FitzWarin is noted for its parallels to the legend of [[Robin Hood]].<ref>Introduction to ''Fouke le Fitz Waryn'', edited by Stephen Knight and Thomas H.

They included particularly [[Whittington Castle]], held by the Peverels during the reign of King Stephen. Whittington Castle stands on the English side of [[Offa's Dyke]], which before and during the Norman era formed the border between England and [[Wales]].

He was accompanied by approximately fifty-two followers including his brothers William, Phillip and John, by his cousins, and by the family's many tenants and allies in the Marches.<ref name=\"FFWOCH97\"/><ref name=\"Sidney Painter 1964 p. 52\"/>\n\nFulk's rebellion is not related in detail by chroniclers, but it was clearly considerable, for in the spring of 1201, when King John crossed into [[Normandy]] and [[Poitou]] to suppress a revolt by the [[Lusignan dynasty|Lusignans]],<ref>Painter, ''The Reign of King John'', p. 157</ref> he ordered [[Hubert de Burgh, 1st Earl of Kent|Hubert de Burgh]] with 100 knights to counter the rebellion of Fulk and of William Marsh, a [[Somerset]]shire knight who was raiding shipping off the coast of [[Devon]].<ref>Painter, ''The Reign of King John'', pp. 48, 84</ref> In July 1202 Fulk and his men were reported to have taken refuge in [[Stanley Abbey]] in Wiltshire. Another man, Gilbert de Duure, is mentioned in records as \"...having been an outlaw associated with Fulk Fitz Warin\". One other, Eustace de Kivilly, had been pardoned earlier in 1202 by King John for \"being associated with Fulk\".<ref>Meisel, ''Barons of the Welsh Frontier'', p. 38</ref>\n\n===Settlement and status===\nAfter years as an outlaw, on 11 November 1203 Fulk was pardoned, together with over thirty of his followers including his brothers William, Phillip and John, and their cousins. In October 1204, on payment of a fine of 200 marks, Fulk at last received \"right and inheritance\" in Whittington.<ref>A. Kemp-Welch (translator), L.

The suretors included the Peverels, [[Alan Basset]], [[William de Braose (died 1230)]], a de Lacy, [[William Longesp\u00e9e, 3rd Earl of Salisbury]] and [[Henry de Bohun, 1st Earl of Hereford]].<ref>Meisel, ''Barons of the Welsh Frontier'', p. 39</ref> On 9 February 1214, when King John again set sail for [[Poitou]], Fulk was among the barons who accompanied him.

Before the accession of the infant king [[Henry III of England|Henry III]] (John's son) in 1216, Fulk's manor of Alveston had already been seized by the crown: in the following year (1217) all of his other lands in Gloucestershire were likewise seized. By 1218, however, Fulk had made peace and his lands were ordered to be restored to him by the king's regents.<ref>Meisel, ''Barons of the Welsh Frontier'', pp. 41, 43</ref> By 1220 Fulk had regained some favour with the young King Henry III and had been allowed to rebuild and fortify Whittington.<ref>T.D.

Fulk regained it the following year, although his disputes with Llywelyn continued and more of Fulk's lands were seized. By 1228 a truce seems to have been reached between Fulk and Llywelyn following the intervention of the king.<ref>Meisel, ''Barons of the Welsh Frontier'', pp. 41-42</ref><ref>I.J.

As a marcher lord Fulk's role as a protector of the English border against the Welsh was vital to the English King. He arbitrated several border disputes on behalf of the King and although there were more personal disagreements, there were no more rebellions on the part of Fulk III.<ref>Meisel, ''Barons of the Welsh Frontier'', pp. 42, 43, 45</ref>\n\n==Marriages and progeny==\nFulk III FitzWarin married twice:\n*First, in about 1207, to [[Maud le Vavasour, Baroness Butler|Maud le Vavasour]] (d.1226), (''alias'' Matilda), daughter of Robert le Vavasour and widow of the powerful Lancashire baron Theobald Walter.<ref>George Edward Cokayne, The Complete Peerage of England Scotland Ireland Great Britain and the United Kingdom, Extant Extinct or Dormant, ed.

As a young boy, Fulk was sent to the court of King [[Henry II of England|Henry II]] (1154\u20131189), where he grew up with the king's younger son, the future King [[John of England|John]] (1199\u20131216). John became his enemy after a childhood quarrel during a game of chess. As an adult, King John retained his animosity toward Fulk whom he stripped of his ancestral holdings. Fulk thereupon took to the woods as an outlaw and lived a life of adventure. The story may in fact  have confused aspects of the lives of two FitzWarins, Fulk I (d. 1171) and Fulk II (d. 1197), father and son. The romance of Fulk FitzWarin is noted for its parallels to the legend of [[Robin Hood]].<ref>Introduction to ''Fouke le Fitz Waryn'', edited by Stephen Knight and Thomas H.

A fan of [[arcade game]]s, Tajiri wrote for and edited his own video gaming [[fanzine]] ''Game Freak'' with [[Ken Sugimori]], before evolving it into a development company of the same name. Tajiri claims that the joining of two [[Game Boy]]s via a link cable inspired him to create a game which embodied the collection and companionship of his childhood hobby, [[insect collecting]]. The game, which became ''[[Pok\u00e9mon Red]]'' and ''[[Pok\u00e9mon Green]]'', took six years to complete and went on to spark a multibillion-dollar franchise which reinvigorated [[Nintendo]]'s [[Handheld game console|handheld gaming]].

A fan of [[arcade game]]s, Tajiri wrote for and edited his own video gaming [[fanzine]] ''Game Freak'' with [[Ken Sugimori]], before evolving it into a development company of the same name. Tajiri claims that the joining of two [[Game Boy]]s via a link cable inspired him to create a game which embodied the collection and companionship of his childhood hobby, [[insect collecting]]. The game, which became ''[[Pok\u00e9mon Red]]'' and ''[[Pok\u00e9mon Green]]'', took six years to complete and went on to spark a multibillion-dollar franchise which reinvigorated [[Nintendo]]'s [[Handheld game console|handheld gaming]]. Tajiri continued to work as director for the ''Pok\u00e9mon'' series until the development of [[Pok\u00e9mon Ruby and Sapphire|''Pok\u00e9mon Ruby'' and ''Sapphire'']], when he changed his role to simply executive producer.\n\nTajiri has also worked for other projects including ''[[Mario (franchise)|Mario]]'' spin-offs.
