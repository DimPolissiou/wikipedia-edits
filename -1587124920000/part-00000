His plan to found a University at Drogheda failed due to his judicial assassination.\n\n==Political career==\nUpon the death of his father, James FitzGerald, 6th Earl of Desmond, in 1462, Thomas FitzJames FitzGerald, became the 7th Earl of Desmond. That same year Desmond, having sided, as had his father, with the [[House of York]], put down a [[House of Lancaster|Lancastrian]] invasion of Ireland by John and Thomas [[Butler dynasty|Butler]], brothers of the [[Earl of Ormond (Ireland)|Earl of Ormond]].<ref name=Wagner>[https://books.google.com/books?id=ubXnWRMt6uoC&pg=PA94&dq=Thomas+FitzGerald,+7th+Earl+of+Kildare&hl=en&sa=X&ei=_SyhVYucOoOwggSr_abQDQ&ved=0CCoQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&q=Thomas%20FitzGerald%2C%207th%20Earl%20of%20Kildare&f=false Wagner, John A., \"Fitzgerald, Thomas, Earl of Desmond\", ''Encyclopedia of the Wars of the Roses'', ABC-CLIO, 2001] {{ISBN|9781851093588}}</ref> Local memory claims that the [[Battle of Piltown]] was so violent that the local river ran red with blood, hence the names Pill River and Piltown (''Baile an Phuill'' \u2013 Town of the blood). Piltown was the only battle of the [[Wars of the Roses]] fought in Ireland.\n\nIn appreciation, the following year King [[Edward IV of England|Edward IV]] appointed Desmond Lord-Deputy under the  King's brother, [[George Plantagenet, 1st Duke of Clarence|Duke of Clarence]]. Desmond built castles around [[the Pale]], and continued the hereditary feud with the Butlers. In 1464 he founded the collegiate church at [[Youghal]].<ref name=twhf>[https://books.google.com/books?id=r5gxAQAAIAAJ&pg=PA189&lpg=PA189&dq=James+FitzGerald,+6th+Earl+of+Desmond&source=bl&ots=8kT1zpBcjU&sig=rbppT2CZJVkkxMXt4GyhiGKND30&hl=en&sa=X&ei=pqWgVaT1E4LWgwSojIDgCg&ved=0CCMQ6AEwATgy#v=onepage&q=James%20FitzGerald%2C%206th%20Earl%20of%20Desmond&f=false Fitzgerald, Thomas W. H., ''Ireland and her people'', Fitzgerald Book Company, 1910]</ref>\n\n==Downfall and death==\n[[Image:Ireland 1450.png|thumb|150px|Ireland c. 1450, showing the Yorkist earldom of Desmond and its Lancastrian rival earldom of Ormond]]\nIn 1466 he was badly defeated in an expedition to [[Offaly]], which permanently weakened the defence of [[the Pale]].<ref name=Ross>Ross, Charles ''Edward IV'' Eyre and Methuen 1974 p.204</ref> He was well liked in Ireland for his defence of them against the difficulties of English law. The parliament in the Dublin Pale, had a negative view of the Gaels, descendants of the original inhabitants, and passed an act in 1465 that every Irishman dwelling in the Pale was to dress and shave like the English, and take an English surname such as the name of a town, or of a colour such as Black, Brown, Green or White, or of a trade such as Smith, Carpenter, Thatcher, or forfeit his goods. Another measure forbade ships from fishing in the seas off Ireland, because the dues went to make the Irish people prosperous. Another provided that it was lawful to decapitate 'thieves' found robbing \"or going or coming anywhere\" unless they had an Englishman in their company. On bringing the head to the mayor of the nearest town, 'head money' was paid.\n\nDesmond was the main defender of the Irish against such exactions. Following his assassination, in 1468 Edward IV replaced Desmond as Lord Deputy with [[John Tiptoft, 1st Earl of Worcester]], a Crown servant notorious for cruelty and ruthlessness, nicknamed \"the Butcher of England\".\n\nAccused by his political enemies of [[treason]], for aiding the Irish against the King's subjects, as well as [[extortion]], Desmond attended a Parliament held in [[Drogheda]]. He, along with [[Thomas FitzGerald, 7th Earl of Kildare]], was  [[attainted]] for [[treason]]. The fact that Desmond had been seized in a [[Priory]], in breach of the right of [[sanctuary]], caused particular indignation.<ref name=Otway>Otway-Ruthven, A.J. ''A History of Medieval Ireland'' Barnes and Noble reissue 1993 p.392</ref> Desmond was summarily beheaded,<ref name=Ross/> while Kildare managed to escape to England to plead his case before the King. Desmond was buried at St. Peter's Church, Drogheda, then afterwards removed to [[Christ Church Cathedral, Dublin]].\n\nDesmond's death shocked the nation: \"slain by the swords of the wicked, or may I say a martyr\" wrote one chronicler.<ref name=Otway/> Some accounts claim that Tiptoft also murdered two of Desmond's young sons, who were attending school in Drogheda.\nThe Munster Geraldines invaded the Pale. Not wishing to see a similar uprising in [[Leinster]], Edward revoked the attainder against both Kildare and Desmond. Although Desmond's heir was allowed to succeed to his father's lands and title, relations between the Crown and the Desmonds were strained for decades.<ref name=Wagner/>\n\nThe precise cause of his downfall remains something of a mystery.

His plan to found a University at Drogheda failed due to his judicial assassination.\n\n==Political career==\nUpon the death of his father, James FitzGerald, 6th Earl of Desmond, in 1462, Thomas FitzJames FitzGerald, became the 7th Earl of Desmond. That same year Desmond, having sided, as had his father, with the [[House of York]], put down a [[House of Lancaster|Lancastrian]] invasion of Ireland by John and Thomas [[Butler dynasty|Butler]], brothers of the [[Earl of Ormond (Ireland)|Earl of Ormond]].<ref name=Wagner>[https://books.google.com/books?id=ubXnWRMt6uoC&pg=PA94&dq=Thomas+FitzGerald,+7th+Earl+of+Kildare&hl=en&sa=X&ei=_SyhVYucOoOwggSr_abQDQ&ved=0CCoQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&q=Thomas%20FitzGerald%2C%207th%20Earl%20of%20Kildare&f=false Wagner, John A., \"Fitzgerald, Thomas, Earl of Desmond\", ''Encyclopedia of the Wars of the Roses'', ABC-CLIO, 2001] {{ISBN|9781851093588}}</ref> Local memory claims that the [[Battle of Piltown]] was so violent that the local river ran red with blood, hence the names Pill River and Piltown (''Baile an Phuill'' \u2013 Town of the blood). Piltown was the only battle of the [[Wars of the Roses]] fought in Ireland.\n\nIn appreciation, the following year King [[Edward IV of England|Edward IV]] appointed Desmond Lord-Deputy under the [[George Plantagenet, 1st Duke of Clarence|Duke of Clarence]]. Desmond built castles around [[the Pale]], and continued the hereditary feud with the Butlers. In 1464 he founded the collegiate church at [[Youghal]].<ref name=twhf>[https://books.google.com/books?id=r5gxAQAAIAAJ&pg=PA189&lpg=PA189&dq=James+FitzGerald,+6th+Earl+of+Desmond&source=bl&ots=8kT1zpBcjU&sig=rbppT2CZJVkkxMXt4GyhiGKND30&hl=en&sa=X&ei=pqWgVaT1E4LWgwSojIDgCg&ved=0CCMQ6AEwATgy#v=onepage&q=James%20FitzGerald%2C%206th%20Earl%20of%20Desmond&f=false Fitzgerald, Thomas W.

The parliament in the Dublin Pale, had a negative view of the Gaels, descendants of the original inhabitants, and passed an act in 1465 that every Irishman dwelling in the Pale was to dress and shave like the English, and take an English surname such as the name of a town, or of a colour such as Black, Brown, Green or White, or of a trade such as Smith, Carpenter, Thatcher, or forfeit his goods. Another measure forbade ships from fishing in the seas off Ireland, because the dues went to make the Irish people prosperous. Another provided that it was lawful to decapitate 'thieves' found robbing \"or going or coming anywhere\" unless they had an Englishman in their company. On bringing the head to the mayor of the nearest town, 'head money' was paid.\n\nDesmond was the main defender of the Irish against such exactions. Following his assassination, in 1468 Edward IV replaced Desmond as Lord Deputy with [[John Tiptoft, 1st Earl of Worcester]], a Crown servant notorious for cruelty and ruthlessness, nicknamed \"the Butcher of England\".\n\nAccused by his political enemies of [[treason]], for aiding the Irish against the King's subjects, as well as [[extortion]], Desmond attended a Parliament held in [[Drogheda]]. He, along with [[Thomas FitzGerald, 7th Earl of Kildare]], was  [[attainted]] for [[treason]]. The fact that Desmond had been seized in a [[Priory]], in breach of the right of [[sanctuary]], caused particular indignation.<ref name=Otway>Otway-Ruthven, A.J. ''A History of Medieval Ireland'' Barnes and Noble reissue 1993 p.392</ref> Desmond was summarily beheaded,<ref name=Ross/> while Kildare managed to escape to England to plead his case before the King. Desmond was buried at St. Peter's Church, Drogheda, then afterwards removed to [[Christ Church Cathedral, Dublin]].\n\nDesmond's death shocked the nation: \"slain by the swords of the wicked, or may I say a martyr\" wrote one chronicler.<ref name=Otway/> Some accounts claim that Tiptoft also murdered two of Desmond's young sons, who were attending school in Drogheda.\nThe Munster Geraldines invaded the Pale. Not wishing to see a similar uprising in [[Leinster]], Edward revoked the attainder against both Kildare and Desmond. Although Desmond's heir was allowed to succeed to his father's lands and title, relations between the Crown and the Desmonds were strained for decades.<ref name=Wagner/>\n\nThe precise cause of his downfall remains something of a mystery. There were vague rumours that he was involved in  a plot against Tiptoft, who was certainly not a man to give his   enemies the benefit of the doubt, and even vaguer  rumours that Desmond might be planning to become [[King of Ireland]].<ref name=Otway/> Apart from Tiptoft, he had another powerful enemy in [[William Sherwood (bishop)|William Sherwood]], [[Bishop of Meath]], a man as ruthless as Tiptoft himself, who was believed by many to have poisoned Tiptoft's mind against Desmond.

Circumcision was enjoined upon the biblical patriarch [[Abraham]], his descendants and their slaves as \"a token of the covenant\" concluded with him by [[God]] for all generations, an \"everlasting covenant\" ({{Bibleverse||Genesis|17:13|HE}}), thus it is commonly observed by two (Judaism and Islam) of the [[Abrahamic religions]].\n\nThe penalty of non-observance was ''[[kareth]]'' (Hebrew: \"cutting off\") from the people ({{Bibleverse||Genesis|17:10-14|HE}}, {{Bibleverse-nb||Genesis|21:4|HE}}; {{Bibleverse||Lev|12:3|HE}}). Non-Israelites had to undergo circumcision before they could be allowed to take part in the feast of [[Passover]] ({{Bibleverse||Exodus|12:48|HE}}). See also [[Proselyte#Rules for proselytes in the Torah|Mosaic Law directed at non-Jews]] and [[Conversion to Judaism]].\n\nIt was \"a reproach\" for an [[Israelite]] to be uncircumcised ({{Bibleverse||Josh|5:9|HE}}) The name ''arelim'' (uncircumcised) became an opprobrious term, especially a pejorative name for the [[Philistines]], who might have been of [[Greeks|Greek]] origin, in the context of the fierce wars recounted in the [[Book of Samuel]] ({{Bibleverse|1|Sam|14:6|HE}}, {{Bibleverse-nb|1|Sam|31:4|HE}}). When the general (and future king) [[David]] wanted to marry [[King Saul]]'s daughter, the King required a grisly \"[[dowry]]\" of a hundred Philistine [[foreskins]]. David went further: \"and David arose and went, he and his men, and slew of the Philistines two hundred men; and David brought their foreskins, and they gave them in full number to the king, that he might be the king's son-in-law. And Saul gave him Michal his daughter to wife\".({{Bibleverse|1|Sam|18:25|HE}})\n\n\"Uncircumcised\" is used in conjunction with ''tame'' (unpure) for heathen ({{Bibleverse||Isa|52:1|HE}}). The word 'arel' (uncircumcised) is also employed for \"impermeable\" (Lev. 26:41, \"their uncircumcised hearts\"; compare Jer. 9:25; Ezek. xliv. 7, 9); it is also applied to the first three years' fruit of a tree, which is forbidden ({{Bibleverse||Lev|19:23|HE}}). \"The Philistines, more than any other nation, are regularly<ref>Judges 14:3, 15:8, Samuel I 14:6, 17:26,36, 31:14, Samuel II 1:20</ref> called uncircumised\"<ref>Samuel I 13:6 commentary, The Rubin Edition, {{ISBN|1-57819-333-8}}, p. 83</ref> in the [[Hebrew Bible]].\n\nHowever, the Israelites born in the wilderness after [[the exodus]] from Egypt apparently did not carry out the practice of circumcision. According to {{Bibleverse||Josh|5:2-9|HE}}, \"all the people that came out\" of Egypt were circumcised, but those \"born in the wilderness\" were not. In any case, we are told that [[Joshua]], before the celebration of the Passover, had them circumcised at [[Gilgal]].\n\nThe Bible contains several narratives in which circumcision is mentioned. There is the circumcision and massacre of the [[Shechem]]ites ({{Bibleverse||Genesis|34:1-35:5|HE}}), the hundred foreskin dowry ({{Bibleverse|1|Samuel|18:25-27|HE}}) and the story of the Lord threatening to kill Moses, and being placated by Zipporah's circumcision of their son ({{Bibleverse||Exodus|4:24-26|HE}}), and the circumcision at Gilgal of {{Bibleverse||Joshua|5|HE}}.\n\nThere is another sense in which the term \"circumcise\" is used in the Bible. {{Bibleverse||Deut|10:16|HE}} says: \"''Circumcise the foreskin of your heart,''\" (also quoted in {{Bibleverse||Jer|4:4}}, [[New Jewish Publication Society of America Version|New JPS]] translates as: \"Cut away, therefore, the thickening about your hearts\") along with {{Bibleverse||Jer|6:10|HE}}: ''To whom shall I speak, and give warning, that they may hear? behold their ear is uncircumcised, and they cannot hearken: ...'' (New JPS translates: \"Their ears are blocked\"). {{Bibleverse||Jer|9:25-26|HE}} says that circumcised and uncircumcised will be punished alike by the Lord; for \"all the nations are uncircumcised, and all the house of Israel are uncircumcised in heart.\" The New JPS translation adds the note: \"''uncircumcised of heart'': I.e., their minds are blocked to God's commandments.\" Non-Jewish tribes that practiced circumcision were described as being \"circumcised in uncircumcision.\"({{Bibleverse||Jeremiah|9:24|HE}})\n\n===The Intertestamental period===\n{{main|Intertestamental period}}\n\nThe [[deuterocanonical books]] and [[biblical apocrypha]] reveal the cultural clash between Jews and Greeks, and between [[Judaizers]] and [[Hellenistic Judaism|Hellenizers]].<ref name=\"JE\">{{cite web |url=http://jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/4391-circumcision#anchor4 |title=Circumcision: In Apocryphal and Rabbinical Literature |last1=Kohler |first1=Kaufmann |last2=Hirsch |first2=Emil G. |last3=Jacobs |first3=Joseph |last4=Friedenwald |first4=Aaron |last5=Broyd\u00e9 |first5=Isaac |author1-link=Kaufmann Kohler |author2-link=Emil G.

This relatively peaceful period came to an end when [[Antiochus IV Epiphanes]] attacked first Egypt and then sacked and looted Jerusalem ({{Bibleverse|1|Macc|1:16-64|NRSV}}). Epiphanes determined to force everyone to [[Hellenization|live the Greek way]] and abandon the [[Judaizing|Jewish way]]. Among other things, he banned circumcision.<ref name=\"JE\"/><ref name=\"Fredriksen 2018\"/>\n\nAlthough many Hellenized Jews were prepared to conform to Greek culture,<ref name=\"Rubin 1980\"/><ref name=\"Fredriksen 2018\"/> observant Jews saw circumcision as a mark of Jewish loyalty and many who kept to the [[Law of Moses|Mosaic Law]] defied the edict of Antiochus Epiphanes prohibiting circumcision ({{Bibleverse|1|Macc|1:48|NRSV}}, {{Bibleverse-nb|1|Macc|1:60|NRSV}}, and {{Bibleverse-nb|1|Macc|2:46|NRSV}}). Jewish women showed their loyalty to the Law, even at the risk of their lives, by themselves circumcising their sons. \"For example, two women were brought in for having circumcised their children. They publicly paraded them around the city, with their babies hanging at their breasts, and then hurled them down headlong from the wall ({{Bibleverse|2|Macc|6:10|NRSV}}).\" At the same time, the Zealots [[Forced circumcision|forcibly circumcised]] the uncircumcised boys within the borders of Israel ({{Bibleverse|1|Macc|2:46|NRSV}}).\n\nIn the upshot, the Jewish Zealots defeated the Greeks and they retained the right to circumcise.\n\nThe [[Book of Jubilees]], part of the [[Ethiopian Orthodox]] [[biblical canon]],  written in the time of [[John Hyrcanus]], reveals the hostility directed against those who abandoned circumcision (xv. 26\u201327): \"Whosoever is uncircumcised belongs to 'the sons of [[Belial]],' to 'the children of doom and eternal perdition'; for all the [[angels of the Presence]] and of the Glorification have been so from the day of their creation, and God's anger will be kindled against the children of the covenant if they make the members of their body appear like those of the [[Gentiles]], and they will be expelled and exterminated from the earth\".\n\nAccording to the [[Gospel of Thomas]] saying 53, [[Jesus]] says:\n{{quote|His disciples said to him, \"is circumcision useful or not?\" He said to them, \"If it were useful, their father would produce children already circumcised from their mother. Rather, the true circumcision in spirit has become profitable in every respect.\" SV [https://web.archive.org/web/20070813204310/http://www.misericordia.edu/users/davies/thomas/Trans.htm]}} Parallels to Thomas 53 are found in Paul's {{Bibleverse||Romans|2:29}}, {{Bibleverse||Philippians|3:3}}, {{Bibleverse|1|Cor|7:19}}, {{Bibleverse||Gal|6:15}}, and {{Bibleverse||Col|2:11-12}}.\n\nThe ''Jewish Encyclopedia'' in the article \"Gentiles\", section \"Gentiles May Not Be Taught the Torah\", states:\n{{quote|[[Rabbi Emden|R.

R. N., ed. Schechter, p.&nbsp;153; and Talmud, Sotah 12a). Uncircumcision being considered a blemish, circumcision was to remove it, and to render Abraham and his descendants \"perfect\" (Talmud Ned. 31b; Midrash Genesis Rabbah xlvi.)\n\nRabbinic literature holds that one who removes his circumcision has no portion in [[Jewish eschatology|the world to come]] (Mishnah Ab. iii. 17; Midrash Sifre, Num. xv. 31; Talmud Sanhedrin 99).\n\nAccording to the Midrash Pirke R. El. xxix., it was [[Shem]] who circumcised [[Abraham]] and [[Ishmael]] on the [[Day of Atonement]]; and the blood of the covenant then shed is ever before God on that day to serve as an atoning power. According to the same midrash, [[Pharaoh]] prevented the Hebrew slaves from performing the rite, but when the [[Passover]] time came and brought them deliverance, they underwent circumcision, and mingled the blood of the paschal lamb with that of the Abrahamic covenant, wherefore (Ezek. xvi. 6) God repeats the words: \"In thy blood live!\"\n\n===Converts to Judaism===\nAccording to the Hebrew Bible, [[conversion to Judaism]] for non-Israelites necessitated circumcision ({{bibleverse||Exodus|12:48|HE}}). In the 1st century CE, there was a controversy between the [[Shammai]]tes and the [[Hillel the Elder|Hillelites]] regarding a convert born without a foreskin: the former demanding the spilling of a drop of blood of the covenant; the latter declaring it to be unnecessary.\n\n[[Flavius Josephus]] in ''[[Jewish Antiquities]]'' [https://web.archive.org/web/20080907214906/http://www.earlychristianwritings.com/text/josephus/ant-20.htm book 20], chapter 2 recorded the story of [[Izates bar Monobaz|King Izates]] of [[Adiabene]] who decided to follow the [[Law of Moses]] at the advice of a Jewish merchant named Ananias. He was going to get circumcised, but his mother, Helen, who herself embraced the Jewish customs, advised against it on the grounds that the subjects would not stand to be ruled by someone who followed such \"strange and foreign rites\". Ananias likewise advised against it, on the grounds that worship of God was superior to circumcision ([[Robert Eisenman]] in ''James the Brother of Jesus'' claims that Ananias is [[Paul the Apostle]] who held similar views) and that God would forgive him for fear of his subjects. So Izates decided against it. However, later, \"a certain other Jew that came out of Galilee, whose name was Eleazar\", who was well versed in the Law, convinced him that he should, on the grounds that it was one thing to read the Law and another thing to practice it, and so he did. Once Helen and Ananias found out, they were struck by great fear of the possible consequences, but as Josephus put it, God looked after Izates. As his reign was peaceful and blessed, Helen visited the Jerusalem Temple to thank God, and since there was a terrible famine at the time, she brought lots of food and aid to the people of Jerusalem.\n\nOn the other hand, the emperor [[Hadrian]] (117-138 CE) forbade circumcision. His successor [[Antoninus Pius]] (138-161 CE) upheld the decree, but around 140 included an exemption for Jews who circumcised their sons, although not their servants, slaves, or converts.<ref name=\"Hodges2001\"/><ref name=\"Sch\u00e4fer2003\"/> Even before that, in 95 CE, [[Titus Flavius Clemens (consul)|Flavius Clemens]], a nephew of the emperors [[Titus]] and [[Domitian]], suffered the penalty of death for undergoing circumcision, and embracing the Jewish faith with his wife Domitilla (see Gr\u00e4tz, \"Gesch.\" iv. 403 et seq., 702).\n\nIt can be thus understood why during [[Early Christian]] times there existed groups of [[God-fearers]], who were Gentiles who shared religious ideas and practices with Jews, to one degree or another, but refused to circumcise, and were not recognized as Jews.<ref>{{Cquote|''Proselytes ad God-fearers.''-Many scholars see a parallel between the \"God-fearers\" in [[rabbinic literature]] and the \"God-fearers\" in the [[New Testament|NT]]. In rabbinic literature the ''[[Ger toshav|ger toshab]]'' was a Gentile who observed the [[Noahide laws|Noachian commandments]] but was not considered a convert to Judaism because he did not agree to circumcision. [...] some scholars have made the mistake of calling the ''ger toshab'' a \"proselyte\" or \"semiproselyte.\" But the ''ger toshab'' was really a resident alien in Israel. Some scholars have claimed that the term \"those who fear God\" (''yir\u1fbfei Elohim''/''Shamayim'') was used in rabbinic literature to denote Gentiles who were on the fringe of the synagogue.

These terms (circumcised/uncircumcised) are generally interpreted to mean [[Jew]]s and [[Greeks]], who were predominate, however it is an oversimplification as 1st century [[Iudaea Province]] also had some Jews who no longer circumcised (see [[Hellenistic Judaism]]), and some Greeks (see [[proselytes]] or Judaizers) and others such as Egyptians, Ethiopians, and Arabs who did.\n\nIn the Gospel of {{Bibleverse||John|7:23}} Jesus is reported as giving this response to those who criticized him for healing on the [[Biblical Sabbath|Sabbath]]: \"If a man on the sabbath day receive circumcision, that the law of Moses should not be broken; are ye angry at me, because I have made a man every whit whole on the sabbath day?\" This passage has been seen as a comment on the Rabbinic belief that circumcision heals the penis (Jerusalem Bible, note to {{Bibleverse||John|7:23}}) or as a criticism of circumcision.{{citation needed|date=July 2019}}\n\nThe Greek Orthodox Church celebrates the [[Circumcision of Christ]] on 1 January,<ref>[http://www.goarch.org/en/chapel/calendar.asp?Y=2007&M=1 Greek Orthodox Archdiocese calendar of Holy Days] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080213044716/http://www.goarch.org/en/chapel/calendar.asp?Y=2007&M=1 |date=2008-02-13 }}</ref> while Orthodox churches following the [[Julian calendar]] celebrate it on 14 January.

Prior to circumcision a natural leader or Olaiguenani is selected; he leads his age-group through a series of rituals until old age, sharing responsibility with a select few, of whom the ritual expert (Oloiboni) is the ultimate authority. Masai youths are not circumcised until they are mature, and a new age-set is initiated together at regular intervals of twelve to fifteen years. The young warriors (Il-Murran) remain initiates for some time, using blunt arrows to hunt small birds which are stuffed and tied to a frame to form a head-dress. Traditionally, among the [[Luhya people|Luhya]], boys of certain age-sets, typically between 8 and 18 years of age would, under the leadership of specific men engage in various rites leading up to the day of circumcision. After circumcision, they would live apart from the rest of society for a certain number of days. Not even their mothers nor sisters would be allowed to see them.\n\nThe Xhosa Tribe from the Eastern Cape in South Africa has a circumcision ritual. The ceremony is part of a transition to manhood. It is called the Abakwetha - \"A Group Learning\". A group of normally five aged between 16-20 go off for three months and live in a special hut (sutu). The circumcision is the climax of the ritual.

In the oldest written account, by an Egyptian named Uha, in the 23rd century B.C, he describes a mass circumcision and boasts of his ability to stoically endure the pain: \"When I was circumcised, together with one hundred and twenty men...there was none thereof who hit out, there was none thereof who was hit, and there was none thereof who scratched and there was none thereof who was scratched.\"<ref>Gollaher, p.&nbsp;2.</ref>\n\nCircumcision in ancient Egypt was thought to be a mark of passage from childhood to adulthood. The alteration of the body and ritual of circumcision was supposed to give access to ancient mysteries reserved solely for the initiated.<ref>Cf. the old Hebrew classic, Midrash Rabba (Exodus Rabba 30:9), where Aquila of Sinope said to Hadrian the king, \"I wish to become a proselyte.\" When the king retorted, \"Go and study their Divine Law, but do not be circumcised.\" Aquila then said to him,\"Even the wisest man in your kingdom, and an elder who is aged one-hundred, cannot study their Divine Law if he isn\u2019t circumcised, for thus is it written: 'He makes known his words unto Jacob, even his precepts and judgments unto Israel.

Unto the sons of Israel!\u201d</ref> The content of those mysteries are unclear but are likely to be myths, prayers, and incantations central to [[Ancient Egyptian religion|Egyptian religion]]. [[The Egyptian Book of the Dead]], for example, tells of the [[Solar deity|sun god]] [[Ra]] performing a [[self-circumcision]], whose blood created two minor guardian deities.

In the 1840s, radical Jewish reformers in [[Frankfurt]] asserted that circumcision should no longer be compulsory. This controversy reached [[Russian Empire|Russia]] in the 1880s. Russian Jewish physicians expressed concern over two central issues: the competence of those carrying out the procedure and the method used for ''metsitsah''. Many Jewish physicians supported the idea of procedural and hygienic reforms in the practice, and they debated the question of physician supervision during the ceremony. Most significantly, many advocated carrying out ''metsitsah'' by pipette, not by mouth. In 1889, a committee on circumcision convened by the Russian Society for the Protection of Health, which included leading Jewish figures, recommended educating the Jewish public about the concerns connected with circumcision, in particular, the possible transmission of diseases such as [[tuberculosis]] and [[syphilis]] through the custom of ''metsitsah'' by mouth.\n\nVeniamin Portugalov, who\u2014alone among Russian Jewish physicians\u2014called for the abolition of circumcision, set off these discussions. Portugalov not only denied all medical claims regarding the sanitary advantages of circumcision but disparaged the practice as barbaric, likening it to pagan ritual mutilation.

Circumcision was enjoined upon the biblical patriarch [[Abraham]], his descendants and their slaves as \"a token of the covenant\" concluded with him by [[God]] for all generations, an \"everlasting covenant\" ({{Bibleverse||Genesis|17:13|HE}}), thus it is commonly observed by two (Judaism and Islam) of the [[Abrahamic religions]].\n\nThe penalty of non-observance was ''[[kareth]]'' (Hebrew: \"cutting off\") from the people ({{Bibleverse||Genesis|17:10-14|HE}}, {{Bibleverse-nb||Genesis|21:4|HE}}; {{Bibleverse||Lev|12:3|HE}}). Non-Israelites had to undergo circumcision before they could be allowed to take part in the feast of [[Passover]] ({{Bibleverse||Exodus|12:48|HE}}). See also [[Proselyte#Rules for proselytes in the Torah|Mosaic Law directed at non-Jews]] and [[Conversion to Judaism]].\n\nIt was \"a reproach\" for an [[Israelite]] to be uncircumcised ({{Bibleverse||Josh|5:9|HE}}) The name ''arelim'' (uncircumcised) became an opprobrious term, especially a pejorative name for the [[Philistines]], who might have been of [[Greeks|Greek]] origin, in the context of the fierce wars recounted in the [[Book of Samuel]] ({{Bibleverse|1|Sam|14:6|HE}}, {{Bibleverse-nb|1|Sam|31:4|HE}}). When the general (and future king) [[David]] wanted to marry [[King Saul]]'s daughter, the King required a grisly \"[[dowry]]\" of a hundred Philistine [[foreskins]]. David went further: \"and David arose and went, he and his men, and slew of the Philistines two hundred men; and David brought their foreskins, and they gave them in full number to the king, that he might be the king's son-in-law. And Saul gave him Michal his daughter to wife\".({{Bibleverse|1|Sam|18:25|HE}})\n\n\"Uncircumcised\" is used in conjunction with ''tame'' (unpure) for heathen ({{Bibleverse||Isa|52:1|HE}}). The word 'arel' (uncircumcised) is also employed for \"impermeable\" (Lev. 26:41, \"their uncircumcised hearts\"; compare Jer. 9:25; Ezek. xliv. 7, 9); it is also applied to the first three years' fruit of a tree, which is forbidden ({{Bibleverse||Lev|19:23|HE}}). \"The Philistines, more than any other nation, are regularly<ref>Judges 14:3, 15:8, Samuel I 14:6, 17:26,36, 31:14, Samuel II 1:20</ref> called uncircumised\"<ref>Samuel I 13:6 commentary, The Rubin Edition, {{ISBN|1-57819-333-8}}, p. 83</ref> in the [[Hebrew Bible]].\n\nHowever, the Israelites born in the wilderness after [[the exodus]] from Egypt apparently did not carry out the practice of circumcision. According to {{Bibleverse||Josh|5:2-9|HE}}, \"all the people that came out\" of Egypt were circumcised, but those \"born in the wilderness\" were not. In any case, we are told that [[Joshua]], before the celebration of the Passover, had them circumcised at [[Gilgal]].\n\nThe Bible contains several narratives in which circumcision is mentioned. There is the circumcision and massacre of the [[Shechem]]ites ({{Bibleverse||Genesis|34:1-35:5|HE}}), the hundred foreskin dowry ({{Bibleverse|1|Samuel|18:25-27|HE}}) and the story of the Lord threatening to kill Moses, and being placated by Zipporah's circumcision of their son ({{Bibleverse||Exodus|4:24-26|HE}}), and the circumcision at Gilgal of {{Bibleverse||Joshua|5|HE}}.\n\nThere is another sense in which the term \"circumcise\" is used in the Bible. {{Bibleverse||Deut|10:16|HE}} says: \"''Circumcise the foreskin of your heart,''\" (also quoted in {{Bibleverse||Jer|4:4}}, [[New Jewish Publication Society of America Version|New JPS]] translates as: \"Cut away, therefore, the thickening about your hearts\") along with {{Bibleverse||Jer|6:10|HE}}: ''To whom shall I speak, and give warning, that they may hear? behold their ear is uncircumcised, and they cannot hearken: ...'' (New JPS translates: \"Their ears are blocked\"). {{Bibleverse||Jer|9:25-26|HE}} says that circumcised and uncircumcised will be punished alike by the Lord; for \"all the nations are uncircumcised, and all the house of Israel are uncircumcised in heart.\" The New JPS translation adds the note: \"''uncircumcised of heart'': I.e., their minds are blocked to God's commandments.\" Non-Jewish tribes that practiced circumcision were described as being \"circumcised in uncircumcision.\"({{Bibleverse||Jeremiah|9:24|HE}})\n\n===The Intertestamental period===\n{{main|Intertestamental period}}\n\nThe [[deuterocanonical books]] and [[biblical apocrypha]] reveal the cultural clash between Jews and Greeks, and between [[Judaizers]] and [[Hellenistic Judaism|Hellenizers]].<ref name=\"JE\">{{cite web |url=http://jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/4391-circumcision#anchor4 |title=Circumcision: In Apocryphal and Rabbinical Literature |last1=Kohler |first1=Kaufmann |last2=Hirsch |first2=Emil G. |last3=Jacobs |first3=Joseph |last4=Friedenwald |first4=Aaron |last5=Broyd\u00e9 |first5=Isaac |author1-link=Kaufmann Kohler |author2-link=Emil G.

This relatively peaceful period came to an end when [[Antiochus IV Epiphanes]] attacked first Egypt and then sacked and looted Jerusalem ({{Bibleverse|1|Macc|1:16-64|NRSV}}). Epiphanes determined to force everyone to [[Hellenization|live the Greek way]] and abandon the [[Judaizing|Jewish way]]. Among other things, he banned circumcision.<ref name=\"JE\"/><ref name=\"Fredriksen 2018\"/>\n\nAlthough many Hellenized Jews were prepared to conform to Greek culture,<ref name=\"Rubin 1980\"/><ref name=\"Fredriksen 2018\"/> observant Jews saw circumcision as a mark of Jewish loyalty and many who kept to the [[Law of Moses|Mosaic Law]] defied the edict of Antiochus Epiphanes prohibiting circumcision ({{Bibleverse|1|Macc|1:48|NRSV}}, {{Bibleverse-nb|1|Macc|1:60|NRSV}}, and {{Bibleverse-nb|1|Macc|2:46|NRSV}}). Jewish women showed their loyalty to the Law, even at the risk of their lives, by themselves circumcising their sons. \"For example, two women were brought in for having circumcised their children. They publicly paraded them around the city, with their babies hanging at their breasts, and then hurled them down headlong from the wall ({{Bibleverse|2|Macc|6:10|NRSV}}).\" At the same time, the Zealots [[Forced circumcision|forcibly circumcised]] the uncircumcised boys within the borders of Israel ({{Bibleverse|1|Macc|2:46|NRSV}}).\n\nIn the upshot, the Jewish Zealots defeated the Greeks and they retained the right to circumcise.\n\nThe [[Book of Jubilees]], part of the [[Ethiopian Orthodox]] [[biblical canon]],  written in the time of [[John Hyrcanus]], reveals the hostility directed against those who abandoned circumcision (xv. 26\u201327): \"Whosoever is uncircumcised belongs to 'the sons of [[Belial]],' to 'the children of doom and eternal perdition'; for all the [[angels of the Presence]] and of the Glorification have been so from the day of their creation, and God's anger will be kindled against the children of the covenant if they make the members of their body appear like those of the [[Gentiles]], and they will be expelled and exterminated from the earth\".\n\nAccording to the [[Gospel of Thomas]] saying 53, [[Jesus]] says:\n{{quote|His disciples said to him, \"is circumcision useful or not?\" He said to them, \"If it were useful, their father would produce children already circumcised from their mother. Rather, the true circumcision in spirit has become profitable in every respect.\" SV [https://web.archive.org/web/20070813204310/http://www.misericordia.edu/users/davies/thomas/Trans.htm]}} Parallels to Thomas 53 are found in Paul's {{Bibleverse||Romans|2:29}}, {{Bibleverse||Philippians|3:3}}, {{Bibleverse|1|Cor|7:19}}, {{Bibleverse||Gal|6:15}}, and {{Bibleverse||Col|2:11-12}}.\n\nThe ''Jewish Encyclopedia'' in the article \"Gentiles\", section \"Gentiles May Not Be Taught the Torah\", states:\n{{quote|[[Rabbi Emden|R.

R. N., ed. Schechter, p.&nbsp;153; and Talmud, Sotah 12a). Uncircumcision being considered a blemish, circumcision was to remove it, and to render Abraham and his descendants \"perfect\" (Talmud Ned. 31b; Midrash Genesis Rabbah xlvi.)\n\nRabbinic literature holds that one who removes his circumcision has no portion in [[Jewish eschatology|the world to come]] (Mishnah Ab. iii. 17; Midrash Sifre, Num. xv. 31; Talmud Sanhedrin 99).\n\nAccording to the Midrash Pirke R. El. xxix., it was [[Shem]] who circumcised [[Abraham]] and [[Ishmael]] on the [[Day of Atonement]]; and the blood of the covenant then shed is ever before God on that day to serve as an atoning power. According to the same midrash, [[Pharaoh]] prevented the Hebrew slaves from performing the rite, but when the [[Passover]] time came and brought them deliverance, they underwent circumcision, and mingled the blood of the paschal lamb with that of the Abrahamic covenant, wherefore (Ezek. xvi. 6) God repeats the words: \"In thy blood live!\"\n\n===Converts to Judaism===\nAccording to the Hebrew Bible, [[conversion to Judaism]] for non-Israelites necessitated circumcision ({{bibleverse||Exodus|12:48|HE}}). In the 1st century CE, there was a controversy between the [[Shammai]]tes and the [[Hillel the Elder|Hillelites]] regarding a convert born without a foreskin: the former demanding the spilling of a drop of blood of the covenant; the latter declaring it to be unnecessary.\n\n[[Flavius Josephus]] in ''[[Jewish Antiquities]]'' [https://web.archive.org/web/20080907214906/http://www.earlychristianwritings.com/text/josephus/ant-20.htm book 20], chapter 2 recorded the story of [[Izates bar Monobaz|King Izates]] of [[Adiabene]] who decided to follow the [[Law of Moses]] at the advice of a Jewish merchant named Ananias. He was going to get circumcised, but his mother, Helen, who herself embraced the Jewish customs, advised against it on the grounds that the subjects would not stand to be ruled by someone who followed such \"strange and foreign rites\". Ananias likewise advised against it, on the grounds that worship of God was superior to circumcision ([[Robert Eisenman]] in ''James the Brother of Jesus'' claims that Ananias is [[Paul the Apostle]] who held similar views) and that God would forgive him for fear of his subjects. So Izates decided against it. However, later, \"a certain other Jew that came out of Galilee, whose name was Eleazar\", who was well versed in the Law, convinced him that he should, on the grounds that it was one thing to read the Law and another thing to practice it, and so he did. Once Helen and Ananias found out, they were struck by great fear of the possible consequences, but as Josephus put it, God looked after Izates. As his reign was peaceful and blessed, Helen visited the Jerusalem Temple to thank God, and since there was a terrible famine at the time, she brought lots of food and aid to the people of Jerusalem.\n\nOn the other hand, the emperor [[Hadrian]] (117-138 CE) forbade circumcision. His successor [[Antoninus Pius]] (138-161 CE) upheld the decree, but around 140 included an exemption for Jews who circumcised their sons, although not their servants, slaves, or converts.<ref name=\"Hodges2001\"/><ref name=\"Sch\u00e4fer2003\"/> Even before that, in 95 CE, [[Titus Flavius Clemens (consul)|Flavius Clemens]], a nephew of the emperors [[Titus]] and [[Domitian]], suffered the penalty of death for undergoing circumcision, and embracing the Jewish faith with his wife Domitilla (see Gr\u00e4tz, \"Gesch.\" iv. 403 et seq., 702).\n\nIt can be thus understood why during [[Early Christian]] times there existed groups of [[God-fearers]], who were Gentiles who shared religious ideas and practices with Jews, to one degree or another, but refused to circumcise, and were not recognized as Jews.<ref>{{Cquote|''Proselytes ad God-fearers.''-Many scholars see a parallel between the \"God-fearers\" in [[rabbinic literature]] and the \"God-fearers\" in the [[New Testament|NT]]. In rabbinic literature the ''[[Ger toshav|ger toshab]]'' was a Gentile who observed the [[Noahide laws|Noachian commandments]] but was not considered a convert to Judaism because he did not agree to circumcision. [...] some scholars have made the mistake of calling the ''ger toshab'' a \"proselyte\" or \"semiproselyte.\" But the ''ger toshab'' was really a resident alien in Israel. Some scholars have claimed that the term \"those who fear God\" (''yir\u1fbfei Elohim''/''Shamayim'') was used in rabbinic literature to denote Gentiles who were on the fringe of the synagogue. They were not converts to Judaism, although they were attracted to the Jewish religion and [[Law of Moses|observed part of the law]].|author=[[Geoffrey W.

Prior to circumcision a natural leader or Olaiguenani is selected; he leads his age-group through a series of rituals until old age, sharing responsibility with a select few, of whom the ritual expert (Oloiboni) is the ultimate authority. Masai youths are not circumcised until they are mature, and a new age-set is initiated together at regular intervals of twelve to fifteen years. The young warriors (Il-Murran) remain initiates for some time, using blunt arrows to hunt small birds which are stuffed and tied to a frame to form a head-dress. Traditionally, among the [[Luhya people|Luhya]], boys of certain age-sets, typically between 8 and 18 years of age would, under the leadership of specific men engage in various rites leading up to the day of circumcision. After circumcision, they would live apart from the rest of society for a certain number of days. Not even their mothers nor sisters would be allowed to see them.\n\nThe Xhosa Tribe from the Eastern Cape in South Africa has a circumcision ritual. The ceremony is part of a transition to manhood. It is called the Abakwetha - \"A Group Learning\". A group of normally five aged between 16-20 go off for three months and live in a special hut (sutu). The circumcision is the climax of the ritual. Nelson Mandela describes his experiences undergoing this ritual in his biography - \"The Long Walk to Freedom\".<ref>{{cite web\n |url         = http://www.ezakwantu.com/Gallery%20Lister%20Hunter%20Photo%20Set%20A%20-%20Abakwetha.htm\n |title       = Eastern Cape - The Abakwetha Circumcision Ceremony - Xhosa\n |accessdate  = 2013-05-31\n |url-status     = dead\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20130602110524/http://ezakwantu.com/Gallery%20Lister%20Hunter%20Photo%20Set%20A%20-%20Abakwetha.htm\n |archivedate = 2013-06-02\n}}\n</ref><ref>\n{{cite book |last=Mandela |first=Nelson |title=The Long Walk To Freedom |year=1995 |publisher=MacDonald Purnell |isbn=978-0-316-87496-0 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780316874960_0/page/3 3\u201336] |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780316874960_0/page/3 }}\n</ref> Traditional circumcisions are often performed in unsterile conditions where no anesthetic is administered; improper treatment of the wound can lead to [[sepsis]] and dehydration, which has in the past lead to initiate deaths.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Smith|first1=David|title=South Africa urged to end silence on dangerous circumcision rituals|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/jul/27/south-africa-circumscision-danger|newspaper=The Guardian|accessdate=20 July 2014|date=2012-07-27}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Vincent|first1=Louise|title=Cutting Tradition: the Political Regulationof Traditional Circumcision Rites in South Africa's Liberal Democratic Order|journal=Journal of Southern African Studies|date=March 2008|volume=34|pages=77\u201391|doi=10.1080/03057070701832890|url=https://www.academia.edu/6574247|accessdate=20 July 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Ancient Egypt==\n[[File:Circumcision Precinct of Mut.png|thumb|right|250px|Ancient Egyptian carved scene of circumcision, from the inner northern wall of the Temple of [[Khonspekhrod]] at the [[Precinct of Mut]], [[Luxor]], Egypt. [[Eighteenth dynasty of Egypt|Eighteenth dynasty]], [[Amenhotep III]], c. 1360 BC.]]\n[[Sixth Dynasty]] (2345 - 2181 BC) tomb artwork in Egypt is thought to be the oldest documentary evidence of circumcision, the most ancient depiction being a [[bas-relief]] from the [[necropolis]] at [[Saqqara]] (ca. 2400 B.C) with the inscription reading \"Hold him and do not allow him to faint\". In the oldest written account, by an Egyptian named Uha, in the 23rd century B.C, he describes a mass circumcision and boasts of his ability to stoically endure the pain: \"When I was circumcised, together with one hundred and twenty men...there was none thereof who hit out, there was none thereof who was hit, and there was none thereof who scratched and there was none thereof who was scratched.\"<ref>Gollaher, p.&nbsp;2.</ref>\n\nCircumcision in ancient Egypt was thought to be a mark of passage from childhood to adulthood. The alteration of the body and ritual of circumcision was supposed to give access to ancient mysteries reserved solely for the initiated.<ref>Cf. the old Hebrew classic, Midrash Rabba (Exodus Rabba 30:9), where Aquila of Sinope said to Hadrian the king, \"I wish to become a proselyte.\" When the king retorted, \"Go and study their Divine Law, but do not be circumcised.\" Aquila then said to him,\"Even the wisest man in your kingdom, and an elder who is aged one-hundred, cannot study their Divine Law if he isn\u2019t circumcised, for thus is it written: 'He makes known his words unto Jacob, even his precepts and judgments unto Israel. He has not done the like of which to any other nation' (Ps. 147:19-20). Unto whom, then, [has he done it]? Unto the sons of Israel!\u201d</ref> The content of those mysteries are unclear but are likely to be myths, prayers, and incantations central to [[Ancient Egyptian religion|Egyptian religion]]. [[The Egyptian Book of the Dead]], for example, tells of the [[Solar deity|sun god]] [[Ra]] performing a [[self-circumcision]], whose blood created two minor guardian deities. Circumcisions were performed by priests in a public ceremony, using a stone blade. It is thought to have been more popular among the upper echelons of the society, although it was not universal and those lower down the social order are known to have had the procedure done.<ref>Gollaher, p.&nbsp;3.</ref>\n\n==Asia==\n{{See also|Eastern religions}}\nIn early 2007 it was announced that rural aidpost orderlies in the East Sepik Province of Papua New Guinea are to undergo training in the circumcision of men and boys of all ages with a view to introducing the procedure as a means of prophylaxis against HIV/AIDS, which is becoming a significant problem in the country.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}\n\nCircumcision is widely practiced by the [[Druze]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2020}} The procedure is practiced as a cultural tradition, and has no religious significance in the Druze faith.{{Citation needed|date=February 2020}} Male Druze infants are usually circumcised shortly after birth.{{Citation needed|date=February 2020}}\n\nThere is no reference to circumcision in the Hindu holy books,<ref>{{cite news\n |first = Doctor\n |last = Tandavan\n |url = http://www.hinduismtoday.com/archives/1989/02/1989-02-09.shtml |title = Routine Circumcision is Unnecessary\n |publisher = Hinduism Today\n |date = February 1989\n |accessdate = 2010-08-02\n |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20030707213308/http://www.hinduismtoday.com/archives/1989/02/1989-02-09.shtml |archivedate = 2003-07-07}}\n</ref> and both Hinduism and Buddhism appear to have a neutral view on circumcision.<ref>http://whqlibdoc.who.int/publications/2007/9789241596169_eng.pdf</ref>\n \n[[Sikh]] infants are not circumcised.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kyha.com/documents/CG-Sikh.pdf |title=Guidelines for health Care Providers Interacting with Patients of the Sikh Religion and their Families |accessdate=2007-05-01 |publisher=Metropolitan Chicago Healthcare Council |date=November 2000 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070616011136/http://www.kyha.com/documents/CG-Sikh.pdf |archivedate=June 16, 2007 }}</ref> [[Sikhism]] does not require circumcision of either males or females, and criticizes the practice.<ref>{{cite book|author=Devinder Chahal|editor=John Peppin|display-editors=etal|title=Religious Perspectives on Bioethics|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lFdEAgAAQBAJ |year=2013|publisher=Taylor & Francis|isbn=978-9026519673|page=213}}</ref> For example, [[Kabir|Bhagat Kabir]] criticizes the practise of circumcision in the following hymn of [[Guru Granth Sahib]].\n\n{{Quotation|<poem>Because of the love of woman, circumcision is done; I don't believe in it, O Siblings of Destiny.

In the 1840s, radical Jewish reformers in [[Frankfurt]] asserted that circumcision should no longer be compulsory. This controversy reached [[Russian Empire|Russia]] in the 1880s. Russian Jewish physicians expressed concern over two central issues: the competence of those carrying out the procedure and the method used for ''metsitsah''. Many Jewish physicians supported the idea of procedural and hygienic reforms in the practice, and they debated the question of physician supervision during the ceremony. Most significantly, many advocated carrying out ''metsitsah'' by pipette, not by mouth. In 1889, a committee on circumcision convened by the Russian Society for the Protection of Health, which included leading Jewish figures, recommended educating the Jewish public about the concerns connected with circumcision, in particular, the possible transmission of diseases such as [[tuberculosis]] and [[syphilis]] through the custom of ''metsitsah'' by mouth.\n\nVeniamin Portugalov, who\u2014alone among Russian Jewish physicians\u2014called for the abolition of circumcision, set off these discussions. Portugalov not only denied all medical claims regarding the sanitary advantages of circumcision but disparaged the practice as barbaric, likening it to pagan ritual mutilation.
