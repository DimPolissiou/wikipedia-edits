{"title_page": "Ramsey's theorem", "text_new": "In [[combinatorics|combinatorial mathematics]], '''Ramsey's theorem''', in one of its graph-theoretic forms, states that one will find monochromatic [[clique (graph theory)|cliques]] in any [[graph labeling|edge labelling]] (with colours) of a sufficiently large [[complete graph]]. To demonstrate the theorem for two colours (say, blue and red), let ''r'' and ''s'' be any two positive integers.<ref>Some authors restrict the values to be greater than one, for example {{harv|Brualdi|2010}} and {{harv|Harary|1972}}, thus avoiding a discussion of edge colouring a graph with no edges, while others rephrase the statement of the theorem to require, in a [[simple graph]], either an ''r''-clique or an ''s''-[[Independent set (graph theory)|independent set]], see {{harv|Gross|2008}} or {{harv|Erd\u0151s|Szekeres|1935}}. In this form, the consideration of graphs with one vertex is more natural.</ref> Ramsey's theorem states that there exists a least positive integer {{nowrap|''R''(''r'', ''s'')}} for which every blue-red edge colouring of the [[complete graph]] on {{nowrap|''R''(''r'', ''s'')}} vertices contains a blue clique on ''r'' vertices or a red clique on ''s'' vertices. (Here {{nowrap|''R''(''r'', ''s'')}} signifies an integer that depends on both ''r'' and ''s''.)\n\nRamsey's theorem is a foundational result in combinatorics. The first version of this result was proved by [[F. P. Ramsey]]. This initiated the combinatorial theory now called [[Ramsey theory]], that seeks regularity amid disorder: general conditions for the existence of substructures with regular properties. In this application it is a question of the existence of ''monochromatic subsets'', that is, subsets of connected edges of just one colour.\n\nAn extension of this theorem applies to any finite number of colours, rather than just two. More precisely, the theorem states that for any given number of colours, ''c'', and any given integers ''n''<sub>1</sub>, \u2026, ''n<sub>c</sub>'', there is a number, ''R''(''n''<sub>1</sub>, \u2026, ''n<sub>c</sub>''), such that if the edges of a complete graph of order ''R''(''n''<sub>1</sub>, ..., ''n''<sub>''c''</sub>) are coloured with ''c'' different colours, then for some ''i'' between 1 and ''c'', it must contain a complete subgraph of order ''n''<sub>''i''</sub> whose edges are all colour ''i''. The special case above has ''c'' = 2 (and ''n''<sub>1</sub> = ''r'' and ''n''<sub>2</sub> = ''s'').\n\n==Example: ''R''(3, 3) = 6==\n[[Image:RamseyTheory K5 no mono K3.svg|frame|A 2-edge-labeling of ''K''<sub>5</sub> with no monochromatic ''K''<sub>3</sub>]]\n\nSuppose the edges of a complete graph on 6 vertices are coloured red and blue. Pick a vertex, ''v''. There are 5 edges incident to ''v'' and so (by the [[pigeonhole principle]]) at least 3 of them must be the same colour. [[Without loss of generality]] we can assume at least 3 of these edges, connecting the vertex, ''v'', to vertices, ''r'', ''s'' and ''t'', are blue. (If not, exchange red and blue in what follows.) If any of the edges, (''r'', ''s''), (''r'', ''t''), (''s'', ''t''), are also blue then we have an entirely blue triangle. If not, then those three edges are all red and we have an entirely red triangle. Since this argument works for any colouring, ''any'' ''K''<sub>6</sub> contains a monochromatic ''K''<sub>3</sub>, and therefore ''R''(3, 3) \u2264 6. The popular version of this is called the [[theorem on friends and strangers]].\n\nAn alternative proof works by [[double counting (proof technique)|double counting]]. It goes as follows: Count the number of ordered triples of vertices, ''x'', ''y'', ''z'', such that the edge, (''xy''), is red and the edge, (''yz''), is blue. Firstly, any given vertex will be the middle of either 0&nbsp;\u00d7&nbsp;5&nbsp;=&nbsp;0 (all edges from the vertex are the same colour), 1&nbsp;\u00d7&nbsp;4&nbsp;=&nbsp;4 (four are the same colour, one is the other colour), or 2&nbsp;\u00d7&nbsp;3&nbsp;=&nbsp;6 (three are the same colour, two are the other colour) such triples. Therefore, there are at most 6&nbsp;\u00d7&nbsp;6&nbsp;=&nbsp;36 such triples. Secondly, for any non-monochromatic triangle ('''xyz'''), there exist precisely two such triples. Therefore, there are at most 18 non-monochromatic triangles. Therefore, at least 2 of the 20 triangles in the ''K''<sub>6</sub> are monochromatic.\n\nConversely, it is possible to 2-colour a ''K''<sub>5</sub> without creating any monochromatic ''K''<sub>3</sub>, showing that ''R''(3, 3)&nbsp;>&nbsp;5. The unique<ref>up to automorphisms of the graph</ref> colouring is shown to the right. Thus ''R''(3, 3)&nbsp;=&nbsp;6.\n\nThe task of proving that ''R''(3, 3)&nbsp;\u2264&nbsp;6 was one of the problems of [[William Lowell Putnam Mathematical Competition]] in 1953, as well as in the Hungarian Math Olympiad in 1947.\n\n==Proof of the theorem==\n\n===2-colour case===\nThe theorem for the 2-colour case, can be proved by [[Mathematical induction|induction]] on {{math|''r''&nbsp;+&nbsp;''s''}}.<ref>{{cite journal| first1=Norman | last1=Do | title= Party problems and Ramsey theory\n| journal= Austr. Math. Soc. Gazette | year=2006 | volume=33 | number=5 | pages=306\u2013312\n| url=http://www.austms.org.au/Publ/Gazette/2006/Nov06/Nov06.pdf#page=17\n}}</ref> It is clear from the definition that for all {{math|''n''}}, {{math|1=''R''(''n'', 2) = ''R''(2, ''n'')}} = {{math|''n''}}. This starts the induction. We prove that {{math|''R''(''r'', ''s'')}} exists by finding an explicit bound for it. By the inductive hypothesis {{math|''R''(''r''&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;1, ''s'')}} and {{math|''R''(''r'', ''s''&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;1)}} exist.\n\n:''Lemma 1.'' {{math|''R''(''r'', ''s'') \u2264 ''R''(''r''&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;1, ''s'') + ''R''(''r'', ''s''&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;1)}}:\n\n''Proof.'' Consider a complete graph on {{math|''R''(''r''&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;1, ''s'') + ''R''(''r'', ''s''&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;1)}} vertices whose edges are coloured with two colours. Pick a vertex {{math|''v''}} from the graph, and partition the remaining vertices into two sets {{math|''M''}} and {{math|''N''}}, such that for every vertex {{math|''w''}}, {{math|''w''}} is in {{math|''M''}} if ({{math|''v'', ''w''}}) is blue, and {{math|''w''}} is in {{math|''N''}} if ({{math|''v'', ''w''}}) is red. Because the graph has {{math|''R''(''r''&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;1, ''s'') + ''R''(''r'', ''s''&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;1)}} = {{math|{{abs|''M''}} + {{abs|''N''}} + 1}} vertices, it follows that either {{math|{{abs|''M''}} \u2265 ''R''(''r'' \u2212 1, ''s'')}} or {{math|{{abs|''N''}} \u2265 ''R''(''r'', ''s'' \u2212 1)}}. In the former case, if {{math|''M''}} has a red {{math|''K''<sub>''s''</sub>}} then so does the original graph and we are finished. Otherwise {{math|''M''}} has a blue {{math|''K''<sub>''r''\u22121</sub>}} and so {{math|''M'' \u222a {''v''}}} has a blue {{math|''K''<sub>''r''</sub>}} by the definition of {{math|''M''}}. The latter case is analogous. Thus the claim is true and we have completed the proof for 2 colours.\n\nIn this 2-colour case, if {{math|''R''(''r''&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;1, ''s'')}} and {{math|''R''(''r'', ''s''&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;1)}} are both even, the induction inequality can be strengthened to:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cut-the-knot.org/Curriculum/Combinatorics/ThreeOrThree.shtml#inequality2 |title=Party Acquaintances}}</ref>\n:{{math|''R''(''r'', ''s'') \u2264 ''R''(''r''&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;1, ''s'') + ''R''(''r'', ''s''&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;1)&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;1}}.\n''Proof''. Suppose {{math|1=''p'' = ''R''(''r''&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;1, ''s'')}} and {{math|1=''q'' = ''R''(''r'', ''s''&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;1)}} are both even. Let {{math|1=''t'' = ''p'' + ''q'' \u2212 1}} and consider a two-coloured graph of {{math|''t''}} vertices. If <math>d_i</math> is degree of <math>i</math>-th vertex in the graph, then, according to the [[Handshaking lemma]], <math>\\textstyle \\sum_{i=1}^t d_i </math> is even. Given that {{math|''t''}} is odd, there must be an even <math>d_i</math>. Assume <math>d_1</math>is even, {{math|''M''}} and {{math|''N''}} are the vertices incident to vertex 1 in the blue and red subgraphs, respectively. Then both <math>|M|=d_1</math> and <math>|N|=t-1-d_1</math> are even. According to the [[Pigeonhole principle]], either <math>|M| \\ge p-1</math>, or <math>|N| \\ge q</math>. Since <math>|M|</math> is even, while <math>p-1</math> is odd, the first inequality can be strengthened, so either <math>|M|\\ge p</math> or <math>|N| \\ge q</math>.  Suppose <math>|M| \\ge p = R(r-1,s)</math>. Then either the {{mvar|M}} subgraph has a red <math>K_s</math> and the proof is complete, or it has a blue <math>K_{r-1}</math> which along with vertex 1 makes a blue <math>K_r</math>. The case <math>|N| \\ge q=R(r,s-1)</math> is treated similarly.\n\n===Case of more colours===\n''Lemma 2.'' If c>2, then ''R''(''n''<sub>1</sub>, \u2026, ''n''<sub>''c''</sub>) \u2264 ''R''(''n''<sub>1</sub>, \u2026, ''n''<sub>''c''\u22122</sub>, ''R''(''n''<sub>''c''\u22121</sub>, ''n''<sub>''c''</sub>)).\n\n''Proof.'' Consider a complete graph of ''R''(''n''<sub>1</sub>, \u2026, ''n''<sub>''c''\u22122</sub>, ''R''(''n''<sub>''c''\u22121</sub>, ''n''<sub>''c''</sub>)) vertices and colour its edges with ''c'' colours. Now 'go colour-blind' and pretend that ''c''&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;1 and ''c'' are the same colour. Thus the graph is now (''c''&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;1)-coloured. Due to the definition of ''R''(''n''<sub>1</sub>, \u2026, ''n''<sub>''c''\u22122</sub>, ''R''(''n''<sub>''c''\u22121</sub>, ''n''<sub>''c''</sub>)), such a graph contains either a ''K<sub>n</sub><sub><sub>i</sub></sub>'' mono-chromatically coloured with colour ''i'' for some 1 \u2264 ''i'' \u2264 ''c''&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;2 or a ''K''<sub>''R''(''n''</sub><sub><sub>''c'' \u2212 1</sub>, ''n''<sub>''c''</sub>)</sub>-coloured in the 'blurred colour'. In the former case we are finished. In the latter case, we recover our sight again and see from the definition of ''R''(''n''<sub>''c''\u22121</sub>, ''n''<sub>''c''</sub>) we must have either a (''c''&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;1)-monochrome ''K''<sub>''n''</sub><sub><sub>''c''\u22121</sub></sub> or a ''c''-monochrome ''K''<sub>''n''</sub><sub><sub>''c''</sub></sub>. In either case the proof is complete.\n\nLemma 1 implies that any ''R(r,s)'' is finite. The right hand side of the inequality in Lemma 2 expresses a Ramsey number for  ''c'' colours  in terms of Ramsey numbers for fewer colours. Therefore any ''R''(''n''<sub>1</sub>, \u2026, ''n''<sub>''c''</sub>) is finite for any number of colours. This proves the theorem.\n\n==Ramsey numbers==\n<!-- This section is linked from [[Unsolved problems in mathematics]] -->\nThe numbers {{math|''R''(''r'', ''s'')}} in Ramsey's theorem (and their extensions to more than two colours) are known as Ramsey numbers. The Ramsey number, {{math|''R''(''m'', ''n'')}}, gives the solution to the party problem, which asks the minimum number of guests, {{math|''R''(''m'', ''n'')}}, that must be invited so that at least {{math|''m''}} will know each other or at least {{math|''n''}} will not know each other. In the language of graph theory, the Ramsey number is the minimum number of vertices, {{math|1=''v'' = ''R''(''m'', ''n'')}}, such that all undirected simple graphs of order {{math|''v''}}, contain a clique of order {{math|''m''}}, or an independent set of order {{math|''n''}}. Ramsey's theorem states that such a number exists for all {{math|''m''}} and {{math|''n''}}.\n\nBy symmetry, it is true that {{math|1=''R''(''m'', ''n'') = ''R''(''n'', ''m'')}}. An upper bound for {{math|''R''(''r'', ''s'')}} can be extracted from the proof of the theorem, and other arguments give lower bounds. (The first exponential lower bound was obtained by [[Paul Erd\u0151s]] using the [[probabilistic method]].) However, there is a vast gap between the tightest lower bounds and the tightest upper bounds. There are also very few numbers {{math|''r''}} and {{math|''s''}} for which we know the exact value of {{math|''R''(''r'', ''s'')}}.\n\nComputing a lower bound {{math|''L''}} for {{math|''R''(''r'', ''s'')}} usually requires exhibiting a blue/red colouring of the graph {{math|''K''<sub>''L''\u22121</sub>}} with no blue {{math|''K''<sub>''r''</sub>}} subgraph and no red {{math|''K''<sub>''s''</sub>}} subgraph. Such a counterexample is called a ''Ramsey graph''. [[Brendan McKay]] maintains a list of known Ramsey graphs.<ref name=McKay>{{cite web|url=http://cs.anu.edu.au/~bdm/data/ramsey.html|title=Ramsey Graphs}}</ref> Upper bounds are often considerably more difficult to establish: one either has to check all possible colourings to confirm the absence of a counterexample, or to present a mathematical argument for its absence. A sophisticated computer program does not need to look at all colourings individually in order to eliminate all of them; nevertheless it is a very difficult computational task that existing software can only manage on small sizes. Each complete graph {{math|''K''<sub>''n''</sub>}} has {{math|{{sfrac|1|2}}''n''(''n'' \u2212 1)}} edges, so there would be a total of {{math|''c''<sup>{{sfrac|''n''(''n'' \u2212 1)|2}}</sup>}} graphs to search through (for {{math|''c''}} colours) if brute force is used.<ref>[http://www.learner.org/channel/courses/mathilluminated/units/2/textbook/06.php 2.6 Ramsey Theory from Mathematics Illuminated]</ref> Therefore, the complexity for searching all possible graphs (via [[brute-force search|brute force]]) is {{math|[[Big O notation|O]](''c''<sup>''n''<sup>2</sup></sup>)}} for {{math|''c''}} colourings and an upper bound of {{mvar|n}} nodes.\n\nAs described above, {{math|1=''R''(3, 3) = 6}}. It is easy to prove that {{math|1=''R''(4, 2) = 4}}, and, more generally, that {{math|1=''R''(''s'', 2) = ''s''}} for all {{math|''s''}}: a graph on {{math|''s'' \u2212 1}} nodes with all edges coloured red serves as a counterexample and proves that {{math|''R''(''s'', 2) \u2265 ''s''}}; among colourings of a graph on {{math|''s''}} nodes, the colouring with all edges coloured red contains a {{math|''s''}}-node red subgraph, and all other colourings contain a {{math|2}}-node blue subgraph (that is, a pair of nodes connected with a blue edge.)\n\nUsing induction inequalities, it can be concluded that {{math|1=''R''(4, 3) \u2264 ''R''(4, 2) + ''R''(3, 3) \u2212 1 = 9}}, and therefore {{math|''R''(4, 4) \u2264 ''R''(4, 3) + ''R''(3, 4) \u2264 18}}. There are only two {{math|(4, 4, 16)}} graphs (that is, {{math|2}}-colourings of a complete graph on {{math|16}} nodes without {{math|4}}-node red or blue complete subgraphs) among {{math|6.4 \u00d7 10<sup>22</sup>}} different {{math|2}}-colourings of {{math|16}}-node graphs, and only one {{math|(4, 4, 17)}} graph (the [[Paley graph]] of order {{math|17}}) among {{math|2.46 \u00d7 10<sup>26</sup>}} colourings.<ref name=McKay /> (This was proven by Evans, Pulham and Sheehan in 1979.)

Nevertheless, exponential growth factors of either bound have not been improved to date and still stand at {{math|4}} and {{math|{{sqrt|2}}}} respectively.

The untwisted colouring (above) and the twisted colouring (below).]]\n[[Image:K_16 partitioned into three Clebsch graphs twisted.svg|right|thumb]]\n\nA multicolour Ramsey number is a Ramsey number using 3 or more colours. There are (up to symmetries) only two non-trivial multicolour Ramsey numbers for which the exact value is known, namely ''R''(3, 3, 3)&nbsp;=&nbsp;17 and ''R''(3, 3, 4)&nbsp;=&nbsp;30.<ref name=\"bananas\"/>\n\nSuppose that we have an edge colouring of a complete graph using 3 colours, red, green and blue. Suppose further that the edge colouring has no monochromatic triangles. Select a vertex ''v''. Consider the set of vertices that have a red edge to the vertex ''v''. This is called the red neighbourhood of ''v''. The red neighbourhood of ''v'' cannot contain any red edges, since otherwise there would be a red triangle consisting of the two endpoints of that red edge and the vertex ''v''. Thus, the induced edge colouring on the red neighbourhood of ''v'' has edges coloured with only two colours, namely green and blue. Since ''R''(3, 3) = 6, the red neighbourhood of ''v'' can contain at most 5 vertices. Similarly, the green and blue neighbourhoods of ''v'' can contain at most 5 vertices each. Since every vertex, except for ''v'' itself, is in one of the red, green or blue neighbourhoods of ''v'', the entire complete graph can have at most 1 + 5 + 5 + 5 = 16 vertices. Thus, we have ''R''(3, 3, 3) \u2264 17.\n\nTo see that ''R''(3, 3, 3) \u2265 17, it suffices to draw an edge colouring on the complete graph on 16 vertices with 3 colours that avoids monochromatic triangles. It turns out that there are exactly two such colourings on ''K''<sub>16</sub>, the so-called untwisted and twisted colourings. Both colourings are shown in the figures to the right, with the untwisted colouring on the top, and the twisted colouring on the bottom.\n\n[[Image:Clebsch graph.svg|thumb|right|[[Clebsch graph]]]]If we select any colour of either the untwisted or twisted colouring on ''K''<sub>16</sub>, and consider the graph whose edges are precisely those edges that have the specified colour, we will get the [[Clebsch graph]].\n\nIt is known that there are exactly two edge colourings with 3 colours on ''K''<sub>15</sub> that avoid monochromatic triangles, which can be constructed by deleting any vertex from the untwisted and twisted colourings on ''K''<sub>16</sub>, respectively.\n\nIt is also known that there are exactly 115 edge colourings with 3 colours on ''K''<sub>14</sub> that avoid monochromatic triangles, provided that we consider edge colourings that differ by a permutation of the colours as being the same.\n\n==Extensions of the theorem==\nThe theorem can also be extended to [[hypergraph]]s. An ''m''-hypergraph is a graph whose \"edges\" are sets of ''m'' vertices \u2013 in a normal graph an edge is a set of 2 vertices. The full statement of Ramsey's theorem for hypergraphs is that for any integers ''m'' and ''c'', and any integers ''n''<sub>1</sub>, \u2026, ''n''<sub>''c''</sub>, there is an integer ''R''(''n''<sub>1</sub>, \u2026, ''n''<sub>''c''</sub>;''c'', ''m'') such that if the hyperedges of a complete ''m''-hypergraph of order ''R''(''n''<sub>1</sub>, \u2026, ''n''<sub>''c''</sub>;''c'', ''m'') are coloured with ''c'' different colours, then for some ''i'' between 1 and ''c'', the hypergraph must contain a complete sub-''m''-hypergraph of order ''n''<sub>''i''</sub> whose hyperedges are all colour ''i''. This theorem is usually proved by induction on ''m'', the 'hyper-ness' of the graph. The base case for the proof is ''m''&nbsp;=&nbsp;2, which is exactly the theorem above.\n\n==Infinite Ramsey theorem==\nA further result, also commonly called ''Ramsey's theorem'', applies to infinite graphs. In a context where finite graphs are also being discussed it is often called the \"Infinite Ramsey theorem\". As intuition provided by the pictorial representation of a graph is diminished when moving from finite to infinite graphs, theorems in this area are usually phrased in [[set theory|set-theoretic]] terminology.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://people.maths.ox.ac.uk/~gouldm/ramsey.pdf|title=Ramsey Theory|author=Martin Gould}}</ref>\n\n:''Theorem.'' Let ''X'' be some infinite set and colour the elements of ''X''<sup>(''n'')</sup> (the subsets of ''X'' of size ''n'') in ''c'' different colours. Then there exists some infinite subset ''M'' of ''X'' such that the size ''n'' subsets of ''M'' all have the same colour.\n\n''Proof'': The proof is by induction on ''n'', the size of the subsets. For ''n''&nbsp;=&nbsp;1, the statement is equivalent to saying that if you split an infinite set into a finite number of sets, then one of them is infinite. This is evident. Assuming the theorem is true for ''n'' \u2264 ''r'', we prove it for ''n'' = ''r''&nbsp;+&nbsp;1. Given a ''c''-colouring of the (''r''&nbsp;+&nbsp;1)-element subsets of ''X'', let ''a''<sub>0</sub> be an element of ''X'' and let ''Y'' = ''X''&nbsp;\\&nbsp;{''a''<sub>0</sub>}. We then induce a ''c''-colouring of the ''r''-element subsets of ''Y'', by just adding ''a''<sub>0</sub> to each ''r''-element subset (to get an (''r''&nbsp;+&nbsp;1)-element subset of ''X''). By the induction hypothesis, there exists an infinite subset ''Y''<sub>1</sub> of ''Y'' such that every ''r''-element subset of ''Y''<sub>1</sub> is coloured the same colour in the induced colouring. Thus there is an element ''a''<sub>0</sub> and an infinite subset ''Y''<sub>1</sub> such that all the (''r''&nbsp;+&nbsp;1)-element subsets of ''X'' consisting of ''a''<sub>0</sub> and ''r'' elements of ''Y''<sub>1</sub> have the same colour. By the same argument, there is an element ''a''<sub>1</sub> in ''Y''<sub>1</sub> and an infinite subset ''Y''<sub>2</sub> of ''Y''<sub>1</sub> with the same properties. Inductively, we obtain a sequence {''a''<sub>0</sub>, ''a''<sub>1</sub>, ''a''<sub>2</sub>, \u2026} such that the colour of each (''r''&nbsp;+&nbsp;1)-element subset (''a''<sub>''i''(1)</sub>, ''a''<sub>''i''(2)</sub>, \u2026, ''a''<sub>''i''(''r''&nbsp;+&nbsp;1)</sub>) with ''i''(1) < ''i''(2) < ... < ''i''(''r''&nbsp;+&nbsp;1) depends only on the value of ''i''(1). Further, there are infinitely many values of ''i''(''n'') such that this colour will be the same. Take these ''a''<sub>''i''(''n'')</sub>'s to get the desired monochromatic set.\n\nA stronger but unbalanced infinite form of Ramsey's theorem for graphs, the [[Erd\u0151s\u2013Dushnik\u2013Miller theorem]], states that every infinite graph contains either a [[countable set|countably infinite]] independent set, or an infinite clique of the same [[cardinality]] as the original graph.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Dushnik|first1=Ben|last2=Miller|first2=E.

See in particular Theorems 5.22 and 5.23.</ref>\n\nIn [[reverse mathematics]], there is a significant difference in proof strength between the version of Ramsey's theorem for infinite graphs (the case ''n'' = 2) and for infinite multigraphs (the case ''n'' \u2265 3). The multigraph version of the theorem is equivalent in strength to the [[arithmetical comprehension axiom]], making it part of the subsystem ACA<sub>0</sub> of [[second-order arithmetic]], one of the [[Reverse mathematics#The big five subsystems of second-order arithmetic|big five subsystems]] in reverse mathematics. In contrast, by a theorem of [[David Seetapun]], the graph version of the theorem is weaker than ACA<sub>0</sub>, and (combining Seetapun's result with others) it does not fall into one of the big five subsystems.<ref>{{cite book|title=Slicing the Truth|title-link=Slicing the Truth|first=Denis R.|last=Hirschfeldt|publisher=World Scientific|volume=28|year=2014|series=Lecture Notes Series of the Institute for Mathematical Sciences, National University of Singapore}}</ref>\n\n==Infinite version implies the finite==\nIt is possible to deduce the finite Ramsey theorem from the infinite version by a [[proof by contradiction]]. Suppose the finite Ramsey theorem is false. Then there exist integers ''c'', ''n'', ''T'' such that for every integer ''k'', there exists a ''c''-colouring of <math>[k]^{(n)}</math> without a monochromatic set of size ''T''. Let ''C''<sub>''k''</sub> denote the ''c''-colourings of <math>[k]^{(n)}</math> without a monochromatic set of size ''T''.\n\nFor any ''k'', the restriction of a colouring in ''C''<sub>''k''+1</sub> to <math>[k]^{(n)}</math> (by ignoring the colour of all sets containing ''k''&nbsp;+&nbsp;1) is a colouring in ''C''<sub>''k''</sub>. Define <math>C^1_k</math> to be the colourings in ''C''<sub>''k''</sub> which are restrictions of colourings in ''C''<sub>''k''+1</sub>. Since ''C''<sub>''k''+1</sub> is not empty, neither is <math>C^{1}_k</math>.\n\nSimilarly, the restriction of any colouring in <math>C^1_{k+1}</math> is in <math>C^1_k</math>, allowing one to define <math>C^2_k</math> as the set of all such restrictions, a non-empty set. Continuing so, define <math>C^{m}_k</math> for all integers ''m'', ''k''.\n\nNow, for any integer ''k'', <math>C_k\\supseteq C^1_k\\supseteq C^2_k\\supseteq \\cdots</math>, and each set is non-empty. Furthermore, ''C<sub>k</sub>'' is finite as <math>|C_k|\\le c^{\\frac{k!}{n!(k-n)!}}</math>. It follows that the intersection of all of these sets is non-empty, and let <math>D_k=C_k\\cap C^1_k\\cap C^2_k\\cap \\cdots</math>. Then every colouring in ''D''<sub>''k''</sub> is the restriction of a colouring in ''D''<sub>''k''+1</sub>. Therefore, by unrestricting a colouring in ''D''<sub>''k''</sub> to a colouring in ''D''<sub>''k''+1</sub>, and continuing doing so, one constructs a colouring of <math>\\mathbb N^{(n)}</math> without any monochromatic set of size ''T''. This contradicts the infinite Ramsey theorem.\n\nIf a suitable topological viewpoint is taken, this argument becomes a standard [[compactness theorem|compactness argument]] showing that the infinite version of the theorem implies the finite version.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Graph Theory|last=Diestel|first=Reinhard|publisher=Springer-Verlag|year=2010|isbn=978-3-662-53621-6|edition=4|location=Heidelberg|pages=209\u20132010|chapter=Chapter 8, Infinite Graphs}}</ref>\n\n==Directed graph Ramsey numbers==\nIt is also possible to define Ramsey numbers for ''directed'' graphs.

To demonstrate the theorem for two colours (say, blue and red), let ''r'' and ''s'' be any two positive integers.<ref>Some authors restrict the values to be greater than one, for example {{harv|Brualdi|2010}} and {{harv|Harary|1972}}, thus avoiding a discussion of edge colouring a graph with no edges, while others rephrase the statement of the theorem to require, in a [[simple graph]], either an ''r''-clique or an ''s''-[[Independent set (graph theory)|independent set]], see {{harv|Gross|2008}} or {{harv|Erd\u0151s|Szekeres|1935}}. In this form, the consideration of graphs with one vertex is more natural.</ref> Ramsey's theorem states that there exists a least positive integer {{nowrap|''R''(''r'', ''s'')}} for which every blue-red edge colouring of the [[complete graph]] on {{nowrap|''R''(''r'', ''s'')}} vertices contains a blue clique on ''r'' vertices or a red clique on ''s'' vertices. (Here {{nowrap|''R''(''r'', ''s'')}} signifies an integer that depends on both ''r'' and ''s''.)\n\nRamsey's theorem is a foundational result in combinatorics. The first version of this result was proved by [[F. P. Ramsey]]. This initiated the combinatorial theory now called [[Ramsey theory]], that seeks regularity amid disorder: general conditions for the existence of substructures with regular properties. In this application it is a question of the existence of ''monochromatic subsets'', that is, subsets of connected edges of just one colour.\n\nAn extension of this theorem applies to any finite number of colours, rather than just two. More precisely, the theorem states that for any given number of colours, ''c'', and any given integers ''n''<sub>1</sub>, \u2026, ''n<sub>c</sub>'', there is a number, ''R''(''n''<sub>1</sub>, \u2026, ''n<sub>c</sub>''), such that if the edges of a complete graph of order ''R''(''n''<sub>1</sub>, ..., ''n''<sub>''c''</sub>) are coloured with ''c'' different colours, then for some ''i'' between 1 and ''c'', it must contain a complete subgraph of order ''n''<sub>''i''</sub> whose edges are all colour ''i''. The special case above has ''c'' = 2 (and ''n''<sub>1</sub> = ''r'' and ''n''<sub>2</sub> = ''s'').\n\n==Example: ''R''(3, 3) = 6==\n[[Image:RamseyTheory K5 no mono K3.svg|frame|A 2-edge-labeling of ''K''<sub>5</sub> with no monochromatic ''K''<sub>3</sub>]]\n\nSuppose the edges of a complete graph on 6 vertices are coloured red and blue. Pick a vertex, ''v''. There are 5 edges incident to ''v'' and so (by the [[pigeonhole principle]]) at least 3 of them must be the same colour. [[Without loss of generality]] we can assume at least 3 of these edges, connecting the vertex, ''v'', to vertices, ''r'', ''s'' and ''t'', are blue. (If not, exchange red and blue in what follows.) If any of the edges, (''r'', ''s''), (''r'', ''t''), (''s'', ''t''), are also blue then we have an entirely blue triangle. If not, then those three edges are all red and we have an entirely red triangle. Since this argument works for any colouring, ''any'' ''K''<sub>6</sub> contains a monochromatic ''K''<sub>3</sub>, and therefore ''R''(3, 3) \u2264 6. The popular version of this is called the [[theorem on friends and strangers]].\n\nAn alternative proof works by [[double counting (proof technique)|double counting]]. It goes as follows: Count the number of ordered triples of vertices, ''x'', ''y'', ''z'', such that the edge, (''xy''), is red and the edge, (''yz''), is blue. Firstly, any given vertex will be the middle of either 0&nbsp;\u00d7&nbsp;5&nbsp;=&nbsp;0 (all edges from the vertex are the same colour), 1&nbsp;\u00d7&nbsp;4&nbsp;=&nbsp;4 (four are the same colour, one is the other colour), or 2&nbsp;\u00d7&nbsp;3&nbsp;=&nbsp;6 (three are the same colour, two are the other colour) such triples. Therefore, there are at most 6&nbsp;\u00d7&nbsp;6&nbsp;=&nbsp;36 such triples. Secondly, for any non-monochromatic triangle ('''xyz'''), there exist precisely two such triples. Therefore, there are at most 18 non-monochromatic triangles. Therefore, at least 2 of the 20 triangles in the ''K''<sub>6</sub> are monochromatic.\n\nConversely, it is possible to 2-colour a ''K''<sub>5</sub> without creating any monochromatic ''K''<sub>3</sub>, showing that ''R''(3, 3)&nbsp;>&nbsp;5. The unique<ref>up to automorphisms of the graph</ref> colouring is shown to the right. Thus ''R''(3, 3)&nbsp;=&nbsp;6.\n\nThe task of proving that ''R''(3, 3)&nbsp;\u2264&nbsp;6 was one of the problems of [[William Lowell Putnam Mathematical Competition]] in 1953, as well as in the Hungarian Math Olympiad in 1947.\n\n==Proof of the theorem==\n\n===2-colour case===\nThe theorem for the 2-colour case, can be proved by [[Mathematical induction|induction]] on {{math|''r''&nbsp;+&nbsp;''s''}}.<ref>{{cite journal| first1=Norman | last1=Do | title= Party problems and Ramsey theory\n| journal= Austr. Math. Soc. Gazette | year=2006 | volume=33 | number=5 | pages=306\u2013312\n| url=http://www.austms.org.au/Publ/Gazette/2006/Nov06/Nov06.pdf#page=17\n}}</ref> It is clear from the definition that for all {{math|''n''}}, {{math|1=''R''(''n'', 2) = ''R''(2, ''n'')}} = {{math|''n''}}. This starts the induction. We prove that {{math|''R''(''r'', ''s'')}} exists by finding an explicit bound for it. By the inductive hypothesis {{math|''R''(''r''&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;1, ''s'')}} and {{math|''R''(''r'', ''s''&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;1)}} exist.\n\n:''Lemma 1.'' {{math|''R''(''r'', ''s'') \u2264 ''R''(''r''&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;1, ''s'') + ''R''(''r'', ''s''&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;1)}}:\n\n''Proof.'' Consider a complete graph on {{math|''R''(''r''&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;1, ''s'') + ''R''(''r'', ''s''&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;1)}} vertices whose edges are coloured with two colours. Pick a vertex {{math|''v''}} from the graph, and partition the remaining vertices into two sets {{math|''M''}} and {{math|''N''}}, such that for every vertex {{math|''w''}}, {{math|''w''}} is in {{math|''M''}} if ({{math|''v'', ''w''}}) is blue, and {{math|''w''}} is in {{math|''N''}} if ({{math|''v'', ''w''}}) is red. Because the graph has {{math|''R''(''r''&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;1, ''s'') + ''R''(''r'', ''s''&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;1)}} = {{math|{{abs|''M''}} + {{abs|''N''}} + 1}} vertices, it follows that either {{math|{{abs|''M''}} \u2265 ''R''(''r'' \u2212 1, ''s'')}} or {{math|{{abs|''N''}} \u2265 ''R''(''r'', ''s'' \u2212 1)}}. In the former case, if {{math|''M''}} has a red {{math|''K''<sub>''s''</sub>}} then so does the original graph and we are finished. Otherwise {{math|''M''}} has a blue {{math|''K''<sub>''r''\u22121</sub>}} and so {{math|''M'' \u222a {''v''}}} has a blue {{math|''K''<sub>''r''</sub>}} by the definition of {{math|''M''}}. The latter case is analogous. Thus the claim is true and we have completed the proof for 2 colours.\n\nIn this 2-colour case, if {{math|''R''(''r''&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;1, ''s'')}} and {{math|''R''(''r'', ''s''&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;1)}} are both even, the induction inequality can be strengthened to:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cut-the-knot.org/Curriculum/Combinatorics/ThreeOrThree.shtml#inequality2 |title=Party Acquaintances}}</ref>\n:{{math|''R''(''r'', ''s'') \u2264 ''R''(''r''&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;1, ''s'') + ''R''(''r'', ''s''&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;1)&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;1}}.\n''Proof''. Suppose {{math|1=''p'' = ''R''(''r''&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;1, ''s'')}} and {{math|1=''q'' = ''R''(''r'', ''s''&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;1)}} are both even. Let {{math|1=''t'' = ''p'' + ''q'' \u2212 1}} and consider a two-coloured graph of {{math|''t''}} vertices. If <math>d_i</math> is degree of <math>i</math>-th vertex in the graph, then, according to the [[Handshaking lemma]], <math>\\textstyle \\sum_{i=1}^t d_i </math> is even. Given that {{math|''t''}} is odd, there must be an even <math>d_i</math>. Assume <math>d_1</math>is even, {{math|''M''}} and {{math|''N''}} are the vertices incident to vertex 1 in the blue and red subgraphs, respectively. Then both <math>|M|=d_1</math> and <math>|N|=t-1-d_1</math> are even. According to the [[Pigeonhole principle]], either <math>|M| \\ge p-1</math>, or <math>|N| \\ge q</math>. Since <math>|M|</math> is even, while <math>p-1</math> is odd, the first inequality can be strengthened, so either <math>|M|\\ge p</math> or <math>|N| \\ge q</math>.  Suppose <math>|M| \\ge p = R(r-1,s)</math>. Then either the {{mvar|M}} subgraph has a red <math>K_s</math> and the proof is complete, or it has a blue <math>K_{r-1}</math> which along with vertex 1 makes a blue <math>K_r</math>. The case <math>|N| \\ge q=R(r,s-1)</math> is treated similarly.\n\n===Case of more colours===\n''Lemma 2.'' If c>2, then ''R''(''n''<sub>1</sub>, \u2026, ''n''<sub>''c''</sub>) \u2264 ''R''(''n''<sub>1</sub>, \u2026, ''n''<sub>''c''\u22122</sub>, ''R''(''n''<sub>''c''\u22121</sub>, ''n''<sub>''c''</sub>)).\n\n''Proof.'' Consider a complete graph of ''R''(''n''<sub>1</sub>, \u2026, ''n''<sub>''c''\u22122</sub>, ''R''(''n''<sub>''c''\u22121</sub>, ''n''<sub>''c''</sub>)) vertices and colour its edges with ''c'' colours. Now 'go colour-blind' and pretend that ''c''&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;1 and ''c'' are the same colour. Thus the graph is now (''c''&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;1)-coloured. Due to the definition of ''R''(''n''<sub>1</sub>, \u2026, ''n''<sub>''c''\u22122</sub>, ''R''(''n''<sub>''c''\u22121</sub>, ''n''<sub>''c''</sub>)), such a graph contains either a ''K<sub>n</sub><sub><sub>i</sub></sub>'' mono-chromatically coloured with colour ''i'' for some 1 \u2264 ''i'' \u2264 ''c''&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;2 or a ''K''<sub>''R''(''n''</sub><sub><sub>''c'' \u2212 1</sub>, ''n''<sub>''c''</sub>)</sub>-coloured in the 'blurred colour'. In the former case we are finished. In the latter case, we recover our sight again and see from the definition of ''R''(''n''<sub>''c''\u22121</sub>, ''n''<sub>''c''</sub>) we must have either a (''c''&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;1)-monochrome ''K''<sub>''n''</sub><sub><sub>''c''\u22121</sub></sub> or a ''c''-monochrome ''K''<sub>''n''</sub><sub><sub>''c''</sub></sub>. In either case the proof is complete.\n\nLemma 1 implies that any ''R(r,s)'' is finite. The right hand side of the inequality in Lemma 2 expresses a Ramsey number for  ''c'' colours  in terms of Ramsey numbers for fewer colours. Therefore any ''R''(''n''<sub>1</sub>, \u2026, ''n''<sub>''c''</sub>) is finite for any number of colours. This proves the theorem.\n\n==Ramsey numbers==\n<!-- This section is linked from [[Unsolved problems in mathematics]] -->\nThe numbers {{math|''R''(''r'', ''s'')}} in Ramsey's theorem (and their extensions to more than two colours) are known as Ramsey numbers. The Ramsey number, {{math|''R''(''m'', ''n'')}}, gives the solution to the party problem, which asks the minimum number of guests, {{math|''R''(''m'', ''n'')}}, that must be invited so that at least {{math|''m''}} will know each other or at least {{math|''n''}} will not know each other. In the language of graph theory, the Ramsey number is the minimum number of vertices, {{math|1=''v'' = ''R''(''m'', ''n'')}}, such that all undirected simple graphs of order {{math|''v''}}, contain a clique of order {{math|''m''}}, or an independent set of order {{math|''n''}}. Ramsey's theorem states that such a number exists for all {{math|''m''}} and {{math|''n''}}.\n\nBy symmetry, it is true that {{math|1=''R''(''m'', ''n'') = ''R''(''n'', ''m'')}}. An upper bound for {{math|''R''(''r'', ''s'')}} can be extracted from the proof of the theorem, and other arguments give lower bounds. (The first exponential lower bound was obtained by [[Paul Erd\u0151s]] using the [[probabilistic method]].) However, there is a vast gap between the tightest lower bounds and the tightest upper bounds. There are also very few numbers {{math|''r''}} and {{math|''s''}} for which we know the exact value of {{math|''R''(''r'', ''s'')}}.\n\nComputing a lower bound {{math|''L''}} for {{math|''R''(''r'', ''s'')}} usually requires exhibiting a blue/red colouring of the graph {{math|''K''<sub>''L''\u22121</sub>}} with no blue {{math|''K''<sub>''r''</sub>}} subgraph and no red {{math|''K''<sub>''s''</sub>}} subgraph. Such a counterexample is called a ''Ramsey graph''. [[Brendan McKay]] maintains a list of known Ramsey graphs.<ref name=McKay>{{cite web|url=http://cs.anu.edu.au/~bdm/data/ramsey.html|title=Ramsey Graphs}}</ref> Upper bounds are often considerably more difficult to establish: one either has to check all possible colourings to confirm the absence of a counterexample, or to present a mathematical argument for its absence. A sophisticated computer program does not need to look at all colourings individually in order to eliminate all of them; nevertheless it is a very difficult computational task that existing software can only manage on small sizes. Each complete graph {{math|''K''<sub>''n''</sub>}} has {{math|{{sfrac|1|2}}''n''(''n'' \u2212 1)}} edges, so there would be a total of {{math|''c''<sup>{{sfrac|''n''(''n'' \u2212 1)|2}}</sup>}} graphs to search through (for {{math|''c''}} colours) if brute force is used.<ref>[http://www.learner.org/channel/courses/mathilluminated/units/2/textbook/06.php 2.6 Ramsey Theory from Mathematics Illuminated]</ref> Therefore, the complexity for searching all possible graphs (via [[brute-force search|brute force]]) is {{math|[[Big O notation|O]](''c''<sup>''n''<sup>2</sup></sup>)}} for {{math|''c''}} colourings and an upper bound of {{mvar|n}} nodes.\n\nAs described above, {{math|1=''R''(3, 3) = 6}}. It is easy to prove that {{math|1=''R''(4, 2) = 4}}, and, more generally, that {{math|1=''R''(''s'', 2) = ''s''}} for all {{math|''s''}}: a graph on {{math|''s'' \u2212 1}} nodes with all edges coloured red serves as a counterexample and proves that {{math|''R''(''s'', 2) \u2265 ''s''}}; among colourings of a graph on {{math|''s''}} nodes, the colouring with all edges coloured red contains a {{math|''s''}}-node red subgraph, and all other colourings contain a {{math|2}}-node blue subgraph (that is, a pair of nodes connected with a blue edge.)\n\nUsing induction inequalities, it can be concluded that {{math|1=''R''(4, 3) \u2264 ''R''(4, 2) + ''R''(3, 3) \u2212 1 = 9}}, and therefore {{math|''R''(4, 4) \u2264 ''R''(4, 3) + ''R''(3, 4) \u2264 18}}. There are only two {{math|(4, 4, 16)}} graphs (that is, {{math|2}}-colourings of a complete graph on {{math|16}} nodes without {{math|4}}-node red or blue complete subgraphs) among {{math|6.4 \u00d7 10<sup>22</sup>}} different {{math|2}}-colourings of {{math|16}}-node graphs, and only one {{math|(4, 4, 17)}} graph (the [[Paley graph]] of order {{math|17}}) among {{math|2.46 \u00d7 10<sup>26</sup>}} colourings.<ref name=McKay /> (This was proven by Evans, Pulham and Sheehan in 1979.)

There is obviously a huge gap between these two bounds: for example, for {{math|''s'' {{=}} 10}}, this gives {{math|101 \u2264 ''R''(10, 10) \u2264 48620}}. Nevertheless, exponential growth factors of either bound have not been improved to date and still stand at {{math|4}} and {{math|{{sqrt|2}}}} respectively. There is no known explicit construction producing an exponential lower bound. The best known lower and upper bounds for diagonal Ramsey numbers currently stand at\n:<math>[1 + o(1)] \\frac{\\sqrt{2} s}{e} 2^{\\frac{s}{2}} \\leq R(s, s) \\leq s^{-(c \\log s)/(\\log \\log s)} 4^s,</math>\n\ndue to [[Joel Spencer|Spencer]] and [[David Conlon|Conlon]] respectively.\n\nFor the off-diagonal Ramsey numbers {{math|''R''(3, ''t'')}}, it is known that they are of order <math>\\tfrac{t^2}{\\log t}</math>; this may be stated equivalently as saying that the smallest possible [[Independent set (graph theory)|independence number]] in an {{mvar|n}}-vertex [[triangle-free graph]] is\n:<math>\\Theta \\left (\\sqrt{n\\log n} \\right ).</math>\n\nThe upper bound for {{math|''R''(3, ''t'')}} is given by [[Mikl\u00f3s Ajtai|Ajtai]], [[J\u00e1nos Koml\u00f3s (mathematician)|Koml\u00f3s]], and [[Endre Szemer\u00e9di|Szemer\u00e9di]], the lower bound was obtained originally by [[Jeong Han Kim|Kim]], and was improved by Griffiths, [[Robert Morris (mathematician)|Morris]], Fiz Pontiveros, and [[Tom Bohman|Bohman]] and [[Peter Keevash|Keevash]], by analysing the triangle-free process. More generally, for off-diagonal Ramsey numbers, {{math|''R''(''s'', ''t'')}}, with {{mvar|s}} fixed and {{mvar|t}} growing, the best known bounds are\n:<math>c'_s \\frac{t^{\\frac{s + 1}{2}}}{(\\log t)^{\\frac{s + 1}{2} - \\frac{1}{s - 2}}} \\leq R(s, t) \\leq c_s \\frac{t^{s - 1}}{(\\log t)^{s - 2}},</math>\n\ndue to Bohman and Keevash and [[Mikl\u00f3s Ajtai|Ajtai]], [[J\u00e1nos Koml\u00f3s (mathematician)|Koml\u00f3s]] and [[Endre Szemer\u00e9di|Szemer\u00e9di]] respectively.\n\n==A multicolour example: ''R''(3, 3, 3) = 17==\n[[Image:K_16 partitioned into three Clebsch graphs.svg|right|thumb|The only two 3-colourings of K<sub>16</sub> with no monochromatic K<sub>3</sub>. The untwisted colouring (above) and the twisted colouring (below).]]\n[[Image:K_16 partitioned into three Clebsch graphs twisted.svg|right|thumb]]\n\nA multicolour Ramsey number is a Ramsey number using 3 or more colours. There are (up to symmetries) only two non-trivial multicolour Ramsey numbers for which the exact value is known, namely ''R''(3, 3, 3)&nbsp;=&nbsp;17 and ''R''(3, 3, 4)&nbsp;=&nbsp;30.<ref name=\"bananas\"/>\n\nSuppose that we have an edge colouring of a complete graph using 3 colours, red, green and blue. Suppose further that the edge colouring has no monochromatic triangles. Select a vertex ''v''. Consider the set of vertices that have a red edge to the vertex ''v''. This is called the red neighbourhood of ''v''. The red neighbourhood of ''v'' cannot contain any red edges, since otherwise there would be a red triangle consisting of the two endpoints of that red edge and the vertex ''v''. Thus, the induced edge colouring on the red neighbourhood of ''v'' has edges coloured with only two colours, namely green and blue. Since ''R''(3, 3) = 6, the red neighbourhood of ''v'' can contain at most 5 vertices. Similarly, the green and blue neighbourhoods of ''v'' can contain at most 5 vertices each. Since every vertex, except for ''v'' itself, is in one of the red, green or blue neighbourhoods of ''v'', the entire complete graph can have at most 1 + 5 + 5 + 5 = 16 vertices. Thus, we have ''R''(3, 3, 3) \u2264 17.\n\nTo see that ''R''(3, 3, 3) \u2265 17, it suffices to draw an edge colouring on the complete graph on 16 vertices with 3 colours that avoids monochromatic triangles. It turns out that there are exactly two such colourings on ''K''<sub>16</sub>, the so-called untwisted and twisted colourings. Both colourings are shown in the figures to the right, with the untwisted colouring on the top, and the twisted colouring on the bottom.\n\n[[Image:Clebsch graph.svg|thumb|right|[[Clebsch graph]]]]If we select any colour of either the untwisted or twisted colouring on ''K''<sub>16</sub>, and consider the graph whose edges are precisely those edges that have the specified colour, we will get the [[Clebsch graph]].\n\nIt is known that there are exactly two edge colourings with 3 colours on ''K''<sub>15</sub> that avoid monochromatic triangles, which can be constructed by deleting any vertex from the untwisted and twisted colourings on ''K''<sub>16</sub>, respectively.\n\nIt is also known that there are exactly 115 edge colourings with 3 colours on ''K''<sub>14</sub> that avoid monochromatic triangles, provided that we consider edge colourings that differ by a permutation of the colours as being the same.\n\n==Extensions of the theorem==\nThe theorem can also be extended to [[hypergraph]]s. An ''m''-hypergraph is a graph whose \"edges\" are sets of ''m'' vertices \u2013 in a normal graph an edge is a set of 2 vertices. The full statement of Ramsey's theorem for hypergraphs is that for any integers ''m'' and ''c'', and any integers ''n''<sub>1</sub>, \u2026, ''n''<sub>''c''</sub>, there is an integer ''R''(''n''<sub>1</sub>, \u2026, ''n''<sub>''c''</sub>;''c'', ''m'') such that if the hyperedges of a complete ''m''-hypergraph of order ''R''(''n''<sub>1</sub>, \u2026, ''n''<sub>''c''</sub>;''c'', ''m'') are coloured with ''c'' different colours, then for some ''i'' between 1 and ''c'', the hypergraph must contain a complete sub-''m''-hypergraph of order ''n''<sub>''i''</sub> whose hyperedges are all colour ''i''. This theorem is usually proved by induction on ''m'', the 'hyper-ness' of the graph. The base case for the proof is ''m''&nbsp;=&nbsp;2, which is exactly the theorem above.\n\n==Infinite Ramsey theorem==\nA further result, also commonly called ''Ramsey's theorem'', applies to infinite graphs. In a context where finite graphs are also being discussed it is often called the \"Infinite Ramsey theorem\". As intuition provided by the pictorial representation of a graph is diminished when moving from finite to infinite graphs, theorems in this area are usually phrased in [[set theory|set-theoretic]] terminology.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://people.maths.ox.ac.uk/~gouldm/ramsey.pdf|title=Ramsey Theory|author=Martin Gould}}</ref>\n\n:''Theorem.'' Let ''X'' be some infinite set and colour the elements of ''X''<sup>(''n'')</sup> (the subsets of ''X'' of size ''n'') in ''c'' different colours. Then there exists some infinite subset ''M'' of ''X'' such that the size ''n'' subsets of ''M'' all have the same colour.\n\n''Proof'': The proof is by induction on ''n'', the size of the subsets. For ''n''&nbsp;=&nbsp;1, the statement is equivalent to saying that if you split an infinite set into a finite number of sets, then one of them is infinite. This is evident. Assuming the theorem is true for ''n'' \u2264 ''r'', we prove it for ''n'' = ''r''&nbsp;+&nbsp;1. Given a ''c''-colouring of the (''r''&nbsp;+&nbsp;1)-element subsets of ''X'', let ''a''<sub>0</sub> be an element of ''X'' and let ''Y'' = ''X''&nbsp;\\&nbsp;{''a''<sub>0</sub>}. We then induce a ''c''-colouring of the ''r''-element subsets of ''Y'', by just adding ''a''<sub>0</sub> to each ''r''-element subset (to get an (''r''&nbsp;+&nbsp;1)-element subset of ''X''). By the induction hypothesis, there exists an infinite subset ''Y''<sub>1</sub> of ''Y'' such that every ''r''-element subset of ''Y''<sub>1</sub> is coloured the same colour in the induced colouring. Thus there is an element ''a''<sub>0</sub> and an infinite subset ''Y''<sub>1</sub> such that all the (''r''&nbsp;+&nbsp;1)-element subsets of ''X'' consisting of ''a''<sub>0</sub> and ''r'' elements of ''Y''<sub>1</sub> have the same colour. By the same argument, there is an element ''a''<sub>1</sub> in ''Y''<sub>1</sub> and an infinite subset ''Y''<sub>2</sub> of ''Y''<sub>1</sub> with the same properties. Inductively, we obtain a sequence {''a''<sub>0</sub>, ''a''<sub>1</sub>, ''a''<sub>2</sub>, \u2026} such that the colour of each (''r''&nbsp;+&nbsp;1)-element subset (''a''<sub>''i''(1)</sub>, ''a''<sub>''i''(2)</sub>, \u2026, ''a''<sub>''i''(''r''&nbsp;+&nbsp;1)</sub>) with ''i''(1) < ''i''(2) < ... < ''i''(''r''&nbsp;+&nbsp;1) depends only on the value of ''i''(1). Further, there are infinitely many values of ''i''(''n'') such that this colour will be the same. Take these ''a''<sub>''i''(''n'')</sub>'s to get the desired monochromatic set.\n\nA stronger but unbalanced infinite form of Ramsey's theorem for graphs, the [[Erd\u0151s\u2013Dushnik\u2013Miller theorem]], states that every infinite graph contains either a [[countable set|countably infinite]] independent set, or an infinite clique of the same [[cardinality]] as the original graph.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Dushnik|first1=Ben|last2=Miller|first2=E.

See in particular Theorems 5.22 and 5.23.</ref>\n\nIn [[reverse mathematics]], there is a significant difference in proof strength between the version of Ramsey's theorem for infinite graphs (the case ''n'' = 2) and for infinite multigraphs (the case ''n'' \u2265 3). The multigraph version of the theorem is equivalent in strength to the [[arithmetical comprehension axiom]], making it part of the subsystem ACA<sub>0</sub> of [[second-order arithmetic]], one of the [[Reverse mathematics#The big five subsystems of second-order arithmetic|big five subsystems]] in reverse mathematics. In contrast, by a theorem of [[David Seetapun]], the graph version of the theorem is weaker than ACA<sub>0</sub>, and (combining Seetapun's result with others) it does not fall into one of the big five subsystems.<ref>{{cite book|title=Slicing the Truth|title-link=Slicing the Truth|first=Denis R.|last=Hirschfeldt|publisher=World Scientific|volume=28|year=2014|series=Lecture Notes Series of the Institute for Mathematical Sciences, National University of Singapore}}</ref>\n\n==Infinite version implies the finite==\nIt is possible to deduce the finite Ramsey theorem from the infinite version by a [[proof by contradiction]]. Suppose the finite Ramsey theorem is false. Then there exist integers ''c'', ''n'', ''T'' such that for every integer ''k'', there exists a ''c''-colouring of <math>[k]^{(n)}</math> without a monochromatic set of size ''T''. Let ''C''<sub>''k''</sub> denote the ''c''-colourings of <math>[k]^{(n)}</math> without a monochromatic set of size ''T''.\n\nFor any ''k'', the restriction of a colouring in ''C''<sub>''k''+1</sub> to <math>[k]^{(n)}</math> (by ignoring the colour of all sets containing ''k''&nbsp;+&nbsp;1) is a colouring in ''C''<sub>''k''</sub>. Define <math>C^1_k</math> to be the colourings in ''C''<sub>''k''</sub> which are restrictions of colourings in ''C''<sub>''k''+1</sub>. Since ''C''<sub>''k''+1</sub> is not empty, neither is <math>C^{1}_k</math>.\n\nSimilarly, the restriction of any colouring in <math>C^1_{k+1}</math> is in <math>C^1_k</math>, allowing one to define <math>C^2_k</math> as the set of all such restrictions, a non-empty set. Continuing so, define <math>C^{m}_k</math> for all integers ''m'', ''k''.\n\nNow, for any integer ''k'', <math>C_k\\supseteq C^1_k\\supseteq C^2_k\\supseteq \\cdots</math>, and each set is non-empty. Furthermore, ''C<sub>k</sub>'' is finite as <math>|C_k|\\le c^{\\frac{k!}{n!(k-n)!}}</math>. It follows that the intersection of all of these sets is non-empty, and let <math>D_k=C_k\\cap C^1_k\\cap C^2_k\\cap \\cdots</math>. Then every colouring in ''D''<sub>''k''</sub> is the restriction of a colouring in ''D''<sub>''k''+1</sub>. Therefore, by unrestricting a colouring in ''D''<sub>''k''</sub> to a colouring in ''D''<sub>''k''+1</sub>, and continuing doing so, one constructs a colouring of <math>\\mathbb N^{(n)}</math> without any monochromatic set of size ''T''. This contradicts the infinite Ramsey theorem.\n\nIf a suitable topological viewpoint is taken, this argument becomes a standard [[compactness theorem|compactness argument]] showing that the infinite version of the theorem implies the finite version.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Graph Theory|last=Diestel|first=Reinhard|publisher=Springer-Verlag|year=2010|isbn=978-3-662-53621-6|edition=4|location=Heidelberg|pages=209\u20132010|chapter=Chapter 8, Infinite Graphs}}</ref>\n\n==Directed graph Ramsey numbers==\nIt is also possible to define Ramsey numbers for ''directed'' graphs. (These were introduced by [[Paul Erd\u0151s|P. Erd\u0151s]] & L. Moser.)

Soon thereafter, suspecting treachery on the part of their hosts, the Spaniards took [[Moctezuma II]], the king or [[Hueyi Tlatoani]] of the [[Mexica]], hostage. Though Moctezuma followed Cort\u00e9s' instructions in continually assuring his subjects that he had been ordered by the gods to move in with the Spaniards and that he had done so willingly, the Aztecs suspected otherwise. During the following 98 days, Cort\u00e9s and his native allies, the [[Tlaxcaltecas]], were increasingly unwelcome guests in the capital.\n\n===Cort\u00e9s heads off Spanish punitive expedition===\nIn June 1520, news from the [[Gulf of Mexico|Gulf coast]] reached Cort\u00e9s that a much larger party of Spaniards had been sent by [[Diego Vel\u00e1zquez de Cu\u00e9llar|Governor Vel\u00e1zquez]] of Cuba to arrest Cort\u00e9s for insubordination. Leaving Tenochtitlan in the care of his trusted lieutenant, [[Pedro de Alvarado]], Cort\u00e9s marched to the coast, where he defeated the Cuban expedition led by [[P\u00e1nfilo de Narv\u00e1ez]] sent to capture him. When Cort\u00e9s told the defeated soldiers about the riches of Tenochtitlan, they agreed to join him. Reinforced by Narvaez's men, Cort\u00e9s headed back to Tenochtitlan.\n\n===Loss of control in Tenochtitlan===\nDuring Cort\u00e9s' absence, Pedro de Alvarado in Tenochtitlan obtained information that the Aztecs were planning to attack him. In response, de Alvarado ordered a [[Massacre in the Great Temple|preemptive slaughter of Aztec nobles and priests celebrating a festival in the city's main temple]]. In retaliation, the Aztecs laid siege to the Spanish compound, in which Moctezuma was still being held captive. By the time Cort\u00e9s returned to Tenochtitlan in late June, the Aztecs had elected a new Hueyi Tlatoani named [[Cuitl\u00e1huac]].\n\nCort\u00e9s ordered Moctezuma to address his people from a terrace in order to persuade them to stop fighting and to allow the Spaniards to leave the city in peace. The Aztecs, however, jeered at Moctezuma, and pelted him with stones and darts. By Spanish accounts, he was killed in this assault by the Mexica people, though they claim he had been killed instead by the Spanish.<ref name=Diaz>Diaz, B., 1963, The Conquest of New Spain, London: Penguin Books, {{ISBN|0140441239}}</ref>{{rp|294}}<ref name=Miguel/>{{rp|90}}\n\n[[File:Tenochtitlan.jpg|thumb|250px|A map of [[Tenochtitlan]] and its causeways leading out of the capital]]\n{{Aztecbox}}\n\nWith Moctezuma dead, Cort\u00e9s and Alvarado knew they were in a precarious position. Under constant attack, with gunpowder, food, and water in short supply, Cort\u00e9s decided to break out of the city by night. In order to put the Aztecs off their guard, he sent messengers asking for a one-week ceasefire, at the end of which the Spaniards would return any treasure of which they were in possession and would be permitted to leave the city peacefully.<ref name=Diaz/>{{rp|296}}\n\nSince the Aztecs had damaged bridges on four of the eight causeways into the island city, the Spaniards devised a portable bridge they could use in order to cross any unspanned sections of water. Cort\u00e9s ordered that as much of the accumulated gold and other booty as was feasible be packed and carried away, and invited the Spanish soldiers to take and carry away as much as they wished of the remainder. This invitation would lead to the demise of many soldiers who, overburdened with treasure, found it impossible to navigate the causeways and other obstacles encountered on the way out of the city.<ref name=Diaz/>{{rp|297,306}}\n\n===The Spanish head for the causeway out===\nOn the night of July 1, 1520,<ref name = \"calendar\">Various sources give dates ranging from June 30 to July 4, a problem further confounded by the use of the [[Julian calendar]] in Europe at this time, which had diverged from the true (solar) date by almost 12 days.</ref> Cortez's large army left their compound and headed west, toward the [[Tlacopan]] causeway. The causeway was apparently unguarded, and the Spaniards made their way out of their complex unnoticed, winding their way through the sleeping city under the cover of a rainstorm. Before reaching the causeway, they were noticed by Aztec warriors known as the [[Eagle Warriors]], who sounded the alarm.<ref name=Diaz/>{{rp|298,305}} {{discuss}} First by a woman drawing water, and then by the priest of [[Huitzilopochtli]] from atop [[Templo Mayor]].<ref name=Miguel>Le\u00f3n-Portilla, M. 1992, 'The [[Broken Spears]]: The Aztec Accounts of the Conquest of Mexico.'' Boston: Beacon Press, {{ISBN|978-0807055014}}</ref>{{rp|85}}\n\nThe fighting was ferocious. As the Spaniards and their native allies reached the causeway, hundreds of canoes appeared in the waters alongside to harry them. The Spaniards fought their way across the causeway in the rain. Weighed down by gold and equipment, some of the soldiers lost their footing, fell into the lake, and drowned. Amid a vanguard of horsemen, Cort\u00e9s pressed ahead and reached dry land at [[Tacuba, Mexico City|Tacuba]], leaving the rest of the expedition to fend for itself in the treacherous crossing.<ref name=Diaz/>{{rp|299\u2013300}}\n\nSeeing the wounded survivors straggle into the village, Cort\u00e9s and his horsemen turned back to the causeway, where they encountered [[Pedro de Alvarado]], unhorsed and badly wounded, in the company of a handful of Spaniards and [[Tlaxcaltecas]]. According to [[Bernal D\u00edaz del Castillo]], it was at this point that tears came to Cort\u00e9s' eyes, as he realized the extent of the debacle.<ref name=Diaz/>{{rp|300}}\n\nCort\u00e9s, Alvarado and the strongest and most skilled of the men had managed to fight their way out of Tenochtitlan, although they were all bloodied and exhausted. Cort\u00e9s himself had been injured in the fighting. All of the artillery had been lost, as had most of the horses.<ref name=Diaz/>{{rp|302}}\n\nThe sources are not in agreement as to the total number of casualties suffered by the expedition. Cort\u00e9s himself claimed that 154 Spaniards were lost along with over 2,000 native allies. Thoan Cano, another eyewitness to the event, said that 1170 Spaniards died, but this number probably exceeds the total number of Spaniards who took part in the expedition.<ref name = \"Prescott\">Prescott, Appendix.</ref> [[Francisco L\u00f3pez de G\u00f3mara]], who was not himself an eyewitness, estimated that 450 Spaniards and 4,000 allies died.<ref>Prescott, Book 5, Chapter 3.</ref>\n\nMontezuma's son, [[Chimalpopoca (Moctezuma)]] was killed and the [[Tepanec]] prince [[Tlaltecatzin]],<ref name=Miguel/>{{rp|87}} King [[Cacamatzin]], his three sisters and two brothers were also killed.<ref name=Miguel/>{{rp|90}}\n\nDiaz states the Spaniards suffered 860 soldiers killed, which included those from the later [[Battle of Otumba]]. The Tlaxcaltecas lost a thousand. The noncombatants attached to the expedition suffered terribly, 72 casualties, including five Spanish women. The few women who survived included [[La Malinche]] the interpreter, Dona Luisa, and [[Mar\u00eda Estrada]].<ref name=Diaz/>{{rp|302,305\u2013306}} The event was named La Noche Triste (\"The Night of Sorrows\") on account of the sorrow that Cort\u00e9s and his surviving followers felt and expressed at the loss of life and treasure incurred in the escape from Tenochtitlan.\n\n==Aftermath==\nFurther battles awaited the Spaniards and their allies as they fought their way around the north end of [[Lake Zumpango]]. Two weeks later, at the [[Battle of Otumba]], not far from [[Teotihuacan]], they turned to fight the pursuing Aztecs, decisively defeating them \u2014 according to Cort\u00e9s, because he slew the Aztec commander \u2014 and giving the Spaniards a small respite that allowed them to reach [[Tlaxcala (Nahua state)|Tlaxcala]].<ref name=Diaz/>{{rp|303\u2013305}}\n\nIt was in Tlaxcala that Cort\u00e9s plotted the [[siege of Tenochtitlan]] and the eventual destruction of the Aztec Empire.\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of battles won by Indigenous peoples of the Americas]]\n* [[History of the Aztecs]]\n* [[History of Mexico]]\n* [[Juan Velazquez de Leon]]\n* [[Cristobal de Olid]]\n* [[Gonzalo de Sandoval]]\n* [[Dona Marina]]\n\n==Footnotes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==References==\n\n===Primary sources===\n* ''Historia verdadera de la conquista de la Nueva Espa\u00f1a'' (\"True History of the Conquest of New Spain\") by [[Bernal D\u00edaz del Castillo]].

Soon thereafter, suspecting treachery on the part of their hosts, the Spaniards took [[Moctezuma II]], the king or [[Hueyi Tlatoani]] of the [[Mexica]], hostage. Though Moctezuma followed Cort\u00e9s' instructions in continually assuring his subjects that he had been ordered by the gods to move in with the Spaniards and that he had done so willingly, the Aztecs suspected otherwise. During the following 98 days, Cort\u00e9s and his native allies, the [[Tlaxcaltecas]], were increasingly unwelcome guests in the capital.\n\n===Cort\u00e9s heads off Spanish punitive expedition===\nIn June 1520, news from the [[Gulf of Mexico|Gulf coast]] reached Cort\u00e9s that a much larger party of Spaniards had been sent by [[Diego Vel\u00e1zquez de Cu\u00e9llar|Governor Vel\u00e1zquez]] of Cuba to arrest Cort\u00e9s for insubordination. Leaving Tenochtitlan in the care of his trusted lieutenant, [[Pedro de Alvarado]], Cort\u00e9s marched to the coast, where he defeated the Cuban expedition led by [[P\u00e1nfilo de Narv\u00e1ez]] sent to capture him. When Cort\u00e9s told the defeated soldiers about the riches of Tenochtitlan, they agreed to join him. Reinforced by Narvaez's men, Cort\u00e9s headed back to Tenochtitlan.\n\n===Loss of control in Tenochtitlan===\nDuring Cort\u00e9s' absence, Pedro de Alvarado in Tenochtitlan obtained information that the Aztecs were planning to attack him. In response, de Alvarado ordered a [[Massacre in the Great Temple|preemptive slaughter of Aztec nobles and priests celebrating a festival in the city's main temple]]. In retaliation, the Aztecs laid siege to the Spanish compound, in which Moctezuma was still being held captive. By the time Cort\u00e9s returned to Tenochtitlan in late June, the Aztecs had elected a new Hueyi Tlatoani named [[Cuitl\u00e1huac]].\n\nCort\u00e9s ordered Moctezuma to address his people from a terrace in order to persuade them to stop fighting and to allow the Spaniards to leave the city in peace. The Aztecs, however, jeered at Moctezuma, and pelted him with stones and darts. By Spanish accounts, he was killed in this assault by the Mexica people, though they claim he had been killed instead by the Spanish.<ref name=Diaz>Diaz, B., 1963, The Conquest of New Spain, London: Penguin Books, {{ISBN|0140441239}}</ref>{{rp|294}}<ref name=Miguel/>{{rp|90}}\n\n[[File:Tenochtitlan.jpg|thumb|250px|A map of [[Tenochtitlan]] and its causeways leading out of the capital]]\n{{Aztecbox}}\n\nWith Moctezuma dead, Cort\u00e9s and Alvarado knew they were in a precarious position. Under constant attack, with gunpowder, food, and water in short supply, Cort\u00e9s decided to break out of the city by night. In order to put the Aztecs off their guard, he sent messengers asking for a one-week ceasefire, at the end of which the Spaniards would return any treasure of which they were in possession and would be permitted to leave the city peacefully.<ref name=Diaz/>{{rp|296}}\n\nSince the Aztecs had damaged bridges on four of the eight causeways into the island city, the Spaniards devised a portable bridge they could use in order to cross any unspanned sections of water. Cort\u00e9s ordered that as much of the accumulated gold and other booty as was feasible be packed and carried away, and invited the Spanish soldiers to take and carry away as much as they wished of the remainder. This invitation would lead to the demise of many soldiers who, overburdened with treasure, found it impossible to navigate the causeways and other obstacles encountered on the way out of the city.<ref name=Diaz/>{{rp|297,306}}\n\n===The Spanish head for the causeway out===\nOn the night of July 1, 1520,<ref name = \"calendar\">Various sources give dates ranging from June 30 to July 4, a problem further confounded by the use of the [[Julian calendar]] in Europe at this time, which had diverged from the true (solar) date by almost 12 days.</ref> Cortez's large army left their compound and headed west, toward the [[Tlacopan]] causeway. The causeway was apparently unguarded, and the Spaniards made their way out of their complex unnoticed, winding their way through the sleeping city under the cover of a rainstorm. Before reaching the causeway, they were noticed by Aztec warriors known as the [[Eagle Warriors]], who sounded the alarm.<ref name=Diaz/>{{rp|298,305}} {{discuss}} First by a woman drawing water, and then by the priest of [[Huitzilopochtli]] from atop [[Templo Mayor]].<ref name=Miguel>Le\u00f3n-Portilla, M. 1992, 'The [[Broken Spears]]: The Aztec Accounts of the Conquest of Mexico.'' Boston: Beacon Press, {{ISBN|978-0807055014}}</ref>{{rp|85}}\n\nThe fighting was ferocious. As the Spaniards and their native allies reached the causeway, hundreds of canoes appeared in the waters alongside to harry them. The Spaniards fought their way across the causeway in the rain. Weighed down by gold and equipment, some of the soldiers lost their footing, fell into the lake, and drowned. Amid a vanguard of horsemen, Cort\u00e9s pressed ahead and reached dry land at [[Tacuba, Mexico City|Tacuba]], leaving the rest of the expedition to fend for itself in the treacherous crossing.<ref name=Diaz/>{{rp|299\u2013300}}\n\nSeeing the wounded survivors straggle into the village, Cort\u00e9s and his horsemen turned back to the causeway, where they encountered [[Pedro de Alvarado]], unhorsed and badly wounded, in the company of a handful of Spaniards and [[Tlaxcaltecas]]. According to [[Bernal D\u00edaz del Castillo]], it was at this point that tears came to Cort\u00e9s' eyes, as he realized the extent of the debacle.<ref name=Diaz/>{{rp|300}}\n\nCort\u00e9s, Alvarado and the strongest and most skilled of the men had managed to fight their way out of Tenochtitlan, although they were all bloodied and exhausted. Cort\u00e9s himself had been injured in the fighting. All of the artillery had been lost, as had most of the horses.<ref name=Diaz/>{{rp|302}}\n\nThe sources are not in agreement as to the total number of casualties suffered by the expedition. Cort\u00e9s himself claimed that 154 Spaniards were lost along with over 2,000 native allies. Thoan Cano, another eyewitness to the event, said that 1170 Spaniards died, but this number probably exceeds the total number of Spaniards who took part in the expedition.<ref name = \"Prescott\">Prescott, Appendix.</ref> [[Francisco L\u00f3pez de G\u00f3mara]], who was not himself an eyewitness, estimated that 450 Spaniards and 4,000 allies died.<ref>Prescott, Book 5, Chapter 3.</ref>\n\nMontezuma's son, [[Chimalpopoca (Moctezuma)]] was killed and the [[Tepanec]] prince [[Tlaltecatzin]],<ref name=Miguel/>{{rp|87}} King [[Cacamatzin]], his three sisters and two brothers were also killed.<ref name=Miguel/>{{rp|90}}\n\nDiaz states the Spaniards suffered 860 soldiers killed, which included those from the later [[Battle of Otumba]]. The Tlaxcaltecas lost a thousand. The noncombatants attached to the expedition suffered terribly, 72 casualties, including five Spanish women. The few women who survived included [[La Malinche]] the interpreter, Dona Luisa, and [[Mar\u00eda Estrada]].<ref name=Diaz/>{{rp|302,305\u2013306}} The event was named La Noche Triste (\"The Night of Sorrows\") on account of the sorrow that Cort\u00e9s and his surviving followers felt and expressed at the loss of life and treasure incurred in the escape from Tenochtitlan.\n\n==Aftermath==\nFurther battles awaited the Spaniards and their allies as they fought their way around the north end of [[Lake Zumpango]]. Two weeks later, at the [[Battle of Otumba]], not far from [[Teotihuacan]], they turned to fight the pursuing Aztecs, decisively defeating them \u2014 according to Cort\u00e9s, because he slew the Aztec commander \u2014 and giving the Spaniards a small respite that allowed them to reach [[Tlaxcala (Nahua state)|Tlaxcala]].<ref name=Diaz/>{{rp|303\u2013305}}\n\nIt was in Tlaxcala that Cort\u00e9s plotted the [[siege of Tenochtitlan]] and the eventual destruction of the Aztec Empire.\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of battles won by Indigenous peoples of the Americas]]\n* [[History of the Aztecs]]\n* [[History of Mexico]]\n* [[Juan Velazquez de Leon]]\n* [[Cristobal de Olid]]\n* [[Gonzalo de Sandoval]]\n* [[Dona Marina]]\n\n==Footnotes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==References==\n\n===Primary sources===\n* ''Historia verdadera de la conquista de la Nueva Espa\u00f1a'' (\"True History of the Conquest of New Spain\") by [[Bernal D\u00edaz del Castillo]].

He proceeded to evolve the [[Proprietary church]] as a basis for imperial power, preferring to appoint clerics over secular lords for important offices throughout the empire. Like Henry II before him, he insisted on his feudal claim (''Honor Imperii''), yet granted Italy a high degree of self-governance, near complete economic autonomy and recognized and respected the political importance and influence of the city of [[Rome]] and its [[Roman Curia|curia]] in particular.<ref name=boni/><ref name=\"Blumenthal1988\">{{cite book|author=Uta-Renate Blumenthal|title=The Investiture Controversy: Church and Monarchy from the Ninth to the Twelfth Century|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0tZhHot9CuEC&pg=PA45|year=1988|publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press|isbn=0-8122-1386-6|pages=45\u2013}}</ref> His reign marked a high point of medieval imperial rule during a relatively peaceful period for the empire.

His son, [[Conrad, Duke of Lorraine|Conrad the Red]], succeeded him as Count in 941. [[Otto I, Holy Roman Emperor|King Otto I]] (the future [[Holy Roman Emperor]]) elevated him to [[Duke of Lorraine]] in 944. He subsequently married [[Liutgard of Saxony (died 953)|Liutgarde]], one of Otto's daughters in 947 and rose to become one of the king's closest allies. The relationship, however deteriorated, when Otto refused to honor a peace treaty Conrad, as Otto's representative, had negotiated with [[Berengar II of Italy]]. Conrad also resented the growing influence of Otto's brother [[Henry I, Duke of Bavaria|Henry I of Bavaria]], whom he regarded a threat to his position. In 953 Conrad joined the king's son [[Liudolf, Duke of Swabia|Liudolf]] in rebellion against Otto. The rebellion was crushed and Conrad was stripped of his ducal title. Conrad and Otto eventually reconciled. Conrad fought alongside Otto and fell in the decisive [[Battle of Lechfeld]] in 955 that put an end to the [[Hungarian invasions of Europe|Hungarian invasions into Europe]]. Conrad was succeeded as Count of Worms in 956 by his son [[Otto of Worms]], who was also the grandson of Otto I. In between 965 and 970 Otto of Worms' first son and Conrad II's father, [[Henry of Speyer]]  was born, of whom only very little is known. He died the age of 20 between 985 and 990.  Conrad II's mother was [[Adelaide of Metz]]. After Henry's death, Adelaide married a Frankish nobleman and the relationship with Conrad declined.<ref name=urku>{{cite web |url= https://www.dmgh.de/de/fs1/object/display/bsb00000448_00011.html?zoom=0.75&leftTab=toc&sortIndex=030:040:0004:010:00:00 |title= Konrad II  |publisher= Monumenta Germaniae Historica  | date= | author= | accessdate= January 29, 2020 }}</ref>\n\nIn 978 [[Otto II, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Otto II]] appointed his nephew Otto of Worms as [[Duke of Carinthia]]. He succeeded the rebellious Duke [[Henry III, Duke of Bavaria|Henry I of Carinthia]], who had been deposed after the [[War of the Three Henries (977\u2013978)|War of the Three Henries]]. Upon receiving the ducal title, however, Otto lost his countship at Worms, which was given to Bishop [[Hildebald]], emperor Otto II's imperial chancellor. When Otto II died suddenly in 983, his infant son [[Otto III, Holy Roman Emperor|Otto III]] succeeded him, with his mother [[Theophanu]] serving as regent. Theophanu sought to reconcile the imperial house with Henry I, restoring him as Duke of Carinthia in 985, with Otto of Worms allowed to regain his ancestral position as Count of Worms. However, Otto was allowed to style himself \"Duke of Worms\" and his original territory was expanded according to his rank. Otto of Worms loyally served the new Emperor and received the [[March of Verona]] in 955, as the actual Duchy of Carinthia was given to [[Henry II, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry IV of Bavaria]]. In 996, Otto III invested Otto of Worms' son Bruno as [[Pope Gregory V]]. When Emperor Otto III died in 1002, both Otto of Worms, Conrad's grandfather, and Henry IV became eligible for Kingship of Germany. In a compromise, Otto withdrew and in return received the Duchy of Carinthia from the newly elected king Henry IV, who ruled as ''Henry II of Germany''. As a result, Otto of Worms renounced his fiefs at Worms to [[Burchard of Worms|Bishop Burchard of Worms]], a long-time political rival.<ref name=\"Austin2017\">{{cite book|author=Greta Austin|title=Shaping Church Law Around the Year 1000: The Decretum of Burchard of Worms|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wgokDwAAQBAJ&pg=PT4|date=15 May 2017|publisher=Taylor & Francis|isbn=978-1-351-90055-3|pages=4\u2013}}</ref> \n\nAfter the early death of his uncle Duke [[Conrad I, Duke of Carinthia|Conrad I of Carinthia]] the Elder Conrad's infant son, [[Conrad II, Duke of Carinthia|Conrad the Younger]], was named Count of Worms by emperor Henry II while the Duchy of Carinthia passed to [[Adalbero of Eppenstein]] due to Conrad the Younger's infancy.

Gisela had first been married to [[Brun I, Count of Brunswick|Count Bruno I of Brunswick]] the same year. Following Bruno's death around 1010, Gisela had married [[Ernest I, Duke of Swabia|Ernest I]] of the [[House of Babenberg]].{{sfn|Wolfram|2006|p=32}} Through this marriage, Ernest I inherited the [[Duchy of Swabia]] upon the death of Gisela's brother [[Herman III, Duke of Swabia|Duke Herman III of Swabia]] in 1012. The marriage produced two sons: [[Ernest II, Duke of Swabia|Ernest II]] and Herman. After the death of Ernest I in 1015, Emperor Henry II named Ernest II as Duke of Swabia. As Gisela's new husband, Conrad hoped to serve as regent for his minor stepson in the administration of the duchy, seeing it as an opportunity to increase his own rank and subsequently make a claim for his own duchy. Emperor Henry II blocked this attempt by placing the guardianship of Ernest II, and regency over Swabia, in the hands of [[Poppo (Archbishop of Trier)|Archbishop Poppo of Trier]] in 1016. This action further strained the already rough relationship between the imperial [[Ottonian dynasty|House of Otto]] and the [[Salian dynasty|Salian family]].{{sfn|Wolfram|2006|p=35}}\n\nConrad II's hopes to obtain his own duchy failed, but the marriage to Gisela brought him wealth. Her mother, [[Gerberga of Burgundy]], was the daughter of reigning [[Kingdom of Arles|Burgundian King]] [[Conrad of Burgundy]] and granddaughter of the late [[Carolingian Empire|Frankish King]] [[Louis IV of France|Louis IV]]. Gisela also claimed descent from [[Charlemagne]] through both her mother and father. The marriage was opposed by many because of the familial relationship shared by Gisela and Conrad. Both were descendants of  King [[Henry the Fowler|Henry I]] - Conrad in the fifth generation and Gisela in the fourth. According to [[canon law]], marriage was forbidden among relatives from the first to the seventh generation. Though Conrad's marriage differed little from the usual practice of the time, strict canonists frowned upon the marriage and [[Henry II, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Henry II]] relied to this violation of canonical law when he forced Conrad into temporary exile. During this exile, Gisela bore Conrad a son, the future emperor [[Henry III, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry III]], on October 28, 1017.

The dukes of Saxony and Lorraine and his cousin Conrad of Carinthia opposed his rule. In order to strengthen his position, Conrad and Gisela embarked on a royal tour. At [[Augsburg]] he received the support of [[Bruno of Augsburg|Bishop Bruno]] and at [[Strasbourg]] he acquired the support of [[Werner I (Bishop of Strasbourg)|Bishop Werner]], both brothers of former emperor Henry II, were invested to highest office at Conrad's court. After Cologne Conrad stopped at [[Aachen]], where he as successor of [[Charlemagne]], announced to continue the tradition of claim and royal rule of [[East Francia]]. The princes of the [[Duchy of Lorraine]] rejected his claim, though. Conrad then moved north to Saxony, visiting [[Adelaide I, Abbess of Quedlinburg|Abbess Adelaide I of Quedlinburg]] and [[Sophia I, Abbess of Gandersheim|Abbess Sophia I of Gandersheim]], both were daughters of the former [[Otto II, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Otto II]]. They supported Conrad, which helped to rally the Saxon nobility behind Conrad. During [[Christmas]] at [[Minden]], the Saxon nobles, led by [[Bernard II, Duke of Saxony|Duke Bernard II]], officially recognized him as royal sovereign. He in turn had vowed to respect and honor the ancient Saxon customs and laws. Conrad and Gisela would remain in Saxony until March 1025, when they moved on to the [[Duchy of Swabia]], celebrating [[Easter]] at [[Augsburg]] and then proceeded on to the [[Duchy of Bavaria]], spending the feast of [[Pentecost]] at [[Regensburg]]. The royal couple finally visited [[Zurich]], where after ten months they ended their royal tour. Conrad then entered Burgundy in order to renew the royal claim, that in 1016, Emperor Henry II had forced upon the childless Burgundian King [[Rudolph III of Burgundy|Rudolph III]] to name him as his heir.<ref name=\"Wolfram2\"/>\n\nConrad had to address the longstanding ''[[Gandersheim Conflict]]'' upon assuming the German throne. The decade-old dispute dated back to the reign of [[Otto III, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Otto III]] at the unsettled business of who controls [[Gandersheim Abbey]] and its estates. Both the [[Archbishop of Mainz]] and the [[Bishop of Hildesheim]] claimed authority over the Abbey, that also included the right to invest and anoint the Abbey's nuns. Though Otto III had once eased the tensions among the warring parties by declaring that both bishops would be entitled to anoint the Abbess and her sisters, the conflict still lingered. [[Aribo (archbishop of Mainz)|Archbishop Aribo of Mainz]], the new [[Primate of Germany]], counted on Conrad, who was indebted to Aribo for his support during the royal election. In January 1027, the king summoned a [[synod]] at [[Frankfurt]] to end the dispute, but a conclusion could not be reached. He called another synod in September 1028, which also failed.

In June 1025, bishops from [[Northern Italy]], led by [[Aribert (archbishop of Milan)|Archbishop Aribert of Milan]], crossed the Alps in order to pay homage to Conrad. In exchange for certain administrative privileges, Aribert agreed to crown Conrad [[Iron Crown of Lombardy|King of Italy]]. However,the situation in Italy had become increasingly unstable after the death of the Henry II. Amidst occasional riots many Italian aristocrats demanded the secession of the [[Kingdom of Italy]] from the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. The local aristocrats and merchants now considered the Frankish role of protecttors against the Maurian and Byzantine threat to be obsolete. The Italian throne was now viewed as vacant and not available for Conrad's automatic succession as a matter of right.

According to Wipo of Burgundy, the Italian kingship was not compatible with the German thron. Italy was a separate nation from Germany with its own identity. The emissaries justified the actions of their fellow citizens by claiming that Pavia had always been loyal to the Italian king, as long as the king was alive and present, and that the revolt had taken place when the Italian throne was vacant. Conrad rejected the argument, that just as a ship remains devoted to its captain after his death, the Empire remains imperial property after the death of an emperor. The kingdom of Italy, according to Conrad, belonged to the empire as a matter of legal right. In his ''[[Constitutio de feudis]]'' (\"Edict on the Benefices of the Italian Kingdom\") of 1038 he would determine his regulations of the feudal contracts in Italy.<ref name=\"Stock1983\">{{cite book|author=Brian Stock|title=The Implications of Literacy: Written Language and Models of Interpretation in the Eleventh and Twelfth Centuries p. 156|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6Ves8Li9LH8C|year=1983|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=0-691-10227-9}}</ref> Conrad also declared that the Ostrogothic palace was property of the Empire and therefore the king had the right to punish those responsible for its destruction. The Pavian embassy returned to Italy in opposition to [[Salian dynasty|Salian]] rule.<ref name=boni/>\n\nIn February 1026, Conrad assembled a large army of armored knights for an expedition into Italy, including troops commanded by both [[Aribo (archbishop of Mainz)|Archbishop Aribo of Mainz]] and [[Pilgrim (archbishop of Cologne)|Archbishop Pilgrim of Cologne]]. Conrad's army moved south and a contingent besieged Pavia and blocked all trade in the area, as he continued his campaign. By March 1026, Conrad arrived in [[Milan]] and was crowned with the [[Iron Crown of the Lombards]] by [[Aribert (archbishop of Milan)|Archbishop Aribert of Milan]] as [[King of the Lombards]]. From Milan, Conrad traveled to [[Vercelli]], where he celebrated [[Easter]] with the aged [[Leo of Vercelli|Bishop Leo of Vercelli]], who had been a chief advisor to the late [[Otto III, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Otto III]]. When Leo died a few days later, Archbishop Aribert became the chief supporter of the [[Salian dynasty]] in Italy. With Conrad's assistance, Aribert rose to highest ranking religious office in Italy and oversaw the expansion of the [[Basilica of Sant'Ambrogio]] in Milan. In June 1026, Conrad lead his army to [[Ravenna]], but quartering his soldiers among the Ravennese population caused tensions in the city. Conrad then marched north to mitigate the risk the summer heat might pose to his army. In autumn Conrad left his summer camp in the [[Po valley]] and marched to the Burgundian border. Conrad then celebrated [[Christmas]] at [[Ivrea]]. By the end of winter, the Italian aristocrats voluntarily ended their opposition to Conrad's reign.

Rudolph's attendance marked an improvement in the relationship between Burgundy and the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. During the seven-day coronation ceremony, a rank dispute between the archbishops of Milan and Ravenna arose, with Conrad deciding in favor of Milan. Following the synod, Conrad traveled south to receive [[Homage (feudal)|homage]] from the southern Italian states of [[Principality of Capua]], the [[Principality of Salerno]], and the [[Duchy of Benevento]].<ref name=\"Weinfurter19\">{{cite book|author=Stefan Weinfurter|title=The Salian Century: Main Currents in an Age of Transition|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ChuTjtrf9xIC&pg=PA228|year=1999|publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press|isbn=0-8122-3508-8|page=28\u2013}}</ref>\n\nAfter his coronation, Conrad issued decrees to reorganize the monasteries and dioceses of Italy with the particular goal of bringing the church at [[Venice]] under Imperial control (see the ''[[Schism of the Three Chapters]]''). On April 6, 1027, at a [[synod]] held in the [[Lateran Basilica]] with [[Pope John XIX]], the Emperor resolved the dispute in favor of Old-Aquileia. The [[Patriarchate of Aquileia|Patriarch of Aquleia]] [[Poppo of Treffen|Poppo]] had been a loyal supporter of Emperor Henry II, who appointed him as Patriarch in 1020 during the Emperor's campaign to reassert his authority in Italy. Conrad's action placed the church at Grado under Poppo's authority, securing Poppo's loyalty by making him the Emperor's top official in northern Italy. The synod ended the independence of the Grado church and limited the political autonomy of Venice. In so doing, Conrad broke with the policies of his predecessors and revoked Venice's privileged trading status.<ref name=\"Schutz2010\"/>\n\nToward the end of May 1027, Conrad returned north to Germany to attend the funeral of [[Henry V, Duke of Bavaria|Duke Henry V of Bavaria]] at [[Regensburg]]. With the [[Duchy of Bavaria]] left vacant, Conrad asserted his right to name a next duke as a matter of [[royal prerogative]], taking the unprecedented decision of naming his 10-year-old son [[Henry III, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry]] as Duke of Bavaria despite the existence of candidates with a better claim to the Duchy. Never before had the Bavarian Duchy passed to a non-member of the Bavarian ducal family.\n\nThe young prince assumed the Bavarian dignity on 24 June 1027. Following Henry's appointment, Conrad held court at Regensburg and issued a decree requiring an accounting of all imperial property in the duchy. This required the various counts and bishops to report to Conrad all property they possessed in their castles and abbeys that belonged to the Emperor. Even the [[Dowager Empress]] [[Cunigunde of Luxembourg]] was required to report to Conrad, with the Emperor even claiming Cunegonde's ''[[wittum]]'' (money and property left to her by her late husband Emperor Henry II) as belonging to him. Conrad's promotion of imperial authority over the ducal succession and his claims to property throughout Bavaria caused tension between him and the German aristocracy, who viewed Conrad's actions as infringing upon their privileges.{{sfn|Wolfram|2006|p=114}}\n\n===Uprising in Swabia===\n[[File:MPano 07.jpg|thumb|200px|left|The [[Konstanz Minster]], seat of the [[Bishop of Constance]]]]\n[[File:Oberfalkenstein.jpg|thumb|200px|left|ruins of the ''Upper Falkenstein Castle'', 2008]]\nIn 1025, [[Ernest II, Duke of Swabia|Duke Ernest II of Swabia]], Conrad's stepson from his marriage to [[Gisela of Swabia]], rebelled against his stepfather when he was elected king of Germany. By 1026, Conrad had defeated the resistance and Ernest submitted to his reign. Due to the intervention of his mother Gisela, Ernest was allowed to accompany Conrad on his expedition to Italy in 1026. During the expedition, the rebellion led by [[Conrad II, Duke of Carinthia|Conrad of Carinthia]] and [[Welf II, Count of Swabia|Count Welf II of Swabia]] continued. Conrad had named [[Bruno of Augsburg|Bishop Bruno of Augsburg]] regent of Germany while he marched south to Italy.  When Bruno was defeated by the rebels, Conrad sent Ernest back to Germany in September 1026 to end the revolt. When Ernest returned, he joined the opposition and rebelled against Conrad again.\n\nIn 1027 Conrad returned to Germany after his imperial coronation and held court at [[Augsburg]], calling upon the rebels to surrender. Ernest, trusting in the number and fidelity of his vassals, rejected the peace offer and appealed to his Swabian counts to join him in the rebellion. According to [[Wipo of Burgundy]], the counts refused, stating that while they had sworn loyalty to Ernest, they would not rebel against their Emperor. Without the support of the Swabian counts, Ernest, Conrad of Carinthia and Count Welf surrendered to Conrad at [[Worms, Germany|Worms]] on September 9, 1027, ending the rebellion. Conrad stripped Ernest of his ducal title and imprisoned him at [[Giebichenstein Castle]] in [[Duchy of Saxony|Saxony]]. Gisela supported Conrad against her son, but did not want Ernest to be entirely humiliated. As a result of his mother's intervention, Conrad allowed Ernest to retain his title while imprisoned, with Gisela serving as regent over the duchy.<ref name=\"Schutz2010\"/>\n\nIn 1028, after Conrad's son [[Henry III, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry]] was crowned in Aachen as King of Germany, Gisela again intervened on Ernest's behalf. Conrad pardoned Ernest and released him from prison in 1028, but Gisela retained regency over Swabia. Ernest served as duke in name only. On Easter 1030, Conrad offered to restore Ernest his full powers as Duke of Swabia if he would crack down on the Emperor's enemies there. Ernest's refusal, especially against his friend Count Werner of Kyburg, resulted in his final downfall. Conrad stripped his stepson of his title, declared him a public enemy, and had him [[excommunicated]]. Even his mother Gisela did not come to his rescue. Within a few months, both Ernest and Werner, who had retreated to ''Falkenstein Castle'', south of modern [[Schramberg]] in the [[Black Forest]] were killed in a battle against a contingent of the [[Bishop of Constance]]. The fall of Ernest greatly weakened the sovereignty of Swabia. Conrad appointed Ernest's younger brother [[Herman IV, Duke of Swabia|Herman]] as new Swabian prince. As Herman was still an infant, the Bishop of Constance was assigned his regent. Eight years later in 1038, Herman died and Conrad installed his own son Henry as duke, securing imperial control over the duchy.<ref name=\"Schutz2010\"/>\n\n===Conflict with Adalbero===\nConrad had to enforce his [[royal prerogative]]s in the [[Duchy of Carinthia]] and the [[Duchy of Swabia]]. [[Adalbero, Duke of Carinthia|Duke Adalbero of Carinthia]] had been appointed as duke in 1012 under Emperor Henry II and remained loyal to imperial authority, supporting Conrad's election as German king in 1024. At a [[synod]] in [[Frankfurt]] in September 1027, Conrad attempted to resolve the decades' long ''Gandersheim Conflict''. Adalbero accompanied the Emperor and acted as his sword-bearer during the proceeding, indicating Conrad's trust in him. From 1028 on, Adalbero governed his Duchy as an independent state.\n\nIn particular, he attempted to conduct peaceful relations with the [[Stephen I of Hungary|King Stephen I]] of the [[Kingdom of Hungary (1000\u20131301)|Kingdom of Hungary]]. Under Emperor Henry II, who was the brother-in-law to Stephen, relations between the Empire and Hungary had been friendly. Upon Henry's death in 1024, Conrad adopted a more aggressive policy, prompting border raids into the Empire from Hungary. The raids particularly affected Adalbero's domain of Carinthia, which shared a long, eastern border with Hungary.{{sfn|Gy\u00f6rffy|1994|p= 140}}{{sfn|Makk|2001|p=45}}\n\nConrad summoned Adalbero to court at [[Bamberg]] on 18 May 1035, to answer an indictment of [[treason]] for his actions regarding Hungary. In the presence of the German dukes, Conrad demanded that Adalbero be stripped of all his titles and lands. The dukes hesitated and demanded that Conrad's son [[Henry III, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry]], the Germany's co-King and Conrad's designated successor, join the assembly before a decision was made. Henry refused to depose Adalbero, citing an earlier agreement with Adelbero to be his ally in negotiating a settlement between him and his father. Conrad resorted to exhortations, pleas, and threats to convince Henry to support Adalbero's deposition. Henry's support was soon followed by that of the other dukes. Conrad then ordered Adalbero to be removed as Duke and sentenced him and his son to [[exile]]. After attacking Conrad's allies in Carinthia, Adalbero fled to his mother's estates in [[Ebersberg]] in the [[Duchy of Bavaria]], where he remained until his death in 1039. The duchy of Carinthia remained unoccupied until February 2, 1035, when Conrad named his cousin [[Conrad II, Duke of Carinthia|Conrad the Younger]] as the new duke. With the appointment, the three southern German duchies of Swabia, Bavaria, and Carinthia were all under the control of Emperor Conrad through his family members (his stepson Herman in Swabia, his son Henry in Bavaria, and his cousin Conrad in Carinthia).{{sfn|Wolfram|2006|p=84}}\n\nControl of the southern duchies allowed Conrad to continue the process begun under the [[Ottonian dynasty]], centralizing the Emperors authority over the Empire at the expense of the regional dukes. Conrad broke with Ottonian tradition, however, in favoring a more strict means of controlling rebellious vassals. Whereas the Ottonians followed a policy of informal public submission and subsequent reconciliation, Conrad used treason trials to declare rebels as \"public enemies\" to legitimize his subsequent harsh treatment, as he had done with [[Ernest II, Duke of Swabia|Ernest II of Swabia]] and Adalbero. The nobles saw use of these treason trials not as mere power shifts in favor of the Emperor, but as a cruel breach of German tradition.{{sfn|Wolfram|2006|p=88}}\n\n===Policy towards the Church===\n[[File:Bischof Poppo von Trier.png|thumb|[[Prince-bishop]] [[Poppo (archbishop of Trier)|Poppo von Babenberg]] was [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Trier|archbishop of Trier]] and imperial prince of the [[Electorate of Trier]]]]\nConrad continued the [[Ottonian dynasty]]'s [[Imperial Church System]] - a policy of using the German Church as a vehicle for imperial control. Beginning in the 950s, the Ottonians had favored Church officials over secular nobles for appointment to the Empire's most important offices. Claiming \"[[divine right of king|divine right]]\" to rule the Empire, the Ottonians increasingly viewed themselves as [[defender of the faith|protectors of the Church]] and thus demanded loyalty from the Church officials.<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-ecclesiastical-history/article/imperial-church-system-of-the-ottonian-and-salian-rulers-a-reconsideration/8B8887F785FC72BFD48A4A5DDF8A49C2 |title= The \u2018Imperial Church System\u2019 of the Ottonian and Salian Rulers: a Reconsideration|publisher= Cambridge Org | date=March 25, 2011   | author=Timothy Reuter   | accessdate= January 27, 2020 }}</ref> In return, the various bishoprics and abbeys of the Empire were granted extensive landholdings and secular authority, providing immunity from the jurisdiction of the secular nobles.

It also required the Church officials to act as quasi-bureaucracy for the Empire. Under military service, the Church was required to supply soldiers for the Emperors' army or to act as diplomats at his direction.

Conrad and the other members of the [[Salian dynasty]] had little interest in the founding of new monasteries. Through their hundred-year dynasty, the Salians only founded one: [[Limburg Abbey]] which was converted from a fortress to a monastery in 1025.  The Ottonians established at least eight in their hundred-year reign. Additionally, the Ottonians were active in the establishment of Church affairs, but Conrad was uninterested, only calling five [[synods]] during his reign and usually only to restore peace. Conrad's decisions on Church policy were often left to his wife [[Gisela of Swabia]]. When [[Aribo, Archbishop of Mainz|Archbishop Aribo of Mainz]], [[Primate of Germany]], died in 1031, Conrad considered both [[Bardo (bishop)|Abbot Bardo]] of [[Hersfeld Abbey]] and the renowned [[theologian]] [[Wazo of Li\u00e8ge]], then serving as the dean of the [[cathedral chapter]] for the [[Prince-Bishopric of Li\u00e8ge|Bishop of Liege]]. Though Conrad favored Wazo to lead the German Church as Archbishop and Primate, Gisela convinced him to appoint Bardo instead.<ref name=\"M\u00f6llerAmmerich2015\"/>\n\n===Relations with Poland===\n\n====War with Mieszko====\n[[File:Polska 992 - 1025.png|thumb|350px|right|The [[Duchies of Poland|Duchy of Poland]] at its greatest extent under [[Boleslaw I of Poland|Boles\u0142aw I]] and his son [[Mieszko II of Poland|Mieszko II]].]]\n\n[[Boles\u0142aw I Chrobry|Duke Boles\u0142aw I of Poland]] warred with [[Henry II, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Henry II]] three times during the [[German-Polish War (1002\u20131018)|German-Polish Wars from 1002 to 1018]]. In January 1018, Henry II and Boles\u0142aw I signed a peace treaty, known as the [[Peace of Bautzen]],<ref name=Knefelkamp123>Knefelkamp (2002), p. 125</ref> in which the Empire and Poland declared a permanent peace with Boles\u0142aw recognizing Henry II as his nominal feudal lord.<ref name=cmh>Previte-orton, pg. 451</ref> In return, Henry II granted to Boles\u0142aw lands on the Empire's eastern border. To seal the peace, Boles\u0142aw I, a widower, reinforced his dynastic bonds with the German nobility by marrying [[Oda of Meissen]], daughter of the Saxon Margrave Eckard I of Meissen. Empire and Poland remained at peace for the remainder of Henry's reign. Henry's death in 1024 gave Boles\u0142aw an opportunity to increase his own power. Boles\u0142aw took advantage of the interregnum in Germany and crowned himself king on [[Easter]], April 25, 1025. Boles\u0142aw was thus the first Polish king as his predecessors had been considered mere \"dukes\" by both the Empire and the Pope in Rome. Boles\u0142aw died within two months of the coronation, most likely due to an illness. Boles\u0142aw's son, [[Mieszko II Lambert]], succeeded him as King, being crowned on Christmas Day 1025. Upon assuming the Polish throne, Mieszko expelled his older half-brother [[Bezprym]] and his younger brother [[Otto Boles\u0142awowic]]. Otto went to Germany to seek Conrad's protection.{{sfn|Wolfram|2006|p=209}}\n\nConrad considered the assumption of the title \"king\" by Mieszko an act of war and a disregard of his imperial authority, but had to address domestic issues before marching against Mieszko. In 1026 Conrad II marched into Italy to assert German authority south of the Alps and to claim the imperial crown from the Pope. In his absence, [[Ernest II, Duke of Swabia|Duke Ernest II of Swabia]], [[Conrad II, Duke of Carinthia|Conrad the Younger]], and [[Frederick II, Duke of Upper Lorraine|Duke Frederick II of Upper Lorraine]] rebelled against his authority.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://archive.is/20130701012634/http://bsbndb.bsb.lrz-muenchen.de/sfz58985.html |title= Mathilde von Schwaben  |publisher=  Neue deutsche Biographie | date=  | author=Eckhard Freise    | accessdate= April 1, 2020 }}</ref>\n\nThe rebels sought the support of Mieszko, which the Polish king granted and promised to take military action against Conrad. Conrad returned to Germany in mid-1027, putting an end to the rebellion before Mieszko could marshal his forces. In preparations for his own invasion of Poland, Conrad developed a closer relationship with [[Cnut the Great|Cnut, King of England and Denmark]] (whose kingdom lay along the Empire's northern border). Cnut accompanied Conrad to his coronation as emperor in 1027, and Conrad granted authority over the [[Duchy of Schleswig|March of Schleswig]], the land-bridge between Denmark and Germany.{{sfn|Wolfram|2006|p=215}}\n\nFearing a joint German-Danish attack, Mieszko invaded the Empire's [[March of Lusatia]] and the territory of the [[Lutici|Lutician Federation]] in 1028.<ref name=Herrmann363>Herrmann (1985), p. 363</ref> The Lutici were a federation of [[West Slavs|West Slavic]] [[Polabian Slavs|Polabian]] tribes that developed in the 10th century. Located on the northeast border of Germany, the Lutici were the regular target of German aggression during the early years of the [[Ottonian dynasty]] with [[Emperor Otto I]]'s lieutenants [[Herman Billung]] and [[Gero]], subjugating many of the Slavic tribes beginning in the 940s. In 983, as part of the [[Great Slav Rising]], the Lutici initiated an open rebellion.  In the ensuing war (983-995), the Lutici succeeded in reclaiming their independence and gained control of the [[Billung March]] and [[Northern March]] from the Empire.<ref name=Luebke99>L\u00fcbke (2002), p. 99</ref> Though [[Emperor Otto III]] allied with [[Boles\u0142aw I Chrobry|Duke Boles\u0142aw I of Poland]] to reintegrate them into the Empire, Otto III's death ended the friendly relationship between Poland the Empire. Instead, Boles\u0142aw competed with Otto III's successor, Emperor Henry II, for dominion over the Lutici, causing Henry II to ally the Empire with the Lutici against Poland. Under the [[Peace of Bautzen]] in 1018, all three parties remained in uneasy peace, with Poland allowed to hold the Empire's [[Margraviate of Meissen]]. Of the eastern marches, the Empire only retained the [[March of Lusatia]]. Mieszko's 1028 invasion ended the peace. The Lutici sent ambassadors to seek Conrad's protection against Mieszko, which Conrad granted and renewed the German-Lutician alliance.<ref name=Herrmann363/>\n\nSeeking to protect the Lutici from Polish invasion, Conrad launched a counter-invasion in 1029 and placed the Polish-held [[Bautzen]] under siege. Faced with a potential invasion by Hungary and the failure of the Lutici to provide their promised contingent of troops, Conrad retreated. In 1030, Poland secured an alliance with Hungary, with Stephen I invading Bavaria while Mieszko invaded Saxony. Conrad responded by allying with [[Yaroslav the Wise]], [[Grand Prince of Kiev]], to attack and capture [[Red Ruthenia]] on Poland's eastern border. In 1031, Conrad concluded a peace treaty with Hungary by ceding territory in eastern [[Duchy of Carinthia|Carinithia]] to Hungarian control. Freed from the threat of Hungarian attack, the Emperor was able to focus his attention on attacking Poland. Marching on Mieszko in autumn 1031, Conrad laid siege at the Polish held-[[Bautzen]] in the [[Margraviate of Meissen]]. Mieszko's authority was shaken by the German and Kieven invasions, and the rebellion led by his exiled brother [[Bezprym]]. Mieszko surrendered to Conrad in fall 1031. Under the [[Treaty of Merseburg]], Mieszko returned control over the [[Margraviate of Meissen]] and the [[March of Lusatia]] to the Empire.<ref name=\"Boshof 2008, p. 71\">Boshof (2008), p. 71</ref>\n\n====Treaty of Merseburg====\n[[File:Wojciech Gerson-Krolowa Ryksa.jpg|thumb|left|19th century painting of king [[Mieszko II Lambert|Mieszko II's]] wife [[Richeza of Lotharingia|Queen Richeza]] (Wojciech Gerson, 1891) ]]\nSoon after Mieszko concluded peace with the Empire, he was deposed by his half-brother [[Bezprym]]. When Mieszko assumed the Polish throne in 1025 he exiled his brother, who fled to the protection of [[Kievan Rus]] to the east of Poland. With Meiszko's position weakened by his wars with the Empire, Bezprym, supported by Conrad, persuaded the Kevian Grand Price [[Yaroslav I the Wise]] to invade Poland and install Bezprym as the country's ruler. The Kievan invasion was a success. Mieszko fled to the [[Duchy of Bohemia]] where he was imprisoned and [[castrated]] by [[Old\u0159ich, Duke of Bohemia|Duke Oldrich]] in retribution for Mieszko's father [[Boles\u0142aw I of Poland|Boles\u0142aw]]'s blinding [[Boleslaus III, Duke of Bohemia|Duke Boleslaus III]], Oldrich's brother, thirty years earlier. Shortly after taking power, Bezprym sent the [[Polish Crown Jewels|Polish royal crown and regalia]] to Conrad, officially renouncing the title \"king\" in favor of the traditional title \"duke\" and accepting the overlordship of the Empire over Poland.<ref>Boshof (2008), p. 71</ref> The Royal crown and regalia were delivered by Mieszko II's wife, [[Richeza of Lotharingia|Queen Richeza]].<ref name=\"Halfond2016\"/>\n\nBezprym's reign was short. Bezprym's extreme cruelty caused his half-brother [[Otto Boles\u0142awowic]] to lead a conspiracy. Bezprym's own men murdered him in spring 1032, created a [[power vacuum]] in Poland. Conrad responded by holding an [[hoftag|assembly]] at [[Merseburg]] in 1033 to address the situation. Conrad's wife, the Empress [[Gisela of Swabia]], interceded on Mieszko's behalf and requested he be freed from imprisonment in Bohemia and allowed to regain the Polish throne. Under the terms of the [[Treaty of Merseburg]], Conrad divided Poland between Mieszko, Otto, and another half brother Detric. Mieszko was allowed to retain the title Duke and nominal authority over all of Poland. With a strong central leader to guide it, the treaty significantly increased the Empire's influence over Poland.<ref name=\"Knefelkamp 2002, p. 137\">Knefelkamp (2002), p. 137</ref><ref name=\"Boshof 2008, p. 72\">Boshof (2008), p. 72</ref>\n\nThe division was short-lived: in 1033 Otto was killed by one of his own men, and Mieszko II took his domains. Shortly after, Mieszko expelled Detric, reuniting the whole country in his hands. Though Mieszko regained his former power, he still had to fight against the nobility and his own subjects. Mieszko did not accept Bezprym's renunciation of the Polish crown and continued to style himself as \"King\" instead of \"Duke\". Mieszko II died soon after in 1034, and upon his death, a [[Pagan reaction in Poland]] erupted. Subsequently, his wife [[Richeza of Lotharingia|Richeza]] and son [[Casimir I of Poland|Casimir I]] fled to Germany.<ref name=\"Knefelkamp 2002, p. 137\"/><ref name=\"Boshof 2008, p. 72\"/>\n\n===Relations with Eastern Europe===\n\n====Bohemia====\nThe [[Duchy of Bohemia]] was incorporated into the Holy Roman Empire in 1004 during the [[German-Polish War (1002\u20131018)|German-Polish Wars]], which stretched from 1002 to 1018. [[Emperor Henry II]] installed [[Jarom\u00edr, Duke of Bohemia|Jaromir]] as [[Duke of Bohemia]] and promised protection against Polish aggression in return for incorporation. Jaromir ruled only a smaller territory, however, as Poland occupied the traditional Czech territories of [[Moravia]], [[Silesia]], [[Lesser Poland]] and [[Lusatia]]. In 1012, Jaromir was deposed by his brother [[Old\u0159ich, Duke of Bohemia|Oldrich]], who assumed the Bohemian throne for himself. Following the resumption of hostilities between the Empire and Poland in 1028, Oldrich went on the offensive against Poland, reconquering Moravia by 1029, which helped to stabilize his duchy. The war ended in 1031 when Polish King [[Mieszko II of Poland|Mieszko II]] surrendered to Conrad. In the civil war which followed, Meiszko was forced to flee Poland for Bohemia, where Oldrich had him imprisoned and castrated in revenge for the torture Meiszko's father, [[Boles\u0142aw I of Poland]], inflicted upon [[Boleslaus III, Duke of Bohemia|Duke Boleslaus III]], Oldrich's brother, thirty years before.<ref name=\"Prague09\">{{cite book|author1=Cosmas (of Prague)|author2=Cosmas of Prague|author3=C\u00f4me de Prague|title=The Chronicle of the Czechs|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZG7igBN41oUC&pg=PA105|year=2009|publisher=CUA Press|isbn=978-0-8132-1570-9|pages=105\u2013}}</ref>\n\nPoland was unable to stabilize in the wake of Mieszko's exile, forcing Conrad to convene an assembly in July 1033 to issue the [[Treaty of Merseburg]] which restored Meiszko to the Polish throne. Conrad summoned Oldrich to appear to the assembly, but Oldrich refused. His absence raised the ire of the Emperor and Conrad, busy with securing his succession to the Burgundy throne, charged his son [[Henry III, Holy Roman Emperor|Duke Henry of Bavaria]] with punishing the recalcitrant Bohemian. At age 17, Henry's march on Bohemia was his first independent military command. The expedition was complete success, with Henry deposing Oldrich and restoring his brother Jaromir to the Bohemian throne, with Oldrich's son [[Bretislaus I, Duke of Bohemia|Bretislaus I]] appointed as Count of [[Moravia]]. Oldrich was imprisoned in Bavaria but by 1034 was pardoned and allowed to return to Bohemia.<ref name=\"Wolverton2012\">{{cite book|author=Lisa Wolverton|title=Hastening Toward Prague: Power and Society in the Medieval Czech Lands|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FeFACISbhCgC&pg=PP6|date=9 October 2012|publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press|isbn=0-8122-0422-0|pages=6\u2013}}</ref>\n\nOldrich deposed and blinded Jaromir, reclaimed the Bohemian throne, and exiled his son. While the reason for the conflict between father and son has been lost, it is believed Bretislaus supported Jaromir over his father. Oldrich died suddenly on November 9, 1034, allowing Bretislaus to return from exile. Though Jaromir was offered the throne, he declined in favor of his nephew.

[[Odo II, Count of Blois|Count Odo II of Blois]], who had strong family ties with Rudolph, also emphasized his right in the succession. Conrad II met Rudolph III in August 1027 near [[Basel]] to settle the dispute.

Conrad rarely intervened in its affairs following his coronation, returning only in 1038 to announce his son [[Henry III, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry]] as the kingdom's future ruler. Of central significance in the conquest of Burgundy was to augment the influence and dignity of the Emperor to the benefit of the Empire.

Despite some opposition, the Burgundian and Proven\u00e7al nobles paid homage to Conrad in [[Z\u00fcrich]] in 1034. This Kingdom of Burgundy, later known as the [[Kingdom of Arles]] under Conrad's successors, corresponded to most of the southeastern quarter of modern France and included western Switzerland, the Franche-Comt\u00e9, and Dauphin\u00e9.

{{nowrap|'''Conrad the Elder'''}} and {{nowrap|'''Conrad the Salic'''}}, was [[Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor]] of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] from 1027 until his death in 1039. The first of a succession of four [[Salian dynasty|Salian]] emperors, who reigned for one century until 1125, Conrad also served as [[King of Germany]] from 1024, [[King of Italy]] from 1026, and [[King of Burgundy|King of Burgundy (Arelat)]] from 1033.\n\nThe son of [[Franconia]]n count [[Henry of Speyer]] (also Henry of Worms) and [[Adelaide of Metz]] of the ''Matfriding dynasty'', that had ruled the [[Duchy of Lorraine]] from 959 until 972, Conrad inherited the titles of count of [[Speyer]] and [[Worms, Germany|Worms]] during childhood after his father had died around the year 990. He extended his influence beyond his inherited lands, as he came into favor of the [[Princes of the Holy Roman Empire|princes]] of the kingdom. When the imperial [[Ottonian dynasty|dynastic line]] was left without a successor after [[Henry II, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Henry II's]] death in 1024, on September 4 an assembly of the [[Princes of the Holy Roman Empire|imperial princes]] appointed the 34 year-old Conrad king (''Rex romanorum'').{{sfn|Wolfram|2006|p=18}}<ref name=\"Weinfurter99\"/>\n\nConrad II largely continued the political course, the ''Renovatio regni Francorum'' of his [[Ottonian dynasty|Ottonian]] predecessor Henry II regarding the role of the Church and the status and affairs of Italy. He proceeded to evolve the [[Proprietary church]] as a basis for imperial power, preferring to appoint clerics over secular lords for important offices throughout the empire. Like Henry II before him, he insisted on his feudal claim (''Honor Imperii''), yet granted Italy a high degree of self-governance, near complete economic autonomy and recognized and respected the political importance and influence of the city of [[Rome]] and its [[Roman Curia|curia]] in particular.<ref name=boni/><ref name=\"Blumenthal1988\">{{cite book|author=Uta-Renate Blumenthal|title=The Investiture Controversy: Church and Monarchy from the Ninth to the Twelfth Century|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0tZhHot9CuEC&pg=PA45|year=1988|publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press|isbn=0-8122-1386-6|pages=45\u2013}}</ref> His reign marked a high point of medieval imperial rule during a relatively peaceful period for the empire.

His son, [[Conrad, Duke of Lorraine|Conrad the Red]], succeeded him as Count in 941. [[Otto I, Holy Roman Emperor|King Otto I]] (the future [[Holy Roman Emperor]]) elevated him to [[Duke of Lorraine]] in 944. He subsequently married [[Liutgard of Saxony (died 953)|Liutgarde]], one of Otto's daughters in 947 and rose to become one of the king's closest allies. The relationship, however deteriorated, when Otto refused to honor a peace treaty Conrad, as Otto's representative, had negotiated with [[Berengar II of Italy]]. Conrad also resented the growing influence of Otto's brother [[Henry I, Duke of Bavaria|Henry I of Bavaria]], whom he regarded a threat to his position. In 953 Conrad joined the king's son [[Liudolf, Duke of Swabia|Liudolf]] in rebellion against Otto. The rebellion was crushed and Conrad was stripped of his ducal title. Conrad and Otto eventually reconciled. Conrad fought alongside Otto and fell in the decisive [[Battle of Lechfeld]] in 955 that put an end to the [[Hungarian invasions of Europe|Hungarian invasions into Europe]]. Conrad was succeeded as Count of Worms in 956 by his son [[Otto of Worms]], who was also the grandson of Otto I. In between 965 and 970 Otto of Worms' first son and Conrad II's father, [[Henry of Speyer]]  was born, of whom only very little is known. He died the age of 20 between 985 and 990.  Conrad II's mother was [[Adelaide of Metz]]. After Henry's death, Adelaide married a Frankish nobleman and the relationship with Conrad declined.<ref name=urku>{{cite web |url= https://www.dmgh.de/de/fs1/object/display/bsb00000448_00011.html?zoom=0.75&leftTab=toc&sortIndex=030:040:0004:010:00:00 |title= Konrad II  |publisher= Monumenta Germaniae Historica  | date= | author= | accessdate= January 29, 2020 }}</ref>\n\nIn 978 [[Otto II, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Otto II]] appointed his nephew Otto of Worms as [[Duke of Carinthia]]. He succeeded the rebellious Duke [[Henry III, Duke of Bavaria|Henry I of Carinthia]], who had been deposed after the [[War of the Three Henries (977\u2013978)|War of the Three Henries]]. Upon receiving the ducal title, however, Otto lost his countship at Worms, which was given to Bishop [[Hildebald]], emperor Otto II's imperial chancellor. When Otto II died suddenly in 983, his infant son [[Otto III, Holy Roman Emperor|Otto III]] succeeded him, with his mother [[Theophanu]] serving as regent. Theophanu sought to reconcile the imperial house with Henry I, restoring him as Duke of Carinthia in 985, with Otto of Worms allowed to regain his ancestral position as Count of Worms. However, Otto was allowed to style himself \"Duke of Worms\" and his original territory was expanded according to his rank. Otto of Worms loyally served the new Emperor and received the [[March of Verona]] in 955, as the actual Duchy of Carinthia was given to [[Henry II, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry IV of Bavaria]]. In 996, Otto III invested Otto of Worms' son Bruno as [[Pope Gregory V]]. When Emperor Otto III died in 1002, both Otto of Worms, Conrad's grandfather, and Henry IV became eligible for Kingship of Germany. In a compromise, Otto withdrew and in return received the Duchy of Carinthia from the newly elected king Henry IV, who ruled as ''Henry II of Germany''. As a result, Otto of Worms renounced his fiefs at Worms to [[Burchard of Worms|Bishop Burchard of Worms]], a long-time political rival.<ref name=\"Austin2017\">{{cite book|author=Greta Austin|title=Shaping Church Law Around the Year 1000: The Decretum of Burchard of Worms|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wgokDwAAQBAJ&pg=PT4|date=15 May 2017|publisher=Taylor & Francis|isbn=978-1-351-90055-3|pages=4\u2013}}</ref> \n\nAfter the early death of his uncle Duke [[Conrad I, Duke of Carinthia|Conrad I of Carinthia]] the Elder Conrad's infant son, [[Conrad II, Duke of Carinthia|Conrad the Younger]], was named Count of Worms by emperor Henry II while the Duchy of Carinthia passed to [[Adalbero of Eppenstein]] due to Conrad the Younger's infancy.

Gisela had first been married to [[Brun I, Count of Brunswick|Count Bruno I of Brunswick]] the same year. Following Bruno's death around 1010, Gisela had married [[Ernest I, Duke of Swabia|Ernest I]] of the [[House of Babenberg]].{{sfn|Wolfram|2006|p=32}} Through this marriage, Ernest I inherited the [[Duchy of Swabia]] upon the death of Gisela's brother [[Herman III, Duke of Swabia|Duke Herman III of Swabia]] in 1012. The marriage produced two sons: [[Ernest II, Duke of Swabia|Ernest II]] and Herman. After the death of Ernest I in 1015, Emperor Henry II named Ernest II as Duke of Swabia. As Gisela's new husband, Conrad hoped to serve as regent for his minor stepson in the administration of the duchy, seeing it as an opportunity to increase his own rank and subsequently make a claim for his own duchy. Emperor Henry II blocked this attempt by placing the guardianship of Ernest II, and regency over Swabia, in the hands of [[Poppo (Archbishop of Trier)|Archbishop Poppo of Trier]] in 1016. This action further strained the already rough relationship between the imperial [[Ottonian dynasty|House of Otto]] and the [[Salian dynasty|Salian family]].{{sfn|Wolfram|2006|p=35}}\n\nConrad II's hopes to obtain his own duchy failed, but the marriage to Gisela brought him wealth. Her mother, [[Gerberga of Burgundy]], was the daughter of reigning [[Kingdom of Arles|Burgundian King]] [[Conrad of Burgundy]] and granddaughter of the late [[Carolingian Empire|Frankish King]] [[Louis IV of France|Louis IV]]. Gisela also claimed descent from [[Charlemagne]] through both her mother and father. The marriage was opposed by many because of the familial relationship shared by Gisela and Conrad. Both were descendants of  King [[Henry the Fowler|Henry I]] - Conrad in the fifth generation and Gisela in the fourth. According to [[canon law]], marriage was forbidden among relatives from the first to the seventh generation. Though Conrad's marriage differed little from the usual practice of the time, strict canonists frowned upon the marriage and [[Henry II, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Henry II]] relied to this violation of canonical law when he forced Conrad into temporary exile. During this exile, Gisela bore Conrad a son, the future emperor [[Henry III, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry III]], on October 28, 1017. Conrad and Emperor Henry II eventually reconciled and he returned to Germany.<ref name=\"M\u00f6llerAmmerich2015\"/>\n\n==Reign as King==\n\n===Royal election===\nEmperor Henry II died in 1024. Childless, Henry's death brought the [[Ottonian dynasty]], which had ruled Germany since 919, to an end. Without a clear successor as [[King of Germany]], Henry's widow [[Cunigunde of Luxembourg]] served as regent while the German dukes gathered to elect a new king. Cunigunde was assisted by her brothers [[Dietrich I of Metz|Bishop Dietrich I of Metz]] and [[Henry V, Duke of Bavaria|Duke Henry V of Bavaria]]. [[Aribo (archbishop of Mainz)|Archbiship Aribo of Mainz]], the [[Primate of Germany]], also assisted Cunigunde.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.catholic-hierarchy.org/bishop/bmagon.html |title= Archbishop Aribo di Magonza  |publisher= Catholic-Hierarchy  | date=July 24, 2017 | author= | accessdate= January 30, 2020 }}</ref>\n\n[[File:Konr\u00e1d2.jpg|thumb|left|Conrad&nbsp;II, depicted in the Chronicle of [[Ekkehard von Aura]]]]\n\nOn September 4, 1024, the German princes gathered at ''Kamba'', a historical name for an area on the east banks of the [[Rhine River]] opposite the modern German town of [[Oppenheim]]. Now the location of ''Kamba'' is marked with a small equestrian statue of Conrad II. The chronicler and Conrad's [[chaplain]], [[Wipo of Burgundy]] attended the meeting and documented the event. Archbishop Aribo presided over the assembly. Conrad presented himself as a candidate for election, as did his younger cousin [[Conrad II, Duke of Carinthia|Conrad the Younger]].

The [[Duchy of Saxony]] adopted a neutral strategy while the [[Duchy of Lorraine]] favored the younger Conrad. A majority of the assembled princes favored the elder Conrad, as the father of a seven-year-old son implied a more stable dynastic future for the kingdom. As president of the assembly, Archbishop Aribo cast the first vote and supported the elder Conrad. He was joined by the other clerics in support of him. The secular dukes then cast their votes for the elder Conrad as well.

Conrad then moved north to Saxony, visiting [[Adelaide I, Abbess of Quedlinburg|Abbess Adelaide I of Quedlinburg]] and [[Sophia I, Abbess of Gandersheim|Abbess Sophia I of Gandersheim]], both were daughters of the former [[Otto II, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Otto II]]. They supported Conrad, which helped to rally the Saxon nobility behind Conrad. During [[Christmas]] at [[Minden]], the Saxon nobles, led by [[Bernard II, Duke of Saxony|Duke Bernard II]], officially recognized him as royal sovereign. He in turn had vowed to respect and honor the ancient Saxon customs and laws. Conrad and Gisela would remain in Saxony until March 1025, when they moved on to the [[Duchy of Swabia]], celebrating [[Easter]] at [[Augsburg]] and then proceeded on to the [[Duchy of Bavaria]], spending the feast of [[Pentecost]] at [[Regensburg]]. The royal couple finally visited [[Zurich]], where after ten months they ended their royal tour. Conrad then entered Burgundy in order to renew the royal claim, that in 1016, Emperor Henry II had forced upon the childless Burgundian King [[Rudolph III of Burgundy|Rudolph III]] to name him as his heir.<ref name=\"Wolfram2\"/>\n\nConrad had to address the longstanding ''[[Gandersheim Conflict]]'' upon assuming the German throne. The decade-old dispute dated back to the reign of [[Otto III, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Otto III]] at the unsettled business of who controls [[Gandersheim Abbey]] and its estates. Both the [[Archbishop of Mainz]] and the [[Bishop of Hildesheim]] claimed authority over the Abbey, that also included the right to invest and anoint the Abbey's nuns. Though Otto III had once eased the tensions among the warring parties by declaring that both bishops would be entitled to anoint the Abbess and her sisters, the conflict still lingered. [[Aribo (archbishop of Mainz)|Archbishop Aribo of Mainz]], the new [[Primate of Germany]], counted on Conrad, who was indebted to Aribo for his support during the royal election. In January 1027, the king summoned a [[synod]] at [[Frankfurt]] to end the dispute, but a conclusion could not be reached. He called another synod in September 1028, which also failed. Only a third synod in 1030 solved the conflict when [[Gotthard of Hildesheim|Bishop Gotthard of Hildesheim]] renounced his claims in favor of Aribo.<ref name=\"Wolfram2\">{{cite book|author=Herwig Wolfram|title=Conrad II, 990-1039: Emperor of Three Kingdoms - The Dispute over Gandersheim p.95 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zuKIX5g6MgoC&pg=PA443|date=1 November 2010|publisher=Penn State Press|isbn=0-271-04818-2|pages=443\u2013}}</ref><ref name=\"Davids2002\">{{cite book|author=Adelbert Davids|title=The Empress Theophano: Byzantium and the West at the Turn of the First Millennium|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=N9Nf-GHTgnEC&pg=PA92|date=15 August 2002|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-52467-4|pages=92\u2013}}</ref>\n\nDuring his royal tour at Augsburg, Conrad and his younger cousin [[Conrad II, Duke of Carinthia|Conrad the Younger]] engaged into an argument, that although not entirely clear, was related to the younger Conrad's demands of yet unpaid compensation, king Conrad had promised him for withdrawing from the 1024 election. Both men must have reconciled sometimes before September 1027 after which Conrad the Younger no longer opposed Conrad II.{{sfn|Wolfram|2006|p=75}}\n\n===Unrest in Italy===\n[[File:Iron Crown.JPG|thumb|300px|Following his expedition into Italy in early 1026, Conrad II was crowned with the [[Iron Crown of Lombardy]] as the [[King of the Lombards]].]]\nIn Bavaria, Conrad came into contact with members of the Italian ruling elite for the first time. In June 1025, bishops from [[Northern Italy]], led by [[Aribert (archbishop of Milan)|Archbishop Aribert of Milan]], crossed the Alps in order to pay homage to Conrad. In exchange for certain administrative privileges, Aribert agreed to crown Conrad [[Iron Crown of Lombardy|King of Italy]]. However,the situation in Italy had become increasingly unstable after the death of the Henry II. Amidst occasional riots many Italian aristocrats demanded the secession of the [[Kingdom of Italy]] from the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. The local aristocrats and merchants now considered the Frankish role of protecttors against the Maurian and Byzantine threat to be obsolete. The Italian throne was now viewed as vacant and not available for Conrad's automatic succession as a matter of right. Instead, the secular nobles had offered the Italian crown to the [[House of Capet|Capetian]] [[Robert II of France|King Robert II of France]] and his son [[Hugh Magnus]]. After the offer was rejected, they approached [[William V, Duke of Aquitaine|Duke William V of Aquitaine]], who, initially intrigued by the offer, rejected as well.{{sfn|Bury|1922|p=264}}\n\nWhen the news of Henry's death spread, the citizens of [[Pavia]] revolted and destroyed the local imperial palace of the [[Ostrogothic Kingdom|Ostrogothic King]] [[Theodoric the Great]], built during the 5th century.<ref name=\"Morgan-Owenson1821\">{{cite book|author=Sydney Morgan-Owenson|title=Italy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lupQAAAAcAAJ&pg=PA200|year=1821|publisher=H.

According to Wipo of Burgundy, the Italian kingship was not compatible with the German thron. Italy was a separate nation from Germany with its own identity. The emissaries justified the actions of their fellow citizens by claiming that Pavia had always been loyal to the Italian king, as long as the king was alive and present, and that the revolt had taken place when the Italian throne was vacant. Conrad rejected the argument, that just as a ship remains devoted to its captain after his death, the Empire remains imperial property after the death of an emperor. The kingdom of Italy, according to Conrad, belonged to the empire as a matter of legal right. In his ''[[Constitutio de feudis]]'' (\"Edict on the Benefices of the Italian Kingdom\") of 1038 he would determine his regulations of the feudal contracts in Italy.<ref name=\"Stock1983\">{{cite book|author=Brian Stock|title=The Implications of Literacy: Written Language and Models of Interpretation in the Eleventh and Twelfth Centuries p. 156|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6Ves8Li9LH8C|year=1983|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=0-691-10227-9}}</ref> Conrad also declared that the Ostrogothic palace was property of the Empire and therefore the king had the right to punish those responsible for its destruction. The Pavian embassy returned to Italy in opposition to [[Salian dynasty|Salian]] rule.<ref name=boni/>\n\nIn February 1026, Conrad assembled a large army of armored knights for an expedition into Italy, including troops commanded by both [[Aribo (archbishop of Mainz)|Archbishop Aribo of Mainz]] and [[Pilgrim (archbishop of Cologne)|Archbishop Pilgrim of Cologne]]. Conrad's army moved south and a contingent besieged Pavia and blocked all trade in the area, as he continued his campaign. By March 1026, Conrad arrived in [[Milan]] and was crowned with the [[Iron Crown of the Lombards]] by [[Aribert (archbishop of Milan)|Archbishop Aribert of Milan]] as [[King of the Lombards]]. From Milan, Conrad traveled to [[Vercelli]], where he celebrated [[Easter]] with the aged [[Leo of Vercelli|Bishop Leo of Vercelli]], who had been a chief advisor to the late [[Otto III, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Otto III]]. When Leo died a few days later, Archbishop Aribert became the chief supporter of the [[Salian dynasty]] in Italy. With Conrad's assistance, Aribert rose to highest ranking religious office in Italy and oversaw the expansion of the [[Basilica of Sant'Ambrogio]] in Milan. In June 1026, Conrad lead his army to [[Ravenna]], but quartering his soldiers among the Ravennese population caused tensions in the city. Conrad then marched north to mitigate the risk the summer heat might pose to his army. In autumn Conrad left his summer camp in the [[Po valley]] and marched to the Burgundian border. Conrad then celebrated [[Christmas]] at [[Ivrea]]. By the end of winter, the Italian aristocrats voluntarily ended their opposition to Conrad's reign. Pavia, however, remained in revolt until early 1027 when [[Odilo of Cluny|Abbot Odilo of Cluny]] brokered a peace deal between the city and Conrad.<ref name=\"Halfond2016\">{{cite book|author=Gregory I.

Rudolph's attendance marked an improvement in the relationship between Burgundy and the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. During the seven-day coronation ceremony, a rank dispute between the archbishops of Milan and Ravenna arose, with Conrad deciding in favor of Milan. Following the synod, Conrad traveled south to receive [[Homage (feudal)|homage]] from the southern Italian states of [[Principality of Capua]], the [[Principality of Salerno]], and the [[Duchy of Benevento]].<ref name=\"Weinfurter19\">{{cite book|author=Stefan Weinfurter|title=The Salian Century: Main Currents in an Age of Transition|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ChuTjtrf9xIC&pg=PA228|year=1999|publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press|isbn=0-8122-3508-8|page=28\u2013}}</ref>\n\nAfter his coronation, Conrad issued decrees to reorganize the monasteries and dioceses of Italy with the particular goal of bringing the church at [[Venice]] under Imperial control (see the ''[[Schism of the Three Chapters]]''). On April 6, 1027, at a [[synod]] held in the [[Lateran Basilica]] with [[Pope John XIX]], the Emperor resolved the dispute in favor of Old-Aquileia. The [[Patriarchate of Aquileia|Patriarch of Aquleia]] [[Poppo of Treffen|Poppo]] had been a loyal supporter of Emperor Henry II, who appointed him as Patriarch in 1020 during the Emperor's campaign to reassert his authority in Italy. Conrad's action placed the church at Grado under Poppo's authority, securing Poppo's loyalty by making him the Emperor's top official in northern Italy. The synod ended the independence of the Grado church and limited the political autonomy of Venice. In so doing, Conrad broke with the policies of his predecessors and revoked Venice's privileged trading status.<ref name=\"Schutz2010\"/>\n\nToward the end of May 1027, Conrad returned north to Germany to attend the funeral of [[Henry V, Duke of Bavaria|Duke Henry V of Bavaria]] at [[Regensburg]]. With the [[Duchy of Bavaria]] left vacant, Conrad asserted his right to name a next duke as a matter of [[royal prerogative]], taking the unprecedented decision of naming his 10-year-old son [[Henry III, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry]] as Duke of Bavaria despite the existence of candidates with a better claim to the Duchy. Never before had the Bavarian Duchy passed to a non-member of the Bavarian ducal family.\n\nThe young prince assumed the Bavarian dignity on 24 June 1027. Following Henry's appointment, Conrad held court at Regensburg and issued a decree requiring an accounting of all imperial property in the duchy. This required the various counts and bishops to report to Conrad all property they possessed in their castles and abbeys that belonged to the Emperor. Even the [[Dowager Empress]] [[Cunigunde of Luxembourg]] was required to report to Conrad, with the Emperor even claiming Cunegonde's ''[[wittum]]'' (money and property left to her by her late husband Emperor Henry II) as belonging to him. Conrad's promotion of imperial authority over the ducal succession and his claims to property throughout Bavaria caused tension between him and the German aristocracy, who viewed Conrad's actions as infringing upon their privileges.{{sfn|Wolfram|2006|p=114}}\n\n===Uprising in Swabia===\n[[File:MPano 07.jpg|thumb|200px|left|The [[Konstanz Minster]], seat of the [[Bishop of Constance]]]]\n[[File:Oberfalkenstein.jpg|thumb|200px|left|ruins of the ''Upper Falkenstein Castle'', 2008]]\nIn 1025, [[Ernest II, Duke of Swabia|Duke Ernest II of Swabia]], Conrad's stepson from his marriage to [[Gisela of Swabia]], rebelled against his stepfather when he was elected king of Germany. By 1026, Conrad had defeated the resistance and Ernest submitted to his reign. Due to the intervention of his mother Gisela, Ernest was allowed to accompany Conrad on his expedition to Italy in 1026. During the expedition, the rebellion led by [[Conrad II, Duke of Carinthia|Conrad of Carinthia]] and [[Welf II, Count of Swabia|Count Welf II of Swabia]] continued. Conrad had named [[Bruno of Augsburg|Bishop Bruno of Augsburg]] regent of Germany while he marched south to Italy.  When Bruno was defeated by the rebels, Conrad sent Ernest back to Germany in September 1026 to end the revolt. When Ernest returned, he joined the opposition and rebelled against Conrad again.\n\nIn 1027 Conrad returned to Germany after his imperial coronation and held court at [[Augsburg]], calling upon the rebels to surrender. Ernest, trusting in the number and fidelity of his vassals, rejected the peace offer and appealed to his Swabian counts to join him in the rebellion. According to [[Wipo of Burgundy]], the counts refused, stating that while they had sworn loyalty to Ernest, they would not rebel against their Emperor. Without the support of the Swabian counts, Ernest, Conrad of Carinthia and Count Welf surrendered to Conrad at [[Worms, Germany|Worms]] on September 9, 1027, ending the rebellion. Conrad stripped Ernest of his ducal title and imprisoned him at [[Giebichenstein Castle]] in [[Duchy of Saxony|Saxony]]. Gisela supported Conrad against her son, but did not want Ernest to be entirely humiliated. As a result of his mother's intervention, Conrad allowed Ernest to retain his title while imprisoned, with Gisela serving as regent over the duchy.<ref name=\"Schutz2010\"/>\n\nIn 1028, after Conrad's son [[Henry III, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry]] was crowned in Aachen as King of Germany, Gisela again intervened on Ernest's behalf. Conrad pardoned Ernest and released him from prison in 1028, but Gisela retained regency over Swabia. Ernest served as duke in name only. On Easter 1030, Conrad offered to restore Ernest his full powers as Duke of Swabia if he would crack down on the Emperor's enemies there. Ernest's refusal, especially against his friend Count Werner of Kyburg, resulted in his final downfall. Conrad stripped his stepson of his title, declared him a public enemy, and had him [[excommunicated]]. Even his mother Gisela did not come to his rescue. Within a few months, both Ernest and Werner, who had retreated to ''Falkenstein Castle'', south of modern [[Schramberg]] in the [[Black Forest]] were killed in a battle against a contingent of the [[Bishop of Constance]]. The fall of Ernest greatly weakened the sovereignty of Swabia. Conrad appointed Ernest's younger brother [[Herman IV, Duke of Swabia|Herman]] as new Swabian prince. As Herman was still an infant, the Bishop of Constance was assigned his regent. Eight years later in 1038, Herman died and Conrad installed his own son Henry as duke, securing imperial control over the duchy.<ref name=\"Schutz2010\"/>\n\n===Conflict with Adalbero===\nConrad had to enforce his [[royal prerogative]]s in the [[Duchy of Carinthia]] and the [[Duchy of Swabia]]. [[Adalbero, Duke of Carinthia|Duke Adalbero of Carinthia]] had been appointed as duke in 1012 under Emperor Henry II and remained loyal to imperial authority, supporting Conrad's election as German king in 1024. At a [[synod]] in [[Frankfurt]] in September 1027, Conrad attempted to resolve the decades' long ''Gandersheim Conflict''. Adalbero accompanied the Emperor and acted as his sword-bearer during the proceeding, indicating Conrad's trust in him. From 1028 on, Adalbero governed his Duchy as an independent state.\n\nIn particular, he attempted to conduct peaceful relations with the [[Stephen I of Hungary|King Stephen I]] of the [[Kingdom of Hungary (1000\u20131301)|Kingdom of Hungary]]. Under Emperor Henry II, who was the brother-in-law to Stephen, relations between the Empire and Hungary had been friendly. Upon Henry's death in 1024, Conrad adopted a more aggressive policy, prompting border raids into the Empire from Hungary. The raids particularly affected Adalbero's domain of Carinthia, which shared a long, eastern border with Hungary.{{sfn|Gy\u00f6rffy|1994|p= 140}}{{sfn|Makk|2001|p=45}}\n\nConrad summoned Adalbero to court at [[Bamberg]] on 18 May 1035, to answer an indictment of [[treason]] for his actions regarding Hungary. In the presence of the German dukes, Conrad demanded that Adalbero be stripped of all his titles and lands. The dukes hesitated and demanded that Conrad's son [[Henry III, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry]], the Germany's co-King and Conrad's designated successor, join the assembly before a decision was made. Henry refused to depose Adalbero, citing an earlier agreement with Adelbero to be his ally in negotiating a settlement between him and his father. Conrad resorted to exhortations, pleas, and threats to convince Henry to support Adalbero's deposition. Henry's support was soon followed by that of the other dukes. Conrad then ordered Adalbero to be removed as Duke and sentenced him and his son to [[exile]]. After attacking Conrad's allies in Carinthia, Adalbero fled to his mother's estates in [[Ebersberg]] in the [[Duchy of Bavaria]], where he remained until his death in 1039. The duchy of Carinthia remained unoccupied until February 2, 1035, when Conrad named his cousin [[Conrad II, Duke of Carinthia|Conrad the Younger]] as the new duke. With the appointment, the three southern German duchies of Swabia, Bavaria, and Carinthia were all under the control of Emperor Conrad through his family members (his stepson Herman in Swabia, his son Henry in Bavaria, and his cousin Conrad in Carinthia).{{sfn|Wolfram|2006|p=84}}\n\nControl of the southern duchies allowed Conrad to continue the process begun under the [[Ottonian dynasty]], centralizing the Emperors authority over the Empire at the expense of the regional dukes. Conrad broke with Ottonian tradition, however, in favoring a more strict means of controlling rebellious vassals. Whereas the Ottonians followed a policy of informal public submission and subsequent reconciliation, Conrad used treason trials to declare rebels as \"public enemies\" to legitimize his subsequent harsh treatment, as he had done with [[Ernest II, Duke of Swabia|Ernest II of Swabia]] and Adalbero. The nobles saw use of these treason trials not as mere power shifts in favor of the Emperor, but as a cruel breach of German tradition.{{sfn|Wolfram|2006|p=88}}\n\n===Policy towards the Church===\n[[File:Bischof Poppo von Trier.png|thumb|[[Prince-bishop]] [[Poppo (archbishop of Trier)|Poppo von Babenberg]] was [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Trier|archbishop of Trier]] and imperial prince of the [[Electorate of Trier]]]]\nConrad continued the [[Ottonian dynasty]]'s [[Imperial Church System]] - a policy of using the German Church as a vehicle for imperial control. Beginning in the 950s, the Ottonians had favored Church officials over secular nobles for appointment to the Empire's most important offices. Claiming \"[[divine right of king|divine right]]\" to rule the Empire, the Ottonians increasingly viewed themselves as [[defender of the faith|protectors of the Church]] and thus demanded loyalty from the Church officials.<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-ecclesiastical-history/article/imperial-church-system-of-the-ottonian-and-salian-rulers-a-reconsideration/8B8887F785FC72BFD48A4A5DDF8A49C2 |title= The \u2018Imperial Church System\u2019 of the Ottonian and Salian Rulers: a Reconsideration|publisher= Cambridge Org | date=March 25, 2011   | author=Timothy Reuter   | accessdate= January 27, 2020 }}</ref> In return, the various bishoprics and abbeys of the Empire were granted extensive landholdings and secular authority, providing immunity from the jurisdiction of the secular nobles.

Under royal service, the bishops and abbots were required to provide hospitality and accommodations to the Emperor and his court when he arrived. It also required the Church officials to act as quasi-bureaucracy for the Empire. Under military service, the Church was required to supply soldiers for the Emperors' army or to act as diplomats at his direction. Conrad energetically continued this tradition.<ref name=\"Schutz2010\"/><ref name=\"Bernhardt2002\">{{cite book|author=John W.

Conrad and the other members of the [[Salian dynasty]] had little interest in the founding of new monasteries. Through their hundred-year dynasty, the Salians only founded one: [[Limburg Abbey]] which was converted from a fortress to a monastery in 1025.  The Ottonians established at least eight in their hundred-year reign. Additionally, the Ottonians were active in the establishment of Church affairs, but Conrad was uninterested, only calling five [[synods]] during his reign and usually only to restore peace. Conrad's decisions on Church policy were often left to his wife [[Gisela of Swabia]]. When [[Aribo, Archbishop of Mainz|Archbishop Aribo of Mainz]], [[Primate of Germany]], died in 1031, Conrad considered both [[Bardo (bishop)|Abbot Bardo]] of [[Hersfeld Abbey]] and the renowned [[theologian]] [[Wazo of Li\u00e8ge]], then serving as the dean of the [[cathedral chapter]] for the [[Prince-Bishopric of Li\u00e8ge|Bishop of Liege]]. Though Conrad favored Wazo to lead the German Church as Archbishop and Primate, Gisela convinced him to appoint Bardo instead.<ref name=\"M\u00f6llerAmmerich2015\"/>\n\n===Relations with Poland===\n\n====War with Mieszko====\n[[File:Polska 992 - 1025.png|thumb|350px|right|The [[Duchies of Poland|Duchy of Poland]] at its greatest extent under [[Boleslaw I of Poland|Boles\u0142aw I]] and his son [[Mieszko II of Poland|Mieszko II]].]]\n\n[[Boles\u0142aw I Chrobry|Duke Boles\u0142aw I of Poland]] warred with [[Henry II, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Henry II]] three times during the [[German-Polish War (1002\u20131018)|German-Polish Wars from 1002 to 1018]]. In January 1018, Henry II and Boles\u0142aw I signed a peace treaty, known as the [[Peace of Bautzen]],<ref name=Knefelkamp123>Knefelkamp (2002), p. 125</ref> in which the Empire and Poland declared a permanent peace with Boles\u0142aw recognizing Henry II as his nominal feudal lord.<ref name=cmh>Previte-orton, pg. 451</ref> In return, Henry II granted to Boles\u0142aw lands on the Empire's eastern border. To seal the peace, Boles\u0142aw I, a widower, reinforced his dynastic bonds with the German nobility by marrying [[Oda of Meissen]], daughter of the Saxon Margrave Eckard I of Meissen. Empire and Poland remained at peace for the remainder of Henry's reign. Henry's death in 1024 gave Boles\u0142aw an opportunity to increase his own power. Boles\u0142aw took advantage of the interregnum in Germany and crowned himself king on [[Easter]], April 25, 1025. Boles\u0142aw was thus the first Polish king as his predecessors had been considered mere \"dukes\" by both the Empire and the Pope in Rome. Boles\u0142aw died within two months of the coronation, most likely due to an illness. Boles\u0142aw's son, [[Mieszko II Lambert]], succeeded him as King, being crowned on Christmas Day 1025. Upon assuming the Polish throne, Mieszko expelled his older half-brother [[Bezprym]] and his younger brother [[Otto Boles\u0142awowic]]. Otto went to Germany to seek Conrad's protection.{{sfn|Wolfram|2006|p=209}}\n\nConrad considered the assumption of the title \"king\" by Mieszko an act of war and a disregard of his imperial authority, but had to address domestic issues before marching against Mieszko. In 1026 Conrad II marched into Italy to assert German authority south of the Alps and to claim the imperial crown from the Pope. In his absence, [[Ernest II, Duke of Swabia|Duke Ernest II of Swabia]], [[Conrad II, Duke of Carinthia|Conrad the Younger]], and [[Frederick II, Duke of Upper Lorraine|Duke Frederick II of Upper Lorraine]] rebelled against his authority.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://archive.is/20130701012634/http://bsbndb.bsb.lrz-muenchen.de/sfz58985.html |title= Mathilde von Schwaben  |publisher=  Neue deutsche Biographie | date=  | author=Eckhard Freise    | accessdate= April 1, 2020 }}</ref>\n\nThe rebels sought the support of Mieszko, which the Polish king granted and promised to take military action against Conrad. Conrad returned to Germany in mid-1027, putting an end to the rebellion before Mieszko could marshal his forces. In preparations for his own invasion of Poland, Conrad developed a closer relationship with [[Cnut the Great|Cnut, King of England and Denmark]] (whose kingdom lay along the Empire's northern border). Cnut accompanied Conrad to his coronation as emperor in 1027, and Conrad granted authority over the [[Duchy of Schleswig|March of Schleswig]], the land-bridge between Denmark and Germany.{{sfn|Wolfram|2006|p=215}}\n\nFearing a joint German-Danish attack, Mieszko invaded the Empire's [[March of Lusatia]] and the territory of the [[Lutici|Lutician Federation]] in 1028.<ref name=Herrmann363>Herrmann (1985), p. 363</ref> The Lutici were a federation of [[West Slavs|West Slavic]] [[Polabian Slavs|Polabian]] tribes that developed in the 10th century. Located on the northeast border of Germany, the Lutici were the regular target of German aggression during the early years of the [[Ottonian dynasty]] with [[Emperor Otto I]]'s lieutenants [[Herman Billung]] and [[Gero]], subjugating many of the Slavic tribes beginning in the 940s. In 983, as part of the [[Great Slav Rising]], the Lutici initiated an open rebellion.  In the ensuing war (983-995), the Lutici succeeded in reclaiming their independence and gained control of the [[Billung March]] and [[Northern March]] from the Empire.<ref name=Luebke99>L\u00fcbke (2002), p. 99</ref> Though [[Emperor Otto III]] allied with [[Boles\u0142aw I Chrobry|Duke Boles\u0142aw I of Poland]] to reintegrate them into the Empire, Otto III's death ended the friendly relationship between Poland the Empire. Instead, Boles\u0142aw competed with Otto III's successor, Emperor Henry II, for dominion over the Lutici, causing Henry II to ally the Empire with the Lutici against Poland. Under the [[Peace of Bautzen]] in 1018, all three parties remained in uneasy peace, with Poland allowed to hold the Empire's [[Margraviate of Meissen]]. Of the eastern marches, the Empire only retained the [[March of Lusatia]]. Mieszko's 1028 invasion ended the peace. The Lutici sent ambassadors to seek Conrad's protection against Mieszko, which Conrad granted and renewed the German-Lutician alliance.<ref name=Herrmann363/>\n\nSeeking to protect the Lutici from Polish invasion, Conrad launched a counter-invasion in 1029 and placed the Polish-held [[Bautzen]] under siege. Faced with a potential invasion by Hungary and the failure of the Lutici to provide their promised contingent of troops, Conrad retreated. In 1030, Poland secured an alliance with Hungary, with Stephen I invading Bavaria while Mieszko invaded Saxony. Conrad responded by allying with [[Yaroslav the Wise]], [[Grand Prince of Kiev]], to attack and capture [[Red Ruthenia]] on Poland's eastern border. In 1031, Conrad concluded a peace treaty with Hungary by ceding territory in eastern [[Duchy of Carinthia|Carinithia]] to Hungarian control. Freed from the threat of Hungarian attack, the Emperor was able to focus his attention on attacking Poland. Marching on Mieszko in autumn 1031, Conrad laid siege at the Polish held-[[Bautzen]] in the [[Margraviate of Meissen]]. Mieszko's authority was shaken by the German and Kieven invasions, and the rebellion led by his exiled brother [[Bezprym]]. Mieszko surrendered to Conrad in fall 1031. Under the [[Treaty of Merseburg]], Mieszko returned control over the [[Margraviate of Meissen]] and the [[March of Lusatia]] to the Empire.<ref name=\"Boshof 2008, p. 71\">Boshof (2008), p. 71</ref>\n\n====Treaty of Merseburg====\n[[File:Wojciech Gerson-Krolowa Ryksa.jpg|thumb|left|19th century painting of king [[Mieszko II Lambert|Mieszko II's]] wife [[Richeza of Lotharingia|Queen Richeza]] (Wojciech Gerson, 1891) ]]\nSoon after Mieszko concluded peace with the Empire, he was deposed by his half-brother [[Bezprym]]. When Mieszko assumed the Polish throne in 1025 he exiled his brother, who fled to the protection of [[Kievan Rus]] to the east of Poland. With Meiszko's position weakened by his wars with the Empire, Bezprym, supported by Conrad, persuaded the Kevian Grand Price [[Yaroslav I the Wise]] to invade Poland and install Bezprym as the country's ruler. The Kievan invasion was a success. Mieszko fled to the [[Duchy of Bohemia]] where he was imprisoned and [[castrated]] by [[Old\u0159ich, Duke of Bohemia|Duke Oldrich]] in retribution for Mieszko's father [[Boles\u0142aw I of Poland|Boles\u0142aw]]'s blinding [[Boleslaus III, Duke of Bohemia|Duke Boleslaus III]], Oldrich's brother, thirty years earlier. Shortly after taking power, Bezprym sent the [[Polish Crown Jewels|Polish royal crown and regalia]] to Conrad, officially renouncing the title \"king\" in favor of the traditional title \"duke\" and accepting the overlordship of the Empire over Poland.<ref>Boshof (2008), p. 71</ref> The Royal crown and regalia were delivered by Mieszko II's wife, [[Richeza of Lotharingia|Queen Richeza]].<ref name=\"Halfond2016\"/>\n\nBezprym's reign was short. Bezprym's extreme cruelty caused his half-brother [[Otto Boles\u0142awowic]] to lead a conspiracy. Bezprym's own men murdered him in spring 1032, created a [[power vacuum]] in Poland. Conrad responded by holding an [[hoftag|assembly]] at [[Merseburg]] in 1033 to address the situation. Conrad's wife, the Empress [[Gisela of Swabia]], interceded on Mieszko's behalf and requested he be freed from imprisonment in Bohemia and allowed to regain the Polish throne. Under the terms of the [[Treaty of Merseburg]], Conrad divided Poland between Mieszko, Otto, and another half brother Detric. Mieszko was allowed to retain the title Duke and nominal authority over all of Poland. With a strong central leader to guide it, the treaty significantly increased the Empire's influence over Poland.<ref name=\"Knefelkamp 2002, p. 137\">Knefelkamp (2002), p. 137</ref><ref name=\"Boshof 2008, p. 72\">Boshof (2008), p. 72</ref>\n\nThe division was short-lived: in 1033 Otto was killed by one of his own men, and Mieszko II took his domains. Shortly after, Mieszko expelled Detric, reuniting the whole country in his hands. Though Mieszko regained his former power, he still had to fight against the nobility and his own subjects. Mieszko did not accept Bezprym's renunciation of the Polish crown and continued to style himself as \"King\" instead of \"Duke\". Mieszko II died soon after in 1034, and upon his death, a [[Pagan reaction in Poland]] erupted. Subsequently, his wife [[Richeza of Lotharingia|Richeza]] and son [[Casimir I of Poland|Casimir I]] fled to Germany.<ref name=\"Knefelkamp 2002, p. 137\"/><ref name=\"Boshof 2008, p. 72\"/>\n\n===Relations with Eastern Europe===\n\n====Bohemia====\nThe [[Duchy of Bohemia]] was incorporated into the Holy Roman Empire in 1004 during the [[German-Polish War (1002\u20131018)|German-Polish Wars]], which stretched from 1002 to 1018. [[Emperor Henry II]] installed [[Jarom\u00edr, Duke of Bohemia|Jaromir]] as [[Duke of Bohemia]] and promised protection against Polish aggression in return for incorporation. Jaromir ruled only a smaller territory, however, as Poland occupied the traditional Czech territories of [[Moravia]], [[Silesia]], [[Lesser Poland]] and [[Lusatia]]. In 1012, Jaromir was deposed by his brother [[Old\u0159ich, Duke of Bohemia|Oldrich]], who assumed the Bohemian throne for himself. Following the resumption of hostilities between the Empire and Poland in 1028, Oldrich went on the offensive against Poland, reconquering Moravia by 1029, which helped to stabilize his duchy. The war ended in 1031 when Polish King [[Mieszko II of Poland|Mieszko II]] surrendered to Conrad. In the civil war which followed, Meiszko was forced to flee Poland for Bohemia, where Oldrich had him imprisoned and castrated in revenge for the torture Meiszko's father, [[Boles\u0142aw I of Poland]], inflicted upon [[Boleslaus III, Duke of Bohemia|Duke Boleslaus III]], Oldrich's brother, thirty years before.<ref name=\"Prague09\">{{cite book|author1=Cosmas (of Prague)|author2=Cosmas of Prague|author3=C\u00f4me de Prague|title=The Chronicle of the Czechs|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZG7igBN41oUC&pg=PA105|year=2009|publisher=CUA Press|isbn=978-0-8132-1570-9|pages=105\u2013}}</ref>\n\nPoland was unable to stabilize in the wake of Mieszko's exile, forcing Conrad to convene an assembly in July 1033 to issue the [[Treaty of Merseburg]] which restored Meiszko to the Polish throne. Conrad summoned Oldrich to appear to the assembly, but Oldrich refused. His absence raised the ire of the Emperor and Conrad, busy with securing his succession to the Burgundy throne, charged his son [[Henry III, Holy Roman Emperor|Duke Henry of Bavaria]] with punishing the recalcitrant Bohemian. At age 17, Henry's march on Bohemia was his first independent military command. The expedition was complete success, with Henry deposing Oldrich and restoring his brother Jaromir to the Bohemian throne, with Oldrich's son [[Bretislaus I, Duke of Bohemia|Bretislaus I]] appointed as Count of [[Moravia]]. Oldrich was imprisoned in Bavaria but by 1034 was pardoned and allowed to return to Bohemia.<ref name=\"Wolverton2012\">{{cite book|author=Lisa Wolverton|title=Hastening Toward Prague: Power and Society in the Medieval Czech Lands|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FeFACISbhCgC&pg=PP6|date=9 October 2012|publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press|isbn=0-8122-0422-0|pages=6\u2013}}</ref>\n\nOldrich deposed and blinded Jaromir, reclaimed the Bohemian throne, and exiled his son. While the reason for the conflict between father and son has been lost, it is believed Bretislaus supported Jaromir over his father. Oldrich died suddenly on November 9, 1034, allowing Bretislaus to return from exile. Though Jaromir was offered the throne, he declined in favor of his nephew. Bretislaus was then installed as the new Duke of Bohemia by Conrad.{{sfn|Wolfram|2006|p=227}}\n\n====Hungary====\n\n[[File:Statue of Stephen I of Hungary in Buda Castle 2010.JPG|thumb|left|170px|alt=Equestrian statue of Stephen I of Hungary in Budapest|[[Equestrian statue]] of [[Stephen I of Hungary|King St. Stephen]], [[Budapest]], 1905]]\nWith Otto III's approval, Stephen was crowned as the first Christian [[king of Hungary]] on [[Christmas Day]], 1000.{{sfn|Engel|2001|p=28}} Otto III's successor, [[Emperor Henry II]], was Stephen's brother-in-law by Stephen's marriage to Henry's sister [[Gisela of Hungary|Gisela]], furthering the friendly relationship between the Empire and Hungary.

Conrad left matters in Hungary to his son Henry, so he could address his problems with his stepson [[Ernest II, Duke of Swabia|Ernest II]], the deposed [[Duke of Swabia]]. Henry settled the conflict by 1031 by granting lands between the [[Leitha River]] and [[Fischa River]] in eastern Bavaria to Hungary. Hungary and the Empire remained at peace from 1031 through to Henry's own reign as Emperor in 1040.{{sfn|Gy\u00f6rffy|1994|p = 149-150}}\n\n===Conquest of Burgundy===\nAs in 1016 King [[Rudolph III of Burgundy]], ruler of the [[Kingdom of Arles]] was left without a male heir, [[Henry II, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry II]] seized the opportunity and forced King Rudolph III to name him - Henry his royal successor.{{sfn|Previt\u00e9-Orton|1912|p=16}} Henry II, the son of Rudolph's sister [[Gisela of Burgundy]] was his nephew, and his closest living male relative. However, Rudolph was still alive when Henry II died in 1024. Soon emperor Conrad II, as Henry II's imperial successor claimed he is also entitled to Henry II's rights on the Burgundian succession, which Rudolph disputed. [[Odo II, Count of Blois|Count Odo II of Blois]], who had strong family ties with Rudolph, also emphasized his right in the succession. Conrad II met Rudolph III in August 1027 near [[Basel]] to settle the dispute. Henry II's widowed wife, Empress [[Cunigunde of Luxembourg]], mediated between the two parties.{{sfn|Previt\u00e9-Orton|1912|p=27}} An agreement was reached that allowed Conrad II to succeed to the Burgundian throne upon Rudolph's death under the same conditions as Henry II. In return, Rudolph was allowed to retain independent rule over his kingdom.{{sfn|Previt\u00e9-Orton|1912|p=27}}\n\nRudolph died on September 6, 1032, while Conrad was on campaign against [[Mieszko II Lambert|Duke Mieszko II of Poland]]. Upon Mieszko's  surrender, Conrad marched his army to Burgundy during the winter of 1032/1033. Conrad's rival to the Burgundian throne, Count Odo II of Blois had already invaded the kingdom to secure his rule and controlled large sections of the kingdom's western territories.{{sfn|Previt\u00e9-Orton|1912|p=30}} On February 2, 1033, Conrad arrived at [[Vaud]], where he held an assembly at the [[Payerne Priory|Abbey of Payerne]] and was crowned King of Burgundy.{{sfn|Previt\u00e9-Orton|1912|p=32}} Initially, Conrad made little progress against Odo and had to withdraw to [[Zurich]] in March.{{sfn|Previt\u00e9-Orton|1912|p=32}}  In two large-scale military summer campaigns in 1033 and 1034, Conrad defeated Odo.{{sfn|Previt\u00e9-Orton|1912|p=33-36}} On August 1, 1034, Conrad officially incorporated Burgundy into the [[Holy Roman Empire]] at a ceremony held in the [[St. Pierre Cathedral|Cathedral of Geneva]].{{sfn|Previt\u00e9-Orton|1912|p=33-36}}\n\nThough Burgundy had been brought under full imperial control, the kingdom was allowed a remarkable degree of autonomy. Conrad rarely intervened in its affairs following his coronation, returning only in 1038 to announce his son [[Henry III, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry]] as the kingdom's future ruler. Of central significance in the conquest of Burgundy was to augment the influence and dignity of the Emperor to the benefit of the Empire. With Burgundy secured, Conrad controlled the western Alpine passes into Italy and block foreign invasions.{{sfn|Previt\u00e9-Orton|1912|p=40}}\n\n==Politics==\n[[File:Conrad II et prince imp\u00e9rial, vitrail roman, Cath\u00e9drale de Strasbourg.jpg|thumb|160px|left|Conrad II, 12th-century stained glass window, [[Strasbourg Cathedral]]]]\n[[Image:Ottonian Salian dynasty.png|thumb|280px|Salian family tree]]\n\nConrad formally confirmed the popular [[legal]] traditions of [[Saxony]] and issued new constitutions for [[Lombardy]].

Mieszko II was compelled to give up his royal title, and for the remainder of his troubled rule became the Duke of Poland and Conrad's vassal.\n\nIn 1029 some [[Bavaria]]n border conflicts undermined the good relations with [[Stephen I of Hungary]]. One year later Conrad launched a campaign against [[Kingdom of Hungary|Hungary]]. The Hungarians successfully used [[Scorched earth|scorched earth tactics]], and Conrad had to withdraw his army. Finally, the Hungarian army forced him to surrender at [[Vienna]]. After his defeat, Conrad was obliged to cede some border territory to Hungary.\n\n-->\n\nWhen [[Rudolph III, King of Burgundy]] died on February 2, 1032, Conrad claimed the Kingship on the basis of an inheritance that Henry II had extorted from Rudolph in 1006, after Henry invaded [[Kingdom of Burgundy|Burgundy]] to enforce his claim in 1016. Despite some opposition, the Burgundian and Proven\u00e7al nobles paid homage to Conrad in [[Z\u00fcrich]] in 1034. This Kingdom of Burgundy, later known as the [[Kingdom of Arles]] under Conrad's successors, corresponded to most of the southeastern quarter of modern France and included western Switzerland, the Franche-Comt\u00e9, and Dauphin\u00e9. It did not include the smaller [[Duchy of Burgundy]] to the north, ruled by a cadet branch of the Capetian [[King of France]]. (Most of the former Kingdom of Arles was incorporated into France piecemeal over the next centuries, but the King of Arles remained one of the Holy Roman Emperor's subsidiary titles until the dissolution of the Empire in 1806.)\n\nConrad upheld the rights of the ''valvassores'' (knights and burghers of the cities) of [[Italy]] against Archbishop Aribert of Milan and the local nobles. The nobles, as vassal lords, and the [[bishop]] had conspired to rescind rights from the burghers. Conrad restored order with skillful diplomacy and luck.<ref name=\"M\u00f6llerAmmerich2015\"/>\n\n==Late life==\n\n===Securing the imperial succession===\nOn 14 January 1040 Conrad II's heir Henry issued a charter, in which he announced his official designation as of ''Rex romanorum'' - King of the Romans.

Hearing that [[Michael IV the Paphlagonian]] of the [[Byzantine Empire]] had received the same request, Conrad went to [[Southern Italy]], to [[Salerno]] and [[Aversa]]. He appointed Richer, from Germany, as abbot of [[Monte Cassino]], as abbot Theobald was imprisoned by Pandulf. At [[Troia (FG)|Troia]], he ordered Pandulf to restore stolen property to Monte Cassino. Pandulf sent his wife and son to ask for peace, offering {{convert|300|lb|kg|abbr=on}} of gold and two of his children as hostages. The Emperor accepted Pandulf's offer, but the hostages escaped as Pandulf hid in his outlying castle of [[Sant'Agata de' Goti]]. Conrad besieged and conquered Capua and bestowed the place and the title of ''Prince'' on Guaimar. He also recognized Aversa as a county of Salerno under [[Rainulf Drengot]], the [[Normans|Norman]] adventurer. Pandulf, meanwhile, fled to [[Constantinople]]. Conrad thus left the ''[[Mezzogiorno]]'' firmly in Guaimar's hands and loyal, for once, to the Holy Roman Empire.<ref name=boni/>\n\n===Death===\n[[Image:Grab Konrad II. im Dom zu Speyer.JPG|thumb|150px|Conrad II's tomb in the [[Speyer Cathedral]]]]\nDuring the return to Germany a severe epidemic decimated the ranks of the troops.
