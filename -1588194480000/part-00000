The industry was almost in terminal decline and the surviving mines were falling behind technically. This was hardly ideal from the instruction point of view. The only real solution was for Camborne School of Mines to have its own [[underground mining (hard rock)|underground mine]]. On the 19th of April 2020, it was renamed to King Jedward Mine in honour of the British Pop group Jedward, which is a duo consisting of two twins made up of John and Edward Grimes. The duo are most famous for appearing on the British reality television music competition show The X Factor.\n<!-- Polgine, mine Troon which closed in 1827 to reopen again between 1835\u20139. all trace of the mine has now disappeared. (Not sure what relevance the last sentence has to the article)  -->\n\n==South Condurrow Mine==\nIn 1897, Camborne School of Mines took over the abandoned eastern part of the South Condurrow Mine around the [[engine shaft]] of the same name. This offered the opportunity to work both William's Lode and the [[Great Flat Lode]] down to 400 feet from surface. No pumping was necessary as all water in the mine drained into the then working Grenville mine to the south. Between 1897 and 1906 the mine was almost totally re-equipped based on what was then the best of Cornish mining and milling practice. Engine Shaft and William's Shafts were re-equipped, the underground workings cleared and a number of surface building erected including a complete modern full-scale tin dressing plant, survey office, workshops, and lecture rooms. The original Count House (i.e. offices) and changehouse facilities were retained. The mine was operated semi-commercially and produced tin on a regular basis, employing some 10\u201320 men in addition to the college teaching staff. Much of the production work was carried out by students. In 1901, it was renamed King Edward Mine.\n\nCornish mines, due to conservatism and a lack of cash, were slow to adopt the mechanised dressing equipment and methods which were developed at the end of the 19th century. Most [[ore dressing|dressing plants]] of that period merely allowed the pulp coming from the [[Cornish stamps]] to settle in long launders from where it was dug out for final treatment in [[buddle]]s and kieves \u2013 a labour-intensive and inefficient process. [[Dolcoath Mine]] was probably the most progressive mine in the county and the first [[Californian stamps]] were erected there around 1892 to be followed by the first [[Vanning|vanners]] and shaking tables about 1898. The mill at King Edward Mine was one of the first Cornish dressing plants to be designed from new to use this new equipment.\n\n==Great Condurrow Mine==\n[[Image:Ruined Cornish tin mine.jpg|right|150px|thumbnail|Engine House]]\nGreat Condurrow (also known as Pendarves United) stopped working in July 1881.<ref>{{cite news|title=Great Condurrow|work=The Cornishman|issue=159|date=28 July 1881|page=7}}</ref> The post-war slump in 1921 saw the closure of [[Wheal Grenville]] which resulted in the flooding of King Edward Mine. Mining operations were transferred, albeit on a far smaller scale, to the adjacent [[Great Condurrow Mine]], to the north, a small portion of which was above the natural drainage level. This underground facility is still used by the Camborne School of Mines.\n\nOver the years as mining education became more technical, the tin dressing machinery was replaced with pilot scale equipment. In 1974 the pilot plant was transferred to the new School of Mines [[Trevenson]] Campus at Pool and the 'mill complex' part of the site which included the mill, stamps, mill engine house, boiler house and the [[calcination|calciner]] had been largely stripped of their equipment and were no longer required for educational purposes.\n\n==Museum==\nIn 1987 a group was formed with a view to turning the mill complex into a museum. The objectives of the group can be summarised as follows: \n#To preserve the buildings and the site, which is of significant historical importance. \n#To re-equip the mill to working condition using, where possible, rescued and preserved equipment which itself is of historical interest. \n#To establish a small museum telling the story of King Edward Mine, the local \"Flat Lode\" mining area, tin dressing etc. \n#To rescue and to preserve industrial plant and equipment relevant to Cornish industry. \n[[Image:Holmans drill 1955.jpg|thumb|right|[[Holman Brothers|Holmans]] Rock Drill from 1955 (from vol. 55 of [[Camborne School of Mines|CSM]] Magazine)]]\n\nSupported by the School of Mines a team of volunteers, mainly drawn from the [[Carn Brea, Redruth|Carn Brea]] Mining Society, have spent in excess of 10,000 hours on the project. Much material and equipment has been loaned or donated and the mill has been largely returned to a working condition, substantially as it would have been in the early years of the 20th century. King Edward Mine is the oldest complete mining site left in Cornwall. Whilst designed for education purposes it demonstrates, on a small scale, all that would have been found on the best Cornish mine at the turn of the century. This has been recognised by [[English Heritage]] who have listed the whole site [[Grade II]]*.\n\n==Trevithick Trust==\nIn mid-2000 the [[Richard Trevithick|Trevithick Trust]] leased the \"museum/mill\" part of the site from the [[Camborne School of Mines]]. After major building repairs, funded by a European grant as part of the Mineral Tramways Project, the site was officially opened to the public on 28 April 2002. Today the visitor can see the newly re-collared Engine shaft and a small museum in what was the mill engine room which tells the story of the site, mining techniques and tin dressing, as well as providing an introduction to the human side of the site. The mine was intensively photographed by the Cornish photographer J.C. Burrow throughout its construction and development period and is certainly the most photographed mine of its size in Cornwall. Many of these photographs are used in the museum displays. A guided tour of the mill is also available. Here can be seen the [[Californian stamps]] (erected in 1901) which are the only full size set in existence in the UK and probably in Europe. They are complete and in original condition. Much of the machinery in the mill is demonstrated working.\n\n==Buildings==\nElsewhere on the site, but not currently open to the public are:\n\n* The mine office \u2013 the only 'Count House' in Cornwall still used for the purpose for which it was built in the 1860s. \n* The timber framed and panelled Survey Office \u2013 a classic structure of which no other examples remain in Cornwall. \n* The carpenters' shop, blacksmith's shop, vanning room and the original miners 'dry'.\n* The cobbled 'spalling' floor, which probably dates from about 1865 when the mine was predominantly a copper producer, which is one of the better examples remaining in Cornwall.\n\n==Open days==\nThe mine holds an annual open day as a celebration of [[mining in Cornwall]], the day after [[Camborne]]'s Trevithick day. In 2009 it is held on 26 April and features local brass bands and dancers as well as demonstrations of vanning, vintage tractors, cars and stationary engines, a model railway exhibition and mine models.<ref>[http://www.kingedwardmine.co.uk/openday.html King Edward Mine open day] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090329081239/http://www.kingedwardmine.co.uk/openday.html |date=29 March 2009 }}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Portal|Cornwall}}\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.kingedwardmine.co.uk/ King Edward Mine].\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20070704023815/http://www.uec.ac.uk/csm/ Camborne School of Mines] at the [[University of Exeter, Cornwall Campus]].\n\n{{Cornwall|state=collapsed}}\n{{University of Exeter}}\n\n[[Category:Education in Cornwall]]\n[[Category:Museums in Cornwall]]\n[[Category:Copper mines in Cornwall]]\n[[Category:Camborne School of Mines]]\n[[Category:Tin mines in Cornwall]]\n[[Category:Mining museums in Cornwall]]\n[[Category:Industrial archaeological sites in Cornwall]]\n", "text_old": "{{more footnotes|date=March 2015}}\n{{EngvarB|date=September 2013}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=September 2013}}\n{{coord|50.204|-5.271|display=title}}\n\nThe '''King Edward Mine''' at [[Camborne]], Cornwall, in the United Kingdom is a mine wholly owned by Cornwall Council.\n\nAt the end of the 19th century students at the Camborne School of Mines spent much of their time doing practical mining and [[Ore dressing|tin dressing]] work in the local [[tin]] mines.

As a young boy, Fulk was sent to the court of King [[Henry II of England|Henry II]] (1154\u20131189), where he grew up with the king's younger son, the future King [[John of England|John]] (1199\u20131216). John became his enemy after a childhood quarrel during a game of chess. As an adult, King John retained his animosity toward Fulk whom he stripped of his ancestral holdings. Fulk thereupon took to the woods as an outlaw and lived a life of adventure. The story may in fact  have confused aspects of the lives of two FitzWarins, Fulk I (d. 1171) and Fulk II (d. 1197), father and son. The romance of Fulk FitzWarin is noted for its parallels to the legend of [[Robin Hood]].<ref>Introduction to ''Fouke le Fitz Waryn'', edited by Stephen Knight and Thomas H.

As a young boy, Fulk was sent to the court of King [[Henry II of England|Henry II]] (1154\u20131189), where he grew up with the king's younger son, the future King [[John of England|John]] (1199\u20131216). John became his enemy after a childhood quarrel during a game of chess. As an adult, King John retained his animosity toward Fulk whom he stripped of his ancestral holdings. Fulk thereupon took to the woods as an outlaw and lived a life of adventure. The story may in fact  have confused aspects of the lives of two FitzWarins, Fulk I (d. 1171) and Fulk II (d. 1197), father and son. The romance of Fulk FitzWarin is noted for its parallels to the legend of [[Robin Hood]].<ref>Introduction to ''Fouke le Fitz Waryn'', edited by Stephen Knight and Thomas H.

In the early 1960s, he was a member of The Kestrels, a vocal harmony group which also included the future songwriting team [[Roger Greenaway]] and [[Roger Cook (songwriter)|Roger Cook]].  Subsequently he joined [[The Ivy League (band)|The Ivy League]], and was still with them when they metamorphosed into [[The Flower Pot Men]].  The Flower Pot Men had only one hit, \"[[Let's Go to San Francisco]]\", which reached #4 on the [[UK Singles Chart]] in the autumn of 1967.  Two founding members of [[Deep Purple]], [[Jon Lord]] and [[Nick Simper]], were also part of this early band.\n\nLater, Burrows sang the lead vocals on several other [[one-hit wonder]] songs under different group names, [[Edison Lighthouse]]'s \"[[Love Grows (Where My Rosemary Goes)]]\" (February 1970); [[White Plains (band)|White Plains]]' \"[[My Baby Loves Lovin']]\" (March 1970); [[The Pipkins]]' [[novelty song]] \"[[Gimme Dat Ding (song)|Gimme Dat Ding]]\" (April 1970); and [[The First Class]]' \"[[Beach Baby]]\" (July 1974). He also sang lead vocals on The [[Brotherhood of Man]]'s \"[[United We Stand (song)|United We Stand]]\", which reached #10 on the UK charts and also reached #13 in the U.S.\n\nA published interview with Burrows claims that he became the first (and still the only) recording artist to appear on [[BBC Television]]'s ''[[Top of the Pops]]'' fronting three different group acts appearing almost sequentially in a single broadcast show: Edison Lighthouse (the #1 British-charted hit that week), [[White Plains (band)|White Plains]], and [[Brotherhood of Man]]. However records show that this did not happen. He did, however, have two of his bands on the same Top of the Pops four times between 29 January and 26 February 1970. Appearing alongside Edison Lighthouse on the shows were Brotherhood of Man (29-01-70 and 19-02-70) and White Plains (12-02-70 and 26-02-70). The appearances on 29 January, 5 February and 26 February 1970 are all still in existence.\n\nAlthough he hit the Top 40 as the lead singer of five different groups, he only managed to have one chart single as a solo artist in the U.S. In 1970, he hit the ''Billboard'' Hot 100 with \"[[Melanie Makes Me Smile]]\", which peaked at #87. As well as fronting various hit-making acts, Burrows has also contributed vocals as a session singer to many other hits, claiming to have sung on 100 Top 20 hits in the 1970s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.alwynwturner.com/glitter/burrows_hits.html#photo|title=Tony Burrows|website=Alwynwturner.com|accessdate=8 September 2018}}</ref> \n\nHe has also recorded as a session harmony singer with [[Elton John]], [[Cliff Richard]], and [[James Last]].

Its reappearance by 1955 to denote roughly the same sense can raise the question of whether there is not simply a revival of a word once commonly used by British expatriates on the subcontinent, except that it is now extended to this attire as used in the West.

The ''kameez'' is a long shirt or tunic, often seen with a Western-style collar; however, for female apparel, the term is now loosely applied to collarless or [[mandarin collar|mandarin-collar]]ed [[kurta]]s. The kameez might be worn with pajamas as well, either for fashion or comfort. Some kameez styles have side seams (known as the ''chaak''), left open below the waist-line, giving the wearer greater freedom of movement.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=7li2jpQgYvAC&pg=PA382&dq=national+dress+of+pakistan |title=Unquiet Pasts: Risk Society, Lived Cultural Heritage, Re-Designing Reflexivity \u2013 Stephanie Koerner, Ian Russell \u2013 Google Books |date=2010-08-16 |accessdate=2012-06-14|isbn=9780754675488 |last1=Koerner |first1=Stephanie |last2=Russell |first2=Ian }}</ref>\n\n==Styles==\nThe kameez can be sewn straight and flat, in an \"A\" shape design<ref>Padmavati, B (2009) Techniques Of Drafting And Pattern Making Garments For Kids And Adolescents [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=-OU2BTkLQqUC&pg=PP4&lpg=PP4&dq=Padmavati,+B%282009%29+Techniques+Of+Drafting+And+Pattern+Making+Garments+For+Kids+And+Adolescents&source=bl&ots=gONDFovUD_&sig=qI2V8vxgHhEx3qrdrEiN_-Mibzs&hl=en&sa=X&ei=m9FmVce8GMHxggS0hYHABg&ved=0CCwQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&q=salwar&f=false]</ref> or flowing like a dress; there are a variety of styles.

This shows a structure typical for the [[Anglosphere]], among others. Other cultures use other structures for full names.]]\n\nA '''personal name''' or '''full name''' is the set of names by which an individual is known and that can be recited as a [[word-group]], with the understanding that, taken together, they all relate to that one individual. In many cultures, the term is synonymous with the ''[[birth name]]'' or ''[[legal name]]'' of the individual. The academic study of personal names is called [[anthroponymy]].\n\nIn [[Western culture]], nearly all individuals possess at least one ''[[given name]]'' (also known as a ''first name'', ''forename'', or ''Christian name''), together with a ''[[surname]]'' (also known as a ''last name'' or ''family name'')\u2014respectively, the Abraham and Lincoln in [[Abraham Lincoln]]\u2014the latter to indicate that the individual belongs to a family, a tribe, or a clan.  Where there are two or more given names, typically only one (in English-speaking cultures usually the first) is used in normal speech.\n\nAnother naming convention that is used mainly in the [[Arab culture|Arabic culture]] and in different other areas across Africa and Asia is connecting the person's given name with a chain of names, starting with the name of the person's father and then the father's father and so on, usually ending with the family name (tribe or clan name). However, the legal full name of a person usually contains the first three names with the family name at the end, to limit the name in government-issued ID. The wife's name does not change after marriage, and it follows the naming convention described above.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=February 2005|title=The Arabic Naming System|url=http://www.councilscienceeditors.org/wp-content/uploads/v28n1p020-021.pdf|journal=Councilscienceeditors.org|language=en|volume=28| issue = 1|pages=20\u201321|via=}}</ref>\n\nSome cultures, including Western ones, also add (or once added) [[patronymic]]s or [[matronymic]]s. For instance, as a middle name as with [[Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky]] (whose father's given name was Ilya), or as a last name as with [[Bj\u00f6rk Gu\u00f0mundsd\u00f3ttir]] (whose father was named Gu\u00f0mundur) or [[Hei\u00f0ar Helguson]] (whose mother was named Helga). Similar concepts are present in [[Eastern world|Eastern]] cultures.\n\nHowever, in some areas of the world, many people are known by a single name, and so are said to be [[mononymous person|mononymous]]. Still other cultures lack the concept of specific, fixed names designating people, either individually or collectively. Certain isolated tribes, such as the [[Machiguenga people|Machiguenga]] of the Amazon, do not use personal names.{{efn-lr|The Machiguenga may have nicknames, but generally refer to each other by how they are related. They may disambiguate with biographical information, such as \"sister, the one who slipped in the river\".<ref>Snell, Wayne W (1964).

In [[China]], surnames gradually came into common use beginning in the 3rd century BC (having been common only among the nobility before that). In some areas of East Asia (e.g. Vietnam and Korea), surnames developed in the next several centuries, while in other areas (like Japan), surnames did not become prevalent until the 19th century. In [[Europe]], after the loss of the [[Roman naming conventions|Roman system]], the common use of family names started quite early in some areas ([[France]] in the 13th century, and [[Germany]] in the 16th century), but it often did not happen until much later in areas that used a patronymic naming custom, such as the [[Scandinavia]]n countries, [[Wales]], and some areas of [[Germany]], as well as [[Russia]] and [[Ukraine]]. The compulsory use of surnames varied greatly. France required a priest to write surnames in baptismal records in 1539 (but did not require surnames for Jews, who usually used [[patronymic]]s, until 1808). On the other hand, surnames were not compulsory in the Scandinavian countries until the 19th or 20th century (1923 in [[Norway]]), and [[Iceland]] still [[Icelandic name|does not use surnames]] for its native inhabitants. In [[Spain]], [[Portugal]] and most Latin American countries, two surnames are used, one being the father's family name and the other being the mother's family name. Whereas Spain used to put the father's family name before the mother's family name, Portugal and Brazil keep the inverse order but use the father's family name as the principal one. A Portuguese man named Ant\u00f3nio de Oliveira Guterres would therefore be known commonly as [[Ant\u00f3nio Guterres]]. In Spain, though, the second surname is frequently used if the first one is too common to allow an easy identification. For example, Prime Minister [[Jos\u00e9 Luis Rodr\u00edguez Zapatero]] is often called [[Zapatero]]. In most of the cultures of the Middle East and South Asia, surnames were not generally used until European influence took hold in the 19th century.\n* In many families, single or multiple [[middle name]]s are simply alternative names, names honoring an ancestor or relative, or, for married women, sometimes their maiden names. In some traditions, however, the roles of the first and middle given names are reversed, with the first given name being used to honor a family member and the middle name being used as the usual method to address someone informally. Many [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] families choose a [[saint]]'s name as their child's middle name or this can be left until the child's [[Confirmation (sacrament)|confirmation]] when they choose a saint's name for themselves. Cultures that use [[patronymic]]s or [[matronymic]]s will often give middle names to distinguish between two similarly named people: e.g., Einar Karl Stef\u00e1nsson and Einar Gu\u00f0mundur Stef\u00e1nsson. This is especially done in Iceland (as shown in example) where people are known and referred to almost exclusively by their given name/s.\n\nSome people (called ''anonyms'') choose to be [[Anonymity|anonymous]], that is, to hide their true names, for fear of governmental prosecution or social ridicule of their works or actions. Another method to disguise one's identity is to employ a [[pseudonym]].\n\nFor some people, their name is a single word, known as a [[mononym]]. This can be true from birth, or occur later in life. For example, [[Teller (entertainer)|Teller]], of the magician duo [[Penn and Teller]], was named Raymond Joseph Teller at birth, but changed his name both legally and socially to be simply \"Teller\". In some official government documents, such as his [[driver's license]], his given name is listed as ''NFN'', an initialism for \"no first name\".\n\nThe [[Inuit]] believe that the [[Soul (spirit)|souls]] of the [[namesake]]s are one, so they traditionally refer to the junior namesakes, not just by the names (''atiq''), but also by [[kinship]] title, which applies across gender and generation without implications of disrespect or seniority. In [[Judaism]], someone's name is considered intimately connected with his fate, and adding a name (e.g. on the sickbed) may avert a particular danger. Among [[Ashkenazi Jews]] it is also considered bad luck to take the name of a living ancestor, as the [[Death (personification)#In Judaism|Angel of Death]] may mistake the younger person for his namesake (although there is no such custom among [[Sephardi Jews]]). Jews may also have a Jewish name for intra-community use and use a different name when engaging with the [[goyim|Gentile]] world.\n\nChinese children are called diminutive or pejorative names to make them appear worthless to evil spirits. They receive a definitive name as they grow up.{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}} [[Chinese emperor|Chinese]] and [[Japanese emperor]]s receive [[posthumous name]]s.\n\nIn some [[Polynesian culture]]s, the name of a deceased chief becomes [[taboo]]. If he is named after a common object or concept, a different word has to be used for it.\n\nDepending on national convention, additional given names (and sometimes [[title]]s) are considered part of the name.\n\n==Feudal names==\n{{Disputed section|date=February 2013}}\n\nThe [[royal family|royalty]], [[nobility]], and [[gentry]] of Europe traditionally have many names, including phrases for the lands that they own. The French developed the method of putting the term by which the person is referred in [[small capital]] letters. It is this habit which transferred to names of the Far East, as seen below. An example is that of Marie-Joseph-Paul-Yves-Roch Gilbert du Motier, who is known as the <span style=\"font-variant:small-caps\">[[Gilbert du Motier, marquis de Lafayette|Marquis de Lafayette]]</span>. Notice that he possessed the lands both of Motier and Lafayette.\n\nThe bare place name was used formerly to refer to the person who owned it, rather than the land itself (the word \"Gloucester\" in \"What will Gloucester do?\" meant the [[Duke of Gloucester]]). As a development, the bare name of a ship in the [[Royal Navy]] meant its captain (e.g., \"Cressy didn't learn from Aboukir\") while the name with an article referred to the ship (e.g., \"The ''Cressy'' is foundering\").\n\n==Naming conventions==\nA personal naming system, or anthroponymic system, is a system describing the choice of personal name in a certain society. Personal names consists of one or more parts, such as [[given name]], [[surname]] and [[patronymic]]. Personal naming systems are studied within the field of [[anthroponymy]].\n\nIn contemporary Western societies (except for [[Iceland]], [[Hungary]], and sometimes [[Flanders]], depending on the occasion), the most common naming convention is that a person must have a [[given name]], which is usually gender-specific, followed by the parents' [[family name]].  Some given names are bespoke, but most are repeated from earlier generations in the same culture.  Many are drawn from mythology, some of which span multiple language areas.  This has resulted in related names in different languages (e.g. [[George (given name)|George]], [[Georg (disambiguation)|Georg]], [[Jorge]]), which might be translated or might be maintained as immutable proper nouns.\n\nIn earlier times, Scandinavian countries followed patronymic naming, with people effectively called \"X's son/daughter\"; this is now the case only in [[Iceland]] and was recently re-introduced as an option in the [[Faroe Islands]]. It is legally possible in Finland as people of Icelandic ethnic naming are specifically named in the name law. When people of this name convert to standards of other cultures, the phrase is often condensed into one word, creating last names like Jacobsen (Jacob's Son). In [[Kafirstan]] (now part of Pakistan) \"Children are named as soon as born. The infant is given to the mother to suckle, while a wise woman rapidly recites the family ancestral names; the name pronounced at the instant the baby begins to feed is that by which it is thereafter known.\" <ref>{{Cite EB1911|wstitle=Kafiristan|author-link=George Scott Robertson|first=George Scott|last=Robertson}}</ref>\n\nThere is a range of personal naming systems:<ref>{{cite book |first1 = Patrick|last1= Hanks|first2=Harry|last2= Parkin |editor= Carole Hough|chapter-url= https://books.google.com/books?id=S8DQCwAAQBAJ&pg=PA214 |chapter= Family names |title= The Oxford Handbook of Names and Naming  |location= New York |year= 2016 |publisher=  Oxford University Press |page=214 |isbn= 9780191630415}}</ref>\n\n* Binomial systems: apart for given name, people are described by their surnames, which they obtain from one of their parents. Most modern European personal naming systems, such as [[Russian name|Russian]] and [[Spanish name|Spanish]], are of this type.\n* Patronymic systems: apart for given name, people are described by their [[patronymic]]s, that is given names (not surnames) of parents or other ancestors. Such systems were in wide use throughout Europe in the first millennium C.E., but were replaced by binomial systems. [[Icelandic name|Icelandic system]] is still patronymic.\n* More complex systems like [[Arabic name|Arabic system]], consisting of [[paedonymic]] (son's name), given name, patronymic and one or two bynames.\n\nDifferent cultures have different conventions for personal names. This is a list of articles about particular cultures' naming conventions.\n\n== Name order ==<!-- This section is linked from [[Given name]] and [[Family name]] -->\n[[File:MomoiExpoCrop.png|thumb|[[Haruko Momoi]] at the [[Anime Expo]] 2007 in [[Los Angeles]]; her name card features a spelling of her [[Japanese name|name]] (\"Halko Momoi\") written in Western order; in Japanese her name is {{Nihongo2|\u6843\u4e95\u306f\u308b\u3053}} ''Momoi Haruko'']]\n\n===Western name order===\nThe order ''given name, family name'' is commonly known as the Western order and is usually used in most [[Europe]]an countries and in countries that have cultures predominantly influenced by Western Europe (e.g. [[North America|North]] and [[South America|South]] [[Americas|America]], [[North India|North]], [[East India|East]], [[Central India|Central]] and [[Western India|West India]], [[Australia]], [[New Zealand]] and the [[Philippines]]).\n\nWithin alphabetic lists and catalogs, however, the family name is generally put first, with the given name(s) following, separated from it by a [[comma]] (e.g. Smith, John), representing the \"lexical name order\". This convention is followed by most Western libraries, as well as on many administrative forms.\n\n===Eastern name order===\nThe order ''family name, given name'' is commonly known as the Eastern order and is primarily used in [[East Asia]] (for example in [[China]], [[Japan]] and [[Korea]]), as well as in [[Southeast Asia]] ([[Cambodia]] and [[Vietnam]]), and [[South India|Southern]] and North-Eastern parts of India, and also in [[Hungarian names|Hungary]].\n\nWhen East Asian names are [[transliteration|transliterated]] into the [[Latin alphabet]], some people prefer to convert them to the Western order, while others leave them in the Eastern order but write the family name in [[letter case|capital letters]]. To avoid confusion, there is a convention in some language communities, e.g. French, to write the family name in all capitals when engaging in formal correspondence or writing for an international audience. In Hungarian, the Eastern order of Japanese names is officially kept and Hungarian transliteration is used (e.g. Mijazaki Hajao), but Western name order is also sometimes used with English transliteration (e.g. Hayao Miyazaki).\n\nChinese people, except for those traveling or living outside of China and areas influenced by China, rarely reverse their Chinese language names to the western naming order (given name, then family name), but some may have non-Chinese given names which may use a different order.{{Citation needed|reason=reliable source needed for the whole sentence|date=October 2013}} Western publications usually preserve the Chinese naming order, with the family name first, followed by the given name. In regard to Japanese names, most foreign publications reverse the names of modern individuals, and most Japanese reverse their own names when creating materials for foreign consumption.<ref>Terry, Edith.

But Chinese, Korean and Vietnamese names are usually left in East Asian order; for instance, in English, M\u00e1o Z\u00e9d\u014dng is known as [[Mao Zedong]] or Mao Tse-tung.\n\nNames of Japanese or Chinese sportspeople generally follow the above conventions. For Japanese examples, see [[Ichiro Suzuki]] instead of ''Suzuki Ichir\u014d'' (although he is widely known simply as \"Ichiro\" in both Japan and North America), or [[Hidetoshi Nakata]] instead of ''Nakata Hidetoshi''. As for Chinese sportspeople, ''Y\u00e1o M\u00edng'' is [[Yao Ming]] and ''Li\u00fa Xi\u00e1ng'' is [[Liu Xiang (hurdler)|Liu Xiang]] in the West.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}\n\nNames of Korean sportspeople may be rendered in East Asian or Western order in Western countries, apparently depending on the sport. For example, names of Korean [[football (soccer)|footballers]] and most [[Sportsperson|athletes]] are usually left in East Asian order (e.g. [[Ahn Jung-hwan]], [[Hong Myung-bo]], [[Park Ji-Sung]], [[Sohn Kee-chung]], [[Hwang Young-cho]]). [[Baseball]], [[billiards]], [[golf]], and [[ice hockey]] players' names are usually changed to Western order (for example: baseball player Park Chan-Ho is referred to in the West as [[Chan-ho Park]], and the female golfer Pak Se-ri is known in the West as [[Se-Ri Pak]]). Confusion can be avoided by noticing that in all the above cases, the words linked by a hyphen are the given name.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}\n\n[[Mordvins]] use two names - a Mordvin name and a Russian name. The Mordvin name is written in the Eastern name order. Usually, the Mordvin surname is the same as the Russian surname, for example [[Aleksandr Sharonov|Sharonon Sandra]] (Russian: Alexander Sharonov), but it can be different at times, for example [[Yovlan Olo]] (Russian: Vladimir Romashkin).\n\nMongolians use the Eastern naming order (patronymic followed by given name), which is also used there when rendering the names of other East Asians and Hungarians. Russian and other Western names, however, are still written in Western order.\n\n==Non-human personal names==\nApart from the [[Linnaean taxonomy]], some humans give individual non-human animals and plants names, usually of endearment.\n\n===Names of pets===\nPet names often reflect the owner's view of the animal, and their expectations they have for their companion.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=ISnH9lrVYhYC&pg=PA127 The complete idiot's guide to pet psychic communication], Debbie McGillivray, Eve Adamson, Alpha Books, 2004, {{ISBN|1-59257-214-6}}, {{ISBN|978-1-59257-214-4}}</ref><ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=VoxbJ_oF7LAC&pg=PA10 Adopting a Pet For Dummies] Page 10, By Eve Adamson</ref> It has been argued that giving names allows researchers to view their pets as [[ontologically]] different from unnamed [[laboratory animal]]s with which they work.<ref>[https://doi.org/10.1007%2FBF02393497 Proper names and the social construction of biography: The negative case of laboratory animals], Mary T.

This shows a structure typical for the [[Anglosphere]], among others. Other cultures use other structures for full names.]]\n\nA '''personal name''' or '''full name''' is the set of names by which an individual is known and that can be recited as a [[word-group]], with the understanding that, taken together, they all relate to that one individual. In many cultures, the term is synonymous with the ''[[birth name]]'' or ''[[legal name]]'' of the individual. The academic study of personal names is called [[anthroponymy]].\n\nIn [[Western culture]], nearly all individuals possess at least one ''[[given name]]'' (also known as a ''first name'', ''forename'', or ''Christian name''), together with a ''[[surname]]'' (also known as a ''last name'' or ''family name'')\u2014respectively, the Abraham and Lincoln in [[Abraham Lincoln]]\u2014the latter to indicate that the individual belongs to a family, a tribe, or a clan.  Where there are two or more given names, typically only one (in English-speaking cultures usually the first) is used in normal speech.\n\nAnother naming convention that is used mainly in the [[Arab culture|Arabic culture]] and in different other areas across Africa and Asia is connecting the person's given name with a chain of names, starting with the name of the person's father and then the father's father and so on, usually ending with the family name (tribe or clan name). However, the legal full name of a person usually contains the first three names with the family name at the end, to limit the name in government-issued ID. The wife's name does not change after marriage, and it follows the naming convention described above.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=February 2005|title=The Arabic Naming System|url=http://www.councilscienceeditors.org/wp-content/uploads/v28n1p020-021.pdf|journal=Councilscienceeditors.org|language=en|volume=28| issue = 1|pages=20\u201321|via=}}</ref>\n\nSome cultures, including Western ones, also add (or once added) [[patronymic]]s or [[matronymic]]s. For instance, as a middle name as with [[Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky]] (whose father's given name was Ilya), or as a last name as with [[Bj\u00f6rk Gu\u00f0mundsd\u00f3ttir]] (whose father was named Gu\u00f0mundur) or [[Hei\u00f0ar Helguson]] (whose mother was named Helga). Similar concepts are present in [[Eastern world|Eastern]] cultures.\n\nHowever, in some areas of the world, many people are known by a single name, and so are said to be [[mononymous person|mononymous]]. Still other cultures lack the concept of specific, fixed names designating people, either individually or collectively. Certain isolated tribes, such as the [[Machiguenga people|Machiguenga]] of the Amazon, do not use personal names.{{efn-lr|The Machiguenga may have nicknames, but generally refer to each other by how they are related.

In [[China]], surnames gradually came into common use beginning in the 3rd century BC (having been common only among the nobility before that). In some areas of East Asia (e.g. Vietnam and Korea), surnames developed in the next several centuries, while in other areas (like Japan), surnames did not become prevalent until the 19th century. In [[Europe]], after the loss of the [[Roman naming conventions|Roman system]], the common use of family names started quite early in some areas ([[France]] in the 13th century, and [[Germany]] in the 16th century), but it often did not happen until much later in areas that used a patronymic naming custom, such as the [[Scandinavia]]n countries, [[Wales]], and some areas of [[Germany]], as well as [[Russia]] and [[Ukraine]]. The compulsory use of surnames varied greatly. France required a priest to write surnames in baptismal records in 1539 (but did not require surnames for Jews, who usually used [[patronymic]]s, until 1808). On the other hand, surnames were not compulsory in the Scandinavian countries until the 19th or 20th century (1923 in [[Norway]]), and [[Iceland]] still [[Icelandic name|does not use surnames]] for its native inhabitants. In [[Spain]], [[Portugal]] and most Latin American countries, two surnames are used, one being the father's family name and the other being the mother's family name. Whereas Spain used to put the father's family name before the mother's family name, Portugal and Brazil keep the inverse order but use the father's family name as the principal one. A Portuguese man named Ant\u00f3nio de Oliveira Guterres would therefore be known commonly as [[Ant\u00f3nio Guterres]]. In Spain, though, the second surname is frequently used if the first one is too common to allow an easy identification. For example, Prime Minister [[Jos\u00e9 Luis Rodr\u00edguez Zapatero]] is often called [[Zapatero]]. In most of the cultures of the Middle East and South Asia, surnames were not generally used until European influence took hold in the 19th century.\n* In many families, single or multiple [[middle name]]s are simply alternative names, names honoring an ancestor or relative, or, for married women, sometimes their maiden names. In some traditions, however, the roles of the first and middle given names are reversed, with the first given name being used to honor a family member and the middle name being used as the usual method to address someone informally. Many [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] families choose a [[saint]]'s name as their child's middle name or this can be left until the child's [[Confirmation (sacrament)|confirmation]] when they choose a saint's name for themselves. Cultures that use [[patronymic]]s or [[matronymic]]s will often give middle names to distinguish between two similarly named people: e.g., Einar Karl Stef\u00e1nsson and Einar Gu\u00f0mundur Stef\u00e1nsson. This is especially done in Iceland (as shown in example) where people are known and referred to almost exclusively by their given name/s.\n\nSome people (called ''anonyms'') choose to be [[Anonymity|anonymous]], that is, to hide their true names, for fear of governmental prosecution or social ridicule of their works or actions. Another method to disguise one's identity is to employ a [[pseudonym]].\n\nFor some people, their name is a single word, known as a [[mononym]]. This can be true from birth, or occur later in life. For example, [[Teller (entertainer)|Teller]], of the magician duo [[Penn and Teller]], was named Raymond Joseph Teller at birth, but changed his name both legally and socially to be simply \"Teller\". In some official government documents, such as his [[driver's license]], his given name is listed as ''NFN'', an initialism for \"no first name\".\n\nThe [[Inuit]] believe that the [[Soul (spirit)|souls]] of the [[namesake]]s are one, so they traditionally refer to the junior namesakes, not just by the names (''atiq''), but also by [[kinship]] title, which applies across gender and generation without implications of disrespect or seniority. In [[Judaism]], someone's name is considered intimately connected with his fate, and adding a name (e.g. on the sickbed) may avert a particular danger. Among [[Ashkenazi Jews]] it is also considered bad luck to take the name of a living ancestor, as the [[Death (personification)#In Judaism|Angel of Death]] may mistake the younger person for his namesake (although there is no such custom among [[Sephardi Jews]]). Jews may also have a Jewish name for intra-community use and use a different name when engaging with the [[goyim|Gentile]] world.\n\nChinese children are called diminutive or pejorative names to make them appear worthless to evil spirits. They receive a definitive name as they grow up.{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}} [[Chinese emperor|Chinese]] and [[Japanese emperor]]s receive [[posthumous name]]s.\n\nIn some [[Polynesian culture]]s, the name of a deceased chief becomes [[taboo]].

The French developed the method of putting the term by which the person is referred in [[small capital]] letters. It is this habit which transferred to names of the Far East, as seen below.

[[Icelandic name|Icelandic system]] is still patronymic.\n* More complex systems like [[Arabic name|Arabic system]], consisting of [[paedonymic]] (son's name), given name, patronymic and one or two bynames.\n\nDifferent cultures have different conventions for personal names. This is a list of articles about particular cultures' naming conventions.\n\n== Name order ==<!-- This section is linked from [[Given name]] and [[Family name]] -->\n[[File:MomoiExpoCrop.png|thumb|[[Haruko Momoi]] at the [[Anime Expo]] 2007 in [[Los Angeles]]; her name card features a spelling of her [[Japanese name|name]] (\"Halko Momoi\") written in Western order; in Japanese her name is {{Nihongo2|\u6843\u4e95\u306f\u308b\u3053}} ''Momoi Haruko'']]\n\n===Western name order===\nThe order ''given name, family name'' is commonly known as the Western order and is usually used in most [[Europe]]an countries and in countries that have cultures predominantly influenced by Western Europe (e.g. [[North America|North]] and [[South America|South]] [[Americas|America]], [[North India|North]], [[East India|East]], [[Central India|Central]] and [[Western India|West India]], [[Australia]], [[New Zealand]] and the [[Philippines]]).\n\nWithin alphabetic lists and catalogs, however, the family name is generally put first, with the given name(s) following, separated from it by a [[comma]] (e.g. Smith, John), representing the \"lexical name order\". This convention is followed by most Western libraries, as well as on many administrative forms.\n\n===Eastern name order===\nThe order ''family name, given name'' is commonly known as the Eastern order and is primarily used in [[East Asia]] (for example in [[China]], [[Japan]] and [[Korea]]), as well as in [[Southeast Asia]] ([[Cambodia]] and [[Vietnam]]), and [[South India|Southern]] and North-Eastern parts of India, and also in [[Hungarian names|Hungary]].\n\nWhen East Asian names are [[transliteration|transliterated]] into the [[Latin alphabet]], some people prefer to convert them to the Western order, while others leave them in the Eastern order but write the family name in [[letter case|capital letters]]. To avoid confusion, there is a convention in some language communities, e.g. French, to write the family name in all capitals when engaging in formal correspondence or writing for an international audience. In Hungarian, the Eastern order of Japanese names is officially kept and Hungarian transliteration is used (e.g. Mijazaki Hajao), but Western name order is also sometimes used with English transliteration (e.g. Hayao Miyazaki).\n\nChinese people, except for those traveling or living outside of China and areas influenced by China, rarely reverse their Chinese language names to the western naming order (given name, then family name), but some may have non-Chinese given names which may use a different order.{{Citation needed|reason=reliable source needed for the whole sentence|date=October 2013}} Western publications usually preserve the Chinese naming order, with the family name first, followed by the given name. In regard to Japanese names, most foreign publications reverse the names of modern individuals, and most Japanese reverse their own names when creating materials for foreign consumption.<ref>Terry, Edith. ''How Asia Got Rich: Japan, China and the Asian Miracle''. [[M.E. Sharpe]], 2002. [https://archive.org/details/howasiagotrichja0000terr/page/632 <!-- quote=\"Japanese names\" surname. --> 632]. Retrieved from [[Google Books]] on 7 August 2011. {{ISBN|0-7656-0356-X}}, {{ISBN|9780765603562}}.</ref> In popular journalism publications, western order is used for Japanese names.<ref name=\"Saeki\">Saeki, Shizuka. \"First Name Terms.\" ''[[Look Japan]]''. June 2001. Volume 47, No. 543. p. 35.</ref>\n\nJapanese names of contemporary people and Hungarian names are usually \"switched\" when people who have such names are mentioned in media in Western countries; for example, ''Koizumi Jun'ichir\u014d'' is known as [[Junichiro Koizumi]] in English, and Pusk\u00e1s Ferenc is known as [[Ferenc Pusk\u00e1s]]. But Chinese, Korean and Vietnamese names are usually left in East Asian order; for instance, in English, M\u00e1o Z\u00e9d\u014dng is known as [[Mao Zedong]] or Mao Tse-tung.\n\nNames of Japanese or Chinese sportspeople generally follow the above conventions. For Japanese examples, see [[Ichiro Suzuki]] instead of ''Suzuki Ichir\u014d'' (although he is widely known simply as \"Ichiro\" in both Japan and North America), or [[Hidetoshi Nakata]] instead of ''Nakata Hidetoshi''. As for Chinese sportspeople, ''Y\u00e1o M\u00edng'' is [[Yao Ming]] and ''Li\u00fa Xi\u00e1ng'' is [[Liu Xiang (hurdler)|Liu Xiang]] in the West.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}\n\nNames of Korean sportspeople may be rendered in East Asian or Western order in Western countries, apparently depending on the sport. For example, names of Korean [[football (soccer)|footballers]] and most [[Sportsperson|athletes]] are usually left in East Asian order (e.g. [[Ahn Jung-hwan]], [[Hong Myung-bo]], [[Park Ji-Sung]], [[Sohn Kee-chung]], [[Hwang Young-cho]]). [[Baseball]], [[billiards]], [[golf]], and [[ice hockey]] players' names are usually changed to Western order (for example: baseball player Park Chan-Ho is referred to in the West as [[Chan-ho Park]], and the female golfer Pak Se-ri is known in the West as [[Se-Ri Pak]]). Confusion can be avoided by noticing that in all the above cases, the words linked by a hyphen are the given name.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}\n\n[[Mordvins]] use two names - a Mordvin name and a Russian name. The Mordvin name is written in the Eastern name order. Usually, the Mordvin surname is the same as the Russian surname, for example [[Aleksandr Sharonov|Sharonon Sandra]] (Russian: Alexander Sharonov), but it can be different at times, for example [[Yovlan Olo]] (Russian: Vladimir Romashkin).\n\nMongolians use the Eastern naming order (patronymic followed by given name), which is also used there when rendering the names of other East Asians and Hungarians. Russian and other Western names, however, are still written in Western order.\n\n==Non-human personal names==\nApart from the [[Linnaean taxonomy]], some humans give individual non-human animals and plants names, usually of endearment.\n\n===Names of pets===\nPet names often reflect the owner's view of the animal, and their expectations they have for their companion.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=ISnH9lrVYhYC&pg=PA127 The complete idiot's guide to pet psychic communication], Debbie McGillivray, Eve Adamson, Alpha Books, 2004, {{ISBN|1-59257-214-6}}, {{ISBN|978-1-59257-214-4}}</ref><ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=VoxbJ_oF7LAC&pg=PA10 Adopting a Pet For Dummies] Page 10, By Eve Adamson</ref> It has been argued that giving names allows researchers to view their pets as [[ontologically]] different from unnamed [[laboratory animal]]s with which they work.<ref>[https://doi.org/10.1007%2FBF02393497 Proper names and the social construction of biography: The negative case of laboratory animals], Mary T.

This has been shown to reflect the owner having a human-like relationship with the pet.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=ekn0Zm2jUBgC&pg=PA13 The Best Pet Name Book Ever!], Chapter 3, By Wayne Bryant Eldridge</ref>\n\nIn some cultures, [[pet]]s or sporting [[animal]]s are sometimes given names similar to human names. Other cultures, such as the [[Han Chinese|Chinese]], give animals nonhuman names because it would be seen as offensive and disrespectful to the person of the same name.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}\n\n===Dolphin names for each other===\nA study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences claims that humans are not the only animals that use personal names.
