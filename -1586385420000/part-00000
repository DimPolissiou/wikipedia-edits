This boundary has been disputed with Oromia's neighbors in a number of cases, most notably between Oromia and the [[Somali Region]]. One attempt to resolve the dispute between the two regions was the October 2004 referendum held in about 420 [[kebele]]s in 12 [[woreda]]s across five zones of the Somali Region. According to the official results of the referendum, about 80% of the disputed areas have fallen under Oromia administration, though there were allegations of voting irregularities in many of them.<ref>[http://www.internal-displacement.org/idmc/website/countries.nsf/(httpEnvelopes)/AA0C62769222BE31802570B8005A6F3B?OpenDocument \"Somali-Oromo border referendum of December 2004\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090430113732/http://www.internal-displacement.org/idmc/website/countries.nsf/%28httpEnvelopes%29/AA0C62769222BE31802570B8005A6F3B?OpenDocument |date=30 April 2009 }}, Internal Displacement Monitoring Centre website (accessed 11 February 2009)</ref> The results led over the following weeks to minorities in these kebeles being pressured to leave.

This boundary has been disputed with Oromia's neighbors in a number of cases, most notably between Oromia and the [[Somali Region]]. One attempt to resolve the dispute between the two regions was the October 2004 referendum held in about 420 [[kebele]]s in 12 [[woreda]]s across five zones of the Somali Region. According to the official results of the referendum, about 80% of the disputed areas have fallen under Oromia administration, though there were allegations of voting irregularities in many of them.<ref>[http://www.internal-displacement.org/idmc/website/countries.nsf/(httpEnvelopes)/AA0C62769222BE31802570B8005A6F3B?OpenDocument \"Somali-Oromo border referendum of December 2004\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090430113732/http://www.internal-displacement.org/idmc/website/countries.nsf/%28httpEnvelopes%29/AA0C62769222BE31802570B8005A6F3B?OpenDocument |date=30 April 2009 }}, Internal Displacement Monitoring Centre website (accessed 11 February 2009)</ref> The results led over the following weeks to minorities in these kebeles being pressured to leave.

{"title_page": "St. Lucia's flood", "text_new": "{{short description|A storm tide that affected the Netherlands and Northern Germany on 14 December 1287}}\n{{refimprove|date=December 2016}}\n'''St. Lucia's flood''' ('''Sint-Luciavloed''') was a [[Storm tides of the North Sea|storm tide]] that affected the [[Netherlands]] and [[Northern Germany]] on 14 December 1287 ([[Old Style and New Style dates|OS]]), the day after [[St. Lucia Day]], killing approximately 50,000 to 80,000 people in one of the [[List of deadliest floods|largest floods in recorded history]].\n\nMeteorologically this disaster was similar to the [[North Sea flood of 1953]], when an extreme low pressure system coinciding with a high tide caused a huge storm surge. The St. Lucia flood had a major influence on the subsequent history of the Netherlands.\n\n==Zuiderzee came into existence==\nThe name [[Zuider Zee|Zuiderzee]] \"Southern Sea\" (from a Frisian perspective) dates from after this event, as the water had before been a [[freshwater]] [[Lake Flevo|lake]] that was only directly connected to the [[North Sea]] by the former river [[Vlie]]. The St. Lucia's flood removed the last of a series of natural sandy ([[dunes]]) and [[boulder clay]] barriers after which the new, now [[seawater|salty]] Zuiderzee came into existence and grew rapidly, this since the [[mires|peatlands]] behind the barriers that had disappeared were mostly not protected anymore against erosion from the sea. The coming into existence of the Zuiderzee was the undoing of the powerful medieval trading city of [[Stavoren]] at the rightbank of the now disappearing river Vlie and the making of first the [[IJssel]] [[Hanseatic League|Hanse]]-cities of [[Kampen, Overijssel|Kampen]], [[Zwolle]], [[Deventer]], [[Zutphen]] and [[Doesburg]] and later the anti-Hanseatic city of [[Amsterdam]], that began its rise from nothing almost immediately after the St. Lucia's flood.\n\n==Netherlands (West-Frisia and Frisia proper)==\nMuch land was permanently flooded in what is now the [[Waddenzee]] and [[IJsselmeer]]. It especially affected the north and northwestern part of the Netherlands, particularly the current provinces of [[Noord-Holland]] and [[Friesland]]. \n\nThe island of [[Griend]] in the current [[Waddenzee]] was almost completely destroyed, only ten houses being left standing. After the flood [[Harlingen, Friesland|Harlingen]], about fifteen miles southeast of Griend and formerly landlocked, came into existence as the new [[port|seaport]] of Friesland, a role it kept for seven centuries.\n\nThe only part of the current northwestern Netherlands, apart from the western [[Dune]]s area (the old Dutch heartland) and the [[Frisian Islands]] that escaped annihilation was [[West Friesland (region)|West-Friesland]], since this area was already protected by a [[Westfriese Omringdijk|ringdike]] that mostly held and where  not, could be repaired after the floods receded. Shortly after the [[St. Lucia Day]] disaster, the West-Frisia, now separated from the rest of [[Friesland]] by a [[strait]] of around 10 miles at its narrowest, was annexed by the [[county of Holland]], expanding this county northwards. The flood also brought to an end a series of wars (the \"[[Friso-Hollandic Wars|West-Friese oorlogen]]\") that lasted around 200 years. Shortly after this conquest the West-Frisian cities of [[Hoorn]] and [[Enkhuizen]] began their rise to prominence that reached a pinnacle in the early 17th century.\n\n==In Germany (mostly East Frisia)==\nThe [[Chronicle]]s speak of 50,000 killed{{where|date=October 2018}} and total destruction. Many villages disappeared forever. In the current district of [[East-Frisia]] alone thirty villages disappeared in the North Sea. Also a first stage of the [[Dollart]] came into existence. Because of the large loss of land and the relative insecurity of living in the now far more unprotected peatlands, since natural barriers had been removed by the flood, many survivors gave up their ways of living in the fertile peatlands and moved to the [[Geest]].\n\n==In England==\nAlthough not known by the name of St. Lucia, the same storm also had devastating effects on the other side of the North Sea in England.

Contrary to the American usage of the term, it is characterised by strongly [[bilateral symmetry]], with an [[Italianate]] or [[Palladian]]-derived pediment on the front formal elevation.\n\nThe architectural historian [[Marcus Binney]], writing in ''[[The Times]]'' in 2006, describes [[Poulton House]] in [[Poulton, Wiltshire]] (built in 1706, during the reign of Queen Anne)<ref>[https://historicengland.org.uk/listing/the-list/list-entry/1034116 Poulton House]</ref><ref>{{cite book |last1=Pevsner |first1=Nikolaus |authorlink1=Nikolaus Pevsner |last2=Cherry |first2=Bridget (revision) |year=1975 |origyear=1963 |title=Wiltshire |series=[[Pevsner Architectural Guides#Buildings of England|The Buildings of England]] |edition=2nd |place=Harmondsworth |publisher=[[Penguin Books]] |isbn=0-14-0710-26-4 |page=336}}</ref> as \"...Queen Anne at its most delightful\". Binney lists what he describes as the typical features of the Queen Anne style:<ref>''[[The Times]]'', \"Bricks and Mortar\"  Supplement, 5 May 2006, pp.6-7.</ref>\n* a sweep of steps leading to a carved stone door-case\n* rows of painted sash windows in boxes set flush with the brickwork\n* stone [[Quoin (architecture)|quoins]] emphasizing corners\n* a central triangular pediment set against a hipped roof with dormers\n* typically box-like \"double pile\" plans, two rooms deep\n\nWhen used of revived \"Queen Anne style\" of the 19th and 20th centuries, the historic reference in the name should not be taken at all literally, as buildings said to be in the \"Queen Anne style\" in other parts of the [[English-speaking world]] normally bear even less resemblance to English buildings of the early 18th century as those of any style of [[revival architecture]] to the original. In particular, [[Queen Anne style architecture in the United States]] is a wholly different style, as is that in Australia, and normally includes no elements very typical of the actual architecture of Queen Anne's reign, the names having been devised for marketing purposes.\n\n==British 19th-century Queen Anne style==\n[[George Devey]] (1820\u20131886) and the better-known [[Richard Norman Shaw|Norman Shaw]] (1831\u20131912) popularized the Queen Anne style of British architecture of the [[industrial age]] in the 1870s. Norman Shaw published a book of architectural sketches as early as 1858, and his evocative pen-and-ink drawings began to appear in trade journals and artistic magazines in the 1870s. (American commercial builders quickly adopted the style.)\n\nShaw's eclectic designs often included [[Tudor architecture|Tudor]] elements, and this \"Old English\" style also became popular in the United States, where it became known (inaccurately) as the Queen Anne style. Confusion between buildings constructed during the reign of Queen Anne and the \"Queen Anne\" style still persists, especially in England.\n\nIn the late 1850s, the name \"Queen Anne\" was in the air,{{citation needed|date=September 2012}} following publication in 1852 of  [[William Makepeace Thackeray]]'s novel, ''[[The History of Henry Esmond|The History of Henry Esmond, Esq., A Colonel in the Service of Her Majesty Queen Anne]]''. One minor side-effect of Thackeray's novel and of Norman Shaw's freehand picturesque vernacular [[Renaissance architecture|Renaissance]] survives to this day. When, in the early 1870s, Chinese-inspired Early Georgian furniture on [[cabriole leg]]s, featuring smooth expanses of walnut and chairs with flowing lines and slat backs, began to be looked for in out-of-the-way curio shops (Macquoid 1904), the style was mis-attributed to the reign of Queen Anne, and the \"Queen Anne\" misnomer has stuck to this day, in American as well as English furniture-style designations (see [[Queen Anne style furniture]]). Even the most stylish and up-to-date furnishings of the historical reign of Queen Anne, as inventories reveal, used a style that 21st-century connoisseurs would immediately identify as \"[[William and Mary style|William and Mary]]\".\n\nThe British Victorian version of the style empathises more closely with the [[Arts and Crafts movement]] than does its American counterpart. A good example is [[Severalls Hospital]] in Colchester, Essex (1913\u20131997), now defunct.\n\nThe historic precedents of the Queen Anne style were broad:\n* fine brickwork, often in a warmer, softer finish than the Victorians characteristically used, varied with terracotta panels, or tile-hung upper stories, with crisply-painted white woodwork, or blond limestone detailing\n* [[oriel window]]s, often stacked one above another\n* corner towers\n* asymmetrical fronts and picturesque massing\n* Flemish [[mannerism|mannerist]] sunken panels of [[strapwork]]\n* deeply shadowed entrances\n* broad porches\n* overall, a domesticated free Renaissance style\n\n[[Image:County Hall (1898), Wood Street, Wakefield.jpg|thumb|right|[[County Hall, Wakefield]], designed by architects [[James Glen Sivewright Gibson|James Gibson]] and Samuel Russell in 1894]]\nWhen an open architectural competition took place in 1892 for a [[Seat of local government|county hall]] to be built in [[Wakefield]], in the West Riding of Yorkshire, the instructions to competitors noted that \"the style of architecture will be left to the competitors but the Queen Anne or Renaissance School of Architecture appears suited to an old town like Wakefield\".<ref>County Council Records, 11 January 1893; Papers ''Building of County Hall''</ref> The [[County Hall, Wakefield|executed design]], by architects [[James Glen Sivewright Gibson|James Gibson]] and Samuel Russell of London, combines a corner turret, grandly domed and with [[gargoyle]]s at the angles, freely combined with Flemish Renaissance stepped gables.\n\nIn the 20th century, [[Edwin Lutyens]] and others used an elegant version of the style, usually with red-brick walls contrasting with pale stone details.\n\n==Queen Anne Revival in other countries==\n{{Main|Queen Anne Revival architecture}}\n\n===American Queen Anne style===\n{{Main|Queen Anne style architecture in the United States}}\n[[File:Carson mansion.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Carson Mansion]], located in [[Eureka, California|Eureka]], [[California]], is widely considered to be one of the highest executions of American Queen Anne style.]]\n\nIn the United States, the so-called \"Queen Anne style\" is loosely used of a wide range of picturesque buildings with \"free Renaissance\" (non-[[Gothic Revival architecture]]) details rather than of a specific formulaic style in its own right. \"Queen Anne\", as an alternative both to the French-derived [[Second Empire (architecture)|Second Empire]] and the less \"domestic\" [[Beaux-Arts architecture]], is broadly applied to architecture, furniture and decorative arts of the period 1880 to 1910; some \"Queen Anne\" architectural elements, such as the wraparound front porch, continued to be found into the 1920s.\n\nThe gabled and domestically scaled \"Queen Anne\" style arrived in New York City with the new housing for the New York House and School of Industry [[Sidney V. Stratton]], architect, 1878). Distinctive features of American Queen Anne style (rooted in the English style) may include an [[asymmetrical]] [[facade|fa\u00e7ade]]; dominant front-facing [[gable]], often [[cantilever]]ed out beyond the plane of the wall below; overhanging [[eaves]]; round, square, or [[polygonal]] tower(s); shaped and [[Dutch gable]]s; a [[porch]] covering part or all of the front facade, including the primary entrance area; a second-story porch or balconies; [[pediment]]ed porches; differing wall textures, such as patterned wood shingles shaped into varying designs, including resembling fish scales, [[terra cotta]] tiles, [[relief]] panels, or wooden shingles over brickwork, etc.; [[dentils]]; classical columns; spindle work; [[Oriel window|oriel]] and bay windows; horizontal bands of leaded windows; monumental chimneys; painted [[balustrade]]s; and wooden or [[slate]] roofs. Front gardens often had wooden fences.\n<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://buffaloah.com/a/archsty/queen/index.html|title=Queen Anne Style|website=buffaloah.com}}</ref>\n\n===Australian Queen Anne style===\n[[File:The Australia (APA) Building, Melbourne.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.8|The [[APA Building, Melbourne|APA Building]] in Melbourne, circa approx 1900. It was Australia's tallest building from its completion in 1889 to 1912 and was demolished in 1980.]]\n{{Main|Federation architecture}}\nIn Australia, the Queen Anne style was absorbed into the [[Federation architecture|Federation style]], which was, broadly speaking, the Australian equivalent of the [[Edwardian architecture|Edwardian style]], derived from the influence of [[Richard Norman Shaw]],<ref>A Pictorial Guide to Identifying Australian Architecture, Apperly (Angus and Robertson) 1994, p.132</ref> an influential British architect of the late [[Victorian era]]. The Federation period went from 1890 to 1915 and included twelve styles, one of which was the [[Federation Queen Anne]]. This became the most popular style for houses built between 1890 and 1910.<ref>A Pictorial Guide to Identifying Australian Architecture, p.132</ref> The style often utilised Tudor-style woodwork and elaborate fretwork that replaced the Victorian taste for wrought iron. Verandahs were usually a feature, as were the image of the rising sun and Australian wildlife; plus circular windows, turrets and towers with conical or pyramid-shaped roofs.\n[[Image:FederationHomeSydney0005.jpg|thumb|right|'Vallambrosa', a Queen Anne Style house located at 19 [[Appian Way, Burwood, Sydney|Appian Way]] in the Sydney suburb of [[Burwood, New South Wales|Burwood]]]]\n[[Image:Federation style mansion in domain street south yarra.jpg|thumb|Queen Anne styled mansion located in [[South Yarra, Victoria|South Yarra]], [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]].]]\nThe first Queen Anne house in Australia was [[Caerleon, Bellevue Hill|Caerleon]] in the suburb of [[Bellevue Hill, New South Wales]].<ref>The Federation House, Hugh Fraser (New Holland) 2002, p.24</ref> Caerleon was designed initially by a Sydney architect, [[Harry Kent (architect)|Harry Kent]], but was then substantially reworked in London by [[Maurice Adams]].<ref>Sydney Architecture, Graham Jahn (Watermark Press) 1997, p.62</ref> This led to some controversy over who deserved the credit. The house was built in 1885 and was the precursor for the Federation Queen Anne house that was to become so popular. The [[APA Building, Melbourne|APA Building]] in the [[Melbourne city centre]] was an example of the Queen Anne style being used for non-residential purposes, though at some stage the building may have been apartments. It was demolished in 1981 after the modernism boom in Melbourne took off\u2013factors that sealed its demolition included rapacious development, lax heritage attitudes in Australian cities, and the owner's own decision to argue for a demolition permit which was granted.\n\nCaerleon was followed soon after by West Maling, in the suburb of [[Penshurst, New South Wales]],<ref>[http://www.heritage.nsw.gov.au/07_subnav_04_2.cfm?itemid=1870222 Heritage branch | NSW Environment & Heritage]</ref> and Annesbury, in the suburb of [[Ashfield, New South Wales]], both built circa 1888. These houses, although built around the same time, had distinct styles, West Maling displaying a robust Tudor influence that was not present in Annesbury. The style soon became increasingly popular, appealing predominantly to reasonably well-off people with an \"Establishment\" leaning.<ref>The Federation House, p.22</ref>\n\nThe style as it developed in Australia was highly eclectic, blending Queen Anne elements with various Australian influences. Old English characteristics like ribbed chimneys and gabled roofs were combined with Australian aspects like encircling verandahs, designed to keep the sun out. One outstanding example of this eclectic approach is [[Urrbrae House]], in the [[Adelaide]] suburb of [[Urrbrae, South Australia]], part of the Waite Institute. Another variation with connections to the Federation Queen Anne style was the [[Federation Bungalow]], featuring extended verandahs. This style generally incorporated familiar Queen Anne elements, but usually in simplified form.\n\nSome prominent examples are:<ref>A Pictorial Guide to Identifying Australian Architecture, pp.132-135</ref>\n* [[West Maling]], corner of Penshurst Avenue and King Georges Road, [[Penshurst, New South Wales|Penshurst]], Sydney\n* Homes, [[Appian Way, Burwood|Appian Way]], [[Burwood, New South Wales|Burwood]], Sydney\n* Homes, [[Haberfield, New South Wales]]\n* [[Caerleon, Bellevue Hill|Caerleon]], 15 Ginahgulla Road, [[Bellevue Hill, New South Wales|Bellevue Hill]], Sydney (sold for $22 million in January 2008)<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.environment.nsw.gov.au/heritageapp/ViewHeritageItemDetails.aspx?ID=2711158|title=Caerleon - house, grounds (Full LEP listing - Description in Further Comments) {{!}} NSW Environment & Heritage|website=www.environment.nsw.gov.au|access-date=2019-08-15}}</ref><ref>Sydney Morning Herald, January 25th 2008, page 3</ref>\n* [[Annesbury]], 78 Alt Street, [[Ashfield, New South Wales|Ashfield]], Sydney<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://federation-house.wikispaces.com/Amesbury,+Ashfield,+NSW|title=Wikispaces|website=federation-house.wikispaces.com|access-date=2019-08-15}}</ref>\n* [[Weld Club]], Barrack Street, Perth\n* [[ANZ Bank]], Queens Parade, Fitzroy North, Melbourne\n* [[Campion College]], Studley Park Road, Kew, Melbourne<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.adonline.id.au/buildings/dalswraith/|title=Dalswraith {{!}} Melbourne Buildings {{!}} Adam Dimech|website=www.adonline.id.au|access-date=2019-08-15}}</ref>\n* [[Redcourt Estate]], Armadale, Melbourne\n* [[Tay Creggan]], Hawthorn, Melbourne<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://federation-house.wikispaces.com/Tay+Creggan,+Hawthorn|title=Wikispaces|website=federation-house.wikispaces.com|access-date=2019-08-15}}</ref>\n\n===Gallery===\n<gallery>\nImage:WestMalingSydney0004.jpg|West Maling, Penshurst NSW\nImage:'Amalfi' 2 Appian Way Burwood.jpg|'Amalfi', 2 Appian Way Burwood NSW\nImage:'Vallambrosa' 19 Appian Way Burwood NSW.jpg|'Vallambrosa' 19 Appian Way Burwood NSW\nImage:Burwood Appian Way 2.JPG|Burwood Appian Way\nImage:SLNSW 796381 The Manse Haberfield Federation style house.jpg|The Manse Haberfield Federation style house\nImage:(1)Caerleon-3.jpg|Caerleon, Bellevue Hill, Sydney NSW\nImage:Weld club2.jpg|Weld Club, Perth WA\nImage:Queens_Bess.jpg|Queen Bess Row in [[East Melbourne, Victoria|East Melbourne]]\nImage:RedCourt-Exterior-01.jpg|Redcourt, Armadale, Victoria, Australia\nImage:Edzett Mansion Toorak.jpeg|Edzell Mansion, Toorak Victoria\nFile:1907 Postcard of Elmcroft in Smiths Falls.jpg|[[Elmcroft]], [[Smiths Falls, Ontario]]\n</gallery>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Queen Anne style furniture]]\n* [[Ramsbury Manor]]\n* [[Revivalism (architecture)]]\n* [[Architecture of England#Stuart architecture|Stuart architecture]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n* [[Mark Girouard|Girouard, Mark]], ''Sweetness and Light: The Queen Anne Movement, 1860\u20131900'', Yale University Press, 1984.

When, in the early 1870s, Chinese-inspired Early Georgian furniture on [[cabriole leg]]s, featuring smooth expanses of walnut and chairs with flowing lines and slat backs, began to be looked for in out-of-the-way curio shops (Macquoid 1904), the style was mis-attributed to the reign of Queen Anne, and the \"Queen Anne\" misnomer has stuck to this day, in American as well as English furniture-style designations (see [[Queen Anne style furniture]]). Even the most stylish and up-to-date furnishings of the historical reign of Queen Anne, as inventories reveal, used a style that 21st-century connoisseurs would immediately identify as \"[[William and Mary style|William and Mary]]\".\n\nThe British Victorian version of the style empathises more closely with the [[Arts and Crafts movement]] than does its American counterpart. A good example is [[Severalls Hospital]] in Colchester, Essex (1913\u20131997), now defunct.\n\nThe historic precedents of the Queen Anne style were broad:\n* fine brickwork, often in a warmer, softer finish than the Victorians characteristically used, varied with terracotta panels, or tile-hung upper stories, with crisply-painted white woodwork, or blond limestone detailing\n* [[oriel window]]s, often stacked one above another\n* corner towers\n* asymmetrical fronts and picturesque massing\n* Flemish [[mannerism|mannerist]] sunken panels of [[strapwork]]\n* deeply shadowed entrances\n* broad porches\n* overall, a domesticated free Renaissance style\n\n[[Image:County Hall (1898), Wood Street, Wakefield.jpg|thumb|right|[[County Hall, Wakefield]], designed by architects [[James Glen Sivewright Gibson|James Gibson]] and Samuel Russell in 1894]]\nWhen an open architectural competition took place in 1892 for a [[Seat of local government|county hall]] to be built in [[Wakefield]], in the West Riding of Yorkshire, the instructions to competitors noted that \"the style of architecture will be left to the competitors but the Queen Anne or Renaissance School of Architecture appears suited to an old town like Wakefield\".<ref>County Council Records, 11 January 1893; Papers ''Building of County Hall''</ref> The [[County Hall, Wakefield|executed design]], by architects [[James Glen Sivewright Gibson|James Gibson]] and Samuel Russell of London, combines a corner turret, grandly domed and with [[gargoyle]]s at the angles, freely combined with Flemish Renaissance stepped gables.\n\nIn the 20th century, [[Edwin Lutyens]] and others used an elegant version of the style, usually with red-brick walls contrasting with pale stone details.\n\n==Queen Anne Revival in other countries==\n{{Main|Queen Anne Revival architecture}}\n\n===American Queen Anne style===\n{{Main|Queen Anne style architecture in the United States}}\n[[File:Carson mansion.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Carson Mansion]], located in [[Eureka, California|Eureka]], [[California]], is widely considered to be one of the highest executions of American Queen Anne style.]]\n\nIn the United States, the so-called \"Queen Anne style\" is loosely used of a wide range of picturesque buildings with \"free Renaissance\" (non-[[Gothic Revival architecture]]) details rather than of a specific formulaic style in its own right. \"Queen Anne\", as an alternative both to the French-derived [[Second Empire (architecture)|Second Empire]] and the less \"domestic\" [[Beaux-Arts architecture]], is broadly applied to architecture, furniture and decorative arts of the period 1880 to 1910; some \"Queen Anne\" architectural elements, such as the wraparound front porch, continued to be found into the 1920s.\n\nThe gabled and domestically scaled \"Queen Anne\" style arrived in New York City with the new housing for the New York House and School of Industry [[Sidney V. Stratton]], architect, 1878). Distinctive features of American Queen Anne style (rooted in the English style) may include an [[asymmetrical]] [[facade|fa\u00e7ade]]; dominant front-facing [[gable]], often [[cantilever]]ed out beyond the plane of the wall below; overhanging [[eaves]]; round, square, or [[polygonal]] tower(s); shaped and [[Dutch gable]]s; a [[porch]] covering part or all of the front facade, including the primary entrance area; a second-story porch or balconies; [[pediment]]ed porches; differing wall textures, such as patterned wood shingles shaped into varying designs, including resembling fish scales, [[terra cotta]] tiles, [[relief]] panels, or wooden shingles over brickwork, etc.; [[dentils]]; classical columns; spindle work; [[Oriel window|oriel]] and bay windows; horizontal bands of leaded windows; monumental chimneys; painted [[balustrade]]s; and wooden or [[slate]] roofs. Front gardens often had wooden fences.\n<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://buffaloah.com/a/archsty/queen/index.html|title=Queen Anne Style|website=buffaloah.com}}</ref>\n\n===Australian Queen Anne style===\n[[File:The Australia (APA) Building, Melbourne.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.8|The [[APA Building, Melbourne|APA Building]] in Melbourne, circa approx 1900. It was Australia's tallest building from its completion in 1889 to 1912 and was demolished in 1980.]]\n{{Main|Federation architecture}}\nIn Australia, the Queen Anne style was absorbed into the [[Federation architecture|Federation style]], which was, broadly speaking, the Australian equivalent of the [[Edwardian architecture|Edwardian style]], derived from the influence of [[Richard Norman Shaw]],<ref>A Pictorial Guide to Identifying Australian Architecture, Apperly (Angus and Robertson) 1994, p.132</ref> an influential British architect of the late [[Victorian era]]. The Federation period went from 1890 to 1915 and included twelve styles, one of which was the [[Federation Queen Anne]]. This became the most popular style for houses built between 1890 and 1910.<ref>A Pictorial Guide to Identifying Australian Architecture, p.132</ref> The style often utilised Tudor-style woodwork and elaborate fretwork that replaced the Victorian taste for wrought iron. Verandahs were usually a feature, as were the image of the rising sun and Australian wildlife; plus circular windows, turrets and towers with conical or pyramid-shaped roofs.\n[[Image:FederationHomeSydney0005.jpg|thumb|right|'Vallambrosa', a Queen Anne Style house located at 19 [[Appian Way, Burwood, Sydney|Appian Way]] in the Sydney suburb of [[Burwood, New South Wales|Burwood]]]]\n[[Image:Federation style mansion in domain street south yarra.jpg|thumb|Queen Anne styled mansion located in [[South Yarra, Victoria|South Yarra]], [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]].]]\nThe first Queen Anne house in Australia was [[Caerleon, Bellevue Hill|Caerleon]] in the suburb of [[Bellevue Hill, New South Wales]].<ref>The Federation House, Hugh Fraser (New Holland) 2002, p.24</ref> Caerleon was designed initially by a Sydney architect, [[Harry Kent (architect)|Harry Kent]], but was then substantially reworked in London by [[Maurice Adams]].<ref>Sydney Architecture, Graham Jahn (Watermark Press) 1997, p.62</ref> This led to some controversy over who deserved the credit. The house was built in 1885 and was the precursor for the Federation Queen Anne house that was to become so popular. The [[APA Building, Melbourne|APA Building]] in the [[Melbourne city centre]] was an example of the Queen Anne style being used for non-residential purposes, though at some stage the building may have been apartments. It was demolished in 1981 after the modernism boom in Melbourne took off\u2013factors that sealed its demolition included rapacious development, lax heritage attitudes in Australian cities, and the owner's own decision to argue for a demolition permit which was granted.\n\nCaerleon was followed soon after by West Maling, in the suburb of [[Penshurst, New South Wales]],<ref>[http://www.heritage.nsw.gov.au/07_subnav_04_2.cfm?itemid=1870222 Heritage branch | NSW Environment & Heritage]</ref> and Annesbury, in the suburb of [[Ashfield, New South Wales]], both built circa 1888. These houses, although built around the same time, had distinct styles, West Maling displaying a robust Tudor influence that was not present in Annesbury. The style soon became increasingly popular, appealing predominantly to reasonably well-off people with an \"Establishment\" leaning.<ref>The Federation House, p.22</ref>\n\nThe style as it developed in Australia was highly eclectic, blending Queen Anne elements with various Australian influences. Old English characteristics like ribbed chimneys and gabled roofs were combined with Australian aspects like encircling verandahs, designed to keep the sun out. One outstanding example of this eclectic approach is [[Urrbrae House]], in the [[Adelaide]] suburb of [[Urrbrae, South Australia]], part of the Waite Institute. Another variation with connections to the Federation Queen Anne style was the [[Federation Bungalow]], featuring extended verandahs. This style generally incorporated familiar Queen Anne elements, but usually in simplified form.\n\nSome prominent examples are:<ref>A Pictorial Guide to Identifying Australian Architecture, pp.132-135</ref>\n* [[West Maling]], corner of Penshurst Avenue and King Georges Road, [[Penshurst, New South Wales|Penshurst]], Sydney\n* Homes, [[Appian Way, Burwood|Appian Way]], [[Burwood, New South Wales|Burwood]], Sydney\n* Homes, [[Haberfield, New South Wales]]\n* [[Caerleon, Bellevue Hill|Caerleon]], 15 Ginahgulla Road, [[Bellevue Hill, New South Wales|Bellevue Hill]], Sydney (sold for $22 million in January 2008)<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.environment.nsw.gov.au/heritageapp/ViewHeritageItemDetails.aspx?ID=2711158|title=Caerleon - house, grounds (Full LEP listing - Description in Further Comments) {{!}} NSW Environment & Heritage|website=www.environment.nsw.gov.au|access-date=2019-08-15}}</ref><ref>Sydney Morning Herald, January 25th 2008, page 3</ref>\n* [[Annesbury]], 78 Alt Street, [[Ashfield, New South Wales|Ashfield]], Sydney<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://federation-house.wikispaces.com/Amesbury,+Ashfield,+NSW|title=Wikispaces|website=federation-house.wikispaces.com|access-date=2019-08-15}}</ref>\n* [[Weld Club]], Barrack Street, Perth\n* [[ANZ Bank]], Queens Parade, Fitzroy North, Melbourne\n* [[Campion College]], Studley Park Road, Kew, Melbourne<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.adonline.id.au/buildings/dalswraith/|title=Dalswraith {{!}} Melbourne Buildings {{!}} Adam Dimech|website=www.adonline.id.au|access-date=2019-08-15}}</ref>\n* [[Redcourt Estate]], Armadale, Melbourne\n* [[Tay Creggan]], Hawthorn, Melbourne<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://federation-house.wikispaces.com/Tay+Creggan,+Hawthorn|title=Wikispaces|website=federation-house.wikispaces.com|access-date=2019-08-15}}</ref>\n\n===Gallery===\n<gallery>\nImage:WestMalingSydney0004.jpg|West Maling, Penshurst NSW\nImage:'Amalfi' 2 Appian Way Burwood.jpg|'Amalfi', 2 Appian Way Burwood NSW\nImage:'Vallambrosa' 19 Appian Way Burwood NSW.jpg|'Vallambrosa' 19 Appian Way Burwood NSW\nImage:Burwood Appian Way 2.JPG|Burwood Appian Way\nImage:SLNSW 796381 The Manse Haberfield Federation style house.jpg|The Manse Haberfield Federation style house\nImage:(1)Caerleon-3.jpg|Caerleon, Bellevue Hill, Sydney NSW\nImage:Weld club2.jpg|Weld Club, Perth WA\nImage:Queens_Bess.jpg|Queen Bess Row in [[East Melbourne, Victoria|East Melbourne]]\nImage:RedCourt-Exterior-01.jpg|Redcourt, Armadale, Victoria, Australia\nImage:Edzett Mansion Toorak.jpeg|Edzell Mansion, Toorak Victoria\nFile:1907 Postcard of Elmcroft in Smiths Falls.jpg|[[Elmcroft]], [[Smiths Falls, Ontario]]\n</gallery>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Queen Anne style furniture]]\n* [[Ramsbury Manor]]\n* [[Revivalism (architecture)]]\n* [[Shingle style architecture]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n* [[Mark Girouard|Girouard, Mark]], ''Sweetness and Light: The Queen Anne Movement, 1860\u20131900'', Yale University Press, 1984.

It also furthered her growing penchant for writing topical songs about social issues. \n\nThe album was recorded at the Hit Factory, Sigma Sound, Messina Sound, Right Track, The Enchanted Cottage, The Ranch, and World Famous Orbit Sound. It was co-produced by dance-music artist [[Junior Vasquez]] and is highly typical of his work of the time; as such, many of the songs are held together by synthetic loops and percussion. Lyrics address issues like [[abortion]] (\"[[Sally's Pigeons]]\"), [[racism]] (\"A Part Hate\"), [[spousal abuse]] (\"Product of Misery\" and \"Broken Glass\") and [[incest]] (\"Lies\"). The track \"Product of Misery\" was inspired by a teacher of Lauper's, Bob Barrell, who described the masses of struggling people as a 'product of misery' and that misery begets misery unless the chain is broken.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Cyndi Lauper: A Memoir|last=Lauper|first=Cyndi|last2=Dunn|first2=Jancee|publisher=Simon & Schuster|year=2012|isbn=978-1-4711-1424-3|location=Great Britain|pages=39|quote=|via=}}</ref> The song \"A Part Hate\" was conceived as an anti-[[apartheid]] song and was originally written for Lauper's second album ''[[True Colors (Cyndi Lauper album)|True Colors]]'' but was not included because her label felt it would make the album too political; it already had a cover of [[Marvin Gaye]]'s \"[[What's Going On (song)|What's Going On]]\" and the [[True Colors (Cyndi Lauper song)|title track]] included.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Cyndi Lauper: A Memoir|last=Lauper|first=Cyndi|last2=Dunn|first2=Jancee|publisher=Simon & Schuster|year=2012|isbn=978-1-4711-1424-3|location=Great Britain|pages=166|quote=|via=}}</ref>\n\nThe album cover was inspired by a photograph of the actress [[Mary Pickford]], taken by photographer Nelson Evans.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-kdAq9xYhM4I/Tqkul4yO2gI/AAAAAAAAD3M/R5ZlKcyx8bQ/s1600/1917_nelsonevans_marypickford.jpg|title=Picture of Mary Pickford,taken by Nelson Evans|accessdate=June 5, 2013|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130628184717/http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-kdAq9xYhM4I/Tqkul4yO2gI/AAAAAAAAD3M/R5ZlKcyx8bQ/s1600/1917_nelsonevans_marypickford.jpg|archivedate=28 June 2013|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nLauper has commented that she wishes that her vocals on the project had been sharper. She worked with a vocal coach to sharpen her vocals for her next studio album ''[[Sisters of Avalon]]'', and mentions this in the liner notes.\n\n==Commercial performance==\nThe album had limited success due to lack of promotion on the part of Cyndi's label. It was considered a commercial disappointment in the [[United States]] and despite some positive critical reviews it stalled at No. 112 on the ''Billboard'' 200 albums chart. As of 2003, the album has sold 119,000 copies in the US, according to [[Nielsen SoundScan]].\n\nThe album fared better overseas, becoming most successful in Japan and France, achieving a Gold certification in both countries.

It also furthered her growing penchant for writing topical songs about social issues. \n\nThe album was recorded at the Hit Factory, Sigma Sound, Messina Sound, Right Track, The Enchanted Cottage, The Ranch, and World Famous Orbit Sound. It was co-produced by dance-music artist [[Junior Vasquez]] and is highly typical of his work of the time; as such, many of the songs are held together by synthetic loops and percussion. Lyrics address issues like [[abortion]] (\"[[Sally's Pigeons]]\"), [[racism]] (\"A Part Hate\"), [[spousal abuse]] (\"Product of Misery\" and \"Broken Glass\") and [[incest]] (\"Lies\"). The track \"Product of Misery\" was inspired by a teacher of Lauper's, Bob Barrell, who described the masses of struggling people as a 'product of misery' and that misery begets misery unless the chain is broken.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Cyndi Lauper: A Memoir|last=Lauper|first=Cyndi|last2=Dunn|first2=Jancee|publisher=Simon & Schuster|year=2012|isbn=978-1-4711-1424-3|location=Great Britain|pages=39|quote=|via=}}</ref> The song \"A Part Hate\" was conceived as an anti-[[apartheid]] song and was originally written for Lauper's second album ''[[True Colors (Cyndi Lauper album)|True Colors]]'' but was not included because her label felt it would make the album too political; it already had a cover of [[Marvin Gaye]]'s \"[[What's Going On (song)|What's Going On]]\" and the [[True Colors (Cyndi Lauper song)|title track]] included.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Cyndi Lauper: A Memoir|last=Lauper|first=Cyndi|last2=Dunn|first2=Jancee|publisher=Simon & Schuster|year=2012|isbn=978-1-4711-1424-3|location=Great Britain|pages=166|quote=|via=}}</ref>\n\nThe album cover was inspired by a photograph of the actress [[Mary Pickford]], taken by photographer Nelson Evans.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-kdAq9xYhM4I/Tqkul4yO2gI/AAAAAAAAD3M/R5ZlKcyx8bQ/s1600/1917_nelsonevans_marypickford.jpg|title=Picture of Mary Pickford,taken by Nelson Evans|accessdate=June 5, 2013|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130628184717/http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-kdAq9xYhM4I/Tqkul4yO2gI/AAAAAAAAD3M/R5ZlKcyx8bQ/s1600/1917_nelsonevans_marypickford.jpg|archivedate=28 June 2013|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nLauper has commented that she wishes that her vocals on the project had been sharper. She worked with a vocal coach to sharpen her vocals for her next studio album ''[[Sisters of Avalon]]'', and mentions this in the liner notes.\n\n==Commercial performance==\nThe album had limited success due to lack of promotion on the part of Cyndi's label. It was considered a commercial disappointment in the [[United States]] and despite some positive critical reviews it stalled at No. 112 on the ''Billboard'' 200 albums chart. As of 2003, the album has sold 119,000 copies in the US, according to [[Nielsen SoundScan]].\n\nThe album fared better overseas, becoming most successful in Japan and France, achieving a Gold certification in both countries.
