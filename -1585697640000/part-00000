headaches that are not accompanied by an aura.\n* ''Migraine with aura'', or \"classic migraine\", usually involves migraine headaches accompanied by an aura. Less commonly, an aura can occur without a headache, or with a nonmigraine headache. Two other varieties are [[familial hemiplegic migraine]] and [[sporadic hemiplegic migraine]], in which a person has migraines with aura and with accompanying motor weakness. If a close relative has had the same condition, it is called \"familial\", otherwise it is called \"sporadic\". Another variety is basilar-type migraine, where a headache and aura are accompanied by [[dysarthria|difficulty speaking]], [[Vertigo (medical)|world spinning]], [[tinnitus|ringing in ears]], or a number of other brainstem-related symptoms, but not motor weakness. This type was initially believed to be due to spasms of the [[basilar artery]], the artery that supplies the brainstem. Now that this mechanism is not believed to be primary, the symptomatic term [[ICHD classification and diagnosis of migraine#Migraine with brainstem aura|migraine with brainstem aura (MBA)]] is preferred.<ref name=Basil2009/>\n* Childhood periodic syndromes that are commonly precursors of migraine include [[cyclical vomiting syndrome|cyclical vomiting]] (occasional intense periods of vomiting), [[abdominal migraine]] (abdominal pain, usually accompanied by nausea), and benign paroxysmal vertigo of childhood (occasional attacks of vertigo).\n* [[Retinal migraine]] involves migraine headaches accompanied by visual disturbances or even temporary blindness in one eye.\n* ''Complications of migraine'' describe migraine headaches and/or auras that are unusually long or unusually frequent, or associated with a seizure or brain lesion.\n* ''Probable migraine'' describes conditions that have some characteristics of migraines, but where there is not enough evidence to diagnose it as a migraine with certainty (in the presence of concurrent medication overuse).\n* ''Chronic migraine'' is a complication of migraines, and is a headache that fulfills diagnostic criteria for ''migraine headache'' and occurs for a greater time interval.  Specifically, greater or equal to 15 days/month for longer than 3 months.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Negro A, Rocchietti-March M, Fiorillo M, Martelletti P | title = Chronic migraine: current concepts and ongoing treatments | journal = European Review for Medical and Pharmacological Sciences | volume = 15 | issue = 12 | pages = 1401\u201320 | date = December 2011 | pmid = 22288302 }}</ref>\n\n===Abdominal migraine===\nThe diagnosis of [[abdominal migraine]]s is controversial.<ref name=Abdo2002>{{cite book|last=Davidoff|first=Robert A.| name-list-format = vanc |title=Migraine : manifestations, pathogenesis, and management|year=2002|publisher=Oxford Univ.

headaches that are not accompanied by an aura.\n* ''Migraine with aura'', or \"classic migraine\", usually involves migraine headaches accompanied by an aura. Less commonly, an aura can occur without a headache, or with a nonmigraine headache. Two other varieties are [[familial hemiplegic migraine]] and [[sporadic hemiplegic migraine]], in which a person has migraines with aura and with accompanying motor weakness. If a close relative has had the same condition, it is called \"familial\", otherwise it is called \"sporadic\". Another variety is basilar-type migraine, where a headache and aura are accompanied by [[dysarthria|difficulty speaking]], [[Vertigo (medical)|world spinning]], [[tinnitus|ringing in ears]], or a number of other brainstem-related symptoms, but not motor weakness. This type was initially believed to be due to spasms of the [[basilar artery]], the artery that supplies the brainstem. Now that this mechanism is not believed to be primary, the symptomatic term [[ICHD classification and diagnosis of migraine#Migraine with brainstem aura|migraine with brainstem aura (MBA)]] is preferred.<ref name=Basil2009/>\n* Childhood periodic syndromes that are commonly precursors of migraine include [[cyclical vomiting syndrome|cyclical vomiting]] (occasional intense periods of vomiting), [[abdominal migraine]] (abdominal pain, usually accompanied by nausea), and benign paroxysmal vertigo of childhood (occasional attacks of vertigo).\n* [[Retinal migraine]] involves migraine headaches accompanied by visual disturbances or even temporary blindness in one eye.\n* ''Complications of migraine'' describe migraine headaches and/or auras that are unusually long or unusually frequent, or associated with a seizure or brain lesion.\n* ''Probable migraine'' describes conditions that have some characteristics of migraines, but where there is not enough evidence to diagnose it as a migraine with certainty (in the presence of concurrent medication overuse).\n* ''Chronic migraine'' is a complication of migraines, and is a headache that fulfills diagnostic criteria for ''migraine headache'' and occurs for a greater time interval.  Specifically, greater or equal to 15 days/month for longer than 3 months.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Negro A, Rocchietti-March M, Fiorillo M, Martelletti P | title = Chronic migraine: current concepts and ongoing treatments | journal = European Review for Medical and Pharmacological Sciences | volume = 15 | issue = 12 | pages = 1401\u201320 | date = December 2011 | pmid = 22288302 }}</ref>\n\n===Abdominal migraine===\nThe diagnosis of [[abdominal migraine]]s is controversial.<ref name=Abdo2002>{{cite book|last=Davidoff|first=Robert A.| name-list-format = vanc |title=Migraine : manifestations, pathogenesis, and management|year=2002|publisher=Oxford Univ.

The key diagnostic test (detection of specific auto-antibodies in cerebrospinal fluid) is not routinely offered by most immunology laboratories. Some of the rarer auto-antibodies (e.g., NMDAR) have no commercially available assay and can only be measured by a very small number of research laboratories worldwide, further delaying diagnosis by weeks or months. Most patients with limbic encephalitis are initially diagnosed with [[herpes simplex encephalitis]], because the two syndromes cannot be distinguished clinically.<ref name=\"Tuzun2007\"/> [[HHV-6]] (human herpes virus 6) encephalitis is also clinically indistinguishable from limbic encephalitis.<ref name=\"Tuzun2007\"/>\n\nThere are two sets of diagnostic criteria used.

Best known for his orchestral suite ''[[The Planets]]'', he composed many other works across a range of genres, although none achieved comparable success. His distinctive compositional style was the product of many influences, [[Richard Wagner]] and [[Richard Strauss]] being most crucial early in his development. The subsequent inspiration of the [[English folk music#Folk revivals 1890\u20131969|English folksong revival]] of the early 20th century, and the example of such rising modern composers as [[Maurice Ravel]], led Holst to develop and refine an individual style.\n\nThere were professional musicians in the previous three generations of Holst's family and it was clear from his early years that he would follow the same calling. He hoped to become a pianist but was prevented by [[neuritis]] in his right arm. Despite his father's reservations, he pursued a career as a composer, studying at the [[Royal College of Music]] under [[Charles Villiers Stanford]]. Unable to support himself by his compositions, he played the [[trombone]] professionally and later became a teacher\u2014a great one, according to his colleague [[Ralph Vaughan Williams]]. Among other teaching activities, he built up a strong tradition of performance at [[Morley College]], where he served as musical director from 1907 until 1924 and pioneered music education for women at [[St Paul's Girls' School]], where he taught from 1905 until his death in 1934. He was the founder of a series of [[Whitsun]] music festivals, which ran from 1916 for the remainder of his life.\n\nHolst's works were played frequently in the early years of the 20th century, but it was not until the international success of ''The Planets'' in the years immediately after the First World War that he became a well-known figure. A shy man, he did not welcome this fame and preferred to be left in peace to compose and teach. In his later years, his uncompromising, personal style of composition struck many music lovers as too austere, and his brief popularity declined. Nevertheless, he was a considerable influence on a number of younger English composers, including [[Edmund Rubbra]], [[Michael Tippett]] and [[Benjamin Britten]]. Apart from ''The Planets'' and a handful of other works, his music was generally neglected until the 1980s, when recordings of much of his output became available.\n\n==Life and career==\n===Early years===\n====Family background====\n[[File:Holst-family-tree.tif|thumb|upright=1.4|right|alt=family tree diagram showing Gustav in relation to three earlier generations|Holst family tree (simplified)]]\nHolst was born in [[Cheltenham]], [[Gloucestershire]], the elder of the two children of Adolph von Holst, a professional musician, and his wife, Clara Cox, ''n\u00e9e'' Lediard.

Rubbra recalled that he would divine a student's difficulties and gently guide him to finding the solution for himself. \"I do not recall that Holst added one single note of his own to anything I wrote, but he would suggest\u2014if I agreed!\u2014that, given such and such a phrase, the following one would be better if it took such and such a course; if I did not see this, the point would not be insisted upon&nbsp;...

Matthews considers the evocation of a North African town in the ''[[Beni Mora]]'' suite of 1908 the composer's most individual work to that date; the third movement gives a preview of [[Minimal music|minimalism]] in its constant repetition of a four-bar theme. Holst wrote two suites for military band, in [[First Suite in E-flat for Military Band|E flat (1909)]] and [[Second Suite in F for Military Band|F major (1911)]] respectively, the first of which became and remains a brass-band staple.<ref name=grove/> This piece, a highly original and substantial musical work, was a signal departure from what Short describes as \"the usual transcriptions and operatic selections which pervaded the band repertoire\".<ref>Short, p. 82</ref> Also in 1911 he wrote ''Hecuba's Lament'', a setting of [[Gilbert Murray]]'s translation from [[Euripides]] built on a seven-beat refrain designed, says Dickinson, to represent [[Hecuba]]'s defiance of divine wrath.<ref>Dickinson (1995), p. 22</ref> In 1912 Holst composed two psalm settings, in which he experimented with [[plainsong]];<ref name=H662>Holst (1980), p. 662</ref> the same year saw the enduringly popular ''St Paul's Suite'' (a \"gay but retrogressive\" piece according to Dickinson),<ref>Dickinson (1995), p. 167</ref> and the failure of his large scale orchestral work ''Phantastes''.<ref name=grove/>\n\n===Full flowering===\n====''The Planets''====\n[[File:Holst-Planets-Saturn-score.jpg|thumb|The opening of \"Saturn\", the fifth movement of ''The Planets'']]\nHolst conceived the idea of ''[[The Planets]]'' in 1913, partly as a result of his interest in astrology,{{refn|Holst was reading [[Alan Leo]]'s booklet ''What is a Horoscope?'' at the time.<ref>Short, p. 122</ref>|group=n}} and also from his determination, despite the failure of ''Phantastes'', to produce a large-scale orchestral work.<ref name=dnb/> The chosen format may have been influenced by Schoenberg's [[Five Pieces for Orchestra|''F\u00fcnf Orchesterst\u00fccke'']], and shares something of the aesthetic, Matthews suggests, of [[Claude Debussy|Debussy]]'s ''[[Nocturnes (Debussy)|Nocturnes]]'' or ''[[La mer (Debussy)|La mer]]''.<ref name=grove/><ref>Dickinson (1995), p. 169</ref> Holst began composing ''The Planets'' in 1914;

The ''Brook Green Suite'' (1932), written for the orchestra of St Paul's School, was a late companion piece to the ''St Paul's Suite''.<ref name=H663/> The ''Lyric Movement'' for viola and small orchestra (1933) was written for [[Lionel Tertis]]. Quiet and contemplative, and requiring little virtuosity from the soloist, the piece was slow to gain popularity among violists.<ref>Short, pp. 324\u2013325</ref> Robin Hull, in ''Penguin Music Magazine'', praised the work's \"clear beauty\u2014impossible to mistake for the art of any other composer\"; in Dickinson's view, however, it remains \"a frail creation\".<ref>Dickinson (1995), p. 154</ref> Holst's final composition, the orchestral scherzo movement of a projected symphony, contains features characteristic of much of Holst's earlier music\u2014\"a summing up of Holst's orchestral art\", according to Short.<ref>Short, pp. 319\u2013320</ref> Dickinson suggests that the somewhat casual collection of material in the work gives little indication of the symphony that might have been written.<ref>Dickinson (1995), p. 157</ref>\n\n==Recordings==\nHolst made some recordings, conducting his own music. For the [[Columbia Graphophone Company|Columbia]] company he recorded ''Beni Mora'', the ''Marching Song'' and the complete ''Planets'' with the [[London Symphony Orchestra]] (LSO) in 1922, using the [[Recording studio#1890s to 1930s|acoustic process]]. The limitations of early recording prevented the gradual fade-out of women's voices at the end of \"Neptune\", and the lower strings had to be replaced by a tuba to obtain an effective bass sound.<ref>Short, p. 205</ref> With an anonymous string orchestra Holst recorded the ''St Paul's Suite'' and ''Country Song'' in 1925.<ref>{{cite news|title= Columbia Records|newspaper=The Times|date=5 November 1925|page=10}}</ref> Columbia's main rival, [[the Gramophone Company|HMV]], issued recordings of some of the same repertoire, with an unnamed orchestra conducted by [[Albert Coates (musician)|Albert Coates]].<ref>{{cite news|title= Gramophone Notes |newspaper=The Times|date=9 June 1928|page=12}}</ref> When electrical recording came in, with dramatically improved recording quality, Holst and the LSO re-recorded ''The Planets'' for Columbia in 1926.<ref>Short, p. 247</ref>\n\nIn the early [[Long playing record|LP]] era little of Holst's music was available on disc.

By the early years of the 21st century most of the major and many of the minor orchestral and choral works had been issued on disc. The 2008 issue of ''[[The Penguin Guide to Recorded Classical Music]]'' contained seven pages of listings of Holst's works on CD.<ref>March, pp. 617\u2013623</ref> Of the operas, ''Savitri'', ''The Wandering Scholar'', and ''At the Boar's Head'' have been recorded.<ref>[http://www.worldcat.org/title/savitri-an-episode-from-the-mahabharata/oclc/18508869&referer=brief_results \"Savitri\"]; and [http://www.worldcat.org/title/wandering-scholar-at-the-boars-head/oclc/39784315&referer=brief_results \"Wandering scholar / At the Boar's Head\"], WorldCat, accessed 24 March 2013</ref>\n\n==Legacy==\n{{Quote box|width=246px|bgcolor=#c6dbf7|align=left|quote= \"[Holst's] influence is lasting in the work of all of us who value directness and sincerity and who view music not so much a secret preserve for the leisured few as a vital part of everyday life\"\n|salign = left |source= ''A tribute from [[Edmund Rubbra]]''<ref>From \"GH: An account of Holst's attitude to the teaching of composition, by one of his pupils\", first published in ''Crescendo'', February 1949.

In it he found \"a new concept not only of how melody might be organized, but of what the implications were for the development of a mature artistic language\".<ref name=dnb/> Holst did not found or lead a school of composition; nevertheless, he exercised influences over both contemporaries and successors. According to Short, Vaughan Williams described Holst as \"the greatest influence on my music\",<ref name=Short336>Short, pp. 336\u201338</ref> although Matthews asserts that each influenced the other equally.<ref name=grove/> Among later composers, [[Michael Tippett]] is acknowledged by Short as Holst's \"most significant artistic successor\", both in terms of compositional style and because Tippett, who succeeded Holst as director of music at Morley College, maintained the spirit of Holst's music there.<ref name=Short336/> Of an early encounter with Holst, Tippett later wrote: \"Holst seemed to look right inside me, with an acute spiritual vision\".<ref>Tippett, p. 15</ref> Kennedy observes that \"a new generation of listeners&nbsp;... recognized in Holst the fount of much that they admired in the music of Britten and Tippett\".<ref name=\"OCM\"/> Holst's pupil Edmund Rubbra acknowledged how he and other younger English composers had adopted Holst's economy of style: \"With what enthusiasm did we pare down our music to the very bone\".<ref name=H664/>\n\nShort cites other English composers who are in debt to Holst, in particular William Walton and [[Benjamin Britten]], and suggests that Holst's influence may have been felt further afield.{{refn|Short observes that the rising fourths of \"Jupiter\" can be heard in [[Aaron Copland|Copland]]'s ''Appalachian Spring'', and suggests that the ''Hymn of Jesus'' might be considered as a forerunner of [[Igor Stravinsky|Stravinsky]]'s ''[[Symphony of Psalms]]'' \"and the hieratic serial cantatas\", though admitting that \"it is doubtful whether Stravinsky was familiar with, or even aware of this work\".<ref>Short, p. 337</ref> |group=n}} Above all, Short recognises Holst as a composer for the people, who believed it was a composer's duty to provide music for practical purposes\u2014festivals, celebrations, ceremonies, Christmas carols or simple hymn tunes. Thus, says Short, \"many people who may never have heard any of [Holst's] major works&nbsp;... have nevertheless derived great pleasure from hearing or singing such small masterpieces as the carol '[[In the Bleak Midwinter]]'\".<ref>Short, p. 339</ref>\n\nOn 27 September 2009, after a weekend of concerts at Chichester Cathedral in memory of Holst, a new memorial was unveiled to mark the 75th anniversary of the composer's death.

Best known for his orchestral suite ''[[The Planets]]'', he composed many other works across a range of genres, although none achieved comparable success. His distinctive compositional style was the product of many influences, [[Richard Wagner]] and [[Richard Strauss]] being most crucial early in his development. The subsequent inspiration of the [[English folk music#Folk revivals 1890\u20131969|English folksong revival]] of the early 20th century, and the example of such rising modern composers as [[Maurice Ravel]], led Holst to develop and refine an individual style.\n\nThere were professional musicians in the previous three generations of Holst's family and it was clear from his early years that he would follow the same calling. He hoped to become a pianist but was prevented by [[neuritis]] in his right arm. Despite his father's reservations, he pursued a career as a composer, studying at the [[Royal College of Music]] under [[Charles Villiers Stanford]]. Unable to support himself by his compositions, he played the [[trombone]] professionally and later became a teacher\u2014a great one, according to his colleague [[Ralph Vaughan Williams]]. Among other teaching activities, he built up a strong tradition of performance at [[Morley College]], where he served as musical director from 1907 until 1924 and pioneered music education for women at [[St Paul's Girls' School]], where he taught from 1905 until his death in 1934. He was the founder of a series of [[Whitsun]] music festivals, which ran from 1916 for the remainder of his life.\n\nHolst's works were played frequently in the early years of the 20th century, but it was not until the international success of ''The Planets'' in the years immediately after the First World War that he became a well-known figure. A shy man, he did not welcome this fame and preferred to be left in peace to compose and teach. In his later years, his uncompromising, personal style of composition struck many music lovers as too austere, and his brief popularity declined. Nevertheless, he was a considerable influence on a number of younger English composers, including [[Edmund Rubbra]], [[Michael Tippett]] and [[Benjamin Britten]]. Apart from ''The Planets'' and a handful of other works, his music was generally neglected until the 1980s, when recordings of much of his output became available.\n\n==Life and career==\n===Early years===\n====Family background====\n[[File:Holst-family-tree.tif|thumb|upright=1.4|right|alt=family tree diagram showing Gustav in relation to three earlier generations|Holst family tree (simplified)]]\nHolst was born in [[Cheltenham]], [[Gloucestershire]], the elder of the two children of Adolph von Holst, a professional musician, and his wife, Clara Cox, ''n\u00e9e'' Lediard.

He persevered, and gradually built up a class of dedicated music-lovers.<ref>Holst (1969), p. 30</ref>\n\nAccording to the composer [[Edmund Rubbra]], who studied under him in the early 1920s, Holst was \"a teacher who often came to lessons weighted, not with the learning of [[Ebenezer Prout|Prout]] and [[John Stainer|Stainer]], but with a miniature score of ''[[Petrushka]]'' or the then recently published [[Mass in G minor (Vaughan Williams)|Mass in G minor]] of Vaughan Williams\".<ref>Rubbra, p. 40</ref> He never sought to impose his own ideas on his composition pupils. Rubbra recalled that he would divine a student's difficulties and gently guide him to finding the solution for himself. \"I do not recall that Holst added one single note of his own to anything I wrote, but he would suggest\u2014if I agreed!\u2014that, given such and such a phrase, the following one would be better if it took such and such a course; if I did not see this, the point would not be insisted upon&nbsp;...

Matthews summarises the music as \"elusive and unpredictable [with] three main elements: a pulseless wandering melody [for strings], a sad brass processional, and restless music for strings and oboe.\" The mysterious dance towards the end is, says Matthews, \"the strangest moment in a strange work\".<ref name=grove/> Richard Greene in ''[[Music & Letters]]'' describes the piece as \"a [[Tempo|larghetto]] dance in a [[Siciliana|siciliano]] rhythm with a simple, stepwise, rocking melody\", but lacking the power of ''The Planets'' and, at times, monotonous to the listener.<ref>{{cite journal|last= Greene|first=Richard|title=A Musico-Rhetorical Outline of Holst's 'Egdon Heath'|jstor=735933|journal=[[Music & Letters]]|volume= 73|issue=2|date=May 1992|pages=244\u201367|doi=10.1093/ml/73.2.244}} {{subscription}}</ref> A more popular success was ''[[A Moorside Suite]]'' for brass band, written as a test piece for the National Brass Band Festival championships of 1928. While written within the traditions of north-country brass-band music, the suite, Short says, bears Holst's unmistakable imprint, \"from the skipping [[Time signature#Most frequent time signatures|6/8]] of the opening Scherzo, to the vigorous melodic fourths of the concluding March, the intervening Nocturne bearing a family resemblance to the slow-moving procession of ''Saturn''\".<ref>Short, p. 263</ref> 'A Moorside Suite' has undergone major revisionism in the article 'Symphony Within: rehearing Holst's 'A Moorside Suite' by Stephen Arthur Allen in the Winter 2017 edition of 'The Musical Times'.<ref>Stephen Arthur Allen, 'Symphony within: rehearing Holst's \"A Moorside Suite\"', The Musical Times (Winter, 2017), pp.7\u201332</ref> As with 'Egdon Heath' \u2013 commissioned as a symphony \u2013 the article reveals the symphonic nature of this brass-band work.\n\nAfter this, Holst tackled his final attempt at opera in a cheerful vein, with ''The Wandering Scholar'' (1929\u201330), to a text by Clifford Bax. Imogen refers to the music as \"Holst at his best in a scherzando (playful) frame of mind\";<ref name=H664/> Vaughan Williams commented on the lively, folksy rhythms: \"Do you think there's a ''little'' bit too much 6/8 in the opera?\"<ref>Quoted in Short, p. 351</ref> Short observes that the opening motif makes several reappearances without being identified with a particular character, but imposes musical unity on the work.<ref>Short, p. 420</ref>\n\nHolst composed few large-scale works in his final years. ''A Choral Fantasia'' of 1930 was written for the [[Three Choirs Festival]] at [[Gloucester]]; beginning and ending with a soprano soloist, the work, also involving chorus, strings, brass and percussion, includes a substantial organ solo which, says Imogen Holst, \"knows something of the 'colossal and mysterious' loneliness of ''Egdon Heath''\".<ref>Holst (1986), pp. 100\u2013101</ref> Apart from his final uncompleted symphony, Holst's remaining works were for small forces; the eight ''Canons'' of 1932 were dedicated to his pupils, though in Imogen's view that they present a formidable challenge to the most professional of singers. The ''Brook Green Suite'' (1932), written for the orchestra of St Paul's School, was a late companion piece to the ''St Paul's Suite''.<ref name=H663/> The ''Lyric Movement'' for viola and small orchestra (1933) was written for [[Lionel Tertis]]. Quiet and contemplative, and requiring little virtuosity from the soloist, the piece was slow to gain popularity among violists.<ref>Short, pp. 324\u2013325</ref> Robin Hull, in ''Penguin Music Magazine'', praised the work's \"clear beauty\u2014impossible to mistake for the art of any other composer\"; in Dickinson's view, however, it remains \"a frail creation\".<ref>Dickinson (1995), p. 154</ref> Holst's final composition, the orchestral scherzo movement of a projected symphony, contains features characteristic of much of Holst's earlier music\u2014\"a summing up of Holst's orchestral art\", according to Short.<ref>Short, pp. 319\u2013320</ref> Dickinson suggests that the somewhat casual collection of material in the work gives little indication of the symphony that might have been written.<ref>Dickinson (1995), p. 157</ref>\n\n==Recordings==\nHolst made some recordings, conducting his own music. For the [[Columbia Graphophone Company|Columbia]] company he recorded ''Beni Mora'', the ''Marching Song'' and the complete ''Planets'' with the [[London Symphony Orchestra]] (LSO) in 1922, using the [[Recording studio#1890s to 1930s|acoustic process]]. The limitations of early recording prevented the gradual fade-out of women's voices at the end of \"Neptune\", and the lower strings had to be replaced by a tuba to obtain an effective bass sound.<ref>Short, p. 205</ref> With an anonymous string orchestra Holst recorded the ''St Paul's Suite'' and ''Country Song'' in 1925.<ref>{{cite news|title= Columbia Records|newspaper=The Times|date=5 November 1925|page=10}}</ref> Columbia's main rival, [[the Gramophone Company|HMV]], issued recordings of some of the same repertoire, with an unnamed orchestra conducted by [[Albert Coates (musician)|Albert Coates]].<ref>{{cite news|title= Gramophone Notes |newspaper=The Times|date=9 June 1928|page=12}}</ref> When electrical recording came in, with dramatically improved recording quality, Holst and the LSO re-recorded ''The Planets'' for Columbia in 1926.<ref>Short, p. 247</ref>\n\nIn the early [[Long playing record|LP]] era little of Holst's music was available on disc.

By the early years of the 21st century most of the major and many of the minor orchestral and choral works had been issued on disc. The 2008 issue of ''[[The Penguin Guide to Recorded Classical Music]]'' contained seven pages of listings of Holst's works on CD.<ref>March, pp. 617\u2013623</ref> Of the operas, ''Savitri'', ''The Wandering Scholar'', and ''At the Boar's Head'' have been recorded.<ref>[http://www.worldcat.org/title/savitri-an-episode-from-the-mahabharata/oclc/18508869&referer=brief_results \"Savitri\"]; and [http://www.worldcat.org/title/wandering-scholar-at-the-boars-head/oclc/39784315&referer=brief_results \"Wandering scholar / At the Boar's Head\"], WorldCat, accessed 24 March 2013</ref>\n\n==Legacy==\n{{Quote box|width=246px|bgcolor=#c6dbf7|align=left|quote= \"[Holst's] influence is lasting in the work of all of us who value directness and sincerity and who view music not so much a secret preserve for the leisured few as a vital part of everyday life\"\n|salign = left |source= ''A tribute from [[Edmund Rubbra]]''<ref>From \"GH: An account of Holst's attitude to the teaching of composition, by one of his pupils\", first published in ''Crescendo'', February 1949.

In it he found \"a new concept not only of how melody might be organized, but of what the implications were for the development of a mature artistic language\".<ref name=dnb/> Holst did not found or lead a school of composition; nevertheless, he exercised influences over both contemporaries and successors. According to Short, Vaughan Williams described Holst as \"the greatest influence on my music\",<ref name=Short336>Short, pp. 336\u201338</ref> although Matthews asserts that each influenced the other equally.<ref name=grove/> Among later composers, [[Michael Tippett]] is acknowledged by Short as Holst's \"most significant artistic successor\", both in terms of compositional style and because Tippett, who succeeded Holst as director of music at Morley College, maintained the spirit of Holst's music there.<ref name=Short336/> Of an early encounter with Holst, Tippett later wrote: \"Holst seemed to look right inside me, with an acute spiritual vision\".<ref>Tippett, p. 15</ref> Kennedy observes that \"a new generation of listeners&nbsp;... recognized in Holst the fount of much that they admired in the music of Britten and Tippett\".<ref name=\"OCM\"/> Holst's pupil Edmund Rubbra acknowledged how he and other younger English composers had adopted Holst's economy of style: \"With what enthusiasm did we pare down our music to the very bone\".<ref name=H664/>\n\nShort cites other English composers who are in debt to Holst, in particular William Walton and [[Benjamin Britten]], and suggests that Holst's influence may have been felt further afield.{{refn|Short observes that the rising fourths of \"Jupiter\" can be heard in [[Aaron Copland|Copland]]'s ''Appalachian Spring'', and suggests that the ''Hymn of Jesus'' might be considered as a forerunner of [[Igor Stravinsky|Stravinsky]]'s ''[[Symphony of Psalms]]'' \"and the hieratic serial cantatas\", though admitting that \"it is doubtful whether Stravinsky was familiar with, or even aware of this work\".<ref>Short, p. 337</ref> |group=n}} Above all, Short recognises Holst as a composer for the people, who believed it was a composer's duty to provide music for practical purposes\u2014festivals, celebrations, ceremonies, Christmas carols or simple hymn tunes. Thus, says Short, \"many people who may never have heard any of [Holst's] major works&nbsp;... have nevertheless derived great pleasure from hearing or singing such small masterpieces as the carol '[[In the Bleak Midwinter]]'\".<ref>Short, p. 339</ref>\n\nOn 27 September 2009, after a weekend of concerts at Chichester Cathedral in memory of Holst, a new memorial was unveiled to mark the 75th anniversary of the composer's death.

{"title_page": "History of the United States Coast Guard", "text_new": "{{Use American English|date=October 2014}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=February 2013}}\nThe '''history of the [[United States Coast Guard]]''' goes back to the [[United States Revenue Cutter Service]], which was founded on 4 August 1790 as part of the [[United States Department of the Treasury|Department of the Treasury]].  The Revenue Cutter Service and the [[United States Life-Saving Service]] were merged to become the Coast Guard per {{USC|14|1}} which states: \"The Coast Guard as established January 28, 1915, shall be a military service and a branch of the armed forces of the United States at all times.\"  In 1939, the [[United States Lighthouse Service]] was merged into the Coast Guard.  The Coast Guard itself was moved to the [[United States Department of Transportation|Department of Transportation]] in 1967, and on 25 February 2003 it became part of the [[United States Department of Homeland Security|Department of Homeland Security]]. However, under {{USC|14|3}} as amended by section 211 of the Coast Guard and Maritime Transportation Act of 2006, upon the declaration of war and when [[United States Congress|Congress]] so directs in the declaration, or when the [[President of the United States|President]] directs, the Coast Guard operates as a service in the [[United States Department of the Navy|Department of the Navy]].\n\n==Early history==\n===The Revenue-Marine===\nThe modern Coast Guard was created in 1915 by the merger of the [[United States Revenue Cutter Service]] and the [[United States Lifesaving Service]], but its roots go back to the early days of the Republic. [[Secretary of the Treasury]] [[Alexander Hamilton]] lobbied Congress to authorize a [[First ten Revenue Service cutters|\"system of cutters\"]] to enforce tariffs, which was major source of revenue for the new nation. On 4 August 1790 (now recognized as the Coast Guard's official birthday), Congress passed the Tariff Act, permitting the construction of ten cutters and the recruitment of 40 revenue officers. Each cutter was assigned one master and three mates who were commissioned officers. In addition, each cutter was allowed four mariners and two boys. <ref name=Evans5>Evans, p.5</ref> The cutters were collectively referred to as the \"Revenue-Marine,\" and later officially organized as the \"Revenue Cutter Service.\" Initially, the  was not an organized service. Each revenue cutter operated independently, with each assigned to patrol a section of the east coast and reporting directly to the [[Customs House]] in a major port. From 1790, when the [[Continental Navy]] was disbanded, to 1798, when the [[United States Navy]] was created, these \"revenue cutters\" were the country's only naval force.<ref name=Evans14>Evans, p. 14</ref> As such, the cutters and their crews took on a wide variety of duties beyond the enforcement of tariffs, including combating piracy, rescuing mariners in distress, ferrying government officials, and even carrying mail. In 1794, the Revenue-Marine was given the mission of preventing trading in slaves from Africa to the United States. Between 1794 and 1865, the Service captured approximately 500 slave ships. In 1808, the Service was responsible for enforcing President [[Thomas Jefferson]]'s embargo closing U.S. ports to European trade. The 1822 Timber Act tasked the Revenue Cutter Service with protecting government timber from poachers (this is viewed as the beginning of the Coast Guard's environmental protection mission).<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.uscg.mil/hq/g-cp/comrel/factfile/Factcards/Resources.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=31 July 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060720081519/http://www.uscg.mil/hq/g-cp/comrel/factfile/Factcards/Resources.html |archive-date=20 July 2006 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref> During times of war or crisis, the revenue cutters and their crews were put at the disposal of the Navy. The Revenue-Marine involved in the [[Quasi-War]] with France from 1798 to 1799, the [[War of 1812]], and the [[Mexican\u2013American War]].\n\n===United States Revenue Cutter Service===\n[[File:Seal of the United States Revenue Cutter Service.png|thumb|Seal of the United States Revenue Cutter Service]] \nDuring the [[American Civil War]], USRC ''[[USS Harriet Lane (1857)|Harriet Lane]]'' fired the first naval shots of the war, engaging the steamer ''Nashville'' during the siege of [[Fort Sumter]].<ref name=Evans75>Evans, p. 75</ref> Upon the order of President Lincoln to the Secretary of the Treasury on 14 June 1863, cutters were assigned to the [[North Atlantic Blockading Squadron]]. A [[Confederate Revenue-Marine]] was also formed by crewmen who left the Revenue Cutter Service.\n\nAfter the purchase of Alaska in 1867, {{USRC|Lincoln}}, with First Lieutenant George W. Moore aboard was dispatched to [[Sitka, Alaska|Sitka]] to establish United States sovereignty as agent of the U.S. Collector of Customs in San Francisco.

Congress awarded the three men [[Congressional Gold Medal]]s for \"heroic service rendered\" on 28 June 1902.<ref name=Evans134-139>Evans, pp. 134\u2013139</ref> During the [[Snake River gold rush]] of 1900, the Revenue Cutter Service returned destitute miners to Seattle from Alaska.\n\n===United States Lifesaving Service===\n[[File:Seal of the United States Life-Saving Service.png|thumb|Seal of the United States Life-Saving Service]]\nA number of voluntary organizations had formed in coastal communities in the 1700s and early 1800s to assist shipwrecked mariners by means of small boats at shore-based stations, notably the [[Massachusetts Humane Society]] (est. 1758). These stations were normally unoccupied \u2013 essentially storehouses for boats and equipment to be used by volunteers. With the signing of the Newell Act on August 14, 1848, Congress appropriated $10,000 to fund lifesaving stations along the east coast. These were loosely administered by the Revenue-Marine, but still dependent on volunteers (like many fire departments of the time).\n\nThis system continued until 1871 when [[Sumner Kimball]] was appointed Chief of the Revenue Marine Division of the Treasury Department. Kimball convinced Congress to appropriate $200,000 to construct new stations, repair old ones, and provide full-time crews. Shortly thereafter, in 1878, the U.S. Lifesaving Service was officially born and so-named.\n\nAlthough the Revenue Cutter Service is perhaps more recognized as ''the'' predecessor of the Coast Guard, the Lifesaving Service's legacy is apparent in many ways, not the least of which is the prominence of the Coast Guard's search and rescue mission in the eyes of the public. The Coast Guard takes its unofficial search and rescue motto, \"You have to go out, but you don't have to come back,\" from the 1899 regulations of the [[United States Life Saving Service]], which stated:\n\n<blockquote>In attempting a rescue the keeper will select either the boat, breeches buoy, or life car, as in his judgment is best suited to effectively cope with the existing conditions. If the device first selected fails after such trial as satisfies him that no further attempt with it is feasible, he will resort to one of the others, and if that fails, then to the remaining one, and he will not desist from his efforts until by actual trial the impossibility of effecting a rescue is demonstrated. The statement of the keeper that he did not try to use the boat because the sea or surf was too heavy will not be accepted unless attempts to launch it were actually made and failed [underlining added], or unless the conformation of the coast\u2014as bluffs, precipitous banks, etc.\u2014is such as to unquestionably preclude the use of a boat.</blockquote>\n\nThese regulations were repeated in the 1934 Coast Guard regulations.{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}}\n\nA number of Coast Guard traditions survive from, or pay homage to, the Lifesaving Service as well. For example, members of the Lifesaving Service were referred to as \"surfmen,\" and today the [[Surfman Badge]] it awarded to [[coxswains]] who qualify to operate motor lifeboats in heavy surf conditions. The badge's design is similar to the Lifesaving Service's seal.\n\n===Coast Guard Academy===\nThe School of Instruction of the Revenue Cutter Service was established in 1876, near New Bedford, Massachusetts. It used the [[USRC James C. Dobbin (1853)|USRC ''Dobbin'']] for its training exercises.  It moved to Curtis Bay, Maryland in 1900 and then again in 1910 to Fort Trumbull, near New London, Connecticut. The school provided a two-year premise to ship supplemented by some class work and tutoring in technical subjects.  In 1903, the third year of instruction was added.  The school was oriented to line officers, as engineers were hired directly from civilian life.  In 1906, an engineering program for cadets began. Nevertheless, the school remained small, with 5 to 10 cadets per class. In 1914 the School became the Revenue Cutter Academy and with the merger of the Revenue Cutter Service and the Life Saving Service in 1915, it became the [[United States Coast Guard Academy]]. In February 1929, Congress appropriated $1,750,000 for construction of buildings to be used for the academy. The city of New London purchased the land on the Thames River and donated it to the government for use as a Coast Guard facility. Construction began in 1931 and the first cadets began occupying the new facilities in 1932.<ref name=Johnson109>Johnson, p 109</ref>\n\n===Creation of the modern Coast Guard===\nOn 28 January 1915, the United States Revenue Cutter Service and the United States Lifesaving Service were merged by act of Congress to form the United States Coast Guard.<ref name=Johnson32>Johnson, p. 32</ref>  The [[United States Lighthouse Service]] was absorbed by the Coast Guard in 1939.

All cutters were to report to the nearest Naval District commander and stand by for further orders.<ref name=Larzelere(2003)7>Larzelere (2003), p. 7</ref> All normal operations were suspended with the exception of rescues pending orders from the Navy. [[Secretary of the Navy]] [[Josephus Daniels]] directed that although the Coast Guard was then a part of the Navy, that most of the administrative details handled by Coast Guard Headquarters would not be changed.  At the outset of the war the Coast Guard consisted of less than 4000 officers and men, had 23 cruising cutters, 21 harbor cutters, 272 rescue stations and 21 cadets at the Coast Guard Academy.<ref name=Larzelere(2003)11-16>Larzelere (2003), pp. 11\u201416</ref><ref name=Larzelere(2003)21>Larzelere (2003), p.21</ref> The Coast Guard was still in a formative stage of development from the merger of the U.S. Revenue Cutter Service and the U.S. Lifesaving Service.  Because of this fact, there was not much interaction between the two former entities during the war.  A qualified Lifesaving Service surfman who wished to transfer to a cutter had to be reduced to ordinary seaman upon reporting because of a lack of shipboard skills. Because of this transfers were infrequent.  There were no chief petty officers in the Coast Guard at this time and Coast Guard petty officers assigned to Navy ships often served under less experienced supervisors for less pay.<ref name=Larzelere(2003)19>Larzelere (2003), p. 19</ref>\n\n\nCoast Guard cutters were seen by the Navy as ready assets and were used to fill in for a rapidly expanding Navy.  The Navy recognized Coast Guard officers and petty officers as the experienced mariners that they were and often put them on Navy ships to fill in for crew shortages and lack of experience.\n\n=== Sinking of USCGC Tampa ===\nDuring the late afternoon of 26 September 1918, ''Tampa'' parted company with convoy HG-107, which she had just escorted into the [[Irish Sea]] from Gibraltar. Ordered to put into [[Milford Haven]], [[Wales]], she proceeded independently toward her destination.<ref name=Larzelere(2003)47>Larzelere (2003), p. 47</ref> At 1930 that evening, as she transited the [[Bristol Channel]], the warship was spotted by {{SMU|UB-91||2}}. According to the submarine war diary entry, the U-boat dived and maneuvered into an attack position, firing one torpedo out of the stern tube at 2015 from a range of about 550 meters. Minutes later, the torpedo hit ''Tampa'' and exploded portside amidships, throwing up a huge, luminous column of water.<ref name=Johnson55>Johnson, p 55</ref> The cutter sank with all hands: 111 Coast Guardsmen, 4 U.S. Navy sailors, and 16 passengers consisting of 11 [[Royal Navy]] sailors and 5 [[United States Maritime Service|Maritime Service Merchant Marines]].<ref name=Larzelere(2003)49>Larzelere (2003), p. 49</ref> The sinking of ''Tampa'' was the largest single loss of Coast Guard personnel in the war.<ref name=Larzelere(2003)50>Larzelere (2003), p. 50</ref> She sank in the [[Bristol Channel]] at roughly {{coord|50|40|N|6|19|W}}.<ref name=DANFS>''Tampa'', Dictionary of American Naval Fighting Ships, U.S. Navy Naval History & Heritage Command</ref>\n\n\nDuring the war, in 1918, twin sisters Genevieve and Lucille Baker of the Naval Coastal Defense Reserve became the first uniformed women to serve in the Coast Guard.<ref name=\"cbc.ca\">{{cite news| url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/background/military-international/ | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20130328085505/http://www.cbc.ca/news/background/military-international |archivedate=28 March 2013 |title=Women in the military \u2013 international |date=30 May 2006 |work=CBC News | url-status=dead}}</ref><ref name=WHC>\"Women's History Chronology\", Women & the U.

The effort was not entirely successful, due to the slowness of the destroyers.  However, the mission provided many Coast Guard officers and [[petty officer]]s with operational experience which proved invaluable in [[World War II]]. The Navy's epithet of \"Hooligan Navy\" dates from this era, due to the Coast Guard's flexibility in enlisting men discharged from other services to rapidly expand; it has endured due to the high proportion of prior-other-service enlisteds, and become a term of pride within the service.\n\n===1927 Mississippi River flood===\n\nDuring the disastrous [[Great Mississippi Flood of 1927|1927 Mississippi River flood]], the Coast Guard rescued a total of 43,853 persons who they \"removed from perilous positions to places of safety\".  Additionally, they saved 11,313 head of livestock and furnished transportation for 72 persons in need of hospitalization.  In all 674 Coast Guardsmen and 128 Coast Guard vessels and boats served in the relief operations.<ref name=Johnson99>Johnson, p 99</ref>\n\n==The 1930s==\n\n===Increasing regulation of merchant shipping===\nThe Steamboat Inspection Service was merged with the Bureau of Navigation, created in 1884, to oversee the regulation of merchant seamen, on 30 June 1932.\n\nIn 1934, the passenger vessel [[SS Morro Castle (1930)|SS ''Morro Castle'']] suffered a serious fire off the coast of New Jersey, which ultimately claimed the lives of 124 passenger and crew.  The casualty prompted new [[fire protection]] standards for vessels and paved the way for the \"Act of May 27, 1936\", which reorganized and changed the name of the Bureau of Navigation and Steamboat Inspection Service to the Bureau of Marine Inspection and Navigation.\n\nMarine inspection and navigation duties under the Bureau of Marine Inspection and Navigation were temporarily transferred to the Coast Guard by executive order on 28 February 1942. This transfer of duties fit well with the Coast Guard's port safety and security missions, and was made permanent in 1946.\n<ref>[https://www.piersystem.com/go/doc/786/166737/ \"Statement of Admiral Thad w.

The [[Greenland Patrol]] was maintained by the Coast Guard for the duration of the war.\n\n[[File:These Negro members of a Coast Guard Horse Patrol unit patrol beaches in the New Jersey area in all kinds of weather. - NARA - 535853.jpg|thumb|US Coast Guard Horse Patrol, circa 1941-45]]\n\n[[File:Attack on Pearl Harbor Japanese planes view.jpg|thumb|Attack on Pearl Harbor Japanese planes view]]\nThe Coast Guard became directly involved in the first WW2 attack on America in the 1941 [[Attack on Pearl Harbor]]. Supporting U.S. naval forces on December 7, were the Coast Guard cutters, patrol boats, bases, stations, lighthouses and personnel assigned to the 14th Naval District. These units included high-endurance cutter Taney and patrol cutters Tiger and Reliance; buoy tenders Kukui and Walnut; patrol boats CG-400, CG-403, CG-27, and CG-8; a buoy boat and the former Lighthouse Service launch Lehua all participated in the battle shooting at several aircraft. Coast Guard aviator, Lt. Frank Erickson, who later pioneered search and rescue helicopter flight, was standing watch at Ford Island before the attack then took command of an anti-aircraft battery to fight off multiple enemy aircraft.\n\nThe {{USCGC|Taney|WHEC-37|}}, a notable [[World War II]] era high endurance cutter, is the only warship still afloat today (as a [[museum ship]] in [[Baltimore]]) that was present for the [[attack on Pearl Harbor]] in 1941, although she was actually stationed in nearby Honolulu.\n\n\nDuring World War II, there was great concern about enemy vessels nearing U.S. shores, allowing adversarial forces to invade the nation. The beach patrols gained increased importance as security forces with three basic functions: to look for and report on any suspicious vessels operating in the area; to report and prevent attempts of landings by the enemy; and to prevent communication between persons on shore and the enemy at sea.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Young |first1=Stephanie |title=Mounted beach patrol: When the service saddled up |url=https://coastguard.dodlive.mil/2012/08/mounted-beach-patrol-when-the-service-saddled-up |website=Coast Guard Compass |publisher=US Coast Guard |accessdate=13 September 2019 |date=August 28, 2012}} {{PD-notice}}</ref>\n\nThe {{USCGC|Modoc|WPG-46|}}, was peripherally involved in the chase and sinking of the German [[battleship]] [[German battleship Bismarck|''Bismarck'']].\n\nShortly after Germany declared war on the United States, German [[submarine]]s began [[Second happy time|Operation Drumbeat]] ''(\"Paukenschlag\"),'' <!-- was (\"Kesselpauke\"),--> sinking ships off the American coast.  Many Coast Guard cutters were involved in rescue operations following German attacks on American shipping.  The {{USCGC|Icarus|WPC-110|}}, a 165-foot (50 m) cutter that previously had been a rumrunner chaser during [[Prohibition]], sank [[German submarine U-352|''U-352'']] on 9 May 1942, off the coast of [[Cape Lookout, North Carolina]], and took 33 prisoners, the first Germans taken in combat by any U.S. force.\n\nThe {{USCGC|Thetis|WPC-115|}} sank [[German submarine U-157 (1941)|''U-157'']] on 10 June 1942.  During the war, Coast Guard units sank 12 German and two Japanese submarines and captured two German surface vessels.\n\nWhen the {{USCGC|Campbell|WPG-32|}} rammed and sank the German U-606, her enlisted mascot [[Sinbad (USCG)|Sinbad]] became a public hero at home and brought attention to the role of the Coast Guard in convoy protection.\n\nCoast Guardsmen also patrolled the shores of the United States during the war. On 13 June 1942 Seaman 2nd Class John Cullen, patrolling the beach in [[Amagansett, New York]], discovered the first landing of German saboteurs in [[Operation Pastorius]].  Cullen was the first American who actually came in contact with the enemy on the shores of the United States during the war and his report led to the capture of the German sabotage team. For this, Cullen received the [[Legion of Merit]].<ref>http://www.uscg.mil/hq/g-cp/cb/PDFs/Sept_2005.pdf</ref>\n\nThe Coast Guard had 30 [[Edsall class destroyer escort]]s under its command that were used primarily for [[Convoy#World War II|convoy]] escort duty in the [[Battle of the Atlantic|Atlantic]].<ref>{{cite web|title=US Navy Destroyer Escorts|url=http://www.pxarchive.de/home/navy/des.html|accessdate=12 December 2011}}</ref> Other United States Navy ships under Coast Guard command included:<ref name=mfw>{{cite book |last=Willoughby |first=Malcolm F. |authorlink = |title =The U.S. Coast Guard in World War II |url=https://archive.org/details/uscoastguardinw00will |url-access=registration |publisher =[[United States Naval Institute]] |volume = |edition = |date =1957 |location =[[Annapolis, Maryland]] |pages=169&170 |isbn =}}</ref>\n* 75 [[Tacoma-class frigate|patrol frigates]]\n*  8 [[Flower-class corvette]]s\n* 22 [[Troopship]]s\n* 20 [[Amphibious cargo ship]]s\n*  9 [[Attack transport]]s\n* 76 [[Landing Ship, Tank]]\n* 28 [[Landing Craft Infantry]]\n* 18 [[Mettawee class gasoline tanker|gasoline tankers]]\n* 10 [[Submarine chaser]]s\n* 40 [[Yard patrol boat]]s\n\nIn addition to antisubmarine operations,<ref>{{cite video\n | year =1945\n | title =Video: Santo Tomas Prisoners Liberated, 1945/03/01 (1945)\n | url =https://archive.org/details/1945-03-01_Santo_Tomas_Prisoners_Liberated\n | publisher =[[Universal Newsreel]]\n | accessdate =21 February 2012\n}}</ref> the Coast Guard worked closely with the U.S. Navy and [[United States Marine Corps|Marine Corps]]. Many of the [[coxswain]]s of Coast Guard operated American [[landing craft]], such as the Higgins boat ([[LCVP (United States)|LCVP]]), used in amphibious invasions were Coast Guardsmen who had received amphibious training with the cooperation of the U.S. Marine Corps.  Coast Guard cutters and ships partially crewed by Coast Guardsmen were used in the North African invasion of November 1942 ([[Operation Torch]]) and the invasion of [[Sicily]] in 1943 ([[Operation Husky]]). Coast Guard crews staffed 22 tankers, 51 [[List of ships of the United States Army#Large Tug (LT)|large tugs]], 6 [[List of ships of the United States Army#Seacraft Repair Ship|marine repair ships]], and 209 [[List of ships of the United States Army#FS (freight and supply vessels)|freight and supply vessels]] for the [[United States Army]].<ref name=mfw/>\n\nOn 9 September 1942 the [[USS Muskeget (AG-48)|USCGC ''Muskget'' (WAG-48)]] was sunk with a loss of 121 crewmembers while on North Atlantic weather patrol by U-755.\n\nIn November 1942, legislation was passed creating the Coast Guard Women's Reserve, also known as the [[SPARS]]. Led by Captain [[Dorothy C.

Gale-force winds had slowed her progress and she was running low on fuel.  Too far from Newfoundland and unable to make it back to Ireland, the captain, Charles Martin, twenty-six-year-old ex-Navy pilot, decided to fly toward  {{USCGC|Bibb|WPG-31|}} which was on [[Ocean Station Charlie]] in the North Atlantic.  The plane's captain decided to ditch and have his passengers and crew picked up by ''Bibb''.  In 30-foot (10 m) seas, the transfer was both difficult and dangerous.  Initially the ''Bibb's'' captain, Capt. Paul B. Cronk, tried to pass a line to the plane which taxied to the lee side of the cutter.  A collision with the cutter ended this attempt to save the passengers.  With worsening weather, a fifteen-man rubber raft and a small boat were deployed from the ship.  The raft was guided to the escape door of the aircraft.  Passengers jumped into the raft which was then pulled to the boat.  After rescuing 47 of the passengers, worsening conditions and the approach of darkness forced the rescue's suspension.  By dawn, improved weather allowed the rescue to resume and the remaining passengers and crew were transferred to the ''Bibb''.  The rescue made headlines throughout the country and upon their arrival in Boston, ''Bibb'' and her crew received a hero's welcome for having saved all those aboard the ditched ''Bermuda Sky Queen''.<ref name=CGN /><ref>{{British pathe|13803| Newsreel footage of 1947 Bermuda Sky Queen incident}}.

Squadron One assisted in [[Operation Market Time]] by interdicting resupply by sea of [[Viet Cong]] and North Vietnamese forces. The Coast Guard developed a \"piggyback\" weapon that proved highly useful; an [[M2 Browning machine gun]] placed over a [[M29 mortar|81mm mortar]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pcf45.com/misfire/81-50.html|title=Coast Guard Piggyback Weapon|publisher=}}</ref> Seventeen [[Point class cutter|''Point class'']] 82-foot WPB cutters were transferred to coastal waters off Vietnam with their Coast Guard crews under the operational control of the [[U.S. Navy]] [[U.S. Seventh Fleet|Seventh Fleet]].

The ELD's were responsible for the supervision of Army stevedores in the unloading of explosives and ammunition from U.S. Merchant Marine ships. The ELD's were also responsible for assisting the Army in port security operations at each port and eventually were made a part of a Port Security and Waterways Detail (PS&WD) reporting to the Commanding General, United States Army, Vietnam ([[USARV]]). They earned the Army [[Meritorious Unit Commendation]] for their efforts.\n\nOn 13 December 1965 [[Secretary of Defense]] [[Robert McNamara]] requested Coast Guard assistance in constructing a chain of [[LORAN-C]] stations for use by naval vessels and combat aircraft for operations in Southeast Asia.<ref name=Larzelere(1997)193>Larzelere (1997), p. 193</ref> Construction started almost immediately at five locations in Thailand and Vietnam and they were fully operational on 28 October 1966.<ref name=Larzelere(1997)203>Larzelere (1997), p. 203</ref>\n\nOn 22 April 1966, {{USCGC|Planetree|WLB-307|}} arrived in [[Cam Ranh Bay]] to commence [[Aids to Navigation]] (ATON) operations in the coastal waters of South Vietnam. She was responsible for the marking of freshly cut channels and harbors with buoys and daymarks so that merchant and naval ships could safely navigate the waters. This direct support mission ended on 17 May 1971 with the departure of the last buoy tender, {{USCGC|Blackhaw|WLB-390|}}. The buoy tender crews were tasked with training South Vietnamese crews in the ATON effort prior to the departure of the ''Blackhaw'' as a part of the '[[Vietnamization]]' policy of the Nixon Administration.  After May 1971 ATON was serviced on a 'as needed' basis by {{USCGC|Basswood|WLB-388|}} homeported in Guam.\n\nIn August 1970 the Coast Guard finished turning over to the South Vietnamese Navy the patrol boats of Squadron One. The training of South Vietnamese crews had started in February 1969 and continued through to the end of operations for Squadron One. {{USCGC|Yakutat|WHEC-380|}} and {{USCGC|Bering Strait|WHEC-382|}} were turned over to the South Vietnamese Navy on 1 January 1971. Eventually three other WHECs were turned over to the South Vietnamese Navy. The Coast Guard's involvement in the Vietnam War ended at 1246 local time 29 April 1975 when LORAN Station [[Con Son Island#LORAN Station Con Son|Con Son]] went off the air for good.

The stylish new women's uniform was created by Hollywood costume designer [[Edith Head]], upon the request of Capt.

However, the [[Magnuson\u2013Stevens Fisheries Conservation and Management Act of 1976]] brought an increase in offshore fisheries patrols, to which the newer WHECs (the 378s) were redeployed, as the aging boiler-powered World War II-vintage wooden-deckers were gradually retired.\n\n===The Kudirka incident===\n{{wikisource|President Ford\u2013Henry Kissinger\u2013Jerrold Schecter memcon (5 September 1974)#A1|President Ford memcon (5 September 1974)}}\nOn 23 November 1970, Simonas \"Simas\" Kudirka, a [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] seaman of [[Lithuania]]n nationality, leapt from the 400-foot (120&nbsp;m) mother ship ''Sovetskaya Litva'', anchored in American waters (near [[Aquinnah]], [[Massachusetts]] on [[Martha's Vineyard]] Island), aboard the [[USCGC Vigilant (WMEC-617)|USCGC ''Vigilant'']], sailing from [[New Bedford, Massachusetts|New Bedford]].  The Soviets accused Kudirka of theft of 3,000 rubles from the ship's safe.  Ten hours passed; communications difficulties contributed to the delay, as the ship was unfortunately in a \"blind spot\" of Boston Radio's (Marshfield) receivers, resulting in an awkward resort to using the public marine operator.\n\nAfter attempts to get the [[U.S. State Department]] to provide guidance failed, Rear Admiral William B. Ellis, commander of the First Coast Guard District, ordered Commander Ralph E. Eustis to permit a [[KGB]] detachment to board the ''Vigilant'' to return Kudirka to the Soviet ship.  This led to a change in asylum policy by the U.S. Coast Guard. Admiral Ellis and his chief of staff were given administrative punishment under Article 15 of the [[UCMJ]].  Commander Eustis was given a non-punitive [[letter of reprimand]] and assigned to shore duty. Kudirka himself was tried for treason by the Soviet Union and given a ten-year sentence in prison. Subsequent investigations revealed that Kudirka could claim American citizenship through his mother and he was allowed to go to the United States in 1974.\n\nThe incident, known for several years as the Coast Guard's \"Day of Shame,\" was portrayed in a 1978 television movie, ''[[The Defection of Simas Kudirka]]'', with [[Alan Arkin]] playing Kudirka and [[Donald Pleasence]] playing the captain of the Soviet ship and USCGC ''Decisive'' playing the part of USCGC ''Vigilant''. It was also portrayed in the 1973 book ''Day of Shame: The truth about the murderous happenings aboard the Cutter Vigilant during the Russian-American confrontation off Martha's Vineyard'' by Algis Ruksenas.<ref>{{Cite web\n |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=zCcdAAAAMAAJ\n |title=Day of shame: the truth about the ... \u2013 Google Books\n |work=books.google.com\n |accessdate=25 November 2010\n}}</ref>\n\n===The Rescue of AF586===\n\nAt 1430 on 26 October 1978, \"Alfa Foxtrot 586\", a Navy P-3C flying with a crew of fifteen on a reconnaissance mission from the VP-9 detachment at Naval Station Adak, Alaska, ditched near position {{coord|52|39|N|167|24|E}} (approximately 290 miles west of [[Shemya|Shemya Island]] in the Aleutians) following a propeller malfunction and succession of engine fires in its number one engine. VP 9's Aircraft Accident Report recorded conditions at the time of ditching as \"1500 foot ceiling, one and one-half to three miles visibility in rain showers, wave height 12-20 feet, winds 223 degrees at 43 knots.\" Water temperature was approximately 40 degrees.

Arriving on scene after dark in turbulent weather, CG 1500 marked the reported position of the survivors' rafts with a buoy and smoke floats, proceeded to and established communications with a Soviet fishing vessel, Mys Sinyavin, located approximately 25 miles west of datum, and then directed that vessel to both rafts, ultimately resulting in the rescue of ten survivors and the recovery of three dead crewmembers from AF 586. The latter died from exposure after approximately ten - twelve hours in the water-laden rafts, and it is unlikely that the other ten crewmembers could have survived in their rafts much longer as they were all in the advanced stages of hypothermia when rescued by Mys Sinyavin.<ref>https://www.uscg.mil/history/aviation/docs/SAR_1978_CG1500.pdf</ref>\n\n==The 1980s==\n\n===The ''Blackthorn'' Tragedy===\nOn 28 January 1980, the 180-foot buoy tender {{USCGC|Blackthorn|WLB-391}} collided with the 605-foot oil tanker SS ''Capricorn'' and capsized when the ''Capricorn'''s anchor entangled the cutter. Twenty-three Coast Guardsmen were drowned. Coming close behind the loss of 11 men in the collision/sinking of the OCS training ship [[USCGC Cuyahoga (WIX-157)|USCGC ''Cuyahoga'']], the impact of this disaster upon morale in the close-knit service was magnified.<ref>Coast Guard Reserve Magazine, March 2000. \"The 20th Anniversary of the CGC Blackthorn Tragedy\" http://www.uscg.mil/RESERVE/magazine/mag2000/mar2000/blackthorn.htm</ref>\n\n===''Prinsendam'' rescue===\nOn 4 October 1980, the Coast Guard and [[Canadian Coast Guard]] were involved in the rescue of the passengers and crew of the Dutch cruise vessel {{MS|Prinsendam|1973|6}} in the Gulf of Alaska.\n\nA fire broke out on the ''Prinsendam'' off Yakutat, Alaska on 4 October 1980.  The ''Prinsendam'' was {{convert|130|mi|km|sigfig=2}} from the nearest airstrip.  The cruise ship's captain ordered the ship abandoned and the passengers, many elderly, left the ship in the lifeboats.  Coast Guard and Canadian helicopters and the cutters ''[[USCGC Boutwell (WHEC-719)|Boutwell]]'', ''[[USCGC Mellon (WHEC-717)|Mellon]]'', and ''[[USCGC Woodrush (WLB-407)|Woodrush]]'' responded in concert with other vessels in the area. The passenger vessel later capsized and sank.  The rescue is particularly important because of the distance traveled by the rescuers, the coordination of independent organizations and the fact that all 520 passengers and crew were rescued without loss of life or serious injury.<ref name=CGN />\n\n===''Marine Electric'' sinking===\n\nOn February 12, 1983, the cargo ship  ''[[SS Marine Electric]]'' sank in a storm off the coast of [[Virginia]]. Despite efforts by multiple Coast Guard and Navy vessels, most of the crew were lost. As a result of this, the Coast Guard undertook massive review of its rescue procedures, its ship inspection procedures, and its requirements for safety equipment aboard ships. <ref name=\"marine electric\"> [https://www.maritime-executive.com/features/marine-electric-the-wreck-that-changed-the-coast-guard-forever Marine Electric: The Wreck that Changed the Coast Guard Forever], By Corinne Zilnicki 2019-02-11 maritime-executive.com website. </ref> \n\nSome of the reforms that resulted included the items below. <ref name=\"marine electric\"/> \n\n* greater attention to inspection of deck hatch covers during ship inspections. \n* requirement for all ships to provide equipment for survival in cold water for all ship's crew personnel. \n* the establishment of the [[Coast Guard rescue swimmer]] program in 1984, in order to greatly improve readiness and training for all rescue swimmers.\n\n===The Mariel boatlift===\n\nIn April 1980, the government of [[Cuba]] began to allow any person who wanted to leave Cuba to assemble in [[Mariel, Cuba|Mariel]] Harbor and take their own transport.  The U.S. Coast Guard, working out of Seventh District Headquarters in Miami, Florida, rescued boats in difficulty, inspected vessels for adequate safety equipment, and processed refugees.  This task was made even more difficult by a hurricane which swamped many vessels in mid-ocean and by the lack of cooperation by Cuban Border Guard officials.  By May, 600 reservists had been called up, the U.S. Navy provided assistance between Cuba and [[Key West, Florida|Key West]], and the Auxiliary was heavily involved.  125,000 refugees were processed between April and May 1980. (See [[Mariel boatlift]].)\n\n===The end of the lightships===\nThe number of lightships steadily decreased during the 20th century, some replaced by \"Texas Tower\" type structures (e.g., Chesapeake, Buzzards Bay, both now automated) [http://www.uscg.mil/history/h_lightships.html] [http://www.uscg.mil/history/Lightship_Index.html], and others by buoys. However, the Columbia River and Nantucket Shoals Lightships were not replaced by large navigational buoys (LNBs) until 1979 and 1983, respectively, due to the difficulty of anchoring buoys securely at their heavy-weather locations. [http://www.uscg.mil/history/h_lightships.html] [http://www.lighthousefriends.com/light.asp?ID=554].\n\nThe technology of all aids to navigation evolved dramatically during this era, reducing manning and maintenance requirements. The Coast Guard also managed the worldwide VLF [[OMEGA Navigation System]] and operated two of its stations from the early 1970s until its termination in 1997 (having been superseded, though not truly obsoleted, by GPS).\n\n=== Drug War at sea escalates ===\nDuring the 1980s, Coast Guard cutters and aircraft were increasingly deployed to intervene drugs far offshore. While the service has interdicted contraband since its inception, the \"Drug War\" was the biggest effort since Prohibition. Though the Drug War began before the 1980s and continues to this day, it was during the 1980s that the Coast Guard, working with the [[Drug Enforcement Administration]] and other law enforcement agencies, used a blend of new and old laws to interdict far from the shores of the United States. Formerly, it was more difficult to prosecute cases involving seizures made beyond 24 nautical miles from shore. President Ronald Reagan's efforts to secure funding for federal agencies and courts to prosecute cases got the Coast Guard's attention.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}} The Coast Guard instituted a \"no tolerance\" policy toward drugs, began testing its own employees for drug use, and required that all boardings be carried out by trained and armed boarding officers and petty officers. The Caribbean was the focus of efforts in the 1980s, but in recent years the major drug busts at sea have been occurring more in the waters of the Pacific Ocean between California and Peru.\n\n===Libyan attack on LORAN Station Lampedusa===\nOn 15 April 1986, [[Libya]] fired two [[Scud]]s at the U.S. Coast Guard [[LORAN|radio navigation]] station on the Italian island of [[Lampedusa]], in retaliation for the American bombing of [[Tripoli]] and [[Benghazi]]. However, the missiles passed over the island, landing in the sea, and caused no damage. As a result of the attack, the Coast Guard station was commissioned as a NATO base, including security hardening and an armory, as well as an Italian security detail stationed nearby.\n\n===Exxon Valdez oil spill===\nIn March 1989, the oil tanker ''[[Exxon Valdez]]'' struck [[Prince William Sound]]'s [[Bligh Reef]] and spilled 260,000 to 750,000 barrels (41,000 to 119,000 m3) of crude oil. Because the incident took place in navigational waters, the Coast Guard had authority for all activities relating to the cleanup effort. The Coast Guard largely served as the [[Federal On Scene Coordinator|Federal On-Scene Coordinator]] between [[ExxonMobil|Exxon Mobil]] and all of these organizations, acting within authority under the [[Clean Water Act]].\n\nCoast Guard cutters were one of the first to respond to the spill, quickly establishing a safety zone around the stricken ''Exxon Valdez''. At least eleven cutters were present in April 1989, the majority of them overseeing booming and skimming operations. Early that month, Coast Guard vessel activity went through a rapid buildup phase. The Coast Guard maintained a heavy cutter presence for two weeks in mid-April and then reduced it towards the end of the month. Four or five cutters were on hand in early May and that number was reduced to two or three by the end of the month. Three cutters were assigned to cleanup operations by the beginning of June, but only one remained two weeks later \u2013 and it stayed that way for the remainder of the 1989 response.\n\nSeveral [[C-130]]s from [[Coast Guard Air Station Kodiak]] airlifted more than 11 \u00bc tons of cleanup equipment by 10 April 1989. [[Dassault Falcon 20|HU-25 Falcon]] jets from [[Coast Guard Air Station Cape Cod]] flew twice a day tracking oil with side-looking radar equipment. Five Coast Guard helicopters also assisted thirty-nine skimmers working in Prince William Sound.[http://www.uscg.mil/history/articles/EV.pdf]\n\n==The 1990s==\n\n==='90 Operation Desert Shield===\n[[File:Harbor patrol during Operation Desert Shield.jpg|250px|thumbnail|right|Members of Port Security Unit 302 patrol the harbor aboard a Navy harbor patrol boat during Operation Desert Shield.]]\nOn 17 August 1990, at the request of the Joint Chiefs of Staff; the Secretary of Transportation and the Commandant of the Coast Guard committed Coast Guard Law Enforcement Detachments (LEDET) to [[Operation Desert Shield]].  A total of 10 four-person teams served in-theater to support the enforcement of UN sanctions by the Maritime Interdiction Forces.  Approximately 60 percent of the 600 boardings carried out by U.S. forces were either led by or supported with the LEDETs.  Additionally, a 7-man liaison staff was designated by the Commandant as Operational Commander for the Coast Guard forces deployed in theater.  The first boarding of an Iraqi vessel in the theater of operations conducted by a LEDET occurred on 30 August 1990. President George H. W. Bush, on 22 August 1990, authorized the call up of members of the selected reserve to active duty in support of Operation Desert Shield.  Three Port Security Units (PSU), consisting of 550 Coast Guard reservists are ordered to the Persian Gulf in support of Operation Desert Shield. This was the first involuntary overseas mobilization of Coast Guard Reserve PSUs in the Coast Guard Reserve's 50-year history.  A total of 950 Coast Guard reservists were called to active duty.<ref name=\"uscg.mil\">http://www.uscg.mil/history/articles/PersianGulfChron.asp</ref>\n\n==='91 Operation Desert Storm===\nPrior to the launch of Operation Desert Storm, Coast Guard LEDET personnel aboard the {{USS|Nicholas|FFG-47|}} assisted when the frigate cleared eleven Iraqi oil platforms and took 23 prisoners on 18 January 1991.  On 21 April 1991, a Tactical Port Security Boat (TPSB) of PSU 301, stationed in [[Al Jubayl]], Saudi Arabia, was the first boat in the newly reopened harbor of [[Mina Ash Shuwaikh]] in Kuwait City.  Because of certain security concerns, a determination was made to send one of the 22-foot Raider boats belonging to PSU 301 and armed with [[M2 machine gun|M2]] and [[M60 machine gun]]s, to lead the procession into the harbor and provide security for the operation.<ref name=\"uscg.mil\"/>\n\nDuring the war, Saddam Hussein's Iraqi army was seeking to pollute the Persian Gulf by pouring oil into in an effort only partly stymied when Air Force F-111F Aardvarks bombed the source of the deliberate spill. A giant slick was spreading rapidly, wreaking environmental havoc and threatening Saudi desalinization plants that supplied potable water for coalition troops. Two HU-25B Guardians from Coast Guard Air Station Cape Cod, Mass., were dispatched 13 Feb 1991, supported by two HC-130H Hercules from CGAS Clearwater Florida, Operating from Saudi and Bahraini airfields. The HC-130s brought in supplies and returned to the United States 25 Feb.. The HU-25Bs flew over the oil spill to monitor dispersion, rate of flow, the effects of weather and currents, and other data essential for preparing a response plan.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.defensemedianetwork.com/stories/gulf-war-20th-coast-guard-aviators-battled-saddam-husseins-oil-spill/|title=Gulf War 20th: Coast Guard Aviators Battled Saddam Hussein's Oil Spill \u2013 Defense Media Network|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n===Operation Buckshot, \"The Great Flood of '93\"===\nDuring April and again in June 1993, Coast Guard Forces St. Louis (CGF)was activated for flooding on the Mississippi, Missouri and Illinois River basins. The '500 year' flooding closed over {{convert|1250|mi|km|sigfig=2}} of river to navigation and claimed 47 lives. Historic levels of rainfall in the river tributaries caused many levee breaks along the Missouri and Mississippi Rivers displacing thousands of people from their homes and businesses. The commander of CGF St. Louis set into motion a preconceived operations plan to deal with the many requests for assistance from state and local governments for law enforcement assistance, help with sandbagging, water rescues, evacuation of flood victims, and aerial surveillance of levee conditions. The unprecedented duration of the flood also caused Coast Guard personnel to assume some humanitarian services not normally a part of flood operations. Food, water and sandbags were transported to work sites to assist sandbagging efforts by local governments. Red Cross and Salvation Army relief workers were given transportation assistance. Many homeless animals displaced by the flood waters were rescued and turned over to local animal shelters. Utility repair crews were assisted with transportation of personnel and repair parts. Disaster Response Units (DRU) were formed from active duty and reserve units throughout the Second Coast Guard District and consisted of eight members equipped with three 16-foot flood punts powered by 25 horsepower outboard motors. The DRU's accounted for 1517 boat sorties and 3342 hours of underway operations. Coast Guard helicopters from CG Air Stations in Traverse City and Detroit, Michigan; Chicago, Illinois; Elizabeth City, North Carolina; and Mobile, Alabama provided search and rescue, logistical support and aerial survey intelligence. The Coast Guard Auxiliary provided three fixed wing aircraft. There were 473 aircraft sorties with 570 hours of aircraft operations.

The Revenue Cutter Service and the [[United States Life-Saving Service]] were merged to become the Coast Guard per {{USC|14|1}} which states: \"The Coast Guard as established January 28, 1915, shall be a military service and a branch of the armed forces of the United States at all times.\"  In 1939, the [[United States Lighthouse Service]] was merged into the Coast Guard.  The Coast Guard itself was moved to the [[United States Department of Transportation|Department of Transportation]] in 1967, and on 25 February 2003 it became part of the [[United States Department of Homeland Security|Department of Homeland Security]]. However, under {{USC|14|3}} as amended by section 211 of the Coast Guard and Maritime Transportation Act of 2006, upon the declaration of war and when [[United States Congress|Congress]] so directs in the declaration, or when the [[President of the United States|President]] directs, the Coast Guard operates as a service in the [[United States Department of the Navy|Department of the Navy]].\n\n==Early history==\n===The Revenue-Marine===\nThe modern Coast Guard was created in 1915 by the merger of the [[United States Revenue Cutter Service]] and the [[United States Lifesaving Service]], but its roots go back to the early days of the Republic. [[Secretary of the Treasury]] [[Alexander Hamilton]] lobbied Congress to authorize a [[First ten Revenue Service cutters|\"system of cutters\"]] to enforce tariffs, which was major source of revenue for the new nation. On 4 August 1790 (now recognized as the Coast Guard's official birthday), Congress passed the Tariff Act, permitting the construction of ten cutters and the recruitment of 40 revenue officers. Each cutter was assigned one master and three mates who were commissioned officers. In addition each cutter was allowed four mariners and two boys. <ref name=Evans5>Evans, p.5</ref> The cutters were collectively referred to as the \"Revenue-Marine,\" and later officially organized as the \"Revenue Cutter Service.\" Initially, the  was not an organized service. Each revenue cutter operated independently, with each assigned to patrol a section of the east coast and reporting directly to the [[Customs House]] in a major port. From 1790, when the [[Continental Navy]] was disbanded, to 1798, when the [[United States Navy]] was created, these \"revenue cutters\" were the country's only naval force.<ref name=Evans14>Evans, p. 14</ref> As such, the cutters and their crews took on a wide variety of duties beyond the enforcement of tariffs, including combating piracy, rescuing mariners in distress, ferrying government officials, and even carrying mail. In 1794, the Revenue-Marine was given the mission of preventing trading in slaves from Africa to the United States. Between 1794 and 1865, the Service captured approximately 500 slave ships. In 1808, the Service was responsible for enforcing President [[Thomas Jefferson]]'s embargo closing U.S. ports to European trade. The 1822 Timber Act tasked the Revenue Cutter Service with protecting government timber from poachers (this is viewed as the beginning of the Coast Guard's environmental protection mission).<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.uscg.mil/hq/g-cp/comrel/factfile/Factcards/Resources.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=31 July 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060720081519/http://www.uscg.mil/hq/g-cp/comrel/factfile/Factcards/Resources.html |archive-date=20 July 2006 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref> During times of war or crisis, the revenue cutters and their crews were put at the disposal of the Navy.

These stations were normally unoccupied \u2013 essentially storehouses for boats and equipment to be used by volunteers. With the signing of the Newell Act on August 14, 1848, Congress appropriated $10,000 to fund lifesaving stations along the east coast. These were loosely administered by the Revenue-Marine, but still dependent on volunteers (like many fire departments of the time).\n\nThis system continued until 1871 when [[Sumner Kimball]] was appointed Chief of the Revenue Marine Division of the Treasury Department. Kimball convinced Congress to appropriate $200,000 to construct new stations, repair old ones, and provide full-time crews. Shortly thereafter, in 1878, the U.S. Lifesaving Service was officially born and so-named.\n\nAlthough the Revenue Cutter Service is perhaps more recognized as ''the'' predecessor of the Coast Guard, the Lifesaving Service's legacy is apparent in many ways, not the least of which is the prominence of the Coast Guard's search and rescue mission in the eyes of the public. The Coast Guard takes its unofficial search and rescue motto, \"You have to go out, but you don't have to come back,\" from the 1899 regulations of the [[United States Life Saving Service]], which stated:\n\n<blockquote>In attempting a rescue the keeper will select either the boat, breeches buoy, or life car, as in his judgment is best suited to effectively cope with the existing conditions. If the device first selected fails after such trial as satisfies him that no further attempt with it is feasible, he will resort to one of the others, and if that fails, then to the remaining one, and he will not desist from his efforts until by actual trial the impossibility of effecting a rescue is demonstrated. The statement of the keeper that he did not try to use the boat because the sea or surf was too heavy will not be accepted unless attempts to launch it were actually made and failed [underlining added], or unless the conformation of the coast\u2014as bluffs, precipitous banks, etc.\u2014is such as to unquestionably preclude the use of a boat.</blockquote>\n\nThese regulations were repeated in the 1934 Coast Guard regulations.{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}}\n\nA number of Coast Guard traditions survive from, or pay homage to, the Lifesaving Service as well. For example, members of the Lifesaving Service were referred to as \"surfmen,\" and today the [[Surfman Badge]] it awarded to [[coxswains]] who qualify to operate motor lifeboats in heavy surf conditions. The badge's design is similar to the Lifesaving Service's seal.\n\n===Coast Guard Academy===\nThe School of Instruction of the Revenue Cutter Service was established in 1876, near New Bedford, Massachusetts. It used the [[USRC James C. Dobbin (1853)|USRC ''Dobbin'']] for its training exercises.  It moved to Curtis Bay, Maryland in 1900 and then again in 1910 to Fort Trumbull, near New London, Connecticut. The school provided a two-year premise to ship supplemented by some class work and tutoring in technical subjects.  In 1903, the third year of instruction was added.  The school was oriented to line officers, as engineers were hired directly from civilian life.  In 1906, an engineering program for cadets began. Nevertheless, the school remained small, with 5 to 10 cadets per class. In 1914 the School became the Revenue Cutter Academy and with the merger of the Revenue Cutter Service and the Life Saving Service in 1915, it became the [[United States Coast Guard Academy]]. In February 1929, Congress appropriated $1,750,000 for construction of buildings to be used for the academy. The city of New London purchased the land on the Thames River and donated it to the government for use as a Coast Guard facility. Construction began in 1931 and the first cadets began occupying the new facilities in 1932.<ref name=Johnson109>Johnson, p 109</ref>\n\n===Creation of the modern Coast Guard===\nOn 28 January 1915, the United States Revenue Cutter Service and the United States Lifesaving Service were merged by act of Congress to form the United States Coast Guard.<ref name=Johnson32>Johnson, p. 32</ref>  The [[United States Lighthouse Service]] was absorbed by the Coast Guard in 1939.

All cutters were to report to the nearest Naval District commander and stand by for further orders.<ref name=Larzelere(2003)7>Larzelere (2003), p. 7</ref> All normal operations were suspended with the exception of rescues pending orders from the Navy. [[Secretary of the Navy]] [[Josephus Daniels]] directed that although the Coast Guard was then a part of the Navy, that most of the administrative details handled by Coast Guard Headquarters would not be changed.  At the outset of the war the Coast Guard consisted of less than 4000 officers and men, had 23 cruising cutters, 21 harbor cutters, 272 rescue stations and 21 cadets at the Coast Guard Academy.<ref name=Larzelere(2003)11-16>Larzelere (2003), pp. 11\u201416</ref><ref name=Larzelere(2003)21>Larzelere (2003), p.21</ref> The Coast Guard was still in a formative stage of development from the merger of the U.S. Revenue Cutter Service and the U.S. Lifesaving Service.  Because of this fact, there was not much interaction between the two former entities during the war.  A qualified Lifesaving Service surfman who wished to transfer to a cutter had to be reduced to ordinary seaman upon reporting because of a lack of shipboard skills. Because of this transfers were infrequent.  There were no chief petty officers in the Coast Guard at this time and Coast Guard petty officers assigned to Navy ships often served under less experienced supervisors for less pay.<ref name=Larzelere(2003)19>Larzelere (2003), p. 19</ref>\n\n\nCoast Guard cutters were seen by the Navy as ready assets and were used to fill in for a rapidly expanding Navy.  The Navy recognized Coast Guard officers and petty officers as the experienced mariners that they were and often put them on Navy ships to fill in for crew shortages and lack of experience.\n\n=== Sinking of USCGC Tampa ===\nDuring the late afternoon of 26 September 1918, ''Tampa'' parted company with convoy HG-107, which she had just escorted into the [[Irish Sea]] from Gibraltar. Ordered to put into [[Milford Haven]], [[Wales]], she proceeded independently toward her destination.<ref name=Larzelere(2003)47>Larzelere (2003), p. 47</ref> At 1930 that evening, as she transited the [[Bristol Channel]], the warship was spotted by {{SMU|UB-91||2}}. According to the submarine war diary entry, the U-boat dived and maneuvered into an attack position, firing one torpedo out of the stern tube at 2015 from a range of about 550 meters. Minutes later, the torpedo hit ''Tampa'' and exploded portside amidships, throwing up a huge, luminous column of water.<ref name=Johnson55>Johnson, p 55</ref> The cutter sank with all hands: 111 Coast Guardsmen, 4 U.S. Navy sailors, and 16 passengers consisting of 11 [[Royal Navy]] sailors and 5 [[United States Maritime Service|Maritime Service Merchant Marines]].<ref name=Larzelere(2003)49>Larzelere (2003), p. 49</ref> The sinking of ''Tampa'' was the largest single loss of Coast Guard personnel in the war.<ref name=Larzelere(2003)50>Larzelere (2003), p. 50</ref> She sank in the [[Bristol Channel]] at roughly {{coord|50|40|N|6|19|W}}.<ref name=DANFS>''Tampa'', Dictionary of American Naval Fighting Ships, U.S. Navy Naval History & Heritage Command</ref>\n\n\nDuring the war, in 1918, twin sisters Genevieve and Lucille Baker of the Naval Coastal Defense Reserve became the first uniformed women to serve in the Coast Guard.<ref name=\"cbc.ca\">{{cite news| url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/background/military-international/ | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20130328085505/http://www.cbc.ca/news/background/military-international |archivedate=28 March 2013 |title=Women in the military \u2013 international |date=30 May 2006 |work=CBC News | url-status=dead}}</ref><ref name=WHC>\"Women's History Chronology\", Women & the U.

The effort was not entirely successful, due to the slowness of the destroyers.  However, the mission provided many Coast Guard officers and [[petty officer]]s with operational experience which proved invaluable in [[World War II]]. The Navy's epithet of \"Hooligan Navy\" dates from this era, due to the Coast Guard's flexibility in enlisting men discharged from other services to rapidly expand; it has endured due to the high proportion of prior-other-service enlisteds, and become a term of pride within the service.\n\n===1927 Mississippi River flood===\n\nDuring the disastrous [[Great Mississippi Flood of 1927|1927 Mississippi River flood]], the Coast Guard rescued a total of 43,853 persons who they \"removed from perilous positions to places of safety\".  Additionally, they saved 11,313 head of livestock and furnished transportation for 72 persons in need of hospitalization.  In all 674 Coast Guardsmen and 128 Coast Guard vessels and boats served in the relief operations.<ref name=Johnson99>Johnson, p 99</ref>\n\n==The 1930s==\n\n===Increasing regulation of merchant shipping===\nThe Steamboat Inspection Service was merged with the Bureau of Navigation, created in 1884, to oversee the regulation of merchant seamen, on 30 June 1932.\n\nIn 1934, the passenger vessel [[SS Morro Castle (1930)|SS ''Morro Castle'']] suffered a serious fire off the coast of New Jersey, which ultimately claimed the lives of 124 passenger and crew.  The casualty prompted new [[fire protection]] standards for vessels and paved the way for the \"Act of May 27, 1936\", which reorganized and changed the name of the Bureau of Navigation and Steamboat Inspection Service to the Bureau of Marine Inspection and Navigation.\n\nMarine inspection and navigation duties under the Bureau of Marine Inspection and Navigation were temporarily transferred to the Coast Guard by executive order on 28 February 1942. This transfer of duties fit well with the Coast Guard's port safety and security missions, and was made permanent in 1946.\n<ref>[https://www.piersystem.com/go/doc/786/166737/ \"Statement of Admiral Thad w.

The [[Greenland Patrol]] was maintained by the Coast Guard for the duration of the war.\n\n[[File:These Negro members of a Coast Guard Horse Patrol unit patrol beaches in the New Jersey area in all kinds of weather. - NARA - 535853.jpg|thumb|US Coast Guard Horse Patrol, circa 1941-45]]\n\n[[File:Attack on Pearl Harbor Japanese planes view.jpg|thumb|Attack on Pearl Harbor Japanese planes view]]\nThe Coast Guard became directly involved in the first WW2 attack on America in the 1941 [[Attack on Pearl Harbor]]. Supporting U.S. naval forces on December 7, were the Coast Guard cutters, patrol boats, bases, stations, lighthouses and personnel assigned to the 14th Naval District. These units included high-endurance cutter Taney and patrol cutters Tiger and Reliance; buoy tenders Kukui and Walnut; patrol boats CG-400, CG-403, CG-27, and CG-8; a buoy boat and the former Lighthouse Service launch Lehua all participated in the battle shooting at several aircraft. Coast Guard aviator, Lt. Frank Erickson, who later pioneered search and rescue helicopter flight, was standing watch at Ford Island before the attack then took command of an anti-aircraft battery to fight off multiple enemy aircraft.\n\nThe {{USCGC|Taney|WHEC-37|}}, a notable [[World War II]] era high endurance cutter, is the only warship still afloat today (as a [[museum ship]] in [[Baltimore]]) that was present for the [[attack on Pearl Harbor]] in 1941, although she was actually stationed in nearby Honolulu.\n\n\nDuring World War II, there was great concern about enemy vessels nearing U.S. shores, allowing adversarial forces to invade the nation. The beach patrols gained increased importance as security forces with three basic functions: to look for and report on any suspicious vessels operating in the area; to report and prevent attempts of landings by the enemy; and to prevent communication between persons on shore and the enemy at sea.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Young |first1=Stephanie |title=Mounted beach patrol: When the service saddled up |url=https://coastguard.dodlive.mil/2012/08/mounted-beach-patrol-when-the-service-saddled-up |website=Coast Guard Compass |publisher=US Coast Guard |accessdate=13 September 2019 |date=August 28, 2012}} {{PD-notice}}</ref>\n\nThe {{USCGC|Modoc|WPG-46|}}, was peripherally involved in the chase and sinking of the German [[battleship]] [[German battleship Bismarck|''Bismarck'']].\n\nShortly after Germany declared war on the United States, German [[submarine]]s began [[Second happy time|Operation Drumbeat]] ''(\"Paukenschlag\"),'' <!-- was (\"Kesselpauke\"),--> sinking ships off the American coast.  Many Coast Guard cutters were involved in rescue operations following German attacks on American shipping.  The {{USCGC|Icarus|WPC-110|}}, a 165-foot (50 m) cutter that previously had been a rumrunner chaser during [[Prohibition]], sank [[German submarine U-352|''U-352'']] on 9 May 1942, off the coast of [[Cape Lookout, North Carolina]], and took 33 prisoners, the first Germans taken in combat by any U.S. force.\n\nThe {{USCGC|Thetis|WPC-115|}} sank [[German submarine U-157 (1941)|''U-157'']] on 10 June 1942.  During the war, Coast Guard units sank 12 German and two Japanese submarines and captured two German surface vessels.\n\nWhen the {{USCGC|Campbell|WPG-32|}} rammed and sank the German U-606, her enlisted mascot [[Sinbad (USCG)|Sinbad]] became a public hero at home and brought attention to the role of the Coast Guard in convoy protection.\n\nCoast Guardsmen also patrolled the shores of the United States during the war. On 13 June 1942 Seaman 2nd Class John Cullen, patrolling the beach in [[Amagansett, New York]], discovered the first landing of German saboteurs in [[Operation Pastorius]].  Cullen was the first American who actually came in contact with the enemy on the shores of the United States during the war and his report led to the capture of the German sabotage team. For this, Cullen received the [[Legion of Merit]].<ref>http://www.uscg.mil/hq/g-cp/cb/PDFs/Sept_2005.pdf</ref>\n\nThe Coast Guard had 30 [[Edsall class destroyer escort]]s under its command that were used primarily for [[Convoy#World War II|convoy]] escort duty in the [[Battle of the Atlantic|Atlantic]].<ref>{{cite web|title=US Navy Destroyer Escorts|url=http://www.pxarchive.de/home/navy/des.html|accessdate=12 December 2011}}</ref> Other United States Navy ships under Coast Guard command included:<ref name=mfw>{{cite book |last=Willoughby |first=Malcolm F. |authorlink = |title =The U.S. Coast Guard in World War II |url=https://archive.org/details/uscoastguardinw00will |url-access=registration |publisher =[[United States Naval Institute]] |volume = |edition = |date =1957 |location =[[Annapolis, Maryland]] |pages=169&170 |isbn =}}</ref>\n* 75 [[Tacoma-class frigate|patrol frigates]]\n*  8 [[Flower-class corvette]]s\n* 22 [[Troopship]]s\n* 20 [[Amphibious cargo ship]]s\n*  9 [[Attack transport]]s\n* 76 [[Landing Ship, Tank]]\n* 28 [[Landing Craft Infantry]]\n* 18 [[Mettawee class gasoline tanker|gasoline tankers]]\n* 10 [[Submarine chaser]]s\n* 40 [[Yard patrol boat]]s\n\nIn addition to antisubmarine operations,<ref>{{cite video\n | year =1945\n | title =Video: Santo Tomas Prisoners Liberated, 1945/03/01 (1945)\n | url =https://archive.org/details/1945-03-01_Santo_Tomas_Prisoners_Liberated\n | publisher =[[Universal Newsreel]]\n | accessdate =21 February 2012\n}}</ref> the Coast Guard worked closely with the U.S. Navy and [[United States Marine Corps|Marine Corps]].

Gale-force winds had slowed her progress and she was running low on fuel.  Too far from Newfoundland and unable to make it back to Ireland, the captain, Charles Martin, twenty-six-year-old ex-Navy pilot, decided to fly toward  {{USCGC|Bibb|WPG-31|}} which was on [[Ocean Station Charlie]] in the North Atlantic.  The plane's captain decided to ditch and have his passengers and crew picked up by ''Bibb''.  In 30-foot (10 m) seas, the transfer was both difficult and dangerous.  Initially the ''Bibb's'' captain, Capt. Paul B. Cronk, tried to pass a line to the plane which taxied to the lee side of the cutter.  A collision with the cutter ended this attempt to save the passengers.  With worsening weather, a fifteen-man rubber raft and a small boat were deployed from the ship.  The raft was guided to the escape door of the aircraft.  Passengers jumped into the raft which was then pulled to the boat.  After rescuing 47 of the passengers, worsening conditions and the approach of darkness forced the rescue's suspension.  By dawn, improved weather allowed the rescue to resume and the remaining passengers and crew were transferred to the ''Bibb''.  The rescue made headlines throughout the country and upon their arrival in Boston, ''Bibb'' and her crew received a hero's welcome for having saved all those aboard the ditched ''Bermuda Sky Queen''.<ref name=CGN /><ref>{{British pathe|13803| Newsreel footage of 1947 Bermuda Sky Queen incident}}.

This act charged the Coast Guard with ensuring the security of the United States' ports and harbors on a permanent basis.

The ELD's were responsible for the supervision of Army stevedores in the unloading of explosives and ammunition from U.S. Merchant Marine ships. The ELD's were also responsible for assisting the Army in port security operations at each port and eventually were made a part of a Port Security and Waterways Detail (PS&WD) reporting to the Commanding General, United States Army, Vietnam ([[USARV]]). They earned the Army [[Meritorious Unit Commendation]] for their efforts.\n\nOn 13 December 1965 [[Secretary of Defense]] [[Robert McNamara]] requested Coast Guard assistance in constructing a chain of [[LORAN-C]] stations for use by naval vessels and combat aircraft for operations in Southeast Asia.<ref name=Larzelere(1997)193>Larzelere (1997), p. 193</ref> Construction started almost immediately at five locations in Thailand and Vietnam and they were fully operational on 28 October 1966.<ref name=Larzelere(1997)203>Larzelere (1997), p. 203</ref>\n\nOn 22 April 1966, {{USCGC|Planetree|WLB-307|}} arrived in [[Cam Ranh Bay]] to commence [[Aids to Navigation]] (ATON) operations in the coastal waters of South Vietnam.

This direct support mission ended on 17 May 1971 with the departure of the last buoy tender, {{USCGC|Blackhaw|WLB-390|}}. The buoy tender crews were tasked with training South Vietnamese crews in the ATON effort prior to the departure of the ''Blackhaw'' as a part of the '[[Vietnamization]]' policy of the Nixon Administration.  After May 1971 ATON was serviced on a 'as needed' basis by {{USCGC|Basswood|WLB-388|}} homeported in Guam.\n\nIn August 1970 the Coast Guard finished turning over to the South Vietnamese Navy the patrol boats of Squadron One.

However, the [[Magnuson\u2013Stevens Fisheries Conservation and Management Act of 1976]] brought an increase in offshore fisheries patrols, to which the newer WHECs (the 378s) were redeployed, as the aging boiler-powered World War II-vintage wooden-deckers were gradually retired.\n\n===The Kudirka incident===\n{{wikisource|President Ford\u2013Henry Kissinger\u2013Jerrold Schecter memcon (5 September 1974)#A1|President Ford memcon (5 September 1974)}}\nOn 23 November 1970, Simonas \"Simas\" Kudirka, a [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] seaman of [[Lithuania]]n nationality, leapt from the 400-foot (120&nbsp;m) mother ship ''Sovetskaya Litva'', anchored in American waters (near [[Aquinnah]], [[Massachusetts]] on [[Martha's Vineyard]] Island), aboard the [[USCGC Vigilant (WMEC-617)|USCGC ''Vigilant'']], sailing from [[New Bedford, Massachusetts|New Bedford]].  The Soviets accused Kudirka of theft of 3,000 rubles from the ship's safe.  Ten hours passed; communications difficulties contributed to the delay, as the ship was unfortunately in a \"blind spot\" of Boston Radio's (Marshfield) receivers, resulting in an awkward resort to using the public marine operator.\n\nAfter attempts to get the [[U.S. State Department]] to provide guidance failed, Rear Admiral William B. Ellis, commander of the First Coast Guard District, ordered Commander Ralph E. Eustis to permit a [[KGB]] detachment to board the ''Vigilant'' to return Kudirka to the Soviet ship.  This led to a change in asylum policy by the U.S. Coast Guard. Admiral Ellis and his chief of staff were given administrative punishment under Article 15 of the [[UCMJ]].  Commander Eustis was given a non-punitive [[letter of reprimand]] and assigned to shore duty. Kudirka himself was tried for treason by the Soviet Union and given a ten-year sentence in prison. Subsequent investigations revealed that Kudirka could claim American citizenship through his mother and he was allowed to go to the United States in 1974.\n\nThe incident, known for several years as the Coast Guard's \"Day of Shame,\" was portrayed in a 1978 television movie, ''[[The Defection of Simas Kudirka]]'', with [[Alan Arkin]] playing Kudirka and [[Donald Pleasence]] playing the captain of the Soviet ship and USCGC ''Decisive'' playing the part of USCGC ''Vigilant''. It was also portrayed in the 1973 book ''Day of Shame: The truth about the murderous happenings aboard the Cutter Vigilant during the Russian-American confrontation off Martha's Vineyard'' by Algis Ruksenas.<ref>{{Cite web\n |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=zCcdAAAAMAAJ\n |title=Day of shame: the truth about the ... \u2013 Google Books\n |work=books.google.com\n |accessdate=25 November 2010\n}}</ref>\n\n===The Rescue of AF586===\n\nAt 1430 on 26 October 1978, \"Alfa Foxtrot 586\", a Navy P-3C flying with a crew of fifteen on a reconnaissance mission from the VP-9 detachment at Naval Station Adak, Alaska, ditched near position {{coord|52|39|N|167|24|E}} (approximately 290 miles west of [[Shemya|Shemya Island]] in the Aleutians) following a propeller malfunction and succession of engine fires in its number one engine. VP 9's Aircraft Accident Report recorded conditions at the time of ditching as \"1500 foot ceiling, one and one-half to three miles visibility in rain showers, wave height 12-20 feet, winds 223 degrees at 43 knots.\" Water temperature was approximately 40 degrees.

Arriving on scene after dark in turbulent weather, CG 1500 marked the reported position of the survivors' rafts with a buoy and smoke floats, proceeded to and established communications with a Soviet fishing vessel, Mys Sinyavin, located approximately 25 miles west of datum, and then directed that vessel to both rafts, ultimately resulting in the rescue of ten survivors and the recovery of three dead crewmembers from AF 586. The latter died from exposure after approximately ten - twelve hours in the water-laden rafts, and it is unlikely that the other ten crewmembers could have survived in their rafts much longer as they were all in the advanced stages of hypothermia when rescued by Mys Sinyavin.<ref>https://www.uscg.mil/history/aviation/docs/SAR_1978_CG1500.pdf</ref>\n\n==The 1980s==\n\n===The ''Blackthorn'' Tragedy===\nOn 28 January 1980, the 180-foot buoy tender {{USCGC|Blackthorn|WLB-391}} collided with the 605-foot oil tanker SS ''Capricorn'' and capsized when the ''Capricorn'''s anchor entangled the cutter. Twenty-three Coast Guardsmen were drowned. Coming close behind the loss of 11 men in the collision/sinking of the OCS training ship [[USCGC Cuyahoga (WIX-157)|USCGC ''Cuyahoga'']], the impact of this disaster upon morale in the close-knit service was magnified.<ref>Coast Guard Reserve Magazine, March 2000. \"The 20th Anniversary of the CGC Blackthorn Tragedy\" http://www.uscg.mil/RESERVE/magazine/mag2000/mar2000/blackthorn.htm</ref>\n\n===''Prinsendam'' rescue===\nOn 4 October 1980, the Coast Guard and [[Canadian Coast Guard]] were involved in the rescue of the passengers and crew of the Dutch cruise vessel {{MS|Prinsendam|1973|6}} in the Gulf of Alaska.\n\nA fire broke out on the ''Prinsendam'' off Yakutat, Alaska on 4 October 1980.  The ''Prinsendam'' was {{convert|130|mi|km|sigfig=2}} from the nearest airstrip.  The cruise ship's captain ordered the ship abandoned and the passengers, many elderly, left the ship in the lifeboats.  Coast Guard and Canadian helicopters and the cutters ''[[USCGC Boutwell (WHEC-719)|Boutwell]]'', ''[[USCGC Mellon (WHEC-717)|Mellon]]'', and ''[[USCGC Woodrush (WLB-407)|Woodrush]]'' responded in concert with other vessels in the area. The passenger vessel later capsized and sank.  The rescue is particularly important because of the distance traveled by the rescuers, the coordination of independent organizations and the fact that all 520 passengers and crew were rescued without loss of life or serious injury.<ref name=CGN />\n\n===''Marine Electric'' sinking===\n\nOn February 12, 1983, the cargo ship  ''[[SS Marine Electric]]'' sank in a storm off the coast of [[Virginia]]. Despite efforts by multiple Coast Guard and Navy vessels, most of the crew were lost. As a result of this, the Coast Guard undertook massive review of its rescue procedures, its ship inspection procedures, and its requirements for safety equipment aboard ships. <ref name=\"marine electric\"> [https://www.maritime-executive.com/features/marine-electric-the-wreck-that-changed-the-coast-guard-forever Marine Electric: The Wreck that Changed the Coast Guard Forever], By Corinne Zilnicki 2019-02-11 maritime-executive.com website. </ref> \n\nSome of the reforms that resulted included the items below. <ref name=\"marine electric\"/> \n\n* greater attention to inspection of deck hatch covers during ship inspections. \n* requirement for all ships to provide equipment for survival in cold water for all ship's crew personnel. \n* the establishment of the [[Coast Guard rescue swimmer]] program in 1984, in order to greatly improve readiness and training for all rescue swimmers.\n\n===The Mariel boatlift===\n\nIn April 1980, the government of [[Cuba]] began to allow any person who wanted to leave Cuba to assemble in [[Mariel, Cuba|Mariel]] Harbor and take their own transport.  The U.S. Coast Guard, working out of Seventh District Headquarters in Miami, Florida, rescued boats in difficulty, inspected vessels for adequate safety equipment, and processed refugees.  This task was made even more difficult by a hurricane which swamped many vessels in mid-ocean and by the lack of cooperation by Cuban Border Guard officials.  By May, 600 reservists had been called up, the U.S. Navy provided assistance between Cuba and [[Key West, Florida|Key West]], and the Auxiliary was heavily involved.  125,000 refugees were processed between April and May 1980. (See [[Mariel boatlift]].)\n\n===The end of the lightships===\nThe number of lightships steadily decreased during the 20th century, some replaced by \"Texas Tower\" type structures (e.g., Chesapeake, Buzzards Bay, both now automated) [http://www.uscg.mil/history/h_lightships.html] [http://www.uscg.mil/history/Lightship_Index.html], and others by buoys. However, the Columbia River and Nantucket Shoals Lightships were not replaced by large navigational buoys (LNBs) until 1979 and 1983, respectively, due to the difficulty of anchoring buoys securely at their heavy-weather locations. [http://www.uscg.mil/history/h_lightships.html] [http://www.lighthousefriends.com/light.asp?ID=554].\n\nThe technology of all aids to navigation evolved dramatically during this era, reducing manning and maintenance requirements. The Coast Guard also managed the worldwide VLF [[OMEGA Navigation System]] and operated two of its stations from the early 1970s until its termination in 1997 (having been superseded, though not truly obsoleted, by GPS).\n\n=== Drug War at sea escalates ===\nDuring the 1980s, Coast Guard cutters and aircraft were increasingly deployed to intervene drugs far offshore. While the service has interdicted contraband since its inception, the \"Drug War\" was the biggest effort since Prohibition. Though the Drug War began before the 1980s and continues to this day, it was during the 1980s that the Coast Guard, working with the [[Drug Enforcement Administration]] and other law enforcement agencies, used a blend of new and old laws to interdict far from the shores of the United States. Formerly, it was more difficult to prosecute cases involving seizures made beyond 24 nautical miles from shore. President Ronald Reagan's efforts to secure funding for federal agencies and courts to prosecute cases got the Coast Guard's attention.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}} The Coast Guard instituted a \"no tolerance\" policy toward drugs, began testing its own employees for drug use, and required that all boardings be carried out by trained and armed boarding officers and petty officers. The Caribbean was the focus of efforts in the 1980s, but in recent years the major drug busts at sea have been occurring more in the waters of the Pacific Ocean between California and Peru.\n\n===Libyan attack on LORAN Station Lampedusa===\nOn 15 April 1986, [[Libya]] fired two [[Scud]]s at the U.S. Coast Guard [[LORAN|radio navigation]] station on the Italian island of [[Lampedusa]], in retaliation for the American bombing of [[Tripoli]] and [[Benghazi]]. However, the missiles passed over the island, landing in the sea, and caused no damage. As a result of the attack, the Coast Guard station was commissioned as a NATO base, including security hardening and an armory, as well as an Italian security detail stationed nearby.\n\n===Exxon Valdez oil spill===\nIn March 1989, the oil tanker ''[[Exxon Valdez]]'' struck [[Prince William Sound]]'s [[Bligh Reef]] and spilled 260,000 to 750,000 barrels (41,000 to 119,000 m3) of crude oil. Because the incident took place in navigational waters, the Coast Guard had authority for all activities relating to the cleanup effort. The Coast Guard largely served as the [[Federal On Scene Coordinator|Federal On-Scene Coordinator]] between [[ExxonMobil|Exxon Mobil]] and all of these organizations, acting within authority under the [[Clean Water Act]].\n\nCoast Guard cutters were one of the first to respond to the spill, quickly establishing a safety zone around the stricken ''Exxon Valdez''. At least eleven cutters were present in April 1989, the majority of them overseeing booming and skimming operations. Early that month, Coast Guard vessel activity went through a rapid buildup phase. The Coast Guard maintained a heavy cutter presence for two weeks in mid-April and then reduced it towards the end of the month. Four or five cutters were on hand in early May and that number was reduced to two or three by the end of the month. Three cutters were assigned to cleanup operations by the beginning of June, but only one remained two weeks later \u2013 and it stayed that way for the remainder of the 1989 response.\n\nSeveral [[C-130]]s from [[Coast Guard Air Station Kodiak]] airlifted more than 11 \u00bc tons of cleanup equipment by 10 April 1989. [[Dassault Falcon 20|HU-25 Falcon]] jets from [[Coast Guard Air Station Cape Cod]] flew twice a day tracking oil with side-looking radar equipment. Five Coast Guard helicopters also assisted thirty-nine skimmers working in Prince William Sound.[http://www.uscg.mil/history/articles/EV.pdf]\n\n==The 1990s==\n\n==='90 Operation Desert Shield===\n[[File:Harbor patrol during Operation Desert Shield.jpg|250px|thumbnail|right|Members of Port Security Unit 302 patrol the harbor aboard a Navy harbor patrol boat during Operation Desert Shield.]]\nOn 17 August 1990, at the request of the Joint Chiefs of Staff; the Secretary of Transportation and the Commandant of the Coast Guard committed Coast Guard Law Enforcement Detachments (LEDET) to [[Operation Desert Shield]].  A total of 10 four-person teams served in-theater to support the enforcement of UN sanctions by the Maritime Interdiction Forces.  Approximately 60 percent of the 600 boardings carried out by U.S. forces were either led by or supported with the LEDETs.  Additionally, a 7-man liaison staff was designated by the Commandant as Operational Commander for the Coast Guard forces deployed in theater.  The first boarding of an Iraqi vessel in the theater of operations conducted by a LEDET occurred on 30 August 1990. President George H. W. Bush, on 22 August 1990, authorized the call up of members of the selected reserve to active duty in support of Operation Desert Shield.  Three Port Security Units (PSU), consisting of 550 Coast Guard reservists are ordered to the Persian Gulf in support of Operation Desert Shield. This was the first involuntary overseas mobilization of Coast Guard Reserve PSUs in the Coast Guard Reserve's 50-year history.  A total of 950 Coast Guard reservists were called to active duty.<ref name=\"uscg.mil\">http://www.uscg.mil/history/articles/PersianGulfChron.asp</ref>\n\n==='91 Operation Desert Storm===\nPrior to the launch of Operation Desert Storm, Coast Guard LEDET personnel aboard the {{USS|Nicholas|FFG-47|}} assisted when the frigate cleared eleven Iraqi oil platforms and took 23 prisoners on 18 January 1991.  On 21 April 1991, a Tactical Port Security Boat (TPSB) of PSU 301, stationed in [[Al Jubayl]], Saudi Arabia, was the first boat in the newly reopened harbor of [[Mina Ash Shuwaikh]] in Kuwait City.  Because of certain security concerns, a determination was made to send one of the 22-foot Raider boats belonging to PSU 301 and armed with [[M2 machine gun|M2]] and [[M60 machine gun]]s, to lead the procession into the harbor and provide security for the operation.<ref name=\"uscg.mil\"/>\n\nDuring the war, Saddam Hussein's Iraqi army was seeking to pollute the Persian Gulf by pouring oil into in an effort only partly stymied when Air Force F-111F Aardvarks bombed the source of the deliberate spill. A giant slick was spreading rapidly, wreaking environmental havoc and threatening Saudi desalinization plants that supplied potable water for coalition troops. Two HU-25B Guardians from Coast Guard Air Station Cape Cod, Mass., were dispatched 13 Feb 1991, supported by two HC-130H Hercules from CGAS Clearwater Florida, Operating from Saudi and Bahraini airfields. The HC-130s brought in supplies and returned to the United States 25 Feb.. The HU-25Bs flew over the oil spill to monitor dispersion, rate of flow, the effects of weather and currents, and other data essential for preparing a response plan.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.defensemedianetwork.com/stories/gulf-war-20th-coast-guard-aviators-battled-saddam-husseins-oil-spill/|title=Gulf War 20th: Coast Guard Aviators Battled Saddam Hussein's Oil Spill \u2013 Defense Media Network|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n===Operation Buckshot, \"The Great Flood of '93\"===\nDuring April and again in June 1993, Coast Guard Forces St. Louis (CGF)was activated for flooding on the Mississippi, Missouri and Illinois River basins. The '500 year' flooding closed over {{convert|1250|mi|km|sigfig=2}} of river to navigation and claimed 47 lives. Historic levels of rainfall in the river tributaries caused many levee breaks along the Missouri and Mississippi Rivers displacing thousands of people from their homes and businesses. The commander of CGF St. Louis set into motion a preconceived operations plan to deal with the many requests for assistance from state and local governments for law enforcement assistance, help with sandbagging, water rescues, evacuation of flood victims, and aerial surveillance of levee conditions. The unprecedented duration of the flood also caused Coast Guard personnel to assume some humanitarian services not normally a part of flood operations. Food, water and sandbags were transported to work sites to assist sandbagging efforts by local governments. Red Cross and Salvation Army relief workers were given transportation assistance. Many homeless animals displaced by the flood waters were rescued and turned over to local animal shelters. Utility repair crews were assisted with transportation of personnel and repair parts. Disaster Response Units (DRU) were formed from active duty and reserve units throughout the Second Coast Guard District and consisted of eight members equipped with three 16-foot flood punts powered by 25 horsepower outboard motors. The DRU's accounted for 1517 boat sorties and 3342 hours of underway operations. Coast Guard helicopters from CG Air Stations in Traverse City and Detroit, Michigan; Chicago, Illinois; Elizabeth City, North Carolina; and Mobile, Alabama provided search and rescue, logistical support and aerial survey intelligence. The Coast Guard Auxiliary provided three fixed wing aircraft. There were 473 aircraft sorties with 570 hours of aircraft operations. CGF St. Louis stood down from the alert phase of operations on 27 August. A total of 380 Active Duty, 352 Reserve, 179 Auxiliary, and 5 Coast Guard civilians were involved in the operation.<ref>After Action Report for Operation Buckshot, Commander, Coast Guard Forces St. Louis, 2nd Coast Guard District, 15 August 1993</ref>\n\n===1994 Cuban boat rescues===\n[[File:USCGC Tamaroa WUEC-166 1990.jpg|right|thumb|300px|[[USCGC Tamaroa|USCGC ''Tamaroa'']] (WMEC-166), best known for her rescues during the \"[[1991 Halloween Nor'easter|Perfect Storm]]\" of 1991.]]\nIn 1994, about 38,000 Cubans attempted to sail from Cuba to Florida, many on homemade rafts.  The Coast Guard and Navy performed intensive search and rescue efforts to rescue rafters at sea. Sixteen 110-foot (34 m) cutters\u2014half the complement of the Coast Guard\u2014were involved in this operation, as well as buoy tenders not normally assigned to high seas duty. Due to a change in Presidential policy, rescued Cubans were sent to the U.S. Naval Station at [[Guant\u00e1namo Bay, Cuba|Guantanamo Bay]], Cuba.\n\n===1999 Kosovo===\nIn the summer of 1999, {{USCGC|Bear|WMEC-901}} deployed to the Adriatic Sea in support of [[Operation Allied Force]] and [[Operation Noble Anvil]] with the {{USS|Theodore Roosevelt|CVN-71}} Battle Group providing surface surveillance and SAR response for the Sea Combat Commander, and force protection for the Amphibious Ready Group operating near Albania. The ''Bear'' also provided security to the US Army vessels transporting military cargo between Italy and Albania. This escort operation took ''Bear'' up to the Albanian coastline, well within enemy surface-to-surface missile range. ''Bear'' earned the [[Kosovo Campaign Medal]] and the [[NATO Kosovo Medal]].[http://www.uscg.mil/history/uscghist/KosovoBear.pdf]\n\n==The 2000s==\n:''For details on the Coast Guard's response to the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]], see [[Missions of the United States Coast Guard]] above.''\n\n===Transfer to the Department of Homeland Security===\nThe Coast Guard was transferred from the Department of Transportation to the [[Department of Homeland Security]] on 1 March 2003 under the [[Homeland Security Act]] (Public Law No. 107-296).\n\nIn 2002, the Coast Guard sent several 110-foot (34 m) cutters to the [[Persian Gulf]] to enforce the U.N. embargo on goods to and from [[Iraq]]. [[Port Security Unit]]s and [[Naval Coastal Warfare]] units also accompanied the U.S. military buildup.\n\n===Wars in Iraq and Afghanistan===\n[[File:US Coast Guard Transportable Port Security Unit.jpg|thumb|US Coast Guard Port Security Unit patrols Umm Qasr]]\nDuring [[Operation Iraqi Freedom]] and [[Operation Enduring Freedom]], the Coast Guard had deployed its largest contingent of Coast Guardsmen and assets overseas since the Vietnam War.

He was killed in a suicide boat attack on a [[Basra]] oil terminal off the coast of [[Iraq]] as the crew of the ''Firebolt'' performed their maritime security mission.\n\nAt the height its involvement in both wars, the Coast Guard deployed over 1,200 men and women, including about 500 reservists, 11 ships (two large cutters, a buoy tender, and eight patrol boats), 4 port-security units, law enforcement detachments, and other specialized teams and support staff in order to perform a wide range of operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Kuwait, and the Persian Gulf.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://usmilitary.about.com/od/coastguard/a/uscgwar.htm|title=Navy Boarding Parties|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nCoast Guard units and personnel \u2013 both active and reserve component \u2013 continue to deploy to the Middle East region even after the end of Operation Iraqi Freedom and Operation New Dawn.

The crews also assessed storm damage to offshore oil platforms and refineries.  More than 2,400 personnel from all districts conducted search, rescue, response, waterway reconstitution and environmental impact assessment operations. In total, the Coast Guard air and boat rescued more than 33,500 people and assisted with the joint-agency evacuation of an additional 9,400 patients and medical personnel from hospitals in the Gulf coast region.\n\nIn May 2006, at the Change of Command ceremony when Admiral [[Thad Allen]] took over as Commandant, [[President of the United States|President]] [[George W.

Although the program involves obtaining new ships and aircraft, Deepwater also involves upgraded information technology for command, control, communications and computers, intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (C4ISR).\n\nA key part of the Deepwater system is the Maritime Security Cutter, Large (WMSL), which is designed to replace the 378-foot (115 m) high-endurance cutters currently on duty.  This ship will have a length of 421 feet (128 m), be powered by a [[gas turbine]] engine with two auxiliary [[diesel engine]]s, and be capable of 12,000 nautical mile (22,000&nbsp;km) voyages lasting up to 60 days.  The keel laying of the {{USCGC|Bertholf}} (WMSL-750), the first ship in this class, took place in September 2004. The ship was delivered in 2008. The second keel, {{USCGC|Waesche|WMSL-751}}, was laid in 2005.\n\nAnother key vessel is the Maritime Security Cutter, Medium (WMSM), which will be 341&nbsp;ft (104 m) long, displace 2,921 long tons (2,968 metric tons), and be capable of 45-day patrols of up to 9,000 nautical miles (17,000&nbsp;km).

Secondary polycythemia resolves when the underlying cause is treated.\n\nSecondary polycythemia in which the production of erythropoietin increases appropriately is called '''physiologic polycythemia.'''\n\nConditions which may result in a physiologically appropriate polycythemia include:\n*Altitude related - This physiologic polycythemia is a normal adaptation to living at high altitudes (see [[altitude sickness]]). Many athletes train at high altitude to take advantage of this effect &mdash; a legal form of blood doping.

This includes patients who have a special form of hemoglobin known as Hb Chesapeake, which has a greater inherent affinity for oxygen than normal adult hemoglobin. This reduces oxygen delivery to the kidneys, causing increased erythropoietin production and a resultant polycythemia. Hemoglobin Kempsey also produces a similar clinical picture.
