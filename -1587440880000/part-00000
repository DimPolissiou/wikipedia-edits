The song was originally performed in the film by [[Jeremy Irons]], with [[Whoopi Goldberg]], [[Cheech Marin]], and [[Jim Cummings]] providing supporting vocals; Cummings performed partial material for [[Scar (The Lion King)|Scar]] after Irons' voice gave out.\n\nThe song is also featured in the 1997 [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] musical ''[[The Lion King]]'', with [[John Vickery (actor)|John Vickery]], [[Kevin Cahoon]], [[Stanley Wayne Mathis]], and [[Tracy Nicole Chapman]] performing it in the original Broadway cast for the musical. [[Chiwetel Ejiofor]] performed an altered version of the song in the 2019 [[The Lion King (2019 film)|film adaptation]].\n\n==''The Lion King''==\nThe song is performed as a musical number by [[Scar (The Lion King)|Scar]], who lusts for the position as king of the Pride Lands. Scar is inspired to develop a plot for both his brother Mufasa and his nephew Simba to be murdered, and tells about this plan through song to a large army of [[spotted hyena]] minions by his pledge to spare the hungry animals from starvation if they provide him with assistance.\n\n====Production====\nOriginally, the song (first called \"Thanks to Me\") was about Scar introducing the hyenas to the lionesses after he pronounced himself king. This idea was eventually scrapped and replaced with ''Be Prepared''.{{citation needed|date=August 2019}} A reprise of the song after Mufasa's death was also cut from the film, but is featured in the [[The Lion King (musical)|musical version]].{{citation needed|date=August 2019}}\n\nIn the beginning of the second verse, an army of hyenas is shown [[Goose step|goose-stepping]] in front of Scar, who is perched on an overlooking cliff in resemblance of [[Adolf Hitler]] with upwards of 22 beams of light pointing straight-up (resembling the [[Cathedral of light]] featured in many of the [[Nuremberg Rallies]]). Shadows cast onto the cliff evoke for a brief second monumental columns. This is modeled after footage from the [[Leni Riefenstahl]]'s [[Nazi Germany|Nazi]] propaganda movie ''[[Triumph of the Will]]''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.businessinsider.com/the-lion-king-be-prepared-nazi-film-2014-6|title=The Darkest Song From 'The Lion King' Was Based On A 1935 Nazi Propaganda Film|last=Pallotta|first=Frank|website=Business Insider|access-date=2019-01-29}}</ref>\n\nThough [[Jeremy Irons]] is credited for performing the lead vocals on the song, at the 2012 [[Calgary Comic and Entertainment Expo]], [[Jim Cummings]], who also played Ed, stated that he sang most of the song, and that Irons only did some of the talking.<ref>{{cite web|title=Jim Cummings on Hakuna Matata and Be Prepared|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wmrdn9eFTK8&t=3m15s|date=3 May 2012}}</ref> However, footage from the film's recording sessions available on the film's 2017 Blu-ray release reveals that Irons sang the entire first verse of the song, while a cursory analysis of the recording suggests (due to a subtle but evident shift in vocal timbre heard in Scar's lead vocal) that Cummings only sang the final verse (\"So be prepared for the coup of the century...\") in the final cut of the film. Cummings has also confirmed this in other interviews, claiming that he sang this last verse due to Irons developing vocal problems during the recording session.<ref>https://www.huffingtonpost.com/jim-hill/lion-king-voice-actors_b_968140.html</ref>\n\n====Original recording====\nOn the original soundtrack recording, Scar opens the song with a [[soliloquy]]:\n\n{{cquote|I never thought hyenas essential. They're crude and unspeakably plain. But maybe they've a glimmer of potential if allied to my vision and brain.}}\n\nIn the film, this is cut and the song begins immediately. This was due to a plot adjustment.<ref>[http://www.lionking.org/scripts/Script.html#prepared TLK Script (HTML 3.0 Version)<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> The soliloquy had Scar considering using the hyenas for his plot, but in the final version of the story he had already used the hyenas in his plans before the song. The soliloquy is, however, included in the Broadway version.{{citation needed|date=August 2019}}\n\n===International versions===\nWhen the movie was first released in 1994, it numbered complexively 28 versions worldwide, including a special [[Zulu language|Zulu]] version made in [[South Africa]]. This is not just the only Zulu dubbing ever made by Disney, but also the only dubbing made in any [[Languages of Africa|African language]], other than [[Arabic]].<ref>{{Cite

dubbings has increased to 41 official versions, to which some unofficial versions have been added by local TV stations and studios in their local languages: namely [[Abaza language|Abaza]], [[Albanian

film as it was considered too dark.]]\n\nDuring early production of the film, there was a reprise created of the song, taking place after Scar has assumed power over the Pride Lands. He is given the idea by Zazu to find a mate. So he tries seducing [[Nala (The Lion King)|Nala]], who refuses his advances, and is therefore banished by Scar. He then unleashes the hyenas upon the Pride Lands as his \"executive staff\". The reprise was ultimately removed from the film and the concept was later recycled in \"[[The Madness of King Scar]]\" was included in the Broadway musical version of the film.<ref>{{cite video|title=Scar Wants Nala as His Queen|author=Allers, Roger|authorlink=Roger Allers|location=The Lion King: Diamond Edition |type = Blu-ray |year=2011 |publisher=Walt Disney Home Entertainment}}</ref>\n\n==''The Lion King 1\u00bd''==\nIn [[DisneyToon Studios|DisneyToon]]'s 2004 direct-to-video film ''[[The Lion King 1\u00bd]]'', the music from the beginning of the song is briefly heard as [[Timon and Pumbaa]] tour Scar's lair as a possible new home, commenting on how it is quiet, secluded and with no uninvited visitors. The shadows of the goose-stepping hyena army are then seen marching in front of them, though they haven't started singing yet. Timon and Pumbaa stare at them for a few seconds, and remark that the hyenas \"ain't the traveling company of [[Riverdance]].\" They then riverdance out of the scene.\n\n==''The Lion King'' (2019)==\nOn February 3, 2019, Skyler Shuler of The DisInsider reported that \"Be Prepared\" would be one of the songs featured in the [[The Lion King (2019 film)|2019 remake of ''The Lion King'']], directed by [[Jon Favreau]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.broadwayworld.com/article/Be-Prepared-Will-Be-Featured-in-THE-LION-KING-Live-Action-Film-20190203|title='Be Prepared' Will Be Featured in THE LION KING Live Action Film|first=Stephanie|last=Wild|work=BroadwayWorld|date=February 3, 2019|accessdate=February 3, 2019}}</ref> <ref>{{cite web|url=https://ew.com/movies/2019/04/29/the-lion-king-scar/|title=The Lion King\u2019s Chiwetel Ejiofor on the diabolical psychology of Scar|first=Marc|last=Snetiker|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|date=April 29, 2019|accessdate=April 30, 2019}}</ref> On June 24, 2019, the remake was confirmed to feature a reworked version of the song.<ref name=\"Soundtrack\">{{cite web|url=http://collider.com/the-lion-king-soundtrack-details-new-song|title=\u2018The Lion King\u2019 Soundtrack Details Revealed; Includes New Elton John Song|first=Adam|last=Chitwood|work=[[Collider]]|date=June 24, 2019|accessdate=June 24, 2019}}</ref> The song was considered for deletion since Favreau felt a bombastic villain song would clash too much with the tone of the adaptation, but Tim Rice and Hans Zimmer were able to create a shortened, updated version of the song that would reflect Scar's different character dynamic with the hyenas while still remaining faithful enough to the original.\n<ref name=\"Director's commentary\">Jon Favreau: ''The Lion King'', audio commentary to the Blu-ray version of the film</ref>\n\n==''The Lion King'' Broadway musical==\nAs in the original soundtrack recording, Scar begins the song with a brief soliloquy. The song is similar to its film counterpart in most respects, including the goose stepping hyenas, but there is a dance number performed by the hyena ensemble halfway through.  Scar later sings a brief [[reprise]] while declaring himself king at Mufasa's funeral in which he introduces the hyenas as his direct and privileged minions (the aforementioned deleted reprise from the film).  However, the Broadway reprise was not featured in the soundtrack, and is instead replaced with a sinister chord at the end of the song \"Rafiki Mourns\". In other soundtracks from different productions, the song is not represented at all.\n\n==''Festival of The Lion King''==\nIn [[Walt Disney World]]'s [[Disney's Animal Kingdom|Animal Kingdom]]'s ''[[Festival of the Lion King]]'', Kiume sings the song while the theater takes on a darker tone with the male dancers carrying spears and shields, while the female dancers dance with streamers. After Kiume sings the first verse, the solo hyena performer does a tribal dance with a fire torch. In the finale, when the snippet of \"Be Prepared\" is sung, the hyena comes back out but dances with blades.\n==Reception==\n===Original Version===\nThe song has garnered positive reaction and review. Becky Fuller from [[Screen Rant]] gave the song's original version a positive review. He describes the song as \"camp, fun, and just scary enough to make younger viewers feel a little on edge\" and perfectly summed up Scar's character. He praised Jeremy Irons' performance, citing his deep, dulcet tones is perfect for the song. <ref>{{cite web|url=https://screenrant.com/lion-king-2019-be-prepared-villain-song-bad/|title=The Lion King 2019 Gets All the Songs Right (Except Be Prepared)|first=Becky|last=Fuller|work=[[Screen Rant]]|date=July 21, 2019|accessdate=August 14, 2019}}</ref>\n[[Glen Weldon]] from [[NPR]] also praised the song as indelible and iconic for its pure expression of Scar's character.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/2019/07/17/742204352/lion-king-2019-be-prepared-villain-anthem-jeremy-irons-chiwetel-ejiofor|title=The Lion King Had the Perfect Villain Song, This Time Be Prepared for Less|first=Glen|last=Weldon|work=[[NPR]]|date=July 17, 2019|accessdate=August 14, 2019}}</ref> Hannah-Rose Yee from Stylist cited Be Prepared as one of the best songs in the film for mixing humor and tragedy in the lyrics that builds up the character's deluded aspiration and twisted desire.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.stylist.co.uk/life/lion-king-live-action-be-prepared-cut-elton-john-beyonce/271463|title=Lion King fans, beware: the live action movie has cut the film's best song|first=Hannah-Rose|last=Yee|work=Stylist|date=June 14, 2018|accessdate=August 14, 2019}}</ref>\n\n===2019 Remake===\nThe remake song received a mixed to negative reaction.

The song was originally performed in the film by [[Jeremy Irons]], with [[Whoopi Goldberg]], [[Cheech Marin]], and [[Jim Cummings]] providing supporting vocals; Cummings performed partial material for [[Scar (The Lion King)|Scar]] after Irons' voice gave out.\n\nThe song is also featured in the 1997 [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] musical ''[[The Lion King]]'', with [[John Vickery (actor)|John Vickery]], [[Kevin Cahoon]], [[Stanley Wayne Mathis]], and [[Tracy Nicole Chapman]] performing it in the original Broadway cast for the musical. [[Chiwetel Ejiofor]] performed an altered version of the song in the 2019 [[The Lion King (2019 film)|film adaptation]].\n\n==''The Lion King''==\nThe song is performed as a musical number by [[Scar (The Lion King)|Scar]], who lusts for the position as king of the Pride Lands. Scar is inspired to develop a plot for both his brother Mufasa and his nephew Simba to be murdered, and tells about this plan through song to a large army of [[spotted hyena]] minions by his pledge to spare the hungry animals from starvation if they provide him with assistance.\n\n====Production====\nOriginally, the song (first called \"Thanks to Me\") was about Scar introducing the hyenas to the lionesses after he pronounced himself king. This idea was eventually scrapped and replaced with ''Be Prepared''.{{citation needed|date=August 2019}} A reprise of the song after Mufasa's death was also cut from the film, but is featured in the [[The Lion King (musical)|musical version]].{{citation needed|date=August 2019}}\n\nIn the beginning of the second verse, an army of hyenas is shown [[Goose step|goose-stepping]] in front of Scar, who is perched on an overlooking cliff in resemblance of [[Adolf Hitler]] with upwards of 22 beams of light pointing straight-up (resembling the [[Cathedral of light]] featured in many of the [[Nuremberg Rallies]]). Shadows cast onto the cliff evoke for a brief second monumental columns. This is modeled after footage from the [[Leni Riefenstahl]]'s [[Nazi Germany|Nazi]] propaganda movie ''[[Triumph of the Will]]''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.businessinsider.com/the-lion-king-be-prepared-nazi-film-2014-6|title=The Darkest Song From 'The Lion King' Was Based On A 1935 Nazi Propaganda Film|last=Pallotta|first=Frank|website=Business Insider|access-date=2019-01-29}}</ref>\n\nThough [[Jeremy Irons]] is credited for performing the lead vocals on the song, at the 2012 [[Calgary Comic and Entertainment Expo]], [[Jim Cummings]], who also played Ed, stated that he sang most of the song, and that Irons only did some of the talking.<ref>{{cite web|title=Jim Cummings on Hakuna Matata and Be Prepared|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wmrdn9eFTK8&t=3m15s|date=3 May 2012}}</ref> However, footage from the film's recording sessions available on the film's 2017 Blu-ray release reveals that Irons sang the entire first verse of the song, while a cursory analysis of the recording suggests (due to a subtle but evident shift in vocal timbre heard in Scar's lead vocal) that Cummings only sang the final verse (\"So be prepared for the coup of the century...\") in the final cut of the film. Cummings has also confirmed this in other interviews, claiming that he sang this last verse due to Irons developing vocal problems during the recording session.<ref>https://www.huffingtonpost.com/jim-hill/lion-king-voice-actors_b_968140.html</ref>\n\n====Original recording====\nOn the original soundtrack recording, Scar opens the song with a [[soliloquy]]:\n\n{{cquote|I never thought hyenas essential. They're crude and unspeakably plain. But maybe they've a glimmer of potential if allied to my vision and brain.}}\n\nIn the film, this is cut and the song begins immediately. This was due to a plot adjustment.<ref>[http://www.lionking.org/scripts/Script.html#prepared TLK Script (HTML 3.0 Version)<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> The soliloquy had Scar considering using the hyenas for his plot, but in the final version of the story he had already used the hyenas in his plans before the song. The soliloquy is, however, included in the Broadway version.{{citation needed|date=August 2019}}\n\n===International versions===\nWhen the movie was first released in 1994, it numbered complexively 28 versions worldwide, including a special [[Zulu language|Zulu]] version made in [[South Africa]]. This is not just the only Zulu dubbing ever made by Disney, but also the only dubbing made in any [[Languages of Africa|African language]], other than [[Arabic]].<ref>{{Cite

film as it was considered too dark.]]\n\nDuring early production of the film, there was a reprise created of the song, taking place after Scar has assumed power over the Pride Lands. He is given the idea by Zazu to find a mate. So he tries seducing [[Nala (The Lion King)|Nala]], who refuses his advances, and is therefore banished by Scar. He then unleashes the hyenas upon the Pride Lands as his \"executive staff\". The reprise was ultimately removed from the film and the concept was later recycled in \"[[The Madness of King Scar]]\" was included in the Broadway musical version of the film.<ref>{{cite video|title=Scar Wants Nala as His Queen|author=Allers, Roger|authorlink=Roger Allers|location=The Lion King: Diamond Edition |type = Blu-ray |year=2011 |publisher=Walt Disney Home Entertainment}}</ref>\n\n==''The Lion King 1\u00bd''==\nIn [[DisneyToon Studios|DisneyToon]]'s 2004 direct-to-video film ''[[The Lion King 1\u00bd]]'', the music from the beginning of the song is briefly heard as [[Timon and Pumbaa]] tour Scar's lair as a possible new home, commenting on how it is quiet, secluded and with no uninvited visitors. The shadows of the goose-stepping hyena army are then seen marching in front of them, though they haven't started singing yet. Timon and Pumbaa stare at them for a few seconds, and remark that the hyenas \"ain't the traveling company of [[Riverdance]].\" They then riverdance out of the scene.\n\n==''The Lion King'' (2019)==\nOn February 3, 2019, Skyler Shuler of The DisInsider reported that \"Be Prepared\" would be one of the songs featured in the [[The Lion King (2019 film)|2019 remake of ''The Lion King'']], directed by [[Jon Favreau]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.broadwayworld.com/article/Be-Prepared-Will-Be-Featured-in-THE-LION-KING-Live-Action-Film-20190203|title='Be Prepared' Will Be Featured in THE LION KING Live Action Film|first=Stephanie|last=Wild|work=BroadwayWorld|date=February 3, 2019|accessdate=February 3, 2019}}</ref> <ref>{{cite web|url=https://ew.com/movies/2019/04/29/the-lion-king-scar/|title=The Lion King\u2019s Chiwetel Ejiofor on the diabolical psychology of Scar|first=Marc|last=Snetiker|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|date=April 29, 2019|accessdate=April 30, 2019}}</ref> On June 24, 2019, the remake was confirmed to feature a reworked version of the song.<ref name=\"Soundtrack\">{{cite web|url=http://collider.com/the-lion-king-soundtrack-details-new-song|title=\u2018The Lion King\u2019 Soundtrack Details Revealed; Includes New Elton John Song|first=Adam|last=Chitwood|work=[[Collider]]|date=June 24, 2019|accessdate=June 24, 2019}}</ref>\n\n==''The Lion King'' Broadway musical==\nAs in the original soundtrack recording, Scar begins the song with a brief soliloquy. The song is similar to its film counterpart in most respects, including the goose stepping hyenas, but there is a dance number performed by the hyena ensemble halfway through.  Scar later sings a brief [[reprise]] while declaring himself king at Mufasa's funeral in which he introduces the hyenas as his direct and privileged minions (the aforementioned deleted reprise from the film).  However, the Broadway reprise was not featured in the soundtrack, and is instead replaced with a sinister chord at the end of the song \"Rafiki Mourns\". In other soundtracks from different productions, the song is not represented at all.\n\n==''Festival of The Lion King''==\nIn [[Walt Disney World]]'s [[Disney's Animal Kingdom|Animal Kingdom]]'s ''[[Festival of the Lion King]]'', Kiume sings the song while the theater takes on a darker tone with the male dancers carrying spears and shields, while the female dancers dance with streamers. After Kiume sings the first verse, the solo hyena performer does a tribal dance with a fire torch. In the finale, when the snippet of \"Be Prepared\" is sung, the hyena comes back out but dances with blades.\n==Reception==\n===Original Version===\nThe song has garnered positive reaction and review. Becky Fuller from [[Screen Rant]] gave the song's original version a positive review. He describes the song as \"camp, fun, and just scary enough to make younger viewers feel a little on edge\" and perfectly summed up Scar's character. He praised Jeremy Irons' performance, citing his deep, dulcet tones is perfect for the song. <ref>{{cite web|url=https://screenrant.com/lion-king-2019-be-prepared-villain-song-bad/|title=The Lion King 2019 Gets All the Songs Right (Except Be Prepared)|first=Becky|last=Fuller|work=[[Screen Rant]]|date=July 21, 2019|accessdate=August 14, 2019}}</ref>\n[[Glen Weldon]] from [[NPR]] also praised the song as indelible and iconic for its pure expression of Scar's character.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/2019/07/17/742204352/lion-king-2019-be-prepared-villain-anthem-jeremy-irons-chiwetel-ejiofor|title=The Lion King Had the Perfect Villain Song, This Time Be Prepared for Less|first=Glen|last=Weldon|work=[[NPR]]|date=July 17, 2019|accessdate=August 14, 2019}}</ref> Hannah-Rose Yee from Stylist cited Be Prepared as one of the best songs in the film for mixing humor and tragedy in the lyrics that builds up the character's deluded aspiration and twisted desire.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.stylist.co.uk/life/lion-king-live-action-be-prepared-cut-elton-john-beyonce/271463|title=Lion King fans, beware: the live action movie has cut the film's best song|first=Hannah-Rose|last=Yee|work=Stylist|date=June 14, 2018|accessdate=August 14, 2019}}</ref>\n\n===2019 Remake===\nThe remake song received a mixed to negative reaction.

The house was constructed in the [[Palladian architecture|Palladian]] style for the [[Thomas Coke, 1st Earl of Leicester (fifth creation)|1st Earl of Leicester]] (fifth creation)<ref>[[Thomas Coke, 1st Earl of Leicester (fifth creation)]](1697\u20131759), the builder of Holkham, should not be confused with his great-nephew [[Thomas Coke, 1st Earl of Leicester (seventh creation)]] (1754\u20131842), the celebrated [[agrarianism|agrarian]] known as \"Coke of Norfolk\", who also lived at Holkham Hall. Thomas Coke, 1st Earl of Leicester (builder of Holkham), died without surviving sons, hence his Earldom terminated. Holkham subsequently passed to Thomas Coke's nephew [[Wenman Coke (died 1776)|Wenman Roberts]] who assumed the Coke surname but could not inherit the title. It was Roberts's son, Thomas Coke, born in 1754, for whom the title \"Earl of [[Leicester]], of Holkham in the County of Norfolk\", was created in 1837. The new title was an honour granted in recognition of Coke's services to politics and agriculture. As this [[earldom]] was of a new creation, he too became the 1st Earl. It is his descendant Thomas Coke, 8th Earl of [[Leicester]], who resides at Holkham today. The [[surname]] \"Coke\" is pronounced \"Cook\".</ref><ref name=\"A\">The Earldom of Leicester has been, to date, created seven times. Thomas Coke, the builder of Holkham, was the 1st Earl of the fifth creation. His grand nephew Thomas Coke was the 1st Earl of the seventh creation.</ref> by the architect [[William Kent]], aided by the architect and aristocrat [[Richard Boyle, 3rd Earl of Burlington|Lord Burlington]].\n\nHolkham Hall is one of England's finest examples of the Palladian revival style of architecture, and the severity of its design is closer to Palladio's ideals than many of the other numerous Palladian style houses of the period. The Holkham Estate was built up by Sir [[Edward Coke]], the founder of his family's fortune. He bought Neales manor in 1609, though never lived there, and made many other purchases of land in Norfolk to endow to his six sons. His fourth son, John, inherited the land and married heiress Meriel Wheatley in 1612. They made Hill Hall their home, and by 1659, John had complete ownership of all three Holkham manors. It is the ancestral home of the Coke family, who became [[Earl of Leicester|Earls of Leicester]].\n\nThe interior of the hall is opulent, but by the standards of the day, simply decorated and furnished. Ornament is used with such restraint that it was possible to decorate both private and state rooms in the same style, without oppressing the former.<ref>Nicolson, p.237</ref> The principal entrance is through the Marble Hall, which is in fact made of pink Derbyshire [[alabaster]]; this leads to the ''[[piano nobile]]'', or the first floor, and [[state room]]s. The most impressive of these rooms is the Saloon, which has walls lined with red velvet. Each of the major state rooms is symmetrical in its layout and design; in some rooms, false doors are necessary to fully achieve this balanced effect.\n\n==Architects and patron==\n[[File:Holkham Hall wing.jpg|thumb|Holkham Hall.

Coke Estates Ltd. Retrieved on 19 June 2008.</ref>\n\nAlthough [[Colen Campbell]] was employed by Thomas Coke in the early 1720s, the oldest existing working and construction plans for Holkham were drawn by [[Matthew Brettingham]], under the supervision of Thomas Coke, in 1726. These followed the guidelines and ideals for the house as defined by Kent and Burlington. The Palladian revival style chosen was at this time making its return in England. The style made a brief appearance in England before the [[English Civil War|Civil War]], when it was introduced by [[Inigo Jones]].<ref>Lees-Milne, James. \"The Age of Inigo Jones\". London: B. T. Batsford, 1953. 54\u201356.</ref> However, following the [[English Restoration|Restoration]] it was replaced in popular favour by the [[Baroque architecture|Baroque]] style. The \"Palladian revival\", popular in the 18th century, was loosely based on the appearance of the works of the 16th-century Italian architect [[Andrea Palladio]]. However it did not adhere to Palladio's strict rules of proportion. The style eventually evolved into what is generally referred to as [[Georgian architecture|Georgian]],<ref>Downs, Joseph. \"The Tower Hill Room\". ''Bulletin of the Pennsylvania Museum''. Volume 21, No. 96, October 1925. 4\u201311.</ref> still popular in England today. It was the chosen style for numerous houses in both town and country, although Holkham is exceptional for both its severity of design and for being closer than most in its adherence to Palladio's ideals.\n\nAlthough Thomas Coke oversaw the project, he delegated the on-site architectural duties to the local Norfolk architect Matthew Brettingham, who was employed as the on-site clerk of works. Brettingham was already the estate architect, and was in receipt of [[pound sterling|\u00a3]]50 a year (about {{formatnum:{{inflation|UK|50|1720|r=-3}}}} pounds per year in {{CURRENTYEAR}} terms{{inflation-fn|UK}}) in return for \"taking care of his Lordship's buildings\".<ref name=\"Colvin\">Colvin, H. M. \"A Biographical Dictionary of English Architects, 1660-1840\". Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 1954. 91.</ref> He was also influential in the design of the mansion, although he attributed the design of the Marble Hall to Coke himself. William Kent was mainly responsible for the interiors of the Southwest pavilion, or family wing block, particularly the Long Library. Kent produced a variety of alternative exteriors, suggesting a far richer decoration than Coke wanted. Brettingham described the building of Holkham as \"the great work of [my life]\", and when he published his \"The Plans and Elevations of the late Earl of Leicester's House at Holkham\", he immodestly described himself as sole architect, making no mention of Kent's involvement. However, in a later edition of the book, Brettingham's son admitted that \"the general idea was first struck out by the Earls of Leicester and Burlington, assisted by Mr. William Kent\".<ref name=\"Colvin\" />\n\nIn 1734, the first foundations were laid; however, building was to continue for thirty years, until the completion of the great house in 1764.<ref>Summerson, 204.</ref>\n\n==Design==\n[[File:Plan de Holkham Hall.JPG|thumb|right|350px|Simplified, unscaled plan of the ''[[piano nobile]]'' at Holkham, showing the four symmetrical wings at each corner of the principal block.

'L' Green State Bedroom; 'O' Chapel.]]\n\nThe Palladian style was admired by [[British Whig Party|Whigs]] such as Thomas Coke, who sought to identify themselves with the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] of antiquity. Kent was responsible for the external appearance of Holkham; he based his design on Palladio's unbuilt Villa Mocenigo,<ref name=\"Watkin\">Watkin, David. \"A History of Western Architecture\". Laurence King Publishing, 2005. 375. {{ISBN|1-85669-459-3}}</ref> as it appears in ''[[I Quattro Libri dell'Architettura]]'', but with modifications.\n\nThe plans for Holkham were of a large central block of two floors only, containing on the [[piano nobile]] level a series of symmetrically balanced [[state room]]s situated around two [[courtyard]]s. No hint of these courtyards is given externally; they are intended for lighting rather than recreation or architectural value. This great central block is flanked by four smaller, rectangular blocks, or wings,<ref name=\"Jones\">Jones, Nigel R. \"Architecture of England, Scotland and Wales\". Greenwood Press, 2005. 145. {{ISBN|0-313-31850-6}}</ref> and at each corners is linked to the main house not by long [[colonnade]]s\u2014as would have been the norm in Palladian architecture\u2014but by short two-storey wings of only one bay.<ref name=\"Wilson\"/>\n\n===Exterior===\nThe external appearance of Holkham can best be described as a huge [[Roman architecture|Roman]] [[palace]].<ref>Prior, Nick. \"Museums and Modernity: Art Galleries and the Making of Modern Culture\". Berg Publishers, 2002. 73. {{ISBN|1-85973-508-8}}</ref> However, as with most architectural designs, it is never quite that simple. Holkham is a Palladian house, and yet even by Palladian standards the external appearance is austere and devoid of [[ornament (architecture)|ornamentation]]. This can almost certainly be traced to Coke himself. The on-site, supervising architect, Matthew Brettingham, related that Coke required and demanded \"commodiousness\", which can be interpreted as comfort. Hence rooms that were adequately lit by one window, had only one, as a second might have improved the external appearance but could have made a room cold or draughty. As a result, the few windows on the piano nobile, although symmetrically placed and balanced, appear lost in a sea of brickwork; albeit these yellow bricks were cast as exact replicas of ancient Roman bricks expressly for Holkham. Above the windows of the piano nobile, where on a true Palladian structure the windows of a [[mezzanine (architecture)|mezzanine]] would be, there is nothing. The reason for this is the double height of the state rooms on the piano nobile; however, not even a blind window, such as those often seen in Palladio's own work, is permitted to alleviate the severity of the [[facade]]. On the ground floor, the [[rustication (architecture)|rusticated]] walls are pierced by small windows more reminiscent of a prison than a grand house. One architectural commentator, [[Nigel Nicolson]], has described the house as appearing as functional as a [[Prussia]]n riding school.<ref>Nicolson, 234.</ref>\n\nThe principal, or South fa\u00e7ade, is 344&nbsp;feet (104.9&nbsp;m) in length (from each of the flanking wings to the other), its austerity relieved on the piano nobile level only by a great six-[[column]]ed [[portico]]. Each end of the central block is terminated by a slight projection, containing a [[Venetian window]] surmounted by a single storey square tower and capped roof, similar to those employed by [[Inigo Jones]] at [[Wilton House]] nearly a century earlier.<ref>Turner, Jane. ''The dictionary of art''. Grove Publications, 1996. 225. {{ISBN|1-884446-00-0}}</ref> A near identical portico was designed by Inigo Jones and [[Isaac de Caus]] for the Palladian front at Wilton, but this was never executed.\n\nThe flanking wings contain service and secondary rooms\u2014the family wing to the south-west; the guest wing to the north-west; the chapel wing to the south-east; and the kitchen wing to the north-east.  Each wing's external appearance is identical: three bays, each separated from the other by a narrow recess in the elevation. Each bay is surmounted by an unadorned [[pediment]].

One of these wings, as at the later [[Kedleston Hall]], was a self-contained country house to accommodate the family when the state rooms and central block were not in use.\n\nThe one storey porch at the main north entrance was designed in the 1850s by [[Samuel Sanders Teulon]], although stylistically it is indistinguishable from the 18th-century building.\n\n===Interior===\n[[File:Marble Hall Holkham Hall.jpg|thumb|Marble Hall]]\n[[File:Green State Bedroom.jpg|thumb|upright|View of the Green State bedroom]]\n\nInside the house, the Palladian form reaches a height and grandeur seldom seen in any other house in England. It has, in fact, been described as \"The finest Palladian interior in England.\"<ref>Nicolson, p.230.</ref> The grandeur of the interior is obtained with an absence of excessive ornament, and reflects Kent's career-long taste for \"the eloquence of a plain surface\".<ref>Sicca, Cinzia Maria. \"On William Kent's Roman Sources\". ''Architectural History'', Volume 29, 1986. 134\u2013157.</ref> Work on the interiors ran from 1739 to 1773. The first habitable rooms were in the family wing and were in use from 1740, the Long Library being the first major interior completed in 1741. Among the last to be completed and entirely under Lady Leicester's supervision is the Chapel with its alabaster [[reredos]]. \n\nThe house is entered through the Marble Hall (though the chief building fabric is in fact pink [[Derbyshire]] [[alabaster]]), modelled by Kent on a Roman [[basilica]]. The room is over 50&nbsp;feet (15&nbsp;m) from floor to ceiling and is dominated by the broad white marble flight of steps leading to the surrounding gallery, or [[peristyle]]: here alabaster clad [[Ionic order|Ionic columns]] support the [[coffer]]ed, [[gilding|gilded]] ceiling, copied from a design by Inigo Jones, inspired by the [[Pantheon, Rome|Pantheon]] in [[Rome]]. The fluted columns are thought to be replicas of those in the [[Temple of Fortuna Virilis]], also in Rome. Around the hall are statues in niches; these are predominantly plaster copies of classical deities.\n\nThe hall's flight of steps lead to the piano nobile and state rooms. The grandest, the Saloon, is situated immediately behind the great portico, with its walls lined with patterned red caffoy (a mixture of wool, linen and silk) and a [[coffer]]ed, gilded ceiling.<ref>Summerson, 206.</ref> In this room hangs [[Peter Paul Rubens|Rubens]]'s ''Return from Egypt''. On his Grand Tour, the Earl acquired a collection of Roman copies of Greek and Roman sculpture which is contained in the extensive Statue Gallery, which runs the full length of the house north to south. \n\nThe North Dining Room, a cube room of 27&nbsp;feet (8.2&nbsp;m) contains an [[Axminster]] carpet that perfectly mirrors the pattern of the ceiling above. A bust of [[Aelius Verus]], set in a [[niche (architecture)|niche]] in the wall of this room, was found during the restoration at [[Nettuno]]. A classical [[apse]] gives the room an almost temple air. The apse in fact, contains concealed access to the labyrinth of corridors and narrow stairs that lead to the distant kitchens and service areas of the house. \n\nEach corner of the east side of the principal block contains a square salon lit by a huge Venetian window, one of them\u2014the Landscape Room\u2014hung with paintings by [[Claude Lorrain]] and [[Gaspar Poussin]]. All of the major state rooms have symmetrical walls, even where this involves matching real with false doors. The major rooms also have elaborate white and multi-coloured marble fireplaces, most with carvings and sculpture, mainly the work of Thomas Carter, though Joseph Pickford carved the fireplace in the Statue Gallery.<ref name=\"Hiskey\" />  Much of the furniture in the state rooms was also designed by William Kent, in a stately classicising baroque manner.\n\nSo restrained is the interior decoration of the state rooms, or in the words of [[James Lees-Milne]], \"chaste\", that the smaller, more intimate rooms in the family's private south-west wing were decorated in similar vein, without being overpowering. The Long Library running the full length of the wing still contains the collection of books acquired by Thomas Coke on his Grand Tour through Italy, where he saw for the first time the Palladian villas which were to inspire Holkham.<ref name=\"Wilson\"/>\n\nThe Green State bedroom is the principal bedroom; it is decorated with paintings and tapestries, including works by [[Paul Saunders]] and George Smith Bradshaw.<ref>\"[http://www.holkham.co.uk/html/thehall_07.html The Green State Bedroom] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120217164228/http://www.holkham.co.uk/html/thehall_07.html |date=17 February 2012 }}\".

It is located over half a mile to the south and on [[Cartesian coordinate system|axis]] with the centre of the house. An avenue of trees stretches over a mile south of the obelisk.

Above the main entrance to the house within the Marble Hall is this inscription:\n\n<blockquote>\nTHIS SEAT, on an open barren Estate<br />\nWas planned, planted, built, decorated.<br />\nAnd inhabited the middle of the XVIIIth Century<br />\nBy THO's COKE EARL of LEICESTER<ref>Benjamin, Clarke. \"The British Gazetteer, Political, Commercial, Ecclesiastical, and Historical.

As well as planting over a million trees on the estate Coke employed the architect [[Samuel Wyatt]] to design over a number of buildings,<ref>Martins, Susanna Wade. \"A Great Estate At Work: The Holkham Estate and its Inhabitants in the Nineteenth Century\". Cambridge University Press, 1980. 155. {{ISBN|0-521-22696-1}}</ref> including a series of farm buildings and farmhouses in a simplified neo-classical style and, in the 1780s, the new walled [[kitchen garden]]s covering {{convert|6|acre|m2}}. The gardens stand to the west of the lake and include: A fig house, a peach house, a vinery, and other greenhouses. Wyatt's designs culminated in c. 1790 with the Great Barn, located in the park half a mile south-east of the obelisk. The cost of each farm was in the region of [[pound sterling|\u00a3]]1,500 to [[pound sterling|\u00a3]]2,600: Lodge Farm, [[Castle Acre]], cost [[pound sterling|\u00a3]]2,604 6s. 5d. in 1797\u20131800. The lake to the west of the house, originally a marshy inlet or [[Creek (tidal)|creek]] off the [[North Sea]], was created in 1801\u20131803 by the landscape gardener William Eames.\n\nAfter his death, Coke was commemorated by the Leicester Monument, designed by [[William Donthorne]] and erected in 1845\u20131848<ref>Hassall, W. O. \"Ilexes at Holkham\". Garden History, Volume 6, No. 1, 1978. 58\u201360.</ref> at a cost to the tenants of the estate of [[pound sterling|\u00a3]]4,000. The monument consists of a Corinthian column {{convert|120|ft|m}} high, surmounted by a drum supporting a wheatsheaf and a plinth decorated with bas-reliefs carved by John Henning, Jr. The corners of the plinth support sculptures of an ox, sheep, plough and seed-drill. Coke's work to increase farm yields had resulted in the rental income of the estate rising between 1776 and 1816 from [[pound sterling|\u00a3]]2,200 to [[pound sterling|\u00a3]]20,000, and had considerable influence on agricultural methods in Britain.\n\nIn 1850, [[Thomas Coke, 2nd Earl of Leicester]], called in the architect [[William Burn]] to build new stables to the east of the house, in collaboration with [[W. A. Nesfield]], who had designed the [[parterre]]s. Work started at the same time on the terraces surrounding the house. This work continued until 1857 and included, to the south and on axis with the house, the monumental fountain of [[Saint George and the Dragon]] dated c. 1849\u201357 sculpted by Charles Raymond Smith. To the east of the house and overlooking the terrace, Burn designed the large stone [[orangery]], with a three-bay pedimented centre and three-bay flanking wings. The orangery is now roofless and windowless.\n\n==Holkham today==\n\nThe cost of the construction of Holkham is thought to have been in the region of [[pound sterling|\u00a3]]90,000.<ref>Dickinson, H.

Thomas Coke, 1st Earl of Leicester (builder of Holkham), died without surviving sons, hence his Earldom terminated. Holkham subsequently passed to Thomas Coke's nephew [[Wenman Coke (died 1776)|Wenman Roberts]] who assumed the Coke surname but could not inherit the title. It was Roberts's son, Thomas Coke, born in 1754, for whom the title \"Earl of [[Leicester]], of Holkham in the County of Norfolk\", was created in 1837. The new title was an honour granted in recognition of Coke's services to politics and agriculture. As this [[earldom]] was of a new creation, he too became the 1st Earl. It is his descendant Thomas Coke, 8th Earl of [[Leicester]], who resides at Holkham today. The [[surname]] \"Coke\" is pronounced \"Cook\".</ref><ref name=\"A\">The Earldom of Leicester has been, to date, created seven times. Thomas Coke, the builder of Holkham, was the 1st Earl of the fifth creation. His grand nephew Thomas Coke was the 1st Earl of the seventh creation.</ref> by the architect [[William Kent]], aided by the architect and aristocrat [[Richard Boyle, 3rd Earl of Burlington|Lord Burlington]].\n\nHolkham Hall is one of England's finest examples of the Palladian revival style of architecture, and the severity of its design is closer to Palladio's ideals than many of the other numerous Palladian style houses of the period. The Holkham Estate was built up by Sir [[Edward Coke]], the founder of his family's fortune. He bought Neales manor in 1609, though never lived there, and made many other purchases of land in Norfolk to endow to his six sons. His fourth son, John, inherited the land and married heiress Meriel Wheatley in 1612. They made Hill Hall their home, and by 1659, John had complete ownership of all three Holkham manors. It is the ancestral home of the Coke family, who became [[Earl of Leicester|Earls of Leicester]].\n\nThe interior of the hall is opulent, but by the standards of the day, simply decorated and furnished. Ornament is used with such restraint that it was possible to decorate both private and state rooms in the same style, without oppressing the former.<ref>Nicolson, p.237</ref> The principal entrance is through the Marble Hall, which is in fact made of pink Derbyshire alabaster; this leads to the ''[[piano nobile]]'', or the first floor, and [[state room]]s. The most impressive of these rooms is the Saloon, which has walls lined with red velvet. Each of the major state rooms is symmetrical in its layout and design; in some rooms, false doors are necessary to fully achieve this balanced effect.\n\n==Architects and patron==\n[[File:Holkham Hall wing.jpg|thumb|Holkham Hall.

Retrieved on 19 June 2008.</ref>\n\nAlthough [[Colen Campbell]] was employed by Thomas Coke in the early 1720s, the oldest existing working and construction plans for Holkham were drawn by [[Matthew Brettingham]], under the supervision of Thomas Coke, in 1726. These followed the guidelines and ideals for the house as defined by Kent and Burlington. The Palladian revival style chosen was at this time making its return in England. The style made a brief appearance in England before the [[English Civil War|Civil War]], when it was introduced by [[Inigo Jones]].<ref>Lees-Milne, James. \"The Age of Inigo Jones\". London: B. T. Batsford, 1953. 54\u201356.</ref> However, following the [[English Restoration|Restoration]] it was replaced in popular favour by the [[Baroque architecture|Baroque]] style. The \"Palladian revival\", popular in the 18th century, was loosely based on the appearance of the works of the 16th-century Italian architect [[Andrea Palladio]]. However it did not adhere to Palladio's strict rules of proportion. The style eventually evolved into what is generally referred to as [[Georgian architecture|Georgian]],<ref>Downs, Joseph. \"The Tower Hill Room\". ''Bulletin of the Pennsylvania Museum''. Volume 21, No. 96, October 1925. 4\u201311.</ref> still popular in England today. It was the chosen style for numerous houses in both town and country, although Holkham is exceptional for both its severity of design and for being closer than most in its adherence to Palladio's ideals.\n\nAlthough Thomas Coke oversaw the project, he delegated the on-site architectural duties to the local Norfolk architect Matthew Brettingham, who was employed as the on-site clerk of works. Brettingham was already the estate architect, and was in receipt of [[pound sterling|\u00a3]]50 a year (about {{formatnum:{{inflation|UK|50|1720|r=-3}}}} pounds per year in {{CURRENTYEAR}} terms{{inflation-fn|UK}}) in return for \"taking care of his Lordship's buildings\".<ref name=\"Colvin\">Colvin, H. M. \"A Biographical Dictionary of English Architects, 1660-1840\". Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 1954. 91.</ref> He was also influential in the design of the mansion, although he attributed the design of the Marble Hall to Coke himself. William Kent was mainly responsible for the interiors of the Southwest pavilion, or family wing block, particularly the Long Library. Kent produced a variety of alternative exteriors, suggesting a far richer decoration than Coke wanted. Brettingham described the building of Holkham as \"the great work of [my life]\", and when he published his \"The Plans and Elevations of the late Earl of Leicester's House at Holkham\", he immodestly described himself as sole architect, making no mention of Kent's involvement. However, in a later edition of the book, Brettingham's son admitted that \"the general idea was first struck out by the Earls of Leicester and Burlington, assisted by Mr. William Kent\".<ref name=\"Colvin\" />\n\nIn 1734, the first foundations were laid; however, building was to continue for thirty years, until the completion of the great house in 1764.<ref>Summerson, 204.</ref>\n\n==Design==\n[[File:Plan de Holkham Hall.JPG|thumb|right|350px|Simplified, unscaled plan of the ''[[piano nobile]]'' at Holkham, showing the four symmetrical wings at each corner of the principal block.

'L' Green State Bedroom; 'O' Chapel.]]\n\nThe Palladian style was admired by [[British Whig Party|Whigs]] such as Thomas Coke, who sought to identify themselves with the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] of antiquity. Kent was responsible for the external appearance of Holkham; he based his design on Palladio's unbuilt Villa Mocenigo,<ref name=\"Watkin\">Watkin, David. \"A History of Western Architecture\". Laurence King Publishing, 2005. 375. {{ISBN|1-85669-459-3}}</ref> as it appears in ''[[I Quattro Libri dell'Architettura]]'', but with modifications.\n\nThe plans for Holkham were of a large central block of two floors only, containing on the [[piano nobile]] level a series of symmetrically balanced [[state room]]s situated around two [[courtyard]]s. No hint of these courtyards is given externally; they are intended for lighting rather than recreation or architectural value. This great central block is flanked by four smaller, rectangular blocks, or wings,<ref name=\"Jones\">Jones, Nigel R. \"Architecture of England, Scotland and Wales\". Greenwood Press, 2005. 145. {{ISBN|0-313-31850-6}}</ref> and at each corners is linked to the main house not by long [[colonnade]]s\u2014as would have been the norm in Palladian architecture\u2014but by short two-storey wings of only one bay.<ref name=\"Wilson\"/>\n\n===Exterior===\nThe external appearance of Holkham can best be described as a huge [[Roman architecture|Roman]] [[palace]].<ref>Prior, Nick. \"Museums and Modernity: Art Galleries and the Making of Modern Culture\". Berg Publishers, 2002. 73. {{ISBN|1-85973-508-8}}</ref> However, as with most architectural designs, it is never quite that simple. Holkham is a Palladian house, and yet even by Palladian standards the external appearance is austere and devoid of [[ornament (architecture)|ornamentation]]. This can almost certainly be traced to Coke himself. The on-site, supervising architect, Matthew Brettingham, related that Coke required and demanded \"commodiousness\", which can be interpreted as comfort. Hence rooms that were adequately lit by one window, had only one, as a second might have improved the external appearance but could have made a room cold or draughty. As a result, the few windows on the piano nobile, although symmetrically placed and balanced, appear lost in a sea of brickwork; albeit these yellow bricks were cast as exact replicas of ancient Roman bricks expressly for Holkham. Above the windows of the piano nobile, where on a true Palladian structure the windows of a [[mezzanine (architecture)|mezzanine]] would be, there is nothing. The reason for this is the double height of the state rooms on the piano nobile; however, not even a blind window, such as those often seen in Palladio's own work, is permitted to alleviate the severity of the [[facade]]. On the ground floor, the [[rustication (architecture)|rusticated]] walls are pierced by small windows more reminiscent of a prison than a grand house. One architectural commentator, [[Nigel Nicolson]], has described the house as appearing as functional as a [[Prussia]]n riding school.<ref>Nicolson, 234.</ref>\n\nThe principal, or South fa\u00e7ade, is 344&nbsp;feet (104.9&nbsp;m) in length (from each of the flanking wings to the other), its austerity relieved on the piano nobile level only by a great six-[[column]]ed [[portico]]. Each end of the central block is terminated by a slight projection, containing a [[Venetian window]] surmounted by a single storey square tower and capped roof, similar to those employed by [[Inigo Jones]] at [[Wilton House]] nearly a century earlier.<ref>Turner, Jane. ''The dictionary of art''. Grove Publications, 1996. 225. {{ISBN|1-884446-00-0}}</ref> A near identical portico was designed by Inigo Jones and [[Isaac de Caus]] for the Palladian front at Wilton, but this was never executed.\n\nThe flanking wings contain service and secondary rooms\u2014the family wing to the south-west; the guest wing to the north-west; the chapel wing to the south-east; and the kitchen wing to the north-east.  Each wing's external appearance is identical: three bays, each separated from the other by a narrow recess in the elevation. Each bay is surmounted by an unadorned [[pediment]]. The composition of stone, recesses, varying pediments and chimneys of the four blocks is almost reminiscent of the [[English Baroque]] style in favour ten years earlier, employed at [[Seaton Delaval Hall]]<ref>\"[https://web.archive.org/web/20090201143510/http://sitwell.co.uk/john_piper.htm John Piper]\". Renishaw Hall. Retrieved on 2 March 2014.</ref> by Sir [[John Vanbrugh]]. One of these wings, as at the later [[Kedleston Hall]], was a self-contained country house to accommodate the family when the state rooms and central block were not in use.\n\nThe one storey porch at the main north entrance was designed in the 1850s by [[Samuel Sanders Teulon]], although stylistically it is indistinguishable from the 18th-century building.\n\n===Interior===\n[[File:Marble Hall Holkham Hall.jpg|thumb|Marble Hall]]\n[[File:Green State Bedroom.jpg|thumb|upright|View of the Green State bedroom]]\n\nInside the house, the Palladian form reaches a height and grandeur seldom seen in any other house in England. It has, in fact, been described as \"The finest Palladian interior in England.\"<ref>Nicolson, p.230.</ref> The grandeur of the interior is obtained with an absence of excessive ornament, and reflects Kent's career-long taste for \"the eloquence of a plain surface\".<ref>Sicca, Cinzia Maria. \"On William Kent's Roman Sources\". ''Architectural History'', Volume 29, 1986. 134\u2013157.</ref> Work on the interiors ran from 1739 to 1773. The first habitable rooms were in the family wing and were in use from 1740, the Long Library being the first major interior completed in 1741. Among the last to be completed and entirely under Lady Leicester's supervision is the Chapel with its alabaster [[reredos]]. \n\nThe house is entered through the Marble Hall (though the chief building fabric is in fact pink [[Derbyshire]] [[alabaster]]), modelled by Kent on a Roman [[basilica]]. The room is over 50&nbsp;feet (15&nbsp;m) from floor to ceiling and is dominated by the broad white marble flight of steps leading to the surrounding gallery, or [[peristyle]]: here alabaster clad [[Ionic order|Ionic columns]] support the [[coffer]]ed, [[gilding|gilded]] ceiling, copied from a design by Inigo Jones, inspired by the [[Pantheon, Rome|Pantheon]] in [[Rome]]. The fluted columns are thought to be replicas of those in the [[Temple of Fortuna Virilis]], also in Rome. Around the hall are statues in niches; these are predominantly plaster copies of classical deities.\n\nThe hall's flight of steps lead to the piano nobile and state rooms. The grandest, the Saloon, is situated immediately behind the great portico, with its walls lined with patterned red caffoy (a mixture of wool, linen and silk) and a [[coffer]]ed, gilded ceiling.<ref>Summerson, 206.</ref> In this room hangs [[Peter Paul Rubens|Rubens]]'s ''Return from Egypt''. On his Grand Tour, the Earl acquired a collection of Roman copies of Greek and Roman sculpture which is contained in the extensive Statue Gallery, which runs the full length of the house north to south. \n\nThe North Dining Room, a cube room of 27&nbsp;feet (8.2&nbsp;m) contains an [[Axminster]] carpet that perfectly mirrors the pattern of the ceiling above. A bust of [[Aelius Verus]], set in a [[niche (architecture)|niche]] in the wall of this room, was found during the restoration at [[Nettuno]]. A classical [[apse]] gives the room an almost temple air. The apse in fact, contains concealed access to the labyrinth of corridors and narrow stairs that lead to the distant kitchens and service areas of the house. \n\nEach corner of the east side of the principal block contains a square salon lit by a huge Venetian window, one of them\u2014the Landscape Room\u2014hung with paintings by [[Claude Lorrain]] and [[Gaspar Poussin]]. All of the major state rooms have symmetrical walls, even where this involves matching real with false doors. The major rooms also have elaborate white and multi-coloured marble fireplaces, most with carvings and sculpture, mainly the work of Thomas Carter, though Joseph Pickford carved the fireplace in the Statue Gallery.<ref name=\"Hiskey\" />  Much of the furniture in the state rooms was also designed by William Kent, in a stately classicising baroque manner.\n\nSo restrained is the interior decoration of the state rooms, or in the words of [[James Lees-Milne]], \"chaste\", that the smaller, more intimate rooms in the family's private south-west wing were decorated in similar vein, without being overpowering. The Long Library running the full length of the wing still contains the collection of books acquired by Thomas Coke on his Grand Tour through Italy, where he saw for the first time the Palladian villas which were to inspire Holkham.<ref name=\"Wilson\"/>\n\nThe Green State bedroom is the principal bedroom; it is decorated with paintings and tapestries, including works by [[Paul Saunders]] and George Smith Bradshaw.<ref>\"[http://www.holkham.co.uk/html/thehall_07.html The Green State Bedroom] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120217164228/http://www.holkham.co.uk/html/thehall_07.html |date=17 February 2012 }}\".

This event was commemorated by the construction in 1730 of the [[obelisk]],<ref name=\"Hiskey\" /> {{convert|80|ft|m}} in height, standing on the highest point in the park. It is located over half a mile to the south and on [[Cartesian coordinate system|axis]] with the centre of the house. An avenue of trees stretches over a mile south of the obelisk. Thousands of trees were planted on what had been windswept land; by 1770 the park covered {{convert|1500|acre|km2}}. \n\nOther garden buildings designed by Kent are, near the far end of the avenue the Triumphal Arch, designed in 1739 but only completed in 1752 and the domed [[Doric order|doric]] temple (1730\u20131735) in the woods near the obelisk. Above the main entrance to the house within the Marble Hall is this inscription:\n\n<blockquote>\nTHIS SEAT, on an open barren Estate<br />\nWas planned, planted, built, decorated.<br />\nAnd inhabited the middle of the XVIIIth Century<br />\nBy THO's COKE EARL of LEICESTER<ref>Benjamin, Clarke. \"The British Gazetteer, Political, Commercial, Ecclesiastical, and Historical. Illustrated by a Full Set of Accurately Laid Down County Maps with All the Railways\".  H. G. Collins, 1852.  488.</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nUnder [[Thomas Coke, 1st Earl of Leicester (seventh creation)|Coke of Norfolk]], the great-nephew and heir of the builder, extensive improvements were made to the park and by his death in 1842 it had grown to its present extent of over {{convert|3000|acre|km2}}. As well as planting over a million trees on the estate Coke employed the architect [[Samuel Wyatt]] to design over a number of buildings,<ref>Martins, Susanna Wade. \"A Great Estate At Work: The Holkham Estate and its Inhabitants in the Nineteenth Century\". Cambridge University Press, 1980. 155. {{ISBN|0-521-22696-1}}</ref> including a series of farm buildings and farmhouses in a simplified neo-classical style and, in the 1780s, the new walled [[kitchen garden]]s covering {{convert|6|acre|m2}}. The gardens stand to the west of the lake and include: A fig house, a peach house, a vinery, and other greenhouses. Wyatt's designs culminated in c. 1790 with the Great Barn, located in the park half a mile south-east of the obelisk. The cost of each farm was in the region of [[pound sterling|\u00a3]]1,500 to [[pound sterling|\u00a3]]2,600: Lodge Farm, [[Castle Acre]], cost [[pound sterling|\u00a3]]2,604 6s. 5d. in 1797\u20131800. The lake to the west of the house, originally a marshy inlet or [[Creek (tidal)|creek]] off the [[North Sea]], was created in 1801\u20131803 by the landscape gardener William Eames.\n\nAfter his death, Coke was commemorated by the Leicester Monument, designed by [[William Donthorne]] and erected in 1845\u20131848<ref>Hassall, W. O. \"Ilexes at Holkham\". Garden History, Volume 6, No. 1, 1978. 58\u201360.</ref> at a cost to the tenants of the estate of [[pound sterling|\u00a3]]4,000. The monument consists of a Corinthian column {{convert|120|ft|m}} high, surmounted by a drum supporting a wheatsheaf and a plinth decorated with bas-reliefs carved by John Henning, Jr. The corners of the plinth support sculptures of an ox, sheep, plough and seed-drill. Coke's work to increase farm yields had resulted in the rental income of the estate rising between 1776 and 1816 from [[pound sterling|\u00a3]]2,200 to [[pound sterling|\u00a3]]20,000, and had considerable influence on agricultural methods in Britain.\n\nIn 1850, [[Thomas Coke, 2nd Earl of Leicester]], called in the architect [[William Burn]] to build new stables to the east of the house, in collaboration with [[W. A. Nesfield]], who had designed the [[parterre]]s. Work started at the same time on the terraces surrounding the house. This work continued until 1857 and included, to the south and on axis with the house, the monumental fountain of [[Saint George and the Dragon]] dated c. 1849\u201357 sculpted by Charles Raymond Smith. To the east of the house and overlooking the terrace, Burn designed the large stone [[orangery]], with a three-bay pedimented centre and three-bay flanking wings. The orangery is now roofless and windowless.\n\n==Holkham today==\n\nThe cost of the construction of Holkham is thought to have been in the region of [[pound sterling|\u00a3]]90,000.<ref>Dickinson, H. T. \"A Companion to Eighteenth-century Britain\". WileyBlackwell, 2002. 321.</ref> This vast cost nearly ruined the heirs of the 1st Earl, but had the result that they were financially unable to alter the house to suit the whims of taste. Thus, the house has remained almost untouched since its completion in 1764. Today, this perfect, if severe, example of Palladianism is at the heart of a thriving private estate of some {{convert|25000|acre|km2}}.<ref name=\"BBC\" /> Though open to the public on Sundays, Mondays and Thursdays, it is still the family home of the [[Earl of Leicester|Earls of Leicester]] of Holkham.<ref>\"A Microcosm of Old England\".
