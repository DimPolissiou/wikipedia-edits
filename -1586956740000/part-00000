Other iOS similarities include the app icons being in a uniform shape, the dialer and in-call interface, the organization of the Settings app, and the visual appearance of toggles in the UI. This prompted some observers to cite how the devices running on MIUI could appeal to iOS users wanting to switch to the Android platform.<ref name=\":0\" /> By 2018, MIUI was increasingly shifting towards a design aesthetic more similar to the stock Android. For instance, several elements in the MIUI 10 build resemble [[Android Pie]] features such as the multitasking menu and gesture controls.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.androidheadlines.com/2018/05/miui-10-to-offer-updated-design-its-user-interface-leaks.html|title=MIUI 10 To Offer Updated Design, Its User Interface Leaks {{!}} Androidheadlines.com|date=2018-05-29|work=AndroidHeadlines.com {{!}}|access-date=2018-07-31|language=en-US}}</ref> This change was first seen in the MIUI 9 (ver. 8.5.11) that shipped with the [[Xiaomi Mi MIX 2S|Xiaomi Mi Mix 2S]].

Methods of removing it were published in the MIUI's Chinese forum, since the engine was not found to be helpful.\n\nAlso during the development of MIUI V4, Xiaomi started to remove [[Google Mobile Services]] (GMS) from their ROMs because of Chinese government policies that arose in response to Google's disagreements with the Chinese government. The government blocked access to all Google services on every platform in mainland China; phones made for the Chinese market are required not to allow the installation of GMS. GMS is supported in the global variant of MIUI, however.{{Citation needed|date=December 2019}}\n\nIn order to raise funds for the company, MIUI has its own online services from Xiaomi, including cloud services, paid themes and games (featuring the MiCredit digital currency).<ref>{{cite web|title=\u5220\u9664\u8c37\u6b4c\uff0c\u5185\u7f6e\u6740\u6bd2\uff0cMIUI\u7ec8\u4e8e\u7a81\u7834\u5e95\u7ebf|url=http://www.miui.com/thread-534432-1-1.html}}</ref> <!-- \"more reliable\" refs to news sites please?

Other iOS similarities include the app icons being in a uniform shape, the dialer and in-call interface, the organization of the Settings app, and the visual appearance of toggles in the UI.

Methods of removing it were published in the MIUI's Chinese forum, since the engine was not found to be helpful.\n\nAlso during the development of MIUI V4, Xiaomi started to remove [[Google Mobile Services]] (GMS) from their ROMs because of Chinese government policies that arose in response to Google's disagreements with the Chinese government. The government blocked access to all Google services on every platform in mainland China; phones made for the Chinese market are required not to allow the installation of GMS. GMS is supported in the global variant of MIUI, however.{{Citation needed|date=December 2019}}\n\nIn order to raise funds for the company, MIUI has its own online services from Xiaomi, including cloud services, paid themes and games (featuring the MiCredit digital currency).<ref>{{cite web|title=\u5220\u9664\u8c37\u6b4c\uff0c\u5185\u7f6e\u6740\u6bd2\uff0cMIUI\u7ec8\u4e8e\u7a81\u7834\u5e95\u7ebf|url=http://www.miui.com/thread-534432-1-1.html}}</ref> <!-- \"more reliable\" refs to news sites please?
