They currently play in the [[Scottish Championship]]. The Club was founded in 1878 and plays home matches at [[Gayfield Park]]. They play in maroon strips and are nicknamed \"The Red Lichties\" due to the red light that used to guide fishing boats back from the North Sea to the [[Burgh]]'s harbour. The Red Lichties share a long-standing and fierce rivalry with local neighbours [[Montrose F.C.|Montrose]].\n\n==History==\n\n===Record score===\n{{main|Arbroath 36\u20130 Bon Accord}}\nThe Red Lichties most notable and lasting accomplishment is to hold the world record for the [[Arbroath 36 Bon Accord 0|biggest victory in World senior football]], set on 12 September 1885 when they beat [[Bon Accord F.C.|Bon Accord]] 36\u20130 in a [[Scottish Cup]] match, with a further five to seven goals disallowed for offside.<ref name=\"fourtyone\">{{cite web|author=Will Springer |year=2005 |url=http://heritage.scotsman.com/traditions.cfm?id=2372812005 |title=A day when Scottish football scorched the record books |work=The Scotsman |accessdate=9 December 2005 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20071125173220/http://heritage.scotsman.com/traditions.cfm?id=2372812005 |archivedate=25 November 2007 }}</ref><ref name=\"fourtythree\">{{cite web|publisher=Arbroath F.C. |year=2003 |url=http://www.arbroathfc.co.uk/history/36-0-team.htm |title=The 36\u20130 team |author=Fraser Clyne |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070808184847/http://www.arbroathfc.co.uk/history/36-0-team.htm |archivedate=8 August 2007 |df=dmy }}</ref> [[Jocky Petrie (footballer)|Jocky Petrie]] scored 13 goals in that game, a record for the most goals by a single player in a British senior match.\n\n===Recent history===\nThe Red Lichties have had mixed success in recent years. In the [[1996\u201397 in Scottish football|1996\u201397]] season they hit the bottom of Scottish senior football as they finished last in the [[Scottish Football League Third Division|Third Division]]. However, the following season they were promoted back to the [[Scottish Football League Second Division|Second Division]]. They spent three years at this level before winning promotion to the [[Scottish Football League First Division|First Division]]. They finished 7th in their first season in the [[Scottish Football League First Division|First Division]], 13 points clear of relegation troubles. However, in the [[2002\u201303 in Scottish football|2002\u201303]] season, the Red Lichties struggled badly, and finished bottom of the table, 20 points adrift of penultimate side [[Alloa Athletic F.C.|Alloa Athletic]]. In the [[2003\u201304 in Scottish football|2003\u201304]] season, the Red Lichties narrowly avoided back-to-back relegations, as they escaped the drop on the last day of the season. In [[2004\u201305 in Scottish football|2004\u201305]], however, there was no escaping a 3\u20130 defeat at [[Dumbarton F.C.|Dumbarton]] on 30 April 2005, which consigned the Red Lichties to the Third Division for the following season.\nThe club rose from the depths of the [[Scottish Football League Third Division|Third Division]] to the heights of the [[Scottish Football League First Division|First Division]], then fell back down to the basement league in the next few seasons. However, under manager [[John McGlashan (footballer)|John McGlashan]], the Red Lichties competed at the top of Division 3, finishing 4th in their first season and second in the next, reaching both divisional play-offs in seasons 2005\u201306 and 2006\u201307, although failing to gain promotion. They finished fourth in Division 3 and disposed of Cowdenbeath 2\u20131 on aggregate thanks to a late extra time winner from Robbie Raeside in the semifinal. Stranraer were the opponents in the play-off final and the Red Lichties ran out 2\u20130 winners in the home tie first leg at Gayfield Park thanks to a Robbie Raeside header and a Barry Sellars strike. At Stranraer, the Red Lichties goal was pummelled for much of the match and they spent much of the second half down to 10 men after Craig Tully had been red-carded. Although one goal was conceded, a resolute defence saw the Red Lichties hold on for a 2\u20131 aggregate win and promotion.\n\nThe Red Lichties managed to consolidate their position in Division 2 in 2008\u201309. The season had started well but a narrow defeat in the Scottish League Cup at Gayfield Park on penalties to Scottish Premiership side Inverness Caledonian Thistle FC, triggered a sequence of losses and the club found themselves in the bottom half of the table. The performances were boosted by loan additions such as Steven Doris, Craig Forsyth, ex-Scotland international Colin Cameron and they got results when it mattered. Safety was all but assured with a narrow 1\u20130 win over Queens Park at Hampden Park, courtesy of a fine Robbie Ross strike and a 2\u20130 victory over Stranraer at Gayfield Park with goals from Ross and Forsyth. A 2\u20132 draw against Peterhead and a 0\u20130 draw against Raith Rovers in May was enough to seal 7th spot.\n\nDuring season 2009\u201310, results seemed to go into freefall after a 6\u20130 home defeat to St Johnstone in the Scottish League Cup early in the season. John McGlashan resigned to be replaced by Jim Weir who after a mixed start eventually rallied the Red Lichties to a spirited last few weeks of the season. With a win needed against East Fife to avoid the play-offs, the side threw everything they had in the last 20 minutes to find a winner but to no avail. After beating Queens Park in the play-off semifinal, their season ended with a 2\u20130 loss to Forfar Athletic in the final. Weir resigned to take up the vacant position at Brechin City and was replaced, on 27 May, by Paul Sheerin.\n\nOn 23 April 2011, the Red Lichties defeated local rivals [[Montrose F.C.|Montrose]] 4\u20131 to win the [[2010\u201311 in Scottish football|2010\u201311]] [[Scottish Football League Third Division|Third Division]] title; securing the club's first senior honours in their 133-year history and a return to [[Scottish Football League Second Division|Second Division]] at their first attempt.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/scot_div_1/9465306.stm|title=Arbroath 4\u20131 Montrose|date=23 April 2011|work=BBC Sport|accessdate=16 May 2011}}</ref> The next few seasons in the third tier (renamed League One) were mixed. A tremendous first season playing lively attacking football saw them run champions Cowdenbeath closely, more than matching them in head-to-head encounters but lacking the professional edge to grind out other results and losing the final three. The Red Lichties finished on 60 points and went out in the playoff semifinal. In 2012\u201313, a fairly mediocre season saw them end up in 5th spot, on 52 points just pipped for the final playoff spot. One highlight was a 3rd Round Scottish Cup tie at Celtic Park, drawing 1\u20131 and then exiting in the replay after an equaliser was controversially ruled out.\n\nSeason 2013\u201314 was disastrous. After an average start, a run of 14 games without a win saw the Red Lichties end up bottom of the pile on 31 points and automatically relegated. The attack-minded and purist emphasis of manager Sheerin, who continued as player-manager, meant most fans stayed supportive. Some poor signings were costly. The Red Lichties thus experienced their fourth relegation in 11 years. Sheerin left Gayfield Park in June 2014 to take up a post with the Under-20 side at Aberdeen. Allan Moore was subsequently appointed with Todd Lumsden as assistant. On Sunday, 12 April 2015, after a string of poor results in which the side only won once in 16 games, Moore was relieved of his duties as Manager and Lumsden took the helm. The team had been sitting at the top of the table by eight points in December but ended up finishing third and subsequently lost 3\u20132 on aggregate to Queens Park in the Play Off Semifinal.\n\nThe team performed poorly under the management of Todd Lumsden in season 2015\u201316 which was reflected by a lowly league position. With relegation into the Highland League a real threat, Lumsden was sacked in March 2016. Dick Campbell was then appointed and was able to steer the team to safety, finishing 9th and ahead of East Stirlingshire who were subsequently relegated after losing the play off to Lowland League champions Edinburgh City.\n\nThe 2016\u201317 season saw a massive turnaround under the helm of Campbell. They spent much of the season in second place behind Forfar Athletic and in early February were 11 points behind their Angus neighbours after a 1\u20130 defeat by the Loons at Gayfield Park. The Red Lichties however clawed that difference back and after the penultimate game of the season's 3\u20132 win against Elgin City, found themselves a point ahead at the top of the table with an away match against Stirling Albion remaining. An astonishing 1200 fans travelled to Forthbank to witness a 1\u20131 draw but with Forfar unexpectedly losing at home to Annan 4\u20132, the title was secured.\n\nThe [[2018\u201319 Scottish League One|2018\u201319]] season saw Arbroath line-up alongside the three other Angus sides in the same League for the first time. Despite having to compete with full-time [[Raith Rovers F.C.|Raith Rovers]], the club led from the opening day to win a second promotion in three years and a first league title win in the third tier. The Championship was secured on 13 April with a 1\u20131 draw at local rivals Brechin.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.thecourier.co.uk/fp/sport/football/scottish-league-1/869860/brechin-1-arbroath-1-red-lichties-secure-title-glory-and-promotion-to-the-championship/|title=Brechin 1 Arbroath 1: Red Lichties secure title glory and promotion to the Championship|date=13 April 2019|work=The Courier|accessdate=14 April 2019}}</ref>\n\nReturning to the second tier for the first time since being relegated in the 2002-03 season, Arbroath were never in any real danger of an immediate return to League One and spent most of the season on the fringe of the promotion playoff positions. Highlights of the season included two victories against [[Inverness Caledonian Thistle F.C.|Inverness Caledonian Thistle]] and a 1-0 win against [[Dundee United F.C.|Dundee United]], which made Arbroath the only side to defeat the eventual champions at [[Tannadice Park|Tannadice]] in the League that season. When the season was brought to an early conclusion, Campbell had led Arbroath to an impressive 5th place finish.\n\n==Stadium==\nThe Red Lichties [[Gayfield Park]] is not the club's original ground, which was nearby and was known as Lesser Gayfield. The current ground is the closest to the sea in Britain, a traditional style ground exposed to the elements, where the traditions of 'real football' are still observed where opposition fans mix as they change ends at half time to stand behind the goal their side is facing. There is terracing on three sides and enclosed stands on all four sides. On stormy winter days, waves beat on the walls surrounding the ground.\n\n==Rivalries==\n\nArbroath's main rivalry is with [[Montrose F.C.|Montrose]]. The first meeting of the sides was in 1888 and Arbroath ran out 6\u20132 winners. They also have lesser rivalries with fellow senior Angus clubs [[Brechin City F.C.|Brechin City]] and [[Forfar Athletic F.C.|Forfar Athletic]]. In the 2018\u20132019 season, all four senior Angus teams competed in Scottish League One.\n\n==Club officials==\n{{updated|1 January 2020}}<ref>{{cite

[[Scotland|Scottish]] [[association football|football]] club based in the town of [[Arbroath]], [[Angus, Scotland|Angus]]. They currently play in the [[Scottish Championship]]. The Club was founded in 1878 and plays home matches at [[Gayfield Park]]. They play in maroon strips and are nicknamed \"The Red Lichties\" due to the red light that used to guide fishing boats back from the North Sea to the [[Burgh]]'s harbour. The Red Lichties share a long-standing and fierce rivalry with local neighbours [[Montrose F.C.|Montrose]].\n\n==History==\n\n===Record score===\n{{main|Arbroath 36\u20130 Bon Accord}}\nThe Red Lichties most notable and lasting accomplishment is to hold the world record for the [[Arbroath 36 Bon Accord 0|biggest victory in World senior football]], set on 12 September 1885 when they beat [[Bon Accord F.C.|Bon Accord]] 36\u20130 in a [[Scottish Cup]] match, with a further five to seven goals disallowed for offside.<ref name=\"fourtyone\">{{cite web|author=Will Springer |year=2005 |url=http://heritage.scotsman.com/traditions.cfm?id=2372812005 |title=A day when Scottish football scorched the record books |work=The Scotsman |accessdate=9 December 2005 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20071125173220/http://heritage.scotsman.com/traditions.cfm?id=2372812005 |archivedate=25 November 2007 }}</ref><ref name=\"fourtythree\">{{cite web|publisher=Arbroath F.C. |year=2003 |url=http://www.arbroathfc.co.uk/history/36-0-team.htm |title=The 36\u20130 team |author=Fraser Clyne |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070808184847/http://www.arbroathfc.co.uk/history/36-0-team.htm |archivedate=8 August 2007 |df=dmy }}</ref> [[Jocky Petrie (footballer)|Jocky Petrie]] scored 13 goals in that game, a record for the most goals by a single player in a British senior match.\n\n===Recent history===\nThe Red Lichties have had mixed success in recent years. In the [[1996\u201397 in Scottish football|1996\u201397]] season they hit the bottom of Scottish senior football as they finished last in the [[Scottish Football League Third Division|Third Division]]. However, the following season they were promoted back to the [[Scottish Football League Second Division|Second Division]]. They spent three years at this level before winning promotion to the [[Scottish Football League First Division|First Division]]. They finished 7th in their first season in the [[Scottish Football League First Division|First Division]], 13 points clear of relegation troubles. However, in the [[2002\u201303 in Scottish football|2002\u201303]] season, the Red Lichties struggled badly, and finished bottom of the table, 20 points adrift of penultimate side [[Alloa Athletic F.C.|Alloa Athletic]]. In the [[2003\u201304 in Scottish football|2003\u201304]] season, the Red Lichties narrowly avoided back-to-back relegations, as they escaped the drop on the last day of the season. In [[2004\u201305 in Scottish football|2004\u201305]], however, there was no escaping a 3\u20130 defeat at [[Dumbarton F.C.|Dumbarton]] on 30 April 2005, which consigned the Red Lichties to the Third Division for the following season.\nThe club rose from the depths of the [[Scottish Football League Third Division|Third Division]] to the heights of the [[Scottish Football League First Division|First Division]], then fell back down to the basement league in the next few seasons. However, under manager [[John McGlashan (footballer)|John McGlashan]], the Red Lichties competed at the top of Division 3, finishing 4th in their first season and second in the next, reaching both divisional play-offs in seasons 2005\u201306 and 2006\u201307, although failing to gain promotion. They finished fourth in Division 3 and disposed of Cowdenbeath 2\u20131 on aggregate thanks to a late extra time winner from Robbie Raeside in the semifinal. Stranraer were the opponents in the play-off final and the Red Lichties ran out 2\u20130 winners in the home tie first leg at Gayfield Park thanks to a Robbie Raeside header and a Barry Sellars strike. At Stranraer, the Red Lichties goal was pummelled for much of the match and they spent much of the second half down to 10 men after Craig Tully had been red-carded. Although one goal was conceded, a resolute defence saw the Red Lichties hold on for a 2\u20131 aggregate win and promotion.\n\nThe Red Lichties managed to consolidate their position in Division 2 in 2008\u201309. The season had started well but a narrow defeat in the Scottish League Cup at Gayfield Park on penalties to Scottish Premiership side Inverness Caledonian Thistle FC, triggered a sequence of losses and the club found themselves in the bottom half of the table. The performances were boosted by loan additions such as Steven Doris, Craig Forsyth, ex-Scotland international Colin Cameron and they got results when it mattered. Safety was all but assured with a narrow 1\u20130 win over Queens Park at Hampden Park, courtesy of a fine Robbie Ross strike and a 2\u20130 victory over Stranraer at Gayfield Park with goals from Ross and Forsyth. A 2\u20132 draw against Peterhead and a 0\u20130 draw against Raith Rovers in May was enough to seal 7th spot.\n\nDuring season 2009\u201310, results seemed to go into freefall after a 6\u20130 home defeat to St Johnstone in the Scottish League Cup early in the season. John McGlashan resigned to be replaced by Jim Weir who after a mixed start eventually rallied the Red Lichties to a spirited last few weeks of the season. With a win needed against East Fife to avoid the play-offs, the side threw everything they had in the last 20 minutes to find a winner but to no avail. After beating Queens Park in the play-off semifinal, their season ended with a 2\u20130 loss to Forfar Athletic in the final. Weir resigned to take up the vacant position at Brechin City and was replaced, on 27 May, by Paul Sheerin.\n\nOn 23 April 2011, the Red Lichties defeated local rivals [[Montrose F.C.|Montrose]] 4\u20131 to win the [[2010\u201311 in Scottish football|2010\u201311]] [[Scottish Football League Third Division|Third Division]] title; securing the club's first senior honours in their 133-year history and a return to [[Scottish Football League Second Division|Second Division]] at their first attempt.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/scot_div_1/9465306.stm|title=Arbroath 4\u20131 Montrose|date=23 April 2011|work=BBC Sport|accessdate=16 May 2011}}</ref> The next few seasons in the third tier (renamed League One) were mixed. A tremendous first season playing lively attacking football saw them run champions Cowdenbeath closely, more than matching them in head-to-head encounters but lacking the professional edge to grind out other results and losing the final three. The Red Lichties finished on 60 points and went out in the playoff semifinal. In 2012\u201313, a fairly mediocre season saw them end up in 5th spot, on 52 points just pipped for the final playoff spot. One highlight was a 3rd Round Scottish Cup tie at Celtic Park, drawing 1\u20131 and then exiting in the replay after an equaliser was controversially ruled out.\n\nSeason 2013\u201314 was disastrous. After an average start, a run of 14 games without a win saw the Red Lichties end up bottom of the pile on 31 points and automatically relegated. The attack-minded and purist emphasis of manager Sheerin, who continued as player-manager, meant most fans stayed supportive. Some poor signings were costly. The Red Lichties thus experienced their fourth relegation in 11 years. Sheerin left Gayfield Park in June 2014 to take up a post with the Under-20 side at Aberdeen. Allan Moore was subsequently appointed with Todd Lumsden as assistant. On Sunday, 12 April 2015, after a string of poor results in which the side only won once in 16 games, Moore was relieved of his duties as Manager and Lumsden took the helm. The team had been sitting at the top of the table by eight points in December but ended up finishing third and subsequently lost 3\u20132 on aggregate to Queens Park in the Play Off Semifinal.\n\nThe team performed poorly under the management of Todd Lumsden in season 2015\u201316 which was reflected by a lowly league position. With relegation into the Highland League a real threat, Lumsden was sacked in March 2016. Dick Campbell was then appointed and was able to steer the team to safety, finishing 9th and ahead of East Stirlingshire who were subsequently relegated after losing the play off to Lowland League champions Edinburgh City.\n\nThe 2016\u201317 season saw a massive turnaround under the helm of Campbell. They spent much of the season in second place behind Forfar Athletic and in early February were 11 points behind their Angus neighbours after a 1\u20130 defeat by the Loons at Gayfield Park. The Red Lichties however clawed that difference back and after the penultimate game of the season's 3\u20132 win against Elgin City, found themselves a point ahead at the top of the table with an away match against Stirling Albion remaining. An astonishing 1200 fans travelled to Forthbank to witness a 1\u20131 draw but with Forfar unexpectedly losing at home to Annan 4\u20132, the title was secured.\n\nThe [[2018\u201319 Scottish League One|2018\u201319]] season saw Arbroath line-up alongside the three other Angus sides in the same League for the first time. Despite having to compete with full-time [[Raith Rovers F.C.|Raith Rovers]], the club led from the opening day to win a second promotion in three years and a first league title win in the third tier. The Championship was secured on 13 April with a 1\u20131 draw at local rivals Brechin.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.thecourier.co.uk/fp/sport/football/scottish-league-1/869860/brechin-1-arbroath-1-red-lichties-secure-title-glory-and-promotion-to-the-championship/|title=Brechin 1 Arbroath 1: Red Lichties secure title glory and promotion to the Championship|date=13 April 2019|work=The Courier|accessdate=14 April 2019}}</ref>\n\nReturning to the second tier for the first time since being relegated in the 2002-03 season, Arbroath were never in any real danger of an immediate return to League One and spent most of the season on the fringe of the promotion playoff positions. Highlights of the season included two victories against [[Inverness Caledonian Thistle F.C.|Inverness Caledonian Thistle]] and a 1-0 win against [[Dundee United F.C.|Dundee United]], which made Arbroath the only side to defeat the eventual champions at [Tannadice Park|Tannadice]] in the League that season. When the season was brought to an early conclusion, Campbell had led Arbroath to an impressive 5th place finish.\n\n==Stadium==\nThe Red Lichties [[Gayfield Park]] is not the club's original ground, which was nearby and was known as Lesser Gayfield. The current ground is the closest to the sea in Britain, a traditional style ground exposed to the elements, where the traditions of 'real football' are still observed where opposition fans mix as they change ends at half time to stand behind the goal their side is facing. There is terracing on three sides and enclosed stands on all four sides. On stormy winter days, waves beat on the walls surrounding the ground.\n\n==Rivalries==\n\nArbroath's main rivalry is with [[Montrose F.C.|Montrose]]. The first meeting of the sides was in 1888 and Arbroath ran out 6\u20132 winners. They also have lesser rivalries with fellow senior Angus clubs [[Brechin City F.C.|Brechin City]] and [[Forfar Athletic F.C.|Forfar Athletic]]. In the 2018\u20132019 season, all four senior Angus teams competed in Scottish League One.\n\n==Club officials==\n{{updated|1 January 2020}}<ref>{{cite

Cohen is a fearless time-traveler, an acrobat of sorts, who is equally adept at commenting on ancient Jewish history and biblical stories as he is about the contemporary appeal of Larry David or Woody Allen, and he often draws breathtaking comparisons between past and present Jewish life.\"<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.jpost.com/LandedPages/PrintArticle.aspx?id=149656 |title=Reality Checks |first=Elaine |last=Margolin |newspaper=The Jerusalem Post |date=2009-07-24 |accessdate=2013-01-31}}</ref>\n\nIn 2010, Cohen co-wrote the memoir ''When I Stop Talking, You'll Know I'm Dead'', the story of American film producer [[Jerry Weintraub]]; the book was a ''New York Times'' bestseller.<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/02/books/review/InsideList-t.html Jennifer Schuessler, \"Inside the List\", ''The New York Times Book Review'', April 23, 2010.]</ref>\n\n====''The Fish That Ate the Whale''====\nCohen's story of [[United Fruit]] president and banana king [[Sam Zemurray]], ''The Fish That Ate the Whale'', was published by [[Farrar, Straus & Giroux]] in 2012.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2012-06-07/book-review-the-fish-that-ate-the-whale-by-rich-cohen |title=Book Review: 'The Fish That Ate the Whale,' by Rich Cohen |first=Daniel |last=Grushkin |publisher=Bloomberg Businessweek |date=2012-06-07 |accessdate=2012-07-02}}</ref> Writing in [[The New York Times Book Review]], critic and historian Mark Lewis called the book \"[[Rudyard Kipling|Kiplingesque]]\" and \"fascinating\", and provided an overview of Cohen's work. \"Rich Cohen books constitute a genre unto themselves: pungent, breezy, vividly written psychodramas about rough-edged, tough-minded Jewish ''machers'' who vanquish their rivals, and sometimes change the world in the process.\"<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/16/books/review/the-fish-that-ate-the-whale-by-rich-cohen.html |title=Banana Republican: 'The Fish That Ate the Whale,' by Rich Cohen |first=Mark |last=Lewis |newspaper=The New York Times |date=2012-09-16 |accessdate=2012-09-16}}</ref> In [[The Christian Science Monitor]], critic Chris Hartman called the book \"masterful and elegantly written ... a cautionary tale for the ages\".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/Books/Book-Reviews/2012/1018/The-Fish-That-Ate-the-Whale |title=Book Review: The Fish That Ate the Whale |first=Chris |last=Hartman |newspaper=The Christian Science Monitor|date=2012-10-18 |accessdate=2012-10-18}}</ref> In ''[[The Washington Post]]'', James Auley called it \"immensely readable\" and \"as good an example of the American promise as one could imagine\".<ref>{{cite news|url=https://articles.washingtonpost.com/2012-07-21/entertainment/35489383_1_whale-american-promise-rich-cohen |title= The Life and Times of America's Banana King |first=James |last=Auley |newspaper=The Washington Post |date=2012-07-21 |accessdate=2012-07-21}}</ref> The [[Jerusalem Post|Jerusalem Post's]] Elaine Margolin called the book \"piercing and terrifically intuitive....

The union has consistently fought for improved pay, benefits, and job security for its members, and it has resisted efforts to vary teacher pay based on performance evaluations. It has also pushed for improvements in the Chicago schools, and since its inception argued that its activities benefited students as well as teachers.<ref>Lyons, ''Teachers and Reform'' (2008), pp. 3\u20134. \"In addition to the issue of unionization, scholars have debated whether teachers joined unions to pursue monetary gains or to reform the public schools. Since teachers founded the AFT in 1916, the organization has portrayed itself as a union fighting for better salaries and benefits for its members and improvements in the public schools. Indeed, teachers' unions across the land asserted that they wanted improved pay and conditions for teachers in order to provide quality education for the students.\"</ref>\n\nThe CTU united several teachers' organizations in Chicago in the wake of a teachers' revolt against banks during the [[Great Depression]]. It was chartered in 1937 as Local 1 of the [[American Federation of Teachers]] (AFT), in which it played a founding role. It was the largest and most active AFT Local until the 1960s.<ref>Lyons, ''Teachers and Reform'' (2008), pp. 1\u20132. \"In the early years of the twentieth century, the center of teacher unionism was found in Chicago.

Historian John F. Lyons describes these groups as key in the development of solidarity among the city's teachers:\n\n<blockquote>Many began to see the weak and divided position of the unions as the main reason for lack of success in the dispute. Accordingly, between 1931 and 1933, ordinary teachers founded a number of temporary groups to unify their ranks and actively pursue their demands. In November 1931, the South Side Teachers organized a number of mass meetings, publicity campaigns, and voting drives, and appealed without success to various teachers' unions to cooperate in framing a legislative program. Three more rank-and-file teachers' organizations emerged in 1932: The Civic Education Association of Chicago, initially organized by teachers from Senn High School on the North Side, aimed \"to bring all of the teachers of Chicago, organized and unorganized, into one effective unit.\" The Chicago Teacher Voter Association set out with the sole aim of campaigning for politicians sympathetic to the teachers' plight. The South Side Teachers called for a boycott of stores, hotels, and other businesses that had participated in the tax strike.<ref>Lyons, ''Teachers and Reform'' (2008), p. 35\u201336.</ref></blockquote>\n\nTeachers increasingly began to feel singled out for bad treatment by the city. This feeling was amplified in March 1933 when teachers learned that, as teacher pay was being further cut by 15%, school janitors had received a secret raise. The city announced furthermore that on the next pay day all municipal employees except teachers would be paid.<ref>Lyons, ''Teachers and Reform'' (2008), p. 38.</ref>\n\n====Teachers revolt====\nIn April 1933, teachers targeted banks in the downtown [[Chicago Loop|Loop]], which they held \"financially responsible\" for the $30 million deficit in teacher payments.<ref name=\"NYT - 25 April 1933\">{{cite news|title=5,000 Chicago Teachers Storm Five Banks; Dawes Heckled as He Argues With Crowd|newspaper=New York Times|date=25 April 1933|agency=AP|id={{ProQuest|100724303}}}}</ref>  On April 24, 1933 (the beginning of spring break), thousands of teachers entered bank offices and began causing mayhem.

The union has consistently fought for improved pay, benefits, and job security for its members, and it has resisted efforts to vary teacher pay based on performance evaluations. It has also pushed for improvements in the Chicago schools, and since its inception argued that its activities benefited students as well as teachers.<ref>Lyons, ''Teachers and Reform'' (2008), pp. 3\u20134. \"In addition to the issue of unionization, scholars have debated whether teachers joined unions to pursue monetary gains or to reform the public schools. Since teachers founded the AFT in 1916, the organization has portrayed itself as a union fighting for better salaries and benefits for its members and improvements in the public schools. Indeed, teachers' unions across the land asserted that they wanted improved pay and conditions for teachers in order to provide quality education for the students.\"</ref>\n\nThe CTU united several teachers' organizations in Chicago in the wake of a teachers' revolt against banks during the [[Great Depression]]. It was chartered in 1937 as Local 1 of the [[American Federation of Teachers]] (AFT), in which it played a founding role. It was the largest and most active AFT Local until the 1960s.<ref>Lyons, ''Teachers and Reform'' (2008), pp. 1\u20132. \"In the early years of the twentieth century, the center of teacher unionism was found in Chicago. [...]  The CTU attracted a majority of Chicago teachers and remained the largest and most influential AFT local until the 1960s.\"</ref> The CTU won [[collective bargaining]] rights in 1966 and conducted several [[Strike action|strikes]] during the 1970s and 1980s. In September 2012, the union began its first strike in 25 years.\n\nThe CTU is also affiliated with the Illinois Federation of Teachers, the [[Chicago Federation of Labor]], and the [[AFL-CIO]]. It has more than 25,000 members. Current officers come from the Caucus of Rank-and-File Educators, elected in 2010 to replace the longstanding United Progressive Caucus. From that point until her 2018 retirement, [[Karen Lewis (labor leader)|Karen Lewis]] was president. Through a successors election the new officer slate became: President [[Jesse Sharkey]], Vice President Stacy Davis Gates, Recording Secretary Michael Brunson and Financial Secretary Maria Moreno.<ref name=\"CTU Contacts\">{{cite web|title=For Members \u00bb CTU Contacts|url=http://www.ctunet.com/for-members/contacts|publisher=Chicago Teachers Union|accessdate=20 September 2012}}</ref><ref name=\"CT - Key Players\">{{cite news|title=Key players Sketches of negotiators in teachers contract talks|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2012-09-11/news/ct-met-teachers-strike-thumbnails-20120911_1_alicia-winckler-jesse-sharkey-cps|accessdate=20 September 2012|newspaper=Chicago Tribune|date=11 September 2012}}</ref>\n\n==Origins==\n\n===Chicago Teachers Federation===\nThe CTU originated from the Chicago Teachers Federation (CTF), an organization of women elementary school teachers founded in 1897.

For most of this century, boards of education denied female teachers equal pay with men, the right to marry, and access to leadership positions in the schools. In Chicago, female elementary school teachers used the union as a vehicle to campaign for equal pay with high school teachers.\"</ref> The CTF also launched a successful campaign against corporate tax evasion, the compensation for which was used to pay back salaries upon which the city had reneged.<ref name=\"West 1971\" />\n\nIn 1902, the CTF joined the [[Chicago Federation of Labor]] (CFL).

However, the board was still appointed by city politicians. In the coming years, the city and School Board were accused of rampant corruption, particularly in connection with two-time mayor [[William Hale Thompson]].<ref>Lyons, ''Teachers and Reform'' (2008), p. 12. \"At no time was this political control of Chicago public education more apparent than under the regime of Republican mayor William H.

They believed that Chicago's banks had access to millions of dollars in unpaid taxes that might balance the city's budget; they were angry about the CCPE's explicitly anti-school agenda, and they were also provoked by a $90 million bank bailout from the [[Reconstruction Finance Corporation]] that did nothing to help the schools.<ref name=\"Simpson - 2 Aug 2012\" /> More generally, teachers were alarmed by an apparent corporate attack on education; they believed that the nation's ruling class wanted to dismantle education for the public and reserve it only for the wealthy.<ref>Lyons, ''Teachers and Reform'' (2008), p. 36\u201337. \"Teachers began to express the idea that they were defending democracy and the public education system from self-serving business and political elites. Reflecting a general public optimism with the promise of education, teachers viewed the schools as avenues for social mobility and bulwarks of a more democratic society. [...] Many teachers believed there was a nationwide plot by people of power and wealth to cripple public education and to restrict schooling to those who could afford it.\"</ref>\n\nProtests and petitions mounted from 1931\u20131932. Students planned a solidarity demonstration, and although many were convinced to stay in school, 13,000 students actually walked out.<ref name=\"CSM 6 April 133\">{{cite news|title=Chicago Students Strike in Protest To Help Teachers: Thousands Walk Out of High Schools to Force Paying Back Salaries|newspaper=Christian Science Monitor|date=6 April 1933|id={{ProQuest|513352228}}}}</ref> Teachers became frustrated with union leaders who urged restraint for the teachers and argued amongst each other; new rank-and-file organizations emerged. Historian John F. Lyons describes these groups as key in the development of solidarity among the city's teachers:\n\n<blockquote>Many began to see the weak and divided position of the unions as the main reason for lack of success in the dispute. Accordingly, between 1931 and 1933, ordinary teachers founded a number of temporary groups to unify their ranks and actively pursue their demands. In November 1931, the South Side Teachers organized a number of mass meetings, publicity campaigns, and voting drives, and appealed without success to various teachers' unions to cooperate in framing a legislative program. Three more rank-and-file teachers' organizations emerged in 1932: The Civic Education Association of Chicago, initially organized by teachers from Senn High School on the North Side, aimed \"to bring all of the teachers of Chicago, organized and unorganized, into one effective unit.\" The Chicago Teacher Voter Association set out with the sole aim of campaigning for politicians sympathetic to the teachers' plight. The South Side Teachers called for a boycott of stores, hotels, and other businesses that had participated in the tax strike.<ref>Lyons, ''Teachers and Reform'' (2008), p. 35\u201336.</ref></blockquote>\n\nTeachers increasingly began to feel singled out for bad treatment by the city. This feeling was amplified in March 1933 when teachers learned that, as teacher pay was being further cut by 15%, school janitors had received a secret raise. The city announced furthermore that on the next pay day all municipal employees except teachers would be paid.<ref>Lyons, ''Teachers and Reform'' (2008), p. 38.</ref>\n\n====Teachers revolt====\nIn April 1933, teachers targeted banks in the downtown [[Chicago Loop|Loop]], which they held \"financially responsible\" for the $30 million deficit in teacher payments.<ref name=\"NYT - 25 April 1933\">{{cite news|title=5,000 Chicago Teachers Storm Five Banks; Dawes Heckled as He Argues With Crowd|newspaper=New York Times|date=25 April 1933|agency=AP|id={{ProQuest|100724303}}}}</ref>  On April 24, 1933 (the beginning of spring break), thousands of teachers entered bank offices and began causing mayhem.

During the final decade, the outside world beat upon Abbot's doors with such insistence that they must either be opened up or broken down. The Trustees opened them and the world rushed in like a clumsy repairman, knocking over tables and trampling valuable heirlooms, but also bringing fresh air into musty places, and piling on the floor a heap of lumber and tools with which to build anew.|Susan Lloyd, in ''A Singular School''.<ref name = SingularSchool/>}}\n\nAccording to Lloyd, Abbot Academy seemed to be a \"nineteenth century school\" which was stagnant and insular and limited in comparison with the abrupt societal changes made during the 1960s.<ref name = SingularSchool/> In 1967, there were greater ties between [[Phillips Academy]] and Abbot, including a Phillips-Abbot committee to explore a \"wide range of shared activities\" between the two schools.<ref name = SingularSchool/> Abbot trustee Philip Allen had determined that both schools should merge, but that this was a \"hidden agenda\"; Allen brought in headmaster Donald Gordon, a graduate of Phillips Academy and Yale, to bring \"Abbot up to the point where it could \nbe part of Phillips Academy.\"<ref name = SingularSchool/><ref name = SingularSchool/> Abbot's \"old dress code\" was abolished for a \"neat and clean\" requirement.<ref name = SingularSchool/> The 1969-70 year was \"tumultuous\" nationwide, with student revolts on many college campuses and foreign policy failures abroad.<ref name = SingularSchool/> The following is a description of Abbot campus life in 1969:<ref name = SingularSchool/>\n\n{{Quote|Touch football players romped on the sacred Circle.

The merger was brought about by many factors, including the sense of shared history and goals between the two schools, common activities, plus survey research showing that 94% of students in northeastern secondary schools wished for coeducation.<ref name = SingularSchool/> The times \"favored coeducation\"; in 1968, 53 colleges and universities either became coeducational or began coordinate instruction.<ref name = SingularSchool/> While Phillips Academy \"held the cards\" regarding whether the two schools should merge, there was a \"crasser impetus\" from admissions statistics, as Phillips was increasingly being turned down by applicants preferring newly-coeducational competitors such as St. Paul's, Taft, Northfield-Mount Hermon, and Exeter.<ref name = SingularSchool/> Many committee meetings, including discussions between administrators and teachers, happened over a sixteen-month period.<ref name = SingularSchool/> The Phillips headmaster, John Kemper, who had kinship ties with women graduates of Abbot, felt a merger was \"practical, ethical, and educationally sound\", although several times the Phillips Board of Trustees refused to sanction a merger.<ref name = SingularSchool/> The school merged with Phillips Academy on June 28, 1973.<ref name = SusanLloyd/> Many Abbot traditions were included in the combined school, such as having a designated weekend in the fall for parents to visit.\n\n{{Quote|Parents\u2019 Weekend was Abbot\u2019s response to formalize parent visits to the school.
