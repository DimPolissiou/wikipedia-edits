The Buccaneers compete in the [[National Football League]] (NFL) as a member club of the league's [[National Football Conference]] (NFC) [[NFC South|South]] division. The club joined the NFL in {{nfly|1976}} as an [[expansion team]], along with the [[Seattle Seahawks]]. Tampa Bay played its first season in the [[American Football Conference]] (AFC) [[AFC West|West]] division as part of the 1976 expansion plan, whereby each new franchise would play every other franchise over the first two years. After the season, the team switched conferences with the Seahawks and became a member of the [[NFC North|NFC Central]] division. During the 2002 league realignment, the Buccaneers joined three former [[NFC West]] teams to form the NFC South. The club is owned by the [[Malcolm Glazer|Glazer family]], and plays its home games at [[Raymond James Stadium]] in Tampa.\n\nThe Buccaneers are the first post-[[AFL\u2013NFL merger|merger]] [[expansion team]] to win a division championship, a playoff game, and to host and play in a conference championship game; all three accomplishments occurred during the [[1979 NFL season|1979 season]]. They are also the first team since the merger to complete a winning season when starting 10 or more rookies, which happened in the 2010 season.  In 1976 and 1977, the Buccaneers lost their first 26 games. They would not win their first game in franchise history until Week 13, of 14, in 1977. After a brief winning era in the late 1970s and early 1980s, the team suffered through 14 consecutive losing seasons. Then, for a 10-year period, they were consistent playoff contenders and won [[Super Bowl XXXVII]] at the end of the [[2002 NFL season|2002 season]], but have not yet returned to the Super Bowl.\n\n==\"Tampa Bay\"==\nThe name [[Tampa Bay Area|\"Tampa Bay\"]] is often used to describe a geographic metropolitan area which encompasses the cities around the body of water known as [[Tampa Bay]], including [[Tampa, Florida|Tampa]], [[St. Petersburg, Florida|St. Petersburg]], [[Clearwater, Florida|Clearwater]] and several smaller cities. Unlike in the case of [[Green Bay, Wisconsin]], there is no municipality known as \"Tampa Bay\". The \"Tampa Bay\" in the names of local professional sports franchises, such as the Buccaneers, [[Tampa Bay Lightning|Lightning]], [[Tampa Bay Rays|Rays]], [[Tampa Bay Rowdies|Rowdies]], and the former [[Tampa Bay Storm|Storm]] and [[Tampa Bay Mutiny|Mutiny]], denotes that they represent the entire region, not just the city of Tampa.\n\n==Franchise history==\n{{main|History of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers}}\n\n===1976\u20131978===\n<!-- [[WP:NFCC]] violation: [[File:John McKay (American football).jpg|thumbnail|[[John McKay (American football)|John McKay]] was the team's first coach from 1976 to 1984.]] -->\nThe Buccaneers joined the NFL as members of the [[AFC West]] in 1976. The following year, they were moved to the [[NFC North|NFC Central]], while the other 1976 expansion team, the [[Seattle Seahawks]], switched conferences with Tampa Bay and joined the AFC West. This realignment was dictated by the league as part of the 1976 expansion plan, so that both teams could play each other twice and every other NFL franchise once during their first two seasons. Instead of a traditional schedule of playing each division opponent twice, the Buccaneers played every conference team once, plus the Seahawks.<ref>{{cite news|title=The Answer Man, Series 2, Vol. 18|url=https://www.buccaneers.com/news/the-answer-man-series-2-vol-18-2145514|publisher=NFL Enterprises, LLC|website=Buccaneers.com|date=June 20, 2005|access-date=June 30, 2019}}</ref>\n\nTampa Bay did not win their first game until the 13th week of their [[1977 Tampa Bay Buccaneers season|second season]], starting with a record of 0\u201326 (though the Bucs had beaten the [[1976 Atlanta Falcons season|Atlanta Falcons]], 17\u20133, in a 1976 pre-season game before their first regular season).<ref>Underwood, John. \"A Three-hour Time Difference\".

In the first, [[STP (motor oil company)|STP]] was put all over the goal posts in Tampa to prevent the goalposts from being ripped down in the event of a celebration. Four blocked kicks later, the Bucs wasted the oily substance, falling to the [[1979 Minnesota Vikings season|Minnesota Vikings]] 23\u201322. STP was wasted again the following week as the Bucs were shut out 14\u20130 by the [[1979 Chicago Bears season|Chicago Bears]], and in [[O. J. Simpson]]'s final home game in [[1979 San Francisco 49ers season|San Francisco]], Tampa Bay lost its third straight attempt to clinch a division title against a 49ers team which came in with a 1\u201313 record. However, in the season finale at home against the [[1979 Kansas City Chiefs season|Kansas City Chiefs]], which was played in the worst downpour in Bucs history, Tampa Bay pulled out a 3\u20130 victory. Finishing with a 10\u20136 record, the Bucs had their first winning season in franchise history, and won the Central Division in a tiebreaker over the Bears. In an upset, the Bucs defeated the [[1979 Philadelphia Eagles season|Philadelphia Eagles]] 24\u201317 in the divisional round of the [[NFL playoffs, 1979-80|playoffs]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://dynamic.si.cnn.com/si_online/covers/issues/1980/0107.html|title=SI.com \u2013 Sports Illustrated Covers \u2013 January 7, 1980|publisher=|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070612064908/http://dynamic.si.cnn.com/si_online/covers/issues/1980/0107.html|archivedate=June 12, 2007|df=}}</ref> Because the [[1979 Los Angeles Rams season|Los Angeles Rams]] defeated the [[1979 Dallas Cowboys season|Dallas Cowboys]] in the other NFC playoff game, the Bucs hosted the [[NFC Championship Game]] the following week in Tampa. The Bucs lost to the Rams 9\u20130. In their fourth season, the Bucs seemed on the verge of fulfilling McKay's five-year plan.\n\nThe Bucs made the playoffs again by winning their division in the [[1981 Tampa Bay Buccaneers season|1981 season]]. It came down to a thrilling final game at [[1981 Detroit Lions season|Detroit]]; the winner would take the Central Division crown and the loser would miss the playoffs. The Lions had not lost at home all season. Although the Bucs trailed early, an 84-yard touchdown bomb from QB Williams to WR [[Kevin House]] and a fumble recovery for a touchdown by DT [[David Logan (American football)|David Logan]] sealed the win for the Bucs. In the playoffs, the [[1981 Dallas Cowboys season|Dallas Cowboys]] defeated the Bucs, 38\u20130, in the divisional round.\n\nThe [[1982 Tampa Bay Buccaneers season|1982 season]] started 0\u20133 for the Bucs, before a [[1982 NFL Players Strike|player's strike]] shut down the NFL for seven weeks. When the league resumed play, the Bucs were nicknamed the \"Cardiac Kids\" for winning five of their next six games, all in the final moments, to go 5\u20134 and qualify for the expanded playoff slate. In the first round, the Bucs once again faced the [[1982 Dallas Cowboys season|Cowboys]] at Dallas, losing 30\u201317. As it turned out, this would be the last winning regular season under Culverhouse's ownership.\n\n===1983\u20131996===\nBefore the 1983 season, Williams bolted to the [[United States Football League]] in a salary dispute. The Bucs lost their first nine games of the 1983 season en route to finishing 2\u201314, the first of 12 consecutive seasons with at least ten losses\u2014an NFL record. Included was the drafting of [[Heisman Trophy]] winner [[Bo Jackson]] with the first pick in the [[1986 NFL Draft|1986 draft]]. Jackson had let it be known that he would never play a down for Hugh Culverhouse at Tampa Bay. Making good on his threat, he opted instead to play baseball for the [[Kansas City Royals]] and would later return for parts of football seasons with the [[Oakland Raiders|Los Angeles Raiders]]. Along with Williams, who later was a Super Bowl champion QB for Washington, two other Buc quarterbacks during this era led other teams to Super Bowl wins. [[Steve Young]] won with the 49ers and [[Trent Dilfer]] won with the Baltimore Ravens.\n\nUnder Culverhouse, the Bucs were one of the NFL's more profitable teams during the 1980s; however, this was largely because he kept the payroll among the lowest in the league, hampering their ability to sign quality players. Attendance also sagged; at one point the Buccaneers went parts of three whole seasons without having a home game televised locally, and when they did it was more attributed to a strong visiting team with a large following in the area, such as the Chicago Bears or Green Bay Packers.\n\n[[Hardy Nickerson]], a future 5-time Pro Bowl linebacker, signed as a free agent from the Pittsburgh Steelers. [[John Lynch (American football)|John Lynch]], a future Pro Bowl strong safety, was drafted in 1993. In the [[1995 NFL draft]] the Buccaneers drafted two future Hall of Famers: [[Warren Sapp]] and [[Derrick Brooks]]. Pro Bowl Fullback, [[Mike Alstott]], was drafted the next year in the 1996 draft.\n\n===1994\u20131996===\nDespite the profitability of the Buccaneers in the 1980s, Culverhouse's death in 1994 revealed a team close to [[bankruptcy]], which surprised many observers.{{Citation needed|date=December 2015}} His son, [[Miami]] attorney Hugh Culverhouse Jr., practically forced{{Citation needed|date=December 2015}} the trustees of his father's estate to sell the team, which cast doubt on the future of the franchise in Tampa. Interested parties included [[New York Yankees]] owner [[George Steinbrenner]] and [[Baltimore Orioles]] owner [[Peter Angelos]], the latter of whom publicly declared he would move the team to [[Baltimore]], as the city did not have an NFL franchise at that time.\n\nHowever, in a last-minute surprise, real estate magnate [[Malcolm Glazer]] outbid both of them for $192 million, the highest sale price for a professional sports franchise up to that point. Glazer immediately placed his sons [[Bryan Glazer|Bryan]], [[Edward Glazer|Edward]], and [[Joel Glazer|Joel]] in charge of the team's financial affairs. He stated that he had every intention of keeping the team in Tampa, but informed area citizens its current stadium deal would not support the record paid amount and that a new stadium would be required. The Glazers convinced [[Hillsborough County, Florida|Hillsborough County]] voters to raise sales taxes to fund the construction of what would become [[Raymond James Stadium]].\n\nThe Glazers' deep pockets and serious commitment to fielding a winning team\u2013in Tampa Bay\u2013finally allowed the Bucs to become competitive. The team's performance dramatically improved when the Glazers hired Minnesota Vikings defensive coordinator [[Tony Dungy]] as head coach, jettisoned the old uniform designs (see below).\n\n===1996\u20132001: Tony Dungy era===\nDuring [[1996 Tampa Bay Buccaneers season|Dungy's first season in 1996]], the team continued to struggle, starting the season 1\u20138. But in the second half of the season they finished 5\u20132, primarily due to the performance of a defense ranked seventh in the NFL led by [[Hardy Nickerson]] and the maturing of Sam Wyche's draftees Brooks, Lynch, and Sapp. Dungy, with his even-tempered personality, quickly brought balance and morale to the team, and his [[Football coverage shells#Cover 2|Cover 2]] defensive scheme, sharpened to perfection by [[defensive coordinator]] [[Monte Kiffin]] and linebackers coach [[Lovie Smith]], became the foundation for Tampa Bay's future success.<ref>{{cite news|title=Tony Dungy to Join Buccaneers Ring of Honor|url=https://www.buccaneers.com/news/tony-dungy-to-join-buccaneers-ring-of-honor-20639092|publisher=NFL Enterprises, LLC|website=Buccaneers.com|date=February 4, 2019|access-date=June 30, 2019}}</ref> Their version of Cover 2 was so successful that it became known as the [[Tampa 2]].<ref>{{cite news|last=Varley|first=Teresa|title=Tony Dungy credits Chuck Noll with his defensive philosophy|url=http://news.steelers.com/article/73586/|publisher=NFL Enterprises, LLC|website=Steelers.com|date=January 31, 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070209171311/http://news.steelers.com/article/73586/|archive-date=February 9, 2007|access-date=June 30, 2019|url-status=dead}}</ref> It has been brought to the [[Chicago Bears]] by Smith, [[Detroit Lions]] by Rod Marinelli, [[Kansas City Chiefs]] by [[Herman Edwards]] and to the [[Indianapolis Colts]] by Dungy himself, and copied by several other teams.\n\nThe team started the [[1997 Tampa Bay Buccaneers season|1997 season]] 5\u20130, picking up where they left off the previous year, and this quick start once again landed them on the cover of ''Sports Illustrated'' twice.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://dynamic.si.cnn.com/si_online/covers/issues/1997/0908.html|title=SI.com \u2013 Sports Illustrated Covers \u2013 September 8, 1997|publisher=|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070212122458/http://dynamic.si.cnn.com/si_online/covers/issues/1997/0908.html|archivedate=February 12, 2007|df=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://dynamic.si.cnn.com/si_online/covers/issues/1997/0929.html|title=SI.com \u2013 September 29, 1997|publisher=|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070212122508/http://dynamic.si.cnn.com/si_online/covers/issues/1997/0929.html|archivedate=February 12, 2007|df=}}</ref>  The Bucs went 10\u20136 for their first winning season and playoff appearance since 1982, as a wild-card team.

They lost at [[Lambeau Field]] to the eventual NFC champion [[1997 Green Bay Packers season|Green Bay Packers]] 21\u20137. Still, there was reason for optimism, and the expectations were high for the following season.\n\nThe [[1998 Tampa Bay Buccaneers season|1998 season]], the first to be played in the newly constructed [[Raymond James Stadium]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://raymondjamesstadium.com/stadium-history/|title=Stadium History \u2013 Raymond James Stadium|author=|date=|website=raymondjamesstadium.com|accessdate=February 4, 2019}}</ref> saw the Bucs lose several close games en route to a disappointing 8\u20138 record. The Bucs had to play the first 6 football games of the year (including preseason) on the road as the new stadium was not quite finished.\n\nThe [[1999 Tampa Bay Buccaneers season|1999 season]] brought much better fortune. On the strength of the NFL's number 3 overall defense and a performance by rookie QB [[Shaun King (American football)|Shaun King]], the Bucs finished the season with an 11\u20135 record and won their third NFC Central Division Championship. They beat [[1999 Washington Redskins season|Washington]] 14\u201313 in the Divisional round, before losing to the eventual Super Bowl Champion [[1999 St. Louis Rams season|St. Louis Rams]] in a low-scoring NFC Championship Game, 11\u20136. The Bucs' loss was controversial, highlighted by the reversal of a pass from King to WR [[Bert Emanuel]], which ended the Bucs' chances at continuing their last-minute drive. In league meetings following the season, the NFL changed the rules regarding what constituted an [[incomplete pass]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/football/nfl/news/2000/03/28/meetings_celebrations_ap/|archiveurl=https://archive.today/20120731052158/http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/football/nfl/news/2000/03/28/meetings_celebrations_ap/|url-status=dead|title=CNNSI.com - NFL Football - NFL competition committee advises reducing\u2026|author=|date=July 31, 2012|archivedate=July 31, 2012|website=archive.is|accessdate=February 4, 2019}}</ref>\n\nWhile the Bucs played well in [[2000 Tampa Bay Buccaneers season|2000]] and [[2001 Tampa Bay Buccaneers season|2001]] and made the playoffs in each season, they were unable to fulfill their primary goal of a Super Bowl victory.

Several potential candidates were offered the job, including [[University of Florida]] head coach (and former Buccaneers quarterback) [[Steve Spurrier]], former [[New York Giants]] head coach [[Bill Parcells]], and Baltimore Ravens defensive coordinator [[Marvin Lewis]]. Spurrier jumped to the Redskins when he was offered the most lucrative salary package ever offered to an NFL head coach, and Parcells eventually passed on the Bucs' offer\u2014the second time he had done so in the history of the franchise. Bucs' general manager Rich McKay threw his support behind Lewis. The Glazer brothers were so displeased with the selection of yet another defensive-minded coach that they overruled McKay and took control of the candidate search themselves. They made it clear that their top choice was [[Jon Gruden]]; however, he was still under contract with the [[Oakland Raiders]].\n\nWhile talks with the Raiders were secretly under way, the Glazers publicly pursued another respected offensive mind, [[San Francisco 49ers]] head coach [[Steve Mariucci]]. Just when initial reports indicated that Mariucci had agreed to become both the Bucs' head coach and their general manager, Raiders owner [[Al Davis]] agreed to release Gruden to Tampa Bay.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/02/19/sports/pro-football-buccaneers-get-gruden-but-pay-a-steep-price.html|title=PRO FOOTBALL; Buccaneers Get Gruden, But Pay a Steep Price|first=Buster|last=Olney|date=February 19, 2002|publisher=|accessdate=February 4, 2019|via=NYTimes.com}}</ref>\n\nThe Glazers' shrewd move eventually paid off in acquiring Gruden, but it was costly.

On the same day, the New England Patriots made an agreement to trade Gronkowski to the Buccaneers, along with a seventh-round pick in exchange for a compensatory fourth round pick in the [[2020 NFL Draft]].\n\n==Defense==\nThroughout their history, the Buccaneers have been known for their suffocating defense. It started with the drafting of Hall of Fame defensive end [[Lee Roy Selmon]] with their first pick ever in 1976. Three Buccaneer players have been named the [[AP NFL Defensive Player of the Year Award|AP Defensive Player of the Year]], and the team has led the league in total defense on three occasions. The 2002 Super Bowl Champion Tampa Bay Buccaneers had the number one Defense that year and it was one of the Greatest NFL Defenses of All Time along  with the 1985 Bears, 2000 Ravens and 2015 Broncos. All four of the Buccaneers [[Pro Football Hall of Fame|Hall of Fame]] inductees are defensive players or coaches. \n===1978\u20131982===\nLed by Selmon, Linebackers [[Dewey Selmon]], [[Richard Wood (American football)|Richard Wood]], [[Dave Lewis (linebacker)|Dave Lewis]], and [[Mike Washington]], [[Mark Cotney]], and [[Cedric Brown]] in the secondary, the early years Buccaneers quickly earned an identity as a defensive team. Their 3\u20134 defense peaked in 1979 when they led the league in total defense, points allowed, and first downs allowed. Lee Roy Selmon was voted NFL Defensive Player of the Year, but they eventually fell 10 points short of the [[Super Bowl]] as the offense held them back in the NFC Championship game in a 9\u20130 loss to the [[Los Angeles Rams]].\n\n===1997\u20132008: The Tampa 2===\n{{main|Tampa 2}}\nThe team drafted franchise cornerstones [[John Lynch (American football)|John Lynch]] in 1993, and [[Warren Sapp]] and [[Derrick Brooks]] in 1995 to go along with All-Pro linebacker [[Hardy Nickerson]]. That was followed by the hiring of innovative defensive coordinator [[Monte Kiffin]] in 1996. The new-look Buccaneers set the stage for one of the greatest defensive runs in NFL history. From 1997 to 2008, the Buccaneers defense finished in the league's top ten every year but one, including eight top-5 finishes, and two top-ranked efforts. Kiffin along with head coach [[Tony Dungy]] created the \"[[Tampa 2]]\" defense, a modified version of the established [[Cover 2]] scheme.\n\nKiffin's defenses were known as gang tacklers with tremendous team speed with a front four that could pressure the quarterback consistently, fast sideline-to-sideline linebackers, and a hard-hitting secondary that caused turnovers. Many teams have copied the Tampa 2, but none have come close to the success the Buccaneers experienced led by numerous Pro Bowlers and Hall of Famers. The Tampa Bay defense featured future Hall of Famers, [[Derrick Brooks]] and [[Warren Sapp]], and Pro Bowlers, [[John Lynch (American football)|John Lynch]], [[Ronde Barber]], [[Hardy Nickerson]], [[Simeon Rice]], [[Shelton Quarles]], [[Donnie Abraham]], and [[Super Bowl XXXVII]] MVP [[Dexter Jackson (safety)|Dexter Jackson]]. Sapp and Nickerson were named to the [[National Football League 1990s All-Decade Team|1990s All-Decade 2nd Team]] while the [[National Football League 2000s All-Decade Team|2000s All-Decade Team]] featured Sapp and Brooks as 1st Team players and Ronde Barber on the 2nd Team.\n\n====2002 defense====\n[[File:Tampabaybucsplayersreunion.JPG|thumb|175px|Players from the 2002 team along with head coach Jon Gruden]]\nThe 2002 Buccaneers defense is widely regarded as one of the greatest defenses in NFL history, rivaled only by the 2000 Ravens, 1985 Bears, 2015 Broncos, 1976 Steelers, and few others. In the regular season Tampa Bay led the league in total defense (252.8 ypg), points allowed (196), first downs allowed (14.8 pg), passing (155.6 ypg), interceptions (31), interceptions returned for touchdowns (5), opponent passer rating (48.4), and shutouts (2). They also finished third in opponent rushing average (3.8 ypc), and sixth in sacks (43). [[Derrick Brooks]] was awarded AP Defensive Player of the Year as the defense led the way to a 12\u20134 regular season. The team was even better in the postseason allowing only 37 points in three games combined \u2013 all against top ten offenses. In those three playoff games, they intercepted 9 passes \u2013 returning 4 for touchdowns \u2013 and collected 11 sacks.\n\nIn [[Super Bowl XXXVII]], the Buccaneers delivered one of the most impressive defensive performances in Super Bowl history. Playing against the #1 offense in the league led by league MVP [[Rich Gannon]], the defense actually outscored the [[Oakland Raiders|Raiders]] offense, allowing 2 offensive touchdowns while returning 3 interceptions for touchdowns. The defense set two records in the 48\u201321 blowout, one for most interceptions in a Super Bowl (5), and one for most interceptions returned for touchdowns in a Super Bowl (3). In 19 total games in 2002, the Buccaneers recorded 40 interceptions, 53 sacks, and 9 defensive touchdowns.\n\n==Team facilities==\n{{multiple image\n | align = right\n | direction = horizontal\n | header =\n | header_align = left/right/center\n | header_background =\n | footer =\n | footer_align = left/right/center\n | footer_background = \n | width =\n | image1 = Tampa Stadium1.jpg\n | width1 = 227\n | caption1 = [[Tampa Stadium]], where the Buccaneers played for their first 22 seasons\n | image2 = Raymond James Stadium01.jpg\n | width2 = 201\n | caption2 = [[Raymond James Stadium]], where the Buccaneers play\n}}\nSince 1998 the Buccaneers have played their home games at [[Raymond James Stadium]] in Tampa. Prior to that they played in [[Tampa Stadium]] since their establishment.\n\nIn 1975, the Buccaneers built a small practice complex with offices near [[Tampa International Airport]] called One Buccaneer Place  - often shorted to \"One Buc Place\". The team utilized the unspectacular facility through the 1990s and into the early 2000s. As other NFL clubs began replacing and upgrading their respective facilities, Buccaneers players and coaches stepped up their complaints about the constant aircraft noise, cramped offices, small locker rooms, and decrepit condition of One Buc Place. Then-head coach Jon Gruden sarcastically referred to the facility as \"The Woodshed\", and some of the coaches' offices were actually converted broom [[closet]]s.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.sptimes.com/2006/08/18/news_pf/Bucs/Time_to_say_goodbye.shtml|title=Time to say goodbye|publisher=St. Pete Times|first=Rick|last=Stroud|date=August 18, 2006|access-date=October 2, 2017}}</ref> For much of the team's existence, the Buccaneers held [[Training camp (National Football League)|training camp]] on the [[University of Tampa]] campus, then at the expansive and better-equipped [[ESPN Wide World of Sports Complex|Disney's Wide World of Sports Complex]] near Orlando (2002\u20132008).\n\n[[File:Raymond James Stadium03.jpg|thumb|175px|The pirate ship at Raymond James Stadium]]\nIn August 2006, the Buccaneers unveiled a new $30 million training facility. Conveniently located across the street from [[Raymond James Stadium]] (on the former site of [[Tampa Bay Center]]), the state-of-the-art ({{convert|145000|sqft|adj=on}} facility on {{convert|33|acre}}) is one of the largest in the NFL. Its features include offices and meeting rooms, three natural grass practice fields, a theater for meetings and press conferences, an expanded weight room, a fully equipped kitchen and dining room, a rehabilitation center with three separate pools and a locker room twice the size of the former location. The building is capped off with a five-story glass and steel football as a key design element. An indoor practice field, featuring artificial turf, was completed in 2017. In 2009, the team began holding training camp at the new upgraded facilities in Tampa.\n\nIn the second week of September 2007, statues of important figures from the Bucs 2002 championship season were moved into the lobby area in an exhibit called \"Moment of Victory\". The life-size statues included players [[Mike Alstott]], [[Ronde Barber]], [[Derrick Brooks]], [[Brad Johnson (American football)|Brad Johnson]], [[John Lynch (American football)|John Lynch]], [[Shelton Quarles]], [[Simeon Rice]], [[Warren Sapp]], and head coach [[Jon Gruden]]. The statues are modeled after images from the sideline towards the end of [[Super Bowl XXXVII]].<ref>{{cite news|last=Stroud|first=Rick|title=Bucs' moment of victory is permanently set|url=http://www.sptimes.com/2007/09/18/Bucs/_Bucs__moment_of_vict.shtml|newspaper=Tampa Bay Times|date=September 18, 2007|access-date=September 18, 2016}}</ref>\n\nInitially, the facility might have been unnamed, but for over a decade, it simply was referred to as \"One Buc Place\", utilizing the same name as the old building. In 2018, the facility was officially named AdventHealth Training Center, as part of a ten-year naming rights deal with [[Adventist Health System|AdventHealth]] (formerly [[Florida Hospital]]).<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.pewterreport.com/bucs-team-up-with-advent-health-on-new-facility-naming-rights/|title=Bucs Team Up With AdventHealth On New Facility Naming Rights|publisher=Pewter Reports|first=Mark|last=Cook|date=August 27, 2018|access-date=August 29, 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Logos and uniforms==\n\n===1976\u20131996===\nWhen the team began play in 1976, Culverhouse initially picked team colors of red, green, orange and white. However, the shade of green was too close to the teal that used by the [[Miami Dolphins]]. A medium shade of \"Florida Orange\" was substituted for green. Home uniforms included orange jerseys with white numerals outlined in red\u2014the now-infamous \"[[Creamsicle]]\" uniforms. Road white jerseys originally had orange numerals outlined in red, but these colors were reversed for year two and beyond. The color swap provided better visibility, especially for television coverage purposes.\n\nLong-time ''[[Tampa Tribune]]'' cartoonist and [[Ye Mystic Krewe of Gasparilla]] member [[Lamar Sparkman]] designed the first team logo.<ref>Gershman, Rick. \"101 Gasparilla\".

[[Beloit College]], located in Beloit, Wisconsin, received a notice from the Tampa Bay Buccaneers of the college's illegitimate use of their mascot. Beloit College's buccaneer is the mirror image of the Tampa Bay buccaneer, with the creamsicle colors replaced with Beloit's school colors.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mascotdb.com/team.php?id=40206 |title=Beloit College Buccaneers |publisher=MASCOTdb.com |date= |access-date=September 3, 2012}}</ref> Athletic Director Ed DeGeorge said Beloit's Buccaneers have used the logo since the early 1980s, when he chose it from a book while ordering decals for the football team's helmets. The NFL's Buccaneers joined the league in 1976.{{citation needed|date=July 2019}} However, the Buccaneers withdrew their claim against Beloit College because of the independent decision to redesign the logo.\n\nIn 1992, the Buccaneers introduced orange pants to be worn with the white jerseys. Prior to the team's season finale in 1995 against the [[Detroit Lions|Lions]], coach [[Sam Wyche]] suggested that the Buccaneers wear the orange pants with their orange jerseys.{{citation needed|date=July 2019}} The idea was vetoed by, among others, Pro Bowl linebacker [[Hardy Nickerson]].\n\nFor the 1993 season, following Culverhouse's death, the Buccaneers added a commemorative patch to the right sleeve of their orange away uniforms, which read  \"Mr C\" in cursive script.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bucpower.com/feature-jahimiak.html|title=Collecting game-worn Buccaneer jerseys|author=Jake Jahimiak|date=May 2010|work=Bucpower.com|accessdate=December 28, 2010|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928051240/http://www.bucpower.com/feature-jahimiak.html|archivedate=September 28, 2011|df=}}</ref>\n\n===1997\u20132013===\n[[File:NFCS-Uniform-TB.png|thumb|left|250px|Buccaneer uniforms worn in the [[2012 Tampa Bay Buccaneers season|2012 season]], including the throwback orange uniform]]\n[[File:TBHelmet.jpg|thumbnail|Buccaneer helmet worn from 1997 to 2013]]\nFor the {{nfly|1997}} season, the Buccaneers worked with the NFL to develop a more marketable and intimidating look in order to improve the team's image. The Buccaneers changed their team colors to red, [[pewter]], black, and orange. \"Bucco Bruce\" was replaced by a red wind-swept flag displaying a white pirate skull and crossed [[sabre]]s which is a modified [[Jolly Roger]] (similar to that of [[Calico Jack]]). The flagpole was another larger sabre. The \"Buccaneers\" team name was written in a new font, ''Totally Gothic'', and was either red with shadows of pewter or red and white.

This new color scheme loosely resembled that of the [[Tampa Bay Bandits]], the [[United States Football League|USFL]] team that played in the region during their three-season existence from 1983 to 1985 and had a color scheme of red, silver, black and white.\n\nThe new uniforms provided a combination of either red or white jerseys with either pewter or white trousers. The white-on-white combination has been used numerous times during preseason and early regular season games, while the red-on-white combination has been used much less sparingly. The red-on-white has been used for some prime time home games, and other selected home games. Most games, home and away, have utilized pewter trousers.\n\nIn {{nfly|2003}}, the Buccaneers introduced a practice jersey that featured orange piping. In {{nfly|2004}}, a pewter practice jersey was used, with numerals in the ''Totally Gothic'' font. For 2005, the uniform featured a patch commemorating the club's 30th season.\n\nLike many other NFL teams located in [[subtropical climate]]s, the Buccaneers traditionally wear their white road jerseys at home during the first half of the season \u2013 forcing opponents to wear their darker colors during the hot summers and autumns in Tampa. Additionally, the visitors' bench of Raymond James Stadium is located on the east side of the stadium, which is in direct sunlight for games that kick off at 1:00&nbsp;p.m. [[Eastern Time Zone|Eastern]] games. The west sideline is in the shade. In {{nfly|1989}}, the Buccaneers started to wear white at home to accommodate [[Vinny Testaverde]]'s color blindness.

During the preseason, the Buccaneers usually wear white for their home games. The Buccaneers have worn their red jerseys for all home postseason games except for a January 6, 2008 playoff match up against the [[New York Giants|Giants]]. The Buccaneers wore white that day instead, as the temperature that day was unseasonably high. At [[Super Bowl XXXVII]], in which Tampa Bay was the designated home team, they elected to wear their red home jerseys.

Rives]] works as the sideline reporter.\n\nBroadcast legend and former Green Bay Packers' announcer [[Ray Scott (sportscaster)|Ray Scott]] was the play-by-play man for the Bucs' first two seasons in 1976 and 1977. [[Dick Crippen]] called the team's games in the first half of the 1978 season, with Jim Gallogly taking over for the second half. From 1979 to 1988 [[Mark Champion]], who became the radio voice of the Detroit Lions (1989\u20132004) and then the Detroit Pistons (2001\u2013present), held that position with the Bucs.\n\nFormer Buccaneer [[Hardy Nickerson]] served as color commentator for one season in 2006, until he signed with the [[Chicago Bears|Bears]] as a linebackers coach on February 23, 2007. Nickerson had replaced [[Scot Brantley]], who was the commentator from 1999 through 2005. [[Jesse Ventura]], the famous [[professional wrestler]], [[actor]], and former [[governor of Minnesota]], was Deckerhoff's partner on the Bucs radio broadcasts for one year, 1990, and former Buc [[David Logan (American football)|David Logan]] held that position after Ventura until his death after the 1998 season.

The great majority of games are aired on [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] owned-and-operated stations WTVT and WOFL, by virtue of Fox owning the rights to NFC games. WTSP and WKMG air any Buccaneers home games against [[American Football Conference]] teams.

Both Myers and Lynch worked nationally with Fox Sports at the time until Lynch became the general manager of the [[San Francisco 49ers]] in 2017. [[Ron Jaworski]] previously served as color commentator, until he signed with ''[[Monday Night Football]]'' for 2007. [[Charles Davis (defensive back)|Charles Davis]] also served as color commentator from 2007 to 2008.\n\n[[WTOG]] channel 44 also previously broadcast Buccaneers preseason games for many years, ending in 2002.

The Buccaneers compete in the [[National Football League]] (NFL) as a member club of the league's [[National Football Conference]] (NFC) [[NFC South|South]] division. The club joined the NFL in {{nfly|1976}} as an [[expansion team]], along with the [[Seattle Seahawks]]. Tampa Bay played its first season in the [[American Football Conference]] (AFC) [[AFC West|West]] division as part of the 1976 expansion plan, whereby each new franchise would play every other franchise over the first two years. After the season, the team switched conferences with the Seahawks and became a member of the [[NFC North|NFC Central]] division. During the 2002 league realignment, the Buccaneers joined three former [[NFC West]] teams to form the NFC South. The club is owned by the [[Malcolm Glazer|Glazer family]], and plays its home games at [[Raymond James Stadium]] in Tampa.\n\nThe Buccaneers are the first post-[[AFL\u2013NFL merger|merger]] [[expansion team]] to win a division championship, a playoff game, and to host and play in a conference championship game; all three accomplishments occurred during the [[1979 NFL season|1979 season]]. They are also the first team since the merger to complete a winning season when starting 10 or more rookies, which happened in the 2010 season.  In 1976 and 1977, the Buccaneers lost their first 26 games. They would not win their first game in franchise history until Week 13, of 14, in 1977. After a brief winning era in the late 1970s and early 1980s, the team suffered through 14 consecutive losing seasons. Then, for a 10-year period, they were consistent playoff contenders and won [[Super Bowl XXXVII]] at the end of the [[2002 NFL season|2002 season]], but have not yet returned to the Super Bowl.\n\n==\"Tampa Bay\"==\nThe name [[Tampa Bay Area|\"Tampa Bay\"]] is often used to describe a geographic metropolitan area which encompasses the cities around the body of water known as [[Tampa Bay]], including [[Tampa, Florida|Tampa]], [[St. Petersburg, Florida|St. Petersburg]], [[Clearwater, Florida|Clearwater]] and several smaller cities. Unlike in the case of [[Green Bay, Wisconsin]], there is no municipality known as \"Tampa Bay\". The \"Tampa Bay\" in the names of local professional sports franchises, such as the Buccaneers, [[Tampa Bay Lightning|Lightning]], [[Tampa Bay Rays|Rays]], [[Tampa Bay Rowdies|Rowdies]], and the former [[Tampa Bay Storm|Storm]] and [[Tampa Bay Mutiny|Mutiny]], denotes that they represent the entire region, not just the city of Tampa.\n\n==Franchise history==\n{{main|History of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers}}\n\n===1976\u20131978===\n<!-- [[WP:NFCC]] violation: [[File:John McKay (American football).jpg|thumbnail|[[John McKay (American football)|John McKay]] was the team's first coach from 1976 to 1984.]] -->\nThe Buccaneers joined the NFL as members of the [[AFC West]] in 1976. The following year, they were moved to the [[NFC North|NFC Central]], while the other 1976 expansion team, the [[Seattle Seahawks]], switched conferences with Tampa Bay and joined the AFC West. This realignment was dictated by the league as part of the 1976 expansion plan, so that both teams could play each other twice and every other NFL franchise once during their first two seasons. Instead of a traditional schedule of playing each division opponent twice, the Buccaneers played every conference team once, plus the Seahawks.<ref>{{cite news|title=The Answer Man, Series 2, Vol. 18|url=https://www.buccaneers.com/news/the-answer-man-series-2-vol-18-2145514|publisher=NFL Enterprises, LLC|website=Buccaneers.com|date=June 20, 2005|access-date=June 30, 2019}}</ref>\n\nTampa Bay did not win their first game until the 13th week of their [[1977 Tampa Bay Buccaneers season|second season]], starting with a record of 0\u201326 (though the Bucs had beaten the [[1976 Atlanta Falcons season|Atlanta Falcons]], 17\u20133, in a 1976 pre-season game before their first regular season).<ref>Underwood, John. \"A Three-hour Time Difference\".

In the first, [[STP (motor oil company)|STP]] was put all over the goal posts in Tampa to prevent the goalposts from being ripped down in the event of a celebration. Four blocked kicks later, the Bucs wasted the oily substance, falling to the [[1979 Minnesota Vikings season|Minnesota Vikings]] 23\u201322. STP was wasted again the following week as the Bucs were shut out 14\u20130 by the [[1979 Chicago Bears season|Chicago Bears]], and in [[O. J. Simpson]]'s final home game in [[1979 San Francisco 49ers season|San Francisco]], Tampa Bay lost its third straight attempt to clinch a division title against a 49ers team which came in with a 1\u201313 record. However, in the season finale at home against the [[1979 Kansas City Chiefs season|Kansas City Chiefs]], which was played in the worst downpour in Bucs history, Tampa Bay pulled out a 3\u20130 victory. Finishing with a 10\u20136 record, the Bucs had their first winning season in franchise history, and won the Central Division in a tiebreaker over the Bears. In an upset, the Bucs defeated the [[1979 Philadelphia Eagles season|Philadelphia Eagles]] 24\u201317 in the divisional round of the [[NFL playoffs, 1979-80|playoffs]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://dynamic.si.cnn.com/si_online/covers/issues/1980/0107.html|title=SI.com \u2013 Sports Illustrated Covers \u2013 January 7, 1980|publisher=|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070612064908/http://dynamic.si.cnn.com/si_online/covers/issues/1980/0107.html|archivedate=June 12, 2007|df=}}</ref> Because the [[1979 Los Angeles Rams season|Los Angeles Rams]] defeated the [[1979 Dallas Cowboys season|Dallas Cowboys]] in the other NFC playoff game, the Bucs hosted the [[NFC Championship Game]] the following week in Tampa. The Bucs lost to the Rams 9\u20130. In their fourth season, the Bucs seemed on the verge of fulfilling McKay's five-year plan.\n\nThe Bucs made the playoffs again by winning their division in the [[1981 Tampa Bay Buccaneers season|1981 season]]. It came down to a thrilling final game at [[1981 Detroit Lions season|Detroit]]; the winner would take the Central Division crown and the loser would miss the playoffs. The Lions had not lost at home all season. Although the Bucs trailed early, an 84-yard touchdown bomb from QB Williams to WR [[Kevin House]] and a fumble recovery for a touchdown by DT [[David Logan (American football)|David Logan]] sealed the win for the Bucs. In the playoffs, the [[1981 Dallas Cowboys season|Dallas Cowboys]] defeated the Bucs, 38\u20130, in the divisional round.\n\nThe [[1982 Tampa Bay Buccaneers season|1982 season]] started 0\u20133 for the Bucs, before a [[1982 NFL Players Strike|player's strike]] shut down the NFL for seven weeks. When the league resumed play, the Bucs were nicknamed the \"Cardiac Kids\" for winning five of their next six games, all in the final moments, to go 5\u20134 and qualify for the expanded playoff slate. In the first round, the Bucs once again faced the [[1982 Dallas Cowboys season|Cowboys]] at Dallas, losing 30\u201317. As it turned out, this would be the last winning regular season under Culverhouse's ownership.\n\n===1983\u20131996===\nBefore the 1983 season, Williams bolted to the [[United States Football League]] in a salary dispute. The Bucs lost their first nine games of the 1983 season en route to finishing 2\u201314, the first of 12 consecutive seasons with at least ten losses\u2014an NFL record. Included was the drafting of [[Heisman Trophy]] winner [[Bo Jackson]] with the first pick in the [[1986 NFL Draft|1986 draft]]. Jackson had let it be known that he would never play a down for Hugh Culverhouse at Tampa Bay. Making good on his threat, he opted instead to play baseball for the [[Kansas City Royals]] and would later return for parts of football seasons with the [[Oakland Raiders|Los Angeles Raiders]]. Along with Williams, who later was a Super Bowl champion QB for Washington, two other Buc quarterbacks during this era led other teams to Super Bowl wins. [[Steve Young]] won with the 49ers and [[Trent Dilfer]] won with the Baltimore Ravens.\n\nUnder Culverhouse, the Bucs were one of the NFL's more profitable teams during the 1980s; however, this was largely because he kept the payroll among the lowest in the league, hampering their ability to sign quality players. Attendance also sagged; at one point the Buccaneers went parts of three whole seasons without having a home game televised locally, and when they did it was more attributed to a strong visiting team with a large following in the area, such as the Chicago Bears or Green Bay Packers.\n\n[[Hardy Nickerson]], a future 5-time Pro Bowl linebacker, signed as a free agent from the Pittsburgh Steelers. [[John Lynch (American football)|John Lynch]], a future Pro Bowl strong safety, was drafted in 1993. In the [[1995 NFL draft]] the Buccaneers drafted two future Hall of Famers: [[Warren Sapp]] and [[Derrick Brooks]]. Pro Bowl Fullback, [[Mike Alstott]], was drafted the next year in the 1996 draft.\n\n===1994\u20131996===\nDespite the profitability of the Buccaneers in the 1980s, Culverhouse's death in 1994 revealed a team close to [[bankruptcy]], which surprised many observers.{{Citation needed|date=December 2015}} His son, [[Miami]] attorney Hugh Culverhouse Jr., practically forced{{Citation needed|date=December 2015}} the trustees of his father's estate to sell the team, which cast doubt on the future of the franchise in Tampa. Interested parties included [[New York Yankees]] owner [[George Steinbrenner]] and [[Baltimore Orioles]] owner [[Peter Angelos]], the latter of whom publicly declared he would move the team to [[Baltimore]], as the city did not have an NFL franchise at that time.\n\nHowever, in a last-minute surprise, real estate magnate [[Malcolm Glazer]] outbid both of them for $192 million, the highest sale price for a professional sports franchise up to that point. Glazer immediately placed his sons [[Bryan Glazer|Bryan]], [[Edward Glazer|Edward]], and [[Joel Glazer|Joel]] in charge of the team's financial affairs. He stated that he had every intention of keeping the team in Tampa, but informed area citizens its current stadium deal would not support the record paid amount and that a new stadium would be required. The Glazers convinced [[Hillsborough County, Florida|Hillsborough County]] voters to raise sales taxes to fund the construction of what would become [[Raymond James Stadium]].\n\nThe Glazers' deep pockets and serious commitment to fielding a winning team\u2013in Tampa Bay\u2013finally allowed the Bucs to become competitive. The team's performance dramatically improved when the Glazers hired Minnesota Vikings defensive coordinator [[Tony Dungy]] as head coach, jettisoned the old uniform designs (see below).\n\n===1996\u20132001: Tony Dungy era===\nDuring [[1996 Tampa Bay Buccaneers season|Dungy's first season in 1996]], the team continued to struggle, starting the season 1\u20138. But in the second half of the season they finished 5\u20132, primarily due to the performance of a defense ranked seventh in the NFL led by [[Hardy Nickerson]] and the maturing of Sam Wyche's draftees Brooks, Lynch, and Sapp. Dungy, with his even-tempered personality, quickly brought balance and morale to the team, and his [[Football coverage shells#Cover 2|Cover 2]] defensive scheme, sharpened to perfection by [[defensive coordinator]] [[Monte Kiffin]] and linebackers coach [[Lovie Smith]], became the foundation for Tampa Bay's future success.<ref>{{cite news|title=Tony Dungy to Join Buccaneers Ring of Honor|url=https://www.buccaneers.com/news/tony-dungy-to-join-buccaneers-ring-of-honor-20639092|publisher=NFL Enterprises, LLC|website=Buccaneers.com|date=February 4, 2019|access-date=June 30, 2019}}</ref> Their version of Cover 2 was so successful that it became known as the [[Tampa 2]].<ref>{{cite news|last=Varley|first=Teresa|title=Tony Dungy credits Chuck Noll with his defensive philosophy|url=http://news.steelers.com/article/73586/|publisher=NFL Enterprises, LLC|website=Steelers.com|date=January 31, 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070209171311/http://news.steelers.com/article/73586/|archive-date=February 9, 2007|access-date=June 30, 2019|url-status=dead}}</ref> It has been brought to the [[Chicago Bears]] by Smith, [[Detroit Lions]] by Rod Marinelli, [[Kansas City Chiefs]] by [[Herman Edwards]] and to the [[Indianapolis Colts]] by Dungy himself, and copied by several other teams.\n\nThe team started the [[1997 Tampa Bay Buccaneers season|1997 season]] 5\u20130, picking up where they left off the previous year, and this quick start once again landed them on the cover of ''Sports Illustrated'' twice.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://dynamic.si.cnn.com/si_online/covers/issues/1997/0908.html|title=SI.com \u2013 Sports Illustrated Covers \u2013 September 8, 1997|publisher=|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070212122458/http://dynamic.si.cnn.com/si_online/covers/issues/1997/0908.html|archivedate=February 12, 2007|df=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://dynamic.si.cnn.com/si_online/covers/issues/1997/0929.html|title=SI.com \u2013 September 29, 1997|publisher=|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070212122508/http://dynamic.si.cnn.com/si_online/covers/issues/1997/0929.html|archivedate=February 12, 2007|df=}}</ref>  The Bucs went 10\u20136 for their first winning season and playoff appearance since 1982, as a wild-card team.

They lost at [[Lambeau Field]] to the eventual NFC champion [[1997 Green Bay Packers season|Green Bay Packers]] 21\u20137. Still, there was reason for optimism, and the expectations were high for the following season.\n\nThe [[1998 Tampa Bay Buccaneers season|1998 season]], the first to be played in the newly constructed [[Raymond James Stadium]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://raymondjamesstadium.com/stadium-history/|title=Stadium History \u2013 Raymond James Stadium|author=|date=|website=raymondjamesstadium.com|accessdate=February 4, 2019}}</ref> saw the Bucs lose several close games en route to a disappointing 8\u20138 record. The Bucs had to play the first 6 football games of the year (including preseason) on the road as the new stadium was not quite finished.\n\nThe [[1999 Tampa Bay Buccaneers season|1999 season]] brought much better fortune. On the strength of the NFL's number 3 overall defense and a performance by rookie QB [[Shaun King (American football)|Shaun King]], the Bucs finished the season with an 11\u20135 record and won their third NFC Central Division Championship. They beat [[1999 Washington Redskins season|Washington]] 14\u201313 in the Divisional round, before losing to the eventual Super Bowl Champion [[1999 St. Louis Rams season|St. Louis Rams]] in a low-scoring NFC Championship Game, 11\u20136. The Bucs' loss was controversial, highlighted by the reversal of a pass from King to WR [[Bert Emanuel]], which ended the Bucs' chances at continuing their last-minute drive. In league meetings following the season, the NFL changed the rules regarding what constituted an [[incomplete pass]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/football/nfl/news/2000/03/28/meetings_celebrations_ap/|archiveurl=https://archive.today/20120731052158/http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/football/nfl/news/2000/03/28/meetings_celebrations_ap/|url-status=dead|title=CNNSI.com - NFL Football - NFL competition committee advises reducing\u2026|author=|date=July 31, 2012|archivedate=July 31, 2012|website=archive.is|accessdate=February 4, 2019}}</ref>\n\nWhile the Bucs played well in [[2000 Tampa Bay Buccaneers season|2000]] and [[2001 Tampa Bay Buccaneers season|2001]] and made the playoffs in each season, they were unable to fulfill their primary goal of a Super Bowl victory. The wild card spots that Tampa Bay earned forced them to go on the road for their postseason opener in each year, and both road games took them into frigid Philadelphia to play the Eagles.

Several potential candidates were offered the job, including [[University of Florida]] head coach (and former Buccaneers quarterback) [[Steve Spurrier]], former [[New York Giants]] head coach [[Bill Parcells]], and Baltimore Ravens defensive coordinator [[Marvin Lewis]]. Spurrier jumped to the Redskins when he was offered the most lucrative salary package ever offered to an NFL head coach, and Parcells eventually passed on the Bucs' offer\u2014the second time he had done so in the history of the franchise. Bucs' general manager Rich McKay threw his support behind Lewis. The Glazer brothers were so displeased with the selection of yet another defensive-minded coach that they overruled McKay and took control of the candidate search themselves. They made it clear that their top choice was [[Jon Gruden]]; however, he was still under contract with the [[Oakland Raiders]].\n\nWhile talks with the Raiders were secretly under way, the Glazers publicly pursued another respected offensive mind, [[San Francisco 49ers]] head coach [[Steve Mariucci]].

With a new Tailback, Wide Receiver, Two Tight Ends, Left Tackle, and Left Guard, Gruden put his stamp on the teams offense to remove the term \"Dungy's Team\" label.

Tampa Bay entered the game as heavy underdogs and fell behind early. However, the Bucs persevered and took a ten-point lead into the fourth quarter.

On the same day, the New England Patriots made an agreement to trade Gronkowski to the Buccaneers, along with a seventh-round pick in exchange for a compensatory fourth round pick in the [[2020 NFL Draft]].\n\n==Defense==\nThroughout their history, the Buccaneers have been known for their suffocating defense. It started with the drafting of Hall of Fame defensive end [[Lee Roy Selmon]] with their first pick ever in 1976. Three Buccaneer players have been named the [[AP NFL Defensive Player of the Year Award|AP Defensive Player of the Year]], and the team has led the league in total defense on three occasions. The 2002 Super Bowl Champion Tampa Bay Buccaneers had the number one Defense that year and it was one of the Greatest NFL Defenses of All Time along  with the 1985 Bears, 2000 Ravens and 2015 Broncos. All four of the Buccaneers [[Pro Football Hall of Fame|Hall of Fame]] inductees are defensive players or coaches. \n===1978\u20131982===\nLed by Selmon, Linebackers [[Dewey Selmon]], [[Richard Wood (American football)|Richard Wood]], [[Dave Lewis (linebacker)|Dave Lewis]], and [[Mike Washington]], [[Mark Cotney]], and [[Cedric Brown]] in the secondary, the early years Buccaneers quickly earned an identity as a defensive team. Their 3\u20134 defense peaked in 1979 when they led the league in total defense, points allowed, and first downs allowed. Lee Roy Selmon was voted NFL Defensive Player of the Year, but they eventually fell 10 points short of the [[Super Bowl]] as the offense held them back in the NFC Championship game in a 9\u20130 loss to the [[Los Angeles Rams]].\n\n===1997\u20132008: The Tampa 2===\n{{main|Tampa 2}}\nThe team drafted franchise cornerstones [[John Lynch (American football)|John Lynch]] in 1993, and [[Warren Sapp]] and [[Derrick Brooks]] in 1995 to go along with All-Pro linebacker [[Hardy Nickerson]]. That was followed by the hiring of innovative defensive coordinator [[Monte Kiffin]] in 1996. The new-look Buccaneers set the stage for one of the greatest defensive runs in NFL history. From 1997 to 2008, the Buccaneers defense finished in the league's top ten every year but one, including eight top-5 finishes, and two top-ranked efforts. Kiffin along with head coach [[Tony Dungy]] created the \"[[Tampa 2]]\" defense, a modified version of the established [[Cover 2]] scheme.\n\nKiffin's defenses were known as gang tacklers with tremendous team speed with a front four that could pressure the quarterback consistently, fast sideline-to-sideline linebackers, and a hard-hitting secondary that caused turnovers. Many teams have copied the Tampa 2, but none have come close to the success the Buccaneers experienced led by numerous Pro Bowlers and Hall of Famers. The Tampa Bay defense featured future Hall of Famers, [[Derrick Brooks]] and [[Warren Sapp]], and Pro Bowlers, [[John Lynch (American football)|John Lynch]], [[Ronde Barber]], [[Hardy Nickerson]], [[Simeon Rice]], [[Shelton Quarles]], [[Donnie Abraham]], and [[Super Bowl XXXVII]] MVP [[Dexter Jackson (safety)|Dexter Jackson]]. Sapp and Nickerson were named to the [[National Football League 1990s All-Decade Team|1990s All-Decade 2nd Team]] while the [[National Football League 2000s All-Decade Team|2000s All-Decade Team]] featured Sapp and Brooks as 1st Team players and Ronde Barber on the 2nd Team.\n\n====2002 defense====\n[[File:Tampabaybucsplayersreunion.JPG|thumb|175px|Players from the 2002 team along with head coach Jon Gruden]]\nThe 2002 Buccaneers defense is widely regarded as one of the greatest defenses in NFL history, rivaled only by the 2000 Ravens, 1985 Bears, 2015 Broncos, 1976 Steelers, and few others. In the regular season Tampa Bay led the league in total defense (252.8 ypg), points allowed (196), first downs allowed (14.8 pg), passing (155.6 ypg), interceptions (31), interceptions returned for touchdowns (5), opponent passer rating (48.4), and shutouts (2). They also finished third in opponent rushing average (3.8 ypc), and sixth in sacks (43). [[Derrick Brooks]] was awarded AP Defensive Player of the Year as the defense led the way to a 12\u20134 regular season. The team was even better in the postseason allowing only 37 points in three games combined \u2013 all against top ten offenses. In those three playoff games, they intercepted 9 passes \u2013 returning 4 for touchdowns \u2013 and collected 11 sacks.\n\nIn [[Super Bowl XXXVII]], the Buccaneers delivered one of the most impressive defensive performances in Super Bowl history. Playing against the #1 offense in the league led by league MVP [[Rich Gannon]], the defense actually outscored the [[Oakland Raiders|Raiders]] offense, allowing 2 offensive touchdowns while returning 3 interceptions for touchdowns. The defense set two records in the 48\u201321 blowout, one for most interceptions in a Super Bowl (5), and one for most interceptions returned for touchdowns in a Super Bowl (3). In 19 total games in 2002, the Buccaneers recorded 40 interceptions, 53 sacks, and 9 defensive touchdowns.\n\n==Team facilities==\n{{multiple image\n | align = right\n | direction = horizontal\n | header =\n | header_align = left/right/center\n | header_background =\n | footer =\n | footer_align = left/right/center\n | footer_background = \n | width =\n | image1 = Tampa Stadium1.jpg\n | width1 = 227\n | caption1 = [[Tampa Stadium]], where the Buccaneers played for their first 22 seasons\n | image2 = Raymond James Stadium01.jpg\n | width2 = 201\n | caption2 = [[Raymond James Stadium]], where the Buccaneers play\n}}\nSince 1998 the Buccaneers have played their home games at [[Raymond James Stadium]] in Tampa. Prior to that they played in [[Tampa Stadium]] since their establishment.\n\nIn 1975, the Buccaneers built a small practice complex with offices near [[Tampa International Airport]] called One Buccaneer Place  - often shorted to \"One Buc Place\". The team utilized the unspectacular facility through the 1990s and into the early 2000s. As other NFL clubs began replacing and upgrading their respective facilities, Buccaneers players and coaches stepped up their complaints about the constant aircraft noise, cramped offices, small locker rooms, and decrepit condition of One Buc Place. Then-head coach Jon Gruden sarcastically referred to the facility as \"The Woodshed\", and some of the coaches' offices were actually converted broom [[closet]]s.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.sptimes.com/2006/08/18/news_pf/Bucs/Time_to_say_goodbye.shtml|title=Time to say goodbye|publisher=St. Pete Times|first=Rick|last=Stroud|date=August 18, 2006|access-date=October 2, 2017}}</ref> For much of the team's existence, the Buccaneers held [[Training camp (National Football League)|training camp]] on the [[University of Tampa]] campus, then at the expansive and better-equipped [[ESPN Wide World of Sports Complex|Disney's Wide World of Sports Complex]] near Orlando (2002\u20132008).\n\n[[File:Raymond James Stadium03.jpg|thumb|175px|The pirate ship at Raymond James Stadium]]\nIn August 2006, the Buccaneers unveiled a new $30 million training facility. Conveniently located across the street from [[Raymond James Stadium]] (on the former site of [[Tampa Bay Center]]), the state-of-the-art ({{convert|145000|sqft|adj=on}} facility on {{convert|33|acre}}) is one of the largest in the NFL. Its features include offices and meeting rooms, three natural grass practice fields, a theater for meetings and press conferences, an expanded weight room, a fully equipped kitchen and dining room, a rehabilitation center with three separate pools and a locker room twice the size of the former location. The building is capped off with a five-story glass and steel football as a key design element. An indoor practice field, featuring artificial turf, was completed in 2017. In 2009, the team began holding training camp at the new upgraded facilities in Tampa.\n\nIn the second week of September 2007, statues of important figures from the Bucs 2002 championship season were moved into the lobby area in an exhibit called \"Moment of Victory\". The life-size statues included players [[Mike Alstott]], [[Ronde Barber]], [[Derrick Brooks]], [[Brad Johnson (American football)|Brad Johnson]], [[John Lynch (American football)|John Lynch]], [[Shelton Quarles]], [[Simeon Rice]], [[Warren Sapp]], and head coach [[Jon Gruden]]. The statues are modeled after images from the sideline towards the end of [[Super Bowl XXXVII]].<ref>{{cite news|last=Stroud|first=Rick|title=Bucs' moment of victory is permanently set|url=http://www.sptimes.com/2007/09/18/Bucs/_Bucs__moment_of_vict.shtml|newspaper=Tampa Bay Times|date=September 18, 2007|access-date=September 18, 2016}}</ref>\n\nInitially, the facility might have been unnamed, but for over a decade, it simply was referred to as \"One Buc Place\", utilizing the same name as the old building. In 2018, the facility was officially named AdventHealth Training Center, as part of a ten-year naming rights deal with [[Adventist Health System|AdventHealth]] (formerly [[Florida Hospital]]).<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.pewterreport.com/bucs-team-up-with-advent-health-on-new-facility-naming-rights/|title=Bucs Team Up With AdventHealth On New Facility Naming Rights|publisher=Pewter Reports|first=Mark|last=Cook|date=August 27, 2018|access-date=August 29, 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Logos and uniforms==\n\n===1976\u20131996===\nWhen the team began play in 1976, Culverhouse initially picked team colors of red, green, orange and white. However, the shade of green was too close to the teal that used by the [[Miami Dolphins]]. A medium shade of \"Florida Orange\" was substituted for green. Home uniforms included orange jerseys with white numerals outlined in red\u2014the now-infamous \"[[Creamsicle]]\" uniforms. Road white jerseys originally had orange numerals outlined in red, but these colors were reversed for year two and beyond. The color swap provided better visibility, especially for television coverage purposes.\n\nLong-time ''[[Tampa Tribune]]'' cartoonist and [[Ye Mystic Krewe of Gasparilla]] member [[Lamar Sparkman]] designed the first team logo.<ref>Gershman, Rick. \"101 Gasparilla\".

[[Beloit College]], located in Beloit, Wisconsin, received a notice from the Tampa Bay Buccaneers of the college's illegitimate use of their mascot. Beloit College's buccaneer is the mirror image of the Tampa Bay buccaneer, with the creamsicle colors replaced with Beloit's school colors.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mascotdb.com/team.php?id=40206 |title=Beloit College Buccaneers |publisher=MASCOTdb.com |date= |access-date=September 3, 2012}}</ref> Athletic Director Ed DeGeorge said Beloit's Buccaneers have used the logo since the early 1980s, when he chose it from a book while ordering decals for the football team's helmets. The NFL's Buccaneers joined the league in 1976.{{citation needed|date=July 2019}} However, the Buccaneers withdrew their claim against Beloit College because of the independent decision to redesign the logo.\n\nIn 1992, the Buccaneers introduced orange pants to be worn with the white jerseys. Prior to the team's season finale in 1995 against the [[Detroit Lions|Lions]], coach [[Sam Wyche]] suggested that the Buccaneers wear the orange pants with their orange jerseys.{{citation needed|date=July 2019}} The idea was vetoed by, among others, Pro Bowl linebacker [[Hardy Nickerson]].\n\nFor the 1993 season, following Culverhouse's death, the Buccaneers added a commemorative patch to the right sleeve of their orange away uniforms, which read  \"Mr C\" in cursive script.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bucpower.com/feature-jahimiak.html|title=Collecting game-worn Buccaneer jerseys|author=Jake Jahimiak|date=May 2010|work=Bucpower.com|accessdate=December 28, 2010|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928051240/http://www.bucpower.com/feature-jahimiak.html|archivedate=September 28, 2011|df=}}</ref>\n\n===1997\u20132013===\n[[File:NFCS-Uniform-TB.png|thumb|left|250px|Buccaneer uniforms worn in the [[2012 Tampa Bay Buccaneers season|2012 season]], including the throwback orange uniform]]\n[[File:TBHelmet.jpg|thumbnail|Buccaneer helmet worn from 1997 to 2013]]\nFor the {{nfly|1997}} season, the Buccaneers worked with the NFL to develop a more marketable and intimidating look in order to improve the team's image. The Buccaneers changed their team colors to red, [[pewter]], black, and orange. \"Bucco Bruce\" was replaced by a red wind-swept flag displaying a white pirate skull and crossed [[sabre]]s which is a modified [[Jolly Roger]] (similar to that of [[Calico Jack]]). The flagpole was another larger sabre. The \"Buccaneers\" team name was written in a new font, ''Totally Gothic'', and was either red with shadows of pewter or red and white.

This new color scheme loosely resembled that of the [[Tampa Bay Bandits]], the [[United States Football League|USFL]] team that played in the region during their three-season existence from 1983 to 1985 and had a color scheme of red, silver, black and white.\n\nThe new uniforms provided a combination of either red or white jerseys with either pewter or white trousers. The white-on-white combination has been used numerous times during preseason and early regular season games, while the red-on-white combination has been used much less sparingly. The red-on-white has been used for some prime time home games, and other selected home games. Most games, home and away, have utilized pewter trousers.\n\nIn {{nfly|2003}}, the Buccaneers introduced a practice jersey that featured orange piping. In {{nfly|2004}}, a pewter practice jersey was used, with numerals in the ''Totally Gothic'' font. For 2005, the uniform featured a patch commemorating the club's 30th season.\n\nLike many other NFL teams located in [[subtropical climate]]s, the Buccaneers traditionally wear their white road jerseys at home during the first half of the season \u2013 forcing opponents to wear their darker colors during the hot summers and autumns in Tampa. Additionally, the visitors' bench of Raymond James Stadium is located on the east side of the stadium, which is in direct sunlight for games that kick off at 1:00&nbsp;p.m. [[Eastern Time Zone|Eastern]] games. The west sideline is in the shade. In {{nfly|1989}}, the Buccaneers started to wear white at home to accommodate [[Vinny Testaverde]]'s color blindness.

During the preseason, the Buccaneers usually wear white for their home games. The Buccaneers have worn their red jerseys for all home postseason games except for a January 6, 2008 playoff match up against the [[New York Giants|Giants]]. The Buccaneers wore white that day instead, as the temperature that day was unseasonably high. At [[Super Bowl XXXVII]], in which Tampa Bay was the designated home team, they elected to wear their red home jerseys.

[[Dick Crippen]] called the team's games in the first half of the 1978 season, with Jim Gallogly taking over for the second half. From 1979 to 1988 [[Mark Champion]], who became the radio voice of the Detroit Lions (1989\u20132004) and then the Detroit Pistons (2001\u2013present), held that position with the Bucs.\n\nFormer Buccaneer [[Hardy Nickerson]] served as color commentator for one season in 2006, until he signed with the [[Chicago Bears|Bears]] as a linebackers coach on February 23, 2007.

A part of the Slavic Greeks also migrated to Australia, the United States and Canada.

All Macedonian language printing stopped and the language was no longer taught in Bulgaria.\n\nThe existence of a Macedonian language and Macedonian ethnos is highly disputed in Bulgaria. Most Bulgarians do not recognize the Macedonian language as a separate language and assert that it is a dialect of Bulgarian. There are two dialects in Bulgaria which are considered Macedonian in North Macedonia: the [[Male\u0161evo-Pirin dialect|Male\u0161evo-Pirin]] (widely spoken in most of [[Blagoevgrad Province]] in Bulgaria and [[Del\u010devo]] region in the Republic of Macedonia) and the [[Ser-Drama-Lagadin-Nevrokop dialect|Ser-Drama-Lagadin-Nevrokop]] ones.

This bread is often referred to as whole-wheat but in fact is not: the flour used is mostly so-called ''grey flour'' of 85% extraction (meaning that some but not all of the wheat bran is retained).

The Entente promised the region of [[Transylvania]] (which was part of Austria-Hungary) in return for Romanian support. The Romanian Army [[Battle of Transylvania|invaded Transylvania]] and had initial successes, but was forced to stop and was pushed back by the Germans and Austro-Hungarians when Bulgaria attacked them in the south. Meanwhile, a [[February Revolution|revolution]] occurred in Russia in February 1917 (one of the several causes being the hardships of the war). Tsar Nicholas II was forced to abdicate and a [[Russian Provisional Government]] was founded, with [[Georgy Lvov]] as its first leader, who was eventually replaced by [[Alexander Kerensky]].\n\nThe newly formed [[Russian Republic]] continued to fight the war alongside Romania and the rest of the Entente until it was [[October Revolution|overthrown]] by the [[Bolsheviks]] in October 1917. Kerensky oversaw the [[Kerensky Offensive|July Offensive]], which was largely a failure and caused a collapse in the Russian Army. The [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|new government]] established by the Bolsheviks signed the [[Treaty of Brest-Litovsk]] with the Central Powers, taking it out of the war and making large territorial concessions. Romania was also forced to surrender and signed a [[Treaty of Bucharest (1918)|similar treaty]], though both of the treaties were nullified with the surrender of the Central Powers in November 1918.\n\n== Geography ==\nThe front in the east was much longer than that in the west. The theater of war was roughly delimited by the [[Baltic Sea]] in the west and [[Minsk]] in the east, and [[Saint Petersburg]] in the north and the [[Black Sea]] in the south, a distance of more than {{convert|1600|km|mi}}. This had a drastic effect on the nature of the warfare.\n[[File:Timeline of WWI Eastern Front.jpg|thumb|580px|A timeline of events on the [[Eastern Front (World War I)|Eastern]] and [[Middle-Eastern theatre of World War I|Middle-Eastern]] theatres of World War I]]\n\nWhile the war on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]] developed into [[trench warfare]], the battle lines on the Eastern Front were much more fluid and trenches never truly developed. This was because the greater length of the front ensured that the density of soldiers in the line was lower so the line was easier to break. Once broken, the sparse communication networks made it difficult for the defender to rush reinforcements to the rupture in the line, mounting rapid counteroffensives to seal off any breakthrough.\n\n== Propaganda ==\nPropaganda was a key component of the culture of World War I. It was most commonly deployed through the state-controlled media to glorify the homeland and demonize the enemy. Propaganda often took the form of images which portrayed stereotypes from folklore about the enemy or from glorified moments from the nation's history. On the Eastern Front, propaganda took many forms such as opera, film, spy fiction, theater, spectacle, war novels and graphic art. Across the Eastern Front the amount of propaganda used in each country varied from state to state. Propaganda took many forms within each country and was distributed by many different groups. Most commonly the state produced propaganda, but other groups, such as anti-war organizations, also generated propaganda.<ref>{{cite book|editor1-last=Roshwald|editor1-first=Aviel|editor2-last=Stites|editor2-first=Richard|title=European Culture in the Great War:The Arts, Entertainment and Propaganda 1914\u20131918|url=https://books.google.com/?id=uteV3ytfmqQC&pg=PA176&lpg=PA176&dq=European+Culture+in+the+Great+War#v=onepage&q=European%20Culture%20in%20the%20Great%20War&f=false|year=1999|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|location=Cambridge|pages=6,349\u2013358|isbn=978-0-521-01324-6}}</ref>\n\n== Initial situation in belligerent countries ==\n=== Germany ===\n{{Main|German entry into World War I}}\nPrior to the outbreak of war, German strategy was based almost entirely on the so-called [[Schlieffen Plan]]. With the [[Franco-Russian Alliance|Franco-Russian Agreement]] in place, Germany knew that war with either of these combatants would result in war with the other, which meant that there would be war in both the west and the east. Therefore, the German General Staff, under Alfred von Schlieffen and then [[Helmuth von Moltke the Younger]], planned a quick, all-out ground war on the Western Front to take France and, upon victory, Germany would turn its attention to Russia in the east.\n\nSchlieffen believed Russia would not be ready or willing to move against and attack Germany due to the huge losses of military equipment that Russia had suffered in the [[Russo-Japanese war]] of 1904\u20131905, its low population density and lack of railroads.\n\nConversely, the German Navy believed it could be victorious over Britain with Russian neutrality, something which Moltke knew would not be possible.\n\n=== Romania ===\n[[File:Greater Rumania, New York Times, 1919.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|Border changes in favor of Romania as stipulated in the [[Treaty of Bucharest (1916)|Treaty of Bucharest]]]]\nIn the immediate years preceding the [[First World War]], the Kingdom of Romania was involved in the [[Second Balkan War]] on the side of Serbia, Montenegro, Greece and the Ottoman Empire against Bulgaria. The [[Treaty of Bucharest (1913)|Treaty of Bucharest]], signed on August 10, 1913, ended the Balkan conflict and added 6,960 square kilometers to Romania's territory.<ref>{{cite book|last=Miller, William|title=The Balkans: Roumania, Bulgaria, Serbia and Montenegro|year=1922|publisher=T. Fisher Unwin Ltd|location=London|page=474}}</ref> Although militarized, Romania decided upon a policy of neutrality at the start of the First World War, mainly due to having territorial interests in both Austria-Hungary ([[Transylvania]] and [[Bukovina]]) and in Russia ([[Bessarabia]]). Strong cultural influences also affected Romanian leanings, however. King [[Carol I]], as a [[Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen]], favoured his Germanic roots, while the Romanian people, influenced by their Orthodox church and Latin-based language, were inclined to join France. Perhaps King Carol's attempts at joining the war on the side of the Central powers would have been fruitful had he not died in 1914, but Romanian disenchantment with Austria-Hungary had already influenced public and political opinion. French endorsement of Romanian action against Bulgaria, and support of the terms of the Treaty of Bucharest was particularly effective at inclining Romania towards the Entente. Furthermore, Russian courting of Romanian sympathies, exemplified by the visit of the Tsar to [[Constan\u021ba]] on June 14, 1914, signaled in a new era of positive relations between the two countries.<ref>{{cite book|last=Hitchins, Keith|title=Rumania:1866\u20131947|year=1994|publisher=Clarendon Press|location=Oxford|pages=153\u20134}}</ref> Nevertheless, King [[Ferdinand I of Romania|Ferdinand I]] of Romania maintained a policy of neutrality, intending to gain the most for Romania by negotiating between competing powers. The result of the negotiations with the Entente was the [[Treaty of Bucharest (1916)]], which stipulated the conditions under which Romania agreed to join the war on the side of the Entente, particularly territorial promises in [[Austria-Hungary]]: Transylvania, [[Cri\u0219ana]] and [[Maramure\u0219 (historical region)|Maramure\u0219]], the whole [[Banat]] and most of Bukovina. According to historian John Keegan, these enticements offered by the Allies were never concrete, for in secret, Russia and France agreed not to honor any conventions when the end of the war came.<ref>{{cite book|last=Keegan, John|title=the First World War|year=1998|publisher=Random House Inc.|location=New York|pages=306}}</ref>\n\n=== Russia ===\n{{Main|Russian entry into World War I}}\nThe immediate reason for Russia's involvement in the First World War was a direct result of the decisions made by the statesmen and generals during July 1914. The [[July crisis]] was the culmination of a series of diplomatic conflicts that took place in the decades prior to 1914, and this is fundamental to an understanding of Russia's position immediately prior to the War. According to [[Dominic Lieven|D. C. Lieven]], Russia was formidable and was able to back up her diplomatic policies with force. One of the most significant factors in bringing Russia to the brink of war was the downfall of her economy.{{Sfn|Lieven|1983|p=5}} The 20 percent jump in defense expenditure during 1866\u201377 and in 1871-5 forced them to change their position within Europe and shift the balance of power out of her favour.{{Sfn|Lieven|1983|p=8}} At the time, Russian infrastructure was backward and the Russian government had to invest far more than its European rivals in structural changes. In addition there were overwhelming burdens of defense, which would ultimately result in an economic downfall for the Russians. This was a major strain on the Russian population, but also served as a direct threat to military expenditure.{{Sfn|Lieven|1983|p=27}} Thus the only way the Russians could sustain the strains of European war would be to place more emphasis on foreign investment from the French who essentially came to Russia's aid for industrial change.{{Sfn|Lieven|1983|p=28}} The [[Franco-Russian Alliance]] allowed for the Russian defense to grow and aid the European balance of power during the growth of the German Empire's might. Nevertheless, one of the key factors was that of the Russian foreign policy between 1890 and 1914.\n\n==== Russian propaganda ====\n[[File:\u0412\u043e\u0435\u043d\u043d\u044b\u044f \u043a\u0430\u0440\u0438\u043a\u0430\u0442\u0443\u0440\u044b.jpg|thumb|upright|World War I caricature from Russia depicting [[Wilhelm II, German Emperor|Wilhelm II]], [[Franz Joseph I of Austria|Franz Joseph I]] and [[Mehmed V]].

Their main aim was to help overcome the legend of the \"invincible\" German war machine, in order to boost the morale of civilians and soldiers. Russian propaganda often took the form of showing the Germans as a civilized nation, with barbaric \"inhuman\" traits. Russian propaganda also exploited the image of the Russian [[POW]]s who were in the German camps, again in order to boost the morale of their troops, serving as encouragement to defeat the enemy and to get their fellow soldiers out of the \"inhuman\" German POW camps.<ref name=\"oxana475\">{{cite journal|last=Oxana Nagornaja|first=Jeffrey Mankoff|title=United by Barbed Wire: Russian POWs in Germany, National Stereotypes, and International Relations|journal=Explorations in Russian and Eurasian History|year=2009|volume=10|issue=3|pages=475\u2013498|url=http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/kritika/v010/10.3.nagornaja.html|accessdate=February 14, 2014|doi=10.1353/kri.0.0111|last2=Jeffrey Mankoff}}</ref>\n\nAn element of the Russian propaganda was the Investigate Commission formed in April 1915. It was led by Aleksei Krivtsov and the study was tasked with the job of studying the legal violations committed by of the [[Central Powers]] and then getting this information to the Russian public. This commission published photographs of letters that were allegedly found on fallen German soldiers.

Approximately a month later, on July 28, 1914, Austria-Hungary declared war on Serbia. This act led to a series of events that would quickly expand into the First World War; thus, the Habsburg government in Vienna initiated the pivotal decision that would begin the conflict.<ref name=\"Williamson 1991 1\" />\n\nThe causes of the Great War have generally been defined in diplomatic terms, but certain deep-seated issues in Austria-Hungary undoubtedly contributed to the beginnings of the First World War.<ref>{{cite book|last=Mason|first=John W.|title=The Dissolution of the Austro-Hungarian Empire 1867\u20131918|year=1985|publisher=Longman Group Limited|location=London|page=61}}</ref> The Austro-Hungarian situation in the Balkans pre-1914 is a primary factor in its involvement in the war. The [[Pan-Slavism|movement towards South Slav unity]] was a major problem for the Habsburg Empire, which was facing increasing nationalist pressure from its multinational populace. As Europe's third largest state, the Austro-Hungarian monarchy was hardly homogeneous; comprising over fifty million people and eleven nationalities, the Empire was a conglomeration of a number of diverse cultures, languages, and peoples.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Mamatey|first=Albert|title=The Situation in Austria-Hungary|journal=The Journal of Race Development|year=1915|volume=6|issue=2|page=204}}</ref>\n\nSpecifically, the South Slavic people of Austria-Hungary desired to amalgamate with Serbia in an effort to officially solidify their shared cultural heritage. Over seven million South Slavs lived inside the Empire, while three million lived outside it.<ref>{{cite book|last=Mason|first=John W.|title=The Dissolution of the Austro-Hungarian Empire 1867\u20131918|year=1985|publisher=Longman Group Limited|location=London|page=67}}</ref> With the growing emergence of nationalism in the twentieth century, unity of all South Slavs looked promising. This tension is exemplified by [[Conrad von H\u00f6tzendorf]]'s letter to Franz Ferdinand:\n\n<blockquote>The unification of the South Slav race is one of the powerful national movements which can neither be ignored nor kept down. The question can only be, whether unification will take place within the boundaries of the Monarchy \u2013 that is at the expense of Serbia's independence \u2013 or under Serbia's leadership at the expense of the Monarchy. The cost to the Monarchy would be the loss of its South Slav provinces and thus of almost its entire coastline. The loss of territory and prestige would relegate the Monarchy to the status of a small power.<ref>{{cite book|last=Mason, John W.|title=The Dissolution of the Austro-Hungarian Empire 1867\u20131918|year=1985|publisher=Longman Group Limited|location=London|page=67}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe [[Bosnian crisis|annexation of Bosnia-Herzegovina]] in 1908 by Austrian foreign minister Baron von Aehrenthal in an effort to assert domination over the Balkans inflamed Slavic nationalism and angered Serbia. Bosnia-Herzegovina became a \"rallying cry\" for South Slavs, with hostilities between Austria-Hungary and Serbia steadily increasing.<ref>{{cite book|last=Williamson|first=Samuel R.|title=Austria-Hungary and the Origins of the First World War|year=1991|publisher=St. Martin's Press|location=New York|page=72}}</ref> The situation was ripe for conflict, and when the Serbian nationalist Gavrilo Princip assassinated Austrian imperial heir, Franz Ferdinand, these longstanding hostilities culminated into an all-out war.\n\nThe Allied Powers wholeheartedly supported the Slavs' nationalistic fight. George Macaulay Trevelyan, a British historian, saw Serbia's war against Austria-Hungary as a \"war of liberation\" that would \"free South Slavs from tyranny.\"<ref>{{cite journal|last=Trevelyan|first=George Macaulay|title=Austria-Hungary and Serbia|journal=The North American Review|date=June 1915|volume=201|issue=715|page=860}}</ref> In his own words: \"If ever there was a battle for freedom, there is such a battle now going on in Southeastern Europe against Austrian and Magyar.

The triumphs of Britain and Germany in the martial, diplomatic and economic spheres put these countries in the front rank of the world's leading nations.{{Sfn|Lieven|1983|p=35}} This was a source of national pride, self-confidence and unity. It helped reconcile the worker to the state and the Bavarian or Scotsman to rule from Berlin or London.\nIn the years prior to 1914, Austro-Russian co-operation was both crucial for European peace and difficult to maintain. Old suspicions exacerbated by the [[Bosnian crisis]] stood in the way of agreement between the two empires, as did ethnic sensitivities. Russia's historical role as liberator of the Balkans was difficult to square with Austria's determination to control adjacent territories. {{Sfn|Lieven|1983|p=39}} In 1913\u20131914 Saint Petersburg was too concerned with its own weakness and what it saw as threats to vital Russian interests, to spare much thought for Vienna's feelings. The Russians were, with some justice, indignant that the concessions they had made after the First [[Balkan War]] in the interest of European peace had not been reciprocated by the Central Powers.{{Sfn|Lieven|1983|p=42}}\n\nThis was doubly dangerous given the growing evidence flowing into Petersburg about Germany's aggressive intentions. Both Bazarov and the agents of the Russian secret political police in Germany reported the concern aroused in public opinion by the press war against Russia, which raged in the spring of 1914.{{Sfn|Lieven|1983|p=49}}\n\nThe Russian military was the largest in the world consisting of 1.4 million men prior to the war. They could also mobilize up to 5 million men, but only had 4.6 million rifles to give them.

At the end of 1914, the main focus of the fighting shifted to central part of [[Congress Poland|Russian Poland]], west of the river [[Vistula]].{{sfn|Dupuy|Onacewicz|1967|p=31}} The October [[Battle of the Vistula River]] and the November [[Battle of \u0141\u00f3d\u017a (1914)|Battle of \u0141\u00f3d\u017a]] brought little advancement for the Germans, but at least kept the Russians at a safe distance.{{sfn|Dupuy|Onacewicz|1967|p=3}}\n\nThe Russian and Austro-Hungarian armies continued to clash in and near the [[Carpathian Mountains]] throughout the winter of 1914\u20131915.

They made some progress, crossing the [[Carpathian Mountains|Carpathians]] in February and March 1915, but then the German relief helped the Austrians stop further Russian advances.

To eliminate the Russian threat the [[Central Powers]] began the campaign season of 1915 with the successful [[Gorlice\u2013Tarn\u00f3w Offensive]] in Galicia in May 1915.\n\nAfter the [[Second Battle of the Masurian Lakes]], the German and Austro-Hungarian troops in the Eastern Front functioned under a unified command. The offensive soon turned into a general advance and a [[Great Retreat (Russian)|corresponding strategic retreat]] by the Russian Army. The cause of the reverses suffered by the Russian Army was not so much errors in the tactical sphere, as the deficiency in technical equipment, particularly in artillery and ammunition as well as the corruption and incompetence of the Russian officers. Only by 1916 did the buildup of Russian war industries increase production of war material and improve the supply situation.\n\nBy mid-1915, the Russians had been expelled from [[Congress Poland|Russian Poland]] and hence pushed hundreds of kilometers away from the borders of the Central Powers, removing the threat of Russian invasion of Germany or Austria-Hungary.

However, the appointment of [[Grand Duke Nicholas Nikolaevich of Russia (1856\u20131929)|Grand Duke Nicholas Nikolaevich]] as Viceroy and Commander in the Caucasus in September 1915 revived the situation of the Russo-Turkish front.\n\nWhen the Allies withdrew from Gallipoli in December, the Caucasus Army's Chief of Staff General [[Nikolai Yudenich]] believed Turkish forces would take action against his army. This concern was legitimate: Bulgaria's entry into the war as Germany's ally in October caused serious alarm, as a land route from Germany to Turkey was now open and would allow for an unrestricted flow of German weapons to the Turks.<ref name=\"Jukes, Geoffrey 2002 38\" /> A \"window of opportunity\" appeared that would allow the Russians to destroy the Turkish Third Army, as the British required assistance in Mesopotamia (now modern day Iraq). Britain's efforts to besiege Baghdad had been halted at Ctesiphon, and they were forced to retreat. This led to an increasing number of attacks by Turkish forces. The British requested the Russians to attack in an attempt to distract the Turks, and Yudenich agreed.

The Turkish situation was exacerbated by the Third Army's commander Kamil Pasha and Chief of Staff Major Guse absence. Coupled with an imbalance of forces \u2013 the Russians had 325 000 troops, while the Turks only 78 000 \u2013 the situation appeared grim for the Central Powers.<ref name=\"Jukes, Geoffrey 2002 39\" /> After three months of fighting, the Russians captured the city of [[Trabzon]] on April 18, 1916.\n\n== 1916 ==\nAllied operations in 1916 were dictated by an urgent need to force Germany to transfer forces from its Western to Eastern fronts, to relieve the pressure on the French at the [[Battle of Verdun]]. This was to be accomplished by a series of Russian offensives which would force the Germans to deploy additional forces to counter them. The first such operation was the [[Lake Naroch Offensive]] in March\u2013April 1916, which ended in failure.\n\n=== Brusilov Offensive ===\n{{See also|Brusilov Offensive}}\n[[File:Eastern Front 1916-8.jpg|thumb|Brusilov Offensive]]\nThe Italian operations during 1916 had one extraordinarily positive result: Austrian divisions were pulled away from the Russian southern front. This allowed the Russian forces to organize a counter-offensive. The Brusilov Offensive was a large tactical assault carried out by Russian forces against Austro-Hungarian forces in Galicia. General [[Aleksei Brusilov]] believed victory against the Central Powers was possible if close attention was paid to preparation. Brusilov suggested that the Russians should attack on a wide front, and to position their trenches a mere seventy-five yard away from Austrian trenches.<ref>{{cite book|last=Keegan, John|title=The First World War|year=1998|publisher=Random House Inc.|location=New York|pages=303\u20134}}</ref>\n\nBrusilov's plan worked impeccably. The Russians outnumbered the Austrians 200,000 to 150,000, and held a considerable advantage in guns, with 904 large guns to 600. Most importantly innovative new tactics similar to those independently invented by [[Erwin Rommel]] were used to perform quick and effective close-range surprise attacks that allowed a steady advance.<ref name=\"Keegan, John 1998 304\">{{cite book|last=Keegan |first=John|title=The First World War|year=1998|publisher=Random House Inc.|location=New York|page=304}}</ref> The Russian Eighth Army overwhelmed the Austrian Fourth and pushed on to Lutsk, advancing forty miles beyond the starting position.

French and Russian diplomats had begun courting the Romanians early on, but persuasion tactics gradually intensified. For King Ferdinand to commit his force of half a million men, he expected the Allies to offer a substantial incentive.<ref>{{cite book|last=Mosier, John|title=The Myth of the Great War|year=2002|publisher=Perennial|location=New York|page=254}}</ref> Playing on Romanian anti-Hungarian sentiment the Allies promised the Austria-Hungarian territory of Ardeal (Transylvania) to Romania.

Additionally, the German Chief of the General Staff, General [[Erich Von Falkenhayn]] was forced to resign from office though his successor appointed him to command the combined Central Powers forces against Romania, along with General [[August von Mackensen]]. [[Kaiser Wilhelm II]] immediately replaced Falkenhayn with [[Paul von Hindenburg]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Gilbert, Martin|title=The First World War: A Complete History|year=1994|publisher=Henry Holt and Company|location=New York|page=282}}</ref> Von Hindenburg's deputy, the more adept [[Erich Ludendorff]], was given effective control of the army and ordered to advance on Romania.

Never before had two Great Powers like Germany and Austria found themselves so much at the mercy of the military resources of a country which had scarcely one twentieth of the population of the two great states. Judging by the military situation, it was to be expected that Rumania had only to advance where she wished to decide the world war in favor of those Powers which had been hurling themselves at us in vain for years. Thus everything seemed to depend on whether Rumania was ready to make any sort of use of her momentary advantage.|author=Paul von Hindenburg|source=''Out of My Life''<ref>Paul von Hindenburg, Out of My Life, Vol. I, trans.

Although numbering half a million men, the Romanian Army suffered from poor training and a lack of appropriate equipment.\n\nThe initial success of the Romanian Army in Austria-Hungarian territory was quickly undermined by the Central Powers. German and Austro-Hungarian troops advanced from the north, while Bulgarian-Turkish-German forces marched into Romania from the south. Although thought to be a tactical blunder by contemporaries, the Romanians opted to mount operations in both directions.<ref>{{cite book|last=Mosier, John|title=The Myth of the Great War|year=2002|publisher=Perennial|location=New York|page=259}}</ref> By the middle of November the German force passed through the Carpathians, suffering significant casualties due to determined Romanian resistance. By December 5, Bulgarian troops had crossed the Danube and were approaching the capital, [[Bucharest]].

Roughly 150,000 Romanian soldiers had been taken prisoner, 200,000 men were dead or wounded, and lost two thirds of their country, including the capital.<ref>{{cite book|last=Mosier, John|title=The Myth of the Great War|year=2002|publisher=Perennial|location=New York|page=260}}</ref> Importantly, the [[Ploie\u0219ti]] oilfields, the only significant source of oil in Europe west of the Black Sea, had been destroyed before they were abandoned to the Central Powers.\n\n== 1917 ==\n[[File:Eastern Front As of 1917.jpg|thumb|Eastern Front as of 1917]]\n\n=== Russia \u2013 the February Revolution ===\nThe Russian [[February Revolution]] aimed to topple the Russian monarchy and resulted in the creation of the Provisional Government. The revolution was a turning point in Russian history, and its significance and influence can still be felt in many countries today.{{Sfn|McCauley|1975|p=79}} Although many Russians wanted a revolution, no one had expected it to happen when it did \u2013 let alone how it did.\n\nOn International Women's Day, Thursday, February 23, 1917/March 8, 1917, as many as 90,000 female workers in the city of Petrograd left their factory jobs and marched through the streets, shouting \"Bread\", \"Down with the autocracy!\" and \"Stop the War!\" These women were tired, hungry, and angry,{{Sfn|McCauley|1975|p=84}} after working long hours in miserable conditions to feed their families because their menfolk were fighting at the front. They were not alone in demanding change; more than 150,000 men and women took to the streets to protest the next day.\n\nBy Saturday, February 25, the city of Petrograd was essentially shut down. No one was allowed to work or wanted to work.{{Sfn|McCauley|1975|p=87}} Even though there were a few incidents of police and soldiers firing into the crowds, those groups soon mutinied and joined the protesters.{{Sfn|McCauley|1975|p=86}} Tsar Nicholas II, who was not in Petrograd during the revolution, heard reports of the protests but chose not to take them seriously. By March 1, it was obvious to everyone except the czar himself, that his rule was over. On March 2 it was made official.{{Sfn|McCauley|1975|p=88}}\n\n=== Romania \u2013 the Summer Campaign and aftermath ===\nIn early July 1917, on the [[Romania during World War I#1917 campaign and armistice|Romanian front]], a relatively small area, there was one of the largest concentrations of combat forces and means known during the conflagration: nine armies, 80 infantry divisions with 974 battalions, 19 cavalry divisions with 550 squadrons and 923 artillery batteries, whose effectives numbered some 800,000 men, with about one million in their immediate [[Military reserve|reserve]]. The three great battles, decisive for the Romanian nation's destiny, delivered at [[R\u0103coasa|M\u0103r\u0103\u0219ti]], [[M\u0103r\u0103\u0219e\u0219ti]] and [[Oituz]] represented a turning point in the [[World War I|world war]] on the Eastern front. These battles, named by the localities and zones where they took place, were fought approximately on the front alignment stabilized in early 1917, which the conflicting sides had thoroughly consolidated for half a year.<ref name=\"Romania834\">Rom\u00e2nia \u00een anii primului r\u0103zboi mondial, vol. 2, p. 834</ref>\n\nBetween late July and early September, the Romanian Army fought the battles of [[Battle of M\u0103r\u0103\u0219ti|M\u0103r\u0103\u0219ti]], [[Battle of M\u0103r\u0103\u0219e\u0219ti|M\u0103r\u0103\u0219e\u0219ti]] and [[Second Battle of Oituz|Oituz]], managing to stop the German-Austro-Hungarian advance, inflicting heavy losses in the process and winning the most important Allied victories on the Eastern Front in 1917.\n\nAs a result of these operations, the remaining Romanian territories remained unoccupied, tying down nearly 1,000,000 Central Powers troops and prompting ''[[The Times]]'' to describe the Romanian front as \"The only point of light in the East\".\n\nOn May 7, 1918, in light of the existing politico-military situation, Romania was forced to conclude the [[Treaty of Bucharest, 1918|Treaty of Bucharest]] with the Central Powers, imposing harsh conditions on the country but recognizing its [[Union of Bessarabia with Romania|union with Bessarabia]]. [[Alexandru Marghiloman]] became the new German-sponsored Prime Minister. King Ferdinand, however, refused to sign the treaty.\n\nThe Germans were able to repair the oil fields around [[Ploie\u0219ti]] and by the end of the war had pumped a million tons of oil. They also requisitioned two million tons of grain from Romanian farmers. These materials were vital in keeping Germany in the war to the end of 1918.<ref>John Keegan, ''World War I'', pg. 308</ref>\n\n=== Russia \u2013 the October Revolution ===\n{{Main|October Revolution}}\n\nBy September 1917, just months after the February Revolution, Lenin believed the Russian people were ready for another revolution, this time on Marxist principles.{{Sfn|McCauley|1975|p=89}} On October 10, at a secret meeting of the Bolshevik party leaders, Lenin used all his power to convince the others that it was time for armed insurrection. Troops who were loyal to the Bolsheviks took control of the telegraph stations, power stations, strategic bridges, post offices, train stations, and state banks.{{Sfn|McCauley|1975|p=92}}\n\nPetrograd was officially in the hands of the Bolsheviks, who greatly increased their organization in factory groups and in many barracks throughout Petrograd. They concentrated on devising a plan for overturning the Provisional Government, with a coup d'\u00e9tat.{{Sfn|McCauley|1975|p=94}} On October 24, Lenin emerged from hiding in a suburb, entered the city, set up his headquarters at the Smolny Institute and worked to complete his three-phase plan. With the main bridges and the main railways secured, only the Winter Palace, and with it the Provisional Government, remained to be taken. On the evening of November 7, the troops that were loyal to the Bolsheviks infiltrated the Winter Palace. After an almost bloodless coup, the Bolsheviks were the new leaders of Russia.{{Sfn|McCauley|1975|p=94}} Lenin announced that the new regime would end the war, abolish all private land ownership, and create a system for workers' control over the factories.\n\n{{Use dmy dates|date=January 2020}}\n== 1918 ==\n[[File:Map Treaty of Brest-Litovsk-en.jpg|thumb|Territory lost by Russia under the 1918 [[Treaty of Brest-Litovsk]] ]]\n\n{{Main|Operation Faustschlag}}\n{{See also|Russian Civil War|Ukrainian\u2013Soviet War}}\n\nOn 7 November 1917, the Communist [[Bolsheviks]] took power under their leader [[Vladimir Lenin]]. Lenin's new Bolshevik government tried to end the war, with a [[Armistice between Russia and the Central Powers|ceasefire being declared on 15 December 1917]] along lines agreed in November. At the same time Bolsheviks launched a full-scale military offensive against its opponents: [[Ukrainian People's Republic|Ukraine]] and separatist governments in the Don region. During the peace negotiations between Soviets and Central Powers, the Germans demanded enormous concessions, eventually resulting in the failure of the long-drawn-out peace negotiations on 17 February 1918. At the same time the Central Powers concluded a military treaty with Ukraine which was losing ground in the fight with invading Bolshevik forces. {{Sfn|Kowalski|1997|p=115}} The Russian Civil War, which started just after November 1917, would tear apart Russia for three years. As a result of the events during 1917, many groups opposed to Lenin's Bolsheviks had formed. With the fall of Nicholas II, many parts of the Russian Empire took the opportunity to declare their independence, one of which was Finland, which did so in December 1917; however, Finland too collapsed into a [[Finnish Civil War|civil war]]. Finland declared itself independent 6 December 1917, and this was accepted by Lenin a month later.\nThe Finnish Parliament elected a German prince as King of Finland. However, the Socialists (The Reds) and the Whites in Finland fell into war with each other in January 1918. The Reds wanted Finland to be a Soviet republic, and was aided by Russian forces still in Finland.\nThe Whites of Finland were led by General Carl Gustaf Mannerheim, a Finnish baron who had been in the Tsars service since he was 15 years old.\nThe Whites were also offered help by a German Expeditionary Corps led by the German General Goltz. Though Mannerheim never accepted the offer, the German corps landed in Finland in April 1918.\n\n=== Formation of the Red Army ===\nAfter the disintegration of the Russian imperial army and navy in 1917, the Council of People's Commissars headed by Leon Trotsky set about creating a new army. By a decree on 28 January 1918 the council created the Workers' and Peoples' Red Army; it began recruitment on a voluntary basis, but on 22 April, the Soviet government made serving in the army compulsory for anyone who did not employ hired labor. While the majority of the army was made up of workers and peasants, many of the Red Army's officers had served a similar function in the imperial army before its collapse.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/Red-Army|title=Red Army - Soviet history|website=britannica.com|access-date=22 October 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160629212429/https://www.britannica.com/topic/Red-Army|archive-date=29 June 2016|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n=== Treaty of Brest-Litovsk (March 1918) ===\nWith the German Army just {{convert|85|mi}} from the Russian capital [[Petrograd]] (St. Petersburg) on 3 March 1918, the [[Treaty of Brest-Litovsk]] was signed and the Eastern Front ceased to be a war zone. While the treaty was practically obsolete before the end of the year, it did provide some relief to the Bolsheviks, who were embroiled in a civil war, and affirmed the independence of [[Ukraine]]. However, [[Estonia]] and [[Latvia]] were intended to become a [[United Baltic Duchy]] to be ruled by German princes and German nobility as fiefdoms under the German Kaiser. [[Finland]]'s sovereignty had already been declared in December 1917, and accepted by most nations, including France and the Soviet Union, but not by the United Kingdom and the United States.\n\n== Armistice  ==\n\nWith the end of the Eastern Front, the Germans were able to transfer substantial forces to the west in order to mount an [[Spring Offensive|offensive in France]] in the spring of 1918.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}\n\nThis offensive on the Western Front failed to achieve a decisive breakthrough, and the arrival of more and more [[American Expeditionary Force|American units]] in Europe was sufficient to offset the German advantage. Even after the Russian collapse, about a million German soldiers remained tied up in the east until the end of the war, attempting to run a short-lived addition to the German Empire in Europe. In the end, Germany and Austria lost all their captured lands, and more, under various treaties (such as the [[Treaty of Versailles]]) signed after the armistice in 1918.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}\n\n== Role of women on the Eastern Front ==\n[[File:EcaterinaTeodoroiu.jpg|thumb|2nd Lt.

It is estimated that 20 percent of the Russian industrial working class was conscripted into the army; therefore, women's share of industrial jobs increased dramatically. There were percentage increases in every industry, but the most noticeable increase happened in industrial labour, which increased from 31.4 percent in 1913 to 45 percent in 1918.<ref>{{cite book|last=Goldman |first=W.

In the later stages of Russia's participation in the war, Russia began forming all-woman combat units, the [[Women's Battalion]]s, in part to fight plummeting morale among male soldiers by demonstrating Russian women's willingness to fight. In Romania, [[Ecaterina Teodoroiu]] actively fought in the Romanian Army and is remembered today as a national hero.\n\nBritish nursing efforts were not limited to the Western Front. Nicknamed the \"Gray partridges\" in reference to their dark gray overcoats, Scottish volunteer nurses arrived in Romania in 1916 under the leadership of [[Elsie Inglis]].

During the 1914 Russian campaign the Russians began taking thousands of Austrian prisoners. As a result, the Russian authorities made emergency facilities in Kiev, Penza, Kazan, and later Turkestan to hold the Austrian prisoners of war. As the war continued Russia began to detain soldiers from Germany as well as a growing number from the Austro-Hungarian army. The Tsarist state saw the large population of POWs as a workforce that could benefit the war economy in Russia. Many [[POWs]] were employed as farm laborers and miners in Donbas and Krivoi Rog. However, the majority of POWs were employed as laborers constructing canals and building railroads. The living and working environments for these POWs was bleak. There was a shortage of food, clean drinking water and proper medical care. During the summer months malaria was a major problem, and the malnutrition among the POWs led to many cases of scurvy. While working on the Murmansk rail building project over 25,000 POWs died. Information about the bleak conditions of the labor camps reached the German and Austro-Hungarian governments. They began to complain about the treatment of POWs. The Tsarist authorities initially refused to acknowledge the German and Habsburg governments. They rejected their claims because Russian POWs were working on railway construction in Serbia. However, they slowly agreed to stop using prison labor.<ref name=\"Project Muse\">{{cite journal|last=Gatrell|first=Peter|title=Prisoners of War on the Eastern Front during World War I|journal=Kritika|year=2005|volume=6|issue=3|pages=557\u2013566|url=http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/kritika/v006/6.3gatrell.html|accessdate=March 18, 2014|doi=10.1353/kri.2005.0036}}</ref> Life in the camps was extremely rough for the men who resided in them. The Tsarist government could not provide adequate supplies for the men living in their POW camps. The Russian government's inability to supply the POWs in their camps with supplies was due to inadequate resources and bureaucratic rivalries. However, the conditions in the POW camps varied; some were more bearable than others.<ref name=\"Project Muse\" />\n\n== Disease on the Eastern Front ==\nDisease played a critical role in the loss of life on the Eastern Front. In the East, disease accounted for approximately four times the number of deaths caused by direct combat, in contrast to the three to one ratio in the West.{{Sfn|Liulevicius|2000|p=22}} Malaria, cholera, and dysentery contributed to the epidemiological crisis on the Eastern Front; however, typhus fever, transmitted by pathogenic lice and previously unknown to German medical officers before the outbreak of the war, was the most deadly. There was a direct correlation between the environmental conditions of the East and the prevalence of disease. With cities excessively crowded by refugees fleeing their native countries, unsanitary medical conditions created a suitable environment for diseases to spread. Primitive hygienic conditions, along with general lack of knowledge about proper medical care was evident in the German occupied [[Ober Ost]].{{Sfn|Liulevicius|2000|p=81}}\n\nUltimately, a large scale sanitation program was put into effect. This program, named ''Sanitit\u00e4tswesen'' (Medical Affairs), was responsible for ensuring proper hygienic procedures were being carried out in Latvia, Lithuania, and Poland. Quarantine centers were built, and diseased neighbourhoods were isolated from the rest of the population. Delousing stations were prevalent in the countryside and in cities to prevent the spread of typhus fever, with mass numbers of natives being forced to take part in this process at military bathhouses. A \"sanitary police\" was also introduced to confirm the cleanliness of homes, and any home deemed unfit would be boarded up with a warning sign.{{Sfn|Liulevicius|2000|p=81}} Dogs and cats were also killed for fear of possible infection.\n\nTo avoid the spread of disease, prostitution became regulated. Prostitutes were required to register for a permit, and authorities demanded mandatory medical examinations for all prostitutes, estimating that seventy percent of prostitutes carried a venereal disease.{{Sfn|Liulevicius|2000|p=81}} Military brothels were introduced to combat disease; the city of [[Kowno]] emphasized proper educational use of contraceptives such as condoms, encouraged proper cleansing of the genital area after intercourse, and gave instructions on treatment in the case of infection.{{Sfn|Liulevicius|2000|p=81}}\n\n== Casualties ==\n{{Details|topic=Russian losses|World War I casualties#endnote Russia}}\nThe Russian casualties in the First World War are difficult to estimate, due to the poor quality of available statistics.\n\nCornish gives a total of 2,006,000 military dead (700,000 killed in action, 970,000 died of wounds, 155,000 died of disease and 181,000 died while POWs). This measure of Russian losses is similar to that of the British Empire, 5% of the male population in the 15 to 49 age group. He says civilian casualties were five to six hundred thousand in the first two years, and were then not kept, so a total of ''over 1,500,000'' is not unlikely.

The population consisted of Czechs (51%), Slovaks (16%), Germans (22%), Hungarians (5%) and [[Rusyns]] (4%), with other ethnic groups making up 2%.<ref>\"The War of the World\", Niall Ferguson Allen Lane 2006.</ref> Many of the Germans, Hungarians, Ruthenians and Poles<ref name=\"pp\">{{cite web |url=http://www.praguepost.com/articles/2005/07/06/playing-the-blame-game.php |title=Playing the blame game |accessdate=2008-06-30 |url-status=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080630084718/http://www.praguepost.com/articles/2005/07/06/playing-the-blame-game.php |archivedate=June 30, 2008 }}, ''[[Prague Post]]'', 6 July 2005</ref> and some Slovaks, felt oppressed because the political elite did not generally allow political autonomy for minority ethnic groups.\nThe state proclaimed the official ideology that there are no Czechs and Slovaks, but only one nation of Czechoslovaks (see [[Czechoslovakism]]), to the disagreement of Slovaks and other ethnic groups. Once a unified Czechoslovakia was restored after World War II the conflict between the [[Czechs]] and the [[Slovaks]] surfaced again.\n\n=== Hungary ===\nAfter the war Hungary was severely disrupted by the loss of 72% of its territory, 64% of its population and most of its natural resources. The loss of territory was similar to that of Austria after the breaking up the Austria-Hungary territory. They lost the territories of Transylvania, Slovakia, Croatia, Slavonia, [[Syrmia]], and [[Banat]].<ref name=\"Tucker 1998 220\u2013223\" />\n\n=== Italy ===\nItaly incorporated the regions of Trieste and South Tyrol from Austria.\n\n=== Poland ===\nThe creation of a free and Independent Poland was one of [[Fourteen Points|Wilson's fourteen points]]. At the end of the 18th century the state of Poland was broken apart by Prussia, Russia, and Austria. During the [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919]], the [[Commission on Polish Affairs]] was created which recommended there be a passageway across West Prussia and Posen, in order to give Poland access to the Baltic through the port of Danzig at the mouth of the Vistula River. The creation of the state of Poland would cut off 1.5 million Germans in East Prussia from the rest of Germany. Poland also received Upper Silesia. British [[Foreign Office|Foreign Secretary]] [[George Curzon, 1st Marquess Curzon of Kedleston|Lord Curzon]] proposed [[Curzon Line|Poland's eastern border with Russia]]. Neither the Soviet Russians nor the Polish were happy with the demarcation of the border.<ref name=\"Tucker 1998 220\u2013223\">{{cite book|last=Tucker|first=Spencer .C|title=The Great War 1914\u201318|url=https://archive.org/details/greatwar19141800tuck|url-access=registration|year=1998|publisher=Indiana University Press|location=Bloomington|pages=[https://archive.org/details/greatwar19141800tuck/page/220 220\u2013223]}}</ref>\n\n=== Romania ===\nThe state of Romania was enlarged greatly after the war. As a result of the Paris peace conference Romania kept the [[Dobrudja]] and Transylvania. Between the states of Yugoslavia, Czechoslovakia, and Romania an alliance named the [[Little Entente]] was formed. They worked together on matters of foreign policy in order to prevent a Habsburg restoration.<ref name=\"Tucker 1998 220\u2013223\" />\n\n=== Yugoslavia ===\nInitially [[Yugoslavia]] began as the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes. The name was changed to Yugoslavia in 1929. The State secured its territory at the Paris peace talks after the end of the war. The state suffered from many internal problems because of the many diverse cultures and languages within the state. Yugoslavia was divided on national, linguistic, economic, and religious lines.<ref name=\"Tucker 1998 220\u2013223\" />\n\n== See also ==\n{{portal|World War I}}\n*[[Belgian Expeditionary Corps in Russia]], a Belgian armoured car unit that fought within the Russian military.\n* [[Diplomatic history of World War I]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{reflist}}\n{{reflist|group=nb}}\n\n== References ==\n* Trevelyan, George Macaulay (June 1915). \"Austria-Hungary and Serbia\".

This plan was criticised as Austria-Hungary could be a greater threat than the German Empire. So instead of four armies invading East Prussia, the Russians planned to send two armies to East Prussia, and two armies to defend against Austro-Hungarian forces invading from [[Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria|Galicia]]. In the opening months of the war, the [[Imperial Russian Army]] attempted an [[Russian invasion of East Prussia (1914)|invasion]] of eastern Prussia in the [[Northwestern Front (Russian Empire)|northwestern theater]], only to be [[Battle of Tannenberg|beaten back]] by the Germans after some [[Battle of Gumbinnen|initial success]].

The Entente promised the region of [[Transylvania]] (which was part of Austria-Hungary) in return for Romanian support. The Romanian Army [[Battle of Transylvania|invaded Transylvania]] and had initial successes, but was forced to stop and was pushed back by the Germans and Austro-Hungarians when Bulgaria attacked them in the south. Meanwhile, a [[February Revolution|revolution]] occurred in Russia in February 1917 (one of the several causes being the hardships of the war). Tsar Nicholas II was forced to abdicate and a [[Russian Provisional Government]] was founded, with [[Georgy Lvov]] as its first leader, who was eventually replaced by [[Alexander Kerensky]].\n\nThe newly formed [[Russian Republic]] continued to fight the war alongside Romania and the rest of the Entente until it was [[October Revolution|overthrown]] by the [[Bolsheviks]] in October 1917. Kerensky oversaw the [[Kerensky Offensive|July Offensive]], which was largely a failure and caused a collapse in the Russian Army. The [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|new government]] established by the Bolsheviks signed the [[Treaty of Brest-Litovsk]] with the Central Powers, taking it out of the war and making large territorial concessions. Romania was also forced to surrender and signed a [[Treaty of Bucharest (1918)|similar treaty]], though both of the treaties were nullified with the surrender of the Central Powers in November 1918.\n\n\n== Geography ==\nThe front in the east was much longer than that in the west. The theater of war was roughly delimited by the [[Baltic Sea]] in the west and [[Minsk]] in the east, and [[Saint Petersburg]] in the north and the [[Black Sea]] in the south, a distance of more than {{convert|1600|km|mi}}. This had a drastic effect on the nature of the warfare.\n[[File:Timeline of WWI Eastern Front.jpg|thumb|580px|A timeline of events on the [[Eastern Front (World War I)|Eastern]] and [[Middle-Eastern theatre of World War I|Middle-Eastern]] theatres of World War I]]\n\nWhile the war on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]] developed into [[trench warfare]], the battle lines on the Eastern Front were much more fluid and trenches never truly developed. This was because the greater length of the front ensured that the density of soldiers in the line was lower so the line was easier to break. Once broken, the sparse communication networks made it difficult for the defender to rush reinforcements to the rupture in the line, mounting rapid counteroffensives to seal off any breakthrough.\n\n== Propaganda ==\nPropaganda was a key component of the culture of World War I. It was most commonly deployed through the state-controlled media to glorify the homeland and demonize the enemy. Propaganda often took the form of images which portrayed stereotypes from folklore about the enemy or from glorified moments from the nation's history. On the Eastern Front, propaganda took many forms such as opera, film, spy fiction, theater, spectacle, war novels and graphic art. Across the Eastern Front the amount of propaganda used in each country varied from state to state. Propaganda took many forms within each country and was distributed by many different groups. Most commonly the state produced propaganda, but other groups, such as anti-war organizations, also generated propaganda.<ref>{{cite book|editor1-last=Roshwald|editor1-first=Aviel|editor2-last=Stites|editor2-first=Richard|title=European Culture in the Great War:The Arts, Entertainment and Propaganda 1914\u20131918|url=https://books.google.com/?id=uteV3ytfmqQC&pg=PA176&lpg=PA176&dq=European+Culture+in+the+Great+War#v=onepage&q=European%20Culture%20in%20the%20Great%20War&f=false|year=1999|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|location=Cambridge|pages=6,349\u2013358|isbn=978-0-521-01324-6}}</ref>\n\n== Initial situation in belligerent countries ==\n=== Germany ===\n{{Main|German entry into World War I}}\nPrior to the outbreak of war, German strategy was based almost entirely on the so-called [[Schlieffen Plan]]. With the [[Franco-Russian Alliance|Franco-Russian Agreement]] in place, Germany knew that war with either of these combatants would result in war with the other, which meant that there would be war in both the west and the east. Therefore, the German General Staff, under Alfred von Schlieffen and then [[Helmuth von Moltke the Younger]], planned a quick, all-out ground war on the Western Front to take France and, upon victory, Germany would turn its attention to Russia in the east.\n\nSchlieffen believed Russia would not be ready or willing to move against and attack Germany due to the huge losses of military equipment that Russia had suffered in the [[Russo-Japanese war]] of 1904\u20131905, its low population density and lack of railroads.\n\nConversely, the German Navy believed it could be victorious over Britain with Russian neutrality, something which Moltke knew would not be possible.\n\n=== Romania ===\n[[File:Greater Rumania, New York Times, 1919.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|Border changes in favor of Romania as stipulated in the [[Treaty of Bucharest (1916)|Treaty of Bucharest]]]]\nIn the immediate years preceding the [[First World War]], the Kingdom of Romania was involved in the [[Second Balkan War]] on the side of Serbia, Montenegro, Greece and the Ottoman Empire against Bulgaria. The [[Treaty of Bucharest (1913)|Treaty of Bucharest]], signed on August 10, 1913, ended the Balkan conflict and added 6,960 square kilometers to Romania's territory.<ref>{{cite book|last=Miller, William|title=The Balkans: Roumania, Bulgaria, Serbia and Montenegro|year=1922|publisher=T. Fisher Unwin Ltd|location=London|page=474}}</ref> Although militarized, Romania decided upon a policy of neutrality at the start of the First World War, mainly due to having territorial interests in both Austria-Hungary ([[Transylvania]] and [[Bukovina]]) and in Russia ([[Bessarabia]]). Strong cultural influences also affected Romanian leanings, however. King [[Carol I]], as a [[Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen]], favoured his Germanic roots, while the Romanian people, influenced by their Orthodox church and Latin-based language, were inclined to join France. Perhaps King Carol's attempts at joining the war on the side of the Central powers would have been fruitful had he not died in 1914, but Romanian disenchantment with Austria-Hungary had already influenced public and political opinion. French endorsement of Romanian action against Bulgaria, and support of the terms of the Treaty of Bucharest was particularly effective at inclining Romania towards the Entente. Furthermore, Russian courting of Romanian sympathies, exemplified by the visit of the Tsar to [[Constan\u021ba]] on June 14, 1914, signaled in a new era of positive relations between the two countries.<ref>{{cite book|last=Hitchins, Keith|title=Rumania:1866\u20131947|year=1994|publisher=Clarendon Press|location=Oxford|pages=153\u20134}}</ref> Nevertheless, King [[Ferdinand I of Romania|Ferdinand I]] of Romania maintained a policy of neutrality, intending to gain the most for Romania by negotiating between competing powers. The result of the negotiations with the Entente was the [[Treaty of Bucharest (1916)]], which stipulated the conditions under which Romania agreed to join the war on the side of the Entente, particularly territorial promises in [[Austria-Hungary]]: Transylvania, [[Cri\u0219ana]] and [[Maramure\u0219 (historical region)|Maramure\u0219]], the whole [[Banat]] and most of Bukovina. According to historian John Keegan, these enticements offered by the Allies were never concrete, for in secret, Russia and France agreed not to honor any conventions when the end of the war came.<ref>{{cite book|last=Keegan, John|title=the First World War|year=1998|publisher=Random House Inc.|location=New York|pages=306}}</ref>\n\n=== Russia ===\n{{Main|Russian entry into World War I}}\nThe immediate reason for Russia's involvement in the First World War was a direct result of the decisions made by the statesmen and generals during July 1914. The [[July crisis]] was the culmination of a series of diplomatic conflicts that took place in the decades prior to 1914, and this is fundamental to an understanding of Russia's position immediately prior to the War. According to [[Dominic Lieven|D. C. Lieven]], Russia was formidable and was able to back up her diplomatic policies with force. One of the most significant factors in bringing Russia to the brink of war was the downfall of her economy.{{Sfn|Lieven|1983|p=5}} The 20 percent jump in defense expenditure during 1866\u201377 and in 1871-5 forced them to change their position within Europe and shift the balance of power out of her favour.{{Sfn|Lieven|1983|p=8}} At the time, Russian infrastructure was backward and the Russian government had to invest far more than its European rivals in structural changes. In addition there were overwhelming burdens of defense, which would ultimately result in an economic downfall for the Russians. This was a major strain on the Russian population, but also served as a direct threat to military expenditure.{{Sfn|Lieven|1983|p=27}} Thus the only way the Russians could sustain the strains of European war would be to place more emphasis on foreign investment from the French who essentially came to Russia's aid for industrial change.{{Sfn|Lieven|1983|p=28}} The [[Franco-Russian Alliance]] allowed for the Russian defense to grow and aid the European balance of power during the growth of the German Empire's might. Nevertheless, one of the key factors was that of the Russian foreign policy between 1890 and 1914.\n\n==== Russian propaganda ====\n[[File:\u0412\u043e\u0435\u043d\u043d\u044b\u044f \u043a\u0430\u0440\u0438\u043a\u0430\u0442\u0443\u0440\u044b.jpg|thumb|upright|World War I caricature from Russia depicting [[Wilhelm II, German Emperor|Wilhelm II]], [[Franz Joseph I of Austria|Franz Joseph I]] and [[Mehmed V]].

Their main aim was to help overcome the legend of the \"invincible\" German war machine, in order to boost the morale of civilians and soldiers. Russian propaganda often took the form of showing the Germans as a civilized nation, with barbaric \"inhuman\" traits. Russian propaganda also exploited the image of the Russian [[POW]]s who were in the German camps, again in order to boost the morale of their troops, serving as encouragement to defeat the enemy and to get their fellow soldiers out of the \"inhuman\" German POW camps.<ref name=\"oxana475\">{{cite journal|last=Oxana Nagornaja|first=Jeffrey Mankoff|title=United by Barbed Wire: Russian POWs in Germany, National Stereotypes, and International Relations|journal=Explorations in Russian and Eurasian History|year=2009|volume=10|issue=3|pages=475\u2013498|url=http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/kritika/v010/10.3.nagornaja.html|accessdate=February 14, 2014|doi=10.1353/kri.0.0111|last2=Jeffrey Mankoff}}</ref>\n\nAn element of the Russian propaganda was the Investigate Commission formed in April 1915. It was led by Aleksei Krivtsov and the study was tasked with the job of studying the legal violations committed by of the [[Central Powers]] and then getting this information to the Russian public. This commission published photographs of letters that were allegedly found on fallen German soldiers. These letters document the German correspondents saying to \"take no prisoners.\" A museum was also set up in Petrograd, which displayed pictures that showed how \"inhumanly\" the Germans were treating prisoners of war.<ref name=\"oxana475\" />\n\n=== Austria-Hungary ===\n{{Main|Austro-Hungarian entry into World War I}}\n[[File:Bosnian Crisis 1908.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Illustration from the French magazine Le Petit Journal on the Bosnian Crisis.

Approximately a month later, on July 28, 1914, Austria-Hungary declared war on Serbia. This act led to a series of events that would quickly expand into the First World War; thus, the Habsburg government in Vienna initiated the pivotal decision that would begin the conflict.<ref name=\"Williamson 1991 1\" />\n\nThe causes of the Great War have generally been defined in diplomatic terms, but certain deep-seated issues in Austria-Hungary undoubtedly contributed to the beginnings of the First World War.<ref>{{cite book|last=Mason|first=John W.|title=The Dissolution of the Austro-Hungarian Empire 1867\u20131918|year=1985|publisher=Longman Group Limited|location=London|page=61}}</ref> The Austro-Hungarian situation in the Balkans pre-1914 is a primary factor in its involvement in the war. The [[Pan-Slavism|movement towards South Slav unity]] was a major problem for the Habsburg Empire, which was facing increasing nationalist pressure from its multinational populace. As Europe's third largest state, the Austro-Hungarian monarchy was hardly homogeneous; comprising over fifty million people and eleven nationalities, the Empire was a conglomeration of a number of diverse cultures, languages, and peoples.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Mamatey|first=Albert|title=The Situation in Austria-Hungary|journal=The Journal of Race Development|year=1915|volume=6|issue=2|page=204}}</ref>\n\nSpecifically, the South Slavic people of Austria-Hungary desired to amalgamate with Serbia in an effort to officially solidify their shared cultural heritage. Over seven million South Slavs lived inside the Empire, while three million lived outside it.<ref>{{cite book|last=Mason|first=John W.|title=The Dissolution of the Austro-Hungarian Empire 1867\u20131918|year=1985|publisher=Longman Group Limited|location=London|page=67}}</ref> With the growing emergence of nationalism in the twentieth century, unity of all South Slavs looked promising. This tension is exemplified by [[Conrad von H\u00f6tzendorf]]'s letter to Franz Ferdinand:\n\n<blockquote>The unification of the South Slav race is one of the powerful national movements which can neither be ignored nor kept down. The question can only be, whether unification will take place within the boundaries of the Monarchy \u2013 that is at the expense of Serbia's independence \u2013 or under Serbia's leadership at the expense of the Monarchy. The cost to the Monarchy would be the loss of its South Slav provinces and thus of almost its entire coastline. The loss of territory and prestige would relegate the Monarchy to the status of a small power.<ref>{{cite book|last=Mason, John W.|title=The Dissolution of the Austro-Hungarian Empire 1867\u20131918|year=1985|publisher=Longman Group Limited|location=London|page=67}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe [[Bosnian crisis|annexation of Bosnia-Herzegovina]] in 1908 by Austrian foreign minister Baron von Aehrenthal in an effort to assert domination over the Balkans inflamed Slavic nationalism and angered Serbia. Bosnia-Herzegovina became a \"rallying cry\" for South Slavs, with hostilities between Austria-Hungary and Serbia steadily increasing.<ref>{{cite book|last=Williamson|first=Samuel R.|title=Austria-Hungary and the Origins of the First World War|year=1991|publisher=St. Martin's Press|location=New York|page=72}}</ref> The situation was ripe for conflict, and when the Serbian nationalist Gavrilo Princip assassinated Austrian imperial heir, Franz Ferdinand, these longstanding hostilities culminated into an all-out war.\n\nThe Allied Powers wholeheartedly supported the Slavs' nationalistic fight. George Macaulay Trevelyan, a British historian, saw Serbia's war against Austria-Hungary as a \"war of liberation\" that would \"free South Slavs from tyranny.\"<ref>{{cite journal|last=Trevelyan|first=George Macaulay|title=Austria-Hungary and Serbia|journal=The North American Review|date=June 1915|volume=201|issue=715|page=860}}</ref> In his own words: \"If ever there was a battle for freedom, there is such a battle now going on in Southeastern Europe against Austrian and Magyar. If this war ends in the overthrow of the Magyar tyranny, an immense step forward will have been taken toward racial liberty and European peace.\"<ref>{{cite journal|last=Trevelyan|first=George Macaulay|title=Austria-Hungary and Serbia|journal=The North American Review|date=June 1915|volume=201|issue=715|page=868}}</ref>\n\n== Russia prior to 1914 ==\nPrior to 1914, the Russian's lack of success in war and diplomacy in the six decades before 1914 sapped the country's moral strength. The triumphs of Britain and Germany in the martial, diplomatic and economic spheres put these countries in the front rank of the world's leading nations.{{Sfn|Lieven|1983|p=35}} This was a source of national pride, self-confidence and unity. It helped reconcile the worker to the state and the Bavarian or Scotsman to rule from Berlin or London.\nIn the years prior to 1914, Austro-Russian co-operation was both crucial for European peace and difficult to maintain. Old suspicions exacerbated by the [[Bosnian crisis]] stood in the way of agreement between the two empires, as did ethnic sensitivities. Russia's historical role as liberator of the Balkans was difficult to square with Austria's determination to control adjacent territories. {{Sfn|Lieven|1983|p=39}} In 1913\u20131914 Saint Petersburg was too concerned with its own weakness and what it saw as threats to vital Russian interests, to spare much thought for Vienna's feelings. The Russians were, with some justice, indignant that the concessions they had made after the First [[Balkan War]] in the interest of European peace had not been reciprocated by the Central Powers.{{Sfn|Lieven|1983|p=42}}\n\nThis was doubly dangerous given the growing evidence flowing into Petersburg about Germany's aggressive intentions. Both Bazarov and the agents of the Russian secret political police in Germany reported the concern aroused in public opinion by the press war against Russia, which raged in the spring of 1914.{{Sfn|Lieven|1983|p=49}}\n\nThe Russian military was the largest in the world consisting of 1.4 million men prior to the war. They could also mobilize up to 5 million men, but only had 4.6 million rifles to give them.

At the end of 1914, the main focus of the fighting shifted to central part of [[Congress Poland|Russian Poland]], west of the river [[Vistula]].{{sfn|Dupuy|Onacewicz|1967|p=31}} The October [[Battle of the Vistula River]] and the November [[Battle of \u0141\u00f3d\u017a (1914)|Battle of \u0141\u00f3d\u017a]] brought little advancement for the Germans, but at least kept the Russians at a safe distance.{{sfn|Dupuy|Onacewicz|1967|p=3}}\n\nThe Russian and Austro-Hungarian armies continued to clash in and near the [[Carpathian Mountains]] throughout the winter of 1914\u20131915.

To eliminate the Russian threat the [[Central Powers]] began the campaign season of 1915 with the successful [[Gorlice\u2013Tarn\u00f3w Offensive]] in Galicia in May 1915.\n\nAfter the [[Second Battle of the Masurian Lakes]], the German and Austro-Hungarian troops in the Eastern Front functioned under a unified command. The offensive soon turned into a general advance and a [[Great Retreat (Russian)|corresponding strategic retreat]] by the Russian Army. The cause of the reverses suffered by the Russian Army was not so much errors in the tactical sphere, as the deficiency in technical equipment, particularly in artillery and ammunition as well as the corruption and incompetence of the Russian officers. Only by 1916 did the buildup of Russian war industries increase production of war material and improve the supply situation.\n\nBy mid-1915, the Russians had been expelled from [[Congress Poland|Russian Poland]] and hence pushed hundreds of kilometers away from the borders of the Central Powers, removing the threat of Russian invasion of Germany or Austria-Hungary. At the end of 1915 German-Austrian advance was stopped on the line [[Riga]]\u2013[[J\u0113kabpils|Jakobstadt]]\u2013[[D\u00fcnaburg]]\u2013[[Baranovichi]]\u2013[[Pinsk]]\u2013[[Dubno]]\u2013[[Ternopil]].

The Turks were concerned with reorganizing their army and committing the [[Armenian Genocide]].<ref name=\"Jukes, Geoffrey 2002 38\">{{cite book|last=Jukes, Geoffrey|title=Essential Histories: The First World War, The Eastern Front 1914\u20131918|year=2002|publisher=Osprey Publishing|location=Oxford|page=38}}</ref> Meanwhile, Russia was preoccupied with other armies on the Eastern Front. However, the appointment of [[Grand Duke Nicholas Nikolaevich of Russia (1856\u20131929)|Grand Duke Nicholas Nikolaevich]] as Viceroy and Commander in the Caucasus in September 1915 revived the situation of the Russo-Turkish front.\n\nWhen the Allies withdrew from Gallipoli in December, the Caucasus Army's Chief of Staff General [[Nikolai Yudenich]] believed Turkish forces would take action against his army. This concern was legitimate: Bulgaria's entry into the war as Germany's ally in October caused serious alarm, as a land route from Germany to Turkey was now open and would allow for an unrestricted flow of German weapons to the Turks.<ref name=\"Jukes, Geoffrey 2002 38\" /> A \"window of opportunity\" appeared that would allow the Russians to destroy the Turkish Third Army, as the British required assistance in Mesopotamia (now modern day Iraq). Britain's efforts to besiege Baghdad had been halted at Ctesiphon, and they were forced to retreat. This led to an increasing number of attacks by Turkish forces. The British requested the Russians to attack in an attempt to distract the Turks, and Yudenich agreed. [[Erzurum Offensive|The resulting offensive]] began on January 10, 1916.<ref name=\"Jukes, Geoffrey 2002 39\">{{cite book|last=Jukes, Geoffrey|title=Essential Histories: The First World War, The Eastern Front 1914\u20131918|year=2002|publisher=Osprey Publishing|location=Oxford|page=39}}</ref>\n\nThis offensive was unanticipated by the Turks, as it was in the middle of winter. The Turkish situation was exacerbated by the Third Army's commander Kamil Pasha and Chief of Staff Major Guse absence. Coupled with an imbalance of forces \u2013 the Russians had 325 000 troops, while the Turks only 78 000 \u2013 the situation appeared grim for the Central Powers.<ref name=\"Jukes, Geoffrey 2002 39\" /> After three months of fighting, the Russians captured the city of [[Trabzon]] on April 18, 1916.\n\n== 1916 ==\nAllied operations in 1916 were dictated by an urgent need to force Germany to transfer forces from its Western to Eastern fronts, to relieve the pressure on the French at the [[Battle of Verdun]]. This was to be accomplished by a series of Russian offensives which would force the Germans to deploy additional forces to counter them. The first such operation was the [[Lake Naroch Offensive]] in March\u2013April 1916, which ended in failure.\n\n=== Brusilov Offensive ===\n{{See also|Brusilov Offensive}}\n[[File:Eastern Front 1916-8.jpg|thumb|Brusilov Offensive]]\nThe Italian operations during 1916 had one extraordinarily positive result: Austrian divisions were pulled away from the Russian southern front. This allowed the Russian forces to organize a counter-offensive. The Brusilov Offensive was a large tactical assault carried out by Russian forces against Austro-Hungarian forces in Galicia. General [[Aleksei Brusilov]] believed victory against the Central Powers was possible if close attention was paid to preparation. Brusilov suggested that the Russians should attack on a wide front, and to position their trenches a mere seventy-five yard away from Austrian trenches.<ref>{{cite book|last=Keegan, John|title=The First World War|year=1998|publisher=Random House Inc.|location=New York|pages=303\u20134}}</ref>\n\nBrusilov's plan worked impeccably. The Russians outnumbered the Austrians 200,000 to 150,000, and held a considerable advantage in guns, with 904 large guns to 600. Most importantly innovative new tactics similar to those independently invented by [[Erwin Rommel]] were used to perform quick and effective close-range surprise attacks that allowed a steady advance.<ref name=\"Keegan, John 1998 304\">{{cite book|last=Keegan |first=John|title=The First World War|year=1998|publisher=Random House Inc.|location=New York|page=304}}</ref> The Russian Eighth Army overwhelmed the Austrian Fourth and pushed on to Lutsk, advancing forty miles beyond the starting position.

Judging by the military situation, it was to be expected that Rumania had only to advance where she wished to decide the world war in favor of those Powers which had been hurling themselves at us in vain for years.

Although numbering half a million men, the Romanian Army suffered from poor training and a lack of appropriate equipment.\n\nThe initial success of the Romanian Army in Austria-Hungarian territory was quickly undermined by the Central Powers. German and Austro-Hungarian troops advanced from the north, while Bulgarian-Turkish-German forces marched into Romania from the south. Although thought to be a tactical blunder by contemporaries, the Romanians opted to mount operations in both directions.<ref>{{cite book|last=Mosier, John|title=The Myth of the Great War|year=2002|publisher=Perennial|location=New York|page=259}}</ref> By the middle of November the German force passed through the Carpathians, suffering significant casualties due to determined Romanian resistance.

On March 2 it was made official.{{Sfn|McCauley|1975|p=88}}\n\n=== Romania \u2013 the Summer Campaign and aftermath ===\nIn early July 1917, on the [[Romania during World War I#1917 campaign and armistice|Romanian front]], a relatively small area, there was one of the largest concentrations of combat forces and means known during the conflagration: nine armies, 80 infantry divisions with 974 battalions, 19 cavalry divisions with 550 squadrons and 923 artillery batteries, whose effectives numbered some 800,000 men, with about one million in their immediate [[Military reserve|reserve]]. The three great battles, decisive for the Romanian nation's destiny, delivered at [[R\u0103coasa|M\u0103r\u0103\u0219ti]], [[M\u0103r\u0103\u0219e\u0219ti]] and [[Oituz]] represented a turning point in the [[World War I|world war]] on the Eastern front.

[[Alexandru Marghiloman]] became the new German-sponsored Prime Minister. King Ferdinand, however, refused to sign the treaty.\n\nThe Germans were able to repair the oil fields around [[Ploie\u0219ti]] and by the end of the war had pumped a million tons of oil. They also requisitioned two million tons of grain from Romanian farmers. These materials were vital in keeping Germany in the war to the end of 1918.<ref>John Keegan, ''World War I'', pg. 308</ref>\n\n=== Russia \u2013 the October Revolution ===\n{{Main|October Revolution}}\n\nBy September 1917, just months after the February Revolution, Lenin believed the Russian people were ready for another revolution, this time on Marxist principles.{{Sfn|McCauley|1975|p=89}} On October 10, at a secret meeting of the Bolshevik party leaders, Lenin used all his power to convince the others that it was time for armed insurrection. Troops who were loyal to the Bolsheviks took control of the telegraph stations, power stations, strategic bridges, post offices, train stations, and state banks.{{Sfn|McCauley|1975|p=92}}\n\nPetrograd was officially in the hands of the Bolsheviks, who greatly increased their organization in factory groups and in many barracks throughout Petrograd. They concentrated on devising a plan for overturning the Provisional Government, with a coup d'\u00e9tat.{{Sfn|McCauley|1975|p=94}} On October 24, Lenin emerged from hiding in a suburb, entered the city, set up his headquarters at the Smolny Institute and worked to complete his three-phase plan. With the main bridges and the main railways secured, only the Winter Palace, and with it the Provisional Government, remained to be taken. On the evening of November 7, the troops that were loyal to the Bolsheviks infiltrated the Winter Palace. After an almost bloodless coup, the Bolsheviks were the new leaders of Russia.{{Sfn|McCauley|1975|p=94}} Lenin announced that the new regime would end the war, abolish all private land ownership, and create a system for workers' control over the factories.\n\n{{Use dmy dates|date=January 2020}}\n== 1918 ==\n[[File:Map Treaty of Brest-Litovsk-en.jpg|thumb|Territory lost by Russia under the 1918 [[Treaty of Brest-Litovsk]] ]]\n\n{{Main|Operation Faustschlag}}\n{{See also|Russian Civil War|Ukrainian\u2013Soviet War}}\n\nOn 7 November 1917, the Communist [[Bolsheviks]] took power under their leader [[Vladimir Lenin]]. Lenin's new Bolshevik government tried to end the war, with a [[Armistice between Russia and the Central Powers|ceasefire being declared on 15 December 1917]] along lines agreed in November. At the same time Bolsheviks launched a full-scale military offensive against its opponents: [[Ukrainian People's Republic|Ukraine]] and separatist governments in the Don region. During the peace negotiations between Soviets and Central Powers, the Germans demanded enormous concessions, eventually resulting in the failure of the long-drawn-out peace negotiations on 17 February 1918. At the same time the Central Powers concluded a military treaty with Ukraine which was losing ground in the fight with invading Bolshevik forces. {{Sfn|Kowalski|1997|p=115}} The Russian Civil War, which started just after November 1917, would tear apart Russia for three years. As a result of the events during 1917, many groups opposed to Lenin's Bolsheviks had formed. With the fall of Nicholas II, many parts of the Russian Empire took the opportunity to declare their independence, one of which was Finland, which did so in December 1917; however, Finland too collapsed into a [[Finnish Civil War|civil war]]. Finland declared itself independent 6 December 1917, and this was accepted by Lenin a month later.\nThe Finnish Parliament elected a German prince as King of Finland. However, the Socialists (The Reds) and the Whites in Finland fell into war with each other in January 1918. The Reds wanted Finland to be a Soviet republic, and was aided by Russian forces still in Finland.\nThe Whites of Finland were led by General Carl Gustaf Mannerheim, a Finnish baron who had been in the Tsars service since he was 15 years old.\nThe Whites were also offered help by a German Expeditionary Corps led by the German General Goltz. Though Mannerheim never accepted the offer, the German corps landed in Finland in April 1918.\n\n=== Formation of the Red Army ===\nAfter the disintegration of the Russian imperial army and navy in 1917, the Council of People's Commissars headed by Leon Trotsky set about creating a new army. By a decree on 28 January 1918 the council created the Workers' and Peoples' Red Army; it began recruitment on a voluntary basis, but on 22 April, the Soviet government made serving in the army compulsory for anyone who did not employ hired labor. While the majority of the army was made up of workers and peasants, many of the Red Army's officers had served a similar function in the imperial army before its collapse.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/Red-Army|title=Red Army - Soviet history|website=britannica.com|access-date=22 October 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160629212429/https://www.britannica.com/topic/Red-Army|archive-date=29 June 2016|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n=== Treaty of Brest-Litovsk (March 1918) ===\nWith the German Army just {{convert|85|mi}} from the Russian capital [[Petrograd]] (St. Petersburg) on 3 March 1918, the [[Treaty of Brest-Litovsk]] was signed and the Eastern Front ceased to be a war zone.

However, [[Estonia]] and [[Latvia]] were intended to become a [[United Baltic Duchy]] to be ruled by German princes and German nobility as fiefdoms under the German Kaiser.

It is estimated that 20 percent of the Russian industrial working class was conscripted into the army; therefore, women's share of industrial jobs increased dramatically. There were percentage increases in every industry, but the most noticeable increase happened in industrial labour, which increased from 31.4 percent in 1913 to 45 percent in 1918.<ref>{{cite book|last=Goldman |first=W. Z.|title=Women at the Gates: Gender and Industry in Stalin's Russia|year=2002|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|location=Cambridge|pages=10\u201311}}</ref>\n\nWomen also fought on the Eastern Front. In the later stages of Russia's participation in the war, Russia began forming all-woman combat units, the [[Women's Battalion]]s, in part to fight plummeting morale among male soldiers by demonstrating Russian women's willingness to fight. In Romania, [[Ecaterina Teodoroiu]] actively fought in the Romanian Army and is remembered today as a national hero.\n\nBritish nursing efforts were not limited to the Western Front. Nicknamed the \"Gray partridges\" in reference to their dark gray overcoats, Scottish volunteer nurses arrived in Romania in 1916 under the leadership of [[Elsie Inglis]]. In addition to nursing injured personnel, Scottish nurses manned transport vehicles and acted as regimental cooks.<ref>{{cite book|last=Coroban |first=Costel|title=Potarnichile gri.

During the 1914 Russian campaign the Russians began taking thousands of Austrian prisoners. As a result, the Russian authorities made emergency facilities in Kiev, Penza, Kazan, and later Turkestan to hold the Austrian prisoners of war. As the war continued Russia began to detain soldiers from Germany as well as a growing number from the Austro-Hungarian army. The Tsarist state saw the large population of POWs as a workforce that could benefit the war economy in Russia. Many [[POWs]] were employed as farm laborers and miners in Donbas and Krivoi Rog. However, the majority of POWs were employed as laborers constructing canals and building railroads. The living and working environments for these POWs was bleak. There was a shortage of food, clean drinking water and proper medical care. During the summer months malaria was a major problem, and the malnutrition among the POWs led to many cases of scurvy. While working on the Murmansk rail building project over 25,000 POWs died. Information about the bleak conditions of the labor camps reached the German and Austro-Hungarian governments. They began to complain about the treatment of POWs. The Tsarist authorities initially refused to acknowledge the German and Habsburg governments. They rejected their claims because Russian POWs were working on railway construction in Serbia. However, they slowly agreed to stop using prison labor.<ref name=\"Project Muse\">{{cite journal|last=Gatrell|first=Peter|title=Prisoners of War on the Eastern Front during World War I|journal=Kritika|year=2005|volume=6|issue=3|pages=557\u2013566|url=http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/kritika/v006/6.3gatrell.html|accessdate=March 18, 2014|doi=10.1353/kri.2005.0036}}</ref> Life in the camps was extremely rough for the men who resided in them. The Tsarist government could not provide adequate supplies for the men living in their POW camps. The Russian government's inability to supply the POWs in their camps with supplies was due to inadequate resources and bureaucratic rivalries. However, the conditions in the POW camps varied; some were more bearable than others.<ref name=\"Project Muse\" />\n\n== Disease on the Eastern Front ==\nDisease played a critical role in the loss of life on the Eastern Front. In the East, disease accounted for approximately four times the number of deaths caused by direct combat, in contrast to the three to one ratio in the West.{{Sfn|Liulevicius|2000|p=22}} Malaria, cholera, and dysentery contributed to the epidemiological crisis on the Eastern Front; however, typhus fever, transmitted by pathogenic lice and previously unknown to German medical officers before the outbreak of the war, was the most deadly. There was a direct correlation between the environmental conditions of the East and the prevalence of disease. With cities excessively crowded by refugees fleeing their native countries, unsanitary medical conditions created a suitable environment for diseases to spread. Primitive hygienic conditions, along with general lack of knowledge about proper medical care was evident in the German occupied [[Ober Ost]].{{Sfn|Liulevicius|2000|p=81}}\n\nUltimately, a large scale sanitation program was put into effect. This program, named ''Sanitit\u00e4tswesen'' (Medical Affairs), was responsible for ensuring proper hygienic procedures were being carried out in Latvia, Lithuania, and Poland. Quarantine centers were built, and diseased neighbourhoods were isolated from the rest of the population. Delousing stations were prevalent in the countryside and in cities to prevent the spread of typhus fever, with mass numbers of natives being forced to take part in this process at military bathhouses. A \"sanitary police\" was also introduced to confirm the cleanliness of homes, and any home deemed unfit would be boarded up with a warning sign.{{Sfn|Liulevicius|2000|p=81}} Dogs and cats were also killed for fear of possible infection.\n\nTo avoid the spread of disease, prostitution became regulated. Prostitutes were required to register for a permit, and authorities demanded mandatory medical examinations for all prostitutes, estimating that seventy percent of prostitutes carried a venereal disease.{{Sfn|Liulevicius|2000|p=81}} Military brothels were introduced to combat disease; the city of [[Kowno]] emphasized proper educational use of contraceptives such as condoms, encouraged proper cleansing of the genital area after intercourse, and gave instructions on treatment in the case of infection.{{Sfn|Liulevicius|2000|p=81}}\n\n== Casualties ==\n{{Details|topic=Russian losses|World War I casualties#endnote Russia}}\nThe Russian casualties in the First World War are difficult to estimate, due to the poor quality of available statistics.\n\nCornish gives a total of 2,006,000 military dead (700,000 killed in action, 970,000 died of wounds, 155,000 died of disease and 181,000 died while POWs). This measure of Russian losses is similar to that of the British Empire, 5% of the male population in the 15 to 49 age group. He says civilian casualties were five to six hundred thousand in the first two years, and were then not kept, so a total of ''over 1,500,000'' is not unlikely. He has over five million men ''passing into captivity'', the majority during 1915.<ref>{{cite book | last = Cornish | first = Nik | title = The Russian Army and the First World War | publisher = Tempus | location = Stroud | year = 2006 | isbn = 1-86227-288-3|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Russian_Army_and_the_First_World_War.html?id=BeVmAAAAMAAJ}}</ref>\n\nWhen Russia withdrew from the war, 2,500,000 Russian POWs were in German and Austrian hands. This by far exceeded the total number of prisoners of war (1,880,000) lost by the armies of [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Britain]], France and Germany combined. Only the [[Austro-Hungarian Army]], with 2,200,000 POWs, came even close.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.pbs.org/greatwar/resources/casdeath_pop.html |title=WWI Casualties and Deaths |publisher=[[PBS]] |accessdate=2014-03-07 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161003230916/https://www.pbs.org/greatwar/resources/casdeath_pop.html |archive-date=2016-10-03 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n== Territorial changes ==\n{{See also|Austria-Hungary#Territorial legacy}}\n\n=== Austria ===\nThe empire of Austria lost approximately 60% of its territory as a result of the war, and evolved into a smaller state with a small homogeneous population of 6.5 million people. With the loss Vienna was now an imperial capital without an empire to support it. The states that were formed around Austria feared the return of the Austro-Hungarian Empire and put measures into place to prevent it from re-forming.<ref name=\"Tucker 1998 220\u2013223\" />\n\n=== Czechoslovakia ===\n[[Czechoslovakia]] was created through the merging of the Czech provinces of Bohemia and Moravia, previously under Austrian rule, united with Slovakia and Ruthenia, which were part of Hungary. Although these groups had many differences between them, they believed that together they would create a stronger state.\nThe new country was a multi-ethnic state. The population consisted of Czechs (51%), Slovaks (16%), Germans (22%), Hungarians (5%) and [[Rusyns]] (4%), with other ethnic groups making up 2%.<ref>\"The War of the World\", Niall Ferguson Allen Lane 2006.</ref> Many of the Germans, Hungarians, Ruthenians and Poles<ref name=\"pp\">{{cite web |url=http://www.praguepost.com/articles/2005/07/06/playing-the-blame-game.php |title=Playing the blame game |accessdate=2008-06-30 |url-status=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080630084718/http://www.praguepost.com/articles/2005/07/06/playing-the-blame-game.php |archivedate=June 30, 2008 }}, ''[[Prague Post]]'', 6 July 2005</ref> and some Slovaks, felt oppressed because the political elite did not generally allow political autonomy for minority ethnic groups.\nThe state proclaimed the official ideology that there are no Czechs and Slovaks, but only one nation of Czechoslovaks (see [[Czechoslovakism]]), to the disagreement of Slovaks and other ethnic groups. Once a unified Czechoslovakia was restored after World War II the conflict between the [[Czechs]] and the [[Slovaks]] surfaced again.\n\n=== Hungary ===\nAfter the war Hungary was severely disrupted by the loss of 72% of its territory, 64% of its population and most of its natural resources. The loss of territory was similar to that of Austria after the breaking up the Austria-Hungary territory. They lost the territories of Transylvania, Slovakia, Croatia, Slavonia, [[Syrmia]], and [[Banat]].<ref name=\"Tucker 1998 220\u2013223\" />\n\n=== Italy ===\nItaly incorporated the regions of Trieste and South Tyrol from Austria.\n\n=== Poland ===\nThe creation of a free and Independent Poland was one of [[Fourteen Points|Wilson's fourteen points]]. At the end of the 18th century the state of Poland was broken apart by Prussia, Russia, and Austria. During the [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919]], the [[Commission on Polish Affairs]] was created which recommended there be a passageway across West Prussia and Posen, in order to give Poland access to the Baltic through the port of Danzig at the mouth of the Vistula River. The creation of the state of Poland would cut off 1.5 million Germans in East Prussia from the rest of Germany. Poland also received Upper Silesia. British [[Foreign Office|Foreign Secretary]] [[George Curzon, 1st Marquess Curzon of Kedleston|Lord Curzon]] proposed [[Curzon Line|Poland's eastern border with Russia]].

As a result of the Paris peace conference Romania kept the [[Dobrudja]] and Transylvania. Between the states of Yugoslavia, Czechoslovakia, and Romania an alliance named the [[Little Entente]] was formed. They worked together on matters of foreign policy in order to prevent a Habsburg restoration.<ref name=\"Tucker 1998 220\u2013223\" />\n\n=== Yugoslavia ===\nInitially [[Yugoslavia]] began as the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes. The name was changed to Yugoslavia in 1929. The State secured its territory at the Paris peace talks after the end of the war.
