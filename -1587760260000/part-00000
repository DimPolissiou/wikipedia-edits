With the Boston Braves in 1944, he pitched two no-hitters, although one of them was five innings, which was considered a no-hitter until 1991 when the MLB officially defined a no-hitter as having to be nine innings or longer.\n\n==Professional baseball career==\nTobin was born in Oakland, California, where the hometown [[Oakland Oaks (PCL)|Oakland Oaks]] of the [[Pacific Coast League]] picked him up. They sent him to their Bisbee-Douglas farm team in the [[Arizona\u2013Texas League]]. The [[New York Yankees]] signed him shortly thereafter. He played for them in Binghamton and Wheeling in 1933 and 1934. The Yankees sent him back to Oakland in 1935, where he compiled an 11\u20138 record before tearing the cartilage in his left knee. Appendicitis kept him off the Yankee roster the following year, and he went 16\u20138 for the Oaks.\n\nRather than return to the Oaks in 1937, he arranged a deal with the [[Pittsburgh Pirates]], with whom he made his major league debut on April 30, 1937.\n\nIn 1940, Tobin joined the [[Boston Braves (baseball)|Boston Braves]]. On May 13, 1942, he became the only pitcher in modern major-league history to hit three home runs in one game ([[Guy Hecker]] hit three homers in a game in the 19th century). He finished the 1942 season with a 12 wins and league leading 21 loses record and pitched a league leading 20 homeruns to opposing batters.  He also hit 6 homeruns that year as a pitcher and pinch-hitter.\n\nStill with the Braves in 1944, Tobin began throwing a [[knuckleball]], and that season he threw his two no-hitters. The first was April 27, 1944 when he beat the [[Brooklyn Dodgers]] 2\u20130. The second was a five inning game on June 22, 1944, in which the [[Philadelphia Phillies]] fell 7\u20130 (officially, this game is no longer considered a true no-hitter, as it lasted fewer than nine innings).<ref name=hoffman>{{cite news |first=Benjamin |last=Hoffman |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/20/sports/baseball/knuckleballers-have-a-history-as-colorful-as-their-pitch.html |title=When Knucklers Danced With Greatness |accessdate=February 21, 2015 |date=June 20, 2012 |newspaper=The New York Times}}</ref>\n\nIn another interesting event in 1944, Tobin drew a walk against [[Cincinnati Reds]] pitcher [[Clyde Shoun]] in the third inning of what would otherwise have been a perfect game for Shoun (who settled instead for a no-hitter).<ref name=hoffman/>\n\nTobin was with the Tigers in 1945, when they won the American League pennant and the [[1945 World Series|World Series]]. He pitched in Game 1 of the series, on October 3, which was his final major league game.\n\nHe was back in the Pacific Coast League the following year, pitching for the [[Seattle Rainiers]] and the [[San Francisco Seals (baseball)|San Francisco Seals]]. He was released in 1947, but the Oaks re-signed him in August 1948. That year he pitched the last out against the [[Sacramento Solons]] in a game that clinched the pennant for the Oaks.\n\nTobin was the brother of [[Boston Red Sox]] third baseman [[Jackie Tobin]].\n\n==Career statistics==\nWhile Tobin played only one major league game at a position other than pitcher, he pinch-hit over 100 times in his major league career. The fine-hitting hurler batted .230/.303/.345 in the majors. He totaled 35 doubles, 17 homers and 102 RBI in 796 at-bats.\n\nTobin went 105\u2013112 in the majors with a 3.44 ERA.

It is the most important archaeological site in Schleswig-Holstein. Around 965, chronicler [[Ibrahim ibn Yaqub|Ibrahim ibn Ahmed At-Tart\u00fbschi]] visited Hedeby and described it as, \"a very large city at the very end of the world's ocean.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://haithabu.de/de/zur-geschichte|title=Zur Geschichte - Wikinger Museum Haithabu|website=haithabu.de|language=de|access-date=2020-04-08}}</ref> \n\nThe settlement developed as a trading centre at the head of a narrow, navigable inlet known as the [[Schlei]], which connects to the [[Baltic Sea]]. The location was favorable because there is a short portage of less than 15&nbsp;km to the [[Treene River]], which flows into the [[Eider River|Eider]] with its [[North Sea]] estuary, making it a convenient place where goods and ships could be pulled on a [[corduroy road]] overland for an almost uninterrupted seaway between the Baltic and the North Sea and avoid a dangerous and time-consuming circumnavigation of Jutland, providing Hedeby with a role similar to later [[L\u00fcbeck]].\nHedeby was the second largest Nordic town during the Viking Age, after [[Upp\u00e5kra]] in present-day southern Sweden,<ref>Sveriges riksdag, [http://www.riksdagen.se/sv/Dokument-Lagar/Forslag/Motioner/Fornlamningen-Uppakra_GX02Kr327/?text=true Motion 2009/10:Kr327 Fornl\u00e4mningen Upp\u00e5kra] 2009-10-05</ref>\nThe city of [[Schleswig, Schleswig-Holstein|Schleswig]] was later founded on the other side of the Schlei.

In 808 the Danish king [[Gudfred|Godfred]] (Lat. Godofredus) destroyed a competing [[Early Slavs|Slav]] trade centre named [[Reric]], and it is recorded in the Frankish chronicles that he moved the merchants from there to Hedeby. This may have provided the initial impetus for the town to develop. The same sources record that Godfred strengthened the [[Danevirke]], an earthen wall that stretched across the south of the Jutland peninsula. The [[Danevirke]] joined the defensive walls of Hedeby to form an east-west barrier across the peninsula, from the marshes in the west to the Schlei inlet leading into the Baltic in the east.\n\nThe town itself was surrounded on its three landward sides (north, west, and south) by earthworks. At the end of the 9th century the northern and southern parts of the town were abandoned for the central section. Later a 9-metre (29-ft) high semi-circular wall was erected to guard the western approaches to the town. On the eastern side, the town was bordered by the innermost part of the Schlei inlet and the bay of [[Haddebyer Noor]].\n\n===Timeline===\n{| class=\"toccolours\" align=\"centre\" cellpadding=\"2\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"margin:0 0 1em 1em; font-size: 95%;\"\n|colspan=1 style=\"padding:0.3em;border-collapse:collapse;background-color:#ccccff\" align=center|based on Elsner<ref>{{cite book | first = Hildegard | last = Elsner | year = 1989 | title = Wikinger Museum Haithabu: Schaufenster einer fr\u00fchen Stadt | chapter = | editor = | others = | pages = | location = Neum\u00fcnster | publisher = Wachholtz | id = | url = | authorlink = }}</ref>\n|-\n|valign=top|'''793'''\n|Viking raid on [[Lindisfarne]] - traditional date for the beginning of the [[Viking Age]].\n|-\n|valign=top|'''804'''\n|First mention of Hedeby\n|-\n|valign=top|'''808'''\n|Destruction of [[Reric]] and migration of tradespeople to Hedeby\n|-\n|'''c. 850'''\n|Construction of a church at Hedeby\n|-\n|'''886'''\n|The [[Danelaw]] is established in [[England]], following Viking invasion\n|-\n|'''911'''\n|The Vikings settle in [[Normandy]]\n|-\n|'''948'''\n|Hedeby becomes a bishopric\n|-\n|'''965'''\n|Visit of [[Ibrahim ibn Yaqub al-Tartushi|Al-Tartushi]] to Hedeby\n|-\n|'''974'''\n|Hedeby falls to the [[Holy Roman Empire]]\n|-\n|'''983'''\n|Hedeby returns to Danish control\n|-\n|'''c. 1000'''\n|The Viking [[Leif Erikson]] explores [[Vinland]], probably in Newfoundland\n|-\n|'''1016-1042'''\n|Danish kings rule in England\n|-\n|'''1050'''\n|The Norwegian King [[Harald Hardrada]] destroys Hedeby\n|-\n|'''1066'''\n|Final destruction of Hedeby by a Slavic army.\n|-\n|'''1066'''\n|Traditional end of the [[Viking Age]]\n|}\n\n===Rise===\nHedeby became a principal marketplace because of its geographical location on the major trade routes between the [[Frankish Empire]] and [[Scandinavia]] (north-south), and between the [[Baltic Sea|Baltic]] and the [[North Sea]] (east-west). Between 800 and 1000 the growing economic power of the [[Vikings]] led to its dramatic expansion as a major trading centre. Along with [[Birka]] and [[Schleswig]], Hedeby's prominence as a major international trading hub served as a foundation of the [[Hanseatic League]] that would emerge by the 12th century.<ref>{{cite thesis |last=Smith |first=Jillian R. |date=May 2010 |title=Hanseatic Cogs and Baltic Trade: Interrelations Between Trade, Technology and Ecology |type= |chapter=2 |publisher=University of Nebraska at Lincoln |docket= |oclc= |url=http://digitalcommons.unl.edu/anthrotheses/4 |access-date=1 July 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe following indicate the importance achieved by the town:\n* The town was described by visitors from England ([[Wulfstan of Hedeby|Wulfstan]] - 9th century) and the Mediterranean ([[Ibrahim ibn Yaqub al-Tartushi|Al-Tartushi]] - 10th century).\n* Hedeby became the seat of a bishop (948) and belonged to the Archbishopric of [[Hamburg]] and [[Archdiocese of Bremen|Bremen]].\n* The town minted its own coins (from 825).\n* [[Adam of Bremen]] (11th century) reports that ships were sent from this ''portus maritimus'' to Slavic lands, to [[Sweden]], [[Sambia Peninsula|Samland]] (''Semlant'') and even [[Greece]].\n\nA Swedish dynasty founded by [[Olof the Brash]] is said to have ruled Hedeby during the last decades of the 9th century and the first part of the 10th century. This was told to [[Adam of Bremen]] by the Danish king [[Sweyn Estridsson]], and it is supported by three [[runestone]]s found in Denmark. Two of them were raised by the mother of Olof's grandson [[Sigtrygg Gnupasson]]. The third runestone, discovered in 1796, is from Hedeby, the ''[[Stone of Eric]]'' ({{lang-sv|Erikstenen}}).  It is inscribed with [[Runic alphabet#Younger Fu\u00feark|Norwegian-Swedish runes]]. It is, however, possible that Danes also occasionally wrote with this version of the [[Runic alphabet#Younger Fu\u00feark|younger futhark]].\n\n===Lifestyle===\nLife was short and crowded in Hedeby. The small houses were clustered tightly together in a grid, with the east-west streets leading down to jetties in the harbour. People rarely lived beyond 30 or 40, and archaeological research shows that their later years were often painful due to crippling diseases such as tuberculosis.<ref>{{cite web|author=Consulate General of Denmark in New York |title=Factsheet |url=http://www.denmark.org/about_denmark/factsheets_articles/factsheets_vikings.html |accessdate=January 14, 2006 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060113013845/http://www.denmark.org/about_denmark/factsheets_articles/factsheets_vikings.html |archivedate=January 13, 2006 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Yet make-up for men and rights for women provide surprises to the modern understanding.\n\n[[Ibrahim ibn Yaqub al-Tartushi|Al-Tartushi]], a late  10th-century traveller from [[al-Andalus]], provides one of the most colourful and often quoted descriptions of life in Hedeby. Al-Tartushi was from [[C\u00f3rdoba, Spain|Cordoba]] in [[Spain]], which had a significantly more wealthy and comfortable lifestyle than Hedeby. While Hedeby may have been significant by Scandinavian standards, Al-Tartushi was unimpressed:\n:''\"Slesvig (Hedeby) is a very large town at the extreme end of the world ocean... The inhabitants worship [[Sirius]], except for a minority of Christians who have a church of their own there.... He who slaughters a sacrificial animal puts up poles at the door to his courtyard and impales the animal on them, be it a piece of cattle, a ram, billy goat or a pig so that his neighbours will be aware that he is making a sacrifice in honour of his god. The town is poor in goods and riches. People eat mainly fish which exist in abundance. Babies are thrown into the sea for reasons of economy. The right to divorce belongs to the women.... Artificial eye make-up is another peculiarity; when they wear it their beauty never disappears, indeed it is enhanced in both men and women.

He set the town on fire by sending several burning ships into the harbour, the charred remains of which were found at the bottom of the Schlei during recent excavations. A Norwegian ''[[skald]]'', quoted by [[Snorri Sturluson]], describes the sack as follows:\n:''Burnt in anger from end to end was Hedeby[..]''\n:''High rose the flames from the houses when, before dawn, I stood upon the stronghold's arm''<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://heimskringla.no/wiki/Sagan_af_Haraldi_har%C3%B0r%C3%A1%C3%B0a | title=Sagan af Haraldi har\u00f0r\u00e1\u00f0a \u2013 heimskringla.no}}</ref>\n\nIn 1066 the town was [[Looting|sacked]] and burned by [[West Slavs]].<ref>{{cite news|author1=Nancy Marie Brown|title=The Far Traveler: Voyages of a Viking Woman|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aUE9ZFNeCBsC&pg=PT110 |accessdate=6 March 2016|pages=95}}</ref> Following the destruction, Hedeby was slowly abandoned. People moved across the [[Schlei]] [[F\u00f6rde|inlet]], which separates the two peninsulas of [[Angeln]] and [[Schwansen]], and founded the town of [[Schleswig, Schleswig-Holstein|Schleswig]].\n\n==Archaeology==\n\n===20th-century excavations===\nAfter the settlement was abandoned, rising waters contributed to the complete disappearance of all visible structures on the site. It was even forgotten where the settlement had been. This proved to be fortunate for later archaeological work at the site.\n\n[[File:File Haithabu Wikinger Museum 3 28-03-2010.jpg|thumb|View of the Viking Museum]]\n\nArchaeological work began at the site in 1900 after the rediscovery of the settlement. Excavations were conducted for the next 15 years. Further excavations were carried out between 1930 and 1939. Archaeological work on the site was productive for two main reasons: that the site had never been built on since its destruction some 840 years earlier, and that the permanently waterlogged ground had preserved wood and other perishable materials. After the Second World War, in 1959, archaeological work was started again and has continued intermittently ever since.

It is the most important archaeological site in Schleswig-Holstein. Around 965, chronicler [[Ibrahim ibn Yaqub|Ibrahim ibn Ahmed At-Tart\u00fbschi]] visited Hedeby and described it as, \"a very large city at the very end of the world's ocean.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://haithabu.de/de/zur-geschichte|title=Zur Geschichte - Wikinger Museum Haithabu|website=haithabu.de|language=de|access-date=2020-04-08}}</ref> \n\nThe settlement developed as a trading centre at the head of a narrow, navigable inlet known as the [[Schlei]], which connects to the [[Baltic Sea]]. The location was favorable because there is a short portage of less than 15&nbsp;km to the [[Treene River]], which flows into the [[Eider River|Eider]] with its [[North Sea]] estuary, making it a convenient place where goods and ships could be pulled on a [[corduroy road]] overland for an almost uninterrupted seaway between the Baltic and the North Sea and avoid a dangerous and time-consuming circumnavigation of Jutland, providing Hedeby with a role similar to later [[L\u00fcbeck]].\nHedeby was the second largest Nordic town during the Viking Age, after [[Upp\u00e5kra]] in present-day southern Sweden,<ref>Sveriges riksdag, [http://www.riksdagen.se/sv/Dokument-Lagar/Forslag/Motioner/Fornlamningen-Uppakra_GX02Kr327/?text=true Motion 2009/10:Kr327 Fornl\u00e4mningen Upp\u00e5kra] 2009-10-05</ref>\nThe city of [[Schleswig, Schleswig-Holstein|Schleswig]] was later founded on the other side of the Schlei.

In 808 the Danish king [[Gudfred|Godfred]] (Lat. Godofredus) destroyed a competing [[Early Slavs|Slav]] trade centre named [[Reric]], and it is recorded in the Frankish chronicles that he moved the merchants from there to Hedeby. This may have provided the initial impetus for the town to develop. The same sources record that Godfred strengthened the [[Danevirke]], an earthen wall that stretched across the south of the Jutland peninsula. The [[Danevirke]] joined the defensive walls of Hedeby to form an east-west barrier across the peninsula, from the marshes in the west to the Schlei inlet leading into the Baltic in the east.\n\nThe town itself was surrounded on its three landward sides (north, west, and south) by earthworks. At the end of the 9th century the northern and southern parts of the town were abandoned for the central section. Later a 9-metre (29-ft) high semi-circular wall was erected to guard the western approaches to the town. On the eastern side, the town was bordered by the innermost part of the Schlei inlet and the bay of [[Haddebyer Noor]].\n\n===Timeline===\n{| class=\"toccolours\" align=\"centre\" cellpadding=\"2\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"margin:0 0 1em 1em; font-size: 95%;\"\n|colspan=1 style=\"padding:0.3em;border-collapse:collapse;background-color:#ccccff\" align=center|based on Elsner<ref>{{cite book | first = Hildegard | last = Elsner | year = 1989 | title = Wikinger Museum Haithabu: Schaufenster einer fr\u00fchen Stadt | chapter = | editor = | others = | pages = | location = Neum\u00fcnster | publisher = Wachholtz | id = | url = | authorlink = }}</ref>\n|-\n|valign=top|'''793'''\n|Viking raid on [[Lindisfarne]] - traditional date for the beginning of the [[Viking Age]].\n|-\n|valign=top|'''804'''\n|First mention of Hedeby\n|-\n|valign=top|'''808'''\n|Destruction of [[Reric]] and migration of tradespeople to Hedeby\n|-\n|'''c. 850'''\n|Construction of a church at Hedeby\n|-\n|'''886'''\n|The [[Danelaw]] is established in [[England]], following Viking invasion\n|-\n|'''911'''\n|The Vikings settle in [[Normandy]]\n|-\n|'''948'''\n|Hedeby becomes a bishopric\n|-\n|'''965'''\n|Visit of [[Ibrahim ibn Yaqub al-Tartushi|Al-Tartushi]] to Hedeby\n|-\n|'''974'''\n|Hedeby falls to the [[Holy Roman Empire]]\n|-\n|'''983'''\n|Hedeby returns to Danish control\n|-\n|'''c. 1000'''\n|The Viking [[Leif Erikson]] explores [[Vinland]], probably in Newfoundland\n|-\n|'''1016-1042'''\n|Danish kings rule in England\n|-\n|'''1050'''\n|The Norwegian King [[Harald Hardrada]] destroys Hedeby\n|-\n|'''1066'''\n|Final destruction of Hedeby by a Slavic army.\n|-\n|'''1066'''\n|Traditional end of the [[Viking Age]]\n|}\n\n===Rise===\nHedeby became a principal marketplace because of its geographical location on the major trade routes between the [[Frankish Empire]] and [[Scandinavia]] (north-south), and between the [[Baltic Sea|Baltic]] and the [[North Sea]] (east-west). Between 800 and 1000 the growing economic power of the [[Vikings]] led to its dramatic expansion as a major trading centre. Along with [[Birka]] and [[Schleswig]], Hedeby's prominence as a major international trading hub served as a foundation of the [[Hanseatic League]] that would emerge by the 12th century.<ref>{{cite thesis |last=Smith |first=Jillian R. |date=May 2010 |title=Hanseatic Cogs and Baltic Trade: Interrelations Between Trade, Technology and Ecology |type= |chapter=2 |publisher=University of Nebraska at Lincoln |docket= |oclc= |url=http://digitalcommons.unl.edu/anthrotheses/4 |access-date=1 July 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe following indicate the importance achieved by the town:\n* The town was described by visitors from England ([[Wulfstan of Hedeby|Wulfstan]] - 9th century) and the Mediterranean ([[Ibrahim ibn Yaqub al-Tartushi|Al-Tartushi]] - 10th century).\n* Hedeby became the seat of a bishop (948) and belonged to the Archbishopric of [[Hamburg]] and [[Archdiocese of Bremen|Bremen]].\n* The town minted its own coins (from 825).\n* [[Adam of Bremen]] (11th century) reports that ships were sent from this ''portus maritimus'' to Slavic lands, to [[Sweden]], [[Sambia Peninsula|Samland]] (''Semlant'') and even [[Greece]].\n\nA Swedish dynasty founded by [[Olof the Brash]] is said to have ruled Hedeby during the last decades of the 9th century and the first part of the 10th century. This was told to [[Adam of Bremen]] by the Danish king [[Sweyn Estridsson]], and it is supported by three [[runestone]]s found in Denmark. Two of them were raised by the mother of Olof's grandson [[Sigtrygg Gnupasson]]. The third runestone, discovered in 1796, is from Hedeby, the ''[[Stone of Eric]]'' ({{lang-sv|Erikstenen}}).  It is inscribed with [[Runic alphabet#Younger Fu\u00feark|Norwegian-Swedish runes]]. It is, however, possible that Danes also occasionally wrote with this version of the [[Runic alphabet#Younger Fu\u00feark|younger futhark]].\n\n===Lifestyle===\nLife was short and crowded in Hedeby. The small houses were clustered tightly together in a grid, with the east-west streets leading down to jetties in the harbour. People rarely lived beyond 30 or 40, and archaeological research shows that their later years were often painful due to crippling diseases such as tuberculosis.<ref>{{cite web|author=Consulate General of Denmark in New York |title=Factsheet |url=http://www.denmark.org/about_denmark/factsheets_articles/factsheets_vikings.html |accessdate=January 14, 2006 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060113013845/http://www.denmark.org/about_denmark/factsheets_articles/factsheets_vikings.html |archivedate=January 13, 2006 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Yet make-up for men and rights for women provide surprises to the modern understanding.\n\n[[Ibrahim ibn Yaqub al-Tartushi|Al-Tartushi]], a late  10th-century traveller from [[al-Andalus]], provides one of the most colourful and often quoted descriptions of life in Hedeby. Al-Tartushi was from [[C\u00f3rdoba, Spain|Cordoba]] in [[Spain]], which had a significantly more wealthy and comfortable lifestyle than Hedeby. While Hedeby may have been significant by Scandinavian standards, Al-Tartushi was unimpressed:\n:''\"Slesvig (Hedeby) is a very large town at the extreme end of the world ocean... The inhabitants worship Sirius, except for a minority of Christians who have a church of their own there.... He who slaughters a sacrificial animal puts up poles at the door to his courtyard and impales the animal on them, be it a piece of cattle, a ram, billy goat or a pig so that his neighbours will be aware that he is making a sacrifice in honour of his god. The town is poor in goods and riches. People eat mainly fish which exist in abundance. Babies are thrown into the sea for reasons of economy. The right to divorce belongs to the women.... Artificial eye make-up is another peculiarity; when they wear it their beauty never disappears, indeed it is enhanced in both men and women.

Excavations were conducted for the next 15 years. Further excavations were carried out between 1930 and 1939. Archaeological work on the site was productive for two main reasons: that the site had never been built on since its destruction some 840 years earlier, and that the permanently waterlogged ground had preserved wood and other perishable materials. After the Second World War, in 1959, archaeological work was started again and has continued intermittently ever since. The embankments surrounding the settlement were excavated, and the harbour was partially dredged, during which the wreck of a [[Viking ship]] was discovered. Despite all this work, only 5% of the settlement (and only 1% of the harbour) has as yet been investigated.\n\nThe most important finds resulting from the excavations are now on display in the adjoining [[Hedeby Viking Museum|Haithabu Museum]].\n\n[[File:Hedebyhouses010.jpg|thumb|right|Reconstructed houses]]\n\n===21st-century reconstructions===\nIn 2005 an ambitious archaeological reconstruction program was initiated on the original site.

The ''ALGOL 68'' transput library recognizes the following standard files/devices: <code>stand in</code>, <code>stand out</code>, <code>stand errors</code> and <code>stand back</code>.\n\nAn alternative to special primitive functions is the [[I/O monad]], which permits programs to just describe I/O, and the actions are carried out outside the program. This is notable because the {{nowrap|I/O}} functions would introduce [[side-effect (computer science)|side-effect]]s to any programming language, but this allows [[purely functional programming]] to be practical.\n\n== Channel I/O ==\n[[Channel I/O]] requires the use of instructions that are specifically designed to perform I/O operations. The I/O instructions address the channel or the channel and device; the channel asynchronously accesses all other required addressing and control information. This is similar to DMA, but more flexible.\n\n== Port-mapped I/O ==\n[[Memory-mapped I/O|Port-mapped I/O]] also requires the use of special I/O instructions. Typically one or more ports are assigned to the device, each with a special purpose. The port numbers are in a separate address space from that used by normal instructions.\n\n==Direct memory access==\n[[Direct memory access]] (DMA) is a means for devices to transfer large chunks of data to and from memory independently of the CPU.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Asynchronous I/O]]\n* [[I/O bound]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Input output}}\n[[Category:Input/output]]\n", "name_user": "Jarble", "label": "safe", "comment": "linking", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Input/output"}
