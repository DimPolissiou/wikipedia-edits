{"title_page": "And That's Why We Drink Podcast", "text_new": "{{Fanpov|date=March 2020}}\n\n'''And That's Why We Drink''' (ATWWD) is a comedy true crime and paranormal [[Podcast|podcas]]<nowiki/>t created by Christine Schiefer and Em Schulz.\n\nThe show has been in production since February 2017. It currently updates every Sunday on a variety of podcast platforms as well as a [[YouTube]] channel where video recordings of the podcast's audio recording sessions have been uploaded since October 2019. Since its launch the show has seen over one million downloads <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.sacurrent.com/ArtSlut/archives/2020/01/27/true-crime-and-paranormal-podcast-and-thats-why-we-drink-brings-scary-stories-to-the-aztec-theatre-this-friday|title=True Crime and Paranormal Podcast And That's Why We Drink Brings Scary Stories to the Aztec Theatre This Friday|last=Nelson|first=Kelly Merka|website=San Antonio Current|language=en|access-date=2020-03-02}}</ref> and has spawned two live tours through the United States and Canada.\n\nIn May 2019, the podcast won People's Choice for best podcast at the 23rd annual [[Webby Award]]<nowiki/>s.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.webbyawards.com/winners/2019/podcasts-digital-audio/general-podcasts/comedy/|title=Comedy|language=en-US|access-date=2020-03-02}}</ref>\n\n== Format and Production ==\nThe podcast is divided into two main sections. The first is the [[paranormal]] section, in which Schulz discusses a paranormal story, often dealing with suspected [[haunted house|haunted]] locations, [[Extraterrestrial life|alien]] or [[Unidentified flying object|UFO]] sightings, [[Cryptozoology|cryptids]] and occasionally [[Conspiracy theory|conspiracy theories]] or [[Creepypasta|creepy pastas]]. This is followed by Schiefer's [[true crime]] portion of the show in which she covers [[murder]]s, [[serial killer]]s, [[unsolved crime]]s{{disambiguation needed|date=April 2020}} and abductions. The two friends often tell stories about their lives as well, often asking each other \"why do you drink\" and discussing their adventures together.\n\nOriginally, the two hosts also divided themselves into \"team [[wine]]\" and \"team [[milkshake]],\" as Schiefer often imbibes alcoholic drinks during the recording sessions, while Schulz, a [[Teetotalism|teetotaler]], would drink a variety of milkshakes. While this is still a way for the hosts to identify their respective fan bases, in later episodes of the show, the practice of drinking wine or milkshakes was mostly abandoned.\n\nOnce per month the show deviates from the normal format to present \"Lstener Stories\" in which the hosts read and react to stories of crimes and the paranormal submitted by fans, often with a theme requested by Schiefer. These stories are chosen by the duo's assistant Eva Gross, and the hosts claim to have not read the stories before their recording sessions, so as to provide their genuine spur of the moment reactions to the stories {{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\nATWWD occasionally features special guests, including Schiefer's brother Alexander (who also co-hosts the podcast [[Beach too Sandy, Water too Wet]] with Schiefer), her husband Blaise Lampugnalle, and the couple's dog Gio, as well as Schulz's girlfriend Allison Goforth and childhood friend Deirdre Klima. Comedian [[Lisa Lampanelli]], who is Schiefer's aunt-in-law has also guest starred, and the podcast has done several crossover episodes with the [[Wine and Crime]] podcast.\n\n== Activism and Causes ==\nThe show has served the hosts as a platform for several causes. Schiefer, who suffers from [[Crohn's disease|Crohn's Disease]] has been outspoken about her health and her need for frequent [[Colonoscopy|colonoscopies]]. Schulz, who uses \"they/them\" pronouns has been an advocate for the normalization of pronouns, not just within the [[LGBT|LGBTQ]]+ community but also by the general public. Both hosts have also been open about their mental health struggles, often discussing their anxiety, their visits to therapists and their use of mental health medications.\n\n== Episode List ==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Regular Show Episodes\n!\n!Episode Title\n!Paranormal Topic\n!True Crime Topic\n!Release Date\n|-\n|1.\n|Frances Ford \"Cupola\" and the Off-Brand [[Kool-Aid]]\n|[[Winchester Mystery House]]\n|[[Jonestown]] Cult Suicide\n|2/09/2017\n|-\n|2.\n|Clothesline Cookies and the Lone [[Band-Aid]]\n|[[Whaley House (San Diego, California)|Whaley House]]\n|[[Robert Durst]]\n|2/15/2017\n|-\n|3.\n|Paranormal Bitchslaps and the Body Examiners\n|[[Bell Witch|The Bell Witch]]\n|[[Black Dahlia]]\n|2/19/2017\n|-\n|4.\n|Demon Pigs and a Call from Tamara\n|Amityville Haunting\n|[[Sodder children disappearance|Sodder Children]]\n|2/26/2019\n|-\n|5.\n|The \"Creepy Little Thing\" and a Journey of Self-Destruction\n|[[Smurl haunting|Smurl Poltergeist]]\n|[[John Wayne Gacy]]\n|3/5/2017\n|-\n|6.\n|The Human Hair Version and the Worst Social Studies Class Ever\n|[[Robert (doll)|Robert the Doll]]\n|[[Elizabeth Smart]] Kidnapping\n|3/12/2017\n|-\n|7.\n|A [[Menorah (Temple)|Menorah]] Made of Lava and the [[Jerry Springer]] of Germany\n|[[Eastern State Penitentiary]]\n|[[Hinterkaifeck murders|Hinterkaifeck]] Massacre\n|3/19/2017\n|-\n|8.\n|Our First Fight and Franzia Stains... or Blood\n|[[Queen Mary (ship)|Queen Mary Ship]]\n|[[Disappearance of Maura Murray|Maura Murray]] Disappearance\n|3/26/2016\n|-\n|9.\n|The Wandering Cowboy and the Pregnancy Pact, but for Boys\n|[[The Sallie House|Sallie House]]\n|Michael Malloy\n|4/2/2017\n|-\n|10.\n|Annabelle the Doll-y Parton Impersonator and the Tap Water Scammer\n|[[Annabelle (doll)|Annabelle]] the Doll\n|[[H.

comedy true crime and paranormal [[Podcast|podcas]]<nowiki/>t created by Christine Schiefer and Em Schulz.\n\nThe show has been in production since February 2017. It currently updates every Sunday on a variety of podcast platforms as well as a [[YouTube]] channel where video recordings of the podcast's audio recording sessions have been uploaded since October of 2019. Since its launch the show has seen over one million downloads <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.sacurrent.com/ArtSlut/archives/2020/01/27/true-crime-and-paranormal-podcast-and-thats-why-we-drink-brings-scary-stories-to-the-aztec-theatre-this-friday|title=True Crime and Paranormal Podcast And That's Why We Drink Brings Scary Stories to the Aztec Theatre This Friday|last=Nelson|first=Kelly Merka|website=San Antonio Current|language=en|access-date=2020-03-02}}</ref> and has spawned two live tours through the United States and Canada.\n\nIn May of 2019, the podcast won People's Choice for best podcast at the 23rd annual [[Webby Award]]<nowiki/>s.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.webbyawards.com/winners/2019/podcasts-digital-audio/general-podcasts/comedy/|title=Comedy|language=en-US|access-date=2020-03-02}}</ref>\n\n== Format and Production ==\nThe podcast is divided into two main sections. The first is the [[paranormal]] section, in which Schulz discusses a paranormal story, often dealing with suspected [[haunted house|haunted]] locations, [[Extraterrestrial life|alien]] or [[Unidentified flying object|UFO]] sightings, [[Cryptozoology|cryptids]] and occasionally [[Conspiracy theory|conspiracy theories]] or [[Creepypasta|creepy pastas]]. This is followed by Schiefer's [[true crime]] portion of the show in which she covers [[murder]]s, [[serial killer]]s, [[unsolved crime]]s{{dn|date=April 2020}} and abductions. The two friends often tell stories about their lives as well, often asking each other \"why do you drink\" and discussing their adventures together.\n\nOriginally, the two hosts also divided themselves into \"team [[wine]]\" and \"team [[milkshake]],\" as Schiefer often imbibes alcoholic drinks during the recording sessions, while Schulz, a [[Teetotalism|teetotaler]], would drink a variety of milkshakes. While this is still a way for the hosts to identify their respective fan bases, in later episodes of the show, the practice of drinking wine or milkshakes was mostly abandoned.\n\nOnce per month the show deviates from the normal format to present \"Lstener Stories\" in which the hosts read and react to stories of crimes and the paranormal submitted by fans, often with a theme requested by Schiefer. These stories are chosen by the duo's assistant Eva Gross, and the hosts claim to have not read the stories before their recording sessions, so as to provide their genuine spur of the moment reactions to the stories {{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\nATWWD occasionally features special guests, including Schiefer's brother Alexander (who also co-hosts the podcast [[Beach too Sandy, Water too Wet]] with Schiefer), her husband Blaise Lampugnalle, and the couple's dog Gio, as well as Schulz's girlfriend Allison Goforth and childhood friend Deirdre Klima. Comedian [[Lisa Lampanelli]], who is Schiefer's aunt-in-law has also guest starred, and the podcast has done several crossover episodes with the [[Wine and Crime]] podcast.\n\n== Activism and Causes ==\nThe show has served the hosts as a platform for several causes. Schiefer, who suffers from [[Crohn's disease|Crohn's Disease]] has been outspoken about her health and her need for frequent [[Colonoscopy|colonoscopies]]. Schulz, who uses \"they/them\" pronouns has been an advocate for the normalization of pronouns, not just within the [[LGBT|LGBTQ]]+ community but also by the general public. Both hosts have also been open about their mental health struggles, often discussing their anxiety, their visits to therapists and their use of mental health medications.\n\n== Episode List ==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Regular Show Episodes\n!\n!Episode Title\n!Paranormal Topic\n!True Crime Topic\n!Release Date\n|-\n|1.\n|Frances Ford \"Cupola\" and the Off-Brand [[Kool-Aid]]\n|[[Winchester Mystery House]]\n|[[Jonestown]] Cult Suicide\n|2/09/2017\n|-\n|2.\n|Clothesline Cookies and the Lone [[Band-Aid]]\n|[[Whaley House (San Diego, California)|Whaley House]]\n|[[Robert Durst]]\n|2/15/2017\n|-\n|3.\n|Paranormal Bitchslaps and the Body Examiners\n|[[Bell Witch|The Bell Witch]]\n|[[Black Dahlia]]\n|2/19/2017\n|-\n|4.\n|Demon Pigs and a Call from Tamara\n|Amityville Haunting\n|[[Sodder children disappearance|Sodder Children]]\n|2/26/2019\n|-\n|5.\n|The \"Creepy Little Thing\" and a Journey of Self-Destruction\n|[[Smurl haunting|Smurl Poltergeist]]\n|[[John Wayne Gacy]]\n|3/5/2017\n|-\n|6.\n|The Human Hair Version and the Worst Social Studies Class Ever\n|[[Robert (doll)|Robert the Doll]]\n|[[Elizabeth Smart]] Kidnapping\n|3/12/2017\n|-\n|7.\n|A [[Menorah (Temple)|Menorah]] Made of Lava and the [[Jerry Springer]] of Germany\n|[[Eastern State Penitentiary]]\n|[[Hinterkaifeck murders|Hinterkaifeck]] Massacre\n|3/19/2017\n|-\n|8.\n|Our First Fight and Franzia Stains... or Blood\n|[[Queen Mary (ship)|Queen Mary Ship]]\n|[[Disappearance of Maura Murray|Maura Murray]] Disappearance\n|3/26/2016\n|-\n|9.\n|The Wandering Cowboy and the Pregnancy Pact, but for Boys\n|[[The Sallie House|Sallie House]]\n|Michael Malloy\n|4/2/2017\n|-\n|10.\n|Annabelle the Doll-y Parton Impersonator and the Tap Water Scammer\n|[[Annabelle (doll)|Annabelle]] the Doll\n|[[H.

[[Walmersley]] and [[Shuttleworth, Greater Manchester|Shuttleworth]] were given to the Lord of Bury; [[Musbury Valley|Musbury]] and [[Cowpe]] with Lench in the north were ceded to [[Blackburnshire]]. The Manor of Tottington eventually formed part of the [[Honour of Clitheroe]], which in turn became part of the eventual [[Duchy of Lancaster]]. When the [[Duke of Lancaster]] seized the throne to become [[Henry IV of England|Henry IV]] the duchy became royal and the Manor of Tottington with it.<ref name=\"Lancashire Life\" />\n\nTottington Hall is first recorded in 1504, as the residence of the Nuttall family. The Nuttall family's fortunes improved throughout the [[Tudor period|Tudor]] and [[Stuart period]]s and in 1715 Thomas Nuttall built the first school in Tottington. In 1770 the hall and its estates were bought by John Gorton, whose family had made their wealth in the cotton trade.<ref>[http://www.bury.gov.uk/CHttpHandler.ashx?id=6090&p=0 Town Meadow Park, Tottington] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923195343/http://www.bury.gov.uk/CHttpHandler.ashx?id=6090&p=0 |date=23 September 2015 }} Bury Council</ref> He brought his industrial expertise to Tottington, building Tottington Mill, Kirklees Mill and Leemings Hill Bleach Works; greatly contributing to the prosperity and expansion of the village in the [[Georgian period]].<ref>[http://www.village-link.com/-pics/walks/Brif%20Walk%20GREENMOUNT%20TO%20WALSHAW%209.pdf Greenmount to Walshaw] Walking Guide</ref> During this time the family financed the building of St Anne's Church and vicarage, and refurbished Tottington Hall leaving it much as it stands today. In 1863 the hall and grounds were put up for sale and came under the Roberts family before being bought by the recently formed Tottington Urban District Council in 1918 for \u00a32,750.

This continued until 1955 when viscose production ceased. [[Courtaulds]] took over the mill in 1962 and converted it into a dye-house, this work continued until 1980.

'Hobby' horses were in full swing behind the Printers' Arms, and a large swing boat caused merriment, the plumber's and confectioner's shops were not built then.

In 1888 the line was taken over by the [[Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway]] and [[Tottington railway station]] remained open until the line closed for passengers in 1952 and goods in 1963. On 16 September 1904 an electric tram service was introduced running along Market Street between Bury and Tottington by [[Bury Corporation Tramways]]; in response to this competition the following year the railway introduced new rolling stock and increased the number of 'halts' on the line such as at [[Sunny Wood Halt railway station|Sunnywood]].

Directly north-west, Affetside Moor rises to a height of more than 900&nbsp;ft above sea level and further north Top of Quarlton and Holcombe Moor dominate the skyline. From elevated parts of the town Scout Moor, Harden Moor and Knowl Hill are visible to the east. The villages of Affetside, Greenmount and Hawkshaw are north of the town, with Walshaw to the south west. Until the post-war period Tottington was a ribbon development along the Bury to Blackburn road, the Kirklees Valley to the east stopped development in that direction and kept Tottington distinct from [[Brandlesholme]]. Within the Kirklees Valley there are a number of artificial mill ponds and reservoirs created during Tottington's industrial heyday. Many of these have since dried up, but the remaining examples have proven an ideal habitat for numerous species of wildfowl and bats.<ref>[http://www.slbg.org.uk/Technical%20Report%202007.pdf Bat Activity Survey over millponds in South Lancashire] South Lancashire Bat Group</ref>\n\nThe [[superficial deposits|superficial geology]] beneath Tottington consists of [[Devensian]] [[glacial till]]s, which overlie the [[Pennine Coal Measures Group|Lower Pennine Coal Measures]]; the same sequences of [[sandstones]], [[mudstones]] and [[coal seam]]s that form the [[Lancashire Coalfield]].

Changes from western (I\u00f1upiaq) to eastern dialects are marked by the dropping of vestigial Yupik-related features, increasing consonant assimilation (e.g., ''kumlu'', meaning \"thumb\", changes to ''kuvlu'', changes to ''kublu'',<ref name=livingdict/> changes to ''kulluk'',<ref name=livingdict/> changes to ''kulluq''<ref name=livingdict>{{cite web|url=http://www.livingdictionary.com/search/viewResults.jsp?language=en&searchString=thumb&languageSet=all |title=thumb|work=Asuilaak Living Dictionary|accessdate=2007-11-25}}</ref>), and increased consonant lengthening, and lexical change.

Changes from western (I\u00f1upiaq) to eastern dialects are marked by the dropping of vestigial Yupik-related features, increasing consonant assimilation (e.g., ''kumlu'', meaning \"thumb\", changes to ''kuvlu'', changes to ''kublu'',<ref name=livingdict/> changes to ''kulluk'',<ref name=livingdict/> changes to ''kulluq''<ref name=livingdict>{{cite web|url=http://www.livingdictionary.com/search/viewResults.jsp?language=en&searchString=thumb&languageSet=all |title=thumb|work=Asuilaak Living Dictionary|accessdate=2007-11-25}}</ref>), and increased consonant lengthening, and lexical change. Thus, speakers of two adjacent Inuit dialects would usually be able to understand one another, but speakers from dialects distant from each other on the dialect continuum would have difficulty understanding one another.<ref name=\"kaplanB\"/> [[Seward Peninsula]] dialects in western Alaska, where much of the [[I\u00f1upiat]] culture has been in place for perhaps less than 500 years, are greatly affected by phonological influence from the Yupik languages.

They demonstrate limited mutual intelligibility.<ref name=\"FortecueM\"/> Additionally, both Alutiiq and Central Yup'ik have considerable dialect diversity. The northernmost Yupik languages \u2013 Siberian Yupik and Naukan Yupik \u2013 are linguistically only slightly closer to Inuit than is Alutiiq, which is the southernmost of the Yupik languages. Although the grammatical structures of Yupik and Inuit languages are similar, they have pronounced differences phonologically.
