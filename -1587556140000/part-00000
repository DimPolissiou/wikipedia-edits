The resultant design was top-heavy and unstable, resulting in the 1934 ''Tomozuru'' Incident, in which one of the ''Chidori''-class vessels capsized. The subsequent investigation revealed the fundamental design flaw, and the four vessels in the class which had been completed were extensively rebuilt, and the remaining sixteen vessels projected were cancelled in favor of a new design which would address these design issues from the beginning. Sixteen ''\u014ctori''-class vessels were ordered in the 1934 [[2nd Naval Armaments Supplement Programme]], of which eight were completed between 1936 and 1937.

The resultant design was top-heavy and unstable, resulting in the 1934 ''Tomozuru'' Incident, in which one of the ''Chidori''-class vessels capsized. The subsequent investigation revealed the fundamental design flaw, and the four vessels in the class which had been completed were extensively rebuilt, and the remaining sixteen vessels projected were cancelled in favor of a new design which would address these design issues from the beginning. Sixteen ''\u014ctori''-class vessels were ordered in the 1934 [[2nd Naval Armaments Supplement Programme]], of which eight were completed between 1936 and 1937.

The [[Geneva Bible]] (1560) uses \"wicked,\" and at Jg 19:22 has the marginal note \"''Ebr'' [Hebrew] ''men of Belial: that is, given to all wickednes.''\" In the KJV these occurrences are rendered with \"Belial\" capitalised:\n* \"the sons of Eli were '''sons of Belial''' \" (KJV)\nIn modern versions these are usually read as a phrase:\n*\"the sons of Eli were '''worthless men''' \" (1 Samuel 2:12, NRSV and NIV)\n*\"the wicked men of the city\" (Judges 19:22, NIV)\n\n\"Belial\" is applied to ideas, words, and counsel,<ref>De 15:9; Ps 101:3; Na 1:11</ref> to calamitous circumstances,<ref>Ps 41:8</ref> and most frequently, to worthless men of the lowest sort, such as men who would induce worship of other gods;<ref>De 13:13</ref> those of Benjamin who committed the sex crime at Gibeah;<ref>Jg 19:22-27; 20:13</ref> the wicked sons of Eli;<ref>1Sa 2:12</ref> insolent Nabal;<ref>1Sa 25:17, 25</ref> opposers of [[God in Judaism|God]]\u2019s anointed, David;<ref>2Sa 20:1; 22:5; 23:6; Ps 18:4</ref> Rehoboam's unsteady associates;<ref>2Ch 13:7</ref> Jezebel's conspirators against Naboth;<ref>1Ki 21:10, 13</ref> and men in general who stir up contention.<ref>Pr 6:12-14; 16:27; 19:28</ref> Indicating that the enemy power would no longer interfere with the carrying out of true worship by his people in their land, YHWH declared through his prophet: \"No more will any worthless person pass again through you.

XIII (=4Q495 2), 10-12</ref> one of the [[Dead Sea scrolls]], Belial is the leader of the Sons of Darkness:\n\n<blockquote>\"You made Belial for the pit, angel of enmity; in darkness is his domain, his counsel is to bring about wickedness and guilt.

I shall not retain Belial within my heart.\"\n\nThe ''War Scroll'' and ''the Thanksgiving hymns'' both delve into the idea that Belial is accursed by God and his people, and shows how the existence of Belial in this world can be attributed to the mysteries of God since we can not know why he permits the dealings of Belial to persist.\n\nIn the ''Dead Sea Scrolls'', Belial is further contrasted with God. These are the Angel of Light and the Angel of Darkness. The Manual of Discipline identifies the Angel of Light as God himself. The Angel of Darkness is identified in the same scroll as Belial.<ref name=\"Dead Sea\"/>\n\nAlso in ''The Dead Sea Scrolls'' is a recounting of a dream of [[Amram]], the father of [[Moses]], who finds two 'watchers' contesting over him. One is Belial who is described as the King of Evil and Prince of Darkness. Belial is also mentioned in the ''Fragments of a Zadokite Work'' (which is also known as The [[Damascus Document]] (CD)), which states that during the [[eschatological]] age, \"Belial shall be let loose against Israel, as God spoke through [[Isaiah]] the prophet.\"<ref>CD 4:13</ref> The ''Fragments'' also speak of \"three nets of Belial\" which are said to be fornication, wealth, and pollution of the sanctuary.<ref>CD 4:17-18</ref> In this work, Belial is sometimes presented as an agent of divine punishment and sometimes as a rebel, as [[Mastema]] is. It was Belial who inspired the Egyptian sorcerers, Jochaneh and his brother, to oppose Moses and Aaron. The ''Fragments'' also say that anyone who is ruled by the spirits of Belial and speaks of rebellion should be condemned as a [[necromancy|necromancer]] and wizard.\n\n===Jubilees===\nIn the [[Book of Jubilees]], [[circumcision|uncircumcised]] [[Gentile]]s are called \"sons of Belial\".<ref>[http://www.pseudepigrapha.com/jubilees/15.htm Jubilees 15:32]</ref>\n\n===Testament of the Twelve Patriarchs===\nBelial is also mentioned in the [[Testaments of the Twelve Patriarchs]]. The author of the work seems to be a [[dualistic cosmology|dualist]] because he presents Belial as God's opponent, not as a servant, but does not mention how or why this came to be. Simeon 5:3 says that fornication separates man from God and brings him near to Belial. Levi tells his children to choose between the Law of God and the works of Belial<ref>Levi 19:1</ref> It also states that when the soul is constantly disturbed, the Lord departs from it and Belial rules over it. Naphtali<ref>2:6, 3:1</ref> contrasts the Law and will of God with the purposes of Belial. Also, in 20:2, Joseph prophesies that when [[Israel]] leaves [[ancient Egypt|Egypt]], they will be with God in light while Belial will remain in darkness with the Egyptians. Finally, the Testament describes that when the Messiah comes, the angels will punish the spirits of deceit and Belial<ref>3:3</ref> and that the Messiah will bind Belial and give to his children the power to trample the evil spirits.<ref>18:12</ref> {{quote|1=\"For many hath fornication destroyed; because, though a man be old or noble, it maketh him a reproach and a laughing-stock with Beliar and the sons of men.\"<ref>4:7-8</ref>}}\n\n===Ascension of Isaiah===\nIn the [[Ascension of Isaiah]], Belial is the angel of [[Antinomianism|lawlessness]] and \"the ruler of this world\", and identified as [[Samael]] and [[Satan]].<ref name=\"earlychristianwritings.com\"/>\n\n{{quote|And Manasseh turned aside his heart to serve Belial; for the angel of lawlessness, who is the ruler of this world, is Belial, whose name is Matanbuchus.|(Ascension of Isaiah 2:4)<ref name=\"earlychristianwritings.com\"/>}}\n\n==Christianity==\nIn the [[New Testament]] the word occurs once, when [[Paul the Apostle]] asks:\n* \"[W]hat concord hath Christ with Belial? or what part hath he that believeth with an infidel?\" ({{Bibleverse|2|Corinthians|6:15|KJV}})\n\nThe spelling found in most manuscripts of 2 Corinthians is actually ''Beliar'' (\u0392\u03b5\u03bb\u03b9\u03ac\u03c1) not ''Belial'' (\u0392\u03b5\u03bb\u03af\u03b1\u03bb). This is the reading preferred by textual scholars<ref>Metzger</ref> and the change of -l to -r is attributed to a common change in Aramaic pronunciation.<ref>Neil Forsyth ''The Old Enemy: Satan and the Combat Myth'' Princeton 1987 Page 201 \"The form Beliar(c.g., 2 Cor. 6.15) is due to Syriac pronunciation.\"</ref><ref>[[Marvin R.

The single New Testament use is preserved \"Belial\" in Latin and Syriac.\n\n===Resurrection of Jesus Christ (by Bartholomew)===\nIn the [[Resurrection of Jesus Christ (by Bartholomew)]] of the [[New Testament apocrypha]], Belial was visible along with 666 [[fallen angel]]s when [[Michael (archangel)|Michael]] was commanded by [[Jesus]] to show [[Hell]] to his [[Disciple (Christianity)|disciples]].\n\n==Rabbinical literature==\nThe [[Talmud]] and rabbinical interpretation generally follow a non-supernatural view, an allegorical personification of evil, as with rabbinical interpretations of evil.

In ''The Satanic Bible'' (''The Book of Belial''), Belial means \"without a master\", and symbolizes independence, self-sufficiency, and personal accomplishment.\n\nIn 1937, [[Edgar Cayce]] used the term \"sons of belial\" and \"sons of the law of one\" for the first time in one of his deep trance readings given between 1923 and 1945. Cayce was often referred to as the \"sleeping prophet\" who gave over 2,500 readings to individuals while in a deep trance state.  While his definition of the sons of belial was consistent with the Hebrew meaning of \"worthless\" individuals focused on self-gratification, Cayce went on to use the term frequently to compare opposing human forces at work in pre-historical times related to the early development of [[Atlantis]].\n\n==Popular culture==\n{{main|Belial in popular culture}}\nPopular culture in the [[20th Century]] included many references to Belial; notably in the celebrated silent film ''[[Nosferatu]]'' (1922), [[Aldous Huxley]]'s novel ''[[Ape and Essence]]'' (1948), [[Philip K. Dick]]'s novel ''[[The Divine Invasion]]'' (1981), the cult horror film ''[[Basket Case (film)|Basket Case]]'' (1982), [[Dean Koontz]]'s novel ''[[Phantoms (novel)|Phantoms]]'' (1983), and [[Graham Masterton]]'s novel ''Master of Lies'' (1991). Belial has also experienced a resurgence in popularity during the 21st Century in numerous mediums, with video games being the most prominent.\n\n* In the 2005 horror film, ''[[The Exorcism of Emily Rose]]'', Belial is featured as the Devil's representative who possesses the title character and kills the priest that eventually banishes him.\n* In the real time strategy game ''Dungeon Keeper'''s Deeper Dungeons expansion the final level is titled \u201cBelial\u201d.\n* In the role playing game ''[[Vampire: the Requiem]]'', Belial's Brood is a covenant of vampires that serve Vice and evil forces, consorting with infernal spirits for power.\n* [[Blizzard Entertainment]]'s video game ''[[Diablo 3]]'' has Belial function as the final boss of Act 2 in its storyline. In the City of Caldeum, where Belial takes residence, there are definite Arabic tones for the art direction and setting in the aforementioned chapter. Also known as the \"Lord of Lies\" and the \"Master of Deception\", Belial is regarded as one of the four Lesser Evils in the mortal realm that seek to make this world an outpost of Hell itself..\n* [[Westwood Studios]]'s PC game ''[[Lands of Lore: Guardians of Destiny]]'' features Belial as its main antagonist, portraying him as an evil god with a devil-like appearance.\n* In the ''[[Warhammer 40k]]'' universe Belial is the current Grand Master of the Deathwing of the Dark Angels Space Marine Chapter which has other characters named after bleaker Abrahamic entities, such as Samael, the poison of God, and Azrael, the Angel of Death.\n* In the mobile game ''Puzzle and Dragons'', Belial is a monster that is part of the Archdemon series.\n* In the book ''The Little Ships'' by [[J.A. Sutherland]], the main character sails in a spaceship named Belial.\n* \"Belial's Meat\" is a health item in the video game ''[[Off (video game)|Off]]'' by Unproductive Fun Time.\n* In the video game ''[[Binding of isaac (game)|Binding of Isaac]]'', the Book of Belial is an activated item.\n* In the mobile game ''[[Crash Fever]]'', Belial is one of the first protagonists.\n* In ''[[Granblue Fantasy]]'', Belial is a \"fallen angel\", appearing in the What Makes The Sky Blue 2 and 3 event(s) as one of the main antagonists.\n* \"Belial\" is the theme held in meditation by Vaughn Benjamin (Akae Beka) on the Midnite & Ras L Collaborative album ''Thru & True'' (2006).\n* Belial is referenced, among other demons, on [[Mayhem (band)|Mayhem]]'s 2014 studio album ''[[Esoteric Warfare]]''. Belial is mentioned in \"Pandaemon,\" the fourth track on the LP.\n* In Cassandra Clare's bestselling [[Shadowhunter Chronicles]], Belial is one of the [[Prince of Hell]] as well as the demonic father of a major character, Theresa Gray, who was the protagonist of [[The Infernal Devices]]. In ''[[Shadowhunters]]'', the television adaptation of the novel series, Belial is the demonic father of a supporting character in season 3, the warlock Lorenzo Rey. Belial is mentioned as Lorenzo's father in the episode \"City of Glass\".\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of theological demons]]\n* [[Asmodai]]\n* [[Bel (mythology)|Bel]]\n* [[Demon]]\n* [[Devil]]\n* [[Samael]]\n* [[Satan]]\n* [[Serpent (Bible)|Serpent]]\n* [[Sin]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n*S.

The [[Geneva Bible]] (1560) uses \"wicked,\" and at Jg 19:22 has the marginal note \"''Ebr'' [Hebrew] ''men of Belial: that is, given to all wickednes.''\" In the KJV these occurrences are rendered with \"Belial\" capitalised:\n* \"the sons of Eli were '''sons of Belial''' \" (KJV)\nIn modern versions these are usually read as a phrase:\n*\"the sons of Eli were '''worthless men''' \" (1 Samuel 2:12, NRSV and NIV)\n*\"the wicked men of the city\" (Judges 19:22, NIV)\n\n\"Belial\" is applied to ideas, words, and counsel,<ref>De 15:9; Ps 101:3; Na 1:11</ref> to calamitous circumstances,<ref>Ps 41:8</ref> and most frequently, to worthless men of the lowest sort, such as men who would induce worship of other gods;<ref>De 13:13</ref> those of Benjamin who committed the sex crime at Gibeah;<ref>Jg 19:22-27; 20:13</ref> the wicked sons of Eli;<ref>1Sa 2:12</ref> insolent Nabal;<ref>1Sa 25:17, 25</ref> opposers of [[God in Judaism|God]]\u2019s anointed, David;<ref>2Sa 20:1; 22:5; 23:6; Ps 18:4</ref> Rehoboam's unsteady associates;<ref>2Ch 13:7</ref> Jezebel's conspirators against Naboth;<ref>1Ki 21:10, 13</ref> and men in general who stir up contention.<ref>Pr 6:12-14; 16:27; 19:28</ref> Indicating that the enemy power would no longer interfere with the carrying out of true worship by his people in their land, YHWH declared through his prophet: \"No more will any worthless person pass again through you. In his entirety he will certainly be cut off.\"<ref>Na 1:15; see also 1Sa 1:16; 10:27; 30:22; Job 34:18</ref>\n\n==Second Temple period==\nThe term ''belial'' appears frequently in Jewish texts of the [[Second Temple]] period (texts classified by Christians as the Old Testament [[pseudepigrapha]] and [[apocrypha]]).<ref name=\"oxford\"/> Also a large number of references to Belial are evidenced in the Dead Sea Scrolls discovered at [[Qumran]] from 1948.\n\n===Dead Sea Scrolls===\nIn ''[[War of the Sons of Light Against the Sons of Darkness|The War of the Sons of Light Against the Sons of Darkness]]'',<ref>1QM, Col. XIII (=4Q495 2), 10-12</ref> one of the [[Dead Sea scrolls]], Belial is the leader of the Sons of Darkness:\n\n<blockquote>\"You made Belial for the pit, angel of enmity; in darkness is his domain, his counsel is to bring about wickedness and guilt.

B. Eerdmans Publishing Company]]|location=Grand Rapids, Michigan|date=2019|ISBN=978-0802877529|page=135}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn the ''Rules of the Community'', God is depicted as saying, \"I shall not comfort the oppressed until their path is perfect. I shall not retain Belial within my heart.\"\n\nThe ''War Scroll'' and ''the Thanksgiving hymns'' both delve into the idea that Belial is accursed by God and his people, and shows how the existence of Belial in this world can be attributed to the mysteries of God since we can not know why he permits the dealings of Belial to persist.\n\nIn the ''Dead Sea Scrolls'', Belial is further contrasted with God. These are the Angel of Light and the Angel of Darkness. The Manual of Discipline identifies the Angel of Light as God himself. The Angel of Darkness is identified in the same scroll as Belial.<ref name=\"Dead Sea\"/>\n\nAlso in ''The Dead Sea Scrolls'' is a recounting of a dream of [[Amram]], the father of [[Moses]], who finds two 'watchers' contesting over him. One is Belial who is described as the King of Evil and Prince of Darkness. Belial is also mentioned in the ''Fragments of a Zadokite Work'' (which is also known as The [[Damascus Document]] (CD)), which states that during the [[eschatological]] age, \"Belial shall be let loose against Israel, as God spoke through [[Isaiah]] the prophet.\"<ref>CD 4:13</ref> The ''Fragments'' also speak of \"three nets of Belial\" which are said to be fornication, wealth, and pollution of the sanctuary.<ref>CD 4:17-18</ref> In this work, Belial is sometimes presented as an agent of divine punishment and sometimes as a rebel, as [[Mastema]] is. It was Belial who inspired the Egyptian sorcerers, Jochaneh and his brother, to oppose Moses and Aaron. The ''Fragments'' also say that anyone who is ruled by the spirits of Belial and speaks of rebellion should be condemned as a [[necromancy|necromancer]] and wizard.\n\n===Jubilees===\nIn the [[Book of Jubilees]], [[circumcision|uncircumcised]] [[Gentile]]s are called \"sons of Belial\".<ref>[http://www.pseudepigrapha.com/jubilees/15.htm Jubilees 15:32]</ref>\n\n===Testament of the Twelve Patriarchs===\nBelial is also mentioned in the [[Testaments of the Twelve Patriarchs]]. The author of the work seems to be a [[dualistic cosmology|dualist]] because he presents Belial as God's opponent, not as a servant, but does not mention how or why this came to be. Simeon 5:3 says that fornication separates man from God and brings him near to Belial. Levi tells his children to choose between the Law of God and the works of Belial<ref>Levi 19:1</ref> It also states that when the soul is constantly disturbed, the Lord departs from it and Belial rules over it. Naphtali<ref>2:6, 3:1</ref> contrasts the Law and will of God with the purposes of Belial. Also, in 20:2, Joseph prophesies that when [[Israel]] leaves [[ancient Egypt|Egypt]], they will be with God in light while Belial will remain in darkness with the Egyptians. Finally, the Testament describes that when the Messiah comes, the angels will punish the spirits of deceit and Belial<ref>3:3</ref> and that the Messiah will bind Belial and give to his children the power to trample the evil spirits.<ref>18:12</ref> {{quote|1=\"For many hath fornication destroyed; because, though a man be old or noble, it maketh him a reproach and a laughing-stock with Beliar and the sons of men.\"<ref>4:7-8</ref>}}\n\n===Ascension of Isaiah===\nIn the [[Ascension of Isaiah]], Belial is the angel of [[Antinomianism|lawlessness]] and \"the ruler of this world\", and identified as [[Samael]] and [[Satan]].<ref name=\"earlychristianwritings.com\"/>\n\n{{quote|And Manasseh turned aside his heart to serve Belial; for the angel of lawlessness, who is the ruler of this world, is Belial, whose name is Matanbuchus.|(Ascension of Isaiah 2:4)<ref name=\"earlychristianwritings.com\"/>}}\n\n==Christianity==\nIn the [[New Testament]] the word occurs once, when [[Paul the Apostle]] asks:\n* \"[W]hat concord hath Christ with Belial? or what part hath he that believeth with an infidel?\" ({{Bibleverse|2|Corinthians|6:15|KJV}})\n\nThe spelling found in most manuscripts of 2 Corinthians is actually ''Beliar'' (\u0392\u03b5\u03bb\u03b9\u03ac\u03c1) not ''Belial'' (\u0392\u03b5\u03bb\u03af\u03b1\u03bb). This is the reading preferred by textual scholars<ref>Metzger</ref> and the change of -l to -r is attributed to a common change in Aramaic pronunciation.<ref>Neil Forsyth ''The Old Enemy: Satan and the Combat Myth'' Princeton 1987 Page 201 \"The form Beliar(c.g., 2 Cor. 6.15) is due to Syriac pronunciation.\"</ref><ref>[[Marvin R.

The single New Testament use is preserved \"Belial\" in Latin and Syriac.\n\n===Resurrection of Jesus Christ (by Bartholomew)===\nIn the [[Resurrection of Jesus Christ (by Bartholomew)]] of the [[New Testament apocrypha]], Belial was visible along with 666 [[fallen angel]]s when [[Michael (archangel)|Michael]] was commanded by [[Jesus]] to show [[Hell]] to his [[Disciple (Christianity)|disciples]].\n\n==Rabbinical literature==\nThe [[Talmud]] and rabbinical interpretation generally follow a non-supernatural view, an allegorical personification of evil, as with rabbinical interpretations of evil. The phrase \"sons of Belial\" from the [[Torah]] continued to retain currency.<ref>The censor, the editor, and the text: the Catholic Church and the ... - Page 218 Amnon Raz-Krakotzkin - 2007 \"Yosef Hacohen does not mention the issue of the printers but writes that the event happened as a result of informants who were \"people, sons of Belial from our midst.\" See the summary in Heller, Printing of the Talmud, 156-63. 49.\"</ref>\n\n==English literature==\n*[[John Milton]], ''[[Paradise Lost]]'', Book I\n\n<blockquote><poem>\nBELIAL came last, than whom a Spirit more lewd\nFell not from Heaven, or more gross to love\nVice for it self: To him no Temple stood\nOr Altar smoak'd; yet who more oft then hee\nIn Temples and at Altars, when the Priest\nTurns Atheist, as did ELY'S Sons, who fill'd\nWith lust and violence the house of God.\nIn Courts and Palaces he also Reigns\nAnd in luxurious Cities, where the noyse\nOf riot ascends above thir loftiest Towrs,\nAnd injury and outrage: And when Night\nDarkens the Streets, then wander forth the Sons\nOf BELIAL, flown with insolence and wine.\nWitness the Streets of SODOM, and that night\nIn GIBEAH, when hospitable Dores\nYielded thir Matrons to prevent worse rape.\n</poem></blockquote>\n\n*John Milton, ''Paradise Lost'', Book 2\n<blockquote><poem>\n...

In ''The Satanic Bible'' (''The Book of Belial''), Belial means \"without a master\", and symbolizes independence, self-sufficiency, and personal accomplishment.\n\nIn 1937, [[Edgar Cayce]] used the term \"sons of belial\" and \"sons of the law of one\" for the first time in one of his deep trance readings given between 1923 and 1945. Cayce was often referred to as the \"sleeping prophet\" who gave over 2,500 readings to individuals while in a deep trance state.  While his definition of the sons of belial was consistent with the Hebrew meaning of \"worthless\" individuals focused on self-gratification, Cayce went on to use the term frequently to compare opposing human forces at work in pre-historical times related to the early development of [[Atlantis]].\n\n==Popular culture==\n{{main|Belial in popular culture}}\nPopular culture in the [[20th Century]] included many references to Belial; notably in the celebrated silent film ''[[Nosferatu]]'' (1922), [[Aldous Huxley]]'s novel ''[[Ape and Essence]]'' (1948), [[Philip K. Dick]]'s novel ''[[The Divine Invasion]]'' (1981), the cult horror film ''[[Basket Case (film)|Basket Case]]'' (1982), [[Dean Koontz]]'s novel ''[[Phantoms (novel)|Phantoms]]'' (1983), and [[Graham Masterton]]'s novel ''Master of Lies'' (1991). Belial has also a experienced a resurgence in popularity during the 21st Century in numerous mediums, with video games being the most prominent.\n\n* In the 2005 horror film, ''[[The Exorcism of Emily Rose]]'', Belial is featured as the Devil's representative who possesses the title character and kills the priest that eventually banishes him.\n\n* In the real time strategy game ''Dungeon Keeper'''s Deeper Dungeons expansion the final level is titled \u201cBelial\u201d.\n \n* In the role playing game ''[[Vampire: the Requiem]]'', Belial's Brood is a covenant of vampires that serve Vice and evil forces, consorting with infernal spirits for power.\n\n* [[Blizzard Entertainment]]'s video game ''[[Diablo 3]]'' has Belial function as the final boss of Act 2 in it's storyline. In the City of Caldeum, where Belial takes residence, there are definite Arabic tones for the art direction and setting in the aforementioned chapter. Also known as the \"Lord of Lies\" and the \"Master of Deception\", Belial is regarded as one of the four Lesser Evils in the mortal realm that seek to make this world an outpost of Hell itself.. \n\n* [[Westwood Studios]]'s PC game ''[[Lands of Lore: Guardians of Destiny]]'' features Belial as its main antagonist, portraying him as an evil god with a devil-like appearance.\n\n* In the ''[[Warhammer 40k]]'' universe Belial is the current Grand Master of the Deathwing of the Dark Angels Space Marine Chapter which has other characters named after bleaker Abrahamic entities, such as Samael, the poison of God, and Azrael, the Angel of Death.\n\n* In the mobile game ''Puzzle and Dragons'', Belial is a monster that is part of the Archdemon series.\n\n* In the book ''The Little Ships'' by [[J.A. Sutherland]], the main character sails in a spaceship named Belial.\n\n* \"Belial's Meat\" is a health item in the video game ''[[Off (video game)|Off]]'' by Unproductive Fun Time.\n\n* In the video game ''[[Binding of isaac (game)|Binding of Isaac]]'', the Book of Belial is an activated item.\n\n* In the mobile game ''[[Crash Fever]]'', Belial is one of the first protagonists.\n\n* In ''[[Granblue Fantasy]]'', Belial is a \"fallen angel\", appearing in the What Makes The Sky Blue 2 and 3 event(s) as one of the main antagonists.\n\n* \"Belial\" is the theme held in meditation by Vaughn Benjamin (Akae Beka) on the Midnite & Ras L Collaborative album ''Thru & True'' (2006).\n\n* Belial is referenced, among other demons, on [[Mayhem (band)|Mayhem]]'s 2014 studio album ''[[Esoteric Warfare]]''. Belial is mentioned in \"Pandaemon,\" the fourth track on the LP.\n\n* In Cassandra Clare's bestselling [[Shadowhunter Chronicles]], Belial is one of the [[Prince of Hell]] as well as the demonic father of a major character, Theresa Gray, who was the protagonist of [[The Infernal Devices]]. In ''[[Shadowhunters]]'', the television adaptation of the novel series, Belial is the demonic father of a supporting character in season 3, the warlock Lorenzo Rey. Belial is mentioned as Lorenzo's father in the episode \"City of Glass\".\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of theological demons]]\n* [[Asmodai]]\n* [[Bel (mythology)|Bel]]\n* [[Demon]]\n* [[Devil]]\n* [[Samael]]\n* [[Satan]]\n* [[Serpent (Bible)|Serpent]]\n* [[Sin]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n*S.
