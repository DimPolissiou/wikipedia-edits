He has never had a job and does not care for responsibility. Han-gyul is hung up on his first love, Han Yoo-joo ([[Chae Jung-an]]), who only sees him as a friend. Go Eun-chan ([[Yoon Eun-hye]]) is a 24-year-old [[tomboy]] who is often mistaken for a guy. Her father died when she was 16 years old and since then she has taken over as the breadwinner in her family. When Han-kyul and Eun-chan meet, he, not knowing that she is a girl, decides to hire her to pretend to be his gay lover so that he can escape the blind dates arranged by his grandmother.\n\nAfter getting an ultimatum from his grandmother, Han-gyul takes over a rundown old coffee shop, later renamed \"Coffee Prince,\" to prove that he's capable, both to his grandmother and to Yoo-joo. In order to attract female customers, he only hires good-looking male employees. Eun-chan, desperate for money, continues to hide her gender to get a job at Coffee Prince.\n\nSoon, feelings start to develop between Eun-chan and Han-kyul. As Han-gyul is unaware that Eun-chan is a woman, he starts to question his sexuality and is thrown into turmoil. When Han-gyul finds out that Eun-chan is a woman, he gets angry.

Her father died when she was 16 years old and since then she has taken over as the breadwinner in her family. When Han-kyul and Eun-chan meet, he, not knowing that she is a girl, decides to hire her to pretend to be his gay lover so that he can escape the blind dates arranged by his grandmother.\n\nAfter getting an ultimatum from his grandmother, Han-gyul takes over a rundown old coffee shop, later renamed \"Coffee Prince,\" to prove that he's capable, both to his grandmother and to Yoo-joo. In order to attract female customers, he only hires good-looking male employees. Eun-chan, desperate for money, continues to hide her gender to get a job at Coffee Prince.\n\nSoon, feelings start to develop between Eun-chan and Han-kyul. As Han-gyul is unaware that Eun-chan is a woman, he starts to question his sexuality and is thrown into turmoil. When Han-gyul finds out that Eun-chan is a woman, he gets angry.

Battle royale games involve dozens to hundreds of players, who start with minimal equipment and then must eliminate all other opponents while avoiding being trapped outside of a shrinking \"safe area\", with the winner being the last player or team alive. The name for the genre is taken from the 2000 Japanese film ''[[Battle Royale (film)|Battle Royale]]'', itself based on the [[Battle Royale (novel)|novel of the same name]], which presents a [[Battle royale genre|similar theme]] of a last-man-standing competition in a shrinking play zone.\n\nThe genre's origins arose from [[mod (video gaming)|mods]] for large-scale online survival games like ''[[Minecraft]]'' and ''[[ARMA 2]]'' in the early 2010s. By the end of the decade, the genre became a cultural phenomenon, with standalone games such as ''[[PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds]]'' (2017), ''[[Fortnite Battle Royale]]'' (2017), ''[[Apex Legends]]'' (2019), and ''[[Call of Duty: Warzone]]'' (2020), each having received tens of millions of players within months of their releases.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theloadout.com/pubg/sales|title=PUBG has sold 60 million copies since launch|website=The Loadout|language=en-GB|access-date=2020-04-21}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.gamesradar.com/how-many-people-play-fortnite/|title=How many people play Fortnite?

In each match, the goal is to be the [[Last man standing (gaming)|last player or team standing]] by eliminating all other opponents. A match starts by placing the player-characters into a large map space, typically by having all players skydive from a large aircraft within a brief time limit. The map may have random distribution or allow players to have some control of where they start. All players start with minimal equipment, giving no player an implicit advantage at the onset. Equipment, usually used for combat, survival or transport is randomly scattered around the map, often at landmarks on the map, such as within buildings in [[ghost town]]s. Players need to search the map for these items while avoid being killed by other players, who cannot be visually marked or distinguishable either on-screen or on the map, requiring the player to solely use their own eyes and ears to deduce their positions. Equipment from eliminated players can usually be looted as well. These games often include some mechanic to push opponents closer together as the game progresses, usually taking the form of a gradually shrinking safe zone, with players outside of the zone eventually being killed.\n\nTypically, battle royale contestants are only given one [[Life (gaming)|life]] to play; any players who die are not allowed to [[respawn]]. Games with team support may allow players to enter a temporary, near-death state once health is depleted, giving allies the opportunity to [[glossary of video game terms#revive|revive]] them before they give out or are finished off by an opponent. The match is over when only one player or team remains, and the game typically provides some type of reward, such as in-game currency used for cosmetic items, to all players based on how long they survived. The random nature of starting point, item placement, and safe area reduction enables the battle royale genre to challenge players to think and react quickly and improve strategies throughout the match as to be the last man/team standing. In addition to standalone games, the battle royale concept may also be present as part of one of many game modes within a larger game, or may be applied as a user-created [[mod (video gaming)|mod]] created for another game.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.pcgamer.com/the-best-battle-royale-games-modes-and-mods/ | title = The best battle royale games, modes and mods | first = Fraser | last = Brown | date = September 15, 2017 | accessdate = September 15, 2017 | work = [[PC Gamer]] | url-status = live | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20170915204216/http://www.pcgamer.com/the-best-battle-royale-games-modes-and-mods/ | archivedate = September 15, 2017 | df = mdy-all }}</ref>\n\nThere are various modifications that can be implemented atop the fundamentals of the battle royale.

Battle royale games involve dozens to hundreds of players, who start with minimal equipment and then must eliminate all other opponents while avoiding being trapped outside of a shrinking \"safe area\", with the winner being the last player or team alive. The name for the genre is taken from the 2000 Japanese film ''[[Battle Royale (film)|Battle Royale]]'', itself based on the [[Battle Royale (novel)|novel of the same name]], which presents a [[Battle royale genre|similar theme]] of a last-man-standing competition in a shrinking play zone.\n\nThe genre's origins arose from [[mod (video gaming)|mods]] for large-scale online survival games like ''[[Minecraft]]'' and ''[[ARMA 2]]'' in the early 2010s. By the end of the decade, the genre became a cultural phenomenon, with standalone games such as ''[[PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds]]'' (2017), ''[[Fortnite Battle Royale]]'' (2017), ''[[Apex Legends]]'' (2019), and ''[[Call of Duty: Warzone]]'' (2020), each having received tens of millions of players within months of their releases.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theloadout.com/pubg/sales|title=PUBG has sold 60 million copies since launch|website=The Loadout|language=en-GB|access-date=2020-04-21}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.gamesradar.com/how-many-people-play-fortnite/|title=How many people play Fortnite?

In each match, the goal is to be the [[Last man standing (gaming)|last player or team standing]] by eliminating all other opponents. A match starts by placing the player-characters into a large map space, typically by having all players skydive from a large aircraft within a brief time limit. The map may have random distribution or allow players to have some control of where they start. All players start with minimal equipment, giving no player an implicit advantage at the onset. Equipment, usually used for combat, survival or transport is randomly scattered around the map, often at landmarks on the map, such as within buildings in [[ghost town]]s. Players need to search the map for these items while avoid being killed by other players, who cannot be visually marked or distinguishable either on-screen or on the map, requiring the player to solely use their own eyes and ears to deduce their positions. Equipment from eliminated players can usually be looted as well. These games often include some mechanic to push opponents closer together as the game progresses, usually taking the form of a gradually shrinking safe zone, with players outside of the zone eventually being killed.\n\nTypically, battle royale contestants are only given one [[Life (gaming)|life]] to play; any players who die are not allowed to [[respawn]]. Games with team support may allow players to enter a temporary, near-death state once health is depleted, giving allies the opportunity to [[glossary of video game terms#revive|revive]] them before they give out or are finished off by an opponent. The match is over when only one player or team remains, and the game typically provides some type of reward, such as in-game currency used for cosmetic items, to all players based on how long they survived. The random nature of starting point, item placement, and safe area reduction enables the battle royale genre to challenge players to think and react quickly and improve strategies throughout the match as to be the last man/team standing. In addition to standalone games, the battle royale concept may also be present as part of one of many game modes within a larger game, or may be applied as a user-created [[mod (video gaming)|mod]] created for another game.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.pcgamer.com/the-best-battle-royale-games-modes-and-mods/ | title = The best battle royale games, modes and mods | first = Fraser | last = Brown | date = September 15, 2017 | accessdate = September 15, 2017 | work = [[PC Gamer]] | url-status = live | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20170915204216/http://www.pcgamer.com/the-best-battle-royale-games-modes-and-mods/ | archivedate = September 15, 2017 | df = mdy-all }}</ref>\n\nThere are various modifications that can be implemented atop the fundamentals of the battle royale. For example, ''[[Fortnite]]'' introduced a temporary mode in an event which is 50-versus-50 player mode in its ''[[Fortnite Battle Royale]]'' free-to-play game; players are assigned one of the two teams, and work with their teammates to collect resources and weapons towards constructing fortifications as the safe area of the game shrinks down, with the goal to eliminate all the players on the other team.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.polygon.com/2017/12/7/16748276/fortnite-battle-royale-50-vs-50-trailer-date-tga-2017 | title = Fortnite: Battle Royale gets a new 50-versus-50 team mode | first = Charlie | last = Hall | date = December 7, 2017 | accessdate = December 12, 2017 | work = [[Polygon (website)|Polygon]] | url-status = live | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20171213010918/https://www.polygon.com/2017/12/7/16748276/fortnite-battle-royale-50-vs-50-trailer-date-tga-2017 | archivedate = December 13, 2017| df = mdy-all }}</ref>\n\n==History==\n===Early games (2012\u20132016)===\nFormulative elements of the battle royale genre had existed prior the 2010s.
