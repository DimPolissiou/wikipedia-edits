Earlier that day, Parliament had been discussing the issue of a member of parliament (MP) who allegedly asked the [[Melaka]] Customs and Excise Department to \"close one eye\" to an illegal import shipment of timber. [[Lim Kit Siang]] of the [[Democratic Action Party (Malaysia)|Democratic Action Party]] (DAP) and the [[Opposition (parliamentary)|Leader of the Opposition]] moved a motion to refer the MP in question to the ''[[Dewan Rakyat]]'' House Committee of Rights and Privileges. Several BN MPs quickly voiced their disagreement with the motion, but Shahrir \u2013 according to one source \u2013 \"shocked the House\" when he stood and spoke in favour of the motion in order \"to maintain the integrity of parliamentarians and Parliament\". The motion was eventually rejected \u2013 in line with the BN policy of not supporting motions moved by the opposition<ref>Chok, Suat Ling (4 October 2005). \"MPs in the dock\". ''[[New Straits Times]]'', p. 1, 6.</ref> \u2013 by the House. Shahrir walked out of the House and held a press conference in the Parliament lobby, telling reporters that \"Even though it was an Opposition motion, we should support it for its importance to MPs and the House.\" He then announced his resignation as the Chairman of the BNBBC. The Deputy chairman, [[Raja Ahmad Zainuddin Raja Omar]], later told reporters he would attempt to persuade Shahrir to stay on.<ref>Yusop, Husna (4 May 2006). [http://www.malaysia-today.net/Blog-e/2006/05/shahrir-quits-as-bbc-chief-after-mps.htm \"Shahrir quits as BBC chief after MPs failed to support an 'integrity' motion\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060519061014/http://www.malaysia-today.net/Blog-e/2006/05/shahrir-quits-as-bbc-chief-after-mps.htm |date=19 May 2006 }}. ''[[Malaysia Today]]''.</ref>\n\nAfter an emergency meeting, the BNBBC also announced they would ask Shahrir to stay on. In the meantime, the MP for [[Jasin, Malacca|Jasin]], [[Mohammad Said Yusof]], said he was the MP implicated in the matter. However, he insisted he had only asked for leniency on the grounds that the timber had been found to be illegal due to a technicality. Minister in the Prime Minister's Department in charge of Parliamentary Affairs, [[Nazri Aziz|Datuk Seri Mohamed Nazri Aziz]], said that \"It is not that we disagree with Shahrir but it's an opposition motion and we usually reject their motions.\" He also told the press that the House Rights and Privileges Committee could not have an unnamed MP referred to it on the basis of a newspaper report. Nazri said that the Customs chief would have to complain to the [[Speaker of the Dewan Rakyat|Speaker]] and name the MP in question.<ref>\"Shahrir quits as Backbenchers Club chief\", pp. 1, 3.

''The Star''.</ref>\n\nLater that week, Shahrir met with then [[Deputy Prime Minister of Malaysia|Deputy Prime Minister]] and BN [[Chief Whip (Malaysia)|Chief Whip]], [[Najib Tun Razak|Dato' Sri Najib Tun Razak]] to officially submit his resignation. While Najib accepted it, it was not immediately clear if he would initiate disciplinary action against Shahrir for breaking ranks with the party. Shahrir initially insisted that \"This is not a party matter,\" but later told the press that he resigned \"as I had breached the party's directive against supporting an Opposition motion.\"<ref>\"Disciplinary action against Shahrir?\", p. 7. (6 May 2006). ''[[New Straits Times]]''.</ref>\n\nLater, several backbenchers demanded that Shahrir's resignation be rescinded. The BNBBC secretary, [[Rosli Mat Hassan]] (MP for [[Dungun]]) issued a statement on the behalf of other backbenchers where he declared, \"the unwritten rule that presently [makes] it mandatory for BN MPs to oppose any opposition motion regardless of merit [runs] counter to basic parliamentary practice and [infringes] on the duties of MPs\". It was reported that [[Zaid Ibrahim]], MP for [[Kota Bharu]], was now leading a campaign to re-elect Shahrir as the BNBBC chairman. Shahrir's supporters said that it was their right to decide who led them, and implied that this was not Najib's prerogative.<ref>Beh, Lih Yi (8 May 2006).

A spokesperson also said that \"The current procedure now is MPs must give a written notice to the Speaker, and only when the Speaker is satisfied, can the House decide whether the matter should be referred to the committee. ...

Zaid and most of the other backbenchers who had backed further autonomy told the press they accepted the decision. However, Rosli clashed with Minister in the Prime Minister's Department in charge of Parliamentary Affairs and Deputy Chief Whip [[Nazri Aziz]], who said that \"The Whip is only relaxed when it is lifted by the chief or the deputy chief Whip.\" Rosli said \"...in the absence of his [the Chief Whip's] direction, the general rule is to that MPs are to vote according to their conscience...\" Although many backbenchers said they considered Shahrir the BNBBC chairman, Abdullah said that the government had planned to sack Shahrir, \"But before we could do that he resigned, and we respect his decision.\"<ref>Megan, M.K. & Andres, Leslie (9 May 2006). \"Abdullah: Vote along party lines\", p. 4.

Earlier that day, Parliament had been discussing the issue of a member of parliament (MP) who allegedly asked the [[Melaka]] Customs and Excise Department to \"close one eye\" to an illegal import shipment of timber. [[Lim Kit Siang]] of the [[Democratic Action Party (Malaysia)|Democratic Action Party]] (DAP) and the [[Opposition (parliamentary)|Leader of the Opposition]] moved a motion to refer the MP in question to the ''[[Dewan Rakyat]]'' House Committee of Rights and Privileges. Several BN MPs quickly voiced their disagreement with the motion, but Shahrir \u2013 according to one source \u2013 \"shocked the House\" when he stood and spoke in favour of the motion in order \"to maintain the integrity of parliamentarians and Parliament\". The motion was eventually rejected \u2013 in line with the BN policy of not supporting motions moved by the opposition<ref>Chok, Suat Ling (4 October 2005). \"MPs in the dock\". ''[[New Straits Times]]'', p. 1, 6.</ref> \u2013 by the House. Shahrir walked out of the House and held a press conference in the Parliament lobby, telling reporters that \"Even though it was an Opposition motion, we should support it for its importance to MPs and the House.\" He then announced his resignation as the Chairman of the BNBBC. The Deputy chairman, [[Raja Ahmad Zainuddin Raja Omar]], later told reporters he would attempt to persuade Shahrir to stay on.<ref>Yusop, Husna (4 May 2006). [http://www.malaysia-today.net/Blog-e/2006/05/shahrir-quits-as-bbc-chief-after-mps.htm \"Shahrir quits as BBC chief after MPs failed to support an 'integrity' motion\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060519061014/http://www.malaysia-today.net/Blog-e/2006/05/shahrir-quits-as-bbc-chief-after-mps.htm |date=19 May 2006 }}. ''[[Malaysia Today]]''.</ref>\n\nAfter an emergency meeting, the BNBBC also announced they would ask Shahrir to stay on. In the meantime, the MP for [[Jasin, Malacca|Jasin]], [[Mohammad Said Yusof]], said he was the MP implicated in the matter. However, he insisted he had only asked for leniency on the grounds that the timber had been found to be illegal due to a technicality. Minister in the Prime Minister's Department in charge of Parliamentary Affairs, [[Nazri Aziz|Datuk Seri Mohamed Nazri Aziz]], said that \"It is not that we disagree with Shahrir but it's an opposition motion and we usually reject their motions.\" He also told the press that the House Rights and Privileges Committee could not have an unnamed MP referred to it on the basis of a newspaper report. Nazri said that the Customs chief would have to complain to the [[Speaker of the Dewan Rakyat|Speaker]] and name the MP in question.<ref>\"Shahrir quits as Backbenchers Club chief\", pp. 1, 3. (5 May 2006). ''[[The Star (Malaysia)|The Star]]''.</ref><ref>\"'I asked dept to be lenient'\", p. 3. (5 May 2006). ''The Star''.</ref>\n\nLater that week, Shahrir met with then [[Deputy Prime Minister of Malaysia|Deputy Prime Minister]] and BN [[Chief Whip (Malaysia)|Chief Whip]], [[Najib Tun Razak|Dato' Sri Najib Tun Razak]] to officially submit his resignation. While Najib accepted it, it was not immediately clear if he would initiate disciplinary action against Shahrir for breaking ranks with the party. Shahrir initially insisted that \"This is not a party matter,\" but later told the press that he resigned \"as I had breached the party's directive against supporting an Opposition motion.\"<ref>\"Disciplinary action against Shahrir?\", p. 7. (6 May 2006). ''[[New Straits Times]]''.</ref>\n\nLater, several backbenchers demanded that Shahrir's resignation be rescinded. The BNBBC secretary, [[Rosli Mat Hassan]] (MP for [[Dungun]]) issued a statement on the behalf of other backbenchers where he declared, \"the unwritten rule that presently [makes] it mandatory for BN MPs to oppose any opposition motion regardless of merit [runs] counter to basic parliamentary practice and [infringes] on the duties of MPs\". It was reported that [[Zaid Ibrahim]], MP for [[Kota Bharu]], was now leading a campaign to re-elect Shahrir as the BNBBC chairman. Shahrir's supporters said that it was their right to decide who led them, and implied that this was not Najib's prerogative.<ref>Beh, Lih Yi (8 May 2006).

A spokesperson also said that \"The current procedure now is MPs must give a written notice to the Speaker, and only when the Speaker is satisfied, can the House decide whether the matter should be referred to the committee. ...

Zaid and most of the other backbenchers who had backed further autonomy told the press they accepted the decision. However, Rosli clashed with Minister in the Prime Minister's Department in charge of Parliamentary Affairs and Deputy Chief Whip [[Nazri Aziz]], who said that \"The Whip is only relaxed when it is lifted by the chief or the deputy chief Whip.\" Rosli said \"...in the absence of his [the Chief Whip's] direction, the general rule is to that MPs are to vote according to their conscience...\" Although many backbenchers said they considered Shahrir the BNBBC chairman, Abdullah said that the government had planned to sack Shahrir, \"But before we could do that he resigned, and we respect his decision.\"<ref>Megan, M.K. & Andres, Leslie (9 May 2006). \"Abdullah: Vote along party lines\", p. 4.

Elections follow a [[two-round system]]. The first round of the election is called the [[primary election]]. The candidate receiving a majority of the vote in the primary is elected outright. If no candidate receives a majority, the top two candidates advance to a runoff election, called the [[general election]]. The City Charter allows for [[write-in candidate]]s for the primary election, but not for the runoff in the general election.

If the petition is successful, a special election is held asking whether the incumbent should be removed and who among a list of candidates should replace the incumbent. If the recall is successful, the replacement candidate with the majority of votes succeeds the ousted incumbent.

Six individuals served non-consecutive terms, the first of which began in 1854 and the last of which ended in 1921. Those who served non-consecutive terms are only counted once in the official count of mayoralties. [[Stephen Clark Foster]] was also appointed as Mayor of Los Angeles in 1848 prior to California statehood and official incorporation of the city.{{citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\nThe longest term was that of [[Tom Bradley (American politician)|Tom Bradley]], who served for 20 years over five terms prior to the establishment of successive term limits. The shortest term, not counting city council presidents serving as acting mayor, was that of [[William Stephens]], who was appointed to serve for less than two weeks after [[Arthur Cyprian Harper]] resigned from office. Two mayors died in office: [[Henry Mellus]] and [[Frederick A. MacDougall]]. Three Hispanics have served as mayor since incorporation: [[Antonio F. Coronel]], [[Crist\u00f3bal Aguilar|Cristobal Aguilar]], and [[Antonio Villaraigosa]]. Many other Hispanics served as mayor prior to California joining the United States including [[Manuel Requena]], who also briefly served as acting mayor post-statehood in his role as city council president. Tom Bradley is the only African American to have served as mayor, but was the city's longest-serving mayor.  Two French Canadians have served as mayor, including [[Damien Marchesseault]], who served for three distinct periods, and [[Prudent Beaudry]].\n\nThis list includes three Presidents of the City Council who served as Acting Mayor due to a vacancy in the office of the mayor but who were not officially appointed as mayor.

The mayor is given the authority to appoint general managers and commissioners, remove officials from city posts, and is required to propose a budget each year.

Elections follow a [[two-round system]]. The first round of the election is called the [[primary election]]. The candidate receiving a majority of the vote in the primary is elected outright. If no candidate receives a majority, the top two candidates advance to a runoff election, called the [[general election]]. The City Charter allows for [[write-in candidate]]s for the primary election, but not for the runoff in the general election.

Those who served non-consecutive terms are only counted once in the official count of mayoralties. [[Stephen Clark Foster]] was also appointed as Mayor of Los Angeles in 1848 prior to California statehood and official incorporation of the city.{{citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\nThe longest term was that of [[Tom Bradley (American politician)|Tom Bradley]], who served for 20 years over five terms prior to the establishment of successive term limits. The shortest term, not counting city council presidents serving as acting mayor, was that of [[William Stephens]], who was appointed to serve for less than two weeks after [[Arthur Cyprian Harper]] resigned from office. Two mayors died in office: [[Henry Mellus]] and [[Frederick A. MacDougall]]. Three Hispanics have served as mayor since incorporation: [[Antonio F. Coronel]], [[Crist\u00f3bal Aguilar|Cristobal Aguilar]], and [[Antonio Villaraigosa]]. Many other Hispanics served as mayor prior to California joining the United States including [[Manuel Requena]], who also briefly served as acting mayor post-statehood in his role as city council president. Tom Bradley is the only African American to have served as mayor, but was the city's longest-serving mayor.  Two French Canadians have served as mayor, including [[Damien Marchesseault]], who served for three distinct periods, and [[Prudent Beaudry]].\n\nThis list includes three Presidents of the City Council who served as Acting Mayor due to a vacancy in the office of the mayor but who were not officially appointed as mayor.
