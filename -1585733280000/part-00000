The operation commenced after large numbers of [[Belgian Armed Forces|Belgian]], [[British Army|British]], and [[French Army|French]] troops were cut off and surrounded by [[German Army (1935\u20131945)|German troops]] during the six-week [[Battle of France]]. In a speech to the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]], British Prime Minister [[Winston Churchill]] called this \"a colossal military disaster\", saying \"the whole root and core and brain of the British Army\" had been stranded at Dunkirk and seemed about to perish or be captured.{{sfn|Churchill|2003|p=212}} In his \"[[we shall fight on the beaches]]\" speech on 4 June, he hailed their rescue as a \"miracle of deliverance\".{{sfn|Safire|2004|p=146}}\n\nAfter [[Nazi Germany]] [[Invasion of Poland|invaded Poland]] in September 1939, France and the [[British Empire]] declared war on Germany and imposed an [[Blockade of Germany (1939-45)|economic blockade]]. The [[British Expeditionary Force (World War II)|British Expeditionary Force]] (BEF) was sent to help defend France. After the [[Phoney War]] of October 1939 to April 1940, Germany [[Battle of Belgium|invaded Belgium]], the [[Battle of the Netherlands|Netherlands]], and [[Battle of France|France]] on 10 May 1940. Three [[panzer corps]] attacked through the [[Ardennes]] and drove northwest to the [[English Channel]]. By 21 May, German forces had trapped the BEF, the remains of the Belgian forces, and three French [[field army|field armies]] along the northern coast of France. BEF commander [[General (British Army)|General]] [[John Vereker, 6th Viscount Gort|Viscount Gort]] immediately saw evacuation across the Channel as the best course of action, and began planning a withdrawal to Dunkirk, the closest good port.\n\nLate on 23 May, a halt order was issued by ''[[Generaloberst]]'' [[Gerd von Rundstedt]], commander of [[Army Group A]]. [[Adolf Hitler]] approved this order the next day, and had the [[Oberkommando der Wehrmacht|German High Command]] send confirmation to the front. Destroying the trapped BEF, French, and Belgian armies was left to the ''[[Luftwaffe]]'' until the order was rescinded on 26 May. This gave Allied forces time to construct defensive works and pull back large numbers of troops to fight the [[Battle of Dunkirk]]. From 28 to 31 May, in the [[Siege of Lille (1940)|Siege of Lille]], the remaining 40,000 men of the once-formidable French First Army fought a delaying action against seven German [[Division (military)|divisions]], including three [[Panzer division|armoured divisions]].\n\nOn the first day only 7,669 Allied soldiers were evacuated, but by the end of the eighth day, 338,226 had been rescued by a hastily assembled fleet of over 800 vessels. Many troops were able to embark from the harbour's protective [[mole (architecture)|mole]] onto 39 British [[Royal Navy]] [[destroyer]]s, 4 [[Royal Canadian Navy]] destroyers,{{sfn|McIntyre|2017}} at least 3 [[French Navy]] destroyers, and a variety of civilian merchant ships. Others had to wade out from the beaches, waiting for hours in shoulder-deep water. Some were ferried to the larger ships by what became known as the [[Little Ships of Dunkirk]], a [[flotilla]] of hundreds of [[merchant marine]] boats, [[fishing boat]]s, [[pleasure craft]], [[yacht]]s, and [[Lifeboat (rescue)|lifeboats]] called into service from Britain. The BEF lost 68,000 soldiers during the French campaign and had to abandon nearly all of its tanks, vehicles, and equipment. In his 4 June speech, Churchill also reminded the country that \"we must be very careful not to assign to this deliverance the attributes of a victory. Wars are not won by evacuations.\"{{sfn|Churchill|1949|p=115}}\n\n==Background==\n{{Further|Battle of France}}\nIn September 1939, after [[Nazi Germany]] [[invasion of Poland|invaded Poland]], the United Kingdom sent the [[British Expeditionary Force (World War II)|British Expeditionary Force]] (BEF) to aid in the defence of France, landing at [[Cherbourg]], [[Nantes]], and [[Saint-Nazaire]]. By May 1940 the force consisted of ten [[Division (military)|divisions]] in three [[corps]] under the command of General [[John Vereker, 6th Viscount Gort]].{{sfn|Thompson|2011|p=9}}{{sfn|Thompson|2011|p=7}} Working with the BEF were the [[Belgian Armed Forces|Belgian Army]] and the French [[First Army (France)|First]], [[Seventh Army (France)|Seventh]], and [[Ninth Army (France)|Ninth]] Armies.{{sfn|Thompson|2011|p=305}}\n\nDuring the 1930s, the French had constructed the [[Maginot Line]], a series of fortifications along their border with Germany. This line had been designed to deter a German invasion across the Franco-German border and funnel an attack into Belgium, which could then be met by the best divisions of the [[French Army]]. Thus, any future war would take place outside of French territory, [[Zone rouge|avoiding a repeat]] of the [[First World War]].{{sfn|Jackson|2003|p=33}}{{sfn|Roth|2010|p=6}} The area immediately to the north of the Maginot Line was covered by the heavily wooded [[Ardennes]] region,{{sfn|Kaufmann|Kaufmann|2007|p=23}} which French General [[Philippe P\u00e9tain]] declared to be \"impenetrable\" as long as \"special provisions\" were taken. He believed that any enemy force emerging from the forest would be vulnerable to a [[Pincer movement|pincer attack]] and destroyed. The French commander-in-chief, [[Maurice Gamelin]], also believed the area to be of a limited threat, noting that it \"never favoured large operations\".{{sfn|Jackson|2003|p=32}} With this in mind, the area was left lightly defended.{{sfn|Jackson|2003|p=33}}\n\nThe initial plan for the German [[battle of France|invasion of France]] called for an encirclement attack through the Netherlands and Belgium, avoiding the Maginot Line.{{sfn|Melvin|2010|p=140}} [[Erich von Manstein]], then Chief of Staff of the German [[Army Group A]], prepared the outline of a different plan and submitted it to the [[OKH]] (German High Command) via his superior, ''[[Generaloberst]]'' [[Gerd von Rundstedt]].{{sfn|Lemay|2010|pp=98\u2013102}}{{sfn|Forczyk|2010|pp=11\u201314}} Manstein's plan suggested that panzer divisions should attack through the Ardennes, then establish [[bridgehead]]s on the [[Meuse River]] and rapidly drive to the English Channel. The Germans would thus cut off the [[Allies of World War II|Allied armies]] in Belgium. This part of the plan later became known as the ''Sichelschnitt'' (\"sickle cut\").{{sfn|Forczyk|2010|pp=11\u201314}}{{sfn|Melvin|2010|p=145}} [[Adolf Hitler]] approved a modified version of Manstein's ideas, today known as the [[Manstein Plan]], after meeting with him on 17 February.{{sfn|Melvin|2010|p=132}}\n\n[[File:16May-21May Battle of Belgium.PNG|thumb|Situation on 21 May 1940; German forces occupy the area shaded in pink]]\n\nOn 10 May, Germany [[Battle of Belgium|invaded Belgium]] and [[Battle of the Netherlands|the Netherlands]].{{sfn|Shirer|1960|p=713}} [[Army Group B]], under ''Generaloberst'' [[Fedor von Bock]], attacked into Belgium, while the three panzer corps of Army Group A under Rundstedt swung around to the south and drove for the Channel.{{sfn|Thompson|2011|p=37}} The BEF advanced from the Belgian border to positions along the [[River Dyle]] within Belgium, where they fought elements of Army Group B starting on 10 May.{{sfn|Thompson|2011|p=26}}{{sfn|Churchill|1949|loc=Map, p. 33}} They were ordered to begin a fighting withdrawal to the [[Scheldt River]] on 14 May when the Belgian and French positions on their flanks failed to hold.{{sfn|Atkin|1990|pp=74\u201375}} During a visit to Paris on 17 May, Prime Minister Winston Churchill was astonished to learn from Gamelin that the French had committed all their troops to the ongoing engagements and had no strategic reserves.{{sfn|Churchill|1949|p=47}} On 19 May, Gort met with French General [[Gaston Billotte]], commander of the French First Army and overall coordinator of the Allied forces. Billotte revealed that the French had no troops between the Germans and the sea. Gort immediately saw that evacuation across the Channel was the best course of action, and began planning a withdrawal to Dunkirk, the closest location with good port facilities.{{sfn|Thompson|2011|pp=64\u201365}} Surrounded by marshes, Dunkirk boasted old fortifications and the longest sand beach in Europe, where large groups could assemble.{{sfn|Atkin|1990|p=123}} On 20 May, on Churchill's suggestion, the Admiralty began arranging for all available small vessels to be made ready to proceed to France.{{sfn|Churchill|1949|pp=58\u201359}} After continued engagements and a failed Allied attempt on 21 May at [[Battle of Arras (1940)|Arras]] to cut through the German spearhead,{{sfn|Thompson|2011|p=98}} the BEF was trapped, along with the remains of the Belgian forces and the three French armies, in an area along the coast of northern France and Belgium.{{sfn|Shirer|1960|p=728}}{{sfn|Thompson|2011|loc=Map, p. 61}}\n\n==Prelude==\n[[File:Gort and Blount at Arras WWII IWM O 177.jpg|thumb|[[Lord Gort]] (gesturing, at centre) was commander of the [[British Expeditionary Force (World War II)|British Expeditionary Force]]. ]]\nWithout informing the French, the British began planning on 20 May for Operation Dynamo, the evacuation of the BEF.{{sfn|Atkin|1990|p=123}}{{sfn|Churchill|1949|pp=58\u201359}} This planning was headed by [[Vice Admiral]] [[Bertram Ramsay]] at the naval headquarters below [[Dover Castle]], from which he briefed Churchill as it was under way.{{sfn|Lord|1983|pp=43\u201344}} Ships began gathering at Dover for the evacuation.{{sfn|Churchill|1949|p=100}} On 20 May, the BEF sent Brigadier Gerald Whitfield to Dunkirk to start evacuating unnecessary personnel. Overwhelmed by what he later described as \"a somewhat alarming movement towards Dunkirk by both officers and men\", due to a shortage of food and water, he had to send many along without thoroughly checking their credentials. Even officers ordered to stay behind to aid the evacuation disappeared onto the boats.{{sfn|Atkin|1990|p=124}}\n\nOn 22 May, Churchill ordered the BEF to attack southward in coordination with the French First Army under General [[Georges Maurice Jean Blanchard|Georges Blanchard]] to reconnect with the remainder of the French forces.{{sfn|Churchill|1949|p=65}} This proposed action was dubbed the Weygand Plan after General [[Maxime Weygand]], appointed Supreme Commander after Gamelin's dismissal on 18 May.{{sfn|Churchill|1949|p=57}} On 25 May, Gort had to abandon any hope of achieving this objective and withdrew on his own initiative, along with Blanchard's forces, behind the Lys Canal, part of a canal system that reached the sea at [[Gravelines]].{{sfn|Churchill|1949|p=84}} Sluice gates had already been opened all along the canal to flood the system and create a barrier (the Canal Line) against the German advance.{{sfn|Churchill|1949|pp=78\u201379}}\n\n===Battle of Dunkirk===\n{{Main|Battle of Dunkirk}}\n[[File:Dunkirksoldier1.JPG|left|thumb|Soldiers were [[strafe]]d and bombed by German aircraft while awaiting transport.{{sfn|Shirer|1960|loc=Footnote, p. 736}}]]\nBy 24 May, the Germans had captured the port of [[Boulogne]] and surrounded [[Calais]].{{sfn|Shirer|1960|p=728}} The engineers of the 2nd Panzer Division under ''[[Generalmajor]]'' [[Rudolf Veiel]] built five bridges over the Canal Line and only one British battalion barred the way to Dunkirk.{{sfn|Lemay|2010|p=152}} On 23 May, at the suggestion of [[4th Army (Wehrmacht)|Fourth Army]] commander ''[[Generalfeldmarschall]]'' [[G\u00fcnther von Kluge]], Rundstedt had ordered the panzer units to halt, concerned about the vulnerability of his flanks and the question of supply to his forward troops.{{sfn|Noakes|Pridham|1988|p=167}}{{sfn|Army Group A War Diary}}{{sfn|OKW Jodl Diary}}{{sfn|Lord|1983|pp=28\u201335}} He was also concerned that the marshy ground around Dunkirk would prove unsuitable for tanks and he wished to conserve them for later operations (in some units, tank losses were 30\u201350 per cent).{{sfn|Cooper|1978| pp=230\u201331}}{{sfn|Atkin|1990|p=120}} Hitler was also apprehensive, and on a visit to Army Group A headquarters on 24 May, he endorsed the order.{{sfn|Cooper|1978| pp=230\u201331}}{{sfn|Lord|1983|pp=28\u201335}}\n\nAir Marshal [[Hermann G\u00f6ring]] urged Hitler to let the ''[[Luftwaffe]]'' (aided by Army Group B{{sfn|Lemay|2010|p=150}}) finish off the British, to the consternation of General [[Franz Halder]], who noted in his diary that the ''Luftwaffe'' was dependent upon the weather and aircrews were worn out after two weeks of battle.{{sfn|Noakes|Pridham|1988|pp=167\u201368}} Rundstedt issued another order, which was sent uncoded. It was picked up by the [[Royal Air Force]] (RAF) [[Y service]] intelligence network at 12:42: \"By order of the Fuhrer&nbsp;... attack north-west of Arras is to be limited to the general line Lens\u2013Bethune\u2013Aire\u2013St Omer\u2013Gravelines. The Canal will not be crossed.\"{{sfn|Costello|1991|p=175}}{{sfn|Hinsley|1994|p=31}} Later that day, Hitler issued Directive 13, which called for the ''Luftwaffe'' to defeat the trapped Allied forces and stop their escape.{{sfn|Cooper|1978|p=232}} At 15:30 on 26 May, Hitler ordered the panzer groups to continue their advance, but most units took another 16 hours to attack.{{sfn|Cooper|1978|p=235}} The delay gave the Allies time to prepare defences vital for the evacuation and prevented the Germans from stopping the Allied retreat from Lille.{{sfn|Noakes|Pridham|1988|p=168}}\n\nThe halt order has been the subject of much discussion by historians.{{sfn|Churchill|1949|p=76}}{{sfn|Lemay|2010|p=149}} Guderian considered the failure to order a timely assault on Dunkirk to be one of the major German mistakes on the [[Western Front (World War II)|Western Front]].{{sfn|Guderian|2001|loc=Footnote, p. 117}} Rundstedt called it \"one of the great turning points of the war\",{{sfn|Shirer|1960|p=731}} and Manstein described it as \"one of Hitler's most critical mistakes\".{{sfn|Lemay|2010|p=153}} [[B. H. Liddell Hart]] interviewed many of the generals after the war and put together a picture of Hitler's strategic thinking on the matter.

A special service attended by [[King George VI]] was held in [[Westminster Abbey]] on 26 May, which was declared a national day of prayer.{{sfn|Miller|1997|p=83}}{{sfn|Atkin|1990|p=122}} The [[Cosmo Gordon Lang|Archbishop of Canterbury]] led prayers \"for our soldiers in dire peril in France\". Similar prayers were offered in synagogues and churches throughout the UK that day, confirming to the public their suspicion of the desperate plight of the troops.{{sfn|Gelb|1990|p=82}} Just before 19:00 on 26 May, Churchill ordered Dynamo to begin, by which time 28,000 men had already departed.{{sfn|Atkin|1990|p=123}} Initial plans called for the recovery of 45,000 men from the BEF within two days, at which time German troops were expected to block further evacuation. Only 25,000 men escaped during this period, including 7,669 on the first day.{{sfn|Liddell Hart|1999|p=78}}{{sfn|Thompson|2011|p=306}}\n\n[[File:Wounded British soldiers evacuated from Dunkirk make their way up the gangplank from a destroyer at Dover, 31 May 1940.

An emergency call was put out for additional help, and by 31 May nearly four hundred small craft were voluntarily and enthusiastically taking part in the effort.{{sfn|Churchill|1949|pp=100\u201301}}\n\nThe same day, the ''Luftwaffe'' heavily bombed Dunkirk, both the town and the dock installations. As the water supply was knocked out, the resulting fires could not be extinguished.{{sfn|Atkin|1990|p=149}} An estimated thousand civilians were killed, one-third of the remaining population of the town.{{sfn|Atkin|1990|p=150}} The ''Luftwaffe'' was met by 16 squadrons of the [[Royal Air Force]], who claimed 38 kills on 27 May while losing 14 aircraft.{{sfn|Atkin|1990|p=149}}{{sfn|Thompson|2011|p=228}} Many more RAF fighters sustained damage and were subsequently written off. On the German side, ''[[Kampfgeschwader 2]]'' (KG 2) and [[KG 3]] suffered the heaviest casualties. German losses amounted to 23 [[Dornier Do 17]]s. [[KG 1]] and [[KG 4]] bombed the beach and harbour and [[KG 54]] sank the 8,000-ton steamer ''Aden''. [[Junkers Ju 87]] ''Stuka'' dive bombers sank the troopship ''Cote d' Azur''. The ''Luftwaffe'' engaged with 300 bombers which were protected by 550 fighter sorties and attacked Dunkirk in twelve raids. They dropped 15,000 [[high explosive]] and 30,000 [[Incendiary device|incendiary bombs]], destroying the oil tanks and wrecking the harbour.{{sfn|Jackson|1974|pp=116\u2013117}} [[No. 11 Group RAF]] flew 22 patrols with 287 aircraft this day, in formations of up to 20 aircraft.{{sfn|Jackson|1974|p=117}}\n\nAltogether, over 3,500 sorties were flown in support of Operation Dynamo.{{sfn|Thompson|2011|p=228}} The RAF continued to inflict a heavy toll on the German bombers throughout the week. Soldiers being bombed and [[strafe]]d while awaiting transport were for the most part unaware of the efforts of the RAF to protect them, as most of the dogfights took place far from the beaches. As a result, many British soldiers bitterly accused the airmen of doing nothing to help.{{sfn|Shirer|1960|loc=Footnote, p. 736}}\n\nOn 25 and 26 May, the ''Luftwaffe'' focused their attention on Allied pockets holding out at Calais, [[Lille]], and [[Amiens]], and did not attack Dunkirk.{{sfn|Atkin|1990|p=150}} Calais, held by the BEF, surrendered on 26 May.{{sfn|Atkin|1990|p=119}} Remnants of the French First Army, [[Siege of Lille (1940)|surrounded at Lille]], fought off seven German divisions, several of them armoured, until 31 May, when the remaining 35,000 soldiers were forced to surrender after running out of food and ammunition.{{sfn|Churchill|1949|p=97}}{{sfn|Atkin|1990|p=144}} The Germans accorded the [[honours of war]] to the defenders of Lille in recognition of their bravery.{{sfn|Fermer|2013|p=208}}\n\n===28 May \u2013 4 June===\n[[File:21May-4June1940-Fall Gelb.jpg|thumb|Situation on 4 June 1940; the remaining French rearguard held a sliver of land around Dunkirk]]\nThe Belgian Army surrendered on 28 May,{{sfn|Shirer|1960|p=729}} leaving a large gap to the east of Dunkirk. Several British divisions were rushed in to cover that side.{{sfn|Churchill|1949|p=96}} The ''Luftwaffe'' flew fewer sorties over Dunkirk on 28 May, switching their attention to the Belgian ports, [[Ostend]] and [[Nieuport]]. The weather over Dunkirk was not conducive to dive or low-level bombing. The RAF flew 11 patrols and 321 sorties, claiming 23 destroyed for the loss of 13 aircraft.{{sfn|Jackson|1974|p=117}} On 28 May, 17,804 soldiers arrived at British ports.{{sfn|Thompson|2011|p=306}}\n\nOn 29 May, 47,310 British troops were rescued{{sfn|Thompson|2011|p=306}} as the ''Luftwaffe''{{'}}s Ju 87s exacted a heavy toll on shipping. The British destroyer [[HMS Grenade (H86)|HMS ''Grenade'']] was sunk and the [[French destroyer Mistral|French destroyer ''Mistral'']] was crippled while her sister ships, each laden with 500 men, were damaged by near misses. British destroyers [[HMS Jaguar (F34)|''Jaguar'']] and [[HMS Verity (D63)|''Verity'']] were badly damaged but escaped the harbour. Two trawlers disintegrated in the attack. Later, the passenger steamer {{SS|Fenella|1936|6}} sank with 600 men aboard at the pier but the men were able to get off. The paddle steamer {{HMS|Crested Eagle}} suffered a direct hit, caught fire, and sank with severe casualties. The raiders also destroyed the two rail-owned ships, the {{SS|Lorina|1918|6}} and the {{SS|Normannia|1911|6}}.{{sfn|Smith|2011|p=138}} Of the five major German attacks, just two were contested by RAF fighters; the British lost 16 fighters in nine patrols. German losses amounted to 11 Ju 87s destroyed or damaged.{{sfn|Jackson|1974|p=118}}\n\nOn 30 May, Churchill received word that all British divisions were now behind the defensive lines, along with more than half of the French First Army.{{sfn|Churchill|1949|p=97}} By this time, the perimeter ran along a series of canals about {{convert|7|mi}} from the coast, in marshy country not suitable for tanks.{{sfn|Thompson|2011|p=226}} With the docks in the harbour rendered unusable by German air attacks, senior naval officer Captain (later Admiral) [[William Tennant (Royal Navy officer)|William Tennant]] initially ordered men to be evacuated from the beaches. When this proved too slow, he re-routed the evacuees to two long stone and concrete breakwaters, called the east and west moles, as well as the beaches. Almost 200,000 troops embarked on ships from the east mole (which stretched nearly a mile out to sea) over the next week.{{sfn|Atkin|1990|pp=150\u201351}} Once more, low clouds kept ''Luftwaffe'' activity to a minimum. Nine RAF patrols were mounted, with no German formation encountered.{{sfn|Jackson|1974|p=119}} The following day, the ''Luftwaffe'' sank one transport and damaged 12 others for 17 losses; the British claimed 38 kills, which was an exaggeration.

According to Churchill, French Admiral [[Fran\u00e7ois Darlan]] originally ordered that the British forces should receive preference, but on 31 May, he intervened at a meeting in Paris to order that the evacuation should proceed on equal terms and that the British would form the rearguard.{{sfn|Churchill|1949|p=111}} In fact, the 35,000 men who finally surrendered after covering the final evacuations were mostly French soldiers of [[2nd Light Mechanized Division (France)|2nd Light Mechanized Division]] and the [[68th Infantry Division (France)|68th Infantry Division]].{{sfn|Atkin|1990|p=219}}{{sfn|Stewart|2008|p=115}} Their resistance allowed the evacuation effort to be extended to 4 June, on which date another 26,175 Frenchmen were transported to England.{{sfn|Thompson|2011|p=306}}\n\nThe evacuation was presented to the German public as an overwhelming and decisive German victory.

The operation commenced after large numbers of [[Belgian Armed Forces|Belgian]], [[British Army|British]], and [[French Army|French]] troops were cut off and surrounded by [[German Army (1935\u20131945)|German troops]] during the six-week [[Battle of France]]. In a speech to the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]], British Prime Minister [[Winston Churchill]] called this \"a colossal military disaster\", saying \"the whole root and core and brain of the British Army\" had been stranded at Dunkirk and seemed about to perish or be captured.{{sfn|Churchill|2003|p=212}} In his \"[[we shall fight on the beaches]]\" speech on 4 June, he hailed their rescue as a \"miracle of deliverance\".{{sfn|Safire|2004|p=146}}\n\nAfter [[Nazi Germany]] [[Invasion of Poland|invaded Poland]] in September 1939, France and the [[British Empire]] declared war on Germany and imposed an [[Blockade of Germany (1939-45)|economic blockade]]. The [[British Expeditionary Force (World War II)|British Expeditionary Force]] (BEF) was sent to help defend France. After the [[Phoney War]] of October 1939 to April 1940, Germany [[Battle of Belgium|invaded Belgium]], the [[Battle of the Netherlands|Netherlands]], and [[Battle of France|France]] on 10 May 1940. Three [[panzer corps]] attacked through the [[Ardennes]] and drove northwest to the [[English Channel]]. By 21 May, German forces had trapped the BEF, the remains of the Belgian forces, and three French [[field army|field armies]] along the northern coast of France. BEF commander [[General (British Army)|General]] [[John Vereker, 6th Viscount Gort|Viscount Gort]] immediately saw evacuation across the Channel as the best course of action, and began planning a withdrawal to Dunkirk, the closest good port.\n\nLate on 23 May, a halt order was issued by ''[[Generaloberst]]'' [[Gerd von Rundstedt]], commander of [[Army Group A]]. [[Adolf Hitler]] approved this order the next day, and had the [[Oberkommando der Wehrmacht|German High Command]] send confirmation to the front. Destroying the trapped BEF, French, and Belgian armies was left to the ''[[Luftwaffe]]'' until the order was rescinded on 26 May. This gave Allied forces time to construct defensive works and pull back large numbers of troops to fight the [[Battle of Dunkirk]]. From 28 to 31 May, in the [[Siege of Lille (1940)|Siege of Lille]], the remaining 40,000 men of the once-formidable French First Army fought a delaying action against seven German [[Division (military)|divisions]], including three [[Panzer division|armoured divisions]].\n\nOn the first day only 7,669 Allied soldiers were evacuated, but by the end of the eighth day, 338,226 had been rescued by a hastily assembled fleet of over 800 vessels. Many troops were able to embark from the harbour's protective [[mole (architecture)|mole]] onto 39 British [[Royal Navy]] [[destroyer]]s, 4 [[Royal Canadian Navy]] destroyers,{{sfn|McIntyre|2017}} at least 3 [[French Navy]] destroyers, and a variety of civilian merchant ships. Others had to wade out from the beaches, waiting for hours in shoulder-deep water. Some were ferried to the larger ships by what became known as the [[Little Ships of Dunkirk]], a [[flotilla]] of hundreds of [[merchant marine]] boats, [[fishing boat]]s, [[pleasure craft]], [[yacht]]s, and [[Lifeboat (rescue)|lifeboats]] called into service from Britain. The BEF lost 68,000 soldiers during the French campaign and had to abandon nearly all of its tanks, vehicles, and equipment. In his 4 June speech, Churchill also reminded the country that \"we must be very careful not to assign to this deliverance the attributes of a victory. Wars are not won by evacuations.\"{{sfn|Churchill|1949|p=115}}\n\n==Background==\n{{Further|Battle of France}}\nIn September 1939, after [[Nazi Germany]] [[invasion of Poland|invaded Poland]], the United Kingdom sent the [[British Expeditionary Force (World War II)|British Expeditionary Force]] (BEF) to aid in the defence of France, landing at [[Cherbourg]], [[Nantes]], and [[Saint-Nazaire]]. By May 1940 the force consisted of ten [[Division (military)|divisions]] in three [[corps]] under the command of General [[John Vereker, 6th Viscount Gort]].{{sfn|Thompson|2011|p=9}}{{sfn|Thompson|2011|p=7}} Working with the BEF were the [[Belgian Armed Forces|Belgian Army]] and the French [[First Army (France)|First]], [[Seventh Army (France)|Seventh]], and [[Ninth Army (France)|Ninth]] Armies.{{sfn|Thompson|2011|p=305}}\n\nDuring the 1930s, the French had constructed the [[Maginot Line]], a series of fortifications along their border with Germany. This line had been designed to deter a German invasion across the Franco-German border and funnel an attack into Belgium, which could then be met by the best divisions of the [[French Army]]. Thus, any future war would take place outside of French territory, [[Zone rouge|avoiding a repeat]] of the [[First World War]].{{sfn|Jackson|2003|p=33}}{{sfn|Roth|2010|p=6}} The area immediately to the north of the Maginot Line was covered by the heavily wooded [[Ardennes]] region,{{sfn|Kaufmann|Kaufmann|2007|p=23}} which French General [[Philippe P\u00e9tain]] declared to be \"impenetrable\" as long as \"special provisions\" were taken. He believed that any enemy force emerging from the forest would be vulnerable to a [[Pincer movement|pincer attack]] and destroyed.

Due to shortages of personnel, many small craft crossed the Channel with civilian crews.{{sfn|Atkin|1990|p=198}}\n\nThe first of the \"little ships\" arrived at Dunkirk on 28 May.{{sfn|Thompson|2011|p=229}} The wide sand beaches meant that large vessels could not get anywhere near the shore, and even small craft had to stop about {{convert|100|yd|m}} from the waterline and wait for the soldiers to wade out.{{sfn|Thompson|2011|p=225}} In many cases, personnel would abandon their boat upon reaching a larger ship, and subsequent evacuees had to wait for boats to drift ashore with the tide before they could make use of them.{{sfn|Atkin|1990|p=199}} In most areas on the beaches, soldiers queued up with their units and patiently awaited their turn to leave. But at times, panicky soldiers had to be warned off at gunpoint when they attempted to rush to the boats out of turn.{{sfn|Atkin|1990|pp=167\u201368}} In addition to ferrying out on boats, soldiers at [[De Panne]] and Bray-Dunes constructed improvised jetties by driving rows of abandoned vehicles onto the beach at low tide, anchoring them with sandbags, and connecting them with wooden walkways.{{sfn|Atkin|1990|pp=214\u201315}}\n\n==Aftermath==\n===Analysis===\n{|class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" align=right style=\"text-align: right; margin-left: 2px;\"\n|+ Troops landed from Dunkirk<br>27 May \u2013 4 June{{sfn|Thompson|2011|p=306}}\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" | Date\n! scope=\"col\" | Beaches\n! scope=\"col\" | Harbour\n! scope=\"col\" | Total\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 27 May\n| \u2014\n| 7,669\n| 7,669\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 28 May\n| 5,930\n| 11,874\n| 17,804\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 29 May\n| 13,752\n| 33,558\n| 47,310\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 30 May\n| 29,512\n| 24,311\n| 53,823\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 31 May\n| 22,942\n| 45,072\n| 68,014\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 1 June\n| 17,348\n| 47,081\n| 64,429\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 2 June\n| 6,695\n| 19,561\n| 26,256\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 3 June\n| 1,870\n| 24,876\n| 26,746\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 4 June\n| 622\n| 25,553\n| 26,175\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | '''Totals'''\n| '''98,671'''\n| '''239,555'''\n| '''338,226'''\n|}\n{{See also|Battle of Abbeville|Operation Cycle|Operation Ariel}}\nBefore the operation was completed, the prognosis had been gloomy, with Churchill warning the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] on 28 May to expect \"hard and heavy tidings\".{{sfn|Churchill|1949|p=99}} Subsequently, Churchill referred to the outcome as a miracle, and the British press presented the evacuation as a \"disaster turned to triumph\" so successfully that Churchill had to remind the country in a speech to the House of Commons on 4 June that \"we must be very careful not to assign to this deliverance the attributes of a victory. Wars are not won by evacuations.\"{{sfn|Churchill|1949|p=115}} [[Andrew Roberts (historian)|Andrew Roberts]] comments that the confusion over the Dunkirk evacuation is illustrated by two of the best books on it being called \"Strange Defeat\" and \"Strange Victory\".{{sfn|Roberts|2009|p=37}} \n\nThree British divisions and a host of logistic and labour troops were cut off to the south of the Somme by the German \"race to the sea\". At the end of May, a further two divisions began moving to France with the hope of establishing a [[British Expeditionary Force (World War II)#The Second BEF and Operation Ariel|Second BEF]]. The majority of the [[51st (Highland) Division]] was forced to surrender on 12 June, but almost 192,000 Allied personnel, 144,000 of them British, were evacuated through various French ports from 15\u201325 June under the codename [[Operation Ariel]].{{sfn|Ellis|2004|pp=296\u2013305}} The Germans marched into [[Paris]] on 14 June and France surrendered eight days later.{{sfn|Atkin|1990|pp=232\u201334}}\n\nThe more than 100,000 French troops evacuated from Dunkirk were quickly and efficiently shuttled to camps in various parts of south-western England, where they were temporarily lodged before being repatriated.{{sfn|Looseley|2005|p=}} British ships ferried French troops to [[Brest, France|Brest]], [[Cherbourg-Octeville|Cherbourg]], and other ports in [[Normandy]] and [[Brittany]], although only about half of the repatriated troops were redeployed against the Germans before the surrender of France. For many French soldiers, the Dunkirk evacuation represented only a few weeks' delay before being killed or captured by the German army after their return to France.{{sfn|Mordal|1968|p=496}} Of the French soldiers evacuated from France in June 1940, about 3,000 joined [[Charles de Gaulle]]'s [[Free French]] army in Britain.{{sfn|Nadeau|Barlow|2003|p=89}}\n\nIn France, the unilateral British decision to evacuate through Dunkirk rather than counter-attack to the south, and the perceived preference of the Royal Navy for evacuating British forces at the expense of the French, led to some bitter resentment. According to Churchill, French Admiral [[Fran\u00e7ois Darlan]] originally ordered that the British forces should receive preference, but on 31 May, he intervened at a meeting in Paris to order that the evacuation should proceed on equal terms and that the British would form the rearguard.{{sfn|Churchill|1949|p=111}} In fact, the 35,000 men who finally surrendered after covering the final evacuations were mostly French soldiers of [[2nd Light Mechanized Division (France)|2nd Light Mechanized Division]] and the [[68th Infantry Division (France)|68th Infantry Division]].{{sfn|Atkin|1990|p=219}}{{sfn|Stewart|2008|p=115}} Their resistance allowed the evacuation effort to be extended to 4 June, on which date another 26,175 Frenchmen were transported to England.{{sfn|Thompson|2011|p=306}}\n\nThe evacuation was presented to the German public as an overwhelming and decisive German victory. On 5 June 1940, Hitler stated \"Dunkirk has fallen! 40,000 French and English troops are all that remains of the formerly great armies. Immeasurable quantities of materiel have been captured.

Quietdrive released their first album, ''[[When All That's Left Is You]]'', on May 30, 2006, on [[Epic Records]]. In April 2008, Quietdrive left Epic Records and released an album titled ''[[Deliverance (Quietdrive album)|Deliverance]]'' on October 14, 2008, with the [[The Militia Group|Militia Group]]. In 2009, they left Militia Group and released an independent EP titled ''Close Your Eyes'' on their own record label, [[Sneaker 2 Bombs Records]]. Their third full-length album, ''[[Quietdrive (album)|Quietdrive]]'', was released on December 14, 2010, and a full-length album, ''Up or Down'', on April 24, 2012.  ''[[The Ghost of What You Used to Be]]'' was released on December 16, 2014.\n\n==History==\nThe original members of the band attended [[Sultana High School]] in Hesperia, California, and in ninth grade, Brandon Lanier started telling Droo Hastings that he was a great drummer  and that they should start a band with him and his friend Justin Bonhiver. Initially, the band was a [[Trio (music)|trio]] with Hastings as lead singer and bass guitar, Lanier playing drums, and Bonhiver on guitar.<ref name=\"sctimes\">{{cite web |url=http://www.sctimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20080424/ENT/104240050/1005 |title=23rd Annual Mississippi Music Fest |publisher=St. Cloud Times |last= Hammer |first= Adam |date= 2008-04-24 |accessdate=2008-05-27}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref> The band posted an audition for a lead singer on [[MP3.com]]. [[Kevin Truckenmiller]] entered the band after submitting his solo work, including an early incarnation of the song \"I Go Both Ways\", which was named after their friend, Jennings Lane. Matt Kirby began attending [[College of Saint Benedict/Saint John's University|Saint John's University]] with Truckenmiller.<ref name=\"emopunk\">{{cite web|url=http://www.emotionalpunk.com/interview/32/ |title=In person Interview |date=2006-05-30 |last=Jones |first=Liz |publisher=Emotional Punk |accessdate=2008-05-27 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071107065636/http://www.emotionalpunk.com/interview/32/ |archivedate=November 7, 2007 }}</ref> The group eventually joined together and formed in 2002 under the name \"Sneaker 2 Bombs,\" a hard rock band which reflected the evolving Minneapolis local music scene.<ref name=\"emopunk\"/>\n\nQuietdrive initially built a following at [[The Garage (Burnsville, Minnesota)|The Garage]] in [[Burnsville, Minnesota]].<ref>{{cite web\n |last=Hoffman \n |first=Kevin (ed.) \n |url=http://www.citypages.com/bestof2006/sexdrugsrocknroll/summary.asp \n |title=Best of the City Pages 2006 \n |date=2006-04-25 \n |publisher=City Pages \n |accessdate=2008-05-27 \n |url-status=dead \n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060515034110/http://www.citypages.com/bestof2006/sexdrugsrocknroll/summary.asp \n |archivedate=May 15, 2006 \n}}</ref>{{Synthesis inline|date=May 2008}} The band pursued music venues in Minneapolis but found better connection with younger crowds and stayed between suburban and city clubs. As Quietdrive, the band recorded demo songs with Eric Trelstad.  These songs were heard by Will.I.Am from Black Eyed Peas during a visit to Minneapolis recording studio IPR.  Will arranged for the band to retain attorney Peter Lewitt and to showcase in Los Angeles but executives from Interscope passed on signing the band.  Afterwards, Truckenmiller began strongly to consider reorganizing the band with inclusion of Matt Kirby.  By April 2004, Kirby was officially made a band member and Sneaker2bombs began live performances in local bars including The Lodge.   Truckenmiller and Kirby also performed as an acoustic duo at the graduation night for Holy Angels Academy High School in June 2004.\n\nThe band put Sneaker2bombs recordings on music industry mp3 sites and Chris Foitle, an intern at Epic Records in Santa Monica, began contacting Bonhiver and Truckenmiller.  In July 2004, Epic arranged to see the band perform in Minneapolis with the assistance of Greg Sheldon.  Pete Giberga, a Vice President of A&R at Epic's Santa Monica's office, flew in and decided to sign the band.  Giberga was familiar with Sui Generis, a young emo act from Apple Valley who Giberga unsuccessfully pursued for Epic in 2003.  In early August 2004, Giberga contacted attorney Lewitt and offered a deal memo binding Quietdrive to Epic.  Truckenmiller consented.   Over the next four months, the band sought advice from industry veterans including Danny Nozell, and emerged with the decision to dismiss Lewitt, hire Sui Generis attorney Jeff Biederman, and negotiate a long form contract with Epic.  During this time, Atlantic Records also expressed interest in meeting with the band but that interest was held in check by Epic's deal memo and Epic's executive intimations that it would pursue legal action if it lost the band to another label.\n\nIn November 2004, the band flew to New York and met with Epic department heads, including head of A&R Ben Goldman, label chief Steve Barnett, head of marketing Lee Stimmel, and radio-promo heads Joel Klaiman and [[Jacqueline Saturn]].  Following that visit, final terms were negotiated and a long form was signed.\n\n''[[When All That's Left Is You]]'' is Quietdrive's first [[long play|LP]], produced, engineered and mixed by Matt Kirkwold and James Harley of World Record Productions with additional mixing by [[Chris Lord-Alge]] and [[Mark Endert]], was released in May 2006. Its first single was \"Rise from the Ashes\" and was used on [[Electronic Arts]]' ''[[NHL 07]]'' soundtrack. In 2006, the band released a cover version of the [[Cyndi Lauper]] song \"[[Time After Time (Cyndi Lauper song)|Time After Time]]\" to nationwide radio play. The song is also used for the [[WNBA]] \"Have You Seen Her?\" advertising campaign. The song became a minor hit on pop radio, reaching No.&nbsp;25 on the syndicated ''[[American Top 40]]'' countdown show. It was also used on the soundtrack of the 2006 feature film, ''[[John Tucker Must Die]]'', and in the trailer for the 2008 remake of the film ''[[Prom Night (2008 film)|Prom Night]]''.\n\nAfter the CD release into 2007, the band had a lengthy US tour and was the \"Artist of the Month\" on [[Xbox Live]] in January 2007. Quietdrive, with producers Kirkwold and Harley, released a new single titled \"Pretend\" on their  AbsolutePunk.net page in early 2007 for fans. Though the band garnered success with Epic Records, in April 2008 they cancelled their contract, partly citing the restricting management of the major music industry.<ref name=\"sctimes\"/>\n\nQuietdrive released their second full-length album ''[[Deliverance (Quietdrive album)|Deliverance]]'' on October 14, 2008, and supported this album with an extensive tour with announced dates in the US, UK and Japan.<ref name='Deliverance Tour'>{{cite web|url=http://www.quietdrivemusic.com/tour |title=Quietdrive Deliverance Tour |accessdate=2008-10-14 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080913233455/http://quietdrivemusic.com/tour |archivedate=September 13, 2008 }}</ref>\n\nQuietdrive released their EP \"Close Your Eyes\" independently on October 13, 2009. Their first single was \"Jessica\". Robby Starbuck produced the music video, which premiered on buzznet.com on December 15, 2009.  Shortly after the release of ''Close Your Eyes'', Matt Kirby decided to leave the band.  In the summer of 2010, bassist Droo Hastings also decided to leave Quietdrive while the band was touring in support of ''Close Your Eyes''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.myspace.com/quietdrive|title=Quietdrive - Listen and  Stream Free Music, Albums, New Releases, Photos, Videos|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nMatt Kirby left the band due his first child being born. He became the band's manager shortly after. Several guitarists filled in for him at live shows. including Ryan Irey and Jack Swagger (Machine 22).\n\nThe band released their [[Quietdrive (album)|self-titled]] third studio album on December 14, 2010.<ref>http://www.quietdrivemusic.com/</ref>\n\nIn the summer of 2010 Droo Hastings left the band to pursue his own music and he also was expecting his first child. The band didn't make an official announcement at first. They took him off the official members area on Facebook and fans speculated that he had left the band and the band confirmed soon after. Droo still remains good friends with all the members of Quietdrive and frequents their shows in the Twin Cities.\n\nThey were looking for a full-time guitarist and bassist to fill Kirby and Droo's positions in the band. Will Caesar auditioned sometime in mid-2010 and Brice Niehaus auditioned for bassist soon after that. They both played in Milwaukee in August 2010 for the first time with the whole band which Will has said was basically their final audition for the band. Soon after that they were both added as official members of Quietdrive on their official Facebook page.\n\nQuietdrive began a fundraising project on [[Kickstarter]], and on July 31, 2011, just two hours before their deadline, the band exceeded their goal of $15,000 to record the cover album \"Your Record Our Spin\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1440365657/your-record-our-spin|title=Your Record, Our Spin|publisher=}}</ref>  The band began recording in October 2011,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1440365657/your-record-our-spin/posts|title=Your Record, Our Spin|publisher=}}</ref> and intended the album to include 10 songs voted on by fans and one original song.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://yourrecordourspin.com/song_list.php |title=Archived copy |accessdate=September 9, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110823102236/http://yourrecordourspin.com/song_list.php |archivedate=August 23, 2011 }}</ref> In late December 2011, fans who donated $10 or more via Kickstarter began receiving their copy of the album; the final version only included the ten songs voted on by Kickstarter-donating fans, with an original eleventh track available later for digital download via a password distributed to those who had donated to the fundraising campaign.\n\nOn February 1, 2012, Quietdrive released their single \"Until the End (Acoustic)\" on iTunes, with all proceeds going to the Dean Randazzo Cancer Foundation.  A  music video was released on YouTube that same day, featuring the Grand Nationals, Colin Kassekert and [[Phil Costa (American football)|Phil Costa]] of the [[Dallas Cowboys]].\n\nOn April 24, 2012, Quietdrive released their fourth studio album titled ''Up or Down''. Originally it was going to be an eight-song EP that was to be released late 2011 or early 2012. The release was changed to late spring 2012 due to unforeseen circumstances. In the past, Truckenmiller was the primary songwriter but due to Caesar's writing experience in previous jobs him and Truckenmiller cowrote many of the songs on the album.\n\nOn October 10, 2012, Bonhiver announced he was leaving the band to pursue other interests<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10151104181103506&set=a.144580528505.116347.6016878505&type=1|title=Quietdrive - Goodbyes are never easy.

It was originally planned to release it in mid-2014 but they delayed it to December to release it in the U.S. shortly before their annual holiday show.\n\nIn December 2014, Caesar quit as a full-time member of Quietdrive but still plays if no one else is available. In 2015 they did not have plans to release another record but still tour occasionally. The members of the band rotate depending on who is available, including previous members Justin Bonhiver, Droo Hastings, and Matt Kirby.\n\nOn April 23, 2019, Quietdrive announced that they were reuniting for their first public show in nearly 4 years, and promised \"a lot of surprises\" over the coming summer and fall.<ref>{{Cite

Quietdrive released their first album, ''[[When All That's Left Is You]]'', on May 30, 2006, on [[Epic Records]]. In April 2008, Quietdrive left Epic Records and released an album titled ''[[Deliverance (Quietdrive album)|Deliverance]]'' on October 14, 2008, with the [[The Militia Group|Militia Group]]. In 2009, they left Militia Group and released an independent EP titled ''Close Your Eyes'' on their own record label, [[Sneaker 2 Bombs Records]]. Their third full-length album, ''[[Quietdrive (album)|Quietdrive]]'', was released on December 14, 2010, and a full-length album, ''Up or Down'', on April 24, 2012.  ''[[The Ghost of What You Used to Be]]'' was released on December 16, 2014.\n\n==History==\nThe original members of the band attended [[Sultana High School]] in Hesperia, California, and in ninth grade, Brandon Lanier started telling Droo Hastings that he was a great drummer  and that they should start a band with him and his friend Justin Bonhiver. Initially, the band was a [[Trio (music)|trio]] with Hastings as lead singer and bass guitar, Lanier playing drums, and Bonhiver on guitar.<ref name=\"sctimes\">{{cite web |url=http://www.sctimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20080424/ENT/104240050/1005 |title=23rd Annual Mississippi Music Fest |publisher=St. Cloud Times |last= Hammer |first= Adam |date= 2008-04-24 |accessdate=2008-05-27}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref> The band posted an audition for a lead singer on [[MP3.com]]. [[Kevin Truckenmiller]] entered the band after submitting his solo work, including an early incarnation of the song \"I Go Both Ways\", which was named after their friend, Jennings Lane. Matt Kirby began attending [[College of Saint Benedict/Saint John's University|Saint John's University]] with Truckenmiller.<ref name=\"emopunk\">{{cite web|url=http://www.emotionalpunk.com/interview/32/ |title=In person Interview |date=2006-05-30 |last=Jones |first=Liz |publisher=Emotional Punk |accessdate=2008-05-27 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071107065636/http://www.emotionalpunk.com/interview/32/ |archivedate=November 7, 2007 }}</ref> The group eventually joined together and formed in 2002 under the name \"Sneaker 2 Bombs,\" a hard rock band which reflected the evolving Minneapolis local music scene.<ref name=\"emopunk\"/>\n\nQuietdrive initially built a following at [[The Garage (Burnsville, Minnesota)|The Garage]] in [[Burnsville, Minnesota]].<ref>{{cite web\n |last=Hoffman \n |first=Kevin (ed.) \n |url=http://www.citypages.com/bestof2006/sexdrugsrocknroll/summary.asp \n |title=Best of the City Pages 2006 \n |date=2006-04-25 \n |publisher=City Pages \n |accessdate=2008-05-27 \n |url-status=dead \n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060515034110/http://www.citypages.com/bestof2006/sexdrugsrocknroll/summary.asp \n |archivedate=May 15, 2006 \n}}</ref>{{Synthesis inline|date=May 2008}} The band pursued music venues in Minneapolis but found better connection with younger crowds and stayed between suburban and city clubs. As Quietdrive, the band recorded demo songs with Eric Trelstad.  These songs were heard by Will.I.Am from Black Eyed Peas during a visit to Minneapolis recording studio IPR.  Will arranged for the band to retain attorney Peter Lewitt and to showcase in Los Angeles but executives from Interscope passed on signing the band.  Afterwards, Truckenmiller began strongly to consider reorganizing the band with inclusion of Matt Kirby.  By April 2004, Kirby was officially made a band member and Sneaker2bombs began live performances in local bars including The Lodge.   Truckenmiller and Kirby also performed as an acoustic duo at the graduation night for Holy Angels Academy High School in June 2004.\n\nThe band put Sneaker2bombs recordings on music industry mp3 sites and Chris Foitle, an intern at Epic Records in Santa Monica, began contacting Bonhiver and Truckenmiller.  In July 2004, Epic arranged to see the band perform in Minneapolis with the assistance of Greg Sheldon.  Pete Giberga, a Vice President of A&R at Epic's Santa Monica's office, flew in and decided to sign the band.  Giberga was familiar with Sui Generis, a young emo act from Apple Valley who Giberga unsuccessfully pursued for Epic in 2003.  In early August 2004, Giberga contacted attorney Lewitt and offered a deal memo binding Quietdrive to Epic.  Truckenmiller consented.   Over the next four months, the band sought advice from industry veterans including Danny Nozell, and emerged with the decision to dismiss Lewitt, hire Sui Generis attorney Jeff Biederman, and negotiate a long form contract with Epic.  During this time, Atlantic Records also expressed interest in meeting with the band but that interest was held in check by Epic's deal memo and Epic's executive intimations that it would pursue legal action if it lost the band to another label.\n\nIn November 2004, the band flew to New York and met with Epic department heads, including head of A&R Ben Goldman, label chief Steve Barnett, head of marketing Lee Stimmel, and radio-promo heads Joel Klaiman and [[Jacqueline Saturn]].  Following that visit, final terms were negotiated and a long form was signed.\n\n''[[When All That's Left Is You]]'' is Quietdrive's first [[long play|LP]], produced, engineered and mixed by Matt Kirkwold and James Harley of World Record Productions with additional mixing by [[Chris Lord-Alge]] and [[Mark Endert]], was released in May 2006. Its first single was \"Rise from the Ashes\" and was used on [[Electronic Arts]]' ''[[NHL 07]]'' soundtrack. In 2006, the band released a cover version of the [[Cyndi Lauper]] song \"[[Time After Time (Cyndi Lauper song)|Time After Time]]\" to nationwide radio play. The song is also used for the [[WNBA]] \"Have You Seen Her?\" advertising campaign. The song became a minor hit on pop radio, reaching No.&nbsp;25 on the syndicated ''[[American Top 40]]'' countdown show. It was also used on the soundtrack of the 2006 feature film, ''[[John Tucker Must Die]]'', and in the trailer for the 2008 remake of the film ''[[Prom Night (2008 film)|Prom Night]]''.\n\nAfter the CD release into 2007, the band had a lengthy US tour and was the \"Artist of the Month\" on [[Xbox Live]] in January 2007. Quietdrive, with producers Kirkwold and Harley, released a new single titled \"Pretend\" on their  AbsolutePunk.net page in early 2007 for fans. Though the band garnered success with Epic Records, in April 2008 they cancelled their contract, partly citing the restricting management of the major music industry.<ref name=\"sctimes\"/>\n\nQuietdrive released their second full-length album ''[[Deliverance (Quietdrive album)|Deliverance]]'' on October 14, 2008, and supported this album with an extensive tour with announced dates in the US, UK and Japan.<ref name='Deliverance Tour'>{{cite web|url=http://www.quietdrivemusic.com/tour |title=Quietdrive Deliverance Tour |accessdate=2008-10-14 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080913233455/http://quietdrivemusic.com/tour |archivedate=September 13, 2008 }}</ref>\n\nQuietdrive released their EP \"Close Your Eyes\" independently on October 13, 2009. Their first single was \"Jessica\". Robby Starbuck produced the music video, which premiered on buzznet.com on December 15, 2009.  Shortly after the release of ''Close Your Eyes'', Matt Kirby decided to leave the band.  In the summer of 2010, bassist Droo Hastings also decided to leave Quietdrive while the band was touring in support of ''Close Your Eyes''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.myspace.com/quietdrive|title=Quietdrive - Listen and  Stream Free Music, Albums, New Releases, Photos, Videos|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nMatt Kirby left the band due his first child being born. He became the band's manager shortly after. Several guitarists filled in for him at live shows. including Ryan Irey and Jack Swagger (Machine 22).\n\nThe band released their [[Quietdrive (album)|self-titled]] third studio album on December 14, 2010.<ref>http://www.quietdrivemusic.com/</ref>\n\nIn the summer of 2010 Droo Hastings left the band to pursue his own music and he also was expecting his first child. The band didn't make an official announcement at first. They took him off the official members area on Facebook and fans speculated that he had left the band and the band confirmed soon after. Droo still remains good friends with all the members of Quietdrive and frequents their shows in the Twin Cities.\n\nThey were looking for a full-time guitarist and bassist to fill Kirby and Droo's positions in the band. Will Caesar auditioned sometime in mid-2010 and Brice Niehaus auditioned for bassist soon after that. They both played in Milwaukee in August 2010 for the first time with the whole band which Will has said was basically their final audition for the band. Soon after that they were both added as official members of Quietdrive on their official Facebook page.\n\nQuietdrive began a fundraising project on [[Kickstarter]], and on July 31, 2011, just two hours before their deadline, the band exceeded their goal of $15,000 to record the cover album \"Your Record Our Spin\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1440365657/your-record-our-spin|title=Your Record, Our Spin|publisher=}}</ref>  The band began recording in October 2011,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1440365657/your-record-our-spin/posts|title=Your Record, Our Spin|publisher=}}</ref> and intended the album to include 10 songs voted on by fans and one original song.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://yourrecordourspin.com/song_list.php |title=Archived copy |accessdate=September 9, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110823102236/http://yourrecordourspin.com/song_list.php |archivedate=August 23, 2011 }}</ref> In late December 2011, fans who donated $10 or more via Kickstarter began receiving their copy of the album; the final version only included the ten songs voted on by Kickstarter-donating fans, with an original eleventh track available later for digital download via a password distributed to those who had donated to the fundraising campaign.\n\nOn February 1, 2012, Quietdrive released their single \"Until the End (Acoustic)\" on iTunes, with all proceeds going to the Dean Randazzo Cancer Foundation.  A  music video was released on YouTube that same day, featuring the Grand Nationals, Colin Kassekert and [[Phil Costa (American football)|Phil Costa]] of the [[Dallas Cowboys]].\n\nOn April 24, 2012, Quietdrive released their fourth studio album titled ''Up or Down''. Originally it was going to be an eight-song EP that was to be released late 2011 or early 2012. The release was changed to late spring 2012 due to unforeseen circumstances. In the past, Truckenmiller was the primary songwriter but due to Caesar's writing experience in previous jobs him and Truckenmiller cowrote many of the songs on the album.\n\nOn October 10, 2012, Bonhiver announced he was leaving the band to pursue other interests<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10151104181103506&set=a.144580528505.116347.6016878505&type=1|title=Quietdrive - Goodbyes are never easy.

It was originally planned to release it in mid-2014 but they delayed it to December to release it in the U.S. shortly before their annual holiday show.\n\nIn December 2014, Caesar quit as a full-time member of Quietdrive but still plays if no one else is available. In 2015 they did not have plans to release another record but still tour occasionally. The members of the band rotate depending on who is available, including previous members Justin Bonhiver, Droo Hastings, and Matt Kirby.\n\nOn April 23, 2019, Quietdrive announced that they were reuniting for their first public show in nearly 4 years, and promised \"a lot of surprises\" over the coming summer and fall.<ref>{{Cite
