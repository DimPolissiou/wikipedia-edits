His capture of the southern caverns of [[Cappadocia]] and the fortress of [[Ancyra]] in 739 marked the last Umayyad military gains in the [[Arab\u2013Byzantine wars|wars with Byzantium]]. Despite the abortive attempts by his father Caliph [[Hisham ibn Abd al-Malik]] ({{reign|724|743}}) to install Maslama as his chosen successor in place of [[al-Walid II|al-Walid ibn Yazid]], Maslama became a close companion of al-Walid and defended him from his father's machinations. As a result, he was spared the fate of his brothers who were imprisoned upon al-Walid's accession in 743. Nothing is heard of Maslama afterward and he may have been killed in a massacre of the [[Umayyad dynasty|Umayyad family]] by the [[Abbasids]] following their [[Abbasid Revolution|takeover of the Caliphate]] in 750.\n\n==Early life and plans for caliphal succession==\nMaslama was the son of the [[Umayyad]] caliph [[Hisham ibn Abd al-Malik]] ({{reign|724|743}}) and the latter's wife Umm Hakim, the daughter of [[Yahya ibn al-Hakam]], a brother of Hisham's paternal grandfather Caliph [[Marwan I]] ({{reign|684|685}}). Umm Hakim, like her mother Zaynab bint Abd al-Rahman, was well known for her beauty, and her fondness for wine was the subject of contemporary poetic verses preserved in the ''[[Kitab al-aghani]]'' (Book of Songs) of [[Abu al-Faraj al-Isfahani]] (d. 967).{{sfn|Hillenbrand|1989|p=90, note 455}} Maslama was married to Umm Salama bint Ya'qub ibn Salama, a member of the aristocratic [[Banu Makhzum]] clan and a fourth-generation descendant of [[al-Walid ibn al-Walid]] (brother of [[Khalid ibn al-Walid]]).{{sfn|Elad|2016|p=289}} She later married the first [[Abbasid Caliphate|Abbasid]] caliph [[as-Saffah]] ({{reign|750|754}}).{{sfn|Elad|2016|p=289}}\n\nFollowing his accession, Hisham attempted to secure Maslama as his successor in place of the appointed successor, his predecessor's son [[al-Walid II|al-Walid ibn Yazid II]] (known as al-Walid II).{{sfn|Marsham|2009|pp=119\u2013120}} Hisham's initial attempts following the Hajj of 735 to persuade al-Walid to step down in favor of Maslama or give Maslama the oath of allegiance as al-Walid's successor were rejected by al-Walid.{{sfn|Hillenbrand|1989|p=89}}{{sfn|Bosworth|1994|p=279}}{{sfn|Judd|2008|p=453}} Afterward, Hisham sought to undermine al-Walid and secretly gathered support for Maslama.{{sfn|Hillenbrand|1989|p=89}} The latter's nomination was supported by his paternal uncle, the famous general [[Maslama ibn Abd al-Malik]], Hisham's maternal grandfather, the former governor of [[Medina]] [[Hisham ibn Isma'il al-Makhzumi]],{{sfn|Marsham|2009|p=121}} and his sons [[Ibrahim ibn Hisham ibn Isma'il al-Makhzumi|Ibrahim]] and [[Muhammad ibn Hisham ibn Isma'il al-Makhzumi|Muhammad]], and the sons of the influential [[Banu Abs]] chief of [[Jund Qinnasrin|northern Syria]], [[al-Qa'qa' ibn Khulayd]].{{sfn|Hillenbrand|1989|p=89}} Maslama's mother Umm Hakim also lobbied for her son's succession.{{sfn|Marsham|2009|p=131, note 30}} Opposed to Maslama's proposed succession was [[Khalid al-Qasri]], the governor of Iraq, to which Maslama responded by insulting him and his dead brother [[Asad ibn Abdallah al-Qasri|Asad]].{{sfn|Hillenbrand|1989|pp=90\u201391}} Maslama ibn Abd al-Malik's death in the late 730s was a major setback to Hisham's succession plans as it represented the loss of the plan's key supporter in the [[Umayyad dynasty|Umayyad family]].{{sfn|Marsham|2009|p=121}}\n\n==Career under Hisham==\n[[File:View of Cappadocia edit.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Maslama seized the southern, cavernous part of [[Cappadocia]] (''area pictured in 2006'') in an expedition against the Byzantines in {{circa|739}}]]\n\nDespite the animosity toward al-Walid by Hisham and the latter's stern and austere lifestyle, Maslama had become al-Walid's drinking companion, which al-Walid used to mock Hisham when the caliph reprimanded him for consuming wine.{{sfn|Hillenbrand|1989|pp=89\u201390}} His insult to Hisham became a celebrated poetic verse:<blockquote>Oh you who ask about our religion / we follow the religion of Abu Shakir (Maslama) <br /> We drink the wine both straight and mixed / sometimes warm and sometimes chilled{{sfn|Judd|2008|p=453}}</blockquote>\n\nIn response, Hisham castigated Maslama, ordering him to attend the congregational [[Friday prayers]].{{sfn|Hillenbrand|1989|p=90}} According to the historian [[al-Mada'ini]] (d. 843), Maslama thereafter became devoted to religion and \"behaved in a steady and gentle manner\".{{sfn|Hillenbrand|1989|p=90}} Along with a number of his brothers, Maslama came under the tutelage of one of the major Muslim scholars of his time, [[Ibn Shihab al-Zuhri]].{{sfn|Judd|2014|p=55}} Hisham appointed Maslama to lead the [[Hajj]] pilgrimage to [[Mecca]] in November 737, accompanied by Ibn al-Zuhri,{{sfn|Blankinship|1989|p=166}} who advised him in the operation.{{sfn|Judd|2014|p=55}} During the Hajj expedition, he distributed money to the people of Medina and Mecca.{{sfn|Hillenbrand|1989|p=90}}\n\nMaslama commanded the summer expedition against the [[Byzantine Empire]] in 739, taking control of al-Matamir, the cavernous southern half of [[Cappadocia]], and besieged and captured [[Ancyra]] (medieval Ankara).{{sfn|Blankinship|1994|p=169}} Maslama's victories marked the last Umayyad captures of a Byzantine fortress or town.{{sfn|Blankinship|1994|p=169}} The following summer the Umayyads launched the largest expedition against the Byzantines during Hisham's reign.{{sfn|Blankinship|1994|p=169}} The main expedition was led by Maslama's brother [[Sulayman ibn Hisham|Sulayman]], and Maslama may have commanded a separate expedition during the same year.{{sfn|Blankinship|1994|p=169}} The Umayyads inflicted heavy losses throughout western Anatolia but were beaten back by the Byzantines without any territorial gains, while two of the Caliphate's leading generals, [[Abdallah al-Battal]] and [[Malik ibn Shu'ayb]] were slain by the forces of Byzantine emperor [[Leo III the Isaurian|Leo III]].{{sfn|Blankinship|1994|p=169}}\n\n==Later life and death==\nHisham died in February 743 and Maslama led the funeral prayers.{{sfn|Hillenbrand|1989|p=72}} Al-Walid acceded to the caliphate and immediately ordered that Hisham's sons at [[Resafa|Rusafa]], near [[Palmyra]], be arrested by their cousin [[al-Abbas ibn al-Walid]], but expressly forbade that Maslama or his household be disturbed in deference to their old companionship and Maslama's defense of al-Walid from Caliph Hisham.{{sfn|Judd|2008|p=453}}{{sfn|Hillenbrand|1989|p=100}} Al-Walid's endearment and generosity toward Maslama is noted in the poems preserved by al-Isfahani.{{sfn|Hillenbrand|1989|pp=89\u201390, note 451}} Although he avoided arrest by al-Walid, nothing is heard of him in the sources thereafter and the historian [[Clifford Edmund Bosworth]] presumes he may have been executed by the Abbasids during the massacre of the Umayyad family at the river of [[Antipatris]] (Nahr Abi Futrus in Arabic) in 750, following the Umayyad dynasty's collapse in the [[Abbasid Revolution]].{{sfn|Bosworth|1994|p=279}}\n\nMaslama had been infertile until he was reportedly healed by the father of [[Khalid ibn Barmak]], the progenitor of the [[Barmakid]] family who came under the patronage of Caliph Hisham.{{sfn|Bosworth|1994|pp=270\u2013271, 271 note 23}} Maslama and Khalid grew up in the same palace in Hisham's court. After his treatment, Maslama and his wife Umm Salama had their son Sa'id, who was nicknamed \"al-Barmaki\".{{sfn|Bosworth|1994|p=274}} Sa'id may have been spared persecution following the Abbasid Revolution because the Abbasid caliph al-Saffah was his stepfather.{{sfn|Bosworth|1994|pp=279\u2013280}} Sa'id became an [[r\u0101w\u012b|oral transmitter]] of historical tradition in the early Abbasid period.{{sfn|Bosworth|1994|pp=279\u2013280}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n*{{The History of al-Tabari |volume=25 |url={{Google Books||plainurl=y}}}}\n*{{The End of the Jihad State}}\n*{{cite journal |last1=Bosworth |first1=C.

historian [[al-Mada'ini]] (d. 843), Maslama thereafter became devoted to religion and \"behaved in a steady and gentle manner\".{{sfn|Hillenbrand|1989|p=90}} Along with a number of his brothers, Maslama came under the tutelage of one of the major Muslim scholars of his time, [[Ibn Shihab al-Zuhri]].{{sfn|Judd|2014|p=55}} Hisham appointed Maslama to lead the [[Hajj]] pilgrimage to [[Mecca]] in November 737, accompanied by Ibn al-Zuhri,{{sfn|Blankinship|1989|p=166}} who advised him in the operation.{{sfn|Judd|2014|p=55}} During the Hajj expedition, he distributed money to the people of Medina and Mecca.{{sfn|Hillenbrand|1989|p=90}}\n\nMaslama commanded the summer expedition against the [[Byzantine Empire]] in 739, taking control of al-Matamir, the cavernous southern half of [[Cappadocia]], and besieged and captured [[Ancyra]] (medieval Ankara).{{sfn|Blankinship|1994|p=169}} Maslama's victories marked the last Umayyad captures of a Byzantine fortress or town.{{sfn|Blankinship|1994|p=169}} The following summer the Umayyads launched the largest expedition against the Byzantines during Hisham's reign.{{sfn|Blankinship|1994|p=169}} The main expedition was led by Maslama's brother [[Sulayman ibn Hisham|Sulayman]], and Maslama may have commanded a separate expedition during the same year.{{sfn|Blankinship|1994|p=169}} The Umayyads inflicted heavy losses throughout western Anatolia but were beaten back by the Byzantines without any territorial gains, while two of the Caliphate's leading generals, [[Abdallah al-Battal]] and [[Malik ibn Shu'ayb]] were slain by the forces of Byzantine emperor [[Leo III the Isaurian|Leo III]].{{sfn|Blankinship|1994|p=169}}\n\n==Later life and death==\nHisham died in February 743 and Maslama led the funeral prayers.{{sfn|Hillenbrand|1989|p=72}} Al-Walid acceded to the caliphate and immediately ordered that Hisham's sons at [[Resafa|Rusafa]], near [[Palmyra]], be arrested by their cousin [[al-Abbas ibn al-Walid]], but expressly forbade that Maslama or his household be disturbed in deference to their old companionship and Maslama's defense of al-Walid from Caliph Hisham.{{sfn|Judd|2008|p=453}}{{sfn|Hillenbrand|1989|p=100}} Al-Walid's endearment and generosity toward Maslama is noted in the poems preserved by al-Isfahani.{{sfn|Hillenbrand|1989|pp=89\u201390, note 451}} Although he avoided arrest by al-Walid, nothing is heard of him in the sources thereafter and the historian [[Clifford Edmund Bosworth]] presumes he may have been executed by the Abbasids during the massacre of the Umayyad family at the river of [[Antipatris]] (Nahr Abi Futrus in Arabic) in 750, following the Umayyad dynasty's collapse in the [[Abbasid Revolution]].{{sfn|Bosworth|1994|p=279}}\n\nMaslama had been infertile until he was reportedly healed by the father of [[Khalid ibn Barmak]], the progenitor of the [[Barmakid]] family who came under the patronage of Caliph Hisham.{{sfn|Bosworth|1994|pp=270\u2013271, 271 note 23}} Maslama and Khalid grew up in the same palace in Hisham's court. After his treatment, Maslama and his wife Umm Salama had their son Sa'id, who was nicknamed \"al-Barmaki\".{{sfn|Bosworth|1994|p=274}} Sa'id may have been spared persecution following the Abbasid Revolution because the Abbasid caliph al-Saffah was his stepfather.{{sfn|Bosworth|1994|pp=279\u2013280}} Sa'id became an [[r\u0101w\u012b|oral transmitter]] of historical tradition in the early Abbasid period.{{sfn|Bosworth|1994|pp=279\u2013280}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n*{{The History of al-Tabari |volume=25 |url={{Google Books||plainurl=y}}}}\n*{{The End of the Jihad State}}\n*{{cite journal |last1=Bosworth |first1=C.

The Early [[Church Fathers]] ascribed to him authorship of both the [[Gospel of Luke]] and the [[Acts of the Apostles]], which would mean Luke contributed over a quarter of the text of the [[New Testament]], more than any other author. Prominent figures in early Christianity such as [[Jerome]] and [[Eusebius]] later reaffirmed his authorship, although a lack of conclusive evidence as to the identity of the author of the works has led to [[Authorship of Luke\u2013Acts|discussion]] in scholarly circles, both secular and religious.\n\nThe New Testament mentions Luke briefly a few times, and the [[Pauline epistles|Pauline]] [[Epistle to the Colossians]] refers to him as a physician (from Greek for 'one who heals'); thus he is thought to have been both a physician and a disciple of [[Paul the Apostle|Paul]]. Since the early years of the faith, Christians have regarded him as a [[saint]]. He is believed to have been a [[martyr]], reportedly having been hanged from an olive tree, though some believe otherwise.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09420a.htm |title= Gospel of Saint Luke |last= Aherne|first= C.|date= 1910 |website= Catholic Encyclopedia |publisher= New Advent|access-date= 14 January 2019 |quote= it is controverted whether he actually died a martyr's death.}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Roman Catholic Church]] and other major denominations venerate him as '''Saint Luke the Evangelist''' and as a [[patron saint]] of artists, physicians, [[bachelors]], surgeons, students and butchers; his [[feast day]] is 18 October.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.catholicnewsagency.com/saint/st-luke-the-evangelist-23|title=St. Luke The Evangelist|website=Catholic News Agency|access-date=16 October 2018}}</ref>\n\n== Life ==\nMany scholars believe that Luke was a [[Greeks|Greek]] physician who lived in the Greek city of [[Antioch, Turkey|Antioch]] in Ancient [[Syria (Roman province)|Syria]], although some other scholars and theologians think Luke was a [[Hellenistic Judaism|Hellenic Jew]].<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=Understanding the Bible: A Reader's Introduction|last=Harris|first=Stephen L.|publisher=Mayfield|year=1985|isbn=0-87484-696-X|edition=2nd|location=Palo Alto|pages=266\u201368|chapter=The Gospels|author-link=Stephen L.

(''Homily 18 on Second Corinthians'' on 2 Corinthians 8:18)\n\nIf one accepts that Luke was indeed the author of the Gospel bearing his name and also the ''Acts of the Apostles'', certain details of his personal life can be reasonably assumed.

The \"we\" section of ''Acts'' continues until the group leaves [[Philippi]], when his writing goes back to the third person. This change happens again when the group returns to Philippi.

The \"we\" section of ''Acts'' continues until the group leaves [[Philippi]], when his writing goes back to the third person. This change happens again when the group returns to Philippi.

He served as principal of [[Alexis I. duPont High School]] (1894\u20131903) in [[Wilmington, Delaware]], superintendent of [[New Castle County, Delaware|New Castle County]] Public Schools (1903\u20131913) in Delaware, superintendent of [[Dorchester County Public Schools]] (1913\u20131917) in Maryland, and [[Delaware Department of Education|Delaware State commissioner of Education]] (1917\u20131921).\n\nIn 1894, Spaid relocated to Delaware, where he was elected principal of Alexis I. duPont High School in Wilmington and served in this position until 1903. Spaid became superintendent of New Castle County Public Schools in 1903 and remained in this position until 1913. Throughout his tenure as superintendent, Spaid argued for compulsory education and the consolidation of New Castle County's rural public schools. In response to a shortage of teachers, Spaid instituted pay raises for some teachers in July 1906 so that they would return for the fall term. In May 1908, the Delaware State Board of Education appointed Spaid and the county superintendents to a committee charged with revising the state public school system's curriculum.\n\nSpaid received a Master of Arts degree in education from [[Columbia University]] in 1917. In November 1918, he issued a bulletin entitled, ''Our Children Must Be Educated'', in which he appealed to parents and school administrators to address rising teacher resignations, withdrawals of school children and other conditions that affected the state's public school system. He stressed that it was necessary to keep Delaware's children in school to avoid illiteracy. Under Spaid's initiative to bring efficiency to the state's public school system, the Delaware State Board of Education adopted a new school code in 1919. In May 1921, Spaid and the State Board of Education urged county superintendents and school principals to observe [[Memorial Day]] at their schools. Spaid left Delaware in 1921 and engaged in [[Chautauqua]]-related work before becoming the head of the Education Department at [[Salem University]] in [[Salem, West Virginia]], from 1926 to 1936.\n\nSpaid was a [[Natural history|naturalist]] by hobby and took hundreds of photographs, using them to illustrate his nature study articles and lecture slides. Throughout his career as a school administrator, Spaid also served as an instructor, lecturer, and speaker for multiple courses, institutes, and organizations. Spaid was also an avid writer, and he published articles in ''[[Scientific American]]'' and ''[[Country Life in America]]''. Spaid had planned to author a book on his nature studies, for which he had written notes and collected specimens; however, his home and notebooks were destroyed in a fire in 1917. Spaid died at the home of his daughter in [[Winchester, Virginia]], in 1936. According to historians [[Hu Maxwell]] and [[Howard Llewellyn Swisher]], Spaid \"placed himself in the front rank of the educational works of Delaware, and received the commendation of the press and the educators for his advanced ideas.\"<ref name=\"Maxwell 1\">{{Harvnb|Maxwell|Swisher|1897|p=730.}}</ref>\n\n== Early life and education ==\nArthur Rusmiselle Miller Spaid was born on 27&nbsp;July 1866 in [[Capon Springs, West Virginia|Capon Springs]], West Virginia, to John W.

He served as principal of [[Alexis I. duPont High School]] (1894\u20131903) in [[Wilmington, Delaware]], superintendent of [[New Castle County, Delaware|New Castle County]] Public Schools (1903\u20131913) in Delaware, superintendent of [[Dorchester County Public Schools]] (1913\u20131917) in Maryland, and [[Delaware Department of Education|Delaware State commissioner of Education]] (1917\u20131921).\n\nIn 1894, Spaid relocated to Delaware, where he was elected principal of Alexis I. duPont High School in Wilmington and served in this position until 1903. Spaid became superintendent of New Castle County Public Schools in 1903 and remained in this position until 1913. Throughout his tenure as superintendent, Spaid argued for compulsory education and the consolidation of New Castle County's rural public schools. In response to a shortage of teachers, Spaid instituted pay raises for some teachers in July 1906 so that they would return for the fall term. In May 1908, the Delaware State Board of Education appointed Spaid and the county superintendents to a committee charged with revising the state public school system's curriculum.\n\nSpaid received a Master of Arts degree in education from [[Columbia University]] in 1917. In November 1918, he issued a bulletin entitled, ''Our Children Must Be Educated'', in which he appealed to parents and school administrators to address rising teacher resignations, withdrawals of school children and other conditions that affected the state's public school system. He stressed that it was necessary to keep Delaware's children in school to avoid illiteracy. Under Spaid's initiative to bring efficiency to the state's public school system, the Delaware State Board of Education adopted a new school code in 1919. In May 1921, Spaid and the State Board of Education urged county superintendents and school principals to observe [[Memorial Day]] at their schools. Spaid left Delaware in 1921 and engaged in [[Chautauqua]]-related work before becoming the head of the Education Department at [[Salem University]] in [[Salem, West Virginia]], from 1926 to 1936.\n\nSpaid was a [[Natural history|naturalist]] by hobby and took hundreds of photographs, using them to illustrate his nature study articles and lecture slides.

Variants on his name are Jeronimus van Aken (Dijck (2000): pp. 173, 186), Jheronimus anthonissen van aken (Marijnissen ([1987]): p. 12), Jeronimus Van aeken (Marijnissen ([1987]): p. 13), Joen (Dijck (2000): pp. 170\u2013171, 174\u2013177), and Jeroen (Dijck (2000): pp. 170, 174).</ref> {{IPA-nl|je\u02d0\u02c8ro\u02d0nim\u028fs f\u0251n \u02c8a\u02d0k\u0259(n)|}};{{efn|In isolation, ''van'' is pronounced {{IPA-nl|v\u0251n||Nl-van.ogg}}.}} {{circa|1450}}&nbsp;\u2013 9 August 1516) was a [[Dutch people|Dutch]]/[[Netherlandish]] [[painter]] from [[Duchy of Brabant|Brabant]]. He is one of the most notable representatives of the [[Early Netherlandish painting]] school. His work contains fantastic illustrations of religious concepts and narratives.<ref>Catherine B. Scallen, ''The Art of the Northern Renaissance'' (Chantilly: The Teaching Company, 2007) Lecture 26</ref> Within his lifetime his work was collected in the Netherlands, Austria, and Spain, and widely copied, especially his macabre and nightmarish depictions of [[hell]].\n\nLittle is known of Bosch's life, though there are some records.  He spent most of it in the town of [['s-Hertogenbosch]], where he was born in his grandfather's house. The roots of his forefathers are in [[Nijmegen]] and [[Aachen]] (which is visible in his surname: Van Aken). His pessimistic and fantastical style cast a wide influence on northern art of the 16th century, with [[Pieter Bruegel the Elder]] being his best-known follower. Today he is seen as a hugely individualistic painter with deep insight into humanity's desires and deepest fears. Attribution has been especially difficult; today only about 25 paintings are confidently given to his hand<ref name=Siegal1Feb/> along with eight drawings. About another half dozen paintings are confidently attributed to his workshop. His most acclaimed works consist of a few [[triptych]] altarpieces, including ''[[The Garden of Earthly Delights]]''.\n\n==Life==\nHieronymus Bosch was born Jheronimus (or Joen,<ref>Dijck (2000): pp. 43\u201344. A variant on his Middle Dutch name is \"Jeroen\". Van Dijck points out that in all contemporary sources the name \"Jeroen\" is used twice, while the name \"Joen\" is used nine times, making \"Joen\" to be his probable Christian name.</ref> respectively the Latin and [[Middle Dutch]] form of the name \"Jerome\") van Aken (meaning \"from [[Aachen]]\"). He signed a number of his paintings as ''Jheronimus Bosch''.<ref>Signed works by Bosch include ''[[The Epiphany (Bosch)|The Adoration of the Magi]]'', ''[[Saint Christopher Carrying the Christ Child]]'', ''[[St. John the Evangelist on Patmos]]'', ''[[The Temptation of St Anthony (Bosch painting)|The Temptation of Saint Anthony]]'', ''[[The Hermit Saint|The Hermit Saints Triptych]]'', and ''[[The Crucifixion of St Julia]]''.</ref> The name derives from his birthplace, {{nowrap|[['s-Hertogenbosch]]}}, which is commonly called \"Den Bosch\" ('the forest').{{Citation needed|date=August 2019}}\n\nLittle is known of Bosch's life or training. He left behind no letters or diaries, and what has been identified has been taken from brief references to him in the municipal records of {{nowrap|'s-Hertogenbosch}}, and in the account books of the local order of the [[Illustrious Brotherhood of Our Blessed Lady]]. Nothing is known of his personality or his thoughts on the meaning of his art. Bosch's date of birth has not been determined with certainty. It is estimated at {{nowrap|{{circa}} 1450}} on the basis of a hand drawn portrait (which may be a self-portrait) made shortly before his death in 1516. The drawing shows the artist at an advanced age, probably in his late sixties.<ref>Gibson, 15\u201316</ref>\n\nBosch was born and lived all his life in and near {{nowrap|[['s-Hertogenbosch]]}}, a city in the [[Duchy of Brabant]]. His grandfather Jan van Aken (died 1454) was a painter and is first mentioned in the records in 1430. It is known that Jan had five sons, four of whom were also painters. Bosch's father, Anthonius van Aken (died {{circa}} 1478), acted as artistic adviser to the [[Illustrious Brotherhood of Our Blessed Lady]].<ref>Gibson, 15, 17</ref> It is generally assumed that either Bosch's father or one of his uncles taught the artist to paint, but none of their works survive.<ref>Gibson, 19</ref> Bosch first appears in the municipal record on 5 April 1474, when he is named along with two brothers and a sister.{{Citation needed|date=August 2019}}\n\n's-Hertogenbosch was a flourishing city in 15th-century [[Duchy of Brabant|Brabant]], in the south of the present-day Netherlands, at the time part of the [[Burgundian Netherlands]], and during its lifetime passing through marriage to the [[House of Habsburg|Habsburgs]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2019}} In 1463, four thousand houses in the town were destroyed by a catastrophic fire, which the then (approximately) thirteen-year-old Bosch presumably witnessed. He became a popular painter in his lifetime and often received commissions from abroad.{{Citation needed|date=August 2019}} In 1488 he joined the highly respected Brotherhood of Our Lady, a devotional confraternity of some forty influential citizens of {{nowrap|'s-Hertogenbosch}}, and seven thousand 'outer-members' from around Europe.{{Citation needed|date=August 2019}}\n\nSometime between 1479 and 1481, Bosch married Aleyt Goyaerts van den Meerveen, who was a few years his senior. The couple moved to the nearby town of Oirschot, where his wife had inherited a house and land from her wealthy family.<ref>Valery, Paul. ''The Phase of Doubt, A Critical Reflection''.</ref> An entry in the accounts of the Brotherhood of Our Lady records Bosch's death in 1516. A funeral mass served in his memory was held in the church of Saint John on 9 August of that year.<ref>Gibson, 18</ref>\n\n[[File:BoschTheCrucifixionOfStJulia.jpg|thumb|260px|left|''[[The Crucifixion of St Julia]]'' is attributed to Bosch's middle period, c. 1497.]]\n==Works==\n{{main|List of paintings by Hieronymus Bosch|Hieronymus Bosch drawings}}\nBosch produced at least sixteen triptychs, of which eight are fully intact, and another five in fragments.<ref>Jacobs, 1010</ref> Bosch's works are generally organised into three periods of his life dealing with the early works (c. 1470\u20131485), the middle period (c.1485\u20131500), and the late period (c. 1500 until his death). According to Stefan Fischer, thirteen of Bosch's surviving paintings were completed in the late period, with seven attributed to his middle period.<ref>Stefan Fischer. ''Bosch: The Complete Works.''</ref> Bosch's early period is studied in terms of his workshop activity and possibly some of his drawings. Indeed, he taught pupils in the workshop, who were influenced by him. The recent [[dendrochronological]] investigation of the oak panels by the scientists at the Bosch Research and Conservation Project<ref>[http://boschproject.org/ Bosch Research and Conservation Project], 2016</ref> led to a more precise dating of the majority of Bosch's paintings.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Luuk Hoogstede|author2=Ron Spronk|author3=Matthijs Ilsink| author4=Robert G.

About twenty five paintings remain today that can be attributed to him. In the late 16th century, [[Philip II of Spain]] acquired many of Bosch's paintings; as a result, the [[Museo del Prado|Prado Museum]] in [[Madrid]] now owns ''[[Adoration of the Magi (Bosch, Madrid)|The Adoration of the Magi]]'', ''[[The Garden of Earthly Delights]]'', the tabletop painting of ''[[The Seven Deadly Sins and the Four Last Things]]'' and ''[[The Haywain Triptych]]''.{{Citation needed|date=August 2019}}\n\n===Painting materials===\nBosch painted his works mostly on oak panels using oil as a medium. Bosch's palette was rather limited and contained the usual pigments of his time.<ref>Hoogstede et al. (2016)</ref> He mostly used [[azurite]] for blue skies and distant landscapes, green copper-based glazes and paints consisting of [[malachite]] or [[verdigris]] for foliage and foreground landscapes, and [[lead-tin-yellow]], [[ochres]] and red lake ([[carmine]] or [[madder lake]]) for his figures.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://colourlex.com/project/hieronymus-bosch/|title=Hieronymus Bosch: General Resources|work=ColourLex|access-date=8 March 2019}}</ref>[[File:The Garden of Earthly Delights by Bosch High Resolution.jpg|thumb|497x497px|''[[The Garden of Earthly Delights]]'' in the [[Museo del Prado]] in [[Madrid]], c. 1495\u20131505, attributed to Bosch.|alt=]]\n=== ''The Garden of Earthly Delights'' ===\n{{Main|The Garden of Earthly Delights}}\nBosch's most famous triptych is ''[[The Garden of Earthly Delights]]'' (c. 1495\u20131505) whose outer panels are intended to bracket the main central panel between the [[Garden of Eden]] depicted on the left panel and the [[Last Judgment]] depicted on the right panel. It is attributed by Fischer as a transition painting rendered by Bosch from between his middle period and his late period. In the left hand panel God presents [[Eve]] to [[Adam]]; innovatively God is given a youthful appearance. The figures are set in a landscape populated by exotic animals and unusual semi-organic hut-shaped forms. The central panel is a broad panorama teeming with nude figures engaged in innocent, self-absorbed joy, as well as fantastical compound animals, oversized fruit, and hybrid stone formations.<ref>Fraenger, 10</ref>\n\nThe right panel presents a hellscape; a world in which humankind has succumbed to the temptations of evil and is reaping eternal damnation. Set at night, the panel features cold colours, tortured figures and frozen waterways. The nakedness of the human figures has lost any eroticism suggested in the central panel,<ref>Belting, 38</ref> as large explosions in the background throw light through the city gate and spill onto the water in the panel's midground.<ref>Gibson, 92</ref>\n\n[[File:Hieronymus Bosch - The Garden of Earthly Delights - Hell.jpg|thumb|200px|Hell panel from ''[[The Garden of Earthly Delights]]''. It is alleged that Bosch's self-portrait is in the upper centre at right under the \"table\".]]\n\n== Interpretation ==\nIn the 20th century, when changing artistic tastes made artists like Bosch more palatable to the European imagination, it was sometimes argued that Bosch's art was inspired by heretical points of view (e.g., the ideas of the [[Cathars]] and/or putative [[Adamites]] or [[Brethren of the Free Spirit]])<ref>''The Millenium of Hieronymus Bosch. Outlines of a New Interpretation''. [[Wilhelm Fraenger]], University of Chicago Press, Chicago, 1951</ref> as well as by obscure hermetic practices. Again, since [[Erasmus]] had been educated at one of the houses of the [[Brethren of the Common Life]] in 's-Hertogenbosch, and the town was religiously progressive, some writers have found it unsurprising that strong parallels exist between the caustic writing of Erasmus and the often bold painting of Bosch.<ref>''The Secret Life of Paintings''. Richard Foster & Pamela Tudor-Craig {{ISBN|0-85115-439-5}}</ref>\n\nOthers, following a strain of Bosch-interpretation datable already to the 16th century, continued to think his work was created merely to titillate and amuse, much like the \"[[grotesque|grotteschi]]\" of the [[Italian Renaissance]]. While the art of the older masters was based in the physical world of everyday experience, Bosch confronts his viewer with, in the words of the art historian Walter Gibson, \"a world of dreams [and] nightmares in which forms seem to flicker and change before our eyes\". In one of the first known accounts of Bosch's paintings, in 1560 the Spaniard [[Felipe de Guevara]] wrote that Bosch was regarded merely as \"the inventor of [[monster]]s and [[Chimera (mythology)|chimeras]]\". In the early 17th century, the artist-biographer [[Karel van Mander]] described Bosch's work as comprising \"wondrous and strange fantasies\"; however, he concluded that the paintings are \"often less pleasant than gruesome to look at\".<ref>Gibson, 9</ref>\n\nIn recent decades, scholars have come to view Bosch's vision as less fantastic, and accepted that his art reflects the orthodox religious belief systems of his age.<ref name=Bosing>{{cite book|last1=Bosing|first1=Walter|title=Hieronymus Bosch|date=1987|publisher=Taschen}}</ref> His depictions of sinful humanity and his conceptions of Heaven and Hell are now seen as consistent with those of late medieval [[didactic]] literature and sermons. Most writers attach a more profound significance to his paintings than had previously been supposed, and attempt to interpret them in terms of a late medieval morality. It is generally accepted that Bosch's art was created to teach specific moral and spiritual truths in the manner of other [[Northern Renaissance]] figures, such as the poet [[Robert Henryson]], and that the images rendered have precise and premeditated significance. According to Dirk Bax, Bosch's paintings often represent visual translations of verbal metaphors and puns drawn from both biblical and folkloric sources.<ref>Bax, 1949.</ref> However, the conflict of interpretations that his works still elicit raises profound questions about the nature of \"ambiguity\" in art of his period.{{Citation needed|date=August 2019}}\n\nLatterly art historians have added a further dimension to the subject of ambiguity in Bosch's work, emphasising ironic tendencies, for example in ''[[The Garden of Earthly Delights]]'', both in the central panel (delights),<ref>Pokorny (2010), 23, 25, 31.</ref> and the right panel (hell).<ref>Boulboull\u00e9 (2008), 68, 70\u201372, 75\u201376.</ref> They theorise that the irony offers the option of detachment, both from the real world and from the painted fantasy world, thus appealing to both conservative and progressive viewers.{{citation needed|date=March 2019}}\n\nA 2012 study<ref>Oliveira, Paulo Martins, ''Jheronimus Bosch'', 2012, pp.27, 199\u2013218. {{ISBN|978-1-4791-6765-4}}.</ref> on Bosch's paintings alleges that they actually conceal a strong nationalist consciousness, censuring the foreign imperial government of the [[Burgundian Netherlands]], especially [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor|Maximilian Habsburg]]. By systematically superimposing images and concepts, the study asserts that Bosch also made his expiatory self-punishment, for he was accepting well-paid commissions from the Habsburgs and their deputies, and therefore betraying the memory of [[Charles the Bold]].<ref>Oliveira, Paulo Martins, ''Bosch, the surdo canis'', 2013 (on-line paper).</ref>\n\n==Debates on attribution==\n\n[[File:Bosch follower Christ Before Pilate (Princeton).jpg|thumb|''Christ Before Pilate'', ca. 1520, one of the paintings with disputed attribution, in the [[Princeton University Art Museum]] which would date from Bosch's Late period of painting.]]\n\nThe exact number of Bosch's surviving works has been a subject of considerable debate. His signature can be seen on only seven of his surviving paintings, and there is uncertainty whether all the paintings once ascribed to him were actually from his hand. It is known that from the early 16th century onwards numerous copies and variations of his paintings began to circulate. In addition, his style was highly influential, and was widely imitated by his numerous followers.<ref>Gibson, 163</ref>\n\nOver the years, scholars have attributed to him fewer and fewer of the works once thought to be his. This is partly a result of technological advances such as [[infrared|infrared reflectography]], which enable researchers to examine a painting's underdrawing.<ref>Finaldi, Gabriele/ Garrido, Carmen \"El trazo oculto.

Variants on his name are Jeronimus van Aken (Dijck (2000): pp. 173, 186), Jheronimus anthonissen van aken (Marijnissen ([1987]): p. 12), Jeronimus Van aeken (Marijnissen ([1987]): p. 13), Joen (Dijck (2000): pp. 170\u2013171, 174\u2013177), and Jeroen (Dijck (2000): pp. 170, 174).</ref> {{IPA-nl|je\u02d0\u02c8ro\u02d0nim\u028fs f\u0251n \u02c8a\u02d0k\u0259(n)|}};{{efn|In isolation, ''van'' is pronounced {{IPA-nl|v\u0251n||Nl-van.ogg}}.}} {{circa|1450}}&nbsp;\u2013 9 August 1516) was a [[Dutch people|Dutch]]/[[Netherlandish]] [[painter]] from [[Duchy of Brabant|Brabant]]. He is one of the most notable representatives of the [[Early Netherlandish painting]] school. His work contains fantastic illustrations of religious concepts and narratives.<ref>Catherine B. Scallen, ''The Art of the Northern Renaissance'' (Chantilly: The Teaching Company, 2007) Lecture 26</ref> Within his lifetime his work was collected in the Netherlands, Austria, and Spain, and widely copied, especially his macabre and nightmarish depictions of [[hell]].\n\nLittle is known of Bosch's life, though there are some records.  He spent most of it in the town of [['s-Hertogenbosch]], where he was born in his grandfather's house. The roots of his forefathers are in [[Nijmegen]] and [[Aachen]] (which is visible in his surname: Van Aken). His pessimistic and fantastical style cast a wide influence on northern art of the 16th century, with [[Pieter Bruegel the Elder]] being his best-known follower. Today he is seen as a hugely individualistic painter with deep insight into humanity's desires and deepest fears. Attribution has been especially difficult; today only about 25 paintings are confidently given to his hand<ref name=Siegal1Feb/> along with eight drawings. About another half dozen paintings are confidently attributed to his workshop. His most acclaimed works consist of a few [[triptych]] altarpieces, including ''[[The Garden of Earthly Delights]]''.\n\n==Life==\nHieronymus Bosch was born Jheronimus (or Joen,<ref>Dijck (2000): pp. 43\u201344. A variant on his Middle Dutch name is \"Jeroen\". Van Dijck points out that in all contemporary sources the name \"Jeroen\" is used twice, while the name \"Joen\" is used nine times, making \"Joen\" to be his probable Christian name.</ref> respectively the Latin and [[Middle Dutch]] form of the name \"Jerome\") van Aken (meaning \"from [[Aachen]]\"). He signed a number of his paintings as ''Jheronimus Bosch''.<ref>Signed works by Bosch include ''[[The Epiphany (Bosch)|The Adoration of the Magi]]'', ''[[Saint Christopher Carrying the Christ Child]]'', ''[[St. John the Evangelist on Patmos]]'', ''[[The Temptation of St Anthony (Bosch painting)|The Temptation of Saint Anthony]]'', ''[[The Hermit Saint|The Hermit Saints Triptych]]'', and ''[[The Crucifixion of St Julia]]''.</ref> The name derives from his birthplace, {{nowrap|[['s-Hertogenbosch]]}}, which is commonly called \"Den Bosch\" ('the forest').{{Citation needed|date=August 2019}}\n\nLittle is known of Bosch's life or training. He left behind no letters or diaries, and what has been identified has been taken from brief references to him in the municipal records of {{nowrap|'s-Hertogenbosch}}, and in the account books of the local order of the [[Illustrious Brotherhood of Our Blessed Lady]]. Nothing is known of his personality or his thoughts on the meaning of his art. Bosch's date of birth has not been determined with certainty. It is estimated at {{nowrap|{{circa}} 1450}} on the basis of a hand drawn portrait (which may be a self-portrait) made shortly before his death in 1516. The drawing shows the artist at an advanced age, probably in his late sixties.<ref>Gibson, 15\u201316</ref>\n\nBosch was born and lived all his life in and near {{nowrap|[['s-Hertogenbosch]]}}, a city in the [[Duchy of Brabant]]. His grandfather Jan van Aken (died 1454) was a painter and is first mentioned in the records in 1430. It is known that Jan had five sons, four of whom were also painters. Bosch's father, Anthonius van Aken (died {{circa}} 1478), acted as artistic adviser to the [[Illustrious Brotherhood of Our Blessed Lady]].<ref>Gibson, 15, 17</ref> It is generally assumed that either Bosch's father or one of his uncles taught the artist to paint, but none of their works survive.<ref>Gibson, 19</ref> Bosch first appears in the municipal record on 5 April 1474, when he is named along with two brothers and a sister.{{Citation needed|date=August 2019}}\n\n's-Hertogenbosch was a flourishing city in 15th-century [[Duchy of Brabant|Brabant]], in the south of the present-day Netherlands, at the time part of the [[Burgundian Netherlands]], and during its lifetime passing through marriage to the [[House of Habsburg|Habsburgs]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2019}} In 1463, four thousand houses in the town were destroyed by a catastrophic fire, which the then (approximately) thirteen-year-old Bosch presumably witnessed. He became a popular painter in his lifetime and often received commissions from abroad.{{Citation needed|date=August 2019}} In 1488 he joined the highly respected Brotherhood of Our Lady, a devotional confraternity of some forty influential citizens of {{nowrap|'s-Hertogenbosch}}, and seven thousand 'outer-members' from around Europe.{{Citation needed|date=August 2019}}\n\nSometime between 1479 and 1481, Bosch married Aleyt Goyaerts van den Meerveen, who was a few years his senior. The couple moved to the nearby town of Oirschot, where his wife had inherited a house and land from her wealthy family.<ref>Valery, Paul. ''The Phase of Doubt, A Critical Reflection''.</ref> An entry in the accounts of the Brotherhood of Our Lady records Bosch's death in 1516.

According to Stefan Fischer, thirteen of Bosch's surviving paintings were completed in the late period, with seven attributed to his middle period.<ref>Stefan Fischer. ''Bosch: The Complete Works.''</ref> Bosch's early period is studied in terms of his workshop activity and possibly some of his drawings. Indeed, he taught pupils in the workshop, who were influenced by him. The recent [[dendrochronological]] investigation of the oak panels by the scientists at the Bosch Research and Conservation Project<ref>[http://boschproject.org/ Bosch Research and Conservation Project], 2016</ref> led to a more precise dating of the majority of Bosch's paintings.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Luuk Hoogstede|author2=Ron Spronk|author3=Matthijs Ilsink| author4=Robert G.

About twenty five paintings remain today that can be attributed to him. In the late 16th century, [[Philip II of Spain]] acquired many of Bosch's paintings; as a result, the [[Museo del Prado|Prado Museum]] in [[Madrid]] now owns ''[[Adoration of the Magi (Bosch, Madrid)|The Adoration of the Magi]]'', ''[[The Garden of Earthly Delights]]'', the tabletop painting of ''[[The Seven Deadly Sins and the Four Last Things]]'' and ''[[The Haywain Triptych]]''.{{Citation needed|date=August 2019}}\n\n===Painting materials===\nBosch painted his works mostly on oak panels using oil as a medium. Bosch's palette was rather limited and contained the usual pigments of his time.<ref>Hoogstede et al.

It is attributed by Fischer as a transition painting rendered by Bosch from between his middle period and his late period. In the left hand panel God presents [[Eve]] to [[Adam]]; innovatively God is given a youthful appearance. The figures are set in a landscape populated by exotic animals and unusual semi-organic hut-shaped forms. The central panel is a broad panorama teeming with nude figures engaged in innocent, self-absorbed joy, as well as fantastical compound animals, oversized fruit, and hybrid stone formations.<ref>Fraenger, 10</ref>\n\nThe right panel presents a hellscape; a world in which humankind has succumbed to the temptations of evil and is reaping eternal damnation. Set at night, the panel features cold colours, tortured figures and frozen waterways. The nakedness of the human figures has lost any eroticism suggested in the central panel,<ref>Belting, 38</ref> as large explosions in the background throw light through the city gate and spill onto the water in the panel's midground.<ref>Gibson, 92</ref>\n\n[[File:Hieronymus Bosch - The Garden of Earthly Delights - Hell.jpg|thumb|200px|Hell panel from ''[[The Garden of Earthly Delights]]''. It is alleged that Bosch's self-portrait is in the upper centre at right under the \"table\".]]\n\n== Interpretation ==\nIn the 20th century, when changing artistic tastes made artists like Bosch more palatable to the European imagination, it was sometimes argued that Bosch's art was inspired by heretical points of view (e.g., the ideas of the [[Cathars]] and/or putative [[Adamites]] or [[Brethren of the Free Spirit]])<ref>''The Millenium of Hieronymus Bosch. Outlines of a New Interpretation''. [[Wilhelm Fraenger]], University of Chicago Press, Chicago, 1951</ref> as well as by obscure hermetic practices. Again, since [[Erasmus]] had been educated at one of the houses of the [[Brethren of the Common Life]] in 's-Hertogenbosch, and the town was religiously progressive, some writers have found it unsurprising that strong parallels exist between the caustic writing of Erasmus and the often bold painting of Bosch.<ref>''The Secret Life of Paintings''. Richard Foster & Pamela Tudor-Craig {{ISBN|0-85115-439-5}}</ref>\n\nOthers, following a strain of Bosch-interpretation datable already to the 16th century, continued to think his work was created merely to titillate and amuse, much like the \"[[grotesque|grotteschi]]\" of the [[Italian Renaissance]]. While the art of the older masters was based in the physical world of everyday experience, Bosch confronts his viewer with, in the words of the art historian Walter Gibson, \"a world of dreams [and] nightmares in which forms seem to flicker and change before our eyes\". In one of the first known accounts of Bosch's paintings, in 1560 the Spaniard [[Felipe de Guevara]] wrote that Bosch was regarded merely as \"the inventor of [[monster]]s and [[Chimera (mythology)|chimeras]]\". In the early 17th century, the artist-biographer [[Karel van Mander]] described Bosch's work as comprising \"wondrous and strange fantasies\"; however, he concluded that the paintings are \"often less pleasant than gruesome to look at\".<ref>Gibson, 9</ref>\n\nIn recent decades, scholars have come to view Bosch's vision as less fantastic, and accepted that his art reflects the orthodox religious belief systems of his age.<ref name=Bosing>{{cite book|last1=Bosing|first1=Walter|title=Hieronymus Bosch|date=1987|publisher=Taschen}}</ref> His depictions of sinful humanity and his conceptions of Heaven and Hell are now seen as consistent with those of late medieval [[didactic]] literature and sermons. Most writers attach a more profound significance to his paintings than had previously been supposed, and attempt to interpret them in terms of a late medieval morality. It is generally accepted that Bosch's art was created to teach specific moral and spiritual truths in the manner of other [[Northern Renaissance]] figures, such as the poet [[Robert Henryson]], and that the images rendered have precise and premeditated significance. According to Dirk Bax, Bosch's paintings often represent visual translations of verbal metaphors and puns drawn from both biblical and folkloric sources.<ref>Bax, 1949.</ref> However, the conflict of interpretations that his works still elicit raises profound questions about the nature of \"ambiguity\" in art of his period.{{Citation needed|date=August 2019}}\n\nLatterly art historians have added a further dimension to the subject of ambiguity in Bosch's work, emphasising ironic tendencies, for example in ''[[The Garden of Earthly Delights]]'', both in the central panel (delights),<ref>Pokorny (2010), 23, 25, 31.</ref> and the right panel (hell).<ref>Boulboull\u00e9 (2008), 68, 70\u201372, 75\u201376.</ref> They theorise that the irony offers the option of detachment, both from the real world and from the painted fantasy world, thus appealing to both conservative and progressive viewers.{{citation needed|date=March 2019}}\n\nA 2012 study<ref>Oliveira, Paulo Martins, ''Jheronimus Bosch'', 2012, pp.27, 199\u2013218. {{ISBN|978-1-4791-6765-4}}.</ref> on Bosch's paintings alleges that they actually conceal a strong nationalist consciousness, censuring the foreign imperial government of the [[Burgundian Netherlands]], especially [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor|Maximilian Habsburg]]. By systematically superimposing images and concepts, the study asserts that Bosch also made his expiatory self-punishment, for he was accepting well-paid commissions from the Habsburgs and their deputies, and therefore betraying the memory of [[Charles the Bold]].<ref>Oliveira, Paulo Martins, ''Bosch, the surdo canis'', 2013 (on-line paper).</ref>\n\n==Debates on attribution==\n\n[[File:Bosch follower Christ Before Pilate (Princeton).jpg|thumb|''Christ Before Pilate'', ca. 1520, one of the paintings with disputed attribution, in the [[Princeton University Art Museum]] which would date from Bosch's Late period of painting.]]\n\nThe exact number of Bosch's surviving works has been a subject of considerable debate. His signature can be seen on only seven of his surviving paintings, and there is uncertainty whether all the paintings once ascribed to him were actually from his hand. It is known that from the early 16th century onwards numerous copies and variations of his paintings began to circulate. In addition, his style was highly influential, and was widely imitated by his numerous followers.<ref>Gibson, 163</ref>\n\nOver the years, scholars have attributed to him fewer and fewer of the works once thought to be his. This is partly a result of technological advances such as [[infrared|infrared reflectography]], which enable researchers to examine a painting's underdrawing.<ref>Finaldi, Gabriele/ Garrido, Carmen \"El trazo oculto.
