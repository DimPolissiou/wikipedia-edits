It was purposely built as a family residence by the [[Maltese nobility]], and it is named after the Falson family. It is presently open to the public as a house-museum with seventeen rooms of historic domestic belongings and a number of antique collections.\n\nThe building is believed to have been built in around 1495, probably incorporating parts of a 13th-century building. This makes it the second oldest building in Mdina, after the ground floor of [[Palazzo Santa Sofia]]. During the rule of the [[Knights Hospitaller|Order of St. John]], the building might have received [[Philippe Villiers de L'Isle-Adam]], the first Grand Master in Malta. The building was further enlarged in the mid-16th century. Its architect is unknown, but the distinctive upper floor windows might be the work of Jacobo Dimeg.\n\nPalazzo Falson was acquired by Olof Frederick Gollcher in the 20th century, and he restored and altered parts of the building. It is now owned by a foundation established by Gollcher, and since 2007 it has been open to the public as the '''Palazzo Falson Historic House Museum''', which is managed by the ''[[Fondazzjoni Patrimonju Malti]]'', a Maltese heritage foundation. It displays permanent collections which originally belonged to Gollcher, and occasionally other temporary exhibits from private collections.\n\nThe building was included on the Antiquities List of 1925, it has been a Grade 1 scheduled property since 1992, and is on the list of the [[National Inventory of the Cultural Property of the Maltese Islands]].\n\n==History==\nThe Falsone{{efn|Various spellings of the surname now known as [[Falzon]] were used over the centuries, including Falczono, Falczun, Falczuni, Falson, Falsone, Falsono, Falsuni, Falzono, Falzuni, Fanchuni, Fauzon, Fauzoni and Fauzuni.<ref name=\"storja2004\"/>}} family was one of the prominent families of medieval Mdina, and its members were often involved in the city's municipal affairs.

L'Isle-Adam's visit to the Falsone residence in Mdina is documented by [[Giovanni Francesco Abela]] in his 1647 book ''Della Descrittione di Malta'', and until recently, the residence in question was assumed to be Palazzo Falson. However, there is some uncertainty as who owned the palace at the time. Documents suggest that the building originally belonged to the Cumbo family, and that the main branch of the Falsone family never owned the palace.<ref name=\"melitensiawth\"/> On the other hand, some sources claim that in the 16th century the building was owned by Ambrosio de Falsone, Head of the Town Council, and in 1524 it was inherited by his cousin, Vice-Admiral Michele Falsone.<ref name=\"museumhistory\"/> The latter is said to have made further changes to the building including the addition of mullioned windows on the second floor.<ref name= \"Vella2013\" /> These windows are sometimes known in Italian and Maltese architecture as [[Bifora (architecture)|bifora]].<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://books.google.com/?id=ow9NAQAAMAAJ&dq=Windows+of+Mdina&q=Window |title = MDINA: Architectural and Urban Transformations of a Citadel in Malta|last1 = Thake|first1 = Conrad Gerald|year = 1996}}</ref> The decorative windows were probably designed by the local architect Jacobo Dimeg (1464-1527).<ref name=\"galeaandbalzan\"/><ref name=\"storja2004\">{{cite journal|journal=Storja|first=Godfrey|last=Wettinger|date=2004|title=The Falzon Family and the Capomastro of its House at Mdina|url=http://melitensiawth.com/incoming/Index/Storja/Storja2003-2004/03s.pdf|volume=|issue=|page=30}}</ref> The palace's ''piano nobile'' is believed to have been added in the mid-16th century.<ref name=\"melitensiawth\"/>\n\nThe building eventually passed to Matteo Falson, who was the [[Castellan|Master of the Rod]].

She passed the building to her nephew Federico Falsone, who was not a member of the main branch of the family and who probably never lived at the palace. The building eventually passed into the hands of the Muscati-Falsone-Navarra family, and by the 1920s it belonged to Count Francesco Palermo Navarra Bonici, a resident of [[Catania]].<ref name=melitensiawth>{{cite journal|last1=Busuttil|first1=Claude|title=A Double Act for the 'Norman House': Palazzo Falzon or Palazzo Cumbo-Navarra?|journal=Melita Historica|date=1999|volume=12|issue=4|pages=411\u2013418|url=http://melitensiawth.com/incoming/Index/Melita%20Historica/MH.12(1996-99)/MH.12(1999)4/08.pdf|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160118221115/http://melitensiawth.com/incoming/Index/Melita%20Historica/MH.12(1996-99)/MH.12(1999)4/08.pdf|archivedate=18 January 2016}}</ref> Throughout the centuries a number of changes were made to the house, including a reduction in the size of the building by separating it into more than one tenement.<ref name=\"galeaandbalzan\"/>\n\nIn 1927, Olof Gollcher and his mother purchased part of the palace from Count Navarra Bonici for \u00a3680, and he later bought the remaining part of the palace in 1938 for \u00a3550.<ref name=\"Page9\">Galea; Balzan (2007) p. 9.</ref> Gollcher was an art collector, and he transferred his collections into the palace, which he called ''The Norman House'' since at the time its architectural features were considered to be [[Siculo-Norman]].<ref name=\"museumhistory\"/> In 1929, the palace's fa\u00e7ade was restored, but it was also modified in the process.

They include a Kitchen, an Armoury, a Carpet Gallery, as well as Capt. Gollcher\u2019s Library, Studio and Study.\n\nOne of the rarest items in the museum, is the 10-hour [[French Revolution]]-era time piece. This watch is one of only three such watches that are known to survive by the maker Robert Robin (1742-1799). It is numbered the 2nd in the series.<ref name=\"Thompson2015\">{{cite book|last=Thompson|first=David|date=2015|title=Watches: From Timekeepers to Trendsetters|publisher=Fondazzjoni Patrimonju Malti|page=}}</ref>{{page needed|date=February 2017}}  Robin had been [[King Louis XVI]]\u2019s (r.1774-1791) favourite watch maker, but at the introduction of the Revolution\u2019s Decimal time he produced this watch.<ref name=\"Thompson2015\" />{{page needed|date=February 2017}}\n\n[[File:Palazzo Falzon second entrance, from yard.jpg|thumb|left|Secondary entrance and exit]]\n\nOther items of particular note include the painting ''Portrait of a Boy'' attributed to the Spanish baroque artist [[Bartolom\u00e9 Esteban Murillo]] (1617-1682); four small pictures representing the ''Four Seasons'' traditionally attributed to the French painter [[Nicolas Poussin]] (1594-1665),<ref name=\"Page45\">Galea; Balzan (2007) pp. 45-49.</ref>  and a landscape ink and wash sketch by the British 19th century artist and poet [[Edward Lear]] (1812-1888) made during one of his stays in Malta.<ref name=\"Page81\">Galea; Balzan (2007) p. 81.</ref>  Engravings of importance include a series by Italian baroque artist [[Salvator Rosa]] (1615-1673).<ref name=\"Page39\">Galea; Balzan (2007) p. 39.</ref>\n\nThe collection is not just limited to paintings and the decorative arts, but he also collected typical household objects or items of unique historical interest. One of the more intriguing items is a [[chastity belt]], originally believed to have been worn during the Middle Ages as a sign of a woman\u2019s fidelity while her husband was away at war. Nowadays the chastity belt is commonly thought to be a [[Victorian era|Victorian]] fabrication, and an item of curiosity.<ref name=\"Page21\">Galea; Balzan (2007) p. 21.</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1= Vella|first1=Fiona|last2=Gatt|first2=Oliver|date=2018|title=Bizarre Malta: a look beyond the obvious|chapter=Under Lock and Key: The Palazzo Falson Chastity Belt, Mdina|chapter-url=https://www.bdlbooks.com/art-photography/6676-bizarre-malta.html|publisher=Book Distributors Limited|isbn=978-999577-333-5|pages=15\u201318}}</ref>\n\nThe museum also has some Maltese earthenware containers traditionally used to cook [[rabbit stew]]. They are known as ''\u2018Il-Baqra\u2019'' which translates to \u2018the cow\u2019 in Maltese and refers to the shape of the pot resembling that of a cow.<ref name=\"Page27\">Galea; Balzan (2007) p. 27.</ref>   These pots have today fallen out of use.\n\nGollcher had an extensive silverware collection, varying from decorative figurines to coffee pots and other tableware. Two large silver Nefs form part of the collection. A nef, or silver ship, would have been placed at the dinner table, not just as a decorative item but to contain and dispense salt, pepper and other spices down the table. At times, they were also used to hold napkins or cutlery.\n\n====The Library====\nOver his lifetime Capt. Gollcher amassed a collection of 4,500 books and manuscripts, presently still to be found in the library of the museum.<ref name=\"Page62\">Galea; Balzan (2007) p. 62.</ref> This impressive collection has been catalogued and the titles can be viewed on the website.

Gollcher\u2019s varied interest, in art history, biographies and the two world wars, to mention but a few. He also collected Melitensia books (ie. books about the Maltese Islands or written by Maltese authors or published in Malta) including [[Giacomo Bosio]]\u2019s 1594 ''Dell\u2019Istoria della Sacra Religione'' and its update by Bartolomeo Del Pozzo.<ref name=\"Page63\">Galea; Balzan (2007) p. 63.</ref>\n\n====Temporary Exhibitions ====\nPalazzo Falson regularly holds temporary exhibitions which highlight particular objects from Capt.

It was purposely built as a family residence by the [[Maltese nobility]], and it is named after the Falson family. It is presently open to the public as a house-museum with seventeen rooms of historic domestic belongings and a number of antique collections.\n\nThe building is believed to have been built in around 1495, probably incorporating parts of a 13th-century building. This makes it the second oldest building in Mdina, after the ground floor of [[Palazzo Santa Sofia]]. During the rule of the [[Knights Hospitaller|Order of St. John]], the building might have received [[Philippe Villiers de L'Isle-Adam]], the first Grand Master in Malta. The building was further enlarged in the mid-16th century. Its architect is unknown, but the distinctive upper floor windows might be the work of Jacobo Dimeg.\n\nPalazzo Falson was acquired by Olof Frederick Gollcher in the 20th century, and he restored and altered parts of the building. It is now owned by a foundation established by Gollcher, and since 2007 it has been open to the public as the '''Palazzo Falson Historic House Museum''', which is managed by the ''[[Fondazzjoni Patrimonju Malti]]'', a Maltese heritage foundation. It displays permanent collections which originally belonged to Gollcher, and occasionally other temporary exhibits from private collections.\n\nThe building was included on the Antiquities List of 1925, it has been a Grade 1 scheduled property since 1992, and is on the list of the [[National Inventory of the Cultural Property of the Maltese Islands]].\n\n==History==\nThe Falsone{{efn|Various spellings of the surname now known as [[Falzon]] were used over the centuries, including Falczono, Falczun, Falczuni, Falson, Falsone, Falsono, Falsuni, Falzono, Falzuni, Fanchuni, Fauzon, Fauzoni and Fauzuni.<ref name=\"storja2004\"/>}} family was one of the prominent families of medieval Mdina, and its members were often involved in the city's municipal affairs.

L'Isle-Adam's visit to the Falsone residence in Mdina is documented by [[Giovanni Francesco Abela]] in his 1647 book ''Della Descrittione di Malta'', and until recently, the residence in question was assumed to be Palazzo Falson. However, there is some uncertainty as who owned the palace at the time. Documents suggest that the building originally belonged to the Cumbo family, and that the main branch of the Falsone family never owned the palace.<ref name=\"melitensiawth\"/> On the other hand, some sources claim that in the 16th century the building was owned by Ambrosio de Falsone, Head of the Town Council, and in 1524 it was inherited by his cousin, Vice-Admiral Michele Falsone.<ref name=\"museumhistory\"/> The latter is said to have made further changes to the building including the addition of mullioned windows on the second floor.<ref name= \"Vella2013\" /> These windows are sometimes known in Italian and Maltese architecture as [[Bifora (architecture)|bifora]].<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://books.google.com/?id=ow9NAQAAMAAJ&dq=Windows+of+Mdina&q=Window |title = MDINA: Architectural and Urban Transformations of a Citadel in Malta|last1 = Thake|first1 = Conrad Gerald|year = 1996}}</ref> The decorative windows were probably designed by the local architect Jacobo Dimeg (1464-1527).<ref name=\"galeaandbalzan\"/><ref name=\"storja2004\">{{cite journal|journal=Storja|first=Godfrey|last=Wettinger|date=2004|title=The Falzon Family and the Capomastro of its House at Mdina|url=http://melitensiawth.com/incoming/Index/Storja/Storja2003-2004/03s.pdf|volume=|issue=|page=30}}</ref> The palace's ''piano nobile'' is believed to have been added in the mid-16th century.<ref name=\"melitensiawth\"/>\n\nThe building eventually passed to Matteo Falson, who was the [[Castellan|Master of the Rod]].

Gollcher\u2019s Library, Studio and Study.\n\nOne of the rarest items in the museum, is the 10-hour [[French Revolution]]-era time piece. This watch is one of only three such watches that are known to survive by the maker Robert Robin (1742-1799). It is numbered the 2nd in the series.<ref name=\"Thompson2015\">{{cite book|last=Thompson|first=David|date=2015|title=Watches: From Timekeepers to Trendsetters|publisher=Fondazzjoni Patrimonju Malti|page=}}</ref>{{page needed|date=February 2017}}  Robin had been [[King Louis XVI]]\u2019s (r.1774-1791) favourite watch maker, but at the introduction of the Revolution\u2019s Decimal time he produced this watch.<ref name=\"Thompson2015\" />{{page needed|date=February 2017}}\n\n[[File:Palazzo Falzon second entrance, from yard.jpg|thumb|left|Secondary entrance and exit]]\n\nOther items of particular note include the painting ''Portrait of a Boy'' attributed to the Spanish baroque artist [[Bartolom\u00e9 Esteban Murillo]] (1617-1682); four small pictures representing the ''Four Seasons'' traditionally attributed to the French painter [[Nicolas Poussin]] (1594-1665),<ref name=\"Page45\">Galea; Balzan (2007) pp. 45-49.</ref>  and a landscape ink and wash sketch by the British 19th century artist and poet [[Edward Lear]] (1812-1888) made during one of his stays in Malta.<ref name=\"Page81\">Galea; Balzan (2007) p. 81.</ref>  Engravings of importance include a series by Italian baroque artist [[Salvator Rosa]] (1615-1673).<ref name=\"Page39\">Galea; Balzan (2007) p. 39.</ref>\n\nThe collection is not just limited to paintings and the decorative arts, but he also collected typical household objects or items of unique historical interest. One of the more intriguing items is a [[chastity belt]], originally believed to have been worn during the Middle Ages as a sign of a woman\u2019s fidelity while her husband was away at war.

Two large silver Nefs form part of the collection. A nef, or silver ship, would have been placed at the dinner table, not just as a decorative item but to contain and dispense salt, pepper and other spices down the table. At times, they were also used to hold napkins or cutlery.\n\n====The Library====\nOver his lifetime Capt. Gollcher amassed a collection of 4,500 books and manuscripts, presently still to be found in the library of the museum.<ref name=\"Page62\">Galea; Balzan (2007) p. 62.</ref> This impressive collection has been catalogued and the titles can be viewed on the website.

Gollcher\u2019s varied interest, in art history, biographies and the two world wars, to mention but a few. He also collected Melitensia books (ie. books about the Maltese Islands or written by Maltese authors or published in Malta) including [[Giacomo Bosio]]\u2019s 1594 ''Dell\u2019Istoria della Sacra Religione'' and its update by Bartolomeo Del Pozzo.<ref name=\"Page63\">Galea; Balzan (2007) p. 63.</ref>\n\n====Temporary Exhibitions ====\nPalazzo Falson regularly holds temporary exhibitions which highlight particular objects from Capt.

And we kept going through bigger and bigger feature lists of what we needed to do to upgrade it, and who could possibly do the work, and it was getting really, really unwieldy. And there was this massive meeting to try and sort it out, and try to cut things and decide what to keep, and plan and...there was this point where I looked at that and said 'you know, everything you're proposing to add to UnrealScript is already in C++.

And what we needed to do to make it competitive in the future. And we kept going through bigger and bigger feature lists of what we needed to do to upgrade it, and who could possibly do the work, and it was getting really, really unwieldy. And there was this massive meeting to try and sort it out, and try to cut things and decide what to keep, and plan and...there was this point where I looked at that and said 'you know, everything you're proposing to add to UnrealScript is already in C++. Why don't we just kill UnrealScript and move to pure C++? You know, maximum performance and maximum debuggability.

And when I play live, I can't replicate these things, I haven't got all the other musicians.\" Sheeran said he wanted an R&B feel to the song, therefore he adjusted the original tune, adding an interpolation of \"[[No Scrubs]]\" onto part of the melody. He also revealed that the original lyrics did not end with the words \"the shape of you\" in the chorus, but during the writing of the song,  McDaid thought that the lyrics \"I'm in love with your body\" sounded objectifying, and the lyrics was therefore adjusted.<ref name=\"nytimes\">{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/video/arts/music/100000005469604/ed-sheeran-shape-of-you.html |title='Shape of You': Making 2017's Biggest Track |author=Taylor Beldy |author2=Alicia Desantis |author3=Alexandra Eaton |author4=Evan Grothjan |author5=Graham Rober |newspaper=The New York Times }}</ref><ref name=\"braca\"/>\n\nOn 4 January 2017, Sheeran uploaded a six-second teaser video of a blue background to social media, with lyrics \"the club isn't the best place to find a lover\", which is the first line of \"Shape of You\".

Its range extends from central Argentina in the south to the US-Mexico border in the north, through Central and South America east of the [[Andes]]. The jaguarundi is a medium-sized cat of slender build and uniform coloration that differs significantly from other [[Neotropics|neotropical]] cats (such as the small, spotted cats in the [[genus]] ''[[Leopardus]]'') in its external appearance. In fact, the jaguarundi shows several features seen in [[mustelid]]s (such as [[otter]]s and [[weasel]]s)\u2014it has an elongated body with relatively short legs, a small, narrow head, small, round ears, a short [[snout]] and a long tail. Around twice as large as the [[domestic cat]], the jaguarundi reaches nearly {{convert|14|in|cm|abbr=on|order=flip}} at the shoulder and weighs {{convert|3.5|\u2013|7|kg|lb|abbr=on}}. There are two color [[Morph (zoology)|morph]]s\u2014gray and red.\n\nSecretive and alert, the jaguarundi is typically solitary or forms pairs in the wild, though captive individuals are gregarious. Unlike other [[Sympatry|sympatric]] cats such as [[ocelot]]s, the jaguarundi is more active during the day and hunts mainly during daytime and evening hours. Individuals live in large [[home range]]s, and are sparsely distributed within a region. The jaguarundi is an efficient climber, but typically prefers hunting on ground. It feeds on various kinds of prey, especially ground-feeding birds, reptiles, [[rodent]]s and small mammals. Mating occurs throughout the year, with peaks at different times of the year across the range. After a [[gestation period]] of 70 to 75 days, a litter of one to four kittens is born. Lifespan of up to 15 years has been recorded in captivity.\n\nJaguarundis occur in a broad array of closed as well as open habitats ranging from tropical rainforests and [[deciduous forest]]s to deserts and [[thorn scrub]]s. While they are fairly common in Brazil, Peru and Venezuela, jaguarundis may have gone [[extinct]] in the US. The [[IUCN]] lists the jaguarundi as [[Least Concern]], but populations are in decline in many parts of its range due to loss and [[Habitat fragmentation|fragmentation]] of their habitat and persecution for killing poultry.\n\n==Etymology==\nThe common name \"jaguarundi\" ({{IPAc-en|\u02cc|\u0292|\u00e6|\u0261|w|\u0259|\u02c8|r|\u028c|n|d|i}}) comes from the [[Guarani language|Old Guarani]] word ''yaguarundi'', similar to the [[Old Tupi]] word ''yawaum'di''.<ref>{{cite book |last=Ferreira |first=A.B.H. |year=1986 |title=Novo Dicion\u00e1rio da L\u00edngua Portuguesa|language=Portuguese |trans-title=New Dictionary of the Portuguese Language |edition=2nd|place=Rio de Janeiro |publisher=Nova Fronteira |page=980}}</ref><ref>{{Cite Merriam-Webster|jaguarundi|accessdate=10 April 2020}}</ref> In some [[Spanish language|Spanish]]-speaking countries, the jaguarundi is also called ''gato colorado'', ''gato moro'', ''le\u00f3n brenero'', ''leoncillo'' and ''tigrillo''.<ref name=iucn/> It is also called ''eyra'', ''gato-mourisco'', ''gato-preto'', ''gato-vermelho'' and ''maracaj\u00e1-preto'' in [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=de Miranda |first1=E.E. |last2=Gambarini |first2=A. |title=Natureza, Conserva\u00e7\u00e3o e Cultura: Ensaio sobre a Rela\u00e7\u00e3o do Homem com a Natureza no Brasil |trans-title=Nature, Conservation and Culture: Essay on the Relationship between Man and Nature in Brazil |date=2003 |publisher=Metalivros |location=S\u00e3o Paulo |isbn=9788585371470 |page=113 |language=Portuguese}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |editor1-last=Nowell |editor1-first=K. |editor2-last=Jackson |editor2-first=P. |editor3-last=IUCN/SSC Cat Specialist Group |title=Wild Cats: Status Survey and Conservation Action Plan |date=1996 |publisher=IUCN |location=Gland |isbn=978-2-8317-0045-8 |page=146}}</ref>\n\n==Taxonomy==\n''Felis yagouarundi'' was the [[scientific name]] used by [[\u00c9tienne Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire]] in 1803 who described two [[zoological specimen|specimen]]s from Central America, including one from [[French Guiana]].<ref>{{cite book |author=Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire, \u00c9. |authorlink=\u00c9tienne Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire |year=1803 |title=Catalogue des Mammif\u00e8res du Museum National d'Histoire Naturelle |trans-title=Catalogue of Mammals of the National Museum of Natural History| language=French |location=Paris |publisher=Museum National d'Histoire Naturelle |page=124 |chapter=Le chat yagouarundi.

The jaguarundi has a broad vocal repertoire; 13 different calls have been recorded including chattering, purring, screaming, a 'wah-wah' call, whistling, yapping and a peculiar bird-like chirp.

Estrus lasts three to five days, marked by the female regularly rolling onto her back and [[spraying urine]]. [[Sexually mature]] males will pursue the female, not reacting to any aggressive behavior from her side. As in many other felids, the male bites the fur on the female's neck on mounting; the female lets out a loud scream on penetration.<ref name=WCoW/><ref name=ms/>\n\nAfter a [[gestation]] period of 70 to 75 days, a litter of one to four kittens is born in a den constructed in a dense thicket, hollow tree, or similar cover. The kittens are covered well with fur and the underside is marked with spots, which disappear as they age; the coat color gradually changes as the kittens grow older.<ref name=WCoW/><ref name=ceballos/> The mother starts bringing solid food for the kittens when they are around three weeks old, who simply play with it till the mother ingests it; kittens are capable of taking solid food like birds and guinea pigs at around six weeks. Jaguarundis become sexually mature at one to three years of age. Lifespan up to 15 years has been recorded in captivity.<ref name=WCoW/><ref name=Nowak/>\n\n==Distribution and habitat==\nThe jaguarundi inhabits a wide variety of habitats\u2014from tropical rainforests and [[deciduous forest]]s to deserts and [[thorn scrub]]s.

[[felidae|cat]] native to the Americas. Its range extends from central Argentina in the south to the US-Mexico border in the north, through Central and South America east of the [[Andes]]. The jaguarundi is a medium-sized cat of slender build and uniform coloration that differs significantly from other [[Neotropics|neotropical]] cats (such as the small, spotted cats in the [[genus]] ''[[Leopardus]]'') in its external appearance. In fact, the jaguarundi shows several features seen in [[mustelid]]s (such as [[otter]]s and [[weasel]]s)\u2014it has an elongated body with relatively short legs, a small, narrow head, small, round ears, a short [[snout]] and a long tail. Around twice as large as the [[domestic cat]], the jaguarundi reaches nearly {{convert|14|in|cm|abbr=on|order=flip}} at the shoulder and weighs {{convert|3.5|\u2013|7|kg|lb|abbr=on}}. There are two color [[Morph (zoology)|morph]]s\u2014gray and red.\n\nSecretive and alert, the jaguarundi is typically solitary or forms pairs in the wild, though captive individuals are gregarious. Unlike other [[Sympatry|sympatric]] cats such as [[ocelot]]s, the jaguarundi is more active during the day and hunts mainly during daytime and evening hours. Individuals live in large [[home range]]s, and are sparsely distributed within a region. The jaguarundi is an efficient climber, but typically prefers hunting on ground. It feeds on various kinds of prey, especially ground-feeding birds, reptiles, [[rodent]]s and small mammals. Mating occurs throughout the year, with peaks at different times of the year across the range. After a [[gestation period]] of 70 to 75 days, a litter of one to four kittens is born. Lifespan of up to 15 years has been recorded in captivity.\n\nJaguarundis occur in a broad array of closed as well as open habitats ranging from tropical rainforests and [[deciduous forest]]s to deserts and [[thorn scrub]]s. While they are fairly common in Brazil, Peru and Venezuela, jaguarundis may have gone [[extinct]] in the US. The [[IUCN]] lists the jaguarundi as [[Least Concern]], but populations are in decline in many parts of its range due to loss and [[Habitat fragmentation|fragmentation]] of their habitat and persecution for killing poultry.\n\n==Etymology==\nThe common name \"jaguarundi\" ({{IPAc-en|\u02cc|\u0292|\u00e6|\u0261|w|\u0259|\u02c8|r|\u028c|n|d|i}}) comes from the [[Guarani language|Old Guarani]] word ''yaguarundi'', similar to the [[Old Tupi]] word ''yawaum'di''.<ref>{{cite book |last=Ferreira |first=A.B.H. |year=1986 |title=Novo Dicion\u00e1rio da L\u00edngua Portuguesa|language=Portuguese |trans-title=New Dictionary of the Portuguese Language |edition=2nd|place=Rio de Janeiro |publisher=Nova Fronteira |page=980}}</ref><ref>{{Cite Merriam-Webster|jaguarundi|accessdate=10 April 2020}}</ref> In some [[Spanish language|Spanish]]-speaking countries, the jaguarundi is also called ''gato colorado'', ''gato moro'', ''le\u00f3n brenero'', ''leoncillo'' and ''tigrillo''.<ref name=iucn/> It is also called ''eyra'', ''gato-mourisco'', ''gato-preto'', ''gato-vermelho'' and ''maracaj\u00e1-preto'' in [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=de Miranda |first1=E.E. |last2=Gambarini |first2=A. |title=Natureza, Conserva\u00e7\u00e3o e Cultura: Ensaio sobre a Rela\u00e7\u00e3o do Homem com a Natureza no Brasil |trans-title=Nature, Conservation and Culture: Essay on the Relationship between Man and Nature in Brazil |date=2003 |publisher=Metalivros |location=S\u00e3o Paulo |isbn=9788585371470 |page=113 |language=Portuguese}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |editor1-last=Nowell |editor1-first=K. |editor2-last=Jackson |editor2-first=P. |editor3-last=IUCN/SSC Cat Specialist Group |title=Wild Cats: Status Survey and Conservation Action Plan |date=1996 |publisher=IUCN |location=Gland |isbn=978-2-8317-0045-8 |page=146}}</ref>\n\n==Taxonomy==\n''Felis yagouarundi'' was the [[scientific name]] used by [[\u00c9tienne Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire]] in 1803 who described two [[zoological specimen|specimen]]s from Central America, including one from [[French Guiana]].<ref>{{cite book |author=Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire, \u00c9. |authorlink=\u00c9tienne Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire |year=1803 |title=Catalogue des Mammif\u00e8res du Museum National d'Histoire Naturelle |trans-title=Catalogue of Mammals of the National Museum of Natural History| language=French |location=Paris |publisher=Museum National d'Histoire Naturelle |page=124 |chapter=Le chat yagouarundi.

The jaguarundi has a broad vocal repertoire; 13 different calls have been recorded including chattering, purring, screaming, a 'wah-wah' call, whistling, yapping and a peculiar bird-like chirp.

Estrus lasts three to five days, marked by the female regularly rolling onto her back and [[spraying urine]]. [[Sexually mature]] males will pursue the female, not reacting to any aggressive behavior from her side. As in many other felids, the male bites the fur on the female's neck on mounting; the female lets out a loud scream on penetration.<ref name=WCoW/><ref name=ms/>\n\nAfter a [[gestation]] period of 70 to 75 days, a litter of one to four kittens is born in a den constructed in a dense thicket, hollow tree, or similar cover. The kittens are covered well with fur and the underside is marked with spots, which disappear as they age; the coat color gradually changes as the kittens grow older.<ref name=WCoW/><ref name=ceballos/> The mother starts bringing solid food for the kittens when they are around three weeks old, who simply play with it till the mother ingests it; kittens are capable of taking solid food like birds and guinea pigs at around six weeks. Jaguarundis become sexually mature at one to three years of age. Lifespan up to 15 years has been recorded in captivity.<ref name=WCoW/><ref name=Nowak/>\n\n==Distribution and habitat==\nThe jaguarundi inhabits a wide variety of habitats\u2014from tropical rainforests and [[deciduous forest]]s to deserts and [[thorn scrub]]s.
