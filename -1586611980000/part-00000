{"title_page": "Nativity! (film)", "text_new": "Nativity! is a 2009 British Christmas comedy film directed by Debbie Isitt and released on 27 November 2009 and the first installment in the Nativity film series. The film stars Martin Freeman and Ashley Jensen. The film was written by its director, Debbie Isitt, but was also partially improvised.[2] The film premiered on 23 November 2009 in the SkyDome Arena, Coventry, England.[3]\n\nIt was released in cinemas on 27 November 2009. The film was followed by Nativity 2: Danger in the Manger (2012), Nativity 3: Dude, Where's My Donkey? (2014),[4] and Nativity Rocks! (2018).\nContents\n1\tPlot\n2\tCast\n3\tProduction\n4\tBox office\n5\tSequels\n6\tStage musical\n7\tReferences\n8\tExternal links\n\nPlot\nPaul Maddens is a teacher at St Bernadette's Catholic primary school in Coventry. Paul once had ambitions of being successful as an actor, producer or director. Every year St Bernadette's competes with Oakmoor, a local Protestant private school, to see who can produce the best nativity play.\n\nPaul hates Christmas because his girlfriend at drama school, Jennifer Lore, broke up with him at Christmas. The headteacher, Mrs Bevans, tasks him with running their nativity play this year, and gives him a new teaching assistant named Mr Poppy, who turns out to be more of a child than the students.\n\nPaul's rival from drama school, Gordon Shakespeare, runs the nativity plays at Oakmoor. Determined not to be seen as a failure, Paul lies to Shakespeare about how a Hollywood producer, Jennifer, will be turning his production into a Hollywood film (though he hasn't spoken to her in five years). Mr Poppy overhears this and is so excited that he spreads the story to the press. Paul finds his lie is out of control, and all he can do is go along with it as media attention mounts and the children get very excited.\n\nThe children are nowhere near as talented as the Oakmoor students, and Paul has little confidence in their abilities. The enthusiastic Mr. Poppy helps him and the class to create an energetic, interesting nativity which showcases all of the children's unique (and often strange) talents.\n\nPaul tries to contact Jennifer to make the lie come true, even travelling to America to persuade her to visit. It turns out that she is only the secretary to a film producer, and he returns home disappointed.\n\nAmid continuing media attention and the Mayor's kind offer to allow the play to be performed in the historical ruins of Coventry Cathedral, Mrs Bevans discovers that the Hollywood story was a lie and cancels the play, advising Paul to start looking for another job. Paul shouts at Mr Poppy about everything going wrong, but comes to his senses when facing his disappointed class and decides that the show must go on.\n\nThe play is performed at the cathedral to an audience of the children's parents and family friends. The production is amazingly good, to the surprise of everyone involved. Halfway through, Gordon climbs on stage to tell everybody that there is nobody from Hollywood there and the entire story was a lie. Luckily, a helicopter flies over and Mr Poppy declares that it's Hollywood arriving; the show continues, and Jennifer and her producer indeed appear at the back to watch. Paul joins them and, still in love, kisses Jennifer. The play ends with everyone, including Gordon and Mrs Bevans (who has a change of heart), reunited onstage to celebrate the children's success.\n\nAs the film closes, Paul and Jennifer are shown decorating his house together for Christmas, reunited at last.\nCast\nMartin Freeman as Paul Maddens, a primary school teacher trying to produce and direct a nativity play that will for once outdo a rival school.[1]\nMarc Wootton as Desmond Poppy, nephew of Mrs Bevan and immature classroom assistant.\nJason Watkins as Gordon Shakespeare, a private primary school teacher and long-time rival of Paul.[1]\nAshley Jensen as Jennifer Lore, formerly a Hollywood secretary and Paul's girlfriend at the end of the film.[1]\nAlan Carr as Patrick Burns, critic.[5]\nRicky Tomlinson as The Mayor.\nPam Ferris as Mrs Patricia Bevan, the headmistress of St. Bernadette's Primary School.\nClarke Peters as Mr Parker, a Hollywood director, Jennifer's boss during her time at Hollywood.\nGeoffrey Hutchings as Father Tom.\nRosie Cavaliero as Miss Rye.\nMr. Maddens' Class\tMr. Shakespeare's Class\nAlexandra Allen as Cleo\tAidofe McLeod as Grace\nBen Wilby as Bob\tAnna Price as Ellen\nBernard Mensah as TJ\tArun Nahar as Jake\nBrandon McDonald as Oli\tBessie Cursons as Christy\nCadi Mullane as Crystal\tBethany Carter as Daisy\nCaitlin Cronin as Lucy\tCharlie Dixon as Thomas\nDominic McKernan as Dan\tCherie Ng as Nicola\nEllie Coldicutt as Beth\tEleanor Bonas as Rachel\nFaye Dolan as Jade\tFrancesca York as Caroline\nJames Warner as Buddy\tFreddie Watkins as Sebastian\nJake Pratt as Alfie\tGeorgina Owen as Emily\nJoe Lane as Edward\tHannah Ciotknowski as Elizabeth\nJoshan Patel as Bill\tHarriet Kilner as Charlotte\nKrista Hyatt as Becky\tHayley Downing as Victoria\nMaeve Dolan as Sam\tImogen Stern as Phoebe\nMichael McAuley as William\tKatie Maguire as Megan\nMilly Webb as Neve\tKatie Stafford as Molly\nMorgan Brennan as Charlotte\tLauren Downing as Joanne\nRebecca Maguire as Saffron\tLily-Rose Sharry as Lynette\nReece Stowe as Fraser\tMichael Brown as Charles\nRhyannon Jones as Alice\tMolly Burton as Catherine\nSam Tott as Matt\tMi Tuulikki Kelly as Lorna\nSydney Isitt-Ager as Sadie\tSafiya Asharia as Sophie\nThomas McGaritty as Zack\tSalim Zayyan as Percival\nOscar Steer as Auditionee\tTaylor Drew as Harry\nHarvey Flanagan as Tyrese\tChris Reynolds as Freddy\nProduction\nThe film was first announced in August 2008, when it was announced Martin Freeman would star.[6] Principal photography began in the same month.\nBox office\nWhen released in the United Kingdom, the movie opened at #5, taking \u00a3794,314 at the box office in the United Kingdom.

One of the most persistent was originally chartered in 1868 as the Hudson Highland Suspension Bridge Company, whose proposed bridge would have crossed from [[Anthony's Nose (Westchester)|Anthony's Nose]] to [[Fort Clinton]], now roughly the site of the [[Bear Mountain Bridge]]. It was never built.\n\nThe Poughkeepsie Bridge Company was chartered in June 1871 to build the bridge, and [[J. Edgar Thomson]] of the [[Pennsylvania Railroad]] was persuaded to support the effort. Contracts were let to a firm called the American Bridge Company (not the [[American Bridge Company|company of the same name]] founded later), but the [[Panic of 1873]] intervened and the scheme collapsed.\n\nIn 1886, the Manhattan Bridge Building Company was organized to finance the construction. Among the prominent backers was [[Henry Clay Frick]], the coal tycoon and associate of [[Andrew Carnegie]]. The [[Union Bridge Company]] of [[Athens, Pennsylvania]], which had completed the [[Michigan Central Railway|Michigan Central]] cantilever bridge at Niagara (see [[Niagara Cantilever Bridge]]), was subcontracted to build the Poughkeepsie Bridge. Dawson, Symmes and Usher were the foundation engineers, while John F. O'Rourke, P. P. Dickinson and Arthur B. Paine were the structural engineers. The bridge was designed by [[Charles Macdonald (architect)|Charles Macdonald]] and Arthur B. Paine. As is typical for cantilever bridges, construction was carried out by constructing cribwork, masonry piers, towers, fixed truss sections on falsework, and finally cantilever sections, with the final cantilever interconnection (suspended) spans floated out or raised with [[falsework]]. The first train crossed the bridge on December 29, 1888, and it was formally opened for scheduled passenger service on January 1, 1889.\n\nConsidered an engineering marvel of the day, the bridge has seven main spans. The total length is {{convert|6,768|ft|m}}, including approaches, and the top of the deck is {{convert|212|ft|m}} above water. It is a multispan cantilever truss bridge, having two river-crossing cantilever spans of {{convert|548|ft|m}} each, one center span of {{convert|546|ft|m}}, two anchor (connecting) spans of {{convert|525|ft|m}}, two shore spans of {{convert|201|ft|m}} each, a {{convert|2,641|ft|m}} approach viaduct on the eastern bank and a {{convert|1,033|ft|m}} approach viaduct on the western bank. All seven spans were built of newly available Bessemer Process \"mild\" (between 0.16% and 0.29% carbon) steel, while the two approach viaducts were built of iron. It formed part of the most direct rail route between the industrial northeastern states and the midwestern and western states.<ref>POUGHKEEPSIE EAGLE Souvenir Edition dated January 1, 1889; plus independent engineering articles from the period.</ref>\n\n===Operation===\n[[File:Detroit Photographic Company (0676).jpg|thumb|left|Poughkeepsie Bridge ca. 1900]]\n[[File:Under the Bridge, Poughkeepsie, N.

Traffic from the connecting [[New York, Ontario & Western]] ceased when that railroad shut down on March 30, 1957. Another connection, the coal-, slate-, and cement-hauling [[Lehigh & New England]], shut down in 1961. At the same time, some new traffic began crossing the bridge, such as the [[New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad|New Haven's]] \"Super Jet\", one of the first trains to carry truck trailers. The [[Penn Central Transportation Company|Penn Central]]'s acquisition of the [[New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad|New Haven]] in 1969 discouraged connecting traffic with the [[Erie Lackawanna]], which competed with other Penn Central routes. After 1971, only one through train in each direction, for [[Erie Lackawanna]], crossed the bridge.<ref name=swanberg>{{Citation | last = Swanberg | first = J.W. | title = Railroad Blueprint: Maybrook, New York| journal = Trains Magazine |date=January 2005 | pages = 50\u201359}}</ref>\n\nWhile the Penn Central did not connect with the old New Haven on the west side of the bridge, it came close. For a short time in 1969 and 1970, Penn Central ran a daily train between [[Cedar Hill Yard]] in [[New Haven, Connecticut]] and [[Potomac Yard]] in [[Alexandria, Virginia]], by way of the [[Lehigh and Hudson River Railway]], which connected with the [[Penn Central]] [[Belvidere Delaware Railroad|Belvidere Division]] in [[Belvidere, New Jersey]], 72 miles south of the old interchange with the New Haven at [[Maybrook Yard]] in [[Maybrook, New York]]. The service ended in a dispute over haulage charges and the traffic was diverted to the longer all-Penn Central route through [[Selkirk, New York]]. Ironically, the only reason the [[Lehigh and Hudson River]] was not part of the Penn Central was because a Penn Central predecessor, the [[Pennsylvania Railroad]], had prevented the New Haven from acquiring it in 1905.<ref name=swanberg/> The [[Lehigh and Hudson River]] and Erie Lackawanna were finally joined with the Penn Central when all were taken over by [[Conrail]] in 1976.\n\nOn May 8, 1974 a [[Railroad tie|tie]] fire damaged about {{convert|700|ft|m}} of decking and underlying girders on the bridge's eastern section.<ref>{{cite news | last = Cruz | first = Roberto | title = Railroad bridge fire 40th anniversary: Fire in the sky | newspaper = The Poughkeepsie Journal | date = May 7, 2014 | url = http://www.poughkeepsiejournal.com/story/news/local/2014/05/07/poughkeepsie-railroad-fire-anniversary/8831573/ | accessdate =  January 2, 2015}}</ref> It was likely started by a spark from an eastbound freight train that had just crossed the span.<ref>{{Citation | last  = Sutherland | first = Joseph | title = Fire Closes Rail Bridge 3 Months | newspaper = The Evening News | location = Newburgh, NY | date = May 9, 1974 | page = 1 | url = https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=R1VRAAAAIBAJ&sjid=4DMNAAAAIBAJ&pg=1613%2C1667620 }}</ref> The Penn Central had neglected the bridge's fire-protection system, which had no water on the day of the fire, and had laid off employees who kept watch for such fires.<ref name=mabee /> A photograph of the last train, a run-through from the [[Erie Lackawanna]], was included in a 40th anniversary web feature by the [[Poughkeepsie Journal]].<ref>{{cite news | last = Cusumano | first = Chris | title = INTERACTIVE: How the Poughkeepsie Railroad Bridge fire changed history | newspaper = The Poughkeepsie Journal | date = May 7, 2014 | url = http://www.poughkeepsiejournal.com/longform/news/2014/05/07/bridgefire/8725801/ | accessdate = January 2, 2015}}</ref>\n\nIn August 1974, the Penn Central applied for $1.75 million to repair and improve the bridge from the federal government through the [[Regional Rail Reorganization Act]] of 1973.<ref>{{Citation | title = Fate of Poughkeepsie Rail Bridge Up to Court | newspaper = The Evening News | location = Newburgh, NY | date = August 30, 1974  | page = 4A | url = https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=IlRRAAAAIBAJ&sjid=rTMNAAAAIBAJ&pg=987%2C5261610 }}</ref> By 1975, efforts had shifted to acquiring a combination of state and railroad funding.

The proposal seemed so absurd that the ''Eagle'' ridiculed it, and it was effectively forgotten for a few years.<ref name=mabee>{{cite book|last=Mabee|first=Carleton|title=Bridging The Hudson: The Poughkeepsie-Highland Railroad Bridge and Its Connecting Railroad Lines|publisher=Purple Mountain Press|year=2001|isbn=1-930098-24-3 }}</ref><ref name=WalkwayHist>{{cite web |url=https://walkway.org/history |title=History |publisher=Walkway Over the Hudson |accessdate=December 8, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170401162715/https://walkway.org/history |archive-date=April 1, 2017 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nOver the years, many plans had been made for a [[fixed span]] across the [[Hudson River]] south of [[Albany, New York|Albany]] to replace numerous [[car float]] and ferry operations. One of the most persistent was originally chartered in 1868 as the Hudson Highland Suspension Bridge Company, whose proposed bridge would have crossed from [[Anthony's Nose (Westchester)|Anthony's Nose]] to [[Fort Clinton]], now roughly the site of the [[Bear Mountain Bridge]]. It was never built.\n\nThe Poughkeepsie Bridge Company was chartered in June 1871 to build the bridge, and [[J. Edgar Thomson]] of the [[Pennsylvania Railroad]] was persuaded to support the effort. Contracts were let to a firm called the American Bridge Company (not the [[American Bridge Company|company of the same name]] founded later), but the [[Panic of 1873]] intervened and the scheme collapsed.\n\nIn 1886, the Manhattan Bridge Building Company was organized to finance the construction. Among the prominent backers was [[Henry Clay Frick]], the coal tycoon and associate of [[Andrew Carnegie]]. The [[Union Bridge Company]] of [[Athens, Pennsylvania]], which had completed the [[Michigan Central Railway|Michigan Central]] cantilever bridge at Niagara (see [[Niagara Cantilever Bridge]]), was subcontracted to build the Poughkeepsie Bridge. Dawson, Symmes and Usher were the foundation engineers, while John F. O'Rourke, P. P. Dickinson and Arthur B. Paine were the structural engineers. The bridge was designed by [[Charles Macdonald (architect)|Charles Macdonald]] and Arthur B. Paine. As is typical for cantilever bridges, construction was carried out by constructing cribwork, masonry piers, towers, fixed truss sections on falsework, and finally cantilever sections, with the final cantilever interconnection (suspended) spans floated out or raised with [[falsework]]. The first train crossed the bridge on December 29, 1888, and it was formally opened for scheduled passenger service on January 1, 1889.\n\nConsidered an engineering marvel of the day, the bridge has seven main spans. The total length is {{convert|6,768|ft|m}}, including approaches, and the top of the deck is {{convert|212|ft|m}} above water. It is a multispan cantilever truss bridge, having two river-crossing cantilever spans of {{convert|548|ft|m}} each, one center span of {{convert|546|ft|m}}, two anchor (connecting) spans of {{convert|525|ft|m}}, two shore spans of {{convert|201|ft|m}} each, a {{convert|2,641|ft|m}} approach viaduct on the eastern bank and a {{convert|1,033|ft|m}} approach viaduct on the western bank. All seven spans were built of newly available Bessemer Process \"mild\" (between 0.16% and 0.29% carbon) steel, while the two approach viaducts were built of iron. It formed part of the most direct rail route between the industrial northeastern states and the midwestern and western states.<ref>POUGHKEEPSIE EAGLE Souvenir Edition dated January 1, 1889; plus independent engineering articles from the period.</ref>\n\n===Operation===\n[[File:Detroit Photographic Company (0676).jpg|thumb|left|Poughkeepsie Bridge ca. 1900]]\n[[File:Under the Bridge, Poughkeepsie, N.

Traffic from the connecting [[New York, Ontario & Western]] ceased when that railroad shut down on March 30, 1957. Another connection, the coal-, slate-, and cement-hauling [[Lehigh & New England]], shut down in 1961. At the same time, some new traffic began crossing the bridge, such as the [[New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad|New Haven's]] \"Super Jet\", one of the first trains to carry truck trailers. The [[Penn Central Transportation Company|Penn Central]]'s acquisition of the [[New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad|New Haven]] in 1969 discouraged connecting traffic with the [[Erie Lackawanna]], which competed with other Penn Central routes. After 1971, only one through train in each direction, for [[Erie Lackawanna]], crossed the bridge.<ref name=swanberg>{{Citation | last = Swanberg | first = J.W. | title = Railroad Blueprint: Maybrook, New York| journal = Trains Magazine |date=January 2005 | pages = 50\u201359}}</ref>\n\nWhile the Penn Central did not connect with the old New Haven on the west side of the bridge, it came close. For a short time in 1969 and 1970, Penn Central ran a daily train between [[Cedar Hill Yard]] in [[New Haven, Connecticut]] and [[Potomac Yard]] in [[Alexandria, Virginia]], by way of the [[Lehigh and Hudson River Railway]], which connected with the [[Penn Central]] [[Belvidere Delaware Railroad|Belvidere Division]] in [[Belvidere, New Jersey]], 72 miles south of the old interchange with the New Haven at [[Maybrook Yard]] in [[Maybrook, New York]].

According to Shia belief, a verse of the Quran was revealed instructing Muhammad to deliver an important message. The Muslims were gathered and Muhammad delivered a lengthy sermon. The speech included the famous statement by Muhammad that \"Anyone who has me as his ''[[mawla]]'', has Ali as his ''mawla''\". Shi'ites interpret this phrase to be the designation of Ali as Muhammad's heir, though this is disputed by [[Sunni Muslim]]s. Shia traditions also state that the last [[Ayat|verse]] of the [[Quran]], which is the third verse of [[Al-Ma'ida]]h (the fifth [[Sura|chapter]] of the Quran), was then revealed: \"This day I have perfected your Religion for you: Completed My favour upon you, and have chosen for you Islam as your Religion.\"<ref name=\"Razwy\">{{cite book |last1=Razwy |first1=Sayed Ali Asgher |title=A Restatement of the History of Islam and Muslims |pages=274\u2013276}}</ref>\n\nWhile Sunnis hold little significance to Ghadir Khumm,<ref name=CampoP257-58/> Shi'ites consider it to mark the completion of Islam<ref>{{cite web |title=Imam Khomeini defined Ghadir as most magnificent feast |url=http://en.imam-khomeini.ir/en/n27439/Imam-Khomeini-defined-Ghadir-as-most-magnificent-feast |accessdate=1 September 2018}}</ref> as well as the official appointment of Ali as [[Succession to Muhammad|Muhammad's successor LISTEN PEOPLE YOU SUNNIS MUSLIMS HAVE BEEN MISGUIDED WALLAH YOU KNOW THE EVENT AND STILL LIE AND HIDE STOP]].<ref name=\"Razwy\"/>\n\n==Historical sources==\nMost historical sources regarding the life of Muhammad (such as [[Al-Tabari]], [[Ibn Hisham]] and [[Ibn Sa'd]]){{NoteTag|A two volume work by Al-Tabari regarding Ghadir Khumm was believed to have existed, but had been left unfinished and has since been lost.<ref name=\"EncyclopediaIslam\"/><ref name=Amir-Moezzi/>}} either make no mention of Ghadir Khumm or, if it is acknowledged, avoid discussion of Muhammad's address.

However, he chose to withhold this information from his followers until such a time that Ali would not face opposition to his ascension.

He also disclosed his own impending death and urged the Muslims to be [[Hadith al-Thaqalayn|faithful to two things]]: the Quran and [[Ahl al-Bayt|his family]].

Ali was said to have been austere in regards to the distribution of booty during the expedition. This behaviour affected his popularity among the soldiers, with doubts being raised regarding his integrity and accusations of greed and misuse of authority being levied against him.

Some have questioned the veracity of Muhammad naming Ali his successor, as well as the subsequent oaths of allegiance, given that there is evidence that Ali was not present at Ghadir Khumm at all, instead being stationed in [[Yemen]] at the time. Historian [[Al-Tabari]] published his two-volume work (now lost), ''Ahadith Ghadir Khumm'', to refute this belief upon learning of it from a Baghdadi scholar. However, [[Ibn Kathir]], another influential historian, disputed the work and upheld the theory, stating that Al-Tabari had failed to distinguish between weak and reliable sources.<ref name=WainKamaliP89-90>Alexander Wain, Mohammad Hashim Kamali, ''The Architects of Islamic Civilisation'' (2017), p. 89-90</ref>\n\nIn addition to this, it may be considered unlikely for Muhammad to have chosen a successor in Ali, given the latter's relative youth, being approximately thirty years old at the time of the speech. It is notable that Arabs of this period traditionally avoided entrusting young and untried men with great responsibilities. Historian M. A. Shaban adds that his sources regarding the community at [[Medina]] at the time gave no indication of them reacting as they would have done had they heard of this designation. Shaban concludes that had Muhammad intended on a successor at all, his most practical option would have been for his followers to choose one amongst themselves.<ref name=ShabanP16>M. A.

The speech included the famous statement by Muhammad that \"Anyone who has me as his ''[[mawla]]'', has Ali as his ''mawla''\". Shi'ites interpret this phrase to be the designation of Ali as Muhammad's heir, though this is disputed by [[Sunni Muslim]]s.

In response, the gathered shouted their agreement.<ref name=\"EncyclopediaIslam\"/> Muhammad then gave the famous proclamation \"Anyone who has me as his ''[[mawla]]'', has Ali as his ''mawla''\".

In such versions, Muhammad is stated to have previously been aware (through divine inspiration) that Ali was to succeed him as leader of the [[Ummah|Muslim community]]. However, he chose to withhold this information from his followers until such a time that Ali would not face opposition to his ascension. At Ghadir Khumm, Muhammad received the [[Quran]]ic revelation to \"communicate that which was revealed to you by your Lord\" ({{Cite Quran|5|67|style=nosup}}).<ref name=\"EncyclopediaIslam\"/> Some versions of this last tradition state that the Quran, prior to an alleged falsification by enemies of Ali, explicitly mentioned his succession in this verse.<ref name=Amir-Moezzi/>{{NoteTag|The original verse was said to have been \"communicate that which was revealed to you by your Lord ''about Ali''\".<ref name=Amir-Moezzi/>}}\n\nMuhammad then addressed the Muslims with the ''\"Mawla\"'' statement, which was to be taken as the official designation of Ali as his successor. He also disclosed his own impending death and urged the Muslims to be [[Hadith al-Thaqalayn|faithful to two things]]: the Quran and [[Ahl al-Bayt|his family]]. After performing prayers, Muhammad and Ali went to the former's tent and there, on Muhammad's orders, Ali received the congratulations of the Muslims who acclaimed him as ''[[Amir al-Mu'minin]]'' (Commander of the Faithful).<ref name=\"EncyclopediaIslam\"/> Among these well-wishers were the later caliphs [[Abu Bakr]] and [[Umar]], as well as [[Abd Allah ibn Abbas|Ibn Abbas]].<ref>{{harvtxt|Eliash|1966|pp=149\u201350}}</ref> The poet [[Hassan ibn Thabit]] was also said to have composed, with Muhammad's approval, a poem in honour of Ali's nomination.<ref name=\"EncyclopediaIslam\"/> Muhammad then commemorated the day by declaring it to be the \"[[Eid al-Ghadir|Greatest Eid]]\" of Islam.<ref name=NajafabadiP259/>\n\n=== Revelation of the verse of ''Ikmal al-Din'' ===\n{{main article|Verse of Ikmal al-Din}}\nAccording to Shi'ite scholar [[Sheikh Abdul Hosein Amini]]'s work ''[[Al-Ghadir]]'', immediately after Muhammad had finished his speech, the following verse of the Quran was revealed:<ref>{{cite book|last1=al-Bahrani|first1=Seyyed Hashim|title=Al-Burhan Fi Tafsir al-Quran|volume=1|pages=434\u2013437|title-link=Al-Burhan Fi Tafsir al-Quran}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Makarem Shirazi|first1=Naser|title=Tafsir Nemooneh|volume=4|pages=263\u2013271|title-link=Tafsir Nemooneh}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Sobhani|first1=Ja'far|title=Al-Iman va al-Kofr fi al-Ketab va al-Sunnah|volume=1|page=244}}</ref>\n\n<blockquote>This day have those who reject faith given up all hope of your religion: yet fear them not but fear Me. This day have I perfected your religion for you, completed My favour upon you, and have chosen for you Islam as your religion. ({{Cite Quran|5|3|style=nosup}})</blockquote>\n\nThis verse has been viewed to have been the last part of the Quran to be revealed.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Khan |first=Wahiduddin |authorlink=Wahiduddin Khan |title=The Prophet of Peace: Teachings of the Prophet Muhammad |year=2009 |page=67 |publisher=Penguin Group |isbn=978-0-1430-6817-4 |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=QZQ6CmM4xlAC&pg=PA67 |ref=harv}}</ref> Again in regards to the alleged falsification of the Quran, it is also said to have originally contained an overt reference to Ali. The unadulterated version was claimed to have been \"This day, I have perfected your religion for you ''thanks to the [[Walayah|walaya]] of Ali ibn Abi \u1e6calib'' and completed My favour unto you\".<ref name=Amir-Moezzi/> However, the verse is typically not believed to have been associated with Ghadir Khumm, but is instead generally accepted to have been revealed on the [[Day of Arafah]] some days earlier.<ref name=\"EncyclopediaIslam\"/>\n\n==Interpretation and views==\n===Meaning of Mawla===\n{{Main|Mawla}}\n''Mawla'' has a number of meanings in [[Arabic]], with interpretations of Muhammad's use here being split along sectarian lines between the Sunni and Shia. Among the former group, the word is translated as \"friend\" or \"one who is loyal/close\" and that Muhammad was advocating that Ali was deserving of friendship and respect. Conversely, Shi'ites tend to view the meaning as being \"master\" or \"ruler\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.islamawareness.net/Deviant/Shia/ghadir.html |title=The Event of Ghadir Khumm in the Qur'an, Hadith, History |website=islamawareness.net |access-date=2005-09-02 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060107160547/http://www.islamawareness.net/Deviant/Shia/ghadir.html |archive-date=2006-01-07 |url-status=live |ref=harv}}</ref> and that the statement was a clear designation of Ali being Muhammad's appointed successor.<ref name=Amir-Moezzi/> The uncertainty of Muhammad's use of the word is somewhat proved by the fact that in some versions of the event, ''mawla'' is swapped out in favour of the less ambiguous term ''[[wali]]''.<ref name=\"EncyclopediaIslam\"/>\n\n===Sunni views===\nAmong Sunnis, Ghadir Khumm is not associated with Ali's succession and is considered to be of little significance.<ref name=CampoP257-58>{{Cite book |last=Campo |first=Juan Eduardo |title=Encyclopedia of Islam |year=2009 |pages=257\u201358 |publisher=Infobase Publishing |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=OZbyz_Hr-eIC&pg=PA257|ref=harv|isbn=9781438126968 }}</ref> Instead, the Sunni historian [[Ibn Kathir]] connects the event with Ali's campaign in Yemen, from which he had just returned prior to accompanying Muhammad on the [[Farewell Pilgrimage]]. Ali was said to have been austere in regards to the distribution of booty during the expedition. This behaviour affected his popularity among the soldiers, with doubts being raised regarding his integrity and accusations of greed and misuse of authority being levied against him. Ibn Kathir thus suggests that Muhammad, wishing to pacify these protests, used Ghadir Khumm to publicly declare his love and esteem for Ali.<ref name=\"EncyclopediaIslam\"/> Other sources though have questioned whether it would be logical to make such a public announcement in response to a relatively isolated issue.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Rizvi |first=Sayyid Muhammad |title=Sh\u00ed'ism: Im\u00e3mate & Wil\u00e3yat |year=1999 |page=33 |publisher=MEBS Printing Plus Ltd. |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=kjauDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA36 |ref=harv|isbn=9780920675113 }}</ref>\n\n===Shia views===\nGhadir Khumm is seen as the official designation of Ali as the intended heir to Muhammad as both the spiritual and temporal leader of the [[Ummah|Muslim community]].<ref name=CampoP257-58/><ref>{{harvtxt|Donaldson|1933|p=XXV}}</ref> It is viewed to be the single most important evidence for the succession of Ali and his descendants, as well as the granting to them of the unique authority to interpret the Quran.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Sanders |first=Paula |title=Ritual, Politics, and the City in Fatimid Cairo |year=1994 |page=122 |publisher=State University of New York Press |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=jH-57_-auocC&pg=PA122 |ref=harv|isbn=9781438418629 }}</ref> As a result, the date of the sermon is considered to be one of the foundational events of Shia Islam, with the anniversary being one of its most important annual celebrations.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Lindsay |first=James E. |title=Daily Life in the Medieval Islamic World |year=1957 |page=163 |publisher=Greenwood Press |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=6J0WnWABM34C&pg=PA163 |ref=harv|isbn=9780313322709 }}</ref><ref name=CampoP257-58/> Among Shi'ites, the importance of Ghadir Khumm was proved when Ali, twenty-five years after the event, publicly referenced it.<ref>{{harvtxt|Rizvi|1999|p=33}}</ref> In 658, while standing in front of [[Great Mosque of Kufa|the mosque]] at [[Kufa]], Ali called for witnesses from Ghadir Khumm to testify to it, to which a dozen or so individuals stepped forward.

Some have questioned the veracity of Muhammad naming Ali his successor, as well as the subsequent oaths of allegiance, given that there is evidence that Ali was not present at Ghadir Khumm at all, instead being stationed in [[Yemen]] at the time. Historian [[Al-Tabari]] published his two-volume work (now lost), ''Ahadith Ghadir Khumm'', to refute this belief upon learning of it from a Baghdadi scholar. However, [[Ibn Kathir]], another influential historian, disputed the work and upheld the theory, stating that Al-Tabari had failed to distinguish between weak and reliable sources.<ref name=WainKamaliP89-90>Alexander Wain, Mohammad Hashim Kamali, ''The Architects of Islamic Civilisation'' (2017), p. 89-90</ref>\n\nIn addition to this, it may be considered unlikely for Muhammad to have chosen a successor in Ali, given the latter's relative youth, being approximately thirty years old at the time of the speech. It is notable that Arabs of this period traditionally avoided entrusting young and untried men with great responsibilities. Historian M. A. Shaban adds that his sources regarding the community at [[Medina]] at the time gave no indication of them reacting as they would have done had they heard of this designation. Shaban concludes that had Muhammad intended on a successor at all, his most practical option would have been for his followers to choose one amongst themselves.<ref name=ShabanP16>M. A.

It was jointly produced by Hirani and [[Vidhu Vinod Chopra]] under the banners Rajkumar Hirani Films and [[Vinod Chopra Films]] respectively. The film follows the life of [[Bollywood]] actor [[Sanjay Dutt]], his addiction with drugs, arrest for alleged [[1993 Bombay bombings#Sanjay Dutt and co-conspirators|association with the 1993 Bombay bombings]], relationship with his father, comeback in the industry, the eventual drop of charges from bombay blasts, and release after completing his jail term. [[Ranbir Kapoor]] stars as Dutt, along with an ensemble cast which features [[Paresh Rawal]], [[Vicky Kaushal]], [[Manisha Koirala]], [[Dia Mirza]], [[Sonam Kapoor]], [[Anushka Sharma]] and [[Jim Sarbh]].\n\nIn a conversation with Hirani, Dutt shared anecdotes from his life, which the former found intriguing and prompted him to make a film based on Dutt's life. It was titled ''Sanju'' after the nickname Dutt's mother [[Nargis]] used to call him. Principal photography began in January 2017 and was completed by January 2018. The film's soundtrack was composed by Rohan-Rohan and Vikram Montrose, with [[A. R. Rahman]] as a guest composer. [[Fox Star Studios]] acquired the distribution rights of the film.\n\n''Sanju'' was released worldwide on 29 June 2018. It received positive reviews from critics, who praised Kapoor and Kaushal's performance as well as Hirani's direction; some criticised its supposed image-cleansing of its protagonist. It registered the highest opening for any film released in India in 2018, and on its third day, it had the highest single day collection ever for a Hindi film in India. With a worldwide gross of over {{INRConvert|586.85|c}}, ''Sanju'' emerged as the [[List of Bollywood films of 2018#Box office collection|highest grossing Bollywood film of 2018]], the second [[List of highest domestic net collection of Hindi films|highest-earning Hindi film]] in India of all time, and one of the [[List of highest-grossing Indian films|highest-grossing Indian films]].\n\n''Sanju'' earned seven nominations at the [[64th Filmfare Awards]] including [[Filmfare Award for Best Film|Best Film]] and [[Filmfare Award for Best Director|Best Director]] for Hirani. It won [[Filmfare Award for Best Actor|Best Actor]] for Kapoor and [[Filmfare Award for Best Supporting Actor|Best Supporting Actor]] for Kaushal.\n\n== Plot ==\nThe film starts with D. N. Tripathi ([[Piyush Mishra]]), a lyricist, who writes a biography on [[Sanjay Dutt|Sanjay \"Sanju\" Dutt]], ([[Ranbir Kapoor]]), comparing him with [[Mahatma Gandhi]]. A flabbergasted Sanjay has him thrown out. The [[Supreme Court of India ]] delivers its verdict regarding the [[1993 Bombay bombings]] and sentences Dutt to five years jail term for violating the [[Arms Act, 1959]]. His wife [[Manyata Dutt]] ([[Dia Mirza]]) approaches Winnie Diaz, ([[Anushka Sharma]]) a London-based writer, to write Sanjay's biography and present his version of his life to the public. Although unwilling at first, Winnie is asked by Zubin Mistry ([[Jim Sarbh]]), a real estate builder, to not write the biography, which intrigues her. Winnie first interviews Sanjay, and his life is revealed in a flashback.\n\nSanjay's father [[Sunil Dutt]] ([[Paresh Rawal]]) plans to launch his acting career in [[Bollywood]] with the film ''[[Rocky (1981 film)|Rocky]]'' (1981). Upset over his father's controlling behaviour on set, Sanjay is encouraged by his friend Zubin \"God\" Mistry to try drugs for the first time. Sanjay soon discovers that his mother [[Nargis]] ([[Manisha Koirala]]) is suffering from cancer and is taken to New York for treatment. This incident furthers his descent into alcoholism and drug addiction. He meets Kamlesh ([[Vicky Kaushal]]), a fan of Nargis, in New York, and they become quick friends. Kamlesh manages to make Sanjay stay away from his addiction; after learning of his girlfriend Ruby's ([[Sonam Kapoor]]) fixed marriage due to his ongoing drug addiction, Sanjay relapses. Kamli convinces Ruby to register marry Sanjay; but when Ruby after realising her love for Sanjay, she agrees and comes to the registration office, only to find that he is not there and on reaching Sanjay's house realizes that he is still under the influence of drugs and decides to leave him. Nargis passes away three days before the release of ''Rocky'', which takes an emotional toll on Sanjay. Sanjay agrees to attend a rehabilitation centre in the United States, and eventually recovers with the help of his father and Kamlesh. On returning to India, he meets with 'God' his friend and beats him for selling him drugs. Sanjay realizes that he was given drugs while 'God' himself was consuming glucose.\n\nThe later part of Dutt's life is narrated by his now-estranged friend Kamlesh, who Winnie tracks down in New York.Kamlesh is at first reluctant since he has wasted many years of his life on Sanju but finally agrees to tell her the story. In the 1990s, Sanjay turns to bodybuilding and his career in Bollywood has greatly improved. After the 1992 [[Babri Masjid]] demolition, Sanjay acquires three [[AK-56]] rifles to ensure the protection of his father, who had by then ventured into politics, and sister, [[Priya Dutt]]. A [[1993 Bombay bombings|series of bombings occur]] in Bombay shortly thereafter. Sanjay is arrested in 1993 for possession of illegal arms supposedly supplied by the [[D-Company]] to be trafficked for protection during potential communal rioting after the bombings. Sanjay is convicted and sentenced to imprisonment for five years under [[Terrorist and Disruptive Activities (Prevention) Act]] (TADA), threatening his career. Indian media labels him as a terrorist, further tarnishing his public image. Believing Sanjay to be guilty, Kamlesh severs ties with him.\n\nAfter his release in 1995, Sanjay appears in a string of flops. When his popularity had begun to wane, he is forced to sign for the [[Munna Bhai|title role]] in ''[[Munna Bhai M.B.B.S.]]'' (2003) by his father, who also features in the movie. Sanjay's performance garners him the [[Filmfare Award for Best Performance in a Comic Role]] and his public image improves, making his father proud. Shortly afterwards, his father passes away. In 2006, the Bombay High Court finds Dutt guilty under the Possession of Arms Act, while not finding him to be a terrorist. In 2013, he is arrested again by the same verdict upheld by the [[Supreme Court of India]]. Sanjay convinces Winnie and Kamlesh of his innocence by blaming the media for falsely accusing him of terrorism, and is subsequently released from prison in 2016. Sanjay finds out that Winnie has completed writing his biography, titled ''Kuch Toh Log Kahenge'' ({{translation}} People will keep saying something), named after one of his father's favourite songs from the film ''[[Amar Prem]]'' (1972). He exits the jail and reunites with Kamlesh and [[Manyata Dutt|Manyata]].\n\n== Cast ==\n{{div col}}\n*[[Ranbir Kapoor]] as [[Sanjay Dutt|Sanjay \"Sanju\" Dutt]]<ref>{{cite web |last1=Correspondent |first1=HT |title=From Ranbir Kapoor to Dia Mirza, a reel vs real rundown of who plays who in Sanju |url=https://www.hindustantimes.com/bollywood/from-ranbir-kapoor-to-dia-mirza-a-reel-vs-real-rundown-of-who-plays-who-in-sanju/story-A47rLhKBYSqa35hKX3iDaN.html |website=hindustantimes.com |publisher=Hindustan Times |accessdate=24 June 2018 |date=24 June 2018 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180624051103/https://www.hindustantimes.com/bollywood/from-ranbir-kapoor-to-dia-mirza-a-reel-vs-real-rundown-of-who-plays-who-in-sanju/story-A47rLhKBYSqa35hKX3iDaN.html |archivedate=24 June 2018  }}</ref>\n*[[Paresh Rawal]] as [[Sunil Dutt]], Sanju's father<ref>{{cite web|url=http://indianexpress.com/article/entertainment/bollywood/dia-mirza-to-play-manyata-in-sanjay-dutt-bipoic-4485399|title=Sanjay Dutt biopic: Dia Mirza to play Manyata in Ranbir Kapoor film|date=21 January 2017|accessdate=25 March 2017|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170202235936/http://indianexpress.com/article/entertainment/bollywood/dia-mirza-to-play-manyata-in-sanjay-dutt-bipoic-4485399/|archivedate=2 February 2017}}</ref>\n*[[Vicky Kaushal]] as Kamlesh \"Kamli\" Kanhaiyalal Kapasi, Sanju's best friend\n*[[Sonam Kapoor]] as Ruby (Tina Munim) \n*[[Dia Mirza]] as [[Manyata Dutt]], Sanju's wife\n*[[Manisha Koirala]] as [[Nargis]], Sanju's mother<ref name=\"MensXP cast\" /><ref name=\"Firstpost cast\">{{cite web|url=http://www.firstpost.com/entertainment/rajkumar-hiranis-sanjay-dutt-biopic-has-a-stellar-ensemble-cast-to-watch-out-for-3208020.html|title=Rajkumar Hirani's Sanjay Dutt biopic has a stellar ensemble cast to watch out for|date=17 January 2017|accessdate=25 March 2017|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170429162423/http://www.firstpost.com/entertainment/rajkumar-hiranis-sanjay-dutt-biopic-has-a-stellar-ensemble-cast-to-watch-out-for-3208020.html|archivedate=29 April 2017}}</ref>\n*[[Anushka Sharma]] as Winnie Dias, a biographer<ref name=\"auto\">{{cite web |last1=Correspondent |first1=HT |title=At Sanju's trailer launch, the mystery behind Anushka Sharma's role revealed |url=https://www.hindustantimes.com/bollywood/at-sanju-s-trailer-launch-the-mystery-behind-anushka-sharma-s-role-revealed/story-L05jRl2CgfAUdNokVY2gIK.html |website=hindustantimes.com |accessdate=30 May 2018 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180530233315/https://www.hindustantimes.com/bollywood/at-sanju-s-trailer-launch-the-mystery-behind-anushka-sharma-s-role-revealed/story-L05jRl2CgfAUdNokVY2gIK.html |archivedate=30 May 2018  }}</ref>\n*[[Jim Sarbh]] as Zubin \"GOD\" Mistry.<ref name=\"India.com cast\">{{cite web|url=http://www.india.com/showbiz/anushka-sharma-sonam-kapoor-jim-sarbh-dia-mirza-to-join-ranbir-kapoor-starrer-sanjay-dutt-biopic-cast-1761087|title=Anushka Sharma, Sonam bewafa hain Kapoor, Jim Sarbh, Dia Mirza to join Ranbir Kapoor starrer Sanjay Dutt Biopic cast!|last=Kulkarni|first=Prachi|date=15 January 2017|accessdate=25 March 2017|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170429101009/http://www.india.com/showbiz/anushka-sharma-sonam-kapoor-jim-sarbh-dia-mirza-to-join-ranbir-kapoor-starrer-sanjay-dutt-biopic-cast-1761087/|archivedate=29 April 2017}}</ref>\n*[[Karishma Tanna]] as Pinky.<ref name=\"MensXP cast\">{{Cite news|url=http://m.mensxp.com/entertainment/gossip/35784-the-cast-of-sanjay-dutt-rsquo-s-biopic-has-been-revealed-and-it-rsquo-s-so-perfect-we-can-rsquo-t-wait-for-the-film.html|title=The Cast Of Sanjay Dutt's Biopic Has Been Revealed And It's So Perfect We Can't Wait For The Film|last=Sen|first=Neil W.|work=www.mensxp.com|access-date=25 March 2017}}</ref>\n*[[Boman Irani]] as Jayaram Joshi, Ruby's father (He also appears as Dr. Asthana of [[Munna Bhai MBBS]] in archive footage)<ref>{{cite web |last1=Sharma |first1=Dipti |title=Boman Irani on Sanjay Dutt biopic: There are certain stories only Rajkumar Hirani can tell |url=https://indianexpress.com/article/entertainment/bollywood/boman-irani-on-sanjay-dutt-biopic-they-are-certain-stories-only-rajkumar-hirani-can-tell-4739977/ |website=indianexpress.com |publisher=Indian Express |accessdate=17 June 2018 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170911002514/http://indianexpress.com/article/entertainment/bollywood/boman-irani-on-sanjay-dutt-biopic-they-are-certain-stories-only-rajkumar-hirani-can-tell-4739977/ |archivedate=11 September 2017  }}</ref>\n*[[Sayaji Shinde]] as Bandu Dada\n*[[Piyush Mishra]] as D.N.

He stated that \"It will talk about human flaws, the emotional father-son story (between Sanjay and the late Sunil Dutt), his relationship with his best friend, with the women in his life.

He noted that \"you can't really tamper\" and that the main scripting challenge was fitting \"a very anecdotal story in a structured format\". Writer [[Abhijat Joshi]] also revealed that there was no \"deliberate\" attempt to make Dutt's character sympathetic to the audience. Instead the team realised having listened to all the anecdotes conveyed by Dutt that it's a \"very engaging, incredibly fascinating\" story based on a \"conflicted person, a flawed person\" who \"deserved empathy\".

For the last one, you\u2019ll have to see the film. Hirani also revealed that he did initially get \"attracted to all the anecdotes [that Dutt was conveying]\" but soon \"realized it was not enough \u2013 we had to be able to string it all together.\" which led him to come to the conclusion that \"people need to know is his gun story [and his drug story], because it is important.

Instead Hirani questioned \"I want to know what have I whitewashed? I have shown that he had 308 girlfriends, that he was so addicted to drugs, he slept with his friend\u2019s girlfriend. Is this whitewashing?\". Joshi also commented that \"What we are bashing is a certain section which sensationalises things and uses a question mark to make things \u2018chatpata\u2019 (spicy).

It was jointly produced by Hirani and [[Vidhu Vinod Chopra]] under the banners Rajkumar Hirani Films and [[Vinod Chopra Films]] respectively. The film follows the life of [[Bollywood]] actor [[Sanjay Dutt]], his addiction with drugs, arrest for alleged [[1993 Bombay bombings#Sanjay Dutt and co-conspirators|association with the 1993 Bombay bombings]], relationship with his father, comeback in the industry, the eventual drop of charges from bombay blasts, and release after completing his jail term. [[Ranbir Kapoor]] stars as Dutt, along with an ensemble cast which features [[Paresh Rawal]], [[Vicky Kaushal]], [[Manisha Koirala]], [[Dia Mirza]], [[Sonam Kapoor]], [[Anushka Sharma]] and [[Jim Sarbh]].\n\nIn a conversation with Hirani, Dutt shared anecdotes from his life, which the former found intriguing and prompted him to make a film based on Dutt's life. It was titled ''Sanju'' after the nickname Dutt's mother [[Nargis]] used to call him. Principal photography began in January 2017 and was completed by January 2018. The film's soundtrack was composed by Rohan-Rohan and Vikram Montrose, with [[A. R. Rahman]] as a guest composer. [[Fox Star Studios]] acquired the distribution rights of the film.\n\n''Sanju'' was released worldwide on 29 June 2018. It received positive reviews from critics, who praised Kapoor and Kaushal's performance as well as Hirani's direction; some criticised its supposed image-cleansing of its protagonist. It registered the highest opening for any film released in India in 2018, and on its third day, it had the highest single day collection ever for a Hindi film in India. With a worldwide gross of over {{INRConvert|586.85|c}}, ''Sanju'' emerged as the [[List of Bollywood films of 2018#Box office collection|highest grossing Bollywood film of 2018]], the second [[List of highest domestic net collection of Hindi films|highest-earning Hindi film]] in India of all time, and one of the [[List of highest-grossing Indian films|highest-grossing Indian films]].\n\n''Sanju'' earned seven nominations at the [[64th Filmfare Awards]] including [[Filmfare Award for Best Film|Best Film]] and [[Filmfare Award for Best Director|Best Director]] for Hirani. It won [[Filmfare Award for Best Actor|Best Actor]] for Kapoor and [[Filmfare Award for Best Supporting Actor|Best Supporting Actor]] for Kaushal.\n\n== Plot ==\nThe film starts with D. N. Tripathi ([[Piyush Mishra]]), a lyricist, who writes a biography on [[Sanjay Dutt|Sanjay \"Sanju\" Dutt]], ([[Ranbir Kapoor]]), comparing him with [[Mahatma Gandhi]]. A flabbergasted Sanjay has him thrown out. The [[Supreme Court of India ]] delivers its verdict regarding the [[1993 Bombay bombings]] and sentences Dutt to five years jail term for violating the [[Arms Act, 1959]]. His wife [[Manyata Dutt]] ([[Dia Mirza]]) approaches Winnie Diaz, ([[Anushka Sharma]]) a London-based writer, to write Sanjay's biography and present his version of his life to the public. Although unwilling at first, Winnie is asked by Zubin Mistry ([[Jim Sarbh]]), a real estate builder, to not write the biography, which intrigues her. Winnie first interviews Sanjay, and his life is revealed in a flashback.\n\nSanjay's father [[Sunil Dutt]] ([[Paresh Rawal]]) plans to launch his acting career in [[Bollywood]] with the film ''[[Rocky (1981 film)|Rocky]]'' (1981). Upset over his father's controlling behaviour on set, Sanjay is encouraged by his friend Zubin \"God\" Mistry to try drugs for the first time. Sanjay soon discovers that his mother [[Nargis]] ([[Manisha Koirala]]) is suffering from cancer and is taken to New York for treatment. This incident furthers his descent into alcoholism and drug addiction. He meets Kamlesh ([[Vicky Kaushal]]), a fan of Nargis, in New York, and they become quick friends. Kamlesh manages to make Sanjay stay away from his addiction; after learning of his girlfriend Ruby's ([[Sonam Kapoor]]) fixed marriage due to his ongoing drug addiction, Sanjay relapses. Kamli convinces Ruby to register marry Sanjay; but when Ruby after realising her love for Sanjay, she agrees and comes to the registration office, only to find that he is not there and on reaching Sanjay's house realizes that he is still under the influence of drugs and decides to leave him. Nargis passes away three days before the release of ''Rocky'', which takes an emotional toll on Sanjay. Sanjay agrees to attend a rehabilitation centre in the United States, and eventually recovers with the help of his father and Kamlesh. On returning to India, he meets with 'God' his friend and beats him for selling him drugs. Sanjay realizes that he was given drugs while 'God' himself was consuming glucose.\n\nThe later part of Dutt's life is narrated by his now-estranged friend Kamlesh, who Winnie tracks down in New York.Kamlesh is at first reluctant since he has wasted many years of his life on Sanju but finally agrees to tell her the story. In the 1990s, Sanjay turns to bodybuilding and his career in Bollywood has greatly improved. After the 1992 [[Babri Masjid]] demolition, Sanjay acquires three [[AK-56]] rifles to ensure the protection of his father, who had by then ventured into politics, and sister, [[Priya Dutt]]. A [[1993 Bombay bombings|series of bombings occur]] in Bombay shortly thereafter. Sanjay is arrested in 1993 for possession of illegal arms supposedly supplied by the [[D-Company]] to be trafficked for protection during potential communal rioting after the bombings. Sanjay is convicted and sentenced to imprisonment for five years under [[Terrorist and Disruptive Activities (Prevention) Act]] (TADA), threatening his career. Indian media labels him as a terrorist, further tarnishing his public image. Believing Sanjay to be guilty, Kamlesh severs ties with him.\n\nAfter his release in 1995, Sanjay appears in a string of flops. When his popularity had begun to wane, he is forced to sign for the [[Munna Bhai|title role]] in ''[[Munna Bhai M.B.B.S.]]'' (2003) by his father, who also features in the movie. Sanjay's performance garners him the [[Filmfare Award for Best Performance in a Comic Role]] and his public image improves, making his father proud. Shortly afterwards, his father passes away. In 2006, the Bombay High Court finds Dutt guilty under the Possession of Arms Act, while not finding him to be a terrorist. In 2013, he is arrested again by the same verdict upheld by the [[Supreme Court of India]]. Sanjay convinces Winnie and Kamlesh of his innocence by blaming the media for falsely accusing him of terrorism, and is subsequently released from prison in 2016. Sanjay finds out that Winnie has completed writing his biography, titled ''Kuch Toh Log Kahenge'' ({{translation}} People will keep saying something), named after one of his father's favourite songs from the film ''[[Amar Prem]]'' (1972). He exits the jail and reunites with Kamlesh and [[Manyata Dutt|Manyata]].\n\n== Cast ==\n{{div col}}\n*[[Ranbir Kapoor]] as [[Sanjay Dutt|Sanjay \"Sanju\" Dutt]]<ref>{{cite web |last1=Correspondent |first1=HT |title=From Ranbir Kapoor to Dia Mirza, a reel vs real rundown of who plays who in Sanju |url=https://www.hindustantimes.com/bollywood/from-ranbir-kapoor-to-dia-mirza-a-reel-vs-real-rundown-of-who-plays-who-in-sanju/story-A47rLhKBYSqa35hKX3iDaN.html |website=hindustantimes.com |publisher=Hindustan Times |accessdate=24 June 2018 |date=24 June 2018 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180624051103/https://www.hindustantimes.com/bollywood/from-ranbir-kapoor-to-dia-mirza-a-reel-vs-real-rundown-of-who-plays-who-in-sanju/story-A47rLhKBYSqa35hKX3iDaN.html |archivedate=24 June 2018  }}</ref>\n*[[Paresh Rawal]] as [[Sunil Dutt]], Sanju's father<ref>{{cite web|url=http://indianexpress.com/article/entertainment/bollywood/dia-mirza-to-play-manyata-in-sanjay-dutt-bipoic-4485399|title=Sanjay Dutt biopic: Dia Mirza to play Manyata in Ranbir Kapoor film|date=21 January 2017|accessdate=25 March 2017|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170202235936/http://indianexpress.com/article/entertainment/bollywood/dia-mirza-to-play-manyata-in-sanjay-dutt-bipoic-4485399/|archivedate=2 February 2017}}</ref>\n*[[Vicky Kaushal]] as Kamlesh \"Kamli\" Kanhaiyalal Kapasi, Sanju's best friend\n*[[Sonam Kapoor]] as Ruby (Tina Munim) \n*[[Dia Mirza]] as [[Manyata Dutt]], Sanju's wife\n*[[Manisha Koirala]] as [[Nargis]], Sanju's mother<ref name=\"MensXP cast\" /><ref name=\"Firstpost cast\">{{cite web|url=http://www.firstpost.com/entertainment/rajkumar-hiranis-sanjay-dutt-biopic-has-a-stellar-ensemble-cast-to-watch-out-for-3208020.html|title=Rajkumar Hirani's Sanjay Dutt biopic has a stellar ensemble cast to watch out for|date=17 January 2017|accessdate=25 March 2017|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170429162423/http://www.firstpost.com/entertainment/rajkumar-hiranis-sanjay-dutt-biopic-has-a-stellar-ensemble-cast-to-watch-out-for-3208020.html|archivedate=29 April 2017}}</ref>\n*[[Anushka Sharma]] as Winnie Dias, a biographer<ref name=\"auto\">{{cite web |last1=Correspondent |first1=HT |title=At Sanju's trailer launch, the mystery behind Anushka Sharma's role revealed |url=https://www.hindustantimes.com/bollywood/at-sanju-s-trailer-launch-the-mystery-behind-anushka-sharma-s-role-revealed/story-L05jRl2CgfAUdNokVY2gIK.html |website=hindustantimes.com |accessdate=30 May 2018 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180530233315/https://www.hindustantimes.com/bollywood/at-sanju-s-trailer-launch-the-mystery-behind-anushka-sharma-s-role-revealed/story-L05jRl2CgfAUdNokVY2gIK.html |archivedate=30 May 2018  }}</ref>\n*[[Jim Sarbh]] as Zubin \"GOD\" Mistry.<ref name=\"India.com cast\">{{cite web|url=http://www.india.com/showbiz/anushka-sharma-sonam-kapoor-jim-sarbh-dia-mirza-to-join-ranbir-kapoor-starrer-sanjay-dutt-biopic-cast-1761087|title=Anushka Sharma, Sonam bewafa hain Kapoor, Jim Sarbh, Dia Mirza to join Ranbir Kapoor starrer Sanjay Dutt Biopic cast!|last=Kulkarni|first=Prachi|date=15 January 2017|accessdate=25 March 2017|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170429101009/http://www.india.com/showbiz/anushka-sharma-sonam-kapoor-jim-sarbh-dia-mirza-to-join-ranbir-kapoor-starrer-sanjay-dutt-biopic-cast-1761087/|archivedate=29 April 2017}}</ref>\n*[[Karishma Tanna]] as Pinky.<ref name=\"MensXP cast\">{{Cite news|url=http://m.mensxp.com/entertainment/gossip/35784-the-cast-of-sanjay-dutt-rsquo-s-biopic-has-been-revealed-and-it-rsquo-s-so-perfect-we-can-rsquo-t-wait-for-the-film.html|title=The Cast Of Sanjay Dutt's Biopic Has Been Revealed And It's So Perfect We Can't Wait For The Film|last=Sen|first=Neil W.|work=www.mensxp.com|access-date=25 March 2017}}</ref>\n*[[Boman Irani]] as Jayaram Joshi, Ruby's father (He also appears as Dr. Asthana of [[Munna Bhai MBBS]] in archive footage)<ref>{{cite web |last1=Sharma |first1=Dipti |title=Boman Irani on Sanjay Dutt biopic: There are certain stories only Rajkumar Hirani can tell |url=https://indianexpress.com/article/entertainment/bollywood/boman-irani-on-sanjay-dutt-biopic-they-are-certain-stories-only-rajkumar-hirani-can-tell-4739977/ |website=indianexpress.com |publisher=Indian Express |accessdate=17 June 2018 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170911002514/http://indianexpress.com/article/entertainment/bollywood/boman-irani-on-sanjay-dutt-biopic-they-are-certain-stories-only-rajkumar-hirani-can-tell-4739977/ |archivedate=11 September 2017  }}</ref>\n*[[Sayaji Shinde]] as Bandu Dada\n*[[Piyush Mishra]] as D.N.

He stated that \"It will talk about human flaws, the emotional father-son story (between Sanjay and the late Sunil Dutt), his relationship with his best friend, with the women in his life. It's emotional, it's funny, it's sad, it's bittersweet.

He noted that \"you can't really tamper\" and that the main scripting challenge was fitting \"a very anecdotal story in a structured format\". Writer [[Abhijat Joshi]] also revealed that there was no \"deliberate\" attempt to make Dutt's character sympathetic to the audience. Instead the team realised having listened to all the anecdotes conveyed by Dutt that it's a \"very engaging, incredibly fascinating\" story based on a \"conflicted person, a flawed person\" who \"deserved empathy\".

Hirani also revealed that he did initially get \"attracted to all the anecdotes [that Dutt was conveying]\" but soon \"realized it was not enough \u2013 we had to be able to string it all together.\" which led him to come to the conclusion that \"people need to know is his gun story [and his drug story], because it is important.

The city is located in an eponymous [[Dhaka District|district]] and [[Dhaka Division|division]].\n\nThe area of Dhaka has been inhabited since the first millennium. The city rose to prominence in the 17th century as a provincial capital and commercial center of the [[Mughal Empire]] in South Asia. Dhaka was the capital of the [[proto-industrialization|proto-industrialised]] [[Mughal Bengal]] for 75 years. As the center of the [[muslin trade in Bengal]], it was one of the most prosperous cities in the [[Indian subcontinent]]. The medieval city was named Jahangirabad in honor of the Mughal Emperor [[Jahangir]] and hosted the seat of the Mughal [[Subahdar]] (governor), [[Naib Nazim of Dhaka|Naib Nazims]] and [[Dewan]]s (prime ministers). Medieval Dhaka's glory peaked in the 17th and 18th centuries, when it was home to merchants from across [[Eurasia]]. The Mughals decorated the city with well-laid out gardens, tombs, mosques, palaces and forts. The city was once called the ''[[Venice of the East]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pj8cderhbr8C&pg=PA57|title=Cities and Natural Process: A Basis for Sustainability|first=Michael|last=Hough|date=1 January 2004|publisher=Psychology Press}}</ref> Under the [[British Empire]], the city saw the introduction of [[electricity]], [[railway]]s, cinemas, Western-style universities and colleges and a modern water supply.

The city rose to prominence in the 17th century as a provincial capital and commercial center of the [[Mughal Empire]] in South Asia. Dhaka was the capital of the [[proto-industrialization|proto-industrialised]] [[Mughal Bengal]] for 75 years. As the center of the [[muslin trade in Bengal]], it was one of the most prosperous cities in the [[Indian subcontinent]]. The medieval city was named Jahangirabad in honor of the Mughal Emperor [[Jahangir]] and hosted the seat of the Mughal [[Subahdar]] (governor), [[Naib Nazim of Dhaka|Naib Nazims]] and [[Dewan]]s (prime ministers). Medieval Dhaka's glory peaked in the 17th and 18th centuries, when it was home to merchants from across [[Eurasia]]. The Mughals decorated the city with well-laid out gardens, tombs, mosques, palaces and forts. The city was once called the ''[[Venice of the East]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pj8cderhbr8C&pg=PA57|title=Cities and Natural Process: A Basis for Sustainability|first=Michael|last=Hough|date=1 January 2004|publisher=Psychology Press}}</ref> Under the [[British Empire]], the city saw the introduction of [[electricity]], [[railway]]s, cinemas, Western-style universities and colleges and a modern water supply.

[[Horse racing]] was a favorite pastime for elite residents in the city's Ramna Race Course beside the [[Dhaka Club]]. The [[Viceroy of India]] would often dine and entertain with Bengali aristocrats in the city.

Dhaka's urban population increased dramatically because of Muslim migration from across Bengal and other parts of the subcontinent.<ref>http://www.cdrb.org/journal/2003/3/3.pdf</ref> Dhaka began to see rapid urban expansion from the 1950s.

The [[Southeast Asia Treaty Organization]] established a research center (now called [[ICDDR,B]]) for combating disease in 1960.\n\nAs early as 1947, there were demands for Dhaka to host the parliament of the federation of Pakistan. [[Shaista Suhrawardy Ikramullah]] stated that the country's Constituent Assembly should meet in East Bengal due to the region's large population. In 1962, President [[Ayub Khan (President of Pakistan)|Ayub Khan]] designated Dhaka as the seat of the proposed National Assembly outlined in the 1962 Constitution. The government appointed [[Louis Kahn]] and [[Muzharul Islam]] to design a capitol complex in Dhaka.

He is the lead guitarist of the rock band [[Queen (band)|Queen]]. His songs include \"[[We Will Rock You]]\", \"[[Tie Your Mother Down]]\", \"[[I Want It All (Queen song)|I Want It All]]\", \"[[Fat Bottomed Girls]]\", \"[[Flash (Queen song)|Flash]]\", \"[[Hammer to Fall]]\", \"[[Save Me (Queen song)|Save Me]]\", \"[[Who Wants to Live Forever]]\" and \"[[The Show Must Go On (Queen song)|The Show Must Go On]]\".\n\nMay was a co-founder of Queen with lead singer [[Freddie Mercury]] and drummer [[Roger Taylor (Queen drummer)|Roger Taylor]], having previously performed with Taylor in the band [[Smile (band)|Smile]], which he had joined while he was at university. Within five years of their formation in 1970 and the recruitment of bass player [[John Deacon]] completing the lineup, Queen had become one of the biggest rock bands in the world with the success of the album ''[[A Night at the Opera (Queen album)|A Night at the Opera]]'' and its single \"[[Bohemian Rhapsody]]\". From the mid-1970s until the early 1990s, Queen were an almost constant presence in the UK charts and played some of the biggest venues in the world, most notably giving an acclaimed performance at [[Live Aid]] in 1985.

May brought guitarist [[Jamie Moses]] on board to replace Mike Caswell. The backing vocalists, Ryder, Stockley and Thompson, were replaced by [[Catherine Porter]] and [[Shelley Preston]]. On 23&nbsp;February 1993, this new line-up of The Brian May Band began its world tour in the US, both supporting [[Guns N' Roses]] and headlining a few dates.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ultimatequeen.co.uk/live/brian.htm#1993bttlnorthamerica1|title=1993 Back To The Light North American Tour (1st leg)|publisher=Ultimatequeen.co.uk|accessdate=27 September 2014}}</ref> The tour included dates in North America, Europe (support act: Valentine) and Japan.

May subsequently changed the approach from covers to focus on those collaborations and on new material. The songs included ''[[Another World (Brian May album)|Another World]]'', and featured mainly [[Spike Edney]], Cozy Powell, Neil Murray and Jamie Moses. On 5&nbsp;April 1998, Cozy Powell was killed in a car accident on the [[M4 motorway]] near [[Bristol]], England. This caused huge unexpected disruption to the upcoming tour for The Brian May Band which now needed a new drummer on short notice. [[Steve Ferrone]] was brought on to help May finish recording the drum tracks and to join the band for the early stage promotional tour of five dates in Europe before the world tour. Following the early promotional tour, [[Eric Singer]] replaced him on the full 1998 world tour.\n\nThe 1998 tour saw the brief introduction of a 'support act' known as T. E. Conway.  Conway (Brian May in a wig and colourful suit playing the part of a [[teddy boy]] crooner) would play a number of 1950s [[rock and roll]] standards prior to May's 'arrival'.  A bonus T. E.

While May and his father were building the Red Special, May also produced plans to build a second guitar. However, the Red Special was so successful that May had no need to build another guitar.<ref name=\"The Spade\"/> These plans were eventually given to guitar [[luthier]] Andrew Guyton in around 2004/05, some slight modifications were made and the guitar was built. It was named \"The Spade\", as the shape of the body resembled the form shown on playing cards. However, the guitar also came to be known as \"The Guitar That Time Forgot\".<ref name=\"The Spade\">{{cite web|url=http://www.guytonguitars.com/the-spade-guitar.html|title=The 'Spade' guitar|website=Guyton Guitars|accessdate=6 April 2018}}</ref>\n\nMay commented on the Red Special:\n\n{{quote|I like a big neck \u2013 thick, flat and wide.

''Queen in Their Own Words''. p.62. Omnibus Press, 1992</ref>}}\n\nIn addition to using his home-made guitar he prefers to use coins (especially [[Sixpence (British coin)|a sixpence]] from the farewell proof set of 1970), instead of a more traditional plastic [[plectrum]], because he feels their rigidity gives him more control in playing.<ref name=\"Jackson\"/> He is known to carry coins in his pockets specifically for this purpose.<ref name=\"Jackson\">Laura Jackson (2011).

Examples are found in Queen's albums ''A Night at the Opera'' and ''A Day at the Races'', where he arranged a jazz band for guitar mini-orchestra (\"Good Company\"), a vocal canon (\"The Prophet's Song\") and guitar and vocal counterpoints (\"[[Teo Torriatte]]\").\n\nMay explored a wide variety of styles in guitar, including: [[sweep picking]] (\"[[Was It All Worth It]]\" \"Chinese Torture\"); [[tremolo]] (\"Brighton Rock\", \"[[Stone Cold Crazy]]\", \"[[Death on Two Legs (Dedicated to...)|Death on Two Legs]]\", \"[[Sweet Lady (Queen song)|Sweet Lady]]\", \"Bohemian Rhapsody\", \"[[Get Down Make Love]]\", \"[[Dragon Attack]]\"); [[tapping]] (\"[[Bijou (Queen song)|Bijou]]\", \"[[It's Late]]\", \"[[Resurrection]]\", \"Cyborg\", \"Rain Must Fall\", \"Business\", \"China Belle\", \"I Was Born To Love You\"); slide guitar (\"Drowse\", \"Tie Your Mother Down\"); [[Jimi Hendrix|Hendrix]] sounding licks (\"[[Liar (Queen song)|Liar]]\", \"Brighton Rock\"); tape-delay (\"Brighton Rock\", \"White Man\"); and melodic sequences (\"Bohemian Rhapsody\", \"[[Killer Queen]]\", \"These Are the Days of Our Lives\"). Some of his solos and orchestral parts were composed by [[Freddie Mercury]], who then asked May to bring them to life (\"Bicycle Race\", \"Lazing on a Sunday Afternoon\", \"Killer Queen\", \"[[Good Old Fashioned Lover Boy]]\"). May also performed notable acoustic works, including the finger-picked solo of \"White Queen\" (from ''[[Queen II]]''),  \"[[Love of My Life (Queen song)|Love of My Life]]\" and the [[skiffle]]-influenced \"'39\" (both from ''A Night at the Opera'').\n\nAided by the uniqueness of the Red Special, May was often able to create strange and unusual sound effects. For example, he was able to imitate an orchestra in the song \"[[Queen II#Procession|Procession]]\"; in \"[[Get Down, Make Love]]\" he was able to create various sound effects with his guitar; in \"Good Company\" he used his guitar to mimic a trombone, a piccolo and several other instruments for the song's Dixieland jazz band feel. Queen used a \"No synthesizers were used on this album\" sleeve note on their early albums to make this clear to the listeners.<ref>Cunningham, Mark (October 1995).

However, the solid body construction (the original RS has hollow cavities in the body) and the pick-ups (DiMarzio) that were not an exact replica of the Burns TriSonic did not make May happy, so the production stopped after just 300&nbsp;guitars. In 1993, Guild made a second replica of the RS, made in just 1000&nbsp;copies, of which May has some and used as a back-up. At the moment, he uses the two guitars made by Greg Fryer\u2014the luthier who restored the Old Lady in 1998\u2014as back-up.

He always used a [[treble booster]] which, along with the AC30 and his custom '[[Deacy Amp]]' transistor amp, built by Queen bass player John Deacon, went a long way in helping to create many of his signature guitar tones.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://queenwillrockyou.weebly.com/deacy-amp.html|title=The Legendary Deacy Amp|publisher=queenwillrockyou.weebly.com}}</ref> He used the Dallas Rangemaster for the first Queen albums, up to ''[[A Day at the Races (album)|A Day at the Races]]''. Effects designer [[Pete Cornish]] built for him the TB-83 (32&nbsp;dB of gain) that was used for all the remaining Queen albums. He switched in 2000 to the Fryer's booster, which actually gives less boost than the TB-83.\n\nWhen performing live, May uses banks of Vox&nbsp;AC30 amplifiers, keeping some amps with only guitar and others with all effects such as delay, [[flanger]] and chorus. He has a rack of 14&nbsp;AC30s, which are grouped as Normal, Chorus, Delay&nbsp;1, Delay&nbsp;2. On his pedal board, May has a custom switch unit made by Cornish and subsequently modified by Fryer that allows him to choose which amps are active. He uses a [[Boss Corporation|BOSS]] pedal from the '70s, the Chorus Ensemble CE-1, which can be heard in \"[[Sheer Heart Attack|In The Lap of The Gods]]\" (''[[Live at Wembley '86]]'') or \"Hammer to Fall\" (slow version played live with P.&nbsp;Rodgers). Next in the chain, he uses a Foxx Foot Phaser (\"We Will Rock You\", \"We Are the Champions\", \"Keep Yourself Alive\", etc.), and two delay machines to play his trademark solo in \"Brighton Rock\".\n\n====Piano and other instruments====\nAs a child, May was trained on classical piano. Although Freddie Mercury was the band's primary pianist, May would step in occasionally (such as on \"Save Me\"<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUyPyTn-IS4 |title=Queen Save Me (Live) |website=youtube.com |url-status=live |access-date=10 April 2020}}</ref> and \"Flash\").<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://sheetmusic-free.com/flash-theme-sheet-music-queen/ |title=Flash Theme Sheet Music Queen |website=sheetmusic-free.com |url-status=live |access-date=10 April 2020}}</ref> He mostly used Freddie Mercury's 1972 Steinway piano.

He used a \"genuine [[George Formby]] Ukulele-Banjo\" in \"[[Bring Back That Leroy Brown]]\" and [[A Night at the Opera (Queen album)|\"Good Company\"]]. Occasionally, May would also record on other string instruments such as harp (one chord per take, then copied and pasted by the engineer to make it sound like a continuous performance) and bass (on some demos and many songs in his solo career, and the Queen + Paul Rodgers album). May was keen on using some toys as instruments as well. He used a [[Yamaha Corporation|Yamaha]] plastic piano in \"Teo Torriatte\"<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.ultimatequeen.co.uk/queen/songs/a-day-at-the-races.htm |title=A Day At The Races |website=ultimatequeen.co.uk |url-status=live |access-date=10 April 2020}}</ref> and a toy mini [[koto (musical instrument)|koto]] in \"The Prophet's Song\".<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=gZ5ZCgAAQBAJ&pg=PA189&lpg=PA189&dq=may+mini+koto+prophets+song&source=bl&ots=Q2wEPJDBsB&sig=ACfU3U0yjtTueqXty7NPHUjjdkv2NJqqUw&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiG3Lu70t7oAhVWG80KHSjiCoYQ6AEwCXoECBIQKw#v=onepage&q=may%20mini%20koto%20prophets%20song&f=false |title=The Bible in Music: A Dictionary of Songs, Works, and More |last=Long |first= Siobh\u00e1n Dowling  |last2=Sawyer |first2=John F.A. |website=books.google.ca |publisher=[[Rowman & Littlefield]] |page=189 |access-date=10 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n====Vocals====\nMay is also an accomplished singer. From Queen's ''[[Queen II]]'' to ''[[The Game (Queen album)|The Game]]'', May contributed lead vocals to at least one song per album. May co-composed a mini-opera with [[Lee Holdridge]], ''Il Colosso'', for [[Steve Barron]]'s 1996 film, ''[[The Adventures of Pinocchio (1996 film)|The Adventures of Pinocchio]]''.  May performed the opera with [[Jerry Hadley]], [[Sissel Kyrkjebo]], and [[Just William]].  On-screen, it was performed entirely by puppets.\n\n==Scientific career==\n[[File:Rock Star and Astrophysicist Brian May Visits Paranal.jpg|thumbnail|May in 2015 at [[Paranal Observatory]]]]\n{{See also|List of celebrities with advanced degrees}}\nMay studied physics and mathematics at Imperial College London, graduating with a BSc (Hons) degree and [[Associate of the Royal College of Science|ARCS]] in physics with [[Second-class honours|Upper Second-Class Honours]].

Harold May''', {{post-nominals|country=GBR|size=100%|CBE}} (born 19 July 1947) is an English musician, singer, songwriter and astrophysicist. He is the lead guitarist of the rock band [[Queen (band)|Queen]]. His songs include \"[[We Will Rock You]]\", \"[[Tie Your Mother Down]]\", \"[[I Want It All (Queen song)|I Want It All]]\", \"[[Fat Bottomed Girls]]\", \"[[Flash (Queen song)|Flash]]\", \"[[Hammer to Fall]]\", \"[[Save Me (Queen song)|Save Me]]\", \"[[Who Wants to Live Forever]]\" and \"[[The Show Must Go On (Queen song)|The Show Must Go On]]\".\n\nMay was a co-founder of Queen with lead singer [[Freddie Mercury]] and drummer [[Roger Taylor (Queen drummer)|Roger Taylor]], having previously performed with Taylor in the band [[Smile (band)|Smile]], which he had joined while he was at university. Within five years of their formation in 1970 and the recruitment of bass player [[John Deacon]] completing the lineup, Queen had become one of the biggest rock bands in the world with the success of the album ''[[A Night at the Opera (Queen album)|A Night at the Opera]]'' and its single \"[[Bohemian Rhapsody]]\". From the mid-1970s until the early 1990s, Queen were an almost constant presence in the UK charts and played some of the biggest venues in the world, most notably giving an acclaimed performance at [[Live Aid]] in 1985. As a member of Queen, May became regarded as a virtuoso musician and he was identified with a distinctive sound created through his layered guitar work, often using a home-built electric guitar called the [[Red Special]].<ref name=redspecial>{{cite book |last1=May|first1=Brian |authorlink1= Brian May|last2=Bradley |first2=Simon |title=Brian May's Red Special  |date=2014 |publisher=Prion Books |isbn=978-1-78097-276-3 }}</ref>\n\nFollowing the death of Mercury in 1991, aside from the [[The Freddie Mercury Tribute Concert|1992 tribute concert]], the release of ''[[Made in Heaven]]'' (1995) and the 1997 tribute single to Mercury, \"[[No-One but You (Only the Good Die Young)]]\" (written by May), Queen were put on hiatus for several years but were eventually reconvened by May and Taylor for further performances featuring other vocalists.

May subsequently changed the approach from covers to focus on those collaborations and on new material. The songs included ''[[Another World (Brian May album)|Another World]]'', and featured mainly [[Spike Edney]], Cozy Powell, Neil Murray and Jamie Moses. On 5&nbsp;April 1998, Cozy Powell was killed in a car accident on the [[M4 motorway]] near [[Bristol]], England. This caused huge unexpected disruption to the upcoming tour for The Brian May Band which now needed a new drummer on short notice. [[Steve Ferrone]] was brought on to help May finish recording the drum tracks and to join the band for the early stage promotional tour of five dates in Europe before the world tour. Following the early promotional tour, [[Eric Singer]] replaced him on the full 1998 world tour.\n\nThe 1998 tour saw the brief introduction of a 'support act' known as T. E. Conway.  Conway (Brian May in a wig and colourful suit playing the part of a [[teddy boy]] crooner) would play a number of 1950s [[rock and roll]] standards prior to May's 'arrival'.  A bonus T. E. Conway EP entitled ''Retro Rock Special'' was attached to some pressings of the ''Another World'' album.  The Conway character was retired at the end of the tour.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/music/artists/brian-may-guide-queen-guitarists-eccentricities-obessions/|first=Adam|last=White|title=From badgers to flamboyant alter egos: a guide to the strange obsessions of Queen's Brian May|date=19 July 2017|newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]]}}</ref>\nIn May 1999, May recorded lead guitars for the Guns N' Roses song \"Catcher in the Rye\" on ''[[Chinese Democracy]]'', however, his performance was removed from the album by the time it was released in 2008.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2008/nov/07/brian-may-chinese-democracy|title=Brian May dropped from Guns N' Roses album|last=Anthony|first=James|date=7 November 2008|website=[[The Guardian]]}}</ref>\n\n===2000\u20132010===\n[[File:Queen 2005 1010016.JPG|thumb|May performing in Frankfurt in 2005.]]\nFrom his last solo release in 1998, May has been performing as a solo artist, as part of an ensemble, and infrequently as Queen with Roger Taylor.

While May and his father were building the Red Special, May also produced plans to build a second guitar. However, the Red Special was so successful that May had no need to build another guitar.<ref name=\"The Spade\"/> These plans were eventually given to guitar [[luthier]] Andrew Guyton in around 2004/05, some slight modifications were made and the guitar was built. It was named \"The Spade\", as the shape of the body resembled the form shown on playing cards. However, the guitar also came to be known as \"The Guitar That Time Forgot\".<ref name=\"The Spade\">{{cite web|url=http://www.guytonguitars.com/the-spade-guitar.html|title=The 'Spade' guitar|website=Guyton Guitars|accessdate=6 April 2018}}</ref>\n\nMay commented on the Red Special:\n\n{{quote|I like a big neck \u2013 thick, flat and wide.

''Queen in Their Own Words''. p.62. Omnibus Press, 1992</ref>}}\n\nIn addition to using his home-made guitar he prefers to use coins (especially [[Sixpence (British coin)|a sixpence]] from the farewell proof set of 1970), instead of a more traditional plastic [[plectrum]], because he feels their rigidity gives him more control in playing.<ref name=\"Jackson\"/> He is known to carry coins in his pockets specifically for this purpose.<ref name=\"Jackson\">Laura Jackson (2011).

Examples are found in Queen's albums ''A Night at the Opera'' and ''A Day at the Races'', where he arranged a jazz band for guitar mini-orchestra (\"Good Company\"), a vocal canon (\"The Prophet's Song\") and guitar and vocal counterpoints (\"[[Teo Torriatte]]\").\n\nMay explored a wide variety of styles in guitar, including: [[sweep picking]] (\"[[Was It All Worth It]]\" \"Chinese Torture\"); [[tremolo]] (\"Brighton Rock\", \"[[Stone Cold Crazy]]\", \"[[Death on Two Legs (Dedicated to...)|Death on Two Legs]]\", \"[[Sweet Lady (Queen song)|Sweet Lady]]\", \"Bohemian Rhapsody\", \"[[Get Down Make Love]]\", \"[[Dragon Attack]]\"); [[tapping]] (\"[[Bijou (Queen song)|Bijou]]\", \"[[It's Late]]\", \"[[Resurrection]]\", \"Cyborg\", \"Rain Must Fall\", \"Business\", \"China Belle\", \"I Was Born To Love You\"); slide guitar (\"Drowse\", \"Tie Your Mother Down\"); [[Jimi Hendrix|Hendrix]] sounding licks (\"[[Liar (Queen song)|Liar]]\", \"Brighton Rock\"); tape-delay (\"Brighton Rock\", \"White Man\"); and melodic sequences (\"Bohemian Rhapsody\", \"[[Killer Queen]]\", \"These Are the Days of Our Lives\"). Some of his solos and orchestral parts were composed by [[Freddie Mercury]], who then asked May to bring them to life (\"Bicycle Race\", \"Lazing on a Sunday Afternoon\", \"Killer Queen\", \"[[Good Old Fashioned Lover Boy]]\"). May also performed notable acoustic works, including the finger-picked solo of \"White Queen\" (from ''[[Queen II]]''),  \"[[Love of My Life (Queen song)|Love of My Life]]\" and the [[skiffle]]-influenced \"'39\" (both from ''A Night at the Opera'').\n\nAided by the uniqueness of the Red Special, May was often able to create strange and unusual sound effects. For example, he was able to imitate an orchestra in the song \"[[Queen II#Procession|Procession]]\"; in \"[[Get Down, Make Love]]\" he was able to create various sound effects with his guitar; in \"Good Company\" he used his guitar to mimic a trombone, a piccolo and several other instruments for the song's Dixieland jazz band feel. Queen used a \"No synthesizers were used on this album\" sleeve note on their early albums to make this clear to the listeners.<ref>Cunningham, Mark (October 1995).

However, the solid body construction (the original RS has hollow cavities in the body) and the pick-ups (DiMarzio) that were not an exact replica of the Burns TriSonic did not make May happy, so the production stopped after just 300&nbsp;guitars. In 1993, Guild made a second replica of the RS, made in just 1000&nbsp;copies, of which May has some and used as a back-up. At the moment, he uses the two guitars made by Greg Fryer\u2014the luthier who restored the Old Lady in 1998\u2014as back-up.

He always used a [[treble booster]] which, along with the AC30 and his custom '[[Deacy Amp]]' transistor amp, built by Queen bass player John Deacon, went a long way in helping to create many of his signature guitar tones.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://queenwillrockyou.weebly.com/deacy-amp.html|title=The Legendary Deacy Amp|publisher=queenwillrockyou.weebly.com}}</ref> He used the Dallas Rangemaster for the first Queen albums, up to ''[[A Day at the Races (album)|A Day at the Races]]''. Effects designer [[Pete Cornish]] built for him the TB-83 (32&nbsp;dB of gain) that was used for all the remaining Queen albums. He switched in 2000 to the Fryer's booster, which actually gives less boost than the TB-83.\n\nWhen performing live, May uses banks of Vox&nbsp;AC30 amplifiers, keeping some amps with only guitar and others with all effects such as delay, [[flanger]] and chorus. He has a rack of 14&nbsp;AC30s, which are grouped as Normal, Chorus, Delay&nbsp;1, Delay&nbsp;2. On his pedal board, May has a custom switch unit made by Cornish and subsequently modified by Fryer that allows him to choose which amps are active. He uses a [[Boss Corporation|BOSS]] pedal from the '70s, the Chorus Ensemble CE-1, which can be heard in \"[[Sheer Heart Attack|In The Lap of The Gods]]\" (''[[Live at Wembley '86]]'') or \"Hammer to Fall\" (slow version played live with P.&nbsp;Rodgers). Next in the chain, he uses a Foxx Foot Phaser (\"We Will Rock You\", \"We Are the Champions\", \"Keep Yourself Alive\", etc.), and two delay machines to play his trademark solo in \"Brighton Rock\".\n\n====Piano and other instruments====\nAs a child, May was trained on classical piano. Although Freddie Mercury was the band's primary pianist, May would step in occasionally (such as on \"Save Me\"<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUyPyTn-IS4 |title=Queen Save Me (Live) |website=youtube.com |url-status=live |access-date=10 April 2020}}</ref> and \"Flash\").<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://sheetmusic-free.com/flash-theme-sheet-music-queen/ |title=Flash Theme Sheet Music Queen |website=sheetmusic-free.com |url-status=live |access-date=10 April 2020}}</ref> He mostly used Freddie Mercury's 1972 Steinway piano.

He used a \"genuine [[George Formby]] Ukulele-Banjo\" in \"[[Bring Back That Leroy Brown]]\" and [[A Night at the Opera (Queen album)|\"Good Company\"]]. Occasionally, May would also record on other string instruments such as harp (one chord per take, then copied and pasted by the engineer to make it sound like a continuous performance) and bass (on some demos and many songs in his solo career, and the Queen + Paul Rodgers album). May was keen on using some toys as instruments as well. He used a [[Yamaha Corporation|Yamaha]] plastic piano in \"Teo Torriatte\"<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.ultimatequeen.co.uk/queen/songs/a-day-at-the-races.htm |title=A Day At The Races |website=ultimatequeen.co.uk |url-status=live |access-date=10 April 2020}}</ref> and a toy mini [[koto (musical instrument)|koto]] in \"The Prophet's Song\".<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=gZ5ZCgAAQBAJ&pg=PA189&lpg=PA189&dq=may+mini+koto+prophets+song&source=bl&ots=Q2wEPJDBsB&sig=ACfU3U0yjtTueqXty7NPHUjjdkv2NJqqUw&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiG3Lu70t7oAhVWG80KHSjiCoYQ6AEwCXoECBIQKw#v=onepage&q=may%20mini%20koto%20prophets%20song&f=false |title=The Bible in Music: A Dictionary of Songs, Works, and More |last=Long |first= Siobh\u00e1n Dowling  |last2=Sawyer |first2=John F.A. |website=books.google.ca |publisher=[[Rowman & Littlefield]] |page=189 |access-date=10 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n====Vocals====\nMay is also an accomplished singer. From Queen's ''[[Queen II]]'' to ''[[The Game (Queen album)|The Game]]'', May contributed lead vocals to at least one song per album. May co-composed a mini-opera with [[Lee Holdridge]], ''Il Colosso'', for [[Steve Barron]]'s 1996 film, ''[[The Adventures of Pinocchio (1996 film)|The Adventures of Pinocchio]]''.  May performed the opera with [[Jerry Hadley]], [[Sissel Kyrkjebo]], and [[Just William]].  On-screen, it was performed entirely by puppets.\n\n==Scientific career==\n[[File:Rock Star and Astrophysicist Brian May Visits Paranal.jpg|thumbnail|May in 2015 at [[Paranal Observatory]]]]\n{{See also|List of celebrities with advanced degrees}}\nMay studied physics and mathematics at Imperial College London, graduating with a BSc (Hons) degree and [[Associate of the Royal College of Science|ARCS]] in physics with [[Second-class honours|Upper Second-Class Honours]].

Most patients with paralysis of the breathing muscles use modern [[mechanical ventilation|mechanical ventilators]] that push air into the airway with positive pressure. These are generally efficacious and have the advantage of not restricting patients' movements or caregivers' ability to examine the patients as significantly as an iron lung does.

Most patients with paralysis of the breathing muscles use modern [[mechanical ventilation|mechanical ventilators]] that push air into the airway with positive pressure. These are generally efficacious and have the advantage of not restricting patients' movements or caregivers' ability to examine the patients as significantly as an iron lung does. However, [[wikt:negative pressure|negative pressure]] ventilation is a truer approximation of normal physiological breathing and results in more normal distribution of air in the lungs. It may also be preferable in certain rare conditions, such as [[central hypoventilation syndrome]], in which failure of the medullary respiratory centers at the base of the brain results in patients having no [[Autonomic nervous system|autonomic control]] of breathing. At least one reported polio patient, [[Dianne Odell]], had a spinal deformity that caused the use of mechanical ventilators to be [[contraindicated]].<ref name=Sydney2008>{{cite news|author=|title=Power failure kills iron lung lady|work=The Sydney Morning Herald|date=2008-05-29|url=https://www.smh.com.au/news/world/power-failure-kills-iron-lung-lady/2008/05/29/1211654160059.html|accessdate=2011-07-01}}</ref> There are patients who today still use the older machines, often in their homes, despite the occasional difficulty of finding the various replacement parts.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nbcnews.com/health/60-years-iron-lung-us-polio-survivor-worries-about-new-2D11641456|title=60 years in an iron lung: US polio survivor worries about new global threat|publisher=}}</ref> Joan Headley of [[Post-Polio Health International]] said that as of May 28, 2008, there were about 30 patients in the U.S. still using an iron lung.<ref name=CNN2008>{{cite news|title=Woman dies after life spent in iron lung |date=May 28, 2008 |url=http://www.cnn.com/2008/US/05/28/iron.lung.death.ap/index.html |accessdate=2011-07-01 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081022162511/http://www.cnn.com/2008/US/05/28/iron.lung.death.ap/index.html |archivedate=October 22, 2008 }}</ref> That figure may be inaccurately low; [[Houston, Texas|Houston]] alone had 19 iron lung patients living at home in 2008.<ref name=Neergaard2009>{{cite news|author=Lauran Neergaard|title=Emergency officials struggle to find those on life-support during power outages|date=2009-01-13|url=http://www.ems1.com/survivability/articles/447100-Emergency-officials-struggle-to-find-those-on-life-support-during-power-outages|accessdate=2014-01-01}}</ref> [[Martha Mason (writer)|Martha Mason]] of [[Lattimore, North Carolina]], died on May 4, 2009, after spending 60 of her 72 years in an iron lung.<ref name=Fox2009>{{cite news|last=Fox|first=Margalit|title=Martha Mason, Who Wrote Book About Her Decades in an Iron Lung, Dies at 71|work=The New York Times|date=2009-05-10|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/10/us/10mason.html?_r=1&scp=1&sq=iron%20lung&st=cse|accessdate=2011-07-01}}</ref>\n\nOn 30 October 2009, [[June Middleton]] of [[Melbourne, Australia]], who had been entered in the ''[[Guinness Book of Records]]'' as the person who spent the longest time in an iron lung, died aged 83, having spent more than 60 years in her iron lung.<ref name=Sydney2009>{{cite news|author=|title=Dead after 60 years in iron lung|work=The Sydney Morning Herald|date=2009-11-01|url=https://www.smh.com.au/national/dead-after-60-years-in-iron-lung-20091101-hqyy.html?autostart=1|accessdate=2011-07-01}}</ref>\n\nIn 2013, the [[Post-Polio Health International]] (PHI) organizations estimated that there were only six to eight iron lung users in the United States; as of 2017 its executive director knew of none.
