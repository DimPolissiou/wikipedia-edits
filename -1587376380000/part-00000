Known as \"The Little Tiger,\" Barry held the World Bantamweight Championship from 1894 to 1899 and retired undefeated.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cyberboxingzone.com/boxing/bantam.htm|title=The Lineal Bantamweight Champions|publisher=Cyber Boxing Zone}}</ref>  He was inducted into the Ring Magazine Hall of Fame in 2000.<ref name=CBZ>{{cite web|url=http://www.cyberboxingzone.com/boxing/barry-j.htm|title=Jimmy Barry Boxing Record|website=Cyber Boxing Zone}}</ref>\n\n==Career==\nBarry was born in Goose Island on the North side of Chicago on March 7, 1870 to father Garrett, and mother Mary.  He learned to box in rough school boy bouts, but trained for the profession in earnest by thirteen when he began taking lessons at McGurn's Handball Courts in Chicago.  He soon came under the tutelage of former featherweight title claimant Harry Gilmore who was impressed with his two handed power and knowledge of fundamentals. An exceptional trainer, Gilmore also had future bantamweight champion [[Harry Forbes]] as a disciple during this period.  When Barry's father died in 1885, Gilmore started him on his amateur career at fifteen.  In 1891 Barry knocked out Jack Larson, who had more experience and a weight advantage of ten pounds.  Not long after his win, Barry came under the management of Charles \"Parson\" Davies, who was hoping to mold his protege into the new bantamweight champion.  Barry turned professional under Davies's assistance by 1890, and fought extensively in that year and the next, though many of his bouts were exhibitions.<ref name=IBHOF/><ref>Mastro Frank, \"Jimmy Barry Whips a Foe\", ''Chicago Tribune'', Chicago, Illinois, pg. 30, 7 April 1943</ref><ref>Mastro Frank, \"Barry Starts His Boxing Career Early\", ''Chicago Tribune'', Chicago, Illinois, pg. 26, 6 April 1943</ref>\n\n===World Bantam champion, 100-102 lbs.===\nIn his most significant early bout, Barry knocked out the twenty-year old London boxer Jack Levy in 17 rounds to win the 100-pound World Championship on December 5, 1893 in Roby, Indiana, though the win may not have yet been fully sanctioned by the United States.  The recognized Bantamweight limit at least at a later point in time, was 105 pounds, making his win not an official bantamweight title in all record books, though it did meet the criteria for the 100 pound bantamweight limit used at the time.<ref name=IBHOF/>\n\nShowing his championship form, on February 6, 1894, the blond Chicagoan faced future Irish bantamweight champion Joe McGrath at Chicago's Empire Theatre, knocking him down in less than a minute into the first round. Starting with a straight left, and a short right hook to the jaw, he put McGrath down hard in the first round.  After rising unsteadily, Barry knocked down McGrath twice more, before time was called for the first round with McGrath barely being able to walk to his corner.   The second was tame, but near the end of the third Barry again went at McGrath forcing him to clinch before the round ended, and a technical knockout was called when the police intervened.<ref>\"Nothing Friendly About This\", ''The Philadelphia Inquirer'', Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, pg. 3, 8 February 1894</ref><ref>Police intervened in \"McGrath and Barry Spar\", ''St. Louis Globe'', St. Louis, Missouri, pg. 9, 7 February 1894</ref> \n\nSeveral boxing historians consider Barry's first ascent to the USA Bantamweight World championship for the 102 pound class to have come after his defeat of Jimmy Gorman on June 2, 1894 at the Olympic Club New Orleans, Louisiana.  After five rounds it was evident that Barry would win the contest, and take the $1000 prize on route to a convincing eleventh round knockout before a large crowd in Olympic Arena. The win was made more significant as it was sanctioned both as a United States and World championship.<ref>\"General Sporting\", ''The Buffalo Enquirer'', Buffalo, New York, pg. 8, 4 June 1894</ref>\n\n=====Bantamweight 105 lb. title=====\nThe following year, he cemented his claim to the world bantamweight crown (the [[bantamweight]] limit at the time ranged from 100 to 112 pounds) when former bantamweight champion [[George Dixon (boxer)|George Dixon]] moved up to the [[featherweight]] class. The bantamweight division in America at the time was sometimes referred to as \"paperweight\" and was not officially established.  Barry's best known fight became his 28th-round knockout of Sicilian boxer Casper Leon before a seasoned crowd of 250 on September 15, 1894 in Lemont, Illinois, for total stakes of $4,000.  Leon would become Barry's greatest rival and his most frequent opponent.  In the 20th round, Barry, though he had received punishment to his eyes in previous rounds, landed a strong blow to the jaw of Leon, and the direction of the fight shifted.  From the 21st through 28th, Barry dealt knockdowns to Leon repeatedly, until the 28th when a final blow to Leon's jaw caused the knockout.  Barry, though he took home $800 for the win, was severely punished in the lengthy contest.  According to one source, as the weigh-in was early, the men may have fought at several pounds above the weight limit.<ref name=CBZ/><ref name=IBHOF>Roberts, James, and Skutt, Alexander,''Boxing Register'', (2006) International Boxing Hall of Fame, McBooks Press, Ithaca, New York, pgs. 64-5</ref><ref>\"New Bantam Champion\", ''The Buffalo Enquirer'', Buffalo, New York, pg. 8, 17 September 1894</ref><ref>250 in attendance in \"Fullerton, Hugh S., \"Here Fans is a Great Story of a Prize Fight\", ''Wilkes-Barre Times Leader'', Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania, pg. 12, 28 January 1915</ref><ref name=HOFwebsite>{{cite web|url=http://www.ibhof.com/pages/about/inductees/oldtimer/barry.html|title=Jimmy Barry|website=International Boxing Hall of Fame Website}}</ref> \n\nBarry faced Casper Leon a second time on March 30, 1895 for both the USA and World 105 lb. championship, and retained the title with a 14 round draw.

Barry clearly dominated the twelfth through seventeenth.  In the nineteenth, Barry made strong counters to the jaw of Anthony, who had received a series of punishing blows to his eyes in several rounds of the fight.  Barry dominated the 20th, sending repeated blows to the eyes and jaw of Anthony, and when the round ended the referee gave the decision to Barry on points.  Barry took home $1500 of a total $2000 purse. The fighters fought at 115 pounds, and though a few contemporary sources consider the fight for the bantamweight title, their weights exceeded the bantamweight limit at the time.  Barry countered Anthony's blows frequently with a straight left to the eye, and generally landed nearly twice as many blows when mixing in close quarters, dominating the infighting.<ref>The fight was for the bantamweight title in \"Jimmy Barry Defeats Anthony\", ''The Record-Union'', Sacramento, California, pg. 1, 24 April 1897</ref><ref>A scientific battle with Barry dominating the infighting in \"Jimmy Anthony Was Outclassed\", ''The San Francisco Call'', San Francisco, California, pg. 7, 24 April 1897</ref>\n\n====Bantamweight 110 lb. title====\nOn December 6, 1897, Barry scored a 20th-round knockout with a crushing right to the jaw against English champion Walter Croot in [[London, England|London]], giving him claim to the vacant 110 pound World championship.  Barry had taken a lead in the scoring through the 20th round, but Croot had nearly evened the contest by the 19th when Barry landed a series of blows, taking the fight to Croot, continuing until the 20th when he scored the knockout with a left to the head and a right to the jaw.  Several accounts maintain that Barry was told in the late rounds he would not win the title without a knockout.<ref>[https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1897/12/08/102065575.pdf \"English Bantamweight Dies\"]</ref> Croot never regained consciousness and died the following day from a brain injury.

The Chicagoan temporarily considered retirement, but though he returned to boxing when he arrived in the United States, he did not fight with the same ferocity. Barry fought ten times after the Croot tragedy and failed to score a single knockout. On May 30, 1898, Barry fought a 20 round draw against his former rival Casper Leon in New York, retaining the World 100 pound Bantamweight Championship. Leon fought well but lacked the force to knock out Barry who remained calm and cautious throughout, but also lacked a knockout punch.<ref>Leon fight in \"Boxing at the Lennox A.C.\", ''The New York Times'', New York, New York, pg. 4, 31 May 1898</ref>\n\nBarry defeated Johnny Ritchie, a well known bantam, in Chicago on March 26, 1898 in a six round bout.  New York's ''The Sun'', however, wrote that the match was close and could have been called a draw, describing Barry's performance as \"disappointing\".  Many in the crowd felt the bout should have been called a draw, but some ringside believed Barry may have had the better of the fifth and sixth.<ref>\"Gossip of the Ring\", ''The Sun'', New York, New York, pg. 9, 29 March 1898</ref><ref>\"Barry Won the Decision\", ''Star-Gazette'', Elmira, New York, pg. 6, 28 March 1898</ref> \n\nSteve Flanagan met Barry on June 3, 1898, in a close bout that resulted in a six round draw in Philadelphia.  Flanagan had claimed the 105 pound championship a few months before the fight.  The Scranton's ''Tribune'' wrote that Flanagan may have had the best of the bout, clearly dominating the third, and landing the last solid blow in the sixth on Barry's eye.  The ''Pittsburgh Press'' also wrote that Flanagan had outpointed Barry.  The newspaper noted that Barry had forced the pace, and fought viciously but that Flanagan had countered well and done damage at the close of the sixth.<ref>\"Six Round Bout\", ''The Tribune'', Scranton, Pennsylvania, pg. 2, 4 June 1898</ref><ref>\"Around the Ring\", ''Pittsburgh Press'', Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, pg. 12, 5 June 1898</ref>  \n\n=====Last 110 lb. title match=====\nBarry faced Casper Leon again for the American and World 110 pound bantamweight championship in the late evening of December 29, 1898, and retained the title in a twenty round draw. In a close bout, Leon may have thrown a few more blows and shown scientific skills in his defense, but Barry's blows landed with greater precision and were more telling.  The early rounds showed the most intense fighting, and though Barry caught Leon particularly hard in the sixth with a left in the face and a hard blow to the head in the seventh, the fighting was close in most respects.<ref>\"Fought to a Good Draw\", ''The Buffalo Enquirer'', Buffalo, New York, pg. 4, 30 December 1898</ref>  Barry had already considered retirement and had announced it to a few in the press, though he would take another fight the following year.<ref>\"Barry and Leon Draw\", ''Sioux City Journal'', Sioux City, Iowa, pg. 2, 30 December 1898</ref><ref>\"Kissed Jimmy Barry\", ''The Pittsburgh Press'', Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, pg. 12, 1 January 1899</ref>  \n\nIn his final bout, he boxed a six-round draw with future Bantamweight champion [[Harry Harris (boxer)|Harry Harris]] on September 1, 1899.   Ringside observers believed that Harris had won, but that the referee called a draw to allow Barry to retire undefeated.  Chicago's ''Inter-Ocean'' wrote that Harris \"clearly outpointed Barry and during the last few rounds forced the fighting after a fashion that should have gained him the decision\".  The ''Chicago Tribune'' wrote that Barry was fortunate to receive a draw as Harris showed considerable skill in avoiding his blows.<ref>\"Barry Draws With Harris\", ''Inter-Ocean'', Chicago, Illinois, pg. 8, 2 September 99</ref><ref>Harris showed skill in avoiding Barry's blows in \"Barry and Harris Draw\", ''The Chicago Tribune'', Chicago, Illinois, pg. 4, 2 September 1899</ref><ref name=IBHOF/>  Through 1901, Barry fought the occasional  exhibition in Chicago, and continued to fight the occasional bout through at least 1910.<ref name=CBZ/>\n\n==Life after boxing==\nAccording to Catholic Church records, Barry married Amanda Martha Claussen in Chicago on November 26, 1902.<ref name=Grave>{{cite web|url=https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/138600742/james-curran-barry|title=James Curran Barry|website=James Curran Barry Grave Record}}</ref> \n\nDuring WWI, in 1917, Barry worked as a boxing instructor at Camp Gordon, northeast of Atlanta, Georgia.  His duties included physical and bayonet training.  WWI army boxing training was led by several exceptional feather and lightweight champions including [[Benny Leonard]], [[Packey McFarland]] and [[Johnny Kilbane]].<ref>Mastro, Frank, \"Barry Knocks Out England's New Champion\", ''Chicago Tribune'', Chicago, Illinois, pg. 27, 9 April 1943</ref>  Unable to continue as an instructor due to physical limitations, he left the Army in October of 1918.<ref>Left Army job in \"Jimmy Barry Forced to Give Up Army Job in ''Star-Gazette'', Elmira, New York, pg. 8, 26 October 1918</ref>\n\nAfter his WWI service, Barry worked in Chicago's Cook County clerk's office for 25 years until he left due to poor health.  He occasionally refereed bouts at local clubs, likely for extra income.  He died in a Chicago Sanitarium on April 5, 1943 after an illness lasting four years, that according to one source may have been tuberculosis.<ref>Possibly tuberculosis in Ward, Charles P., \"A Ward to the Wise\", ''Detroit Free Press'', Detroit, Michigan, pg. 18, 7 April 1943</ref>   After services at Immaculate Conception Church, he was buried in Calvary Cemetery, a Catholic cemetery in the Chicago suburb of Evanston.<ref name=Dies>\"Jimmy Barry, Old Champion, Dies\", ''The Decatur Daily News'', Decatur, Illinois, pg. 10, 5 April 1943</ref><ref>\"Hold Funeral Tomorrow for Jimmy Barry\", ''Chicago Tribune'', Chicago, Illinois, pg. 26, 6 April 1943</ref>\n\nAccording to the [[International Boxing Hall of Fame]], which inducted the diminutive pugilist in the Old Timer category in 2000, Barry was undefeated in 70 professional fights.

Known as \"The Little Tiger,\" Barry held the World Bantamweight Championship from 1894 to 1899 and retired undefeated.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cyberboxingzone.com/boxing/bantam.htm|title=The Lineal Bantamweight Champions|publisher=Cyber Boxing Zone}}</ref>  He was inducted into the Ring Magazine Hall of Fame in 2000.<ref name=CBZ>{{cite web|url=http://www.cyberboxingzone.com/boxing/barry-j.htm|title=Jimmy Barry Boxing Record|website=Cyber Boxing Zone}}</ref>\n\n==Career==\nBarry was born in Goose Island on the North side of Chicago on March 7, 1870 to father Garrett, and mother Mary.  He learned to box in rough school boy bouts, but trained for the profession in earnest by thirteen when he began taking lessons at McGurn's Handball Courts in Chicago.  He soon came under the tutelage of former featherweight title claimant Harry Gilmore who was impressed with his two handed power and knowledge of fundamentals. An exceptional trainer, Gilmore also had future bantamweight champion [[Harry Forbes]] as a disciple during this period.  When Barry's father died in 1885, Gilmore started him on his amateur career at fifteen.  In 1891 Barry knocked out Jack Larson, who had more experience and a weight advantage of ten pounds.  Not long after his win, Barry came under the management of Charles \"Parson\" Davies, who was hoping to mold his protege into the new bantamweight champion.  Barry turned professional under Davies's assistance by 1890, and fought extensively in that year and the next, though many of his bouts were exhibitions.<ref name=IBHOF/><ref>Mastro Frank, \"Jimmy Barry Whips a Foe\", ''Chicago Tribune'', Chicago, Illinois, pg. 30, 7 April 1943</ref><ref>Mastro Frank, \"Barry Starts His Boxing Career Early\", ''Chicago Tribune'', Chicago, Illinois, pg. 26, 6 April 1943</ref>\n\n===World Bantam champion, 100-102 lbs.===\nIn his most significant early bout, Barry knocked out the twenty-year old London boxer Jack Levy in 17 rounds to win the 100-pound World Championship on December 5, 1893 in Roby, Indiana, though the win may not have yet been fully sanctioned by the United States.  The recognized Bantamweight limit at least at a later point in time, was 105 pounds, making his win not an official bantamweight title in all record books, though it did meet the criteria for the 100 pound bantamweight limit used at the time.<ref name=IBHOF/>\n\nShowing his championship form, on February 6, 1894, the blond Chicagoan faced future Irish bantamweight champion Joe McGrath at Chicago's Empire Theatre, knocking him down in less than a minute into the first round. Starting with a straight left, and a short right hook to the jaw, he put McGrath down hard in the first round.  After rising unsteadily, Barry knocked down McGrath twice more, before time was called for the first round with McGrath barely being able to walk to his corner.

Flanagan had claimed the 105 pound championship a few months before the fight.  The Scranton's ''Tribune'' wrote that Flanagan may have had the best of the bout, clearly dominating the third, and landing the last solid blow in the sixth on Barry's eye.  The ''Pittsburgh Press'' also wrote that Flanagan had outpointed Barry.  The newspaper noted that Barry had forced the pace, and fought viciously but that Flanagan had countered well and done damage at the close of the sixth.<ref>\"Six Round Bout\", ''The Tribune'', Scranton, Pennsylvania, pg. 2, 4 June 1898</ref><ref>\"Around the Ring\", ''Pittsburgh Press'', Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, pg. 12, 5 June 1898</ref>  \n\n=====Last 110 lb. title match=====\nBarry faced Casper Leon again for the American and World 110 pound bantamweight championship in the late evening of December 29, 1898, and retained the title in a twenty round draw. In a close bout, Leon may have thrown a few more blows and shown scientific skills in his defense, but Barry's blows landed with greater precision and were more telling.  The early rounds showed the most intense fighting, and though Barry caught Leon particularly hard in the sixth with a left in the face and a hard blow to the head in the seventh, the fighting was close in most respects.<ref>\"Fought to a Good Draw\", ''The Buffalo Enquirer'', Buffalo, New York, pg. 4, 30 December 1898</ref>  Barry had already considered retirement and had announced it to a few in the press, though he would take another fight the following year.<ref>\"Barry and Leon Draw\", ''Sioux City Journal'', Sioux City, Iowa, pg. 2, 30 December 1898</ref><ref>\"Kissed Jimmy Barry\", ''The Pittsburgh Press'', Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, pg. 12, 1 January 1899</ref>  \n\nIn his final bout, he boxed a six-round draw with future Bantamweight champion [[Harry Harris (boxer)|Harry Harris]] on September 1, 1899.   Ringside observers believed that Harris had won, but that the referee called a draw to allow Barry to retire undefeated.  Chicago's ''Inter-Ocean'' wrote that Harris \"clearly outpointed Barry and during the last few rounds forced the fighting after a fashion that should have gained him the decision\".  The ''Chicago Tribune'' wrote that Barry was fortunate to receive a draw as Harris showed considerable skill in avoiding his blows.<ref>\"Barry Draws With Harris\", ''Inter-Ocean'', Chicago, Illinois, pg. 8, 2 September 99</ref><ref>Harris showed skill in avoiding Barry's blows in \"Barry and Harris Draw\", ''The Chicago Tribune'', Chicago, Illinois, pg. 4, 2 September 1899</ref><ref name=IBHOF/>  Through 1901, Barry fought the occasional  exhibition in Chicago, and continued to fight the occasional bout through at least 1910.<ref name=CBZ/>\n\n==Life after boxing==\nAccording to Catholic Church records, Barry married Amanda Martha Claussen in Chicago on November 26, 1902.<ref name=Grave>{{cite web|url=https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/138600742/james-curran-barry|title=James Curran Barry|website=James Curran Barry Grave Record}}</ref> \n\nDuring WWI, in 1917, Barry worked as a boxing instructor at Camp Gordon, northeast of Atlanta, Georgia.  His duties included physical and bayonet training.  WWI army boxing training was led by several exceptional feather and lightweight champions including [[Benny Leonard]], [[Packey McFarland]] and [[Johnny Kilbane]].<ref>Mastro, Frank, \"Barry Knocks Out England's New Champion\", ''Chicago Tribune'', Chicago, Illinois, pg. 27, 9 April 1943</ref>  Unable to continue as an instructor due to physical limitations, he left the Army in October of 1918.<ref>Left Army job in \"Jimmy Barry Forced to Give Up Army Job in ''Star-Gazette'', Elmira, New York, pg. 8, 26 October 1918</ref>\n\nAfter his WWI service, Barry worked in Chicago's Cook County clerk's office for 25 years until he left due to poor health.  He occasionally refereed bouts at local clubs, likely for extra income.  He died in a Chicago Sanitarium on April 5, 1943 after an illness lasting four years, that according to one source may have been tuberculosis.<ref>Possibly tuberculosis in Ward, Charles P., \"A Ward to the Wise\", ''Detroit Free Press'', Detroit, Michigan, pg. 18, 7 April 1943</ref>   After services at Immaculate Conception Church, he was buried in Calvary Cemetery, a Catholic cemetery in the Chicago suburb of Evanston.<ref name=Dies>\"Jimmy Barry, Old Champion, Dies\", ''The Decatur Daily News'', Decatur, Illinois, pg. 10, 5 April 1943</ref><ref>\"Hold Funeral Tomorrow for Jimmy Barry\", ''Chicago Tribune'', Chicago, Illinois, pg. 26, 6 April 1943</ref>\n\nAccording to the [[International Boxing Hall of Fame]], which inducted the diminutive pugilist in the Old Timer category in 2000, Barry was undefeated in 70 professional fights. He won 59 bouts, 39 by knockout, and had nine draws and two no-contests.

In 1991, when [[Taraba State]] was carved out from [[Gongola State]], the geographical entity Gongola State was renamed Adamawa State, with four administrative divisions: Adamawa, [[Michika]], [[Ganye]], [[Mubi]] and Numan.[https://www.familysearch.org/wiki/en/Adamawa_State,_Nigeria_Genealogy] It is the home of the [[American University of Nigeria]] in Yola, [[Federal University of Technology, Yola|Modibbo Adama University of Technology]] Yola, Adamawa State Polytechnic, Yola and Adamawa State college of Nursing and Midwifery. It is one of the thirty-six states that constitute the Federal Republic of Nigeria.\n\nOn May 14, 2013, [[President of Nigeria|President]] [[Goodluck Jonathan]] declared a [[state of emergency]] in Adamawa State, along with neighboring [[Borno State|Borno]] and [[Yobe State]]s, due to [[jihadist]] group [[Boko Haram]]'s [[Boko Haram insurgency|insurgency]].<ref>{{cite news |title=Nigeria declares 'massive' military campaign on borders |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-22544056 |accessdate=June 6, 2013 |publisher=[[BBC News]] |date=May 15, 2013}}</ref>\n\n==Geography==\nAdamawa is one of the largest states of Nigeria and occupies about 36,917 square kilometres. It is bordered by the states of Borno to the northwest, [[Gombe State|Gombe]] to the west and [[Taraba State|Taraba]] to the southwest. Its eastern border forms the national eastern [[Cameroon-Nigeria border|border with]] [[Cameroon]].\n\nTopographically, it is a mountainous land crossed by the large river valleys \u2013 [[Benue River|Benue]], [[Gongola River|Gongola]] and Yedsarem. The valleys of the [[Mount Cameroon]], [[Mandara Mountains]] and [[Adamawa Plateau]] form part of the landscape.\n\n==Economy==\nThe major occupation of the people is [[farming]] as reflected in their two notable vegetational zones, the [[Sudan (region)|Sub-Sudan]] and Northern Guinea Savannah zones. Their cash crops are [[cotton]] and [[Bambara groundnut|groundnuts]] while food crops include [[maize]], [[Yam (vegetable)|yam]], [[cassava]], [[Sorghum bicolor|guinea corn]], [[millet]] and [[rice]].\n\nThe village communities living on the banks of the rivers engage in [[fishing]] while the [[Fula people|Fulanis]] are cattle rearers. The state has a network of roads linking all parts of the country.\n\nThe development of many communities in the state can be traced to the colonial era when the Germans ruled a swath of territory known as the Northern and Southern [[Kamerun]]s from [[Dikwa]] in the North to Victoria ([[Limbe, Cameroon|Limbe]]) on the Atlantic coast in the 19th century. These were, however, handed over as [[United Nations Trust Territories]] to the British at the end of the [[World War I]] with the signing of the [[Treaty of Versailles]]. After a series of referendums, the Northern Kameruns joined Nigeria to form the then Sardauna Province, and the Southern Kameruns formed a Confederation with French speaking Cameroon.\n\n==Religion==\n{{unsourced section|date=April 2020}}\nAdamawa State is home to the [[headquarters]] of two [[Indigenous peoples|indigenous]] churches, the [[Church of the Brethren in Nigeria]] (EYN Church) with its headquarters in Mubi in the northern zone of the state, and the [[Lutheran Church of Christ in Nigeria]] (LCCN Church) with headquarters in Numan in the southern zone of the state. The Church of the Brethren in Nigeria (EYN church) was founded in Garkida Gombi Local Government of the state in March 1923 by American missionaries. The Lutheran Church of Christ in Nigeria (LCCN Church) was founded in Numan by Dutch missionaries in 1913.\n\n==History==\n{{main article|Adamawa Emirate}}\nBefore it became a state in Nigeria, Adamawa was a subordinate kingdom of the [[Sultanate of Sokoto]] which also included much of northern Cameroon. The rulers bear the title of [[emir]] (\"{{lang|fub|lamido}}\" in the local language, [[Fulfulde]]).\n\nThe name \"Adamawa\" came from the founder of the kingdom, [[Modibo Adama]], a regional leader of the [[Fula jihads|Fulani Jihad]] organized by [[Usman dan Fodio]] of Sokoto in 1804.

In 1991, when [[Taraba State]] was carved out from [[Gongola State]], the geographical entity Gongola State was renamed Adamawa State, with four administrative divisions: Adamawa, [[Michika]], [[Ganye]], [[Mubi]] and Numan.[https://www.familysearch.org/wiki/en/Adamawa_State,_Nigeria_Genealogy] It is the home of the [[American University of Nigeria]] in Yola, [[Federal University of Technology, Yola|Modibbo Adama University of Technology]] Yola, Adamawa State Polytechnic, Yola and Adamawa State college of Nursing and Midwifery. It is one of the thirty-six states that constitute the Federal Republic of Nigeria.\n\nOn May 14, 2013, [[President of Nigeria|President]] [[Goodluck Jonathan]] declared a [[state of emergency]] in Adamawa State, along with neighboring [[Borno State|Borno]] and [[Yobe State]]s, due to [[jihadist]] group [[Boko Haram]]'s [[Boko Haram insurgency|insurgency]].<ref>{{cite news |title=Nigeria declares 'massive' military campaign on borders |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-22544056 |accessdate=June 6, 2013 |publisher=[[BBC News]] |date=May 15, 2013}}</ref>\n\n==Geography==\nAdamawa is one of the largest states of Nigeria and occupies about 36,917 square kilometres. It is bordered by the states of Borno to the northwest, [[Gombe State|Gombe]] to the west and [[Taraba State|Taraba]] to the southwest. Its eastern border forms the national eastern [[Cameroon-Nigeria border|border with]] [[Cameroon]].\n\nTopographically, it is a mountainous land crossed by the large river valleys \u2013 [[Benue River|Benue]], [[Gongola River|Gongola]] and Yedsarem. The valleys of the [[Mount Cameroon]], [[Mandara Mountains]] and [[Adamawa Plateau]] form part of the landscape.\n\n==Economy==\nThe major occupation of the people is [[farming]] as reflected in their two notable vegetational zones, the [[Sudan (region)|Sub-Sudan]] and Northern Guinea Savannah zones. Their cash crops are [[cotton]] and [[Bambara groundnut|groundnuts]] while food crops include [[maize]], [[Yam (vegetable)|yam]], [[cassava]], [[Sorghum bicolor|guinea corn]], [[millet]] and [[rice]].\n\nThe village communities living on the banks of the rivers engage in [[fishing]] while the [[Fula people|Fulanis]] are cattle rearers. The state has a network of roads linking all parts of the country.\n\nThe development of many communities in the state can be traced to the colonial era when the Germans ruled a swath of territory known as the Northern and Southern [[Kamerun]]s from [[Dikwa]] in the North to Victoria ([[Limbe, Cameroon|Limbe]]) on the Atlantic coast in the 19th century. These were, however, handed over as [[United Nations Trust Territories]] to the British at the end of the [[World War I]] with the signing of the [[Treaty of Versailles]]. After a series of referendums, the Northern Kameruns joined Nigeria to form the then Sardauna Province, and the Southern Kameruns formed a Confederation with French speaking Cameroon.\n\n==Religion==\n{{unsourced section|date=April 2020}}\nAdamawa State is home to the [[headquarters]] of two [[indigenous]] churches, the [[Church of the Brethren in Nigeria]] (EYN Church) with its headquarters in Mubi in the northern zone of the state, and the [[Lutheran Church of Christ in Nigeria]] (LCCN Church) with headquarters in Numan in the southern zone of the state. The Church of the Brethren in Nigeria (EYN church) was founded in Garkida Gombi Local Government of the state in March 1923 by American missionaries. The Lutheran Church of Christ in Nigeria (LCCN Church) was founded in Numan by Dutch missionaries in 1913.\n\n==History==\n{{main article|Adamawa Emirate}}\nBefore it became a state in Nigeria, Adamawa was a subordinate kingdom of the [[Sultanate of Sokoto]] which also included much of northern Cameroon. The rulers bear the title of [[emir]] (\"{{lang|fub|lamido}}\" in the local language, [[Fulfulde]]).\n\nThe name \"Adamawa\" came from the founder of the kingdom, [[Modibo Adama]], a regional leader of the [[Fula jihads|Fulani Jihad]] organized by [[Usman dan Fodio]] of Sokoto in 1804. Modibo Adama came from the region of Gurin (now just a small village) and in 1806, received a green flag for leading the jihad in his native country. In the following years, Adama conquered many lands and tribes. In 1838, he moved his capital to Ribadu, and in 1839, to Joboliwo. In 1841, he founded [[Yola, Nigeria|Yola]], where he died in 1848. After the [[History of colonialism|European colonization]] (first by Germany and then by Britain), the rulers remained as emirs and the line of succession has continued to the present day.\n[[File:Adamawa state contingent 1.jpg |thumb|Dancers of Adamawa state in their cultural adornment]]\n\nA [[measles]] outbreak was reported in an [[internally displaced person]]s camp in January 2015.<ref>{{cite news |author=Mohammed Ismail |url=http://allafrica.com/stories/201501160208.html |title=Nigeria: Adamawa IDPs' Camps Record Outbreak of Measles |publisher=AllAfrica |date=January 16, 2015}}</ref>\n\n=== Emirs of Adamawa ===\nEmirs of Adamawa have included:\n\n* [[Modibbo Adama|Modibbo Adama ben Hassan]], 1809\u20131848\n* Lawalu ben Adama, 1848\u20131872 (son of the previous) \n* Sanda ben Adama, 1872\u20131890 (brother of the previous)\n* [[Zubayru ben Adama]], 1890\u20131901 (brother of the previous)\n* Bobbo Ahmadu ben Adama, 1901\u20131909 (brother of the previous)\n* Iya ben Sanda, 1909\u20131910 (son of Sanda ben Adama)\n* Muhammadu Abba, 1910\u20131924 (son of Bobbo Ahmadu ben Adama)\n* Muhammadu Bello ben Ahmadu ben Hamidu ben Adamu, 1924\u20131928\n* Mustafa ben Muhammadu Abba, 1928\u20131946 (son of Muhammadu Abba)\n* Ahmadu ben Muhammadu Bello, 1946\u20131953\n* Aliyu Mustafa, 1953\u20132010\n* [[Muhammadu Barkindo Aliyu Musdafa]], 2011\u2013present\n\n=== Boko Haram insurgency ===\nAdamawa State has been badly impacted by the Boko Haram insurgency.

Juan Carlos died two years before his own father, [[Juan Alfonso P\u00e9rez de Guzm\u00e1n, 6th Duke of Medina Sidonia]], thus he did not inherit the ducal title and died as the 9th [[Count of Niebla]] only.\n\nHis paternal grandmother was [[Ana de Arag\u00f3n y de Gurrea]], died 1528, one of the daughters, \"born out of sin\", of [[Alonso de Arag\u00f3n y Ruiz de Iborra, Archbishop of Zaragoza]], himself an illegitimate son of king [[Ferdinand II of Arag\u00f3n]]. In 1518 she had married two Dukes of Medina Sidonia: firstly with [[Alfonso P\u00e9rez de Guzm\u00e1n, 5th Duke of Medina Sidonia]], died childless, 1548, formally declared \"mentecato\", (out of his mind, unfit to reason properly), and then again, in the same year with the 5th Duke's brother, [[Juan Alfonso P\u00e9rez de Guzm\u00e1n, 6th Duke of Medina Sidonia]], (24 March 1502, died [[Sanl\u00facar de Barrameda]], [[province of C\u00e1diz]], [[Spain]], 26 November 1558).\n\nHis mother was a most powerful and wealthy lady, Leonor de Z\u00fa\u00f1iga y Sotomayor, herself daughter of a powerful duchess, Teresa de Z\u00fa\u00f1iga, 2nd marchioness of Ayamonte, 3rd duchess of B\u00e9jar, 4th countess of Ba\u00f1ares, 2nd marchioness of Gibrale\u00f3n, so it was her name Z\u00fa\u00f1iga, the one to be passed to the family, as she was married to a \"Sotomayor\" of a family less endowed with nobility titles, county of [[Belalc\u00e1zar, Spain|Belalc\u00e1zar]], something by no means unique in the High Spanish Nobility of the time.\n\nAs his father, Juan Carlos, had already died in 1556, Don Alonso became Duke, and master of one of the greatest fortunes in [[Europe]], on the death of his grandfather in 1559, aged only around 9.<ref name=\"EB1911\">{{EB1911|inline=1 |wstitle=Medina Sidonia, Don Alonso Perez de Guzman el Bueno  |volume=18 |pages=66-67}} This cites Ces\u00e1rio Duro, ''La Armada invincible'' (Madrid, 1884), which gives numerous references to authorities.</ref>\n\n==Betrothal and marriage==\nThe 7th duke was betrothed in 1565 to [[Ana de Silva y Mendoza]], who was then four years of age, the daughter of the [[Rui Gomes da Silva, 1st Prince of \u00c9boli|Prince and the]] [[Ana de Mendoza, Princess of \u00c9boli|Princess of \u00c9boli]]. In 1572 when the duchess was little more than ten years of age, the [[pope]] granted a [[Dispensation (Catholic Church)|dispensation]] for the [[consummate|consummation]] of the marriage.<ref name=\"EB1911\"/> The Duke of Medina Sidonia had a son, [[Juan Manuel P\u00e9rez de Guzm\u00e1n, 8th Duke of Medina Sidonia|Juan Manuel]], who succeeded his father.\n\nThe scandal of the time, for which there appears to be no foundation, accused [[Philip II of Spain|Philip II]] of a love intrigue with the mother of the young girl, [[Ana de Mendoza e de la Cerda|princess of Eboli]]. The unvarying and unmerited favor he showed the duke has been accounted for on the ground that he took a paternal interest in the duchess, Ana de Mendoza daughter.<ref name=\"EB1911\"/>\n\n[[Don (honorific)|Don]] Alonso made no serious effort to save his [[mother-in-law]] [[Ana de Mendoza, Princess of \u00c9boli]] from the later persecution she suffered at the hands of Philip II. His correspondence is full of whining complaints of poverty, and appeals to the king for pecuniary favors. In 1581 he was created a [[knight of the Golden Fleece]], and was named [[Captain General]] of [[Lombardy]]. By pressing supplications to the king he got himself exempted on the ground of poverty and poor health.<ref name=\"EB1911\"/>\n\nDon Alonso was also the patron of don [[Jer\u00f3nimo S\u00e1nchez de Carranza]] who wrote the premier text on the Spanish system of swordplay which was called the 'True Art' or the ''[[Verdadera Destreza]]''. He was asked by King Philip II of Spain to lead the Spanish Armada.\n\n==Spanish Armada==\n\n===Preparations===\nWhen the [[\u00c1lvaro de Baz\u00e1n|Marquis of Santa Cruz]] died, on 9 February 1588, Philip insisted on appointing the 7th Duke to the command of the Armada.<ref name=\"EB1911\"/> He had prepared his orders to the Duke of Medina Sidonia already three days before the death of Santa Cruz. The motivation of Philip's decision is unknown, but it may have been grounded in his consideration of the duke's very high social rank, administrative competence, modesty and tactfulness, and last but not least his reputation as a good [[Roman Catholic]] Christian. The micro-managing king probably wanted a commander who would obey his instructions to the letter, which was less likely to happen if Santa Cruz was in command, or either of the most experienced officers in the Armada, [[Juan Martinez de Recalde]] and [[Miguel de Oquendo]].He also had massive tits.\n\nThe disadvantages of this choice were highlighted by himself in his own letter to the king, in which he stressed his lack of military experience on land and at sea, his lack of information about either the English enemy or the Spanish war plans, his poor health and tendency to [[sea-sickness]], and his inability to contribute financially to the expedition. Philip II may never have seen this letter, for his secretaries Don [[Juan de Idiaquez]] and Don [[Cristobal de Moura]] replied to the duke that they dared not show it to the king.\n\nHistorians have speculated that Medina Sidonia himself did not believe in the success of the Armada, and that this motivated his attempt to reject the command or his later letter to the king in which he advised to seek peace or at least postpone the operation. The opinion of the duke is unrecorded, but skepticism about the fate of the Armada is known to have existed among senior Spanish officers and informed foreign commentators.\n\nThe opinion of modern historians on Medina Sidonia's efforts to prepare the Armada is generally favorable. He reorganized the fleet, rationalized the chaotic distribution of loads and guns, and increased the ammunition supplies from 30 to 50 rounds per gun. The permission of the king to add the Castilian galleons of the \"Indian Guard\" to the Armada nearly doubled its first-line fighting strength. Under the duke's command the material and personnel state of the Armada was much improved. The distribution of cannons and ammunition was rationalized, and he got permission from Philip to lodge some of his men ashore; prior to that, the king had insisted that the sailors be kept aboard their ships at all times, which had a disastrous effect on the health and morale of the fleet. He managed to establish good relationships with his subordinate commanders, and gathered additional supplies right up to the point of sailing.\n\n===Fleet command===\nMedina Sidonia's behavior as a fleet commander in the ensuing series of fights with the English has come under more criticism. Lacking military experience, he showed little initiative or self-confidence, instead cautiously obeying the instructions of the king, and relying on the opinion of his advisers and subordinate commanders. This tendency was reinforced by the senior adviser appointed to him by the king, [[Diego Flores de Valdes]], an experienced sea officer but also a man renowned for his caution. Medina Sidonia also seriously underestimated the difficulty of coordinating his actions with the commander of the Spanish forces in the Netherlands, [[Alexander Farnese, Duke of Parma]], who was supposed to launch his invasion fleet to meet the Armada at sea. However, this problem was fundamental to the operational plan imposed on the two commanders by Philip II.\n\nAllowing for the limitations inherent in a total lack of command experience, Medina Sidonia fought the battle courageously and intelligently. His health suffered badly as a result of the campaign, and after his return to Spain the king finally relieved him of his command and granted him permission to return home to convalesce. Later, he served the Spanish crown for another two decades in various functions. The duke's reputation suffered, because several popular accounts, notably the one written by the monk [[Juan de Victoria]], placed all blame for the defeat on him.\n\nInformed commentators and modern historians have put most of the blame on Philip II himself for imposing an impractical plan on his commanders, and on Diego Flores de Valdes for badly advising the duke. Philip II himself did not single out his chosen commander to bear the responsibility for the defeat. He stated \"Action without cause is illegitimate of reason\" in response to public outcry on re-sending a fleet to Britain. The duke retained his posts of [[admiral of the ocean]] and captain-general of [[Andalusia]], and continued to serve Philip II and later [[Philip II of Spain|Philip III]].\n\nThe popular image {{where?|date=September 2013}} of the duke in later years was strongly influenced by propaganda surrounding the Armada, including an English account which claimed that the Duke of Medina Sidonia was a fool and a coward who hid below decks in a specially reinforced room. This story became a lasting part of popular descriptions of the battle, in which the Duke of Medinia Sidonia was frequently portrayed as an incompetent buffoon.\n\n==Later years==\nWhen an English fleet [[Capture of C\u00e1diz|attacked]] [[C\u00e1diz]] in 1596, his allegedly slow response was blamed for giving the English enough time to sack the city.\n\nIn 1606 the obstinacy and folly of the duke caused the loss of a squadron which was destroyed near [[Gibraltar]] by the Dutch.<ref name=\"EB1911\"/> This event made the duke a satirical target of [[Miguel de Cervantes]].\n\n==In popular culture==\n* In the [[Suske en Wiske]] comic book story \"De Stierentemmer\" (\"The Bull Tamer\") (1952) the character [[Tante Sidonia]] learns that she is related to the 16th century duke of Medina Sidonia, Alonso P\u00e9rez de Guzm\u00e1n.<ref>Vandersteen, Willy, \"De Stierentemmer\", Standaard Uitgeverij, 1952.</ref> In the Dutch educational comic strip series ''[[Van Nul tot Nu]]'' (1982), which tells the history of the [[Netherlands]] in comic book form, Alonso P\u00e9rez de Guzm\u00e1n is caricatured as Tante Sidonia as a nod to ''Suske en Wiske''.<ref>Co Van Loerakker, Thom van Roep, \"Van Nul tot Nu: Part I\", 1982, Oberon/Big Balloon, page 51.</ref>\n* The children's fantasy novel ''[[The House with a Clock in Its Walls]]'' features an appearance by the Duke of Medina Sidonia, in command of the Armada, as a type of magical hologram. This element was not included in the [[The House with a Clock in Its Walls (film)|2018 film adaptation]].\n* The [[alternate history]] novel ''[[Ruled Britannia]]'' is set in a world where the Duke's Armada defeated the English.

The duke's reputation suffered, because several popular accounts, notably the one written by the monk [[Juan de Victoria]], placed all blame for the defeat on him.\n\nInformed commentators and modern historians have put most of the blame on Philip II himself for imposing an impractical plan on his commanders, and on Diego Flores de Valdes for badly advising the duke. Philip II himself did not single out his chosen commander to bear the responsibility for the defeat. He stated \"Action without cause is illegitimate of reason\" in response to public outcry on re-sending a fleet to Britain. The duke retained his posts of [[admiral of the ocean]] and captain-general of [[Andalusia]], and continued to serve Philip II and later [[Philip II of Spain|Philip III]].\n\nThe popular image {{where?|date=September 2013}} of the duke in later years was strongly influenced by propaganda surrounding the Armada, including an English account which claimed that the Duke of Medina Sidonia was a fool and a coward who hid below decks in a specially reinforced room. This story became a lasting part of popular descriptions of the battle, in which the Duke of Medinia Sidonia was frequently portrayed as an incompetent buffoon.\n\n==Later years==\nWhen an English fleet [[Capture of C\u00e1diz|attacked]] [[C\u00e1diz]] in 1596, his allegedly slow response was blamed for giving the English enough time to sack the city.\n\nIn 1606 the obstinacy and folly of the duke caused the loss of a squadron which was destroyed near [[Gibraltar]] by the Dutch.<ref name=\"EB1911\"/> This event made the duke a satirical target of [[Miguel de Cervantes]].\n\n==In popular culture==\n* In the [[Suske en Wiske]] comic book story \"De Stierentemmer\" (\"The Bull Tamer\") (1952) the character [[Tante Sidonia]] learns that she is related to the 16th century duke of Medina Sidonia, Alonso P\u00e9rez de Guzm\u00e1n.<ref>Vandersteen, Willy, \"De Stierentemmer\", Standaard Uitgeverij, 1952.</ref> In the Dutch educational comic strip series ''[[Van Nul tot Nu]]'' (1982), which tells the history of the [[Netherlands]] in comic book form, Alonso P\u00e9rez de Guzm\u00e1n is caricatured as Tante Sidonia as a nod to ''Suske en Wiske''.<ref>Co Van Loerakker, Thom van Roep, \"Van Nul tot Nu: Part I\", 1982, Oberon/Big Balloon, page 51.</ref>\n* The children's fantasy novel ''[[The House with a Clock in Its Walls]]'' features an appearance by the Duke of Medina Sidonia, in command of the Armada, as a type of magical hologram. This element was not included in the [[The House with a Clock in Its Walls (film)|2018 film adaptation]].\n* The [[alternate history]] novel ''[[Ruled Britannia]]'' is set in a world where the Duke's Armada defeated the English. While the Duke does not appear, his fictitious nephew Baltasar Guzm\u00e1n, an army officer, is a prominent character.\n\n==Ancestry==\n{{ahnentafel\n|collapsed=yes|align=center\n|boxstyle_1=background-color: #fcc;\n|boxstyle_2=background-color: #fb9;\n|boxstyle_3=background-color: #ffc;\n|boxstyle_4=background-color: #bfc;\n|boxstyle_5=background-color: #9fe;\n|1= 1.
