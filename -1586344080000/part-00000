Tuck began training in [[Brazilian jiu-jitsu]] and MMA with his cousin, about six years before coming to the UFC.

Three regions of Latvia meet in the vicinity of Tukums \u2013 [[Vidzeme]], [[Zemgale]] and [[Courland]].\n\n== History ==\n\nThe historical center of Tukums developed between trade routes leading from the mouth of the [[Daugava River]] to [[Prussia]]. The oldest part is today's Talsi Street that originated at the river named Zvirgzdupite where there used to be a castle mound with a wooden castle. Since 1253 Tukums was ruled by the [[Livonian Order]]. A masonry castle was built on the bank of the [[Slocene]] river in the end of the 13th century. The castle was surrounded by settlements of [[Germans|German]] tradesmen and craftsmen. A marketplace was formed in front of the castle and some new streets appeared later running in various directions from the market place.\n\nWith the development of trade in the 16th century a new straighter trade route to Prussia was built along a new street that is called Liela (large) Street today. This street had an important role in the life of the settlement. Public buildings, major business, workshops and shops were concentrated in it.\n\nAfter the disintegration of the Livonian Order a new state, the [[Duchy of Courland and Semigallia]] was established. Like many other settlements Tukums had suffered greatly the numerous feudal wars. Under the rule of [[Jacob Kettler|Duke Jacob]] (1642\u20131682) Tukums experienced a rapid economic boom. At the time a new trade route from Tukums to [[Jelgava]], the capital of Duchy of Courland and Semigallia, was opened along today's Jelgavas Street, and another route was made along today's Raudas Street towards it. A dam was built and a lake made near the road to Jelgava. A flour mill and a cooper furnace started functioning there, and cooper was exported to foreign countries. The town, inhabited by only 800 people was quite small. The new adornment of Tukums was the lake. The church spire was another landmark added to the skyline in 1687.\n\nAfter 1795 Courland was incorporated into the  [[Russian Empire]]. In November of the same year the [[Catherine II of Russia|Russian Tsaritsa Katherine]] signed a document to divide Courland into regions and to grant regional center rights to several urban settlements, Tukums being one of them.\n\nThe town borders were marked in 1800 and the first urban map was made only two years later. The town continued growing. It included 131 private houses, mostly wooden, and 6 pubs. There were 690 male and 832 female inhabitants. The first school was opened in 1806. Street pavement was introduced in 1860 and street lighting started in 1875. A more rapid development of the town was observed after the opening of the Riga-Tukums railway line in 1877 and of another line connecting Tukums with [[Ventspils]] a little later. 24 enterprises were functioning in Tukums in 1897: tanneries, wood carding-mills, a glue plant and also pottery and food production facilities. The two windmills brought out the uniqueness of the townscape.\n\nThe town grew with the development of industry. Two new districts appeared. The rich built their houses in the eastern part around Elizabetes, Pils and Baznicas Streets, but the workers settled more to the west, forming an area of small houses surrounded by gardens. This part of Tukums was further developed during the year in 1935. In the beginning of the 1930s there were 8000 inhabitants and 73 functioning industrial enterprises in Tukums.\n\n== Places near Tukums ==\n\nThe [[Engure parish]] by the city was host to the [[Soviet Navy]] [[Tukums air base]]. It was converted into a civilian airport.\n\n[[Jaunpils Castle]] is the only fortified castle of the [[Order of Livonia]] that remains in Latvia. It was built in 1301. An exhibition hall and museum are located there on the history of the district. Jaunpils Lutheran Church which was built in 1592 is located near the castle.\n\n[[Jaunmoka Castle|Jaunmoku Palace]] (1901), {{convert|5|km|0|abbr=on}} from Tukums, surrounded by the Courlands hills, hosts an exhibition on forestry. Jaunmoku Palace is a combination of [[Art Nouveau]] elements and [[Neo-Gothic]] forms and was built as the country residence of [[George Armitstead, 1st Baron Armitstead|George Armitstead]], mayor of Riga (1901\u201312).\n\n[[Durbe Manor|Durbe manor house]], ({{lang-lv|Durbes pils}}) rebuilt in 1820, is a classical style palace, surrounded by a landscaped park. A stone bridge across the ravine and a [[Rotunda (architecture)|rotunda]] are located near the manor house.\n\nThe Schlokenbeck estate ensemble in Milzkalne, dating from the 15th century, is the only fortified [[manor house]] in Latvia. A museum on the history of broad building techniques and an exposition of horse gear is set up there.\n\nIn Zante region there is the highest peak of Tukums district \u2013 Smiltinkalns (153m), in the center of Zante there is a Red Army tank, evidence of the battles in \"[[Courland Pocket]]\" in 1944\u20131945.\n\nThe country of Zentene and Seme has the northern landscape of Courland \u2013 hills, curved roads, objects of nature and places of culture history.\n\nThe seashore of Tukums district has a length of {{convert|50|km|0|abbr=on}}, where old fishermen's huts alternate with modern villas, and sandy beaches interchange with rocky shores and meadows.\n\n[[Kandava]] was the capital of the ancient Couronian state of Vanema. In the beginning of the 13th century, German knights built their castle there, though not much has been preserved from that time. In the Middle Ages, Kandava underwent numerous wars, fires and plague epidemics. The Kandava hills are covered with dense forests and the [[Abava Rapids]] of the [[Abava River]].

{{lang-de|Tuckum}}; {{lang-liv|Tuk\u0101m\u014d}}) is a [[town]] in [[Latvia]]. Three regions of Latvia meet in the vicinity of Tukums \u2013 [[Vidzeme]], [[Zemgale]] and [[Courland]].\n\n== History ==\n\nThe historical center of Tukums developed between trade routes leading from the mouth of the [[Daugava River]] to [[Prussia]]. The oldest part is today's Talsi Street that originated at the river named Zvirgzdupite where there used to be a castle mound with a wooden castle. Since 1253 Tukums was ruled by the [[Livonian Order]]. A masonry castle was built on the bank of the [[Slocene]] river in the end of the 13th century. The castle was surrounded by settlements of [[Germans|German]] tradesmen and craftsmen. A marketplace was formed in front of the castle and some new streets appeared later running in various directions from the market place.\n\nWith the development of trade in the 16th century a new straighter trade route to Prussia was built along a new street that is called Liela (large) Street today. This street had an important role in the life of the settlement. Public buildings, major business, workshops and shops were concentrated in it.\n\nAfter the disintegration of the Livonian Order a new state, the [[Duchy of Courland and Semigallia]] was established. Like many other settlements Tukums had suffered greatly the numerous feudal wars. Under the rule of [[Jacob Kettler|Duke Jacob]] (1642\u20131682) Tukums experienced a rapid economic boom. At the time a new trade route from Tukums to [[Jelgava]], the capital of Duchy of Courland and Semigallia, was opened along today's Jelgavas Street, and another route was made along today's Raudas Street towards it. A dam was built and a lake made near the road to Jelgava. A flour mill and a cooper furnace started functioning there, and cooper was exported to foreign countries. The town, inhabited by only 800 people was quite small. The new adornment of Tukums was the lake. The church spire was another landmark added to the skyline in 1687.\n\nAfter 1795 Courland was incorporated into the  [[Russian Empire]]. In November of the same year the [[Catherine II of Russia|Russian Tsaritsa Katherine]] signed a document to divide Courland into regions and to grant regional center rights to several urban settlements, Tukums being one of them.\n\nThe town borders were marked in 1800 and the first urban map was made only two years later. The town continued growing. It included 131 private houses, mostly wooden, and 6 pubs. There were 690 male and 832 female inhabitants. The first school was opened in 1806. Street pavement was introduced in 1860 and street lighting started in 1875. A more rapid development of the town was observed after the opening of the Riga-Tukums railway line in 1877 and of another line connecting Tukums with [[Ventspils]] a little later. 24 enterprises were functioning in Tukums in 1897: tanneries, wood carding-mills, a glue plant and also pottery and food production facilities. The two windmills brought out the uniqueness of the townscape.\n\nThe town grew with the development of industry. Two new districts appeared. The rich built their houses in the eastern part around Elizabetes, Pils and Baznicas Streets, but the workers settled more to the west, forming an area of small houses surrounded by gardens. This part of Tukums was further developed during the year in 1935. In the beginning of the 1930s there were 8000 inhabitants and 73 functioning industrial enterprises in Tukums.\n\n== Places near Tukums ==\n\nThe [[Engure parish]] by the city was host to the [[Soviet Navy]] [[Tukums air base]]. It was converted into a civilian airport.\n\n[[Jaunpils Castle]] is the only fortified castle of the [[Order of Livonia]] that remains in Latvia. It was built in 1301. An exhibition hall and museum are located there on the history of the district. Jaunpils Lutheran Church which was built in 1592 is located near the castle.\n\n[[Jaunmoka Castle|Jaunmoku Palace]] (1901), {{convert|5|km|0|abbr=on}} from Tukums, surrounded by the Courlands hills, hosts an exhibition on forestry. Jaunmoku Palace is a combination of [[Art Nouveau]] elements and [[Neo-Gothic]] forms and was built as the country residence of [[George Armitstead, 1st Baron Armitstead|George Armitstead]], mayor of Riga (1901\u201312).\n\n[[Durbe Manor|Durbe manor house]], ({{lang-lv|Durbes pils}}) rebuilt in 1820, is a classical style palace, surrounded by a landscaped park. A stone bridge across the ravine and a [[Rotunda (architecture)|rotunda]] are located near the manor house.\n\nThe Schlokenbeck estate ensemble in Milzkalne, dating from the 15th century, is the only fortified [[manor house]] in Latvia. A museum on the history of broad building techniques and an exposition of horse gear is set up there.\n\nIn Zante region there is the highest peak of Tukums district \u2013 Smiltinkalns (153m), in the center of Zante there is a Red Army tank, evidence of the battles in \"[[Courland Pocket]]\" in 1944\u20131945.\n\nThe country of Zentene and Seme has the northern landscape of Courland \u2013 hills, curved roads, objects of nature and places of culture history.\n\nThe seashore of Tukums district has a length of {{convert|50|km|0|abbr=on}}, where old fishermen's huts alternate with modern villas, and sandy beaches interchange with rocky shores and meadows.\n\n[[Kandava]] was the capital of the ancient Couronian state of Vanema. In the beginning of the 13th century, German knights built their castle there, though not much has been preserved from that time. In the Middle Ages, Kandava underwent numerous wars, fires and plague epidemics. The Kandava hills are covered with dense forests and the [[Abava Rapids]] of the [[Abava River]]. Kandava marks the beginning of the run of the [[Abava Valley]], which was named the \"Switzerland of Courland\" as early as the 19th century{{by whom|date=October 2014}}.\n\n== Places in Tukums ==\n\n=== Museums ===\n[[File:Durbes pils 19.gs.jpg|thumb|Durbe manor house in the 19th century.]]\n* Castle Tower of Tukums \u2013 Brivibas square 19a\n* Durbe Manor house \u2013 M.Parka street 7\n* Jaunmokas Palace Museum \u2013 Jaunmokas\n* Jaunpils Museum \u2013 Jaunpils\n* Pastari\u0146\u0161 Museum \u2013 Bisnieki, Zentene\n* [[\u0160lokenbeka Castle|\u0160lokenbeka Manor]] \u2013 Milzkalne\n* Tukums Museum \u2013 Harmonijas street 7\n\n==Notable people==\n[[File:Joe Magidsohn.jpg|thumb|right|170px|[[Joe Magidsohn]]]]\n*[[Ronalds Ar\u0101js]], Latvian athlete\n*[[Kristaps Blanks]], [[football (soccer)|football]] [[Striker (association football)|striker]], [[Skonto FC]] and Latvian national football team player\n*[[\u0100dolfs B\u013codnieks]], [[Prime Minister of Latvia]]\n*[[L\u012bga K\u013cavi\u0146a]], Latvian heptathlete\n*[[Dainis K\u016bla]], [[javelin throw]]er and [[1980 Summer Olympics|1980 Olympic]] champion\n*[[Jevg\u0113\u0146ijs Kosma\u010dovs]], [[FK Ventspils]] and Latvian national football team midfielder\n*[[Joe Magidsohn]], Football All-American\n*[[Janis Roze]], Latvian Biologist, philosopher\n*[[Samanta T\u012bna]], singer\n*[[Viktor Tsoi]], [[Soviet Rock]] band [[Kino (band)|Kino]] leader died near Tukums.\n*[[Bertram Zarins]], prominent orthopedic surgeon at [[Massachusetts General Hospital]] and [[Harvard University]], born in Tukums\n\n==Twin towns \u2014 sister cities==\n{{See also|List of twin towns and sister cities in Latvia}}\n\nTukums is [[Twin towns and sister cities|twinned]] with:<ref>{{cite web |title=Starptautisk\u0101 sadarb\u012bba|url=https://www.tukums.lv/lv/tukuma-novada-pasvaldiba-1/starptautiska-sadarbiba|website=tukums.lv|publisher=Tukums|language=lv|accessdate=2019-08-31}}</ref>\n{{div col|colwidth=20em}}\n*{{flagicon|POL}} [[Andrych\u00f3w]], Poland\n*{{flagicon|ISR}} [[Bnei Ayish]], Israel\n*{{flagicon|FRA}} [[Chennevi\u00e8res-sur-Marne]], France\n*{{flagicon|UKR}} [[Izium]], Ukraine\n*{{flagicon|BLR}} [[Karelichy]], Belarus\n*{{flagicon|RUS}} [[Krasnogorsk, Moscow Oblast|Krasnogorsk]], Russia\n*{{flagicon|LTU}} [[Plung\u0117]], Lithuania\n*{{flagicon|GER}} [[Schee\u00dfel]], Germany\n*{{flagicon|SWE}} [[Tidaholm]], Sweden\n{{div col end}}\n\n== Newspapers ==\n* ''[[Neatkar\u012bg\u0101s Tukuma Zi\u0146as]]''\n* ''[[Tukuma Zi\u0146ot\u0101js]]''\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Commons category|Tukums}}\n{{wikivoyage|Tukums}}\n*[https://www.tukums.lv/lv/tukuma-novads/par-novadu Site of Tukums city]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20090729084138/http://www.turisms.tukums.lv/index/vietas?lang=3 Tukums Tourist Information Center]\n\n{{Cities and parishes of Tukums District}}\n{{Latvian regional cities}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Tukums|*]]\n[[Category:Towns in Latvia]]\n[[Category:1795 establishments in Europe]]\n[[Category:Castles of the Teutonic Knights]]\n[[Category:Tuckum County]]\n[[Category:18th-century establishments in Latvia]]\n[[Category:Tukums Municipality]]\n", "name_user": "Infogapp1", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200ePlaces near Tukums:Added more description for Abava Valley and external references", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tukums"}

Its territory is crossed by the [[Alps]] and the [[Apennine Mountains|Apennines]] [[Mountain chain|mountains chains]]. Liguria is bordered by [[France]] ([[Provence-Alpes-C\u00f4te d'Azur]]) to the west, [[Piedmont]] to the north, and [[Emilia-Romagna]] and [[Tuscany]] to the east. It lies on the [[Ligurian Sea]], and has a population of 1,557,533. The region is part of the [[Alps\u2013Mediterranean Euroregion|Alps-Mediterranean Euroregion]].\n\n==Etymology==\nThe name ''Liguria'' predates [[Latin]] and is of obscure origin. The Latin [[adjectives]] {{lang|la|Ligusticum}} (as in {{lang|la|Mare Ligusticum}}) and ''Liguscus''<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.dicolatin.com/|title=DicoLatin|website=DicoLatin}}</ref> reveal the original root of the name, ''ligusc-'': in the Latin name -sc- was shortened to -s-, and later turned into the -r- of {{lang|la|Liguria}}, according to [[rhotacism (sound change)|rhotacism]]. Compare {{lang-grc|\u03bb\u03af\u03b3\u03c5\u03c2|translit=L\u00edgus|translation=a Ligurian, a person from Liguria}} whence {{lang|grc-Latn|Ligustik\u1e17}} {{lang|grc|\u03bb\u03b9\u03b3\u03c5\u03c3\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03ae}} {{translation|the name of the place Liguria}}.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/morph?l=ligus&la=greek#lexicon|title=Greek Word Study Tool|website=www.perseus.tufts.edu}}</ref> The name derives from the ancient [[Ligures]] people, although in reality the territory of this people were much larger than those of the current region and included all the North-west Italy south to [[Po (river)|Po river]], and south-eastern [[France]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2019}}\n\nSome scholars see a possible connection with [[Old European languages]], as the formant -sc- (-sk-) is also present in names like [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscan]], [[Euskadi]] (the [[endonym]] of the Basques), and [[Gascony|Gascon]]. Since these are all coastal regions, the shared formant may relate to a shared descent from pre-Indo-European, maritime peoples, <ref>Room, \"Placenames of the World,\" 2006</ref><ref>Marie Henri d'Arbois de Jubainville, Premiers Habitants de l'Europe (2nd edition 1889-1894)</ref> and/or the hypothetical [[Tyrsenian languages|Tyrsenian]] and [[Vasconic]] language families resectively. This argument is weakened, however, by the fact that the name Etruscan is a relatively late [[exonym]] and the relevant endonym, used\nof the Etruscans themselves, was ''Rasenna'' or ''Ra\u015bna''. (In Greek this mutated into  ''Turs\u0113noi''  and ''Tyrr\u0113noi''; in Latin it became ''Etruria'' and ''Toscana''.)\n\n==Geography==\n[[File:Spezia monterosso.jpg|thumb|left|150px|A view of [[Cinque Terre]].]]\nLiguria is bordered by [[France]] ([[Provence-Alpes-C\u00f4te d'Azur]]) to the west, [[Piedmont]] to the north, and [[Emilia-Romagna]] and [[Tuscany]] to the east. It lies on the [[Ligurian Sea]]. The narrow strip of land is bordered by the [[Ligurian Sea|sea]], the [[Alps]] and the [[Appenine|Apennines]] mountains. Some mountains rise above {{convert|2000|m|abbr=on}}; the [[Drainage divide|watershed]] line runs at an average altitude of about {{convert|1000|m|abbr=on}}. The highest point of the region is the summit of [[Monte Saccarello]] ({{convert|2201|m|abbr=on|disp=comma}}).\n\nThe winding arched extension goes from [[Ventimiglia, Italy|Ventimiglia]] to [[La Spezia]]. Of this, {{convert|3524.08|km2|2|abbr=on}} are mountainous (65% of the total) and {{convert|891.95|km2|2|abbr=on}} are hills (35% of the total). Liguria's natural reserva'iu(iygbzo(\u00e8!gyb\n\n\nes cover 12% of the entire region, or {{convert|600|km2|abbr=on}} of land. They are made up of one national reserve, six large parks, two smaller parks and three nature reserves.\n\nThe continental shelf is very narrow, and so steep it descends almost immediately to considerable depths along its {{convert|350|km|adj=on}} coastline. Except for the [[Portovenere]] and [[Portofino]] promontories, the coast is generally not very jagged, and is often high. At the mouths of the biggest watercourses are small beaches, but there are no deep bays and natural harbours except at [[Genoa]] and [[La Spezia]].\n\nThe hills lying immediately beyond the coast together with the sea account for a mild climate year-round. Average winter temperatures are {{convert|7|to|10|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|abbr=on}} and summer temperatures are {{convert|23|to|24|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|abbr=on}}, which make for a pleasant stay even in the dead of winter. Rainfall can be abundant at times, as mountains very close to the coast create an [[orographic]] effect. Genoa and [[La Spezia]] can see up to {{convert|2000|mm|-1|abbr=on}} of rain in a year; other areas instead show the normal Mediterranean rainfall of {{convert|500|to|800|mm|-1|abbr=on}} annually.\n\n==History==\n{{see also|List of museums in Liguria}}\n\n===Prehistory and Roman times===\n\n[[File:Regio IX Liguria.jpg|250px|thumbnail|Map of Roman Liguria, between the River [[Var (river)|Var]] and [[Magra]].]]\n[[File:La Ligurie de Mercator 1576.jpg|250px|thumbnail|Map of ancient Liguria, between the river [[Var (river)|Var]] and [[Magra]]. [[Cannes]] is annexed by France in [[Middle Ages]].]]\n[[File:County of nice.svg|250px|thumb|[[County of Nice]] western part of Liguria annexed by France in 1860.]]\n\nAccording to classical sources, the Ligurians ([[Ligures]]) once lived in a far broader territory than present-day Liguria. For example, the Greek colony of [[Marseille|Massalia]], modern [[Marseille]]{{Citation needed|reason=no source mentions this|date=March 2020}}, was recorded to lie in Ligurian territory.\n\n[[File:Luna Amphitheater1.jpg|thumb|250px|The Roman amphitheatre of [[Luni, Italy|Luni]] (1st century AD).]]\n\nDuring the first [[Punic War]], the ancient Ligurians were divided, some of them siding with [[Carthage]] and a minority with Rome, whose allies included the future [[Republic of Genoa|Genoese]]. Under [[Augustus]], Liguria was designated a [[Augustan regions of Italy|region of Italy]] (''Regio IX Liguria'') stretching from the coast to the banks of the [[Po River]]. The great Roman roads (Aurelia and Julia Augusta on the coast, Postumia and Aemilia Scauri towards the inland) helped strengthen territorial unity and increase communication and trade. Important towns developed on the coast, of which evidence is left in the ruins of [[Albenga]], Ventimiglia and [[Luni, Italy|Luni]].\n\n===Middle Ages===\n\n[[File:Strabismo di Venere - Botticelli.jpg|thumb|left|150px|[[Simonetta Vespucci]], a native Ligurian who was a famous beauty during the Renaissance, may have been the model for [[Sandro Botticelli|Botticelli's]] ''[[The Birth of Venus (Botticelli)|The Birth of Venus]]'']]\n\nBetween the 4th and the 10th centuries Liguria was dominated by the [[Byzantine]]s, the [[Lombards]] of King [[Rothari]] (about 641) and the [[Franks]] (about 774). It was also invaded by [[Saracen]] and [[Normans|Norman]] raiders. In the 10th century, once the danger of pirates decreased, the Ligurian territory was divided into three marches: Obertenga (east), Arduinica (west) and Aleramica (centre). In the 11th and 12th centuries the marches were split into fees, and then with the strengthening of the bishops\u2019 power, the feudal structure began to partially weaken. The main Ligurian towns, especially on the coast, became city-states, over which [[Genoa]] soon extended its rule. Inland, however, fiefs belonging to noble families survived for a very long time.{{fix|text=vague}}\n\n[[File:Repubblica di Genova.png|thumbnail|250px|Territories of the [[Republic of Genoa]] (shown in purple).]]\n\nBetween the 11th century (when the Genoese ships played a major role in the first crusade, carrying knights and troops to the Middle-East for a fee) and the 15th century, the [[Republic of Genoa]] experienced an extraordinary political and commercial success (mainly spice trades with the Orient). It was one of the most powerful maritime republics in the [[Mediterranean]] from the 12th to the 14th century: after the decisive victory in the [[battle of Meloria (1284)]], it acquired control over the [[Tyrrhenian Sea]] and was present in the nerve centres of power during the last phase of the Byzantine empire, [[Genoese colonies|having colonies]] up to [[Black Sea]] and [[Crimean]].\n\nAfter the introduction of the title of doge for life (1339) and the election of [[Simone Boccanegra]], Genoa resumed its struggles against the [[Marquis of Finale]] and the Counts of [[Laigueglia]] and it conquered again the territories of [[Finale Ligure|Finale]], [[Oneglia]] and [[Porto Maurizio]]. In spite of its military and commercial successes, Genoa fell prey to the internal factions which put pressure on its political structure. Due to the vulnerable situation, the rule of the republic went to the hands of the [[Visconti of Milan|Visconti family]] of [[Milan]]. After their expulsion by the popular forces under Boccanegra's lead, the republic remained in Genoese hands until 1396, when the internal instability led the doge [[Antoniotto Adorno]] to surrender the title of Seignior of Genoa to the king of France. The French were driven away in 1409 and Liguria went back under Milanese control in 1421, thus remaining until 1435.\n\n===Early modern===\n\n[[File:Portrait of a Man, Said to be Christopher Columbus.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Posthumous portrait of [[Christopher Columbus]], by [[Sebastiano del Piombo]].]]\n\nThe alternation of French and Milanese dominions over Liguria went on until the first half of the 16th century. The French influence ceased in 1528, when [[Andrea Doria]] allied with the powerful king of Spain and imposed an aristocratic government, which gave the republic a relative stability for about 250 years.\n\n[[File:Louis14-Versailles1685.jpg|thumb|right|250px|''Reparation faite \u00e0 Louis XIV par le Doge de G\u00eanes.15 mai 1685'' by [[Claude Guy Halle]].]]\n\nGenoese explorer [[Christopher Columbus]]'s speculative proposal to reach the [[East Indies]] by sailing westward received the support of the Spanish crown, which saw in it an opportunity to gain the upper hand over rival powers in the contest for the lucrative [[spice trade]] with [[Asia]]. During his first voyage in 1492, instead of reaching Japan as he had intended, Columbus landed in the [[The Bahamas|Bahamas archipelago]], at a locale he named ''San Salvador''. Over the course of three more voyages, Columbus visited the [[Greater Antilles|Greater]] and [[Lesser Antilles]], as well as the [[Caribbean Sea|Caribbean]] coast of [[Venezuela]] and Central America, claiming them for the [[Spanish Empire]].\n\nThe value of trade routes through Genoa to the Near East declined during the [[Age of Discovery]], when Portuguese explorers discovered routes to Asia around the [[Cape of Good Hope]]. The international crises of the seventeenth century, which ended for Genoa with the 1684 [[Bombardment of Genoa|bombardment]] by [[Louis XIV]]\u2019s fleet, restored French influence over the republic. Consequently, the Ligurian territory was crossed by the [[Kingdom of Sardinia|Piedmontese]] and [[Holy Roman Empire|Austrian]] armies when these two states came into conflict with France.  Austria occupied Genoa in 1746, but the [[Habsburg]] troops were driven away by a popular insurrection. Napoleon's first Italian campaign marked the end of the oligarchic Genoese state, which was transformed into the [[Ligurian Republic]], modelled on the [[First French Republic|French Republic]]. After the union of Oneglia and Loano (1801), Liguria was annexed to the [[First French Empire|French Empire]] (1805) and divided by [[Napoleon]] into three departments: [[Montenotte (department)]], with capital [[Savona]], [[G\u00eanes]], with capital [[Genoa]] and the department of the [[Apennines]], with the capital [[Chiavari]].\n\n[[File:Mazzini.jpg|thumb|150px|[[Giuseppe Mazzini]] was a patriot, philosopher and politician of the 19th century.]]\n\n===Late modern and contemporary===\n\nAfter a short period of independence in 1814, the [[Congress of Vienna]] (1815) decided that Liguria should be annexed to the [[Kingdom of Sardinia]]. The Genoese uprising against the House of Savoy in 1821, which was put down with great bloodshed, aroused the population's national sentiments. Some of the most prestigious figures of ''[[Risorgimento]]'' were born in Liguria ([[Giuseppe Mazzini]], [[Goffredo Mameli|Mameli]], [[Nino Bixio]]). Italian patriot and general [[Giuseppe Garibaldi]], who was born in the neighbouring [[Nice]] (then part of the Sardinian state), started his [[Expedition of the Thousand]] on the evening of 5 May 1860 from a rock in Quarto, a quarter of Genoa.\n\nIn late 19th and early 20th century, the region's economic growth was remarkable: steel mills and ship yards flourished along the coast from [[Imperia]] to [[La Spezia]], while the port of Genoa became the main commercial hub of industrializing Northern Italy. During the tragic period of the [[Second World War]], Liguria experienced heavy bombings, hunger and two years of occupation by the [[Nazi|German]] troops, against whom a liberation struggle was led\u2014among the most effective in Italy. When Allied troops eventually entered Genoa, they were welcomed by Italian partisans who, in a successful insurrection, had freed the city and accepted the surrender of the local German command. For this feat the city has been awarded the gold medal for military valour.\n\n==Demographics==\n{{Historical populations\n|type =\n|footnote = Source: [[Istituto Nazionale di Statistica|ISTAT]] 2001\n|1861 |829000\n|1871 |884000\n|1881 |936000\n|1901 |1086000\n|1911 |1207000\n|1921 |1338000\n|1931 |1423000\n|1936 |1467000\n|1951 |1567000\n|1961 |1735000\n|1971 |1854000\n|1981 |1808000\n|1991 |1676000\n|2001 |1572000\n|2011 |1617000\n|2017 |1557533\n}}\n\nThe population density of Liguria is much higher than the national average (300 inhabitants per km<sup>2</sup>, or 770 per sq mi), being only less than [[Campania]]'s, [[Lombardy]]'s and [[Lazio]]'s.

Since these are all coastal regions, the shared formant may relate to a shared descent from pre-Indo-European, maritime peoples, <ref>Room, \"Placenames of the World,\" 2006</ref><ref>Marie Henri d'Arbois de Jubainville, Premiers Habitants de l'Europe (2nd edition 1889-1894)</ref> and/or the hypothetical [[Tyrsenian languages|Tyrsenian]] and [[Vasconic]] language families resectively. This argument is weakened, however, by the fact that the name Etruscan is a relatively late [[exonym]] and the relevant endonym, used\nof the Etruscans themselves, was ''Rasenna'' or ''Ra\u015bna''. (In Greek this mutated into  ''Turs\u0113noi''  and ''Tyrr\u0113noi''; in Latin it became ''Etruria'' and ''Toscana''.)\n\n==Geography==\n[[File:Spezia monterosso.jpg|thumb|left|150px|A view of [[Cinque Terre]].]]\nLiguria is bordered by [[France]] ([[Provence-Alpes-C\u00f4te d'Azur]]) to the west, [[Piedmont]] to the north, and [[Emilia-Romagna]] and [[Tuscany]] to the east.

Except for the [[Portovenere]] and [[Portofino]] promontories, the coast is generally not very jagged, and is often high. At the mouths of the biggest watercourses are small beaches, but there are no deep bays and natural harbours except at [[Genoa]] and [[La Spezia]].\n\nThe hills lying immediately beyond the coast together with the sea account for a mild climate year-round. Average winter temperatures are {{convert|7|to|10|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|abbr=on}} and summer temperatures are {{convert|23|to|24|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|abbr=on}}, which make for a pleasant stay even in the dead of winter. Rainfall can be abundant at times, as mountains very close to the coast create an [[orographic]] effect. Genoa and [[La Spezia]] can see up to {{convert|2000|mm|-1|abbr=on}} of rain in a year; other areas instead show the normal Mediterranean rainfall of {{convert|500|to|800|mm|-1|abbr=on}} annually.\n\n==History==\n{{see also|List of museums in Liguria}}\n\n===Prehistory and Roman times===\n\n[[File:Regio IX Liguria.jpg|250px|thumbnail|Map of Roman Liguria, between the River [[Var (river)|Var]] and [[Magra]].]]\n[[File:La Ligurie de Mercator 1576.jpg|250px|thumbnail|Map of ancient Liguria, between the river [[Var (river)|Var]] and [[Magra]]. [[Cannes]] is annexed by France in [[Middle Ages]].]]\n[[File:County of nice.svg|250px|thumb|[[County of Nice]] western part of Liguria annexed by France in 1860.]]\n\nAccording to classical sources, the Ligurians ([[Ligures]]) once lived in a far broader territory than present-day Liguria. For example, the Greek colony of [[Marseille|Massalia]], modern [[Marseille]]{{Citation needed|reason=no source mentions this|date=March 2020}}, was recorded to lie in Ligurian territory.\n\n[[File:Luna Amphitheater1.jpg|thumb|250px|The Roman amphitheatre of [[Luni, Italy|Luni]] (1st century AD).]]\n\nDuring the first [[Punic War]], the ancient Ligurians were divided, some of them siding with [[Carthage]] and a minority with Rome, whose allies included the future [[Republic of Genoa|Genoese]]. Under [[Augustus]], Liguria was designated a [[Augustan regions of Italy|region of Italy]] (''Regio IX Liguria'') stretching from the coast to the banks of the [[Po River]]. The great Roman roads (Aurelia and Julia Augusta on the coast, Postumia and Aemilia Scauri towards the inland) helped strengthen territorial unity and increase communication and trade. Important towns developed on the coast, of which evidence is left in the ruins of [[Albenga]], Ventimiglia and [[Luni, Italy|Luni]].\n\n===Middle Ages===\n\n[[File:Strabismo di Venere - Botticelli.jpg|thumb|left|150px|[[Simonetta Vespucci]], a native Ligurian who was a famous beauty during the Renaissance, may have been the model for [[Sandro Botticelli|Botticelli's]] ''[[The Birth of Venus (Botticelli)|The Birth of Venus]]'']]\n\nBetween the 4th and the 10th centuries Liguria was dominated by the [[Byzantine]]s, the [[Lombards]] of King [[Rothari]] (about 641) and the [[Franks]] (about 774). It was also invaded by [[Saracen]] and [[Normans|Norman]] raiders. In the 10th century, once the danger of pirates decreased, the Ligurian territory was divided into three marches: Obertenga (east), Arduinica (west) and Aleramica (centre). In the 11th and 12th centuries the marches were split into fees, and then with the strengthening of the bishops\u2019 power, the feudal structure began to partially weaken. The main Ligurian towns, especially on the coast, became city-states, over which [[Genoa]] soon extended its rule. Inland, however, fiefs belonging to noble families survived for a very long time.{{fix|text=vague}}\n\n[[File:Repubblica di Genova.png|thumbnail|250px|Territories of the [[Republic of Genoa]] (shown in purple).]]\n\nBetween the 11th century (when the Genoese ships played a major role in the first crusade, carrying knights and troops to the Middle-East for a fee) and the 15th century, the [[Republic of Genoa]] experienced an extraordinary political and commercial success (mainly spice trades with the Orient). It was one of the most powerful maritime republics in the [[Mediterranean]] from the 12th to the 14th century: after the decisive victory in the [[battle of Meloria (1284)]], it acquired control over the [[Tyrrhenian Sea]] and was present in the nerve centres of power during the last phase of the Byzantine empire, [[Genoese colonies|having colonies]] up to [[Black Sea]] and [[Crimean]].\n\nAfter the introduction of the title of doge for life (1339) and the election of [[Simone Boccanegra]], Genoa resumed its struggles against the [[Marquis of Finale]] and the Counts of [[Laigueglia]] and it conquered again the territories of [[Finale Ligure|Finale]], [[Oneglia]] and [[Porto Maurizio]]. In spite of its military and commercial successes, Genoa fell prey to the internal factions which put pressure on its political structure. Due to the vulnerable situation, the rule of the republic went to the hands of the [[Visconti of Milan|Visconti family]] of [[Milan]]. After their expulsion by the popular forces under Boccanegra's lead, the republic remained in Genoese hands until 1396, when the internal instability led the doge [[Antoniotto Adorno]] to surrender the title of Seignior of Genoa to the king of France. The French were driven away in 1409 and Liguria went back under Milanese control in 1421, thus remaining until 1435.\n\n===Early modern===\n\n[[File:Portrait of a Man, Said to be Christopher Columbus.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Posthumous portrait of [[Christopher Columbus]], by [[Sebastiano del Piombo]].]]\n\nThe alternation of French and Milanese dominions over Liguria went on until the first half of the 16th century. The French influence ceased in 1528, when [[Andrea Doria]] allied with the powerful king of Spain and imposed an aristocratic government, which gave the republic a relative stability for about 250 years.\n\n[[File:Louis14-Versailles1685.jpg|thumb|right|250px|''Reparation faite \u00e0 Louis XIV par le Doge de G\u00eanes.15 mai 1685'' by [[Claude Guy Halle]].]]\n\nGenoese explorer [[Christopher Columbus]]'s speculative proposal to reach the [[East Indies]] by sailing westward received the support of the Spanish crown, which saw in it an opportunity to gain the upper hand over rival powers in the contest for the lucrative [[spice trade]] with [[Asia]]. During his first voyage in 1492, instead of reaching Japan as he had intended, Columbus landed in the [[The Bahamas|Bahamas archipelago]], at a locale he named ''San Salvador''. Over the course of three more voyages, Columbus visited the [[Greater Antilles|Greater]] and [[Lesser Antilles]], as well as the [[Caribbean Sea|Caribbean]] coast of [[Venezuela]] and Central America, claiming them for the [[Spanish Empire]].\n\nThe value of trade routes through Genoa to the Near East declined during the [[Age of Discovery]], when Portuguese explorers discovered routes to Asia around the [[Cape of Good Hope]]. The international crises of the seventeenth century, which ended for Genoa with the 1684 [[Bombardment of Genoa|bombardment]] by [[Louis XIV]]\u2019s fleet, restored French influence over the republic. Consequently, the Ligurian territory was crossed by the [[Kingdom of Sardinia|Piedmontese]] and [[Holy Roman Empire|Austrian]] armies when these two states came into conflict with France.  Austria occupied Genoa in 1746, but the [[Habsburg]] troops were driven away by a popular insurrection. Napoleon's first Italian campaign marked the end of the oligarchic Genoese state, which was transformed into the [[Ligurian Republic]], modelled on the [[First French Republic|French Republic]]. After the union of Oneglia and Loano (1801), Liguria was annexed to the [[First French Empire|French Empire]] (1805) and divided by [[Napoleon]] into three departments: [[Montenotte (department)]], with capital [[Savona]], [[G\u00eanes]], with capital [[Genoa]] and the department of the [[Apennines]], with the capital [[Chiavari]].\n\n[[File:Mazzini.jpg|thumb|150px|[[Giuseppe Mazzini]] was a patriot, philosopher and politician of the 19th century.]]\n\n===Late modern and contemporary===\n\nAfter a short period of independence in 1814, the [[Congress of Vienna]] (1815) decided that Liguria should be annexed to the [[Kingdom of Sardinia]]. The Genoese uprising against the House of Savoy in 1821, which was put down with great bloodshed, aroused the population's national sentiments. Some of the most prestigious figures of ''[[Risorgimento]]'' were born in Liguria ([[Giuseppe Mazzini]], [[Goffredo Mameli|Mameli]], [[Nino Bixio]]). Italian patriot and general [[Giuseppe Garibaldi]], who was born in the neighbouring [[Nice]] (then part of the Sardinian state), started his [[Expedition of the Thousand]] on the evening of 5 May 1860 from a rock in Quarto, a quarter of Genoa.\n\nIn late 19th and early 20th century, the region's economic growth was remarkable: steel mills and ship yards flourished along the coast from [[Imperia]] to [[La Spezia]], while the port of Genoa became the main commercial hub of industrializing Northern Italy. During the tragic period of the [[Second World War]], Liguria experienced heavy bombings, hunger and two years of occupation by the [[Nazi|German]] troops, against whom a liberation struggle was led\u2014among the most effective in Italy. When Allied troops eventually entered Genoa, they were welcomed by Italian partisans who, in a successful insurrection, had freed the city and accepted the surrender of the local German command. For this feat the city has been awarded the gold medal for military valour.\n\n==Demographics==\n{{Historical populations\n|type =\n|footnote = Source: [[Istituto Nazionale di Statistica|ISTAT]] 2001\n|1861 |829000\n|1871 |884000\n|1881 |936000\n|1901 |1086000\n|1911 |1207000\n|1921 |1338000\n|1931 |1423000\n|1936 |1467000\n|1951 |1567000\n|1961 |1735000\n|1971 |1854000\n|1981 |1808000\n|1991 |1676000\n|2001 |1572000\n|2011 |1617000\n|2017 |1557533\n}}\n\nThe population density of Liguria is much higher than the national average (300 inhabitants per km<sup>2</sup>, or 770 per sq mi), being only less than [[Campania]]'s, [[Lombardy]]'s and [[Lazio]]'s.

{"title_page": "Microbial metabolism", "text_new": "'''Microbial metabolism''' is the means by which a [[microbe]] obtains the energy and nutrients (e.g. [[carbon]]) it needs to live and reproduce.  Microbes use many different types of [[metabolism|metabolic]] strategies and species can often be differentiated from each other based on metabolic characteristics.  The specific metabolic properties of a microbe are the major factors in determining that microbe's [[ecological niche]], and often allow for that microbe to be useful in [[biotechnology|industrial processes]] or responsible for [[biogeochemistry|biogeochemical]] cycles.\n\n\n\n1. How the organism obtains carbon for synthesising cell mass:\n* '''[[autotroph]]ic''' \u2013 carbon is obtained from [[carbon dioxide]] ({{CO2}})\n* '''[[heterotroph]]ic''' \u2013 carbon is obtained from [[organic compound]]s\n* '''[[mixotroph]]ic''' \u2013 carbon is obtained from both organic compounds and by fixing carbon dioxide\n2. How the organism obtains [[reducing equivalent]]s used either in energy conservation or in biosynthetic reactions:\n* '''[[lithotroph]]ic''' \u2013 reducing equivalents are obtained from [[inorganic compound]]s\n* '''[[organotroph]]ic''' \u2013 reducing equivalents are obtained from organic compounds\n3. How the organism obtains energy for living and growing:\n* '''[[chemotroph]]ic''' \u2013 energy is obtained from external [[chemical compound]]s\n* '''[[phototroph]]ic''' \u2013 energy is obtained from light\n\nIn practice, these terms are almost freely combined. Typical examples are as follows:\n\n* '''chemolithoautotrophs''' obtain energy from the oxidation of inorganic compounds and carbon from the fixation of carbon dioxide. Examples: [[Nitrifying bacteria]], Sulfur-oxidizing bacteria, [[Iron-oxidizing bacteria]], [[Knallgas-bacteria]]\n* '''photolithoautotrophs''' obtain energy from light and carbon from the fixation of carbon dioxide, using reducing equivalents from inorganic compounds. Examples: [[Cyanobacteria]] (water ({{chem|H|2|O}}) as reducing equivalent donor), [[Chlorobiaceae]], [[Chromatiaceae]] (hydrogen sulfide ({{chem|link=Hydrogen sulfide|H|2|S}}) as reducing equivalent donor), ''[[Chloroflexus]]'' (hydrogen ({{chem|H|2}}) as reducing equivalent donor)\n* '''chemolithoheterotrophs''' obtain energy from the oxidation of inorganic compounds, but cannot fix carbon dioxide ({{CO2}}). Examples: some ''[[Hydrogenophilaceae|Thiobacilus]]'', some ''[[Beggiatoa]]'', some ''[[Nitrobacter]]'' spp., ''[[Wolinella]]'' (with {{chem|H|2}} as reducing equivalent donor), some [[Knallgas-bacteria]], some [[sulfate-reducing bacteria]]\n* '''chemoorganoheterotrophs''' obtain energy, carbon, and reducing equivalents for biosynthetic reactions from organic compounds. Examples: most bacteria, e. g. ''[[Escherichia coli]]'', ''[[Bacillus]]'' spp., ''[[Actinobacteria]]''\n* '''photoorganoheterotrophs''' obtain energy from light, carbon and reducing equivalents for biosynthetic reactions from organic compounds. Some species are strictly heterotrophic, many others can also fix carbon dioxide and are mixotrophic. Examples: ''[[Rhodobacter]]'', ''[[Rhodopseudomonas]]'', ''[[Rhodospirillum]]'', ''[[Rhodomicrobium]]'', ''[[Rhodocyclus]]'', ''[[Heliobacteria|Heliobacterium]]'', ''[[Chloroflexus]]'' (alternatively to photolithoautotrophy with hydrogen)\n\n==Heterotrophic microbial metabolism==\n\nSome microbes are heterotrophic (more precisely chemoorganoheterotrophic), using organic compounds as both carbon and energy sources. Heterotrophic microbes live off of nutrients that they scavenge from living hosts (as [[commensals]] or [[parasite]]s) or find in dead organic matter of all kind ([[saprophage]]s). Microbial metabolism is the main contribution for the bodily decay of all organisms after death. Many [[eukaryotic]] microorganisms are heterotrophic by [[predation]] or [[parasitism]], properties also found in some bacteria such as ''[[Bdellovibrio]]'' (an intracellular parasite of other bacteria, causing death of its victims) and Myxobacteria such as ''[[Myxococcus]]'' (predators of other bacteria which are killed and lysed by cooperating swarms of many single cells of Myxobacteria). Most [[pathogen]]ic bacteria can be viewed as heterotrophic parasites of humans or the other eukaryotic species they affect. Heterotrophic microbes are extremely abundant in nature and are responsible for the breakdown of large organic [[polymer]]s such as [[cellulose]], [[chitin]] or [[lignin]] which are generally indigestible to larger animals. Generally, the breakdown of large polymers to carbon dioxide ([[Mineralization (biology)|mineralization]]) requires several different organisms, with one breaking down the polymer into its constituent monomers, one able to use the monomers and excreting simpler waste compounds as by-products, and one able to use the excreted wastes.  There are many variations on this theme, as different organisms are able to degrade different polymers and secrete different waste products.  Some organisms are even able to degrade more recalcitrant compounds such as petroleum compounds or pesticides, making them useful in [[bioremediation]].\n\nBiochemically, [[prokaryotic]] heterotrophic metabolism is much more versatile than that of [[eukaryotic]] organisms, although many prokaryotes share the most basic metabolic models with eukaryotes, e. g. using [[glycolysis]] (also called [[Embden-Meyerhoff-Parnas|EMP pathway]]) for sugar metabolism and the [[citric acid cycle]] to degrade [[acetate]], producing energy in the form of [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]] and reducing power in the form of [[NADH]] or [[quinols]].  These basic pathways are well conserved because they are also involved in biosynthesis of many conserved building blocks needed for cell growth (sometimes in reverse direction).  However, many [[bacteria]] and [[archaea]] utilize alternative metabolic pathways other than glycolysis and the citric acid cycle.  A well-studied example is sugar metabolism via the [[KDPG pathway|keto-deoxy-phosphogluconate pathway]] (also called [[Entner\u2013Doudoroff pathway|ED pathway]]) in ''[[Pseudomonas]]''.  Moreover, there is a third alternative sugar-catabolic pathway used by some bacteria, the [[pentose phosphate pathway]]. The metabolic diversity and ability of prokaryotes to use a large variety of organic compounds arises from the much deeper evolutionary history and diversity of prokaryotes, as compared to eukaryotes.  It is also noteworthy that the [[mitochondrion]], the small membrane-bound intracellular organelle that is the site of eukaryotic energy metabolism, arose from the [[endosymbiosis]] of a [[bacterium]] related to obligate intracellular ''[[Rickettsia]]'', and also to plant-associated ''[[Rhizobium]]'' or ''[[Agrobacterium]]''.  Therefore, it is not surprising that all mitrochondriate eukaryotes share metabolic properties with these [[Proteobacteria]].  Most microbes [[Cellular respiration|respire]] (use an [[electron transport chain]]), although [[oxygen]] is not the only [[terminal electron acceptor]] that may be used.  As discussed below, the use of terminal electron acceptors other than oxygen has important biogeochemical consequences.\n\n==Fermentation==\n{{main|Fermentation (biochemistry)}}\n\nFermentation is a specific type of heterotrophic metabolism that uses [[organic compound|organic carbon]] instead of oxygen as a terminal electron acceptor.  This means that these organisms do not use an electron transport chain to oxidize NADH to {{chem|NAD|+}} and therefore must have an alternative method of using this reducing power and maintaining a supply of {{chem|NAD|+}} for the proper functioning of normal metabolic pathways (e.g. glycolysis).  As oxygen is not required, fermentative organisms are [[Anaerobic organism|anaerobic]].  Many organisms can use fermentation under anaerobic conditions and [[aerobic respiration]] when oxygen is present.  These organisms are [[facultative anaerobe]]s.  To avoid the overproduction of NADH, [[Obligate anaerobe|obligately]] fermentative organisms usually do not have a complete citric acid cycle.  Instead of using an [[ATP synthase]] as in [[Cellular respiration|respiration]], ATP in fermentative organisms is produced by [[substrate-level phosphorylation]] where a [[phosphate]] group is transferred from a high-energy organic compound to [[Adenosine diphosphate|ADP]] to form ATP.  As a result of the need to produce high energy phosphate-containing organic compounds (generally in the form of [[Coenzyme A]]-esters) fermentative organisms use NADH and other [[cofactor (biochemistry)|cofactor]]s to produce many different reduced metabolic by-products, often including [[hydrogen]] gas ({{chem|H|2}}). These reduced organic compounds are generally small [[organic acid]]s and [[alcohol]]s derived from [[pyruvic acid|pyruvate]], the end product of [[glycolysis]]. Examples include [[ethanol]], [[acetic acid|acetate]], [[lactic acid|lactate]], and [[butyric acid|butyrate]]. Fermentative organisms are very important industrially and are used to make many different types of food products. The different metabolic end products produced by each specific bacterial species are responsible for the different tastes and properties of each food.\n\nNot all fermentative organisms use substrate-level [[phosphorylation]]. Instead, some organisms are able to couple the oxidation of low-energy organic compounds directly to the formation of a [[proton motive force|proton (or sodium) motive force]] and therefore [[ATP synthesis]].  Examples of these unusual forms of fermentation include [[succinate]] fermentation by ''[[Propionigenium modestum]]'' and [[oxalate]] fermentation by ''[[Oxalobacter formigenes]]''. These reactions are extremely low-energy yielding.  Humans and other higher animals also use fermentation to produce [[Lactic acid|lactate]] from excess NADH, although this is not the major form of metabolism as it is in fermentative microorganisms.\n\n==Special metabolic properties==\n\n===Methylotrophy===\n\nMethylotrophy refers to the ability of an organism to use [[C1-compounds]] as energy sources. These compounds include [[methanol]], [[methyl amine]]s, [[formaldehyde]], and [[formic acid|formate]].  Several other less common substrates may also be used for metabolism, all of which lack carbon-carbon bonds. Examples of methylotrophs include the bacteria ''[[Methylomonas]]'' and ''[[Methylobacter]]''. [[Methanotroph]]s are a specific type of methylotroph that are also able to use [[methane]] ({{chem|CH|4}}) as a carbon source by oxidizing it sequentially to methanol ({{chem|CH|3|OH}}), formaldehyde ({{chem|CH|2|O}}), formate ({{chem|HCOO|-}}), and carbon dioxide {{CO2}} initially using the enzyme [[methane monooxygenase]].  As oxygen is required for this process, all (conventional) methanotrophs are [[obligate aerobe]]s.  Reducing power in the form of [[quinone]]s and NADH is produced during these oxidations to produce a proton motive force and therefore ATP generation.  Methylotrophs and methanotrophs are not considered as autotrophic, because they are able to incorporate some of the oxidized methane (or other metabolites) into cellular carbon before it is completely oxidized to {{CO2}} (at the level of formaldehyde), using either the [[serine pathway]] (''[[Methylosinus]]'', ''[[Methylocystis]]'') or the [[ribulose monophosphate pathway]] (''[[Methylococcus]]''), depending on the species of methylotroph.\n\nIn addition to aerobic methylotrophy, methane can also be oxidized anaerobically. This occurs by a consortium of sulfate-reducing bacteria and relatives of [[methanogen]]ic [[Archaea]] working syntrophically (see below). Little is currently known about the biochemistry and ecology of this process.\n\n[[Methanogenesis]] is the biological production of methane.  It is carried out by methanogens, strictly [[Anaerobic organism|anaerobic]] Archaea such as ''[[Methanococcus]]'', ''[[Methanocaldococcus]]'', ''[[Methanobacterium]]'',\n''[[Methanothermus]]'', ''[[Methanosarcina]]'', ''[[Methanosaeta]]'' and ''[[Methanopyrus]]''.  The biochemistry of methanogenesis is unique in nature in its use of a number of unusual [[cofactor (biochemistry)|cofactor]]s to sequentially reduce methanogenic substrates to methane, such as [[coenzyme M]] and [[methanofuran]].<ref>{{cite journal  |vauthors=DiMarco AA, Bobik TA, Wolfe RS |title=Unusual coenzymes of methanogenesis |journal=Annu. Rev. Biochem. |volume=59 |pages=355&ndash;94 |year=1990 |pmid=2115763 |doi=10.1146/annurev.bi.59.070190.002035}}</ref>  These cofactors are responsible (among other things) for the establishment of a [[proton]] gradient across the outer membrane thereby driving ATP synthesis.  Several types of methanogenesis occur, differing in the starting compounds oxidized.  Some methanogens reduce carbon dioxide ({{CO2}}) to methane ({{chem|CH|4}}) using electrons (most often) from hydrogen gas ({{chem|H|2}})  chemolithoautotrophically.  These methanogens can often be found in environments containing fermentative organisms.  The tight association of methanogens and fermentative bacteria can be considered to be syntrophic (see below) because the methanogens, which rely on the fermentors for hydrogen, relieve feedback inhibition of the fermentors by the build-up of excess hydrogen that would otherwise inhibit their growth.  This type of syntrophic relationship is specifically known as [[interspecies hydrogen transfer]].  A second group of methanogens use methanol ({{chem|CH|3|OH}}) as a substrate for methanogenesis. These are chemoorganotrophic, but still autotrophic in using {{CO2}} as only carbon source.  The biochemistry of this process is quite different from that of the carbon dioxide-reducing methanogens.  Lastly, a third group of methanogens produce both methane and carbon dioxide from [[acetate]] ({{chem|CH|3|COO|-}}) with the acetate being split between the two carbons. These acetate-cleaving organisms are the only chemoorganoheterotrophic methanogens.  All autotrophic methanogens use a variation of the [[reductive acetyl-CoA pathway]] to fix {{CO2}} and obtain cellular carbon.\n\n===Syntrophy===\n\nSyntrophy, in the context of microbial metabolism, refers to the pairing of multiple species to achieve a [[chemical reaction]] that, on its own, would be energetically unfavorable.  The best studied example of this process is the oxidation of fermentative end products (such as acetate, [[ethanol]] and [[butyrate]]) by organisms such as ''[[Syntrophomonas]]''.  Alone, the oxidation of butyrate to acetate and hydrogen gas is energetically unfavorable.  However, when a [[hydrogenotrophic]] (hydrogen-using) methanogen is present the use of the hydrogen gas will significantly lower the concentration of hydrogen (down to 10<sup>\u22125</sup> atm) and thereby shift the [[Chemical equilibrium|equilibrium]] of the butyrate oxidation reaction under standard conditions (\u0394G\u00ba\u2019) to non-standard conditions (\u0394G\u2019). Because the concentration of one product is lowered, the reaction is \"pulled\" towards the products and shifted towards net energetically favorable conditions (for butyrate oxidation: \u0394G\u00ba\u2019= +48.2 kJ/mol, but \u0394G' = -8.9 kJ/mol at 10<sup>\u22125</sup> atm hydrogen and even lower if also the initially produced acetate is further metabolized by methanogens). Conversely, the available free energy from methanogenesis is lowered from \u0394G\u00ba\u2019= -131 kJ/mol under standard conditions to \u0394G' = -17 kJ/mol at 10<sup>\u22125</sup> atm hydrogen. This is an example of intraspecies hydrogen transfer.  In this way, low energy-yielding carbon sources can be used by a consortium of organisms to achieve further degradation and eventual [[mineralization (biology)|mineralization]] of these compounds.  These reactions help prevent the excess sequestration of carbon over geologic time scales, releasing it back to the biosphere in usable forms such as methane and {{CO2}}.\n\n==Anaerobic respiration==\n\nWhile [[aerobic organism]]s during respiration use oxygen as a [[terminal electron acceptor]], [[anaerobic organism]]s use other electron acceptors. These inorganic compounds have a lower reduction potential than oxygen, meaning that [[Cellular respiration|respiration]] is less efficient in these organisms and leads to slower growth rates than aerobes. Many [[facultative anaerobe]]s can use either oxygen or alternative terminal electron acceptors for respiration depending on the environmental conditions.\n\nMost respiring anaerobes are heterotrophs, although some do live autotrophically. All of the processes described below are dissimilative, meaning that they are used during energy production and not to provide nutrients for the cell (assimilative). Assimilative pathways for many forms of [[anaerobic respiration]] are also known.\n\n===Denitrification \u2013 nitrate as electron acceptor===\n{{main|Denitrification}}\n\nDenitrification is the utilization of [[nitrate]] ({{chem|NO|3|-}}) as a terminal electron acceptor.  It is a widespread process that is used by many members of the Proteobacteria.  Many facultative anaerobes use denitrification because nitrate, like oxygen, has a high reduction potential.  Many denitrifying bacteria can also use ferric [[iron]] ({{chem|Fe|3+}}) and some organic [[electron acceptor]]s.  Denitrification involves the stepwise reduction of nitrate to [[nitrite]] ({{chem|NO|2|-}}), [[nitric oxide]] (NO), [[nitrous oxide]] ({{chem|N|2|O}}), and dinitrogen ({{chem|N|2}}) by the enzymes [[nitrate reductase]], [[nitrite reductase]], nitric oxide reductase, and nitrous oxide reductase, respectively.  Protons are transported across the membrane by the initial NADH reductase, quinones, and nitrous oxide reductase to produce the electrochemical gradient critical for respiration.  Some organisms (e.g. ''[[E. coli]]'') only produce nitrate reductase and therefore can accomplish only the first reduction leading to the accumulation of nitrite.  Others (e.g. ''[[Paracoccus denitrificans]]'' or ''[[Pseudomonas stutzeri]]'') reduce nitrate completely.  Complete denitrification is an environmentally significant process because some intermediates of denitrification (nitric oxide and nitrous oxide) are important [[greenhouse gas]]es that react with [[sunlight]] and [[ozone]] to produce nitric acid, a component of [[acid rain]].  Denitrification is also important in biological [[wastewater]] treatment where it is used to reduce the amount of nitrogen released into the environment thereby reducing [[eutrophication]]. Denitrification can be determined via a [[nitrate reductase test]].\n\n===Sulfate reduction \u2013 sulfate as electron acceptor===\n{{main|Sulfate-reducing bacteria}}\n\n[[Dissimilatory sulfate reduction]] is a relatively energetically poor process used by many Gram-negative bacteria found within the [[deltaproteobacteria]], Gram-positive organisms relating to ''[[Desulfotomaculum]]'' or the archaeon ''[[Archaeoglobus]]''. [[Hydrogen sulfide]] ({{chem|H|2|S}}) is produced as a metabolic end product. For sulfate reduction electron donors and energy are needed.\n\n====Electron donors====\n\nMany sulfate reducers are organotrophic, using carbon compounds such as lactate and pyruvate (among many others) as [[electron donor]]s,<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Ishimoto M, Koyama J, Nagai Y |title=Biochemical Studies on Sulfate-Reducing Bacteria: IV.

Because sulfate is energetically stable, before it can be metabolized it must first be activated by adenylation to form APS (adenosine 5\u2019-phosphosulfate) thereby consuming ATP.  The APS is then reduced by the enzyme APS reductase to form [[sulfite]] ({{chem|SO|3|2\u2212}}) and [[Adenosine monophosphate|AMP]].  In organisms that use carbon compounds as electron donors, the ATP consumed is accounted for by fermentation of the carbon substrate.  The hydrogen produced during fermentation is actually what drives respiration during sulfate reduction.\n\n===Acetogenesis \u2013 carbon dioxide as electron acceptor===\n{{main|Acetogenesis}}\n\nAcetogenesis is a type of microbial metabolism that uses hydrogen ({{chem|H|2}}) as an electron donor and carbon dioxide ({{CO2}}) as an electron acceptor to produce acetate, the same electron donors and acceptors used in methanogenesis (see above).  Bacteria that can autotrophically synthesize acetate are called homoacetogens.  Carbon dioxide [[Redox|reduction]] in all homoacetogens occurs by the acetyl-CoA pathway.  This pathway is also used for carbon fixation by autotrophic sulfate-reducing bacteria and hydrogenotrophic methanogens.  Often homoacetogens can also be fermentative, using the hydrogen and carbon dioxide produced as a result of fermentation to produce acetate, which is secreted as an end product.\n\n===Other inorganic electron acceptors===\n\nFerric iron ({{chem|Fe|3+}}) is a widespread anaerobic terminal electron acceptor both for autotrophic and heterotrophic organisms.  Electron flow in these organisms is similar to those in [[electron transport]], ending in oxygen or nitrate, except that in ferric iron-reducing organisms the final enzyme in this system is a ferric iron reductase.  Model organisms include ''[[Shewanella putrefaciens]]'' and ''[[Geobacter|Geobacter metallireducens]]''.  Since some ferric iron-reducing bacteria (e.g. ''G. metallireducens'') can use toxic [[hydrocarbon]]s such as [[toluene]] as a carbon source, there is significant interest in using these organisms as bioremediation agents in ferric iron-rich contaminated [[aquifer]]s.\n\nAlthough ferric iron is the most prevalent inorganic electron acceptor, a number of organisms (including the iron-reducing bacteria mentioned above) can use other [[inorganic]] ions in anaerobic respiration.  While these processes may often be less significant ecologically, they are of considerable interest for bioremediation, especially when [[heavy metals]] or [[radionuclide]]s are used as electron acceptors.  Examples include:\n* [[Manganese|Manganic ion]] ({{chem|Mn|4+}}) reduction to [[manganous ion]] ({{chem|Mn|2+}})\n* [[Selenium|Selenate]] ({{chem|SeO|4|2-}}) reduction to [[Selenium|selenite]] ({{chem|SeO|3|2-}}) and selenite reduction to inorganic [[selenium]] (Se<sup>0</sup>)\n* [[Arsenic|Arsenate]] ({{chem|AsO|4|3-}}) reduction to [[arsenic|arsenite]] ({{chem|AsO|3|3-}})\n* [[Uranyl|Uranyl ion]] ion ({{chem|UO|2|2+}}) reduction to [[uranium dioxide]] ({{chem|UO|2}})\n\n===Organic terminal electron acceptors===\n\nA number of organisms, instead of using inorganic compounds as terminal electron acceptors, are able to use organic compounds to accept electrons from respiration.  Examples include:\n* [[Fumarate]] reduction to [[succinate]]\n* [[Trimethylamine N-oxide|Trimethylamine ''N''-oxide]] (TMAO) reduction to [[trimethylamine]] (TMA)\n* [[Dimethyl sulfoxide]] (DMSO) reduction to [[Dimethyl sulfide]] (DMS)\n* Reductive dechlorination\nTMAO is a chemical commonly produced by [[fish]], and when reduced to TMA produces a strong odor.  DMSO is a common marine and freshwater chemical which is also odiferous when reduced to DMS.  Reductive dechlorination is the process by which chlorinated organic compounds are reduced to form their non-chlorinated endproducts.  As chlorinated organic compounds are often important (and difficult to degrade) environmental pollutants, reductive dechlorination is an important process in bioremediation.\n\n==Chemolithotrophy==\n\n[[Chemolithotrophy]] is a type of metabolism where energy is obtained from the oxidation of inorganic compounds.  Most chemolithotrophic organisms are also autotrophic.  There are two major objectives to chemolithotrophy: the generation of energy (ATP) and the generation of reducing power (NADH).\n\n===Hydrogen oxidation===\n{{main|Hydrogen oxidizing bacteria}}\nMany organisms are capable of using hydrogen ({{chem|H|2}}) as a source of energy.  While several mechanisms of anaerobic hydrogen [[oxidation]] have been mentioned previously (e.g. sulfate reducing- and acetogenic bacteria), hydrogen can also be used as an energy source aerobically in the knallgas reaction:<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/oi/authority.20110803100040856| title=knallgas reaction| publisher=Oxford Reference |access-date=August 19, 2017}}</ref>\n\n:2 H<sub>2</sub> + O<sub>2</sub> \u2192 2 H<sub>2</sub>O + energy\n\nIn these organisms, hydrogen is oxidized by a membrane-bound [[hydrogenase]] causing proton pumping via electron transfer to various quinones and [[cytochrome]]s.  In many organisms, a second cytoplasmic hydrogenase is used to generate reducing power in the form of NADH, which is subsequently used to fix carbon dioxide via the [[Calvin cycle]].  Hydrogen-oxidizing organisms, such as ''Cupriavidus necator'' (formerly ''[[Ralstonia eutropha]]''), often inhabit oxic-anoxic interfaces in nature to take advantage of the hydrogen produced by anaerobic fermentative organisms while still maintaining a supply of oxygen.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Jugder|first=Bat-Erdene|last2=Welch|first2=Jeffrey|last3=Aguey-Zinsou|first3=Kondo-Francois|last4=Marquis|first4=Christopher P.|date=2013|title=Fundamentals and electrochemical applications of [Ni\u2013Fe]-uptake hydrogenases|journal=RSC Advances|volume=3|issue=22|pages=8142|doi=10.1039/c3ra22668a|issn=2046-2069}}</ref>\n\n===Sulfur oxidation===\n\nSulfur oxidation involves the oxidation of reduced sulfur compounds (such as sulfide {{chem|H|2|S}}), inorganic sulfur (S), and thiosulfate ({{chem|S|2|O|3|2-}}) to form [[sulfuric acid]] ({{chem|H|2|SO|4}}).  A classic example of a sulfur-oxidizing bacterium is ''[[Beggiatoa]]'', a microbe originally described by [[Sergei Winogradsky]], one of the founders of [[environmental microbiology]]. Another example is ''[[Paracoccus]]''. Generally, the oxidation of sulfide occurs in stages, with inorganic sulfur being stored either inside or outside of the cell until needed.  This two step process occurs because energetically sulfide is a better electron donor than inorganic sulfur or thiosulfate, allowing for a greater number of protons to be translocated across the membrane.  Sulfur-oxidizing organisms generate reducing power for carbon dioxide fixation via the Calvin cycle using [[reverse electron flow]], an energy-requiring process that pushes the electrons against their [[thermodynamic]] gradient to produce NADH.  Biochemically, reduced sulfur compounds are converted to sulfite ({{chem|SO|3|2\u2212}}) and subsequently converted to sulfate ({{chem|SO|4|2\u2212}}) by the enzyme [[sulfite oxidase]].<ref name=\"sulfite\">{{cite journal |vauthors=Kappler U, Bennett B, Rethmeier J, Schwarz G, Deutzmann R, McEwan AG, Dahl C |title= Sulfite:Cytochrome ''c'' Oxidoreductase from ''Thiobacillus novellus''.

In all cases the energy liberated is transferred to the electron transport chain for ATP and NADH production.<ref name=\"sulfite\" />  In addition to aerobic sulfur oxidation, some organisms (e.g. ''[[Thiobacillus denitrificans]]'') use nitrate ({{chem|NO|3|-}}) as a terminal electron acceptor and therefore grow anaerobically.\n\n===Ferrous iron ({{chem|Fe|2+}}) oxidation===\n{{further information|Acidophiles in acid mine drainage}}\n\n[[Iron(II) oxide|Ferrous iron]] is a soluble form of iron that is stable at extremely low [[pH]]s or under anaerobic conditions.  Under aerobic, moderate pH conditions ferrous iron is oxidized spontaneously to the ferric ({{chem|Fe|3+}}) form and is hydrolyzed abiotically to insoluble [[ferric hydroxide]] ({{chem|Fe(OH)|3}}).  There are three distinct types of ferrous iron-oxidizing microbes.  The first are [[acidophile (organisms)|acidophile]]s, such as the bacteria ''[[Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans]]'' and ''[[Leptospirillum ferrooxidans]]'', as well as the [[archaeon]] ''[[Ferroplasma]]''.  These microbes oxidize iron in environments that have a very low pH and are important in [[acid mine drainage]].  The second type of microbes oxidize ferrous iron at near-neutral pH. These micro-organisms (for example ''[[Gallionella ferruginea]]'', ''[[Leptothrix ochracea]]'', or ''[[Mariprofundus ferrooxydans]]'') live at the oxic-anoxic interfaces and are microaerophiles.  The third type of iron-oxidizing microbes are anaerobic photosynthetic bacteria such as [[Rhodopseudomonas]],<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Jiao Y, Kappler A, Croal LR, Newman DK |title= Isolation and Characterization of a Genetically Tractable Photoautotrophic Fe(II)-Oxidizing Bacterium, Rhodopseudomonas palustris Strain TIE-1 |journal=Appl Environ Microbiol |volume=71 |issue=8 |pages=4487\u201396|date=August 2005 |pmid=16085840 |doi= 10.1128/AEM.71.8.4487-4496.2005 |pmc= 1183355}}</ref> which use ferrous iron to produce NADH for autotrophic carbon dioxide fixation.  Biochemically, aerobic iron oxidation is a very energetically poor process which therefore requires large amounts of iron to be oxidized by the enzyme [[rusticyanin]] to facilitate the formation of proton motive force.  Like sulfur oxidation, reverse electron flow must be used to form the NADH used for carbon dioxide fixation via the Calvin cycle.\n\n===Nitrification===\n\nNitrification is the process by which [[ammonia]] ({{chem|NH|3}}) is converted to nitrate ({{chem|NO|3|-}}).  Nitrification is actually the net result of two distinct processes: oxidation of ammonia to nitrite ({{chem|link=Nitrite|NO|2|-}}) by nitrosifying bacteria (e.g. ''[[Nitrosomonas]]'') and oxidation of nitrite to nitrate by the nitrite-oxidizing bacteria (e.g. ''[[Nitrobacter]]'').  Both of these processes are extremely energetically poor leading to very slow growth rates for both types of organisms.  Biochemically, ammonia oxidation occurs by the stepwise oxidation of ammonia to [[hydroxylamine]] ({{chem|NH|2|OH}}) by the enzyme [[ammonia monooxygenase]] in the [[cytoplasm]], followed by the oxidation of hydroxylamine to nitrite by the enzyme [[hydroxylamine oxidoreductase]] in the [[periplasm]].\n\nElectron and proton cycling are very complex but as a net result only one proton is translocated across the membrane per molecule of ammonia oxidized.  Nitrite oxidation is much simpler, with nitrite being oxidized by the enzyme [[nitrite oxidoreductase]] coupled to proton translocation by a very short electron transport chain, again leading to very low growth rates for these organisms.  Oxygen is required in both ammonia and nitrite oxidation, meaning that both nitrosifying and nitrite-oxidizing bacteria are aerobes.  As in sulfur and iron oxidation, NADH for carbon dioxide fixation using the Calvin cycle is generated by reverse electron flow, thereby placing a further metabolic burden on an already energy-poor process.\n\nIn 2015, two groups independently showed the microbial genus ''[[Nitrospira]]'' is capable of complete nitrification ([[Comammox]]).<ref>{{Cite journal|title = Complete nitrification by a single microorganism|journal = Nature|date = 2015-12-24|issn = 0028-0836|pages = 555\u2013559|volume = 528|issue = 7583|doi = 10.1038/nature16459|first = Maartje A.

Amazingly, [[hydrazine]] ({{chem|N|2|H|4}} \u2013 rocket fuel) is produced as an intermediate during anammox metabolism.  To deal with the high toxicity of hydrazine, anammox bacteria contain a hydrazine-containing intracellular organelle called the anammoxasome, surrounded by highly compact (and unusual) [[ladderane]] lipid membrane.  These lipids are unique in nature, as is the use of hydrazine as a metabolic intermediate.  Anammox organisms are autotrophs although the mechanism for carbon dioxide fixation is unclear.

In addition to these organisms, some microbes (e.g. the Archaeon ''[[Halobacterium]]'' or the bacterium ''[[Roseobacter]]'', among others) can utilize light to produce energy using the enzyme [[bacteriorhodopsin]], a light-driven proton pump.

All photosynthetic organisms locate their [[photosynthetic reaction center]]s within a membrane, which may be invaginations of the [[cytoplasmic membrane]] (Proteobacteria), [[thylakoid membrane]]s (Cyanobacteria), specialized antenna structures called [[chlorosome]]s (Green sulfur and non-sulfur bacteria), or the cytoplasmic membrane itself (heliobacteria).  Different photosynthetic bacteria also contain different photosynthetic pigments, such as [[chlorophyll]]s and [[carotenoids]], allowing them to take advantage of different portions of the [[electromagnetic spectrum]] and thereby inhabit different [[ecological niche|niche]]s.  Some groups of organisms contain more specialized light-harvesting structures (e.g. [[phycobilisome]]s in Cyanobacteria and chlorosomes in Green sulfur and non-sulfur bacteria), allowing for increased efficiency in light utilization.\n\nBiochemically, anoxygenic photosynthesis is very different from oxygenic photosynthesis.  Cyanobacteria (and by extension, chloroplasts) use the [[Z scheme]] of electron flow in which electrons eventually are used to form NADH.  Two different reaction centers (photosystems) are used and proton motive force is generated both by using cyclic electron flow and the quinone pool.  In anoxygenic photosynthetic bacteria, electron flow is cyclic, with all electrons used in photosynthesis eventually being transferred back to the single reaction center.  A proton motive force is generated using only the quinone pool.  In heliobacteria, Green sulfur, and Green non-sulfur bacteria, NADH is formed using the protein [[ferredoxin]], an energetically favorable reaction.  In purple bacteria, NADH is formed by reverse electron flow due to the lower chemical potential of this reaction center.  In all cases, however, a proton motive force is generated and used to drive ATP production via an ATPase.\n\nMost photosynthetic microbes are autotrophic, fixing carbon dioxide via the Calvin cycle.  Some photosynthetic bacteria (e.g. Chloroflexus) are photoheterotrophs, meaning that they use organic carbon compounds as a carbon source for growth.  Some photosynthetic organisms also fix nitrogen (see below).\n\n==Nitrogen fixation==\n{{main|Nitrogen fixation}}\n\nNitrogen is an element required for growth by all biological systems.  While extremely common (80% by volume) in the [[atmosphere]], dinitrogen gas ({{chem|N|2}}) is generally biologically inaccessible due to its high [[activation energy]].  Throughout all of nature, only specialized bacteria and Archaea are capable of nitrogen fixation, converting dinitrogen gas into ammonia ({{chem|NH|3}}), which is easily assimilated by all organisms.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Cabello P, Rold\u00e1n MD, Moreno-Vivi\u00e1n C |title=Nitrate reduction and the nitrogen cycle in archaea |journal=Microbiology |volume=150 |issue=Pt 11 |pages=3527&ndash;46 |date=November 2004 |pmid=15528644 |doi=10.1099/mic.0.27303-0 |url=http://mic.sgmjournals.org/cgi/content/full/150/11/3527?view=long&pmid=15528644}}</ref>  These prokaryotes, therefore, are very important ecologically and are often essential for the survival of entire ecosystems.  This is especially true in the ocean, where nitrogen-fixing cyanobacteria are often the only sources of fixed nitrogen, and in soils, where specialized symbioses exist between [[legume]]s and their nitrogen-fixing partners to provide the nitrogen needed by these plants for growth.\n\nNitrogen fixation can be found distributed throughout nearly all bacterial lineages and physiological classes but is not a universal property.  Because the enzyme [[nitrogenase]], responsible for nitrogen fixation, is very sensitive to oxygen which will inhibit it irreversibly, all nitrogen-fixing organisms must possess some mechanism to keep the concentration of oxygen low.  Examples include:\n* heterocyst formation (cyanobacteria e.g. ''[[Anabaena]]'') where one cell does not photosynthesize but instead fixes nitrogen for its neighbors which in turn provide it with energy\n* root nodule symbioses (e.g. ''[[Rhizobium]]'') with plants that supply oxygen to the bacteria bound to molecules of [[leghaemoglobin]]\n* anaerobic lifestyle (e.g. ''[[Clostridium pasteurianum]]'')\n* very fast metabolism (e.g. ''[[Azotobacter vinelandii]]'')\nThe production and activity of nitrogenases is very highly regulated, both because nitrogen fixation is an extremely energetically expensive process (16\u201324 ATP are used per {{chem|N|2}} fixed) and due to the extreme sensitivity of the nitrogenase to oxygen.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Lipophilic bacteria]], a minority of bacteria with [[lipid metabolism]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*{{cite book | last1=Madigan| first1=Michael T.| last2=Martinko|first2=John M.| title= Brock Biology of Microorganisms| year= 2005| publisher=Pearson Prentice Hall}}\n\n{{modelling ecosystems}}\n\n[[Category:Metabolism]]\n[[Category:Trophic ecology]]\n\n{{portal bar|Metabolism}}\n", "text_old": "'''Microbial metabolism''' is the means by which a [[microbe]] obtains the energy and nutrients (e.g. [[carbon]]) it needs to live and reproduce.  Microbes use many different types of [[metabolism|metabolic]] strategies and species can often be differentiated from each other based on metabolic characteristics.  The specific metabolic properties of a microbe are the major factors in determining that microbe's [[ecological niche]], and often allow for that microbe to be useful in [[biotechnology|industrial processes]] or responsible for [[biogeochemistry|biogeochemical]] cycles.\n\n==Types==\n[[File:Troph flowchart.svg|thumb|350px|right|Flow chart to determine the metabolic characteristics of microorganisms]]\n{{main|Primary nutritional groups}} \n\nAll microbial metabolisms can be arranged according to three principles:\n\n1. How the organism obtains carbon for synthesising cell mass:\n* '''[[autotroph]]ic''' \u2013 carbon is obtained from [[carbon dioxide]] ({{CO2}})\n* '''[[heterotroph]]ic''' \u2013 carbon is obtained from [[organic compound]]s\n* '''[[mixotroph]]ic''' \u2013 carbon is obtained from both organic compounds and by fixing carbon dioxide\n2. How the organism obtains [[reducing equivalent]]s used either in energy conservation or in biosynthetic reactions:\n* '''[[lithotroph]]ic''' \u2013 reducing equivalents are obtained from [[inorganic compound]]s\n* '''[[organotroph]]ic''' \u2013 reducing equivalents are obtained from organic compounds\n3. How the organism obtains energy for living and growing:\n* '''[[chemotroph]]ic''' \u2013 energy is obtained from external [[chemical compound]]s\n* '''[[phototroph]]ic''' \u2013 energy is obtained from light\n\nIn practice, these terms are almost freely combined. Typical examples are as follows:\n\n* '''chemolithoautotrophs''' obtain energy from the oxidation of inorganic compounds and carbon from the fixation of carbon dioxide. Examples: [[Nitrifying bacteria]], Sulfur-oxidizing bacteria, [[Iron-oxidizing bacteria]], [[Knallgas-bacteria]]\n* '''photolithoautotrophs''' obtain energy from light and carbon from the fixation of carbon dioxide, using reducing equivalents from inorganic compounds. Examples: [[Cyanobacteria]] (water ({{chem|H|2|O}}) as reducing equivalent donor), [[Chlorobiaceae]], [[Chromatiaceae]] (hydrogen sulfide ({{chem|link=Hydrogen sulfide|H|2|S}}) as reducing equivalent donor), ''[[Chloroflexus]]'' (hydrogen ({{chem|H|2}}) as reducing equivalent donor)\n* '''chemolithoheterotrophs''' obtain energy from the oxidation of inorganic compounds, but cannot fix carbon dioxide ({{CO2}}). Examples: some ''[[Hydrogenophilaceae|Thiobacilus]]'', some ''[[Beggiatoa]]'', some ''[[Nitrobacter]]'' spp., ''[[Wolinella]]'' (with {{chem|H|2}} as reducing equivalent donor), some [[Knallgas-bacteria]], some [[sulfate-reducing bacteria]]\n* '''chemoorganoheterotrophs''' obtain energy, carbon, and reducing equivalents for biosynthetic reactions from organic compounds. Examples: most bacteria, e. g. ''[[Escherichia coli]]'', ''[[Bacillus]]'' spp., ''[[Actinobacteria]]''\n* '''photoorganoheterotrophs''' obtain energy from light, carbon and reducing equivalents for biosynthetic reactions from organic compounds. Some species are strictly heterotrophic, many others can also fix carbon dioxide and are mixotrophic. Examples: ''[[Rhodobacter]]'', ''[[Rhodopseudomonas]]'', ''[[Rhodospirillum]]'', ''[[Rhodomicrobium]]'', ''[[Rhodocyclus]]'', ''[[Heliobacteria|Heliobacterium]]'', ''[[Chloroflexus]]'' (alternatively to photolithoautotrophy with hydrogen)\n\n==Heterotrophic microbial metabolism==\n\nSome microbes are heterotrophic (more precisely chemoorganoheterotrophic), using organic compounds as both carbon and energy sources. Heterotrophic microbes live off of nutrients that they scavenge from living hosts (as [[commensals]] or [[parasite]]s) or find in dead organic matter of all kind ([[saprophage]]s). Microbial metabolism is the main contribution for the bodily decay of all organisms after death. Many [[eukaryotic]] microorganisms are heterotrophic by [[predation]] or [[parasitism]], properties also found in some bacteria such as ''[[Bdellovibrio]]'' (an intracellular parasite of other bacteria, causing death of its victims) and Myxobacteria such as ''[[Myxococcus]]'' (predators of other bacteria which are killed and lysed by cooperating swarms of many single cells of Myxobacteria). Most [[pathogen]]ic bacteria can be viewed as heterotrophic parasites of humans or the other eukaryotic species they affect. Heterotrophic microbes are extremely abundant in nature and are responsible for the breakdown of large organic [[polymer]]s such as [[cellulose]], [[chitin]] or [[lignin]] which are generally indigestible to larger animals. Generally, the breakdown of large polymers to carbon dioxide ([[Mineralization (biology)|mineralization]]) requires several different organisms, with one breaking down the polymer into its constituent monomers, one able to use the monomers and excreting simpler waste compounds as by-products, and one able to use the excreted wastes.  There are many variations on this theme, as different organisms are able to degrade different polymers and secrete different waste products.  Some organisms are even able to degrade more recalcitrant compounds such as petroleum compounds or pesticides, making them useful in [[bioremediation]].\n\nBiochemically, [[prokaryotic]] heterotrophic metabolism is much more versatile than that of [[eukaryotic]] organisms, although many prokaryotes share the most basic metabolic models with eukaryotes, e. g. using [[glycolysis]] (also called [[Embden-Meyerhoff-Parnas|EMP pathway]]) for sugar metabolism and the [[citric acid cycle]] to degrade [[acetate]], producing energy in the form of [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]] and reducing power in the form of [[NADH]] or [[quinols]].  These basic pathways are well conserved because they are also involved in biosynthesis of many conserved building blocks needed for cell growth (sometimes in reverse direction).  However, many [[bacteria]] and [[archaea]] utilize alternative metabolic pathways other than glycolysis and the citric acid cycle.  A well-studied example is sugar metabolism via the [[KDPG pathway|keto-deoxy-phosphogluconate pathway]] (also called [[Entner\u2013Doudoroff pathway|ED pathway]]) in ''[[Pseudomonas]]''.  Moreover, there is a third alternative sugar-catabolic pathway used by some bacteria, the [[pentose phosphate pathway]]. The metabolic diversity and ability of prokaryotes to use a large variety of organic compounds arises from the much deeper evolutionary history and diversity of prokaryotes, as compared to eukaryotes.  It is also noteworthy that the [[mitochondrion]], the small membrane-bound intracellular organelle that is the site of eukaryotic energy metabolism, arose from the [[endosymbiosis]] of a [[bacterium]] related to obligate intracellular ''[[Rickettsia]]'', and also to plant-associated ''[[Rhizobium]]'' or ''[[Agrobacterium]]''.  Therefore, it is not surprising that all mitrochondriate eukaryotes share metabolic properties with these [[Proteobacteria]].  Most microbes [[Cellular respiration|respire]] (use an [[electron transport chain]]), although [[oxygen]] is not the only [[terminal electron acceptor]] that may be used.  As discussed below, the use of terminal electron acceptors other than oxygen has important biogeochemical consequences.\n\n==Fermentation==\n{{main|Fermentation (biochemistry)}}\n\nFermentation is a specific type of heterotrophic metabolism that uses [[organic compound|organic carbon]] instead of oxygen as a terminal electron acceptor.  This means that these organisms do not use an electron transport chain to oxidize NADH to {{chem|NAD|+}} and therefore must have an alternative method of using this reducing power and maintaining a supply of {{chem|NAD|+}} for the proper functioning of normal metabolic pathways (e.g. glycolysis).  As oxygen is not required, fermentative organisms are [[Anaerobic organism|anaerobic]].  Many organisms can use fermentation under anaerobic conditions and [[aerobic respiration]] when oxygen is present.  These organisms are [[facultative anaerobe]]s.  To avoid the overproduction of NADH, [[Obligate anaerobe|obligately]] fermentative organisms usually do not have a complete citric acid cycle.  Instead of using an [[ATP synthase]] as in [[Cellular respiration|respiration]], ATP in fermentative organisms is produced by [[substrate-level phosphorylation]] where a [[phosphate]] group is transferred from a high-energy organic compound to [[Adenosine diphosphate|ADP]] to form ATP.  As a result of the need to produce high energy phosphate-containing organic compounds (generally in the form of [[Coenzyme A]]-esters) fermentative organisms use NADH and other [[cofactor (biochemistry)|cofactor]]s to produce many different reduced metabolic by-products, often including [[hydrogen]] gas ({{chem|H|2}}). These reduced organic compounds are generally small [[organic acid]]s and [[alcohol]]s derived from [[pyruvic acid|pyruvate]], the end product of [[glycolysis]]. Examples include [[ethanol]], [[acetic acid|acetate]], [[lactic acid|lactate]], and [[butyric acid|butyrate]]. Fermentative organisms are very important industrially and are used to make many different types of food products. The different metabolic end products produced by each specific bacterial species are responsible for the different tastes and properties of each food.\n\nNot all fermentative organisms use substrate-level [[phosphorylation]]. Instead, some organisms are able to couple the oxidation of low-energy organic compounds directly to the formation of a [[proton motive force|proton (or sodium) motive force]] and therefore [[ATP synthesis]].  Examples of these unusual forms of fermentation include [[succinate]] fermentation by ''[[Propionigenium modestum]]'' and [[oxalate]] fermentation by ''[[Oxalobacter formigenes]]''. These reactions are extremely low-energy yielding.  Humans and other higher animals also use fermentation to produce [[Lactic acid|lactate]] from excess NADH, although this is not the major form of metabolism as it is in fermentative microorganisms.\n\n==Special metabolic properties==\n\n===Methylotrophy===\n\nMethylotrophy refers to the ability of an organism to use [[C1-compounds]] as energy sources. These compounds include [[methanol]], [[methyl amine]]s, [[formaldehyde]], and [[formic acid|formate]].  Several other less common substrates may also be used for metabolism, all of which lack carbon-carbon bonds. Examples of methylotrophs include the bacteria ''[[Methylomonas]]'' and ''[[Methylobacter]]''. [[Methanotroph]]s are a specific type of methylotroph that are also able to use [[methane]] ({{chem|CH|4}}) as a carbon source by oxidizing it sequentially to methanol ({{chem|CH|3|OH}}), formaldehyde ({{chem|CH|2|O}}), formate ({{chem|HCOO|-}}), and carbon dioxide {{CO2}} initially using the enzyme [[methane monooxygenase]].  As oxygen is required for this process, all (conventional) methanotrophs are [[obligate aerobe]]s.  Reducing power in the form of [[quinone]]s and NADH is produced during these oxidations to produce a proton motive force and therefore ATP generation.  Methylotrophs and methanotrophs are not considered as autotrophic, because they are able to incorporate some of the oxidized methane (or other metabolites) into cellular carbon before it is completely oxidized to {{CO2}} (at the level of formaldehyde), using either the [[serine pathway]] (''[[Methylosinus]]'', ''[[Methylocystis]]'') or the [[ribulose monophosphate pathway]] (''[[Methylococcus]]''), depending on the species of methylotroph.\n\nIn addition to aerobic methylotrophy, methane can also be oxidized anaerobically. This occurs by a consortium of sulfate-reducing bacteria and relatives of [[methanogen]]ic [[Archaea]] working syntrophically (see below). Little is currently known about the biochemistry and ecology of this process.\n\n[[Methanogenesis]] is the biological production of methane.  It is carried out by methanogens, strictly [[Anaerobic organism|anaerobic]] Archaea such as ''[[Methanococcus]]'', ''[[Methanocaldococcus]]'', ''[[Methanobacterium]]'',\n''[[Methanothermus]]'', ''[[Methanosarcina]]'', ''[[Methanosaeta]]'' and ''[[Methanopyrus]]''.  The biochemistry of methanogenesis is unique in nature in its use of a number of unusual [[cofactor (biochemistry)|cofactor]]s to sequentially reduce methanogenic substrates to methane, such as [[coenzyme M]] and [[methanofuran]].<ref>{{cite journal  |vauthors=DiMarco AA, Bobik TA, Wolfe RS |title=Unusual coenzymes of methanogenesis |journal=Annu. Rev. Biochem. |volume=59 |pages=355&ndash;94 |year=1990 |pmid=2115763 |doi=10.1146/annurev.bi.59.070190.002035}}</ref>  These cofactors are responsible (among other things) for the establishment of a [[proton]] gradient across the outer membrane thereby driving ATP synthesis.  Several types of methanogenesis occur, differing in the starting compounds oxidized.  Some methanogens reduce carbon dioxide ({{CO2}}) to methane ({{chem|CH|4}}) using electrons (most often) from hydrogen gas ({{chem|H|2}})  chemolithoautotrophically.  These methanogens can often be found in environments containing fermentative organisms.  The tight association of methanogens and fermentative bacteria can be considered to be syntrophic (see below) because the methanogens, which rely on the fermentors for hydrogen, relieve feedback inhibition of the fermentors by the build-up of excess hydrogen that would otherwise inhibit their growth.  This type of syntrophic relationship is specifically known as [[interspecies hydrogen transfer]].  A second group of methanogens use methanol ({{chem|CH|3|OH}}) as a substrate for methanogenesis. These are chemoorganotrophic, but still autotrophic in using {{CO2}} as only carbon source.  The biochemistry of this process is quite different from that of the carbon dioxide-reducing methanogens.  Lastly, a third group of methanogens produce both methane and carbon dioxide from [[acetate]] ({{chem|CH|3|COO|-}}) with the acetate being split between the two carbons. These acetate-cleaving organisms are the only chemoorganoheterotrophic methanogens.  All autotrophic methanogens use a variation of the [[reductive acetyl-CoA pathway]] to fix {{CO2}} and obtain cellular carbon.\n\n===Syntrophy===\n\nSyntrophy, in the context of microbial metabolism, refers to the pairing of multiple species to achieve a [[chemical reaction]] that, on its own, would be energetically unfavorable.  The best studied example of this process is the oxidation of fermentative end products (such as acetate, [[ethanol]] and [[butyrate]]) by organisms such as ''[[Syntrophomonas]]''.  Alone, the oxidation of butyrate to acetate and hydrogen gas is energetically unfavorable.  However, when a [[hydrogenotrophic]] (hydrogen-using) methanogen is present the use of the hydrogen gas will significantly lower the concentration of hydrogen (down to 10<sup>\u22125</sup> atm) and thereby shift the [[Chemical equilibrium|equilibrium]] of the butyrate oxidation reaction under standard conditions (\u0394G\u00ba\u2019) to non-standard conditions (\u0394G\u2019). Because the concentration of one product is lowered, the reaction is \"pulled\" towards the products and shifted towards net energetically favorable conditions (for butyrate oxidation: \u0394G\u00ba\u2019= +48.2 kJ/mol, but \u0394G' = -8.9 kJ/mol at 10<sup>\u22125</sup> atm hydrogen and even lower if also the initially produced acetate is further metabolized by methanogens). Conversely, the available free energy from methanogenesis is lowered from \u0394G\u00ba\u2019= -131 kJ/mol under standard conditions to \u0394G' = -17 kJ/mol at 10<sup>\u22125</sup> atm hydrogen. This is an example of intraspecies hydrogen transfer.  In this way, low energy-yielding carbon sources can be used by a consortium of organisms to achieve further degradation and eventual [[mineralization (biology)|mineralization]] of these compounds.  These reactions help prevent the excess sequestration of carbon over geologic time scales, releasing it back to the biosphere in usable forms such as methane and {{CO2}}.\n\n==Anaerobic respiration==\n\nWhile [[aerobic organism]]s during respiration use oxygen as a [[terminal electron acceptor]], [[anaerobic organism]]s use other electron acceptors. These inorganic compounds have a lower reduction potential than oxygen, meaning that [[Cellular respiration|respiration]] is less efficient in these organisms and leads to slower growth rates than aerobes. Many [[facultative anaerobe]]s can use either oxygen or alternative terminal electron acceptors for respiration depending on the environmental conditions.\n\nMost respiring anaerobes are heterotrophs, although some do live autotrophically. All of the processes described below are dissimilative, meaning that they are used during energy production and not to provide nutrients for the cell (assimilative). Assimilative pathways for many forms of [[anaerobic respiration]] are also known.\n\n===Denitrification \u2013 nitrate as electron acceptor===\n{{main|Denitrification}}\n\nDenitrification is the utilization of [[nitrate]] ({{chem|NO|3|-}}) as a terminal electron acceptor.  It is a widespread process that is used by many members of the Proteobacteria.  Many facultative anaerobes use denitrification because nitrate, like oxygen, has a high reduction potential.  Many denitrifying bacteria can also use ferric [[iron]] ({{chem|Fe|3+}}) and some organic [[electron acceptor]]s.  Denitrification involves the stepwise reduction of nitrate to [[nitrite]] ({{chem|NO|2|-}}), [[nitric oxide]] (NO), [[nitrous oxide]] ({{chem|N|2|O}}), and dinitrogen ({{chem|N|2}}) by the enzymes [[nitrate reductase]], [[nitrite reductase]], nitric oxide reductase, and nitrous oxide reductase, respectively.  Protons are transported across the membrane by the initial NADH reductase, quinones, and nitrous oxide reductase to produce the electrochemical gradient critical for respiration.  Some organisms (e.g. ''[[E. coli]]'') only produce nitrate reductase and therefore can accomplish only the first reduction leading to the accumulation of nitrite.  Others (e.g. ''[[Paracoccus denitrificans]]'' or ''[[Pseudomonas stutzeri]]'') reduce nitrate completely.  Complete denitrification is an environmentally significant process because some intermediates of denitrification (nitric oxide and nitrous oxide) are important [[greenhouse gas]]es that react with [[sunlight]] and [[ozone]] to produce nitric acid, a component of [[acid rain]].  Denitrification is also important in biological [[wastewater]] treatment where it is used to reduce the amount of nitrogen released into the environment thereby reducing [[eutrophication]]. Denitrification can be determined via a [[nitrate reductase test]].\n\n===Sulfate reduction \u2013 sulfate as electron acceptor===\n{{main|Sulfate-reducing bacteria}}\n\n[[Dissimilatory sulfate reduction]] is a relatively energetically poor process used by many Gram-negative bacteria found within the [[deltaproteobacteria]], Gram-positive organisms relating to ''[[Desulfotomaculum]]'' or the archaeon ''[[Archaeoglobus]]''. [[Hydrogen sulfide]] ({{chem|H|2|S}}) is produced as a metabolic end product. For sulfate reduction electron donors and energy are needed.\n\n====Electron donors====\n\nMany sulfate reducers are organotrophic, using carbon compounds such as lactate and pyruvate (among many others) as [[electron donor]]s,<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Ishimoto M, Koyama J, Nagai Y |title=Biochemical Studies on Sulfate-Reducing Bacteria: IV.

Because sulfate is energetically stable, before it can be metabolized it must first be activated by adenylation to form APS (adenosine 5\u2019-phosphosulfate) thereby consuming ATP.  The APS is then reduced by the enzyme APS reductase to form [[sulfite]] ({{chem|SO|3|2\u2212}}) and [[Adenosine monophosphate|AMP]].  In organisms that use carbon compounds as electron donors, the ATP consumed is accounted for by fermentation of the carbon substrate.  The hydrogen produced during fermentation is actually what drives respiration during sulfate reduction.\n\n===Acetogenesis \u2013 carbon dioxide as electron acceptor===\n{{main|Acetogenesis}}\n\nAcetogenesis is a type of microbial metabolism that uses hydrogen ({{chem|H|2}}) as an electron donor and carbon dioxide ({{CO2}}) as an electron acceptor to produce acetate, the same electron donors and acceptors used in methanogenesis (see above).  Bacteria that can autotrophically synthesize acetate are called homoacetogens.  Carbon dioxide [[Redox|reduction]] in all homoacetogens occurs by the acetyl-CoA pathway.  This pathway is also used for carbon fixation by autotrophic sulfate-reducing bacteria and hydrogenotrophic methanogens.  Often homoacetogens can also be fermentative, using the hydrogen and carbon dioxide produced as a result of fermentation to produce acetate, which is secreted as an end product.\n\n===Other inorganic electron acceptors===\n\nFerric iron ({{chem|Fe|3+}}) is a widespread anaerobic terminal electron acceptor both for autotrophic and heterotrophic organisms.  Electron flow in these organisms is similar to those in [[electron transport]], ending in oxygen or nitrate, except that in ferric iron-reducing organisms the final enzyme in this system is a ferric iron reductase.  Model organisms include ''[[Shewanella putrefaciens]]'' and ''[[Geobacter|Geobacter metallireducens]]''.  Since some ferric iron-reducing bacteria (e.g. ''G. metallireducens'') can use toxic [[hydrocarbon]]s such as [[toluene]] as a carbon source, there is significant interest in using these organisms as bioremediation agents in ferric iron-rich contaminated [[aquifer]]s.\n\nAlthough ferric iron is the most prevalent inorganic electron acceptor, a number of organisms (including the iron-reducing bacteria mentioned above) can use other [[inorganic]] ions in anaerobic respiration.  While these processes may often be less significant ecologically, they are of considerable interest for bioremediation, especially when [[heavy metals]] or [[radionuclide]]s are used as electron acceptors.  Examples include:\n* [[Manganese|Manganic ion]] ({{chem|Mn|4+}}) reduction to [[manganous ion]] ({{chem|Mn|2+}})\n* [[Selenium|Selenate]] ({{chem|SeO|4|2-}}) reduction to [[Selenium|selenite]] ({{chem|SeO|3|2-}}) and selenite reduction to inorganic [[selenium]] (Se<sup>0</sup>)\n* [[Arsenic|Arsenate]] ({{chem|AsO|4|3-}}) reduction to [[arsenic|arsenite]] ({{chem|AsO|3|3-}})\n* [[Uranyl|Uranyl ion]] ion ({{chem|UO|2|2+}}) reduction to [[uranium dioxide]] ({{chem|UO|2}})\n\n===Organic terminal electron acceptors===\n\nA number of organisms, instead of using inorganic compounds as terminal electron acceptors, are able to use organic compounds to accept electrons from respiration.  Examples include:\n* [[Fumarate]] reduction to [[succinate]]\n* [[Trimethylamine N-oxide|Trimethylamine ''N''-oxide]] (TMAO) reduction to [[trimethylamine]] (TMA)\n* [[Dimethyl sulfoxide]] (DMSO) reduction to [[Dimethyl sulfide]] (DMS)\n* Reductive dechlorination\nTMAO is a chemical commonly produced by [[fish]], and when reduced to TMA produces a strong odor.  DMSO is a common marine and freshwater chemical which is also odiferous when reduced to DMS.  Reductive dechlorination is the process by which chlorinated organic compounds are reduced to form their non-chlorinated endproducts.  As chlorinated organic compounds are often important (and difficult to degrade) environmental pollutants, reductive dechlorination is an important process in bioremediation.\n\n==Chemolithotrophy==\n\n[[Chemolithotrophy]] is a type of metabolism where energy is obtained from the oxidation of inorganic compounds.  Most chemolithotrophic organisms are also autotrophic.  There are two major objectives to chemolithotrophy: the generation of energy (ATP) and the generation of reducing power (NADH).\n\n===Hydrogen oxidation===\n{{main|Hydrogen oxidizing bacteria}}\nMany organisms are capable of using hydrogen ({{chem|H|2}}) as a source of energy.  While several mechanisms of anaerobic hydrogen [[oxidation]] have been mentioned previously (e.g. sulfate reducing- and acetogenic bacteria), hydrogen can also be used as an energy source aerobically in the knallgas reaction:<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/oi/authority.20110803100040856| title=knallgas reaction| publisher=Oxford Reference |access-date=August 19, 2017}}</ref>\n\n:2 H<sub>2</sub> + O<sub>2</sub> \u2192 2 H<sub>2</sub>O + energy\n\nIn these organisms, hydrogen is oxidized by a membrane-bound [[hydrogenase]] causing proton pumping via electron transfer to various quinones and [[cytochrome]]s.  In many organisms, a second cytoplasmic hydrogenase is used to generate reducing power in the form of NADH, which is subsequently used to fix carbon dioxide via the [[Calvin cycle]].  Hydrogen-oxidizing organisms, such as ''Cupriavidus necator'' (formerly ''[[Ralstonia eutropha]]''), often inhabit oxic-anoxic interfaces in nature to take advantage of the hydrogen produced by anaerobic fermentative organisms while still maintaining a supply of oxygen.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Jugder|first=Bat-Erdene|last2=Welch|first2=Jeffrey|last3=Aguey-Zinsou|first3=Kondo-Francois|last4=Marquis|first4=Christopher P.|date=2013|title=Fundamentals and electrochemical applications of [Ni\u2013Fe]-uptake hydrogenases|journal=RSC Advances|volume=3|issue=22|pages=8142|doi=10.1039/c3ra22668a|issn=2046-2069}}</ref>\n\n===Sulfur oxidation===\n\nSulfur oxidation involves the oxidation of reduced sulfur compounds (such as sulfide {{chem|H|2|S}}), inorganic sulfur (S), and thiosulfate ({{chem|S|2|O|3|2-}}) to form [[sulfuric acid]] ({{chem|H|2|SO|4}}).  A classic example of a sulfur-oxidizing bacterium is ''[[Beggiatoa]]'', a microbe originally described by [[Sergei Winogradsky]], one of the founders of [[environmental microbiology]]. Another example is ''[[Paracoccus]]''. Generally, the oxidation of sulfide occurs in stages, with inorganic sulfur being stored either inside or outside of the cell until needed.  This two step process occurs because energetically sulfide is a better electron donor than inorganic sulfur or thiosulfate, allowing for a greater number of protons to be translocated across the membrane.  Sulfur-oxidizing organisms generate reducing power for carbon dioxide fixation via the Calvin cycle using [[reverse electron flow]], an energy-requiring process that pushes the electrons against their [[thermodynamic]] gradient to produce NADH.  Biochemically, reduced sulfur compounds are converted to sulfite ({{chem|SO|3|2\u2212}}) and subsequently converted to sulfate ({{chem|SO|4|2\u2212}}) by the enzyme [[sulfite oxidase]].<ref name=\"sulfite\">{{cite journal |vauthors=Kappler U, Bennett B, Rethmeier J, Schwarz G, Deutzmann R, McEwan AG, Dahl C |title= Sulfite:Cytochrome ''c'' Oxidoreductase from ''Thiobacillus novellus''.

In all cases the energy liberated is transferred to the electron transport chain for ATP and NADH production.<ref name=\"sulfite\" />  In addition to aerobic sulfur oxidation, some organisms (e.g. ''[[Thiobacillus denitrificans]]'') use nitrate ({{chem|NO|3|-}}) as a terminal electron acceptor and therefore grow anaerobically.\n\n===Ferrous iron ({{chem|Fe|2+}}) oxidation===\n{{further information|Acidophiles in acid mine drainage}}\n\n[[Iron(II) oxide|Ferrous iron]] is a soluble form of iron that is stable at extremely low [[pH]]s or under anaerobic conditions.  Under aerobic, moderate pH conditions ferrous iron is oxidized spontaneously to the ferric ({{chem|Fe|3+}}) form and is hydrolyzed abiotically to insoluble [[ferric hydroxide]] ({{chem|Fe(OH)|3}}).  There are three distinct types of ferrous iron-oxidizing microbes.  The first are [[acidophile (organisms)|acidophile]]s, such as the bacteria ''[[Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans]]'' and ''[[Leptospirillum ferrooxidans]]'', as well as the [[archaeon]] ''[[Ferroplasma]]''.  These microbes oxidize iron in environments that have a very low pH and are important in [[acid mine drainage]].  The second type of microbes oxidize ferrous iron at near-neutral pH. These micro-organisms (for example ''[[Gallionella ferruginea]]'', ''[[Leptothrix ochracea]]'', or ''[[Mariprofundus ferrooxydans]]'') live at the oxic-anoxic interfaces and are microaerophiles.  The third type of iron-oxidizing microbes are anaerobic photosynthetic bacteria such as [[Rhodopseudomonas]],<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Jiao Y, Kappler A, Croal LR, Newman DK |title= Isolation and Characterization of a Genetically Tractable Photoautotrophic Fe(II)-Oxidizing Bacterium, Rhodopseudomonas palustris Strain TIE-1 |journal=Appl Environ Microbiol |volume=71 |issue=8 |pages=4487\u201396|date=August 2005 |pmid=16085840 |doi= 10.1128/AEM.71.8.4487-4496.2005 |pmc= 1183355}}</ref> which use ferrous iron to produce NADH for autotrophic carbon dioxide fixation.  Biochemically, aerobic iron oxidation is a very energetically poor process which therefore requires large amounts of iron to be oxidized by the enzyme [[rusticyanin]] to facilitate the formation of proton motive force.  Like sulfur oxidation, reverse electron flow must be used to form the NADH used for carbon dioxide fixation via the Calvin cycle.\n\n===Nitrification===\n\nNitrification is the process by which [[ammonia]] ({{chem|NH|3}}) is converted to nitrate ({{chem|NO|3|-}}).  Nitrification is actually the net result of two distinct processes: oxidation of ammonia to nitrite ({{chem|link=Nitrite|NO|2|-}}) by nitrosifying bacteria (e.g. ''[[Nitrosomonas]]'') and oxidation of nitrite to nitrate by the nitrite-oxidizing bacteria (e.g. ''[[Nitrobacter]]'').  Both of these processes are extremely energetically poor leading to very slow growth rates for both types of organisms.  Biochemically, ammonia oxidation occurs by the stepwise oxidation of ammonia to [[hydroxylamine]] ({{chem|NH|2|OH}}) by the enzyme [[ammonia monooxygenase]] in the [[cytoplasm]], followed by the oxidation of hydroxylamine to nitrite by the enzyme [[hydroxylamine oxidoreductase]] in the [[periplasm]].\n\nElectron and proton cycling are very complex but as a net result only one proton is translocated across the membrane per molecule of ammonia oxidized.  Nitrite oxidation is much simpler, with nitrite being oxidized by the enzyme [[nitrite oxidoreductase]] coupled to proton translocation by a very short electron transport chain, again leading to very low growth rates for these organisms.  Oxygen is required in both ammonia and nitrite oxidation, meaning that both nitrosifying and nitrite-oxidizing bacteria are aerobes.  As in sulfur and iron oxidation, NADH for carbon dioxide fixation using the Calvin cycle is generated by reverse electron flow, thereby placing a further metabolic burden on an already energy-poor process.\n\nIn 2015, two groups independently showed the microbial genus ''[[Nitrospira]]'' is capable of complete nitrification ([[Comammox]]).<ref>{{Cite journal|title = Complete nitrification by a single microorganism|journal = Nature|date = 2015-12-24|issn = 0028-0836|pages = 555\u2013559|volume = 528|issue = 7583|doi = 10.1038/nature16459|first = Maartje A.

Phylogenetically, all oxygenic photosynthetic bacteria are Cyanobacteria, while anoxygenic photosynthetic bacteria belong to the purple bacteria (Proteobacteria), [[Green sulfur bacteria]] (e.g. [[Chlorobium]]), [[Green non-sulfur bacteria]] (e.g. [[Chloroflexus]]), or the [[heliobacteria]] (Low %G+C Gram positives).  In addition to these organisms, some microbes (e.g. the Archaeon ''[[Halobacterium]]'' or the bacterium ''[[Roseobacter]]'', among others) can utilize light to produce energy using the enzyme [[bacteriorhodopsin]], a light-driven proton pump. However, there are no known Archaea that carry out photosynthesis.<ref name=Bryant>{{cite journal |vauthors=Bryant DA, Frigaard NU |title=Prokaryotic photosynthesis and phototrophy illuminated |journal=Trends Microbiol |volume=14 |issue=11 |pages=488&ndash;96 |date=November 2006 |pmid=16997562 |doi=10.1016/j.tim.2006.09.001}}</ref>\n\nAs befits the large diversity of photosynthetic bacteria, there are many different mechanisms by which light is converted into energy for metabolism.  All photosynthetic organisms locate their [[photosynthetic reaction center]]s within a membrane, which may be invaginations of the [[cytoplasmic membrane]] (Proteobacteria), [[thylakoid membrane]]s (Cyanobacteria), specialized antenna structures called [[chlorosome]]s (Green sulfur and non-sulfur bacteria), or the cytoplasmic membrane itself (heliobacteria).  Different photosynthetic bacteria also contain different photosynthetic pigments, such as [[chlorophyll]]s and [[carotenoids]], allowing them to take advantage of different portions of the [[electromagnetic spectrum]] and thereby inhabit different [[ecological niche|niche]]s.  Some groups of organisms contain more specialized light-harvesting structures (e.g. [[phycobilisome]]s in Cyanobacteria and chlorosomes in Green sulfur and non-sulfur bacteria), allowing for increased efficiency in light utilization.\n\nBiochemically, anoxygenic photosynthesis is very different from oxygenic photosynthesis.  Cyanobacteria (and by extension, chloroplasts) use the [[Z scheme]] of electron flow in which electrons eventually are used to form NADH.  Two different reaction centers (photosystems) are used and proton motive force is generated both by using cyclic electron flow and the quinone pool.  In anoxygenic photosynthetic bacteria, electron flow is cyclic, with all electrons used in photosynthesis eventually being transferred back to the single reaction center.  A proton motive force is generated using only the quinone pool.  In heliobacteria, Green sulfur, and Green non-sulfur bacteria, NADH is formed using the protein [[ferredoxin]], an energetically favorable reaction.  In purple bacteria, NADH is formed by reverse electron flow due to the lower chemical potential of this reaction center.  In all cases, however, a proton motive force is generated and used to drive ATP production via an ATPase.\n\nMost photosynthetic microbes are autotrophic, fixing carbon dioxide via the Calvin cycle.  Some photosynthetic bacteria (e.g. Chloroflexus) are photoheterotrophs, meaning that they use organic carbon compounds as a carbon source for growth.  Some photosynthetic organisms also fix nitrogen (see below).\n\n==Nitrogen fixation==\n{{main|Nitrogen fixation}}\n\nNitrogen is an element required for growth by all biological systems.  While extremely common (80% by volume) in the [[atmosphere]], dinitrogen gas ({{chem|N|2}}) is generally biologically inaccessible due to its high [[activation energy]].  Throughout all of nature, only specialized bacteria and Archaea are capable of nitrogen fixation, converting dinitrogen gas into ammonia ({{chem|NH|3}}), which is easily assimilated by all organisms.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Cabello P, Rold\u00e1n MD, Moreno-Vivi\u00e1n C |title=Nitrate reduction and the nitrogen cycle in archaea |journal=Microbiology |volume=150 |issue=Pt 11 |pages=3527&ndash;46 |date=November 2004 |pmid=15528644 |doi=10.1099/mic.0.27303-0 |url=http://mic.sgmjournals.org/cgi/content/full/150/11/3527?view=long&pmid=15528644}}</ref>  These prokaryotes, therefore, are very important ecologically and are often essential for the survival of entire ecosystems.  This is especially true in the ocean, where nitrogen-fixing cyanobacteria are often the only sources of fixed nitrogen, and in soils, where specialized symbioses exist between [[legume]]s and their nitrogen-fixing partners to provide the nitrogen needed by these plants for growth.\n\nNitrogen fixation can be found distributed throughout nearly all bacterial lineages and physiological classes but is not a universal property.  Because the enzyme [[nitrogenase]], responsible for nitrogen fixation, is very sensitive to oxygen which will inhibit it irreversibly, all nitrogen-fixing organisms must possess some mechanism to keep the concentration of oxygen low.  Examples include:\n* heterocyst formation (cyanobacteria e.g. ''[[Anabaena]]'') where one cell does not photosynthesize but instead fixes nitrogen for its neighbors which in turn provide it with energy\n* root nodule symbioses (e.g. ''[[Rhizobium]]'') with plants that supply oxygen to the bacteria bound to molecules of [[leghaemoglobin]]\n* anaerobic lifestyle (e.g. ''[[Clostridium pasteurianum]]'')\n* very fast metabolism (e.g. ''[[Azotobacter vinelandii]]'')\nThe production and activity of nitrogenases is very highly regulated, both because nitrogen fixation is an extremely energetically expensive process (16\u201324 ATP are used per {{chem|N|2}} fixed) and due to the extreme sensitivity of the nitrogenase to oxygen.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Lipophilic bacteria]], a minority of bacteria with [[lipid metabolism]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*{{cite book | last1=Madigan| first1=Michael T.| last2=Martinko|first2=John M.| title= Brock Biology of Microorganisms| year= 2005| publisher=Pearson Prentice Hall}}\n\n{{modelling ecosystems}}\n\n[[Category:Metabolism]]\n[[Category:Trophic ecology]]\n\n{{portal bar|Metabolism}}\n", "name_user": "2402:3a80:16eb:387a:0:c:a1d1:9001", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microbial_metabolism"}
