This article deals with both princesses of the blood royal and women who become princesses upon marriage.\n\nThe use of the title of [[Princess|Princess of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland]] is entirely at the will of the [[Monarch|sovereign]] as expressed in [[letters patent]]. Individuals holding the title of princess are styled \"[[Royal Highness|Her Royal Highness]]\" (HRH). On 18 April 1917, the newest granddaughter of [[Wilhelm II, German Emperor]] was styled a British Princess from birth even though Germany and Britain were fighting in WWI. [[George V]] wrote Letters Patent on 30 November 1917,<ref name=\"LettersPatentNov1917\">{{cite web|url=http://www.heraldica.org/topics/britain/prince_highness_docs.htm#1917_2|last=Velde|first=Fran\u00e7ois|title=Royal Styles and Titles \u2013 1917 Letters Patent|date=9 April 2012|website=Heraldica|accessdate=6 February 2017}}</ref> to restrict the automatic assignment of the title \"Princess\" and the use of the style \"Royal Highness\" to the following persons:\n\n* the legitimate daughters of a British sovereign,\n* the legitimate male line granddaughters of a British sovereign,\n* the wife of a [[British prince]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.heraldica.org/topics/britain/prince_highness.htm|title=Styles of the members of the British royal family}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://royalmusingsblogspotcom.blogspot.lt/2013/08/british-titles-etc-rules-are-hard-and.html|title=British titles, etc: the rules ARE Hard and Fast|date=7 August 2013}}</ref>\n\nOn 31 December 2012, [[Elizabeth II]] issued letters patent enabling all children of the eldest son of the [[Prince of Wales]] to enjoy the princely title and style of ''[[Royal Highness]]'', as opposed to only the eldest son.\n\n==Princesses of the blood royal and princesses by marriage==\n{{unreferenced section|date=April 2011}}\nUnder the current practice, princesses of the blood royal are the legitimate daughters and the legitimate male line granddaughters of a [[King of the United Kingdom|British Sovereign]]. They are [[dynasts]], that is potential successors to the throne. For these individuals, the title \"Princess of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland\" and the style \"Her Royal Highness\" is an entitlement for life. The title Princess and the style [[Royal Highness]] is prefixed to the Christian name, before another title of honour. From 1714 until 1917, the male-line great-granddaughters of the Sovereign were titled \"Princess of Great Britain and Ireland\" with the style \"Highness\". Since 1917,<ref name=\"LettersPatentNov1917\"/> the male-line great-granddaughters of the Sovereign have held \"the style and title enjoyed by the children of dukes\". For example, the daughters of the current [[Prince Richard, Duke of Gloucester|Duke of Gloucester]], a male line grandson of George V, are styled [[Lady Davina Lewis|The Lady Davina Lewis]] and [[Lady Rose Gilman|The Lady Rose Gilman]].\n\nPrincesses by marriage are the recognised wives of the Sovereign's sons and male-line grandsons.<ref name=\"LettersPatentNov1917\"/> Generally, these women are entitled to the style \"Royal Highness\" by virtue of marriage, and retain the style if widowed. However, Queen Elizabeth II issued Letters Patent dated 21 August 1996 stating that any woman divorced from a Prince of the United Kingdom would no longer be entitled to the style \"Royal Highness\". This has so far applied to [[Diana, Princess of Wales]], and [[Sarah, Duchess of York]].\n\nSince the passage of the [[Royal Marriages Act 1772]], there have been several instances in which princes of the blood contracted marriages in contravention of that act (which meant they were not legally married) and several instances in which the Sovereign withheld the style \"Her Royal Highness\" from a prince's wife deemed to be unsuitable. For example, [[Prince George, Duke of Cambridge]], a male-line grandson of [[George III of the United Kingdom|George III]], married Sarah Louisa Fairbrother, in contravention of the Royal Marriages Act. Although morganatic marriage did not exist in British law, the duke's wife was never titled the Duchess of Cambridge or accorded the style \"Her Royal Highness\". Instead, she was known as \"Mrs FitzGeorge\". Most famously, [[George VI]] issued Letters Patent dated 27 May 1937 that entitled [[Edward VIII|The Duke of Windsor]] \"to hold and enjoy for himself only the title style or attribute of Royal Highness so however that his wife and descendants if any shall not hold the said title style or attribute\".\n\nThe wife of a prince of the blood takes her husband's Christian name<ref>[http://www.royal.gov.uk/ThecurrentRoyalFamily/TheCountessofWessex/Stylesandtitles.aspx Countess of Wessex official page] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120327100106/http://www.royal.gov.uk/ThecurrentRoyalFamily/TheCountessofWessex/Stylesandtitles.aspx |date=27 March 2012 }}</ref><ref>[https://twitter.com/MajestyMagazine/status/363595551738040321/photo/1 Photo].</ref> in her title as do all married royal women. For example, upon her marriage to [[Prince Michael of Kent]] in 1978, [[Princess Michael of Kent|Baroness Marie-Christine von Reibnitz]] assumed the title and style of \"Her Royal Highness Princess Michael of Kent\". Similarly, upon her marriage to then [[Prince Richard, Duke of Gloucester|Prince Richard of Gloucester]], the former [[Birgitte, Duchess of Gloucester|Birgitte van Deurs]] assumed the title and style of \"Her Royal Highness Princess Richard of Gloucester\".\n\nThe situation is slightly different when a woman is married to a prince who happens to be a peer or the [[Prince of Wales]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}} Upon marriage, the wife of the Prince of Wales becomes \"Her Royal Highness The Princess of Wales\". Upon marriage, the wife of a royal duke (or earl) becomes \"Her Royal Highness The Duchess (or Countess) of X\". When Prince Richard of Gloucester succeeded to his father's dukedom in 1974, his wife became \"Her Royal Highness The Duchess of Gloucester\".\n\nThere is also the case when a princess of blood royal marries a British Prince, she also becomes a princess by marriage and will be address in the same way, an example of this situation was the late [[Princess Alexandra, Duchess of Fife]], when she married his cousin [[Prince Arthur of Connaught]] became \"Princess Arthur of Connaught, Duchess of Fife\"\n\nIt has been traditional, and is still technically the case,{{citation needed|date=January 2015}} that a princess by marriage cannot be called Princess followed by her first name. [[Diana, Princess of Wales]], was consistently referred to as \"Princess Diana\" by fans and the media, but the use of this title is completely erroneous, as she was not the child of a monarch nor the child of a son of a monarch. However, this tradition was broken once in the past century with [[Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth]]'s aunt, [[Princess Alice, Duchess of Gloucester]], being referred to\u2014with permission from the sovereign\u2014in official sources as such following the death of her husband.<ref name=\"princessalice\"/>\n\n==History==\nThe use of the titles prince and princess and the styles of Highness and Royal Highness for members of the Royal Family is of fairly recent usage in the British Isles. Before 1714,<ref name=\"LettersPatentNov1917\"/> there was no settled practice regarding the use of the titles prince and princess other than the [[heir apparent]] and his wife. From 1301 onward, the eldest sons of the [[List of the monarchs of the Kingdom of England|Kings of England]] (and later Great Britain and the United Kingdom) have generally been created [[Prince of Wales|Prince of Wales and Earl of Chester]]. Their wives were titled [[Princess of Wales]].\n\nThe title [[Princess Royal]] came into being in 1642{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}} when [[Henrietta Maria of France|Queen Henrietta Maria]], the French-born wife of [[Charles I of England|Charles I]], wished to imitate the way the eldest daughter of the French King was styled (''Madame Royale''). However, there was no settled practice on the use of the title princess for the Sovereign's younger daughters or male-line granddaughters. For example, as late as the time of [[Charles II of England|Charles II]], the daughters of his brother [[James II of England|James, Duke of York]], both of whom became Queens regnant, were called simply \"The Lady Mary\" and \"The Lady Anne\". The future [[Anne, Queen of Great Britain|Queen Anne]] was styled princess in her marriage treaty to [[Prince George of Denmark]] and then styled \"Princess Anne of Denmark\" once married. However, in exile at [[Saint-Germain-en-Laye]] the deposed James II gave the title of Princess Royal to his last daughter, [[Louisa Maria Teresa Stuart|Louisa Maria]] (1692\u20131712).\n\nAfter the accession of George I of Hanover, the princely titles were changed to follow the German practice.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}} The children, grandchildren, and male line great-grandchildren of the British Sovereign were automatically titled \"Prince or Princess of Great Britain and Ireland\" and styled \"Royal Highness\" (in the case of children and grandchildren) or \"Highness\" (in the case of male line great-grandchildren). [[Queen Victoria]] confirmed this practice in Letters Patent dated 30 January 1864 (the first Act of the Prerogative dealing with the princely title in general terms).<ref>[http://www.heraldica.org/topics/britain/prince_highness_docs.htm#1864 Royal Styles and Titles&nbsp;\u2013 1864 Letters Patent].</ref>\n\nOn 31 December 2012, [[Elizabeth II]] issued letters patent enabling all children of the eldest son of the [[Prince of Wales]] to enjoy the princely title and style of ''[[Royal Highness]]'', as opposed to only the eldest son.<ref>{{London Gazette |issue=60384 |page=213 |date=8 January 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Royal baby girl 'would be princess'|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-20962102|date=9 January 2013|newspaper=BBC News|accessdate=6 July 2013}}</ref>\n\n==Styling of princesses==\n{{Refimprove section|date=January 2013}}\n\n===Princesses of the blood royal===\n*Daughter of a Sovereign: ''HRH The Princess N''.\n**The style ''HRH The [[Princess Royal]]'' is customarily (but not automatically) granted by the Sovereign, when vacant, to the Sovereign's eldest daughter.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.royal.gov.uk/output/Page5660.asp|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080727135946/http://www.royal.gov.uk/output/Page5660.asp|url-status=dead|archive-date=27 July 2008|last=The Royal Family|title=Style and Title of the Princess Royal|accessdate=10 February 2017}}</ref>\n*Daughter of a son of a Sovereign: ''HRH Princess N of X'', where ''X'' is the territorial designation of their father's senior peerage; e.g. ''HRH [[Princess Alexandra, The Honourable Lady Ogilvy|Princess Alexandra of Kent]]''.\n**Prior to [[Princess Charlotte of Wales|Princess Charlotte]], a daughter of the Prince of Wales: ''HRH Princess N''\n**Prior to 1917,{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}} a daughter of a son of a son of a Sovereign: ''HH Princess N of X''\n*From 31 December 2012, daughter of the eldest son of the Prince of Wales: ''HRH Princess N of X''.\n\nWhen a princess marries, she still takes on her husband's title. If the title is higher than (or equal to) the one she possesses, she will normally be styled using the female equivalent.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}} If her husband has a lower title or style, her style as a princess remains in use, although it may then be combined with her style by marriage, e.g. ''HRH The [[Princess Louise, Duchess of Argyll]]'' or ''HRH [[Princess Alice, Countess of Athlone]]''&nbsp;\u2013 if that princess had a territorial designation, she may cease its use. However, some of the lowest styles are not utilised by senior royals&nbsp;\u2014 Princess Anne remains ''HRH The Princess Royal'' rather than ''HRH The Princess Royal, Lady Laurence''.\n\n===Use of the title Princess by virtue of marriage ===\nA woman who marries a Prince does not become a Princess in her own right, but rather is permitted to use the substantive title \"Princess Husband's name\"; this is akin to a woman being referred to as \"Mrs. John Smith\".<ref name=\"LettersPatentNov1917\"/> The only recent time this has broken tradition is with the Sovereign's express consent. Namely, with [[Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth's]] aunts [[Princess Alice, Duchess of Gloucester]], and [[Princess Marina, Duchess of Kent]]. The former was not a princess by birth, while the latter was born a princess of Greece and Denmark. Both women asked the Queen to use their given names to avoid confusion with their daughters-in-law's titles after their husbands' deaths.<ref name=\"princessalice\">{{cite web|url=http://www.royal.gov.uk/HistoryoftheMonarchy/The%20House%20of%20Windsor%20from%201952/HRHPrincessAlice/Marriageandfamily.aspx|title=Princess Alice, Duchess of Gloucester \u2013 Marriage and family|work=The British Monarchy|accessdate=18 May 2015|url-status=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090216150216/http://www.royal.gov.uk/HistoryoftheMonarchy/The%20House%20of%20Windsor%20from%201952/HRHPrincessAlice/Marriageandfamily.aspx|archivedate=19 May 2018}}</ref>\n\n*Wife of a prince who has a peerage: ''HRH The Duchess/Countess of X'', or, prior to 1917, possibly ''HH''\n**Since 1996, divorced wife of a prince who held a peerage: ''N, Duchess/Countess of X''.

The sisters [[Princess Sophia of Gloucester|Sophia Matilda]] and [[Princess Caroline of Gloucester|Caroline Augusta Maria]] born in 1773 and 1774 were male line great-granddaughters of George II. All of the other exceptions were still alive in 1917 and were no longer permitted to use the style of HRH and Princess except for one niece of George V who used the title until her marriage in 1923.\n\nThere have been several exceptions in recent history to these rules, but all have come by order of the Sovereign, mostly through [[letters patent]]. \n*In November 1905, [[Edward VII]] allowed the two daughters of [[Louise, Princess Royal]] to use a princely title and the style of ''[[Highness]]''.<ref>''Genealogisches Handbuch des Adels, F\u00fcrstliche H\u00e4user Band III.'' \"Fife\". C.A. Starke Verlag, 1955, pp. 336\u2013337. (German).</ref> They were not entitled to the style of [[Royal Highness]], and indeed [[Princess Maud, Countess of Southesk]], discontinued the use of \"Princess\" after her marriage. The 1917 letters patent which stripped great-grandchildren of a British sovereign of the style of ''Highness'' with a princely title was complicated as it did not technically overrule Edward VII's letters patent, as the former practice was mostly an unspoken courtesy as opposed to a written rule. The Countess of Southesk did honor her uncle's wishes in that respect after her marriage, and Princess Alexandra did not need to choose as she married a male-line grandson of [[Queen Victoria]].\n*[[Anne, Princess Royal]], had the style and title Her Royal Highness Princess Anne of Edinburgh from birth in 1950, even though she was a female-line grandchild of the Sovereign, being born to the future [[Elizabeth II]], then Princess Elizabeth, Duchess of Edinburgh, during the reign of Elizabeth's father, [[George VI]], who had no sons. George VI issued letters patent on 22 October 1948, granting the style to Elizabeth's children.\n*In 1961, when her son married, [[Princess Marina, Duchess of Kent|The Duchess of Kent]] asked [[Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth]] to extend the use of a princely title to precede her first name, in order to avoid confusion with her daughter-in-law, [[Katharine Worsley]], the new Duchess of Kent. As she was born a princess of Greece and Denmark, this was not incredibly notable, although traditionally she would have been styled as ''Her Royal Highness'' The Dowager Duchess of Kent. After this she was styled as ''Her Royal Highness'' Princess Marina, Duchess of Kent. \n*In 1974, the [[Princess Alice, Duchess of Gloucester|Duchess of Gloucester]] asked Queen Elizabeth for the same title as her sister-in-law, then Princess Marina, Duchess of Kent, with a princely title preceding her first name. Unlike Princess Marina, Alice had never been a princess in her own right, thus this allowance was far more unusual. Instead of being referred to as ''Her Royal Highness'' The Dowager Duchess of Gloucester, as is customary, she became ''Her Royal Highness'' Princess Alice, Duchess of Gloucester.\n*In 2003, upon the request of Queen Elizabeth's youngest son, [[Prince Edward, Earl of Wessex|Edward]], the Queen retracted the style of Royal Highness and princely title from all children born to him.<ref name=\"Official Statement\">[http://www.royal.gov.uk/LatestNewsandDiary/Pressreleases/2004/FamilyphotographsofTheEarlandCountessofWessexwitht.aspx Statement issued by the Press Secretary to the Queen: Announcement of the christening of Lady Louise Windsor] - The official website of The British Monarchy</ref> As male-line grandchildren of a British monarch, [[Lady Louise Windsor]] and [[James, Viscount Severn]], would traditionally enjoy a princely title and style.\n*In December 2012, Queen Elizabeth issued letters patent that stated that all children born to the eldest child of [[Charles, Prince of Wales]], would enjoy a princely title and style, and not just the eldest son. Although in effect in 2012, it did not technically come into usage until the birth of [[Princess Charlotte of Cambridge]] in 2015.\n\n==List of princesses of the blood royal since 1714==\n{|class=\"wikitable\" \n|-\n|style=\"background:#d0def8\"|Princess of Great Britain from birth\n|-\n|style=\"background:#ead0f8\"|Princess of the United Kingdom from birth\n|-\n|style=\"background:#def8d0\"|Created Princess of Great Britain by the sovereign\n|-\n|style=\"background:#f8ead0\"|Created Princess of the United Kingdom by the sovereign\n|-\n|}\n\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!style=\"width:20%\"|Title at birth\n!style=\"width:5%\" |Birth\n!style=\"width:5%\" |Death\n!style=\"width:20%\" |Lineage\n!style=\"width:50%\" |Comments\n|-\n|style=\"background:#def8d0\"|[[Sophia Dorothea of Hanover|Sophia Dorothea]]\n|style=\"background:#def8d0\"|1687\n|style=\"background:#def8d0\"|1757\n|style=\"background:#def8d0\"|Only daughter of [[George I of Great Britain|King George I]]\n|style=\"background:#def8d0\"|Gained title in 1714 upon accession of her father as King George I.<br/>Queen-consort of [[Prussia]] 1713\u20131740.\n|-\n|style=\"background:#def8d0\"|[[Anne, Princess Royal and Princess of Orange|Anne]]\n|style=\"background:#def8d0\"|1709\n|style=\"background:#def8d0\"|1759\n|style=\"background:#def8d0\"|1st daughter of [[George II of Great Britain|King George II]]\n|style=\"background:#def8d0\"|Gained title in 1714 upon accession of her grandfather as King George I.

For example, the daughters of the current [[Prince Richard, Duke of Gloucester|Duke of Gloucester]], a male line grandson of George V, are styled [[Lady Davina Lewis|The Lady Davina Lewis]] and [[Lady Rose Gilman|The Lady Rose Gilman]].\n\nPrincesses by marriage are the recognised wives of the Sovereign's sons and male-line grandsons.<ref name=\"LettersPatentNov1917\"/> Generally, these women are entitled to the style \"Royal Highness\" by virtue of marriage, and retain the style if widowed. However, Queen Elizabeth II issued Letters Patent dated 21 August 1996 stating that any woman divorced from a Prince of the United Kingdom would no longer be entitled to the style \"Royal Highness\". This has so far applied to [[Diana, Princess of Wales]], and [[Sarah, Duchess of York]].\n\nSince the passage of the [[Royal Marriages Act 1772]], there have been several instances in which princes of the blood contracted marriages in contravention of that act (which meant they were not legally married) and several instances in which the Sovereign withheld the style \"Her Royal Highness\" from a prince's wife deemed to be unsuitable. For example, [[Prince George, Duke of Cambridge]], a male-line grandson of [[George III of the United Kingdom|George III]], married Sarah Louisa Fairbrother, in contravention of the Royal Marriages Act. Although morganatic marriage did not exist in British law, the duke's wife was never titled the Duchess of Cambridge or accorded the style \"Her Royal Highness\". Instead, she was known as \"Mrs FitzGeorge\". Most famously, [[George VI]] issued Letters Patent dated 27 May 1937 that entitled [[Edward VIII|The Duke of Windsor]] \"to hold and enjoy for himself only the title style or attribute of Royal Highness so however that his wife and descendants if any shall not hold the said title style or attribute\".\n\nThe wife of a prince of the blood takes her husband's Christian name<ref>[http://www.royal.gov.uk/ThecurrentRoyalFamily/TheCountessofWessex/Stylesandtitles.aspx Countess of Wessex official page] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120327100106/http://www.royal.gov.uk/ThecurrentRoyalFamily/TheCountessofWessex/Stylesandtitles.aspx |date=27 March 2012 }}</ref><ref>[https://twitter.com/MajestyMagazine/status/363595551738040321/photo/1 Photo].</ref> in her title as do all married royal women. For example, upon her marriage to [[Prince Michael of Kent]] in 1978, [[Princess Michael of Kent|Baroness Marie-Christine von Reibnitz]] assumed the title and style of \"Her Royal Highness Princess Michael of Kent\". Similarly, upon her marriage to then [[Prince Richard, Duke of Gloucester|Prince Richard of Gloucester]], the former [[Birgitte, Duchess of Gloucester|Birgitte van Deurs]] assumed the title and style of \"Her Royal Highness Princess Richard of Gloucester\".\n\nThe situation is slightly different when a woman is married to a prince who happens to be a peer or the [[Prince of Wales]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}} Upon marriage, the wife of the Prince of Wales becomes \"Her Royal Highness The Princess of Wales\". Upon marriage, the wife of a royal duke (or earl) becomes \"Her Royal Highness The Duchess (or Countess) of X\". When Prince Richard of Gloucester succeeded to his father's dukedom in 1974, his wife became \"Her Royal Highness The Duchess of Gloucester\".\n\nThere is also the case when a princess of blood royal marries a British Prince, she also becomes a princess by marriage and will be address in the same way, an example of this situation was the late [[Princess Alexandra, Duchess of Fife]], when she got married to his cousin [[Prince Arthur of Connaught]] became \"Princess Arthur of Connaught, Duchess of Fife\"\n\nIt has been traditional, and is still technically the case,{{citation needed|date=January 2015}} that a princess by marriage cannot be called Princess followed by her first name. [[Diana, Princess of Wales]], was consistently referred to as \"Princess Diana\" by fans and the media, but the use of this title is completely erroneous, as she was not the child of a monarch nor the child of a son of a monarch. However, this tradition was broken once in the past century with [[Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth]]'s aunt, [[Princess Alice, Duchess of Gloucester]], being referred to\u2014with permission from the sovereign\u2014in official sources as such following the death of her husband.<ref name=\"princessalice\"/>\n\n==History==\nThe use of the titles prince and princess and the styles of Highness and Royal Highness for members of the Royal Family is of fairly recent usage in the British Isles. Before 1714,<ref name=\"LettersPatentNov1917\"/> there was no settled practice regarding the use of the titles prince and princess other than the [[heir apparent]] and his wife. From 1301 onward, the eldest sons of the [[List of the monarchs of the Kingdom of England|Kings of England]] (and later Great Britain and the United Kingdom) have generally been created [[Prince of Wales|Prince of Wales and Earl of Chester]]. Their wives were titled [[Princess of Wales]].\n\nThe title [[Princess Royal]] came into being in 1642{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}} when [[Henrietta Maria of France|Queen Henrietta Maria]], the French-born wife of [[Charles I of England|Charles I]], wished to imitate the way the eldest daughter of the French King was styled (''Madame Royale''). However, there was no settled practice on the use of the title princess for the Sovereign's younger daughters or male-line granddaughters. For example, as late as the time of [[Charles II of England|Charles II]], the daughters of his brother [[James II of England|James, Duke of York]], both of whom became Queens regnant, were called simply \"The Lady Mary\" and \"The Lady Anne\". The future [[Anne, Queen of Great Britain|Queen Anne]] was styled princess in her marriage treaty to [[Prince George of Denmark]] and then styled \"Princess Anne of Denmark\" once married. However, in exile at [[Saint-Germain-en-Laye]] the deposed James II gave the title of Princess Royal to his last daughter, [[Louisa Maria Teresa Stuart|Louisa Maria]] (1692\u20131712).\n\nAfter the accession of George I of Hanover, the princely titles were changed to follow the German practice.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}} The children, grandchildren, and male line great-grandchildren of the British Sovereign were automatically titled \"Prince or Princess of Great Britain and Ireland\" and styled \"Royal Highness\" (in the case of children and grandchildren) or \"Highness\" (in the case of male line great-grandchildren). [[Queen Victoria]] confirmed this practice in Letters Patent dated 30 January 1864 (the first Act of the Prerogative dealing with the princely title in general terms).<ref>[http://www.heraldica.org/topics/britain/prince_highness_docs.htm#1864 Royal Styles and Titles&nbsp;\u2013 1864 Letters Patent].</ref>\n\nOn 31 December 2012, [[Elizabeth II]] issued letters patent enabling all children of the eldest son of the [[Prince of Wales]] to enjoy the princely title and style of ''[[Royal Highness]]'', as opposed to only the eldest son.<ref>{{London Gazette |issue=60384 |page=213 |date=8 January 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Royal baby girl 'would be princess'|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-20962102|date=9 January 2013|newspaper=BBC News|accessdate=6 July 2013}}</ref>\n\n==Styling of princesses==\n{{Refimprove section|date=January 2013}}\n\n===Princesses of the blood royal===\n*Daughter of a Sovereign: ''HRH The Princess N''.\n**The style ''HRH The [[Princess Royal]]'' is customarily (but not automatically) granted by the Sovereign, when vacant, to the Sovereign's eldest daughter.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.royal.gov.uk/output/Page5660.asp|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080727135946/http://www.royal.gov.uk/output/Page5660.asp|url-status=dead|archive-date=27 July 2008|last=The Royal Family|title=Style and Title of the Princess Royal|accessdate=10 February 2017}}</ref>\n*Daughter of a son of a Sovereign: ''HRH Princess N of X'', where ''X'' is the territorial designation of their father's senior peerage; e.g. ''HRH [[Princess Alexandra, The Honourable Lady Ogilvy|Princess Alexandra of Kent]]''.\n**Prior to [[Princess Charlotte of Wales|Princess Charlotte]], a daughter of the Prince of Wales: ''HRH Princess N''\n**Prior to 1917,{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}} a daughter of a son of a son of a Sovereign: ''HH Princess N of X''\n*From 31 December 2012, daughter of the eldest son of the Prince of Wales: ''HRH Princess N of X''.\n\nWhen a princess marries, she still takes on her husband's title. If the title is higher than (or equal to) the one she possesses, she will normally be styled using the female equivalent.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}} If her husband has a lower title or style, her style as a princess remains in use, although it may then be combined with her style by marriage, e.g. ''HRH The [[Princess Louise, Duchess of Argyll]]'' or ''HRH [[Princess Alice, Countess of Athlone]]''&nbsp;\u2013 if that princess had a territorial designation, she may cease its use. However, some of the lowest styles are not utilised by senior royals&nbsp;\u2014 Princess Anne remains ''HRH The Princess Royal'' rather than ''HRH The Princess Royal, Lady Laurence''.\n\n===Use of the title Princess by virtue of marriage ===\nA woman who marries a Prince does not become a Princess in her own right, but rather is permitted to use the substantive title \"Princess Husband's name\"; this is akin to a woman being referred to as \"Mrs. John Smith\".<ref name=\"LettersPatentNov1917\"/> The only recent time this has broken tradition is with the Sovereign's express consent. Namely, with [[Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth's]] aunts [[Princess Alice, Duchess of Gloucester]], and [[Princess Marina, Duchess of Kent]]. The former was not a princess by birth, while the latter was born a princess of Greece and Denmark. Both women asked the Queen to use their given names to avoid confusion with their daughters-in-law's titles after their husbands' deaths.<ref name=\"princessalice\">{{cite web|url=http://www.royal.gov.uk/HistoryoftheMonarchy/The%20House%20of%20Windsor%20from%201952/HRHPrincessAlice/Marriageandfamily.aspx|title=Princess Alice, Duchess of Gloucester \u2013 Marriage and family|work=The British Monarchy|accessdate=18 May 2015|url-status=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090216150216/http://www.royal.gov.uk/HistoryoftheMonarchy/The%20House%20of%20Windsor%20from%201952/HRHPrincessAlice/Marriageandfamily.aspx|archivedate=19 May 2018}}</ref>\n\n*Wife of a prince who has a peerage: ''HRH The Duchess/Countess of X'', or, prior to 1917, possibly ''HH''\n**Since 1996, divorced wife of a prince who held a peerage: ''N, Duchess/Countess of X''.

The sisters [[Princess Sophia of Gloucester|Sophia Matilda]] and [[Princess Caroline of Gloucester|Caroline Augusta Maria]] born in 1773 and 1774 were male line great-granddaughters of George II. All of the other exceptions were still alive in 1917 and were no longer permitted to use the style of HRH and Princess except for one niece of George V who used the title until her marriage in 1923.\n\nThere have been several exceptions in recent history to these rules, but all have come by order of the Sovereign, mostly through [[letters patent]]. \n*In November 1905, [[Edward VII]] allowed the two daughters of [[Louise, Princess Royal]] to use a princely title and the style of ''[[Highness]]''.<ref>''Genealogisches Handbuch des Adels, F\u00fcrstliche H\u00e4user Band III.'' \"Fife\". C.A. Starke Verlag, 1955, pp. 336\u2013337. (German).</ref> They were not entitled to the style of [[Royal Highness]], and indeed [[Princess Maud, Countess of Southesk]], discontinued the use of \"Princess\" after her marriage. The 1917 letters patent which stripped great-grandchildren of a British sovereign of the style of ''Highness'' with a princely title was complicated as it did not technically overrule Edward VII's letters patent, as the former practice was mostly an unspoken courtesy as opposed to a written rule. The Countess of Southesk did honor her uncle's wishes in that respect after her marriage, and Princess Alexandra did not need to choose as she married a male-line grandson of [[Queen Victoria]].\n*[[Anne, Princess Royal]], had the style and title Her Royal Highness Princess Anne of Edinburgh from birth in 1950, even though she was a female-line grandchild of the Sovereign, being born to the future [[Elizabeth II]], then Princess Elizabeth, Duchess of Edinburgh, during the reign of Elizabeth's father, [[George VI]], who had no sons. George VI issued letters patent on 22 October 1948, granting the style to Elizabeth's children.\n*In 1961, when her son married, [[Princess Marina, Duchess of Kent|The Duchess of Kent]] asked [[Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth]] to extend the use of a princely title to precede her first name, in order to avoid confusion with her daughter-in-law, [[Katharine Worsley]], the new Duchess of Kent. As she was born a princess of Greece and Denmark, this was not incredibly notable, although traditionally she would have been styled as ''Her Royal Highness'' The Dowager Duchess of Kent. After this she was styled as ''Her Royal Highness'' Princess Marina, Duchess of Kent. \n*In 1974, the [[Princess Alice, Duchess of Gloucester|Duchess of Gloucester]] asked Queen Elizabeth for the same title as her sister-in-law, then Princess Marina, Duchess of Kent, with a princely title preceding her first name. Unlike Princess Marina, Alice had never been a princess in her own right, thus this allowance was far more unusual. Instead of being referred to as ''Her Royal Highness'' The Dowager Duchess of Gloucester, as is customary, she became ''Her Royal Highness'' Princess Alice, Duchess of Gloucester.\n*In 2003, upon the request of Queen Elizabeth's youngest son, [[Prince Edward, Earl of Wessex|Edward]], the Queen retracted the style of Royal Highness and princely title from all children born to him.<ref name=\"Official Statement\">[http://www.royal.gov.uk/LatestNewsandDiary/Pressreleases/2004/FamilyphotographsofTheEarlandCountessofWessexwitht.aspx Statement issued by the Press Secretary to the Queen: Announcement of the christening of Lady Louise Windsor] - The official website of The British Monarchy</ref> As male-line grandchildren of a British monarch, [[Lady Louise Windsor]] and [[James, Viscount Severn]], would traditionally enjoy a princely title and style.\n*In December 2012, Queen Elizabeth issued letters patent that stated that all children born to the eldest child of [[Charles, Prince of Wales]], would enjoy a princely title and style, and not just the eldest son. Although in effect in 2012, it did not technically come into usage until the birth of [[Princess Charlotte of Cambridge]] in 2015.\n\n==List of princesses of the blood royal since 1714==\n{|class=\"wikitable\" \n|-\n|style=\"background:#d0def8\"|Princess of Great Britain from birth\n|-\n|style=\"background:#ead0f8\"|Princess of the United Kingdom from birth\n|-\n|style=\"background:#def8d0\"|Created Princess of Great Britain by the sovereign\n|-\n|style=\"background:#f8ead0\"|Created Princess of the United Kingdom by the sovereign\n|-\n|}\n\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!style=\"width:20%\"|Title at birth\n!style=\"width:5%\" |Birth\n!style=\"width:5%\" |Death\n!style=\"width:20%\" |Lineage\n!style=\"width:50%\" |Comments\n|-\n|style=\"background:#def8d0\"|[[Sophia Dorothea of Hanover|Sophia Dorothea]]\n|style=\"background:#def8d0\"|1687\n|style=\"background:#def8d0\"|1757\n|style=\"background:#def8d0\"|Only daughter of [[George I of Great Britain|King George I]]\n|style=\"background:#def8d0\"|Gained title in 1714 upon accession of her father as King George I.<br/>Queen-consort of [[Prussia]] 1713\u20131740.\n|-\n|style=\"background:#def8d0\"|[[Anne, Princess Royal and Princess of Orange|Anne]]\n|style=\"background:#def8d0\"|1709\n|style=\"background:#def8d0\"|1759\n|style=\"background:#def8d0\"|1st daughter of [[George II of Great Britain|King George II]]\n|style=\"background:#def8d0\"|Gained title in 1714 upon accession of her grandfather as King George I.

It stretches roughly from west to east between the mosques [[Bayezid II Mosque, Istanbul|of Beyazit]] and [[Nuruosmaniye Mosque|of Nuruosmaniye]].

It was also near the first sultan's palace, the Old Palace ({{lang|tr|Eski Saray}}), which was also in construction in those same years, and not far from the Artopoleia (in Greek) ({{lang|grc|\u0386\u03c1\u03c4\u03bf\u03c0\u03c9\u03bb\u03b5\u03af\u03b1}}), the city's bakers' quarter in [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] times.<ref name=ja95>Janin (1964), p. 95.</ref>\n\nThe construction of the Bedesten ended in the winter of 1460/61, and the building was endowed to the ''[[waqf]]'' of the [[Hagia Sophia]] Mosque. Analysis of the [[brickwork]] shows that most of the structure originates from the second half of the 15th century, although a Byzantine relief representing a [[Komnenos|Comnenian]] eagle, still enclosed on the top of the East Gate ({{lang|tr|Kuyumcular Kap\u0131s\u0131)}}) of the Bedesten has been used by several scholars as proof that the edifice was a Byzantine structure.<ref name=mw345/>\n\nIn a market near the Bedesten, named in Turkish {{lang|tr|Esir Pazar\u0131}}, the [[slave trade]] was active, a use also carried over from Byzantine times.<ref name=mw346/> Other important markets in the vicinity were the second-hand market ({{lang-tr|Bit Pazar\u0131}}),<ref name=man177/> the \"Long Market\" ({{lang|tr|Uzun \u00c7ar\u015f\u0131}}), corresponding to the Greek ''Makros Embolos'' ({{lang|grc|\u039c\u03b1\u03ba\u03c1\u03cc\u03c2 \u1fc8\u03bc\u03b2\u03bf\u03bb\u03bf\u03c2}}, \"Long Portico\"), a long [[portico]]ed mall stretching downhill from the [[Forum of Constantine]] to the [[Golden Horn]], which was one of the main market areas of the city,<ref>Mamboury (1953), p. 212</ref> while the old book market ({{lang|tr|Sahaflar \u00c7ar\u015f\u0131s\u0131}}) was moved from the Bazaar to the present picturesque location near the Beyazid Mosque only after the [[1894 Istanbul earthquake]].\n\nSome years later{{Hair space}}<ref name=gul8>G\u00fclersoy (1980), p. 8</ref>\u2014according to other sources,<ref name=mw346>M\u00fcller-Wiener (1977), p. 346.</ref> this occurred in 1545 under Sultan [[Suleiman the Magnificent|Suleiman I]]\u2014Mehmed II had another covered market built, the \"Sandal Bedesten\" (the name comes from a kind of thread woven in [[Bursa]], which had the colour of [[sandalwood]]<ref name=gul29>G\u00fclersoy (1980) p. 29</ref>), also named {{lang|tr|K\u00fc\u00e7\u00fck}} (\"Little\"), {{lang|tr|Cedit}} or {{lang|tr|Yeni}} (both words meaning \"New\") Bedesten, which lay north of the first.{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}\n\nAfter the erection of the Sandal Bedesten the trade in textiles moved there, while the {{lang|tr|Cevahir Bedesten}} was reserved for the trade in luxury goods. At the beginning the two buildings were isolated. According to the 16th-century French traveller [[Pierre Gilles]], between them and the Mosque of Beyazid stood the ruins of churches and a large [[cistern]].<ref name=mw346/> However, soon many sellers opened their shops between and around them, so that a whole quarter was born, devoted exclusively to commerce.\n\nAt the beginning of the 17th century the Grand Bazaar had already achieved its final shape. The enormous extent of the Ottoman Empire in three continents, and the total control of road communications between Asia and Europe, rendered the Bazaar and the surrounding ''han''s or [[caravanserai]]s the hub of the Mediterranean trade. According to several European travelers, at that time, and until the first half of the 19th century, the market was unrivaled in Europe with regards to the abundance, variety and quality of the goods on sale. At that time we know from European travelers that the Grand Bazaar had a square plan, with two perpendicular main roads crossing in the middle and a third road running along the outer perimeter.<ref name=man177/> In the Bazaar there were 67 roads (each bearing the name of the sellers of a particular good), several squares used for the daily prayers, 5 mosques, 7 fountains, 18 gates which were opened each day in the morning and closed in the evening (from these comes the modern name of the Market, \"Closed Market\" ({{lang|tr|Kapal\u0131\u00e7ar\u015f\u0131}}).<ref name=man177/> Around 1638 the Turkish traveller [[Evliya \u00c7elebi]] gave us the most important historical description of the Bazaar and of its customs. The number of shops amounted to 3,000, plus 300 located in the surrounding ''han''s, large caravanserais with two or three stories round a porticoed inner courtyard, where goods could be stored and merchants could be lodged.<ref name=gul17>G\u00fclersoy (1980) p. 17</ref> In that period one tenth of the shops of the city were concentrated in the market and around it.<ref name=man177/> For all that, at that time the market was not yet covered.\n[[File:Constantinople(1878)-New Picture (42).png|thumb|A {{lang|tr|dolap}} in a drawing of [[Cesare Biseo]], from [[Edmondo De Amicis]]'s ''Costantinopoli'' (1882 edition)]]\nRecurrent calamities, fires and earthquakes hit the Grand Bazaar. The first fire occurred in 1515; another in 1548.<ref name=mw346/> Other fires ravaged the complex in 1588, 1618 (when the {{lang|tr|Bit Pazar\u0131}} was destroyed), 1645, 1652, 1658, 1660 (on that occasion the whole city was devastated), 1687, 1688 (great damage occurred to the {{lang|tr|Uzun \u00c7ar\u015f\u0131}}) 1695, and 1701.<ref name=mw348>M\u00fcller-Wiener (1977), p. 348.</ref>  The fire of 1701 was particularly fierce, forcing [[Grand Vizier]] [[Nev\u015fehirli Damad Ibrahim Pasha]] to rebuild several parts of the complex in 1730\u20131731. In 1738 the [[Kizlar Agha|K\u0131zlar A\u011fas\u0131]] Be\u015fir A\u011fa endowed the Fountain (still existing) near Mercan Kap\u0131.\n\nIn this period, because of the new law against fires issued in 1696, several parts of the market which lay between the two Bedesten were covered with vaults.<ref name=mw346/> Despite that, other fires ravaged the complex in 1750 and 1791. The quake of 1766 caused more damages, which were repaired by the Court Chief Architect ({{lang|tr|Hassa Ba\u015f Mimar\u0131}}) Ahmet a year later.<ref name=mw348/>\n\nThe 19th-century growth of the textile industry in western Europe, introduction of mass production methods, the [[Capitulations of the Ottoman Empire|capitulations]] signed between the Empire and many European countries, and the forestalling \u2013 always by European merchants \u2013 of the raw materials needed to produce goods in the Empire's [[Autarky|closed economy]], were factors which caused the Market's decline.<ref name=gul31>G\u00fclersoy (1980), p. 31</ref> By 1850, rents in Bedesten were ten times lower than two to three decades before.<ref name=gul30>G\u00fclersoy (1980), p. 30</ref> Moreover, the birth of a West-oriented bourgeoisie and the commercial success of Western products pushed the merchants belonging to the [[Millet|minorities]] ([[Greeks|Greek]], [[Armenians|Armenian]], [[Jewish]]) into moving out of the Bazaar, perceived as antiquated, and into opening new shops in quarters frequented by Europeans, such as [[Beyo\u011flu|Pera]] and [[Galata]].<ref name=gul41>G\u00fclersoy (1980) p. 41</ref>\n\nAccording to an 1890 survey, in the Bazaar there were 4,399 active shops, 2 ''bedesten'', 2195 rooms, 1 [[Turkish bath|''hamam'']], one mosque, 10 [[medrese]], 19 fountains (among them two ''[[\u015fad\u0131rvan]]'' and one [[Sebil (drinking water facility)|''sebil'']]), one mausoleum and 24 ''han''.<ref name=ey27/> In the 30.7 hectares of the complex, protected by 18 gates, there are 3,000 shops along 61 streets, the 2 ''bedesten'', 13 ''han'' (plus several more outside).<ref name=mw349/>\n\nThe last major catastrophe happened in 1894: a strong earthquake that rocked Istanbul.<ref name=mw348/> The Minister of Public Works, Mahmud Celaleddin Pasha, supervised the repair of the damaged Bazaar until 1898, and on this occasion the complex was reduced in area. To the west, the Bit Pazar\u0131 was left outside the new perimeter and became an open-sky road, named ''\u00c7ad\u0131rc\u0131lar Caddesi'' (\"Tentmaker Road\"), while the old gate and the ''K\u00fctkculer Kapi'' were demolished. Among all the ''han''s which belonged to the Market, many were left outside, and only nine remained enclosed in the structure.\n\nIn 1914 the Sandal Bedesten, whose handlers of textile goods had been ruined by the European competition, was acquired by the city of Istanbul and, starting one year later, was used as an auction house, mainly for [[carpet]]s. In 1927 the individual parts of the bazaar and the streets got official names. The last fires of bazaar happened in 1943 and 1954, and the related restorations were finished on 28 July 1959.<ref name=gul13>G\u00fclersoy (1980) p. 13</ref>\n\nThe last restoration of the complex took place in 1980. On that occasion, advertising posters around the market were also removed.\n\n==Architecture==\n[[File:DSC04589 Istanbul - Bazaar - Foto G.

Two rows of stone piers, four in each row, sustain three rows of bays, five in each row. Each bay is surmounted by a brick dome with blind [[Tholobate|drum]]. In the inner and in the outer walls have been built 44 cellars ({{lang-tr|mahzen}}), vaulted rooms without external openings. The sunlight in Bedesten comes from rectangular  windows placed right under the roof: they can be accessed through a wooden ambulatory. Due to the scarce illumination, the edifice was kept open only some hours each day, and was devoted to the trade of luxury goods, above all textiles.<ref name=mw346/> Moreover, the Bedesten's Mahzen were also used as safes.<ref name=mw346/> The building can be accessed through four gates: \n* \"Second-hand Book Sellers' Gate\" ({{lang|tr|Sahaflar Kap\u0131s\u0131}}) in the north, \n* \"Skullcap Sellers' Gate\" ({{lang|tr|Takkeciler Kap\u0131s\u0131}}) in the south,\n* \"Jewellers' Gate\" ({{lang|tr|Kuyumcular Kap\u0131s\u0131}}) in the east, and;\n* \"Women's Clothiers' Gate\" ({{lang|tr|Zenneciler Kap\u0131s\u0131}}) in the west.<ref name=gul14>G\u00fclersoy (1980, p. 14</ref>\n\nThe '''Sandal Bedesten''' has also a rectangular plan (40.20 m \u00d7 42.20 m), with 12 stone piers bearing 20 bays surmounted by brick domes with blind drum. In this case shops are carved only in the outer walls.<ref name=ey27>Eyice (1955), p. 27.</ref> In both edifices, each bay is tied to the others through brick arches tied by juniper beams, and [[masonry]] is made with [[rubble]]. Both buildings were closed by iron gates.\n\nAside the Bedesten, originally the Grand Bazaar structures were built with wood, and only after the 1700 fire, they were rebuilt in stone and brickwork, and covered.<ref name=ey27/> All the bazaar edifices, except the fur dealers market ({{lang-tr|K\u00fcrk\u00e7\u00fcler \u00c7ars\u0131s\u0131}}), a later addition which is two-story, are one story.<ref name=gul15>G\u00fclersoy (1980, p. 15</ref> The roofs are mainly covered with tiles, while the part burnt in 1954 uses now [[Asphalt concrete|tarmac]]. In the bazaar no artificial light was foreseen, also to prevent fires, and smoking was strictly prohibited. The roads outside the inner Bedesten are roughly parallel to it. The damages caused by the many fires and quakes along the centuries, together with the repairs done without a general plan, gave to the market \u2013 especially in its western part \u2013 a picturesque appearance, with its maze of roads and lanes crossing each other at various angles.\n\n==Social history of the Grand Bazaar==\n[[File:Kapali Carsi-Grand Bazar-Istanbul-Sep08.jpg|thumb|Kalpak\u00e7\u0131lar Caddesi, the gold jewellers' road, is one of the 61 covered streets inside the Grand Bazaar.]]\nUntil the restoration following the quake of 1894, the Grand Bazaar had no shops as found in the western world: along both sides of the roads merchants sat on wooden divans in front of their shelves.<ref name=gul18>G\u00fclersoy (1980) p. 18</ref> Each of them occupied a space {{convert|6|to|8|ft|m}} in width, and {{convert|3|to|4|ft|m}} in depth.

These simple dishes were prepared and served in small two-story [[kiosk]]s placed in the middle of a road.<ref name=gul36/> The most famous among these kiosks is the one\u2014still extant but not functioning any more\u2014placed at the crossing of ''Hal\u0131c\u0131lar Caddesi'' and ''Ac\u0131 \u00c7esme Caddesi''.

In order to establish a new one, it was only necessary to have enough traders of the same good.<ref name=gul47>G\u00fclersoy (1980) p. 47</ref> Afterwards, a monopoly was formed and the number of traders and shops was frozen.<ref name=gul47/> One could only be accepted in the guild through co-optation, either as son of a deceased member, or after paying a suitable sum to a member who wanted to retire.<ref name=gul47/>\n\nThe guild's chief was a public officer called ''[[Keth\u00fcda]]''. He was paid by the guild but appointed by the ''[[Kad\u0131]]'' of Istanbul.<ref name=gul47/> Fixation of prices and taxes were matter of the ''Keth\u00fcda''. He was joined by a representative of the guild's member, called ''Yi\u011fitba\u015f\u0131'' ('chief of the brave young fellows').<ref name=gul47/> These two officers were flanked by the assembly of the elders, non necessarily old in age, but comprising the most experienced traders.<ref name=gul47/> Parallel to the guilds, there were purely religious organizations, called ''f\u00fct\u00fcvvet tariks''. Their members met in [[Dervish]] shrines and performed religious functions. These organizations became less and less important with time due to the increased weight of the Greek, Armenian and Jews merchants in the bazaar's trade.<ref name=gul47/> Each guild had a financial department which collected a moderate monthly fee (some [[Kuru\u015f|silver coins]]; {{lang-tr|Kuru\u015f}}) from the members and administered it taking care of the needs of each associated person.<ref name=gul47/> The guilds lost increasingly their importance during the Tanzimat period, and were abolished in 1913,<ref name=gul48>G\u00fclersoy (1980) p. 48</ref> being replaced by an association of Bazaar merchants.

Analysis of the [[brickwork]] shows that most of the structure originates from the second half of the 15th century, although a Byzantine relief representing a [[Komnenos|Comnenian]] eagle, still enclosed on the top of the East Gate ({{lang|tr|Kuyumcular Kap\u0131s\u0131)}}) of the Bedesten has been used by several scholars as proof that the edifice was a Byzantine structure.<ref name=mw345/>\n\nIn a market near the Bedesten, named in Turkish {{lang|tr|Esir Pazar\u0131}}, the [[slave trade]] was active, a use also carried over from Byzantine times.<ref name=mw346/> Other important markets in the vicinity were the second-hand market ({{lang-tr|Bit Pazar\u0131}}),<ref name=man177/> the \"Long Market\" ({{lang|tr|Uzun \u00c7ar\u015f\u0131}}), corresponding to the Greek ''Makros Embolos'' ({{lang|grc|\u039c\u03b1\u03ba\u03c1\u03cc\u03c2 \u1fc8\u03bc\u03b2\u03bf\u03bb\u03bf\u03c2}}, \"Long Portico\"), a long [[portico]]ed mall stretching downhill from the [[Forum of Constantine]] to the [[Golden Horn]], which was one of the main market areas of the city,<ref>Mamboury (1953), p. 212</ref> while the old book market ({{lang|tr|Sahaflar \u00c7ar\u015f\u0131s\u0131}}) was moved from the Bazaar to the present picturesque location near the Beyazid Mosque only after the [[1894 Istanbul earthquake]].\n\nSome years later{{Hair space}}<ref name=gul8>G\u00fclersoy (1980), p. 8</ref>\u2014according to other sources,<ref name=mw346>M\u00fcller-Wiener (1977), p. 346.</ref> this occurred in 1545 under Sultan [[Suleiman the Magnificent|Suleiman I]]\u2014Mehmed II had another covered market built, the \"Sandal Bedesten\" (the name comes from a kind of thread woven in [[Bursa]], which had the colour of [[sandalwood]]<ref name=gul29>G\u00fclersoy (1980) p. 29</ref>), also named {{lang|tr|K\u00fc\u00e7\u00fck}} (\"Little\"), {{lang|tr|Cedit}} or {{lang|tr|Yeni}} (both words meaning \"New\") Bedesten, which lay north of the first.{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}\n\nAfter the erection of the Sandal Bedesten the trade in textiles moved there, while the {{lang|tr|Cevahir Bedesten}} was reserved for the trade in luxury goods. At the beginning the two buildings were isolated. According to the 16th-century French traveller [[Pierre Gilles]], between them and the Mosque of Beyazid stood the ruins of churches and a large [[cistern]].<ref name=mw346/> However, soon many sellers opened their shops between and around them, so that a whole quarter was born, devoted exclusively to commerce.\n\nAt the beginning of the 17th century the Grand Bazaar had already achieved its final shape. The enormous extent of the Ottoman Empire in three continents, and the total control of road communications between Asia and Europe, rendered the Bazaar and the surrounding ''han''s or [[caravanserai]]s the hub of the Mediterranean trade. According to several European travelers, at that time, and until the first half of the 19th century, the market was unrivaled in Europe with regards to the abundance, variety and quality of the goods on sale. At that time we know from European travelers that the Grand Bazaar had a square plan, with two perpendicular main roads crossing in the middle and a third road running along the outer perimeter.<ref name=man177/> In the Bazaar there were 67 roads (each bearing the name of the sellers of a particular good), several squares used for the daily prayers, 5 mosques, 7 fountains, 18 gates which were opened each day in the morning and closed in the evening (from these comes the modern name of the Market, \"Closed Market\" ({{lang|tr|Kapal\u0131\u00e7ar\u015f\u0131}}).<ref name=man177/> Around 1638 the Turkish traveller [[Evliya \u00c7elebi]] gave us the most important historical description of the Bazaar and of its customs. The number of shops amounted to 3,000, plus 300 located in the surrounding ''han''s, large caravanserais with two or three stories round a porticoed inner courtyard, where goods could be stored and merchants could be lodged.<ref name=gul17>G\u00fclersoy (1980) p. 17</ref> In that period one tenth of the shops of the city were concentrated in the market and around it.<ref name=man177/> For all that, at that time the market was not yet covered.\n[[File:Constantinople(1878)-New Picture (42).png|thumb|A {{lang|tr|dolap}} in a drawing of [[Cesare Biseo]], from [[Edmondo De Amicis]]'s ''Costantinopoli'' (1882 edition)]]\nRecurrent calamities, fires and earthquakes hit the Grand Bazaar. The first fire occurred in 1515; another in 1548.<ref name=mw346/> Other fires ravaged the complex in 1588, 1618 (when the {{lang|tr|Bit Pazar\u0131}} was destroyed), 1645, 1652, 1658, 1660 (on that occasion the whole city was devastated), 1687, 1688 (great damage occurred to the {{lang|tr|Uzun \u00c7ar\u015f\u0131}}) 1695, and 1701.<ref name=mw348>M\u00fcller-Wiener (1977), p. 348.</ref>  The fire of 1701 was particularly fierce, forcing [[Grand Vizier]] [[Nev\u015fehirli Damad Ibrahim Pasha]] to rebuild several parts of the complex in 1730\u20131731. In 1738 the [[Kizlar Agha|K\u0131zlar A\u011fas\u0131]] Be\u015fir A\u011fa endowed the Fountain (still existing) near Mercan Kap\u0131.\n\nIn this period, because of the new law against fires issued in 1696, several parts of the market which lay between the two Bedesten were covered with vaults.<ref name=mw346/> Despite that, other fires ravaged the complex in 1750 and 1791. The quake of 1766 caused more damages, which were repaired by the Court Chief Architect ({{lang|tr|Hassa Ba\u015f Mimar\u0131}}) Ahmet a year later.<ref name=mw348/>\n\nThe 19th-century growth of the textile industry in western Europe, introduction of mass production methods, the [[Capitulations of the Ottoman Empire|capitulations]] signed between the Empire and many European countries, and the forestalling \u2013 always by European merchants \u2013 of the raw materials needed to produce goods in the Empire's [[Autarky|closed economy]], were factors which caused the Market's decline.<ref name=gul31>G\u00fclersoy (1980), p. 31</ref> By 1850, rents in Bedesten were ten times lower than two to three decades before.<ref name=gul30>G\u00fclersoy (1980), p. 30</ref> Moreover, the birth of a West-oriented bourgeoisie and the commercial success of Western products pushed the merchants belonging to the [[Millet|minorities]] ([[Greeks|Greek]], [[Armenians|Armenian]], [[Jewish]]) into moving out of the Bazaar, perceived as antiquated, and into opening new shops in quarters frequented by Europeans, such as [[Beyo\u011flu|Pera]] and [[Galata]].<ref name=gul41>G\u00fclersoy (1980) p. 41</ref>\n\nAccording to an 1890 survey, in the Bazaar there were 4,399 active shops, 2 ''bedesten'', 2195 rooms, 1 [[Turkish bath|''hamam'']], one mosque, 10 [[medrese]], 19 fountains (among them two ''[[\u015fad\u0131rvan]]'' and one [[Sebil (drinking water facility)|''sebil'']]), one mausoleum and 24 ''han''.<ref name=ey27/> In the 30.7 hectares of the complex, protected by 18 gates, there are 3,000 shops along 61 streets, the 2 ''bedesten'', 13 ''han'' (plus several more outside).<ref name=mw349/>\n\nThe last major catastrophe happened in 1894: a strong earthquake that rocked Istanbul.<ref name=mw348/> The Minister of Public Works, Mahmud Celaleddin Pasha, supervised the repair of the damaged Bazaar until 1898, and on this occasion the complex was reduced in area. To the west, the Bit Pazar\u0131 was left outside the new perimeter and became an open-sky road, named ''\u00c7ad\u0131rc\u0131lar Caddesi'' (\"Tentmaker Road\"), while the old gate and the ''K\u00fctkculer Kapi'' were demolished. Among all the ''han''s which belonged to the Market, many were left outside, and only nine remained enclosed in the structure.\n\nIn 1914 the Sandal Bedesten, whose handlers of textile goods had been ruined by the European competition, was acquired by the city of Istanbul and, starting one year later, was used as an auction house, mainly for [[carpet]]s. In 1927 the individual parts of the bazaar and the streets got official names. The last fires of bazaar happened in 1943 and 1954, and the related restorations were finished on 28 July 1959.<ref name=gul13>G\u00fclersoy (1980) p. 13</ref>\n\nThe last restoration of the complex took place in 1980. On that occasion, advertising posters around the market were also removed.\n\n==Architecture==\n[[File:DSC04589 Istanbul - Bazaar - Foto G. Dall'Orto 29-5-2006.jpg|thumb|left|170px|Nuruosmaniye Gate of the Grand Bazaar]]\nThe '''I\u00e7 Bedesten''' has a rectangular plan (43.30 m x 29.50 m). Two rows of stone piers, four in each row, sustain three rows of bays, five in each row. Each bay is surmounted by a brick dome with blind [[Tholobate|drum]]. In the inner and in the outer walls have been built 44 cellars ({{lang-tr|mahzen}}), vaulted rooms without external openings. The sunlight in Bedesten comes from rectangular  windows placed right under the roof: they can be accessed through a wooden ambulatory. Due to the scarce illumination, the edifice was kept open only some hours each day, and was devoted to the trade of luxury goods, above all textiles.<ref name=mw346/> Moreover, the Bedesten's Mahzen were also used as safes.<ref name=mw346/> The building can be accessed through four gates: \n* \"Second-hand Book Sellers' Gate\" ({{lang|tr|Sahaflar Kap\u0131s\u0131}}) in the north, \n* \"Skullcap Sellers' Gate\" ({{lang|tr|Takkeciler Kap\u0131s\u0131}}) in the south,\n* \"Jewellers' Gate\" ({{lang|tr|Kuyumcular Kap\u0131s\u0131}}) in the east, and;\n* \"Women's Clothiers' Gate\" ({{lang|tr|Zenneciler Kap\u0131s\u0131}}) in the west.<ref name=gul14>G\u00fclersoy (1980, p. 14</ref>\n\nThe '''Sandal Bedesten''' has also a rectangular plan (40.20 m \u00d7 42.20 m), with 12 stone piers bearing 20 bays surmounted by brick domes with blind drum. In this case shops are carved only in the outer walls.<ref name=ey27>Eyice (1955), p. 27.</ref> In both edifices, each bay is tied to the others through brick arches tied by juniper beams, and [[masonry]] is made with [[rubble]]. Both buildings were closed by iron gates.\n\nAside the Bedesten, originally the Grand Bazaar structures were built with wood, and only after the 1700 fire, they were rebuilt in stone and brickwork, and covered.<ref name=ey27/> All the bazaar edifices, except the fur dealers market ({{lang-tr|K\u00fcrk\u00e7\u00fcler \u00c7ars\u0131s\u0131}}), a later addition which is two-story, are one story.<ref name=gul15>G\u00fclersoy (1980, p. 15</ref> The roofs are mainly covered with tiles, while the part burnt in 1954 uses now [[Asphalt concrete|tarmac]]. In the bazaar no artificial light was foreseen, also to prevent fires, and smoking was strictly prohibited. The roads outside the inner Bedesten are roughly parallel to it. The damages caused by the many fires and quakes along the centuries, together with the repairs done without a general plan, gave to the market \u2013 especially in its western part \u2013 a picturesque appearance, with its maze of roads and lanes crossing each other at various angles.\n\n==Social history of the Grand Bazaar==\n[[File:Kapali Carsi-Grand Bazar-Istanbul-Sep08.jpg|thumb|Kalpak\u00e7\u0131lar Caddesi, the gold jewellers' road, is one of the 61 covered streets inside the Grand Bazaar.]]\nUntil the restoration following the quake of 1894, the Grand Bazaar had no shops as found in the western world: along both sides of the roads merchants sat on wooden divans in front of their shelves.<ref name=gul18>G\u00fclersoy (1980) p. 18</ref> Each of them occupied a space {{convert|6|to|8|ft|m}} in width, and {{convert|3|to|4|ft|m}} in depth. This was named in Turkish {{lang|tr|dolap}}, meaning 'stall'.<ref name=gul18/> The most precious merchandise was not on display, but kept in cabinets.<ref name=gul18/> Only clothes were hung in long rows, with a picturesque effect. A prospective client could sit in front of the dealer, talk with him and drink a tea or a [[Turkish coffee]], in a relaxed way.<ref name=gul18/> At the end of the day, each stall was closed with drapes. Another peculiarity was the complete lack of advertising.<ref name=gul19>G\u00fclersoy (1980) p. 19</ref> Moreover, as everywhere in the East, traders of the same type of goods were forcibly concentrated along one road, which got its name from their profession.<ref name=gul23>G\u00fclersoy (1980) p. 23</ref> The Inner Bedesten hosted the most precious wares: jewelers, armourers, crystal dealers had their shops there.<ref name=gul23/> The Sandal Bedesten was mainly the center of the [[silk]] trade, but also other goods were on sale there.<ref name=gul29/> The most picturesque parts of the market were \u2013 apart from the two Bedestens \u2013 the shoe market ({{lang-tr|Pabu\u00e7\u00e7ular Pazar\u0131}}), where thousands of shoes of different colors (Ottoman [[sumptuary laws]] prescribed yellow shoes for Muslims, blue for Greek Orthodox, black for Jews and red for Armenians) were on display on high shelves;<ref name=gul33>G\u00fclersoy (1980), p. 33</ref> the spice and [https://turkishaphrodisiacs.com/ herbs market] (later concentrated in the [[Egyptian Bazaar]]), which stood near the jewelers; the armour and weapon market; the old book market; and the flea market.<ref name=gul34>G\u00fclersoy (1980), p. 34</ref>\n\nThis kind of organization disappeared gradually, although nowadays a concentration of the same business along certain roads can be observed again:<ref name=gul37>G\u00fclersoy (1980) p. 37</ref>\n* Jewellers and gold bracelets along ''Kalpak\u00e7\u0131lar Caddesi'';\n* Gold bracelets along ''Kuyumcular \u00c7ar\u015f\u0131s\u0131;\n* Furniture along ''Divrikli Caddesi'';\n* Carpets along ''Sahaflar Caddesi'';\n* Leather goods along ''Perdah\u00e7\u0131lar Caddesi''\n* Leather and casual clothes at the ''Bit Pazar\u0131''.\n\nActually, the main reason of concentrating the trade in one place was to provide the highest security against theft, fire and uprising.<ref name=gul49>G\u00fclersoy (1980) p. 49</ref> The goods in the Bedesten were guaranteed against everything except turmoil.<ref name=gul49/> Gates were always closed at night, and the bazaar was patrolled by guards paid by the merchants' [[guild]]s.<ref name=gul50/> In order to access the complex during night hours, an [[Firman (decree)|imperial edict]] was required.<ref name=gul50>G\u00fclersoy (1980) p. 50</ref> The only official night opening in the history of the Bazaar occurred in 1867 during the feast organized for the return of Sultan [[Abd\u00fclaziz]] from Egypt, when the sovereign crossed the illuminated market riding a horse among the rejoicing populace.<ref name=gul50/><ref>{{cite book|last1=Boyar|first1=Ebru|last2=Fleet|first2=Kate|title=A Social History of Ottoman Istanbul|date=2010|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9781139484442|page=69|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hHd2OizxNCcC&pg=PA70&lpg=PA70&dq=bazaar+Abd%C3%BClaziz+Egypt&source=bl&ots=wsyuubKBES&sig=Af2Mx7dSNaNUaV6eNaGHnwQL1Wo&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwidheiEoqrXAhUGSSYKHYEVBh0Q6AEIUTAK#v=onepage&q=bazaar%20Abd%C3%BClaziz%20Egypt&f=false|accessdate=6 November 2017}}</ref> Despite the immense wealth present in the Bazaar over the centuries\u2014as an English traveller recorded as late as c. 1870, a tour of the inner Bedesten could easily ruin a few [[Rothschild family|Rothschild]] families<ref name=gul38>G\u00fclersoy (1980) p. 38</ref>\u2014theft occurred extremely rarely. The most important such incident happened in 1591, when 30,000 [[Sultani|gold coins]] ({{lang-tr|Alt\u0131n}}) were stolen in the old Bedesten.<ref name=gul61>G\u00fclersoy (1980) p. 61</ref> The theft shocked the whole of Istanbul, the Bazaar remained closed for two weeks and people were tortured, until the money was found hidden under a floor matting.<ref name=gul61/> The culprit was a young [[Iranian peoples|Persian]] [[musk]] seller.

These simple dishes were prepared and served in small two-story [[kiosk]]s placed in the middle of a road.<ref name=gul36/> The most famous among these kiosks is the one\u2014still extant but not functioning any more\u2014placed at the crossing of ''Hal\u0131c\u0131lar Caddesi'' and ''Ac\u0131 \u00c7esme Caddesi''.

In order to establish a new one, it was only necessary to have enough traders of the same good.<ref name=gul47>G\u00fclersoy (1980) p. 47</ref> Afterwards, a monopoly was formed and the number of traders and shops was frozen.<ref name=gul47/> One could only be accepted in the guild through co-optation, either as son of a deceased member, or after paying a suitable sum to a member who wanted to retire.<ref name=gul47/>\n\nThe guild's chief was a public officer called ''[[Keth\u00fcda]]''.

Their members met in [[Dervish]] shrines and performed religious functions.

He is known for his speed on the ball. After leaving Nigeria for Italy at age 16, he has since played for a number of [[List of top-division football clubs in UEFA countries|top-division clubs around Europe]]. He began his senior career in 2002 at [[Serie A]] club [[Inter Milan]], before moving to [[Premier League]] club [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]] in 2006, and then to [[Bundesliga]] club [[VfL Wolfsburg]] in 2009. Having joined [[Russian Premier League]] side Rubin Kazan in July 2010, they [[loan (sports)|loaned]] him to [[Birmingham City F.C.|Birmingham City]] in January 2011.\n\nIn club football, Martins has won the Serie A title, the [[Coppa Italia|Italian Cup]] (twice), and the [[Supercoppa Italiana|Italian Super Cup]], all with Inter. With Birmingham he scored the winning goal in the [[2011 Football League Cup Final]]. He has played [[European football]] with Inter, Newcastle and Wolfsburg, winning the [[UEFA Intertoto Cup]] with Newcastle. His highest scoring league seasons so far have seen him score 11 goals in the [[2004\u201305 Serie A]], and 17 in both the [[2006\u201307 FA Premier League|2006\u201307 Premier League]] and [[2014 Major League Soccer season|2014 MLS]]. In international football, Martins has been in the Nigerian squad for the [[Africa Cup of Nations]] in [[2006 Africa Cup of Nations|2006]], [[2008 Africa Cup of Nations|2008]] and [[2010 Africa Cup of Nations|2010]], and for the [[FIFA World Cup]] in [[2010 FIFA World Cup|2010]]. He played for [[Seattle Sounders FC]] of Major League Soccer from 2013 to 2015, scoring 40 goals, before moving on to China.\n\nMartins had two brothers who also played football professionally. His elder brother, [[Oladipupo Martins]], played for [[A.C. Reggiana 1919|Reggiana]], [[FK Partizan|Partizan]] and [[Innsbrucker AC|Innsbruck]] before retiring from football in 2009 due to heart problems. He died on 8 August 2011 of a suspected heart attack in Lagos, Nigeria.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://socqer.com/questions/839/how-did-nigerias-obafemi-martins-brother-die/ | title = How Did Nigeria's Obafemi Martins' Brother Die? | publisher = Socqer.com | date = 10 August 2011 | accessdate =3 August 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.vanguardngr.com/2011/08/martins%E2%80%99-brother-dies-of-heart-problem/ | title = Martins' Brother Dies of Heart Problem | publisher = Vanguard | date = 9 August 2011 | accessdate =3 August 2012}}</ref> Martins' younger brother is John Ronan Martins.

Ebedei]], having been scouted by manager [[Churchill Oliseh]] while playing on the streets of his hometown. After a year with the club, [[Serie C]] side [[A.C. Reggiana 1919|A.C. Reggiana]] made a move for the player. After a three-month trial, Martins and fellow Ebedei teammate [[Stephen Makinwa]] signed youth contracts with the club in 2000. His first season in Italy saw Martins break into the first team squad, and later in the year [[Serie A]] sides [[Perugia]] and [[Inter Milan]] made offers for the [[forward (football)|forward]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/premier-league/obafemi-martins-leap-of-faith-from-lagos-to-newcastle-462901.html|title=Obafemi Martins: Leap of faith from Lagos to Newcastle|date=25 August 2007|work=The Independent|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5v400bnd5?url=http://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/premier-league/obafemi-martins-leap-of-faith-from-lagos-to-newcastle-462901.html|archivedate=18 December 2010|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n===Inter Milan===\n[[File:17 aprile al meazza (9689231) (cropped).jpg|thumb|left|Martins (right) with Inter Milan in 2005]]\nMartins was signed by Inter Milan in 2001 for a \u20ac750,000 [[transfer fee]],<ref>{{cite web|url=https://110.inter.it/en/obafemi-martins-en/martins-testo3eng/|title=Mister Oba Oba|publisher=inter.it|accessdate=13 October 2018}}</ref> and in his first season he scored 23 goals for the youth team, helping them to win the [[Campionato Nazionale Primavera]] in 2001\u201302 season.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://archiviostorico.gazzetta.it/2002/febbraio/12/festa_tutta_dell_Inter_ga_0_0202121158.shtml|title=La festa \u00e8 tutta dell' Inter|trans-title=The celebration is all for Inter|publisher=La Gazzetta dello Sport|language=Italian|date=12 February 2002|accessdate=13 October 2018}}</ref> His form for the youth side led to his first-team league debut the following season, starting in a match against [[Parma Calcio 1913|Parma]] on 22 December 2002 which was won by Inter 2\u20131.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.calcio.com/cronaca_partita/serie-a-2002-2003-parma-fc-inter/|title=Parma 1:2 Inter|publisher=Calcio.com|language=Italian|date=22 December 2002|accessdate=13 October 2018}}</ref>\n\nMartins didn't become a regular member of the first team squad until the 2002\u201303 season.

With new manager [[Sam Allardyce]] preferring to play [[Michael Owen]] and [[Mark Viduka]] up front, Martins found himself being used as an impact substitute for the first half of the season. Despite this he managed to score consistently, and when Allardyce was sacked and [[Kevin Keegan]] was appointed, Martins found himself being used as part of a three pronged attack along with Owen and Viduka. Martins scored fewer goals in his second season with Newcastle, mainly due to him no longer being the focal point of all their attacks as he was in his first season with them, as well as his season being interrupted with the African Cup of Nations participation with Nigeria in December.\n\nMartins scored six goals in 12 league games during the first half of the 2008\u201309 season before a torn hamstring ruled him out for several games.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.thenorthernecho.co.uk/sport/football/3993745.Martins_missing_for_Magpies_against_Spurs/|title=Martins missing for Magpies against Spurs|date=21 December 2008|accessdate=29 December 2008|newspaper=The Northern Echo | first = Paul | last = Fraser}}</ref> It was confirmed on 7 January 2009, that Martins would undergo hernia surgery in Germany the next Monday.

He helped in the buildup to the second goal and capped off his first appearance in the Bundesliga with a well-taken goal after dribbling past two onrushing defenders and then coolly finishing from six yards out, slotting the ball past the goalkeeper to the far post.\n\n===Rubin Kazan===\nOn 9 July 2010, Martins was sold for a reported \u20ac17&nbsp;million to reigning [[Russian Premier League]] champions [[FC Rubin Kazan|Rubin Kazan]].

He began his career as a youth player at [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] in 1995, turning professional in 1999, but signed for [[Preston North End F.C.|Preston North End]] two years later after a short loan spell. He spent three years with Preston, maintaining a healthy goals to games ratio, before transferring to [[Leeds United F.C.|Leeds United]] in 2004. After three years to Leeds he moved on to [[Fulham F.C.|Fulham]] for a season, before settling at [[Sunderland A.F.C.|Sunderland]] in 2008. He moved north to Scotland to play for [[Rangers F.C.|Rangers]] in January 2011. He helped the club to the [[Scottish Premier League|SPL]] title in 2010\u201311 and also played in the [[2011 Scottish League Cup Final|2011]] [[Scottish League Cup|League Cup]] final victory, before departing at the end of the 2011\u201312 season, when his contract expired. He joined [[Bury F.C.|Bury]] for a one-season spell in August 2012. In addition to these clubs he has also played for [[Port Vale F.C.|Port Vale]], [[Norwich City F.C.|Norwich City]], [[Ipswich Town F.C.|Ipswich Town]], and [[Doncaster Rovers F.C.|Doncaster Rovers]] on loan. He was released by Bury in May 2013, and chose to retire in November 2013 after failing to find a club. Before representing his country at a senior level, he also played for both the [[Northern Ireland national under-21 football team|under-21 team]] and the [[Northern Ireland B national football team|B team]].\n\nHe began his management career with Linfield in October 2015, and led the club to a [[NIFL Premiership]], [[Irish Cup]] and [[County Antrim Shield]] treble in 2016\u201317. The following season proved a disappointment, before they secured the league title and the [[Northern Ireland Football League Cup]] in 2018\u201319.\n\n==Club career==\n\n===Manchester United===\nHealy was born and raised in Killyleagh, Northern Ireland, and played for Crossgar, Lisburn Youth and Down Academy High School in [[Downpatrick]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}} He signed for [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] in August 1999, just four days before his 20th birthday.

In the [[2000\u201301 in English football|following season]] he made a second appearance in the League Cup (as a 90th-minute substitute for [[Luke Chadwick]] in a game that went into extra time, United eventually losing to [[Sunderland A.F.C.|Sunderland]]).

His competitive international d\u00e9but came in September 2000, in a [[FIFA World Cup|World Cup]] qualifying game against [[Malta national football team|Malta]], and he scored his first competitive goal for his country a month later against [[Denmark national football team|Denmark]].\n\nOn 6 June 2004, in a friendly game away to [[Trinidad and Tobago national football team|Trinidad and Tobago]] (his 35th international), he scored his 13th and 14th goals for Northern Ireland, thus equalling and overtaking [[Colin Clarke (footballer, born 1962)|Colin Clarke]]'s record for the country. In September that year, Healy was controversially sent off in Northern Ireland's 2\u20132 draw with [[Wales national football team|Wales]]. After celebrating the goal he scored to put Northern Ireland 2\u20130 up, he made a hand gesture towards the fans.

This made him the highest-ever goalscorer in a [[UEFA European Football Championship|UEFA European Championship]] qualifying campaign. The previous record, of twelve goals in ten games, had been set by [[Davor \u0160uker]] of [[Croatia national football team|Croatia]] in 1996. As a result, Healy was presented with the award by [[Michel Platini]], who quoted: ''\"David Healy's record goes down in history and he beat a world-class striker in Davor Suker to do so. The outstanding performance of David in the qualifying competition of the European Championship and his goal tally of 13 goals is a new record and deserves to be recognised.

He began his career as a youth player at [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] in 1995, turning professional in 1999, but signed for [[Preston North End F.C.|Preston North End]] two years later after a short loan spell. He spent three years with Preston, maintaining a healthy goals to games ratio, before transferring to [[Leeds United F.C.|Leeds United]] in 2004. After three years to Leeds he moved on to [[Fulham F.C.|Fulham]] for a season, before settling at [[Sunderland A.F.C.|Sunderland]] in 2008. He moved north to Scotland to play for [[Rangers F.C.|Rangers]] in January 2011. He helped the club to the [[Scottish Premier League|SPL]] title in 2010\u201311 and also played in the [[2011 Scottish League Cup Final|2011]] [[Scottish League Cup|League Cup]] final victory, before departing at the end of the 2011\u201312 season, when his contract expired. He joined [[Bury F.C.|Bury]] for a one-season spell in August 2012. In addition to these clubs he has also played for [[Port Vale F.C.|Port Vale]], [[Norwich City F.C.|Norwich City]], [[Ipswich Town F.C.|Ipswich Town]], and [[Doncaster Rovers F.C.|Doncaster Rovers]] on loan. He was released by Bury in May 2013, and chose to retire in November 2013 after failing to find a club. Before representing his country at a senior level, he also played for both the [[Northern Ireland national under-21 football team|under-21 team]] and the [[Northern Ireland B national football team|B team]].\n\nHe began his management career with Linfield in October 2015, and led the club to a [[NIFL Premiership]], [[Irish Cup]] and [[County Antrim Shield]] treble in 2016\u201317. The following season proved a disappointment, before they secured the league title and the [[Northern Ireland Football League Cup]] in 2018\u201319.\n\n==Club career==\n\n===Manchester United===\nHealy was born and raised in Killyleagh, Northern Ireland, and played for Crossgar, Lisburn Youth and Down Academy High School in [[Downpatrick]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}} He signed for [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] in August 1999, just four days before his 20th birthday.

In February 2000 he was loaned to [[Port Vale F.C.|Port Vale]], but could only manage three goals in sixteen games for [[Brian Horton]]'s side who were relegated to Division Two. In the [[2000\u201301 in English football|following season]] he made a second appearance in the League Cup (as a 90th-minute substitute for [[Luke Chadwick]] in a game that went into extra time, United eventually losing to [[Sunderland A.F.C.|Sunderland]]). On 23 December 2000, he made his [[Premier League]] debut in the 2\u20130 victory against [[Ipswich Town F.C.|Ipswich Town]] at [[Old Trafford]]; he came on as substitute in the 60th minute and with ten minutes remaining he hit the post denying him a goal.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_prem/1083685.stm |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160306095821/http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/eng_prem/1083685.stm |archivedate=6 March 2016 |title=Solskjaer double crushes Ipswich |work=BBC Sport |publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation |date=23 December 2000 |accessdate=17 April 2020}}</ref> This was his final appearance for United as he signed for [[Football League First Division]] club [[Preston North End F.C.|Preston North End]] six days later, initially on loan, but then a permanent deal was agreed for a \u00a31.5 million fee.<ref name=\"soccerbaseprofile\"/><ref name=\"pnedebut\">{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_div_1/1092722.stm |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160321173511/http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/eng_div_1/1092722.stm |archivedate=21 March 2016 |title=Sheffield United 3-2 Preston |work=BBC Sport |publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation |date=30 December 2000 |accessdate=17 April 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/m/man_utd/1093869.stm |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160306093450/http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/m/man_utd/1093869.stm |archivedate=6 March 2016 |title=Old Trafford's youth exodus |work=BBC Sport |publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation |date=30 December 2000 |accessdate=17 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n===Preston North End===\nHealy made his debut for Preston against [[Sheffield United F.C.|Sheffield United]] on 30 December 2000; he scored after just four minutes in the 3\u22122 loss at [[Bramall Lane]].<ref name=\"pnedebut\"/> In the remainder of the [[2000\u201301 Preston North End F.C. season|2000\u201301]] season, Healy made 26 appearances for Preston and scored 10 goals.

During the management of [[Kevin Blackwell]] Healy found himself regularly being played out of position at Leeds, mainly as a right winger, with Leeds rotating Hulse, [[Richard Cresswell|Cresswell]] and [[Robbie Blake|Blake]] up front.

However, he only scored two further top-flight goals in the season (past [[Reading F.C.|Reading]] and Sunderland), as well as two cup goals past Bolton and [[Bristol Rovers F.C.|Bristol Rovers]].
