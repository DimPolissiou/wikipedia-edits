It is based on the novel by [[James Michael Pratt]] of the same name, previously titled ''The Last Valentine'', a 1998 ''[[New York Times]]'' and ''[[USA Today]]'' bestseller. In December 2011, Betty White received a nomination for the [[Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Female Actor in a Miniseries or Television Movie]] for her performance.\n\n==Plot==\nThe story follows the characters of a TV journalist, Susan Allison (Hewitt), working on a profile of a woman, Caroline Thomas (White), whose husband naval aviator Lt. Neil Thomas was declared [[Missing in action|MIA]] sixty years ago during [[World War II]]. Susan immediately clashes with Caroline's grandson, Lucas Thomas (Faris), when he overhears her referring to the potential story as a fluff piece, rather than the very personal story it is, since she herself doubts if pure and true love exists. She apologizes, and manages to start the interview and starts spending time with both Caroline and Lucas. Her developing friendship with Lucas makes her have doubts about her relationship with her almost fiance, Andrew Hawthorne, a photographer who is frequently absent overseas.\n\nThe interview with Caroline reveals that for sixty-six years she has had no information about her husband from the Department of the Navy. She tells her story about how she and her husband met in 1943, married, and then renovated a house they had bought from her uncle (which is where Caroline still lives). After a year, and despite a child forthcoming, Neil felt he should help his country more than just acting as a training officer, so he went into combat. Their last moments together were at the [[Union Station (Los Angeles)|Union train station]], where she handed him a handmade valentine professing her everlasting love, as he departed on a train. Caroline remained strong, and sent many letters to Neil. On one occasion, Neil replied with a letter containing a small, handmade whittled wooden sculpture of a fighter plane for the baby. After that Caroline stopped receiving letters. Caroline, along with the entire neighborhood, dreaded the times when a Western Union deliveryman arrived in the neighborhood with a yellow telegram, since this meant that someone's loved one was reported to be dead or [[missing in action]]. Eventually, the moment where Caroline received one came, but the telegram stated that her husband was missing in action, so she refused to believe that he was dead. Since then Caroline has returned every year on Valentine's Day to the same train station to wait for him.\n\nWith the help of a United States Senator (Susan did an unrelated story on him) who puts pressure on the Navy, they locate the Billings family, whose now deceased father Jeff was a gunner on Lt. Thomas' airplane. From a surviving letter by Jeff to his wife we hear the account of the crash and of Morang, a Filipino guerilla, who rescued two wounded crash survivors. Susan turns to Andrew for help because he still has connections to the Philippines where Lt. Thomas was last seen alive.\n\nPutting past hard feelings over his breakup with Susan aside, Andrew manages to locate the elderly Morang whilst in the Philippines and sets up a video conference between him and Caroline. The story of the fate of Lt. Thomas, Morang says, is that he was badly wounded, but insisted his more seriously injured gunner, Jeff Billings, be evacuated first. When Lt. Thomas had recovered, he joined the Filipino guerillas and fought the Japanese deep behind enemy lines. During a patrol, Lt. Thomas was killed by a Japanese sniper while selflessly trying to rescue a little boy. Morang reveals he knows where Lt. Thomas's body is buried.\n\nThe U.S. Navy goes to the grave site and returns Lt. Thomas' remains and personal effects to the United States. Caroline is handed Neil's dog-tags, watch, and wallet, which contains her valentine to him, now faded, which he always carried close to his heart. In recognition of Lt. Thomas's bravery, courage, and meritorious service, he is to be posthumously awarded the [[Navy Cross (United States)|Navy Cross]], [[Silver Star]] and [[Purple Heart]]. On Valentine's Day Lt. Thomas's coffin is returned to Caroline at Union Station by the U.S. Navy with full military honors, conducted in front of well-wishers and TV cameras, with a tearful Caroline taking her last goodbyes from her beloved Neil to the sound of [[Taps]]. Caroline is cheered when Lucas and Susan begin a romantic relationship. The film ends with Caroline, who has found peace and closure, seeing that the rosebush Neil had planted long ago in their garden has a new single bloom, the first in a long time, signaling long-lasting love, as she remembers her romantic moments with Neil in the same garden, to the sound of ''[[Dream a Little Dream of Me]]'' playing on the radio.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Jennifer Love Hewitt]] \u2014 Susan Allison\n* [[Betty White]] \u2014 Caroline Robinson Thomas\n** [[Meghann Fahy]] \u2014 Caroline Robinson Thomas (young)\n* [[Sean Faris]] \u2014 Lucas Thomas\n* [[Gil Gerard]] \u2014 Neil Thomas Robinson Jr.\n* [[Billy Magnussen]] \u2014 Neil Thomas\n* [[Will Chase]] \u2014 Andrew Hawthorne\n* [[Nadia Dajani]] \u2014 Julie Oliver\n* [[Robert Pralgo]] \u2014 David Oliver\n* Tom Prusinowski - Navy Chaplain\n* Victoria Loving \u2014 Maggie Thomas, Lucas's mother\n\n==Production==\nThe teleplay was written by [[Maryann Ridini Spencer#References|Maryann Ridini Spencer]] & Barton Taney. Spencer met the author of the book, James Michael Pratt, in 2001 and fell in love with the story line. Her screenplay based on the novel, ultimately resulted in a contract with [[Hallmark]]. Spencer is also co-producer of the project.\n\nThe producers did well in 'matching' young and old Caroline. White and Fahy's facial features, including expressive blue eyes, are similar in most respects, though it would appear Fahy is slightly taller than White.\n\n==Anachronisms==\nThree versions of the song ''Dream a Little Dream of Me'' are heard in the film: sung by the [[Mills Brothers]], as a duet by [[Ella Fitzgerald]] and [[Louis Armstrong]], and by [[Doris Day]]. The first two are 'out of time', as the Mills Brothers and the duet versions were set during the war, when in fact, the Mills Brothers version was recorded in 1964 and the duet in 1950.\n\n==Home media==\nThe film aired on January 30, 2011 on CBS and was available to order from Hallmark after the film aired.\n\n==Reception==\n''The Lost Valentine'' earned mostly positive reviews, with White's performance receiving high praise and great acclaim. The film received a generally positive review from ''[[US Magazine]]'', who said it was \"Supercorny, though White tugs the heart\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.usmagazine.com/moviestvmusic/news/review--the-lost-valentine-2011181 |title=Review \u2013 The Lost Valentine |last=Griffiths |first=John |publisher=Us Magazine |date=January 18, 2011 |accessdate=August 11, 2011}}</ref> Brian Lowry of ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' stated that \"Betty White is easily the best reason to watch The Lost Valentine.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2011/tv/reviews/the-lost-valentine-1117944430/|title=The Lost Valentine|last=Lowry |first=Brian |publisher=Variety |date=January 27, 2011 |accessdate=April 3, 2020}}</ref> Matthew Gilbert of ''[[The Boston Globe]]'' said of White's performance that \"She\u2019s a funny lady for sure, but she can also nicely manage gravitas and vulnerability.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://archive.boston.com/ae/tv/articles/2011/01/28/white_plays_it_straight_in_syrupy_lost_valentine/|title=White plays it straight in syrupy Valentine|last=Gilbert |first=Matthew |publisher=The Boston Globe |date=January 28, 2011 |accessdate=April 3, 2020}}</ref> Jackie Cooper from ''[[HuffPost]]'' said of White \"This movie allows audiences to see her dramatic side and if her grieving widow can\u2019t break your heart, nothing can.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.huffpost.com/entry/the-lost-valentine-betty-_b_814292|title=\u201cThe Lost Valentine\u201d: Betty White Goes All Dramatic On Us|last=Cooper |first=Jackie |publisher=Huffpost |date=January 26, 2011 |accessdate=April 3, 2020}}</ref> And Jim Heinrich of the ''[[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]]'' described White's performance as \"Excellent.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.post-gazette.com/ae/tv-radio/2011/01/27/Two-love-stories-intersect-in-Lost-Valentine/stories/201101270274|title=Two love stories intersect in 'Lost Valentine'|last=Heinrich |first=Jim |publisher=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette |date=January 27, 2011 |accessdate=April 3, 2020}}</ref>\n \nThe film was a huge success which not only won its time period in viewers (14.53 million, beating out Fox's second hour of coverage of the NFL [[Pro Bowl]]) but represented the most-watched Hallmark movie in four years (since the film ''Valley of Light'' aired in January 2007).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.businessweek.com/ap/financialnews/D9L478H00.htm |title=Want TV ratings?

Thomas's body is buried.\n\nThe U.S. Navy goes to the grave site and returns Lt. Thomas' remains and personal effects to the United States. Caroline is handed Neil's dog-tags, watch, and wallet, which contains her valentine to him, now faded, which he always carried close to his heart. In recognition of Lt. Thomas's bravery, courage, and meritorious service, he is to be posthumously awarded the [[Navy Cross (United States)|Navy Cross]], [[Silver Star]] and [[Purple Heart]]. On Valentine's Day Lt. Thomas's coffin is returned to Caroline at Union Station by the U.S. Navy with full military honors, conducted in front of well-wishers and TV cameras, with a tearful Caroline taking her last goodbyes from her beloved Neil to the sound of [[Taps]]. Caroline is cheered when Lucas and Susan begin a romantic relationship. The film ends with Caroline, who has found peace and closure, seeing that the rosebush Neil had planted long ago in their garden has a new single bloom, the first in a long time, signaling long-lasting love, as she remembers her romantic moments with Neil in the same garden, to the sound of ''[[Dream a Little Dream of Me]]'' playing on the radio.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Jennifer Love Hewitt]] \u2014 Susan Allison\n* [[Betty White]] \u2014 Caroline Robinson Thomas\n** [[Meghann Fahy]] \u2014 Caroline Robinson Thomas (young)\n* [[Sean Faris]] \u2014 Lucas Thomas\n* [[Gil Gerard]] \u2014 Neil Thomas Robinson Jr.\n* [[Billy Magnussen]] \u2014 Neil Thomas\n* [[Will Chase]] \u2014 Andrew Hawthorne\n* [[Nadia Dajani]] \u2014 Julie Oliver\n* [[Robert Pralgo]] \u2014 David Oliver\n* Tom Prusinowski - Navy Chaplain\n* Victoria Loving \u2014 Maggie Thomas, Lucas's mother\n\n==Production==\nThe teleplay was written by [[Maryann Ridini Spencer#References|Maryann Ridini Spencer]] & Barton Taney. Spencer met the author of the book, James Michael Pratt, in 2001 and fell in love with the story line. Her screenplay based on the novel, ultimately resulted in a contract with [[Hallmark]]. Spencer is also co-producer of the project.\n\nThe producers did well in 'matching' young and old Caroline. White and Fahy's facial features, including expressive blue eyes, are similar in most respects, though it would appear Fahy is slightly taller than White.\n\n==Anachronisms==\nThree versions of the song ''Dream a Little Dream of Me'' are heard in the film: sung by the [[Mills Brothers]], as a duet by [[Ella Fitzgerald]] and [[Louis Armstrong]], and by [[Doris Day]]. The first two are 'out of time', as the Mills Brothers and the duet versions were set during the war, when in fact, the Mills Brothers version was recorded in 1964 and the duet in 1950.\n\n==Home media==\nThe film aired on January 30, 2011 on CBS and was available to order from Hallmark after the film aired.\n\n==Reception==\n''The Lost Valentine'' earned mostly positive reviews, with White's performance receiving high praise and great acclaim. The film received a generally positive review from ''[[US Magazine]]'', who said it was \"Supercorny, though White tugs the heart\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.usmagazine.com/moviestvmusic/news/review--the-lost-valentine-2011181 |title=Review \u2013 The Lost Valentine |last=Griffiths |first=John |publisher=Us Magazine |date=January 18, 2011 |accessdate=August 11, 2011}}</ref> Brian Lowry of ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' stated that \"Betty White is easily the best reason to watch The Lost Valentine.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2011/tv/reviews/the-lost-valentine-1117944430/|title=The Lost Valentine|last=Lowry |first=Brian |publisher=Variety |date=January 27, 2011 |accessdate=April 3, 2020}}</ref> Matthew Gilbert of ''[[The Boston Globe]]'' said of White's performance that \"She\u2019s a funny lady for sure, but she can also nicely manage gravitas and vulnerability.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://archive.boston.com/ae/tv/articles/2011/01/28/white_plays_it_straight_in_syrupy_lost_valentine/|title=White plays it straight in syrupy Valentine|last=Gilbert |first=Matthew |publisher=The Boston Globe |date=January 28, 2011 |accessdate=April 3, 2020}}</ref> Jackie Cooper from ''[[Huffpost]]'' said of White \"This movie allows audiences to see her dramatic side and if her grieving widow can\u2019t break your heart, nothing can.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.huffpost.com/entry/the-lost-valentine-betty-_b_814292|title=\u201cThe Lost Valentine\u201d: Betty White Goes All Dramatic On Us|last=Cooper |first=Jackie |publisher=Huffpost |date=January 26, 2011 |accessdate=April 3, 2020}}</ref> And Jim Heinrich of the ''[[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]]'' described White's performance as \"Excellent.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.post-gazette.com/ae/tv-radio/2011/01/27/Two-love-stories-intersect-in-Lost-Valentine/stories/201101270274|title=Two love stories intersect in 'Lost Valentine'|last=Heinrich |first=Jim |publisher=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette |date=January 27, 2011 |accessdate=April 3, 2020}}</ref>\n \nThe film was a huge success which not only won its time period in viewers (14.53 million, beating out Fox's second hour of coverage of the NFL [[Pro Bowl]]) but represented the most-watched Hallmark movie in four years (since the film ''Valley of Light'' aired in January 2007).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.businessweek.com/ap/financialnews/D9L478H00.htm |title=Want TV ratings?

Although the two lands bridged in the [[Pleistocene]] subsequently, intervening dry habitat prevented the exchange of wet climate adapted species with wet forests in India. This resulted in southwestern species to evolve and specialize separately, giving rise higher to the higher level of endemism that can be seen today.\n\n==Features==\nSome of the mountain peaks of the central highlands reach above 2500 m, although the average height is 1800 m. [[Knuckles Mountain Range|Knuckles]] rises to 1800 m, with an average elevation of 1500 m.  Because of the elevation, ambient temperature is [[lapse rate|cooler]] than in the lowlands. The mean temperature in this area ranges between 15&nbsp;\u00b0C-20&nbsp;\u00b0C.<ref name=\"forests of sri lanka\"/> In the mornings of the winter months of December to February, ground [[frost]] appears.\n\nThe average annual rainfall ranges from 2000\u20132500&nbsp;mm. The [[Monsoon#Southwest monsoon|southwestern]] monsoon brings most of the rain from May to September, but the [[Monsoon#Northeast monsoon|northeastern]] monsoon contributes a fair amount of rain as well. All of the island's major rivers arise in the central highlands, and montane rain forests act as the main catchment area.\n\n==Flora==\nThe vegetation of this ecoregion is determined by the climate and the [[elevation]]. Montane moist forests vegetation is dominated by ''[[Dipterocarpus]]'' while montane savanna and cloud forests with ''[[Rhododendron]]''. [[Canopy (ecology)|Canopies]] of ''[[Shorea]]-[[Calophyllum]]-[[Syzygium]]'' community can be seen in submontane forests. The [[Understory]] of the higher elevation is dominated by ''[[Strobilanthes]]''. The [[Peak Wilderness Sanctuary|Peak Wilderness]] of all montane rain forests possibly be the only forest area dominated by endemic ''[[Stemonoporus]]'' of family [[Dipterocarpaceae]]. Rhododendron species thrive in the wet montane grasslands known as wet ''pathanas'' in [[Sinhalese language|Sinhalese]]. [[Asian elephant]], who roamed freely in these forests, is now locally extinct.<ref name=\"WWF\" /> Knuckles Range's vegetation  differ from the rest of the central highlands because of the geographical detachment, is having a ''[[Myristica]]-[[Cullenia]]-[[Aglaia]]-[[Litsea]]'' community.\n\n==Biodiversity==\nThe montane forests accommodate more endemic species than the [[Sri Lanka lowland rain forests|lowland rain forests]].<ref name=\"WWF\" /> Half of the country's [[flowering plant]]s and 51 percent of the endemic [[vertebrate]]s are confined to these forests.

All of the island's major rivers arise in the central highlands, and montane rain forests act as the main catchment area.\n\n==Flora==\nThe vegetation of this ecoregion is determined by the climate and the [[elevation]]. Montane moist forests vegetation is dominated by ''[[Dipterocarpus]]'' while montane savanna and cloud forests with ''[[Rhododendron]]''. [[Canopy (ecology)|Canopies]] of ''[[Shorea]]-[[Calophyllum]]-[[Syzygium]]'' community can be seen in submontane forests. The [[Understory]] of the higher elevation is dominated by ''[[Strobilanthes]]''.

The isolated Knuckles range harbours several [[relict]], endemic flora and fauna that are distinct from central massif. More than 34 percent of Sri Lanka's endemic trees, shrubs, and herbs are only found in these forests.\n\n==Fauna==\n\n===Mammals===\nMontane rain forests harbours eight near-endemic mammals, and five are strict endemics.<ref name=\"WWF\" /> Small mammals in Sri Lanka shows a great degree of diversity, such as rodents, shrews and bats.

He is noted for abandoning traditional Egyptian [[polytheism]] and introducing worship centered on the [[Aten]] (notably instead of [[Amun]], the temples of which he destroyed, the name of whom he rubbed off and the priests of whom he left without resources), which is sometimes described as [[monolatristic]], [[henotheistic]], or even quasi-[[monotheism|monotheistic]].

He soon decreed the construction of a temple dedicated to the [[Aten]] in Eastern Karnak. This [[Temple of Amenhotep IV]] was called the Gempaaten (\"The Aten is found in the estate of the Aten\"). The Gempaaten consisted of a series of buildings, including a palace and a structure called the Hwt Benben (named after the [[Benben]] stone) which was dedicated to Queen [[Nefertiti]]. Other Aten temples constructed at Karnak during this time include the [[Temple of Amenhotep IV|Rud-menu]] and the [[Temple of Amenhotep IV|Teni-menu]], which may have been constructed near the Ninth Pylon. During this time he did not repress the worship of Amun, and the [[High Priest of Amun]] was still active in the fourth year of his reign.<ref name=\"Aldred\">Aldred, Cyril (1991).

Yet, even at Amarna itself, some courtiers kept such names as Ahmose (\"child of the moon god\", the owner of tomb 3), and the sculptor's workshop where the famous Nefertiti bust and other works of royal portraiture were found is associated with an artist known to have been called [[Thutmose (sculptor)|Thutmose]] (\"child of Thoth\"). An overwhelmingly large number of [[Egyptian faience|faience]] amulets at Amarna also show that talismans of the household-and-childbirth gods Bes and Taweret, the eye of Horus, and amulets of other traditional deities, were openly worn by its citizens. Indeed, a cache of royal jewelry found buried near the Amarna royal tombs (now in the [[National Museum of Scotland]]) includes a finger ring referring to Mut, the wife of Amun. Such evidence suggests that though Akhenaten shifted funding away from traditional temples, his policies were fairly tolerant until some point, perhaps a particular event as yet unknown, toward the end of the reign.\n\nFollowing Akhenaten's death, change was gradual at first. Within a decade a comprehensive political, religious and artistic reformation began promoting a return of Egyptian life to the norms it had followed during his father's reign. Much of the art and building infrastructure created during Akhenaten's reign was defaced or destroyed in the period following his death, particularly during the reigns of [[Horemheb]] and the early [[19th Dynasty]] kings. Stone building blocks from Akhenaten's construction projects were later used as foundation stones for subsequent rulers' temples and tombs.\n{{clear}}\n\n==Pharaoh and family depictions==\n{{further|Amarna art}}\n[[File:Limestone statuette of Akhenaten, Nefertiti, and a princess.

In some cases, representations are more naturalistic, especially in depictions of animals and plants, of commoners, and in a sense of action and movement for both non-royal and royal people. However, depictions of members of the court, especially members of the royal family, are extremely stylized, with elongated heads, protruding stomachs, heavy hips, thin arms and legs, and exaggerated facial features.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.nationalgeographic.com/magazine/2017/05/akhenaten-revolutionary-egypt-king-art-architecture/?sf72336685=1|title=The Age of Akhenaten|date=2017-04-20|access-date=2017-04-24}}</ref> Significantly, and for the only time in the history of Egyptian royal art, Akhenaten's family are shown taking part in decidedly naturalistic activities, showing affection for each other, and being caught in mid-action (in traditional art, a pharaoh's divine nature was expressed by repose, even immobility). The depictions of action may correspond to the emphasis on the active, creative nurturing of the Aten emphasized in the \"Great Hymn to the Aten\" and elsewhere.\n[[File:Akhenaten with blue crown.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Small statue of Akhenaten wearing the Egyptian Blue Crown of War]]\n\nNefertiti also appears, both beside the king and alone (or with her daughters), in actions usually reserved for a pharaoh, suggesting that she enjoyed unusual status for a queen. Early artistic representations of her tend to be indistinguishable from her husband's except by her regalia, but soon after the move to the new capital, Nefertiti begins to be depicted with features specific to her. Questions remain whether the beauty of Nefertiti is portraiture or idealism.\n\nWhy representations of Akhenaten depict him in a bizarre, strikingly androgynous way, remains a vigorously debated question. Religious reasons have been suggested, such as to emulate the creative nature of the Aten, who is called in Amarna tomb texts \"mother and father\" of all that is. Or, it has been suggested, Akhenaten's (and his family's) portraiture exaggerates his distinctive physical traits. Until Akhenaten's mummy is positively identified, such theories remain speculative. Some scholars do identify Mummy 61074, found in KV55, an unfinished tomb in the Valley of the Kings, as Akhenaten's.<ref>S. McAvoy, \"Mummy 61074: a Strange Case of Mistaken Identity\", ''[[Antiguo Oriente]]'' 5 (2007): 183\u201394.</ref> If so, or if the KV 55 mummy is that of his close relative, [[Smenkhkare]], its measurements tend to support the theory that Akhenaten's depictions exaggerate his actual appearance. Though the mummy consists only of disarticulated bones, the skull is long and has a prominent chin, and the limbs are light and long. In 2007, [[Zahi Hawass]] and a team of researchers made CT Scan images of Mummy 61074. They have concluded that the elongated skull, cheek bones, cleft palate, and impacted wisdom tooth suggest that the mummy is the father of Tutankhamun, and thus is Akhenaten.\n\n[[File:The Wilbour Plaque, ca. 1352-1336 B.C.E., 16.48.jpg|thumbnail|right|The Wilbour Plaque, {{circa|1352\u20131336 BCE}}, [[Brooklyn Museum]] This relief depicts Akhenaten and Nefertiti late in their reign.]]\n\n===Family and relations===\n{{See also|Family tree of the Eighteenth Dynasty of Egypt}}\n[[File:Brown quartzite inlay head of Akhenaten or Nefertiti.

The Petrie Museum of Egyptian Archaeology, London]]\nIt has been proposed that Akhenaten may have taken some of his daughters as sexual consorts, to attempt to father a male heir by them, but this is very debatable. It does seem certain that like his father, Amenhotep III, Akhenaten named at least one daughter as [[Great Royal Wife]], but this does not necessarily indicate she was his sexual consort as the position was also an important ceremonial position.<ref>Robins, G.; ''Women in Ancient Egypt'', [[Harvard University Press]] (1993) pp. 21\u201327</ref>\n* Meritaten is recorded as Great Royal Wife to Smenkhkare in the tomb of Meryre II in Akhet-Aten. She is also listed alongside King Akhenaten and King Neferneferuaten as Great Royal Wife on a box from the tomb of Tutankhamen. Letters written to Akhenaten from foreign rulers make reference to Meritaten as 'mistress of the house'.\n* Meketaten, Akhenaten's second daughter. Meketaten's death, at perhaps the age of 10 to 12, is recorded in the royal tombs of Amarna about the year 13 or 14. Her death was attributed to possibly from childbirth, because of a depiction of an infant with her. Because no husband is known for Meketaten, the assumption has been that Akhenaten was the father. The inscription giving the filiation of the child is damaged, thereby preventing resolution of the issue; alternate explanations proposed have been that Meketaten died of plague, or that the child is a portrayal of Meketaten's ka (soul).\n* Various monuments, originally for Kiya, were reinscribed for Akhenaten's daughters Meritaten and Ankhesenpaaten; the revised inscriptions list a Meritaten-tasherit (\"junior\") and an Ankhesenpaaten-tasherit. Some view this to indicate that Akhenaten fathered his own grandchildren. Others hold that, since these grandchildren are not attested to elsewhere, they are fictions invented to fill the space originally filled by Kiya's child.<ref>Aidan Dodson & Dyan Hilton, ''The Complete Royal Families of Ancient Egypt'', Thames & Hudson (2004), p. 154</ref>\n\nTwo other lovers have been suggested, but are not widely accepted:\n* Smenkhkare, Akhenaten's successor and/or co-ruler for the last years of his reign. Rather than a lover, however, Smenkhkare is likely to have been a half-brother or a son to Akhenaten. Some have even suggested that Smenkhkare was actually an alias of Nefertiti or Kiya, and therefore one of Akhenaten's wives (see below).\n* Tiye, his mother. Twelve years after the death of Amenhotep III, she is still mentioned in inscriptions as queen and beloved of the king, but kings' mothers often were. The few supporters of this theory (notably [[Immanuel Velikovsky]]) consider Akhenaten to be the historical model of legendary King [[Oedipus]] of [[Thebes, Greece]] and Tiye the model for his mother/wife [[Jocasta]].\n\n==International relations==\n[[File:ReliefPortraitOfAkhenaten01.png|thumb|right|Akhenaten in the typical Amarna period style.]]\n[[File:Painted limestone miniature stela.

The Petrie Museum of Egyptian Archaeology, London]]\nThe [[Amarna Letters]], a cache of diplomatic correspondence discovered in modern times at el-Amarna (the modern designation of the site of [[Akhetaten]]), have provided important evidence about Akhenaten's reign and foreign policy. This correspondence comprises a priceless collection of incoming messages on clay tablets sent to Akhetaten from various subject rulers through Egyptian military outposts and from the foreign rulers (recognized as \"Great Kings\") of the kingdom of [[Mitanni]], of Babylon, of Assyria, and of Hatti. The governors and kings of Egypt's subject domains also wrote frequently to plead for gold from the pharaoh, and also complained that he had snubbed and cheated them.\n\nEarly in his reign, Akhenaten had conflicts with [[Tushratta]], the king of Mitanni, who had courted favor with his father against the Hittites. Tushratta complains in numerous letters that Akhenaten had sent him gold-plated statues rather than statues made of solid gold; the statues formed part of the bride-price which Tushratta received for letting his daughter [[Tadukhepa]] marry Amenhotep III and then later marry Akhenaten. Amarna letter EA 27 preserves a complaint by Tushratta to Akhenaten about the situation:\n\n<blockquote>\n\"I...asked your father [[Amenhotep III|Mimmureya]] for statues of solid cast gold, one of myself and a second statue, a statue of Tadu-Heba [Tadukhepa], my daughter, and your father said, 'Don't talk of giving statues just of solid cast gold. I will give you ones made also of lapis lazuli. I will give you too, along with the statues, much additional gold and [other] goods beyond measure.' Every one of my messengers that were staying in Egypt saw the gold for the statues with their own eyes. Your father himself recast the statues [i]n the presence of my messengers, and he made them entirely of pure gold...He showed much additional gold, which was beyond measure and which he was sending to me. He said to my messengers, 'See with your own eyes, here the statues, there much gold and goods beyond measure, which I am sending to my brother.' And my messengers did see with their own eyes! But my brother [i.e., Akhenaten] has not sent the solid [gold] statues that your father was going to send. You have sent plated ones of wood. Nor have you sent me the goods that your father was going to send me, but you have reduced [them] greatly. Yet there is nothing I know of in which I have failed my brother. Any day that I hear the greetings of my brother, that day I make a festive occasion... May my brother send me much gold. [At] the kim[ru fe]ast...[...with] many goods [may my] brother honor me. In my brother's country gold is as plentiful as dust. May my brother cause me no distress. May he send me much gold in order that my brother [with the gold and m]any [good]s may honor me.\" (EA 27)<ref>Moran (1992), pp. 87\u201389</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\n[[File:PortraitStudyOfAkhenaten-ThutmoseWorkshop EgyptianMuseumBerlin.png|thumb|upright|Plaster portrait study of a pharaoh, Ahkenaten or a co-regent or successor. Discovered within the workshop of the royal sculptor Thutmose at Amarna, now part of the [[Egyptian Museum of Berlin|\u00c4gyptisches Museum collection in Berlin]].]]\n\nWhile Akhenaten was certainly not a close friend of Tushratta, he was evidently concerned at the expanding power of the [[Hittites|Hittite]] Empire under its powerful ruler [[Suppiluliuma I]]. A successful Hittite attack on Mitanni and its ruler Tushratta would have disrupted the entire international balance of power in the Ancient Middle East at a time when Egypt had made peace with Mitanni; this would cause some of Egypt's vassals to switch their allegiances to the Hittites, as time would prove. A group of Egypt's allies who attempted to rebel against the Hittites were captured, and wrote letters begging Akhenaten for troops, but he did not respond to most of their pleas. Evidence suggests that the troubles on the northern frontier led to difficulties in [[Canaan]], particularly in a struggle for power between [[Labaya]] of [[Shechem]] and [[Abdi-Heba]] of [[Jerusalem]], which required the pharaoh to intervene in the area by dispatching [[Medjay]] troops northwards. Akhenaten pointedly refused to save his vassal [[Rib-Hadda]] of [[Byblos]] \u2013 whose kingdom was being besieged by the expanding state of [[Amurru kingdom|Amurru]] under [[Abdi-Ashirta]] and later [[Aziru]], son of Abdi-Ashirta \u2013 despite Rib-Hadda's numerous pleas for help from the pharaoh. Rib-Hadda wrote a total of 60 letters to Akhenaten pleading for aid from the pharaoh. Akhenaten wearied of Rib-Hadda's constant correspondences and once told Rib-Hadda: \"You are the one that writes to me more than all the (other) mayors\" or Egyptian vassals in EA 124.<ref>Moran (1992), p. 203</ref> What Rib-Hadda did not comprehend was that the Egyptian king would not organize and dispatch an entire army north just to preserve the political status quo of several minor city states on the fringes of Egypt's Asiatic Empire.<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://www.saudiaramcoworld.com/issue/199906/correspondence.in.clay.htm |title=Akhenaten and Rib Hadda from Byblos |journal=Saudi Aramco World |volume=50 |issue=6 |date=November\u2013December 1999 |first=Barbara |last=Ross |pages=30\u201335 |access-date=2013-08-08 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100113125402/http://saudiaramcoworld.com/issue/199906/correspondence.in.clay.htm |archive-date=2010-01-13 |url-status = dead|df= }}</ref> Rib-Hadda would pay the ultimate price; his exile from Byblos due to a coup led by his brother [[Ili-Rapih|Ilirabih]] is mentioned in one letter.

Moran]]<ref>Moran, (William L.) The Amarna Letters, [[Johns Hopkins University Press]], 1992. p.xxvi</ref> notes that the Amarna corpus of 380+ letters counters the conventional view that Akhenaten neglected Egypt's foreign territories in favour of his internal reforms. Several letters from Egyptian vassals notify the pharaoh that they have followed his instructions:\n\n<blockquote>To the king, my lord, my god, my Sun, the Sun from the sky: Message of Yapahu, the ruler of [[Gezer|Gazru]], your servant, the dirt at your feet. I indeed prostrate myself at the feet of the king, my lord, my god, my Sun...7 times and 7 times, on the stomach and on the back. I am indeed guarding the place of the king, my lord, the Sun of the sky, where I am, and all the things the king, my lord, has written me, I am indeed carrying out \u2013 everything!

There is much silver, and I will give it to you. Indeed there is an abundance of everything, but not with me [here].\" Thus did the ruler [Rib-Hadda] speak to you. Did you not write to the king, my lord saying, \"I am your servant like all the previous mayors [i.e., vassals] in his city\"? Yet you acted delinquently by taking the mayor whose brother had cast him away at the gate, from his city.\n</blockquote>\n\n[[File:Amenhotep.jpg|thumb|upright|left|<center>Head of Akhenaten</center>]]\n\n<blockquote>\nHe [Rib-Hadda] was residing in [[Sidon]] and, following your own judgment, you gave him to [some] mayors. Were you ignorant of the treacherousness of the men? If you really are the king's servant, why did you not denounce him before the king, your lord, saying, \"This mayor has written to me saying, 'Take me to yourself and get me into my city'\"? And if you did act loyally, still all the things you wrote were not true. In fact, the king has reflected on them as follows, \"Everything you have said is not friendly.\"\n\nNow the king has heard as follows, \"You are at peace with the ruler of Qidsa. ([[Kadesh (Syria)|Kadesh]]) The two of you take food and strong drink together.\" And it is true. Why do you act so? Why are you at peace with a ruler whom the king is fighting? And even if you did act loyally, you considered your own judgment, and his judgment did not count. You have paid no attention to the things that you did earlier. What happened to you among them that you are not on the side of the king, your lord? Consider the people that are training you for their own advantage. They want to throw you into the fire...If for any reason whatsoever you prefer to do evil, and if you plot evil, treacherous things, then you, together with your entire family, shall die by the axe of the king. So perform your service for the king, your lord, and you will live. You yourself know that the king does not fail when he rages against all of Canaan. And when you wrote saying, 'May the king, my Lord, give me leave this year, and then I will go next year to the king, my Lord [i.e., to Egypt]. If this is impossible, I will send my son in my place' \u2013 the king, your lord, let you off this year in accordance with what you said. Come yourself, or send your son [now], and you will see the king at whose sight all lands live. (EA 162)<ref>Moran (1992), pp. 248\u201349</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nThis letter shows that Akhenaten paid close attention to the affairs of his vassals in Canaan and Syria. Akhenaten commanded Aziru to come to Egypt and proceeded to detain him there for at least one year.

Only the Egyptian border province of [[Amurru kingdom|Amurru]] in Syria around the Orontes river was permanently lost to the Hittites when its ruler Aziru defected to the Hittites. Finally, contrary to the conventional view of a ruler who neglected Egypt's international relations, Akhenaten is known to have initiated at least one campaign into [[Nubia]] in his regnal Year 12, where his campaign is mentioned in Amada stela CG 41806 and on a separate companion stela at [[Buhen]].<ref>Schulman (1982), pp. 299\u2013316</ref>\n\n==Death, burial and succession==\n{{Further|Amarna succession}}\n[[File:Sarcophage Akh\u00e9naton.JPG|thumb|left|Akhenaten's [[sarcophagus]] reconstituted from pieces discovered in his original tomb in [[Amarna]], now in the [[Egyptian Museum]], Cairo.]]\nThe last dated appearance of Akhenaten and the Amarna family is in the [[tomb of Meryra II]], and dates from second month, year 12 of his reign.<ref>Allen (2006), p. 1</ref> After this the historical record is unclear, and only with the succession of [[Tutankhamun]] is somewhat clarified.\n\n[[File:KV55 sarcophagus (Cairo Museum).jpg|thumb|upright|The desecrated royal coffin of Akhenaten found in Tomb KV55]]\n\nIn December 2012, it was announced that a '''Year 16 III [[Season of the Inundation|Akhet]] day 15''' inscription dated explicitly to Akhenaten's reign which mentions, in the same breath, the presence of a living Queen Nefertiti, was found in a limestone quarry at [[Deir el-Bersha]] just north of Amarna.<ref>Athena Van der Perre, \"Nofretetes (vorerst) letzte dokumentierte Erw\u00e4hnung,\" in: Im Licht von Amarna \u2013 100 Jahre Fund der Nofretete.

Tutankhaten changed his name to Tutankhamun in Year 2 of his reign (1332 BCE) and abandoned the city of Akhetaten, which eventually fell into ruin. His successors Ay and [[Horemheb]] disassembled temples Akhenaten had built, including the temple at Thebes, using them as a source of easily available building materials and decorations for their own temples.\n\nFinally, Akhenaten, Neferneferuaten, Smenkhkare, Tutankhamun, and Ay were excised from the official lists of pharaohs, which instead reported that Amenhotep III was immediately succeeded by Horemheb. This is thought to be part of an attempt by Horemheb to delete all trace of Atenism and the pharaohs associated with it from the historical record.<ref>Joshua J.

Initially, he permitted worship of Egypt's traditional deities to continue but near the [[Temple of Karnak]] (Amun-Ra's great cult center), he erected several massive buildings including temples to the [[Aten]]. Aten was usually depicted as a sun disk with rays extending with long arms and tiny human hands at each end.<ref>Molefi Kete Asante and Ama Mazama, ''Encyclopedia of African Religion'' (Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage Publications, 2009)</ref>\nThese buildings at Thebes were later dismantled by his successors and used as infill for new constructions in the Temple of Karnak; when they were later dismantled by archaeologists, some 36,000 decorated blocks from the original Aton building here were revealed which preserve many elements of the original relief scenes and inscriptions.<ref name=\"rosalie125\">David (1998), p. 125</ref>\n\n[[File:Akhenaten as a Sphinx (Kestner Museum).jpg|thumb|left|<center>Akhenaten depicted as a [[sphinx]] at [[Amarna]].</center>]]\nIn Year 5 of his reign, Amenhotep IV took decisive steps to establish the Aten as the sole god of Egypt: the pharaoh \"disbanded the priesthoods of all the other gods...and diverted the income from these [other] cults to support the Aten\". To emphasize his complete allegiance to the [[Aten]], the king officially changed his name from Amenhotep IV to Akhenaten or 'Living Spirit of Aten.'<ref name=\"rosalie125\"/> Akhenaten's fifth year also marked the beginning of construction on his new capital, [[Akhetaten]] or 'Horizon of Aten', at the site known today as [[Amarna]]. Very soon afterwards, he centralized Egyptian religious practices in Akhetaten, though construction of the city seems to have continued for several more years. In honor of Aten, Akhenaten also oversaw the construction of some of the most massive temple complexes in ancient Egypt. In these new temples, Aten was worshipped in the open sunlight rather than in dark temple enclosures as had been the previous custom. Akhenaten is also believed to have composed the [[Great Hymn to the Aten]].\n[[File:Inscribed limestone fragment showing early Aten cartouches, \"the Living Ra Horakhty\". Reign of Akhenaten.

However, by Year 9 of his reign, Akhenaten declared that Aten was not merely the supreme god, but the only worshipable god, and that he, Akhenaten, was the only intermediary between Aten and his people. He ordered the defacing of Amun's temples throughout Egypt and, in a number of instances, inscriptions of the plural 'gods' were also removed.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}\n[[File:Siliceous limestone fragment of a statue.

The Petrie Museum of Egyptian Archaeology, London]]\nAten's name also is written differently after Year 9 to emphasize the radicalism of the new regime, which included a ban on [[Cult image|images]], with the exception of a rayed solar disc, in which the rays (commonly depicted ending in hands) appear to represent the unseen spirit of Aten, who by then was evidently considered not merely a sun god, but rather a universal deity. Representations of the Aten were always accompanied with a sort of hieroglyphic footnote, stating that the representation of the sun as all-encompassing creator was to be taken as just that: a representation of something that, by its very nature as something transcending creation, cannot be fully or adequately represented by any one part of that creation.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}\n\nArchaeological discoveries at Akhetaten show that many ordinary residents of this city chose to gouge or chisel out all references to the god Amun on even minor personal items that they owned, such as commemorative scarabs or make-up pots, perhaps for fear of being accused of having Amunist sympathies. References to Amenhotep III, Akhenaten's father, were partly erased since they contained the traditional Amun form of his name: Nebmaatre Amunhotep.<ref name=\"Nicholas Reeves 2001, pp. 154\u201355\">Nicholas Reeves, Akhenaten: Egypt's False Prophet, Thames & Hudson, 2001, pp. 154\u201355</ref>\n\nAs the Egytologist Nicholas Reeves writes:\n<blockquote>Such displays of frightening self-censorship and toadying loyalty are ominous indicators of the paranoia which was beginning to grip the country. Not only were the streets [of Akhetaten] filled with the pharaoh's soldiers; it seems the population now had to contend with the danger of malicious informers.<ref name=\"Nicholas Reeves 2001, pp. 154\u201355\"/></blockquote>\n\nIn the end, Akhenaten's revolution collapsed from within after his death since the massive costs of founding a new capital city at El-Amarna and the closing of the Amun temples choked off the growth of the Egyptian economy. A notable result of Akhenaten's centralisation tendencies was the appearance of large-scale corruption among the king's state officials who held unprecedented control over all the wealth and produce of Egypt. This was a tendency that the last 18th Dynasty pharaoh [[Horemheb]] was compelled to deal with by threatening to cut off the nose of any officials who were found to be involved in state corruption or abuses in a major stela erected near the 10th pylon of [[Karnak]].<ref>[http://www.reshafim.org.il/ad/egypt/texts/edict_of_horemheb.htm \"The Great Edict of Horemheb\"] by J.

The neglect of local government increased the problems of maintaining an effective administration and introduced a whole new [state] system characterized by corruption and arbitrariness... The construction of the new capital [at Akhetaten] and new temples was to the detriment of the economy in general and the temple-based economy in particular: the system of divine estates was, from a centralizing viewpoint, harmful, but its abandonment in the Amarna period led to the ruination of a whole [economic] system of production and distribution without providing any new structure to replace it.<ref>Nicolas Grimal, ''A History of Ancient Egypt'', 1992 English edition, Blackwell Publishers Ltd., p. 232</ref></blockquote>\n\n==Speculative theories==\n[[File:Akhenaten trial piece.jpg|thumb|left|Sculptor's trial piece of Akhenaten.]]\nAkhenaten's status as a religious revolutionary has led to much [[speculative reason|speculation]], ranging from scholarly hypotheses to non-academic [[fringe science|fringe]] theories.

Cambridge, Massachusetts: Harvard University Press; pp. 23\u201324, fn. 2.</ref>\n\nIt is widely accepted that there are strong stylistic similarities between Akhenaten's [[Great Hymn to the Aten]] and the [[Book of Psalms|Biblical Psalm]] [[Psalm 104|104]], though this form of writing was widespread in ancient Near Eastern hymnology both before and after the period.\n\nOthers have likened some aspects of Akhenaten's relationship with the Aten to the relationship, in Christian tradition, between [[Jesus|Jesus Christ]] and God, particularly interpretations that emphasize a more monotheistic interpretation of Atenism than a henotheistic one. [[Donald B. Redford]] has noted that some have viewed Akhenaten as a harbinger of Jesus. \"After all, Akhenaten did call himself the son of the sole god: 'Thine only son that came forth from thy body'.\"<ref name=\"redford\">\"The Monotheism of the Heretic Pharaoh: Precursor of Mosaic monotheism or Egyptian anomaly?\", [[Donald B.

''Akhenaten and the religion of light'', p. 14, [[Cornell University Press]], {{ISBN|978-0-8014-8725-5}}</ref>\n\nRedford argued that while Akhenaten called himself the son of the Sun-Disc and acted as the chief mediator between god and creation, kings had claimed the same relationship and priestly role for thousands of years before Akhenaten's time. However Akhenaten's case may be different through the emphasis which he placed on the heavenly father and son relationship. Akhenaten described himself as being \"thy son who came forth from thy limbs\", \"thy child\", \"the eternal son that came forth from the Sun-Disc\", and \"thine only son that came forth from thy body\". The close relationship between father and son is such that only the king truly knows the heart of \"his father\", and in return his father listens to his son's prayers. He is his father's image on earth, and as Akhenaten is king on earth, his father is king in heaven. As high priest, prophet, king and divine he claimed the central position in the new religious system. Because only he knew his father's mind and will, Akhenaten alone could interpret that will for all mankind with true teaching coming only from him.<ref name=\"redford\"/>\n\nRedford concluded:\n<blockquote>Before much of the archaeological evidence from Thebes and from Tell el-Amarna became available, wishful thinking sometimes turned Akhenaten into a humane teacher of the true God, a mentor of Moses, a christlike figure, a philosopher before his time. But these imaginary creatures are now fading away as the historical reality gradually emerges. There is little or no evidence to support the notion that Akhenaten was a progenitor of the full-blown monotheism that we find in the Bible. The monotheism of the Hebrew Bible and the New Testament had its own separate development \u2013 one that began more than half a millennium after the pharaoh's death.<ref>\"Aspects of Monotheism\", Donald B.

However, as an autosomal recessive disease, it seems to fit better into Akhenaten's family tree \u2013 Akhenaten's parents, Amenhotep III and Tiye, were probably healthy, and Marfan Syndrome was ruled out following DNA tests on Tutankhamun in 2010.<ref name=\"Schemm, PaulAssociated Press 3\"/>\n\nHowever, [[Dominic Montserrat]] in ''Akhenaten: History, Fantasy and Ancient Egypt'' states that \"there is now a broad consensus among Egyptologists that the exaggerated forms of Akhenaten's physical portrayal... are not to be read literally\".<ref name = \"mont\"/> Montserrat and others<ref>Reeves, Nicholas (2005) \"Akhenaten: Egypt's False Prophet\" (Thames and Hudson)</ref> argue that the body-shape relates to some form of religious symbolism. Because the god Aten was referred to as \"the mother and father of all humankind\" it has been suggested that Akhenaten was made to look [[androgynous]] in artwork as a symbol of the androgyny of the god. This required \"a symbolic gathering of all the attributes of the creator god into the physical body of the king himself\", which will \"display on earth the Aten's multiple life-giving functions\".<ref name = \"mont\"/> Akhenaten did refer to himself as \"The Unique One of Re\", and he may have used his control of artistic expression to distance himself from the common people, though such a radical departure from the idealized traditional representation of the image of the pharaoh would be truly extraordinary.\n\n<!-- A \u2013 A 'fat' AIII or old Nefertiti are not \"unrealistically stylized\" if they are in fact fat or old.  Quite the contrary, it seems like Living In Truth.\nB \u2013 I don't know of any depictions of him without headgear of some sort to support the \"Furthermore...\" portion without any citations (OR/NPOV) or clarification.\nC \u2013 Note sure how A supports B, or how they relate at all.\n\nRepresentations of other persons than Akhenaten in the 'Amarna style' are equally unrealistically stylized \u2013 for example, a carving of his father Amenhotep III as an overweight figure;<ref>Johnson (1998), p. 91</ref> Nefertiti is shown in some statues as well past her prime, with a severe face and a stomach swollen by repeated pregnancies.\nFurthermore, we also possess many representations of Akhenaten where he is portrayed with a very rounded and not unusually shaped head{{Citation needed|date=March 2017}}. Therefore, we should not presume the exaggerated images to be accurate, whilst failing to note the many realistic portrayals.\n-->\nAnother unfounded claim was made by [[Immanuel Velikovsky]], who hypothesized an incestuous relationship with his mother, Tiye. Velikovsky also posited that Akhenaten had swollen legs. Based on this, he identified Akhenaten as the history behind the [[Oedipus]] myth, Oedipus being Greek for \"swollen feet\", and moved the setting from the [[Greek Thebes]] to the [[Egyptian Thebes]]. As part of his argument, Velikovsky uses the fact that Akhenaten viciously carried out a campaign to erase the name of his father, which he argues could have developed into Oedipus killing his father.<ref>Immanuel Velikovsky, ''Oedipus and Akhnaton, Myth and History'', Doubleday, 1960.</ref>\n\nIn 2012, Hutan Ashrafian, a surgeon at [[Imperial College London]], published research into the early death of Akhenaten and the premature deaths of other 18th Dynasty pharaohs (including Tutankhamun and Thutmose IV). He identifies that their early deaths were probably a result of a [[temporal lobe epilepsy|Familial Temporal Epilepsy]]. This would account for the untimely death of Akhenaten, his abnormal endocrine body shape on sculptures and can also explain Akhenaten's religious conviction due to this type of epilepsy's association with intense spiritual visions and religiosity.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Ashrafian |first=Hutan |title=Familial epilepsy in the pharaohs of ancient Egypt's 18th Dynasty |journal=Epilepsy & Behavior |volume=25 |issue=1 |date=September 2012 |pages=23\u201331 |doi=10.1016/j.yebeh.2012.06.014 |pmid=22980077}}</ref> However, because there is currently no definitive genetic test for epilepsy, the theory remains impossible to prove.<ref>Locker, Melissa.

In the 1970s, John Harris identified the figure pictured alongside Akhenaten as Nefertiti, arguing that she may have actually been elevated to coregent and perhaps even succeeded temporarily as an independent ruler, changing her name to Smenkhkare.<ref name = \"mont\"/>\n\nNicholas Reeves and other Egyptologists contend that Smenkhkare was the same person as [[Neferneferuaten]], who ruled together with Akhenaten as coregent for the final one or two years of Akhenaten's reign.

He is noted for abandoning traditional Egyptian [[polytheism]] and introducing worship centered on the [[Aten]] (notably instead of [[Amun]], the temples of which he destroyed, the name of whom he rubbed off and the priests of whom he left without resources), which is sometimes described as [[monolatristic]], [[henotheistic]], or even quasi-[[monotheism|monotheistic]].

Current literature by Eric Cline, Nicholas Reeves, [[Peter Dorman]] and other scholars comes out strongly against the establishment of a long coregency between the two rulers and in favour of either no coregency or a brief one lasting one to two years at the most.<ref>Reeves (2000) p. 77</ref> Other literature by [[Donald Redford]], William Murnane, [[Alan Gardiner]] and more recently by Lawrence Berman in 1998 contests the view of any coregency whatsoever between Akhenaten and his father.<ref>Berman (1998) p. 23</ref>\n\nIn February 2014, the Egyptian Ministry for Antiquities announced what it called conclusive evidence that Akhenaten shared power with his father for at least 8 years.

He decorated the southern entrance to the precincts of the [[Egyptian temple|temple]] of [[Amun-Re]] with scenes of his worshiping [[Re-Harakhti]]. He soon decreed the construction of a temple dedicated to the [[Aten]] in Eastern Karnak. This [[Temple of Amenhotep IV]] was called the Gempaaten (\"The Aten is found in the estate of the Aten\"). The Gempaaten consisted of a series of buildings, including a palace and a structure called the Hwt Benben (named after the [[Benben]] stone) which was dedicated to Queen [[Nefertiti]]. Other Aten temples constructed at Karnak during this time include the [[Temple of Amenhotep IV|Rud-menu]] and the [[Temple of Amenhotep IV|Teni-menu]], which may have been constructed near the Ninth Pylon. During this time he did not repress the worship of Amun, and the [[High Priest of Amun]] was still active in the fourth year of his reign.<ref name=\"Aldred\">Aldred, Cyril (1991).

Yet, even at Amarna itself, some courtiers kept such names as Ahmose (\"child of the moon god\", the owner of tomb 3), and the sculptor's workshop where the famous Nefertiti bust and other works of royal portraiture were found is associated with an artist known to have been called [[Thutmose (sculptor)|Thutmose]] (\"child of Thoth\"). An overwhelmingly large number of [[Egyptian faience|faience]] amulets at Amarna also show that talismans of the household-and-childbirth gods Bes and Taweret, the eye of Horus, and amulets of other traditional deities, were openly worn by its citizens. Indeed, a cache of royal jewelry found buried near the Amarna royal tombs (now in the [[National Museum of Scotland]]) includes a finger ring referring to Mut, the wife of Amun. Such evidence suggests that though Akhenaten shifted funding away from traditional temples, his policies were fairly tolerant until some point, perhaps a particular event as yet unknown, toward the end of the reign.\n\nFollowing Akhenaten's death, change was gradual at first. Within a decade a comprehensive political, religious and artistic reformation began promoting a return of Egyptian life to the norms it had followed during his father's reign. Much of the art and building infrastructure created during Akhenaten's reign was defaced or destroyed in the period following his death, particularly during the reigns of [[Horemheb]] and the early [[19th Dynasty]] kings. Stone building blocks from Akhenaten's construction projects were later used as foundation stones for subsequent rulers' temples and tombs.\n{{clear}}\n\n==Pharaoh and family depictions==\n{{further|Amarna art}}\n[[File:Limestone statuette of Akhenaten, Nefertiti, and a princess.

In some cases, representations are more naturalistic, especially in depictions of animals and plants, of commoners, and in a sense of action and movement for both non-royal and royal people. However, depictions of members of the court, especially members of the royal family, are extremely stylized, with elongated heads, protruding stomachs, heavy hips, thin arms and legs, and exaggerated facial features.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.nationalgeographic.com/magazine/2017/05/akhenaten-revolutionary-egypt-king-art-architecture/?sf72336685=1|title=The Age of Akhenaten|date=2017-04-20|access-date=2017-04-24}}</ref> Significantly, and for the only time in the history of Egyptian royal art, Akhenaten's family are shown taking part in decidedly naturalistic activities, showing affection for each other, and being caught in mid-action (in traditional art, a pharaoh's divine nature was expressed by repose, even immobility). The depictions of action may correspond to the emphasis on the active, creative nurturing of the Aten emphasized in the \"Great Hymn to the Aten\" and elsewhere.\n[[File:Akhenaten with blue crown.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Small statue of Akhenaten wearing the Egyptian Blue Crown of War]]\n\nNefertiti also appears, both beside the king and alone (or with her daughters), in actions usually reserved for a pharaoh, suggesting that she enjoyed unusual status for a queen. Early artistic representations of her tend to be indistinguishable from her husband's except by her regalia, but soon after the move to the new capital, Nefertiti begins to be depicted with features specific to her. Questions remain whether the beauty of Nefertiti is portraiture or idealism.\n\nWhy representations of Akhenaten depict him in a bizarre, strikingly androgynous way, remains a vigorously debated question. Religious reasons have been suggested, such as to emulate the creative nature of the Aten, who is called in Amarna tomb texts \"mother and father\" of all that is. Or, it has been suggested, Akhenaten's (and his family's) portraiture exaggerates his distinctive physical traits. Until Akhenaten's mummy is positively identified, such theories remain speculative. Some scholars do identify Mummy 61074, found in KV55, an unfinished tomb in the Valley of the Kings, as Akhenaten's.<ref>S. McAvoy, \"Mummy 61074: a Strange Case of Mistaken Identity\", ''[[Antiguo Oriente]]'' 5 (2007): 183\u201394.</ref> If so, or if the KV 55 mummy is that of his close relative, [[Smenkhkare]], its measurements tend to support the theory that Akhenaten's depictions exaggerate his actual appearance. Though the mummy consists only of disarticulated bones, the skull is long and has a prominent chin, and the limbs are light and long. In 2007, [[Zahi Hawass]] and a team of researchers made CT Scan images of Mummy 61074. They have concluded that the elongated skull, cheek bones, cleft palate, and impacted wisdom tooth suggest that the mummy is the father of Tutankhamun, and thus is Akhenaten.\n\n[[File:The Wilbour Plaque, ca. 1352-1336 B.C.E., 16.48.jpg|thumbnail|right|The Wilbour Plaque, {{circa|1352\u20131336 BCE}}, [[Brooklyn Museum]] This relief depicts Akhenaten and Nefertiti late in their reign.]]\n\n===Family and relations===\n{{See also|Family tree of the Eighteenth Dynasty of Egypt}}\n[[File:Brown quartzite inlay head of Akhenaten or Nefertiti.

It does seem certain that like his father, Amenhotep III, Akhenaten named at least one daughter as [[Great Royal Wife]], but this does not necessarily indicate she was his sexual consort as the position was also an important ceremonial position.<ref>Robins, G.; ''Women in Ancient Egypt'', [[Harvard University Press]] (1993) pp. 21\u201327</ref>\n* Meritaten is recorded as Great Royal Wife to Smenkhkare in the tomb of Meryre II in Akhet-Aten. She is also listed alongside King Akhenaten and King Neferneferuaten as Great Royal Wife on a box from the tomb of Tutankhamen. Letters written to Akhenaten from foreign rulers make reference to Meritaten as 'mistress of the house'.\n* Meketaten, Akhenaten's second daughter. Meketaten's death, at perhaps the age of 10 to 12, is recorded in the royal tombs of Amarna about the year 13 or 14. Her death was attributed to possibly from childbirth, because of a depiction of an infant with her. Because no husband is known for Meketaten, the assumption has been that Akhenaten was the father. The inscription giving the filiation of the child is damaged, thereby preventing resolution of the issue; alternate explanations proposed have been that Meketaten died of plague, or that the child is a portrayal of Meketaten's ka (soul).\n* Various monuments, originally for Kiya, were reinscribed for Akhenaten's daughters Meritaten and Ankhesenpaaten; the revised inscriptions list a Meritaten-tasherit (\"junior\") and an Ankhesenpaaten-tasherit. Some view this to indicate that Akhenaten fathered his own grandchildren. Others hold that, since these grandchildren are not attested to elsewhere, they are fictions invented to fill the space originally filled by Kiya's child.<ref>Aidan Dodson & Dyan Hilton, ''The Complete Royal Families of Ancient Egypt'', Thames & Hudson (2004), p. 154</ref>\n\nTwo other lovers have been suggested, but are not widely accepted:\n* Smenkhkare, Akhenaten's successor and/or co-ruler for the last years of his reign. Rather than a lover, however, Smenkhkare is likely to have been a half-brother or a son to Akhenaten. Some have even suggested that Smenkhkare was actually an alias of Nefertiti or Kiya, and therefore one of Akhenaten's wives (see below).\n* Tiye, his mother. Twelve years after the death of Amenhotep III, she is still mentioned in inscriptions as queen and beloved of the king, but kings' mothers often were. The few supporters of this theory (notably [[Immanuel Velikovsky]]) consider Akhenaten to be the historical model of legendary King [[Oedipus]] of [[Thebes, Greece]] and Tiye the model for his mother/wife [[Jocasta]].\n\n==International relations==\n[[File:ReliefPortraitOfAkhenaten01.png|thumb|right|Akhenaten in the typical Amarna period style.]]\n[[File:Painted limestone miniature stela.

The Petrie Museum of Egyptian Archaeology, London]]\nThe [[Amarna Letters]], a cache of diplomatic correspondence discovered in modern times at el-Amarna (the modern designation of the site of [[Akhetaten]]), have provided important evidence about Akhenaten's reign and foreign policy. This correspondence comprises a priceless collection of incoming messages on clay tablets sent to Akhetaten from various subject rulers through Egyptian military outposts and from the foreign rulers (recognized as \"Great Kings\") of the kingdom of [[Mitanni]], of Babylon, of Assyria, and of Hatti. The governors and kings of Egypt's subject domains also wrote frequently to plead for gold from the pharaoh, and also complained that he had snubbed and cheated them.\n\nEarly in his reign, Akhenaten had conflicts with [[Tushratta]], the king of Mitanni, who had courted favor with his father against the Hittites. Tushratta complains in numerous letters that Akhenaten had sent him gold-plated statues rather than statues made of solid gold; the statues formed part of the bride-price which Tushratta received for letting his daughter [[Tadukhepa]] marry Amenhotep III and then later marry Akhenaten. Amarna letter EA 27 preserves a complaint by Tushratta to Akhenaten about the situation:\n\n<blockquote>\n\"I...asked your father [[Amenhotep III|Mimmureya]] for statues of solid cast gold, one of myself and a second statue, a statue of Tadu-Heba [Tadukhepa], my daughter, and your father said, 'Don't talk of giving statues just of solid cast gold. I will give you ones made also of lapis lazuli. I will give you too, along with the statues, much additional gold and [other] goods beyond measure.' Every one of my messengers that were staying in Egypt saw the gold for the statues with their own eyes. Your father himself recast the statues [i]n the presence of my messengers, and he made them entirely of pure gold...He showed much additional gold, which was beyond measure and which he was sending to me. He said to my messengers, 'See with your own eyes, here the statues, there much gold and goods beyond measure, which I am sending to my brother.' And my messengers did see with their own eyes! But my brother [i.e., Akhenaten] has not sent the solid [gold] statues that your father was going to send. You have sent plated ones of wood. Nor have you sent me the goods that your father was going to send me, but you have reduced [them] greatly. Yet there is nothing I know of in which I have failed my brother. Any day that I hear the greetings of my brother, that day I make a festive occasion... May my brother send me much gold. [At] the kim[ru fe]ast...[...with] many goods [may my] brother honor me. In my brother's country gold is as plentiful as dust. May my brother cause me no distress. May he send me much gold in order that my brother [with the gold and m]any [good]s may honor me.\" (EA 27)<ref>Moran (1992), pp. 87\u201389</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\n[[File:PortraitStudyOfAkhenaten-ThutmoseWorkshop EgyptianMuseumBerlin.png|thumb|upright|Plaster portrait study of a pharaoh, Ahkenaten or a co-regent or successor.

A successful Hittite attack on Mitanni and its ruler Tushratta would have disrupted the entire international balance of power in the Ancient Middle East at a time when Egypt had made peace with Mitanni; this would cause some of Egypt's vassals to switch their allegiances to the Hittites, as time would prove. A group of Egypt's allies who attempted to rebel against the Hittites were captured, and wrote letters begging Akhenaten for troops, but he did not respond to most of their pleas. Evidence suggests that the troubles on the northern frontier led to difficulties in [[Canaan]], particularly in a struggle for power between [[Labaya]] of [[Shechem]] and [[Abdi-Heba]] of [[Jerusalem]], which required the pharaoh to intervene in the area by dispatching [[Medjay]] troops northwards. Akhenaten pointedly refused to save his vassal [[Rib-Hadda]] of [[Byblos]] \u2013 whose kingdom was being besieged by the expanding state of [[Amurru kingdom|Amurru]] under [[Abdi-Ashirta]] and later [[Aziru]], son of Abdi-Ashirta \u2013 despite Rib-Hadda's numerous pleas for help from the pharaoh. Rib-Hadda wrote a total of 60 letters to Akhenaten pleading for aid from the pharaoh. Akhenaten wearied of Rib-Hadda's constant correspondences and once told Rib-Hadda: \"You are the one that writes to me more than all the (other) mayors\" or Egyptian vassals in EA 124.<ref>Moran (1992), p. 203</ref> What Rib-Hadda did not comprehend was that the Egyptian king would not organize and dispatch an entire army north just to preserve the political status quo of several minor city states on the fringes of Egypt's Asiatic Empire.<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://www.saudiaramcoworld.com/issue/199906/correspondence.in.clay.htm |title=Akhenaten and Rib Hadda from Byblos |journal=Saudi Aramco World |volume=50 |issue=6 |date=November\u2013December 1999 |first=Barbara |last=Ross |pages=30\u201335 |access-date=2013-08-08 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100113125402/http://saudiaramcoworld.com/issue/199906/correspondence.in.clay.htm |archive-date=2010-01-13 |url-status = dead|df= }}</ref> Rib-Hadda would pay the ultimate price; his exile from Byblos due to a coup led by his brother [[Ili-Rapih|Ilirabih]] is mentioned in one letter. When Rib-Hadda appealed in vain for aid from Akhenaten and then turned to Aziru, his sworn enemy, to place him back on the throne of his city, Aziru promptly had him dispatched to the king of Sidon, where Rib-Hadda was almost certainly executed.<ref name=\"bryce186\">Bryce (1998), p. 186</ref>\n\n[[William L. Moran]]<ref>Moran, (William L.) The Amarna Letters, [[Johns Hopkins University Press]], 1992. p.xxvi</ref> notes that the Amarna corpus of 380+ letters counters the conventional view that Akhenaten neglected Egypt's foreign territories in favour of his internal reforms. Several letters from Egyptian vassals notify the pharaoh that they have followed his instructions:\n\n<blockquote>To the king, my lord, my god, my Sun, the Sun from the sky: Message of Yapahu, the ruler of [[Gezer|Gazru]], your servant, the dirt at your feet. I indeed prostrate myself at the feet of the king, my lord, my god, my Sun...7 times and 7 times, on the stomach and on the back. I am indeed guarding the place of the king, my lord, the Sun of the sky, where I am, and all the things the king, my lord, has written me, I am indeed carrying out \u2013 everything! Who am I, a dog, and what is my house... and what is anything I have, that the orders of the king, my lord, the Sun from the sky, should not obey constantly?'' (EA 378)<ref>Moran (2003) pp. 368-69</ref></blockquote>\n\nWhen the loyal but unfortunate Rib-Hadda was killed at the instigation of Aziru,<ref name=\"bryce186\"/> Akhenaten sent an angry letter to Aziru containing a barely veiled accusation of outright treachery on the latter's part.<ref>Moran (1992), pp. 248\u201350</ref> Akhenaten wrote:\n\n<blockquote>\nSay to Aziru, ruler of Amurru: Thus the king, your lord [Akhenaten], saying: The ruler of Gubla [Byblos], whose brother had cast him away at the gate, said to you, \"Take me and get me into the city. There is much silver, and I will give it to you. Indeed there is an abundance of everything, but not with me [here].\" Thus did the ruler [Rib-Hadda] speak to you. Did you not write to the king, my lord saying, \"I am your servant like all the previous mayors [i.e., vassals] in his city\"? Yet you acted delinquently by taking the mayor whose brother had cast him away at the gate, from his city.\n</blockquote>\n\n[[File:Amenhotep.jpg|thumb|upright|left|<center>Head of Akhenaten</center>]]\n\n<blockquote>\nHe [Rib-Hadda] was residing in [[Sidon]] and, following your own judgment, you gave him to [some] mayors. Were you ignorant of the treacherousness of the men? If you really are the king's servant, why did you not denounce him before the king, your lord, saying, \"This mayor has written to me saying, 'Take me to yourself and get me into my city'\"? And if you did act loyally, still all the things you wrote were not true. In fact, the king has reflected on them as follows, \"Everything you have said is not friendly.\"\n\nNow the king has heard as follows, \"You are at peace with the ruler of Qidsa. ([[Kadesh (Syria)|Kadesh]]) The two of you take food and strong drink together.\" And it is true. Why do you act so? Why are you at peace with a ruler whom the king is fighting? And even if you did act loyally, you considered your own judgment, and his judgment did not count. You have paid no attention to the things that you did earlier. What happened to you among them that you are not on the side of the king, your lord? Consider the people that are training you for their own advantage. They want to throw you into the fire...If for any reason whatsoever you prefer to do evil, and if you plot evil, treacherous things, then you, together with your entire family, shall die by the axe of the king. So perform your service for the king, your lord, and you will live. You yourself know that the king does not fail when he rages against all of Canaan. And when you wrote saying, 'May the king, my Lord, give me leave this year, and then I will go next year to the king, my Lord [i.e., to Egypt]. If this is impossible, I will send my son in my place' \u2013 the king, your lord, let you off this year in accordance with what you said. Come yourself, or send your son [now], and you will see the king at whose sight all lands live. (EA 162)<ref>Moran (1992), pp. 248\u201349</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nThis letter shows that Akhenaten paid close attention to the affairs of his vassals in Canaan and Syria. Akhenaten commanded Aziru to come to Egypt and proceeded to detain him there for at least one year. In the end, Akhenaten was forced to release Aziru back to his homeland when the Hittites advanced southwards into [[Amqu|Amki]], thereby threatening Egypt's series of Asiatic vassal states, including Amurru.<ref>Bryce (1998), p. 188</ref> Sometime after his return to Amurru, Aziru defected to the Hittite side with his kingdom.<ref>Bryce (1998), pp. 189</ref> While it is known from an Amarna letter by Rib-Hadda that the Hittites \"seized all the countries that were vassals of the king of Mitanni\" (EA 75)<ref>Moran (1992), p. 145</ref> Akhenaten managed to preserve Egypt's control over the core of her Near Eastern Empire (which consisted of present-day Israel as well as the Phoenician coast) while avoiding conflict with the increasingly powerful Hittite Empire of [[Suppiluliuma I]]. Only the Egyptian border province of [[Amurru kingdom|Amurru]] in Syria around the Orontes river was permanently lost to the Hittites when its ruler Aziru defected to the Hittites. Finally, contrary to the conventional view of a ruler who neglected Egypt's international relations, Akhenaten is known to have initiated at least one campaign into [[Nubia]] in his regnal Year 12, where his campaign is mentioned in Amada stela CG 41806 and on a separate companion stela at [[Buhen]].<ref>Schulman (1982), pp. 299\u2013316</ref>\n\n==Death, burial and succession==\n{{Further|Amarna succession}}\n[[File:Sarcophage Akh\u00e9naton.JPG|thumb|left|Akhenaten's [[sarcophagus]] reconstituted from pieces discovered in his original tomb in [[Amarna]], now in the [[Egyptian Museum]], Cairo.]]\nThe last dated appearance of Akhenaten and the Amarna family is in the [[tomb of Meryra II]], and dates from second month, year 12 of his reign.<ref>Allen (2006), p. 1</ref> After this the historical record is unclear, and only with the succession of [[Tutankhamun]] is somewhat clarified.\n\n[[File:KV55 sarcophagus (Cairo Museum).jpg|thumb|upright|The desecrated royal coffin of Akhenaten found in Tomb KV55]]\n\nIn December 2012, it was announced that a '''Year 16 III [[Season of the Inundation|Akhet]] day 15''' inscription dated explicitly to Akhenaten's reign which mentions, in the same breath, the presence of a living Queen Nefertiti, was found in a limestone quarry at [[Deir el-Bersha]] just north of Amarna.<ref>Athena Van der Perre, \"Nofretetes (vorerst) letzte dokumentierte Erw\u00e4hnung,\" in: Im Licht von Amarna \u2013 100 Jahre Fund der Nofretete.

Tutankhaten changed his name to Tutankhamun in Year 2 of his reign (1332 BCE) and abandoned the city of Akhetaten, which eventually fell into ruin. His successors Ay and [[Horemheb]] disassembled temples Akhenaten had built, including the temple at Thebes, using them as a source of easily available building materials and decorations for their own temples.\n\nFinally, Akhenaten, Neferneferuaten, Smenkhkare, Tutankhamun, and Ay were excised from the official lists of pharaohs, which instead reported that Amenhotep III was immediately succeeded by Horemheb. This is thought to be part of an attempt by Horemheb to delete all trace of Atenism and the pharaohs associated with it from the historical record.<ref>Joshua J.

Initially, he permitted worship of Egypt's traditional deities to continue but near the [[Temple of Karnak]] (Amun-Ra's great cult center), he erected several massive buildings including temples to the [[Aten]].

To emphasize his complete allegiance to the [[Aten]], the king officially changed his name from Amenhotep IV to Akhenaten or 'Living Spirit of Aten.'<ref name=\"rosalie125\"/> Akhenaten's fifth year also marked the beginning of construction on his new capital, [[Akhetaten]] or 'Horizon of Aten', at the site known today as [[Amarna]]. Very soon afterwards, he centralized Egyptian religious practices in Akhetaten, though construction of the city seems to have continued for several more years. In honor of Aten, Akhenaten also oversaw the construction of some of the most massive temple complexes in ancient Egypt. In these new temples, Aten was worshipped in the open sunlight rather than in dark temple enclosures as had been the previous custom. Akhenaten is also believed to have composed the [[Great Hymn to the Aten]].\n[[File:Inscribed limestone fragment showing early Aten cartouches, \"the Living Ra Horakhty\". Reign of Akhenaten.

However, by Year 9 of his reign, Akhenaten declared that Aten was not merely the supreme god, but the only worshipable god, and that he, Akhenaten, was the only intermediary between Aten and his people. He ordered the defacing of Amun's temples throughout Egypt and, in a number of instances, inscriptions of the plural 'gods' were also removed.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}\n[[File:Siliceous limestone fragment of a statue.

The Petrie Museum of Egyptian Archaeology, London]]\nAten's name also is written differently after Year 9 to emphasize the radicalism of the new regime, which included a ban on [[Cult image|images]], with the exception of a rayed solar disc, in which the rays (commonly depicted ending in hands) appear to represent the unseen spirit of Aten, who by then was evidently considered not merely a sun god, but rather a universal deity. Representations of the Aten were always accompanied with a sort of hieroglyphic footnote, stating that the representation of the sun as all-encompassing creator was to be taken as just that: a representation of something that, by its very nature as something transcending creation, cannot be fully or adequately represented by any one part of that creation.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}\n\nArchaeological discoveries at Akhetaten show that many ordinary residents of this city chose to gouge or chisel out all references to the god Amun on even minor personal items that they owned, such as commemorative scarabs or make-up pots, perhaps for fear of being accused of having Amunist sympathies. References to Amenhotep III, Akhenaten's father, were partly erased since they contained the traditional Amun form of his name: Nebmaatre Amunhotep.<ref name=\"Nicholas Reeves 2001, pp. 154\u201355\">Nicholas Reeves, Akhenaten: Egypt's False Prophet, Thames & Hudson, 2001, pp. 154\u201355</ref>\n\nAs the Egytologist Nicholas Reeves writes:\n<blockquote>Such displays of frightening self-censorship and toadying loyalty are ominous indicators of the paranoia which was beginning to grip the country. Not only were the streets [of Akhetaten] filled with the pharaoh's soldiers; it seems the population now had to contend with the danger of malicious informers.<ref name=\"Nicholas Reeves 2001, pp. 154\u201355\"/></blockquote>\n\nIn the end, Akhenaten's revolution collapsed from within after his death since the massive costs of founding a new capital city at El-Amarna and the closing of the Amun temples choked off the growth of the Egyptian economy. A notable result of Akhenaten's centralisation tendencies was the appearance of large-scale corruption among the king's state officials who held unprecedented control over all the wealth and produce of Egypt. This was a tendency that the last 18th Dynasty pharaoh [[Horemheb]] was compelled to deal with by threatening to cut off the nose of any officials who were found to be involved in state corruption or abuses in a major stela erected near the 10th pylon of [[Karnak]].<ref>[http://www.reshafim.org.il/ad/egypt/texts/edict_of_horemheb.htm \"The Great Edict of Horemheb\"] by J.

The neglect of local government increased the problems of maintaining an effective administration and introduced a whole new [state] system characterized by corruption and arbitrariness... The construction of the new capital [at Akhetaten] and new temples was to the detriment of the economy in general and the temple-based economy in particular: the system of divine estates was, from a centralizing viewpoint, harmful, but its abandonment in the Amarna period led to the ruination of a whole [economic] system of production and distribution without providing any new structure to replace it.<ref>Nicolas Grimal, ''A History of Ancient Egypt'', 1992 English edition, Blackwell Publishers Ltd., p. 232</ref></blockquote>\n\n==Speculative theories==\n[[File:Akhenaten trial piece.jpg|thumb|left|Sculptor's trial piece of Akhenaten.]]\nAkhenaten's status as a religious revolutionary has led to much [[speculative reason|speculation]], ranging from scholarly hypotheses to non-academic [[fringe science|fringe]] theories. Although some believe the religion he introduced was mostly monotheistic, many others see Akhenaten as a practitioner of an Aten [[monolatry]],<ref>Dominic Montserrat (2000).

Cambridge, Massachusetts: Harvard University Press; pp. 23\u201324, fn. 2.</ref>\n\nIt is widely accepted that there are strong stylistic similarities between Akhenaten's [[Great Hymn to the Aten]] and the [[Book of Psalms|Biblical Psalm]] [[Psalm 104|104]], though this form of writing was widespread in ancient Near Eastern hymnology both before and after the period.\n\nOthers have likened some aspects of Akhenaten's relationship with the Aten to the relationship, in Christian tradition, between [[Jesus|Jesus Christ]] and God, particularly interpretations that emphasize a more monotheistic interpretation of Atenism than a henotheistic one. [[Donald B. Redford]] has noted that some have viewed Akhenaten as a harbinger of Jesus. \"After all, Akhenaten did call himself the son of the sole god: 'Thine only son that came forth from thy body'.\"<ref name=\"redford\">\"The Monotheism of the Heretic Pharaoh: Precursor of Mosaic monotheism or Egyptian anomaly?\", [[Donald B.

''Akhenaten and the religion of light'', p. 14, [[Cornell University Press]], {{ISBN|978-0-8014-8725-5}}</ref>\n\nRedford argued that while Akhenaten called himself the son of the Sun-Disc and acted as the chief mediator between god and creation, kings had claimed the same relationship and priestly role for thousands of years before Akhenaten's time. However Akhenaten's case may be different through the emphasis which he placed on the heavenly father and son relationship. Akhenaten described himself as being \"thy son who came forth from thy limbs\", \"thy child\", \"the eternal son that came forth from the Sun-Disc\", and \"thine only son that came forth from thy body\". The close relationship between father and son is such that only the king truly knows the heart of \"his father\", and in return his father listens to his son's prayers. He is his father's image on earth, and as Akhenaten is king on earth, his father is king in heaven. As high priest, prophet, king and divine he claimed the central position in the new religious system. Because only he knew his father's mind and will, Akhenaten alone could interpret that will for all mankind with true teaching coming only from him.<ref name=\"redford\"/>\n\nRedford concluded:\n<blockquote>Before much of the archaeological evidence from Thebes and from Tell el-Amarna became available, wishful thinking sometimes turned Akhenaten into a humane teacher of the true God, a mentor of Moses, a christlike figure, a philosopher before his time. But these imaginary creatures are now fading away as the historical reality gradually emerges. There is little or no evidence to support the notion that Akhenaten was a progenitor of the full-blown monotheism that we find in the Bible. The monotheism of the Hebrew Bible and the New Testament had its own separate development \u2013 one that began more than half a millennium after the pharaoh's death.<ref>\"Aspects of Monotheism\", Donald B.

However, this is unlikely because this disorder results in [[Infertility|sterility]] and Akhenaten is known to have fathered numerous children. These children are repeatedly portrayed through years of archaeological and iconographic evidence \u2013 at least six daughters by Queen Nefertiti, well known as the King and Queen's six princesses of Amarna, as well as his successor [[Tutankhamun]] by a minor wife.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}\n\nAnother suggestion by Burridge<ref>Burridge, A., (1995) \"Did Akhenaten Suffer From Marfan's Syndrome?\" (Akhenaten Temple Project Newsletter No. 3, September 1995)</ref> is that Akhenaten may have suffered from Marfan's Syndrome. [[Marfan's syndrome]], unlike Froelich's, does not result in any lack of intelligence or sterility. It is associated with a sunken chest, long curved spider-like fingers ([[arachnodactyly]]), occasional congenital heart difficulties, a high curved or slightly cleft palate, and a highly curved cornea or dislocated lens of the eye, with the requirement for bright light to see well. Marfan's sufferers tend towards being taller than average, with a long, thin face, and elongated skull, overgrown ribs, a funnel or pigeon chest, and larger pelvis, with enlarged thighs and spindly calves.<ref>{{Cite web|author =Megaera Lorenz |url=http://www.heptune.com/Marfans.html |title=Lorenz, Maegara \"The Mystery of Akhenaton: Genetics or Aesthetics\" |publisher=Heptune.com |date= |accessdate=2010-03-21| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100208110136/http://www.heptune.com/Marfans.html| archivedate= 8 February 2010|url-status = live}}</ref> Marfan's syndrome is a dominant characteristic, and sufferers have a 50% chance of passing it on to their children.<ref>[http://www.library.nhs.uk/ChildHealth/ViewResource.aspx?resID=126262 Marfan Syndrome]{{Dead link|date=February 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} UK [[National Health Service]] [http://archaeologynews.multiply.com/journal/item/257 \"Did Akhenaton Suffer from Marfan's Syndrome\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110714131806/http://archaeologynews.multiply.com/journal/item/257 |date=2011-07-14 }}</ref> All of these symptoms arguably sometimes appear in depictions of Akhenaten and of his children.

Because the god Aten was referred to as \"the mother and father of all humankind\" it has been suggested that Akhenaten was made to look [[androgynous]] in artwork as a symbol of the androgyny of the god. This required \"a symbolic gathering of all the attributes of the creator god into the physical body of the king himself\", which will \"display on earth the Aten's multiple life-giving functions\".<ref name = \"mont\"/> Akhenaten did refer to himself as \"The Unique One of Re\", and he may have used his control of artistic expression to distance himself from the common people, though such a radical departure from the idealized traditional representation of the image of the pharaoh would be truly extraordinary.\n\n<!-- A \u2013 A 'fat' AIII or old Nefertiti are not \"unrealistically stylized\" if they are in fact fat or old.

Therefore, we should not presume the exaggerated images to be accurate, whilst failing to note the many realistic portrayals.\n-->\nAnother unfounded claim was made by [[Immanuel Velikovsky]], who hypothesized an incestuous relationship with his mother, Tiye. Velikovsky also posited that Akhenaten had swollen legs. Based on this, he identified Akhenaten as the history behind the [[Oedipus]] myth, Oedipus being Greek for \"swollen feet\", and moved the setting from the [[Greek Thebes]] to the [[Egyptian Thebes]]. As part of his argument, Velikovsky uses the fact that Akhenaten viciously carried out a campaign to erase the name of his father, which he argues could have developed into Oedipus killing his father.<ref>Immanuel Velikovsky, ''Oedipus and Akhnaton, Myth and History'', Doubleday, 1960.</ref>\n\nIn 2012, Hutan Ashrafian, a surgeon at [[Imperial College London]], published research into the early death of Akhenaten and the premature deaths of other 18th Dynasty pharaohs (including Tutankhamun and Thutmose IV). He identifies that their early deaths were probably a result of a [[temporal lobe epilepsy|Familial Temporal Epilepsy]]. This would account for the untimely death of Akhenaten, his abnormal endocrine body shape on sculptures and can also explain Akhenaten's religious conviction due to this type of epilepsy's association with intense spiritual visions and religiosity.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Ashrafian |first=Hutan |title=Familial epilepsy in the pharaohs of ancient Egypt's 18th Dynasty |journal=Epilepsy & Behavior |volume=25 |issue=1 |date=September 2012 |pages=23\u201331 |doi=10.1016/j.yebeh.2012.06.014 |pmid=22980077}}</ref> However, because there is currently no definitive genetic test for epilepsy, the theory remains impossible to prove.<ref>Locker, Melissa.

It was released on [[Steam (service)|Steam]] for [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] and [[macOS]] on December 15, 2014. Early alpha and beta versions were browser-based and [[free-to-play]]. On October 14, 2018, the game was released for mobile [[iOS]] and [[Android (operating system)|Android]] platforms after a successful and long-supported [[Kickstarter]] fundraiser. On July 24, 2019, a beta [[Unity (game engine)|Unity]] port for the Steam version of the game became available. The free-to-play, [[Adobe Flash Player|Flash]] browser version is still available but no longer supported since 2020, as the developers focus on porting the game to Unity. ''Town of Salem'' is reportedly the largest online version of the classic social deduction party game [[Mafia (party game)|''Werewolf'']].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.gamasutra.com/view/pressreleases/299329/Indie_Smash_Hit_Town_of_Salem_Gets_New_Expansion_The%0ACoven.php|title=Indie Smash Hit Town of Salem Gets New Expansion: The Coven|website=www.gamasutra.com|language=en|access-date=2020-03-22}}</ref> It has a player base of over 8 million.<ref>{{cite web |title=Popular Online Game, Town of Salem, Hit with Massive Data Breach |url=https://evolvemga.com/town-of-salem/ |website=Evolve MGA |accessdate=23 March 2020}}</ref>\n\n== Gameplay ==\nThe game is inspired by the party games ''Werewolf'' and ''[[Mafia (party game)|Mafia]]'', in which players adopt different roles belonging to different teams, of an informed minority and uninformed majority, aiming to eliminate each other for control of the village or town. As the name implies, the game takes place in the historical town of [[Salem, Massachusetts|Salem]], [[Massachusetts]], alluding to the infamous [[Salem witch trials|witch-hunt trials]] that killed innocent townspeople due to paranoia and superstition. The chief strategy of the game is to survive and accomplish win conditions. Players use a combination of role abilities, teamwork, communication, deduction and deception to achieve victory.\n\nThe game features 49 unique roles, including ones from the ''The Coven'' expansion pack.<ref name=\"the gamer 2019\">{{cite web |last1=Pellow |first1=Nichole |title=Town of Salem: 5 Best Roles To Play (& 5 Worst) |url=https://www.thegamer.com/town-of-salem-best-worst-roles/ |website=The Gamer |accessdate=23 March 2020}}</ref> Seven game modes and one custom mode are available on the vanilla. The bespoke modes are Classic, Ranked Practice, Ranked, Rapid, All Any, Rainbow and Dracula's Palace. They are modes that have pre-selected roles for the match. Custom mode allows the host of the match to choose the roles available. All modes except Custom and Rapid require 15 players. Seven is the minimum number of players for Custom and Rapid modes. Once the match begins, the players will create their name for the match. If they did not type in a name, the game will automatically select a default name for them. Default names are based on the real-life figures of the Salem witch trials. After that, the game will designate each player a role according to an algorithm.<ref name=\"game skinny\" /> \n\nIn the vanilla game, there are three alignments: Town, Mafia and Neutral.<ref name=\"the gamer 2019\" /> Town and Mafia are two teams with their own win conditions. The win condition for Town is to \"lynch every criminal and evildoer.\" For Mafia it's to \"kill anyone that will not submit to the Mafia.\"<ref>{{cite web |title=Roles |url=https://www.blankmediagames.com/roles/ |website=BlankMediaGames |accessdate=22 March 2020}}</ref> Town players are uninformed, meaning they do not know the roles of other players. Mafia players are informed, meaning they know who other Mafia players are, but they do not know the roles of non-Mafia players. Using their role abilities and deduction, players discover the roles of other players to facilitate their victory. Town and Mafia can only win the game if the opposing team(s) perishes entirely.\n\nNeutrals have individual win conditions that must be achieved on their own. When a Neutral player dies without completing their win condition, they can no longer win the game even if another Neutral player completes their win condition. Some Neutral roles may survive and win with either Town or Mafia, as long as their win condition is completed. Neutral Killing roles, specifically, can only win when Town and Mafia are eliminated.\n\nA match goes through three main phases according to the time of day. Roles with nighttime abilities are active during the night. All murders are committed during the night; mafia can speak among themselves. When daytime arrives, the town will discover the bodies of townspeople who died the night before, their cause of death, their role, their [[Will and testament|will]], and a death note. (It is also possible that nobody dies during the night.) Other actions that did not cause death (e.g. a Medium speaking with the dead, a Blackmailer silencing another player, a Doctor healing another player) are not announced by the game, but may be discussed by the players. One unique exception is the Retributionist who resurrects a dead Town player from the graveyard during the night and, if they are not blocked or controlled, the target comes back alive the following day. The game does not announce who resurrected them. Another exception is the Amnesiac who can \"remember\" or assume the role of a dead player during the night. Like the Retributionist, the game will not announce who the Amnesiac is.\n\nDuring the day, all townspeople gather to meet in a circle, facing a [[Death_by_hanging|lynching stake]] at the center. Players enter a discussion phase via text communication in a chatbox. Players typically inform each other of what happened to them or other players during the night before, if they can. Since the game begins with a Town majority, the discussion will revolve around lynching potentially evil players. Though the central goal may ostensibly be eliminating the evil players, Mafia will attempt to deceive Town into lynching innocents (i.e. other Town players) and saving themselves. Neutrals typically deceive everyone since they are aligned to neither Town nor Mafia, though some may win with either team. \n\nKeeping a will is a prevalent [[Metagaming|metagame]] behavior, especially for Town players since they do not know each other's roles. The will does not bequeath anything despite its name. It is used as a form of [[testimony]] to prove a player's claims, typically a claim of their role. Players write information about what they know or did in their will, so that once they die or when asked to disclose information, other Town players can piece together information to identify the \"good\" and \"evil\" townspeople. The will is automatically revealed after the player dies. Evil players usually keep fraudulent wills to deceive Town players into believing they're good. \n\nIn Classic and Ranked modes, where the roles are assigned for competitive purposes, role claiming is an important metagame strategy for Town players to [[Process of elimination|eliminate possibilities]]. A list of available roles or role categories (e.g. Town Protective, Random Mafia, Neutral Killing) is included in every game, so by process of elimination Town players can figure out the roles of each player. This is not useful in Any mode, however, because in that mode the roles are randomized, not categorized, and simply named \"Any\" on the role list.\n\nAfter the discussion phase, townspeople can vote for a player to be placed on trial. They can vote for anyone but themselves. The vote to try must be a majority. Once a player is put on the stake, they have a moment to defend themselves, in which only they can speak. Then comes judgement phase in which the townspeople must decide to vote Guilty, Innocent or Abstain on lynching the player on trial. The vote to lynch must pass majority. Abstain votes are not counted. A tie will be considered an Innocent judgement. When a Guilty judgement passes, the player on trial will be lynched and the day immediately finishes, commencing the start of nighttime. This voting process may repeat as long as time allows, to a maximum of three trials per day. The day-and-night process repeats until one alignment survives and accomplishes their win condition, or if a Neutral Killing player eliminates all Town and Mafia players.\n\nThe expansion pack ''The Coven'' introduced a new alignment, the Coven, which has a team win condition like that of Town and Mafia. It also added three exclusive game modes: Rivals, Lovers and VIP. There are Coven equivalents to vanilla game modes, except Rainbow, Dracula's Palace and Rapid.\n\n== Development ==\nBlankMediaGames LLC was founded by Josh Brittain and Blake Burns on February 1, 2014 with a working staff of two programmers, two artists and one sound designer. Their mission was to bring a ''Werewolf'' and ''Mafia'' based online video game to the market. A [[Kickstarter]] campaign began on February 14, 2014 to develop ''Town of Salem''. After thirty days, the fundraiser raised $17,190 surpassing its $15,000 goal.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/blankmediagames/town-of-salem-mafia-style-browser-game|title=Town of Salem - Mafia-style Browser Game|website=Kickstarter|language=en|access-date=2020-03-22}}</ref>\n\nAs development progressed with more donations, more features and mechanics were added. On September 13, 2014, the developers started a fundraiser for a Steam release, which would be its official release after alpha and beta versions. The fundraiser finished in 35 days, acquiring $114,197 from 7,506 backers. It surpassed its goal of $30,000.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/blankmediagames/town-of-salem-mobile-steam-localization|title=Town of Salem - Mobile, Steam, Localization|website=Kickstarter|language=en|access-date=2020-03-22}}</ref> The Steam version was released on December 14.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/blankmediagames/town-of-salem-mobile-steam-localization/posts/1084755|title=Update 29: v1.0.0 release and Town of Salem comes to Steam! \u00b7 Town of Salem - Mobile, Steam, Localization|website=Kickstarter|language=en|access-date=2020-03-22}}</ref>\n\n=== Ports ===\nOn March 31, 2016, another Kickstarter fundraiser began after the release of a [[mobile game|mobile]] beta version of the game.

It raised $389,005 from 9,551 backers in 30 days, and had a pledged goal of $10,000.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/blankmediagames/town-of-salem-the-card-game|title=Town of Salem - The Card Game|website=Kickstarter}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://blastawaythegamereview.com/2016/04/29/blankmediagames-turns-pc-game-town-of-salem-into-a-card-game/|title=BlankMediaGames Turns PC Game Town of Salem into a Card Game|first=Dustin|last=Murphy|date=April 30, 2016|website=Blast Away the Game Review}}</ref> Unlike the video game in which the computer moderates and generates roles for each player, the card game requires a Moderator role, whose function is that of the video game's computer, like switching the day-night cycles and assigning each player a role. The card game gameplay is more akin to the original ''Mafia'' game, in which players close their eyes during nighttime and take turns using their abilities.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.blankmediagames.com/how-does-the-card-game-work/|title=How does the Card Game work? &#124; BlankMediaGames|website=www.blankmediagames.com}}</ref> The game also included an NSFW version of the cards in reward of Unlocking 12 achievements during its Kickstarter. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/blankmediagames/town-of-salem-the-card-game/|title=Town of Salem Kickstarter &#124; BlankMediaGames|website=www.blankmediagames.com}}</ref>\n\n=== ''The Coven'' ===\nOn May 16, 2017, the [[expansion pack]] ''The Coven'' was announced. The expansion added one new faction, the Coven, and fifteen new roles. The original Witch role is now the Coven Leader. Other Coven roles include the Hex Master, Poisoner, Potion Master, Medusa and Necromancer. Town received four new roles: Crusader, Tracker, Trapper, and Psychic. Mafia received two new roles: Ambusher and Hypnotist. And Neutral received three new roles: Guardian Angel, Pirate, and Plaguebearer. Three new game modes were added: Coven VIP, Lover, and Rivals. Unlike the vanilla game, the expansion pack is not free-to-play. For players who paid for the Steam version of the game, the pack is half price.

It was released on [[Steam (service)|Steam]] for [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] and [[macOS]] on December 15, 2014. Early alpha and beta versions were browser-based and [[free-to-play]]. On October 14, 2018, the game was released for mobile [[iOS]] and [[Android (operating system)|Android]] platforms after a successful and long-supported [[Kickstarter]] fundraiser. On July 24, 2019, a beta [[Unity (game engine)|Unity]] port for the Steam version of the game became available. The free-to-play, [[Adobe Flash Player|Flash]] browser version is still available but no longer supported since 2020, as the developers focus on porting the game to Unity. ''Town of Salem'' is reportedly the largest online version of the classic social deduction party game [[Mafia (party game)|''Werewolf'']].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.gamasutra.com/view/pressreleases/299329/Indie_Smash_Hit_Town_of_Salem_Gets_New_Expansion_The%0ACoven.php|title=Indie Smash Hit Town of Salem Gets New Expansion: The Coven|website=www.gamasutra.com|language=en|access-date=2020-03-22}}</ref> It has a player base of over 8 million.<ref>{{cite web |title=Popular Online Game, Town of Salem, Hit with Massive Data Breach |url=https://evolvemga.com/town-of-salem/ |website=Evolve MGA |accessdate=23 March 2020}}</ref>\n\n== Gameplay ==\nThe game is inspired by the party games ''Werewolf'' and ''[[Mafia (party game)|Mafia]]'', in which players adopt different roles belonging to different teams, of an informed minority and uninformed majority, aiming to eliminate each other for control of the village or town. As the name implies, the game takes place in the historical town of [[Salem, Massachusetts|Salem]], [[Massachusetts]], alluding to the infamous [[Salem witch trials|witch-hunt trials]] that killed innocent townspeople due to paranoia and superstition. The chief strategy of the game is to survive and accomplish win conditions. Players use a combination of role abilities, teamwork, communication, deduction and deception to achieve victory.\n\nThe game features 49 unique roles, including ones from the ''The Coven'' expansion pack.<ref name=\"the gamer 2019\">{{cite web |last1=Pellow |first1=Nichole |title=Town of Salem: 5 Best Roles To Play (& 5 Worst) |url=https://www.thegamer.com/town-of-salem-best-worst-roles/ |website=The Gamer |accessdate=23 March 2020}}</ref> Seven game modes and one custom mode are available on the vanilla. The bespoke modes are Classic, Ranked Practice, Ranked, Rapid, All Any, Rainbow and Dracula's Palace. They are modes that have pre-selected roles for the match. Custom mode allows the host of the match to choose the roles available. All modes except Custom and Rapid require 15 players. Seven is the minimum number of players for Custom and Rapid modes. Once the match begins, the players will create their name for the match. If they did not type in a name, the game will automatically select a default name for them. Default names are based on the real-life figures of the Salem witch trials. After that, the game will designate each player a role according to an algorithm.<ref name=\"game skinny\" /> \n\nIn the vanilla game, there are three alignments: Town, Mafia and Neutral.<ref name=\"the gamer 2019\" /> Town and Mafia are two teams with their own win conditions. The win condition for Town is to \"lynch every criminal and evildoer.\" For Mafia it's to \"kill anyone that will not submit to the Mafia.\"<ref>{{cite web |title=Roles |url=https://www.blankmediagames.com/roles/ |website=BlankMediaGames |accessdate=22 March 2020}}</ref> Town players are uninformed, meaning they do not know the roles of other players. Mafia players are informed, meaning they know who other Mafia players are, but they do not know the roles of non-Mafia players. Using their role abilities and deduction, players discover the roles of other players to facilitate their victory. Town and Mafia can only win the game if the opposing team(s) perishes entirely.\n\nNeutrals have individual win conditions that must be achieved on their own. When a Neutral player dies without completing their win condition, they can no longer win the game even if another Neutral player completes their win condition. Some Neutral roles may survive and win with either Town or Mafia, as long as their win condition is completed. Neutral Killing roles, specifically, can only win when Town and Mafia are eliminated.\n\nA match goes through three main phases according to the time of day. Roles with nighttime abilities are active during the night. All murders are committed during the night; mafia can speak among themselves. When daytime arrives, the town will discover the bodies of townspeople who died the night before, their cause of death, their role, their [[Will and testament|will]], and a death note. (It is also possible that nobody dies during the night.) Other actions that did not cause death (e.g. a Medium speaking with the dead, a Blackmailer silencing another player, a Doctor healing another player) are not announced by the game, but may be discussed by the players. One unique exception is the Retributionist who resurrects a dead Town player from the graveyard during the night and, if they are not blocked or controlled, the target comes back alive the following day. The game does not announce who resurrected them. Another exception is the Amnesiac who can \"remember\" or assume the role of a dead player during the night. Like the Retributionist, the game will not announce who the Amnesiac is.\n\nDuring the day, all townspeople gather to meet in a circle, facing a [[Death_by_hanging|lynching stake]] at the center. Players enter a discussion phase via text communication in a chatbox. Players typically inform each other of what happened to them or other players during the night before, if they can. Since the game begins with a Town majority, the discussion will revolve around lynching potentially evil players. Though the central goal may ostensibly be eliminating the evil players, Mafia will attempt to deceive Town into lynching innocents (i.e. other Town players) and saving themselves. Neutrals typically deceive everyone since they are aligned to neither Town nor Mafia, though some may win with either team. \n\nKeeping a will is a prevalent [[Metagaming|metagame]] behavior, especially for Town players since they do not know each other's roles. The will does not bequeath anything despite its name. It is used as a form of [[testimony]] to prove a player's claims, typically a claim of their role. Players write information about what they know or did in their will, so that once they die or when asked to disclose information, other Town players can piece together information to identify the \"good\" and \"evil\" townspeople. The will is automatically revealed after the player dies. Evil players usually keep fraudulent wills to deceive Town players into believing they're good. \n\nIn Classic and Ranked modes, where the roles are assigned for competitive purposes, role claiming is an important metagame strategy for Town players to [[Process of elimination|eliminate possibilities]]. A list of available roles or role categories (e.g. Town Protective, Random Mafia, Neutral Killing) is included in every game, so by process of elimination Town players can figure out the roles of each player. This is not useful in Any mode, however, because in that mode the roles are randomized, not categorized, and simply named \"Any\" on the role list.\n\nAfter the discussion phase, townspeople can vote for a player to be placed on trial. They can vote for anyone but themselves. The vote to try must be a majority. Once a player is put on the stake, they have a moment to defend themselves, in which only they can speak. Then comes judgement phase in which the townspeople must decide to vote Guilty, Innocent or Abstain on lynching the player on trial. The vote to lynch must pass majority. Abstain votes are not counted. A tie will be considered an Innocent judgement. When a Guilty judgement passes, the player on trial will be lynched and the day immediately finishes, commencing the start of nighttime. This voting process may repeat as long as time allows, to a maximum of three trials per day. The day-and-night process repeats until one alignment survives and accomplishes their win condition, or if a Neutral Killing player eliminates all Town and Mafia players.\n\nThe expansion pack ''The Coven'' introduced a new alignment, the Coven, which has a team win condition like that of Town and Mafia. It also added three exclusive game modes: Rivals, Lovers and VIP. There are Coven equivalents to vanilla game modes, except Rainbow, Dracula's Palace and Rapid.\n\n== Development ==\nBlankMediaGames LLC was founded by Josh Brittain and Blake Burns on February 1, 2014 with a working staff of two programmers, two artists and one sound designer. Their mission was to bring a ''Werewolf'' and ''Mafia'' based online video game to the market. A [[Kickstarter]] campaign began on February 14, 2014 to develop ''Town of Salem''. After thirty days, the fundraiser raised $17,190 surpassing its $15,000 goal.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/blankmediagames/town-of-salem-mafia-style-browser-game|title=Town of Salem - Mafia-style Browser Game|website=Kickstarter|language=en|access-date=2020-03-22}}</ref>\n\nAs development progressed with more donations, more features and mechanics were added. On September 13, 2014, the developers started a fundraiser for a Steam release, which would be its official release after alpha and beta versions. The fundraiser finished in 35 days, acquiring $114,197 from 7,506 backers. It surpassed its goal of $30,000.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/blankmediagames/town-of-salem-mobile-steam-localization|title=Town of Salem - Mobile, Steam, Localization|website=Kickstarter|language=en|access-date=2020-03-22}}</ref> The Steam version was released on December 14.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/blankmediagames/town-of-salem-mobile-steam-localization/posts/1084755|title=Update 29: v1.0.0 release and Town of Salem comes to Steam! \u00b7 Town of Salem - Mobile, Steam, Localization|website=Kickstarter|language=en|access-date=2020-03-22}}</ref>\n\n=== Ports ===\nOn March 31, 2016, another Kickstarter fundraiser began after the release of a [[mobile game|mobile]] beta version of the game.

The expansion added one new faction, the Coven, and fifteen new roles. The original Witch role is now the Coven Leader. Other Coven roles include the Hex Master, Poisoner, Potion Master, Medusa and Necromancer. Town received four new roles: Crusader, Tracker, Trapper, and Psychic. Mafia received two new roles: Ambusher and Hypnotist. And Neutral received three new roles: Guardian Angel, Pirate, and Plaguebearer. Three new game modes were added: Coven VIP, Lover, and Rivals. Unlike the vanilla game, the expansion pack is not free-to-play. For players who paid for the Steam version of the game, the pack is half price. It was released through the Steam store on June 6.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://nerdbacon.com/town-salem-coven-expansion-announced/|title=Town of Salem \"The Coven\" Expansion Announced|date=2017-05-20|website=Nerd Bacon Reviews|language=en-US|access-date=2020-03-22}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.blankmediagames.com/town-of-salem-the-coven-announcement/|title=Town of Salem: The Coven Announcement {{!}} BlankMediaGames|website=www.blankmediagames.com|access-date=2020-03-22}}</ref>\n\n=== Data breach ===\nA [[data breach]] that affected over 7.6 million players of ''Town of Salem'' was disclosed in an email to security firm DeHashed on December 28, 2018.
