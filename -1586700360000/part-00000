{"title_page": "Hip hop music in the Pacific Northwest", "text_new": "'''Northwest hip hop''' is [[hip hop]] or [[rap music]] that originates from the [[Pacific Northwest]] of [[North America]], encompassing major cities such as [[Portland, Oregon|Portland]] ([[Oregon]]), [[Seattle]] ([[Washington State|Washington]]), and [[Vancouver]] ([[British Columbia]]). Northwest hip hop music mixes elements from various genres of music to form a sound different from its southern neighbor, [[West Coast hip hop]]. For many years the scene existed mainly as an underground genre, but recently Northwest hip-hop has seen more and more mainstream acceptance, with artists such as [[Macklemore]] gaining nationwide attention.\n\n==History==\n\n=== Pre-1993 ===\nDuring the late 1970s, high school kids from the [[Rainier Beach, Seattle, Washington|Rainier Beach]], [[Rainier Valley, Seattle, Washington|Rainier Valley]], and Central District areas in Seattle started to perfect early hip hop forms of dancing in the northwest defined as bopping.{{citation needed|date=October 2011}} Many of the local underage clubs and high schools in south Seattle held formal contests called bop-offs where dancers would compete against one another.\n\nIn the early 1980s, soldiers positioned at [[Tacoma, Washington|Tacoma's]] military bases provided the foundation for a growing hip-hop fan base in the [[Pacific Northwest|Northwest]]. This increased demand for hip-hop coincided with some of the first hip-hop dances in [[Seattle, Washington|Seattle]], which were held at public-housing recreation centers and featured the Emerald Street Boys and Anthony \"[[Sir Mix-A-Lot]]\" Ray.{{citation needed|date=October 2011}} Simultaneously, \"Nasty Nes\" Rodriguez launched the Northwest's first all-rap radio program, ''Fresh Tracks'', and soon Nasty Nes began airing self-produced tracks by Sir Mix-A-Lot, as well as the Emerald Street Boys, MC LeRap, PDQ, and Andy Hamlin.{{citation needed|date=October 2011}} Fresh Tracks was a 30-minute show that played on Sunday nights on KKFX 1250 (\"KFOX\" and formerly KKDZ), and consisted of a mix of new songs and a mastermix created by Nasty Nes (Stranger article). These mixes were made up of songs by The World's Famous Supreme Team, Malcolm McLaren, Run-D.M.C. and others (Stranger article). Due to the show's popularity, the station's producer allowed Nes to expand it to a Monday through Friday, 9pm to midnight show called NightBeat that featured prominent R&B songs as well as intermixed rap songs (Stranger article). As Seattle's music scene evolved, so did the Seattle breakdance and graffiti crews, including B-Boy groups like Silver Chain Gang, Circuit Breakers, and Breaking Mechanism, and graffiti writers such as Spaide, Streak, DadOne, and Spraycan. At this time the Northwest was considered an empty canvas, which lagged behind other regions in creating a unique identity that was associated with hip hop. With this space there was room for an eclectic group of identities to form, however none were successful in formulating a Seattle identity.<ref>Murray Forman (2000). \u2018Represent\u2019: race, space and place in rap music.

In 1993, Jonathon \"Wordsayer\" Moore of [[Source of Labor]] approached Caroline Davenport of Tasty Shows, who was responsible for booking a popular Seattle venue called RCKCNDY.

The [[Teen Dance Ordinance]], which had been in effect since 1985, made it almost impossible for most Seattle venues to book all-ages shows. The social turmoil of Seattle during the late 1990s ([[WTO Ministerial Conference of 1999 protest activity|The World Trade Organization Protest]]), the city's outspoken political opposition to President [[George W. Bush]], and the despised Teen Dance Ordinance characterized the socially conscious style that defined Northwest hip-hop after 1993, a style that was continually strengthened as the hip-hop culture was attacked and labeled as violent and disruptive. However, production companies grew in NW like Winetime productions producing in the 1990s for national artist like The Click, Celly cell, E40 and more. Winetime took then midwest/local Artist Tony-O and climbed the billboard charts in 1998 and 99 peaking at #14 in Rap Singles with a song called PHD (Playa hata degree). Rap artist Tony-O is the only NW artist other than Mix A Lot until Macklemore to top the billboard charts in hip-hop at that time. \n\nIn 2002 the Teen Dance Ordinance was lifted and replaced by the less draconian [[Teen Dance Ordinance|All-ages Dance Ordinance]] and hip-hop began its Northwest resurgence.{{citation needed|date=October 2011}}\n\n===2002 to present===\nThe departure of the [[Teen Dance Ordinance]] in 2002 meant small Seattle venues could afford to host local hip-hop shows.{{citation needed|date=October 2011}} Currently, the Northwest maintains a self-perpetuating [[underground hip hop|underground hip-hop movement]], a culture that is maintained almost entirely by word of mouth, local interest, and internet exposure.{{citation needed|date=October 2011}}\n\nThe Minneapolis-based [[Rhymesayers Entertainment]], a quickly growing record label, has signed multiple artists from Seattle such as [[Boom Bap Project]], [[Grayskul]], [[Grieves]], [[Jake One]], and [[Vitamin D]], which also contributes to its growth.

Winter also starred in the lead role. All three were involved in the short-lived [[MTV]] sketch comedy show ''[[The Idiot Box (TV series)|The Idiot Box]]'', and ''Freaked'' retains the same brand of surrealistic and absurdist humor as seen in the show. ''Freaked'' was Alex Winter's last feature film before he shifted to cameo and television films for many years until 2013's ''[[Grand Piano (film)|Grand Piano]]''.\n\nOriginally conceived as a low-budget horror film featuring the band [[Butthole Surfers]],<ref name=\"DVD Commentary\">{{cite video|people =Stern, Tom; Winter, Alex|title=DVD Commentary for 'Freaked'|medium=DVD|date=2005|publisher=Anchor Bay}}</ref> ''Freaked'' went through a number of rewrites, eventually developing into a [[black comedy]] set within a [[sideshow]], which was picked up by [[20th Century Fox]] for a feature film. After several poor test screenings and a change in studio executives who then found the film too \"weird\", the movie was pulled from a wide distribution (except for [[Australia]] and [[Japan]]) and only played on a handful of screens in the United States.\n\n==Plot==\nSkye Daley ([[Brooke Shields]]) is interviewing beloved former child star Ricky Coogin ([[Alex Winter]]). Rather bluntly, Skye asks how Ricky so quickly went from one of America's sweethearts to a name that makes children scream in terror. Ricky, completely in silhouette, begins his story.\n\nRicky is shown accepting an endorsement contract from slimy mega-corporation E.E.S. (Everything Except Shoes) to promote \"Zygrot 24\", a toxic fertilizer, in South America. Although hesitant at first, the greedy, self-centered Coogin caves in after their sleazy CEO ([[William Sadler (actor)|William Sadler]]) offers him $5,000,000. Ricky travels immediately to the South American town of \"Santa Flan\" with his buddy Ernie ([[Michael Stoyanov]]). During their flight, the duo have a run-in with Ricky's 12-year old number one fan Stuey Gluck (Alex Zuckerman). Stuey begs Ricky not to promote Zygrot 24 only to accidentally fall out of the plane.\n\nOnce Ricky and Ernie arrive in Santa Flan, they cross paths with an angry group protesting Zygrot 24 and Ricky. In the group is [[environmentalist]] Julie ([[Megan Ward]]), who Ricky is instantly smitten with. The two con Julie into thinking they're also environmentalists (Ricky posing as a highly injured accident victim, his face covered in bandages) and she agrees to join them on a trip to another protest. However, she soon finds out their true identities and the three are stuck with each other for the rest of the drive. They decide to take a detour to see Freek Land, a local [[freak show]] only to wind up in the clutches of demented proprietor and mad scientist Elijah C. Skuggs ([[Randy Quaid]]) and his henchman, Toad ([[Jaime Cardriche]]). Utilizing his \"Testy Freeks Machine\", he merges Julie and Ernie into a single body and turns Ricky into a hideous green mutation. As Elijah has run out of Zygrot, only half of Ricky's body is mutated.\n\nRicky meets the other freaks, including Ortiz the [[Fedor Jeftichew|Dog Boy]] ([[Keanu Reeves]]), Worm ([[Derek McGrath]]) a giant arthropod, Cowboy ([[John Hawkes (actor)|John Hawkes]]) a literal anthropomorphic cow, the [[Bearded Lady]] ([[Mr. T]] in a dress) and Sockhead ([[Bobcat Goldthwait]]), who has a [[sock puppet]] for a head. Ricky has trouble adjusting to his new life as a freak, though he opens up when some of the other freaks recount how they were captured and disfigured by Elijah. During his first performance, Ricky foregoes his act (which inexplicably had him dressing like a caveman) and with some suggestions from Worm he performs a Shakespearean monologue which captivates the audience. Spotting his agent in the crowd, Ricky jumps off the stage hoping to be rescued, but flies into a murderous rage when the agent makes fun of him. Ricky tears his agent's head off and the crowd runs screaming into the night, with Elijah simply noting \"that's what I call entertainment.\"\n\nThe next day Ricky discovers to his horror that he is seeing a floating specter of Stuey. He angrily shoos Stuey's astral form away, but Cowboy states that only a pair of soulmates can have such a strong telepathic bond. After multiple failed attempts to sell the story to newspapers Stuey manages to sell Ricky's story to the [[Weekly World News]], who will print anything, but ends up being captured by a group of shady businessmen that work for E.E.S.\n\nRicky tries to escape by stealing the outfit of a milkman, only to be captured by Skuggs's gun-toting Rastafarian eyeball henchmen and brought before Elijah. Skuggs tells Ricky he plans to have him fully mutated into a blood-thirsty monster who will kill all the other freaks at the next show. On his way back to the freaks shed, he runs into the other freaks also making an escape attempt, and also dressed as milkmen. Ricky butts heads with Ortiz and the two fight until Ortiz is distracted by a squirrel and runs off, the Rasta eyeballs in pursuit. With Ortiz gone Ricky is named the new Freaks leader. Ricky and the freaks break into Skuggs's lab to create a serum that will complete Ricky's mutation and have him kill Skuggs instead of the freaks. Ricky accidentally leaves the concoction in the lab, but finds a bag of tasty macaroons which the freaks enjoy.\n\nRicky eventually finds out that Elijah's Zygrot suppliers are none other than E.E.S., who arrive at Freek Land with a shipment of Zygrot 24 and an imprisoned Stuey Gluck. As they discuss their plans to mutate the world's population into an race of E.E.S. workers and consumers, Stuey follows a telepathic tip from Ricky and manages to escape, grabbing the coffee can of mutation goo left behind by Ricky along the way.\n\nOn the night of the show, Stuey appears with the batch of Zygrot only to have an annoyed biker dump it onto him, which turns him into a grotesque seven-foot monster. Stuey kills the biker and prepares to storm the stage and save Ricky. The Rasta eyeballs attempt to kill Stuey but he kicks dust into their eyes, blinding them. Toad tries to swallow Stuey only for Julie and Ernie to throw an M80 onto Toad's tongue which he swallows and promptly explodes. In response, Elijah infects Ricky with his own Zygrot, turning him into an equally grotesque seven-foot monster. As Ricky and Stuey battle to the death onstage, Elijah notices the E.E.S. executives trying to steal his equipment. Elijah stops them by soaking them with a Zygrot bazooka, mutating and merging them all into a giant, fleshy shoe.\n\nRight before Ricky is about to destroy Stuey, Cowboy reminds him that Stuey is his soulmate. A wave of compassion comes over him, and he gives Stuey a hug. Enraged, Elijah unsuccessfully tries to fight Ricky, who bashes him in the head, breaking his spine. Skuggs tries to get Ricky not to kill him by offering him the antidote for his mutation, telling him it was a time-delayed serum baked into a batch of macaroons. Ricky comments that he skimped on the sugar and punches Skuggs, sending him flying into the vat of Zygrot 24. An FBI task force arrives to save Ricky after having learned of Stuey's article. Skuggs suddenly reemerges from the Vat, having taken the form of Skye Daley. The FBI task force guns Skuggs/Skye down.\n\nBack at the interview, it's revealed that Ricky had turned back to normal (along with most of the other freaks, except for Worm, who hates Macaroons). They are then joined by Ortiz who has finally caught the squirrel and  Stuey, still a giant super-freak. Skye comments on Elijah mutating to look like her, and Ricky realizes that Skye actually is Elijah. Skuggs lunges after Ricky with a [[machete]], only to be gunned down by the now normal Julie. As she embraces Ricky, Skye rises again, this time to be gunned down by Ernie. Ricky and Julie kiss and everyone waves farewell to the audience until the film ends on a frozen shot of Skuggs once again rising up to attack Ricky.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n*[[Alex Winter]] as Ricky Coogin\n*[[Michael Stoyanov]] as Ernie\n*[[Megan Ward]] as Julie\n*[[Randy Quaid]] as Elijah C.

Winter, Stern and Surfers frontman [[Gibby Haynes]] began work on the first draft of the script, envisioning it as an obscene, ultra-violent horror film once again featuring the Butthole Surfers, costing around $100,000.<ref name=\"DVD Commentary\"/> The idea was, as Alex Winter put it, \"''[[Beach Blanket Bingo]]'' meets ''[[The Evil Dead]]''\".<ref name=officialsite>{{cite web|url=http://trouperproductions.com/Freekland/home.htm |title=The Official Freekland Website |accessdate=2007-09-21 |author=Freekland.com |year=2005 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100924112458/http://trouperproductions.com/Freekland/home.htm |archivedate=September 24, 2010 }}</ref> The two fished the script around to various studios for years, but to no avail.\n\nFollowing the end of production on Stern and Winter's MTV sketch comedy show ''[[The Idiot Box (TV series)|The Idiot Box]]'', staff writer Tim Burns was recruited to join the two in a number of rewrites. The film was completely revisioned, dropping the aspect of the Butthole Surfers entirely and turning it into a full comedy in the vein of the ''[[Monty Python's Flying Circus|Monty Python]]'' and ''[[MAD Magazine]]''-inspired humour that was present in ''The Idiot Box''.<ref name=\"Conversation\">{{cite video|people=Burns,Tim|title=A Conversation with Tim Burns|medium=DVD|date=2005|publisher=Anchor Bay}}</ref>\n\nWinter and Stern pitched the idea to [[20th Century Fox]]. [[Joe Roth]], the head of the studio at that time, loved the idea and offered the two a twelve million dollar deal to direct it, despite the fact that neither of them had any experience directing a major Hollywood film and had never even shot on [[35mm movie film|35mm film]] before. The only condition was that the film had to be rewritten and toned down to fit a [[PG-13]] rating; therefore, most of the profanity was written out of the final draft to fit MPAA standards. Within a month of being picked up, the film began production.<ref name=\"DVD Commentary\"/>\n\nThe makeup effects requirements for the film were so substantial, and the lead time before filming was so short, the makeup effects characters for the film were designed and created by three different companies: [[Tony Gardner (designer)|Tony Gardner's]] company [[Alterian, Inc.]], Steve Johnson's XFX, Inc., and Screaming Mad George's Studio.\n\n20th Century Fox had such high expectations for the film that they released a number of products based on it, including a line of action figures, a novelization and, most notably, a comic book released by Hamilton Comics (however, since the comic was drawn before most of the casting was completed, none of its characters look anything like their real-life counterparts).<ref name=officialsite/>\n\n===Complications===\nDuring filming, Joe Roth was fired as studio head by [[Rupert Murdoch]] and replaced with [[Peter Chernin]], who didn't like the film nor the fact that twelve million dollars was being invested in it.<ref name=officialsite/> Chernin cut the film's post-production budget, thus forcing a lot of the soundtrack (including a demo song that [[Iggy Pop]] had recorded for the closing credits) and special effects to be greatly cut down or eliminated altogether.<ref name=\"DVD Commentary\"/> The film's title was changed, as well, from the poorly received \"''Hideous Mutant Freekz''\" to the supposedly more accessible \"''Freaked''\", a title neither Winter nor Stern much cared for.\n\nAfter several poor test screenings, Fox chose to pull the film from a nationwide release and cut its advertising budget, leaving no money for commercials or newspaper ads.<ref name=\"Conversation\"/> ''Freaked'' had its official premiere at the [[Toronto International Film Festival]] on September 11, 1993. Despite initial positive critical response, the film opened October 3, 1993 in the United States on only two screens, making a mere $6,957 in its first weekend.<ref name=IMDB>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0109838/business|title=IMDb Business Statistics for 'Freaked'|accessdate=2007-09-21|author=IMDb.com|year=2005|publisher=}}</ref> It quickly dropped out of theatres, making less than $30,000 and becoming a failure at the box-office, and was released on [[VHS]] on April 20, 1994.\n\n==Reception==\n''Freaked'' received a mostly mixed response from critics.

The film was also nominated for a [[Saturn Award]] for Best Make-up.\n\n==Home media==\nOn July 12, 2005, [[Anchor Bay Entertainment]] and 20th Century Fox released a special-edition two-disc DVD, featuring extra material, including deleted scenes, audio commentary, behind-the-scenes footage and two short films from Alex Winter and Tom Stern, the 15-minute film noir parody ''Squeal Of Death'' and a black-and-white skit titled ''NYU Sight & Sound Project''. This DVD has since gone out of print.\n\nOn August 6, 2013, Anchor Bay and [[Starz Inc.]] re-released the movie on DVD and Blu-ray. This new release does not include any of the bonus features from the earlier, now out of print DVD.\n\n==Soundtrack==\nA soundtrack release for ''Freaked'' was planned, but following the loss of their post-production budget, the idea never came to fruition.

All three were involved in the short-lived [[MTV]] sketch comedy show ''[[The Idiot Box (TV series)|The Idiot Box]]'', and ''Freaked'' retains the same brand of surrealistic and absurdist humor as seen in the show. ''Freaked'' was Alex Winter's last feature film before he shifted to cameo and television films for many years until 2013's ''[[Grand Piano (film)|Grand Piano]]''.\n\nOriginally conceived as a low-budget horror film featuring the band [[Butthole Surfers]],<ref name=\"DVD Commentary\">{{cite video|people =Stern, Tom; Winter, Alex|title=DVD Commentary for 'Freaked'|medium=DVD|date=2005|publisher=Anchor Bay}}</ref> ''Freaked'' went through a number of rewrites, eventually developing into a [[black comedy]] set within a [[sideshow]], which was picked up by [[20th Century Fox]] for a feature film. After several poor test screenings and a change in studio executives who then found the film too \"weird\", the movie was pulled from a wide distribution (except for [[Australia]] and [[Japan]]) and only played on a handful of screens in the United States.\n\n==Plot==\nSkye Daley ([[Brooke Shields]]) is interviewing beloved former child star Ricky Coogin ([[Alex Winter]]). Rather bluntly, Skye asks how Ricky so quickly went from one of America's sweethearts to a name that makes children scream in terror. Ricky, completely in silhouette, begins his story.\n\nRicky is shown accepting an endorsement contract from slimy mega-corporation E.E.S. (Everything Except Shoes) to promote \"Zygrot 24\", a toxic fertilizer, in South America. Although hesitant at first, the greedy, self-centered Coogin caves in after their sleazy CEO ([[William Sadler (actor)|William Sadler]]) offers him $5,000,000. Ricky travels immediately to the South American town of \"Santa Flan\" with his buddy Ernie ([[Michael Stoyanov]]). During their flight, the duo have a run-in with Ricky's 12-year old number one fan Stuey Gluck (Alex Zuckerman). Stuey begs Ricky not to promote Zygrot 24 only to accidentally fall out of the plane.\n\nOnce Ricky and Ernie arrive in Santa Flan, they cross paths with an angry group protesting Zygrot 24 and Ricky. In the group is [[environmentalist]] Julie ([[Megan Ward]]), who Ricky is instantly smitten with. The two con Julie into thinking they're also environmentalists (Ricky posing as a highly injured accident victim, his face covered in bandages) and she agrees to join them on a trip to another protest. However, she soon finds out their true identities and the three are stuck with each other for the rest of the drive. They decide to take a detour to see Freek Land, a local [[freak show]] only to wind up in the clutches of demented proprietor and mad scientist Elijah C. Skuggs ([[Randy Quaid]]) and his henchman, Toad ([[Jaime Cardriche]]). Utilizing his \"Testy Freeks Machine\", he merges Julie and Ernie into a single body and turns Ricky into a hideous green mutation. As Elijah has run out of Zygrot, only half of Ricky's body is mutated.\n\nRicky meets the other freaks, including Ortiz the [[Fedor Jeftichew|Dog Boy]] ([[Keanu Reeves]]) Worm ([[Derek McGrath]]) a giant arthropod, Cowboy ([[John Hawkes (actor)|John Hawkes]]) a literal anthropomorphic cow, the [[Bearded Lady]] ([[Mr. T]] in a dress) and Sockhead ([[Bobcat Goldthwait]]), who has a [[sock puppet]] for a head. Ricky has trouble adjusting to his new life as a freak, though he opens up when some of the other freaks recount how they were captured and disfigured by Elijah. During his first performance, Ricky foregoes his act (which inexplicably had him dressing like a caveman) and with some suggestions from Worm he performs a Shakespearean monologue which captivates the audience. Spotting his agent in the crowd, Ricky jumps off the stage hoping to be rescued, but flies into a murderous rage when the agent makes fun of him. Ricky tears his agent's head off and the crowd runs screaming into the night, with Elijah simply noting \"that's what I call entertainment.\"\n\nThe next day Ricky discovers to his horror that he is seeing a floating specter of Stuey. He angrily shoos Stuey's astral form away, but Cowboy states that only a pair of soulmates can have such a strong telepathic bond. After multiple failed attempts to sell the story to newspapers Stuey manages to sell Ricky's story to the [[Weekly World News]], who will print anything, but ends up being captured by a group of shady businessmen that work for E.E.S.\n\nRicky tries to escape by stealing the outfit of a milkman, only to be captured by Skuggs's gun-toting Rastafarian eyeball henchmen and brought before Elijah. Skuggs tells Ricky he plans to have him fully mutated into a blood-thirsty monster who will kill all the other freaks at the next show. On his way back to the freaks shed, he runs into the other freaks also making an escape attempt, and also dressed as milkmen. Ricky butts heads with Ortiz and the two fight until Ortiz is distracted by a squirrel and runs off, the Rasta eyeballs in pursuit. With Ortiz gone Ricky is named the new Freaks leader. Ricky and the freaks break into Skuggs's lab to create a serum that will complete Ricky's mutation and have him kill Skuggs instead of the freaks. Ricky accidentally leaves the concoction in the lab, but finds a bag of tasty macaroons which the freaks enjoy.\n\nRicky eventually finds out that Elijah's Zygrot suppliers are none other than E.E.S., who arrive at Freek Land with a shipment of Zygrot 24 and an imprisoned Stuey Gluck. As they discuss their plans to mutate the world's population into an race of E.E.S workers and consumers, Stuey follows a telepathic tip from Ricky and manages to escape, grabbing the coffee can of mutation goo left behind by Ricky along the way.\n\nOn the night of the show, Stuey appears with the batch of Zygrot only to have an annoyed biker dump it onto him, which turns him into a grotesque seven-foot monster. Stuey kills the biker and prepares to storm the stage and save Ricky. The Rasta eyeballs attempt to kill Stuey but he kicks dust into their eyes, blinding them. Toad tries to swallow Stuey only for Julie and Ernie to throw an M80 onto Toad's tongue which he swallows and promptly explodes. In response, Elijah infects Ricky with his own Zygrot, turning him into an equally grotesque seven-foot monster. As Ricky and Stuey battle to the death onstage, Elijah notices the E.E.S. executives trying to steal his equipment. Elijah stops them by soaking them with a Zygrot bazooka, mutating and merging them all into a giant, fleshy shoe.\n\nRight before Ricky is about to destroy Stuey, Cowboy reminds him that Stuey is his soulmate. A wave of compassion comes over him, and he gives Stuey a hug. Enraged, Elijah unsuccessfully tries to fight Ricky, who bashes him in the head, breaking his spine. Skuggs tries to get Ricky not to kill him by offering him the antidote for his mutation, telling him it was a time-delayed serum baked into a batch of macaroons. Ricky comments that he skimped on the sugar and punches Skuggs, sending him flying into the vat of Zygrot 24. An FBI task force arrives to save Ricky after having learned of Stuey's article. Skuggs suddenly reemerges from the Vat, having taken the form of Skye Daley. The FBI task force guns Skuggs/Skye down.\n\nBack at the interview, it's revealed that Ricky had turned back to normal (along with most of the other freaks, except for Worm, who hates Macaroons). They are then joined by Ortiz who has finally caught the squirrel and  Stuey, still a giant super-freak. Skye comments on Elijah mutating to look like her, and Ricky realizes that Skye actually is Elijah. Skuggs lunges after Ricky with a [[machete]], only to be gunned down by the now normal Julie. As she embraces Ricky, Skye rises again, this time to be gunned down by Ernie. Ricky and Julie kiss and everyone waves farewell to the audience until the film ends on a frozen shot of Skuggs once again rising up to attack Ricky.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n*[[Alex Winter]] as Ricky Coogin\n*[[Michael Stoyanov]] as Ernie\n*[[Megan Ward]] as Julie\n*[[Randy Quaid]] as Elijah C.

Winter, Stern and Surfers frontman [[Gibby Haynes]] began work on the first draft of the script, envisioning it as an obscene, ultra-violent horror film once again featuring the Butthole Surfers, costing around $100,000.<ref name=\"DVD Commentary\"/> The idea was, as Alex Winter put it, \"''[[Beach Blanket Bingo]]'' meets ''[[The Evil Dead]]''\".<ref name=officialsite>{{cite web|url=http://trouperproductions.com/Freekland/home.htm |title=The Official Freekland Website |accessdate=2007-09-21 |author=Freekland.com |year=2005 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100924112458/http://trouperproductions.com/Freekland/home.htm |archivedate=September 24, 2010 }}</ref> The two fished the script around to various studios for years, but to no avail.\n\nFollowing the end of production on Stern and Winter's MTV sketch comedy show ''[[The Idiot Box (TV series)|The Idiot Box]]'', staff writer Tim Burns was recruited to join the two in a number of rewrites. The film was completely revisioned, dropping the aspect of the Butthole Surfers entirely and turning it into a full comedy in the vein of the ''[[Monty Python's Flying Circus|Monty Python]]'' and ''[[MAD Magazine]]''-inspired humour that was present in ''The Idiot Box''.<ref name=\"Conversation\">{{cite video|people=Burns,Tim|title=A Conversation with Tim Burns|medium=DVD|date=2005|publisher=Anchor Bay}}</ref>\n\nWinter and Stern pitched the idea to [[20th Century Fox]]. [[Joe Roth]], the head of the studio at that time, loved the idea and offered the two a twelve million dollar deal to direct it, despite the fact that neither of them had any experience directing a major Hollywood film and had never even shot on [[35mm movie film|35mm film]] before. The only condition was that the film had to be rewritten and toned down to fit a [[PG-13]] rating; therefore, most of the profanity was written out of the final draft to fit MPAA standards. Within a month of being picked up, the film began production.<ref name=\"DVD Commentary\"/>\n\nThe makeup effects requirements for the film were so substantial, and the lead time before filming was so short, the makeup effects characters for the film were designed and created by three different companies: [[Tony Gardner (designer)|Tony Gardner's]] company [[Alterian, Inc.]], Steve Johnson's XFX, Inc., and Screaming Mad George's Studio.\n\n20th Century Fox had such high expectations for the film that they released a number of products based on it, including a line of action figures, a novelization and, most notably, a comic book released by Hamilton Comics (however, since the comic was drawn before most of the casting was completed, none of its characters look anything like their real-life counterparts).<ref name=officialsite/>\n\n===Complications===\nDuring filming, Joe Roth was fired as studio head by [[Rupert Murdoch]] and replaced with [[Peter Chernin]], who didn't like the film nor the fact that twelve million dollars was being invested in it.<ref name=officialsite/> Chernin cut the film's post-production budget, thus forcing a lot of the soundtrack (including a demo song that [[Iggy Pop]] had recorded for the closing credits) and special effects to be greatly cut down or eliminated altogether.<ref name=\"DVD Commentary\"/> The film's title was changed, as well, from the poorly received \"''Hideous Mutant Freekz''\" to the supposedly more accessible \"''Freaked''\", a title neither Winter nor Stern much cared for.\n\nAfter several poor test screenings, Fox chose to pull the film from a nationwide release and cut its advertising budget, leaving no money for commercials or newspaper ads.<ref name=\"Conversation\"/> ''Freaked'' had its official premiere at the [[Toronto International Film Festival]] on September 11, 1993. Despite initial positive critical response, the film opened October 3, 1993 in the United States on only two screens, making a mere $6,957 in its first weekend.<ref name=IMDB>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0109838/business|title=IMDb Business Statistics for 'Freaked'|accessdate=2007-09-21|author=IMDb.com|year=2005|publisher=}}</ref> It quickly dropped out of theatres, making less than $30,000 and becoming a failure at the box-office, and was released on [[VHS]] on April 20, 1994.\n\n==Reception==\n''Freaked'' received a mostly mixed response from critics.

The film was also nominated for a [[Saturn Award]] for Best Make-up.\n\n==Home media==\nOn July 12, 2005, [[Anchor Bay Entertainment]] and 20th Century Fox released a special-edition two-disc DVD, featuring extra material, including deleted scenes, audio commentary, behind-the-scenes footage and two short films from Alex Winter and Tom Stern, the 15-minute film noir parody ''Squeal Of Death'' and a black-and-white skit titled ''NYU Sight & Sound Project''. This DVD has since gone out of print.\n\nOn August 6, 2013, Anchor Bay and [[Starz Inc.]] re-released the movie on DVD and Blu-ray. This new release does not include any of the bonus features from the earlier, now out of print DVD.\n\n==Soundtrack==\nA soundtrack release for ''Freaked'' was planned, but following the loss of their post-production budget, the idea never came to fruition.

A bulb alone forces the water to flow up and over it forming a trough. Thus, if a bulb is added to a conventional bow at the proper position, the bulb trough coincides with the crest of the bow wave, and the two cancel out, reducing the vessel's [[wake]]. While inducing another wave stream saps energy from the ship, canceling out the second wave stream at the bow changes the pressure distribution along the hull, thereby reducing wave resistance. The effect that pressure distribution has on a surface is known as the [[form drag|form effect]].<ref name = Bowflows/>\n\nA sharp bow on a conventional hull form would produce waves and low drag like a bulbous bow, but waves coming from the side would strike it harder. The blunt bulbous bow also produces higher pressure in a large region in front, making the bow wave start earlier.<ref name = Bowflows/>\n\nThe addition of a bulb to a ship's hull increases its overall wetted area. As wetted area increases, so does drag. At greater speeds and in larger vessels it is the bow wave that is the greatest force impeding the vessel's forward motion through the water. For a vessel that is small or spends a great deal of its time at a slow speed, the increase in drag will not be offset by the benefit in damping bow wave generation. As the wave counter effects are only significant at the vessel's higher range of speed, bulbous bows are not energy efficient when the vessel cruises outside of these ranges, specifically at lower speeds.<ref name = Bowflows/>\n\nBulbous bows may be configured differently, according to the designed interaction between the bow wave and the countering wave from the bulb. Design parameters include a) upward curvature (a \"ram\" bulb) versus straight forward (a \"faired-in\" bulb), b) bulb position with respect to the waterline, and c) bulb volume.<ref name=\":1\" /> Bulbous bows also decrease a ship's [[Pitching moment|pitching motion]], when they are ballasted, by increasing the mass at a distance removed from the ship's longitudinal center of gravity.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n==Development==\n[[File:USS Lexington (CV-2) on building ways, 1925.jpg|thumb|The bulbous bow of the [[USS Lexington (CV-2)|USS ''Lexington'']] is visible on the left, while the vessel was under construction in 1925.]]\n\nTowing tests of warships had demonstrated that a below-water ram shape reduced resistance through the water before 1900.<ref name=\":2\" /> The bulbous bow concept is credited to [[David W. Taylor]], a naval architect who served as Chief Constructor of the [[United States Navy]] during the [[First World War]] and who used the concept (known as a bulbous forefoot) in his design of the {{USS|Delaware|BB-28|6}}, which entered service in 1910.

Still the idea was largely viewed as experimental by many ship builders and owners.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}\n\nIn 1935 the French superliner {{SS|Normandie|3=2}} was designed by [[Vladimir Yurkevich]] combining a bulbous forefoot with massive size and a redesigned hull shape. She was able to achieve speeds in excess of 30 knots (56&nbsp;km/h). ''Normandie'' was famous for many things, including her clean entry into the water and markedly reduced bow wave. ''Normandie''{{'}}s great rival, the British liner {{RMS|Queen Mary|3=2}}, achieved equivalent speeds using traditional stem and hull design.

A bulb alone forces the water to flow up and over it forming a trough. Thus, if a bulb is added to a conventional bow at the proper position, the bulb trough coincides with the crest of the bow wave, and the two cancel out, reducing the vessel's [[wake]]. While inducing another wave stream saps energy from the ship, canceling out the second wave stream at the bow changes the pressure distribution along the hull, thereby reducing wave resistance. The effect that pressure distribution has on a surface is known as the [[form drag|form effect]].<ref name = Bowflows/>\n\nA sharp bow on a conventional hull form would produce waves and low drag like a bulbous bow, but waves coming from the side would strike it harder. The blunt bulbous bow also produces higher pressure in a large region in front, making the bow wave start earlier.<ref name = Bowflows/>\n\nThe addition of a bulb to a ship's hull increases its overall wetted area. As wetted area increases, so does drag. At greater speeds and in larger vessels it is the bow wave that is the greatest force impeding the vessel's forward motion through the water. For a vessel that is small or spends a great deal of its time at a slow speed, the increase in drag will not be offset by the benefit in damping bow wave generation. As the wave counter effects are only significant at the vessel's higher range of speed, bulbous bows are not energy efficient when the vessel cruises outside of these ranges, specifically at lower speeds.<ref name = Bowflows/>\n\nBulbous bows may be configured differently, according to the designed interaction between the bow wave and the countering wave from the bulb. Design parameters include a) upward curvature (a \"ram\" bulb) versus straight forward (a \"faired-in\" bulb), b) bulb position with respect to the waterline, and c) bulb volume.<ref name=\":1\" /> Bulbous bows also decrease a ship's [[Pitching moment|pitching motion]], when they are ballasted, by increasing the mass at a distance removed from the ship's longitudinal center of gravity.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n==Development==\n[[File:USS Lexington (CV-2) on building ways, 1925.jpg|thumb|[[USS Lexington (CV-2)|USS ''Lexington'']] displays her bulbous bow (toward right) in 1925]]\n\nTowing tests of warships had demonstrated that a below-water ram shape reduced resistance through the water before 1900.<ref name=\":2\" /> The bulbous bow concept is credited to [[David W.

It is typically officially authorized and maintained by a [[sovereign state]], with its members identifiable by their distinct [[military uniform]]. It may consist of one or more [[military branch]]es such as an [[army]], [[navy]], [[air force]], [[space force]], [[marines]], or [[coast guard]]. The main task of the military is usually defined as defence of the state and its interests against external armed threats.\n\nIn broad usage, the terms \"armed forces\" and \"military\" are often treated as synonymous, although in technical usage a distinction is sometimes made in which a country's armed forces may include both its military and other [[paramilitary]] forces. There are various forms of [[irregular military]] forces, not belonging to a recognized state; though they share many attributes with regular military forces, they are less often referred to as simply \"military\".\n\n[[File:Countries by soldier count.svg|thumb|upright=1.6|Countries by number of active soldiers (2009)]]\n\nA nation's military may function as a discrete social [[subculture]], with dedicated infrastructure such as military housing, schools, utilities, [[logistics]], hospitals, legal services, food production, finance, and banking services. Beyond warfare, the military may be employed in additional sanctioned and non-sanctioned functions within the state, including internal security threats, [[population control]], the promotion of a [[political agenda]], [[emergency service]]s and reconstruction, protecting [[corporate]] economic interests, social ceremonies and national honor guards.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Jordan |first1=David |last2=Kiras |first2=James D. |last3=Lonsdale |first3=David J. |last4=Speller |first4=Ian |last5=Tuck |first5=Christopher |last6=Walton |first6=C.

However, at about the time of the [[Napoleonic Wars]], 'military' began to be used in reference to armed forces as a whole, such as '[[military service]]', '[[military intelligence]]', and '[[military history]]'. As such, it now connotes any activity performed by armed force personnel.<ref name=\"OED\"/>\n\n==History==\n{{Main|Military history}}\n{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2011}}\n\nMilitary history is often considered to be the history of all conflicts, not just the history of the state militaries. It differs somewhat from the [[history of war]], with military history focusing on the people and institutions of war-making, while the history of war focuses on the evolution of war itself in the face of changing technology, governments, and geography.\n\nMilitary history has a number of facets. One main facet is to learn from past accomplishments and mistakes, so as to more effectively wage war in the future. Another is to create a sense of [[military tradition]], which is used to create cohesive military forces. Still, another may be to learn to prevent wars more effectively. Human knowledge about the military is largely based on both recorded and [[oral history]] of military conflicts (war), their participating [[army|armies]] and [[navy|navies]] and, more recently, [[air force]]s.\n\nThere are two types of military history, although almost all texts have elements of both: descriptive history, that serves to chronicle conflicts without offering any statements about the [[Causes of war#Historical causes of wars|causes]], [[Causes of war#Conduct of wars|nature of conduct]], the ending, and [[Causes of war#Effects of war|effects]] of a conflict; and [[military history (analytical)|analytical history]], that seeks to offer statements about the causes, nature, ending, and aftermath of conflicts \u2013 as a means of deriving knowledge and understanding of conflicts as a whole, and prevent repetition of mistakes in future, to suggest better concepts or methods in employing forces, or to advocate the need for new technology.\n\n==Organization==\n{{further|Military organization}}\n[[File:GCCMAP_2019.png|thumb|upright=1.35|An example of military command; a map of the United States' Unified Combatant Command's area of responsibility.]]\n\n===Personnel and units===\n{{main|Military personnel}}\n{{See also|Military reserve|Military service}}\n\n[[File:CF-18A launches LGB Eglin AFB 2006.JPG|thumb|Canadian [[CF-18 Hornet]] drops a laser-guided bomb]]\n\nDespite the growing importance of [[military technology]], military activity depends above all on people. For example, in 2000 the British Army declared: \"Man is still the first weapon of war.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/395358/2000-ADPvol5_Soldiering_the_Military_Covenant_Ver2.pdf|title=Soldiering: The military covenant|last=British Army|date=2000|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|url-status= |access-date=2017-12-13}}</ref>\n\n==== Rank and role ====\nThe military organization is characterized by a strict [[command hierarchy]] divided by [[military rank]], with ranks normally grouped (in descending order of authority) as [[Officer (armed forces)|officers]] (e.g. [[Colonel]]), [[non-commissioned officer]]s (e.g. [[Sergeant]]), and personnel at the lowest rank (e.g. [[Private (rank)|Private Soldier]]). While senior officers make strategic decisions, subordinated military personnel ([[soldier]]s, [[sailor]]s, [[marine (military)|marines]], or [[airmen]]) fulfil them. Although rank titles vary by [[military branch]] and country, the rank hierarchy is common to all state armed forces worldwide.\n\nIn addition to their rank, personnel occupy one of many trade roles, which are often grouped according to the nature of the role's military task on combat operations: [[combat]] roles (e.g. [[infantry]]), [[combat support]] roles (e.g. [[combat engineer]]s), and [[combat service support]] roles (e.g. logistical support).\n\n==== Recruitment ====\n{{Main|Military recruitment}}\n\nPersonnel may be [[Military recruitment|recruited]] or [[Conscription|conscripted]], depending on the system chosen by the state.

For this purpose, some of the commanding forces and other military, as well as often civilian personnel participate in identification of these threats. This is at once an organisation, a system and a process collectively called [[military intelligence]] (MI).\n\nThe difficulty in using military intelligence concepts and military intelligence methods is in the nature of the [[Information security|secrecy]] of the information they seek, and the [[clandestine operation|clandestine]] nature that intelligence operatives work in obtaining what may be plans for a [[conflict escalation]], [[Phase (combat)|initiation of combat]], or an [[invasion]].\n\nAn important part of the military intelligence role is the military analysis performed to assess [[military capability]] of potential future aggressors, and provide combat modelling that helps to understand factors on which comparison of forces can be made. This helps to quantify and qualify such statements as: \"[[People's Liberation Army|China]] and [[Military of India|India]] maintain the largest armed forces in the World\" or that \"the [[U.S. Military]] is considered to be the world's strongest\".<ref>[http://www.statista.com/statistics/220318/opinion-of-americans-on-the-us-being-the-no1-military-power-in-the-world/ Statistics on Americans' opinion about the U.S. being the world's no1 military power], Gallup, March 2012.

They also use these terms to conceal from the MI their true capabilities, and to impress potential ideological recruits.\n\nHaving military intelligence representatives participate in the execution of the national defence policy is important, because it becomes the first respondent and commentator on the policy expected [[strategic goal (military)|strategic goal]], compared to the realities of [[Intelligence (information gathering)|identified threats]]. When the intelligence reporting is compared to the policy, it becomes possible for the national leadership to consider allocating resources over and above the officers and their subordinates military pay, and the expense of maintaining military facilities and military support services for them.\n\n===Economics===\n{{Main|Military budget}}\n\n[[File:Military Expenditures as percent of GDP 2017.png|thumb|upright=1.5|Map of military expenditures as a percentage of [[gross domestic product|GDP]] by country, 2017.<ref>'''2017''' data from: {{cite web  |url=http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/MS.MIL.XPND.GD.ZS|title=Military expenditure (% of GDP).

Military procurement is then authorised to purchase or contract provision of goods and services to the military, whether in peacetime at a permanent base, or in a combat zone from local population.\n\n===Capability development===\n{{update|section|reason=a more recent military ranking should be added|date=January 2020}}\nCapability development, which is often referred to as the military 'strength', is arguably one of the most complex activities known to humanity; because it requires determining: strategic, operational, and tactical capability requirements to counter the identified threats; strategic, [[Operational doctrine|operational]], and tactical doctrines by which the acquired capabilities will be used; identifying concepts, methods, and systems involved in executing the doctrines; creating design specifications for the manufacturers who would produce these in adequate quantity and quality for their use in combat; purchase the concepts, methods, and systems; create a forces structure that would use the concepts, methods, and systems most effectively and efficiently; integrate these concepts, methods, and systems into the force structure by providing [[military education]], [[military training|training]], and [[Military exercise|practice]] that preferably resembles combat environment of intended use; create [[military logistics]] systems to allow continued and uninterrupted performance of [[military organisation]]s under combat conditions, including provision of health services to the personnel, and maintenance for the equipment; the services to assist recovery of wounded personnel, and repair of damaged equipment; and finally, post-conflict [[demobilisation]], and disposal of war stocks surplus to peacetime requirements.\n\nDevelopment of [[military doctrine]] is perhaps the more important of all capability development activities, because it determines how military forces were, and are used in conflicts, the concepts and methods used by the command to employ appropriately military skilled, [[soldier|armed]] and [[military equipment|equipped]] personnel in achievement of the tangible goals and objectives of the [[war]], [[military campaign|campaign]], [[battle]], engagement, action or a [[duel]].<ref name=\"p.67, Dupuy\">Dupuy, T.N.

The use of forces at the level of organisation between strategic and tactical is called [[operational mobility]].\n\nThere have been attempts to produce a military strength index: this is an example taken from a [[Credit Suisse]] report in September 2015.<ref name=\"CreditSuisse2015\">{{cite report|url=http://publications.credit-suisse.com/tasks/render/file/index.cfm?fileid=EE7A6A5D-D9D5-6204-E9E6BB426B47D054|title=The End of Globalization or a more Multipolar World?|publisher=[[Credit Suisse]] AG|first1=Michael|last1=O\u2019Sullivan|first2=Krithika|last2=Subramanian|date=2015-10-17|accessdate=2017-07-14|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180215235711/http://publications.credit-suisse.com/tasks/render/file/index.cfm?fileid=EE7A6A5D-D9D5-6204-E9E6BB426B47D054|archivedate=15 February 2018|url-status=dead}}</ref> The factors under consideration for that military strength indicator and their total weights were: number of active personnel in the armed forces (5%), tanks (10%), attack helicopters (15%), aircraft (20%), aircraft carriers (25%), and submarines (25%).

Military scientists are therefore found to interact with all Arms and Services of the armed forces, and at all levels of the military hierarchy of command.\n\nAlthough concerned with research into [[military psychology]], particularly [[Combat stress reaction|combat stress]] and how it affect troop [[morale]], often the bulk of military science activities is directed at military intelligence technology, [[military communications]], and improving [[military capability]] through research. The design, development, and prototyping of [[weapon]]s, military support equipment, and [[military technology]] in general, is also an area in which lots of effort is invested \u2013 it includes everything from global communication networks and [[aircraft carrier]]s to paint and food.\n\n===Logistics===\n{{Main|Military logistics}}\n{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2017}}\n[[File:C-1Transport aircraft02.jpg|thumb|The [[Kawasaki C-1]] is a tactical military transport of the [[Japan Air Self-Defense Force]]]]\n[[File:Convoy Red Ball Express.jpg|thumb|[[Red Ball Express]] convoy in [[France]]]]\nPossessing military capability is not sufficient if this capability cannot be deployed for, and employed in combat operations. To achieve this, [[military logistics]] are used for the [[logistics management]] and logistics planning of the forces [[military supply chain management]], the consumables, and capital equipment of the troops.\n\nAlthough mostly concerned with the [[military transport]], as a means of delivery using different modes of transport; from [[military truck]]s, to [[container ship]]s operating from permanent [[military base]], it also involves creating field supply dumps at the rear of the [[combat]] zone, and even forward supply points in specific unit's [[Tactical Area of Responsibility]].\n\nThese supply points are also used to provide [[military engineering]] services, such as the recovery of defective and derelict vehicles and weapons, maintenance of weapons in the field, the repair and field modification of weapons and equipment; and in peacetime, the life-extension programmes undertaken to allow continued use of equipment. One of the most important role of logistics is the supply of [[munition]]s as a primary type of consumable, their storage, and [[Ordnance disposal|disposal]].\n\n==In combat==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2017}}\nThe primary reason for the existence of the military is to engage in [[combat]], should it be required to do so by the national defence policy, and to win. This represents an organisational goal of any military, and the primary focus for military thought through [[military history]]. How [[victory]] is achieved, and what shape it assumes, is studied by most, if not all, military groups on three levels.\n\n===Strategic victory===\n{{Main|Strategic victory}}\n[[File:Mahratta pirates attacking the sloop 'Aurora', of the Bombay Marine, 1812; end of the action RMG BHC1085.tiff|thumb|The [[Maratha Navy]], which is considered to be the foundation of the modern [[Indian Navy]], often employed land and sea coordination tactics when attacking, which won them many battles against the [[Mughal Empire|Mughals]] and [[Portuguese Empire|Portuguese]]]]\n{{more citations needed section|date=March 2017}}\n\n[[Military strategy]] is the management of forces in [[war]]s and [[military campaign]]s by a [[commander-in-chief]], employing large military forces, either national and allied as a whole, or the component elements of [[Army|armies]], [[Navy|navies]] and [[air force]]s; such as [[army group]]s, [[naval fleet]]s, and large numbers of [[aircraft]]. Military strategy is a long-term projection of belligerents' policy, with a broad view of outcome implications, including outside the concerns of military command. Military strategy is more concerned with the [[logistics|supply of war]] and planning, than management of field forces and combat between them. The scope of strategic military planning can span weeks, but is more often months or even years.<ref name=\"p.67, Dupuy\"/>\n\n[[File:Crowd of Dutch civilians celebrating the liberation of Utrecht by the Canadian Army.jpg|thumb|Dutch civilians celebrating the arrival of the [[I Canadian Corps]] in [[Utrecht]] as the [[Canadian Army]] liberates the Netherlands from Nazi occupation]]\n\n===Operational victory===\n{{more citations needed section|date=March 2017}}\n\n[[Operational mobility]] is, within [[war]]fare and [[military doctrine]], the level of command which coordinates the minute details of [[military tactics|tactics]] with the overarching goals of [[strategy]]. A common synonym is operational art.\n\nThe operational level is at a scale bigger than one where line of sight and the time of day are important, and smaller than the strategic level, where production and politics are considerations. Formations are of the operational level if they are able to conduct operations on their own, and are of sufficient size to be directly handled or have a significant impact at the strategic level. This concept was pioneered by the [[Germany|German]] army prior to and during the [[World War II|Second World War]]. At this level, planning and duration of activities takes from one week to a month, and are executed by [[Field Army|Field Armies]] and [[Army Corps]] and their naval and air equivalents.<ref name=\"p.67, Dupuy\"/>\n\n===Tactical victory===\n{{Main|Tactical victory}}\n{{more citations needed section|date=March 2017}}\n\n[[Military tactics]] concerns itself with the methods for engaging and defeating the enemy in direct combat. Military tactics are usually used by units over hours or days, and are focused on the specific, close proximity tasks and objectives of [[squadron (army)|squadrons]], [[Company (military unit)|companies]], [[battalion]]s, [[regiment]]s, [[brigade]]s, and [[Division (military)|divisions]], and their naval and air force equivalents.<ref name=\"p.67, Dupuy\"/>\n\nOne of the oldest military publications is ''[[The Art of War]]'', by the [[List of Chinese philosophers|Chinese philosopher]] [[Sun Tzu]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mypivots.com/articles/booktext.aspx?bookname=The%20Art%20of%20War|title=The Art of War|website=Mypivots.com|publisher= |date=11 June 2011|accessdate=1 August 2011}}</ref> Written in the 6th century BCE, the 13-chapter book is intended as military instruction, and not as [[military theory]], but has had a huge influence on Asian military doctrine, and from the late 19th century, on European and United States [[military plan]]ning. It has even been used to formulate business tactics, and can even be applied in social and political areas.{{Where|date=July 2011}}\n\n[[File:Macedonian battle formation-en.svg|thumb|Battle formation and tactics of [[Macedon]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.westpoint.edu/history/SitePages/Home.aspx |title=Welcome to the Department of History|website=westpoint.edu|publisher= |accessdate=1 August 2011}}</ref>]]\n\nThe Classical Greeks and the Romans wrote prolifically on [[military campaign]]ing. Among the best-known Roman works are [[Julius Caesar]]'s commentaries on the [[Gallic Wars]], and the [[Caesar's civil war|Roman Civil war]] \u2013 written about 50 BC.\n\nTwo major works on tactics come from the late Roman period: ''Taktike Theoria'' by [[Aelianus Tacticus]], and ''[[De Re Militari]]'' ('On military matters') by [[Publius Flavius Vegetius Renatus|Vegetius]]. ''Taktike Theoria'' examined Greek military tactics, and was most influential in the [[Byzantine]] world and during the [[Islamic Golden Age|Golden Age of Islam]].\n\n''De Re Militari'' formed the basis of European military tactics until the late 17th century. Perhaps its most enduring maxim is [[Si vis pacem, para bellum|''Igitur qui desiderat pacem, praeparet bellum'']] (let he who desires peace prepare for war).\n\nDue to the changing nature of combat with the introduction of [[artillery]] in the European [[Middle Ages]], and infantry firearms in the [[Renaissance]], attempts were made to define and identify those strategies, [[grand tactics]], and tactics that would produce a victory more often than that achieved by the Romans in praying to the gods before the battle.\n\nLater this became known as [[military science]], and later still, would adopt the [[scientific method]] approach to the conduct of military operations under the influence of the [[Industrial Revolution]] thinking. In his seminal book ''[[On War]]'', the [[Prussia]]n [[Major-General]] and leading [[expert]] on modern [[military strategy]], [[Carl von Clausewitz]] defined military strategy as 'the employment of battles to gain the end of war'.<ref>{{cite book|last=MacHenry|first=Robert|title=The New Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica|journal=Chicago: Encyclopaedia Britannica Inc|origyear= |accessdate= |edition= |series= |year=1993|isbn= |oclc= |doi= |id= |page=305|chapter= |quote= |bibcode=1991neb..book.....G}}</ref> According to Clausewitz: <blockquote>\nstrategy forms the plan of the War, and to this end it links together the series of acts which are to lead to the final decision, that is to say, it makes the plans for the separate campaigns and regulates the combats to be fought in each.<ref>{{cite book|url=http://www.Gutenberg.org/files/1946/1946-h/1946-h.htm#2H_4_0023|title=''On War'' by General Carl von Clausewitz|accessdate=31 May 2007|website=Gutenberg.org|publisher= |date=2006-02-26}}</ref>\n</blockquote>\nHence, Clausewitz placed political aims above [[Strategic goal (military)|military goals]], ensuring [[civilian control of the military]]. Military strategy was one of a triumvirate of '[[Military art (Military science)|arts]]' or 'sciences' that governed the conduct of warfare, the others being: [[military tactics]], the execution of plans and [[Operational mobility|manoeuvring of forces in battle]], and maintenance of an army.\n\nThe meaning of military tactics has changed over time; from the deployment and manoeuvring of entire land armies on the fields of ancient battles, and galley fleets; to modern use of small unit [[ambush]]es, [[encirclement]]s, [[bombardment]] attacks, [[frontal assault]]s, [[air assault]]s, [[hit-and-run tactics]] used mainly by [[guerrilla]] forces, and, in some cases, [[suicide attack]]s on land and at sea. Evolution of [[aerial warfare]] introduced its own [[Air combat manoeuvring|air combat tactics]]. Often, [[military deception]], in the form of [[military camouflage]] or misdirection using [[decoy]]s, is used to confuse the enemy as a tactic.\n\nA major development in [[infantry tactics]] came with the increased use of [[trench warfare]] in the 19th and 20th centuries. This was mainly employed in [[World War I]] in the [[Battle of Gallipoli|Gallipoli campaign]], and the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]]. Trench warfare often turned to a stalemate, only broken by a large loss of life, because, in order to attack an enemy entrenchment, soldiers had to run through an exposed '[[no man's land]]' under heavy fire from their opposing entrenched enemy.\n\n==Technology==\n{{Main|Military technology}}\n{{More citations needed section|date=October 2014}}\n\n[[File:Arrow-head Olynthus BM GR1912.4-19.4.jpg|thumb|[[Arrow-head]]. Bronze, 4th century BC. From [[Olynthus]], [[Chalcidice]].]]\nAs with any occupation, since the ancient times, the military has been distinguished from other members of the society by their tools, the military weapons, and [[military equipment]] used in combat. When [[Stone Age]] humans first took a sliver of flint to tip the [[spear]], it was the first example of [[applied research|applying technology]] to improve the weapon.\n\nSince then, the advances made by human societies, and that of weapons, has been irretrievably linked. Stone weapons gave way to [[Bronze Age]] weapons, and later, the [[Iron Age]] weapons. With each technological change, was realised some tangible increase in military capability, such as through greater effectiveness of a sharper edge in defeating [[leather armour]], or [[Mechanics of materials|improved density of materials]] used in manufacture of weapons.\n\nOn [[Land warfare|land]], the first really significant technological advance in warfare was the development of the [[ranged weapon]]s, and notably, the [[Sling (weapon)|sling]]. The next significant advance came with the [[domestication of the horse]]s and mastering of [[equestrianism]].\n[[File:Caballero Armadura 4 Alcazar Segovia 2010.jpg|thumb|Mounted [[armour]]ed [[knight]]. Armour and [[cavalry]] dominated the battlefield, until the invention of [[firearms]].]]\n\nArguably, the greatest invention that affected not just the military, but all society, after adoption of fire, was the [[wheel]], and its use in the construction of the [[chariot]]. There were no advances in military technology, until, from the mechanical arm action of a slinger, the [[Ancient Greece|Greeks]], [[Egyptians]], [[Roman Empire|Romans]], [[Persia]]ns, [[History of China#Ancient China|Chinese]], etc., developed the [[siege engine]]s. The [[Bow (weapon)|bow]] was manufactured in increasingly larger and more powerful versions, to increase both the weapon range, and armour penetration performance. These developed into the powerful composite and recurve bows, and crossbows of [[History of China#Ancient China|Ancient China]]. These proved particularly useful during the rise of cavalry, as horsemen encased in ever-more sophisticated [[armour]] came to dominate the battlefield.\n\nSomewhat earlier, in medieval China, [[gunpowder]] had been invented, and was increasingly used by the military in combat. The use of gunpowder in the early [[mortar (weapon)|vase-like mortars]] in Europe, and advanced versions of the [[long bow]] and [[cross bow]], which all had armour-piercing [[arrowhead]]s, that put an end to the dominance of the armoured knight. After the long bow, which required great skill and strength to use, the next most significant technological advance was the [[musket]], which could be used effectively, with little training. In time, the successors to muskets and [[cannon]], in the form of [[rifle]]s and [[artillery]], would become core battlefield technology.\n\nAs the speed of technological advances accelerated in civilian applications, so too warfare became more [[Industrial warfare|industrialised]]. The newly invented [[machine gun]] and [[repeating rifle]] redefined [[firepower]] on the battlefield, and, in part, explains the high casualty rates of the [[American Civil War]]. The next breakthrough was the conversion of artillery parks from the [[Muzzleloader|muzzle loading guns]], to the quicker loading [[Breech-loading weapon|breech loading guns]] with recoiling barrel that allowed quicker aimed fire and use of a shield. The widespread introduction of low smoke (smokeless) propellant powders since the 1880s also allowed for a great improvement of artillery ranges.\n\nThe development of breech loading had the greatest effect on [[naval warfare]], for the first time since the Middle Ages, altering the way weapons are mounted on [[warship]]s, and therefore [[naval tactics]], now divorced from the reliance on [[Age of Sail|sails]] with the invention of the [[internal combustion]]. A further advance in military naval technology was the design of the [[submarine]], and its weapon, the [[torpedo]].\n\n[[Main battle tank]]s, and other heavy equipment such as [[armoured fighting vehicle]]s, [[military aircraft]], and [[ship]]s, are characteristic to organised military forces.\n\nDuring [[World War I]], the need to break the deadlock of trench warfare saw the rapid development of many new technologies, particularly [[tank]]s. [[Military aviation]] was extensively used, and [[bomber]]s became decisive in many battles of [[World War II]], which marked the most frantic period of weapons development in history. Many new designs, and concepts were used in combat, and all existing technologies of warfare were improved between 1939 and 1945.\n\nDuring the war, significant advances were made in [[military communications]] through increased use of radio, military intelligence through use of the [[radar]], and in [[military medicine]] through use of [[penicillin]], while in the air, the guided [[missile]], [[jet aircraft]], and [[helicopter]]s were seen for the first time. Perhaps the most infamous of all military technologies was the creation of the [[atomic bomb]], although the exact effects of its [[radiation]] were unknown until the early 1950s. Far greater use of [[military vehicles]] had finally eliminated the cavalry from the military [[force structure]].\n[[File:USAF F-15C fires AIM-7 Sparrow.jpg|thumb|[[AIM-7]] Sparrow medium range [[air-to-air missile]] from an [[F-15 Eagle]]]]\n\nAfter World War II, with the onset of the [[Cold War]], the constant technological development of new weapons was institutionalised, as participants engaged in a constant '[[arms race]]' in capability development. This constant state of weapons development continues into the present, and remains a constant drain on national resources, which some{{Who|date=March 2017}} blame on the [[military-industrial complex]].\n\nThe most significant technological developments that influenced combat have been the guided missiles, which can be used by all branches of the armed services. More recently, [[information technology]], and its use in [[surveillance]], including space-based reconnaissance systems, have played an increasing role in military operations.\n\nThe impact of [[information warfare]] that focuses on attacking command communication systems, and military databases, has been coupled with the new development in military technology, has been the use of robotic systems in intelligence combat, both in hardware and software applications.\n\nRecently, there has also been a particular focus towards the use of [[renewable fuels]] for running military vehicles on. Unlike fossil fuels, renewable fuels can be produced in any country, creating a strategic advantage. The [[US military]] has already committed itself to have 50% of its energy consumption come from alternative sources.<ref>{{cite web|author=Craig Hooper|url=http://NextNavy.com/air-force-cedes-the-green-lead-and-the-lede-to-navy/|title=Ray Mabus greening the military|website=NextNavy.com|publisher= |date= |accessdate=22 May 2012}}</ref>\n\n==As part of society==\n{{More citations needed section|date=October 2014}}\n[[File:Samurai and Ainu Fuzoku Ema.jpg|thumb|[[Samurai]], member of the Japanese warrior caste]]\nFor much of [[military history]], the armed forces were considered to be for use by the heads of their societies, until recently, the crowned heads of states. In a democracy or other political system run in the public interest, it is a [[public force]].\n\nThe relationship between the military and the [[society]] it serves is a complicated and ever-evolving one. Much depends on the nature of the society itself, and whether it sees the military as important, as for example in time of threat or war, or a burdensome expense typified by defence cuts in time of peace.\n\nOne difficult matter in the relation between military and society is control and transparency. In some countries, limited information on military operations and budgeting is accessible for the public. However transparency in the military sector is crucial to fight [[corruption]]. This showed the [[Government Defence Anti-corruption Index]] [[Transparency International|Transparency International UK]] published in 2013.<ref>{{cite web|title=Transparency is feasible|author=Pyman, Mark|url=https://www.DandC.eu/en/article/transparency-international-assesses-82-governments-defence-related-corruption-risks-first|website=www.DandC.eu|publisher=[[D+C Development and Cooperation]], Engagement GlobalGmbH|date=5 March 2013|accessdate=2 March 2017}}</ref>\n\nMilitaries often function as [[society|societies]] within societies, by having their own military communities, [[Military-industrial complex|economies]], [[Military education and training|education]], [[military medicine|medicine]], and other aspects of a functioning [[civil society|civilian society]]. Although a 'military' is not limited to nations in of itself as many [[private military companies]] (or PMC's) can be used or 'hired' by organisations and figures as security, escort, or other means of protection; where police, agencies, or militaries are absent or not trusted.\n\n===Ideology and ethics===\n{{Main|Militarism}}\n{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2017}}\n[[File:Gustavus Adolphus in action (probably at L\u00fctzen).jpg|thumb|Swedish king [[Gustavus Adolphus]] leading a cavalry charge, 1634]]\nMilitarist ideology is the [[society]]'s [[social attitude]] of being best served, or being a beneficiary of a [[government]], or guided by concepts embodied in the military ''culture, doctrine, system'', or ''leaders''.\n\nEither because of the [[cultural memory]], national history, or the potentiality of a [[military threat]], the militarist argument asserts that a [[civilian]] population is dependent upon, and thereby subservient to the needs and goals of its military for continued [[independence]]. [[Militarism]] is sometimes contrasted with the concepts of [[comprehensive national power]], [[soft power]] and [[hard power]].\n\nMost nations have separate [[military law]]s which regulate conduct in war and during peacetime. An early exponent was [[Hugo Grotius]], whose ''[[De jure belli ac pacis|On the Law of War and Peace]]'' (1625) had a major impact of the humanitarian approach to warfare development. His theme was echoed by [[Gustavus Adolphus]].\n\nEthics of warfare have developed since 1945, to create constraints on the military treatment of prisoners and civilians, primarily by the [[Geneva Conventions]]; but rarely apply to use of the military forces as internal security troops during times of political conflict that results in popular protests and incitement to [[popular uprising]].\n\nInternational protocols restrict the use, or have even created international bans on some types of weapons, notably [[weapons of mass destruction]] (WMD). [[International convention]]s define what constitutes a [[war crime]], and provides for war crimes prosecution. Individual countries also have elaborate codes of [[military justice]], an example being the United States' [[Uniform Code of Military Justice]] that can lead to [[court martial]] for military personnel found guilty of war crimes.\n\nMilitary actions are sometimes argued to be justified by furthering a humanitarian cause, such as [[disaster relief]] operations, or in defence of refugees. The term [[military humanism]] is used to refer to such actions.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|War}}\n{{-}}\n{{colbegin|colwidth=20em}}<!-- list contains terms that should actually be worked into the main article -->\n* [[Arms industry]]\n* [[Civil defense]]\n* [[Civilian control of the military]]\n* [[Command and control]]\n* [[Conscription]]\n* [[Court-martial]]\n* [[Deterrence theory]]\n* [[Martial arts]]\n* [[Martial law]]\n* [[Mercenary]]\n* [[Militaria]]\n* [[Military academy]]\n* [[Military advisor]]\n* [[Military aid]]\n* [[Military aid to the civil community]] (MACC)\n* [[Military aid to the civil power]] (MACP)\n* [[Military alliance]]\n* [[Military dictatorship]]\n* [[Military district]]\n* [[Military engineering]]\n* [[Military exercise]]\n* [[Military fiat]]\n* [[Military incompetence]]\n* [[Military junta]]\n* [[Military meteorology]]\n* [[Military operations other than war]]\n* [[Military police]]\n* [[Military prison]]\n* [[Military Revolution]]\n* [[Military sociology]]\n* [[Military terminology]]\n* [[Military\u2013industrial complex]]\n* [[Militarization of police]]\n* [[Militia]]\n* [[Ministry of Defence|Ministry/Department of Defence]]\n* [[Mobilization]]\n* [[Police]]\n* [[Private military company]]\n* [[Recruit training]]\n* [[Staff (military)]]\n* [[Standing army]]\n* [[Weapon]]\n{{colend}}\n\n; Armed forces of the world\n* [[List of countries by number of military and paramilitary personnel]]\n* [[List of countries by Military Strength Index]]\n* [[List of countries by level of military equipment]]\n* [[List of countries by Global Militarization Index]]\n* [[List of countries without armed forces]]\n* [[List of countries by military expenditures]]\n* [[List of countries by past military expenditure]]\n* [[List of countries by military expenditure per capita]]\n* [[List of air forces]]\n* [[List of armies]]\n* [[List of navies]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Sister project links|military}}\n* [http://lebanese-economy-forum.com/wdi-gdf-advanced-data-display/show/MS-MIL-XPND-GD-ZS/ Military Expenditure % of GDP] hosted by Lebanese economy forum, extracted from the World Bank public data.\n* {{curlie|Society/Military}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Military| ]]\n[[Category:Defense]]\n[[Category:Government institutions]]\n[[Category:International security]]\n[[Category:National security]]\n[[Category:Main topic articles]]\n", "text_old": "{{hatnote |For the film, see [[Military (film)]].

The main task of the military is usually defined as defence of the state and its interests against external armed threats.\n\nIn broad usage, the terms \"armed forces\" and \"military\" are often treated as synonymous, although in technical usage a distinction is sometimes made in which a country's armed forces may include both its military and other [[paramilitary]] forces. There are various forms of [[irregular military]] forces, not belonging to a recognized state; though they share many attributes with regular military forces, they are less often referred to as simply \"military\".\n\n[[File:Countries by soldier count.svg|thumb|upright=1.6|Countries by number of active soldiers (2009)]]\n\nA nation's military may function as a discrete social [[subculture]], with dedicated infrastructure such as military housing, schools, utilities, [[logistics]], hospitals, legal services, food production, finance, and banking services. Beyond warfare, the military may be employed in additional sanctioned and non-sanctioned functions within the state, including internal security threats, [[population control]], the promotion of a [[political agenda]], [[emergency service]]s and reconstruction, protecting [[corporate]] economic interests, social ceremonies and national honor guards.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Jordan |first1=David |last2=Kiras |first2=James D. |last3=Lonsdale |first3=David J. |last4=Speller |first4=Ian |last5=Tuck |first5=Christopher |last6=Walton |first6=C.

However, at about the time of the [[Napoleonic Wars]], 'military' began to be used in reference to armed forces as a whole, such as '[[military service]]', '[[military intelligence]]', and '[[military history]]'. As such, it now connotes any activity performed by armed force personnel.<ref name=\"OED\"/>\n\n==History==\n{{Main|Military history}}\n{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2011}}\n\nMilitary history is often considered to be the history of all conflicts, not just the history of the state militaries. It differs somewhat from the [[history of war]], with military history focusing on the people and institutions of war-making, while the history of war focuses on the evolution of war itself in the face of changing technology, governments, and geography.\n\nMilitary history has a number of facets. One main facet is to learn from past accomplishments and mistakes, so as to more effectively wage war in the future. Another is to create a sense of [[military tradition]], which is used to create cohesive military forces. Still, another may be to learn to prevent wars more effectively. Human knowledge about the military is largely based on both recorded and [[oral history]] of military conflicts (war), their participating [[army|armies]] and [[navy|navies]] and, more recently, [[air force]]s.\n\nThere are two types of military history, although almost all texts have elements of both: descriptive history, that serves to chronicle conflicts without offering any statements about the [[Causes of war#Historical causes of wars|causes]], [[Causes of war#Conduct of wars|nature of conduct]], the ending, and [[Causes of war#Effects of war|effects]] of a conflict; and [[military history (analytical)|analytical history]], that seeks to offer statements about the causes, nature, ending, and aftermath of conflicts \u2013 as a means of deriving knowledge and understanding of conflicts as a whole, and prevent repetition of mistakes in future, to suggest better concepts or methods in employing forces, or to advocate the need for new technology.\n\n==Organization==\n{{further|Military organization}}\n[[File:GCCMAP_2019.png|thumb|upright=1.35|An example of military command; a map of the United States' Unified Combatant Command's area of responsibility.]]\n\n===Personnel and units===\n{{main|Military personnel}}\n{{See also|Military reserve|Military service}}\n\n[[File:CF-18A launches LGB Eglin AFB 2006.JPG|thumb|Canadian [[CF-18 Hornet]] drops a laser-guided bomb]]\n\nDespite the growing importance of [[military technology]], military activity depends above all on people. For example, in 2000 the British Army declared: \"Man is still the first weapon of war.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/395358/2000-ADPvol5_Soldiering_the_Military_Covenant_Ver2.pdf|title=Soldiering: The military covenant|last=British Army|date=2000|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|url-status= |access-date=2017-12-13}}</ref>\n\n==== Rank and role ====\nThe military organization is characterized by a strict [[command hierarchy]] divided by [[military rank]], with ranks normally grouped (in descending order of authority) as [[Officer (armed forces)|officers]] (e.g. [[Colonel]]), [[non-commissioned officer]]s (e.g. [[Sergeant]]), and personnel at the lowest rank (e.g. [[Private (rank)|Private Soldier]]). While senior officers make strategic decisions, subordinated military personnel ([[soldier]]s, [[sailor]]s, [[marine (military)|marines]], or [[airmen]]) fulfil them. Although rank titles vary by [[military branch]] and country, the rank hierarchy is common to all state armed forces worldwide.\n\nIn addition to their rank, personnel occupy one of many trade roles, which are often grouped according to the nature of the role's military task on combat operations: [[combat]] roles (e.g. [[infantry]]), [[combat support]] roles (e.g. [[combat engineer]]s), and [[combat service support]] roles (e.g. logistical support).\n\n==== Recruitment ====\n{{Main|Military recruitment}}\n\nPersonnel may be [[Military recruitment|recruited]] or [[Conscription|conscripted]], depending on the system chosen by the state.

For this purpose, some of the commanding forces and other military, as well as often civilian personnel participate in identification of these threats. This is at once an organisation, a system and a process collectively called [[military intelligence]] (MI).\n\nThe difficulty in using military intelligence concepts and military intelligence methods is in the nature of the [[Information security|secrecy]] of the information they seek, and the [[clandestine operation|clandestine]] nature that intelligence operatives work in obtaining what may be plans for a [[conflict escalation]], [[Phase (combat)|initiation of combat]], or an [[invasion]].\n\nAn important part of the military intelligence role is the military analysis performed to assess [[military capability]] of potential future aggressors, and provide combat modelling that helps to understand factors on which comparison of forces can be made. This helps to quantify and qualify such statements as: \"[[People's Liberation Army|China]] and [[Military of India|India]] maintain the largest armed forces in the World\" or that \"the [[U.S. Military]] is considered to be the world's strongest\".<ref>[http://www.statista.com/statistics/220318/opinion-of-americans-on-the-us-being-the-no1-military-power-in-the-world/ Statistics on Americans' opinion about the U.S. being the world's no1 military power], Gallup, March 2012.

They also use these terms to conceal from the MI their true capabilities, and to impress potential ideological recruits.\n\nHaving military intelligence representatives participate in the execution of the national defence policy is important, because it becomes the first respondent and commentator on the policy expected [[strategic goal (military)|strategic goal]], compared to the realities of [[Intelligence (information gathering)|identified threats]]. When the intelligence reporting is compared to the policy, it becomes possible for the national leadership to consider allocating resources over and above the officers and their subordinates military pay, and the expense of maintaining military facilities and military support services for them.\n\n===Economics===\n{{Main|Military budget}}\n\n[[File:Military Expenditures as percent of GDP 2017.png|thumb|upright=1.5|Map of military expenditures as a percentage of [[gross domestic product|GDP]] by country, 2017.<ref>'''2017''' data from: {{cite web  |url=http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/MS.MIL.XPND.GD.ZS|title=Military expenditure (% of GDP).

Military procurement is then authorised to purchase or contract provision of goods and services to the military, whether in peacetime at a permanent base, or in a combat zone from local population.\n\n===Capability development===\n{{update|section|reason=a more recent military ranking should be added|date=January 2020}}\nCapability development, which is often referred to as the military 'strength', is arguably one of the most complex activities known to humanity; because it requires determining: strategic, operational, and tactical capability requirements to counter the identified threats; strategic, [[Operational doctrine|operational]], and tactical doctrines by which the acquired capabilities will be used; identifying concepts, methods, and systems involved in executing the doctrines; creating design specifications for the manufacturers who would produce these in adequate quantity and quality for their use in combat; purchase the concepts, methods, and systems; create a forces structure that would use the concepts, methods, and systems most effectively and efficiently; integrate these concepts, methods, and systems into the force structure by providing [[military education]], [[military training|training]], and [[Military exercise|practice]] that preferably resembles combat environment of intended use; create [[military logistics]] systems to allow continued and uninterrupted performance of [[military organisation]]s under combat conditions, including provision of health services to the personnel, and maintenance for the equipment; the services to assist recovery of wounded personnel, and repair of damaged equipment; and finally, post-conflict [[demobilisation]], and disposal of war stocks surplus to peacetime requirements.\n\nDevelopment of [[military doctrine]] is perhaps the more important of all capability development activities, because it determines how military forces were, and are used in conflicts, the concepts and methods used by the command to employ appropriately military skilled, [[soldier|armed]] and [[military equipment|equipped]] personnel in achievement of the tangible goals and objectives of the [[war]], [[military campaign|campaign]], [[battle]], engagement, action or a [[duel]].<ref name=\"p.67, Dupuy\">Dupuy, T.N.

Military scientists are therefore found to interact with all Arms and Services of the armed forces, and at all levels of the military hierarchy of command.\n\nAlthough concerned with research into [[military psychology]], particularly [[Combat stress reaction|combat stress]] and how it affect troop [[morale]], often the bulk of military science activities is directed at military intelligence technology, [[military communications]], and improving [[military capability]] through research. The design, development, and prototyping of [[weapon]]s, military support equipment, and [[military technology]] in general, is also an area in which lots of effort is invested \u2013 it includes everything from global communication networks and [[aircraft carrier]]s to paint and food.\n\n===Logistics===\n{{Main|Military logistics}}\n{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2017}}\n[[File:C-1Transport aircraft02.jpg|thumb|The [[Kawasaki C-1]] is a tactical military transport of the [[Japan Air Self-Defense Force]]]]\n[[File:Convoy Red Ball Express.jpg|thumb|[[Red Ball Express]] convoy in [[France]]]]\nPossessing military capability is not sufficient if this capability cannot be deployed for, and employed in combat operations. To achieve this, [[military logistics]] are used for the [[logistics management]] and logistics planning of the forces [[military supply chain management]], the consumables, and capital equipment of the troops.\n\nAlthough mostly concerned with the [[military transport]], as a means of delivery using different modes of transport; from [[military truck]]s, to [[container ship]]s operating from permanent [[military base]], it also involves creating field supply dumps at the rear of the [[combat]] zone, and even forward supply points in specific unit's [[Tactical Area of Responsibility]].\n\nThese supply points are also used to provide [[military engineering]] services, such as the recovery of defective and derelict vehicles and weapons, maintenance of weapons in the field, the repair and field modification of weapons and equipment; and in peacetime, the life-extension programmes undertaken to allow continued use of equipment. One of the most important role of logistics is the supply of [[munition]]s as a primary type of consumable, their storage, and [[Ordnance disposal|disposal]].\n\n==In combat==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2017}}\nThe primary reason for the existence of the military is to engage in [[combat]], should it be required to do so by the national defence policy, and to win. This represents an organisational goal of any military, and the primary focus for military thought through [[military history]]. How [[victory]] is achieved, and what shape it assumes, is studied by most, if not all, military groups on three levels.\n\n===Strategic victory===\n{{Main|Strategic victory}}\n[[File:Mahratta pirates attacking the sloop 'Aurora', of the Bombay Marine, 1812; end of the action RMG BHC1085.tiff|thumb|The [[Maratha Navy]], which is considered to be the foundation of the modern [[Indian Navy]], often employed land and sea coordination tactics when attacking, which won them many battles against the [[Mughal Empire|Mughals]] and [[Portuguese Empire|Portuguese]]]]\n{{more citations needed section|date=March 2017}}\n\n[[Military strategy]] is the management of forces in [[war]]s and [[military campaign]]s by a [[commander-in-chief]], employing large military forces, either national and allied as a whole, or the component elements of [[Army|armies]], [[Navy|navies]] and [[air force]]s; such as [[army group]]s, [[naval fleet]]s, and large numbers of [[aircraft]]. Military strategy is a long-term projection of belligerents' policy, with a broad view of outcome implications, including outside the concerns of military command. Military strategy is more concerned with the [[logistics|supply of war]] and planning, than management of field forces and combat between them. The scope of strategic military planning can span weeks, but is more often months or even years.<ref name=\"p.67, Dupuy\"/>\n\n[[File:Crowd of Dutch civilians celebrating the liberation of Utrecht by the Canadian Army.jpg|thumb|Dutch civilians celebrating the arrival of the [[I Canadian Corps]] in [[Utrecht]] as the [[Canadian Army]] liberates the Netherlands from Nazi occupation]]\n\n===Operational victory===\n{{more citations needed section|date=March 2017}}\n\n[[Operational mobility]] is, within [[war]]fare and [[military doctrine]], the level of command which coordinates the minute details of [[military tactics|tactics]] with the overarching goals of [[strategy]]. A common synonym is operational art.\n\nThe operational level is at a scale bigger than one where line of sight and the time of day are important, and smaller than the strategic level, where production and politics are considerations. Formations are of the operational level if they are able to conduct operations on their own, and are of sufficient size to be directly handled or have a significant impact at the strategic level. This concept was pioneered by the [[Germany|German]] army prior to and during the [[World War II|Second World War]]. At this level, planning and duration of activities takes from one week to a month, and are executed by [[Field Army|Field Armies]] and [[Army Corps]] and their naval and air equivalents.<ref name=\"p.67, Dupuy\"/>\n\n===Tactical victory===\n{{Main|Tactical victory}}\n{{more citations needed section|date=March 2017}}\n\n[[Military tactics]] concerns itself with the methods for engaging and defeating the enemy in direct combat. Military tactics are usually used by units over hours or days, and are focused on the specific, close proximity tasks and objectives of [[squadron (army)|squadrons]], [[Company (military unit)|companies]], [[battalion]]s, [[regiment]]s, [[brigade]]s, and [[Division (military)|divisions]], and their naval and air force equivalents.<ref name=\"p.67, Dupuy\"/>\n\nOne of the oldest military publications is ''[[The Art of War]]'', by the [[List of Chinese philosophers|Chinese philosopher]] [[Sun Tzu]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mypivots.com/articles/booktext.aspx?bookname=The%20Art%20of%20War|title=The Art of War|website=Mypivots.com|publisher= |date=11 June 2011|accessdate=1 August 2011}}</ref> Written in the 6th century BCE, the 13-chapter book is intended as military instruction, and not as [[military theory]], but has had a huge influence on Asian military doctrine, and from the late 19th century, on European and United States [[military plan]]ning. It has even been used to formulate business tactics, and can even be applied in social and political areas.{{Where|date=July 2011}}\n\n[[File:Macedonian battle formation-en.svg|thumb|Battle formation and tactics of [[Macedon]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.westpoint.edu/history/SitePages/Home.aspx |title=Welcome to the Department of History|website=westpoint.edu|publisher= |accessdate=1 August 2011}}</ref>]]\n\nThe Classical Greeks and the Romans wrote prolifically on [[military campaign]]ing. Among the best-known Roman works are [[Julius Caesar]]'s commentaries on the [[Gallic Wars]], and the [[Caesar's civil war|Roman Civil war]] \u2013 written about 50 BC.\n\nTwo major works on tactics come from the late Roman period: ''Taktike Theoria'' by [[Aelianus Tacticus]], and ''[[De Re Militari]]'' ('On military matters') by [[Publius Flavius Vegetius Renatus|Vegetius]]. ''Taktike Theoria'' examined Greek military tactics, and was most influential in the [[Byzantine]] world and during the [[Islamic Golden Age|Golden Age of Islam]].\n\n''De Re Militari'' formed the basis of European military tactics until the late 17th century. Perhaps its most enduring maxim is [[Si vis pacem, para bellum|''Igitur qui desiderat pacem, praeparet bellum'']] (let he who desires peace prepare for war).\n\nDue to the changing nature of combat with the introduction of [[artillery]] in the European [[Middle Ages]], and infantry firearms in the [[Renaissance]], attempts were made to define and identify those strategies, [[grand tactics]], and tactics that would produce a victory more often than that achieved by the Romans in praying to the gods before the battle.\n\nLater this became known as [[military science]], and later still, would adopt the [[scientific method]] approach to the conduct of military operations under the influence of the [[Industrial Revolution]] thinking. In his seminal book ''[[On War]]'', the [[Prussia]]n [[Major-General]] and leading [[expert]] on modern [[military strategy]], [[Carl von Clausewitz]] defined military strategy as 'the employment of battles to gain the end of war'.<ref>{{cite book|last=MacHenry|first=Robert|title=The New Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica|journal=Chicago: Encyclopaedia Britannica Inc|origyear= |accessdate= |edition= |series= |year=1993|isbn= |oclc= |doi= |id= |page=305|chapter= |quote= |bibcode=1991neb..book.....G}}</ref> According to Clausewitz: <blockquote>\nstrategy forms the plan of the War, and to this end it links together the series of acts which are to lead to the final decision, that is to say, it makes the plans for the separate campaigns and regulates the combats to be fought in each.<ref>{{cite book|url=http://www.Gutenberg.org/files/1946/1946-h/1946-h.htm#2H_4_0023|title=''On War'' by General Carl von Clausewitz|accessdate=31 May 2007|website=Gutenberg.org|publisher= |date=2006-02-26}}</ref>\n</blockquote>\nHence, Clausewitz placed political aims above [[Strategic goal (military)|military goals]], ensuring [[civilian control of the military]]. Military strategy was one of a triumvirate of '[[Military art (Military science)|arts]]' or 'sciences' that governed the conduct of warfare, the others being: [[military tactics]], the execution of plans and [[Operational mobility|manoeuvring of forces in battle]], and maintenance of an army.\n\nThe meaning of military tactics has changed over time; from the deployment and manoeuvring of entire land armies on the fields of ancient battles, and galley fleets; to modern use of small unit [[ambush]]es, [[encirclement]]s, [[bombardment]] attacks, [[frontal assault]]s, [[air assault]]s, [[hit-and-run tactics]] used mainly by [[guerrilla]] forces, and, in some cases, [[suicide attack]]s on land and at sea. Evolution of [[aerial warfare]] introduced its own [[Air combat manoeuvring|air combat tactics]]. Often, [[military deception]], in the form of [[military camouflage]] or misdirection using [[decoy]]s, is used to confuse the enemy as a tactic.\n\nA major development in [[infantry tactics]] came with the increased use of [[trench warfare]] in the 19th and 20th centuries. This was mainly employed in [[World War I]] in the [[Battle of Gallipoli|Gallipoli campaign]], and the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]]. Trench warfare often turned to a stalemate, only broken by a large loss of life, because, in order to attack an enemy entrenchment, soldiers had to run through an exposed '[[no man's land]]' under heavy fire from their opposing entrenched enemy.\n\n==Technology==\n{{Main|Military technology}}\n{{More citations needed section|date=October 2014}}\n\n[[File:Arrow-head Olynthus BM GR1912.4-19.4.jpg|thumb|[[Arrow-head]]. Bronze, 4th century BC. From [[Olynthus]], [[Chalcidice]].]]\nAs with any occupation, since the ancient times, the military has been distinguished from other members of the society by their tools, the military weapons, and [[military equipment]] used in combat. When [[Stone Age]] humans first took a sliver of flint to tip the [[spear]], it was the first example of [[applied research|applying technology]] to improve the weapon.\n\nSince then, the advances made by human societies, and that of weapons, has been irretrievably linked. Stone weapons gave way to [[Bronze Age]] weapons, and later, the [[Iron Age]] weapons. With each technological change, was realised some tangible increase in military capability, such as through greater effectiveness of a sharper edge in defeating [[leather armour]], or [[Mechanics of materials|improved density of materials]] used in manufacture of weapons.\n\nOn [[Land warfare|land]], the first really significant technological advance in warfare was the development of the [[ranged weapon]]s, and notably, the [[Sling (weapon)|sling]]. The next significant advance came with the [[domestication of the horse]]s and mastering of [[equestrianism]].\n[[File:Caballero Armadura 4 Alcazar Segovia 2010.jpg|thumb|Mounted [[armour]]ed [[knight]]. Armour and [[cavalry]] dominated the battlefield, until the invention of [[firearms]].]]\n\nArguably, the greatest invention that affected not just the military, but all society, after adoption of fire, was the [[wheel]], and its use in the construction of the [[chariot]]. There were no advances in military technology, until, from the mechanical arm action of a slinger, the [[Ancient Greece|Greeks]], [[Egyptians]], [[Roman Empire|Romans]], [[Persia]]ns, [[History of China#Ancient China|Chinese]], etc., developed the [[siege engine]]s. The [[Bow (weapon)|bow]] was manufactured in increasingly larger and more powerful versions, to increase both the weapon range, and armour penetration performance. These developed into the powerful composite and recurve bows, and crossbows of [[History of China#Ancient China|Ancient China]]. These proved particularly useful during the rise of cavalry, as horsemen encased in ever-more sophisticated [[armour]] came to dominate the battlefield.\n\nSomewhat earlier, in medieval China, [[gunpowder]] had been invented, and was increasingly used by the military in combat. The use of gunpowder in the early [[mortar (weapon)|vase-like mortars]] in Europe, and advanced versions of the [[long bow]] and [[cross bow]], which all had armour-piercing [[arrowhead]]s, that put an end to the dominance of the armoured knight. After the long bow, which required great skill and strength to use, the next most significant technological advance was the [[musket]], which could be used effectively, with little training. In time, the successors to muskets and [[cannon]], in the form of [[rifle]]s and [[artillery]], would become core battlefield technology.\n\nAs the speed of technological advances accelerated in civilian applications, so too warfare became more [[Industrial warfare|industrialised]]. The newly invented [[machine gun]] and [[repeating rifle]] redefined [[firepower]] on the battlefield, and, in part, explains the high casualty rates of the [[American Civil War]]. The next breakthrough was the conversion of artillery parks from the [[Muzzleloader|muzzle loading guns]], to the quicker loading [[Breech-loading weapon|breech loading guns]] with recoiling barrel that allowed quicker aimed fire and use of a shield. The widespread introduction of low smoke (smokeless) propellant powders since the 1880s also allowed for a great improvement of artillery ranges.\n\nThe development of breech loading had the greatest effect on [[naval warfare]], for the first time since the Middle Ages, altering the way weapons are mounted on [[warship]]s, and therefore [[naval tactics]], now divorced from the reliance on [[Age of Sail|sails]] with the invention of the [[internal combustion]]. A further advance in military naval technology was the design of the [[submarine]], and its weapon, the [[torpedo]].\n\n[[Main battle tank]]s, and other heavy equipment such as [[armoured fighting vehicle]]s, [[military aircraft]], and [[ship]]s, are characteristic to organised military forces.\n\nDuring [[World War I]], the need to break the deadlock of trench warfare saw the rapid development of many new technologies, particularly [[tank]]s. [[Military aviation]] was extensively used, and [[bomber]]s became decisive in many battles of [[World War II]], which marked the most frantic period of weapons development in history. Many new designs, and concepts were used in combat, and all existing technologies of warfare were improved between 1939 and 1945.\n\nDuring the war, significant advances were made in [[military communications]] through increased use of radio, military intelligence through use of the [[radar]], and in [[military medicine]] through use of [[penicillin]], while in the air, the guided [[missile]], [[jet aircraft]], and [[helicopter]]s were seen for the first time. Perhaps the most infamous of all military technologies was the creation of the [[atomic bomb]], although the exact effects of its [[radiation]] were unknown until the early 1950s. Far greater use of [[military vehicles]] had finally eliminated the cavalry from the military [[force structure]].\n[[File:USAF F-15C fires AIM-7 Sparrow.jpg|thumb|[[AIM-7]] Sparrow medium range [[air-to-air missile]] from an [[F-15 Eagle]]]]\n\nAfter World War II, with the onset of the [[Cold War]], the constant technological development of new weapons was institutionalised, as participants engaged in a constant '[[arms race]]' in capability development. This constant state of weapons development continues into the present, and remains a constant drain on national resources, which some{{Who|date=March 2017}} blame on the [[military-industrial complex]].\n\nThe most significant technological developments that influenced combat have been the guided missiles, which can be used by all branches of the armed services. More recently, [[information technology]], and its use in [[surveillance]], including space-based reconnaissance systems, have played an increasing role in military operations.\n\nThe impact of [[information warfare]] that focuses on attacking command communication systems, and military databases, has been coupled with the new development in military technology, has been the use of robotic systems in intelligence combat, both in hardware and software applications.\n\nRecently, there has also been a particular focus towards the use of [[renewable fuels]] for running military vehicles on. Unlike fossil fuels, renewable fuels can be produced in any country, creating a strategic advantage. The [[US military]] has already committed itself to have 50% of its energy consumption come from alternative sources.<ref>{{cite web|author=Craig Hooper|url=http://NextNavy.com/air-force-cedes-the-green-lead-and-the-lede-to-navy/|title=Ray Mabus greening the military|website=NextNavy.com|publisher= |date= |accessdate=22 May 2012}}</ref>\n\n==As part of society==\n{{More citations needed section|date=October 2014}}\n[[File:Samurai and Ainu Fuzoku Ema.jpg|thumb|[[Samurai]], member of the Japanese warrior caste]]\nFor much of [[military history]], the armed forces were considered to be for use by the heads of their societies, until recently, the crowned heads of states. In a democracy or other political system run in the public interest, it is a [[public force]].\n\nThe relationship between the military and the [[society]] it serves is a complicated and ever-evolving one. Much depends on the nature of the society itself, and whether it sees the military as important, as for example in time of threat or war, or a burdensome expense typified by defence cuts in time of peace.\n\nOne difficult matter in the relation between military and society is control and transparency. In some countries, limited information on military operations and budgeting is accessible for the public. However transparency in the military sector is crucial to fight [[corruption]]. This showed the [[Government Defence Anti-corruption Index]] [[Transparency International|Transparency International UK]] published in 2013.<ref>{{cite web|title=Transparency is feasible|author=Pyman, Mark|url=https://www.DandC.eu/en/article/transparency-international-assesses-82-governments-defence-related-corruption-risks-first|website=www.DandC.eu|publisher=[[D+C Development and Cooperation]], Engagement GlobalGmbH|date=5 March 2013|accessdate=2 March 2017}}</ref>\n\nMilitaries often function as [[society|societies]] within societies, by having their own military communities, [[Military-industrial complex|economies]], [[Military education and training|education]], [[military medicine|medicine]], and other aspects of a functioning [[civil society|civilian society]]. Although a 'military' is not limited to nations in of itself as many [[private military companies]] (or PMC's) can be used or 'hired' by organisations and figures as security, escort, or other means of protection; where police, agencies, or militaries are absent or not trusted.\n\n===Ideology and ethics===\n{{Main|Militarism}}\n{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2017}}\n[[File:Gustavus Adolphus in action (probably at L\u00fctzen).jpg|thumb|Swedish king [[Gustavus Adolphus]] leading a cavalry charge, 1634]]\nMilitarist ideology is the [[society]]'s [[social attitude]] of being best served, or being a beneficiary of a [[government]], or guided by concepts embodied in the military ''culture, doctrine, system'', or ''leaders''.\n\nEither because of the [[cultural memory]], national history, or the potentiality of a [[military threat]], the militarist argument asserts that a [[civilian]] population is dependent upon, and thereby subservient to the needs and goals of its military for continued [[independence]]. [[Militarism]] is sometimes contrasted with the concepts of [[comprehensive national power]], [[soft power]] and [[hard power]].\n\nMost nations have separate [[military law]]s which regulate conduct in war and during peacetime. An early exponent was [[Hugo Grotius]], whose ''[[De jure belli ac pacis|On the Law of War and Peace]]'' (1625) had a major impact of the humanitarian approach to warfare development. His theme was echoed by [[Gustavus Adolphus]].\n\nEthics of warfare have developed since 1945, to create constraints on the military treatment of prisoners and civilians, primarily by the [[Geneva Conventions]]; but rarely apply to use of the military forces as internal security troops during times of political conflict that results in popular protests and incitement to [[popular uprising]].\n\nInternational protocols restrict the use, or have even created international bans on some types of weapons, notably [[weapons of mass destruction]] (WMD). [[International convention]]s define what constitutes a [[war crime]], and provides for war crimes prosecution. Individual countries also have elaborate codes of [[military justice]], an example being the United States' [[Uniform Code of Military Justice]] that can lead to [[court martial]] for military personnel found guilty of war crimes.\n\nMilitary actions are sometimes argued to be justified by furthering a humanitarian cause, such as [[disaster relief]] operations, or in defence of refugees. The term [[military humanism]] is used to refer to such actions.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|War}}\n{{-}}\n{{colbegin|colwidth=20em}}<!-- list contains terms that should actually be worked into the main article -->\n* [[Arms industry]]\n* [[Civil defense]]\n* [[Civilian control of the military]]\n* [[Command and control]]\n* [[Conscription]]\n* [[Court-martial]]\n* [[Deterrence theory]]\n* [[Martial arts]]\n* [[Martial law]]\n* [[Mercenary]]\n* [[Militaria]]\n* [[Military academy]]\n* [[Military advisor]]\n* [[Military aid]]\n* [[Military aid to the civil community]] (MACC)\n* [[Military aid to the civil power]] (MACP)\n* [[Military alliance]]\n* [[Military dictatorship]]\n* [[Military district]]\n* [[Military engineering]]\n* [[Military exercise]]\n* [[Military fiat]]\n* [[Military incompetence]]\n* [[Military junta]]\n* [[Military meteorology]]\n* [[Military operations other than war]]\n* [[Military police]]\n* [[Military prison]]\n* [[Military Revolution]]\n* [[Military sociology]]\n* [[Military terminology]]\n* [[Military\u2013industrial complex]]\n* [[Militarization of police]]\n* [[Militia]]\n* [[Ministry of Defence|Ministry/Department of Defence]]\n* [[Mobilization]]\n* [[Police]]\n* [[Private military company]]\n* [[Recruit training]]\n* [[Staff (military)]]\n* [[Standing army]]\n* [[Weapon]]\n{{colend}}\n\n; Armed forces of the world\n* [[List of countries by number of military and paramilitary personnel]]\n* [[List of countries by Military Strength Index]]\n* [[List of countries by level of military equipment]]\n* [[List of countries by Global Militarization Index]]\n* [[List of countries without armed forces]]\n* [[List of countries by military expenditures]]\n* [[List of countries by past military expenditure]]\n* [[List of countries by military expenditure per capita]]\n* [[List of air forces]]\n* [[List of armies]]\n* [[List of navies]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Sister project links|military}}\n* [http://lebanese-economy-forum.com/wdi-gdf-advanced-data-display/show/MS-MIL-XPND-GD-ZS/ Military Expenditure % of GDP] hosted by Lebanese economy forum, extracted from the World Bank public data.\n* {{curlie|Society/Military}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Military| ]]\n[[Category:Defense]]\n[[Category:Government institutions]]\n[[Category:International security]]\n[[Category:National security]]\n[[Category:Main topic articles]]\n", "name_user": "2409:4073:200a:418d:7c2b:94df:c955:1654", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military"}
