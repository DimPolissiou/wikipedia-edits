In the 19th century, the age of [[colonialism]] was at its height and the great [[Chinese diaspora]] began. Many colonies lacked a large pool of laborers.  Meanwhile, in the provinces of [[Fujian]] and [[Guangdong]] in China, there was a surge in emigration as a result of the poverty and ruin caused by the [[Taiping rebellion]].<ref>The Story of California From the Earliest Days to the Present, by Henry K.

Many Hokkien chose to work in Southeast Asia (where they had earlier links starting from the [[Ming Dynasty|Ming]] era), as did the Cantonese. The area of Taishan, in Guangdong province was the source for many of the economic migrants.{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}} San Francisco and California was an early American destination in the mid 1800s because of the California Gold Rush. Many settled in San Francisco forming one of the earliest (or earliest?;reference?) Chinatowns. For the countries in North America and Australasia, great numbers of laborers were also needed in the dangerous tasks of [[gold mining]] and [[railway]] construction.  Widespread famine in Guangdong impelled many Cantonese to work in these countries to improve the living conditions of their relatives. Some overseas Chinese were sold{{By whom|date=July 2010}} to [[South America]] during the [[Punti-Hakka Clan Wars]] (1855\u20131867) in the [[Pearl River Delta]] in Guangdong.

Moreover, the [[average height]] of [[Southern Chinese]] used to be relatively stable at around 161\u2013164&nbsp;cm for males. Another important fact is that the height of Chinese emigrants varied depending on the location they have chosen.

Many of these emigrants who entered Western countries were themselves overseas Chinese, particularly from the 1950s to the 1980s, a period during which the PRC placed severe restrictions on the movement of its citizens. In 1984, Britain agreed to transfer the sovereignty of [[Hong Kong]] to the PRC; this triggered another wave of migration to the United Kingdom (mainly England), Australia, Canada, US, South America, Europe and other parts of the world.  The [[Tiananmen Square protests of 1989]] further accelerated the migration.  The wave calmed after Hong Kong's transfer of [[sovereignty]] in 1997. In addition, many citizens of Hong Kong hold citizenships or have current visas in other countries so if the need arises, they can leave Hong Kong at short notice.  In fact, after the Tiananmen Square incident, the lines for immigration visas increased at every consulate in Hong Kong.{{Citation needed|reason=the preceding paragraph is entirely devoid of references|date=June 2018}}\n\nIn recent years, the People's Republic of China has built increasingly stronger ties with African nations.

Since the 1860s, most Chinese immigrants of the contemporary [[Chinese Filipino]]s have come from Fujian and thus form the bulk of the contemporary mixed and unmixed Chinese Filipinos and Filipinos of partial Chinese ancestry.

There are also great similarities between Vietnamese and Chinese traditions such as the use Lunar New Year, philosophy such as [[Confucianism]], [[Taoism]] and ancestor worship; leads to some [[Hoa people|Hoa]] people adopt easily to Vietnamese culture, however many Hoa still prefer to maintain Chinese cultural background. The official census from 2009 accounted the Hoa population at some 823,000 individuals and ranked 6th in terms of its population size. 70% of the Hoa live in cities and towns, mostly in Ho Chi Minh city while the rests live in the southern provinces.<ref name=\"GSO2009\" />\n\nOn the other hand, in Malaysia, Singapore, and [[Brunei]], the ethnic Chinese have maintained a distinct communal identity.\n\nIn [[East Timor]], a large fraction of Chinese are of [[Hakka people#East Timor|Hakka descent]].\n\nIn Western countries, the overseas Chinese generally use romanised versions of their Chinese names, and the use of local first names is also common.\n\n===Discrimination===\n{{See also|Sinophobia}}\n\nOverseas Chinese have often experienced hostility and [[discrimination]].\n\nIn countries with small ethnic Chinese minorities, the [[economic disparity]] can be remarkable. For example, in 1998, ethnic Chinese made up just 1% of the population of the [[Philippines]] and 4% of the population in [[Indonesia]], but have wide influence in the Philippine and Indonesian private economies.<ref>Amy Chua, \"World on Fire\", 2003, Doubleday, pp. 3, 43.</ref> The book ''[[World on Fire: How Exporting Free Market Democracy Breeds Ethnic Hatred and Global Instability|World on Fire]]'', describing the Chinese as a \"market-[[dominant minority]]\", notes that \"Chinese market dominance and intense resentment amongst the indigenous majority is characteristic of virtually every country in Southeast Asia except Thailand and Singapore\".<ref>Amy Chua, \"World on Fire\", 2003, Doubleday, p. 61.</ref> Chinese market dominance is present in Thailand and the Philippines, but is noted for its lack of resentment, while Singapore is majority ethnic Chinese. Widespread violent anti-Chinese sentiment spread across Southeast Asia, mostly occur in Malaysia and Indonesia, but not very much in Singapore, Thailand, and the Philippines.\n\nThis asymmetrical economic position has incited anti-Chinese sentiment among the poorer majorities. Sometimes the anti-Chinese attitudes turn violent, such as the [[13 May Incident]] in Malaysia in 1969 and the [[Jakarta riots of May 1998]] in Indonesia, in which more than 2,000 people died, mostly rioters burned to death in a shopping mall.<ref>[http://www.economist.com/world/asia/displayStory.cfm?story_id=4323219 Malaysia's race rules].

In Malaysia, ethnic Chinese tend to support equal and meritocratic treatment on the expectation that they would not be discriminated against in the resulting competition for government contracts, university places, etc., whereas many \"[[Bumiputra]]\" (\"native sons\") [[Malaysian Malay|Malays]] oppose this on the grounds that their group needs such protections in order to retain their patrimony. The question of to what extent ethnic Malays, Chinese, or others are \"native\" to Malaysia is a sensitive political one.

In the 19th century, the age of [[colonialism]] was at its height and the great [[Chinese diaspora]] began. Many colonies lacked a large pool of laborers.  Meanwhile, in the provinces of [[Fujian]] and [[Guangdong]] in China, there was a surge in emigration as a result of the poverty and ruin caused by the [[Taiping rebellion]].<ref>The Story of California From the Earliest Days to the Present, by Henry K.

Many Hokkien chose to work in Southeast Asia (where they had earlier links starting from the [[Ming Dynasty|Ming]] era), as did the Cantonese. The area of Taishan, in Guangdong province was the source for many of the economic migrants.{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}} San Francisco and California was an early American destination in the mid 1800s because of the California Gold Rush. Many settled in San Francisco forming one of the earliest (or earliest?;reference?) Chinatowns. For the countries in North America and Australasia, great numbers of laborers were also needed in the dangerous tasks of [[gold mining]] and [[railway]] construction.  Widespread famine in Guangdong impelled many Cantonese to work in these countries to improve the living conditions of their relatives. Some overseas Chinese were sold{{By whom|date=July 2010}} to [[South America]] during the [[Punti-Hakka Clan Wars]] (1855\u20131867) in the [[Pearl River Delta]] in Guangdong.

Moreover, the [[average height]] of [[Southern Chinese]] used to be relatively stable at around 161\u2013164&nbsp;cm for males. Another important fact is that the height of Chinese emigrants varied depending on the location they have chosen.

Many of these emigrants who entered Western countries were themselves overseas Chinese, particularly from the 1950s to the 1980s, a period during which the PRC placed severe restrictions on the movement of its citizens. In 1984, Britain agreed to transfer the sovereignty of [[Hong Kong]] to the PRC; this triggered another wave of migration to the United Kingdom (mainly England), Australia, Canada, US, South America, Europe and other parts of the world.  The [[Tiananmen Square protests of 1989]] further accelerated the migration.  The wave calmed after Hong Kong's transfer of [[sovereignty]] in 1997. In addition, many citizens of Hong Kong hold citizenships or have current visas in other countries so if the need arises, they can leave Hong Kong at short notice.  In fact, after the Tiananmen Square incident, the lines for immigration visas increased at every consulate in Hong Kong.{{Citation needed|reason=the preceding paragraph is entirely devoid of references|date=June 2018}}\n\nIn recent years, the People's Republic of China has built increasingly stronger ties with African nations.

The emergence of the [[Filipino mestizo|Mestizo class]] would later rise to the [[Principal\u00eda|noble Principalia class]], which later carried over and fueled the elite ruling classes of the [[History of the Philippines (1898\u20131946)|American era]] and later sovereign Philippines. Since the 1860s, most Chinese immigrants of the contemporary [[Chinese Filipino]]s have come from Fujian and thus form the bulk of the contemporary mixed and unmixed Chinese Filipinos and Filipinos of partial Chinese ancestry. Older generations have retained Chinese traditions and the use of [[Philippine Hokkien]] ([[Southern Min|Min Nan]]), while the current majority of younger generations largely communicate in [[Philippine English|English]], [[Filipino language|Filipino]] and other [[Languages of the Philippines|Philippine languages]] and have largely layered facets of both Western and Filipino culture onto their Chinese cultural background.\n\n[[File:East Coast Road 3, Mar 06.JPG|thumb|right|Since their early migration, many of the overseas Chinese have adopted local culture, especially in Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore and Thailand with large [[Peranakan]] community. Most of them in Singapore were once concentrated in [[Katong]].]]\n\nIn [[Myanmar]], the Chinese rarely intermarry (even amongst different Chinese linguistic groups), but have largely adopted the Burmese culture whilst maintaining Chinese cultural affinities. In [[Cambodia]], between 1965 and 1993, people with Chinese names were prevented from finding governmental employment, leading to a large number of people changing their names to a local, Cambodian name. Indonesia, and Myanmar were among the countries that do not allow birth names to be registered in foreign languages, including Chinese. But since 2003, the Indonesian government has allowed ethnic Chinese people to use their Chinese name or using their Chinese family name on their birth certificate.\n\n[[File:Sandakan Sabah PuuJihShihTemple-09.jpg|thumb|A [[Malaysian Chinese]] praying in [[Puu Jih Shih Temple]], [[Sandakan]], Sabah in front of [[Guanyin]] during [[Chinese New Year]] in 2013.]]\n\nIn Vietnam, all Chinese names can be pronounced by [[Sino-Vietnamese vocabulary|Sino-Vietnamese readings]]. For example, the name of the previous Chinese president  [[Hu Jintao|H\u00fa J\u01d0nt\u0101o]] ({{lang|zh-cn|\u80e1\u9326\u6fe4}}) would be spelled as \"H\u1ed3 C\u1ea9m \u0110\u00e0o\" in Vietnamese. There are also great similarities between Vietnamese and Chinese traditions such as the use Lunar New Year, philosophy such as [[Confucianism]], [[Taoism]] and ancestor worship; leads to some [[Hoa people|Hoa]] people adopt easily to Vietnamese culture, however many Hoa still prefer to maintain Chinese cultural background. The official census from 2009 accounted the Hoa population at some 823,000 individuals and ranked 6th in terms of its population size. 70% of the Hoa live in cities and towns, mostly in Ho Chi Minh city while the rests live in the southern provinces.<ref name=\"GSO2009\" />\n\nOn the other hand, in Malaysia, Singapore, and [[Brunei]], the ethnic Chinese have maintained a distinct communal identity.\n\nIn [[East Timor]], a large fraction of Chinese are of [[Hakka people#East Timor|Hakka descent]].\n\nIn Western countries, the overseas Chinese generally use romanised versions of their Chinese names, and the use of local first names is also common.\n\n===Discrimination===\n{{See also|Sinophobia}}\n\nOverseas Chinese have often experienced hostility and [[discrimination]].\n\nIn countries with small ethnic Chinese minorities, the [[economic disparity]] can be remarkable. For example, in 1998, ethnic Chinese made up just 1% of the population of the [[Philippines]] and 4% of the population in [[Indonesia]], but have wide influence in the Philippine and Indonesian private economies.<ref>Amy Chua, \"World on Fire\", 2003, Doubleday, pp. 3, 43.</ref> The book ''[[World on Fire: How Exporting Free Market Democracy Breeds Ethnic Hatred and Global Instability|World on Fire]]'', describing the Chinese as a \"market-[[dominant minority]]\", notes that \"Chinese market dominance and intense resentment amongst the indigenous majority is characteristic of virtually every country in Southeast Asia except Thailand and Singapore\".<ref>Amy Chua, \"World on Fire\", 2003, Doubleday, p. 61.</ref> Chinese market dominance is present in Thailand and the Philippines, but is noted for its lack of resentment, while Singapore is majority ethnic Chinese. Widespread violent anti-Chinese sentiment spread across Southeast Asia, mostly occur in Malaysia and Indonesia, but not very much in Singapore, Thailand, and the Philippines.\n\nThis asymmetrical economic position has incited anti-Chinese sentiment among the poorer majorities. Sometimes the anti-Chinese attitudes turn violent, such as the [[13 May Incident]] in Malaysia in 1969 and the [[Jakarta riots of May 1998]] in Indonesia, in which more than 2,000 people died, mostly rioters burned to death in a shopping mall.<ref>[http://www.economist.com/world/asia/displayStory.cfm?story_id=4323219 Malaysia's race rules].

The question of to what extent ethnic Malays, Chinese, or others are \"native\" to Malaysia is a sensitive political one.

Even though they're scary and weird at first glance, something inside them will change as they meet Uru and feelings of love will develop as Uru works hard to bring and show them happiness once again.\n\n== Characters ==\n\n;{{nihongo|Uru Takamura|\u9ad8\u6751\u6f64|Takamura Uru}}\n:A 16-year-old, second-year high school student with childish looks (she greatly resembles her mother) and very short height but possessing superhuman strength. Working part-time as a waitress at Cafe Bonheur, she went to live on her own after her mother got remarried in order to give the new couple some space. She was secretly lonely and unhappy with living alone, and at first considered moving back. However, after some encouraging words from Shindou, she decided to patch things up with her parents, and has since kept into contact with and sustained a good relationship with them. She is very naive and perky and always puts the happiness of others before her. She is rather oblivious and is unaware that many of her male friends have romantic feelings for her. She believes that a name is the second most important thing that a person has, next to their body, by their parents and must therefore be cherished. This phrase is later revealed to have come from her father, who is shown in her flashbacks to have been a very kind person who often wore kimonos and was the one to have named her Uru, as he wanted her to grow up to be the type of person who could instantly replenish anyone who felt down or drained. Even though she is happy for her mother, she actually wonders about and longs for her father, who died when she was young. She then finds out that she is the reason behind the death of her father.\n:She is kind of a dense girl since it took her almost the whole series to realize her feelings for Satsuki, because both Ichirou and Mitsuka messed with her. In the final chapter she confessed that the person she loves is in front of her (which was Satsuki), and waited for him for three years (while he went to France).\n;{{nihongo|Satsuki Shindou|\u9032\u85e4\u54b2\u6708|Shindou Satsuki}}\n:A 20-year-old patissier who graduated from school at the age of 15. He always has a displeased, almost yakuza look on his face. He easily loses his temper and is rather unsociable. He was raised by the caf\u00e9 manager Nankichi Matsumoto after being abandoned by his mother at a young age. He is very independent and shown to be scared of being alone, due to his mother's abandonment. However, he feels he has no choice but to accept that he will always be alone and thus chooses not to show his feelings or emotions to others as he does not want to burden them. As the story develops, he begins to open up due to Uru's support and her optimistic and comforting personality. He deeply respects Nankichi and sees him as a father figure. He does not drink or smoke, as he had taken after Nankichi's influence. He is terrified of spiders and dislikes crowds. He loves baking because he likes to see the smiles from the faces of the customers. As a child, he believed Nankichi had performed magic whenever he baked. Even though he always scorns at Uru and Ichirou, he is actually a very caring person.\n:He realized his feelings for Uru after Sou confessed to her, but still had to go to France to learn more about sweets and came back after three years.\n;{{nihongo|Ichirou Nishikawa|\u897f\u5ddd\u4e00\u90ce|Nishikawa Ichirou}}\n:An eccentric 18-year-old high school student who works as a waiter at Cafe Bonheur and the love rival of Shindou. He is often referred to as a weirdo and is always seen dozing-off when hungry. The only way to wake him up is to feed him food. He tends to have a misleading way of speaking, such as when he said \"Hello father-in-law\" to Uru's stepfather, when he meant to say \"Hello stepfather\" and calling his housekeeper cocoa-san once when he wanted him to make him cocoa for him. He is repeating his third year in high school solely because he sleeps in most of his classes. He always shows zero interest in everything around him but he actually enjoys playing along with Uru and is a good artist. His father is a doctor and his mother is a designer for children's outfits. His family has a male housekeeper who has been employed with his family since he was in kindergarten. In chapter 15, it is revealed that as a child, he would often fall asleep at the dinner table waiting up for his parents to come home to have dinner with him. Curious as to what Ichirou's reaction would be and in order to wake him up, his mother would shove food in his mouth. Because she did this for several days in a row, Ichirou's eccentric habit of falling asleep when he is hungry and waking up when he is fed developed. He initially has curly hair until he has it cut and has straight hair in chapter 23. He began working in Happy cafe around his first year in high school as Shindou realized his purpose in attracting female customers with his looks in exchange for a cake a day and grew to believe that Happy Cafe gave him something he wanted to do.\n:He loves Uru so much that he still stick with her even after three years; since, they are in the same university.\n;{{nihongo|Nankichi Matsumoto|\u677e\u672c\u5357\u5409|Matsumoto Nankichi}}\n:The manager of Cafe Bonheur and the foster father of Shindou who had been mentioned throughout the manga but did not appear until chapter 23. Unlike Shindou, he is very perky, is fond of making jokes, and cries easily as he is very emotional. A running gag throughout the series is that he has weak joints and no sense of direction. According to Shindou, he does not smoke or drink. Despite his looks, he can be a very shrewd person. He is very caring and understanding towards Shindou. He desperately wishes for Shindou to call him \"Father\" but believes Shindou doesn't (and won't change his last name) because he is still waiting for his biological family. He believes Shindou does not see him as his real family. However, Shindou later explains that he did not call him Father because the people around them looked down upon Nankichi because he had adopted Shindou at such a young age and did not want people to belittle Nankichi because of this. He hopes that Uru will marry Shindou and become his daughter-in-law.\n;{{nihongo|Sou Abekawa|\u5b89\u500d\u5ddd\u8349|Abekawa Sou}}\n:Kashiwa's younger brother. He is a first-year high school student who helps run bohneur's rival shop, 'Abeekawa Japanese Sweets' along with his brother. He is kind of shy; because of that he often behaves in a surly fashion. However, in front of customers, he fawns a business smile and acts nice and politely towards his customers. Uru tends to call him a monkey face and at first dislikes his seemingly mean disposition, but grows to consider him a friend. Originally, the Abekawa brothers didn't like Bonheur and its staff because they feel their little sister likes the shop better than their own.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Davidson |first=Zack |url=http://www.mangalife.com/reviews/REVIEWemHappyCafeemv2.htm |title=Review: Happy Cafe v2 |work=Manga Life |accessdate=April 18, 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110418201707/http://www.mangalife.com/reviews/REVIEWemHappyCafeemv2.htm |archivedate=April 18, 2011 |url-status=dead }}<!-- Dead link repair 2015-01-21. --></ref> However, they eventually come to realize that the Bohneur staff (Uru in particular) aren't as bad as they seem. He has a particular hatred for Ichirou because when Sou was three (and Ichirou was six), Sou fell in love with Ichirou at first sight, not realizing he was a guy (he didn't notice Ichirou was wearing pants) and asked him to be his girlfriend, only for Ichirou to bluntly reject him by saying he was a guy. Sou often complains that his first love experience was traumatic and wasted. Sou also develops a crush on Uru.\n;{{nihongo|Kashiwa Abekawa|\u5b89\u500d\u5ddd\u67cf|Abekawa Kashiwa}}\n:Sou's older brother, whom he deeply respects (aside from his flirtatious ways). He's a third-year high school student and has a huge sister complex on his sister Sakura. This caused him to hate Happy Cafe as he believed they stole his sister from them because she loved to go eat cakes at Happy Cafe, along with most of their female customers and waged a competition against them. However, he eventually develops a truce with them and grows to respect the Happy Cafe employees. He is also aware of Sou's crush on Uru and has attempted to advance their relationship. Kashiwa tends to be a little more laid back than his brother. He is a big flirt.\n;{{nihongo|Sakura Abekawa|\u5b89\u500d\u5ddd\u3055\u304f\u3089|Abekawa Sakura}}\n:She is the youngest of the Abekawa siblings. Sakura is very cheerful and sweet and loves strawberry deserts. She often plays with Uru in the caf\u00e9 and is also close friend with Ichirou's younger brother Jirou. It is revealed that she is actually Sou's and Kashiwa's half-sister, since their real mother died when Sou was one and Kashiwa was three. Their father remarried shortly afterwards. However, despite knowing this, her older brothers still love her and their stepmother as if they were a genuine family and vice versa. A running gag in the story is that whenever Sakura and Uru see each other, they perform unusual gymnastic poses together.\n;{{nihongo|Jirou Nishikawa|\u897f\u5ddd\u4e8c\u90ce|Nishikawa Jirou}}\n:The younger brother of Ichirou. He is classmates with Sakura and is good friends with her. His mother loves dressing him up as a girl. He is also very attached to his big brother, but he doesn't like Uru as much. However, later into the manga, where he \"approves\" of Uru as a potential bride for Ichirou. He has a weak body and is thus susceptible to illness and fatigue, and is not allowed to play with the other kids because of his weak body, with the exception of Sakura.\n;{{nihongo|'Mitsuka Yamasaki|\u5c71\u5d0e\u30de\u30a4\u30eb|Yamasaki Mitsuka}}\n:A 15 year old upcoming model and middle schooler (despite her tall height and mature beauty) who debuted in chapter 4. She is incredibly beautiful and described as cutie honey by Uru when she first met her; however, after her father told her not to waste time being a model and to marry the son of a patron company's president in order to further his own success, she decided to run away from home. She later ran into Uru after Uru saved her from some guys hitting on her. Shortly afterwards, she arrived at Cafe Happy where she worked temporarily attracting male customers. However, after Uru learns of her running away from home, she helps Mitsuka confront her father regarding his desire to have her married to someone she doesn't want, and he agrees to let her model and not marry someone she does not want to, on the condition that she return home and keep up her good grades. Since then, she has become a regular customer at happy cafe, and has become great friends with Uru, often visiting her in the shop and texting her messages that tease her about her growing romance with Shindou (she appears to understand they are developing feelings for each other). She also has an unusually large sweet tooth for a model, eating four slices of cake as \"starters\". Mitsuka resembles her mother but has the same personality as her father. It is shown in chapter 18 that her bodyguard/chauffeur Suzuki(who is nine years older and was adopted by her family after he ran away from her father's abuse) has feelings for her, which she seems to reciprocate.\n;{{nihongo|Kenshi Tokieda|\u3082\u3061\u308d\u3093 \u5065\u5fd7|Tokieda Kenshi}}\n:Uru's sixth grade cousin from her father's side (he is the son of the sister of Uru's biological father) who resembles her and has had a crush on her since he was young. The two would often spend time together as little children as their mothers went on errands together, and Uru's kindness and gentleness caused him to fall in love with her. He dislikes Uru's closeness to the Happy cafe's employees, as he believes he should be closer to her since he has known her longer. When he tells Shindou that he knows he will laugh at him because of his crush on Uru despite his age, Shindou reprimands him by saying nothing is funny about liking someone, and appears to hold a grudging respect towards him. Despite clearly conveying his feelings to Uru by handing her cookies after saying he wanted to give something to the person he liked, Uru believes this means that he has accepted her as his sister. His classmate, a half Japanese-American girl named Chiyogami Tsukishiro with a fear of men from repeated bullying from the past, has a crush on him because he defended her from some bullies who made fun of her for her American heritage, but he remains oblivious to her feelings, in a similar fashion to how Uru is oblivious to his feelings for her.\n\n==Media==\n\n===Manga===\n{{Expand list|date=April 2011}}\n{{Graphic novel list/header\n | Language       = Japanese\n | SecondLanguage = North American\n | Width          = 80%\n}}\n{{Graphic novel list\n | VolumeNumber    = 1\n | OriginalRelDate = July 19, 2005<ref name=ja01>{{Cite web |last= |first= |url=http://www.s-book.net/plsql/slib_detail?isbn=4592183118 |title=\u5e78\u798f\u55ab\u83363\u4e01\u76ee 1 |publisher=[[Hakusensha]] |date= |accessdate=April 15, 2011 }}</ref>\n | OriginalISBN    = 978-4-5921-8311-2\n | LicensedRelDate = January 1, 2010\n | LicensedISBN    = 978-1-4278-1730-3\n | ChapterListCol1 =\n | ChapterListCol2 =\n | Summary         =\nUru takes her mother's remarriage as an opportunity to work part-time at the Happy Cafe.

Even though they're scary and weird at first glance, something inside them will change as they meet Uru and feelings of love will develop as Uru works hard to bring and show them happiness once again.\n\n== Characters ==\n\n;{{nihongo|Uru Takamura|\u9ad8\u6751\u6f64|Takamura Uru}}\n:A 16-year-old, second-year high school student with childish looks (she greatly resembles her mother) and very short height but possessing superhuman strength. Working part-time as a waitress at Cafe Bonheur, she went to live on her own after her mother got remarried in order to give the new couple some space. She was secretly lonely and unhappy with living alone, and at first considered moving back. However, after some encouraging words from Shindou, she decided to patch things up with her parents, and has since kept into contact with and sustained a good relationship with them. She is very naive and perky and always puts the happiness of others before her. She is rather oblivious and is unaware that many of her male friends have romantic feelings for her. She believes that a name is the second most important thing that a person has, next to their body, by their parents and must therefore be cherished. This phrase is later revealed to have come from her father, who is shown in her flashbacks to have been a very kind person who often wore kimonos and was the one to have named her Uru, as he wanted her to grow up to be the type of person who could instantly replenish anyone who felt down or drained. Even though she is happy for her mother, she actually wonders about and longs for her father, who died when she was young. She then finds out that she is the reason behind the death of her father.\n:She is kind of a dense girl since it took her almost the whole series to realize her feelings for Satsuki, because both Ichirou and Mitsuka messed with her. In the final chapter she confessed that the person she loves is in front of her (which was Satsuki), and waited for him for three years (while he went to France).\n;{{nihongo|Satsuki Shindou|\u9032\u85e4\u54b2\u6708|Shindou Satsuki}}\n:A 20-year-old patissier who graduated from school at the age of 15. He always has a displeased, almost yakuza look on his face. He easily loses his temper and is rather unsociable. He was raised by the caf\u00e9 manager Nankichi Matsumoto after being abandoned by his mother at a young age. He is very independent and shown to be scared of being alone, due to his mother's abandonment. However, he feels he has no choice but to accept that he will always be alone and thus chooses not to show his feelings or emotions to others as he does not want to burden them. As the story develops, he begins to open up due to Uru's support and her optimistic and comforting personality. He deeply respects Nankichi and sees him as a father figure. He does not drink or smoke, as he had taken after Nankichi's influence. He is terrified of spiders and dislikes crowds. He loves baking because he likes to see the smiles from the faces of the customers. As a child, he believed Nankichi had performed magic whenever he baked. Even though he always scorns at Uru and Ichirou, he is actually a very caring person.\n:He realized his feelings for Uru after Sou confessed to her, but still had to go to France to learn more about sweets and came back after three years.\n;{{nihongo|Ichirou Nishikawa|\u897f\u5ddd\u4e00\u90ce|Nishikawa Ichirou}}\n:An eccentric 18-year-old high school student who works as a waiter at Cafe Bonheur and the love rival of Shindou. He is often referred to as a weirdo and is always seen dozing-off when hungry. The only way to wake him up is to feed him food. He tends to have a misleading way of speaking, such as when he said \"Hello father-in-law\" to Uru's stepfather, when he meant to say \"Hello stepfather\" and calling his housekeeper cocoa-san once when he wanted him to make him cocoa for him. He is repeating his third year in high school solely because he sleeps in most of his classes. He always shows zero interest in everything around him but he actually enjoys playing along with Uru and is a good artist. His father is a doctor and his mother is a designer for children's outfits. His family has a male housekeeper who has been employed with his family since he was in kindergarten. In chapter 15, it is revealed that as a child, he would often fall asleep at the dinner table waiting up for his parents to come home to have dinner with him. Curious as to what Ichirou's reaction would be and in order to wake him up, his mother would shove food in his mouth. Because she did this for several days in a row, Ichirou's eccentric habit of falling asleep when he is hungry and waking up when he is fed developed. He initially has curly hair until he has it cut and has straight hair in chapter 23. He began working in Happy cafe around his first year in high school as Shindou realized his purpose in attracting female customers with his looks in exchange for a cake a day and grew to believe that Happy Cafe gave him something he wanted to do.\n:He loves Uru so much that he still stick with her even after three years; since, they are in the same university.\n;{{nihongo|Nankichi Matsumoto|\u677e\u672c\u5357\u5409|Matsumoto Nankichi}}\n:The manager of Cafe Bonheur and the foster father of Shindou who had been mentioned throughout the manga but did not appear until chapter 23. Unlike Shindou, he is very perky, is fond of making jokes, and cries easily as he is very emotional. A running gag throughout the series is that he has weak joints and no sense of direction. According to Shindou, he does not smoke or drink. Despite his looks, he can be a very shrewd person. He is very caring and understanding towards Shindou. He desperately wishes for Shindou to call him \"Father\" but believes Shindou doesn't (and won't change his last name) because he is still waiting for his biological family. He believes Shindou does not see him as his real family. However, Shindou later explains that he did not call him Father because the people around them looked down upon Nankichi because he had adopted Shindou at such a young age and did not want people to belittle Nankichi because of this. He hopes that Uru will marry Shindou and become his daughter-in-law.\n;{{nihongo|Sou Abekawa|\u5b89\u500d\u5ddd\u8349|Abekawa Sou}}\n:Kashiwa's younger brother. He is a first-year high school student who helps run bohneur's rival shop, 'Abeekawa Japanese Sweets' along with his brother. He is kind of shy; because of that he often behaves in a surly fashion. However, in front of customers, he fawns a business smile and acts nice and politely towards his customers. Uru tends to call him a monkey face and at first dislikes his seemingly mean disposition, but grows to consider him a friend. Originally, the Abekawa brothers didn't like Bonheur and its staff because they feel their little sister likes the shop better than their own.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Davidson |first=Zack |url=http://www.mangalife.com/reviews/REVIEWemHappyCafeemv2.htm |title=Review: Happy Cafe v2 |work=Manga Life |accessdate=April 18, 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110418201707/http://www.mangalife.com/reviews/REVIEWemHappyCafeemv2.htm |archivedate=April 18, 2011 |url-status=dead }}<!-- Dead link repair 2015-01-21. --></ref> However, they eventually come to realize that the Bohneur staff (Uru in particular) aren't as bad as they seem. He has a particular hatred for Ichirou because when Sou was three (and Ichirou was six), Sou fell in love with Ichirou at first sight, not realizing he was a guy (he didn't notice Ichirou was wearing pants) and asked him to be his girlfriend, only for Ichirou to bluntly reject him by saying he was a guy. Sou often complains that his first love experience was traumatic and wasted. Sou also develops a crush on Uru.\n;{{nihongo|Kashiwa Abekawa|\u5b89\u500d\u5ddd\u67cf|Abekawa Kashiwa}}\n:Sou's older brother, whom he deeply respects (aside from his flirtatious ways). He's a third-year high school student and has a huge sister complex on his sister Sakura. This caused him to hate Happy Cafe as he believed they stole his sister from them because she loved to go eat cakes at Happy Cafe, along with most of their female customers and waged a competition against them. However, he eventually develops a truce with them and grows to respect the Happy Cafe employees. He is also aware of Sou's crush on Uru and has attempted to advance their relationship. Kashiwa tends to be a little more laid back than his brother. He is a big flirt.\n;{{nihongo|Sakura Abekawa|\u5b89\u500d\u5ddd\u3055\u304f\u3089|Abekawa Sakura}}\n:She is the youngest of the Abekawa siblings. Sakura is very cheerful and sweet and loves strawberry deserts. She often plays with Uru in the caf\u00e9 and is also close friend with Ichirou's younger brother Jirou. It is revealed that she is actually Sou's and Kashiwa's half-sister, since their real mother died when Sou was one and Kashiwa was three. Their father remarried shortly afterwards. However, despite knowing this, her older brothers still love her and their stepmother as if they were a genuine family and vice versa. A running gag in the story is that whenever Sakura and Uru see each other, they perform unusual gymnastic poses together.\n;{{nihongo|Jirou Nishikawa|\u897f\u5ddd\u4e8c\u90ce|Nishikawa Jirou}}\n:The younger brother of Ichirou. He is classmates with Sakura and is good friends with her. His mother loves dressing him up as a girl. He is also very attached to his big brother, but he doesn't like Uru as much. However, later into the manga, where he \"approves\" of Uru as a potential bride for Ichirou. He has a weak body and is thus susceptible to illness and fatigue, and is not allowed to play with the other kids because of his weak body, with the exception of Sakura.\n;{{nihongo|'Mitsuka Yamasaki|\u5c71\u5d0e\u30de\u30a4\u30eb|Yamasaki Mitsuka}}\n:A 15 year old upcoming model and middle schooler (despite her tall height and mature beauty) who debuted in chapter 4. She is incredibly beautiful and described as cutie honey by Uru when she first met her; however, after her father told her not to waste time being a model and to marry the son of a patron company's president in order to further his own success, she decided to run away from home. She later ran into Uru after Uru saved her from some guys hitting on her. Shortly afterwards, she arrived at Cafe Happy where she worked temporarily attracting male customers. However, after Uru learns of her running away from home, she helps Mitsuka confront her father regarding his desire to have her married to someone she doesn't want, and he agrees to let her model and not marry someone she does not want to, on the condition that she return home and keep up her good grades. Since then, she has become a regular customer at happy cafe, and has become great friends with Uru, often visiting her in the shop and texting her messages that tease her about her growing romance with Shindou (she appears to understand they are developing feelings for each other). She also has an unusually large sweet tooth for a model, eating four slices of cake as \"starters\". Mitsuka resembles her mother but has the same personality as her father. It is shown in chapter 18 that her bodyguard/chauffeur Suzuki(who is nine years older and was adopted by her family after he ran away from her father's abuse) has feelings for her, which she seems to reciprocate.\n;{{nihongo|Kenshi Tokieda|\u3082\u3061\u308d\u3093 \u5065\u5fd7|Tokieda Kenshi}}\n:Uru's sixth grade cousin from her father's side (he is the son of the sister of Uru's biological father) who resembles her and has had a crush on her since he was young. The two would often spend time together as little children as their mothers went on errands together, and Uru's kindness and gentleness caused him to fall in love with her. He dislikes Uru's closeness to the Happy cafe's employees, as he believes he should be closer to her since he has known her longer. When he tells Shindou that he knows he will laugh at him because of his crush on Uru despite his age, Shindou reprimands him by saying nothing is funny about liking someone, and appears to hold a grudging respect towards him. Despite clearly conveying his feelings to Uru by handing her cookies after saying he wanted to give something to the person he liked, Uru believes this means that he has accepted her as his sister. His classmate, a half Japanese-American girl named Chiyogami Tsukishiro with a fear of men from repeated bullying from the past, has a crush on him because he defended her from some bullies who made fun of her for her American heritage, but he remains oblivious to her feelings, in a similar fashion to how Uru is oblivious to his feelings for her.\n\n==Media==\n\n===Manga===\n{{Expand list|date=April 2011}}\n{{Graphic novel list/header\n | Language       = Japanese\n | SecondLanguage = North American\n | Width          = 80%\n}}\n{{Graphic novel list\n | VolumeNumber    = 1\n | OriginalRelDate = July 19, 2005<ref name=ja01>{{Cite web |last= |first= |url=http://www.s-book.net/plsql/slib_detail?isbn=4592183118 |title=\u5e78\u798f\u55ab\u83363\u4e01\u76ee 1 |publisher=[[Hakusensha]] |date= |accessdate=April 15, 2011 }}</ref>\n | OriginalISBN    = 978-4-5921-8311-2\n | LicensedRelDate = January 1, 2010\n | LicensedISBN    = 978-1-4278-1730-3\n | ChapterListCol1 =\n | ChapterListCol2 =\n | Summary         =\nUru takes her mother's remarriage as an opportunity to work part-time at the Happy Cafe.

Twelve of these populations occurred in [[Lampung Province]], where only three populations were extant in 2002 according to surveys carried out between September 2000 and March 2002. The population in [[Bukit Barisan Selatan National Park]] was estimated at 498 individuals, while the population in [[Way Kambas National Park]] was estimated at 180 individuals. The third population in Gunung Rindingan\u2013Way Waya complex was considered to be too small to be viable over the long-term.<ref name=Hedges05>Hedges, S., Tyson, M. J., Sitompul, A.
