Containment is undertaken in the early stages of the outbreak and aims to trace and isolate those infected as well as introduce other measures of infection control and vaccinations to stop the disease from spreading to the rest of the population. When it is no longer possible to contain the spread of the disease, efforts then move to the mitigation stage: measures are taken to slow the spread and mitigate its effects on the healthcare system and society. A combination of both containment and mitigation measures may be undertaken at the same time.<ref name=\"NY0JD\" /> Suppression requires more extreme measures so as to reverse the pandemic by reducing the [[basic reproduction number]] to less than 1.<ref name=\"ImpCollege16mar2020\" />\n\nPart of managing an infectious disease outbreak is trying to decrease the epidemic peak, known as flattening the epidemic curve.<ref name=\"Lancet2020Flatten\" /> This decreases the risk of health services being overwhelmed and provides more time for vaccines and treatments to be developed.<ref name=\"Lancet2020Flatten\" /> Non-pharmaceutical interventions that may manage the outbreak include personal preventive measures, such as hand hygiene, wearing face-masks, and self-quarantine; community measures aimed at physical distancing such as closing schools and cancelling mass gathering events; community engagement to encourage acceptance and participation in such interventions; as well as environmental measures such surface cleaning.<ref name=\"community mitigation\" />\n\nMore drastic actions aimed at containing the outbreak were taken in China once the severity of the outbreak became apparent, such as quarantining entire cities and imposing strict travel bans.<ref name=\"RwmYm\" /> Other countries also adopted a variety of measures aimed at limiting the spread of the virus. South Korea introduced mass screening and localized quarantines, and issued alerts on the movements of infected individuals. Singapore provided financial support for those infected who quarantined themselves and imposed large fines for those who failed to do so. Taiwan increased face mask production and penalized hoarding of medical supplies.<ref name=\"shZdf\" />\n\nSimulations for Great Britain and the United States show that mitigation (slowing but not stopping epidemic spread) and suppression (reversing epidemic growth) have major challenges.<!--ref name=ImpCollege16mar2020--> Optimal mitigation policies might reduce peak healthcare demand by 2/3 and deaths by half, but still result in hundreds of thousands of deaths and health systems being overwhelmed.<!--ref name=ImpCollege16mar2020--> Suppression can be preferred but needs to be maintained for as long as the virus is circulating in the human population (or until a vaccine becomes available, if that comes first), as transmission otherwise quickly rebounds when measures are relaxed.

Containment is undertaken in the early stages of the outbreak and aims to trace and isolate those infected as well as introduce other measures of infection control and vaccinations to stop the disease from spreading to the rest of the population. When it is no longer possible to contain the spread of the disease, efforts then move to the mitigation stage: measures are taken to slow the spread and mitigate its effects on the healthcare system and society. A combination of both containment and mitigation measures may be undertaken at the same time.<ref name=\"NY0JD\" /> Suppression requires more extreme measures so as to reverse the pandemic by reducing the [[basic reproduction number]] to less than 1.<ref name=\"ImpCollege16mar2020\" />\n\nPart of managing an infectious disease outbreak is trying to decrease the epidemic peak, known as flattening the epidemic curve.<ref name=\"Lancet2020Flatten\" /> This decreases the risk of health services being overwhelmed and provides more time for vaccines and treatments to be developed.<ref name=\"Lancet2020Flatten\" /> Non-pharmaceutical interventions that may manage the outbreak include personal preventive measures, such as hand hygiene, wearing face-masks, and self-quarantine; community measures aimed at physical distancing such as closing schools and cancelling mass gathering events; community engagement to encourage acceptance and participation in such interventions; as well as environmental measures such surface cleaning.<ref name=\"community mitigation\" />\n\nMore drastic actions aimed at containing the outbreak were taken in China once the severity of the outbreak became apparent, such as quarantining entire cities and imposing strict travel bans.<ref name=\"RwmYm\" /> Other countries also adopted a variety of measures aimed at limiting the spread of the virus. South Korea introduced mass screening and localized quarantines, and issued alerts on the movements of infected individuals. Singapore provided financial support for those infected who quarantined themselves and imposed large fines for those who failed to do so. Taiwan increased face mask production and penalized hoarding of medical supplies.<ref name=\"shZdf\" />\n\nSimulations for Great Britain and the United States show that mitigation (slowing but not stopping epidemic spread) and suppression (reversing epidemic growth) have major challenges.<!--ref name=ImpCollege16mar2020--> Optimal mitigation policies might reduce peak healthcare demand by 2/3 and deaths by half, but still result in hundreds of thousands of deaths and health systems being overwhelmed.<!--ref name=ImpCollege16mar2020--> Suppression can be preferred but needs to be maintained for as long as the virus is circulating in the human population (or until a vaccine becomes available, if that comes first), as transmission otherwise quickly rebounds when measures are relaxed.

It was intended to be a romantic allegorical account of Maximilian's own participation in a series of [[Tournament (medieval)|jousting tournaments]] in the guise of the tale's eponymous hero, Freydal. In the story, Freydal takes part in the tournaments to prove that he is worthy to marry a princess, who is a fictionalised representation of Maximilian's late wife, [[Mary of Burgundy]].\n\nThe text was never completed, although a manuscript draft is held by the [[Austrian National Library]]. 256 [[Miniature (illuminated manuscript)|miniature paintings]] to accompany the text were created by court painters, and 255 are preserved in an [[illuminated manuscript]] \u2018tournament book\u2019 held by the [[Kunsthistorisches Museum]] in [[Vienna]]. These miniatures vividly record the different types of jousts that were popular at the time as well as the [[Masquerade ball|court masquerades]], or \u2018mummeries\u2019, that took place at the end of the day after each tournament. It is the most extensive visual record of late medieval tournaments and court masquerades that exists.\n\n==Background==\n[[File:Albrecht D\u00fcrer - Portrait of Maximilian I - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|left|Portrait of [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor|Maximilian I]] by [[Albrecht D\u00fcrer]], 1519.]]\n[[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor|Maximilian I]] and his father [[Frederick III, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick III]] were part of what was to become a long line of [[Holy Roman Emperors]] from the [[House of Habsburg]]. Maximilian was elected [[King of the Romans]] in 1486; upon his father's death in 1493 he succeeded to the throne of the Holy Roman Empire.<ref>{{harvnb|Terjanian|2019|p=303}}</ref>\n\nDuring his reign, Maximilian commissioned a number of [[Renaissance humanism|humanist]] scholars and artists to assist him in completing a series of projects, in different art forms, intended to immortalize his life and deeds and those of his Habsburg ancestors.<ref name=\"Watanabe-O'Kelly94\">{{harvnb| Watanabe-O'Kelly|2000|p=94}}</ref> He referred to these projects as ''Gedechtnus'' (\"memorial\"),<ref name=\"Kleinschmidt162\">{{harvnb|Kleinschmidt|2008|p=162}}</ref> and included a series of stylised autobiographical works: ''Freydal'', the prose romance ''[[Weisskunig]]'', and the poem ''[[Theuerdank]]''.<ref name=\"Watanabe-O'Kelly94\"/>\n\n''Freydal'' and ''Theuerdank'' are closely linked and together give an allegorical account of the events leading to Maximilian's marriage to [[Mary of Burgundy]] in 1477.<ref name=moma120>{{harvnb| Terjanian |2019|p=120}}</ref> Mary died five years later, in 1482.<ref>{{harvnb|Terjanian|2019|p=300}}</ref> In ''Freydal'', which is partly a tribute to Mary,<ref name=\"Clephan 1995 88\">{{harvnb|Clephan|1995|p=88}}</ref> the eponymous hero pursues his fair lady by [[jousting]] in [[Tournament (medieval)|tournaments]].<ref name=Freeman>{{harvnb|Freeman|2019}}</ref> ''Theuerdank'' is effectively a sequel in which the hero overcomes dangers on the journey to his wedding.<ref name=moma120/> ''Freydal'' has a comedic tone which contrasts with ''Theuerdank'', which has more of the character of a tragedy.<ref name=McLaren/>\n\nThe theme of ''Freydal'' reflects Maximilian's lifelong enthusiasm for jousting. He attended his first tournament at the age of 14 and was captivated by its traditions and spectacle.<ref name=Freeman/> He staged many tournaments, including those to celebrate his wedding to Mary of Burgundy in 1477, his coronation as King of the Romans in 1486 and on the occasion of the [[First Congress of Vienna]] in 1515.<ref name=Freeman/> Maximilian was himself a participant in tournaments from 1485 until 1511, when he was in his 50s.<ref>{{harvnb|Anderson|2017|pp=104\u2013105}}</ref> His affinity for jousting contributed to his [[soubriquet]] the \u201clast knight\u201d.<ref name=Freeman/>\n[[File:Freydal fol164.jpg|upright=1.2|thumb|right|Post-tournament festivities: grotesque-style dancers or mummers dance a [[moresca]] while Freydal, in a mask and holding torches, looks on (''Freydal'' ms. fol.164, [[Kunsthistorisches Museum|KMW]])<ref name=Locke123/>]]\n\n==Creation and history==\nMaximilian appears to have begun planning in 1502.<ref name=moma123>{{harvnb| Terjanian |2019|p=123}}</ref> The name ''Freydal'' was derived from ''Freyd-alb'', meaning \"white joyful young man\"<ref>{{harvnb|Strobl|1913|p=4}}</ref> In that year, he instructed his court taylor, Martin Trummer \"to have drawn in a book all those costumes as yet seen in mummeries organised by his majesty\".<ref name=moma123/> A \u201cmummery\u201d was a late medieval courtly [[Masquerade ball|masquerade]] or costumed dance.<ref name=moma122>{{harvnb| Terjanian |2019|p=122}}</ref>\n\nThis developed into the commissioning of planning sketches for the entire work, created over the next ten years.<ref name=moma123/> They were drawn in pen on [[laid paper]], using brown and black ink with watercolour over black chalk and leadpoint.<ref name=moma123/> A collection of 203 of these are housed in the [[National Gallery of Art]] in [[Washington, D.C.]]<ref>{{harvnb| Terjanian |2019|pp=120, 123}}</ref> A small number of additional drawings are held at the [[British Museum]] and the [[Vatican Library]].<ref name=moma123/>\n\nMaximilian took a leading part in the creation of the work.<ref name=Clephan87>{{harvnb|Clephan|1995|p=87}}</ref> His instructions on the subjects to be illustrated as well as corrections, in his own hand, of some of the proofs have survived.

The narrative ends with Freydal setting out to search for her, and ''Theuerdank'' then takes up the subsequent story.<ref name=moma121/>\n\nThe work reflects Maximilian's vanity, as exemplified by a poem which forms part of the draft text:<ref name=\"Clephan 1995 88\"/>{{Quotation|This did the gallant Freydal<br>In knightly deeds of fame<br>Thus rendering illustrious<br>The glories of his name.<br>His virtues and his goodness<br>Are manifest to all;<br>His many glorious triumphs<br>At tilt, at masks and ball...<br>His like will ne\u2019er be seen again.<ref>translation {{harvnb|Clephan|1995|p=88, note 1}}</ref>}}\n\nHowever, the tournaments described are based on encounters Maximilian actually had. This is evidenced by a list of people involved in the story in the first seven [[Paper quire|quire]]s of the draft text, and who are known to have been actual courtiers.<ref name=Silver64/>\n\n===Illuminated manuscript tournament book===\n[[File:Freydal 02.jpg|upright=1.2|thumb|left|Freydal in a \u201cjoust of war with flying and exploding shields\u201d (''Geschifttartschen-Rennen'') with Sigmund von Welsperg (''Freydal'' ms. fol. 29, [[Kunsthistorisches Museum|KMW]])<ref>{{harvnb|Krause|2014|pp=175\u2013176}}</ref>]]\nThe miniatures in the tournament book manuscript illustrate the types of [[jousting]] popular at the time, both on horse and on foot.<ref name=McLaren/> Freydal features in each illustrated combat and his opponent is an historical figure with whom Maximilian actually jousted.<ref name=McLaren/> Each picture, in the lower margin, identifies the name of the opponent and the other courtiers depicted.<ref name=Locke123>{{harvnb|Locke|2015|p=123}}</ref>\n\nTwo types of joust, ''Rennen'' (or \u201cjousts of war\u201d where the lance has a sharpened tip<ref name= joust>{{harvnb|Jeep|2001|p=759}}; {{harvnb|Silver|2002|p=63}}</ref>) and ''Stechen'' (or \u201cjousts of peace\u201d where the lance has a blunted tip<ref name= joust/>) are depicted for each tournament.<ref name=Clephan87/><ref name=moma121/> Within these two broad groupings, eleven sub-types are shown.<ref name=moma121/> In the ''Welsches Gestecht'' (Italian joust of peace) a board separates the jousters so that they can ride more closely to each other and strike their opponent frontally with greater force. This results in a spectacular splintering of the lances. In the ''Scharfrennen'' (joust of war with flying shields) the shield is shown loosely fixed to the rider's breastplate, the aim being to dislodge it. In contrast, the objective of the ''Antzogenrennen'' is to unseat the opponent and his shield is fixed to his armour.<ref name=moma121/> The ''Feldrennen'' (or ''Kampfrennen'') jousts replicate skirmishes in war and the riders wear battlefield armour. The rarest type of joust depicted is the ''Kr\u00f6nlrennen'' where one rider wears the armour of a joust of peace but wields the lance of a joust of war and the other rider  has the opposite combination.<ref name=moma122/>\n\nOne of the most spectacular jousts depicted is the ''Bundrennen'' (joust of war with flying shields without [[bevors]])<ref name=moma121/> and its variation, ''Geschifttartschen-Rennen'' (joust of war with flying and exploding shields).<ref name=moma125>{{harvnb|Terjanian|2019|p=125}}</ref> In the ''Bundrennen'', the shield is held in place on the rider's breastplate with a complicated spring mechanism and when it is struck in the right place by the opponent it is ejected high into the air.<ref name=moma121/> The ''Geschifttartschen-Rennen'' increases the spectacle by attaching multiple triangular platelets to the shield which, when the shield is ejected, come loose and explode into the air like a firework display.<ref name=moma125/> Maximilian claimed to have invented this type of joust.<ref name=Freeman/> \n[[File:Freydal 05.jpg|upright=1.2|thumb|right|Foot combat between Freydal and Claude de Vaudry (''Freydal'' ms. fol. 39, [[Kunsthistorisches Museum|KMW]])<ref name=moma120/>]]\nIn each of the tournaments, the participants are shown engaging in a foot combat. A variety of weapons are used, including [[Mace (bludgeon)|iron clubs]] (''Eisenkolben''), [[Flail (weapon)|flails]] (''Drischel''), swords (''Turnierschwert'')<ref name=krause179>{{harvnb|Krause|2014|p=179}}</ref> and daggers.<ref name=krause181>{{harvnb|Krause|2014|p=181}}</ref> The ''[[Melee (tournament)|m\u00eal\u00e9e]]'' is also shown in the manuscript.<ref name=Clephan87/>\n\nAfter each of the sixty-four tournaments is a scene depicting a [[moresca]] (a pantomime dance) or other post-tournament festivities with male courtiers, including the knights who had competed in the tournament, dressing up to dance in a variety of exotic costumes.<ref name=Locke121/> Known as \u2018mummeries\u2019, these were a regular feature of the evening entertainment after tournaments.<ref name=moma122/>\n\nThe male courtiers in the mummeries in the manuscript dress up, amongst other things, in costumes based on nationality or ethnicity, for example [[Ottoman Turks|Turkish]], [[Republic of Venice|Venetian]] or [[Burgundian Netherlands|Burgundian]] costume, or as animals such as [[apes]] and creatures with bird's heads.<ref name=Locke121/> In one masquerade illustrated, the male participants engage in [[cross-dressing]] and wear women's gowns.<ref name=moma122/>\n\nIn each scene, all the men are dressed in the same costume and normally wear a mask.

Not only is it the largest surviving tournament book, it is also an unparalleled pictorial source of jousting from the late medieval period.<ref>{{harv|Terjanian|2019|pp=120-121}}</ref> It is the only one to depict spectacular falls.<ref name=Freeman/> In addition to illustrating the jousts themselves, it represents a remarkable catalogue of the weaponry used during tournaments<ref name=Freeman/> and is the most extensive record of mummery, the early court masquerade, that exists.<ref name=moma122/> The manuscript has been recognised in [[UNESCO]]\u2019s [[Memory of the World]] programme.<ref>{{harv|Taschen Catalogue}}</ref>\n\nHowever, ''Freydal'' was intended to be not only an artistic work but also political propaganda.<ref>{{harv|Barber|1974|p=298}}</ref> As part of what he called his \u2018memorial projects\u2019 or ''Gedechtnus'', Maximilian I used literary and visual works such as ''Freydal'' to model and enhance his public image. His aim was to make up for his actual powerlessness and lack of centralised control over his own realms.<ref name=muller>{{harv| M\u00fcller|2003|pp=307-308}}</ref> As the historian [[Jan-Dirk M\u00fcller]] ([[:de:Jan-Dirk M\u00fcller |de]]) has said, the extent to which Maximilian employed this strategy meant that his court \u201cliterally existed on paper: to a large extent it was a

It was intended to be a romantic allegorical account of Maximilian's own participation in a series of [[Tournament (medieval)|jousting tournaments]] in the guise of the tale's eponymous hero, Freydal. In the story, Freydal takes part in the tournaments to prove that he is worthy to marry a princess, who is a fictionalised representation of Maximilian's late wife, [[Mary of Burgundy]].\n\nThe text was never completed, although a manuscript draft is held by the [[Austrian National Library]]. 256 [[Miniature (illuminated manuscript)|miniature paintings]] to accompany the text were created by court painters, and 255 are preserved in an [[illuminated manuscript]] \u2018tournament book\u2019 held by the [[Kunsthistorisches Museum]] in [[Vienna]]. These miniatures vividly record the different types of jousts that were popular at the time as well as the [[Masquerade ball|court masquerades]], or \u2018mummeries\u2019, that took place at the end of the day after each tournament. It is the most extensive visual record of late medieval tournaments and court masquerades that exists.\n\n==Background==\n[[File:Albrecht D\u00fcrer - Portrait of Maximilian I - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|left|Portrait of [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor|Maximilian I]] by [[Albrecht D\u00fcrer]], 1519.]]\n[[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor|Maximilian I]] and his father [[Frederick III, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick III]] were part of what was to become a long line of [[Holy Roman Emperors]] from the [[House of Habsburg]]. Maximilian was elected [[King of the Romans]] in 1486; upon his father's death in 1493 he succeeded to the throne of the Holy Roman Empire.<ref>{{harvnb|Terjanian|2019|p=303}}</ref>\n\nDuring his reign, Maximilian commissioned a number of [[Renaissance humanism|humanist]] scholars and artists to assist him in completing a series of projects, in different art forms, intended to immortalize his life and deeds and those of his Habsburg ancestors.<ref name=\"Watanabe-O'Kelly94\">{{harvnb| Watanabe-O'Kelly|2000|p=94}}</ref> He referred to these projects as ''Gedechtnus'' (\"memorial\"),<ref name=\"Kleinschmidt162\">{{harvnb|Kleinschmidt|2008|p=162}}</ref> and included a series of stylised autobiographical works: ''Freydal'', the prose romance ''[[Weisskunig]]'', and the poem ''[[Theuerdank]]''.<ref name=\"Watanabe-O'Kelly94\"/>\n\n''Freydal'' and ''Theuerdank'' are closely linked and together give an allegorical account of the events leading to Maximilian's marriage to [[Mary of Burgundy]] in 1477.<ref name=moma120>{{harvnb| Terjanian |2019|p=120}}</ref> Mary died five years later, in 1482.<ref>{{harvnb|Terjanian|2019|p=300}}</ref> In ''Freydal'', which is partly a tribute to Mary,<ref name=\"Clephan 1995 88\">{{harvnb|Clephan|1995|p=88}}</ref> the eponymous hero pursues his fair lady by [[jousting]] in [[Tournament (medieval)|tournaments]].<ref name=Freeman>{{harvnb|Freeman|2019}}</ref> ''Theuerdank'' is effectively a sequel in which the hero overcomes dangers on the journey to his wedding.<ref name=moma120/> ''Freydal'' has a comedic tone which contrasts with ''Theuerdank'', which has more of the character of a tragedy.<ref name=McLaren/>\n\nThe theme of ''Freydal'' reflects Maximilian's lifelong enthusiasm for jousting. He attended his first tournament at the age of 14 and was captivated by its traditions and spectacle.<ref name=Freeman/> He staged many tournaments, including those to celebrate his wedding to Mary of Burgundy in 1477, his coronation as King of the Romans in 1486 and on the occasion of the [[First Congress of Vienna]] in 1515.<ref name=Freeman/> Maximilian was himself a participant in tournaments from 1485 until 1511, when he was in his 50s.<ref>{{harvnb|Anderson|2017|pp=104\u2013105}}</ref> His affinity for jousting contributed to his [[soubriquet]] the \u201clast knight\u201d.<ref name=Freeman/>\n[[File:Freydal fol164.jpg|upright=1.2|thumb|right|Post-tournament festivities: grotesque-style dancers or mummers dance a [[moresca]] while Freydal, in a mask and holding torches, looks on (''Freydal'' ms. fol.164, [[Kunsthistorisches Museum|KMW]])<ref name=Locke123/>]]\n\n==Creation and history==\nMaximilian appears to have begun planning in 1502.<ref name=moma123>{{harvnb| Terjanian |2019|p=123}}</ref> The name ''Freydal'' was derived from ''Freyd-alb'', meaning \"white joyful young man\"<ref>{{harvnb|Strobl|1913|p=4}}</ref> In that year, he instructed his court taylor, Martin Trummer \"to have drawn in a book all those costumes as yet seen in mummeries organised by his majesty\".<ref name=moma123/> A \u201cmummery\u201d was a late medieval courtly [[Masquerade ball|masquerade]] or costumed dance.<ref name=moma122>{{harvnb| Terjanian |2019|p=122}}</ref>\n\nThis developed into the commissioning of planning sketches for the entire work, created over the next ten years.<ref name=moma123/> They were drawn in pen on [[laid paper]], using brown and black ink with watercolour over black chalk and leadpoint.<ref name=moma123/> A collection of 203 of these are housed in the [[National Gallery of Art]] in [[Washington, D.C.]]<ref>{{harvnb| Terjanian |2019|pp=120, 123}}</ref> A small number of additional drawings are held at the [[British Museum]] and the [[Vatican Library]].<ref name=moma123/>\n\nMaximilian took a leading part in the creation of the work.<ref name=Clephan87>{{harvnb|Clephan|1995|p=87}}</ref> His instructions on the subjects to be illustrated as well as corrections, in his own hand, of some of the proofs have survived.

The narrative ends with Freydal setting out to search for her, and ''Theuerdank'' then takes up the subsequent story.<ref name=moma121/>\n\nThe work reflects Maximilian's vanity, as exemplified by a poem which forms part of the draft text:<ref name=\"Clephan 1995 88\"/>{{Quotation|This did the gallant Freydal<br>In knightly deeds of fame<br>Thus rendering illustrious<br>The glories of his name.<br>His virtues and his goodness<br>Are manifest to all;<br>His many glorious triumphs<br>At tilt, at masks and ball...<br>His like will ne\u2019er be seen again.<ref>translation {{harvnb|Clephan|1995|p=88, note 1}}</ref>}}\n\nHowever, the tournaments described are based on encounters Maximilian actually had. This is evidenced by a list of people involved in the story in the first seven [[Paper quire|quire]]s of the draft text, and who are known to have been actual courtiers.<ref name=Silver64/>\n\n===Illuminated manuscript tournament book===\n[[File:Freydal 02.jpg|upright=1.2|thumb|left|Freydal in a \u201cjoust of war with flying and exploding shields\u201d (''Geschifttartschen-Rennen'') with Sigmund von Welsperg (''Freydal'' ms. fol. 29, [[Kunsthistorisches Museum|KMW]])<ref>{{harvnb|Krause|2014|pp=175\u2013176}}</ref>]]\nThe miniatures in the tournament book manuscript illustrate the types of [[jousting]] popular at the time, both on horse and on foot.<ref name=McLaren/> Freydal features in each illustrated combat and his opponent is an historical figure with whom Maximilian actually jousted.<ref name=McLaren/> Each picture, in the lower margin, identifies the name of the opponent and the other courtiers depicted.<ref name=Locke123>{{harvnb|Locke|2015|p=123}}</ref>\n\nTwo types of joust, ''Rennen'' (or \u201cjousts of war\u201d where the lance has a sharpened tip<ref name= joust>{{harvnb|Jeep|2001|p=759}}; {{harvnb|Silver|2002|p=63}}</ref>) and ''Stechen'' (or \u201cjousts of peace\u201d where the lance has a blunted tip<ref name= joust/>) are depicted for each tournament.<ref name=Clephan87/><ref name=moma121/> Within these two broad groupings, eleven sub-types are shown.<ref name=moma121/> In the ''Welsches Gestecht'' (Italian joust of peace) a board separates the jousters so that they can ride more closely to each other and strike their opponent frontally with greater force. This results in a spectacular splintering of the lances. In the ''Scharfrennen'' (joust of war with flying shields) the shield is shown loosely fixed to the rider's breastplate, the aim being to dislodge it. In contrast, the objective of the ''Antzogenrennen'' is to unseat the opponent and his shield is fixed to his armour.<ref name=moma121/> The ''Feldrennen'' (or ''Kampfrennen'') jousts replicate skirmishes in war and the riders wear battlefield armour. The rarest type of joust depicted is the ''Kr\u00f6nlrennen'' where one rider wears the armour of a joust of peace but wields the lance of a joust of war and the other rider  has the opposite combination.<ref name=moma122/>\n\nOne of the most spectacular jousts depicted is the ''Bundrennen'' (joust of war with flying shields without [[bevors]])<ref name=moma121/> and its variation, ''Geschifttartschen-Rennen'' (joust of war with flying and exploding shields).<ref name=moma125>{{harvnb|Terjanian|2019|p=125}}</ref> In the ''Bundrennen'', the shield is held in place on the rider's breastplate with a complicated spring mechanism and when it is struck in the right place by the opponent it is ejected high into the air.<ref name=moma121/> The ''Geschifttartschen-Rennen'' increases the spectacle by attaching multiple triangular platelets to the shield which, when the shield is ejected, come loose and explode into the air like a firework display.<ref name=moma125/> Maximilian claimed to have invented this type of joust.<ref name=Freeman/> \n[[File:Freydal 05.jpg|upright=1.2|thumb|right|Foot combat between Freydal and Claude de Vaudry (''Freydal'' ms. fol. 39, [[Kunsthistorisches Museum|KMW]])<ref name=moma120/>]]\nIn each of the tournaments, the participants are shown engaging in a foot combat. A variety of weapons are used, including [[Mace (bludgeon)|iron clubs]] (''Eisenkolben''), [[Flail (weapon)|flails]] (''Drischel''), swords (''Turnierschwert'')<ref name=krause179>{{harvnb|Krause|2014|p=179}}</ref> and daggers.<ref name=krause181>{{harvnb|Krause|2014|p=181}}</ref> The ''[[Melee (tournament)|m\u00eal\u00e9e]]'' is also shown in the manuscript.<ref name=Clephan87/>\n\nAfter each of the sixty-four tournaments is a scene depicting a [[moresca]] (a pantomime dance) or other post-tournament festivities with male courtiers, including the knights who had competed in the tournament, dressing up to dance in a variety of exotic costumes.<ref name=Locke121/> Known as \u2018mummeries\u2019, these were a regular feature of the evening entertainment after tournaments.<ref name=moma122/>\n\nThe male courtiers in the mummeries in the manuscript dress up, amongst other things, in costumes based on nationality or ethnicity, for example [[Ottoman Turks|Turkish]], [[Republic of Venice|Venetian]] or [[Burgundian Netherlands|Burgundian]] costume, or as animals such as [[apes]] and creatures with bird's heads.<ref name=Locke121/> In one masquerade illustrated, the male participants engage in [[cross-dressing]] and wear women's gowns.<ref name=moma122/>\n\nIn each scene, all the men are dressed in the same costume and normally wear a mask.

Not only is it the largest surviving tournament book, it is also an unparalleled pictorial source of jousting from the late medieval period.<ref>{{harv|Terjanian|2019|pp=120-121}}</ref> It is the only one to depict spectacular falls.<ref name=Freeman/> In addition to illustrating the jousts themselves, it represents a remarkable catalogue of the weaponry used during tournaments<ref name=Freeman/> and is the most extensive record of mummery, the early court masquerade, that exists.<ref name=moma122/> The manuscript has been recognised in [[UNESCO]]\u2019s [[Memory of the World]] programme.<ref>{{harv|Taschen Catalogue}}</ref>\n\nHowever, ''Freydal'' was intended to be not only an artistic work but also political propaganda.<ref>{{harv|Barber|1974|p=298}}</ref> As part of what he called his \u2018memorial projects\u2019 or ''Gedechtnus'', Maximilian I used literary and visual works to model and enhance his public image.

M\u00fcller]] ([[:de:Jan-Dirk M\u00fcller |de]]) has said, ''Freydal'' and the other works of ''Gedechtnus'' meant that Maximilian\u2019s court \u201cliterally existed on paper: to a large extent it

She was created by [[John Byrne (comics)|John Byrne]] and first appeared in ''[[Wonder Woman]]'' (vol. 2) #105 (January 1996). The second Wonder Girl, Cassie is a sidekick of [[Wonder Woman]] and has been featured as a member of the [[Teen Titans]].\n\nWhen Cassie was introduced, she was the daughter of an archaeologist, Dr. [[Helena Sandsmark]], a friend of Wonder Woman's. To help Wonder Woman during an adventure, she borrowed magical artifacts which bestowed upon Cassie superpowers, with which she fought crime as Wonder Girl. Later, [[Zeus (DC Comics)|Zeus]], king of the Greek gods, grants her real powers. Later revelations showed that Cassie was in fact a [[demigod]]dess and the natural daughter of Zeus and Dr. Helena.<ref name=\"ww105\">''Wonder Woman'' (vol. 2) #105 (1996)</ref>\n\nIn 2011, DC relaunched its books with a new continuity called [[The New 52]], and one of its major continuity changes was to Wonder Woman, establishing that she is a demigod and the daughter of Zeus. Cassie is reintroduced in the pages of ''Teen Titans'' as a superpowered thief with enchanted demonic bracelets; she is recruited into the Teen Titans superhero group by [[Tim Drake|Red Robin]], the former prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of the superhero [[Batman]], and has no obvious connection to Wonder Woman. Later, she learns that she is Wonder Woman's niece and Zeus's granddaughter. Her father is revealed as being a British super-soldier named Lennox Sandsmark who is Wonder Woman's half-brother and himself a son of Zeus. As before, Helen, Cassie's mother, is an archaeologist.<ref>''Teen Titans'' Vol 4 #19 (June 2013). DC Comics.</ref>\n\n==Publication history==\nCassandra Sandsmark initially appears as a supporting cast member in ''[[Wonder Woman]].'' She later appears as part of an ensemble in ''[[Young Justice]]'' and ''[[Teen Titans]]''. She appeared in supporting roles in ''[[52 (comics)|52]]'', ''[[Supergirl (comic book)|Supergirl]]'', and the [[Publication history of Wonder Woman|2006 relaunch of the ''Wonder Woman'' series]]. In September 2007, she appeared in the six-issue limited series ''Wonder Girl: Champion''<ref>[http://forum.newsarama.com/showthread.php?t=116901 Newsarama.com: HEROES CON/WW PHILLY '07: J. TORRES ON WONDER GIRL: CHAMPION - NEWSARAMA] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070619143724/http://forum.newsarama.com/showthread.php?t=116901 |date=2007-06-19 }}</ref> written by [[J. Torres]] and illustrated by Sanford Greene and [[Nathan Massengill]].\n\n==Fictional character biography==\nCassandra is the third character to be called Wonder Girl, the second being [[Donna Troy]], following the earlier stories of a young [[Wonder Woman]] using the name. Cassandra is the daughter of Dr. [[Helena Sandsmark]], (an archaeologist with whom Wonder Woman was working) and the [[Greek mythology|Greek god]] [[Zeus]].<ref name=\"ww105\"/> During a fight with a [[Doomsday (comics)|Doomsday clone]]<ref name=\"ww111\">''Wonder Woman'' (vol. 2) #111 (1996)</ref> and another battle with Decay,<ref name=\"ww113\">''Wonder Woman'' (vol. 2) #113 (1996)</ref> she created a costume and used magical accoutrements (the sandals of [[Hermes]] and the gauntlet of [[Atlas (mythology)|Atlas]]) to help Wonder Woman, much to her mother's horror. Cassandra later had the opportunity to ask Zeus for a boon,<ref name=\"ww122-123\">''Wonder Woman'' (vol. 2) #122-123 (1997)</ref> and requested real superpowers. Zeus granted her request, but gave Dr. Sandsmark the ability to deactivate them with the simple touch of her hand upon Cassie. Dr. Sandsmark, however, reluctantly accepted her daughter's wish to be a superhero and rarely if ever uses this ability.\n\n===Young Justice===\n{{see also|Young Justice}}\nCassie heavily idolized [[Donna Troy]], the original [[Wonder Girl]], and to that effect wore a black wig over her natural blonde hair (it also helped to conceal her identity). Donna gave Cassie the second costume she wore as Wonder Girl, but Cassie was afraid to wear it lest it were ruined. She has been trained by [[Artemis of Bana-Mighdall|Artemis]], the former \"stand-in\" Wonder Woman.<ref>''Wonder Woman'' (vol. 2) #142-158</ref> As Wonder Girl, Cassie joined [[Young Justice]]<ref name=\"yj4\">''Young Justice'' #4 (1999)</ref> due to her crush on [[Superboy (Kon-El)|Superboy]]. She became close friends with [[Arrowette]], [[Secret (Greta Hayes)|Secret]], and [[Empress (comics)|Empress]]. During her time with that group the dark god [[Titans of Myth (comics)#Children of Cronus|Oblivion]] caused Wonder Woman's Wonder Dome palace to destroy Gateway City. Artemis ordered Cassie to help with crowd control instead of wasting time putting on her Wonder Girl disguise. Agreeing with her, Cassie revealed her secret identity before news cameras for the first time in her superhero career.<ref>''Wonder Woman'' Vol. 2, issues 140 and 141.</ref> Towards the end of the Young Justice series, Cassie became the leader of the team, after beating Robin during an election for command due to inner team tension following the recent revelation of [[Batman]]'s [[JLA: Tower of Babel|security protocols against the rest of the Justice League]], YJ uncomfortable with the idea that Robin had similar plans to use on them. Her secret identity was again publicly revealed when the second [[Silver Swan (comics)|Silver Swan]] attacked her at her high school.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}}\n\nYoung Justice was disbanded after the events of ''[[Titans/Young Justice: Graduation Day|Graduation Day]]'',<ref name=\"t/yj\">''Titans/Young Justice: Graduation Day'' (1999)</ref> a crossover with ''Titans''. During these events, [[List of DC Comics teams and organizations#O|Optitron]] offered to fund both the Titans and Young Justice. Donna Troy was seemingly killed by a rogue [[Superman]] android, leaving Cassie shaken and causing both teams to disband.\n\n===Teen Titans===\n{{see also|Teen Titans|Superboy (Kon-El)|Robin (Tim Drake)|Bart Allen}}\n\nCassie later joined some former members of Young Justice in the newest incarnation of the Teen Titans.<ref name=\"tt1\">''Teen Titans'' (vol. 3) #1 (2003)</ref> Early on, she was gifted with a lasso<ref name=\"tt2\">''Teen Titans'' (vol. 3) #2 (2003)</ref> by [[Ares (DC Comics)|Ares]], the Greek god of war and frequent enemy of Wonder Woman and the Amazons. Despite appearing similar to Wonder Woman's lasso, Cassie's expels Zeus' [[lightning]] when used in anger.<ref name=\"tt6\">''Teen Titans'' (vol. 3) #6 (2003)</ref> Over the course of the series, Ares often appeared to Wonder Girl to warn her about \"[[Infinite Crisis|the coming war]]\".<ref name=\"tt2\"/><ref name=\"tt8\">''Teen Titans'' (vol. 3) #8 (2003)</ref><ref name=\"tt15\">''Teen Titans'' (vol. 3) #15 (2004)</ref> During her time with the Titans, Cassie also developed a relationship with Superboy, whom she had harbored feelings before and throughout ''Young Justice''.\n\nIn \"[[Titans Tomorrow]]\",<ref name=\"titanstomorrow\">\"[[Titans Tomorrow]]\": ''Teen Titans'' (vol. 3) #17\u201319 (2005)</ref> the Titans are thrown ten years into their future, where they encountered future versions of themselves. In this future, Cassie inherited the mantle of Wonder Woman after Diana was killed during \"the Crisis\". She is also referred to as \"Ares' champion\", and is in a relationship with [[Superboy (Kon-El)|Conner Kent]] ([[Superboy (Kon-El)|Superboy]]). It is not revealed whether they are married or merely dating.\n\nIt was also during her Titans membership that she was revealed to be Zeus' daughter, a fact both Zeus and her mother kept from her for most of her life. Cassie was originally told by her mother that her biological father had died. Wonder Woman knew about Cassie's link to Zeus but chose to hide this from Cassie as well at the request of Cassie's mother. In \"The Insiders\",<ref name=\"insiderstt\">\"The Insiders\": ''Teen Titans'' (vol. 3) #24\u201325 (2005)</ref><ref name=\"insidersos\">\"The Insiders\":''Outsiders'' (vol. 3) #24\u201325 (2005)</ref> she was beaten by Superboy as a result of his possession by [[Lex Luthor]]; though she recovered, Superboy secluded himself at the Kent farm in [[Smallville (comics)|Smallville]],<ref name=\"tt26\">''Teen Titans'' (vol. 3) #26 (2005)</ref><ref name=\"ic1\">''Infinite Crisis'' #1 (2005)</ref><ref name=\"sg2\">''Supergirl'' (vol. 5) #2 (2005)</ref> and there had seemed to be a strain on their relationship until the events of ''Infinite Crisis''.\n\nWhen the Teen Titans and the [[Outsiders (comics)|Outsiders]] learned that Donna Troy was still alive in ''The Return of Donna Troy'', Cassie was among the heroes that traveled to the planet Minosyss to reunite with her. Having had false memories implanted by the Titans of Myth, Donna savagely beat Cassie, until Cassie was able to restore her true memories.<ref name=\"dt\">''The Return of Donna Troy'' #3 (2005)</ref>\n\n===Infinite Crisis===\n{{see also|Infinite Crisis|Character changes during Infinite Crisis}}\n[[Image:titans annual.jpg|200px|thumb|left|''Teen Titans Annual'' #1<br>Cover art by [[Ed Benes]]]]\nDuring a battle against [[Brother Blood]] and a handful of zombie Titans, she acknowledged that her powers were fluctuating and sometimes disappearing altogether.<ref name=\"tt30-31\">''Teen Titans'' (vol. 3) #30\u201331 (2005)</ref> Despite this, Cassie attempted to help [[Superboy]] after he was beaten to near-death by [[Superboy-Prime]]<ref name=\"ic4\">''Infinite Crisis'' #4 (2006)</ref><ref>''Teen Titans'' (vol. 3) #32 (2006)</ref> After saving him, Wonder Girl and the Titans infiltrated a [[LexCorp]] laboratory to find a way to cure Superboy.<ref name=\"r146-47\">''Robin'' #146\u201347 (2006)</ref> While the other Titans flew to Bl\u00fcdhaven following an attack from the Society, Cassie remained at Titans Tower to watch over Superboy.

Conner then took Cassie to Smallville, and, afraid that it would be their last night together, they consummate their love.<ref name=\"ttannual\">''Teen Titans Annual'' #1 (2006)</ref>\n\nAres again appears to her and informed that the reason behind her weakening power was Zeus taking back the powers he had granted to her as he left the mortal plane. Ares then offered Cassie some of his power in exchange for becoming his champion and acknowledging him as her brother.<ref name=\"tt33\">''Teen Titans'' (vol. 3) #33</ref> She joins Superboy and Nightwing up north, with powers returned, to assist in the assault on [[Alexander Luthor, Jr.|Lex Luthor]]'s tower. Superboy sacrificed his life to defeat Superboy-Prime and destroy the tower, and died.<ref name=\"ic6\">''Infinite Crisis'' #6 (2006)</ref>\n\n===The Cult of Conner===\n{{see also|52 (comics)}}\nDirectly after Infinite Crisis, the Teen Titans fall apart. Cassie, feeling abandoned by her best friends, leaves the Titans during the year in which ''[[52 (comics)|52]]'' takes place, following Robin's departure. Cassie becomes involved in a [[cult]] heavily influenced by [[Krypton (comics)|Kryptonian]] culture. She sets up an altar in [[Titans Tower]] with Kryptonian crystals and a gold figure with the Superman-insignia, which means \"hope\" in Kryptonian. Soon, [[Elongated Man|Ralph Dibny]] approaches her because someone defaced the grave of his wife [[Sue Dibny|Sue]] with an upside down 'S' Shield, which in Kryptonian means \"resurrection\".\n\nAbout five days later, Cassie and her fellow cult members meet with Ralph. Cassie mentions that it was another member, [[Dev-Em]], who led her to join. Cassie explains that the goal of the cult is to resurrect Superboy. As a test of their process, they intend to resurrect [[Sue Dibny]]. Cassie and Ralph attend a ceremony designed to resurrect Sue, but Ralph grows suspicious and with the help of other superheroes, disrupts the ceremony, destroying the Kryptonite which was essential to the process. Cassie leaves with Dev-Em, blaming Ralph for destroying her chances to resurrect Superboy. After stopping [[Weather Wizard]] in Metropolis, Cassie meets [[Booster Gold#52 and Supernova|Supernova]] and refers to him incorrectly as Kon-El, who actually turns out to be Booster Gold in disguise.\n\n===One Year Later===\n{{main|One Year Later}}\nDuring \"One Year Later\", Wonder Girl is seen attempting to stop [[Gemini (DC Comics)|Gemini]] of the [[Brotherhood of Evil]] from escaping [[S.T.A.R. Labs]] with valuable technology, revealing that she had been following the Brotherhood for some time. She also sports a new costume influenced by that of the late Superboy. She now wears a [[Golden Age of Comic Books|Golden Age]] Wonder Woman-themed [[t-shirt]] and [[denim]] [[jeans]].<ref name=\"tt34\">''Teen Titans'' (vol. 3) #34 (2006)</ref>\n\nShe temporarily rejoins the team,<ref name=\"tt35\">''Teen Titans'' (vol. 3) #35 (2006)</ref> under the suggestion of [[Cyborg (comics)|Cyborg]] so that they may combine forces to defeat the [[Brotherhood of Evil]]. After the Teen Titans and [[Doom Patrol]] defeat the Brotherhood of Evil, she decides to rejoin the team permanently. When she goes to tell Robin of her decision, she discovers his secretive and unsuccessful attempts to bring back Superboy. Though obsessed with having Conner back, Cassie reacts in horror and in an attempt to quell Robin's anger at Cassie, the two kiss. For a while the two refused to talk about the incident beyond coming to the agreement that it was a mistake, but they both have discussed it with others.<ref name=\"ww4\">''Wonder Woman'' (vol. 4) #4 (2007)</ref><ref name=\"sg11\">''Supergirl'' (vol. 5) #11 (2007)</ref><ref name=\"sg12\">''Supergirl'' (vol. 5) #12 (2007)</ref> With her life in disarray, Cassie has been having difficulty with her personal life, often having major confrontations with her mother. Cassie has gained a new friendship with the recently returned Supergirl, [[Supergirl (Kara Zor-El)|Kara Zor-El]], who has shared with her in mourning the loss of Superboy and Paradise Island.<ref name=\"sg10\">''Supergirl'' (vol. 5) #10 (2006)</ref>\n\nCassie was also still very furious at Wonder Woman following the events of ''[[Infinite Crisis]]'', due to her belief that Wonder Woman abandoned her after Conner's death to play secret agent in a new civilian identity that [[Batman]] created for her after Infinite Crisis. She was also not pleased that Robin was aware of Diana's whereabouts during the year after Infinite Crisis and did not inform her about it. Diana and Cassie have not been able to discuss their past differences, leading to Cassie to turn to Supergirl and the now resurrected [[Donna Troy]] instead for emotional support dealing with Conner's death.\n\nFollowing the resurrection of [[Jericho (comics)|Jericho]] at the hands of Raven, Wonder Girl and Robin request that Raven use the same ceremony to resurrect Superboy. Raven calmly explains that is not possible, because Jericho's resurrection was a special case: Jericho's soul was still on Earth, imprisoned inside of a computer disk, while Conner's has moved on to the afterlife. In the middle of this conversation with [[Robin (Tim Drake)|Robin]] and [[Raven (DC Comics)|Raven]], Wonder Girl is captured by [[Deathstroke]]'s villainous [[Titans East]] after an attack by [[Inertia (DC Comics)|Inertia]] and [[Match (DC Comics)|Match]]. Each member of Titans East has been recruited to negate a specific Titan. Deathstroke selected Match, a Bizarro-type clone of Superboy, to counter Wonder Girl due to his strength and his warped visage as being a psychological edge against her.<ref name=\"tt43\">''Teen Titans'' (vol. 3) #43 (2007)</ref>\n\nThe Titans battle furiously against the Titans East, during which they are able to convince [[Cassandra Cain|Batgirl]] and [[Duela Dent]] to switch sides. Unfortunately the team is defeated by Slade's team a second time. However, Raven, Cyborg, and Duela Dent manage to get aid from [[Dick Grayson|Nightwing]], Donna Troy, [[Beast Boy]], and Flash (Bart Allen). Together the Titans defeat Slade, who along with Inertia, manages to escape. During the fight Jericho possess Match, and the team is reluctant to release Match due to the danger he poses.\n\nIn the ''[[Countdown to Final Crisis|Countdown]]'' limited series, Cassie attends [[Bart Allen]]'s funeral and during a heated and controversial eulogy, she vows to get revenge for Bart's death.\n\nCassie then becomes involved in the [[Amazons Attack!|Amazon's attack on Washington D.C.]] Supergirl and Wonder Girl discover that their friends and family have been placed in an internment camp due to their ties to the Amazons. After a failed attempt to aid them, the two heroes agree to bring the U.S. President to [[Hippolyta (DC Comics)|Queen Hippolyta]] in order to stop the war. They are ambushed by a group of Amazons in the process, which causes the President to become mortally wounded. The actions of the Amazons and Wonder Girl's own involvement cause public outcry against all those who have followed in Wonder Woman's footsteps. Ultimately Cassie declares that despite her training and past that she is not an Amazon, preferring her ties to the Teen Titans over that of the Amazons.<ref>''Teen Titans'' (vol. 3) #49</ref> Accepting her decision, [[Artemis of Bana-Mighdall|Artemis]] wishes her well and leaves Cassie to her devices. Wonder Girl celebrates by sharing another kiss with Robin in front of her teammates.\n\nIn the months following the kiss, Cassie and Tim continue to go through 'will-they-won't-they' moments in which they both continue to question the validity of their relationship.{{Issue|date=October 2008}} Then following a battle against an army of future Titans, the pair decided at last to date. Unfortunately, their relationship is short-lived, as after their first official date Cassie ends the relationship, because she feels she is using Tim.<ref name=\"tt55\">''Teen Titans'' (vol. 3) #55 (2008)</ref> This has resulted in a growing animosity between the pair, which has begun to bleed into their relationships with the other Titans.{{Issue|date=October 2008}}\n\n====''Huntress''====\n[[Image:ArmoredCassie.jpg|thumb|right|Cassie in her Amazon armor.<br>Art by [[Aaron Lopresti]].]]Wonder Girl recently appeared in a six-issue self-titled mini-series written by [[J. Torres]] and with art and covers by Sanford Greene and [[Nathan Massengill]]. In this series, Wonder Girl attempts to make up for the mistakes made by the Amazons on her own. Cassie adopts a secret identity, taking up the name \"Drusilla\" (the same name used by Wonder Girl in the '70s [[Wonder Woman (TV series)|''Wonder Woman'' television series]]). However, as she attempts to apprehend a group of mystical beasts left over from the Amazons' attack, she finds herself confronted by her half-brother [[Hercules (DC Comics)|Hercules]], who claims to want to help her become a true champion of the gods and to rebuild Olympus. Cassie is reluctant to trust him. Hercules persists and chases after Cassie, taking the form of Superboy in order to get her attention.\n\nTogether, Hercules and Cassie try to discover who is attacking the remaining Olympian gods. Soon into their search they are attacked by the [[Female Furies]]. Hercules stops the fight by explaining that he has allied with the Furies in hopes of rescuing the gods, or, failing that, starting a new pantheon with them. The Furies have their own plans and are only using Hercules to get to Wonder Girl. The Furies soon betray Hercules, with [[Bloody Mary (DC Comics)|Bloody Mary]] using her bite to gain power over Hercules, forcing him to do what the Furies want. The Furies then kidnap Cassie's mother to lure her into a trap. Aided by the [[Olympian (comics)|Olympian]], Wonder Girl goes into battle, being forced to fight her own brother. The Teen Titans, Empress, Arrowette and Wonder Woman show up to help. After Bloody Mary is murdered by the [[New Gods|New Gods killer]], Hercules is freed from her spell and immediately saves Wonder Girl from being kidnapped by the Furies. Hercules goes free after he reveals he is now a demi-god and that Zeus released him to help stop \"[[Countdown to Final Crisis|the Great Disaster]]\". Hercules then leaves to perform certain \"labors\".\n\nThe series ends with Cassie reconciling with Wonder Woman, who tells Cassie that she has become her own woman.\n\nCassie is later attacked by her nephew [[Lycus (DC Comics)|Lycus]], the son of Ares. He attempts to take her title as Ares' avatar, along with her power. Although he is successful in stealing Cassie's powers derived from Ares, Cassie discovers that she no longer needs to be blessed with powers from the gods as she willed her own innate power to surface. Cassie now possesses a high level of super-strength all her own.\n\nRobin ultimately makes the decision to leave the Teen Titans for an undetermined length of time in the aftermath of [[Batman R.I.P]], leaving Cassie with the task of assembling and leading a new team. After an unsuccessful attempt at having Kid Devil recruit teen metahumans such as [[Klarion]], [[Shining Knight]], and the teen members of the [[Justice Society of America]], Cassie eventually gains three new Titans in [[Static (DC Comics)|Static]], [[Aquagirl (Lorena Marquez)|Aquagirl]], and [[Kid Eternity]]. Kid Eternity's ability to summon the spirits of the deceased briefly tempts Cassie, who considers having him summon Conner's spirit. However, she eventually decides against it, telling Eternity never to grant her such a request, even if she were to beg him.<ref>''Teen Titans'' #71</ref>\n\nSome months later, between the [[Final Crisis]] and the [[Blackest Night]], Cassie becomes aware of Conner's rebirth by [[Final Crisis: Legion of 3 Worlds|Brainiac 5's hand]]. Despite meeting him briefly at his return,<ref>''Final Crisis: Legion of 3 Worlds'' #5 (2009)</ref> Cassie decides to wait, until [[Ma and Pa Kent|Martha Kent]] herself, now sheltering Conner at her place, invites Cassie for dinner, essentially granting Cassie and Conner a date. At first skeptical and fearing to ''end as [[Lana Lang]]'', basically forgotten and replaced as Conner relocated to Smallville and gained a new circle of friends, she's touched by Conner opening his heart to her about her fears and dreams for their future life, and thus decides to tell Conner about herself and Tim Drake. Conner quickly forgives her, arguing that even if Cassie still loves him, she could not have known of his impending resurrection in the immediate aftermath of the Infinite Crisis, so she has nothing to blame. Happily, Cassie accepts to rekindle their relationship.<ref name=\"Adv2\">''Adventure Comics'' (vol. 2) #2 (September 2009)</ref>\n\nDue to personal responsibilities, neither Conner nor Bart return to the Teen Titans, though Wonder Girl still continues to lead. However, following the demise of [[Kid Devil]], Cassie begins questioning her leadership and begins to make mistakes. During a massive battle with [[Cinderblock (comics)|Cinderblock]] in downtown San Francisco, Wonder Girl refuses to let her team attack the villain directly, causing massive destruction to the area. The heroes continue in their fruitless stalemate until Beast Boy arrives and takes command of the team, leading to their victory. In the aftermath of the battle, Beast Boy tells Cassie that she has to stop dwelling on Devil's death or else more innocent people are going to get hurt, something she does not take kindly.<ref>''Titans'' (vol. 2) #17 (August 2009)</ref>\n\nA few days later, Beast Boy makes the decision to move back into Titans Tower and replace Cassie as the head of the team, declaring that they need a more experienced leader to get back on track. Though Cassie initially says nothing about this, she ultimately becomes angry and tells Beast Boy that no one asked for his help, and that she can lead the team just fine. Beast Boy simply replies by saying that the Teen Titans need help, and that everyone, including Cyborg, think so.<ref>''Teen Titans'' (vol. 3) #75-76 (September\u2013October 2009)</ref>\n\n===Blackest Night===\nDuring the events of ''[[Blackest Night]]'', Cassie joins Kid Flash and Beast Boy as part of a small group of past and present Titans who assemble at Titans Tower. Lacking assistance from Static, Miss Martian, Blue Beetle, [[Bombshell (DC Comics)|Bombshell]], and Aquagirl (each of whom are presumably defending other cities), the team barely survives the onslaught.<ref>''Blackest Night: Titans'' #1-3</ref>\n\nAfter [[Dawn Granger]] uses her abilities to destroy the Black Lanterns, Cassie and the others travel to [[Coast City]] in order to assist [[Flash (Barry Allen)|Barry Allen]] and [[Hal Jordan]] in their battle with [[Nekron]], the leader of the Black Lantern Corps. To the horror of the gathered heroes, Nekron uses his abilities to transform several once-dead heroes into Black Lanterns, including Superboy, Kid Flash, Donna, and Wonder Woman.<ref>''Blackest Night'' #5 (November 2009)</ref> In the ensuing battle, Cassie is killed when Donna Troy violently tears her heart out. However, it is then revealed that the entire battle was an imagination of Wonder Woman, and Cassie is shown to still be alive.<ref>''Blackest Night: Wonder Woman'' #2 (January 2010)</ref> When Black Lantern Conner attacks Cassie, all the while attempting to break free from the Black Ring's control, Conner manages to break the control in temporary, short lapses, which he uses to alert Cassie about the solution to his Black Ring problem. The battle moves to the fortress, where Cassie realizes what Conner was referring to when he told them to move to the [[Fortress of Solitude]] Conner's corpse, placed where he awaits his resurrection in ''[[Final Crisis: Legion of 3 Worlds|Legion of Three Worlds]]''. The Black Ring, confused, leaves the living Conner and tries to attach itself to his corpse, but Conner awakens his freeze breath ability, which freezes the ring, and Cassie throws it into orbit. After reconciling, the pair heads back to Coast City for the final battle with Nekron's army.<ref>''Adventure Comics'' (vol. 2) #7 (February 2010)</ref>\n\n===Return of Conner===\nAfter this, Cassie travels to New York to confront Cyborg about Beast Boy's statements. He assures her that she is capable of leading the Titans, and she returns to the team and admits to them that she is done moping over Conner and Eddie. She then leads the team to the city of Dakota in order to rescue Static, who had been kidnapped by a superhuman gangster named [[Holocaust (DC Comics)|Holocaust]].<ref>''Teen Titans'' (vol. 3) #79 (January 2010)</ref> After hearing about a battle between Static and Holocaust in downtown Dakota, Cassie arrives on the scene with Bombshell and Aquagirl. The three heroines are easily defeated and captured by Holocaust, who then informs them that he plans on killing them and weaponizing their powers in order to sell. Beast Boy and the other Titans arrive at the compound to retrieve their comrades, but end up being overpowered and defeated themselves. At the last second, Cyborg bursts into the compound with Superboy and Kid Flash, preparing to rescue the other Titans.<ref>''Teen Titans'' #80-81</ref> Cassie is soon freed, and assists Superboy in holding off Holocaust while the other Titans make their escape. In the final battle, Cassie uses her lasso to bind the villain, allowing Kid Flash to finish him off by sending him plummeting into the Earth's inner core (though thanks to his superhuman durability, Static remarks that the core would not kill him). On the plane ride back to San Francisco, Conner remarks that Cassie seems to be ignoring him, and she simply responds by telling him that he is correct.<ref>''Teen Titans'' #82</ref>\n\nCassie later travels to Gotham City alongside several of her fellow Titans after [[Ra's al Ghul]] begins targeting people close to Tim Drake. She attempts to rescue [[Barbara Gordon]] from members of the [[League of Assassins]], but arrives to find that she has already defeated the men that attempted to kill her.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://dcu.blog.dccomics.com/files/2010/04/rrob_12_dylux-5-copy.jpg |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-04-30 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111026180144/http://dcu.blog.dccomics.com/files/2010/04/rrob_12_dylux-5-copy.jpg |archivedate=2011-10-26}}</ref>\n\nDuring the events of ''[[Brightest Day]]'', Cassie confronts a recently resurrected Titan by the name of [[Osiris (DC Comics)#Amon Tomaz|Osiris]] when he arrives at Titans Tower, looking for help from his former teammates. Cassie tries to convince Osiris to turn himself over to the police for the murdering the [[Persuader (comics)|Persuader]] during ''52'', but he angrily brushes her off and flees before Cassie can contact the authorities. [[Blue Beetle (Jaime Reyes)|Blue Beetle]] asks if the Titans should go after him, but Cassie simply replies by saying that Osiris will return, and then rhetorically asks, \"[[Teen Titans#Brightest Day: Titans- Villains for Hire|where else can he go?]]\"<ref>''Titans'' (vol. 2) #24</ref>\n\nAfter a disastrous mission to another dimension in order to rescue Raven, the Titans are torn asunder. Miss Martian is rendered comatose, Static is left temporarily depowered, and Aquagirl and Bombshell are missing and presumed dead at sea. Despite her pleas for Static to stay, Wonder Girl is ultimately left with a roster consisting of only herself, Superboy, Kid Flash, Raven, and Beast Boy.<ref>''Teen Titans'' (vol. 3) #87</ref> A short time after this, the Titans rescue Bombshell and Aquagirl, who are both removed from the team by Wonder Girl. When asked about this decision (as well as the subsequent choice to invite the unstable [[Rose Wilson]] back into the team), Wonder Girl states that Kid Devil's death has forced her to realize that inexperienced teen heroes have no place on the team. At the same time, she admits to Conner that she is having trouble reconciling her knowledge as a leader with her fear of losing him again.<ref>''Teen Titans'' (vol. 3) #88</ref>\n\n===One-shot===\n{{update|date=February 2012}}\nIn January 2011, Wonder Girl was given a one-shot, which was written by [[JT Krul]], drawn by [[Adriana Melo]], and covered by [[Nicola Scott]].,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=28948|title=DC Comics Solicitations for January, 2011|accessdate=13 October 2014}}</ref>\n\n===The New 52===\n{{update|date=August 2017}}\nIn September 2011, [[The New 52]] rebooted DC's continuity. In this new timeline, Cassie Sandsmark is reintroduced in the ''[[Teen Titans]]'' series. This version of Cassie, who dislikes being called \"Wonder Girl\", started out as a teenage thief, who started at the age of sixteen and lost touch with her mother, who stole a pair of enchanted bracelets from a temple before meeting [[Tim Drake|Red Robin]]. Living in Hollywood surviving on a crime spree and bought a little house with the money she made. She first crossed paths with Red Robin after she was rescued from an organization called N.O.W.H.E.R.E, who were capturing young teenagers who were developing [[Metahuman| Metahuman]] abilities for their own nefarious purposes. She caught the organization's attention when her exploits were attaching attention her from the media which they dubbed her \"Wonder Girl\". She stole a car but was later pulled by a police officer in the Pacific Coast Highway, the latter was revealed to be an agent of N.O.W.H.E.R.E. and tried to capture her but Red Robin intervened. Red Robin was tracking down N.O.W.H.E.R.E and news coverage of teenagers with abilities and their action such as in New Mexico, a Mexican teenager boy who can make energy constructs and is calling himself [[Bunker|Bunker(comics)]] is arrested by state police only to later escape custody, in Westchester, New York, [[Kid Flash|Bart Allen]] had interrupted a news coverage of a fire in an abandoned mansion to announce himself to the world. The fire department had the blaze under control but then overhears one of the fire marshals being trapped on the roof so he rushes into the flames to save him but in his haste he forgets about backdraft and opening the door to the balcony and causes a massive explosion of fire. Kid Flash, knocked unconscious, is held responsible for bringing the blaze to an uncontrollable peak, News reports of a \"[[Beast Boy|Beast Boy]]\" who could shape shift into any animal, and many others such as reports of a missing [[ teenage girl from India who could manipulate light |Solstice (comics)]], A teen hero calling himself [[Static (DC Comics)|Static]] is seen in NYC, a boy posted pictures of a sexy orange girl with fiery hair ([[Starfire (Teen Titans)|Starfire]]) in a purple bikini he spotted in [[Martinique|Martinique]] on his online social media account, and photos a \"[[Martian Girl]]\" in a lecture by Lex Luther about aliens on earth.<ref>''Teen Titans'' (vol. 4) #2</ref> She is later revealed to be the daughter of Helen, an archaeologist who reputation was destroyed when Cassie stole the bracelets which resulted in the death of one of Helen's colleagues, who was Cassandra's one time love interest and mentor in stealing, and Lennox Sandsmark, a British super-soldier, who left the family when Cassie was only four years old.<ref>''Teen Titans'' Vol 4 #13 (December 2012)</ref> As Lennox is a demigod son of Zeus, and also a half-brother of Wonder Woman, Cassie, for the first time, is related to Wonder Woman.<ref>''Teen Titans'' Vol 4 #19 (June 2013)</ref>\n\n===Rebirth===\nIn the Super Sons of Tomorrow crossover, the version of Cassie Sandmark from the Titans Tomorrow future briefly arrived in the present timeline of Rebirth alongside other members of the Titans of Tomorrow.\n\nIn [[Young Justice]] #2, Zeus refers to Cassie as \"the future of the pantheon of the gods\". As part of her birthright, Zeus offers her a necklace that is said to contain immense powers. However, Cassie decides to hold off on taking this gift until she does something to truly earn it. Zeus calls her a \"giant pain, just like her mother\".\n\n==Powers and abilities==\nCassandra originally received her powers from a number of mystical artifacts employed by [[Artemis of Bana-Mighdall|Artemis]] during her time as Wonder Woman. These included the Gauntlet of [[Atlas (mythology)|Atlas]] and the Sandals of [[Hermes]], which provided her with the powers of strength and speed/flight, respectively.<ref name=\"ww111\"/> She was eventually granted similar abilities by [[Zeus]] as \"her fondest wish\".<ref name=\"ww122-123\" /> Discouraged by previously shown arrogance in his children ([[Ares (DC Comics)|Ares]] and [[Hercules (DC Comics)|Heracles]]), Zeus also blessed Cassandra's mother with the ability to take away her powers for a short time via a simple touch.<ref name=\"ww122-123\"/>\n\nShortly after joining the Teen Titans, Ares approached her and gave Cassandra her own magic lasso.<ref name=\"tt2\"/> Unlike Wonder Woman's [[Lasso of Truth]], Cassandra's is a weapon which channels Zeus' lightning when she becomes angry.<ref name=\"tt6\"/> When the Greek gods left the mortal plane as a result of the events of ''Infinite Crisis'', taking Cassandra's powers along with them, Ares offered her some of his power, saying that she would be \"more powerful than [she's] ever been\". What this entails is not made entirely clear, though she appeared to have retained all of her former abilities.<ref name=\"ic6\"/><ref name=\"tt34\"/> In a storyline taking place \"[[One Year Later]]\", Cassie was shown catching a falling [[Jet aircraft|jet]], which she was surprised at being able to accomplish.<ref name=\"tt40\">''Teen Titans'' (vol. 3) #40 (2006)</ref> However, while trying to stop the military from detaining her mother, Ares causes her powers to fluctuate when he believes she is wasting them on frivolous matters.{{Issue|date=October 2008}}\n\nIn the end, Ares was not pleased with Cassandra as his champion. He returned another to take her place. During a battle with Ares' son, King Lycus, who also drew power from him, Cassie was able to cast away her connection to the war god, and tap into her own powers as a demi-god (like her brother Heracles). Her real powers increased to an even greater level of strength than before. Currently, having tapped into her own demi-goddess powers, Cassie is an Olympian powerhouse. Although, she is not as powerful as Wonder Woman or Donna Troy, Cassie is still a  powerful young woman. Her lasso has apparently also changed, enabling her to turn Lycus to dust with a simple order.\n\nCassie was trained by the Amazon Artemis and is extremely well trained in the use of various weapons and in various martial arts. She is also a very capable leader and strategist.\n\nAfter the New 52 reboot, Cassie's powers have changed yet again. Her powers are now derived from the \"Silent Armor\" that she wears, which was forged in the heart of a sun and is apparently related to the demon known as Trigon. The armor is invisible unless she summons it or is in a combat situation, but she is always able to use its powers. The armor usually appears as a glittering red bodysuit, golden gauntlets and, occasionally, a hood. The armor grants her powers similar to those of her pre-reboot counterpart such as superhuman strength (sufficient enough for her to fight against Superboy for a short time), durability (though she is still vulnerable to piercing weapons), superhuman reflexes, and the power to fly at high speeds. The armor also grants her a glowing red lasso that appears similar to barbed wire. The lasso is infinite in length, is virtually indestructible, and can drain the life force out of those wrapped in its confines. Cassie's armor also appears to have a mind of its own and has taken over her mind and body on a few occasions. It was later revealed that Cassie has divine heritage as well, as her father was revealed to be Wonder Woman's elder brother Lennox.<ref>''Teen Titans'' #65''</ref>\n\n==Other versions==\n* Cassie played a central role in issue #54 of the ''[[Teen Titans Go!]]'' comic. She was the head of her high school's Wonder Woman fan club and had repeatedly tried to get the superhero to visit her school. Her obsession led her to steal two mystical artifacts that granted her superpowers, after which she barged into an athletic tournament on [[Themyscira (DC Comics)|Paradise Island]]. This event was set up by [[Donna Troy]] to see which of the world's young female heroes might be able to replace her as Wonder Woman's partner. Cassie initially planned to defeat Donna one-on-one, but wound up saving her from an invasion by the undersea villain Trident instead. At the issue's end, Donna offered Cassie a chance to join the Titans' worldwide training program, once her mother was through punishing her for stealing the artifacts. She made a brief appearance in issue #55, sucker-punching Cyborg in his dreams.\n* Cassie also has a recurring role on the ''[[Tiny Titans]]'' comic by Art Baltazar and Franco Aureliani. In the first issue, she is ridiculed by her cousin [[Donna Troy]], [[Dick Grayson]], [[Cyborg (comics)]], and [[Kid Flash]] for wearing a [[T-shirt]] and jeans instead of a skirt with stars. However, when she returns, wearing a skirt with stars and a helmet, she finds the boys all wearing T-shirts and jeans. Her response to this is, \"What? I did it first, y'know!\"<ref>\"Tiny Titans\" #1</ref>\n* In the comic tie-in to ''[[Injustice: Gods Among Us]]'', Cassie is with the Titans when the Joker's nuclear bomb goes off. Her attire is similar to that of Wonder Woman's in the game. She is sent to spy on Conner after he is devastated by Superman's actions to see what he's up to, and finds him at the Fortress of Solitude trying to find the Phantom Zone Projector. She and the other Titans try to help Conner stop Superman, but Superman mortally wounds him. She and the Titans are sent to the Phantom Zone by Superman to save Conner's life and to stop them from interfering with Superman's plans. In the prequel to ''Injustice 2'', they are freed from the Phantom Zone thanks to the Insurgency. As evidenced during their fight with Amazo, her relationship to her mentor, Wonder Woman, is strained due to the latter allying with the Regime (though Diana is still concerned for Cassie's well-being and had no idea about Superman sending the Titans to the Phantom Zone).\n\n==In other media==\n\n===Television===\n* In the episode \"Paradise Lost\" from the first season of the ''[[Justice League (TV series)|Justice League]]'' animated series, Wonder Woman saves a young blonde girl from a tree. When Wonder Woman returns the girl to her mother, the mother calls the girl \"Cassie\". This is an obvious reference to Wonder Girl from the comics.\n* Wonder Girl appears in the ''[[Young Justice (TV series)|Young Justice: Invasion]]'' episode \"Happy New Year\", voiced by [[Mae Whitman]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ksitetv.com/young-justice/young-justice-interview-greg-weisman-brandon-vietti-talk-saturdays-season-premiere/13884|title=Young Justice Interview: Greg Weisman & Brandon Vietti Talk Saturday's Season Premiere - KSiteTV|accessdate=13 October 2014}}</ref> She is introduced as a member of [[Young Justice|the Team]]'s Beta Squad alongside [[Barbara Gordon|Batgirl]] where they first appear to fight [[Lobo (DC Comics)|Lobo]] who was targeting U.N. Secretary General Tseng (who was actually an alien in disguise). In \"Alienated\" Wonder Girl and Wonder Woman were part of Delta Squad during the mission to stop the Kroloteans on Malina Island. They both took out multiple Mechs. When they learned the base was set to explode, she and the team retreated to the Bio-Ship. In \"Beneath\" she, [[Miss Martian]], [[Bumblebee (comics)|Bumblebee]], and Batgirl liberated a group of abductees guarded by [[Mammoth (comics)|Mammoth]], [[Icicle (comics)|Icicle Jr.]], Devastation, [[Shimmer (comics)|Shimmer]], and [[Psimon]] in Bialya. In \"Before the Dawn\", Wonder Girl and Alpha Squad followed a Manta-Flyer from Star City to the Reach's headquarters to rescue their captured teammates and other abductees. The operation was cut short by a Reach enforcer, who Wonder Girl dubbed as \"[[Black Beetle (DC Comics)|Black Beetle]]\". As he overpowered and easily defeated the team one by one, Cassie contacted the other heroes for help. Black Beetle pinned her against the door, and mercilessly slammed her into it repeatedly until she was down. Blue Beetle, [[Beast Boy]] and [[Bart Allen|Impulse]] arrived. While Blue Beetle held off the Black Beetle, Impulse and Beast Boy helped the team aboard the Bio-Ship and escaped. Wonder Girl and [[Tim Drake]] became a couple shortly after the Reach invasion concluded. Wally West's death was the catalyst in giving Wonder Girl the courage to kiss him. In ''[[Young Justice: Outsiders]]'', she tries patch things up with Tim Drake after he leaves the Team and becomes a member of the Batman Inc. Later in the season, she helps found the Outsiders (alongside Beast Boy, Blue Beetle, Static, Geo-Force, and Bart Allen).\n\n===Film===\n* Cassie Sandsmark makes a cameo appearance in the DC animated movie, ''[[Justice League: Throne of Atlantis]]''. She is shown eating dinner behind the table of [[Superman]] and Wonder Woman. When [[Cyborg (comics)|Cyborg]] and [[Captain Marvel (DC Comics)|Shazam]] come to fetch them via boom tube, Cassie stands up and exclaims, \"I love you, Shazam!\" She is apparently wearing a Shazam T-shirt.\n* The ''Young Justice'' version of Cassie Sandsmark, along with [[Tigress (DC Comics)#Artemis Crock|Artemis]], [[Zatanna]], and [[Miss Martian]], makes a cameo appearance as home viewers in ''[[Scooby-Doo!

She was created by [[John Byrne (comics)|John Byrne]] and first appeared in ''[[Wonder Woman]]'' (vol. 2) #105 (January 1996). The second Wonder Girl, Cassie is a sidekick of [[Wonder Woman]] and has been featured as a member of the [[Teen Titans]].\n\nWhen Cassie was introduced, she was the daughter of an archaeologist, Dr. [[Helena Sandsmark]], a friend of Wonder Woman's. To help Wonder Woman during an adventure, she borrowed magical artifacts which bestowed upon Cassie superpowers, with which she fought crime as Wonder Girl. Later, [[Zeus (DC Comics)|Zeus]], king of the Greek gods, grants her real powers. Later revelations showed that Cassie was in fact a [[demigod]]dess and the natural daughter of Zeus and Dr. Helena.<ref name=\"ww105\">''Wonder Woman'' (vol. 2) #105 (1996)</ref>\n\nIn 2011, DC relaunched its books with a new continuity called [[The New 52]], and one of its major continuity changes was to Wonder Woman, establishing that she is a demigod and the daughter of Zeus. Cassie is reintroduced in the pages of ''Teen Titans'' as a superpowered thief with enchanted demonic bracelets; she is recruited into the Teen Titans superhero group by [[Tim Drake|Red Robin]], the former prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of the superhero [[Batman]], and has no obvious connection to Wonder Woman. Later, she learns that she is Wonder Woman's niece and Zeus's granddaughter. Her father is revealed as being a British super-soldier named Lennox Sandsmark who is Wonder Woman's half-brother and himself a son of Zeus. As before, Helen, Cassie's mother, is an archaeologist.<ref>''Teen Titans'' Vol 4 #19 (June 2013).

Cassandra later had the opportunity to ask Zeus for a boon,<ref name=\"ww122-123\">''Wonder Woman'' (vol. 2) #122-123 (1997)</ref> and requested real superpowers. Zeus granted her request, but gave Dr. Sandsmark the ability to deactivate them with the simple touch of her hand upon Cassie. Dr. Sandsmark, however, reluctantly accepted her daughter's wish to be a superhero and rarely if ever uses this ability.\n\n===Young Justice===\n{{see also|Young Justice}}\nCassie heavily idolized [[Donna Troy]], the original [[Wonder Girl]], and to that effect wore a black wig over her natural blonde hair (it also helped to conceal her identity). Donna gave Cassie the second costume she wore as Wonder Girl, but Cassie was afraid to wear it lest it were ruined.

She is also referred to as \"Ares' champion\", and is in a relationship with [[Superboy (Kon-El)|Conner Kent]] ([[Superboy (Kon-El)|Superboy]]). It is not revealed whether they are married or merely dating.\n\nIt was also during her Titans membership that she was revealed to be Zeus' daughter, a fact both Zeus and her mother kept from her for most of her life. Cassie was originally told by her mother that her biological father had died. Wonder Woman knew about Cassie's link to Zeus but chose to hide this from Cassie as well at the request of Cassie's mother.

Cassie, feeling abandoned by her best friends, leaves the Titans during the year in which ''[[52 (comics)|52]]'' takes place, following Robin's departure. Cassie becomes involved in a [[cult]] heavily influenced by [[Krypton (comics)|Kryptonian]] culture. She sets up an altar in [[Titans Tower]] with Kryptonian crystals and a gold figure with the Superman-insignia, which means \"hope\" in Kryptonian. Soon, [[Elongated Man|Ralph Dibny]] approaches her because someone defaced the grave of his wife [[Sue Dibny|Sue]] with an upside down 'S' Shield, which in Kryptonian means \"resurrection\".\n\nAbout five days later, Cassie and her fellow cult members meet with Ralph. Cassie mentions that it was another member, [[Dev-Em]], who led her to join. Cassie explains that the goal of the cult is to resurrect Superboy. As a test of their process, they intend to resurrect [[Sue Dibny]]. Cassie and Ralph attend a ceremony designed to resurrect Sue, but Ralph grows suspicious and with the help of other superheroes, disrupts the ceremony, destroying the Kryptonite which was essential to the process. Cassie leaves with Dev-Em, blaming Ralph for destroying her chances to resurrect Superboy. After stopping [[Weather Wizard]] in Metropolis, Cassie meets [[Booster Gold#52 and Supernova|Supernova]] and refers to him incorrectly as Kon-El, who actually turns out to be Booster Gold in disguise.\n\n===One Year Later===\n{{main|One Year Later}}\nDuring \"One Year Later\", Wonder Girl is seen attempting to stop [[Gemini (DC Comics)|Gemini]] of the [[Brotherhood of Evil]] from escaping [[S.T.A.R. Labs]] with valuable technology, revealing that she had been following the Brotherhood for some time. She also sports a new costume influenced by that of the late Superboy. She now wears a [[Golden Age of Comic Books|Golden Age]] Wonder Woman-themed [[t-shirt]] and [[denim]] [[jeans]].<ref name=\"tt34\">''Teen Titans'' (vol. 3) #34 (2006)</ref>\n\nShe temporarily rejoins the team,<ref name=\"tt35\">''Teen Titans'' (vol. 3) #35 (2006)</ref> under the suggestion of [[Cyborg (comics)|Cyborg]] so that they may combine forces to defeat the [[Brotherhood of Evil]]. After the Teen Titans and [[Doom Patrol]] defeat the Brotherhood of Evil, she decides to rejoin the team permanently. When she goes to tell Robin of her decision, she discovers his secretive and unsuccessful attempts to bring back Superboy. Though obsessed with having Conner back, Cassie reacts in horror and in an attempt to quell Robin's anger at Cassie, the two kiss. For a while the two refused to talk about the incident beyond coming to the agreement that it was a mistake, but they both have discussed it with others.<ref name=\"ww4\">''Wonder Woman'' (vol. 4) #4 (2007)</ref><ref name=\"sg11\">''Supergirl'' (vol. 5) #11 (2007)</ref><ref name=\"sg12\">''Supergirl'' (vol. 5) #12 (2007)</ref> With her life in disarray, Cassie has been having difficulty with her personal life, often having major confrontations with her mother.

She was also not pleased that Robin was aware of Diana's whereabouts during the year after Infinite Crisis and did not inform her about it. Diana and Cassie have not been able to discuss their past differences, leading to Cassie to turn to Supergirl and the now resurrected [[Donna Troy]] instead for emotional support dealing with Conner's death.\n\nFollowing the resurrection of [[Jericho (comics)|Jericho]] at the hands of Raven, Wonder Girl and Robin request that Raven use the same ceremony to resurrect Superboy. Raven calmly explains that is not possible, because Jericho's resurrection was a special case: Jericho's soul was still on Earth, imprisoned inside of a computer disk, while Conner's has moved on to the afterlife. In the middle of this conversation with [[Robin (Tim Drake)|Robin]] and [[Raven (DC Comics)|Raven]], Wonder Girl is captured by [[Deathstroke]]'s villainous [[Titans East]] after an attack by [[Inertia (DC Comics)|Inertia]] and [[Match (DC Comics)|Match]]. Each member of Titans East has been recruited to negate a specific Titan. Deathstroke selected Match, a Bizarro-type clone of Superboy, to counter Wonder Girl due to his strength and his warped visage as being a psychological edge against her.<ref name=\"tt43\">''Teen Titans'' (vol. 3) #43 (2007)</ref>\n\nThe Titans battle furiously against the Titans East, during which they are able to convince [[Cassandra Cain|Batgirl]] and [[Duela Dent]] to switch sides. Unfortunately the team is defeated by Slade's team a second time. However, Raven, Cyborg, and Duela Dent manage to get aid from [[Dick Grayson|Nightwing]], Donna Troy, [[Beast Boy]], and Flash (Bart Allen). Together the Titans defeat Slade, who along with Inertia, manages to escape. During the fight Jericho possess Match, and the team is reluctant to release Match due to the danger he poses.\n\nIn the ''[[Countdown to Final Crisis|Countdown]]'' limited series, Cassie attends [[Bart Allen]]'s funeral and during a heated and controversial eulogy, she vows to get revenge for Bart's death.\n\nCassie then becomes involved in the [[Amazons Attack!|Amazon's attack on Washington D.C.]] Supergirl and Wonder Girl discover that their friends and family have been placed in an internment camp due to their ties to the Amazons. After a failed attempt to aid them, the two heroes agree to bring the U.S. President to [[Hippolyta (DC Comics)|Queen Hippolyta]] in order to stop the war. They are ambushed by a group of Amazons in the process, which causes the President to become mortally wounded. The actions of the Amazons and Wonder Girl's own involvement cause public outcry against all those who have followed in Wonder Woman's footsteps. Ultimately Cassie declares that despite her training and past that she is not an Amazon, preferring her ties to the Teen Titans over that of the Amazons.<ref>''Teen Titans'' (vol. 3) #49</ref> Accepting her decision, [[Artemis of Bana-Mighdall|Artemis]] wishes her well and leaves Cassie to her devices. Wonder Girl celebrates by sharing another kiss with Robin in front of her teammates.\n\nIn the months following the kiss, Cassie and Tim continue to go through 'will-they-won't-they' moments in which they both continue to question the validity of their relationship.{{Issue|date=October 2008}} Then following a battle against an army of future Titans, the pair decided at last to date. Unfortunately, their relationship is short-lived, as after their first official date Cassie ends the relationship, because she feels she is using Tim.<ref name=\"tt55\">''Teen Titans'' (vol. 3) #55 (2008)</ref> This has resulted in a growing animosity between the pair, which has begun to bleed into their relationships with the other Titans.{{Issue|date=October 2008}}\n\n====''Huntress''====\n[[Image:ArmoredCassie.jpg|thumb|right|Cassie in her Amazon armor.<br>Art by [[Aaron Lopresti]].]]Wonder Girl recently appeared in a six-issue self-titled mini-series written by [[J. Torres]] and with art and covers by Sanford Greene and [[Nathan Massengill]]. In this series, Wonder Girl attempts to make up for the mistakes made by the Amazons on her own. Cassie adopts a secret identity, taking up the name \"Drusilla\" (the same name used by Wonder Girl in the '70s [[Wonder Woman (TV series)|''Wonder Woman'' television series]]). However, as she attempts to apprehend a group of mystical beasts left over from the Amazons' attack, she finds herself confronted by her half-brother [[Hercules (DC Comics)|Hercules]], who claims to want to help her become a true champion of the gods and to rebuild Olympus. Cassie is reluctant to trust him. Hercules persists and chases after Cassie, taking the form of Superboy in order to get her attention.\n\nTogether, Hercules and Cassie try to discover who is attacking the remaining Olympian gods. Soon into their search they are attacked by the [[Female Furies]]. Hercules stops the fight by explaining that he has allied with the Furies in hopes of rescuing the gods, or, failing that, starting a new pantheon with them. The Furies have their own plans and are only using Hercules to get to Wonder Girl. The Furies soon betray Hercules, with [[Bloody Mary (DC Comics)|Bloody Mary]] using her bite to gain power over Hercules, forcing him to do what the Furies want. The Furies then kidnap Cassie's mother to lure her into a trap. Aided by the [[Olympian (comics)|Olympian]], Wonder Girl goes into battle, being forced to fight her own brother. The Teen Titans, Empress, Arrowette and Wonder Woman show up to help. After Bloody Mary is murdered by the [[New Gods|New Gods killer]], Hercules is freed from her spell and immediately saves Wonder Girl from being kidnapped by the Furies. Hercules goes free after he reveals he is now a demi-god and that Zeus released him to help stop \"[[Countdown to Final Crisis|the Great Disaster]]\". Hercules then leaves to perform certain \"labors\".\n\nThe series ends with Cassie reconciling with Wonder Woman, who tells Cassie that she has become her own woman.\n\nCassie is later attacked by her nephew [[Lycus (DC Comics)|Lycus]], the son of Ares. He attempts to take her title as Ares' avatar, along with her power. Although he is successful in stealing Cassie's powers derived from Ares, Cassie discovers that she no longer needs to be blessed with powers from the gods as she willed her own innate power to surface. Cassie now possesses a high level of super-strength all her own.\n\nRobin ultimately makes the decision to leave the Teen Titans for an undetermined length of time in the aftermath of [[Batman R.I.P]], leaving Cassie with the task of assembling and leading a new team. After an unsuccessful attempt at having Kid Devil recruit teen metahumans such as [[Klarion]], [[Shining Knight]], and the teen members of the [[Justice Society of America]], Cassie eventually gains three new Titans in [[Static (DC Comics)|Static]], [[Aquagirl (Lorena Marquez)|Aquagirl]], and [[Kid Eternity]]. Kid Eternity's ability to summon the spirits of the deceased briefly tempts Cassie, who considers having him summon Conner's spirit. However, she eventually decides against it, telling Eternity never to grant her such a request, even if she were to beg him.<ref>''Teen Titans'' #71</ref>\n\nSome months later, between the [[Final Crisis]] and the [[Blackest Night]], Cassie becomes aware of Conner's rebirth by [[Final Crisis: Legion of 3 Worlds|Brainiac 5's hand]]. Despite meeting him briefly at his return,<ref>''Final Crisis: Legion of 3 Worlds'' #5 (2009)</ref> Cassie decides to wait, until [[Ma and Pa Kent|Martha Kent]] herself, now sheltering Conner at her place, invites Cassie for dinner, essentially granting Cassie and Conner a date. At first skeptical and fearing to ''end as [[Lana Lang]]'', basically forgotten and replaced as Conner relocated to Smallville and gained a new circle of friends, she's touched by Conner opening his heart to her about her fears and dreams for their future life, and thus decides to tell Conner about herself and Tim Drake. Conner quickly forgives her, arguing that even if Cassie still loves him, she could not have known of his impending resurrection in the immediate aftermath of the Infinite Crisis, so she has nothing to blame. Happily, Cassie accepts to rekindle their relationship.<ref name=\"Adv2\">''Adventure Comics'' (vol. 2) #2 (September 2009)</ref>\n\nDue to personal responsibilities, neither Conner nor Bart return to the Teen Titans, though Wonder Girl still continues to lead. However, following the demise of [[Kid Devil]], Cassie begins questioning her leadership and begins to make mistakes. During a massive battle with [[Cinderblock (comics)|Cinderblock]] in downtown San Francisco, Wonder Girl refuses to let her team attack the villain directly, causing massive destruction to the area. The heroes continue in their fruitless stalemate until Beast Boy arrives and takes command of the team, leading to their victory. In the aftermath of the battle, Beast Boy tells Cassie that she has to stop dwelling on Devil's death or else more innocent people are going to get hurt, something she does not take kindly.<ref>''Titans'' (vol. 2) #17 (August 2009)</ref>\n\nA few days later, Beast Boy makes the decision to move back into Titans Tower and replace Cassie as the head of the team, declaring that they need a more experienced leader to get back on track. Though Cassie initially says nothing about this, she ultimately becomes angry and tells Beast Boy that no one asked for his help, and that she can lead the team just fine. Beast Boy simply replies by saying that the Teen Titans need help, and that everyone, including Cyborg, think so.<ref>''Teen Titans'' (vol. 3) #75-76 (September\u2013October 2009)</ref>\n\n===Blackest Night===\nDuring the events of ''[[Blackest Night]]'', Cassie joins Kid Flash and Beast Boy as part of a small group of past and present Titans who assemble at Titans Tower. Lacking assistance from Static, Miss Martian, Blue Beetle, [[Bombshell (DC Comics)|Bombshell]], and Aquagirl (each of whom are presumably defending other cities), the team barely survives the onslaught.<ref>''Blackest Night: Titans'' #1-3</ref>\n\nAfter [[Dawn Granger]] uses her abilities to destroy the Black Lanterns, Cassie and the others travel to [[Coast City]] in order to assist [[Flash (Barry Allen)|Barry Allen]] and [[Hal Jordan]] in their battle with [[Nekron]], the leader of the Black Lantern Corps. To the horror of the gathered heroes, Nekron uses his abilities to transform several once-dead heroes into Black Lanterns, including Superboy, Kid Flash, Donna, and Wonder Woman.<ref>''Blackest Night'' #5 (November 2009)</ref> In the ensuing battle, Cassie is killed when Donna Troy violently tears her heart out. However, it is then revealed that the entire battle was an imagination of Wonder Woman, and Cassie is shown to still be alive.<ref>''Blackest Night: Wonder Woman'' #2 (January 2010)</ref> When Black Lantern Conner attacks Cassie, all the while attempting to break free from the Black Ring's control, Conner manages to break the control in temporary, short lapses, which he uses to alert Cassie about the solution to his Black Ring problem. The battle moves to the fortress, where Cassie realizes what Conner was referring to when he told them to move to the [[Fortress of Solitude]] Conner's corpse, placed where he awaits his resurrection in ''[[Final Crisis: Legion of 3 Worlds|Legion of Three Worlds]]''. The Black Ring, confused, leaves the living Conner and tries to attach itself to his corpse, but Conner awakens his freeze breath ability, which freezes the ring, and Cassie throws it into orbit. After reconciling, the pair heads back to Coast City for the final battle with Nekron's army.<ref>''Adventure Comics'' (vol. 2) #7 (February 2010)</ref>\n\n===Return of Conner===\nAfter this, Cassie travels to New York to confront Cyborg about Beast Boy's statements. He assures her that she is capable of leading the Titans, and she returns to the team and admits to them that she is done moping over Conner and Eddie. She then leads the team to the city of Dakota in order to rescue Static, who had been kidnapped by a superhuman gangster named [[Holocaust (DC Comics)|Holocaust]].<ref>''Teen Titans'' (vol. 3) #79 (January 2010)</ref> After hearing about a battle between Static and Holocaust in downtown Dakota, Cassie arrives on the scene with Bombshell and Aquagirl. The three heroines are easily defeated and captured by Holocaust, who then informs them that he plans on killing them and weaponizing their powers in order to sell. Beast Boy and the other Titans arrive at the compound to retrieve their comrades, but end up being overpowered and defeated themselves. At the last second, Cyborg bursts into the compound with Superboy and Kid Flash, preparing to rescue the other Titans.<ref>''Teen Titans'' #80-81</ref> Cassie is soon freed, and assists Superboy in holding off Holocaust while the other Titans make their escape. In the final battle, Cassie uses her lasso to bind the villain, allowing Kid Flash to finish him off by sending him plummeting into the Earth's inner core (though thanks to his superhuman durability, Static remarks that the core would not kill him). On the plane ride back to San Francisco, Conner remarks that Cassie seems to be ignoring him, and she simply responds by telling him that he is correct.<ref>''Teen Titans'' #82</ref>\n\nCassie later travels to Gotham City alongside several of her fellow Titans after [[Ra's al Ghul]] begins targeting people close to Tim Drake. She attempts to rescue [[Barbara Gordon]] from members of the [[League of Assassins]], but arrives to find that she has already defeated the men that attempted to kill her.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://dcu.blog.dccomics.com/files/2010/04/rrob_12_dylux-5-copy.jpg |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-04-30 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111026180144/http://dcu.blog.dccomics.com/files/2010/04/rrob_12_dylux-5-copy.jpg |archivedate=2011-10-26}}</ref>\n\nDuring the events of ''[[Brightest Day]]'', Cassie confronts a recently resurrected Titan by the name of [[Osiris (DC Comics)#Amon Tomaz|Osiris]] when he arrives at Titans Tower, looking for help from his former teammates. Cassie tries to convince Osiris to turn himself over to the police for the murdering the [[Persuader (comics)|Persuader]] during ''52'', but he angrily brushes her off and flees before Cassie can contact the authorities. [[Blue Beetle (Jaime Reyes)|Blue Beetle]] asks if the Titans should go after him, but Cassie simply replies by saying that Osiris will return, and then rhetorically asks, \"[[Teen Titans#Brightest Day: Titans- Villains for Hire|where else can he go?]]\"<ref>''Titans'' (vol. 2) #24</ref>\n\nAfter a disastrous mission to another dimension in order to rescue Raven, the Titans are torn asunder. Miss Martian is rendered comatose, Static is left temporarily depowered, and Aquagirl and Bombshell are missing and presumed dead at sea. Despite her pleas for Static to stay, Wonder Girl is ultimately left with a roster consisting of only herself, Superboy, Kid Flash, Raven, and Beast Boy.<ref>''Teen Titans'' (vol. 3) #87</ref> A short time after this, the Titans rescue Bombshell and Aquagirl, who are both removed from the team by Wonder Girl. When asked about this decision (as well as the subsequent choice to invite the unstable [[Rose Wilson]] back into the team), Wonder Girl states that Kid Devil's death has forced her to realize that inexperienced teen heroes have no place on the team. At the same time, she admits to Conner that she is having trouble reconciling her knowledge as a leader with her fear of losing him again.<ref>''Teen Titans'' (vol. 3) #88</ref>\n\n===One-shot===\n{{update|date=February 2012}}\nIn January 2011, Wonder Girl was given a one-shot, which was written by [[JT Krul]], drawn by [[Adriana Melo]], and covered by [[Nicola Scott]].,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=28948|title=DC Comics Solicitations for January, 2011|accessdate=13 October 2014}}</ref>\n\n===The New 52===\n{{update|date=August 2017}}\nIn September 2011, [[The New 52]] rebooted DC's continuity. In this new timeline, Cassie Sandsmark is reintroduced in the ''[[Teen Titans]]'' series. This version of Cassie, who dislikes being called \"Wonder Girl\", started out as a teenage thief, who started at the age of sixteen and lost touch with her mother, who stole a pair of enchanted bracelets from a temple before meeting [[Tim Drake|Red Robin]]. Living in Hollywood surviving on a crime spree and bought a little house with the money she made. She first crossed paths with Red Robin after she was rescued from an organization called N.O.W.H.E.R.E, who were capturing young teenagers who were developing [[Metahuman| Metahuman]] abilities for their own nefarious purposes. She caught the organization's attention when her exploits were attaching attention her from the media which they dubbed her \"Wonder Girl\". She stole a car but was later pulled by a police officer in the Pacific Coast Highway, the latter was revealed to be an agent of N.O.W.H.E.R.E. and tried to capture her but Red Robin intervened. Red Robin was tracking down N.O.W.H.E.R.E and news coverage of teenagers with abilities and their action such as in New Mexico, a Mexican teenager boy who can make energy constructs and is calling himself [[Bunker|Bunker(comics)]] is arrested by state police only to later escape custody, in Westchester, New York, [[Kid Flash|Bart Allen]] had interrupted a news coverage of a fire in an abandoned mansion to announce himself to the world. The fire department had the blaze under control but then overhears one of the fire marshals being trapped on the roof so he rushes into the flames to save him but in his haste he forgets about backdraft and opening the door to the balcony and causes a massive explosion of fire. Kid Flash, knocked unconscious, is held responsible for bringing the blaze to an uncontrollable peak, News reports of a \"[[Beast Boy|Beast Boy]]\" who could shape shift into any animal, and many others such as reports of a missing [[ teenage girl from India who could manipulate light |Solstice (comics)]], A teen hero calling himself [[Static]]{{dn|date=April 2020}} is seen in NYC, a boy posted pictures of a sexy orange girl with fiery hair ([[Starfire (Teen Titans)|Starfire]]) in a purple bikini he spotted in [[Martinique|Martinique]] on his online social media account, and photos a \"[[Martian Girl]]\" in a lecture by Lex Luther about aliens on earth.<ref>''Teen Titans'' (vol. 4) #2</ref> She is later revealed to be the daughter of Helen, an archaeologist who reputation was destroyed when Cassie stole the bracelets which resulted in the death of one of Helen's colleagues, who was Cassandra's one time love interest and mentor in stealing, and Lennox Sandsmark, a British super-soldier, who left the family when Cassie was only four years old.<ref>''Teen Titans'' Vol 4 #13 (December 2012)</ref> As Lennox is a demigod son of Zeus, and also a half-brother of Wonder Woman, Cassie, for the first time, is related to Wonder Woman.<ref>''Teen Titans'' Vol 4 #19 (June 2013)</ref>\n\n===Rebirth===\nIn the Super Sons of Tomorrow crossover, the version of Cassie Sandmark from the Titans Tomorrow future briefly arrived in the present timeline of Rebirth alongside other members of the Titans of Tomorrow.\n\nIn [[Young Justice]] #2, Zeus refers to Cassie as \"the future of the pantheon of the gods\". As part of her birthright, Zeus offers her a necklace that is said to contain immense powers. However, Cassie decides to hold off on taking this gift until she does something to truly earn it. Zeus calls her a \"giant pain, just like her mother\".\n\n==Powers and abilities==\nCassandra originally received her powers from a number of mystical artifacts employed by [[Artemis of Bana-Mighdall|Artemis]] during her time as Wonder Woman. These included the Gauntlet of [[Atlas (mythology)|Atlas]] and the Sandals of [[Hermes]], which provided her with the powers of strength and speed/flight, respectively.<ref name=\"ww111\"/> She was eventually granted similar abilities by [[Zeus]] as \"her fondest wish\".<ref name=\"ww122-123\" /> Discouraged by previously shown arrogance in his children ([[Ares (DC Comics)|Ares]] and [[Hercules (DC Comics)|Heracles]]), Zeus also blessed Cassandra's mother with the ability to take away her powers for a short time via a simple touch.<ref name=\"ww122-123\"/>\n\nShortly after joining the Teen Titans, Ares approached her and gave Cassandra her own magic lasso.<ref name=\"tt2\"/> Unlike Wonder Woman's [[Lasso of Truth]], Cassandra's is a weapon which channels Zeus' lightning when she becomes angry.<ref name=\"tt6\"/> When the Greek gods left the mortal plane as a result of the events of ''Infinite Crisis'', taking Cassandra's powers along with them, Ares offered her some of his power, saying that she would be \"more powerful than [she's] ever been\". What this entails is not made entirely clear, though she appeared to have retained all of her former abilities.<ref name=\"ic6\"/><ref name=\"tt34\"/> In a storyline taking place \"[[One Year Later]]\", Cassie was shown catching a falling [[Jet aircraft|jet]], which she was surprised at being able to accomplish.<ref name=\"tt40\">''Teen Titans'' (vol. 3) #40 (2006)</ref> However, while trying to stop the military from detaining her mother, Ares causes her powers to fluctuate when he believes she is wasting them on frivolous matters.{{Issue|date=October 2008}}\n\nIn the end, Ares was not pleased with Cassandra as his champion. He returned another to take her place. During a battle with Ares' son, King Lycus, who also drew power from him, Cassie was able to cast away her connection to the war god, and tap into her own powers as a demi-god (like her brother Heracles). Her real powers increased to an even greater level of strength than before. Currently, having tapped into her own demi-goddess powers, Cassie is an Olympian powerhouse. Although, she is not as powerful as Wonder Woman or Donna Troy, Cassie is still a  powerful young woman. Her lasso has apparently also changed, enabling her to turn Lycus to dust with a simple order.\n\nCassie was trained by the Amazon Artemis and is extremely well trained in the use of various weapons and in various martial arts. She is also a very capable leader and strategist.\n\nAfter the New 52 reboot, Cassie's powers have changed yet again. Her powers are now derived from the \"Silent Armor\" that she wears, which was forged in the heart of a sun and is apparently related to the demon known as Trigon. The armor is invisible unless she summons it or is in a combat situation, but she is always able to use its powers. The armor usually appears as a glittering red bodysuit, golden gauntlets and, occasionally, a hood. The armor grants her powers similar to those of her pre-reboot counterpart such as superhuman strength (sufficient enough for her to fight against Superboy for a short time), durability (though she is still vulnerable to piercing weapons), superhuman reflexes, and the power to fly at high speeds. The armor also grants her a glowing red lasso that appears similar to barbed wire. The lasso is infinite in length, is virtually indestructible, and can drain the life force out of those wrapped in its confines. Cassie's armor also appears to have a mind of its own and has taken over her mind and body on a few occasions. It was later revealed that Cassie has divine heritage as well, as her father was revealed to be Wonder Woman's elder brother Lennox.<ref>''Teen Titans'' #65''</ref>\n\n==Other versions==\n* Cassie played a central role in issue #54 of the ''[[Teen Titans Go!]]'' comic. She was the head of her high school's Wonder Woman fan club and had repeatedly tried to get the superhero to visit her school. Her obsession led her to steal two mystical artifacts that granted her superpowers, after which she barged into an athletic tournament on [[Themyscira (DC Comics)|Paradise Island]]. This event was set up by [[Donna Troy]] to see which of the world's young female heroes might be able to replace her as Wonder Woman's partner. Cassie initially planned to defeat Donna one-on-one, but wound up saving her from an invasion by the undersea villain Trident instead. At the issue's end, Donna offered Cassie a chance to join the Titans' worldwide training program, once her mother was through punishing her for stealing the artifacts. She made a brief appearance in issue #55, sucker-punching Cyborg in his dreams.\n* Cassie also has a recurring role on the ''[[Tiny Titans]]'' comic by Art Baltazar and Franco Aureliani. In the first issue, she is ridiculed by her cousin [[Donna Troy]], [[Dick Grayson]], [[Cyborg (comics)]], and [[Kid Flash]] for wearing a [[T-shirt]] and jeans instead of a skirt with stars. However, when she returns, wearing a skirt with stars and a helmet, she finds the boys all wearing T-shirts and jeans. Her response to this is, \"What? I did it first, y'know!\"<ref>\"Tiny Titans\" #1</ref>\n* In the comic tie-in to ''[[Injustice: Gods Among Us]]'', Cassie is with the Titans when the Joker's nuclear bomb goes off. Her attire is similar to that of Wonder Woman's in the game. She is sent to spy on Conner after he is devastated by Superman's actions to see what he's up to, and finds him at the Fortress of Solitude trying to find the Phantom Zone Projector. She and the other Titans try to help Conner stop Superman, but Superman mortally wounds him. She and the Titans are sent to the Phantom Zone by Superman to save Conner's life and to stop them from interfering with Superman's plans. In the prequel to ''Injustice 2'', they are freed from the Phantom Zone thanks to the Insurgency. As evidenced during their fight with Amazo, her relationship to her mentor, Wonder Woman, is strained due to the latter allying with the Regime (though Diana is still concerned for Cassie's well-being and had no idea about Superman sending the Titans to the Phantom Zone).\n\n==In other media==\n\n===Television===\n* In the episode \"Paradise Lost\" from the first season of the ''[[Justice League (TV series)|Justice League]]'' animated series, Wonder Woman saves a young blonde girl from a tree. When Wonder Woman returns the girl to her mother, the mother calls the girl \"Cassie\". This is an obvious reference to Wonder Girl from the comics.\n* Wonder Girl appears in the ''[[Young Justice (TV series)|Young Justice: Invasion]]'' episode \"Happy New Year\", voiced by [[Mae Whitman]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ksitetv.com/young-justice/young-justice-interview-greg-weisman-brandon-vietti-talk-saturdays-season-premiere/13884|title=Young Justice Interview: Greg Weisman & Brandon Vietti Talk Saturday's Season Premiere - KSiteTV|accessdate=13 October 2014}}</ref> She is introduced as a member of [[Young Justice|the Team]]'s Beta Squad alongside [[Barbara Gordon|Batgirl]] where they first appear to fight [[Lobo (DC Comics)|Lobo]] who was targeting U.N. Secretary General Tseng (who was actually an alien in disguise). In \"Alienated\" Wonder Girl and Wonder Woman were part of Delta Squad during the mission to stop the Kroloteans on Malina Island. They both took out multiple Mechs. When they learned the base was set to explode, she and the team retreated to the Bio-Ship. In \"Beneath\" she, [[Miss Martian]], [[Bumblebee (comics)|Bumblebee]], and Batgirl liberated a group of abductees guarded by [[Mammoth (comics)|Mammoth]], [[Icicle (comics)|Icicle Jr.]], Devastation, [[Shimmer (comics)|Shimmer]], and [[Psimon]] in Bialya. In \"Before the Dawn\", Wonder Girl and Alpha Squad followed a Manta-Flyer from Star City to the Reach's headquarters to rescue their captured teammates and other abductees. The operation was cut short by a Reach enforcer, who Wonder Girl dubbed as \"[[Black Beetle (DC Comics)|Black Beetle]]\". As he overpowered and easily defeated the team one by one, Cassie contacted the other heroes for help. Black Beetle pinned her against the door, and mercilessly slammed her into it repeatedly until she was down. Blue Beetle, [[Beast Boy]] and [[Bart Allen|Impulse]] arrived. While Blue Beetle held off the Black Beetle, Impulse and Beast Boy helped the team aboard the Bio-Ship and escaped. Wonder Girl and [[Tim Drake]] became a couple shortly after the Reach invasion concluded. Wally West's death was the catalyst in giving Wonder Girl the courage to kiss him. In ''[[Young Justice: Outsiders]]'', she tries patch things up with Tim Drake after he leaves the Team and becomes a member of the Batman Inc. Later in the season, she helps found the Outsiders (alongside Beast Boy, Blue Beetle, Static, Geo-Force, and Bart Allen).\n\n===Film===\n* Cassie Sandsmark makes a cameo appearance in the DC animated movie, ''[[Justice League: Throne of Atlantis]]''. She is shown eating dinner behind the table of [[Superman]] and Wonder Woman. When [[Cyborg (comics)|Cyborg]] and [[Captain Marvel (DC Comics)|Shazam]] come to fetch them via boom tube, Cassie stands up and exclaims, \"I love you, Shazam!\" She is apparently wearing a Shazam T-shirt.\n* The ''Young Justice'' version of Cassie Sandsmark, along with [[Tigress (DC Comics)#Artemis Crock|Artemis]], [[Zatanna]], and [[Miss Martian]], makes a cameo appearance as home viewers in ''[[Scooby-Doo!

It was envisioned by [[Satish Ranjan Das]], a [[Kolkata]] lawyer, who prevised a school modelled on the [[United Kingdom|British]] [[public school (United Kingdom)|public school]], but conscious of Indian ambitions and desires. Although he died in 1928, he is considered the founder of the school. The school's first [[Head teacher|headmaster]] was [[Arthur Foot|Arthur E. Foot]], an Englishman who had spent nine years as a science master at [[Eton College]], England.<ref>{{cite book|year=1979|chapter=FOOT, Arthur Edward|title=Who Was Who 1961\u20131970|location=London|publisher=A. & C.

He was the fourth British headmaster in Doon's history and a member of [[Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference]], [[UK]].\n\nThe school houses roughly 500 pupils aged 12 to 18, and admission is based on a competitive entrance examination, a group discussion and an interview with the headmaster. Every year in January and April, the school admits pupils aged 13 in Grade 7 (known as D-form) and aged 14 in Grade 8 (C-form) respectively. Boys take the [[IGCSE]] exam in Grade 10, and for the final two years can choose between [[Indian School Certificate]] or [[International Baccalaureate]] curriculum. Doon remains a boys-only school despite continued pressure from political leaders, including former [[President of India|President]] [[Pratibha Patil]], to become [[Mixed-sex education|coeducational]]. [[Old boy network|Old boys]] of the school are known as 'Doscos'. \n\nDoon has been consistently ranked the best all-boys residential school in [[India]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.dailypioneer.com/2019/state-editions/17-schools-from-u---khand-secure-top-10-positions-in-ewisr.html|title=17 schools from U\u2019khand secure Top 10 positions in EWISR|first=The|last=Pioneer|website=The Pioneer}}</ref> Although the school has often been cited as 'Eton of India' by media outlets such as the [[BBC]],<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p02c3zgq|title=BBC World Service - Witness, India's Eton|website=BBC}}</ref> ''[[The New York Times]]'',<ref>{{cite news|author=STEVEN R.

He was the fourth British headmaster in Doon's history and a member of [[Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference]], [[UK]].\n\nThe school houses roughly 500 pupils aged 12 to 18, and admission is based on a competitive entrance examination, a group discussion and an interview with the headmaster. Every year in January and April, the school admits pupils aged 13 in Grade 7 (known as D-form) and aged 14 in Grade 8 (C-form) respectively. Boys take the [[IGCSE]] exam in Grade 10, and for the final two years can choose between [[Indian School Certificate]] or [[International Baccalaureate]] curriculum. Doon remains a boys-only school despite continued pressure from political leaders, including former [[President of India|President]] [[Pratibha Patil]], to become [[Mixed-sex education|coeducational]]. [[Old boy network|Old boys]] of the school are known as 'Doscos'. \n\nDoon has been consistently ranked the best all-boys residential school in [[India]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.dailypioneer.com/2019/state-editions/17-schools-from-u---khand-secure-top-10-positions-in-ewisr.html|title=17 schools from U\u2019khand secure Top 10 positions in EWISR|first=The|last=Pioneer|website=The Pioneer}}</ref> Although the school has often been cited as 'Eton of India' by media outlets such as the [[BBC]],<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p02c3zgq|title=BBC World Service - Witness, India's Eton|website=BBC}}</ref> ''[[The New York Times]]'',<ref>{{cite news|author=STEVEN R.

In the first phase, it is needed to achieve workers' power through representation by a coalition led by the CPRF. Achieving this goal will help eliminate the devastation from the standpoint of the party, the consequences conducted in the past decade of reforms, in particular by the nationalization of property privatized in the 1990s. However, in this case small producers will remain and moreover will be organized to protect them from robbery by \"big business, bureaucrats, and mafia groups\". It is planned to reform the management of enterprises through the creation of [[Workers' council|councils]] at various levels. The party also plans to transform Russia into a [[Soviet republic (system of government)|Soviet republic]].{{citation needed | date = December 2017}} In the second stage, the role of councils and [[trade union]]s will increase even more. The economy will be made a gradual transition to a socialist form of [[economix|economic activity]], but a small private equity is still retained. Finally, the third phase is to build [[socialism]].\n\nIn recent years, the Communist Party has also shown tendency of moving towards [[Dengism]]. The First Secretary Gennady Zyuganov also expressed that they should learn from China's successful example and build Russian socialism. He also encouraged all party members to read \"Selective work of Deng Xiaoping\". He said during his visit to China in 2008: \"If we have been learning the successful experience from the Chinese earlier, the Soviet Union would not have dissolved\".<ref name=\"ce.cn\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ce.cn/culture/rw/wg/xw/200801/26/t20080126_14371297.shtml|title=\u4e45\u52a0\u8bfa\u592b:\u4fc4\u5171\u515a\u5458\u5e94\u597d\u597d\u5b66\u4e60\u300a\u9093\u5c0f\u5e73\u6587\u9009\u300b(\u56fe)_\u4e2d\u56fd\u7ecf\u6d4e\u7f51\u2014\u2014\u56fd\u5bb6\u7ecf\u6d4e\u95e8\u6237|work=ce.cn|access-date=2014-04-22|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923201701/http://www.ce.cn/culture/rw/wg/xw/200801/26/t20080126_14371297.shtml|archive-date=2015-09-23|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.sina.com.cn/c/2008-01-30/102214861843.shtml|title=\u4fc4\u5171\u4e3b\u5e2d\u8bbf\u534e\u81ea\u79f0\u53ea\u6c42\u516c\u5e73\u4e00\u6218|work=sina.com.cn}}</ref>\n\n=== Party program ===\nUnder the present conditions in the Russian Federation, the CPRF calls for the following proposals:<ref name=\"kprf.ru\"/>\n* Stop the extinction of the country, restore benefits for large families, reconstruct the network of public kindergartens and provide housing for young families.[[File:Moscow rally 1 May 2012 19.JPG|thumb|Communist protesters with the sign \"the order of dismissal of [[Vladimir Putin]] for the betrayal of the national interests\", Moscow, 1 May 2012]]\n* Nationalize natural resources in Russia and the strategic sectors of the economy; revenues in these industries are to be used in the interests of all citizens.\n* Return to Russia from foreign banks the state financial reserves and use them for economic and social development.\n* Break the system of total fraud in the elections.\n* Create a truly independent judiciary.\n* Carry out an immediate package of measures to combat poverty and introduce price controls on essential goods.\n* Not raise the retirement age.\n* Restore government responsibility for housing and utilities, establish fees for municipal services in an amount not more than 10% of family income, stop the eviction of people to the streets and expand public housing.\n* Increase funding for science and scientists to provide decent wages and all the necessary research.\n* Restore the highest standards of universal and free secondary and higher education that existed during the Soviet era.\n* Ensure the availability and quality of health care.\n* Vigorously develop high-tech manufacturing.\n* Ensure the food and environmental security of the country and support the large collective farms for the production and processing of agricultural products.\n* Prioritize [[domestic debt]] over [[foreign debt]] (to compensate for household deposits, burnt in the disastrous years of \"reform\").{{clarify|date=December 2015}}<!-- Which reform?

In the first phase, it is needed to achieve workers' power through representation by a coalition led by the CPRF. Achieving this goal will help eliminate the devastation from the standpoint of the party, the consequences conducted in the past decade of reforms, in particular by the nationalization of property privatized in the 1990s. However, in this case small producers will remain and moreover will be organized to protect them from robbery by \"big business, bureaucrats, and mafia groups\". It is planned to reform the management of enterprises through the creation of [[Workers' council|councils]] at various levels. The party also plans to transform Russia into a [[Soviet republic (system of government)|Soviet republic]].{{citation needed | date = December 2017}} In the second stage, the role of councils and [[trade union]]s will increase even more. The economy will be made a gradual transition to a socialist form of [[economix|economic activity]], but a small private equity is still retained. Finally, the third phase is to build [[socialism]].\n\nIn recent years, the Communist Party has also shown tendency of moving towards [[Dengism]]. The First Secretary Gennady Zyuganov also expressed that they should learn from China's successful example and build Russian socialism. He also encouraged all party members to read \"Selective work of Deng Xiaoping\".

But the 1908 bankruptcy forced the DT&I to divest its acquisition.\n\nIn 1963, the DT&I, by then a subsidiary of the [[Pennsylvania Railroad]], once again gained control of the AA. The Ann Arbor lines became part of [[Conrail]] in April 1976, and were facing abandonment. In October 1977, they were purchased by the state of Michigan, which intended to preserve rail service over its tracks. In 1977 Michigan Interstate was designated operator of the entire line from Toledo to Frankfurt. A series of disputes arose during the early 1980's and multiple railroads were designated by the tracks owners, the State of Michigan, to operate the line. The line from Toledo to just south of Osmer (a passing siding north of Ann Arbor) was sold to the trustee for the estate purchased the remaining portion of the Michigan Interstate from Toledo, Ohio to Ann Arbor, Michigan in September 1985. The line north of Osmer remains under the ownership of the State of Michigan, except where the tracks have been removed. For a period in the 1980's three different companies operated the Ann Arbor tracks. Michigan Interstate operated from Toledo to Osmer. Tuscola and Saginaw Bay from Osmer north to Alma, and the Michigan Northern operated north of Alma. The collapse of the Michigan Northern resulted in the Tuscola and Saginaw Bay taking all operations north of Osmer. The Tuscola and Saginaw Bay later re-branded itself as the Great Lakes Central, the current operator of all remaining lines north of Osmer. The Michigan Interstate trackage was sold in 1988 to the Ann Arbor Acquisition Corporation, who later sold the line to WATCO, the current operator the segment from Toledo to Osmer. \n[[File:DTIRailroad.jpg|thumb|Work Train, circa 1921]]\n\n==The Pennsylvania years==\nThe line operated as an independent subsidiary of the [[Pennsylvania Railroad]] from 1929 until 1970.  In 1955, the line replaced its steam locomotives with diesel locomotives. The DT&I relied exclusively on diesel locomotives built by [[Electro-Motive Diesel|General Motors Electro-Motive Division]].\n\n==The later years==\n\nIn 1968, the DT&I's parent company, the Pennsylvania Railroad, merged with its longtime rival, the [[New York Central Railroad]], to become the [[Penn Central Transportation Company|Penn Central]], which declared [[bankruptcy]] two years later and sold off the DT&I to private investors. In 1980, the DT&I was acquired by the [[Grand Trunk Western Railroad]] (GTW). Under the GTW, the DT&I locomotives were painted in the red and blue livery of the GTW, but retained the DT&I logo. In December 1983, the DT&I was completely assimilated into the GTW.\n\n==End of service on southern portion==\n[[File:Detroit, Toledo and Ironton GP38AC 6210 and 6406 GP40-2 at CP Hill in Melrose Park in April 1985 (2) (29178291423).jpg|thumb|300px|Detroit, Toledo and Ironton at CP Hill in Melrose Park in April 1985]]\nIn April 1982, a collapse in Royersville Tunnel (the only tunnel on the old DT&I) prompted GTW to shut down the line between Jackson and Ironton. The tunnel had suffered collapses many times in the past but limited remaining business south of Jackson and the operational problems of the tunnel led to GTW's decision. At the same time, GTW bypassed the steep and treacherous Summithill section between Bainbridge and Waverly by rerouting trains onto Chessie System trackage from [[Washington Court House, Ohio]] to Waverly, then back onto the former DT&I to Jackson. In 1984 all operations south of Washington Court House were suspended, the Jackson Shops closed, and the track dismantled.\n\nA short section of the DT&I main west out of Jackson is still in place serving as a connection from industries to the only remaining line into Jackson. A short section of the DT&I north from the junction with the B&O Southwestern near Greenfield is still in place to serve local industry. Portions of the line between Greenfield and Washington Court House were purchased by Washington Court House with the intention of creating a rail-trail, but they were unable to acquire enough conjoined sections to build a trail.\n\n==Central and northern portions==\n[[File:Railway snowplow, Henry Ford Museum.jpg|thumb|1925 DT & I RR caboose on display at [[Henry Ford Museum]]]]\nGTW continued to operate the northern and central portions of the former DT&I as part of their network for many years. The DT&I trackage from Springfield to Lurray (near Washington Court House) was sold by GTW to the West Central Ohio Port Authority (formerly Clark County - Fayette County Port Authority) January 18, 1991. This section was then operated in conjunction with the former section of the B&O Toledo Division from Lurray to Washington Court House by the [[Indiana and Ohio Railway]], a division of Railtex. In 1997, GTW sold the former DT&I from Dundee (Diann) Michigan to Springfield, Ohio to the Indiana and Ohio Railway.

Ford recognized the strategic importance of the line to his [[automobile]] business;  the line connected [[Dearborn, Michigan]], to all of the major east-west rail lines in the [[Midwest]]. This gave Ford direct control over shipments of raw materials and finished [[product (business)|good]]s to and from his [[factory|factories]] in Dearborn. \n\nUnder Ford's management, the line thrived.  In the words of a later historian, \"the line was transformed from a streak of rust into an extremely efficient and profitable operation, the likes of which has or will seldom be seen in this country.\"<ref name=\":0\">{{cite web|url=http://www.michiganrailroads.com/RRHX/Stories/DT&I-TheRailroadThatWentNoPlacePart2.htm|title=DT&I - The Railroad That Went No Place|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20031219203716/http://www.michiganrailroads.com/RRHX/Stories/DT%26I-TheRailroadThatWentNoPlacePart2.htm|archivedate=19 December 2003|accessdate=2009-04-16|url-status=dead}}</ref>  Ford double-tracked the Detroit area main lines, and made a deal with the workers that they would take better care of the equipment in exchange for unusually high wages.  Moreover, Ford funded the purchase of new equipment.  For the daily Detroit-[[Bainbridge, Ross County, Ohio|Bainbridge, Ohio]] train, the DT&I purchased a pair of [[Doodlebug (rail car)|\"doodlebugs\"]]; for the intensive Detroit-area freight service, the line electrified as far as [[Flat Rock, Michigan|Flat Rock]] yard.  Ford hoped to electrify the entire line, and thence to an interchange with the [[Virginian Railway|Virginian]], but electrified at 22 kV 25 Hz AC, the wrong voltage for interoperable equipment (the Virginian electrified at 11 kV AC).  The concrete catenary masts of the electric years survived for decades after de-electrification, as it was deemed too expensive to demolish them; some remain today.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":1\">{{Cite journal|last=Van Hattem|first=Mark|last2=Hemphill|first2=Mark W.|date=Jun 2003|title=Trackside Guide No. 3 \u2014 Detroit, Michigan|journal=[[Trains (magazine)|Trains]]|volume=63|issue=6|pages=S1\u201312|id={{ProQuest|206653339}}}}</ref>  \n\nin 1929, Ford sold the line to a subsidiary of the [[Pennsylvania Railroad]] after becoming disgusted with what he considered interference and over-regulation from the [[Interstate Commerce Commission]].

But the 1908 bankruptcy forced the DT&I to divest its acquisition.\n\nIn 1963, the DT&I, by then a subsidiary of the [[Pennsylvania Railroad]], once again gained control of the AA. The Ann Arbor lines became part of [[Conrail]] in April 1976, and were facing abandonment. In October 1977, they were purchased by the state of Michigan, which intended to preserve rail service over its tracks. In 1977 Michigan Interstate was designated operator of the entire line from Toledo to Frankfurt. A series of disputes arose during the early 1980's and multiple railroads were designated by the tracks owners, the State of Michigan, to operate the line. The line from Toledo to just south of Osmer (a passing siding north of Ann Arbor) was sold to the trustee for the estate purchased the remaining portion of the Michigan Interstate from Toledo, Ohio to Ann Arbor, Michigan in September 1985. The line north of Osmer remains under the ownership of the State of Michigan, except where the tracks have been removed. For a period in the 1980's three different companies operated the Ann Arbor tracks. Michigan Interstate operated from Toledo to Osmer. Tuscola and Saginaw Bay from Osmer north to Alma, and the Michigan Northern operated north of Alma. The collapse of the Michigan Northern resulted in the Tuscola and Saginaw Bay taking all operations north of Osmer. The Tuscola and Saginaw Bay later re-branded itself as the Great Lakes Central, the current operator of all remaining lines north of Osmer. The Michigan Interstate trackage was sold in 1988 to the Ann Arbor Acquisition Corporation, who later sold the line to WATCO, the current operator the segment from Toledo to Osmer. \n[[File:DTIRailroad.jpg|thumb|Work Train, circa 1921]]\n\n==The Pennsylvania years==\nThe line operated as an independent subsidiary of the [[Pennsylvania Railroad]] from 1929 until 1970.  In 1955, the line replaced its steam locomotives with diesel locomotives. The DT&I relied exclusively on diesel locomotives built by [[Electro-Motive Diesel|General Motors Electro-Motive Division]].\n\n==The later years==\n\nIn 1968, the DT&I's parent company, the Pennsylvania Railroad, merged with its longtime rival, the [[New York Central Railroad]], to become the [[Penn Central Transportation Company|Penn Central]], which declared [[bankruptcy]] two years later and sold off the DT&I to private investors. In 1980, the DT&I was acquired by the [[Grand Trunk Western Railroad]] (GTW). Under the GTW, the DT&I locomotives were painted in the red and blue livery of the GTW, but retained the DT&I logo. In December 1983, the DT&I was completely assimilated into the GTW.\n\n==End of service on southern portion==\n[[File:Detroit, Toledo and Ironton GP38AC 6210 and 6406 GP40-2 at CP Hill in Melrose Park in April 1985 (2) (29178291423).jpg|thumb|300px|Detroit, Toledo and Ironton at CP Hill in Melrose Park in April 1985]]\nIn April 1982, a collapse in Royersville Tunnel (the only tunnel on the old DT&I) prompted GTW to shut down the line between Jackson and Ironton. The tunnel had suffered collapses many times in the past but limited remaining business south of Jackson and the operational problems of the tunnel led to GTW's decision. At the same time, GTW bypassed the steep and treacherous Summithill section between Bainbridge and Waverly by rerouting trains onto Chessie System trackage from [[Washington Court House, Ohio]] to Waverly, then back onto the former DT&I to Jackson. In 1984 all operations south of Washington Court House were suspended, the Jackson Shops closed, and the track dismantled.\n\nA short section of the DT&I main west out of Jackson is still in place serving as a connection from industries to the only remaining line into Jackson. A short section of the DT&I north from the junction with the B&O Southwestern near Greenfield is still in place to serve local industry. Portions of the line between Greenfield and Washington Court House were purchased by Washington Court House with the intention of creating a rail-trail, but they were unable to acquire enough conjoined sections to build a trail.\n\n==Central and northern portions==\n[[File:Railway snowplow, Henry Ford Museum.jpg|thumb|1925 DT & I RR caboose on display at [[Henry Ford Museum]]]]\nGTW continued to operate the northern and central portions of the former DT&I as part of their network for many years. The DT&I trackage from Springfield to Lurray (near Washington Court House) was sold by GTW to the West Central Ohio Port Authority (formerly Clark County - Fayette County Port Authority) January 18, 1991. This section was then operated in conjunction with the former section of the B&O Toledo Division from Lurray to Washington Court House by the [[Indiana and Ohio Railway]], a division of Railtex. In 1997, GTW sold the former DT&I from Dundee (Diann) Michigan to Springfield, Ohio to the Indiana and Ohio Railway. Included in the sale was trackage rights from Dundee to Flat Rock, MI over the old DT&I. Railtex was merged into [[RailAmerica]], which was then purchased by [[Genesee & Wyoming]].
