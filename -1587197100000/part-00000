This state shared only the name with the historical region, containing mostly [[Hesse|Hessian]] and [[Eastphalia]]n regions and only a relatively small part of the region of [[Westphalia]].\n\nAlthough Prussia had long owned territory in Westphalia, King [[Frederick William III of Prussia|Frederick William III]] had preferred to incorporate the [[Kingdom of Saxony]] first. It was not until the [[Congress of Vienna]] in 1815 that the Province of Westphalia came into being.

This is because viruses are unable to go through cell division, as they are acellular\u2013meaning they lack the genetic information that encode the necessary tools for protein synthesis or generation of metabolic energy; hence they rely on their host to replicate and multiply. Using the host cell's machinery the virus generates copies of its genome and produces new viruses for the survival of its kind and the infection of new hosts.The [[viral replication]] process varies depending on the virus's genome.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n=== Classification ===\nIn 1971 [[David Baltimore]], a [[Nobel Prize]]-winning biologist, created a system called [[Baltimore Classification System]].According to this system, viruses are classified into seven classes  based on their replication strategy:<ref name=\":1\" /><ref>{{Cite book|title=Introduction to Modern Virology|last=Dimmock|first=Nigel|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|year=2007|isbn=978-1-119-97810-7|location=|pages=}}</ref>\n* Class I: Double-stranded DNA. Depending on the location of genome replication, this class can be subdivided into two groups: (a) viruses in which replication happens exclusively in the nucleus and is thus relatively dependent on cellular factors; (b) viruses replicating in cytoplasm that are mostly independent of cellular machinery due to the fact that they have acquired all needed factors for their genome's  transcription and replication.<ref name=\":1\" />\n* Class II: Single-stranded DNA.  These viruses only replicate in the nucleus. A double-stranded intermediate is formed during the replication process that serves as a template for the synthesis of virus's single-stranded  DNA.<ref name=\":1\" />\n* Class III: Double-stranded RNA. The viruses in this class have segmented genomes. Each segment is transcribed individually to produce a monochromatic mRNA that codes for only one protein.<ref name=\":1\" />     \n* Class IV: Single-stranded RNA - Positive-sense. The genome of these viruses are [[positive-sense RNA]]<nowiki/>s, in which the RNA is directly translated into a [[viral protein]]. These viruses can be subdivided into two groups depending on their translation process: (a) viruses with polycistronic mRNA, in which the RNA translates into multiple protein products; (b) viruses with more complex transcription than the first group where either subgenomic RNAs or two rounds of translation are necessary to produce the genomic RNA.<ref name=\":1\" />    \n* Class V: Single-stranded RNA - Negative-sense. All viruses in this class have [[negative-sense RNA]]s, in which the RNA complements mRNA, transcribes into a positive-sense RNA via a viral [[polymerase]], and translates into viral protein.The viruses in this class either have segmented or unsegmented RNA; either way, replication occurs within the cell's cytoplasm.<ref name=\":1\" />     \n* Class VI: Single-stranded positive-sense RNA with DNA intermediate. These viruses use [[reverse transcriptase]] to convert the positive-sense RNA ( as the template) into DNA. [[Retroviruses]] are the most well-known family among this class.<ref name=\":1\" />     \n* Class VII: Double-stranded DNA with RNA intermediate.  The genome of these viruses are gapped, double-stranded, and subsequently become filled to form [[cccDNA]]<nowiki/> (covalently closed circular DNA). This group also use the reverse transcription during the process of maturation.<ref name=\":1\" />      \n[[File:Viral Replication Cycle.svg|thumb|Viral replication cycle - simplified]]\n\n=== Replication cycle ===\nRegardless of the differences among viral species, they all share six basic replication stages:<ref name=\":1\" /><ref>Collier, Leslie; Balows, Albert; Sussman, Max (1998) ''Topley and Wilson's Microbiology and Microbial Infections'' ninth edition, Volume 1, ''Virology'', volume editors: Mahy, Brian and Collier, Leslie. Arnold. {{ISBN|0-340-66316-2}}.</ref>\n\n'''Attachment''' is the cycle's starting point and consists of specific bindings between anti-receptors (or virus-attachment proteins) and cellular receptors molecules such as (glyco)proteins. The host range of a virus is determined by the specificity of the binding. The attachment causes the viral protein to change its configuration and thus fuse with the host's cell membrane; thereby enabling the virus to enter the cell.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n[[Viral entry|Penetration]] of virus happens either through [[Membrane fusion protein|membrane fusion]] or receptor-mediated [[endocytosis]] and leads to [[viral entry]]. Due to their rigid [[cellulose]]-made\n\n(chitin in case of fungal cells) cell walls, plants and fungal cells get infected differently than animal cells. Often, a cell wall trauma is required for the virus to enter the cell.<ref name=\":0\">Dimmock, N.J; Easton, Andrew J; Leppard, Keith (2007) ''Introduction to Modern Virology'' sixth edition, Blackwell Publishing, {{ISBN|1-4051-3645-6}}.</ref>\n\nUncoating is the removal of viral [[capsid]], which makes the viral nucleic acids available for transcription. The capsid could have been degraded by either host or viral enzymes, releasing the viral genome into the cell.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n[[Viral replication|Replication]] is the multiplication of virus's genetic material. The process includes the transcription of mRNA, synthesis, and assembly of viral proteins and is regulated by protein expression.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nAssembly process involves putting together and modifying newly-made viral nucleic acids and structural proteins to form the virus's nucleocapsid.<ref name=\":1\" /><ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Barman | first1 = S | last2 = Ali | first2 = A | last3 = Hui | first3 = EK | last4 = Adhikary | first4 = L | last5 = Nayak | first5 = DP | year = 2001 | title = Transport of viral proteins to the apical membranes and interaction of matrix protein with glycoproteins in the assembly of influenza viruses | url = | journal = Virus Res. | volume = 77 | issue = 1| pages = 61\u20139 | doi = 10.1016/S0168-1702(01)00266-0 | pmid = 11451488 }}</ref>\n\nRelease of viruses could be done by two different mechanisms depending on the type of virus. Lytic viruses burst the cell's membrane or wall through a process called [[lysis]] in order to release themselves. On the other hand, enveloped viruses become released by a process called [[budding]] in which a virus obtain its lipid membrane as it buds out of the cell through membrane or intracellular [[Vesicle (biology and chemistry)|vesicle]]. Both lysis and budding processes are highly damaging to the cell, with the exception of [[retrovirus]]es, and often result in the cell's death.<ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==Viral pathogenesis==\n[[Pathogen]]icity is the ability of one organism to cause disease in another. There is a specialized field of study in [[virology]] called [[viral pathogenesis]] in which it studies how viruses infect their hosts at the molecular and cellular level.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nIn order for the viral disease to develop several steps need to be taken. First, the virus has to enter the body and implant itself into a tissue ( e.g. respiratory tissue). Second, the virus has to reproduce extracellular after invading in order to make ample copies of itself. Third, the synthesized viruses must spread throughout the body via circulatory systems or nerve cells.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Medical Microbiology Chapter 45 Viral Pathogenesis|last=Baron|first=S|publisher=|year=1996|isbn=|location=Galveston (TX)|pages=}}</ref>\n[[File:Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection x400.jpg|thumb|Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection usually produces widespread bronchiolitis and interstitial pneumonia which may sometimes by associated with giant cells. This image shows a non-specific interstitial pneumonia pattern with no giant cells present.]]\nWith regards to viral diseases it is essential to look at two aspects: (a) the direct effect of virus replication; (b) the body's responses to infection. The course and severity of all viral infections are determined by the dynamic between the virus and the host. Common symptoms of virus infections are fever, body aches, inflammation, and skin rashes. Most of these symptoms are caused by our immune system's response to infection and are not the direct effect of viral replication.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n=== Cytopathis effects of virus ===\nOften it is possible to recognize virus-infected cells through a number of common phenotypic changes referred to as cytopathis effects. These changes include:<ref name=\":1\" />\n* Altered shape: The shape of adherent cells\u2013 cells that attach themselves to other cells or artificial substrates\u2014 may change from flat to round. In addition, the cell's extensions resembling tendrils \u2013 involved in cell's mobility and attachments\u2014are withdrawn into the cell.<ref name=\":1\" /> \n* Detachment from the substrate: Happens as a result of adherent cells' damage. The cell damage is due to partial degradation of [[cytoskeleton]].<ref name=\":1\" />\n* Lysis: In this case the entire cell breaks down because of the absorption of [[extracellular fluid]] and swelling. Not all viruses cause lysis.<ref name=\":1\" />\n* [[Lipid bilayer fusion|Membrane fusion]]: The adjacent cells' membranes fuse together and produce a mass called [[syncytium]], in which the cytoplasm contains more than one nucleus and appears as a giant cell. These cells have a short lifespan compared to other cells.<ref name=\":1\" /> \n* Increase in Membrane permeability: Viruses can increase the membrane permeability which allows many extracellular ions( e.g. iodine and sodium ions) to enter the cell.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n==Viral infections==\nThere are five different types of viral infections:<ref name=\":1\" />\n* [[Infection|Abortive infection]]: This kind of infection occurs when a virus successfully invades a host cell but is unable to complete its full replication cycle and produce more infectious viruses.<ref name=\":1\" />\n[[File:Ebola virus virion.jpg|thumb|Ebola virus virion. Created by GC microbiologist Cynthia Goldsmith, this colorized transmission electron micrograph (TEM) revealed some of the ultrastructural morphology displayed by an Ebola virus virion.]]\n* Acute infection: Many common viral infections fallow this pattern. Acute infections are brief since they are often completely eliminated by the immune system. Acute infection is frequently associated with epidemics since most of virus replication happens before the onset of symptoms.<ref name=\":1\" />\n* Chronic infection: These infections have a prolonged course and are hard to eliminate since the virus stays in the host for a significant period.<ref name=\":1\" /> \n* Persistent infection: There is a delicate balance between the host and the virus in this pattern. The virus adjusts its replication and pathogenecitiy levels to keep the host alive for its own benefit. While it is possible for the virus to live and replicate inside the host for its entire lifetime, oftentimes the host eventually eliminates the virus.<ref name=\":1\" /> \n* Latent infection: Being the ultimate infection, the latent virus infections tend to exist inside the host for its entire lifetime. A well-known example of such infection is the [[Herpes simplex|herpes]] simplex virus in humans. This virus is able to stop its replication and restrict its gene expression in order to stop the recognition of the infected cell by the host's immune system.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n=== Prevention and treatment ===\nViral [[vaccine]]s contain inactivated viruses which have lost their ability to replicate. These vaccines can prevent or lower the intensity of viral illness. Developing vaccines against smallpox, polio, and hepatitis B over the past 50 years has had a significant impact on world health and thus on global population. Nevertheless, there have been ongoing viral outbreaks    ( such as the [[Ebola]] and [[Zika virus]]es) in the past few years affecting millions of people all around the globe.<ref>\"2014 Ebola Virus Disease Outbreak in West Africa\".

This is because viruses are unable to go through cell division, as they are acellular\u2013meaning they lack the genetic information that encode the necessary tools for protein synthesis or generation of metabolic energy; hence they rely on their host to replicate and multiply. Using the host cell's machinery the virus generates copies of its genome and produces new viruses for the survival of its kind and the infection of new hosts.The [[viral replication]] process varies depending on the virus's genome.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n=== Classification ===\nIn 1971 [[David Baltimore]], a [[Nobel Prize]]-winning biologist, created a system called [[Baltimore Classification System]].According to this system, viruses are classified into seven classes  based on their replication strategy:<ref name=\":1\" /><ref>{{Cite book|title=Introduction to Modern Virology|last=Dimmock|first=Nigel|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|year=2007|isbn=978-1-119-97810-7|location=|pages=}}</ref>\n* Class I: Double-stranded DNA. Depending on the location of genome replication, this class can be subdivided into two groups: (a) viruses in which replication happens exclusively in the nucleus and is thus relatively dependent on cellular factors; (b) viruses replicating in cytoplasm that are mostly independent of cellular machinery due to the fact that they have acquired all needed factors for their genome's  transcription and replication.<ref name=\":1\" />\n* Class II: Single-stranded DNA.  These viruses only replicate in the nucleus. A double-stranded intermediate is formed during the replication process that serves as a template for the synthesis of virus's single-stranded  DNA.<ref name=\":1\" />\n* Class III: Double-stranded RNA. The viruses in this class have segmented genomes. Each segment is transcribed individually to produce a monochromatic mRNA that codes for only one protein.<ref name=\":1\" />     \n* Class IV: Single-stranded RNA - Positive-sense. The genome of these viruses are [[positive-sense RNA]]<nowiki/>s, in which the RNA is directly translated into a [[viral protein]]. These viruses can be subdivided into two groups depending on their translation process: (a) viruses with polycistronic mRNA, in which the RNA translates into multiple protein products; (b) viruses with more complex transcription than the first group where either subgenomic RNAs or two rounds of translation are necessary to produce the genomic RNA.<ref name=\":1\" />    \n* Class V: Single-stranded RNA - Negative-sense. All viruses in this class have [[negative-sense RNA]]s, in which the RNA complements mRNA, transcribes into a positive-sense RNA via a viral [[polymerase]], and translates into viral protein.The viruses in this class either have segmented or unsegmented RNA; either way, replication occurs within the cell's cytoplasm.<ref name=\":1\" />     \n* Class VI: Single-stranded positive-sense RNA with DNA intermediate. These viruses use [[reverse transcriptase]] to convert the positive-sense RNA ( as the template) into DNA. [[Retroviruses]] are the most well-known family among this class.<ref name=\":1\" />     \n* Class VII: Double-stranded DNA with RNA intermediate.  The genome of these viruses are gapped, double-stranded, and subsequently become filled to form [[cccDNA]]<nowiki/> (covalently closed circular DNA). This group also use the reverse transcription during the process of maturation.<ref name=\":1\" />      \n[[File:Viral Replication Cycle.svg|thumb|Viral replication cycle - simplified]]\n\n=== Replication cycle ===\nRegardless of the differences among viral species, they all share six basic replication stages:<ref name=\":1\" /><ref>Collier, Leslie; Balows, Albert; Sussman, Max (1998) ''Topley and Wilson's Microbiology and Microbial Infections'' ninth edition, Volume 1, ''Virology'', volume editors: Mahy, Brian and Collier, Leslie.

The host range of a virus is determined by the specificity of the binding. The attachment causes the viral protein to change its configuration and thus fuse with the host's cell membrane; thereby enabling the virus to enter the cell.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n[[Viral entry|Penetration]] of virus happens either through [[Membrane fusion protein|membrane fusion]] or receptor-mediated [[endocytosis]] and leads to [[viral entry]]. Due to their rigid [[cellulose]]-made\n\n(chitin in case of fungal cells) cell walls, plants and fungal cells get infected differently than animal cells. Often, a cell wall trauma is required for the virus to enter the cell.<ref name=\":0\">Dimmock, N.J; Easton, Andrew J; Leppard, Keith (2007) ''Introduction to Modern Virology'' sixth edition, Blackwell Publishing, {{ISBN|1-4051-3645-6}}.</ref>\n\nUncoating is the removal of viral [[capsid]], which makes the viral nucleic acids available for transcription.

Lytic viruses burst the cell's membrane or wall through a process called [[lysis]] in order to release themselves. On the other hand, enveloped viruses become released by a process called [[budding]] in which a virus obtain its lipid membrane as it buds out of the cell through membrane or intracellular [[Vesicle (biology and chemistry)|vesicle]]. Both lysis and budding processes are highly damaging to the cell, with the exception of [[retrovirus]]es, and often result in the cell's death.<ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==Viral pathogenesis==\n[[Pathogen]]icity is the ability of one organism to cause disease in another. There is a specialized field of study in [[virology]] called [[viral pathogenesis]] in which it studies how viruses infect their hosts at the molecular and cellular level.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nIn order for the viral disease to develop several steps need to be taken. First, the virus has to enter the body and implant itself into a tissue ( e.g. respiratory tissue). Second, the virus has to reproduce extracellular after invading in order to make ample copies of itself. Third, the synthesized viruses must spread throughout the body via circulatory systems or nerve cells.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Medical Microbiology Chapter 45 Viral Pathogenesis|last=Baron|first=S|publisher=|year=1996|isbn=|location=Galveston (TX)|pages=}}</ref>\n[[File:Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection x400.jpg|thumb|Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection usually produces widespread bronchiolitis and interstitial pneumonia which may sometimes by associated with giant cells.

The course and severity of all viral infections are determined by the dynamic between the virus and the host. Common symptoms of virus infections are fever, body aches, inflammation, and skin rashes.

(PRC), and [[Chairman of the Central Military Commission|Chairman]] of the [[Central Military Commission (China)|Central Military Commission]] (CMC). Xi has been the [[paramount leader]], the [[Orders of precedence in China|highest-ranking]] official in China, since 2012 and he officially received the title of \"[[leadership core]]\" from the CPC in 2016. Xi has also been a member of the 17th, 18th, 19th [[Politburo Standing Committee of the Communist Party of China|CPC Politburo Standing Committee]] since 2007.\n\nThe son of Chinese Communist veteran [[Xi Zhongxun]], he was exiled to rural [[Yanchuan County]] as a teenager following his father's purge during the [[Cultural Revolution]], and lived in a cave in the village of Liangjiahe, where he worked as the party secretary. After studying [[chemical engineering]] at the [[Tsinghua University]] as a \"[[Worker-Peasant-Soldier student]]\", Xi rose through the ranks politically in China's coastal provinces. Xi was governor of [[Fujian]] from 1999 to 2002. He was also governor, then [[Party Committee Secretary|party secretary]] of neighbouring [[Zhejiang]] from 2002 to 2007. Following the dismissal of the party secretary of Shanghai [[Chen Liangyu]], Xi was transferred to replace him for a brief period in 2007. He joined the [[Politburo Standing Committee of the Communist Party of China|Politburo Standing Committee]] and [[Secretariat of the Communist Party of China Central Committee|central secretariat]] in October 2007, spending the next five years as Chinese paramount leader [[Hu Jintao|Hu Jintao's]] presumed [[Succession of power in the People's Republic of China|successor]].

Since assuming power, Xi has introduced far-ranging measures to enforce party discipline and to impose internal unity. His [[Anti-corruption campaign under Xi Jinping|anti-corruption campaign]] has led to the downfall of prominent incumbent and retired Communist Party officials, including members of the Politburo Standing Committee. He has also enacted or promoted more assertive foreign policy, particularly with regard to [[China\u2013Japan relations]], [[Territorial disputes in the South China Sea|China's claims]] in the [[South China Sea Islands|South China Sea]], and its advocacy for [[free trade]] and [[globalization]].

However, Xi and his colleagues acknowledge the challenges to the legitimacy of Communist rule, particularly corruption by party officials. The answer, according to Xi's programme, is two-fold: strengthen the party from within, by streamlining strict party discipline and initiating a large anti-corruption campaign to remove unsavoury elements from within the party, and re-instituting the Mass Line Campaign externally to make party officials better understand and serve the needs of ordinary people. Xi believes that, just as the party must be at the apex of political control of the state, the party's central authorities (i.e., the Politburo, PSC, or himself as general secretary) must exercise

(PRC), and [[Chairman of the Central Military Commission|Chairman]] of the [[Central Military Commission (China)|Central Military Commission]] (CMC). Xi has been the [[paramount leader]], the [[Orders of precedence in China|highest-ranking]] official in China, since 2012 and he officially received the title of \"[[leadership core]]\" from the CPC in 2016. Xi has also been a member of the 17th, 18th, 19th [[Politburo Standing Committee of the Communist Party of China|CPC Politburo Standing Committee]] since 2007.\n\nThe son of Chinese Communist veteran [[Xi Zhongxun]], he was exiled to rural [[Yanchuan County]] as a teenager following his father's purge during the [[Cultural Revolution]], and lived in a cave in the village of Liangjiahe, where he worked as the party secretary. After studying [[chemical engineering]] at the [[Tsinghua University]] as a \"[[Worker-Peasant-Soldier student]]\", Xi rose through the ranks politically in China's coastal provinces. Xi was governor of [[Fujian]] from 1999 to 2002. He was also governor, then [[Party Committee Secretary|party secretary]] of neighbouring [[Zhejiang]] from 2002 to 2007. Following the dismissal of the party secretary of Shanghai [[Chen Liangyu]], Xi was transferred to replace him for a brief period in 2007. He joined the [[Politburo Standing Committee of the Communist Party of China|Politburo Standing Committee]] and [[Secretariat of the Communist Party of China Central Committee|central secretariat]] in October 2007, spending the next five years as Chinese paramount leader [[Hu Jintao|Hu Jintao's]] presumed [[Succession of power in the People's Republic of China|successor]].

Since assuming power, Xi has introduced far-ranging measures to enforce party discipline and to impose internal unity. His [[Anti-corruption campaign under Xi Jinping|anti-corruption campaign]] has led to the downfall of prominent incumbent and retired Communist Party officials, including members of the Politburo Standing Committee. He has also enacted or promoted more assertive foreign policy, particularly with regard to [[China\u2013Japan relations]], [[Territorial disputes in the South China Sea|China's claims]] in the [[South China Sea Islands|South China Sea]], and its advocacy for [[free trade]] and [[globalization]].

However, Xi and his colleagues acknowledge the challenges to the legitimacy of Communist rule, particularly corruption by party officials. The answer, according to Xi's programme, is two-fold: strengthen the party from within, by streamlining strict party discipline and initiating a large anti-corruption campaign to remove unsavoury elements from within the party, and re-instituting the Mass Line Campaign externally to make party officials better understand and serve the needs of ordinary people. Xi believes that, just as the party must be at the apex of political control of the state, the party's central authorities (i.e., the Politburo, PSC, or himself as general secretary) must exercise

He specialises in Romanticism and the poetry of [[John Keats]], surveillance studies and ecocriticism. He is professor of English Literature at [[Aberystwyth University]], and between 2013 and 2018 was that institution's Professor of Engagement with the Public Imagination. \n\n==Life==\nMarggraf Turley was born in the [[Forest of Dean]]. He moved to Wales at the age of seven, was educated at [[King Henry VIII School, Abergavenny]], and read English at [[University of Leeds|Leeds University]].\n\n== Writer ==\nHe is author of three poetry collections: ''The Fossil Box'' (2007), concerned with the urgency of place and origins; ''Whiteout'' (2006), co-authored with Damian Walford Davies; and ''Wan-Hu's Flying Chair'' (2009), which won the 2010 [[Wales Book of the Year]] 'People's Choice' prize.\n\nIn 2007, he won first prize in the tenth-anniversary [[Keats-Shelley Prize for Poetry]]. His poem, [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/donotmigrate/3668962/Elisions-by-Richard-Marggraf-Turley.html 'Elisions'], was written on the competition theme of slavery.\n\nIn 2010, together with Professor Reyer Zwiggelaar and Dr Bashar Rajoub of the Computer Science department at Aberystwyth University, Marggraf Turley conducted a 'Valentine's Day experiment' using thermal imaging cameras to determine whether reading love poetry produced distinct thermal signatures on the faces of volunteers.<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/science/blog/2010/feb/13/valentines-love-poetry-hot-blood ''Guardian'' newspaper feature].</ref> \n\nIn March 2012, new research on Keats's ode 'To Autumn', co-authored with Dr Jayne Archer and Professor Howard Thomas (Aberystwyth University), was widely reported. Archival discoveries suggested that the 'stubble-plains' of Keats's ode '[[To Autumn]]' were located on St Giles's Hill, to the east of the City of Winchester, with implications for a new political reading of the poem. The part of St Giles's Hill in question now lies under a [[multi-storey car park]].<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/mar/23/john-keats-autumnal-idealist-social-commentator ''Guardian'' newspaper feature].</ref><ref>[http://blog.oup.com/2012/03/keats-ode-autumn-winchester-field/ Oxford University Press blog].</ref><ref>[http://www.dailyecho.co.uk/news/9613743.Keats__rural_idyll_now_a_car_park/ ''Southern Daily Echo''].</ref><ref>[http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2119109/Ode-NCP-How-cornfield-inspired-1819-poem-Keats-multi-storey-car-park.html ''Daily Mail'' newspaper feature].</ref> The editor of the Telegraph devoted 22 March 2012's editorial to an 'Ode to a Car Park'<ref>[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/comment/telegraph-view/9160657/Ode-to-a-Car-Park.html ''Telegraph'' editorial].</ref>\n\nIn 2013, research by Marggraf Turley, Archer and Thomas on the importance of Shakespeare's business dealings as a grain merchant for such plays as [[King Lear]] and [[Coriolanus]] was widely reported.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-mid-wales-21993857|title=Shakespeare's past as food hoarder|date=2013-04-01|work=BBC News|access-date=2018-01-15|language=en-GB}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/bad-bard-a-tax-dodger-and-famine-profiteer-69qc5hrf2m3|title=Bad Bard: a tax dodger and famine profiteer|last=Leake|first=Jonathan|date=2013-03-31|work=The Sunday Times|access-date=2018-01-15|issn=0956-1382}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2301829/Was-Shakespeare-tax-dodger-Bard-ruthless-businessman-exploited-famine-faced-jail-cheating-revenue.html|title=Was Shakespeare a tax dodger?

His poem, [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/donotmigrate/3668962/Elisions-by-Richard-Marggraf-Turley.html 'Elisions'], was written on the competition theme of slavery.\n\nIn 2010, together with Professor Reyer Zwiggelaar and Dr Bashar Rajoub of the Computer Science department at Aberystwyth University, Marggraf Turley conducted a 'Valentine's Day experiment' using thermal imaging cameras to determine whether reading love poetry produced distinct thermal signatures on the faces of volunteers.<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/science/blog/2010/feb/13/valentines-love-poetry-hot-blood ''Guardian'' newspaper feature].</ref> \n\nIn March 2012, new research on Keats's ode 'To Autumn', co-authored with Dr Jayne Archer and Professor Howard Thomas (Aberystwyth University), was widely reported. Archival discoveries suggested that the 'stubble-plains' of Keats's ode '[[To Autumn]]' were located on St Giles's Hill, to the east of the City of Winchester, with implications for a new political reading of the poem. The part of St Giles's Hill in question now lies under a [[multi-storey car park]].<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/mar/23/john-keats-autumnal-idealist-social-commentator ''Guardian'' newspaper feature].</ref><ref>[http://blog.oup.com/2012/03/keats-ode-autumn-winchester-field/ Oxford University Press blog].</ref><ref>[http://www.dailyecho.co.uk/news/9613743.Keats__rural_idyll_now_a_car_park/ ''Southern Daily Echo''].</ref><ref>[http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2119109/Ode-NCP-How-cornfield-inspired-1819-poem-Keats-multi-storey-car-park.html ''Daily Mail'' newspaper feature].</ref> The editor of the Telegraph devoted 22 March 2012's editorial to an 'Ode to a Car Park'<ref>[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/comment/telegraph-view/9160657/Ode-to-a-Car-Park.html ''Telegraph'' editorial].</ref>\n\nIn 2013, research by Marggraf Turley, Archer and Thomas on the importance of Shakespeare's business dealings as a grain merchant for such plays as [[King Lear]] and [[Coriolanus]] was widely reported.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-mid-wales-21993857|title=Shakespeare's past as food hoarder|date=2013-04-01|work=BBC News|access-date=2018-01-15|language=en-GB}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/bad-bard-a-tax-dodger-and-famine-profiteer-69qc5hrf2m3|title=Bad Bard: a tax dodger and famine profiteer|last=Leake|first=Jonathan|date=2013-03-31|work=The Sunday Times|access-date=2018-01-15|issn=0956-1382}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2301829/Was-Shakespeare-tax-dodger-Bard-ruthless-businessman-exploited-famine-faced-jail-cheating-revenue.html|title=Was Shakespeare a tax dodger?
