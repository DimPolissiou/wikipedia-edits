Rationing controls the size of the '''ration''', which is one's allowed portion of the resources being distributed on a particular day or at a particular time. There are many forms of rationing,\nand in western civilization people experience some of them in daily life without realizing it.<ref>Cox, Stan (2013). [https://thenewpress.com/books/any-way-you-slice-it \"Any way you slice it: The past, present and future of rationing\"]. New Press Books.</ref>\n\nRationing is often done to keep price below the equilibrium ([[market clearing|market-clearing]]) price determined by the process of [[supply and demand]] in an [[free market|unfettered market]]. Thus, rationing can be complementary to [[incomes policies|price controls]]. An example of rationing in the face of rising prices took place in the various countries where there was rationing of gasoline during the [[1973 energy crisis]].\n\nA reason for setting the price lower than would clear the market may be that there is a shortage, which would drive the market price very high. High prices, especially in the case of necessities, are undesirable with regard to those who cannot afford them. Traditionalist economists argue, however, that high prices act to reduce waste of the scarce resource while also providing incentive to produce more.\n\nRationing using [[ration stamp]]s is only one kind of non-price rationing. For example, [[scarcity|scarce]] products can be rationed using queues. This is seen, for example, at [[amusement park]]s, where one pays a price to get in and then need not pay any price to go on the rides. Similarly, in the absence of [[road pricing]], access to roads is rationed in a [[first come, first served]] [[queueing]] process, leading to [[traffic congestion|congestion]].\n\nAuthorities which introduce rationing often have to deal with the rationed goods being sold illegally on the [[black market]]. Despite the fact that rationing systems are sometimes necessary as the only viable option for societies facing severe consumer goods shortages, they are usually extremely unpopular with the general public, as they enforce limits on individual consumption.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://sos.oregon.gov/archives/exhibits/ww2/Pages/services-rationing.aspx|title=Oregon Secretary of State: Rationing: A Necessary But Hated Sacrifice|website=sos.oregon.gov|access-date=2019-09-22}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://museumcrush.org/how-the-ministry-of-food-managed-food-rationing-in-world-war-two/|title=How the Ministry of Food managed food rationing in World War Two \u2013 Museum Crush|website=museumcrush.org|access-date=2019-09-22}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/dec/24/food-rationing-crises-public-health-problem-obesity-hunger-big-government|title=Could rationing hold the key to today's food crises? {{!}} Zoe Williams|last=Williams|first=Zoe|date=2013-12-24|work=The Guardian|access-date=2019-09-22|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}</ref>\n\n==Civilian rationing==\nRationing has been instituted during wartime for civilians. For example, each person may be given what's known as a \u201cration coupon\u201d allowing him or her to purchase a certain amount of a product each month. Rationing often includes [[food]] and other necessities for which there is a shortage, including materials needed for the war effort such as [[rubber]] [[tire]]s, [[leather]] [[shoe]]s, [[clothing]] and [[fuel]].\n\nRationing of food and water may also become necessary during an emergency, such as a [[natural disaster]] or [[Terrorism|terror attack]]. In the U.S., the [[Federal Emergency Management Agency]] (FEMA) has established guidelines for civilians on rationing food and water supplies when replacements are not available. According to FEMA standards, every person should have a minimum of {{convert|1|USqt|litre}} per day of water, and more for children, nursing mothers and the ill.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fema.gov/pdf/library/f&web.pdf|publisher=FEMA|title=Food and Water in an Emergency}}</ref>\n\n===Origins===\n[[File:Lebensmittel Karikatur, item 1.jpg|thumb|right|[[First World War]] German government propaganda poster describing rationing with personifications of meat, bread, sugar, butter, milk and meal (1916)]]\nMilitary [[siege]]s have often resulted in shortages of food and other essential consumables.

[[Ration Stamps|Ration stamps]] were often used. These were redeemable stamps or coupons, and every family was issued a set number of each kind of stamp based on the size of the family, ages of children and income. The British [[Minister of Food (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Food]] refined the rationing process in the early 1940s to ensure the population did not starve when food imports were severely restricted and local production limited due to the large number of men fighting the war.<ref name=\"suckingeggs\">{{cite book|title=Sucking Eggs|first=Patricia|last=Nicol|url=http://www.vintage-books.co.uk |publisher=Vintage Books|year=2010|ISBN=9780099521129}}</ref>\n\nRationing on a scientific basis was pioneered by [[Elsie Widdowson]] and [[Robert McCance]] at the Department of Experimental Medicine, [[University of Cambridge]]. They worked on the chemical composition of the human body, and on the nutritional value of different flours used to make bread. Widdowson also studied the impact of infant diet on human growth. They studied the differing effects from deficiencies of salt and of water and produced the first tables to compare the different nutritional content of foods before and after cooking. They co-authored ''The Chemical Composition of Foods'', first published in 1940 by the [[Medical Research Council (UK)|Medical Research Council]]. Their book \"McCance and Widdowson\" became known as the dietician's bible and formed the basis for modern nutritional thinking.<ref name=\"bbc\">{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/6228307.stm|work=BBC News|title=Elsie - mother of the modern loaf|date=2007-03-25|first=Jane|last=Elliott}}</ref>\n\n[[File:INF3-96 Food Production Dig for Victory Artist Peter Fraser.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Poster for the \"[[Victory garden|Dig for Victory]]\" campaign, encouraging Britons to supplement their rations by cultivating gardens and [[Allotment (gardening)|allotments]]]]\nIn 1939, they tested whether the United Kingdom could survive with only domestic food production if [[U-boat]]s ended all imports. Using 1938 food-production data, they fed themselves and other volunteers a limited diet, while simulating the strenuous wartime physical work Britons would likely have to perform. The scientists found that the subjects' health and performance remained very good after three months. They also headed the first ever mandated addition of vitamins and mineral to food, beginning with adding [[calcium]] to bread.

In particular, daily bread rations in [[Siege of Leningrad|sieged Leningrad]] were initially set at 800 grams. By the end of 1941 the bread rations were reduced to 250 grams for workers and 125 for everyone else, which resulted in [[Effect of the Siege of Leningrad on the city#Food shortages|surge of deaths]] caused by starvation. Starting from 1942 daily bread rations were increased to 350 grams for workers and 200 grams for everyone else. One of the documents of the period is the diary of [[Tanya Savicheva]], who recorded the deaths of each member of her family during the siege.\n\nRationing was also introduced to a number of British dominions, and colonies, with rationing of clothing imposed in Australia, from 12 June 1942, and certain foodstuffs from 1943. Canada rationed tea, coffee, sugar, butter and mechanical spares, between 1942 and 1947. Cochin, Travancore and Madras states, of British India, elected to ration grain between the fall of 1943, and Spring 1944.

Every month, each citizen would get food coupons worth 6 [[Israeli pound]]s, and every family would be allotted a given amount of food. The average Israeli diet was 2,800 calories a day, with additional calories for children, the elderly, and pregnant women.\n\nFollowing the 1952 [[Reparations Agreement between Israel and West Germany|reparations agreement]] with West Germany, and the subsequent influx of foreign capital, Israel's struggling economy was bolstered, and in 1953, most restrictions were cancelled.

Rationing started being phased out in the year 2000 at the end of the \"special period\", as Cuba had shifted to a more diversified and self-sustaining economy. Rationing, however, was not fully abolished and instead turned into an alternative way to purchase goods, in addition to the markets. This makes a curious departure from classical rationing, as during the 2001-2019 period, the rationing system was used in addition to, instead of as a replacement for regular markets. Cubans would be able to buy a certain amount of items at 'liberated' prices using ration coupons at a significantly reduced rate, while still being able to purchase more at regular market prices. This 'liberated' system persisted even during Cuba's period of economic growth and relative prosperity during the early and mid 2010s and enjoyed considerable popularity among the island's citizens. Cuba later re-introduced a classical limiting rationing system in 2019, following the imposition of strict sanctions on the island by US President [[Donald Trump]], as well as the collapse of oil shipments from [[Venezuela]], which was facing its own economic troubles at that time. Cuba's president pitched the new system as significantly more lenient than the 1991-2000 \"special period\", though admitted that it would negatively affect consumption.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Garth|first=Hanna|title=THINGS BECAME SCARCE: FOOD AVAILABILITY AND ACCESSIBILITY IN SANTIAGO de CUBA THEN AND NOW|url=https://www.academia.edu/965534/THINGS_BECAME_SCARCE_FOOD_AVAILABILITY_AND_ACCESSIBILITY_IN_SANTIAGO_de_CUBA_THEN_AND_NOW|journal=NAPA Bulletin|language=en|volume=32|issue=1|pages=178\u2013192|issn=1556-4789}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://archive.boston.com/news/world/latinamerica/articles/2009/11/07/cuba_cuts_back_on_rationed_products/|title=Cuba cuts back on rationed products|last=Haven|first=Paul|date=2009-11-07|work=Boston.com|access-date=2019-09-22}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.dw.com/en/cuba-to-widen-food-rationing-as-supply-crisis-bites/a-48695569|title=Cuba to widen food rationing as supply crisis bites {{!}} DW {{!}} 11.05.2019|last=Welle (www.dw.com)|first=Deutsche|website=DW.COM|language=en-GB|access-date=2019-09-22}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/11/world/americas/cuba-rationing-sanctions.html|title=Cuba Rations Staple Foods and Soap in Face of Economic Crisis|last=Press|first=The Associated|date=2019-05-11|work=The New York Times|access-date=2019-09-22|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref>\n\n[[File:U.S. gas rationing stamps 1974.jpg|thumb|right|United States gasoline ration stamps printed, but not used, as a result of the [[1973 oil crisis]].]]\nShort-term rationing for gas and other fuels was introduced in the [[U.S.]] states of [[New Jersey]] and [[New York (state)|New York]] following [[Hurricane Sandy]] in 2012.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/19/nyregion/new-york-to-extend-gas-rationing-through-friday.html|title=New York City Decides to Extend Gas Rationing Through Friday|last=Hu|first=Winnie|date=2012-11-18|work=The New York Times|access-date=2019-09-22|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref>\n\nIn April of 2019, [[Venezuela]] announced a 30-day electricity rationing regime in the face of power shortages.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.scmp.com/news/world/americas/article/3004084/venezuela-president-nicolas-maduro-announces-electricity|title=Venezuela\u2019s Maduro announces electricity rationing amid power cuts|date=2019-04-01|website=South China Morning Post|language=en|access-date=2019-09-22}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.business-standard.com/article/news-ians/electricity-rationing-plan-announced-in-venezuela-119040100192_1.html|title=Electricity rationing plan announced in Venezuela|last=IANS|date=2019-04-01|work=Business Standard India|access-date=2019-09-22}}</ref>\n\nFrom 2015 to 2019, the US state of [[California]] gradually introduced permanent rationing on the use of water by limiting the daily household water expenditure.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://californiaglobe.com/fr/californians-face-residential-water-rationing-next-year-following-record-snowpack/|title=Californians Face Residential Water Rationing Next Year Following Record 2019 Snowpack|date=2019-05-08|website=California Globe|language=en-US|access-date=2019-09-22}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.hoover.org/research/permanent-water-rationing-way-californians-pray-rain|title=With Permanent Water Rationing On The Way, Californians Pray For Rain|website=Hoover Institution|language=en|access-date=2019-09-22}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/02/us/california-imposes-first-ever-water-restrictions-to-deal-with-drought.html|title=California Imposes First Mandatory Water Restrictions to Deal With Drought|last=Nagourney|first=Adam|date=2015-04-01|work=The New York Times|access-date=2019-09-22|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref>\n\n===Refugee aid rations===\n{{See also|Refugee camp#Food rations}}\nAid agencies, such as the [[World Food Programme]], provide fortnightly food rations and other essentials to [[refugees]] or [[internally displaced person]]s who are registered with the [[UNHCR]] and are either living in [[refugee camps]] or are supported in [[Urban refugee|urban centres]].

In places where the government provides healthcare rationing is explicit. In other places people are denied treatment because of personal lack of funds, or because of decisions made by insurance companies.  The American Supreme Court approved paying doctors to ration care, saying that there must be \"some incentive connecting physician reward with treatment rationing\".<ref>{{cite news|title=The Nation: The 'R' Word; Justice Souter Takes on a Health Care Taboo|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2000/06/18/weekinreview/the-nation-the-r-word-justice-souter-takes-on-a-health-care-taboo.html|accessdate=19 May 2015|publisher=New York Times|date=18 June 2000}}</ref>   Shortages of organs for donation forces the rationing of organs for transplant even where funding is available.\n\nSee also [[Healthcare rationing in the United States]]\n\n===Credit rationing===\n{{main|Credit rationing}}\nThe concept in [[economics]] and [[banking]] of '''credit rationing''' describes the situation when a bank limits the [[supply (economics)|supply]] of loans, although it has enough funds to loan out, and the supply of loans has not yet equalled the [[demand]] of prospective borrowers. Changing the price of the loans (interest rate) does not equilibrate the demand and supply of the loans.\n\n===Carbon rationing===\n{{Main|Carbon rationing}}\n'''Personal carbon trading''' refers to proposed [[emissions trading]] schemes under which emissions credits are allocated to adult individuals on a (broadly) equal [[per capita]] basis, within national [[United Kingdom Climate Change Bill|carbon budgets]]. Individuals then surrender these credits when buying fuel or electricity. Individuals wanting or needing to emit at a level above that permitted by their initial allocation would be able to engage in emissions trading and purchase additional credits. Conversely, those individuals who emit at a level below that permitted by their initial allocation have the opportunity to sell their surplus credits. Thus, individual trading under Personal Carbon Trading is similar to the trading of companies under [[EU ETS]].\n\nPersonal carbon trading is sometimes confused with [[carbon offset]]ting due to the similar notion of paying for emissions allowances, but is a quite different concept designed to be mandatory and to guarantee that nations achieve their domestic carbon emissions targets (rather than attempting to do so via international trading or offsetting).\n\n==Rationing mechanisms==\nThe purpose of rationing is to guarantee a minimum of some resource or to impose a maximum to its use. (The latter is the case with carbon rationing, where the scarcity is artificial.) Usually, government determines a fair ration, for example, one proportional to the number of family members. At other times, the ration can only be estimated by the\nbeneficiary, like a factory for which energy is to be rationed. \n\nIn such cases, a mechanism is needed to discourage misreporting the needs or wants (strategy-proofness). Suppose every participant reports an ideal ration. For so-called uniform rationing, each ration is set to the minimum of the participant's ideal ration and a cap, the cap being determined so that the sum of the rations equals the amount available. So, loosely speaking, the participant asking least will be served first. This mechanism is strategy-proof, avoids unnecessary waste (Pareto optimality) and equally treats equals (anonimity). In fact, it is the only such mechanism.<ref>{{Cite journal|title=Sprumont's characterization of the uniform rule when all single-peaked preferences are admissible|journal=Review of Economic Design|last=Weymark|first=John A.|date=|volume=4|pages=389-393|issue=4|others=(January 2000)}}</ref> (Anonimity in this statement can be replaced by envyfreeness.)\n\nIf the available amount is collected from multiple participants (the suppliers) and redistributed among the demanders along certain links (bipartite rationing) then a similar mechanism is the so-called egalitarian transfer.<ref>{{Cite journal|title=Groupstrategyproofness of the egalitarian mechanism for constrained rationing problems|journal=Mathematical Social Sciences|last=Chandramouli|first=Shyam|volume=90|pages=111-118|last2=Sethuraman|first2=Jay|others=(November 2017)|publication-date=}}</ref> This is further generalised to the uniform gains rule, which is based on a so-called leximin ordering.<ref>{{Cite journal|title=One-dimensional mechanism design|journal=Theoretical Economics|last=Moulin|first=Herv\u00e9|volume=12|pages=587\u2013619|year=2017}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{div col|colwidth=22em}}\n* [[Austerity in Israel]]\n* [[Basic income]]\n* [[Food bank]]\n* [[Ration stamp|Food stamps]]\n* [[Grain rationing in China]]\n* [[2007 Gas Rationing Plan in Iran]]\n* [[Juntas de Abastecimientos y Precios]], rationing in&nbsp;[[Chile under Allende]]\n* [[Military rations]]\n* [[Rationing in Cuba]]\n* [[Rationing in Nicaragua]]\n* [[Rationing in the Soviet Union]]\n* [[Rationing in the United States]]\n* [[Road space rationing]]\n* [[Salt lists]]\n* [[Siege of Leningrad]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==References==\n\n===Notes===\n{{Reflist}}\n\n===Bibliography===\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20110927194310/http://www.health.state.ny.us/diseases/communicable/influenza/pandemic/ventilators/docs/ventilator_guidance.pdf Allocation of Ventilators in an Influenza Pandemic], Report of New York State Task Force on Life and the Law, 2007.\n* Matt Gouras. \"Frist Defends Flu Shots for Congress.\" ''Associated Press''.

Rationing controls the size of the '''ration''', which is one's allowed portion of the resources being distributed on a particular day or at a particular time. There are many forms of rationing,\nand in western civilization people experience some of them in daily life without realizing it.<ref>Cox, Stan (2013). [https://thenewpress.com/books/any-way-you-slice-it \"Any way you slice it: The past, present and future of rationing\"]. New Press Books.</ref>\n\nRationing is often done to keep price below the equilibrium ([[market clearing|market-clearing]]) price determined by the process of [[supply and demand]] in an [[free market|unfettered market]]. Thus, rationing can be complementary to [[incomes policies|price controls]]. An example of rationing in the face of rising prices took place in the various countries where there was rationing of gasoline during the [[1973 energy crisis]].\n\nA reason for setting the price lower than would clear the market may be that there is a shortage, which would drive the market price very high. High prices, especially in the case of necessities, are undesirable with regard to those who cannot afford them. Traditionalist economists argue, however, that high prices act to reduce waste of the scarce resource while also providing incentive to produce more.\n\nRationing using [[ration stamp]]s is only one kind of non-price rationing. For example, [[scarcity|scarce]] products can be rationed using queues. This is seen, for example, at [[amusement park]]s, where one pays a price to get in and then need not pay any price to go on the rides. Similarly, in the absence of [[road pricing]], access to roads is rationed in a [[first come, first served]] [[queueing]] process, leading to [[traffic congestion|congestion]].\n\nAuthorities which introduce rationing often have to deal with the rationed goods being sold illegally on the [[black market]]. Despite the fact that rationing systems are sometimes necessary as the only viable option for societies facing severe consumer goods shortages, they are usually extremely unpopular with the general public, as they enforce limits on individual consumption.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://sos.oregon.gov/archives/exhibits/ww2/Pages/services-rationing.aspx|title=Oregon Secretary of State: Rationing: A Necessary But Hated Sacrifice|website=sos.oregon.gov|access-date=2019-09-22}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://museumcrush.org/how-the-ministry-of-food-managed-food-rationing-in-world-war-two/|title=How the Ministry of Food managed food rationing in World War Two \u2013 Museum Crush|website=museumcrush.org|access-date=2019-09-22}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/dec/24/food-rationing-crises-public-health-problem-obesity-hunger-big-government|title=Could rationing hold the key to today's food crises? {{!}} Zoe Williams|last=Williams|first=Zoe|date=2013-12-24|work=The Guardian|access-date=2019-09-22|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}</ref>\n\n==Civilian rationing==\nRationing has been instituted during wartime for civilians. For example, each person may be given what's known as a \u201cration coupon\u201d allowing him or her to purchase a certain amount of a product each month. Rationing often includes [[food]] and other necessities for which there is a shortage, including materials needed for the war effort such as [[rubber]] [[tire]]s, [[leather]] [[shoe]]s, [[clothing]] and [[fuel]].\n\nRationing of food and water may also become necessary during an emergency, such as a [[natural disaster]] or [[Terrorism|terror attack]]. In the U.S., the [[Federal Emergency Management Agency]] (FEMA) has established guidelines for civilians on rationing food and water supplies when replacements are not available. According to FEMA standards, every person should have a minimum of {{convert|1|USqt|litre}} per day of water, and more for children, nursing mothers and the ill.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fema.gov/pdf/library/f&web.pdf|publisher=FEMA|title=Food and Water in an Emergency}}</ref>\n\n===Origins===\n[[File:Lebensmittel Karikatur, item 1.jpg|thumb|right|[[First World War]] German government propaganda poster describing rationing with personifications of meat, bread, sugar, butter, milk and meal (1916)]]\nMilitary [[siege]]s have often resulted in shortages of food and other essential consumables.

They worked on the chemical composition of the human body, and on the nutritional value of different flours used to make bread. Widdowson also studied the impact of infant diet on human growth. They studied the differing effects from deficiencies of salt and of water and produced the first tables to compare the different nutritional content of foods before and after cooking. They co-authored ''The Chemical Composition of Foods'', first published in 1940 by the [[Medical Research Council (UK)|Medical Research Council]].

In particular, daily bread rations in [[Siege of Leningrad|sieged Leningrad]] were initially set at 800 grams. By the end of 1941 the bread rations were reduced to 250 grams for workers and 125 for everyone else, which resulted in [[Effect of the Siege of Leningrad on the city#Food shortages|surge of deaths]] caused by starvation. Starting from 1942 daily bread rations were increased to 350 grams for workers and 200 grams for everyone else. One of the documents of the period is the diary of [[Tanya Savicheva]], who recorded the deaths of each member of her family during the siege.\n\nRationing was also introduced to a number of British dominions, and colonies, with rationing of clothing imposed in Australia, from 12 June 1942, and certain foodstuffs from 1943. Canada rationed tea, coffee, sugar, butter and mechanical spares, between 1942 and 1947. Cochin, Travancore and Madras states, of British India, elected to ration grain between the fall of 1943, and Spring 1944. While Egypt introduced a ration card based subsidy, of essential foodstuffs, in 1945, that's persisted into the 21st century.\n\n===Peacetime rationing===\n[[File:Kartka na mleko.jpg|thumb|right|Polish milk ration stamp from 1981\u20131983.]]\nCivilian peacetime rationing of food has also occurred in history, especially after natural disasters, during contingencies, or after failed governmental economic policies regarding production or distribution, as well as due to extensive [[austerity]] programs implemented to cut or restrict public spending in countries where the rationed goods previously relied on government procurement or subsidies, as was the case [[Austerity in Israel|in Israel]] and [[Austerity in Romania|Romania]].\n\nIn the [[United Kingdom]], the rationing system remained in place for many years after the end of the [[Second World War|War]]. In some respects it was more strict after the war than during it\u2014two major foodstuffs that were never rationed during the war, bread and potatoes, went on ration after it (bread from 1946 to 1948, and potatoes for a time from 1947). Tea was still on ration until 1952. In 1953 rationing of sugar and eggs ended, and in 1954, all rationing finally ended when cheese and meats came off ration.<ref name=\"suckingeggs\"/> Sugar was again rationed in 1974 after Caribbean producers began selling to the more lucrative United States market.<ref>{{cite news|title=Rationing starts as sugar shortage looms|publisher=The Guardian|page=3|date=9 July 1974}}</ref>\n\nSome centralized [[planned economies]] introduced a peacetime rationing system due to food shortages in the postwar period.

At first, only staple foods such as [[oil]], [[sugar]], and [[margarine]] were rationed, but it was later expanded, and eventually included [[furniture]] and [[footwear]]. Every month, each citizen would get food coupons worth 6 [[Israeli pound]]s, and every family would be allotted a given amount of food. The average Israeli diet was 2,800 calories a day, with additional calories for children, the elderly, and pregnant women.\n\nFollowing the 1952 [[Reparations Agreement between Israel and West Germany|reparations agreement]] with West Germany, and the subsequent influx of foreign capital, Israel's struggling economy was bolstered, and in 1953, most restrictions were cancelled. In 1958, the list of rationed goods was narrowed to just eleven, and in 1959, it was narrowed to only [[jam]], sugar, and [[coffee]].\n[[File:No gas 1974.gif|alt=A man at a service station reads about the U.S. gasoline rationing system in an afternoon newspaper; a sign in the background states that no gasoline is available. 1974|thumb|A man at a service station reads about the U.S. gasoline rationing system in an afternoon newspaper; a sign in the background states that no gasoline is available. 1974]]\nPetroleum products were rationed in many countries following the [[1973 oil crisis]].

Rationing started being phased out in the year 2000 at the end of the \"special period\", as Cuba had shifted to a more diversified and self-sustaining economy. Rationing, however, was not fully abolished and instead turned into an alternative way to purchase goods, in addition to the markets. This makes a curious departure from classical rationing, as during the 2001-2019 period, the rationing system was used in addition to, instead of as a replacement for regular markets. Cubans would be able to buy a certain amount of items at 'liberated' prices using ration coupons at a significantly reduced rate, while still being able to purchase more at regular market prices. This 'liberated' system persisted even during Cuba's period of economic growth and relative prosperity during the early and mid 2010s and enjoyed considerable popularity among the island's citizens. Cuba later re-introduced a classical limiting rationing system in 2019, following the imposition of strict sanctions on the island by US President [[Donald Trump]], as well as the collapse of oil shipments from [[Venezuela]], which was facing its own economic troubles at that time. Cuba's president pitched the new system as significantly more lenient than the 1991-2000 \"special period\", though admitted that it would negatively affect consumption.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Garth|first=Hanna|title=THINGS BECAME SCARCE: FOOD AVAILABILITY AND ACCESSIBILITY IN SANTIAGO de CUBA THEN AND NOW|url=https://www.academia.edu/965534/THINGS_BECAME_SCARCE_FOOD_AVAILABILITY_AND_ACCESSIBILITY_IN_SANTIAGO_de_CUBA_THEN_AND_NOW|journal=NAPA Bulletin|language=en|volume=32|issue=1|pages=178\u2013192|issn=1556-4789}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://archive.boston.com/news/world/latinamerica/articles/2009/11/07/cuba_cuts_back_on_rationed_products/|title=Cuba cuts back on rationed products|last=Haven|first=Paul|date=2009-11-07|work=Boston.com|access-date=2019-09-22}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.dw.com/en/cuba-to-widen-food-rationing-as-supply-crisis-bites/a-48695569|title=Cuba to widen food rationing as supply crisis bites {{!}} DW {{!}} 11.05.2019|last=Welle (www.dw.com)|first=Deutsche|website=DW.COM|language=en-GB|access-date=2019-09-22}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/11/world/americas/cuba-rationing-sanctions.html|title=Cuba Rations Staple Foods and Soap in Face of Economic Crisis|last=Press|first=The Associated|date=2019-05-11|work=The New York Times|access-date=2019-09-22|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref>\n\n[[File:U.S. gas rationing stamps 1974.jpg|thumb|right|United States gasoline ration stamps printed, but not used, as a result of the [[1973 oil crisis]].]]\nShort-term rationing for gas and other fuels was introduced in the [[U.S.]] states of [[New Jersey]] and [[New York (state)|New York]] following [[Hurricane Sandy]] in 2012.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/19/nyregion/new-york-to-extend-gas-rationing-through-friday.html|title=New York City Decides to Extend Gas Rationing Through Friday|last=Hu|first=Winnie|date=2012-11-18|work=The New York Times|access-date=2019-09-22|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref>\n\nIn April of 2019, [[Venezuela]] announced a 30-day electricity rationing regime in the face of power shortages.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.scmp.com/news/world/americas/article/3004084/venezuela-president-nicolas-maduro-announces-electricity|title=Venezuela\u2019s Maduro announces electricity rationing amid power cuts|date=2019-04-01|website=South China Morning Post|language=en|access-date=2019-09-22}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.business-standard.com/article/news-ians/electricity-rationing-plan-announced-in-venezuela-119040100192_1.html|title=Electricity rationing plan announced in Venezuela|last=IANS|date=2019-04-01|work=Business Standard India|access-date=2019-09-22}}</ref>\n\nFrom 2015 to 2019, the US state of [[California]] gradually introduced permanent rationing on the use of water by limiting the daily household water expenditure.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://californiaglobe.com/fr/californians-face-residential-water-rationing-next-year-following-record-snowpack/|title=Californians Face Residential Water Rationing Next Year Following Record 2019 Snowpack|date=2019-05-08|website=California Globe|language=en-US|access-date=2019-09-22}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.hoover.org/research/permanent-water-rationing-way-californians-pray-rain|title=With Permanent Water Rationing On The Way, Californians Pray For Rain|website=Hoover Institution|language=en|access-date=2019-09-22}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/02/us/california-imposes-first-ever-water-restrictions-to-deal-with-drought.html|title=California Imposes First Mandatory Water Restrictions to Deal With Drought|last=Nagourney|first=Adam|date=2015-04-01|work=The New York Times|access-date=2019-09-22|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref>\n\n===Refugee aid rations===\n{{See also|Refugee camp#Food rations}}\nAid agencies, such as the [[World Food Programme]], provide fortnightly food rations and other essentials to [[refugees]] or [[internally displaced person]]s who are registered with the [[UNHCR]] and are either living in [[refugee camps]] or are supported in [[Urban refugee|urban centres]].

In places where the government provides healthcare rationing is explicit. In other places people are denied treatment because of personal lack of funds, or because of decisions made by insurance companies.  The American Supreme Court approved paying doctors to ration care, saying that there must be \"some incentive connecting physician reward with treatment rationing\".<ref>{{cite news|title=The Nation: The 'R' Word; Justice Souter Takes on a Health Care Taboo|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2000/06/18/weekinreview/the-nation-the-r-word-justice-souter-takes-on-a-health-care-taboo.html|accessdate=19 May 2015|publisher=New York Times|date=18 June 2000}}</ref>   Shortages of organs for donation forces the rationing of organs for transplant even where funding is available.\n\nSee also [[Healthcare rationing in the United States]]\n\n===Credit rationing===\n{{main|Credit rationing}}\nThe concept in [[economics]] and [[banking]] of '''credit rationing''' describes the situation when a bank limits the [[supply (economics)|supply]] of loans, although it has enough funds to loan out, and the supply of loans has not yet equalled the [[demand]] of prospective borrowers. Changing the price of the loans (interest rate) does not equilibrate the demand and supply of the loans.\n\n===Carbon rationing===\n{{Main|Carbon rationing}}\n'''Personal carbon trading''' refers to proposed [[emissions trading]] schemes under which emissions credits are allocated to adult individuals on a (broadly) equal [[per capita]] basis, within national [[United Kingdom Climate Change Bill|carbon budgets]]. Individuals then surrender these credits when buying fuel or electricity. Individuals wanting or needing to emit at a level above that permitted by their initial allocation would be able to engage in emissions trading and purchase additional credits. Conversely, those individuals who emit at a level below that permitted by their initial allocation have the opportunity to sell their surplus credits. Thus, individual trading under Personal Carbon Trading is similar to the trading of companies under [[EU ETS]].\n\nPersonal carbon trading is sometimes confused with [[carbon offset]]ting due to the similar notion of paying for emissions allowances, but is a quite different concept designed to be mandatory and to guarantee that nations achieve their domestic carbon emissions targets (rather than attempting to do so via international trading or offsetting).\n\n==Rationing mechanisms==\nThe purpose of rationing is to guarantee a minimum of some resource or to impose a maximum to its use. (The latter is the case with carbon rationing, where the scarcity is artificial.) Usually, government determines a fair ration, for example, one proportional to the number of family members. At other times, the ration can only be estimated by the\nbeneficiary, like a factory for which energy is to be rationed. \n\nIn such cases, a mechanism is needed to discourage misreporting the needs or wants (strategy-proofness). Suppose every participant reports an ideal ration. For so-called uniform rationing, each ration is set to the minimum of the participant's ideal ration and a cap, the cap being determined so that the sum of the rations equals the amount available. So, loosely speaking, the participant asking least will be served first. This mechanism is strategy-proof, avoids unnecessary waste (Pareto optimality) and equally treats equals (anonimity). In fact, it is the only such mechanism.<ref>{{Cite journal|title=Sprumont's characterization of the uniform rule when all single-peaked preferences are admissible|journal=Review of Economic Design|last=Weymark|first=John A.|date=|volume=4|pages=389-393|issue=4|others=(January 2000)}}</ref> (Anonimity in this statement can be replaced by envyfreeness.)\n\nIf the available amount is collected from multiple participants (the suppliers) and redistributed among the demanders along certain links (bipartite rationing) then a similar mechanism is the so-called egalitarian transfer.<ref>{{Cite journal|title=Groupstrategyproofness of the egalitarian mechanism for constrained rationing problems|journal=Mathematical Social Sciences|last=Chandramouli|first=Shyam|volume=90|pages=111-118|last2=Sethuraman|first2=Jay|others=(November 2017)|publication-date=}}</ref> This is further generalised to the uniform gains rule, which is based on a so-called leximin ordering.<ref>{{Cite journal|title=One-dimensional mechanism design|journal=Theoretical Economics|last=Moulin|first=Herv\u00e9|volume=12|pages=587\u2013619|year=2017}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{div col|colwidth=22em}}\n* [[Austerity in Israel]]\n* [[Food bank]]\n* [[Ration stamp|Food stamps]]\n* [[Grain rationing in China]]\n* [[2007 Gas Rationing Plan in Iran]]\n* [[Juntas de Abastecimientos y Precios]], rationing in&nbsp;[[Chile under Allende]]\n* [[Military rations]]\n* [[Rationing in Cuba]]\n* [[Rationing in Nicaragua]]\n* [[Rationing in the Soviet Union]]\n* [[Rationing in the United States]]\n* [[Road space rationing]]\n* [[Salt lists]]\n* [[Siege of Leningrad]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==References==\n\n===Notes===\n{{Reflist}}\n\n===Bibliography===\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20110927194310/http://www.health.state.ny.us/diseases/communicable/influenza/pandemic/ventilators/docs/ventilator_guidance.pdf Allocation of Ventilators in an Influenza Pandemic], Report of New York State Task Force on Life and the Law, 2007.\n* Matt Gouras. \"Frist Defends Flu Shots for Congress.\" ''Associated Press''.

The album notably contains the very first officially-released recording by [[Bob Dylan]], who plays harmonica on the title track. For many years the Belafonte session was thought to have been Bob Dylan\u2019s first professional recording, simply because this RCA Victor album was released first. However, documentation found in 2001 in the RCA vaults along with the tapes dates the session definitively as having been recorded at Webster Hall, New York City, in February 1962. This places it later than Bob's recording session with folksinger [[Carolyn Hester]], which dates from September 1961, also in New York City, although her album was not released until later in 1962.\n\n== Track listing ==\n#\"Midnight Special\" \u2013 3:55\n#\"Crawdad Song\" \u2013 3:32\n#\"Memphis Tennessee\" \u2013 4:53\n#\"Gotta Travel On\" \u2013 4:20\n#\"Did You Hear About Jerry?\" \u2013 2:52\n#\"On Top of Old Smokey\" \u2013 5:54\n#\"Muleskinner\" \u2013 3:26\n#\"Makes a Long Time Man Feel Bad\" \u2013 5:40\n#\"[[Michael Row the Boat Ashore]]\" (Traditional) \u2013 3:54\n\n== Critical reception ==\n[http://www.pigriver.com/harry-belafonte-the-midnight-special/ Pig River Records] praised [http://www.pigriver.com/harry-belafonte-the-midnight-special/ \"The Midnight Special\"] on its 50th anniversary giving it 8.1/10.\n\n==Personnel==\n*[[Harry Belafonte]] \u2013 vocals\n*Ernie Calabria \u2013 guitar\n*Millard Thomas \u2013 guitar\n*Norman Keenan \u2013 bass\n*[[Percy Brice]] \u2013 drums\n*Danny Barrajanos \u2013 drums\n*[[Don Lamond]] \u2013 drums\n*Joe Wilder \u2013 trumpet solo\n*[[Jerome Richardson]] \u2013 saxophone\n*[[Bob Dylan]] \u2013 harmonica on track 1\n'''Production notes:'''\n*[[Hugo Montenegro]] \u2013 producer\n*Conducted and arranged by Jimmy Jones\n*Bob Simpson \u2013 engineer, mastering\n*Peter Perri \u2013 cover photo\n*Bob Bollard \u2013 liner notes\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Harry Belafonte}}\n\n[[Category:1962 albums]]\n[[Category:Harry Belafonte albums]]\n[[Category:RCA Victor albums]]\n[[Category:Albums produced by Hugo Montenegro]]\n[[Category:Albums conducted by Jimmy Jones (pianist)]]\n[[Category:Albums arranged by Jimmy Jones (pianist)]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox album\n| name       = The Midnight Special\n| type       = [[Album]]\n| artist     = [[Harry Belafonte]]\n| cover      = Midnight Special.jpg\n| alt        =\n| released   = 1962\n| recorded   =\n| venue      =\n| studio     =\n| genre      = [[Vocal]]\n| length     =\n| label      = [[RCA Victor]] LSP2449\n| producer   = [[Hugo Montenegro]]\n| prev_title = [[Jump Up Calypso]]\n| prev_year  = 1961\n| next_title = [[The Many Moods of Belafonte (album)|The Many Moods of Belafonte]]\n| next_year  = 1962\n}}\n{{Album ratings\n| rev1      = [[Allmusic]]\n| rev1Score ={{Rating|4|5}} <ref name=\"AM\">[{{Allmusic|class=album|id= r24512/review|pure_url=yes}} Allmusic review] </ref>\n| noprose=yes\n|}}\n'''''The Midnight Special''''' is a 1962 album by [[Jamaica]]n-[[United States|American]] singer, [[Harry Belafonte]].
