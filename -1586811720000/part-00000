To date, she has participated in 12 deep water dives in the deep-ocean submersible ''[[DSV Alvin|Alvin]]''.  She researched the volcano-tectonic processes responsible for creating new oceanic crust at [[Mid-ocean ridge|seafloor spreading centers]].  In 1968, she co-authored a research paper featuring groundbreaking work into the faulted nature of spreading centers.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Menard |first1=H.W. |last2=Atwater |first2= T.M. | year=1968 |title=Changes in direction of sea floor spreading| journal=Nature| volume=219|issue=5153 | pages=463\u2013467|bibcode=1968Natur.219..463M|doi=10.1038/219463a0}}</ref> With [[Jack Corliss]], [[Fred Spiess]], and [[Kenneth C.

This helped to explain the complex pattern of the seafloor.\n\nAtwater is perhaps best known for her work on the [[plate tectonic]] history of western North America.  She wrote two major research papers outlining the history of plate tectonic evolution of North America and tectonic problems of the [[San Andreas Fault]], which assisted in documenting the history of the [[San Andreas Fault Line]].<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Atwater |first1=Tanya |last2=Molnar |first2=Peter | year=1973 |title=Relative motion of the Pacific and North American plates deduced from sea-floor spreading in the Atlantic, Indian and South Pacific Oceans| publisher=R.

In her work, she explains that approximately 40 million years ago, the [[Farallon Plate]] was subducting underneath the [[North American Plate]] and the [[Pacific Plate]].  The lower half of the Farallon plate was entirely subducted under Southern California and the upper half did not sink, which eventually became known as the [[Juan de Fuca Plate]].Since the southern section of Farallon completely disappeared, the boundary of southern California was now between the Pacific Plate and the North American Plate. The [[San Andreas Fault]] is unique because it acts as a major fault line as well as a border between the [[Pacific Plate]] and the [[North American Plate]].<ref name=\"GeoScienceWorld\"/> She updated this work in 1989.<ref>Atwater, T.

She is particularly renowned for her early research on the [[plate tectonic]] history of western North America.\n\n==Early life and education==\nAtwater was born in [[Los Angeles]], [[California]] on August 27, 1942.<ref name=PSU>{{cite web |url=https://www.e-education.psu.edu/earth520/book/export/html/1752 |title=Tanya Atwater |publisher=John A.

Atwater was one of the first women to research the ocean floor in terms of its [[Geology]].{{sfn|Atwater|2017}}\n\nAtwater began her education in 1960 at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]], then received her B.A. in Geophysics from the [[University of California, Berkeley]] in 1965.<ref>{{citation|last=Gates|first=Alexander E.|chapter=\"Atwater, Tanya\" |title=A to Z of earth scientists|year=2003|publisher=Facts on File|location=New York|isbn=978-0816045808 |pages=10\u201312}}</ref> She earned a Ph.D. (1972) in [[marine geophysics]] from [[Scripps Institution of Oceanography]], [[University of California, San Diego]]. She is director of the [[University of California, Santa Barbara]] Educational Multimedia Visualization Center where she is an emerita professor of geological sciences. She was a professor at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] before joining the faculty at UCSB in 1980. Atwater retired from UCSB in 2007.<ref>{{cite web|title=EMVC Web Page|url=http://emvc.geol.ucsb.edu}}</ref>\n\n==Career==\nAtwater was a professor of [[tectonics]], in the Department of Geological Sciences at the [[University of California, Santa Barbara]] before retiring. She authored and co-authored 50 articles in international journals, professional volumes, and major reports. Seven of these papers were published in the journals ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' or ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]''. In 1975, she became a fellow of the [[American Geophysical Union]] for her work in [[tectonophysics]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Tanya M.

To date, she has participated in 12 deep water dives in the deep-ocean submersible ''[[DSV Alvin|Alvin]]''.  She researched the volcano-tectonic processes responsible for creating new oceanic crust at [[Mid-ocean ridge|seafloor spreading centers]].  In 1968, she co-authored a research paper featuring groundbreaking work into the faulted nature of spreading centers.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Menard |first1=H.W. |last2=Atwater |first2= T.M. | year=1968 |title=Changes in direction of sea floor spreading| journal=Nature| volume=219|issue=5153 | pages=463\u2013467|bibcode=1968Natur.219..463M|doi=10.1038/219463a0}}</ref> With [[Jack Corliss]], [[Fred Spiess]], and [[Kenneth C. Macdonald|Kenneth Macdonald]], she played key roles in expeditions that uncovered the distinct biology of ocean floor warm springs, which led to the discovery during the [[RISE project]] of the high temperature black smokers, undersea [[hydrothermal vent]]s.\n\nIn Atwater's research on [[Propagating Rifts]] near the [[Gal\u00e1pagos Islands|Galapagos Islands]],<ref>{{cite journal|last=Atwater |first=Tanya | year=1981 |title=Propagating rifts in seafloor spreading patterns| journal=Nature| volume=290|issue=5803 | pages=185\u2013186|bibcode=1981Natur.290..185A|doi=10.1038/290185a0}}</ref> she discovered that propagating rifts were created when spreading centers along the seafloor were disturbed by tectonic movement or [[magma]] and therefore had to change direction to realign. This helped to explain the complex pattern of the seafloor.\n\nAtwater is perhaps best known for her work on the [[plate tectonic]] history of western North America.  She wrote two major research papers outlining the history of plate tectonic evolution of North America and tectonic problems of the [[San Andreas Fault]], which assisted in documenting the history of the [[San Andreas Fault Line]].<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Atwater |first1=Tanya |last2=Molnar |first2=Peter | year=1973 |title=Relative motion of the Pacific and North American plates deduced from sea-floor spreading in the Atlantic, Indian and South Pacific Oceans| publisher=R.

Nur, eds., Proc. of the Conf. on Tectonic Problems of the San Andreas Fault: Stanford University Publication| volume=13 | pages=136\u2013148}}</ref>\n\nShe also studied geometric evolution, integrating and comparing the global plate motion records with the regional continental geologic records.  She found emerging relationships that revealed the origins of many large-scale geologic features (e.g. [[Rocky Mountains]], [[Yellowstone National Park|Yellowstone]], [[Death Valley]], [[Cascade Volcanoes|Cascade]] volcanoes, [[California Coast Ranges]]).<ref name=\"foo\"/>\n\nAtwater published a research paper, Implications of Plate [[Tectonics]] for the Cenozoic Tectonic Evolution of Western North America.<ref name=\"GeoScienceWorld\">{{cite journal|last1=Atwater |first1=Tanya | year=1970 |title=Implications of Plate Tectonics for the Cenozoic Tectonic Evolution of Western North America|journal=Geological Society of America Bulletin | volume=81 | issue=12 | pages=3513\u20133536|bibcode=1970GSAB...81.3513A |doi=10.1130/0016-7606(1970)81[3513:IOPTFT]2.0.CO;2 }}</ref>  In her work, she explains that approximately 40 million years ago, the [[Farallon Plate]] was subducting underneath the [[North American Plate]] and the [[Pacific Plate]].  The lower half of the Farallon plate was entirely subducted under Southern California and the upper half did not sink, which eventually became known as the [[Juan de Fuca Plate]].Since the southern section of Farallon completely disappeared, the boundary of southern California was now between the Pacific Plate and the North American Plate. The [[San Andreas Fault]] is unique because it acts as a major fault line as well as a border between the [[Pacific Plate]] and the [[North American Plate]].<ref name=\"GeoScienceWorld\"/> She updated this work in 1989.<ref>Atwater, T.

There are 8 officers on the Board. For details on the Board's clubs, see [[:Category:Gaelic Athletic Association clubs in County Cavan|Gaelic Athletic Association clubs in County Cavan]] and [[List of Gaelic games clubs in Ireland#Cavan]].\nThe Board is subject to the [[Ulster GAA]] Provincial Council.\n{{Cavan GAA clubs|state=collapsed}}\nThe teams of Cavan GAA play home games at [[Kingspan Breffni Park]], [[Cavan]]. The current football manager is Mickey Graham, who took over following the resignation of Mattie McGleenan in 2018.\n\n===Sponsorship===\nThe following is a list of sponsors of the Cavan Senior Football team\n* 1992: Holybrook Construction\n* 1993: Atlanta Conservatories\n* 1994: Cavan Co-op Mart \n* 1995 \u2013 present: [[Kingspan Group]]\nCavan have had only 4 sponsorship deals since sponsors on jerseys were permitted by the GAA in 1991. There was no sponsorship on GAA jerseys until the 2nd game of the Meath V Dublin 4 in a row in 1991 so only a handful of teams had sponsorship in 1991. In 1992 Holybrook Construction sponsored the jerseys although it was only for 1 game. For the 1993-94 seasons Cavan Co-op Mart took over sponsorship. Kingspan has continuously sponsored Cavan since 1995.\n\n===Crest and symbols===\n[[File:Cavan Coat of Arms.png|left|thumb|100px|Coat of Arms of County Cavan]]\nThe first crest that adorned the Cavan jerseys was the Coat of Arms for [[County Cavan]]. The crest was split into four quadrants and included\n* the red hand of Ulster encased in an outline of the Franciscan Abbey which is situated in Cavan town and where the O'Reilly chieftains are buried. Here also lies the remains of an Ulster leader, Eoghan Rua O'Neill. \n*The Rampant Lion from the coat of arms of the O\u2019Reilly clans, who were the local lords.\nIn 2004 Cavan released a new crest for the Breifne County. The crest was designed by the [[List of Presidents of the Gaelic Athletic Association|38th President]] of the [[Gaelic Athletic Association]] Aog\u00e1n Farrell and Cavan Central Council rep. George Cartwright. The crest draws on cultural, physical and historical influences. The primary colours are blue and white with Ulster's red hand and G.A.A. yellow also prominent. The designers wanted to reflect the following elements\n*Breifne: The ancient Gaelic territory. Modern Cavan was once \"O Reilly country\" and the ancient Gaelic kingdom of Breifne is preserved in the name of the home pitch in Cavan and now on its crest\n*Franciscan Abbey: The mediaeval tower from the Abbey in Cavan Town fills the lower quadrant. Here the O' Reilly\u2019s invited the Franciscans to establish a monastery. The O'Reilly chieftains are buried here. Here also lie the remains of Ulster's great leader, Eoghan Rua O'Neill\n*GAA Logo: The GAA modern logo fills the right quadrant. The logo is representative of the [[Gaelic Athletic Association]].\n*Red Hand 1886:  The first GAA club founded in the province of Ulster was formed in Cavan. [[Ballyconnell First Ulsters GFC|Ballyconnell First Ulsters]] formed in 1885 and affiliated in 1886. The date is preserved in the crest. A red hand has always appeared on Cavan crests. \n*Lakes and Hills: Our landscape is dominated by \"wee lakes and hills\". The environment shapes us and this is reflected on the new crest.\n\n==Gaelic football==\n\n===History===\n[[File:Cavan vs Queens - 2009.jpg|left|thumb|300px|Cavan (blue) in action against [[Queen's University Belfast]] in the 2009 [[Dr. McKenna Cup]]]]\nThe first GAA club in Cavan and in Ulster was founded in [[Ballyconnell]] in late 1885 called Ballyconnell Joe Biggars in honour of west Cavan Nationalist MP Joe Biggar. The name of the club was later changed to Ballyconnell First Ulsters.\n\nThe very first Cavan County Final, under GAA rules was played in a field outside Cavan Town on 30 April 1887. The final was contested by Ballyconnell First Ulster\u2019s and Maghera MacFinns. MacFinns recorded a famous victory on a score line of 1-4 to First Ulster\u2019s 0-1, thus entering the history books as Cavan\u2019s first Champions.\n\nCavan are the most successful football county in Ulster, having won the [[All-Ireland Senior Football Championship]] 5 times, the [[Ulster Senior Football Championship]] 39 times, and the [[National Football League (Ireland)|National Football League]] once.\nCavan's first All-Ireland victory came in [[1933 All-Ireland Senior Football Championship|1933]]. They foiled [[Kerry GAA|Kerry]]'s five-in-a-row bid with a last minute goal from Vincent McGovern in the All-Ireland Semi-Final at Breffni Park 1933, and went on to beat [[Galway GAA|Galway]] by a point in [[1933 All-Ireland Senior Football Championship Final|the final]], to become the first Ulster county to win the Sam Maguire Cup. Two years later, Cavan beat [[Kildare GAA|Kildare]] in the [[1935 All-Ireland Senior Football Championship Final|1935 final]] to bring home their second title in three years.\n\nCavan's third, and most famous All-Ireland title came in [[1947 All-Ireland Senior Football Championship|1947]], defeating [[Kerry GAA|Kerry]] in the famous [[1947 All-Ireland Senior Football Championship Final|final]] in the [[Polo Grounds]] in [[New York City]], the only time the final was held outside of Ireland. They followed this up with a one-point win over [[Mayo GAA|Mayo]] in [[1948 All-Ireland Senior Football Championship|1948]], to win back-to-back titles for the first time. They reached their third successive [[1949 All-Ireland Senior Football Championship Final|final]] in [[1949 All-Ireland Senior Football Championship|1949]], but they were denied a three-in-a-row by [[Meath GAA|Meath]], losing by four points.\nCavan later gained revenge for this defeat, beating Meath after a replay in [[1952 All-Ireland Senior Football Championship Final|1952]] to bring home their fifth, and so far last, All-Ireland title. Cavan have not appeared in another All-Ireland final since.\n\nHistorically, Cavan have dominated the [[Ulster Senior Football Championship]], winning a record 39 titles. Despite this, Cavan have won only one Ulster Championship since 1969, this success coming in the [[1997 Ulster Senior Football Championship Final|1997 final]], after beating [[Derry GAA|Derry]] by a point.

The championship has never been held consistently and at times wasn\u2019t finished. Belturbet won the first [[Cavan Senior Hurling Championship]] in 1908. Hurling was revived in Cavan in 1917. Cavan Slashers were the standout Hurling team of the early period winning the championship in 1922, 1924, 1927 and 1928.  They also won 4-in-a-row between 1933 and 1936.\n\nAgain hurling died away in the county with only eight championships been finished between 1937 and 1981. Ballyhaise won successive championships in 1948 and 1949. Granard won their first championship in 1950 and [[Bailieboro Shamrocks GFC|Bailieboro Shamrocks]] and Cavan Gaels dominated the 1970s and the early 1980s. Bailieborough were victorious in 1966. Cavan Gaels won in 1973 and 1974. Bailieborough won their second championship ten years after the first in 1976 and won again in 1977.\n\n1982 saw the start of Cavan\u2019s most successful period in their Hurling history due to the influence of soldiers from hurling counties such as Kilkenny, Clare and Cork who were stationed at the border of the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland during the troubles. From 1982 to 1985 Cavan Gaels and [[Bailieboro Shamrocks GFC|Bailieboro Shamrocks]] won 2 Championships each. Bailieborough won in 1982 and 1984 and Cavan Gaels in 1983 and 1985. The County team also had success winning the [[Ulster Junior Hurling Championship]] in 1983 and 1985. In-between both Championships they won the [[National Hurling League]] Division 4 in 1984.\n\nWoodford Gaels broke the Cavan Gaels/Bailieborough dominance and won the next 3 championships 1986-1988. No championship was held in 1989 but the 1990s saw the start of the Mullahoran dominance. Mulllahoran won an amazing 21 [[Cavan Senior Hurling Championship]] between 1990 and 2010. Mullahoran\u2019s dominance was finally broken by Ballymachugh who were runners up to Mullahoran 2005, 2008 and 2009. They beat Mullahoran in 2011 on a score of 4-08 to 1-06. No championship took place in 2012 and Mullahoran won their 22nd championship in 2013 beating Cootehill Celtic 0-13 to 0-04. \n\nIn 2011 after a disastrous Division 4 league campaign where they ended with a -157 scoring difference the decision was made to discontinue the senior hurling team resulting in Cavan being the only county in Ireland without a senior hurling representative team for nearly 6 years. \n\nCavan turned out a team for the first time in six years in 2017, and played in the [[Lory Meagher Cup]] in [[2017 Lory Meagher Cup|2017]], and re-entered the [[National Hurling League]] in [[2018 National Hurling League|2018]].\n\n===Honours===\n{{main|Cavan GAA Honours}}\nCavan won the [[Ulster Junior Hurling Championship]] in 1983 and 1985.

They lost to Galway by 4-4 to 0-3 in the 1940 All Ireland semi-final, but drew with Dublin in the 1941 semi-final 4-0 to 3-3, thanks to a last-minute goal from Rita Sullivan, losing the replay 3-4 to 1-1.

In 1992 Holybrook Construction sponsored the jerseys although it was only for 1 game. For the 1993-94 seasons Cavan Co-op Mart took over sponsorship. Kingspan has continuously sponsored Cavan since 1995.\n\n===Crest and symbols===\n[[File:Cavan Coat of Arms.png|left|thumb|100px|Coat of Arms of County Cavan]]\nThe first crest that adorned the Cavan jerseys was the Coat of Arms for [[County Cavan]]. The crest was split into four quadrants and included\n* the red hand of Ulster encased in an outline of the Franciscan Abbey which is situated in Cavan town and where the O'Reilly chieftains are buried. Here also lies the remains of an Ulster leader, Eoghan Rua O'Neill. \n*The Rampant Lion from the coat of arms of the O\u2019Reilly clans, who were the local lords.\nIn 2004 Cavan released a new crest for the Breifne County. The crest was designed by the [[List of Presidents of the Gaelic Athletic Association|38th President]] of the [[Gaelic Athletic Association]] Aog\u00e1n Farrell and Cavan Central Council rep. George Cartwright. The crest draws on cultural, physical and historical influences. The primary colours are blue and white with Ulster's red hand and G.A.A. yellow also prominent. The designers wanted to reflect the following elements\n*Breifne: The ancient Gaelic territory. Modern Cavan was once \"O Reilly country\" and the ancient Gaelic kingdom of Breifne is preserved in the name of the home pitch in Cavan and now on its crest\n*Franciscan Abbey: The mediaeval tower from the Abbey in Cavan Town fills the lower quadrant. Here the O' Reilly\u2019s invited the Franciscans to establish a monastery. The O'Reilly chieftains are buried here. Here also lie the remains of Ulster's great leader, Eoghan Rua O'Neill\n*GAA Logo: The GAA modern logo fills the right quadrant. The logo is representative of the [[Gaelic Athletic Association]].\n*Red Hand 1886:  The first GAA club founded in the province of Ulster was formed in Cavan. [[Ballyconnell First Ulsters GFC|Ballyconnell First Ulsters]] formed in 1885 and affiliated in 1886. The date is preserved in the crest. A red hand has always appeared on Cavan crests. \n*Lakes and Hills: Our landscape is dominated by \"wee lakes and hills\". The environment shapes us and this is reflected on the new crest.\n\n==Gaelic football==\n\n===History===\n[[File:Cavan vs Queens - 2009.jpg|left|thumb|300px|Cavan (blue) in action against [[Queen's University Belfast]] in the 2009 [[Dr. McKenna Cup]]]]\nThe first GAA club in Cavan and in Ulster was founded in [[Ballyconnell]] in late 1885 called Ballyconnell Joe Biggars in honour of west Cavan Nationalist MP Joe Biggar. The name of the club was later changed to Ballyconnell First Ulsters.\n\nThe very first Cavan County Final, under GAA rules was played in a field outside Cavan Town on 30 April 1887. The final was contested by Ballyconnell First Ulster\u2019s and Maghera MacFinns. MacFinns recorded a famous victory on a score line of 1-4 to First Ulster\u2019s 0-1, thus entering the history books as Cavan\u2019s first Champions.\n\nCavan are the most successful football county in Ulster, having won the [[All-Ireland Senior Football Championship]] 5 times, the [[Ulster Senior Football Championship]] 39 times, and the [[National Football League (Ireland)|National Football League]] once.\nCavan's first All-Ireland victory came in [[1933 All-Ireland Senior Football Championship|1933]]. They foiled [[Kerry GAA|Kerry]]'s five-in-a-row bid with a last minute goal from Vincent McGovern in the All-Ireland Semi-Final at Breffni Park 1933, and went on to beat [[Galway GAA|Galway]] by a point in [[1933 All-Ireland Senior Football Championship Final|the final]], to become the first Ulster county to win the Sam Maguire Cup. Two years later, Cavan beat [[Kildare GAA|Kildare]] in the [[1935 All-Ireland Senior Football Championship Final|1935 final]] to bring home their second title in three years.\n\nCavan's third, and most famous All-Ireland title came in [[1947 All-Ireland Senior Football Championship|1947]], defeating [[Kerry GAA|Kerry]] in the famous [[1947 All-Ireland Senior Football Championship Final|final]] in the [[Polo Grounds]] in [[New York City]], the only time the final was held outside of Ireland. They followed this up with a one-point win over [[Mayo GAA|Mayo]] in [[1948 All-Ireland Senior Football Championship|1948]], to win back-to-back titles for the first time. They reached their third successive [[1949 All-Ireland Senior Football Championship Final|final]] in [[1949 All-Ireland Senior Football Championship|1949]], but they were denied a three-in-a-row by [[Meath GAA|Meath]], losing by four points.\nCavan later gained revenge for this defeat, beating Meath after a replay in [[1952 All-Ireland Senior Football Championship Final|1952]] to bring home their fifth, and so far last, All-Ireland title. Cavan have not appeared in another All-Ireland final since.\n\nHistorically, Cavan have dominated the [[Ulster Senior Football Championship]], winning a record 39 titles. Despite this, Cavan have won only one Ulster Championship since 1969, this success coming in [[1997_All-Ireland_Senior_Football_Championship#Ulster_Senior_Football_Championship|1997]], after upsetting [[Derry GAA|Derry]] in the final by a point.

The 2019 champions are Killinkere who beat Shannon Gaels in the decider. Templeport are the most successful junior team, having won six times.\n\n==Hurling==\n\n===History===\nTraditionally the County board has actively discouraged hurling through their policies football but Hurling has been present in the county. The championship has never been held consistently and at times wasn\u2019t finished. Belturbet won the first [[Cavan Senior Hurling Championship]] in 1908. Hurling was revived in Cavan in 1917. Cavan Slashers were the standout Hurling team of the early period winning the championship in 1922, 1924, 1927 and 1928.  They also won 4-in-a-row between 1933 and 1936.\n\nAgain hurling died away in the county with only eight championships been finished between 1937 and 1981. Ballyhaise won successive championships in 1948 and 1949. Granard won their first championship in 1950 and [[Bailieboro Shamrocks GFC|Bailieboro Shamrocks]] and Cavan Gaels dominated the 1970s and the early 1980s. Bailieborough were victorious in 1966. Cavan Gaels won in 1973 and 1974. Bailieborough won their second championship ten years after the first in 1976 and won again in 1977.\n\n1982 saw the start of Cavan\u2019s most successful period in their Hurling history due to the influence of soldiers from hurling counties such as Kilkenny, Clare and Cork who were stationed at the border of the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland during the troubles. From 1982 to 1985 Cavan Gaels and [[Bailieboro Shamrocks GFC|Bailieboro Shamrocks]] won 2 Championships each. Bailieborough won in 1982 and 1984 and Cavan Gaels in 1983 and 1985. The County team also had success winning the [[Ulster Junior Hurling Championship]] in 1983 and 1985. In-between both Championships they won the [[National Hurling League]] Division 4 in 1984.\n\nWoodford Gaels broke the Cavan Gaels/Bailieborough dominance and won the next 3 championships 1986-1988. No championship was held in 1989 but the 1990s saw the start of the Mullahoran dominance. Mulllahoran won an amazing 21 [[Cavan Senior Hurling Championship]] between 1990 and 2010. Mullahoran\u2019s dominance was finally broken by Ballymachugh who were runners up to Mullahoran 2005, 2008 and 2009. They beat Mullahoran in 2011 on a score of 4-08 to 1-06. No championship took place in 2012 and Mullahoran won their 22nd championship in 2013 beating Cootehill Celtic 0-13 to 0-04. \n\nIn 2011 after a disastrous Division 4 league campaign where they ended with a -157 scoring difference the decision was made to discontinue the senior hurling team resulting in Cavan being the only county in Ireland without a senior hurling representative team for nearly 6 years. \n\nCavan turned out a team for the first time in six years in 2017, and played in the [[Lory Meagher Cup]] in [[2017 Lory Meagher Cup|2017]], and re-entered the [[National Hurling League]] in [[2018 National Hurling League|2018]].\n\n===Honours===\n{{main|Cavan GAA Honours}}\nCavan won the [[Ulster Junior Hurling Championship]] in 1983 and 1985.

They lost consecutive finals in 1980 and 1981 losing to [[Tipperary GAA|Tipperary]] and [[Kerry GAA|Kerry]].  It wasn\u2019t until 2011 that Cavan next reached a Ladies All-Ireland final. They faced [[Westmeath GAA|Westmeath]]  in the [[All-Ireland Intermediate Ladies' Football Championship]] and lost after a replay. 2 years later they were back.

They lost to Galway by 4-4 to 0-3 in the 1940 All Ireland semi-final, but drew with Dublin in the 1941 semi-final 4-0 to 3-3, thanks to a last-minute goal from Rita Sullivan, losing the replay 3-4 to 1-1.

It is basically that way the Renaissance started with [[Pico della Mirandola]]'s ''[[Oration on the Dignity of Man]]'': you are not finalized to be here rather than anywhere else, thus you may accomplish your own selves.

The \"it\" in this conversation between two persons present is a symbolization of something absent. A symbol has thus substituted the leader of the flock seen in other animals growing out of their [[neoteny|neotenia]]n state. This abstract \"leader\" he calls \"The Grand Subject\" and has been referred to different symbolic powers throughout the ages: spirits, machinery of gods (like the Olympic gods), the monotheistic almighty God, the Proletariate, the Race and, lately, the neoliberal Market.<ref>[http://www.cairn.info/article.php?ID_REVUE=RAI&ID_NUMPUBLIE=RAI_002&ID_ARTICLE=RAI_002_0009 \u00ab Portrait du grand Sujet \u00bb in ''Raisons politiques'' (Presses de Sc. Po.)]</ref>\n\n== Deconstruction of (neo)liberal civilisation ==\n\n===Postmodernist change of minds===\nIn the book ''L'art de r\u00e9duire les t\u00eates'' (\"The Art of Shrinking Heads\"<ref>http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3340688-the-art-of-shrinking-heads</ref>) Dufour considers the [[postmodernism|postmodern]] change which [[Lyotard]] refers to as \"the end of the Grand Narrative\".\n \nThis new aspect suits [[liberalism]] in an excellent way, being more flexible than the old way of thinking to the everchanging circulation of merchandise, he claims.\n\n===A new religion===\nIn the book ''Le Divin March\u00e9, la r\u00e9volution culturelle lib\u00e9rale'' (\"The Divine Market, the Liberal Cultural Revolution\")<ref>http://www.gallimard.com/Catalogue/GALLIMARD/Folio/Folio-essais/Le-Divin-Marche</ref> Dufour tries to point out that we have come under the grip of a new victorious religion: the Divine Market, functioning on a simple but terribly efficient principle which [[Bernard Mandeville]] described in ''[[The Fable of the Bees]]'' in 1704: it is the vices (i.e., the self-regarding actions of men) which alone, by means of inventions and the circulation of capital in connection with luxurious living, stimulate society into action and progress. This \"miracle\" is produced by \"[[divine providence]]\", what [[Adam Smith]] was to call \"[[The Invisible Hand]]\".\n\nDufour also wants to point out that the liberal project tends to contradict the concept of \"school\" in Antiquity: Greek \u03c3\u03c7\u03bf\u03bb\u03ae (schol\u0113), Latin [[otium]] = free time, i.e. the time not employed to work or duties. This concept permitted the individual, before entering business life (Latin \"neg-otium\" = time not free), to create a mastering of mind not to be subject to uncontrolled passions, neither his own nor those of others.\n\nWe are thus left to distinguish between two contrary concepts of education: the classical one with self-control and the liberal one  where passions and urges on the loose are permitted. The more this latter educational project triumphs, the more the desymbolized world of drives and urges will protrude, according to Dufour. This world, however, creates a new problem: when no longer control of passions and urges is effected on a symbolic level, it must more and more be effected on a pure corporal level, inwards with pills and outwards with surveillance techniques \u2013 something happening not without implications for the function of democracy in liberal societies.\n\nMore generally this book describes and analyses \u2013 one year before the big [[Financial crisis of 2007\u201308]] \u2013 the potentially destructive effects of (neo)liberalism, not only on the market economy, but also and particularly on other fields of human expression such as [[politics]], use of symbols, [[semiotics]], [[psychology]]... And not to disregard what contains everything: how to handle one's own living.\n\n===A world of \"self love\"===\nIn ''La cit\u00e9 perverse \u2013 lib\u00e9ralisme et pornographie'',<ref>http://www.franceculture.fr/oeuvre-la-cit%C3%A9-perverse-lib%C3%A9ralisme-et-pornographie-de-dany-robert-dufour.html</ref> 2009 (''Perverted Society - Liberalism and Pornography'') Dufour attempts to display that the economical and financial crisis starting in October 2009 has provided us with at least one advantage: it has revealed the perverted mechanisms regulating the function of today's society.\n\nWe live in a world that has made [[selfishness|egoism]] ([[Adam Smith]]'s \"self love\"<ref>Adam Smith, An Inquiry into the Nature & Causes of the Wealth of Nations, Vol 1 ch 2 \"It is not from the benevolence of the butcher, the brewer, or the baker that we expect our dinner, but from their regard to their own self-interest. We address ourselves not to their humanity but to their self-love, and never talk to them of our own necessities, but of their advantages\u201d</ref>) its foremost principle. This principle henceforth commands all forms of conduct, whether in the uppermost classes, among juvenile dilinquents or the middle-classes. Destructive for the notions of \"being together\" or \"being your-self\" it urges us to live in a perverted society: [[pornography]], selfishness, contestation of every law whatsoever, acceptance of [[social darwinism]]. It makes [[Other (philosophy)|the Other]] a tool and results in our world becoming [[Marquis de Sade|de Sade]]-ish. It extolls henceforth the alliance between [[Adam Smith]] and [[Marquis de Sade]]. \n \nAgainst the old moral order, which summoned everyone to master his passions and urges, Dufour proposes that a new order has substituted the old one and that it is now, on the contrary,  fashionable to display one's passions and urges regardless of any consequences. He analyses today's world as a result of the revolution of western [[metaphysics]] during the century between [[Blaise Pascal|Pascal]]'s puritan philosophy and de Sade's porno fixated one (philosophie puritaine \u2013 philosophie \"putaine\").\n\nde Sade had so well demonstrated how a world subject to the principle of absolute egoism would appear that he was to be imprisoned for 27 years and his books to be concealed in the archives of libraries for two centuries. Dufour investigates de Sade's return, first masked, then overtly, during the 20th century and the world which will become the result of this. He also tries to indicate some ways to escape this (a)moral trap.\n\n::These three books might be qualified as a trilogy of criticism of the [[liberalism|liberal]] [[anthropology]].\n\n== Reconstruction of a humanistic civilisation ==\n\n===Renaissance 2.0===\n''L'individu qui vient \u2026 apr\u00e8s le lib\u00e9ralisme''<ref>[http://www.franceculture.fr/oeuvre-l-individu-qui-vient-apres-le-liberalisme-de-dany-robert-dufour.html]</ref> (\"The Individual that Appears \u2026 after liberalism\"), published in 2011, is a new step in Dufour's work. He considers that he has sufficiently [[deconstruction|deconstructed]] the liberal anthropology in his previous works and is now to enter a constructive line of work in his research for new possible [[axiom]]s for a real civilizational policy.\n\nHe first states that western civilization, after a century of two forceful turbulences, [[nazism]] and [[stalinism]], now is drawn into today's [[neoliberalism]]. This produces a crisis in a hitherto unseen extension, the nature of which is political, economical, ecological, moral, subjective, esthetical, intellectual \u2026\n\nDufour, however, sees nothing fatal in this third historical dead end during a century. As a philosopher he considers possibilities to resist this latest [[totalitarianism]] which step by step changes and destroys various expressions of human culture.\n\nDufour sees no other solution than resuming things where they have been discontinued by this new religion which he in his previous works has called ''le divin March\u00e9'' (The Divine Market). \nLike all religions a promise makes it function: salvation by continual growth of riches \u2013 a precipitous fleeing ahead leading to global devastation according to Dufour. To avoid such fate he proposes a return to the heart of civilization in order to find the necessary principles for a re-creation. In his opinion our civilization is in possession of the necessary resources for its [[renaissance]].\n\nFor this reason he proposes to map the foundations for that western narrative which has wrecked facing \"The Divine Market\".\nHe proposes to go back to [[Giovanni Pico della Mirandola]] and  his public  ''[[Oration on the Dignity of Man]]'' which has been called the \"Manifesto of the Renaissance\".\n\nWhat it is all about is the perspective of a new [[Renaissance]], new dynamics like those during the [[Quattrocento]] when knowledge was attained  how to retrieve the fundaments of Greek civilization and, supported by this, how to overcome the grip of obscure  tenets  dominating general thinking. What Dufour proposes then is to retrieve the civilizational process where it was interrupted in order to obtain the individual who dares to think and act by her/himself while giving the same right to [[Other (philosophy)|the Other]]. An individual cured from that egoism that is at present exalted to general law (Adam Smith's ''self love''). An individual well prepared to meet with any type of flock mentality whether in the form of fanatical mass movements or the present tyranny (without a tyrant) of mass consumption.\n\n===Today's civilization - a madness===\nIn ''Le d\u00e9lire occidental'' (Occidental Madness),<ref>http://livre.fnac.com/a7551982/Dany-Robert-Dufour-Le-delire-occidental, 2014</ref> Dufour starts from what [[Descartes]] argued in his ''[[Discourse on the Method]]'': humans make themselves masters and owners of nature. This marks a turn in human progress that has led to the gradual development of thinking in terms of machinery and productivity and the present boost of technology as supreme value.\n\nIf this occidental madness today causes problems, it is because it has become worldwide: the neoliberal globalization without limitation exploiting everything, including people and environment. A madness which, like all forms of madness, is doomed to crash against reality. On the one hand because its pretentious omnipotence and illimited arrogance inevitably blocks it: our earth is already forcefully reacting to the ongoing vandalization. On the other hand, because this madness in an obvious way changes the three basic spheres of human life, which are ''work, leisure'' and ''love'', by voiding them of all substance.\n*''Work'' is no longer creative, but [[Social alienation|alienating]] and mind-numbing as a result of  a more and more distorted organization of work ([[taylorism]], [[fordism]], [[toyotism]]/[[lean management]]).\n*''Leisure'', which once was working on and realisation of oneself ([[otium]]), is now invaded by [[consumerism]].\n*As to ''love'', it is profoundly reconfigurated in two ways: partly by transforming sensual [[eroticism]] into pornography, partly by unconditionally promising realisation of all forms of fancy. \n \nThis is thoroughly scrutinized in the book. \nYet, all is not lost: a new reason, free from this madness, is conjured up and the contours of it are sketched up.\n\n====Three madnesses \u2026====\nIn his book \"''La situation d\u00e9sesp\u00e9r\u00e9 du pr\u00e9sent me remplit d'espoir'' (The Present Situation Fills Me with Hope), 2016, Dany-Robert Dufour tries to illustrate how the ''Occidental madness'', founded on the \"will to always have more\" (what the Greeks called [[pleonexia]], greed), has resulted in nothing but provoking its contrary strife for purity. Which could be transformed into a new madness of \"fundamentalist\" expression, like for instance [[jihadism]], where the strife for a purity guaranteed by the original union with God, can alter into absolute igominy of spectacular deranged massacres of \"infidels\". This second madness leads in turn to a third madness, that of \"madness of identity\" which can cause civil wars in the search for \"alien elements\" to exterminate.\n\nThat is why the present day philosophical question, according to Dany-Robert Dufour, is about how to get out of these impasses.\n\n{{reflist}}\n\n== Bibliography ==\n\n{{Empty section|date=November 2015}}\n\n== Essays ==\n* ''Le B\u00e9gaiement des ma\u00eetres\u2009: [[Jacques Lacan|Lacan]], [[\u00c9mile Benveniste]], [[Claude L\u00e9vi-Strauss|L\u00e9vi-Strauss]]'', R\u00e9\u00e9d.

That is our basic frailness. But this frailness is also the beauty of man. That is what takes him out of the animal kingdom and lets him search his own way. It is basically that way the Renaissance started with [[Pico della Mirandola]]'s ''[[Oration on the Dignity of Man]]'': you are not finalized to be here rather than anywhere else, thus you may accomplish your own selves. That is a beautiful mission, because that is the part of liberty which God (if he exists) leaves us.

The \"it\" in this conversation between two persons present is a symbolization of something absent. A symbol has thus substituted the leader of the flock seen in other animals growing out of their [[neoteny|neotenia]]n state. This abstract \"leader\" he calls \"The Grand Subject\" and has been referred to different symbolic powers throughout the ages: spirits, machinery of gods (like the Olympic gods), the monotheistic almighty God, the Proletariate, the Race and, lately, the neoliberal Market.<ref>[http://www.cairn.info/article.php?ID_REVUE=RAI&ID_NUMPUBLIE=RAI_002&ID_ARTICLE=RAI_002_0009 \u00ab Portrait du grand Sujet \u00bb in ''Raisons politiques'' (Presses de Sc. Po.)]</ref>\n\n== Deconstruction of (neo)liberal civilisation ==\n\n===Postmodernist change of minds===\nIn the book ''L'art de r\u00e9duire les t\u00eates'' (\"The Art of Shrinking Heads\"<ref>http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3340688-the-art-of-shrinking-heads</ref>) Dufour considers the [[postmodernism|postmodern]] change which [[Lyotard]] refers to as \"the end of the Grand Narrative\".\n \nThis new aspect suits [[liberalism]] in an excellent way, being more flexible than the old way of thinking to the everchanging circulation of merchandise, he claims.\n\n===A new religion===\nIn the book ''Le Divin March\u00e9, la r\u00e9volution culturelle lib\u00e9rale'' (\"The Divine Market, the Liberal Cultural Revolution\")<ref>http://www.gallimard.com/Catalogue/GALLIMARD/Folio/Folio-essais/Le-Divin-Marche</ref> Dufour tries to point out that we have come under the grip of a new victorious religion: the Divine Market, functioning on a simple but terribly efficient principle which [[Bernard Mandeville]] described in ''[[The Fable of the Bees]]'' in 1704: it is the vices (i.e., the self-regarding actions of men) which alone, by means of inventions and the circulation of capital in connection with luxurious living, stimulate society into action and progress. This \"miracle\" is produced by \"[[divine providence]]\", what [[Adam Smith]] was to call \"[[The Invisible Hand]]\".\n\nDufour also wants to point out that the liberal project tends to contradict the concept of \"school\" in Antiquity: Greek \u03c3\u03c7\u03bf\u03bb\u03ae (schol\u0113), Latin [[otium]] = free time, i.e. the time not employed to work or duties. This concept permitted the individual, before entering business life (Latin \"neg-otium\" = time not free), to create a mastering of mind not to be subject to uncontrolled passions, neither his own nor those of others.\n\nWe are thus left to distinguish between two contrary concepts of education: the classical one with self-control and the liberal one  where passions and urges on the loose are permitted. The more this latter educational project triumphs, the more the desymbolized world of drives and urges will protrude, according to Dufour. This world, however, creates a new problem: when no longer control of passions and urges is effected on a symbolic level, it must more and more be effected on a pure corporal level, inwards with pills and outwards with surveillance techniques \u2013 something happening not without implications for the function of democracy in liberal societies.\n\nMore generally this book describes and analyses \u2013 one year before the big [[Financial crisis of 2007\u201308]] \u2013 the potentially destructive effects of (neo)liberalism, not only on the market economy, but also and particularly on other fields of human expression such as [[politics]], use of symbols, [[semiotics]], [[psychology]]... And not to disregard what contains everything: how to handle one's own living.\n\n===A world of \"self love\"===\nIn ''La cit\u00e9 perverse \u2013 lib\u00e9ralisme et pornographie'',<ref>http://www.franceculture.fr/oeuvre-la-cit%C3%A9-perverse-lib%C3%A9ralisme-et-pornographie-de-dany-robert-dufour.html</ref> 2009 (''Perverted Society - Liberalism and Pornography'') Dufour attempts to display that the economical and financial crisis starting in October 2009 has provided us with at least one advantage: it has revealed the perverted mechanisms regulating the function of today's society.\n\nWe live in a world that has made [[selfishness|egoism]] ([[Adam Smith]]'s \"self love\"<ref>Adam Smith, An Inquiry into the Nature & Causes of the Wealth of Nations, Vol 1 ch 2 \"It is not from the benevolence of the butcher, the brewer, or the baker that we expect our dinner, but from their regard to their own self-interest. We address ourselves not to their humanity but to their self-love, and never talk to them of our own necessities, but of their advantages\u201d</ref>) its foremost principle. This principle henceforth commands all forms of conduct, whether in the uppermost classes, among juvenile dilinquents or the middle-classes. Destructive for the notions of \"being together\" or \"being your-self\" it urges us to live in a perverted society: [[pornography]], selfishness, contestation of every law whatsoever, acceptance of [[social darwinism]]. It makes [[Other (philosophy)|the Other]] a tool and results in our world becoming [[Marquis de Sade|de Sade]]-ish. It extolls henceforth the alliance between [[Adam Smith]] and [[Marquis de Sade]]. \n \nAgainst the old moral order, which summoned everyone to master his passions and urges, Dufour proposes that a new order has substituted the old one and that it is now, on the contrary,  fashionable to display one's passions and urges regardless of any consequences. He analyses today's world as a result of the revolution of western [[metaphysics]] during the century between [[Blaise Pascal|Pascal]]'s puritan philosophy and de Sade's porno fixated one (philosophie puritaine \u2013 philosophie \"putaine\").\n\nde Sade had so well demonstrated how a world subject to the principle of absolute egoism would appear that he was to be imprisoned for 27 years and his books to be concealed in the archives of libraries for two centuries. Dufour investigates de Sade's return, first masked, then overtly, during the 20th century and the world which will become the result of this. He also tries to indicate some ways to escape this (a)moral trap.\n\n::These three books might be qualified as a trilogy of criticism of the [[liberalism|liberal]] [[anthropology]].\n\n== Reconstruction of a humanistic civilisation ==\n\n===Renaissance 2.0===\n''L'individu qui vient \u2026 apr\u00e8s le lib\u00e9ralisme''<ref>[http://www.franceculture.fr/oeuvre-l-individu-qui-vient-apres-le-liberalisme-de-dany-robert-dufour.html]</ref> (\"The Individual that Appears \u2026 after liberalism\"), published in 2011, is a new step in Dufour's work. He considers that he has sufficiently [[deconstruction|deconstructed]] the liberal anthropology in his previous works and is now to enter a constructive line of work in his research for new possible [[axiom]]s for a real civilizational policy.\n\nHe first states that western civilization, after a century of two forceful turbulences, [[nazism]] and [[stalinism]], now is drawn into today's [[neoliberalism]]. This produces a crisis in a hitherto unseen extension, the nature of which is political, economical, ecological, moral, subjective, esthetical, intellectual \u2026\n\nDufour, however, sees nothing fatal in this third historical dead end during a century. As a philosopher he considers possibilities to resist this latest [[totalitarianism]] which step by step changes and destroys various expressions of human culture.\n\nDufour sees no other solution than resuming things where they have been discontinued by this new religion which he in his previous works has called ''le divin March\u00e9'' (The Divine Market). \nLike all religions a promise makes it function: salvation by continual growth of riches \u2013 a precipitous fleeing ahead leading to global devastation according to Dufour. To avoid such fate he proposes a return to the heart of civilization in order to find the necessary principles for a re-creation.
