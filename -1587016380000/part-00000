The LADID hosts the Los Angeles Wholesale Produce Market, the second largest produce market in the United States. \n\n==Boundaries==\n\nThe LADID is bounded on the West by [[San Pedro Street]] from 8th Street to 7th Street and both sides of San Pedro from 7th Street to Third Street, on the North by Third Street, on the East by [[Alameda Street]], and on the South by [[Olympic Boulevard (Los Angeles)|Olympic Boulevard]] and 8th Street.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://clerk.cityofla.acsitefactory.com/sites/g/files/wph606/f/LACITYP_025495.pdf|title=Downtown Industrial District Business Improvement District Engineer's Report|publisher=Los Angeles City Clerk|website=clerk.lacity.org|date=May 2014|access-date=28 January 2020}}</ref>\n\n===Zones===\n\nThe [[business improvement district]] (BID) is divided into two distinct benefits zones.

Zone One also contains a number of non-profit social service providers. Zone One has the highest pedestrian counts and the highest demand for clean and safe services based on data from over 10 years of operation. The west boundary for zone one is the west boundary for the District. The north boundary is 3rd Street. The east boundary is Central Avenue and the south boundary is 8th Street.\n\nZone Two is predominately wholesale, industrial and market uses, including the Los Angeles Wholesale Produce Market, which have very little pedestrian traffic and operate predominately during the night hours.
