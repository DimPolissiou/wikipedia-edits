Counting past and present, more than half of the University's 200 Greek organizations remain active today, the pioneers of which have had a presence on the [[University of Minnesota]] campus for over 145 years. The university's \"Greek System\" includes [[Professional fraternities and sororities|professional fraternities]], [[Honor society|honor societies]], [[Service fraternities and sororities|service fraternities]], and religious fraternities along with the highly visible residential undergrad [[Fraternities and sororities|academic and social]] chapters.\n\nA '''[[#Academic and social fraternities and sororities|comprehensive list of chapters]]''', past and present, segmented by category, follows this brief overview of what these societies are and how they evolved.

Its first men's fraternity, [[Chi Psi]], dates to 1874, and its first women's fraternity, [[Kappa Kappa Gamma]], dates to 1880, long before the term 'sorority' was popularized as a term for the women's 'houses'.\n\nYet these pioneers did not themselves mark the beginnings of fraternal presence at the school.

Similarly, the age, prestige, size and breadth of the University of Minnesota have resulted in its hosting many of the nation's [[Honor societies|honor]] and [[Professional fraternities and sororities|professional]] fraternities for most disciplines.  As early as 1925, the ''Minnesota Gopher'' yearbook reported the presence of 25 national academic [[Fraternities and sororities in North America|fraternities]], 18 national academic [[Fraternities and sororities in North America#Sororities|sororities]], and 33 national professional chapters on campus.

Between 1900 and 1917, rentals gave way to properties built for the chapters, resulting in several iconic examples of Beaux Arts, Georgian and Classical styles. Finally, between 1921 and 1936, Minnesota's fraternity chapters engaged in that same popular [[North American fraternity and sorority housing|building spree]] which was sweeping across other early private and land grant colleges and universities from New York to California. The result of this last phase was the often stately homes occupied by many Greek chapters today, upgrades from boarding house-style clapboard and stucco homes, to the many ''Fraternity Row'' mansions that are visible at Minnesota along University Avenue SE, on 4th and 5th Street SE, and the 10th Avenue ''\"Sorority Row,\"'' all in Minneapolis. Similarly, the St. Paul campus is home to several stately chapter buildings, or chapterhouses, along Cleveland Avenue. It is a testament to the alumni of many of these chapters that their buildings survived, as so many were financed by the 1920s financial bubble, having endured weak membership eras during the Great Depression and then the twin turmoils of WWII and 1960s anti-establishment unrest.

Several recent remodeling and renovation programs have allowed significant improvement to some chapters, including recent full renovations by Chi Psi, Gamma Phi Beta, Kappa Alpha Theta, and Phi Sigma Kappa, along with completely rebuilt houses for Alpha Gamma Rho and FarmHouse. Lack of housing for fraternity and sororities, a community now grown to 15% of the student population in 2017 according to the OFSL, remains a hurdle that new groups must overcome. This dearth is only partially remedied by the opening of the new (2013) 17th Avenue Freshman Dorm.  This particular project has allowed two ground level rental suites along University Avenue for chapters new to campus, intended to serve as a long-term incubator.<ref name=\"OFSL2013\"/>\n\nThe Minneapolis City Council approved a number of zoning changes that relaxed restrictions on Greek ownership and renovation of properties near campus in action taken on 28 April 2017.

Incorporated alumni groups own the residential chapter buildings where they exist, serving in the role of property manager. Additional local alumni oversight varies by chapter. National organizations provide organizational and operational guidance, extending to disciplinary action where warranted. In partnership with national organizations, University oversight of the Academic and Social chapters is managed on a day-to-day basis by the [https://web.archive.org/web/20140717205551/http://www.fsl.umn.edu/index.html Office for Fraternity and Sorority Life], a unit of the [http://www.osa.umn.edu/ Office for Student Affairs].\n\nProfessional and Honor societies are coordinated at a lower level of administrative involvement by the various academic departments within the University and its several colleges, and of these, some operate merely cooperatively, with no involvement from the University at all.\n\nSince gaining its first chapter in 1874, Minnesota administrators have maintained an open, if not always supportive relationship with its chapters {{citation needed|date=May 2015}}. An impulse to exert administrative management on these highly visible registered student organizations has at times been offset by interest in limiting liability exposure where it could be claimed that the administration ''was'' responsible but ''did not do enough'' to prevent an unsafe or illegal occurrence. Minnesota's Greek System has, on balance, avoided the frequency of harmful events, as have occurred at other large schools; this primarily as the result of self-policing.<ref name=\"OFSL2013\" /><ref name=\"Nuwer\">[http://www.hanknuwer.com/hazing-deaths/ Hank Nuwer's list of global hazing incidents] does not show Minnesota among its extensive list of 'troubled' schools, accessed 27 May 2014</ref> The original, more active relationship between the Greeks and the Administration had been marginalized somewhat after the turbulent late 1960s and during the ''lassaiz-faire'' commuter-student years of 1970\u201390. This coincided with national scrutiny and bad publicity over hazing events elsewhere in the US. With the return to a more residential campus, both the Minnesota Greek System and its relationship with the University are thriving: An estimated 2,800 Greeks on campus participate in '''58''' separate undergraduate Academic and Social chapters.<ref name=\"OFSL2013\" /> In addition, Professional and honor societies, many accepting undergraduates, number more than 80. Because of this and other factors, the University is again improving its relationship with the Greek Community:\n\n<blockquote>In March 2012, President Kaler announced the formation of a Greek Community Strategic Task Force (GCSTF) and issued a Charge to the GCSTF Steering Committee which emphasized the need to develop a \"sustainable and robust relationship between the University and the Greek community.\"<ref name=\"GCSTF12\" /></blockquote>\n\n==Criticism==\n{{further|Fraternities_and_sororities#Criticism}}\nOver the decades, Minnesota's Greek system, like others nationwide, has had its detractors.  Most notably in the late 1960s, anti-establishment agitation resulted in decreased interest and participation. This negative environment abated with the end of the [[Vietnam War]]. While membership again surged beginning in the late 1970s, the campus population was swelling even faster. While hitting ''numeric'' highs, Greeks at Minnesota thus never achieved the pre-Vietnam era participation level as a ''percentage'' of the campus.  For some, Greeks were \"too exclusive.\" Commuting students may have had little occasion to socialize with them on the largely non-residential campus. Some students chafed at overt culture differences where Prep-era Greek men would wear blazers and ties to Monday meetings. Occasional surveys of detractors would declare a perception that membership was akin to buying friends.<ref name=\"GACSurvey\">Greek Action Committee Recruitment survey, 1984, IFC archives, accessed 16 June 2014</ref>  For others, it was simply a monetary concern, with a reluctance to include fraternity or sorority dues into a tight college budget.<ref name=\"GACSurvey\"/> The hugely popular movie, \"[[Animal House]]\" also branded for a generation the image of a lethargic, disruptive and academically inferior \"frat boy\" on the national consciousness.<ref>{{IMDb title|0077975|\"Animal House\"|- Hugely popular, this movie was a National Lampoon parody of writer Chris Miller's experiences at 1960s-era Dartmouth.}}</ref>\n\n===Response to criticism===\n\n====Fixing problems====\n\nGreek organizations both nationally and locally sponsor many risk avoidance programs for the real benefits of student safety and well-being, as well as to avoid harmful bad publicity. Hence, these organizations have learned to address criticism quickly: Chapters and national bodies have adopted extensive changes to reduce incidents of hazing and other harmful behaviors. The recent announcement by Sigma Alpha Epsilon to ban \"pledging\" nationwide is only the latest of such announcements, of revised prospective member programs now adopted by many fraternities.<ref>[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/03/11/sigma-alpha-epsilon-pledging-hazing_n_4938425.html Sigma Alpha Epsilon Bans Pledging Nationwide In Effort To Stop Hazing], as reported by the Huffington Post's Tyler Kingkade on 11 March 2014, accessed 11 June 2014</ref> While not limited to fraternities and sororities, harmful activities like underage drinking and hazing are often headlined as local news stories, with fraternity chapters as the most visible examples.<ref>Studies show that underage and binge drinking are more prevalent nationally among student athletes, Greek system members, and organization members, with the most significant grouping ''less'' affected by the problem being commuter students that live at home. See the [http://cspinet.org/booze/FactSheets/0311CollegeStudents.pdf Center for Science in the Public Interest: fact sheet] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131019061103/http://cspinet.org/booze/FactSheets/0311CollegeStudents.pdf |date=2013-10-19 }}, accessed 2 July 2014 and the [http://www.acui.org/publications/bulletin/article.aspx?issue=36080&id=18044 Association of College Unions International], and their 2012 analysis by Elizabeth Atwood, accessed 2 July 2014, for further reference.</ref>  In this area too, active and alumni Greek leaders have responded to such negative publicity and the resulting criticism with programs that seek to reduce alcohol abuse and eliminate underage or binge drinking, with risk management training, by self-policing their own chapters, and with more stringent procedures to discipline offenders. All sororities and some fraternity chapters have banned alcohol in their living facilities. National fraternities, through the [[North-American Interfraternity Conference|NIC]] and sororities through their national and local governing boards require member training each year to combat hazing, underage drinking, sexual assault and other harmful behaviors.<ref>[https://nicfraternity.org/nic-standards/ NIC Standards statement] accessed 21 Nov 2018.</ref> Hence, individual chapters are not alone in addressing these problems. Inter-chapter governing boards at Minnesota (listed below by chapter groupings) provide event monitoring services and local risk management training, culminating in the introduction in 2012 of '''Arkeo''', which serves as an inter-Greek cooperative monitoring program to help chapters avoid risk.<ref>[http://www.fsl.umn.edu/assets/pdf/comm_info/State%20of%20the%20Greek%20Sp%202013.pdf State of the Greek Community, 2013 Report] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304040843/http://www.fsl.umn.edu/assets/pdf/comm_info/State%20of%20the%20Greek%20Sp%202013.pdf |date=2016-03-04 }}, accessed 11 June 2014</ref><ref name=\"DefyingCritics\">[http://www.fsl.umn.edu/parents/greek_sterotypes.html Office for Fraternity and Sorority Life risk management statement on \"Defying the Stereotypes\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714162943/http://www.fsl.umn.edu/parents/greek_sterotypes.html |date=2014-07-14 }}, accessed 12 June 2014</ref>\n\n====Response to perceptions====\n\nAs to the financial cost of participation, fraternity leaders note that the vast majority of Greek students work their way through school.<ref name=\"DefyingCritics\" /> In fact, the Office of Fraternity and Sorority Life claims that the average cost burden for fraternity chapter membership adds 3% to a student budget, and may indeed be less costly on a net basis when factoring reduced summer rents and lower live-in costs versus dorms and private apartments. Finally, the Minnesota campus is markedly more residential than thirty years ago. Development of over a dozen large for-profit private dorms and many upgraded apartments has increased the average ''quality'' and ''quantity'' of near-campus housing ''and'' has increased their average expense. The result has been that fraternities and sororities, previously perceived as among the more expensive housing options now range from \"in line with\" or even lower than the average cost of dorms or apartments.<ref>[http://www.startribune.com/university-of-minnesota-sees-resurgence-of-interest-in-greek-life/223334431/ StarTrib article on resurgence of interest in Greek Life], accessed 4 Sept 2016</ref><ref name=\"2016 IFC Study\">For reference, see the 2016 Interfraternity Council recruitment book, p.8.

These average expenses both compare favorably to living in a private apartment with an average cost of $10,056, which does not include meals, parking or social events, and which requires a sublease if the apartment is vacated during the summer months. Sorority living expenses may be higher, with increased services. For further analysis of these costs, see University Housing Services. The analysis is more involved than can be fully treated here due to space limitations.</ref>\n\nAddressing the claim of exclusivity in recruitment materials, Greek leaders will accept that label as another way of saying they promote high standards. All fraternities are by definition self-selective.  But, they clarify, so are all friendships. Further, they state, \"U\" students all have passed a bar of exclusivity by getting into the increasingly selective University itself. With an array of student groups numbering in the thousands, and a multitude of Greek chapter personalities, fraternity and sorority proponents are confident that all students who wish to join a Greek society can find one where they can flourish.<ref name=\"DefyingCritics\" /> The matter of religious and race exclusivity appears to have passed several generations ago: While some chapters are historically black, Hispanic, or Asian-oriented, there is no race exclusivity or other discrimination exclusivity in any of Minnesota's chapters. All are integrated, and have been for some time. Minnesota was the second Big Ten school (after [[University of Wisconsin|Wisconsin]]) to see its fraternities and sororities drop all bias clauses (race, color or creed) from their bylaws and policies. Older chapters have been integrated since the 1950s and 1960s<ref name=\"HistoricalStudy2003\" /> and the multi-cultural Greek chapters since their founding in more recent years.<ref>[https://diversity.umn.edu/eoaa/ The University Department of Equal Opportunity] requires all members of University communities to adhere to this standard, but has not seen a need for intervention in Minnesota's fully integrated community of Greek chapters.

According to the \u0398\u039d\u0395 website, the ''Tau'' designation was \"fancied by the chapter,\" and ''Chi'' was also considered, before ''Alpha Epsilon'' was allowed.  \u0398\u039d\u0395's Wikipedia page notes (without clear citation) possible activity at Minnesota as late as 1934, which the lack of a ''Gopher'' record shows is unlikely.</ref><ref name=\"Theta Nu Epsilon perception\">Baird's and other sources note \u0398\u039d\u0395 was an ill-favored national due to its recruitment of sophomores who were already members of other fraternities, and a policy of secrecy about the active members - those same sophomores tapped each year. It was NOT an honorary, nor a service society. (Freshmen were discluded, juniors and seniors were advisoral only.) Hence, \u0398\u039d\u0395 became a bit of a pariah, and members were pressured to quit lest they be expelled from their primary fraternities at Minnesota (see \u03a6\u03a3\u039a Rand History); in 1913 the NIC advocated ''vigorously against'' its collegians joining \u0398\u039d\u0395. Struggling for a workable path to legitimacy, several varying models developed on \u0398\u039d\u0395's campuses, where some chapters became standard fraternities, and others public inter-fraternity groups. At Alabama it even became a political machine, while other chapters took yet other forms. Later, with adoption of changes, \u0398\u039d\u0395 briefly joined the NIC in the 1930s, but ceased operations after WWII. Several chapters reformed the society as a smaller entity, some becoming co-ed in the 1970s.

They are currently not grouped with the social fraternities and sororities.<ref name=\"OFSL2017\" /> However, some also associate with social fraternities and societies. They may also use of chapter and national organizational hierarchy, and their use of Greek Letters as identification. Some of these are populated by graduate students, a few exclusively so. As a rule, the honor and professional societies focus on specific academic, professional or service missions. Historically too there has been significant crossover and cooperation between types; some professional societies have revised themselves into non-residential honor groups. In contrast, several professional organizations have gone the other direction to conference among the academic and social chapters.<ref>This crossover is apparent in many examples: [[Alpha Gamma Rho]] fraternity became an [[North-American Interfraternity Conference|NIC]] member while ''retaining'' its membership in the [[Professional Fraternity Association|PHA]]. Born as a professional fraternity, by 1917 it had begun to operate as a social and academic fraternity, requiring 'exclusivity' of its members, i.e.: they couldn't be part of another social or academic society. In 1944 [[FarmHouse]] fraternity made a similar move. Like AGR, both retain a focus on agriculture. [[Delta Chi]] fraternity began as a Law fraternity, conferencing with similar societies it its early days, while by 1911 moving exclusively into what would become the NIC camp. Minnesota's was the fourth oldest chapter of this national and was a participant in this evolution. A number of multicultural fraternities such as [[Alpha Phi Alpha]] are members of both the [[National Pan-Hellenic Council|NPHC]] as well as the NIC. [[Evans Scholars Foundation|Evans Scholars]], an honorary fraternity for golf caddies whose [http://minnesota.evansscholars.org/site/c.5nJIJQPnEhKWE/b.7924611/k.BD08/Home.htm Eta chapter] (accessed 3 Dec 2017) occupies a home among the undergraduate Greeks, operates as a social and academic residential chapter and maintains a full social schedule among the NIC and NPC fraternities and sororities. City codes group all such property-owning organizations together, regulating them as similar to boarding houses. Sale or rental of properties between groups has occurred cooperatively for well over a century. To summarize, rather than exhibiting hard-and-fast lines of demarcation that separate social, professional or honor types of organizations, these societies appear to flex, cooperate and adjust over time with the demands of participants, becoming more or less vigorous (residential, social, 'programmed') in a slow but steady evolution.</ref> But most remain oriented toward senior students (including 3rd and 4th year students) and graduate students. Social/academic fraternity or sorority membership is not a requirement for these groups. Individuals who meet a group's criteria may join or be \"tapped,\" or asked to join, as may non-Greek students.  Multiple affiliations may be allowable as membership is frequently not exclusive to one group - see individual societies for details.  Activity varies; some of the professional and service groups are residential, while the honors societies may meet only quarterly or annually, if at all. The cut-off line where any campus organization falls ''within'' these headings or ''without'' is by long-established convention; those formed prior to 1990 are listed under the subheadings used by various volumes of the [[Baird's Manual of American College Fraternities]], which for more than a century has been the data source of record for such organizations.  Newer groups have been placed in categories similar to Baird's. The latest version of Baird's, 1991,  was published ''before'' the national development of some of the societies here, and therefore, position and inclusion is, in some cases, assumptive.<ref name=\"Baird's\" />\n\n[[File:Phi Beta Kappa Key.png|thumb|right|x200px|The Phi Beta Kappa Key. Minnesota's chapter was formed in 1892.]]\n\n===[[Honor society|Honor and recognition societies]]===\nHonor societies recognize students who excel academically or as leaders among their peers, usually within a specific academic discipline. Because of the age, size and research focus of the University of Minnesota, it hosts a wide variety of these organizations. Members commonly include the society on their r\u00e9sum\u00e9/CV, which may serve to bolster grad school acceptance, publishing merit, and professional opportunities.\n\nListed by date of local founding with national conference membership, these are co-ed, non-residential, achievement-based organizations which self-select members based on published criteria.\n\nAt graduation, or at times of formal academic processionals, graduates, administrators, PhD holders and post-doctoral fellows wear [[Academic regalia in the United States|academic robes]] in the colors of their degree, school and other distinction, according to a voluntary Intercollegiate Code that governs customs such as formal academic regalia. In addition, various colored devices such as [[Academic stole|stoles]], [[Academic scarf|scarfs]], [[Honor cords|cords]], [[Square academic cap#tassel|tassels]], and medallions are used to indicate membership in a student's honor society; cords and [[Square academic cap|mortarboard]] tassels are most common. '''[[Phi Beta Kappa]]''', the first honor society, locally founded at Minnesota in 1892, has used {{color box|#FFC0CB}} [[Pink]] and {{color box|#87CEEB}} [[Sky blue]] since its national founding in 1776.  Hence, students tapped for \u03a6\u0392\u039a may wear tassels or other society-approved items, in these colors. Like most schools, the University of Minnesota allows such regalia for honor society members. Stoles are less common, but they are used by a few honor societies. In academic circles, colors are well-known, and follow long-standing protocols. [http://www.achsnatl.org/honor_cord_registry.asp The ACHS website lists the colors] for their 68 member organizations, and the [[Honor society]] WP page lists others. [[File:Graduating students.JPG|thumb|left|x160px|Multi-colored tassels, cords and stoles are noticeable over black graduation robes.]]<!--This photo should be updated to a free-use photo of University of Minnesota grads, showing honors colors-->\n\nMany honor societies invite students to become members based on scholastic rank (the top x% of a class) and/or grade point, either overall, or for classes taken within the discipline for which the honor society provides recognition. In cases where academic achievement would not be an appropriate criterion for membership, other standards are required for membership (such as completion of a particular ceremony or training program). These societies recognize ''past achievement.'' Pledging is ''not'' required, and new candidates may be immediately inducted into membership after meeting predetermined academic criteria and paying a one-time membership fee. Some require graduate enrollment.  Because of their purpose of recognition, most honor societies will have much higher academic achievement requirements for membership than professional societies. It is also common for a scholastic honor society to add a criterion relating to the character of the student. Some honor societies are ''invitation only'' while others allow unsolicited applications. Finally, membership in an honor society might be considered exclusive, i.e., a member of such an organization cannot join other honor societies representing the same field. Governance requires a faculty sponsor and each society remains faculty-guided, usually with alumni input.<br>\n(ACHS) indicates members of the [[Association of College Honor Societies]].\n\n'''''Active honor and recognition societies'''''\n{{col-start}}\n{{col-break|width=34%}}\n* '''\u03a6\u0394\u03a6''' - [[Phi Delta Phi]], 1891, legal honors<ref>Note, until 2012, \u03a6\u0394\u03a6 had nationally been a ''professional'' fraternity.

Some are residential in a co-operative fashion and all offer a moderate amount of social programming. Membership in a professional fraternity may be gained by the result of a pledge process, much like a social fraternity, and members are expected to remain loyal and active in the organization for life. Within their professional field of study, membership is exclusive; for example, if one joins a law society they cannot join another law society. However, these societies do initiate members who belong to social or honors fraternities. Professional Societies are known for networking and post-collegiate involvement, and membership is often included with pride on a r\u00e9sum\u00e9/CV.

Similarly, the age, prestige, size and breadth of the University of Minnesota have resulted in its hosting many of the nation's [[Honor societies|honor]] and [[Professional fraternities and sororities|professional]] fraternities for most disciplines.

Between 1900 and 1917, rentals gave way to properties built for the chapters, resulting in several iconic examples of Beaux Arts, Georgian and Classical styles. Finally, between 1921 and 1936, Minnesota's fraternity chapters engaged in that same popular [[North American fraternity and sorority housing|building spree]] which was sweeping across other early private and land grant colleges and universities from New York to California. The result of this last phase was the often stately homes occupied by many Greek chapters today, upgrades from boarding house-style clapboard and stucco homes, to the many ''Fraternity Row'' mansions that are visible at Minnesota along University Avenue SE, on 4th and 5th Street SE, and the 10th Avenue ''\"Sorority Row,\"'' all in Minneapolis. Similarly, the St. Paul campus is home to several stately chapter buildings, or chapterhouses, along Cleveland Avenue. It is a testament to the alumni of many of these chapters that their buildings survived, as so many were financed by the 1920s financial bubble, having endured weak membership eras during the Great Depression and then the twin turmoils of WWII and 1960s anti-establishment unrest.

Several recent remodeling and renovation programs have allowed significant improvement to some chapters, including recent full renovations by Chi Psi, Gamma Phi Beta, Kappa Alpha Theta, and Phi Sigma Kappa, along with completely rebuilt houses for Alpha Gamma Rho and FarmHouse. Lack of housing for fraternity and sororities, a community now grown to 15% of the student population in 2017 according to the OFSL, remains a hurdle that new groups must overcome. This dearth is only partially remedied by the opening of the new (2013) 17th Avenue Freshman Dorm.

Incorporated alumni groups own the residential chapter buildings where they exist, serving in the role of property manager. Additional local alumni oversight varies by chapter. National organizations provide organizational and operational guidance, extending to disciplinary action where warranted. In partnership with national organizations, University oversight of the Academic and Social chapters is managed on a day-to-day basis by the [https://web.archive.org/web/20140717205551/http://www.fsl.umn.edu/index.html Office for Fraternity and Sorority Life], a unit of the [http://www.osa.umn.edu/ Office for Student Affairs].\n\nProfessional and Honor societies are coordinated at a lower level of administrative involvement by the various academic departments within the University and its several colleges, and of these, some operate merely cooperatively, with no involvement from the University at all.\n\nSince gaining its first chapter in 1874, Minnesota administrators have maintained an open, if not always supportive relationship with its chapters {{citation needed|date=May 2015}}. An impulse to exert administrative management on these highly visible registered student organizations has at times been offset by interest in limiting liability exposure where it could be claimed that the administration ''was'' responsible but ''did not do enough'' to prevent an unsafe or illegal occurrence. Minnesota's Greek System has, on balance, avoided the frequency of harmful events, as have occurred at other large schools; this primarily as the result of self-policing.<ref name=\"OFSL2013\" /><ref name=\"Nuwer\">[http://www.hanknuwer.com/hazing-deaths/ Hank Nuwer's list of global hazing incidents] does not show Minnesota among its extensive list of 'troubled' schools, accessed 27 May 2014</ref> The original, more active relationship between the Greeks and the Administration had been marginalized somewhat after the turbulent late 1960s and during the ''lassaiz-faire'' commuter-student years of 1970\u201390. This coincided with national scrutiny and bad publicity over hazing events elsewhere in the US. With the return to a more residential campus, both the Minnesota Greek System and its relationship with the University are thriving: An estimated 2,800 Greeks on campus participate in '''58''' separate undergraduate Academic and Social chapters.<ref name=\"OFSL2013\" /> In addition, Professional and honor societies, many accepting undergraduates, number more than 80. Because of this and other factors, the University is again improving its relationship with the Greek Community:\n\n<blockquote>In March 2012, President Kaler announced the formation of a Greek Community Strategic Task Force (GCSTF) and issued a Charge to the GCSTF Steering Committee which emphasized the need to develop a \"sustainable and robust relationship between the University and the Greek community.\"<ref name=\"GCSTF12\" /></blockquote>\n\n==Criticism==\n{{further|Fraternities_and_sororities#Criticism}}\nOver the decades, Minnesota's Greek system, like others nationwide, has had its detractors.  Most notably in the late 1960s, anti-establishment agitation resulted in decreased interest and participation. This negative environment abated with the end of the [[Vietnam War]]. While membership again surged beginning in the late 1970s, the campus population was swelling even faster. While hitting ''numeric'' highs, Greeks at Minnesota thus never achieved the pre-Vietnam era participation level as a ''percentage'' of the campus.  For some, Greeks were \"too exclusive.\" Commuting students may have had little occasion to socialize with them on the largely non-residential campus. Some students chafed at overt culture differences where Prep-era Greek men would wear blazers and ties to Monday meetings. Occasional surveys of detractors would declare a perception that membership was akin to buying friends.<ref name=\"GACSurvey\">Greek Action Committee Recruitment survey, 1984, IFC archives, accessed 16 June 2014</ref>  For others, it was simply a monetary concern, with a reluctance to include fraternity or sorority dues into a tight college budget.<ref name=\"GACSurvey\"/> The hugely popular movie, \"[[Animal House]]\" also branded for a generation the image of a lethargic, disruptive and academically inferior \"frat boy\" on the national consciousness.<ref>{{IMDb title|0077975|\"Animal House\"|- Hugely popular, this movie was a National Lampoon parody of writer Chris Miller's experiences at 1960s-era Dartmouth.}}</ref>\n\n===Response to criticism===\n\n====Fixing problems====\n\nGreek organizations both nationally and locally sponsor many risk avoidance programs for the real benefits of student safety and well-being, as well as to avoid harmful bad publicity. Hence, these organizations have learned to address criticism quickly: Chapters and national bodies have adopted extensive changes to reduce incidents of hazing and other harmful behaviors. The recent announcement by Sigma Alpha Epsilon to ban \"pledging\" nationwide is only the latest of such announcements, of revised prospective member programs now adopted by many fraternities.<ref>[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/03/11/sigma-alpha-epsilon-pledging-hazing_n_4938425.html Sigma Alpha Epsilon Bans Pledging Nationwide In Effort To Stop Hazing], as reported by the Huffington Post's Tyler Kingkade on 11 March 2014, accessed 11 June 2014</ref> While not limited to fraternities and sororities, harmful activities like underage drinking and hazing are often headlined as local news stories, with fraternity chapters as the most visible examples.<ref>Studies show that underage and binge drinking are more prevalent nationally among student athletes, Greek system members, and organization members, with the most significant grouping ''less'' affected by the problem being commuter students that live at home.

All sororities and some fraternity chapters have banned alcohol in their living facilities. National fraternities, through the [[North-American Interfraternity Conference|NIC]] and sororities through their national and local governing boards require member training each year to combat hazing, underage drinking, sexual assault and other harmful behaviors.<ref>[https://nicfraternity.org/nic-standards/ NIC Standards statement] accessed 21 Nov 2018.</ref> Hence, individual chapters are not alone in addressing these problems.

Finally, the Minnesota campus is markedly more residential than thirty years ago. Development of over a dozen large for-profit private dorms and many upgraded apartments has increased the average ''quality'' and ''quantity'' of near-campus housing ''and'' has increased their average expense. The result has been that fraternities and sororities, previously perceived as among the more expensive housing options now range from \"in line with\" or even lower than the average cost of dorms or apartments.<ref>[http://www.startribune.com/university-of-minnesota-sees-resurgence-of-interest-in-greek-life/223334431/ StarTrib article on resurgence of interest in Greek Life], accessed 4 Sept 2016</ref><ref name=\"2016 IFC Study\">For reference, see the 2016 Interfraternity Council recruitment book, p.8.

These average expenses both compare favorably to living in a private apartment with an average cost of $10,056, which does not include meals, parking or social events, and which requires a sublease if the apartment is vacated during the summer months. Sorority living expenses may be higher, with increased services. For further analysis of these costs, see University Housing Services. The analysis is more involved than can be fully treated here due to space limitations.</ref>\n\nAddressing the claim of exclusivity in recruitment materials, Greek leaders will accept that label as another way of saying they promote high standards. All fraternities are by definition self-selective.  But, they clarify, so are all friendships. Further, they state, \"U\" students all have passed a bar of exclusivity by getting into the increasingly selective University itself. With an array of student groups numbering in the thousands, and a multitude of Greek chapter personalities, fraternity and sorority proponents are confident that all students who wish to join a Greek society can find one where they can flourish.<ref name=\"DefyingCritics\" /> The matter of religious and race exclusivity appears to have passed several generations ago: While some chapters are historically black, Hispanic, or Asian-oriented, there is no race exclusivity or other discrimination exclusivity in any of Minnesota's chapters. All are integrated, and have been for some time. Minnesota was the second Big Ten school (after [[University of Wisconsin|Wisconsin]]) to see its fraternities and sororities drop all bias clauses (race, color or creed) from their bylaws and policies. Older chapters have been integrated since the 1950s and 1960s<ref name=\"HistoricalStudy2003\" /> and the multi-cultural Greek chapters since their founding in more recent years.<ref>[https://diversity.umn.edu/eoaa/ The University Department of Equal Opportunity] requires all members of University communities to adhere to this standard, but has not seen a need for intervention in Minnesota's fully integrated community of Greek chapters.

However, the non-NPC sorority Clovia on the St. Paul campus ''does'' have a non-Greek letter name, as do several professional, honor and religious national organizations.</ref> The main listing for each fraternity or sorority shows their full name at least once, with references and Wikilinks as available.\n\n===Fraternities constituting the Interfraternity Council (IFC)===\nListed with dates of local founding and national conference membership, these are men's organizations at the [[University of Minnesota]], voluntarily coordinating their efforts within the campus IFC. While most IFC chapters are based in Minneapolis, several call St. Paul their home. After a period of level membership, for various reasons, fraternity membership is increasing rapidly.  Average chapter size is 50, and several chapters exceed 100 men.\n\nFraternity buildings are generally owned by chapter alumni organizations.  Some chapters are non-residential, while a few rent or lease space.\n\nAs part of IFC or national organization self-governance, or University disciplinary action, chapters may be suspended (\"de-recognized\") or closed for a time. When a chapter is closed and/or forfeits its housing, it will be listed as a dormant chapter.

This incorrect name was a deliberate error. According to the \u0398\u039d\u0395 website, the ''Tau'' designation was \"fancied by the chapter,\" and ''Chi'' was also considered, before ''Alpha Epsilon'' was allowed.  \u0398\u039d\u0395's Wikipedia page notes (without clear citation) possible activity at Minnesota as late as 1934, which the lack of a ''Gopher'' record shows is unlikely.</ref><ref name=\"Theta Nu Epsilon perception\">Baird's and other sources note \u0398\u039d\u0395 was an ill-favored national due to its recruitment of sophomores who were already members of other fraternities, and a policy of secrecy about the active members - those same sophomores tapped each year. It was NOT an honorary, nor a service society. (Freshmen were discluded, juniors and seniors were advisoral only.) Hence, \u0398\u039d\u0395 became a bit of a pariah, and members were pressured to quit lest they be expelled from their primary fraternities at Minnesota (see \u03a6\u03a3\u039a Rand History); in 1913 the NIC advocated ''vigorously against'' its collegians joining \u0398\u039d\u0395. Struggling for a workable path to legitimacy, several varying models developed on \u0398\u039d\u0395's campuses, where some chapters became standard fraternities, and others public inter-fraternity groups. At Alabama it even became a political machine, while other chapters took yet other forms. Later, with adoption of changes, \u0398\u039d\u0395 briefly joined the NIC in the 1930s, but ceased operations after WWII. Several chapters reformed the society as a smaller entity, some becoming co-ed in the 1970s.

They are currently not grouped with the social fraternities and sororities.<ref name=\"OFSL2017\" /> However, some also associate with social fraternities and societies. They may also use of chapter and national organizational hierarchy, and their use of Greek Letters as identification. Some of these are populated by graduate students, a few exclusively so. As a rule, the honor and professional societies focus on specific academic, professional or service missions. Historically too there has been significant crossover and cooperation between types; some professional societies have revised themselves into non-residential honor groups. In contrast, several professional organizations have gone the other direction to conference among the academic and social chapters.<ref>This crossover is apparent in many examples: [[Alpha Gamma Rho]] fraternity became an [[North-American Interfraternity Conference|NIC]] member while ''retaining'' its membership in the [[Professional Fraternity Association|PHA]]. Born as a professional fraternity, by 1917 it had begun to operate as a social and academic fraternity, requiring 'exclusivity' of its members, i.e.: they couldn't be part of another social or academic society. In 1944 [[FarmHouse]] fraternity made a similar move. Like AGR, both retain a focus on agriculture. [[Delta Chi]] fraternity began as a Law fraternity, conferencing with similar societies it its early days, while by 1911 moving exclusively into what would become the NIC camp. Minnesota's was the fourth oldest chapter of this national and was a participant in this evolution. A number of multicultural fraternities such as [[Alpha Phi Alpha]] are members of both the [[National Pan-Hellenic Council|NPHC]] as well as the NIC. [[Evans Scholars Foundation|Evans Scholars]], an honorary fraternity for golf caddies whose [http://minnesota.evansscholars.org/site/c.5nJIJQPnEhKWE/b.7924611/k.BD08/Home.htm Eta chapter] (accessed 3 Dec 2017) occupies a home among the undergraduate Greeks, operates as a social and academic residential chapter and maintains a full social schedule among the NIC and NPC fraternities and sororities. City codes group all such property-owning organizations together, regulating them as similar to boarding houses. Sale or rental of properties between groups has occurred cooperatively for well over a century. To summarize, rather than exhibiting hard-and-fast lines of demarcation that separate social, professional or honor types of organizations, these societies appear to flex, cooperate and adjust over time with the demands of participants, becoming more or less vigorous (residential, social, 'programmed') in a slow but steady evolution.</ref> But most remain oriented toward senior students (including 3rd and 4th year students) and graduate students. Social/academic fraternity or sorority membership is not a requirement for these groups. Individuals who meet a group's criteria may join or be \"tapped,\" or asked to join, as may non-Greek students.  Multiple affiliations may be allowable as membership is frequently not exclusive to one group - see individual societies for details.  Activity varies; some of the professional and service groups are residential, while the honors societies may meet only quarterly or annually, if at all. The cut-off line where any campus organization falls ''within'' these headings or ''without'' is by long-established convention; those formed prior to 1990 are listed under the subheadings used by various volumes of the [[Baird's Manual of American College Fraternities]], which for more than a century has been the data source of record for such organizations.  Newer groups have been placed in categories similar to Baird's. The latest version of Baird's, 1991,  was published ''before'' the national development of some of the societies here, and therefore, position and inclusion is, in some cases, assumptive.<ref name=\"Baird's\" />\n\n[[File:Phi Beta Kappa Key.png|thumb|right|x200px|The Phi Beta Kappa Key. Minnesota's chapter was formed in 1892.]]\n\n===[[Honor society|Honor and recognition societies]]===\nHonor societies recognize students who excel academically or as leaders among their peers, usually within a specific academic discipline. Because of the age, size and research focus of the University of Minnesota, it hosts a wide variety of these organizations. Members commonly include the society on their r\u00e9sum\u00e9/CV, which may serve to bolster grad school acceptance, publishing merit, and professional opportunities.\n\nListed by date of local founding with national conference membership, these are co-ed, non-residential, achievement-based organizations which self-select members based on published criteria.\n\nAt graduation, or at times of formal academic processionals, graduates, administrators, PhD holders and post-doctoral fellows wear [[Academic regalia in the United States|academic robes]] in the colors of their degree, school and other distinction, according to a voluntary Intercollegiate Code that governs customs such as formal academic regalia. In addition, various colored devices such as [[Academic stole|stoles]], [[Academic scarf|scarfs]], [[Honor cords|cords]], [[Square academic cap#tassel|tassels]], and medallions are used to indicate membership in a student's honor society; cords and [[Square academic cap|mortarboard]] tassels are most common. '''[[Phi Beta Kappa]]''', the first honor society, locally founded at Minnesota in 1892, has used {{color box|#FFC0CB}} [[Pink]] and {{color box|#87CEEB}} [[Sky blue]] since its national founding in 1776.  Hence, students tapped for \u03a6\u0392\u039a may wear tassels or other society-approved items, in these colors. Like most schools, the University of Minnesota allows such regalia for honor society members. Stoles are less common, but they are used by a few honor societies. In academic circles, colors are well-known, and follow long-standing protocols. [http://www.achsnatl.org/honor_cord_registry.asp The ACHS website lists the colors] for their 68 member organizations, and the [[Honor society]] WP page lists others. [[File:Graduating students.JPG|thumb|left|x160px|Multi-colored tassels, cords and stoles are noticeable over black graduation robes.]]<!--This photo should be updated to a free-use photo of University of Minnesota grads, showing honors colors-->\n\nMany honor societies invite students to become members based on scholastic rank (the top x% of a class) and/or grade point, either overall, or for classes taken within the discipline for which the honor society provides recognition. In cases where academic achievement would not be an appropriate criterion for membership, other standards are required for membership (such as completion of a particular ceremony or training program). These societies recognize ''past achievement.'' Pledging is ''not'' required, and new candidates may be immediately inducted into membership after meeting predetermined academic criteria and paying a one-time membership fee. Some require graduate enrollment.  Because of their purpose of recognition, most honor societies will have much higher academic achievement requirements for membership than professional societies. It is also common for a scholastic honor society to add a criterion relating to the character of the student. Some honor societies are ''invitation only'' while others allow unsolicited applications. Finally, membership in an honor society might be considered exclusive, i.e., a member of such an organization cannot join other honor societies representing the same field. Governance requires a faculty sponsor and each society remains faculty-guided, usually with alumni input.<br>\n(ACHS) indicates members of the [[Association of College Honor Societies]].\n\n'''''Active honor and recognition societies'''''\n{{col-start}}\n{{col-break|width=34%}}\n* '''\u03a6\u0394\u03a6''' - [[Phi Delta Phi]], 1891, legal honors<ref>Note, until 2012, \u03a6\u0394\u03a6 had nationally been a ''professional'' fraternity.

Some are residential in a co-operative fashion and all offer a moderate amount of social programming. Membership in a professional fraternity may be gained by the result of a pledge process, much like a social fraternity, and members are expected to remain loyal and active in the organization for life. Within their professional field of study, membership is exclusive; for example, if one joins a law society they cannot join another law society. However, these societies do initiate members who belong to social or honors fraternities. Professional Societies are known for networking and post-collegiate involvement, and membership is often included with pride on a r\u00e9sum\u00e9/CV.

[[Incumbent]] Republican U.S. Senator [[Peter Fitzgerald (politician)|Peter Fitzgerald]] decided to retire after one term. The Democratic and Republican [[primary election]]s were held in March, which included a total of 15 candidates who combined to spend a record total of over $60 million seeking the [[open seat]].\n\nOn March 16, 2004, State Senator [[Barack Obama]] won the Democratic primary, and businessman [[Jack Ryan (politician)|Jack Ryan]] won the Republican primary. Three months later, Ryan announced his withdrawal from the race four days after the [[Chicago Tribune]] persuaded a California court to release records from Ryan's divorce case, which included allegations that Ryan had pressured his then-wife actress [[Jeri Ryan]] to perform sexual acts in public.\n\nSix weeks later, the Illinois Republican State Central Committee chose former Diplomat [[Alan Keyes]] to replace Ryan as the Republican candidate. The election was the first for the U.S. Senate in which both major party candidates were [[African American]]. Obama won by 43%, the largest margin of victory in the state history of U.S. Senate elections, and served in the Senate for four years until he was [[2008 United States presidential election|elected President]] in 2008. The inequality in the candidates spending for the fall elections \u2013 $14,244,768 by Obama and $2,545,325 by Keyes \u2013 is also among the largest in history in both [[absolute and relative terms]].<ref>{{Cite book | url=https://archive.org/details/electio_xxx_2006_00_4209/page/195 | last=Jacobson | first=Gary C. | title=The First Congressional Elections After BCRA | work=The Election After Reform: Money, Politics and the Bipartisan Campaign RDUNIAt | publisher=Rowman and Littlefield | isbn=978-0742538702 | page=[https://archive.org/details/electio_xxx_2006_00_4209/page/195 195] | date=March 30, 2006 | accessdate=October 27, 2012 }}</ref>\n\n==Election information==\nThe primaries and general elections coincided with those for [[2004 United States presidential election in Illinois|United States President]] and [[2004 United States House of Representatives elections in Illinois|congress]], as well as those for state offices.\n\n===Turnout===\nFor the primary elections, turnout was 26.69%, with 1,904,800 votes cast.<ref>{{cite web |title=Voter Turnout |url=https://www.elections.il.gov/ElectionOperations/VoterTurnout.aspx?MID=fVf30XCcBCY%3d&T=637204877664537563 |website=www.elections.il.gov |publisher=Illinois State Board of Elections |accessdate=22 March 2020}}</ref><ref name=\"result\">{{cite web |title=Election Results |url=https://www.elections.il.gov/ElectionOperations/ElectionVoteTotals.aspx |website=www.elections.il.gov |publisher=Illinois State Board of Elections |accessdate=23 March 2020}}</ref> For the general election, turnout was 68.56%, with 5,141,520 votes cast.<ref name=turnoutgen>{{cite web |title=Voter Turnout |url=https://www.elections.il.gov/ElectionOperations/VoterTurnout.aspx?MID=fVf30XCcBCY%3d&T=637204879738085590 |website=www.elections.il.gov |publisher=Illinois State Board of Elections |accessdate=22 March 2020}}</ref><ref name=\"result\"/>\n\n== Democratic primary ==\n\n=== Candidates ===\n==== Declared ====\n* [[Gery Chico]], [[Chicago Public Schools|President of the Chicago Board of Education]]\n* [[Blair Hull]], businessman\n* [[Daniel Hynes]], State Comptroller\n* [[Barack Obama]], State Senator and future [[President of the United States]]\n* [[Maria Pappas]], Cook County Treasurer\n* [[Nancy Skinner (Midwestern politician)|Nancy Skinner]], radio personality\n* Joyce Washington, health care executive\n* Estella Johnson Hunt (write-in)\n\n==== Withdrew ====\n* Matt O'Shea, Mayor of [[Metamora, Illinois]].

[[Incumbent]] Republican U.S. Senator [[Peter Fitzgerald (politician)|Peter Fitzgerald]] decided to retire after one term. The Democratic and Republican [[primary election]]s were held in March, which included a total of 15 candidates who combined to spend a record total of over $60 million seeking the [[open seat]].\n\nOn March 16, 2004, State Senator [[Barack Obama]] won the Democratic primary, and businessman [[Jack Ryan (politician)|Jack Ryan]] won the Republican primary. Three months later, Ryan announced his withdrawal from the race four days after the [[Chicago Tribune]] persuaded a California court to release records from Ryan's divorce case, which included allegations that Ryan had pressured his then-wife actress [[Jeri Ryan]] to perform sexual acts in public.\n\nSix weeks later, the Illinois Republican State Central Committee chose former Diplomat [[Alan Keyes]] to replace Ryan as the Republican candidate. The election was the first for the U.S. Senate in which both major party candidates were [[African American]]. Obama won by 43%, the largest margin of victory in the state history of U.S. Senate elections, and served in the Senate for four years until he was [[2008 United States presidential election|elected President]] in 2008. The inequality in the candidates spending for the fall elections \u2013 $14,244,768 by Obama and $2,545,325 by Keyes \u2013 is also among the largest in history in both [[absolute and relative terms]].<ref>{{Cite book | url=https://archive.org/details/electio_xxx_2006_00_4209/page/195 | last=Jacobson | first=Gary C. | title=The First Congressional Elections After BCRA | work=The Election After Reform: Money, Politics and the Bipartisan Campaign RDUNIAt | publisher=Rowman and Littlefield | isbn=978-0742538702 | page=[https://archive.org/details/electio_xxx_2006_00_4209/page/195 195] | date=March 30, 2006 | accessdate=October 27, 2012 }}</ref>\n\n==Election information==\nThe primaries and general elections coincided with those for [[2004 United States presidential election in Illinois|United States President]] and [[2004 United States House of Representatives elections in Illinois|congress]], as well as those for state offices.\n\n===Turnout===\nFor the primary elections, turnout was 26.69%, with 1,904,800 votes cast.<ref>{{cite web |title=Voter Turnout |url=https://www.elections.il.gov/ElectionOperations/VoterTurnout.aspx?MID=fVf30XCcBCY%3d&T=637204877664537563 |website=www.elections.il.gov |publisher=Illinois State Board of Elections |accessdate=22 March 2020}}</ref><ref name=\"result\">{{cite web |title=Election Results |url=https://www.elections.il.gov/ElectionOperations/ElectionVoteTotals.aspx |website=www.elections.il.gov |publisher=Illinois State Board of Elections |accessdate=23 March 2020}}</ref> For the general election, turnout was 68.56%, with 5,141,520 votes cast.<ref name=turnoutgen>{{cite web |title=Voter Turnout |url=https://www.elections.il.gov/ElectionOperations/VoterTurnout.aspx?MID=fVf30XCcBCY%3d&T=637204879738085590 |website=www.elections.il.gov |publisher=Illinois State Board of Elections |accessdate=22 March 2020}}</ref><ref name=\"result\"/>\n\n== Democratic primary ==\n\n=== Candidates ===\n==== Declared ====\n* [[Gery Chico]], [[Chicago Public Schools|President of the Chicago Board of Education]]\n* [[Blair Hull]], businessman\n* [[Daniel Hynes]], State Comptroller\n* [[Barack Obama]], State Senator and future [[President of the United States]]\n* [[Maria Pappas]], Cook County Treasurer\n* [[Nancy Skinner (Midwestern politician)|Nancy Skinner]], radio personality\n* Joyce Washington, health care executive\n* Estella Johnson Hunt (write-in)\n\n==== Withdrew ====\n* Matt O'Shea, Mayor of [[Metamora, Illinois]].

Obama and Keyes differed on many issues including [[education voucher|school vouchers]] and tax cuts, both of which Keyes supported and Obama opposed.<ref>Alan Keyes Archives, [http://www.keyesarchives.com/debates.htm 2004 Illinois Debates] {{Webarchive | url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070225055002/http://www.keyesarchives.com/debates.htm | date=February 25, 2007 }}</ref>\n\n=== Results ===\n{{Election box begin | title=2004 United States Senate election in Illinois<ref name=\"result\"/><ref name=turnoutgen/>}}\n{{Election box winning candidate with party link\n | party      = Democratic Party (United States)\n | candidate  = [[Barack Obama]]\n | votes      = 3,597,456\n | percentage = 70.0%\n | change     = +22.6%\n}}{{Election box candidate with party link\n | party      = Republican Party (United States)\n | candidate  = [[Alan Keyes]]\n | votes      = 1,390,690\n | percentage = 27.0%\n | change     = -23.3%\n}}\n{{Election box candidate with party link\n | party      = Independent (United States)\n | candidate  = Al Franzen\n | votes      = 81,164\n | percentage = 1.6%\n | change     = \n}}\n{{Election box candidate with party link\n | party      = Libertarian Party (United States)\n | candidate  = Jerry Kohn\n | votes      = 69,253\n | percentage = 1.3%\n | change     = \n}}\n{{Election box candidate\n | party      = Write-ins\n | candidate  = \n | votes      = 2,957\n | percentage = 0.1%\n | change     = \n}}\n{{Election box total\n | votes      = '''5,141,520'''\n | percentage = '''68.6%'''\n | change     = N/A\n}}\n{{Election box gain with party link no swing\n | winner    = Democratic Party (United States)\n | loser     = Republican Party (United States)\n}}\n{{Election box end}}\n\nThe Obama-Keyes race was one of the first to be called on [[Election Day (United States)|Election Day]], November 2, 2004.\n\nAt the start of Keyes' candidacy in August, Keyes had 24% support in the [[opinion poll|polls]].

They form two rows, one on each side. For the purpose of this article, they are listed in the order they are passed when crossing the bridge from the Old Town to the Lesser Quarter, and are divided into two categories: those on the north side of the bridge and those on the south side. The [[Statue of Bruncv\u00edk, Charles Bridge|statue of Bruncv\u00edk]] is also included, although it is not considered one of the principal statues.\n\nDamage caused to the statues over many years has resulted in many of the originals being replaced by copies.\n\n==Statues on the south side of the bridge==\n=== Statue of [[Ivo of Kermartin|St. Ivo]] ===\n{{Main|Statue of Ivo of Kermartin, Charles Bridge}}\n\n(''souso\u0161\u00ed sv.

Barbory, Mark\u00e9ty a Al\u017eb\u011bty'') The statues were sculpted by [[Ferdinand Brokoff]] in 1707. Although there is an inscription saying IOANN BROKOFF FECIT (''made by [[Jan Brokoff]]''), their style is evidence that his son Ferdinand is their true author.\n\n=== Statue of the Lamentation of [[Christ]] ===\n{{Main|Statue of Piet\u00e0, Charles Bridge}}\n\n(''souso\u0161\u00ed Piety'') Designed by [[Emanuel Max]] in 1858, upon commission from the Old Town's public authorities, the statue depicts [[Mary Magdalene]] and the [[Blessed Virgin Mary|Virgin Mary]] mourning the dead Christ. At this position on the bridge, there was originally a wooden crucifix, which was destroyed by a flood in 1496. In 1695, a statue depicting the lamentation of Christ by [[Jan Brokoff]] was installed here; this was removed to the Monastery of Gracious Nurses under Pet\u0159\u00edn hill in Prague in 1859 and replaced by the current statue.\n\n=== Statue of [[Saint Joseph|St. Joseph]] ===\n{{Main|Statue of Saint Joseph, Charles Bridge}}\n\n(''socha sv.

The statue depicts an Indian and a Japanese prince being baptized by the saint, along with a Moor in chains and a Tatar.\n\n=== Statue of [[Saint Christopher|St. Christopher]] ===\n{{Main|Statue of Saint Christopher, Charles Bridge}}\n\n(''socha sv. Kry\u0161tofa'') This statue was designed by Emanuel Max in 1857 and sponsored by V\u00e1clav Wanek, the portreeve of Prague. It depicts the saint holding Christ as a boy on his shoulder. The statue was originally conceived by Count [[Franz Anton von Sporck|Anton\u00edn Sporck]], who wanted to build a marble statue as tribute to [[Charles VI, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles VI]] in 1720. A plan of this was created by Matthias Braun, which was not executed.\n\n=== Statue of [[Francis Borgia|St. Francis Borgia]] ===\n{{Main|Statue of Francis Borgia, Charles Bridge}}\n\n(''souso\u0161\u00ed sv. Franti\u0161ka Borgi\u00e1\u0161e'') This statue was commissioned from Ferdinand Brokoff by the imperial Burgrave Franti\u0161ek z Collet\u016f in 1710.

Ludmily'') The exact date and sculptor responsible for this statue are not known, although it is believed that it was created by Matthias Braun around 1730. The sculpture was erected on the bridge in 1784 to replace the statue of St. Wenceslas damaged in the floods in that year. The statue depicts St. Ludmila teaching her grandson, St. Wenceslas and the base contains a relief sculpture showing the murder of St. Wenceslas.\n\n=== Statue of [[Francis of Assisi|St. Francis of Assisi]] ===\n{{Main|Statue of Francis of Assisi, Charles Bridge}}\n\n(''socha sv. Franti\u0161ka Serafinsk\u00e9ho'') Sculpted by Emanuel Max in 1855, the statue was donated by count [[Franz Anton von Kolowrat-Liebsteinsky|Franti\u0161ek Anton\u00edn Kolowrat Liebsteinsk\u00fd]].

Vincence Ferrarsk\u00e9ho a sv. Prokopa'') One of the most artistically important pieces on the bridge, this statue was sculpted by Ferdinand Brokoff in 1712, paid for by Romedius Josef Franti\u0161ek, the count Thun and lord of Choltice. St. Vincent is on the left, with a coffin and a kneeling penitent sinner by his legs. Saint Procopius of S\u00e1zava stands on a devil to the right.\n\nBeside the statue of Sts. Vincent and Procopius stands a column with a sculpture of Bruncvik, (a mythical Bohemian knight inspired by the Saxonian and Bavarian knight [[Henry the Lion]] from [[Braunschweig|Brunswick]]), portrayed helping a lion fight a seven-headed dragon. This was sculpted by Ludv\u00edk \u0160imek in 1884, and sponsored by the City of Prague. The knight, Bruncv\u00edk, is holding a golden sword, with a lion lying by his legs. This replaced a [[Roland (statue)|statue of Roland]], erected in 1502, and was intended to remind passers-by of the Old Town's privileges to the bridge, in particular the right to charge tolls and duty. It was damaged by cannon fire when [[Battle of Prague (1648)|the city was attacked]] by [[Sweden|Swedish forces]] in 1648.\n\n=== Statue of [[Nicholas of Tolentino|St. Nicholas of Tolentino]] ===\n{{Main|Statue of Nicholas of Tolentino, Charles Bridge}}\n\n(''socha sv.

Vojt\u011bcha'') Designed by [[Michael Brokoff|Michael]] and [[Ferdinand Brokoff]] in 1709, this statue was sponsored by Markus Bernard Joanelli, the councilor of the Old Town of Prague. The saint is represented with a prelate stick developing into a sea paddle and is standing on a base decorated with angels and the emblem of the donor.\n\n=== Statues of Saints [[John of Matha]], [[Felix of Valois]], and [[Saint Ivan|Ivan]] ===\n{{Main|Statues of John of Matha, Felix of Valois and Saint Ivan, Charles Bridge}}\n\n(''souso\u0161\u00ed sv. Jana z Mathy, Felixe z Valois a Ivana'') The most spacious and expensive sculpture on the bridge, this was designed in 1714 by Ferdinand Brokoff and sponsored by Franti\u0161ek Josef Thun, the lord of Kl\u00e1\u0161terec nad Oh\u0159\u00ed. The sculpture was intended to honour the two founders of the Trinitarians, the order that supervised buying back and redeeming of Christians in captivity under Turks. St. Ivan, the saint patron of Slavs was added to the group for unknown reasons. The base depicts a cave in which three chained Christians are praying to the Lord for salvation.\n\n=== Statue of [[Saint Wenceslas|St. Wenceslas]] ===\n{{Main|Statue of Wenceslaus I, Charles Bridge}}\n\n(''socha sv. V\u00e1clava'') This statue was designed by Karel B\u00f6hm in 1858 and was based on the design by Josef Kamil F\u00fchring. The statue was paid for by the Institute of the Blind at Kl\u00e1rov, Prague. Until 1822, various little shops stood on this part of the bridge.\n\n==Statues on the north side of the bridge==\n===Statue of the [[Madonna (art)|Madonna]] attending to [[Bernard of Clairvaux|St. Bernard]]===\n{{Main|Statues of Madonna and Saint Bernard, Charles Bridge}}\n\n(Czech: ''souso\u0161\u00ed Madony se sv. Bernardem'') This statue was sculpted by Mat\u011bj V\u00e1clav J\u00e4ckl in 1709 and donated by the [[abbot]] of the [[Cistercians|Cistercian]] monastery in Osek, Benedikt Littwerig.\n\n===Statue of the [[Madonna (art)|Madonna]], [[Saint Dominic|Ss. Dominic]] and [[Thomas Aquinas]]===\n{{Main|Statues of Madonna, Saint Dominic and Thomas Aquinas, Charles Bridge}}\n\n(''souso\u0161\u00ed Madony se sv. Dominikem a Tom\u00e1\u0161em Akvinsk\u00fdm'') This group was sculpted by Mat\u011bj V\u00e1clav J\u00e4ckel in 1708, and sponsored by the [[Dominican Order|Dominicans]] [[Convent]] of St. Giles in the Old Town of Prague. The statue portrays the Madonna giving the Rosary to St. Dominic on the left, with St. Thomas Aquinas standing to the right.\n\n===The Crucifix and Calvary===\n{{Main|Calvary, Charles Bridge}}\n\n[[Image:St Calvary at Charles Bridge.jpg|upright|right|thumb|Statuary of the Holy Crucifix and Calvary]]\n(''souso\u0161\u00ed K\u0159\u00ed\u017ee s Kalv\u00e1ri\u00ed'') This sculpture is one of the most historically interesting sculptures on the bridge, which gradually gained its present appearance throughout many centuries. The original wooden crucifix was installed at this place soon after 1361 and probably destroyed by the [[Hussites]] in 1419. A new crucifix with a wooden corpus was erected in 1629 but was severely damaged by the [[Sweden|Swedes]] towards the end of the [[Thirty Years' War]]. The remnants of this crucifix can be found in the [[Lapidarium, Prague|lapidarium]] of the National Museum in Prague. This was replaced by another wooden Calvary which, in turn, was replaced with a metal version in 1657. Bought in [[Dresden]], this crucifix was originally made in 1629 by H. Hillger based upon a design by W. E. Brohn. In 1666, two lead figures were added, but these were replaced in 1861 by the present sandstone statues by Emanuel Max, portraying the Virgin Mary and [[John the Evangelist]].\n\nThe golden [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] text on the crucifix was added in 1696 and is a prime example of Medieval European [[anti-Semitism]]. In that year, the Prague authorities accused a local Jewish leader, one Elias Backoffen, of blasphemy. As his punishment he was ordered to raise the funds for purchasing of gold-plated Hebrew letters, placed around the head of the statue, spelling out \"Holy, Holy, Holy, the Lord of Hosts,\" the [[Kedusha]] from the Hebrew prayer and originating in the vision from the Book of Isaiah. The inscription was a symbolic humiliation and degradation of Prague Jews, forcing them to pay for a set of golden letters referring to God and hung around the neck of the statue of Christ (information from Steven Plaut, The \"Vav\" from the Charles Bridge).  A bronze tablet with explanatory text in Czech, English and Hebrew was mounted under the statue by the City of Prague in 2000.  The tablet's placement came after an American Rabbi, Ronald Brown of Temple Beth Am in Merrick, New York was passing over the bridge and noted the possibly offensive nature of the placing of the text.  Upon a direct request to the mayor, the tablet was soon placed to the side of the statue.\n\n===Statue of [[Saint Anne|St. Anne]]===\n{{Main|Statue of Saint Anne, Charles Bridge}}\n\n(''socha sv. Anny'') Designed by Mat\u011bj V\u00e1clav J\u00e4ckel in 1707, at the expense of count Rudolf of Lisov, the hetman of the New Town of Prague, this statue represents St. Anne, mother of the Virgin Mary, who is portrayed here as a young girl.\n\n===Statue of [[St. Cyril and St. Methodius]]===\n{{Main|Statues of Saints Cyril and Methodius, Charles Bridge}}\n\n(''souso\u0161\u00ed sv. Cyrila a Metod\u011bje'') This statue was sculpted by Karel Dvo\u0159\u00e1k between 1928 and 1939 and was erected by the Ministry of education. It portrays the saints Cyril and Methodius ([[missionary|missionaries]] who introduced Christianity to the [[Slavic Peoples|Slavs]]). The original statue of St. Ignatius which stood here, designed by Ferdinand Brokoff in 1711, was displaced by the floods of 1890 and can now be found in the [[Lapidarium, Prague|Prague lapidarium]].\n\n===Statue of St. [[John the Baptist]]===\n{{Main|Statue of John the Baptist, Charles Bridge}}\n\n(''socha sv. Jana K\u0159titele'') Sculpted by Josef Max in 1857, at the expenses of Jan Norbert Gemrich of Neuberk, this statue depicts a standing St. John. This replaces a statue by Jan Brokoff, portraying the Baptism of Jesus by St. John, which stood in this position between 1706 and 1848.\n\n===Statue of Saints [[Norbert of Xanten]], [[Saint Wenceslas|Wenceslas]] and [[Sigismund of Burgundy|Sigismund]]===\n{{Main|Statues of Saints Norbert, Wenceslaus and Sigismund}}\n\n[[Image:Prague-charles bridge-hradcany.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Statue of Saints Norbert of Xanten, Wenceslas and Sigismund on Charles Bridge in Prague]]\n(''souso\u0161\u00ed sv. Norberta, V\u00e1clava a Zikmunda'') This statue was designed by Josef Max in 1853, under the patronage of the abbot of Strahov Monastery, Dr. Jeron\u00fdm Zeidler.\n\n===Statue of [[John of Nepomuk|St. John of Nepomuk]]===\n{{Main|Statue of John of Nepomuk, Charles Bridge}}\n\n[[Image:Prague 07-2016 Charles Bridge John of Nepomuk statue img2.jpg|upright|right|thumb|The [[Statue of John of Nepomuk, Charles Bridge|statue of John of Nepomuk]]]]\n\n(''socha sv. Jana Nepomuck\u00e9ho'') This statue is the oldest on the bridge. The original clay design was made by Austrian sculptor Matthias Rauchm\u00fcller, based upon a wood model by Jan Brokoff. The statue was then cast in bronze by Volfgang Jeron\u00fdm Heroldt in [[Nuremberg]]. The saint is presented in a traditional way, as a bearded capitulary with a five-star glory, standing on a tripartite base. The base portrays scenes from the life of St. John of Nepomuk, including the confession of Queen Johanna and the saint's death. In 1393 St. John of Nepomuk was thrown from the bridge into the river where he drowned. In modern times it has become traditional to [[statue rubbing|touch]] the bridge here; this is held to bring good fortune and to ensure that the visitor will return to the city of Prague.\n\n===Statue of [[Anthony of Padua|St. Anthony of Padua]]===\n{{Main|Statue of Anthony of Padua, Charles Bridge}}\n\n(''socha sv. Anton\u00edna Padu\u00e1nsk\u00e9ho'') Designed by Jan Old\u0159ich Mayer in 1707 and sponsored by Kri\u0161tof Mo\u0159ice Withauer, councilor of the [[Prague Castle]] [[Graf|burgraviate]], this statue represents St. Anthony standing between two vases, holding Jesus.\n\n===Statue of [[Saint Jude|St. Jude Thaddeus]]===\n{{Main|Statue of Jude the Apostle, Charles Bridge}}\n\n(''socha sv.

Kajet\u00e1na'') This statue was sculpted by Ferdinand Brokoff in 1709, and sponsored by the convent of Theatins in Prague.

The statue portrays St. Philip Benitius, fifth general of the Servites, holding a cross, a book and a spray. By his legs there is the crown of the Pope. A clay model of this statue can be found in the [[Salzburg]] museum.\n\n===Statuary of [[Vitus|St. Vitus]]===\n{{Main|Statue of Vitus, Charles Bridge}}\n\n(''socha sv.

St. Vitus is portrayed standing on a base in the shape of cave, from which lions crawl up. The Saint is depicted as a [[Rome|Roman]] aristocrat, martyred for his faith. Duke [[Saint Wenceslas|Wenceslas]] acquired a number of his relics to honor the founding of [[St. Vitus Cathedral]] at Prague Castle. These relics, together with others acquired by [[Charles IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles IV]] in 1355, are embedded in the cathedral building.\n\n===Statue of the Holy Savior with [[Saints Cosmas and Damian|Cosmas and Damian]]===\n{{Main|Statues of Saints Cosmas and Damian, Charles Bridge}}\n\n(''souso\u0161\u00ed sv.

This was sculpted by Ludv\u00edk \u0160imek in 1884, and sponsored by the City of Prague. The knight, Bruncv\u00edk, is holding a golden sword, with a lion lying by his legs. This replaced a [[Roland (statue)|statue of Roland]], erected in 1502, and was intended to remind passers-by of the Old Town's privileges to the bridge, in particular the right to charge tolls and duty. It was damaged by cannon fire when [[Battle of Prague (1648)|the city was attacked]] by [[Sweden|Swedish forces]] in 1648.\n\n=== Statue of [[Nicholas of Tolentino|St. Nicholas of Tolentino]] ===\n{{Main|Statue of Nicholas of Tolentino, Charles Bridge}}\n\n(''socha sv. Mikul\u00e1\u0161e Tolentinsk\u00e9ho'') Sculpted by Jan Bed\u0159ich Kohl in 1708, this statue was paid for by the [[Augustinian order]] convent of St. Thomas in Prague. The saint is portrayed standing on a simple base, together with an angel holding a basket of bread.\n\n=== Statue of [[Luthgard|St. Luthgard]] (Dream of St. Luthgard) ===\n{{Main| Statue of Lutgardis, Charles Bridge}}\n\n(''socha sv. Luitgardy'') Possibly the most valuable piece of art on the bridge, the statue of St. Luthgard was sculpted by Matthias Braun in 1710 as a commission from Ev\u017een Tyttl, the abbot of the [[Cistercian]] monastery in Plasy.\n\n=== Statue of [[Adalbert of Prague|St. Adalbert]] ===\n{{Main|Statue of Adalbert of Prague, Charles Bridge}}\n(''socha sv. Vojt\u011bcha'') Designed by [[Michael Brokoff|Michael]] and [[Ferdinand Brokoff]] in 1709, this statue was sponsored by Markus Bernard Joanelli, the councilor of the Old Town of Prague. The saint is represented with a prelate stick developing into a sea paddle and is standing on a base decorated with angels and the emblem of the donor.\n\n=== Statues of Saints [[John of Matha]], [[Felix of Valois]], and [[Saint Ivan|Ivan]] ===\n{{Main|Statues of John of Matha, Felix of Valois and Saint Ivan, Charles Bridge}}\n\n(''souso\u0161\u00ed sv. Jana z Mathy, Felixe z Valois a Ivana'') The most spacious and expensive sculpture on the bridge, this was designed in 1714 by Ferdinand Brokoff and sponsored by Franti\u0161ek Josef Thun, the lord of Kl\u00e1\u0161terec nad Oh\u0159\u00ed. The sculpture was intended to honour the two founders of the Trinitarians, the order that supervised buying back and redeeming of Christians in captivity under Turks. St. Ivan, the saint patron of Slavs was added to the group for unknown reasons. The base depicts a cave in which three chained Christians are praying to the Lord for salvation.\n\n=== Statue of [[Saint Wenceslas|St. Wenceslas]] ===\n{{Main|Statue of Wenceslaus I, Charles Bridge}}\n\n(''socha sv. V\u00e1clava'') This statue was designed by Karel B\u00f6hm in 1858 and was based on the design by Josef Kamil F\u00fchring. The statue was paid for by the Institute of the Blind at Kl\u00e1rov, Prague. Until 1822, various little shops stood on this part of the bridge.\n\n==Statues on the north side of the bridge==\n===Statue of the [[Madonna (art)|Madonna]] attending to [[Bernard of Clairvaux|St. Bernard]]===\n{{Main|Statues of Madonna and Saint Bernard, Charles Bridge}}\n\n(Czech: ''souso\u0161\u00ed Madony se sv. Bernardem'') This statue was sculpted by Mat\u011bj V\u00e1clav J\u00e4ckl in 1709 and donated by the [[abbot]] of the [[Cistercians|Cistercian]] monastery in Osek, Benedikt Littwerig.\n\n===Statue of the [[Madonna (art)|Madonna]], [[Saint Dominic|Ss. Dominic]] and [[Thomas Aquinas]]===\n{{Main|Statues of Madonna, Saint Dominic and Thomas Aquinas, Charles Bridge}}\n\n(''souso\u0161\u00ed Madony se sv. Dominikem a Tom\u00e1\u0161em Akvinsk\u00fdm'') This group was sculpted by Mat\u011bj V\u00e1clav J\u00e4ckel in 1708, and sponsored by the [[Dominican Order|Dominicans]] [[Convent]] of St. Giles in the Old Town of Prague. The statue portrays the Madonna giving the Rosary to St. Dominic on the left, with St. Thomas Aquinas standing to the right.\n\n===The Crucifix and Calvary===\n{{Main|Calvary, Charles Bridge}}\n\n[[Image:St Calvary at Charles Bridge.jpg|upright|right|thumb|Statuary of the Holy Crucifix and Calvary]]\n(''souso\u0161\u00ed K\u0159\u00ed\u017ee s Kalv\u00e1ri\u00ed'') This sculpture is one of the most historically interesting sculptures on the bridge, which gradually gained its present appearance throughout many centuries. The original wooden crucifix was installed at this place soon after 1361 and probably destroyed by the [[Hussites]] in 1419. A new crucifix with a wooden corpus was erected in 1629 but was severely damaged by the [[Sweden|Swedes]] towards the end of the [[Thirty Years' War]]. The remnants of this crucifix can be found in the [[Lapidarium, Prague|lapidarium]] of the National Museum in Prague. This was replaced by another wooden Calvary which, in turn, was replaced with a metal version in 1657. Bought in [[Dresden]], this crucifix was originally made in 1629 by H. Hillger based upon a design by W. E. Brohn. In 1666, two lead figures were added, but these were replaced in 1861 by the present sandstone statues by Emanuel Max, portraying the Virgin Mary and [[John the Evangelist]]. \n\nThe golden [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] text on the crucifix was added in 1696 and is a prime example of Medieval European [[anti-Semitism]]. In that year, the Prague authorities accused a local Jewish leader, one Elias Backoffen, of blasphemy. As his punishment he was ordered to raise the funds for purchasing of gold-plated Hebrew letters, placed around the head of the statue, spelling out \"Holy, Holy, Holy, the Lord of Hosts,\" the [[Kedusha]] from the Hebrew prayer and originating in the vision from the Book of Isaiah. The inscription was a symbolic humiliation and degradation of Prague Jews, forcing them to pay for a set of golden letters referring to God and hung around the neck of the statue of Christ (information from Steven Plaut, The \"Vav\" from the Charles Bridge).  A bronze tablet with explanatory text in Czech, English and Hebrew was mounted under the statue by the City of Prague in 2000.  The tablet's placement came after an American Rabbi, Ronald Brown of Temple Beth Am in Merrick, New York was passing over the bridge and noted the possibly offensive nature of the placing of the text.  Upon a direct request to the mayor, the tablet was soon placed to the side of the statue.\n\n===Statue of [[Saint Anne|St. Anne]]===\n{{Main|Statue of Saint Anne, Charles Bridge}}\n\n(''socha sv. Anny'') Designed by Mat\u011bj V\u00e1clav J\u00e4ckel in 1707, at the expense of count Rudolf of Lisov, the hetman of the New Town of Prague, this statue represents St. Anne, mother of the Virgin Mary, who is portrayed here as a young girl.\n\n===Statue of [[St. Cyril and St. Methodius]]===\n{{Main|Statues of Saints Cyril and Methodius, Charles Bridge}}\n\n(''souso\u0161\u00ed sv. Cyrila a Metod\u011bje'') This statue was sculpted by Karel Dvo\u0159\u00e1k between 1928 and 1939 and was erected by the Ministry of education. It portrays the saints Cyril and Methodius ([[missionary|missionaries]] who introduced Christianity to the [[Slavic Peoples|Slavs]]). The original statue of St. Ignatius which stood here, designed by Ferdinand Brokoff in 1711, was displaced by the floods of 1890 and can now be found in the [[Lapidarium, Prague|Prague lapidarium]].\n\n===Statue of St. [[John the Baptist]]===\n{{Main|Statue of John the Baptist, Charles Bridge}}\n\n(''socha sv. Jana K\u0159titele'') Sculpted by Josef Max in 1857, at the expenses of Jan Norbert Gemrich of Neuberk, this statue depicts a standing St. John. This replaces a statue by Jan Brokoff, portraying the Baptism of Jesus by St. John, which stood in this position between 1706 and 1848.\n\n===Statue of Saints [[Norbert of Xanten]], [[Saint Wenceslas|Wenceslas]] and [[Sigismund of Burgundy|Sigismund]]===\n{{Main|Statues of Saints Norbert, Wenceslaus and Sigismund}}\n\n[[Image:Prague-charles bridge-hradcany.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Statue of Saints Norbert of Xanten, Wenceslas and Sigismund on Charles Bridge in Prague]]\n(''souso\u0161\u00ed sv.

Jana Nepomuck\u00e9ho'') This statue is the oldest on the bridge. The original clay design was made by Austrian sculptor Matthias Rauchm\u00fcller, based upon a wood model by Jan Brokoff. The statue was then cast in bronze by Volfgang Jeron\u00fdm Heroldt in [[Nuremberg]]. The saint is presented in a traditional way, as a bearded capitulary with a five-star glory, standing on a tripartite base. The base portrays scenes from the life of St. John of Nepomuk, including the confession of Queen Johanna and the saint's death. In 1393 St. John of Nepomuk was thrown from the bridge into the river where he drowned. In modern times it has become traditional to [[statue rubbing|touch]] the bridge here; this is held to bring good fortune and to ensure that the visitor will return to the city of Prague.\n\n===Statue of [[Anthony of Padua|St. Anthony of Padua]]===\n{{Main|Statue of Anthony of Padua, Charles Bridge}}\n\n(''socha sv. Anton\u00edna Padu\u00e1nsk\u00e9ho'') Designed by Jan Old\u0159ich Mayer in 1707 and sponsored by Kri\u0161tof Mo\u0159ice Withauer, councilor of the [[Prague Castle]] [[Graf|burgraviate]], this statue represents St. Anthony standing between two vases, holding Jesus.\n\n===Statue of [[Saint Jude|St. Jude Thaddeus]]===\n{{Main|Statue of Jude the Apostle, Charles Bridge}}\n\n(''socha sv.

Kajet\u00e1na'') This statue was sculpted by Ferdinand Brokoff in 1709, and sponsored by the convent of Theatins in Prague.

A clay model of this statue can be found in the [[Salzburg]] museum.\n\n===Statuary of [[Vitus|St. Vitus]]===\n{{Main|Statue of Vitus, Charles Bridge}}\n\n(''socha sv.

St. Vitus is portrayed standing on a base in the shape of cave, from which lions crawl up. The Saint is depicted as a [[Rome|Roman]] aristocrat, martyred for his faith. Duke [[Saint Wenceslas|Wenceslas]] acquired a number of his relics to honor the founding of [[St. Vitus Cathedral]] at Prague Castle. These relics, together with others acquired by [[Charles IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles IV]] in 1355, are embedded in the cathedral building.\n\n===Statue of the Holy Savior with [[Saints Cosmas and Damian|Cosmas and Damian]]===\n{{Main|Statues of Saints Cosmas and Damian, Charles Bridge}}\n\n(''souso\u0161\u00ed sv.
