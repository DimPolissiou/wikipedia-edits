Following the 9/11 terrorist attacks, and subsequent other terrorism related activities by Islamic groups, Sikhs have often been mistaken as Muslims or Arabs, and have been subject to several [[Hate crimes in the United States|hate crimes]], including murders.

Some time later Trussell and Ward became friends and Ward suggested to Trussell to turn his podcast into an animated series. According to Ward, Trussell had the ability to make 2 hours of a meditation conversation funny. Trussell says: \"He reached out to me and said he had an idea for how to animate my podcast, which was another big thrill for me.\"<ref name=\"Inverse\">{{cite web |last1=Kleinman |first1=Jake |title='Midnight Gospel' Was Seven Years In The Making.

In 2018, Ward approached to him again to show a rough concept taking a podcast conversation about drug addiction and playing it over an animatronic of Trussell and his guest fighting off a zombie invasion.<ref name=\"Inverse\"/>\n\nLater, the rough of concept ended up being incorporated into the pilot of the series. The two took the concept of the series in pitching form to Mike Moon, head of adult animations at Netflix. In 2019, Netflix has ordered eight episodes, which is slated to premiere in sometime in 2020.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://deadline.com/2019/12/netflix-order-adult-animated-series-the-midnight-gospel-from-pendleton-ward-duncan-trussell-1202814276/|title=Netflix Orders Adult Animated Series \u2018The Midnight Gospel\u2019 From Pendleton Ward & Duncan Trussell|publisher=[[Deadline Hollywood|Deadline]]|first1=Denise|last1=Petski|accessdate=April 20, 2020|date=December 19, 2019}}</ref> After gaining the green light, the two gathered a team of comedians like [[Johnny Pemberton]], Brendon Walsh, [[\"Weird Al\" Yankovic]] and [[Emo Philips]] were joined by occult scholar Jason Louv and white witch Maja D\u2019Aoust.

The team behind the show are composed by Jesse Moynihan (art director), Antonio Canobbio (Chief Creative Officer for Titmouse), Mike Roush (animation director) and Joey Adams (storyboard supervisor). Mayfield said that the time needed to \"try something nine different ways before one little change would make it go from clunky to incredible.\"<ref name=\"AnMag\"/>\n\nFor Ward, the new series was a chance to explore the brave, new world of making animation for grown-ups. Until then he had made animations for children only and the new show would be a chance to change his way of making animations using the ultra-violence of cartoons with conversations on compassion. Ward also allowed Trussell to include his own original music in several episodes. The show's title came from the good news sense of the word gospel. Trussell says \"\u2019Gospel\u2019 means good news, and I was hoping that we convey the message that even through the most catastrophic situations, when everything is falling part, there is opportunity to grow as a person.\u201d<ref name=\"AnMag\"/>\n\n===Marketing===\nThe first teaser was released on March 16, and the main trailer on April 6. \n\n==Release==\nThe eight-episode first season, ordered by Netflix, was released on April 20, 2020.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.indiewire.com/2020/04/the-midnight-gospel-review-1202224481/|title=\u2018The Midnight Gospel\u2019 Review: \u2018Adventure Time\u2019 Creator\u2019s Astonishing New Netflix Show|publisher=[[IndieWire]]|first1=Eric|last1=Kohn|date=April 14, 2020|accessdate=April 20, 2020}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==See also==\n* [[The Ricky Gervais Show (TV series)]]\n\n==External links==\n* {{IMDb title|11639414}}\n\n{{Netflix original current series}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Midnight Gospel}}\n[[Category:2020 American television series debuts]]\n[[Category:2020s animated television series]]\n[[Category:American adult animated adventure television series]]\n[[Category:English-language television programs]]\n[[Category:Netflix original programming]]\n[[Category:Surrealist television series]]\n[[Category:Television series by Netflix Animation]]\n[[Category:Television series created by Pendleton Ward]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox television\n| show_name                = The Midnight Gospel\n| image                    = File:The Midnight Gospel promotional poster.jpg\n| caption                  = Promotional poster\n| genre                    = {{Plainlist|\n* [[Adult animation]]\n* [[Dark comedy]]\n* [[Science fantasy]]\n* [[Adventure fiction|Adventure]]\n* [[Interview]]\n}}\n| director                 = Pendleton Ward\n| creator                  = {{Plainlist|\n* [[Pendleton Ward]]\n* [[Duncan Trussell]]\n}}\n| voices                   = {{Plainlist|\n* Duncan Trussell\n* [[Phil Hendrie]]\n}}\n| theme_music_composer     = \n| opentheme                = \n| endtheme                 = \n| composer                 = [[Joe Wong (musician)|Joe Wong]]\n| country                  = United States\n| language                 = English\n| num_seasons              = 1\n| num_episodes             = 8\n| list_episodes            = \n| executive_producer       = {{Plainlist|\n* Pendleton Ward\n* Duncan Trussell\n* Antonio Canobbio\n* Ben Kalina\n* Chris Prynoski\n}}\n| producer                 = {{Plainlist|\n* Shannon Prynoski\n* Tony Salama\n}}\n| editor                   = Megan Love\n| cinematography           = \n| runtime                  = 20-36 minutes\n| company                  = [[Titmouse, Inc.]]\n| distributor              = \n| channel                  = [[Netflix]]\n| picture_format           = [[4K resolution|4K]] ([[Ultra-high-definition television|Ultra HD]])<br>[[High-dynamic-range video|High dynamic range]]\n| audio_format             = [[Stereophonic sound|Stereo]]\n| first_aired              = {{Start date|2020|4|20}}\n| last_aired               = present\n| website                  = https://www.netflix.com/title/80987903\n}}\n\n'''''The Midnight Gospel''''' is an [[American]] [[adult animated]] web television series created by ''[[Adventure Time]]''{{'s}} [[Pendleton Ward]] and comedian [[Duncan Trussell]].

Some time later Trussell and Ward became friends and Ward suggested to Trussell to turn his podcast into an animated series. According to Ward, Trussell had the ability to make 2 hours of a meditation conversation funny. Trussell says: \"He reached out to me and said he had an idea for how to animate my podcast, which was another big thrill for me.\"<ref name=\"Inverse\">{{cite web |last1=Kleinman |first1=Jake |title='Midnight Gospel' Was Seven Years In The Making.

In 2018, Ward approached to him again to show a rough concept taking a podcast conversation about drug addiction and playing it over an animatronic of Trussell and his guest fighting off a zombie invasion.<ref name=\"Inverse\"/>\n\nLater, the rough of concept ended up being incorporated into the pilot of the series. The two took the concept of the series in pitching form to Mike Moon, head of adult animations at Netflix. In 2019, Netflix has ordered eight episodes, which is slated to premiere in sometime in 2020.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://deadline.com/2019/12/netflix-order-adult-animated-series-the-midnight-gospel-from-pendleton-ward-duncan-trussell-1202814276/|title=Netflix Orders Adult Animated Series \u2018The Midnight Gospel\u2019 From Pendleton Ward & Duncan Trussell|publisher=[[Deadline Hollywood|Deadline]]|first1=Denise|last1=Petski|accessdate=April 20, 2020|date=December 19, 2019}}</ref> After gaining the green light, the two gathered a team of comedians like [[Johnny Pemberton]], Brendon Walsh, [[\"Weird Al\" Yankovic]] and [[Emo Philips]] were joined by occult scholar Jason Louv and white witch Maja D\u2019Aoust.

The team behind the show are composed by Jesse Moynihan (art director), Antonio Canobbio (Chief Creative Officer for Titmouse), Mike Roush (animation director) and Joey Adams (storyboard supervisor). Mayfield said that the time needed to \"try something nine different ways before one little change would make it go from clunky to incredible.\"<ref name=\"AnMag\"/>\n\nFor Ward, the new series was a chance to explore the brave, new world of making animation for grown-ups. Until then he had made animations for children only and the new show would be a chance to change his way of making animations using the ultra-violence of cartoons with conversations on compassion. Ward also allowed Trussell to include his own original music in several episodes. The show's title came from the good news sense of the word gospel. Trussell says \"\u2019Gospel\u2019 means good news, and I was hoping that we convey the message that even through the most catastrophic situations, when everything is falling part, there is opportunity to grow as a person.\u201d<ref name=\"AnMag\"/>\n\n===Marketing===\nThe first teaser was released on March 16, and the main trailer on April 6. \n\n==Release==\nThe eight-episode first season, ordered by Netflix, was released on April 20, 2020.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.indiewire.com/2020/04/the-midnight-gospel-review-1202224481/|title=\u2018The Midnight Gospel\u2019 Review: \u2018Adventure Time\u2019 Creator\u2019s Astonishing New Netflix Show|publisher=[[IndieWire]]|first1=Eric|last1=Kohn|date=April 14, 2020|accessdate=April 20, 2020}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{IMDb title|11639414}}\n\n{{Netflix original current series}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Midnight Gospel}}\n[[Category:2020 American television series debuts]]\n[[Category:2020s animated television series]]\n[[Category:American adult animated adventure television series]]\n[[Category:English-language television programs]]\n[[Category:Netflix original programming]]\n[[Category:Surrealist television series]]\n[[Category:Television series by Netflix Animation]]\n[[Category:Television series created by Pendleton Ward]]\n", "name_user": "173.187.227.40", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Midnight_Gospel"}

Watercolors can also be made opaque by adding [[Chinese white]].\n\nIn East Asia, watercolor painting with inks is referred to as [[brush painting]] or scroll painting. In [[Chinese painting|Chinese]], [[Korean painting|Korean]] and [[Japanese painting]] it has been the dominant medium, often in monochrome black or browns, often using [[inkstick]] or other pigments. India, Ethiopia and other countries have long watercolor painting traditions as well.\n\nAmerican artists in the early 19th century seemed to regard watercolor primarily as a sketching tool in preparation for the \"finished\" work in oil or engraving.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.collectorsguide.com/fa/fa043.shtml|title=THE COLLECTOR\u2019S GUIDE: WHAT IS WATERCOLOR?|website=www.collectorsguide.com}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n\nWatercolor painting is extremely old, dating perhaps to the cave paintings of paleolithic Europe, and has been used for [[illustrated manuscript|manuscript illustration]] since at least [[ancient Egypt|Egyptian times]] but especially in the [[Middle Ages|European Middle Ages]]. However, its ''continuous'' history as an art medium begins with [[the Renaissance]]. The German [[Northern Renaissance]] artist [[Albrecht D\u00fcrer]] (1471\u20131528), who painted several fine botanical, wildlife, and landscape watercolors, is generally considered among the earliest exponents of watercolor. An important school of watercolor painting in Germany was led by [[Hans Bol]] (1534\u20131593) as part of the [[D\u00fcrer Renaissance]].\n\n[[File:Albrecht D\u00fcrer - Hare, 1502 - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|left|[[Albrecht D\u00fcrer]], ''[[Young Hare]]'', 1502, watercolor and [[body color]], [[Albertina, Vienna]]|alt=A painting of a hare with large ears.]]\n \nDespite this early start, watercolors were generally used by Baroque easel painters only for sketches, copies or [[modello|cartoons]] (full-scale design drawings). Notable early practitioners of watercolor painting were [[Anthony van Dyck|Van Dyck]] (during his stay in England), [[Claude Lorrain]], [[Giovanni Benedetto Castiglione]], and many [[Dutch (ethnic group)|Dutch]] and [[Flemish people|Flemish]] artists. However, [[botanical illustration]] and wildlife illustration perhaps form the oldest and most important traditions in watercolor painting. Botanical illustrations became popular during the Renaissance, both as hand-tinted [[woodcut|woodblock]] illustrations in books or broadsheets and as tinted ink drawings on [[vellum]] or paper. Botanical artists have traditionally been some of the most exacting and accomplished watercolor painters, and even today, watercolors\u2014with their unique ability to summarize, clarify, and idealize in full color\u2014are used to illustrate scientific and museum publications. Wildlife illustration reached its peak in the 19th century with artists such as [[John James Audubon]], and today many naturalist [[field guide]]s are still illustrated with watercolor paintings.\n\n===English school===\n\nSeveral factors contributed to the spread of watercolor painting during the 18th century, particularly in England. Among the elite and aristocratic classes, watercolor painting was one of the incidental adornments of a good education; mapmakers, military officers, and engineers used it for its usefulness in depicting properties, terrain, fortifications, field geology, and for illustrating public works or commissioned projects. Watercolor artists were commonly brought with the geological or archaeological expeditions, funded by the [[Society of Dilettanti]] (founded in 1733), to document discoveries in the Mediterranean, Asia, and the New World. These expeditions stimulated the demand for topographical painters, who churned out memento paintings of famous sites (and sights) along the [[Grand Tour|Grand Tour to Italy]] that was undertaken by every fashionable young man of the time.\n\nIn the late 18th century, the English cleric [[William Gilpin (clergyman)|William Gilpin]] wrote a series of hugely popular books describing his [[picturesque]] journeys throughout rural England, and illustrated them with self-made sentimentalized monochrome watercolors of river valleys, ancient castles, and abandoned churches. This example popularized watercolors as a form of personal tourist journal. The confluence of these cultural, engineering, scientific, tourist, and amateur interests culminated in the celebration and promotion of watercolor as a distinctly English \"national art\". [[William Blake]] published several books of hand-tinted engraved poetry, provided illustrations to [[Dante's Inferno|Dante's ''Inferno'']], and he also experimented with large [[monotype]] works in watercolor. Among the many other significant watercolorists of this period were [[Thomas Gainsborough]], [[John Robert Cozens]], [[Francis Towne]], [[Michael Angelo Rooker]], [[William Pars]], [[Thomas Hearne (artist)|Thomas Hearne]], and [[John Warwick Smith]].\n\n[[File:Thomas Girtin 006.JPG|thumb|[[Thomas Girtin]], ''[[Jedburgh Abbey]] from the River'', 1798\u201399, watercolor on paper]]\n \nFrom the late 18th century through the 19th century, the market for printed books and domestic art contributed substantially to the growth of the medium. Watercolors were used as the basic document from which collectible landscape or tourist engravings were developed, and hand-painted watercolor originals or copies of famous paintings contributed to many upper class art portfolios. Satirical broadsides by [[Thomas Rowlandson]], many published by [[Rudolph Ackermann]], were also extremely popular.\n \nThe three English artists credited with establishing watercolor as an independent, mature painting medium are [[Paul Sandby]] (1730\u20131809), often called the \"father of the English watercolor\"; [[Thomas Girtin]] (1775\u20131802), who pioneered its use for large format, romantic or picturesque landscape painting; and [[Joseph Mallord William Turner]] (1775\u20131851), who brought watercolor painting to the highest pitch of power and refinement, and created hundreds of superb historical, topographical, architectural, and mythological watercolor paintings. His method of developing the watercolor painting in stages, starting with large, vague color areas established on wet paper, then refining the image through a sequence of [[wash (visual arts)|washes]] and glazes, permitted him to produce large numbers of paintings with \"workshop efficiency\" and made him a multimillionaire, partly by sales from his personal art gallery, the first of its kind. Among the important and highly talented contemporaries of Turner and Girtin were [[John Varley (painter)|John Varley]], [[John Sell Cotman]], [[Copley Fielding|Anthony Copley Fielding]], [[Samuel Palmer]], [[William Havell]], and [[Samuel Prout]]. The Swiss painter [[Abraham-Louis-Rodolphe Ducros]] was also widely known for his large format, romantic paintings in watercolor.\n\n[[File:Jamaica hut4.jpg|thumb|left|An unfinished watercolor by [[William Berryman]], created between 1808 and 1816, using watercolor, ink, and pencil. The use of partial pigmentation draws attention to the central subject.]]\n\nThe confluence of amateur activity, publishing markets, middle class [[art collecting]], and 19th-century technique led to the formation of English watercolor painting societies: the ''Society of Painters in Water Colours'' (1804, now known as the [[Royal Watercolour Society]]) and the ''New Water Colour Society'' (1832, now known as the [[Royal Institute of Painters in Water Colours]]). (A ''Scottish Society of Painters in Water Colour'' was founded in 1878, now known as the [[Royal Scottish Society of Painters in Watercolour]].) These societies provided annual exhibitions and buyer referrals for many artists. They also engaged in petty status rivalries and aesthetic debates, particularly between advocates of traditional (\"transparent\") watercolor and the early adopters of the denser color possible with [[gouache|body color or gouache]] (\"opaque\" watercolor). The late Georgian and Victorian periods produced the zenith of the British watercolor, among the most impressive 19th-century works on paper,<ref>{{Citation | first = Graham | last = Reynolds | title = Watercolours, A Concise History | place = London | publisher = [[Thames and Hudson]] | year = 1992 | page = 102}}</ref> due to artists Turner, Varley, Cotman, [[David Cox (artist)|David Cox]], [[Peter de Wint]], [[William Henry Hunt (painter)|William Henry Hunt]], [[John Frederick Lewis]], [[Myles Birket Foster]], [[Frederick Walker (painter)|Frederick Walker]], [[Thomas Collier]], [[Arthur Melville]] and many others. In particular, the graceful, lapidary, and atmospheric watercolors (\"genre paintings\") by [[Richard Parkes Bonington]] created an international fad for watercolor painting, especially in England and France in the 1820s.\n \nThe popularity of watercolors stimulated many innovations, including heavier and more [[sizing|sized]] [[wove paper]]s, and brushes (called \"pencils\") manufactured expressly for watercolor. Watercolor tutorials were first published in this period by Varley, Cox, and others, establishing the step-by-step painting instructions that still characterize the genre today; ''The Elements of Drawing'', a watercolor tutorial by English art critic [[John Ruskin]], has been out of print only once since it was first published in 1857. Commercial brands of watercolor were marketed and paints were packaged in metal tubes or as dry cakes that could be \"rubbed out\" (dissolved) in studio porcelain or used in portable metal paint boxes in the field. Breakthroughs in chemistry made many new pigments available, including synthetic [[ultramarine blue]], [[cobalt blue]], [[viridian]], [[cobalt violet]], [[cadmium yellow]], [[aureolin]] ([[potassium cobaltinitrite]]), [[zinc white]], and a wide range of [[carmine]] and [[madder lake]]s. These pigments, in turn, stimulated a greater use of color with all painting media, but in English watercolors, particularly by the [[Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood]].\n\n[[File:The Blue Boat 1892 Winslow Homer.jpg|thumb|right|[[Winslow Homer]], ''The Blue Boat'', 1892]]\n\n====United States====\n[[File:Brooklyn Museum - White Ships - John Singer Sargent.jpg|thumb|right|John Singer Sargent, ''White Ships''. [[Brooklyn Museum]]]]\nWatercolor painting also became popular in the United States during the 19th century; outstanding early practitioners included [[John James Audubon]], as well as early [[Hudson River School]] painters such as [[William H. Bartlett]] and [[George Harvey (painter)|George Harvey]]. By mid-century, the influence of John Ruskin led to increasing interest in watercolors, particularly the use of a detailed \"Ruskinian\" style by such artists as John W. Hill Henry, [[William Trost Richards]], [[Roderick Newman]], and [[Fidelia Bridges]]. The ''American Society of Painters in Watercolor'' (now the [[American Watercolor Society]]) was founded in 1866. Late-19th-century American exponents of the medium included [[Thomas Moran]], [[Thomas Eakins]], [[John LaFarge]], [[John Singer Sargent]], [[Childe Hassam]], and, preeminently, [[Winslow Homer]].\n\n===Europe===\n[[File:Stanis\u0142aw Mas\u0142owski (1853-1926), Autumn landscape in Rybiniszki, 1902.jpeg|thumb|right|[[Stanis\u0142aw Mas\u0142owski]], ''Pejza\u017c jesienny z Rybiniszek'' (Autumn landscape of [[Riebi\u0146i|Rybiniszki]]), watercolor, 1902]]\nWatercolor was less popular in Continental Europe. In the 18th century, [[gouache]] was an important medium for the Italian artists [[Marco Ricci]] and [[Francesco Zuccarelli]], whose landscape paintings were widely collected.<ref>Brown, David Blayney. \"Watercolour.\" ''Grove Art Online. Oxford Art Online''. Oxford University Press. Retrieved April 26, 2014.</ref> Gouache was used by a number of artists in France as well. In the 19th century, the influence of the English school helped popularize \"transparent\" watercolor in France, and it became an important medium for [[Eug\u00e8ne Delacroix]], [[Fran\u00e7ois Marius Granet]], [[Henri-Joseph Harpignies]], and the satirist [[Honor\u00e9 Daumier]]. Other European painters who worked frequently in watercolor were [[Adolph Menzel]] in Germany and [[Stanis\u0142aw Mas\u0142owski]] in Poland.\n\n[[File:Paul C\u00e9zanne 151.jpg|thumb|[[Paul C\u00e9zanne]], self-portrait]]\nUnfortunately, the careless and excessive adoption of brightly colored, petroleum-derived aniline dyes (and pigments compounded from them), which all fade rapidly on exposure to light, and the efforts to properly conserve the twenty thousand [[J. M. W. Turner]] paintings inherited by the British Museum in 1857, led to an examination and negative reevaluation of the permanence of pigments in watercolor.{{Citation needed|date=October 2015}} This caused a sharp decline in their status and market value. Nevertheless, isolated practitioners continued to prefer and develop the medium into the 20th century. Gorgeous landscape and maritime watercolors were done by [[Paul Signac]], and [[Paul C\u00e9zanne]] developed a watercolor painting style consisting entirely of overlapping small glazes of pure color.\n\n===20th and 21st centuries===\nAmong the many 20th-century artists who produced important works in watercolor, [[Wassily Kandinsky]], [[Emil Nolde]], [[Paul Klee]], [[Egon Schiele]], and [[Raoul Dufy]] must be mentioned. In America, the major exponents included [[Charles Burchfield]], [[Edward Hopper]], [[Georgia O'Keeffe]], [[Charles Demuth]], and [[John Marin]] (80% of his total work is watercolor). In this period, American watercolor painting often imitated European Impressionism and Post-Impressionism, but significant individualism flourished in \"regional\" styles of watercolor painting from the 1920s to 1940s. In particular, the \"[[Cleveland School (arts community)|Cleveland School]]\" or \"Ohio School\" of painters centered around the [[Cleveland Museum of Art]], and the [[California Scene Painting|California Scene]] painters were often associated with Hollywood animation studios or the [[Chouinard Art Institute]] (now [[California Institute of the Arts]]). The California painters exploited their state's varied geography, Mediterranean climate, and \"[[Car culture|automobility]]\" to reinvigorate the outdoor or \"plein air\" tradition. The most influential among them were [[Phil Dike]], [[Millard Sheets]], [[Rex Brandt]], [[Dong Kingman]], and [[Milford Zornes]]. The California Water Color Society, founded in 1921 and later renamed the National Watercolor Society, sponsored important exhibitions of their work. The largest watercolor in the world at the moment is ''Building 6 Portrait: Interior.''<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.smithsonianmag.com/travel/story-behind-worlds-largest-known-watercolor-painting-180963798/|title=The Story Behind the World\u2019s Largest Watercolor Painting|last=Nalewicki|first=Jennifer|work=Smithsonian|access-date=2018-07-01|language=en}}</ref> Produced by American artist Barbara Ernst Prey on commission for MASS MoCA,<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://creators.vice.com/en_us/article/8x4w54/mass-moca-worlds-largest-watercolor|title=The World's Largest Watercolor Goes on Display at MASS MoCA|date=2017-05-30|work=Creators|access-date=2018-07-01|language=en-us}}</ref> the work can be seen at MASS MoCA's Robert W.

In Spain, [[Cefer\u00ed Oliv\u00e9]] created an innovative style followed by his students, such as [[Rafael Alonso L\u00f3pez-Montero]] and [[Francesc Torn\u00e9 Gavald\u00e0]]. In [[Mexico]], the major exponents are [[Ignacio Barrios]], [[Edgardo Coghlan]], [[\u00c1ngel Mauro]], [[Vicente Mendiola]], and [[Pastor Vel\u00e1zquez]]. In the [[Canary Islands]], where this pictorial technique has many followers, there are stand-out artists such as Francisco Bonn\u00edn Guer\u00edn, [[Jos\u00e9 Comas Quesada]], and Alberto Manrique.\n\n==Watercolor paint==\n[[File:Watercolours.jpg|thumb|A set of watercolors]]\n\nWatercolor paint consists of four principal ingredients: a [[pigment]]; [[gum arabic]] as a binder to hold the pigment in suspension; additives like [[glycerin]], [[ox gall]], [[honey]], and preservatives to alter the viscosity, hiding, durability or color of the pigment and vehicle mixture; and evaporating water, as a solvent used to thin or dilute the paint for application.\n\nThe more general term ''[[watermedia]]'' refers to any painting medium that uses water as a solvent and that can be applied with a [[brush]], [[pen]], or sprayer. This includes most [[ink]]s, [[watercolor]]s, [[tempera]]s, [[casein paint|casein]]s, [[gouache]]s, and modern [[acrylic paint]]s.\n\nThe term \"watercolor\" refers to paints that use water-soluble, complex carbohydrates as a binder. Originally (in the 16th to 18th centuries), watercolor binders were sugars and/or hide glues, but since the 19th century, the preferred binder is natural [[gum arabic]], with [[glycerin]] and/or [[honey]] as additives to improve plasticity and solubility of the binder, and with other chemicals added to improve product shelf life.\n\nThe term \"[[bodycolor]]\" refers to paint that is opaque rather than transparent. It usually refers to opaque watercolor, known as [[gouache]].<ref>The Oxford Dictionary of Art and Artists, Ian Chilvers, Oxford University Press USA, 2009</ref> Modern acrylic paints use an [[acrylic resin]] dispersion as a binder.\n\n===Innovative Methods===\nIn 1972 Hratch Israelian invented a new Painting Process and a new water-base paint. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SNAQsM9MYf4 \n\n===Commercial watercolors===\nWatercolor painters before the turn of the 18th century had to make paints themselves using pigments purchased from an [[apothecary]] or specialized \"colorman\", and mixing them with gum arabic or some other binder. The earliest commercial paints were small, resinous blocks that had to be wetted and laboriously \"rubbed out\" in water to obtain a usable color intensity. [[William Reeves (colourman)|William Reeves]] started his business as a colorman around 1766. In 1781, he and his brother, Thomas Reeves, were awarded the Silver Palette of the [[Society of Arts]], for the invention of the moist watercolor ''paint-cake'', a time-saving convenience, introduced in the \"golden age\" of English watercolor painting. The \"cake\" was immediately soluble when touched by a wet brush.\n[[File:Watercolors by William Reeves, London, inventor of watercolors in cakes, undated - Joseph Allen Skinner Museum - DSC07847.JPG|left|thumb|upright|A Reeves box]]\nModern commercial watercolor paints are available in two forms: tubes or pans. The majority of paints sold today are in collapsible small metal tubes in standard sizes and formulated to a consistency similar to toothpaste by being already mixed with a certain water component. For use, this paste has to be further diluted with water. Pan paints (actually small dried cakes or bars of paint in an open plastic container) are usually sold in two sizes, full pans and half pans.\n\nOwing to modern [[Industrial technology|industrial]] [[organic chemistry]], the variety, [[colorfulness|saturation]], and permanence of artists' colors available today has been vastly improved. Correct and non-toxic [[primary colors]] are now present through the introduction of [[hansa yellow]], [[phthalo blue]] and [[quinacridone]] (PV 122). From such a set of three colors, in principle all others can be mixed, as in a classical technique no white is used. The modern development of pigments was not driven by artistic demand. The [[art materials]] industry is too small to exert any market leverage on global dye or pigment manufacture. With rare exceptions such as aureolin, all modern watercolor paints utilize pigments that have a wider industrial use. Paint manufacturers buy, by industrial standards very small, supplies of these pigments, [[Mill (grinding)|mill]] them with the vehicle, solvent, and additives, and package them. The milling process with inorganic pigments, in more expensive brands, reduces the particle size to improve the color flow when the paint is applied with water.\n\n===Transparency===\nIn the partisan debates of the 19th-century English art world, gouache was emphatically contrasted to traditional watercolors and denigrated for its high hiding power or lack of \"transparency\"; \"transparent\" watercolors were exalted. The aversion to opaque paint had its origin in the fact that well into the 19th century [[lead white]] was used to increase the covering quality. That pigment tended to soon discolor into black under the influence of sulphurous air pollution, totally ruining the artwork.<ref>D. Kraaijpoel & C. Herenius. (2007) ''Het kunstschilderboek \u2014 handboek voor materialen en technieken'', Cantecleer, p. 187</ref> The traditional claim that \"transparent\" watercolors gain \"luminosity\" because they function like a pane of stained glass laid on paper\u2014the color intensified because the light passes through the pigment, reflects from the paper, and passes a second time through the pigment on its way to the viewer\u2014is false. Watercolor paints typically do not form a cohesive paint layer, as do acrylic or [[oil paint|oil]] paints, but simply scatter pigment particles randomly across the [[paper]] surface; the transparency is caused by the paper being visible between the particles.<ref name=\"Kraaijpoel2007\">D. Kraaijpoel & C. Herenius. (2007) ''Het kunstschilderboek \u2014 handboek voor materialen en technieken'', Cantecleer, p. 183</ref> Watercolors may appear more vivid than acrylics or oils because the pigments are laid down in a purer form, with few or no fillers (such as kaolin) obscuring the pigment colors. Typically, most or all of the gum binder will be absorbed by the paper, preventing the binder from changing the visibility of the pigment.<ref name=\"Kraaijpoel2007\"/> The absorption of the gum increases the adhesion of the pigment to the paper, and the pigment particles will penetrate the fibres more easily. In fact, an important function of the gum is to facilitate the \"lifting\" (removal) of color, should the artist want to create a lighter spot in a painted area.<ref name=\"Kraaijpoel2007\"/> Furthermore, the gum prevents  [[flocculation]] of the pigment particles.<ref name=\"Kraaijpoel2007\"/>\n\n==See also==\n{{div col|colwidth=25em}}\n* [[Ink wash painting]]\n* [[Acrylic paint]]\n* [[Acrylic painting techniques]]\n* [[History of painting]]\n* [[Gouache]]\n* [[Oil paint]]\n* [[:Category:Watercolorists]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==References==\n\n===History===\n* Andrew Wilton & Anne Lyles.

Watercolors can also be made opaque by adding [[Chinese white]].\n\nIn East Asia, watercolor painting with inks is referred to as [[brush painting]] or scroll painting. In [[Chinese painting|Chinese]], [[Korean painting|Korean]] and [[Japanese painting]] it has been the dominant medium, often in monochrome black or browns, often using [[inkstick]] or other pigments. India, Ethiopia and other countries have long watercolor painting traditions as well.\n\nAmerican artists in the early 19th century seemed to regard watercolor primarily as a sketching tool in preparation for the \"finished\" work in oil or engraving.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.collectorsguide.com/fa/fa043.shtml|title=THE COLLECTOR\u2019S GUIDE: WHAT IS WATERCOLOR?|website=www.collectorsguide.com}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n\nWatercolor painting is extremely old, dating perhaps to the cave paintings of paleolithic Europe, and has been used for [[illustrated manuscript|manuscript illustration]] since at least [[ancient Egypt|Egyptian times]] but especially in the [[Middle Ages|European Middle Ages]]. However, its ''continuous'' history as an art medium begins with [[the Renaissance]]. The German [[Northern Renaissance]] artist [[Albrecht D\u00fcrer]] (1471\u20131528), who painted several fine botanical, wildlife, and landscape watercolors, is generally considered among the earliest exponents of watercolor. An important school of watercolor painting in Germany was led by [[Hans Bol]] (1534\u20131593) as part of the [[D\u00fcrer Renaissance]].\n\n[[File:Albrecht D\u00fcrer - Hare, 1502 - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|left|[[Albrecht D\u00fcrer]], ''[[Young Hare]]'', 1502, watercolor and [[body color]], [[Albertina, Vienna]]|alt=A painting of a hare with large ears.]]\n \nDespite this early start, watercolors were generally used by Baroque easel painters only for sketches, copies or [[modello|cartoons]] (full-scale design drawings). Notable early practitioners of watercolor painting were [[Anthony van Dyck|Van Dyck]] (during his stay in England), [[Claude Lorrain]], [[Giovanni Benedetto Castiglione]], and many [[Dutch (ethnic group)|Dutch]] and [[Flemish people|Flemish]] artists. However, [[botanical illustration]] and wildlife illustration perhaps form the oldest and most important traditions in watercolor painting. Botanical illustrations became popular during the Renaissance, both as hand-tinted [[woodcut|woodblock]] illustrations in books or broadsheets and as tinted ink drawings on [[vellum]] or paper. Botanical artists have traditionally been some of the most exacting and accomplished watercolor painters, and even today, watercolors\u2014with their unique ability to summarize, clarify, and idealize in full color\u2014are used to illustrate scientific and museum publications. Wildlife illustration reached its peak in the 19th century with artists such as [[John James Audubon]], and today many naturalist [[field guide]]s are still illustrated with watercolor paintings.\n\n===English school===\n\nSeveral factors contributed to the spread of watercolor painting during the 18th century, particularly in England. Among the elite and aristocratic classes, watercolor painting was one of the incidental adornments of a good education; mapmakers, military officers, and engineers used it for its usefulness in depicting properties, terrain, fortifications, field geology, and for illustrating public works or commissioned projects. Watercolor artists were commonly brought with the geological or archaeological expeditions, funded by the [[Society of Dilettanti]] (founded in 1733), to document discoveries in the Mediterranean, Asia, and the New World. These expeditions stimulated the demand for topographical painters, who churned out memento paintings of famous sites (and sights) along the [[Grand Tour|Grand Tour to Italy]] that was undertaken by every fashionable young man of the time.\n\nIn the late 18th century, the English cleric [[William Gilpin (clergyman)|William Gilpin]] wrote a series of hugely popular books describing his [[picturesque]] journeys throughout rural England, and illustrated them with self-made sentimentalized monochrome watercolors of river valleys, ancient castles, and abandoned churches. This example popularized watercolors as a form of personal tourist journal. The confluence of these cultural, engineering, scientific, tourist, and amateur interests culminated in the celebration and promotion of watercolor as a distinctly English \"national art\". [[William Blake]] published several books of hand-tinted engraved poetry, provided illustrations to [[Dante's Inferno|Dante's ''Inferno'']], and he also experimented with large [[monotype]] works in watercolor. Among the many other significant watercolorists of this period were [[Thomas Gainsborough]], [[John Robert Cozens]], [[Francis Towne]], [[Michael Angelo Rooker]], [[William Pars]], [[Thomas Hearne (artist)|Thomas Hearne]], and [[John Warwick Smith]].\n\n[[File:Thomas Girtin 006.JPG|thumb|[[Thomas Girtin]], ''[[Jedburgh Abbey]] from the River'', 1798\u201399, watercolor on paper]]\n \nFrom the late 18th century through the 19th century, the market for printed books and domestic art contributed substantially to the growth of the medium. Watercolors were used as the basic document from which collectible landscape or tourist engravings were developed, and hand-painted watercolor originals or copies of famous paintings contributed to many upper class art portfolios. Satirical broadsides by [[Thomas Rowlandson]], many published by [[Rudolph Ackermann]], were also extremely popular.\n \nThe three English artists credited with establishing watercolor as an independent, mature painting medium are [[Paul Sandby]] (1730\u20131809), often called the \"father of the English watercolor\"; [[Thomas Girtin]] (1775\u20131802), who pioneered its use for large format, romantic or picturesque landscape painting; and [[Joseph Mallord William Turner]] (1775\u20131851), who brought watercolor painting to the highest pitch of power and refinement, and created hundreds of superb historical, topographical, architectural, and mythological watercolor paintings. His method of developing the watercolor painting in stages, starting with large, vague color areas established on wet paper, then refining the image through a sequence of [[wash (visual arts)|washes]] and glazes, permitted him to produce large numbers of paintings with \"workshop efficiency\" and made him a multimillionaire, partly by sales from his personal art gallery, the first of its kind. Among the important and highly talented contemporaries of Turner and Girtin were [[John Varley (painter)|John Varley]], [[John Sell Cotman]], [[Copley Fielding|Anthony Copley Fielding]], [[Samuel Palmer]], [[William Havell]], and [[Samuel Prout]]. The Swiss painter [[Abraham-Louis-Rodolphe Ducros]] was also widely known for his large format, romantic paintings in watercolor.\n\n[[File:Jamaica hut4.jpg|thumb|left|An unfinished watercolor by [[William Berryman]], created between 1808 and 1816, using watercolor, ink, and pencil. The use of partial pigmentation draws attention to the central subject.]]\n\nThe confluence of amateur activity, publishing markets, middle class [[art collecting]], and 19th-century technique led to the formation of English watercolor painting societies: the ''Society of Painters in Water Colours'' (1804, now known as the [[Royal Watercolour Society]]) and the ''New Water Colour Society'' (1832, now known as the [[Royal Institute of Painters in Water Colours]]). (A ''Scottish Society of Painters in Water Colour'' was founded in 1878, now known as the [[Royal Scottish Society of Painters in Watercolour]].) These societies provided annual exhibitions and buyer referrals for many artists. They also engaged in petty status rivalries and aesthetic debates, particularly between advocates of traditional (\"transparent\") watercolor and the early adopters of the denser color possible with [[gouache|body color or gouache]] (\"opaque\" watercolor). The late Georgian and Victorian periods produced the zenith of the British watercolor, among the most impressive 19th-century works on paper,<ref>{{Citation | first = Graham | last = Reynolds | title = Watercolours, A Concise History | place = London | publisher = [[Thames and Hudson]] | year = 1992 | page = 102}}</ref> due to artists Turner, Varley, Cotman, [[David Cox (artist)|David Cox]], [[Peter de Wint]], [[William Henry Hunt (painter)|William Henry Hunt]], [[John Frederick Lewis]], [[Myles Birket Foster]], [[Frederick Walker (painter)|Frederick Walker]], [[Thomas Collier]], [[Arthur Melville]] and many others. In particular, the graceful, lapidary, and atmospheric watercolors (\"genre paintings\") by [[Richard Parkes Bonington]] created an international fad for watercolor painting, especially in England and France in the 1820s.\n \nThe popularity of watercolors stimulated many innovations, including heavier and more [[sizing|sized]] [[wove paper]]s, and brushes (called \"pencils\") manufactured expressly for watercolor. Watercolor tutorials were first published in this period by Varley, Cox, and others, establishing the step-by-step painting instructions that still characterize the genre today; ''The Elements of Drawing'', a watercolor tutorial by English art critic [[John Ruskin]], has been out of print only once since it was first published in 1857. Commercial brands of watercolor were marketed and paints were packaged in metal tubes or as dry cakes that could be \"rubbed out\" (dissolved) in studio porcelain or used in portable metal paint boxes in the field. Breakthroughs in chemistry made many new pigments available, including synthetic [[ultramarine blue]], [[cobalt blue]], [[viridian]], [[cobalt violet]], [[cadmium yellow]], [[aureolin]] ([[potassium cobaltinitrite]]), [[zinc white]], and a wide range of [[carmine]] and [[madder lake]]s. These pigments, in turn, stimulated a greater use of color with all painting media, but in English watercolors, particularly by the [[Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood]].\n\n[[File:The Blue Boat 1892 Winslow Homer.jpg|thumb|right|[[Winslow Homer]], ''The Blue Boat'', 1892]]\n\n====United States====\n[[File:Brooklyn Museum - White Ships - John Singer Sargent.jpg|thumb|right|John Singer Sargent, ''White Ships''. [[Brooklyn Museum]]]]\nWatercolor painting also became popular in the United States during the 19th century; outstanding early practitioners included [[John James Audubon]], as well as early [[Hudson River School]] painters such as [[William H. Bartlett]] and [[George Harvey (painter)|George Harvey]]. By mid-century, the influence of John Ruskin led to increasing interest in watercolors, particularly the use of a detailed \"Ruskinian\" style by such artists as John W. Hill Henry, [[William Trost Richards]], [[Roderick Newman]], and [[Fidelia Bridges]]. The ''American Society of Painters in Watercolor'' (now the [[American Watercolor Society]]) was founded in 1866. Late-19th-century American exponents of the medium included [[Thomas Moran]], [[Thomas Eakins]], [[John LaFarge]], [[John Singer Sargent]], [[Childe Hassam]], and, preeminently, [[Winslow Homer]].\n\n===Europe===\n[[File:Stanis\u0142aw Mas\u0142owski (1853-1926), Autumn landscape in Rybiniszki, 1902.jpeg|thumb|right|[[Stanis\u0142aw Mas\u0142owski]], ''Pejza\u017c jesienny z Rybiniszek'' (Autumn landscape of [[Riebi\u0146i|Rybiniszki]]), watercolor, 1902]]\nWatercolor was less popular in Continental Europe. In the 18th century, [[gouache]] was an important medium for the Italian artists [[Marco Ricci]] and [[Francesco Zuccarelli]], whose landscape paintings were widely collected.<ref>Brown, David Blayney. \"Watercolour.\" ''Grove Art Online. Oxford Art Online''. Oxford University Press. Retrieved April 26, 2014.</ref> Gouache was used by a number of artists in France as well. In the 19th century, the influence of the English school helped popularize \"transparent\" watercolor in France, and it became an important medium for [[Eug\u00e8ne Delacroix]], [[Fran\u00e7ois Marius Granet]], [[Henri-Joseph Harpignies]], and the satirist [[Honor\u00e9 Daumier]]. Other European painters who worked frequently in watercolor were [[Adolph Menzel]] in Germany and [[Stanis\u0142aw Mas\u0142owski]] in Poland.\n\n[[File:Paul C\u00e9zanne 151.jpg|thumb|[[Paul C\u00e9zanne]], self-portrait]]\nUnfortunately, the careless and excessive adoption of brightly colored, petroleum-derived aniline dyes (and pigments compounded from them), which all fade rapidly on exposure to light, and the efforts to properly conserve the twenty thousand [[J. M. W. Turner]] paintings inherited by the British Museum in 1857, led to an examination and negative reevaluation of the permanence of pigments in watercolor.{{Citation needed|date=October 2015}} This caused a sharp decline in their status and market value. Nevertheless, isolated practitioners continued to prefer and develop the medium into the 20th century. Gorgeous landscape and maritime watercolors were done by [[Paul Signac]], and [[Paul C\u00e9zanne]] developed a watercolor painting style consisting entirely of overlapping small glazes of pure color.\n\n===20th and 21st centuries===\nAmong the many 20th-century artists who produced important works in watercolor, [[Wassily Kandinsky]], [[Emil Nolde]], [[Paul Klee]], [[Egon Schiele]], and [[Raoul Dufy]] must be mentioned. In America, the major exponents included [[Charles Burchfield]], [[Edward Hopper]], [[Georgia O'Keeffe]], [[Charles Demuth]], and [[John Marin]] (80% of his total work is watercolor). In this period, American watercolor painting often imitated European Impressionism and Post-Impressionism, but significant individualism flourished in \"regional\" styles of watercolor painting from the 1920s to 1940s. In particular, the \"[[Cleveland School (arts community)|Cleveland School]]\" or \"Ohio School\" of painters centered around the [[Cleveland Museum of Art]], and the [[California Scene Painting|California Scene]] painters were often associated with Hollywood animation studios or the [[Chouinard Art Institute]] (now [[California Institute of the Arts]]). The California painters exploited their state's varied geography, Mediterranean climate, and \"[[Car culture|automobility]]\" to reinvigorate the outdoor or \"plein air\" tradition. The most influential among them were [[Phil Dike]], [[Millard Sheets]], [[Rex Brandt]], [[Dong Kingman]], and [[Milford Zornes]]. The California Water Color Society, founded in 1921 and later renamed the National Watercolor Society, sponsored important exhibitions of their work. The largest watercolor in the world at the moment is ''Building 6 Portrait: Interior.''<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.smithsonianmag.com/travel/story-behind-worlds-largest-known-watercolor-painting-180963798/|title=The Story Behind the World\u2019s Largest Watercolor Painting|last=Nalewicki|first=Jennifer|work=Smithsonian|access-date=2018-07-01|language=en}}</ref> Produced by American artist Barbara Ernst Prey on commission for MASS MoCA,<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://creators.vice.com/en_us/article/8x4w54/mass-moca-worlds-largest-watercolor|title=The World's Largest Watercolor Goes on Display at MASS MoCA|date=2017-05-30|work=Creators|access-date=2018-07-01|language=en-us}}</ref> the work can be seen at MASS MoCA's Robert W.

In Spain, [[Cefer\u00ed Oliv\u00e9]] created an innovative style followed by his students, such as [[Rafael Alonso L\u00f3pez-Montero]] and [[Francesc Torn\u00e9 Gavald\u00e0]]. In [[Mexico]], the major exponents are [[Ignacio Barrios]], [[Edgardo Coghlan]], [[\u00c1ngel Mauro]], [[Vicente Mendiola]], and [[Pastor Vel\u00e1zquez]]. In the [[Canary Islands]], where this pictorial technique has many followers, there are stand-out artists such as Francisco Bonn\u00edn Guer\u00edn, [[Jos\u00e9 Comas Quesada]], and Alberto Manrique.\n\n==Watercolor paint==\n[[File:Watercolours.jpg|thumb|A set of watercolors]]\n\nWatercolor paint consists of four principal ingredients: a [[pigment]]; [[gum arabic]] as a binder to hold the pigment in suspension; additives like [[glycerin]], [[ox gall]], [[honey]], and preservatives to alter the viscosity, hiding, durability or color of the pigment and vehicle mixture; and evaporating water, as a solvent used to thin or dilute the paint for application.\n\nThe more general term ''[[watermedia]]'' refers to any painting medium that uses water as a solvent and that can be applied with a [[brush]], [[pen]], or sprayer. This includes most [[ink]]s, [[watercolor]]s, [[tempera]]s, [[casein paint|casein]]s, [[gouache]]s, and modern [[acrylic paint]]s.\n\nThe term \"watercolor\" refers to paints that use water-soluble, complex carbohydrates as a binder. Originally (in the 16th to 18th centuries), watercolor binders were sugars and/or hide glues, but since the 19th century, the preferred binder is natural [[gum arabic]], with [[glycerin]] and/or [[honey]] as additives to improve plasticity and solubility of the binder, and with other chemicals added to improve product shelf life.\n\nThe term \"[[bodycolor]]\" refers to paint that is opaque rather than transparent. It usually refers to opaque watercolor, known as [[gouache]].<ref>The Oxford Dictionary of Art and Artists, Ian Chilvers, Oxford University Press USA, 2009</ref> Modern acrylic paints use an [[acrylic resin]] dispersion as a binder.\n\n===Commercial watercolors===\nWatercolor painters before the turn of the 18th century had to make paints themselves using pigments purchased from an [[apothecary]] or specialized \"colorman\", and mixing them with gum arabic or some other binder. The earliest commercial paints were small, resinous blocks that had to be wetted and laboriously \"rubbed out\" in water to obtain a usable color intensity. [[William Reeves (colourman)|William Reeves]] started his business as a colorman around 1766. In 1781, he and his brother, Thomas Reeves, were awarded the Silver Palette of the [[Society of Arts]], for the invention of the moist watercolor ''paint-cake'', a time-saving convenience, introduced in the \"golden age\" of English watercolor painting. The \"cake\" was immediately soluble when touched by a wet brush.\n[[File:Watercolors by William Reeves, London, inventor of watercolors in cakes, undated - Joseph Allen Skinner Museum - DSC07847.JPG|left|thumb|upright|A Reeves box]]\nModern commercial watercolor paints are available in two forms: tubes or pans. The majority of paints sold today are in collapsible small metal tubes in standard sizes and formulated to a consistency similar to toothpaste by being already mixed with a certain water component. For use, this paste has to be further diluted with water. Pan paints (actually small dried cakes or bars of paint in an open plastic container) are usually sold in two sizes, full pans and half pans.\n\nOwing to modern [[Industrial technology|industrial]] [[organic chemistry]], the variety, [[colorfulness|saturation]], and permanence of artists' colors available today has been vastly improved. Correct and non-toxic [[primary colors]] are now present through the introduction of [[hansa yellow]], [[phthalo blue]] and [[quinacridone]] (PV 122). From such a set of three colors, in principle all others can be mixed, as in a classical technique no white is used. The modern development of pigments was not driven by artistic demand. The [[art materials]] industry is too small to exert any market leverage on global dye or pigment manufacture. With rare exceptions such as aureolin, all modern watercolor paints utilize pigments that have a wider industrial use. Paint manufacturers buy, by industrial standards very small, supplies of these pigments, [[Mill (grinding)|mill]] them with the vehicle, solvent, and additives, and package them. The milling process with inorganic pigments, in more expensive brands, reduces the particle size to improve the color flow when the paint is applied with water.\n\n===Transparency===\nIn the partisan debates of the 19th-century English art world, gouache was emphatically contrasted to traditional watercolors and denigrated for its high hiding power or lack of \"transparency\"; \"transparent\" watercolors were exalted. The aversion to opaque paint had its origin in the fact that well into the 19th century [[lead white]] was used to increase the covering quality. That pigment tended to soon discolor into black under the influence of sulphurous air pollution, totally ruining the artwork.<ref>D. Kraaijpoel & C. Herenius. (2007) ''Het kunstschilderboek \u2014 handboek voor materialen en technieken'', Cantecleer, p. 187</ref> The traditional claim that \"transparent\" watercolors gain \"luminosity\" because they function like a pane of stained glass laid on paper\u2014the color intensified because the light passes through the pigment, reflects from the paper, and passes a second time through the pigment on its way to the viewer\u2014is false. Watercolor paints typically do not form a cohesive paint layer, as do acrylic or [[oil paint|oil]] paints, but simply scatter pigment particles randomly across the [[paper]] surface; the transparency is caused by the paper being visible between the particles.<ref name=\"Kraaijpoel2007\">D. Kraaijpoel & C. Herenius. (2007) ''Het kunstschilderboek \u2014 handboek voor materialen en technieken'', Cantecleer, p. 183</ref> Watercolors may appear more vivid than acrylics or oils because the pigments are laid down in a purer form, with few or no fillers (such as kaolin) obscuring the pigment colors. Typically, most or all of the gum binder will be absorbed by the paper, preventing the binder from changing the visibility of the pigment.<ref name=\"Kraaijpoel2007\"/> The absorption of the gum increases the adhesion of the pigment to the paper, and the pigment particles will penetrate the fibres more easily. In fact, an important function of the gum is to facilitate the \"lifting\" (removal) of color, should the artist want to create a lighter spot in a painted area.<ref name=\"Kraaijpoel2007\"/> Furthermore, the gum prevents  [[flocculation]] of the pigment particles.<ref name=\"Kraaijpoel2007\"/>\n\n==See also==\n{{div col|colwidth=25em}}\n* [[Ink wash painting]]\n* [[Acrylic paint]]\n* [[Acrylic painting techniques]]\n* [[History of painting]]\n* [[Gouache]]\n* [[Oil paint]]\n* [[:Category:Watercolorists]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==References==\n\n===History===\n* Andrew Wilton & Anne Lyles.

Factors included salaries,{{sfn|Renquist|1974|pp=51\u201352}} scathing inspectors,{{sfn|Renquist|1974|pp=24 & 27}} isolation, community factions,{{sfn|Renquist|1974|p=28}} no running water, no electricity, inadequate heat,{{sfn|Renquist|1974|p=41}} teaching multiple grades,{{sfn|Renquist|1974|p=49}} and sometimes an expectation to organize the various children's social activities for the community at large.{{sfn|Renquist|1974|pp=49 & 51}} Rural schools were dependant upon a smaller and volatile local tax base for funding. When an economic downturn, fire, or depleted accessible timber, closed a sawmill (the primary employer in most rural communities), workers relocated, student numbers dropped, and the tax base collapsed.{{sfn|Renquist|1974|pp=29 & 35}}\n\nRural school buildings were usually rudimentary, and many in a poor state of repair. Equipment and supplies were limited.{{sfn|Renquist|1974|pp=38, 41 & 42}}  Consequently, rural students, receiving the barest elementary programs,{{sfn|Renquist|1974|p=33}} lacked educational opportunities, and few progressed to a secondary school offered only by a main centre.{{sfn|Renquist|1974|p=53}}\n\nThe 1946 implementation{{sfn|Renquist|1974|p=95}} of the 1945 Cameron Report into BC school financing and administration{{sfn|Renquist|1974|pp=65\u201366, 76}} created centralized larger districts. Benefits to rural schools were a broader tax base,{{sfn|Renquist|1974|p=84}} to Prince George schools an augmentation of existing infrastructure,{{sfn|Renquist|1974|p=86}} and to all schools an increase in provincial funding from 30 to 50 percent.{{sfn|Renquist|1974|p=98}} The earlier municipal districts provided no guidance as to setting boundaries, because many were quite small, and 90 percent of the province was unorganized.{{sfn|Renquist|1974|p=81}} The new Prince George school district boundaries were equidistant between Quesnel southward, Vanderhoof westward, and at Penny southeastward.{{sfn|Renquist|1974|p=82}} On the disbanding of local boards, the former Prince George one, comprising members of civic and economic stature, became the interim board.{{sfn|Renquist|1974|p=95}} The elected 1948 board comprised four city and three rural representatives,{{sfn|Renquist|1974|p=96}} reaffirming some degree of local control.{{sfn|Renquist|1974|p=98}}\n\nThe new board did not operate with complete autonomy, but had to avail itself of the experience, training, and knowledge of local inspectors of schools,{{sfn|Renquist|1974|pp=96\u201397}} who represented the province. The latter, who had been regarded as faultfinders by local trustees, became mentors aligned with the centralized trustees.{{sfn|Renquist|1974|p=101}} The board became a buffer between local residents and the province,{{sfn|Renquist|1974|p=100}} and the inspectors were freed from petty management issues.{{sfn|Renquist|1974|p=102}}\n\nBurgeoning student numbers throughout the 1950s saw massive increases in teacher recruitment and classroom capacity.{{sfn|Renquist|1974|p=104}} Many new schools served residential development along the new highways north and west.{{sfn|Renquist|1974|p=105}} However by the mid 1950s, building remote rural schools rarely occurred because of maintenance challenges, and from the late 1950s, numerous schools closed as mills closed.{{sfn|Renquist|1974|p=107}}\n\nIn 1970, SD 58 Mc Bride merged into SD 57, and its board dissolved. The new enlarged school district matches the boundaries of the [[Regional District of Fraser-Fort George]].<ref>Prince George Citizen, 18 Jun 1970</ref>\n\n===Board of trustees and superintendents===\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Factors included salaries,{{sfn|Renquist|1974|pp=51\u201352}} scathing inspectors,{{sfn|Renquist|1974|pp=24 & 27}} isolation, community factions,{{sfn|Renquist|1974|p=28}} no running water, no electricity, inadequate heat,{{sfn|Renquist|1974|p=41}} teaching multiple grades,{{sfn|Renquist|1974|p=49}} and sometimes an expectation to organize the various children's social activities for the community at large.{{sfn|Renquist|1974|pp=49 & 51}} Rural schools were dependant upon a smaller and volatile local tax base for funding. When an economic downturn, fire, or depleted accessible timber, closed a sawmill (the primary employer in most rural communities), workers relocated, student numbers dropped, and the tax base collapsed.{{sfn|Renquist|1974|pp=29 & 35}}  \n\nRural school buildings were usually rudimentary, and many in a poor state of repair. Equipment and supplies were limited.{{sfn|Renquist|1974|pp=38, 41 & 42}}  Consequently, rural students, receiving the barest elementary programs,{{sfn|Renquist|1974|p=33}} lacked educational opportunities, and few progressed to a secondary school offered only by a main centre.{{sfn|Renquist|1974|p=53}}\n\nThe 1946 implementation{{sfn|Renquist|1974|p=95}} of the 1945 Cameron Report into BC school financing and administration{{sfn|Renquist|1974|pp=65\u201366, 76}} created centralized larger districts. Benefits to rural schools were a broader tax base,{{sfn|Renquist|1974|p=84}} to Prince George schools an augmentation of existing infrastructure,{{sfn|Renquist|1974|p=86}} and to all schools an increase in provincial funding from 30 to 50 percent.{{sfn|Renquist|1974|p=98}} The earlier municipal districts provided no guidance as to setting boundaries, because many were quite small, and 90 percent of the province was unorganized.{{sfn|Renquist|1974|p=81}} The new Prince George school district boundaries were equidistant between Quesnel southward, Vanderhoof westward, and at Penny southeastward.{{sfn|Renquist|1974|p=82}} On the disbanding of local boards, the former Prince George one, comprising members of civic and economic stature, became the interim board.{{sfn|Renquist|1974|p=95}} The elected 1948 board comprised four city and three rural representatives,{{sfn|Renquist|1974|p=96}} reaffirming some degree of local control.{{sfn|Renquist|1974|p=98}}\n\nThe new board did not operate with complete autonomy, but had to avail itself of the experience, training, and knowledge of local inspectors of schools,{{sfn|Renquist|1974|pp=96\u201397}} who represented the province. The latter, who had been regarded as faultfinders by local trustees, became mentors aligned with the centralized trustees.{{sfn|Renquist|1974|p=101}} The board became a buffer between local residents and the province,{{sfn|Renquist|1974|p=100}} and the inspectors were freed from petty management issues.{{sfn|Renquist|1974|p=102}} \n\nBurgeoning student numbers throughout the 1950s saw massive increases in teacher recruitment and classroom capacity.{{sfn|Renquist|1974|p=104}} Many new schools served residential development along the new highways north and west.{{sfn|Renquist|1974|p=105}} However by the mid 1950s, building remote rural schools rarely occurred because of maintenance challenges, and from the late 1950s, numerous schools closed as mills closed.{{sfn|Renquist|1974|p=107}}\n\nIn 1970, SD 58 Mc Bride merged into SD 57, and its board dissolved. The new enlarged school district matches the boundaries of the [[Regional District of Fraser-Fort George]].<ref>Prince George Citizen, 18 Jun 1970</ref>\n\n===Board of trustees and superintendents===\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!
