The [[Bark (botany)|bark]] helps to distinguish it from other species. Mature to over-mature individuals have yellow to orange-red bark in broad to very broad plates with black crevices. Younger trees have blackish-brown bark, referred to as \"blackjacks\" by early loggers. Ponderosa pine's five [[subspecies]], as classified by some botanists, can be identified by their characteristically bright-green needles (contrasting with blue-green needles that distinguish [[Jeffrey pine]]). The Pacific subspecies has the longest\u2014{{cvt |19.8|cm|in|order=flip}}\u2014and most flexible needles in plume-like [[Fascicle (botany)|fascicles]] of three. The Columbia ponderosa pine has long\u2014{{cvt |12.0|\u2013|20.5|cm|in|order=flip}}\u2014and relatively flexible needles in fascicles of three. The Rocky Mountains subspecies has shorter\u2014{{cvt|9.2|\u2013|14.4|cm|in|order=flip}}\u2014and stout needles growing in scopulate (bushy, tuft-like) fascicles of two or three. The southwestern subspecies has {{cvt |11.2|\u2013|19.8|cm|in|order=flip}}, stout needles in fascicles of three (averaging {{cvt|2.7|\u2013|3.5|in}}).

Kuchler|Kuchler]] plant association, the [[ponderosa shrub forest]]. Like most western pines, the ponderosa generally is associated with mountainous topography. However, it is found on banks of the [[Niobrara River]] in Nebraska. Scattered stands occur in the [[Willamette Valley]] of Oregon and in the [[Okanagan Valley]] and [[Puget Sound]] areas of Washington. Stands occur throughout low level valleys in British Columbia reaching as far north as the Thompson, Fraser and Columbia watersheds. In its Northern limits, it only grows below 1,300m (4,200ft) elevation, but is most common below 800m (2,600ft).

Younger trees have blackish-brown bark, referred to as \"blackjacks\" by early loggers.

The Pacific subspecies has the longest\u2014{{cvt |19.8|cm|in|order=flip}}\u2014and most flexible needles in plume-like [[Fascicle (botany)|fascicles]] of three.

Kuchler|Kuchler]] plant association, the [[ponderosa shrub forest]]. Like most western pines, the ponderosa generally is associated with mountainous topography. However, it is found on banks of the [[Niobrara River]] in Nebraska. Scattered stands occur in the [[Willamette Valley]] of Oregon and in the [[Okanagan Valley]] and [[Puget Sound]] areas of Washington.

The Royalist forces withdrew, having sustained heavy casualties and had several cannons disabled as a result of sallies made by the defenders.\n\n==Prelude==\nFollowing the Royalist defeat at the [[Battle of Edgehill]] in October 1642, King Charles I's control of the south was limited to [[Cornwall]], [[Wales]] and the [[Welsh Marches|Marches]], and a pocket of the [[Thames Valley]] around [[Oxford]], where he based his wartime capital.<ref>Day 2007 p. 29</ref> The ruling [[Puritans|Puritan]] elite of [[Gloucester]] ensured the city of some 5,000 inhabitants would be from the outset a staunchly Parliamentarian stronghold in the struggle against an anti-Puritan King and his [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] Queen.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 59\u201360</ref> Possession of Gloucester, along with [[Bristol]] to the south, threatened both Oxford and access to the Royalist recruiting grounds of Wales.<ref>Day 2007 p. 21</ref>\n\nAn unsuccessful attempt to rally Royalist support in [[Cirencester]] in August 1642 prompted Parliamentarians in [[Gloucestershire]] to muster the [[Militia (English)|militia]], and in November the first regular troops were garrisoned in Gloucester.<ref>Day 2007 p. 60</ref> In February 1643 the Royalist commander [[Prince Rupert of the Rhine|Prince Rupert]] easily defeated a militia garrison at Cirencester, prompting the Parliamentarians to recall their outposts at [[Berkeley, Gloucestershire|Berkeley]], [[Sudeley Castle|Sudeley]] and [[Tewkesbury]]. The next day Rupert appeared before Gloucester, but lacked the strength to enforce his demand for the city's surrender. Later that month an army of 2,000 Welshman led by [[Henry Somerset, 1st Duke of Beaufort|Lord Herbert of Raglan]] arrived on the west bank of the Severn opposite the city, but lacked the strength for an assault across the river. Its presence caused great consternation in Gloucester until a Parliamentarian army commanded by Sir [[William Waller]] defeated it on 24 March.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 60\u201362</ref>\n\nThe defeat of Waller in the [[Battle of Roundway Down]] on 13 July by the Royalist Western Army left both Bristol and Gloucester vulnerable, and on 18 July Rupert led another Royalist army out of Oxford to take control of the Severn valley. On 26 July Rupert's Oxford Army, supported by the Western Army, seized Bristol. Royalist casualties were high, and despite Rupert's instructions to the contrary, the victorious troops plundered the city.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 21\u201325</ref> Rupert was appointed governor of Bristol, but infighting within the Royalist leadership and concerns that an attack on Gloucester would result in the same high casualties prompted [[Charles I of England|King Charles I]] to travel to Bristol for a council of war.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 26\u201328</ref> He arrived on 2 August, and over the next five days consulted with his advisers on the best course of action. The strategic situation since Edgehill had improved significantly for the Royalists, with victories in the north of England, the arrival of reinforcements and materiel in June, and an opposition that had fallen into disarray.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 29\u201331</ref> Rupert's plan to consolidate the Royalist grip on the west by seizing Gloucester faced opposition from those in the King's camp, led by his wife Queen [[Henrietta Maria of France|Henrietta Maria]], who believed a march on London could end the war.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 51\u201353</ref>\n\nThe capture of Gloucester would give Charles some advantages. It would allow the Royalist garrisons farther up the Severn at [[Worcester]] and [[Shrewsbury]] to be supplied from Bristol, with consequent benefit to the economy of that city. Gloucestershire \u2013 populous, wealthy and Parliamentarian \u2013 could be punitively taxed, and Welsh manpower and money could be freely deployed against the King's enemies in the rest of the country. Although it was likely that Rupert would have been able to storm a city that was less well defended than Bristol, Charles was not willing to risk the casualties an assault would incur.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 54\u201355</ref> On 6 August the Parliamentarian governor of Gloucester, Lieutenant-Colonel [[Edward Massey]], refused to surrender the city, but in a secret communication he let it be known that he would do so if the King, rather than Rupert, led the army on Gloucester. Charles decided the next day that this was the best chance of securing Gloucester quickly and without bloodshed. This compromise plan pleased neither the Queen's faction, who saw it as an unnecessary diversion from the more decisive objective of London, nor Rupert, who remained in Bristol in the belief that the Royalist army was not strong enough to allow Massey to honourably surrender without a fight.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 55\u201357</ref>\n\n==Gloucester defences==\n[[File:SoG 1.jpg|thumb|upright=2|City defences during the siege in 1643]]\nGloucester's strength lay in its location. To the west, the River Severn formed a natural defence against an assaulting army. To the north and north-east the marshy ground was unsuitable for siege operations, and the River Twyver and a tributary stream added to the obstacles. This left the higher and drier ground to the east and south as the only feasible directions for an attack. In the preceding centuries the city had grown beyond its medieval defences, of which only the ruined [[Gloucester Castle|castle]] by the river and a stretch of wall that linked the south, east and original north fates, the last known as the inner north gate and now well within the city, still survived. From the south gate to the east gate the wall was high but not thick enough to withstand 17th-century artillery or mining operations.<ref name=Day65\u201366>Day 2007 pp. 65\u201366</ref>\n\nThe fall of Bristol prompted the hurried reinforcement of the existing defences. New earthworks and a narrow water-filled ditch completed the line of fortifications from the south gate to the Severn. Another earthwork was extended north from Whitefriars Barn on the north-east corner of the medieval wall to the outer north gate. From there the River Twyver formed a moat as the earthwork followed it north-west to Alvin Gate then on to the river's junction with the Old Severn.<ref name=Day65\u201366 /> This easternmost channel of the River Severn had dried up by the 19th century, but at the time of the civil war it was still a navigable river.<ref>Herbert 1988 para. 2</ref><ref>Rhodes 2006 p. 14</ref> The earthwork then followed the Old Severn south-west to a point a short distance north of Westgate Street, from where it was extended the other side of the Old Severn to the River Severn just above the west gate.<ref name=Day66>Day 2007 p. 66</ref> Inside the city, an earthwork was extended west from the end of the medieval wall at the inner north gate via [[Gloucester Cathedral]] to [[St Oswald's Priory, Gloucester|St Oswald's Priory]], where it met the new outer earthwork.<ref name=Day66 /> The outer north gate and Alvin Gate were fortified with earthwork [[bastion]]s,<ref name=Day66 /> a drawbridge was installed at Westgate Bridge and the Old Severn was dammed at Dockham, causing the ground to north-west of the city to flood.<ref>Rhodes 2006 pp. 17, 29\u201330</ref>\n\nThe garrison numbered no more than 1,500 troops. The bulk of these comprised two half-strength regiments each of some 600 men: the [[Henry Grey, 1st Earl of Stamford|Earl of Stamford]]'s Regiment of Foot, recruited from London and Leicestershire, and a locally recruited regiment known as the Town Regiment. The remainder comprised a company of [[Trained bands|trained band]], 100 [[dragoon]]s and a [[troop]] of cavalry. The city's dozen or so artillery pieces ranged in size from light cannon to two nine-pounder [[demi-culverin]]s. Stamford's regiment was experienced and well led, though of uncertain discipline. The Town Regiment lacked experience but was motivated by its ties to the city it was defending, although there is evidence that some of its men would refuse to oppose the King. The city could support itself with basic necessities, but it lacked sufficient gunpowder to withstand an assault or prolonged siege.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 63\u201365</ref>\n\nMassey was an autocratic military commander, but his authority in the city was shared with the civilian administration. A committee had been established in December 1642 to manage the Parliamentarian war effort in the county, but [[Thomas Pury]], the [[member of parliament]] for Gloucester, was the only committee member in the city. Civic authority was held by a forty-member council, though in practice an inner core of some fifteen [[Alderman|aldermen]], including the mayor, wielded power. As many of these were, like Pury, officers in the city's garrison, political and military command was largely integrated.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 66\u201367</ref> In the days immediately following the fall of Bristol, morale in the city, both military and civilian, was low.<ref>Day 2007 p. 68</ref> It's possible that this was what prompted Massey consider surrendering the city, though his message suggesting he would may have been a subterfuge designed to buy some time.<ref>Day 2007 p. 73</ref> There is strong evidence that the conduct and actions of the city elite, including Massey and particularly Pury, did much to stiffen the city's resolve. Officers and councillors with Royalist sympathies were given the opportunity to leave, and those who remained were required to restate an oath of allegiance to Parliament. The discipline of the troops was improved by paying them, and civilians were kept busy reinforcing the city's defences.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 69\u201370</ref>\n\n==Siege==\nAs Charles marched north from Bristol, reinforcements were converging on Gloucester from Oxford, Worcester and Herefordshire.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 86\u201387</ref> By the afternoon of 10 August the Royalist army, comprising some 6,000 infantry and 2,500 mounted troops, began assembling around the city.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 90\u201391</ref> Charles set up his headquarters at [[Matson, Gloucester|Matson]] House.<ref>Day 2007 p. 97</ref> His demand for Gloucester's surrender was unanimously and somewhat insolently rejected, and the Parliamentarians set fire to the suburbs outside the city defences to clear lines of fire and deprive the Royalists of cover.<ref>Day 2007 pp. , 91\u201393,96</ref> Charles had decided to march on Gloucester in the belief that the city would be quickly surrendered. Now that gambit had failed, he decided to besiege it. His pride had been wounded by the manner of the Parliamentarian rejection. His commanders, assessing the state of the city's defences, supplies and morale, persuaded him the city could be taken within ten days without an assault. Intelligence indicated the even if the Parliamentarians were able to send a relieving force, it could be easily defeated before it could reach the city. Most decisively, the [[William Cavendish, 1st Duke of Newcastle|Earl of Newcastle]], whose support was necessary in any campaign against London, declared himself unable to march south while Hull remained in Parliamentarian hands, leaving Charles too weak to contemplate such a move.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 93\u201395</ref>\n\n===First ten days===\n\n[[File:SoG 2.jpg|thumb|upright=2|Royalist dispositions during the siege]]\nThe first shots were fired in the afternoon as Sir [[Jacob Astley, 1st Baron Astley of Reading|Jacob Astley]] established his forces near Issold's House on the eastern side of the city. [[Patrick Ruthven, 1st Earl of Forth|Lord Forth]], who had been given overall command of the siege, set up a fortified leaguer to the rear of the ruined [[Llanthony Secunda Priory]] and established his forces to the south of the city.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 95\u201396, 99, 100\u2013101</ref> By dawn on 11 August, a line of trenches had been dug some {{convert|130|yd|m}} from the walls, placing the two sides within musket range of each other, stretching from [[Brunswick Square, Gloucester|Gaudy Green]] on the south side to Issold's House on the east.<ref>Day 2007 p. 99</ref> Massey responded with spoiling tactics in an attempt to hinder Royalist siege operations and delay the assault he was expecting. At midnight a small raiding party succeeded in disrupting Royalist entrenching operations on Gaudy Green, and a larger raid on the green the next morning, 12 August, resulted in the capture of Royalist men, tools and weapons.<ref>Day 2007 p. 100</ref> By this time, the reinforcements from Herefordshire and Worcester under the command of Sir William Vavasour arrived on the west bank of the Severn and began crossing the river to take up positions at Kingsholm, to the north of the city. This force increased the size of the besieging army by another 2,400 infantry and over 300 cavalry. They too were the target of a Parliamentarian raid which inflicted up to fifteen casualties on the Royalists.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 10, 100</ref>\n\nLater on 12 August, Forth completed an earthwork square on Gaudy Green, in which he placed two 24-pounders, the largest of the Royalist's eight cannon, along with a 12-pounder to target the south wall. Another artillery emplacement was positioned to target the east wall nearby.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 10, 99\u2013102</ref> With the artillery in place, the Royalists began bombarding the walls, with the main effort beginning at 11:00 on 13 August. The cannon were too light to have any significant impact, and of the two mortars the Royalists possessed, one, reputed to be the largest in the country, exploded on its first use. When it became evident the Royalists were focusing their efforts on the south-east corner of the city defences, Massey quickly buttressed the medieval walls with up to {{convert|5|ft|m}} of earth, which ensured that the defences held. Meanwhile, the majority of Vavasour's troops completed their crossing of the Severn, leaving behind a small contingent to blockade the west bank.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 100\u2013102</ref>\n\nReacting to rumours that Vavasour had received a reinforcement of artillery, the Parliamentarians mounted another raid to the north of the city on 14 August. They captured two prisoners but failed in their primary objective of locating and spiking any guns.<ref>Day 2007 p. 102</ref> The Royalist bombardment continued through 14 August, but a breach blown in the wall by the larger guns on Gaudy Green was quickly plugged by the defenders with woolsacks and [[gabion]]s. Royalist engineers mining towards the walls from trenches at the green succeeded in draining the ditch below the walls, but this was not followed up with an assault. By the end of the day the Royalist guns had fallen silent; the evidence suggests they had run out of ammunition.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 102\u2013103</ref>\n\nThe following day Vavasour received a reinforcement of 500 [[Glamorgan]] militia and 450 musketeers from Bristol, while the Parliamentarians bolstered the earthwork defences around the south and north gates. On 16 August Rupert accompanied Charles to Oxford, and neither were at Gloucester to witness the most ambitious Parliamentarian raid yet. Just before sunset, 150 musketeers of Stamford's regiment sallied out of the north gate to attack the Royalist trenches east of the city. The Parliamentarians claimed 100 Royalist killed for the cost of 2 injured, while Royalist sources report 24 Parliamentarians killed and more wounded, for the loss of 4 Royalists killed.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 103\u2013105</ref>\n\nStruggling with a shortage of gunpowder and with the guns quiet, the Royalists concentrated on mining operations to breach the city walls. Miners recruited from the [[Forest of Dean]] were set to work under a protective gallery to fill the {{convert|12|ft|m|adj=on}} deep by {{convert|30|ft|m|adj=on}} wide moat which, when completed, would allow them to undermine the walls. It was slow work, estimated to need a week to complete. The faster alternative was to forgo the protection and fill the moat with [[fascine]]s. An attempt to do this was beaten back by musket fire from the walls, and resulted in the desertion of the miners.<ref>Day 2007 103, 106\u2013107</ref>\n\nBy 18 August Vavasour had deployed three cannon in front of his main camp at Kingsholm and another opposite Alvin Gate. These were the targets of a Parliamentarian raid that morning that was even larger than previous efforts; a diversionary attack by 50 men and a main force of 400. All four of Vavasour's cannon were disabled, the Parliamentarians claiming over 100 Royalist casualties for the loss of 6, the Royalists admitting 28 casualties and claiming to have killed 27 Parliamentarians. Another Parliamentarian raid the same day involved their only recorded use of cavalry during the siege, when 150 musketeers and 40 cavalry mounted an ineffectual attack on Royalist positions to the east of the city. Charles, meanwhile, was on his way back to Gloucester with another 1,000 reinforcements.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 106\u2013107</ref>\n\nBy the morning of 19 August, two 6-pounder cannon had been installed in a third emplacement opposite the east gate, bringing all the original artillery online. At 10:00, the bombardment was resumed in a last effort to subdue the city by the original ten-day deadline. Constrained by the limited supplies of ammunition and gunpowder, the bombardment had little material effect, though it prompted Massey to hastily erect a breastwork in the open ground of Friar's Orchard, at the south east corner of the city where the Royalist artillery was being concentrated. A Royalist attempt to cross the moat after dark was beaten back by musket fire. The objective of forcing the surrender of Gloucester by siege in ten days had failed, partly due to the city's resolve and Massey's spoiling attacks, but mainly due to the inadequacy of the Royalist artillery.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 107\u2013109</ref>\n\n===Shift of focus to mining===\n\nThe Parliamentarians mounted another raid at dawn on 21 August. It was a two-pronged attack designed to disable the Royalist artillery south and east of the walls. One detachment travelled by boat down the Severn, landed between Forth's camp and a redoubt opposite the castle and successfuly stormed the redoubt. The second detachment of 200 musketeers sallied from the north gate. Intending first to attack the battery opposite the east gate, this force became lost and blundered into Royalist infantry camps. When Massey saw that the raid was not going to plan, he sounded the recall. The Parliamentarians suffered eight casualties, the Royalists more than twenty. Such raids were proving risky and wasteful of the garrison's limited ammunition, and this was the last large-scale operation mounted by the Parliamentarians.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 112\u2013113</ref>\n\nAs the Royalists set about replenishing their stocks of ammunition, they intensified their mining efforts. It was anticipated that the original effort to bridge the moat would allow the besiegers to reach the east wall on 24 August. A second effort to bridge the moat to the south was begun, as was a more complicated project to tunnel towards the east gate. Royalist agents attempted to persuade the garrison to surrender, and Royalist cavalry staged a mock battle in an unsuccessful attempt to lure the garrison out of the city in the belief that a relief force had arrived.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 114\u2013115</ref> A desultory bombardment was maintained, particularly by the mortars, until 25 August, when it was intensified. An attempt that day by Massey to disrupt it with a sally from the north gate was beaten back by cavalry, but as before, a shortage of ammunition \u2013 at one stage the Royalists resorted to firing stones \u2013 blunted the impact, and little damage was done to the city.<ref>Day 2007 p. 116</ref>\n\nFollowing news that the [[Robert Devereux, 3rd Earl of Essex|Earl of Essex]] was raising a Parliamentarian army in London, Charles and Rupert travelled to Oxford on 26 August, where they held a two-day council of war. With no intelligence of Essex's plans, the Royalists bolstered the defences of Oxford with troops earmarked for the siege of Gloucester while the Royalist garrison at Bristol was urged to send all the forces it could spare to Gloucester. Believing that Essex could muster no more than 6,000 troops, the decision was made to continue the siege, though contingency plans for the blockade of Gloucester were drawn up in case it had to be lifted. [[Henry Wilmot, 1st Earl of Rochester|Lord Wilmot]] was instructed to muster 2,000 cavalry around [[Banbury]]. Their task would be to delay the Parliamentarians in the [[Cotswolds]] until Rupert could come up with the rest of the Royalist cavalry in support, should Essex march to the relief of Gloucester.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 117\u2013118</ref>\n\nEssex began his march from [[Colnbrook]], west of London, on 26 August.<ref>Day 2007 p. 127</ref> His plan was to relieve Gloucester without provoking a major battle in which, with the Royalist superiority in cavalry, he would be at a disdvantage. His route was dictated by the desire to minimise the amount of open country favourable to cavalry operations he would have to pass through, and took him north of Oxford via Aylesbury and Bicester and then across the Cotswolds.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 124\u2013126</ref> At the beginning of September Essex was due north of Oxford with an army of some 10,500 infantry, no more than 4,500 mounted troops and an artillery train that is estimated at no more than 50 guns.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 130\u2013131, 133</ref>\n\nMining was now the principal tactic by which the Royalists hoped to bring the siege to a successful conclusion. Priority was given to tunnelling at the east gate, which caused progress on efforts to fill the moat below the south and east walls to slow, possibly as a result of a lack of miners and engineers. Parliamentarian countermining at the east gate on 28 August was quickly abandoned because of springs that caused flooding, which accounts for the slow pace of the Royalist efforts there.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 136\u2013138</ref> Massey continued to harass the besiegers with sniping and artillery fire, and he resumed countermining operations at the east gate after a reconnaissance party had reported Royalists miners were still working on their mine. The progress of the Royalist mines closer towards the walls, quickened by the arrival of Welsh miners on 29 August, led Massey to believe an assault was imminent. On 1 September he fortified Friars Orchard with an earthwork wall and [[Sconce (fortification)|sconce]], a fort in which he placed four pieces of artillery that could be brought to bear on any Royalists who broke through the south-east corner or the east gate.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 138\u2013140</ref>\n\nOn 3 September the Parliamentarians placed a [[Saker (cannon)|saker]] in a gun port they had been secretly building in east wall above the gallery protecting the Royalist miners. The medium-sized cannon was employed most of the day against the gallery, to little effect, until the Royalists targeted it with a cannon of their own, at which point it was withdrawn. The Royalists anticipated their mine would reach the east gate the next day, while they believed Essex could be delayed in the Cotswolds for four days. The Bristol garrison was being stripped for reinforcements and orders had been sent to Oxford for ten field guns and the equipment necessary to make the guns already at Gloucester mobile, should it become necessary to redeploy them from siegework to use in open battle.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 140\u2013141</ref>\n\n===Approach of the relief army===\n\nBy the end of 3 September Essex's lead element, the London brigade, was at [[Oddington, Gloucestershire|Oddington]], {{convert|2|mi|km}} east of [[Stow-on-the-Wold]]. The Parliamentarian army was largely untroubled by Wilmot's Royalist cavalry, and because of the differing rates of march it was strung out as far back as [[Chipping Norton]], nearly {{convert|6|mi|km}} to the east. Meanwhile Rupert had led the rest of the Royalist cavalry from Gloucester and, having rendezvoused with Wilmot, ended the day with some 5,000 men camped around [[Bourton-on-the-Water]], {{convert|4|mi|km}} south-west of Stow.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 141\u2013143, 146</ref> The next day the two forces clashed. Although Rupert enjoyed superior numbers, he was dissuaded from pressing his advantage by the appearance of [[Edmund Harvey]] with a regiment of Parliamentarian cavalry and two of infantry. When Essex arrived with the rest of the Parliamentarian army, Rupert was forced into a steady retreat to the area of [[Andoversford]] and [[Compton Abdale]], while Essex's army ended the day around [[Naunton]]. Rupert had been surprised by the size of Essex's force and the skill with which it was handled, and had completely failed in his mission to delay it.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 144\u2013147, 148</ref>\n\nIn Gloucester the Parliamentarians could see the evacuation of some 400 sick or wounded Royalists and the dispatch of some artillery away from the siege, but also the arrival of 2,000 infantry and 500 mounted reinforcements from Bristol. The defender's countermine reached outside the east gate, where they discovered and began boring down on the deeper Royalist mine, while inside the gate an earthwork was completed across the road and the buildings either side were turned into [[blockhouse]]s. They were critically low on gunpowder, but buoyed by the sight of fires lit on nearby Wainlode Hill signalling the approach of Essex. The Royalists, meanwhile, were readying the heavy guns to move.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 147\u2013148</ref>\n\nOn 5 September Essex took the quickest way off the open country of the Cotswold hills down into the relative safety of the Severn valley. This meant descending the steep escarpment at Prestbury Hill towards [[Cheltenham]], rather than heading directly to Gloucester. His lead elements began the difficult descent at dusk, but the baggage train and rearguard were forced to spend the night in worsening weather in the hills. Rupert, who appears to have expected a more direct march on Gloucester, was not in a position to harass the Parliamentarians, and returned to Gloucester. There he covered the Royalist army as it lifted the siege and withdrew to Matson, {{convert|2|mi|km}} south-east of the city. Charles had already departed his headquarters there and ridden ahead to [[Painswick]]. The defenders inside the city did not know how close Essex was and, not quite believing the siege was over, did not harry the retreating Royalists but remained vigilant behind their defences.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 148\u2013151</ref>\n\n==Aftermath==\nRoyalist casualties during the siege were claimed to be in the range of 1,000 to over 1,500, the Parliamentarian losses ranging from 30 to 50. Royalist sources concede 120 killed during the siege, with reports of sick and wounded giving numbers of 900, 400 and 300. [[Jon Day]] gives a conservative estimate of Royalist casualties as 1,200 killed, wounded and sick, with another 800 lost to desertion.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 155, 168</ref> The siege had come close to succeeding, and by the end of it the defenders were down to their last barrels of gunpowder. It is unlikely they would have been able to withstand an assault, but because of Charles's aversion to casualties, none was ever attempted. Massey's aggressive tactics were a critical factor in the successful defence of the city, and ensured that morale never dropped to the low levels witnessed before the siege began. The Royalists specifically identified his countermining as the reason for lifting the siege. The Royalist artillery proved inadequate to the task of siege work, and the 300\u2013400 large cannon balls and 20+ mortar bombs that were fired on the city failed to blow any major breach in the walls, start any significant fires or cause more than a handful of casualties.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 154\u2013155</ref>\n\nAlthough the failure at Gloucester adversely affected Royalist morale, the campaign presented Charles with an opportunity to inflict a decisive blow against his enemy. The Parliamentarian army and its trained band reserves had effectively been lured out of a strong position behind the London defences, into open country where they could be more easily defeated. Against a Parliamentarian army some 14,500 strong, the Royalist army of 9,000 infantry and 6,000 cavalry was slightly inferior in the quantity of infantry but superior in cavalry by a factor of three to two. The arrival of additional guns ordered from Oxford during the siege gave the Royalists parity in artillery.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 165, 167\u2013168</ref>\n\nEssex's objective after the siege was to evade the Royalist army and return his own intact to London. In a feint designed to draw Charles away from his intended route back to London, Essex marched north to [[Tewkesbury]], where he could better supply his army and threaten Royalist Worcester.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 171\u2013172</ref> When Charles marched his army after him, Essex retraced his steps back to Cheltenham.

It took place between 10 August and 5 September 1643, between the defending Parliamentarian garrison of [[Gloucester]] and the besieging army of [[Charles I of England|King Charles I]]. The siege ended with the arrival of a relieving Parliamentarian army under the [[Robert Devereux, 3rd Earl of Essex|Earl of Essex]]. The Royalist forces withdrew, having sustained heavy casualties and had several cannons disabled as a result of sallies made by the defenders.\n\n==Prelude==\nFollowing the Royalist defeat at the [[Battle of Edgehill]] in October 1642, King Charles I's control of the south was limited to [[Cornwall]], [[Wales]] and the [[Welsh Marches|Marches]], and a pocket of the [[Thames Valley]] around [[Oxford]], where he based his wartime capital.<ref>Day 2007 p. 29</ref> The ruling [[Puritans|Puritan]] elite of [[Gloucester]] ensured the city of some 5,000 inhabitants would be from the outset a staunchly Parliamentarian stronghold in the struggle against an anti-Puritan King and his [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] Queen.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 59\u201360</ref> Possession of Gloucester, along with [[Bristol]] to the south, threatened both Oxford and access to the Royalist recruiting grounds of Wales.<ref>Day 2007 p. 21</ref>\n\nAn unsuccessful attempt to rally Royalist support in [[Cirencester]] in August 1642 prompted Parliamentarians in [[Gloucestershire]] to muster the [[Militia (English)|militia]], and in November the first regular troops were garrisoned in Gloucester.<ref>Day 2007 p. 60</ref> In February 1643 the Royalist commander [[Prince Rupert of the Rhine|Prince Rupert]] easily defeated a militia garrison at Cirencester, prompting the Parliamentarians to recall their outposts at [[Berkeley, Gloucestershire|Berkeley]], [[Sudeley Castle|Sudeley]] and [[Tewkesbury]]. The next day Rupert appeared before Gloucester, but lacked the strength to enforce his demand for the city's surrender. Later that month an army of 2,000 Welshman led by [[Henry Somerset, 1st Duke of Beaufort|Lord Herbert of Raglan]] arrived on the west bank of the Severn opposite the city, but lacked the strength for an assault across the river. Its presence caused great consternation in Gloucester until a Parliamentarian army commanded by Sir [[William Waller]] defeated it on 24 March.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 60\u201362</ref>\n\nThe defeat of Waller in the [[Battle of Roundway Down]] on 13 July by the Royalist Western Army left both Bristol and Gloucester vulnerable, and on 18 July Rupert led another Royalist army out of Oxford to take control of the Severn valley. On 26 July Rupert's Oxford Army, supported by the Western Army, seized Bristol. Royalist casualties were high, and despite Rupert's instructions to the contrary, the victorious troops plundered the city.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 21\u201325</ref> Rupert was appointed governor of Bristol, but infighting within the Royalist leadership and concerns that an attack on Gloucester would result in the same high casualties prompted [[Charles I of England|King Charles I]] to travel to Bristol for a council of war.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 26\u201328</ref> He arrived on 2 August, and over the next five days consulted with his advisers on the best course of action. The strategic situation since Edgehill had improved significantly for the Royalists, with victories in the north of England, the arrival of reinforcements and materiel in June, and an opposition that had fallen into disarray.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 29\u201331</ref> Rupert's plan to consolidate the Royalist grip on the west by seizing Gloucester faced opposition from those in the King's camp, led by his wife Queen [[Henrietta Maria of France|Henrietta Maria]], who believed a march on London could end the war.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 51\u201353</ref>\n\nThe capture of Gloucester would give Charles some advantages. It would allow the Royalist garrisons farther up the Severn at [[Worcester]] and [[Shrewsbury]] to be supplied from Bristol, with consequent benefit to the economy of that city. Gloucestershire \u2013 populous, wealthy and Parliamentarian \u2013 could be punitively taxed, and Welsh manpower and money could be freely deployed against the King's enemies in the rest of the country. Although it was likely that Rupert would have been able to storm a city that was less well defended than Bristol, Charles was not willing to risk the casualties an assault would incur.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 54\u201355</ref> On 6 August the Parliamentarian governor of Gloucester, Lieutenant-Colonel [[Edward Massey]], refused to surrender the city, but in a secret communication he let it be known that he would do so if the King, rather than Rupert, led the army on Gloucester. Charles decided the next day that this was the best chance of securing Gloucester quickly and without bloodshed. This compromise plan pleased neither the Queen's faction, who saw it as an unnecessary diversion from the more decisive objective of London, nor Rupert, who remained in Bristol in the belief that the Royalist army was not strong enough to allow Massey to honourably surrender without a fight.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 55\u201357</ref>\n\n==Gloucester defences==\n[[File:SoG 1.jpg|thumb|upright=2|City defences during the siege in 1643]]\nGloucester's strength lay in its location. To the west, the River Severn formed a natural defence against an assaulting army. To the north and north-east the marshy ground was unsuitable for siege operations, and the River Twyver and a tributary stream added to the obstacles. This left the higher and drier ground to the east and south as the only feasible directions for an attack. In the preceding centuries the city had grown beyond its medieval defences, of which only the ruined [[Gloucester Castle|castle]] by the river and a stretch of wall that linked the south, east and original north fates, the last known as the inner north gate and now well within the city, still survived. From the south gate to the east gate the wall was high but not thick enough to withstand 17th-century artillery or mining operations.<ref name=Day65\u201366>Day 2007 pp. 65\u201366</ref>\n\nThe fall of Bristol prompted the hurried reinforcement of the existing defences. New earthworks and a narrow water-filled ditch completed the line of fortifications from the south gate to the Severn. Another earthwork was extended north from Whitefriars Barn on the north-east corner of the medieval wall to the outer north gate. From there the River Twyver formed a moat as the earthwork followed it north-west to Alvin Gate then on to the river's junction with the Old Severn.<ref name=Day65\u201366 /> This easternmost channel of the River Severn had dried up by the 19th century, but at the time of the civil war it was still a navigable river.<ref>Herbert 1988 para. 2</ref><ref>Rhodes 2006 p. 14</ref> The earthwork then followed the Old Severn south-west to a point a short distance north of Westgate Street, from where it was extended the other side of the Old Severn to the River Severn just above the west gate.<ref name=Day66>Day 2007 p. 66</ref> Inside the city, an earthwork was extended west from the end of the medieval wall at the inner north gate via [[Gloucester Cathedral]] to [[St Oswald's Priory, Gloucester|St Oswald's Priory]], where it met the new outer earthwork.<ref name=Day66 /> The outer north gate and Alvin Gate were fortified with earthwork [[bastion]]s,<ref name=Day66 /> a drawbridge was installed at Westgate Bridge and the Old Severn was dammed at Dockham, causing the ground to north-west of the city to flood.<ref>Rhodes 2006 pp. 17, 29\u201330</ref>\n\nThe garrison numbered no more than 1,500 troops. The bulk of these comprised two half-strength regiments each of some 600 men: the [[Henry Grey, 1st Earl of Stamford|Earl of Stamford]]'s Regiment of Foot, recruited from London and Leicestershire, and a locally recruited regiment known as the Town Regiment. The remainder comprised a company of [[Trained bands|trained band]], 100 [[dragoon]]s and a [[troop]] of cavalry. The city's dozen or so artillery pieces ranged in size from light cannon to two nine-pounder [[demi-culverin]]s. Stamford's regiment was experienced and well led, though of uncertain discipline. The Town Regiment lacked experience but was motivated by its ties to the city it was defending, although there is evidence that some of its men would refuse to oppose the King. The city could support itself with basic necessities, but it lacked sufficient gunpowder to withstand an assault or prolonged siege.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 63\u201365</ref>\n\nMassey was an autocratic military commander, but his authority in the city was shared with the civilian administration. A committee had been established in December 1642 to manage the Parliamentarian war effort in the county, but [[Thomas Pury]], the [[member of parliament]] for Gloucester, was the only committee member in the city. Civic authority was held by a forty-member council, though in practice an inner core of some fifteen [[Alderman|aldermen]], including the mayor, wielded power. As many of these were, like Pury, officers in the city's garrison, political and military command was largely integrated.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 66\u201367</ref> In the days immediately following the fall of Bristol, morale in the city, both military and civilian, was low.<ref>Day 2007 p. 68</ref> It's possible that this was what prompted Massey consider surrendering the city, though his message suggesting he would may have been a subterfuge designed to buy some time.<ref>Day 2007 p. 73</ref> There is strong evidence that the conduct and actions of the city elite, including Massey and particularly Pury, did much to stiffen the city's resolve. Officers and councillors with Royalist sympathies were given the opportunity to leave, and those who remained were required to restate an oath of allegiance to Parliament. The discipline of the troops was improved by paying them, and civilians were kept busy reinforcing the city's defences.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 69\u201370</ref>\n\n==Siege==\nAs Charles marched north from Bristol, reinforcements were converging on Gloucester from Oxford, Worcester and Herefordshire.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 86\u201387</ref> By the afternoon of 10 August the Royalist army, comprising some 6,000 infantry and 2,500 mounted troops, began assembling around the city.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 90\u201391</ref> Charles set up his headquarters at [[Matson, Gloucester|Matson]] House.<ref>Day 2007 p. 97</ref> His demand for Gloucester's surrender was unanimously and somewhat insolently rejected, and the Parliamentarians set fire to the suburbs outside the city defences to clear lines of fire and deprive the Royalists of cover.<ref>Day 2007 pp. , 91\u201393,96</ref> Charles had decided to march on Gloucester in the belief that the city would be quickly surrendered. Now that gambit had failed, he decided to besiege it. His pride had been wounded by the manner of the Parliamentarian rejection. His commanders, assessing the state of the city's defences, supplies and morale, persuaded him the city could be taken within ten days without an assault. Intelligence indicated the even if the Parliamentarians were able to send a relieving force, it could be easily defeated before it could reach the city. Most decisively, the [[William Cavendish, 1st Duke of Newcastle|Earl of Newcastle]], whose support was necessary in any campaign against London, declared himself unable to march south while Hull remained in Parliamentarian hands, leaving Charles too weak to contemplate such a move.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 93\u201395</ref>\n\n===First ten days===\n\n[[File:SoG 2.jpg|thumb|upright=2|Royalist dispositions during the siege]]\nThe first shots were fired in the afternoon as Sir [[Jacob Astley, 1st Baron Astley of Reading|Jacob Astley]] established his forces near Issold's House on the eastern side of the city. [[Patrick Ruthven, 1st Earl of Forth|Lord Forth]], who had been given overall command of the siege, set up a fortified leaguer to the rear of the ruined [[Llanthony Secunda Priory]] and established his forces to the south of the city.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 95\u201396, 99, 100\u2013101</ref> By dawn on 11 August, a line of trenches had been dug some {{convert|130|yd|m}} from the walls, placing the two sides within musket range of each other, stretching from [[Brunswick Square, Gloucester|Gaudy Green]] on the south side to Issold's House on the east.<ref>Day 2007 p. 99</ref> Massey responded with spoiling tactics in an attempt to hinder Royalist siege operations and delay the assault he was expecting. At midnight a small raiding party succeeded in disrupting Royalist entrenching operations on Gaudy Green, and a larger raid on the green the next morning, 12 August, resulted in the capture of Royalist men, tools and weapons.<ref>Day 2007 p. 100</ref> By this time, the reinforcements from Herefordshire and Worcester under the command of Sir William Vavasour arrived on the west bank of the Severn and began crossing the river to take up positions at Kingsholm, to the north of the city. This force increased the size of the besieging army by another 2,400 infantry and over 300 cavalry. They too were the target of a Parliamentarian raid which inflicted up to fifteen casualties on the Royalists.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 10, 100</ref>\n\nLater on 12 August, Forth completed an earthwork square on Gaudy Green, in which he placed two 24-pounders, the largest of the Royalist's eight cannon, along with a 12-pounder to target the south wall. Another artillery emplacement was positioned to target the east wall nearby.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 10, 99\u2013102</ref> With the artillery in place, the Royalists began bombarding the walls, with the main effort beginning at 11:00 on 13 August. The cannon were too light to have any significant impact, and of the two mortars the Royalists possessed, one, reputed to be the largest in the country, exploded on its first use. When it became evident the Royalists were focusing their efforts on the south-east corner of the city defences, Massey quickly buttressed the medieval walls with up to {{convert|5|ft|m}} of earth, which ensured that the defences held. Meanwhile, the majority of Vavasour's troops completed their crossing of the Severn, leaving behind a small contingent to blockade the west bank.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 100\u2013102</ref>\n\nReacting to rumours that Vavasour had received a reinforcement of artillery, the Parliamentarians mounted another raid to the north of the city on 14 August. They captured two prisoners but failed in their primary objective of locating and spiking any guns.<ref>Day 2007 p. 102</ref> The Royalist bombardment continued through 14 August, but a breach blown in the wall by the larger guns on Gaudy Green was quickly plugged by the defenders with woolsacks and [[gabion]]s. Royalist engineers mining towards the walls from trenches at the green succeeded in draining the ditch below the walls, but this was not followed up with an assault. By the end of the day the Royalist guns had fallen silent; the evidence suggests they had run out of ammunition.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 102\u2013103</ref>\n\nThe following day Vavasour received a reinforcement of 500 [[Glamorgan]] militia and 450 musketeers from Bristol, while the Parliamentarians bolstered the earthwork defences around the south and north gates. On 16 August Rupert accompanied Charles to Oxford, and neither were at Gloucester to witness the most ambitious Parliamentarian raid yet. Just before sunset, 150 musketeers of Stamford's regiment sallied out of the north gate to attack the Royalist trenches east of the city. The Parliamentarians claimed 100 Royalist killed for the cost of 2 injured, while Royalist sources report 24 Parliamentarians killed and more wounded, for the loss of 4 Royalists killed.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 103\u2013105</ref>\n\nStruggling with a shortage of gunpowder and with the guns quiet, the Royalists concentrated on mining operations to breach the city walls. Miners recruited from the [[Forest of Dean]] were set to work under a protective gallery to fill the {{convert|12|ft|m|adj=on}} deep by {{convert|30|ft|m|adj=on}} wide moat which, when completed, would allow them to undermine the walls. It was slow work, estimated to need a week to complete. The faster alternative was to forgo the protection and fill the moat with [[fascine]]s. An attempt to do this was beaten back by musket fire from the walls, and resulted in the desertion of the miners.<ref>Day 2007 103, 106\u2013107</ref>\n\nBy 18 August Vavasour had deployed three cannon in front of his main camp at Kingsholm and another opposite Alvin Gate. These were the targets of a Parliamentarian raid that morning that was even larger than previous efforts; a diversionary attack by 50 men and a main force of 400. All four of Vavasour's cannon were disabled, the Parliamentarians claiming over 100 Royalist casualties for the loss of 6, the Royalists admitting 28 casualties and claiming to have killed 27 Parliamentarians. Another Parliamentarian raid the same day involved their only recorded use of cavalry during the siege, when 150 musketeers and 40 cavalry mounted an ineffectual attack on Royalist positions to the east of the city. Charles, meanwhile, was on his way back to Gloucester with another 1,000 reinforcements.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 106\u2013107</ref>\n\nBy the morning of 19 August, two 6-pounder cannon had been installed in a third emplacement opposite the east gate, bringing all the original artillery online. At 10:00, the bombardment was resumed in a last effort to subdue the city by the original ten-day deadline. Constrained by the limited supplies of ammunition and gunpowder, the bombardment had little material effect, though it prompted Massey to hastily erect a breastwork in the open ground of Friar's Orchard, at the south east corner of the city where the Royalist artillery was being concentrated. A Royalist attempt to cross the moat after dark was beaten back by musket fire. The objective of forcing the surrender of Gloucester by siege in ten days had failed, partly due to the city's resolve and Massey's spoiling attacks, but mainly due to the inadequacy of the Royalist artillery.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 107\u2013109</ref>\n\n===Shift of focus to mining===\n\nThe Parliamentarians mounted another raid at dawn on 21 August. It was a two-pronged attack designed to disable the Royalist artillery south and east of the walls. One detachment travelled by boat down the Severn, landed between Forth's camp and a redoubt opposite the castle and successfuly stormed the redoubt. The second detachment of 200 musketeers sallied from the north gate. Intending first to attack the battery opposite the east gate, this force became lost and blundered into Royalist infantry camps. When Massey saw that the raid was not going to plan, he sounded the recall. The Parliamentarians suffered eight casualties, the Royalists more than twenty. Such raids were proving risky and wasteful of the garrison's limited ammunition, and this was the last large-scale operation mounted by the Parliamentarians.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 112\u2013113</ref>\n\nAs the Royalists set about replenishing their stocks of ammunition, they intensified their mining efforts. It was anticipated that the original effort to bridge the moat would allow the besiegers to reach the east wall on 24 August. A second effort to bridge the moat to the south was begun, as was a more complicated project to tunnel towards the east gate. Royalist agents attempted to persuade the garrison to surrender, and Royalist cavalry staged a mock battle in an unsuccessful attempt to lure the garrison out of the city in the belief that a relief force had arrived.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 114\u2013115</ref> A desultory bombardment was maintained, particularly by the mortars, until 25 August, when it was intensified. An attempt that day by Massey to disrupt it with a sally from the north gate was beaten back by cavalry, but as before, a shortage of ammunition \u2013 at one stage the Royalists resorted to firing stones \u2013 blunted the impact, and little damage was done to the city.<ref>Day 2007 p. 116</ref>\n\nFollowing news that the [[Robert Devereux, 3rd Earl of Essex|Earl of Essex]] was raising a Parliamentarian army in London, Charles and Rupert travelled to Oxford on 26 August, where they held a two-day council of war. With no intelligence of Essex's plans, the Royalists bolstered the defences of Oxford with troops earmarked for the siege of Gloucester while the Royalist garrison at Bristol was urged to send all the forces it could spare to Gloucester. Believing that Essex could muster no more than 6,000 troops, the decision was made to continue the siege, though contingency plans for the blockade of Gloucester were drawn up in case it had to be lifted. [[Henry Wilmot, 1st Earl of Rochester|Lord Wilmot]] was instructed to muster 2,000 cavalry around [[Banbury]]. Their task would be to delay the Parliamentarians in the [[Cotswolds]] until Rupert could come up with the rest of the Royalist cavalry in support, should Essex march to the relief of Gloucester.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 117\u2013118</ref>\n\nEssex began his march from [[Colnbrook]], west of London, on 26 August.<ref>Day 2007 p. 127</ref> His plan was to relieve Gloucester without provoking a major battle in which, with the Royalist superiority in cavalry, he would be at a disdvantage. His route was dictated by the desire to minimise the amount of open country favourable to cavalry operations he would have to pass through, and took him north of Oxford via Aylesbury and Bicester and then across the Cotswolds.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 124\u2013126</ref> At the beginning of September Essex was due north of Oxford with an army of some 10,500 infantry, no more than 4,500 mounted troops and an artillery train that is estimated at no more than 50 guns.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 130\u2013131, 133</ref>\n\nMining was now the principal tactic by which the Royalists hoped to bring the siege to a successful conclusion. Priority was given to tunnelling at the east gate, which caused progress on efforts to fill the moat below the south and east walls to slow, possibly as a result of a lack of miners and engineers. Parliamentarian countermining at the east gate on 28 August was quickly abandoned because of springs that caused flooding, which accounts for the slow pace of the Royalist efforts there.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 136\u2013138</ref> Massey continued to harass the besiegers with sniping and artillery fire, and he resumed countermining operations at the east gate after a reconnaissance party had reported Royalists miners were still working on their mine. The progress of the Royalist mines closer towards the walls, quickened by the arrival of Welsh miners on 29 August, led Massey to believe an assault was imminent. On 1 September he fortified Friars Orchard with an earthwork wall and [[Sconce (fortification)|sconce]], a fort in which he placed four pieces of artillery that could be brought to bear on any Royalists who broke through the south-east corner or the east gate.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 138\u2013140</ref>\n\nOn 3 September the Parliamentarians placed a [[Saker (cannon)|saker]] in a gun port they had been secretly building in east wall above the gallery protecting the Royalist miners. The medium-sized cannon was employed most of the day against the gallery, to little effect, until the Royalists targeted it with a cannon of their own, at which point it was withdrawn. The Royalists anticipated their mine would reach the east gate the next day, while they believed Essex could be delayed in the Cotswolds for four days. The Bristol garrison was being stripped for reinforcements and orders had been sent to Oxford for ten field guns and the equipment necessary to make the guns already at Gloucester mobile, should it become necessary to redeploy them from siegework to use in open battle.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 140\u2013141</ref>\n\n===Approach of the relief army===\n\nBy the end of 3 September Essex's lead element, the London brigade, was at [[Oddington, Gloucestershire|Oddington]], {{convert|2|mi|km}} east of [[Stow-on-the-Wold]]. The Parliamentarian army was largely untroubled by Wilmot's Royalist cavalry, and because of the differing rates of march it was strung out as far back as [[Chipping Norton]], nearly {{convert|6|mi|km}} to the east. Meanwhile Rupert had led the rest of the Royalist cavalry from Gloucester and, having rendezvoused with Wilmot, ended the day with some 5,000 men camped around [[Bourton-on-the-Water]], {{convert|4|mi|km}} south-west of Stow.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 141\u2013143, 146</ref> The next day the two forces clashed. Although Rupert enjoyed superior numbers, he was dissuaded from pressing his advantage by the appearance of [[Edmund Harvey]] with a regiment of Parliamentarian cavalry and two of infantry. When Essex arrived with the rest of the Parliamentarian army, Rupert was forced into a steady retreat to the area of [[Andoversford]] and [[Compton Abdale]], while Essex's army ended the day around [[Naunton]]. Rupert had been surprised by the size of Essex's force and the skill with which it was handled, and had completely failed in his mission to delay it.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 144\u2013147, 148</ref>\n\nIn Gloucester the Parliamentarians could see the evacuation of some 400 sick or wounded Royalists and the dispatch of some artillery away from the siege, but also the arrival of 2,000 infantry and 500 mounted reinforcements from Bristol. The defender's countermine reached outside the east gate, where they discovered and began boring down on the deeper Royalist mine, while inside the gate an earthwork was completed across the road and the buildings either side were turned into [[blockhouse]]s. They were critically low on gunpowder, but buoyed by the sight of fires lit on nearby Wainlode Hill signalling the approach of Essex. The Royalists, meanwhile, were readying the heavy guns to move.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 147\u2013148</ref>\n\nOn 5 September Essex took the quickest way off the open country of the Cotswold hills down into the relative safety of the Severn valley. This meant descending the steep escarpment at Prestbury Hill towards [[Cheltenham]], rather than heading directly to Gloucester. His lead elements began the difficult descent at dusk, but the baggage train and rearguard were forced to spend the night in worsening weather in the hills. Rupert, who appears to have expected a more direct march on Gloucester, could do little to harass the Parliamentarians, and returned to Gloucester. There he covered the Royalist army as it lifted the siege and withdrew to Matson, {{convert|2|mi|km}} south-east of the city. Charles had already departed his headquarters there and ridden ahead to [[Painswick]]. The defenders inside the city did not know how close Essex was and, not quite believing the siege was over, did not harry the retreating Royalists but remained vigilant behind their defences.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 148\u2013151</ref>\n\n==Aftermath==\nRoyalist casualties during the siege were claimed to be in the range of 1,000 to over 1,500, the Parliamentarian losses ranging from 30 to 50. Royalist sources concede 120 killed during the siege, with reports of sick and wounded giving numbers of 900, 400 and 300. [[Jon Day]] gives a conservative estimate of Royalist casualties as 1,200 killed, wounded and sick, with another 800 lost to desertion.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 155, 168</ref> The siege had come close to succeeding, and by the end of it the defenders were down to their last barrels of gunpowder. It is unlikely they would have been able to withstand an assault, but because of Charles's aversion to casualties, none was ever attempted. Massey's aggressive tactics were a critical factor in the successful defence of the city, and ensured that morale never dropped to the low levels witnessed before the siege began. The Royalists specifically identified his countermining as the reason for lifting the siege. The Royalist artillery proved inadequate to the task of siege work, and the 300\u2013400 large cannon balls and 20+ mortar bombs that were fired on the city failed to blow any major breach in the walls, start any significant fires or cause more than a handful of casualties.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 154\u2013155</ref>\n\nAlthough the failure at Gloucester adversely affected Royalist morale, the campaign presented Charles with an opportunity to inflict a decisive blow against his enemy. The Parliamentarian army and its trained band reserves had effectively been lured out of a strong position behind the London defences, into open country where they could be more easily defeated. Against a Parliamentarian army some 14,500 strong, the Royalist army of 9,000 infantry and 6,000 cavalry was slightly inferior in the quantity of infantry but superior in cavalry by a factor of three to two. The arrival of additional guns ordered from Oxford during the siege gave the Royalists parity in artillery.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 165, 167\u2013168</ref>\n\nEssex's objective after the siege was to evade the Royalist army and return his own intact to London. In a feint designed to draw Charles away from his intended route back to London, Essex marched north to [[Tewkesbury]], where he could better supply his army and threaten Royalist Worcester.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 171\u2013172</ref> When Charles marched his army after him, Essex retraced his steps back to Cheltenham. With the Royalists concentrated around [[Evesham]] and [[Pershore]], he struck out back across the Cotswolds in the direction of Cirencester, where he defeated the 400-strong Royalist garrison on 16 September.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 175, 177\u2013178</ref>\n\nEssex believed he had etablished a commanding lead over Charles and, not wishing to drive his hungry army too hard, slowed his pace on the march to [[Swindon]].<ref>Day 2007 pp. 184\u2013185</ref> He was further slowed after Swindon when Rupert's cavalry caught up, and the resulting [[Battle of Aldbourne Chase]] on 18 September allowed the rest of the Royalist army to close the distance.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 186\u2013192</ref> Charles finally brought Essex to battle on 20 September in the [[First Battle of Newbury]], but failed to defeat him, allowing the Parliamentarians to reach the safety of their London stronghold four days later.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 226, 269, 280</ref>\n\n==Legacy==\nProfessor [[David Daube]] suggested in ''[[The Oxford Magazine]]'' of 16 February 1956 that the nursery rhyme [[Humpty Dumpty]] originated from a [[siege engine]] used at Gloucester, based on a contemporary account of the attack, but without evidence that the rhyme was connected.<ref>Daube 2009 pp. 365\u2013366.</ref> The theory was part of an anonymous series of articles on the origin of nursery rhymes and was widely acclaimed in academia,<ref>Rodger 1999</ref> but it was derided by others as \"ingenuity for ingenuity's sake\" and declared to be a spoof.<ref>Opie 1997 p. 254</ref><ref>Opie 2004 p. 76.</ref>\n\nFor centuries afterwards, the lifting of the siege was marked by an annual [[Gloucester Day]]. This died out in the nineteenth century but was reinstated in 2009.<ref name=bbc>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/gloucestershire/8239588.stm Tradition revived for city pride.] BBC News, 5 September 2009.

Balderston]], which in turn is adapted from the 1897 novel ''[[Dracula]]'' by [[Bram Stoker]].<ref>[[David J. Skal|Skal, David J.]] (2004).

The film was partially shot on sets at [[Universal Studios Lot]] in California, which were reused at night for the filming of ''[[Dracula (1931 Spanish-language film)|Dr\u00e1cula]]'', a concurrently produced Spanish-language version of the story also by Universal. \n\n''Dracula'' was a commercial and critical success upon release, and led to several [[sequel]]s and [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]]s. It has had a notable influence on popular culture, and Lugosi's portrayal of Dracula established the character as a [[cultural icon]], as well as the archetypal vampire in later works of fiction. In 2000, the film was selected by the United States [[Library of Congress]] for preservation in the [[National Film Registry]] as \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".\n\n== Plot ==\n[[Renfield]] ([[Dwight Frye]]) is a solicitor traveling to Count Dracula's ([[Bela Lugosi]]) castle in [[Transylvania]] on a business matter. The people in the local village fear that vampires inhabit the castle and warn Renfield not to go there. Renfield refuses to stay at the inn and asks his carriage driver to take him to the [[Borgo Pass]]. Renfield is driven to the castle by Dracula's coach, with Dracula disguised as the driver. En route, Renfield sticks his head out the window to ask the driver to slow down, but sees the driver has disappeared; a bat leads the horses.\n\nRenfield enters the castle welcomed by the charming but eccentric Count, who, unbeknownst to Renfield, is a [[vampire]]. They discuss Dracula's intention to lease Carfax [[Abbey]] in [[London]], where he intends to travel the next day. Dracula hypnotizes Renfield into opening a window. Renfield faints as a bat appears and Dracula's three wives close in on him. Dracula waves them away, then attacks Renfield himself.\n\nAboard the [[schooner]] ''Vesta'', Renfield is a raving lunatic slave to Dracula, who hides in a coffin and feeds on the ship's crew. When the ship reaches England, Renfield is discovered to be the only living person. Renfield is sent to [[John Seward|Dr. Seward]]'s [[sanatorium]] adjoining Carfax Abbey.\n\nAt a London theatre, Dracula meets Seward ([[Herbert Bunston]]). Seward introduces his daughter [[Mina Harker|Mina]] ([[Helen Chandler]]), her fianc\u00e9 [[Jonathan Harker|John Harker]] ([[David Manners]]) and the family friend [[Lucy Westenra|Lucy Weston]] ([[Frances Dade]]). Lucy is fascinated by Count Dracula. That night, Dracula enters her room and feasts on her blood while she sleeps. Lucy dies the next day after a string of transfusions.\n\nRenfield is obsessed with eating flies and spiders. [[Abraham Van Helsing|Professor Van Helsing]] ([[Edward Van Sloan]]) analyzes Renfield's blood and discovers his obsession. He starts talking about vampires, and that afternoon Renfield begs Seward to send him away, claiming his nightly cries may disturb Mina's dreams. When Dracula calls Renfield with wolf howling, Renfield is disturbed by Van Helsing showing him [[Aconitum|wolfsbane]], which Van Helsing says is used for protection from vampires.\n\nDracula visits Mina, asleep in her bedroom, and bites her. The next evening, Dracula enters for a visit and Van Helsing and Harker notice that he does not have a reflection. When Van Helsing reveals this to Dracula, he smashes the mirror and leaves. Van Helsing deduces that Dracula is the vampire behind the recent tragedies.\n\nMina leaves her room and runs to Dracula in the garden, where he attacks her. She is found by the maid. Newspapers report that a woman in white is luring children from the park and biting them. Mina recognizes the lady as Lucy, risen as a vampire. Harker wants to take Mina to London for safety, but is convinced to leave Mina with Van Helsing. Van Helsing orders Nurse Briggs ([[Joan Standing]]) to take care of Mina when she sleeps, and not to remove the wreath of wolfsbane from her neck.\n\nRenfield escapes from his cell and listens to the men discuss vampires. Before his attendant takes Renfield back to his cell, Renfield relates to them how Dracula convinced Renfield to allow him to enter the sanitorium by promising him thousands of rats with blood and life in them. Dracula enters the Seward parlour and talks with Van Helsing. Dracula states that Mina now belongs to him, and warns Van Helsing to return to [[Netherlands|his home country]]. Van Helsing swears to excavate Carfax Abbey and destroy Dracula. Dracula attempts to hypnotize Van Helsing, but the latter's resolve proves stronger. As Dracula lunges at Van Helsing, he withdraws a crucifix from his coat, forcing Dracula to retreat.\n\nHarker visits Mina on a terrace, and she speaks of how much she loves \"nights and fogs\". A bat flies above them and squeaks to Mina. She then attacks Harker but Van Helsing and Seward save him. Mina confesses what Dracula has done to her, and tells Harker their love is finished.\n\nDracula hypnotizes Briggs into removing the wolfsbane from Mina's neck and opening the windows. Van Helsing and Harker see Renfield heading for Carfax Abbey. They see Dracula with Mina in the abbey. When Harker shouts to Mina, Dracula thinks Renfield has led them there. Renfield pleads for his life, but Dracula kills him. Dracula is hunted by Van Helsing and Harker, who know that Dracula is forced to sleep in his coffin during daylight, and the sun is rising. Van Helsing prepares a wooden stake while Harker searches for Mina. Van Helsing impales Dracula through the heart, killing him, and Mina returns to normal.\n\n== Cast ==\n[[File:Bela Lugosi as Dracula, anonymous photograph from 1931, Universal Studios.jpg|right|thumb|upright|[[Bela Lugosi]] as Dracula]]\n{{Cast list |\n* [[Bela Lugosi]] as [[Count Dracula]]\n* [[Helen Chandler]] as [[Mina Harker|Mina Seward]]\n* [[David Manners]] as [[Jonathan Harker|John Harker]]\n* [[Dwight Frye]] as [[Renfield]]\n* [[Edward Van Sloan]] as [[Abraham Van Helsing|Van Helsing]]\n* [[Herbert Bunston]] as [[John Seward|Dr. Seward]]\n* [[Frances Dade]] as [[Lucy Westenra|Lucy Weston]]\n* [[Joan Standing]] as Nurse Briggs (in an error on the [[opening credits]], she is misidentified as \"Maid\")<ref name=\"DVD\" />\n* [[Charles K.

W. Murnau]]. Bram Stoker's widow sued for [[plagiarism]] and [[copyright infringement]], and the courts decided in her favor, essentially ordering that all [[release print|prints]] of ''Nosferatu'' be destroyed.<ref name=\"DVD\" /> Enthusiastic young Hollywood producer [[Carl Laemmle, Jr.]] also saw the box office potential in Stoker's gothic chiller, and he legally acquired the novel's film rights. Initially, he wanted ''Dracula'' to be a spectacle on a scale with the lavish silent films ''[[The Hunchback of Notre Dame (1923 film)|The Hunchback of Notre Dame]]'' (1923) and ''[[The Phantom of the Opera (1925 film)|The Phantom of the Opera]]'' (1925).\n\nAlready a huge hit on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]], the Deane/Balderston ''Dracula'' play would become the blueprint as the production gained momentum. The screenwriters carefully studied the silent, unauthorized version, [[F. W. Murnau]]'s ''[[Nosferatu]]'', for inspiration. Lifted directly from a nearly identical scene in ''Nosferatu'' that does not appear in Stoker's novel, was the early scene at the Count's castle when Renfield accidentally pricks his finger on a paper clip and it starts to bleed. Dracula creeps toward him with glee, only to be repelled when the crucifix falls in front of the bleeding finger.\n\n== Production ==\n[[File:Dracula1931BelaLugosiColor.png|thumb|Colorized still of [[Bela Lugosi]] as Dracula and [[Edward Van Sloan]] as Van Helsing]]\nDecision on casting the title role proved problematic. Initially, Laemmle was not at all interested in Lugosi, in spite of good reviews for his stage portrayal. Laemmle instead considered other actors, including [[Paul Muni]], [[Chester Morris]], [[Ian Keith]], [[John Wray (actor)|John Wray]], [[Joseph Schildkraut]], [[Arthur Edmund Carewe]], and [[William Courtenay (actor)|William Courtenay]]. Lugosi had played the role on Broadway,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/26/movies/homevideo/universal-classic-monsters-puts-horror-on-parade.html|title='Universal Classic Monsters' Puts Horror on Parade|last=Hoberman|first=J.|author-link=J.

Skal]], [[David Manners]] (Jonathan Harker) claims he was so unimpressed with the chaotic production, he never once watched the film in the remaining 67 years of his life.

This was because when Bram Stoker wrote the original novel, the [[Tihu\u021ba Pass|Borgo Pass]] was near [[Transylvania]] and modern [[Hungary]]. This part of the world was then part of the [[Kingdom of Hungary]] and within the [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian Empire]].

Photographed at [[silent film#Projection speed|silent film projection speed]], this accounts for the jerky, sped-up appearance of the footage when projected at 24 frames per second sound film speed and cobbled together with new footage of Dracula and Renfield.<ref name=\"DVD\" /> [[Jack Foley (sound effects)|Jack Foley]] was the [[foley artist]] who produced the sound effects.<ref>Jackson, Blair (September 1, 2005) [http://mixonline.com/mag/audio_foley_recording/ \"Foley Recording\"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629141111/http://mixonline.com/mag/audio_foley_recording/ |date=June 29, 2011 }} ''Mix'' (magazine), accessed July 1, 2010</ref>\n\n=== Cinematic process ===\nThe film's histrionic dramatics from the stage play are also reflected in its [[special effect]]s, which are limited to fog, lighting, and large flexible bats. Dracula's transition from bat to person is always done off-camera. The film also employs extended periods of silence and character close-ups for dramatic effect, and employs two expository  [[intertitles]] and a closeup of a newspaper article to advance the story, a seeming holdover from [[silent film]]s;  a point made by online [[film critic]] [[James Berardinelli]]<ref>[http://preview.reelviews.net/movies/d/dracula31.html Review (2000)] by [[James Berardinelli]] at ReelViews.net</ref> is that the actors' performance style seems to belong to the silent era. Director [[Tod Browning]] had a solid reputation as a silent film director, having made them since 1915, but he never felt completely at ease with sound films.<ref name=\"DVD\" /> He only directed six more films over an eight-year period, the best known being the notorious ''[[Freaks (1932 film)|Freaks]]'', a horror movie with [[Olga Baclanova|Baclanova]] and a cast of actual carnival freaks that was yanked from distribution immediately. Browning directed his last film in 1939.\n\n== Music ==\nOwing to the costs of adding an original musical score to a film's soundtrack, no score had ever been composed specifically for the film.<ref name=ebert /> The music heard during the opening credits, an excerpt from Act II of [[Tchaikovsky]]'s ''[[Swan Lake]]'', was re-used in 1932 for another Universal horror film, ''[[The Mummy (1932 film)|The Mummy]]''. During the theatre scene where Dracula meets Dr. Seward, Harker, Mina, and Lucy, the end of the overture to [[Wagner]]'s ''[[Die Meistersinger von N\u00fcrnberg]]'' can also be heard as well as the dark opening of [[Symphony No. 8 (Schubert)|Schubert's \"Unfinished Symphony\" in B minor]].\n\n=== 1998 score ===\nIn 1998, composer [[Philip Glass]] was commissioned to compose a musical score for the classic film. The score was performed by the [[Kronos Quartet]]<ref name=ebert /> under the direction of Michael Reisman, Glass's usual conductor.\n\nOf the project, Glass said: \"The film is considered a classic. I felt the score needed to evoke the feeling of the world of the 19th century \u2014 for that reason I decided a string quartet would be the most evocative and effective. I wanted to stay away from the obvious effects associated with horror films. With [the Kronos Quartet] we were able to add depth to the emotional layers of the film.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1999-aug-26-ca-3726-story.html|title=Lugosi's 'Dracula' and 'Living Dead' Get a Jump on Halloween|last=King|first=Susan|date=August 26, 1999|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|access-date=January 19, 2020}}</ref>\n\nThe film, with this new score, was released by [[Universal Studios]] in 1999 in the [[VHS]] format. Universal's [[DVD]] releases allow the viewer to choose between the unscored soundtrack or the Glass score.

In spite of the literary credentials of the source material, it was uncertain if an American audience was prepared for a serious full length supernatural chiller. Though American audiences had been exposed to other chillers before, such as ''[[The Cat and the Canary (1927 film)|The Cat and the Canary]]'' (1927), this was a horror story with no comic relief or trick ending that downplayed the supernatural. Despite this, ''Dracula'' proved to be a box office success.\n\nWhen the film finally premiered at the [[Roxy Theatre (New York City)|Roxy Theatre]] in New York City on February 12, 1931 (released two days later throughout the U.S.),<ref name=\"Sin42\" /> newspapers reported that members of the audiences fainted in shock at the horror on screen. This publicity, shrewdly orchestrated by the film studio, helped ensure people came to see the film, if for no other reason than curiosity. Within 48 hours of its opening at New York's Roxy Theatre, it had sold 50,000 tickets,<ref name=\"Sin42\" /> building a momentum that culminated in a $700,000 profit, the largest of Universal's 1931 releases.{{sfn|Vieira|2003|p=35}}\n\n=== Critical reception ===\nThe film was generally well received by critics upon its release. [[Mordaunt Hall]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' called it \"the best of the many mystery films\", characterizing Browning's direction as \"imaginative\" and Helen Chandler's performance as \"excellent\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1931/02/13/archives/the-screen-bram-stokers-human-vampire.html|title=The Screen; Bram Stoker's Human Vampire|last=Hall|first=Mordaunt|author-link=Mordaunt Hall|date=February 13, 1931|work=[[The New York Times]]|access-date=December 7, 2014}}</ref> ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' praised the film for its \"remarkably effective background of creepy atmosphere\" and wrote, \"It is difficult to think of anybody who could quite match the performance in the vampire part of Bela Lugosi, even to the faint flavor of foreign speech that fits so neatly\".<ref>{{cite magazine |last= |first= |date=February 18, 1931 |title=Dracula |url= |magazine=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |location=New York |publisher=Variety, Inc. |page=14 |access-date= }}</ref> ''[[Film Daily]]'' declared the film \"a fine [[melodrama]]\" and remarked that Lugosi had created \"one of the most unique and powerful roles of the screen\".<ref>{{cite journal |last= |first= |date=February 15, 1931 |title=Dracula |url= |journal=[[Film Daily]] |location=New York |publisher=Wid's Films and Film Folk, Inc. |page=11 |access-date= }}</ref> ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' called it \"an exciting melodrama, not as good as it ought to be but a cut above the ordinary trapdoor-and-winding-sheet type of mystery film\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.film.com/movies/whats-the-big-deal-dracula-1931 |title=What's the Big Deal?

The Count returned to life in three more Universal films of the mid-1940s: 1944's ''[[House of Frankenstein (1944 film)|House of Frankenstein]]'', 1945's ''[[House of Dracula]]'' and 1948's comedy ''[[Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein]]''. Universal would only cast Lugosi as Dracula in one more film, the aforesaid [[Abbott and Costello]] vehicle,{{sfn|Fitzgerald|1977|p=60}} giving the role to [[John Carradine]] for the mid-1940s \"monster rally\" films, although Carradine admittedly more closely resembled Stoker's physical description from the book. Many of the familiar images of Dracula are from stills of the older Lugosi made during the filming of the 1948 comedy, so there remain two confusingly distinct incarnations of Lugosi as Dracula, seventeen years apart in age. As Lugosi played a vampire in three other movies during his career,{{efn|Lugosi played vampires in ''[[Mark of the Vampire]]'' (1935), ''[[The Return of the Vampire]]'' (1943) and ''[[Mother Riley Meets the Vampire]]'' (1952).{{sfn|Fitzgerald|1977|p=60}}}} this contributed to the public misconception that he portrayed Dracula on film many times.\n\nSince its release, ''Dracula'' has become widely regarded as a classic of the era and of its genre. In 2000, it was selected for preservation in the U.S. [[National Film Registry]] by the [[Library of Congress]] as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.loc.gov/programs/national-film-preservation-board/film-registry/complete-national-film-registry-listing/|title=Complete National Film Registry Listing|publisher=[[Library of Congress]]|access-date=January 16, 2020}}</ref> It was also ranked 79th on [[Bravo (U.S. TV channel)|Bravo]]'s countdown of ''[[The 100 Scariest Movie Moments]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.listsofbests.com/list/2948-100-scariest-movie-moments?page=2|title=Parhaat Netticasinot ja esittelyt \u2013 Tutustu ja lunasta suosituimmat casinobonukset!|website=Parhaat Netticasinot ja esittelyt|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131104053809/http://www.listsofbests.com/list/2948-100-scariest-movie-moments?page=2|archive-date=November 4, 2013|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\nTo many film lovers and critics alike, Lugosi's portrayal is widely regarded as the definitive Dracula. Lugosi had a powerful presence and authority on-screen. The slow, deliberate pacing of his performance (\"I bid you\u2026 welcome!\" and \"I never drink\u2026 wine!\") gave his Dracula the air of a walking, talking corpse, which terrified the movie audiences at the time, compelling with no dialogue, and the many close-ups of Lugosi's face in icy silence jumped off the screen. With this mesmerizing performance, Dracula became Bela Lugosi's signature role, his Dracula a [[cultural icon]], and he himself a legend in the classic [[Universal Horror]] film series.\n\nHowever, Dracula would ultimately become a role which would prove to be both a blessing and a curse. Despite his earlier stage successes in a variety of roles, from the moment Lugosi donned the cape on screen, it would forever see him [[Typecasting (acting)|typecast]] as the Count.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Bela Lugosi in Person|last1=Kaffenberger|first1=William M., Jr. |last2=Rhodes|first2=Gary D.|last3=Croft|first3=Ann|date=May 25, 2015|publisher=BearManor Media|isbn=978-1-59393-805-5|location=Albany, GA|language=English}}</ref>\n\nBrowning would go on to direct Lugosi once more in another vampire thriller, ''[[Mark of the Vampire]]'', a 1935 remake of his lost silent film ''[[London After Midnight (film)|London After Midnight]]'' (1927).\n\nAlso, the film is recognized by [[American Film Institute]] in these lists:\n* 2001: [[AFI's 100 Years...100 Thrills]] \u2013 #85<ref>{{cite web|last= |first= |title=AFI's 100 Years...100 Thrills |url=http://www.afi.com/Docs/100Years/thrills100.pdf |publisher=[[American Film Institute]] |date= |access-date=August 20, 2016}}</ref>\n* 2003: [[AFI's 100 Years...100 Heroes & Villains]]:\n** [[Count Dracula]] \u2013 #33 Villain<ref>{{cite web|last= |first= |title=AFI's 100 Years...100 Heroes & Villains |url=http://www.afi.com/Docs/100Years/handv100.pdf |publisher=[[American Film Institute]] |date= |access-date=August 20, 2016}}</ref>\n* 2005: [[AFI's 100 Years...100 Movie Quotes]]:\n** Count Dracula: \"Listen to them.

Balderston|Balderston]], contributed much of Dracula's popular [[iconography]], much of which vastly differs from Stoker's novel. In the novel and in the German silent film ''[[Nosferatu]]'' (1922), Dracula's appearance is repulsive; Lugosi portrays the Count as a handsome, charming [[Nobility|nobleman]]. The Deane-Balderston play and this film also introduced the now iconic images of Dracula entering his victims' bedrooms through French doors/windows, wrapping his satin-lined cape around victims, and more emphasis on Dracula transforming into a bat. In the Stoker novel, he variously transformed into a bat or a wolf,<ref name=\"DVD\" /> [http://www.gutenberg.org/files/345/345-h/345-h.htm#CHAPTER_XVIII a mist or \"elemental dust.\"]\n\nThe now classic Dracula line, \"I never drink ... wine\", is original to this film. It did not appear in Stoker's novel or the original production of the play. When the play was revived on Broadway in 1977 starring [[Frank Langella]], the line was added to the script.<ref name=\"DVD\" />\n\n== Home media ==\nIn the 1990s, [[MCA/Universal Home Video]] released ''Dracula'' on [[VHS]] as part of the \"Universal Monsters Classic Collection\", a series of releases of [[Universal Classic Monsters]] films.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/6300181278/|title=Dracula (Universal Monsters Classic Collection) [VHS]|website=[[Amazon.com]]|access-date=January 16, 2020}}</ref> The film was also released on [[LaserDisc]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.lddb.com/laserdisc/43957/23001/Dracula:-The-Restored-Version|title=Dracula: The Restored Version|website=LaserDisc Database|access-date=January 19, 2020}}</ref>\n\nIn 1999, Universal released ''Dracula'' on VHS and [[DVD]] as part of the \"Classic Monster Collection\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/Dracula-VHS-Bela-Lugosi/dp/B00000JPHD/|title=Dracula (Classic Monster Collection) [VHS]|website=[[Amazon.com]]|access-date=January 16, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/Dracula-Universal-Studios-Classic-Collection/dp/B000035Z3K/|title=Dracula (Universal Studios Classic Monster Collection) [DVD]|website=[[Amazon.com]]|access-date=January 16, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.dvdtalk.com/reviews/1252/dracula-1931/|title=Dracula-1931|last=Arrington|first=Chuck|date=November 7, 2000|website=[[DVD Talk]]|access-date=January 16, 2020}}</ref> In 2004, Universal released ''Dracula: The Legacy Collection'' on DVD as part of the \"Universal Legacy Collection\".<ref name=amazon2004>{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/Dracula-Collection-Spanish-Draculas-Daughter/dp/B0001CNRLG/|title=Dracula -

It is based on the 1924 stage play ''[[Dracula (1924 play)|Dracula]]'' by [[Hamilton Deane]] and [[John L.

The film was partially shot on sets at [[Universal Studios Lot]] in California, which were reused at night for the filming of ''[[Dr\u00e1cula (film)|Dr\u00e1cula]]'', a concurrently produced Spanish-language version of the story also by Universal. \n\n''Dracula'' was a commercial and critical success upon release, and led to several [[sequel]]s and [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]]s. It has had a notable influence on popular culture, and Lugosi's portrayal of Dracula established the character as a [[cultural icon]], as well as the archetypal vampire in later works of fiction. In 2000, the film was selected by the United States [[Library of Congress]] for preservation in the [[National Film Registry]] as \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".\n\n== Plot ==\n[[Renfield]] ([[Dwight Frye]]) is a solicitor traveling to Count Dracula's ([[Bela Lugosi]]) castle in [[Transylvania]] on a business matter. The people in the local village fear that vampires inhabit the castle and warn Renfield not to go there. Renfield refuses to stay at the inn and asks his carriage driver to take him to the [[Borgo Pass]]. Renfield is driven to the castle by Dracula's coach, with Dracula disguised as the driver. En route, Renfield sticks his head out the window to ask the driver to slow down, but sees the driver has disappeared; a bat leads the horses.\n\nRenfield enters the castle welcomed by the charming but eccentric Count, who, unbeknownst to Renfield, is a [[vampire]]. They discuss Dracula's intention to lease Carfax [[Abbey]] in [[London]], where he intends to travel the next day. Dracula hypnotizes Renfield into opening a window. Renfield faints as a bat appears and Dracula's three wives close in on him. Dracula waves them away, then attacks Renfield himself.\n\nAboard the [[schooner]] ''Vesta'', Renfield is a raving lunatic slave to Dracula, who hides in a coffin and feeds on the ship's crew. When the ship reaches England, Renfield is discovered to be the only living person. Renfield is sent to [[John Seward|Dr. Seward]]'s [[sanatorium]] adjoining Carfax Abbey.\n\nAt a London theatre, Dracula meets Seward ([[Herbert Bunston]]). Seward introduces his daughter [[Mina Harker|Mina]] ([[Helen Chandler]]), her fianc\u00e9 [[Jonathan Harker|John Harker]] ([[David Manners]]) and the family friend [[Lucy Westenra|Lucy Weston]] ([[Frances Dade]]). Lucy is fascinated by Count Dracula. That night, Dracula enters her room and feasts on her blood while she sleeps. Lucy dies the next day after a string of transfusions.\n\nRenfield is obsessed with eating flies and spiders. [[Abraham Van Helsing|Professor Van Helsing]] ([[Edward Van Sloan]]) analyzes Renfield's blood and discovers his obsession. He starts talking about vampires, and that afternoon Renfield begs Seward to send him away, claiming his nightly cries may disturb Mina's dreams. When Dracula calls Renfield with wolf howling, Renfield is disturbed by Van Helsing showing him [[Aconitum|wolfsbane]], which Van Helsing says is used for protection from vampires.\n\nDracula visits Mina, asleep in her bedroom, and bites her. The next evening, Dracula enters for a visit and Van Helsing and Harker notice that he does not have a reflection. When Van Helsing reveals this to Dracula, he smashes the mirror and leaves. Van Helsing deduces that Dracula is the vampire behind the recent tragedies.\n\nMina leaves her room and runs to Dracula in the garden, where he attacks her. She is found by the maid. Newspapers report that a woman in white is luring children from the park and biting them. Mina recognizes the lady as Lucy, risen as a vampire. Harker wants to take Mina to London for safety, but is convinced to leave Mina with Van Helsing. Van Helsing orders Nurse Briggs ([[Joan Standing]]) to take care of Mina when she sleeps, and not to remove the wreath of wolfsbane from her neck.\n\nRenfield escapes from his cell and listens to the men discuss vampires. Before his attendant takes Renfield back to his cell, Renfield relates to them how Dracula convinced Renfield to allow him to enter the sanitorium by promising him thousands of rats with blood and life in them. Dracula enters the Seward parlour and talks with Van Helsing. Dracula states that Mina now belongs to him, and warns Van Helsing to return to [[Netherlands|his home country]]. Van Helsing swears to excavate Carfax Abbey and destroy Dracula. Dracula attempts to hypnotize Van Helsing, but the latter's resolve proves stronger. As Dracula lunges at Van Helsing, he withdraws a crucifix from his coat, forcing Dracula to retreat.\n\nHarker visits Mina on a terrace, and she speaks of how much she loves \"nights and fogs\". A bat flies above them and squeaks to Mina. She then attacks Harker but Van Helsing and Seward save him. Mina confesses what Dracula has done to her, and tells Harker their love is finished.\n\nDracula hypnotizes Briggs into removing the wolfsbane from Mina's neck and opening the windows. Van Helsing and Harker see Renfield heading for Carfax Abbey. They see Dracula with Mina in the abbey. When Harker shouts to Mina, Dracula thinks Renfield has led them there. Renfield pleads for his life, but Dracula kills him. Dracula is hunted by Van Helsing and Harker, who know that Dracula is forced to sleep in his coffin during daylight, and the sun is rising. Van Helsing prepares a wooden stake while Harker searches for Mina. Van Helsing impales Dracula through the heart, killing him, and Mina returns to normal.\n\n== Cast ==\n[[File:Bela Lugosi as Dracula, anonymous photograph from 1931, Universal Studios.jpg|right|thumb|upright|[[Bela Lugosi]] as Dracula]]\n{{Cast list |\n* [[Bela Lugosi]] as [[Count Dracula]]\n* [[Helen Chandler]] as [[Mina Harker|Mina Seward]]\n* [[David Manners]] as [[Jonathan Harker|John Harker]]\n* [[Dwight Frye]] as [[Renfield]]\n* [[Edward Van Sloan]] as [[Abraham Van Helsing|Van Helsing]]\n* [[Herbert Bunston]] as [[John Seward|Dr. Seward]]\n* [[Frances Dade]] as [[Lucy Westenra|Lucy Weston]]\n* [[Joan Standing]] as Nurse Briggs (in an error on the [[opening credits]], she is misidentified as \"Maid\")<ref name=\"DVD\" />\n* [[Charles K.

W. Murnau]]. Bram Stoker's widow sued for [[plagiarism]] and [[copyright infringement]], and the courts decided in her favor, essentially ordering that all [[release print|prints]] of ''Nosferatu'' be destroyed.<ref name=\"DVD\" /> Enthusiastic young Hollywood producer [[Carl Laemmle, Jr.]] also saw the box office potential in Stoker's gothic chiller, and he legally acquired the novel's film rights. Initially, he wanted ''Dracula'' to be a spectacle on a scale with the lavish silent films ''[[The Hunchback of Notre Dame (1923 film)|The Hunchback of Notre Dame]]'' (1923) and ''[[The Phantom of the Opera (1925 film)|The Phantom of the Opera]]'' (1925).\n\nAlready a huge hit on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]], the Deane/Balderston ''Dracula'' play would become the blueprint as the production gained momentum. The screenwriters carefully studied the silent, unauthorized version, [[F. W. Murnau]]'s ''[[Nosferatu]]'', for inspiration. Lifted directly from a nearly identical scene in ''Nosferatu'' that does not appear in Stoker's novel, was the early scene at the Count's castle when Renfield accidentally pricks his finger on a paper clip and it starts to bleed. Dracula creeps toward him with glee, only to be repelled when the crucifix falls in front of the bleeding finger.\n\n== Production ==\n[[File:Dracula1931BelaLugosiColor.png|thumb|Colorized still of [[Bela Lugosi]] as Dracula and [[Edward Van Sloan]] as Van Helsing]]\nDecision on casting the title role proved problematic. Initially, Laemmle was not at all interested in Lugosi, in spite of good reviews for his stage portrayal.

Dracula's transition from bat to person is always done off-camera. The film also employs extended periods of silence and character close-ups for dramatic effect, and employs two expository  [[intertitles]] and a closeup of a newspaper article to advance the story, a seeming holdover from [[silent film]]s;  a point made by online [[film critic]] [[James Berardinelli]]<ref>[http://preview.reelviews.net/movies/d/dracula31.html Review (2000)] by [[James Berardinelli]] at ReelViews.net</ref> is that the actors' performance style seems to belong to the silent era. Director [[Tod Browning]] had a solid reputation as a silent film director, having made them since 1915, but he never felt completely at ease with sound films.<ref name=\"DVD\" /> He only directed six more films over an eight-year period, the best known being the notorious ''[[Freaks (1932 film)|Freaks]]'', a horror movie with [[Olga Baclanova|Baclanova]] and a cast of actual carnival freaks that was yanked from distribution immediately. Browning directed his last film in 1939.\n\n== Music ==\nOwing to the costs of adding an original musical score to a film's soundtrack, no score had ever been composed specifically for the film.<ref name=ebert /> The music heard during the opening credits, an excerpt from Act II of [[Tchaikovsky]]'s ''[[Swan Lake]]'', was re-used in 1932 for another Universal horror film, ''[[The Mummy (1932 film)|The Mummy]]''. During the theatre scene where Dracula meets Dr. Seward, Harker, Mina, and Lucy, the end of the overture to [[Wagner]]'s ''[[Die Meistersinger von N\u00fcrnberg]]'' can also be heard as well as the dark opening of [[Symphony No. 8 (Schubert)|Schubert's \"Unfinished Symphony\" in B minor]].\n\n=== 1998 score ===\nIn 1998, composer [[Philip Glass]] was commissioned to compose a musical score for the classic film. The score was performed by the [[Kronos Quartet]]<ref name=ebert /> under the direction of Michael Reisman, Glass's usual conductor.\n\nOf the project, Glass said: \"The film is considered a classic. I felt the score needed to evoke the feeling of the world of the 19th century \u2014 for that reason I decided a string quartet would be the most evocative and effective. I wanted to stay away from the obvious effects associated with horror films. With [the Kronos Quartet] we were able to add depth to the emotional layers of the film.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1999-aug-26-ca-3726-story.html|title=Lugosi's 'Dracula' and 'Living Dead' Get a Jump on Halloween|last=King|first=Susan|date=August 26, 1999|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|access-date=January 19, 2020}}</ref>\n\nThe film, with this new score, was released by [[Universal Studios]] in 1999 in the [[VHS]] format.

In spite of the literary credentials of the source material, it was uncertain if an American audience was prepared for a serious full length supernatural chiller. Though American audiences had been exposed to other chillers before, such as ''[[The Cat and the Canary (1927 film)|The Cat and the Canary]]'' (1927), this was a horror story with no comic relief or trick ending that downplayed the supernatural. Despite this, ''Dracula'' proved to be a box office success.\n\nWhen the film finally premiered at the [[Roxy Theatre (New York City)|Roxy Theatre]] in New York City on February 12, 1931 (released two days later throughout the U.S.),<ref name=\"Sin42\" /> newspapers reported that members of the audiences fainted in shock at the horror on screen. This publicity, shrewdly orchestrated by the film studio, helped ensure people came to see the film, if for no other reason than curiosity. Within 48 hours of its opening at New York's Roxy Theatre, it had sold 50,000 tickets,<ref name=\"Sin42\" /> building a momentum that culminated in a $700,000 profit, the largest of Universal's 1931 releases.{{sfn|Vieira|2003|p=35}}\n\n=== Critical reception ===\nThe film was generally well received by critics upon its release.

Universal in particular would become the forefront of early horror cinema, with a canon of films including ''[[The Mummy (1932 film)|The Mummy]]'' (1932), ''[[The Invisible Man (1933 film)|The Invisible Man]]'' (1933), ''[[Bride of Frankenstein]]'' (1935), and ''[[The Wolf Man (1941 film)|The Wolf Man]]'' (1941).\n\nIn 1936, five years after release, Universal released ''[[Dracula's Daughter]]'', a direct [[sequel]] that starts immediately after the end of the first film. A second sequel, ''[[Son of Dracula (1943 film)|Son of Dracula]]'' starring [[Lon Chaney, Jr.]], followed in 1943. The Count returned to life in three more Universal films of the mid-1940s: 1944's ''[[House of Frankenstein (1944 film)|House of Frankenstein]]'', 1945's ''[[House of Dracula]]'' and 1948's comedy ''[[Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein]]''. Universal would only cast Lugosi as Dracula in one more film, the aforesaid [[Abbott and Costello]] vehicle,{{sfn|Fitzgerald|1977|p=60}} giving the role to [[John Carradine]] for the mid-1940s \"monster rally\" films, although Carradine admittedly more closely resembled Stoker's physical description from the book. Many of the familiar images of Dracula are from stills of the older Lugosi made during the filming of the 1948 comedy, so there remain two confusingly distinct incarnations of Lugosi as Dracula, seventeen years apart in age. As Lugosi played a vampire in three other movies during his career,{{efn|Lugosi played vampires in ''[[Mark of the Vampire]]'' (1935), ''[[The Return of the Vampire]]'' (1943) and ''[[Mother Riley Meets the Vampire]]'' (1952).{{sfn|Fitzgerald|1977|p=60}}}} this contributed to the public misconception that he portrayed Dracula on film many times.\n\nSince its release, ''Dracula'' has become widely regarded as a classic of the era and of its genre. In 2000, it was selected for preservation in the U.S. [[National Film Registry]] by the [[Library of Congress]] as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.loc.gov/programs/national-film-preservation-board/film-registry/complete-national-film-registry-listing/|title=Complete National Film Registry Listing|publisher=[[Library of Congress]]|access-date=January 16, 2020}}</ref> It was also ranked 79th on [[Bravo (U.S. TV channel)|Bravo]]'s countdown of ''[[The 100 Scariest Movie Moments]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.listsofbests.com/list/2948-100-scariest-movie-moments?page=2|title=Parhaat Netticasinot ja esittelyt \u2013 Tutustu ja lunasta suosituimmat casinobonukset!|website=Parhaat Netticasinot ja esittelyt|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131104053809/http://www.listsofbests.com/list/2948-100-scariest-movie-moments?page=2|archive-date=November 4, 2013|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\nTo many film lovers and critics alike, Lugosi's portrayal is widely regarded as the definitive Dracula. Lugosi had a powerful presence and authority on-screen. The slow, deliberate pacing of his performance (\"I bid you\u2026 welcome!\" and \"I never drink\u2026 wine!\") gave his Dracula the air of a walking, talking corpse, which terrified the movie audiences at the time, compelling with no dialogue, and the many close-ups of Lugosi's face in icy silence jumped off the screen. With this mesmerizing performance, Dracula became Bela Lugosi's signature role, his Dracula a [[cultural icon]], and he himself a legend in the classic [[Universal Horror]] film series.\n\nHowever, Dracula would ultimately become a role which would prove to be both a blessing and a curse.

Balderston|Balderston]], contributed much of Dracula's popular [[iconography]], much of which vastly differs from Stoker's novel. In the novel and in the German silent film ''[[Nosferatu]]'' (1922), Dracula's appearance is repulsive; Lugosi portrays the Count as a handsome, charming [[Nobility|nobleman]]. The Deane-Balderston play and this film also introduced the now iconic images of Dracula entering his victims' bedrooms through French doors/windows, wrapping his satin-lined cape around victims, and more emphasis on Dracula transforming into a bat. In the Stoker novel, he variously transformed into a bat or a wolf,<ref name=\"DVD\" /> [http://www.gutenberg.org/files/345/345-h/345-h.htm#CHAPTER_XVIII a mist or \"elemental dust.\"]\n\nThe now classic Dracula line, \"I never drink ... wine\", is original to this film. It did not appear in Stoker's novel or the original production of the play. When the play was revived on Broadway in 1977 starring [[Frank Langella]], the line was added to the script.<ref name=\"DVD\" />\n\n== Home media ==\nIn the 1990s, [[MCA/Universal Home Video]] released ''Dracula'' on [[VHS]] as part of the \"Universal Monsters Classic Collection\", a series of releases of [[Universal Classic Monsters]] films.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/6300181278/|title=Dracula (Universal Monsters Classic Collection) [VHS]|website=[[Amazon.com]]|access-date=January 16, 2020}}</ref> The film was also released on [[LaserDisc]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.lddb.com/laserdisc/43957/23001/Dracula:-The-Restored-Version|title=Dracula: The Restored Version|website=LaserDisc Database|access-date=January 19, 2020}}</ref>\n\nIn 1999, Universal released ''Dracula'' on VHS and [[DVD]] as part of the \"Classic Monster Collection\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/Dracula-VHS-Bela-Lugosi/dp/B00000JPHD/|title=Dracula (Classic Monster Collection) [VHS]|website=[[Amazon.com]]|access-date=January 16, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/Dracula-Universal-Studios-Classic-Collection/dp/B000035Z3K/|title=Dracula (Universal Studios Classic Monster Collection) [DVD]|website=[[Amazon.com]]|access-date=January 16, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.dvdtalk.com/reviews/1252/dracula-1931/|title=Dracula-1931|last=Arrington|first=Chuck|date=November 7, 2000|website=[[DVD Talk]]|access-date=January 16, 2020}}</ref> In 2004, Universal released ''Dracula: The Legacy Collection'' on DVD as part of the \"Universal Legacy Collection\".<ref name=amazon2004>{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/Dracula-Collection-Spanish-Draculas-Daughter/dp/B0001CNRLG/|title=Dracula -

It is a remake of the [[Telugu language|Telugu]] film ''[[Allari Mogudu]]'' (1992) and stars [[Rajinikanth]], [[Meena (actress)|Meena]] and [[Roja (actress)|Roja]] with [[Janagaraj]], [[Senthil]], [[Vadivukkarasi]], [[J. Livingston]], [[Mahesh Anand]], [[Vinu Chakravarthy]], [[Ajay Rathnam]], and [[Charuhasan]] in supporting roles. The film is about a man who  [[Bigamy|marries twice]] because of circumstances beyond his control and is forced to live a double life to cover his tracks.\n\nKrissna initially refused to remake ''Allari Mogudu'' because he disliked it but agreed after Rajinikanth told him their next film after ''[[Annaamalai]]'' (1992) should be different to avoid comparisons. The screenplay of ''Veera'' was written to be substantially different from the original; it was tailored to Rajinikanth's style and had logic added to the scenario, though Arunachalam, who made script changes, received sole screenwriting credit. The film was produced by his wife Meena, photographed by P. S. Prakash and edited by Ganesh\u2013Kumar.\n\n''Veera'' was released on 14 April 1994 during the [[Puthandu]] holiday. The film received mixed reviews from critics and audiences were disappointed because they expected a film like ''Annaamalai''. Audiences improved within a few weeks of its release and ''Veera'' became a commercial success, running for over 100 days in theatres.\n\n== Plot ==\n{{hatnote|The film follows a [[nonlinear narrative]]. The events are told in chronological order.}}\n\nMuthuveerappan (Muthu), a slacker from [[Karamadai]], falls in love with Devayani (Devi), the daughter of [[Carnatic music]]ian Krishnamurthy Shastri. To lure her, Muthu pretends to learn music from Shastri. One day, Devi overhears Muthu discussing his plans to seduce her with his friends and confronts him. Chastened, Muthu concentrates on his music and wins over Devi. They marry in secret but before they can make this official, Rathnavelu, son of the village landlord, tries to rape Devi. Muthu saves her by subduing Rathnavelu. Enraged, the landlord insults Muthu's mother, reminds her about a long-pending loan owed to him by Muthu's late father and threatens to evict her if the loan is not paid within a week. Muthu goes to [[Chennai|Madras]] to earn money.\n\nIn Madras, Muthu tries to enter a music competition to win the prize money. He meets [[tabla]] player Ravikanth, who gives him the stage name Veera. Both make repeated attempts to enter the competition but are unsuccessful. Muthu saves the competition promoter's owner Viswanathan's daughter Roopakala (Roopa) from Harichandran, a gangster. With Roopa's help, Muthu is able to perform at the competition with Ravikanth, and wins the prize money. Muthu returns to Karamadai and repays the loan, clearing his mother's debt. He learns Devi's house had been destroyed by a flood; the bodies of Devi and her father were not found. With Devi presumed dead, Muthu's mother tells him to return to Madras so that he can start afresh.\n\nAfter Muthu and his mother arrive in Madras, he gets a full-time job in the music industry as Veera. Roopa, having fallen in love with Muthu, wants to marry him. Muthu initially refuses because he misses Devi but his mother persuades him to marry her. After her marriage, Roopa goes to the United States after her father suffers a heart attack and has surgery there. Muthu finds Devi alive at the recording studio. She survived the flood but was left with [[amnesia]]; her memory was restored when she heard Muthu singing on the radio so she went to Madras in search for him. Muthu decides not to tell Devi about his marriage to Roopa.\n\nAfter Roopa and Viswanathan return, Muthu tries to tell Roopa about Devi but decides not to after she tells him about how her friend, at Roopa's suggestion, murdered her lover for infidelity. Devi and Muthu go to a temple to formally marry due to Devi's demands, and Ravikanth is tasked with preventing Roopa from going there but fails. Roopa arrives at the temple; Ravikanth helps Muthu to hide his marriage to Devi from Roopa and vice versa. When Roopa sees her husband leaving with Devi, Ravikanth lies that Muthu and Veera are different men. As a result, Muthu is forced to live a double life as Devi's husband Muthu and as Roopa's husband Veera.\n\nMuthu uses an [[Photo manipulation|altered photograph]] showing two of him, giving credence to his double life. Harichandran learns about this fraud, commits a murder and frames Muthu as Veera's killer. After Muthu reveals the truth about his double life to his wives, they fight over him and refuse to share him. The wives are kidnapped by Harichandran's men. Muthu subdues Harichandran, who is arrested. Muthu's wives reconcile with him but not with each other. Muthu's mother persuades him to leave Madras and return to Karamadai. When he, his mother and Ravikanth enter Muthu's house, they find Devi, Roopa and Viswanathan already there. Devi and Roopa take a bag each from Muthu then flounce off in opposite directions.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Rajinikanth]] as Muthuveerappan (Muthu)\n* [[Meena (actress)|Meena]] as Devayani (Devi)\n* [[Roja (actress)|Roja]] as Roopakala (Roopa)\n* [[Janagaraj]] as Viswanathan\n* [[Senthil]] as Ravikanth\n* [[Vadivukkarasi]] as Muthuveerappan's mother\n* [[J.

Rajinikanth said he wanted to make a \"two-wife\" comedy{{sfn|Ramachandran|2014|pp=153\u2013154}} but Krissna said ''Allari Mogudu'' lacks the values associated with typical Rajinikanth films and felt fans would not accept his character being bigamous. Rajinikanth said changes could be made to suit the local milieu.{{sfn|Krissna|Rangarajan|2012|pp=95\u201396}} Krissna wanted to begin work on ''[[Baashha]]'' but Rajinikanth said if their next film was similar to their action film ''[[Annaamalai]]'' (1992), \"we will get caught. Bring the hopes down, bring the level down and then take it up again.\" Krissna agreed but avoided making a [[shot-for-shot]] remake of ''Allari Mogudu''.{{sfn|Ramachandran|2014|pp=154\u2013155}}\n\nRajinikanth and Krissna went to the [[Banjara Hills|Taj Banjara]] hotel in [[Hyderabad]] to discuss the plot. They prepared a fresh outline in ten days; Krissna tailored the story to Rajinikanth's style and added logic to the scenario. He submitted the final draft to Arunachalam, who liked it and suggested plot changes.{{sfn|Krissna|Rangarajan|2012|pp=97\u201399}} According to Krissna, the remake has more \"emotional profundity\" than the Telugu original, and it was established that the protagonist Muthuveerappan (Muthu) is a pious person who married twice due to circumstances beyond his control. He differentiated Muthu from the original's protagonist, saying although circumstances drive him to another woman (Roopa), Muthu's feelings for his first wife Devi are sincere, he has not forgotten her, and is forced by his mother into marrying Roopa.{{sfn|Krissna|Rangarajan|2012|pp=100\u2013101}}\n\nThe symbolism in a scene in which Muthu removes a thread tied by Devi from his wrist to suggest their bond has ended was Arunachalam's idea.{{sfn|Krissna|Rangarajan|2012|p=101}} Whereas in ''Allari Mogudu'' the second love's desire for the protagonist is sexual, the sexual aspect in ''Veera'' is secondary. According to Krissna, \"we polished the screenplay over and over again till it gathered sheen. Eventually, but for the basic plot, ''Veera'' emerged as a near-new product.\"{{sfn|Krissna|Rangarajan|2012|p=101}} ''Veera'' was produced by Arunachalam's wife Meena under their banner P. A. Art Productions. Arunachalam received sole credit for the screenplay while P. Satyanand, the writer of ''Allari Mogudu'', received credit for the original story. Cinematography was handled by P. S.

Because the song that depicts Muthu performing on stage \"didn't lend itself to anything vibrant\", Krissna intercut it with scenes in which Roopa visualises Muthu in various outfits and begins to find him attractive. According to Krissna, this was a chance to show Muthu in a variety of costumes because he is only shown wearing a simple white shirt and black trousers until the song begins, and would not change his clothing and appearance until much later in the film. Krissna decided to \"let the audience get a glimpse of how [Muthu] would look later on in the film\" through this song.{{sfn|Krissna|Rangarajan|2012|pp=117\u2013118}}\n\n\"Malai Kovil Vaasalil\" was filmed at the MRF Racing Track in [[Thiruperumbudur]]. The song depicts Devi having formed Muthu's name (\u0bae\u0bc1\u0ba4\u0bcd\u0ba4\u0bc1) by arranging thousands of lamps, 20,000 lamps were made to glow simultaneously. Krissna decided to use chimney lamps that stopped the wind from extinguishing the lights. The song was to be filmed from above to emphasise the glowing lamps while Devi \"should appear as a mere spot in the middle of gigantic lamps\"; Prakash went to a tower that stood about {{Convert|200|feet|metres|abbr=out}} away from the actual spot so the camera could zoom in and out for best results. Krissna described it as \"one of the most strenuous and painstakingly shot sequences\" in his career.{{sfn|Krissna|Rangarajan|2012|pp=114\u2013116}} Rajinikanth and Anand did not rehearse the fight sequence in which Muthu and Harichandran jump towards each other then fall to the ground with their hands interlocked; they watched the stuntmen perform and followed their instructions. Rajinkanth performed all of his character's stunts without using a [[stunt double]].{{sfn|Krissna|Rangarajan|2012|p=129}}\n\nMagie's assistant Mani designed the large, multicoloured kolam that was {{Convert|100|x|200|feet|metres|abbr=on}}; a rope was attached to a pulley, one side of which was attached to Mani's waist. He was made to hang horizontally from it, with his face and hands turned towards the floor; completing the task took him two days and two nights.{{sfn|Krissna|Rangarajan|2012|pp=119\u2013120}} A scene in which Muthu and Ravikanth attempt to fool Roopa at a temple was filmed at Hyderabad's [[Birla Mandir]], which does not generally permit filming. Most of Rajinikanth's acting was improvised here. For the scene in which Muthuveerapan trips on his [[dhoti]] while changing into formal clothing, there were no retakes.{{sfn|Krissna|Rangarajan|2012|pp=126\u2013128}} While filming a scene in which Ravikanth talks to Chandran while Muthu silently witnesses, Rajinikanth could not control his laughter at Senthil's dialogue delivery and covered his mouth with a towel.{{sfn|Krissna|Rangarajan|2012|pp=124\u2013125}} In the post-production phase, Meena's voice was dubbed by K.

The screenplay of ''Veera'' was written to be substantially different from the original; it was tailored to Rajinikanth's style and had logic added to the scenario, though Arunachalam, who made script changes, received sole screenwriting credit. The film was produced by his wife Meena, photographed by P. S. Prakash and edited by Ganesh\u2013Kumar.\n\n''Veera'' was released on 14 April 1994 during the [[Puthandu]] holiday. The film received mixed reviews from critics and audiences were disappointed because they expected a film like ''Annaamalai''. Audiences improved within a few weeks of its release and ''Veera'' became a commercial success, running for over 100 days in theatres.\n\n== Plot ==\n{{hatnote|The film follows a [[nonlinear narrative]]. The events are told in chronological order.}}\n\nMuthuveerappan (Muthu), a slacker from [[Karamadai]], falls in love with Devayani (Devi), the daughter of [[Carnatic music]]ian Krishnamurthy Shastri. To lure her, Muthu pretends to learn music from Shastri. One day, Devi overhears Muthu discussing his plans to seduce her with his friends and confronts him. Chastened, Muthu concentrates on his music and wins over Devi. They marry in secret but before they can make this official, Rathnavelu, son of the village landlord, attempts to rape Devi. Muthu saves her by subduing Rathnavelu. Enraged, the landlord insults Muthu's mother, reminds her about a long-pending loan owed to him by Muthu's late father and threatens to evict her if the loan is not paid within a week. Muthu goes to [[Chennai|Madras]] to earn money.\n\nIn Madras, Muthu tries to enter a music competition to win the prize money. He meets [[tabla]] player Ravikanth, who gives him the stage name Veera. Both make repeated attempts to enter the competition but are unsuccessful. Muthu saves the competition promoter's owner Viswanathan's daughter Roopakala (Roopa) from Harichandran, a gangster. With Roopa's help, Muthu is able to perform at the competition with Ravikanth, and wins the prize money. Muthu returns to Karamadai and repays the loan, clearing his mother's debt. He learns Devi's house had been destroyed by a flood; the bodies of Devi and her father were not found. With Devi presumed dead, Muthu's mother tells him to return to Madras so that he can start afresh.\n\nAfter Muthu and his mother arrive in Madras, he gets a full-time job in the music industry as Veera. Roopa, having fallen in love with Muthu, wants to marry him. Muthu initially refuses because he misses Devi but his mother persuades him to marry her. After her marriage, Roopa goes to the United States after her father suffers a heart attack and has surgery there. Muthu finds Devi alive at the recording studio. She survived the flood but was left with [[amnesia]]; her memory was restored when she heard Muthu singing on the radio so she went to Madras in search for him. Muthu decides not to tell Devi about his marriage to Roopa.\n\nAfter Roopa and Viswanathan return, Muthu tries to tell Roopa about Devi but decides not to after she tells him about how her friend, at Roopa's suggestion, murdered her lover for infidelity. Devi and Muthu go to a temple to formally marry due to Devi's demands, and Ravikanth is tasked with preventing Roopa from going there but fails. Roopa arrives at the temple; Ravikanth helps Muthu to hide his marriage to Devi from Roopa and vice versa. When Roopa sees her husband leaving with Devi, Ravikanth lies that Muthu and Veera are different men. As a result, Muthu is forced to live a double life as Devi's husband Muthu and as Roopa's husband Veera.\n\nMuthu uses an [[Photo manipulation|altered photograph]] showing two of him, giving credence to his double life. Harichandran learns about this fraud, commits a murder and frames Muthu as Veera's killer. After Muthu reveals the truth about his double life to his wives, they fight over him and refuse to share him. The wives are kidnapped by Harichandran's men. Muthu subdues Harichandran, who is arrested. Muthu's wives reconcile with him but not with each other. Muthu's mother persuades him to leave Madras and return to Karamadai. When he, his mother and Ravikanth enter Muthu's house, they find Devi, Roopa and Viswanathan already there. Devi and Roopa take a bag each from Muthu then flounce off in opposite directions.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Rajinikanth]] as Muthuveerappan (Muthu)\n* [[Meena (actress)|Meena]] as Devayani (Devi)\n* [[Roja (actress)|Roja]] as Roopakala (Roopa)\n* [[Janagaraj]] as Viswanathan\n* [[Senthil]] as Ravikanth\n* [[Vadivukkarasi]] as Muthuveerappan's mother\n* [[J.

Rajinikanth said he wanted to make a \"two-wife\" comedy{{sfn|Ramachandran|2014|pp=153\u2013154}} but Krissna said ''Allari Mogudu'' lacks the values associated with typical Rajinikanth films and felt fans would not accept his character being bigamous. Rajinikanth said changes could be made to suit the local milieu.{{sfn|Krissna|Rangarajan|2012|pp=95\u201396}} Krissna wanted to begin work on ''[[Baashha]]'' but Rajinikanth said if their next film was similar to their action film ''[[Annaamalai]]'' (1992), \"we will get caught. Bring the hopes down, bring the level down and then take it up again.\" Krissna agreed but avoided making a [[shot-for-shot]] remake of ''Allari Mogudu''.{{sfn|Ramachandran|2014|pp=154\u2013155}}\n\nRajinikanth and Krissna went to the [[Banjara Hills|Taj Banjara]] hotel in [[Hyderabad]] to discuss the plot. They prepared a fresh outline in ten days; Krissna tailored the story to Rajinikanth's style and added logic to the scenario. He submitted the final draft to Arunachalam, who liked it and suggested plot changes.{{sfn|Krissna|Rangarajan|2012|pp=97\u201399}} According to Krissna, the remake has more \"emotional profundity\" than the Telugu original, and it was established that the protagonist Muthuveerappan (Muthu) is a pious person who married twice due to circumstances beyond his control. He differentiated Muthu from the original's protagonist, saying although circumstances drive him to another woman (Roopa), Muthu's feelings for his first wife Devi are sincere, he has not forgotten her, and is forced by his mother into marrying Roopa.{{sfn|Krissna|Rangarajan|2012|pp=100\u2013101}}\n\nThe symbolism in a scene in which Muthu removes a thread tied by Devi from his wrist to suggest their bond has ended was Arunachalam's idea.{{sfn|Krissna|Rangarajan|2012|p=101}} Whereas in ''Allari Mogudu'' the second love's desire for the protagonist is sexual, the sexual aspect in ''Veera'' is secondary. According to Krissna, \"we polished the screenplay over and over again till it gathered sheen. Eventually, but for the basic plot, ''Veera'' emerged as a near-new product.\"{{sfn|Krissna|Rangarajan|2012|p=101}} ''Veera'' was produced by Arunachalam's wife Meena under their banner P. A. Art Productions. Arunachalam received sole credit for the screenplay while P. Satyanand, the writer of ''Allari Mogudu'', received credit for the original story. Cinematography was handled by P. S.

Because the song that depicts Muthu performing on stage \"didn't lend itself to anything vibrant\", Krissna intercut it with scenes in which Roopa visualises Muthu in various outfits and begins to find him attractive. According to Krissna, this was a chance to show Muthu in a variety of costumes because he is only shown wearing a simple white shirt and black trousers until the song begins, and would not change his clothing and appearance until much later in the film. Krissna decided to \"let the audience get a glimpse of how [Muthu] would look later on in the film\" through this song.{{sfn|Krissna|Rangarajan|2012|pp=117\u2013118}}\n\n\"Malai Kovil Vaasalil\" was filmed at the MRF Racing Track in [[Thiruperumbudur]]. The song depicts Devi having formed Muthu's name (\u0bae\u0bc1\u0ba4\u0bcd\u0ba4\u0bc1) by arranging thousands of lamps, 20,000 lamps were made to glow simultaneously. Krissna decided to use chimney lamps that stopped the wind from extinguishing the lights. The song was to be filmed from above to emphasise the glowing lamps while Devi \"should appear as a mere spot in the middle of gigantic lamps\"; Prakash went to a tower that stood about {{Convert|200|feet|metres|abbr=out}} away from the actual spot so the camera could zoom in and out for best results. Krissna described it as \"one of the most strenuous and painstakingly shot sequences\" in his career.{{sfn|Krissna|Rangarajan|2012|pp=114\u2013116}} Rajinikanth and Anand did not rehearse the fight sequence in which Muthu and Harichandran jump towards each other then fall to the ground with their hands interlocked; they watched the stuntmen perform and followed their instructions. Rajinkanth performed all of his character's stunts without using a [[stunt double]].{{sfn|Krissna|Rangarajan|2012|p=129}}\n\nMagie's assistant Mani designed the large, multicoloured kolam that was {{Convert|100|x|200|feet|metres|abbr=on}}; a rope was attached to a pulley, one side of which was attached to Mani's waist. He was made to hang horizontally from it, with his face and hands turned towards the floor; completing the task took him two days and two nights.{{sfn|Krissna|Rangarajan|2012|pp=119\u2013120}} A scene in which Muthu and Ravikanth attempt to fool Roopa at a temple was filmed at Hyderabad's [[Birla Mandir]], which does not generally permit filming. Most of Rajinikanth's acting was improvised here. For the scene in which Muthuveerapan trips on his [[dhoti]] while changing into formal clothing, there were no retakes.{{sfn|Krissna|Rangarajan|2012|pp=126\u2013128}} While filming a scene in which Ravikanth talks to Chandran while Muthu silently witnesses, Rajinikanth could not control his laughter at Senthil's dialogue delivery and covered his mouth with a towel.{{sfn|Krissna|Rangarajan|2012|pp=124\u2013125}} In the post-production phase, Meena's voice was dubbed by K.

In 1930 the current elephant theme was introduced. It fell into disuse in the 1970s, but made its return in 1984. The elephant body forms the letters M-O-S-S, in reference to the company's foundation city. The object carried by the elephant is not a tree trunk, but a roll of paper fresh off the mill.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.peterson-emballasje.no/pages/page.asp?lngID=150&lngLangID=1 |title=Historikk|publisher=Peterson Emballasje|language=Norwegian|accessdate=18 January 2009}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n{{Use dmy dates|date=September 2010}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Peterson (Company)}}\n[[Category:Packaging companies of Norway]]\n[[Category:Companies established in 1801]]\n[[Category:1801 establishments in Norway]]\n[[Category:Shipping companies of Norway]]\n[[Category:Pulp and paper companies of Norway]]\n[[Category:Companies based in \u00d8stfold]]\n", "name_user": "Rich Farmbrough", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eReferences:Update date format tag and add authority control template", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peterson_(company)"}
