It was fought on 20 November 1759 between the [[Royal Navy]] and the [[French Navy]] in [[Quiberon Bay]], off the coast of [[France]] near [[St. Nazaire]]. The battle was the culmination of British efforts to eliminate French naval superiority, which could have given the French the ability to carry out their [[Planned French invasion of Britain (1759)|planned invasion of Great Britain]]. A [[Kingdom of Great Britain|British]] fleet of 24 [[ship of the line|ships of the line]] under [[Edward Hawke|Sir Edward Hawke]] tracked down and engaged a French fleet of 21 ships of the line under [[Hubert de Brienne, Comte de Conflans|Marshal de Conflans]]. After hard fighting, the British fleet sank or ran aground six French ships, captured one and scattered the rest, giving the Royal Navy one of its greatest victories, and ending the threat of French invasion for good.\n\nThe battle signalled the rise of the Royal Navy in becoming the world's foremost naval power, and, for the British, was part of the [[Annus Mirabilis of 1759]].\n\n==Background==\n{{further|Great Britain in the Seven Years' War|Planned French invasion of Britain (1759)|Battle of Lagos}}\n\nThe endemic ill feeling between France and Great Britain during the 18th century turned into open warfare in 1754 and 1755. In 1756 what become known as the [[Seven Years' War]] broke out across Europe, pitching France, Austria and Russia against Britain and Prussia. France supported Austria and Russia in a land campaign against Prussia, and launched what it saw as its main effort in a maritime and colonial offensive against Britain.{{sfn|Szabo|2007|pp=17\u201318}} By the beginning of 1759 neither alliance had the advantage, in either the land or sea campaigns, and both were having serious problems financing the war. In 1759 more than 60% of French revenue went to service its debt,{{sfn|McLynn|2005|p=65}} causing numerous shortages. The French navy in particular was overstretched{{sfn|Chaline|2011|p=17}} and suffered from the lack of a coherent doctrine, exacerbated by the inexperience verging on incompetence of the Secretary of State for the Navy, [[Nicolas Ren\u00e9 Berryer]], a former chief of police.{{sfn|Jenkins|1973|p=148}} Meanwhile, Britain's war effort up to early 1756 had been a failure.{{sfn|Anderson|2001|pp=211\u2013212}} From the summer of 1757 it came under the control of the assertive new [[secretary of state for the southern department]] (foreign minister), [[William Pitt, 1st Earl of Chatham|William Pitt]], who imposed a coordinated strategy. By early 1759 this was beginning to bear fruit.{{sfn|Chaline|2011|p=18}}\n\nIn response to the British successes, the ministers of the French king [[King Louis XV|Louis XV]] planned a direct invasion of Britain, which if successful would have decided the war in their favour.{{sfn|le Moing|2003|p=9}} An army of 17,000 was collected at Vannes, in the south-east of [[Brittany]], and nearly 100 transports were assembled near [[Quiberon Bay]],{{sfn|le Moing|2003|p=11}} plus several warships sailing ''[[en flute]]'', that is with their guns stripped out to allow them to transport more soldiers.{{sfn|la Condamine|2000|p=36}} In its final form the French plan required these transports to be escorted by the [[French Navy]].{{sfn|McLynn|2005|p=232}}\n\nHowever, at the best of times the French struggled to crew their full fleet with experienced mariners; landsmen could be used, but even a small deficiency in ship handling translated into a significant handicap in a combat situation. Three years into the war, thousands of French seamen were held as prisoners by the British; many more were engaged in speculative, and occasionally lucrative, [[privateer]]ing careers; and the unhealthy conditions, onerous onboard discipline and poor wages, paid late, acted as a strong disincentive to service. The transports also required at least a [[Cadre (military)|cadre]] of skilled men.{{sfn|McLynn|2005|p=232}} By the summer of 1759 the French had 73 [[ship of the line|ships of the line]], the largest warships of the time: 30 serving abroad and 43 in home waters. The ships in home waters required an aggregate [[Ship's company|complement]] of about 25,000 men; they were more than 9,000 short of this.{{sfn|McLynn|2005|pp=232\u2013233}} The 43 French ships in home waters were split between the Atlantic port of [[Brest, France|Brest]] (22 ships){{sfn|McLynn|2005|p=236}} and the Mediterranean port of [[Toulon]], with a small number at two ports on the [[Bay of Biscay]]: [[Lorient]] and [[Arsenal de Rochefort|Rochefort]]. The British had 40 ships of the line in home waters, and a further 15 in their Mediterranean Fleet, which was based in [[Gibraltar]].{{sfn|Tracey|2010|p=24}}\n\nBrest was the obvious starting point for the expedition: it was a major port; it was well placed with regard to the prevailing winds; and departure from it minimised the sailing distance and time to the proposed landing site.{{sfn|le Moing|2003|p=9}} However, Brest was at the end of a long and relatively infertile peninsula, which made supporting a large number of men there difficult; supplies of food had to come in by sea and were vulnerable to the British [[blockade]].{{sfn|Rodger|2004|p=279}} A [[typhoid]] epidemic in Brest during 1757\u20131758 killed over 4,000 French seamen, greatly exacerbating their shortage of experienced sailors.{{sfn|Rodger|2004|p=276}} In addition, there was fear of a recurrence of the typhus outbreak. Therefore, the army assembled at Vannes and its transports gathered around the [[Gulf of Morbihan]]; the terrain was more fertile, the anchorage was large and sheltered, and men and supplies could readily be despatched from Bordeaux, Rochefort, Nantes, or [[Orleans]].{{sfn|le Moing|2003|p=7}}\n\nIn August, the French Mediterranean Fleet under [[Jean-Fran\u00e7ois de La Clue-Sabran]] attempted to break out past Gibraltar into the Atlantic. The British Mediterranean Fleet under [[Edward Boscawen]] caught them and a [[Battle of Lagos|two-day battle]] resulted in three French ships of the line being captured, two destroyed, and five [[blockade]]d in [[Neutral country|neutral]] [[C\u00e1diz]]; two escaped the battle to reach Rochfort.{{sfn|Rodger|2004|pp=277\u2013278}}{{sfn|McLynn|2005|p=253}}{{sfn|Dull|2009|p=83}} The five French ships in Cadiz were blockaded by Boscawen's second-in-command, [[Thomas Brodrick (Royal Navy officer)|Thomas Brodrick]].{{sfn|McLynn|2005|p=253}} Five of Boscawen's victorious ships were transferred to Admiral [[Edward Hawke, 1st Baron Hawke|Edward Hawke]]'s fleet, off Brest.{{sfn|Willis|2009|p=763}}\n\n==Prelude==\n[[File:C\u00f4te Sud Morbihan - Baie de Quiberon.png|thumb|upright=|left|{{center|Map of Quiberon Bay}}]]\nDuring 1759, the British, under Hawke, maintained a close blockade on the French coast in the vicinity of Brest. In that year, the French [[Planned French Invasion of Britain (1759)|had made plans to invade England and Scotland]], and had accumulated transports and troops around the [[Loire River|Loire]] estuary. The defeat of the Mediterranean fleet at the [[Battle of Lagos (1759)|Battle of Lagos]] in August made the invasion plans impossible, but [[\u00c9tienne Fran\u00e7ois, duc de Choiseul|Choiseul]] still contemplated a plan for [[Scotland]], and so the fleet was ordered to escape the blockade and collect the transports assembled in the [[Gulf of Morbihan]].\n\nDuring the first week of November, a westerly [[gale]] came up and, after three days, the ships of Hawke's blockade were forced to run for [[Torbay]] on the south coast of England. [[Robert Duff (Royal Navy officer)|Robert Duff]] was left behind in Quiberon Bay, with a squadron of five 'fifties' (ships of the line with 50 cannons) and nine frigates to keep an eye on the transports.{{sfn|Corbett|1907|p=50}} In the meantime, a small squadron from the [[West Indies]] joined Conflans in Brest and, when an easterly wind came on the 14th, Conflans slipped out. He was sighted by {{HMS|Actaeon|1757|6}} which had remained on station off Brest despite the storms but which failed to rendezvous with Hawke, by {{HMS|Juno|1757|6}} & {{HMS|Swallow|1745|2}} which tried to warn Duff but were apparently chased off by the French, and by the victualler ''Love and Unity'' returning from Quiberon, which sighted the French fleet at 2pm on the 15th, 70 miles west of Belle-Isle.{{sfn|Corbett|1907|pp=52\u201353}} She met Hawke the next day and he sailed hard for Quiberon into a SSE gale. Meanwhile, {{HMS|Vengeance|1758|6}} had arrived in Quiberon Bay the night before to warn Duff and he had put his squadron to sea in the teeth of a WNW gale.{{sfn|Corbett|1907|p=59}}\n\n==Battle==\n[[File:Battle of Quiberon Bay - 1759 - Tracks map-en.svg|thumb|Upright=|left|{{center|Tracks of British and French fleets}}]]\nHaving struggled with unfavourable winds, Conflans had slowed down on the night of the 19th in order to arrive at Quiberon at dawn. 20 miles off Belleisle he sighted seven of Duff's squadron.{{sfn|Corbett|1907|p=59}} Once he realised that this was not the main British fleet, he gave chase. Duff split his ships to the north and south, with the French [[Vanguard (military tactics)|van]] and centre in pursuit, whilst the rearguard held off to windward to watch some strange sails appearing from the west.{{sfn|Corbett|1907|p=60}} The French broke off the pursuit but were still scattered as Hawke's fleet came into sight.{{sfn|Corbett|1907|p=60}} {{HMS|Magnanime|1748|6}} sighted the French at 8.30{{sfn|Corbett|1907|p=59}}  and Hawke gave the signal for line abreast.{{sfn|Corbett|1907|p=60}}\n\nConflans was faced with a choice, to fight in his current disadvantageous position in high seas and a \"very violent\" WNW wind, or take up a defensive position in Quiberon Bay and dare Hawke to come into the labyrinth of shoals and reefs.{{sfn|Corbett|1907|p=61}} About 9am Hawke gave the signal for general chase along with a new signal for the first 7 ships to form a line ahead and, in spite of the weather and the dangerous waters, set full sail.{{sfn|Corbett|1907|pp=63\u201364}} By 2.30 Conflans rounded Les Cardinaux, the rocks at the end of the Quiberon peninsula that give the battle its name in French. The first shots were heard as he did so, although Sir John Bentley in ''Warspite'' claimed that they were fired without his orders.{{sfn|Corbett|1907|p=65}} However the British were starting to overtake the rear of the French fleet even as their van and centre made it to the safety of the bay.\n\nJust before 4pm the battered ''[[French ship Formidable (1751)|Formidable]]'' surrendered to the {{HMS|Resolution|1758|2}}, just as Hawke himself rounded The Cardinals.{{sfn|Corbett|1907|p=66}} Meanwhile, ''Th\u00e9s\u00e9e'' lost her duel with [[HMS Neptune (1683)|HMS ''Torbay'']] and foundered, ''Superbe'' [[capsize]]d, and the badly damaged ''H\u00e9ros'' struck her flag to Viscount Howe{{sfn|Corbett|1907|p=66}} before running aground on the Four Shoal during the night.\n[[File:Bataille-Cardinaux.jpg|thumb|{{center|''Battle of Quiberon Bay: the Day After''}}<br />{{center|[[Richard Wright (painter)|Richard Wright]]' 1760}}]]\n\nMeanwhile, the wind shifted to the NW, further confusing Conflans' half-formed line as they tangled together in the face of Hawke's daring pursuit. Conflans tried unsuccessfully to resolve the muddle, but in the end decided to put to sea again. His flagship, ''[[French ship Soleil-Royal (1749)|Soleil Royal]]'', headed for the entrance to the bay just as Hawke was coming in on {{HMS|Royal George|1756|2}}. Hawke saw an opportunity to rake ''Soleil Royal'', but ''Intr\u00e9pide'' interposed herself and took the fire.{{sfn|Corbett|1907|p=67}} Meanwhile, ''Soleil Royal'' had fallen to leeward and was forced to run back and anchor off Croisic, away from the rest of the French fleet. By now it was about 5pm and darkness had fallen, so Hawke made the signal to anchor.{{sfn|Corbett|1907|p=67}}\n\nDuring the night eight French ships managed to do what ''Soleil Royal'' had failed to do, to navigate through the shoals to the safety of the open sea, and escape to [[Rochefort, Charente-Maritime|Rochefort]]. Seven ships and the frigates were in the Villaine estuary (just off the map above, to the east), but Hawke dared not attack them in the stormy weather.  The French jettisoned their guns and gear and used the rising tide and northwesterly wind to escape over the sandbar at the bottom of the Villaine river.{{sfn|Corbett|1907|p=68}} One of these ships was wrecked, and the remaining six were trapped throughout 1760 by a blockading British squadron and only later managed to break out and reach Brest in 1761/1762.{{sfn|Troude|1867|p=}} The badly damaged ''[[French ship Juste (1726)|Juste]]'' was lost as she made for the Loire, 150 of her crew surviving the ordeal, and {{HMS|Resolution|1758|2}} grounded on the Four Shoal during the night.\n\n''Soleil Royal'' tried to escape to the safety of the batteries at Croisic, but {{HMS|Essex|1679|2}} pursued her with the result that both were wrecked on the Four Shoal beside ''Heros''.  On the 22nd the gale moderated, and three of Duff's ships were sent to destroy the beached ships.  Conflans set fire to ''Soleil Royal'' while the British burnt ''Heros'',{{sfn|Corbett|1907|p=68}} as seen in the right of Richard Wright's painting. \n\n==Aftermath==\nThe British continued to keep a tight blockade on the French coast, which continued to starve French ports of commerce, further weakening France's economy.{{sfn|Corbett|1907|p=86}} Hawke attempted to destroy some of the French warships trapped in the Vilaine Estuary, sending in [[fire ship]]s; but these failed to accomplish the task.{{sfn|Corbett|1907|p=67}} Hawke developed a plan for landing on the coast, seizing a peninsula, and attacking the ships from land. However, he was forced to abandon this when orders reached him from Pitt for a different approach, which was ultimately unsuccessful.{{sfn|Corbett|1907|pp=93\u201394}}.\n\nThe power of the French fleet was broken, and would not recover before the war was over. Combined with admiral [[Edward Boscawen]]'s victory at the [[Battle of Lagos]] the previous August, the French invasion threat was removed.{{sfn|Anderson|2001|pp=381\u2013383}}  Although he had effectively put the French channel fleet out of action for the remainder of the war, Hawke was disappointed he had not secured a more comprehensive victory, asserting that had he had two more hours of daylight the whole enemy fleet would have been taken.{{sfn|Anderson|2001|p=383}} [[Edward Hawke, 1st Baron Hawke|Hawke]]'s commission was extended and followed by a [[Hereditary peer|peerage]] in 1776.\n\nThe Naval historian Nicholas Tracey described the battle as \"the most dramatic sea battle in the age of sail\",{{sfn|Tracey|2010|p=54}} while the naval theorist and historian [[Alfred Thayer Mahan|Alfred Mahan]] claimed that \"The battle of 20 November 1759 was the [[Battle of Trafalgar|Trafalgar]] of this war, and ... the English fleets were now free to act against the colonies of France, and later of Spain, on a grander scale than ever before.\"{{sfn|Mahan|1890|}} For instance, the French could not follow up their victory in the land [[battle of Sainte-Foy]] the following spring for want of reinforcements and supplies from France, and so Quiberon Bay may be regarded as the battle that determined the fate of [[New France]] and hence [[Canada]]. France experienced a [[credit crunch]] as financiers recognised that Britain could now strike at will against French trade. The French government was forced to default on its debt.{{sfn|Corbett|1907|p=72}} The battle was one of a series of British victories in 1759 which caused the year to be known as an [[Annus Mirabilis of 1759|''annus mirabilis'']] (Latin for \"year of wonders\").{{sfn|Monod|2009|p=167}}\n\n==Orders of battle==\n\n===France===\n[[File:Battle of Quiberon Bay IMG 4821.jpg|thumb|{{center|''Battle of

It was fought on 20 November 1759 between the [[Royal Navy]] and the [[French Navy]] in [[Quiberon Bay]], off the coast of [[France]] near [[St. Nazaire]]. The battle was the culmination of British efforts to eliminate French naval superiority, which could have given the French the ability to carry out their [[Planned French invasion of Britain (1759)|planned invasion of Great Britain]]. A [[Kingdom of Great Britain|British]] fleet of 24 [[ship of the line|ships of the line]] under [[Edward Hawke|Sir Edward Hawke]] tracked down and engaged a French fleet of 21 ships of the line under [[Hubert de Brienne, Comte de Conflans|Marshal de Conflans]]. After hard fighting, the British fleet sank or ran aground six French ships, captured one and scattered the rest, giving the Royal Navy one of its greatest victories, and ending the threat of French invasion for good.\n\nThe battle signalled the rise of the Royal Navy in becoming the world's foremost naval power, and, for the British, was part of the [[Annus Mirabilis of 1759]].\n\n==Background==\n{{further|Great Britain in the Seven Years' War|Planned French invasion of Britain (1759)|Battle of Lagos}}\n\nThe endemic ill feeling between France and Great Britain during the 18th century turned into open warfare in 1754 and 1755. In 1756 what become known as the [[Seven Years' War]] broke out across Europe, pitching France, Austria and Russia against Britain and Prussia. France supported Austria and Russia in a land campaign against Prussia, and launched what it saw as its main effort in a maritime and colonial offensive against Britain.{{sfn|Szabo|2007|pp=17\u201318}} By the beginning of 1759 neither alliance had the advantage, in either the land or sea campaigns, and both were having serious problems financing the war. In 1759 more than 60% of French revenue went to service its debt,{{sfn|McLynn|2005|p=65}} causing numerous shortages. The French navy in particular was overstretched{{sfn|Chaline|2011|p=17}} and suffered from the lack of a coherent doctrine, exacerbated by the inexperience verging on incompetence of the Secretary of State for the Navy, [[Nicolas Ren\u00e9 Berryer]], a former chief of police.{{sfn|Jenkins|1973|p=148}} Meanwhile, Britain's war effort up to early 1756 had been a failure.{{sfn|Anderson|2001|pp=211\u2013212}} From the summer of 1757 it came under the control of the assertive new [[secretary of state for the southern department]] (foreign minister), [[William Pitt, 1st Earl of Chatham|William Pitt]], who imposed a coordinated strategy. By early 1759 this was beginning to bear fruit.{{sfn|Chaline|2011|p=18}}\n\nIn response to the British successes, the ministers of the French king [[King Louis XV|Louis XV]] planned a direct invasion of Britain, which if successful would have decided the war in their favour.{{sfn|le Moing|2003|p=9}} An army of 17,000 was collected at Vannes, in the south-east of [[Brittany]], and nearly 100 transports were assembled near [[Quiberon Bay]],{{sfn|le Moing|2003|p=11}} plus several warships sailing ''[[en flute]]'', that is with their guns stripped out to allow them to transport more soldiers.{{sfn|la Condamine|2000|p=36}} In its final form the French plan required these transports to be escorted by the [[French Navy]].{{sfn|McLynn|2005|p=232}}\n\nHowever, at the best of times the French struggled to crew their full fleet with experienced mariners; landsmen could be used, but even a small deficiency in ship handling translated into a significant handicap in a combat situation. Three years into the war, thousands of French seamen were held as prisoners by the British; many more were engaged in speculative, and occasionally lucrative, [[privateer]]ing careers; and the unhealthy conditions, onerous onboard discipline and poor wages, paid late, acted as a strong disincentive to service. The transports also required at least a [[Cadre (military)|cadre]] of skilled men.{{sfn|McLynn|2005|p=232}} By the summer of 1759 the French had 73 [[ship of the line|ships of the line]], the largest warships of the time: 30 serving abroad and 43 in home waters. The ships in home waters required an aggregate [[Ship's company|complement]] of about 25,000 men; they were more than 9,000 short of this.{{sfn|McLynn|2005|pp=232\u2013233}} The 43 French ships in home waters were split between the Atlantic port of [[Brest, France|Brest]] (22 ships){{sfn|McLynn|2005|p=236}} and the Mediterranean port of [[Toulon]], with a small number at two ports on the [[Bay of Biscay]]: [[Lorient]] and [[Arsenal de Rochefort|Rochefort]]. The British had 40 ships of the line in home waters, and a further 15 in their Mediterranean Fleet, which was based in [[Gibraltar]].{{sfn|Tracey|2010|p=24}}\n\nBrest was the obvious starting point for the expedition: it was a major port; it was well placed with regard to the prevailing winds; and departure from it minimised the sailing distance and time to the proposed landing site.{{sfn|le Moing|2003|p=9}} However, Brest was at the end of a long and relatively infertile peninsula, which made supporting a large number of men there difficult; supplies of food had to come in by sea and were vulnerable to the British [[blockade]].{{sfn|Rodger|2004|p=279}} A [[typhoid]] epidemic in Brest during 1757\u20131758 killed over 4,000 French seamen, greatly exacerbating their shortage of experienced sailors.{{sfn|Rodger|2004|p=276}} In addition, there was fear of a recurrence of the typhus outbreak. Therefore, the army assembled at Vannes and its transports gathered around the [[Gulf of Morbihan]]; the terrain was more fertile, the anchorage was large and sheltered, and men and supplies could readily be despatched from Bordeaux, Rochefort, Nantes, or [[Orleans]].{{sfn|le Moing|2003|p=7}}\n\nIn August, the French Mediterranean Fleet under [[Jean-Fran\u00e7ois de La Clue-Sabran]] attempted to break out past Gibraltar into the Atlantic. The British Mediterranean Fleet under [[Edward Boscawen]] caught them and a [[Battle of Lagos|two-day battle]] resulted in three French ships of the line being captured, two destroyed, and five [[blockade]]d in [[Neutral country|neutral]] [[C\u00e1diz]]; two escaped the battle to reach Rochfort.{{sfn|Rodger|2004|pp=277\u2013278}}{{sfn|McLynn|2005|p=253}}{{sfn|Dull|2009|p=83}} The five French ships in Cadiz were blockaded by Boscawen's second-in-command, [[Thomas Brodrick (Royal Navy officer)|Thomas Brodrick]].{{sfn|McLynn|2005|p=253}} Five of Boscawen's victorious ships were transferred to Admiral [[Edward Hawke, 1st Baron Hawke|Edward Hawke]]'s fleet, off Brest.{{sfn|Willis|2009|p=763}}\n\n==Prelude==\n[[File:C\u00f4te Sud Morbihan - Baie de Quiberon.png|thumb|upright=|left|{{center|Map of Quiberon Bay}}]]\nDuring 1759, the British, under Hawke, maintained a close blockade on the French coast in the vicinity of Brest. In that year, the French [[Planned French Invasion of Britain (1759)|had made plans to invade England and Scotland]], and had accumulated transports and troops around the [[Loire River|Loire]] estuary. The defeat of the Mediterranean fleet at the [[Battle of Lagos (1759)|Battle of Lagos]] in August made the invasion plans impossible, but [[\u00c9tienne Fran\u00e7ois, duc de Choiseul|Choiseul]] still contemplated a plan for [[Scotland]], and so the fleet was ordered to escape the blockade and collect the transports assembled in the [[Gulf of Morbihan]].\n\nDuring the first week of November, a westerly [[gale]] came up and, after three days, the ships of Hawke's blockade were forced to run for [[Torbay]] on the south coast of England. [[Robert Duff (Royal Navy officer)|Robert Duff]] was left behind in Quiberon Bay, with a squadron of five 'fifties' (ships of the line with 50 cannons) and nine frigates to keep an eye on the transports.{{sfn|Corbett|1907|p=50}} In the meantime, a small squadron from the [[West Indies]] joined Conflans in Brest and, when an easterly wind came on the 14th, Conflans slipped out. He was sighted by {{HMS|Actaeon|1757|6}} which had remained on station off Brest despite the storms but which failed to rendezvous with Hawke, by {{HMS|Juno|1757|6}} & {{HMS|Swallow|1745|2}} which tried to warn Duff but were apparently chased off by the French, and by the victualler ''Love and Unity'' returning from Quiberon, which sighted the French fleet at 2pm on the 15th, 70 miles west of Belle-Isle.{{sfn|Corbett|1907|pp=52\u201353}} She met Hawke the next day and he sailed hard for Quiberon into a SSE gale. Meanwhile, {{HMS|Vengeance|1758|6}} had arrived in Quiberon Bay the night before to warn Duff and he had put his squadron to sea in the teeth of a WNW gale.{{sfn|Corbett|1907|p=59}}\n\n==Battle==\n[[File:Battle of Quiberon Bay - 1759 - Tracks map-en.svg|thumb|Upright=|left|{{center|Tracks of British and French fleets}}]]\nHaving struggled with unfavourable winds, Conflans had slowed down on the night of the 19th in order to arrive at Quiberon at dawn. 20 miles off Belleisle he sighted seven of Duff's squadron.{{sfn|Corbett|1907|p=59}} Once he realised that this was not the main British fleet, he gave chase. Duff split his ships to the north and south, with the French [[Vanguard (military tactics)|van]] and centre in pursuit, whilst the rearguard held off to windward to watch some strange sails appearing from the west.{{sfn|Corbett|1907|p=60}} The French broke off the pursuit but were still scattered as Hawke's fleet came into sight.{{sfn|Corbett|1907|p=60}} {{HMS|Magnanime|1748|6}} sighted the French at 8.30{{sfn|Corbett|1907|p=59}}  and Hawke gave the signal for line abreast.{{sfn|Corbett|1907|p=60}}\n\nConflans was faced with a choice, to fight in his current disadvantageous position in high seas and a \"very violent\" WNW wind, or take up a defensive position in Quiberon Bay and dare Hawke to come into the labyrinth of shoals and reefs.{{sfn|Corbett|1907|p=61}} About 9am Hawke gave the signal for general chase along with a new signal for the first 7 ships to form a line ahead and, in spite of the weather and the dangerous waters, set full sail.{{sfn|Corbett|1907|pp=63\u201364}} By 2.30 Conflans rounded Les Cardinaux, the rocks at the end of the Quiberon peninsula that give the battle its name in French. The first shots were heard as he did so, although Sir John Bentley in ''Warspite'' claimed that they were fired without his orders.{{sfn|Corbett|1907|p=65}} However the British were starting to overtake the rear of the French fleet even as their van and centre made it to the safety of the bay.\n\nJust before 4pm the battered ''[[French ship Formidable (1751)|Formidable]]'' surrendered to the {{HMS|Resolution|1758|2}}, just as Hawke himself rounded The Cardinals.{{sfn|Corbett|1907|p=66}} Meanwhile, ''Th\u00e9s\u00e9e'' lost her duel with [[HMS Neptune (1683)|HMS ''Torbay'']] and foundered, ''Superbe'' [[capsize]]d, and the badly damaged ''H\u00e9ros'' struck her flag to Viscount Howe{{sfn|Corbett|1907|p=66}} before running aground on the Four Shoal during the night.\n[[File:Bataille-Cardinaux.jpg|thumb|{{center|''Battle of Quiberon Bay: the Day After''}}<br />{{center|[[Richard Wright (painter)|Richard Wright]]' 1760}}]]\n\nMeanwhile, the wind shifted to the NW, further confusing Conflans' half-formed line as they tangled together in the face of Hawke's daring pursuit. Conflans tried unsuccessfully to resolve the muddle, but in the end decided to put to sea again. His flagship, ''[[French ship Soleil-Royal (1749)|Soleil Royal]]'', headed for the entrance to the bay just as Hawke was coming in on {{HMS|Royal George|1756|2}}. Hawke saw an opportunity to rake ''Soleil Royal'', but ''Intr\u00e9pide'' interposed herself and took the fire.{{sfn|Corbett|1907|p=67}} Meanwhile, ''Soleil Royal'' had fallen to leeward and was forced to run back and anchor off Croisic, away from the rest of the French fleet. By now it was about 5pm and darkness had fallen, so Hawke made the signal to anchor.{{sfn|Corbett|1907|p=67}}\n\nDuring the night eight French ships managed to do what ''Soleil Royal'' had failed to do, to navigate through the shoals to the safety of the open sea, and escape to [[Rochefort, Charente-Maritime|Rochefort]]. Seven ships and the frigates were in the Villaine estuary (just off the map above, to the east), but Hawke dared not attack them in the stormy weather.  The French jettisoned their guns and gear and used the rising tide and northwesterly wind to escape over the sandbar at the bottom of the Villaine river.{{sfn|Corbett|1907|p=68}} One of these ships was wrecked, and the remaining six were trapped throughout 1760 by a blockading British squadron and only later managed to break out and reach Brest in 1761/1762.{{sfn|Troude|1867|p=}} The badly damaged ''[[French ship Juste (1726)|Juste]]'' was lost as she made for the Loire, 150 of her crew surviving the ordeal, and {{HMS|Resolution|1758|2}} grounded on the Four Shoal during the night.\n\n''Soleil Royal'' tried to escape to the safety of the batteries at Croisic, but {{HMS|Essex|1679|2}} pursued her with the result that both were wrecked on the Four Shoal beside ''Heros''.  On the 22nd the gale moderated, and three of Duff's ships were sent to destroy the beached ships.  Conflans set fire to ''Soleil Royal'' while the British burnt ''Heros'',{{sfn|Corbett|1907|p=68}} as seen in the right of Richard Wright's painting. \n\n==Aftermath==\nThe British continued to keep a tight blockade on the French coast, which continued to starve French ports of commerce, further weakening France's economy.{{sfn|Corbett|1907|p=86}} Hawke attempted to destroy some of the French warships trapped in the Vilaine Estuary, sending in [[fire ship]]s; but these failed to accomplish the task.{{sfn|Corbett|1907|p=67}} Hawke developed a plan for landing on the coast, seizing a peninsula, and attacking the ships from land. However, he was forced to abandon this when orders reached him from Pitt for a different approach, which was ultimately unsuccessful.{{sfn|Corbett|1907|pp=93\u201394}}.\n\nThe power of the French fleet was broken, and would not recover before the war was over. Combined with admiral [[Edward Boscawen]]'s victory at the [[Battle of Lagos]] the previous August, the French invasion threat was removed.{{sfn|Anderson|2001|pp=381\u2013383}}  Although he had effectively put the French channel fleet out of action for the remainder of the war, Hawke was disappointed he had not secured a more comprehensive victory, asserting that had he had two more hours of daylight the whole enemy fleet would have been taken.{{sfn|Anderson|2001|p=383}} [[Edward Hawke, 1st Baron Hawke|Hawke]]'s commission was extended and followed by a [[Hereditary peer|peerage]] in 1776.\n\nThe Naval historian Nicholas Tracey described the battle as \"the most dramatic sea battle in the age of sail\",{{sfn|Tracey|2010|p=54}} while the naval theorist and historian [[Alfred Thayer Mahan|Alfred Mahan]] claimed that \"The battle of 20 November 1759 was the [[Battle of Trafalgar|Trafalgar]] of this war, and ... the English fleets were now free to act against the colonies of France, and later of Spain, on a grander scale than ever before.\"{{sfn|Mahan|1890|}} For instance, the French could not follow up their victory in the land [[battle of Sainte-Foy]] the following spring for want of reinforcements and supplies from France, and so Quiberon Bay may be regarded as the battle that determined the fate of [[New France]] and hence [[Canada]]. France experienced a [[credit crunch]] as financiers recognised that Britain could now strike at will against French trade. The French government was forced to default on its debt.{{sfn|Corbett|1907|p=72}} The battle was one of a series of British victories in 1759 which caused the year to be known as an [[Annus Mirabilis of 1759|''annus mirabilis'']] (Latin for \"year of wonders\").{{sfn|Monod|2009|p=167}}\n\n==Orders of battle==\n\n===France===\n[[File:Battle of Quiberon Bay IMG 4821.jpg|thumb|{{center|''Battle of

The job of the peltast was not to engage in formation combat, therefore, many carried nothing more than javelins.\n\n===Ranged weapons===\nHand-to-hand, light support troops such as the ''psiloi'' were often armed with ranged weapons. Popular ranged weapons were the bow (''[[Toxotai|toxa]]''), javelin (''[[javelin|akontia]]'') and sling (''[[Sling (weapon)|sfendonai]]''). While the bow was a relatively uncommon weapon (the wooden stave bow used had a limited range), some troops treated their arrows by thrusting them into rotting corpses, thus creating a crude form of biological weapon.<ref name=\"Broyles2004\">{{cite book|author=Janell Broyles|title=Chemical And Biological Weapons In A Post-9/11 World|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7t_AWHY5fLkC&pg=PA9|accessdate=7 June 2012|date=1 November 2004|publisher=The Rosen Publishing Group|isbn=978-1-4042-0288-7|pages=9}}</ref> Peltast troops commonly used javelins, and hoplites and cavalry troops were also often equipped with javelins for throwing.

Bronze breastplate armor was also used, in forms such as a [[Cuirass|bell cuirass]]. Little other armor was worn, and fatal blows to unprotected areas (such as the bladder or neck) are recorded in ancient art and poetry.<ref name=\"SacksMurray1997\"/> Cavalry armor was designed to be lightweight; over a sleeveless tunic called a ''chitoniskos'' the cavalry soldier would wear a [[muscle cuirass]] designed to leave the arms as free as possible.<ref name=\"SekundaSekunda1986\">{{cite book|author1=Nick Sekunda|author2=Nicholas Sekunda|title=The Ancient Greeks|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=93-ZFvr-lkoC&pg=PA18|accessdate=29 May 2012|date=22 May 1986|publisher=Osprey Publishing|isbn=978-0-85045-686-8|pages=18}}</ref> Hoplites wore [[greave]]s to protect the lower leg, as did cavalry, but otherwise the torso and head were the only body parts protected by armor.\n\n==Shields==\nThe most vital part of the panoply was the [[Aspis]], a large, round shield commonly made from a layer of bronze, wood, and leather.

The earliest standard hoplite helmet was the [[Corinthian helmet]], developed around 600BC.<ref name=\"SacksMurray1997\"/> Later, this was replaced by the [[Phrygian type helmet|Phrygian helmet]] and [[Chalcidian helmet]], which were lighter and did not impair the wearer's vision or hearing so severely. Helmets often had a horsehair crest, for decorative purposes and as an additional level of protection. The [[Boeotian helmet]] was commonly used by cavalry troops due to their need for unimpeded vision and hearing. Helmets were mainly used for protecting the head but leaving the eyes, mouth and nose unprotected.<ref name=\"Heckel2002\">{{cite book|author=Waldemar Heckel|title=The Wars of Alexander the Great: 336-323 BC|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=p3D_QHiHdpAC&pg=PA25|accessdate=30 May 2012|date=25 July 2002|publisher=Osprey Publishing|isbn=978-1-84176-473-3|pages=25}}</ref>\n\n==Other==\n\n===Chariots===\nThe [[Chariot#Greece|chariot]], though ineffective for warfare in the hilly terrain of the Greek mainland, was used by the [[Mycenean Greek|Myceneans]] in some circumstances.

Popular ranged weapons were the bow (''[[Toxotai|toxa]]''), javelin (''[[javelin|akontia]]'') and sling (''[[Sling (weapon)|sfendonai]]'').

There are a number of sub-disciplines with non-invasive techniques for studying the neurological workings of the brain; for example, [[neurolinguistics]] has become a field in its own right. Initial forays into psycholinguistics were found in philosophical and educational fields, due mainly to their location in departments other than applied sciences (e.g., cohesive data on how the human brain functioned).\n\nPsycholinguistics is concerned with the cognitive faculties and processes that are necessary in order for grammatical forms of language to be produced from a mental [[grammar]] and the [[lexicon]]. It is also concerned with the perception of these constructions by a listener. [[Developmental psycholinguistics]], as a branch of psycholinguistics, concerns itself with the child's ability to learn language.\n\n==Areas of study==\nPsycholinguistics is an interdisciplinary field. Hence, it is studied by researchers from a variety of different backgrounds, such as psychology, [[cognitive science]], linguistics, [[speech and language pathology]], and [[discourse analysis]]. Psycholinguists study many different topics, but these topics can generally be divided into answering the following questions: (1) how do children acquire language ([[language acquisition]])?; (2) how do people comprehend language (language comprehension)?; (3) how do people produce language (language production)?; and (4) how do people who already know one language acquire another one([[second language acquisition]])?\n\nSubdivisions in psycholinguistics are also made based on the different components that make up human [[language]].\n\nLinguistics-related areas:\n* [[Phonetics]] and [[phonology]] are concerned with the study of speech sounds. Within psycholinguistics, research focuses on how the brain processes and understands these sounds.\n* [[Morphology (linguistics)|Morphology]] is the study of word structures, especially the relationships between related words (such as ''dog'' and ''dogs'') and the formation of words based on rules (such as plural formation).\n* [[Syntax]] is the study of the patterns which dictate how words are combined to form sentences.\n* [[Semantics]] deals with the [[meaning (linguistic)|meaning]] of words and sentences. Where syntax is concerned with the formal structure of sentences, semantics deals with the actual meaning of sentences.\n* [[Pragmatics]] is concerned with the role of [[context (language use)|context]] in the interpretation of meaning.\n\nA researcher interested in language comprehension may study [[word]] recognition during [[reading (activity)|reading]] to examine the processes involved in the extraction of [[orthography|orthographic]], [[morphology (linguistics)|morphological]], [[phonological]], and [[semantic]] information from patterns in printed text. A researcher interested in language production might study how words are prepared to be spoken starting from the conceptual or semantic level (this concerns connotation, and possibly can be examined through the conceptual framework concerned with the [[semantic differential]]). Developmental psycholinguists study infants' and children's ability to learn and process language.<ref>{{cite journal| vauthors = Houston DM, Jusczyk PW |title=The Role of Talker-Specific Information in Word Segmentation by Infants|journal=Journal of Experimental Psychology: Human Perception and Performance|year=2000|volume=26|issue=5|pages=1570\u20131582|doi=10.1037/0096-1523.26.5.1570|url=http://www.iupui.edu/~babytalk/pdfs/Houston_2011.pdf|access-date=1 March 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131005004725/http://www.iupui.edu/~babytalk/pdfs/Houston_2011.pdf|archive-date=5 October 2013}}</ref>\n\n==History of psycholinguistics==\n\n=== Language acquisition and innateness ===\nPsycholinguistics, in seeking to understand the properties of language acquisition has roots in debates regarding innate vs acquired behaviors (both in biology and psychology).

However, with the redefining of innateness as time progressed, behaviors considered innate could once again be analyzed as behaviors that interacted with the psychological aspect of an individual.

The first theory states that all language must be learned by the child.  The second view states that the abstract system of language cannot be learned, but that humans possess an innate language faculty, or an access to what has been called [[universal grammar]]. The view that language must be learned was especially popular before 1960 and is well represented by the [[Mentalism (psychology)|mentalistic]] theories of [[Jean Piaget]] and the empiricist [[Rudolf Carnap]]. Likewise, the school of psychology known as [[behaviorism]] (see [[Verbal Behavior]] (1957) by [[B.F. Skinner]]) puts forth the point of view that language is a behavior shaped by conditioned response, hence it is learned.\n\nThe innatist perspective began with [[Noam Chomsky]]'s highly critical review of Skinner's book in 1959.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Chomsky N, Skinner BF |year=1959 |title=A Review of B. F. Skinner's Verbal Behavior |journal=Language |issn=0097-8507 |volume=35 |issue=1 |pages=26\u201358 |doi=10.2307/411334  |jstor=411334}}</ref> This review helped to start what has been termed \"the [[cognitive revolution]]\" in psychology.  Chomsky posited humans possess a special, innate ability for language and that complex syntactic features, such as [[recursion]], are \"hard-wired\" in the brain. These abilities are thought to be beyond the grasp of the most intelligent and social non-humans. According to Chomsky, children acquiring a language have a vast search space to explore among all possible human grammars, yet at the time there was no evidence that children receive sufficient input to learn all the rules of their language (see [[poverty of the stimulus]]). Hence, there must be some other innate mechanism that endows a language ability to humans. Such a language faculty is, according to the [[innateness hypothesis]], what defines human language and makes it different from even the most sophisticated forms of animal communication.\n\nThe field of linguistics and psycholinguistics since then has been defined by reactions to Chomsky, pro and con. The pro view still holds that the human ability to use language (specifically the ability to use recursion) is qualitatively different from any sort of animal ability.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Hauser MD, Chomsky N, Fitch WT | title = The faculty of language: what is it, who has it, and how did it evolve? | journal = Science | volume = 298 | issue = 5598 | pages = 1569\u201379 | date = November 2002 | pmid = 12446899 | doi = 10.1126/science.298.5598.1569 }}</ref> This ability may {{Citation needed|date=May 2018}} have resulted from a favorable mutation or from an adaptation of skills evolved for other purposes. The view that language can be learned has had a recent resurgence inspired by [[emergentism]]. This view challenges the \"innate\" view as scientifically unfalsifiable; that is to say, it can't be tested. With the amount of computer power increasing since the 1980s, researchers have been able to simulate language acquisition using neural network models.<ref>{{cite book | title=Rethinking innateness: A connectionist perspective on development | last=Elman |first=Jeffrey | last2 = Bates | first2 = Elizabeth | last3 = Johnson | first3 = Mark | last4 = Karmiloff-Smith | first4 = Annette | last5 = Parisi | first5 = Domenico | last6 = Plunkett | first6 = Kim | name-list-format = vanc | year=1998 | publisher=The MIT Press}}</ref> These models provide evidence that there may, in fact, be sufficient information contained in the input to learn language, even syntax. If this is true, then an innate mechanism is no longer necessary to explain language acquisition.\n\n===Language comprehension===\n{{Main|Language comprehension}}\n\nThe structures and uses of language are related to the formation of ontological insights.<ref>{{Cite journal |jstor = 1400116|title = The Structure of the Chinese Language and Ontological Insights: A Collective-Noun Hypothesis|journal = Philosophy East and West|volume = 49|issue = 1|pages = 45\u201362|last1 = Mou|first1 = Bo | name-list-format = vanc |year = 1999|doi = 10.2307/1400116}}</ref> Some see this system as \"structured cooperation between language-users\" using \"conceptual difference\"\"[[semantic deference]]\" in order to exchange meaning and knowledge and give meaning to language, examining and describing \"semantic processes bound by a \u2018stopping\u2019 constraint which are not cases of ordinary deferring. Deferring is normally done for a reason, and a rational person is always disposed to defer if there is good reason.<ref>{{Cite journal |doi = 10.1111/1468-0017.00143|title = Reference and Deference|journal = Mind and Language|volume = 15|issue = 4|pages = 433\u2013451|year = 2000|last1 = Woodfield|first1 = Andrew | name-list-format = vanc }}</ref>\n\nThe theory of the [[Semantic differential]] supposes universal distinctions such as factors of \"Typicality\" (that included scales such as \"regular-rare\", \"typical-exclusive\"), \"Reality\" (\"imaginary-real\", \"evident-fantastic\", \"abstract-concrete\"), as well as factors of \"Complexity\" (\"complex-simple\", \"unlimited-limited\", \"mysterious-usual\"), \"Improvement\" or \"Organization\" (\"regular-spasmodic\", \"constant-changeable\", \"organized-disorganized\", \"precise-indefinite\"), Stimulation (\"interesting-boring\", \"trivial-new\"), calling it \" in the measurement of attitudes.<ref>Himmelfarb (1993) p 57</ref>\"\n\n==Reading==\nOne question in the realm of language comprehension is how people understand sentences as they read (also known as [[sentence processing]]). Experimental research has spawned a number of theories about the architecture and mechanisms of sentence comprehension. Typically these theories are concerned with what types of information contained in the sentence the reader can use to build meaning, and at what point in reading does that information become available to the reader. Issues such as \"[[modularity of mind|modular]]\" versus \"interactive\" processing have been theoretical divides in the field.\n\nA modular view of sentence processing assumes that the stages involved in reading a sentence function independently in separate modules. These modules have limited interaction with one another. For example, one influential theory of sentence processing, the garden-path theory,<ref>{{cite journal | title=Making and correcting errors during sentence comprehension: Eye movements in the analysis of structurally ambiguous sentences | vauthors = Frazier L, Rayner K | journal=Cognitive Psychology | volume=14 | issue=2 | pages=178\u2013210 | year=1982 | doi=10.1016/0010-0285(82)90008-1}}</ref> states that syntactic analysis takes place first. Under this theory as the reader is reading a sentence, he or she creates the simplest structure possible in order to minimize effort and cognitive load. This is done without any input from semantic analysis or context-dependent information. Hence, in the sentence \"The evidence examined by the lawyer turned out to be unreliable,\" by the time the reader gets to the word \"examined\" he or she has committed to a reading of the sentence in which the evidence is examining something because it is the simplest parse. This commitment is made despite the fact that it results in an implausible situation; we know from experience that evidence can rarely if ever examine something. Under this \"syntax first\" theory, semantic information is processed at a later stage. It is only later that the reader will recognize that he or she needs to revise the initial parse into one in which \"the evidence\" is being examined. In this example, readers typically recognize their misparse by the time they reach \"by the lawyer\" and must go back and re-parse the sentence.<ref>{{cite journal | title=The interaction of syntax and semantics during sentence processing: Eye movements in the analysis of semantically biased sentences | vauthors = Rayner K, Carlson M, Frazier L | journal=Journal of Verbal Learning and Verbal Behavior | volume=22 |issue=3 | pages=358\u2013374 | year=1983 | doi=10.1016/s0022-5371(83)90236-0}}</ref> This reanalysis is costly and contributes to slower reading times.\n\nIn contrast to a modular account, an interactive theory of sentence processing, such as a [[Constraint-based grammar|constraint-based]] lexical approach<ref>{{cite journal | title=Toward a lexical framework of constraint-based syntactic ambiguity resolution | vauthors = Trueswell J, Tanenhaus M | journal=Perspectives on Sentence Processing | pages=155\u2013179 | year=1994}}</ref> assumes that all available information contained within a sentence can be processed at any time. Under an interactive account, for example, the semantics of a sentence (such as plausibility) can come into play early on in order to help determine the structure of a sentence. Hence, in the sentence above, the reader would be able to make use of plausibility information in order to assume that \"the evidence\" is being examined instead of doing the examining. There are data to support both modular and interactive accounts; which account is the correct one is still up for debate.\n\nWhen reading, saccades can cause the mind to skip over words because it doesn\u2019t see them as important to the sentence, and the mind completely leaves it from the sentence or it replaces it with the wrong word. This can be seen in \u2018Paris in the{{nbsp}}the Spring\u2019. This is a common psychological test, where the mind will often skip the second \u2018the\u2019, especially when there is a line break in between the two.<ref> Drieghe, D., Rayner, K., & Pollatsek, A. (2005). Eye movements and word skipping during reading revisited. Journal of Experimental Psychology: Human Perception and Performance, 31(5), 954. </ref>\t\n\n===Language production===\n{{Main|Language production}}\nLanguage production concerns how people produce language, either in written or spoken form, in a way that conveys meanings comprehensible to others. One of the most effective ways to explain the way people represent meanings using rule-governed languages is by observing and analyzing instances of [[speech errors]]. They include speech dysfluencies like false starts, repetition, reformulation and constant pauses in between words or sentences; also, slips of tongue, like blendings, substitutions, exchanges (e.g. [[Spoonerism]]), and various pronunciation errors. These speech errors yield significant implication on language production, in that they reflect that:<ref>{{Cite journal | vauthors = Fromkin V |date=1973|title=Speech errors as linguistic evidence|journal=|volume=|pages=|hdl=11858/00-001M-0000-002B-2D04-D}}</ref>\n# Speech is planned in advance: speech errors like substitution and exchanges show that one does not plan his/her entire sentence before s/he speaks. Rather, their language faculty is constantly tapped during the speech production process. This is accounted for by the limitation of the working memory. In particular, errors involving exchanges imply that one plans ahead in their sentence but only about significant ideas (e.g. the words that constitute the core meaning) and only to a certain extent of the sentence.\n# Lexicon is organized semantically and phonologically: substitution and pronunciation errors show that lexicon is organized not only by its meaning, but also its form.\n# Morphologically complex words are assembled: errors involving blending within a word reflect that there seems to be a rule governing the construction of words in production (and also likely in mental lexicon). In other words, speakers generate the morphologically complex words by merging morphemes rather than retrieving them as chunks.\nIt is useful to differentiate between three separate phases of production: conceptualization \"(determining what to say), formulation (translating the intention to say something into linguistic form), and execution (the detailed articulatory planning and articulation itself).\"<ref name=\"Psycholinguistics\">{{cite book |title=Psycholinguistics |date=2011|publisher=SAGE| last = Harley | first = Trevor A. | name-list-format = vanc |isbn=9781446263013|location=Los Angeles, Calif.|oclc=846651282}}</ref> Most psycholinguistic research has largely concerned itself with the study for formulation because the phase of conceptualization largely remains an elusive and mysterious period of development.<ref name=\"Psycholinguistics\"/>\n\nFor models of speech production, see [[v:Psycholinguistics/Models of Speech Production|Psycholinguistics/Models of Speech Production]].\n\n==Methodologies==\n\n===Behavioral tasks===\nMany of the experiments conducted in psycholinguistics, especially earlier on, are behavioral in nature. In these types of studies, subjects are presented with linguistic stimuli and asked to perform an action. For example, they may be asked to make a judgment about a word ([[lexical decision task|lexical decision]]), reproduce the stimulus, or name a visually presented word aloud. Reaction times to respond to the stimuli (usually on the order of milliseconds) and proportion of correct responses are the most often employed measures of performance in behavioral tasks. Such experiments often take advantage of [[priming (psychology)|priming effects]], whereby a \"priming\" word or phrase appearing in the experiment can speed up the lexical decision for a related \"target\" word later.<ref name=\"packard\"/>\n\nAs an example of how behavioral methods can be used in psycholinguistics research, Fischler (1977) investigated word encoding using the lexical decision task. He asked participants to make decisions about whether two strings of letters were English words. Sometimes the strings would be actual English words requiring a \"yes\" response, and other times they would be nonwords requiring a \"no\" response. A subset of the licit words were related semantically (e.g., cat-dog) while others were unrelated (e.g., bread-stem). Fischler found that related word pairs were responded to faster when compared to unrelated word pairs. This facilitation suggests that semantic relatedness can facilitate word encoding.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Fischler I | title = Semantic facilitation without association in a lexical decision task | journal = Memory & Cognition | volume = 5 | issue = 3 | pages = 335\u20139 | date = May 1977 | pmid = 24202904 | doi = 10.3758/bf03197580 | doi-access = free }}</ref>\n\n===Eye-movements===\nRecently, [[eye tracking]] has been used to study online language processing.

Assuming that eye movements are closely linked to the current focus of attention, language processing can be studied by monitoring eye movements while a subject is presented auditorily with linguistic input.\n\n===Language production errors===\n{{Main|Speech error}}\nThe [[Error analysis (linguistics)|analysis]] of systematic [[Speech error|errors in speech]], writing and [[Typographical error|typing]] of language as it is produced can provide evidence of the process which has generated it.  Errors of speech, in particular, grant insight into how the mind processes language production while a speaker is in the midst of an utterance. Speech errors tend to occur in the [[lexeme|lexical]], [[morpheme]], and [[phoneme]] encoding steps of language production, as seen by the ways errors can manifest.<ref name=\"linguisticsociety1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.linguisticsociety.org/resource/slips-tongue-windows-mind|title=Slips of the Tongue: Windows to the Mind {{!}} Linguistic Society of America|website=www.linguisticsociety.org|access-date=2017-05-02}}</ref>&nbsp;The types of speech errors, and some examples, are:<ref name=\"linguisticsociety1\"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.departments.bucknell.edu/linguistics/lectures/05lect16.html|title=Lecture No. 16 -- Speech Errors|website=www.departments.bucknell.edu|access-date=2017-05-02}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.omniglot.com/language/articles/speecherrors.htm|title=Speech Errors and What They Reveal About Language|website=www.omniglot.com|access-date=2017-05-02}}</ref>\n\n* Substitutions (phoneme and lexical) \u2013 replacing a sound with an unrelated sound, or a word with an antonym, and saying \"verbal&nbsp;'''outfit'''\" instead of \"verbal&nbsp;output\", or \"He rode his bike&nbsp;'''tomorrow'''\" instead of \"...yesterday\", respectively,\n* Blends \u2013 mixing two synonyms together and saying \"my&nbsp;'''stummy'''&nbsp;hurts\" in place of either \"stomach\" or \"tummy\",\n* Exchanges (phoneme [a.k.a.

For example, severing the [[corpus callosum]] (the bundle of nerves that connects the two hemispheres of the brain) was at one time a treatment for some forms of [[epilepsy]]. Researchers could then study the ways in which the comprehension and production of language were affected by such drastic surgery. Where an illness made brain surgery necessary, language researchers had an opportunity to pursue their research.\n\nNewer, non-invasive techniques now include brain imaging by [[positron emission tomography]] (PET); [[functional magnetic resonance imaging]] (fMRI); [[event-related potentials]] (ERPs) in [[electroencephalography]] (EEG) and [[magnetoencephalography]] (MEG); and [[transcranial magnetic stimulation]] (TMS). Brain imaging techniques vary in their spatial and temporal resolutions (fMRI has a resolution of a few thousand neurons per pixel, and ERP has millisecond accuracy).

There are a number of sub-disciplines with non-invasive techniques for studying the neurological workings of the brain; for example, [[neurolinguistics]] has become a field in its own right. Initial forays into psycholinguistics were found in philosophical and educational fields, due mainly to their location in departments other than applied sciences (e.g., cohesive data on how the human brain functioned).\n\nPsycholinguistics is concerned with the cognitive faculties and processes that are necessary in order for grammatical forms of language to be produced from a mental [[grammar]] and the [[lexicon]]. It is also concerned with the perception of these constructions by a listener. [[Developmental psycholinguistics]], as a branch of psycholinguistics, concerns itself with the child's ability to learn language.\n\n==Areas of study==\nPsycholinguistics is an interdisciplinary field. Hence, it is studied by researchers from a variety of different backgrounds, such as psychology, [[cognitive science]], linguistics, [[speech and language pathology]], and [[discourse analysis]]. Psycholinguists study many different topics, but these topics can generally be divided into answering the following questions: (1) how do children acquire language ([[language acquisition]])?; (2) how do people comprehend language (language comprehension)?; (3) how do people produce language (language production)?; and (4) how do people who already know one language acquire another one([[second language acquisition]])?\n\nSubdivisions in psycholinguistics are also made based on the different components that make up human [[language]].\n\nLinguistics-related areas:\n* [[Phonetics]] and [[phonology]] are concerned with the study of speech sounds. Within psycholinguistics, research focuses on how the brain processes and understands these sounds.\n* [[Morphology (linguistics)|Morphology]] is the study of word structures, especially the relationships between related words (such as ''dog'' and ''dogs'') and the formation of words based on rules (such as plural formation).\n* [[Syntax]] is the study of the patterns which dictate how words are combined to form sentences.\n* [[Semantics]] deals with the [[meaning (linguistic)|meaning]] of words and sentences. Where syntax is concerned with the formal structure of sentences, semantics deals with the actual meaning of sentences.\n* [[Pragmatics]] is concerned with the role of [[context (language use)|context]] in the interpretation of meaning.\n\nA researcher interested in language comprehension may study [[word]] recognition during [[reading (activity)|reading]] to examine the processes involved in the extraction of [[orthography|orthographic]], [[morphology (linguistics)|morphological]], [[phonological]], and [[semantic]] information from patterns in printed text. A researcher interested in language production might study how words are prepared to be spoken starting from the conceptual or semantic level (this concerns connotation, and possibly can be examined through the conceptual framework concerned with the [[semantic differential]]).

The first theory states that all language must be learned by the child.  The second view states that the abstract system of language cannot be learned, but that humans possess an innate language faculty, or an access to what has been called [[universal grammar]]. The view that language must be learned was especially popular before 1960 and is well represented by the [[Mentalism (psychology)|mentalistic]] theories of [[Jean Piaget]] and the empiricist [[Rudolf Carnap]]. Likewise, the school of psychology known as [[behaviorism]] (see [[Verbal Behavior]] (1957) by [[B.F. Skinner]]) puts forth the point of view that language is a behavior shaped by conditioned response, hence it is learned.\n\nThe innatist perspective began with [[Noam Chomsky]]'s highly critical review of Skinner's book in 1959.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Chomsky N, Skinner BF |year=1959 |title=A Review of B. F. Skinner's Verbal Behavior |journal=Language |issn=0097-8507 |volume=35 |issue=1 |pages=26\u201358 |doi=10.2307/411334  |jstor=411334}}</ref> This review helped to start what has been termed \"the [[cognitive revolution]]\" in psychology.  Chomsky posited humans possess a special, innate ability for language and that complex syntactic features, such as [[recursion]], are \"hard-wired\" in the brain. These abilities are thought to be beyond the grasp of the most intelligent and social non-humans. According to Chomsky, children acquiring a language have a vast search space to explore among all possible human grammars, yet at the time there was no evidence that children receive sufficient input to learn all the rules of their language (see [[poverty of the stimulus]]). Hence, there must be some other innate mechanism that endows a language ability to humans. Such a language faculty is, according to the [[innateness hypothesis]], what defines human language and makes it different from even the most sophisticated forms of animal communication.\n\nThe field of linguistics and psycholinguistics since then has been defined by reactions to Chomsky, pro and con. The pro view still holds that the human ability to use language (specifically the ability to use recursion) is qualitatively different from any sort of animal ability.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Hauser MD, Chomsky N, Fitch WT | title = The faculty of language: what is it, who has it, and how did it evolve? | journal = Science | volume = 298 | issue = 5598 | pages = 1569\u201379 | date = November 2002 | pmid = 12446899 | doi = 10.1126/science.298.5598.1569 }}</ref> This ability may {{Citation needed|date=May 2018}} have resulted from a favorable mutation or from an adaptation of skills evolved for other purposes. The view that language can be learned has had a recent resurgence inspired by [[emergentism]]. This view challenges the \"innate\" view as scientifically unfalsifiable; that is to say, it can't be tested. With the amount of computer power increasing since the 1980s, researchers have been able to simulate language acquisition using neural network models.<ref>{{cite book | title=Rethinking innateness: A connectionist perspective on development | last=Elman |first=Jeffrey | last2 = Bates | first2 = Elizabeth | last3 = Johnson | first3 = Mark | last4 = Karmiloff-Smith | first4 = Annette | last5 = Parisi | first5 = Domenico | last6 = Plunkett | first6 = Kim | name-list-format = vanc | year=1998 | publisher=The MIT Press}}</ref> These models provide evidence that there may, in fact, be sufficient information contained in the input to learn language, even syntax. If this is true, then an innate mechanism is no longer necessary to explain language acquisition.\n\n===Language comprehension===\n{{Main|Language comprehension}}\n\nThe structures and uses of language are related to the formation of ontological insights.<ref>{{Cite journal |jstor = 1400116|title = The Structure of the Chinese Language and Ontological Insights: A Collective-Noun Hypothesis|journal = Philosophy East and West|volume = 49|issue = 1|pages = 45\u201362|last1 = Mou|first1 = Bo | name-list-format = vanc |year = 1999|doi = 10.2307/1400116}}</ref> Some see this system as \"structured cooperation between language-users\" using \"conceptual difference\"\"[[semantic deference]]\" in order to exchange meaning and knowledge and give meaning to language, examining and describing \"semantic processes bound by a \u2018stopping\u2019 constraint which are not cases of ordinary deferring. Deferring is normally done for a reason, and a rational person is always disposed to defer if there is good reason.<ref>{{Cite journal |doi = 10.1111/1468-0017.00143|title = Reference and Deference|journal = Mind and Language|volume = 15|issue = 4|pages = 433\u2013451|year = 2000|last1 = Woodfield|first1 = Andrew | name-list-format = vanc }}</ref>\n\nThe theory of the [[Semantic differential]] supposes universal distinctions such as factors of \"Typicality\" (that included scales such as \"regular-rare\", \"typical-exclusive\"), \"Reality\" (\"imaginary-real\", \"evident-fantastic\", \"abstract-concrete\"), as well as factors of \"Complexity\" (\"complex-simple\", \"unlimited-limited\", \"mysterious-usual\"), \"Improvement\" or \"Organization\" (\"regular-spasmodic\", \"constant-changeable\", \"organized-disorganized\", \"precise-indefinite\"), Stimulation (\"interesting-boring\", \"trivial-new\"), calling it \" in the measurement of attitudes.<ref>Himmelfarb (1993) p 57</ref>\"\n\n==Reading==\nOne question in the realm of language comprehension is how people understand sentences as they read (also known as [[sentence processing]]). Experimental research has spawned a number of theories about the architecture and mechanisms of sentence comprehension. Typically these theories are concerned with what types of information contained in the sentence the reader can use to build meaning, and at what point in reading does that information become available to the reader. Issues such as \"[[modularity of mind|modular]]\" versus \"interactive\" processing have been theoretical divides in the field.\n\nA modular view of sentence processing assumes that the stages involved in reading a sentence function independently in separate modules. These modules have limited interaction with one another. For example, one influential theory of sentence processing, the garden-path theory,<ref>{{cite journal | title=Making and correcting errors during sentence comprehension: Eye movements in the analysis of structurally ambiguous sentences | vauthors = Frazier L, Rayner K | journal=Cognitive Psychology | volume=14 | issue=2 | pages=178\u2013210 | year=1982 | doi=10.1016/0010-0285(82)90008-1}}</ref> states that syntactic analysis takes place first. Under this theory as the reader is reading a sentence, he or she creates the simplest structure possible in order to minimize effort and cognitive load. This is done without any input from semantic analysis or context-dependent information. Hence, in the sentence \"The evidence examined by the lawyer turned out to be unreliable,\" by the time the reader gets to the word \"examined\" he or she has committed to a reading of the sentence in which the evidence is examining something because it is the simplest parse. This commitment is made despite the fact that it results in an implausible situation; we know from experience that evidence can rarely if ever examine something. Under this \"syntax first\" theory, semantic information is processed at a later stage. It is only later that the reader will recognize that he or she needs to revise the initial parse into one in which \"the evidence\" is being examined. In this example, readers typically recognize their misparse by the time they reach \"by the lawyer\" and must go back and re-parse the sentence.<ref>{{cite journal | title=The interaction of syntax and semantics during sentence processing: Eye movements in the analysis of semantically biased sentences | vauthors = Rayner K, Carlson M, Frazier L | journal=Journal of Verbal Learning and Verbal Behavior | volume=22 |issue=3 | pages=358\u2013374 | year=1983 | doi=10.1016/s0022-5371(83)90236-0}}</ref> This reanalysis is costly and contributes to slower reading times.\n\nIn contrast to a modular account, an interactive theory of sentence processing, such as a [[Constraint-based grammar|constraint-based]] lexical approach<ref>{{cite journal | title=Toward a lexical framework of constraint-based syntactic ambiguity resolution | vauthors = Trueswell J, Tanenhaus M | journal=Perspectives on Sentence Processing | pages=155\u2013179 | year=1994}}</ref> assumes that all available information contained within a sentence can be processed at any time. Under an interactive account, for example, the semantics of a sentence (such as plausibility) can come into play early on in order to help determine the structure of a sentence. Hence, in the sentence above, the reader would be able to make use of plausibility information in order to assume that \"the evidence\" is being examined instead of doing the examining. There are data to support both modular and interactive accounts; which account is the correct one is still up for debate.\n\nWhen reading, saccades can cause the mind to skip over words because it doesn\u2019t see them as important to the sentence, and the mind completely leaves it from the sentence or it replaces it with the wrong word. This can be seen in \u2018Paris in the the Spring\u2019. This is a common psychological test, where the mind will often skip the second \u2018the\u2019, especially when there is a line break in between the two.<ref> Drieghe, D., Rayner, K., & Pollatsek, A. (2005). Eye movements and word skipping during reading revisited. Journal of Experimental Psychology: Human Perception and Performance, 31(5), 954. </ref>\t\n\n===Language production===\n{{Main|Language production}}\nLanguage production concerns how people produce language, either in written or spoken form, in a way that conveys meanings comprehensible to others. One of the most effective ways to explain the way people represent meanings using rule-governed languages is by observing and analyzing instances of [[speech errors]]. They include speech dysfluencies like false starts, repetition, reformulation and constant pauses in between words or sentences; also, slips of tongue, like blendings, substitutions, exchanges (e.g. [[Spoonerism]]), and various pronunciation errors. These speech errors yield significant implication on language production, in that they reflect that:<ref>{{Cite journal | vauthors = Fromkin V |date=1973|title=Speech errors as linguistic evidence|journal=|volume=|pages=|hdl=11858/00-001M-0000-002B-2D04-D}}</ref>\n# Speech is planned in advance: speech errors like substitution and exchanges show that one does not plan his/her entire sentence before s/he speaks. Rather, their language faculty is constantly tapped during the speech production process. This is accounted for by the limitation of the working memory. In particular, errors involving exchanges imply that one plans ahead in their sentence but only about significant ideas (e.g. the words that constitute the core meaning) and only to a certain extent of the sentence.\n# Lexicon is organized semantically and phonologically: substitution and pronunciation errors show that lexicon is organized not only by its meaning, but also its form.\n# Morphologically complex words are assembled: errors involving blending within a word reflect that there seems to be a rule governing the construction of words in production (and also likely in mental lexicon). In other words, speakers generate the morphologically complex words by merging morphemes rather than retrieving them as chunks.\nIt is useful to differentiate between three separate phases of production: conceptualization \"(determining what to say), formulation (translating the intention to say something into linguistic form), and execution (the detailed articulatory planning and articulation itself).\"<ref name=\"Psycholinguistics\">{{cite book |title=Psycholinguistics |date=2011|publisher=SAGE| last = Harley | first = Trevor A. | name-list-format = vanc |isbn=9781446263013|location=Los Angeles, Calif.|oclc=846651282}}</ref> Most psycholinguistic research has largely concerned itself with the study for formulation because the phase of conceptualization largely remains an elusive and mysterious period of development.<ref name=\"Psycholinguistics\"/>\n\nFor models of speech production, see [[v:Psycholinguistics/Models of Speech Production|Psycholinguistics/Models of Speech Production]].\n\n==Methodologies==\n\n===Behavioral tasks===\nMany of the experiments conducted in psycholinguistics, especially earlier on, are behavioral in nature. In these types of studies, subjects are presented with linguistic stimuli and asked to perform an action. For example, they may be asked to make a judgment about a word ([[lexical decision task|lexical decision]]), reproduce the stimulus, or name a visually presented word aloud. Reaction times to respond to the stimuli (usually on the order of milliseconds) and proportion of correct responses are the most often employed measures of performance in behavioral tasks. Such experiments often take advantage of [[priming (psychology)|priming effects]], whereby a \"priming\" word or phrase appearing in the experiment can speed up the lexical decision for a related \"target\" word later.<ref name=\"packard\"/>\n\nAs an example of how behavioral methods can be used in psycholinguistics research, Fischler (1977) investigated word encoding using the lexical decision task. He asked participants to make decisions about whether two strings of letters were English words. Sometimes the strings would be actual English words requiring a \"yes\" response, and other times they would be nonwords requiring a \"no\" response. A subset of the licit words were related semantically (e.g., cat-dog) while others were unrelated (e.g., bread-stem). Fischler found that related word pairs were responded to faster when compared to unrelated word pairs. This facilitation suggests that semantic relatedness can facilitate word encoding.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Fischler I | title = Semantic facilitation without association in a lexical decision task | journal = Memory & Cognition | volume = 5 | issue = 3 | pages = 335\u20139 | date = May 1977 | pmid = 24202904 | doi = 10.3758/bf03197580 | doi-access = free }}</ref>\n\n===Eye-movements===\nRecently, [[eye tracking]] has been used to study online language processing. Beginning with Rayner (1978)<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Rayner K | title = Eye movements in reading and information processing | journal = Psychological Bulletin | volume = 85 | issue = 3 | pages = 618\u201360 | date = May 1978 | pmid = 353867 | doi = 10.1037/0033-2909.85.3.618 | citeseerx = 10.1.1.294.4262 }}</ref> the importance and informativity of eye-movements during reading was established.

Assuming that eye movements are closely linked to the current focus of attention, language processing can be studied by monitoring eye movements while a subject is presented auditorily with linguistic input.\n\n===Language production errors===\n{{Main|Speech error}}\nThe [[Error analysis (linguistics)|analysis]] of systematic [[Speech error|errors in speech]], writing and [[Typographical error|typing]] of language as it is produced can provide evidence of the process which has generated it.  Errors of speech, in particular, grant insight into how the mind processes language production while a speaker is in the midst of an utterance. Speech errors tend to occur in the [[lexeme|lexical]], [[morpheme]], and [[phoneme]] encoding steps of language production, as seen by the ways errors can manifest.<ref name=\"linguisticsociety1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.linguisticsociety.org/resource/slips-tongue-windows-mind|title=Slips of the Tongue: Windows to the Mind {{!}} Linguistic Society of America|website=www.linguisticsociety.org|access-date=2017-05-02}}</ref>&nbsp;The types of speech errors, and some examples, are:<ref name=\"linguisticsociety1\"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.departments.bucknell.edu/linguistics/lectures/05lect16.html|title=Lecture No. 16 -- Speech Errors|website=www.departments.bucknell.edu|access-date=2017-05-02}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.omniglot.com/language/articles/speecherrors.htm|title=Speech Errors and What They Reveal About Language|website=www.omniglot.com|access-date=2017-05-02}}</ref>\n\n* Substitutions (phoneme and lexical) \u2013 replacing a sound with an unrelated sound, or a word with an antonym, and saying \"verbal&nbsp;'''outfit'''\" instead of \"verbal&nbsp;output\", or \"He rode his bike&nbsp;'''tomorrow'''\" instead of \"...yesterday\", respectively,\n* Blends \u2013 mixing two synonyms together and saying \"my&nbsp;'''stummy'''&nbsp;hurts\" in place of either \"stomach\" or \"tummy\",\n* Exchanges (phoneme [a.k.a.

For example, severing the [[corpus callosum]] (the bundle of nerves that connects the two hemispheres of the brain) was at one time a treatment for some forms of [[epilepsy]]. Researchers could then study the ways in which the comprehension and production of language were affected by such drastic surgery. Where an illness made brain surgery necessary, language researchers had an opportunity to pursue their research.\n\nNewer, non-invasive techniques now include brain imaging by [[positron emission tomography]] (PET); [[functional magnetic resonance imaging]] (fMRI); [[event-related potentials]] (ERPs) in [[electroencephalography]] (EEG) and [[magnetoencephalography]] (MEG); and [[transcranial magnetic stimulation]] (TMS). Brain imaging techniques vary in their spatial and temporal resolutions (fMRI has a resolution of a few thousand neurons per pixel, and ERP has millisecond accuracy). Each type of methodology presents a set of advantages and disadvantages for studying a particular problem in psycholinguistics.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Aguirre GK | title = Functional neuroimaging: technical, logical, and social perspectives | journal = The Hastings Center Report | volume = Spec No | issue = s2 | pages = S8-18 | date = 2014-03-01 | pmid = 24634086 | doi = 10.1002/hast.294 | url = https://repository.upenn.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1145&context=neuroethics_pubs }}</ref>\n\n===Computational modeling===\nComputational modelling, such as the [[Dual-route hypothesis to reading aloud|DRC model]] of reading and word recognition proposed by [[Max Coltheart]] and colleagues,<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Coltheart M, Rastle K, Perry C, Langdon R, Ziegler J | title = DRC: a dual route cascaded model of visual word recognition and reading aloud | journal = Psychological Review | volume = 108 | issue = 1 | pages = 204\u201356 | date = January 2001 | pmid = 11212628 | doi = 10.1037/0033-295X.108.1.204 }}</ref> is another methodology and refers to the practice of setting up cognitive models in the form of executable computer programs. Such programs are useful because they require theorists to be explicit in their hypotheses and because they can be used to generate accurate predictions for theoretical models that are so complex that they render [[discursive psychology|discursive analysis]] unreliable. Other examples of computational modelling is [[James McClelland (psychologist)|McClelland]] and [[Jeff Elman|Elman's]] [[Trace (psycholinguistics)|TRACE]] model of speech perception<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = McClelland JL, Elman JL | title = The TRACE model of speech perception | journal = Cognitive Psychology | volume = 18 | issue = 1 | pages = 1\u201386 | date = January 1986 | pmid = 3753912 | doi = 10.1016/0010-0285(86)90015-0 }}</ref> and Franklin Chang's Dual-Path model of sentence production.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Chang|first=Franklin | name-list-format = vanc |date=September 2002|title=Symbolically speaking: a connectionist model of sentence production|journal=Cognitive Science|volume=26|issue=5|pages=609\u2013651|doi=10.1207/s15516709cog2605_3|issn=0364-0213|doi-access=free}}</ref>\n\n==Issues and areas of research==\nPsycholinguistics is concerned with the nature of the computations and processes that the brain undergoes to comprehend and produce language. For example, the [[cohort model]] seeks to describe how words are retrieved from the [[lexicon|mental lexicon]] when an individual hears or sees linguistic input.<ref name=\"packard\">{{cite book | author-link1 = Jerome Packard | last = Packard | first = Jerome L | name-list-format = vanc | date = 2000 | chapter = Chinese words and the lexicon | title = The Morphology of Chinese: A Linguistic and Cognitive Approach | location = Cambridge | publisher = Cambridge University Press | pages = 284\u2013309 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book | last = Altmann | first = Gerry T.M. | name-list-format = vanc | date = 1997 | chapter = Words, and how we (eventually) find them. | title = The Ascent of Babel: An Exploration of Language, Mind, and Understanding | location = Oxford | publisher = Oxford University Press | pages = 65\u201383 }}</ref>\n\nRecent research using new [[non-invasive]] imaging techniques seeks to shed light on just where certain language processes occur in the brain.\n\nThere are a number of unanswered questions in psycholinguistics, such as whether the human ability to use syntax is based on innate mental structures or emerges from interaction with other humans, and whether some animals can be taught the syntax of human language.\n\nTwo other major subfields of psycholinguistics investigate [[first language acquisition]], the process by which infants acquire language, and [[second language acquisition]]. In addition, it is much more difficult for adults to acquire [[second language]]s than it is for infants to learn their first language (bilingual infants are able to learn both of their native languages easily). Thus, [[critical period|sensitive periods]] may exist during which language can be learned readily.<ref>{{cite book | last = Seidner | first = Stanley S. | name-list-format = vanc | year = 1982 | title = Ethnicity, Language, and Power from a Psycholinguistic Perspective. | location = Bruxelles | publisher = Centre de recherche sur le pluralinguisme.| pages = 4\u20137 }}</ref> A great deal of research in psycholinguistics focuses on how this ability develops and diminishes over time.

Studies in aphasiology can both offer advances in therapy for individuals suffering from aphasia, and further insight into how the brain processes language.\n\nA 2016 empirical study showed that personal associations are mutually inter-related and that the concepts of self and world are internally connected via direct and mediated dependences, which reflects the structuring of perception and

(Torsion is clockwise or counterclockwise rotation around the line of sight when the eye is at its central primary position; defined this way, [[Listing's law]] says that, when the head is motionless, torsion is kept at zero.)\n\nHead-fixed saccades can have amplitudes of up to 90\u00b0 (from one edge of the oculomotor range to the other), but in normal conditions saccades are far smaller, and any shift of gaze larger than about 20\u00b0 is accompanied by a head movement. During such gaze saccades, first the eye produces a saccade to get gaze on target, whereas the head follows more slowly and the [[Vestibulo\u2013ocular reflex|vestibulo-ocular reflex]] (VOR) causes the eyes to roll back in the head to keep gaze on the target. Since the VOR can actually rotate the eyes around the line of sight, combined eye and head movements do not always obey [[Listing's law]].{{citation needed|reason=Took this from the previous version. Not which reference to use...|date=January 2015}}\n\n==Types==\nSaccades can be categorized by intended goal in four ways:<ref name=Rommelse>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.bandc.2008.08.025 |title=A review on eye movement studies in childhood and adolescent psychiatry |year=2008 |last1=Rommelse |first1=Nanda N.J. |last2=Van Der Stigchel |first2=Stefan |last3=Sergeant |first3=Joseph A. |journal=Brain and Cognition |volume=68 |issue=3 |pages=391\u2013414 |pmid=18835079}}</ref>\n\n* In a ''visually guided saccade'', the eyes move toward a visual transient, or stimulus. The parameters of visually guided saccades (amplitude, latency, peak velocity, and duration) are frequently measured as a baseline when measuring other types of saccades. Visually guided saccades can be further subcategorized:\n** A ''reflexive saccade'' is triggered exogenously by the appearance of a peripheral stimulus, or by the disappearance of a fixation stimulus.\n** A ''scanning saccade'' is triggered endogenously for the purpose of exploring the visual environment.\n* In an [[Antisaccade task|''antisaccade'']], the eyes move away from the visual onset. They are more delayed than visually guided saccades, and observers often make erroneous saccades in the wrong direction. A successful antisaccade requires inhibiting a reflexive saccade to the onset location, and voluntarily moving the eye in the other direction.\n* In a ''memory guided saccade'', the eyes move toward a remembered point, with no visual stimulus.\n* In a sequence of ''predictive saccades'', the eyes are kept on an object moving in a temporally and/or spatially predictive manner. In this instance, saccades often coincide with (or anticipate) the predictable movement of an object.\n\nAs referenced to above, it is also useful to categorize saccades by latency (time between go-signal and movement onset). In this case the categorization is binary: Either a given saccade is an ''express saccade'' or it is not. The latency cut-off is approximately ~200&nbsp;ms; any longer than this is outside the express saccade range.<ref name=\"FischerBoch1983\"/><ref name=\"FischerRamsperger1984\"/>\n\n[[Microsaccade]]s are a related type of [[Fixation (visual)|fixational eye movement]] that are small, jerk-like, involuntary [[Eye movement (sensory)|eye movements]], similar to miniature versions of voluntary saccades. They typically occur during visual [[Fixation (visual)|fixation]], not only in humans, but also in animals with [[Fovea centralis|foveal]] vision (primates, cats, etc.). Microsaccade amplitudes vary from 2 to 120 [[Arcminute|arcminutes]].\n\n==In depth==\nWhen exploring the visual environment with the gaze, humans make two to three fixations a second. Each fixation involves binocularly coordinated movements of the eyes to acquire the new target in three dimensions: horizontal and vertical, but also in-depth. In literature it has been shown how an upward or a vertical saccade is generally accompanied by a divergence of the eyes, while a downward saccade is accompanied by a convergence.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=J.T.

The phenomenon can be interpreted as an adaptation of rapid binocular eye movements to the statistics of the 3D environment, in order to minimize the need for corrective vergence movements at the end of saccades.\n\n==Pathophysiologic saccades==\nSaccadic oscillations not fitting the normal function are a deviation from a healthy or normal condition. [[Pathologic nystagmus|Nystagmus]] is characterised by the combination of 'slow phases', which usually take the eye off the point of regard, interspersed with saccade-like \"quick phases\" that serve to bring the eye back on target. Pathological slow phases may be due to either an imbalance in the [[vestibular system]] or damage to the [[brainstem]] \"neural integrator\" that normally holds the eyes in place. On the other hand, [[opsoclonus]] or [[ocular flutter]] are composed purely of fast-phase saccadic eye movements. Without the use of objective recording techniques, it may be very difficult to distinguish between these conditions.\n\nEye movement measurements are also used to investigate psychiatric disorders. For example, [[ADHD]] is characterized by an increase of antisaccade errors and an increase in delays for visually guided saccade.<ref name=Rommelse/>\n\n==Saccade adaptation==\nWhen the brain is led to believe that the saccades it is generating are too large or too small (by an experimental manipulation in which a saccade-target steps backward or forward contingent on the eye movement made to acquire it), saccade amplitude gradually decreases (or increases), an adaptation (also termed '''gain adaptation''') widely seen as a simple form of motor learning, possibly driven by an effort to correct visual error. This effect was first observed in humans with ocular muscle palsy.<ref name=\"Kommerell1976\">{{cite journal |pmid=955831 |year=1976 |last1=Kommerell |first1=G |last2=Olivier |first2=D |last3=Theopold |first3=H |title=Adaptive programming of phasic and tonic components in saccadic eye movements.

This led to the realization that visual or retinal error (the difference between the post-saccadic point of regard and the target position) played a role in the homeostatic regulation of saccade amplitude. Since then, much scientific research has been devoted to various experiments employing saccade adaptation.<ref name=\"Hopp2004\">{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.pneurobio.2003.12.002 |title=The characteristics and neuronal substrate of saccadic eye movement plasticity |year=2004 |last1=Hopp |first1=J.Johanna |last2=Fuchs |first2=Albert F |journal=Progress in Neurobiology |volume=72 |pages=27\u201353 |pmid=15019175 |issue=1}}</ref>\n\n==Reading==\nSaccadic eye movement allows the mind to read quickly, but it comes with its disadvantages. It can cause the mind to skip over words because it doesn't see them as important to the sentence, and the mind completely leaves it from the sentence or it replaces it with the wrong word. This can be seen in 'Paris in the{{nbsp}}the Spring'. This is a common psychological test, where the mind will often skip the second 'the', especially when there is a line break in between the two. \n\nWhen speaking, the mind plans what will be said before it is said. Sometimes the mind isn't able to plan in advance and the speech is rushed out. This is why there are errors like mispronunciation, stuttering, and unplanned pauses.  The same thing happens when reading. The mind doesn't always know what will come next. This is another reason that the second 'the' can be missed.<ref> Drieghe, D., Rayner, K., & Pollatsek, A.

Whereas low spatial frequencies (the 'fuzzier' parts) are attenuated, higher spatial frequencies (an image's fine details) that would otherwise be blurred by the eye movement remain unaffected.  This phenomenon, known as ''saccadic masking'' or ''saccadic suppression'', is known to begin prior to saccadic eye movements in every primate species studied, implying neurological reasons for the effect rather than simply the image's motion blur.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1523/JNEUROSCI.3950-08.2008 |doi-access=free |title=Saccadic Modulation of Neural Responses: Possible Roles in Saccadic Suppression, Enhancement, and Time Compression |year=2008 |last1=Ibbotson |first1=M.

The subject will not experience any movement of the eyes or any evidence that the optic nerve has momentarily ceased transmitting. Due to saccadic masking, the eye/brain system not only hides the eye movements from the individual but also hides the evidence that anything has been hidden. Of course, a second observer watching the experiment will see the subject's eyes moving back and forth. The function's main purpose is to prevent an otherwise significant smearing of the image.<ref name=\"eb\"/> (You can experience your eye saccade movements by using your cellphone's front-facing camera as a mirror, hold the cellphone screen a couple of inches away from your face as you saccade from one eye to the other\u2014the cellphone's signal processing delay allows you to see the end of the saccade movement.)\n\n===Spatial updating===\nWhen a visual stimulus is seen before a saccade, subjects are still able to make another saccade back to that image, even if it is no longer visible. This shows that the brain is somehow able to take into account the intervening eye movement. It is thought that the brain does this by temporarily recording a copy of the command for the eye movement, and comparing this to the remembered image of the target. This is called spatial updating. Neurophysiologists having recorded from cortical areas for saccades during spatial updating have found that memory-related signals get remapped during each saccade.{{Citation needed|date=October 2016}}\n\n===Trans-saccadic perception===\nIt is also thought that perceptual memory is updated during saccades so that information gathered across fixations can be compared and synthesized. However, the entire visual image is not updated during each saccade. Some scientists believe that this is the same as visual working memory, but as in spatial updating the eye movement has to be accounted for. The process of retaining information across a saccade is called trans-saccadic memory, and the process of integrating information from more than one fixation is called trans-saccadic integration.\n\n==Comparative physiology==\nSaccades are a widespread phenomenon across animals with image-forming visual systems. They have been observed in animals across three [[phylum|phyla]], including animals that do not have a [[Fovea centralis|fovea]] (most vertebrates do) and animals that cannot move their eyes independently of their head (such as insects).<ref name=\"pmid10555268\">{{cite journal |year=1999 |last1=Land |first1=MF |title=Motion and vision: Why animals move their eyes |volume=185 |issue=4 |pages=341\u201352 |journal=Journal of Comparative Physiology A |doi=10.1007/s003590050393 |pmid=10555268}}</ref> Therefore, while saccades serve in humans and other primates to increase the effective visual resolution of a scene, there must be additional reasons for the behavior. The most frequently suggested of these reasons is to avoid blurring of the image, which would occur if the response time of a [[photoreceptor cell]] is longer than the time a given portion of the image is stimulating that photoreceptor as the image drifts across the eye.\n\nIn birds, saccadic eye movements serve a further function.  The [[Bird vision#Anatomy of the eye|avian retina]] is highly developed. It is thicker than the [[mammalian eye|mammalian retina]], has a higher metabolic activity, and has less [[blood vessel|vasculature]] obstruction, for greater visual acuity.{{Citation needed|date=October 2016}} Because of this, the retinal cells must obtain nutrients via diffusion through the [[choroid]] and from the [[vitreous humor]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2016}} The [[pecten oculi|pecten]] is a specialised structure in the avian retina. It is a highly vascular structure that projects into the vitreous humor. Experiments show that, during saccadic eye oscillations (which occupy up to 12% of avian viewing time), the [[pecten oculi]] acts as an agitator, propelling perfusate (natural lubricants) toward the retina. Thus, in birds, saccadic eye movements appear to be important in retinal nutrition and [[cellular respiration]].<ref>{{cite journal |pmid=14756148 |year=1990 |last1=Pettigrew |first1=JD |last2=Wallman |first2=J |last3=Wildsoet |first3=CF |title=Saccadic oscillations facilitate ocular perfusion from the avian pecten |volume=343 |issue=6256 |pages=362\u20133 |doi=10.1038/343362a0 |journal=Nature|bibcode=1990Natur.343..362P }}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{commons category}}\n{{Div col|colwidth=20em}}\n*[[Chronostasis]]\n*[[Eye movement (sensory)|Eye movement]]\n*[[Eye movement in language reading]]\n*[[Eye movement in music reading]]\n*[[Eye tracking]]\n*[[Frame rate]]\n*[[Frontal eye fields]]\n*[[List of cognitive biases]]\n*[[Supplementary eye field]]\n*[[Medial eye fields]]\n*[[Paramedian pontine reticular formation]]\n*[[Raster scan]]\n*[[Saccadic masking]]\n*[[Saccadic suppression of image displacement]]\n*[[Smooth pursuit]]\n*[[Transsaccadic memory]]\n*[[Whip pan]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Visual system}}\n\n[[Category:Ethology]]\n[[Category:Eye]]\n[[Category:Vision]]\n[[Category:Saccade| ]]\n[[Category:Articles containing video clips]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Quick, simultaneous movement of both eyes between two or more phases of fixation in the same direction}}\n[[File:Szakkad.jpg|thumb|Trace of saccades of the human eye on a face while scanning]]\n[[File:This shows a recording of the eye movements of a participant looking freely at a picture.webm|thumb|200px |Saccades during observation of a picture on the computer screen]]\n\nA '''saccade''' ({{IPAc-en|s|\u0259|\u02c8|k|\u0251\u02d0|d}} {{respell|s\u0259|KAHD}}, [[French language|French]] for ''jerk'') is a quick, simultaneous movement of both [[Eye movement (sensory)|eyes]] between two or more phases of [[Fixation (visual)|fixation]] in the same direction.<ref name=\"Cassin\">Cassin, B. and Solomon, S.

During such gaze saccades, first the eye produces a saccade to get gaze on target, whereas the head follows more slowly and the [[Vestibulo\u2013ocular reflex|vestibulo-ocular reflex]] (VOR) causes the eyes to roll back in the head to keep gaze on the target.

The parameters of visually guided saccades (amplitude, latency, peak velocity, and duration) are frequently measured as a baseline when measuring other types of saccades. Visually guided saccades can be further subcategorized:\n** A ''reflexive saccade'' is triggered exogenously by the appearance of a peripheral stimulus, or by the disappearance of a fixation stimulus.\n** A ''scanning saccade'' is triggered endogenously for the purpose of exploring the visual environment.\n* In an [[Antisaccade task|''antisaccade'']], the eyes move away from the visual onset. They are more delayed than visually guided saccades, and observers often make erroneous saccades in the wrong direction. A successful antisaccade requires inhibiting a reflexive saccade to the onset location, and voluntarily moving the eye in the other direction.\n* In a ''memory guided saccade'', the eyes move toward a remembered point, with no visual stimulus.\n* In a sequence of ''predictive saccades'', the eyes are kept on an object moving in a temporally and/or spatially predictive manner. In this instance, saccades often coincide with (or anticipate) the predictable movement of an object.\n\nAs referenced to above, it is also useful to categorize saccades by latency (time between go-signal and movement onset). In this case the categorization is binary: Either a given saccade is an ''express saccade'' or it is not. The latency cut-off is approximately ~200&nbsp;ms; any longer than this is outside the express saccade range.<ref name=\"FischerBoch1983\"/><ref name=\"FischerRamsperger1984\"/>\n\n[[Microsaccade]]s are a related type of [[Fixation (visual)|fixational eye movement]] that are small, jerk-like, involuntary [[Eye movement (sensory)|eye movements]], similar to miniature versions of voluntary saccades.

Microsaccade amplitudes vary from 2 to 120 [[Arcminute|arcminutes]].\n\n==In depth==\nWhen exploring the visual environment with the gaze, humans make two to three fixations a second. Each fixation involves binocularly coordinated movements of the eyes to acquire the new target in three dimensions: horizontal and vertical, but also in-depth.

The phenomenon can be interpreted as an adaptation of rapid binocular eye movements to the statistics of the 3D environment, in order to minimize the need for corrective vergence movements at the end of saccades.\n\n==Pathophysiologic saccades==\nSaccadic oscillations not fitting the normal function are a deviation from a healthy or normal condition. [[Pathologic nystagmus|Nystagmus]] is characterised by the combination of 'slow phases', which usually take the eye off the point of regard, interspersed with saccade-like \"quick phases\" that serve to bring the eye back on target. Pathological slow phases may be due to either an imbalance in the [[vestibular system]] or damage to the [[brainstem]] \"neural integrator\" that normally holds the eyes in place. On the other hand, [[opsoclonus]] or [[ocular flutter]] are composed purely of fast-phase saccadic eye movements. Without the use of objective recording techniques, it may be very difficult to distinguish between these conditions.\n\nEye movement measurements are also used to investigate psychiatric disorders. For example, [[ADHD]] is characterized by an increase of antisaccade errors and an increase in delays for visually guided saccade.<ref name=Rommelse/>\n\n==Saccade adaptation==\nWhen the brain is led to believe that the saccades it is generating are too large or too small (by an experimental manipulation in which a saccade-target steps backward or forward contingent on the eye movement made to acquire it), saccade amplitude gradually decreases (or increases), an adaptation (also termed '''gain adaptation''') widely seen as a simple form of motor learning, possibly driven by an effort to correct visual error.

Since then, much scientific research has been devoted to various experiments employing saccade adaptation.<ref name=\"Hopp2004\">{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.pneurobio.2003.12.002 |title=The characteristics and neuronal substrate of saccadic eye movement plasticity |year=2004 |last1=Hopp |first1=J.Johanna |last2=Fuchs |first2=Albert F |journal=Progress in Neurobiology |volume=72 |pages=27\u201353 |pmid=15019175 |issue=1}}</ref>\n\n==Reading==\nSaccadic eye movement allows the mind to read quickly, but it comes with its disadvantages. It can cause the mind to skip over words because it doesn't see them as important to the sentence, and the mind completely leaves it from the sentence or it replaces it with the wrong word. This can be seen in 'Paris in the the Spring'. This is a common psychological test, where the mind will often skip the second 'the', especially when there is a line break in between the two. \n\nWhen speaking, the mind plans what will be said before it is said. Sometimes the mind isn't able to plan in advance and the speech is rushed out. This is why there are errors like mispronunciation, stuttering, and unplanned pauses.  The same thing happens when reading. The mind doesn't always know what will come next. This is another reason that the second 'the' can be missed.<ref> Drieghe, D., Rayner, K., & Pollatsek, A.

Whereas low spatial frequencies (the 'fuzzier' parts) are attenuated, higher spatial frequencies (an image's fine details) that would otherwise be blurred by the eye movement remain unaffected.  This phenomenon, known as ''saccadic masking'' or ''saccadic suppression'', is known to begin prior to saccadic eye movements in every primate species studied, implying neurological reasons for the effect rather than simply the image's motion blur.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1523/JNEUROSCI.3950-08.2008 |doi-access=free |title=Saccadic Modulation of Neural Responses: Possible Roles in Saccadic Suppression, Enhancement, and Time Compression |year=2008 |last1=Ibbotson |first1=M.

The subject will not experience any movement of the eyes or any evidence that the optic nerve has momentarily ceased transmitting. Due to saccadic masking, the eye/brain system not only hides the eye movements from the individual but also hides the evidence that anything has been hidden. Of course, a second observer watching the experiment will see the subject's eyes moving back and forth. The function's main purpose is to prevent an otherwise significant smearing of the image.<ref name=\"eb\"/> (You can experience your eye saccade movements by using your cellphone's front-facing camera as a mirror, hold the cellphone screen a couple of inches away from your face as you saccade from one eye to the other\u2014the cellphone's signal processing delay allows you to see the end of the saccade movement.)\n\n===Spatial updating===\nWhen a visual stimulus is seen before a saccade, subjects are still able to make another saccade back to that image, even if it is no longer visible. This shows that the brain is somehow able to take into account the intervening eye movement. It is thought that the brain does this by temporarily recording a copy of the command for the eye movement, and comparing this to the remembered image of the target. This is called spatial updating. Neurophysiologists having recorded from cortical areas for saccades during spatial updating have found that memory-related signals get remapped during each saccade.{{Citation needed|date=October 2016}}\n\n===Trans-saccadic perception===\nIt is also thought that perceptual memory is updated during saccades so that information gathered across fixations can be compared and synthesized. However, the entire visual image is not updated during each saccade. Some scientists believe that this is the same as visual working memory, but as in spatial updating the eye movement has to be accounted for. The process of retaining information across a saccade is called trans-saccadic memory, and the process of integrating information from more than one fixation is called trans-saccadic integration.\n\n==Comparative physiology==\nSaccades are a widespread phenomenon across animals with image-forming visual systems. They have been observed in animals across three [[phylum|phyla]], including animals that do not have a [[Fovea centralis|fovea]] (most vertebrates do) and animals that cannot move their eyes independently of their head (such as insects).<ref name=\"pmid10555268\">{{cite journal |year=1999 |last1=Land |first1=MF |title=Motion and vision: Why animals move their eyes |volume=185 |issue=4 |pages=341\u201352 |journal=Journal of Comparative Physiology A |doi=10.1007/s003590050393 |pmid=10555268}}</ref> Therefore, while saccades serve in humans and other primates to increase the effective visual resolution of a scene, there must be additional reasons for the behavior. The most frequently suggested of these reasons is to avoid blurring of the image, which would occur if the response time of a [[photoreceptor cell]] is longer than the time a given portion of the image is stimulating that photoreceptor as the image drifts across the eye.\n\nIn birds, saccadic eye movements serve a further function.  The [[Bird vision#Anatomy of the eye|avian retina]] is highly developed. It is thicker than the [[mammalian eye|mammalian retina]], has a higher metabolic activity, and has less [[blood vessel|vasculature]] obstruction, for greater visual acuity.{{Citation needed|date=October 2016}} Because of this, the retinal cells must obtain nutrients via diffusion through the [[choroid]] and from the [[vitreous humor]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2016}} The [[pecten oculi|pecten]] is a specialised structure in the avian retina. It is a highly vascular structure that projects into the vitreous humor. Experiments show that, during saccadic eye oscillations (which occupy up to 12% of avian viewing time), the [[pecten oculi]] acts as an agitator, propelling perfusate (natural lubricants) toward the retina. Thus, in birds, saccadic eye movements appear to be important in retinal nutrition and [[cellular respiration]].<ref>{{cite journal |pmid=14756148 |year=1990 |last1=Pettigrew |first1=JD |last2=Wallman |first2=J |last3=Wildsoet |first3=CF |title=Saccadic oscillations facilitate ocular perfusion from the avian pecten |volume=343 |issue=6256 |pages=362\u20133 |doi=10.1038/343362a0 |journal=Nature|bibcode=1990Natur.343..362P }}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{commons category}}\n{{Div col|colwidth=20em}}\n*[[Chronostasis]]\n*[[Eye movement (sensory)|Eye movement]]\n*[[Eye movement in language reading]]\n*[[Eye movement in music reading]]\n*[[Eye tracking]]\n*[[Frame rate]]\n*[[Frontal eye fields]]\n*[[List of cognitive biases]]\n*[[Supplementary eye field]]\n*[[Medial eye fields]]\n*[[Paramedian pontine reticular formation]]\n*[[Raster scan]]\n*[[Saccadic masking]]\n*[[Saccadic suppression of image displacement]]\n*[[Smooth pursuit]]\n*[[Transsaccadic memory]]\n*[[Whip pan]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Visual system}}\n\n[[Category:Ethology]]\n[[Category:Eye]]\n[[Category:Vision]]\n[[Category:Saccade| ]]\n[[Category:Articles containing video clips]]\n", "name_user": "Arjayay", "label": "safe", "comment": "add nbsp", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saccade"}
