Some refer to the resultant mode of Orthodox Judaism as Neo-Orthodoxy.\n\n==Derech Eretz==\nThe phrase ''Torah im Derech Eretz'' is first found in the [[Mishna]] in Tractate ''[[Avoth]]'' (2:2): \"Beautiful is the [[Torah study|study of Torah]] with ''Derech Eretz'', as involvement with both makes one forget sin\". The term ''Derech Eretz'', literally \"the way of the land\", is inherently ambiguous, with a wide range of meanings in [[Rabbinic literature]], referring to earning a livelihood and behaving appropriately, among others.<ref name=\"Y Goldson\"/><ref>{{citation | first = Gidon | last = Rothstein | url = http://www.rjconline.org/maharalhome.html | title = Maharal on Avot | website = RJConline.org | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20101031164210/http://www.rjconline.org/maharalhome.html | archivedate = 2010-10-31 }}.</ref>\n\n===Appropriate behaviour and good character===\n{{see|Proper behavior precedes the Torah}}\n[[Image:Virtue. La Vertu (NYPL b14140320-1638489).jpg|thumb|200px|Personification of virtue - one aspect of ''Derech Eretz.'']]\nIn the [[Talmud]] and [[Midrash]], there are approximately 200 teachings concerning ''Derech Eretz'' as decent, polite, respectful, thoughtful, and civilized behavior.<ref>{{citation | first = Jeff | last = Forsythe | url = http://www.shemayisrael.com/rabbiforsythe/interpersonal/derecheretz.htm | title = Derech Eretz: Civil, Polite and Thoughtful Behavior | publisher = Shema Yisrael}}.</ref> One representative teaching is that ''\"Derech Eretz comes before Torah\"'' (\u05d3\u05b6\u05bc\u05e8\u05b6\u05da\u05b0 \u05d0\u05b6\u05e8\u05b6\u05e5 \u05e7\u05b8\u05d3\u05b0\u05de\u05b8\u05d4 \u05dc\u05b7\u05ea\u05bc\u05d5\u05b9\u05e8\u05b8\u05d4 ''[[Midrash#Midrash Rabbah|Midrash Vayikra Rabbah]]'' 9:3) \u2013 one cannot personify Torah until he demonstrates ''Derech Eretz'' in everything that he does. \n\nThere are many more such teachings in the [[rishonim]] and [[acharonim]] (post-Talmudic authorities). The [[mussar literature]], in fact, presents an entire body of thought devoted to the subject of ''middot'' ([[character trait]]s) and \"behaving like a ''[[Mensch|mentsh]]''\" (refined human being). Here, the way that one behaves is regarded as an external manifestation of one's ''middot''.\n\n[[Nachman of Breslov]] takes the words ''comes before'' (in the above maxim) in a chronologic sense.  Thus, ''\"Derech eretz comes before Torah\",'' means that ''Derech Eretz'' is the original method to know part of the truth, and existed before the gift of the [[Torah]].\n\n===Earning a livelihood===\n[[Image:Lilien Blacksmith.jpg|thumb|200px|A blacksmith at work. Illustration by [[Ephraim Moses Lilien]] (1874\u20131925).]]\nThe meaning of ''Derech Eretz'' in the above Mishna is generally taken as \"earning a livelihood\",<ref>See for example [[Maimonides]], ''[[Mishnah#Commentaries|Commentary on the Mishna]]'' ''ad loc''</ref> and the Mishna is thus read as \"Beautiful is the study of Torah combined with 'earning a livelihood'\".

(See, for example, [[Kohelet Rabbah]] 1:34; [[Shlomo Ganzfried#Kitzur Shulchan Aruch|Kitzur Shulchan Aruch]] [http://www.kitzur.net/main.php?siman=31&black=false&nk=1 31:7]) Thus ''[[Pirkei Avot]]'' [http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/2032/jewish/Chapter-Four.htm 4:1]:\n{{quote|Who is rich?

After all, it is also true that work is a form of [[Gemilut Hasidim]] with benevolent \"intention\" so that someone could live in appropriate manner to have social and individual good civilization. Talmudic Jewish education considers that every father must try to teach a job or arrange for his descendants to be \"economically independent\". The very conception of [[Chavruta]] often implies a mutual agreement in this regard. -->\n\nIn Kabbalistic and Chassidic thought, also, <ref>''Likutey Halakhot I'' [[Jerusalem]]/[[New York City|New York]], [[Breslov Research Institute]]</ref> work is seen as having positive value: [[39 melachos|Thirty-Nine Acts of Labor]], encompassing all the types of work, were necessary in order to build the [[Tabernacle]]. Work became a necessity when [[Adam]] ate from the [[Tree of the knowledge of good and evil]], causing the sparks of holiness to fall to the [[Tzimtzum|Other Side]]. All our work, regardless of its spiritual or material purpose, serves to rebuild those [[Lurianic Kabbalah|Shattered Vessels]]. One who conducts his work or business honorably is considered as though he builds the Tabernacle.\n\n===Knowledge of the natural world===\n[[Image:Whilst time is unveiling, Science is exploring Nature CROPPED.jpg|thumb|200px|\"Whilst time is unveiling, Science is exploring Nature\". 18th century engraving by [[William Skelton]] (1763\u20131848), symbolizing knowledge of the natural world.]]\n[[Maharal]], Judah Loew (1525\u20131609), points out that ''Derech Eretz'' is not limited to \"earning a living\"; rather, the concept encompasses ''hanhaga tiv`it'', \"operating in the natural world\". Here, Maharal in his ''[[Maharal#Works|Derech Chaim]]'' comments on the later [[Mishna]], ''[[Avoth]]'' 3:21,<ref name=\"Y Goldson\"/> which discusses the interdependence of \"Torah and flour (''kemakh'')\" as well as the interdependence of \"Torah and ''Derech Eretz''\". ''Kemakh'', flour, clearly refers to monetary livelihood (with Torah referring to spiritual livelihood). Thus, ''Derech Eretz'' refers to more than just \"earning a livelihood\" and includes the knowledge and skills that facilitate success in the \"world of Nature\". See.<ref name=\"Rema_YD246_4\">[[Moses Isserles|Moshe Isserles (Rema)]] on ''[[Yoreh Deah]]'' [http://he.wikisource.org/wiki/%D7%A9%D7%95%D7%9C%D7%97%D7%9F_%D7%A2%D7%A8%D7%95%D7%9A_%D7%99%D7%95%D7%A8%D7%94_%D7%93%D7%A2%D7%94_%D7%A8%D7%9E%D7%95#.D7.A1.D7.A2.D7.99.D7.A3_.D7.93 siman 246:4] allows study of \u05e9\u05d0\u05e8 \u05d4\u05d7\u05db\u05de\u05d5\u05ea ([http://www.yeshiva.org.il/wiki/index.php?title=%D7%97%D7%9B%D7%9E%D7%95%D7%AA_%D7%97%D7%99%D7%A6%D7%95%D7%A0%D7%99%D7%95%D7%AA = non-Torah wisdom]), but limits this such that: this study is \u05d1\u05d0\u05e7\u05e8\u05d0\u05d9 (non-fixed, as required, secondary to Torah); and excludes study of  \u05e1\u05e4\u05e8\u05d9 \u05de\u05d9\u05e0\u05d9\u05dd (\"heretical works\").</ref>\n\n===Knowledge of culture and society===\n[[Image:Understanding-Reid-Highsmith.jpeg|thumb|200px|Understanding, mural by [[Robert Lewis Reid]] (1862\u20131929) in Library of Congress Thomas Jefferson Building, Washington, D.C.]]\nRabbi [[Samson Raphael Hirsch]] (1808{{spaced ndash}}1888), incorporating the above, was among the first to extend the definition of ''Derech Eretz'' to include a broad knowledge of, and appropriate interaction with, [[Western culture|culture and society]]. Hirsch states that \"''Derech Eretz'' includes everything that results from the fact that man's existence, mission and social life is conducted on [[Earth]], using earthly means and conditions. Therefore this term especially describes ways of earning a livelihood and maintaining the social order. It also includes the customs and considerations of [[etiquette]] that the [[social order]] generates as well as everything concerning [[humanities|humanistic]] and civil education\" ([[Exegesis|commentary]] on ''[[Avoth]]''). Hirsch's conception also [[entailment|entails]] the qualification that there be no compromise on strict adherence to [[Halakha|Jewish law]]. The resultant philosophy of [[Orthodox Judaism]] in the [[modern world]], referred to as \"''Torah im Derech Eretz''\", is discussed below.\n\n==Rabbi S.R. Hirsch==\n[[Image:Hermann Struck Grafik JMBerlin 2007 98 0.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Samson Raphael Hirsch]].]]\nWhen Hirsch first came to [[Frankfurt]] in 1851, he proclaimed ''Torah im Derech Eretz'' as the \"banner\" for his congregation, the ''Israelitische Religionsgesellschaft '' \u2014 the phrase has since been synonymous with Hirsch as well as with his philosophy. As seen, Hirsch was not unique in extending ''Derech Eretz'' to include broad knowledge of the [[secular]] world; rather, his role was to formalize a philosophy of ''Derech Eretz'' that incorporated a practical response to [[modernity]]. \nHirsch's philosophy has been variously interpreted within Orthodoxy. \n\n===Hirsch's ''Torah im Derech Eretz''===\nIn Hirsch's view, ''Derech Eretz'' refers not only to livelihood, but also to the social order, with the associated mores and considerations of courtesy and propriety, as well as to general education. Hirsch thus developed the concept of ''Derech Eretz'' to embrace [[Western culture]] while maintaining strict adherence to [[Halakha|Jewish law]] (see <ref name=\"Rema_YD246_4\"/> and <ref name=\"MB_155_156\"/>).\n\n====Worldly involvement====\n[[Image:Samson Raphael Hirsch. Bernard Drachman. The Nineteen Letters of Ben Uziel. 1899.pdf|thumb|200px|Cover of an 1899 edition of ''The Nineteen Letters of Ben Uziel'', where Hirsch lays out his program of ''Torah im Derech Eretz.'']]\nHirsch seeks to demonstrate in all his writings that the combination of Torah and ''Derech Eretz'' is not only possible but necessary if Judaism is to dominate not only the religious sphere of personal and communal life, but the secular, mundane sphere as well. To Hirsch, the fulfillment of [[Torah]]\u2014''Derech Eretz''\u2014therefore requires worldly involvement and general participation in society, as facilitated by the requisite knowledge.\n:\"Judaism is not a mere adjunct to life: it comprises all of life. To be a Jew is not a mere part, it is the sum total of our task in life. To be a Jew in the synagogue and the kitchen, in the field and the warehouse, in the office and the pulpit ... with the needle and the graving-tool, with the pen and the chisel\u2014that is what it means to be a Jew.\" (''Religion Allied to Progress'')\n\n====Secular culture and education====\nIn Hirsch's view, Judaism must \"include the conscientious promotion of education and culture\". Hirsch speaks of the ''Mensch-Yisroel'' (\"Israel-man\"), the \"enlightened religious personality\" as an ideal: that is the Jew who is proudly Jewish, a believer in the eternal values of the [[Torah]], but also possessing the ability to engage with and influence contemporary culture and knowledge.\n:\"The more, indeed, Judaism comprises the whole of man and extends its declared mission to [[Tikkun Olam|the salvation of the whole of mankind]], the less it is possible to confine its outlook to the synagogue. [Thus] the more the Jew is a Jew, the more universalist will be his views and aspirations [and] the less aloof will he be from ... art or science, culture or education ... [and] the more joyfully will he applaud whenever he sees truth and justice and peace and the ennoblement of man.\" (''Religion Allied to Progress'')\n\n====Jewish law====\nImportantly, Hirsch was very clear that ''Derech Eretz'' in no sense allows for [[halakha|halakhic]] compromise. In his view, Judaism is \"an untouchable sanctuary which must not be subjected to human judgment nor subordinated to human considerations\" and \"progress is valid only to the extent that it does not interfere with religion\". He states that \"the Jew will not want to accomplish anything that he cannot accomplish as a Jew. Any step which takes him away from Judaism is not for him a step forward, is not progress. He exercises this self-control without a pang, for he does not wish to accomplish his own will on earth but labours in the service of God.\" In ''The Nineteen Letters of Ben Uziel'' Hirsch remarked that it would have been better for the Jews not to have been emancipated if the price they had to pay was assimilation. (See also, [[Modern Orthodox Judaism#Standards of observance]].)\n\n===Interpretation===\n:''See also the [[Samson Raphael Hirsch#Influence and controversy|discussion]] on this point, in the article on Rabbi Hirsch.''\n\nAs mentioned, the philosophy of ''Torah im Derech Eretz'' has been variously interpreted within [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodoxy]]. The range of interpretations arises particularly in light of the tension between Hirsch's insistence as to faithfulness to Jewish law and tradition, and the challenges posed to this by interaction with the [[secular]] world.\n\nUnder a \"narrow interpretation\", exposure to secular philosophy, music, art, literature, or ethics must be functional. Under a \"median interpretation\", this exposure is permissible, and even required, for the sake of the domination of Torah values over one's [[mundane|worldly matters]]. Under a \"broad interpretation\" this exposure is permissible, providing a complement to \u2015 and even a synthesis with \u2015 Torah.\n\nThus as regards involvement in the secular world, the \"narrow interpretation\" essentially restricts ''Derech Eretz'' to a gainful occupation; permissible knowledge would be limited to functional and occupation related knowledge, and (possibly) secular knowledge that enables one to better interpret and understand the Torah. The \"median interpretation\" encourages the study of secular knowledge, but only insofar as this permits application of a Torah outlook and philosophy to human knowledge and culture. The \"broad interpretation\" permits the general acquisition of secular culture and knowledge as valuable in its own right.\n\n[[Image:Schiller lesend.jpg|thumb|200px|Interaction with modern culture is one aspect of ''Torah im Derech Eretz.'' Hirsch saw a common ground in values exposed by a philosopher like Schiller. The image, by [[Luise Duttenhofer]] (1776\u20131829), depicts Schiller reading.]]\nHirsch himself appears to have embraced the \"median interpretation\", albeit with the qualifications above. He states that \"''Torah im Derech Eretz'', as used by our sages, means the realization of Torah in harmonious unity with all the conditions under which its laws will have to be observed amidst the developments of changing times\" (''Gesammelte Schriften'' vii p.&nbsp;294). Thus on a regular basis, he quotes secular scientists in his [[Torah]] commentary. Some scholars believe that he was influenced by [[Hegel]] (1770\u20131831) and [[Friedrich Schiller]] (1759\u20131805) ;<ref>[https://www.ucalgary.ca/~elsegal/363_Transp/Orthodoxy/Hirsch.html Prof. E. Segal, University of Calgary];[http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/biography/Hirsch.html Avi Hein, jewishvirtuallibrary.org]</ref> in fact, in a speech given in the school he founded on the centenary of the birth of the latter, he claimed that the universalistic principles of [[Western culture]] embodied in Schiller's writings are Jewish values originating in the Torah.<ref>Mordechai Breuer, ''Modernity within Tradition'', p. 70</ref><ref>[[Yehuda (Leo) Levi|Professor Levi]] points out, however, that Rabbi Hirsch was required to make the speech for \"political reasons\" and that in this speech Hirsch \"did not even hint, not a single word, that the Jewish people had anything at all to learn from [Schiller's] ideas.\" See [http://www.daat.ac.il/daat/kitveyet/shana/harashar-4.htm \u05d4\u05e8\u05e9\"\u05e8 \u05d4\u05d9\u05e8\u05e9 \u05db\u05de\u05d5\u05e8\u05d4 \u05d3\u05e8\u05da \u05dc\u05d3\u05d5\u05e8\u05e0\u05d5 (''Rabbi Samson Raphael Hirsch as a guide for our generation'')], section: \u05d9\u05d4\u05d3\u05d5\u05ea \u05e2\u05dc \u05d8\u05d4\u05e8\u05ea \u05d4\u05e7\u05d5\u05d3\u05e9</ref>\n\nOn the other hand, Hirsch cautioned as to the danger of scientific knowledge leading one away from God; further, his schools, unlike others in [[Germany]] at the time, taught modern (business) languages as opposed to [[Classics|classical languages]]. Famously, in his commentary to [[Leviticus]] [http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/9919 18:4-5]  (see also [[Rashi]] [http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/9919/showrashi/true ''ad loc.'']), Hirsch clearly delineates the relationship of secular knowledge and Torah, where Torah is \"''ikkar''\" (\u05e2\u05d9\u05e7\u05e8), the essential, while secular knowledge is \"''tefel''\" (\u05d8\u05e4\u05dc), secondary or supplementary to Torah. He states that \"[w]e are confident that there is only one truth, and only one body of knowledge that can serve as the standard... Compared to it, all the other sciences are valid only provisionally\".\n\nHis [http://www.aishdas.org/avodah/vol27/v27n149.shtml#01 commentary on] [[Deuteronomy]] [http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/9970 6:7] is perhaps more explicit:\n:\"The study of the Torah shall be our main intellectual pursuit... We are not to study Torah from the standpoint of another science or for the sake of that science. So, too, we are to be careful not to introduce into the sphere of the Torah foreign ideas... Rather, we should always be mindful of the superiority of the Torah, which differs from all other scientific knowledge through its Divine origin... [Our Sages] do not demand of us to completely ignore all the scientific knowledge... [but rather] that a person [be] familiar with these other realms of knowledge, but ... only from the Torah's perspective ... and they warn us that neglecting this perspective will jeopardize our intellectual life.\"\n\n===Neo-Orthodoxy: the \"Breuer\" communities===\nIn 1851, Hirsch was called to become the rabbi of the breakaway Orthodox community of [[Frankfurt am Main]]. This community soon became the model for \"modern communities\" strict in adherence to Orthodox practices, sometimes called, \"Frankfurter Orthodoxy\". Hirsch's son-in-law Rabbi Dr. [[Solomon Breuer|Shlomo Zalman (Solomon) Breuer]], succeeded him after his death. Wary of establishing a dynasty, the Frankfurt community did not appoint Hirsch's son to be his successor.\n\nAfter [[World War I]], in order to show their rejection of religious liberalism, followers of the community started to call themselves \"Neo-Orthodox\"; this mirrored the parallel movement in [[Lutheranism]] (called \"[[Neo-orthodoxy|Neo-Orthodoxy]]\"). Thus, at this point, Hirsch's [[Romanticism|romantic liberalism]] and the values of the [[Revolutions of 1848 in the German states|1848 struggle for civil rights]] were less relevant \u2013 and the rejection of many elements of [[Weimar Republic|Weimar]] [[Weimar culture|German culture]] was prevalent. [[Solomon Breuer]] and [[Isaac Breuer]] were leaders of this conservative turn by the community.<ref>Mordechai Breuer, ''Modernity within Tradition'', chapter 7</ref>\n\nFollowing [[Kristallnacht]], Breuer and his family emigrated to [[Antwerp]], and then to [[New York City]]. Once in New York, Breuer started a congregation among the numerous German refugees in [[Washington Heights, Manhattan|Washington Heights]], which closely followed the customs and mores of the Frankfurt community. The congregation, [[Khal Adath Yeshurun]], is colloquially known as \"Breuer's\". Rabbi [[Shimon Schwab]], also a native of Frankfurt, served as the second Rabbi of the \"Breuer\" community, until his death in 1995. Solomon Breuer and Joseph Breuer are often regarded as Hirsch's intellectual heirs, while Schwab is regarded as aligned with the more traditional [[Lithuania]]n orthodox communities.\n\nThe Breuer community has cautiously applied ''Torah im Derech Eretz'' to [[Culture of the United States|American life]], narrowing its application over time.<ref name=\"Controversial Moments\">In fact, as of 2008 there has been some conflict between leading members of the community as to which direction it should take: see under [[Khal Adath Jeshurun (Washington Heights, Manhattan)]] and [http://www.jewishpress.com/displaycontent_new.cfm?contentid=33512&mode=a&contentname=Controversial_Moments_At_Rav_S._R._Hirsch_Memorial_Celebration Controversial Moments At Rav S.R. Hirsch Memorial Celebration, Article by Elliot Resnick, The Jewish Press, Friday, June 27, 2008, p. 18] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080630202518/http://www.jewishpress.com/displaycontent_new.cfm?contentid=33512&mode=a&contentname=Controversial_Moments_At_Rav_S._R._Hirsch_Memorial_Celebration |date=June 30, 2008 }}</ref> Schwab warned of the dangers of contemporary moral attitudes in secular culture and literature, and emphasized that followers of Neo-Orthodoxy therefore require a strong basis of faith and knowledge, and must exercise caution in engagements with the secular world.\n\nSchwab also frequently emphasized that Torah can never be regarded as parallel with the secular knowledge. \"[[Torah study]] is the highest duty of the Jew\", and \"even to suggest that anything can be parallel to Torah is a blasphemy of the highest order; Torah is above all, and everything else in life must be conducted in accordance with the [[Torah|Written]] and [[Oral law|Oral Torah]].\" Still, entry into commerce or the professions is seen as a valid component of Torah life, to be facilitated by an appropriate secular education (with the caveat that campus life is \"incontestably immoral\"). \"Carrying on one's professional life in consonance with the ''[[halakha]]'' is in itself a practice of Torah.\" One must \"establish the Torah's primacy over the modes of business and professional life so that his behavior transforms even that 'mundane' portion of his life into a sanctification.\"\n\nThe community is positioned ideologically outside of both [[Modern Orthodoxy]] and [[Haredi Judaism]] (\"Ultra-Orthodoxy\"). As regards Haredi Judaism, Schwab acknowledged that although Neo-Orthodoxy is not the path openly espoused by the majority of today's ''[[Rosh yeshiva|Roshei Yeshiva]]'', the \"Torah Only\" and ''Torah Im Derech Eretz'' camps can exist side-by-side. \"As long as one is prompted solely by ''Yiras Shamayim'' (\"fear of Heaven\") and a search for truth, each individual has a choice as to which school he should follow.\" Practically, the community is fully engaged with haredi [[Agudath Yisrael of America]], while it shuns the more modern [[Orthodox Union]].\n\nThe movement is somewhat distant from Modern Orthodoxy. Schwab regards Modern Orthodoxy as having misinterpreted Hirsch's ideas: regarding standards of ''[[halakha]]'' as well as the relative emphasis of Torah versus secular; see discussion under [[Torah Umadda#Neo-Orthodoxy|Torah Umadda]]. Further, Breuer, influenced by Hirsch's philosophy on ''[[Samson Raphael Hirsch#Frankfurt am Main|Austritt]]'' (secession), \"could not countenance recognition of a non-believing body as a legitimate representative of the Jewish people\". For this reason, he was \"unalterably opposed to the ''[[Mizrachi (religious Zionism)|Mizrachi]]'' movement, which remained affiliated with the [[World Zionist Organization]] and the [[Jewish Agency]]\".\n\n===Contemporary influence===\n''Torah im Derech Eretz'' remains influential as a philosophy in [[Orthodox Judaism]]. Although usually associated with the \"[[Joseph Breuer|Breuer]]\" community of [[Washington Heights, Manhattan|Washington Heights]], the philosophy remains an important influence in [[Modern Orthodox Judaism]] and, to some extent, in ''[[Haredi Judaism]]''. (See also [[Divine Providence#Contemporary Orthodox thought|Divine Providence]] for discussion of ''derech eretz'' in contemporary Orthodox Judaism.)\n\n====Modern Orthodoxy====\n''Torah im Derech Eretz'' is a major source of ideology for [[Modern Orthodoxy]], particularly regarding the synthesis of Judaism and secular culture. Organizations on the left of Modern Orthodoxy have embraced the \"broad interpretation\", although critics say that, philosophical issues aside, their \"relatively relaxed stance\" in ''[[halakha]]'' in fact positions them outside the realm of ''Torah im Derech Eretz''.\n\nFurther to the right, the \"broad interpretation\" is largely identical with ''[[Torah Umadda]]''\u2014Torah and secular knowledge\u2014a philosophy of Modern Orthodoxy closely associated with [[Yeshiva University]], which aims at synthesizing Torah learning and secular knowledge within the personality. The two are nevertheless distinct in terms of emphasis. Under ''Torah Umadda'', \"[w]e prefer to look upon science and religion as separate domains...\" ([[Samuel Belkin]], inaugural address, 1943), whereas ''Torah im Derech Eretz'', aims at the domination of Torah over secular knowledge and the application of Torah thought to secular knowledge. See [[Torah Umadda#Neo-Orthodoxy|further]] under ''Torah Umadda''.\n\n====Neo-Orthodoxy====\nAs above, the \"Breuer\" community continues to closely apply the philosophy. However, since [[World War II]], the community, has moved away from the \"median interpretation\" toward the \"narrow interpretation\", as above.<ref name=\"Controversial Moments\"/> Rabbi Breuer saw the risk of misinterpretation of his grandfather's ideas (and confusion with [[Torah Umadda]]) especially post-war. He repeatedly stated that compromising on Jewishness and ''[[halakha]]'' was at variance with ''Torah im Derech Eretz'', and emphasized the distinction between Modern Orthodoxy and Neo-Orthodoxy as regards the relationship between Torah and secular. \"Rabbi Hirsch's fight was not for balance and not for reconcilement, nor for synthesis and certainly not for parallel power, but for domination \u2013 for the true and absolute domination of the divine precept over the new tendencies\" (Isaac Breuer, Hirsch's grandson). See [[Samson Raphael Hirsch#Influence and controversy|further]] in the article on Rabbi Hirsch and [[Modern Orthodox Judaism#Neo-Orthodoxy/Torah Im Derech Eretz|additionally]] under Modern Orthodoxy.\n\n====Haredi Judaism====\n[[Image:Bais-Yaakov-1.jpg|thumb|250px|''Torah im Derech Eretz'' shaped the curriculum of the Beis Yaakov school system. The second graduating class of the Beis Yaakov in Lodz, Poland, in 1934.]]\nToday, the [[Haredi Judaism|Haredi]] \"[[Haredi Judaism#United States|Yeshiva communities]]\" adhere to the \"narrow interpretation\" as an educational philosophy. ''Torah im Derech Eretz'' was the basic idea that shaped the curriculum of the [[Beis Yaakov]] school system, and continues to be influential. (In fact, in her Seminary in [[Krak\u00f3w]], [[Sarah Schenirer]] taught Rav Hirsch's writings in [[German language|German]]. The (German-born) teachers spoke German and the Polish students learned German.<ref>Chevroni, M. ''The Contribution of German Chareidim to the New Yishuv''</ref>) Similarly, the \"narrow interpretation\" guides the curricula at boys' high schools.\n\nOther Haredi communities, the \"Torah only\" school, are further distant from ''Torah im Derech Eretz''. Since [[World War II]] there has been an ideological tendency in that camp to devote all intellectual capabilities to Torah study only\u2014in schools, ''[[yeshiva|yeshivot]]'' and ''[[kollel]]s''. Thus, the optimum course to be adopted in all cases is to devote oneself to full-time Torah learning for as long as possible; \"to go out into the world is a course to be adopted only when there is no other alternative\".<ref>Aryeh Carmell, ''Torah Im Derech Eretz''</ref> Here, the Hirschian model is seen as ''horaat sha'ah'', a \"time specific teaching\" intended to apply to the special circumstances of [[Western Europe]] in the 1800s.<ref>A strong case can actually be made for the idea that the \"Torah only\" is in itself a ''horaat sha'ah'' adopted in the wake of the destruction of the major Torah centers during the Holocaust. ([[Yehuda (Leo) Levi|Levi]] 1990)</ref> (Note that Hirsch himself addressed this contention: \"''Torah im Derech Eretz'' ... is not part of troubled, time bound notions; it represents the ancient, traditional wisdom of our sages that has stood the test everywhere and at all times.\" (''Gesammelte Schriften'' vi p.&nbsp;221); see further under [[Joseph Breuer]].)\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n'''Torah im Derech Eretz'''\n*Berman, Saul J.

The [[mussar literature]], in fact, presents an entire body of thought devoted to the subject of ''middot'' ([[character trait]]s) and \"behaving like a ''[[Mensch|mentsh]]''\" (refined human being). Here, the way that one behaves is regarded as an external manifestation of one's ''middot''.\n\n[[Nachman of Breslov]] takes the words ''comes before'' (in the above maxim) in a chronologic sense.  Thus, ''\"Derech eretz comes before Torah\",'' means that ''Derech Eretz'' is the original method to know part of the truth, and existed before the gift of the [[Torah]].\n\n===Earning a livelihood===\n[[Image:Lilien Blacksmith.jpg|thumb|200px|A blacksmith at work.

Talmudic Jewish education considers that every father must try to teach a job or arrange for his descendants to be \"economically independent\".

Here, Maharal in his ''[[Maharal#Works|Derech Chaim]]'' comments on the later [[Mishna]], ''[[Avoth]]'' 3:21,<ref name=\"Y Goldson\"/> which discusses the interdependence of \"Torah and flour (''kemakh'')\" as well as the interdependence of \"Torah and ''Derech Eretz''\". ''Kemakh'', flour, clearly refers to monetary livelihood (with Torah referring to spiritual livelihood). Thus, ''Derech Eretz'' refers to more than just \"earning a livelihood\" and includes the knowledge and skills that facilitate success in the \"world of Nature\". See.<ref name=\"Rema_YD246_4\">[[Moses Isserles|Moshe Isserles (Rema)]] on ''[[Yoreh Deah]]'' [http://he.wikisource.org/wiki/%D7%A9%D7%95%D7%9C%D7%97%D7%9F_%D7%A2%D7%A8%D7%95%D7%9A_%D7%99%D7%95%D7%A8%D7%94_%D7%93%D7%A2%D7%94_%D7%A8%D7%9E%D7%95#.D7.A1.D7.A2.D7.99.D7.A3_.D7.93 siman 246:4] allows study of \u05e9\u05d0\u05e8 \u05d4\u05d7\u05db\u05de\u05d5\u05ea ([http://www.yeshiva.org.il/wiki/index.php?title=%D7%97%D7%9B%D7%9E%D7%95%D7%AA_%D7%97%D7%99%D7%A6%D7%95%D7%A0%D7%99%D7%95%D7%AA = non-Torah wisdom]), but limits this such that: this study is \u05d1\u05d0\u05e7\u05e8\u05d0\u05d9 (non-fixed, as required, secondary to Torah); and excludes study of  \u05e1\u05e4\u05e8\u05d9 \u05de\u05d9\u05e0\u05d9\u05dd (\"heretical works\").</ref>\n\n===Knowledge of culture and society===\n[[Image:Understanding-Reid-Highsmith.jpeg|thumb|200px|Understanding, mural by [[Robert Lewis Reid]] (1862\u20131929) in Library of Congress Thomas Jefferson Building, Washington, D.C.]]\nRabbi [[Samson Raphael Hirsch]] (1808{{spaced ndash}}1888), incorporating the above, was among the first to extend the definition of ''Derech Eretz'' to include a broad knowledge of, and appropriate interaction with, [[Western culture|culture and society]]. Hirsch states that \"''Derech Eretz'' includes everything that results from the fact that man's existence, mission and social life is conducted on [[Earth]], using earthly means and conditions. Therefore this term especially describes ways of earning a livelihood and maintaining the social order. It also includes the customs and considerations of [[etiquette]] that the [[social order]] generates as well as everything concerning [[humanities|humanistic]] and civil education\" ([[Exegesis|commentary]] on ''[[Avoth]]''). Hirsch's conception also [[entailment|entails]] the qualification that there be no compromise on strict adherence to [[Halakha|Jewish law]]. The resultant philosophy of [[Orthodox Judaism]] in the [[modern world]], referred to as \"''Torah im Derech Eretz''\", is discussed below.\n\n==Rabbi S.R. Hirsch==\n[[Image:Hermann Struck Grafik JMBerlin 2007 98 0.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Samson Raphael Hirsch]].]]\nWhen Hirsch first came to [[Frankfurt]] in 1851, he proclaimed ''Torah im Derech Eretz'' as the \"banner\" for his congregation, the ''Israelitische Religionsgesellschaft '' \u2014 the phrase has since been synonymous with Hirsch as well as with his philosophy. As seen, Hirsch was not unique in extending ''Derech Eretz'' to include broad knowledge of the [[secular]] world; rather, his role was to formalize a philosophy of ''Derech Eretz'' that incorporated a practical response to [[modernity]]. \nHirsch's philosophy has been variously interpreted within Orthodoxy. \n\n===Hirsch's ''Torah im Derech Eretz''===\nIn Hirsch's view, ''Derech Eretz'' refers not only to livelihood, but also to the social order, with the associated mores and considerations of courtesy and propriety, as well as to general education. Hirsch thus developed the concept of ''Derech Eretz'' to embrace [[Western culture]] while maintaining strict adherence to [[Halakha|Jewish law]] (see <ref name=\"Rema_YD246_4\"/> and <ref name=\"MB_155_156\"/>).\n\n====Worldly involvement====\n[[Image:Samson Raphael Hirsch. Bernard Drachman. The Nineteen Letters of Ben Uziel. 1899.pdf|thumb|200px|Cover of an 1899 edition of ''The Nineteen Letters of Ben Uziel'', where Hirsch lays out his program of ''Torah im Derech Eretz.'']]\nHirsch seeks to demonstrate in all his writings that the combination of Torah and ''Derech Eretz'' is not only possible but necessary if Judaism is to dominate not only the religious sphere of personal and communal life, but the secular, mundane sphere as well. To Hirsch, the fulfillment of [[Torah]]\u2014''Derech Eretz''\u2014therefore requires worldly involvement and general participation in society, as facilitated by the requisite knowledge.\n:\"Judaism is not a mere adjunct to life: it comprises all of life. To be a Jew is not a mere part, it is the sum total of our task in life. To be a Jew in the synagogue and the kitchen, in the field and the warehouse, in the office and the pulpit ... with the needle and the graving-tool, with the pen and the chisel\u2014that is what it means to be a Jew.\" (''Religion Allied to Progress'')\n\n====Secular culture and education====\nIn Hirsch's view, Judaism must \"include the conscientious promotion of education and culture\". Hirsch speaks of the ''Mensch-Yisroel'' (\"Israel-man\"), the \"enlightened religious personality\" as an ideal: that is the Jew who is proudly Jewish, a believer in the eternal values of the [[Torah]], but also possessing the ability to engage with and influence contemporary culture and knowledge.\n:\"The more, indeed, Judaism comprises the whole of man and extends its declared mission to [[Tikkun Olam|the salvation of the whole of mankind]], the less it is possible to confine its outlook to the synagogue. [Thus] the more the Jew is a Jew, the more universalist will be his views and aspirations [and] the less aloof will he be from ... art or science, culture or education ... [and] the more joyfully will he applaud whenever he sees truth and justice and peace and the ennoblement of man.\" (''Religion Allied to Progress'')\n\n====Jewish law====\nImportantly, Hirsch was very clear that ''Derech Eretz'' in no sense allows for [[halakha|halakhic]] compromise. In his view, Judaism is \"an untouchable sanctuary which must not be subjected to human judgment nor subordinated to human considerations\" and \"progress is valid only to the extent that it does not interfere with religion\". He states that \"the Jew will not want to accomplish anything that he cannot accomplish as a Jew. Any step which takes him away from Judaism is not for him a step forward, is not progress. He exercises this self-control without a pang, for he does not wish to accomplish his own will on earth but labours in the service of God.\" In ''The Nineteen Letters of Ben Uziel'' Hirsch remarked that it would have been better for the Jews not to have been emancipated if the price they had to pay was assimilation. (See also, [[Modern Orthodox Judaism#Standards of observance]].)\n\n===Interpretation===\n:''See also the [[Samson Raphael Hirsch#Influence and controversy|discussion]] on this point, in the article on Rabbi Hirsch.''\n\nAs mentioned, the philosophy of ''Torah im Derech Eretz'' has been variously interpreted within [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodoxy]]. The range of interpretations arises particularly in light of the tension between Hirsch's insistence as to faithfulness to Jewish law and tradition, and the challenges posed to this by interaction with the [[secular]] world.\n\nUnder a \"narrow interpretation\", exposure to secular philosophy, music, art, literature, or ethics must be functional. Under a \"median interpretation\", this exposure is permissible, and even required, for the sake of the domination of Torah values over one's [[mundane|worldly matters]]. Under a \"broad interpretation\" this exposure is permissible, providing a complement to \u2015 and even a synthesis with \u2015 Torah.\n\nThus as regards involvement in the secular world, the \"narrow interpretation\" essentially restricts ''Derech Eretz'' to a gainful occupation; permissible knowledge would be limited to functional and occupation related knowledge, and (possibly) secular knowledge that enables one to better interpret and understand the Torah. The \"median interpretation\" encourages the study of secular knowledge, but only insofar as this permits application of a Torah outlook and philosophy to human knowledge and culture. The \"broad interpretation\" permits the general acquisition of secular culture and knowledge as valuable in its own right.\n\n[[Image:Schiller lesend.jpg|thumb|200px|Interaction with modern culture is one aspect of ''Torah im Derech Eretz.'' Hirsch saw a common ground in values exposed by a philosopher like Schiller. The image, by [[Luise Duttenhofer]] (1776\u20131829), depicts Schiller reading.]]\nHirsch himself appears to have embraced the \"median interpretation\", albeit with the qualifications above. He states that \"''Torah im Derech Eretz'', as used by our sages, means the realization of Torah in harmonious unity with all the conditions under which its laws will have to be observed amidst the developments of changing times\" (''Gesammelte Schriften'' vii p.&nbsp;294). Thus on a regular basis, he quotes secular scientists in his [[Torah]] commentary. Some scholars believe that he was influenced by [[Hegel]] (1770\u20131831) and [[Friedrich Schiller]] (1759\u20131805) ;<ref>[https://www.ucalgary.ca/~elsegal/363_Transp/Orthodoxy/Hirsch.html Prof. E. Segal, University of Calgary];[http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/biography/Hirsch.html Avi Hein, jewishvirtuallibrary.org]</ref> in fact, in a speech given in the school he founded on the centenary of the birth of the latter, he claimed that the universalistic principles of [[Western culture]] embodied in Schiller's writings are Jewish values originating in the Torah.<ref>Mordechai Breuer, ''Modernity within Tradition'', p. 70</ref><ref>[[Yehuda (Leo) Levi|Professor Levi]] points out, however, that Rabbi Hirsch was required to make the speech for \"political reasons\" and that in this speech Hirsch \"did not even hint, not a single word, that the Jewish people had anything at all to learn from [Schiller's] ideas.\" See [http://www.daat.ac.il/daat/kitveyet/shana/harashar-4.htm \u05d4\u05e8\u05e9\"\u05e8 \u05d4\u05d9\u05e8\u05e9 \u05db\u05de\u05d5\u05e8\u05d4 \u05d3\u05e8\u05da \u05dc\u05d3\u05d5\u05e8\u05e0\u05d5 (''Rabbi Samson Raphael Hirsch as a guide for our generation'')], section: \u05d9\u05d4\u05d3\u05d5\u05ea \u05e2\u05dc \u05d8\u05d4\u05e8\u05ea \u05d4\u05e7\u05d5\u05d3\u05e9</ref>\n\nOn the other hand, Hirsch cautioned as to the danger of scientific knowledge leading one away from God; further, his schools, unlike others in [[Germany]] at the time, taught modern (business) languages as opposed to [[Classics|classical languages]]. Famously, in his commentary to [[Leviticus]] [http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/9919 18:4-5]  (see also [[Rashi]] [http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/9919/showrashi/true ''ad loc.'']), Hirsch clearly delineates the relationship of secular knowledge and Torah, where Torah is \"''ikkar''\" (\u05e2\u05d9\u05e7\u05e8), the essential, while secular knowledge is \"''tefel''\" (\u05d8\u05e4\u05dc), secondary or supplementary to Torah. He states that \"[w]e are confident that there is only one truth, and only one body of knowledge that can serve as the standard... Compared to it, all the other sciences are valid only provisionally\".\n\nHis [http://www.aishdas.org/avodah/vol27/v27n149.shtml#01 commentary on] [[Deuteronomy]] [http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/9970 6:7] is perhaps more explicit:\n:\"The study of the Torah shall be our main intellectual pursuit... We are not to study Torah from the standpoint of another science or for the sake of that science. So, too, we are to be careful not to introduce into the sphere of the Torah foreign ideas... Rather, we should always be mindful of the superiority of the Torah, which differs from all other scientific knowledge through its Divine origin... [Our Sages] do not demand of us to completely ignore all the scientific knowledge... [but rather] that a person [be] familiar with these other realms of knowledge, but ... only from the Torah's perspective ... and they warn us that neglecting this perspective will jeopardize our intellectual life.\"\n\n===Neo-Orthodoxy: the \"Breuer\" communities===\nIn 1851, Hirsch was called to become the rabbi of the breakaway Orthodox community of [[Frankfurt am Main]]. This community soon became the model for \"modern communities\" strict in adherence to Orthodox practices, sometimes called, \"Frankfurter Orthodoxy\". Hirsch's son-in-law Rabbi Dr. [[Solomon Breuer|Shlomo Zalman (Solomon) Breuer]], succeeded him after his death. Wary of establishing a dynasty, the Frankfurt community did not appoint Hirsch's son to be his successor.\n\nAfter [[World War I]], in order to show their rejection of religious liberalism, followers of the community started to call themselves \"Neo-Orthodox\"; this mirrored the parallel movement in [[Lutheranism]] (called \"[[Neo-orthodoxy|Neo-Orthodoxy]]\"). Thus, at this point, Hirsch's [[Romanticism|romantic liberalism]] and the values of the [[Revolutions of 1848 in the German states|1848 struggle for civil rights]] were less relevant \u2013 and the rejection of many elements of [[Weimar Republic|Weimar]] [[Weimar culture|German culture]] was prevalent. [[Solomon Breuer]] and [[Isaac Breuer]] were leaders of this conservative turn by the community.<ref>Mordechai Breuer, ''Modernity within Tradition'', chapter 7</ref>\n\nFollowing [[Kristallnacht]], Breuer and his family emigrated to [[Antwerp]], and then to [[New York City]]. Once in New York, Breuer started a congregation among the numerous German refugees in [[Washington Heights, Manhattan|Washington Heights]], which closely followed the customs and mores of the Frankfurt community. The congregation, [[Khal Adath Yeshurun]], is colloquially known as \"Breuer's\". Rabbi [[Shimon Schwab]], also a native of Frankfurt, served as the second Rabbi of the \"Breuer\" community, until his death in 1995. Solomon Breuer and Joseph Breuer are often regarded as Hirsch's intellectual heirs, while Schwab is regarded as aligned with the more traditional [[Lithuania]]n orthodox communities.\n\nThe Breuer community has cautiously applied ''Torah im Derech Eretz'' to [[Culture of the United States|American life]], narrowing its application over time.<ref name=\"Controversial Moments\">In fact, as of 2008 there has been some conflict between leading members of the community as to which direction it should take: see under [[Khal Adath Jeshurun (Washington Heights, Manhattan)]] and [http://www.jewishpress.com/displaycontent_new.cfm?contentid=33512&mode=a&contentname=Controversial_Moments_At_Rav_S._R._Hirsch_Memorial_Celebration Controversial Moments At Rav S.R. Hirsch Memorial Celebration, Article by Elliot Resnick, The Jewish Press, Friday, June 27, 2008, p. 18] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080630202518/http://www.jewishpress.com/displaycontent_new.cfm?contentid=33512&mode=a&contentname=Controversial_Moments_At_Rav_S._R._Hirsch_Memorial_Celebration |date=June 30, 2008 }}</ref> Schwab warned of the dangers of contemporary moral attitudes in secular culture and literature, and emphasized that followers of Neo-Orthodoxy therefore require a strong basis of faith and knowledge, and must exercise caution in engagements with the secular world.\n\nSchwab also frequently emphasized that Torah can never be regarded as parallel with the secular knowledge. \"[[Torah study]] is the highest duty of the Jew\", and \"even to suggest that anything can be parallel to Torah is a blasphemy of the highest order; Torah is above all, and everything else in life must be conducted in accordance with the [[Torah|Written]] and [[Oral law|Oral Torah]].\" Still, entry into commerce or the professions is seen as a valid component of Torah life, to be facilitated by an appropriate secular education (with the caveat that campus life is \"incontestably immoral\"). \"Carrying on one's professional life in consonance with the ''[[halakha]]'' is in itself a practice of Torah.\" One must \"establish the Torah's primacy over the modes of business and professional life so that his behavior transforms even that 'mundane' portion of his life into a sanctification.\"\n\nThe community is positioned ideologically outside of both [[Modern Orthodoxy]] and [[Haredi Judaism]] (\"Ultra-Orthodoxy\"). As regards Haredi Judaism, Schwab acknowledged that although Neo-Orthodoxy is not the path openly espoused by the majority of today's ''[[Rosh yeshiva|Roshei Yeshiva]]'', the \"Torah Only\" and ''Torah Im Derech Eretz'' camps can exist side-by-side. \"As long as one is prompted solely by ''Yiras Shamayim'' (\"fear of Heaven\") and a search for truth, each individual has a choice as to which school he should follow.\" Practically, the community is fully engaged with haredi [[Agudath Yisrael of America]], while it shuns the more modern [[Orthodox Union]].\n\nThe movement is somewhat distant from Modern Orthodoxy. Schwab regards Modern Orthodoxy as having misinterpreted Hirsch's ideas: regarding standards of ''[[halakha]]'' as well as the relative emphasis of Torah versus secular; see discussion under [[Torah Umadda#Neo-Orthodoxy|Torah Umadda]]. Further, Breuer, influenced by Hirsch's philosophy on ''[[Samson Raphael Hirsch#Frankfurt am Main|Austritt]]'' (secession), \"could not countenance recognition of a non-believing body as a legitimate representative of the Jewish people\". For this reason, he was \"unalterably opposed to the ''[[Mizrachi (religious Zionism)|Mizrachi]]'' movement, which remained affiliated with the [[World Zionist Organization]] and the [[Jewish Agency]]\".\n\n===Contemporary influence===\n''Torah im Derech Eretz'' remains influential as a philosophy in [[Orthodox Judaism]]. Although usually associated with the \"[[Joseph Breuer|Breuer]]\" community of [[Washington Heights, Manhattan|Washington Heights]], the philosophy remains an important influence in [[Modern Orthodox Judaism]] and, to some extent, in ''[[Haredi Judaism]]''. (See also [[Divine Providence#Contemporary Orthodox thought|Divine Providence]] for discussion of ''derech eretz'' in contemporary Orthodox Judaism.)\n\n====Modern Orthodoxy====\n''Torah im Derech Eretz'' is a major source of ideology for [[Modern Orthodoxy]], particularly regarding the synthesis of Judaism and secular culture. Organizations on the left of Modern Orthodoxy have embraced the \"broad interpretation\", although critics say that, philosophical issues aside, their \"relatively relaxed stance\" in ''[[halakha]]'' in fact positions them outside the realm of ''Torah im Derech Eretz''.\n\nFurther to the right, the \"broad interpretation\" is largely identical with ''[[Torah Umadda]]''\u2014Torah and secular knowledge\u2014a philosophy of Modern Orthodoxy closely associated with [[Yeshiva University]], which aims at synthesizing Torah learning and secular knowledge within the personality. The two are nevertheless distinct in terms of emphasis. Under ''Torah Umadda'', \"[w]e prefer to look upon science and religion as separate domains...\" ([[Samuel Belkin]], inaugural address, 1943), whereas ''Torah im Derech Eretz'', aims at the domination of Torah over secular knowledge and the application of Torah thought to secular knowledge. See [[Torah Umadda#Neo-Orthodoxy|further]] under ''Torah Umadda''.\n\n====Neo-Orthodoxy====\nAs above, the \"Breuer\" community continues to closely apply the philosophy. However, since [[World War II]], the community, has moved away from the \"median interpretation\" toward the \"narrow interpretation\", as above.<ref name=\"Controversial Moments\"/> Rabbi Breuer saw the risk of misinterpretation of his grandfather's ideas (and confusion with [[Torah Umadda]]) especially post-war. He repeatedly stated that compromising on Jewishness and ''[[halakha]]'' was at variance with ''Torah im Derech Eretz'', and emphasized the distinction between Modern Orthodoxy and Neo-Orthodoxy as regards the relationship between Torah and secular. \"Rabbi Hirsch's fight was not for balance and not for reconcilement, nor for synthesis and certainly not for parallel power, but for domination \u2013 for the true and absolute domination of the divine precept over the new tendencies\" (Isaac Breuer, Hirsch's grandson). See [[Samson Raphael Hirsch#Influence and controversy|further]] in the article on Rabbi Hirsch and [[Modern Orthodox Judaism#Neo-Orthodoxy/Torah Im Derech Eretz|additionally]] under Modern Orthodoxy.\n\n====Haredi Judaism====\n[[Image:Bais-Yaakov-1.jpg|thumb|250px|''Torah im Derech Eretz'' shaped the curriculum of the Beis Yaakov school system. The second graduating class of the Beis Yaakov in Lodz, Poland, in 1934.]]\nToday, the [[Haredi Judaism|Haredi]] \"[[Haredi Judaism#United States|Yeshiva communities]]\" adhere to the \"narrow interpretation\" as an educational philosophy. ''Torah im Derech Eretz'' was the basic idea that shaped the curriculum of the [[Beis Yaakov]] school system, and continues to be influential. (In fact, in her Seminary in [[Krak\u00f3w]], [[Sarah Schenirer]] taught Rav Hirsch's writings in [[German language|German]]. The (German-born) teachers spoke German and the Polish students learned German.<ref>Chevroni, M. ''The Contribution of German Chareidim to the New Yishuv''</ref>) Similarly, the \"narrow interpretation\" guides the curricula at boys' high schools.\n\nOther Haredi communities, the \"Torah only\" school, are further distant from ''Torah im Derech Eretz''. Since [[World War II]] there has been an ideological tendency in that camp to devote all intellectual capabilities to Torah study only\u2014in schools, ''[[yeshiva|yeshivot]]'' and ''[[kollel]]s''. Thus, the optimum course to be adopted in all cases is to devote oneself to full-time Torah learning for as long as possible; \"to go out into the world is a course to be adopted only when there is no other alternative\".<ref>Aryeh Carmell, ''Torah Im Derech Eretz''</ref> Here, the Hirschian model is seen as ''horaat sha'ah'', a \"time specific teaching\" intended to apply to the special circumstances of [[Western Europe]] in the 1800s.<ref>A strong case can actually be made for the idea that the \"Torah only\" is in itself a ''horaat sha'ah'' adopted in the wake of the destruction of the major Torah centers during the Holocaust. ([[Yehuda (Leo) Levi|Levi]] 1990)</ref> (Note that Hirsch himself addressed this contention: \"''Torah im Derech Eretz'' ... is not part of troubled, time bound notions; it represents the ancient, traditional wisdom of our sages that has stood the test everywhere and at all times.\" (''Gesammelte Schriften'' vi p.&nbsp;221); see further under [[Joseph Breuer]].)\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n'''Torah im Derech Eretz'''\n*Berman, Saul J.

His father had inherited (through adoption from his great uncle Sir [[Robert Stewart, 4th Lord of Aubigny|Robert Stewart, 4th Seigneur d'Aubigny]] (c.1470\u20131544)), the French Seigneurie ([[lord of the manor|lordship of the manor]]) of Aubigny and its estates, including the [[Ch\u00e2teau d'Aubigny]] at [[Aubigny-sur-N\u00e8re]] in the ancient [[Provinces of France|province]] of [[Berry, France|Berry]], central France, built by him, also the nearby secondary seat of [[Ch\u00e2teau de la Verrerie (Cher)|Ch\u00e2teau de la Verrerie]].\n\n==Career==\nHe spent much of his life in [[France]] and succeeded his father as  6th Seigneur d'Aubigny in 1567. At the age of 37 he came to Scotland, where he was introduced to his first cousin once removed, the 13-year-old [[James I of England|James VI of Scotland]], when the latter made his formal entry into [[Edinburgh]] and began his personal rule.

He was appointed to the  [[Privy Council of Scotland]], was created [[Earl of Lennox]] on 5 March 1580 (which title having been inherited by King James from his paternal grandfather had merged into the crown), and then [[Duke of Lennox]] on 5 August 1581. He was also created [[Earl of Darnley]], Lords Tarboulton and Dalkeith and received other favours.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=420}} During his rise he was careful to maintain his popularity with the Burgh administrators of Scotland's towns. For example in July 1580 the English diplomat [[Robert Bowes (diplomat)|Robert Bowes]] reported that Lennox had obtained fishing rights in [[Aberdeen]], which the deposed [[James Douglas, 4th Earl of Morton|Regent Morton]] had given to his servant George Affleck of Balmanno, and had then arranged for the King to give this valuable source of income to the town.<ref>''Calendar State Papers Scotland'', vol. 5 (1907), p. 461, no. 536.</ref>\n\nIn [[Presbyterianism|Presbyterian]] Scotland, the thought of a Catholic duke irked many, and Lennox had to make a choice between his Catholic faith and his loyalty to the king. Lennox chose the latter, who taught him the doctrines of [[Calvinism]]. Neverthess the [[Church of Scotland]] remained suspicious of Lennox after his public conversion and took alarm when he had the Earl of Morton tried and beheaded on charges of [[treason]].\n\n==Ruthven Raid and exile==\nIn response the Scottish nobles plotted to oust Lennox. They did so by luring James to [[Huntingtower Castle|Ruthven Castle]] as a guest where they kept him as prisoner for ten months. The Lord Enterprisers then forced James to banish Lennox. A lengthy denunciation of Lennox was issued from [[Stirling Castle]] on 17 September 1582, citing his religion, association with the murderers of [[Henry Stuart, Lord Darnley]] (King James's father) and [[Regent Moray]] and [[Regent Lennox]] and his control over the royal household and international intrigue.<ref>''Calendar of State Papers Scotland'', vol. 6, (1910), 171-174.</ref> Lennox stayed for a while at [[Dumbarton Castle]]. In December whilst travelling south from [[Berwick on Tweed]], by chance near [[Northallerton]] he encountered the French ambassador, M. de la Mothe F\u00e9nelon, who was travelling northward to treat with the [[Raid of Ruthven|Gowrie Regime]]. In London the Scottish poet [[William Fowler (makar)|William Fowler]] pumped him{{cn|date=February 2020|who?}} for information which he sent to [[Francis Walsingham]].<ref>''Calendar of State Papers Scotland'', vol. 6, (1910), 235, 240-3, 256-7, 262-3, 265-6.</ref>\n\n==Return to France==\nLennox returned to France where he started a secret correspondence with King James. He met a frosty reception in France as an [[apostate]]. Although the Scottish nobles believed that they would be proved right in their belief that Lennox's conversion was artificial following his return France, he remained a Presbyterian.\n\n==Death in Paris==\nHe died in Paris on 26 May 1583. His final letter to [[James Stewart, 1st Lord Doune|James Stewart, Lord Doune]], requested him to take care of his son and to recover his former possessions in Scotland for his benefit.<ref>''HMC 6th Report: Earl of Moray'' (London, 1877), p. 637, (Letter dated Paris NS, 4 June 1583).</ref> [[William Schaw]] took his heart back to King James in Scotland, followed by his wife and eldest son Ludovic Stewart. King James had repeatedly vouched for Lennox's religious sincerity and memorialized him in a poem called \"Ane Tragedie of the Phoenix\", which compared him to an exotic bird of unique beauty killed by envy. King James I regarded all Lennox's family with great affection, and instructed his son King Charles I to do well by them. Charles faithfully fulfilled this obligation, and as a result the Lennox family had considerable influence at the Scottish and English Courts over the next two generations.\n\n==Marriage & issue==\nIn about 1572 he married Catherine de Balsac (d.post-1630), a daughter of Guillaume de Balsac, Sieur d'Entragues, by his wife Louise d'Humi\u00e8res. Catherine outlived her husband by many years and  spent her later life at the family estate at Aubigny, where she was entrusted with  the upbringing of her grandchildren.

His father had inherited (through adoption from his great uncle Sir [[Robert Stewart, 4th Lord of Aubigny|Robert Stewart, 4th Seigneur d'Aubigny]] (c.1470\u20131544)), the French Seigneurie ([[lord of the manor|lordship of the manor]]) of Aubigny and its estates, including the [[Ch\u00e2teau d'Aubigny]] at [[Aubigny-sur-N\u00e8re]] in the ancient [[Provinces of France|province]] of [[Berry, France|Berry]], central France, built by him, also the nearby secondary seat of [[Ch\u00e2teau de la Verrerie (Cher)|Ch\u00e2teau de la Verrerie]].\n\n==Career==\nHe spent much of his life in [[France]] and succeeded his father as  6th Seigneur d'Aubigny in 1567. At the age of 37 he came to Scotland, where he was introduced to his first cousin once removed, the 13-year-old [[James I of England|James VI of Scotland]], when the latter made his formal entry into [[Edinburgh]] and began his personal rule. Esm\u00e9 was an exotic visitor who fascinated the young James,<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=zC74dutk7bQC&pg=PT860&lpg=PT860&dq=Esm%C3%A9+Stewart,+1st+Duke+of+Lennox&source=bl&ots=hVTx8NgqWk&sig=RqKlMtz19SgFG1CCa-gWtPuh_Dw&hl=en&sa=X&ei=TwyRU9bIEcWcyAScuYCYDQ&ved=0CCsQ6AEwAjgU#v=onepage&q=Esm%C3%A9%20Stewart%2C%201st%20Duke%20of%20Lennox&f=false ''A Dictionary of British History'', ed.

He was appointed to the  [[Privy Council of Scotland]], was created [[Earl of Lennox]] on 5 March 1580 (which title having been inherited by King James from his paternal grandfather had merged into the crown), and then [[Duke of Lennox]] on 5 August 1581. He was also created [[Earl of Darnley]], Lords Tarboulton and Dalkeith and received other favours.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=420}} During his rise he was careful to maintain his popularity with the Burgh administrators of Scotland's towns. For example in July 1580 the English diplomat [[Robert Bowes (diplomat)|Robert Bowes]] reported that Lennox had obtained fishing rights in [[Aberdeen]], which the deposed [[James Douglas, 4th Earl of Morton|Regent Morton]] had given to his servant George Affleck of Balmanno, and had then arranged for the King to give this valuable source of income to the town.<ref>''Calendar State Papers Scotland'', vol. 5 (1907), p. 461, no. 536.</ref>\n\nIn [[Presbyterianism|Presbyterian]] Scotland, the thought of a Catholic duke irked many, and Lennox had to make a choice between his Catholic faith and his loyalty to the king. Lennox chose the latter, who taught him the doctrines of [[Calvinism]]. Neverthess the [[Church of Scotland]] remained suspicious of Lennox after his public conversion and took alarm when he had the Earl of Morton tried and beheaded on charges of [[treason]].\n\n==Ruthven Raid and exile==\nIn response the Scottish nobles plotted to oust Lennox. They did so by luring James to [[Huntingtower Castle|Ruthven Castle]] as a guest where they kept him as prisoner for ten months. The Lord Enterprisers then forced James to banish Lennox. A lengthy denunciation of Lennox was issued from [[Stirling Castle]] on 17 September 1582, citing his religion, association with the murderers of [[Henry Stuart, Lord Darnley]] (King James's father) and [[Regent Moray]] and [[Regent Lennox]] and his control over the royal household and international intrigue.<ref>''Calendar of State Papers Scotland'', vol. 6, (1910), 171-174.</ref> Lennox stayed for a while at [[Dumbarton Castle]]. In December whilst travelling south from [[Berwick on Tweed]], by chance near [[Northallerton]] he encountered the French ambassador, M. de la Mothe F\u00e9nelon, who was travelling northward to treat with the [[Raid of Ruthven|Gowrie Regime]]. In London the Scottish poet [[William Fowler (makar)|William Fowler]] pumped him{{cn|date=February 2020|who?}} for information which he sent to [[Francis Walsingham]].<ref>''Calendar of State Papers Scotland'', vol. 6, (1910), 235, 240-3, 256-7, 262-3, 265-6.</ref>\n\n==Return to France==\nLennox returned to France where he started a secret correspondence with King James. He met a frosty reception in France as an [[apostate]]. Although the Scottish nobles believed that they would be proved right in their belief that Lennox's conversion was artificial following his return France, he remained a Presbyterian.\n\n==Death in Paris==\nHe died in Paris on 26 May 1583. His final letter to [[James Stewart, 1st Lord Doune|James Stewart, Lord Doune]], requested him to take care of his son and to recover his former possessions in Scotland for his benefit.<ref>''HMC 6th Report: Earl of Moray'' (LOndon, 1877), p. 637, (Letter dated Paris NS, 4 June 1583).</ref> [[William Schaw]] took his heart back to King James in Scotland, followed by his wife and eldest son Ludovic Stewart. King James had repeatedly vouched for Lennox's religious sincerity and memorialized him in a poem called \"Ane Tragedie of the Phoenix\", which compared him to an exotic bird of unique beauty killed by envy. King James I regarded all Lennox's family with great affection, and instructed his son King Charles I to do well by them. Charles faithfully fulfilled this obligation, and as a result the Lennox family had considerable influence at the Scottish and English Courts over the next two generations.\n\n==Marriage & issue==\nIn about 1572 he married Catherine de Balsac (d.post-1630), a daughter of Guillaume de Balsac, Sieur d'Entragues, by his wife Louise d'Humi\u00e8res. Catherine outlived her husband by many years and  spent her later life at the family estate at Aubigny, where she was entrusted with  the upbringing of her grandchildren.

They were noted flint-workers and evidence of their skill in crafting arrowheads is still to be found in open worked field areas surrounding the village. The next wave of inhabitants were the [[Neutral Nation|Attawandaron]] nation, the Neutrals, who occupied the region from about 1350 until their absorption by the [[Iroquois]] in the year 1651. The last significant native nation to occupy the area was the [[Mississaugas]].\n\nIn 1670, French missionaries [[Fran\u00e7ois Dollier de Casson]] and [[Ren\u00e9 Br\u00e9hant de Galin\u00e9e]] became the first Europeans to winter at what is now Port Dover.
