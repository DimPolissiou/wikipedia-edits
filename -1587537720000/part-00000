Despite the warnings she received about the house being haunted, having no other place to go, she decides to move there anyway. Upon her arrival she discovers that the house is occupied illegally by three handsome young men: Aoi, Yukari and Ise. The three immediately warn the unaware Himari that she must leave the house as soon as possible, using the story of the ghosts and curses as well, but she does not give up. Soon, she discovers that it is all true: her home appears to be on the border between the human and the spirit worlds, and she was destined to be the guardian between the two, but her role is already taken by Aoi.\n\n==Characters==\n;{{Nihongo|Himari Momochi|\u767e\u5343 \u3072\u307e\u308a|Momochi Himari}}\n:It has been stated in the manga that Himari's parents passed away, most likely when she was very young and has been an orphan ever since. It is unclear if she has any siblings before the incident or how her parents passed on. By having the blood of the Momochi family running in her veins, she is supposed to be the next Omamori-sama or, 'Nue', the guardian of the Momochi House when she receives the will of her family when she turns 16. This would make her the guardian of the Momochi House which is located on the border of the human and spirit world, which would fall under the guardian's protection and monitoring, However, that role has been taken by Aoi and now, she only holds the power to expel anyone from the house if she wishes hard enough due to her bloodline.\n;{{Nihongo|Aoi Nanamori|\u4e03\u5b88 \u8475|Nanamori Aoi}}\n:He is human, but he became the Omamori-sama at the age of 10 while trying to run away from something, he broke the seal and entered in the Momochi house, this forced him to become its guardian. The house has erased all the traces of his existence in the human world, which is why it seems that neither his family nor friends remember him. In the [[Nue]] form, he is a spirit with cat ears, bird feathers and foxtail.\n;{{Nihongo|Yukari|\u7d2b}}\n:He is Aoi's first [[shikigami]], a serving spirit, in his demonic form he has the appearance of a [[Mizuchi]], a water snake. In his past life he was human, wrongly accused of being a demon, given as a sacrifice to the dragon god Ryujin, the god took pity on him and allowed him to be reborn as an [[Ayakashi (y\u014dkai)|Ayakashi]] of his own species. He is very kind and does all the houseworks.\n;{{Nihongo|Ise|\u4f0a\u52e2}}\n:He is Aoi's second shikigami, in his demonic form he has the appearance of a [[Sh\u014dj\u014d]], an orangutan. He is the youngest of his species, for breaking the law by releasing his powers to the human world, the elders of his tribe fitted him with a cursed collar and warned him if he broke the law again, the curse would destroy his body. In order to save a friend, he ended up breaking the law so Aoi made Ise his shikigami to dissolve the curse and save him. Before arriving at the Momochi house, he enjoyed observing humans and sometimes playing pranks on them. Unlike Yukari, he is very grumpy.\n;{{Nihongo|Hakka|\u516b\u6e26}}\n:He is a gatekeeper in the spirit realm, he aspired to become the new Omamori-sama, but the Nue, to keep him at bay, forced him to become one of his shikigami. He too, in his past life, was human.\n;{{Nihongo|Kasha|\u706b\u8eca}}\n:A powerful Ayakashi, he has a deep obsession towards the Nue, and is his biggest rival. To fight boredom, he enjoys annoying the members of the Momochi household, and his arrival usually announces big troubles.\n;{{Nihongo|Hidaka Hayato|\u65e5\u9ad8 \u96bc}}\n:A childhood friend of Aoi who still has some fragments of his memories with him. He is the descendant of a family that had the power to control the [[Kuda-gitsune]], a fox-like spirit, although he demonstrated that he did not inherit this ability, he still has some connection with the spirit world.\n==Release==\n{{Graphic novel list/header\n | Language = Japan\n | SecondLanguage = North America\n}}\n{{Graphic novel list\n | VolumeNumber = 1\n | OriginalRelDate = July 23, 2013<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.kadokawa.co.jp/product/321303000163/|script-title=ja:\u767e\u5343\u3055\u3093\u5bb6\u306e\u3042\u3084\u304b\u3057\u738b\u5b50\u3000\u7b2c\uff11\u5dfb|publisher=[[Kadokawa Corporation]]|accessdate=May 13, 2019|language=Japanese}}</ref>\n | OriginalISBN = 978-40-4120-810-6\n | LicensedRelDate = July 7, 2015<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.viz.com/read/manga/demon-prince-of-momochi-house-volume-1/product/3706|title=The Demon Prince of Momochi House, Vol. 1|publisher=[[Viz Media]]|accessdate=May 13, 2019}}</ref>\n | LicensedISBN = 978-1-4215-7962-7\n | ChapterListCol1 =\n* 01. {{nihongo|\"The Mysterious Residents of Momochi House\"|\u767e\u5343\u3055\u3093\u5bb6\u306e\u3042\u3084\u3057\u3044\u4eba\u3005|Momochi-san Chi no Ayashii Hitobito}}\n* 02. {{nihongo|\"Himari Becomes a Landlady\"|\u3072\u307e\u308a\u3001\u5bb6\u4e3b\u306b\u306a\u308b\u3002|Himari, Yanushi ni Naru.}}\n | ChapterListCol2 =\n* 03. {{nihongo|\"Falling Cherry Blossoms Stir Up a Storm of Love?!\"|\u685c\u5439\u96ea\u306f\u604b\u306e\u5d50\uff01\uff1f|Sakurafubuki wa Koi no Arashi!?}}\n | VolumeExtras = \n | Summary = \n}}\n{{Graphic novel list\n | VolumeNumber = 2\n | OriginalRelDate = November 26, 2013<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.kadokawa.co.jp/product/321306000041/|script-title=ja:\u767e\u5343\u3055\u3093\u5bb6\u306e\u3042\u3084\u304b\u3057\u738b\u5b50\u3000\u7b2c\uff12\u5dfb|publisher=[[Kadokawa Corporation]]|accessdate=May 13, 2019|language=Japanese}}</ref>\n | OriginalISBN = 978-40-4120-893-9\n | LicensedRelDate = October 6, 2015<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.viz.com/read/manga/demon-prince-of-momochi-house-volume-2/product/3705|title=The Demon Prince of Momochi House, Vol. 2|publisher=[[Viz Media]]|accessdate=May 13, 2019}}</ref>\n | LicensedISBN = 978-1-4215-7963-4\n | ChapterListCol1 =\n* 04. {{nihongo|\"Mystery House\"|\u30de\u30e8\u30a4\u30ac|Mayoiga}}\n* 05. {{nihongo|\"A Formidable New Shikigami?!\"|\u30a2\u30a4\u30c4\u306f\u3066\u3054\u308f\u3044\u65b0\u5f0f\u795e\uff01\uff1f|Aitsu wa Tegowai Shin-shikigami!?}}\n* 06. {{nihongo|\"Underwater Momochi House\"|\u6c34\u306e\u5e95\u306e\u767e\u5343\u5bb6|Mizu no Soko no Momochi Chi}}\n | ChapterListCol2 =\n* 07. {{nihongo|\"The Fourth Friend: Part 1\"|\u56db\u4eba\u76ee\u306e\u53cb\u9054-\u524d-|Yonin-me no Tomodachi: Zen}}\n* Bonus Story. {{nihongo|\"You May Enter\"|\u901a\u308a\u3084\u3093\u305b|T\u014dri-yan se}}\n | VolumeExtras = \n | Summary = \n}}\n{{Graphic novel list\n | VolumeNumber = 3\n | OriginalRelDate = February 26, 2014<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.kadokawa.co.jp/product/321308000035/|script-title=ja:\u767e\u5343\u3055\u3093\u5bb6\u306e\u3042\u3084\u304b\u3057\u738b\u5b50\u3000\u7b2c\uff13\u5dfb|publisher=[[Kadokawa Corporation]]|accessdate=May 13, 2019|language=Japanese}}</ref>\n | OriginalISBN = 978-40-4121-026-0\n | LicensedRelDate = January 5, 2016<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.viz.com/read/manga/demon-prince-of-momochi-house-volume-3/product/3704|title=The Demon Prince of Momochi House, Vol. 3|publisher=[[Viz Media]]|accessdate=May 13, 2019}}</ref>\n | LicensedISBN = 978-1-4215-7964-1\n | ChapterListCol1 =\n* 08. {{nihongo|\"The Fourth Friend: Part 2\"|\u56db\u4eba\u76ee\u306e\u53cb\u9054-\u5f8c-|Yonin-me no Tomodachi: K\u014d}}\n* 09. {{nihongo|\"The Crimson Flames Burning in Darkness\"|\u95c7\u306b\u71c3\u3048\u3057\u7d05\u306e|Yami no Moeshi Aka no}}\n | ChapterListCol2 =\n* 10. {{nihongo|\"Dream or Illusion?!

Despite the warnings she received about the house being haunted, having no other place to go, she decides to move there anyway. Upon her arrival she discovers that the house is occupied illegally by three handsome young men: Aoi, Yukari and Ise. The three immediately warn the unaware Himari that she must leave the house as soon as possible, using the story of the ghosts and curses as well, but she does not give up. Soon, she discovers that it is all true: her home appears to be on the border between the human and the spirit worlds, and she was destined to be the guardian between the two, but her role is already taken by Aoi.\n\n==Characters==\n;{{Nihongo|Himari Momochi|\u767e\u5343 \u3072\u307e\u308a|Momochi Himari}}\n:It has been stated in the manga that Himari's parents passed away, most likely when she was very young and has been an orphan ever since. It is unclear if she has any siblings before the incident or how her parents passed on. By having the blood of the Momochi family running in her veins, she is supposed to be the next Omamori-sama or, 'Nue', the guardian of the Momochi House when she receives the will of her family when she turns 16. This would make her the guardian of the Momochi House which is located on the border of the human and spirit world, which would fall under the guardian's protection and monitoring, However, that role has been taken by Aoi and now, she only holds the power to expel anyone from the house if she wishes hard enough due to her bloodline.\n;{{Nihongo|Aoi Nanamori|\u4e03\u5b88 \u8475|Nanamori Aoi}}\n:He is human, but he became the Omamori-sama at the age of 10 while trying to run away from something, he broke the seal and entered in the Momochi house, this forced him to become its guardian. The house has erased all the traces of his existence in the human world, which is why it seems that neither his family nor friends remember him. In the [[Nue]] form, he is a spirit with cat ears, bird feathers and foxtail.\n;{{Nihongo|Yukari|\u7d2b}}\n:He is Aoi's first [[shikigami]], a serving spirit, in his demonic form he has the appearance of a [[Mizuchi]], a water snake. In his past life he was human, wrongly accused of being a demon, given as a sacrifice to the dragon god Ryujin, the god took pity on him and allowed him to be reborn as an [[Ayakashi (y\u014dkai)|Ayakashi]] of his own species. He is very kind and does all the houseworks.\n;{{Nihongo|Ise|\u4f0a\u52e2}}\n:He is Aoi's second shikigami, in his demonic form he has the appearance of a [[Sh\u014dj\u014d]], an orangutan. He is the youngest of his species, for breaking the law by releasing his powers to the human world, the elders of his tribe fitted him with a cursed collar and warned him if he broke the law again, the curse would destroy his body. In order to save a friend, he ended up breaking the law so Aoi made Ise his shikigami to dissolve the curse and save him. Before arriving at the Momochi house, he enjoyed observing humans and sometimes playing pranks on them. Unlike Yukari, he is very grumpy.\n;{{Nihongo|Hakka|\u516b\u6e26}}\n:He is a gatekeeper in the spirit realm, he aspired to become the new Omamori-sama, but the Nue, to keep him at bay, forced him to become one of his shikigami. He too, in his past life, was human.\n;{{Nihongo|Kasha|\u706b\u8eca}}\n:A powerful Ayakashi, he has a deep obsession towards the Nue, and is his biggest rival. To fight boredom, he enjoys annoying the members of the Momochi household, and his arrival usually announces big troubles.\n;{{Nihongo|Hidaka Hayato|\u65e5\u9ad8 \u96bc}}\n:A childhood friend of Aoi who still has some fragments of his memories with him. He is the descendant of a family that had the power to control the [[Kuda-gitsune]], a fox-like spirit, although he demonstrated that he did not inherit this ability, he still has some connection with the spirit world.\n==Release==\n{{Graphic novel list/header\n | Language = Japan\n | SecondLanguage = North America\n}}\n{{Graphic novel list\n | VolumeNumber = 1\n | OriginalRelDate = July 23, 2013<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.kadokawa.co.jp/product/321303000163/|script-title=ja:\u767e\u5343\u3055\u3093\u5bb6\u306e\u3042\u3084\u304b\u3057\u738b\u5b50\u3000\u7b2c\uff11\u5dfb|publisher=[[Kadokawa Corporation]]|accessdate=May 13, 2019|language=Japanese}}</ref>\n | OriginalISBN = 978-40-4120-810-6\n | LicensedRelDate = July 7, 2015<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.viz.com/read/manga/demon-prince-of-momochi-house-volume-1/product/3706|title=The Demon Prince of Momochi House, Vol. 1|publisher=[[Viz Media]]|accessdate=May 13, 2019}}</ref>\n | LicensedISBN = 978-1-4215-7962-7\n | ChapterListCol1 =\n* 01. {{nihongo|\"The Mysterious Residents of Momochi House\"|\u767e\u5343\u3055\u3093\u5bb6\u306e\u3042\u3084\u3057\u3044\u4eba\u3005|Momochi-san Chi no Ayashii Hitobito}}\n* 02. {{nihongo|\"Himari Becomes a Landlady\"|\u3072\u307e\u308a\u3001\u5bb6\u4e3b\u306b\u306a\u308b\u3002|Himari, Yanushi ni Naru.}}\n | ChapterListCol2 =\n* 03. {{nihongo|\"Falling Cherry Blossoms Stir Up a Storm of Love?!\"|\u685c\u5439\u96ea\u306f\u604b\u306e\u5d50\uff01\uff1f|Sakurafubuki wa Koi no Arashi!?}}\n | VolumeExtras = \n | Summary = \n}}\n{{Graphic novel list\n | VolumeNumber = 2\n | OriginalRelDate = November 26, 2013<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.kadokawa.co.jp/product/321306000041/|script-title=ja:\u767e\u5343\u3055\u3093\u5bb6\u306e\u3042\u3084\u304b\u3057\u738b\u5b50\u3000\u7b2c\uff12\u5dfb|publisher=[[Kadokawa Corporation]]|accessdate=May 13, 2019|language=Japanese}}</ref>\n | OriginalISBN = 978-40-4120-893-9\n | LicensedRelDate = October 6, 2015<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.viz.com/read/manga/demon-prince-of-momochi-house-volume-2/product/3705|title=The Demon Prince of Momochi House, Vol. 2|publisher=[[Viz Media]]|accessdate=May 13, 2019}}</ref>\n | LicensedISBN = 978-1-4215-7963-4\n | ChapterListCol1 =\n* 04. {{nihongo|\"Mystery House\"|\u30de\u30e8\u30a4\u30ac|Mayoiga}}\n* 05. {{nihongo|\"A Formidable New Shikigami?!\"|\u30a2\u30a4\u30c4\u306f\u3066\u3054\u308f\u3044\u65b0\u5f0f\u795e\uff01\uff1f|Aitsu wa Tegowai Shin-shikigami!?}}\n* 06. {{nihongo|\"Underwater Momochi House\"|\u6c34\u306e\u5e95\u306e\u767e\u5343\u5bb6|Mizu no Soko no Momochi Chi}}\n | ChapterListCol2 =\n* 07. {{nihongo|\"The Fourth Friend: Part 1\"|\u56db\u4eba\u76ee\u306e\u53cb\u9054-\u524d-|Yonin-me no Tomodachi: Zen}}\n* Bonus Story. {{nihongo|\"You May Enter\"|\u901a\u308a\u3084\u3093\u305b|T\u014dri-yan se}}\n | VolumeExtras = \n | Summary = \n}}\n{{Graphic novel list\n | VolumeNumber = 3\n | OriginalRelDate = February 26, 2014<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.kadokawa.co.jp/product/321308000035/|script-title=ja:\u767e\u5343\u3055\u3093\u5bb6\u306e\u3042\u3084\u304b\u3057\u738b\u5b50\u3000\u7b2c\uff13\u5dfb|publisher=[[Kadokawa Corporation]]|accessdate=May 13, 2019|language=Japanese}}</ref>\n | OriginalISBN = 978-40-4121-026-0\n | LicensedRelDate = January 5, 2016<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.viz.com/read/manga/demon-prince-of-momochi-house-volume-3/product/3704|title=The Demon Prince of Momochi House, Vol. 3|publisher=[[Viz Media]]|accessdate=May 13, 2019}}</ref>\n | LicensedISBN = 978-1-4215-7964-1\n | ChapterListCol1 =\n* 08. {{nihongo|\"The Fourth Friend: Part 2\"|\u56db\u4eba\u76ee\u306e\u53cb\u9054-\u5f8c-|Yonin-me no Tomodachi: K\u014d}}\n* 09. {{nihongo|\"The Crimson Flames Burning in Darkness\"|\u95c7\u306b\u71c3\u3048\u3057\u7d05\u306e|Yami no Moeshi Aka no}}\n | ChapterListCol2 =\n* 10. {{nihongo|\"Dream or Illusion?!

W. Bush]] was an incumbent vice president at the time of the [[1988 United States presidential election|1988]] and [[Al Gore]] was an incumbent vice president at the time of the [[2000 United States presidential election|2000]] elections).\n\n==Background==\n===Procedure===\n{{further|United States presidential election#Procedure}}\n\n[[Article Two of the United States Constitution|Article Two]] of the [[United States Constitution]] states that for a person to serve as president the individual must be a [[Natural-born-citizen clause|natural-born citizen of the United States]], at least 35 years old and a United States resident for at least 14 years. Candidates for the presidency typically seek the nomination of one of the [[List of political parties in the United States|various political parties]] of the United States, in which case each party develops a method (such as a [[primary election]]) to choose the candidate the party deems best suited to run for the position. The primary elections are usually [[indirect election]]s where voters cast ballots for a slate of party delegates pledged to a particular candidate. The party's delegates then officially nominate a candidate to run on the party's behalf. The presidential nominee typically chooses a vice presidential [[running mate]] to form that party's [[Ticket (election)|ticket]], who is then ratified by the delegates (with the exception of the [[Libertarian Party (United States)|Libertarian Party]], which nominates its vice presidential candidate by delegate vote regardless of the presidential nominee's preference). The general election in November is also an indirect election, in which voters cast ballots for a slate of members of the [[Electoral College (United States)|Electoral College]]; these electors then directly elect the president and vice president.<ref name=\"rQNzf\" /> If [[contingent election|no candidate receives the minimum 270 electoral votes needed to win the election]], the [[United States House of Representatives]] will select the president from the three candidates who received the most electoral votes, and the [[United States Senate]] will select the vice president from the candidates who received the two highest totals.\n\nOn August 26, 2019, the [[Maine legislature]] passed a bill adopting [[ranked-choice voting in the United States|ranked-choice voting]] both for presidential primaries and for the general election.<ref name=\"ovz9x\" /><ref name=\"qhJpi\" /> On September 6, 2019, Governor [[Janet Mills]] allowed the bill to become law without her signature, which delayed it from taking effect until after the [[2020 Maine Democratic primary|2020 Democratic primary]] in March, but puts Maine on track to be the first state to use ranked-choice voting for a presidential general election. The law continues the use of the [[United States Electoral College#Congressional district method|congressional district method]] for the allocation of electors, as [[Maine]] and [[Nebraska]] have used in recent elections.<ref name=\"FcJYG\" /> The change could potentially delay the projection of the winner(s) of Maine's electoral votes for days after election day,<ref name=\"h81aa\" /> and will also complicate interpretation of the national [[direct election|popular vote]].<ref name=\"TijwC\" />\n\nThe [[Twenty-second Amendment to the United States Constitution|Twenty-second Amendment]] to the [[United States Constitution|Constitution]] states that an individual cannot be elected to the presidency more than twice. This prohibits former presidents [[Bill Clinton]], [[George W. Bush]], and [[Barack Obama]] from being elected president again. Former president [[Jimmy Carter]], having served only a single term as president, is not constitutionally prohibited from being elected to another term in the 2020 election, though he has no plans to do so, saying, \"95 is out of the question. I'm having a hard time walking. I think the time has passed for me to be involved actively in politics, much less run for president.\"<ref name=\"WJoNg\" />\n\n===Demographic trends===\n{{further|Demography of the United States}}\n\nThe age group of what will then be people in the 18-to-45-year-old bracket is expected to represent just under 40 percent of the United States' eligible voters in 2020. It is expected that more than 30 percent of eligible American voters will be [[Person of color|nonwhite]].<ref name=\"JbYBK\" />\n\nA bipartisan report indicates that changes in voter demographics since the [[2016 United States presidential election#Voter demographics|2016 election]] could impact the results of the 2020 election. [[African Americans]], [[Hispanic]]s, [[Asian people|Asians]], and other ethnic minorities, as well as \"whites with a college degree\", are expected to all increase their percentage of national eligible voters by 2020, while \"whites without a college degree\" will decrease. Generation Z, those born after 1996, will more than double to 10% of the eligible voters.<ref name=\"4vRND\" />\nTraditionally, all these shifts were thought to potentially be an advantage for the Democratic nominee as they all have historically voted substantially more for Democrats than Republicans and continue to, however; that rate at which these groups, especially Generation Z, vote for Democrats is decreasing, with non-whites<ref name=\"JnDmH\" /> and young voters<ref name=\"QXhgH\" /> both voting for and supporting Republicans at higher rates than before 2016.  However, this is counteracted by whites and 65+ voters both voting for and supporting Democrats at a higher rate.  These shifts have been slight overall nationally but substantially larger in swing states such as Wisconsin, Michigan and Iowa.<ref name=\"KB6cE\" /><ref name=\"c69Oy\" /><ref name=\"YirDI\" /><ref name=\"rBwrM\" /> These shifts tend to occur more geographically favorably for Republicans than Democrats<ref name=\"WOT96\" />, thus; it is possible Trump could win the [[Electoral College (United States)|Electoral College]] while still losing the popular vote, possibly by an even larger margin than in 2016.<ref name=\"6EgES\" />\n\n===Simultaneous elections===\n{{further|2020 United States Senate elections|2020 United States House of Representatives elections}}\n\nThe presidential election will occur simultaneously with elections to the [[2020 United States Senate elections|Senate]] and the [[2020 United States House of Representatives elections|House of Representatives]]. Gubernatorial and legislative elections will also be held in several states. Following the election, the United States House will redistribute the seats among the 50 states based on the results of the [[2020 United States Census]], and the states will conduct a [[United States redistricting, 2022|redistricting]] of Congressional and state legislative districts. In most states the governor and the state legislature conduct the redistricting (although some states have [[redistricting commission]]s), and often a party that wins a presidential election experiences a [[coattail effect]] which also helps other candidates of that party win elections.<ref name=\"9qYs9\" /> Therefore, the party that wins the 2020 presidential election could also win a [[gerrymandering|significant advantage]] in the drawing of new Congressional and state legislative districts that would stay in effect until the 2032 elections.<ref name=\"X02Fz\" />\n\n===Impeachment===\nThe House of Representatives [[Impeachment of Donald Trump|voted to impeach President Trump]] on two counts on December 18, 2019.<ref name=\"OB3KB\" /> The trial in the Senate began on January 21, 2020,<ref name=\"IIWDj\" /> and ended on February 5, resulting in [[Acquittal#United States|acquittal]] by the [[United States Senate]].<ref name=\"yUc9u\" />\n\nThis is the first time a president has been impeached during his first term and while running for a second term.<ref name=\"J17gD\" /> Trump continued to hold campaign rallies during the impeachment.<ref name=\"FVJtv\" /><ref name=\"GGhFA\" /> This is also the first time since the modern presidential primaries were established in 1911 that a president has been subjected to impeachment while the primary season was underway.<ref name=\"Politiconov1\" /> The impeachment process overlapped with the primary campaigns, forcing senators running for the Democratic nomination to remain in Washington for the trial in the days before and after the Iowa caucuses.<ref name=\"2cIKK\" /><ref name=\"JDGyw\" />\n\n===Effects of the 2020 coronavirus pandemic===\n[[File:Electionsaltered.svg|thumb|right|States with at least one local, state, or federal primary election date or method of voting altered as of March 29, 2020. \n{{legend|#eeff00|Municipal election date altered |border=0}}\n{{legend|#0cff00|State level primary or election date altered |border=0}}\n{{legend|#1500ff|State level and municipal primary or election date altered |border=0}}\n{{legend|#b200ff|Federal level primary or election date altered |border=0}}]]\n{{see|2020 coronavirus pandemic in the United States}}\n{{see|Impact of the 2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic on politics}}\n\nSeveral events related to the 2020 presidential election have been altered or postponed due to the ongoing [[2020 coronavirus pandemic in the United States|coronavirus pandemic]].

The last time this did not occur was the nomination of [[Adlai Stevenson II]] at the [[1952 Democratic National Convention]].<ref name=\"ssKcA\" /> Meanwhile, six states will use [[Ranked-choice voting in the United States|ranked-choice voting]] in the primaries: Alaska, Hawaii, Kansas, and Wyoming for all voters; and Iowa and Nevada for absentee voters.<ref name=\"7VCs8\" />\n\nAfter [[Hillary Clinton]]'s loss in the [[2016 United States presidential election|previous]] election, the Democratic Party was seen largely as leaderless<ref name=\"BGA13\" /> and fractured between the [[centrist]] Clinton wing and the more [[Progressivism in the United States|progressive]] [[Bernie Sanders|Sanders]] wing of the party, echoing the rift brought up in the [[Democratic Party presidential primaries, 2016|2016 primary]] election.<ref name=\"YGlMQ\" /><ref name=\"le0En\" />\n\nThis divide between the establishment and progressive wings of the party has been reflected in several elections leading up to the 2020 primaries, most notably in 2017 with the election for [[Democratic National Committee chairmanship election, 2017|DNC chair]] between moderate-backed [[Tom Perez]] and progressive-backed [[Keith Ellison]]:<ref name=\"rrgRf\" /> Perez was elected chairman, and Ellison was appointed the [[Deputy Chair of the Democratic National Committee|deputy chair]], a largely ceremonial role. In 2018, several [[U.S. House]] districts that Democrats hoped to gain from the Republican majority had contentious primary elections. These clashes were described by ''[[Politico]]''{{'}}s Elena Schneider as a \"Democratic civil war\".<ref name=\"rlKMJ\" /> Meanwhile, there has been a general shift to the left in regards to college tuition, healthcare, and immigration among Democrats in the Senate, likely to build up credentials for the upcoming primary election.<ref name=\"gTbzW\" /><ref name=\"C7O7F\" />\n\nOverall, the 2020 primary field had 29 major candidates,<ref name=\"fkBz3\" /> breaking the record for the largest field under the modern presidential primary system previously set during the [[2016 Republican Party presidential primaries|2016 GOP primaries]] with 17 major candidates.<ref name=\"politifact2019\" /> Several female candidates entered the race, increasing the likelihood of the Democrats nominating a woman for the second time in a row.<ref name=\"IuwYR\" />\n\nEntering the [[2020 Iowa Democratic caucuses|Iowa caucuses]] on February 3, 2020, however, the field had decreased to 11 major candidates. [[Pete Buttigieg]] narrowly defeated [[Bernie Sanders]] in Iowa, then Sanders edged Buttigieg in the February 11 [[2020 New Hampshire Democratic primary|New Hampshire primary]]. Following [[Michael Bennet]], [[Deval Patrick]], and [[Andrew Yang]] dropping out, Sanders won the [[2020 Nevada Democratic caucuses|Nevada caucuses]] on February 22. [[Joe Biden]] then won the [[2020 South Carolina Democratic primary|South Carolina primary]], causing Buttigieg, [[Amy Klobuchar]], and [[Tom Steyer]] to abandon their campaigns (Buttigieg and Klobuchar then immediately endorsed Biden). After [[Super Tuesday]], March 3, [[Michael Bloomberg]] and [[Elizabeth Warren]] quit the race, leaving three candidates left: Biden and Sanders, the main contenders, and [[Tulsi Gabbard]], who remained in the race despite facing nigh-on insurmountable odds.<ref name=\"cw3Ne\" /> Gabbard then dropped out and endorsed Biden after the March 17 [[2020 Arizona Democratic primary|Arizona]], [[2020 Florida Democratic primary|Florida]], and [[2020 Illinois Democratic primary|Illinois]] races.<ref name=\"2vZj6\" /> On April 8, 2020, Sanders dropped out, reportedly after being convinced by Obama, leaving Biden as the only major candidate remaining, and the presumptive nominee.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.politico.com/news/2020/04/08/biden-sanders-2016-2020-176169|title=Biden moves quickly to exorcise \u2018the ghosts of 2016\u2019|website=Politico|last1=Caputo|first1=Marc|date=April 8, 2020|accessdate=April 8, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Kenton |first1=Luke |title=Obama convinced Bernie Sanders to drop out of Democratic primary |url=https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8220051/Barack-Obama-reportedly-convinced-Bernie-Sanders-drop-Democratic-primary.html |website=Mail Online |accessdate=April 22, 2020 |date=15 April 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Collman |first1=Ashley |title=Obama convinced Bernie Sanders to drop out by arguing that he already succeeded in pushing Biden to the left, new report says, Business Insider - Business Insider Singapore |url=https://www.businessinsider.sg/obama-convinced-bernie-sanders-to-drop-out-2020-race-2020-4?r=US&IR=T |website=www.businessinsider.sg |publisher=Business Insider |accessdate=April 22, 2020}}</ref> Biden then gained endorsements from Obama, Sanders and Warren, respectively.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Fearnow |first1=Benjamin |title=Joe Biden's favorability rose 9 percent after endorsements from Obama, Sanders and Warren |url=https://www.newsweek.com/joe-bidens-favorability-rose-9-percent-after-endorsements-obama-sanders-warren-1499200 |website=Newsweek |publisher=Newsweek |accessdate=April 22, 2020 |language=en |date=21 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n====Presumptive nominee==== \n{{Joe Biden series}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:90%; text-align:center;\"\n|-\n| colspan=\"30\" style=\"background:#f1f1f1;\" |[[File:U.S. Democratic Party logo (transparent).svg|65px|center|link=Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party (United States)]]<big>'''Presumptive 2020 Democratic Party ticket'''</big>\n|-\n! style=\"width:3em; font-size:135%; background:{{Democratic Party (United States)/meta/color}}; width:200px;\"|{{colored link|white|Joe Biden}}\n! style=\"width:3em; font-size:135%; background:{{Democratic Party (United States)/meta/color}};\"|{{colored link|white|2020 Democratic Party vice presidential candidate selection|TBD}}\n|- style=\"color:#000; font-size:100%; background:#c8ebff;\"\n| style=\"width:3em; width:200px;\"|'''''for President'''''\n| style=\"width:3em; width:200px;\"|'''''for Vice President'''''\n|-<--Do not add a generic image here, that would be forbidden under WP:IPH-->\n|[[File:Joe Biden official portrait 2013 cropped.jpg|alt=|center|200x200px]]<!-- DO NOT CHANGE WITHOUT PRIOR CONSENSUS.

The series of [[United States presidential primary|presidential primary elections and caucuses]] are being held from February to August 2020. This nominating process is an indirect election, where voters cast ballots selecting a slate of delegates to a political party's [[United States presidential nominating convention|nominating convention]], who then in turn elect their party's nominees for president and vice president.\n\n[[Donald Trump]], the 45th and incumbent president, has launched a reelection campaign for the Republican primaries; several state Republican Party organizations have cancelled their primaries in a show of support for his candidacy.<ref name=\"6KjVJ\" /> Trump became the presumptive Republican nominee on March 17, 2020 after securing a majority of pledged delegates.<ref name=\"EHTx4\" /> 29 major candidates launched [[2020 Democratic Party presidential primaries|campaigns for the Democratic nomination]], which became the largest field of candidates for any political party in the post-[[McGovern\u2013Fraser Commission|reform]] period of American politics.

The winner of the 2020 presidential election is scheduled to be inaugurated on January 20, 2021.\n\nBiden and Trump are respectively the oldest and second-oldest major party presumptive nominees in U.S. history;{{efn|[[Ronald Reagan]], currently the oldest major party nominee to contest a presidential general election, was 73 when [[1984 United States presidential election|re-elected in 1984]] whereas Biden will be 77 and Trump will be 74 on Election Day in 2020.}} and if he is elected and inaugurated, Biden will also become the oldest serving president.{{efn|On Inauguration Day in 2021, Biden will be 78 years, 62 days old which is [[List of presidents of the United States by age|79 days older]] than [[Ronald Reagan]] was when he left office in 1989.

W. Bush]] was an incumbent vice president at the time of the [[1988 United States presidential election|1988]] and [[Al Gore]] was an incumbent vice president at the time of the [[2000 United States presidential election|2000]] elections).\n\n==Background==\n===Procedure===\n{{further|United States presidential election#Procedure}}\n\n[[Article Two of the United States Constitution|Article Two]] of the [[United States Constitution]] states that for a person to serve as president the individual must be a [[Natural-born-citizen clause|natural-born citizen of the United States]], at least 35 years old and a United States resident for at least 14 years. Candidates for the presidency typically seek the nomination of one of the [[List of political parties in the United States|various political parties]] of the United States, in which case each party develops a method (such as a [[primary election]]) to choose the candidate the party deems best suited to run for the position. The primary elections are usually [[indirect election]]s where voters cast ballots for a slate of party delegates pledged to a particular candidate. The party's delegates then officially nominate a candidate to run on the party's behalf. The presidential nominee typically chooses a vice presidential [[running mate]] to form that party's [[Ticket (election)|ticket]], who is then ratified by the delegates (with the exception of the [[Libertarian Party (United States)|Libertarian Party]], which nominates its vice presidential candidate by delegate vote regardless of the presidential nominee's preference). The general election in November is also an indirect election, in which voters cast ballots for a slate of members of the [[Electoral College (United States)|Electoral College]]; these electors then directly elect the president and vice president.<ref name=\"rQNzf\" /> If [[contingent election|no candidate receives the minimum 270 electoral votes needed to win the election]], the [[United States House of Representatives]] will select the president from the three candidates who received the most electoral votes, and the [[United States Senate]] will select the vice president from the candidates who received the two highest totals.\n\nOn August 26, 2019, the [[Maine legislature]] passed a bill adopting [[ranked-choice voting in the United States|ranked-choice voting]] both for presidential primaries and for the general election.<ref name=\"ovz9x\" /><ref name=\"qhJpi\" /> On September 6, 2019, Governor [[Janet Mills]] allowed the bill to become law without her signature, which delayed it from taking effect until after the [[2020 Maine Democratic primary|2020 Democratic primary]] in March, but puts Maine on track to be the first state to use ranked-choice voting for a presidential general election. The law continues the use of the [[United States Electoral College#Congressional district method|congressional district method]] for the allocation of electors, as [[Maine]] and [[Nebraska]] have used in recent elections.<ref name=\"FcJYG\" /> The change could potentially delay the projection of the winner(s) of Maine's electoral votes for days after election day,<ref name=\"h81aa\" /> and will also complicate interpretation of the national [[direct election|popular vote]].<ref name=\"TijwC\" />\n\nThe [[Twenty-second Amendment to the United States Constitution|Twenty-second Amendment]] to the [[United States Constitution|Constitution]] states that an individual cannot be elected to the presidency more than twice. This prohibits former presidents [[Bill Clinton]], [[George W. Bush]], and [[Barack Obama]] from being elected president again. Former president [[Jimmy Carter]], having served only a single term as president, is not constitutionally prohibited from being elected to another term in the 2020 election, though he has no plans to do so, saying, \"95 is out of the question. I'm having a hard time walking. I think the time has passed for me to be involved actively in politics, much less run for president.\"<ref name=\"WJoNg\" />\n\n===Demographic trends===\n{{further|Demography of the United States}}\n\nThe age group of what will then be people in the 18-to-45-year-old bracket is expected to represent just under 40 percent of the United States' eligible voters in 2020. It is expected that more than 30 percent of eligible American voters will be [[Person of color|nonwhite]].<ref name=\"JbYBK\" />\n\nA bipartisan report indicates that changes in voter demographics since the [[2016 United States presidential election#Voter demographics|2016 election]] could impact the results of the 2020 election. [[African Americans]], [[Hispanic]]s, [[Asian people|Asians]], and other ethnic minorities, as well as \"whites with a college degree\", are expected to all increase their percentage of national eligible voters by 2020, while \"whites without a college degree\" will decrease. Generation Z, those born after 1996, will more than double to 10% of the eligible voters.<ref name=\"4vRND\" />\nTraditionally, all these shifts were thought to potentially be an advantage for the Democratic nominee as they all have historically voted substantially more for Democrats than Republicans and continue to, however; that rate at which these groups, especially Generation Z, vote for Democrats is decreasing, with non-whites<ref name=\"JnDmH\" /> and young voters<ref name=\"QXhgH\" /> both voting for and supporting Republicans at higher rates than before 2016.  However, this is counteracted by whites and 65+ voters both voting for and supporting Democrats at a higher rate.  These shifts have been slight overall nationally but substantially larger in swing states such as Wisconsin, Michigan and Iowa.<ref name=\"KB6cE\" /><ref name=\"c69Oy\" /><ref name=\"YirDI\" /><ref name=\"rBwrM\" /> These shifts tend to occur more geographically favorably for Republicans than Democrats<ref name=\"WOT96\" />, thus; it is possible Trump could win the [[Electoral College (United States)|Electoral College]] while still losing the popular vote, possibly by an even larger margin than in 2016.<ref name=\"6EgES\" />\n\n===Simultaneous elections===\n{{further|2020 United States Senate elections|2020 United States House of Representatives elections}}\n\nThe presidential election will occur simultaneously with elections to the [[2020 United States Senate elections|Senate]] and the [[2020 United States House of Representatives elections|House of Representatives]]. Gubernatorial and legislative elections will also be held in several states. Following the election, the United States House will redistribute the seats among the 50 states based on the results of the [[2020 United States Census]], and the states will conduct a [[United States redistricting, 2022|redistricting]] of Congressional and state legislative districts.

Later on, Ong's father received two separate phone calls on 26 May and 5 June in which the caller claimed he had kidnapped Ong and demanded a ransom from Ong's father to free his son. A ransom of $20,000 was eventually negotiated and paid, but still, there was no sign of Ong. A week after the ransom was paid, a rental car owner found one of the cars he rented out three weeks before had a foul-smelling odour. Tests revealed that the smell was that of blood. The person who last rented the car was found to be 24-year-old Richard Lai Chun Seng. Lai confessed that he, along with four others, was part of a kidnapping, in which the victim was none other than the missing youth Ong Beang Leck. Lai also stated that he took part in the plan as he needed money to save his failing business, and that he thought the plan was to lure Ong into the rental car, render the youth unconscious and held him hostage until the ransom was paid; however, on the night of 24 June 1968, as soon as Ong entered the car, Lai was shocked to see the three of his four other accomplices taking out weapons he was unaware of and attacked Ong, which led to the boy's death. This relevation led to the arrest of the other four accomplices; one of them was Ong's 24-year-old close friend Lee Chor Pet, the others were 29-year-old Chow Sien Cheong, 32-year-old Lim Kim Kwee, and 23-year-old Ho Kee Fatt (the latter two had ran off to Malaysia before their arrest by the Royal Malaysian Police). Lee led the police to a manhole in Jurong, where Ong's highly decomposed body was found. Lee, Lim and Ho, who were the three people assaulting Ong right from the back of the car, were charged with the murder of the youth. The three were found guilty of murder and sentenced to death on 11 June 1970, and all the three men were hanged on 27 January 1973. Lai, who became the prosecution's main witness, was subsequently jailed for 4 years for his involvement in both the ransom negotiation and the abduction of Ong. For possessing the ransom money, Chow was also given a 4-year jail sentence as well.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mewatch.sg/en/series/true-files-s3/ep8/367512|title=True Files S3|website=meWATCH|access-date=2020-04-22}}</ref>\n\n==1970s==\n\n===1970===\n* 6 January 1970: 31-year-old dance hostess Mimi Wong Weng Siu (\u9ec4\u5a49\u79c0) and 37-year-old sweeper Sim Woh Kum (\u51bc\u677e\u9526) in late 1969 were convicted of murder of a Mrs Watanabe and sentenced to death on 7 December 1970.

During the robbery, when Harun went around the house to look for valuables to steal, Yasin was restraining the victim and tried to rape her. While he was trying to rape her, Yasin sat on Poon's chest, which led to fractures on her ribs, and these fractures led to Poon's death. The two men proceeded to dispose the body into the sea before returning to the mainland, but the body was unexpectedly fished out from the sea by a fisherman the following morning. 9 months later, when he was arrested for theft, Harun surprised his interrogators by confessing to them about his involvement in the robbery. This confession led to Yasin's arrest, and the two men were charged with the murder of Poon Sai Imm. At the end of their trial in early 1974, Harun was found guilty of robbery by night and sentenced to 12 years' jail and 12 strokes of the cane, while Yasin was found guilty of murder and sentenced to death. Although Yasin's appeal was rejected by the Court of Appeal, his appeal to the Privy Council in London was accepted and he was sentenced to 2 years' jail for committing a rash/negligient act which results in death.

When confronted, 29-year-old Ong Yeow Tian ran off while one of the policeman, Police Constable (PC) Chua Yeu Hua arrested his accomplice. The other policeman, 22-year-old PC Mirza Abdul Halim chased after Ong. Ong managed to hide in the bushes before launching an assault at PC Mizra. Ong used his weapon to stab PC Mizra before PC Mizra took out his revolver in an attempt to defend himself. Ong overpowered PC Mizra and shot him in the head before fleeing the scene together with the revolver. Ong fled in a taxi before it was sighted by another two policemen, Sergeant Omar Amin and PC Benny Goh. The taxi was pulled over and out of a sudden, Ong use the stolen revolver to fire at them. In return, PC Goh successfully shot Ong in the abdomen before he managed to flee. The [[Police Tactical Unit (Singapore)|Police Task Force]] was activated to hunt for Ong. When one of the groups of the Police Task Force was patrolling, Ong who was hiding managed to shoot one of the man on patrol who was saved by a bulletproof vest. He was eventually subdued and arrested. PC Mizra went into a coma. He was given the rare field promotion to the rank of Corporal before Corporal Mizra passed away a day after the shooting. Ong's accomplice received jail and caning while Ong was found guilty for unlawful discharge of firearms and sentenced to death.

She was last seen at her school, boarding her school bus at 1 pm. 12 days later, her highly decomposed body was discovered by NS servicemen undergoing their training exercises at Yishun Industrial Park. Forensic pathologist Chao Tzee Cheng could not ascertain the cause of death: he could not tell whether it was a suicide, murder or accident due to the corpse's state of severe decomposition. Nevertheless, the police investigations narrowed down to one suspect: Liang's 35-year-old school bus driver Oh Laye Koh. Oh was then charged with her murder, purely based on circumstantial evidence. He was initially acquitted of her murder at the end of his trial in 1992; however, the prosecution appealed against his acquittal, pointing out how Oh, despite his insistence that he did not kill Liang or know her whereabouts, was able to lead police to the place where Liang's bag and books were, which was some distance away from where her body was found; Oh claimed he went to fix his brakes at 1 pm when the girl was last seen alive, but it was found that he went there at 9 am; and lastly, he even contacted and tried to convince the witnesses to testify on his behalf that they did not see his bus that day. The appeal was accepted, and the re-trial started on 27 April 1994. Oh Laye Koh chose to remain silent when he was told to make his defence. At the end of Oh's re-trial on 3 May 1994, Judicial Commissioner Amarjeet Singh concluded from Oh's decision to remain silent and also his failure to provide evidence \"arose from a consciousness of guilt in the face of the circumstantial evidence\". In JC Singh's words, he said to Oh in his verdict, \"I am constrained to draw an irresistible inference that you were the last person with the deceased and you had intentionally caused her death and that the deceased's death was not suicidal or accidental. Although the prosecution was unable to identify the unlawful act, it is not necessary, in my opinion, always to do so.\" As such, JC Singh found Oh guilty and sentenced him to death for the murder of Liang Shan Shan. Oh's appeal was dismissed on 29 June 1994, and he was hanged on 19 May 1995. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mewatch.sg/en/series/true-files-s2/ep10/367437|title=True Files S2|website=meWATCH|access-date=2020-04-22}}</ref> <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mewatch.sg/en/series/whispers-of-the-dead-s2/ep6/379405|title=Whispers Of The Dead S2|website=meWATCH|access-date=2020-04-22}}</ref>\n\n==1990s==\n\n===1991===\n* 4 May 1991: Filipino domestic worker [[Flor Contemplacion]] murdered another Filipino domestic worker, Della Maga, and Nicholas Huang, the four-year-old son of Maga's employer.

Asokan, were both sentenced to death for the murder of illegal moneylender Tan Heng Hong. Some time in November 1992, both Maniam and Asokan murdered Tan and drove Tan's car to Mandai, burning it together with Tan's corpse. Despite the charred remains, Tan's identity was ascertained, as well as the cause of death: the late forensic pathologist Professor Chao Tzee Cheng identified that the cause of Tan's death was a cut artery on his neck and that he did not die in the fire. Maniam, who was eventually arrested and charged in January 1993, claimed at the trial that on the night of Tan's murder, while the three of them were arguing violently over letting Tan to pay back Asokan's commission, Asokan became so agitated that he picked up the axe Maniam bought the day before to kill Tan, and it was Asokan's idea to burn the corpse, proclaiming his innocence and he himself was forced to help dispose the corpse out of fear. However, Asokan, who fled to Malaysia and got extradited back to Singapore to face trial, stated that Maniam told him to grab the axe and kill Tan when he refused to pay the commission, saying that he did not mean to hit or kill him, and that he was only following Maniam's orders. However, the judge rejected their defences and stated that if they had no intention to kill, the weapons would not have been brought in the first place, and decided that they both shared a common intention to murder Tan, therefore both of the men were convicted as charged and sentenced to death. The two men were eventually hanged on 9 September 1995. This case was re-enacted in \"Whispers Of The Dead\", a Singaporean crime show which features the notable cases solved by Professor Chao, though some aspects of the case, as well as the identities of those involved were changed for dramatic purposes. <ref> {{Cite web|url=https://www.mewatch.sg/en/series/whispers-of-the-dead-s2/ep5/377256|title=Whispers Of The Dead S2|website=Toggle|access-date=2020-04-21}} </ref> <ref>{{cite news|title=Two murderers hanged|url=https://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/newspapers/digitised/issue/straitstimes19950909-1&ved=2ahUKEwj3ur7H8PnoAhVCWX0KHbD-DtcQFjAAegQIAxAB&usg=AOvVaw1Q8UplYrrw-kIoFuel_4Uf|newspaper=The Straits Times|}}</ref>\n\n===1994===\n\n* 6 June 1994: Known as the Oriental Hotel Murder, 25-year-old Abdul Nasir bin Amer Hamsah and 32-year-old Abdul Rahman bin Arshad barged into the room shared by two Japanese tourists - Fujii Isae, 49 and Miyoko Takishita, 56. Earlier on that day itself, the two men, who were acquaintances, went to the Oriental Hotel for a job interview when they both spotted the Japanese tour group which Fujii and Takishita were with, and seeing this, the two men decided to rob the Japanese tourists. Both men robbed and assaulted the two women; Takishita was assaulted by Abdul Rahman and she pretended to faint to escape further injury. When Abdul Nasir attempted to escape after severely assaulting and robbing Fujii, he lost his balance and accidentally stepped onto Fujii's face as he held onto the wall to try to steady himself, causing a facial fracture which obstructed her breathing and caused her death. 2 years later, Abdul Nasir was arrested for attempting to rob and murder a taxi driver, and his fingerprints were found to match those found in Fujii and Takishita's room. Abdul Nasir confessed that he was involved in the robbery, and Abdul Rahman was later found to be in prison serving a 20-month jail sentence for theft. Both men were charged with murder; however, Abdul Rahman's charge was reduced to robbery with hurt, and he was sentenced to 10 years' jail with 16 strokes of the cane. At Abdul Nasir's murder trial, the presiding judge, Judicial Commissioner Choo Han Teck accepted Abdul Nasir's defence that he accidentally stepped onto Fujii's face while he rejected the prosecution's arguement that Abdul Nasir intentionally stamped onto Fujii's face to kill her. For this, Abdul Nasir was acquitted of murder, and he was instead sentenced to 18 years' jail and 18 strokes of the cane for robbery with hurt. The prosecution appealed against Abdul Nasir's acquittal. However by a split decision of 2-1, the Court of Appeal dismissed the appeal. That did not mark an end to Abdul Nasir's ordeal, as he had to go back to court to face a kidnapping charge, which he committed during the time of his remand. At the time of his remand, Abdul Nasir, together with drug trafficker Low Theng Gee briefly kidnapped two police officers for ransom before being subdued by the police. Abdul Nasir was later found guilty of kidnapping and sentenced to life imprisonment and 12 strokes of the cane on 3 March 1997. Justice T. S. Sinnathuray, who presided over Abdul Nasir's trial for kidnapping, ordered the life sentence to run consecutively with the jail term Abdul Nasir received for robbing Fujii, meaning Abdul Nasir will be serving a total of 38 years in prison (at that time, life imprisonment in Singapore was defined as a 20-year jail sentence). Abdul Nasir appealed for the two jail terms to run concurrently, but the appeal was dismissed on 20 August 1997. However, Chief Justice Yong Pung How also ruled that life imprisonment should be considered as a term of imprisonment for the remainder of a prisoner's natural life instead of a jail term of 20 years. This amendment will apply to future cases after 20 August 1997. Abdul Nasir was not affected by this amendment, so his life term was still a jail term of 20 years, and thus he would still be jailed for 38 years.<ref> {{cite web|title=oriental_hotel_murder|url=https://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/infopedia/articles/SIP_1804_2011-04-04.html}} </ref> <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/courts-crime/former-detective-richard-lim-beng-gee-65-dies-5-high-profile-cases-he-helped|title=Former detective Richard Lim Beng Gee, 65, dies: 5 high-profile cases he helped crack / ASSAULT ON TWO JAPANESE TOURISTS IN 5-STAR HOTEL|last=Lee|first=Min Kok|date=2016-01-19|website=The Straits Times|language=en|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191012154609/https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/courts-crime/former-detective-richard-lim-beng-gee-65-dies-5-high-profile-cases-he-helped|archive-date=2019-10-12|access-date=2019-10-14}}</ref> <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mewatch.sg/en/series/true-files-s3/ep9/367513|title=True Files S3|website=Toggle|access-date=2020-04-21}}</ref>\n\n===1995===\n\n* 26 February 1995: Britain's oldest merchant bank [[Barings Bank]] collapsed due to Briton [[Nick Leeson]]'s trading activities, who lost $1.4 billion by speculating on the [[Singapore International Monetary Exchange]], primarily using [[futures contracts]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Barings Bank collapses from Nick Leeson's losses |url=http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/history/events/e7cb71fe-b7b9-445e-b5d1-655bf301d6a8|website=NLB|accessdate=20 July 2019|date=26 February 1995}}</ref> He was arrested on 23 November 1995 after fleeing Singapore for 272 days.

He was charged with murder, but it was found and proven in the middle of the trial that Somsak was fully intoxicated at the time he killed Choochai due to him having consumed too much alcohol before the killing; this has substantially impaired his mental responsibility at the time of the killing.

He seized Lim's family valuables before tying up Lim, his wife, his daughter and Lim's maid. He then proceeded to shoot and kill Lim, where five of the six bullets hit Lim. He managed to flee the country with the help of his accomplice, Ho Yueh Keong. He was nabbed by the [[Royal Malaysian Police]] 10 days later at a hotel in Kuala Lumpur before being extradited back to Singapore on 1 March 2006. Initially charged with murder, his charge was amended to discharging of firearm. During the trial, Tan choose to be unrepresented. In one of his defence, he claimed that Lim was about to hit him with a chair and thus shot Lim in self-defence. But his defence fell flat when the prosecution noted that Lim was tied up and could not have lifted the chair. On 22 May 2007, he was found guilty and sentenced to hang.

Later on, Ong's father received two separate phone calls on 26 May and 5 June in which the caller claimed he had kidnapped Ong and demanded a ransom from Ong's father to free his son. A ransom of $20,000 was eventually negotiated and paid, but still, there was no sign of Ong. A week after the ransom was paid, a rental car owner found one of the cars he rented out three weeks before had a foul-smelling odour. Tests revealed that the smell was that of blood. The person who last rented the car was found to be 24-year-old Richard Lai Chun Seng. Lai confessed that he, along with four others, was part of a kidnapping, in which the victim was none other than the missing youth Ong Beang Leck. Lai also stated that he took part in the plan as he needed money to save his failing business, and that he thought the plan was to lure Ong into the rental car, render the youth unconscious and held him hostage until the ransom was paid; however, on the night of 24 June 1968, as soon as Ong entered the car, Lai was shocked to see the three of his four other accomplices taking out weapons he was unaware of and attacked Ong, which led to the boy's death. This relevation led to the arrest of the other four accomplices; one of them was Ong's 24-year-old close friend Lee Chor Pet, the others were 29-year-old Chow Sien Cheong, 32-year-old Lim Kim Kwee, and 23-year-old Ho Kee Fatt (the latter two had ran off to Malaysia before their arrest by the Royal Malaysian Police). Lee led the police to a manhole in Jurong, where Ong's highly decomposed body was found. Lee, Lim and Ho, who were the three people assaulting Ong right from the back of the car, were charged with the murder of the youth. The three were found guilty of murder and sentenced to death on 11 June 1970, and all the three men were hanged on 27 January 1973. Lai, who became the prosecution's main witness, was subsequently jailed for 4 years for his involvement in both the ransom negotiation and the abduction of Ong. For possessing the ransom money, Chow was also given a 4-year jail sentence as well.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mewatch.sg/en/series/true-files-s3/ep8/367512|title=True Files S3|website=meWATCH|access-date=2020-04-22}}</ref>\n\n==1970s==\n\n===1970===\n* 6 January 1970: 31-year-old dance hostess Mimi Wong Weng Siu (\u9ec4\u5a49\u79c0) and 37-year-old sweeper Sim Woh Kum (\u51bc\u677e\u9526) in late 1969 were convicted of murder of a Mrs Watanabe and sentenced to death on 7 December 1970.

During the robbery, when Harun went around the house to look for valuables to steal, Yasin was restraining the victim and tried to rape her. While he was trying to rape her, Yasin sat on Poon's chest, which led to fractures on her ribs, and these fractures led to Poon's death. The two men proceeded to dispose the body into the sea before returning to the mainland, but the body was unexpectedly fished out from the sea by a fisherman the following morning. 9 months later, when he was arrested for theft, Harun surprised his interrogators by confessing to them about his involvement in the robbery. This confession led to Yasin's arrest, and the two men were charged with the murder of Poon Sai Imm. At the end of their trial in early 1974, Harun was found guilty of robbery by night and sentenced to 12 years' jail and 12 strokes of the cane, while Yasin was found guilty of murder and sentenced to death. Although Yasin's appeal was rejected by the Court of Appeal, his appeal to the Privy Council in London was accepted and he was sentenced to 2 years' jail for committing a rash/negligient act which results in death. However, that was not the end of Yasin's ordeal, as he was charged with raping Poon and brought back to court. At the trial, Yasin denied raping the elderly woman despite the abundant forensic evidence presented by the prosecution and the testimony given by Harun (who became the prosecution's chief witness) against him. At the end of the trial on 12 May 1977, Yasin was found guilty of attempted rape and sentenced to serve another 8 years in prison. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mewatch.sg/en/series/true-files-s3/ep6/367508|title=True Files S3|website=meWATCH|access-date=2020-04-22}}</ref>\n\n* 18 September 1972: A 22-year-old seamstress Cheng Li Zhen was walking along [[Queenstown, Singapore|Queenstown]] with her sister when she suddenly screamed and collapsed to the ground with blood oozing out from her chest.

The two men each took turns to inflict a blow on Kalingam with the rake; the second blow, which was inflicted by Rathakrishnan, was revealed to be fatal according to autopsy reports presented at the trial. As a result of his injuries, Kalingam lost consciousness and fell onto the grass. Afterwards, the two then proceeded to pour petrol onto him, and set fire on him, causing Kalingam to be burned to death. Both were later found guilty of murder in July 1984; Ramu was condemned to death and he headed to the gallows on 19 September 1986, while Rathakrishnan, who was under the age of 18 when he committed the murder, was spared the gallows and detained indefinitely at the President's pleasure.

They were armed with a rifle Sek had stolen from Nee Soon camp. All five victims: Tay, his wife, their Filipino maid, Tay's daughter and her tutor were confined to a bedroom. They proceeded to rob Tay's family of their jewellery and cash out money from their bank accounts. While Nyu was guarding the victims, Sek decided to murder all five victims by escorting them one-by-one out of the bedroom in a bid to erase witnesses. Sek proceeded to struck Tay and his wife with a chair and strangled them. Sek also strangled their maid. In all, Sek murdered 3 people. Nyu discovered Sek's murder intentions only when he caught him in the act in another room. Fearing that Tay's daughter and her tutor would be next, Nyu carried the rifle with him and locked the bedroom door upon dashing in. When Sek's repeated requests to open the door was denied by Nyu, Sek immediately fled. Nyu then released Tay's daughter and her tutor. Nyu fled to Malaysia before he surrendered and was extradited to Singapore. Sek was arrested at his sister's home on 29 July, where he attempted suicide when police were closing in on him. During the trial, when asked how he felt when strangling Tay's wife, Sek brought up an incident when he was nearly strangled by someone at the Singapore Boys\u2019 Home until he blacked out.

She was last seen at her school, boarding her school bus at 1 pm. 12 days later, her highly decomposed body was discovered by NS servicemen undergoing their training exercises at Yishun Industrial Park. Forensic pathologist Chao Tzee Cheng could not ascertain the cause of death: he could not tell whether it was a suicide, murder or accident due to the corpse's state of severe decomposition. Nevertheless, the police investigations narrowed down to one suspect: Liang's 35-year-old school bus driver Oh Laye Koh. Oh was then charged with her murder, purely based on circumstantial evidence. He was initially acquitted of her murder at the end of his trial in 1992; however, the prosecution appealed against his acquittal, pointing out how Oh, despite his insistence that he did not kill Liang or know her whereabouts, was able to lead police to the place where Liang's bag and books were, which was some distance away from where her body was found; Oh claimed he went to fix his brakes at 1 pm when the girl was last seen alive, but it was found that he went there at 9 am; and lastly, he even contacted and tried to convince the witnesses to testify on his behalf that they did not see his bus that day. The appeal was accepted, and the re-trial started on 27 April 1994. Oh Laye Koh chose to remain silent when he was told to make his defence. At the end of Oh's re-trial on 3 May 1994, Judicial Commissioner Amarjeet Singh concluded from Oh's decision to remain silent and also his failure to provide evidence \"arose from a consciousness of guilt in the face of the circumstantial evidence\". In JC Singh's words, he said to Oh in his verdict, \"I am constrained to draw an irresistible inference that you were the last person with the deceased and you had intentionally caused her death and that the deceased's death was not suicidal or accidental. Although the prosecution was unable to identify the unlawful act, it is not necessary, in my opinion, always to do so.\" As such, JC Singh found Oh guilty and sentenced him to death for the murder of Liang Shan Shan. Oh's appeal was dismissed on 29 June 1994, and he was hanged on 19 May 1995. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mewatch.sg/en/series/true-files-s2/ep10/367437|title=True Files S2|website=meWATCH|access-date=2020-04-22}}</ref> <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mewatch.sg/en/series/whispers-of-the-dead-s2/ep6/379405|title=Whispers Of The Dead S2|website=meWATCH|access-date=2020-04-22}}</ref>\n\n==1990s==\n\n===1991===\n* 4 May 1991: Filipino domestic worker [[Flor Contemplacion]] murdered another Filipino domestic worker, Della Maga, and Nicholas Huang, the four-year-old son of Maga's employer.

Asokan, were both sentenced to death for the murder of illegal moneylender Tan Heng Hong. Some time in November 1992, both Maniam and Asokan murdered Tan and drove Tan's car to Mandai, burning it together with Tan's corpse. Despite the charred remains, Tan's identity was ascertained, as well as the cause of death: the late forensic pathologist Professor Chao Tzee Cheng identified that the cause of Tan's death was a cut artery on his neck and that he did not die in the fire. Maniam, who was eventually arrested and charged in January 1993, claimed at the trial that on the night of Tan's murder, while the three of them were arguing violently over letting Tan to pay back Asokan's commission, Asokan became so agitated that he picked up the axe Maniam bought the day before to kill Tan, and it was Asokan's idea to burn the corpse, proclaiming his innocence and he himself was forced to help dispose the corpse out of fear. However, Asokan, who fled to Malaysia and got extradited back to Singapore to face trial, stated that Maniam told him to grab the axe and kill Tan when he refused to pay the commission, saying that he did not mean to hit or kill him, and that he was only following Maniam's orders. However, the judge rejected their defences and stated that if they had no intention to kill, the weapons would not have been brought in the first place, and decided that they both shared a common intention to murder Tan, therefore both of the men were convicted as charged and sentenced to death. The two men were eventually hanged on 9 September 1995.

Earlier on that day itself, the two men, who were acquaintances, went to the Oriental Hotel for a job interview when they both spotted the Japanese tour group which Fujii and Takishita were with, and seeing this, the two men decided to rob the Japanese tourists. Both men robbed and assaulted the two women; Takishita was assaulted by Abdul Rahman and she pretended to faint to escape further injury. When Abdul Nasir attempted to escape after severely assaulting and robbing Fujii, he lost his balance and accidentally stepped onto Fujii's face as he held onto the wall to try to steady himself, causing a facial fracture which obstructed her breathing and caused her death. 2 years later, Abdul Nasir was arrested for attempting to rob and murder a taxi driver, and his fingerprints were found to match those found in Fujii and Takishita's room. Abdul Nasir confessed that he was involved in the robbery, and Abdul Rahman was later found to be in prison serving a 20-month jail sentence for theft. Both men were charged with murder; however, Abdul Rahman's charge was reduced to robbery with hurt, and he was sentenced to 10 years' jail with 16 strokes of the cane. At Abdul Nasir's murder trial, the presiding judge, Judicial Commissioner Choo Han Teck accepted Abdul Nasir's defence that he accidentally stepped onto Fujii's face while he rejected the prosecution's arguement that Abdul Nasir intentionally stamped onto Fujii's face to kill her. For this, Abdul Nasir was acquitted of murder, and he was instead sentenced to 18 years' jail and 18 strokes of the cane for robbery with hurt. The prosecution appealed against Abdul Nasir's acquittal. However by a split decision of 2-1, the Court of Appeal dismissed the appeal. That did not mark an end to Abdul Nasir's ordeal, as he had to go back to court to face a kidnapping charge, which he committed during the time of his remand. At the time of his remand, Abdul Nasir, together with drug trafficker Low Theng Gee briefly kidnapped two police officers for ransom before being subdued by the police. Abdul Nasir was later found guilty of kidnapping and sentenced to life imprisonment and 12 strokes of the cane on 3 March 1997. Justice T. S. Sinnathuray, who presided over Abdul Nasir's trial for kidnapping, ordered the life sentence to run consecutively with the jail term Abdul Nasir received for robbing Fujii, meaning Abdul Nasir will be serving a total of 38 years in prison (at that time, life imprisonment in Singapore was defined as a 20-year jail sentence). Abdul Nasir appealed for the two jail terms to run concurrently, but the appeal was dismissed on 20 August 1997.

Specific gravity for liquids is nearly always measured with respect to [[water (molecule)|water]] at its densest (at {{cvt|4|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|1|disp=or}}); for gases, air at [[room temperature]] ({{cvt|20|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|disp=or}}) is the reference. The term \"relative density\" is often preferred in scientific usage. It is defined as a ratio of density of particular substance with that of water.\n\nIf a substance's relative density is less than one then it is less dense than the reference; if greater than 1 then it is denser than the reference. If the relative density is exactly 1 then the densities are equal; that is, equal volumes of the two substances have the same mass.  If the reference material is water, then a substance with a relative density (or specific gravity) less than 1 will float in water. For example, an ice cube, with a relative density of about 0.91, will float. A substance with a relative density greater than 1 will sink.\n\nTemperature and pressure must be specified for both the sample and the reference. Pressure is nearly always 1 [[Atmosphere (unit)|atm]] (101.325 [[Pascal (unit)|kPa]]). Where it is not, it is more usual to specify the density directly. Temperatures for both sample and reference vary from industry to industry. In British brewing practice, the specific gravity, as specified above, is multiplied by 1000.<ref name=briggs>Hough, J.S., Briggs, D.E., Stevens, R and Young, T.W. Malting and Brewing Science, Vol. II Hopped Wort and Beer, Chapman and Hall, London, 1991, p. 881</ref> Specific gravity is commonly used in industry as a simple means of obtaining information about the concentration of solutions of various materials such as [[brine]]s, [[sugar]] solutions ([[syrup]]s, juices, honeys, brewers [[wort]], [[must]], etc.) and acids.\n\n==Basic calculation==\nRelative density(''RD'') or specific gravity (''SG'') is a [[dimensionless quantity]], as it is the ratio of either densities or weights\n\n:<math>\n\\mathit{RD} = \\frac{\\rho_\\mathrm{substance}}{\\rho_\\mathrm{reference}}\\,\n</math>\n\nwhere ''R+D'' is relative density, ''\u03c1<sub>substance</sub>'' is the density of the substance being measured, and ''\u03c1<sub>reference</sub>'' is the density of the reference. (By convention ''\u03c1'', the Greek letter [[Rho (letter)|rho]], denotes density.)\n\nThe reference material can be indicated using subscripts: ''RD''<sub>substance/reference</sub>, which means \"the relative density of ''substance'' with respect to ''reference''\". If the reference is not explicitly stated then it is normally assumed to be [[water]] at 4&nbsp;\u00b0[[Celsius|C]] (or, more precisely, 3.98&nbsp;\u00b0[[Celsius|C]], which is the temperature at which water reaches its maximum density). In [[International System of Units|SI]] units, the density of water is (approximately) 1000&nbsp;[[Kilogram|kg]]/[[Cubic metre|m<sup>3</sup>]] or 1&nbsp;[[Gram|g]]/[[Cubic centimetre|cm<sup>3</sup>]], which makes relative density calculations particularly convenient: the density of the object only needs to be divided by 1000 or 1, depending on the units.\n\nThe relative density of gases is often measured with respect to dry [[air]] at a temperature of 20&nbsp;\u00b0C and a pressure of 101.325 kPa absolute, which has a density of 1.205&nbsp;kg/m<sup>3</sup>. Relative density with respect to air can be obtained by\n\n:<math>\n\\mathit{RD} = \\frac{\\rho_\\mathrm{gas}}{\\rho_{\\mathrm{air}}} \\approx \\frac{M_\\mathrm{gas}}{M_{\\mathrm{air}}}\n</math>\n\nWhere ''M'' is the [[molar mass]] and the approximately equal sign is used because equality pertains only if 1 [[Mole (unit)|mol]] of the gas and 1&nbsp;mol of air occupy the same volume at a given temperature and pressure i.e. they are both [[Ideal gas]]es. Ideal behaviour is usually only seen at very low pressure. For example, one mol of an ideal gas occupies 22.414 L at 0&nbsp;\u00b0C and 1 atmosphere whereas [[carbon dioxide]] has a molar volume of 22.259 L under those same conditions.\n\nThose with SG greater than 1 are denser than water and will, disregarding [[surface tension]] effects, sink in it. Those with an SG less than 1 are less dense than water and will float on it. In scientific work, the relationship of mass to volume is usually expressed directly in terms of the density (mass per unit volume) of the substance under study. It is in industry where specific gravity finds wide application, often for historical reasons.\n\nTrue specific gravity of a liquid can be expressed mathematically as:\n\n:<math> SG_\\text{true} = \\frac {\\rho_\\text{sample}}{\\rho_\\mathrm{H_2O}}</math>\n\nwhere ''\u03c1''<sub>sample</sub> is the density of the sample and ''\u03c1''<sub>H<sub>2</sub>O</sub> is the density of water.\n\nThe apparent specific gravity is simply the ratio of the weights of equal volumes of sample and water in air:\n\n:<math> SG_\\text{apparent} = \\frac {W_{\\mathrm{A},\\text{sample}}}{W_{\\mathrm{A},\\mathrm{H_2O}}} </math>\n\nwhere ''W''<sub>A,sample</sub> represents the weight of the sample measured in air and ''W''<sub>A,H<sub>2</sub>O</sub> the weight of an equal volume of water  measured in air.\n\nIt can be shown that true specific gravity can be computed from different properties:\n\n:<math> SG_\\text{true} = \\frac {\\rho_\\text{sample}}{\\rho_\\mathrm{H_2O}} = \\frac {\\frac{m_\\text{sample}}{V}}{\\frac{m_\\mathrm{H_2O}}{V}} = \\frac {m_\\text{sample}}{m_\\mathrm{H_2O}} \\frac{g}{g} = \\frac {W_{\\mathrm{V},\\text{sample}}}{W_{\\mathrm{V},\\mathrm{H_2O}}} </math> \n\nwhere ''g'' is the local acceleration due to gravity, ''V'' is the volume of the sample and of water (the same for both), ''\u03c1''<sub>sample</sub> is the density of the sample, ''\u03c1''<sub>H<sub>2</sub>O</sub> is the density of water, ''W''<sub>V</sub> represents a weight obtained in vacuum, <math>\\mathit{m}_{\\text{sample}}</math> is the mass of the sample and <math>\\mathit{m}_{\\text{H}_{2}\\text{O}}</math>is the mass of an equal volume of water.\n\nThe density of water varies with temperature and pressure as does the density of the sample. So it is necessary to specify the temperatures and pressures at which the densities or weights were determined. It is nearly always the case that measurements are made at 1 nominal atmosphere (101.325&nbsp;kPa \u00b1 variations from changing weather patterns). But as specific gravity usually refers to highly incompressible aqueous solutions or other incompressible substances (such as petroleum products), variations in density caused by pressure are usually neglected at least where apparent specific gravity is being measured. For true (''in vacuo'') specific gravity calculations, air pressure must be considered (see below). Temperatures are specified by the notation (''T''<sub>s</sub>/''T''<sub>r</sub>), with ''T''<sub>s</sub> representing the temperature at which the sample's density was determined and ''T''<sub>r</sub> the temperature at which the reference (water) density is specified. For example, SG (20&nbsp;\u00b0C/4&nbsp;\u00b0C) would be understood to mean that the density of the sample was determined at 20&nbsp;\u00b0C and of the water at 4&nbsp;\u00b0C. Taking into account different sample and reference temperatures, we note that, while ''SG''<sub>H<sub>2</sub>O</sub> = {{val|1.000000}} (20&nbsp;\u00b0C/20&nbsp;\u00b0C), it is also the case that ''SG''<sub>H<sub>2</sub>O</sub> = {{frac|{{val|0.998203}}|{{val|0.999840}}}} = {{val|0.998363}} (20&nbsp;\u00b0C/4&nbsp;\u00b0C). Here, temperature is being specified using the current [[ITS-90]] scale and the densities<ref>{{cite book|last=Bettin|first=H.|last2=Spieweck|first2=F.|chapter=Die Dichte des Wassers als Funktion der Temperatur nach Einf\u00fchrung des Internationalen Temperaturskala von 1990|title=PTB-Mitteilungen 100|date=1990|pp=195\u2013196}}</ref> used here and in the rest of this article are based on that scale. On the previous IPTS-68 scale, the densities at 20&nbsp;\u00b0C and 4&nbsp;\u00b0C are {{val|0.9982071}} and {{val|0.9999720}} respectively, resulting in an SG (20&nbsp;\u00b0C/4&nbsp;\u00b0C) value for water of {{val|0.9982343}}.\n\nAs the principal use of specific gravity measurements in industry is determination of the concentrations of substances in aqueous solutions and as these are found in tables of SG versus concentration, it is extremely important that the analyst enter the table with the correct form of specific gravity. For example, in the brewing industry, the [[Plato scale|Plato table]] lists sucrose concentration by weight against true SG, and was originally (20&nbsp;\u00b0C/4&nbsp;\u00b0C)<ref>ASBC Methods of Analysis Preface to Table 1: Extract in Wort and Beer, American Society of Brewing Chemists, St Paul, 2009</ref> i.e. based on measurements of the density of sucrose solutions made at laboratory temperature (20&nbsp;\u00b0C) but referenced to the density of water at 4&nbsp;\u00b0C which is very close to the temperature at which water has its maximum density, ''\u03c1''<sub>H<sub>2</sub>O</sub> equal to 999.972&nbsp;kg/m<sup>3</sup> in [[International System of Units|SI units]] ({{val|0.999972|u=g/cm<sup>3</sup>}} in [[CGS system|cgs units]] or 62.43&nbsp;lb/cu&nbsp;ft in [[United States customary units]]). The [[American Society of Brewing Chemists|ASBC]] table<ref>ASBC Methods of Analysis ''op. cit.'' Table 1: Extract in Wort and Beer</ref> in use today in North America, while it is derived from the original Plato table is for apparent specific gravity measurements at (20&nbsp;\u00b0C/20&nbsp;\u00b0C) on the IPTS-68 scale where the density of water is {{val|0.9982071|u=g/cm<sup>3</sup>}}. In the sugar, soft drink, honey, fruit juice and related industries, sucrose concentration by weight is taken from a table prepared by [[Brix|A. Brix]], which uses SG (17.5&nbsp;\u00b0C/17.5&nbsp;\u00b0C). As a final example, the British SG units are based on reference and sample temperatures of 60&nbsp;\u00b0F and are thus (15.56&nbsp;\u00b0C/15.56&nbsp;\u00b0C).\n\nGiven the specific gravity of a substance, its actual density can be calculated by rearranging the above formula:\n\n:<math>{\\rho_\\text{substance}} = SG \\times \\rho_\\mathrm{H_2O}.</math>\n\nOccasionally a reference substance other than water is specified (for example, air), in which case specific gravity means density relative to that reference.\n\n==Temperature dependence==\n:''See [[Density]] for a table of the measured densities of water at various temperatures.''\n\nThe density of substances varies with temperature and pressure so that it is necessary to specify the temperatures and pressures at which the densities or masses were determined. It is nearly always the case that measurements are made at nominally 1 atmosphere (101.325&nbsp;kPa ignoring the variations caused by changing weather patterns) but as relative density usually refers to highly incompressible aqueous solutions or other incompressible substances (such as petroleum products) variations in density caused by pressure are usually neglected at least where apparent relative density is being measured. For true (''in vacuo'') relative density calculations air pressure must be considered (see below). Temperatures are specified by the notation (''T<sub>s</sub>''/''T<sub>r</sub>'') with ''T<sub>s</sub>'' representing the temperature at which the sample's density was determined and ''T<sub>r</sub>'' the temperature at which the reference (water) density is specified.

Taking into account different sample and reference temperatures we note that while SG<sub>H<sub>2</sub>O</sub> = 1.000000 (20&nbsp;\u00b0C/20&nbsp;\u00b0C) it is also the case that RD<sub>H<sub>2</sub>O</sub> = {{sfrac|0.998203|0.998840}} = 0.998363 (20&nbsp;\u00b0C/4&nbsp;\u00b0C).

Relative density is often used by [[Geology|geologists]] and [[Mineralogy|mineralogists]] to help determine the [[mineral]] content of a rock or other sample. [[Gemology|Gemologists]] use it as an aid in the identification of [[gemstone]]s. Water is preferred as the reference because measurements are then easy to carry out in the field (see below for examples of measurement methods).\n\nAs the principal use of relative density measurements in industry is determination of the concentrations of substances in aqueous solutions and these are found in tables of RD vs concentration it is extremely important that the analyst enter the table with the correct form of relative density.

As a final example, the British RD units are based on reference and sample temperatures of 60&nbsp;\u00b0F and are thus (15.56&nbsp;\u00b0C/15.56&nbsp;\u00b0C).<ref name=briggs/>\n\n==Measurement==\nRelative density can be calculated directly by measuring the density of a sample and dividing it by the (known) density of the reference substance. The density of the sample is simply its mass divided by its volume. Although mass is easy to measure, the volume of an irregularly shaped sample can be more difficult to ascertain. One method is to put the sample in a water-filled [[graduated cylinder]] and read off how much water it displaces. Alternatively the container can be filled to the brim, the sample immersed, and the volume of overflow measured. The [[surface tension]] of the water may keep a significant amount of water from overflowing, which is especially problematic for small samples. For this reason it is desirable to use a water container with as small a mouth as possible.\n\nFor each substance, the density, ''\u03c1'', is given by\n\n:<math>\\rho = \\frac{\\text{Mass}}{\\text{Volume}}\n = \\frac{\\text{Deflection} \\times \\frac{\\text{Spring Constant}}{\\text{Gravity}}}{\\text{Displacement}_\\mathrm{Water Line} \\times \\text{Area}_\\mathrm{Cylinder}}\\,\n</math>\n\nWhen these densities are divided, references to the spring constant, gravity and cross-sectional area simply cancel, leaving\n\n:<math>\nRD=\\frac{\\rho_\\mathrm{object}}{\\rho_\\mathrm{ref}}\n= \\frac{\\frac{\\text{Deflection}_\\mathrm{Obj.}}{\\text{Displacement}_\\mathrm{Obj.}}}{\\frac{\\text{Deflection}_\\mathrm{Ref.}}{\\text{Displacement}_\\mathrm{Ref.}}}\n = \\frac{\\frac{3\\ \\mathrm{in}}{20\\ \\mathrm{mm}}}{\\frac{5\\ \\mathrm{in}}{34\\ \\mathrm{mm}}}=\\frac{3\\ \\mathrm{in} \\times 34\\ \\mathrm{mm}}{5\\ \\mathrm{in} \\times 20\\ \\mathrm{mm}} = 1.02\\,\n</math>\n\n===Hydrostatic weighing===\n{{main article|Hydrostatic weighing}}\nRelative density is more easily and perhaps more accurately measured without measuring volume. Using a spring scale, the sample is weighed first in air and then in water. Relative density (with respect to water) can then be calculated using the following formula:\n\n:<math>\nRD = \\frac{W_\\mathrm{air}}{W_\\mathrm{air} - W_\\mathrm{water}}\n</math>\n\nwhere\n:''W''<sub>air</sub> is the weight of the sample in air (measured in [[newton (unit)|newton]]s, [[pound-force|pounds-force]] or some other unit of force)\n:''W''<sub>water</sub> is the weight of the sample in water (measured in the same units).\n\nThis technique cannot easily be used to measure relative densities less than one, because the sample will then float. ''W''<sub>water</sub> becomes a negative quantity, representing the force needed to keep the sample underwater.\n\nAnother practical method uses three measurements. The sample is weighed dry. Then a container filled to the brim with water is weighed, and weighed again with the sample immersed, after the displaced water has overflowed and been removed. Subtracting the last reading from the sum of the first two readings gives the weight of the displaced water. The relative density result is the dry sample weight divided by that of the displaced water. This method works with scales that can't easily accommodate a suspended sample, and also allows for measurement of samples that are less dense than water.\n\n===Hydrometer===\n{{main article|hydrometer}}\n[[File:Hydro.PNG|right|300px]]\nThe relative density of a liquid can be measured using a hydrometer. This consists of a bulb attached to a stalk of constant cross-sectional area, as shown in the adjacent diagram.\n\nFirst the hydrometer is floated in the reference liquid (shown in light blue), and the [[displacement (fluid)|displacement]] (the level of the liquid on the stalk) is marked (blue line). The reference could be any liquid, but in practice it is usually water.\n\nThe hydrometer is then floated in a liquid of unknown density (shown in green). The change in displacement, \u0394''x'', is noted. In the example depicted, the hydrometer has dropped slightly in the green liquid; hence its density is lower than that of the reference liquid. It is, of course, necessary that the hydrometer floats in both liquids.\n\nThe application of simple physical principles allows the relative density of the unknown liquid to be calculated from the change in displacement. (In practice the stalk of the hydrometer is pre-marked with graduations to facilitate this measurement.)\n\nIn the explanation that follows,\n\n:'''''\u03c1<sub>ref</sub>''''' is the known density ([[mass]] per unit [[volume]]) of the reference liquid (typically water).\n:'''''\u03c1<sub>new</sub>''' is the unknown density of the new (green) liquid.\n:'''''RD''<sub>new/ref</sub>''' is the relative density of the new liquid with respect to the reference.\n:'''''V''''' is the volume of reference liquid displaced, i.e. the red volume in the diagram.\n:'''''m''''' is the mass of the entire hydrometer.\n:'''''g''''' is the [[Earth's gravity|local gravitational constant]].\n:'''''\u0394x''''' is the change in displacement. In accordance with the way in which hydrometers are usually graduated, \u0394''x'' is here taken to be negative if the displacement line rises on the stalk of the hydrometer, and positive if it falls. In the example depicted, \u0394''x'' is negative.\n:'''''A''''' is the cross sectional area of the shaft.\n\nSince the floating hydrometer is in [[static equilibrium]], the downward gravitational force acting upon it must exactly balance the upward buoyancy force. The gravitational force acting on the hydrometer is simply its weight, ''mg''. From the [[Archimedes]] [[buoyancy]] principle, the buoyancy force acting on the hydrometer is equal to the weight of liquid displaced. This weight is equal to the mass of liquid displaced multiplied by ''g'', which in the case of the reference liquid is ''\u03c1<sub>ref</sub>Vg''. Setting these equal, we have\n\n:<math>mg = \\rho_\\mathrm{ref}Vg\\,</math>\n\nor just\n\n<!-- these nasty tables are the only way I can find to get the equation number to align properly. Something like <div align=\"right\">(2)</div> doesn't work properly. -->\n:{|cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 border=0 width=100%\n|-\n|<math>m = \\rho_\\mathrm{ref} V\\,</math>\n|style=\"text-align:right\"|(1)\n|}\n\nExactly the same equation applies when the hydrometer is floating in the liquid being measured, except that the new volume is ''V''&nbsp;-&nbsp;''A''\u0394''x'' (see note above about the sign of \u0394''x''). Thus,\n\n:{|cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 border=0 width=100%\n|-\n|<math>m = \\rho_\\mathrm{new} (V - A \\Delta x)\\,</math>\n|style=\"text-align:right\"|(2)\n|}\n\nCombining (1) and (2) yields\n\n:{|cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 border=0 width=100%\n|-\n|<math>RD_{\\mathrm{new/ref}} = \\frac{\\rho_\\mathrm{new}}{\\rho_\\mathrm{ref}} = \\frac{V}{V - A \\Delta x}</math>\n|style=\"text-align:right\"|(3)\n|}\n\nBut from (1) we have ''V'' = ''m''/''\u03c1''<sub>ref</sub>. Substituting into (3) gives\n\n:{|cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 border=0 width=100%\n|-\n|<math>RD_{\\mathrm{new/ref}} = \\frac{1}{1 - \\frac{A \\Delta x}{m} \\rho_\\mathrm{ref}}</math>\n|style=\"text-align:right\"|(4)\n|}\n\nThis equation allows the relative density to be calculated from the change in displacement, the known density of the reference liquid, and the known properties of the hydrometer. If \u0394''x'' is small then, as a [[Orders of approximation|first-order approximation]] of the [[geometric series]] equation (4) can be written as:\n\n:<math>RD_\\mathrm{new/ref} \\approx 1 + \\frac{A \\Delta x}{m} \\rho_\\mathrm{ref} </math>\n\nThis shows that, for small \u0394''x'', changes in displacement are approximately proportional to changes in relative density.\n\n===Pycnometer===\n[[File:PycnometerEmpty.jpg|thumb|upright|An empty glass pycnometer and stopper]]\n[[File:Pycnometer full.jpg|thumb|upright|A filled pycnometer]]\nA '''pycnometer''' (from [[Greek language|Greek]]: \u03c0\u03c5\u03ba\u03bd\u03cc\u03c2 (puknos) meaning \"dense\"), also called '''pyknometer''' or '''specific gravity bottle''', is a device used to determine the [[density]] of a liquid.  A pycnometer is usually made of [[glass]], with a close-fitting [[ground glass joint|ground glass]] [[stopper (plug)|stopper]] with a [[capillary tube]] through it, so that air bubbles may escape from the apparatus.  This device enables a liquid's density to be measured accurately by reference to an appropriate working fluid, such as [[water]] or [[Mercury (element)|mercury]], using an [[analytical balance]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}\n\nIf the flask is weighed empty, full of water, and full of a liquid whose relative density is desired, the relative density of the liquid can easily be calculated. The [[particle density (packed density)|particle density]] of a powder, to which the usual method of weighing cannot be applied, can also be determined with a pycnometer. The powder is added to the pycnometer, which is then weighed, giving the weight of the powder sample.  The pycnometer is then filled with a liquid of known density, in which the powder is completely insoluble.  The weight of the displaced liquid can then be determined, and hence the relative density of the powder.\n\nA [[gas pycnometer]], the gas-based manifestation of a pycnometer, compares the change in pressure caused by a measured change in a closed volume containing a reference (usually a steel sphere of known volume) with the change in pressure caused by the sample under the same conditions.  The difference in change of pressure represents the volume of the sample as compared to the reference sphere, and is usually used for solid particulates that may dissolve in the liquid medium of the pycnometer design described above, or for porous materials into which the liquid would not fully penetrate.\n\nWhen a pycnometer is filled to a specific, but not necessarily accurately known volume, ''V'' and is placed upon a balance, it will exert a force\n\n:<math> F_b = g(m_b - \\rho_a{m_b\\over \\rho_b}) </math>\n\nwhere ''m<sub>b</sub>'' is the mass of the bottle and ''g'' the [[gravitational acceleration]] at the location at which the measurements are being made. ''\u03c1''<sub>a</sub> is the density of the air at the ambient pressure and ''\u03c1''<sub>b</sub> is the density of the material of which the bottle is made (usually glass) so that the second term is the mass of air displaced by the glass of the bottle whose weight, by [[Archimedes' principle#Archimedes' principle|Archimedes Principle]] must be subtracted. The bottle is, of course, filled with air but as that air displaces an equal amount of air the weight of that air is canceled by the weight of the air displaced. Now we fill the bottle with the reference fluid e.g. pure water. The force exerted on the pan of the balance becomes:\n\n:<math> F_w = g(m_b - \\rho_a{m_b\\over \\rho_b} + V\\rho_w - V\\rho_a). </math>\n\nIf we subtract the force measured on the empty bottle from this (or tare the balance before making the water measurement) we obtain.\n\n:<math>F_{w,n} = gV( \\rho_w - \\rho_a) </math>\n\nwhere the subscript n indicated that this force is net of the force of the empty bottle. The bottle is now emptied, thoroughly dried and refilled with the sample. The force, net of the empty bottle, is now:\n\n:<math>F_{s,n} = gV(\\rho_s - \\rho_a) </math>\n\nwhere ''\u03c1''<sub>s</sub> is the density of the sample. The ratio of the sample and water forces is:\n\n:<math>SG_A = {gV(\\rho_s - \\rho_a) \\over gV( \\rho_w - \\rho_a)} = {( \\rho_s - \\rho_a) \\over ( \\rho_w - \\rho_a)}. </math>\n\nThis is called the Apparent Relative Density, denoted by subscript A, because it is what we would obtain if we took the ratio of net weighings in air from an analytical balance or used a [[hydrometer]] (the stem displaces air). Note that the result does not depend on the calibration of the balance. The only requirement on it is that it read linearly with force. Nor does ''RD<sub>A</sub>'' depend on the actual volume of the pycnometer.\n\nFurther manipulation and finally substitution of ''RD<sub>V</sub>'', the true relative density (the subscript V is used because this is often referred to as the relative density ''in vacuo''), for ''\u03c1''<sub>s</sub>/''\u03c1''<sub>w</sub> gives the relationship between apparent and true relative density.\n\n:<math>RD_A= {{\\rho_s \\over \\rho_w}-{\\rho_a \\over \\rho_w} \\over 1 - {\\rho_a \\over \\rho_w}} ={RD_V-{\\rho_a \\over \\rho_w} \\over 1 - {\\rho_a \\over \\rho_w}}</math>\n\nIn the usual case we will have measured weights and want the true relative density. This is found from\n\n:<math>RD_V = RD_A - {\\rho_a \\over \\rho_w }(RD_A-1)</math>\n\nSince the density of dry air at 101.325&nbsp;kPa at 20&nbsp;\u00b0C is<ref>DIN51 757 (04.1994): Testing of mineral oils and related materials; determination of density</ref> 0.001205 g/cm<sup>3</sup> and that of water is 0.998203 g/cm<sup>3</sup> we see that the difference between true and apparent relative densities for a substance with relative density (20&nbsp;\u00b0C/20&nbsp;\u00b0C) of about 1.100 would be 0.000120. Where the relative density of the sample is close to that of water (for example dilute ethanol solutions) the correction is even smaller.\n\nThe pycnometer is used in ISO standard: ISO 1183-1:2004, ISO 1014\u20131985 and [[ASTM International|ASTM]] standard: ASTM D854.\n\n'''Types'''\n\n* [[Gay-Lussac]], pear shaped, with perforated stopper, adjusted, capacity 1, 2, 5, 10, 25, 50 and 100 mL\n* as above, with ground-in [[thermometer]], adjusted, side tube with cap\n* Hubbard, for [[bitumen]] and [[heavy crude oil]]s, cylindrical type, [[ASTM]] D 70, 24 mL\n* as above, conical type, ASTM D 115 and D 234, 25 mL\n* Boot, with vacuum jacket and thermometer, capacity 5, 10, 25 and 50 mL\n\n===Digital density meters===\n''Hydrostatic Pressure-based Instruments'': This technology relies upon Pascal's Principle which states that the pressure difference between two points within a vertical column of fluid is dependent upon the vertical distance between the two points, the density of the fluid and the gravitational force. This technology is often used for tank gaging applications as a convenient means of liquid level and density measure.\n\n''Vibrating Element Transducers'': This type of instrument requires a vibrating element to be placed in contact with the fluid of interest. The resonant frequency of the element is measured and is related to the density of the fluid by a characterization that is dependent upon the design of the element. In modern laboratories precise measurements of relative density are made using [[oscillating U-tube]] meters. These are capable of measurement to 5 to 6 places beyond the decimal point and are used in the brewing, distilling, pharmaceutical, petroleum and other industries. The instruments measure the actual mass of fluid contained in a fixed volume at temperatures between 0 and 80&nbsp;\u00b0C but as they are microprocessor based can calculate apparent or true relative density and contain tables relating these to the strengths of common acids, sugar solutions, etc. The vibrating fork immersion probe is another good example of this technology. This technology also includes many coriolis-type mass flow meters which are widely used in chemical and petroleum industry for high accuracy mass flow measurement and can be configured to also output density information based on the resonant frequency of the vibrating flow tubes.<ref>{{cite web| url= https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/coriolis-flowmeter |via= sciencedirect.com | title=MPD with Flow Measurement as the Primary Control| first= Erdem |last= Catak| work= Managed Pressure Drilling| year= 2008  |access-date= July 10, 2019}}</ref>\n\n''Ultrasonic Transducer'': Ultrasonic waves are passed from a source, through the fluid of interest, and into a detector which measures the acoustic spectroscopy of the waves. Fluid properties such as density and viscosity can be inferred from the spectrum.\n\n''Radiation-based Gauge'': Radiation is passed from a source, through the fluid of interest, and into a scintillation detector, or counter. As the fluid density increases, the detected radiation \"counts\" will decrease. The source is typically the radioactive isotope [[cesium-137]], with a half-life of about 30 years. A key advantage for this technology is that the instrument is not required to be in contact with the fluid\u2014typically the source and detector are mounted on the outside of tanks or piping.<ref>[http://www.ohmartvega.com/en/nuclear_density_DSG.htm Density \u2013 VEGA Americas, Inc].

Retrieved on 2011-09-30.</ref>\n\n''Buoyant Force Transducer'': the buoyancy force produced by a float in a homogeneous liquid is equal to the weight of the liquid that is displaced by the float. Since buoyancy force is linear with respect to the density of the liquid within which the float is submerged, the measure of the buoyancy force yields a measure of the density of the liquid. One commercially available unit claims the instrument is capable of measuring relative density with an accuracy of \u00b1 0.005 RD units. The submersible probe head contains a mathematically characterized spring-float system. When the head is immersed vertically in the liquid, the float moves vertically and the position of the float controls the position of a permanent magnet whose displacement is sensed by a concentric array of Hall-effect linear displacement sensors. The output signals of the sensors are mixed in a dedicated electronics module that provides a single output voltage whose magnitude is a direct linear measure of the quantity to be measured.<ref>[http://www.gardco.com/pages/density/electric_hydrometer.cfm Process Control Digital Electronic Hydrometer].

Specific gravity for liquids is nearly always measured with respect to [[water (molecule)|water]] at its densest (at {{cvt|4|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|1|disp=or}}); for gases, air at [[room temperature]] ({{cvt|20|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|disp=or}}) is the reference. The term \"relative density\" is often preferred in scientific usage. It is defined as a ratio of density of particular substance with that of water.\n\nIf a substance's relative density is less than one then it is less dense than the reference; if greater than 1 then it is denser than the reference. If the relative density is exactly 1 then the densities are equal; that is, equal volumes of the two substances have the same mass.  If the reference material is water, then a substance with a relative density (or specific gravity) less than 1 will float in water. For example, an ice cube, with a relative density of about 0.91, will float. A substance with a relative density greater than 1 will sink.\n\nTemperature and pressure must be specified for both the sample and the reference. Pressure is nearly always 1 [[Atmosphere (unit)|atm]] (101.325 [[Pascal (unit)|kPa]]). Where it is not, it is more usual to specify the density directly. Temperatures for both sample and reference vary from industry to industry. In British brewing practice, the specific gravity, as specified above, is multiplied by 1000.<ref name=briggs>Hough, J.S., Briggs, D.E., Stevens, R and Young, T.W.

(By convention ''\u03c1'', the Greek letter [[Rho (letter)|rho]], denotes density.)\n\nThe reference material can be indicated using subscripts: ''RD''<sub>substance/reference</sub>, which means \"the relative density of ''substance'' with respect to ''reference''\". If the reference is not explicitly stated then it is normally assumed to be [[water]] at 4&nbsp;\u00b0[[Celsius|C]] (or, more precisely, 3.98&nbsp;\u00b0[[Celsius|C]], which is the temperature at which water reaches its maximum density). In [[International System of Units|SI]] units, the density of water is (approximately) 1000&nbsp;[[Kilogram|kg]]/[[Cubic metre|m<sup>3</sup>]] or 1&nbsp;[[Gram|g]]/[[Cubic centimetre|cm<sup>3</sup>]], which makes relative density calculations particularly convenient: the density of the object only needs to be divided by 1000 or 1, depending on the units.\n\nThe relative density of gases is often measured with respect to dry [[air]] at a temperature of 20&nbsp;\u00b0C and a pressure of 101.325 kPa absolute, which has a density of 1.205&nbsp;kg/m<sup>3</sup>. Relative density with respect to air can be obtained by\n\n:<math>\n\\mathit{RD} = \\frac{\\rho_\\mathrm{gas}}{\\rho_{\\mathrm{air}}} \\approx \\frac{M_\\mathrm{gas}}{M_{\\mathrm{air}}}\n</math>\n\nWhere ''M'' is the [[molar mass]] and the approximately equal sign is used because equality pertains only if 1 [[Mole (unit)|mol]] of the gas and 1&nbsp;mol of air occupy the same volume at a given temperature and pressure i.e. they are both [[Ideal gas]]es. Ideal behaviour is usually only seen at very low pressure. For example, one mol of an ideal gas occupies 22.414 L at 0&nbsp;\u00b0C and 1 atmosphere whereas [[carbon dioxide]] has a molar volume of 22.259 L under those same conditions.\n\nThose with SG greater than 1 are denser than water and will, disregarding [[surface tension]] effects, sink in it. Those with an SG less than 1 are less dense than water and will float on it. In scientific work, the relationship of mass to volume is usually expressed directly in terms of the density (mass per unit volume) of the substance under study. It is in industry where specific gravity finds wide application, often for historical reasons.\n\nTrue specific gravity of a liquid can be expressed mathematically as:\n\n:<math> SG_\\text{true} = \\frac {\\rho_\\text{sample}}{\\rho_\\mathrm{H_2O}}</math>\n\nwhere ''\u03c1''<sub>sample</sub> is the density of the sample and ''\u03c1''<sub>H<sub>2</sub>O</sub> is the density of water.\n\nThe apparent specific gravity is simply the ratio of the weights of equal volumes of sample and water in air:\n\n:<math> SG_\\text{apparent} = \\frac {W_{\\mathrm{A},\\text{sample}}}{W_{\\mathrm{A},\\mathrm{H_2O}}} </math>\n\nwhere ''W''<sub>A,sample</sub> represents the weight of the sample measured in air and ''W''<sub>A,H<sub>2</sub>O</sub> the weight of an equal volume of water  measured in air.\n\nIt can be shown that true specific gravity can be computed from different properties:\n\n:<math> SG_\\text{true} = \\frac {\\rho_\\text{sample}}{\\rho_\\mathrm{H_2O}} = \\frac {\\frac{m_\\text{sample}}{V}}{\\frac{m_\\mathrm{H_2O}}{V}} = \\frac {m_\\text{sample}}{m_\\mathrm{H_2O}} \\frac{g}{g} = \\frac {W_{\\mathrm{V},\\text{sample}}}{W_{\\mathrm{V},\\mathrm{H_2O}}} </math> \n\nwhere ''g'' is the local acceleration due to gravity, ''V'' is the volume of the sample and of water (the same for both), ''\u03c1''<sub>sample</sub> is the density of the sample, ''\u03c1''<sub>H<sub>2</sub>O</sub> is the density of water, ''W''<sub>V</sub> represents a weight obtained in vacuum, <math>\\mathit{m}_{\\text{sample}}</math> is the mass of the sample and <math>\\mathit{m}_{\\text{H}_{2}\\text{O}}</math>is the mass of an equal volume of water.\n\nThe density of water varies with temperature and pressure as does the density of the sample. So it is necessary to specify the temperatures and pressures at which the densities or weights were determined. It is nearly always the case that measurements are made at 1 nominal atmosphere (101.325&nbsp;kPa \u00b1 variations from changing weather patterns). But as specific gravity usually refers to highly incompressible aqueous solutions or other incompressible substances (such as petroleum products), variations in density caused by pressure are usually neglected at least where apparent specific gravity is being measured. For true (''in vacuo'') specific gravity calculations, air pressure must be considered (see below). Temperatures are specified by the notation (''T''<sub>s</sub>/''T''<sub>r</sub>), with ''T''<sub>s</sub> representing the temperature at which the sample's density was determined and ''T''<sub>r</sub> the temperature at which the reference (water) density is specified. For example, SG (20&nbsp;\u00b0C/4&nbsp;\u00b0C) would be understood to mean that the density of the sample was determined at 20&nbsp;\u00b0C and of the water at 4&nbsp;\u00b0C. Taking into account different sample and reference temperatures, we note that, while ''SG''<sub>H<sub>2</sub>O</sub> = {{val|1.000000}} (20&nbsp;\u00b0C/20&nbsp;\u00b0C), it is also the case that ''SG''<sub>H<sub>2</sub>O</sub> = {{frac|{{val|0.998203}}|{{val|0.999840}}}} = {{val|0.998363}} (20&nbsp;\u00b0C/4&nbsp;\u00b0C).

In the sugar, soft drink, honey, fruit juice and related industries, sucrose concentration by weight is taken from a table prepared by [[Brix|A. Brix]], which uses SG (17.5&nbsp;\u00b0C/17.5&nbsp;\u00b0C). As a final example, the British SG units are based on reference and sample temperatures of 60&nbsp;\u00b0F and are thus (15.56&nbsp;\u00b0C/15.56&nbsp;\u00b0C).\n\nGiven the specific gravity of a substance, its actual density can be calculated by rearranging the above formula:\n\n:<math>{\\rho_\\text{substance}} = SG \\times \\rho_\\mathrm{H_2O}.</math>\n\nOccasionally a reference substance other than water is specified (for example, air), in which case specific gravity means density relative to that reference.\n\n==Temperature dependence==\n:''See [[Density]] for a table of the measured densities of water at various temperatures.''\n\nThe density of substances varies with temperature and pressure so that it is necessary to specify the temperatures and pressures at which the densities or masses were determined. It is nearly always the case that measurements are made at nominally 1 atmosphere (101.325&nbsp;kPa ignoring the variations caused by changing weather patterns) but as relative density usually refers to highly incompressible aqueous solutions or other incompressible substances (such as petroleum products) variations in density caused by pressure are usually neglected at least where apparent relative density is being measured. For true (''in vacuo'') relative density calculations air pressure must be considered (see below). Temperatures are specified by the notation (''T<sub>s</sub>''/''T<sub>r</sub>'') with ''T<sub>s</sub>'' representing the temperature at which the sample's density was determined and ''T<sub>r</sub>'' the temperature at which the reference (water) density is specified.

Relative density is often used by [[Geology|geologists]] and [[Mineralogy|mineralogists]] to help determine the [[mineral]] content of a rock or other sample. [[Gemology|Gemologists]] use it as an aid in the identification of [[gemstone]]s. Water is preferred as the reference because measurements are then easy to carry out in the field (see below for examples of measurement methods).\n\nAs the principal use of relative density measurements in industry is determination of the concentrations of substances in aqueous solutions and these are found in tables of RD vs concentration it is extremely important that the analyst enter the table with the correct form of relative density. For example, in the brewing industry, the [[Plato scale|Plato table]], which lists sucrose concentration by mass against true RD, were originally (20&nbsp;\u00b0C/4&nbsp;\u00b0C)<ref>ASBC Methods of Analysis Preface to Table 1: Extract in Wort and Beer, American Society of Brewing Chemists, St Paul, 2009</ref> that is based on measurements of the density of sucrose solutions made at laboratory temperature (20&nbsp;\u00b0C) but referenced to the density of water at 4&nbsp;\u00b0C which is very close to the temperature at which water has its maximum density of ''\u03c1''({{chem|H|2|O}}) equal to 0.999972&nbsp;g/cm<sup>3</sup> (or 62.43&nbsp;lb\u00b7ft<sup>\u22123</sup>).

In the sugar, soft drink, honey, fruit juice and related industries sucrose concentration by mass is taken from this work<ref name=briggs/> which uses SG (17.5&nbsp;\u00b0C/17.5&nbsp;\u00b0C). As a final example, the British RD units are based on reference and sample temperatures of 60&nbsp;\u00b0F and are thus (15.56&nbsp;\u00b0C/15.56&nbsp;\u00b0C).<ref name=briggs/>\n\n==Measurement==\nRelative density can be calculated directly by measuring the density of a sample and dividing it by the (known) density of the reference substance. The density of the sample is simply its mass divided by its volume. Although mass is easy to measure, the volume of an irregularly shaped sample can be more difficult to ascertain. One method is to put the sample in a water-filled [[graduated cylinder]] and read off how much water it displaces. Alternatively the container can be filled to the brim, the sample immersed, and the volume of overflow measured. The [[surface tension]] of the water may keep a significant amount of water from overflowing, which is especially problematic for small samples. For this reason it is desirable to use a water container with as small a mouth as possible.\n\nFor each substance, the density, ''\u03c1'', is given by\n\n:<math>\\rho = \\frac{\\text{Mass}}{\\text{Volume}}\n = \\frac{\\text{Deflection} \\times \\frac{\\text{Spring Constant}}{\\text{Gravity}}}{\\text{Displacement}_\\mathrm{Water Line} \\times \\text{Area}_\\mathrm{Cylinder}}\\,\n</math>\n\nWhen these densities are divided, references to the spring constant, gravity and cross-sectional area simply cancel, leaving\n\n:<math>\nRD=\\frac{\\rho_\\mathrm{object}}{\\rho_\\mathrm{ref}}\n= \\frac{\\frac{\\text{Deflection}_\\mathrm{Obj.}}{\\text{Displacement}_\\mathrm{Obj.}}}{\\frac{\\text{Deflection}_\\mathrm{Ref.}}{\\text{Displacement}_\\mathrm{Ref.}}}\n = \\frac{\\frac{3\\ \\mathrm{in}}{20\\ \\mathrm{mm}}}{\\frac{5\\ \\mathrm{in}}{34\\ \\mathrm{mm}}}=\\frac{3\\ \\mathrm{in} \\times 34\\ \\mathrm{mm}}{5\\ \\mathrm{in} \\times 20\\ \\mathrm{mm}} = 1.02\\,\n</math>\n\n===Hydrostatic weighing===\n{{main article|Hydrostatic weighing}}\nRelative density is more easily and perhaps more accurately measured without measuring volume. Using a spring scale, the sample is weighed first in air and then in water. Relative density (with respect to water) can then be calculated using the following formula:\n\n:<math>\nRD = \\frac{W_\\mathrm{air}}{W_\\mathrm{air} - W_\\mathrm{water}}\n</math>\n\nwhere\n:''W''<sub>air</sub> is the weight of the sample in air (measured in [[newton (unit)|newton]]s, [[pound-force|pounds-force]] or some other unit of force)\n:''W''<sub>water</sub> is the weight of the sample in water (measured in the same units).\n\nThis technique cannot easily be used to measure relative densities less than one, because the sample will then float. ''W''<sub>water</sub> becomes a negative quantity, representing the force needed to keep the sample underwater.\n\nAnother practical method uses three measurements. The sample is weighed dry. Then a container filled to the brim with water is weighed, and weighed again with the sample immersed, after the displaced water has overflowed and been removed. Subtracting the last reading from the sum of the first two readings gives the weight of the displaced water. The relative density result is the dry sample weight divided by that of the displaced water. This method works with scales that can't easily accommodate a suspended sample, and also allows for measurement of samples that are less dense than water.\n\n===Hydrometer===\n{{main article|hydrometer}}\n[[File:Hydro.PNG|right|300px]]\nThe relative density of a liquid can be measured using a hydrometer. This consists of a bulb attached to a stalk of constant cross-sectional area, as shown in the adjacent diagram.\n\nFirst the hydrometer is floated in the reference liquid (shown in light blue), and the [[displacement (fluid)|displacement]] (the level of the liquid on the stalk) is marked (blue line). The reference could be any liquid, but in practice it is usually water.\n\nThe hydrometer is then floated in a liquid of unknown density (shown in green). The change in displacement, \u0394''x'', is noted. In the example depicted, the hydrometer has dropped slightly in the green liquid; hence its density is lower than that of the reference liquid. It is, of course, necessary that the hydrometer floats in both liquids.\n\nThe application of simple physical principles allows the relative density of the unknown liquid to be calculated from the change in displacement. (In practice the stalk of the hydrometer is pre-marked with graduations to facilitate this measurement.)\n\nIn the explanation that follows,\n\n:'''''\u03c1<sub>ref</sub>''''' is the known density ([[mass]] per unit [[volume]]) of the reference liquid (typically water).\n:'''''\u03c1<sub>new</sub>''' is the unknown density of the new (green) liquid.\n:'''''RD''<sub>new/ref</sub>''' is the relative density of the new liquid with respect to the reference.\n:'''''V''''' is the volume of reference liquid displaced, i.e. the red volume in the diagram.\n:'''''m''''' is the mass of the entire hydrometer.\n:'''''g''''' is the [[Earth's gravity|local gravitational constant]].\n:'''''\u0394x''''' is the change in displacement. In accordance with the way in which hydrometers are usually graduated, \u0394''x'' is here taken to be negative if the displacement line rises on the stalk of the hydrometer, and positive if it falls. In the example depicted, \u0394''x'' is negative.\n:'''''A''''' is the cross sectional area of the shaft.\n\nSince the floating hydrometer is in [[static equilibrium]], the downward gravitational force acting upon it must exactly balance the upward buoyancy force. The gravitational force acting on the hydrometer is simply its weight, ''mg''. From the [[Archimedes]] [[buoyancy]] principle, the buoyancy force acting on the hydrometer is equal to the weight of liquid displaced. This weight is equal to the mass of liquid displaced multiplied by ''g'', which in the case of the reference liquid is ''\u03c1<sub>ref</sub>Vg''. Setting these equal, we have\n\n:<math>mg = \\rho_\\mathrm{ref}Vg\\,</math>\n\nor just\n\n<!-- these nasty tables are the only way I can find to get the equation number to align properly. Something like <div align=\"right\">(2)</div> doesn't work properly. -->\n:{|cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 border=0 width=100%\n|-\n|<math>m = \\rho_\\mathrm{ref} V\\,</math>\n|style=\"text-align:right\"|(1)\n|}\n\nExactly the same equation applies when the hydrometer is floating in the liquid being measured, except that the new volume is ''V''&nbsp;-&nbsp;''A''\u0394''x'' (see note above about the sign of \u0394''x''). Thus,\n\n:{|cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 border=0 width=100%\n|-\n|<math>m = \\rho_\\mathrm{new} (V - A \\Delta x)\\,</math>\n|style=\"text-align:right\"|(2)\n|}\n\nCombining (1) and (2) yields\n\n:{|cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 border=0 width=100%\n|-\n|<math>RD_{\\mathrm{new/ref}} = \\frac{\\rho_\\mathrm{new}}{\\rho_\\mathrm{ref}} = \\frac{V}{V - A \\Delta x}</math>\n|style=\"text-align:right\"|(3)\n|}\n\nBut from (1) we have ''V'' = ''m''/''\u03c1''<sub>ref</sub>. Substituting into (3) gives\n\n:{|cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 border=0 width=100%\n|-\n|<math>RD_{\\mathrm{new/ref}} = \\frac{1}{1 - \\frac{A \\Delta x}{m} \\rho_\\mathrm{ref}}</math>\n|style=\"text-align:right\"|(4)\n|}\n\nThis equation allows the relative density to be calculated from the change in displacement, the known density of the reference liquid, and the known properties of the hydrometer. If \u0394''x'' is small then, as a [[Orders of approximation|first-order approximation]] of the [[geometric series]] equation (4) can be written as:\n\n:<math>RD_\\mathrm{new/ref} \\approx 1 + \\frac{A \\Delta x}{m} \\rho_\\mathrm{ref} </math>\n\nThis shows that, for small \u0394''x'', changes in displacement are approximately proportional to changes in relative density.\n\n===Pycnometer===\n[[File:PycnometerEmpty.jpg|thumb|upright|An empty glass pycnometer and stopper]]\n[[File:Pycnometer full.jpg|thumb|upright|A filled pycnometer]]\nA '''pycnometer''' (from [[Greek language|Greek]]: \u03c0\u03c5\u03ba\u03bd\u03cc\u03c2 (puknos) meaning \"dense\"), also called '''pyknometer''' or '''specific gravity bottle''', is a device used to determine the [[density]] of a liquid.  A pycnometer is usually made of [[glass]], with a close-fitting [[ground glass joint|ground glass]] [[stopper (plug)|stopper]] with a [[capillary tube]] through it, so that air bubbles may escape from the apparatus.  This device enables a liquid's density to be measured accurately by reference to an appropriate working fluid, such as [[water]] or [[Mercury (element)|mercury]], using an [[analytical balance]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}\n\nIf the flask is weighed empty, full of water, and full of a liquid whose relative density is desired, the relative density of the liquid can easily be calculated. The [[particle density (packed density)|particle density]] of a powder, to which the usual method of weighing cannot be applied, can also be determined with a pycnometer. The powder is added to the pycnometer, which is then weighed, giving the weight of the powder sample.  The pycnometer is then filled with a liquid of known density, in which the powder is completely insoluble.  The weight of the displaced liquid can then be determined, and hence the relative density of the powder.\n\nA [[gas pycnometer]], the gas-based manifestation of a pycnometer, compares the change in pressure caused by a measured change in a closed volume containing a reference (usually a steel sphere of known volume) with the change in pressure caused by the sample under the same conditions.  The difference in change of pressure represents the volume of the sample as compared to the reference sphere, and is usually used for solid particulates that may dissolve in the liquid medium of the pycnometer design described above, or for porous materials into which the liquid would not fully penetrate.\n\nWhen a pycnometer is filled to a specific, but not necessarily accurately known volume, ''V'' and is placed upon a balance, it will exert a force\n\n:<math> F_b = g(m_b - \\rho_a{m_b\\over \\rho_b}) </math>\n\nwhere ''m<sub>b</sub>'' is the mass of the bottle and ''g'' the [[gravitational acceleration]] at the location at which the measurements are being made. ''\u03c1''<sub>a</sub> is the density of the air at the ambient pressure and ''\u03c1''<sub>b</sub> is the density of the material of which the bottle is made (usually glass) so that the second term is the mass of air displaced by the glass of the bottle whose weight, by [[Archimedes' principle#Archimedes' principle|Archimedes Principle]] must be subtracted. The bottle is, of course, filled with air but as that air displaces an equal amount of air the weight of that air is canceled by the weight of the air displaced. Now we fill the bottle with the reference fluid e.g. pure water. The force exerted on the pan of the balance becomes:\n\n:<math> F_w = g(m_b - \\rho_a{m_b\\over \\rho_b} + V\\rho_w - V\\rho_a). </math>\n\nIf we subtract the force measured on the empty bottle from this (or tare the balance before making the water measurement) we obtain.\n\n:<math>F_{w,n} = gV( \\rho_w - \\rho_a) </math>\n\nwhere the subscript n indicated that this force is net of the force of the empty bottle. The bottle is now emptied, thoroughly dried and refilled with the sample. The force, net of the empty bottle, is now:\n\n:<math>F_{s,n} = gV(\\rho_s - \\rho_a) </math>\n\nwhere ''\u03c1''<sub>s</sub> is the density of the sample. The ratio of the sample and water forces is:\n\n:<math>SG_A = {gV(\\rho_s - \\rho_a) \\over gV( \\rho_w - \\rho_a)} = {( \\rho_s - \\rho_a) \\over ( \\rho_w - \\rho_a)}. </math>\n\nThis is called the Apparent Relative Density, denoted by subscript A, because it is what we would obtain if we took the ratio of net weighings in air from an analytical balance or used a [[hydrometer]] (the stem displaces air). Note that the result does not depend on the calibration of the balance. The only requirement on it is that it read linearly with force. Nor does ''RD<sub>A</sub>'' depend on the actual volume of the pycnometer.\n\nFurther manipulation and finally substitution of ''RD<sub>V</sub>'', the true relative density (the subscript V is used because this is often referred to as the relative density ''in vacuo''), for ''\u03c1''<sub>s</sub>/''\u03c1''<sub>w</sub> gives the relationship between apparent and true relative density.\n\n:<math>RD_A= {{\\rho_s \\over \\rho_w}-{\\rho_a \\over \\rho_w} \\over 1 - {\\rho_a \\over \\rho_w}} ={RD_V-{\\rho_a \\over \\rho_w} \\over 1 - {\\rho_a \\over \\rho_w}}</math>\n\nIn the usual case we will have measured weights and want the true relative density. This is found from\n\n:<math>RD_V = RD_A - {\\rho_a \\over \\rho_w }(RD_A-1)</math>\n\nSince the density of dry air at 101.325&nbsp;kPa at 20&nbsp;\u00b0C is<ref>DIN51 757 (04.1994): Testing of mineral oils and related materials; determination of density</ref> 0.001205 g/cm<sup>3</sup> and that of water is 0.998203 g/cm<sup>3</sup> we see that the difference between true and apparent relative densities for a substance with relative density (20&nbsp;\u00b0C/20&nbsp;\u00b0C) of about 1.100 would be 0.000120. Where the relative density of the sample is close to that of water (for example dilute ethanol solutions) the correction is even smaller.\n\nThe pycnometer is used in ISO standard: ISO 1183-1:2004, ISO 1014\u20131985 and [[ASTM International|ASTM]] standard: ASTM D854.\n\n'''Types'''\n\n* [[Gay-Lussac]], pear shaped, with perforated stopper, adjusted, capacity 1, 2, 5, 10, 25, 50 and 100 mL\n* as above, with ground-in [[thermometer]], adjusted, side tube with cap\n* Hubbard, for [[bitumen]] and [[heavy crude oil]]s, cylindrical type, [[ASTM]] D 70, 24 mL\n* as above, conical type, ASTM D 115 and D 234, 25 mL\n* Boot, with vacuum jacket and thermometer, capacity 5, 10, 25 and 50 mL\n\n===Digital density meters===\n''Hydrostatic Pressure-based Instruments'': This technology relies upon Pascal's Principle which states that the pressure difference between two points within a vertical column of fluid is dependent upon the vertical distance between the two points, the density of the fluid and the gravitational force. This technology is often used for tank gaging applications as a convenient means of liquid level and density measure.\n\n''Vibrating Element Transducers'': This type of instrument requires a vibrating element to be placed in contact with the fluid of interest. The resonant frequency of the element is measured and is related to the density of the fluid by a characterization that is dependent upon the design of the element. In modern laboratories precise measurements of relative density are made using [[oscillating U-tube]] meters. These are capable of measurement to 5 to 6 places beyond the decimal point and are used in the brewing, distilling, pharmaceutical, petroleum and other industries. The instruments measure the actual mass of fluid contained in a fixed volume at temperatures between 0 and 80&nbsp;\u00b0C but as they are microprocessor based can calculate apparent or true relative density and contain tables relating these to the strengths of common acids, sugar solutions, etc. The vibrating fork immersion probe is another good example of this technology. This technology also includes many coriolis-type mass flow meters which are widely used in chemical and petroleum industry for high accuracy mass flow measurement and can be configured to also output density information based on the resonant frequency of the vibrating flow tubes.<ref>{{cite web| url= https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/coriolis-flowmeter |via= sciencedirect.com | title=MPD with Flow Measurement as the Primary Control| first= Erdem |last= Catak| work= Managed Pressure Drilling| year= 2008  |access-date= July 10, 2019}}</ref>\n\n''Ultrasonic Transducer'': Ultrasonic waves are passed from a source, through the fluid of interest, and into a detector which measures the acoustic spectroscopy of the waves.

Since buoyancy force is linear with respect to the density of the liquid within which the float is submerged, the measure of the buoyancy force yields a measure of the density of the liquid. One commercially available unit claims the instrument is capable of measuring relative density with an accuracy of \u00b1 0.005 RD units. The submersible probe head contains a mathematically characterized spring-float system. When the head is immersed vertically in the liquid, the float moves vertically and the position of the float controls the position of a permanent magnet whose displacement is sensed by a concentric array of Hall-effect linear displacement sensors.
