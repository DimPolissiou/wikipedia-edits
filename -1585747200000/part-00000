It stars [[Poulomi Das]] who plays the role of a girl who has a dusky complexion who has to fight the social norm of not being fair-skinned in India. \n\n'''The show is currently halted due to the [[COVID-19]].'''\n\n==Summary==\nKartik likes a girl after seeing her selflessness but Kartik's mother does not like the girl because of her complexion. \n\n==Plot==\nPurnima was treated unfairly from a young age because of her dark complexion. One day, young Purnima gives her trophy for student of the year to her step-sister, Shanaya, but is later caught as someone comes from her school revealing the truth. Purnima's father always stands for Purnima and asks Shanaya to apologise but she refuses. Later, her step-mother, who prefers her daughter, abandons young Purnima at the Golden Temple. In search of her mother, young Purnima meets young Kartik who gives her a bracelet saying the bracelet will give her protection. Kartik's mother gets angry as her son is talking to a girl of dark complexion and middle-class. Purnima, nonetheless, reaches home and takes the blame of being a butterfly. Her father talks to her about how the way you act matters more than the colour of someone's skin complexion. \n\n16 years later, Purnima and Kartik are now adults. Kartik is a doctor who loves volunteering at the temple's footwear storage. While taking Purnima's footwear, he notices the bracelet. Kartik's mother, Soni, hates dark complexion as she is the owner of a fairness beauty brand and wishes for a fairy-like girl, fair complexion is a must. Purnima prays for her sister who is taking part in Miss Amritsar beauty. Purnima calls Shanaya and gives her a definition of beauty that was given to her by her father. Kartik overhears Purnima while he is consulting a patient and gets impressed by her thoughtfulness. Like the Arora sisters, the Mehra brothers have different definitions of beauty. When questioned by Soni, a judge at the show, Shanaya gives the exacts same words Purnima told her. Kartik realises the similarity and concludes that Purnima might be nearby. Soni chooses Shanaya as her future daughter-in-law. Some time later, Kartik spots Purnima who was with her other family members. Soni sees her son and asks him what he was looking at. He points where and Soni sees Shanaya.\n\nNext morning, Soni and Sumreet (Kartik's brother) express their choices that match, both being Shanaya. Soni also plans on making Shanaya face for the company's new product. A boy comes for a marriage proposal for Purnima but they reject her for her complexion. Shanaya needs money for another contest, Miss Punjab. Shanaya steals Purnima's money which the latter collected since childhood. Shanaya gets caught as one of her nails gets found near Purnima's belongings but she has already used the stolen things for her next contest. \n\nPurnima finds a small girl hurt on the road and the people surrounding the little kid are of no help, some shooting videos. Purnima sacrifices her school fees for the girl and donates some of her blood to her. Purnima bumps into Soni and Soni is disgusted. Soni sends a marriage proposal for Shanaya. Shanaya tells her mother that she does not like the idea of marriage. Shanaya misunderstands the groom as only the two brothers are sent there. Her choice is Kartik and not Sumreet. \n\n==Cast==\n===Main===\n* [[Poulomi Das]] as Purnima Arora\n* Harsh Nagar as Kartik Mehra\n* Kavita Ghai as Soni Mehra, Kartik's mother\n\n===Recurring===\n'''''Surrounding Purnima'''''\n* Purnima's father\n* Purnima's grandmother\n* Beena, Purnima's step-mother\n* Shanaya's grandmother\n* Nidhi Shah as Shanaya Arora / Shanu, Purnima's step-sister\n\n\n'''''Surrounding Kartik'''''\n* Mohit Chauhan as Kartik's father\n* [[Shraddha Jaiswal]] as Bably, Kartik's aunt\n* Twinkle Mehra, Kartik's cousin\n* Sumreet Mehra, Kartik's cousin\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n[[Category:2019 Indian television series debuts]]\n[[Category:2010s Indian television series]]\n[[Category:Hindi-language television programs]]\n[[Category:Indian mythological television series]]\n[[Category:Indian television soap operas]]\n[[Category:Star Bharat television series]]\n\n== External links ==\n", "text_old": "{{Use dmy dates|date=April 2020}}\n{{Use Indian English|date=April 2020}}\n{{Infobox television\n| show_name                = Kartik Purnima\n| image                    = \n| genre                    = [[Drama]] ,[[Romance]]\n| channel                  = [[Star Bharat]]\n| creator                  = Bhupinder Singh,  Sanjot Kaur\n| based_on                 = \n| writer                   = Pearl Gray, Raghuvir Shekhawat, Lakshmi Jaykumar\n| director                 = Ravid Gautam\n| creative_director        = \n| starring                 = \n| theme_music_composer     = \n| opentheme                = \n| country                  = [[India]]\n| language                 = [[Hindi language| Hindi]], [[Punjabi language| Punjabi]]\n| num_seasons              = 1\n| num_episodes             = 45 (as of 27 March 2020)\n| producer                 = \n| location                 = \n| cinematography           = \n| camera                   = [[Multi-camera]]\n| runtime                  = \n| company                  = \n| distributor              = [[Star India]]\n| picture_format           = \n| first_aired              = {{start date|df=yes|2020|2|03}}\n| last_aired               = present\n| website            = https://www.hotstar.com/in/tv/kartik-purnima/s-2481\n| production_website = \n}}\n\n'''''Kartik Purnima''''' is an Indian Hindi-language social drama television series, which premiered on 3rd February 2020 on [[Star Bharat]].

It was released in January 1976 as the title track and opener of his tenth studio album ''[[Station to Station]]'', as well as on a promotional [[Gramophone record|7-inch single]] in France the same month. Co-produced by Bowie and [[Harry Maslin]], it was written and recorded at [[Cherokee Studios]] in Los Angeles between September and November 1975. At over 10 minutes in length, it is Bowie's longest studio recording. Opening with a train-like noise, the song's first half is a slow march, built around an atonal guitar riff, while the second half takes the form of a [[Progressive rock|prog]]-[[disco]] suite that's in a different key and tempo than the first. The song dabbles in [[art rock]] and is influenced by the German electronic bands [[Kraftwerk]] and [[Tangerine Dream]].\n\nLyrically, the song introduces Bowie's sinister persona [[the Thin White Duke]], who became the mouthpiece for ''Station to Station'' and, throughout 1976, often the embodiment of Bowie himself. During the recording, Bowie was heavily dependent on drugs such as [[cocaine]], which is referenced directly throughout the song. \"Station to Station\" also makes references to the [[Kabbalah]], [[occultism]], [[gnosticism]], [[paranoia]] and other fixations that affected Bowie's mind at the time. The opening sound effect is a [[red herring]] meant to represent the [[Stations of the Cross]], along with a juncture connecting two different stages of his career; it combined the [[funk]] and [[Soul music|soul]] of his previous album ''[[Young Americans]]'' with the experimental sound he would take on his [[Berlin Trilogy]].\n\n\"Station to Station\" has received acclaim from music critics, who have praised the performance of the band and Bowie himself. Retrospectively, it has been named one of Bowie's greatest songs and, like its parent album, is seen as the indicator of where Bowie's career was heading at the time. He performed the track throughout the [[Isolar \u2013 1976 Tour|1976 Isolar Tour]], often in character as the Thin White Duke, and continued to perform it on different tours throughout his career.

Froese's 1975 album ''[[Epsilon in Malaysian Pale]]'' also begins with a train sound effect.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=468}} However, he notes that the train is a [[red herring]] in that it expresses what Bowie later called \"the album's 'wayward spiritual search'.\"{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=468}} More specifically, it reinstates the \"travelling metaphor\" of earlier compositions: \"the stations recall the 'new surroundings' of \"[[Rock 'n' Roll with Me]]\" [from ''[[Diamond Dogs]]''], and the \"mountains on mountains\" reprise the questing motifs of \"[[Wild Eyed Boy from Freecloud]]\" [from ''[[David Bowie (1969 album)|David Bowie]]'' (1969)] and ''[[The Man Who Sold the World]]''.\"{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=468}} Bowie would later state, \"the \"Station to Station\" track itself is very much concerned with the [[Stations of the Cross]],\"<ref name=Q97X /> the sequence of 14 landmarks on [[Jesus|Christ]]'s path to the [[Crucifixion of Jesus|crucifixion]], each a symbolic stopping-point for prayer.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=468}} Stuart Berman of ''[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]'' supports this, stating: \"the title track's momentous prog-disco suite [...] charts a course from spiritual void toward ecstatic religious reawakening.\"<ref name=\"Berman Pitchfork\">{{cite web|last=Berman|first=Stuart|url=http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14687-station-to-station-deluxe-edition/|title=David Bowie: ''Station to Station'' (Deluxe Edition)|work=[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]|date=29 September 2010|accessdate=22 October 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101021073153/http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14687-station-to-station-deluxe-edition/|archive-date=21 October 2010|url-status=live}}</ref> Another possible influence is guitarist [[Jimmy Page]] of the English rock band [[Led Zeppelin]]. Page was a session musician on Bowie's earliest recordings and had been an occasional acquaintance ever since.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=469}} During the same time Bowie became dependant on cocaine, Page had become dependant on [[heroin]] which, according to Pegg, was \"even more fearful\" than Bowie's addiction.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=469}} Led Zeppelin's ''[[Physical Graffiti]]'' was released in March 1975,<ref>{{cite AV media notes|title=Physical Graffiti|others=[[Led Zeppelin]]|year=1975|publisher=[[Swan Song Records]]|location=UK|type=liner notes|id=SSK 894007}}</ref> months ahead of the ''Station to Station'' sessions.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=469}} Pegg writes: \"It's possible to discern in [\"Station to Station\"] a distinct flavour of the groove, tempo and sense of building tension created by the famous rising riff of ''Physical Graffiti''<nowiki/>'s standout track '[[Kashmir (song)|Kashmir]]'\", an epic track that evokes a \"troubled spiritual journey\" through its music and lyrics.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=469}}\n\n==Lyrics==\n[[File:The Thin White Duke 76.jpg|thumb|160px|left|alt=David Bowie performing in 1976 and in character as the Thin White Duke|Bowie in character as the Thin White Duke performing on the [[Isolar \u2013 1976 Tour|1976 Isolar Tour]].]]\n\"Station to Station\" introduces Bowie's persona [[the Thin White Duke]], a sinister figure who became the mouthpiece for ''Station to Station'' and, often throughout 1976, for Bowie himself.<ref>{{cite web |last=Light |first=Alan |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-features/how-david-bowie-brought-thin-white-duke-to-life-on-station-to-station-125797/ |title=How David Bowie Brought Thin White Duke to Life on 'Station to Station' |work=[[Rolling Stone]] |accessdate=26 December 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181227040904/https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-features/how-david-bowie-brought-thin-white-duke-to-life-on-station-to-station-125797/ |archive-date=27 December 2018 |url-status=live }}</ref>{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=467}} The persona was noticeably darker than Bowie's previous characters, being described as \"a mad aristocrat\",{{sfn|Carr|Murray|1981|pp=78\u201380}} an \"amoral zombie\",{{sfn|Buckley|2000|p=258}} and \"an emotionless ''[[Aryan race|Aryan]]'' superman\".{{sfn|Pegg|2004|pp=297\u2013300}} For Bowie himself, the Duke was \"a nasty character indeed\".{{sfn|Wilcken|2005|p=24}} The lyrics themselves contain very cryptic messages.

It was released in January 1976 as the title track and opener of his tenth studio album ''[[Station to Station]]'' as well as on a promotional [[Gramophone record|7-inch single]] in France the same month. Co-produced by Bowie and [[Harry Maslin]], it was written and recorded at [[Cherokee Studios]] in Los Angeles between September and November 1975. At over 10 minutes in length, it is Bowie's longest studio recording. Opening with a train-like noise, the song's first half is a slow march, built around an atonal guitar riff, while the second half takes the form of a [[Progressive rock|prog]]-[[disco]] suite that's in a different key and tempo than the first. The song dabbles in [[art rock]], and is influenced by the German electronic bands [[Kraftwerk]] and [[Tangerine Dream]].\n\nLyrically, the song introduces Bowie's sinister persona [[the Thin White Duke]], who became the mouthpiece for ''Station to Station'' and, throughout 1976, often the embodiment of Bowie himself. During the recording, Bowie was heavily dependent on drugs such as [[cocaine]], which is referenced directly throughout. The song also makes references to the [[Kabbalah]], [[occultism]], [[gnosticism]], [[paranoia]] and other fixations that affected Bowie's mind at the time. The opening sound effect is a [[red herring]] meant to represent the [[Stations of the Cross]], along with a juncture connecting two different stages of his career; it combined the [[funk]] and [[Soul music|soul]] of his previous album ''[[Young Americans]]'' with the experimental sound he would take on his [[Berlin Trilogy]].\n\n\"Station to Station\" has received acclaim from music critics, who have praised the performance of the band and Bowie himself. Retrospectively, it has been named one of Bowie's greatest songs and, like its parent album, is seen as the indicator of where Bowie's career was heading at the time. He performed the track throughout the [[Isolar \u2013 1976 Tour|1976 Isolar Tour]], often in character as the Thin White Duke, and continued to perform it on different tours throughout his career. It was remastered, along with its parent album, as part of the box set ''[[Who Can I Be Now? (1974\u20131976)]]'' in 2016.\n\n==Composition==\n\"Station to Station\" was recorded at [[Cherokee Studios]] in Los Angeles between September and November 1975.{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=285}} During the song's recording, Bowie starved himself of all nutrients except [[milk]], red peppers, and [[cocaine]].<ref name=\"NME\">{{cite web |last1=Barker |first1=Emily |title=David Bowie's 40 greatest songs \u2013 as decided by ''NME'' and friends |url=https://www.nme.com/photos/david-bowie-s-40-greatest-songs-as-decided-by-nme-and-friends-1418012 |website=[[NME]] |accessdate=16 February 2020 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20191103063248/https://www.nme.com/photos/david-bowie-s-40-greatest-songs-as-decided-by-nme-and-friends-1418012 |archivedate=3 November 2019 |date=8 January 2018}}</ref> Bowie would later recall that he could not remember recording the album at all, other than a memory of standing with lead guitarist [[Earl Slick]] in the studio and asking him to play a [[Chuck Berry]]-style riff in the same key throughout the opening of \"Station to Station\".{{sfn|Buckley|2005|p=234}} At over 10 minutes in length, it is Bowie's longest studio recording.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=467}} Structurally, the song builds from a droning, guitar-driven introductory portion that mimics a train building up speed.{{sfn|Carr|Murray|1981|pp=78\u201380}} Following the train noise, the band begins to awaken, with percussion and keyboards playing chords in and out of key before the entire band erupts.{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=287}} What follows is a \"slow, hypnotic instrumental march\", led by an atonal guitar riff played by Bowie and Slick with syncopated accents across three bars in {{music|time|4|4}} and one in {{music|time|2|4}}.<ref name=\"Light RS\" />{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=287}} The march lasts for more than three minutes before Bowie begins his vocals.<ref name=\"Light RS\" /> After several verses, at the five-minute mark, a thud of drums signals a change of tempo and key and the band erupts into a prog-disco \"celebratory groove\" which lasts for the rest of the track.<ref name=\"Light RS\" /><ref name=\"Needham Guardian\">{{cite web |last1=Needham |first1=Alex |title=My favorite album: ''Station to Station'' by David Bowie |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2011/sep/16/station-station-david-bowie |website=[[The Guardian]] |accessdate=14 March 2020 |date=16 September 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190406095256/https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2011/sep/16/station-station-david-bowie |archive-date=6 April 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref>{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=288}} Doggett likens the section to a [[progressive rock]] suite by the 1970s bands [[Genesis (band)|Genesis]] and [[Jethro Tull (band)|Jethro Tull]].{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=287}} Like the album, the entire song dabbles in [[art rock]].<ref name=\"AllMusic album\">{{cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/station-to-station-mw0000098920|title=''Station to Station'' \u2013 David Bowie {{!}} Songs, Reviews, Credits|last=Erlewine|first=Stephen Thomas|website=[[AllMusic]]|access-date=1 August 2019|quote=At its heart, ''Station to Station'' is an avant-garde art-rock album, most explicitly on 'TVC 15' and the epic sprawl of the title track|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190424115507/https://www.allmusic.com/album/station-to-station-mw0000098920|archive-date=24 April 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nThe train sound effect was created by Slick using flangers and delay effects.{{sfn|Carr|Murray|1981|pp=78\u201380}}{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=287}} The noise pans from right to left across the stereo channels before \"disappearing into a tunnel\" using [[feedback]].{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=287}} According to biographer [[Nicholas Pegg]], the effect \"acknowledges\" the influence of the 1974 album ''[[Autobahn (album)|Autobahn]]'' by the German [[Electronic music|electronic]] band [[Kraftwerk]], which begins with a car starting up and driving across the stereo speakers.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=468}} Pegg believes another influence is from [[Edgar Froese]] of the German electronic band [[Tangerine Dream]], whom Bowie befriended during his \"Berlin\" years; Froese's 1975 album ''[[Epsilon in Malaysian Pale]]'' also begins with a train sound effect.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=468}} However, he notes that the train is a [[red herring]] in that it expresses what Bowie later called \"the album's 'wayward spiritual search'.\"{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=468}} More specifically, it reinstates the \"travelling metaphor\" of earlier compositions: \"the stations recall the 'new surroundings' of \"[[Rock 'n' Roll with Me]]\" [from ''[[Diamond Dogs]]''], and the \"mountains on mountains\" reprise the questing motifs of \"[[Wild Eyed Boy from Freecloud]]\" [from ''[[David Bowie (1969 album)|David Bowie]]'' (1969)] and ''[[The Man Who Sold the World]]''.\"{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=468}} Bowie would later state, \"the \"Station to Station\" track itself is very much concerned with the [[Stations of the Cross]],\"<ref name=Q97X /> the sequence of 14 landmarks on [[Jesus|Christ]]'s path to the [[Crucifixion of Jesus|crucifixion]], each a symbolic stopping-point for prayer.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=468}} Stuart Berman of ''[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]'' supports this, stating: \"the title track's momentous prog-disco suite [...] charts a course from spiritual void toward ecstatic religious reawakening.\"<ref name=\"Berman Pitchfork\">{{cite web|last=Berman|first=Stuart|url=http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14687-station-to-station-deluxe-edition/|title=David Bowie: ''Station to Station'' (Deluxe Edition)|work=[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]|date=29 September 2010|accessdate=22 October 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101021073153/http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14687-station-to-station-deluxe-edition/|archive-date=21 October 2010|url-status=live}}</ref> Another possible influence is guitarist [[Jimmy Page]] of the English rock band [[Led Zeppelin]]. Page was a session musician on Bowie's earliest recordings and had been an occasional acquaintance ever since.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=469}} During the same time Bowie became dependant on cocaine, Page had become dependant on [[heroin]] which, according to Pegg, was \"even more fearful\" than Bowie's addiction.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=469}} Led Zeppelin's ''[[Physical Graffiti]]'' was released in March 1975,<ref>{{cite AV media notes|title=Physical Graffiti|others=[[Led Zeppelin]]|year=1975|publisher=[[Swan Song Records]]|location=UK|type=liner notes|id=SSK 894007}}</ref> months ahead of the ''Station to Station'' sessions.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=469}} Pegg writes: \"It's possible to discern in [\"Station to Station\"] a distinct flavour of the groove, tempo and sense of building tension created by the famous rising riff of ''Physical Graffiti''<nowiki/>'s standout track '[[Kashmir (song)|Kashmir]]'\", an epic track that evokes a \"troubled spiritual journey\" through its music and lyrics.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=469}}\n\n==Lyrics==\n[[File:The Thin White Duke 76.jpg|thumb|160px|left|alt=David Bowie performing in 1976 and in character as the Thin White Duke|Bowie in character as the Thin White Duke performing on the [[Isolar \u2013 1976 Tour|1976 Isolar Tour]].]]\n\"Station to Station\" introduces Bowie's persona [[the Thin White Duke]], a sinister figure who became the mouthpiece for ''Station to Station'' and, often throughout 1976, for Bowie himself.<ref>{{cite web |last=Light |first=Alan |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-features/how-david-bowie-brought-thin-white-duke-to-life-on-station-to-station-125797/ |title=How David Bowie Brought Thin White Duke to Life on 'Station to Station' |work=[[Rolling Stone]] |accessdate=26 December 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181227040904/https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-features/how-david-bowie-brought-thin-white-duke-to-life-on-station-to-station-125797/ |archive-date=27 December 2018 |url-status=live }}</ref>{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=467}} The persona was noticeably darker than Bowie's previous characters, being described as \"a mad aristocrat\",{{sfn|Carr|Murray|1981|pp=78\u201380}} an \"amoral zombie\",{{sfn|Buckley|2000|p=258}} and \"an emotionless ''[[Aryan race|Aryan]]'' superman\".{{sfn|Pegg|2004|pp=297\u2013300}} For Bowie himself, the Duke was \"a nasty character indeed\".{{sfn|Wilcken|2005|p=24}} The lyrics themselves contain very cryptic messages.

Punctuated by the refrain \"It's too late\",{{sfn|Carr|Murray|1981|pp=78\u201380}} Bowie enters a landscape of \"mountains and sunbirds\".{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=288}} Themes of this section include drug use, as presented in the lyrics \"It's not the side effects of the cocaine/I'm thinking that it must be love\",{{sfn|Wilcken|2005|p=9}} which he sings in a joyous tone.{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=288}} Other themes present in the track are [[paranoia]] and odd fixations that were present in Bowie's mind at the time are also recurring themes.<ref name=\"Light RS\" /> Bowie at different points declares \"the European canon (or cannon) is here\", which Doggett believes is a \"pretentious way\" of summarising Bowie's interest in Kraftwerk and Brechtian theatre.{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=286}}\n\n==Release and reception==\n\"Station to Station\" was released as the opening title track to Bowie's tenth studio album [[Station to Station|of the same name]] on 23 January 1976.<ref name=\"AllMusic album\" /><ref>{{cite AV media notes|title=Station to Station|others=[[David Bowie]]|year=1976|publisher=[[RCA Records|RCA Victor]]|location=UK|type=liner notes|id=APL1 1327}}</ref> The song was also released as a [[promotional single]] (as 42549 A) in January 1976 in France by [[RCA Records]], with a shortened duration of 3:40 and \"[[TVC 15]]\" as the B-side.<ref name=\"single liner notes\" /> The single version begins at the central section of the song with the drums just prior to the \"once there were mountains...\" lyric.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=470}} The single edit appears on the 2010 Deluxe Edition of ''[[Station to Station]]'' and on ''Re:Call 2'', as part of the 2016 box set ''[[Who Can I Be Now?

This depression seems formed by nature for the design of giving a more secure lodgement to the egg of the Hedge-sparrow, or its young one, when the young Cuckoo is employed in removing either of them from the nest. When it is about twelve days old, this cavity is quite filled up, and then the back assumes the shape of nestling birds in general.\" <ref>(Letter to Hunter at the Royal Society, as above)</ref> Jenner's nephew assisted in the study. He was born on 30 June 1737.\n\nJenner's understanding of the cuckoo's behaviour was not entirely believed until the artist [[Jemima Blackburn]], a keen observer of bird life, saw a blind nestling pushing out a host's egg.
