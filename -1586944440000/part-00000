These unique drawings represent a diaristic aspect and frequently depict events from the past for example, ''Poor Love'' (1999), ''From The Week of Hell '94'' (1995) and ''Ripped Up'' (1995), which relate to a traumatic experience after an abortion or other personal events as seen in ''Fuck You Eddy'' (1995) and ''Sad Shower in New York'' (1995) which are both part of the Tate's collection of Emin's art.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artists/tracey-emin-2590|title=Tracey Emin |work=Tate Etc.}}</ref>\n\nOften they incorporate text as well as image, although some bear only text and others only image. The text appears as the artist's stream of consciousness voice. Some critics have compared Emin's text-only monoprints to ransom notes. The rapid, one-off technique involved in making monoprints is perfectly suited to (apparently) immediate expression, as is Emin's scratchy and informal drawing style. Emin frequently misspells words, deliberately or due to the speed at which she did each drawing. In a 2002 interview with [[Lynn Barber]], Emin said, \"It's not cute affectation. If I could spell, then I would spell correctly, but I never bothered to learn. So, rather than be inhibited and say I can't write because I can't spell, I just write and get on with it.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.parkettart.com/qwr/set_library.php3?directory=63|title=PARKETT Books|publisher=parkettart.com|accessdate=6 May 2016}}</ref>\n\nEmin created a key series of monoprints in 1997 with the text ''Something's Wrong''<ref>Terrebly Wrong (1997)</ref> or ''There Must Be Something Terebley Wrong With Me''<ref>''Something'' (1997)</ref> {{sic}} written with spelling mistakes intact in large capital letters alongside \"forlorn figures surrounded by space, their outlines fragile on the page.

These unique drawings represent a diaristic aspect and frequently depict events from the past for example, ''Poor Love'' (1999), ''From The Week of Hell '94'' (1995) and ''Ripped Up'' (1995), which relate to a traumatic experience after an abortion or other personal events as seen in ''Fuck You Eddy'' (1995) and ''Sad Shower in New York'' (1995) which are both part of the Tate's collection of Emin's art.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artists/tracey-emin-2590|title=Tracey Emin |work=Tate Etc.}}</ref>\n\nOften they incorporate text as well as image, although some bear only text and others only image. The text appears as the artist's stream of consciousness voice. Some critics have compared Emin's text-only monoprints to ransom notes. The rapid, one-off technique involved in making monoprints is perfectly suited to (apparently) immediate expression, as is Emin's scratchy and informal drawing style. Emin frequently misspells words, deliberately or due to the speed at which she did each drawing. In a 2002 interview with [[Lynn Barber]], Emin said, \"It's not cute affectation. If I could spell, then I would spell correctly, but I never bothered to learn. So, rather than be inhibited and say I can't write because I can't spell, I just write and get on with it.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.parkettart.com/qwr/set_library.php3?directory=63|title=PARKETT Books|publisher=parkettart.com|accessdate=6 May 2016}}</ref>\n\nEmin created a key series of monoprints in 1997 with the text ''Something's Wrong''<ref>Terrebly Wrong (1997)</ref> or ''There Must Be Something Terebley Wrong With Me''<ref>''Something'' (1997)</ref> {{sic}} written with spelling mistakes intact in large capital letters alongside \"forlorn figures surrounded by space, their outlines fragile on the page.

In The Livingroom'' (1994). Emin further produced a set of monoprints detailing her memories of [[Margate]]'s iconic buildings such as ''Margate Harbour 16/5/95'' (1995), ''The Lido 16/5/95'' (1995) and ''Light House 15/5/95'' (1995).

According to the {{PH wikidata|population_as_of}}, it has a population of {{PH wikidata|population_total}} people.{{PH census|current}}\n\n==Etymology==\nThe word \"Toboso\" was mentioned by Spanish Explorer to be a group of early American Indians living in Texas and Monterey, Mexico. Probably, Spanish Colonizer in the Philippines named this Town. Philippine history books also mentioned Spanish Colonizers naming Filipinos as \"Indio\" (East Indies, Indies, or Indians).\n\n==Economy==\nEconomic progress in Toboso is slow due to the limited number of business establishments. It is commonly called \"the municipality with the highest poverty incidence\" in Negros Occidental. Since its municipality recognition on July 1, 1948, the town struggled to be at par with its neighboring cities like [[Escalante, Negros Occidental|Escalante]], [[Sagay, Negros Occidental|Sagay]], [[San Carlos, Negros Occidental|San Carlos]] and the [[Calatrava, Negros Occidental|town of Calatrava]].<ref>Philippine Philippine Statistics Authority</ref>\n\nEconomy depends on sugarcane plantation, farming (livestocks and poultry/game fowl) and fishing. Inhabitants often find work in neighboring provinces (engage in shipbuilding). Others worked as [[Overseas Filipino Workers]], others engage in handicraft business. Some choose food preparations and forming of local, small businesses.\n\n==People==\nThe town is generally peaceful with friendly inhabitants. A townhouse is situated in barangay Poblacion and is accessible by land and smaller boats for sea travel.\n\nThe inhabitants speak two languages: [[Cebuano language|Cebuano]] followed by [[Hiligaynon language|Ilonggo]] and of course, Filipino and English which were taught in schools.\n\nThe prominent families who have ruled this town are the Bedonia, De la Cruz, Baynosa and Valencia. The current mayor is Richard M.

According to the {{PH wikidata|population_as_of}}, it has a population of {{PH wikidata|population_total}} people.{{PH census|current}}\n\n==Etymology==\nThe word \"Toboso\" was mentioned by Spanish Explorer to be a group of early American Indians living in Texas and Monterey, Mexico. Probably, Spanish Colonizer in the Philippines named this Town. Philippine history books also mentioned Spanish Colonizers naming Filipinos as \"Indio\" (East Indies, Indies, or Indians).\n\n==Economy==\nEconomic progress in Toboso is slow due to the limited number of business establishments. It is commonly called \"the municipality with the highest poverty incidence\" in Negros Occidental. Since its municipality recognition on July 1, 1948, the town struggled to be at par with its neighboring cities like [[Escalante, Negros Occidental|Escalante]], [[Sagay, Negros Occidental|Sagay]], [[San Carlos, Negros Occidental|San Carlos]] and the [[Calatrava, Negros Occidental|town of Calatrava]].<ref>Philippine Philippine Statistics Authority</ref>\n\nEconomy depends on sugarcane plantation, farming (livestocks and poultry/game fowl) and fishing. Inhabitants often find work in neighboring provinces (engage in shipbuilding). Others worked as [[Overseas Filipino Workers]], others engage in handicraft business. Some choose food preparations and forming of local, small businesses.\n\n==People==\nThe town is generally peaceful with friendly inhabitants. A townhouse is situated in barangay Poblacion and is accessible by land and smaller boats for sea travel.\n\nThe inhabitants speak two languages: [[Cebuano language|Cebuano]] followed by [[Hiligaynon language|Ilonggo]] and of course, Filipino and English which were taught in schools.\n\nThe prominent families who have ruled this town are the Bedonia, De la Cruz, Baynosa and Valencia. The current mayor is Richard M. Jaojoco.\n\n==Barangays==\nToboso is politically subdivided into 9 [[barangay]]s.\n\n* Bandila\n* Bug-ang\n* General Luna\n* Magticol\n* Poblacion\n* Salamanca\n* San Isidro\n* San Jose\n* Tabun-ac\n\n==Demographics==\n{{Philippine Census \n| align= none\n| title= Population census of Toboso\n| 1903 = \n| 1918 = \n| 1939 = \n| 1948 = 29278\n| 1960 = 36378\n| 1970 = 28358\n| 1975 = 35737\n| 1980 = 36415\n| 1990 = 34621\n| 1995 = 38623\n| 2000 = 40712\n| 2007 = 41358\n| 2010 = 41658\n| 2015 = 42114\n| 2020 =\n| 2025 =\n| 2030 =\n| footnote= Source: [[Philippine Statistics Authority]]{{PH census|2015}}{{PH census|2010}}{{PH census|2007}}{{LWUA population data}} \n}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.nscb.gov.ph/activestats/psgc/default.asp Philippine Standard Geographic Code]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20131004104825/http://census.gov.ph/ Philippine Census Information]\n* [http://www.blgs.gov.ph/lgpmsv2/cmshome/index.php?pageID=23&frmIdDcfCode=7&fLguType=CM&frmIdRegion=9&frmIdProvince=55&frmIdLgu=1000 Local Governance Performance Management System]\n\n{{Geographic location\n| Centre = Toboso\n| North  = [[Escalante, Negros Occidental|Escalante]]\n| East   = ''[[Ta\u00f1on Strait]]''\n| South  = [[Calatrava, Negros Occidental|Calatrava]]\n| West   = [[Sagay, Negros Occidental|Sagay]]\n}}\n{{Negros Occidental}}\n\n[[Category:Municipalities of Negros Occidental]]\n\n\n{{NegrosIR-geo-stub}}\n", "name_user": "RepublicaNegrense", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toboso,_Negros_Occidental"}
