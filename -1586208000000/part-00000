There is no specific date for when the office of prime minister first appeared, as the role was not created but rather evolved over a period of time through a merger of duties.{{sfn|Hennessy|2001|pp=39\u201340}} However, the term was regularly if informally used of Walpole by the 1730s.<ref>Stephen Taylor ODNB</ref> It was used in the [[House of Commons of Great Britain|House of Commons]] as early as 1805,{{sfn|Castlereagh|1805}} and it was certainly in parliamentary use by the 1880s.{{sfnm|1a1=Eardley-Wilmot|1y=1885|2a1=Macfarlane|2y=1885}} In 1905 the post of prime minister was officially given recognition in the [[Orders of precedence in the United Kingdom|order of precedence]].{{sfn|Marriott|1923|page=83}} Modern historians generally consider [[Sir Robert Walpole]], who led the government of [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Great Britain]] for over twenty years from 1721,{{sfnm|1a1=Clarke|1y=1999|1p=266|2a1=Hennessy|2y=2001|2pp=39\u201340}} as the first prime minister. Walpole is also the longest-serving British prime minister by this definition.{{sfn|BBC News|1998}} However, [[Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman]] was the first and [[Margaret Thatcher]] the longest-serving prime minister officially referred to as such in the order of precedence.{{sfnm|1a1=Mackay|1y=1987|2a1=Marriott|2y=1923|2p=83}} The first to use the title in an official act was [[Benjamin Disraeli]], who signed the [[Treaty of Berlin (1878)|Treaty of Berlin]] as \"Prime Minister of her Britannic Majesty\" in 1878.{{sfn|Bogdanor|1997}}\n\nStrictly, the first prime minister of the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom (of Great Britain and Ireland)]] was [[William Pitt the Younger]].{{sfnm|1a1=Burt|1y=1874|1p=106|2a1=Castlereagh|2y=1805}} The first prime minister of the current United Kingdom, i.e. the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, was [[Bonar Law]],{{sfn|Law|1922}} although the country was not renamed officially until 1927, when [[Stanley Baldwin]] was the serving prime minister.{{sfn|Royal and Parliamentary Titles Act|1927}}\n\nDue to the gradual evolution of the post of prime minister, the title is applied to early prime ministers only retrospectively;{{sfn|Leonard|2010|page=1}} this has sometimes given rise to academic dispute. [[William Pulteney, 1st Earl of Bath|Lord Bath]] and [[James Waldegrave, 2nd Earl Waldegrave|Lord Waldegrave]] are sometimes listed as prime ministers.{{sfn|Carpenter|1992|page=37}} Bath was invited to [[Short-lived ministry|form a ministry]] by [[George II of Great Britain|{{nowrap|George II}}]] when [[Henry Pelham]] resigned in 1746,{{sfn|Leonard|2010|page=47}} as was Waldegrave in 1757 after the dismissal of [[William Pitt the Elder]],{{sfn|Leonard|2010|page=65}} who dominated the affairs of government [[Great Britain in the Seven Years' War|during the Seven Years' War]]. Neither was able to command sufficient parliamentary support to form a government; Bath stepped down after two days,{{sfn|Carpenter|1992|page=37}} and Waldegrave after three.{{sfn|Leonard|2010|page=65}} Modern academic consensus does not consider either man to have held office as prime minister,{{sfn|''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography''|2011}} and they are therefore listed separately.\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Before 1721== \nPrior to the [[Georgian era]], the [[HM Treasury|Treasury]] of [[Kingdom of England|England]] was led by the [[Lord High Treasurer]].{{sfn|Chisholm|1911f}} By the late [[Tudor period]], the Lord High Treasurer was regarded as one of the [[Great Officers of State]],{{sfn|Chisholm|1911f}} and was often (though not always) the dominant figure in government: [[Edward Seymour, 1st Duke of Somerset]] (Lord High Treasurer, 1547\u20131549),{{sfn|Pollard|1904}} served as [[Lord Protector]] to his prepubescent nephew [[Edward VI of England|{{nowrap|Edward VI}}]];{{sfn|Pollard|1904}} [[William Cecil, 1st Baron Burghley]] (Lord High Treasurer, 1572\u20131598),{{sfn|Chisholm|1911a}} was the dominant [[List of ministers to Queen Elizabeth I|minister to {{nowrap|Elizabeth I}}]];{{sfn|Chisholm|1911a}} Burghley's son [[Robert Cecil, 1st Earl of Salisbury]], succeeded his father as chief minister to {{nowrap|Elizabeth I}} (1598\u20131603) and was eventually appointed by [[James VI and I|{{nowrap|James I}}]] as Lord High Treasurer (1608\u20131612).{{sfn|Chisholm|1911c}}\n\nBy the late [[Stuart period]], the Treasury was often run not by a single individual, i.e. Lord High Treasurer, but by a [[wikt:commission#Noun|commission]] of [[Lords of the Treasury]],{{sfn|Chapman|2002}} led by the [[First Lord of the Treasury]]. The last Lords High Treasurer, [[Lord Godolphin]] (1702\u20131710) and [[Robert Harley, 1st Earl of Oxford and Earl Mortimer|Lord Oxford]] (1711\u20131714),{{sfnm|1a1=Fisher Russell Barker|1y=1890|2a1=Stephen|2y=1890}} ran the government of [[Anne, Queen of Great Britain|Queen Anne]].{{sfn|Morrill|2018}}\n\nAfter the succession of [[George I of Great Britain|{{nowrap|George I}}]] in 1714, the arrangement of a commission of Lords of the Treasury (as opposed to a single Lord High Treasurer) became permanent.{{sfn|Chapman|2002|page=15}} For the next three years, the government was headed by [[Charles Townshend, 2nd Viscount Townshend|Lord Townshend]], who was appointed [[Secretary of State for the Northern Department]].{{sfn|McMullen Rigg|1899}} Subsequently, [[James Stanhope, 1st Earl Stanhope|Lord Stanhope]] and [[Charles Spencer, 3rd Earl of Sunderland|Lord Sunderland]] ran the government jointly,{{sfnm|1a1=Chisholm|1y=1911d|2a1=Chisholm|2y=1911e}} with Stanhope managing foreign affairs and Sunderland domestic.{{sfnm|1a1=Chisholm|1y=1911d|2a1=Chisholm|2y=1911e}} Stanhope died in February 1721 and Sunderland resigned two months later;{{sfnm|1a1=Chisholm|1y=1911d|2a1=Chisholm|2y=1911e}} Townshend and [[Robert Walpole]] were then invited to form the next government.{{sfnm|1a1=Chisholm|1y=1911b|2a1=McMullen Rigg|2y=1899}} From that point, the holder of the {{em|office}} of First Lord also usually (albeit unofficially) held the status of prime minister.

There is no specific date for when the office of prime minister first appeared, as the role was not created but rather evolved over a period of time through a merger of duties.{{sfn|Hennessy|2001|pp=39\u201340}} However, the term was regularly if informally used of Walpole by the 1730s.<ref>Stephen Taylor ODNB</ref> It was used in the [[House of Commons of Great Britain|House of Commons]] as early as 1805,{{sfn|Castlereagh|1805}} and it was certainly in parliamentary use by the 1880s.{{sfnm|1a1=Eardley-Wilmot|1y=1885|2a1=Macfarlane|2y=1885}} In 1905 the post of prime minister was officially given recognition in the [[Orders of precedence in the United Kingdom|order of precedence]].{{sfn|Marriott|1923|page=83}} Modern historians generally consider [[Sir Robert Walpole]], who led the government of [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Great Britain]] for over twenty years from 1721,{{sfnm|1a1=Clarke|1y=1999|1p=266|2a1=Hennessy|2y=2001|2pp=39\u201340}} as the first prime minister. Walpole is also the longest-serving British prime minister by this definition.{{sfn|BBC News|1998}} However, [[Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman]] was the first and [[Margaret Thatcher]] the longest-serving prime minister officially referred to as such in the order of precedence.{{sfnm|1a1=Mackay|1y=1987|2a1=Marriott|2y=1923|2p=83}} The first to use the title in an official act was [[Benjamin Disraeli]], who signed the [[Treaty of Berlin (1878)|Treaty of Berlin]] as \"Prime Minister of her Britannic Majesty\" in 1878.{{sfn|Bogdanor|1997}}\n\nStrictly, the first prime minister of the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom (of Great Britain and Ireland)]] was [[William Pitt the Younger]].{{sfnm|1a1=Burt|1y=1874|1p=106|2a1=Castlereagh|2y=1805}} The first prime minister of the current United Kingdom, i.e. the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, was [[Bonar Law]],{{sfn|Law|1922}} although the country was not renamed officially until 1927, when [[Stanley Baldwin]] was the serving prime minister.{{sfn|Royal and Parliamentary Titles Act|1927}}\n\nDue to the gradual evolution of the post of prime minister, the title is applied to early prime ministers only retrospectively;{{sfn|Leonard|2010|page=1}} this has sometimes given rise to academic dispute. [[William Pulteney, 1st Earl of Bath|Lord Bath]] and [[James Waldegrave, 2nd Earl Waldegrave|Lord Waldegrave]] are sometimes listed as prime ministers.{{sfn|Carpenter|1992|page=37}} Bath was invited to [[Short-lived ministry|form a ministry]] by [[George II of Great Britain|{{nowrap|George II}}]] when [[Henry Pelham]] resigned in 1746,{{sfn|Leonard|2010|page=47}} as was Waldegrave in 1757 after the dismissal of [[William Pitt the Elder]],{{sfn|Leonard|2010|page=65}} who dominated the affairs of government [[Great Britain in the Seven Years' War|during the Seven Years' War]]. Neither was able to command sufficient parliamentary support to form a government; Bath stepped down after two days,{{sfn|Carpenter|1992|page=37}} and Waldegrave after three.{{sfn|Leonard|2010|page=65}} Modern academic consensus does not consider either man to have held office as prime minister,{{sfn|''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography''|2011}} and they are therefore listed separately.\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Before 1721== \nPrior to the [[Georgian era]], the [[HM Treasury|Treasury]] of [[Kingdom of England|England]] was led by the [[Lord High Treasurer]].{{sfn|Chisholm|1911f}} By the late [[Tudor period]], the Lord High Treasurer was regarded as one of the [[Great Officers of State]],{{sfn|Chisholm|1911f}} and was often (though not always) the dominant figure in government: [[Edward Seymour, 1st Duke of Somerset]] (Lord High Treasurer, 1547\u20131549),{{sfn|Pollard|1904}} served as [[Lord Protector]] to his prepubescent nephew [[Edward VI of England|{{nowrap|Edward VI}}]];{{sfn|Pollard|1904}} [[William Cecil, 1st Baron Burghley]] (Lord High Treasurer, 1572\u20131598),{{sfn|Chisholm|1911a}} was the dominant [[List of ministers to Queen Elizabeth I|minister to {{nowrap|Elizabeth I}}]];{{sfn|Chisholm|1911a}} Burghley's son [[Robert Cecil, 1st Earl of Salisbury]], succeeded his father as chief minister to {{nowrap|Elizabeth I}} (1598\u20131603) and was eventually appointed by [[James VI and I|{{nowrap|James I}}]] as Lord High Treasurer (1608\u20131612).{{sfn|Chisholm|1911c}}\n\nBy the late [[Stuart period]], the Treasury was often run not by a single individual, i.e. Lord High Treasurer, but by a [[wikt:commission#Noun|commission]] of [[Lords of the Treasury]],{{sfn|Chapman|2002}} led by the [[First Lord of the Treasury]]. The last Lords High Treasurer, [[Lord Godolphin]] (1702\u20131710) and [[Robert Harley, 1st Earl of Oxford and Earl Mortimer|Lord Oxford]] (1711\u20131714),{{sfnm|1a1=Fisher Russell Barker|1y=1890|2a1=Stephen|2y=1890}} ran the government of [[Anne, Queen of Great Britain|Queen Anne]].{{sfn|Morrill|2018}}\n\nAfter the succession of [[George I of Great Britain|{{nowrap|George I}}]] in 1714, the arrangement of a commission of Lords of the Treasury (as opposed to a single Lord High Treasurer) became permanent.{{sfn|Chapman|2002|page=15}} For the next three years, the government was headed by [[Charles Townshend, 2nd Viscount Townshend|Lord Townshend]], who was appointed [[Secretary of State for the Northern Department]].{{sfn|McMullen Rigg|1899}} Subsequently, [[James Stanhope, 1st Earl Stanhope|Lord Stanhope]] and [[Charles Spencer, 3rd Earl of Sunderland|Lord Sunderland]] ran the government jointly,{{sfnm|1a1=Chisholm|1y=1911d|2a1=Chisholm|2y=1911e}} with Stanhope managing foreign affairs and Sunderland domestic.{{sfnm|1a1=Chisholm|1y=1911d|2a1=Chisholm|2y=1911e}} Stanhope died in February 1721 and Sunderland resigned two months later;{{sfnm|1a1=Chisholm|1y=1911d|2a1=Chisholm|2y=1911e}} Townshend and [[Robert Walpole]] were then invited to form the next government.{{sfnm|1a1=Chisholm|1y=1911b|2a1=McMullen Rigg|2y=1899}} From that point, the holder of the {{em|office}} of First Lord also usually (albeit unofficially) held the status of prime minister.

At the time, these stations were not illegal because they were broadcasting from international waters. The stations were set up by entrepreneurs and music enthusiasts to meet the growing demand for [[pop music|pop]] and [[rock music]], which was not catered for by [[BBC Radio]] services.<ref name=\"chapman\">{{cite book|author=Chapman, Robert|title=Selling the Sixties: The Pirates and Pop Music Radio|publisher=Routledge|year=1992|isbn=0415078172}}</ref>\n\nThe first British pirate radio station was [[Radio Caroline]], which started broadcasting from a ship off the [[Essex]] coast in 1964.

Many followed a [[top-40]] format with casual DJs, making UK pirate radio the antithesis of BBC radio at the time.<ref name=\"fleming\"></ref> Spurred on by the offshore stations, land-based pirate stations took to the air on medium wave at weekends, such as Radio Free London in 1968.<ref name=\"flashes\">{{cite web|url=http://www.flashesandflames.com/2014/03/how-a-radio-ship-and-7-men-shook-up-britain-50-years-ago/|title=How a radio ship and 7 men shook up Britain in 1964|author=Colin Morrison|date=18 March 2014|work=Flashes & Flames}}</ref>\n\nRadio Caroline's audience was one third the size of the [[BBC]]s [[Light Programme]] in the parts of the country where it could be received, but the Light Programme's audience did not decrease, indicating that pirate radio appealed to an audience that the BBC did not serve.<ref name=\"Crisell\">{{cite book|author=Crisell, Andrew|title=An Introductory History of British Broadcasting|publisher=Routledge|year=1997|isbn=0-415-12802-1}}</ref>\n\nIn reaction to the popularity of pirate radio, [[BBC radio]] was restructured in 1967, establishing [[BBC Radio 1]], [[BBC Radio 2|Radio 2]], [[BBC Radio 3|Radio 3]] and [[BBC Radio 4|Radio 4]]. A number of DJs of the newly formed Radio 1 came from pirate stations. The UK Government also closed the international waters loophole via the [[Marine Broadcasting Offences Act]] of 1967, although Radio Caroline would continue to broadcast in various forms right up to 1990.<ref name=\"fleming\"></ref>\n\n== 1970s ==\nThe Marine Broadcasting Offences Act officially outlawed offshore stations, but unlicensed radio continued, moving from ships and sea-based platforms to [[urban areas]] in the latter part of the 1960s despite being already illegal under the [[Wireless Telegraphy Act 1949]]).<ref name=\"fleming\"></ref> During this period, home-made medium wave (and sometimes [[short wave]]) transmitters were often constructed inside cheap, expendable biscuit tins.<ref name=\"indepie\">{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.ie/entertainment/radio/pirates-of-the-airwaves-recall-days-of-radio-and-raids-and-transmitters-hidden-in-jacobs-biscuit-tins-37379412.html|title=Pirates of the airwaves recall days of radio and raids - and transmitters hidden in Jacob's biscuit tins|author=Breda Hefernan|date=3 October 2018|work=[[Irish Independent]]}}</ref> The main method employed by most medium-wave or short-wave pirate stations during the 1970s involved programming played back on cassette recorders (often powered by a car battery), with a long wire antenna slung up between two trees. \n\nThe 1970s and 1980s saw a wave of land-based pirate radio, broadcasting mostly in larger towns and cities, transmitting from flats and [[tower blocks]].  These included community-focused local stations as well as stations emerging for the first time to specialise in particular [[music genres]]. One of the earliest was [[Radio Jackie]] originally broadcasting in south west London.<ref name=\"hindmosco\">{{cite book|author=Hind, John & Mosco, Stephen|title=Rebel Radio: The Full Story of British Pirate Radio|year=1985|publisher=Pluto Press|isbn=978-0-7453-0055-9}}</ref>\n\n[[Soul music]] stations would start to appear in the 1970s. The first of these was [[Radio Invicta (London pirate station)|Radio Invicta]], regarded as Europe's first soul music station first broadcasting in 1970. The station would launch the careers of [[Pete Tong]], [[Gilles Peterson]] and a number of the shows were presented by what was then known as the \"Soul Mafia\" - DJs such as [[Chris Hill (DJ)|Chris Hill]] and [[DJ Froggy|Froggy]].<ref name=\"hindmosco\"></ref><ref name=\"hebditch\"></ref>\n\n== 1980s ==\nEntering the 1980s, transmitters capable of [[FM broadcasting]] were beginning to be picked up reasonably cheaply, with the ability to transmit over a forty-mile radius from a 15-storey tower. Engineers such as Pyers Easton would build them for stations such as [[London Greek Radio]] and [[Kiss 100 London|Kiss FM]].<ref name=\"hebditch\">{{cite book|author=Hebditch, Stephen|title=London's Pirate Pioneers|publisher=TX Publications|date=2015|isbn=9780993265204}}</ref> \n\nIn London, a notable moment would be the launching of Britain's first black owned music station [[Dread Broadcasting Corporation]] (DBC) in 1980. DBC played [[reggae]] and [[soca music|soca]] as well as other [[black music]] and would be instrumental to the later development of [[black community]] broadcasting as well as launching the career of [[BBC]] presenter [[Ranking Miss P]].<ref name=\"hindmosco\"></ref><ref name=\"hebditch\"></ref>\n\nSoul stations would become prolific in the early-mid 1980s, with Invicta joined by Horizon Radio, and JFM in 1981. Both of these would broadcast until 1985 when they were followed by Solar Radio and Starpoint.<ref name=\"hebditch\"></ref> [[London Weekend Radio]] (LWR) would start life in 1983 playing contemporary [[pop music]] during the day with more specialist shows in the evenings and weekends; however, having briefly closed down, management of the station was handed to club promoter Zak Dee and in 1984, LWR rose again as a dedicated [[soul music|soul]], [[hip hop]], [[jazz-funk]], and [[reggae]] station, launching the career of [[Tim Westwood]].<ref name=\"hebditch\"></ref><ref name=\"amfmlwr\">{{cite web|url=https://www.amfm.org.uk/pirates/lwr-london-weekend-radio.html|title=LWR - London pirate radio history - AM/FM|work=Amfm.org.uk|author=Stephen Hebditch|date=1 May 2015}}</ref> LWR's biggest rival would arrive in the form of [[Kiss 100 London#Pirate_roots|Kiss FM]], first broadcasting in late 1985. The station was formed by George Power who had previously run another pirate station, [[London Greek Radio]], along with DJs Gordon Mac and Tosca Jackson. By 1988, Kiss would boast a line-up of top DJs including [[Norman Jay]], [[Jazzie B]] (of [[Soul II Soul]]), [[Colin Faver]], [[Trevor Nelson]], [[Judge Jules]], [[Danny Rampling]], [[Paul Trouble Anderson]], and [[Coldcut]], playing [[soul music|soul]], [[jazz-funk]], [[reggae]], [[hip hop]] and the emerging sounds of [[house (music)|house music]].<ref name=\"amfmkiss\">{{cite web|url=https://www.amfm.org.uk/pirates/kiss-fm.html|title=Kiss FM - London pirate radio history - AM/FM|work=Amfm.org.uk|author=Stephen Hebditch|date=17 February 2015}}</ref> A 1987 [[Evening Standard]] readers' poll placed Kiss in second place behind [[Capital Radio]] and ahead of [[BBC Radio 1|Radio 1]].\n\nAround the UK, the West Midlands and Birmingham would see a large number of stations forming including the likes of [[PCRL|Peoples Community Radio Link]] (PCRL) which started in 1985, and [[Sunshine 855|Sunshine Radio]].<ref name=\"hindmosco\"></ref>\n\nDespite being better catered for by legal radio, there was still space for stations playing [[alternative rock]] and [[indie music]] which was struggling to get mainstream [[airplay]]. In London, stations such as RFM (Rock FM) and London Rock, and in [[Manchester]] [[KFM Radio]] would spring up to cater for those music genres during the mid-late 1980s.<ref name=\"hebditch\"></ref> In 1989, a London pirate radio station [[Q102 (Pirate Station)|Q102]] would become a short-lived but hugely influential station in the breaking of early 1990s [[indie music|indie]] and [[Britpop]] [[band (rock and pop)|bands]]. This station would be the roots of the later legal [[XFM]].<ref name=\"xmarks\">{{cite web|url=https://www.transdiffusion.org/2004/01/01/xfm_2|title=X marks the spot|author=Darryl Chamberlain|work=Transdiffusion.org|date=1 January 2004}}</ref>\n\nPirate radio met with increasing opposition, especially from the authorities in the form of the [[Department of Trade and Industry (United Kingdom)|Department of Trade and Industry]] (DTI). It had claimed since the 1970s that pirate radio caused interference to licensed broadcasters and could interfere with frequencies used by emergency services. Nonetheless the growth of pirate radio in the 1980s was so rapid that at one point pirate radio operators outnumbered legal broadcasters and in popularity.<ref name=\"hebditch\"></ref>\n\nTwice in the mid-late 1980s, the [[Government of the United Kingdom|UK Government]] had floated plans to tackle pirate radio by offering new licenses, particularly in [[London]].<ref name=\"amfm1988\">{{cite web|url=https://www.amfm.org.uk/tx/tx18/news.html|title=AM/FM - News Radio Today September 1988|author=Stephen Hebditch|date=2 November 2002|work=Amfm.org.uk}}</ref> In 1989, new licenses were advertised but stations would have to commit to closing down voluntarily and come off-air as part of bidding for them. London's [[Kiss 100 London#Pirate_roots|Kiss FM]] was one of those that duly did so, yet despite strong backing and support, would lose out to [[102.2 Jazz FM|Jazz FM]]. However, further licenses were advertised subsequently and Kiss would win one on its second attempt and become the UK's first legal radio station specialising in black and dance music in September 1990.\n\nHowever, even as this unfolded, a new wave of pirate radio stations emerged as the [[acid house]] scene exploded. Particularly in London, stations such as Sunrise, Fantasy and [[Centreforce]] became the \"seven day rave stations\".<ref name=\"hebditch\"></ref>\n\n==1990s==\nThe [[Broadcasting Act 1990]] led to the brief decline of UK pirate radio by encouraging diversity in radio and opening up the development of commercial radio, whilst bringing in tougher penalties for those caught in unlicensed broadcasting. However, the number of unlicensed broadcasters would soon begin to rise again, partly out of the belief that the Act had undermined [[community radio]] and small scale broadcasters.<ref name=\"fleming\"></ref> As stations such as Kiss would increasingly discover that advertising revenue and market share became as important as the music it played, new pirate stations once again sprung up to cater for underground music scenes that were developing. The biggest of these would be the rising [[rave]] music scene, with stations moving to a \"rave on the air\" format with back to back mixing and listener participation through 'shouts' - enabled by the growth of [[pager|pagers]] and [[mobile phone|mobile phones]]. In London, such stations included the likes of Rush, [[Kool FM]], Pulse FM, Innocence, [[Don FM]], and Defection.<ref name=\"dazed\">{{cite web|url=https://www.dazeddigital.com/music/article/34394/1/pirate-radio-history-and-future|title=The history of UK pirate radio \u2013 and why it\u2019s still here|author=Alice Nicolov|date=19 January 2017|work=[[Dazed]]}}</ref>\n\nThe authorities and media increasingly alleged an [[organised crime]] and [[drugs]] link with the rave stations, culminating in a high-profile raid in [[Hackney, London|Hackney]] in the summer of 1993 on Rush.<ref name=\"hebdrugs\">{{cite web|url=https://www.amfm.org.uk/amfmnews/amfm14.html|title=AM/FM News #14 - August 1993|work=Amfm.org.uk|author=Stephen Hebditch|date=14 February 2002}}</ref> The ''[[Evening Standard]]'' headline exclaimed \"Drug gangs set up fortresses.\"<ref name=\"hackneyhistory\">{{cite web|url=https://hackneyhistory.wordpress.com/2013/01/21/rush-fm-raided-1993/ |title=Rush FM raided, 1993 - The Radical History of Hackney|website=Hackney History|date=21 January 2013}}</ref> Toughened laws also sought to incur heavier fines on [[DJ]]s and businesses that advertised on stations.<ref name=\"indiepirates\">{{cite news|author=Philip Fergusson |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/media/media-pirates-remain-afloat-illegal-radio-stations-are-continuing-to-defy-tough-new-laws-says-philip-fergusson-1548817.html |title=Media: Pirates remain afloat: Illegal radio stations are continuing to defy tough new laws, says Philip Fergusson \u2013 Media|work=[[The Independent]]|date=2 September 1992}}</ref>\n\nFor those ill-served by mainstream and legal radio, pirate radio filled the void especially for the [[black community]].

The development and promotion of grass-roots talent, the [[urban music]] scene and minority community groups were identified as key drivers for pirate radio.

Pirate radio was regarded as the best place to hear new music and particularly urban music.

However, the number of unlicensed broadcasters would soon begin to rise again, partly out of the belief that the Act had undermined [[community radio]] and small scale broadcasters.<ref name=\"fleming\"></ref> As stations such as Kiss would increasingly discover that advertising revenue and market share became as important as the music it played, new pirate stations once again sprung up to cater for underground music scenes that were developing.

Hejduk is noted for having had a profound interest in the fundamental issues of shape, organization, representation, and reciprocity.\n\nHejduk studied at the [[Cooper Union School of Art and Architecture]], the [[University of Cincinnati]], and the [[Harvard Graduate School of Design]]. He worked in several offices in New York including that of [[I. M. Pei]] and Partners and the office of A.M. Kinney and Associates. He established his own practice in New York City in 1965.<ref name=\"GreatBuildings\">{{cite web  |url=http://www.greatbuildings.com/architects/John_Hejduk.html/\n|publisher=Great Buildings Collection |title=John Hejduk |accessdate=18 January 2009}}</ref>\n\n== Career ==\n\n===As a professor===\nHejduk was Professor of Architecture at [[Cooper Union|The Cooper Union for the Advancement of Science and Art, School of Architecture]] from 1964 to 2000 and Dean of the School of Architecture from 1975 to 2000. His arrival including the cooperation of many other influential professors (including [[Raimund Abraham]], [[Ricardo Scofidio]], [[Peter Eisenman]], [[Charles Gwathmey]], [[Diana Agrest]], Diane Lewis, [[Elizabeth Diller]], [[David Shapiro (poet)|David Shapiro]], Don Wall and many others) transformed the practice and critical thought of architecture in ways that might be compared to [[Ludwig Mies Van Der Rohe]]'s transformation of the Armour Institute into the [[Illinois Institute of Technology]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2013}}\n\n==Approach==\nHis early work and curriculum grew from a set of exercises exploring cubes, grids, and frames, through an examination of square grids placed within diagonal containers set against an occasional curving wall, towards a series of experiments with flat planes and curved masses in various combinations and colors.<ref name=\"GreatBuildings\"/> To aid his research he was awarded a grant from the Graham Foundation in 1967. Eventually, John Hejduk's \"hard-line\" modernist space-making exercises, heavily influenced by [[Frank Lloyd Wright]] and [[Ludwig Mies Van Der Rohe]], moved away from his interests in favor of free-hand \"figure/objects\" influenced by mythology and spirituality, clearly expressing the nature of his poetry.{{Citation needed|date=October 2013}}  The relationship between Hejduk's shape/objects and their surroundings is a controversial subject, raising questions similar to those raised by the early houses of [[Peter Eisenman]].\n\nThe architectural historian K. Michael Hays has described Hejduk's architecture as one of \"Encounter\", describing Hejduk's objects as seeming \"impossibly, to be aware of us, to address us.

Hejduk is noted for having had a profound interest in the fundamental issues of shape, organization, representation, and reciprocity.\n\nHejduk studied at the [[Cooper Union School of Art and Architecture]], the [[University of Cincinnati]], and the [[Harvard Graduate School of Design]]. He worked in several offices in New York including that of [[I. M. Pei]] and Partners and the office of A.M. Kinney and Associates.

His arrival including the cooperation of many other influential professors (including [[Raimund Abraham]], [[Ricardo Scofidio]], [[Peter Eisenman]], [[Charles Gwathmey]], [[Diana Agrest]], Diane Lewis, [[Elizabeth Diller]], [[David Shapiro (poet)|David Shapiro]], Don Wall and many others) transformed the practice and critical thought of architecture in ways that might be compared to [[Ludwig Mies Van Der Rohe]]'s transformation of the Armour Institute into the [[Illinois Institute of Technology]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2013}}\n\n==Approach==\nHis early work and curriculum grew from a set of exercises exploring cubes, grids, and frames, through an examination of square grids placed within diagonal containers set against an occasional curving wall, towards a series of experiments with flat planes and curved masses in various combinations and colors.<ref name=\"GreatBuildings\"/> To aid his research he was awarded a grant from the Graham Foundation in 1967. Eventually, John Hejduk's \"hard-line\" modernist space-making exercises, heavily influenced by [[Frank Lloyd Wright]] and [[Ludwig Mies Van Der Rohe]], moved away from his interests in favor of free-hand \"figure/objects\" influenced by mythology and spirituality, clearly expressing the nature of his poetry.{{Citation needed|date=October 2013}}  The relationship between Hejduk's shape/objects and their surroundings is a controversial subject, raising questions similar to those raised by the early houses of [[Peter Eisenman]].\n\nThe architectural historian K.

He was elected to the [[Royal Academy]] in 1892 as A.R.A. and was an active, if intermittent, member of the [[Art Workers Guild]]. He was a central figure in the British movement known as [[New Sculpture]].\n\n==Biography==\nBates was born on 26 April 1850 in [[Stevenage]] in [[Hertfordshire]]. He began his career as a carver's assistant, and before beginning the regular study of plastic art he passed through a long apprenticeship in [[Architecture|architectural]] decoration working from 1869 for the firm of [[Farmer & Brindley]].\n\nIn 1879 he went to London and entered the [[South London School of Technical Art]] (formerly known as [[Lambeth School of Art]], now the [[City and Guilds of London Art School]]). There he studied under [[Jules Dalou]]<ref>[http://www.cityandguildsartschool.ac.uk/the_school/history/1854_1932_timeline City and Guilds of London Art School History] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111004090631/http://www.cityandguildsartschool.ac.uk/the_school/history/1854_1932_timeline |date=4 October 2011 }}</ref> and won a silver medal in the national competition at [[South Kensington]]. \nIn 1881, he was admitted to the [[Royal Academy schools]], where in 1883 he won the gold medal and the travelling scholarship with his relief of ''[[Socrates]] teaching the People in the Agora'', which showed grace of line and harmony of composition. He immediately went to [[Paris]], where he took up an independent studio (on Dalou's suggestion) in 1883&ndash;85. \nHe was influenced by Rodin, who advised him on occasion about his work. \nA head and three small bronze panels (the [[Aeneid]]), executed by Bates in Paris, were exhibited at the [[Royal Academy]], and selected for purchase by the [[Chantrey Bequest]] trustees; but the selection had to be cancelled because they had not been modelled in Britain.{{sfn|Radford|1901}}\n\nBates returned to Britain in 1886, and was elected to the [[Art Workers Guild]].\n\n[[File:Victoria Law Courts Birmingham door.jpg|thumb|Bates's figure of Victoria above the [[Victoria Law Courts, Birmingham]]]]\nHis ''[[Aeneas]]'' (1885), ''[[Homer]]'' (1886), three ''[[Psyche (mortal)|Psyche]]'' panels and [[Queen Rhodope|Rhodope]] (1887), all showed marked advance in form and dignity. Bates's primary skill lay in the composition and sculpting of relief sculpture, and it is in this medium that he achieved his most technically and aesthetically refined work. \nThe freestanding ideal sculpture remained the most important of sculptural genres, however, and Bates gradually turned to statues such as the 1889 ''Hounds in Leash,'' which is essentially a relief composition translated to three dimensions. In this work, Bates demonstrated his ability to convey muscular intensity and movement and led to his greater success and ambition. \n\nHis next major statue, the 1890 ''[[Pandora]]'', is more truly a figure in the round, and in this work Bates experimented with polychromy and mixed materials, making it self-consciously into a paradigmatic example of his artistic priorities. The box she holds is an actual decorative casket made of ivory and gilt bronze and elaborately carved with scenes from the Pandora legend. \nIt was exhibited in 1890 at the Royal Academy Summer Exhibition and purchased within the following year for the [[Francis Legatt Chantrey#Chantrey Bequest|Chantrey Bequest]].{{sfn|Radford|1901}}\n\nOne of his final commissions was a large bronze statue of [[Queen Victoria]] unveiled in Albert Square in [[Dundee]] shortly after his death.<ref>http://interactive.britishart.yale.edu/victoria-monuments/221/statue-of-queen-victoria</ref> This bronze statue was cast by the Parlanti foundry of London, who had also cast his statue of Lord Roberts in Calcutta.<ref>The West London Observer August 31st 1900\n</ref>\n\nHe died on 30 January 1899 at his residence, 10 Hall Road, St. John's Wood, N.W. He was buried at Stevenage on 4 February.{{sfn|Radford|1901}}\n\n==Assessment==\nThe portrait-busts of Harry Bates are good pieces of realism: strong, yet delicate in technique, and excellent in character. \nHis statues have a picturesqueness in which the refinement of the sculptor is always felt. Among the chief of these are the fanciful ''Maharaja of [[Kingdom of Mysore|Mysore]]'', somewhat overladen with ornament, and the colossal equestrian statue of ''[[Frederick Roberts, 1st Earl Roberts|Lord Roberts]]'' (1896) upon its important pedestal, girdled with a frieze of figures, now set up in [[Calcutta]], and a statue of [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Queen Victoria]] for [[Dundee]]. But perhaps his masterpiece\u2014in which his interest in polychromy and mixed materials in a format that fused decorative art and sculpture achieved its fullest realization\u2014was an allegorical presentment of ''Love and Life'', a winged male figure in [[bronze]], with a female figure in ivory being crowned by the male.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}\n\nBates died in London on 30 January 1899, his premature death robbing English plastic art of its most promising representative at the time.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}\nHe is primarily remembered as one of the most important sculptors working with the traditions of the decorative arts within the [[New Sculpture]] movement. \nBoth through his innovative use of polychromy and his allusive subject matter, he is often understood to be one of primary representatives of international Symbolism within British sculpture.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery style=\"text-align: center\" heights=\"150\" mode=packed>\nFile:Harry Bates - Pandora, 1891, left - on temporary display at Tate Britain, August 2010.png|Statue of ''[[Pandora]]'', 1891, owned by [[Tate Britain]], [[London]]\nFile:Boys with Coat of Arms by Harry Bates, Moorgate Place Entrance of Chartered Accountants' Hall.jpg|Boys with Coat of Arms, Moorgate Place Entrance of [[Chartered Accountants' Hall]]\nFile:Statue of Earl Roberts, Kelvingrove Park, Glasgow.jpg|Statue of [[Frederick Roberts, 1st Earl Roberts|Earl Roberts]], 1896, [[Kelvingrove Park]], [[Glasgow]]\nFile:Statue of Queen Victoria, Albert Square, Dundee by Harry Bates 1899.jpg|Statue of [[Queen Victoria]], 1899, [[Albert Square]], [[Dundee]]\nFile:EB1911 Plate III. v24, pg.504, Fig 4.jpg|Sculpture of [[Homer]], 1886<ref>[[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica]], ed. 1911, vol. 24, pg. 504, Plate III.</ref>\n</gallery>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n;Attribution\n*{{EB1911 |wstitle=Bates, Harry |volume=3 |page=509}}\n*{{DNBSupp|wstitle=Bates, Harry|volume=1|first=Ernest|last=Radford|pages=140\u2013141}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* Beattie, Susan.

He was elected to the [[Royal Academy]] in 1892 as A.R.A. and was an active, if intermittent, member of the [[Art Workers Guild]]. He was a central figure in the British movement known as [[New Sculpture]].\n\n==Biography==\nBates was born on 26 April 1850 in [[Stevenage]] in [[Hertfordshire]]. He began his career as a carver's assistant, and before beginning the regular study of plastic art he passed through a long apprenticeship in [[Architecture|architectural]] decoration working from 1869 for the firm of [[Farmer & Brindley]].\n\nIn 1879 he went to London and entered the [[South London School of Technical Art]] (formerly known as [[Lambeth School of Art]], now the [[City and Guilds of London Art School]]). There he studied under [[Jules Dalou]]<ref>[http://www.cityandguildsartschool.ac.uk/the_school/history/1854_1932_timeline City and Guilds of London Art School History] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111004090631/http://www.cityandguildsartschool.ac.uk/the_school/history/1854_1932_timeline |date=4 October 2011 }}</ref> and won a silver medal in the national competition at [[South Kensington]]. \nIn 1881, he was admitted to the [[Royal Academy schools]], where in 1883 he won the gold medal and the travelling scholarship with his relief of ''[[Socrates]] teaching the People in the Agora'', which showed grace of line and harmony of composition. He immediately went to [[Paris]], where he took up an independent studio (on Dalou's suggestion) in 1883&ndash;85. \nHe was influenced by Rodin, who advised him on occasion about his work. \nA head and three small bronze panels (the [[Aeneid]]), executed by Bates in Paris, were exhibited at the [[Royal Academy]], and selected for purchase by the [[Chantrey Bequest]] trustees; but the selection had to be cancelled because they had not been modelled in Britain.{{sfn|Radford|1901}}\n\nBates returned to Britain in 1886, and was elected to the [[Art Workers Guild]].\n\n[[File:Victoria Law Courts Birmingham door.jpg|thumb|Bates's figure of Victoria above the [[Victoria Law Courts, Birmingham]]]]\nHis ''[[Aeneas]]'' (1885), ''[[Homer]]'' (1886), three ''[[Psyche (mortal)|Psyche]]'' panels and [[Queen Rhodope|Rhodope]] (1887), all showed marked advance in form and dignity. Bates's primary skill lay in the composition and sculpting of relief sculpture, and it is in this medium that he achieved his most technically and aesthetically refined work. \nThe freestanding ideal sculpture remained the most important of sculptural genres, however, and Bates gradually turned to statues such as the 1889 ''Hounds in Leash,'' which is essentially a relief composition translated to three dimensions. In this work, Bates demonstrated his ability to convey muscular intensity and movement and led to his greater success and ambition. \n\nHis next major statue, the 1890 ''[[Pandora]]'', is more truly a figure in the round, and in this work Bates experimented with polychromy and mixed materials, making it self-consciously into a paradigmatic example of his artistic priorities. The box she holds is an actual decorative casket made of ivory and gilt bronze and elaborately carved with scenes from the Pandora legend. \nIt was exhibited in 1890 at the Royal Academy Summer Exhibition and purchased within the following year for the [[Francis Legatt Chantrey#Chantrey Bequest|Chantrey Bequest]].{{sfn|Radford|1901}}\n\nOne of his final commissions was a large bronze statue of [[Queen Victoria]] unveiled in Albert Square in [[Dundee]] shortly after his death.<ref>http://interactive.britishart.yale.edu/victoria-monuments/221/statue-of-queen-victoria</ref>\n\nHe died on 30 January 1899 at his residence, 10 Hall Road, St. John's Wood, N.W. He was buried at Stevenage on 4 February.{{sfn|Radford|1901}}\n\n==Assessment==\nThe portrait-busts of Harry Bates are good pieces of realism: strong, yet delicate in technique, and excellent in character. \nHis statues have a picturesqueness in which the refinement of the sculptor is always felt. Among the chief of these are the fanciful ''Maharaja of [[Kingdom of Mysore|Mysore]]'', somewhat overladen with ornament, and the colossal equestrian statue of ''[[Frederick Roberts, 1st Earl Roberts|Lord Roberts]]'' (1896) upon its important pedestal, girdled with a frieze of figures, now set up in [[Calcutta]], and a statue of [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Queen Victoria]] for [[Dundee]]. But perhaps his masterpiece\u2014in which his interest in polychromy and mixed materials in a format that fused decorative art and sculpture achieved its fullest realization\u2014was an allegorical presentment of ''Love and Life'', a winged male figure in [[bronze]], with a female figure in ivory being crowned by the male.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}\n\nBates died in London on 30 January 1899, his premature death robbing English plastic art of its most promising representative at the time.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}\nHe is primarily remembered as one of the most important sculptors working with the traditions of the decorative arts within the [[New Sculpture]] movement. \nBoth through his innovative use of polychromy and his allusive subject matter, he is often understood to be one of primary representatives of international Symbolism within British sculpture.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery style=\"text-align: center\" heights=\"150\" mode=packed>\nFile:Harry Bates - Pandora, 1891, left - on temporary display at Tate Britain, August 2010.png|Statue of ''[[Pandora]]'', 1891, owned by [[Tate Britain]], [[London]]\nFile:Boys with Coat of Arms by Harry Bates, Moorgate Place Entrance of Chartered Accountants' Hall.jpg|Boys with Coat of Arms, Moorgate Place Entrance of [[Chartered Accountants' Hall]]\nFile:Statue of Earl Roberts, Kelvingrove Park, Glasgow.jpg|Statue of [[Frederick Roberts, 1st Earl Roberts|Earl Roberts]], 1896, [[Kelvingrove Park]], [[Glasgow]]\nFile:Statue of Queen Victoria, Albert Square, Dundee by Harry Bates 1899.jpg|Statue of [[Queen Victoria]], 1899, [[Albert Square]], [[Dundee]]\nFile:EB1911 Plate III. v24, pg.504, Fig 4.jpg|Sculpture of [[Homer]], 1886<ref>[[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica]], ed. 1911, vol. 24, pg. 504, Plate III.</ref>\n</gallery>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n;Attribution\n*{{EB1911 |wstitle=Bates, Harry |volume=3 |page=509}}\n*{{DNBSupp|wstitle=Bates, Harry|volume=1|first=Ernest|last=Radford|pages=140\u2013141}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* Beattie, Susan.

In particular, the following areas exhibit a high degree of topographical variety: the eastern Midwest near the foothills of the [[Appalachian Mountains]]; the [[Great Lakes Basin]]; the heavily glaciated uplands of the [[North Shore (Lake Superior)|North Shore of Lake Superior]] in Minnesota, part of the ruggedly volcanic [[Canadian Shield]]; the [[Ozark Mountains]] of southern Missouri; and the deeply eroded [[Driftless Area]] of southwest Wisconsin, southeast Minnesota, northeast Iowa, and northwest Illinois.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}\n\nProceeding westward, the [[Appalachian Plateau]] topography gradually gives way to gently rolling hills and then (in central Ohio) to flat lands converted principally to farms and urban areas. This is the beginning of the vast Interior Plains of North America. As a result, [[prairie]]s cover most of the Great Plains states. Iowa and much of Illinois lie within an area called the ''prairie peninsula'', an eastward extension of prairies that borders [[conifer]] and mixed forests to the north, and [[hardwood]] [[deciduous]] forests to the east and south.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}\n\nGeographers subdivide the Interior Plains into the Interior Lowlands and the Great Plains on the basis of elevation. The Lowlands are mostly below {{convert|1,500|ft|m}} above sea level whereas the Great Plains to the west are higher, rising in [[Colorado]] to around {{convert|5,000|ft|m}}.\nThe Lowlands, then, are confined to parts of Iowa, Illinois, Indiana, Ohio, Michigan, [[Tennessee]], and [[Kentucky]]. Missouri and [[Arkansas]] have regions of Lowlands elevations, contrasting with their Ozark region (within the Interior Highlands). Eastern Ohio's hills are an extension of the Appalachian Plateau.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}\n\nThe Interior Plains are largely coincident with the vast [[Mississippi River]] Drainage System (other major components are the [[Missouri River|Missouri]] and Ohio Rivers). These rivers have for tens of millions of years been eroding downward into the mostly horizontal sedimentary rocks of [[Paleozoic]], [[Mesozoic]], and [[Cenozoic]] ages. The modern Mississippi River system has developed during the Pleistocene Epoch of the Cenozoic.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}\n\nRainfall decreases from east to west, resulting in different types of prairies, with the [[tallgrass prairie]] in the wetter eastern region, mixed-grass prairie in the central [[Great Plains]], and [[shortgrass prairie]] towards the [[rain shadow]] of the Rockies.

They made canoes for fishing. Most of them lived in oval or conical [[wigwam]]s that could be easily moved away. Various tribes had different ways of living. The Ojibwas were primarily hunters and fishing was also important in the Ojibwas economy. Other tribes such as Sac, Fox, and Miami, both hunted and farmed.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}\n\nThey were oriented toward the open prairies where they engaged in communal hunts for [[American Bison|buffalo (bison)]]. In the northern forests, the Ottawas and Potawatomis separated into small family groups for hunting.

All tribes were governed under chiefdoms or complex chiefdoms. For example, Hurons were divided into matrilineal clans, each represented by a chief in the town council, where they met with a town chief on civic matters. But Chippewa people's social and political life was simpler than that of settled tribes.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}\n\nThe religious beliefs varied among tribes. Hurons believed in ''Yoscaha'', a supernatural being who lived in the sky and was believed to have created the world and the Huron people. At death, Hurons thought the soul left the body to live in a village in the sky. Chippewas were a deeply religious people who believed in the Great Spirit. They worshiped the Great Spirit through all their seasonal activities, and viewed religion as a private matter: Each person's relation with his personal guardian spirit was part of his thinking every day of life. Ottawa and Potawatomi people had very similar religious beliefs to those of the Chippewas.<ref name=Midwestlit />\n\nIn the Ohio River Valley, the dominant food supply was not hunting but agriculture.

Some tribes are described as part of the 'Buffalo Culture' (sometimes called, for the [[American Bison]]). Although the Plains Indians hunted other animals, such as [[elk]] or [[Pronghorn|antelope]], bison was their primary game food source.

Most of them started as farmers, but later the larger proportion moved to towns and cities as entrepreneurs, businessmen, and urban professionals. Since its beginnings in the 1830s, Chicago has grown to dominate the Midwestern metropolis landscape for over a century.<ref>\"Yankees\" in Reiff, ed. ''Encyclopedia of Chicago''</ref>\n\nHistorian John Bunker has examined the worldview of the Yankee settlers in the Midwest:\n\n<blockquote>Because they arrived first and had a strong sense of community and mission, Yankees were able to transplant New England institutions, values, and mores, altered only by the conditions of frontier life. They established a public culture that emphasized the work ethic, the sanctity of private property, individual responsibility, faith in residential and social mobility, practicality, piety, public order and decorum, reverence for public education, activists, honest, and frugal government, town meeting democracy, and he believed that there was a public interest that transcends particular and stick ambitions. Regarding themselves as the elect and just in a world rife with sin, air, and corruption, they felt a strong moral obligation to define and enforce standards of community and personal behavior....This pietistic worldview was substantially shared by British, Scandinavian, Swiss, English-Canadian and Dutch Reformed immigrants, as well as by German Protestants and many of the Forty-Eighters.<ref>John Buenker, \"Wisconsin\" in {{cite book|last=James H. Madison, ed. |title=Heartland: Comparative Histories of the Midwestern States |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TMUCo0UXCjoC&pg=PA72|year=1988|publisher=Indiana University Press|pages=72\u201373|isbn=978-0253314239}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nMidwestern politics pitted Yankees against the German Catholics and Lutherans, who were often led by the Irish Catholics. These large groups, Buenker argues:\n\n<blockquote>Generally subscribed to the work ethic, a strong sense of community, and activist government, but were less committed to economic individualism and privatism and ferociously opposed to government supervision of the personal habits. Southern and eastern European immigrants generally leaned more toward the Germanic view of things, while modernization, industrialization, and urbanization modified nearly everyone's sense of individual economic responsibility and put a premium on organization, political involvement, and education.<ref>John Buenker, \"Wisconsin\"</ref><ref>Richard J. Jensen, ''Illinois: a Bicentennial history'' (1977) ch 1-3</ref></blockquote>\n\n=== Development of transportation ===\n==== Waterways ====\n[[File:LightningVolt Lake Michigan Sunset.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|[[Lake Michigan]] is shared by four Midwestern states: Michigan, Indiana, Illinois, and Wisconsin.]]\nThree waterways have been important to the development of the Midwest. The first and foremost was the [[Ohio River]], which flowed into the [[Mississippi River]]. Development of the region was halted until 1795 by [[Spain]]'s control of the southern part of the Mississippi and its refusal to allow the shipment of American crops down the river and into the [[Atlantic Ocean]].{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}\n\nThe second waterway is the network of routes within the Great Lakes. The opening of the [[Erie Canal]] in 1825 completed an all-water shipping route, more direct than the Mississippi, to [[New York (state)|New York]] and the seaport of [[New York City]]. In 1848, The [[Illinois and Michigan Canal]] breached the [[continental divide]] spanning the [[Chicago Portage]] and linking the waters of the Great Lakes with those of the [[Mississippi Valley]] and the [[Gulf of Mexico]]. Lakeport and river cities grew up to handle these new shipping routes. During the [[Industrial Revolution]], the lakes became a conduit for [[iron ore]] from the [[Mesabi Range]] of Minnesota to [[steel mill]]s in the [[Mid-Atlantic States]]. The [[Saint Lawrence Seaway]], completed in 1959, opened the Midwest to the Atlantic Ocean.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.encyclopedia.com/places/united-states-and-canada/canadian-physical-geography/saint-lawrence-seaway|title=Saint Lawrence Seaway|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nThe third waterway, the [[Missouri River]], extended water travel from the Mississippi almost to the Rocky Mountains.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}\n\n[[File:Efmo View from Fire Point.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|The [[Upper Mississippi River]] near [[Harpers Ferry, Iowa]]]]\nIn the 1870s and 1880s, the Mississippi River inspired two classic books\u2014''[[Life on the Mississippi]]'' and ''[[Adventures of Huckleberry Finn]]''\u2014written by native Missourian Samuel Clemens, who used the pseudonym [[Mark Twain]]. His stories became staples of Midwestern lore. Twain's hometown of [[Hannibal, Missouri]], is a tourist attraction offering a glimpse into the Midwest of his time.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}\n\nInland canals in Ohio and Indiana constituted another important waterway, which connected with Great Lakes and Ohio River traffic. The commodities that the Midwest funneled into the [[Erie Canal]] down the Ohio River contributed to the wealth of New York City, which overtook [[Boston]] and [[Philadelphia]].{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}\n\n==== Railroads and the automobile ====\nDuring the mid-19th century, the region got its first railroads, and the railroad junction in Chicago became the world's largest. During the century, Chicago became the nation's railroad center. By 1910, over 20 railroads operated passenger service out of six different downtown terminals. Even today, a century after [[Henry Ford]], six [[Class I railroad]]s meet in Chicago.{{sfnp|Condit|1973|pp=43-49, 58, 318-319}}<ref>{{Holland-Classic|pages = 66\u201391}}</ref>\n\nIn the period from 1890 to 1930, many Midwestern cities were connected by electric [[interurban]] railroads, similar to streetcars. The Midwest had more interurbans than any other region. In 1916, Ohio led all states with {{convert|2,798|mi|km}}, Indiana followed with {{convert|1,825|mi|km}}.

The regional southern boundary was the Ohio River, the border of freedom and slavery in American history and literature (see ''[[Uncle Tom's Cabin]]'' by [[Harriet Beecher Stowe]] and ''[[Beloved (novel)|Beloved]]'' by [[Toni Morrison]]).\n\nThe Midwest, particularly Ohio, provided the primary routes for the ''[[Underground Railroad]]'', whereby Midwesterners assisted slaves to freedom from their crossing of the Ohio River through their departure on [[Lake Erie]] to Canada. Created in the early 19th century, the Underground Railroad was at its height between 1850 and 1860. One estimate suggests that by 1850, 100,000 slaves had escaped via the Underground Railroad.<ref name=\"afroamhistory\">[http://afroamhistory.about.com/od/undergroundrailroad/a/undergroundrr.htm The Fugitive Slave Law] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090125175114/http://afroamhistory.about.com/od/undergroundrailroad/a/undergroundrr.htm |date=25 January 2009 }} African-American History, pp. 1\u20132. About.com</ref>\n\nThe Underground Railroad consisted of meeting points, secret routes, transportation, and safe houses and assistance provided by abolitionist sympathizers. Individuals were often organized in small, independent groups; this helped to maintain secrecy because individuals knew some connecting \"stations\" along the route, but knew few details of their immediate area. Escaped slaves would move north along the route from one way station to the next. Although the fugitives sometimes traveled on boat or train, they usually traveled on foot or by wagon.<ref>Bordewich, Fergus, 2005, p. 236</ref>\n\nThe region was shaped by the relative absence of slavery (except for Missouri), pioneer settlement, education in [[one-room school|one-room free public schools]], democratic notions brought by [[American Revolutionary War]] veterans, [[Protestant]] faiths and experimentation, and agricultural wealth transported on the Ohio River [[riverboat]]s, [[flatboat]]s, [[Barge|canal boats]], and [[rail transport|railroads]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}}\n\n==== Bleeding Kansas ====\n{{Main|Bleeding Kansas}}\n\nThe first violent conflicts leading up to the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] occurred between two neighboring Midwestern states, Kansas and Missouri, involving [[Abolitionism in the United States|anti-slavery]] [[Free-Stater (Kansas)|Free-Staters]] and pro-slavery \"[[Border Ruffian]]\" elements, that took place in the [[Kansas Territory]] and the western frontier towns of Missouri roughly between 1854 and 1858. At the heart of the conflict was the question of whether Kansas would enter the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] as a free state or slave state. As such, [[Bleeding Kansas]] was a [[proxy war]] between [[Northern United States|Northerners]] and [[Southern United States|Southerners]] over the issue of [[slavery in the United States|slavery]]. The term \"Bleeding Kansas\" was coined by [[Horace Greeley]] of the ''[[New York Tribune]]''; the events it encompasses directly presaged the Civil War.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}\n\n[[File:Bleeding Kansas Poster.jpg|thumb|upright|1855 [[Free-Stater (Kansas)|Free-State]] poster]]\nSetting in motion the events later known as \"Bleeding Kansas\" was the [[Kansas-Nebraska Act of 1854|Kansas-Nebraska Act]]. The Act created the territories of Kansas and Nebraska, opened new lands that would help settlement in them, repealed the [[Missouri Compromise of 1820|Missouri Compromise]], and allowed settlers in those territories to determine through [[Popular sovereignty in the United States|popular sovereignty]] whether to allow slavery within their boundaries. It was hoped the Act would ease relations between the North and the South, because the South could expand slavery to new territories, but the North still had the right to abolish slavery in its states. Instead, opponents denounced the law as a concession to the [[The Slave Power|slave power]] of the South.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}\n\nThe new [[History of the United States Republican Party|Republican Party]], born in the Midwest ([[Ripon, Wisconsin]], 1854) and created in opposition to the Act, aimed to stop the expansion of slavery, and soon emerged as the dominant force throughout the North.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.masslive.com/history/index.ssf/2011/05/springfields_375th_from_puritans_to_presidents.html|title=Springfield's 375th: From Puritans to presidents|website=Masslive.com|access-date=2017-07-16}}</ref>\n\nAn ostensibly [[democracy|democratic]] idea, popular sovereignty stated that the inhabitants of each territory or state should decide whether it would be a free or slave state; however, this resulted in immigration ''en masse'' to Kansas by activists from both sides. At one point, Kansas had two separate governments, each with its own constitution, although only one was federally recognized. On January 29, 1861, Kansas was admitted to the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] as a free state, less than three months before the [[Battle of Fort Sumter]] officially began the Civil War.<ref>Robert W. Johansson, ''Stephen A. Douglas '' (Oxford UP, 1973) pp&nbsp;374\u2013400</ref>\n\nThe calm in Kansas was shattered in May 1856 by two events that are often regarded as the opening shots of the Civil War. On May 21, the [[Free Soil Party|Free Soil]] town of [[Lawrence, Kansas|Lawrence]], Kansas, was sacked by an armed pro\u2010slavery force from Missouri. A few days later, the [[Sacking of Lawrence]] led [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionist]] [[John Brown (abolitionist)|John Brown]] and six of his followers to execute five men along the [[Pottawatomie massacre|Pottawatomie Creek]] in [[Franklin County, Kansas|Franklin County]], Kansas, in retaliation.<ref>[https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/aia/part4/4p2952.html Africans in America Resource Bank: People and Events, 1853\u20131861, online].

Though most battles were fought in the South, skirmishes between Kansas and Missouri continued until culmination with the [[Lawrence Massacre]] on August 21, 1863. Also known as Quantrill's Raid, the massacre was a rebel guerrilla attack by [[Quantrill's Raiders]], led by William Clarke Quantrill, on pro-Union Lawrence, Kansas.

In 1789, the [[Northwest Ordinance]] was enacted, creating the [[Northwest Territory]], which was bounded by the Great Lakes and the Ohio and Mississippi Rivers. Because the Northwest Territory lay between the East Coast and the then-far-West, the states carved out of it were called the ''Northwest''. In the early 19th century, anything west of the Mississippi River was considered the West. The first recorded use of the term ''Midwestern'' to refer to a region of the central U.S. occurred in 1886, ''Midwest'' appeared in 1894, and ''Midwesterner'' in 1916.<ref name=\"oed.com\">[[Oxford English Dictionary]] entries for ''Midwestern'', ''Midwest'', and ''Midwesterner'', http://www.oed.com/</ref>\n\nSome maintain that only the areas that made up the Northwest Territory can truly be called the Midwest, and that all other areas to the west should be properly labeled as part of the \"Great Plains\" region instead. But following the settlement of the western prairie, others considered the row of states from North Dakota to Kansas to be part of the Midwest as well.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.loc.gov/item/ihas.200197407 |title=Regional Song Sampler: The Midwest &#124; Library of Congress |website=Loc.gov |date= |accessdate=2017-07-16}}</ref>\n\nThe states of the \"old Northwest\" are now called the \"East North Central States\" by the United States Census Bureau, with the \"Great Lakes region\" being also a popular term.

In cooler regions, wheat was often the crop of choice when lands were newly settled, leading to a \"wheat frontier\" that moved westward over the course of years. Also very common in the antebellum Midwest was farming corn while raising [[Hog (swine)|hogs]], complementing each other especially since it was difficult to get grain to market before the canals and railroads. After the \"wheat frontier\" had passed through an area, more diversified farms including [[dairy cattle|dairy]] and [[beef cattle]] generally took its place.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}\n\nThe very dense soil of the Midwest plagued the first settlers who were using wooden [[Plough|plows]], which were more suitable for loose forest soil. On the prairie, the plows bounced around and the soil stuck to them. This problem was solved in 1837 by an Illinois [[blacksmith]] named [[John Deere (inventor)|John Deere]] who developed a [[steel]] moldboard plow that was stronger and cut the roots, making the fertile soils of the prairie ready for farming.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}\n\nThe tallgrass prairie has been converted into one of the most intensive crop producing areas in [[North America]].

Freed's contribution in identifying rock as a new genre helped establish the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]], located in Cleveland. [[Chuck Berry]], a Midwesterner from St. Louis, was among the first successful [[rock and roll]] artists and influenced many other rock musicians.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}\n\nNotable soul and R&B musicians associated with Motown that had their origins in the area include [[Aretha Franklin]], [[The Supremes]], [[Mary Wells]], [[Four Tops]], [[The Jackson 5]], [[The Miracles|Smokey Robinson & the Miracles]], [[Stevie Wonder]], [[The Marvelettes]], [[The Temptations]], and [[Martha and the Vandellas]]. These artists achieved their greatest success in the 1960s and 1970s.\n\nIn the 1970s and 1980s, native Midwestern musicians such as [[John Mellencamp]] and [[Bob Seger]] found great success with a style of rock music that came to be known as [[heartland rock]], which were characterized by lyrical themes that focused on and appealed to the Midwestern working class. Other successful Midwestern rock artists emerged during this time, including [[Cheap Trick]], [[REO Speedwagon]], [[Steve Miller (musician)|Steve Miller]], [[Styx (band)|Styx]], and [[Kansas (band)|Kansas]].{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}.\n\nIn the 1990s, the Chicago-based band [[The Smashing Pumpkins]] emerged, and went on to become one of the most successful alternative rock artists of the decade. Also in the 1990s, the Midwest was at the center of the emerging [[Midwest emo]] movement, with bands like [[The Get Up Kids]] (Missouri), [[Cursive (band)|Cursive]] (Nebraska), and [[Cap'n Jazz]] (Illinois) blending earlier hard-core punk sounds with a more melodic indie rock sentiment. This hybrid of styles came to be known as Midwest emo. Chicago-based artists [[Fall Out Boy]] and [[Plain White T]]'s popularized the genre in the early part of the 21st century.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}\n\nIn the late 1990s, [[Eminem]] and [[Kid Rock]] emerged from the Detroit area. Eminem went on to become one of the most commercially successful and critically acclaimed rappers of all time.

Both artists are known for celebrating their Detroit roots.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}\n\n[[House Music]] and [[Techno]] both had their roots in Chicago and Detroit respectively in the mid-to-late 1980s.

divided states often deciding the national result. In 1860\u20131920, both parties often selected either their president or vice president from the region.<ref>{{cite book |first=Lewis L. |last=Gould |title=Grand Old Party: A History of the Republicans |edition=2nd |year=2012 |page=126 }}</ref>\n\n[[File:Little White Schoolhouse Ripon Wisconsin Feb 2012.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|The first local meeting of the new Republican Party took place here in [[Ripon, Wisconsin]] on March 20, 1854.]]\nOne of the two major political parties in the United States, the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]], originated in the Midwest in the 1850s; Ripon, Wisconsin had the first local meeting while [[Jackson, Michigan]] had the state county meeting of the new party. Its membership included many [[Yankee]]s who had settled the upper Midwest. The party opposed the expansion of slavery and stressed the Protestant ideals of thrift, a hard work ethic, self-reliance, democratic decision making, and religious tolerance.<ref>{{cite book |last=Gould |title=Grand Old Party: A History of the Republicans |edition=2nd |year=2012 |page=14 }}</ref>\n\nIn the early 1890s the wheat-growing regions were strongholds of the short-lived [[People's Party (United States)|Populist movement]] in the Plains states.<ref>{{cite book |first=Russel B. |last=Nye |title=Midwestern Progressive Politics |year=1968 }}</ref>\n\nStarting in the 1890s the middle class urban [[Progressive movement]] became influential in the region (as it was in other regions), with Wisconsin a major center. Under the [[Robert M. La Follette, Sr.|La Follettes]] Wisconsin fought against the GOP bosses and for efficiency, modernization, and the use of experts to solve social, economic, and political problems. Theodore Roosevelt's [[Progressive Party (United States, 1912)|1912 Progressive Party]] had the best showing in this region; carrying the states of Michigan, Minnesota, and South Dakota. In 1924, La Follette, Sr.'s [[Progressive Party (United States, 1924\u201334)|1924 Progressive Party]] did well in the region, but only carried his home base of Wisconsin.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}\n\nThe Midwest\u2014especially the areas west of Chicago\u2014has always been a stronghold of [[United States non-interventionism|isolationism]], a belief that America should not involve itself in foreign entanglements. This position was largely based on the many [[German American]] and [[Swedish-American]] communities. Isolationist leaders included the La Follettes, Ohio's [[Robert A. Taft]], and [[Robert R. McCormick|Colonel Robert McCormick]], publisher of the ''Chicago Tribune''.<ref>{{cite journal |first=Ralph H. |last=Smuckler |title=The Region of Isolationism |journal=[[American Political Science Review]] |year=1953 |volume=47 |issue=2 |pages=386\u2013401 |jstor=1952029 |doi=10.2307/1952029 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |first=John N. |last=Schacht |title=Three Faces of Midwestern Isolationism: Gerald P.

Upper Midwestern states of Illinois, Michigan, Minnesota, and Wisconsin reliably voted Democratic in every presidential election from 1992 to 2012. The Great Plains states of North Dakota, South Dakota, Nebraska, and Kansas have voted for the Republican candidate in every presidential election since 1940, except for Democrat [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] in [[1964 United States presidential election|1964]]. Indiana is usually considered a Republican stronghold, voting that party's presidential candidate in every election since 1940, except for Johnson in 1964 and [[Barack Obama]] in 2008.<ref>{{cite web |title=Election Statistics, 1920 to Present |url=http://history.house.gov/Institution/Election-Statistics/Election-Statistics/ |website=History, Art & Archives: US House of Representatives |accessdate=30 July 2018}}</ref>\n\nAs a result of the 2016 elections, Republicans controlled the governors' office in all Midwestern states except Minnesota and the Republicans also controlled every partisan state legislature in the Midwest except [[Illinois state legislature|Illinois]]. The unicameral [[Nebraska Legislature]] is officially nonpartisan.<ref>{{cite web |title=Unicam Focus |url=https://nebraskalegislature.gov/education/lesson3.php |website=Nebraska Legislature |accessdate=30 July 2018}}</ref> In 2018, however, the Democrats made a significant comeback by flipping the gubernatorial elections in [[Illinois gubernatorial election, 2018|Illinois]], [[Kansas gubernatorial election, 2018|Kansas]], [[Michigan gubernatorial election, 2018|Michigan]] and [[Wisconsin gubernatorial election, 2018|Wisconsin]]. The Democrats also flipped the [[Minnesota House of Representatives]] after losing control in [[United States elections, 2014|2014]].\n\nThe state government of Illinois currently has a Democratic Governor [[J. B. Pritzker|J.B. Pritzker]] and [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] super majorities in the state house and state senate. The state currently has two Democratic senators, and a 13\u20135 Democratic majority U.S. House of Representatives delegation.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}\n\nMany analysts{{who|date=May 2016}} consider Iowa the most evenly divided state in the country, but it has leaned Democratic for at least the past fifteen years.{{when|date=May 2016}} Iowa had a Democratic governor from 1999 until [[Terry Branstad]] was re-elected in the mid-term elections in 2010, and has had both one Democratic and one Republican senator since the early 1980s until the 2014 election when Republican [[Joni Ernst]] defeated Democrat [[Bruce Braley]] in a tightly contested race.<ref>{{cite web|title = Dave Leip's Atlas of U.S. Presidential Elections|url = http://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS/|website = uselectionatlas.org|access-date = 2016-02-15|first = David|last = Leip}}</ref> As for Iowa's House delegation, Democrats currently hold a 3 to 1 seat majority as a result of the 2018 elections. Between 1992 and 2012, Iowa also voted for the Democratic presidential candidate in all elections except 2004, but in 2016 the state went to the Republicans by 10 percentage points. As a result of the 2016 elections, Republicans hold a majority in the [[Iowa House of Representatives]] and the [[Iowa Senate]].{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}\n\nMinnesota voters have not voted for a Republican candidate for president since 1972, longer than any other state. Minnesota was the only U.S. state (along with Washington, D.C.) to vote for its native son [[Walter Mondale]] over [[Ronald Reagan]] in 1984. However, the recent{{when|date=May 2016}} Democratic victories have often been fairly narrow, such as the 2016 Presidential Election. Minnesota also elected and re-elected a Republican governor ([[Tim Pawlenty]]), as well as supported some of the strongest [[Concealed carry in the United States|gun concealment]] laws in the nation.\n\nConsistently, Ohio is a battleground state in presidential elections. No Republican has won the office without winning Ohio. This trend has contributed to Ohio's reputation as a quintessential swing state. At the state level, however, Republicans are currently dominant. With the exception of one justice of the [[Supreme Court of Ohio]], all political offices open to statewide election are held by Republicans. Republicans have a majority in the [[Ohio House of Representatives]] and a supermajority in the [[Ohio Senate]]. At the federal level, Ohio currently has one Democratic and one Republican U.S. Senator.{{when|date=May 2016}} As a result of the 2012 elections, 12 of Ohio's 16 members of the [[U.S. House of Representatives]] are Republicans.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}\n\nThe Great Plains states of North Dakota, South Dakota, Nebraska, and Kansas have been strongholds for the Republicans for many decades. These four states have gone for the Republican candidate in every presidential election since 1940, except for [[Lyndon B. Johnson]]'s landslide over [[Barry Goldwater]] in [[1964 United States presidential election|1964]]. Although North Dakota and South Dakota have often elected Democrats to Congress, after the 2012 election both states' congressional delegations are majority Republican. Nebraska has elected Democrats to the Senate and as governor in recent years, but both of its senators are Republican.{{when|date=May 2016}} Kansas has elected a majority of Democrats as governor since 1956, but has not elected a Democratic senator since 1932. Both of Kansas's U.S. Senators and all four of its U.S. House members are Republican.{{when|date=May 2016}}\n\nMissouri was historically considered a \"bellwether state\", having voted for the winner in every presidential election since 1904, with three exceptions: in [[1956 United States presidential election|1956]] for Democrat [[Adlai Stevenson II]]; in [[2008 United States presidential election|2008]] for Republican [[John McCain]]; and in [[2012 United States presidential election|2012]] for Republican [[Mitt Romney]]. Missouri's House delegation has generally been evenly divided, with the Democrats holding sway in the large cities at the opposite ends of the state, Kansas City and St. Louis (although the Kansas City suburbs are now trending Republican), and the Republicans controlling the rest of the state, save for a pocket of Democratic strength in [[Columbia, Missouri|Columbia]], home to the [[University of Missouri]]. However, as a result of the 2012 elections, Republicans now have a 6\u20132 majority in the state's House delegation, with African-American Democrats representing the major cities. Missouri's Senate seats were mostly controlled by Democrats until the latter part of the 20th century, but the Republicans have held one or both Senate seats continuously since 1976.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}\n\nAll Midwestern states use primary election to select delegates for both the Democratic and Republican national conventions, except for Iowa. The [[Iowa caucuses]] in early January of leap years are the first votes in the [[United States presidential election|presidential nominating process]] for both major parties, and attract enormous media attention.<ref>David P.

Tolbert]], and Todd Donovan, ''Why Iowa?: how caucuses and sequential elections improve the presidential nominating process'' (2011)</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Cuisine of the Midwestern United States]]\n* [[Territories of the United States on stamps]]\n\n=== Other regions of the United States ===\n* [[Southeastern United States]]\n* [[South Central United States]]\n* [[Western United States]]\n* [[Northeastern United States]]\n\n== Bibliography ==\n* Frederick; John T., ed.

The states of the Old Northwest are also known as ''[[Great Lakes region (North America)|Great Lakes states]]'' and are east-north central in the United States. The Ohio River runs along the southeastern section while the Mississippi River runs north to south near the center. Many of the Louisiana Purchase states in the west-north central United States, are also known as the '''Great Plains states''', where the Missouri River is a major waterway joining with the Mississippi. The Midwest lies north of the [[Parallel 36\u00b030\u2032 north|36\u00b030\u2032 parallel]] that the 1820 [[Missouri Compromise]] established as the dividing line between future [[Slave and free states|slave and non-slave states]].{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}\n\nThe Midwest Region is defined by the [[United States Census Bureau|U.S. Census Bureau]] as these 12 states:<ref name=census.gov />\n* '''[[Illinois]]:''' Old Northwest, Mississippi River (Missouri River joins near the state border), Ohio River, and Great Lakes state\n* '''[[Indiana]]:''' Old Northwest, Ohio River, and Great Lakes state\n* '''[[Iowa]]:''' Louisiana Purchase, Mississippi River, and Missouri River state\n* '''[[Kansas]]:''' Louisiana Purchase, Great Plains, and Missouri River state\n* '''[[Michigan]]:''' Old Northwest and Great Lakes state\n* '''[[Minnesota]]:''' Old Northwest, Louisiana Purchase, Mississippi River, part of [[Red River Colony]] before 1818, Great Lakes state\n* '''[[Missouri]]:''' Louisiana Purchase, Mississippi River (Ohio River joins near the state border), Missouri River, and [[Border states (American Civil War)|border]] state\n* '''[[Nebraska]]:''' Louisiana Purchase, Great Plains, and Missouri River state\n* '''[[North Dakota]]:''' Louisiana Purchase, part of Red River Colony before 1818, Great Plains, and Missouri River state\n* '''[[Ohio]]:''' Old Northwest (Historic [[Connecticut Western Reserve]]), Ohio River, and Great Lakes state.

Most of its eastern two-thirds form the [[Geography of the Interior United States|Interior Lowlands]]. The Lowlands gradually rise westward, from a line passing through eastern Kansas, up to over {{convert|5,000|ft|m}} in the unit known as the [[Great Plains]]. Most of the Great Plains area is now farmed.<ref name=\"Remote Sensing Tutorial\">{{cite web|url=http://rst.gsfc.nasa.gov/Sect6/Sect6_4.html|title=Remote Sensing Tutorial, Section 6, online|accessdate=June 9, 2011}}</ref>\n\nWhile these states are for the most part relatively flat, consisting either of plains or of rolling and small hills, there is a measure of geographical variation. In particular, the following areas exhibit a high degree of topographical variety: the eastern Midwest near the foothills of the [[Appalachian Mountains]]; the [[Great Lakes Basin]]; the heavily glaciated uplands of the [[North Shore (Lake Superior)|North Shore of Lake Superior]] in Minnesota, part of the ruggedly volcanic [[Canadian Shield]]; the [[Ozark Mountains]] of southern Missouri; and the deeply eroded [[Driftless Area]] of southwest Wisconsin, southeast Minnesota, northeast Iowa, and northwest Illinois.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}\n\nProceeding westward, the [[Appalachian Plateau]] topography gradually gives way to gently rolling hills and then (in central Ohio) to flat lands converted principally to farms and urban areas. This is the beginning of the vast Interior Plains of North America. As a result, [[prairie]]s cover most of the Great Plains states. Iowa and much of Illinois lie within an area called the ''prairie peninsula'', an eastward extension of prairies that borders [[conifer]] and mixed forests to the north, and [[hardwood]] [[deciduous]] forests to the east and south.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}\n\nGeographers subdivide the Interior Plains into the Interior Lowlands and the Great Plains on the basis of elevation. The Lowlands are mostly below {{convert|1,500|ft|m}} above sea level whereas the Great Plains to the west are higher, rising in [[Colorado]] to around {{convert|5,000|ft|m}}.\nThe Lowlands, then, are confined to parts of Iowa, Illinois, Indiana, Ohio, Michigan, [[Tennessee]], and [[Kentucky]]. Missouri and [[Arkansas]] have regions of Lowlands elevations, contrasting with their Ozark region (within the Interior Highlands). Eastern Ohio\u2019s hills are an extension of the Appalachian Plateau.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}\n\nThe Interior Plains are largely coincident with the vast [[Mississippi River]] Drainage System (other major components are the [[Missouri River|Missouri]] and Ohio Rivers). These rivers have for tens of millions of years been eroding downward into the mostly horizontal sedimentary rocks of [[Paleozoic]], [[Mesozoic]], and [[Cenozoic]] ages. The modern Mississippi River system has developed during the Pleistocene Epoch of the Cenozoic.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}\n\nRainfall decreases from east to west, resulting in different types of prairies, with the [[tallgrass prairie]] in the wetter eastern region, mixed-grass prairie in the central [[Great Plains]], and [[shortgrass prairie]] towards the [[rain shadow]] of the Rockies. Today, these three prairie types largely correspond to the [[Maize|corn]]/[[soybean]] area, the [[wheat]] belt, and the western rangelands, respectively.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}\n\nMuch of the [[coniferous forests]] of the Upper Midwest were clear-cut in the late 19th century, and mixed hardwood forests have become a major component of the new woodlands since then.

Archaeological evidence indicates that [[Mississippian culture]] traits probably began in the [[St. Louis, Missouri]] area and spread northwest along the Mississippi and Illinois rivers and entered the state along the [[Kankakee River]] system.

They brought with them a well-developed agricultural complex based on three major crops\u2014[[maize]], [[beans]], and [[squash (plant)|squash]]. Maize, or corn, was the primary crop of Mississippian farmers. They gathered a wide variety of seeds, nuts, and berries, and fished and hunted for fowl to supplement their diets. With such an intensive form of [[agriculture]], this culture supported large populations.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}\n\nThe Mississippi period was characterized by a [[mound builder (people)|mound-building]] culture. The Mississippians suffered a tremendous population decline about 1400, coinciding with the global climate change of the [[Little Ice Age]].

They made canoes for fishing. Most of them lived in oval or conical [[wigwam]]s that could be easily moved away. Various tribes had different ways of living. The Ojibwas were primarily hunters and fishing was also important in the Ojibwas economy. Other tribes such as Sac, Fox, and Miami, both hunted and farmed.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}\n\nThey were oriented toward the open prairies where they engaged in communal hunts for [[American Bison|buffalo (bison)]]. In the northern forests, the Ottawas and Potawatomis separated into small family groups for hunting. The Winnebagos and Menominees used both hunting methods interchangeably and built up widespread trade networks extending as far west as the Rockies, north to the Great Lakes, south to the [[Gulf of Mexico]], and east to the [[Atlantic Ocean]].{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}\n\nThe Hurons reckoned descent through the female line, while the others favored the patrilineal method. All tribes were governed under chiefdoms or complex chiefdoms. For example, Hurons were divided into matrilineal clans, each represented by a chief in the town council, where they met with a town chief on civic matters. But Chippewa people's social and political life was simpler than that of settled tribes.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}\n\nThe religious beliefs varied among tribes. Hurons believed in ''Yoscaha'', a supernatural being who lived in the sky and was believed to have created the world and the Huron people. At death, Hurons thought the soul left the body to live in a village in the sky. Chippewas were a deeply religious people who believed in the Great Spirit. They worshiped the Great Spirit through all their seasonal activities, and viewed religion as a private matter: Each person's relation with his personal guardian spirit was part of his thinking every day of life. Ottawa and Potawatomi people had very similar religious beliefs to those of the Chippewas.<ref name=Midwestlit />\n\nIn the Ohio River Valley, the dominant food supply was not hunting but agriculture.

The first group were fully nomadic, following the vast herds of [[American bison|buffalo]]. Some tribes occasionally engaged in agriculture, growing tobacco and corn primarily. These included the [[Blackfoot]], [[Arapaho]], [[Assiniboine people|Assiniboine]], [[Cheyenne]], [[Comanche]], [[Crow Nation|Crow]], [[Gros Ventres|Gros Ventre]], [[Kiowa]], [[Lakota people|Lakota]], [[Lipan Apache people|Lipan]], [[Plains Apache]] (or Kiowa Apache), [[Plains Cree]], [[Saulteaux|Plains Ojibwe]], [[Tsuu T'ina Nation|Sarsi]], [[Shoshone]], [[Nakoda (people)|Stoney]], and [[Tonkawa]].{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}\n\nThe second group of Plains Indians (sometimes referred to as Prairie Indians) were the semi-sedentary tribes who, in addition to hunting buffalo, lived in villages and raised crops. These included the [[Arikara]], [[Hidatsa]], [[Iowa tribe|Iowa]], [[Kaw (tribe)|Kaw (or Kansa)]], [[Kichai people|Kitsai]], [[Mandan]], [[Missouria]], [[Nez Perce tribe|Nez Perce]], [[Omaha (tribe)|Omaha]], [[Osage Nation|Osage]], [[Otoe tribe|Otoe]], [[Pawnee people|Pawnee]], [[Ponca]], [[Quapaw]], [[Santee tribe|Santee]], [[Wichita (tribe)|Wichita]], and [[Sioux|Yankton]].{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}\n\nThe nomadic tribes of the Great Plains survived on [[hunting]], some of their major hunts centered on deer and buffalo. Some tribes are described as part of the 'Buffalo Culture' (sometimes called, for the [[American Bison]]). Although the Plains Indians hunted other animals, such as [[elk]] or [[Pronghorn|antelope]], bison was their primary game food source. Bison flesh, hide, and bones from [[Bison hunting]] provided the chief source of raw materials for items that Plains Indians made, including food, cups, decorations, crafting tools, knives, and clothing.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}\n\nThe tribes followed the bison's seasonal grazing and migration. The Plains Indians lived in [[teepees]] because they were easily disassembled and allowed the nomadic life of following game. When [[Spain|Spanish]] [[horse]]s were obtained, the Plains tribes rapidly integrated them into their daily lives. By the early 18th century, many tribes had fully adopted a [[horse culture]]. Before their adoption of guns, the Plains Indians hunted with [[spear]]s, [[bow (weapon)|bows]], and [[bows and arrows]], and various forms of [[Club (organization)|clubs]]. The use of horses by the Plains Indians made hunting (and warfare) much easier.<ref>{{cite book |last= Hamalainen |first= Pekka |title= The Comanche Empire |year= 2008 |publisher= Yale University Press |isbn= 978-0-300-12654-9 |pages= 37\u201338}}</ref>\n\nAmong the most powerful and dominant tribes were the [[Dakota people|Dakota]] or [[Sioux]], who occupied large amounts of territory in the Great Plains of the Midwest.

They established a public culture that emphasized the work ethic, the sanctity of private property, individual responsibility, faith in residential and social mobility, practicality, piety, public order and decorum, reverence for public education, activists, honest, and frugal government, town meeting democracy, and he believed that there was a public interest that transcends particular and stick ambitions. Regarding themselves as the elect and just in a world rife with sin, air, and corruption, they felt a strong moral obligation to define and enforce standards of community and personal behavior....This pietistic worldview was substantially shared by British, Scandinavian, Swiss, English-Canadian and Dutch Reformed immigrants, as well as by German Protestants and many of the Forty-Eighters.<ref>John Buenker, \"Wisconsin\" in {{cite book|last=James H.

These large groups, Buenker argues:\n\n<blockquote>Generally subscribed to the work ethic, a strong sense of community, and activist government, but were less committed to economic individualism and privatism and ferociously opposed to government supervision of the personal habits. Southern and eastern European immigrants generally leaned more toward the Germanic view of things, while modernization, industrialization, and urbanization modified nearly everyone's sense of individual economic responsibility and put a premium on organization, political involvement, and education.<ref>John Buenker, \"Wisconsin\"</ref><ref>Richard J.

The first and foremost was the [[Ohio River]], which flowed into the [[Mississippi River]]. Development of the region was halted until 1795 by [[Spain]]'s control of the southern part of the Mississippi and its refusal to allow the shipment of American crops down the river and into the [[Atlantic Ocean]].{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}\n\nThe second waterway is the network of routes within the Great Lakes. The opening of the [[Erie Canal]] in 1825 completed an all-water shipping route, more direct than the Mississippi, to [[New York (state)|New York]] and the seaport of [[New York City]]. In 1848, The [[Illinois and Michigan Canal]] breached the [[continental divide]] spanning the [[Chicago Portage]] and linking the waters of the Great Lakes with those of the [[Mississippi Valley]] and the [[Gulf of Mexico]]. Lakeport and river cities grew up to handle these new shipping routes. During the [[Industrial Revolution]], the lakes became a conduit for [[iron ore]] from the [[Mesabi Range]] of Minnesota to [[steel mill]]s in the [[Mid-Atlantic States]]. The [[Saint Lawrence Seaway]], completed in 1959, opened the Midwest to the Atlantic Ocean.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.encyclopedia.com/places/united-states-and-canada/canadian-physical-geography/saint-lawrence-seaway|title=Saint Lawrence Seaway|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nThe third waterway, the [[Missouri River]], extended water travel from the Mississippi almost to the Rocky Mountains.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}\n\n[[File:Efmo View from Fire Point.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|The [[Upper Mississippi River]] near [[Harpers Ferry, Iowa]]]]\nIn the 1870s and 1880s, the Mississippi River inspired two classic books\u2014''[[Life on the Mississippi]]'' and ''[[Adventures of Huckleberry Finn]]''\u2014written by native Missourian Samuel Clemens, who used the pseudonym [[Mark Twain]]. His stories became staples of Midwestern lore. Twain's hometown of [[Hannibal, Missouri]], is a tourist attraction offering a glimpse into the Midwest of his time.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}\n\nInland canals in Ohio and Indiana constituted another important waterway, which connected with Great Lakes and Ohio River traffic. The commodities that the Midwest funneled into the [[Erie Canal]] down the Ohio River contributed to the wealth of New York City, which overtook [[Boston]] and [[Philadelphia]].{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}\n\n==== Railroads and the automobile ====\nDuring the mid-19th century, the region got its first railroads, and the railroad junction in Chicago became the world's largest. During the century, Chicago became the nation's railroad center. By 1910, over 20 railroads operated passenger service out of six different downtown terminals. Even today, a century after [[Henry Ford]], six [[Class I railroad]]s meet in Chicago.{{sfnp|Condit|1973|pp=43-49, 58, 318-319}}<ref>{{Holland-Classic|pages = 66\u201391}}</ref>\n\nIn the period from 1890 to 1930, many Midwestern cities were connected by electric [[interurban]] railroads, similar to streetcars. The Midwest had more interurbans than any other region. In 1916, Ohio led all states with {{convert|2,798|mi|km}}, Indiana followed with {{convert|1,825|mi|km}}.

By 1900, [[Detroit, Michigan|Detroit]] was the world center of the auto industry, and soon practically every city within 200 miles was producing auto parts that fed into its giant factories.<ref>{{Cite journal |jstor = 3144703|title = The Automotive Industry: A Study in Industrial Location|journal = Land Economics|volume = 35|issue = 1|pages = 1\u201314|last1 = Hurley|first1 = Neil P.|year = 1959|doi = 10.2307/3144703}}</ref>\n\nIn 1903, Henry Ford founded the [[Ford Motor Company]]. Ford's manufacturing\u2014and those of automotive pioneers [[William C.

The regional southern boundary was the Ohio River, the border of freedom and slavery in American history and literature (see ''[[Uncle Tom's Cabin]]'' by [[Harriet Beecher Stowe]] and ''[[Beloved (novel)|Beloved]]'' by [[Toni Morrison]]).\n\nThe Midwest, particularly Ohio, provided the primary routes for the ''[[Underground Railroad]]'', whereby Midwesterners assisted slaves to freedom from their crossing of the Ohio River through their departure on [[Lake Erie]] to Canada. Created in the early 19th century, the Underground Railroad was at its height between 1850 and 1860. One estimate suggests that by 1850, 100,000 slaves had escaped via the Underground Railroad.<ref name=\"afroamhistory\">[http://afroamhistory.about.com/od/undergroundrailroad/a/undergroundrr.htm The Fugitive Slave Law] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090125175114/http://afroamhistory.about.com/od/undergroundrailroad/a/undergroundrr.htm |date=25 January 2009 }} African-American History, pp. 1\u20132. About.com</ref>\n\nThe Underground Railroad consisted of meeting points, secret routes, transportation, and safe houses and assistance provided by abolitionist sympathizers. Individuals were often organized in small, independent groups; this helped to maintain secrecy because individuals knew some connecting \"stations\" along the route, but knew few details of their immediate area. Escaped slaves would move north along the route from one way station to the next. Although the fugitives sometimes traveled on boat or train, they usually traveled on foot or by wagon.<ref>Bordewich, Fergus, 2005, p. 236</ref>\n\nThe region was shaped by the relative absence of slavery (except for Missouri), pioneer settlement, education in [[one-room school|one-room free public schools]], democratic notions brought by [[American Revolutionary War]] veterans, [[Protestant]] faiths and experimentation, and agricultural wealth transported on the Ohio River [[riverboat]]s, [[flatboat]]s, [[Barge|canal boats]], and [[rail transport|railroads]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}}\n\n==== Bleeding Kansas ====\n{{Main|Bleeding Kansas}}\n\nThe first violent conflicts leading up to the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] occurred between two neighboring Midwestern states, Kansas and Missouri, involving [[Abolitionism in the United States|anti-slavery]] [[Free-Stater (Kansas)|Free-Staters]] and pro-slavery \"[[Border Ruffian]]\" elements, that took place in the [[Kansas Territory]] and the western frontier towns of Missouri roughly between 1854 and 1858. At the heart of the conflict was the question of whether Kansas would enter the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] as a free state or slave state. As such, [[Bleeding Kansas]] was a [[proxy war]] between [[Northern United States|Northerners]] and [[Southern United States|Southerners]] over the issue of [[slavery in the United States|slavery]]. The term \"Bleeding Kansas\" was coined by [[Horace Greeley]] of the ''[[New York Tribune]]''; the events it encompasses directly presaged the Civil War.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}\n\n[[File:Bleeding Kansas Poster.jpg|thumb|upright|1855 [[Free-Stater (Kansas)|Free-State]] poster]]\nSetting in motion the events later known as \"Bleeding Kansas\" was the [[Kansas-Nebraska Act of 1854|Kansas-Nebraska Act]]. The Act created the territories of Kansas and Nebraska, opened new lands that would help settlement in them, repealed the [[Missouri Compromise of 1820|Missouri Compromise]], and allowed settlers in those territories to determine through [[Popular sovereignty in the United States|popular sovereignty]] whether to allow slavery within their boundaries. It was hoped the Act would ease relations between the North and the South, because the South could expand slavery to new territories, but the North still had the right to abolish slavery in its states. Instead, opponents denounced the law as a concession to the [[The Slave Power|slave power]] of the South.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}\n\nThe new [[History of the United States Republican Party|Republican Party]], born in the Midwest ([[Ripon, Wisconsin]], 1854) and created in opposition to the Act, aimed to stop the expansion of slavery, and soon emerged as the dominant force throughout the North.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.masslive.com/history/index.ssf/2011/05/springfields_375th_from_puritans_to_presidents.html|title=Springfield's 375th: From Puritans to presidents|website=Masslive.com|access-date=2017-07-16}}</ref>\n\nAn ostensibly [[democracy|democratic]] idea, popular sovereignty stated that the inhabitants of each territory or state should decide whether it would be a free or slave state; however, this resulted in immigration ''en masse'' to Kansas by activists from both sides. At one point, Kansas had two separate governments, each with its own constitution, although only one was federally recognized. On January 29, 1861, Kansas was admitted to the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] as a free state, less than three months before the [[Battle of Fort Sumter]] officially began the Civil War.<ref>Robert W. Johansson, ''Stephen A. Douglas '' (Oxford UP, 1973) pp&nbsp;374\u2013400</ref>\n\nThe calm in Kansas was shattered in May 1856 by two events that are often regarded as the opening shots of the Civil War. On May 21, the [[Free Soil Party|Free Soil]] town of [[Lawrence, Kansas|Lawrence]], Kansas, was sacked by an armed pro\u2010slavery force from Missouri. A few days later, the [[Sacking of Lawrence]] led [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionist]] [[John Brown (abolitionist)|John Brown]] and six of his followers to execute five men along the [[Pottawatomie massacre|Pottawatomie Creek]] in [[Franklin County, Kansas|Franklin County]], Kansas, in retaliation.<ref>[https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/aia/part4/4p2952.html Africans in America Resource Bank: People and Events, 1853\u20131861, online].

The [[United States Army|U.S. Army]] had two garrisons in Kansas, the First Cavalry Regiment at [[Fort Leavenworth]] and the [[2nd Stryker Cavalry Regiment (United States)|Second Dragoons]] and Sixth Infantry at [[Fort Riley]].<ref>[http://www.answers.com/topic/pottawatomie-massacre-1 Gale Encyclopedia of U.S. History: Pottawatomie Massacre].

A fragile peace followed, but violent outbreaks continued intermittently for several more years.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}\n\nNational reaction to the events in Kansas demonstrated how deeply divided the country had become. The Border Ruffians were widely applauded in the South, even though their actions had cost the lives of numerous people. In the North, the murders committed by Brown and his followers were ignored by most, and lauded by a few.<ref>[http://www.u-s-history.com/pages/h84.html United States History \u2013 Bleeding Kansas online]. Retrieved June 14, 2011.</ref>\n\nThe civil conflict in Kansas was a product of the political fight over slavery. Federal troops were not used to decide a political question, but they were used by successive territorial governors to pacify the territory so that the political question of slavery in Kansas could finally be decided by peaceful, legal, and political means.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}\n\n[[File:US Slave Free 1789-1861.gif|thumb|upright=1.6|An animation depicting when United States territories and states forbade or allowed slavery, 1789\u20131861]]\nThe election of [[Abraham Lincoln]] in November 1860 was the final trigger for [[secession]] by the Southern states.<ref>David Potter, ''The Impending Crisis'', p. 485.</ref> Efforts at compromise, including the \"[[Corwin Amendment]]\" and the ''[[Crittenden Compromise]]'', failed.

All of the Midwestern states but one, Missouri, banned slavery. Though most battles were fought in the South, skirmishes between Kansas and Missouri continued until culmination with the [[Lawrence Massacre]] on August 21, 1863. Also known as Quantrill's Raid, the massacre was a rebel guerrilla attack by [[Quantrill's Raiders]], led by William Clarke Quantrill, on pro-Union Lawrence, Kansas. Quantrill's band of 448 Missouri guerrillas raided and plundered Lawrence, killing more than 150 and burning all the business buildings and most of the dwellings.

In 1789, the [[Northwest Ordinance]] was enacted, creating the [[Northwest Territory]], which was bounded by the Great Lakes and the Ohio and Mississippi Rivers. Because the Northwest Territory lay between the East Coast and the then-far-West, the states carved out of it were called the ''Northwest''. In the early 19th century, anything west of the Mississippi River was considered the West. The first recorded use of the term ''Midwestern'' to refer to a region of the central U.S. occurred in 1886, ''Midwest'' appeared in 1894, and ''Midwesterner'' in 1916.<ref name=\"oed.com\">[[Oxford English Dictionary]] entries for ''Midwestern'', ''Midwest'', and ''Midwesterner'', http://www.oed.com/</ref>\n\nSome maintain that only the areas that made up the Northwest Territory can truly be called the Midwest, and that all other areas to the west should be properly labeled as part of the \"Great Plains\" region instead. But following the settlement of the western prairie, others considered the row of states from North Dakota to Kansas to be part of the Midwest as well.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.loc.gov/item/ihas.200197407 |title=Regional Song Sampler: The Midwest &#124; Library of Congress |website=Loc.gov |date= |accessdate=2017-07-16}}</ref>\n\nThe states of the \"old Northwest\" are now called the \"East North Central States\" by the United States Census Bureau, with the \"Great Lakes region\" being also a popular term. The states just west of the Mississippi River and the Great Plains states are called the \"West North Central States\" by the Census Bureau.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}} Some entities in the Midwest are still referred to as \"Northwest\" for historical reasons (for example, [[Northwestern University]] in Illinois).{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}\n\n== Economy ==\n=== Farming and agriculture ===\n[[File:Pastoral-barn.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|A pastoral [[farm]] scene near [[Traverse City, Michigan]], with a classic American red [[barn]]]]\n[[File:maytag.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.15|Central Iowa cornfield in June]]\n[[File:Standing wheat in Kansas.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.15|Standing wheat in Kansas, part of America's Breadbasket]]\n[[File:Soybean fields at Applethorpe Farm.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.15|[[Soybean]] fields at [[Applethorpe Farm]], north of [[Hallsville, Ohio|Hallsville]] in Ross County, Ohio]]\n{{Further|Corn Belt|Wheat production in the United States}}\n[[Agriculture]] is one of the biggest drivers of local economies in the Midwest, accounting for billions of dollars worth of exports and thousands of jobs.

In cooler regions, wheat was often the crop of choice when lands were newly settled, leading to a \"wheat frontier\" that moved westward over the course of years. Also very common in the antebellum Midwest was farming corn while raising [[Hog (swine)|hogs]], complementing each other especially since it was difficult to get grain to market before the canals and railroads. After the \"wheat frontier\" had passed through an area, more diversified farms including [[dairy cattle|dairy]] and [[beef cattle]] generally took its place.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}\n\nThe very dense soil of the Midwest plagued the first settlers who were using wooden [[Plough|plows]], which were more suitable for loose forest soil. On the prairie, the plows bounced around and the soil stuck to them. This problem was solved in 1837 by an Illinois [[blacksmith]] named [[John Deere (inventor)|John Deere]] who developed a [[steel]] moldboard plow that was stronger and cut the roots, making the fertile soils of the prairie ready for farming.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}\n\nThe tallgrass prairie has been converted into one of the most intensive crop producing areas in [[North America]].

Theodore Roosevelt's [[Progressive Party (United States, 1912)|1912 Progressive Party]] had the best showing in this region; carrying the states of Michigan, Minnesota, and South Dakota. In 1924, La Follette, Sr.'s [[Progressive Party (United States, 1924\u201334)|1924 Progressive Party]] did well in the region, but only carried his home base of Wisconsin.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}\n\nThe Midwest\u2014especially the areas west of Chicago\u2014has always been a stronghold of [[United States non-interventionism|isolationism]], a belief that America should not involve itself in foreign entanglements. This position was largely based on the many [[German American]] and [[Swedish-American]] communities. Isolationist leaders included the La Follettes, Ohio's [[Robert A. Taft]], and [[Robert R. McCormick|Colonel Robert McCormick]], publisher of the ''Chicago Tribune''.<ref>{{cite journal |first=Ralph H. |last=Smuckler |title=The Region of Isolationism |journal=[[American Political Science Review]] |year=1953 |volume=47 |issue=2 |pages=386\u2013401 |jstor=1952029 |doi=10.2307/1952029 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |first=John N. |last=Schacht |title=Three Faces of Midwestern Isolationism: Gerald P.

Upper Midwestern states of Illinois, Michigan, Minnesota, and Wisconsin reliably voted Democratic in every presidential election from 1992 to 2012. The Great Plains states of North Dakota, South Dakota, Nebraska, and Kansas have voted for the Republican candidate in every presidential election since 1940, except for Democrat [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] in [[1964 United States presidential election|1964]]. Indiana is usually considered a Republican stronghold, voting that party's presidential candidate in every election since 1940, except for Johnson in 1964 and [[Barack Obama]] in 2008.<ref>{{cite web |title=Election Statistics, 1920 to Present |url=http://history.house.gov/Institution/Election-Statistics/Election-Statistics/ |website=History, Art & Archives: US House of Representatives |accessdate=30 July 2018}}</ref>\n\nAs a result of the 2016 elections, Republicans controlled the governors' office in all Midwestern states except Minnesota and the Republicans also controlled every partisan state legislature in the Midwest except [[Illinois state legislature|Illinois]]. The unicameral [[Nebraska Legislature]] is officially nonpartisan.<ref>{{cite web |title=Unicam Focus |url=https://nebraskalegislature.gov/education/lesson3.php |website=Nebraska Legislature |accessdate=30 July 2018}}</ref> In 2018, however, the Democrats made a significant comeback by flipping the gubernatorial elections in [[Illinois gubernatorial election, 2018|Illinois]], [[Kansas gubernatorial election, 2018|Kansas]], [[Michigan gubernatorial election, 2018|Michigan]] and [[Wisconsin gubernatorial election, 2018|Wisconsin]]. The Democrats also flipped the [[Minnesota House of Representatives]] after losing control in [[United States elections, 2014|2014]].\n\nThe state government of Illinois currently has a Democratic Governor [[J. B. Pritzker|J.B. Pritzker]] and [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] super majorities in the state house and state senate. The state currently has two Democratic senators, and a 13\u20135 Democratic majority U.S. House of Representatives delegation.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}\n\nMany analysts{{who|date=May 2016}} consider Iowa the most evenly divided state in the country, but it has leaned Democratic for at least the past fifteen years.{{when|date=May 2016}} Iowa had a Democratic governor from 1999 until [[Terry Branstad]] was re-elected in the mid-term elections in 2010, and has had both one Democratic and one Republican senator since the early 1980s until the 2014 election when Republican [[Joni Ernst]] defeated Democrat [[Bruce Braley]] in a tightly contested race.<ref>{{cite web|title = Dave Leip's Atlas of U.S. Presidential Elections|url = http://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS/|website = uselectionatlas.org|access-date = 2016-02-15|first = David|last = Leip}}</ref> As for Iowa's House delegation, Democrats currently hold a 3 to 1 seat majority as a result of the 2018 elections. Between 1992 and 2012, Iowa also voted for the Democratic presidential candidate in all elections except 2004, but in 2016 the state went to the Republicans by 10 percentage points. As a result of the 2016 elections, Republicans hold a majority in the [[Iowa House of Representatives]] and the [[Iowa Senate]].{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}\n\nMinnesota voters have not voted for a Republican candidate for president since 1972, longer than any other state. Minnesota was the only U.S. state (along with Washington, D.C.) to vote for its native son [[Walter Mondale]] over [[Ronald Reagan]] in 1984. However, the recent{{when|date=May 2016}} Democratic victories have often been fairly narrow, such as the 2016 Presidential Election. Minnesota also elected and re-elected a Republican governor ([[Tim Pawlenty]]), as well as supported some of the strongest [[Concealed carry in the United States|gun concealment]] laws in the nation.\n\nConsistently, Ohio is a battleground state in presidential elections. No Republican has won the office without winning Ohio. This trend has contributed to Ohio's reputation as a quintessential swing state. At the state level, however, Republicans are currently dominant. With the exception of one justice of the [[Supreme Court of Ohio]], all political offices open to statewide election are held by Republicans. Republicans have a majority in the [[Ohio House of Representatives]] and a supermajority in the [[Ohio Senate]]. At the federal level, Ohio currently has one Democratic and one Republican U.S. Senator.{{when|date=May 2016}} As a result of the 2012 elections, 12 of Ohio's 16 members of the [[U.S. House of Representatives]] are Republicans.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}\n\nThe Great Plains states of North Dakota, South Dakota, Nebraska, and Kansas have been strongholds for the Republicans for many decades. These four states have gone for the Republican candidate in every presidential election since 1940, except for [[Lyndon B. Johnson]]'s landslide over [[Barry Goldwater]] in [[1964 United States presidential election|1964]]. Although North Dakota and South Dakota have often elected Democrats to Congress, after the 2012 election both states' congressional delegations are majority Republican. Nebraska has elected Democrats to the Senate and as governor in recent years, but both of its senators are Republican.{{when|date=May 2016}} Kansas has elected a majority of Democrats as governor since 1956, but has not elected a Democratic senator since 1932. Both of Kansas's U.S. Senators and all four of its U.S. House members are Republican.{{when|date=May 2016}}\n\nMissouri was historically considered a \"bellwether state\", having voted for the winner in every presidential election since 1904, with three exceptions: in [[1956 United States presidential election|1956]] for Democrat [[Adlai Stevenson II]]; in [[2008 United States presidential election|2008]] for Republican [[John McCain]]; and in [[2012 United States presidential election|2012]] for Republican [[Mitt Romney]]. Missouri's House delegation has generally been evenly divided, with the Democrats holding sway in the large cities at the opposite ends of the state, Kansas City and St. Louis (although the Kansas City suburbs are now trending Republican), and the Republicans controlling the rest of the state, save for a pocket of Democratic strength in [[Columbia, Missouri|Columbia]], home to the [[University of Missouri]]. However, as a result of the 2012 elections, Republicans now have a 6\u20132 majority in the state's House delegation, with African-American Democrats representing the major cities. Missouri's Senate seats were mostly controlled by Democrats until the latter part of the 20th century, but the Republicans have held one or both Senate seats continuously since 1976.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}\n\nAll Midwestern states use primary election to select delegates for both the Democratic and Republican national conventions, except for Iowa. The [[Iowa caucuses]] in early January of leap years are the first votes in the [[United States presidential election|presidential nominating process]] for both major parties, and attract enormous media attention.<ref>David P.

Tolbert]], and Todd Donovan, ''Why Iowa?: how caucuses and sequential elections improve the presidential nominating process'' (2011)</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Cuisine of the Midwestern United States]]\n* [[Territories of the United States on stamps]]\n\n=== Other regions of the United States ===\n* [[Southeastern United States]]\n* [[South Central United States]]\n* [[Western United States]]\n* [[Northeastern United States]]\n\n== Bibliography ==\n* Frederick; John T., ed.

{"title_page": "Peter Greig-Smith", "text_new": "'''Peter Greig-Smith''' (b. 1922\u2013d. 2003) was a British plant ecologist, founder of the discipline of quantitative ecology in the United Kingdom. He had a deep influence across the world on vegetation studies and plant ecology, mostly from his book ''Quantitative Plant Ecology'', first published in 1957 and a must-read for multiple generations of young ecologists.[[File:Peter Greig-Smith -1988.tif|thumb|Jubilee Symposium for the 75th anniversary of the British Ecological Society at University College, London held on April 12-13 1988. Past Presidents gathered for a team photograph: Back row, left to right: A.D. Bradshaw, R.J. Berry, '''Peter Greig-Smith''', A. Macfadyen, C.H. Gimingham, G. Dunnet, L.R.Taylor. Front row from left: C.H. Evans; P.R. Richards, J. Harley, R. Southwood.]]\nIn 1952, Greig-Smith was hired by the University College of North Wales at Bangor, Wales (now Bangor University), where he spent the rest of his academic career. His book ''Quantitative Plant Ecology'' spread the ideas of rigorous, quantitative ecological methods among the world\u2019s research community, and made his lab at Bangor a magnet for plant biologists with an interest in mathematical and statistical methods. A stout supporter of Bangor\u2019s graduate program in Ecology, he recruited and advised many students and research collaborators from all continents.\n\nA prominent member of the British Ecological Society, he was first elected to Council in 1957, and in 1961 he became Honorary Secretary. He held this post until 1964, when he resigned to become editor of the ''Journal of Ecology'', the society\u2019s scientific publication. He remained as editor until 1968. In 1977 he was elected Vice President of the Society, and served as President in 1978 and 1979.\n\n== Mathematics in Ecology ==\nThe postwar period, and especially the 1950s, saw a rising quest for a truly quantitative approach to community ecology. Community description to that point had been predominantly qualitative and had been based mostly on attempts to extend the principles of Linnaean taxonomy into the classification of plant communities. Four innovative ecologists directed their efforts to bring the principles of statistics and mathematics to vegetation analysis: [[John Thomas Curtis|John T. Curtis]] and [[Robert Whittaker|Robert H. Whittaker]] in the United States, and [[David Goodall (botanist)|David W. Goodall]] and Peter Greig-Smith in the United Kingdom. J. T. Curtis, in collaboration with [[J. Roger Bray]], developed the first method of community ordination and also developed the idea of ecological dissimilarity or \u201cecological distance measure\u201d that later opened the way to the concept of niche overlap. Robert H. Whittaker was the proponent of gradient analysis to address fundamental questions of how plants use space and resources. He provided foundational elements for a quantitative theory of biodiversity and was most active in the areas of plant community analysis, succession, and productivity. David Goodall worked as a professor of agricultural botany at the University of Reading, where he developed a series of studies on plant sampling, distribution, and multivariate analysis. In 1956, however, Goodall immigrated to Australia, where he led a sixty-year-long and extremely fruitful career, becoming one of the world\u2019s most renowned ecologists. Greig-Smith, eight years younger than Goodall, became the champion of the quantitative approach in plant ecology in Britain.\n\n== Early Work ==\n[[File:AS Watt.tif|thumb|Alexander S. Watt, Greig-Smith's mentor and one of the most influential British ecologists of the 20th Century.]]\nGreig-Smith went to school in Birmingham, United Kingdom, before going to Downing College, Cambridge, where he was inspired by the teachings of [[Alexander Watt|Alexander S. Watt]], the first British botanist to seriously study the phenomenon of pattern and scaling in plant communities from a quantitative perspective. Watt\u2019s influence can be seen in Greig-Smith\u2019s obituaries of him<ref>Greig-Smith, Peter. 1982. A. S. Watt, F.R.S.: A biographical note. In ''The plant community as a working mechanism: Produced as a tribute to A. S. Watt''. Edited by E. I. Newman, 9\u201310. Special Publication of the British Ecological Society 1. Oxford: Blackwell Scientific.</ref><ref>Greig-Smith, Peter. 1990. Alexander Stuart Watt: 21 June 1892\u20132 March 1985. ''Biographical Memoirs of Fellows of the Royal Society'' 35):404\u2013423.</ref>. The ''Biographical Memoirs'' of the Royal Society show that Watt, in turn, had studied at Cambridge under the mentorship of the ecologist Sir [[Arthur Tansley|Arthur G. Tansley]] (1871\u20131955), a direct academic descendant of [[Thomas Henry Huxley]] and [[Charles Darwin]] (Tansley had studied with Francis W. Oliver [1864\u20131951] at the University College, London, who in turn had been mentored by Sir E. Ray Lankester [1847\u20131929] at Cambridge, a student of George Rolleston [1829\u20131881] at Oxford, who had been in turn mentored by Thomas Henry Huxley \u2014\"Darwin's bulldog\"\u2014 in London). In 1944, after graduating from Cambridge, Greig-Smith went to the Imperial College\u2019s Field Station at Slough, where he studied the effect of herbicides on oilseed crops under the direction of the Geoffrey E. Blackman, founder of the science of selective herbicides in Britain. The Slough herbicide tests, part of Britain\u2019s war effort, involved the planting of large-scale experiments with random block and nested designs, an experience that played a central role in nurturing Greig-Smith\u2019s interest in statistical methods and experimental plot designs. In 1945 he moved to the University of Manchester as lecturer in botany. At Manchester, he cultivated a wide array of research interests, ranging from the taxonomy of liverworts and stinging nettles, the causes of spatial pattern in dune plants, the quantitative morphology and tussock formation of ''Ammophila arenaria'' (a dune grass), and the biogeographic distribution of liverworts to understand the fate of vegetation in the British Isles during the last glaciation.\n\n===Dune Ecology===\nGreig-Smith\u2019s first published paper dealt with the varying growth forms of the dune grass ''Ammophila arenaria'' in calcareous sand dunes on the Isle of Harris, Outer Hebrides<ref>Greig-Smith, Peter, Alan R. Gemmell, and Charles H. Gimingham. 1947. Tussock formation in ''Ammophila arenaria'' (L) Link. ''New Phytologist'' 46(2): 262\u2013268.</ref>. This paper was followed two years later by a detailed description of the dune\u2019s plants<ref>Gimingham, Charles H., Alan R. Gemmell, and Peter Greig-Smith. 1949. The vegetation of a sand-dune system in the Outer Hebrides. ''Transactions and Proceedings of the Botanical Society of Edinburgh'' 35(1): 82\u201396.</ref>, using quantitative methods to describe the plant community. These early papers already mark his interest for quantification of natural phenomena. In this morphometric analysis of ''Ammophila arenaria'', for example, Greig-Smith measured in detail the internode length of the plant\u2019s rhizomes and noted the species\u2019 tendency to form tussock-like clumps in older dunes and longer, exploratory rhizomes in unstable, younger dunes.\n\n===Taxonomy and Biogeography===\nSome of Greig-Smith\u2019s early work was devoted to taxonomy and biogeography, trying to bring a quantitative approach to these branches of the biological sciences. Much of his taxonomic work was devoted to the evolutionary taxonomy and ecology of pounceworts (Lejeunaceae, a family of liverworts)<ref>Greig-Smith, Peter. 1948b. ''Potamolejeunea Holtii'' (spruce) nov.comb. ''Transactions of the British Bryological Society'' 1(2): 108\u2013109.</ref><ref>Greig-Smith, Peter. 1948c.

''Microlejeunea diversiloba'' (spr.) K.M. ''Transactions of the British Bryological Society'' 2(2): 285\u2013288.</ref>. In 1950 he published a synthesis paper on the taxonomy and biogeography of liverworts<ref>Greig-Smith, Peter. 1954. Notes on Lejeuneaceae: II. A quantitative assessment of criteria used in distinguishing some British species of ''Lejeunea''. ''Transactions of the British Bryological Society'' 2(3): 458\u2013469.</ref>, as an early attempt to shed some light on the question of the effects of Quaternary glaciations on the history of the British flora<ref>Greig-Smith, Peter. 1950. Evidence from hepatics on the history of the British flora. ''Journal of Ecology'' 38(2): 320\u2013344.</ref>. He tried to evaluate how many of the extant British liverworts had survived Pleistocene glaciations ''in situ'' and how many, in contrast, were postglacial migrants from southern latitudes. Almost two decades before the theory of Pleistocene refugia was proposed by [[J\u00fcrgen Haffer]] for the Amazon<ref>Haffer, J\u00fcrgen. 1969. Speciation in Amazonian forest birds. ''Science'' 165(3889): 131\u2013137.</ref>, Greig-Smith was using plant distributions to understand the vegetation changes induced by Pleistocene glaciations, and setting a new direction for Quaternary Paleobotany that few could value in its full significance at that time. As part of the Flora of the British Isles series published in the ''Journal of Ecology'', Greig-Smith drafted a synthesis paper of the natural history of the nettles of the United Kingdom, and a detailed analysis of the communities where they prosper<ref>Greig-Smith, Peter. 1948a. Biological flora of the British Isles: ''Urtica'' L. ''Journal of Ecology'' 36(2): 339\u2013355.</ref>.\n\n===Tropical Ecology===\nIn 1940, Paul Richards, Sir Arthur Tansley, and Alexander Watt published a seminal paper<ref>Richards, Paul W., Arthur G. Tansley and Alexander S. Watt. 1940. The recording of structure, life form and flora of tropical forest communities as a basis for their classification. ''Journal of Ecology'' 28(1): 224\u2013239.</ref> on the classification of tropical rainforests revealing a fascination with the complexity of tropical vegetation that was halted by the war, but that Watt passed down later to Greig-Smith, his student at Cambridge. In July 1948 Greig-Smith received a research grant from the Colonial Office to visit the island of Trinidad to study tropical rainforests. Encouraged by E. Ashby, an early pioneer of quantitative methods who was then professor of botany at Manchester, he left the university for six months to study secondary succession in Trinidad, in collaboration with colleagues of the Imperial College of Tropical Agriculture on the island.\n\nLike Darwin in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest, he was gripped by the complexity of tropical forests. In order to try to unravel and explain this complexity, he developed novel statistical methods to test hypotheses on the association between species and the spatial pattern of saplings and adult trees in the field. An avid naturalist, he also developed in Trinidad a passion for orchids, which led him later to start cultivating his own orchid collection in the United Kingdom. After his visit to Trinidad in 1948, Greig-Smith drafted two detailed papers on secondary tropical forests<ref>Greig-Smith, Peter. 1952a. Ecological observations on degraded and secondary forest in Trinidad, British West Indies: 1. General features of the vegetation. ''Journal of Ecology'' 40(2): 283\u2013330.</ref><ref>Greig-Smith, Peter. 1952b. Ecological observations on degraded and secondary forest in Trinidad, British West Indies: 2. Structure of the communities. ''Journal of Ecology'' 40(2): 316\u2013330.</ref>. The first study included a number of techniques that at that time were novel in vegetation analysis, such as the species-area plots developed by Ronald A. Fisher and Henry Gleason, size-specific survivorship, and quantitative floristic tables. In the second Trinidad paper, he also used nested analyses of variance (ANOVAs), comparisons with the Poisson distribution, and variance-to-mean ratios to test and understand spatial patterns in the trees of the secondary forest. He concluded his paper questioning Frederic Clement\u2019s concept of plant communities as complex supra-organisms, and in support of Gleason\u2019s individualistic model of plant communities.\n\n== Bangor ==\n[[File:Bangor greenhouses.jpg|thumb|Greenhouses of the School of Plant Biology at Bangor in the mid-1970s. Photo courtesy of Bangor University.]]\nIn 1952, Greig-Smith moved to the [[Bangor University|University College of North Wales at Bangor]], where he spent the rest of his career. After the publication of his book ''Quantitative Plant Ecology'' in 1957, which rapidly spread among the research community and became a success, Bangor became a magnet for plant biologists with an interest in quantitative methods. Greig-Smith was keenly interested in the MSc program in Ecology that Professor Paul W. Richards had developed at Bangor, and advised many Masters' students from where he recruited many doctoral students and research collaborators. Most of the students, postdocs, and research visitors in his lab later became outstanding ecologists in their own right, such as Georg Grabherr (University of Vienna), Kenneth A. Kershaw (who moved to McMaster University, Hamilton, Ontario), Michael P. Austin (a postdoc at Bangor, studying tropical forests, who later moved to CSIRO at Canberra, Australia), Robert P. McIntosh (University of Notre Dame, South Bend, Indiana), L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Orl\u00f3ci (also a postdoc, later moved to the University of Western Ontario in London, Canada), Timothy F. H. Allen (University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison), Mark O. Hill (Natural Environment Research Council, Swindon, UK), Michael J. Liddle (Monks Wood Experimental Station, Cambridgeshire, UK; later at Griffith University, Queensland, Australia), Michael D. Swaine (University of Aberdeen, Scotland), M. A. Pemadasa (University of Sri Lanka), David J. Gibson (Southern Illinois University, Carbondale), and Tewolde B. G. Egziabher (Environmental Protection Authority, Ethiopia), among many others. The place was a haven for academic exchange: Laszlo Orl\u00f3ci recalls in his biographical memories<ref>Orl\u00f3ci, L\u00e1szl\u00f3. 2019. ''Looking back: A life of statistical ecology''. 3<sup>rd</sup> ed. Scada Publishing, Canada. Online Edition: <nowiki>https://www.amazon.com/dp/1796403148</nowiki> (edited transcript of Orl\u00f3ci\u2019s talk at a symposium in his honor held at the University of Guelph, Guelph, Otario, Canada, on 27 June 2012. Also available at: <nowiki>https://www.researchgate.net/publication/334432585</nowiki>)</ref> that during 1964 alone, Greig-Smith\u2019s lab at Bangor received the visit of [[Robert R. Sokal|Robert Sokal]] and [[Peter Sneath]], founders of the discipline of numerical taxonomy, and [[David Goodall (botanist)|David Goodall]], William T. Williams, and Mike Dale, who were creating initial content for a solid school of statistical ecology in Australia.\n\n=== Pattern and Scaling in Ecological Sciences ===\n[[File:Scaling design.tif|thumb|In the early 1950s, Greig-Smith started using graphs in which he plotted the variance in plant density versus the size of the sample plot, to find peaks that could identify clump size in aggregated distributions. In doing so, he realized that ecosystem properties are scale-dependent: a species can have a regular distribution at a given scale, but be highly clumped at another.]]\nGreig-Smith was fascinated by the phenomenon of plant spatial pattern, defined by the question: why are some plants regularly spaced while others are densely clumped? He realized that plants could be clumped at a certain scale, but that those clumps, in turn, could be randomly, or even regularly distributed at larger scales. Patterns and processes in ecology, he concluded, can have different behaviors at different scale. Strongly influenced by his early experience in agricultural experiments using random blocks and nested designs, he sought to answer this question by using, as his core tool, a series of quadrats nested within each other at different scales. Much of Greig-Smith\u2019s published work was devoted to advancing the theory and methods of plant pattern, using his nested-quadrat approach as a basic tool. His fundamental idea that the perceived properties of ecological phenomena are scale-dependent set the foundations for the development of a theory of scaling in ecology, a central concept in modern climate change and global sustainability studies.\n\n==== Dunes as Model Ecosystems ====\nOne of Greig-Smith\u2019s early research papers, Gemmell, et al.

After this initial study, the spatial pattern of dunes and grasslands became a lifelong interest in his ecological research, published in a number of papers with collaborators and students<ref>Gemmell, Alan R., Peter Greig-Smith, and Charles H.

One of Greig-Smith\u2019s students, Andrew Morton, continued Greig-Smith\u2019s pattern analysis studies in the dunes at Newborough Warren in Anglesey, Wales, near Bangor.\n\n====Pattern in Tropical Ecosystems====\nBelow only the study of coastal dunes, Greig-Smith\u2019s interests were strongly focused on tropical ecosystems. After his visit to Trinidad as a young researcher, he developed an interest for African savannas, on the possibility of using his methodology for pattern analysis to understand the importance of intraspecific competition in tropical, strongly rainfall-seasonal ecosystems<ref>Greig-Smith, Peter, and Michael J.

The analysis of pattern in vegetation: A comment on a paper by D. W. Goodall. ''Journal of Ecology'' 51(1): 223\u2013229.</ref>, he showed the importance of scaling in the measurement of plant spatial pattern. He understood that researchers sampling the same vegetation with quadrats of different size could reach diametrically opposed conclusions: a researcher using small quadrats would find that his quadrats harbor either clumps or no plants at all, and would conclude that the species pattern in space follows a clumped distribution. Similarly, a researcher using large quadrats would find a similar number of clumps in each quadrat and would conclude that the species distribution is markedly regular. In reality, both would be right because a species can have a strongly clumped distribution at a certain scale and a regular distribution at another. As president of the British Ecological Society, he wrote an address in 1979<ref>Greig-Smith, Peter. 1979. Pattern in vegetation. ''Journal of Ecology'' 67(3): 755\u2013779.</ref>, in which he summarized his ideas on the importance of scaling in ecological spatial pattern. Some of his students took his ideas and pursued them further: Mark Hill developed a rigorous mathematical theory for the analysis of pattern at a community level<ref>Hill, M. O. 1973. The intensity of spatial pattern in plant communities. ''Journal of Ecology'' 61(1): 225\u2013235.</ref>, while Kenneth Kershaw, after publishing in co-authorship with Greig-Smith, continued exploring for years the drivers of pattern at different scales.\n\n====Scaling in Modern Ecology====\nThe fundamental concept that ecological phenomena could have different behaviors when measured at different scales became really important for understanding large-scale phenomena in the biosphere. The Theory of Scaling became a mainstream concept in ecological research in the late 1980s and 1990s, with the publication of two now-classic papers: Wiens 1989<ref>Wiens, John A. 1989. Spatial scaling in ecology. ''Functional Ecology'' 3(4): 385\u2013397.</ref> and [[Simon A. Levin|Simon Levin]] 1992<ref>Levin, Simon A. 1992. The problem of pattern and scale in ecology: The Robert H. McArthur Award Lecture. ''Ecology'' 73(6): 1943\u20131967.</ref>. Greig-Smith, however, had figured out the main concepts four decades before, and both Wiens and Levin recognized him as a scientific pioneer.\n\n=== Multivariate Methods: Classification and Ordination in Ecology ===\nGreig-Smith was among the first ecologists to understand that multivariate methods were destined to become important tools in quantitative plant ecology. His inclusion of multivariate [[Cluster analysis|classification]] and [[Principal component analysis|ordination]] in his book opened the door for the explosion of analytical approaches and methodological discussions that surged in the 1970s and 1980s. As with pattern analysis, Greig-Smith was ahead of his time: although the potential of multivariate methods\u2014based on matrix algebra\u2014was already recognized in the 1950s, mostly as a result of a growing need for more-rigorous methods in ecology, performing an analysis of a modestly sized floristic matrix of, say, fifty sites and one hundred species was a complicated and enormously time-consuming task. The generalized access to electronic computers, which began in the 1960s, opened the doors for the widespread use of these methods; Bangor\u2019s first computer became available in 1964. Greig-Smith saw in multivariate methods an opportunity to analyze and understand the complex floristic composition of tropical forests, which had fascinated him since his visit to Trinidad in 1948. In 1963 he applied for a grant to investigate the use of quantitative methods to establish whether the highly diverse tropical rainforests showed any organized pattern, particularly in relation to environment, an open question at the time. With these funds, in 1964 he appointed Michael Austin as a postdoctoral research assistant to the project. Three seminal papers were published as a result of their collaboration, highlighting the potential of multivariate methods to analyze floristic patterns in complex, multispecies communities<ref>Greig-Smith, Peter, Michael P. Austin, and Timothy C. Whitmore. 1967. The application of quantitative methods to vegetation survey: I. Association-analysis and principal component ordination of rain forest. ''Journal of Ecology'' 55(2): 483\u2013503.</ref><ref>Austin, Michael P., and Peter Greig-Smith. 1968. The application of quantitative methods to vegetation survey: II.

The application of quantitative methods to vegetation survey: III. A re-examination of rain forest data from Brunei. ''Journal of Ecology'' 60(2): 305\u2013324.</ref>. The power of his approach, merging multivariate descriptive methods with experimental hypothesis testing, is especially noticeable in the work of some of his students like Mike Austin (cited previously), Exequiel Ezcurra<ref>Ezcurra, E. 1987. A comparison of Reciprocal Averaging and Non-Centred Principal Component Analysis. ''Vegetatio'' 71(1): 41\u201348.</ref>, and F.B. Goldsmith<ref>Goldsmith, F. B. 1973a.

The vegetation of exposed sea cliffs at South Stack, Anglesey: II. Experimental studies. ''Journal of Ecology'' 61(3): 819\u2013829.</ref>, among others. Mike Austin later moved to Australia and became one of the country\u2019s leading ecologists.\n\n==== Multivariate Methods as Hypothesis-Generating Procedures ====\nHaving laid the foundations of the discipline of multivariate methods, as a committed naturalist and field biologist Greig-Smith never took much interest in abstruse theoretical discussions, always expressing his concern about the risk of becoming too engaged with theoretical refinements of methodology and repeatedly stating his belief that numerical methods are worth developing only if they are to be used on real data in attempts to answer real questions with relevance in the field. The ultimate evidence, for him, was not in the computer output but in the field. In a synthesis paper published in 1980, he insisted that multivariate methods are simply hypothesis-generating procedures, and counseled students to do experimental tests addressing the insights from the classification and ordination analyses rather than taking the results of their analyses as an unchallengeable truth<ref>Greig-Smith, Peter. 1980. The development of numerical classification and ordination. ''Vegetatio'' 42(1\u20133): 1\u20139.</ref>.\n\n==== Novel Approaches to Multivariate Analysis ====\nGreig-Smith\u2019s later papers on multivariate methods, with Mike Swaine<ref>Swaine, Michael D., and Peter Greig-Smith. 1980. An application of principal components analysis to vegetation change in permanent plots. ''Journal of Ecology'' 68(1): 33\u201341.</ref> and Carlos Monta\u00f1a<ref>Monta\u00f1a, Carlos, and Peter Greig-Smith. 1990. Correspondence analysis of species by environmental variable matrices. ''Journal of Vegetation Science'' 1(4): 453\u2013460.</ref>, were devoted to exploring new and innovative applications for multivariate analysis, including the analysis of time-series data and the exploration of the niche preference of species within a community. In the first two decades of the 21st Century, with the advent of powerful computers and large datasets from molecular genetics studies, the methods of numerical classification and eigenvector ordination, promoted by Greig-Smith half a century earlier, exploded in their use to become indispensable tools in the new molecular approaches to taxonomy, genomics, phylogeography, and anthropolgy.\n\n===''Quantitative Plant Ecology'' (book) ===\nGreig-Smith\u2019s most influential work was his book ''Quantitative Plant Ecology'', used by generations of students and young researchers around the world. The book, first published in 1957, enjoyed two subsequent editions in 1964 and 1982<ref>Greig-Smith, Peter. 1957. ''Quantitative plant ecology''. London: Butterworths.</ref><ref>Greig-Smith, Peter. 1964. ''Quantitative plant ecology''. 2d ed. London: Butterworths.</ref><ref>Greig-Smith, Peter. 1982. ''Quantitative plant ecology''. 3d ed. Studies in Ecology 9. Berkeley: Univ. of California Press.</ref>.\n\nThe success of Greig-Smith\u2019s book triggered the publication of many other similar books, many of them by former Greig-Smith collaborators (such as Kershaw 1964<ref>Kershaw, Kenneth A. 1964. ''Quantitative and dynamic ecology''. New York: American Elsevier.</ref> and Orl\u00f3ci 1975<ref>Orl\u00f3ci, L\u00e1szl\u00f3. 1975. ''Multivariate analysis in vegetation research''. The Hague: W. Junk.</ref>), and nurtured an explosion of concepts and ideas around the quantitative treatment of ecological data, many of which arose in Canada (such as [[E. C. Pielou|Pielou]] 1969<ref>Pielou, Evelyn C. 1969. ''Introduction to Mathematical Ecology''. New York: Wiley-Interscience.</ref>) and Australia (such as Williams 1976<ref>Williams, William T., ed. 1976. ''Pattern analysis in agricultural science''. New York: Elsevier Scientific.</ref>).\n\n=== Holism and Reductionism in Ecology ===\nIn the 1950s and 1960s, at the time when the School of Plant Biology at Bangor consolidated as a global magnet for plant ecologists, an active scientific debate, excellently synthesized in Barbour (1996)<ref>Barbour, Michael G. 1996. American ecology and American culture in the 1950s: Who led whom? ''Bulletin of the Ecological Society of America'' 77(1): 44\u201351.</ref>, was taking place worldwide on the role of holism and reductionism as the main tools to understand ecological phenomena. In Britain, this debate centered mostly on the use of descriptive methods or the quest to understand patterns in nature, as opposed to the use of experimental methods or the search for ecological processes. In Bangor, in particular, the most vocal proponent of an experimental and reductionist approach to ecological research was [[John L. Harper]], who often criticized quantitative vegetation scientists on their descriptive, rather than experimental, approach to research. Roy Turkington<ref>Turkington, Roy. 2009. Obituary: Professor John L. Harper FRS CBE (1925\u20132009). ''Journal of Ecology'' 97(5): 835\u2013837.</ref> recalls that Harper strongly favored the power of simple, direct experiments and distrusted complex multivariate methods, often arguing that ordination methods were \u201ca formalized description of consequences.\u201d \u201cNowhere is this holism more apparent than in the way ecology is taught in many schools and universities with its emphasis on complex systems and the ways in which they can be described,\u201d wrote Harper in \u201cAfter Description\u201d<ref>Harper, John L. 1982. After description. In ''The plant community as a working mechanism: Produced as a tribute to A. S. Watt''. Edited by E. I. Newman, 11\u201325. Special Publication of the British Ecological Society 1. Oxford: Blackwell Scientific Publications.</ref>, and he immediately added: \u201cThere is probably no other science in which students are taught by being dropped into the deep end of complexity.\u201d The contrast between experimental ecology in simplified systems, with only one or a few species, against large-scale pattern-seeking methods led Peter Greig-Smith and John Harper into frequent discussions in the form of good-humored debates following departmental seminars in Bangor, which, as amusingly evoked in Hill (2003)<ref>Hill, Mark O. 2003. Peter Greig-Smith (1922\u20132003). ''Bulletin of the British Ecological Society'' 34(4): 10\u201311.</ref> and Matlack (2009)<ref>Matlack, Glenn R., ed. 2009. ''Memories of John L. Harper: A remembrance by his friends, students, and colleagues''. 2d ed. Bangor, Wales: SPB. Available online at <nowiki>http://people.virginia.edu/~ja8n/Publications/2011</nowiki> Memories of John L Harper.pdf</ref>, were conducted amid legendary clouds of pipe smoke for the benefit of the students, who could see firsthand how academic arguments conducted both with rigor and humor can be very stimulating and deeply entertaining. \n\nGreig-Smith, however, was not really a holist. From his very first papers on the tropical forests of Trinidad, he embraced Henry Gleason\u2019s \u201cindividualistic\u201d model of plant communities. [[Timothy F. H. Allen|Tim Allen]], a Greig-Smith student in the 1960s, recalls that while in the 1980s \u201cthe use of descriptive multivariate methods degenerated into a ritual that community ecologists were expected to perform\u201d<ref>Allen, Timothy F. H., Amanda J. Zellmer, and C. J. Wuennenberg. 2005. The loss of narrative. In ''Ecological paradigms lost: Routes of theory change''. Edited by Kim Cuddington and Beatrix Beisner, 333\u2013370. Theoretical Ecology 2. Burlington, MA: Elsevier Academic.</ref>, Greig-Smith insisted that ecological research should always have experimental tests addressing the insights gained and the hypotheses derived from the quantitative analysis, as in Morton (1974)<ref>Morton, Andrew J. 1974. Ecological studies of a fixed dune grassland at Newborough Warren, Anglesey: II. Causal factors of the grassland structure. ''Journal of Ecology'' 62(1): 261\u2013278.</ref>. Perhaps the main difference with Harper\u2019s single-species experimental approach lied in Greig-Smith\u2019s interest in complex, multispecies systems, and his opinion that projects should start with observations and the search for patterns, before establishing hypotheses about the processes that drive ecosystem functions and experimenting to tests these hypotheses. The debates between Harper and Greig-Smith at Bangor had a large influence on the development of ecological theory in the last four decades of the 20th Century.\n\n=== Greig-Smith's Intellectual Progeny ===\nIn Bangor, Greig-Smith took the view that it was up to his students and young postdocs to define the project, develop the scientific hypotheses, and do the work, provided that they included quantitative ecology, his own area of expertise, in their graduate research. He rarely put his own name on his students\u2019 research papers, so that his enormous influence is visible often only in the acknowledgements of published papers. However, some of the papers written by students and researchers while at Greig-Smith\u2019s lab rank among the highest cited in ecology, and owe much of their originality to Greig-Smith\u2019s mentorship<ref>Austin, Michael P., and L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Orl\u00f3ci. 1966.

Scientifically, he was a disciplinarian and somewhat of a traditionalist but was also a strong proponent of the separation between scientific positions and political or social points of view. In a letter to Michael Barbour, he wrote: \u201c''There may be parallels between ecology and politics but if so I suspect they are coincidental. I see no parallels between my political or social attitudes and my ecological views''.\u201d<ref>Dove, M.R., and D.M. Kammen. 2015. ''Science, society, and the environment: Applying anthropology and physics to sustainability'' (page 11). Routledge (Taylor & Francis Group), London and New York. (ISBN: 978-0-415-71598-0)</ref> Possibly as a result of his work at Trinidad as a young researcher in 1953, he always had a receptive and supportive attitude toward foreign students, and especially toward those from developing countries.

He was a friend and follower of Paul W. Richards, CBE, a professor at Bangor and one of Britain\u2019s most outstanding tropical ecologists. In his obituary of Richards, Greig-Smith recalled the establishment by Richards of the MSc course in ecology at Bangor as a program fundamentally directed to meet the needs of students from the tropics<ref>Greig-Smith, Peter 1995. Obituary: Professor P. W. Richards. ''The Independent'', 11 October 1995.</ref>. After Trinidad, he visited Nigeria in 1966, where he established a long-lasting relationship with the University of Ife as an external examiner. His passion for tropical ecosystems was palpable in the time and effort he devoted to maintain and curate his orchid collection, donated after his death to the [[Treborth Botanic Garden|Treborth Botanical Gardens at Bangor]], as described in [https://www.bangor.ac.uk/alumni/documents/FINAL%20Bangoriad%202011%20English.pdf Retallick (2011)]<ref>Retallick, Simon. 2011. Orchids at Treborth Botanic Garden. ''Bangoriad: Bangor University\u2019s Alumni and Friends\u2019 Magazine'' (Spring): 8. Available at: <nowiki>https://www.bangor.ac.uk/alumni/documents/FINAL</nowiki> Bangoriad 2011 English.pdf</ref>\n\nGenerous with his time both for students and colleagues, he was very active in scientific societies. In the 1960s and 1970s he served the British Ecological Society as its secretary (1961\u20131963), as editor of the Journal of Ecology (1964\u20131968), and as president (1978\u20131979), with John Maynard-Smith as his vice president. Always concerned about maintaining a separation between scientific results and political views, in his presidential viewpoint address in the Bulletin of the British Ecological Society, he advised younger ecologists not to become too specialized: \u201cInsight so often comes from initially unconsidered information and ideas,\u201d he wrote, urging colleagues to maintain a broad curiosity for the natural world<ref>Greig-Smith, Peter 1978. Presidential viewpoint. ''Bulletin of the British Ecological Society'' 9(1): 2\u20133.</ref>. His time as editor of the ''Journal of Ecology'' was the only period in the society\u2019s recent history where only one editor was selected to shoulder the burden of the task, and he carried out the charge with grace and efficiency.\n\nThe Bangor School of Plant Biology took a strong blow in the 1980s, when the British government introduced an early-retirement scheme for university staff in order to save money and confront the economic crisis for public universities at that time. Both John Harper and Peter Greig-Smith took early retirement, and, although they continued to lecture for a few years, they were no longer responsible for the department, and their participation in the recruitment and teaching of graduate students declined. Greig-Smith's students remember him as a caring mentor with a dry but kind sense of humor. His core values were rigor, objectivity, and service to science. Under his leadership, quantitative ecology flourished in Britain and around the world. His intellectual descendants are scattered over all five continents, and the methods he championed now form a fundamental part of global ecological, environmental, and biological studies.\n\n== References ==\n<!--- See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Footnotes on how to create references using<ref></ref> tags, these references will then appear here automatically -->\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\nhttps://www.oxfordbibliographies.com/view/document/obo-9780199830060/obo-9780199830060-0089.xml\n\nhttp://treborth.bangor.ac.uk/glasshouses/orchid.php.en\n\nhttps://www.oxfordbibliographies.com/view/document/obo-9780199830060/obo-9780199830060-0135.xml\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Greig-Smith, Peter}}\n[[Category:1922 births]]\n[[Category:2003 deaths]]\n", "text_old": "'''Peter Greig-Smith''' (b. 1922\u2013d. 2003) was a British plant ecologist, founder of the discipline of quantitative ecology in the United Kingdom. He had a deep influence across the world on vegetation studies and plant ecology, mostly from his book ''Quantitative Plant Ecology'', first published in 1957 and a must-read for multiple generations of young ecologists.[[File:Peter Greig-Smith -1988.tif|thumb|Jubilee Symposium for the 75th anniversary of the British Ecological Society at University College, London held on April 12-13 1988.

Southwood.]]\nIn 1952, Greig-Smith was hired by the University College of North Wales at Bangor, Wales (now Bangor University), where he spent the rest of his academic career. His book ''Quantitative Plant Ecology'' spread the ideas of rigorous, quantitative ecological methods among the world\u2019s research community, and made his lab at Bangor a magnet for plant biologists with an interest in mathematical and statistical methods. A stout supporter of Bangor\u2019s graduate program in Ecology, he recruited and advised many students and research collaborators from all continents.\n\nA prominent member of the British Ecological Society, he was first elected to Council in 1957, and in 1961 he became Honorary Secretary. He held this post until 1964, when he resigned to become editor of the ''Journal of Ecology'', the society\u2019s scientific publication. He remained as editor until 1968. In 1977 he was elected Vice President of the Society, and served as President in 1978 and 1979.\n\n== Mathematics in Ecology ==\nThe postwar period, and especially the 1950s, saw a rising quest for a truly quantitative approach to community ecology. Community description to that point had been predominantly qualitative and had been based mostly on attempts to extend the principles of Linnaean taxonomy into the classification of plant communities. Four innovative ecologists directed their efforts to bring the principles of statistics and mathematics to vegetation analysis: [[John Thomas Curtis|John T. Curtis]] and [[Robert Whittaker|Robert H. Whittaker]] in the United States, and [[David Goodall (botanist)|David W. Goodall]] and Peter Greig-Smith in the United Kingdom. J. T. Curtis, in collaboration with [[J. Roger Bray]], developed the first method of community ordination and also developed the idea of ecological dissimilarity or \u201cecological distance measure\u201d that later opened the way to the concept of niche overlap. Robert H. Whittaker was the proponent of gradient analysis to address fundamental questions of how plants use space and resources. He provided foundational elements for a quantitative theory of biodiversity and was most active in the areas of plant community analysis, succession, and productivity. David Goodall worked as a professor of agricultural botany at the University of Reading, where he developed a series of studies on plant sampling, distribution, and multivariate analysis. In 1956, however, Goodall immigrated to Australia, where he led a sixty-year-long and extremely fruitful career, becoming one of the world\u2019s most renowned ecologists. Greig-Smith, eight years younger than Goodall, became the champion of the quantitative approach in plant ecology in Britain.\n\n== Early Work ==\n[[File:AS Watt.tif|thumb|Alexander S. Watt, Greig-Smith's mentor and one of the most influential British ecologists of the 20th Century.]]\nGreig-Smith went to school in Birmingham, United Kingdom, before going to Downing College, Cambridge, where he was inspired by the teachings of [[Alexander Watt|Alexander S. Watt]], the first British botanist to seriously study the phenomenon of pattern and scaling in plant communities from a quantitative perspective.

The ''Biographical Memoirs'' of the Royal Society show that Watt, in turn, had studied at Cambridge under the mentorship of the ecologist Sir [[Arthur Tansley|Arthur G.

In 1944, after graduating from Cambridge, Greig-Smith went to the Imperial College\u2019s Field Station at Slough, where he studied the effect of herbicides on oilseed crops under the direction of the Geoffrey E. Blackman, founder of the science of selective herbicides in Britain. The Slough herbicide tests, part of Britain\u2019s war effort, involved the planting of large-scale experiments with random block and nested designs, an experience that played a central role in nurturing Greig-Smith\u2019s interest in statistical methods and experimental plot designs. In 1945 he moved to the University of Manchester as lecturer in botany. At Manchester, he cultivated a wide array of research interests, ranging from the taxonomy of liverworts and stinging nettles, the causes of spatial pattern in dune plants, the quantitative morphology and tussock formation of ''Ammophila arenaria'' (a dune grass), and the biogeographic distribution of liverworts to understand the fate of vegetation in the British Isles during the last glaciation.\n\n===Dune Ecology===\nGreig-Smith\u2019s first published paper dealt with the varying growth forms of the dune grass ''Ammophila arenaria'' in calcareous sand dunes on the Isle of Harris, Outer Hebrides<ref>Greig-Smith, Peter, Alan R. Gemmell, and Charles H. Gimingham. 1947. Tussock formation in ''Ammophila arenaria'' (L) Link. ''New Phytologist'' 46(2): 262\u2013268.</ref>. This paper was followed two years later by a detailed description of the dune\u2019s plants<ref>Gimingham, Charles H., Alan R. Gemmell, and Peter Greig-Smith. 1949. The vegetation of a sand-dune system in the Outer Hebrides. ''Transactions and Proceedings of the Botanical Society of Edinburgh'' 35(1): 82\u201396.</ref>, using quantitative methods to describe the plant community. These early papers already mark his interest for quantification of natural phenomena. In this morphometric analysis of ''Ammophila arenaria'', for example, Greig-Smith measured in detail the internode length of the plant\u2019s rhizomes and noted the species\u2019 tendency to form tussock-like clumps in older dunes and longer, exploratory rhizomes in unstable, younger dunes.\n\n===Taxonomy and Biogeography===\nSome of Greig-Smith\u2019s early work was devoted to taxonomy and biogeography, trying to bring a quantitative approach to these branches of the biological sciences. Much of his taxonomic work was devoted to the evolutionary taxonomy and ecology of pounceworts (Lejeunaceae, a family of liverworts)<ref>Greig-Smith, Peter. 1948b. ''Potamolejeunea Holtii'' (spruce) nov.comb. ''Transactions of the British Bryological Society'' 1(2): 108\u2013109.</ref><ref>Greig-Smith, Peter. 1948c.

In 1950 he published a synthesis paper on the taxonomy and biogeography of liverworts<ref>Greig-Smith, Peter. 1954. Notes on Lejeuneaceae: II. A quantitative assessment of criteria used in distinguishing some British species of ''Lejeunea''. ''Transactions of the British Bryological Society'' 2(3): 458\u2013469.</ref>, as an early attempt to shed some light on the question of the effects of Quaternary glaciations on the history of the British flora<ref>Greig-Smith, Peter. 1950. Evidence from hepatics on the history of the British flora. ''Journal of Ecology'' 38(2): 320\u2013344.</ref>. He tried to evaluate how many of the extant British liverworts had survived Pleistocene glaciations ''in situ'' and how many, in contrast, were postglacial migrants from southern latitudes. Almost two decades before the theory of Pleistocene refugia was proposed by [[J\u00fcrgen Haffer]] for the Amazon<ref>Haffer, J\u00fcrgen. 1969. Speciation in Amazonian forest birds. ''Science'' 165(3889): 131\u2013137.</ref>, Greig-Smith was using plant distributions to understand the vegetation changes induced by Pleistocene glaciations, and setting a new direction for Quaternary Paleobotany that few could value in its full significance at that time. As part of the Flora of the British Isles series published in the ''Journal of Ecology'', Greig-Smith drafted a synthesis paper of the natural history of the nettles of the United Kingdom, and a detailed analysis of the communities where they prosper<ref>Greig-Smith, Peter. 1948a. Biological flora of the British Isles: ''Urtica'' L. ''Journal of Ecology'' 36(2): 339\u2013355.</ref>.\n\n===Tropical Ecology===\nIn 1940, Paul Richards, Sir Arthur Tansley, and Alexander Watt published a seminal paper<ref>Richards, Paul W., Arthur G. Tansley and Alexander S. Watt. 1940. The recording of structure, life form and flora of tropical forest communities as a basis for their classification. ''Journal of Ecology'' 28(1): 224\u2013239.</ref> on the classification of tropical rainforests revealing a fascination with the complexity of tropical vegetation that was halted by the war, but that Watt passed down later to Greig-Smith, his student at Cambridge. In July 1948 Greig-Smith received a research grant from the Colonial Office to visit the island of Trinidad to study tropical rainforests. Encouraged by E. Ashby, an early pioneer of quantitative methods who was then professor of botany at Manchester, he left the university for six months to study secondary succession in Trinidad, in collaboration with colleagues of the Imperial College of Tropical Agriculture on the island.\n\nLike Darwin in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest, he was gripped by the complexity of tropical forests. In order to try to unravel and explain this complexity, he developed novel statistical methods to test hypotheses on the association between species and the spatial pattern of saplings and adult trees in the field. An avid naturalist, he also developed in Trinidad a passion for orchids, which led him later to start cultivating his own orchid collection in the United Kingdom. After his visit to Trinidad in 1948, Greig-Smith drafted two detailed papers on secondary tropical forests<ref>Greig-Smith, Peter. 1952a. Ecological observations on degraded and secondary forest in Trinidad, British West Indies: 1. General features of the vegetation. ''Journal of Ecology'' 40(2): 283\u2013330.</ref><ref>Greig-Smith, Peter. 1952b. Ecological observations on degraded and secondary forest in Trinidad, British West Indies: 2. Structure of the communities. ''Journal of Ecology'' 40(2): 316\u2013330.</ref>. The first study included a number of techniques that at that time were novel in vegetation analysis, such as the species-area plots developed by Ronald A. Fisher and Henry Gleason, size-specific survivorship, and quantitative floristic tables. In the second Trinidad paper, he also used nested analyses of variance (ANOVAs), comparisons with the Poisson distribution, and variance-to-mean ratios to test and understand spatial patterns in the trees of the secondary forest. He concluded his paper questioning Frederic Clement\u2019s concept of plant communities as complex supra-organisms, and in support of Gleason\u2019s individualistic model of plant communities.\n\n== Bangor ==\n[[File:Bangor greenhouses.jpg|thumb|Greenhouses of the School of Plant Biology at Bangor in the mid-1970s. Photo courtesy of Bangor University.]]\nIn 1952, Greig-Smith moved to the [[Bangor University|University College of North Wales at Bangor]], where he spent the rest of his career. After the publication of his book ''Quantitative Plant Ecology'' in 1957, which rapidly spread among the research community and became a success, Bangor became a magnet for plant biologists with an interest in quantitative methods. Greig-Smith was keenly interested in the MSc program in Ecology that Professor Paul W. Richards had developed at Bangor, and advised many Masters' students from where he recruited many doctoral students and research collaborators. Most of the students, postdocs, and research visitors in his lab later became outstanding ecologists in their own right, such as Georg Grabherr (University of Vienna), Kenneth A. Kershaw (who moved to McMaster University, Hamilton, Ontario), Michael P. Austin (a postdoc at Bangor, studying tropical forests, who later moved to CSIRO at Canberra, Australia), Robert P. McIntosh (University of Notre Dame, South Bend, Indiana), L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Orl\u00f3ci (also a postdoc, later moved to the University of Western Ontario in London, Canada), Timothy F. H. Allen (University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison), Mark O. Hill (Natural Environment Research Council, Swindon, UK), Michael J. Liddle (Monks Wood Experimental Station, Cambridgeshire, UK; later at Griffith University, Queensland, Australia), Michael D. Swaine (University of Aberdeen, Scotland), M. A. Pemadasa (University of Sri Lanka), David J. Gibson (Southern Illinois University, Carbondale), and Tewolde B. G. Egziabher (Environmental Protection Authority, Ethiopia), among many others. The place was a haven for academic exchange: Laszlo Orl\u00f3ci recalls in his biographical memories<ref>Orl\u00f3ci, L\u00e1szl\u00f3. 2019. ''Looking back: A life of statistical ecology''. 3<sup>rd</sup> ed. Scada Publishing, Canada.

Also available at: <nowiki>https://www.researchgate.net/publication/334432585</nowiki>)</ref> that during 1964 alone, Greig-Smith\u2019s lab at Bangor received the visit of [[Robert R. Sokal|Robert Sokal]] and [[Peter Sneath]], founders of the discipline of numerical taxonomy, and [[David Goodall (botanist)|David Goodall]], William T. Williams, and Mike Dale, who were creating initial content for a solid school of statistical ecology in Australia.\n\n=== Pattern and Scaling in Ecological Sciences ===\n[[File:Scaling design.tif|thumb|In the early 1950s, Greig-Smith started using graphs in which he plotted the variance in plant density versus the size of the sample plot, to find peaks that could identify clump size in aggregated distributions. In doing so, he realized that ecosystem properties are scale-dependent: a species can have a regular distribution at a given scale, but be highly clumped at another.]]\nGreig-Smith was fascinated by the phenomenon of plant spatial pattern, defined by the question: why are some plants regularly spaced while others are densely clumped? He realized that plants could be clumped at a certain scale, but that those clumps, in turn, could be randomly, or even regularly distributed at larger scales. Patterns and processes in ecology, he concluded, can have different behaviors at different scale. Strongly influenced by his early experience in agricultural experiments using random blocks and nested designs, he sought to answer this question by using, as his core tool, a series of quadrats nested within each other at different scales. Much of Greig-Smith\u2019s published work was devoted to advancing the theory and methods of plant pattern, using his nested-quadrat approach as a basic tool. His fundamental idea that the perceived properties of ecological phenomena are scale-dependent set the foundations for the development of a theory of scaling in ecology, a central concept in modern climate change and global sustainability studies.\n\n==== Dunes as Model Ecosystems ====\nOne of Greig-Smith\u2019s early research papers, Gemmell, et al.

''Transactions of the Botanical Society of Edinburgh'' 36(2): 132\u2013136.</ref>, dealt with the formation of tussocks in ''Ammophila arenaria'' and included detailed observations on the clumped distribution of tillers, which form tussock-like clumps in older, fixed dunes but are regularly distributed in the younger, moving dunes. After this initial study, the spatial pattern of dunes and grasslands became a lifelong interest in his ecological research, published in a number of papers with collaborators and students<ref>Gemmell, Alan R., Peter Greig-Smith, and Charles H. Gimingham. 1953. A note on the behaviour of ''Ammophila arenaria'' (L.) Link, in relation to sand-dune formation.

One of Greig-Smith\u2019s students, Andrew Morton, continued Greig-Smith\u2019s pattern analysis studies in the dunes at Newborough Warren in Anglesey, Wales, near Bangor.\n\n====Pattern in Tropical Ecosystems====\nBelow only the study of coastal dunes, Greig-Smith\u2019s interests were strongly focused on tropical ecosystems. After his visit to Trinidad as a young researcher, he developed an interest for African savannas, on the possibility of using his methodology for pattern analysis to understand the importance of intraspecific competition in tropical, strongly rainfall-seasonal ecosystems<ref>Greig-Smith, Peter, and Michael J. Chadwick. 1965. Data on pattern within plant communities: III. ''Acacia-Capparis'' semi-desert scrub in the Sudan. ''Journal of Ecology'' 53(2): 465\u2013474.</ref><ref>Greig-Smith, Peter. 1991.

The use of random and contiguous quadrats in the study of the structure of plant communities. ''Annals of Botany'' 16(2): 293\u2013316.</ref><ref>Greig-Smith, Peter. 1961.

The analysis of pattern in vegetation: A comment on a paper by D. W. Goodall. ''Journal of Ecology'' 51(1): 223\u2013229.</ref>, he showed the importance of scaling in the measurement of plant spatial pattern. He understood that researchers sampling the same vegetation with quadrats of different size could reach diametrically opposed conclusions: a researcher using small quadrats would find that his quadrats harbor either clumps or no plants at all, and would conclude that the species pattern in space follows a clumped distribution. Similarly, a researcher using large quadrats would find a similar number of clumps in each quadrat and would conclude that the species distribution is markedly regular. In reality, both would be right because a species can have a strongly clumped distribution at a certain scale and a regular distribution at another. As president of the British Ecological Society, he wrote an address in 1979<ref>Greig-Smith, Peter. 1979. Pattern in vegetation. ''Journal of Ecology'' 67(3): 755\u2013779.</ref>, in which he summarized his ideas on the importance of scaling in ecological spatial pattern. Some of his students took his ideas and pursued them further: Mark Hill developed a rigorous mathematical theory for the analysis of pattern at a community level<ref>Hill, M. O. 1973. The intensity of spatial pattern in plant communities. ''Journal of Ecology'' 61(1): 225\u2013235.</ref>, while Kenneth Kershaw, after publishing in co-authorship with Greig-Smith, continued exploring for years the drivers of pattern at different scales.\n\n====Scaling in Modern Ecology====\nThe fundamental concept that ecological phenomena could have different behaviors when measured at different scales became really important for understanding large-scale phenomena in the biosphere. The Theory of Scaling became a mainstream concept in ecological research in the late 1980s and 1990s, with the publication of two now-classic papers: Wiens 1989<ref>Wiens, John A. 1989. Spatial scaling in ecology. ''Functional Ecology'' 3(4): 385\u2013397.</ref> and [[Simon A. Levin|Simon Levin]] 1992<ref>Levin, Simon A. 1992. The problem of pattern and scale in ecology: The Robert H. McArthur Award Lecture. ''Ecology'' 73(6): 1943\u20131967.</ref>. Greig-Smith, however, had figured out the main concepts four decades before, and both Wiens and Levin recognized him as a scientific pioneer.\n\n=== Multivariate Methods: Classification and Ordination in Ecology ===\nGreig-Smith was among the first ecologists to understand that multivariate methods were destined to become important tools in quantitative plant ecology. His inclusion of multivariate [[Cluster analysis|classification]] and [[Principal component analysis|ordination]] in his book opened the door for the explosion of analytical approaches and methodological discussions that surged in the 1970s and 1980s. As with pattern analysis, Greig-Smith was ahead of his time: although the potential of multivariate methods\u2014based on matrix algebra\u2014was already recognized in the 1950s, mostly as a result of a growing need for more-rigorous methods in ecology, performing an analysis of a modestly sized floristic matrix of, say, fifty sites and one hundred species was a complicated and enormously time-consuming task. The generalized access to electronic computers, which began in the 1960s, opened the doors for the widespread use of these methods; Bangor\u2019s first computer became available in 1964. Greig-Smith saw in multivariate methods an opportunity to analyze and understand the complex floristic composition of tropical forests, which had fascinated him since his visit to Trinidad in 1948. In 1963 he applied for a grant to investigate the use of quantitative methods to establish whether the highly diverse tropical rainforests showed any organized pattern, particularly in relation to environment, an open question at the time. With these funds, in 1964 he appointed Michael Austin as a postdoctoral research assistant to the project. Three seminal papers were published as a result of their collaboration, highlighting the potential of multivariate methods to analyze floristic patterns in complex, multispecies communities<ref>Greig-Smith, Peter, Michael P. Austin, and Timothy C. Whitmore. 1967. The application of quantitative methods to vegetation survey: I. Association-analysis and principal component ordination of rain forest. ''Journal of Ecology'' 55(2): 483\u2013503.</ref><ref>Austin, Michael P., and Peter Greig-Smith. 1968. The application of quantitative methods to vegetation survey: II. Some methodological problems of data from rain forest. ''Journal of Ecology'' 56(3): 827\u2013844.</ref><ref>Austin, Michael P., Peter S. Ashton, and Peter Greig-Smith. 1972. The application of quantitative methods to vegetation survey: III. A re-examination of rain forest data from Brunei. ''Journal of Ecology'' 60(2): 305\u2013324.</ref>. The power of his approach, merging multivariate descriptive methods with experimental hypothesis testing, is especially noticeable in the work of some of his students like Mike Austin (cited previously), Exequiel Ezcurra<ref>Ezcurra, E. 1987. A comparison of Reciprocal Averaging and Non-Centred Principal Component Analysis. ''Vegetatio'' 71(1): 41\u201348.</ref>, and F.B. Goldsmith<ref>Goldsmith, F. B. 1973a.

The vegetation of exposed sea cliffs at South Stack, Anglesey: II. Experimental studies. ''Journal of Ecology'' 61(3): 819\u2013829.</ref>, among others. Mike Austin later moved to Australia and became one of the country\u2019s leading ecologists.\n\n==== Multivariate Methods as Hypothesis-Generating Procedures ====\nHaving laid the foundations of the discipline of multivariate methods, as a committed naturalist and field biologist Greig-Smith never took much interest in abstruse theoretical discussions, always expressing his concern about the risk of becoming too engaged with theoretical refinements of methodology and repeatedly stating his belief that numerical methods are worth developing only if they are to be used on real data in attempts to answer real questions with relevance in the field. The ultimate evidence, for him, was not in the computer output but in the field. In a synthesis paper published in 1980, he insisted that multivariate methods are simply hypothesis-generating procedures, and counseled students to do experimental tests addressing the insights from the classification and ordination analyses rather than taking the results of their analyses as an unchallengeable truth<ref>Greig-Smith, Peter. 1980. The development of numerical classification and ordination. ''Vegetatio'' 42(1\u20133): 1\u20139.</ref>.\n\n==== Novel Approaches to Multivariate Analysis ====\nGreig-Smith\u2019s later papers on multivariate methods, with Mike Swaine<ref>Swaine, Michael D., and Peter Greig-Smith. 1980. An application of principal components analysis to vegetation change in permanent plots. ''Journal of Ecology'' 68(1): 33\u201341.</ref> and Carlos Monta\u00f1a<ref>Monta\u00f1a, Carlos, and Peter Greig-Smith. 1990. Correspondence analysis of species by environmental variable matrices. ''Journal of Vegetation Science'' 1(4): 453\u2013460.</ref>, were devoted to exploring new and innovative applications for multivariate analysis, including the analysis of time-series data and the exploration of the niche preference of species within a community. In the first two decades of the 21st Century, with the advent of powerful computers and large datasets from molecular genetics studies, the methods of numerical classification and eigenvector ordination, promoted by Greig-Smith half a century earlier, exploded in their use to become indispensable tools in the new molecular approaches to taxonomy, genomics, phylogeography, and anthropolgy.\n\n===''Quantitative Plant Ecology'' (book) ===\nGreig-Smith\u2019s most influential work was his book ''Quantitative Plant Ecology'', used by generations of students and young researchers around the world. The book, first published in 1957, enjoyed two subsequent editions in 1964 and 1982<ref>Greig-Smith, Peter. 1957. ''Quantitative plant ecology''. London: Butterworths.</ref><ref>Greig-Smith, Peter. 1964. ''Quantitative plant ecology''. 2d ed. London: Butterworths.</ref><ref>Greig-Smith, Peter. 1982. ''Quantitative plant ecology''. 3d ed. Studies in Ecology 9. Berkeley: Univ. of California Press.</ref>.\n\nThe success of Greig-Smith\u2019s book triggered the publication of many other similar books, many of them by former Greig-Smith collaborators (such as Kershaw 1964<ref>Kershaw, Kenneth A. 1964. ''Quantitative and dynamic ecology''. New York: American Elsevier.</ref> and Orl\u00f3ci 1975<ref>Orl\u00f3ci, L\u00e1szl\u00f3. 1975. ''Multivariate analysis in vegetation research''. The Hague: W. Junk.</ref>), and nurtured an explosion of concepts and ideas around the quantitative treatment of ecological data, many of which arose in Canada (such as [[E. C. Pielou|Pielou]] 1969<ref>Pielou, Evelyn C. 1969. ''Introduction to Mathematical Ecology''. New York: Wiley-Interscience.</ref>) and Australia (such as Williams 1976<ref>Williams, William T., ed. 1976. ''Pattern analysis in agricultural science''. New York: Elsevier Scientific.</ref>).\n\n=== Holism and Reductionism in Ecology ===\nIn the 1950s and 1960s, at the time when the School of Plant Biology at Bangor consolidated as a global magnet for plant ecologists, an active scientific debate, excellently synthesized in Barbour (1996)<ref>Barbour, Michael G. 1996. American ecology and American culture in the 1950s: Who led whom? ''Bulletin of the Ecological Society of America'' 77(1): 44\u201351.</ref>, was taking place worldwide on the role of holism and reductionism as the main tools to understand ecological phenomena. In Britain, this debate centered mostly on the use of descriptive methods or the quest to understand patterns in nature, as opposed to the use of experimental methods or the search for ecological processes. In Bangor, in particular, the most vocal proponent of an experimental and reductionist approach to ecological research was [[John L. Harper]], who often criticized quantitative vegetation scientists on their descriptive, rather than experimental, approach to research. Roy Turkington<ref>Turkington, Roy. 2009. Obituary: Professor John L. Harper FRS CBE (1925\u20132009). ''Journal of Ecology'' 97(5): 835\u2013837.</ref> recalls that Harper strongly favored the power of simple, direct experiments and distrusted complex multivariate methods, often arguing that ordination methods were \u201ca formalized description of consequences.\u201d \u201cNowhere is this holism more apparent than in the way ecology is taught in many schools and universities with its emphasis on complex systems and the ways in which they can be described,\u201d wrote Harper in \u201cAfter Description\u201d<ref>Harper, John L. 1982. After description. In ''The plant community as a working mechanism: Produced as a tribute to A. S. Watt''. Edited by E. I. Newman, 11\u201325. Special Publication of the British Ecological Society 1. Oxford: Blackwell Scientific Publications.</ref>, and he immediately added: \u201cThere is probably no other science in which students are taught by being dropped into the deep end of complexity.\u201d The contrast between experimental ecology in simplified systems, with only one or a few species, against large-scale pattern-seeking methods led Peter Greig-Smith and John Harper into frequent discussions in the form of good-humored debates following departmental seminars in Bangor, which, as amusingly evoked in Hill (2003)<ref>Hill, Mark O. 2003. Peter Greig-Smith (1922\u20132003). ''Bulletin of the British Ecological Society'' 34(4): 10\u201311.</ref> and Matlack (2009)<ref>Matlack, Glenn R., ed. 2009. ''Memories of John L. Harper: A remembrance by his friends, students, and colleagues''. 2d ed. Bangor, Wales: SPB. Available online at <nowiki>http://people.virginia.edu/~ja8n/Publications/2011</nowiki> Memories of John L Harper.pdf</ref>, were conducted amid legendary clouds of pipe smoke for the benefit of the students, who could see firsthand how academic arguments conducted both with rigor and humor can be very stimulating and deeply entertaining. \n\nGreig-Smith, however, was not really a holist. From his very first papers on the tropical forests of Trinidad, he embraced Henry Gleason\u2019s \u201cindividualistic\u201d model of plant communities. [[Timothy F. H. Allen|Tim Allen]], a Greig-Smith student in the 1960s, recalls that while in the 1980s \u201cthe use of descriptive multivariate methods degenerated into a ritual that community ecologists were expected to perform\u201d<ref>Allen, Timothy F. H., Amanda J. Zellmer, and C. J. Wuennenberg. 2005. The loss of narrative. In ''Ecological paradigms lost: Routes of theory change''. Edited by Kim Cuddington and Beatrix Beisner, 333\u2013370. Theoretical Ecology 2. Burlington, MA: Elsevier Academic.</ref>, Greig-Smith insisted that ecological research should always have experimental tests addressing the insights gained and the hypotheses derived from the quantitative analysis, as in Morton (1974)<ref>Morton, Andrew J. 1974. Ecological studies of a fixed dune grassland at Newborough Warren, Anglesey: II. Causal factors of the grassland structure. ''Journal of Ecology'' 62(1): 261\u2013278.</ref>. Perhaps the main difference with Harper\u2019s single-species experimental approach lied in Greig-Smith\u2019s interest in complex, multispecies systems, and his opinion that projects should start with observations and the search for patterns, before establishing hypotheses about the processes that drive ecosystem functions and experimenting to tests these hypotheses. The debates between Harper and Greig-Smith at Bangor had a large influence on the development of ecological theory in the last four decades of the 20th Century.\n\n=== Greig-Smith's Intellectual Progeny ===\nIn Bangor, Greig-Smith took the view that it was up to his students and young postdocs to define the project, develop the scientific hypotheses, and do the work, provided that they included quantitative ecology, his own area of expertise, in their graduate research. He rarely put his own name on his students\u2019 research papers, so that his enormous influence is visible often only in the acknowledgements of published papers. However, some of the papers written by students and researchers while at Greig-Smith\u2019s lab rank among the highest cited in ecology, and owe much of their originality to Greig-Smith\u2019s mentorship<ref>Austin, Michael P., and L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Orl\u00f3ci. 1966.

Scientifically, he was a disciplinarian and somewhat of a traditionalist but was also a strong proponent of the separation between scientific positions and political or social points of view. In a letter to Michael Barbour, he wrote: \u201c''There may be parallels between ecology and politics but if so I suspect they are coincidental. I see no parallels between my political or social attitudes and my ecological views''.\u201d<ref>Dove, M.R., and D.M. Kammen. 2015. ''Science, society, and the environment: Applying anthropology and physics to sustainability'' (page 11). Routledgen (Taylor & Francis Group), London and New York. (ISBN: 978-0-415-71598-0)</ref> Possibly as a result of his work at Trinidad as a young researcher in 1953, he always had a receptive and supportive attitude toward foreign students, and especially toward those from developing countries.

He was a friend and follower of Paul W. Richards, CBE, a professor at Bangor and one of Britain\u2019s most outstanding tropical ecologists. In his obituary of Richards, Greig-Smith recalled the establishment by Richards of the MSc course in ecology at Bangor as a program fundamentally directed to meet the needs of students from the tropics<ref>Greig-Smith, Peter 1995. Obituary: Professor P. W. Richards. ''The Independent'', 11 October 1995.</ref>. After Trinidad, he visited Nigeria in 1966, where he established a long-lasting relationship with the University of Ife as an external examiner. His passion for tropical ecosystems was palpable in the time and effort he devoted to maintain and curate his orchid collection, donated after his death to the [[Treborth Botanic Garden|Treborth Botanical Gardens at Bangor]], as described in [https://www.bangor.ac.uk/alumni/documents/FINAL%20Bangoriad%202011%20English.pdf Retallick (2011)]<ref>Retallick, Simon. 2011. Orchids at Treborth Botanic Garden. ''Bangoriad: Bangor University\u2019s Alumni and Friends\u2019 Magazine'' (Spring): 8. Available at: <nowiki>https://www.bangor.ac.uk/alumni/documents/FINAL</nowiki> Bangoriad 2011 English.pdf</ref>\n\nGenerous with his time both for students and colleagues, he was very active in scientific societies. In the 1960s and 1970s he served the British Ecological Society as its secretary (1961\u20131963), as editor of the Journal of Ecology (1964\u20131968), and as president (1978\u20131979), with John Maynard-Smith as his vice president. Always concerned about maintaining a separation between scientific results and political views, in his presidential viewpoint address in the Bulletin of the British Ecological Society, he advised younger ecologists not to become too specialized: \u201cInsight so often comes from initially unconsidered information and ideas,\u201d he wrote, urging colleagues to maintain a broad curiosity for the natural world<ref>Greig-Smith, Peter 1978. Presidential viewpoint. ''Bulletin of the British Ecological Society'' 9(1): 2\u20133.</ref>. His time as editor of the ''Journal of Ecology'' was the only period in the society\u2019s recent history where only one editor was selected to shoulder the burden of the task, and he carried out the charge with grace and efficiency.\n\nThe Bangor School of Plant Biology took a strong blow in the 1980s, when the British government introduced an early-retirement scheme for university staff in order to save money and confront the economic crisis for public universities at that time. Both John Harper and Peter Greig-Smith took early retirement, and, although they continued to lecture for a few years, they were no longer responsible for the department, and their participation in the recruitment and teaching of graduate students declined. Greig-Smith's students remember him as a caring mentor with a dry but kind sense of humor. His core values were rigor, objectivity, and service to science. Under his leadership, quantitative ecology flourished in Britain and around the world. His intellectual descendants are scattered over all five continents, and the methods he championed now form a fundamental part of global ecological, environmental, and biological studies.\n\n== References ==\n<!--- See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Footnotes on how to create references using<ref></ref> tags, these references will then appear here automatically -->\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\nhttps://www.oxfordbibliographies.com/view/document/obo-9780199830060/obo-9780199830060-0089.xml\n\nhttp://treborth.bangor.ac.uk/glasshouses/orchid.php.en\n\nhttps://www.oxfordbibliographies.com/view/document/obo-9780199830060/obo-9780199830060-0135.xml\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Greig-Smith, Peter}}\n[[Category:1922 births]]\n[[Category:2003 deaths]]\n", "name_user": "Eezcurra", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eThe Legacy of Peter Greig-Smith:corrected typo in ref. 65", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Greig-Smith"}
{"title_page": "History of the Midlands Merit League", "text_new": "The [[Midlands Merit League]] was a summer [[rugby league]] tournament in [[England]]. In its final two years, it was known as the RL Merit League.\n\nIt was superseded by the [[Midlands Rugby League]], [[North West Merit League]] and [[Yorkshire & Humber Merit League]].\n\n==History==\n\n=== Background ===\n{{main|History of rugby league}}\n\nIn 1895, several clubs in the [[North of England]] broke away from the [[Rugby Football Union]] (RFU), the governing body of [[rugby football]] in England, over the issue of player expenses.\n\nThis led to the great schism which resulted in rugby becoming two separate sports: [[rugby union]] administered by the RFU and [[rugby league]] administered by the [[Rugby Football League]] as the two games evolved different sets of rules.\n\nAlthough rugby league spread overseas, [[Amateur sports#Rugby|sanctions by the RFU]] made it more difficult for the sport to expand beyond its \"heartlands\" in the traditional counties of [[Yorkshire]], [[Lancashire]] and [[Cumberland]].\n\n===Earlier non-heartland competitions and the Rugby League Conference===\n{{see also|History of the Rugby League Conference}}\n\nThe ''Southern Conference League'' began as a 10-team pilot league in 1997 for team in the [[English Midlands]] and [[South of England]] following the collapse of various non-heartland leagues. A further major factor leading to the creation of the Conference was the fact that the professional clubs had switched to a summer season the previous year and thus interest in the sport in the winter was decreased. The abandonment of amateurism by the rival sport of [[rugby union]] in 1995 meant that it was now possible for rugby union players to play rugby league during their off-season without risking a ban from rugby union. This gave non-heartland clubs a larger player pool.\n\nIt was renamed the [[Rugby League Conference]] in 1998 and began to expand; by 2005 there were 90 teams from across England and Wales competing in the Conference.\n\n===Midlands Merit League and its successors===\nThe Midlands Merit League was founded in late 2005 to support this growth in non-heartland areas. Originally intended as a stand-alone league, support from the [[Rugby Football League]] meant that it could be administered as part of the [[Rugby League Conference]] set-up. Interest quickly gathered with 13 teams showing an interest in participating in the inaugural season - 8 eventually participated. The first ever game took place on 8 April 2006 at All Saints Sports College, [[Sheffield]], where the [[Sheffield Forgers]] beat the Chesterfield Spires by 58 points to 8.\n\nThe first cross-league fixture was played in June 2007 when [[Nottingham Outlaws (Rugby)|Nottingham Outlaws]] Academy visited [[Northampton Casuals Rugby League|Northampton Casuals]] of the [[London League (rugby league)|London League]]. They also played a return fixture in July.\n\nThe 2007 season saw the introduction of the [[Midlands Junior League]] as an informal under-15 league based on Merit League principles. In 2008 the junior competition featured under-14 and under-16 divisions.\n\nThe league was renamed Rugby League Merit League (RLML) for the 2008 season due to its increased geographical spread with teams from the [[North of England]] taking part. 2009 saw the largest ever entry, with over 30 teams split into two leagues; \"Yorkshire and Humber\" and \"North West\" with the [[Midlands Rugby League]] becoming its own competition using Merit League rules. A year later the [[Yorkshire & Humber Merit League]] and [[North West Merit League]] became competitions in their own right.\n\n==Season 2006==\n\nThe 2006 competition operated on a merit table basis with teams organizing fixtures amongst themselves. The first fixtures were in April, with the final date for games to be included in the league table being Sunday 13 August.\n\nThe Grand Final for 2006 was held between the top two teams in the table on Sunday 13 August and took place a week later at Hillsborough Arena, home of the [[Sheffield Hillsborough Hawks]]. The final table (13 August) was as follows:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n!'''Position'''\n!'''Club'''\n!'''Played'''\n!'''H-Win'''\n!'''H-Draw'''\n!'''A-Win'''\n!'''A-Draw'''\n!'''Lost'''\n!'''Def.'''\n!'''Pts For'''\n!'''Pts Agst'''\n!'''Pair'''\n!'''Long'''\n!'''Points'''\n!'''Average'''\n|----\n|- align=center style=\"background:#ccffcc;\"\n|'''1'''\n|[[South Humber Rabbitohs]]\n|7\n|3\n|0\n|4\n|0\n|0\n|0\n|386\n|100\n|3\n|2\n|23\n|3.28571\n|----\n|- align=center style=\"background:#ccffcc;\"\n|'''2'''\n|[[Nottingham Outlaws (Rugby)|Nottingham Outlaws]] 'A'\n|7\n|3\n|0\n|3\n|0\n|1\n|0\n|320\n|103\n|3\n|1\n|19\n|2.7143\n|----\n|'''3'''\n|[[Haworth Park|East Riding RLC]]\n|10\n|3\n|1\n|3\n|1\n|2\n|0\n|320\n|164\n|4\n|2\n|24\n|2.4\n|----\n|'''4'''\n|[[Scunthorpe Barbarians|Scunthorpe Braves]]\n|8\n|1\n|1\n|3\n|0\n|3\n|0\n|274\n|238\n|2\n|2\n|16\n|2.0\n|----\n|'''5'''\n|Telford Trojans\n|6\n|1\n|0\n|0\n|0\n|5\n|1\n|149\n|232\n|2\n|3\n|6\n|1.0\n|----\n|'''6'''\n|[[Sheffield Forgers]]\n|8\n|1\n|0\n|0\n|0\n|7\n|0\n|158\n|432\n|3\n|1\n|5\n|0.75\n|----\n|'''7'''\n|Chesterfield Spires\n|10\n|2\n|0\n|0\n|0\n|8\n|1\n|150\n|496\n|3\n|1\n|7\n|0.7\n|----\n|'''8'''\n|[[Lincoln City Knights]] 'A'\n|4\n|1\n|0\n|0\n|1\n|2\n|1\n|94\n|86\n|0\n|1\n|4\n|1.0\n|----\n|}\n\nIn the Grand Final [[South Humber Rabbitohs]] beat the [[Nottingham Outlaws (Rugby)|Nottingham Outlaws]] by 42 points to 18 and became the inaugural champions.\n\n==Season 2007==\n\nThe 2007 season followed the previous year's format, but 2007 also included play-offs and a Shield competition. The regular season closed at the end of July with the play-offs in August culminating in Finals day on 18 August.\n\nThe Grand Final for 2007 was held between St Helens Wild Boars and the German Exiles on Saturday 18 August at Dore Moor, home of the [[Sheffield Tigers RUFC|Sheffield Tigers Rugby Union Club]] and was won 46-22 by the Wild Boars. The inaugural Shield Final, on the same day, was between East Riding RLC and the [[Nottingham Outlaws (Rugby)|Nottingham Outlaws]] Academy and was won by East Riding by 32\u201326.

In its final two years, it was known as the RL Merit League.\n\nIt was superseded by the [[Midlands Rugby League]], [[North West Merit League]] and [[Yorkshire & Humber Merit League]].\n\n==History==\n\n=== Background ===\n{{main|History of rugby league}}\n\nIn 1895, several clubs in the [[North of England]] broke away from the [[Rugby Football Union]] (RFU), the governing body of [[rugby football]] in England, over the issue of player expenses.\n\nThis led to the great schism which resulted in rugby becoming two separate sports: [[rugby union]] administered by the RFU and [[rugby league]] administered by the [[Rugby Football League]] as the two games evolved different sets of rules.\n\nAlthough rugby league spread overseas, [[Amateur sports#Rugby|sanctions by the RFU]] made it more difficult for the sport to expand beyond its \"heartlands\" in the traditional counties of [[Yorkshire]], [[Lancashire]] and [[Cumberland]].\n\n===Earlier non-heartland competitions and the Rugby League Conference===\n{{see also|History of the Rugby League Conference}}\n\nThe ''Southern Conference League'' began as a 10-team pilot league in 1997 for team in the [[English Midlands]] and [[South of England]] following the collapse of various non-heartland leagues. A further major factor leading to the creation of the Conference was the fact that the professional clubs had switched to a summer season the previous year and thus interest in the sport in the winter was decreased. The abandonment of amateurism by the rival sport of [[rugby union]] in 1995 meant that it was now possible for rugby union players to play rugby league during their off-season without risking a ban from rugby union. This gave non-heartland clubs a larger player pool.\n\nIt was renamed the [[Rugby League Conference]] in 1998 and began to expand; by 2005 there were 90 teams from across England and Wales competing in the Conference.\n\n===Midlands Merit League and its successors===\nThe Midlands Merit League was founded in late 2005 to support this growth in non-heartland areas. Originally intended as a stand-alone league, support from the [[Rugby Football League]] meant that it could be administered as part of the [[Rugby League Conference]] set-up. Interest quickly gathered with 13 teams showing an interest in participating in the inaugural season - 8 eventually participated. The first ever game took place on 8 April 2006 at All Saints Sports College, [[Sheffield]], where the [[Sheffield Forgers]] beat the Chesterfield Spires by 58 points to 8.\n\nThe first cross-league fixture was played in June 2007 when [[Nottingham Outlaws (Rugby)|Nottingham Outlaws]] Academy visited [[Northampton Casuals Rugby League|Northampton Casuals]] of the [[London League (rugby league)|London League]]. They also played a return fixture in July.\n\nThe 2007 season saw the introduction of the [[Midlands Junior League]] as an informal under-15 league based on Merit League principles. In 2008 the junior competition featured under-14 and under-16 divisions.\n\nThe league was renamed Rugby League Merit League (RLML) for the 2008 season due to its increased geographical spread with teams from the [[North of England]] taking part. 2009 saw the largest ever entry, with over 30 teams split into two leagues; \"Yorkshire and Humber\" and \"North West\" with the [[Midlands Rugby League]] becoming its own competition using Merit League rules. A year later the [[Yorkshire & Humber Merit League]] and [[North West Merit League]] became competitions in their own right.\n\n==Season 2006==\n\nThe 2006 competition operated on a merit table basis with teams organizing fixtures amongst themselves. The first fixtures were in April, with the final date for games to be included in the league table being Sunday 13 August.\n\nThe Grand Final for 2006 was held between the top two teams in the table on Sunday 13 August and took place a week later at Hillsborough Arena, home of the [[Sheffield Hillsborough Hawks]]. The final table (13 August) was as follows:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n!'''Position'''\n!'''Club'''\n!'''Played'''\n!'''H-Win'''\n!'''H-Draw'''\n!'''A-Win'''\n!'''A-Draw'''\n!'''Lost'''\n!'''Def.'''\n!'''Pts For'''\n!'''Pts Agst'''\n!'''Pair'''\n!'''Long'''\n!'''Points'''\n!'''Average'''\n|----\n|- align=center style=\"background:#ccffcc;\"\n|'''1'''\n|[[South Humber Rabbitohs]]\n|7\n|3\n|0\n|4\n|0\n|0\n|0\n|386\n|100\n|3\n|2\n|23\n|3.28571\n|----\n|- align=center style=\"background:#ccffcc;\"\n|'''2'''\n|[[Nottingham Outlaws (Rugby)|Nottingham Outlaws]] 'A'\n|7\n|3\n|0\n|3\n|0\n|1\n|0\n|320\n|103\n|3\n|1\n|19\n|2.7143\n|----\n|'''3'''\n|[[Haworth Park|East Riding RLC]]\n|10\n|3\n|1\n|3\n|1\n|2\n|0\n|320\n|164\n|4\n|2\n|24\n|2.4\n|----\n|'''4'''\n|[[Scunthorpe Barbarians|Scunthorpe Braves]]\n|8\n|1\n|1\n|3\n|0\n|3\n|0\n|274\n|238\n|2\n|2\n|16\n|2.0\n|----\n|'''5'''\n|Telford Trojans\n|6\n|1\n|0\n|0\n|0\n|5\n|1\n|149\n|232\n|2\n|3\n|6\n|1.0\n|----\n|'''6'''\n|[[Sheffield Forgers]]\n|8\n|1\n|0\n|0\n|0\n|7\n|0\n|158\n|432\n|3\n|1\n|5\n|0.75\n|----\n|'''7'''\n|Chesterfield Spires\n|10\n|2\n|0\n|0\n|0\n|8\n|1\n|150\n|496\n|3\n|1\n|7\n|0.7\n|----\n|'''8'''\n|[[Lincoln City Knights]] 'A'\n|4\n|1\n|0\n|0\n|1\n|2\n|1\n|94\n|86\n|0\n|1\n|4\n|1.0\n|----\n|}\n\nIn the Grand Final [[South Humber Rabbitohs]] beat the [[Nottingham Outlaws (Rugby)|Nottingham Outlaws]] by 42 points to 18 and became the inaugural champions.\n\n==Season 2007==\n\nThe 2007 season followed the previous year's format, but 2007 also included play-offs and a Shield competition.

In response, 1,500 students participated in a one-hour sit-in inside the Administration Building, now known as the LSA Building. In April 1968, following the assassination of [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]], a group of several dozen black students occupied the Administration Building to demand that the university make public its three-year-old commitment as a federal contractor to affirmative action and to increase its efforts with respect to recruiting more African American students, faculty and staff.  At that time there were no African American coaches, for instance, in the Intercollegiate Athletics Department.  The occupation was ended by agreement after seven hours.\n\nFormer U-M student and noted architect [[Alden B. Dow]] designed the current Fleming Administration Building, which was completed in 1968. The building's plans were drawn in the early 1960s, before student activism prompted a concern for safety. But the Fleming Building's fortress-like narrow windows, all located above the first floor, and lack of exterior detail at ground level, led to a campus rumor that it was designed to be riot-proof. Dow denied those rumors, claiming the small windows were designed to be energy efficient.<ref>{{cite news|last=Holmes |first=Jake |url=http://media.www.michigandaily.com/media/storage/paper851/news/2007/04/06/CampusLife/Explained.Colemans.Castle-2827579.shtml |title=Explained: Coleman's castle |work=The Michigan Daily |date=April 6, 2007 |accessdate=April 6, 2008 |archivedate=April 26, 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080426131943/http://media.www.michigandaily.com/media/storage/paper851/news/2007/04/06/CampusLife/Explained.Colemans.Castle-2827579.shtml |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nDuring the 1970s, severe budget constraints slowed the university's physical development; but in the 1980s, the university received increased grants for research in the social and physical sciences.
