Some examples are:\n* Advanced manufacturing processes and [[rapid prototyping]] will make possible for each customer to order one-of-a-kind product without significant cost increase.\n* Collaborative Virtual Factory (VF) platforms will drastically reduce cost and time associated to new product design and engineering of the production process, by exploiting complete simulation and virtual testing throughout the Product Lifecycle.\n* Advanced Human-Machine interaction (HMI) and [[augmented reality]] (AR) devices will help increasing safety in production plants and reducing physical demand to workers (whose age has an increasing trend).\n* [[Machine learning]] will be fundamental to optimize the production processes, both for reducing lead times and reducing the energy consumption.\n* [[Cyber-physical systems]] and [[machine-to-machine]] (M2M) communication will allow to gather and share real-time data from the shop floor in order to reduce down and idle times by conducting extremely effective [[predictive maintenance]].\n\n==Smart Manufacturing Paradigms== \nIn this section, the leading visions for the future of smart manufacturing are discussed and for each one, different examples from leading industry and research organizations are presented.\n\n===Cyber Physical Systems in Smart Manufacturing===\nAs one of the main elements of Industry 4.0, cyber-physical systems play a significant role in the future of smart manufacturing systems.\n* Connection Layer\nSystems, comments, machines, and humans are essential parts of manufacturing systems and their contributions highly depend on their connection with the rest of the manufacturing elements. For instance, an operator may require advanced intelligence from the production system in order to make the most efficient decisions for scheduling maintenance or production orders. Advanced communication technologies such as [[5G|5G technology]] <ref>{{cite journal |last1=Andrews |first1=Jeffrey G. |last2=Buzzi |first2=Stefano |last3=Choi |first3=Wan |last4=Hanly |first4=Stephen V. |last5=Lozano |first5=Angel |last6=Soong |first6=Anthony C.

A digital twin can be realized in this layer by integrating cyberspace to the physical components through [[tactile internet]]. Moreover, similarity-based methods can be used to perform peer to peer comparison across machines and help in better fault diagnosis and enhancing their efficiency.\n\n* Cognition layer\nIn this layer, infographic tools are utilized to present the results of analytic studies to the users. Simple radar charts and degradation trends can be used for a simple representation of the component's health condition. Then operators can easily make a decision based on the presented data.\n\n* Configuration layer\nIn this layer, the decisions made in the Cognition layer are applied to the physical system to make the systems self-adapt, self-configure, and self resilient.\n\n==Statistics==\nThe [[Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry]] in [[South Korea]] announced on 10 March 2016 that it had aided the construction of smart factories in 1,240 [[small and medium enterprise]]s, which it said resulted in an average 27.6% decrease in defective products, 7.1% faster production of prototypes, and 29.2% lower cost.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://businesskorea.co.kr/english/news/industry/14073-smart-benefits-smart-factories-improving-productivity-smes|title=Smart Factories Improving Productivity of SMEs |author=Jung Min-hee |date=March 11, 2016}}</ref>\n\n== Action and effects ==\nFrom Siemens' perspective,<ref name=\":31\" /> there are three core elements to this evolution:\n# '''''Manufacturing execution'''''. Manufacturing execution will play an even more important role. The degree of connectivity between the automation level and the manufacturing execution system (MES) will increase significantly, also across the borders of companies and locations. The integration of Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) and MES levels will also advance to achieve complete transparency as well as connectivity to business data. That means that all necessary information is available in real time.\n# '''''The merging of the product and production life cycle'''''. The second core element is the merging of product and production life cycle based on a common data model. This will allow manufacturers to meet the challenges that result through ever-shorter product life cycles, both technically and in business.\n# '''''Cyber-physical systems'''''. [[Cyber-physical systems]] are a basis for the increase in manufacturing flexibility that results in shorter time to market. These production units can be flexibly integrated into existing production processes. Cyber physical systems combine communications, IT, data, and physical elements using core technologies, including sensor networks; Internet communication infrastructure; intelligent, real-time processing and event management; big data and data provisioning; embedded software for logic; and automated operations and management of systemic activities across enterprises.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Open manufacturing]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* [http://cesmii.org/ CESMII - US National Institute on Smart Manufacturing]\n* [http://ec.europa.eu/research/industrial_technologies/factories-of-the-future_en.html Factories of the Future]\n* [http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2503064 The Smart Factory: Exploring an Open Innovation Solution for Manufacturing Ecosystems: http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2503064]\n* [http://www.techrepublic.com/article/ge-launches-microfactory-to-co-create-the-future-of-manufacturing/#ftag=RSS56d97e7 GE launches 'microfactory' to co-create the future of manufacturing]\n\n[[Category:Manufacturing]]\n", "text_old": "{{merge from|Industry 4.0|date=June 2019}}\n{{buzzword|date=April 2019}}\n{{speculation|date=June 2019}}\n\n'''Smart manufacturing''' is a broad category of [[manufacturing]] that employs [[computer-integrated manufacturing]], high levels of adaptability and rapid design changes, digital information technology, and more flexible technical workforce training.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite journal|title = Smart manufacturing, manufacturing intelligence and demand-dynamic performance|journal = Computers & Chemical Engineering|date = 2012-12-20|pages = 145\u2013156|volume = 47|series = FOCAPO 2012|doi = 10.1016/j.compchemeng.2012.06.037|first = Jim|last = Davis|first2 = Thomas|last2 = Edgar|first3 = James|last3 = Porter|first4 = John|last4 = Bernaden|first5 = Michael|last5 = Sarli}}</ref> Other goals sometimes include fast changes in production levels based on demand,<ref name=\"SMLC 2011\">SMLC 2011</ref> optimization of the [[supply chain]],<ref name=\"SMLC 2011\"/> efficient production and recyclability.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.wilsoncenter.org/sites/default/files/Emerging_Global_Trends_in_Advanced_Manufacturing.pdf|title=Emerging Global Trends in Advanced Manufacturing|last=Shipp|first=Stephanie S.|authorlink=Stephanie Shipp|date=March 2012|website=Emerging Global Trends in Advanced Manufacturing|publisher=Insititute for Defense Analysis |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120606110910/https://www.wilsoncenter.org/sites/default/files/Emerging_Global_Trends_in_Advanced_Manufacturing.pdf |archivedate=2012-06-06 |accessdate=2020-04-12}}</ref> In this concept, as '''smart factory''' has interoperable systems, multi-scale dynamic modelling and simulation, intelligent automation, strong cyber security, and networked sensors.\n\nThe broad definition of smart manufacturing covers many different technologies.

If successful, less human supervision and user instruction for automation will devitalize workplace safety concerns.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.automationworld.com/sensors-discrete/smart-manufacturing-manufacturing-smart|title=From Smart Manufacturing to Manufacturing Smart|last=Louchez|first=Alain|date=January 6, 2014|website=www.automationworld.com|publisher=Automation World|accessdate=2016-03-04}}</ref>\n\n== Impact of Industry 4.0 ==\n[[Industry 4.0]] is a project in the high-tech strategy of the German government that promotes the computerization of traditional industries such as manufacturing. The goal is the intelligent factory (Smart Factory) that is characterized by adaptability, resource efficiency, and ergonomics, as well as the integration of customers and business partners in business and value processes. Its technological foundation consists of cyber-physical systems and the Internet of Things.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.totallyintegratedautomation.com/2014/07/smart-manufacturing-industry-4-0-whats/|title=Smart Manufacturing?

Some examples are:\n* Advanced manufacturing processes and [[rapid prototyping]] will make possible for each customer to order one-of-a-kind product without significant cost increase.\n* Collaborative Virtual Factory (VF) platforms will drastically reduce cost and time associated to new product design and engineering of the production process, by exploiting complete simulation and virtual testing throughout the Product Lifecycle.\n* Advanced Human-Machine interaction (HMI) and [[augmented reality]] (AR) devices will help increasing safety in production plants and reducing physical demand to workers (whose age has an increasing trend).\n* [[Machine learning]] will be fundamental to optimize the production processes, both for reducing lead times and reducing the energy consumption.\n* [[Cyber-physical systems]] and [[machine-to-machine]] (M2M) communication will allow to gather and share real-time data from the shop floor in order to reduce down and idle times by conducting extremely effective [[predictive maintenance]].\n\n==Smart Manufacturing Paradigms== \nIn this section, the leading visions for the future of smart manufacturing are discussed and for each one, different examples from leading industry and research organizations are presented.\n\n===Cyber Physical Systems in Smart Manufacturing===\nAs one of the main elements of Industry 4.0, cyber-physical systems play a significant role in the future of smart manufacturing systems.\n* Connection Layer\nSystems, comments, machines, and humans are essential parts of manufacturing systems and their contributions highly depend on their connection with the rest of the manufacturing elements. For instance, an operator may require advanced intelligence from the production system in order to make the most efficient decisions for scheduling maintenance or production orders. Advanced communication technologies such as [[5G|5G technology]] <ref>{{cite journal |last1=Andrews |first1=Jeffrey G. |last2=Buzzi |first2=Stefano |last3=Choi |first3=Wan |last4=Hanly |first4=Stephen V. |last5=Lozano |first5=Angel |last6=Soong |first6=Anthony C.

A digital twin can be realized in this layer by integrating cyberspace to the physical components through [[tactile internet]]. Moreover, similarity-based methods can be used to perform peer to peer comparison across machines and help in better fault diagnosis and enhancing their efficiency.\n\n* Cognition layer\nIn this layer, infographic tools are utilized to present the results of analytic studies to the users. Simple radar charts and degradation trends can be used for a simple representation of the component's health condition. Then operators can easily make a decision based on the presented data.\n\n* Configuration layer\nIn this layer, the decisions made in the Cognition layer are applied to the physical system to make the systems self-adapt, self-configure, and self resilient.\n\n==Statistics==\nThe [[Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry]] in [[South Korea]] announced on 10 March 2016 that it had aided the construction of smart factories in 1,240 [[small and medium enterprise]]s, which it said resulted in an average 27.6% decrease in defective products, 7.1% faster production of prototypes, and 29.2% lower cost.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://businesskorea.co.kr/english/news/industry/14073-smart-benefits-smart-factories-improving-productivity-smes|title=Smart Factories Improving Productivity of SMEs |author=Jung Min-hee |date=March 11, 2016}}</ref>\n\n== Action and effects ==\nFrom Siemens' perspective,<ref name=\":3\" /> there are three core elements to this evolution:\n# '''''Manufacturing execution'''''. Manufacturing execution will play an even more important role. The degree of connectivity between the automation level and the manufacturing execution system (MES) will increase significantly, also across the borders of companies and locations. The integration of Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) and MES levels will also advance to achieve complete transparency as well as connectivity to business data. That means that all necessary information is available in real time.\n# '''''The merging of the product and production life cycle'''''. The second core element is the merging of product and production life cycle based on a common data model. This will allow manufacturers to meet the challenges that result through ever-shorter product life cycles, both technically and in business.\n# '''''Cyber-physical systems'''''. [[Cyber-physical systems]] are a basis for the increase in manufacturing flexibility that results in shorter time to market. These production units can be flexibly integrated into existing production processes. Cyber physical systems combine communications, IT, data, and physical elements using core technologies, including sensor networks; Internet communication infrastructure; intelligent, real-time processing and event management; big data and data provisioning; embedded software for logic; and automated operations and management of systemic activities across enterprises.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Open manufacturing]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* [http://cesmii.org/ CESMII - US National Institute on Smart Manufacturing]\n* [http://ec.europa.eu/research/industrial_technologies/factories-of-the-future_en.html Factories of the Future]\n* [http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2503064 The Smart Factory: Exploring an Open Innovation Solution for Manufacturing Ecosystems: http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2503064]\n* [http://www.techrepublic.com/article/ge-launches-microfactory-to-co-create-the-future-of-manufacturing/#ftag=RSS56d97e7 GE launches 'microfactory' to co-create the future of manufacturing]\n\n[[Category:Manufacturing]]\n", "name_user": "Quebec99", "label": "safe", "comment": "Fix duplicate ref names \u2013You can help!", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smart_manufacturing"}

Modern technology, such as [[smartphone]]s, exists, but the show features very few cars from after the 1990s, with a majority of cars featured ranging from the 1970s to 1990s. Police cars seen during the finale of series two appear to follow 1990s' aesthetic rather than modern day police cars. As well as older cars the show heavily features older technologies such as [[Cathode-ray tube|CRT]] televisions, and dated household appliances. The d\u00e9cor of the Groffs' house is reminiscent of popular 1970s d\u00e9cor; Maeve's caravan is typical of the 1990s\u20132000s; and the Milburns' house is a more modern d\u00e9cor with a modern, \"American-style\" fridge. Moordale High School also shows some elements of British [[secondary school]]s as well as having a more American high school image. These elements serve to place ''Sex Education'' in an uncertain time period and location. According to showrunner Laurie Nunn, the show's aesthetic is deliberate and an homage to 1980s [[John Hughes (filmmaker)|John Hughes]] films.<ref name=\"Popbuzz\">{{cite web|url=https://www.popbuzz.com/tv-film/sex-education/what-year-set-in/|last=Smith|first=Katy Louise|date=17 January 2020|accessdate=30 January 2020|title=What year is 'Sex Education' set in?

Modern technology, such as [[smartphone]]s, exists, but the show features very few cars from after the 1990s, with a majority of cars featured ranging from the 1970s to 1990s. Police cars seen during the finale of series two appear to follow 1990s' aesthetic rather than modern day police cars. As well as older cars the show heavily features older technologies such as [[Cathode-ray tube|CRT]] televisions, and dated household appliances. The d\u00e9cor of the Groffs' house is reminiscent of popular 1970s d\u00e9cor; Maeve's caravan is typical of the 1990s\u20132000s; and the Milburns' house is a more modern d\u00e9cor with a modern, \"American-style\" fridge. Moordale High School also shows some elements of British [[secondary school]]s as well as having a more American high school image. These elements serve to place ''Sex Education'' in an uncertain time period and location. According to showrunner Laurie Nunn, the show's aesthetic is deliberate and an homage to 1980s [[John Hughes (filmmaker)|John Hughes]] films.<ref name=\"Popbuzz\">{{cite web|url=https://www.popbuzz.com/tv-film/sex-education/what-year-set-in/|last=Smith|first=Katy Louise|date=17 January 2020|accessdate=30 January 2020|title=What year is 'Sex Education' set in?
