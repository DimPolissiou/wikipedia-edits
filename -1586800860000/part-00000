In doing so, a new architectural style emerged that internally emphasised verticality in the structural members, and the effect created by the transmission of light through [[stained glass window]]s.{{sfn|Mignon|2015|pp=8\u20139}}\n\nGothic architecture is most common as [[Christianity|Christian]] [[Church architecture|ecclesiastical architecture]], characterising many mediaeval [[cathedral]]s, [[abbey]]s, and [[Parish church|parish churches]] of Europe.

Many of the finest examples of mediaeval Gothic architecture are listed with [[UNESCO]] as [[World Heritage Site]]s.\n\nWith the development of [[Renaissance architecture]] in Italy during the mid 15th century, the Gothic style was supplanted by the new style, but in some regions, notably England, Gothic continued to flourish and develop into the 16th century.

But, without citing many authorities, such as [[Christopher Wren]], and others, who lent their aid in depreciating the old mediaeval style, which they termed Gothic, as synonymous with every thing that was barbarous and rude, it may be sufficient to refer to the celebrated Treatise of Sir [[Henry Wotton]], entitled ''The Elements of Architecture'', ... printed in London so early as 1624. ... But it was a strange misapplication of the term to use it for the pointed style, in contradistinction to the circular, formerly called Saxon, now Norman, Romanesque, &c. These latter styles, like [[Lombard architecture|Lombardic]], Italian, and the [[Byzantine architecture|Byzantine]], of course belong more to the Gothic period than the light and elegant structures of the pointed order which succeeded them.<ref name=\"Ref_b\">''[[Notes and Queries]]'', No. 9. 29 December 1849</ref></blockquote>{{Location mark+|image=Laon_Cathedral_Interior_02.JPG|width=300|caption=Annotated elevation, Laon Cathedral|alt=|type=thumb|marks={{Location mark~\n| width = 300\n| label = Arcade\n| position = left\n| font_size = 250\n| background = #C0C0C0\n| mark = Red_Arrow_Right.svg\n| mark_width = 30\n| mark_alt = \n| mark_link = \n| x = 750\n| y = 780}}\n{{Location mark~\n| width = 300\n| label = Gallery\n| position = left\n| font_size = 250\n| background = #C0C0C0\n| mark = Red_Arrow_Right.svg\n| mark_width = 30\n| mark_alt = \n| mark_link = \n| x = 750\n| y = 600}}\n{{Location mark~\n| width = 300\n| label = Triforium\n| position = left\n| font_size = 250\n| background = #C0C0C0\n| mark = Red_Arrow_Right.svg\n| mark_width = 30\n| mark_alt = \n| mark_link = \n| x = 750\n| y = 400}}\n{{Location mark~\n| width = 300\n| label = Clerestory\n| position = left\n| font_size = 250\n| background = #C0C0C0\n| mark = Red_Arrow_Right.svg\n| mark_width = 30\n| mark_alt = \n| mark_link = \n| x = 750\n| y = 220}}|float=left}}\n[[File:Sens, Cath\u00e9drale Saint-\u00c8tienne, 1135-1534 (31).jpg|thumb|''Early Gothic'' triple elevation{{Break}}Sens Cathedral]]\n[[File:Canterbury Cathedral - Interior 03.jpg|thumb|''Early English'' choir Canterbury Cathedral]]\n[[File:25-Cath\u00e9drale Saint-\u00c9tienne de Metz.jpg|thumb|''High Gothic'' flying buttresses{{Break}}Metz Cathedral]]\n[[File:Chartres cath\u00e9drale facade.jpg|thumb|''High Gothic'' tower (right){{Break}}''Flamboyant Gothic'' tower (left){{Break}}Chartres Cathedral, ]]\n[[File:Strasbourg Cathedral Exterior - Diliff.jpg|thumb|''Rayonnant Gothic'' west front{{Break}}Strasbourg Cathedral, (1276\u2013)]]\n[[File:Prag, Prager Burg, Veitsdom -- 2019 -- 6662.jpg|thumb|''Flamboyant Gothic'' east end{{Break}}Prague Cathedral, (1344\u2013)]]\n\n== History ==\nArchitecture \"became a leading form of artistic expression during the late Middle Ages\".<ref name=\":1\" /> Gothic architecture began in the earlier 12th century in northwest France and England and spread throughout Latin Europe in the 13th century; by 1300, a first \"international style\" of Gothic had developed, with common design features and formal language. A second \"international style\" emerged by 1400, alongside innovations in England and central Europe that produced both the perpendicular and flamboyant varieties.

By the early 12th century the ribbed vaults, characteristic of Gothic architecture, were coming into use.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}} They appeared at the naves of two Romanesque churches in Caen, France, the [[Abbey of Saint-\u00c9tienne, Caen|Abbey of Saint-\u00c9tienne]] and the [[Abbaye aux Dames]] in 1120.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}} The ribbed vault over the north transept at [[Durham Cathedral]] in England, built from 1128 to 1133, was the first time pointed arches were used in a high vault.

They are also seen at [[Lisbon Cathedral|Lisbon]] and [[Speyer Cathedral]]s, [[Santiago de Compostela]] and [[V\u00e9zelay Abbey|la Madeleine Vezelay]] in conjunction with groin vaults, as well as at the three Norman cathedrals of East Anglia, of which Peterborough and Ely retain wooden ceilings, while Norwich was not vaulted until the 15th century.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\nThe admission of light to the building through a multiplicity of windows was an important element in England.

The architect entirely dispensed with the round arch in favour of the pointed arch and with cylindrical columns in favour of piers composed of clusters of shafts which lead into the mouldings of the arches. The transepts and nave were continued by Adam Locke in the same style and completed in about 1230. The character of the building is entirely Gothic.

The other structural advantage is that the pointed arch channels the weight onto the bearing piers or columns at a steep angle. This enabled architects to raise vaults much higher than was possible in Romanesque architecture.<ref name=BF/>{{page needed|date=April 2020}}\n\nIn Romanesque architecture, the rounded arches of the [[barrel vault]]s that covered the nave pressed directly down on the walls with crushing weight. This required massive columns, thick walls and small windows, and naturally limited the height of the building. Gothic architects found a solution through an innovative use of the rib vault.{{Sfn|Ducher|1988|p=46}}{{Sfn|Mignon|2015|pp=10-11}}\n\nAn early kind of rib vault, used at [[Mosque-Cathedral of Cordoba]] (8th century), was found under a [[cupola]] or [[dome]], but was different in form and function from the later Gothic rib vault. The cupola itself was supported by [[pendentive]]s or [[squinch]]es, a practice used in [[Byzantine architecture]]. The ribs were decorative. The vaults in churches in [[Sicily]] dated to the 11th century, after Sicily had been conquered by the Normans, and resembled the vaults used at the same time in Normandy and England.{{sfn|Bechmann|2017|pp=188\u2013190}}\n\nGothic builders designed a new and lighter kind of rib vault. They divided into compartments by a diagonal crossing of thin stone ribs (''ogives''), and completed by two additional arcs perpendicular and parallel to the nave (''doubleaux'' and ''formerets''). They also made innovative use of the broken arch or pointed arch. In Islamic and Romanesque architecture, pointed arches had usually been used in doorways and windows. Gothic architects used them at the meeting points of the ribs at the top of the vaults, which distributed the weight of the roof downwards and outwards, not just downwards.{{sfn|Bechmann|2017|pp=183\u2013185}} These ribs divided the early vaults into six compartments, each as wide as two traverses of the nave. Some of the ribs went downwards as [[colonette]]s and were bundled into pillars on the ground floor. Other ribs carried the thrust outwards to the walls, where it was counterbalanced by heavy flying buttresses outside the walls. Since the weight was supported by pillars and buttresses, the walls themselves could be much higher and thinner. This made possible the expanses of [[stained glass]] that were a characteristic of Gothic cathedrals.{{Sfn|Ducher|1988|p=46}}{{Sfn|Mignon|2015|pp=10-11}}{{sfn|Bechmann|2017|pp=183\u2013185}}\n\nThe earlier Gothic rib vaults, used at Notre-Dame, Noyon, and Laon, were divided by the ribs into six compartments, were very difficult to build, and could only cross a limited space. In later cathedral construction, the design was simplified, and the rib vaults had only four compartments, and could cover a wider span; a single vault could cross the nave, and fewer pillars were needed. The four-part vaults also made it possible to build the cathedrals even higher. [[Notre-Dame de Paris]], begun in 1163 with four-part vaults, reached a height of 35 meters, remarkable for the time. [[Amiens Cathedral]], begun in 1220 with four-part ribs, reached the height of 42.30 meters (138.8 feet) at the transept.{{Sfn|Ducher|1988|p=46}}{{Sfn|Mignon|2015|pp=18-28}}\n\n===Buttresses=== \n[[File:Strebewerk-2.jpg|thumb|Section of Reims Cathedral with flying buttress over aisles.]] \nAnother important feature of Gothic architecture was the [[flying buttress]], designed to support the walls by means of arches connected to counter-supports outside the walls. Flying buttresses had existed in simple forms since Roman times, but the Gothic builders raised their use to a fine art, balancing the thrust from the roof inside against the counter-thrust of the buttresses.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}} The earliest Gothic churches, including Saint-Denis and Notre-Dame in its beginning stages, did not have flying buttresses.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}} Their walls were supported by heavy stone [[abutment]]s placed directly against the walls.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}} The roof was supported by the ribs of the vaults, which were bundled with the columns below.\n\nIn the later 12th and early 13th century, the buttresses became more sophisticated. New arches carried the thrust of the weight entirely outside the walls, where it was met by the counter-thrust of stone columns, with pinnacles placed on top for decoration and for additional weight. Thanks to this system of external buttresses, the walls could be higher and thinner, and could support larger stained glass windows. The buttresses themselves became part of the decoration; the pinnacles became more and more ornate, becoming more and more elaborate, as at [[Beauvais Cathedral]] and [[Reims Cathedral]]. The arches had an additional practical purpose; they contained lead channels which carried rainwater off the roof; it was expelled from the mouths of stone [[gargoyles]] placed in rows on the buttresses.{{sfn|Ducher|1988|pp=50\u201351}} \n\n{{multiple image\n | align     = centre\n | direction = horizontal\n | header_align = center\n | header    = Buttresses\n | image1    = \n | width1    = 160\n | alt1      =\n | caption1  = \n | image2    =Lincoln, UK - panoramio (30).jpg\n | width2    = 247\n | alt2      =\n | caption2  =  East end of Lincoln Cathedral, with wall buttress, and chapter house with flying buttresses. \n | image3    = Canterbury Cathedral 04.JPG\n | width3    = 245\n | alt3      =\n | caption3  = Wall buttresses and simple flying buttresses behind a parapet at Canterbury Cathedral\n | image4    = Amiens Cath\u00e9drale Notre-dame arc-boutant sud-est 4.jpg\n | width4    = 247\n | alt4      =\n | caption4  = The complex buttresses of Amiens Cathedral support one of the highest Gothic vaults \n | image5    = Arri\u00e8re de la cath\u00e9drale Notre-Dame de Paris en mars 2014.jpg\n | width5    = 274\n | alt5      =\n | caption5  =  The east end of Notre Dame de Paris with flying buttresses supporting the high vault\n }}\n\n==Plan, elevation and parts of a Gothic Cathedral==\n\n===Plan===\n[[File:Cathedral schematic plan en vectorial.svg|thumb|350px|Plan of a Gothic Cathedral]]\nMost large Gothic churches and many smaller parish churches are of the [[Latin cross]] (or \"cruciform\") plan, with a long nave making the body of the church, a transverse arm called the [[transept]] and, beyond it, an extension which may be called the [[Choir (architecture)|choir]], chancel or presbytery. There are several regional variations on this plan. The area where the nave and transept meet is called the crossing, and in England is often surmounted by a stone tower, as at [[Salisbury Cathedral]] and [[York Minster]], visible on a ground-plan by the sturdy piers that support the tower.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}} (see below)\n\nThe nave is generally flanked on either side by aisles, usually single as at York Minster and [[Florence Cathedral]] but sometimes double as at [[bourges Cathedral|Bourges]] and [[Cologne Cathedral]]s.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}} (see plans below). Aisles may extend along the sides of the transepts as well, as at Cologne, [[Amiens Cathedral]] and York Minster.(see plans) In the South of France there is often a single wide nave and no aisles, as at [[Saint-Bertrand-de-Comminges]] and [[Albi Cathedral]]s.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}} \n\nIn some churches with double aisles, or additional rows of chapels between the buttresses as at [[Notre-Dame de Paris]], the transept does not project beyond the aisles (See plan).{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}} In English cathedrals, transepts tend to project boldly and there may be two of them, as at Salisbury and [[Lincoln Cathedral]]s. The double transepts are to provide extra chapels, in lieu of the apsidal chapels found in French cathedrals (See Salisbury plan).{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\nThe eastern arm shows considerable diversity. In France and Germany, the eastern end is generally polygonal and surrounded by a continuation of the choir aisle called an [[ambulatory]]. Surrounding the ambulatory may be a ring of chapels called a \"[[chevet]]\".{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}} In England the eastern arm is generally long and may have two distinct sections- choir and presbytery.

While internally the divisions are created by the locations of the vertical members, externally, the bays can be determined by the positions of the buttresses.{{sfn|Grodecki|1977|pp=14, 17}}\n\nOther elements that are visible on the plans are the locations of towers on the west fronts, porches such as those at Bourges and Salisbury, and the octagonal [[Chapter House]] at York Minster.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\n{{multiple image\n | align     = centre\n | direction = horizontal\n | header_align = center\n | header    =\n | image1    = Plan.cathedrale.Bourges.png\n | width1    = 200\n | alt1      =\n | caption1  = [[Bourges Cathedral]], France, length 125 m.\n | image2    = Plan.redress\u00e9.cathedrale.Paris.png\n | alt2      =\n | caption2  = [[Notre Dame de Paris]], France, length 128 m.\n | width2    = 210\n | image3    = Amiens plan vert.png\n | width3    = 170\n | alt3      =\n | caption3  = [[Amiens Cathedral]], France, length 145 m.\n | image4    = Plan.cathedrale.Cologne.png\n | width4    = 262\n | alt4      =\n | caption4  = [[Cologne Cathedral]], Germany, length 144 m, completed C19th, to dimensions established in C14th \n | image5    = Salisbury cathedral plan vert.jpg\n | width5    = 170\n | alt5      =\n | caption5  = [[Salisbury Cathedral]], England, length 135 m\n | image6    = YorkMinsterPlanDehio vert.jpg\n | width6    = 265\n | alt6      =\n | caption6  = [[York Minster]], England, length 159 m\n }}\n{{clear}}\n\n===Elevation===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2020}}[[File:Gotic3d2.jpg|thumb|300px|Gothic Cathedral, showing nave, aisle, buttresses, arcade, gallery, clerestory and vault]]\nThe most common elevation for a Gothic cathedral or large abbey church is that of the architectural form known as the \"basilica\". This term, used architecturally, does not have any ecclesiastical or spiritual significance such as is associated with Catholic basilicas that have been designated by the pope as a church of great significance, e.g. the [[Basilica of St Peter]], in Rome, or the [[Rosary Basilica|Basilica of Our Lady of the Rosary]] at Lourdes. (see [[Papal Basilica]] and [[Minor Basilica]]){{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\nArchitecturally, a basilica is a church that has a longitudinal nave, with a lower aisle on each side, separated by rows of columns or piers, and generally with windows let into that part of the nave that rises above the outer roof of the aisles. This upper section is called the [[clerestory]]. This architectural form is so named because it was commonly used by ancient Roman builders as the structure for secular [[Basilica|basilicas]] used as halls for meetings, markets and as places of justice. Early Christian churches such as [[Santa Maria Maggiore]], Rome, and [[San Apollinare in Classe]] have this form, which was adopted by Romanesque builders for their great abbeys and cathedrals, across Europe, such as Durham Cathedral, Saint-Etienne, Caen, and Monreale Cathedral.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\nDuring the Gothic period, most cathedrals were built with a single aisle on each side of the nave, such as Salisbury Cathedral, but some had double aisles with the outer lower than the inner, such as Bourges Cathedral. In the South of France cathedrals are sometimes just a single high, wide hall, with tall windows but no aisles, and the lower stage giving a robust fortified appearance, such as [[Albi Cathedral]]. Gothic churches of the Germanic tradition, like [[Stephansdom (Vienna)|St. Stephen of Vienna]], often have nave and aisles of similar height, without clerestory, and are called ''[[Hall church|Hallenkirche]]''.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\nInternally, the nave and choir are usually divided horizontally into three stages, the arcade, the triforium gallery and the clerestorey.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}} This arrangement is usual in England where it can be seen at Salisbury, Lincoln, and Ely.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}} \n\nIn some French Cathedrals, such as Laon and the nave of Rouen, there is a fourth stage, a shallow tribune gallery between the triforium and the clerestory.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}} In the transepts of Notre-Dame, the wall above the triforium gallery is pierced with rose windows. In later Gothic cathedrals and abbey churches, the vertical members in the tracery of galleries and clerestory may merge into a single decorative unit where the stages are present but not clearly defined, as at Saint-Ouen at Rouen and the choir of Gloucester Cathedral in England. {{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\nIn the Gothic cathedrals and abbey churches of Italy, triforium galleries are most often found in churches influenced by the architecture of Normandy, and were used at abbeys of women, as a space for the nuns to attend services.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}} Elsewhere, many churches such as Florence Cathedral and the Abbey Church of Santa Maria Novella, had an interior elevation of two stages, the arcade and clerestory. {{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\n{{multiple image\n | align     = centre\n | direction = horizontal\n | header_align = center\n | header    = French Gothic elevations\n | image1    = Notre Dame 531 transverse crop rot.jpg\n | width1    = 200\n | alt1      =\n | caption1  = Notre Dame de Paris, showing the nave and double aisles; vault and flying buttresses.\n | image2    =Vue.interieure.travee.cathedrale.Paris.png\n | width2    = 183\n | alt2      =\n | caption2  = Notre Dame de Paris.

In France and Spain this is generally a [[rose window]] as at Notre-Dame de Paris and [[Burgos Cathedral]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}} In Italy there is generally an untraceried ocular window as at Santa Maria Novella.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}} In England, rose windows are rare and the west end is generally dominated by a single very large traceried window as at York Minster and Canterbury, while some Early English fronts retain rows of lancet windows as at Salisbury and [[Ripon Cathedral]]s.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}} \n\nThe west front of most French cathedrals and many English, Spanish and German cathedrals have two towers, which, particularly in France, express an enormous diversity of form and decoration.<ref name=BF/><ref name=\"JH1\" />{{page needed|date=April 2020}} In Germany and Eastern Europe there may be a single tall tower at the western end as at [[Freiburg M\u00fcnster]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}} In England, where the principle tower is usually over the crossing, the west front may be framed by large turrets,{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}   \n\nIn Italy, with the exception of [[Milan Cathedral]], the form of a Gothic west front is less strongly architectonic and sculptural than in other parts of Europe.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}} The underlying structure may be brick, rather than stone, overlaid with a veneer of polychrome marble, and ornamented with marble sculpture and coloured mosaics as at [[Siena Cathedral|Siena]] and [[Orvieto Cathedral]]s.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n{{multiple image\n | align     = centre\n | direction = horizontal\n | header_align = center\n | header    = West fronts\n | image1    = Notre-Dame de Paris 2013-07-24.jpg\n | width1    = 180\n | alt1      =\n | caption1  = Notre Dame de Paris- deep portals, a rose window, balance of horizontal and vertical elements\n | image2    = Catedral de Santa Mar\u00eda - Burgos.jpg\n | width2    = 162\n | alt2      =\n | caption2  = Burgos Cathedral, Spain- deep portals, rose window, elaborate openwork screen and spire\n | image3    = Salisbury Cathedral 3 (5691354924).jpg\n | width3    = 148\n | alt3      =\n | caption3  = Salisbury Cathedral- wide sculptured screen, lancet windows, turrets with pinnacles\n | image4    = YorkMinsterWest.jpg\n | width4    = 182\n | alt4      =\n | caption4  =  York Minster, England- shallow portal, very large traceried window, towers with pinnacles, vertical emphasis \n | image5    = Bruxelles katedra 03.jpg\n | width5    = 182\n | alt5      =\n | caption5  = Brussels Cathedral- gabled portal, large window, emphasis on vertical elements.  \n | image6    = Cologne cathedral 2.jpg\n | width6    = 138\n | alt6      =\n | caption6  = Cologne Cathedral- massive towers with very tall spires, completed C19th.\n | image7    = Orvieto kathedrale 1.jpg\n | width7    = 188\n | alt7      =\n | caption7  = Orvieto Cathedral, Italy- balance of vertical, horizontal and diagonal, large portals, polychrome\n }}\n{{clear}} \n\n===East end=== \nThe eastern end of Gothic cathedrals and great churches shows significant regional variation.

[[Chartres Cathedral]] has two on the western towers, of different dates and very different construction.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}} That on the south is the tallest masonry spire of the 12th century, while that on the north is a highly elaborate Flamboyant design.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}} The irregularity seen at Chartres also occurs at Rouen where there is a central tower in addition to the western towers. This tower displays another distinctly French feature, a delicate openwork [[fl\u00e8che]] made of wood covered with lead.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}} \n\nOpenwork spires of stone, sometimes of great height, were popular in the Flamboyant period, occurring singly at [[Strasbourg Cathedral]], Burgos Cathedral, Freiburg Cathedral, [[Stefansdom]], Vienna; and also at Cologne Cathedral and Ulm Minster, both designed in the mediaeval period but not realised until the late 19th century.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}} \n\nIn England, during the Gothic era, there was a continuing fashion for three towers, with the largest being that over the crossing. This arrangement is seen at Canterbury, Wells, Lincoln, York, Lichfield. and Durham Cathedrals.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}} In England, wherever the ground was considered stable, the central tower was surmounted by a spire. Like the south spire of Chartres Cathedral, English spires are often constructed of masonry. The earliest is the comparatively small spire at Oxford Cathedral.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020|reason=the first spire in England surely isn't Christchurch Oxford}} The tallest mediaeval masonry spire is that built in the 13th century at Salisbury Cathedral (123 m - 404 ft).{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}} Others exist at Norwich and [[Chichester Cathedral]]s, while [[Lichfield Cathedral]] has three. Other cathedrals had tall spires of wooden construction sheathed with lead or copper. Two of these, on the central towers of Lincoln Cathedral and [[Old St Paul's Cathedral]] surpassed 550 feet in height and were the tallest structures prior to the 19th century.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}} \n\nEngland's Gothic parish churches and collegiate churches generally have a single western tower.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}} A number of the finest churches have masonry spires, with those of St James Church, Louth; St Wulfram's Church, Grantham; St Mary Redcliffe, Bristol, and St Michael's, Coventry, all exceeding 85 metres (280 feet) in height.<ref>Julian Flannery, ''Fifty English Steeples: The Finest Medieval Parish Church Towers and Spires in England'', T&H, 2016, 10-0500343144 {{Page needed|date=April 2020}}</ref>{{Page needed|date=April 2020}}  \n\nIn mainland [[Italy]], the tower, if present, is sometimes detached from the building, as at [[Florence Cathedral]], or projects from the side of the building as at the Basilica of Santa Croce. In Italy there is no defined stylistic break between Romanesque and Gothic, as the architects had a seemingly pragmatic approach to the use of round and pointed arches.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}} Towers of apparently Romanesque form often appear in conjunction with otherwise Gothic structures.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}} They tend to have graded series of openings in the Romanesque manner like the tower of the [[Badia Fiorentina]]. Some, like the tower at Santa Croce, have large openings of Gothic form and are surmounted by spires.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}} \n\nIn addition to towers and spires, great mediaeval churches, may have several other architectural forms, rising above the roof-line, particularly over the crossing.

The increasing height of cathedrals over the Gothic period was accompanied by an increasing proportion of the wall devoted to windows, until, by the late Gothic, the interiors became like cages of glass. This was made possible by the development of the flying buttress, which transferred the thrust of the weight of the roof to the supports outside the walls. As a result, the walls gradually became thinner and higher, and masonry was replaced with glass. The four-part elevation of the naves of early Cathedrals such as Notre-Dame (arcade, tribune, triforium, claire-voie) was transformed in the choir of [[Beauvais Cathedral]] to very tall arcades, a thin triforium, and soaring windows up to the roof.{{sfn|Wenzler|2018|p=108}}\n\nBeauvais Cathedral reached the limit of what was possible with Gothic technology. A portion of the choir collapsed in 1284, causing alarm in all of the cities with very tall cathedrals. Panels of experts were created in Sienna and Chartres to study the stability of those structures.{{Sfn|Martindale|1993|p=86}} Only the transept and choir of Beauvais were completed, and in the 21st century, the transept walls were reinforced with cross-beams. No cathedral built since exceeded the height of the choir of Beauvais.{{Sfn|Wenzler|2018|p=108}}\n\nA section of the main body of a Gothic church usually shows the [[nave]] as considerably taller than it is wide.

The highest internal vault is at Beauvais Cathedral at {{convert|48|m|ft}}.<ref name=BF/> --->\n\n====Vertical emphasis====\nThe pointed arch lends itself to a suggestion of height. This appearance is characteristically further enhanced by both the architectural features and the decoration of the building.<ref name=Swaan/>{{Page needed|date=April 2020}}\n\nOn the exterior, the verticality is emphasised in a major way by the towers and spires and in a lesser way by strongly projecting vertical buttresses, by narrow half-columns called ''attached shafts'' which often pass through several storeys of the building, by long narrow windows, vertical mouldings around doors and figurative sculpture which emphasises the vertical and is often attenuated.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}} The roof-line, gable ends, buttresses and other parts of the building are often terminated by small pinnacles, [[Milan Cathedral]] being an extreme example in the use of this form of decoration.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\nOn the interior of the building attached shafts often sweep unbroken from floor to ceiling and meet the ribs of the vault, like a tall tree spreading into branches. The verticals are generally repeated in the treatment of the windows and wall surfaces. In many Gothic churches, particularly in France, and in the ''Perpendicular period'' of [[English Gothic architecture]], the treatment of vertical elements in gallery and window tracery creates a strongly unifying feature that counteracts the horizontal divisions of the interior structure.<ref name=Swaan/>{{Page needed|date=April 2020}}\n\n{{multiple image\n | align     = centre\n | direction = horizontal\n | header_align = center\n | header    = Vertical elements\n | image1    = Reims - 2013-08-27 - IMG 2265.jpg\n | width1    = 150\n | alt1      =\n | caption1  = West front of Reims Cathedral \n\n | image2    = Cath\u00e9drale Saint-Pierre de Beauvais ext 106.JPG\n | width2    = 167\n | alt2      =\n | caption2  = The exterior of the choir of Beauvais Cathedral \n\n | image3    = Cenral tympanum Chartres.jpg\n | width3    = 150\n | alt3      =\n | caption3  = Figures around the central door of Chartres Cathedral \n | image4    = The Five Sisters - geograph.org.uk - 770345.jpg\n | width4    = 150\n | alt4      =\n | caption4  = The Five Sister windows in the north transept at York Minster\n | image5    = PM 103594 F Bourges.jpg\n | width5    = 150\n | alt5      =\n | caption5  =  A clustered column of the nave at Bourges Cathedral  \n | image6    = Koelner dom nordseite des chors.jpg\n | width6    = 167\n | alt6      = \n | caption6  = Vertical elements in the galleries at Cologne Cathedral \n | image7    =Koelner dom blick nach osten.jpg\n | width7    = 167\n | alt7      =\n | caption7  = The buttresses pinnacles of the choir at Cologne Cathedral \n\n }}\n\n===Light===\nExpansive interior light has been a feature of Gothic cathedrals since the first structure was opened.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}} The metaphysics of light in the Middle Ages led to clerical belief in its divinity and the importance of its display in holy settings. Much of this belief was based on the writings of [[Pseudo-Dionysius]], a sixth-century mystic whose book {{Lang-la|[[De Coelesti Hierarchia]]|label=none}} was popular among monks in France.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}} Pseudo-Dionysius held that all light, even light reflected from metals or streamed through windows, was divine.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}} To promote such faith, the abbot in charge of the Saint-Denis church on the north edge of Paris, the [[Abbot Suger]], encouraged architects remodelling the building to make the interior as bright as possible.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\nEver since the remodelled [[Basilica of Saint-Denis]] opened in 1144, Gothic architecture has featured expansive windows, such as at [[Sainte-Chapelle]], [[York Minster]], [[Gloucester Cathedral]]. The increase in size between windows of the Romanesque and Gothic periods is related to the use of the ribbed vault, and in particular, the pointed ribbed vault which channelled the weight to a supporting shaft with less outward thrust than a semi-circular vault. Walls did not need to be so weighty.<ref name=NP/>{{page needed|date=April 2020}}<ref name=Swaan/>{{page needed|date=April 2020}}\n\nA further development was the flying buttress which arched externally from the springing of the vault across the roof of the aisle to a large buttress pier projecting well beyond the line of the external wall.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}} These piers were often surmounted by a [[pinnacle]] or [[statue]], further adding to the downward weight, and counteracting the outward thrust of the vault and buttress arch as well as stress from wind loading.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\nThe internal columns of the arcade with their attached shafts, the ribs of the vault and the flying buttresses, with their associated vertical buttresses jutting at right-angles to the building, created a stone skeleton. Between these parts, the walls and the infill of the vaults could be of lighter construction. Between the narrow buttresses, the walls could be opened up into large windows.<ref name=BF/>{{page needed|date=April 2020}}\n\nThrough the Gothic period, thanks to the versatility of the pointed arch, the structure of Gothic windows developed from simple openings to immensely rich and decorative sculptural designs. The windows were very often filled with [[stained glass]] which added a dimension of colour to the light within the building, as well as providing a medium for figurative and narrative art.<ref name=Swaan/>{{page needed|date=April 2020}}\n\n{{multiple image\n | align     = centre\n | direction = horizontal\n | header_align = center\n | header    = Light\n | image1    =  Flying buttresses of Notre-Dame de Strasbourg.jpg\n | width1    = 185\n | alt1      =\n | caption1  = Large clerestory windows between flying buttresses at Strasbourg\n | image2    = Lyon 5 - Cath\u00e9drale Saint-Jean 03.jpg\n | width2    = 185\n | alt2      =\n | caption2  = Tall windows lighting the vault at [[Lyon Cathedral]], made possible by flying buttresses\n | image3    = Chapter House, Wells Cathedral 9 (9317650737).jpg\n | width3    = 185\n | alt3      =\n | caption3  = Windows in a polygonal arrangement, Lady Chapel, Wells Cathedral\n | image4    = Rouen (24748511178).jpg \n | width4    = 185\n | alt4      =\n | caption4  = Tall windows in the aisle at Rouen, with additional windows in the triforium   \n | image5    = York Minster, York (14047415195).jpg\n | width5    = 185\n | alt5      =\n | caption5  = \"Heart of Yorkshire\" window at York Minster, the scale of most west windows in England. \n | image6    = Paris 2019 (31878003887).jpg\n | width6    = 185\n | alt6      =\n | caption6  = The array of glass between thin stone mullions, [[Sainte-Chapelle]], Paris\n }}\n\n\n\n==Evolving styles== \nBetween the dedication of the choir at the Abbey of St Denis, Paris, in 1144 and the completion of [[Henry VII's Chapel]] at Westminster Abbey in 1519, there were nearly 400 years of stylistic development in Gothic architecture. Nowhere was this more manifest that in the building of cathedrals and the great churches of abbeys, colleges and prosperous towns.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}  \n\nWhile the plan and elevation of the various types of Gothic ecclesiastical architecture remained consistently linked to purpose and to regional preferences, all the other elements developed, generally towards greater complexity, over the decades.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}} The piers, the arcades, the galleries, the vaults and the portals, all evolved. The evolution was largely linked to and dependent upon the structural and ornamental flexibility of the pointed arch.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}} \n\nThis development is traditionally divided into periods or styles according to the system of the 19th century French archaeologist [[Arcisse de Caumont]].<ref>Banister Fletcher, 17th edition, p. 534</ref> The periods are generally called Early Gothic (1137-1180), High Gothic (1180-1230), Rayonnant Gothic (1230-1350 and Flamboyant Gothic (1350-1530). These terms apply to the Gothic architecture of France and to those countries where the influence of French Gothic spread. These styles did not, however, progress at the same rate, or in the same way in every country.\n\nIn England, the reconstruction of Westminster Abbey and the east end of Canterbury Cathedral were both influenced by French Gothic, with the architect at Canterbury being [[William of Sens]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}} Wells Cathedral, however, takes a completely different direction to French Gothic, introducing an unprecedented use of fluted mouldings, and other decorative innovations.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}} Salisbury Cathedral and the nave of Lincoln are also very different to the French prototypes.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}} Hence, the styles of English Gothic are referred to as Early English (or Lancet) Gothic (c. 1180\u20131275), Geometric Decorated and Flamboyant Decorated Gothic, (c. 1275\u20131380); and Perpendicular Gothic, (c. 1380\u20131520), after the system proposed by [[Thomas Rickman]].<ref>Thomas Rickman,  ''Attempt to Discriminate the Style of Architecture in England'' (1812\u201315) {{page needed|date=April 2020}}</ref>{{page needed|date=April 2020}} \n\nOne of the indicators of style is the nature of the windows and doors, and their decorative treatment.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}} This is strongly associated with and affected by the type of arches used within the particular building. \nThe Gothic styles, Lancet, Geometric, Rayonnant, Flamboyant and Perpendicular, affected all the various forms of architectonic decoration within the church - arcading, niches, shrines, wooden panelling, furniture of all sorts, reliquaries, vessels, and vestments.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}   \n\n{{multiple image\n | align     = centre\n | direction = horizontal\n | header_align = center\n | header    = Gothic styles\n | image1    = 0 Soissons - Nef et ch\u0153ur de la cath\u00e9drale Saint-Gervais-et-Saint-Protais (1).JPG\n | width1    = 244\n | alt1      =\n | caption1  = Early Gothic at Soissons Cathedral, France\n | image2    = 06-Lincoln-049.jpg\n | width2    = 220\n | alt2      =\n | caption2  = Geometric Gothic at Lincoln Cathedral, England\n | image3    = Auxerre Cath\u00e9drale St. \u00c9tienne Innen Langhaus West 2.jpg\n | width3    = 240\n | alt3      =\n | caption3  = Rayonnant Gothic at Auxerre Cathedral, France\n | image4    = 68532-Salamanca (49093734597).jpg\n | width4    = 240\n | alt4      =\n | caption4  = Flamboyant Gothic at Salamanca Cathedral, Spain \n | image5    = Gloucester Cathedral High Altar, Gloucestershire, UK - Diliff.jpg\n | width5    = 208\n | alt5      =\n | caption5  = Perpndicular Gothic at Gloucester, England\n }} \n\n\n===Arches, windows and tracery===\n====Early or Lancet Gothic====\nThe simplest shape of a Gothic window is a long opening with a pointed arch known in England as the lancet. Lancet windows may be used singly, as in the nave of Lincoln Cathedral, or grouped, as in the nave of Salisbury Cathedral where they are in two in the aisles and threes in the clerestory. Because large lancet windows, such as those lighting the aisles of a cathedral, may be wide in comparison to a single light in a traceried window, they often have armatures of wood or iron to support the glass. The arch of a lancet opening is often equilateral, but sometimes is much more acute, and when employed in the arcade of a choir apse, such as at Westminster Abbey, adds to the emphasis of height.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}} \n\nThe simple shape of the lancet arch may appear in Early Gothic buildings on openings of all types, doorways, niches, arcades, including galleries; and belfry openings.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}   \n\nThe use of lancet windows is found in the Early Gothic architecture of France, at the Abbey of St Denis, and Sens and [[Senlis Cathedral|Senlis]] cathedrals. At Chartres and Laon cathedrals lancet windows are grouped beneath the rose windows. Tall narrow lancets are also found in radiating groups in the chancel apses of some cathedrals, such as Chartres.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}} It is common in France for lancet windows to be used in smaller, narrower spaces, such as the chapels of a chevet, while traceries windows are used in the clerestory.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}  \n\nThe style Lancet Gothic is known in England as Early English Gothic, with Salisbury Cathedral being the prime example. [[York Minster]] has a group of lancet windows each fifty feet high and still containing ancient glass. They are known as the Five Sisters. <ref name=BF/>{{page needed|date=April 2020}}<ref name=CT/>{{page needed|date=April 2020}} Wells Cathedral is notable for the continuous rows of lancet openings that make up the triforiun galleries. \nLancet windows are used extensively in the Gothic churches of Italy, including Florence Cathedral and in the [[Brick Gothic]] churches of Germany and Poland.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}   \n\n====Geometric Gothic (England)====\nThe Equilateral Arch lends itself to filling with tracery of simple equilateral, circular and semi-circular forms. In France, windows of clerestorys, and other larger windows were commonly divided into two lights, with some simple Geometric tracery above, a circle or a cinquefoil or sexfoil. This style of window remained popular without great change until after 1300.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\nIn England there was a much greater variation in the design of tracery that evolved to fill these spaces. The style is known as Geometric Decorated Gothic and can be seen to splendid effect at many English cathedrals and abbey churches, where both the eastern and the western terminations of the building may be occupied by a single large window such as the east window at Lincoln and the west window at Worcester Cathedral. Windows of complex design and of three or more ''lights'' or vertical sections, are often designed by overlapping two or more equilateral arches springing from the vertical mullions.<ref name=CT/>{{page needed|date=April 2020}} \n\n====Rayonnant Gothic====\n{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2020}}\nRayonnant Gothic is the term used particularly to described the style that produced the great rose windows of France. These windows deck not only the west fronts of cathedrals, but often, as at Notre-Dame de Paris, the transept gables as well. It is common that although the transepts of French Cathedrals do not project strongly, they are given visual importance almost equal to the west front, including large decorated portals and a rose window. Particularly fine examples are at Notre-Dame and Chartres Cathedral.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}} \n\n====Flamboyant Gothic====\nThe [[Flamboyant]] Arch is one that is drafted from four points, the upper part of each main arc turning upwards into a smaller arc and meeting at a sharp, flame-like point.{{Dubious|date=April 2020}} These arches create a rich and lively effect when used for window tracery and surface decoration. The form is structurally weak and has very rarely been used for large openings except when contained within a larger and more stable arch. It is not employed at all for [[Vault (architecture)|vaulting]].<ref name=BF/>{{page needed|date=April 2020}}\n\nSome of the most beautiful and famous traceried windows of Europe employ this type of tracery. It can be seen at [[St Stephen's Vienna]], [[Sainte-Chapelle]] in Paris, at the Cathedrals of [[Cath\u00e9drale Saint-\u00c9tienne de Limoges|Limoges]] and [[Rouen Cathedral|Rouen]] in France. In England the most famous examples are the West Window of [[York Minster]] with its design based on the [[Sacred Heart]], the extraordinarily rich nine-light East Window at [[Carlisle Cathedral]] and the exquisite East window of [[Selby Abbey]].<ref name=CT/>{{page needed|date=April 2020}}<ref name=NP/>{{page needed|date=April 2020}}\n\nDoorways surmounted by Flamboyant mouldings are very common in both ecclesiastical and domestic architecture in France. They are much rarer in England. A notable example is the doorway to the Chapter Room at [[Rochester Cathedral]].<ref name=BF/>{{page needed|date=April 2020}}<ref name=CT/>{{page needed|date=April 2020}}\n\nThe style was much used in England for wall arcading and niches. Prime examples in are in the Lady Chapel at [[Ely Cathedral|Ely]], the Screen at [[Lincoln Cathedral|Lincoln]] and externally on the fa\u00e7ade of [[Exeter Cathedral]]. In German and Spanish Gothic architecture it often appears as openwork screens on the exterior of buildings. The style was used to rich and sometimes extraordinary effect in both these countries, notably on the famous pulpit in [[Vienna Cathedral]].<ref name=\"JH1\">John Harvey, ''The Gothic World''</ref>{{page needed|date=April 2020}} \n\n====Perpendicular Gothic (England)====\nThe depressed or [[four-centred arch]] is much wider than its height and gives the visual effect of having been flattened under pressure. Its structure is achieved by drafting two arcs which rise steeply from each springing point on a small [[radius]] and then turn into two arches with a wide radius and much lower springing point.<ref name=BF/>{{page needed|date=April 2020}}\n\nThis type of arch, when employed as a window opening, lends itself to very wide spaces, provided it is adequately supported by many narrow vertical shafts. These are often further braced by horizontal transoms. The overall effect produces a grid-like appearance of regular, delicate, rectangular forms with an emphasis on the perpendicular. It is also employed as a wall decoration in which arcade and window openings form part of the whole decorative surface.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\nThe style, known as [[Perpendicular Period|Perpendicular]], that evolved from this treatment is specific to England, although very similar to contemporary Spanish style in particular, and was employed to great effect through the 15th century and first half of the 16th as Renaissance styles were much slower to arrive in England than in Italy and France.<ref name=BF/>{{page needed|date=April 2020}}\n\nIt can be seen notably at the East End of [[Gloucester Cathedral]] where the East Window is said to be as large as a tennis court. There are three very famous royal chapels and one chapel-like Abbey which show the style at its most elaborate: [[King's College Chapel]], [[Cambridge]]; [[St George's Chapel, Windsor]]; [[Henry VII's Chapel]] at [[Westminster Abbey]] and [[Bath Abbey]].<ref name=CT/>{{page needed|date=April 2020}} However very many simpler buildings, especially churches built during the wool boom in [[East Anglia]], are fine examples of the style.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\n{{multiple image\n | align     = centre\n | direction = horizontal\n | header_align = center\n | header    = Styles- Lancet, Early Gothic, Geometric, Rayonnant, Flamboyant and Perpendicular\n | image1    = Durham Cathedral.jpg\n | width1    = 164\n | alt1      =\n | caption1  = Lancet Gothic windows,west front, Ripon Cathedral, England\n | image2    = Chartres Cathedral clerestory exterior.jpg\n | width2    = 160\n | alt2      =\n | caption2  = Plate tracery, clerestory window, Chartres Cathedral, France\n | image3    = Ripon Cathedral (7557362580) crop.jpg\n | width3    = 137\n | alt3      =\n | caption3  = Geometric Decorated tracery, east window, Ripon Cathedral\n | image4    =  Stra\u00dfburger M\u00fcnster, Gro\u00dfe Fensterrose.jpg\n | width4    = 160\n | alt4      =\n | caption4  = Rayonnant Gothic tracery, west rose, Strasbourg Cathedral, France\n | image5    = Amiens France Cath\u00e9drale-Notre-Dame-d-Amiens-03d.jpg\n | width5    = 180\n | alt5      =\n | caption5  = Flamboyant Gothic tracery, west rose, Amiens Cathedral, France\n | image6    =Limoges curvilinear tracery.JPG\n | width6    = 164\n | alt6      =\n | caption6  = [[Flamboyant]] tracery, nave, [[Cath\u00e9drale Saint-\u00c9tienne de Limoges|Limoges Cathedral]], France\n | image7    =  Kings College Chapel Cambridge west window.jpg\n | width7    = 160\n | alt7      =\n | caption7  = Perpendicular Gothic window under 4-centred arch, King's College Chapel, Cambridge\n | image8    = \n | width8    = 160\n | alt8      =\n | caption8  =  \n }} \n\n===Columns and piers===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2020}}In France, tall untapered columns were common in the Romanesque period.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}} The use of columns of this type was rare in Norman England, where at Durham, Gloucester and Hereford there were massive circular piers built of masonry, and at Durham, alternating with rectangular piers.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}} \n\nIn Early French Gothic architecture, the columns became much more Classical in shape, proportion and the nature of the capital, which was often a modification of the Corinthian capital. Columns of this type were used at the Abbey of Saint-Denis, at Sens, at Notre-Dame and at Canterbury in England. In buildings with sexpartite vaults, they sometimes alternated with piers.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}} \n\nIn the [[Brabantine Gothic architecture]] of the Holland and Belgium, columns remained part of the style into the 15th century, and have capitals of cabbage leaf foliage.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}} \n\nIn France, the column developed in complexity by having a cluster of circular shafts grouped around the central circular core. This is seen a Reims, Amiens and Bourges Cathedrals, and also at Westminster Abbey and Salisbury Cathedral and in Spain at Burgos Cathedral.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}} \n\nThe rectangular piers also developed, with attached shafts and mouldings which continue up the wall to support the vault, or into the decorative mouldings of the chancel arch, in a manner that had previously been utilised to decorate the arches of Romanesque portals. The eastern end of the Abbey of Saint-Etienne, Caen, was rebuilt from 1166, with clustered piers. From 1176, Wells Cathedral was constructed with clustered piers throughout. Between the two buildings there is a great difference in the handling of the two. At Caen, the pier remains a decorated rectangular pier, set parallel to the wall surface. The shafts themselves maintain a circular, and classicising form. At Well, the core of the pier appears to have been rotated, and become a lozenge, angle-on to the lie of the arcade. The clusters of shafts are fluting. The capitals are of what is known as \"stiff-leaf\" foliage, and has a vitality of form different to any other foliage carving of that date.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}} \n\nComplex clustered columns and fluted and shafted piers were subsequently widely adopted, and became part of the vertical visual character of Gothic cathedrals.\n\n{{multiple image\n | align     = centre\n | direction = horizontal\n | header_align = center\n | header    = Columns and piers\n | image1    = Vue du choeur de la cath\u00e9drale.JPG\n | width1    = 197\n | alt1      =\n | caption1  = Corinthian columns in the choir at Rouen Cathedral\n | image2    = PM 103631 F Bourges.jpg\n | width2    = 175\n | alt2      =\n | caption2  = Tall columns with clusters of shafts, Bourges Cathedral \n | image3    = Salisbury 9978.jpg \n | width3    = 175\n | alt3      =\n | caption3  =  Columns in the nave of Salisbury Cathedral\n | image4    =  Wells Cathedral (St. Andrew) (16466400434).jpg\n | width4    = 175\n | alt4      =\n | caption4  = Fluted piers with Stiff Leaf capitals at Wells Cathedral\n | image5    = Seville Cathedral (6931811902).jpg\n | width5    = 175\n | alt5      =\n | caption5  = Very tall fluted piers at [[Seville Cathedral]], Spain\n  }}\n\n===Developments in ribbed vaulting===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2020}}In France the vaults over the high spaces of nave and clerestory, in the Early Gothic period, was sexpartite, spanning two bays of the nave. This resulted in the vaulted space being almost square, and to diagoal ribs being semi-circular. Only the arches of the transverse ribs were pointed. This is the case at Sens, at Notre-Dame de Paris and the Nave of Laon Cathedral.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}} \n\nAt Chartres Cathedral, and the choir of Laon Cathedral, however, the vault is in four parts, spans a single bay, is rectangular, and all the ribs are pointed. The quadripartite proved much easier to build because it required less centring. It is also stronger as the compartments are smaller. The quadripartite vault is used in the Early English cathedrals of Salisbury and Wells. It became the standard form of vault which leant itself to further development and elaboration.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}} \n\nIn the nave of Lincoln Cathedral the vault acquired extra ribs known as \"tiercerons\" which meet at a central \"ridge rib\" running the length of the nave. An additional elaboration, to span the wide nave, was the introduction of intermediate ribs which do not reach the centre of the vault, but join two small \"lierne\" ribs projecting from the ridge. Other cathedrals with tierceron vaulting are Norwich, and Exeter.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}} \n\nLierne ribs became a feature of later Gothic design, as at [[Bristol Cathedral]] and led the way to elaborate patterns within the vault, including net or \"reticular\" vaulting and \"stellar\" vaulting. Stellar vaulting was particularly fashionable in Germany, Eastern Europe and Spain. The use of short ribs lent itself to the introduction of curved and ogee shaped ribs, in the Flamboyant style. Flamboynt vaulting is particularly prevalent in Spain.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}   \n\nIn England there are a number of chapter house, notably at Wells, Lincoln and Westminster abbey, where the vault is supported by a single central column from which many ribs radiate in every direction like a palm tree.

Historians including [[Eug\u00e8ne Viollet-le-Duc|Viollet-le-Duc]], Focillon, Aubert, and [[Max Dvo\u0159\u00e1k]] contended that this is one of the most universal features of the Gothic style.{{sfn|Grodecki|1977|p=20}}\n\nReligious teachings in the Middle Ages, particularly the writings of [[Pseudo-Dionysius]], a 6th-century mystic whose book, ''[[De Coelesti Hierarchia]]'', was popular among monks in France, taught that all light was divine.<ref>Mignon, Olivier, ''Architecture des Cath\u00e9rals Gothiques'' (2015), p. 9 </ref>} When the Abbot [[Suger]] ordered the reconstruction of choir of the [[Basilica of Saint-Denis]],  he had the builders create seventy windows, admitting sa much light as possible, as the means by which the faithful could be elevated from the material world to the immaterial world. <ref>Mignon, Olivier, ''Architecture des Cath\u00e9drales Gothiques'' (2015), p. 9 </ref>\n\nMany earlier Romanesque churches had stained glass windows, and many had round windows, called ''oculi'', but these windows were necessarily small, due to the thickness of the walls. The primary interior decorations of Romanesque cathedrals were painted murals. In the Gothic period, the improvements in rib vaults and flying buttresses allowed cathedral walls to be higher, thinner and stronger, and windows were consequently considerably larger, The windows of churches in the late Gothic period, such as [[Sainte-Chapelle]] in Paris, filled the entire wall between the ribs of stone. Enormous windows were also an important element of [[York Minster]] and [[Gloucester Cathedral]].<ref name=Swaan/>{{page needed|date=April 2020}}\n\nThe main threat to cathedral windows was the wind; frames had to be extremely strong. The early windows were fit into openings cut into the stone. The small pieces of glass were coloured, and then had the color fixed by baking in an oven.  Details such as faces were painted when the glass was cold.  The pieces were joined together within lead frames into panels, which were then combined in larger and stronger lead frames.  Then the finished window was set into the stone opening.   Thin vertical and horizontal bars of iron, called ''vergettes'' or ''barlotierres'', were placed inside the window to reinforce the glass against the wind. <ref>Mignon, Olivier, ''Architecture des Cath\u00e9drales Gothiques'' (2015), p. 22 </ref>\n\nThe stories told in the glass were usually episodes from the [[Bible]], but they also sometimes illustrated the professions of the guilds which had funded the windows, such as the drapers, stonemasons or the barrel-makers.{{sfn|Wenzler|2018|p=28}}\n\nMuch of the stained glass in Gothic cathedrals today dates from later restorations, but a few cathedrals, notably [[Chartres Cathedral]] and [[Bourges Cathedral]], still have many of their original windows.{{sfn|Wenzler|2018|p=28}}\n\n===Sculpture and decoration===\n\nThe exteriors and interiors of Gothic cathedrals, particularly in France, were lavishly ornamented with sculpture and decoration on religious themes, designed for the great majority of parishioners who could not read.

The main portals at [[Notre-Dame de Paris]], for instance, represented the entrance to paradise, with the [[Last Judgement]] depicted on the [[tympanum (architecture)|tympanum]] over the doors, showing Christ surrounded by the apostles, and by the signs of the zodiac, representing the movements of the heavens. The columns below the tympanum are in the form of statues of saints, literally reprinting them as \"the pillars of the church.\"{{sfn|McNamara|2017|pp=158\u201359}} Each saint had his own symbol: a winged lion stood for [[Saint Mark]], an eagle with four wings meant [[Saint John the Apostle]], and a winged bull symbolized [[Saint Luke]]. Sculpted angels had specific functions, sometimes as heralds, blowing trumpets, or holding up columns, as guardian angels; or holding crowns of thorns or crosses, as symbols of the crucifixion of Christ, or waving a container with incense, to illustrate their function at the throne of God. Floral and vegetal decoration was also very common, representing the [[Garden of Eden]]; grapes represented the wines of [[Eucharist]].{{sfn|McNamara|2017|pp=158\u201359}}\n\nThe [[tympanum (architecture)|tympanum]] over the central portal on the west facade of Notre-Dame de Paris vividly illustrates the Last Judgement, with figures of sinners being led off to hell, and good Christians taken to heaven. The sculpture of the right portal shows the coronation of the [[Virgin Mary]], and the left portal shows the lives of saints who were important to Parisians, particularly [[Saint Anne]], the mother of the Virgin Mary.{{sfn|Renault|Laz\u00e9|2006|p=35}}\n\nThe exteriors of cathedrals and other Gothic churches were also decorated with sculptures of a variety of fabulous and frightening [[Grotesque (architecture)|grotesques]] or monsters. These included the [[chimera (mythology)|chimera]], a mythical hybrid creature which usually had the body of a lion and the head of a goat, and the [[Strix (mythology)|strix]] or stryge, a creature resembling an [[owl]] or [[bat]], which was said to eat human flesh. The strix appeared in classical Roman literature; it was described by the Roman poet [[Ovid]], who was widely read in the Middle Ages, as a large-headed bird with transfixed eyes, rapacious beak, and greyish white wings.<ref name=fasti>Frazer, James George (1933) ed., Ovid, [http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:latinLit:phi0959.phi007.perseus-lat1:6 ''Fasti''] VI. 131\u2013,{{harvp|Riley|1851|p=216}}, tr.</ref> They were part of the visual message for the illiterate worshippers, symbols of the evil and danger that threatened those who did not follow the teachings of the church.{{sfn|Wenzler|2018|pp=97\u201399}}\n\nThe [[gargoyle]]s, which were added to Notre-Dame in about 1240, had a more practical purpose. They were the rain spouts of the cathedral, designed to divide the torrent of water which poured from the roof after rain, and to project it outwards as far as possible from the buttresses and the walls and windows so that it would not erode the mortar binding the stone. To produce many thin streams rather than a torrent of water, a large number of gargoyles were used, so they were also designed to be a decorative element of the architecture. The rainwater ran from the roof into lead gutters, then down channels on the flying buttresses, then along a channel cut in the back of the gargoyle and out of the mouth away from the cathedral.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>{{page needed|date=April 2020}}\n\nMany of the statues, particularly the grotesques, were removed from the facade in the 17th and 18th century, or were destroyed during the [[French Revolution]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}} They were replaced with figures in the Gothic style, designed by [[Eugene Viollet-le-Duc]] during the 19th-century restoration.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}} Similar figures appear on the other Gothic cathedrals of France.\n\nAnother common feature of Gothic cathedrals in France was a [[labyrinth]] or maze on the floor of the nave near the choir, which symbolized the difficult and often complicated journey of a Christian life before attaining paradise. Most labyrinths were removed by the 18th century, but a few, like the one at [[Amiens Cathedral]], have been reconstructed, and the labyrinth at [[Chartres Cathedral]] still exists essentially in its original form.{{sfn|Wenzler|2018|pp=99\u2013100}}\n\n==Synagogues==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2020}}<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"175\">\nFile:Blick von der Gartenseite der Synagoge Worms.jpg|Romanesque [[Worms Synagogue]] from the 11th century with Gothic windows (after 1355)\nFile:Scolanova Synagogue.jpg|[[Scolanova Synagogue]], [[Trani]] (1247)\nFile:20190204 OldSynagoga 3715 (33586950518).jpg|[[Old New Synagogue]], [[Prague]] (c. 1270)\nFile:Altneusynagoge - Portal.jpg|Main portal of the Old New Synagogue, Prague (c. 1270)\nFile:Erfurt Alte Synagoge 688.jpg|[[Old Synagogue (Erfurt)|Old Synagogue]], [[Erfurt]] (c. 1270)\nFile:Praha Pinkas Synagogue Interior 02.jpg|Late Gothic vaulting of [[Pinkas Synagogue]], Prague (1535)\nFile:Krakow Old Synagogue G21.jpg|Renaissance interior of the [[Old Synagogue in Krakow|Old Synagogue]] in [[Krak\u00f3w|Cracow]] using Gothic vaults (1570)\n</gallery>\n\nAlthough Christianity played a dominant role in the Gothic sacred architecture, Jewish communities were present in many European cities during the Middle Ages and they also built their [[Synagogue|houses of prayer]] in the Gothic style.

The new fortifications were more geometric, usually square, with a high main ''donjon'' or tower, in the centre, which could be defended even if the walls of the castle were captured. The Donjon of the [[Chateau de Vincennes]], begun by [[Philip VI of France]], was a good example. It was 52 meters high, the tallest military tower in Europe.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\nIn the Phillipienne castle other towers, usually round were placed at the corners and along the walls, close enough together to support each other. The walls had two levels of walkways on the inside, an upper parapet with openings (''cr\u00e9neaux'') from which soldiers could watch or fire arrows on besiegers below; narrow openings (''[[merlon]]s'') through which they could be sheltered as they fired arrows; and floor openings (''[[Machicolation|m\u00e2chicoulis]]''), from which they could drop rocks, burning oil or other objects on the besiegers. The upper walls also had protected protruding balconies, ''[[Bartizan|\u00e9chauguettes]]'' and ''[[bret\u00e8che]]s'', from which soldiers could see what was happening at the corners or on the ground below. In addition, the towers and walls were pierced with narrow vertical slits, called ''[[Arrowslit|meurtri\u00e8res]]'', through which archers could fire arrows. In later castles the slits took the form of crosses, so that archers could fire ''arbal\u00e8tes'', or [[crossbows]], in different directions.{{sfn|Ducher|1988|pp=66\u201367}}\n\nCastles were surrounded by a deep moat, spanned by a single drawbridge. The entrance was also protected by a grill of iron which could be opened and closed. The walls at the bottom were often sloping, and protected with earthen barriers.

[[Giorgio Vasari]] used the term \"barbarous German style\" in his 1550 ''[[Lives of the Most Excellent Painters, Sculptors, and Architects|Lives of the Artists]]'' to describe what is now considered the Gothic style.{{sfn|Vasari|1991|pp=117, 527}} In the introduction to the ''Lives'' he attributed various architectural features to the [[Goths]] whom he held responsible for destroying the ancient buildings after they conquered [[Rome]], and erecting new ones in this style.{{sfn|Vasari|Brown|Maclehose|1907|p=83}} In the 17th century, [[Moli\u00e8re]] also mocked the Gothic style in the 1669 poem ''La Gloire'': \"...the insipid taste of Gothic ornamentation, these odious monstrosities of an ignorant age, produced by the torrents of barbarism...\"{{sfn|Grodecki|1977|p=9}} The dominant styles in Europe became in turn [[Italian Renaissance architecture]], [[Baroque architecture]], and the grand classicism of the [[Style Louis XIV|''style Louis XIV'']].\n\n==Survival, rediscovery and revival==\n{{main|Gothic Revival architecture}}\n[[File:St Giles' Cathedral, High Street, Royal Mile, Edinburgh (57) - The Thistle Chapel.jpg|thumb|[[Thistle Chapel]] at [[Edinburgh's High Kirk]] (completed 1910)]]\n<gallery>\nFile:Christ's Church, Oxford.jpg|Tom Tower, Christ Church College, Oxford, (1681\u201382), designed by Christopher Wren.\nFile:Strawberry Hill House from garden in 2012 after restoration.jpg|Strawberry Hill House, Twickenham (begun 1749, completed in 1776), designed for Horace Walpole.\nFile:Guildhall, Londres, Inglaterra, 2014-08-11, DD 139.JPG|[[Guildhall, London]], main entrance (completed 1788) designed by [[George Dance the Younger|George Dance]] \nFile:Big Ben 1 2012-07-03.jpg|[[Big Ben|Elizabeth Tower (Big Ben)]] (completed in 1859) and the [[Palace of Westminster|Houses of Parliament]] in London (1840\u20131876)\nFile:Ohel David Synagogue.jpg|[[Ohel David Synagogue]], [[Pune]] (completed 1867)\nFile:Frere-Hall-Karachi-Shamail.jpg|[[Frere Hall]], [[Karachi]], (completed 1865)\nFile:Stpatrickscathedralbovenaf.jpg|[[St. Patrick's Cathedral (Manhattan)|St. Patrick's Cathedral]], [[New York City]], (completed 1878)\nFile:Offices of the Prefecture of the Dodecanese 02.jpg|''Palazzo del Governatore'', Rhodes (1927) designed by [[Florestano Di Fausto]]\n</gallery>\nGothic architecture, usually churches or university buildings, continued to be built.

The two western towers of [[Westminster Abbey]] were constructed between 1722 and 1745 by [[Nicholas Hawksmoor]], opening a new period of [[Gothic Revival]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\nIn England, partly in response to a philosophy propounded by the [[Oxford Movement]] and others associated with the emerging revival of 'high church' or [[Anglo-Catholic]] ideas during the second quarter of the 19th century, neo-Gothic began to become promoted by influential establishment figures as the preferred style for ecclesiastical, civic and institutional architecture. The appeal of this [[Gothic revival]] (which after 1837, in Britain, is sometimes termed [[Victorian Gothic]]), gradually widened to encompass \"low church\" as well as \"high church\" clients. This period of more universal appeal, spanning 1855\u20131885, is known in Britain as [[High Victorian Gothic]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\nThe [[Palace of Westminster|Houses of Parliament]] in London by Sir [[Charles Barry]] with interiors by a major exponent of the early Gothic Revival, [[Augustus Welby Pugin]], is an example of the Gothic revival style from its earlier period in the second quarter of the 19th century. Examples from the ''High Victorian Gothic'' period include [[George Gilbert Scott]]'s design for the [[Albert Memorial]] in London, and [[William Butterfield]]'s chapel at [[Keble College, Oxford]]. From the second half of the 19th century onwards, it became more common in Britain for neo-Gothic to be used in the design of non-ecclesiastical and non-governmental buildings types. Gothic details even began to appear in working-class housing schemes subsidised by philanthropy, though given the expense, less frequently than in the design of upper and middle-class housing.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\nThe middle of the 19th century was a period marked by the restoration, and in some cases modification, of ancient monuments and the construction of neo-Gothic edifices such as the nave of [[Cologne Cathedral]] and the [[Sainte-Clotilde, Paris|Sainte-Clotilde]] of [[Paris]] as speculation of mediaeval architecture turned to technical consideration. London's Palace of Westminster, [[St Pancras railway station]], New York's [[Trinity Church (Manhattan)|Trinity Church]] and [[St. Patrick's Cathedral (Manhattan)|St Patrick's Cathedral]] are also famous examples of Gothic Revival buildings.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.architecturaldigest.com/gothic-architecture|title=Gothic Architecture and Churches {{!}} Architectural Digest|website=Architectural Digest|access-date=2017-07-18}}</ref> The style also reached the [[Far East]] in the period, for instance, the [[Anglicanism|Anglican]] [[St. John's Cathedral (Hong Kong)|St. John's Cathedral]] which was located at the centre of [[Victoria, Hong Kong|Victoria City]] in [[Central, Hong Kong]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n<!--- Need to read this through \n==Influences==\n\n===Romanesque and Norman influence===\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"200\">\nFile:Durham Cathedral.

The plan of the Gothic cathedral was based upon the plan of the ancient Roman [[basilica]], which was adopted by Romanesque architecture. The [[Latin cross]] form, with a [[nave]] and transept, choir, disambulatory, and radiating chapels, came from the Romanesque model. The grand arcades of columns separating the central vessel of the [[nave]] from the collateral aisles, the [[triforium]] over the grand arcades, and the windows high on the walls allowing light into the nave were all also adapted from the Romanesque model. The portal with a [[tympanum (architecture)|tympanum]] filled with sculpture was another characteristic Romanesque feature, as was the use of the buttress to support the walls from the outside. Gothic architects improved them by adding the [[flying buttress]] with high arches connecting the buttresses to the upper walls. In the interior, Romanesque architecture used the [[barrel vault]] with a round arch to cover the nave, and a [[groin vault]] when two barrel vaults met at right angles. These vaults were the immediate ancestors of the Gothic rib vault. The first use of the Gothic rib vaults to cover a nave was in the Romanesque [[Durham Cathedral]], (1093\u20131104).<ref name=\"auto\">Weber, Patrick, ''Histoire de l'Architecture'' (2018), pp. 35-37</ref>\n\n[[Norman Architecture]], similar to the Romanesque style, also influenced the Gothic style. Early examples are found in [[Lessay Abbey]] in Normandy, which also featured early rib vaults in the nave similar to the Gothic vaults. [[Cefalu Cathedral]] (1131\u20131267) in Sicily, built when Sicily was under Norman rule, is another interesting example. It featured pointed arches and large Romanesque vaults combined with ornamental mosaic decoration.<ref name=\"auto\"/>\n\nRomanesque architecture had become a pan-European style and manner of construction, affecting buildings in countries as far apart as [[Ireland]] and [[Croatia]], and [[Sweden]] and [[Sicily]]. The same wide geographic area was then affected by the development of Gothic architecture, but the acceptance of the Gothic style and methods of construction differed from place to place, as did the expressions of Gothic taste. The proximity of some regions meant that modern country borders did not define divisions of style. Many different factors like geographical/geological, economic, social, or political situations caused the regional differences in the great abbey churches and cathedrals of the Romanesque period that would often become even more apparent in the Gothic. For example, studies of the population statistics reveals disparities such as the multitude of churches, abbeys, and cathedrals in northern [[France]] while in more urbanised regions construction activity of a similar scale was reserved to a few important cities. Such an example comes from Roberto L\u00f3pez, wherein the French city of [[Amiens]] was able to fund its architectural projects whereas [[Cologne]] could not because of the economic inequality of the two.{{sfn|Grodecki|1977|p=25-26}} This wealth, concentrated in rich monasteries and noble families, would eventually spread certain Italian, Catalan, and Hanseatic bankers.{{sfn|Grodecki|1977|p=25}} This would be amended when the economic hardships of the 13th century were no longer felt, allowing [[Normandy]], [[Tuscany]], [[Flanders]], and the southern [[Rhineland]] to enter into competition with France.{{sfn|Grodecki|1977|p=26}} \n\n===Islamic and Armenian influence===\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"200\">\nAl-Ukhaidir Fortess.jpg|[[Al-Ukhaidir Fortress]] (completed 775 AD), Iraq\nJerusalem-2013-Al-Aqsa Mosque 04.jpg|[[Al-Aqsa Mosque]], Jerusalem\nCordoba, la Mezquita - C\u00fapula de la Maqsura.jpg|Vaulted central dome of [[Cordoba Cathedral|Cordoba Mosque-Cathedral]], Spain (784\u2013987 A.D.).

It also appears in one of the early reconstructions of the [[Great Mosque of Kairouan]] in Tunisia, and the Mosque\u2013Cathedral of C\u00f3rdoba in 987 AD. The pointed arch had already been used in Syria, but in the mosque of Ibn Tulun we have one of the earliest examples of its use on an extensive scale, some centuries before it was exploited in the West by the Gothic architects.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Islamic Art|last=Rice|first=David T.|publisher=Thames & Hudson|year=1979|isbn=9780500201503|pages=[https://archive.org/details/islamicartworldo00davi/page/45 45]|url=https://archive.org/details/islamicartworldo00davi/page/45}}</ref>\n\nA kind of [[rib vault]] was also used in Islamic architecture, for example in the ceiling of the [[Mosque-Cathedral of Cordoba]]. In Cordoba, the dome was supported by [[pendentives]], which connected the dome to the arches below. The pendentives were decorated with ribs. Unlike the Gothic rib vault, the Islamic ribs were purely decorative; they did not extend outside of the vault, and they were not part of the structure supporting the roof. \n\nThe military and [[Islamic world contributions to Medieval Europe|cultural contacts with]] the [[medieval Islamic world]], including the [[Norman conquest of southern Italy|Norman conquest]] of [[History of Islam in southern Italy|Islamic Sicily]] in 1090, the [[Crusades]] (beginning 1096), and the [[Al-Andalus|Islamic presence in Spain]], may have influenced [[Medieval Europe]]'s adoption of the pointed arch.{{sfn|Scott|2003|p=113}}{{sfn|Bony|1983|p=17}} Another feature of Gothic architecture, a kind of rib vault, had also earlier appeared in Islamic architecture, and spread to Western Europe via [[Al-Andalus|Islamic Spain]] and [[Emirate of Sicily|Sicily]].<ref name=\"Bloom\"/><ref name=Giese-Vogeli>{{cite book|last=Giese-V\u00f6geli|first=Francine|title=Das islamische Rippengew\u00f6lbe : Ursprung, Form, Verbreitung |trans-title=Islamic rib vaults: Origins, form, spread|date=2007|publisher=Gebr.

It is the primary engineering innovation and the characteristic design component. The use of the pointed arch in turn led to the development of the pointed [[ribbed vault]], the [[flying buttress]] and window tracery.<ref>Bannister Fletcher, 17th edition, p.367, p.524</ref> These elements together formed a structurally and aesthetically integrated system, or style, that characterises the Gothic.<ref>Moffett, Fazio and Wodehouse, p.230</ref>\n\nAt the [[Basilica of Saint-Denis]], near Paris, the choir was reconstructed between 1140 and 1144, drawing together for the first time the developing Gothic architectural features. In doing so, a new architectural style emerged that internally emphasised verticality in the structural members, and the effect created by the transmission of light through [[stained glass window]]s.{{sfn|Mignon|2015|pp=8\u20139}}\n\nGothic architecture is most common as [[Christianity|Christian]] [[Church architecture|ecclesiastical architecture]], characterising many mediaeval [[cathedral]]s, [[abbey]]s, and [[Parish church|parish churches]] of Europe. It is also the architecture of many [[castle]]s, [[palace]]s, [[town hall]]s, [[guildhall]]<nowiki/>s, universities and less prominently, private dwellings. Many of the finest examples of mediaeval Gothic architecture are listed with [[UNESCO]] as [[World Heritage Site]]s.\n\nWith the development of [[Renaissance architecture]] in Italy during the mid 15th century, the Gothic style was supplanted by the new style, but in some regions, notably England, Gothic continued to flourish and develop into the 16th century. A series of [[Gothic Revival architecture|Gothic revivals]] began in mid-18th century England, spread through 19th century Europe and continued, largely for ecclesiastical and university structures, into the 20th century.\n\n==Name== \nGothic architecture is also known as pointed architecture or ogival architecture.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref>{{Citation|last=|first=|title=ogive|date=2015|url=https://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/acref/9780199674985.001.0001/acref-9780199674985-e-3177|work=A Dictionary of Architecture and Landscape Architecture|volume=|pages=|editor-last=Curl|editor-first=James Stevens|edition=3rd|publisher=Oxford University Press|language=en|doi=10.1093/acref/9780199674985.001.0001/acref-9780199674985-e-3177|isbn=978-0-19-967498-5|access-date=2020-04-09|editor2-last=Wilson|editor2-first=Susan}}</ref> Mediaeval contemporaries described the style as {{Lang-la|opus Francigenum|lit=French work' or '[[Frankish]] work}}, as {{Lang-la|opus modernum|lit=modern work|label=none}}, {{Lang-la|novum opus|lit=new work|label=none}}, or as {{Lang-it|maniera tedesca|lit=German style}}.<ref>{{Citation|last=Bogdanovi\u0107|first=Jelena|title=opus Francigenum|date=2010-01-01|url=https://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/acref/9780198662624.001.0001/acref-9780198662624-e-4321|work=The Oxford Dictionary of the Middle Ages|volume=|pages=|editor-last=Bjork|editor-first=Robert E.|publisher=Oxford University Press|language=en|doi=10.1093/acref/9780198662624.001.0001/acref-9780198662624-e-4321|isbn=978-0-19-866262-4|access-date=2020-04-09}}</ref><ref>Bannister Fletcher, p.524</ref>\n\nThe term \"[[Gothic (disambiguation)|Gothic]] architecture\" originated as a [[pejorative]] description.

Vasari was echoed in the 16th century by [[Fran\u00e7ois Rabelais]], who referred to [[Goths]] and [[Ostrogoths]] (''Gotz'' and ''Ostrogotz'').<ref name=\"Ref_a\">\"Gotz\" is rendered as \"Huns\" in [[Thomas Urquhart]]'s English translation.</ref>{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\nAccording to a 19th-century correspondent in the London journal ''[[Notes and Queries]]'', Gothic was a derisive misnomer; the pointed arcs and architecture of the [[Late Middle Ages|later Middle Ages]] was quite different to the rounded arches prevalent in [[late antiquity]] and the period of the [[Ostrogothic Kingdom]] in Italy:\n<blockquote>There can be no doubt that the term 'Gothic' as applied to pointed styles of ecclesiastical architecture was used at first contemptuously, and in derision, by those who were ambitious to imitate and revive the Grecian orders of architecture, after the revival of classical literature.

They are also seen at [[Lisbon Cathedral|Lisbon]] and [[Speyer Cathedral]]s, [[Santiago de Compostela]] and [[V\u00e9zelay Abbey|la Madeleine Vezelay]] in conjunction with groin vaults, as well as at the three Norman cathedrals of East Anglia, of which Peterborough and Ely retain wooden ceilings, while Norwich was not vaulted until the 15th century.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\nThe admission of light to the building through a multiplicity of windows was an important element in England. At Peterborough Cathedral, the polygonal Norman apse has remained, as has three tiers of large Norman windows, now filled with Gothic tracery and 19th century stained glass.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}} The transept ends at Peterborough, Ely and Norwich each have three rows of large Norman windows.

The architect entirely dispensed with the round arch in favour of the pointed arch and with cylindrical columns in favour of piers composed of clusters of shafts which lead into the mouldings of the arches. The transepts and nave were continued by Adam Locke in the same style and completed in about 1230. The character of the building is entirely Gothic.

The other structural advantage is that the pointed arch channels the weight onto the bearing piers or columns at a steep angle. This enabled architects to raise vaults much higher than was possible in Romanesque architecture.<ref name=BF/>{{page needed|date=April 2020}}\n\nIn Romanesque architecture, the rounded arches of the [[barrel vault]]s that covered the nave pressed directly down on the walls with crushing weight. This required massive columns, thick walls and small windows, and naturally limited the height of the building. Gothic architects found a solution through an innovative use of the rib vault.{{Sfn|Ducher|1988|p=46}}{{Sfn|Mignon|2015|pp=10-11}}\n\nAn early kind of rib vault, used at [[Mosque-Cathedral of Cordoba]] (8th century), was found under a [[cupola]] or [[dome]], but was different in form and function from the later Gothic rib vault. The cupola itself was supported by [[pendentive]]s or [[squinch]]es, a practice used in [[Byzantine architecture]]. The ribs were decorative. The vaults in churches in [[Sicily]] dated to the 11th century, after Sicily had been conquered by the Normans, and resembled the vaults used at the same time in Normandy and England.{{sfn|Bechmann|2017|pp=188\u2013190}}\n\nGothic builders designed a new and lighter kind of rib vault. They divided into compartments by a diagonal crossing of thin stone ribs (''ogives''), and completed by two additional arcs perpendicular and parallel to the nave (''doubleaux'' and ''formerets''). They also made innovative use of the broken arch or pointed arch. In Islamic and Romanesque architecture, pointed arches had usually been used in doorways and windows. Gothic architects used them at the meeting points of the ribs at the top of the vaults, which distributed the weight of the roof downwards and outwards, not just downwards.{{sfn|Bechmann|2017|pp=183\u2013185}} These ribs divided the early vaults into six compartments, each as wide as two traverses of the nave. Some of the ribs went downwards as [[colonette]]s and were bundled into pillars on the ground floor. Other ribs carried the thrust outwards to the walls, where it was counterbalanced by heavy flying buttresses outside the walls. Since the weight was supported by pillars and buttresses, the walls themselves could be much higher and thinner. This made possible the expanses of [[stained glass]] that were a characteristic of Gothic cathedrals.{{Sfn|Ducher|1988|p=46}}{{Sfn|Mignon|2015|pp=10-11}}{{sfn|Bechmann|2017|pp=183\u2013185}}\n\nThe earlier Gothic rib vaults, used at Notre-Dame, Noyon, and Laon, were divided by the ribs into six compartments, were very difficult to build, and could only cross a limited space. In later cathedral construction, the design was simplified, and the rib vaults had only four compartments, and could cover a wider span; a single vault could cross the nave, and fewer pillars were needed. The four-part vaults also made it possible to build the cathedrals even higher. [[Notre-Dame de Paris]], begun in 1163 with four-part vaults, reached a height of 35 meters, remarkable for the time. [[Amiens Cathedral]], begun in 1220 with four-part ribs, reached the height of 42.30 meters (138.8 feet) at the transept.{{Sfn|Ducher|1988|p=46}}{{Sfn|Mignon|2015|pp=18-28}}\n\n===Buttresses=== \n[[File:Strebewerk-2.jpg|thumb|Section of Reims Cathedral with flying buttress over aisles.]] \nAnother important feature of Gothic architecture was the [[flying buttress]], designed to support the walls by means of arches connected to counter-supports outside the walls. Flying buttresses had existed in simple forms since Roman times, but the Gothic builders raised their use to a fine art, balancing the thrust from the roof inside against the counter-thrust of the buttresses.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}} The earliest Gothic churches, including Saint-Denis and Notre-Dame in its beginning stages, did not have flying buttresses.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}} Their walls were supported by heavy stone [[abutment]]s placed directly against the walls.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}} The roof was supported by the ribs of the vaults, which were bundled with the columns below.\n\nIn the later 12th and early 13th century, the buttresses became more sophisticated. New arches carried the thrust of the weight entirely outside the walls, where it was met by the counter-thrust of stone columns, with pinnacles placed on top for decoration and for additional weight. Thanks to this system of external buttresses, the walls could be higher and thinner, and could support larger stained glass windows. The buttresses themselves became part of the decoration; the pinnacles became more and more ornate, becoming more and more elaborate, as at [[Beauvais Cathedral]] and [[Reims Cathedral]]. The arches had an additional practical purpose; they contained lead channels which carried rainwater off the roof; it was expelled from the mouths of stone [[gargoyles]] placed in rows on the buttresses.{{sfn|Ducher|1988|pp=50\u201351}} \n\n{{multiple image\n | align     = centre\n | direction = horizontal\n | header_align = center\n | header    = Buttresses\n | image1    = \n | width1    = 160\n | alt1      =\n | caption1  = \n | image2    =Lincoln, UK - panoramio (30).jpg\n | width2    = 247\n | alt2      =\n | caption2  =  East end of Lincoln Cathedral, with wall buttress, and chapter house with flying buttresses. \n | image3    = Canterbury Cathedral 04.JPG\n | width3    = 245\n | alt3      =\n | caption3  = Wall buttresses and simple flying buttresses behind a parapet at Canterbury Cathedral\n | image4    = Amiens Cath\u00e9drale Notre-dame arc-boutant sud-est 4.jpg\n | width4    = 247\n | alt4      =\n | caption4  = The complex buttresses of Amiens Cathedral support one of the highest Gothic vaults \n | image5    = Arri\u00e8re de la cath\u00e9drale Notre-Dame de Paris en mars 2014.jpg\n | width5    = 274\n | alt5      =\n | caption5  =  The east end of Notre Dame de Paris with flying buttresses supporting the high vault\n }}\n\n==Plan, elevation and parts of a Gothic Cathedral==\n\n===Plan===\n[[File:Cathedral schematic plan en vectorial.svg|thumb|350px|Plan of a Gothic Cathedral]]\nMost large Gothic churches and many smaller parish churches are of the [[Latin cross]] (or \"cruciform\") plan, with a long nave making the body of the church, a transverse arm called the [[transept]] and, beyond it, an extension which may be called the [[Choir (architecture)|choir]], chancel or presbytery. There are several regional variations on this plan. The area where the nave and transept meet is called the crossing, and in England is often surmounted by a stone tower, as at [[Salisbury Cathedral]] and [[York Minster]], visible on a ground-plan by the sturdy piers that support the tower.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}} (see below)\n\nThe nave is generally flanked on either side by aisles, usually single as at York Minster and [[Florence Cathedral]] but sometimes double as at [[bourges Cathedral|Bourges]] and [[Cologne Cathedral]]s.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}} (see plans below). Aisles may extend along the sides of the transepts as well, as at Cologne, [[Amiens Cathedral]] and York Minster.(see plans) In the South of France there is often a single wide nave and no aisles, as at [[Saint-Bertrand-de-Comminges]] and [[Albi Cathedral]]s.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}} \n\nIn some churches with double aisles, or additional rows of chapels between the buttresses as at [[Notre-Dame de Paris]], the transept does not project beyond the aisles (See plan).{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}} In English cathedrals, transepts tend to project boldly and there may be two of them, as at Salisbury and [[Lincoln Cathedral]]s. The double transepts are to provide extra chapels, in lieu of the apsidal chapels found in French cathedrals (See Salisbury plan).{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\nThe eastern arm shows considerable diversity. In France and Germany, the eastern end is generally polygonal and surrounded by a continuation of the choir aisle called an [[ambulatory]]. Surrounding the ambulatory may be a ring of chapels called a \"[[chevet]]\".{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}} In England the eastern arm is generally long and may have two distinct sections- choir and presbytery.

This term, used architecturally, does not have any ecclesiastical or spiritual significance such as is associated with Catholic basilicas that have been designated by the pope as a church of great significance, e.g. the [[Basilica of St Peter]], in Rome, or the [[Rosary Basilica|Basilica of Our Lady of the Rosary]] at Lourdes. (see [[Papal Basilica]] and [[Minor Basilica]]){{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\nArchitecturally, a basilica is a church that has a longitudinal nave, with a lower aisle on each side, separated by rows of columns or piers, and generally with windows let into that part of the nave that rises above the outer roof of the aisles. This upper section is called the [[clerestory]]. This architectural form is so named because it was commonly used by ancient Roman builders as the structure for secular [[Basilica|basilicas]] used as halls for meetings, markets and as places of justice. Early Christian churches such as [[Santa Maria Maggiore]], Rome, and [[San Apollinare in Classe]] have this form, which was adopted by Romanesque builders for their great abbeys and cathedrals, across Europe, such as Durham Cathedral, Saint-Etienne, Caen, and Monreale Cathedral.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\nDuring the Gothic period, most cathedrals were built with a single aisle on each side of the nave, such as Salisbury Cathedral, but some had double aisles with the outer lower than the inner, such as Bourges Cathedral. In the South of France cathedrals are sometimes just a single high, wide hall, with tall windows but no aisles, and the lower stage giving a robust fortified appearance, such as [[Albi Cathedral]]. Gothic churches of the Germanic tradition, like [[Stephansdom (Vienna)|St. Stephen of Vienna]], often have nave and aisles of similar height, without clerestory, and are called ''[[Hall church|Hallenkirche]]''.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\nInternally, the nave and choir are usually divided horizontally into three stages, the arcade, the triforium gallery and the clerestorey.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}} This arrangement is usual in England where it can be seen at Salisbury, Lincoln, and Ely.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}} \n\nIn some French Cathedrals, such as Laon and the nave of Rouen, there is a fourth stage, a shallow tribune gallery between the triforium and the clerestory.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}} In the transepts of Notre-Dame, the wall above the triforium gallery is pierced with rose windows. In later Gothic cathedrals and abbey churches, the vertical members in the tracery of galleries and clerestory may merge into a single decorative unit where the stages are present but not clearly defined, as at Saint-Ouen at Rouen and the choir of Gloucester Cathedral in England. {{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\nIn the Gothic cathedrals and abbey churches of Italy, triforium galleries are most often found in churches influenced by the architecture of Normandy, and were used at abbeys of women, as a space for the nuns to attend services.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}} Elsewhere, many churches such as Florence Cathedral and the Abbey Church of Santa Maria Novella, had an interior elevation of two stages, the arcade and clerestory. {{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\n{{multiple image\n | align     = centre\n | direction = horizontal\n | header_align = center\n | header    = French Gothic elevations\n | image1    = Notre Dame 531 transverse crop rot.jpg\n | width1    = 200\n | alt1      =\n | caption1  = Notre Dame de Paris, showing the nave and double aisles; vault and flying buttresses.\n | image2    =Vue.interieure.travee.cathedrale.Paris.png\n | width2    = 183\n | alt2      =\n | caption2  = Notre Dame de Paris.

These include the octagonal tower at Burgos Cathedral, the wooden octagonal tower at Ely Cathedral and the octagonal dome of Florence Cathedral, conceived in the late Gothic period and engineered by the Renaissance architect, Filippo Brunelleschi.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}} \n\n{{multiple image\n | align     = centre\n | direction = horizontal\n | header_align = center\n | header    = Towers and spires\n\n | image1    = Cathedrale laon facade 2012.jpg\n | width1    = 150\n | alt1      =\n | caption1  = Laon Cathedral- the strongly articulated towers of the west front. \n\n | image2    = Facade cathedral.jpg\n | width2    = 150\n | alt2      =\n | caption2  = Chartres Cathedral- C12th masonry spire, and Flamboyant spire \n\n | image3    = Canterbury-15.jpg\n | width3    = 167\n | alt3      =\n | caption3  = Canterbury Cathedral - the large tower over the crossing \n\n | image4    = Rouen Cathedral as seen from Gros Horloge 140215 4.jpg\n | width4    = 140\n | alt4      =\n | caption4  = Rouen Cathedral- three different towers and a lead-covered fleche\n\n | image5    = Spire Cathedral St Stephen Vienna Wien Steffl 1.jpg\n | width5    = 137\n | alt5      =\n | caption5  = St Stephan's Cathedral, Vienna- openwork stone spire \n\n | image6    = Lichfield Cathedral.jpg\n | width6    = 167\n | alt6      =\n | caption6  = Lichfield Cathedral- three masonry spires, the central being taller. \n\n | image7    = 26-Ely-004.jpg\n | width7    = 167\n | alt7      =\n | caption7  = Ely Cathedral- the wooden octagon rises from an octagonal stone tower\n\n | image8    = Badia Fiorentina from Palazzo Vecchio n01.jpg\n | width8    = 150\n | alt8      =\n | caption8  = Badia Fiorentina, Florence- tall campanile with spire\n }}\n\n===Portals and the tympanum=== \n<!---\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"200\">\nFile:Saint Denis PM 086190 F.jpg|North portal of [[Basilica of St Denis]], with early [[Tympanum (architecture)|tympanum]] and columns made of elongated figures (1135\u20131140)\nFile:Amiens cathedral Tympanumt.JPG|Day of Judgement [[Tympanum (architecture)|tympanum]] at [[Amiens Cathedral]] (1220\u20131270), the prototype for other high Gothic portals.\nFile:Frontispice cath\u00e9drale Strasbourg.JPG|Portals and tympanum of [[Strasbourg Cathedral]] (Begun 1176)\nFile:WestminsterNorth55.jpg|[[Westminster Abbey]] north portal (begun 1245)\n</gallery> --->\n\nEarly Gothic Cathedrals traditionally have their main entrance at the western end of the church, opposite the choir.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}} Based on the model of the [[Basilica of Saint-Denis]] and [[Notre-Dame de Paris]], there are usually three doorways with pointed arches.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}} During the Romanesque period cathedral and abbey portals were enriched by sculpture, and a carved figure often occupied the central jamb of the door.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}} The main pictorial representation occupied the [[Tympanum (architecture)|tympanum]], the panel between the arch and the lintel of the door.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}} The subject was usually the [[Last Judgement]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}} This arrangement continued into the Gothic era.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}} \n\nOne of the earliest portals of the Gothic period was that at Chartres Cathedral, where the three portals of the west front show three different aspects of the [[Life of Christ in art|Life of Christ]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}} At Amiens, the tympanum over the central portal depicted the [[Last Judgement]], the right portal showed the [[Coronation of the Virgin]], and the left portal showed the lives of saints who were important in the diocese.

The increasing height of cathedrals over the Gothic period was accompanied by an increasing proportion of the wall devoted to windows, until, by the late Gothic, the interiors became like cages of glass. This was made possible by the development of the flying buttress, which transferred the thrust of the weight of the roof to the supports outside the walls. As a result, the walls gradually became thinner and higher, and masonry was replaced with glass. The four-part elevation of the naves of early Cathedrals such as Notre-Dame (arcade, tribune, triforium, claire-voie) was transformed in the choir of [[Beauvais Cathedral]] to very tall arcades, a thin triforium, and soaring windows up to the roof.{{sfn|Wenzler|2018|p=108}}\n\nBeauvais Cathedral reached the limit of what was possible with Gothic technology. A portion of the choir collapsed in 1284, causing alarm in all of the cities with very tall cathedrals. Panels of experts were created in Sienna and Chartres to study the stability of those structures.{{Sfn|Martindale|1993|p=86}} Only the transept and choir of Beauvais were completed, and in the 21st century, the transept walls were reinforced with cross-beams. No cathedral built since exceeded the height of the choir of Beauvais.{{Sfn|Wenzler|2018|p=108}}\n\nA section of the main body of a Gothic church usually shows the [[nave]] as considerably taller than it is wide. In England, the proportion is sometimes greater than 2:1, while the greatest proportional difference achieved is at [[Cologne Cathedral]] with a ratio of 3.6:1. The highest internal vault is at Beauvais Cathedral at {{convert|48|m|ft}}.<ref name=BF/> --->\n\n====Vertical emphasis====\nThe pointed arch lends itself to a suggestion of height. This appearance is characteristically further enhanced by both the architectural features and the decoration of the building.<ref name=Swaan/>{{Page needed|date=April 2020}}\n\nOn the exterior, the verticality is emphasised in a major way by the towers and spires and in a lesser way by strongly projecting vertical buttresses, by narrow half-columns called ''attached shafts'' which often pass through several storeys of the building, by long narrow windows, vertical mouldings around doors and figurative sculpture which emphasises the vertical and is often attenuated.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}} The roof-line, gable ends, buttresses and other parts of the building are often terminated by small pinnacles, [[Milan Cathedral]] being an extreme example in the use of this form of decoration.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\nOn the interior of the building attached shafts often sweep unbroken from floor to ceiling and meet the ribs of the vault, like a tall tree spreading into branches. The verticals are generally repeated in the treatment of the windows and wall surfaces. In many Gothic churches, particularly in France, and in the ''Perpendicular period'' of [[English Gothic architecture]], the treatment of vertical elements in gallery and window tracery creates a strongly unifying feature that counteracts the horizontal divisions of the interior structure.<ref name=Swaan/>{{Page needed|date=April 2020}}\n\n{{multiple image\n | align     = centre\n | direction = horizontal\n | header_align = center\n | header    = Vertical elements\n | image1    = Reims - 2013-08-27 - IMG 2265.jpg\n | width1    = 150\n | alt1      =\n | caption1  = West front of Reims Cathedral \n\n | image2    = Cath\u00e9drale Saint-Pierre de Beauvais ext 106.JPG\n | width2    = 167\n | alt2      =\n | caption2  = The exterior of the choir of Beauvais Cathedral \n\n | image3    = Cenral tympanum Chartres.jpg\n | width3    = 150\n | alt3      =\n | caption3  = Figures around the central door of Chartres Cathedral \n | image4    = The Five Sisters - geograph.org.uk - 770345.jpg\n | width4    = 150\n | alt4      =\n | caption4  = The Five Sister windows in the north transept at York Minster\n | image5    = PM 103594 F Bourges.jpg\n | width5    = 150\n | alt5      =\n | caption5  =  A clustered column of the nave at Bourges Cathedral  \n | image6    = Koelner dom nordseite des chors.jpg\n | width6    = 167\n | alt6      = \n | caption6  = Vertical elements in the galleries at Cologne Cathedral \n | image7    =Koelner dom blick nach osten.jpg\n | width7    = 167\n | alt7      =\n | caption7  = The buttresses pinnacles of the choir at Cologne Cathedral \n\n }}\n\n===Light===\nExpansive interior light has been a feature of Gothic cathedrals since the first structure was opened.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}} The metaphysics of light in the Middle Ages led to clerical belief in its divinity and the importance of its display in holy settings. Much of this belief was based on the writings of [[Pseudo-Dionysius]], a sixth-century mystic whose book {{Lang-la|[[De Coelesti Hierarchia]]|label=none}} was popular among monks in France.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}} Pseudo-Dionysius held that all light, even light reflected from metals or streamed through windows, was divine.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}} To promote such faith, the abbot in charge of the Saint-Denis church on the north edge of Paris, the [[Abbot Suger]], encouraged architects remodelling the building to make the interior as bright as possible.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\nEver since the remodelled [[Basilica of Saint-Denis]] opened in 1144, Gothic architecture has featured expansive windows, such as at [[Sainte-Chapelle]], [[York Minster]], [[Gloucester Cathedral]]. The increase in size between windows of the Romanesque and Gothic periods is related to the use of the ribbed vault, and in particular, the pointed ribbed vault which channelled the weight to a supporting shaft with less outward thrust than a semi-circular vault. Walls did not need to be so weighty.<ref name=NP/>{{page needed|date=April 2020}}<ref name=Swaan/>{{page needed|date=April 2020}}\n\nA further development was the flying buttress which arched externally from the springing of the vault across the roof of the aisle to a large buttress pier projecting well beyond the line of the external wall.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}} These piers were often surmounted by a [[pinnacle]] or [[statue]], further adding to the downward weight, and counteracting the outward thrust of the vault and buttress arch as well as stress from wind loading.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\nThe internal columns of the arcade with their attached shafts, the ribs of the vault and the flying buttresses, with their associated vertical buttresses jutting at right-angles to the building, created a stone skeleton. Between these parts, the walls and the infill of the vaults could be of lighter construction. Between the narrow buttresses, the walls could be opened up into large windows.<ref name=BF/>{{page needed|date=April 2020}}\n\nThrough the Gothic period, thanks to the versatility of the pointed arch, the structure of Gothic windows developed from simple openings to immensely rich and decorative sculptural designs.

Nowhere was this more manifest that in the building of cathedrals and the great churches of abbeys, colleges and prosperous towns.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}  \n\nWhile the plan and elevation of the various types of Gothic ecclesiastical architecture remained consistently linked to purpose and to regional preferences, all the other elements developed, generally towards greater complexity, over the decades.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}} The piers, the arcades, the galleries, the vaults and the portals, all evolved. The evolution was largely linked to and dependent upon the structural and ornamental flexibility of the pointed arch.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}} \n\nThis development is traditionally divided into periods or styles according to the system of the 19th century French archaeologist [[Arcisse de Caumont]].<ref>Banister Fletcher, 17th edition, p. 534</ref> The periods are generally called Early Gothic (1137-1180), High Gothic (1180-1230), Rayonnant Gothic (1230-1350 and Flamboyant Gothic (1350-1530). These terms apply to the Gothic architecture of France and to those countries where the influence of French Gothic spread. These styles did not, however, progress at the same rate, or in the same way in every country.\n\nIn England, the reconstruction of Westminster Abbey and the east end of Canterbury Cathedral were both influenced by French Gothic, with the architect at Canterbury being [[William of Sens]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}} Wells Cathedral, however, takes a completely different direction to French Gothic, introducing an unprecedented use of fluted mouldings, and other decorative innovations.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}} Salisbury Cathedral and the nave of Lincoln are also very different to the French prototypes.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}} Hence, the styles of English Gothic are referred to as Early English (or Lancet) Gothic (c. 1180\u20131275), Geometric Decorated and Flamboyant Decorated Gothic, (c. 1275\u20131380); and Perpendicular Gothic, (c. 1380\u20131520), after the system proposed by [[Thomas Rickman]].<ref>Thomas Rickman,  ''Attempt to Discriminate the Style of Architecture in England'' (1812\u201315) {{page needed|date=April 2020}}</ref>{{page needed|date=April 2020}} \n\nOne of the indicators of style is the nature of the windows and doors, and their decorative treatment.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}} This is strongly associated with and affected by the type of arches used within the particular building. \nThe Gothic styles, Lancet, Geometric, Rayonnant, Flamboyant and Perpendicular, affected all the various forms of architectonic decoration within the church - arcading, niches, shrines, wooden panelling, furniture of all sorts, reliquaries, vessels, and vestments.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}   \n\n{{multiple image\n | align     = centre\n | direction = horizontal\n | header_align = center\n | header    = Gothic styles\n | image1    = 0 Soissons - Nef et ch\u0153ur de la cath\u00e9drale Saint-Gervais-et-Saint-Protais (1).JPG\n | width1    = 244\n | alt1      =\n | caption1  = Early Gothic at Soissons Cathedral, France\n | image2    = 06-Lincoln-049.jpg\n | width2    = 220\n | alt2      =\n | caption2  = Geometric Gothic at Lincoln Cathedral, England\n | image3    = Auxerre Cath\u00e9drale St. \u00c9tienne Innen Langhaus West 2.jpg\n | width3    = 240\n | alt3      =\n | caption3  = Rayonnant Gothic at Auxerre Cathedral, France\n | image4    = 68532-Salamanca (49093734597).jpg\n | width4    = 240\n | alt4      =\n | caption4  = Flamboyant Gothic at Salamanca Cathedral, Spain \n | image5    = Gloucester Cathedral High Altar, Gloucestershire, UK - Diliff.jpg\n | width5    = 208\n | alt5      =\n | caption5  = Perpndicular Gothic at Gloucester, England\n }} \n\n\n===Arches, windows and tracery===\n====Early or Lancet Gothic====\nThe simplest shape of a Gothic window is a long opening with a pointed arch known in England as the lancet. Lancet windows may be used singly, as in the nave of Lincoln Cathedral, or grouped, as in the nave of Salisbury Cathedral where they are in two in the aisles and threes in the clerestory. Because large lancet windows, such as those lighting the aisles of a cathedral, may be wide in comparison to a single light in a traceried window, they often have armatures of wood or iron to support the glass. The arch of a lancet opening is often equilateral, but sometimes is much more acute, and when employed in the arcade of a choir apse, such as at Westminster Abbey, adds to the emphasis of height.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}} \n\nThe simple shape of the lancet arch may appear in Early Gothic buildings on openings of all types, doorways, niches, arcades, including galleries; and belfry openings.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}   \n\nThe use of lancet windows is found in the Early Gothic architecture of France, at the Abbey of St Denis, and Sens and [[Senlis Cathedral|Senlis]] cathedrals. At Chartres and Laon cathedrals lancet windows are grouped beneath the rose windows. Tall narrow lancets are also found in radiating groups in the chancel apses of some cathedrals, such as Chartres.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}} It is common in France for lancet windows to be used in smaller, narrower spaces, such as the chapels of a chevet, while traceries windows are used in the clerestory.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}  \n\nThe style Lancet Gothic is known in England as Early English Gothic, with Salisbury Cathedral being the prime example. [[York Minster]] has a group of lancet windows each fifty feet high and still containing ancient glass. They are known as the Five Sisters. <ref name=BF/>{{page needed|date=April 2020}}<ref name=CT/>{{page needed|date=April 2020}} Wells Cathedral is notable for the continuous rows of lancet openings that make up the triforiun galleries. \nLancet windows are used extensively in the Gothic churches of Italy, including Florence Cathedral and in the [[Brick Gothic]] churches of Germany and Poland.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}   \n\n====Geometric Gothic (England)====\nThe Equilateral Arch lends itself to filling with tracery of simple equilateral, circular and semi-circular forms. In France, windows of clerestorys, and other larger windows were commonly divided into two lights, with some simple Geometric tracery above, a circle or a cinquefoil or sexfoil. This style of window remained popular without great change until after 1300.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\nIn England there was a much greater variation in the design of tracery that evolved to fill these spaces. The style is known as Geometric Decorated Gothic and can be seen to splendid effect at many English cathedrals and abbey churches, where both the eastern and the western terminations of the building may be occupied by a single large window such as the east window at Lincoln and the west window at Worcester Cathedral. Windows of complex design and of three or more ''lights'' or vertical sections, are often designed by overlapping two or more equilateral arches springing from the vertical mullions.<ref name=CT/>{{page needed|date=April 2020}} \n\n====Rayonnant Gothic====\n{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2020}}\nRayonnant Gothic is the term used particularly to described the style that produced the great rose windows of France. These windows deck not only the west fronts of cathedrals, but often, as at Notre-Dame de Paris, the transept gables as well. It is common that although the transepts of French Cathedrals do not project strongly, they are given visual importance almost equal to the west front, including large decorated portals and a rose window. Particularly fine examples are at Notre-Dame and Chartres Cathedral.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}} \n\n====Flamboyant Gothic====\nThe [[Flamboyant]] Arch is one that is drafted from four points, the upper part of each main arc turning upwards into a smaller arc and meeting at a sharp, flame-like point.{{Dubious|date=April 2020}} These arches create a rich and lively effect when used for window tracery and surface decoration. The form is structurally weak and has very rarely been used for large openings except when contained within a larger and more stable arch. It is not employed at all for [[Vault (architecture)|vaulting]].<ref name=BF/>{{page needed|date=April 2020}}\n\nSome of the most beautiful and famous traceried windows of Europe employ this type of tracery. It can be seen at [[St Stephen's Vienna]], [[Sainte-Chapelle]] in Paris, at the Cathedrals of [[Cath\u00e9drale Saint-\u00c9tienne de Limoges|Limoges]] and [[Rouen Cathedral|Rouen]] in France. In England the most famous examples are the West Window of [[York Minster]] with its design based on the [[Sacred Heart]], the extraordinarily rich nine-light East Window at [[Carlisle Cathedral]] and the exquisite East window of [[Selby Abbey]].<ref name=CT/>{{page needed|date=April 2020}}<ref name=NP/>{{page needed|date=April 2020}}\n\nDoorways surmounted by Flamboyant mouldings are very common in both ecclesiastical and domestic architecture in France.

A notable example is the doorway to the Chapter Room at [[Rochester Cathedral]].<ref name=BF/>{{page needed|date=April 2020}}<ref name=CT/>{{page needed|date=April 2020}}\n\nThe style was much used in England for wall arcading and niches. Prime examples in are in the Lady Chapel at [[Ely Cathedral|Ely]], the Screen at [[Lincoln Cathedral|Lincoln]] and externally on the fa\u00e7ade of [[Exeter Cathedral]]. In German and Spanish Gothic architecture it often appears as openwork screens on the exterior of buildings. The style was used to rich and sometimes extraordinary effect in both these countries, notably on the famous pulpit in [[Vienna Cathedral]].<ref name=\"JH1\">John Harvey, ''The Gothic World''</ref>{{page needed|date=April 2020}} \n\n====Perpendicular Gothic (England)====\nThe depressed or [[four-centred arch]] is much wider than its height and gives the visual effect of having been flattened under pressure. Its structure is achieved by drafting two arcs which rise steeply from each springing point on a small [[radius]] and then turn into two arches with a wide radius and much lower springing point.<ref name=BF/>{{page needed|date=April 2020}}\n\nThis type of arch, when employed as a window opening, lends itself to very wide spaces, provided it is adequately supported by many narrow vertical shafts. These are often further braced by horizontal transoms. The overall effect produces a grid-like appearance of regular, delicate, rectangular forms with an emphasis on the perpendicular. It is also employed as a wall decoration in which arcade and window openings form part of the whole decorative surface.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\nThe style, known as [[Perpendicular Period|Perpendicular]], that evolved from this treatment is specific to England, although very similar to contemporary Spanish style in particular, and was employed to great effect through the 15th century and first half of the 16th as Renaissance styles were much slower to arrive in England than in Italy and France.<ref name=BF/>{{page needed|date=April 2020}}\n\nIt can be seen notably at the East End of [[Gloucester Cathedral]] where the East Window is said to be as large as a tennis court.

Columns of this type were used at the Abbey of Saint-Denis, at Sens, at Notre-Dame and at Canterbury in England. In buildings with sexpartite vaults, they sometimes alternated with piers.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}} \n\nIn the [[Brabantine Gothic architecture]] of the Holland and Belgium, columns remained part of the style into the 15th century, and have capitals of cabbage leaf foliage.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}} \n\nIn France, the column developed in complexity by having a cluster of circular shafts grouped around the central circular core. This is seen a Reims, Amiens and Bourges Cathedrals, and also at Westminster Abbey and Salisbury Cathedral and in Spain at Burgos Cathedral.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}} \n\nThe rectangular piers also developed, with attached shafts and mouldings which continue up the wall to support the vault, or into the decorative mouldings of the chancel arch, in a manner that had previously been utilised to decorate the arches of Romanesque portals. The eastern end of the Abbey of Saint-Etienne, Caen, was rebuilt from 1166, with clustered piers. From 1176, Wells Cathedral was constructed with clustered piers throughout. Between the two buildings there is a great difference in the handling of the two. At Caen, the pier remains a decorated rectangular pier, set parallel to the wall surface. The shafts themselves maintain a circular, and classicising form. At Well, the core of the pier appears to have been rotated, and become a lozenge, angle-on to the lie of the arcade. The clusters of shafts are fluting. The capitals are of what is know as \"stiff-leaf\" foliage, and has a vitality of form different to any other foliage carving of that date.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}} \n\nComplex clustered columns and fluted and shafted piers were subsequently widely adopted, and became part of the vertical visual character of Gothic cathedrals.\n\n{{multiple image\n | align     = centre\n | direction = horizontal\n | header_align = center\n | header    = Columns and piers\n | image1    = Vue du choeur de la cath\u00e9drale.JPG\n | width1    = 197\n | alt1      =\n | caption1  = Corinthian columns in the choir at Rouen Cathedral\n | image2    = PM 103631 F Bourges.jpg\n | width2    = 175\n | alt2      =\n | caption2  = Tall columns with clusters of shafts, Bourges Cathedral \n | image3    = Salisbury 9978.jpg \n | width3    = 175\n | alt3      =\n | caption3  =  Columns in the nave of Salisbury Cathedral\n | image4    =  Wells Cathedral (St. Andrew) (16466400434).jpg\n | width4    = 175\n | alt4      =\n | caption4  = Fluted piers with Stiff Leaf capitals at Wells Cathedral\n | image5    = Seville Cathedral (6931811902).jpg\n | width5    = 175\n | alt5      =\n | caption5  = Very tall fluted piers at [[Seville Cathedral]], Spain\n  }}\n\n===Developments in ribbed vaulting===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2020}}In France the vaults over the high spaces of nave and clerestory, in the Early Gothic period, was sexpartite, spanning two bays of the nave. This resulted in the vaulted space being almost square, and to diagoal ribs being semi-circular. Only the arches of the transverse ribs were pointed. This is the case at Sens, at Notre-Dame de Paris and the Nave of Laon Cathedral.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}} \n\nAt Chartres Cathedral, and the choir of Laon Cathedral, however, the vault is in four parts, spans a single bay, is rectangular, and all the ribs are pointed. The quadripartite proved much easier to build because it required less centring. It is also stronger as the compartments are smaller. The quadripartite vault is used in the Early English cathedrals of Salisbury and Wells. It became the standard form of vault which leant itself to further development and elaboration.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}} \n\nIn the nave of Lincoln Cathedral the vault acquired extra ribs known as \"tiercerons\" which meet at a central \"ridge rib\" running the length of the nave. An additional elaboration, to span the wide nave, was the introduction of intermediate ribs which do not reach the centre of the vault, but join two small \"lierne\" ribs projecting from the ridge. Other cathedrals with tierceron vaulting are Norwich, and Exeter.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}} \n\nLierne ribs became a feature of later Gothic design, as at [[Bristol Cathedral]] and led the way to elaborate patterns within the vault, including net or \"reticular\" vaulting and \"stellar\" vaulting. Stellar vaulting was particularly fashionable in Germany, Eastern Europe and Spain. The use of short ribs lent itself to the introduction of curved and ogee shaped ribs, in the Flamboyant style. Flamboynt vaulting is particularly prevalent in Spain.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}   \n\nIn England there are a number of chapter house, notably at Wells, Lincoln and Westminster abbey, where the vault is supported by a single central column from which many ribs radiate in every direction like a palm tree. This also occurs at the high vault behind the altar at [[Jacobins Church]], Toulouse, in France.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}} \n\nA further development was many shallow ribs radiating in a fan shape, so that visually, the appearance of the structural ribs is minimised, and the emphasis is upon the curving surfaces. These fan vaults were used successfully for narrower and lower structures such as the cloister at Gloucester Cathedral and the retrochoir at Peterborough, before being employed on the high vaults at the Chapel of Kings College Cambridge, and even even more elaborate form with pendant lanterns attached, at Henry VII's Chapel at Westminster Abbey.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}} \n\n{{multiple image\n| align = centre\n| direction = horizontal\n| header_align = center\n| header = Style- Ribbed vaults\n| image1 = B\u00f3veda de catedral de Notre Dame de Par\u00eds 3.jpg\n| width1 = 144\n| alt1 = \n| caption1 = Notre-Dame, Paris - square, sexpartite vaults spanning two nave bays\n| image2 = Salisbury Cathedral Interior 01.jpg\n| width2 = 162\n| alt2 = \n| caption2 = Salisbury Cathedral, England - rectangular quadripartite vault over single bay\n| image3 = Lincoln cathedral 13 Nave vault.jpg\n| width3 = 162\n| alt3 = \n| caption3 = Lincoln Cathedral, England - quadripartite form, with tierceron ribs and ridge rib with carved bosses.\n| image4 = \n| width4 = 155\n| alt4 = \n| caption4 = \n| image5 = Bremer Dom Juli 2009 PD 060.JPG\n| width5 = 144\n| alt5 = \n| caption5 = Bremen Cathedral, Germany - north aisle, a reticular (net) vault with intersecting ribs.\n| image6 = Wolfsberg Sankt Marein Pfarrkirche Mariae Himmelfahrt Netzrippengewoelbe 03092014 742.jpg\n| width6 = 144\n| alt6 = \n| caption6 = St Marien's, Wolfsberg, Austria - stellar vault with intersecting lierne ribs.\n| image7 = B\u00f3vedas catedral Salamanca 40.jpg\n| width7 = 162\n| alt7 = \n| caption7 = Salamanca Cathedral, Spain - vault has Flamboyant S-shaped and circular lierne ribs,\n| image8 = Peterborough Retrochoir fan vaulting.JPG\n| width8 = 160\n| alt8 = \n| caption8 = Peterborough Cathedral retrochoir - fan vaulting, which further evolved into pendant vaulting.\n| total_width = \n}}\n\n<!---\n===Early Gothic architectural elements, 1137-1180 ===  \n\nThese elements are those to be found in the earliest Gothic buildings of France, Abbey, of St Denis, Sens Cathedral, Senlis Cathedral, Noyon Cathedral, and also affected the rebuilding of the choir at Canterbury in Kent, England, after a fire in 1174. \n\n* Pointed arches, often of equilateral projection \n* Continued use of semi-circular arches in conjunction with pointed arches e.g. in vaulting ribs \n* Ribbed vaulting\n* Nave vault sexpartite, spanning two bays \n* Quadripartite ailse vaults, trapezoid where necessary\n* Cylindrical columns, with simplified Corinthian capitals;

Historians including [[Eug\u00e8ne Viollet-le-Duc|Viollet-le-Duc]], Focillon, Aubert, and [[Max Dvo\u0159\u00e1k]] contended that this is one of the most universal features of the Gothic style.{{sfn|Grodecki|1977|p=20}}\n\nReligious teachings in the Middle Ages, particularly the writings of [[Pseudo-Dionysius]], a 6th-century mystic whose book, ''[[De Coelesti Hierarchia]]'', was popular among monks in France, taught that all light was divine.<ref>Mignon, Olivier, ''Architecture des Cath\u00e9rals Gothiques'' (2015), p. 9 </ref>} When the Abbot [[Suger]] ordered the reconstruction of choir of the [[Basilica of Saint-Denis]],  he had the builders create seventy windows, admitting sa much light as possible, as the means by which the faithful could be elevated from the material world to the immaterial world. <ref>Mignon, Olivier, ''Architecture des Cath\u00e9drales Gothiques'' (2015), p. 9 </ref>\n\nMany earlier Romanesque churches had stained glass windows, and many had round windows, called ''oculi'', but these windows were necessarily small, due to the thickness of the walls. The primary interior decorations of Romanesque cathedrals were painted murals. In the Gothic period, the improvements in rib vaults and flying buttresses allowed cathedral walls to be higher, thinner and stronger, and windows were consequently considerably larger, The windows of churches in the late Gothic period, such as [[Sainte-Chapelle]] in Paris, filled the entire wall between the ribs of stone. Enormous windows were also an important element of [[York Minster]] and [[Gloucester Cathedral]].<ref name=Swaan/>{{page needed|date=April 2020}}\n\nThe main threat to cathedral windows was the wind; frames had to be extremely strong. The early windows were fit into openings cut into the stone. The small pieces of glass were coloured, and then had the color fixed by baking in an oven.  Details such as faces were painted when the glass was cold.  The pieces were joined together within lead frames into panels, which were then combined in larger and stronger lead frames.  Then the finished window was set into the stone opening.   Thin vertical and horizontal bars of iron, called ''vergettes'' or ''barlotierres'', were placed inside the window to reinforce the glass against the wind. <ref>Mignon, Olivier, ''Architecture des Cath\u00e9drales Gothiques'' (2015), p. 22 </ref>\n\nThe stories told in the glass were usually episodes from the [[Bible]], but they also sometimes illustrated the professions of the guilds which had funded the windows, such as the drapers, stonemasons or the barrel-makers.{{sfn|Wenzler|2018|p=28}}\n\nMuch of the stained glass in Gothic cathedrals today dates from later restorations, but a few cathedrals, notably [[Chartres Cathedral]] and [[Bourges Cathedral]], still have many of their original windows.{{sfn|Wenzler|2018|p=28}}\n\n===Sculpture and decoration===\n\nThe exteriors and interiors of Gothic cathedrals, particularly in France, were lavishly ornamented with sculpture and decoration on religious themes, designed for the great majority of parishioners who could not read.

The main portals at [[Notre-Dame de Paris]], for instance, represented the entrance to paradise, with the [[Last Judgement]] depicted on the [[tympanum (architecture)|tympanum]] over the doors, showing Christ surrounded by the apostles, and by the signs of the zodiac, representing the movements of the heavens. The columns below the tympanum are in the form of statues of saints, literally reprinting them as \"the pillars of the church.\"{{sfn|McNamara|2017|pp=158\u201359}} Each saint had his own symbol: a winged lion stood for [[Saint Mark]], an eagle with four wings meant [[Saint John the Apostle]], and a winged bull symbolized [[Saint Luke]]. Sculpted angels had specific functions, sometimes as heralds, blowing trumpets, or holding up columns, as guardian angels; or holding crowns of thorns or crosses, as symbols of the crucifixion of Christ, or waving a container with incense, to illustrate their function at the throne of God. Floral and vegetal decoration was also very common, representing the [[Garden of Eden]]; grapes represented the wines of [[Eucharist]].{{sfn|McNamara|2017|pp=158\u201359}}\n\nThe [[tympanum (architecture)|tympanum]] over the central portal on the west facade of Notre-Dame de Paris vividly illustrates the Last Judgement, with figures of sinners being led off to hell, and good Christians taken to heaven. The sculpture of the right portal shows the coronation of the [[Virgin Mary]], and the left portal shows the lives of saints who were important to Parisians, particularly [[Saint Anne]], the mother of the Virgin Mary.{{sfn|Renault|Laz\u00e9|2006|p=35}}\n\nThe exteriors of cathedrals and other Gothic churches were also decorated with sculptures of a variety of fabulous and frightening [[Grotesque (architecture)|grotesques]] or monsters. These included the [[chimera (mythology)|chimera]], a mythical hybrid creature which usually had the body of a lion and the head of a goat, and the [[Strix (mythology)|strix]] or stryge, a creature resembling an [[owl]] or [[bat]], which was said to eat human flesh.

They were the rain spouts of the cathedral, designed to divide the torrent of water which poured from the roof after rain, and to project it outwards as far as possible from the buttresses and the walls and windows so that it would not erode the mortar binding the stone. To produce many thin streams rather than a torrent of water, a large number of gargoyles were used, so they were also designed to be a decorative element of the architecture. The rainwater ran from the roof into lead gutters, then down channels on the flying buttresses, then along a channel cut in the back of the gargoyle and out of the mouth away from the cathedral.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>{{page needed|date=April 2020}}\n\nMany of the statues, particularly the grotesques, were removed from the facade in the 17th and 18th century, or were destroyed during the [[French Revolution]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}} They were replaced with figures in the Gothic style, designed by [[Eugene Viollet-le-Duc]] during the 19th-century restoration.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}} Similar figures appear on the other Gothic cathedrals of France.\n\nAnother common feature of Gothic cathedrals in France was a [[labyrinth]] or maze on the floor of the nave near the choir, which symbolized the difficult and often complicated journey of a Christian life before attaining paradise. Most labyrinths were removed by the 18th century, but a few, like the one at [[Amiens Cathedral]], have been reconstructed, and the labyrinth at [[Chartres Cathedral]] still exists essentially in its original form.{{sfn|Wenzler|2018|pp=99\u2013100}}\n\n==Synagogues==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2020}}<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"175\">\nFile:Blick von der Gartenseite der Synagoge Worms.jpg|Romanesque [[Worms Synagogue]] from the 11th century with Gothic windows (after 1355)\nFile:Scolanova Synagogue.jpg|[[Scolanova Synagogue]], [[Trani]] (1247)\nFile:20190204 OldSynagoga 3715 (33586950518).jpg|[[Old New Synagogue]], [[Prague]] (c. 1270)\nFile:Altneusynagoge - Portal.jpg|Main portal of the Old New Synagogue, Prague (c. 1270)\nFile:Erfurt Alte Synagoge 688.jpg|[[Old Synagogue (Erfurt)|Old Synagogue]], [[Erfurt]] (c. 1270)\nFile:Praha Pinkas Synagogue Interior 02.jpg|Late Gothic vaulting of [[Pinkas Synagogue]], Prague (1535)\nFile:Krakow Old Synagogue G21.jpg|Renaissance interior of the [[Old Synagogue in Krakow|Old Synagogue]] in [[Krak\u00f3w|Cracow]] using Gothic vaults (1570)\n</gallery>\n\nAlthough Christianity played a dominant role in the Gothic sacred architecture, Jewish communities were present in many European cities during the Middle Ages and they also built their [[Synagogue|houses of prayer]] in the Gothic style.

The new fortifications were more geometric, usually square, with a high main ''donjon'' or tower, in the centre, which could be defended even if the walls of the castle were captured. The Donjon of the [[Chateau de Vincennes]], begun by [[Philip VI of France]], was a good example. It was 52 meters high, the tallest military tower in Europe.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\nIn the Phillipienne castle other towers, usually round were placed at the corners and along the walls, close enough together to support each other. The walls had two levels of walkways on the inside, an upper parapet with openings (''cr\u00e9neaux'') from which soldiers could watch or fire arrows on besiegers below; narrow openings (''[[merlon]]s'') through which they could be sheltered as they fired arrows; and floor openings (''[[Machicolation|m\u00e2chicoulis]]''), from which they could drop rocks, burning oil or other objects on the besiegers. The upper walls also had protected protruding balconies, ''[[Bartizan|\u00e9chauguettes]]'' and ''[[bret\u00e8che]]s'', from which soldiers could see what was happening at the corners or on the ground below. In addition, the towers and walls were pierced with narrow vertical slits, called ''[[Arrowslit|meurtri\u00e8res]]'', through which archers could fire arrows. In later castles the slits took the form of crosses, so that archers could fire ''arbal\u00e8tes'', or [[crossbows]], in different directions.{{sfn|Ducher|1988|pp=66\u201367}}\n\nCastles were surrounded by a deep moat, spanned by a single drawbridge. The entrance was also protected by a grill of iron which could be opened and closed. The walls at the bottom were often sloping, and protected with earthen barriers.

They remained as symbols of the rank of their noble occupants; the narrowing openings in the walls were often widened into the windows of bedchambers and ceremonial halls.

The largest new church, [[Saint-Eustache, Paris|Saint-Eustache]] (1532\u20131560), rivalled Notre-Dame in size, 105 meters long, 44 meters wide, and 35 meters high.

The term \"Gothic\" was first used as a [[pejorative]] description.

The appeal of this [[Gothic revival]] (which after 1837, in Britain, is sometimes termed [[Victorian Gothic]]), gradually widened to encompass \"low church\" as well as \"high church\" clients. This period of more universal appeal, spanning 1855\u20131885, is known in Britain as [[High Victorian Gothic]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\nThe [[Palace of Westminster|Houses of Parliament]] in London by Sir [[Charles Barry]] with interiors by a major exponent of the early Gothic Revival, [[Augustus Welby Pugin]], is an example of the Gothic revival style from its earlier period in the second quarter of the 19th century. Examples from the ''High Victorian Gothic'' period include [[George Gilbert Scott]]'s design for the [[Albert Memorial]] in London, and [[William Butterfield]]'s chapel at [[Keble College, Oxford]]. From the second half of the 19th century onwards, it became more common in Britain for neo-Gothic to be used in the design of non-ecclesiastical and non-governmental buildings types. Gothic details even began to appear in working-class housing schemes subsidised by philanthropy, though given the expense, less frequently than in the design of upper and middle-class housing.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\nThe middle of the 19th century was a period marked by the restoration, and in some cases modification, of ancient monuments and the construction of neo-Gothic edifices such as the nave of [[Cologne Cathedral]] and the [[Sainte-Clotilde, Paris|Sainte-Clotilde]] of [[Paris]] as speculation of mediaeval architecture turned to technical consideration.

The plan of the Gothic cathedral was based upon the plan of the ancient Roman [[basilica]], which was adopted by Romanesque architecture. The [[Latin cross]] form, with a [[nave]] and transept, choir, disambulatory, and radiating chapels, came from the Romanesque model. The grand arcades of columns separating the central vessel of the [[nave]] from the collateral aisles, the [[triforium]] over the grand arcades, and the windows high on the walls allowing light into the nave were all also adapted from the Romanesque model. The portal with a [[tympanum (architecture)|tympanum]] filled with sculpture was another characteristic Romanesque feature, as was the use of the buttress to support the walls from the outside. Gothic architects improved them by adding the [[flying buttress]] with high arches connecting the buttresses to the upper walls. In the interior, Romanesque architecture used the [[barrel vault]] with a round arch to cover the nave, and a [[groin vault]] when two barrel vaults met at right angles. These vaults were the immediate ancestors of the Gothic rib vault. The first use of the Gothic rib vaults to cover a nave was in the Romanesque [[Durham Cathedral]], (1093\u20131104).<ref name=\"auto\">Weber, Patrick, ''Histoire de l'Architecture'' (2018), pp. 35-37</ref>\n\n[[Norman Architecture]], similar to the Romanesque style, also influenced the Gothic style. Early examples are found in [[Lessay Abbey]] in Normandy, which also featured early rib vaults in the nave similar to the Gothic vaults. [[Cefalu Cathedral]] (1131\u20131267) in Sicily, built when Sicily was under Norman rule, is another interesting example. It featured pointed arches and large Romanesque vaults combined with ornamental mosaic decoration.<ref name=\"auto\"/>\n\nRomanesque architecture had become a pan-European style and manner of construction, affecting buildings in countries as far apart as [[Ireland]] and [[Croatia]], and [[Sweden]] and [[Sicily]]. The same wide geographic area was then affected by the development of Gothic architecture, but the acceptance of the Gothic style and methods of construction differed from place to place, as did the expressions of Gothic taste. The proximity of some regions meant that modern country borders did not define divisions of style. Many different factors like geographical/geological, economic, social, or political situations caused the regional differences in the great abbey churches and cathedrals of the Romanesque period that would often become even more apparent in the Gothic. For example, studies of the population statistics reveals disparities such as the multitude of churches, abbeys, and cathedrals in northern [[France]] while in more urbanised regions construction activity of a similar scale was reserved to a few important cities. Such an example comes from Roberto L\u00f3pez, wherein the French city of [[Amiens]] was able to fund its architectural projects whereas [[Cologne]] could not because of the economic inequality of the two.{{sfn|Grodecki|1977|p=25-26}} This wealth, concentrated in rich monasteries and noble families, would eventually spread certain Italian, Catalan, and Hanseatic bankers.{{sfn|Grodecki|1977|p=25}} This would be amended when the economic hardships of the 13th century were no longer felt, allowing [[Normandy]], [[Tuscany]], [[Flanders]], and the southern [[Rhineland]] to enter into competition with France.{{sfn|Grodecki|1977|p=26}} \n\n===Islamic and Armenian influence===\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"200\">\nAl-Ukhaidir Fortess.jpg|[[Al-Ukhaidir Fortress]] (completed 775 AD), Iraq\nJerusalem-2013-Al-Aqsa Mosque 04.jpg|[[Al-Aqsa Mosque]], Jerusalem\nCordoba, la Mezquita - C\u00fapula de la Maqsura.jpg|Vaulted central dome of [[Cordoba Cathedral|Cordoba Mosque-Cathedral]], Spain (784\u2013987 A.D.).

The earliest written references to Whitwell are from the Anglo-Saxon charters. However, many of its historical sites predate this period. Within the parish are several [[Iron Age]] burial mounds, an Iron Age fort and settlement, the remains of a Roman villa, medieval field systems, and both a Norman and Saxon church, the world heritage site of [[Creswell Crags]] was until recently within the parish. [[Whitwell Old Hall]] is a medieval manor house.\n\nWhitwell won the 'Best Kept Village in Derbyshire' Award in 1988.\n\nWhitwell is a thriving village with strong community spirit. The village has many active clubs and societies, including Whitwell Scout and Guide Group, Local History Group, Whitwell Players, Whitwell Brass Band and junior band, C of E, Methodist and Poplar churches, Natural History Group, green bowls club, cricket club, and football club.\n\nAlthough being quite a small village, Whitwell has six public houses.  It previously had as many as 11 and held the record for most number of licensed premises per capita. The current pubs are Holmefield Arms, The Jack Ups (Whitwell Working Men's Club), New Middle Club, The Boot And Shoe, The Half Moon and The Royal Oak. The biggest employer just outside the village is La Farge Works (formerly Steetley Company), which run a quarry which supplies limestone and other products all around the world.\n\n[[Image:Whitwell, Derbyshire View.jpg|thumb|right|200px|View over Whitwell]]\n\n==Whitwell Wood==\nWhitwell Wood is a large area of ancient woodland covering approximately 171 hectares. It forms part of the Welbeck Estate, one of the former medieval dukeries of Nottinghamshire. The wood is managed on a long term lease by the Forestry Commission. It is a predominantly broad-leaved wood with over 20 species indicating ancient woodland, a number of interesting archaeological features and a freshwater spring known as the Ginny Spring. The spring is designated as a site of special scientific interest (SSSI). This designation is partly due to the varied flora, but also because of a number of species that are rare in the region. As such, the wood has a very high nature conservation status. A [[Three Shire Oak]] once stood in a field adjacent to Whitwell Wood. The oak traditionally marked the meeting point of the borders of Derbyshire, Nottinghamshire and Yorkshire. However, the tree actually stood some distance to the south of the actual border, which is located closer to the Nottinghamshire village of [[Shireoaks]].\nOnly Whitwell, Elmton & Thorp (Salvin) were the original Saxon towns. Before Creswell Village was built around the colliery in the late 19th century, Creswell Crags was known on local farms  as Whitwell Crags. This may be what was referred to when King Alfred's grandson, King Edmund conquered the 5 Boroughs from the Viking Earls, the Saxon poets record him reaching as far as Dore & Hwitan Wylles Geat' (the Whitwell Gap).\n\n==Famous Whitwellians==\nOne of Whitwell's most famous sons was [[Joe Davis]], world snooker and billiards champion from the 1920s to the 1940s. His Whitwell home (on Welbeck Street) bears a plaque commemorating him.\n\n[[Les Jackson (cricketer)|Les Jackson]], [[English cricket team|England]] cricketer and [[Wisden Cricketer of the Year]]<ref>[https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Players/0/859/859.html Les Jackson at CricketArchive.com]</ref> in 1959, played for Whitwell Cricket Club and came to watch their games on a Saturday afternoon until his death in 2007.\n\nAlso from the village are [[Chris Adams (cricketer)|Chris Adams]], the [[Sussex County Cricket Club|Sussex]] and [[English cricket team|England]] cricketer and [[Ian Bennett (footballer)|Ian Bennett]], a professional goalkeeper who currently plays for [[Huddersfield Town]], whose family still lives in the village.\n\nCelebrated Great War poet, William Streets was also from the village.\n\nThe village is the birthplace and childhood home of [[J.

Due to the changing political climate in Russia at the time, the matches were often depicted as a clash of ideologies, between \"new Russia\" represented by Kasparov and [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] and \"old Russia\" represented by Karpov and [[Communist]]s such as [[Leonid Brezhnev]].<ref>{{cite news\n|title = Time Magazine, March 2007\n|url = http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1604889,00.html\n|accessdate = 1 November 2009\n| date=29 March 2007}}</ref>\n\n===The players===\nAt the time of the match, Karpov had a [[ELO rating system#FIDE ratings|FIDE rating]] of 2720, while Kasparov was close behind with a rating of 2700. There was a large difference in age between the two players, with Karpov (34) the older by 12 years.\n\nBetween the end of the 1984 match and the start of the 1985 match, Kasparov played matches against [[Robert H\u00fcbner]] in Germany, winning three games and [[draw (chess)|drawing]] three, and against [[Ulf Andersson]] in Sweden, winning two games and drawing four.<ref name=\"MW\">{{cite web\n|title = World Chess Championship 1985\n|author = Mark Weeks\n|url = http://www.mark-weeks.com/chess/85kk$$.htm\n|accessdate = 1 November 2009}}</ref>\n\nKarpov also showed that he was still in good form when he won the 1985 OHRA tournament in [[Amsterdam]] with 7/10, not losing a game<ref>{{cite web\n|title = Review of ''Garry Kasparov on Modern Chess''\n|url = http://marshtowers.blogspot.com/2008/09/chess-reviews-60.html\n|accessdate = 1 November 2009}}</ref>\nand winning four.<ref>{{cite web\n|title = Amsterdam OHRA 1985\n|url = http://www.chessgames.com/perl/chesscollection?cid=1017612\n|accessdate = 25 September 2016}}</ref>\n\nAs in previous World Chess Championships, each of the contestants employed other chess players as \"seconds\" to help with preparation and analysis of [[Adjournment (games)#Chess|adjourned]] games.

Due to the extreme duration of the previous match, [[FIDE]] agreed at a meeting in [[Tunisia]] in July 1985 that the re-arranged championship would be of fixed length, played as the best of 24 games.

After Tintin takes the model home to his apartment, it is accidentally broken during a chase between Snowy and a cat; a parchment scroll slips out of the ship and rolls under a piece of Tintin's furniture. Meanwhile, bumbling police detectives [[Thomson and Thompson]] are on the trail of [[pickpocket]] [[Aristides Silk]].\n\nAfter visiting Maritime Library to uncover the history surrounding the Unicorn, Tintin returns to find the ''Unicorn'' has been stolen, which he suspects Sakharine of doing. He heads to [[Marlinspike Hall]], where he accuses him of the theft, but noticing Sakharine's model is not broken, he realizes there are two ''Unicorn'' models. Tintin returns to his apartment, which has been ransacked, and is shown the scroll by Snowy. However, they are interrupted by the arrival of Barnaby, who is then assassinated while attempting to recover the ''Unicorn''.\n\nTintin places the scroll in his wallet, but is pick-pocketed by Silk the next morning and soon afterwards abducted by accomplices of Sakharine on the SS ''Karaboudjan''. He learns that Sakharine formed an alliance with the ship's staff and led a [[mutiny]] to take control. On board, Tintin encounters the ship's captain, [[Captain Haddock|Archibald Haddock]], who is permanently drunk and has forgotten most of his past. Tintin, Haddock and Snowy outrun the crew and escape from the ''Karaboudjan'' in a lifeboat. The ship attempts to ram their boat but instead ram an empty lifeboat Haddock accidentally released during his escape. Noticing that two lifeboats have been released, Sakharine presumes them to have survived and sends a [[seaplane]] to find and capture them. Feeling cold and thirsty on the lifeboat ride, Haddock foolishly uses a stowaway bottle of [[scotch whisky]] to put out a fire he started in the boat, causing an explosion that leaves the trio stranded on top of the upturned boat. The trio seize the seaplane and use it to fly towards the fictitious [[Morocco|Moroccan]] port of [[Settings in The Adventures of Tintin|Bagghar]], but it crashes in a desert due to low fuel and a thunderstorm.\n\nWhile trekking through the desert along with Tintin and Snowy, Haddock hallucinates and remembers his ancestor, [[Sir Francis Haddock]], the 17th-century captain of the ''Unicorn'', whose treasure-laden ship was attacked by the crew of a [[Piracy|pirate ship]] led by [[Red Rackham]], who is later revealed to be Sakharine's ancestor. Sir Francis surrendered, but since the pirates killed all of his crew, he chose to sink the ''Unicorn'', along with most of its treasure, to prevent it from falling into Rackham's hands. The story implies there were three ''Unicorn'' models, each containing a scroll; together, the scrolls can reveal coordinates of the location of the sunken ''Unicorn'' and its treasure.\n\nThe third model is in Bagghar, possessed by [[Omar ben Salaad]]. Sakharine causes a distraction in a [[Bianca Castafiore]] concert,which results in him stealing the third scroll. A chase through the city ensues, during which he gains all the scrolls. Just as he is ready to give up, Tintin is persuaded by Haddock to continue. With help from Thomson and Thompson, Tintin and Haddock track Sakharine back to Brussels and set up a trap, but Sakharine uses his pistol to resist arrest. When his men fail to save him, Sakharine challenges Haddock to a sword fight with the cranes at the dock. After the fight, Sakharine is pushed overboard by Haddock; he is then rescued and arrested by Thomson and Thompson.\n\nGuided by the three scrolls, which indicate the location of Marlinspike Hall, Tintin, Haddock and Snowy travel there. Inside, aided by Haddock, they find some of the treasure and a clue to the ''Unicorn''{{'}}s location; Tintin and Haddock both agree on setting up an expedition to find [[Red Rackham's Treasure]].\n\n==Voice cast==\n* [[Jamie Bell]] as [[Tintin (character)|Tintin]].<ref name=\"pr\">{{cite news |title=Paramount Pictures and Sony Pictures Entertainment Announce the January&nbsp;26 Start of Principal Photography on the 3D Motion Capture Feature 'The Adventures of Tintin: Secret of the Unicorn' Directed by Steven Spielberg and Starring Jamie Bell and Daniel Craig |publisher=[[PR Newswire]] |url=http://news.prnewswire.com/ViewContent.aspx?ACCT=109&STORY=/www/story/01-26-2009/0004960578&EDATE= |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090201055406/http://news.prnewswire.com/ViewContent.aspx?ACCT=109&STORY=%2Fwww%2Fstory%2F01-26-2009%2F0004960578&EDATE= |url-status=dead |archive-date=1 February 2009 |accessdate=26 January 2009 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> Bell replaced [[Thomas Brodie-Sangster]], who dropped out when filming was delayed in October 2008.<ref name=\"delay\" /> Jackson suggested Bell to take on the role after previously casting him as Jimmy in his ''[[King Kong (2005 film)|King Kong]]'' remake.<ref name=\"dig\" />\n* [[Andy Serkis]] as [[Captain Archibald Haddock]] and [[Sir Francis Haddock]].<ref name=\"interpol\">{{cite news|author=Jay A.

The composer decided to employ various musical styles, with \"1920s, 1930s European jazz\" for the opening credits and \"pirate music\" for the battle at sea.<ref>\"Tintin: The Score\", ''The Adventures of Tintin'' DVD</ref> The score was released on 21 October 2011 by [[Sony Classical Records]].<ref>{{cite web|title=The Adventures Of Tintin: John Williams|url=https://www.amazon.fr/The-Adventures-Of-Tintin/dp/B005VTVLOO|publisher=Amazon.fr|accessdate=30 January 2012|date=21 October 2011}}</ref>\n\n;Track listing\n{{Track listing\n| all_music    = [[John Williams]]\n| total_length = {{duration|m=65|s=22}}\n| title1       = The Adventures of Tintin\n| length1      = 3:07\n| title2       = Snowy's Theme\n| length2      = 2:09\n| title3       = The Secret of the Scrolls\n| length3      = 3:12\n| title4       = Introducing the Thompsons and Snowy's Chase\n| length4      = 4:08\n| title5       = Marlinspike Hall\n| length5      = 3:58\n| title6       = Escape from the Karaboudjan\n| length6      = 3:20\n| title7       = Sir Francis and the Unicorn\n| length7      = 5:05\n| title8       = Captain Haddock Takes the Oars\n| length8      = 2:17\n| title9       = Red Rackham's Curse and the Treasure\n| length9      = 6:10\n| title10      = Capturing Mr. Silk\n| length10     = 2:57\n| title11      = The Flight to Bagghar\n| length11     = 3:33\n| title12      = The Milanese Nightingale\n| length12     = 1:29\n| title13      = Presenting Bianca Castafiore\n| length13     = 3:27\n| title14      = The Pursuit of the Falcon\n| length14     = 5:43\n| title15      = The Captain's Counsel\n| length15     = 2:10\n| title16      = The Clash of the Cranes\n| length16     = 3:48\n| title17      = The Return to Marlinspike Hall and Finale\n| length17     = 5:51\n| title18      = The Adventure Continues\n| length18     = 2:58\n}}\n\n==Differences from the source material==\nThe film mainly draws its story from ''The Secret of the Unicorn'' (1943) and ''The Crab with the Golden Claws'' (1941) and to a much lesser degree, from ''Red Rackham's Treasure'' (1944). There are major differences from the source material, most notably with regard to the antagonists. In the book, Ivan Sakharine is a minor character, neither a villain nor the descendant of Red Rackham. As Sakharine was made the main antagonist in the film, the book's main villains, the [[Bird brothers]], are absent from the adaptation, save for a small \"cameo\" in the initial sequence at the market. As a result of this change, many events transpire that bear no relation to events in the books involving Sakharine's character.<ref name=\"Guardian_18Oct2011\">{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2011/oct/18/how-could-do-this-tintin/|title=How could they do this to Tintin?|work=The Guardian|date=18 October 2011|accessdate=1 February 2015}}</ref> As in other adaptations, Snowy's \"voice\" is not used.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}\n\n==Release==\n[[File:Spielberg and Tintin 2011.jpg|thumb|[[Steven Spielberg]] and a costumed character of Tintin at the film's [[premiere]] in Paris, 22 October 2011.]]\nThe film's first press-screening was held in Belgium on 10 October 2011.<ref name=\"la libre\">{{cite web|title=Les Aventuriers de la Licorne Perdue|url=http://www.lalibre.be/culture/cinema/article/691191/les-aventuriers-de-la-licorne-perdue.html|publisher=La Libre|accessdate=12 October 2011|language=French|date=12 October 2011}}</ref> The world premi\u00e8re was held in Brussels, Belgium on 22 October 2011\u2014attended by [[Princess Astrid of Belgium, Archduchess of Austria-Este|Princess Astrid]] and her younger daughters, [[Princess Luisa Maria of Belgium, Archduchess of Austria-Este|Princess Luisa Maria]] and [[Princess Laetitia Maria of Belgium, Archduchess of Austria-Este|Princess Laetitia Maria]]; with the Paris premi\u00e8re later the same day.<ref name=\"DT\">{{cite news|title=Tintin fans flock to Belgian film premiere|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/film/film-news/8844394/Tintin-fans-flock-to-Belgian-film-premiere.html|publisher=Daily Telegraph|accessdate=31 October 2011|date=22 October 2011|location=London}}</ref> Sony later released the film during late October and early November 2011 in Europe, Latin America and India.

After Tintin takes the model home to his apartment, it is accidentally broken during a chase between Snowy and a cat; a parchment scroll slips out of the ship and rolls under a piece of Tintin's furniture. Meanwhile, bumbling police detectives [[Thomson and Thompson]] are on the trail of [[pickpocket]] [[Aristides Silk]].\n\nAfter visiting Maritime Library to uncover the history surrounding the Unicorn, Tintin returns to find the ''Unicorn'' has been stolen, which he suspects Sakharine of doing. He heads to [[Marlinspike Hall]], where he accuses him of the theft, but noticing Sakharine's model is not broken, he realizes there are two ''Unicorn'' models. Tintin returns to his apartment, which has been ransacked, and is shown the scroll by Snowy. However, they are interrupted by the arrival of Barnaby, who is then assassinated while attempting to recover the ''Unicorn''.\n\nTintin places the scroll in his wallet, but is pick-pocketed by Silk the next morning and soon afterwards abducted by accomplices of Sakharine on the SS ''Karaboudjan''. He learns that Sakharine formed an alliance with the ship's staff and led a [[mutiny]] to take control. On board, Tintin encounters the ship's captain, [[Captain Haddock|Archibald Haddock]], who is permanently drunk and has forgotten most of his past. Tintin, Haddock and Snowy outrun the crew and escape from the ''Karaboudjan'' in a lifeboat. The ship attempts to ram their boat but instead ram an empty lifeboat Haddock accidentally released during his escape. Noticing that two lifeboats have been released, Sakharine presumes them to have survived and sends a [[seaplane]] to find and capture them. Feeling cold and thirsty on the lifeboat ride, Haddock foolishly uses a stowaway bottle of [[scotch whisky]] to put out a fire he started in the boat, causing an explosion that leaves the trio stranded on top of the upturned boat. The trio seize the seaplane and use it to fly towards the fictitious [[Morocco|Moroccan]] port of [[Settings in The Adventures of Tintin|Bagghar]], but it crashes in a desert due to low fuel and a thunderstorm.\n\nWhile trekking through the desert along with Tintin and Snowy, Haddock hallucinates and remembers his ancestor, [[Sir Francis Haddock]], the 17th-century captain of the ''Unicorn'', whose treasure-laden ship was attacked by the crew of a [[Piracy|pirate ship]] led by [[Red Rackham]], who is later revealed to be Sakharine's ancestor. Sir Francis surrendered, but since the pirates killed all of his crew, he chose to sink the ''Unicorn'', along with most of its treasure, to prevent it from falling into Rackham's hands. The story implies there were three ''Unicorn'' models, each containing a scroll; together, the scrolls can reveal coordinates of the location of the sunken ''Unicorn'' and its treasure.\n\nThe third model is in Bagghar, possessed by [[Omar ben Salaad]]. Sakharine causes a distraction in a [[Bianca Castafiore]] concert,which results in him stealing the third scroll. A chase through the city ensues, during which he gains all the scrolls. Just as he is ready to give up, Tintin is persuaded by Haddock to continue. With help from Thomson and Thompson, Tintin and Haddock track Sakharine back to Brussels and set up a trap, but Sakharine uses his pistol to resist arrest. When his men fail to save him, Sakharine challenges Haddock to a sword fight with the cranes at the dock. After the fight, Sakharine is pushed overboard by Haddock; he is then rescued and arrested by Thomson and Thompson.\n\nGuided by the three scrolls, which indicate the location of Marlinspike Hall, Tintin, Haddock and Snowy travel there. Inside, aided by Haddock, they find some of the treasure and a clue to the ''Unicorn''{{'}}s location; Tintin and Haddock both agree on setting up an expedition to find [[Red Rackham's Treasure]].\n\n==Voice cast==\n* [[Jamie Bell]] as [[Tintin (character)|Tintin]].<ref name=\"pr\">{{cite news |title=Paramount Pictures and Sony Pictures Entertainment Announce the January&nbsp;26 Start of Principal Photography on the 3D Motion Capture Feature 'The Adventures of Tintin: Secret of the Unicorn' Directed by Steven Spielberg and Starring Jamie Bell and Daniel Craig |publisher=[[PR Newswire]] |url=http://news.prnewswire.com/ViewContent.aspx?ACCT=109&STORY=/www/story/01-26-2009/0004960578&EDATE= |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090201055406/http://news.prnewswire.com/ViewContent.aspx?ACCT=109&STORY=%2Fwww%2Fstory%2F01-26-2009%2F0004960578&EDATE= |url-status=dead |archive-date=1 February 2009 |accessdate=26 January 2009 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> Bell replaced [[Thomas Brodie-Sangster]], who dropped out when filming was delayed in October 2008.<ref name=\"delay\" /> Jackson suggested Bell to take on the role after previously casting him as Jimmy in his ''[[King Kong (2005 film)|King Kong]]'' remake.<ref name=\"dig\" />\n* [[Andy Serkis]] as [[Captain Archibald Haddock]] and [[Sir Francis Haddock]].<ref name=\"interpol\">{{cite news|author=Jay A.

The composer decided to employ various musical styles, with \"1920s, 1930s European jazz\" for the opening credits and \"pirate music\" for the battle at sea.<ref>\"Tintin: The Score\", ''The Adventures of Tintin'' DVD</ref> The score was released on 21 October 2011 by [[Sony Classical Records]].<ref>{{cite web|title=The Adventures Of Tintin: John Williams|url=https://www.amazon.fr/The-Adventures-Of-Tintin/dp/B005VTVLOO|publisher=Amazon.fr|accessdate=30 January 2012|date=21 October 2011}}</ref>\n\n;Track listing\n{{Track listing\n| all_music    = [[John Williams]]\n| total_length = {{duration|m=65|s=22}}\n| title1       = The Adventures of Tintin\n| length1      = 3:07\n| title2       = Snowy's Theme\n| length2      = 2:09\n| title3       = The Secret of the Scrolls\n| length3      = 3:12\n| title4       = Introducing the Thompsons and Snowy's Chase\n| length4      = 4:08\n| title5       = Marlinspike Hall\n| length5      = 3:58\n| title6       = Escape from the Karaboudjan\n| length6      = 3:20\n| title7       = Sir Francis and the Unicorn\n| length7      = 5:05\n| title8       = Captain Haddock Takes the Oars\n| length8      = 2:17\n| title9       = Red Rackham's Curse and the Treasure\n| length9      = 6:10\n| title10      = Capturing Mr. Silk\n| length10     = 2:57\n| title11      = The Flight to Bagghar\n| length11     = 3:33\n| title12      = The Milanese Nightingale\n| length12     = 1:29\n| title13      = Presenting Bianca Castafiore\n| length13     = 3:27\n| title14      = The Pursuit of the Falcon\n| length14     = 5:43\n| title15      = The Captain's Counsel\n| length15     = 2:10\n| title16      = The Clash of the Cranes\n| length16     = 3:48\n| title17      = The Return to Marlinspike Hall and Finale\n| length17     = 5:51\n| title18      = The Adventure Continues\n| length18     = 2:58\n}}\n\n==Differences from the source material==\nThe film mainly draws its story from ''The Secret of the Unicorn'' (1943) and ''The Crab with the Golden Claws'' (1941) and to a much lesser degree, from ''Red Rackham's Treasure'' (1944). There are major differences from the source material, most notably with regard to the antagonists. In the book, Ivan Sakharine is a minor character, neither a villain nor the descendant of Red Rackham. As Sakharine was made the main antagonist in the film, the book's main villains, the [[Bird brothers]], are absent from the adaptation, save for a small \"cameo\" in the initial sequence at the market. As a result of this change, many events transpire that bear no relation to events in the books involving Sakharine's character.<ref name=\"Guardian_18Oct2011\">{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2011/oct/18/how-could-do-this-tintin/|title=How could they do this to Tintin?|work=The Guardian|date=18 October 2011|accessdate=1 February 2015}}</ref> As in other adaptations Snowy's \"voice\" is not used.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}\n\n==Release==\n[[File:Spielberg and Tintin 2011.jpg|thumb|[[Steven Spielberg]] and a costumed character of Tintin at the film's [[premiere]] in Paris, 22 October 2011.]]\nThe film's first press-screening was held in Belgium on 10 October 2011.<ref name=\"la libre\">{{cite web|title=Les Aventuriers de la Licorne Perdue|url=http://www.lalibre.be/culture/cinema/article/691191/les-aventuriers-de-la-licorne-perdue.html|publisher=La Libre|accessdate=12 October 2011|language=French|date=12 October 2011}}</ref> The world premi\u00e8re was held in Brussels, Belgium on 22 October 2011\u2014attended by [[Princess Astrid of Belgium, Archduchess of Austria-Este|Princess Astrid]] and her younger daughters, [[Princess Luisa Maria of Belgium, Archduchess of Austria-Este|Princess Luisa Maria]] and [[Princess Laetitia Maria of Belgium, Archduchess of Austria-Este|Princess Laetitia Maria]]; with the Paris premi\u00e8re later the same day.<ref name=\"DT\">{{cite news|title=Tintin fans flock to Belgian film premiere|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/film/film-news/8844394/Tintin-fans-flock-to-Belgian-film-premiere.html|publisher=Daily Telegraph|accessdate=31 October 2011|date=22 October 2011|location=London}}</ref> Sony later released the film during late October and early November 2011 in Europe, Latin America and India.

The new state consisted mostly of territories inhabited by [[Czechs]] and [[Slovaks]], but also included areas containing majority populations of other nationalities, particularly [[Germans]] (22.95 %), who accounted for more citizens than the state's second state nation of the [[Slovaks]]<ref name=\"Teich\"> {{cite book|author=Mikulas Teich|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1998|pages=375|title=Bohemia in History}} </ref>, [[Hungarians]] (5.47 %) and [[Ruthenians]] (3.39 %). The new state comprised the total of [[Bohemia]] whose borders did not coincide with the language border between German and Czech. Despite initially developing [[Elections in Czechoslovakia (1918\u20131938)|effective representative institutions]] alongside a [[Economy of Communist Czechoslovakia#Before socialism|successful economy]], the deteriorating international economic situation in the 1930s gave rise to growing ethnic tensions. The dispute between the Czech and German populations, fanned by the rise of [[National Socialism]] in neighbouring Germany, resulted in the loss of territory under the terms of the [[Munich Agreement]] and subsequent events in the autumn of 1938, bringing about the end of the [[First Republic of Czechoslovakia|First Republic]].\n\n==Independence==\n[[Image:TGM Tabor 21.12.1918 3462a.jpg|thumb|right|Tom\u00e1\u0161 Masaryk returning from exile]]\n\nFollowing the [[Pittsburgh Agreement]] of May 1918, the [[Czechoslovak declaration of independence]], created in Washington,<ref>Precl\u00edk, Vratislav.

Towards the end of the [[First World War]] which led to the collapse of the [[Austrian-Hungarian Empire]], several ethnic groups and territories with different historical, political, and economic traditions were blended into new state structures. In the face of such obstacles, the creation of [[democracy]] in Czechoslovakia was indeed a triumph.\n\nInitial authority within [[Czechoslovakia]] was assumed by the newly created [[National Assembly]] on November&nbsp;14, 1918. Because territorial demarcations were uncertain and [[elections]] impossible, the provisional National Assembly was constituted on the basis of the 1911 [[election]]s to the [[Reichsrat (Austria)|Austrian parliament]] with the addition of 54 representatives from [[Slovakia]]. [[National minorities]] were not represented. Hungarians remained loyal to [[Kingdom of Hungary (1920\u20131946)|Hungary]].\n\nOn November&nbsp;12, 1918, the short-lived [[Republic of German Austria]] was declared, with the intent of unifying with [[Weimar Republic|Germany]], relying on [[Woodrow Wilson|President Wilson]]'s principle of [[self-determination]]. The state claimed all the German-speaking areas of the former [[Cisleithania]], including [[Germans in Czechoslovakia (1918\u20131938)|those in Czechoslovakia]].\n\nThe National Assembly of Czechoslovakia elected [[Tom\u00e1\u0161 Garrigue Masaryk]] as its first president, chose a provisional government headed by [[Karel Kram\u00e1\u0159]], and drafted a [[provisional constitution]].\n\nThe [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919|Paris Peace Conference]] convened in January 1919. The [[Czech people|Czech]] delegation was led by Kram\u00e1\u0159 and [[Edvard Bene\u0161|Bene\u0161]], premier and foreign minister respectively, of the Czechoslovak provisional government. The conference approved the establishment of the [[First Czechoslovak Republic|Czechoslovak Republic]], to encompass the [[Lands of the Bohemian Crown|crown lands]] of the historic [[Bohemian Kingdom]] ([[Bohemia]], [[Moravia]], and [[Czech Silesia|Silesia]]), Slovakia, and [[Carpathian Ruthenia]]. The inclusion of Ruthenia provided a common frontier with [[Romania]], an important ally against Hungary. To address concerns of the British delegation that the incorporation of exclusively German-settled areas violates the principle of [[self-determination]], the [[Czech people|Czech]] delegation had presented to the conference a memorandum containing misrepresentations of the German-settled areas. No German or Austrian delegation was present the conference. Additionally, the memorandum proposed the [[Swiss Confederation]] as a model for the constitution of the new state, which however was not realized in the new state.<ref>{{cite book|lang=de|author=Wolfgang Hippmann|title=Vogelfrei und der Heimat beraubt. Die Vertreibung der Sudetendeutschen 1945|pages=11}}</ref>  \n\nIn March 1919<ref>''[[Daily Telegraph]]'' 15 March 1919, reprinted in ''Daily Telegraph'' 15 March 2019, page 32</ref> there were reports that:\n*Austria and Czechoslovakia had broken off [[diplomatic relations]].\n*Czechoslovakia's government in [[Prague]] alleged a conspiracy between Austria and [[Kingdom of Saxony|Saxony]] to invade Czechoslovakia.\nThe dispute was over possession of the German-speaking parts of Bohemia and Moravia (later known as the [[Sudetenland]]); their German-speaking inhabitants had declared themselves to part of Austria, and if that was prevented, demanded to be annexed by Saxony and the German Republics. Czechoslovakia wanted to hold onto this area because of its many valuable [[mining|mines]]. Czechoslovakia sent Czech troops into the German area to stop disorders, and the Vienna press printed reports of Czech troops firing on and killing Germans in that area, including 15\u201320 in [[Kaaden]], 3 in [[Eger]], and 2 in [[Karlovy Vary|Karlsbad]]. During this, on about March&nbsp;1, Herr Mayer, Austria's [[Minister of War]] (a native of Eger), went to go to Eger and was arrested at [[Gratzen]] after crossing the border, but was allowed to continue to Eger; two days later he went into Germany via [[Sch\u00e4rding]], and by railway via [[Regensburg]] and [[Passau]] back to Vienna.\n\nIn January 1920 the Czechoslovakian army, breaking prior agreements with [[Second Polish Republic|Poland]], crossed the demarcation line and by force of arms occupied the [[Zaolzie]], where a 60% majority of the population was Polish, compared to 25% Czechs. After brief fights they made a truce on the power of which Czechoslovakia occupied areas to the west of [[Olza River]]. The Czech claim to [[Lusatia]], which had been part of the Bohemian Kingdom until the [[Thirty Years' War]], was rejected. \n\nOn September&nbsp;10, 1919, Czechoslovakia signed the Minorities Treaty, placing its ethnic minorities under the protection of the [[League of Nations]].\n\n==Statehood==\nThe establishment of the [[Czechoslovak Constitution of 1920|Constitution of 1920]] installed a [[parliamentary system]] and [[representative democracy]] with relatively few [[Electoral district|constituents]] for each representative. This allowed a great variety of [[Political party|political parties]] to emerge, with no clear front runner or leading political entity.\n\n[[Tom\u00e1\u0161 Masaryk|Tom\u00e1\u0161 Garrigue Masaryk]] was elected the country's first president in the 1920 election and his guidance helped to hold the country together. A coalition of five Czechoslovak parties, which became known as the \"[[P\u011btka]]\" (The Five), constituted the backbone of the government and maintained stability. Prime Minister [[Antonin Svehla]] led the P\u011btka for most of the 1920s and designed a pattern of coalition politics that survived until 1938. Masaryk was re-elected in 1925 and 1929, serving as President until December&nbsp;14, 1935 when he resigned due to poor health. He was succeeded by [[Edvard Bene\u0161]].\n\n[[Image:Czechoslovakia01.png|thumb|250px|Czechoslovakia in 1928]]\n\nBene\u0161 had served as Czechoslovak [[foreign minister]] from 1918 to 1935, and created the system of alliances that determined the republic's international stance until 1938. A democratic statesman of Western orientation, Bene\u0161 relied heavily on the [[League of Nations]] as guarantor of the post war [[status quo]] and the security of newly formed states. He negotiated the [[Little Entente]] (an alliance with [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]] and [[Romania]]) in 1921 to counter [[Hungary|Hungarian]] [[revanchism]] and [[Habsburg]] restoration.\n\nThe leaders of Czechoslovakia needed to find solutions for the multiplicity of cultures living within one country. From 1928 and 1940, Czechoslovakia was divided into the four \"lands\" ({{lang-cs|zem\u011b}}, {{lang-sk|krajiny}}); Bohemia, Moravia-Silesia, Slovakia and Carpathian Ruthenia. Although in 1927 assemblies were provided for Bohemia, Slovakia, and Ruthenia, their jurisdiction was limited to adjusting laws and regulations of the central government to local needs. National minorities were assured special protection; in districts where they constituted 20% of the population, members of minority groups were granted full freedom to use their language in everyday life, in schools, and in matters dealing with authorities. [[Germany|German]] parties also participated in the government starting in 1926, while [[Hungarians|Hungarian]] parties, supporting Hungarian irredentist claims, never joined the Czechoslovak government but were not openly hostile to it.\n\n==Growing conflict==\nDue to Czechoslovakia's centralized political structure, nationalism arose in the non-Czech nationalities, and several parties and movements were formed with the aim of broader political autonomy.  The [[Hlinka's Slovak People's Party|Slovak People's Party]] led by [[Andrej Hlinka]] is an example.\n\nWhen German dictator [[Adolf Hitler]] came to power in 1933, fear of German aggression became widespread in eastern Central Europe. Bene\u0161 ignored the possibility of a stronger Central European alliance system, remaining faithful to his Western policy. He did, however, seek the participation of the [[Soviet Union]] in an alliance to include [[France]]. (Bene\u0161's earlier attitude towards the Soviet regime had been one of caution.) In 1935 the Soviet Union signed treaties with France and Czechoslovakia. In essence, the treaties provided that the Soviet Union would come to Czechoslovakia's aid, but only if French assistance came first. Hitler himself remarked to his foreign minister von Neurath and top military officials in 1937 that he intended to absorb Bohemia and Austria, with a vague sentence about the need to expel two million Czechs and the eventual elimination of the Czech nation.<ref>''Prague in black: Nazi rule and Czech nationalism, p. 108\u2013109, Chad Carl Bryant, Harvard University Press 2007</ref>\n\nThere was [[Germans in Czechoslovakia (1918\u20131938)|a large German minority in Czechoslovakia]], mostly living in [[Sudetenland]]. \n[[File:Czechoslovakia1930linguistic.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|Linguistic map of interwar Czechoslovakia (c. 1930).]]\nThey demanded [[autonomy]] within Czechoslovakia, claiming they were oppressed by the national government. The political vehicle for this agitation was the newly founded [[Sudeten German Party]] (''Sudetendeutsche Partei'' - SdP) led by [[Konrad Henlein]], and financed with Nazi money. {{Citation needed|reason=other sources tell that the rise of the SdP started before the rise of the Nazis|date=February 2019}} In the 1935 Parliamentary elections, the SdP had a surprise success, securing over 2/3 of the [[Sudeten German]] vote. This worsened diplomatic relations between Germany and Czechoslovakia. Hitler met with Henlein in Berlin on March&nbsp;28, 1938, and ordered him to raise demands unacceptable to the Czechoslovak government. On April&nbsp;24, the SdP issued the [[Carlsbad Programme]], demanding autonomy for the Sudetenland and the freedom to profess [[Nazism|Nazi ideology]]. If these demands were granted, the Sudetenland could then align with Nazi Germany.\n\nOn 17 September 1938 Adolf Hitler ordered the establishment of [[Sudetendeutsches Freikorps]], a paramilitary organization that took over the structure of Ordnersgruppe, an organization of ethnic-Germans in Czechoslovakia that had been dissolved by the Czechoslovak authorities the previous day due to its implication in large number of terrorist activities. The organization was sheltered, trained and equipped by German authorities and conducting cross border terrorist operations into Czechoslovak territory. Relying on the [[War of aggression#The Convention for the Definition of Aggression|Convention for the Definition of Aggression]], Czechoslovak president [[Edvard Bene\u0161]]<ref>President Bene\u0161' declaration made on 16 December 1941</ref> and the [[Czechoslovak government-in-exile|government-in-exile]]<ref>Note of the Czechoslovak government-in-exile dated 22 February 1944</ref> later regarded 17 September 1938 as the beginning of the undeclared German-Czechoslovak war.

The new state consisted mostly of territories inhabited by [[Czechs]] and [[Slovaks]], but also included areas containing majority populations of other nationalities, particularly [[Germans]] (22.95 %), who accounted for more citizens than the state's second state nation of the [[Slovaks]]<ref name=\"Teich\"> {{cite book|author=Mikulas Teich|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1998|pages=375|title=Bohemia in History}} </ref>, [[Hungarians]] (5.47 %) and [[Ruthenians]] (3.39 %). The new state comprised the total of [[Bohemia]] whose borders did not coincide with the language border between German and Czech. Despite initially developing [[Elections in Czechoslovakia (1918\u20131938)|effective representative institutions]] alongside a [[Economy of Communist Czechoslovakia#Before socialism|successful economy]], the deteriorating international economic situation in the 1930s gave rise to growing ethnic tensions. The dispute between the Czech and German populations, fanned by the rise of [[National Socialism]] in neighbouring Germany, resulted in the loss of territory under the terms of the [[Munich Agreement]] and subsequent events in the autumn of 1938, bringing about the end of the [[First Republic of Czechoslovakia|First Republic]].\n\n==Independence==\n[[Image:TGM Tabor 21.12.1918 3462a.jpg|thumb|right|Tom\u00e1\u0161 Masaryk returning from exile]]\n\nFollowing the [[Pittsburgh Agreement]] of May 1918, the [[Czechoslovak declaration of independence]], created in Washington,<ref>Precl\u00edk, Vratislav.

Towards the end of the [[First World War]] which led to the collapse of the [[Austrian-Hungarian Empire]], several ethnic groups and territories with different historical, political, and economic traditions were blended into new state structures. In the face of such obstacles, the creation of [[democracy]] in Czechoslovakia was indeed a triumph.\n\nInitial authority within [[Czechoslovakia]] was assumed by the newly created [[National Assembly]] on November&nbsp;14, 1918. Because territorial demarcations were uncertain and [[elections]] impossible, the provisional National Assembly was constituted on the basis of the 1911 [[election]]s to the [[Reichsrat (Austria)|Austrian parliament]] with the addition of 54 representatives from [[Slovakia]]. [[National minorities]] were not represented. Hungarians remained loyal to [[Kingdom of Hungary (1920\u20131946)|Hungary]].\n\nOn November&nbsp;12, 1918, the short-lived [[Republic of German Austria]] was declared, with the intent of unifying with [[Weimar Republic|Germany]], relying on [[Woodrow Wilson|President Wilson]]'s principle of [[self-determination]]. The state claimed all the German-speaking areas of the former [[Cisleithania]], including [[Germans in Czechoslovakia (1918\u20131938)|those in Czechoslovakia]].\n\nThe National Assembly of Czechoslovakia elected [[Tom\u00e1\u0161 Garrigue Masaryk]] as its first president, chose a provisional government headed by [[Karel Kram\u00e1\u0159]], and drafted a [[provisional constitution]].\n\nThe [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919|Paris Peace Conference]] convened in January 1919. The [[Czech people|Czech]] delegation was led by Kram\u00e1\u0159 and [[Edvard Bene\u0161|Bene\u0161]], premier and foreign minister respectively, of the Czechoslovak provisional government. The conference approved the establishment of the [[First Czechoslovak Republic|Czechoslovak Republic]], to encompass the [[Lands of the Bohemian Crown|crown lands]] of the historic [[Bohemian Kingdom]] ([[Bohemia]], [[Moravia]], and [[Czech Silesia|Silesia]]), Slovakia, and [[Carpathian Ruthenia]]. The inclusion of Ruthenia provided a common frontier with [[Romania]], an important ally against Hungary. To address concerns of the British delegation that the incorporation of exclusively German-settled areas violates the principle of [[self-determination]], the [[Czech people|Czech]] delegation had presented to the conference a memorandum containing misrepresentations of the German-settled areas. No German or Austrian delegation was present the conference. Additionally, the memorandum proposed the [[Swiss Confederation]] as a model for the constitution of the new state, which however was not realized in the new state.<ref>{{cite book|lang=de|author=Wolfgang Hippmann|title=Vogelfrei und der Heimat beraubt. Die Vertreibung der Sudetendeutschen 1945|pages=11}}</ref>  \n\nIn March 1919<ref>''[[Daily Telegraph]]'' 15 March 1919, reprinted in ''Daily Telegraph'' 15 March 2019, page 32</ref> there were reports that:\n*Austria and Czechoslovakia had broken off [[diplomatic relations]].\n*Czechoslovakia's government in [[Prague]] alleged a conspiracy between Austria and [[Kingdom of Saxony|Saxony]] to invade Czechoslovakia.\nThe dispute was over possession of the German-speaking parts of Bohemia and Moravia (later known as the [[Sudetenland]]); their German-speaking inhabitants had declared themselves to part of Austria, and if that was prevented, demanded to be annexed by Saxony and the German Republics. Czechoslovakia wanted to hold onto this area because of its many valuable [[mining|mines]]. Czechoslovakia sent Czech troops into the German area to stop disorders, and the Vienna press printed reports of Czech troops firing on and killing Germans in that area, including 15\u201320 in [[Kaaden]], 3 in [[Eger]], and 2 in [[Karlovy Vary|Karlsbad]]. During this, on about March&nbsp;1, Herr Mayer, Austria's [[Minister of War]] (a native of Eger), went to go to Eger and was arrested at [[Gratzen]] after crossing the border, but was allowed to continue to Eger; two days later he went into Germany via [[Sch\u00e4rding]], and by railway via [[Regensburg]] and [[Passau]] back to Vienna.\n\nIn January 1920 the Czechoslovakian army, breaking prior agreements with [[Second Polish Republic|Poland]], crossed the demarcation line and by force of arms occupied the [[Zaolzie]], where a 60% majority of the population was Polish, compared to 25% Czechs. After brief fights they made a truce on the power of which Czechoslovakia occupied areas to the west of [[Olza River]]. The Czech claim to [[Lusatia]], which had been part of the Bohemian Kingdom until the [[Thirty Years' War]], was rejected. \n\nOn September&nbsp;10, 1919, Czechoslovakia signed the Minorities Treaty, placing its ethnic minorities under the protection of the [[League of Nations]].\n\n==Statehood==\nThe establishment of the [[Czechoslovak Constitution of 1920|Constitution of 1920]] installed a [[parliamentary system]] and [[representative democracy]] with relatively few [[Electoral district|constituents]] for each representative. This allowed a great variety of [[Political party|political parties]] to emerge, with no clear front runner or leading political entity.\n\n[[Tom\u00e1\u0161 Masaryk|Tom\u00e1\u0161 Garrigue Masaryk]] was elected the country's first president in the 1920 election and his guidance helped to hold the country together. A coalition of five Czechoslovak parties, which  became known as the \"[[P\u011btka]]\" (The Five), constituted the backbone of the government and maintained stability. Prime Minister [[Antonin Svehla]] led the P\u011btka for most of the 1920s and designed a pattern of coalition politics that survived until 1938. Masaryk was re-elected in 1925 and 1929, serving as President until December&nbsp;14, 1935 when he resigned due to poor health. He was succeeded by [[Edvard Bene\u0161]].\n\n[[Image:Czechoslovakia01.png|thumb|250px|Czechoslovakia in 1928]]\n\nBene\u0161 had served as Czechoslovak [[foreign minister]] from 1918 to 1935, and created the system of alliances that determined the republic's international stance until 1938. A democratic statesman of Western orientation, Bene\u0161 relied heavily on the [[League of Nations]] as guarantor of the post war [[status quo]] and the security of newly formed states. He negotiated the [[Little Entente]] (an alliance with [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]] and [[Romania]]) in 1921 to counter [[Hungary|Hungarian]] [[revanchism]] and [[Habsburg]] restoration.\n\nThe leaders of Czechoslovakia needed to find solutions for the multiplicity of cultures living within one country. From 1928 and 1940, Czechoslovakia was divided into the four \"lands\" ([[Czech language|Czech]]: \"zem\u011b\", [[Slovak language|Slovak]]: \"krajiny\"); Bohemia, Moravia-Silesia, Slovakia and Carpathian Ruthenia. Although in 1927 assemblies were provided for Bohemia, Slovakia, and Ruthenia, their jurisdiction was limited to adjusting laws and regulations of the central government to local needs. National minorities were assured special protection; in districts where they constituted 20% of the population, members of minority groups were granted full freedom to use their language in everyday life, in schools, and in matters dealing with authorities. [[Germany|German]] parties also participated in the government starting in 1926, while [[Hungarians|Hungarian]] parties, supporting Hungarian irredentist claims, never joined the Czechoslovak government but were not openly hostile to it.\n\n==Growing conflict==\nDue to Czechoslovakia's centralized political structure, nationalism arose in the non-Czech nationalities, and several parties and movements were formed with the aim of broader political autonomy.  The [[Hlinka's Slovak People's Party|Slovak People's Party]] led by [[Andrej Hlinka]] is an example.\n\nWhen German dictator [[Adolf Hitler]] came to power in 1933, fear of German aggression became widespread in eastern Central Europe. Bene\u0161 ignored the possibility of a stronger Central European alliance system, remaining faithful to his Western policy. He did, however, seek the participation of the [[Soviet Union]] in an alliance to include [[France]]. (Bene\u0161's earlier attitude towards the Soviet regime had been one of caution.) In 1935 the Soviet Union signed treaties with France and Czechoslovakia. In essence, the treaties provided that the Soviet Union would come to Czechoslovakia's aid, but only if French assistance came first. Hitler himself remarked to his foreign minister von Neurath and top military officials in 1937 that he intended to absorb Bohemia and Austria, with a vague sentence about the need to expel two million Czechs and the eventual elimination of the Czech nation.<ref>''Prague in black: Nazi rule and Czech nationalism, p. 108\u2013109, Chad Carl Bryant, Harvard University Press 2007</ref>\n\nThere was [[Germans in Czechoslovakia (1918\u20131938)|a large German minority in Czechoslovakia]], mostly living in [[Sudetenland]]. \n[[File:Czechoslovakia1930linguistic.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|Linguistic map of interwar Czechoslovakia (c. 1930).]]\nThey demanded [[autonomy]] within Czechoslovakia, claiming they were oppressed by the national government. The political vehicle for this agitation was the newly founded [[Sudeten German Party]] (''Sudetendeutsche Partei'' - SdP) led by [[Konrad Henlein]], and financed with Nazi money. {{Citation needed|reason=other sources tell that the rise of the SdP started before the rise of the Nazis|date=February 2019}} In the 1935 Parliamentary elections, the SdP had a surprise success, securing over 2/3 of the [[Sudeten German]] vote. This worsened diplomatic relations between Germany and Czechoslovakia. Hitler met with Henlein in Berlin on March&nbsp;28, 1938, and ordered him to raise demands unacceptable to the Czechoslovak government. On April&nbsp;24, the SdP issued the [[Carlsbad Programme]], demanding autonomy for the Sudetenland and the freedom to profess [[Nazism|Nazi ideology]]. If these demands were granted, the Sudetenland could then align with Nazi Germany.\n\nOn 17 September 1938 Adolf Hitler ordered the establishment of [[Sudetendeutsches Freikorps]], a paramilitary organization that took over the structure of Ordnersgruppe, an organization of ethnic-Germans in Czechoslovakia that had been dissolved by the Czechoslovak authorities the previous day due to its implication in large number of terrorist activities. The organization was sheltered, trained and equipped by German authorities and conducting cross border terrorist operations into Czechoslovak territory. Relying on the [[War of aggression#The Convention for the Definition of Aggression|Convention for the Definition of Aggression]], Czechoslovak president [[Edvard Bene\u0161]]<ref>President Bene\u0161' declaration made on 16 December 1941</ref> and the [[Czechoslovak government-in-exile|government-in-exile]]<ref>Note of the Czechoslovak government-in-exile dated 22 February 1944</ref> later regarded 17 September 1938 as the beginning of the undeclared German-Czechoslovak war.
