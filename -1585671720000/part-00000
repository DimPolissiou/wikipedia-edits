For example, they may secrete [[organic acid]]s that dissolve or [[Chelation|chelate]] many ions, or release them from minerals by [[ion exchange]].<ref>[http://cropsoil.psu.edu/sylvia/mycorrhiza.htm] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100623051447/http://cropsoil.psu.edu/sylvia/mycorrhiza.htm|date=June 23, 2010}}</ref> Mycorrhizae are especially beneficial for the plant partner in nutrient-poor soils.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.biologie.uni-hamburg.de/b-online/e33/33b.htm |title=Botany online: Interactions - Plants - Fungi - Parasitic and Symbiotic Relations - Mycorrhiza |publisher=Biologie.uni-hamburg.de |accessdate=2010-09-30 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110606050759/http://www.biologie.uni-hamburg.de/b-online/e33/33b.htm |archivedate=2011-06-06 }}</ref>\n\n===Disease, drought and salinity resistance and its correlation to mycorrhizae===\nMycorrhizal plants are often more resistant to diseases, such as those caused by microbial soil-borne [[pathogen]]s.

He was tasked on several occasions with fortifying strategically important areas and also reconstruction, including all [[Black Sea]] ports during and after [[World War II]]. He served primarily on [[military engineering]] and defense strategy posts, including being the Deputy [[Minister of Defence of Soviet Union|Minister of Defence]] and would play a major role in the structural development of the Soviet armed forces and strategic missile forces during the Cold War era. An avenue in Georgia's capital [[Tbilisi]] and a street in the city of [[Sevastopol]] have been named after Marshal Gelovani.<ref>http://sevastopol.su/person.php?id=234</ref>\n\n==Early life==\nGelovani was born in November 27, 1915 in the village Spatagori of the [[Tsageri District]] in Georgia. The boy was not yet six years old when his father, known in the Caucasus as Viktor Gelovani the engineer, died of typhoid fever. The orphan had to learn to live and grow up the hard way. But instead of breaking the young man, it only contributed in steeling his character.<ref>http://sevastopol.su/person.php?id=234</ref>\n\nIn 1936 after graduating from the Tbilisi Industrial Institute, he started his career as engineer. After only three years his life took a radical change. Gelovani joined the [[Soviet Army]] as the army was in need of competent experts, since it became clearer that a war would be the case soon or later. The young engineer quickly found his place in the armed forces and rose through its ranks.<ref>http://sevastopol.su/person.php?id=234</ref>\n\n==Military career==\n\nAs a military technician of 1st rank, he began his activities with the [[Black Sea Fleet]] and got soon appointed to chief engineer for constructions. The [[Great Patriotic War]] found him quickly when he led a small task force of engineers to construct several artillery positions and place artillery batteries on them under heaviest enemy shelling and impossible conditions. The 152&nbsp;mm guns would play a great role during the Battle of Perekop which was part of the [[Crimean Offensive]]. For completing this mission Gelovani received his first and personally most memorable award, the [[Order of the Red Star]]. Many more would follow.\n\nIn the postwar years, Archil Gelovani's work was accociated mainly to Reconstruction, particularly coastal areas of the Black Sea. Thus in 1953 he was appointed Chief of Military Infrastructure in the port city of [[Sevastopol]], which was heavily damaged during the war. The reconstruction of Sevastopol was given high importance as it would serve as the main base of the Black Fleet and was strictly observed by Moscow. Due to his huge success and numerous other efforts in the area, Gelovani would be later granted the title of 'Honorary Citizen and Hero of Sevastopol' in 1976. One of Sevastopols streets was also named after him.\n\nFrom 1956 to 1959 Gelovani performed construction works while being second in command of the Black Sea Fleet. Later on the same year, he got appointed to deputy commander of the [[Soviet Navy]] Construction Buro with the rank of [[Major-General]].<ref>http://sevastopol.su/person.php?id=234</ref> \n\nThe success of military builder Archil Gelovani evaluated which made him receive a position as Chief Engineer of the [[Strategic Missile Troops]]. It was then in 1962, when a new branch in the armed forces celebrated its second year. The Engineering forces had to complete a gigant task which was to build missile systems and launchers in time and quickly put them on alert. In 1968 Gelovani received the [[Lenin Prize]] for the development and implementation of special military facilities. A few years later he would also receive the [[State Prize]] in accordance to the successful emplacement and in time readiness of all strategic missiles.     \n\nIn 1974 the prince was appointed to Deputy Minister of Defence for Construction and Quartering of Troops. A huge map in his office covered symbols of construction projects. In 1977 for serving as engineer, organizer and guide for the construction of countless military and also civilian infrastructure, [[Colonel General]] Archil V Gelovani was awarded the title [[Chief Marshal|Chief Marshal of  Engineering Troops]].<ref>http://sevastopol.su/person.php?id=234</ref>\n\n==Death==\n\nAs a result of an unknown disease, Marshal Prince Archil Gelovali died on August 19, 1978 in Moscow.

He served primarily on [[military engineering]] and defense strategy posts, including being the Deputy [[Minister of Defence of Soviet Union|Minister of Defence]] and would play a major role in the structural development of the Soviet armed forces and strategic missile forces during the Cold War era. An avenue in Georgia's capital [[Tbilisi]] and a street in the city of [[Sevastopol]] have been named after Marshal Gelovani.<ref>http://sevastopol.su/person.php?id=234</ref>\n\n==Early life==\nGelovani was born in November 27, 1915 in the village Spatagori of the [[Tsageri District]] in Georgia. The boy was not yet six years old when his father, known in the Caucasus as Viktor Gelovani the engineer, died of typhoid fever. The orphan had to learn to live and grow up the hard way. But instead of breaking the young man, it only contributed in steeling his character.<ref>http://sevastopol.su/person.php?id=234</ref>\n\nIn 1936 after graduating from the Tbilisi Industrial Institute, he started his career as engineer. After only three years his life took a radical change. Gelovani joined the [[Soviet Army]] as the army was in need of competent experts, since it became clearer that a war would be the case soon or later. The young engineer quickly found his place in the armed forces and rose through its ranks.<ref>http://sevastopol.su/person.php?id=234</ref>\n\n==Military career==\n\nAs a military technician of 1st rank, he began his activities with the [[Black Sea Fleet]] and got soon appointed to chief engineer for constructions. The [[Great Patriotic War]] found him quickly when he led a small task force of engineers to construct several artillery positions and place artillery batteries on them under heaviest enemy shelling and impossible conditions. The 152&nbsp;mm guns would play a great role during the Battle of Perekop which was part of the [[Crimean Offensive]]. For completing this mission Gelovani received his first and personally most memorable award, the [[Order of the Red Star]]. Many more would follow.\n\nIn the postwar years, Archil Gelovani's work was accociated mainly to Reconstruction, particularly coastal areas of the Black Sea. Thus in 1953 he was appointed Chief of Military Infrastructure in the port city of [[Sevastopol]], which was heavily damaged during the war. The reconstruction of Sevastopol was given high importance as it would serve as the main base of the Black Fleet and was strictly observed by Moscow. Due to his huge success and numerous other efforts in the area, Gelovani would be later granted the title of 'Honorary Citizen and Hero of Sevastopol' in 1976. One of Sevastopols streets was also named after him.\n\nFrom 1956 to 1959 Gelovani performed construction works while being second in command of the Black Sea Fleet. Later on the same year, he got appointed to deputy commander of the [[Soviet Navy]] Construction Buro with the rank of [[Major-General]].<ref>http://sevastopol.su/person.php?id=234</ref> \n\nThe success of military builder Archil Gelovani evaluated which made him receive a position as Chief Engineer of the [[Strategic Missile Troops]]. It was then in 1962, when a new branch in the armed forces celebrated its second year. The Engineering forces had to complete a gigant task which was to build missile systems and launchers in time and quickly put them on alert. In 1968 Gelovani received the [[Lenin Prize]] for the development and implementation of special military facilities. A few years later he would also receive the [[State Prize]] in accordance to the successful emplacement and in time readiness of all strategic missiles.     \n\nIn 1974 the prince was appointed to Deputy Minister of Defence for Construction and Quartering of Troops. A huge map in his office covered symbols of construction projects. In 1977 for serving as engineer, organizer and guide for the construction of countless military and also civilian infrastructure, [[Colonel General]] Archill V Gelovani was awarded the title [[Chief Marshal|Chief Marshal of  Engineering Troops]].<ref>http://sevastopol.su/person.php?id=234</ref>\n\n==Death==\n\nAs a result of an unknown disease, Marshal Prince Archil Gelovali died on August 19, 1978 in Moscow. In the hospital he gave a short interview to one of the military magazines:<ref>http://sevastopol.su/person.php?id=234</ref>\n{{cquote|<blockquote>The real builder can only be someone who loves his profession, and even more - the people ... </blockquote>}}\n\nHe was buried in the [[Novodevichy Cemetery]] in Moscow.{{cn|date=July 2018}}\n\n==Honours and awards==\n\nGelovani received a total of 37 awards, including the following:{{cn|date=July 2018}}\n\n* [[Order of Lenin]]\n* [[Order of the Patriotic War]], 1st class\n* [[Order of the Red Banner of Labour]]\n* [[Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union]]\n* [[Order of the Red Star]], twice\n* [[Order for Service to the Homeland in the Armed Forces of the USSR]], 3rd class\n* [[People's Architect of the USSR]]\n* [[Medal \"For the Defence of Sevastopol\"]]\n* [[Medal \"For the Defence of Odessa\"]]\n* [[Medal \"For the Defence of the Caucasus\"]]\n* [[Order for Service to the Homeland in the Armed Forces of the USSR]]\n* [[Order of the Badge of Honour]]\n* [[Order of the October Revolution]]\n* [[Order of Labour Glory]]\n* [[Medal \"For Courage\" (Russia)]]\n* [[Medal \"For Impeccable Service\"]], all classes\n* [[Medal \"Veteran of the Armed Forces of the USSR\"]]\n* [[Medal \"For Labour Valour\"]]\n* [[Jubilee Medal \"Twenty Years of Victory in the Great Patriotic War 1941-1945\"]]\n* [[Jubilee Medal \"Thirty Years of Victory in the Great Patriotic War 1941-1945\"]]\n* [[Jubilee Medal \"30 Years of the Soviet Army and Navy\"]]\n* [[Jubilee Medal \"40 Years of the Armed Forces of the USSR\"]]\n* [[Jubilee Medal \"50 Years of the Armed Forces of the USSR\"]]\n* [[Lenin Prize]] (1968)\n* [[Jubilee Medal \"In Commemoration of the 100th Anniversary since the Birth of Vladimir Il'ich Lenin\"]]\n* [[USSR State Prize]] (1977)\n* Honoured Builder of the RSFSR (1971)\n* numerous foreign awards\n\n== References ==\n\n*{{in lang|ru}} [https://archive.is/20070808014724/http://www.cultinfo.ru/fulltext/1/001/008/009/178.htm \u0413\u0435\u043b\u043e\u0432\u0430\u043d\u0438, \u0410\u0440\u0447\u0438\u043b \u0412\u0438\u043a\u0442\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0447 (Gelovani, Archil Viktorovich)], in: ''[[Great Soviet Encyclopedia]]''\n*{{in lang|ru}} Vladimir Galaiko, [https://web.archive.org/web/20090630025239/http://www.vpk-news.ru/article.asp?pr_sign=archive.2005.111.articles.army_01 \u041c\u0430\u0440\u0448\u0430\u043b-\u0441\u043e\u0437\u0438\u0434\u0430\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c (Marshal-Constructor),] ''Voenno-Promyshlenny Kuryer'' #44 (111), 23\u201329 November 2005\n\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Gelovani, Archil}}\n[[Category:1915 births]]\n[[Category:1978 deaths]]\n[[Category:People from Racha-Lechkhumi and Kvemo Svaneti]]\n[[Category:People from Kutais Governorate]]\n[[Category:Svan people]]\n[[Category:People of World War II from Georgia (country)]]\n[[Category:Generals from Georgia (country)]]\n[[Category:Soviet Georgian generals]]\n[[Category:Soviet military personnel of World War II]]\n[[Category:Recipients of the Order of Lenin]]\n[[Category:Recipients of the Order of the Patriotic War, 1st class]]\n[[Category:Lenin Prize winners]]\n[[Category:Recipients of the USSR State Prize]]\n[[Category:Soviet Marshals of Engineer Troops]]\n", "name_user": "Bellowhead678", "label": "safe", "comment": "Archill->Archil -Fix a typo in one click", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archil_Gelovani"}

Since the [[Middle Ages]], the Holy Roman Empire had been recognized by [[Western Europe]]ans as the legitimate continuation of the ancient [[Roman Empire]] due to its emperors having been proclaimed as [[Roman emperors]] by the [[Papacy]]. Through this Roman legacy, the Holy Roman Emperors claimed to be [[Universal monarchy|universal monarchs]] whose jurisdiction extended beyond their empire's formal borders to all of [[Christianity|Christian]] Europe and beyond. The formation of the first modern [[Sovereign state|sovereign territorial states]] in the 16th and 17th centuries, which brought with it the idea that jurisdiction corresponded to actual territory governed, threatened the universal nature of the Holy Roman Empire. \n\nThe Holy Roman Empire by the time of the 18th century was widely regarded by contemporaries, both inside and outside the empire, as a highly \"irregular\" monarchy and \"sick\", having a \"unusual\" form of government. The empire lacked both a central standing army and a central treasury and its monarchs, formally elective rather than hereditary, could not exercise effective central control. Even then, most contemporaries believed that the empire could be revived and restored to glory. The Holy Roman Empire did not experience its true terminal decline before its involvement in the [[French Revolutionary Wars]] and the [[Napoleonic Wars]]. \n\nAlthough the empire defended itself quite well initially, war with France and [[Napoleon]] proved catastrophic. In 1804, Napoleon proclaimed himself as the [[Emperor of the French]], which Francis II responded to by proclaiming himself the [[Emperor of Austria]], in addition to already being the Holy Roman Emperor, an attempt at maintaining parity between France and Austria while also illustrating that the Holy Roman title outranked them both. Austria's defeat at the [[Battle of Austerlitz]] in December 1805 and the secession of a large number of Francis II's German vassals in July 1806 to form the [[Confederation of the Rhine]], a French [[satellite state]], effectively meant the end of the Holy Roman Empire. The abdication in August 1806, combined with a dissolution of the entire imperial hierarchy and its institutions, was seen as necessary to prevent the possibility of Napoleon proclaiming himself as Holy Roman Emperor, something which would have reduced Francis II to Napoleon's vassal. \n\nReactions to the empire's dissolution ranged from indifference to despair. The populace of [[Vienna]], capital of the [[Habsburg Monarchy]], were horrified at the loss of the empire. Many of Francis II's former subjects questioned the legality of his actions; though his abdication was agreed to be perfectly legal, the dissolution of the empire and the release of all its vassals were seen as beyond the emperor's authority. As such, many of the empire's princes and subjects refused to accept that the empire was gone, with some commoners going so far as to believe that news of its dissolution was a plot by their local authorities. In Germany, the dissolution was widely compared to the ancient and semi-legendary [[Fall of Troy]] and some associated the end of the Roman Empire with the [[End time|end times]] and the [[apocalypse]].\n\n== Background ==\n{{See also|Holy Roman Empire#History|Problem of two emperors}}\n\n=== Ideology of the Holy Roman Empire ===\n[[File:Wien-khm-kunstkammer-francis1-0.jpg|left|thumb|Marble bust of the final [[Holy Roman Emperor]], [[Francis II, Holy Roman Emperor|Francis II]], in a style inspired by ancient Roman marble busts.]]\nThe defining characteristic of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] was the idea that the [[Holy Roman Emperor]] represented the leading monarch in Europe and that their empire was the one true continuation of the [[Roman Empire]] of [[Classical antiquity|Antiquity]], through proclamation by the [[Popes]] in [[Rome]]. It was the firm belief of its emperors that they were the sole genuine emperors in Europe and although they had formally recognized the rulers of [[Russian Empire|Russia]] as emperors in 1606 and the sultans of the [[Ottoman Empire]] as emperors in 1721, these recognitions were conditional on the fact that the Holy Roman Emperor was always pre-eminent.{{Sfn|Wilson|2009|p=25}} The pre-eminence of the emperor was an expression of the idea that the Holy Roman Empire, theoretically, extended over all [[Christians]] in a universal manner. Because the empire at no point ruled over all of Christian Europe, this idea was always an ideal rather than a reality. Imperial authority rested not on the emperor's own crown lands (though there were large crown lands in the 18th and 19th centuries) but on the emperor's role as the highest secular ruler in the world and a champion and advocate of the [[Catholic Church]]. The lack of a defined capital and consistent crown lands reinforced the idea that the imperial title was universal as it was not necessarily associated with any one area.{{Sfn|Wilson|2009|p=27}} \n\nThroughout its long existence, the Holy Roman Empire was a central element in international relations in Europe, not only because the empire itself was often one of the most powerful on the continent but also because of the emperor himself. Because the Holy Roman Emperors were the internationally recognized heirs of the old Roman emperors and the foremost Christian rulers, they claimed (and were often granted) precedence over other rulers.{{Sfn|Wilson|2006|p=709}}\n\nAlthough the emperors had been formally titled as \"Elected Roman Emperor\" since 1508, when Emperor [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor|Maximilian I]] took the title without the need for a Papal coronation, the universalist character of the empire was sustained through the emperor's [[Feudalism|feudal]] authority extending beyond just the institutions that had been developed within the formal imperial borders. Imperial territories held by rulers of other realms remained imperial vassals. For instance, the kings of both [[Sweden]] and [[Denmark]] accepted vassalage in regards to their German lands until 1806, when these lands were formally incorporated into their kingdoms.{{Sfn|Wilson|2009|p=27}} The [[Reformation]] of the 16th century had made managing the empire more difficult and made its role as \"holy\" questionable. Despite [[Lutheranism]] and [[Calvinism]] being tolerated from 1555 and 1648 onwards respectively, Catholicism remained the only recognized faith. Even then, the [[Imperial Church System|Imperial Church]] diminished from the 16th century onwards, only [[Electorate of Mainz|Mainz]] surviving as a ecclesiastical territory by 1803. The \"holy\" nature of the empire became even more questionable when the possibility of permanent peace with the Ottoman Empire, widely seen as the mortal enemies of Christian Europe, was accepted through the 1699 [[Treaty of Karlowitz|Peace of Karlowitz]].{{Sfn|Wilson|2009|p=28}}\n\nBoth the Papacy and the Holy Roman Empire continued to claim their traditional rights of universal jurisdiction into the early modern period, that it was their reight to exercise jurisdiction throughout the entire world, even if they did not have ''de facto'' control over particular territories.{{Sfn|Orford|2009|p=981}} Conjointly with the Papacy, the Holy Roman Empire represented the recognized centre of the Christian world, and one of the pillars upon which it rested. It was always its influence and its place in the recognized world order that gave the Holy Roman Empire its true power, rather than the actual extent of its territorial domains.{{Sfn|Bryce|1864|p=2}}\n\nOne of the greatest threats to the traditional (and theoretical) universal jurisdiction accorded to the Holy Roman Emperor and the Pope throughout the Christian world was the emergence of modern [[Sovereign state|sovereign territorial states]] in the 16th and 17th centuries, which meant the rise of the idea that jurisdiction was the same thing as direct control of territory.{{Sfn|Orford|2009|p=981}} To the rulers of territorial states, both the Papacy and the Holy Roman Empire represented \"universal antagonists\", claiming that jurisdiction over all the world was theirs by right through their connection to [[Ancient Rome]]. Ambitious emperors, such as [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]] ({{Reign}}1519\u20131556) and [[Ferdinand II, Holy Roman Emperor|Ferdinand II]] ({{Reign}}1619\u20131637), who sought to combine universal jurisdiction with actual universal temporal rule and universal imperial authority, represented threats to the continued existence of the countries of Europe.{{Sfn|Orford|2009|p=989}}\n\n=== The Holy Roman Empire in the 18th century ===\n[[File:Map of the Holy Roman Empire, 1789 en.png|thumb|The [[Holy Roman Empire]] and its internal subdivisions and vassals in 1789.]]\n\nBy the 18th century, the contemporary views of the Holy Roman Empire were far from universally positive. There was a widespread idea that the empire was \"sick\" in some capacity, for instance the bookseller and publisher [[Johann Heinrich Zedler]] mentions the \"state illnesses of the Holy Roman Empire\" in his 1745 ''[[Grosses Universal-Lexicon]]''. This view dates back to at least the [[Peace of Westphalia]] at the conclusion of the [[Thirty Years' War]] in 1648, where the empire was explicitly defined as not being a [[nation state]]. The 17th century historian [[Samuel von Pufendorf]] famously described the empire as having a \"unusual form of government\" and derided it as a \"monstrosity\", lacking what was required for an effective and functional state. The lack of a standing army, a central treasury, weak central control exercised by a monarch who was elective and not hereditary all contributed to the idea that there was no unified German state. In the view of its contemporaries, the empire had regressed from a \"regular\" monarchy into a highly irregular one.{{Sfn|Wilson|2009|p=23}}\n\nAlthough some German romantics and nationalists argued that the empire had to die for Germany to be reborn, a large number of imperial subjects had not given up hope that the \"sick\" empire might be cured and revived. The first few years of the 19th century saw extensive reorganizations and changes in power within the empire, with the 1801 [[Peace of Lun\u00e9ville]] with France meaning the end of imperial jurisdiction in the Netherlands and Italy, and the rise of powerful German rulers in the north, such as the Kings of [[Prussia]], causing the consolidation of many previously separate imperial vassals and fiefs into the hands of a few rulers. The traditional political hierarchy of the empire was disrupted, but it was not obvious to contemporaries that this was to lead to the empire's downfall, the general view was that it represented a new beginning rather than the last few steps towards an ending.{{Sfn|Wilson|2009|p=24}} Furthermore, many publicists within the empire did not see its nature as a \"irregular\" monarchy as something negative and were unconcerned with forming a new political or social order, but rather sought to augment the already present structures to create a better future. The Peace of Westphalia had explicitly designated that the empire was to remain non-aligned and passive and that it was to work to maintain peace in Europe, an arrangement approved of by most of its inhabitants.{{Sfn|Wilson|2009|p=28}}\n\nDespite the widespread idea that the Holy Roman Empire was \"sick\", the empire was not in terminal decline before its involvement in the [[French Revolutionary Wars]] from the 1790s onwards. In the 18th century, imperial institutions were experiencing something akin to a renaissance. The empire represented to safest and best guarantee for the rights of smaller states and territories in a time when Europe was beginning to be dominated by powerful imperial nation states. Because of the weak central government, the constituent territories of the empire could influence their own fates, the central [[Imperial Diet (Holy Roman Empire)|Reichstag]] decided policy and legislation and allowed the empire to coordinate its response to the threat represented by France and the two separate imperial supreme courts and the imperial circles represented successful venues for resolving inter-imperial conflicts.{{Sfn|Wilson|2009|p=25}} The Reichstag also worked as a place where weaker imperial princes could work to convince their more powerful counterparts to remain at peace and resolve their differences.{{Sfn|Wilson|2009|p=28}}\n\n== Wars with France and Napoleon ==\n\n=== Austrian war effort and responses ===\n[[File:Bataille de Fleurus 1794.JPG|left|thumb|''Battle of Fleurus'' by [[Jean-Baptiste Mauzaisse]] (1837). The [[Battle of Fleurus (1794)|Battle of Fleurus]] in 1794 saw the French defeat the [[Habsburg Monarchy]], the [[Dutch Republic]], [[Electorate of Hanover|Hanover]] and [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Great Britain]] and led to the permanent loss of the [[Austrian Netherlands]] and the Dutch Republic.]]\nAlthough the forces of the [[French First Republic]] overran and occupied the Netherlands in 1792, the Holy Roman Empire was defending itself quite well until Prussia abandoned the war effort to focus its attention on its Polish territories (overseeing the [[Second Partition of Poland|Second]] and [[Third Partition of Poland|Third Partitions of Poland]]), taking the resources and military strength of northern Germany with it.{{Sfn|Wilson|2009|p=25}} Despite the empire's mounting difficulties in the face of the wars with France, there was no large-scale popular unrest within its borders. Instead, the explanation for the end of the Holy Roman Empire lies in the realm of high politics. The empire's defeat in the Revolutionary Wars was the most decisive step in the gradual undermining of the empire.{{Sfn|Wilson|2006|p=712}} The conflict between France and the Holy Roman Empire had begun with the French declaring war on the newly crowned Emperor [[Francis II, Holy Roman Emperor|Francis II]] of the [[Habsburg Dynasty|Habsburg dynasty]] only in his capacity as the [[King of Hungary]], the fact that much of the wider empire (including influential figures such as the King of Prussia and the [[Archbishop-Elector of Mainz]]), however unwilling, joined the conflict on the side of the Habsburgs proves that imperial ideals were still alive by the late 18th century.{{Sfn|Wilson|2006|p=713}}\n\nThe key point in which fortunes shifted was Prussia's abandonment of the war effort. Prussia had been the only true counterweight to Austria's influence in the institutions of the empire. Though the western parts of Prussia, such as Brandenburg, remained formal parts of the Holy Roman Empire and the Prussians continued to be represented in the Reichstag, Prussia ceased to compete for influence in imperial affairs. Austria stood alone as the protector of the states in southern Germany, many of which began considering making their own separate peaces with France. When the Austrians learnt that [[Duchy of W\u00fcrttemberg|W\u00fcrttemberg]] and [[Margraviate of Baden|Baden]] had opened formal negotiations with France, the armies sent by these two states were disbanded and disarmed in 1796, causing resentment against the emperor and, combined with losses to France, suggesting that the Habsburg emperor was no longer capable of protecting his traditional vassals in Germany.{{Sfn|Wilson|2006|p=714}}\n\nIn the wake of the wars with France, there was a substantial reorganization of Imperial territory (the so-called ''[[Reichsdeputationshauptschluss]]'', supported by Prussia), with the [[Habsburg Monarchy]] meaning to compensate those princes who had lost territory in the French wars and effectivize the empire's current semi-feudal structure. Although there were huge territorial changes, notably the almost complete abolition of any church territory and significant territorial gains for [[Electorate of Bavaria|Bavaria]], Baden, W\u00fcrttemberg, [[Landgraviate of Hesse-Darmstadt|Hesse-Darmstadt]] and [[County of Nassau|Nassau]], the most important changes were in the empire's electoral college. [[Electorate of Salzburg|Salzburg]] was added as a fourth Catholic elector, while [[Electorate of W\u00fcrttemberg|W\u00fcrttemberg]], [[Electorate of Baden|Baden]] and [[Electorate of Hesse|Hesse-Kassel]] became the fourth, fifth and sixth Protestant electors, given the Protestants a majority for the first time in history and raising doubts whether Emperor Francis II would be able to work together with his Reichstag. Although the Austrian regime spent much time and resources attempting to make the new arrangement work, the general verdict at the time was that the reorganization had essentially killed the empire.{{Sfn|Wilson|2006|p=|pp=719\u2013720}}\n\n=== Reaction to Napoleon's imperial coronation ===\n[[File:Jacques-Louis David - The Coronation of Napoleon (1805-1807).jpg|thumb|''[[The Coronation of Napoleon]]'' by [[Jacques-Louis David]] (1807). [[Napoleon|Napoleon Bonaparte]] incorporated many traditional imperial symbols and traditions into his 1804 [[Coronation of Napoleon I|coronation]] as [[Emperor of the French]], some deriving from the [[Holy Roman Empire]] and some deriving from [[Ancient Rome]].]]\n\nThe head of the French republic, [[Napoleon]], assumed the title \"[[Empire of the French]]\" in 1804. This act received a mixed reaction in the Holy Roman Empire. Although a return to monarchy in France was welcomed (though unfortunate in so far that the monarch was Napoleon), the imperial title (instead of a royal one) was not.{{Sfn|Wilson|2006|p=723}} In the empire, Napoleon's title raised fears that it might inspire the Russian Emperor to insist that he was equal to the Holy Roman Emperor and might encourage other monarchs, such as [[George III of the United Kingdom|George III]] of the [[United Kingdom]], to also proclaim themselves emperors.{{Sfn|Wilson|2009|p=26}} The Habsburg diplomat [[Ludwig von Cobenzl]], fearing the consequences of Napoleon's coronation, is quoted as having advised Holy Roman Emperor Francis II that \"\u2018as Roman Emperor, Your Majesty has enjoyed till now precedence ahead of all European potentates, including the Russian emperor\".{{Sfn|Wilson|2009|p=25}}\n\nThough Napoleon's imperial title was viewed with distaste, Austrian officials immediately realized that if they were to refuse to accept him as an emperor, war with France would be renewed. Instead, the focus became on how to accept Napoleon as an emperor while still maintaining the pre-eminence of their own emperor and empire.{{Sfn|Wilson|2006|p=723}} France had officially accepted parity with [[Archduchy of Austria|Austria]] as a distinct state in 1757, 1797 and 1801 and in the same settlements accepted that the Holy Roman Empire outranked both Austria and France. Thus, it was decided that Austria would be raised to the rank of an empire in order to maintain the parity between Austria and France while still preserving the Roman imperial title as pre-eminent, outranking both.{{Sfn|Wilson|2009|p=26}}\n\n=== Empire of Austria ===\n[[File:Imperial Crown of Austria (Vienna).JPG|thumb|The [[Imperial Crown of Austria]] (pictured) was the personal crown originally made for Emperor [[Rudolf II, Holy Roman Emperor|Rudolf II]] ({{Reign}}1576\u20131612) of the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. The traditional crown of the Holy Roman Emperors, the ''[[Reichskrone]]'', ceased being used in 1806, but Rudolf's crown was used until the end of the [[Habsburg Monarchy]] in the 20th century.]]\nFrancis II proclaimed himself as [[Emperor of Austria]] (without the need of a new coronation, as he had already had an imperial coronation) on 11 August 1804, in addition to already being the Holy Roman Emperor.{{Sfn|Wilson|2009|p=26}} Cobenzl advised that a separate hereditary Austrian title would also allow the Habsburg to maintain parity with other rulers (since the Holy Roman title was viewed by Cobenzl as merely honorific) and ensure elections to the position of Holy Roman Emperor in the future.{{Sfn|Wilson|2006|p=723}} A myriad of reasons were used to justify the Austrian Empire's creation, including the number of subjects under the Habsburg Monarchy, the vast extent of his crown lands and the long association between the Habsburg family and the elective Holy Roman imperial title. Another important point used to justify its creation was that Francis was, in the traditional sense, the supreme Christian monarch and he was thus entitled to award himself with any dignities he wished.{{Sfn|Wilson|2009|p=31}} The title \"Emperor of Austria\" was meant to associate with all of Francis II's personal domains (not just Austria, but also lands such as [[Bohemia]] and [[Hungary]]), regardless of their current position within or outside the Holy Roman Empire. \"Austria\" in this sense referred to the dynasty (often officially called the \"House of Austria\" instead of the \"House of Habsburg\"), not the geographical location.{{Sfn|Wilson|2009|p=32}} \n\nThe title of Holy Roman Emperor remained pre-eminent to both \"Emperor of the French\" and \"Emperor of Austria\" as it embodied the traditional ideal of the universal Christian empire. Neither the Austrian nor the French title made claims to govern this universal empire and thus did not disturb the traditional and established world order.{{Sfn|Wilson|2006|p=723}} The imperial titles of Austria and France were seen as more or less royal titles (as they were hereditary) and in the minds of the Austrians, there still remained only one true empire and one true emperor in Europe. To illustrate this, Francis II's official imperial title read \"elected Roman Emperor, ever Augustus, hereditary Emperor of Austria\", placing the Austrian title behind the Roman title.{{Sfn|Wilson|2009|p=26}}\n\nFrancis II stated that he would only recognize Napoleon as the Emperor of the French if Napoleon in turn recognized him as the Emperor of Austria and though Napoleon was reluctant to tie his own imperial title to any concessions, he needed recognition from the Habsburgs to secure wider recognition throughout Europe and thus agreed to recognize Francis II's new title. George III of the United Kingdom recognized the new title in October and although Russian Emperor [[Alexander I of Russia|Alexander I]] objected to Francis \"lowering himself to the level of the usurper Napoleon\", he recognized the title in November. The only significant objections to Francis II's title were raised by Sweden, who through holding [[Swedish Pomerania]], an [[Imperial Estate]], had a place in the Reichstag. The Swedes saw the title as a \"clear breach\" of the imperial constitution and demanded a formal debate in the Reichstag, a threat that was neutralized by the other parties of the Reichstag agreeing to an extended summer recesses until November.{{Sfn|Wilson|2006|p=725}} To defend the title, imperial representatives argued that it did not infringe on the imperial constitution as there were already other examples of dual monarchies within the empire, states such as Prussia and Sweden were not part of the empire, but their possessions within the empire were.{{Sfn|Wilson|2006|p=726}}\n\n=== Peace of Pressburg ===\n[[File:Austerlitz-baron-Pascal.jpg|thumb|''Napol\u00e9on at the Battle of Austerlitz'' by [[Fran\u00e7ois G\u00e9rard]] (1810). The [[Battle of Austerlitz]] in 1805 saw the [[First French Empire|French Empire]] defeat both the [[Holy Roman Empire]] and the [[Russian Empire]] and allowed French dominion to extend into Germany.|alt=]]\nThe [[War of the Third Coalition]] came too soon for Austria, which moved against France in September 1805. Defeated at the [[Battle of Austerlitz]] on 2 December 1805, Austria had to accept terms dictated by Napoleon in the [[Peace of Pressburg (1805)|Peace of Pressburg]] (26 December). These created deliberate ambiguities in the imperial constitution. [[Electorate of Bavaria|Bavaria]], [[Electorate of Baden|Baden]] and [[Electorate of W\u00fcrttemberg|W\u00fcrttemberg]] were granted ''pl\u00e9nitude de la souverainet\u00e9'' (full sovereignty) while remaining a part of the ''Conf\u00e9deration Germanique'' (Germanic Confederation), a novel name for the Holy Roman Empire.{{sfn|Whaley|2012|pp=634\u2013635}} Likewise, it was left deliberately unclear whether the [[Duchy of Cleves]], the [[Grand Duchy of Berg|Duchy of Berg]] and the [[County of Mark]]\u2014imperial territories transferred to [[Joachim Murat]]\u2014were to remain imperial fiefs or become part of the French Empire. As late as March 1806, Napoleon was uncertain whether they should remain nominally within the Empire.{{sfn|Whaley|2012|p=636}}\n\nThe [[Free Imperial Knights]], who had survived the attack on their rights in ''[[Rittersturm]]'' of 1803\u201304, were subject to a second attack and a spate of annexations by those states allied to Napoleon in November\u2013December 1805. In response, the knights' corporation (''corpus equestre'') dissolved itself on 20 January 1806. With the dissolution of the Empire, the knights ceased to be either free or imperial and were at the mercy of the newly sovereign states.{{sfn|Whaley|2012|p=636}}{{sfn|Godsey|2004|p=145}}\n\nContemporaries saw the defeat at Austerlitz as a turning point of world-historical significance. The Peace of Pressburg, too, was perceived as radical shift. It did not affirm previous treaties in the usual way and its wording seemed to raise Bavaria, Baden and W\u00fcrttemberg into equals of the empire while downgrading the latter to a merely German confederation.{{sfn|Whaley|2012|pp=634\u2013635}} Nevertheless, Bavaria and W\u00fcrttemberg reaffirmed to the Reichstag that they were subject to imperial law. Some commentators argued that ''pl\u00e9nitude de la souverainet\u00e9'' was just a French translation of ''[[Landeshoheit]]'' (the quasi-sovereignty possessed by imperial estates) and the treaty had not altered the relationship between the members and the empire.{{sfn|Whaley|2012|p=637}}\n\n== Formation of the Confederation of the Rhine ==\nThroughout the first half of 1806, Bavaria, Baden and W\u00fcrttemberg attempted to steer an independent course between the demands of the empire and Napoleon. In April 1806, Napoleon sought a treaty whereby the three states would ally themselves to France in perpetuity while forswearing participation in future ''[[Reichskrieg]]e'' (imperial war efforts) and submitting to a ''commission de m\u00e9ditation'' under his presidency to resolve their disputes. Despite all of this, they were to remain members of the empire. W\u00fcrttemberg ultimately refused to sign.{{sfn|Whaley|2012|p=637}}\n\nIn June 1806, Napoleon began pressuring Bavaria, Baden and W\u00fcrttemberg for the creation of ''conf\u00e9d\u00e9ration de la haute Allemagne'' (Upper German confederation) outside the empire.{{sfn|Whaley|2012|p=637}} On 12 July 1806, these three states and thirteen other minor German princes formed the [[Confederation of the Rhine]], effectively a French [[satellite state]].{{Sfn|Wilson|2009|p=33}} On 1 August, the Reichstag was informed by a French envoy that Napoleon no longer recognized the existence of the Holy Roman Empire and on the same day, nine of the princes who had formed the Confederation of the Rhine issued a proclamation in which they justified their actions by claiming that the Holy Roman Empire had already collapsed and ceased to function due to the defeat in the Battle of Austerlitz.{{Sfn|Wilson|2009|p=33}}\n\n== Abdication of Francis II ==\n[[File:P\u00f6rtr\u00e4t_Kaiser_Franz_I_von_\u00d6sterreich.jpg|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:P%C3%B6rtr%C3%A4t_Kaiser_Franz_I_von_%C3%96sterreich.jpg|alt=|thumb|[[Francis II, Holy Roman Emperor|Francis I]] as [[Austrian Emperor]], ''undated'', [[Salzburg Museum]]]]\nIn the face of Napoleon's assumption of the title \"Emperor of the French\" in 1804 and the Austrian defeat at the Battle of Austerlitz in 1805, the Habsburg Monarchy began contemplating whether the imperial title and the empire as a whole were worth defending. Many of the states nominally serving the Holy Roman Emperor, such as Baden, W\u00fcrttemberg and Bavaria, had openly defied imperial authority and sided with Napoleon. Even then, the significance of the empire was not based on actual control of resources, but on prestige.{{Sfn|Wilson|2009|p=25}}\n\nThe main idea behind Francis II's actions in 1806 was to lay the groundwork needed to avoid additional future wars with Napoleon and France.{{Sfn|Wilson|2009|p=30}} One concern held by the Habsburg Monarchy was that Napoleon might aspire to claim the title of Holy Roman Emperor.{{Sfn|Wilson|2009|p=33}} Napoleon was attracted to [[Charlemagne]]'s legacy; replicas of Charlemagne's crown and sword had been made for (but not used during) Napoleon's coronation as Emperor of the French and he conciously revived Roman imperial symbols and aspired to create a new order in Europe, something akin to the universal dominion implicit in the title of Emperor of the Romans. Napoleon's vision of Charlemagne was completely different from the German vision of the old emperor, however. Instead of seeing Charlemagne as a German king, Napoleon viewed him as a [[Franks|Frankish]] conqueror who had extended French rule across Central Europe and Italy, something Napoleon aspired to accomplish as well.{{Sfn|Wilson|2009|p=34}} Despite his fixation on Charlemagne, there is no evidence that Napoleon aspired to become Holy Roman Emperor.{{Sfn|Wilson|2006|p=727}}\n\nAustria was slow to respond to the fast pace of events. Already on the 17 June, Francis had taken the decision to abdicate at the moment that seemed best for Austria. [[Klemens von Metternich]] was sent on a mission to Paris to discern Napoleon's intentions. On 22 July, Napoleon made them clear. He issued an ultimatum demanding that Francis abdicated by 10 August.{{sfn|Whaley|2012|pp=643\u2013644}} Still, as late as 2 August, Joseph Haas, the head of the principal commission's secretariat, hoped that the end of the Holy Roman Empire might yet be averted.{{Sfn|Wilson|2006|p=730}} The general opinion among the Austrian high command was however that abdication was inevitable and that it should be combined with a dissolution of the Holy Roman Empire through relieving the vassals of the emperor of their duties and obligations. A formal dissolution of the empire was perceived as necessary, as it would prevent Napoleon from acquiring the imperial title. During an interregnum, the two [[Imperial vicar|imperial vicars]] [[Electorate of Saxony|Saxony]] and Bavaria would be entitled to exercise imperial authority and since both were aligned with Napoleon, such an arrangement could cause an abdicated Francis (as only Emperor of Austria) to become a vassal of Napoleon (as Holy Roman Emperor). More crucially, the abdication was also intended to buy time for Austria to recover from its losses as it was assumed that France would meet it with some concessions.{{Sfn|Wilson|2006|p=731}} Although the Roman title and the tradition of a universal Christian monarchy were still considered prestigious and a worthy heritage, they were now also considered things of the past. With the Holy Roman Empire dissolved, Francis II could focus his attention on the continued rise and prosperity of his new hereditary empire, as Emperor Francis I of Austria.{{Sfn|Wilson|2009|p=31}}\n\nOn the morning of 6 August 1806, the imperial herald of the Holy Roman Empire rode from the [[Hofburg]] to the Jesuit Church of the Nine Choirs of Angels (both being located in [[Vienna]], the capital of the Habsburg Monarchy), where he delivered Francis II's official proclamation from a balcony overlooking a large square. Written copies of the proclamation were dispatched to the diplomats of the Habsburg monarchy on 11 August alongside a note which informed former princes of the empire that Austria would compensate those who had been paid from the imperial treasury.{{Sfn|Wilson|2006|p=731}} The abdication did not acknowledge the French ultimatum, but stressed the interpretation of the Peace of Pressburg by the imperial estates made it impossible for Francis to fulfill the obligations he had undertaken in his [[electoral capitulation]].{{sfn|Whaley|2012|pp=643\u2013644}}\n\nHoly Roman Emperors had abdicated before\u2014the most notable example being the abdication of Charles V in 1558\u2014but Francis II's abdication was unique. While previous abdications had returned the imperial crown to the electors so that they may proclaim a new emperor, Francis II's abdication simultaneously dissolved the empire itself so that there were no more electors.{{Sfn|Wilson|2006|p=732}}\n\n== Aftermath ==\n\n=== Reactions ===\n[[File:Sarcophagus Emperor Franz II.(I.)

The dissolution of the empire sent shockwaves through Germany, with most of the reactions within the former imperial boundaries were reactions of rage, grief or shame. Even the signatories of the Confederation of the Rhine were outraged; the Bavarian emissary to the imperial diet, Rechberg, stated that he was \"furious\" due to having \"put his signature to the destruction of the German name\", referring to his state's involvement in the confederation, which had effectively doomed the empire.{{Sfn|Burgdorf|2012|p=52}} From a legal standpoint, Francis II's abdication was controversial. Contemporary legal commentators agreed that the abdication itself was perfectly legal but that the emperor did not have the authority to dissolve the empire.{{Sfn|Wilson|2006|p=733}} As such, several of the empire's vassals refused to recognize that the empire had ended.{{sfn|Gagliardo|1980|p=281}} As late as October 1806, farmers in [[Thuringia]] refused to accept the end of the empire, believing its dissolution to be a plot by the local authorities.{{Sfn|Burgdorf|2012|p=52}} For many of the people within the former empire, its collapse made them uncertain and fearful of their future, and the future of Germany itself.{{Sfn|Burgdorf|2012|p=55}} Contemporary reports from Vienna describe the dissolution of the empire as \"incomprehensible\" and the general public's reaction as one of horror.{{Sfn|Burgdorf|2012|p=58}}\n\nIn contrast to the fears of the general public, many contemporary intellectuals and artists saw Napoleon as a herald of a new age, rather than a destroyer of an old order.{{Sfn|Wilson|2006|p=734}} The popular idea forwarded by German nationalists was that the final collapse of the Holy Roman Empire freed Germany from the somewhat anachronistic ideas rooted in a fading ideal of universal Christianity and paved the way for the country's unification as the [[German Empire]], a nation state, 65 years later.{{Sfn|Wilson|2009|p=23}} German historian Helmut R\u00f6ssler has argued that Francis II and the Austrians fought to save the largely ungrateful Germany from the forces of Napoleon, only withdrawing and abandoning the empire when most of Germany betrayed them and joined Napoleon.{{Sfn|Wilson|2006|p=711}} Indeed, the assumption of a separate Austrian imperial title in 1804 did not mean that Francis II had any intentions to abdicate his prestigious position as the Roman emperor, the idea only began to be considered as circumstances beyond Habsburg control forced decisive actions to be taken.{{Sfn|Wilson|2006|p=726}}\n\nCompounded with fears of what now guaranteed the safety of many of the smaller German states, the poet [[Christoph Martin Wieland]] lamented that Germany had now fallen into an \"apocalyptic time\" and stating \"Who can bear this disgrace, which weighs down upon a nation which was once so glorious?\u2014may God improve things, if it is still possible to improve them!\".{{Sfn|Burgdorf|2012|p=59}} To some, the dissolution of the Holy Roman Empire was seen as the final end of the ancient Roman Empire. In the words of Christian Gottlob von Voigt, a minister in [[Weimar]], \"if poetry can go hand in hand with politics, then the abdication of the imperial dignity offers a wealth of material. The Roman Empire now takes its place in the sequence of vanquished empires\".{{Sfn|Burgdorf|2012|p=56}} In the words of the English historian [[James Bryce, 1st Viscount Bryce]] in his 1864 work on the Holy Roman Empire, the empire was the \"oldest political institution in the world\" and the same institution as the one founded by [[Augustus]] in 27 BC. Writing of the empire, Bryce stated that \"nothing else so directly linked the old world to the new\u2014nothing else displayed so many strange contrasts of the present and the past, and summed up in those contrasts so much of European history\".{{Sfn|Bryce|1864|p=2}} When confronted by the fall and collapse of their empire, many contemporaries employed the catastrophic [[Trojan War|fall of ancient Troy]] as a metaphor, due to its association with the notion of total destruction and the end of a culture.{{Sfn|Burgdorf|2012|p=|pp=60\u201361}} The image of the [[Apocalyptic literature|apocalypse]] was also frequently used, associating the collapse of the Holy Roman Empire with an impending end of the world (echoing medieval legends of a [[Last Roman Emperor]], a figure prophesized to be active during the [[End time|end times]]).{{Sfn|Burgdorf|2012|p=63}}\n[[File:Johann Philipp Palm-Denkmal von Konrad Knoll in Braunau am Inn.jpg|thumb|1866 statue of [[Johann Philipp Palm]] by [[Konrad Knoll]] in [[Braunau am Inn]]. Palm was executed on 26 August 1806 on [[Napoleon]]'s orders due to advocating for saving the [[Holy Roman Empire]].]]\nProtests and criticism against the empire's dissolution was typically censored, especially in the French-administrated Confederation of the Rhine. Among the aspects most criticized by the general populace was the removal or replacement of the traditional intercessions for the empire and emperor in the daily church prayers throughout former imperial territory. Suppression from France, combined with individual examples of sensational retribution against pro-empire advocates ensured that these protests soon died down.{{Sfn|Burgdorf|2012|p=64}} In particular, few dared to voice their lament and criticism directly after the French executed the Nuremberg book dealer [[Johann Philipp Palm]] on 26 August after he had advocated for saving the empire.{{Sfn|Wilson|2006|p=735}}\n\nIn an official capacity, Prussia's response was only formulaic expressions of regret owing to the \"termination of an honourable bond hallowed by time\".{{Sfn|Wilson|2006|p=734}} Prussia's representative to the Reichstag, Baron G\u00f6rtz, reacted with sadness, mixed with gratitude and affection for the House of Habsburg and their former role as emperors.{{Sfn|Wilson|2006|p=735}} G\u00f6rtz had taken part as an electoral emissary of the [[Electorate of Brandenburg]] (Prussia's territory within the formal imperial borders) in 1792, at the election of Francis II as Holy Roman Emperor, and exclaimed that \"So the emperor whom I helped elect was the last emperor!\u2014This step was no doubt to be expected, but that does not make its reality any less moving and crushing. It cuts off the last thread of hope to which one tried to cling\".{{Sfn|Burgdorf|2012|p=54}} Baron von Wiessenberg, the Austrian envoy to the Electorate of Hesse-Kassel, reported that the local elector, [[William I, Elector of Hesse|William I]], had teared up and expressed lament at the loss of \"a constitution to which Germany had for so long owed its happiness and freedom\".{{Sfn|Wilson|2006|p=735}}\n\nInternationally, the empire's demise was met with mixed or indifferent reactions. Alexander I of Russia offered no response and [[Christian VII of Denmark|Christian VII]] of Denmark formally incorporated his German lands into his kingdoms a few months after the empire's dissolution. [[Gustav IV Adolf of Sweden|Gustav IV]] of Sweden (who notably hadn't recognized the separate imperial title of Austria yet) issued a somewhat provocative proclamation to the denizens of his German lands (Swedish Pomerania and [[Bremen-Verden]]) on 22 August 1806, stating that the dissolution of the Holy Roman Empire \"would not destroy the German nation\" and expressed hopes that the empire might be revived.{{Sfn|Wilson|2009|p=27}}{{Sfn|Wilson|2006|p=734}}\n\nThe dissolution of the Holy Roman Empire was constituted by Francis II's own personal abdication of the title and the release of all vassals and imperial states from their obligations and duties to the emperor.{{Sfn|Wilson|2006|p=731}} The title of Holy Roman Emperor (theoretically the same title as Roman emperor) and the Holy Roman Empire itself as an idea and institution (the theoretically universally sovereign ''imperium'') were never technically abolished. The continued existence of an universal empire, though without defined territory and lacking an emperor, was sometimes referenced in the titles of other later monarchs. For instance, the [[House of Savoy|Savoyard]] [[Kings of Italy]] continued to claim the title \"Prince and Perpetual Vicar of the Holy Roman Empire (in Italy)\" (a title originating from an 14th-century imperial grant from Emperor [[Charles IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles IV]] to their ancestor [[Amadeus VI, Count of Savoy|Amedeus VI]], [[Count of Savoy]]){{Sfn|Datta|1834|p=174}} until the abolition of the Italian monarchy in 1946.{{Sfn|Davies|2012|p=}}\n\n=== Successor empires ===\n[[File:Dual Alliance in 1914.svg|left|thumb|The [[German Empire]] (blue) and [[Austria-Hungary]] (red) in 1914. The [[House of Habsburg|Habsburg dynasty]] continued to rule as emperors in [[Austrian Empire|Austria]] and [[Kingdom of Hungary|Hungary]] after 1806, where their [[Austrian Empire]] represented a direct successor of the [[Holy Roman Empire]], retaining many of its ideals and practices. The German Empire, proclaimed in 1871, formed an ideological successor of the Holy Roman Empire, but its rulers were ill-at-ease with their imperial role and its implications.]]\nIn the [[Austrian Empire]], the Habsburg dynasty continued to act as a substitute for nationality, the Austrian imperial title was not (unlike for instance the French or Russian imperial titles) associated with any nationality in particular.{{Sfn|Wilson|2009|p=32}} Though the German vassals of the Holy Roman Empire had been released from their obligations, Francis II and his successors continued to rule a large German-speaking population and the Holy Roman imperial regalia continued to be kept within their domains (and are to this day stored and displayed at the [[Imperial Treasury, Vienna|Imperial Treasury]] at the Hofburg in Vienna). The dynasty retained its prominent status among the royal families of Europe and were in the eyes of many of their subjects still the only true imperial family.{{Sfn|Wilson|2009|p=33}} Although the new Austrian Empire lacked many of the key elements of the Holy Roman Empire, it remained close in practice and ideals to the pre-1806 empire.{{Sfn|Wilson|2009|p=36}}\n\nIn the aftermath of Francis II's abdication, the new Austrian Empire took steps to distance itself from the older empire. The symbols and formal titles of the Austrian monarchy were altered to stress Austria as a distinct entity. Because the term ''Kaiserthum Osterreich'' (Austrian Empire) had entered everyday speech, the monarchy soon dropped the original prefix \"hereditary\", which had been used from 1804 to 1806 to stress the difference between Austria and the Holy Roman Empire.{{Sfn|Wilson|2006|p=734}}\n\nIn addition to the Austrian Empire (and France under Napoleon), the most prominent potential claimant to the Holy Roman Empire's legacy (in the sense of ruling Germany) in the wake of its collapse and dissolution was the Kingdom of Prussia, ruled by the [[House of Hohenzollern]]. Alongside, the growing crown lands of the Habsburgs, Prussia represented the sole major power in Central Europe during the last century or so of Holy Roman imperial rule. It was frequently rumored that the Prussians had imperial ambitions and [[Frederick the Great|Frederick II]] of Prussia was a rumored candidate to the position of Holy Roman Emperor in 1740. Frederick II, and other Prussian kings, dismissed these ideas while they remained under imperial rule, arguing that additional territory and power would be more beneficial than the imperial title. In 1795 and again in 1803 and 1804, French representatives suggested that Prussia might convert its northern German territories into an empire, but the Hohenzollerns were not interested in going through with such a plan. Though the Prussian rulers and their officials expressed sorrow at the collapsing state of the Holy Roman Empire from 1792 onwards, they were also critical to nostalgia for Germany's history under imperial rule. The Prussians viewed the survival chances of the Holy Roman Empire as very low and saw the French as the true successors of the ancient Carolingians, an enemy which they believed could not be defeated by the normal military means.{{Sfn|Wilson|2009|p=35}} \n\nThe reluctance of the Hohenzollerns to assume an imperial title shifted in 1806 as they feared that with the formation of the Confederation of the Rhine and the dissolution of the Holy Roman Empire, Napoleon might aspire to claim the hypothetical position of \"Emperor of Germany\". Though preparations were made to create a \"imperial union\" in northern Germany, with an emperor of the Hohenzollern dynasty, these plans were dropped in September of 1806 after they found little support and Emperor Alexander I of Russia objected to the plans. Because the Hohenzollerns lacked imperial ancestry they did not see themselves as an imperial dynasty and even after Napoleon's ultimate defeats in 1813 and 1815, their position changed little. Although Germany was united into the [[German Empire]] in 1871, under the Hohenzollern emperor [[William I, German Emperor|Wilhelm I]], the proclamation of the new empire was ideologically problematic and the Hohenzollerns found themselves mostly ill-at-ease with its implications. Attempts were made to associate the German Empire with the institutions of the Holy Roman Empire, but its emperors continued to enumerate themselves after the Kings of Prussia; Emperor [[Frederick III, German Emperor|Frederick III]] ({{Reign}}1888) was enumerated after his predecessor as king, Frederick II, not after the previous imperial Frederick (Emperor [[Frederick III, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick III]] of the 15th century, the new Frederick would then have been Frederick IV).{{Sfn|Wilson|2009|p=36}}\n\nDespite the Holy Roman Empire ultimately failing in preventing war with France, the late empire's nominal role as working for peace and forming a loose sort of hegemony and partnership offered an alternative to both the universal monarchy of Napoleon's French Empire and the universal republic advocated for by Revolutionary France and it served as a model for future constitutions for international bodies and organizations.{{Sfn|Wilson|2009|p=28}}\n\n== References ==\n\n=== Citations ===\n{{Reflist|20em}}\n\n=== Bibliography ===\n{{refbegin}}\n*{{Cite book|last=Burgdorf|first=Wolfgang|url=https://books.google.se/books?id=UQkyAQAAQBAJ&pg=PA51&lpg=PA51&dq=%22%E2%80%98Once+we+were+Trojans!%E2%80%99+Contemporary+Reactions+to+the+Dissolution+of+the+Holy+Roman+Empire+of+the+German+Nation%22&source=bl&ots=nuEK5h--yj&sig=ACfU3U0PG-Y4WU8R5JSbI5bNhBZZWEm4Iw&hl=sv&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwi81s_pn7roAhX0AxAIHY9JCAEQ6AEwAnoECAkQAQ#v=onepage&q=%22%E2%80%98Once%20we%20were%20Trojans!%E2%80%99%20Contemporary%20Reactions%20to%20the%20Dissolution%20of%20the%20Holy%20Roman%20Empire%20of%20the%20German%20Nation%22&f=false|title=The Holy Roman Empire, 1495-1806: A European Perspective|publisher=Brill |year=2012|isbn=978-90-04-20683-0|editor1-last=Evans|editor1-first=Robert|location=|pages=|chapter=\u2018Once we were Trojans!\u2019 Contemporary Reactions to the Dissolution of the Holy Roman Empire of the German Nation|ref=CITEREFBurgdorf2012|editor2-last=Wilson|editor2-first=Peter H.}}\n*{{cite book|last=Bryce|first=Viscount James Bryce|title=The Holy Roman Empire|publisher=Good Press|year=2019|location=|pages=|asin=B081TFMGRC|ref=CITEREFBryce1864|orig-year=1864|url=https://books.google.se/books?id=VyfDDwAAQBAJ&pg=PT15&lpg=PT15&dq=%22Pius+VII%22+%22Holy+Roman+Empire%22&source=bl&ots=4k5-pkfIcp&sig=ACfU3U2RJtsDBSlr-H9y0ORlgZ8De7JQwg&hl=sv&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiRi_OrurroAhVBpYsKHbH-AE0Q6AEwDnoECAoQAQ#v=onepage&q=%22Pius%20VII%22%20%22Holy%20Roman%20Empire%22&f=false}}\n*{{Cite book|last=Datta|first=Pietro Luigi|url=https://books.google.com.ar/books?id=MYoIAAAAQAAJ&dq=vicario+imperiale+perpetuo+del+Sacro+Romano+Impero&hl=sv&source=gbs_navlinks_s|title=Lezioni di paleografia e di critica diplomatica sui documenti della monarchia de Savoia|publisher=Coi tipi di G.

Since the [[Middle Ages]], the Holy Roman Empire had been recognized by [[Western Europe]]ans as the legitimate continuation of the ancient [[Roman Empire]] due to its emperors having been proclaimed as [[Roman emperors]] by the [[Papacy]]. Through this Roman legacy, the Holy Roman Emperors claimed to be [[Universal monarchy|universal monarchs]] whose jurisdiction extended beyond their empire's formal borders to all of [[Christianity|Christian]] Europe and beyond. The formation of the first modern [[Sovereign state|sovereign territorial states]] in the 16th and 17th centuries, which brought with it the idea that jurisdiction corresponded to actual territory governed, threatened the universal nature of the Holy Roman Empire. \n\nThe Holy Roman Empire by the time of the 18th century was widely regarded by contemporaries, both inside and outside the empire, as a highly \"irregular\" monarchy and \"sick\", having a \"unusual\" form of government. The empire lacked both a central standing army and a central treasury and its monarchs, formally elective rather than hereditary, could not exercise effective central control. Even then, most contemporaries believed that the empire could be revived and restored to glory. The Holy Roman Empire did not experience its true terminal decline before its involvement in the [[French Revolutionary Wars]] and the [[Napoleonic Wars]]. \n\nAlthough the empire defended itself quite well initially, war with France and [[Napoleon]] proved catastrophic. In 1804, Napoleon proclaimed himself as the [[Emperor of the French]], which Francis II responded to by proclaiming himself the [[Emperor of Austria]], in addition to already being the Holy Roman Emperor, an attempt at maintaining parity between France and Austria while also illustrating that the Holy Roman title outranked them both. Austria's defeat at the [[Battle of Austerlitz]] in December 1805 and the secession of a large number of Francis II's German vassals in July 1806 to form the [[Confederation of the Rhine]], a French [[satellite state]], effectively meant the end of the Holy Roman Empire. The abdication in August 1806, combined with a dissolution of the entire imperial hierarchy and its institutions, was seen as necessary to prevent the possibility of Napoleon proclaiming himself as Holy Roman Emperor, something which would have reduced Francis II to Napoleon's vassal. \n\nReactions to the empire's dissolution ranged from indifference to despair. The populace of [[Vienna]], capital of the [[Habsburg Monarchy]], were horrified at the loss of the empire. Many of Francis II's former subjects questioned the legality of his actions; though his abdication was agreed to be perfectly legal, the dissolution of the empire and the release of all its vassals were seen as beyond the emperor's authority. As such, many of the empire's princes and subjects refused to accept that the empire was gone, with some commoners going so far as to believe that news of its dissolution was a plot by their local authorities. In Germany, the dissolution was widely compared to the ancient and semi-legendary [[Fall of Troy]] and some associated the end of the Roman Empire with the [[End time|end times]] and the [[apocalypse]].\n\n== Background ==\n{{See also|Holy Roman Empire#History|Problem of two emperors}}\n\n=== Ideology of the Holy Roman Empire ===\n[[File:Wien-khm-kunstkammer-francis1-0.jpg|left|thumb|Marble bust of the final [[Holy Roman Emperor]], [[Francis II, Holy Roman Emperor|Francis II]], in a style inspired by ancient Roman marble busts.]]\nThe defining characteristic of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] was the idea that the [[Holy Roman Emperor]] represented the leading monarch in Europe and that their empire was the one true continuation of the [[Roman Empire]] of [[Classical antiquity|Antiquity]], through proclamation by the [[Popes]] in [[Rome]]. It was the firm belief of its emperors that they were the sole genuine emperors in Europe and although they had formally recognized the rulers of [[Russian Empire|Russia]] as emperors in 1606 and the sultans of the [[Ottoman Empire]] as emperors in 1721, these recognitions were conditional on the fact that the Holy Roman Emperor was always pre-eminent.{{Sfn|Wilson|2009|p=25}} The pre-eminence of the emperor was an expression of the idea that the Holy Roman Empire, theoretically, extended over all [[Christians]] in a universal manner. Because the empire at no point ruled over all of Christian Europe, this idea was always an ideal rather than a reality. Imperial authority rested not on the emperor's own crown lands (though there were large crown lands in the 18th and 19th centuries) but on the emperor's role as the highest secular ruler in the world and a champion and advocate of the [[Catholic Church]]. The lack of a defined capital and consistent crown lands reinforced the idea that the imperial title was universal as it was not necessarily associated with any one area.{{Sfn|Wilson|2009|p=27}} \n\nThroughout its long existence, the Holy Roman Empire was a central element in international relations in Europe, not only because the empire itself was often one of the most powerful on the continent but also because of the emperor himself. Because the Holy Roman Emperors were the internationally recognized heirs of the old Roman emperors and the foremost Christian rulers, they claimed (and were often granted) precedence over other rulers.{{Sfn|Wilson|2006|p=709}}\n\nAlthough the emperors had been formally titled as \"Elected Roman Emperor\" since 1508, when Emperor [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor|Maximilian I]] took the title without the need for a Papal coronation, the universalist character of the empire was sustained through the emperor's [[Feudalism|feudal]] authority extending beyond just the institutions that had been developed within the formal imperial borders. Imperial territories held by rulers of other realms remained imperial vassals. For instance, the kings of both [[Sweden]] and [[Denmark]] accepted vassalage in regards to their German lands until 1806, when these lands were formally incorporated into their kingdoms.{{Sfn|Wilson|2009|p=27}} The [[Reformation]] of the 16th century had made managing the empire more difficult and made its role as \"holy\" questionable. Despite [[Lutheranism]] and [[Calvinism]] being tolerated from 1555 and 1648 onwards respectively, Catholicism remained the only recognized faith. Even then, the [[Imperial Church System|Imperial Church]] diminished from the 16th century onwards, only [[Electorate of Mainz|Mainz]] surviving as a ecclesiastical territory by 1803. The \"holy\" nature of the empire became even more questionable when the possibility of permanent peace with the Ottoman Empire, widely seen as the mortal enemies of Christian Europe, was accepted through the 1699 [[Treaty of Karlowitz|Peace of Karlowitz]].{{Sfn|Wilson|2009|p=28}}\n\nBoth the Papacy and the Holy Roman Empire continued to claim their traditional rights of universal jurisdiction into the early modern period, that it was their reight to exercise jurisdiction throughout the entire world, even if they did not have ''de facto'' control over particular territories.{{Sfn|Orford|2009|p=981}} Conjointly with the Papacy, the Holy Roman Empire represented the recognized centre of the Christian world, and one of the pillars upon which it rested. It was always its influence and its place in the recognized world order that gave the Holy Roman Empire its true power, rather than the actual extent of its territorial domains.{{Sfn|Bryce|1864|p=2}}\n\nOne of the greatest threats to the traditional (and theoretical) universal jurisdiction accorded to the Holy Roman Emperor and the Pope throughout the Christian world was the emergence of modern [[Sovereign state|sovereign territorial states]] in the 16th and 17th centuries, which meant the rise of the idea that jurisdiction was the same thing as direct control of territory.{{Sfn|Orford|2009|p=981}} To the rulers of territorial states, both the Papacy and the Holy Roman Empire represented \"universal antagonists\", claiming that jurisdiction over all the world was theirs by right through their connection to [[Ancient Rome]]. Ambitious emperors, such as [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]] ({{Reign}}1519\u20131556) and [[Ferdinand II, Holy Roman Emperor|Ferdinand II]] ({{Reign}}1619\u20131637), who sought to combine universal jurisdiction with actual universal temporal rule and universal imperial authority, represented threats to the continued existence of the countries of Europe.{{Sfn|Orford|2009|p=989}}\n\n=== The Holy Roman Empire in the 18th century ===\n[[File:Map of the Holy Roman Empire, 1789 en.png|thumb|The [[Holy Roman Empire]] and its internal subdivisions and vassals in 1789.]]\n\nBy the 18th century, the contemporary views of the Holy Roman Empire were far from universally positive. There was a widespread idea that the empire was \"sick\" in some capacity, for instance the bookseller and publisher [[Johann Heinrich Zedler]] mentions the \"state illnesses of the Holy Roman Empire\" in his 1745 ''[[Grosses Universal-Lexicon]]''. This view dates back to at least the [[Peace of Westphalia]] at the conclusion of the [[Thirty Years' War]] in 1648, where the empire was explicitly defined as not being a [[nation state]]. The 17th century historian [[Samuel von Pufendorf]] famously described the empire as having a \"unusual form of government\" and derided it as a \"monstrosity\", lacking what was required for an effective and functional state. The lack of a standing army, a central treasury, weak central control exercised by a monarch who was elective and not hereditary all contributed to the idea that there was no unified German state. In the view of its contemporaries, the empire had regressed from a \"regular\" monarchy into a highly irregular one.{{Sfn|Wilson|2009|p=23}}\n\nAlthough some German romantics and nationalists argued that the empire had to die for Germany to be reborn, a large number of imperial subjects had not given up hope that the \"sick\" empire might be cured and revived. The first few years of the 19th century saw extensive reorganizations and changes in power within the empire, with the 1801 [[Peace of Lun\u00e9ville]] with France meaning the end of imperial jurisdiction in the Netherlands and Italy, and the rise of powerful German rulers in the north, such as the Kings of [[Prussia]], causing the consolidation of many previously separate imperial vassals and fiefs into the hands of a few rulers. The traditional political hierarchy of the empire was disrupted, but it was not obvious to contemporaries that this was to lead to the empire's downfall, the general view was that it represented a new beginning rather than the last few steps towards an ending.{{Sfn|Wilson|2009|p=24}} Furthermore, many publicists within the empire did not see its nature as a \"irregular\" monarchy as something negative and were unconcerned with forming a new political or social order, but rather sought to augment the already present structures to create a better future. The Peace of Westphalia had explicitly designated that the empire was to remain non-aligned and passive and that it was to work to maintain peace in Europe, an arrangement approved of by most of its inhabitants.{{Sfn|Wilson|2009|p=28}}\n\nDespite the widespread idea that the Holy Roman Empire was \"sick\", the empire was not in terminal decline before its involvement in the [[French Revolutionary Wars]] from the 1790s onwards. In the 18th century, imperial institutions were experiencing something akin to a renaissance. The empire represented to safest and best guarantee for the rights of smaller states and territories in a time when Europe was beginning to be dominated by powerful imperial nation states. Because of the weak central government, the constituent territories of the empire could influence their own fates, the central [[Imperial Diet (Holy Roman Empire)|Reichstag]] decided policy and legislation and allowed the empire to coordinate its response to the threat represented by France and the two separate imperial supreme courts and the imperial circles represented successful venues for resolving inter-imperial conflicts.{{Sfn|Wilson|2009|p=25}} The Reichstag also worked as a place where weaker imperial princes could work to convince their more powerful counterparts to remain at peace and resolve their differences.{{Sfn|Wilson|2009|p=28}}\n\n== Wars with France and Napoleon ==\n\n=== Austrian war effort and responses ===\n[[File:Bataille de Fleurus 1794.JPG|left|thumb|''Battle of Fleurus'' by [[Jean-Baptiste Mauzaisse]] (1837). The [[Battle of Fleurus (1794)|Battle of Fleurus]] in 1794 saw the French defeat the [[Habsburg Monarchy]], the [[Dutch Republic]], [[Electorate of Hanover|Hanover]] and [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Great Britain]] and led to the permanent loss of the [[Austrian Netherlands]] and the Dutch Republic.]]\nAlthough the forces of the [[French First Republic]] overran and occupied the Netherlands in 1792, the Holy Roman Empire was defending itself quite well until Prussia abandoned the war effort to focus its attention on its Polish territories (overseeing the [[Second Partition of Poland|Second]] and [[Third Partition of Poland|Third Partitions of Poland]]), taking the resources and military strength of northern Germany with it.{{Sfn|Wilson|2009|p=25}} Despite the empire's mounting difficulties in the face of the wars with France, there was no large-scale popular unrest within its borders. Instead, the explanation for the end of the Holy Roman Empire lies in the realm of high politics. The empire's defeat in the Revolutionary Wars was the most decisive step in the gradual undermining of the empire.{{Sfn|Wilson|2006|p=712}} The conflict between France and the Holy Roman Empire had begun with the French declaring war on the newly crowned Emperor [[Francis II, Holy Roman Emperor|Francis II]] of the [[Habsburg Dynasty|Habsburg dynasty]] only in his capacity as the [[King of Hungary]], the fact that much of the wider empire (including influential figures such as the King of Prussia and the [[Archbishop-Elector of Mainz]]), however unwilling, joined the conflict on the side of the Habsburgs proves that imperial ideals were still alive by the late 18th century.{{Sfn|Wilson|2006|p=713}}\n\nThe key point in which fortunes shifted was Prussia's abandonment of the war effort. Prussia had been the only true counterweight to Austria's influence in the institutions of the empire. Though the western parts of Prussia, such as Brandenburg, remained formal parts of the Holy Roman Empire and the Prussians continued to be represented in the Reichstag, Prussia ceased to compete for influence in imperial affairs. Austria stood alone as the protector of the states in southern Germany, many of which began considering making their own separate peaces with France. When the Austrians learnt that [[Duchy of W\u00fcrttemberg|W\u00fcrttemberg]] and [[Margraviate of Baden|Baden]] had opened formal negotiations with France, the armies sent by these two states were disbanded and disarmed in 1796, causing resentment against the emperor and, combined with losses to France, suggesting that the Habsburg emperor was no longer capable of protecting his traditional vassals in Germany.{{Sfn|Wilson|2006|p=714}}\n\nIn the wake of the wars with France, there was a substantial reorganization of Imperial territory (the so-called ''[[Reichsdeputationshauptschluss]]'', supported by Prussia), with the [[Habsburg Monarchy]] meaning to compensate those princes who had lost territory in the French wars and effectivize the empire's current semi-feudal structure. Although there were huge territorial changes, notably the almost complete abolition of any church territory and significant territorial gains for [[Electorate of Bavaria|Bavaria]], Baden, W\u00fcrttemberg, [[Landgraviate of Hesse-Darmstadt|Hesse-Darmstadt]] and [[County of Nassau|Nassau]], the most important changes were in the empire's electoral college. [[Electorate of Salzburg|Salzburg]] was added as a fourth Catholic elector, while [[Electorate of W\u00fcrttemberg|W\u00fcrttemberg]], [[Electorate of Baden|Baden]] and [[Electorate of Hesse|Hesse-Kassel]] became the fourth, fifth and sixth Protestant electors, given the Protestants a majority for the first time in history and raising doubts whether Emperor Francis II would be able to work together with his Reichstag. Although the Austrian regime spent much time and resources attempting to make the new arrangement work, the general verdict at the time was that the reorganization had essentially killed the empire.{{Sfn|Wilson|2006|p=|pp=719\u2013720}}\n\n=== Reaction to Napoleon's imperial coronation ===\n[[File:Jacques-Louis David - The Coronation of Napoleon (1805-1807).jpg|thumb|''[[The Coronation of Napoleon]]'' by [[Jacques-Louis David]] (1807). [[Napoleon|Napoleon Bonaparte]] incorporated many traditional imperial symbols and traditions into his 1804 [[Coronation of Napoleon I|coronation]] as [[Emperor of the French]], some deriving from the [[Holy Roman Empire]] and some deriving from [[Ancient Rome]].]]\n\nThe head of the French republic, [[Napoleon]], assumed the title \"[[Empire of the French]]\" in 1804. This act received a mixed reaction in the Holy Roman Empire. Although a return to monarchy in France was welcomed (though unfortunate in so far that the monarch was Napoleon), the imperial title (instead of a royal one) was not.{{Sfn|Wilson|2006|p=723}} In the empire, Napoleon's title raised fears that it might inspire the Russian Emperor to insist that he was equal to the Holy Roman Emperor and might encourage other monarchs, such as [[George III of the United Kingdom|George III]] of the [[United Kingdom]], to also proclaim themselves emperors.{{Sfn|Wilson|2009|p=26}} The Habsburg diplomat [[Ludwig von Cobenzl]], fearing the consequences of Napoleon's coronation, is quoted as having advised Holy Roman Emperor Francis II that \"\u2018as Roman Emperor, Your Majesty has enjoyed till now precedence ahead of all European potentates, including the Russian emperor\".{{Sfn|Wilson|2009|p=25}}\n\nThough Napoleon's imperial title was viewed with distaste, Austrian officials immediately realized that if they were to refuse to accept him as an emperor, war with France would be renewed. Instead, the focus became on how to accept Napoleon as an emperor while still maintaining the pre-eminence of their own emperor and empire.{{Sfn|Wilson|2006|p=723}} France had officially accepted parity with [[Archduchy of Austria|Austria]] as a distinct state in 1757, 1797 and 1801 and in the same settlements accepted that the Holy Roman Empire outranked both Austria and France. Thus, it was decided that Austria would be raised to the rank of an empire in order to maintain the parity between Austria and France while still preserving the Roman imperial title as pre-eminent, outranking both.{{Sfn|Wilson|2009|p=26}}\n\n=== Empire of Austria ===\n[[File:Imperial Crown of Austria (Vienna).JPG|thumb|The [[Imperial Crown of Austria]] (pictured) was the personal crown originally made for Emperor [[Rudolf II, Holy Roman Emperor|Rudolf II]] ({{Reign}}1576\u20131612) of the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. The traditional crown of the Holy Roman Emperors, the ''[[Reichskrone]]'', ceased being used in 1806, but Rudolf's crown was used until the end of the [[Habsburg Monarchy]] in the 20th century.]]\nFrancis II proclaimed himself as [[Emperor of Austria]] (without the need of a new coronation, as he had already had an imperial coronation) on 11 August 1804, in addition to already being the Holy Roman Emperor.{{Sfn|Wilson|2009|p=26}} Cobenzl advised that a separate hereditary Austrian title would also allow the Habsburg to maintain parity with other rulers (since the Holy Roman title was viewed by Cobenzl as merely honorific) and ensure elections to the position of Holy Roman Emperor in the future.{{Sfn|Wilson|2006|p=723}} A myriad of reasons were used to justify the Austrian Empire's creation, including the number of subjects under the Habsburg Monarchy, the vast extent of his crown lands and the long association between the Habsburg family and the elective Holy Roman imperial title. Another important point used to justify its creation was that Francis was, in the traditional sense, the supreme Christian monarch and he was thus entitled to award himself with any dignities he wished.{{Sfn|Wilson|2009|p=31}} The title \"Emperor of Austria\" was meant to associate with all of Francis II's personal domains (not just Austria, but also lands such as [[Bohemia]] and [[Hungary]]), regardless of their current position within or outside the Holy Roman Empire. \"Austria\" in this sense referred to the dynasty (often officially called the \"House of Austria\" instead of the \"House of Habsburg\"), not the geographical location.{{Sfn|Wilson|2009|p=32}} \n\nThe title of Holy Roman Emperor remained pre-eminent to both \"Emperor of the French\" and \"Emperor of Austria\" as it embodied the traditional ideal of the universal Christian empire. Neither the Austrian nor the French title made claims to govern this universal empire and thus did not disturb the traditional and established world order.{{Sfn|Wilson|2006|p=723}} The imperial titles of Austria and France were seen as more or less royal titles (as they were hereditary) and in the minds of the Austrians, there still remained only one true empire and one true emperor in Europe. To illustrate this, Francis II's official imperial title read \"elected Roman Emperor, ever Augustus, hereditary Emperor of Austria\", placing the Austrian title behind the Roman title.{{Sfn|Wilson|2009|p=26}}\n\nFrancis II stated that he would only recognize Napoleon as the Emperor of the French if Napoleon in turn recognized him as the Emperor of Austria and though Napoleon was reluctant to tie his own imperial title to any concessions, he needed recognition from the Habsburgs to secure wider recognition throughout Europe and thus agreed to recognize Francis II's new title. George III of the United Kingdom recognized the new title in October and although Russian Emperor [[Alexander I of Russia|Alexander I]] objected to Francis \"lowering himself to the level of the usurper Napoleon\", he recognized the title in November. The only significant objections to Francis II's title were raised by Sweden, who through holding [[Swedish Pomerania]], an [[Imperial Estate]], had a place in the Reichstag. The Swedes saw the title as a \"clear breach\" of the imperial constitution and demanded a formal debate in the Reichstag, a threat that was neutralized by the other parties of the Reichstag agreeing to an extended summer recesses until November.{{Sfn|Wilson|2006|p=725}} To defend the title, imperial representatives argued that it did not infringe on the imperial constitution as there were already other examples of dual monarchies within the empire, states such as Prussia and Sweden were not part of the empire, but their possessions within the empire were.{{Sfn|Wilson|2006|p=726}}\n\n=== Peace of Pressburg ===\n[[File:Austerlitz-baron-Pascal.jpg|thumb|''Napol\u00e9on at the Battle of Austerlitz'' by [[Fran\u00e7ois G\u00e9rard]] (1810). The [[Battle of Austerlitz]] in 1805 saw the [[First French Empire|French Empire]] defeat both the [[Holy Roman Empire]] and the [[Russian Empire]] and allowed French dominion to extend into Germany.|alt=]]\nThe [[War of the Third Coalition]] came too soon for Austria, which moved against France in September 1805. Defeated at the [[Battle of Austerlitz]] on 2 December 1805, Austria had to accept terms dictated by Napoleon in the [[Peace of Pressburg (1805)|Peace of Pressburg]] (26 December). These created deliberate ambiguities in the imperial constitution. [[Electorate of Bavaria|Bavaria]], [[Electorate of Baden|Baden]] and [[Electorate of W\u00fcrttemberg|W\u00fcrttemberg]] were granted ''pl\u00e9nitude de la souverainet\u00e9'' (full sovereignty) while remaining a part of the ''Conf\u00e9deration Germanique'' (Germanic Confederation), a novel name for the Holy Roman Empire.{{sfn|Whaley|2012|pp=634\u2013635}}Likewise, it was left deliberately unclear whether the [[Duchy of Cleves]], the [[Grand Duchy of Berg|Duchy of Berg]] and the [[County of Mark]]\u2014imperial territories transferred to [[Joachim Murat]]\u2014were to remain imperial fiefs or become part of the French Empire. As late as March 1806, Napoleon was uncertain whether they should remain nominally within the Empire.{{sfn|Whaley|2012|p=636}}\n\nThe [[Free Imperial Knights]], who had survived the attack on their rights in ''[[Rittersturm]]'' of 1803\u201304, were subject to a second attack and a spate of annexations by those states allied to Napoleon in November\u2013December 1805. In response, the knights' corporation (''corpus equestre'') dissolved itself on 20 January 1806. With the dissolution of the Empire, the knights ceased to be either free or imperial and were at the mercy of the newly sovereign states.{{sfn|Whaley|2012|p=636}}{{sfn|Godsey|2004|p=145}}\n\nContemporaries saw the defeat at Austerlitz as a turning point of world-historical significance. The Peace of Pressburg, too, was perceived as radical shift. It did not affirm previous treaties in the usual way and its wording seemed to raise Bavaria, Baden and W\u00fcrttemberg into equals of the empire while downgrading the latter to a merely German confederation.{{sfn|Whaley|2012|pp=634\u2013635}} Nevertheless, Bavaria and W\u00fcrttemberg reaffirmed to the Reichstag that they were subject to imperial law. Some commentators argued that ''pl\u00e9nitude de la souverainet\u00e9'' was just a French translation of ''[[Landeshoheit]]'' (the quasi-sovereignty possessed by imperial estates) and the treaty had not altered the relationship between the members and the empire.{{sfn|Whaley|2012|p=637}}\n\n== Formation of the Confederation of the Rhine ==\nThroughout the first half of 1806, Bavaria, Baden and W\u00fcrttemberg attempted to steer an independent course between the demands of the empire and Napoleon. In April 1806, Napoleon sought a treaty whereby the three states would ally themselves to France in perpetuity while forswearing participation in future ''[[Reichskrieg]]e'' (imperial war efforts) and submitting to a ''commission de m\u00e9ditation'' under his presidency to resolve their disputes. Despite all of this, they were to remain members of the empire. W\u00fcrttemberg ultimately refused to sign.{{sfn|Whaley|2012|p=637}}\n\nIn June 1806, Napoleon began pressuring Bavaria, Baden and W\u00fcrttemberg for the creation of ''conf\u00e9d\u00e9ration de la haute Allemagne'' (Upper German confederation) outside the empire.{{sfn|Whaley|2012|p=637}} On 12 July 1806, these three states and thirteen other minor German princes formed the [[Confederation of the Rhine]], effectively a French [[satellite state]].{{Sfn|Wilson|2009|p=33}} On 1 August, the Reichstag was informed by a French envoy that Napoleon no longer recognized the existence of the Holy Roman Empire and on the same day, nine of the princes who had formed the Confederation of the Rhine issued a proclamation in which they justified their actions by claiming that the Holy Roman Empire had already collapsed and ceased to function due to the defeat in the Battle of Austerlitz.{{Sfn|Wilson|2009|p=33}}\n\n== Abdication of Francis II ==\n[[File:P\u00f6rtr\u00e4t_Kaiser_Franz_I_von_\u00d6sterreich.jpg|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:P%C3%B6rtr%C3%A4t_Kaiser_Franz_I_von_%C3%96sterreich.jpg|alt=|thumb|[[Francis II, Holy Roman Emperor|Francis I]] as [[Austrian Emperor]], ''undated'', [[Salzburg Museum]]]]\nIn the face of Napoleon's assumption of the title \"Emperor of the French\" in 1804 and the Austrian defeat at the Battle of Austerlitz in 1805, the Habsburg Monarchy began contemplating whether the imperial title and the empire as a whole were worth defending. Many of the states nominally serving the Holy Roman Emperor, such as Baden, W\u00fcrttemberg and Bavaria, had openly defied imperial authority and sided with Napoleon. Even then, the significance of the empire was not based on actual control of resources, but on prestige.{{Sfn|Wilson|2009|p=25}}\n\nThe main idea behind Francis II's actions in 1806 was to lay the groundwork needed to avoid additional future wars with Napoleon and France.{{Sfn|Wilson|2009|p=30}} One concern held by the Habsburg Monarchy was that Napoleon might aspire to claim the title of Holy Roman Emperor.{{Sfn|Wilson|2009|p=33}} Napoleon was attracted to [[Charlemagne]]'s legacy; replicas of Charlemagne's crown and sword had been made for (but not used during) Napoleon's coronation as Emperor of the French and he conciously revived Roman imperial symbols and aspired to create a new order in Europe, something akin to the universal dominion implicit in the title of Emperor of the Romans. Napoleon's vision of Charlemagne was completely different from the German vision of the old emperor, however. Instead of seeing Charlemagne as a German king, Napoleon viewed him as a [[Franks|Frankish]] conqueror who had extended French rule across Central Europe and Italy, something Napoleon aspired to accomplish as well.{{Sfn|Wilson|2009|p=34}} Despite his fixation on Charlemagne, there is no evidence that Napoleon aspired to become Holy Roman Emperor.{{Sfn|Wilson|2006|p=727}}\n\nAustria was slow to respond to the fast pace of events. Already on the 17 June, Francis had taken the decision to abdicate at the moment that seemed best for Austria. [[Klemens von Metternich]] was sent on a mission to Paris to discern Napoleon's intentions. On 22 July, Napoleon made them clear. He issued an ultimatum demanding that Francis abdicated by 10 August.{{sfn|Whaley|2012|pp=643\u2013644}} Still, as late as 2 August, Joseph Haas, the head of the principal commission's secretariat, hoped that the end of the Holy Roman Empire might yet be averted.{{Sfn|Wilson|2006|p=730}} The general opinion among the Austrian high command was however that abdication was inevitable and that it should be combined with a dissolution of the Holy Roman Empire through relieving the vassals of the emperor of their duties and obligations. A formal dissolution of the empire was perceived as necessary, as it would prevent Napoleon from acquiring the imperial title. During an interregnum, the two [[Imperial vicar|imperial vicars]] [[Electorate of Saxony|Saxony]] and Bavaria would be entitled to exercise imperial authority and since both were aligned with Napoleon, such an arrangement could cause an abdicated Francis (as only Emperor of Austria) to become a vassal of Napoleon (as Holy Roman Emperor). More crucially, the abdication was also intended to buy time for Austria to recover from its losses as it was assumed that France would meet it with some concessions.{{Sfn|Wilson|2006|p=731}} Although the Roman title and the tradition of a universal Christian monarchy were still considered prestigious and a worthy heritage, they were now also considered things of the past. With the Holy Roman Empire dissolved, Francis II could focus his attention on the continued rise and prosperity of his new hereditary empire, as Emperor Francis I of Austria.{{Sfn|Wilson|2009|p=31}}\n\nOn the morning of 6 August 1806, the imperial herald of the Holy Roman Empire rode from the [[Hofburg]] to the Jesuit Church of the Nine Choirs of Angels (both being located in [[Vienna]], the capital of the Habsburg Monarchy), where he delivered Francis II's official proclamation from a balcony overlooking a large square. Written copies of the proclamation were dispatched to the diplomats of the Habsburg monarchy on 11 August alongside a note which informed former princes of the empire that Austria would compensate those who had been paid from the imperial treasury.{{Sfn|Wilson|2006|p=731}} The abdication did not acknowledge the French ultimatum, but stressed the interpretation of the Peace of Pressburg by the imperial estates made it impossible for Francis to fulfill the obligations he had undertaken in his [[electoral capitulation]].{{sfn|Whaley|2012|pp=643\u2013644}}\n\nHoly Roman Emperors had abdicated before\u2014the most notable example being the abdication of Charles V in 1558\u2014but Francis II's abdication was unique. While previous abdications had returned the imperial crown to the electors so that they may proclaim a new emperor, Francis II's abdication simultaneously dissolved the empire itself so that there were no more electors.{{Sfn|Wilson|2006|p=732}}\n\n== Aftermath ==\n\n=== Reactions ===\n[[File:Sarcophagus Emperor Franz II.(I.) Vienna Austria.jpg|thumb|[[Sarcophagus]] of Emperor [[Francis II, Holy Roman Emperor|Francis II]] in the [[Imperial Crypt]] in [[Vienna]]. The associated plaque describes him as the \"last Roman emperor\".|alt=|left]]The passing of the Holy Roman Empire, an institution which had lasted for just over a thousand years, did not pass unnoticed or unlamented. The dissolution of the empire sent shockwaves through Germany, with most of the reactions within the former imperial boundaries were reactions of rage, grief or shame. Even the signatories of the Confederation of the Rhine were outraged; the Bavarian emissary to the imperial diet, Rechberg, stated that he was \"furious\" due to having \"put his signature to the destruction of the German name\", referring to his state's involvement in the confederation, which had effectively doomed the empire.{{Sfn|Burgdorf|2012|p=52}} From a legal standpoint, Francis II's abdication was controversial. Contemporary legal commentators agreed that the abdication itself was perfectly legal but that the emperor did not have the authority to dissolve the empire.{{Sfn|Wilson|2006|p=733}} As such, several of the empire's vassals refused to recognize that the empire had ended.{{sfn|Gagliardo|1980|p=281}} As late as October 1806, farmers in [[Thuringia]] refused to accept the end of the empire, believing its dissolution to be a plot by the local authorities.{{Sfn|Burgdorf|2012|p=52}} For many of the people within the former empire, its collapse made them uncertain and fearful of their future, and the future of Germany itself.{{Sfn|Burgdorf|2012|p=55}} Contemporary reports from Vienna describe the dissolution of the empire as \"incomprehensible\" and the general public's reaction as one of horror.{{Sfn|Burgdorf|2012|p=58}}\n\nIn contrast to the fears of the general public, many contemporary intellectuals and artists saw Napoleon as a herald of a new age, rather than a destroyer of an old order.{{Sfn|Wilson|2006|p=734}} The popular idea forwarded by German nationalists was that the final collapse of the Holy Roman Empire freed Germany from the somewhat anachronistic ideas rooted in a fading ideal of universal Christianity and paved the way for the country's unification as the [[German Empire]], a nation state, 65 years later.{{Sfn|Wilson|2009|p=23}} German historian Helmut R\u00f6ssler has argued that Francis II and the Austrians fought to save the largely ungrateful Germany from the forces of Napoleon, only withdrawing and abandoning the empire when most of Germany betrayed them and joined Napoleon.{{Sfn|Wilson|2006|p=711}} Indeed, the assumption of a separate Austrian imperial title in 1804 did not mean that Francis II had any intentions to abdicate his prestigious position as the Roman emperor, the idea only began to be considered as circumstances beyond Habsburg control forced decisive actions to be taken.{{Sfn|Wilson|2006|p=726}}\n\nCompounded with fears of what now guaranteed the safety of many of the smaller German states, the poet [[Christoph Martin Wieland]] lamented that Germany had now fallen into an \"apocalyptic time\" and stating \"Who can bear this disgrace, which weighs down upon a nation which was once so glorious?\u2014may God improve things, if it is still possible to improve them!\".{{Sfn|Burgdorf|2012|p=59}} To some, the dissolution of the Holy Roman Empire was seen as the final end of the ancient Roman Empire. In the words of Christian Gottlob von Voigt, a minister in [[Weimar]], \"if poetry can go hand in hand with politics, then the abdication of the imperial dignity offers a wealth of material. The Roman Empire now takes its place in the sequence of vanquished empires\".{{Sfn|Burgdorf|2012|p=56}} In the words of the English historian [[James Bryce, 1st Viscount Bryce]] in his 1864 work on the Holy Roman Empire, the empire was the \"oldest political institution in the world\" and the same institution as the one founded by [[Augustus]] in 27 BC. Writing of the empire, Bryce stated that \"nothing else so directly linked the old world to the new\u2014nothing else displayed so many strange contrasts of the present and the past, and summed up in those contrasts so much of European history\".{{Sfn|Bryce|1864|p=2}} When confronted by the fall and collapse of their empire, many contemporaries employed the catastrophic [[Trojan War|fall of ancient Troy]] as a metaphor, due to its association with the notion of total destruction and the end of a culture.{{Sfn|Burgdorf|2012|p=|pp=60\u201361}} The image of the [[Apocalyptic literature|apocalypse]] was also frequently used, associating the collapse of the Holy Roman Empire with an impending end of the world (echoing medieval legends of a [[Last Roman Emperor]], a figure prophesized to be active during the [[End time|end times]]).{{Sfn|Burgdorf|2012|p=63}}\n[[File:Johann Philipp Palm-Denkmal von Konrad Knoll in Braunau am Inn.jpg|thumb|1866 statue of [[Johann Philipp Palm]] by [[Konrad Knoll]] in [[Braunau am Inn]].

Among the aspects most criticized by the general populace was the removal or replacement of the traditional intercessions for the empire and emperor in the daily church prayers throughout former imperial territory. Suppression from France, combined with individual examples of sensational retribution against pro-empire advocates ensured that these protests soon died down.{{Sfn|Burgdorf|2012|p=64}} In particular, few dared to voice their lament and criticism directly after the French executed the Nuremberg book dealer [[Johann Philipp Palm]] on 26 August after he had advocated for saving the empire.{{Sfn|Wilson|2006|p=735}}\n\nIn an official capacity, Prussia's response was only formulaic expressions of regret owing to the \"termination of an honourable bond hallowed by time\".{{Sfn|Wilson|2006|p=734}} Prussia's representative to the Reichstag, Baron G\u00f6rtz, reacted with sadness, mixed with gratitude and affection for the House of Habsburg and their former role as emperors.{{Sfn|Wilson|2006|p=735}} G\u00f6rtz had taken part as an electoral emissary of the [[Electorate of Brandenburg]] (Prussia's territory within the formal imperial borders) in 1792, at the election of Francis II as Holy Roman Emperor, and exclaimed that \"So the emperor whom I helped elect was the last emperor!\u2014This step was no doubt to be expected, but that does not make its reality any less moving and crushing. It cuts off the last thread of hope to which one tried to cling\".{{Sfn|Burgdorf|2012|p=54}} Baron von Wiessenberg, the Austrian envoy to the Electorate of Hesse-Kassel, reported that the local elector, [[William I, Elector of Hesse|William I]], had teared up and expressed lament at the loss of \"a constitution to which Germany had for so long owed its happiness and freedom\".{{Sfn|Wilson|2006|p=735}}\n\nInternationally, the empire's demise was met with mixed or indifferent reactions. Alexander I of Russia offered no response and [[Christian VII of Denmark|Christian VII]] of Denmark formally incorporated his German lands into his kingdoms a few months after the empire's dissolution. [[Gustav IV Adolf of Sweden|Gustav IV]] of Sweden (who notably hadn't recognized the separate imperial title of Austria yet) issued a somewhat provocative proclamation to the denizens of his German lands (Swedish Pomerania and [[Bremen-Verden]]) on 22 August 1806, stating that the dissolution of the Holy Roman Empire \"would not destroy the German nation\" and expressed hopes that the empire might be revived.{{Sfn|Wilson|2009|p=27}}{{Sfn|Wilson|2006|p=734}}\n\nThe dissolution of the Holy Roman Empire was constituted by Francis II's own personal abdication of the title and the release of all vassals and imperial states from their obligations and duties to the emperor.{{Sfn|Wilson|2006|p=731}} The title of Holy Roman Emperor (theoretically the same title as Roman emperor) and the Holy Roman Empire itself as an idea and institution (the theoretically universally sovereign ''imperium'') were never technically abolished. The continued existence of an universal empire, though without defined territory and lacking an emperor, was sometimes referenced in the titles of other later monarchs. For instance, the [[House of Savoy|Savoyard]] [[Kings of Italy]] continued to claim the title \"Prince and Perpetual Vicar of the Holy Roman Empire (in Italy)\" (a title originating from an 14th-century imperial grant from Emperor [[Charles IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles IV]] to their ancestor [[Amadeus VI, Count of Savoy|Amedeus VI]], [[Count of Savoy]]){{Sfn|Datta|1834|p=174}} until the abolition of the Italian monarchy in 1946.{{Sfn|Davies|2012|p=}}\n\n=== Successor empires ===\n[[File:Dual Alliance in 1914.svg|left|thumb|The [[German Empire]] (blue) and [[Austria-Hungary]] (red) in 1914.

The German Empire, proclaimed in 1871, formed an ideological successor of the Holy Roman Empire, but its rulers were ill-at-ease with their imperial role and its implications.]]\nIn the [[Austrian Empire]], the Habsburg dynasty continued to act as a substitute for nationality, the Austrian imperial title was not (unlike for instance the French or Russian imperial titles) associated with any nationality in particular.{{Sfn|Wilson|2009|p=32}} Though the German vassals of the Holy Roman Empire had been released from their obligations, Francis II and his successors continued to rule a large German-speaking population and the Holy Roman imperial regalia continued to be kept within their domains (and are to this day stored and displayed at the [[Imperial Treasury, Vienna|Imperial Treasury]] at the Hofburg in Vienna). The dynasty retained its prominent status among the royal families of Europe and were in the eyes of many of their subjects still the only true imperial family.{{Sfn|Wilson|2009|p=33}} Although the new Austrian Empire lacked many of the key elements of the Holy Roman Empire, it remained close in practice and ideals to the pre-1806 empire.{{Sfn|Wilson|2009|p=36}}\n\nIn the aftermath of Francis II's abdication, the new Austrian Empire took steps to distance itself from the older empire. The symbols and formal titles of the Austrian monarchy were altered to stress Austria as a distinct entity. Because the term ''Kaiserthum Osterreich'' (Austrian Empire) had entered everyday speech, the monarchy soon dropped the original prefix \"hereditary\", which had been used from 1804 to 1806 to stress the difference between Austria and the Holy Roman Empire.{{Sfn|Wilson|2006|p=734}}\n\nIn addition to the Austrian Empire (and France under Napoleon), the most prominent potential claimant to the Holy Roman Empire's legacy (in the sense of ruling Germany) in the wake of its collapse and dissolution was the Kingdom of Prussia, ruled by the [[House of Hohenzollern]]. Alongside, the growing crown lands of the Habsburgs, Prussia represented the sole major power in Central Europe during the last century or so of Holy Roman imperial rule. It was frequently rumored that the Prussians had imperial ambitions and [[Frederick the Great|Frederick II]] of Prussia was a rumored candidate to the position of Holy Roman Emperor in 1740. Frederick II, and other Prussian kings, dismissed these ideas while they remained under imperial rule, arguing that additional territory and power would be more beneficial than the imperial title. In 1795 and again in 1803 and 1804, French representatives suggested that Prussia might convert its northern German territories into an empire, but the Hohenzollerns were not interested in going through with such a plan. Though the Prussian rulers and their officials expressed sorrow at the collapsing state of the Holy Roman Empire from 1792 onwards, they were also critical to nostalgia for Germany's history under imperial rule. The Prussians viewed the survival chances of the Holy Roman Empire as very low and saw the French as the true successors of the ancient Carolingians, an enemy which they believed could not be defeated by the normal military means.{{Sfn|Wilson|2009|p=35}} \n\nThe reluctance of the Hohenzollerns to assume an imperial title shifted in 1806 as they feared that with the formation of the Confederation of the Rhine and the dissolution of the Holy Roman Empire, Napoleon might aspire to claim the hypothetical position of \"Emperor of Germany\". Though preparations were made to create a \"imperial union\" in northern Germany, with an emperor of the Hohenzollern dynasty, these plans were dropped in September of 1806 after they found little support and Emperor Alexander I of Russia objected to the plans. Because the Hohenzollerns lacked imperial ancestry they did not see themselves as an imperial dynasty and even after Napoleon's ultimate defeats in 1813 and 1815, their position changed little. Although Germany was united into the [[German Empire]] in 1871, under the Hohenzollern emperor [[William I, German Emperor|Wilhelm I]], the proclamation of the new empire was ideologically problematic and the Hohenzollerns found themselves mostly ill-at-ease with its implications. Attempts were made to associate the German Empire with the institutions of the Holy Roman Empire, but its emperors continued to enumerate themselves after the Kings of Prussia; Emperor [[Frederick III, German Emperor|Frederick III]] ({{Reign}}1888) was enumerated after his predecessor as king, Frederick II, not after the previous imperial Frederick (Emperor [[Frederick III, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick III]] of the 15th century, the new Frederick would then have been Frederick IV).{{Sfn|Wilson|2009|p=36}}\n\nDespite the Holy Roman Empire ultimately failing in preventing war with France, the late empire's nominal role as working for peace and forming a loose sort of hegemony and partnership offered an alternative to both the universal monarchy of Napoleon's French Empire and the universal republic advocated for by Revolutionary France and it served as a model for future constitutions for international bodies and organizations.{{Sfn|Wilson|2009|p=28}}\n\n== References ==\n\n=== Citations ===\n{{Reflist|20em}}\n\n=== Bibliography ===\n{{refbegin}}\n*{{Cite book|last=Burgdorf|first=Wolfgang|url=https://books.google.se/books?id=UQkyAQAAQBAJ&pg=PA51&lpg=PA51&dq=%22%E2%80%98Once+we+were+Trojans!%E2%80%99+Contemporary+Reactions+to+the+Dissolution+of+the+Holy+Roman+Empire+of+the+German+Nation%22&source=bl&ots=nuEK5h--yj&sig=ACfU3U0PG-Y4WU8R5JSbI5bNhBZZWEm4Iw&hl=sv&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwi81s_pn7roAhX0AxAIHY9JCAEQ6AEwAnoECAkQAQ#v=onepage&q=%22%E2%80%98Once%20we%20were%20Trojans!%E2%80%99%20Contemporary%20Reactions%20to%20the%20Dissolution%20of%20the%20Holy%20Roman%20Empire%20of%20the%20German%20Nation%22&f=false|title=The Holy Roman Empire, 1495-1806: A European Perspective|publisher=Brill |year=2012|isbn=978-90-04-20683-0|editor1-last=Evans|editor1-first=Robert|location=|pages=|chapter=\u2018Once we were Trojans!\u2019 Contemporary Reactions to the Dissolution of the Holy Roman Empire of the German Nation|ref=CITEREFBurgdorf2012|editor2-last=Wilson|editor2-first=Peter H.}}\n*{{cite book|last=Bryce|first=Viscount James Bryce|title=The Holy Roman Empire|publisher=Good Press|year=2019|location=|pages=|asin=B081TFMGRC|ref=CITEREFBryce1864|orig-year=1864|url=https://books.google.se/books?id=VyfDDwAAQBAJ&pg=PT15&lpg=PT15&dq=%22Pius+VII%22+%22Holy+Roman+Empire%22&source=bl&ots=4k5-pkfIcp&sig=ACfU3U2RJtsDBSlr-H9y0ORlgZ8De7JQwg&hl=sv&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiRi_OrurroAhVBpYsKHbH-AE0Q6AEwDnoECAoQAQ#v=onepage&q=%22Pius%20VII%22%20%22Holy%20Roman%20Empire%22&f=false}}\n*{{Cite book|last=Datta|first=Pietro Luigi|url=https://books.google.com.ar/books?id=MYoIAAAAQAAJ&dq=vicario+imperiale+perpetuo+del+Sacro+Romano+Impero&hl=sv&source=gbs_navlinks_s|title=Lezioni di paleografia e di critica diplomatica sui documenti della monarchia de Savoia|publisher=Coi tipi di G.

A former village within the County of [[Midlothian]], it lies to the south west of the city, between [[Juniper Green]] (NE) and [[Balerno]] (SW) on the [[A70 road|Lanark Road]]. Administratively, Currie falls within the jurisdiction of the [[Politics of Edinburgh|City of Edinburgh Council]]. It gives its name to a [[Civil parishes in Scotland|civil parish]].\n\nIn 2001 the population of Currie was 8,550 and it contained 3,454 houses.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.currie-scc.gov.uk/ccc11.html | title = Currie Community Council | accessdate = 2012-06-24}}</ref>\n \n== Etymology ==\nThere is no accepted derivation of the name Currie but it is possibly from the [[Scottish Gaelic]] word ''curagh/curragh'', a wet or boggy plain, or from the [[British language (Celtic)|Brythonic]] word ''curi'', a dell or dirt hole.  The neighbouring suburb of [[Balerno]] derives its name from [[Scottish Gaelic]], whilst the nearby [[Pentland Hills]] derive their name from Brythonic, so either is possible.\n\n== History ==\n\nThe earliest record of a settlement in the Currie area is a [[Bronze Age]] razor (1800 BC) found at Kinleith Mill and the stone cists (500 BC) at Duncan's Belt and Blinkbonny. There are a few mentions of this area in [[mediaeval]] and early modern documents. One of the first is when Robert of Kildeleith became Chancellor of Scotland in 1249. Kildeleith means Chapel by the Leith, and survives today as Kinleith. [[Robert the Bruce]] gave [[Riccarton, Edinburgh|Riccarton]] as a wedding present in 1315 and in 1392 the land passed to the family of Bishop Wardlaw. In 1612 the land went to Ludovic Craig, a Senator of the [[College of Justice]]. In 1818 it passed to the female line and became the property of the Gibson-Craigs.\n\nThere has been a Christian community in the area for more than 1,000 years. In 1018, the archdeacons of [[Lothian]] set up their headquarters in the area. [[John Bartholomew]]'s Civic and Ecclesiastical maps of the 13th century do not show Currie, but the Index of Charters 1309-1413 records Currie as being 'favourite hunting grounds' for the Lords and Knights of [[Edinburgh Castle]]. A settlement began to take shape around Currie Kirk and the main Lanark Road, which was the main route south and continues to be known as 'The [[Lang Whang]]'.\n\nThe weaver poet [[James Thomson (weaver poet)|James Thomson]] was brought up in the village in the late 18th century and is commemorated by the dell of the Kinleith Burn being named the \"Poet's Glen\", where it runs down from beside his cottage at Mid Kinleith Farm to join the Water of Leith, and also by a number of street names, (Thomson Road, Thomson Drive, Thomson Crescent), in the east of Currie.\n\nThe war memorial was erected in 1919 to a design by Sir [[Robert Lorimer]].<ref>Dictionary of Scottish Architects: Robert Lorimer</ref>\n\nThe period 1921-1951 brought great changes with the building of more council houses in Currie and private building along Lanark Road. Wider scale development began in the late 1950s and early 1960s with the construction of a private housing estate to the east of Curriehill Road. House builders began to promote Currie as a pleasant commuting suburb of Edinburgh and much house building took place to the north of Lanark Road West. Currie High School was constructed on its present site in 1966 and extensively refurbished and renewed in 1997. There was a [[Currie railway station|Currie station]] on [[Balerno line|a short loop railway]] running over what is now the [[Water of Leith Walkway]]. The physical topography has ensured that the original historic core to the south of Lanark Road West including the Water of Leith has remained undeveloped. In March 1972 the historic centre of Currie was declared a [[Conservation Area]].\n\n== Education ==\nThe earliest record of education in the area is contained in the Minutes of Edinburgh Town Council in 1598, when Baillie Lawrence Henderson was sent to \"the toun o Currie to help the gentlemen of the Parish select a Schoolmaister\"; however it is not stated where the school was situated. In 1694, the heritors appointed a Mr Thomson to teach scholars in the Church until Thomas Craig of Riccarton found a place for the building of a school and house for the schoolmaster. The foundations of the school were laid in 1699. The school and school house cost 500 merks and the salary of the schoolmaster was 20 pounds Scots per year.\n\nCurrie is served by [[Currie High School]] (which has been a Green Flag Eco-School since 2004), Nether Currie Primary School and Currie Primary School, formed by an amalgamation in 2005 of Curriehill Primary School and Riccarton Primary School which shared neighbouring campuses. The largest single Year group since the School's inception, was 1984. According to the School Website this number will probably never be equalled or exceeded. CHS has sought to improve facilities since 2000 with additions of All Weather, floodlit Football Pitches. \n\nFrom the 1970s onwards, [[Heriot-Watt University]] moved from its city centre location to occupy the lands of the former Riccarton Estate, gifted to the university by Midlothian County Council in 1966. The move has now been completed and the main campus of Heriot-Watt University occupies and manages a wooded area with enough space for future expansion.\n\n== Sport ==\n\n=== Football ===\nCurrie has two youth football teams Currie Football Club and Currie Star FC (Currie Star play their games in the [[Kingsknowe]] area of [[Edinburgh]]).\n\n=== Rugby ===\nCurrie has one rugby team, Currie RFC who are based and play their home games in the neighbouring village of [[Balerno]].\n\n== Culture and attractions ==\nCurrie has two Scout Groups - the 31st Pentland which has run continuously since 1924 and the 42nd Pentland.\n\nCurrie is a District of Girlguiding Edinburgh.  1st Currie Guides have run continuously since 1921, and 1st Currie Brownies continually since 1933.\n\nOn the first Saturday of May The Currie Riding of the Marches takes place.\n\n== Local History Society ==\n\nCurrie and District Local History Society meets 12 times a year and has speakers on all aspects of the area.\n\nThe society meets every first and third Monday in the month and their year starts in October.\nThe venue is in the Gibson Craig Hall on the Lanark Road in Currie.\n\n==Ethnicity==\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

It was designed by Sir [[Robert Lorimer]] and added in 1921.<ref>Dictionary of Scottish Architects: Robert Lorimer</ref>\n\nBelow the site of the church close to the Water of Leith is St Mungo's Holy Well with its stone basin and side walls.\n\n===Ministers===\n*Rev James Craig in 1780s<ref>williamsons Street Directory 1784</ref>\n*Rev James Dick ministered 1792 to 1815<ref>Grave of Rev James Dick, Currie Kirkyard</ref>\n*Rev Dr James Langwill ministered 1859 to 1898<ref>Memorial to James Langwill in Currie Kirk</ref>\n\n===Notable Interments===\n*[[Alick Buchanan-Smith, Baron Balerno]] (1898-1984)\n*[[Alick Buchanan-Smith (1932\u20131991)|Alick Laidlaw Buchanan-Smith]] MP (1932-1991)\n*Sir [[Stanley Davidson]] (1894-1981) Professor of Medicine\n*William Henderson (1766-1842) co-founder of [[Scottish Widows]] (large obelisk to the north-west of the churchyard)\n*Dr [[Robert Cranston Low]] MD FRCPE [[FRSE]] (1879-1949) medical author\n*Dr [[Alexander Morison]] (1779-1866)\n*[[Ochterlony baronets|Sir David Ferguson Ochterlony]] (1848-1931) 3rd Baronet Ochterlony\n*Sir [[George Adam Smith]] (1856-1942) including a memorial to his daughter, [[Janet Adam Smith]]\n*Brigadier General Ernest Craig Brown, who gives his name to the military march \"Captain Craig Brown\"<ref>https://boxandfiddlearchive.weebly.com/captain-craig-brown.html</ref>\n\n== Famous residents ==\n\n* [[Stephen Carter, Baron Carter of Barnes]]\n* [[Jamie Dick]] - Youth Olympic Gold Medalist in Curling\n* [[Kate Green]] - Labour MP\n* [[Dougal Haston]] - pioneer of Scottish mountaineering\n* [[Matthew Lloyd]] - Australian Rules footballer, [[Essendon Football Club|Essendon]]\n* [[Maitland Moir|John Henry Maitland Moir]] - Archimndrite, Greek Orthodox Church of St Andrew\n* [[Matt Scott (rugby union)|Matt Scott]] - Scottish international Rugby Union player\n* [[James Thomson (weaver poet)]]\n*Paul Research and John Mackie of post-punk band [[Scars (band)|The Scars]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.edinburghgigarchive.com/page31.htm|title=The Edinburgh Gig Archive - Odds & Ends|website=www.edinburghgigarchive.com|language=en|access-date=2018-08-07}}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n*[[Heriot-Watt University]]\n*[[Currie High School]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\nhttps://web.archive.org/web/20100329115029/http://www.curriechs.co.uk/ [last accessed 26 Feb 1013]\n\n== External links ==\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20110903142315/http://www.currie-scc.gov.uk/ Currie Community Council]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20100329115029/http://www.curriechs.co.uk/ Currie Community High School]\n*[http://www.currierugby.org Currie Rugby Football Club]\n*[http://www.hw.ac.uk Heriot-Watt University]\n*[http://www.currie-pri.edin.sch.uk Currie Primary School]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20100609065108/http://www.ltscotland.org.uk/scottishschoolsonline/schools/nethercurrieprimaryschooledinburghcity.asp Nether Currie Primary's page on Scottish Schools Online]\n*[http://www.curriehistory.org Currie and District Local history Society]\n*[http://www.nethercurrie.edin.sch.uk Nether Currie Primary School]\n*[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T4t4WGIDAJo St Mungo's Well]\n*[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQ0tSJqr_QU Curriehill railway station]\n{{Areas of Edinburgh}}\n\n[[Category:Areas of Edinburgh]]\n[[Category:Parishes formerly in Midlothian]]\n", "name_user": "Bellowhead678", "label": "safe", "comment": "Archimndrite->Archimandrite -Fix a typo in one click", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Currie"}

The treaty was signed by Queen Mar\u00eda de Molina, as the [[regent]] of Castile on behalf of her son, Ferdinand IV, who was still a minor, and King Denis of Portugal. To reinforce the peace, the agreement included clauses arranging the marriages of King Ferdinand and [[Constance of Portugal]] and that of her brother, Afonso, with Beatrice; that is, the marriage of two siblings, infantes of Portugal, with two other siblings, infantes of Castile.{{Sfn|Rodrigues Oliveira|2010|p=215}}{{Sfn|Louren\u00e7o Menino|2008|pp=350-351}}{{Sfn|Gonz\u00e1lez M\u00ednguez|2004|p=228\u2013229}}{{refn|group=lower-alpha|The marriage of Ferdinand and Constance had been negotiated in a previous agreement signed on 15 September 1291.
