(2002)</ref> A 1999 study by [[Bencie Woll]] suggested that IS signers often use a large amount of vocabulary from their native language,<ref>Sutton-Spence, Rachel and Woll, Bencie.

This suggests that the majority of IS signs are not signs borrowed from a specific SL, as other studies found, but rather are common to many natural SLs. Only 2% of IS signs were found to be unique to IS. The remaining 38% were borrowed (or \"loan\") signs that could be traced back to one SL or a group of related SLs.<ref>Rosenstock, [[Op cit]].</ref> </blockquote>International Sign has a simplified lexicon. In IS for example, the English \u201cwho\u201d, \u201cwhat\u201d, and \u201chow\u201d are all translated simply to \u201cwhat\u201d. Another example of this simplified lexicon is the location of the sign itself. IS will use movements from the chest to indicate feeling signs, and signs near the head will indicate knowledge.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Rosenstock|first=Rachel|date=2008|title=The Role of Iconicity in International Sign|journal=Sign Language Studies|language=en|volume=8|issue=2|pages=131\u2013159|doi=10.1353/sls.2008.0003|issn=1533-6263}}</ref> There have been several attempt at making dictionaries for IS. However, these lack detailed information on data collection, nor do they describe the exact meaning or how the signs should be used. This causes difficulty for training and teaching people in IS, as there is no empirical evidence.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n==Grammar==\nVery little is known about the grammar of IS.<ref name=\":4\" /> It tends to use fewer [[Mouthing|mouthings]] and often has a larger signing space. The use of mouth gestures for adverbials is emphasized.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\nPeople communicating in IS tend to make heavy use of role play, as well as a feature common to most sign languages researched to date: an extensive [[formal system]] of [[classifier handshape|classifier]]s. Classifiers are used to describe things, and they transfer well across linguistic barriers. It has been noted that signers are generally better at interlingual communication than non-signers, even without a [[lingua franca]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2019}}\n\nA paper presented in 1994 suggested that IS signers \"combine a relatively rich and structured grammar with a severely impoverished lexicon\".<ref>Allsop, Lorna; Woll, Bencie; Brauti, John Martin (1995).

This suggests that the majority of IS signs are not signs borrowed from a specific SL, as other studies found, but rather are common to many natural SLs. Only 2% of IS signs were found to be unique to IS. The remaining 38% were borrowed (or \"loan\") signs that could be traced back to one SL or a group of related SLs.<ref>Rosenstock, [[Op cit]].</ref> </blockquote>International Sign has a simplified lexicon. In IS for example, the English \u201cwho\u201d, \u201cwhat\u201d, and \u201chow\u201d are all translated simply to \u201cwhat\u201d. Another example of this simplified lexicon is the location of the sign itself. IS will use movements from the chest to indicate feeling signs, and signs near the head will indicate knowledge.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Rosenstock|first=Rachel|date=2008|title=The Role of Iconicity in International Sign|journal=Sign Language Studies|language=en|volume=8|issue=2|pages=131\u2013159|doi=10.1353/sls.2008.0003|issn=1533-6263}}</ref> There have been several attempt at making dictionaries for IS.

In some countries, such as Sri Lanka and Tanzania, each school for the deaf may have a separate language, known only to its students and sometimes denied by the school; on the other hand, countries may share sign languages, although sometimes under different names (Croatian and Serbian, Indian and Pakistani). Deaf sign languages also arise outside educational institutions, especially in village communities with high levels of congenital deafness, but there are significant sign languages developed for the hearing as well, such as the speech-taboo languages used in aboriginal Australia.

Another struggle that the Deaf community often faces is that educational institutions usually consist primarily of hearing people. Additionally, hearing family members may need to learn sign language in order for the deaf person to feel included and supported. Unlike some other cultures, a deaf person may join the community later in life, rather than needing to be born into it.<ref>{{Cite book|title = Deafness in Society|last = Nash|first = Jeffrey E.|publisher = LexingtonBooks|year = 1981|isbn = |location = Toronto|pages = 100\u2013102|last2 = Nash|first2 = Anedith}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Three views.webm|thumb|Three views on Deaf people]]\n[[File:Cochlear-implant-external-part.jpg|thumb|Cochlear Implant - A surgically implanted device used by Deaf and hard-of-hearing people to improve hearing.]]\nThere are several perspectives on deaf people and Deaf culture that shape their treatment and role in society. From a medical standpoint, many encourage Deaf children to undergo surgery. Especially in the past, the medical perspective discouraged the use of sign language because they believed it would distract from development of auditory and speech skills. From a social standpoint, Deaf individuals are welcomed to participate in society in the same manner as any other individual. This view discourages the idea that those who are deaf or [[Hearing loss|hard-of-hearing]] are sick and in need of a cure. The social view also encourages making accommodations for deaf people so that they can fully participate in society. Such accommodations include the use of interpreters or improved closed captioning systems. Many feel, however, that the social view fails to recognize the unique qualities of Deaf people and Deaf culture. They believe that this perspective asks Deaf people to fit and find their own way in a predominantly hearing society, instead of recognizing their own abilities and culture. Another perspective is referred to as the [[Cultural linguistics|cultural-linguistic]] view. Supporters of Deaf Culture state that this perspective appropriately recognizes Deaf people as a minority culture in the world with their own language and social norms. This standpoint is believed to promote Deaf people's right to collective space within society to pass on their language and culture to future generations.<ref name=\":0\">Lane, Harlan L.; Richard Pillard; Ulf Hedberg (2011).

Due to the origins of deaf education in the United States, [[American Sign Language]] is most closely related to [[French Sign Language]].\nSign language is just one part of deaf culture. Deaf identity is also constructed around specific beliefs, values and art.\n\n===Values and beliefs===\n* A positive attitude towards deafness is typical in Deaf cultural groups. Deafness is not generally considered a condition that needs to be fixed.<ref name=\"mindess2006\" /> \n* The term \"Deaf Gain\" is used by Deaf people, to re-frame the perceived losses of Deafness and \"hearing loss\" to highlight the benefits of being deaf. According to deaf scientist [[Michele Cooke]], it describes the benefits that Deaf people provide the larger community.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.umass.edu/magazine/fall-2018/what-my-deaf-way-science|title=What is my deaf way of science?|last=egallant|date=2018-10-11|website=UMass Magazine|language=en|access-date=2020-04-09}}</ref>\n* The use of a sign language is central to Deaf cultural identity. Oralist approaches to educating deaf children thereby pose a threat to the continued existence of Deaf culture. Some members of Deaf communities may also oppose technological innovations like [[cochlear implant]]s for the same reason.\n* Culturally, Deaf people value the use of natural sign languages that exhibit their own grammatical conventions, such as [[American Sign Language]] and [[British Sign Language]], over signed versions of English or other oral languages. Spoken English, written English and [[Signing Exact English|signed English]] are three different symbolic systems for expressing the same language.<ref>{{Cite book|title = Deaf Heritage\u2013A Narrative History of Deaf America|last = Gannon|first = Jack R|publisher = National Association of the Deaf|year = 1981|isbn = 978-0-913072-38-7|location = Silver Spring, MD|pages = [https://archive.org/details/deafheritagenarr0000gann/page/378 378]|url = https://archive.org/details/deafheritagenarr0000gann/page/378}}</ref>\n* Deaf communities strongly oppose discrimination against deaf people.\n* Deaf culture in the United States tends to be collectivist rather than individualist; culturally Deaf people value the group.<ref name=\"mindess2006\" />\n\n===Behavioral patterns===\n* Culturally Deaf people have rules of etiquette for getting attention, walking through signed conversations, leave-taking, and otherwise politely negotiating a signing environment.\n* Deaf people also keep each other informed of what is going on in one's environment. It is common to provide detailed information when leaving early or arriving late; withholding such information may be considered rude.<ref name=\"mindess2006\" />\n* Deaf people may be more direct or blunt than their hearing counterparts.<ref name=\"mindess2006\" />\n* When giving introductions, Deaf people typically try to find common ground; since the Deaf community is relatively small, Deaf people usually have other Deaf people in common.<ref name=\"mindess2006\" />\n* Deaf people may also consider time differently. Showing up early to large-scale events, such as lectures, is typical. This may be motivated by the need to get a seat that provides the best visual clarity for the Deaf person.\n\n===Importance of technology===\n*Like all other people, Deaf individuals rely on technology for communication significantly. In the United States, [[video relay service]]s and an array of freestanding and software-driven video phones are often used by deaf people to conduct telephonic communication with hearing and deaf businesses, family and friends. Devices such as the teletype (known as a TTY, an electronic device used for communication over a telephone line) are far less common, but are used by some deaf people who are without access to high-speed Internet or have a preference for these methods for their telephonic communication.\n*Technology is even important in face-to-face social situations. For example, when deaf people meet a hearing person who does not know sign language, they often communicate via the notepad on their cell phones. Here, technology takes the place of a human sense, allowing deaf individuals to successfully communicate with different cultures.\n*Social media tends to be of great importance to deaf individuals. Networking sites allow deaf people to find each other and to remain in contact. Many deaf people have deaf friends throughout the entire country that they met or maintain contact with through online communities.  Because the deaf community is so small, for many deaf people, the stigma of meeting others online does not exist.\n*Closed Captioning must be available on a television in order for a deaf person to fully appreciate the audio portion of the broadcast. Conflicts arise when establishments such as restaurants, airlines, or fitness centers fail to accommodate deaf people by turning on Closed Captioning. Movie theaters are increasingly compliant with providing visual access to first-run movies through stand-alone devices, glasses and open caption technology which allow deaf people to attend movies as they are released.<ref>{{cite web|url = https://www.npr.org/blogs/alltechconsidered/2013/05/12/183218751/new-closed-captioning-glasses-help-deaf-go-out-to-the-movies|title = New Closed-Captioning Glasses Help Deaf Go Out to the Movies : All Tech Considered|publisher = NPR|accessdate = 2015-04-12|date = May 12, 2013|last = Rood|first = Rachel}}</ref>\n*Alert systems such as fire alarms and alarm clocks must appeal to different senses in order for a deaf individual to notice the alert. Objects such as vibrating pillows and flashing lights often take the place of the noise-based alarms.\n*Lack of understanding about technological accessibility for the deaf causes conflict and injustice for the deaf community. For example, a significant number of deaf individuals in the UK admit that they are dissatisfied with their banks because of their heavy reliance on telephone banking and lack of assistance to deaf and hard-of-hearing individuals.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.actiononhearingloss.org.uk/news-and-events/all-regions/press-releases/banks-face-massive-payouts-to-deaf-customers.aspx|title = Banks face massive payouts to deaf customers|publisher = Action on Hearing Loss / RNID|date = 2012-02-21|accessdate = 2015-04-12|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20130604102110/http://www.actiononhearingloss.org.uk/news-and-events/all-regions/press-releases/banks-face-massive-payouts-to-deaf-customers.aspx?jse=1|archivedate = 2013-06-04}}</ref>\n*Architecture that is conducive to signed communication minimizes visual obstructions and may include such things as automatic sliding doors to free up the hands for continuous conversation.<ref>{{cite thesis|last=Tsymbal |first=Karina |year=2010 |title=Deaf Space and the Visual World \u2013 Buildings That Speak: An Elementary School For The Deaf |hdl=1903/11295 |publisher=University of Maryland |type=MArch}}</ref>\n\n===Literary traditions and the arts===\n{{main|American Sign Language literature}}\nA strong tradition of poetry and storytelling exists in American Sign Language and other sign languages.

The intent of the [[oralism|oralist]] method was to teach deaf children to speak and [[lip reading|lip read]] with limited or no use of sign language in the classroom in order to make it easier for deaf children to integrate into hearing communities, but the benefits of learning in such an environment are disputed. The Milan conference recommendations were repudiated in Hamburg a century later,<ref>Brill, Richard G. 1984. ''International Congresses on Education of the Deaf--An Analytical History, 1878-1980'', Washington, D.C.: Gallaudet College Press, p. 25.</ref> and sign languages in education came back into vogue after the publication of Stokoe's linguistic analyses of ASL.\n\n===Shared institutions===\n[[File:ArtClassStateSchooloftheDeafDelavanWisconsin.jpg|thumb|right|Women's art class at State School of the Deaf, Delavan, Wisconsin, c. 1880]]\nDeaf culture revolves around such institutions as residential schools for deaf students, universities for deaf students (including [[Gallaudet University]] and the [[National Technical Institute for the Deaf]]), deaf clubs, deaf athletic leagues, communal homes (such as The Home for Aged and Infirm Deaf-Mutes, founded by [[Jane Middleton]], in New York City), deaf social organizations (such as the Deaf Professional Happy Hour), deaf religious groups, deaf theaters, and an array of conferences and festivals, such as the Deaf Way II Conference and Festival and the [[World Federation of the Deaf]] conferences.\n\nDeaf clubs, popular in the 1940s and 1950s, were also an important part of deaf culture. During this time there were very few places that the deaf could call their own\u2013 places run by deaf people for deaf people. Deaf clubs were the solution to this need. Money was made by selling alcohol and hosting card games. Sometimes these ventures were so successful that the building used by the club was able to be purchased. However, the main attraction of these clubs was that they provided a place that deaf people could go to be around other deaf people, sometimes sharing stories, hosting parties, comedians, and plays. Many of today's common ABC stories were first seen at deaf clubs. The clubs were found in all of the major cities, New York City being home to at least 12. These clubs were an important break from their usually solitary day spent at factory jobs.<ref name=bauman2008 />\n\nIn the 1960s, deaf clubs began their quick and drastic decline. Today there are only a few spread-out deaf clubs found in the United States and their attendance is commonly small with a tendency to the elderly. This sudden decline is often attributed to the rise of technology like the TTY and [[closed captioning]] for personal TVs. With other options available for entertainment and communication, the need for deaf clubs grew smaller. It was no longer the only option for getting in touch with other members of the deaf community.<ref name=bauman2008 />\n\nHowever, others attribute the decline of deaf clubs to the end of [[World War&nbsp;II]] and a change in the job market. During WWII there was high demand for factory laborers and a promise of high pay. Many deaf Americans left their homes to move to bigger cities with the hope of obtaining a factory job. This huge influx of workers into new cities created the need for deaf clubs. When World War&nbsp;II ended and the civil rights movement progressed, the federal government started offering more jobs to deaf men and women. People began switching from manufacturing jobs to service jobs, moving away from solitary work with set hours. Today, deaf clubs are rare, but deaf advocacy centers and other deaf organizations have become widespread and popular.<ref name=bauman2008 />\n\n====Deaf African-American institutions====\nThe [[National Black Deaf Advocates]] was established in 1982 \"to promote the leadership development, economic and educational opportunities, social equality, and to safeguard the general health and welfare of Black deaf and hard-of-hearing people.\"<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.nbda.org/content/about-us|title = About Us|website = National Black Deaf Advocates|accessdate = 2015-04-12}}</ref>\n\n====Deaf LGBT institutions====\nThe Rainbow Alliance of the Deaf is a nonprofit established in 1977 to, \"establish and maintain a society of Deaf [[GLBT|LGBT]] to encourage and promote the educational, economical, and social welfare; to foster fellowship; to defend our rights; and advance our interests as Deaf GLBT citizens concerning social justice; to build up an organization in which all worthy members may participate in the discussion of practical problems and solutions related to their social welfare.

Over the last few decades, libraries in the United States have begun to implement services and collections for Deaf patrons and are working harder every year to make more of their collections, services, their communities, and even the world more accessible. {{Citation needed|date=December 2014}}\n\nThe [[American Library Association]] considers disabled people, including the Deaf, as a minority that is often overlooked by library staff.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ala.org/ascla/asclaissues/libraryservices |title=Library Services for People with Disabilities Policy &#124; Association of Specialized & Cooperative Library Agencies (ASCLA) |publisher=Ala.org |date=2001-01-16 |accessdate=2015-04-17}}</ref> However, in the last few decades, libraries across the United States have made improvements in library accessibility in general and to the Deaf community specifically.{{Citation needed|date=December 2015}}\n\nOne of the first activists in the library community working toward accessibility for the Deaf was [[Alice Hagemeyer]]. When disabled communities began demanding equality in the 1970s, Hagemeyer decided to go back to school for her master's degree in library science. While she was studying there, she realized that there was not very much information about the Deaf community at her library or at the libraries of any of her classmates. She soon became an activist for Deaf awareness at her library, and she became the first \"Librarian for the Deaf Community\" from any public library in the nation. Hagemeyer also constructed a manual of resources for Deaf people and those associated with them called The Red Notebook. This notebook is now an online resource, which is available at the website of the Friends of Libraries for Deaf Action. Hagemeyer was one of the first library activists to make strides for the Deaf community.<ref>Hagemeyer, A. L. (2001). Achievement: From a lack of knowledge to an appreciation of Deaf history.

IFLA's ''Guidelines for Library Services to Deaf People'' is one such set of guidelines, and it was published to inform libraries of the services that should be provided for Deaf patrons. Most of the guidelines pertain to ensuring that Deaf patrons have equal access to all available library services. Other guidelines include training library staff to provide services for the Deaf community, availability of text telephones or TTYs not only to assist patrons with reference questions but also for making outside calls, using the most recent technology in order to communicate more effectively with Deaf patrons, including closed captioning services for any television services, and developing a collection that would interest the members of the Deaf community.<ref>Day, J. M. (2000). Guidelines for library services to deaf people (Report no. 62). The Hague: International Federation of Library Associations and Institutions.</ref>\n\nOver the years, library services have begun to evolve in order to accommodate the needs and desires of local Deaf communities. At the Queens Borough Public Library (QBPL) in New York, the staff implemented new and innovative ideas in order to involve the community and library staff with the Deaf people in their community. The QBPL hired a deaf librarian, Lori Stambler, to train the library staff about Deaf culture, to teach sign language classes for family members and people who are involved with deaf people, and to teach literacy classes for Deaf patrons. In working with the library, Stambler was able to help the community reach out to its deaf neighbors, and helped other deaf people become more active in their outside community.<ref>Hollander, P.

The library's collection has grown from a small number of reference books to the world's largest collection of deaf-related materials with over 234,000 books and thousands of other materials in different formats. The library created a hybrid classification system based on an extension of the [[Dewey decimal system]] because traditional Dewey was not fine-grained enough to handle thousands of books in relatively small classification areas such as [[audiology]] or Deaf communication.<ref name=\"Harrington-1998\" />{{rp|9}} The library also houses the university's archives, which holds some of the oldest deaf-related books and documents in the world.<ref name=\"Harrington-1998\">Harrington, T.R.

Another struggle that the Deaf community often faces is that educational institutions usually consist primarily of hearing people. Additionally, hearing family members may need to learn sign language in order for the deaf person to feel included and supported. Unlike some other cultures, a deaf person may join the community later in life, rather than needing to be born into it.<ref>{{Cite book|title = Deafness in Society|last = Nash|first = Jeffrey E.|publisher = LexingtonBooks|year = 1981|isbn = |location = Toronto|pages = 100\u2013102|last2 = Nash|first2 = Anedith}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Three views.webm|thumb|Three views on Deaf people]]\n[[File:Cochlear-implant-external-part.jpg|thumb|Cochlear Implant - A surgically implanted device used by Deaf and hard-of-hearing people to improve hearing.]]\nThere are several perspectives on deaf people and Deaf culture that shape their treatment and role in society. From a medical standpoint, many encourage Deaf children to undergo surgery. Especially in the past, the medical perspective discouraged the use of sign language because they believed it would distract from development of auditory and speech skills. From a social standpoint, Deaf individuals are welcomed to participate in society in the same manner as any other individual. This view discourages the idea that those who are deaf or [[Hearing loss|hard-of-hearing]] are sick and in need of a cure. The social view also encourages making accommodations for deaf people so that they can fully participate in society. Such accommodations include the use of interpreters or improved closed captioning systems. Many feel, however, that the social view fails to recognize the unique qualities of Deaf people and Deaf culture. They believe that this perspective asks Deaf people to fit and find their own way in a predominantly hearing society, instead of recognizing their own abilities and culture. Another perspective is referred to as the [[Cultural linguistics|cultural-linguistic]] view. Supporters of Deaf Culture state that this perspective appropriately recognizes Deaf people as a minority culture in the world with their own language and social norms. This standpoint is believed to promote Deaf people's right to collective space within society to pass on their language and culture to future generations.<ref name=\":0\">Lane, Harlan L.; Richard Pillard; Ulf Hedberg (2011).

Deaf identity also intersects with other kinds of [[cultural identity]]. Deaf culture intersects with nationality, education, race, ethnicity, gender, class, sexual orientation, and other identity markers, leading to a culture that is at once quite small and also tremendously diverse.  The extent to which people identify primarily with their deaf identity rather than their membership in other intersecting cultural groups also varies. Mindess notes a 1989 study, which found that \"87 percent of black deaf people polled identified with their black culture first\".<ref name=\"mindess2006\" />\n\n\n== Education ==\n\nDeaf culture is prevalent in schools for the deaf.

There are [[List of sign languages|over 200 distinct sign languages in the world]]. These include 114 sign languages listed in the Ethnologue database and 157 more sign languages, systems, and dialects.<ref>{{cite web|last = Harrington|first = Thomas|title = Sign language of the world by name|url = http://libguides.gallaudet.edu/content.php?pid=114804&sid=991940|publisher = Gallaudet University Library|accessdate = 24 July 2012}}</ref><ref>Harrington, Thomas. \"Sign language of the world by name.\" n. page. Print.</ref> While the [[United Kingdom]] and the [[United States]] are both predominantly [[English language|English]] speaking, the predominant signed languages used in these countries differ markedly. Due to the origins of deaf education in the United States, [[American Sign Language]] is most closely related to [[French Sign Language]].\nSign language is just one part of deaf culture. Deaf identity is also constructed around specific beliefs, values and art.\n\n===Values and beliefs===\n* A positive attitude towards deafness is typical in Deaf cultural groups. Deafness is not generally considered a condition that needs to be fixed.<ref name=\"mindess2006\" /> \n* The term \"Deaf Gain\" is used by Deaf people, to re-frame the perceived losses of Deafness and \"hearing loss\" to highlight the benefits of being deaf. According to deaf scientist [[Michele Cooke]], it describes the benefits that Deaf people provide the larger community.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.umass.edu/magazine/fall-2018/what-my-deaf-way-science|title=What is my deaf way of science?|last=egallant|date=2018-10-11|website=UMass Magazine|language=en|access-date=2020-04-09}}</ref>\n* The use of a sign language is central to Deaf cultural identity. Oralist approaches to educating deaf children thereby pose a threat to the continued existence of Deaf culture. Some members of Deaf communities may also oppose technological innovations like [[cochlear implant]]s for the same reason.\n* Culturally, Deaf people value the use of natural sign languages that exhibit their own grammatical conventions, such as [[American Sign Language]] and [[British Sign Language]], over signed versions of English or other oral languages. Spoken English, written English and [[Signing Exact English|signed English]] are three different symbolic systems for expressing the same language.<ref>{{Cite book|title = Deaf Heritage\u2013A Narrative History of Deaf America|last = Gannon|first = Jack R|publisher = National Association of the Deaf|year = 1981|isbn = 978-0-913072-38-7|location = Silver Spring, MD|pages = [https://archive.org/details/deafheritagenarr0000gann/page/378 378]|url = https://archive.org/details/deafheritagenarr0000gann/page/378}}</ref>\n* Deaf communities strongly oppose discrimination against deaf people.\n* Deaf culture in the United States tends to be collectivist rather than individualist; culturally Deaf people value the group.<ref name=\"mindess2006\" />\n\n===Behavioral patterns===\n* Culturally Deaf people have rules of etiquette for getting attention, walking through signed conversations, leave-taking, and otherwise politely negotiating a signing environment.\n* Deaf people also keep each other informed of what is going on in one's environment. It is common to provide detailed information when leaving early or arriving late; withholding such information may be considered rude.<ref name=\"mindess2006\" />\n* Deaf people may be more direct or blunt than their hearing counterparts.<ref name=\"mindess2006\" />\n* When giving introductions, Deaf people typically try to find common ground; since the Deaf community is relatively small, Deaf people usually have other Deaf people in common.<ref name=\"mindess2006\" />\n* Deaf people may also consider time differently. Showing up early to large-scale events, such as lectures, is typical. This may be motivated by the need to get a seat that provides the best visual clarity for the Deaf person.\n\n===Importance of technology===\n*Like all other people, Deaf individuals rely on technology for communication significantly. In the United States, [[video relay service]]s and an array of freestanding and software-driven video phones are often used by deaf people to conduct telephonic communication with hearing and deaf businesses, family and friends. Devices such as the teletype (known as a TTY, an electronic device used for communication over a telephone line) are far less common, but are used by some deaf people who are without access to high-speed Internet or have a preference for these methods for their telephonic communication.\n*Technology is even important in face-to-face social situations. For example, when deaf people meet a hearing person who does not know sign language, they often communicate via the notepad on their cell phones. Here, technology takes the place of a human sense, allowing deaf individuals to successfully communicate with different cultures.\n*Social media tends to be of great importance to deaf individuals. Networking sites allow deaf people to find each other and to remain in contact. Many deaf people have deaf friends throughout the entire country that they met or maintain contact with through online communities.  Because the deaf community is so small, for many deaf people, the stigma of meeting others online does not exist.\n*Closed Captioning must be available on a television in order for a deaf person to fully appreciate the audio portion of the broadcast. Conflicts arise when establishments such as restaurants, airlines, or fitness centers fail to accommodate deaf people by turning on Closed Captioning. Movie theaters are increasingly compliant with providing visual access to first-run movies through stand-alone devices, glasses and open caption technology which allow deaf people to attend movies as they are released.<ref>{{cite web|url = https://www.npr.org/blogs/alltechconsidered/2013/05/12/183218751/new-closed-captioning-glasses-help-deaf-go-out-to-the-movies|title = New Closed-Captioning Glasses Help Deaf Go Out to the Movies : All Tech Considered|publisher = NPR|accessdate = 2015-04-12|date = May 12, 2013|last = Rood|first = Rachel}}</ref>\n*Alert systems such as fire alarms and alarm clocks must appeal to different senses in order for a deaf individual to notice the alert. Objects such as vibrating pillows and flashing lights often take the place of the noise-based alarms.\n*Lack of understanding about technological accessibility for the deaf causes conflict and injustice for the deaf community. For example, a significant number of deaf individuals in the UK admit that they are dissatisfied with their banks because of their heavy reliance on telephone banking and lack of assistance to deaf and hard-of-hearing individuals.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.actiononhearingloss.org.uk/news-and-events/all-regions/press-releases/banks-face-massive-payouts-to-deaf-customers.aspx|title = Banks face massive payouts to deaf customers|publisher = Action on Hearing Loss / RNID|date = 2012-02-21|accessdate = 2015-04-12|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20130604102110/http://www.actiononhearingloss.org.uk/news-and-events/all-regions/press-releases/banks-face-massive-payouts-to-deaf-customers.aspx?jse=1|archivedate = 2013-06-04}}</ref>\n*Architecture that is conducive to signed communication minimizes visual obstructions and may include such things as automatic sliding doors to free up the hands for continuous conversation.<ref>{{cite thesis|last=Tsymbal |first=Karina |year=2010 |title=Deaf Space and the Visual World \u2013 Buildings That Speak: An Elementary School For The Deaf |hdl=1903/11295 |publisher=University of Maryland |type=MArch}}</ref>\n\n===Literary traditions and the arts===\n{{main|American Sign Language literature}}\nA strong tradition of poetry and storytelling exists in American Sign Language and other sign languages.

The intent of the [[oralism|oralist]] method was to teach deaf children to speak and [[lip reading|lip read]] with limited or no use of sign language in the classroom in order to make it easier for deaf children to integrate into hearing communities, but the benefits of learning in such an environment are disputed. The Milan conference recommendations were repudiated in Hamburg a century later,<ref>Brill, Richard G. 1984. ''International Congresses on Education of the Deaf--An Analytical History, 1878-1980'', Washington, D.C.: Gallaudet College Press, p. 25.</ref> and sign languages in education came back into vogue after the publication of Stokoe's linguistic analyses of ASL.\n\n===Shared institutions===\n[[File:ArtClassStateSchooloftheDeafDelavanWisconsin.jpg|thumb|right|Women's art class at State School of the Deaf, Delavan, Wisconsin, c. 1880]]\nDeaf culture revolves around such institutions as residential schools for deaf students, universities for deaf students (including [[Gallaudet University]] and the [[National Technical Institute for the Deaf]]), deaf clubs, deaf athletic leagues, communal homes (such as The Home for Aged and Infirm Deaf-Mutes, founded by [[Jane Middleton]], in New York City), deaf social organizations (such as the Deaf Professional Happy Hour), deaf religious groups, deaf theaters, and an array of conferences and festivals, such as the Deaf Way II Conference and Festival and the [[World Federation of the Deaf]] conferences.\n\nDeaf clubs, popular in the 1940s and 1950s, were also an important part of deaf culture. During this time there were very few places that the deaf could call their own\u2013 places run by deaf people for deaf people. Deaf clubs were the solution to this need. Money was made by selling alcohol and hosting card games. Sometimes these ventures were so successful that the building used by the club was able to be purchased. However, the main attraction of these clubs was that they provided a place that deaf people could go to be around other deaf people, sometimes sharing stories, hosting parties, comedians, and plays. Many of today's common ABC stories were first seen at deaf clubs. The clubs were found in all of the major cities, New York City being home to at least 12. These clubs were an important break from their usually solitary day spent at factory jobs.<ref name=bauman2008 />\n\nIn the 1960s, deaf clubs began their quick and drastic decline. Today there are only a few spread-out deaf clubs found in the United States and their attendance is commonly small with a tendency to the elderly. This sudden decline is often attributed to the rise of technology like the TTY and [[closed captioning]] for personal TVs. With other options available for entertainment and communication, the need for deaf clubs grew smaller. It was no longer the only option for getting in touch with other members of the deaf community.<ref name=bauman2008 />\n\nHowever, others attribute the decline of deaf clubs to the end of [[World War&nbsp;II]] and a change in the job market. During WWII there was high demand for factory laborers and a promise of high pay. Many deaf Americans left their homes to move to bigger cities with the hope of obtaining a factory job. This huge influx of workers into new cities created the need for deaf clubs. When World War&nbsp;II ended and the civil rights movement progressed, the federal government started offering more jobs to deaf men and women. People began switching from manufacturing jobs to service jobs, moving away from solitary work with set hours. Today, deaf clubs are rare, but deaf advocacy centers and other deaf organizations have become widespread and popular.<ref name=bauman2008 />\n\n====Deaf African-American institutions====\nThe [[National Black Deaf Advocates]] was established in 1982 \"to promote the leadership development, economic and educational opportunities, social equality, and to safeguard the general health and welfare of Black deaf and hard-of-hearing people.\"<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.nbda.org/content/about-us|title = About Us|website = National Black Deaf Advocates|accessdate = 2015-04-12}}</ref>\n\n====Deaf LGBT institutions====\nThe Rainbow Alliance of the Deaf is a nonprofit established in 1977 to, \"establish and maintain a society of Deaf [[GLBT|LGBT]] to encourage and promote the educational, economical, and social welfare; to foster fellowship; to defend our rights; and advance our interests as Deaf GLBT citizens concerning social justice; to build up an organization in which all worthy members may participate in the discussion of practical problems and solutions related to their social welfare.

Over the last few decades, libraries in the United States have begun to implement services and collections for Deaf patrons and are working harder every year to make more of their collections, services, their communities, and even the world more accessible. {{Citation needed|date=December 2014}}\n\nThe [[American Library Association]] considers disabled people, including the Deaf, as a minority that is often overlooked by library staff.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ala.org/ascla/asclaissues/libraryservices |title=Library Services for People with Disabilities Policy &#124; Association of Specialized & Cooperative Library Agencies (ASCLA) |publisher=Ala.org |date=2001-01-16 |accessdate=2015-04-17}}</ref> However, in the last few decades, libraries across the United States have made improvements in library accessibility in general and to the Deaf community specifically.{{Citation needed|date=December 2015}}\n\nOne of the first activists in the library community working toward accessibility for the Deaf was [[Alice Hagemeyer]]. When disabled communities began demanding equality in the 1970s, Hagemeyer decided to go back to school for her master's degree in library science. While she was studying there, she realized that there was not very much information about the Deaf community at her library or at the libraries of any of her classmates. She soon became an activist for Deaf awareness at her library, and she became the first \"Librarian for the Deaf Community\" from any public library in the nation. Hagemeyer also constructed a manual of resources for Deaf people and those associated with them called The Red Notebook. This notebook is now an online resource, which is available at the website of the Friends of Libraries for Deaf Action. Hagemeyer was one of the first library activists to make strides for the Deaf community.<ref>Hagemeyer, A. L. (2001). Achievement: From a lack of knowledge to an appreciation of Deaf history. IFLA Conference Proceedings, 1\u20133.</ref>\n\nAustralian librarian Karen McQuigg states that \"even ten years ago, when I was involved in a project looking at what public libraries could offer the deaf, it seemed as if the gap between the requirements of this group and what public libraries could offer was too great for public libraries to be able to serve them effectively.\"<ref>{{cite journal|last = McQuigg|date = August 2003|title = Are the deaf a disabled group, or a linguistic minority?

IFLA's ''Guidelines for Library Services to Deaf People'' is one such set of guidelines, and it was published to inform libraries of the services that should be provided for Deaf patrons. Most of the guidelines pertain to ensuring that Deaf patrons have equal access to all available library services. Other guidelines include training library staff to provide services for the Deaf community, availability of text telephones or TTYs not only to assist patrons with reference questions but also for making outside calls, using the most recent technology in order to communicate more effectively with Deaf patrons, including closed captioning services for any television services, and developing a collection that would interest the members of the Deaf community.<ref>Day, J. M. (2000). Guidelines for library services to deaf people (Report no. 62). The Hague: International Federation of Library Associations and Institutions.</ref>\n\nOver the years, library services have begun to evolve in order to accommodate the needs and desires of local Deaf communities. At the Queens Borough Public Library (QBPL) in New York, the staff implemented new and innovative ideas in order to involve the community and library staff with the Deaf people in their community. The QBPL hired a deaf librarian, Lori Stambler, to train the library staff about Deaf culture, to teach sign language classes for family members and people who are involved with deaf people, and to teach literacy classes for Deaf patrons. In working with the library, Stambler was able to help the community reach out to its deaf neighbors, and helped other deaf people become more active in their outside community.<ref>Hollander, P. (1995). Deaf-advocacy at Queens Borough PL. American Libraries, 26(6), 560\u2013562.</ref>\n\n===Deaf services===\nThe library at [[Gallaudet University]], the only Deaf liberal arts university in the United States, was founded in 1876. The library's collection has grown from a small number of reference books to the world's largest collection of deaf-related materials with over 234,000 books and thousands of other materials in different formats. The library created a hybrid classification system based on an extension of the [[Dewey decimal system]] because traditional Dewey was not fine-grained enough to handle thousands of books in relatively small classification areas such as [[audiology]] or Deaf communication.<ref name=\"Harrington-1998\" />{{rp|9}} The library also houses the university's archives, which holds some of the oldest deaf-related books and documents in the world.<ref name=\"Harrington-1998\">Harrington, T.R.

The program was created in 1979 in response to information accessibility issues for the Deaf in the Nashville area. Originally, the only service provided was the news via a teletypewriter or TTY, but today, the program has expanded to serving the entire state of Tennessee by providing all different types of information and material on deafness, Deaf culture, and information for family members of Deaf people, as well as a historical and reference collection.<ref>Cohen, S.

The congress was attended by representatives from 25 countries.\n\nDr. [[Cesare Magarotto]] was one of the founders of World Federation of the Deaf and its first General Secretary (1951-1987) along with Mr. Vittorio Ieralla who was elected as the President from 1951-1955.\n\nMr. Ieralla and Dr. Magarotto successfully convinced the Italian government to support their efforts to establish a WFD General Secretariat in Rome, in 1951. With continued support from the Italian government and later with the ENS, the WFD General Secretariat was able to establish informative and advocacy networks, with national federations of the Deaf around the world.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://wfdeaf.org/who-we-are/our-story/|publisher=World Federation of the Deaf|title=Our Story|accessdate=7 January 2019}}</ref> Decades later, the WFD General Secretariat relocated to Finland (1987), with support from the Finnish government and the Finnish national of the Deaf led by the former WFD General Secretary Dr. Liisa Kauppinen (WFD President Emeritius).\n\n==Status==\nWFD has B-category status with the United Nations and is represented on the following groups':<ref name=mission />\n\n*[[United Nations Economic and Social Council|Economic and Social Council]] (ECOSOC)\n*Regional Commissions\n*[[Economic Commission for Africa]] (ECA)\n*[[Economic Commission for Europe]] (ECE)\n*[[United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean|Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean]] (ECLAC)\n*[[United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific|Economic Commission and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific]] (ESCAP)\n*[[United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Western Asia|Economic and Social Commission for Western Asia]] (ESCWA)\n*Panel of Experts on the UN Standard Rules for the Equalization of  Opportunities for Persons with Disabilities\n*[[Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights]] (OHCHR)\n*[[United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization]] (UNESCO)\n*[[International Labour Organization]] (ILO)  \n*[[World Health Organization]] (WHO)\n*[[World Bank]]\n*[[Council of Europe]]\n\nWFD provides expert advice on Deaf issues in its relationship with other international organizations and professional groups.\n\nThe legal seat of WFD is in Helsinki, Finland.<ref name=faq>{{cite web|title=FAQ|url=http://wfdeaf.org/faq|publisher=World Federation of the Deaf|accessdate=17 August 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131207224240/http://wfdeaf.org/faq|archivedate=7 December 2013|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n==Aims and objectives==\nAt present, emphasis is placed on the following areas:<ref name=mission>{{cite web|title=Our philosophy|url=http://wfdeaf.org/who-we-are/our-philosophy/|work=World Federation of the Deaf|accessdate=7 January 2019}}</ref>\n\n#Improve the status of national sign languages,<ref name=mission/><ref name=fact>{{cite web|title=Fact Sheet|url=http://wfdeaf.org/databank/fact-sheet|publisher=World Federation of the Deaf|accessdate=17 August 2013|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131207225356/http://wfdeaf.org/databank/fact-sheet|archivedate=7 December 2013}}</ref>\n#Better education for Deaf people,<ref name=childed>{{cite web|title=Education rights for Deaf children|url=http://wfdeaf.org/our-work/human-rights-of-the-deaf/|publisher=World Federation of the Deaf|accessdate=7 January 2019}}</ref>\n#Improve access to information and services<ref name=mission/>\n#Improve human rights for Deaf people in developing countries<ref name=mission/><ref name=childed/><ref>{{cite web|title=Work Done by Member Organisations in Developing Countries|url=https://wfdeaf.org/news/resources/policy-work-done-by-member-organisations-in-developing-countries/|publisher=World Federation of the Deaf|accessdate=7 January 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=WFD Work in Developing Countries|url=https://wfdeaf.org/news/resources/wfd-work-in-developing-countries-2/|publisher=World Federation of the Deaf|accessdate=7 January 2019}}</ref>\n#Promote the establishment of Deaf organisations where none currently exist<ref name=mission/>\n\n==Constituency==\nThe WFD claims to represent 70 million deaf people worldwide, of which more than 80 percent live in [[developing countries]].

Clothing is typically made of fabrics or [[textile]]s but over time has included garments made from [[animal skin]] or other thin sheets of materials put together. The wearing of clothing is mostly restricted to [[human being]]s and is a feature of all human [[societies]]. The amount and type of clothing worn depends on gender, body type, social, and geographic considerations.\n\nClothing serves many purposes: it can serve as protection from the [[weather|elements]], rough surfaces, rash-causing plants, [[Insect bites and stings|insect bites]], [[splinter]]s, [[Thorns, spines, and prickles|thorns and prickles]] by providing a barrier between the skin and the environment. Clothes can insulate against cold or hot conditions, and they can provide a [[hygienic]] barrier, keeping infectious and toxic materials away from the body. Clothing also provides protection from [[Ultraviolet|ultraviolet radiation]].\n\nWearing clothes is also a [[Dress code|social norm]], and being deprived of clothing in front of others may be [[Embarrassment|embarrassing]]. In most parts of the world, not wearing clothes in public so that [[Sex organ#Mammals|genitals]], [[breast]]s or [[buttocks]] are visible could be considered [[indecent exposure]].\n\n== Origin of clothing ==\n{{see also|Evolution of hair|History of clothing and textiles}}\nThere is no easy way to determine when clothing was first developed. Estimates by various experts have ranged from 40,000 to 3 million years ago. Some more recent studies involving the evolution of body lice have implied a more recent development with some indicating a development of around 170,000 years ago and others indicating as little as 40,000. No single estimate is widely accepted.<ref>{{Citation|author=Ralf Kittler, Manfred Kayser & Mark Stoneking |journal=[[Current Biology]] |volume=13 |pages=1414\u20131417 |year=2003 |title=Molecular evolution of ''Pediculus humanus'' and the origin of clothing |url=http://www.eva.mpg.de/genetics/pdf/Kittler.CurBiol.2003.pdf |doi=10.1016/S0960-9822(03)00507-4 |pmid=12932325 |issue=16 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080910120019/http://www.eva.mpg.de/genetics/pdf/Kittler.CurBiol.2003.pdf |archivedate=2008-09-10 }}</ref><ref name=\"Stoneking\">{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.cub.2004.12.024|title=Molecular Evolution of Pediculus humanus and the Origin of Clothing|journal=Current Biology|volume=14|issue=24|page=2309|year=2004|last1=Kittler|first1=Ralf|last2=Kayser|first2=Manfred|last3=Stoneking|first3=Mark|doi-access=free}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Toups |first1=Melissa A. |display-authors=et al |title=Origin of Clothing Lice Indicates Early Clothing Use by Anatomically Modern Humans in Africa |journal=Molecular Biology and Evolution |doi=10.1093/molbev/msq234 |pmid=20823373 |pmc=3002236 |volume=28 |issue=1 |date=January 2011 |pages=29\u201332}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal\n|last=Reed\n|first=David\n|display-authors=et al.\n|title=Pair of lice lost or parasites regained: The evolutionary history of Anthropoid primate lice\n|journal=BMC Biology\n|year=2007\n|doi=10.1186/1741-7007-5-7\n|pmid=17343749\n|volume=5 |issue=7\n|pages=7\n|pmc=1828715\n}}</ref>\n\n==Functions==\n[[File:Well-clothed baby.jpg|thumb|upright=.85|A [[Infant|baby]] wearing many items of [[winter]] clothing: [[headband]], [[cap]], fur-lined [[Coat (clothing)|coat]], [[scarf]] and [[sweater]].]]\n{{multiple image|perrow = 2|total_width=200\n| image1 = Black Boater Hat, Floral Print Dress, and Bronze Sandals (17250719875) (cropped).jpg\n| image2 = Polka Dot Sleeveless Top, Maroon H&M Skater Skirt, Cutout Ankle Boots, and a Black Lace Purse (22061303870).jpg\n| image3 = Strapless Polka Dot Peplum Romper, White Sandals, and a Tan Straw Hat (19335873624).jpg\n| image4 = Green Scalloped Shorts, Baby Blue Top, and White Sandals (17396821965) (cropped).jpg\n| footer = Four types of women's clothing which end above the knees: (clockwise from top) [[minidress]], [[miniskirt]], [[shorts]] and [[romper]], all worn by the same model.\n}}\nThe most obvious function of clothing is to protect the wearer from the elements. In hot weather, clothing provides protection from [[sunburn]] or [[wind]] damage. In the cold it offers [[thermal insulation]]. Shelter can reduce the functional need for clothing. For example, [[Coat (clothing)|coats]], [[hat]]s, [[glove]]s and other outer layers are normally removed when entering a warm place. Similarly, clothing has seasonal and regional aspects, so that thinner materials and fewer layers of clothing are generally worn in warmer regions and seasons than in colder ones.\n\nClothing performs a range of social and [[culture|cultural]] functions, such as individual, occupational and gender differentiation, and social status.<ref name=\"Flugel1930\">{{citation |date=1976|origyear= 1930 |author=Flugel, John Carl |title=The Psychology of Clothes |series=International Psycho-analytical Library |volume=No.18 |publisher=New York: AMS Press. First published by Hogarth Press, London | isbn = 0-404-14721-6 }} Alternative {{ISBN|978-0-404-14721-1}} (This work is one of the earliest attempts at an overview of the psycho-social and practical functions of clothing)</ref> In many societies, norms about clothing reflect standards of [[modesty]], [[religion]], [[gender]], and [[social status]]. Clothing may also function as adornment and an expression of personal taste or style.\n\nClothing has been made from a very wide variety of materials, ranging from leather and [[fur]]s to woven fabrics to elaborate and exotic natural and [[Synthetic fiber|synthetic fabrics]]. Not all body coverings are regarded as clothing. Articles carried rather than worn (such as [[Handbag|purses]]), worn on a single part of the body and easily removed ([[scarves]]), worn purely for adornment ([[jewelry]]), or those that serve a function other than protection ([[eyeglasses]]), are normally considered [[fashion accessory|accessories]] rather than clothing.\n\nClothing protects against many things that might injure or irritate the uncovered human body, including rain, snow, wind, and other weather, as well as from the sun. Garments that are too sheer, thin, small or tight offer less protection. Appropriate clothes can also reduce risk during activities such as work or sport. Some clothing protects from specific hazards, such as [[insect]]s, noxious chemicals, weather, [[weapons]], and contact with abrasive substances.\n\nHumans have devised clothing solutions to environmental or other hazards: such as [[space suits]], [[air conditioned clothing]], [[armor]], [[diving suits]], [[swimsuits]], [[Beekeeping#Protective clothing|bee-keeper gear]], [[motorcycle leathers]], [[high-visibility clothing]], and other pieces of [[protective clothing]]. The distinction between clothing and protective equipment is not always clear-cut, since clothes designed to be fashionable often have protective value and clothes designed for function often consider [[fashion]] in their design. The choice of clothes also has social implications. They cover parts of the body that social norms require to be covered, act as a form of adornment, and serve other social purposes. Someone who lacks the means to procure reasonable clothing due to poverty or affordability, or simply lack of inclination, is sometimes said to be scruffy, ragged, or shabby.<ref>Baradel, Lacey. \"Geographic Mobility and Domesticity in Eastman Johnson\u2019s The Tramp.\" American Art 28.2 (2014): 26\u201349</ref>\n\n==Scholarship==\nSerious books on clothing and its functions appear from the 19th century as imperialists dealt with new environments such as India and the tropics.<ref name=\"Jeffreys1858\">e.g. {{citation |year=1858 |author=Jeffreys, Julius |title=The British Army in India: Its Preservation by an appropriate Clothing, Housing, Locating, Recreative Employment, and Hopeful Encouragement of the Troops |place=London |publisher=Longman, Brown, Green, Longmans & Roberts |url=https://archive.org/stream/britisharmyinin01jeffgoog#page/n7/mode/1up |accessdate=8 September 2010}}</ref> Some scientific research into the multiple functions of clothing  in the first half of the 20th century, with publications such as [[J.C.

The man is in [[Suit (clothing)|suit]] and the woman is wearing a [[gown]].\n</gallery>\n\nIn most cultures, gender differentiation of clothing is considered appropriate. The differences are in styles, colors, fabrics, and types.\n\nIn Western societies, [[skirt]]s, [[Dress (garment)|dresses]], and [[high-heeled shoe]]s are usually seen as women's clothing, while [[necktie]]s are usually seen as men's clothing. [[Trousers]] were once seen as exclusively men's clothing, but can nowadays be worn by both genders. Men's clothes are often more practical (that is, they can function well under a wide variety of situations), but a wider range of clothing styles are available for women. Men are typically allowed to [[bare chested|bare their chests]] in a greater variety of public places. It is generally common for a woman to wear clothing perceived as masculine, while the opposite is seen as unusual.\n\nIn some cultures, [[sumptuary law]]s regulate what men and women are required to wear. [[Islam]] requires women to wear more modest forms of attire, usually [[hijab]]. What qualifies as \"modest\" varies in different Muslim societies; however, women are usually required to cover more of their bodies than men. Articles of clothing Muslim women wear for modesty range from the [[headscarf|head-scarf]] to the [[burqa]].\n\nMen may sometimes choose to wear [[men's skirts]] such as [[togas]] or [[kilt]]s in particular cultures, especially on ceremonial occasions. Such garments were (in previous times) often worn as normal daily clothing by men.\n\nClothing designed to be worn by either sex is called [[unisex clothing]]. Unisex clothes, such as T-shirts, tend to be cut straighter to fit a wider variety of bodies. The majority of unisex clothing styles have started out as menswear, but some articles, like the [[fedora]], were originally worn by women.\n\n===Social status===\n<gallery widths=\"200px\" heights=\"200px\">\nRajput Sherwani 2014-04-23 04-27.JPG|''[[Achkan]]'' [[sherwani]] and ''[[churidar]]'' (lower body) worn by [[Arvind Singh Mewar]] and his kin during a [[Hindu wedding]] in [[Rajasthan, India]].

In [[ancient Rome]], for example, only senators could wear garments dyed with [[Tyrian purple]]. In traditional [[Native Hawaiians|Hawaiian]] society, only high-ranking chiefs could wear [[feather cloak]]s and palaoa, or carved [[whale]] teeth. In China, before establishment of the [[Republic of China|republic]], only the emperor could wear [[yellow]]. History provides many examples of elaborate [[sumptuary law]]s that regulated what people could wear. In societies without such laws, which includes most modern societies, social status is instead signaled by the purchase of rare or luxury items that are limited by cost to those with wealth or status. In addition, [[peer pressure]] influences clothing choice.\n\n===Religion===\n{{See also|Category:Religious clothing}}\n<gallery widths=\"200px\" heights=\"200px\">\nGandhara Buddha (tnm).jpeg|The [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]] wearing [[Kasaya (clothing)|k\u0101\u1e63\u0101ya]] robes.

Sometimes it is worn only during the performance of religious ceremonies. However, it may also be worn every day as a marker for special religious status.\n\nFor example, [[Jain]]s and Muslim men wear unstitched [[cloth]] pieces when performing religious ceremonies. The unstitched cloth signifies unified and complete devotion to the task at hand, with no digression.{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}} Sikhs wear a turban as it is a part of their religion.\n\nThe cleanliness of religious dresses in some religions such as [[Hinduism]], [[Sikhism]], [[Buddhism]], [[Islam]] and [[Jainism]] is of paramount importance since it indicates purity.\n\nClothing appears in numerous contexts in the [[Bible]]; the most prominent passages are: the story of [[Adam and Eve]] who made coverings for themselves out of [[fig leaf|fig leaves]], [[Joseph (son of Jacob)|Joseph]]'s [[Coat of many colors|cloak]], [[Judah (Bible)|Judah]] and [[Tamar (Genesis)|Tamar]], [[Mordecai]] and [[Esther]]. Furthermore, the priests officiating in the Temple in Jerusalem had very specific garments, the lack of which made one liable to death.\n\nThe Quran says about husbands and wives, regarding clothing: \"...They are clothing/covering (Libaas) for you; and you for them\" (chapter 2:187).\n\nJewish ritual also requires rending of one's upper garment as a sign of mourning. {{Explain|date=February 2019}}\n\n[[Clergy#Christianity|Christian clergy]] members wear religious [[vestments]] during [[liturgy|liturgical]] services and may wear specific [[clerical clothing|non-liturgical clothing]] at other times.\n\n==Origin and history==\n{{Main|History of clothing and textiles}}\n{{See also|History of Western fashion|Category:History of clothing}}\n\n===Early use===\nAccording to archaeologists and anthropologists, the earliest clothing likely consisted of [[fur]], [[leather]], leaves, or grass that were draped, wrapped, or tied around the body. Knowledge of such clothing remains inferential, since clothing materials deteriorate quickly compared to stone, bone, shell and metal artifacts. Archeologists have identified very early [[sewing needle]]s of bone and ivory from about 30,000 BC, found near [[Kostenki]], [[Russia]] in 1988.<ref>Hoffecker, J., Scott, J., ''Excavations In Eastern Europe Reveal Ancient Human Lifestyles'', University of Colorado at Boulder News Archive, March 21, 2002, [http://www.colorado.edu/news/r/b278a670675fd8d2ca0700cdc0e9d808.html colorado.edu] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719175257/http://www.colorado.edu/news/r/b278a670675fd8d2ca0700cdc0e9d808.html |date=2011-07-19 }}</ref> Dyed [[flax]] fibers that could have been used in clothing have been found in a prehistoric cave in the [[Georgia (country)|Republic of Georgia]] that date back to 34,000 BC.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Balter M | year = 2009 | title = Clothes Make the (Hu) Man | url = | journal = Science | volume = 325 | issue = 5946| page = 1329 | doi = 10.1126/science.325_1329a | pmid = 19745126 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Kvavadze E, Bar-Yosef O, Belfer-Cohen A, Boaretto E, Jakeli N, Matskevich Z, Meshveliani T| year = 2009 | title = 30,000-Year-Old Wild Flax Fibers | url = http://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:HUL.InstRepos:4270521| journal = Science | volume = 325 | issue = 5946| page = 1359 | doi = 10.1126/science.1175404 | pmid = 19745144 }} [http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/data/325/5946/1359/DC1/1 Supporting Online Material]</ref>\n\nScientists are still debating when people started wearing clothes. Ralf Kittler, Manfred Kayser and Mark Stoneking, [[anthropology|anthropologists]] at the [[Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology]], have conducted a genetic analysis of human [[body lice]] that suggests clothing originated around 170,000 years ago. Body lice are an indicator of clothes-wearing, since most humans have sparse body hair, and lice thus require human clothing to survive. Their research suggests that the invention of clothing may have coincided with the northward migration of modern ''[[Homo sapiens]]'' away from the warm [[climate]] of [[Africa]], thought to have begun between 50,000 and 100,000 years ago. However, a second group of researchers using similar genetic methods estimate that clothing originated around 540,000 years ago.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Reed |display-authors=et al | year = 2004 | title =  Genetic Analysis of Lice Supports Direct Contact between Modern and Archaic Humans| journal = PLoS Biology | volume = 2 | issue = 11| page = e340 | doi=10.1371/journal.pbio.0020340 | pmid=15502871 | pmc=521174}}</ref> For now, the date of the origin of clothing remains unresolved.\n\n===Making clothing===\n{{See also|Garment industry||knitting|weaving}}\n[[File:Raja Ravi Varma, Lady Going for Pooja.jpg|alt=Sari|thumb|[[Hindu]] Indian lady wearing [[sari]], painting by [[Raja Ravi Varma]]. One of the most ancient and popular pieces of clothing in the [[Indian subcontinent]].]]\nSome human cultures, such as the various peoples of the [[Arctic Circle]], traditionally make their clothing entirely of prepared and decorated furs and skins. Other cultures supplemented or replaced leather and skins with cloth: woven, knitted, or twined from various animal and vegetable fibers including wool, [[linen]], [[cotton]], [[silk]], hemp, and [[ramie]].\n\nAlthough modern consumers may take the production of clothing for granted, making fabric by hand is a tedious and labor-intensive process involving fiber making, spinning, and weaving. The [[textile]] industry was the first to be mechanized&nbsp;\u2013 with the [[power loom|powered loom]]&nbsp;\u2013 during the [[Industrial Revolution]].\n\nDifferent cultures have evolved various ways of creating clothes out of cloth. One approach simply involves draping the cloth. Many people wore, and still wear, garments consisting of rectangles of cloth wrapped to fit&nbsp;\u2013 for example, the [[dhoti]] for men and the [[sari]] for women in the [[Indian subcontinent]], the Scottish [[kilt]] and the [[Java (island)|Javanese]] [[sarong]]. The clothes may simply be tied up (dhoti and sari); or pins or belts hold the garments in place (kilt and sarong). The cloth remains uncut, and people of various [[Clothing sizes|sizes]] can wear the garment.\n\nAnother approach involves measuring, cutting, and sewing the cloth by hand or with a [[sewing machine]]. Clothing can be cut from a [[sewing pattern]] and adjusted by a tailor to the wearer's measurements. An adjustable sewing mannequin or [[dress form]] is used to create form-fitting clothing. If the fabric is expensive, the tailor tries to use every bit of the cloth rectangle in constructing the clothing; perhaps cutting triangular pieces from one corner of the cloth, and adding them elsewhere as [[gusset]]s. Traditional European patterns for men's [[shirt]]s and women's [[chemise]]s take this approach. These remnants can also be reused to make patchwork hats, vests, and skirts.\n\nModern European [[fashion]] treats cloth much less conservatively, typically cutting in such a way as to leave various odd-shaped cloth remnants. Industrial sewing operations sell these as waste; home sewers may turn them into [[quilt]]s.\n\nIn the thousands of years that humans have been making clothing, they have created an astonishing array of styles, many of which have been reconstructed from surviving garments, [[photo]]s, [[painting]]s, [[mosaic]]s, etc., as well as from written descriptions. Costume history can inspire current [[fashion designer]]s, as well as costumiers for [[Play (theatre)|plays]], [[film]]s, [[television]], and [[historical reenactment]].\n\n==Contemporary clothing==\n{{POV section|date=July 2017}}\n{{Western dress codes}}\n\n=== Western dress code ===\n{{main|Western dress code}}\nThe Western dress code has changed over the past 500+ years.  The mechanization of the [[textile industry]] made many varieties of cloth widely available at affordable prices.  Styles have changed, and the availability of [[synthetic fabric]]s has changed the definition of \"stylish\".  In the latter half of the 20th century, [[jeans|blue jeans]] became very popular, and are now worn to events that normally demand formal attire.  [[Activewear]] has also become a large and growing market.\n\nJeans in the Western dress code are worn by both men and women. There are several unique styles of jeans found which include: high rise jeans, mid rise jeans, low rise jeans, bootcut jeans, straight jeans, cropped jeans, skinny jeans, cuffed jeans, boyfriend jeans, and capri jeans.\n\nThe licensing of designer names was pioneered by designers like [[Pierre Cardin]] in the 1960s and has been a common practice within the [[fashion industry]] from about the 1970s. Among the more popular include [[Marc Jacobs]] and [[Gucci]], named for Marc Jacobs and Guccio Gucci respectively.\n\n=== Spread of western styles ===\n[[File:Move In Day 2011 (6099706937) (cropped).jpg|thumb|University students in [[casual clothes]] in the US.]]\n\nBy the early years of the 21st century, western clothing styles had, to some extent, become international styles. This process began hundreds of years earlier, during the periods of European [[colonialism]]. The process of cultural dissemination has perpetuated over the centuries as Western media corporations have penetrated markets throughout the world, spreading Western culture and styles. [[Fast fashion]] clothing has also become a global phenomenon. These garments are less expensive, mass-produced Western clothing. Donated [[used good|used]] clothing from Western countries are also delivered to people in poor countries by charity organizations.\n\n=== Ethnic and cultural heritage ===\nPeople may wear ethnic or [[national costume|national dress]] on special occasions or in certain roles or occupations. For example, most Korean men and women have adopted Western-style dress for daily wear, but still wear traditional [[hanbok]]s on special occasions, like weddings and cultural holidays. Items of Western dress may also appear worn or accessorized in distinctive, non-Western ways. A Tongan man may combine a used [[T-shirt]] with a Tongan wrapped skirt, or [[tupenu]].\n\n===Sport and activity===\n{{Main|Activewear|Sportswear (fashion)}}\n\nMost sports and physical activities are practiced wearing special clothing, for practical, comfort or safety reasons. Common [[sportswear (activewear)|sportswear]] garments include [[shorts]], [[T-shirt]]s, [[tennis shirt]]s, [[leotard]]s, [[tracksuit]]s, and [[athletic shoe|trainers]]. Specialized garments include [[wet suit]]s (for [[human swimming|swimming]], [[Underwater diving|diving]] or [[surfing]]), [[salopettes]] (for [[skiing]]) and [[leotards]] (for [[gymnastics]]). Also, [[spandex]] materials are often used as base layers to soak up sweat. Spandex is also preferable for active sports that require form fitting garments, such as volleyball, wrestling, [[track & field]], dance, gymnastics and swimming.\n[[File:E1275480 (4315537281).jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|[[Fashion show]]s are often the source of the latest trends in clothing [[fashion]]s.

Women wore dresses all day, everyday. Day dresses had a drop waist, which was a sash or belt around the low waist or hip and a skirt that hung anywhere from the ankle on up to the knee, never above. Daywear had sleeves (long to mid-bicep) and a skirt that was straight, pleaded, hank hem, or tired.  Jewelry was less conspicuous.<ref>Simon Bliss, \"'L\u2019intelligence de la parure': Notes on Jewelry Wearing in the 1920s.\" ''Fashion Theory'' 20.1 (2016): 5\u201326.</ref>  Hair was often bobbed, giving a boyish look.<ref>Steven Zdatny,  \"The Boyish Look and the Liberated Woman: The Politics and Aesthetics of Women's Hairstyles.\" ''Fashion Theory'' 1.4 (1997): 367\u2013397.</ref>\n\nIn the 21st century a diverse range of styles exist in fashion, varying by geography, exposure to modern media, economic conditions, and ranging from expensive [[haute couture]] to traditional garb, to [[thrift store]] [[grunge]].  [[Fashion show]]s are events for designers to show off new and often extravagant designs.\n\n==Political issues==\n\n===Working conditions in the garments industry===\n{{further|Garment industry}}\n[[File:Garments Factory in Bangladesh.JPG|thumb|Garments factory in [[Bangladesh]].]]\n[[File:Safety garb for women workers.

[[Mass-produced]] clothing is often made in what are considered by some to be [[sweatshops]], typified by long work hours, lack of benefits, and lack of worker representation. While most examples of such conditions are found in [[developing countries]], clothes made in [[industrialized nation]]s may also be manufactured similarly.{{citation needed|date=March 2010}}\n\nCoalitions of [[NGO]]s, designers (including Katharine Hamnett, [[American Apparel]], [[Veja Sneakers|Veja]], [[Quiksilver]], eVocal, and Edun) and campaign groups like the [[Clean Clothes Campaign]] (CCC) and the [[Institute for Global Labour and Human Rights]] as well as [[textile and clothing trade unions]] have sought to improve these conditions as much as possible by sponsoring awareness-raising events, which draw the attention of both the media and the general public to the workers.\n\n[[Outsourcing]] production to low wage countries like [[Bangladesh]], [[China]], [[India]], [[Indonesia]], [[Pakistan]] and [[Sri Lanka]] became possible when the [[Multi Fibre Agreement]] (MFA) was abolished. The MFA, which placed quotas on textiles imports, was deemed a [[protectionist]] measure.{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}} Although many countries recognize treaties like the [[International Labour Organization]], which attempt to set standards for worker safety and rights, many countries have made exceptions to certain parts of the treaties or failed to thoroughly enforce them. India for example has not ratified sections 87 and 92 of the treaty.{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}}\n\nDespite the strong reactions that \"sweatshops\" evoked among [[Anti-globalization movement|critics of globalization]]{{which|date=March 2020}}, the [[textile industry|production of textiles]] has functioned as a consistent industry for developing nations, providing work and wages, whether construed as exploitative or not, to millions of people.<ref>European Parliamentary Research Service. \u201cWorkers' Conditions in the Textile and Clothing Sector: Just an Asian Affair?\u201d ''European Parliment'', Aug. 2014.

It is currently associated in developed countries with expensive, designer clothing, although fur is still used by indigenous people in arctic zones and higher elevations for its warmth and protection. Once uncontroversial, it has recently been the focus of campaigns on the grounds that campaigners consider it cruel and unnecessary. [[PETA]], along with other [[animal rights]] and [[animal liberation movement|animal liberation]] groups have called attention to [[fur farming]] and other practices they consider cruel.\n\n==Life cycle==\n\n===Clothing maintenance===\nClothing suffers assault both from within and without. The human body sheds skin cells and body oils, and exudes sweat, urine, and feces. From the outside, sun damage, moisture, abrasion, and dirt assault garments. Fleas and lice can hide in seams. Worn clothing, if not cleaned and refurbished, itches, becomes outworn, and loses functionality (as when [[button (clothing)|buttons]] fall off, seams come undone, fabrics thin or tear, and [[zipper]]s fail).\n\nOften, people wear an item of clothing until it falls apart. Some materials present problems. Cleaning leather is difficult, and bark cloth (tapa) cannot be washed without dissolving it. Owners may patch tears and rips, and brush off surface dirt, but materials like these inevitably age.\n\nHowever, most clothing consists of cloth, and most cloth can be [[laundry|laundered]] and mended (patching, [[darning]], but compare [[felt]]).\n\n=== Laundry, ironing, storage ===\nHumans have developed many specialized methods for laundering, ranging from early methods of pounding clothes against rocks in running streams, to the latest in electronic [[washing machine]]s and [[dry cleaning]] (dissolving dirt in [[solvents]] other than water). Hot water washing (boiling), chemical cleaning and ironing are all traditional methods of [[Sterilization (microbiology)|sterilizing]] fabrics for [[hygiene]] purposes.\n\nMany kinds of clothing are designed to be [[Ironing|ironed]] before they are worn to remove wrinkles. Most modern formal and semi-formal clothing is in this category (for example, [[dress shirt]]s and [[suit (clothing)|suits]]). Ironed clothes are believed to look clean, fresh, and neat. Much contemporary casual clothing is made of knit materials that do not readily wrinkle, and do not require ironing. Some clothing is [[permanent press]], having been treated with a coating (such as [[polytetrafluoroethylene]]) that suppresses wrinkles and creates a smooth appearance without ironing.\n\nOnce clothes have been laundered and possibly ironed, they are usually hung on [[clothes hanger]]s or folded, to keep them fresh until they are worn. Clothes are folded to allow them to be stored compactly, to prevent creasing, to preserve creases or to present them in a more pleasing manner, for instance when they are put on sale in stores.\n\nCertain types of insects and larvae feed on clothing and textiles, such as the [[Black carpet beetle]] and [[Clothing Moth|Clothing moths]]. To deter such pests, clothes may be stored in cedar-lined closets<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bobvila.com/articles/cedar-closets/|title=Cedar Closets 101|date=2017-09-08|website=Bob Vila|language=en|access-date=2019-06-12}}</ref> or chests, or placed in drawers or containers with materials having pest repellent properties, such as [[Lavandula#Other uses|Lavender]] or [[mothball]]s. Airtight containers (such as sealed, heavy-duty plastic bags) may also deter insect pest damage to clothing materials.\n\n===Non-iron===\n{{main|Permanent press}}\nA resin used for making non-wrinkle shirts releases [[formaldehyde]], which could cause contact dermatitis for some people; no disclosure requirements exist, and in 2008 the U.S. [[Government Accountability Office]] tested formaldehyde in clothing and found that generally the highest levels were in non-wrinkle shirts and pants.<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/11/your-money/11wrinkle.html When Wrinkle-Free Clothing Also Means Formaldehyde Fumes]. ''New York Times''.</ref> In 1999, a study of the effect of washing on the formaldehyde levels found that after 6 months after washing, 7 of 27 shirts had levels in excess of 75 ppm, which is a safe limit for direct skin exposure.<ref>[http://sciencelinks.jp/j-east/article/200006/000020000600A0121887.php Changes of Free Formaldehyde Quantity in Non-iron Shirts by Washing and Storage] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722124023/http://sciencelinks.jp/j-east/article/200006/000020000600A0121887.php |date=2011-07-22 }}. ''Journal of Health Science''.</ref>\n\n===Mending===\n{{see also|Darning}}\nWhen the raw material&nbsp;\u2013 cloth&nbsp;\u2013 was worth more than labor, it made sense to expend labor in saving it. In past times, mending was an art. A meticulous [[tailor]] or [[seamstress]] could mend rips with thread raveled from [[hem]]s and seam edges so skillfully that the tear was practically invisible. Today clothing is considered a consumable item. Mass-manufactured clothing is less expensive than the labor required to repair it. Many people buy a new piece of clothing rather than spend time mending. The thrifty still replace [[zipper]]s and [[Button (clothing)|buttons]] and sew up ripped hems.\n\n===Recycling===\nUsed, unwearable clothing can be repurposed for [[quilt]]s, [[:wikt:rag|rags]], [[Carpet|rugs]], [[bandage]]s, and many other household uses. It can also be recycled into [[paper]]. In Western societies, used clothing is often thrown out or donated to charity (such as through a [[clothing bin]]). It is also sold to [[consignment shop]]s, dress agencies, [[flea market]]s, and in [[online auction]]s. Used clothing is also often collected on an industrial scale to be sorted and shipped for re-use in poorer countries.  Globally, used clothes are worth $4 billion<ref>{{cite news|last1=Minter|first1=Adam|title=No One Wants Your Used Clothes Anymore|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2018-01-15/no-one-wants-your-used-clothes-anymore|accessdate=17 January 2018|work=[[Bloomberg News#Bloomberg View|Bloomberg View]]|date=15 January 2018}}</ref> with the US as the leading exporter at $575 million.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Banigan|first1=Melissa|title=East Africa Doesn't Want Your Hand-Me-Downs|url=https://www.racked.com/2018/1/25/16923226/east-africa-used-clothing-ban|accessdate=26 January 2018|work=Racked|publisher=[[Vox Media#Racked|Vox Media]]|date=25 January 2018}}</ref>\n\nThere are many concerns about the life cycle of synthetics, which come primarily from petrochemicals.{{Weasel inline|date=September 2009}} Unlike natural fibers, their source is not renewable and they are not biodegradable.<ref>[http://sweatshirtstation.com/articles/the-textile-materials-eco-battle-between-natural-and-synthetic-fabrics/ The Textile Materials Eco Battle Between Natural and Synthetic Fabrics] \"Steven E.

Clothing is typically made of fabrics or [[textile]]s but over time has included garments made from [[animal skin]] or other thin sheets of materials put together. The wearing of clothing is mostly restricted to [[human being]]s and is a feature of all human [[societies]]. The amount and type of clothing worn depends on gender, body type, social, and geographic considerations.\n\nClothing serves many purposes: it can serve as protection from the [[weather|elements]], rough surfaces, rash-causing plants, [[Insect bites and stings|insect bites]], [[splinter]]s, [[Thorns, spines, and prickles|thorns and prickles]] by providing a barrier between the skin and the environment. Clothes can insulate against cold or hot conditions, and they can provide a [[hygienic]] barrier, keeping infectious and toxic materials away from the body. Clothing also provides protection from [[Ultraviolet|ultraviolet radiation]].\n\nWearing clothes is also a [[Dress code|social norm]], and being deprived of clothing in front of others may be [[Embarrassment|embarrassing]]. In most parts of the world, not wearing clothes in public so that [[Sex organ#Mammals|genitals]], [[breast]]s or [[buttocks]] are visible could be considered [[indecent exposure]].\n\n== Origin of clothing ==\n{{see also|Evolution of hair|History of clothing and textiles}}\nThere is no easy way to determine when clothing was first developed. Estimates by various experts have ranged from 40,000 to 3 million years ago. Some more recent studies involving the evolution of body lice have implied a more recent development with some indicating a development of around 170,000 years ago and others indicating as little as 40,000. No single estimate is widely accepted.<ref>{{Citation|author=Ralf Kittler, Manfred Kayser & Mark Stoneking |journal=[[Current Biology]] |volume=13 |pages=1414\u20131417 |year=2003 |title=Molecular evolution of ''Pediculus humanus'' and the origin of clothing |url=http://www.eva.mpg.de/genetics/pdf/Kittler.CurBiol.2003.pdf |doi=10.1016/S0960-9822(03)00507-4 |pmid=12932325 |issue=16 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080910120019/http://www.eva.mpg.de/genetics/pdf/Kittler.CurBiol.2003.pdf |archivedate=2008-09-10 }}</ref><ref name=\"Stoneking\">{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.cub.2004.12.024|title=Molecular Evolution of Pediculus humanus and the Origin of Clothing|journal=Current Biology|volume=14|issue=24|page=2309|year=2004|last1=Kittler|first1=Ralf|last2=Kayser|first2=Manfred|last3=Stoneking|first3=Mark|doi-access=free}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Toups |first1=Melissa A. |display-authors=et al |title=Origin of Clothing Lice Indicates Early Clothing Use by Anatomically Modern Humans in Africa |journal=Molecular Biology and Evolution |doi=10.1093/molbev/msq234 |pmid=20823373 |pmc=3002236 |volume=28 |issue=1 |date=January 2011 |pages=29\u201332}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal\n|last=Reed\n|first=David\n|display-authors=et al.\n|title=Pair of lice lost or parasites regained: The evolutionary history of Anthropoid primate lice\n|journal=BMC Biology\n|year=2007\n|doi=10.1186/1741-7007-5-7\n|pmid=17343749\n|volume=5 |issue=7\n|pages=7\n|pmc=1828715\n}}</ref>\n\n==Functions==\n[[File:Well-clothed baby.jpg|thumb|upright=.85|A [[Infant|baby]] wearing many items of [[winter]] clothing: [[headband]], [[cap]], fur-lined [[Coat (clothing)|coat]], [[scarf]] and [[sweater]].]]\n{{multiple image|perrow = 2|total_width=200\n| image1 = Black Boater Hat, Floral Print Dress, and Bronze Sandals (17250719875) (cropped).jpg\n| image2 = Polka Dot Sleeveless Top, Maroon H&M Skater Skirt, Cutout Ankle Boots, and a Black Lace Purse (22061303870).jpg\n| image3 = Strapless Polka Dot Peplum Romper, White Sandals, and a Tan Straw Hat (19335873624).jpg\n| image4 = Green Scalloped Shorts, Baby Blue Top, and White Sandals (17396821965) (cropped).jpg\n| footer = Four types of women's clothing which end above the knees: (clockwise from top) [[minidress]], [[miniskirt]], [[shorts]] and [[romper]], all worn by the same model.\n}}\nThe most obvious function of clothing is to protect the wearer from the elements. In hot weather, clothing provides protection from [[sunburn]] or [[wind]] damage. In the cold it offers [[thermal insulation]]. Shelter can reduce the functional need for clothing. For example, [[Coat (clothing)|coats]], [[hat]]s, [[glove]]s and other outer layers are normally removed when entering a warm place. Similarly, clothing has seasonal and regional aspects, so that thinner materials and fewer layers of clothing are generally worn in warmer regions and seasons than in colder ones.\n\nClothing performs a range of social and [[culture|cultural]] functions, such as individual, occupational and gender differentiation, and social status.<ref name=\"Flugel1930\">{{citation |date=1976|origyear= 1930 |author=Flugel, John Carl |title=The Psychology of Clothes |series=International Psycho-analytical Library |volume=No.18 |publisher=New York: AMS Press.

Clothing may also function as adornment and an expression of personal taste or style.\n\nClothing has been made from a very wide variety of materials, ranging from leather and [[fur]]s to woven fabrics to elaborate and exotic natural and [[Synthetic fiber|synthetic fabrics]]. Not all body coverings are regarded as clothing. Articles carried rather than worn (such as [[Handbag|purses]]), worn on a single part of the body and easily removed ([[scarves]]), worn purely for adornment ([[jewelry]]), or those that serve a function other than protection ([[eyeglasses]]), are normally considered [[fashion accessory|accessories]] rather than clothing.\n\nClothing protects against many things that might injure or irritate the uncovered human body, including rain, snow, wind, and other weather, as well as from the sun. Garments that are too sheer, thin, small or tight offer less protection. Appropriate clothes can also reduce risk during activities such as work or sport. Some clothing protects from specific hazards, such as [[insect]]s, noxious chemicals, weather, [[weapons]], and contact with abrasive substances.\n\nHumans have devised clothing solutions to environmental or other hazards: such as [[space suits]], [[air conditioned clothing]], [[armor]], [[diving suits]], [[swimsuits]], [[Beekeeping#Protective clothing|bee-keeper gear]], [[motorcycle leathers]], [[high-visibility clothing]], and other pieces of [[protective clothing]]. The distinction between clothing and protective equipment is not always clear-cut, since clothes designed to be fashionable often have protective value and clothes designed for function often consider [[fashion]] in their design. The choice of clothes also has social implications. They cover parts of the body that social norms require to be covered, act as a form of adornment, and serve other social purposes. Someone who lacks the means to procure reasonable clothing due to poverty or affordability, or simply lack of inclination, is sometimes said to be scruffy, ragged, or shabby.<ref>Baradel, Lacey. \"Geographic Mobility and Domesticity in Eastman Johnson\u2019s The Tramp.\" American Art 28.2 (2014): 26\u201349</ref>\n\n==Scholarship==\nSerious books on clothing and its functions appear from the 19th century as imperialists dealt with new environments such as India and the tropics.<ref name=\"Jeffreys1858\">e.g. {{citation |year=1858 |author=Jeffreys, Julius |title=The British Army in India: Its Preservation by an appropriate Clothing, Housing, Locating, Recreative Employment, and Hopeful Encouragement of the Troops |place=London |publisher=Longman, Brown, Green, Longmans & Roberts |url=https://archive.org/stream/britisharmyinin01jeffgoog#page/n7/mode/1up |accessdate=8 September 2010}}</ref> Some scientific research into the multiple functions of clothing  in the first half of the 20th century, with publications such as [[J.C.

The man is in [[Suit (clothing)|suit]] and the woman is wearing a [[gown]].\n</gallery>\n\nIn most cultures, gender differentiation of clothing is considered appropriate. The differences are in styles, colors, fabrics, and types.\n\nIn Western societies, [[skirt]]s, [[Dress (garment)|dresses]], and [[high-heeled shoe]]s are usually seen as women's clothing, while [[necktie]]s are usually seen as men's clothing. [[Trousers]] were once seen as exclusively men's clothing, but can nowadays be worn by both genders. Men's clothes are often more practical (that is, they can function well under a wide variety of situations), but a wider range of clothing styles are available for women. Men are typically allowed to [[bare chested|bare their chests]] in a greater variety of public places. It is generally common for a woman to wear clothing perceived as masculine, while the opposite is seen as unusual.\n\nIn some cultures, [[sumptuary law]]s regulate what men and women are required to wear. [[Islam]] requires women to wear more modest forms of attire, usually [[hijab]]. What qualifies as \"modest\" varies in different Muslim societies; however, women are usually required to cover more of their bodies than men. Articles of clothing Muslim women wear for modesty range from the [[headscarf|head-scarf]] to the [[burqa]].\n\nMen may sometimes choose to wear [[men's skirts]] such as [[togas]] or [[kilt]]s in particular cultures, especially on ceremonial occasions. Such garments were (in previous times) often worn as normal daily clothing by men.\n\nClothing designed to be worn by either sex is called [[unisex clothing]]. Unisex clothes, such as T-shirts, tend to be cut straighter to fit a wider variety of bodies. The majority of unisex clothing styles have started out as menswear, but some articles, like the [[fedora]], were originally worn by women.\n\n===Social status===\n<gallery widths=\"200px\" heights=\"200px\">\nRajput Sherwani 2014-04-23 04-27.JPG|''[[Achkan]]'' [[sherwani]] and ''[[churidar]]'' (lower body) worn by [[Arvind Singh Mewar]] and his kin during a [[Hindu wedding]] in [[Rajasthan, India]].

In [[ancient Rome]], for example, only senators could wear garments dyed with [[Tyrian purple]]. In traditional [[Native Hawaiians|Hawaiian]] society, only high-ranking chiefs could wear [[feather cloak]]s and palaoa, or carved [[whale]] teeth. In China, before establishment of the [[Republic of China|republic]], only the emperor could wear [[yellow]]. History provides many examples of elaborate [[sumptuary law]]s that regulated what people could wear. In societies without such laws, which includes most modern societies, social status is instead signaled by the purchase of rare or luxury items that are limited by cost to those with wealth or status. In addition, [[peer pressure]] influences clothing choice.\n\n===Religion===\n{{See also|Category:Religious clothing}}\n<gallery widths=\"200px\" heights=\"200px\">\nGandhara Buddha (tnm).jpeg|The [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]] wearing [[Kasaya (clothing)|k\u0101\u1e63\u0101ya]] robes.

Sometimes it is worn only during the performance of religious ceremonies. However, it may also be worn every day as a marker for special religious status.\n\nFor example, [[Jain]]s and Muslim men wear unstitched [[cloth]] pieces when performing religious ceremonies. The unstitched cloth signifies unified and complete devotion to the task at hand, with no digression.{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}} Sikhs wear a turban as it is a part of their religion.\n\nThe cleanliness of religious dresses in some religions such as [[Hinduism]], [[Sikhism]], [[Buddhism]], [[Islam]] and [[Jainism]] is of paramount importance since it indicates purity.\n\nClothing appears in numerous contexts in the [[Bible]]; the most prominent passages are: the story of [[Adam and Eve]] who made coverings for themselves out of [[fig leaf|fig leaves]], [[Joseph (son of Jacob)|Joseph]]'s [[Coat of many colors|cloak]], [[Judah (Bible)|Judah]] and [[Tamar (Genesis)|Tamar]], [[Mordecai]] and [[Esther]]. Furthermore, the priests officiating in the Temple in Jerusalem had very specific garments, the lack of which made one liable to death.\n\nThe Quran says about husbands and wives, regarding clothing: \"...They are clothing/covering (Libaas) for you; and you for them\" (chapter 2:187).\n\nJewish ritual also requires rending of one's upper garment as a sign of mourning. {{Explain|date=February 2019}}\n\n[[Clergy#Christianity|Christian clergy]] members wear religious [[vestments]] during [[liturgy|liturgical]] services and may wear specific [[clerical clothing|non-liturgical clothing]] at other times.\n\n==Origin and history==\n{{Main|History of clothing and textiles}}\n{{See also|History of Western fashion|Category:History of clothing}}\n\n===Early use===\nAccording to archaeologists and anthropologists, the earliest clothing likely consisted of [[fur]], [[leather]], leaves, or grass that were draped, wrapped, or tied around the body. Knowledge of such clothing remains inferential, since clothing materials deteriorate quickly compared to stone, bone, shell and metal artifacts. Archeologists have identified very early [[sewing needle]]s of bone and ivory from about 30,000 BC, found near [[Kostenki]], [[Russia]] in 1988.<ref>Hoffecker, J., Scott, J., ''Excavations In Eastern Europe Reveal Ancient Human Lifestyles'', University of Colorado at Boulder News Archive, March 21, 2002, [http://www.colorado.edu/news/r/b278a670675fd8d2ca0700cdc0e9d808.html colorado.edu] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719175257/http://www.colorado.edu/news/r/b278a670675fd8d2ca0700cdc0e9d808.html |date=2011-07-19 }}</ref> Dyed [[flax]] fibers that could have been used in clothing have been found in a prehistoric cave in the [[Georgia (country)|Republic of Georgia]] that date back to 34,000 BC.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Balter M | year = 2009 | title = Clothes Make the (Hu) Man | url = | journal = Science | volume = 325 | issue = 5946| page = 1329 | doi = 10.1126/science.325_1329a | pmid = 19745126 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Kvavadze E, Bar-Yosef O, Belfer-Cohen A, Boaretto E, Jakeli N, Matskevich Z, Meshveliani T| year = 2009 | title = 30,000-Year-Old Wild Flax Fibers | url = http://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:HUL.InstRepos:4270521| journal = Science | volume = 325 | issue = 5946| page = 1359 | doi = 10.1126/science.1175404 | pmid = 19745144 }} [http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/data/325/5946/1359/DC1/1 Supporting Online Material]</ref>\n\nScientists are still debating when people started wearing clothes. Ralf Kittler, Manfred Kayser and Mark Stoneking, [[anthropology|anthropologists]] at the [[Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology]], have conducted a genetic analysis of human [[body lice]] that suggests clothing originated around 170,000 years ago. Body lice are an indicator of clothes-wearing, since most humans have sparse body hair, and lice thus require human clothing to survive. Their research suggests that the invention of clothing may have coincided with the northward migration of modern ''[[Homo sapiens]]'' away from the warm [[climate]] of [[Africa]], thought to have begun between 50,000 and 100,000 years ago. However, a second group of researchers using similar genetic methods estimate that clothing originated around 540,000 years ago.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Reed |display-authors=et al | year = 2004 | title =  Genetic Analysis of Lice Supports Direct Contact between Modern and Archaic Humans| journal = PLoS Biology | volume = 2 | issue = 11| page = e340 | doi=10.1371/journal.pbio.0020340 | pmid=15502871 | pmc=521174}}</ref> For now, the date of the origin of clothing remains unresolved.\n\n===Making clothing===\n{{See also|Garment industry||knitting|weaving}}\n[[File:Raja Ravi Varma, Lady Going for Pooja.jpg|alt=Sari|thumb|[[Hindu]] Indian lady wearing [[sari]], painting by [[Raja Ravi Varma]]. One of the most ancient and popular pieces of clothing in the [[Indian subcontinent]].]]\nSome human cultures, such as the various peoples of the [[Arctic Circle]], traditionally make their clothing entirely of prepared and decorated furs and skins. Other cultures supplemented or replaced leather and skins with cloth: woven, knitted, or twined from various animal and vegetable fibers including wool, [[linen]], [[cotton]], [[silk]], hemp, and [[ramie]].\n\nAlthough modern consumers may take the production of clothing for granted, making fabric by hand is a tedious and labor-intensive process involving fiber making, spinning, and weaving. The [[textile]] industry was the first to be mechanized&nbsp;\u2013 with the [[power loom|powered loom]]&nbsp;\u2013 during the [[Industrial Revolution]].\n\nDifferent cultures have evolved various ways of creating clothes out of cloth. One approach simply involves draping the cloth. Many people wore, and still wear, garments consisting of rectangles of cloth wrapped to fit&nbsp;\u2013 for example, the [[dhoti]] for men and the [[sari]] for women in the [[Indian subcontinent]], the Scottish [[kilt]] and the [[Java (island)|Javanese]] [[sarong]]. The clothes may simply be tied up (dhoti and sari); or pins or belts hold the garments in place (kilt and sarong). The cloth remains uncut, and people of various [[Clothing sizes|sizes]] can wear the garment.\n\nAnother approach involves measuring, cutting, and sewing the cloth by hand or with a [[sewing machine]]. Clothing can be cut from a [[sewing pattern]] and adjusted by a tailor to the wearer's measurements. An adjustable sewing mannequin or [[dress form]] is used to create form-fitting clothing. If the fabric is expensive, the tailor tries to use every bit of the cloth rectangle in constructing the clothing; perhaps cutting triangular pieces from one corner of the cloth, and adding them elsewhere as [[gusset]]s. Traditional European patterns for men's [[shirt]]s and women's [[chemise]]s take this approach. These remnants can also be reused to make patchwork hats, vests, and skirts.\n\nModern European [[fashion]] treats cloth much less conservatively, typically cutting in such a way as to leave various odd-shaped cloth remnants. Industrial sewing operations sell these as waste; home sewers may turn them into [[quilt]]s.\n\nIn the thousands of years that humans have been making clothing, they have created an astonishing array of styles, many of which have been reconstructed from surviving garments, [[photo]]s, [[painting]]s, [[mosaic]]s, etc., as well as from written descriptions. Costume history can inspire current [[fashion designer]]s, as well as costumiers for [[Play (theatre)|plays]], [[film]]s, [[television]], and [[historical reenactment]].\n\n==Contemporary clothing==\n{{POV section|date=July 2017}}\n{{Western dress codes}}\n\n=== Western dress code ===\n{{main|Western dress code}}\nThe Western dress code has changed over the past 500+ years.  The mechanization of the [[textile industry]] made many varieties of cloth widely available at affordable prices.  Styles have changed, and the availability of [[synthetic fabric]]s has changed the definition of \"stylish\".  In the latter half of the 20th century, [[jeans|blue jeans]] became very popular, and are now worn to events that normally demand formal attire.  [[Activewear]] has also become a large and growing market.\n\nJeans in the Western dress code are worn by both men and women. There are several unique styles of jeans found which include: high rise jeans, mid rise jeans, low rise jeans, bootcut jeans, straight jeans, cropped jeans, skinny jeans, cuffed jeans, boyfriend jeans, and capri jeans.\n\nThe licensing of designer names was pioneered by designers like [[Pierre Cardin]] in the 1960s and has been a common practice within the [[fashion industry]] from about the 1970s. Among the more popular include [[Marc Jacobs]] and [[Gucci]], named for Marc Jacobs and Guccio Gucci respectively.\n\n=== Spread of western styles ===\n[[File:Move In Day 2011 (6099706937) (cropped).jpg|thumb|University students in [[casual clothes]] in the US.]]\n\nBy the early years of the 21st century, western clothing styles had, to some extent, become international styles. This process began hundreds of years earlier, during the periods of European [[colonialism]]. The process of cultural dissemination has perpetuated over the centuries as Western media corporations have penetrated markets throughout the world, spreading Western culture and styles. [[Fast fashion]] clothing has also become a global phenomenon. These garments are less expensive, mass-produced Western clothing. Donated [[used good|used]] clothing from Western countries are also delivered to people in poor countries by charity organizations.\n\n=== Ethnic and cultural heritage ===\nPeople may wear ethnic or [[national costume|national dress]] on special occasions or in certain roles or occupations. For example, most Korean men and women have adopted Western-style dress for daily wear, but still wear traditional [[hanbok]]s on special occasions, like weddings and cultural holidays. Items of Western dress may also appear worn or accessorized in distinctive, non-Western ways. A Tongan man may combine a used [[T-shirt]] with a Tongan wrapped skirt, or [[tupenu]].\n\n===Sport and activity===\n{{Main|Activewear|Sportswear (fashion)}}\n\nMost sports and physical activities are practiced wearing special clothing, for practical, comfort or safety reasons. Common [[sportswear (activewear)|sportswear]] garments include [[shorts]], [[T-shirt]]s, [[tennis shirt]]s, [[leotard]]s, [[tracksuit]]s, and [[athletic shoe|trainers]]. Specialized garments include [[wet suit]]s (for [[human swimming|swimming]], [[Underwater diving|diving]] or [[surfing]]), [[salopettes]] (for [[skiing]]) and [[leotards]] (for [[gymnastics]]). Also, [[spandex]] materials are often used as base layers to soak up sweat. Spandex is also preferable for active sports that require form fitting garments, such as volleyball, wrestling, [[track & field]], dance, gymnastics and swimming.\n[[File:E1275480 (4315537281).jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|[[Fashion show]]s are often the source of the latest trends in clothing [[fashion]]s.

Daywear had sleeves (long to mid-bicep) and a skirt that was straight, pleaded, hank hem, or tired.  Jewelry was less conspicuous.<ref>Simon Bliss, \"'L\u2019intelligence de la parure': Notes on Jewelry Wearing in the 1920s.\" ''Fashion Theory'' 20.1 (2016): 5\u201326.</ref>  Hair was often bobbed, giving a boyish look.<ref>Steven Zdatny,  \"The Boyish Look and the Liberated Woman: The Politics and Aesthetics of Women's Hairstyles.\" ''Fashion Theory'' 1.4 (1997): 367\u2013397.</ref>\n\nIn the 21st century a diverse range of styles exist in fashion, varying by geography, exposure to modern media, economic conditions, and ranging from expensive [[haute couture]] to traditional garb, to [[thrift store]] [[grunge]].  [[Fashion show]]s are events for designers to show off new and often extravagant designs.\n\n==Political issues==\n\n===Working conditions in the garments industry===\n{{further|Garment industry}}\n[[File:Garments Factory in Bangladesh.JPG|thumb|Garments factory in [[Bangladesh]].]]\n[[File:Safety garb for women workers. The uniform at the left, complete with the plastic \"bra\" on the right, will prevent... - NARA - 522882.jpg|thumb|upright|Safety garb for women workers in [[Los Angeles]], c. 1943, was designed to prevent occupational accidents among female war workers.]]\n\nAlthough [[mechanization]] transformed most aspects of human industry by the mid-20th century, [[garment]] workers have continued to labor under challenging conditions that demand repetitive manual labor. [[Mass-produced]] clothing is often made in what are considered by some to be [[sweatshops]], typified by long work hours, lack of benefits, and lack of worker representation. While most examples of such conditions are found in [[developing countries]], clothes made in [[industrialized nation]]s may also be manufactured similarly.{{citation needed|date=March 2010}}\n\nCoalitions of [[NGO]]s, designers (including Katharine Hamnett, [[American Apparel]], [[Veja Sneakers|Veja]], [[Quiksilver]], eVocal, and Edun) and campaign groups like the [[Clean Clothes Campaign]] (CCC) and the [[Institute for Global Labour and Human Rights]] as well as [[textile and clothing trade unions]] have sought to improve these conditions as much as possible by sponsoring awareness-raising events, which draw the attention of both the media and the general public to the workers.\n\n[[Outsourcing]] production to low wage countries like [[Bangladesh]], [[China]], [[India]], [[Indonesia]], [[Pakistan]] and [[Sri Lanka]] became possible when the [[Multi Fibre Agreement]] (MFA) was abolished. The MFA, which placed quotas on textiles imports, was deemed a [[protectionist]] measure.{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}} Although many countries recognize treaties like the [[International Labour Organization]], which attempt to set standards for worker safety and rights, many countries have made exceptions to certain parts of the treaties or failed to thoroughly enforce them. India for example has not ratified sections 87 and 92 of the treaty.{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}}\n\nDespite the strong reactions that \"sweatshops\" evoked among [[Anti-globalization movement|critics of globalization]]{{which|date=March 2020}}, the [[textile industry|production of textiles]] has functioned as a consistent industry for developing nations, providing work and wages, whether construed as exploitative or not, to millions of people.<ref>European Parliamentary Research Service. \u201cWorkers' Conditions in the Textile and Clothing Sector: Just an Asian Affair?\u201d ''European Parliment'', Aug. 2014.

It is currently associated in developed countries with expensive, designer clothing, although fur is still used by indigenous people in arctic zones and higher elevations for its warmth and protection. Once uncontroversial, it has recently been the focus of campaigns on the grounds that campaigners consider it cruel and unnecessary. [[PETA]], along with other [[animal rights]] and [[animal liberation movement|animal liberation]] groups have called attention to [[fur farming]] and other practices they consider cruel.\n\n==Life cycle==\n\n===Clothing maintenance===\nClothing suffers assault both from within and without. The human body sheds skin cells and body oils, and exudes sweat, urine, and feces. From the outside, sun damage, moisture, abrasion, and dirt assault garments. Fleas and lice can hide in seams. Worn clothing, if not cleaned and refurbished, itches, becomes outworn, and loses functionality (as when [[button (clothing)|buttons]] fall off, seams come undone, fabrics thin or tear, and [[zipper]]s fail).\n\nOften, people wear an item of clothing until it falls apart. Some materials present problems. Cleaning leather is difficult, and bark cloth (tapa) cannot be washed without dissolving it. Owners may patch tears and rips, and brush off surface dirt, but materials like these inevitably age.\n\nHowever, most clothing consists of cloth, and most cloth can be [[laundry|laundered]] and mended (patching, [[darning]], but compare [[felt]]).\n\n=== Laundry, ironing, storage ===\nHumans have developed many specialized methods for laundering, ranging from early methods of pounding clothes against rocks in running streams, to the latest in electronic [[washing machine]]s and [[dry cleaning]] (dissolving dirt in [[solvents]] other than water). Hot water washing (boiling), chemical cleaning and ironing are all traditional methods of [[Sterilization (microbiology)|sterilizing]] fabrics for [[hygiene]] purposes.\n\nMany kinds of clothing are designed to be [[Ironing|ironed]] before they are worn to remove wrinkles. Most modern formal and semi-formal clothing is in this category (for example, [[dress shirt]]s and [[suit (clothing)|suits]]). Ironed clothes are believed to look clean, fresh, and neat. Much contemporary casual clothing is made of knit materials that do not readily wrinkle, and do not require ironing. Some clothing is [[permanent press]], having been treated with a coating (such as [[polytetrafluoroethylene]]) that suppresses wrinkles and creates a smooth appearance without ironing.\n\nOnce clothes have been laundered and possibly ironed, they are usually hung on [[clothes hanger]]s or folded, to keep them fresh until they are worn. Clothes are folded to allow them to be stored compactly, to prevent creasing, to preserve creases or to present them in a more pleasing manner, for instance when they are put on sale in stores.\n\nCertain types of insects and larvae feed on clothing and textiles, such as the [[Black carpet beetle]] and [[Clothing Moth|Clothing moths]]. To deter such pests, clothes may be stored in cedar-lined closets<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bobvila.com/articles/cedar-closets/|title=Cedar Closets 101|date=2017-09-08|website=Bob Vila|language=en|access-date=2019-06-12}}</ref> or chests, or placed in drawers or containers with materials having pest repellent properties, such as [[Lavandula#Other uses|Lavender]] or [[mothball]]s. Airtight containers (such as sealed, heavy-duty plastic bags) may also deter insect pest damage to clothing materials.\n\n===Non-iron===\n{{main|Permanent press}}\nA resin used for making non-wrinkle shirts releases [[formaldehyde]], which could cause contact dermatitis for some people; no disclosure requirements exist, and in 2008 the U.S. [[Government Accountability Office]] tested formaldehyde in clothing and found that generally the highest levels were in non-wrinkle shirts and pants.<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/11/your-money/11wrinkle.html When Wrinkle-Free Clothing Also Means Formaldehyde Fumes]. ''New York Times''.</ref> In 1999, a study of the effect of washing on the formaldehyde levels found that after 6 months after washing, 7 of 27 shirts had levels in excess of 75 ppm, which is a safe limit for direct skin exposure.<ref>[http://sciencelinks.jp/j-east/article/200006/000020000600A0121887.php Changes of Free Formaldehyde Quantity in Non-iron Shirts by Washing and Storage] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722124023/http://sciencelinks.jp/j-east/article/200006/000020000600A0121887.php |date=2011-07-22 }}. ''Journal of Health Science''.</ref>\n\n===Mending===\n{{see also|Darning}}\nWhen the raw material&nbsp;\u2013 cloth&nbsp;\u2013 was worth more than labor, it made sense to expend labor in saving it. In past times, mending was an art. A meticulous [[tailor]] or [[seamstress]] could mend rips with thread raveled from [[hem]]s and seam edges so skillfully that the tear was practically invisible. Today clothing is considered a consumable item. Mass-manufactured clothing is less expensive than the labor required to repair it. Many people buy a new piece of clothing rather than spend time mending. The thrifty still replace [[zipper]]s and [[Button (clothing)|buttons]] and sew up ripped hems.\n\n===Recycling===\nUsed, unwearable clothing can be repurposed for [[quilt]]s, [[:wikt:rag|rags]], [[Carpet|rugs]], [[bandage]]s, and many other household uses. It can also be recycled into [[paper]]. In Western societies, used clothing is often thrown out or donated to charity (such as through a [[clothing bin]]). It is also sold to [[consignment shop]]s, dress agencies, [[flea market]]s, and in [[online auction]]s. Used clothing is also often collected on an industrial scale to be sorted and shipped for re-use in poorer countries.  Globally, used clothes are worth $4 billion<ref>{{cite news|last1=Minter|first1=Adam|title=No One Wants Your Used Clothes Anymore|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2018-01-15/no-one-wants-your-used-clothes-anymore|accessdate=17 January 2018|work=[[Bloomberg News#Bloomberg View|Bloomberg View]]|date=15 January 2018}}</ref> with the US as the leading exporter at $575 million.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Banigan|first1=Melissa|title=East Africa Doesn't Want Your Hand-Me-Downs|url=https://www.racked.com/2018/1/25/16923226/east-africa-used-clothing-ban|accessdate=26 January 2018|work=Racked|publisher=[[Vox Media#Racked|Vox Media]]|date=25 January 2018}}</ref>\n\nThere are many concerns about the life cycle of synthetics, which come primarily from petrochemicals.{{Weasel inline|date=September 2009}} Unlike natural fibers, their source is not renewable and they are not biodegradable.<ref>[http://sweatshirtstation.com/articles/the-textile-materials-eco-battle-between-natural-and-synthetic-fabrics/ The Textile Materials Eco Battle Between Natural and Synthetic Fabrics] \"Steven E.

A '''wristwatch''' is designed to be worn around the [[wrist]], attached by a [[watch strap]] or other type of [[bracelet]], including [[metal bands]], [[leather straps]] or any other kind of bracelet. A [[pocket watch]] is designed for a person to carry in a [[pocket]], often attached to a chain. The study of timekeeping is known as [[horology]].\n\nWatches progressed in the 17th&nbsp;century from spring-powered clocks, which appeared as early as the 14th&nbsp;century. During most of its history the watch was a mechanical device, driven by [[clockwork]], powered by winding a [[mainspring]], and keeping time with an oscillating [[balance wheel]].

The first thing to be improved was the [[escapement]]. The verge escapement was replaced in quality watches by the [[Escapement#Cylinder escapement|cylinder escapement]], invented by [[Thomas Tompion]] in 1695 and further developed by [[George Graham (clockmaker)|George Graham]] in the 1720s. Improvements in manufacturing such as the tooth-cutting machine devised by [[Robert Hooke]] allowed some increase in the volume of watch production, although finishing and assembling was still done by hand until well into the 19th century.\n\nA major cause of error in balance wheel timepieces, caused by changes in [[Elasticity (physics)|elasticity]] of the [[balance spring]] from temperature changes, was solved by the bimetallic [[Balance wheel|temperature compensated balance wheel]] invented in 1765 by [[Pierre Le Roy]] and improved by [[Thomas Earnshaw]]. The [[lever escapement]] was the single most important technological breakthrough, and was invented by [[Thomas Mudge (horologist)|Thomas Mudge]] in 1759 and improved by Josiah Emery in 1785, although it only gradually came into use from about 1800 onwards, chiefly in Britain.\n[[File:Acta Eruditorum - II orologi, 1737 \u2013 BEIC 13458392.jpg|thumb|A watch drawn in [[Acta Eruditorum]], 1737]]\nThe British had predominated in watch manufacture for much of the 17th and 18th centuries, but maintained a system of production that was geared towards high-quality products for the elite.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cVUSauNST8EC&dq=British+Watch+Company+mass+production&source=gbs_navlinks_s|title=Manufacturing Time: Global Competition in the Watch Industry, 1795\u20132000|author=Glasmeier, Amy|year=2000|publisher=Guilford Press|accessdate=7 February 2013}}</ref> Although there was an attempt to modernise clock manufacture with [[mass production]] techniques and the application of duplicating tools and machinery by the British Watch Company in 1843, it was in the [[United States]] that this system took off.

[[Elizabeth I]] of England received a wristwatch from [[Robert Dudley, 1st Earl of Leicester|Robert Dudley]] in 1571, described as an armed watch. The oldest surviving wristwatch (then described as a bracelet watch) is one made in 1806 and given to [[Jos\u00e9phine de Beauharnais]].<ref name=Bruton183>{{cite book |last=Bruton |first=Eric |date=2000 |title=The History of Clocks & Watches |publisher=Little, Brown and Company |page=183 |isbn=0316853550}}</ref> From the beginning, wristwatches were almost exclusively worn by women, while men used pocket watches up until the early 20th century.<ref name=\"Evolu\">{{cite web|url=http://www.vintagewatchstraps.com/wristwatches.html|title=The Evolution of the Wristwatch|access-date=8 December 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131208200615/http://vintagewatchstraps.com/wristwatches.html|archive-date=8 December 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nWristwatches were first worn by military men towards the end of the 19th century, when the importance of synchronizing maneuvers during war, without potentially revealing the plan to the enemy through signaling, was increasingly recognized. The Garstin Company of [[London]] patented a \"Watch Wristlet\" design in 1893, but they were probably producing similar designs from the 1880s. Officers in the [[British Army]] began using wristwatches during colonial military campaigns in the 1880s, such as during the [[Third Anglo-Burmese War|Anglo-Burma War]] of 1885.<ref name=\"Evolu\" /> During the [[First Boer War]], the importance of coordinating troop movements and synchronizing attacks against the highly mobile Boer insurgents became paramount, and the use of wristwatches subsequently became widespread among the officer class. The company [[Mappin & Webb]] began production of their successful \"campaign watch\" for soldiers during the [[Battle of Omdurman|campaign at Sudan in 1898]] and accelerated production for the [[Second Boer War]] a few years later.<ref name=\"Evolu\" /> In continental Europe, [[Girard-Perregaux]] and other Swiss watchmakers began supplying German naval officers with wristwatches in about 1880.<ref name=Bruton183 />\n\nEarly models were essentially standard pocket-watches fitted to a leather strap but, by the early 20th century, manufacturers began producing purpose-built wristwatches. The Swiss company Dimier Fr\u00e8res & Cie patented a wristwatch design with the now standard wire lugs in 1903. [[Hans Wilsdorf]] moved to London in 1905 and set up his own business, Wilsdorf & Davis, with his brother-in-law Alfred Davis, providing quality timepieces at affordable prices; the company later became [[Rolex]].<ref>Rolex Jubilee Vade Mecum published by the Rolex Watch Company in 1946.</ref> Wilsdorf was an early convert to the wristwatch, and contracted the Swiss firm Aegler to produce a line of wristwatches.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.qualitytyme.net/pages/rolex_articles/history_of_wristwatch.html|title=The History and Evolution of the Wristwatch.|first=John E.|last=Brozek|publisher=International Watch Magazine}}</ref>\n\nThe impact of the [[First World War]] dramatically shifted public perceptions on the propriety of the man's wristwatch and opened up a mass market in the postwar era. The [[creeping barrage]] artillery tactic, developed during the war, required precise synchronization between the artillery gunners and the infantry advancing behind the barrage. Service watches produced during the War were specially designed for the rigours of [[trench warfare]], with luminous dials and unbreakable glass. The [[War Office]] began issuing wristwatches to combatants from 1917.<ref>{{cite book |last=Hoffman |first=Paul |year=2004 |title=Wings of Madness: Alberto Santos-Dumont and the Invention of Flight |publisher=Hyperion Press |isbn=0-7868-8571-8 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/wingsofmadnessal0000hoff }}</ref> By the end of the war, almost all enlisted men wore a wristwatch and after they were demobilized, the fashion soon caught on: the British ''[[British Horological Institute|Horological Journal]]'' wrote in 1917 that \"the wristlet watch was little used by the sterner sex before the war, but now is seen on the wrist of nearly every man in uniform and of many men in civilian attire.\" By 1930, the ratio of a wrist to pocket watches was 50 to 1. The first successful [[self-winding watch|self-winding]] system was invented by [[John Harwood (watchmaker)|John Harwood]] in 1923.\n\n====Quartz====\nThe commercial introduction of the [[quartz watch]] in 1969 in the form of the Omega [[Omega Electroquartz|Beta 21]] and the Seiko [[Astron (wristwatch)|Astron]] was a revolutionary improvement in watch technology. In place of a balance wheel which oscillated at perhaps 5 or 6 beats per second, they used a [[crystal oscillator|quartz crystal]] [[resonator]] which vibrated at 8,192&nbsp;Hz, driven by a battery-powered [[Electronic oscillator|oscillator circuit]]. Since the 1980s, more quartz watches than mechanical ones have been marketed.\n\n====Hamilton Electric====\nHamilton Electric were the pioneers of the first electric watch <ref>https://wornandwound.com/hamilton-electric-the-race-to-create-the-worlds-first-battery-powered-watch/ Worlds first battery powered watch </ref> unlike the Quartz and the Bulova Accutron this was the first movement to use a battery as a source to oscillate the balance wheel. Hamilton released two models of the Electric: the first released was the Hamilton 500 on 3 January 1957, which was produced into 1959. This model had problems with the contact wires misaligning and the watch returned to Hamilton for alignment. The Hamilton 505 was an improvement on the 500 and was more reliable: the contact wires were removed and a non-adjustable contact on the balance assembly delivered the power to the balance wheel.\n\n== Movement ==\n[[File:Watch Mechanical Quartz Comparison.jpg|thumb|Different kinds of movements move the hands differently as shown in this 2-second exposure.

The movement is fitted with a cylinder escapement.]]\n\nA [[movement (clockwork)|movement]] of a watch is the mechanism that measures the passage of time and displays the current time (and possibly other information including date, month and day). Movements may be entirely mechanical, entirely electronic (potentially with no moving parts), or they might be a blend of both. Most watches intended mainly for timekeeping today have electronic movements, with mechanical hands on the [[watch face]] indicating the time.\n\n=== Mechanical ===\n{{Main|Mechanical watch}}\nCompared to electronic movements, mechanical watches are less accurate, often with errors of seconds per day, and they are sensitive to position, temperature<ref>{{cite web|url=http://us.tagheuer.com/#/temperature|title= Temperature | work = Advice on Your Timepiece |publisher=Tag Heuer}}</ref> and magnetism.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://us.tagheuer.com/#/magnetism|title=Magnetism| work=Advice on Your Timepiece|publisher=Tag Heuer}}</ref> They are also costly to produce, require regular maintenance and adjustments, and are more prone to failures. Nevertheless, the craftsmanship of mechanical watches still attracts interest from part of the watch-buying public, especially among the watch collectors. [[Skeleton watch]]es are designed to leave the mechanism visible for aesthetic purposes.\n\nA mechanical movement uses an [[escapement]] mechanism to control and limit the unwinding and winding parts of a spring, converting what would otherwise be a simple unwinding into a controlled and periodic energy release. A mechanical movement also uses a [[balance wheel]] together with the [[balance spring]] (also known as a hairspring) to control the motion of the gear system of the watch in a manner analogous to the [[pendulum]] of a [[pendulum clock]]. The [[tourbillon]], an optional part for mechanical movements, is a rotating frame for the escapement, which is used to cancel out or reduce the effects of [[gravity|gravitational]] bias to the timekeeping. Due to the complexity of designing a tourbillon, they are very expensive, and only found in prestigious watches.\n\nThe [[pin-lever escapement]] (called the Roskopf movement after its inventor, [[Georges Frederic Roskopf]]), which is a cheaper version of the fully levered movement, was manufactured in huge quantities by many Swiss manufacturers as well as by [[Timex Group USA|Timex]], until it was replaced by quartz movements.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.musketeer.ch/Bilder/uhr_bild/RoskAnker.jpg |title=The original pin-pallet |accessdate=27 May 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120205103752/http://www.musketeer.ch/Bilder/uhr_bild/RoskAnker.jpg |archive-date=5 February 2012 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.musketeer.ch/watches/roskopf.html |title=The Roskopf Watch |publisher=Musketeer.ch |accessdate=27 May 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120401150312/http://www.musketeer.ch/watches/roskopf.html |archive-date=1 April 2012 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.watkinsr.id.au/buffat.html|title=Buffat The Roskopf watch|website=Watkinsr.id.au|accessdate=28 October 2017}}</ref>\n\nTuning-fork watches use a type of electromechanical movement. Introduced by [[Bulova]] in 1960, they use a tuning fork with a precise frequency (most often 360 [[hertz]]) to drive a mechanical watch. The task of converting electronically pulsed fork vibration into rotary movements is done via two tiny jeweled fingers, called pawls. [[Electric watch#Types of electric watches|Tuning-fork watches]] were rendered obsolete when electronic quartz watches were developed. [[Quartz watch]]es were cheaper to produce besides being more accurate.\n\n{{Main|Mainspring}}\nTraditional mechanical watch movements use a spiral spring called a [[mainspring]] as a power source. In ''manual watches'' the spring must be rewound periodically by the user by turning the watch crown. Antique [[pocketwatch]]es were wound by inserting a separate key into a hole in the back of the watch and turning it. Most modern watches are designed to run 40&nbsp; hours on a winding and thus must be wound daily, but some run for several days and a few have 192-hour mainsprings and are wound weekly.\n\n==== Automatic watches ====\n{{Main|Automatic watch}}\n[[File:Jaeger-Lecoultre-p1000838.jpg|thumb|[[Automatic watch]]: An eccentric weight, called a rotor, swings with the movement of the wearer's body and winds the spring]]\n[[File:Seiko 5 Automatic 21 Jewels.png|thumb|upright|Seiko 5 Automatic Watch 21 Jewels]]\n\nA ''self-winding'' or ''automatic'' watch is one that rewinds the mainspring of a mechanical movement by the natural motions of the wearer's body. The first self-winding mechanism was invented for pocket watches in 1770 by Abraham-Louis Perrelet,<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.worldtempus.com/fr/encyclopedie/index-encyclopedique/lhorlogerie-dans-le-monde/lhorlogerie-europeenne-en-chine-watches-wonders/ | title=Watchmaking in Europe and China: Watches & Wonders | work=[[Richemont]] | publisher=Worldtempus |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121011232012/http://www.worldtempus.com/fr/encyclopedie/index-encyclopedique/lhorlogerie-dans-le-monde/lhorlogerie-europeenne-en-chine-watches-wonders/ |archivedate=11 October 2012}}</ref> but the first \"[[self-winding watch|self-winding]]\", or \"automatic\", wristwatch was the invention of a British watch repairer named [[John Harwood (watchmaker)|John Harwood]] in 1923. This type of watch winds itself without requiring any special action by the wearer. It uses an eccentric weight, called a winding rotor, which rotates with the movement of the wearer's wrist. The back-and-forth motion of the winding rotor couples to a [[ratchet (device)|ratchet]] to wind the mainspring automatically. Self-winding watches usually can also be wound manually to keep them running when not worn or if the wearer's wrist motions are inadequate to keep the watch wound.\n\nIn April 2014 the Swatch Group launched the ''sistem51'' wristwatch. It has a purely mechanical movement consisting of only 51 parts, including a novel self-winding mechanism with a transparent oscillating weight. So far, it is the only mechanical movement manufactured entirely on a fully automated assembly line.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.watch-insider.com/featured/exclusive-an-inside-view-of-the-eta-high-tech-swatch-sistem51-production-in-boncourt-in-the-swiss-jura/|title=EXCLUSIVE: An inside view of the ETA high-tech Swatch Sistem51 production in Boncourt in the Swiss Jura \u2013 Watch-Insider.com|date=3 December 2014|website=Watch-insider.com|accessdate=28 October 2017}}</ref> The low parts count and the automated assembly make it an inexpensive mechanical Swiss watch, which can be considered a successor to ''Roskopf'' movements, although of higher quality.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.watch-insider.com/news/swatch-sistem51-swiss-watchmaking-revolution|title=Swatch Sistem51 a Swiss-made watchmaking revolution|website=Watch-insider.com|accessdate=28 October 2017}}</ref>\n\n=== Electronic ===\n{{See also|Electric watch|Quartz clock}}\n[[File:Csem-beta1.jpg|thumb|upright|First quartz wristwatch BETA 1 developed by CEH, Switzerland, 1967]]\nElectronic movements, also known as quartz movements, have few or no moving parts, except a [[quartz]] [[crystal]] which is made to vibrate by the [[piezoelectric effect]]. A varying electric voltage is applied to the crystal, which responds by changing its shape so, in combination with some electronic components, it functions as an [[quartz oscillator|oscillator]]. It [[resonance|resonates]] at a specific highly stable frequency, which is used to accurately pace a timekeeping mechanism. Most quartz movements are primarily electronic but are geared to drive mechanical hands on the face of the watch to provide a traditional analog display of the time, a feature most consumers still prefer.\n\nIn 1959 [[Seiko]] placed an order with Epson (a daughter company of Seiko and the 'brain' behind the quartz revolution) to start developing a quartz wristwatch. The project was codenamed 59A. By the 1964 Tokyo Summer Olympics, Seiko had a working prototype of a portable quartz watch which was used as the time measurements throughout the event.\n\nThe first prototypes of an electronic quartz wristwatch (not just ''portable'' quartz watches as the Seiko timekeeping devices at the Tokyo Olympics in 1964) were made by the CEH research laboratory in Neuch\u00e2tel, Switzerland. From 1965 through 1967 pioneering development work was done on a miniaturized 8192&nbsp; Hz quartz oscillator, a thermo-compensation module, and an in-house-made, dedicated integrated circuit (unlike the hybrid circuits used in the later Seiko Astron wristwatch). As a result, the BETA 1 prototype set new timekeeping performance records at the International Chronometric Competition held at the Observatory of Neuch\u00e2tel in 1967.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ieeeghn.org/wiki/index.php/Milestones:Pioneering_Work_on_the_Quartz_Electronic_Wristwatch,_1962-1967 |title=Milestones:Pioneering Work on the Quartz Electronic Wristwatch, 1962\u20131967 |publisher=Ieeeghn.org |date= |accessdate=27 May 2012}}</ref> In 1970, 18 manufacturers exhibited production versions of the beta 21 wristwatch, including the [[Omega Electroquartz]] as well as [[Patek Philippe]], [[Rolex Oysterquartz]] and Piaget.\n\n[[File:Seiko 35A.jpg|thumb|Quartz Movement of the Seiko Astron, 1969 (Deutsches Uhrenmuseum, Inv. 2010-006)]]\n\nThe first quartz watch to enter production was the [[Seiko]] [[Astron (wristwatch)|35 SQ Astron]], which hit the shelves on 25 December 1969, swiftly followed by the Swiss Beta 21, and then a year later the prototype of one of the world's most accurate wristwatches to date: the [[Omega Marine Chronometer]].

This ended\u2014in less than a decade\u2014almost 100 years of dominance by the mechanical wristwatch legacy. Modern quartz movements are produced in very large quantities, and even the cheapest wristwatches typically have quartz movements. Whereas mechanical movements can typically be off by several seconds a day, an inexpensive quartz movement in a child's wristwatch may still be accurate to within half a second per day\u2014ten times more accurate than a mechanical movement.<ref>Quartz mechanisms usually have a resonant frequency of 32768&nbsp; Hz, chosen for ease of use (being 2<sup>15</sup>). Using a simple 15 stage divide-by-two circuit, this is turned into a 1 pulse per second signal responsible for the watch's timekeeping.</ref>\n\nAfter a consolidation of the mechanical watch industry in Switzerland during the 1970s, mass production of quartz wristwatches took off under the leadership of the [[Swatch Group]] of companies, a Swiss conglomerate with vertical control of the production of Swiss watches and related products. For quartz wristwatches, subsidiaries of Swatch manufacture [[Watch battery|watch batteries]] (Renata), oscillators ([[Oscilloquartz]], now Micro Crystal AG) and integrated circuits (Ebauches Electronic SA, renamed [[EM Microelectronic-Marin]]). The launch of the new SWATCH brand in 1983 was marked by bold new styling, design, and marketing. Today, the Swatch Group maintains its position as the world's largest watch company.\n\n[[Seiko]]'s efforts to combine the quartz and mechanical movements bore fruit after 20 years of research, leading to the introduction of the [[Seiko]] [[Spring Drive]], first in a limited domestic market production in 1999 and to the world in September 2005. The Spring Drive keeps time within quartz standards without the use of a battery, using a traditional mechanical gear train powered by a spring, without the need for a balance wheel either.\n\nIn 2010, Miyota ([[Citizen Watch]]) of [[Japan]] introduced a newly developed movement that uses a 3-pronged quartz crystal that was exclusively produced for [[Bulova]] to be used in the Precisionist or Accutron II line, a new type of quartz watch with ultra-high frequency (262.144&nbsp;kHz) which is claimed to be accurate to +/\u2212 10 seconds a year and has a smooth sweeping second hand rather than one that jumps each second.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.crunchgear.com/2010/03/23/bulova-introduces-the-most-accurate-watch-in-the-world-the-precisionist/ |title=Bulova introduces the most accurate watch in the world, the Precisionist |publisher=Crunch gear |date = 23 March 2010 |accessdate= 8 July 2012}}</ref>\n\nRadio time signal watches are a type of electronic quartz watch which synchronizes ([[time transfer]]s) its time with an external [[Time signal#Radio time signals|time source]] such as in [[atomic clock]]s, time signals from [[GPS]] navigation satellites, the German [[DCF77]] signal in Europe, [[WWVB]] in the US, and others. Movements of this type may\u2014among others\u2014synchronize the time of day and the date, the [[leap year|leap-year]] status and the state of [[daylight saving time]] (on or off). However, other than the radio receiver, these watches are normal quartz watches in all other aspects.\n\nElectronic watches require electricity as a power source, and some mechanical movements and hybrid electronic-mechanical movements also require electricity. Usually, the electricity is provided by a replaceable [[battery (electricity)|battery]]. The first use of electrical power in watches was as a substitute for the mainspring, to remove the need for winding. The first electrically powered watch, the Hamilton Electric 500, was released in 1957 by the [[Hamilton Watch Company]] of [[Lancaster, Pennsylvania]].\n\nWatch batteries (strictly speaking cells, as a battery is composed of multiple cells) are specially designed for their purpose. They are very small and provide tiny amounts of power continuously for very long periods (several years or more). In most cases, replacing the battery requires a trip to a watch-repair shop or watch dealer; this is especially true for watches that are water-resistant, as special tools and procedures are required for the watch to remain water-resistant after battery replacement. Silver-oxide and lithium batteries are popular today; mercury batteries, formerly quite common, are no longer used, for environmental reasons. Cheap batteries may be alkaline, of the same size as silver-oxide cells but providing shorter life. Rechargeable batteries are used in some [[solar-powered watch]]es.\n\nSome electronic watches are powered by the movement of the wearer. For instance, Seiko's [[Automatic quartz|kinetic-powered quartz watches]] use the motion of the wearer's arm: turning a rotating weight which causes a tiny [[Electrical generator|generator]] to supply power to charge a rechargeable battery that runs the watch. The concept is similar to that of self-winding spring movements, except that electrical power is generated instead of mechanical spring tension.\n\n[[Solar powered watch]]es are powered by light. A [[photovoltaic cell]] on the face ([[dial (measurement)|dial]]) of the watch converts light to electricity, which is used to charge a [[rechargeable battery]] or [[capacitor]]. The movement of the watch draws its power from the rechargeable battery or capacitor. As long as the watch is regularly exposed to fairly strong light (such as sunlight), it never needs a battery replacement. Some models need only a few minutes of sunlight to provide weeks of energy (as in the Citizen [[Eco-Drive]]). Some of the early solar watches of the 1970s had innovative and unique designs to accommodate the array of solar cells needed to power them (Synchronar, Nepro, Sicura and some models by Cristalonic, Alba, Seiko, and Citizen). As the decades progressed and the efficiency of the solar cells increased while the power requirements of the movement and display decreased, solar watches began to be designed to look like other conventional watches.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.soluhr.com/|title=History of the Solar Wristwatch|work=Soluhr.com|accessdate=17 January 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070812141728/http://www.soluhr.com/|archive-date=12 August 2007|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nA rarely used power source is the temperature difference between the wearer's arm and the surrounding environment (as applied in the [[Citizen Watch Co., Ltd|Citizen]] [[Eco-Drive]] Thermo).\n\n== Display ==\n=== Analog ===\n[[File:Poljot-Aviator-3133.jpg|thumb|[[Poljot]] [[chronograph]]]]\n[[File:Casio AE12.jpg|alt=Casio AE12|thumb|Casio AE12 LCA (liquid-crystal-analog) watch]]\nTraditionally, watches have displayed the time in analog form, with a numbered dial upon which are mounted at least a rotating hour hand and a longer, rotating minute hand. Many watches also incorporate a third hand that shows the current second of the current minute. Watches powered by quartz usually have a second hand that snaps every second to the next marker. Watches powered by a mechanical movement appears to have a gliding second hand, although it is actually not gliding; the hand merely moves in smaller steps, typically 1/5 of a second, corresponding to the beat (half period) of the balance wheel. In some escapements (for example the ''duplex'' escapement), the hand advances every two beats (full period) of the balance wheel, typically 1/2-second in those watches, or even every four beats (two periods, 1 second), in the ''double duplex'' escapement. A truly gliding second hand is achieved with the ''tri-synchro regulator'' of [[Spring Drive]] watches. All of the hands are normally mechanical, physically rotating on the dial, although a few watches have been produced with \"hands\" that are simulated by a [[liquid crystal display|liquid-crystal display]].\n\nAnalog display of the time is nearly universal in watches sold as jewelry or collectibles, and in these watches, the range of different styles of hands, numbers, and other aspects of the analog dial is very broad. In watches sold for timekeeping, analog display remains very popular, as many people find it easier to read than digital display; but in timekeeping watches the emphasis is on clarity and accurate reading of the time under all conditions (clearly marked digits, easily visible hands, large watch faces, etc.). They are specifically designed for the left wrist with the stem (the knob used for changing the time) on the right side of the watch; this makes it easy to change the time without removing the watch from the wrist. This is the case if one is right-handed and the watch is worn on the left wrist (as is traditionally done). If one is left-handed and wears the watch on the right wrist, one has to remove the watch from the wrist to reset the time or to wind the watch.\n\nAnalog watches, as well as clocks, are often marketed showing a display time of approximately 1:50 or 10:10. This creates a visually pleasing smile-like face on the upper half of the watch, in addition to enclosing the manufacturer's name. Digital displays often show a time of 12:08, where the increase in the number of active segments or pixels gives a positive feeling.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/28/business/media/28adco.html|title=Why Time Stands Still for Watchmakers|work=New York Times|accessdate=28 November 2008|date=28 November 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=The Ten Ten Tenet|url=http://www.snopes.com/business/market/clockhands.asp|work=Snopes.com|publisher=Barbara and David P.

This was only sold for a few years, as production problems and returned (faulty) product forced the company to cease production.\n\nMost watches with LED displays required that the user press a button to see the time displayed for a few seconds because LEDs used so much power that they could not be kept operating continuously. Usually, the LED display color would be red. Watches with LED displays were popular for a few years, but soon the LED displays were superseded by [[liquid crystal display]]s (LCDs), which used less battery power and were much more convenient in use, with the display always visible and no need to push a button before seeing the time. Only in darkness would a button need to be pressed to light the display with a tiny light bulb, later illuminating LEDs.<ref>{{US Patent|4096550}}: W. Boller, M. Donati, J. Fingerle, P.

In 1985, Casio produced the CFX-400 scientific calculator watch. In 1987 Casio produced a watch that could dial telephone numbers and Citizen revealed one that would react to voice. In 1995 Timex released a watch which allowed the wearer to download and store data from a computer to their wrist. Some watches, such as the [[Timex Datalink#Timex Datalink USB|Timex Datalink USB]], feature [[dot matrix]] displays. Since their apex during the late 1980s to mid-1990s high technology fad, digital watches have mostly become simpler, less expensive timepieces with little variety between models.\n\n<gallery widths=\"270px\" heights=\"270px\">\nFile:Jumphour.jpg|[[Cort\u00e9bert (watch manufacturer)|''Cort\u00e9bert'']] digital mechanical pocket watch (1890s)\nFile:Cortjump1.jpg|''Cort\u00e9bert'' digital mechanical wristwatch (1920s)\nFile:PulsarLED.jpg|A silver Pulsar [[Light-emitting diode|LED]] watch from 1976.\nFile:Timex T5E901 Ironman Triathlon 30 Lap FLIX.jpg|A [[Timex Group|Timex]] digital watch with an always-on display of the time and date\n</gallery>\n\n=== Illuminated ===\n{{more citations needed|subsection|date=June 2014}}\n[[File:Tritium-watch.jpg|thumb|left|upright|An illuminated watch face, using tritium]]\nMany watches have displays that are illuminated, so they can be used in darkness. Various methods have been used to achieve this.\n\nMechanical watches often have [[luminous paint]] on their hands and hour marks. In the mid-20th century, radioactive material was often incorporated in the paint, so it would continue to glow without any exposure to light. [[Radium]] was often used but produced small amounts of radiation outside the watch that might have been hazardous.<ref>{{cite web|title=Alan's Vintage Watches|url=http://alanwatch.homestead.com/page9.html|publisher=Radium Watch Dial Pattern|accessdate=16 April 2015}}</ref> [[Tritium]] was used as a replacement, since the radiation it produces has such low energy that it cannot penetrate a watch glass. However, tritium is expensive\u2014it has to be made in a [[nuclear reactor]]\u2014and it has a [[half-life]] of only about 12 years so the paint remains luminous for only a few years. Nowadays, tritium is used in specialized watches, e.g., for military purposes (See [[Tritium illumination]]). For other purposes, luminous paint is sometimes used on analog displays, but no radioactive material is contained in it. This means that the display glows soon after being exposed to light and quickly fades.\n\nWatches that incorporate batteries often have the electric illumination of their displays. However, lights consume far more power than electronic watch movements. To conserve the battery, the light is activated only when the user presses a button. Usually, the light remains lit for a few seconds after the button is released, which allows the user to move the hand out of the way.\n\n[[File:Backlit LCD display.jpg|thumbnail|Views of a [[liquid crystal display]], both with [[electroluminescence|electroluminescent]] backlight switched on (top) and switched off (bottom)]]\n[[File:Casio LCD Watch F-E10.jpg|left|upright|thumbnail| Digital LCD wristwatch Casio type F-E10 with electroluminescent backlighting.]]\nIn some early digital watches, [[LED]] displays were used, which could be read as easily in darkness as in daylight. The user had to press a button to light up the LEDs, which meant that the watch could not be read without the button being pressed, even in full daylight.\n\nIn some types of watches, small [[incandescent]] lamps or LEDs illuminate the display, which is not intrinsically luminous. These tend to produce very non-uniform illumination. Incandescent lamps are very wasteful of electricity.\n\nOther watches use [[Electroluminescence|electroluminescent]] material to produce uniform illumination of the background of the display, against which the hands or digits can be seen.\n\n== Speech synthesis ==\n[[Speech synthesis|Talking]] watches are available, intended for the [[Visual impairment|blind or visually impaired]]. They speak the time out loud at the press of a button. This has the disadvantage of disturbing others nearby or at least alerting the non-[[deaf]] that the wearer is checking the time. Tactile watches are preferred to avoid this awkwardness, but talking watches are preferred for those who are not confident in their ability to read a tactile watch reliably.\n\n==Handedness==\nWristwatches with analog displays generally have a small knob, called the crown, that can be used to adjust the time and, in mechanical watches, wind the spring. Almost always, the crown is located on the right-hand side of the watch so it can be worn of the left wrist for a right-handed individual. This makes it inconvenient to use if the watch is being worn on the right wrist. Some manufacturers offer \"left-hand drive\", aka \"destro\", configured watches which move the crown to the left side<ref>{{cite web|url=http://wornandwound.com/a-guide-to-destro-watches-from-sinn-muhle-citizen-and-more/|title=A Guide to \"Destro\": Watches from Sinn, M\u00fchle, Citizen, and More - Worn & Wound|date=10 May 2016|website=Wornandwound.com|accessdate=28 October 2017}}</ref> making wearing the watch easier for left-handed individuals.\n\nA rarer configuration is the bullhead watch. Bullhead watches are generally, but not exclusively, [[chronograph]]s. The configuration moves the crown and chronograph pushers to the top of the watch. Bullheads are commonly wristwatch chronographs that are intended to be used as stopwatches off the wrist. Examples are the Citizen Bullhead Change Timer<ref>CITIZEN \"BULLHEAD\" CHALLENGE TIMER</ref> and the Omega Seamaster Bullhead.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.hodinkee.com/articles/hands-on-with-the-omega-seamaster-bullhead-live-pics-pricing|title=Hands-On: With The Omega Seamaster Bullhead (Live Pics + Pricing)|website=Hodinkee.com|accessdate=28 October 2017}}</ref>\n\nDigital watches generally have push-buttons that can be used to make adjustments. These are usually equally easy to use on either wrist.\n\n==Functions==\n[[File:Rolex-Submariner.jpg|thumb|upright|left|The [[Rolex]] Submariner, an officially certified chronometer]]\n[[File:Breguet MG 2573.jpg|thumb|upright|left|A [[Breguet (watch)|Breguet]] squelette watch 2933 with [[tourbillon]]]]\n[[File:Patek-Philippe MG 2583.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Perpetual calendar and moonphase wristwatch by [[Patek Philippe]]]]\nCustomarily, watches provide the [[time of day]], giving at least the hour and minute, and often the second. Many also provide the current date, and some (called \"complete calendar\" or \"triple date\" watches) display the day of the week and the month as well. However, many watches also provide a great deal of information beyond the basics of time and date. Some watches include [[alarm]]s. Other elaborate and more expensive watches, both pocket and wrist models, also incorporate [[Striking clock|striking mechanisms]] or [[Repeater (horology)|repeater]] functions, so that the wearer could learn the time by the sound emanating from the watch. This announcement or striking feature is an essential characteristic of true clocks and distinguishes such watches from ordinary [[Clock|timepieces]]. This feature is available on most digital watches.\n\nA ''complicated watch'' has one or more functions beyond the basic function of displaying the time and the date; such a functionality is called a [[Complication (horology)|complication]]. Two popular complications are the '''[[chronograph]]''' complication, which is the ability of the watch movement to function as a [[stopwatch]], and the '''moonphase''' complication, which is a display of the [[lunar phase]]. Other more expensive complications include [[Tourbillon]], [[Perpetual calendar]], [[Minute repeater]], and [[Equation of time]]. A truly complicated watch has many of these complications at once (see [[Calibre 89]] from [[Patek Philippe]] for instance). Some watches can both indicate the [[Qibla compass|direction of Mecca]]<ref>{{cite web|title=Muslim watches |url=http://www.watchismo.com/search.aspx?find=muslim |publisher=Watchismo |accessdate=14 April 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150928004218/http://www.watchismo.com/search.aspx?find=muslim |archivedate=28 September 2015 }}</ref> and have alarms that can be set for all daily prayer requirements.<ref>{{cite web|title=Islamic Watch & Clock|url=http://www.alfajr.com|publisher=ALFAJR|accessdate=14 April 2012}}</ref> Among watch enthusiasts, complicated watches are especially collectible. Some watches include a second 12-hour or 24-hour display for [[UTC]] or [[GMT]].\n\nThe similar-sounding terms '''chronograph''' and '''chronometer''' are often confused, although they mean altogether different things. A chronograph is a watch with an added duration timer, often a [[stopwatch]] complication (as explained above), while a [[chronometer watch]] is a timepiece that has met an industry standard test for performance under pre-defined conditions: a chronometer is a high quality mechanical or a thermo-compensated movement that has been tested and certified to operate within a certain standard of accuracy by the [[COSC]] (Contr\u00f4le Officiel Suisse des Chronom\u00e8tres). The concepts are different but not mutually exclusive; so a watch can be a chronograph, a chronometer, both, or neither.\n\n[[File:Datalink USB Dress Edition.JPG|thumb|upright|Timex Datalink USB Dress edition from 2003 with a dot matrix display; the ''Invasion'' video game is on the screen]]\n\nMany computerized wristwatches have been developed, but none have had long-term sales success, because they have awkward [[user interface]]s due to the tiny screens and buttons, and short battery life. As miniaturized electronics became cheaper, watches have been developed containing [[calculator watch|calculators]], [[tonometer]]s, [[barometer]]s, [[altimeter]]s, a [[compass]] using both hands to show the N/S direction, [[video game]]s, [[digital camera]]s, [[keydrive]]s, [[GPS watch|GPS receivers]] and [[cellular phone]]s. A few [[Astronomical clock#Watches|astronomical watches]] show [[phase of the Moon]] and other celestial phenomena. In the early 1980s [[Seiko]] marketed a watch with a television in it. Such watches have also had the reputation as unsightly and thus mainly [[geek]] toys. Several companies have however attempted to develop a [[computer]] contained in a wristwatch (see also [[wearable computer]]).\n\nElectronic sports watches, combining timekeeping with GPS and/or [[Activity tracker|activity tracking]], address the general [[Physical fitness|fitness]] market and have the potential for commercial success ([[Garmin forerunner]], Garmin Vivofit, Epson,<ref name=\"Epson\" /> announced model of [[Swatch]] Touch series<ref>Hug, Daniel : ''Swatch lanciert 2015 eine intelligente Uhr.''

Their digital equivalents use [[synthesised speech]] to speak the time on command.\n\n=== Fashion ===\nWristwatches and antique pocket watches are often appreciated as [[jewelry]] or as [[collectible]] works of [[art]] rather than just as timepieces.<ref name=NYT012113>{{cite news|title=Buying Back a Forgotten Chinese Heritage|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/21/fashion/21iht-acaw-pocket21.html|accessdate=22 January 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|date=21 January 2013|author=Nazanin Lankarani|quote=We try to explain why it makes sense to spend $500,000 on a watch.}}</ref> This has created several different markets for wristwatches, ranging from very inexpensive but accurate watches (intended for no other purpose than telling the correct time) to extremely expensive watches that serve mainly as personal adornment or as examples of high achievement in miniaturization and precision mechanical engineering.\n\nTraditionally, dress watches appropriate for [[informal attire|informal]] (business), [[semi-formal]], and [[formal wear|formal]] attire are [[gold]], thin, simple, and plain, but increasingly rugged, [[Complication (horology)|complicated]], or sports watches are considered by some to be acceptable for such attire.

These watches are sometimes called [[diving watches]] when they are suitable for [[scuba diving]] or [[saturation diving]]. The [[International Organization for Standardization]] issued a standard for water resistant watches which also prohibits the term \"[[waterproof]]\" to be used with watches, which many countries have adopted.\n\nWater resistance is achieved by the [[gasket]]s which forms a watertight seal, used in conjunction with a sealant applied on the case to help keep water out. The material of the case must also be tested in order to pass as water resistant.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.europastar.com/europastar/watch_tech/waterresistance.jsp|title=Watch Industry Questions and Answers: Water-Resistance|work=Europa Star|publisher=VNU eMedia Inc|accessdate=17 January 2007}}</ref>\n\nNone of the tests defined by [[ISO 2281]] for the Water Resistant mark are suitable to qualify a watch for scuba diving. Such watches are designed for everyday life and must be water resistant during exercises such as swimming. They can be worn in different temperature and pressure conditions but are under no circumstances designed for scuba diving.\n\nThe standards for diving watches are regulated by the [[ISO 6425]] international standard. The watches are tested in static or still water under 125% of the rated (water) pressure, thus a watch with a 200-metre rating will be water resistant if it is stationary and under 250 metres of static water. The testing of the water resistance is fundamentally different from non-dive watches, because every watch has to be fully tested. Besides water resistance standards to a minimum of 100-metre depth rating ISO 6425 also provides eight minimum requirements for mechanical diver's watches for scuba diving (quartz and digital watches have slightly differing readability requirements). For diver's watches for mixed-gas saturation diving two additional requirements have to be met.\n\nWatches are classified by their degree of water resistance, which roughly translates to the following (1 metre = 3.281 feet):<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jwnz.co.nz/page/watches.aspx|title=Watches|website=Jwnz.co.nz|accessdate=28 October 2017}}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Main Article [[ISO 6425#Water resistance classification|ISO 6425]]\n|-\n! nowrap=\"nowrap\" |Water-resistance rating || Suitability || Remarks\n|-\n| Water Resistant or 30&nbsp;m || Suitable for everyday use.

Therefore, a 5 bar watch is equivalent to a 40-metre watch. Some watches are rated in [[Atmosphere (unit)|atmospheres]] (atm), which are roughly equivalent to bar.\n\n=== Navigation ===\n{{Main|Cardinal direction#Watch dial}}\nThere is a traditional method by which an [[analog watch]] can be used to locate north and south. The Sun appears to move in the sky over a 24-hour period while the hour hand of a 12-hour [[clock face]] takes twelve hours to complete one rotation. In the northern hemisphere, if the watch is rotated so that the hour hand points toward the Sun, the point halfway between the hour hand and 12 o'clock will indicate south. For this method to work in the southern hemisphere, the 12 is pointed toward the Sun and the point halfway between the hour hand and 12 o'clock will indicate north. During [[daylight saving time]], the same method can be employed using 1 o'clock instead of 12. This method is accurate enough to be used only at fairly high latitudes.\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Technology}}\n\n{{clear}}\n{{div col|colwidth=23em}}\n* [[American Watchmakers-Clockmakers Institute]]\n* [[Clock]]\n* [[Coin watch]]\n* [[List of most expensive watches sold at auction]]\n* [[List of watch manufacturers]]\n* [[Marine chronometer]]\n* [[National Association of Watch and Clock Collectors]]\n* [[Smartwatch]]\n* [[Tachymeter (watch)]]\n* [[24-hour analog dial]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* [[Edmund Beckett, 1st Baron Grimthorpe|Beckett, Edmund]], [http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/17576 ''A Rudimentary Treatise on Clocks, Watches and Bells''], 1903, from [[Project Gutenberg]]\n* Berner, G.A., [http://www.fhs.ch/berner/?l=en ''Illustrated Professional Dictionary of Horology''], [[Federation of the Swiss Watch Industry]] FH 1961\u20132012\n* Daniels, George, [https://books.google.com/books?id=ZWq8c0xvGxsC&printsec=frontcover ''Watchmaking''], London: Philip Wilson Publishers, 1981 (reprinted 15 June 2011)\n* De Carle, Donald, (Illustrations by E.

Improvements in manufacturing such as the tooth-cutting machine devised by [[Robert Hooke]] allowed some increase in the volume of watch production, although finishing and assembling was still done by hand until well into the 19th century.\n\nA major cause of error in balance wheel timepieces, caused by changes in [[Elasticity (physics)|elasticity]] of the [[balance spring]] from temperature changes, was solved by the bimetallic [[Balance wheel|temperature compensated balance wheel]] invented in 1765 by [[Pierre Le Roy]] and improved by [[Thomas Earnshaw]]. The [[lever escapement]] was the single most important technological breakthrough, and was invented by [[Thomas Mudge (horologist)|Thomas Mudge]] in 1759 and improved by Josiah Emery in 1785, although it only gradually came into use from about 1800 onwards, chiefly in Britain.\n[[File:Acta Eruditorum - II orologi, 1737 \u2013 BEIC 13458392.jpg|thumb|A watch drawn in [[Acta Eruditorum]], 1737]]\nThe British had predominated in watch manufacture for much of the 17th and 18th centuries, but maintained a system of production that was geared towards high-quality products for the elite.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cVUSauNST8EC&dq=British+Watch+Company+mass+production&source=gbs_navlinks_s|title=Manufacturing Time: Global Competition in the Watch Industry, 1795\u20132000|author=Glasmeier, Amy|year=2000|publisher=Guilford Press|accessdate=7 February 2013}}</ref> Although there was an attempt to modernise clock manufacture with [[mass production]] techniques and the application of duplicating tools and machinery by the British Watch Company in 1843, it was in the [[United States]] that this system took off.

[[Elizabeth I]] of England received a wristwatch from [[Robert Dudley, 1st Earl of Leicester|Robert Dudley]] in 1571, described as an armed watch. The oldest surviving wristwatch (then described as a bracelet watch) is one made in 1806 and given to [[Jos\u00e9phine de Beauharnais]].<ref name=Bruton183>{{cite book |last=Bruton |first=Eric |date=2000 |title=The History of Clocks & Watches |publisher=Little, Brown and Company |page=183 |isbn=0316853550}}</ref> From the beginning, wristwatches were almost exclusively worn by women, while men used pocket watches up until the early 20th century.<ref name=\"Evolu\">{{cite web|url=http://www.vintagewatchstraps.com/wristwatches.html|title=The Evolution of the Wristwatch|access-date=8 December 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131208200615/http://vintagewatchstraps.com/wristwatches.html|archive-date=8 December 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nWristwatches were first worn by military men towards the end of the 19th century, when the importance of synchronizing maneuvers during war, without potentially revealing the plan to the enemy through signaling, was increasingly recognized. The Garstin Company of [[London]] patented a \"Watch Wristlet\" design in 1893, but they were probably producing similar designs from the 1880s. Officers in the [[British Army]] began using wristwatches during colonial military campaigns in the 1880s, such as during the [[Third Anglo-Burmese War|Anglo-Burma War]] of 1885.<ref name=\"Evolu\" /> During the [[First Boer War]], the importance of coordinating troop movements and synchronizing attacks against the highly mobile Boer insurgents became paramount, and the use of wristwatches subsequently became widespread among the officer class. The company [[Mappin & Webb]] began production of their successful \"campaign watch\" for soldiers during the [[Battle of Omdurman|campaign at Sudan in 1898]] and accelerated production for the [[Second Boer War]] a few years later.<ref name=\"Evolu\" /> In continental Europe, [[Girard-Perregaux]] and other Swiss watchmakers began supplying German naval officers with wristwatches in about 1880.<ref name=Bruton183 />\n\nEarly models were essentially standard pocket-watches fitted to a leather strap but, by the early 20th century, manufacturers began producing purpose-built wristwatches. The Swiss company Dimier Fr\u00e8res & Cie patented a wristwatch design with the now standard wire lugs in 1903. [[Hans Wilsdorf]] moved to London in 1905 and set up his own business, Wilsdorf & Davis, with his brother-in-law Alfred Davis, providing quality timepieces at affordable prices; the company later became [[Rolex]].<ref>Rolex Jubilee Vade Mecum published by the Rolex Watch Company in 1946.</ref> Wilsdorf was an early convert to the wristwatch, and contracted the Swiss firm Aegler to produce a line of wristwatches.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.qualitytyme.net/pages/rolex_articles/history_of_wristwatch.html|title=The History and Evolution of the Wristwatch.|first=John E.|last=Brozek|publisher=International Watch Magazine}}</ref>\n\nThe impact of the [[First World War]] dramatically shifted public perceptions on the propriety of the man's wristwatch and opened up a mass market in the postwar era. The [[creeping barrage]] artillery tactic, developed during the war, required precise synchronization between the artillery gunners and the infantry advancing behind the barrage. Service watches produced during the War were specially designed for the rigours of [[trench warfare]], with luminous dials and unbreakable glass. The [[War Office]] began issuing wristwatches to combatants from 1917.<ref>{{cite book |last=Hoffman |first=Paul |year=2004 |title=Wings of Madness: Alberto Santos-Dumont and the Invention of Flight |publisher=Hyperion Press |isbn=0-7868-8571-8 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/wingsofmadnessal0000hoff }}</ref> By the end of the war, almost all enlisted men wore a wristwatch and after they were demobilized, the fashion soon caught on: the British ''[[British Horological Institute|Horological Journal]]'' wrote in 1917 that \"the wristlet watch was little used by the sterner sex before the war, but now is seen on the wrist of nearly every man in uniform and of many men in civilian attire.\" By 1930, the ratio of a wrist to pocket watches was 50 to 1. The first successful [[self-winding watch|self-winding]] system was invented by [[John Harwood (watchmaker)|John Harwood]] in 1923.\n\n====Quartz====\nThe commercial introduction of the [[quartz watch]] in 1969 in the form of the Omega [[Omega Electroquartz|Beta 21]] and the Seiko [[Astron (wristwatch)|Astron]] was a revolutionary improvement in watch technology. In place of a balance wheel which oscillated at perhaps 5 or 6 beats per second, they used a [[crystal oscillator|quartz crystal]] [[resonator]] which vibrated at 8,192&nbsp;Hz, driven by a battery-powered [[Electronic oscillator|oscillator circuit]]. Since the 1980s, more quartz watches than mechanical ones have been marketed.\n\n====Hamilton Electric====\nHamilton Electric were the pioneers of the first electric watch <ref>https://wornandwound.com/hamilton-electric-the-race-to-create-the-worlds-first-battery-powered-watch/ Worlds first battery powered watch </ref> unlike the Quartz and the Bulova Accutron this was the first movement to use a battery as a source to oscillate the balance wheel. Hamilton released two models of the Electric: the first released was the Hamilton 500 on 3 January 1957, which was produced into 1959. This model had problems with the contact wires misaligning and the watch returned to Hamilton for alignment. The Hamilton 505 was an improvement on the 500 and was more reliable: the contact wires were removed and a non-adjustable contact on the balance assembly delivered the power to the balance wheel.\n\n== Movement ==\n[[File:Watch Mechanical Quartz Comparison.jpg|thumb|Different kinds of movements move the hands differently as shown in this 2-second exposure.

The movement is fitted with a cylinder escapement.]]\n\nA [[movement (clockwork)|movement]] of a watch is the mechanism that measures the passage of time and displays the current time (and possibly other information including date, month and day). Movements may be entirely mechanical, entirely electronic (potentially with no moving parts), or they might be a blend of both. Most watches intended mainly for timekeeping today have electronic movements, with mechanical hands on the [[watch face]] indicating the time.\n\n=== Mechanical ===\n{{Main|Mechanical watch}}\nCompared to electronic movements, mechanical watches are less accurate, often with errors of seconds per day, and they are sensitive to position, temperature<ref>{{cite web|url=http://us.tagheuer.com/#/temperature|title= Temperature | work = Advice on Your Timepiece |publisher=Tag Heuer}}</ref> and magnetism.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://us.tagheuer.com/#/magnetism|title=Magnetism| work=Advice on Your Timepiece|publisher=Tag Heuer}}</ref> They are also costly to produce, require regular maintenance and adjustments, and are more prone to failures. Nevertheless, the craftsmanship of mechanical watches still attracts interest from part of the watch-buying public, especially among the watch collectors. [[Skeleton watch]]es are designed to leave the mechanism visible for aesthetic purposes.\n\nA mechanical movement uses an [[escapement]] mechanism to control and limit the unwinding and winding parts of a spring, converting what would otherwise be a simple unwinding into a controlled and periodic energy release. A mechanical movement also uses a [[balance wheel]] together with the [[balance spring]] (also known as a hairspring) to control the motion of the gear system of the watch in a manner analogous to the [[pendulum]] of a [[pendulum clock]]. The [[tourbillon]], an optional part for mechanical movements, is a rotating frame for the escapement, which is used to cancel out or reduce the effects of [[gravity|gravitational]] bias to the timekeeping. Due to the complexity of designing a tourbillon, they are very expensive, and only found in prestigious watches.\n\nThe [[pin-lever escapement]] (called the Roskopf movement after its inventor, [[Georges Frederic Roskopf]]), which is a cheaper version of the fully levered movement, was manufactured in huge quantities by many Swiss manufacturers as well as by [[Timex Group USA|Timex]], until it was replaced by quartz movements.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.musketeer.ch/Bilder/uhr_bild/RoskAnker.jpg |title=The original pin-pallet |accessdate=27 May 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120205103752/http://www.musketeer.ch/Bilder/uhr_bild/RoskAnker.jpg |archive-date=5 February 2012 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.musketeer.ch/watches/roskopf.html |title=The Roskopf Watch |publisher=Musketeer.ch |accessdate=27 May 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120401150312/http://www.musketeer.ch/watches/roskopf.html |archive-date=1 April 2012 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.watkinsr.id.au/buffat.html|title=Buffat The Roskopf watch|website=Watkinsr.id.au|accessdate=28 October 2017}}</ref>\n\nTuning-fork watches use a type of electromechanical movement. Introduced by [[Bulova]] in 1960, they use a tuning fork with a precise frequency (most often 360 [[hertz]]) to drive a mechanical watch. The task of converting electronically pulsed fork vibration into rotary movements is done via two tiny jeweled fingers, called pawls. [[Electric watch#Types of electric watches|Tuning-fork watches]] were rendered obsolete when electronic quartz watches were developed. [[Quartz watch]]es were cheaper to produce besides being more accurate.\n\n{{Main|Mainspring}}\nTraditional mechanical watch movements use a spiral spring called a [[mainspring]] as a power source. In ''manual watches'' the spring must be rewound periodically by the user by turning the watch crown. Antique [[pocketwatch]]es were wound by inserting a separate key into a hole in the back of the watch and turning it. Most modern watches are designed to run 40&nbsp; hours on a winding and thus must be wound daily, but some run for several days and a few have 192-hour mainsprings and are wound weekly.\n\n==== Automatic watches ====\n{{Main|Automatic watch}}\n[[File:Jaeger-Lecoultre-p1000838.jpg|thumb|[[Automatic watch]]: An eccentric weight, called a rotor, swings with the movement of the wearer's body and winds the spring]]\n[[File:Seiko 5 Automatic 21 Jewels.png|thumb|upright|Seiko 5 Automatic Watch 21 Jewels]]\n\nA ''self-winding'' or ''automatic'' watch is one that rewinds the mainspring of a mechanical movement by the natural motions of the wearer's body. The first self-winding mechanism was invented for pocket watches in 1770 by Abraham-Louis Perrelet,<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.worldtempus.com/fr/encyclopedie/index-encyclopedique/lhorlogerie-dans-le-monde/lhorlogerie-europeenne-en-chine-watches-wonders/ | title=Watchmaking in Europe and China: Watches & Wonders | work=[[Richemont]] | publisher=Worldtempus |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121011232012/http://www.worldtempus.com/fr/encyclopedie/index-encyclopedique/lhorlogerie-dans-le-monde/lhorlogerie-europeenne-en-chine-watches-wonders/ |archivedate=11 October 2012}}</ref> but the first \"[[self-winding watch|self-winding]]\", or \"automatic\", wristwatch was the invention of a British watch repairer named [[John Harwood (watchmaker)|John Harwood]] in 1923. This type of watch winds itself without requiring any special action by the wearer. It uses an eccentric weight, called a winding rotor, which rotates with the movement of the wearer's wrist. The back-and-forth motion of the winding rotor couples to a [[ratchet (device)|ratchet]] to wind the mainspring automatically. Self-winding watches usually can also be wound manually to keep them running when not worn or if the wearer's wrist motions are inadequate to keep the watch wound.\n\nIn April 2014 the Swatch Group launched the ''sistem51'' wristwatch. It has a purely mechanical movement consisting of only 51 parts, including a novel self-winding mechanism with a transparent oscillating weight. So far, it is the only mechanical movement manufactured entirely on a fully automated assembly line.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.watch-insider.com/featured/exclusive-an-inside-view-of-the-eta-high-tech-swatch-sistem51-production-in-boncourt-in-the-swiss-jura/|title=EXCLUSIVE: An inside view of the ETA high-tech Swatch Sistem51 production in Boncourt in the Swiss Jura \u2013 Watch-Insider.com|date=3 December 2014|website=Watch-insider.com|accessdate=28 October 2017}}</ref> The low parts count and the automated assembly make it an inexpensive mechanical Swiss watch, which can be considered a successor to ''Roskopf'' movements, although of higher quality.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.watch-insider.com/news/swatch-sistem51-swiss-watchmaking-revolution|title=Swatch Sistem51 a Swiss-made watchmaking revolution|website=Watch-insider.com|accessdate=28 October 2017}}</ref>\n\n=== Electronic ===\n{{See also|Electric watch|Quartz clock}}\n[[File:Csem-beta1.jpg|thumb|upright|First quartz wristwatch BETA 1 developed by CEH, Switzerland, 1967]]\nElectronic movements, also known as quartz movements, have few or no moving parts, except a [[quartz]] [[crystal]] which is made to vibrate by the [[piezoelectric effect]]. A varying electric voltage is applied to the crystal, which responds by changing its shape so, in combination with some electronic components, it functions as an [[quartz oscillator|oscillator]]. It [[resonance|resonates]] at a specific highly stable frequency, which is used to accurately pace a timekeeping mechanism. Most quartz movements are primarily electronic but are geared to drive mechanical hands on the face of the watch to provide a traditional analog display of the time, a feature most consumers still prefer.\n\nIn 1959 [[Seiko]] placed an order with Epson (a daughter company of Seiko and the 'brain' behind the quartz revolution) to start developing a quartz wristwatch. The project was codenamed 59A. By the 1964 Tokyo Summer Olympics, Seiko had a working prototype of a portable quartz watch which was used as the time measurements throughout the event.\n\nThe first prototypes of an electronic quartz wristwatch (not just ''portable'' quartz watches as the Seiko timekeeping devices at the Tokyo Olympics in 1964) were made by the CEH research laboratory in Neuch\u00e2tel, Switzerland. From 1965 through 1967 pioneering development work was done on a miniaturized 8192&nbsp; Hz quartz oscillator, a thermo-compensation module, and an in-house-made, dedicated integrated circuit (unlike the hybrid circuits used in the later Seiko Astron wristwatch). As a result, the BETA 1 prototype set new timekeeping performance records at the International Chronometric Competition held at the Observatory of Neuch\u00e2tel in 1967.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ieeeghn.org/wiki/index.php/Milestones:Pioneering_Work_on_the_Quartz_Electronic_Wristwatch,_1962-1967 |title=Milestones:Pioneering Work on the Quartz Electronic Wristwatch, 1962\u20131967 |publisher=Ieeeghn.org |date= |accessdate=27 May 2012}}</ref> In 1970, 18 manufacturers exhibited production versions of the beta 21 wristwatch, including the [[Omega Electroquartz]] as well as [[Patek Philippe]], [[Rolex Oysterquartz]] and Piaget.\n\n[[File:Seiko 35A.jpg|thumb|Quartz Movement of the Seiko Astron, 1969 (Deutsches Uhrenmuseum, Inv. 2010-006)]]\n\nThe first quartz watch to enter production was the [[Seiko]] [[Astron (wristwatch)|35 SQ Astron]], which hit the shelves on 25 December 1969, swiftly followed by the Swiss Beta 21, and then a year later the prototype of one of the world's most accurate wristwatches to date: the [[Omega Marine Chronometer]].

This ended\u2014in less than a decade\u2014almost 100 years of dominance by the mechanical wristwatch legacy. Modern quartz movements are produced in very large quantities, and even the cheapest wristwatches typically have quartz movements. Whereas mechanical movements can typically be off by several seconds a day, an inexpensive quartz movement in a child's wristwatch may still be accurate to within half a second per day\u2014ten times more accurate than a mechanical movement.<ref>Quartz mechanisms usually have a resonant frequency of 32768&nbsp; Hz, chosen for ease of use (being 2<sup>15</sup>). Using a simple 15 stage divide-by-two circuit, this is turned into a 1 pulse per second signal responsible for the watch's timekeeping.</ref>\n\nAfter a consolidation of the mechanical watch industry in Switzerland during the 1970s, mass production of quartz wristwatches took off under the leadership of the [[Swatch Group]] of companies, a Swiss conglomerate with vertical control of the production of Swiss watches and related products. For quartz wristwatches, subsidiaries of Swatch manufacture [[Watch battery|watch batteries]] (Renata), oscillators ([[Oscilloquartz]], now Micro Crystal AG) and integrated circuits (Ebauches Electronic SA, renamed [[EM Microelectronic-Marin]]). The launch of the new SWATCH brand in 1983 was marked by bold new styling, design, and marketing. Today, the Swatch Group maintains its position as the world's largest watch company.\n\n[[Seiko]]'s efforts to combine the quartz and mechanical movements bore fruit after 20 years of research, leading to the introduction of the [[Seiko]] [[Spring Drive]], first in a limited domestic market production in 1999 and to the world in September 2005. The Spring Drive keeps time within quartz standards without the use of a battery, using a traditional mechanical gear train powered by a spring, without the need for a balance wheel either.\n\nIn 2010, Miyota ([[Citizen Watch]]) of [[Japan]] introduced a newly developed movement that uses a 3-pronged quartz crystal that was exclusively produced for [[Bulova]] to be used in the Precisionist or Accutron II line, a new type of quartz watch with ultra-high frequency (262.144&nbsp;kHz) which is claimed to be accurate to +/\u2212 10 seconds a year and has a smooth sweeping second hand rather than one that jumps each second.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.crunchgear.com/2010/03/23/bulova-introduces-the-most-accurate-watch-in-the-world-the-precisionist/ |title=Bulova introduces the most accurate watch in the world, the Precisionist |publisher=Crunch gear |date = 23 March 2010 |accessdate= 8 July 2012}}</ref>\n\nRadio time signal watches are a type of electronic quartz watch which synchronizes ([[time transfer]]s) its time with an external [[Time signal#Radio time signals|time source]] such as in [[atomic clock]]s, time signals from [[GPS]] navigation satellites, the German [[DCF77]] signal in Europe, [[WWVB]] in the US, and others. Movements of this type may\u2014among others\u2014synchronize the time of day and the date, the [[leap year|leap-year]] status and the state of [[daylight saving time]] (on or off). However, other than the radio receiver, these watches are normal quartz watches in all other aspects.\n\nElectronic watches require electricity as a power source, and some mechanical movements and hybrid electronic-mechanical movements also require electricity. Usually, the electricity is provided by a replaceable [[battery (electricity)|battery]]. The first use of electrical power in watches was as a substitute for the mainspring, to remove the need for winding. The first electrically powered watch, the Hamilton Electric 500, was released in 1957 by the [[Hamilton Watch Company]] of [[Lancaster, Pennsylvania]].\n\nWatch batteries (strictly speaking cells, as a battery is composed of multiple cells) are specially designed for their purpose. They are very small and provide tiny amounts of power continuously for very long periods (several years or more). In most cases, replacing the battery requires a trip to a watch-repair shop or watch dealer; this is especially true for watches that are water-resistant, as special tools and procedures are required for the watch to remain water-resistant after battery replacement. Silver-oxide and lithium batteries are popular today; mercury batteries, formerly quite common, are no longer used, for environmental reasons. Cheap batteries may be alkaline, of the same size as silver-oxide cells but providing shorter life. Rechargeable batteries are used in some [[solar-powered watch]]es.\n\nSome electronic watches are powered by the movement of the wearer. For instance, Seiko's [[Automatic quartz|kinetic-powered quartz watches]] use the motion of the wearer's arm: turning a rotating weight which causes a tiny [[Electrical generator|generator]] to supply power to charge a rechargeable battery that runs the watch. The concept is similar to that of self-winding spring movements, except that electrical power is generated instead of mechanical spring tension.\n\n[[Solar powered watch]]es are powered by light. A [[photovoltaic cell]] on the face ([[dial (measurement)|dial]]) of the watch converts light to electricity, which is used to charge a [[rechargeable battery]] or [[capacitor]]. The movement of the watch draws its power from the rechargeable battery or capacitor. As long as the watch is regularly exposed to fairly strong light (such as sunlight), it never needs a battery replacement. Some models need only a few minutes of sunlight to provide weeks of energy (as in the Citizen [[Eco-Drive]]). Some of the early solar watches of the 1970s had innovative and unique designs to accommodate the array of solar cells needed to power them (Synchronar, Nepro, Sicura and some models by Cristalonic, Alba, Seiko, and Citizen). As the decades progressed and the efficiency of the solar cells increased while the power requirements of the movement and display decreased, solar watches began to be designed to look like other conventional watches.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.soluhr.com/|title=History of the Solar Wristwatch|work=Soluhr.com|accessdate=17 January 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070812141728/http://www.soluhr.com/|archive-date=12 August 2007|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nA rarely used power source is the temperature difference between the wearer's arm and the surrounding environment (as applied in the [[Citizen Watch Co., Ltd|Citizen]] [[Eco-Drive]] Thermo).\n\n== Display ==\n=== Analog ===\n[[File:Poljot-Aviator-3133.jpg|thumb|[[Poljot]] [[chronograph]]]]\n[[File:Casio AE12.jpg|alt=Casio AE12|thumb|Casio AE12 LCA (liquid-crystal-analog) watch]]\nTraditionally, watches have displayed the time in analog form, with a numbered dial upon which are mounted at least a rotating hour hand and a longer, rotating minute hand. Many watches also incorporate a third hand that shows the current second of the current minute. Watches powered by quartz usually have a second hand that snaps every second to the next marker. Watches powered by a mechanical movement appears to have a gliding second hand, although it is actually not gliding; the hand merely moves in smaller steps, typically 1/5 of a second, corresponding to the beat (half period) of the balance wheel. In some escapements (for example the ''duplex'' escapement), the hand advances every two beats (full period) of the balance wheel, typically 1/2-second in those watches, or even every four beats (two periods, 1 second), in the ''double duplex'' escapement. A truly gliding second hand is achieved with the ''tri-synchro regulator'' of [[Spring Drive]] watches. All of the hands are normally mechanical, physically rotating on the dial, although a few watches have been produced with \"hands\" that are simulated by a [[liquid crystal display|liquid-crystal display]].\n\nAnalog display of the time is nearly universal in watches sold as jewelry or collectibles, and in these watches, the range of different styles of hands, numbers, and other aspects of the analog dial is very broad. In watches sold for timekeeping, analog display remains very popular, as many people find it easier to read than digital display; but in timekeeping watches the emphasis is on clarity and accurate reading of the time under all conditions (clearly marked digits, easily visible hands, large watch faces, etc.). They are specifically designed for the left wrist with the stem (the knob used for changing the time) on the right side of the watch; this makes it easy to change the time without removing the watch from the wrist. This is the case if one is right-handed and the watch is worn on the left wrist (as is traditionally done). If one is left-handed and wears the watch on the right wrist, one has to remove the watch from the wrist to reset the time or to wind the watch.\n\nAnalog watches, as well as clocks, are often marketed showing a display time of approximately 1:50 or 10:10. This creates a visually pleasing smile-like face on the upper half of the watch, in addition to enclosing the manufacturer's name. Digital displays often show a time of 12:08, where the increase in the number of active segments or pixels gives a positive feeling.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/28/business/media/28adco.html|title=Why Time Stands Still for Watchmakers|work=New York Times|accessdate=28 November 2008|date=28 November 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=The Ten Ten Tenet|url=http://www.snopes.com/business/market/clockhands.asp|work=Snopes.com|publisher=Barbara and David P.

This was only sold for a few years, as production problems and returned (faulty) product forced the company to cease production.\n\nMost watches with LED displays required that the user press a button to see the time displayed for a few seconds because LEDs used so much power that they could not be kept operating continuously. Usually, the LED display color would be red. Watches with LED displays were popular for a few years, but soon the LED displays were superseded by [[liquid crystal display]]s (LCDs), which used less battery power and were much more convenient in use, with the display always visible and no need to push a button before seeing the time. Only in darkness would a button need to be pressed to light the display with a tiny light bulb, later illuminating LEDs.<ref>{{US Patent|4096550}}: W. Boller, M. Donati, J. Fingerle, P.

In 1985, Casio produced the CFX-400 scientific calculator watch. In 1987 Casio produced a watch that could dial telephone numbers and Citizen revealed one that would react to voice. In 1995 Timex released a watch which allowed the wearer to download and store data from a computer to their wrist. Some watches, such as the [[Timex Datalink#Timex Datalink USB|Timex Datalink USB]], feature [[dot matrix]] displays. Since their apex during the late 1980s to mid-1990s high technology fad, digital watches have mostly become simpler, less expensive timepieces with little variety between models.\n\n<gallery widths=\"270px\" heights=\"270px\">\nFile:Jumphour.jpg|[[Cort\u00e9bert (watch manufacturer)|''Cort\u00e9bert'']] digital mechanical pocket watch (1890s)\nFile:Cortjump1.jpg|''Cort\u00e9bert'' digital mechanical wristwatch (1920s)\nFile:PulsarLED.jpg|A silver Pulsar [[Light-emitting diode|LED]] watch from 1976.\nFile:Timex T5E901 Ironman Triathlon 30 Lap FLIX.jpg|A [[Timex Group|Timex]] digital watch with an always-on display of the time and date\n</gallery>\n\n=== Illuminated ===\n{{more citations needed|subsection|date=June 2014}}\n[[File:Tritium-watch.jpg|thumb|left|upright|An illuminated watch face, using tritium]]\nMany watches have displays that are illuminated, so they can be used in darkness. Various methods have been used to achieve this.\n\nMechanical watches often have [[luminous paint]] on their hands and hour marks. In the mid-20th century, radioactive material was often incorporated in the paint, so it would continue to glow without any exposure to light. [[Radium]] was often used but produced small amounts of radiation outside the watch that might have been hazardous.<ref>{{cite web|title=Alan's Vintage Watches|url=http://alanwatch.homestead.com/page9.html|publisher=Radium Watch Dial Pattern|accessdate=16 April 2015}}</ref> [[Tritium]] was used as a replacement, since the radiation it produces has such low energy that it cannot penetrate a watch glass. However, tritium is expensive\u2014it has to be made in a [[nuclear reactor]]\u2014and it has a [[half-life]] of only about 12 years so the paint remains luminous for only a few years. Nowadays, tritium is used in specialized watches, e.g., for military purposes (See [[Tritium illumination]]). For other purposes, luminous paint is sometimes used on analog displays, but no radioactive material is contained in it. This means that the display glows soon after being exposed to light and quickly fades.\n\nWatches that incorporate batteries often have the electric illumination of their displays. However, lights consume far more power than electronic watch movements. To conserve the battery, the light is activated only when the user presses a button. Usually, the light remains lit for a few seconds after the button is released, which allows the user to move the hand out of the way.\n\n[[File:Backlit LCD display.jpg|thumbnail|Views of a [[liquid crystal display]], both with [[electroluminescence|electroluminescent]] backlight switched on (top) and switched off (bottom)]]\n[[File:Casio LCD Watch F-E10.jpg|left|upright|thumbnail| Digital LCD wristwatch Casio type F-E10 with electroluminescent backlighting.]]\nIn some early digital watches, [[LED]] displays were used, which could be read as easily in darkness as in daylight. The user had to press a button to light up the LEDs, which meant that the watch could not be read without the button being pressed, even in full daylight.\n\nIn some types of watches, small [[incandescent]] lamps or LEDs illuminate the display, which is not intrinsically luminous. These tend to produce very non-uniform illumination. Incandescent lamps are very wasteful of electricity.\n\nOther watches use [[Electroluminescence|electroluminescent]] material to produce uniform illumination of the background of the display, against which the hands or digits can be seen.\n\n== Speech synthesis ==\n[[Speech synthesis|Talking]] watches are available, intended for the [[Visual impairment|blind or visually impaired]]. They speak the time out loud at the press of a button. This has the disadvantage of disturbing others nearby or at least alerting the non-[[deaf]] that the wearer is checking the time. Tactile watches are preferred to avoid this awkwardness, but talking watches are preferred for those who are not confident in their ability to read a tactile watch reliably.\n\n==Handedness==\nWristwatches with analog displays generally have a small knob, called the crown, that can be used to adjust the time and, in mechanical watches, wind the spring. Almost always, the crown is located on the right-hand side of the watch so it can be worn of the left wrist for a right-handed individual. This makes it inconvenient to use if the watch is being worn on the right wrist. Some manufacturers offer \"left-hand drive\", aka \"destro\", configured watches which move the crown to the left side<ref>{{cite web|url=http://wornandwound.com/a-guide-to-destro-watches-from-sinn-muhle-citizen-and-more/|title=A Guide to \"Destro\": Watches from Sinn, M\u00fchle, Citizen, and More - Worn & Wound|date=10 May 2016|website=Wornandwound.com|accessdate=28 October 2017}}</ref> making wearing the watch easier for left-handed individuals.\n\nA rarer configuration is the bullhead watch. Bullhead watches are generally, but not exclusively, [[chronograph]]s. The configuration moves the crown and chronograph pushers to the top of the watch. Bullheads are commonly wristwatch chronographs that are intended to be used as stopwatches off the wrist. Examples are the Citizen Bullhead Change Timer<ref>CITIZEN \"BULLHEAD\" CHALLENGE TIMER</ref> and the Omega Seamaster Bullhead.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.hodinkee.com/articles/hands-on-with-the-omega-seamaster-bullhead-live-pics-pricing|title=Hands-On: With The Omega Seamaster Bullhead (Live Pics + Pricing)|website=Hodinkee.com|accessdate=28 October 2017}}</ref>\n\nDigital watches generally have push-buttons that can be used to make adjustments. These are usually equally easy to use on either wrist.\n\n==Functions==\n[[File:Rolex-Submariner.jpg|thumb|upright|left|The [[Rolex]] Submariner, an officially certified chronometer]]\n[[File:Breguet MG 2573.jpg|thumb|upright|left|A [[Breguet (watch)|Breguet]] squelette watch 2933 with [[tourbillon]]]]\n[[File:Patek-Philippe MG 2583.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Perpetual calendar and moonphase wristwatch by [[Patek Philippe]]]]\nCustomarily, watches provide the [[time of day]], giving at least the hour and minute, and often the second. Many also provide the current date, and some (called \"complete calendar\" or \"triple date\" watches) display the day of the week and the month as well. However, many watches also provide a great deal of information beyond the basics of time and date. Some watches include [[alarm]]s. Other elaborate and more expensive watches, both pocket and wrist models, also incorporate [[Striking clock|striking mechanisms]] or [[Repeater (horology)|repeater]] functions, so that the wearer could learn the time by the sound emanating from the watch. This announcement or striking feature is an essential characteristic of true clocks and distinguishes such watches from ordinary [[Clock|timepieces]]. This feature is available on most digital watches.\n\nA ''complicated watch'' has one or more functions beyond the basic function of displaying the time and the date; such a functionality is called a [[Complication (horology)|complication]]. Two popular complications are the '''[[chronograph]]''' complication, which is the ability of the watch movement to function as a [[stopwatch]], and the '''moonphase''' complication, which is a display of the [[lunar phase]]. Other more expensive complications include [[Tourbillon]], [[Perpetual calendar]], [[Minute repeater]], and [[Equation of time]]. A truly complicated watch has many of these complications at once (see [[Calibre 89]] from [[Patek Philippe]] for instance). Some watches can both indicate the [[Qibla compass|direction of Mecca]]<ref>{{cite web|title=Muslim watches |url=http://www.watchismo.com/search.aspx?find=muslim |publisher=Watchismo |accessdate=14 April 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150928004218/http://www.watchismo.com/search.aspx?find=muslim |archivedate=28 September 2015 }}</ref> and have alarms that can be set for all daily prayer requirements.<ref>{{cite web|title=Islamic Watch & Clock|url=http://www.alfajr.com|publisher=ALFAJR|accessdate=14 April 2012}}</ref> Among watch enthusiasts, complicated watches are especially collectible. Some watches include a second 12-hour or 24-hour display for [[UTC]] or [[GMT]].\n\nThe similar-sounding terms '''chronograph''' and '''chronometer''' are often confused, although they mean altogether different things. A chronograph is a watch with an added duration timer, often a [[stopwatch]] complication (as explained above), while a [[chronometer watch]] is a timepiece that has met an industry standard test for performance under pre-defined conditions: a chronometer is a high quality mechanical or a thermo-compensated movement that has been tested and certified to operate within a certain standard of accuracy by the [[COSC]] (Contr\u00f4le Officiel Suisse des Chronom\u00e8tres). The concepts are different but not mutually exclusive; so a watch can be a chronograph, a chronometer, both, or neither.\n\n[[File:Datalink USB Dress Edition.JPG|thumb|upright|Timex Datalink USB Dress edition from 2003 with a dot matrix display; the ''Invasion'' video game is on the screen]]\n\nMany computerized wristwatches have been developed, but none have had long-term sales success, because they have awkward [[user interface]]s due to the tiny screens and buttons, and short battery life. As miniaturized electronics became cheaper, watches have been developed containing [[calculator watch|calculators]], [[tonometer]]s, [[barometer]]s, [[altimeter]]s, a [[compass]] using both hands to show the N/S direction, [[video game]]s, [[digital camera]]s, [[keydrive]]s, [[GPS watch|GPS receivers]] and [[cellular phone]]s. A few [[Astronomical clock#Watches|astronomical watches]] show [[phase of the Moon]] and other celestial phenomena. In the early 1980s [[Seiko]] marketed a watch with a television in it. Such watches have also had the reputation as unsightly and thus mainly [[geek]] toys. Several companies have however attempted to develop a [[computer]] contained in a wristwatch (see also [[wearable computer]]).\n\nElectronic sports watches, combining timekeeping with GPS and/or [[Activity tracker|activity tracking]], address the general [[Physical fitness|fitness]] market and have the potential for commercial success ([[Garmin forerunner]], Garmin Vivofit, Epson,<ref name=\"Epson\" /> announced model of [[Swatch]] Touch series<ref>Hug, Daniel : ''Swatch lanciert 2015 eine intelligente Uhr.''

Their digital equivalents use [[synthesised speech]] to speak the time on command.\n\n=== Fashion ===\nWristwatches and antique pocket watches are often appreciated as [[jewelry]] or as [[collectible]] works of [[art]] rather than just as timepieces.<ref name=NYT012113>{{cite news|title=Buying Back a Forgotten Chinese Heritage|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/21/fashion/21iht-acaw-pocket21.html|accessdate=22 January 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|date=21 January 2013|author=Nazanin Lankarani|quote=We try to explain why it makes sense to spend $500,000 on a watch.}}</ref> This has created several different markets for wristwatches, ranging from very inexpensive but accurate watches (intended for no other purpose than telling the correct time) to extremely expensive watches that serve mainly as personal adornment or as examples of high achievement in miniaturization and precision mechanical engineering.\n\nTraditionally, dress watches appropriate for [[informal attire|informal]] (business), [[semi-formal]], and [[formal wear|formal]] attire are [[gold]], thin, simple, and plain, but increasingly rugged, [[Complication (horology)|complicated]], or sports watches are considered by some to be acceptable for such attire. Some dress watches have a [[cabochon]] on the crown or [[facet]]ed [[gemstone]]s on the face, [[bezel setting|bezel]], or bracelet. Some are made entirely of faceted [[sapphire]] ([[corundum]]).\n\nMany fashions and [[department store]]s offer a variety of less-expensive, trendy, \"[[costume jewelry|costume]]\" watches (usually for women), many of which are similar in quality to basic quartz timepieces but which feature bolder designs. In the 1980s, the Swiss [[Swatch]] company hired graphic designers to redesign a new annual collection of non-repairable watches.\n\nTrade in [[counterfeit watch]]es, which mimic expensive brand-name watches, constitutes an estimated {{USD|1 billion}} market per year.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.havocscope.com/counterfeit-watches-market-value/|title=Havocscope Counterfeit Watches Market Value: $1 billion}}</ref>\n\n=== Space ===\n[[File:OMEGA-Speedmaster-Professional-Front.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Omega Speedmaster]], selected by [[NASA]] for use on space missions in the 1960s.]]\n\nThe [[Weightlessness|zero-gravity]] environment and other extreme conditions encountered by [[astronaut]]s in [[Outer space|space]] require the use of specially tested watches.\n\nThe first ever watch to be sent into space was a Russian \"[[Pobeda (watch)|Pobeda]]\" watch from the [[Petrodvorets Watch Factory]]. It was sent on a single orbit flight on the spaceship [[Korabl-Sputnik 4]] on 9 March 1961.

These watches are sometimes called [[diving watches]] when they are suitable for [[scuba diving]] or [[saturation diving]]. The [[International Organization for Standardization]] issued a standard for water resistant watches which also prohibits the term \"[[waterproof]]\" to be used with watches, which many countries have adopted.\n\nWater resistance is achieved by the [[gasket]]s which forms a watertight seal, used in conjunction with a sealant applied on the case to help keep water out. The material of the case must also be tested in order to pass as water resistant.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.europastar.com/europastar/watch_tech/waterresistance.jsp|title=Watch Industry Questions and Answers: Water-Resistance|work=Europa Star|publisher=VNU eMedia Inc|accessdate=17 January 2007}}</ref>\n\nNone of the tests defined by [[ISO 2281]] for the Water Resistant mark are suitable to qualify a watch for scuba diving. Such watches are designed for everyday life and must be water resistant during exercises such as swimming. They can be worn in different temperature and pressure conditions but are under no circumstances designed for scuba diving.\n\nThe standards for diving watches are regulated by the [[ISO 6425]] international standard. The watches are tested in static or still water under 125% of the rated (water) pressure, thus a watch with a 200-metre rating will be water resistant if it is stationary and under 250 metres of static water. The testing of the water resistance is fundamentally different from non-dive watches, because every watch has to be fully tested. Besides water resistance standards to a minimum of 100-metre depth rating ISO 6425 also provides eight minimum requirements for mechanical diver's watches for scuba diving (quartz and digital watches have slightly differing readability requirements). For diver's watches for mixed-gas saturation diving two additional requirements have to be met.\n\nWatches are classified by their degree of water resistance, which roughly translates to the following (1 metre = 3.281 feet):<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jwnz.co.nz/page/watches.aspx|title=Watches|website=Jwnz.co.nz|accessdate=28 October 2017}}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Main Article [[ISO 6425#Water resistance classification|ISO 6425]]\n|-\n! nowrap=\"nowrap\" |Water-resistance rating || Suitability || Remarks\n|-\n| Water Resistant or 30&nbsp;m || Suitable for everyday use.

Therefore, a 5 bar watch is equivalent to a 40-metre watch. Some watches are rated in [[Atmosphere (unit)|atmospheres]] (atm), which are roughly equivalent to bar.\n\n=== Navigation ===\n{{Main|Cardinal direction#Watch dial}}\nThere is a traditional method by which an [[analog watch]] can be used to locate north and south. The Sun appears to move in the sky over a 24-hour period while the hour hand of a 12-hour [[clock face]] takes twelve hours to complete one rotation. In the northern hemisphere, if the watch is rotated so that the hour hand points toward the Sun, the point halfway between the hour hand and 12 o'clock will indicate south. For this method to work in the southern hemisphere, the 12 is pointed toward the Sun and the point halfway between the hour hand and 12 o'clock will indicate north. During [[daylight saving time]], the same method can be employed using 1 o'clock instead of 12. This method is accurate enough to be used only at fairly high latitudes.\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Technology}}\n\n{{clear}}\n{{div col|colwidth=23em}}\n* [[American Watchmakers-Clockmakers Institute]]\n* [[Clock]]\n* [[Coin watch]]\n* [[List of most expensive watches sold at auction]]\n* [[List of watch manufacturers]]\n* [[Marine chronometer]]\n* [[National Association of Watch and Clock Collectors]]\n* [[Smartwatch]]\n* [[Tachymeter (watch)]]\n* [[24-hour analog dial]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* [[Edmund Beckett, 1st Baron Grimthorpe|Beckett, Edmund]], [http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/17576 ''A Rudimentary Treatise on Clocks, Watches and Bells''], 1903, from [[Project Gutenberg]]\n* Berner, G.A., [http://www.fhs.ch/berner/?l=en ''Illustrated Professional Dictionary of Horology''], [[Federation of the Swiss Watch Industry]] FH 1961\u20132012\n* Daniels, George, [https://books.google.com/books?id=ZWq8c0xvGxsC&printsec=frontcover ''Watchmaking''], London: Philip Wilson Publishers, 1981 (reprinted 15 June 2011)\n* De Carle, Donald, (Illustrations by E.

{"title_page": "Ring (jewellery)", "text_new": "[[File:Ring Ruby.jpg|upright=1.35|thumb|[[Ruby]] ring]]\n\nA '''ring''' is a round band, usually of [[metal]], worn as ornamental [[jewellery]]. The term \"ring\" by itself always denotes jewellery worn on the finger; when worn as an ornament elsewhere, the body part is specified, e.g. [[earring]]s, [[Neck_ring|neck rings]], [[arm ring]]s, and [[toe ring]]s. Rings always fit snugly around or in the part of the body they ornament, so bands worn loosely, like a [[Bracelet|bracelet]], are not rings.  Rings may be made of almost any hard material: [[wood]], [[bone]], [[rock (geology)|stone]], [[metal]], [[glass]], [[gemstone]] or [[plastic]]. They may be set with gemstones ([[diamond]], [[ruby]], [[sapphire]] or [[emerald]]) or with other types of stone or glass.\n\nAlthough people wear some rings as mere ornaments, or as conspicuous displays of wealth, rings have symbolic functions in relation to marriage, exceptional achievement, high status or authority, membership in an organization, and the like.  Rings can be made to sport [[insignia]] to be transferred in an impression in a wax seal, or outfitted with a small compartment in which to conceal things. In myth, [[fable]], and fiction, rings are often endowed with spiritual or supernatural significance.\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Ring parts.svg|thumb|right|The parts of a ring: 1) hoop, 2) shoulder, 3) [[Bezel (jewellery)|bezel]], and 4) stone or gem in setting or mounting]]\n\n===Ancient India===\n\nAlong with the rings,<ref>{{cite book|title=Studies in the Development of Ornaments and Jewellery in Proto-historic India, Volume 41|quote=Finger rings and ringstones have been found at practically all levels of the Indus Valley Civilization|page=130}}</ref> other types of jewelleries including necklace, rings, bracelets, earrings, bangles, pendants, and others have been discovered from 3rd millennium BC civilization [[Indus Valley Civilization]].

Although it has been thought that worn on specific fingers for specific purpose enhanced their powers, most people simply wear them on any finger of which they fit.\n\nThumb rings were originally worn to protect the thumb from injuries caused by the launching of arrows and are a sign of an archer.\n\n==Size==\n{{Main|Ring size}}\n\nWhile the [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] standard defines ring size in terms of the inner circumference in millimeters various countries have traditional sizing systems that are still used.    Sizing beads functionally reduce the ring size and are small metal beads added to the inner surface of a ring to hold it in place against the finger; they have the advantage of being easily added or removed.\n\n==Styles==\nAfter several thousand years of ring manufacture the total number of styles produced is vast.

The term \"ring\" by itself always denotes jewellery worn on the finger; when worn as an ornament elsewhere, the body part is specified, e.g. [[earring]]s, [[Neck_ring|neck rings]], [[arm ring]]s, and [[toe ring]]s. Rings always fit snugly around or in the part of the body they ornament, so bands worn loosely, like a [[Bracelet|bracelet]], are not rings.  Rings may be made of almost any hard material: [[wood]], [[bone]], [[rock (geology)|stone]], [[metal]], [[glass]], [[gemstone]] or [[plastic]]. They may be set with gemstones ([[diamond]], [[ruby]], [[sapphire]] or [[emerald]]) or with other types of stone or glass.\n\nAlthough people wear some rings as mere ornaments, or as conspicuous displays of wealth, rings have symbolic functions in relation to marriage, exceptional achievement, high status or authority, membership in an organization, and the like.  Rings can be made to sport [[insignia]] to be transferred in an impression in a wax seal, or outfitted with a small compartment in which to conceal things.
