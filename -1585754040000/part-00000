The communist movement in Nepal has split into factions multiple times and multiple factions have come together into a single fold at times as well. It has a history of getting banned from open political discourse; as well as multiple instances of embracing [[Guerrilla warfare|guerrilla insurgency]], most notably, the [[Maoism|Maoist]] insurgency in the 1990s and early 2000s that led to the [[Nepalese civil war]], claiming at least 15,000 lives. After the Maoists and other main political parties (communist and otherwise) formed a united coalition, launching a successful [[2006 democracy movement in Nepal|peaceful civil resistance]] against the [[dictator]]ial [[Coup d'\u00e9tat|coup d'\u00e9tat]] by the [[monarchy]], which resulted in the [[abolition of monarchy]] and drafting of a [[Constitution of Nepal|new constitution]] affirming Nepal as a [[Secularity|secular]], [[Federalism|federal]], [[Parliamentary system|democratic]] [[republic]] striving towards [[democratic socialism]], the two main communist parties of Nepal contested the first election according to the new constitution as a [[coalition]], eventually leading to the [[Nepal Communist Party|unification of two parties]] with a strong majority in the [[Federal Parliament of Nepal|federal parliament]] as well as six out of [[Provinces of Nepal|seven provinces]] of Nepal.\n\n==History==\nCommunism arrived relatively late in Nepal because of the country's isolation from the rest of the world during the Rana regime.<ref name=mr2>{{Cite web|url=https://myrepublica.nagariknetwork.com/news/2513/|title=Recalling Pushpa Lal|first=Dipendra|last=Adhikari|website=My Republica}}</ref> By 1930, communist writings had begun to be smuggled into Nepal and two of the four great martyrs, [[Dashrath Chand|Dasharath Chand]] and [[Gangalal Shrestha]] were known to have been readers of communist literature.<ref name=jst>{{Cite journal|title=Communist Movement in Nepal|author=M.

In 1982, the party officially abandoned armed struggle as a non-viable option, opting for peaceful mass resistance instead; it also deposed Chandra Prakash Mainali, and [[Jhala Nath Khanal]] took over as general secretary.
