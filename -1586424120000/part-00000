This same exact route cannot be driven today as there have been highway progressions in several areas.\n\nThe presidential motorcade began its route without incident, stopping twice so President Kennedy could shake hands with some Catholic nuns, then some school children.\n\n[[Image:Dealey-plaza-annotated.png|thumb|upright=1.3|The route taken by the motorcade within Dealey Plaza. North is towards the almost direct-left]]\n\nAt 12:29&nbsp;p.m. CST, the presidential limousine entered [[Dealey Plaza]] after a 90-degree right turn from Main Street onto Houston Street. Over two dozen known and unknown amateur and professional still and motion-picture photographers captured the last living images of President Kennedy.\n\nJust before 12:30&nbsp;p.m. CST, President Kennedy was riding on Houston Street and slowly approached the [[Texas School Book Depository]] head-on.\n\n=== 12:30 p.m. (CST): Shots are fired ===\nAccording to witnesses, the shooting occurred shortly after the limousine made the sharp left-hand turn from Houston onto Elm Street. Most of the witnesses recalled that the first shot was fired after the president had started waving with his right hand. Several onlookers recalled hearing three shots, with the second and third shots bunched distinctly much closer together than the first and second shots. Witnesses estimate that from three to eight shots were fired.  The [[Zapruder film]] shows the President re-emerging in the footage after being temporarily hidden from view by the [[Interstate 35E (Texas)|Stemmons Freeway]] sign at Zapruder film frames 215 to 223; his mouth has already opened wide in an anguished expression by frame 225. He has already been impacted by a bullet, which hit him in the upper back and exited his throat, and his hands clench into fists. He then quickly raises his fists dramatically in front of his face and throat as he turns leftwards towards his wife. [[United States Secret Service|Secret Service]] Agent [[Clint Hill (Secret Service)|Clint Hill]] testified that he heard one shot, then jumped off the running board of the Secret Service follow-up car directly behind Kennedy (Hill was filmed jumping off his follow-up car at the equivalent of Zapruder frame 308; about a quarter of a second before the president's head exploded at frame 313). Hill then rapidly ran towards the Presidential limo and then another shot hit Kennedy in the head, cracking open the right side of his skull. As the limousine began speeding up, Mrs. Kennedy was heard to scream<ref>Before the Warren Commission, Mrs. Kennedy testified that she remembered shouting \"They've shot my husband,\" and repeating \"I love you, Jack\". [http://www.history-matters.com/archive/jfk/wc/wcvols/wh5/html/WC_Vol5_0095b.htm Warren Commission Hearings Vol. 5, p. 180], online at historymatters.com, page found April 6, 2010.</ref> and she climbed out of the back seat onto the rear of the limo. At the same time, Hill managed to climb aboard and hang onto the suddenly accelerating limo, and Mrs. Kennedy returned to the back seat. Hill then shielded her and the President. Both of the Connallys stated they heard Mrs. Kennedy say, \"I have his brains in my hand!\" The limo driver and police motorcycles turned on their sirens and raced at high speeds to [[Parkland Hospital]], passing their intended destination of the [[Dallas Trade Mart]] along the way, and arriving at about 12:38&nbsp;p.m. (CST).\n\nGovernor Connally was also struck by the shots, and his wife pulled him closer to her. He suffered several severe wounds that he survived; a bullet entry wound in his upper right back located just behind his right armpit; four inches of his right, fifth chest rib was pulverised; a two-and-a-half inch sized chest exit wound; his right arm's wrist bone was fractured into seven pieces; and he had a bullet entry wound in his left inner thigh. Although there is controversy about exactly when he was wounded, analysts from both the [[Warren Commission]] (1964) and House Select Committee on Assassinations (1979) believed that his wounds had been inflicted nearly simultaneously with President Kennedy's in their theories that the two men were struck by a single bullet. The Commission theorized both men were hit nearly simultaneously between Zapruder film frames 210 to 225, while the Committee theorized it happened at frame 190.\n\nWitness [[James Tague]] was also injured by the shots when he received a superficial face wound. The Main Street south curb he had been standing 23.5 feet away from was struck by a bullet or bullet fragment that had no copper sheath, and a fragment of the concrete curb or a bullet fragment struck Tague on his right cheek. At Zapruder frame 313 Tague's head top was located 271 feet away from and 16.4 feet below President Kennedy's head top and the limousine's front windshield and its pushed nearly vertically straight-upwards sun visors were in between the president and the impacted curb point. The bullet or bullet fragment that struck the concrete curb was never found.\n\n==Immediate aftermath==\n\n===Lee Harvey Oswald===\nDallas Patrolman Marion L. Baker had been assigned to serve as a motorcycle escort for the motorcade, and he was riding just behind the camera cars. He testified that the first shot he could hear was fired after he turned from Main St. onto Houston St. and had traveled approximately 60 to 80 feet along Houston as he approached the Houston and Elm streets intersection. Baker stated that he recognized the first shot he could hear as the report of a high-powered rifle and that he thought the shots had originated from the building \"either right in front of me [the Depository] or the one across to the right of it\" [the Dallas Textile Building (DalTex)]. He also said that he noticed pigeons take flight up from the roof of the depository building and start flying around. Baker then quickly drove to the corner of Houston and Elm St., parked his motorcycle, then looked westward into the aftermath of persons screaming, running and laying on the ground. He then listened to Chief Curry's radio broadcast saying, \"Get some men up on that railroad track\".\n\nBaker then ran to the entrance of the Texas School Book Depository, entered the building with his gun drawn, and led by building superintendent Roy Truly, made his way to the far northwest corner of the first floor. From there, Baker and Truly started yelling for someone to send an elevator down from a higher floor. When there was no response, the two men began climbing the stairs, with Truly in the lead. Approximately 90 seconds after the shots rang out, Baker stepped out onto the second floor and a movement towards the lunchroom vestibule across from the stairs caught his attention. Baker confronted Oswald at gunpoint. He let Oswald pass after Truly identified him as an employee. According to Baker, Oswald did not appear to be nervous or out of breath.<ref>Warren Commission Hearings, vol. 3, p. 263, [http://www.aarclibrary.org/publib/jfk/wc/wcvols/wh3/html/WC_Vol3_0136a.htm Testimony of Marrion L.

The rifle was reportedly discovered near the sixth-floor northwest corner by a Dallas police detective at 1:22&nbsp;p.m., having been placed down between stacks of boxes, balanced upright on the lowest edges of its barrel and wooden stock. After being discovered, the rifle was photographed before being touched and was filmed while it was being inspected by the police crime lab supervisor.\n\nEstimates of when the depository building was sealed off by police range from 12:33 to 12:50&nbsp;p.m.<ref>{{harvnb|Warren Commission|1964|pp=155\u2013156}}</ref> The Dealey Plaza immediate area streets and blocks were never sealed-off, and nine minutes after the assassination, photographs show that vehicles were still driving unhampered down Elm Street, through the crime scene kill zone.\n\nAfter leaving the depository, Oswald walked seven blocks before boarding a bus. When the bus got stuck in traffic, he got off, walked to a nearby bus station, entered a taxi, took it several blocks past his rooming house, and then walked back to the rooming house. He arrived at his rooming house at 1026 North Beckley Ave. at around 1:00&nbsp;p.m. According to his housekeeper Earlene Roberts, he left three or four minutes later. She last saw him standing and waiting at a bus stop outside the rooming house.<ref>{{cite book|url=http://www.aarclibrary.org/publib/jfk/wc/wcvols/wh6/html/WC_Vol6_0222b.htm|chapter=Testimony of Earlene Roberts|title=Investigation of the assassination of President John F.

Although authentic airchecks of KBOX's coverage from later in the day do exist and have been posted online, they do not include the moment when the station first broke the news.\n\nDown the dial, Dallas' CBS Radio affiliate [[KRLD (AM)|KRLD]] concluded the coverage of the presidential party's arrival at Love Field and switched to reporter Bob Huffaker who was standing at the corner of Main and Akard Streets in the downtown area, just 1/2 mile east of Dealey Plaza where the shooting occurred. After the president's car passed him, Huffaker continued reporting for several more minutes and was said to have been on the air as the shooting took place (although shots cannot be heard in the audio coverage). Shortly after returning to regular programming with the nationally syndicated religious program ''[[Back to the Bible|Back To The Bible]]'', the first reports of the shooting came through CBS Radio. Huffaker was not aware of the developments until he arrived back at the KRLD studio after wrapping up his coverage; he quickly drove out to Parkland Hospital to report the scene outside the hospital's emergency entrance.\n\nNBC Radio affiliate [[WBAP (AM)|WBAP]] played instrumental music, with interruptions for local bulletins, until NBC Radio's continuous coverage began.\n\nDallas' ABC television affiliate [[WFAA-TV|WFAA]] was airing a local lifestyle program, ''The Julie Benell Show'', at the time. At 12:45&nbsp;p.m. CST, the station abruptly cut from the prerecorded program to news director Jay Watson in the studio, who had been at Dealey Plaza and ran back to the station following the incident:\n\n{{quote|Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen.

Other than for two audio-only bulletins (one following the initial report), ABC did not break into its stations' programming at all, instead waiting until the network was to return to broadcasting at 2:00&nbsp;p.m. Eastern to begin its coverage.\n\nAt 1:57&nbsp;p.m. EST, just as [[Frank McGee (journalism)|Frank McGee]] joined the reporting, NBC began broadcasting the report as their camera was ready and working.<ref name=\"PhilGries\"/> Three minutes later, at 2:00 EST, CBS' camera was finally ready and Cronkite appeared on the air after a brief station break, with ABC beginning its coverage at the same time. Radio coverage was reported by Don Gardiner (ABC), [[Alan Jackson (broadcaster)|Alan Jackson]] (CBS), and (after a top-of-the-hour newscast) by [[Peter Hackes]] and [[Edwin Newman]] (NBC).\n\n==Television and radio coverage (from approx. 2:00 to 2:40 p.m. EST)==\n\n===ABC===\nProviding the reports for [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC Television]] were [[Don Goddard]], [[Ron Cochran]], and Ed Silverman in New York, [[Edward P. Morgan]] in Washington, [[Bob Clark (television reporter)|Bob Clark]] (who as noted above had been riding in the motorcade when Kennedy was shot) from Parkland Hospital, and Bill Lord from the Dallas County sheriff's office. As with the other networks, ABC interspersed with their Dallas affiliate WFAA-TV 8 for up-to-date information. Reporting from WFAA were Bob Walker (who had been at Love Field for live coverage of the President's arrival) and Jay Watson (who had remained on the air locally from the time he broke into local programming upon his return from Dealey Plaza). They were later joined by Bob Clark upon his arrival from the hospital.\n\nABC's initial coverage of the incident was very disorganized. Cochran, ABC's primary news anchor, was on his lunch break when word of the assassination attempt first broke and the network had to call him back to the studio. Silverman was the voice accompanying ABC's first bulletin, broadcast during a rerun episode of ''[[Father Knows Best]]'' that was airing on a majority of the network's affiliates in the Mountain Time Zone at the time; the surviving videotape of ABC's initial bulletins appears to have been recorded by then-affiliate [[KTVK]] in Phoenix, as it contains the interruption of ''Father Knows Best''. The first on-camera report was given by Goddard in the network's news studio, which was too far away from the teletype machines. Goddard then moved to the newsroom and was joined by the returning Cochran, and the technical crew began constructing an impromptu news set around them (ABC did not have studio space ready for such an occasion; NBC had a flash studio in its newsroom and CBS' reports came directly from their own newsroom as they had since they launched an evening newscast earlier in 1963). Cochran and Goddard were forced to stand and awkwardly hold microphones and headsets so they could report the information.\n\nIn addition to the disorganization in New York, ABC was not able to switch to Dallas to speak to its correspondents. Only one feed was available to them at first, which came from the Dallas Trade Mart and CBS affiliate KRLD reporter Eddie Barker. CBS had earlier aired snippets of Barker's report, but had cut it off to return to its own reporting of the incident before Barker finished; ABC aired the remainder of the report until the end. The reason that ABC was able to air the CBS affiliate's coverage was due to a pool arrangement the three major Dallas stations agreed to for the President's visit. [[KXAS|WBAP]] was responsible for covering the President's visit to Fort Worth and his departure and landing at Love Field, WFAA was assigned to cover the parade through downtown Dallas, and KRLD was set up at the Dallas Trade Mart for the address the President was to give.\n\nAt 2:25&nbsp;p.m. EST, while attempting to switch to Bob Clark in Dallas, ABC Radio reported that Parkland Hospital said President Kennedy was dead, and then stressed that it was unconfirmed. Upon reporting the news, anchor Don Gardiner said this to his audience:\n\n{{quote|Ladies and gentlemen, this is a moment trying for all of us. Let us pause, and let us all pray.}}\n\nABC Radio then stopped coverage to broadcast orchestral music.<ref>http://www.radiotapes.com/JFK/ABC_JFK_03.mp3</ref>\n\nAt 2:33&nbsp;p.m. EST, Cochran reported on ABC Television that the two priests who were called into the hospital to administer the last rites to the President said that he had died from his wounds. Although this was an unconfirmed report, ABC prematurely placed a photo of the President with the words \"JOHN F. KENNEDY \u2013 1917\u20131963\" on the screen.\n\nFive minutes later, this photo was again prematurely placed when Cochran received an erroneous report that the President had died at 1:35&nbsp;p.m. CST when, in fact, he had died at 1:00&nbsp;p.m. CST. A few minutes following that, Cochran received further information regarding the President's condition and relayed the following to the ABC viewing audience:\n\n{{quote|Government sources now confirm...we have this from Washington. Government sources now confirm that President Kennedy is dead.  So that, apparently, is the final word and an incredible event that I am sure no one except the assassin himself could have possibly imagined would occur on this day.}}\n\nOn ABC Radio, Gardiner reported the news, but did not say whether or not it was official.  ABC then switched to Pete Clapper on Capitol Hill for an interview with the Senate's press liaison Richard Reidel. Moments later, the interview was interrupted by Gardiner's report of the President's death:\n\n{{quote|Ladies and gentlemen, the President of the United States, John Fitzgerald Kennedy, is dead. The President is dead. Let us pray.}}\n\nABC Radio then returned to orchestral music.\n\n===CBS===\nAt 2:00&nbsp;p.m. EST, CBS took an extended station identification break so the affiliates in the Mountain and Pacific time zones could join the rest of the network in covering the story. Cronkite, now at his desk in the newsroom, appeared on camera for the first time and, for the sake of any new viewers who might not have been aware of what was happening, told the audience of the attempt made on the President's life.\n\nFrom the time the CBS affiliates joined Cronkite in the news room at the top of the hour to approximately 2:38&nbsp;p.m. EST, the coverage alternated from the CBS Newsroom and Cronkite, to KRLD-TV's Eddie Barker at the Dallas Trade Mart where President Kennedy was to give his luncheon address.\n\nAt approximately 2:11&nbsp;p.m. EST, CBS News correspondent [[Dan Rather]] telephoned one of the two priests who performed last rites on Kennedy to confirm that he had indeed been shot. \"Yes, he's been shot and he is dead,\" the priest told Rather. Almost simultaneously at the Trade Mart, a doctor went up to Barker and whispered, \"Eddie, he is dead... I called the emergency room and he is DOA.\" Moments later, as the news cameras panned throughout the Trade Mart crowds, Barker gave this report:\n\n{{quote|As you can imagine, there are many stories that are coming in now as to the actual condition of the President. One is that he is dead; this cannot be confirmed. Another is that Governor Connally is in the operating room; this we have not confirmed.}}\n\nSeveral minutes later, when CBS switched back to KRLD and the Trade Mart for another report, Barker repeated the claim of the President's death, adding \"the source would normally be a good one.\" During this report, as Barker was speaking of security precautions for the President's visit, a Trade Mart employee was shown removing the Presidential seal from the podium where President Kennedy was to have spoken.\n\n====CBS Radio's death announcement====\nAt 2:19&nbsp;p.m. EST, CBS Dallas correspondents Dan Rather and Eddie Barker spoke by telephone to \"compare notes, to take stock\". Rather was aware that there was an open line to New York as the two of them spoke, but \"didn't realize how many people were ''on'' that phone line\", which included at least three individuals from CBS Radio.<ref name=\":1\">{{Citation|last=|title=JFK: News of a Shooting (television documentary)|date=|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkiBRcdH_Pc&t=3508|accessdate=May 24, 2018}}</ref> Rather, who had \"no doubt in his mind\" that Kennedy was dead, nevertheless was not delivering ''official'' word to CBS Radio, nor was he aware that his discussion with Barker would be construed as such. As Rather spoke to Barker, an individual from CBS Radio asked, \"Did you say the president is dead?\" Rather replied, \"Yes.\"<ref name=\":1\" /> Based on the call, CBS Radio newsroom supervisor Robert Skedgell wrote \"JFK DEAD\" on a slip of paper and handed it to CBS Radio news anchor [[Alan Jackson (broadcaster)|Allan Jackson]]. At 2:22&nbsp;p.m. EST, eleven minutes before Kilduff's official announcement, Jackson made the following announcement:\n\n{{quote|Ladies and gentlemen, the president of the United States is dead.

At 2:27&nbsp;p.m. EST, they decided to give Rather's report to Cronkite, who relayed this to the nation:\n\n{{quote|We just have a report from our correspondent Dan Rather in Dallas that he has confirmed that President Kennedy is dead.  There is still no official confirmation of this. However, it's a report from our correspondent, Dan Rather, in Dallas, Texas.}}\n\nApproximately five minutes after this, one of the newsroom staff members rushed to Cronkite's desk with another bulletin. As Cronkite read the bulletin, he had to re-read it as he stumbled over his words.\n\n{{quote|The priest... who were with Kennedy... the two priests who were with Kennedy say that he is dead of his bullet wounds. That seems to be about as close to official as we can get at this time.}}\n\nAlthough Cronkite continued to stress that there was no official confirmation, the tone of Cronkite's words seemed to indicate that it would only be a matter of time before the official word came. Three minutes later, he received the same report that ABC's Ron Cochran chose to relay as official word. Cronkite did not do the same, reporting it instead in this context:\n\n{{quote|And now, from Washington, government sources say that President Kennedy is dead. Those are government sources, still not an official announcement.}}\n\nCronkite continued as before while still awaiting word of the official confirmation of the President's death, which at this time had been relayed by Kilduff at the hospital two minutes prior but had not made the press wires yet. After speaking about what Kennedy had done earlier that day in Fort Worth, Cronkite noted that the plane from Fort Worth flew the President to his \"rendezvous with ''death, apparently'', in Dallas\", although the official bulletin still had not arrived yet.\n\nImmediately after that, at 2:38&nbsp;p.m. EST, Cronkite remarked on fearful concerns of demonstrations in Dallas similar to the attack of U.N. Ambassador [[Adlai Stevenson II|Adlai Stevenson]] in Dallas the previous month. At that moment, a CBS News employee seen in the background pulled off a sheet from the AP News ticker. He quickly relayed it (off-camera) to Cronkite, who put on his glasses, took a few seconds to read the sheet, and made the announcement:\n\n{{quote|From Dallas, Texas, the flash, apparently official: ''[reading [[Associated Press|AP]] flash]'' 'PRESIDENT KENNEDY DIED AT 1 P.M. (CST),'<ref name=\"Associated Press 1963 page=15\"/><ref name=\"Associated Press 2007 Page 383\">{{harvnb|Associated Press|2007|p=383}}</ref> 2:00 Eastern Standard Time, some thirty-eight minutes ago.}}\n\nAfter reading the flash, Cronkite took off his glasses so he could consult the studio clock, which established the lapse in time since Kennedy had died. He paused briefly and replaced his eyeglasses, visibly moved for a moment. Cronkite continued:\n\n{{quote|Vice President Johnson... ''(clears throat)'' ...has left the hospital in Dallas, but we do not know to where he has proceeded. Presumably, he will be taking the oath of office shortly and become the thirty-sixth president of the United States.}}\n\nThere was a sense of irony to CBS' coverage of the assassination. On September 2, 1963, Kennedy gave an interview with Cronkite, helping CBS inaugurate network television's first half hour evening newscast.<ref>{{cite book|last=Cronkite|first=Walter|title=A Reporter's Life|location=New York|publisher=Alfred A. Knopf|year=1996|isbn=0-394-57879-1}}</ref>\n\nIt should perhaps be noted that CBS did not include any further coverage from Dallas or Washington as the other networks had until after the announcement of Kennedy's death. As coverage continued following the announcement, [[Charles Collingwood (journalist)|Charles Collingwood]] relieved Cronkite in New York while Neil Strawser reported from CBS' Washington bureau and Dan Rather and Eddie Barker provided reports from KRLD in Dallas.\n\n===NBC===\nAt NBC-TV, [[Chet Huntley]], [[Bill Ryan (journalist)|Bill Ryan]], and [[Frank McGee (journalist)|Frank McGee]] anchored from the network's emergency \"flash\" studio (code name 5HN) in New York, with reports from [[David Brinkley]] in Washington, Charles Murphy and Tom Whelan from NBC affiliate WBAP-TV (now KXAS-TV) in Fort Worth, Texas, and [[Robert MacNeil]], who had been in the motorcade, at [[Parkland Hospital]].<ref>{{harvnb|NBC News|1966|pp=13\u201315}}</ref> [[Edwin Newman]] reported from NBC Radio with periodic simulcast with NBC-TV. NBC Radio's coverage was simulcast in Canada by [[CBC Radio One|CBC Radio]].<ref>Ahluwalia, Raj (2002). ''We Interrupt This Program''. Toronto: Winding Stair Press. p. 52.</ref> Also, the United States' international shortwave broadcaster, [[Voice of America]], relayed portions of NBC's coverage (including the simulcast with the television coverage) as part of its English-language coverage of the tragic news. (A short aircheck of VOA exists in which the announcers on duty attempt to make sense of the conflicting reports about Kennedy's condition, and then the station briefly simulcasts NBC before heading into Polish language programming at 1:00&nbsp;p.m. Central Time.)\n\nThroughout the first 35 minutes, there were technical difficulties with the Fort Worth TV relay as well as with the phone link MacNeil was using to report from the hospital.<ref name=\"TenBells\">{{cite news|title=Ten Bells Signaled Moment in History|agency=Associated Press|date=November 17, 1988|first=Alan|last=Robinson}}</ref> When the coverage began, McGee was waiting for MacNeil to call in with information. While Ryan and Huntley were recounting the information, McGee got MacNeil on the line and told him to recount chronologically what happened.<ref name=\"NBC News 1966 page=14\">{{harvnb|NBC News|1966|p=14}}</ref> However, NBC was using a studio that wasn't equipped to patch calls through to the air and thus only McGee could hear MacNeil.<ref name=\"TenBells\"/> While the studio crew worked on a solution, McGee improvised and told MacNeil to relay the information in fragments, which he would then repeat for the audience. While they were talking, Huntley was handed a speaker from off camera and took the receiver from McGee so he could attach it to the earpiece, this enabling MacNeil to be heard. However, by that time there was no further information to report; MacNeil had a medical student from Parkland hold the phone line for him so that he could return to the emergency ward for the latest developments. He would return briefly several minutes later to offer more word on the condition of the President, during which the phone link temporarily worked, but as MacNeil left again the relay cut out. Before he left, he informed McGee that a press conference regarding Kennedy's condition was forthcoming.<ref name=\"NBC News 1966 page=14\"/>\n\nAt approximately 2:35&nbsp;p.m. EST, shortly after Ryan reported that a neurosurgeon had just arrived at Parkland to assist in treating Kennedy. Huntley alluded to the last time a president had died in office:\n\n{{quote|In just this momentary lull, I would assume that the memory of every person listening at this moment has flashed back to that day in April 1945 when Franklin Delano Roosevelt{{nbsp}}...}}\n\nHe was unable to complete his thought, however. The flash regarding the priests who administered the Last Rites to the President had reached the desk while Huntley was speaking and Ryan interrupted him to relay this:<ref name=\"NBC News Page 16\">{{harvnb|NBC News|1966|p=16}}</ref>\n\n{{quote|Excuse me, Chet. Here is a flash from the Associated Press, dateline Dallas: 'Two priests who were with President Kennedy say he is dead of bullet wounds.'<ref name=\"Associated Press 2007 Page 383\"/> There is no further confirmation, but this is what we have on a flash basis from the Associated Press: 'Two priests in Dallas who were with President Kennedy say he is dead of bullet wounds.' There is no further confirmation. This is the only word we have indicating that the president may, in fact, have lost his life.  It has just moved on the Associated Press wires from Dallas.  The two priests were called to the hospital to administer the last rites of the Roman Catholic Church. And it is from them, we get the word, that the president has died, that the bullet wounds inflicted on him as he rode in a motorcade through downtown Dallas have been fatal. We will remind you that there is no official confirmation of this from any source as yet.}}\n\nAs this was going on, McGee received a report from Parkland Hospital. Shortly after arriving at the hospital, Vice President Johnson had been advised to begin heading back to Washington to assume executive duties in case he needed to be sworn in. Johnson decided to wait until he received word of Kennedy's condition, which he did at approximately 1:20 PM CST.<ref name=\"MillerPage315\"/><ref name=\"Johnson-Page11\"/> McGee reported to Ryan that a motorcade carrying the Johnsons had just left Parkland Hospital, which Ryan took to be confirmation of the President's death as the priests had reported.\n\nOn NBC Radio and CBC Radio, Newman reported the same flash, having received it about half a minute after Ryan:\n\n{{quote|Here is a flash from Dallas: 'Two priests who were with President Kennedy say he is dead of bullet wounds suffered in the assassination attempt today.' I repeat, a flash from Dallas: 'Two priests who were with President Kennedy say he is dead of bullet wounds.' This is the latest information we have from Dallas. We are, of course, standing by to give you all available information as it comes to us. I will repeat, with the greatest regret, this flash: 'Two priests who were with President Kennedy say he has died of bullet wounds.'<ref>http://www.radiotapes.com/JFK/NBC_Radio_JFK_News_%20Coverage_5.mp3</ref>}}\n\nAt that point, both radio networks rejoined NBC-TV where Ryan reported that there may in fact be confirmation of the priests' account of Kennedy's death. The feed then switched back to Charles Murphy at WBAP-TV, who reported that although no official statement had been released by the President's staff, the Dallas Police Department had been notified of Kennedy's death and radioed the word to every officer on duty shortly before the flash from Dallas made the wires.<ref name=\"NBC News Page 16\"/>\n\nAs Murphy was filing his report, McGee got back in touch with Robert MacNeil, who had just returned from the aforementioned press conference. Partway through the report, the audio link was fixed and MacNeil could be heard clearly in studio and on air. McGee was unaware of this, as he simply carried on as he had been:<ref name=\"NBC News Page 16\"/>\n\n{{quote|White House (Acting) Press Secretary... Malcolm Kilduff... has just announced that President Kennedy... died at approximately 1:00 Central Standard Time, which is about 35 minutes ago... (''audio enabled'') ...after being shot at (after being shot)... by an unknown assailant (by an unknown assailant) ...during a motorcade drive through downtown Dallas (during a motorcade drive through downtown Dallas).}}\n\nAfter MacNeil finished giving all the relevant information available, he left the phone to obtain further information. McGee, wiping a tear from his eye, stood by and kept the phone line open for MacNeil's next update.\n\n===KLIF Radio, Dallas===\nFrom local radio station [[KLIF (AM)|KLIF]], Gary Delaune relayed the bulletins as received with reports from Joe Long from KLIF News Mobile Unit #4. Long, who had reported the President's arrival at Love Field earlier, later joined Delaune in the studio; Roy Nichols took over the #4 mobile unit and headed for Parkland Hospital. After a report from the Trade Mart, radio broadcaster and KLIF founder [[Gordon McLendon]] returned to the radio station to relieve Delaune. The reporters continuously stressed, as a strict radio station rule of McLendon's, whether the information received is from official or unofficial sources, especially concerning reports of the President's death. At approximately 1:38&nbsp;p.m. CST, KLIF's Teletype sounded ten bells (indicating an incoming bulletin of utmost importance) and Long was given the official flash:\n\n{{quote|Gordon McLendon: The President is clearly, gravely, critically, and perhaps fatally wounded. There are strong indications that he may already have expired, although that is not official, we repeat, not official. But, the extent of the injuries to Governor Connally is, uh, a closely shrouded secret at the moment...\n\nJoe Long: President Kennedy is dead, Gordon. This is official word.\n\nGordon McLendon: Ladies and gentlemen, the President is dead. The President, ladies and gentlemen, is dead at Parkland Hospital in Dallas.}}\n\nKLIF's continuous coverage would eventually be aired over an ad-hoc radio network of its own, as the station's coverage was fed to KLIF's sister stations in Houston, Louisville, and other cities and reportedly aired (with or without permission) on dozens, possibly hundreds, of others.\n\nFollowing the official announcement of President Kennedy's death, all three commercial networks suspended their regular programming and commercials for the first time in the short history of television and ran coverage on a non-stop basis for four days.<ref>{{harvnb|White|1965|pp=5-6, 12-13}}</ref> The assassination of President Kennedy was the longest uninterrupted news event in the history of American television until just before 9:00&nbsp;a.m. EDT, September 11, 2001, when the networks were on the air for 72 hours straight covering the [[September 11 attacks|9/11 terrorist attacks]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Viewers Again Return To Traditional Networks|date=September 15, 2001|first=Bill|last=Carter|first2=Jim|last2=Rutenberg|newspaper=New York Times|page=A14|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/09/15/us/after-the-attacks-television-viewers-again-return-to-traditional-networks.html?pagewanted=print|quote=Sometime around 9 a.m. yesterday a television milestone was reached: three broadcast networks had covered one news event for more consecutive hours than any previous event in American history.

The original schedule was for the president to proceed in a long motorcade from [[Dallas Love Field|Love Field]] through downtown Dallas, and end at the Dallas Business and Trade Mart.\n\nThe motorcade was scheduled to enter [[Dealey Plaza]] at 12:10&nbsp;p.m., followed by a 12:15&nbsp;p.m. arrival at the Trade Mart, where President Kennedy was scheduled to deliver a speech and share a steak luncheon with local government, business, religious, and civic leaders and their spouses. Invitations that were sent out specify a noon start time to the luncheon while SS agent Lawson told Chief Curry that after arriving at Love Field and leaving at 11:30 the 38- to 45-minute trip would get them to the Trade Mart on time. Air Force One touched down at 11:39&nbsp;a.m. and the Presidential motorcade did not leave Love Field until approximately fifteen minutes later.\n\nDallas/Fort Worth's television stations were given separate assignments. As Bob Walker of [[WFAA]]-TV 8 (ABC) was providing live coverage of the President's arrival at Love Field, [[KDFW|KRLD-TV]] 4 (CBS) with [[Eddie Barker]] was set up at the Trade Mart for Kennedy's luncheon speech.

This same exact route cannot be driven today as there have been highway progressions in several areas.\n\nThe presidential motorcade began its route without incident, stopping twice so President Kennedy could shake hands with some Catholic nuns, then some school children.\n\n[[Image:Dealey-plaza-annotated.png|thumb|upright=1.3|The route taken by the motorcade within Dealey Plaza. North is towards the almost direct-left]]\n\nAt 12:29&nbsp;p.m. CST, the presidential limousine entered [[Dealey Plaza]] after a 90-degree right turn from Main Street onto Houston Street. Over two dozen known and unknown amateur and professional still and motion-picture photographers captured the last living images of President Kennedy.\n\nJust before 12:30&nbsp;p.m. CST, President Kennedy was riding on Houston Street and slowly approached the [[Texas School Book Depository]] head-on.\n\n=== 12:30 p.m. (CST): Shots are fired ===\nAccording to witnesses, the shooting occurred shortly after the limousine made the sharp left-hand turn from Houston onto Elm Street. Most of the witnesses recalled that the first shot was fired after the president had started waving with his right hand. Several onlookers recalled hearing three shots, with the second and third shots bunched distinctly much closer together than the first and second shots. Witnesses estimate that from three to eight shots were fired.  The [[Zapruder film]] shows the President re-emerging in the footage after being temporarily hidden from view by the [[Interstate 35E (Texas)|Stemmons Freeway]] sign at Zapruder film frames 215 to 223; his mouth has already opened wide in an anguished expression by frame 225. He has already been impacted by a bullet, which hit him in the upper back and exited his throat, and his hands clench into fists. He then quickly raises his fists dramatically in front of his face and throat as he turns leftwards towards his wife. [[United States Secret Service|Secret Service]] Agent [[Clint Hill (Secret Service)|Clint Hill]] testified that he heard one shot, then jumped off the running board of the Secret Service follow-up car directly behind Kennedy (Hill was filmed jumping off his follow-up car at the equivalent of Zapruder frame 308; about a quarter of a second before the president's head exploded at frame 313). Hill then rapidly ran towards the Presidential limo and then another shot hit Kennedy in the head, cracking open the right side of his skull. As the limousine began speeding up, Mrs. Kennedy was heard to scream<ref>Before the Warren Commission, Mrs. Kennedy testified that she remembered shouting \"They've shot my husband,\" and repeating \"I love you, Jack\". [http://www.history-matters.com/archive/jfk/wc/wcvols/wh5/html/WC_Vol5_0095b.htm Warren Commission Hearings Vol. 5, p. 180], online at historymatters.com, page found April 6, 2010.</ref> and she climbed out of the back seat onto the rear of the limo. At the same time, Hill managed to climb aboard and hang onto the suddenly accelerating limo, and Mrs. Kennedy returned to the back seat. Hill then shielded her and the President. Both of the Connallys stated they heard Mrs. Kennedy say, \"I have his brains in my hand!\" The limo driver and police motorcycles turned on their sirens and raced at high speeds to [[Parkland Hospital]], passing their intended destination of the [[Dallas Trade Mart]] along the way, and arriving at about 12:38&nbsp;p.m. (CST).\n\nGovernor Connally was also struck by the shots, and his wife pulled him closer to her. He suffered several severe wounds that he survived; a bullet entry wound in his upper right back located just behind his right armpit; four inches of his right, fifth chest rib was pulverised; a two-and-a-half inch sized chest exit wound; his right arm's wrist bone was fractured into seven pieces; and he had a bullet entry wound in his left inner thigh. Although there is controversy about exactly when he was wounded, analysts from both the [[Warren Commission]] (1964) and House Select Committee on Assassinations (1979) believed that his wounds had been inflicted nearly simultaneously with President Kennedy's in their theories that the two men were struck by a single bullet. The Commission theorized both men were hit nearly simultaneously between Zapruder film frames 210 to 225, while the Committee theorized it happened at frame 190.\n\nWitness [[James Tague]] was also injured by the shots when he received a superficial face wound. The Main Street south curb he had been standing 23.5 feet away from was struck by a bullet or bullet fragment that had no copper sheath, and a fragment of the concrete curb or a bullet fragment struck Tague on his right cheek. At Zapruder frame 313 Tague's head top was located 271 feet away from and 16.4 feet below President Kennedy's head top and the limousine's front windshield and its pushed nearly vertically straight-upwards sun visors were in between the president and the impacted curb point. The bullet or bullet fragment that struck the concrete curb was never found.\n\n==Immediate aftermath==\n\n===Lee Harvey Oswald===\nDallas Patrolman Marion L. Baker had been assigned to serve as a motorcycle escort for the motorcade, and he was riding just behind the camera cars. He testified that the first shot he could hear was fired after he turned from Main St. onto Houston St. and had traveled approximately 60 to 80 feet along Houston as he approached the Houston and Elm streets intersection. Baker stated that he recognized the first shot he could hear as the report of a high-powered rifle and that he thought the shots had originated from the building \"either right in front of me [the Depository] or the one across to the right of it\" [the Dallas Textile Building (DalTex)]. He also said that he noticed pigeons take flight up from the roof of the depository building and start flying around. Baker then quickly drove to the corner of Houston and Elm St., parked his motorcycle, then looked westward into the aftermath of persons screaming, running and laying on the ground. He then listened to Chief Curry's radio broadcast saying, \"Get some men up on that railroad track\".\n\nBaker then ran to the entrance of the Texas School Book Depository, entered the building with his gun drawn, and led by building superintendent Roy Truly, made his way to the far northwest corner of the first floor. From there, Baker and Truly started yelling for someone to send an elevator down from a higher floor. When there was no response, the two men began climbing the stairs, with Truly in the lead. Approximately 90 seconds after the shots rang out, Baker stepped out onto the second floor and a movement towards the lunchroom vestibule across from the stairs caught his attention. Baker confronted Oswald at gunpoint. He let Oswald pass after Truly identified him as an employee. According to Baker, Oswald did not appear to be nervous or out of breath.<ref>Warren Commission Hearings, vol. 3, p. 263, [http://www.aarclibrary.org/publib/jfk/wc/wcvols/wh3/html/WC_Vol3_0136a.htm Testimony of Marrion L.

The rifle was reportedly discovered near the sixth-floor northwest corner by a Dallas police detective at 1:22&nbsp;p.m., having been placed down between stacks of boxes, balanced upright on the lowest edges of its barrel and wooden stock. After being discovered, the rifle was photographed before being touched and was filmed while it was being inspected by the police crime lab supervisor.\n\nEstimates of when the depository building was sealed off by police range from 12:33 to 12:50&nbsp;p.m.<ref>{{harvnb|Warren Commission|1964|pp=155\u2013156}}</ref> The Dealey Plaza immediate area streets and blocks were never sealed-off, and nine minutes after the assassination, photographs show that vehicles were still driving unhampered down Elm Street, through the crime scene kill zone.\n\nAfter leaving the depository, Oswald walked seven blocks before boarding a bus. When the bus got stuck in traffic, he got off, walked to a nearby bus station, entered a taxi, took it several blocks past his rooming house, and then walked back to the rooming house. He arrived at his rooming house at 1026 North Beckley Ave. at around 1:00&nbsp;p.m. According to his housekeeper Earlene Roberts, he left three or four minutes later. She last saw him standing and waiting at a bus stop outside the rooming house.<ref>{{cite book|url=http://www.aarclibrary.org/publib/jfk/wc/wcvols/wh6/html/WC_Vol6_0222b.htm|chapter=Testimony of Earlene Roberts|title=Investigation of the assassination of President John F.

The song was stopped and newscaster Gary Delaune made the first announcement over the bulletin signal:\n\n{{quote|This KLIF Bulletin, from Dallas: Three shots reportedly were fired at the motorcade of President Kennedy today near the downtown section.  KLIF News is checking out the report. We will have further reports. Stay tuned.}}\n\nKLIF's competitor Top 40 station, [[KNGO|KBOX]], has been widely cited as the only station to report the shooting as it happened, but the \"aircheck\" of this moment widely circulated in the decades since \u2013 in which newsman [[Sam Pate]] breathlessly reports, \"It appears as though something has happened in the motorcade route{{nbsp}}...\" \u2013 is in fact a recreation. Although authentic airchecks of KBOX's coverage from later in the day do exist and have been posted online, they do not include the moment when the station first broke the news.\n\nDown the dial, Dallas' CBS Radio affiliate [[KRLD (AM)|KRLD]] concluded the coverage of the presidential party's arrival at Love Field and switched to reporter Bob Huffaker who was standing at the corner of Main and Akard Streets in the downtown area, just 1/2 mile east of Dealey Plaza where the shooting occurred. After the president's car passed him, Huffaker continued reporting for several more minutes and was said to have been on the air as the shooting took place (although shots cannot be heard in the audio coverage). Shortly after returning to regular programming with the nationally syndicated religious program ''[[Back to the Bible|Back To The Bible]]'', the first reports of the shooting came through CBS Radio. Huffaker was not aware of the developments until he arrived back at the KRLD studio after wrapping up his coverage; he quickly drove out to Parkland Hospital to report the scene outside the hospital's emergency entrance.\n\nNBC Radio affiliate [[WBAP (AM)|WBAP]] played instrumental music, with interruptions for local bulletins, until NBC Radio's continuous coverage began.\n\nDallas' ABC television affiliate [[WFAA-TV|WFAA]] was airing a local lifestyle program, ''The Julie Benell Show'', at the time. At 12:45&nbsp;p.m. CST, the station abruptly cut from the prerecorded program to news director Jay Watson in the studio, who had been at Dealey Plaza and ran back to the station following the incident:\n\n{{quote|Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen.

They were riding in an open automobile when the shots were fired.'<ref>{{harvnb|United Press International|''American Heritage'' Magazine|1964|p=23}}</ref>}}\n\nWatson then began anchoring continuous coverage of the tragedy with Jerry Haynes, better known as WFAA-TV children's TV show host \"Mr. Peppermint,\" followed shortly by an interview with witnesses Bill and Gayle Newman.\n\n===Nationally===\nThe first national news bulletin of the shooting came over the [[ABC Radio Network]] at 12:36&nbsp;p.m. CST/1:36&nbsp;p.m. EST.<ref name=\"ABC\">{{harvnb|Trost|Bennett|2003|p=34}}</ref> The most complete recording of the initial ABC bulletins came from [[WNYW (shortwave)|WRUL]], a New York-based station transmitting to Latin America and Europe on [[shortwave]], which was featuring a program of [[middle of the road (music)|MOR]] album music when the shooting took place. At the time, [[Doris Day]]'s recording of \"[[Hooray for Hollywood (song)|Hooray for Hollywood]]\" was playing when newscaster Don Gardiner broke in with the developments:\n\n{{quote|We interrupt this program to bring you a special bulletin from ABC Radio.

Now, we return you to your regular program.<ref name=\"ABC\"/>}}\n\nFour minutes following ABC's radio bulletin, CBS was the first to break the news over television at 12:40&nbsp;p.m. CST/1:40&nbsp;p.m. EST. The network interrupted its live production broadcast of ''[[As the World Turns]]'' with a \"CBS News Bulletin\" bumper slide and [[Walter Cronkite]], reporting from the CBS Radio flash booth, filed an audio-only report. Live video of Cronkite was impossible at that time, as no camera in the CBS newsroom (which used [[Video camera tube#Image orthicon|image orthicon tubes]] and took approximately 20 minutes to warm up<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YjYPWFfnL74C&pg=PA43&lpg=PA43|title=Principles of Fluoroscopic Image Intensification and Television Systems: Workbook and Laboratory Manual|last=Parelli|first=Robert J.|date=November 21, 1996|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=9781574440829|language=en}}</ref>) was ready:\n\n{{quote|Here is a bulletin from CBS News: 'in Dallas, Texas, three shots were fired at President Kennedy's motorcade in downtown Dallas.'

Stay tuned to CBS News for further details.}}\n\nInitially, the live broadcast of ''As the World Turns'' continued, with the actors unaware of the earlier pre-emption for the bulletin. Cronkite later filed two additional audio-only bulletins to interrupt programming, the last of which interrupted a [[Friskies]] dog food commercial and pre-empted the remaining running time of ''As the World Turns''. Only the bulletin bumper remained on screen while a television camera warmed up, until 2:00&nbsp;p.m. EST. Cronkite stated in a later interview that this event was responsible for a new CBS network policy of always having a hot camera available to the newsroom to avoid this difficulty in the future.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0311/21/asb.00.html|title=CNN Newsnight Aaron Brown transcript|last=|first=|date=November 21, 2003|website=transcripts.cnn.com|access-date=May 24, 2018}}</ref>\n\nAt that time, ''As the World Turns'' was the runaway top-rated daytime show, and [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] and [[NBC]] made no concerted effort to compete with CBS in the time slot; as a result, the other television networks weren't on the air in the Eastern and Central Time Zones. Various programs were being broadcast through their affiliate stations.<ref name=\"TenBells\"/> From their main headquarters in New York, [[WABC-TV]]'s first bulletin came from Ed Silverman at 1:42&nbsp;p.m. EST, interrupting reruns of ''[[The Ann Sothern Show]]'' on the East Coast and ''[[Father Knows Best]]'' in the Mountain Time Zone.  ABC-TV was not feeding programming to its affiliates in the Pacific Time Zone at that hour.  At the same time of ABC-TV's first bulletin, NBC Radio reported the first of three \"Hotline Bulletins\", each preceded by a \"talk-up alert\" which gave all NBC-affiliated stations 30 seconds to join their parent network.  Three minutes later, [[Don Pardo]] broke into [[WNBC-TV]]'s local rerun of ''[[Bachelor Father (US TV series)|Bachelor Father]]'' with the news, saying (reading AP bulletin) 'PRESIDENT KENNEDY WAS SHOT TODAY JUST AS HIS MOTORCADE LEFT DOWNTOWN DALLAS. MRS. KENNEDY JUMPED UP AND GRABBED MR. KENNEDY. SHE CRIED 'OH NO!'

Other than for two audio-only bulletins (one following the initial report), ABC did not break into its stations' programming at all, instead waiting until the network was to return to broadcasting at 2:00&nbsp;p.m. Eastern to begin its coverage.\n\nAt 1:57&nbsp;p.m. EST, just as [[Frank McGee (journalism)|Frank McGee]] joined the reporting, NBC began broadcasting the report as their camera was ready and working.<ref name=\"PhilGries\"/> Three minutes later, at 2:00 EST, CBS' camera was finally ready and Cronkite appeared on the air after a brief station break, with ABC beginning its coverage at the same time. Radio coverage was reported by Don Gardiner (ABC), [[Alan Jackson (broadcaster)|Alan Jackson]] (CBS), and (after a top-of-the-hour newscast) by [[Peter Hackes]] and [[Edwin Newman]] (NBC).\n\n==Television and radio coverage (from approx. 2:00 to 2:40 p.m. EST)==\n\n===ABC===\nProviding the reports for [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC Television]] were [[Don Goddard]], [[Ron Cochran]], and Ed Silverman in New York, [[Edward P. Morgan]] in Washington, [[Bob Clark (television reporter)|Bob Clark]] (who as noted above had been riding in the motorcade when Kennedy was shot) from Parkland Hospital, and Bill Lord from the Dallas County sheriff's office. As with the other networks, ABC interspersed with their Dallas affiliate WFAA-TV 8 for up-to-date information. Reporting from WFAA were Bob Walker (who had been at Love Field for live coverage of the President's arrival) and Jay Watson (who had remained on the air locally from the time he broke into local programming upon his return from Dealey Plaza). They were later joined by Bob Clark upon his arrival from the hospital.\n\nABC's initial coverage of the incident was very disorganized. Cochran, ABC's primary news anchor, was on his lunch break when word of the assassination attempt first broke and the network had to call him back to the studio. Silverman was the voice accompanying ABC's first bulletin, broadcast during a rerun episode of ''[[Father Knows Best]]'' that was airing on a majority of the network's affiliates in the Mountain Time Zone at the time; the surviving videotape of ABC's initial bulletins appears to have been recorded by then-affiliate [[KTVK]] in Phoenix, as it contains the interruption of ''Father Knows Best''. The first on-camera report was given by Goddard in the network's news studio, which was too far away from the teletype machines. Goddard then moved to the newsroom and was joined by the returning Cochran, and the technical crew began constructing an impromptu news set around them (ABC did not have studio space ready for such an occasion; NBC had a flash studio in its newsroom and CBS' reports came directly from their own newsroom as they had since they launched an evening newscast earlier in 1963). Cochran and Goddard were forced to stand and awkwardly hold microphones and headsets so they could report the information.\n\nIn addition to the disorganization in New York, ABC was not able to switch to Dallas to speak to its correspondents. Only one feed was available to them at first, which came from the Dallas Trade Mart and CBS affiliate KRLD reporter Eddie Barker. CBS had earlier aired snippets of Barker's report, but had cut it off to return to its own reporting of the incident before Barker finished; ABC aired the remainder of the report until the end. The reason that ABC was able to air the CBS affiliate's coverage was due to a pool arrangement the three major Dallas stations agreed to for the President's visit. [[KXAS|WBAP]] was responsible for covering the President's visit to Fort Worth and his departure and landing at Love Field, WFAA was assigned to cover the parade through downtown Dallas, and KRLD was set up at the Dallas Trade Mart for the address the President was to give.\n\nAt 2:25&nbsp;p.m. EST, while attempting to switch to Bob Clark in Dallas, ABC Radio reported that Parkland Hospital said President Kennedy was dead, and then stressed that it was unconfirmed. Upon reporting the news, anchor Don Gardiner said this to his audience:\n\n{{quote|Ladies and gentlemen, this is a moment trying for all of us. Let us pause, and let us all pray.}}\n\nABC Radio then stopped coverage to broadcast orchestral music.<ref>http://www.radiotapes.com/JFK/ABC_JFK_03.mp3</ref>\n\nAt 2:33&nbsp;p.m. EST, Cochran reported on ABC Television that the two priests who were called into the hospital to administer the last rites to the President said that he had died from his wounds. Although this was an unconfirmed report, ABC prematurely placed a photo of the President with the words \"JOHN F. KENNEDY \u2013 1917\u20131963\" on the screen.\n\nFive minutes later, this photo was again prematurely placed when Cochran received an erroneous report that the President had died at 1:35&nbsp;p.m. CST when, in fact, he had died at 1:00&nbsp;p.m. CST. A few minutes following that, Cochran received further information regarding the President's condition and relayed the following to the ABC viewing audience:\n\n{{quote|Government sources now confirm...we have this from Washington. Government sources now confirm that President Kennedy is dead.  So that, apparently, is the final word and an incredible event that I am sure no one except the assassin himself could have possibly imagined would occur on this day.}}\n\nOn ABC Radio, Gardiner reported the news, but did not say whether or not it was official.  ABC then switched to Pete Clapper on Capitol Hill for an interview with the Senate's press liaison Richard Reidel. Moments later, the interview was interrupted by Gardiner's report of the President's death:\n\n{{quote|Ladies and gentlemen, the President of the United States, John Fitzgerald Kennedy, is dead. The President is dead. Let us pray.}}\n\nABC Radio then returned to orchestral music.\n\n===CBS===\nAt 2:00&nbsp;p.m. EST, CBS took an extended station identification break so the affiliates in the Mountain and Pacific time zones could join the rest of the network in covering the story. Cronkite, now at his desk in the newsroom, appeared on camera for the first time and, for the sake of any new viewers who might not have been aware of what was happening, told the audience of the attempt made on the President's life.\n\nFrom the time the CBS affiliates joined Cronkite in the news room at the top of the hour to approximately 2:38&nbsp;p.m. EST, the coverage alternated from the CBS Newsroom and Cronkite, to KRLD-TV's Eddie Barker at the Dallas Trade Mart where President Kennedy was to give his luncheon address.\n\nAt approximately 2:11&nbsp;p.m. EST, CBS News correspondent [[Dan Rather]] telephoned one of the two priests who performed last rites on Kennedy to confirm that he had indeed been shot. \"Yes, he's been shot and he is dead,\" the priest told Rather. Almost simultaneously at the Trade Mart, a doctor went up to Barker and whispered, \"Eddie, he is dead... I called the emergency room and he is DOA.\" Moments later, as the news cameras panned throughout the Trade Mart crowds, Barker gave this report:\n\n{{quote|As you can imagine, there are many stories that are coming in now as to the actual condition of the President. One is that he is dead; this cannot be confirmed. Another is that Governor Connally is in the operating room; this we have not confirmed.}}\n\nSeveral minutes later, when CBS switched back to KRLD and the Trade Mart for another report, Barker repeated the claim of the President's death, adding \"the source would normally be a good one.\" During this report, as Barker was speaking of security precautions for the President's visit, a Trade Mart employee was shown removing the Presidential seal from the podium where President Kennedy was to have spoken.\n\n====CBS Radio's death announcement====\nAt 2:19&nbsp;p.m. EST, CBS Dallas correspondents Dan Rather and Eddie Barker spoke by telephone to \"compare notes, to take stock\". Rather was aware that there was an open line to New York as the two of them spoke, but \"didn't realize how many people were ''on'' that phone line\", which included at least three individuals from CBS Radio.<ref name=\":1\">{{Citation|last=|title=JFK: News of a Shooting (television documentary)|date=|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkiBRcdH_Pc&t=3508|accessdate=May 24, 2018}}</ref> Rather, who had \"no doubt in his mind\" that Kennedy was dead, nevertheless was not delivering ''official'' word to CBS Radio, nor was he aware that his discussion with Barker would be construed as such. As Rather spoke to Barker, an individual from CBS Radio asked, \"Did you say the president is dead?\" Rather replied, \"Yes.\"<ref name=\":1\" /> Based on the call, CBS Radio newsroom supervisor Robert Skedgell wrote \"JFK DEAD\" on a slip of paper and handed it to CBS Radio news anchor [[Alan Jackson (broadcaster)|Allan Jackson]]. At 2:22&nbsp;p.m. EST, eleven minutes before Kilduff's official announcement, Jackson made the following announcement:\n\n{{quote|Ladies and gentlemen, the president of the United States is dead.

At 2:27&nbsp;p.m. EST, they decided to give Rather's report to Cronkite, who relayed this to the nation:\n\n{{quote|We just have a report from our correspondent Dan Rather in Dallas that he has confirmed that President Kennedy is dead.  There is still no official confirmation of this. However, it's a report from our correspondent, Dan Rather, in Dallas, Texas.}}\n\nApproximately five minutes after this, one of the newsroom staff members rushed to Cronkite's desk with another bulletin. As Cronkite read the bulletin, he had to re-read it as he stumbled over his words.\n\n{{quote|The priest... who were with Kennedy... the two priests who were with Kennedy say that he is dead of his bullet wounds. That seems to be about as close to official as we can get at this time.}}\n\nAlthough Cronkite continued to stress that there was no official confirmation, the tone of Cronkite's words seemed to indicate that it would only be a matter of time before the official word came. Three minutes later, he received the same report that ABC's Ron Cochran chose to relay as official word. Cronkite did not do the same, reporting it instead in this context:\n\n{{quote|And now, from Washington, government sources say that President Kennedy is dead. Those are government sources, still not an official announcement.}}\n\nCronkite continued as before while still awaiting word of the official confirmation of the President's death, which at this time had been relayed by Kilduff at the hospital two minutes prior but had not made the press wires yet. After speaking about what Kennedy had done earlier that day in Fort Worth, Cronkite noted that the plane from Fort Worth flew the President to his \"rendezvous with ''death, apparently'', in Dallas\", although the official bulletin still had not arrived yet.\n\nImmediately after that, at 2:38&nbsp;p.m. EST, Cronkite remarked on fearful concerns of demonstrations in Dallas similar to the attack of U.N. Ambassador [[Adlai Stevenson II|Adlai Stevenson]] in Dallas the previous month. At that moment, a CBS News employee seen in the background pulled off a sheet from the AP News ticker. He quickly relayed it (off-camera) to Cronkite, who put on his glasses, took a few seconds to read the sheet, and made the announcement:\n\n{{quote|From Dallas, Texas, the flash, apparently official: ''[reading [[Associated Press|AP]] flash]'' 'PRESIDENT KENNEDY DIED AT 1 P.M. (CST),'<ref name=\"Associated Press 1963 page=15\"/><ref name=\"Associated Press 2007 Page 383\">{{harvnb|Associated Press|2007|p=383}}</ref> 2:00 Eastern Standard Time, some thirty-eight minutes ago.}}\n\nAfter reading the flash, Cronkite took off his glasses so he could consult the studio clock, which established the lapse in time since Kennedy had died. He paused briefly and replaced his eyeglasses, visibly moved for a moment. Cronkite continued:\n\n{{quote|Vice President Johnson... ''(clears throat)'' ...has left the hospital in Dallas, but we do not know to where he has proceeded. Presumably, he will be taking the oath of office shortly and become the thirty-sixth president of the United States.}}\n\nThere was a sense of irony to CBS' coverage of the assassination. On September 2, 1963, Kennedy gave an interview with Cronkite, helping CBS inaugurate network television's first half hour evening newscast.<ref>{{cite book|last=Cronkite|first=Walter|title=A Reporter's Life|location=New York|publisher=Alfred A. Knopf|year=1996|isbn=0-394-57879-1}}</ref>\n\nIt should perhaps be noted that CBS did not include any further coverage from Dallas or Washington as the other networks had until after the announcement of Kennedy's death. As coverage continued following the announcement, [[Charles Collingwood (journalist)|Charles Collingwood]] relieved Cronkite in New York while Neil Strawser reported from CBS' Washington bureau and Dan Rather and Eddie Barker provided reports from KRLD in Dallas.\n\n===NBC===\nAt NBC-TV, [[Chet Huntley]], [[Bill Ryan (journalist)|Bill Ryan]], and [[Frank McGee (journalist)|Frank McGee]] anchored from the network's emergency \"flash\" studio (code name 5HN) in New York, with reports from [[David Brinkley]] in Washington, Charles Murphy and Tom Whelan from NBC affiliate WBAP-TV (now KXAS-TV) in Fort Worth, Texas, and [[Robert MacNeil]], who had been in the motorcade, at [[Parkland Hospital]].<ref>{{harvnb|NBC News|1966|pp=13\u201315}}</ref> [[Edwin Newman]] reported from NBC Radio with periodic simulcast with NBC-TV. NBC Radio's coverage was simulcast in Canada by [[CBC Radio One|CBC Radio]].<ref>Ahluwalia, Raj (2002). ''We Interrupt This Program''. Toronto: Winding Stair Press. p. 52.</ref> Also, the United States' international shortwave broadcaster, [[Voice of America]], relayed portions of NBC's coverage (including the simulcast with the television coverage) as part of its English-language coverage of the tragic news. (A short aircheck of VOA exists in which the announcers on duty attempt to make sense of the conflicting reports about Kennedy's condition, and then the station briefly simulcasts NBC before heading into Polish language programming at 1:00&nbsp;p.m. Central Time.)\n\nThroughout the first 35 minutes, there were technical difficulties with the Fort Worth TV relay as well as with the phone link MacNeil was using to report from the hospital.<ref name=\"TenBells\">{{cite news|title=Ten Bells Signaled Moment in History|agency=Associated Press|date=November 17, 1988|first=Alan|last=Robinson}}</ref> When the coverage began, McGee was waiting for MacNeil to call in with information. While Ryan and Huntley were recounting the information, McGee got MacNeil on the line and told him to recount chronologically what happened.<ref name=\"NBC News 1966 page=14\">{{harvnb|NBC News|1966|p=14}}</ref> However, NBC was using a studio that wasn't equipped to patch calls through to the air and thus only McGee could hear MacNeil.<ref name=\"TenBells\"/> While the studio crew worked on a solution, McGee improvised and told MacNeil to relay the information in fragments, which he would then repeat for the audience. While they were talking, Huntley was handed a speaker from off camera and took the receiver from McGee so he could attach it to the earpiece, this enabling MacNeil to be heard. However, by that time there was no further information to report; MacNeil had a medical student from Parkland hold the phone line for him so that he could return to the emergency ward for the latest developments. He would return briefly several minutes later to offer more word on the condition of the President, during which the phone link temporarily worked, but as MacNeil left again the relay cut out. Before he left, he informed McGee that a press conference regarding Kennedy's condition was forthcoming.<ref name=\"NBC News 1966 page=14\"/>\n\nAt approximately 2:35&nbsp;p.m. EST, shortly after Ryan reported that a neurosurgeon had just arrived at Parkland to assist in treating Kennedy. Huntley alluded to the last time a president had died in office:\n\n{{quote|In just this momentary lull, I would assume that the memory of every person listening at this moment has flashed back to that day in April 1945 when Franklin Delano Roosevelt{{nbsp}}...}}\n\nHe was unable to complete his thought, however. The flash regarding the priests who administered the Last Rites to the President had reached the desk while Huntley was speaking and Ryan interrupted him to relay this:<ref name=\"NBC News Page 16\">{{harvnb|NBC News|1966|p=16}}</ref>\n\n{{quote|Excuse me, Chet. Here is a flash from the Associated Press, dateline Dallas: 'Two priests who were with President Kennedy say he is dead of bullet wounds.'<ref name=\"Associated Press 2007 Page 383\"/> There is no further confirmation, but this is what we have on a flash basis from the Associated Press: 'Two priests in Dallas who were with President Kennedy say he is dead of bullet wounds.' There is no further confirmation. This is the only word we have indicating that the president may, in fact, have lost his life.  It has just moved on the Associated Press wires from Dallas.  The two priests were called to the hospital to administer the last rites of the Roman Catholic Church. And it is from them, we get the word, that the president has died, that the bullet wounds inflicted on him as he rode in a motorcade through downtown Dallas have been fatal. We will remind you that there is no official confirmation of this from any source as yet.}}\n\nAs this was going on, McGee received a report from Parkland Hospital. Shortly after arriving at the hospital, Vice President Johnson had been advised to begin heading back to Washington to assume executive duties in case he needed to be sworn in. Johnson decided to wait until he received word of Kennedy's condition, which he did at approximately 1:20 PM CST.<ref name=\"MillerPage315\"/><ref name=\"Johnson-Page11\"/> McGee reported to Ryan that a motorcade carrying the Johnsons had just left Parkland Hospital, which Ryan took to be confirmation of the President's death as the priests had reported.\n\nOn NBC Radio and CBC Radio, Newman reported the same flash, having received it about half a minute after Ryan:\n\n{{quote|Here is a flash from Dallas: 'Two priests who were with President Kennedy say he is dead of bullet wounds suffered in the assassination attempt today.' I repeat, a flash from Dallas: 'Two priests who were with President Kennedy say he is dead of bullet wounds.' This is the latest information we have from Dallas. We are, of course, standing by to give you all available information as it comes to us. I will repeat, with the greatest regret, this flash: 'Two priests who were with President Kennedy say he has died of bullet wounds.'<ref>http://www.radiotapes.com/JFK/NBC_Radio_JFK_News_%20Coverage_5.mp3</ref>}}\n\nAt that point, both radio networks rejoined NBC-TV where Ryan reported that there may in fact be confirmation of the priests' account of Kennedy's death. The feed then switched back to Charles Murphy at WBAP-TV, who reported that although no official statement had been released by the President's staff, the Dallas Police Department had been notified of Kennedy's death and radioed the word to every officer on duty shortly before the flash from Dallas made the wires.<ref name=\"NBC News Page 16\"/>\n\nAs Murphy was filing his report, McGee got back in touch with Robert MacNeil, who had just returned from the aforementioned press conference. Partway through the report, the audio link was fixed and MacNeil could be heard clearly in studio and on air. McGee was unaware of this, as he simply carried on as he had been:<ref name=\"NBC News Page 16\"/>\n\n{{quote|White House (Acting) Press Secretary... Malcolm Kilduff... has just announced that President Kennedy... died at approximately 1:00 Central Standard Time, which is about 35 minutes ago... (''audio enabled'') ...after being shot at (after being shot)... by an unknown assailant (by an unknown assailant) ...during a motorcade drive through downtown Dallas (during a motorcade drive through downtown Dallas).}}\n\nAfter MacNeil finished giving all the relevant information available, he left the phone to obtain further information. McGee, wiping a tear from his eye, stood by and kept the phone line open for MacNeil's next update.\n\n===KLIF Radio, Dallas===\nFrom local radio station [[KLIF (AM)|KLIF]], Gary Delaune relayed the bulletins as received with reports from Joe Long from KLIF News Mobile Unit #4. Long, who had reported the President's arrival at Love Field earlier, later joined Delaune in the studio; Roy Nichols took over the #4 mobile unit and headed for Parkland Hospital. After a report from the Trade Mart, radio broadcaster and KLIF founder [[Gordon McLendon]] returned to the radio station to relieve Delaune. The reporters continuously stressed, as a strict radio station rule of McLendon's, whether the information received is from official or unofficial sources, especially concerning reports of the President's death. At approximately 1:38&nbsp;p.m. CST, KLIF's Teletype sounded ten bells (indicating an incoming bulletin of utmost importance) and Long was given the official flash:\n\n{{quote|Gordon McLendon: The President is clearly, gravely, critically, and perhaps fatally wounded. There are strong indications that he may already have expired, although that is not official, we repeat, not official. But, the extent of the injuries to Governor Connally is, uh, a closely shrouded secret at the moment...\n\nJoe Long: President Kennedy is dead, Gordon. This is official word.\n\nGordon McLendon: Ladies and gentlemen, the President is dead. The President, ladies and gentlemen, is dead at Parkland Hospital in Dallas.}}\n\nKLIF's continuous coverage would eventually be aired over an ad-hoc radio network of its own, as the station's coverage was fed to KLIF's sister stations in Houston, Louisville, and other cities and reportedly aired (with or without permission) on dozens, possibly hundreds, of others.\n\nFollowing the official announcement of President Kennedy's death, all three commercial networks suspended their regular programming and commercials for the first time in the short history of television and ran coverage on a non-stop basis for four days.<ref>{{harvnb|White|1965|pp=5-6, 12-13}}</ref> The assassination of President Kennedy was the longest uninterrupted news event in the history of American television until just before 9:00&nbsp;a.m. EDT, September 11, 2001, when the networks were on the air for 72 hours straight covering the [[September 11 attacks|9/11 terrorist attacks]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Viewers Again Return To Traditional Networks|date=September 15, 2001|first=Bill|last=Carter|first2=Jim|last2=Rutenberg|newspaper=New York Times|page=A14|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/09/15/us/after-the-attacks-television-viewers-again-return-to-traditional-networks.html?pagewanted=print|quote=Sometime around 9 a.m. yesterday a television milestone was reached: three broadcast networks had covered one news event for more consecutive hours than any previous event in American history.

He attended English independent (or [[Public school (United Kingdom)|public]]) schools and studied English at [[Christ Church, Oxford]]. After a few months in Berlin in 1928\u201329, he spent five years (1930\u201335) teaching in British public schools, then travelled to Iceland and China in order to write books about his journeys.\n\nIn 1939 he moved to the United States and became an [[Citizenship of the United States|American citizen]] in 1946, retaining his British citizenship. He taught from 1941 to 1945 in American universities, followed by occasional visiting professorships in the 1950s. From 1947 to 1957 he wintered in New York and summered in [[Ischia]]; from 1958 until the end of his life he wintered in New York (in Oxford in 1972\u201373) and summered in [[Kirchstetten]], Lower Austria.\n\nHe came to wide public attention with his first book ''[[Poems (Auden)|Poems]]'' at the age of twenty-three in 1930; it was followed in 1932 by ''[[The Orators]]''. Three plays written in collaboration with [[Christopher Isherwood]] between 1935 and 1938 built his reputation as a left-wing political writer. Auden moved to the United States partly to escape this reputation, and his work in the 1940s, including the long poems \"[[For the Time Being]]\" and \"[[The Sea and the Mirror]]\", focused on religious themes. He won the [[Pulitzer Prize for Poetry]] for his 1947 long poem ''[[The Age of Anxiety]]'', the title of which became a popular phrase describing the modern era.<ref name=\"RDH-NoPage\"/> From 1956 to 1961 he was [[Oxford Professor of Poetry|Professor of Poetry at Oxford]]; his lectures were popular with students and faculty, and served as the basis for his 1962 prose collection ''[[The Dyer's Hand]]''.\n\nAuden and Isherwood maintained a lasting but intermittent sexual friendship from around 1927 to 1939, while both had briefer but more intense relations with other men.<ref name=\"RDH-NoPage\"/> In 1939, Auden fell in love with [[Chester Kallman]] and regarded their relationship as a marriage, but this ended in 1941 when Kallman refused to accept the faithful relations that Auden demanded. However, the two maintained their friendship, and from 1947 until Auden's death they lived in the same house or apartment in a non-sexual relationship, often collaborating on opera libretti such as that of ''[[The Rake's Progress]]'', to music by [[Igor Stravinsky]].\n\nAuden was a prolific writer of prose essays and reviews on literary, political, psychological, and religious subjects, and he worked at various times on documentary films, poetic plays, and other forms of performance.

Twenty of these poems appeared in his first book ''[[Poems (Auden)|Poems]]'' (1928), a pamphlet hand-printed by [[Stephen Spender]].<ref>{{cite book\n| last = Auden\n| first = W.

This mixture of tragedy and farce, with a dream play-within-a-play, introduced the mixed styles and content of much of his later work.<ref name=\"FullerNoPage\"/> This drama and thirty short poems appeared in his first published book ''[[Poems (Auden)|Poems]]'' (1930, 2nd edition with seven poems replaced, 1933); the poems in the book were mostly lyrical and gnomic mediations on hoped-for or unconsummated love and on themes of personal, social, and seasonal renewal; among these poems were \"It was Easter as I walked,\" \"Doom is dark,\" \"Sir, no man's enemy,\" and \"This lunar beauty.\"<ref name=\"EarlyNoPage\"/>\n\nA recurrent theme in these early poems is the effect of \"family ghosts\", Auden's term for the powerful, unseen psychological effects of preceding generations on any individual life (and the title of a poem). A parallel theme, present throughout his work, is the contrast between biological evolution (unchosen and involuntary) and the psychological evolution of cultures and individuals (voluntary and deliberate even in its subconscious aspects).<ref name=\"FullerNoPage\"/><ref name=\"EarlyNoPage\"/>\n\n====1931\u201335====\n[[File:DanceOfDeathProgramme.jpg|thumb|Programme of a Group Theatre production of ''[[The Dance of Death (Auden)|The Dance of Death]]'', with unsigned synopsis by Auden]]\n\nAuden's next large-scale work was ''[[The Orators]]: An English Study'' (1932; revised editions, 1934, 1966), in verse and prose, largely about hero-worship in personal and political life. In his shorter poems, his style became more open and accessible, and the exuberant \"Six Odes\" in ''The Orators'' reflect his new interest in [[Robert Burns]].<ref name=\"FullerNoPage\"/> During the next few years, many of his poems took their form and style from traditional ballads and popular songs, and also from expansive classical forms like the ''[[Odes (Horace)|Odes]]'' of [[Horace]], which he seems to have discovered through the German poet [[H\u00f6lderlin]].<ref name=\"EarlyNoPage\"/> Around this time his main influences were [[Dante]], [[William Langland]], and [[Alexander Pope]].<ref>{{cite book\n| last = Auden\n| first = W.

''[[Journey to a War]]'' (1939) a travel book in prose and verse, was written with Isherwood after their visit to the [[Second Sino-Japanese War|Sino-Japanese War]].<ref name=\"ProseOne\"/> Auden's last collaboration with Isherwood was their third play, ''[[On the Frontier]]'', an anti-war satire written in Broadway and West End styles.<ref name=\"EarlyNoPage\"/><ref name=\"DNB\"/>\n\nAuden's shorter poems now engaged with the fragility and transience of personal love (\"Danse Macabre\", \"The Dream\", \"Lay your sleeping head\"), a subject he treated with ironic wit in his \"Four Cabaret Songs for Miss [[Hedli Anderson]]\" (which included \"Tell Me the Truth About Love\" and the revised version of \"[[Funeral Blues]]\"), and also the corrupting effect of public and official culture on individual lives (\"Casino\", \"School Children\", \"Dover\").<ref name=\"FullerNoPage\"/><ref name=\"EarlyNoPage\"/> In 1938 he wrote a series of dark, ironic ballads about individual failure (\"Miss Gee\", \"James Honeyman\", \"Victor\"). All these appeared in ''[[Another Time (book)|Another Time]]'' (1940), together with poems including \"Dover\", \"As He Is\", and \"[[Mus\u00e9e des Beaux Arts (poem)|Mus\u00e9e des Beaux Arts]]\" (all of which were written before he moved to America in 1939), and \"In Memory of W. B. Yeats\", \"[[The Unknown Citizen]]\", \"Law Like Love\", \"September 1, 1939\", and \"In Memory of Sigmund Freud\" (all written in America).<ref name=\"FullerNoPage\"/>\n\nThe elegies for Yeats and Freud are partly anti-heroic statements, in which great deeds are performed, not by unique geniuses whom others cannot hope to imitate, but by otherwise ordinary individuals who were \"silly like us\" (Yeats) or of whom it could be said \"he wasn't clever at all\" (Freud), and who became teachers of others, not awe-inspiring heroes.<ref name=\"EarlyNoPage\"/>\n\n===Middle period, 1940\u20131957===\n====1940\u20131946====\nIn 1940 Auden wrote a long philosophical poem \"New Year Letter\", which appeared with miscellaneous notes and other poems in ''[[The Double Man (book)|The Double Man]]'' (1941). At the time of his return to the Anglican Communion he began writing abstract verse on theological themes, such as \"Canzone\" and \"Kairos and Logos\". Around 1942, as he became more comfortable with religious themes, his verse became more open and relaxed, and he increasingly used the [[syllabic verse]] he had learned from the poetry of [[Marianne Moore]].<ref name=\"LaterNoPage\"/>\n\nAuden's work in this era addresses the artist's temptation to use other persons as material for his art rather than valuing them for themselves (\"Prospero to Ariel\") and the corresponding moral obligation to make and keep commitments while recognising the temptation to break them (\"In Sickness and Health\").<ref name=\"LaterNoPage\"/><ref name=\"FullerNoPage\"/> From 1942 through 1947 he worked mostly on three long poems in dramatic form, each differing from the others in form and content: \"[[For the Time Being|For the Time Being: A Christmas Oratorio]]\", \"[[The Sea and the Mirror|The Sea and the Mirror: A Commentary on Shakespeare's ''The Tempest'']]\" (both published in ''For the Time Being'', 1944), and ''[[The Age of Anxiety|The Age of Anxiety: A Baroque Eclogue]]'' (published separately in 1947).<ref name=\"LaterNoPage\"/> The first two, with Auden's other new poems from 1940 to 1944, were included in his first collected edition, ''The Collected Poetry of W.&nbsp;H.

While writing this, he also wrote \"[[Bucolics (Auden)|Bucolics]],\" a sequence of seven poems about man's relation to nature.

Auden's poetry was noted for its stylistic and technical achievement, its engagement with politics, morals, love, and religion, and its variety in tone, form and content. Some of his best known poems are about love, such as \"[[Funeral Blues]]\"; on political and social themes, such as \"[[September 1, 1939]]\" and \"[[The Shield of Achilles]]\"; on cultural and psychological themes, such as ''[[The Age of Anxiety]]''; and on religious themes such as \"[[For the Time Being]]\" and \"[[Horae Canonicae]]\".<ref>{{cite book\n| last = Auden\n| first = W.&nbsp;H.\n| editor-first = Edward\n| editor-last = Mendelson\n| editor-link=Edward Mendelson\n| title = Prose, Volume II: 1939\u20131948\n| publisher = [[Princeton University Press]]\n| location = Princeton\n| year = 2002\n| page = 478\n| isbn = 978-0-691-08935-5}} Auden used the phrase \"Anglo-American Poets\" in 1943, implicitly referring to himself and [[T.

He attended English independent (or [[Public school (United Kingdom)|public]]) schools and studied English at [[Christ Church, Oxford]]. After a few months in Berlin in 1928\u201329, he spent five years (1930\u201335) teaching in British public schools, then travelled to Iceland and China in order to write books about his journeys.\n\nIn 1939 he moved to the United States and became an [[Citizenship of the United States|American citizen]] in 1946, retaining his British citizenship. He taught from 1941 to 1945 in American universities, followed by occasional visiting professorships in the 1950s. From 1947 to 1957 he wintered in New York and summered in [[Ischia]]; from 1958 until the end of his life he wintered in New York (in Oxford in 1972\u201373) and summered in [[Kirchstetten]], Lower Austria.\n\nHe came to wide public attention with his first book ''[[Poems (Auden)|Poems]]'' at the age of twenty-three in 1930; it was followed in 1932 by ''[[The Orators]]''. Three plays written in collaboration with [[Christopher Isherwood]] between 1935 and 1938 built his reputation as a left-wing political writer. Auden moved to the United States partly to escape this reputation, and his work in the 1940s, including the long poems \"[[For the Time Being]]\" and \"[[The Sea and the Mirror]]\", focused on religious themes. He won the [[Pulitzer Prize for Poetry]] for his 1947 long poem ''[[The Age of Anxiety]]'', the title of which became a popular phrase describing the modern era.<ref name=\"RDH-NoPage\"/> From 1956 to 1961 he was [[Oxford Professor of Poetry|Professor of Poetry at Oxford]]; his lectures were popular with students and faculty, and served as the basis for his 1962 prose collection ''[[The Dyer's Hand]]''.\n\nAuden and Isherwood maintained a lasting but intermittent sexual friendship from around 1927 to 1939, while both had briefer but more intense relations with other men.<ref name=\"RDH-NoPage\"/> In 1939, Auden fell in love with [[Chester Kallman]] and regarded their relationship as a marriage, but this ended in 1941 when Kallman refused to accept the faithful relations that Auden demanded. However, the two maintained their friendship, and from 1947 until Auden's death they lived in the same house or apartment in a non-sexual relationship, often collaborating on opera libretti such as that of ''[[The Rake's Progress]]'', to music by [[Igor Stravinsky]].\n\nAuden was a prolific writer of prose essays and reviews on literary, political, psychological, and religious subjects, and he worked at various times on documentary films, poetic plays, and other forms of performance. Throughout his career he was both controversial and influential, and critical views on his work ranged from sharply dismissive\u2014treating him as a lesser figure than [[W. B. Yeats]] and [[T. S. Eliot]]\u2014to strongly affirmative, as in [[Joseph Brodsky]]'s statement that he had \"the greatest mind of the twentieth century\". After his death, his poems became known to a much wider public than during his lifetime through films, broadcasts, and popular media.\n\n==Life==\n===Childhood===\n[[File:54 Bootham York 4.jpg|upright|thumb|Auden's birthplace in York]]\n\nAuden was born in [[York]], England, to [[George Augustus Auden]] (1872\u20131957), a physician, and Constance Rosalie Auden (n\u00e9e Bicknell; 1869\u20131941), who had trained (but never served) as a missionary nurse.<ref>Carpenter, ''W.

Friends he met at Oxford include [[Cecil Day-Lewis]], [[Louis MacNeice]], and [[Stephen Spender]]; these four were commonly though misleadingly identified in the 1930s as the \"[[Auden Group]]\" for their shared (but not identical) left-wing views.

In groups he was often dogmatic and overbearing in a comic way; in more private settings he was diffident and shy except when certain of his welcome. He was punctual in his habits, and obsessive about meeting deadlines, while choosing to live amidst physical disorder.<ref name=\"RDH-NoPage\"/>\n\n===Britain and Europe, 1928\u20131938===\nIn late 1928, Auden left Britain for nine months, going to [[Berlin]], partly to rebel against English repressiveness. In Berlin, he first experienced the political and economic unrest that became one of his central subjects.<ref name=\"DNB\"/>\n\nOn returning to Britain in 1929, he worked briefly as a tutor. In 1930 his first published book, ''Poems'' (1930), was accepted by [[T. S. Eliot]] for [[Faber and Faber]], and the same firm remained the British publisher of all the books he published thereafter. In 1930 he began five years as a schoolmaster in boys' schools: two years at the [[Larchfield Academy]] in [[Helensburgh]], Scotland, then three years at [[The Downs School (Herefordshire)|the Downs School]] in the [[Malvern Hills]], where he was a much-loved teacher.<ref name=\"CarpenterNoPage\"/> At the Downs, in June 1933, he experienced what he later described as a \"Vision of [[Agape]]\", while sitting with three fellow-teachers at the school, when he suddenly found that he loved them for themselves, that their existence had infinite value for him; this experience, he said, later influenced his decision to return to the Anglican Church in 1940.<ref>{{cite book\n | first=W.

His relationships (and his unsuccessful courtships) tended to be unequal either in age or intelligence; his sexual relations were transient, although some evolved into long friendships.

Auden spent late 1938 partly in England, partly in [[Brussels]].<ref name=\"CarpenterNoPage\"/>\n\nMany of Auden's poems during the 1930s and after were inspired by unconsummated love, and in the 1950s he summarised his emotional life in a famous couplet: \"If equal affection cannot be / Let the more loving one be me\" (\"The More Loving One\"). He had a gift for friendship and, starting in the late 1930s, a strong wish for the stability of marriage; in a letter to his friend [[James Stern (writer)|James Stern]] he called marriage \"the ''only'' subject.\"<ref>{{cite book| first=W.

At eighteen he discovered [[T. S. Eliot|T.&nbsp;S. Eliot]] and adopted an extreme version of Eliot's style. He found his own voice at twenty when he wrote the first poem later included in his collected work, \"From the very first coming down\".<ref name=\"EarlyNoPage\"/> This and other poems of the late 1920s tended to be in a clipped, elusive style that alluded to, but did not directly state, their themes of loneliness and loss. Twenty of these poems appeared in his first book ''[[Poems (Auden)|Poems]]'' (1928), a pamphlet hand-printed by [[Stephen Spender]].<ref>{{cite book\n| last = Auden\n| first = W.

This mixture of tragedy and farce, with a dream play-within-a-play, introduced the mixed styles and content of much of his later work.<ref name=\"FullerNoPage\"/> This drama and thirty short poems appeared in his first published book ''[[Poems (Auden)|Poems]]'' (1930, 2nd edition with seven poems replaced, 1933); the poems in the book were mostly lyrical and gnomic mediations on hoped-for or unconsummated love and on themes of personal, social, and seasonal renewal; among these poems were \"It was Easter as I walked,\" \"Doom is dark,\" \"Sir, no man's enemy,\" and \"This lunar beauty.\"<ref name=\"EarlyNoPage\"/>\n\nA recurrent theme in these early poems is the effect of \"family ghosts\", Auden's term for the powerful, unseen psychological effects of preceding generations on any individual life (and the title of a poem). A parallel theme, present throughout his work, is the contrast between biological evolution (unchosen and involuntary) and the psychological evolution of cultures and individuals (voluntary and deliberate even in its subconscious aspects).<ref name=\"FullerNoPage\"/><ref name=\"EarlyNoPage\"/>\n\n====1931\u201335====\n[[File:DanceOfDeathProgramme.jpg|thumb|Programme of a Group Theatre production of ''[[The Dance of Death (Auden)|The Dance of Death]]'', with unsigned synopsis by Auden]]\n\nAuden's next large-scale work was ''[[The Orators]]: An English Study'' (1932; revised editions, 1934, 1966), in verse and prose, largely about hero-worship in personal and political life. In his shorter poems, his style became more open and accessible, and the exuberant \"Six Odes\" in ''The Orators'' reflect his new interest in [[Robert Burns]].<ref name=\"FullerNoPage\"/> During the next few years, many of his poems took their form and style from traditional ballads and popular songs, and also from expansive classical forms like the ''[[Odes (Horace)|Odes]]'' of [[Horace]], which he seems to have discovered through the German poet [[H\u00f6lderlin]].<ref name=\"EarlyNoPage\"/> Around this time his main influences were [[Dante]], [[William Langland]], and [[Alexander Pope]].<ref>{{cite book\n| last = Auden\n| first = W.

''[[Journey to a War]]'' (1939) a travel book in prose and verse, was written with Isherwood after their visit to the [[Second Sino-Japanese War|Sino-Japanese War]].<ref name=\"ProseOne\"/> Auden's last collaboration with Isherwood was their third play, ''[[On the Frontier]]'', an anti-war satire written in Broadway and West End styles.<ref name=\"EarlyNoPage\"/><ref name=\"DNB\"/>\n\nAuden's shorter poems now engaged with the fragility and transience of personal love (\"Danse Macabre\", \"The Dream\", \"Lay your sleeping head\"), a subject he treated with ironic wit in his \"Four Cabaret Songs for Miss [[Hedli Anderson]]\" (which included \"Tell Me the Truth About Love\" and the revised version of \"[[Funeral Blues]]\"), and also the corrupting effect of public and official culture on individual lives (\"Casino\", \"School Children\", \"Dover\").<ref name=\"FullerNoPage\"/><ref name=\"EarlyNoPage\"/> In 1938 he wrote a series of dark, ironic ballads about individual failure (\"Miss Gee\", \"James Honeyman\", \"Victor\").

B. Yeats\", \"[[The Unknown Citizen]]\", \"Law Like Love\", \"September 1, 1939\", and \"In Memory of Sigmund Freud\" (all written in America).<ref name=\"FullerNoPage\"/>\n\nThe elegies for Yeats and Freud are partly anti-heroic statements, in which great deeds are performed, not by unique geniuses whom others cannot hope to imitate, but by otherwise ordinary individuals who were \"silly like us\" (Yeats) or of whom it could be said \"he wasn't clever at all\" (Freud), and who became teachers of others, not awe-inspiring heroes.<ref name=\"EarlyNoPage\"/>\n\n===Middle period, 1940\u20131957===\n====1940\u20131946====\nIn 1940 Auden wrote a long philosophical poem \"New Year Letter\", which appeared with miscellaneous notes and other poems in ''[[The Double Man (book)|The Double Man]]'' (1941). At the time of his return to the Anglican Communion he began writing abstract verse on theological themes, such as \"Canzone\" and \"Kairos and Logos\". Around 1942, as he became more comfortable with religious themes, his verse became more open and relaxed, and he increasingly used the [[syllabic verse]] he had learned from the poetry of [[Marianne Moore]].<ref name=\"LaterNoPage\"/>\n\nAuden's work in this era addresses the artist's temptation to use other persons as material for his art rather than valuing them for themselves (\"Prospero to Ariel\") and the corresponding moral obligation to make and keep commitments while recognising the temptation to break them (\"In Sickness and Health\").<ref name=\"LaterNoPage\"/><ref name=\"FullerNoPage\"/> From 1942 through 1947 he worked mostly on three long poems in dramatic form, each differing from the others in form and content: \"[[For the Time Being|For the Time Being: A Christmas Oratorio]]\", \"[[The Sea and the Mirror|The Sea and the Mirror: A Commentary on Shakespeare's ''The Tempest'']]\" (both published in ''For the Time Being'', 1944), and ''[[The Age of Anxiety|The Age of Anxiety: A Baroque Eclogue]]'' (published separately in 1947).<ref name=\"LaterNoPage\"/> The first two, with Auden's other new poems from 1940 to 1944, were included in his first collected edition, ''The Collected Poetry of W.&nbsp;H.

They are managed by the [[Spanish Basketball Federation]], the governing body for [[basketball in Spain]].\n\nSpain has appeared 32 times at the [[EuroBasket]], winning three gold medals, six silver medals, and four bronze medals. They have also competed at the [[Basketball at the Summer Olympics|Summer Olympics]] 12 times, with three silver medals and one bronze medal as their accomplishments. They have qualified for the [[FIBA World Cup]] 12 times, winning it all twice, in [[2006 FIBA World Championship|2006]] and [[2019 FIBA Basketball World Cup|2019]].\n\nSpain is currently ranked 2nd in the [[FIBA World Rankings]], only behind the [[United States men's national basketball team|United States]].<ref>[http://www.fiba.com/pages/eng/fc/even/rank/p/rankMen.html FIBA.com \u2013 FIBA World Ranking for men<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\n==History==\n===Olympic Games===\nWhen Spain qualified for the [[Basketball at the 1936 Summer Olympics|1936 Summer Olympics]], where basketball was part of the games for the first time, expectations were high for the runner-up of the [[1935 EuroBasket]]. Unfortunately, as one of the favorites to win medals, Spain could not attend the Games because of the outbreak of the [[Spanish Civil War]] just days before the start of the Games.\n\nBefore the Spanish national team won the gold medal in the 2006 FIBA World Cup (see below), their greatest international success was reaching the final in the [[Basketball at the 1984 Summer Olympics|1984 Summer Olympics Basketball Tournament]] which took place in Los Angeles. The other finalist was the [[United States men's national basketball team|USA national team]] (led by [[Patrick Ewing]] and featuring a young [[Michael Jordan]]), which won the final and with it the gold medal. Spain, thus, took the Olympic silver medal.\n\nContinuing the success started at the 2006 FIBA World Cup, Spain again reached the final at the [[Basketball at the 2008 Summer Olympics \u2013 Men's tournament|2008 Summer Olympics]]. This proved to be a rematch of the 1984 Olympic final; this time, the USA team was led by [[Kobe Bryant]] and nicknamed the \"[[2008 United States men's Olympic basketball team|Redeem Team]]\". The Americans won after a remarkably close game 118-107. Four years later, at the [[Basketball at the 2012 Summer Olympics \u2013 Men's tournament|2012 Summer Olympics]] in London, the USA faced Spain for the gold once again. The Americans repeated as champions by the score of 107\u2013100, with Spain coming away with its third Olympic (and second straight) silver medal. During the [[Basketball at the 2016 Summer Olympics \u2013 Men's tournament|2016 Summer Olympics]], Spain reached the bronze medal match against [[Australia national basketball team|Australia]], where they escaped with an 89-88 victory.\n\n===FIBA World Cup===\nIn the early years of the [[FIBA World Cup]], Spain struggled to establish a steady presence as a competitor. Between 1950 and 1970, the national team only qualified once. Then, beginning in 1974 Spain developed into a serious competitor and regularly finished among the tournaments top performers for years to come.\n\nAt the [[2006 FIBA World Championship|2006 FIBA World Cup]], the Spanish team finally achieved the ultimate victory, the greatest success in its history. The date was 3 September 2006, as Spain won the [[2006 FIBA World Championship Final|gold medal game]] against the [[Greece national basketball team|Greek national team]]. Held in the [[Saitama Super Arena]] in Japan, the game ended with a final score of 70\u201347. [[Pau Gasol]] was named the tournament [[MVP]], and [[Jorge Garbajosa]] also made the All-Tournament team. Shortly afterwards, the team were awarded with the 2006 [[Prince of Asturias Award]] in Sports.\n\nAt the [[2019 FIBA Basketball World Cup|2019 FIBA World Cup]], Spain achieved its second gold medal after defeating [[Argentina national basketball team|Argentina]] in the [[2019 FIBA Basketball World Cup Final|final]] by the score of 95-75. The spectacular play of [[Ricky Rubio]] during the tournament earned him the [[FIBA Basketball World Cup Most Valuable Player|MVP]], while [[Marc Gasol]] was named to the [[FIBA Basketball World Cup All-Tournament Team|All-Tournament team]]. After this victory, Marc Gasol became the second player in tournament history to have won the [[List of NBA champions|NBA]] title and the World Cup in the same year, the other being [[Lamar Odom]].\n\n===EuroBasket===\nThe first game in the history of the selection was a qualifier for the [[EuroBasket 1935]], where Spain defeated [[Portugal national basketball team|Portugal]] 33\u201312.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.libertaddigital.com/deportes/la-seleccion-espanola-de-baloncesto-cumple-75-anos-1276390230/|title=La selecci\u00f3n espa\u00f1ola de baloncesto cumple 75 a\u00f1os|publisher=Libertad Digital|language=Spanish|date=15 April 2010|accessdate=15 May 2015}}</ref> This event, which was held in [[Geneva]] in the summer of 1935, was the first [[EuroBasket]] game in history. Spain finished 2nd and qualified for the 1936 Summer Olympics in [[Berlin]] where basketball was introduced for the first time.\n\nAfter several tries, Spain won their first continental championship in [[EuroBasket 2009|2009]], defeating [[Serbia national basketball team|Serbia]] to become [[EuroBasket 2009 Final|European champions]]. The team repeated their success in [[EuroBasket 2011|2011]], taking out France in the [[EuroBasket 2011 Final|final]]. At [[EuroBasket 2015]], Spain once again reached the [[EuroBasket 2015 Final|title game]], and demolished [[Lithuania national basketball team|Lithuania]] in the process 80\u201363.<ref>{{cite web|title=Spain crowned champions at EuroBasket 2015|url=http://www.fiba.basketball/pr54-spain-crowned-champions-at-record-breaking-eurobasket-2015|accessdate=20 September 2015}}</ref> Two years after winning it all in 2015, Spain followed it up with another strong performance at [[EuroBasket 2017]], defeating [[Russia national basketball team|Russia]] to win the bronze medal match.<ref>{{cite web|title=Spain at the EuroBasket 2017|url=http://www.fiba.basketball/eurobasket/2017/Spain|accessdate=17 September 2017}}</ref> It marked the fourth time Spain won the bronze at the EuroBasket, as they also won it in [[EuroBasket 1991|1991]], [[EuroBasket 2001|2001]], and [[EuroBasket 2013|2013]].\n\n===Other events===\nBesides success at the \"Big Three\" events (Summer Olympic Games, FIBA World Cup, and EuroBasket) Spain has also had success at the [[Basketball at the Mediterranean Games|Mediterranean Games]], where it has won several medals: three gold, four silver and one bronze.\n\n==Medal record==\nThe Spanish national team's medal record through the years:\n\n;[[Basketball at the Summer Olympics|Olympic Games]]:\n* Silver medals (3): [[Basketball at the 1984 Summer

They are managed by the [[Spanish Basketball Federation]], the governing body for [[basketball in Spain]].\n\nSpain has appeared 32 times at the [[EuroBasket]], winning three gold medals, six silver medals, and four bronze medals. They have also competed at the [[Basketball at the Summer Olympics|Summer Olympics]] 12 times, with three silver medals and one bronze medal as their accomplishments. They have qualified for the [[FIBA World Cup]] 12 times, winning it all twice, in [[2006 FIBA World Championship|2006]] and [[2019 FIBA Basketball World Cup|2019]].\n\nSpain is currently ranked 2nd in the [[FIBA World Rankings]], only behind the [[United States men's national basketball team|United States]].<ref>[http://www.fiba.com/pages/eng/fc/even/rank/p/rankMen.html FIBA.com \u2013 FIBA World Ranking for men<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\n==History==\n===Olympic Games===\nWhen Spain qualified for the [[Basketball at the 1936 Summer Olympics|1936 Summer Olympics]], where basketball was part of the games for the first time, expectations were high for the runner-up of the [[1935 EuroBasket]]. Unfortunately, as one of the favorites to win medals, Spain could not attend the Games because of the outbreak of the [[Spanish Civil War]] just days before the start of the Games.\n\nBefore the Spanish national team won the gold medal in the 2006 FIBA World Cup (see below), their greatest international success was reaching the final in the [[Basketball at the 1984 Summer Olympics|1984 Summer Olympics Basketball Tournament]] which took place in Los Angeles. The other finalist was the [[United States men's national basketball team|USA national team]] (led by [[Patrick Ewing]] and featuring a young [[Michael Jordan]]), which won the final and with it the gold medal. Spain, thus, took the Olympic silver medal.\n\nContinuing the success started at the 2006 FIBA World Cup, Spain again reached the final at the [[Basketball at the 2008 Summer Olympics \u2013 Men's tournament|2008 Summer Olympics]]. This proved to be a rematch of the 1984 Olympic final; this time, the USA team was led by [[Kobe Bryant]] and nicknamed the \"[[2008 United States men's Olympic basketball team|Redeem Team]]\". The Americans won after a remarkably close game 118-107. Four years later, at the [[Basketball at the 2012 Summer Olympics \u2013 Men's tournament|2012 Summer Olympics]] in London, the USA faced Spain for the gold once again. The Americans repeated as champions by the score of 107\u2013100, with Spain coming away with its third Olympic (and second straight) silver medal. During the [[Basketball at the 2016 Summer Olympics \u2013 Men's tournament|2016 Summer Olympics]], Spain reached the bronze medal match against [[Australia national basketball team|Australia]], where they escaped with an 89-88 victory.\n\n===FIBA World Cup===\nIn the early years of the [[FIBA World Cup]], Spain struggled to establish a steady presence as a competitor. Between 1950 and 1970, the national team only qualified once. Then, beginning in 1974 Spain developed into a serious competitor and regularly finished among the tournaments top performers for years to come.\n\nAt the [[2006 FIBA World Championship|2006 FIBA World Cup]], the Spanish team finally achieved the ultimate victory, the greatest success in its history. The date was 3 September 2006, as Spain won the [[2006 FIBA World Championship Final|gold medal game]] against the [[Greece national basketball team|Greek national team]]. Held in the [[Saitama Super Arena]] in Japan, the game ended with a final score of 70\u201347. [[Pau Gasol]] was named the tournament [[MVP]], and [[Jorge Garbajosa]] also made the All-Tournament team. Shortly afterwards, the team were awarded with the 2006 [[Prince of Asturias Award]] in Sports.\n\nAt the [[2019 FIBA Basketball World Cup|2019 FIBA World Cup]], Spain achieved its second gold medal after defeating [[Argentina national basketball team|Argentina]] in the [[2019 FIBA Basketball World Cup Final|final]] by the score of 95-75. The spectacular play of [[Ricky Rubio]] during the tournament earned him the [[FIBA Basketball World Cup Most Valuable Player|MVP]], while [[Marc Gasol]] was named to the [[FIBA Basketball World Cup All-Tournament Team|All-Tournament team]]. After this victory, Marc Gasol became the second player in tournament history to have won the [[List of NBA champions|NBA]] title and the World Cup in the same year, the other being [[Lamar Odom]].\n\n===EuroBasket===\nThe first game in the history of the selection was a qualifier for the [[EuroBasket 1935]], where Spain defeated [[Portugal national basketball team|Portugal]] 33\u201312.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.libertaddigital.com/deportes/la-seleccion-espanola-de-baloncesto-cumple-75-anos-1276390230/|title=La selecci\u00f3n espa\u00f1ola de baloncesto cumple 75 a\u00f1os|publisher=Libertad Digital|language=Spanish|date=15 April 2010|accessdate=15 May 2015}}</ref> This event, which was held in [[Geneva]] in the summer of 1935, was the first [[EuroBasket]] game in history. Spain finished 2nd and qualified for the 1936 Summer Olympics in [[Berlin]] where basketball was introduced for the first time.\n\nAfter several tries, Spain won their first continental championship in [[EuroBasket 2009|2009]], defeating [[Serbia national basketball team|Serbia]] to become [[EuroBasket 2009 Final|European champions]]. The team repeated their success in [[EuroBasket 2011|2011]], taking out France in the [[EuroBasket 2011 Final|final]]. At [[EuroBasket 2015]], Spain once again reached the [[EuroBasket 2015 Final|title game]], and demolished [[Lithuania national basketball team|Lithuania]] in the process 80\u201363.<ref>{{cite web|title=Spain crowned champions at EuroBasket 2015|url=http://www.fiba.basketball/pr54-spain-crowned-champions-at-record-breaking-eurobasket-2015|accessdate=20 September 2015}}</ref> Two years after winning it all in 2015, Spain followed it up with another strong performance at [[EuroBasket 2017]], defeating [[Russia national basketball team|Russia]] to win the bronze medal match.<ref>{{cite web|title=Spain at the EuroBasket 2017|url=http://www.fiba.basketball/eurobasket/2017/Spain|accessdate=17 September 2017}}</ref> It marked the fourth time Spain won the bronze at the EuroBasket, as they also won it in [[EuroBasket 1991|1991]], [[EuroBasket 2001|2001]], and [[EuroBasket 2013|2013]].\n\n===Other events===\nBesides success at the \"Big Three\" events (Summer Olympic Games, FIBA World Cup, and EuroBasket) Spain has also had success at the [[Basketball at the Mediterranean Games|Mediterranean Games]], where it has won several medals: three gold, four silver and one bronze.\n\n==Medal record==\nThe Spanish national team's medal record through the years:\n\n;[[Basketball at the Summer Olympics|Olympic Games]]:\n* Silver medals (3): [[Basketball at the 1984 Summer

Brains in richer, more stimulating environments have higher rates of [[synaptogenesis]] and more complex [[dendrites|dendrite arbors]], leading to increased brain activity. This effect takes place primarily during [[neurodevelopment]], but also during adulthood  to a lesser degree. With extra [[synapses]] there is also increased synapse activity, leading to an increased size and number of [[glia]]l energy-support cells. Environmental enrichment also enhances [[capillary]] vasculation, providing the neurons and glial cells with extra energy. The [[neuropil]] (neurons, glial cells, capillaries, combined together) expands, thickening the cortex. Research on rodent brains suggests that environmental enrichment may also lead to an increased rate of [[neurogenesis]].\n\nResearch on animals finds that environmental enrichment could aid the treatment and recovery of numerous brain-related dysfunctions, including [[Alzheimer's disease]] and those connected to [[aging]], whereas a lack of stimulation might impair cognitive development. Moreover, this research also suggests that environmental enrichment leads to a greater level of [[cognitive reserve]], the brain's resilience to the effects of conditions such as [[aging]] and [[dementia]].\n\nResearch on humans suggests that lack of stimulation delays and impairs cognitive development. Research also finds that attaining and engaging in higher levels of education, environments in which people participate in more challenging cognitively stimulating activities, results in greater cognitive reserve.\n\n== Early research ==\n[[Donald O.

There are two mains areas of focus: neurological rehabilitation and [[cognitive reserve]], the brain's resistance to the effects of exposure to physical, natural, and social threats. Although most of these experiments used animal subjects, mainly rodents, researchers have pointed to the affected areas of animal brains to which human brains are most similar and used their findings as evidence to show that humans would have comparable reactions to enriched environments. The tests done on animals are thus meant to represent human simulations for the following list of conditions.\n\n===Neurological rehabilitation===\n\n====Autism====\n\nA study conducted in 2011 led to the conclusion that environmental enrichment vastly improves the cognitive ability of children with [[autism]].

Brains in richer, more stimulating environments have higher rates of [[synaptogenesis]] and more complex [[dendrites|dendrite arbors]], leading to increased brain activity. This effect takes place primarily during [[neurodevelopment]], but also during adulthood  to a lesser degree. With extra [[synapses]] there is also increased synapse activity, leading to an increased size and number of [[glia]]l energy-support cells. Environmental enrichment also enhances [[capillary]] vasculation, providing the neurons and glial cells with extra energy. The [[neuropil]] (neurons, glial cells, capillaries, combined together) expands, thickening the cortex. Research on rodent brains suggests that environmental enrichment may also lead to an increased rate of [[neurogenesis]].\n\nResearch on animals finds that environmental enrichment could aid the treatment and recovery of numerous brain-related dysfunctions, including [[Alzheimer's disease]] and those connected to [[aging]], whereas a lack of stimulation might impair cognitive development. Moreover, this research also suggests that environmental enrichment leads to a greater level of [[cognitive reserve]], the brain's resilience to the effects of conditions such as [[aging]] and [[dementia]].\n\nResearch on humans suggests that lack of stimulation delays and impairs cognitive development. Research also finds that attaining and engaging in higher levels of education, environments in which people participate in more challenging cognitively stimulating activities, results in greater cognitive reserve.\n\n== Early research ==\n[[Donald O.

There are two mains areas of focus: neurological rehabilitation and [[cognitive reserve]], the brain's resistance to the effects of exposure to physical, natural, and social threats. Although most of these experiments used animal subjects, mainly rodents, researchers have pointed to the affected areas of animal brains to which human brains are most similar and used their findings as evidence to show that humans would have comparable reactions to enriched environments. The tests done on animals are thus meant to represent human simulations for the following list of conditions.\n\n===Neurological rehabilitation===\n\n====Autism====\n\nA study conducted in 2011 led to the conclusion that environmental enrichment vastly improves the cognitive ability of children with [[autism]].

This growth is occurring across multiple industries, including information and communications technology (ICTs), solar and wind energy and nuclear technology.<ref name=\":2\">{{cite web|url=http://www.jcp-jordan.org/en/page/ict|title=ICT|work=jcp-jordan.org}}</ref><ref>[https://photos.state.gov/libraries/jordan/444376/pdf/2014CCGFinal.pdf Doing Business in Jordan: 2014 Country Commercial Guide for U.S. Companies]</ref>\n\n== Science policy framework ==\n\n=== Science, Technology and Innovation Policy and Strategy ===\nJordan's Higher Council for Science and Technology (est. 1987) is an independent public body that acts as a national umbrella organization for scientific research. It is the Higher Council for Science and Technology which drew up the first national policy for science and technology in 1995. In 2013, it completed the national ''Science, Technology and Innovation Policy and Strategy'' (2013\u20132017), which has seven broad objectives. These are to:<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0023/002354/235406e.pdf|title=UNESCO Science Report: towards 2030|last=|first=|publisher=UNESCO|year=2015|isbn=978-92-3-100129-1|location=Paris|pages=}}</ref>\n* incite the government and the scientific community to adopt the requisite research priorities to develop a knowledge economy, as identified by the Higher Council for Science and Technology and the Scientific Research Support Fund in 2010 in ''Defining Scientific Research Priorities in Jordan for the Years 2011\u20132020'';\n* generalize a science culture in the education system;\n* harness research to development;\n* build knowledge networks in science, technology and research;\n* adopt innovation as a key stimulus for investment opportunities;\n* translate the results of research into commercial ventures; and \n* contribute to excellence in training and skills acquisition.\n\nThe Higher Council for Science and Technology has identified five domains in which projects are to be implemented to operationalize the policy: the institutional framework; policies and legislation; science, technology and innovation infrastructure; human resources; and the science, technology and innovation environment. An analysis of the national innovation system revealed that research was making an insufficient contribution to economic growth and to solving chronic problems, such as those related to water, energy and food. For the 2013\u20132017 period, some 24 projects were proposed at a projected cost of around US$14 million that was yet to be allocated by the government as of 2015. These include a review of the national policy for science and technology, institutionalizing innovation, developing incentive schemes for researchers and innovators, founding technology incubators and setting up a research database. A unit is to be created within the Higher Council for Science and Technology specifically for expatriate Jordanian scientists. The council is responsible for implementing, following up and evaluating all 24 projects, along with relevant ministries.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Observatory of Science, Technology and Innovation ===\nSince about 2009, the Higher Council for Science and Technology has been involved in a project that is setting up an Observatory of Science, Technology and Innovation, in collaboration with the United Nations\u2019 Economic and Social Commission for Western Asia (ESCWA). The observatory will maintain the country's first comprehensive database of domestic research and is to be hosted by the Higher Council for Science and Technology.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== National Innovation Strategy ===\nIn 2013, the Higher Council for Science and Technology published the ''National Innovation Strategy, 2013\u20132017'' (despite the similarity in name, not to be confused with the ''Science, Technology and Innovation Policy and Strategy,'' 2013\u20132017). The ''National Innovation Strategy, 2013\u20132017'' had been prepared in collaboration with the Ministry of Planning and International Co-operation, with the support of the [[World Bank]]. Targeted fields include energy, environment, health, ICTs, nanotechnology, education, engineering services, banking and clean technologies.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Scientific Research Support Fund ===\nJordan's Scientific Research Support Fund was revived in 2010 after being instituted in 2006. Administered by the Ministry of Higher Education and Scientific Research, it finances investment in human resources and infrastructure through competitive research grants related to ecological water management and technological applications. The fund backs entrepreneurial ventures and helps Jordanian companies to solve technical problems; it also encourages private bodies to allocate resources for R&D and provides university students with scholarships based on merit. So far, the fund has provided 13 million Jordanian dinars (''circa'' US$18.3 million) to finance R&D projects in Jordan, 70% of which has been used to fund projects in energy, water and health care.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Fund for Scientific Research and Vocational Training ===\nThe revamped Scientific Research Support Fund is also intended to streamline the activities supported by the Fund for Scientific Research and Vocational Training (est. 1997). This fund was launched partly to ensure that all public shareholding Jordanian companies either spent 1% of their net profits on research or vocational training within their own structure or paid an equivalent amount into the fund for redistribution for the same purpose. The problem was that the definition of what constituted research and vocational training was too broad. As a result, new regulations were adopted in 2010 to clarify the terms and provide for the collection of the 1% to be spent on research and development.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n== Higher education ==\n\n=== Policy issues ===\nEgypt, Iraq, Jordan, Lebanon, Palestine, Sudan and Syria all boast relatively mature higher education infrastructure that includes some of the oldest universities in the Arab world.<ref name=\":0\" /> Jordan's largest university, for instance, the [[University of Jordan]], was founded in 1962. It claims to have 17% international students.\n\nLike other Arab governments, Jordan is setting up an observatory to monitor its innovation system. When studying the data collected, however, analysts often see a direct correlation between the number of graduates or faculty and the number of researchers. This is misleading, as many students and faculty members do not conduct research and only a few actually publish in refereed journals listed by the Web of Science or Scopus and have international contacts. Many Arab universities are simply not research universities. Moreover, until recently, the terms of reference for a university professor in the Arab region did not include research, but now most of the universities take research into account as the main standard for that. The real test comes from counting the time spent effectively by an individual on research, as opposed to teaching or other tasks. It is rare for the actual research activity of teaching staff in government and most private universities to exceed 5\u201310% of their total academic duties, compared to 35\u201350% in European and American universities. In Jordan and many other Arab states, the bulk of scientific research is carried out within a higher education system that is faced with its own problems, including scarce resources and burgeoning student numbers. Under pressure to submit to the diktats of international university rankings, rectors are no longer certain whether their institutions should aim to generate knowledge (i.e. scientific publications) or transmit knowledge (i.e. teach).<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Trends in higher education ===\nThe most recent data available for government spending on education (4.94% of GDP), including higher education (0.92% of GDP), date from 1999.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://data.uis.unesco.org/?queryid=181|title=Government expenditure on higher education as a percentage of GDP|date=2017|website=UNESCO Institute for Statistics}}</ref> There were 60,686 tertiary students in 2011. Just 12% of them (7,225) graduated in science and engineering fields that year, compared to 44% in Tunisia.  In 2014, 52% of tertiary graduates in science, engineering and agriculture were women. They accounted for 65% of students in natural sciences, 13% of those in engineering and 74% of those studying agriculture - perhaps because of the growing importance of biotechnology in agriculture.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n== Research trends ==\n\n=== Financial investment in research ===\nThe research intensity of Jordan is fairly low (0.43% of GDP in [http://data.uis.unesco.org/Index.aspx?queryid=64 2008]), despite a growing number of public and private universities. Jordan trails the leading members of the [[Organisation of Islamic Cooperation]] for this indicator, namely [[Innovation in Malaysia|Malaysia]] (1.07% of GDP in 2011), Turkey (0.86% of GDP in 2011), [[Science and technology in Morocco|Morocco]] (0.73% in 2010), Egypt and Tunisia (0.68% of GDP in 2013 and 2012 respectively). Moreover, these five countries have announced their intention to raise their research intensity in coming years.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nIn many Arab states, the bulk of domestic research expenditure is performed by the government sector, followed by the higher education sector. The private sector assumes little or even no role in the research enterprise. Jordan, Morocco, Oman, Qatar, Tunisia and the United Arab Emirates are exceptions to the rule. The European Commission's Erawatch has estimated that the private sector performs one-third of research expenditure in Jordan. This compares with 30% in Morocco (2010), 29% in the United Arab Emirates (2011), 26% in Qatar (2012) and 24% in Oman (2011), according to Erawatch. The figure is closer to 20% in Tunisia, according to the [[UNESCO Institute for Statistics]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Human resources ===\nIn a context of rapid population growth, the number of researchers per million inhabitants is a more telling indicator of progress than sheer numbers. Jordan had 9,092 researchers (in head counts) in 2015, according to the [[UNESCO Institute for Statistics]], a density of 1,197 researchers per million inhabitants. These figures were higher in 2008, when there were 11,310 researchers in Jordan, representing a density of 1,913 per million inhabitants.[http://data.uis.unesco.org/Index.aspx?queryid=64]\n\nThe share of women researchers dropped between 2008 and 2015 from 22.5% to 19.7%.[http://data.uis.unesco.org/Index.aspx?queryid=64]  In 2008, women accounted for 26% of researchers in natural sciences, 18% of those in engineering, 44% of those in medical sciences, 19% of those in agricultural sciences and 32% of researchers in social sciences and humanities.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n'''Table: Share of female Arab researchers (%)'''\n\n'''''Selected countries, in head counts'''''\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|Tunisia  (2008)\n|47.4\n|-\n|Egypt  (2013)\n|42.8\n|-\n|Bahrain  (2013)\n|41.2\n|-\n|Kuwait  (2013)\n|37.3\n|-\n|Iraq  (2011)\n|34.2\n|-\n|Morocco  (2011)\n|30.2\n|-\n|Oman (2011)\n|24.9\n|-\n|Palestine (2010)\n|22.6\n|-\n|Jordan  (2015)\n|19.7\n|-\n|Qatar (2012)\n|21.9\n|-\n|Saudi Arabia (2009)\n|1.4\n|}\nSource: For Jordan, UNESCO Institute for Statistics.

Note: the data on Saudi Arabia only cover one university.\n\n=== Research output ===\n\nBetween 2005 and 2014, the number of publications catalogued in Thomson Reuters' Web of Science (Science Citation Index Expanded) climbed in almost every country in the world. In Jordan, the number rose from 641 (2005) to 1,093 (2014), with the growth rate slowing after 2008 after publications crossed the 1,000 a year threshold. With 146 publications per million inhabitants in 2014, Jordan's output in terms of scientific papers is of median level in the Arab world. It is surpassed by Qatar (548 per million), Saudi Arabia (371), Tunisia (276), Lebanon (203), Kuwait (174), the United Arab Emirates (154) and Oman (151) for this indicator. Qatar and Saudi Arabia both increased their scientific output considerably between 2005 and 2014, as part of a drive to recruit highly cited researchers from around the world for their universities.\n\nTwo-thirds of articles produced by scientists in the Arab world between 2008 and 2014 were co-authored with international partners. Jordan's closest collaborators were based in the United States of America (1,153 articles), Germany (586), Saudi Arabia (490), the United Kingdom (450) and Canada (259).<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe Thomson Reuters selection of Highly Cited Researchers of 2014 listed only three Arab scientists whose \u2018first\u2019 affiliation is with a university in the Arab world. They were Prof. Ali H. Nayfeh (University of Jordan and Virginia Tech), Prof. [[Shaher El-Momani]] (University of Jordan and King Abdulaziz University in Saudi Arabia) and Prof. Salim Messaoudi (Algeria), a faculty member of King Fahd University of Petroleum and Minerals in Saudi Arabia.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe majority of patent applications in Jordan are submitted by non-residents.

'What helps is that we are a country of human resources, as opposed to natural resources', he has said. 'In the absence of money and more lucrative industries, the Jordanian youth has spent the past decade building its passion for the \"you can do what you want attitude\" of our industry'.

Natural gas used to provide the bulk of Jordan's energy supply but this has changed since 2012, owing to gas supply constraints from Egypt. Jordan's electricity supply is now more than 90% reliant on heavy fuel oil and diesel. By 2015, Jordan is expected to need to generate 3,600 MWe to satisfy its energy needs, which are estimated to rise to 5000 MWe by 2020 and 8000 MWe by 2030.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\nTo compound matters, Jordan has a water deficit of about 600 million cubic metres (m3) per year (1500 m3 demand, 900 m3 supply). It pumps about 60 million m3/yr of fossil subartesian water from the Disi/Saq aquifer, a rate that is set to rise to 160 million m3/yr in 2013.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\nJordan's 2007 national energy strategy has envisaged taking 29% of primary energy from natural gas, 14% from oil shale, 10% from renewables and 6% from nuclear by 2020.\n\n=== Nuclear technology ===\nIn March 2017, the Jordan Atomic Energy Agency signed an agreement with Saudi Arabia's King Abdullah City for Atomic and Renewable Energy for a feasibility study on construction of two small modular reactors by 2020 near [[Qasr Amra]] for the production of electricity and desalinated water. Additionally, a small research reactor was inaugurated in December 2016, called the [[Jordan Research and Training Reactor]], located at the [[Jordan University of Science and Technology]] campus in [[Ar-Ramtha]].

The solar facility is being developed by Masdar's subsidiary, the Baynouna Solar Energy Company. Once connected to the national grid, the solar facility will supply the annual power needs of around 110,000 homes and displace an estimated 360,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions each year.

The strategy has three main thrusts: academic training in science and engineering, scientific research and regional and international scientific co-operation. One of the strategy's key objectives is to involve the private sector more in regional and interdisciplinary collaboration, in order to add economic and development value to research and make better use of available expertise. Up to now, science, technology and innovation policies in Arab states have failed to catalyse knowledge production effectively or add value to products and services because they focus on developing research without taking the business community on board. There has also been a lot of talk about re-orienting the education system towards innovation and entrepreneurship but little action.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nIn the ''Arab Strategy for Science, Technology and Innovation,'' countries are urged to engage in greater international co-operation in 14 scientific disciplines and strategic economic sectors, including nuclear energy, space sciences and convergent technologies such as bio-informatics and nanobiotechnology. The ''Strategy'' advocates involving scientists from the diaspora and urges scientists to engage in public outreach; it also calls for greater investment in higher education and training to build a critical mass of experts and staunch brain drain. The ''Strategy'' nevertheless eludes some core issues, including the delicate question of who will foot the hefty bill of implementing the strategy.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== SESAME particle accelerator ===\nJordan hosts a world-class research facility which is also fostering scientific co-operation, the [[Synchrotron-Light for Experimental Science and Applications in the Middle East|Synchrotron-light for Experimental Science and Applications in the Middle East]] (SESAME), which was officially inaugurated on 17 May 2017 but had begun conducting experiments earlier.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://en.unesco.org/sesame-history|title=SESAME: a Visionary Endeavour in Science and Diplomacy|date=16 May 2017|work=UNESCO|access-date=10 June 2017}}</ref> Construction of the centre began in Allan in 2003 and was completed in 2008.

The light source acts like a super X-ray machine and can be used by researchers to study everything from viruses and new drugs to novel materials and archaeological artefacts. There are about 50 such storage-ring based synchrotrons in use around the world.

The centres acts as a platform for regional exchanges on policy and technical issues. It also encourages private-sector participation to promote the growth of a regional industry in renewable energy. The other eight founding partners are Algeria, Lebanon, Morocco, Libya, Palestine, Syria, Tunisia and Yemen. The centre has several development partners, including the [[European Union]], German Agency for Technical Co-operation and the [[Danish International Development Agency]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== ESCWA Technology Centre ===\nJordan has hosted the ESCWA Technology Centre since its inception in 2011.

It is the Higher Council for Science and Technology which drew up the first national policy for science and technology in 1995. In 2013, it completed the national ''Science, Technology and Innovation Policy and Strategy'' (2013\u20132017), which has seven broad objectives. These are to:<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0023/002354/235406e.pdf|title=UNESCO Science Report: towards 2030|last=|first=|publisher=UNESCO|year=2015|isbn=978-92-3-100129-1|location=Paris|pages=}}</ref>\n* incite the government and the scientific community to adopt the requisite research priorities to develop a knowledge economy, as identified by the Higher Council for Science and Technology and the Scientific Research Support Fund in 2010 in ''Defining Scientific Research Priorities in Jordan for the Years 2011\u20132020'';\n* generalize a science culture in the education system;\n* harness research to development;\n* build knowledge networks in science, technology and research;\n* adopt innovation as a key stimulus for investment opportunities;\n* translate the results of research into commercial ventures; and \n* contribute to excellence in training and skills acquisition.\n\nThe Higher Council for Science and Technology has identified five domains in which projects are to be implemented to operationalize the policy: the institutional framework; policies and legislation; science, technology and innovation infrastructure; human resources; and the science, technology and innovation environment. An analysis of the national innovation system revealed that research was making an insufficient contribution to economic growth and to solving chronic problems, such as those related to water, energy and food. For the 2013\u20132017 period, some 24 projects were proposed at a projected cost of around US$14 million that was yet to be allocated by the government as of 2015. These include a review of the national policy for science and technology, institutionalizing innovation, developing incentive schemes for researchers and innovators, founding technology incubators and setting up a research database. A unit is to be created within the Higher Council for Science and Technology specifically for expatriate Jordanian scientists. The council is responsible for implementing, following up and evaluating all 24 projects, along with relevant ministries.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Observatory of Science, Technology and Innovation ===\nSince about 2009, the Higher Council for Science and Technology has been involved in a project that is setting up an Observatory of Science, Technology and Innovation, in collaboration with the United Nations\u2019 Economic and Social Commission for Western Asia (ESCWA). The observatory will maintain the country\u2019s first comprehensive database of domestic research and is to be hosted by the Higher Council for Science and Technology.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== National Innovation Strategy ===\nIn 2013, the Higher Council for Science and Technology published the ''National Innovation Strategy, 2013\u20132017'' (despite the similarity in name, not to be confused with the ''Science, Technology and Innovation Policy and Strategy,'' 2013\u20132017). The ''National Innovation Strategy, 2013\u20132017'' had been prepared in collaboration with the Ministry of Planning and International Co-operation, with the support of the [[World Bank]]. Targeted fields include energy, environment, health, ICTs, nanotechnology, education, engineering services, banking and clean technologies.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Scientific Research Support Fund ===\nJordan\u2019s Scientific Research Support Fund was revived in 2010 after being instituted in 2006. Administered by the Ministry of Higher Education and Scientific Research, it finances investment in human resources and infrastructure through competitive research grants related to ecological water management and technological applications. The fund backs entrepreneurial ventures and helps Jordanian companies to solve technical problems; it also encourages private bodies to allocate resources for R&D and provides university students with scholarships based on merit. So far, the fund has provided 13 million Jordanian dinars (''circa'' US$18.3 million) to finance R&D projects in Jordan, 70% of which has been used to fund projects in energy, water and health care.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Fund for Scientific Research and Vocational Training ===\nThe revamped Scientific Research Support Fund is also intended to streamline the activities supported by the Fund for Scientific Research and Vocational Training (est. 1997). This fund was launched partly to ensure that all public shareholding Jordanian companies either spent 1% of their net profits on research or vocational training within their own structure or paid an equivalent amount into the fund for redistribution for the same purpose. The problem was that the definition of what constituted research and vocational training was too broad. As a result, new regulations were adopted in 2010 to clarify the terms and provide for the collection of the 1% to be spent on research and development.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n== Higher education ==\n\n=== Policy issues ===\nEgypt, Iraq, Jordan, Lebanon, Palestine, Sudan and Syria all boast relatively mature higher education infrastructure that includes some of the oldest universities in the Arab world.<ref name=\":0\" /> Jordan's largest university, for instance, the [[University of Jordan]], was founded in 1962. It claims to have 17% international students.\n\nLike other Arab governments, Jordan is setting up an observatory to monitor its innovation system. When studying the data collected, however, analysts often see a direct correlation between the number of graduates or faculty and the number of researchers. This is misleading, as many students and faculty members do not conduct research and only a few actually publish in refereed journals listed by the Web of Science or Scopus and have international contacts. Many Arab universities are simply not research universities. Moreover, until recently, the terms of reference for a university professor in the Arab region did not include research, but now most of the universities take research into account as the main standard for that. The real test comes from counting the time spent effectively by an individual on research, as opposed to teaching or other tasks. It is rare for the actual research activity of teaching staff in government and most private universities to exceed 5\u201310% of their total academic duties, compared to 35\u201350% in European and American universities. In Jordan and many other Arab states, the bulk of scientific research is carried out within a higher education system that is faced with its own problems, including scarce resources and burgeoning student numbers. Under pressure to submit to the diktats of international university rankings, rectors are no longer certain whether their institutions should aim to generate knowledge (i.e. scientific publications) or transmit knowledge (i.e. teach).<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Trends in higher education ===\nThe most recent data available for government spending on education (4.94% of GDP), including higher education (0.92% of GDP), date from 1999.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://data.uis.unesco.org/?queryid=181|title=Government expenditure on higher education as a percentage of GDP|date=2017|website=UNESCO Institute for Statistics}}</ref> There were 60,686 tertiary students in 2011. Just 12% of them (7,225) graduated in science and engineering fields that year, compared to 44% in Tunisia.  In 2014, 52% of tertiary graduates in science, engineering and agriculture were women. They accounted for 65% of students in natural sciences, 13% of those in engineering and 74% of those studying agriculture - perhaps because of the growing importance of biotechnology in agriculture.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n== Research trends ==\n\n=== Financial investment in research ===\nThe research intensity of Jordan is fairly low (0.43% of GDP in [http://data.uis.unesco.org/Index.aspx?queryid=64 2008]), despite a growing number of public and private universities. Jordan trails the leading members of the [[Organisation of Islamic Cooperation]] for this indicator, namely [[Innovation in Malaysia|Malaysia]] (1.07% of GDP in 2011), Turkey (0.86% of GDP in 2011), [[Science and technology in Morocco|Morocco]] (0.73% in 2010), Egypt and Tunisia (0.68% of GDP in 2013 and 2012 respectively). Moreover, these five countries have announced their intention to raise their research intensity in coming years.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nIn many Arab states, the bulk of domestic research expenditure is performed by the government sector, followed by the higher education sector. The private sector assumes little or even no role in the research enterprise. Jordan, Morocco, Oman, Qatar, Tunisia and the United Arab Emirates are exceptions to the rule. The European Commission's Erawatch has estimated that the private sector performs one-third of research expenditure in Jordan. This compares with 30% in Morocco (2010), 29% in the United Arab Emirates (2011), 26% in Qatar (2012) and 24% in Oman (2011), according to Erawatch. The figure is closer to 20% in Tunisia, according to the [[UNESCO Institute for Statistics]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Human resources ===\nIn a context of rapid population growth, the number of researchers per million inhabitants is a more telling indicator of progress than sheer numbers. Jordan had 9,092 researchers (in head counts) in 2015, according to the [[UNESCO Institute for Statistics]], a density of 1,197 researchers per million inhabitants. These figures were higher in 2008, when there were 11,310 researchers in Jordan, representing a density of 1,913 per million inhabitants.[http://data.uis.unesco.org/Index.aspx?queryid=64]\n\nThe share of women researchers dropped between 2008 and 2015 from 22.5% to 19.7%.[http://data.uis.unesco.org/Index.aspx?queryid=64]  In 2008, women accounted for 26% of researchers in natural sciences, 18% of those in engineering, 44% of those in medical sciences, 19% of those in agricultural sciences and 32% of researchers in social sciences and humanities.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n'''Table: Share of female Arab researchers (%)'''\n\n'''''Selected countries, in head counts'''''\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|Tunisia  (2008)\n|47.4\n|-\n|Egypt  (2013)\n|42.8\n|-\n|Bahrain  (2013)\n|41.2\n|-\n|Kuwait  (2013)\n|37.3\n|-\n|Iraq  (2011)\n|34.2\n|-\n|Morocco  (2011)\n|30.2\n|-\n|Oman (2011)\n|24.9\n|-\n|Palestine (2010)\n|22.6\n|-\n|Jordan  (2015)\n|19.7\n|-\n|Qatar (2012)\n|21.9\n|-\n|Saudi Arabia (2009)\n|1.4\n|}\nSource: For Jordan, UNESCO Institute for Statistics.

Note: the data on Saudi Arabia only cover one university.\n\n=== Research output ===\n\nBetween 2005 and 2014, the number of publications catalogued in Thomson Reuters' Web of Science (Science Citation Index Expanded) climbed in almost every country in the world. In Jordan, the number rose from 641 (2005) to 1,093 (2014), with the growth rate slowing after 2008 after publications crossed the 1,000 a year threshold. With 146 publications per million inhabitants in 2014, Jordan's output in terms of scientific papers is of median level in the Arab world. It is surpassed by Qatar (548 per million), Saudi Arabia (371), Tunisia (276), Lebanon (203), Kuwait (174), the United Arab Emirates (154) and Oman (151) for this indicator. Qatar and Saudi Arabia both increased their scientific output considerably between 2005 and 2014, as part of a drive to recruit highly cited researchers from around the world for their universities.\n\nTwo-thirds of articles produced by scientists in the Arab world between 2008 and 2014 were co-authored with international partners. Jordan's closest collaborators were based in the United States of America (1,153 articles), Germany (586), Saudi Arabia (490), the United Kingdom (450) and Canada (259).<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe Thomson Reuters selection of Highly Cited Researchers of 2014 listed only three Arab scientists whose \u2018first\u2019 affiliation is with a university in the Arab world. They were Prof. Ali H.

'What helps is that we are a country of human resources, as opposed to natural resources', he has said. 'In the absence of money and more lucrative industries, the Jordanian youth has spent the past decade building its passion for the \"you can do what you want attitude\" of our industry'. Al Issi adds the information technology educational structure to the list of Jordanian assets. 'Historically, most of the large web start-ups have been Jordanian in origin, like Manitoba, al-Bawaba and Jeeran,' she adds.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nJordan's ICT sector has also enjoyed the support of the monarchy.

Natural gas used to provide the bulk of Jordan's energy supply but this has changed since 2012, owing to gas supply constraints from Egypt. Jordan's electricity supply is now more than 90% reliant on heavy fuel oil and diesel. By 2015, Jordan is expected to need to generate 3,600 MWe to satisfy its energy needs, which are estimated to rise to 5000 MWe by 2020 and 8000 MWe by 2030.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\nTo compound matters, Jordan has a water deficit of about 600 million cubic metres (m3) per year (1500 m3 demand, 900 m3 supply). It pumps about 60 million m3/yr of fossil subartesian water from the Disi/Saq aquifer, a rate that is set to rise to 160 million m3/yr in 2013.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\nJordan's 2007 national energy strategy has envisaged taking 29% of primary energy from natural gas, 14% from oil shale, 10% from renewables and 6% from nuclear by 2020.\n\n=== Nuclear technology ===\nIn March 2017, the Jordan Atomic Energy Agency signed an agreement with Saudi Arabia\u2019s King Abdullah City for Atomic and Renewable Energy for a feasibility study on construction of two small modular reactors by 2020 near [[Qasr Amra]] for the production of electricity and desalinated water. Additionally, a small research reactor was inaugurated in December 2016, called the [[Jordan Research and Training Reactor]], located at the [[Jordan University of Science and Technology]] campus in [[Ar-Ramtha]].

The strategy has three main thrusts: academic training in science and engineering, scientific research and regional and international scientific co-operation. One of the strategy\u2019s key objectives is to involve the private sector more in regional and interdisciplinary collaboration, in order to add economic and development value to research and make better use of available expertise. Up to now, science, technology and innovation policies in Arab states have failed to catalyse knowledge production effectively or add value to products and services because they focus on developing research without taking the business community on board. There has also been a lot of talk about re-orienting the education system towards innovation and entrepreneurship but little action.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nIn the ''Arab Strategy for Science, Technology and Innovation,'' countries are urged to engage in greater international co-operation in 14 scientific disciplines and strategic economic sectors, including nuclear energy, space sciences and convergent technologies such as bio-informatics and nanobiotechnology. The ''Strategy'' advocates involving scientists from the diaspora and urges scientists to engage in public outreach; it also calls for greater investment in higher education and training to build a critical mass of experts and staunch brain drain. The ''Strategy'' nevertheless eludes some core issues, including the delicate question of who will foot the hefty bill of implementing the strategy.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== SESAME particle accelerator ===\nJordan hosts a world-class research facility which is also fostering scientific co-operation, the [[Synchrotron-Light for Experimental Science and Applications in the Middle East|Synchrotron-light for Experimental Science and Applications in the Middle East]] (SESAME), which was officially inaugurated on 17 May 2017 but had begun conducting experiments earlier.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://en.unesco.org/sesame-history|title=SESAME: a Visionary Endeavour in Science and Diplomacy|date=16 May 2017|work=UNESCO|access-date=10 June 2017}}</ref> Construction of the centre began in Allan in 2003 and was completed in 2008.
