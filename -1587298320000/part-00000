Some of these rule changes sought to enhance it as a spectator sport, and others aimed to improve safety. Several of these rule changes de-emphasised the groundwork aspects of judo, and others have reduced the range of [[joint lock]]s application. Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu did not follow these changes to judo rules, and this divergence gave BJJ a distinct identity as a grappling art,<ref name=rules>[http://ibjjf.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/RulesIBJJF_v4_en-US.pdf \"IBJJF rules\"] ([[International Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu Federation]]), accessed April 3, 2008</ref> although it's still recognizably related to judo. Other factors that have contributed towards the stylistic divergence of BJJ from the sport judo include the Gracies' contribution to the art, including emphasis on full-contact fighting.\n\nBJJ permits the same techniques that judo allows when taking combat to the ground. These include judo's scoring [[throw (grappling)|throws]] as well as judo's non-scoring techniques that it refers to as \"skillful takedowns\" (such as the [[flying armbar]]). BJJ also allows any and all takedowns used in wrestling, sambo, or any other grappling arts including direct attempts to take down by touching the legs.

On the ground, physical strength can be offset or enhanced through proper grappling techniques.\n\nBJJ employs a wide range of takedown techniques to bring an opponent to the ground such as \"[[Guard (grappling)#Pulling Guard|pulling guard]]\", which is not used in other combat sports such as Judo or Wrestling. Once the opponent is on the ground, a number of maneuvers (and counter-maneuvers) are available to manipulate the opponent into a suitable position for the application of a submission technique. Achieving a dominant position on the ground is one of the hallmarks of BJJ, which includes effective use of the [[Guard (grappling)|guard]] position to defend oneself from bottom (using both submissions and sweeps, with sweeps leading to the possibility of dominant position or an opportunity to pass the guard), and passing the guard to dominate from top position with [[side control]], [[Mount (grappling)|mount]], and [[back mount]] positions. This system of maneuvering and manipulation can be likened to a form of kinetic or physical chess when executed by two experienced practitioners.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cnbc.com/2018/12/05/ex-navy-seal-commander-heres-why-so-many-smart-people-practicebrazilian-jiu-jitsu.html|title=Ex-Navy SEAL commander: Here's why so many smart people practice Brazilian jiu-jitsu|first=Zameena|last=Mejia|date=5 December 2018|website=Cnbc.com}}</ref> A submission hold in BJJ is often assimilated to the equivalent of \"checkmate\", where the opponent is left with no other option but to tap, be injured, or choked.\n\n[[Renzo Gracie]] wrote in his book ''Mastering JUJITSU'':\n\n{{quote|\"The classical jujutsu of old Japan appeared to have no common strategy to guide a combatant over the course of a fight.

Renzo Gracie stated that this was a fundamental influence of the Gracie approach to combat. These strategies were further developed over time by the Gracies and others, and became prominent in contemporary MMA.\n\n=== Ground fighting ===\n[[File:Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu Demonstration.ogv|thumb|right|A demonstration of Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu during a class at Standard BJJ in Rockville, MD.]]\nBJJ is mainly differentiated from other martial arts by its greater emphasis on ground fighting. Commonly, striking-based martial arts place little to no emphasis on groundwork. BJJ also places little emphasis on standing techniques, such as [[Strike (attack)|striking]] and [[Throw (grappling)|throws]], although it employs some basic [[Takedown (grappling)|takedowns]], such as [[Single leg takedown|single]] and [[double leg takedown]]s, and some BJJ clubs and practitioners [[cross-training|cross train]] with [[wrestling]], judo, and [[Sambo (martial art)|sambo]].\n\n=== Training methods ===\n[[File:Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu strengthens camaraderie, build trust at Camp Lemonnier 140727-F-SJ695-033.jpg|thumb|A Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu instructor gently demonstrates how to tackle an opponent.]]\nBJJ focuses on submissions without the use of [[Strike (attack)|strikes]], while training allows practitioners to practice at full speed and with full strength, resembling the effort used in competition. Training methods include technique drills in which techniques are practiced against a non-resisting partner; isolation sparring (commonly referred to as positional drilling) where only a certain technique or sets of techniques are used; and full sparring where each practitioner tries to submit their opponent through technique. Physical conditioning is also an important aspect of training.\n\nThe [[Gracie family]] lineage descended from Helio Gracie focuses on practical applications of BJJ that apply primarily to self-defense.<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxlW9dmsPJs Carlos Sr. vs Helio: The Truth About the Gracie Family History and Politics ] Kama Jiu-Jitsu, August 14, 2017</ref> They will often run development drills in which a person is surrounded by a circle of other students who will attempt to attack the defending student, who in turn must defend themselves using techniques. The student will often be unable to see the aggressor to simulate an attack that they weren't expecting.{{Citation needed|date=December 2018}}\n\n== Primary ground positions ==\n{{Main|Grappling position}}\n{{More citations needed section|date=December 2009}}\n\nOnce on the ground, the BJJ practitioner strives to take a dominant or controlling position from where to apply submissions. These positions provide different submission or transition options.\n\n=== Side control ===\n{{Main|Side control}}\n[[File:Udegarami.JPG|thumb|An \"americana\" or \"paintbrush\" submission from traditional [[side control]]]]\n\nIn side control, the practitioner pins his opponent to the ground from the side of their torso. The top grappler lies across the opponent with weight applied to the opponent's chest. The opponent may be further controlled by pressure on either side of the shoulders and hips from the practitioner's elbows, shoulders, and knees. A wide variety of submissions can be initiated from side control. It is also referred to as the side mount. Additionally, the typical side mount increases opportunity for the top grappler to advance to other dominant positions. This position is often used in MMA as it allows the top fighter to strike whilst overcoming their opponents defence. Variants of the side control include Twister Side Control (popularized by [[Eddie Bravo]]), Brazilian Crossbody, [[kesa gatame]], \"Wrestler Pin\", knee mount, and other positions.<ref>{{cite web|last=Patterson|first=Jeff|title=Know Your Cross-Body Pins|url=http://nwfighting.com/know-your-jiu-jitsu-positions-cross-body-pins.html/|work=nwfighting.com|publisher=Northwest Fighting Arts|accessdate=10 March 2014}}</ref>\n\n=== Full mount ===\n{{Main|Mount (grappling)}}\n[[File:Andrea Galvao.jpg|thumb|left|[[Mount (grappling)|Full Mount]] is considered one of the most dominant [[grappling position]]s.]]\n\nIn the mount (or full mount) position, the practitioner sits astride the opponent's front torso or chest, controlling the opponent with his bodyweight and hips. In the strongest form of this position, the practitioner works his knees into the opponent's armpits to reduce arm movements and ability to move or counter submission attempts. Full Mount can be used to apply a variety of submissions including armlocks or chokes.\n\n=== Back mount ===\n{{Main|Back mount}}\n[[File:Back mount.jpg|thumb|Back mount, also considered one of the most dominant positions in BJJ]]\n\nWhen taking the back mount position (often known in Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu as the ''back grab'' or ''attacking the back''), the practitioner attaches to the back of the opponent by wrapping his legs around and hooking the opponent's thighs with their heel,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://ibjjf.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/RulesIBJJF_v4_en-US.pdf |title=International Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu Federation \u2013 Rule Book |work =Official IFBJJ rules, see Article 5 \u2013 Fighting Conclusions, The order of the referee, subsection \u2013 E |accessdate=June 10, 2010}}</ref> or locking in a body triangle by crossing one shin across the waist like a belt then placing the back of the opposing knee over the instep as if finishing a triangle choke. Simultaneously, the upper body is controlled by wrapping the arms around the chest or neck of the opponent. This position is often used to apply [[chokeholds]], as well as arm bars and triangles, and neutralizes an opponent's potential size or strength advantage.\n\n=== North South position ===\nThe North South position occurs when a practitioner is lying on their back on the ground and their opponent is lying on top, with the head over the chest area and controlling the bottom practitioner's arms. As with most top controlling positions in BJJ, the top practitioner applies pressure by bringing their hips downwards towards the ground, generating what is referred to as ''deadweight''. There are several submissions and transitions that are possible from the North South position, most commonly the North South choke, North South [[Kimura lock|kimura]], and others.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://bjj-world.com/bjj-north-south-position-attacks/|title=Versatile Attacks From The BJJ North-South Position|first=Ognen|last=Dzabirski|date=26 March 2018|website=Bjj-world.com|accessdate=5 March 2019}}</ref>\n\n=== Guards ===\n{{Main|Guard (grappling)}}\n[[File:Brazilian Jiu-jitsu-Closed guard.jpg|thumb|left|The Jiu-Jitsu practitioner in blue is demonstrating a type of closed [[Guard (grappling)|guard]]]]\n\nWhen in the \"Guard\" position, the practitioner is on their back controlling an opponent with his legs. The bottom practitioner pushes and pulls with the legs or feet to unbalance and limit the movements of his opponent. This position allows practitioners a wide variety of counter-attacks from the bottom position, including submissions and sweeps.\n\nThe three most common types of guards include the Closed Guard, Half Guard, and Open Guard.\n\nIn closed guard, the bottom grappler has his legs around the opponent's hips, with ankles closed together to control their opponent. The closed guard can be an effective position. This guard allows many setups for submissions such as jointlocks and chokes, as well as sweeps. In the open guard, the legs are not hooked together and the bottom grappler uses his legs or feet to push or pull their opponent.\n\nThere are many variations of open guard with distinct names and positioning including the Butterfly Guard, De La Riva Guard, X-Guard, Rubber guard, Spider Guard, Octopus Guard, Lapel Guard, Worm Guard (made popular by [[Keenan Cornelius]]) and others. Butterfly guard is when the bottom grappler brings his legs up and feet together against the inner thighs of top opponent. The name is derived from the resulting butterfly wing shape. Butterfly guard increases both space to maneuver and the ability counter the opponent with the shins or arches of the feet against the competitor's inner thighs.\n\nIn the half guard, one of the top grappler's legs is controlled by the bottom grappler's legs, preventing the top opponent from passing side control or full mount positions.  There is also a variant of half guard called \"50/50 guard\", which consist of each opponent usually in sitting positions with one of their legs hooking the same leg of their opponent in a mirrored fashion. This position is called 50/50 because neither opponent has a distinct advantage, where both sides have the same possibilities of sweeps and attacks.\n\nAnother variation of the half guard position is the \"deep half guard\", which involves the bottom grappler positioning themselves underneath their opponent, grabbing the top grappler's thigh. This gives the individual on the bottom the opportunity to sweep their opponent, and end up on a more dominant, top position. This position was popularized by American BJJ Black Belt, [[Jeff Glover]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://wbbjj.com/uncle-richard-guard/|title=Having Problems Understanding Deep Half Guard? Jeff Glover Presents \"Uncle Richard Guard\".|date=2017-04-13|work=White Belt Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu|access-date=2018-09-18|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\n== Submissions ==\n\n{{For|a list of list of Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu techniques|List of Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu techniques}}\n\nThe majority of submission holds can be grouped into two broad categories: [[joint lock]]s and [[chokehold|chokes]]. Joint locks typically involve isolating an opponent's limb and creating a lever with the body position, which will force the joint to move past its normal range of motion.<ref name=\"mma\"/> Pressure is increased in a controlled manner and released if the opponent cannot escape the hold and signals defeat by [[Submission (combat sport)|tapping]]. A choke hold can disrupt the blood supply to the brain and cause unconsciousness if the opponent does not tap when required.\n\n=== Compression locks ===\n\n''See also'' [[Compression lock]]\n\nA less common type of submission hold is a [[compression lock]], where the muscle of an opponent is compressed against a hard, large bone (commonly the shin or wrist), causing significant pain to the opponent. These types of locks are not usually allowed in competition due to the high risk of tearing muscle tissue. This type of lock also often hyper-extends the joint in the opposite direction, pulling it apart. Some compression locks include the [[Compression lock#Achilles lock|Achilles lock]], [[Compression lock#Biceps slicer|Bicep slicer]], and [[Compression lock#Leg slicer|Leg slicer]] (or Calf slicer).\n\n=== Joint locks ===\n[[File:In-guard armbar.jpg|thumb|upright|left|A practitioner attempting an [[armbar]] submission]]\n\nWhile many joint locks are permitted in BJJ, most competitions ban or restrict some or all joint locks that involve the knees, ankles, and spine. The reason for this is that the angles of manipulation required to cause pain are nearly the same as those that would cause serious injury. Joint locks that require a twisting motion of the knee (such as heel hooks or knee bars) are usually banned in competitions because successfully completing the move can frequently result in permanent damage, often requiring surgery. Similarly, [[Neck Crank|joint manipulations of the spine]] are typically barred due to the inherent danger of crushing or misaligning [[cervical vertebrae]]. Leglocks are allowed in varying degrees depending on skill level, with the most prominent BJJ tournaments typically allowing only the straight ankle lock and muscle stretching submissions such as the \"banana split\" from white through purple belt, with the kneebar, toehold, and calf slicer submissions being permitted at brown and black belt. Most competitions do not allow [[heel hooks]], which are considered to be exceptionally dangerous.<ref name=USGR/><ref>{{cite web|author=Eric Pearch |url=http://www.couch2cage.com/taboo-techniques-the-heel-hook-in-bjj-and-mma/ |title=Taboo techniques |website=Couch2cage.com |date=2010-11-16 |accessdate=2014-02-17}}</ref> However, most joint locks involving the wrist, elbow, shoulder or ankle are permitted as there is a great deal more flexibility in those joints and those locks are usually safe.\n\nJoint locks include armbars, kimuras, Americanas, straight-arm lock, omoplata, marceloplata, banana split (or electric chair), twister, wrist lock, heel hook, toehold, kneebar, straight ankle lock, and others.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bjjtech.com/tech/tech-list.asp?id=3&sub=y&name=Submissions|title=BJJ Technique Catalog: Category: Submissions|work=bjjtech.com}}</ref>\n\n=== Chokes ===\n[[File:MCMAP Rear choke - Defense Visual Information Center 2006.jpg|upright|thumb|A [[rear naked choke]], as demonstrated by a [[MCMAP]] instructor]]\n[[Chokehold|Chokes]] are common forms of submission. In BJJ, the chokes that are used put pressure on the [[carotid]] arteries, and may also apply pressure to the nerve [[baroreceptor]]s in the neck. This kind of choke is very fast acting (if done properly) with victims typically losing consciousness in around 3\u20135 seconds. In contrast, an air choke (involving constriction of the [[windpipe]]) can take up to two minutes, depending on how long the person can hold their breath, and may cause serious damage to the throat.\n\nChokes include [[rear-naked choke]], [[Sankaku-jime|triangle]], [[Okuri eri jime|bow and arrow choke]], [[Sode guruma jime|sleeve choke]] (or Ezekiel choke), guillotine, cross collar choke (or X choke), [[Kata juji jime#variants|baseball choke]], D'Arce, clock choke, [[Arm triangle choke]], north\u2013south choke, crucifix choke, anaconda choke, [[Gogoplata]], loop choke, and others.\n\n== Uniform ==\n{{Main|Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu gi}}\nThe Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu practitioner's uniform (commonly referred to using the Japanese terms ''[[Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu gi|gi]]'' or ''[[kimono]]'') is similar to a [[judogi]], but often made of lighter material with tighter cuffs on the pants and jacket. This allows the practitioner to benefit from a closer fit, providing less material for an opponent to manipulate, although there is a significant overlap in the standards that allows for a carefully selected gi to be legal for competition in both styles. Traditionally, to be [[Brazilian jiu-jitsu ranking system|promoted]] in Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, the wearing of the Jiu-Jitsu gi while training is a requirement. Recently with the growing popularity of \"no-gi\" Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, the practice of giving out belts to no gi practitioners (e.g., [[Rolles Gracie]] awarding [[Rashad Evans]] a black belt) has become more common.\n{{clear}}\n\n== Grading ==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"float:right; text-align:center;\"\n|+Black belt grades<br />(19 and over)\n|-\n|| Black 0\u20136 || style=\"background:white;\" | [[File:BJJ BlackBelt.svg|75px]]\n|-\n|| Black/Red 7 || style=\"background:white;\" | [[File:BJJ black red belt.svg|75px]]\n|-\n|| Red/White 8 || style=\"background:white;\" | [[File:BJJ red white belt.svg|75px]]\n|-\n|| Red 9\u201310 || style=\"background:white;\" | [[File:BJJ Red Belt.svg|75px]]\n|}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"float:right; text-align:center;\"\n|+Senior belt colors<br />(16 and over)\n|-\n|| White || style=\"brackground:white;\" | [[File:BJJ White Belt.svg|75px]]\n|-\n|| Blue || style=\"background:white;\" | [[File:BJJ Blue Belt.svg|75px]]\n|-\n|| Purple || style=\"background:white;\" | [[File:BJJ Purple Belt.svg|75px]]\n|-\n|| Brown || style=\"background:white;\" | [[File:BJJ Brown Belt.svg|75px]]\n|}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"float:right; text-align:center;\"\n|+Junior belt colours<br />(16 and under)\n|-\n|| White || style=\"background:white;\" | [[File:BJJ White Belt.svg|75px]]\n|-\n|| Grey || style=\"background:white;\" | [[File:BJJ Grey Belt.svg|75px]]\n|-\n|| Yellow || style=\"background:white;\" | [[File:BJJ Yellow Belt.svg|75px]]\n|-\n|| Orange || style=\"background:white;\" | [[File:BJJ Orange Belt.svg|75px]]\n|-\n|| Green || style=\"background:white;\" | [[File:BJJ Green Belt.svg|75px]]\n|}\n\n{{Main|Brazilian jiu-jitsu ranking system|Gracie jiu-jitsu ranking system}}\nThe Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu ranking system awards a practitioner different colored belts to signify increasing levels of technical knowledge and practical skill. While the system's structure shares its origins with the [[Judo#Rank and grading|judo ranking system]] and the origins of all colored belts, it now contains many of its own unique aspects and themes. Some of these differences are relatively minor, such as the division between youth and adult belts and the stripe/degree system. Others are quite distinct and have become synonymous with the art, such as a marked informality in promotional criteria, including as a focus on a competitive demonstration of skill, and a conservative approach to promotion in general.<ref name=\"IBJJF Graduation System\">\n{{cite web |author=Camargo, Bruno |title= IBJJF Graduation system|url=http://www.ibjjf.org/graduation.htm |accessdate=October 13, 2009 }}</ref><ref name=\"Gracie1\">{{cite book| last = Gracie| first = Renzo | authorlink =Renzo Gracie | last2 =Gracie | first2 =Royler | author2-link =Royler Gracie| title = Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu: Theory and Technique| publisher = Invisible Cities Press Llc| year = 2001\n| page = 304| isbn =1-931229-08-2 }}</ref>\n\nTraditionally, the concept of competitive skill demonstration as a quickened and earned route of promotion holds true.<ref name=\"IBJJF Graduation System\"/><ref name=\"Gracie1\"/> Some schools have placed a green belt for adults between the white and blue belt ranks due to the long periods between advancement. In addition, the use of a grey belt has been instituted for many children's programs to signal progress between the white and yellow belt rankings.\n\nUnlike in some martial arts such as [[taekwondo]] and [[karate]], a [[Black belt (martial arts)|black belt]] in Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu commonly takes more than several years to earn, and the rank is generally considered expert level. The amount of time it takes to achieve the rank of black belt varies between the practitioner. Some notable individuals who had previous backgrounds in other martial arts have been promoted directly to black belt rank without going through any intermediate rank.<ref>{{cite web | url =http://www.bjjee.com/articles/16-jiu-jitsu-practitioners-that-were-promoted-straight-to-black-belt/ | title =16 Jiu-Jitsu Practitioners That Were Promoted Straight to Black Belt | date = 2015-10-14 | website =bjjee.com | access-date =2017-02-01}}</ref> Others have achieved the rank in relatively short timeframes.<ref>{{cite web | url =http://www.bjjee.com/articles/top-10-fastest-black-belt-promotions-in-brazilian-jiu-jitsu-history/ |last=Guillaume| first=Huni| title =Top 10 Fastest Black Belt Promotions in Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu History | date = 2015-09-10 | website =bjjee.com | access-date =2017-02-01}}</ref> Outside of exceptions such as these, the average timeframe is around 10 years with a consistent training schedule.<ref>{{cite AV media | people =[[F\u00e1bio Santos (fighter)|F\u00e1bio Santos]] | title =Passion makes him a champion | medium = | publisher = | location = | date =| url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFnnoBncArw&t=42s}}</ref> However, Ryron Gracie (grandson/grandnephew of founders [[H\u00e9lio Gracie|H\u00e9lio]] and [[Carlos Gracie]]) has stated that the average of 10\u201312 years is longer than necessary, suggesting that the [[ego (Freudian)|ego]] of the practitioner often hinders progress, and advancement to black belt should take 7 years.<ref>{{cite AV media | people =Ryron Gracie | title =Ryron Gracie of the legendary Gracie Clan | medium = | publisher =plugonetwo.com | location =[[Beverly Hills, California]] | date =March 2014| url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhYQcRfhLCw&t=22m10s}}</ref>\n{{clear}}\n\n== Federations ==\nSince its inception in Brazil, Jiu-Jitsu has had different registered federations and tournaments (some organizations illegitimately calling themselves federations). The first Jiu-Jitsu Federation was the [[Jiu-Jitsu Federation of Guanabara]], which has remained a regional federation of Rio de Janeiro, while many others were founded. Among the most prestigious of the many federations are the [[Sport Jiu Jitsu International Federation (SJJIF)]], a nonprofit organization with federations and tournaments around the globe with the mission of making Jiu-Jitsu an [[Olympic sport]], and the [[International Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu Federation]], a profit organization that hosts a number of tournaments.<ref name=ibjjf>{{Cite web |url=https://ibjjf.com/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=2019-01-14 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190115181958/https://ibjjf.com/ |archive-date=2019-01-15 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n== Tournaments ==\nWhile there are numerous local and regional tournaments administered regularly by private individuals and academies, there are two major entities in Jiu-Jitsu circles.  First, is the [[Sport Jiu Jitsu International Federation (SJJIF)]], a (nonprofit) organization with international federations and tournaments.  Second, is the [[International Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu Federation|International Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu Federation (IBJJF)]], a for-profit company that hosts a number of major tournaments worldwide. These include the [[Pan-American Championship (jiu-jitsu)|Pan American Championship]], [[European Championship (Brazilian jiu-jitsu)|European Championship]], and the [[Mundials]]. [[California]], [[New York (state)|New York]], and [[Texas]] are the three states in the US which host tournaments most frequently.  Other promotions within [[North America]], such as Battleground Grappling Championship, American Grappling Federation (AGF), North American BJJ Federation (NABJJF), and [[North American Grappling Association]] (NAGA) host tournaments nationwide, but visit these states multiple times within a tournament season.\n\nAnother tournament to spring from the founding Gracie lineage is the Gracie Nationals or Gracie Worlds. Founded in 2007 by Rose Gracie, daughter of [[Ultimate Fighting Championship]] creator and Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu grandmaster [[Rorion Gracie]]. Gracie Nationals/Worlds followed the guidelines of other major tournaments of the time, implementing a points systems\n\nIn 2012, the Gracie Worlds introduced a new submission-only format, removing certain judging systems that many interpreted as an outdated scoring system. Rose spoke about this change when she said, \"Today's tournaments aren't what my grandfather [Helio Gracie] envisioned. There's so many rules that it takes away from the actual art of Jiu-Jitsu. We don't see many submissions. We see cheating, we see decisions made by a referee. We need to stand together against this and support a submission only kind of revolution.\" Cheating in Jiu-Jitsu, Rose said, comes in many forms. \"[A competitor] will earn a point, then hold for the entire match so they can win with that one little advantage they got at the start,\" Rose said. \"That's not Jiu-Jitsu. That's cheating.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2012/writers/loretta_hunt/01/25/rose-gracie/ |title=Rose Gracie honors MMA roots with overhaul of Gracie U.S. Nationals \u2013 Loretta Hunt \u2013 SI.com |website=Sportsillustrated.cnn.com |date= |accessdate=2014-02-17}}</ref>\n\nThis discontent with points-based and advantage-style competition has been echoed throughout the Jiu-Jitsu community, leading to many prominent submission-only style events. At these events, the winner of a match is determined only by submission, and these tournaments at times have no time limit, or are timed with a result of double disqualification if there is no submission victory. This form of tournament have yet to become widespread. [[Metamoris]], a grappling competition event run by Rose's brother [[Ralek Gracie]], has helped advocate this tournament form. Another notable example of a submission-only format is the EBI ([[Eddie Bravo Invitational]]), which was the first televised event of its kind, and is now being featured on [[UFC Fight Pass]]. Other submission-only events have cropped up all over the world including TUFF invitational and Polaris Pro, and many others.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.attacktheback.com/polaris-3-the-aftermath/ |title=Polaris Pro - The Aftermath - Attack The Back |website=Attacktheback.com |date= 2016-04-03|accessdate=2016-05-17}}</ref>\n\nAt tournaments, especially those hosted by the [[International Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu Federation|International Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu Federation (IBJJF)]], some athletes engage in a practice called \"closing out.\"<ref name=\"graciemag.com\">{{Cite web | url=https://www.graciemag.com/en/2012/04/09/a-measure-for-quashing-closing-out-jiu-jitsu-finals/ |title = A measure for quashing closing out Jiu-Jitsu finals? &#124; Graciemag}}</ref> This occurs when two athletes, usually friends or members of the same team, meet in a match but refuse to fight. Tournament organizers can minimize the chance of close-outs by placing athletes from the same team on opposite sides of the bracket, a practice which makes the finals the only match in which they could possibly meet (assuming each team has no more than two competitors in a given bracket). When two athletes close out a match, they agree which one of them will technically forfeit to the other. As this most often occurs in the final matches of tournaments, this usually means deciding which of the two will win the gold medal and which will win the silver. Notable examples of closing out include Marcus \"Buchecha\" Almeida forfeiting the finals of the Absolute division at the 2018 IBJJF World Championship to his friend Leandro Lo, who had suffered a shoulder injury during a previous match,<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.bjjee.com/articles/buchecha-surrenders-title-leandro-lo-plus-results-worlds-2018/ | title=Buchecha Surrenders Title to Leandro Lo - Plus More Results from WORLDS 2018| date=2018-06-04}}</ref> and frequent close outs between the brothers Paulo and Joao Miyao, who often compete in the same weight division.<ref>https://www.flograppling.com/articles/5050610-how-the-miyao-brothers-embraced-the-bjj-lifestyle</ref> \nProponents of close-outs claim it fosters team unity and allows competitors to train as hard and as freely as they can with their teammates. They say that facing a teammate in a competition would make them hold back in training. Critics of the practice say it diminishes audience enjoyment of tournaments where it is allowed,<ref name=\"graciemag.com\"/> and some tournaments, notably the ADCC, ban it.<ref>https://www.instagram.com/p/BwWuBHBAVJJ/</ref>\n\n== Health considerations ==\n=== Safety ===\nBrazilian Jiu-Jitsu is one of the safest full contact martial arts for practitioners. Its injury rate is around 9.2-38.6 per 1000 athlete exposures.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Scoggin|first1=James F.|last2=Brusovanik|first2=Georgiy|last3=Izuka|first3=Byron H.|last4=Zandee van Rilland|first4=Eddy|last5=Geling|first5=Olga|last6=Tokumura|first6=Seren|title=Assessment of Injuries During Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu Competition|journal=Orthopaedic Journal of Sports Medicine|date=February 2014|volume=2|issue=2|pages=232596711452218|doi=10.1177/2325967114522184|pmid=26535299|pmc=4555620}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Kreiswirth|first1=Ethan M.|last2=Myer|first2=Gregory D.|last3=Rauh|first3=Mitchell J.|title=Incidence of Injury Among Male Brazilian Jiujitsu Fighters at the World Jiu-Jitsu No-Gi Championship 2009|journal=Journal of Athletic Training|date=January 2014|volume=49|issue=1|pages=89\u201394|doi=10.4085/1062-6050-49.1.11|pmc=3917302|pmid=24377959}}</ref> This is lower than in [[mixed martial arts]] (236-286 per 1000), [[boxing]] (210-420 per 1000), [[judo]] (25.3-130.6) and [[taekwondo]] (20.5-139.5). It is similar to [[wrestling]], which also uses grappling instead of striking. The few injuries that may be incurred in Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu usually affect the joints and rarely the head. The most common injuries Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu practitioners suffer from are [[ACL tear]]s in the knees, [[rotator cuff]] tears in the shoulders and [[spinal disc hernia]]tions, most commonly in the neck region. Many are repairable via surgery that require an extended rehab period before the athlete can return to BJJ training. Also many athletes suffer from minor injuries, such as elbow and wrist [[tendonitis]], due to overtraining and the grappling nature of the martial art, which can be strenuous and taxing for the joints and the tendons.\n\n=== Skin health ===\nBesides the normal strains and pulls associated with most martial arts, Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu practitioners (along with Wrestlers, Judoka, and other grapplers ) are exposed to regular skin abrasions and potential unsanitary mat conditions.  They are thus at higher risk for developing skin disease.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.uiowa.edu/~armbar/safety.htm |title=BJJ Safety |website=Uiowa.edu |date= |accessdate=2011-09-15 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111108182804/http://www.uiowa.edu/~armbar/safety.htm |archivedate=2011-11-08 |df= }}</ref>  Several commonly contracted skin diseases include [[Dermatophytosis|ringworm]], [[impetigo]], [[herpes gladiatorum]], and [[Staphylococcal infection|staph infection]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.grapplersquest.com/blogs/briancimins/grappling-tournament-health-warning-advisory-dirty-mats-nearly-caused-amputation-2 |title=Grappling Tournament Health Warning Advisory \u2013 Dirty Mats nearly caused AMPUTATION in 2009!!! |publisher=Grapplers Quest |date= |accessdate=2011-09-15}}</ref>  Proper hygiene practices, including regular cleaning of classroom mats, showering immediately after class with [[soap]], disinfecting and covering any open wounds, thorough cleaning of any [[Brazilian jiu-jitsu gi|gi]]/[[rashguard]]/[[Wrestling headgear|headgear]] used before the next class, not sharing used towels/uniforms, and using a [[barrier cream]] greatly reduces the chance of contracting a disease.\n\n=== Cauliflower ear ===\n[[File:Dom Cruz 2.png|thumb|Dominick Cruz's cauliflower ears]]\n\nDue to the use of the head to maintain position and attack in Jiu-Jitsu, the ears can easily be damaged and begin to swell.

In a 1994 interview with Yoshinori Nishi, H\u00e9lio Gracie said that he didn't even know the word of Judo itself until the sport came in the 1950s to Brazil, because he heard that Mitsuyo Maeda called his style \"Jiu-Jitsu\".\n\nThe art is sometimes referred to as Gracie Jiu-Jitsu (GJJ), a name [[trademark]]ed by [[Rorion Gracie]], but after a legal dispute with his cousin [[Carley Gracie]], his trademark to the name was voided.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://bulk.resource.org/courts.gov/c/F3/217/217.F3d.1060.98-16386.98-15672.html |title=Carley Gracie et al. v Rorion Gracie et al. \u2013 Docket Numbers 98-15672, 98-16386 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090522083358/http://bulk.resource.org/courts.gov/c/F3/217/217.F3d.1060.98-16386.98-15672.html |archive-date=2009-05-22 }} [[United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit]]</ref> Other members of the Gracie family often call their style by personalized names, such as Ceaser Gracie Jiu-Jitsu or Renzo Gracie Jiu-Jitsu, and similarly, the [[Machado family]] call their style Machado Jiu-Jitsu (MJJ).

Some of these rule changes sought to enhance it as a spectator sport, and others aimed to improve safety. Several of these rule changes de-emphasised the groundwork aspects of judo, and others have reduced the range of [[joint lock]]s application. Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu did not follow these changes to judo rules, and this divergence gave BJJ a distinct identity as a grappling art,<ref name=rules>[http://ibjjf.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/RulesIBJJF_v4_en-US.pdf \"IBJJF rules\"] ([[International Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu Federation]]), accessed April 3, 2008</ref> although it's still recognizably related to judo. Other factors that have contributed towards the stylistic divergence of BJJ from the sport judo include the Gracies' contribution to the art, including emphasis on full-contact fighting.\n\nBJJ permits the same techniques that judo allows when taking combat to the ground. These include judo's scoring [[throw (grappling)|throws]] as well as judo's non-scoring techniques that it refers to as \"skillful takedowns\" (such as the [[flying armbar]]). BJJ also allows any and all takedowns used in wrestling, sambo, or any other grappling arts including direct attempts to take down by touching the legs.

Sport BJJ tournaments continue to grow in popularity and have given rise to no-gi [[submission grappling]] tournaments, such as the [[ADCC Submission Wrestling World Championship]] and NAGA, the North American Grappling Association. Sport BJJ has also become a popular method of fitness around the world in recent years.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://pridegym.ca/classes-item/brazilian-jiu-jitsu/|title=Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu|website=Pride Gym Martial Arts|language=en-US|access-date=2019-06-28}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://championscreed.ca/wiki/BrazilianJiuJitsu/BrazilianJiuJitsuTrial|title=Brazilian Jiu Jitsu Trial|website=championscreed.ca|language=en|access-date=2019-06-28}}</ref>\n\n== Style of fighting ==\n{{see also|List of Brazilian jiu-jitsu techniques}}\n{{More citations needed section|date=January 2016}}\n\nBrazilian Jiu-Jitsu focuses on getting an opponent to the ground in order to neutralize possible strength or size advantages through [[ground fighting]] techniques and [[submission holds]] involving [[joint-locks]] and [[chokehold]]s. On the ground, physical strength can be offset or enhanced through proper grappling techniques.\n\nBJJ employs a wide range of takedown techniques to bring an opponent to the ground such as \"[[Guard (grappling)#Pulling Guard|pulling guard]]\", which is not used in other combat sports such as Judo or Wrestling. Once the opponent is on the ground, a number of maneuvers (and counter-maneuvers) are available to manipulate the opponent into a suitable position for the application of a submission technique. Achieving a dominant position on the ground is one of the hallmarks of BJJ, which includes effective use of the [[Guard (grappling)|guard]] position to defend oneself from bottom (using both submissions and sweeps, with sweeps leading to the possibility of dominant position or an opportunity to pass the guard), and passing the guard to dominate from top position with [[side control]], [[Mount (grappling)|mount]], and [[back mount]] positions. This system of maneuvering and manipulation can be likened to a form of kinetic or physical chess when executed by two experienced practitioners.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cnbc.com/2018/12/05/ex-navy-seal-commander-heres-why-so-many-smart-people-practicebrazilian-jiu-jitsu.html|title=Ex-Navy SEAL commander: Here's why so many smart people practice Brazilian jiu-jitsu|first=Zameena|last=Mejia|date=5 December 2018|website=Cnbc.com}}</ref> A submission hold in BJJ is often assimilated to the equivalent of \"checkmate\", where the opponent is left with no other option but to tap, be injured, or choked.\n\n[[Renzo Gracie]] wrote in his book ''Mastering JUJITSU'':\n\n{{quote|\"The classical jujutsu of old Japan appeared to have no common strategy to guide a combatant over the course of a fight. Indeed, this was one of Kano's most fundamental and perceptive criticisms of the classical program.\" Maeda not only taught the art of judo to [[Carlos Gracie]], but also taught a particular philosophy about the nature of combat developed by Kano, and further refined by Maeda based on his worldwide travels competing against fighters skilled in a wide variety of martial arts.<ref name=\"renzog1\">{{cite book\n| last = Gracie\n| first = Renzo\n| authorlink =\n| title = Mastering Jiu-jitsu\n| publisher = Human Kinetics\n| year = 2003\n| pages = 1\u2013233\n| isbn = 0-7360-4404-3\n}}</ref>}}\n\nThe book details Maeda's theory as arguing that physical combat could be broken down into distinct phases, such as the striking phase, the grappling phase, the ground phase, etc. Thus, it was a smart fighter's task to keep the fight located in the phase of combat best suited to his own strengths. Renzo Gracie stated that this was a fundamental influence of the Gracie approach to combat. These strategies were further developed over time by the Gracies and others, and became prominent in contemporary MMA.\n\n=== Ground fighting ===\n[[File:Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu Demonstration.ogv|thumb|right|A demonstration of Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu during a class at Standard BJJ in Rockville, MD.]]\nBJJ is mainly differentiated from other martial arts by its greater emphasis on ground fighting. Commonly, striking-based martial arts place little to no emphasis on groundwork. BJJ also places little emphasis on standing techniques, such as [[Strike (attack)|striking]] and [[Throw (grappling)|throws]], although it employs some basic [[Takedown (grappling)|takedowns]], such as [[Single leg takedown|single]] and [[double leg takedown]]s, and some BJJ clubs and practitioners [[cross-training|cross train]] with [[wrestling]], judo, and [[Sambo (martial art)|sambo]].\n\n=== Training methods ===\n[[File:Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu strengthens camaraderie, build trust at Camp Lemonnier 140727-F-SJ695-033.jpg|thumb|A Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu instructor gently demonstrates how to tackle an opponent.]]\nBJJ focuses on submissions without the use of [[Strike (attack)|strikes]], while training allows practitioners to practice at full speed and with full strength, resembling the effort used in competition. Training methods include technique drills in which techniques are practiced against a non-resisting partner; isolation sparring (commonly referred to as positional drilling) where only a certain technique or sets of techniques are used; and full sparring where each practitioner tries to submit their opponent through technique. Physical conditioning is also an important aspect of training.\n\nThe [[Gracie family]] lineage descended from Helio Gracie focuses on practical applications of BJJ that apply primarily to self-defense.<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxlW9dmsPJs Carlos Sr. vs Helio: The Truth About the Gracie Family History and Politics ] Kama Jiu-Jitsu, August 14, 2017</ref> They will often run development drills in which a person is surrounded by a circle of other students who will attempt to attack the defending student, who in turn must defend themselves using techniques.

These positions provide different submission or transition options.\n\n=== Side control ===\n{{Main|Side control}}\n[[File:Udegarami.JPG|thumb|An \"americana\" or \"paintbrush\" submission from traditional [[side control]]]]\n\nIn side control, the practitioner pins his opponent to the ground from the side of their torso. The top grappler lies across the opponent with weight applied to the opponent's chest. The opponent may be further controlled by pressure on either side of the shoulders and hips from the practitioner's elbows, shoulders, and knees. A wide variety of submissions can be initiated from side control. It is also referred to as the side mount. Additionally, the typical side mount increases opportunity for the top grappler to advance to other dominant positions. This position is often used in MMA as it allows the top fighter to strike whilst overcoming their opponents defence. Variants of the side control include Twister Side Control (popularized by [[Eddie Bravo]]), Brazilian Crossbody, [[kesa gatame]], \"Wrestler Pin\", knee mount, and other positions.<ref>{{cite web|last=Patterson|first=Jeff|title=Know Your Cross-Body Pins|url=http://nwfighting.com/know-your-jiu-jitsu-positions-cross-body-pins.html/|work=nwfighting.com|publisher=Northwest Fighting Arts|accessdate=10 March 2014}}</ref>\n\n=== Full mount ===\n{{Main|Mount (grappling)}}\n[[File:Andrea Galvao.jpg|thumb|left|[[Mount (grappling)|Full Mount]] is considered one of the most dominant [[grappling position]]s.]]\n\nIn the mount (or full mount) position, the practitioner sits astride the opponent's front torso or chest, controlling the opponent with his bodyweight and hips. In the strongest form of this position, the practitioner works his knees into the opponent's armpits to reduce arm movements and ability to move or counter submission attempts. Full Mount can be used to apply a variety of submissions including armlocks or chokes.\n\n=== Back mount ===\n{{Main|Back mount}}\n[[File:Back mount.jpg|thumb|Back mount, also considered one of the most dominant positions in BJJ]]\n\nWhen taking the back mount position (often known in Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu as the ''back grab'' or ''attacking the back''), the practitioner attaches to the back of the opponent by wrapping his legs around and hooking the opponent's thighs with their heel,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://ibjjf.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/RulesIBJJF_v4_en-US.pdf |title=International Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu Federation \u2013 Rule Book |work =Official IFBJJ rules, see Article 5 \u2013 Fighting Conclusions, The order of the referee, subsection \u2013 E |accessdate=June 10, 2010}}</ref> or locking in a body triangle by crossing one shin across the waist like a belt then placing the back of the opposing knee over the instep as if finishing a triangle choke. Simultaneously, the upper body is controlled by wrapping the arms around the chest or neck of the opponent. This position is often used to apply [[chokeholds]], as well as arm bars and triangles, and neutralizes an opponent's potential size or strength advantage.\n\n=== North South position ===\nThe North South position occurs when a practitioner is lying on their back on the ground and their opponent is lying on top, with the head over the chest area and controlling the bottom practitioner's arms. As with most top controlling positions in BJJ, the top practitioner applies pressure by bringing their hips downwards towards the ground, generating what is referred to as ''deadweight''. There are several submissions and transitions that are possible from the North South position, most commonly the North South choke, North South [[Kimura lock|kimura]], and others.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://bjj-world.com/bjj-north-south-position-attacks/|title=Versatile Attacks From The BJJ North-South Position|first=Ognen|last=Dzabirski|date=26 March 2018|website=Bjj-world.com|accessdate=5 March 2019}}</ref>\n\n=== Guards ===\n{{Main|Guard (grappling)}}\n[[File:Brazilian Jiu-jitsu-Closed guard.jpg|thumb|left|The Jiu-Jitsu practitioner in blue is demonstrating a type of closed [[Guard (grappling)|guard]]]]\n\nWhen in the \"Guard\" position, the practitioner is on their back controlling an opponent with his legs. The bottom practitioner pushes and pulls with the legs or feet to unbalance and limit the movements of his opponent. This position allows practitioners a wide variety of counter-attacks from the bottom position, including submissions and sweeps.\n\nThe three most common types of guards include the Closed Guard, Half Guard, and Open Guard.\n\nIn closed guard, the bottom grappler has his legs around the opponent's hips, with ankles closed together to control their opponent. The closed guard can be an effective position. This guard allows many setups for submissions such as jointlocks and chokes, as well as sweeps. In the open guard, the legs are not hooked together and the bottom grappler uses his legs or feet to push or pull their opponent.\n\nThere are many variations of open guard with distinct names and positioning including the Butterfly Guard, De La Riva Guard, X-Guard, Rubber guard, Spider Guard, Octopus Guard, Lapel Guard, Worm Guard (made popular by [[Keenan Cornelius]]) and others. Butterfly guard is when the bottom grappler brings his legs up and feet together against the inner thighs of top opponent. The name is derived from the resulting butterfly wing shape. Butterfly guard increases both space to maneuver and the ability counter the opponent with the shins or arches of the feet against the competitor's inner thighs.\n\nIn the half guard, one of the top grappler's legs is controlled by the bottom grappler's legs, preventing the top opponent from passing side control or full mount positions.  There is also a variant of half guard called \"50/50 guard\", which consist of each opponent usually in sitting positions with one of their legs hooking the same leg of their opponent in a mirrored fashion. This position is called 50/50 because neither opponent has a distinct advantage, where both sides have the same possibilities of sweeps and attacks.\n\nAnother variation of the half guard position is the \"deep half guard\", which involves the bottom grappler positioning themselves underneath their opponent, grabbing the top grappler's thigh. This gives the individual on the bottom the opportunity to sweep their opponent, and end up on a more dominant, top position. This position was popularized by American BJJ Black Belt, [[Jeff Glover]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://wbbjj.com/uncle-richard-guard/|title=Having Problems Understanding Deep Half Guard? Jeff Glover Presents \"Uncle Richard Guard\".|date=2017-04-13|work=White Belt Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu|access-date=2018-09-18|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\n== Submissions ==\n\n{{For|a list of list of Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu techniques|List of Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu techniques}}\n\nThe majority of submission holds can be grouped into two broad categories: [[joint lock]]s and [[chokehold|chokes]]. Joint locks typically involve isolating an opponent's limb and creating a lever with the body position, which will force the joint to move past its normal range of motion.<ref name=\"mma\"/> Pressure is increased in a controlled manner and released if the opponent cannot escape the hold and signals defeat by [[Submission (combat sport)|tapping]]. A choke hold can disrupt the blood supply to the brain and cause unconsciousness if the opponent does not tap when required.\n\n=== Compression locks ===\n\n''See also'' [[Compression lock]]\n\nA less common type of submission hold is a [[compression lock]], where the muscle of an opponent is compressed against a hard, large bone (commonly the shin or wrist), causing significant pain to the opponent. These types of locks are not usually allowed in competition due to the high risk of tearing muscle tissue. This type of lock also often hyper-extends the joint in the opposite direction, pulling it apart. Some compression locks include the [[Compression lock#Achilles lock|Achilles lock]], [[Compression lock#Biceps slicer|Bicep slicer]], and [[Compression lock#Leg slicer|Leg slicer]] (or Calf slicer).\n\n=== Joint locks ===\n[[File:In-guard armbar.jpg|thumb|upright|left|A practitioner attempting an [[armbar]] submission]]\n\nWhile many joint locks are permitted in BJJ, most competitions ban or restrict some or all joint locks that involve the knees, ankles, and spine. The reason for this is that the angles of manipulation required to cause pain are nearly the same as those that would cause serious injury. Joint locks that require a twisting motion of the knee (such as heel hooks or knee bars) are usually banned in competitions because successfully completing the move can frequently result in permanent damage, often requiring surgery. Similarly, [[Neck Crank|joint manipulations of the spine]] are typically barred due to the inherent danger of crushing or misaligning [[cervical vertebrae]]. Leglocks are allowed in varying degrees depending on skill level, with the most prominent BJJ tournaments typically allowing only the straight ankle lock and muscle stretching submissions such as the \"banana split\" from white through purple belt, with the kneebar, toehold, and calf slicer submissions being permitted at brown and black belt. Most competitions do not allow [[heel hooks]], which are considered to be exceptionally dangerous.<ref name=USGR/><ref>{{cite web|author=Eric Pearch |url=http://www.couch2cage.com/taboo-techniques-the-heel-hook-in-bjj-and-mma/ |title=Taboo techniques |website=Couch2cage.com |date=2010-11-16 |accessdate=2014-02-17}}</ref> However, most joint locks involving the wrist, elbow, shoulder or ankle are permitted as there is a great deal more flexibility in those joints and those locks are usually safe.\n\nJoint locks include armbars, kimuras, Americanas, straight-arm lock, omoplata, marceloplata, banana split (or electric chair), twister, wrist lock, heel hook, toehold, kneebar, straight ankle lock, and others.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bjjtech.com/tech/tech-list.asp?id=3&sub=y&name=Submissions|title=BJJ Technique Catalog: Category: Submissions|work=bjjtech.com}}</ref>\n\n=== Chokes ===\n[[File:MCMAP Rear choke - Defense Visual Information Center 2006.jpg|upright|thumb|A [[rear naked choke]], as demonstrated by a [[MCMAP]] instructor]]\n[[Chokehold|Chokes]] are common forms of submission. In BJJ, the chokes that are used put pressure on the [[carotid]] arteries, and may also apply pressure to the nerve [[baroreceptor]]s in the neck. This kind of choke is very fast acting (if done properly) with victims typically losing consciousness in around 3\u20135 seconds. In contrast, an air choke (involving constriction of the [[windpipe]]) can take up to two minutes, depending on how long the person can hold their breath, and may cause serious damage to the throat.\n\nChokes include [[rear-naked choke]], [[Sankaku-jime|triangle]], [[Okuri eri jime|bow and arrow choke]], [[Sode guruma jime|sleeve choke]] (or Ezekiel choke), guillotine, cross collar choke (or X choke), [[Kata juji jime#variants|baseball choke]], D'Arce, clock choke, [[Arm triangle choke]], north\u2013south choke, crucifix choke, anaconda choke, [[Gogoplata]], loop choke, and others.\n\n== Uniform ==\n{{Main|Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu gi}}\nThe Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu practitioner's uniform (commonly referred to using the Japanese terms ''[[Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu gi|gi]]'' or ''[[kimono]]'') is similar to a [[judogi]], but often made of lighter material with tighter cuffs on the pants and jacket. This allows the practitioner to benefit from a closer fit, providing less material for an opponent to manipulate, although there is a significant overlap in the standards that allows for a carefully selected gi to be legal for competition in both styles. Traditionally, to be [[Brazilian jiu-jitsu ranking system|promoted]] in Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, the wearing of the Jiu-Jitsu gi while training is a requirement. Recently with the growing popularity of \"no-gi\" Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, the practice of giving out belts to no gi practitioners (e.g., [[Rolles Gracie]] awarding [[Rashad Evans]] a black belt) has become more common.\n{{clear}}\n\n== Grading ==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"float:right; text-align:center;\"\n|+Black belt grades<br />(19 and over)\n|-\n|| Black 0\u20136 || style=\"background:white;\" | [[File:BJJ BlackBelt.svg|75px]]\n|-\n|| Black/Red 7 || style=\"background:white;\" | [[File:BJJ black red belt.svg|75px]]\n|-\n|| Red/White 8 || style=\"background:white;\" | [[File:BJJ red white belt.svg|75px]]\n|-\n|| Red 9\u201310 || style=\"background:white;\" | [[File:BJJ Red Belt.svg|75px]]\n|}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"float:right; text-align:center;\"\n|+Senior belt colors<br />(16 and over)\n|-\n|| White || style=\"brackground:white;\" | [[File:BJJ White Belt.svg|75px]]\n|-\n|| Blue || style=\"background:white;\" | [[File:BJJ Blue Belt.svg|75px]]\n|-\n|| Purple || style=\"background:white;\" | [[File:BJJ Purple Belt.svg|75px]]\n|-\n|| Brown || style=\"background:white;\" | [[File:BJJ Brown Belt.svg|75px]]\n|}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"float:right; text-align:center;\"\n|+Junior belt colours<br />(16 and under)\n|-\n|| White || style=\"background:white;\" | [[File:BJJ White Belt.svg|75px]]\n|-\n|| Grey || style=\"background:white;\" | [[File:BJJ Grey Belt.svg|75px]]\n|-\n|| Yellow || style=\"background:white;\" | [[File:BJJ Yellow Belt.svg|75px]]\n|-\n|| Orange || style=\"background:white;\" | [[File:BJJ Orange Belt.svg|75px]]\n|-\n|| Green || style=\"background:white;\" | [[File:BJJ Green Belt.svg|75px]]\n|}\n\n{{Main|Brazilian jiu-jitsu ranking system|Gracie jiu-jitsu ranking system}}\nThe Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu ranking system awards a practitioner different colored belts to signify increasing levels of technical knowledge and practical skill. While the system's structure shares its origins with the [[Judo#Rank and grading|judo ranking system]] and the origins of all colored belts, it now contains many of its own unique aspects and themes. Some of these differences are relatively minor, such as the division between youth and adult belts and the stripe/degree system. Others are quite distinct and have become synonymous with the art, such as a marked informality in promotional criteria, including as a focus on a competitive demonstration of skill, and a conservative approach to promotion in general.<ref name=\"IBJJF Graduation System\">\n{{cite web |author=Camargo, Bruno |title= IBJJF Graduation system|url=http://www.ibjjf.org/graduation.htm |accessdate=October 13, 2009 }}</ref><ref name=\"Gracie1\">{{cite book| last = Gracie| first = Renzo | authorlink =Renzo Gracie | last2 =Gracie | first2 =Royler | author2-link =Royler Gracie| title = Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu: Theory and Technique| publisher = Invisible Cities Press Llc| year = 2001\n| page = 304| isbn =1-931229-08-2 }}</ref>\n\nTraditionally, the concept of competitive skill demonstration as a quickened and earned route of promotion holds true.<ref name=\"IBJJF Graduation System\"/><ref name=\"Gracie1\"/> Some schools have placed a green belt for adults between the white and blue belt ranks due to the long periods between advancement. In addition, the use of a grey belt has been instituted for many children's programs to signal progress between the white and yellow belt rankings.\n\nUnlike in some martial arts such as [[taekwondo]] and [[karate]], a [[Black belt (martial arts)|black belt]] in Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu commonly takes more than several years to earn, and the rank is generally considered expert level. The amount of time it takes to achieve the rank of black belt varies between the practitioner. Some notable individuals who had previous backgrounds in other martial arts have been promoted directly to black belt rank without going through any intermediate rank.<ref>{{cite web | url =http://www.bjjee.com/articles/16-jiu-jitsu-practitioners-that-were-promoted-straight-to-black-belt/ | title =16 Jiu-Jitsu Practitioners That Were Promoted Straight to Black Belt | date = 2015-10-14 | website =bjjee.com | access-date =2017-02-01}}</ref> Others have achieved the rank in relatively short timeframes.<ref>{{cite web | url =http://www.bjjee.com/articles/top-10-fastest-black-belt-promotions-in-brazilian-jiu-jitsu-history/ |last=Guillaume| first=Huni| title =Top 10 Fastest Black Belt Promotions in Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu History | date = 2015-09-10 | website =bjjee.com | access-date =2017-02-01}}</ref> Outside of exceptions such as these, the average timeframe is around 10 years with a consistent training schedule.<ref>{{cite AV media | people =[[F\u00e1bio Santos (fighter)|F\u00e1bio Santos]] | title =Passion makes him a champion | medium = | publisher = | location = | date =| url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFnnoBncArw&t=42s}}</ref> However, Ryron Gracie (grandson/grandnephew of founders [[H\u00e9lio Gracie|H\u00e9lio]] and [[Carlos Gracie]]) has stated that the average of 10\u201312 years is longer than necessary, suggesting that the [[ego (Freudian)|ego]] of the practitioner often hinders progress, and advancement to black belt should take 7 years.<ref>{{cite AV media | people =Ryron Gracie | title =Ryron Gracie of the legendary Gracie Clan | medium = | publisher =plugonetwo.com | location =[[Beverly Hills, California]] | date =March 2014| url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhYQcRfhLCw&t=22m10s}}</ref>\n{{clear}}\n\n== Federations ==\nSince its inception in Brazil, Jiu-Jitsu has had different registered federations and tournaments (some organizations illegitimately calling themselves federations). The first Jiu-Jitsu Federation was the [[Jiu-Jitsu Federation of Guanabara]], which has remained a regional federation of Rio de Janeiro, while many others were founded. Among the most prestigious of the many federations are the [[Sport Jiu Jitsu International Federation (SJJIF)]], a nonprofit organization with federations and tournaments around the globe with the mission of making Jiu-Jitsu an [[Olympic sport]], and the [[International Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu Federation]], a profit organization that hosts a number of tournaments.<ref name=ibjjf>{{Cite web |url=https://ibjjf.com/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=2019-01-14 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190115181958/https://ibjjf.com/ |archive-date=2019-01-15 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n== Tournaments ==\nWhile there are numerous local and regional tournaments administered regularly by private individuals and academies, there are two major entities in Jiu-Jitsu circles.  First, is the [[Sport Jiu Jitsu International Federation (SJJIF)]], a (nonprofit) organization with international federations and tournaments.  Second, is the [[International Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu Federation|International Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu Federation (IBJJF)]], a for-profit company that hosts a number of major tournaments worldwide. These include the [[Pan-American Championship (jiu-jitsu)|Pan American Championship]], [[European Championship (Brazilian jiu-jitsu)|European Championship]], and the [[Mundials]]. [[California]], [[New York (state)|New York]], and [[Texas]] are the three states in the US which host tournaments most frequently.  Other promotions within [[North America]], such as Battleground Grappling Championship, American Grappling Federation (AGF), North American BJJ Federation (NABJJF), and [[North American Grappling Association]] (NAGA) host tournaments nationwide, but visit these states multiple times within a tournament season.\n\nAnother tournament to spring from the founding Gracie lineage is the Gracie Nationals or Gracie Worlds. Founded in 2007 by Rose Gracie, daughter of [[Ultimate Fighting Championship]] creator and Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu grandmaster [[Rorion Gracie]]. Gracie Nationals/Worlds followed the guidelines of other major tournaments of the time, implementing a points systems\n\nIn 2012, the Gracie Worlds introduced a new submission-only format, removing certain judging systems that many interpreted as an outdated scoring system. Rose spoke about this change when she said, \"Today's tournaments aren't what my grandfather [Helio Gracie] envisioned. There's so many rules that it takes away from the actual art of Jiu-Jitsu. We don't see many submissions. We see cheating, we see decisions made by a referee. We need to stand together against this and support a submission only kind of revolution.\" Cheating in Jiu-Jitsu, Rose said, comes in many forms. \"[A competitor] will earn a point, then hold for the entire match so they can win with that one little advantage they got at the start,\" Rose said. \"That's not Jiu-Jitsu. That's cheating.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2012/writers/loretta_hunt/01/25/rose-gracie/ |title=Rose Gracie honors MMA roots with overhaul of Gracie U.S. Nationals \u2013 Loretta Hunt \u2013 SI.com |website=Sportsillustrated.cnn.com |date= |accessdate=2014-02-17}}</ref>\n\nThis discontent with points-based and advantage-style competition has been echoed throughout the Jiu-Jitsu community, leading to many prominent submission-only style events. At these events, the winner of a match is determined only by submission, and these tournaments at times have no time limit, or are timed with a result of double disqualification if there is no submission victory. This form of tournament have yet to become widespread. [[Metamoris]], a grappling competition event run by Rose's brother [[Ralek Gracie]], has helped advocate this tournament form. Another notable example of a submission-only format is the EBI ([[Eddie Bravo Invitational]]), which was the first televised event of its kind, and is now being featured on [[UFC Fight Pass]]. Other submission-only events have cropped up all over the world including TUFF invitational and Polaris Pro, and many others.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.attacktheback.com/polaris-3-the-aftermath/ |title=Polaris Pro - The Aftermath - Attack The Back |website=Attacktheback.com |date= 2016-04-03|accessdate=2016-05-17}}</ref>\n\nAt tournaments, especially those hosted by the [[International Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu Federation|International Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu Federation (IBJJF)]], some athletes engage in a practice called \"closing out.\"<ref name=\"graciemag.com\">{{Cite web | url=https://www.graciemag.com/en/2012/04/09/a-measure-for-quashing-closing-out-jiu-jitsu-finals/ |title = A measure for quashing closing out Jiu-Jitsu finals? &#124; Graciemag}}</ref> This occurs when two athletes, usually friends or members of the same team, meet in a match but refuse to fight. Tournament organizers can minimize the chance of close-outs by placing athletes from the same team on opposite sides of the bracket, a practice which makes the finals the only match in which they could possibly meet (assuming each team has no more than two competitors in a given bracket). When two athletes close out a match, they agree which one of them will technically forfeit to the other. As this most often occurs in the final matches of tournaments, this usually means deciding which of the two will win the gold medal and which will win the silver. Notable examples of closing out include Marcus \"Buchecha\" Almeida forfeiting the finals of the Absolute division at the 2018 IBJJF World Championship to his friend Leandro Lo, who had suffered a shoulder injury during a previous match,<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.bjjee.com/articles/buchecha-surrenders-title-leandro-lo-plus-results-worlds-2018/ | title=Buchecha Surrenders Title to Leandro Lo - Plus More Results from WORLDS 2018| date=2018-06-04}}</ref> and frequent close outs between the brothers Paulo and Joao Miyao, who often compete in the same weight division.<ref>https://www.flograppling.com/articles/5050610-how-the-miyao-brothers-embraced-the-bjj-lifestyle</ref> \nProponents of close-outs claim it fosters team unity and allows competitors to train as hard and as freely as they can with their teammates. They say that facing a teammate in a competition would make them hold back in training. Critics of the practice say it diminishes audience enjoyment of tournaments where it is allowed,<ref name=\"graciemag.com\"/> and some tournaments, notably the ADCC, ban it.<ref>https://www.instagram.com/p/BwWuBHBAVJJ/</ref>\n\n== Health considerations ==\n=== Safety ===\nBrazilian Jiu-Jitsu is one of the safest full contact martial arts for practitioners. Its injury rate is around 9.2-38.6 per 1000 athlete exposures.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Scoggin|first1=James F.|last2=Brusovanik|first2=Georgiy|last3=Izuka|first3=Byron H.|last4=Zandee van Rilland|first4=Eddy|last5=Geling|first5=Olga|last6=Tokumura|first6=Seren|title=Assessment of Injuries During Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu Competition|journal=Orthopaedic Journal of Sports Medicine|date=February 2014|volume=2|issue=2|pages=232596711452218|doi=10.1177/2325967114522184|pmid=26535299|pmc=4555620}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Kreiswirth|first1=Ethan M.|last2=Myer|first2=Gregory D.|last3=Rauh|first3=Mitchell J.|title=Incidence of Injury Among Male Brazilian Jiujitsu Fighters at the World Jiu-Jitsu No-Gi Championship 2009|journal=Journal of Athletic Training|date=January 2014|volume=49|issue=1|pages=89\u201394|doi=10.4085/1062-6050-49.1.11|pmc=3917302|pmid=24377959}}</ref> This is lower than in [[mixed martial arts]] (236-286 per 1000), [[boxing]] (210-420 per 1000), [[judo]] (25.3-130.6) and [[taekwondo]] (20.5-139.5). It is similar to [[wrestling]], which also uses grappling instead of striking. The few injuries that may be incurred in Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu usually affect the joints and rarely the head. The most common injuries Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu practitioners suffer from are [[ACL tear]]s in the knees, [[rotator cuff]] tears in the shoulders and [[spinal disc hernia]]tions, most commonly in the neck region. Many are repairable via surgery that require an extended rehab period before the athlete can return to BJJ training. Also many athletes suffer from minor injuries, such as elbow and wrist [[tendonitis]], due to overtraining and the grappling nature of the martial art, which can be strenuous and taxing for the joints and the tendons.\n\n=== Skin health ===\nBesides the normal strains and pulls associated with most martial arts, Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu practitioners (along with Wrestlers, Judoka, and other grapplers ) are exposed to regular skin abrasions and potential unsanitary mat conditions.  They are thus at higher risk for developing skin disease.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.uiowa.edu/~armbar/safety.htm |title=BJJ Safety |website=Uiowa.edu |date= |accessdate=2011-09-15 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111108182804/http://www.uiowa.edu/~armbar/safety.htm |archivedate=2011-11-08 |df= }}</ref>  Several commonly contracted skin diseases include [[Dermatophytosis|ringworm]], [[impetigo]], [[herpes gladiatorum]], and [[Staphylococcal infection|staph infection]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.grapplersquest.com/blogs/briancimins/grappling-tournament-health-warning-advisory-dirty-mats-nearly-caused-amputation-2 |title=Grappling Tournament Health Warning Advisory \u2013 Dirty Mats nearly caused AMPUTATION in 2009!!! |publisher=Grapplers Quest |date= |accessdate=2011-09-15}}</ref>  Proper hygiene practices, including regular cleaning of classroom mats, showering immediately after class with [[soap]], disinfecting and covering any open wounds, thorough cleaning of any [[Brazilian jiu-jitsu gi|gi]]/[[rashguard]]/[[Wrestling headgear|headgear]] used before the next class, not sharing used towels/uniforms, and using a [[barrier cream]] greatly reduces the chance of contracting a disease.\n\n=== Cauliflower ear ===\n[[File:Dom Cruz 2.png|thumb|Dominick Cruz's cauliflower ears]]\n\nDue to the use of the head to maintain position and attack in Jiu-Jitsu, the ears can easily be damaged and begin to swell.  Without immediate medical treatment, the cartilage in a swollen ear will separate from the [[perichondrium]] that supplies its nutrients and will become permanently swollen/deformed ([[cauliflower ear]]). [[Wrestling headgear]] is sometimes used for prevention of this condition. Treatment includes draining the hematoma or surgery.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.grapplearts.com/Cauliflower-Ears-In-Brazilian-jiu-jitsu.html |title=Cauliflower ears in Grappling |website=Grapplearts.com |date= |accessdate=2011-09-15}}</ref>\n\n=== Performance-enhancing drugs ===\nThe practice of taking [[performance-enhancing drugs]], including [[Ergogenic use of anabolic steroids|anabolic steroids]], is believed to be relatively commonplace among competitors in Jiu-Jitsu tournaments and has sparked letters and public statements by some of Jiu-Jitsu's top competitors, including [[Rodrigo Medeiros|Comprido]] and [[Caio Terra]].<ref>{{cite web |author=: Equipe Brasa : : Brasa team : Brazilian Jiu Jitu |url=http://brasa.brazilianblackbelt.com/2011/05/comprido-felipe-costa-and-caio-terra-united-against-steroids-in-bjj/ |title=Black belts united against steroids in BJJ.
