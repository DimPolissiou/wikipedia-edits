The system is a division of the [[Metropolitan Council]], the region's [[metropolitan planning organization]] (MPO), averaging 264,347 riders each weekday, carrying 90% to 95% of the transit riders in the region on a combined network of regular-route [[bus]]es, [[light rail]] and [[commuter rail]].<ref name=\"about\"/> The remainder of Twin Cities transit ridership is generally split among suburban \u201copt-out\u201d carriers operating out of cities that have chosen not to participate in the Metro Transit network. The biggest opt-out providers are [[Minnesota Valley Transit Authority]] (MVTA), [[Maple Grove Transit]] and [[Southwest Transit]] (SW Transit). The [[University of Minnesota]] also operates a [[University of Minnesota Campus Shuttle|campus shuttle system]] that coordinates routes with Metro Transit services.\n\nIn 2017, buses carried about 68% of the system's passengers. Just above 16% of ridership was concentrated on Metro Transit's busiest route, the [[Green Line (Minnesota)|Green Line]] light rail. The region's other light rail line, the [[Blue Line (Minnesota)|Blue Line]], fell close behind, carrying 13% of Metro Transit passengers. Nearly 2% rode the [[A Line (Minnesota)|A Line]] arterial rapid bus line. The remaining approximately 1% rode the [[Northstar Commuter Rail]] service.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.metrotransit.org/rail-lines-set-records-as-metro-transit-ridership-tops-819-million-in-2017|title=Rail lines set records as Metro Transit ridership tops 81.9 million in 2017 - Metro Transit|website=www.metrotransit.org|language=en|access-date=2018-05-11}}</ref> In 2015, Metro Transit saw its highest yearly ridership ever, with a total of 85.8 million trips, 62.1 million (72%) of which were on buses.

The agency also contracts with private providers such as [[First Transit]] to offer paratansit services which operate under the Metro Mobility brand.\n\n==History==\nThe agency was established by the [[Minnesota State Legislature]] in 1967 as the '''Metropolitan Transit Commission''' ('''MTC''').<ref>Christopher, Mary Kay. Bus Transit Service in Land Development Planning. Transportation Research Board, 2006.</ref> MTC's operations were moved under the auspices of the [[Metropolitan Council]] in 1994, prompting a name change to \u201cMetropolitan Council Transit Operations\u201d and then, in 1998, to Metro Transit. The organization traces its history back to the 19th-century [[streetcar]] systems of the region through the acquisition in 1970 of the [[Twin City Rapid Transit|Twin City Lines]] bus system from businessman [[Carl Pohlad]]. At the time of the acquisition, Twin City Lines had 635 buses: 75% of those were over 15 years old and 86 buses were so old that they were banned from operating in Minneapolis. MTC acquired 465 new buses over the next five years and built many new bus shelters.<ref name=\"met-council-40\">{{cite web|url=http://www.metrocouncil.org/about/metcouncilhistory.pdf|title=A bold experiment: the Metropolitan Council at 40|publisher=Metropolitan Council|accessdate=December 16, 2009|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100613070633/http://metrocouncil.org/about/MetCouncilHistory.pdf|archivedate=June 13, 2010}}</ref>\n\nShortly thereafter, a long battle began to return rail transit to the region and efforts for additional lines continue at a snail's pace. It took 32 years to see the first line implemented. In 1972, the Regional Fixed Guideway Study for MTC proposed a $1.3 billion 37- or 57-mile (sources differ) [[Heavy rail#Heavy rail|heavy-rail]] [[rapid transit]] system, but the then-separate Metropolitan Council disagreed with that idea\u2014refusing to even look at the plan\u2014and continuing political battles prevented its implementation. The Met Council had its own plans for [[bus rapid transit]] in the Cities. Another system using smaller [[people mover]]s was proposed in the 1975 Small Vehicle Fixed Guideway Study and gained the most traction with the [[Saint Paul, Minnesota|Saint Paul]] city council, but was eventually dropped in 1980. In the 1980s, [[light rail]] was proposed as an alternative and several possible corridors were identified, including the [[Green Line (Minnesota)|Central Corridor]], for which a draft [[environmental impact statement]] (DEIS) was drawn up in 1982.<ref name=\"met-council-40\"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://blogs.citypages.com/blotter/2008/05/a_train_between.php|title=A train linking Minneapolis and St. Paul?

Heavy-rail commuter service began on November 14, 2009, with the [[Northstar Line]]. The 2010s decade may finally see several new lines open.\n\n[[Image:Metro Transit-University Avenue-20081002.JPG|thumb|left|upright|Bus and driver on University Avenue in [[Minneapolis, Minnesota]], near Saint Paul]]\nMetro Transit does not cover the whole Twin Cities area. Bus service in the suburbs was being cut back in the early 1980s and suburb-to-suburb service was limited (an issue that remains today). In 1986, cities and counties in the seven-county metropolitan area were given the option to run their own bus services and leave the MTC system. About 17.5% of the area which has regular route transit service is served by these six other \u201copt out\u201d transit systems. About 5% of the system is contracted to private transit providers.\n\nIn the mid-2000s decade, the system claimed to have a safety record five times better than the national average.\n\n==Funding==\nMetro Transit currently receives the majority of its funding from the State Motor Vehicle Sales Tax, the State General Fund, fares and federal revenues. Metro Transit prepares an annual calendar budget, but most of its [[subsidy]] comes from state funds, on a July 1 biennial budget. Between 2001 and 2006, reductions in state general funds and state motor vehicle sales tax collections forced a set of service cuts, fare increases and fuel surcharges, all of which reduced ridership.\n\nLocal policy requires that one third of the system's funding is to come from [[fare]]s and current operations slightly exceed that level. Since 1 October 2008, fares on all buses and trains increased by 25 cents.<ref>http://www.metrotransit.org/news/stories/09_08_fareincrease.asp</ref> Express routes cost more (on limited-stop portions) and certain eligible individuals (such as riders with disabilities) may ride for $1. Many of the fares are more expensive during [[rush hour]] periods. For instance, a rush-hour ride on an express bus costs $3.25, as opposed to $2.50 for non-rush hours. \n<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.metrotransit.org/fares |website=Metro Transit}}</ref>\n\nThe system does not make much use of fare zones aside from downtown zones in Minneapolis and St. Paul, where rides only cost $0.50. [[Transfer (public transit)|Fare transfer]] cards valid for 2.5 hours are available upon payment of fare. Only the Northstar commuter rail line charges fares based on distance. A number of discounted multiple-use transit pass options are available. In early 2007, the system introduced a [[contactless smart card]] (the [[Go-To card]]) for paying fares.\n\nA second fare increase occurred in 2017. \"Under the new system, local fares for off-peak hours will increase from $1.75 to $2; while rides will go from $2.25 to $2.50 for peak hours. Metro Mobility users will pay $3.50 to $4.50 per ride, as well as an additional 75-cent surcharge for trips greater than 15 miles. Transit Link Dial-A-Ride fares will increase, on average, by $1.60, and include a 75-cent distance surcharge.\"<ref name=\"Star Tribune\">{{cite news |last1=Moore |first1=Janet |title=Met Council votes to increase transit fares by 25 cents |url=http://www.startribune.com/it-s-official-transit-fare-increase-of-25-cents/436833953/ |accessdate=July 27, 2017 |publisher=Star Tribune |date=July 27, 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Metro Light Rail and Bus Rapid Transit==\n{{main|Metro (Minnesota)}}\n'''Metro''' is the system of color-coded light rail and bus rapid transit lines owned by the Metropolitan Council that provide service to the Twin Cities region. Metro Transit is the operator of both of the region's light rail lines: the Metro Blue Line and the Metro Green Line. Service on the Metro Red Line bus rapid transit line is operated by [[Minnesota Valley Transit Authority]].\n\n===Metro Blue Line===\n{{main|Blue Line (Minnesota)}}\n[[File:Blue Line Light Rail Train.jpg|thumb|A southbound train from the [[46th Street (Metro Transit station)|46th Street Station]].]]\n[[File:Minneapolis Light Train.jpg|thumb|Light rail in downtown Minneapolis.]]\nThe Metro Blue Line (route 55) opened on June 26, 2004, providing service between [[Hennepin Avenue|Hennepin Ave.]]/[[North Loop, Minneapolis|Warehouse District]] Station and [[Fort Snelling (Metro Transit station)|Fort Snelling]] Station. On December 4, 2004, service was extended to [[Mall of America]] Station via [[Minneapolis\u2013St. Paul International Airport]]. As part of the [[Northstar Commuter Rail]] project, on November 14, 2009, the Blue Line was extended a few blocks north to [[Target Field (Metro Transit Station)]] to provide connections to the new commuter rail line. Current construction plans call for a northern extension of the Metro Blue Line to [[Brooklyn Park, Minnesota|Brooklyn Park]], the current opening date is in the air as BNSF is unwilling to work with Metro Transit on co-locating freight rail and light rail.\n\n===Metro Green Line===\n{{main|Metro Green Line (Minnesota)}}\nThe Metro Green Line opened on June 14, 2014 and connects Downtown Minneapolis, the [[University of Minnesota]], the Midway and Saint Anthony Park neighborhoods of St. Paul, the State Capitol and Downtown St. Paul with light rail service. Future plans call for extending the Green Line to [[Eden Prairie, Minnesota|Eden Prairie]] via the job-rich southwestern suburbs. The Southwest extension isn't expected to be operational until 2023.\n\n===Metro Red Line===\n{{main|Metro Red Line (Minnesota)}}\nThe Metro Red Line is a bus rapid transit line operated by Minnesota Valley Transit Authority on behalf of the Metropolitan Council, providing connections between the Blue Line at Mall of America and the southern suburb of [[Apple Valley, Minnesota|Apple Valley]]. Service began on June 22, 2013.\n\n===Metro Orange Line===\n{{main|Metro Orange Line (Minnesota)}}\nThe Metro Orange Line is a bus rapid transit line that will operate along [[Interstate 35W (Minnesota)|Interstate 35W]] from Downtown Minneapolis to the southern suburbs, terminating in [[Burnsville, Minnesota|Burnsville]]. Recent estimates anticipate opening the Orange Line in 2021.\n\n==Bus routes==\n\n{{main|Metro Transit Routes}}\n\n[[File:SaintPaul 2012 MetroTransit bus-stop.jpg|thumb|An old Metro Transit bus stop sign in downtown Saint Paul, showing all the routes that stop at this location. Newer, more detailed bus stop signs are being gradually introduced.]]\n\nMetro Transit operates 123 bus routes, 66 of which are local routes and 51 are express routes. An additional six bus routes are operated under contract with [[Maple Grove Transit]]. In 2012, Metro Transit buses averaged 230,575 riders per weekday. The system operates almost 900 [[Bus stop|wait shelters]], including 180 reclaimed from CBS Outdoor in March 2014.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.startribune.com/local/minneapolis/245071671.html |title=As big cities privatize bus shelters, Minneapolis moves them to government control |accessdate=2014-05-04 |url-status=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140407194105/http://www.startribune.com/local/minneapolis/245071671.html |archivedate=April 7, 2014 }}</ref>\n\nBus routes are numbered in accordance to portions of the metropolitan area served. Bus routes that primarily serve Minneapolis are numbered 1\u201349, 50\u201359 are inner-city limited-stop routes, 60\u201389 primarily serve St. Paul, and route 94 is an express route that connects the core areas of Minneapolis and St. Paul via [[Interstate 94 in Minnesota|I-94]]. 100 series routes are primarily commuter routes connecting outlying neighborhoods of Minneapolis and St. Paul to the cities' cores, as well as the University of Minnesota. 200 series routes serve the northeast metro, 300 series the southeast, 400 series the southern [[Dakota County, Minnesota|Dakota]] and [[Scott County, Minnesota|Scott County]] suburbs, 500 series the suburbs of [[Richfield, Minnesota|Richfield]], [[Edina, Minnesota|Edina]], and [[Bloomington, Minnesota|Bloomington]], 600 series the west and southwest metro, 700 series the northwest metro and 800 series northern [[Anoka County, Minnesota|Anoka County]] suburbs.\n\nThree-digit route numbers are further subdivided into two groups. Routes ending in x00\u2013x49 are typically local service bus routes connecting METRO stations, shopping areas and other local destinations, whereas those ending in x50\u2013x99 are primarily express service routes which connect outlying suburbs and park and ride facilities to the [[Central business district#United States|central business districts]] of Minneapolis and St. Paul. Additionally, the Northstar Commuter Rail line is publicly given route number 888.\n\n===Hi-Frequency Network===\n\nA subset of the bus network, known as the '''Hi-Frequency Network''' was created on September 9, 2006. This network highlights fourteen bus routes that offer service every 15 minutes or better on weekday periods from 6 am to 7 pm and on Saturdays from 9 am to 6 pm. Segments of routes 2, 5, 6, 10, 11, 18, 21, 64, 54, 515, and all of METRO A Line, [[C Line (Minnesota)|C Line]], Blue Line, and Green Line are currently part of the Hi-Frequency Network.<ref>{{cite web |title=High Frequency network |url=https://www.metrotransit.org/high-frequency-network |website=www.metrotransit.org |accessdate=1 November 2019}}</ref>\n\n=== Arterial Bus Rapid Transit===\n\nMetro Transit has been investing into what it refers to as the [https://www.metrotransit.org/abrt Arterial Bus Rapid Transit] network or \"ABRT\", an enhanced bus service featuring improved station facilities and vehicles, off-board fare payment for reduced dwell-time, higher frequency, and greater spacing between stops for reduced travel time. Currently, planned and existing ABRT lines do not feature exclusive bus lanes. ABRT is also variably referred to as \"Rapid Bus\" or \"Arterial Transit\", among others.\n\nMetro Transit built the [http://www.metrotransit.org/a-line-project A-Line], [[Minneapolis\u2013Saint Paul]]'s first arterial [[bus rapid transit]] line, along [[Snelling Avenue]] and Ford Parkway.

However, Metro Transit is studying the corridor again to determine the need for a longer route.  Following the corridor study, E Line station planning will begin in 2019. Pending full project funding, E Line construction could begin as soon as 2023.\n\n==Northstar Line==\n{{main|Northstar Line}}\nThe Northstar Line is a commuter rail line providing service between Minneapolis and [[Big Lake, Minnesota]], which opened on November 16, 2009. There are additional bus connections to [[Becker, Minnesota|Becker]] and [[St. Cloud, Minnesota|St. Cloud]], with five round-trips in the peak direction, one reverse commute round-trip on weekdays, and three round-trips on Saturdays and Sundays. Additional service is provided on event days, such as during [[Minnesota Twins|Twins]] and [[Minnesota Vikings|Vikings]] games or the [[Super Bowl]].  However, service is not provided on holidays.\n\n==Facilities==\n[[Image:Metro Transit-seat-20081002.JPG|thumb|Metro Transit symbol on a seat on a new bus on [[University Avenue (Minneapolis\u2013Saint Paul)|University Avenue]]]]\n\n===Nicollet Mall===\n\n[[Nicollet Mall]] had been used exclusively for buses and taxis for many years, but the number of buses is being reduced to allow more bicycle use of Nicollet. Beginning in 2005, Metro Transit and the city of Minneapolis experimented with diverting buses from Nicollet to Hennepin Avenue in the evening hours to reduce noise. In December 2009, the \u201cMARQ2\u201d project, partly funded by the federal government under the [[Urban Partnership Agreement]], was completed, in which two-lane busways were built along the parallel roads of Marquette and 2nd Avenue South.<ref name=\"mt-marq2\">{{cite web|url=http://www.metrotransit.org/marq2/|title=Faster express service is coming to downtown Minneapolis|publisher=Metro Transit|accessdate=December 16, 2009}}</ref> A system of lettered gates was established, by which buses would only stop every other block along those two one-mile corridors.  NexTrip digital signs with arrival times were also added, although they weren't functioning at the beginning of the rollout. NexTrip information has also been available through the Metro Transit website since 2008 and can be accessed with [[mobile web browser]]s.<ref name=\"nextrip-may08\">{{cite web|url=http://www.metrocouncil.org/directions/transit/transit2008/NexTripMay08.htm|title=Exactly when is my next bus departing?|date=May 14, 2009|publisher=Metropolitan Council|accessdate=December 17, 2009|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100516055453/http://www.metrocouncil.org/directions/transit/transit2008/NexTripMay08.htm|archivedate=May 16, 2010}}</ref>\n\n===Bus-only shoulders===\n\nSince 1991, Metro Transit buses have been allowed to use \u201c[[Bus bypass shoulder|bus-only shoulders]],\u201d road shoulders to bypass [[traffic jams]]. Currently, buses are allowed to travel no more than {{convert|35|mph|abbr=on}} or {{convert|15|mph|abbr=on}} faster than the congested traffic in the general purpose lanes. Bus drivers must be very attentive when taking the bus onto the shoulder, since that part of the road is only about one foot wider than the buses in many cases. To help with this issue, researchers at the University of Minnesota helped rig up a bus with a [[lane-keep system]], along with a [[heads-up display]] connected to a [[radar]] system to alert the driver of any obstacles. The technology was an adaptation of a system previously tested with drivers of [[snowplow]]s and made some headlines in the early 2000s. This system will be more widely deployed under the Urban Partnership Agreement that assisted in the Marq2 project.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.upa.dot.gov/agreements/minneapolis.htm |title=Minneapolis Urban Partnership Agreement |work=Urban Partnership Agreement and Congestion Reduction Demonstration Programs |publisher=U.S. Department of Transportation |accessdate=2010-02-15 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100827130236/http://www.upa.dot.gov/agreements/minneapolis.htm |archivedate=2010-08-27 }}</ref>\n\n===Transit centers===\n\nMetro Transit operates service to 28 [[transit center]]s, which provide connection points for bus and rail service throughout the metropolitan area.\n\n===Park and rides===\n\nMetro Transit operates service to 79 [[park and ride]] lots and ramps, with a total of 13,829 parking spaces. These lots allow commuters to park their cars for free and take buses and trains to the downtown areas to avoid traffic congestion and parking fees.\n\n== Fleet ==\n=== Buses ===\n[[File:Metro Transit bus stop at Coffman Memorial Union.jpg|thumb|Metro Transit buses at Washington Avenue bus stop on north side of [[Coffman Memorial Union]] on the [[University of Minnesota]] East Bank campus.]]\nMetro Transit operates the [[Gillig Phantom]], [[Gillig Low Floor|Gillig Advantage]] (which comprises the majority of the fleet), [[New Flyer]] D60HF, D60LFR, Xcelsior XD60, and [[Motor Coach Industries|MCI]] D4500.\n\nIn the 2000s, most buses had a mostly white [[livery]] with a predominantly blue strip running horizontally along the side and a large white \u201cT\u201d inside a red circle on the roof. Diesel\u2013electric hybrid buses introduced toward the end of the decade spurred new color schemes, with yellow at the front and the blue line moved above the side windows. The METRO light-rail vehicles have a different color scheme: predominantly blue and white, with yellow on each end. Metro Transit also uses [[vehicle wrap]] advertising on some buses and light rail cars, creating a different appearance.\n\nAll of the buses are [[handicapped-accessible]], either using [[hydraulic]] lifts or a [[low-floor]] design. The Metropolitan Council also operates the Metro Mobility [[paratransit]] system for door-to-door transportation.\n\nAll Metro Transit buses and light- and heavy-rail trains have bike racks installed.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.metrotransit.org/bike-options.aspx |title=Metro Transit - Bike Options}}</ref>\n\n=== Rail ===\n{{main|Metro Transit rolling stock}}\n\n[[Bombardier Transportation|Bombardier]] [[Flexity Swift]] 27 vehicles are operated on the [[Blue Line (Minnesota)|Blue Line]] light rail line.

The organization traces its history back to the 19th-century [[streetcar]] systems of the region through the acquisition in 1970 of the [[Twin City Rapid Transit|Twin City Lines]] bus system from businessman [[Carl Pohlad]]. At the time of the acquisition, Twin City Lines had 635 buses: 75% of those were over 15 years old and 86 buses were so old that they were banned from operating in Minneapolis. MTC acquired 465 new buses over the next five years and built many new bus shelters.<ref name=\"met-council-40\">{{cite web|url=http://www.metrocouncil.org/about/metcouncilhistory.pdf|title=A bold experiment: the Metropolitan Council at 40|publisher=Metropolitan Council|accessdate=December 16, 2009|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100613070633/http://metrocouncil.org/about/MetCouncilHistory.pdf|archivedate=June 13, 2010}}</ref>\n\nShortly thereafter, a long battle began to return rail transit to the region and efforts for additional lines continue at a snail's pace. It took 32 years to see the first line implemented. In 1972, the Regional Fixed Guideway Study for MTC proposed a $1.3 billion 37- or 57-mile (sources differ) [[Heavy rail#Heavy rail|heavy-rail]] [[rapid transit]] system, but the then-separate Metropolitan Council disagreed with that idea\u2014refusing to even look at the plan\u2014and continuing political battles prevented its implementation. The Met Council had its own plans for [[bus rapid transit]] in the Cities. Another system using smaller [[people mover]]s was proposed in the 1975 Small Vehicle Fixed Guideway Study and gained the most traction with the [[Saint Paul, Minnesota|Saint Paul]] city council, but was eventually dropped in 1980. In the 1980s, [[light rail]] was proposed as an alternative and several possible corridors were identified, including the [[Green Line (Minnesota)|Central Corridor]], for which a draft [[environmental impact statement]] (DEIS) was drawn up in 1982.<ref name=\"met-council-40\"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://blogs.citypages.com/blotter/2008/05/a_train_between.php|title=A train linking Minneapolis and St. Paul?

Heavy-rail commuter service began on November 14, 2009, with the [[Northstar Line]]. The 2010s decade may finally see several new lines open.\n\n[[Image:Metro Transit-University Avenue-20081002.JPG|thumb|left|upright|Bus and driver on University Avenue in [[Minneapolis, Minnesota]], near Saint Paul]]\nMetro Transit does not cover the whole Twin Cities area. Bus service in the suburbs was being cut back in the early 1980s and suburb-to-suburb service was limited (an issue that remains today). In 1986, cities and counties in the seven-county metropolitan area were given the option to run their own bus services and leave the MTC system. About 17.5% of the area which has regular route transit service is served by these six other \u201copt out\u201d transit systems. About 5% of the system is contracted to private transit providers.\n\nIn the mid-2000s decade, the system claimed to have a safety record five times better than the national average.\n\n==Funding==\nMetro Transit currently receives the majority of its funding from the State Motor Vehicle Sales Tax, the State General Fund, fares and federal revenues. Metro Transit prepares an annual calendar budget, but most of its [[subsidy]] comes from state funds, on a July 1 biennial budget. Between 2001 and 2006, reductions in state general funds and state motor vehicle sales tax collections forced a set of service cuts, fare increases and fuel surcharges, all of which reduced ridership.\n\nLocal policy requires that one third of the system's funding is to come from [[fare]]s and current operations slightly exceed that level. Since 1 October 2008, fares on all buses and trains increased by 25 cents.<ref>http://www.metrotransit.org/news/stories/09_08_fareincrease.asp</ref> Express routes cost more (on limited-stop portions) and certain eligible individuals (such as riders with disabilities) may ride for $1. Many of the fares are more expensive during [[rush hour]] periods. For instance, a rush-hour ride on an express bus costs $3.25, as opposed to $2.50 for non-rush hours. \n<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.metrotransit.org/fares |website=Metro Transit}}</ref>\n\nThe system does not make much use of fare zones aside from downtown zones in Minneapolis and St. Paul, where rides only cost $0.50. [[Transfer (public transit)|Fare transfer]] cards valid for 2.5 hours are available upon payment of fare. Only the Northstar commuter rail line charges fares based on distance. A number of discounted multiple-use transit pass options are available. In early 2007, the system introduced a [[contactless smart card]] (the [[Go-To card]]) for paying fares.\n\nA second fare increase occurred in 2017. \"Under the new system, local fares for off-peak hours will increase from $1.75 to $2; while rides will go from $2.25 to $2.50 for peak hours. Metro Mobility users will pay $3.50 to $4.50 per ride, as well as an additional 75-cent surcharge for trips greater than 15 miles. Transit Link Dial-A-Ride fares will increase, on average, by $1.60, and include a 75-cent distance surcharge.\"<ref name=\"Star Tribune\">{{cite news |last1=Moore |first1=Janet |title=Met Council votes to increase transit fares by 25 cents |url=http://www.startribune.com/it-s-official-transit-fare-increase-of-25-cents/436833953/ |accessdate=July 27, 2017 |publisher=Star Tribune |date=July 27, 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Metro Light Rail and Bus Rapid Transit==\n{{main|Metro (Minnesota)}}\n'''Metro''' is the system of color-coded light rail and bus rapid transit lines owned by the Metropolitan Council that provide service to the Twin Cities region. Metro Transit is the operator of both of the region's light rail lines: the Metro Blue Line and the Metro Green Line. Service on the Metro Red Line bus rapid transit line is operated by [[Minnesota Valley Transit Authority]].\n\n===Metro Blue Line===\n{{main|Blue Line (Minnesota)}}\n[[File:Blue Line Light Rail Train.jpg|thumb|A southbound train from the [[46th Street (Metro Transit station)|46th Street Station]].]]\n[[File:Minneapolis Light Train.jpg|thumb|Light rail in downtown Minneapolis.]]\nThe Metro Blue Line (route 55) opened on June 26, 2004, providing service between [[Hennepin Avenue|Hennepin Ave.]]/[[North Loop, Minneapolis|Warehouse District]] Station and [[Fort Snelling (Metro Transit station)|Fort Snelling]] Station. On December 4, 2004, service was extended to [[Mall of America]] Station via [[Minneapolis\u2013St. Paul International Airport]]. As part of the [[Northstar Commuter Rail]] project, on November 14, 2009, the Blue Line was extended a few blocks north to [[Target Field (Metro Transit Station)]] to provide connections to the new commuter rail line. Current construction plans call for a northern extension of the Metro Blue Line to [[Brooklyn Park, Minnesota|Brooklyn Park]], the current opening date is in the air as BNSF is unwilling to work with Metro Transit on co-locating freight rail and light rail.\n\n===Metro Green Line===\n{{main|Metro Green Line (Minnesota)}}\nThe Metro Green Line opened on June 14, 2014 and connects Downtown Minneapolis, the [[University of Minnesota]], the Midway and Saint Anthony Park neighborhoods of St. Paul, the State Capitol and Downtown St. Paul with light rail service. Future plans call for extending the Green Line to [[Eden Prairie, Minnesota|Eden Prairie]] via the job-rich southwestern suburbs. The Southwest extension isn't expected to be operational until 2023.\n\n===Metro Red Line===\n{{main|Metro Red Line (Minnesota)}}\nThe Metro Red Line is a bus rapid transit line operated by Minnesota Valley Transit Authority on behalf of the Metropolitan Council, providing connections between the Blue Line at Mall of America and the southern suburb of [[Apple Valley, Minnesota|Apple Valley]]. Service began on June 22, 2013.\n\n===Metro Orange Line===\n{{main|Metro Orange Line (Minnesota)}}\nThe Metro Orange Line is a bus rapid transit line that will operate along [[Interstate 35W (Minnesota)|Interstate 35W]] from Downtown Minneapolis to the southern suburbs, terminating in [[Burnsville, Minnesota|Burnsville]].

An additional six bus routes are operated under contract with [[Maple Grove Transit]]. In 2012, Metro Transit buses averaged 230,575 riders per weekday. The system operates almost 900 [[Bus stop|wait shelters]], including 180 reclaimed from CBS Outdoor in March 2014.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.startribune.com/local/minneapolis/245071671.html |title=As big cities privatize bus shelters, Minneapolis moves them to government control |accessdate=2014-05-04 |url-status=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140407194105/http://www.startribune.com/local/minneapolis/245071671.html |archivedate=April 7, 2014 }}</ref>\n\nBus routes are numbered in accordance to portions of the metropolitan area served. Bus routes that primarily serve Minneapolis are numbered 1\u201349, 50\u201359 are inner-city limited-stop routes, 60\u201389 primarily serve St. Paul, and route 94 is an express route that connects the core areas of Minneapolis and St. Paul via [[Interstate 94 in Minnesota|I-94]]. 100 series routes are primarily commuter routes connecting outlying neighborhoods of Minneapolis and St. Paul to the cities' cores, as well as the University of Minnesota. 200 series routes serve the northeast metro, 300 series the southeast, 400 series the southern [[Dakota County, Minnesota|Dakota]] and [[Scott County, Minnesota|Scott County]] suburbs, 500 series the suburbs of [[Richfield, Minnesota|Richfield]], [[Edina, Minnesota|Edina]], and [[Bloomington, Minnesota|Bloomington]], 600 series the west and southwest metro, 700 series the northwest metro and 800 series northern [[Anoka County, Minnesota|Anoka County]] suburbs.\n\nThree-digit route numbers are further subdivided into two groups. Routes ending in x00\u2013x49 are typically local service bus routes connecting METRO stations, shopping areas and other local destinations, whereas those ending in x50\u2013x99 are primarily express service routes which connect outlying suburbs and park and ride facilities to the [[Central business district#United States|central business districts]] of Minneapolis and St. Paul. Additionally, the Northstar Commuter Rail line is publicly given route number 888.\n\n===Hi-Frequency Network===\n\nA subset of the bus network, known as the '''Hi-Frequency Network''' was created on September 9, 2006. This network highlights fourteen bus routes that offer service every 15 minutes or better on weekday periods from 6 am to 7 pm and on Saturdays from 9 am to 6 pm. Segments of routes 2, 5, 6, 10, 11, 18, 21, 64, 54, 515, and all of METRO A Line, [[C Line (Minnesota)|C Line]], Blue Line, and Green Line are currently part of the Hi-Frequency Network.<ref>{{cite web |title=High Frequency network |url=https://www.metrotransit.org/high-frequency-network |website=www.metrotransit.org |accessdate=1 November 2019}}</ref>\n\n=== Arterial Bus Rapid Transit===\n\nMetro Transit has been investing into what it refers to as the [https://www.metrotransit.org/abrt Arterial Bus Rapid Transit] network or \"ABRT\", an enhanced bus service featuring improved station facilities and vehicles, off-board fare payment for reduced dwell-time, higher frequency, and greater spacing between stops for reduced travel time. Currently, planned and existing ABRT lines do not feature exclusive bus lanes. ABRT is also variably referred to as \"Rapid Bus\" or \"Arterial Transit\", among others.\n\nMetro Transit built the [http://www.metrotransit.org/a-line-project A-Line], [[Minneapolis\u2013Saint Paul]]'s first arterial [[bus rapid transit]] line, along [[Snelling Avenue]] and Ford Parkway.

Pending full project funding, E Line construction could begin as soon as 2023.\n\n==Northstar Line==\n{{main|Northstar Line}}\nThe Northstar Line is a commuter rail line providing service between Minneapolis and [[Big Lake, Minnesota]], which opened on November 16, 2009. There are additional bus connections to [[Becker, Minnesota|Becker]] and [[St. Cloud, Minnesota|St. Cloud]], with five round-trips in the peak direction, one reverse commute round-trip on weekdays, and three round-trips on Saturdays and Sundays.

Beginning in 2005, Metro Transit and the city of Minneapolis experimented with diverting buses from Nicollet to Hennepin Avenue in the evening hours to reduce noise. In December 2009, the \u201cMARQ2\u201d project, partly funded by the federal government under the [[Urban Partnership Agreement]], was completed, in which two-lane busways were built along the parallel roads of Marquette and 2nd Avenue South.<ref name=\"mt-marq2\">{{cite web|url=http://www.metrotransit.org/marq2/|title=Faster express service is coming to downtown Minneapolis|publisher=Metro Transit|accessdate=December 16, 2009}}</ref> A system of lettered gates was established, by which buses would only stop every other block along those two one-mile corridors.  NexTrip digital signs with arrival times were also added, although they weren't functioning at the beginning of the rollout.

Currently, buses are allowed to travel no more than {{convert|35|mph|abbr=on}} or {{convert|15|mph|abbr=on}} faster than the congested traffic in the general purpose lanes. Bus drivers must be very attentive when taking the bus onto the shoulder, since that part of the road is only about one foot wider than the buses in many cases. To help with this issue, researchers at the University of Minnesota helped rig up a bus with a [[lane-keep system]], along with a [[heads-up display]] connected to a [[radar]] system to alert the driver of any obstacles. The technology was an adaptation of a system previously tested with drivers of [[snowplow]]s and made some headlines in the early 2000s. This system will be more widely deployed under the Urban Partnership Agreement that assisted in the Marq2 project.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.upa.dot.gov/agreements/minneapolis.htm |title=Minneapolis Urban Partnership Agreement |work=Urban Partnership Agreement and Congestion Reduction Demonstration Programs |publisher=U.S. Department of Transportation |accessdate=2010-02-15 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100827130236/http://www.upa.dot.gov/agreements/minneapolis.htm |archivedate=2010-08-27 }}</ref>\n\n===Transit centers===\n\nMetro Transit operates service to 28 [[transit center]]s, which provide connection points for bus and rail service throughout the metropolitan area.\n\n===Park and rides===\n\nMetro Transit operates service to 79 [[park and ride]] lots and ramps, with a total of 13,829 parking spaces.

Diesel\u2013electric hybrid buses introduced toward the end of the decade spurred new color schemes, with yellow at the front and the blue line moved above the side windows. The METRO light-rail vehicles have a different color scheme: predominantly blue and white, with yellow on each end. Metro Transit also uses [[vehicle wrap]] advertising on some buses and light rail cars, creating a different appearance.\n\nAll of the buses are [[handicapped-accessible]], either using [[hydraulic]] lifts or a [[low-floor]] design. The Metropolitan Council also operates the Metro Mobility [[paratransit]] system for door-to-door transportation.\n\nAll Metro Transit buses and light- and heavy-rail trains have bike racks installed.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.metrotransit.org/bike-options.aspx |title=Metro Transit - Bike Options}}</ref>\n\n=== Rail ===\n{{main|Metro Transit rolling stock}}\n\n[[Bombardier Transportation|Bombardier]] [[Flexity Swift]] 27 vehicles are operated on the [[Blue Line (Minnesota)|Blue Line]] light rail line.

It was established in 1882 through a joint partnership between the [[Churches of God General Conference (Winebrenner)|Churches of God General Conference]] and the city of Findlay. UF has nearly 60 undergraduate programs of study leading to baccalaureate degrees and offers 10 master's degrees and four doctorate-level degree programs. Nearly 4,200 students from approximately 35 countries are enrolled at Findlay with an international student population of approximately 500. Approximately 1,250 students live on campus in [[Dormitory|university housing]]. The University of Findlay has a {{convert|73|acre|adj=on}} main campus and six off-campus facilities.\n\n==History ==\nThe predecessor of the University of Findlay, Findlay College, was founded on January 28, 1882, by the city of [[Findlay, Ohio|Findlay]] and the [[Churches of God General Conference (Winebrenner)|Churches of God General Conference]]. By 1897, the college had established an [[Financial endowment|endowment]] of more than $100,000 and boasted sixteen faculty members. In 1989, Findlay College became known as the University of Findlay. The campus, still affiliated with the Church of God, embarked on a building campaign, adding five new buildings over the next several years. By the start of the twenty-first century, the institution boasted sixty-five different areas of undergraduate study and eight graduate programs. The university is especially well known for its equestrian studies program and offers equestrian riding as a varsity sport. In 2012, the university added structures to Davis Street to host its newly created pharmacy program.\n\n==Academics==\n[[File:University of Findlay Science and Bell.jpg|thumb|Science center with the bell from Old Main]]\nThe University of Findlay established the nation's first bachelor's degree in [[hazardous waste]] studies, now known as environmental, safety and occupational health management.

It was established in 1882 through a joint partnership between the [[Churches of God General Conference (Winebrenner)|Churches of God General Conference]] and the city of Findlay. UF has nearly 60 undergraduate programs of study leading to baccalaureate degrees and offers 10 master's degrees and four doctorate-level degree programs.

By 1897, the college had established an [[Financial endowment|endowment]] of more than $100,000 and boasted sixteen faculty members. In 1989, Findlay College became known as the University of Findlay. The campus, still affiliated with the Church of God, embarked on a building campaign, adding five new buildings over the next several years. By the start of the twenty-first century, the institution boasted sixty-five different areas of undergraduate study and eight graduate programs. The university is especially well known for its equestrian studies program and offers equestrian riding as a varsity sport. In 2012, the university added structures to Davis Street to host its newly created pharmacy program.\n\n==Academics==\n[[File:University of Findlay Science and Bell.jpg|thumb|Science center with the bell from Old Main]]\nThe University of Findlay established the nation's first bachelor's degree in [[hazardous waste]] studies, now known as environmental, safety and occupational health management.

''The BL'' has spent at least $510,698 on Facebook advertising. Hundreds of the ads were removed for violations of Facebook's advertising rules. The ''BL'' network of pages has 28 million followers on Facebook in total, according to ''Snopes''.

Meanwhile, the opposition parties in the constituency were shifting, and the [[New Democratic Party (Canada)|New Democratic Party]] candidate beat the [[Progressive Conservative Party of Canada|Progressive Conservative]] or [[Conservative Party of Canada|Conservative]] candidate in every election since 1979.\n\nAfter the election of Paul Martin to the Liberal leadership in late 2003, Charles Caccia lost the nomination for the seat to local city councillor [[Mario Silva (politician)|Mario Silva]], who had signed up sufficient new members to oust the incumbent; this was an unpopular situation and was deeply resented by many in the local Liberal party, which, combined with redistricting, led to an overnight tripling of the NDP vote in the 2004 federal election.\n\nIn 2011, [[Andrew Cash]] of the New Democratic Party won the seat by a significant margin, becoming the first non-Liberal in over 50 years to represent the riding.\n\nThis riding lost a fraction of territory to [[Toronto\u2014St. Paul's]] during the [[Canadian federal electoral redistribution, 2012|2012 electoral redistribution]].\n\n==Members of Parliament==\n\nThis riding has elected the following [[Members of Parliament]]:\n\n{{CanMP}}\n{{CanMP nodata|Davenport<br />''Riding created from'' [[Parkdale (electoral district)|Parkdale]] ''and'' [[Toronto Northwest]]}}\n{{CanMP row\n| FromYr = 1935\n| ToYr = 1940\n| Assembly# = 18\n| CanParty = Conservative (historical)\n| RepName = John Ritchie MacNicol\n| RepTerms# = 3\n| PartyTerms# = 1\n}}\n{{CanMP row\n| FromYr = 1940\n| ToYr = 1945\n| Assembly# = 19\n| CanParty = National Government\n| PartyTerms# = 1\n}}\n{{CanMP row\n| FromYr = 1945\n| ToYr = 1949\n| Assembly# = 20\n| CanParty = PC\n| PartyTerms# = 1\n}}\n{{CanMP row\n| FromYr = 1949\n| ToYr = 1953\n| Assembly# = 21\n| CanParty = Liberal\n| RepName = Paul Hellyer\n| RepTerms# = 2\n| PartyTerms# = 2\n}}\n{{CanMP row\n| FromYr = 1953\n| ToYr = 1957\n| Assembly# = 22\n}}\n{{CanMP row\n| FromYr = 1957\n| ToYr = 1958\n| Assembly# = 23\n| CanParty = PC\n| RepName = Douglas Morton\n| RepTerms# = 2\n| PartyTerms# = 2\n}}\n{{CanMP row\n| FromYr = 1958\n| ToYr = 1962\n| Assembly# = 24\n}}\n{{CanMP row\n| FromYr = 1962\n| ToYr = 1963\n| Assembly# = 25\n| CanParty = Liberal\n| RepName = Walter L.

Until 2011 the last non-Liberal to be elected for the constituency was [[Progressive Conservative Party of Canada|Progressive Conservative]] [[Member of Parliament]] [[Douglas Morton]] in 1958. Since then, Liberals [[Walter L. Gordon|Walter Gordon]] and [[Charles Caccia]] (who himself held the seat for nearly 40 years) won the seat by increasing margins, finally culminating in a 17,500-vote majority in 1993. Meanwhile, the opposition parties in the constituency were shifting, and the [[New Democratic Party (Canada)|New Democratic Party]] candidate beat the [[Progressive Conservative Party of Canada|Progressive Conservative]] or [[Conservative Party of Canada|Conservative]] candidate in every election since 1979.\n\nAfter the election of Paul Martin to the Liberal leadership in late 2003, Charles Caccia lost the nomination for the seat to local city councillor [[Mario Silva (politician)|Mario Silva]], who had signed up sufficient new members to oust the incumbent; this was an unpopular situation and was deeply resented by many in the local Liberal party, which, combined with redistricting, led to an overnight tripling of the NDP vote in the 2004 federal election.\n\nIn 2011 [[Andrew Cash]] of the New Democratic Party won the seat by a significant margin, becoming the first non-Liberal in over 50 years to represent the riding.\n\nThis riding lost a fraction of territory to [[Toronto\u2014St. Paul's]] during the [[Canadian federal electoral redistribution, 2012|2012 electoral redistribution]].\n\n==Members of Parliament==\n\nThis riding has elected the following [[Members of Parliament]]:\n\n{{CanMP}}\n{{CanMP nodata|Davenport<br />''Riding created from'' [[Parkdale (electoral district)|Parkdale]] ''and'' [[Toronto Northwest]]}}\n{{CanMP row\n| FromYr = 1935\n| ToYr = 1940\n| Assembly# = 18\n| CanParty = Conservative (historical)\n| RepName = John Ritchie MacNicol\n| RepTerms# = 3\n| PartyTerms# = 1\n}}\n{{CanMP row\n| FromYr = 1940\n| ToYr = 1945\n| Assembly# = 19\n| CanParty = National Government\n| PartyTerms# = 1\n}}\n{{CanMP row\n| FromYr = 1945\n| ToYr = 1949\n| Assembly# = 20\n| CanParty = PC\n| PartyTerms# = 1\n}}\n{{CanMP row\n| FromYr = 1949\n| ToYr = 1953\n| Assembly# = 21\n| CanParty = Liberal\n| RepName = Paul Hellyer\n| RepTerms# = 2\n| PartyTerms# = 2\n}}\n{{CanMP row\n| FromYr = 1953\n| ToYr = 1957\n| Assembly# = 22\n}}\n{{CanMP row\n| FromYr = 1957\n| ToYr = 1958\n| Assembly# = 23\n| CanParty = PC\n| RepName = Douglas Morton\n| RepTerms# = 2\n| PartyTerms# = 2\n}}\n{{CanMP row\n| FromYr = 1958\n| ToYr = 1962\n| Assembly# = 24\n}}\n{{CanMP row\n| FromYr = 1962\n| ToYr = 1963\n| Assembly# = 25\n| CanParty = Liberal\n| RepName = Walter L.

Davis was the fifth and longest-serving president of [[West Virginia State University|West Virginia State College]] in [[Institute, West Virginia]], from 1919 to 1953. Born in [[Milledgeville, Georgia]], Davis relocated to [[Atlanta]] in 1903 to attend high school at Atlanta Baptist College (later known as [[Morehouse College]]). He worked his way through high school and college at Morehouse, and graduated with a [[Bachelor of Arts]] in 1911. At Morehouse, Davis formed associations with [[John Hope (educator)|John Hope]], [[Booker T. Washington]], and [[W. E. B. Du Bois]]. He completed [[Graduate school|graduate studies]] in physics and chemistry at the [[University of Chicago]] from 1911 to 1913, and served on the faculty of Morehouse as the [[Registrar (education)|registrar]] and as a professor in physics and chemistry. While in Atlanta, Davis helped to found one of the city's first chapters of the [[NAACP|National Association for the Advancement of Colored People]] (NAACP).\n\nDavis served as the executive secretary of the [[Twelfth Street YMCA Building|Twelfth Street YMCA]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] from 1917 to 1919, when he was elected as the president of West Virginia Collegiate Institute. Under Davis' leadership, West Virginia Collegiate Institute (later renamed West Virginia State College) became one of the leading [[historically black colleges and universities]] and [[Land-grant university|land-grant universities]] in the United States, in both academics and athletics. Through Davis' efforts, West Virginia Collegiate Institute became the first African American college to be [[Educational accreditation|accredited]] by the [[North Central Association of Colleges and Schools]] (NCA) in 1927. Under Davis' leadership, the college became home to the West Virginia Schools for the Colored Deaf and Blind and to West Virginia's [[Cooperative State Research, Education, and Extension Service|Extension Service]] for African Americans. Davis also secured a [[Civilian Pilot Training Program]] (CPTP) and [[Army Specialized Training Program]] (ASTP) unit for the college during [[World War II]]. Through his efforts and educational statesmanship, Davis laid the groundwork for West Virginia State's transition into an integrated institution, and white students began enrolling in large numbers toward the end of his presidency.\n\nDavis was appointed by U.S. President [[Harry S. Truman]] as a charter member to the first [[National Science Board]] for the [[National Science Foundation]], on which he served from 1950 to 1956. In addition, President Truman appointed Davis as the director of the [[Point Four Program|Technical Cooperation Administration]] program in [[Liberia]] from 1952 to 1954. Davis helped to establish the [[NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund]] (NAACP LDF), and he served as special director of the NAACP LDF Teacher Information and Security Program from 1955 to 1972. In this role, Davis administered the NAACP LDF's scholarship programs for African American undergraduate, graduate, and professional students. In his later life, Davis was appointed to the U.S. National Commission for the [[UNESCO|United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization]] (UNESCO) and served as a member of the [[Bergen Community College|Bergen County College]] board of trustees. Davis continued to work as an active consultant for the NAACP LDF and serve as the head of its Herbert Lehmann Fund until his death in 1980. Davis was a recipient of 14 [[honorary degrees]] throughout his lifetime, and he was awarded [[Haiti]]'s [[National Order of Honour and Merit]] (1948) and [[Liberia]]'s [[Order of the Star of Africa]] for his service to those countries.\n\n== Early life and education ==\nJohn Warren Davis was born on 11 February 1888 in [[Milledgeville, Georgia]].<ref name=\"WVAH 1\">{{cite web |url= http://www.wvculture.org/history/archives/blacks/jwdavis.html |title= John Warren Davis  |author= West Virginia Archives and History |year= 2019 |publisher= West Virginia Department of Arts, Culture and History |access-date= 29 February 2020 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20200229171815/http://www.wvculture.org/history/archives/blacks/jwdavis.html |archive-date= 29 February 2020}}</ref><ref name=\"The Record 1\">{{cite newspaper | last = Anderson | first = Gene | title = Dr. John Warren Davis, adviser to five presidents | newspaper = [[The Record (North Jersey)|The Record]] | location = [[Hackensack, New Jersey]] | date = 13 July 1980 | page = 22 | url = https://www.newspapers.com/clip/46009114/dr-john-warren-davis-adviser-to-five/ | accessdate = 2 March 2020 | via = [[Newspapers.com]] | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20200302233738/https://www.newspapers.com/clip/46009114/dr-john-warren-davis-adviser-to-five/ | archive-date = 2 March 2020}}</ref> He was the son of Robert Marion Davis, a merchant, and his wife, Katie Mann Davis.<ref name=\"WVAH 1\"/><ref name=\"MSRC 2015 4\">{{Harvnb|Moorland\u2013Spingarn Research Center Staff|2015|p=4.}}</ref> Davis' mother, Katie Mann Davis, was the biracial daughter of a white pastor.<ref name=\"Bardolph 123\">{{Harvnb|Bardolph|1959|p=123.}}</ref> Davis was raised at his maternal grandfather's home from the age of five, after his parents relocated to [[Savannah, Georgia|Savannah]] with their other children.<ref name=\"Bardolph 123\"/>\n\nDavis attended elementary school in Milledgeville; however, since there were no public high schools for African Americans in the U.S. state of [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], Davis relocated to [[Atlanta]] in 1903 to attend [[Morehouse College|Atlanta Baptist College]] (later known as Morehouse College).<ref name=\"MSRC 2015 4\"/><ref name=\"Garibaldi x\">{{Harvnb|Garibaldi|1984|p=x.}}</ref> He worked his way through high school and college at Morehouse,<ref name=\"Garibaldi x\"/> and gained the attention of the college's first African American president, [[John Hope (educator)|John Hope]], while polishing the floor of the president's house.<ref name=\"Bardolph 130\">{{Harvnb|Bardolph|1959|p=130.}}</ref> Hope, known as \"the maker of college presidents,\" elevated Davis to a position in the college's business office.<ref name=\"Bardolph 130\"/> Davis completed the school's academic course in 1907<ref name=\"Morehouse College 1921 99\">{{Harvnb|Morehouse College|1921|p=99.}}</ref> and graduated with a [[Bachelor of Arts]] (with honors) in 1911.<ref name=\"The Record 1\"/><ref name=\"Garibaldi x\"/><ref name=\"Morehouse College 1921 89\">{{Harvnb|Morehouse College|1921|p=89.}}</ref>\n\nWhile attending Morehouse, Davis was a roommate of [[Mordecai Wyatt Johnson]], who later served as president of [[Howard University]].<ref name=\"Garibaldi x\"/> Through his associations with [[Booker T.

Davis was the fifth and longest-serving president of [[West Virginia State University|West Virginia State College]] in [[Institute, West Virginia]], from 1919 to 1953. Born in [[Milledgeville, Georgia]], Davis relocated to [[Atlanta]] in 1903 to attend high school at Atlanta Baptist College (later known as [[Morehouse College]]). He worked his way through high school and college at Morehouse, and graduated with a [[Bachelor of Arts]] in 1911. At Morehouse, Davis formed associations with [[John Hope (educator)|John Hope]], [[Booker T. Washington]], and [[W. E. B. Du Bois]]. He completed [[Graduate school|graduate studies]] in physics and chemistry at the [[University of Chicago]] from 1911 to 1913, and served on the faculty of Morehouse as the [[Registrar (education)|registrar]] and as a professor in physics and chemistry. While in Atlanta, Davis helped to found one of the city's first chapters of the [[NAACP|National Association for the Advancement of Colored People]] (NAACP).\n\nDavis served as the executive secretary of the [[Twelfth Street YMCA Building|Twelfth Street YMCA]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] from 1917 to 1919, when he was elected as the president of West Virginia Collegiate Institute. Under Davis' leadership, West Virginia Collegiate Institute (later renamed West Virginia State College) became one of the leading [[historically black colleges and universities]] and [[Land-grant university|land-grant universities]] in the United States, in both academics and athletics. Through Davis' efforts, West Virginia Collegiate Institute became the first African American college to be [[Educational accreditation|accredited]] by the [[North Central Association of Colleges and Schools]] (NCA) in 1927. Under Davis' leadership, the college became home to the West Virginia Schools for the Colored Deaf and Blind and to West Virginia's [[Cooperative State Research, Education, and Extension Service|Extension Service]] for African Americans. Davis also secured a [[Civilian Pilot Training Program]] (CPTP) and [[Army Specialized Training Program]] (ASTP) unit for the college during [[World War II]]. Through his efforts and educational statesmanship, Davis laid the groundwork for West Virginia State's transition into an integrated institution, and white students began enrolling in large numbers toward the end of his presidency.\n\nDavis was appointed by U.S. President [[Harry S. Truman]] as a charter member to the first [[National Science Board]] for the [[National Science Foundation]], on which he served from 1950 to 1956. In addition, President Truman appointed Davis as the director of the [[Point Four Program|Technical Cooperation Administration]] program in [[Liberia]] from 1952 to 1954. Davis helped to establish the [[NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund]] (NAACP LDF), and he served as special director of the NAACP LDF Teacher Information and Security Program from 1955 to 1972. In this role, Davis administered the NAACP LDF's scholarship programs for African American undergraduate, graduate, and professional students.

West Virginia Civil Air Patrol, becoming the first African Americans in the state's air patrol.<ref name=\"WVAH 7\"/> In the summer of 1940, West Virginia State became the first African American

read about the ASTP in newspapers and in ''School and Safety'', the [[American Council on Education]]'s weekly newsletter, and he sent a letter on 16 June 1943 to the ASTP Director, [[United States Army]] Colonel [[Herman Beukema]].<ref name=\"Keefer 1994 119\u2013132\"/> Beukema responded by stating that the ASTP was, \"utilizing the facilities of Howard University, [[Prairie View A&M University|Prairie View State College]], and [[North Carolina A&T State University|Agricultural and Technical College of North Carolina]]. Inasmuch as the above institutions meet the present demand, based upon the number of Negro trainees available, we have no immediate need of any other institutions. It is planned that West Virginia State College will be given an Army Specialized Training Unit at the earliest possible date.\"<ref name=\"Keefer 1994 119\u2013132\"/>\n\nDavis was only made aware that West Virginia State was receiving an ASTP unit two weeks before ASTP personnel arrived on its campus.<ref name=\"Keefer 1994 119\u2013132\"/> On 16 July 1943, Colonel W. G. Johnston of the [[Army Service Forces]]' Fifth Service Command called Davis to inform him, and two days later, Johnston confirmed the tentative number of ASTP trainees, arrival date, and basic engineering courses to be offered, and that a contract \"negotiating party\" would soon visit the campus.<ref name=\"Keefer 1994 119\u2013132\"/> Within a week's time, West Virginia State reached agreements with the Fifth Service Command, and Davis commenced modifications to the college's Gore Hall, where most of the ASTP personnel were housed.<ref name=\"Keefer 1994 119\u2013132\"/> On 22 July 1943, Davis wrote to Johnston, asking for him to increase the number of ASTP trainees from the expected 150 to 300, a figure which included 17-year-old ASTP reservists from West Virginia that were to be sent to other colleges for ASTP training.<ref name=\"Keefer 1994 119\u2013132\"/> In this letter, Davis assured Johnston, \"the entire force of this college... is now busy preparing for the arrival of AST trainees.\"<ref name=\"Keefer 1994 119\u2013132\"/>\n\n=== Nonpartisan leadership style ===\nThroughout his tenure as president of West Virginia State, Davis was able to govern the college with a surprising degree of independence and political nonpartisanship, despite the college's proximity to the [[West Virginia State Capitol|state capitol]] in nearby [[Charleston, West Virginia|Charleston]].<ref name=\"Bardolph 227\u20138\">{{Harvnb|Bardolph|1959|pp=227\u20138.}}</ref><ref name=\"Smith 1994 62\">{{Harvnb|Smith|1994|p=62.}}</ref> In a 1944 meeting of the West Virginia State faculty, Davis explained his disinterest in partisan politics: \"I have never felt it my duty to go and dabble in partisan politics. I hold the position that I have a unique place in the life of the state. You and I are to cooperate in guiding this school, that whatever party is in power, the success of the institution can be a credit to that party.\"<ref name=\"Smith 1994 62\"/> However, Davis advocated the college's advancement in all matters in his correspondences with West Virginia state legislators and officials.<ref name=\"Smith 1994 62\"/> He also leveraged his faculty as a resource for providing expertise and assistance to state politicians, regardless of their party.<ref name=\"Smith 1994 62\"/> When a [[West Virginia Senate|West Virginia state senator]] expressed an interest in having German papers translated, Davis recommended a West Virginia State faculty member to perform this task, and he assured the senator that the professor would remain \"quiet\" about their assistance.<ref name=\"Smith 1994 62\"/> Davis believed that assistance provided by West Virginia State would be returned in the form of appropriations.<ref name=\"Smith 1994 62\"/> Author Gerald L. Smith cited Davis' nonpartisan leadership style as being an influence on Rufus B. Atwood, president of [[Kentucky State University|Kentucky State College]].<ref name=\"Smith 1994 62\"/> Davis was also able to secure appropriations for the West Virginia State's buildings and equipment because the state's [[West Virginia Democratic Party|Democratic]] and [[West Virginia Republican Party|Republican]] parties both vied for African American votes.<ref name=\"Trent 1960 ChXI\"/>\n\n== Associated Publishers, Inc. ==\nIn June 1921, Davis and African American leaders including Carter G.
