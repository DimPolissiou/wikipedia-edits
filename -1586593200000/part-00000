After returning to India he took up various civil service works under the [[maharaja]] of the [[princely state]] of [[Baroda State|Baroda]] and became increasingly involved in [[Indian National Congress|nationalist politics in the Indian National Congress]] and the [[Anushilan Samiti|nascent revolutionary movement in Bengal with the Anushilan Samiti]]. He was arrested in the aftermath of a number of bomb outrages linked [[Anushilan samiti|to his organisation]], but in a highly public trial where he [[Emperor vs Aurobindo Ghosh and others|faced charges of treason]], Aurobindo could only be convicted and imprisoned for writing articles against [[British India|British rule]] in India. He was released when no evidence could be provided, following the murder of a prosecution witness, Narendranath Goswami during the trial. During his stay in the jail, he had mystical and spiritual experiences, after which he moved to [[Pondicherry (city)|Pondicherry]], leaving politics for [[Spirituality|spiritual]] work.\n\nAt Pondicherry, Sri Aurobindo developed a spiritual practice he called [[Integral Yoga]]. The central theme of his vision was the evolution of human life into a life [[divinity|divine]]. He believed in a spiritual realisation that not only liberated but transformed human nature, enabling a divine life on earth. In 1926, with the help of his spiritual collaborator, [[Mirra Alfassa]] (referred to as \"The Mother\"), he founded the [[Sri Aurobindo Ashram]].\n\nHis main literary works are ''The Life Divine'', which deals with theoretical aspects of Integral Yoga; ''Synthesis of Yoga'', which deals with practical guidance to Integral Yoga; and ''[[Savitri: A Legend and a Symbol]]'', an [[epic poem]].\n\n== Biography ==\n\n=== Early life time ===\nAurobindo Ghose was born in [[Calcutta]] (now Kolkata), [[Bengal Presidency]], India on 15 August 1872 in a [[Bengali Kayastha]] family that was associated with the village of [[Konnagar]] in the [[Hooghly district|Hoogly]] district. His father, Krishna Dhun Ghose, was then assistant surgeon of [[Rangpur District|Rangpur]] in Bengal and later civil surgeon of [[Khulna]], and a former member of the [[Brahmo Samaj]] religious reform movement who had become enamoured with the then-new idea of [[evolution]] while pursuing medical studies in [[Edinburgh]].<ref>{{cite conference |title= |last=Aall |first=Ingrid |year=1971 |conference= |editor1=Robert Paul Beech |editor2=Mary Jane Beech |book-title=Bengal: change and continuity, Issues 16\u201320 |publisher=Asian Studies Center, Michigan State University |location=East Lansing |page=32 |oclc=258335 |quote=Aurobindo's father, Dr. Krishnadhan Ghose, came from a Kayastha family associated with the village of Konnagar in Hooghly District near Calcutta, Dr. Ghose had his medical training in Edinburgh...}}</ref>{{efn|Aurobindo described his father as a \"tremendous atheist\" but Thakur calls him an agnostic and Heehs believes that he followed his own coda.{{sfnp|Heehs|2008|pp=3\u20137, 10|ps=}}{{sfnp|Thakur|2004|p=3|ps=}}}} His mother was Swarnalata Devi, whose father was [[Rajnarayan Bose|Shri Rajnarayan Bose]], a leading figure in the Samaj. She had been sent to the more salubrious surroundings of Calcutta for Aurobindo's birth. Aurobindo had two elder siblings, Benoybhusan and [[Manmohan Ghose|Manmohan]], a younger sister, Sarojini, and a younger brother, [[Barindra Kumar Ghose|Barindrakumar]] (also referred to as Barin).{{sfnp|Heehs|2008|pp=3\u20137, 10|ps=}}{{sfnp|Thakur|2004|p=3|ps=}}\n\nYoung Aurobindo was brought up speaking English but used [[Hindustani language|Hindustani]] to communicate with servants. Although his family were [[Bengali people|Bengali]], his father believed British culture to be superior. He and his two elder siblings were sent to the English-speaking [[Loreto Convent, Darjeeling|Loreto House]] boarding school in [[Darjeeling]], in part to improve their language skills and in part to distance them from their mother, who had developed a mental illness soon after the birth of her first child. Darjeeling was a centre of British life in India and the school was run by Irish nuns, through which the boys would have been exposed to Christian religious teachings and symbolism.{{sfnp|Heehs|2008|pp=8\u20139|ps=}}\n\n=== England (1879\u20131893) ===\n[[File:Aurobindo.family.jpg|125px|thumb|upright|left|Aurobindo (seated center next to his mother) and his family.

This was a prerequisite for admission to good English schools and, after two years, in 1881, the elder two siblings were enrolled at [[Manchester Grammar School]]. Aurobindo was considered too young for enrolment and he continued his studies with the Drewetts, learning history, Latin, [[French language|French]], geography and arithmetic. Although the Drewetts were told not to teach religion, the boys inevitably were exposed to Christian teachings and events, which generally bored Aurobindo and sometimes repulsed him. There was little contact with his father, who wrote only a few letters to his sons while they were in England, but what communication there was indicated that he was becoming less endeared to the British in India than he had been, on one occasion describing the British Raj as a \"heartless government\".{{sfnp|Heehs|2008|p=14|ps=}}\n\n[[File: Basement of 49 St Stephen's Avenue with Sri Aurobindo Blue Plaque.JPG|thumb|250px|upright| Basement of 49 St Stephen's Avenue, London W12 with Sri Aurobindo [[Blue Plaque]]]]\nDrewett emigrated to Australia in 1884, causing the boys to be uprooted as they went to live with Drewett's mother in London.

The Club's secretary was James Cotton, brother of their father's friend in the Bengal ICS, [[Henry John Stedman Cotton|Henry Cotton]].{{sfnp|Heehs|2008|p=18|ps=}}\n\nBy 1889, Manmohan had determined to pursue a literary career and Benoybhusan had proved himself unequal to the standards necessary for ICS entrance. This meant that only Aurobindo might fulfill his father's aspirations but to do so when his father lacked money required that he studied hard for a scholarship.{{sfnp|Heehs|2008|p=19|ps=}} To become an ICS official, students were required to pass the competitive examination, as well as to study at an English university for two years under probation.

He was later promoted to the post of vice-principal.{{sfnp|Aurobindo|2006|p=42|ps=}} At Baroda, Aurobindo self-studied [[Sanskrit]] and [[Bengali (language)|Bengali]].{{sfnp|Aurobindo|2006|p=43|ps=}}\n[[File:Bande mataram.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Copy of ''Bande Mataram'', September 1907]]\nDuring his stay at Baroda, he had contributed to many articles to ''Indu Prakash'' and had spoken as a chairman of the Baroda college board.{{sfnp|Aurobindo|2006|p=68|ps=}} He started taking an active interest in the politics of India's independence struggle against British rule, working behind the scenes as his position in the Baroda state administration barred him from an overt political activity. He linked up with resistance groups in Bengal and [[Madhya Pradesh]] , while travelling to these states. He established contact with [[Lokmanya Tilak]] and [[Sister Nivedita]].\n\nAurobindo often travelled between Baroda and Bengal, at first in a bid to re-establish links with his parent's families and other Bengali relatives, including his sister Sarojini and brother Barin, and later increased to establish resistance groups across the Presidency. He formally moved to Calcutta in 1906 after the announcement of the [[Partition of Bengal (1905)|Partition of Bengal]]. In 1901, on a visit to Calcutta, he married 14-year-old Mrinalini, the daughter of Bhupal Chandra Bose, a senior official in government service. Aurobindo was 28 at that time. Mrinalini died seventeen years later in December 1918 during the [[1918 flu pandemic|influenza pandemic]].{{sfnp|Heehs|2008|p=53|ps=}}\n\nAurobindo was influenced by studies on rebellion and revolutions against England in medieval France and the revolts in America and Italy. In his public activities he favoured [[Non-cooperation movement|non-co-operation]] and passive resistance; in private he took up secret revolutionary activity as a preparation for open revolt, in case that the passive revolt failed.{{sfnp|Aurobindo|2006|p=71|ps=}}\n\n[[File:Sri Aurobindo presiding over a meeting of the Nationalists after the Surat Congress, with Tilak speaking, 1907.jpg|thumb|upright|Right|Sri Aurobindo seated at the table, with [[Bal Gangadhar Tilak|Tilak]] speaking: Surat session of Congress, 1907]]\nIn Bengal, with Barin's help, he established contacts with revolutionaries, inspiring radicals such as [[Bagha Jatin]] or Jatin Mukherjee and [[Surendranath Tagore|Surendranath]] Tagore. He helped establish a series of youth clubs, including the [[Anushilan Samiti]] of Calcutta in 1902.{{sfnp|Heehs|2008|p=67|ps=}}\n\nAurobindo attended the 1906 [[Indian National Congress|Congress]] meeting headed by [[Dadabhai Naoroji]] and participated as a councillor in forming the fourfold objectives of \"Swaraj, Swadesh, Boycott, and national education\". In 1907 at the Surat session of Congress where moderates and extremists had a major showdown, he led along with extremists along with [[Bal Gangadhar Tilak]]. The Congress split after this session.{{sfnp|Thorpe|2010|p=29|ps=C}} In 1907\u20131908 Aurobindo travelled extensively to [[Pune]], Bombay and Baroda to firm up support for the nationalist cause, giving speeches and meeting with groups. He was arrested again in May 1908 in connection with the [[Alipore Bomb Case]]. He was acquitted in the ensuing trial, following the murder of chief prosecution witness Naren Goswami within jail premises which subsequently led to the case against him collapsing. Aurobindo was subsequently released after a year of isolated incarceration.\n\nOnce out of the prison he started two new publications, ''Karmayogin'' in English and ''Dharma'' in Bengali. He also delivered the [[s:Uttarpara Speech|Uttarpara Speech]] hinting at the transformation of his focus to spiritual matters. The British persecution continued because of his writings in his new journals and in April 1910 Aurobindo moved to Pondicherry, where Britain's [[secret police]] monitored his activities.{{sfnp|Lorenzo|1999|p=70|ps=}}{{sfnp|Heehs|2008|p=217|ps=}}\n\n=== Conversion from politics to spirituality ===\n[[File:Aurobindo jail picture.JPG|thumb|upright|225px|left| Photographs of Aurobindo\nas a prisoner in [[Alipore Jail]], 1908.]]\nIn July 1905 then [[Viceroy of India]], [[Lord Curzon]], [[Partition of Bengal (1905)|partitioned Bengal]]. This sparked an outburst of public anger against the British, leading to civil unrest and a nationalist campaign by groups of revolutionaries that included Aurobindo. In 1908, [[Khudiram Bose]] and [[Prafulla Chaki]] attempted to kill Magistrate Kingsford, a judge known for handing down particularly severe sentences against nationalists. However, the bomb thrown at his horse carriage missed its target and instead landed in another carriage and killed two British women, the wife and daughter of barrister [[Pringle Kennedy]]. Aurobindo was also arrested on charges of planning and overseeing the attack and imprisoned in solitary confinement in [[Alipore Jail]]. The trial of the Alipore Bomb Case lasted for a year, but eventually, he was acquitted on 6 May 1909. His defence counsel was [[Chittaranjan Das]].{{sfnp|Aurobindo|2006|p=86|ps=}}\n\nDuring this period in the Jail, his view of life was radically changed due to spiritual experiences and realizations. Consequently, his aim went far beyond the service and liberation of the country. {{sfnp|Aurobindo|2006|p=61|ps=}}\n\nAurobindo said he was \"visited\" by [[Vivekananda]] in the Alipore Jail: \"It is a fact that I was hearing constantly the voice of Vivekananda speaking to me for a fortnight in the jail in my solitary meditation and felt his presence.\"{{sfnp|Aurobindo|2006|p=98|ps=}}\n\nIn his autobiographical notes, Aurobindo said he felt a vast sense of calmness when he first came back to India. He could not explain this and continued to have various such experiences from time to time. He knew nothing of yoga at that time and started his practice of it without a teacher, except for some rules that he learned from Ganganath, a friend who was a disciple of [[Brahmananda]].{{sfnp|Aurobindo|2006|p=110|ps=}} <!--When Sri Aurobindo became involved with Congress and ''Vande Mataram'', Barin had continued to meet patriotic youngsters for recruitment for such a plan.{{clarify|reason=what plan?}}--> In 1907, Barin introduced Aurobindo to Vishnu Bhaskar Lele, a Maharashtrian yogi. Aurobindo was influenced by the guidance he got from the yogi, who had instructed Aurobindo to depend on an inner guide and any kind of external guru or guidance would not be required.{{sfnp|Heehs|2008|pp=142\u2013143|ps=}}\n\nIn 1910 Aurobindo withdrew himself from all political activities and went into hiding at [[Chandannagar]] in the house of [[Motilal Roy]], while the British were trying to prosecute him for sedition on the basis of a signed article titled 'To My Countrymen', published in ''Karmayogin''. As Aurobindo disappeared from view, the warrant was held back and the prosecution postponed. Aurobindo manoeuvred the police into open action and a warrant was issued on 4 April 1910, but the warrant could not be executed because on that date he had reached Pondicherry, then a [[French colony]].{{sfnp|Aurobindo|2006|p=101|ps=}} The warrant against Aurobindo was withdrawn.\n\n=== Pondicherry (1910\u20131950) ===\nIn Pondicherry, Sri Aurobindo dedicated himself to his spiritual and philosophical pursuits. In 1914, after four years of secluded yoga, he started a monthly philosophical magazine called ''[[Arya (journal)|Arya]]''. This ceased publication in 1921. Many years later, he revised some of these works before they were published in book form. Some of the book series derived out of this publication was ''The Life Divine'', ''The Synthesis of Yoga'', ''Essays on The Gita'', ''The Secret of The Veda'', ''Hymns to the Mystic Fire'', ''The Upanishads'', ''The Renaissance in India'', ''War and Self-determination'', ''The Human Cycle'', ''The Ideal of Human Unity'' and ''The Future Poetry'' were published in this magazine.{{sfnp|Thakur|2004|pp=31\u201333|ps=}}\n\nAt the beginning of his stay at Pondicherry, there were few followers, but with time their numbers grew, resulting in the formation of the [[Sri Aurobindo Ashram]] in 1926.<ref name=\"Sketch\">{{citation |title=Sri Aurobindo: A Life Sketch |series=Sri Aurobindo Birth Centenary Library |volume=30 |url=http://www.sriaurobindoashram.org/ashram/sriauro/life_sketch.php |accessdate=1 January 2013 }}</ref> From 1926 he started to sign himself as ''Sri Aurobindo'', ''[[Sri]]'' (meaning holy in Sanskrit) being commonly used as an [[honorific]].{{sfnp|Heehs|2008|p=347|ps=: Sri Aurobindo without the surname seems to have first appeared in print in articles published in Chandernagore in 1920.

When he died in 1950, she continued their spiritual work, directed the ashram, and guided their disciples.{{sfnp|Jones|Ryan|2007|pp=292\u2013293|ps=}}\n\n== Philosophy and spiritual vision ==\n{{Main|Integral yoga}}\n{| class=\"wikitable collapsible collapsed\" style=\"float:right;\"\n|-\n! colspan=6 | Aurobindo's model of Being and Evolution{{sfn|Wilber|1980|p=263}}{{sfn|Sharma|1991}}\n\n|- header row 2\n| colspan=5 align=center | '''Levels of Being'''\n| rowspan=2 | '''Development'''\n\n|- header row 3\n| align=center           | '''Overall'''\n| align=center colspan=2 | '''Outer Being'''\n| align=center           | '''Inner Being'''\n| align=center           | '''Psychic Being'''\n\n|- Universalizing\n| Aurobindo-Overall rowspan=2 align=center       | Supermind\n| Aurobindo-OIP rowspan=2 colspan=4 align=center | [[Supermind (Integral yoga)|Supermind]]\n| Aurobindo-Development                          | Gnostic Man\n\n|- 1\n| Aurobindo-Development | Supra-mentalisation\n\n|- 2\n| Aurobindo-Overall rowspan=5 align=center | Mind\n| Aurobindo-Outer colspan=1 rowspan=4      |\n| Aurobindo-IP colspan=3 align=center      | Overmind\n| Aurobindo-Development rowspan=4          | Psychisation<br />and<br />Spiritualisation\n\n|- 3\n| Aurobindo-IP colspan=3 align=center | Intuition\n\n|- 4\n| Aurobindo-IP colspan=3 align=center | Illuminated Mind\n\n|- 5\n| Aurobindo-IP colspan=3 align=center | Higher Mind\n\n|- 6\n| Aurobindo-Sub rowspan=1 align=center              | Subconscient<br />mind\n| Aurobindo-Outer colspan=1 rowspan =1 align=center | Mind proper\n| Aurobindo-I rowspan=1 align=center                | Subliminal<br />(inner)<br />mind\n| Aurobindo-P rowspan=3                             |\n| Aurobindo-D rowspan=3 align=center                | Evolution\n\n|- 10\n| Aurobindo-Overall         | Vital\n| Aurobindo-Sub             | Subconsc.<br />Vital\n| Aurobindo-Outer           | Vital''Italic text''\n| Aurobindo-Inner colspan=1 | Subl.<br />(inner)<br />Vital\n\n|- 11\n| Aurobindo-Overall         | Physical\n| Aurobindo-sub             | Subconsc.<br />Physical\n| Aurobindo-Outer           | Physical\n| Aurobindo-Inner colspan=1 | Subl.

Instead of positing that the world we experience is an illusion (''[[Maya (illusion)|m\u0101y\u0101]]'')'','' Aurobindo argues that world can evolve and become a new world with new species, far above the human species just as human species have evolved after the animal species. As such he argued that the end goal of spiritual practice could not merely be a liberation from the world into Samadhi but would also be that of descent of the Divine into the world in order to transform it into a Divine existence. Thus, this constituted the purpose of Integral Yoga.<ref>Aurobindo, Sri. ''The Synthesis of Yoga.'' Lotus Press, 1996. P. 7-8</ref> Regarding the involution of consciousness in matter, he wrote that: \"This descent, this sacrifice of the Purusha, the Divine Soul submitting itself to Force and Matter so that it may inform and illuminate them is the seed of redemption of this world of Inconscience and Ignorance.\"<ref>Aurobindo, Sri. ''The Synthesis of Yoga.'' Lotus Press, 1996.  p. 106.</ref>\n\nSri Aurobindo believed that [[Darwinism]] merely describes a phenomenon of the evolution of matter into life, but does not explain the reason behind it, while he finds life to be already present in matter, because all of existence is a manifestation of ''Brahman''. He argues that nature (which he interpreted as divine) has evolved life out of matter and the mind out of life.  All of existence, he argues, is attempting to manifest to the level of the supermind \u2013 that evolution [[teleology|had a purpose]].{{sfnp|Aurobindo|2005|p=5|ps=}}  He stated that he found the task of understanding the [[Metaphysics|nature of reality]] arduous and difficult to justify by immediate tangible results.{{sfnp|Aurobindo|2005|p=7|ps=}}\n\n=== Supermind ===\n{{Main|Supermind (Integral yoga)}}\nAt the centre of Aurobindo's metaphysical system is the supermind, an intermediary power between the unmanifested Brahman and the manifested world.<ref>Aurobindo, Sri. ''The Life Divine'' Lotus Press, 1990. P. 132.</ref> Aurobindo claims that the supermind is not completely alien to us and can be realized within ourselves as it is always present within mind since the latter is in reality identical with the former and contains it as a potentiality within itself.<ref>Aurobindo, Sri. ''The Life Divine'' Lotus Press, 1990., P. 132-133</ref> Aurobindo does not portray supermind as an original invention of his own but believes it can be found in the Vedas and that the Vedic Gods represent powers of the supermind<ref>Aurobindo, Sri. ''The Life Divine'' Lotus Press, 1990., P. 134</ref> In ''The Integral Yoga'' he declares that \"By the supermind is meant the full Truth-Consciousness of the Divine Nature in which there can be no place for the principle of division and ignorance; it is always a full light and knowledge superior to all mental substance or mental movement.\"<ref>Aurobindo, Sri. ''The Integral Yoga.''Lotus Press, 1993. P. 65.</ref> Supermind is a bridge between Sachchidananda and the lower manifestation and it is only through the supramental that mind, life and body can be spiritually transformed as opposed to through Sachchidananda <ref>Aurobindo, Sri. ''The Integral Yoga.''Lotus Press, 1993., P. 65-655.</ref> The descent of supermind will mean the creation of a supramental race <ref>Aurobindo, Sri. ''The Integral Yoga.''Lotus Press, 1993., P. 68.</ref>\n\n=== Affinity with Western philosophy ===\nIn his writings, talks, and letters Sri Aurobindo has referred to several European philosophers with whose basic concepts he was familiar, commenting on their ideas and discussing the question of affinity to his own line of thought. Thus he wrote a long essay on the Greek philosopher [[Heraclitus]]<ref>Complete Works of Sri Aurobindo (CWSA) vol. 13, ''Essays in Philosophy and Yoga''\n, Pondicherry, Sri Aurobindo Ashram 1995, pp. 215\u201358</ref> and mentioned especially [[Plato]], [[Plotinus]], [[Nietzsche]] and [[Bergson]] as thinkers in whom he was interested because of their more intuitive approach.{{sfn|Huchzermeyer|2016|ps= Ch. 2\u20134, 7 and 8}} On the other hand, he felt little attraction for the philosophy of  [[Kant]] or [[Hegel]].<ref>CWSA vol. 36, ''Autobiographical Notes'', p. 112.</ref> Several studies<ref>One of the more comprehensive titles is: K.D. Sethna. ''The Spirituality of the Future. A Search apropos of R.C. Zaehner\u2019s Study in Sri Aurobindo and Teilhard de Chardin.'' London 1981</ref> have shown a remarkable closeness to the evolutionary thought of [[Teilhard de Chardin]], whom he did not know, whereas the latter came to know of Sri Aurobindo at a late stage. After reading some chapters of ''The Life Divine'', he is reported to have said that Sri Aurobindo's vision of evolution was basically the same as his own, though stated for Asian readers.{{sfn|Huchzermeyer|2016|p=0127}}<ref>Sethna, K.D. (1981). ''The Spirituality of the Future. A Search apropos of R.C. Zaehner\u2019s Study in Sri Aurobindo and Teilhard de Chardin.'' Fairleigh Dickinson University Press. p. 257. {{ISBN|978-1611470703}}.</ref>\n\nSeveral scholars have discovered significant similarities in the thought of Sri Aurobindo and Hegel. Steve Odin has discussed this subject comprehensively in a comparative study.<ref>''Sri Aurobindo and Hegel on the Involution-Evolution of Absolute Spirit.'' Philosophy East and West, Vol. 31, No. 2 (Apr. 1981), pp. 179\u2013191</ref> Odin writes that Sri Aurobindo \"has appropriated Hegel\u2019s notion of an Absolute Spirit and employed it to radically restructure the architectonic framework of the ancient Hindu Vedanta system in contemporary terms.\"<ref>Odin, p.179. (Sri Aurobindo himself denied to be influenced by Hegel. See A.B. Purani, ''Evening Talks with Sri Aurobindo.'' Pondicherry, Sri Aurobindo Ashram 2001, p. 106)</ref> In his analysis Odin arrives at the conclusion that \"both philosophers similarly envision world creation as the progressive self-manifestation and evolutionary ascent of a universal consciousness in its journey toward Self-realization.\"<ref name=\"Odin, p. 186\">Odin, p. 186</ref> He points out that in contrast to the deterministic and continuous dialectal unfolding of Absolute Reason by the mechanism of thesis-antithesis-synthesis or affirmation-negation-integration, \"Sri Aurobindo argues for a creative, emergent mode of evolution.\"<ref name=\"Odin, p. 186\"/> In his r\u00e9sum\u00e9 Odin states that Sri Aurobindo has overcome the ahistorical world-vision of traditional Hinduism and presented a concept which allows for a genuine advance and novelty.<ref>Odin, p. 190</ref>\n\n=== Importance of the Upanishads ===\nAlthough Sri Aurobindo was familiar with the most important lines of thought in Western philosophy, he did not acknowledge their influence on his own writings.<ref>''Evening Talks with Sri Aurobindo'', p. 106</ref> He wrote that his philosophy \"was formed first by the study of the [[Upanishads]] and the Gita\u2026 They were the basis of my first practice of Yoga.\" With the help of his readings he tried to move on to actual experience, \"and it was on this experience that later on I founded my philosophy, not on ideas themselves.\u201d<ref>CWSA vol. 36, ''Autobiographical Writings'', p. 113</ref>\n\nHe assumes that the seers of the Upanishads had basically the same approach and gives some details of his vision of the past in a long passage in ''The Renaissance of India''. \"The Upanishads have been the acknowledged source of numerous profound philosophies and religions,\" he writes. Even [[Buddhism]] with all its developments was only a \"restatement\" from a new standpoint and with fresh terms. And, furthermore, the ideas of the Upanishads \"can be rediscovered in much of the thought of [[Pythagoras]] and Plato and form the profound part of [[Neo-platonism]] and [[Gnosticism]]...\" Finally, the larger part of German metaphysics \"is little more in substance than an intellectual development of great realities more spiritually seen in this ancient teaching.\"<ref>CWSA, vol. 20, p. 330</ref> When once he was asked by a disciple whether Plato got some of his ideas from Indian books, he responded that though something of the philosophy of India got through \"by means of Pythagoras and others\", he assumed that Plato got most of his ideas from intuition.<ref>CWSA vol. 27, ''Letters on Poetry and Art'', p. 520.</ref>\n\nSri Aurobindo's indebtedness to the Indian tradition also becomes obvious through his placing a large number of quotations from the [[Rig Veda]], the [[Upanishads]] and the [[Bhagavadgita]] at the beginning of the chapters in ''The Life Divine'', showing the connection of his own thought to [[Veda]] and [[Vedanta]].{{sfn|Huchzermeyer|2016|p=10}}{{sfnp|Heehs|2008|p=276}}\n\nThe ''Isha Upanishad'' is considered to be one of the most important and more accessible writings of Sri Aurobindo.{{sfnp|Heehs|2008|p=267}} Before he published his final translation and analysis, he wrote ten incomplete commentaries.<ref>CWSA vol. 17, Publisher\u2019s Note</ref>  In a key passage he points out that the Brahman or Absolute is both the Stable and the Moving. \"We must see it in eternal and immutable Spirit and in all the changing manifestations of universe and relativity.\"{{sfnp|Heehs|2008|p=267}}<ref>CWSA 17:30</ref>  Sri Aurobindo's biographer K.R.S. Iyengar quotes R.S. Mugali as stating that Sri Aurobindo might have obtained in this Upanishad the thought-seed which later grew into ''The Life Divine''.<ref>K. R. Srinivasa Iyengar (1972) ''Sri Aurobindo \u2013 A Biography and a history.'' Pondicherry, Sri Aurobindo Ashram. p. 441.</ref>\n\n=== Synthesis and integration ===\n[[Sisir Kumar Maitra]], who was a leading exponent of Sri Aurobindo's Philosophy,{{sfn|Huchzermeyer|2016|p=85}}  has referred to the issue of external influences and written that Sri Aurobindo does not mention names, but \"as one reads his books one cannot fail to notice how thorough is his grasp of the great Western philosophers of the present age...\" Although he is Indian one should not \"underrate the influence of Western thought upon him. This influence is there, very clearly visible, but Sri Aurobindo... has not allowed himself to be dominated by it. He has made full use of Western thought, but he has made use of it for the purpose of building up his own system...\"<ref>Maitra, S.K. (1988): ''The Meeting of the East and the West in Sri Aurobindo\u2019s Philosophy.'' Pondicherry, Sri Aurobindo Ashram. p. 49. {{ISBN|978-8170580782}}</ref> Thus Maitra, like Steve Odin,{{sfn|Huchzermeyer|2016|p=78}} sees Sri Aurobindo not only in the tradition and context of Indian, but also Western philosophy and assumes he may have adopted some elements from the latter for his synthesis.\n\nR. Puligandla supports this viewpoint in his book ''Fundamentals of Indian Philosophy''. He describes Sri Aurobindo's philosophy as \"an original synthesis of the Indian and Western traditions.\" \"He integrates in a unique fashion the great social, political and scientific achievements of the modern West with the ancient and profound spiritual insights of [[Hinduism]]. The vision that powers the life divine of Aurobindo is none other than the Upanishadic vision of the unity of all existence.\"<ref name=Puligandla>{{cite book|author=Ramakrishna Puligandla|title=Fundamentals of Indian Philosophy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LJ_0OAAACAAJ|year=1997|publisher=D.K. Printworld|isbn=978-81-246-0087-0|pages=267\u2013268}}</ref>\n\nPuligandla believes that the Western influence also becomes evident through Sri Aurobindo's critical position vis-\u00e0-vis [[Adi Shankara|Shankara]]<ref>For Sri Aurobindo\u2019s critique, see, for instance, CWSA vol. 17, ''Isha Upanishad'', pp. 498\u201399. There he says that Shankara\u2019s world-negative approach \"has overshadowed for centuries the lives and souls of hundreds of millions of human beings.\" However, he also recognized him as \"one of the mightiest of metaphysical intellects.\" (''Isha Upanishad'', p. 497)</ref> and his assumption that the latter teaches through his Mayavada or Illusionism that the world is unreal and illusory. Puligandla objects, \"nowhere does Shankara say that the world is unreal and illusory. Quite the contrary, through the concept of sublation he teaches that the world is neither real nor unreal. That this is indeed his teaching is further borne out by his distinction between lower and higher truths.\" Therefore, Puligandla concludes that \"Aurobindo's characterization of Shankara's Vedanta as a world-negating philosophy is unfounded.\" He believes that Sri Aurobindo in his endeavour to synthesize Hindu and Western modes of thought has wrongly identified Shankara's Mayavada with the subjective idealism of [[George Berkeley]], \"which undoubtedly stands in sharp contrast to the realism of the Western philosophical tradition in general.\" Nonetheless, Puligandla believes that Sri Aurobindo was \"a great philosopher-mystic\" with a significant vision of man and the world.<ref name=Puligandla/>\n\nSri Aurobindo's critique of Shankara is supported by U. C. Dubey in his paper titled ''Integralism: The Distinctive Feature of Sri Aurobindo\u2019s Philosophy.'' He starts by summarizing what he considers to be Sri Aurobindo's most important contributions to philosophy and mentions at first his integral view of Reality. \"The creative force or 'cit-\u015bakti' is regarded by him as one with the Absolute. Thus there is no opposition between the Absolute and its creative force in his system.\" Next Dubey refers to Sri Aurobindo's  conception of the [[supermind (Integral yoga)|supermind]] as the mediatory principle between the Absolute and the finite world and quotes S.K. Maitra stating that this conception \"is the pivot round which the whole of Sri Aurobindo\u2019s philosophy moves.\"<ref name=Dubey>U. C. Dubey (2007) \"Integralism the distinctive feature of Sri Aurobindo's philosophy\", pp. 25\u201327, Ch. 2 in ''Understanding Thoughts of Sri Aurobindo''. Indrani Sanyal and Krishna Roy (eds.). D K Printworld. New Delhi. {{ISBN|9788124604021}}</ref>\n\nDubey proceeds to analyse the approach of the Shankarites and believes that they follow an inadequate kind of logic that does not do justice to the challenge of tackling the problem of the Absolute, which cannot be known by finite reason. With the help of the finite reason, he says, \"we are bound to determine the nature of reality as one or many, being or becoming. But Sri Aurobindo's Integral Advaitism reconciles all apparently different aspects of Existence in an all-embracing unity of the Absolute.\"  Next, Dubey explains that for Sri Aurobindo there is a higher reason, the \"logic of the infinite\" in which his integralism is rooted, and expounds this concept by presenting some quotations from ''The Life Divine''. In concluding he notes critically \"that Sri Aurobindo does not explain sufficiently the nature of the logic of the infinite.\" Nevertheless, \"the way he proposes this logic is undoubtedly his unique contribution in the field of Absolutism.\"<ref name=Dubey/>\n\n== Legacy ==\n[[File:Sri Aurobindo 1964 stamp of India.jpg|thumb|Sri Aurobindo on a 1964 stamp of India]]\nSri Aurobindo was an [[Indian nationalist movement|Indian nationalist]] but is best known for his philosophy on human evolution and Integral Yoga.{{sfnp|McDermott|1994|p=11|ps=}}\n\n=== Influence ===\nHis influence has been wide-ranging. In India, [[Shishir Kumar Maitra|S. K. Maitra]], Anilbaran Roy and [[D. P. Chattopadhyaya]] commented on Sri Aurobindo's work. Writers on [[esotericism]] and traditional wisdom, such as [[Mircea Eliade]], [[Paul Brunton]], and [[Rene Guenon]], all saw him as an authentic representative of the Indian spiritual tradition.{{sfnp|Heehs|2008|p=379|ps=}} Though [[Rene Guenon]] thought Sri Aurobindo's thoughts were betrayed by some of his followers and that some works published under his name were not authentic, since not traditional. <ref>Ren\u00e9 Gu\u00e9non, Etude sur l'hindouisme, Les  \u00c9ditions  traditionnelles, 1989, nouvelle \u00e9dition, p268</ref> <ref>http://classiques.uqac.ca/classiques/guenon_rene/Etudes_sur_hindouisme/Etudes_sur_hindouisme.pdf</ref>\n\n[[Haridas Chaudhuri]] and [[Frederic Spiegelberg]]<ref>Haridas Chaudhuri and Frederic Spiegelberg (1960) ''The integral philosophy of Sri Aurobindo: a commemorative symposium'', Allen & Unwin.</ref> were among those who were inspired by Aurobindo, who worked on the newly formed [[American Academy of Asian Studies]] in [[San Francisco]].

After returning to India he took up various civil service works under the [[maharaja]] of the [[princely state]] of [[Baroda State|Baroda]] and became increasingly involved in [[Indian National Congress|nationalist politics in the Indian National Congress]] and the [[Anushilan Samiti|nascent revolutionary movement in Bengal with the Anushilan Samiti]]. He was arrested in the aftermath of a number of bomb outrages linked [[Anushilan samiti|to his organisation]], but in a highly public trial where he [[Emperor vs Aurobindo Ghosh and others|faced charges of treason]], Aurobindo could only be convicted and imprisoned for writing articles against [[British India|British rule]] in India. He was released when no evidence could be provided, following the murder of a prosecution witness, Narendranath Goswami during the trial. During his stay in the jail, he had mystical and spiritual experiences, after which he moved to [[Pondicherry (city)|Pondicherry]], leaving politics for [[Spirituality|spiritual]] work.\n\nAt Pondicherry, Sri Aurobindo developed a spiritual practice he called [[Integral Yoga]]. The central theme of his vision was the evolution of human life into a life [[divinity|divine]]. He believed in a spiritual realisation that not only liberated but transformed human nature, enabling a divine life on earth. In 1926, with the help of his spiritual collaborator, [[Mirra Alfassa]] (referred to as \"The Mother\"), he founded the [[Sri Aurobindo Ashram]].\n\nHis main literary works are ''The Life Divine'', which deals with theoretical aspects of Integral Yoga; ''Synthesis of Yoga'', which deals with practical guidance to Integral Yoga; and ''[[Savitri: A Legend and a Symbol]]'', an [[epic poem]].\n\n== Biography ==\n\n=== Early life time ===\nAurobindo Ghose was born in [[Calcutta]] (now Kolkata), [[Bengal Presidency]], India on 15 August 1872 in a [[Bengali Kayastha]] family that was associated with the village of [[Konnagar]] in the [[Hooghly district|Hoogly]] district. His father, Krishna Dhun Ghose, was then assistant surgeon of [[Rangpur District|Rangpur]] in Bengal and later civil surgeon of [[Khulna]], and a former member of the [[Brahmo Samaj]] religious reform movement who had become enamoured with the then-new idea of [[evolution]] while pursuing medical studies in [[Edinburgh]].<ref>{{cite conference |title= |last=Aall |first=Ingrid |year=1971 |conference= |editor1=Robert Paul Beech |editor2=Mary Jane Beech |book-title=Bengal: change and continuity, Issues 16\u201320 |publisher=Asian Studies Center, Michigan State University |location=East Lansing |page=32 |oclc=258335 |quote=Aurobindo's father, Dr. Krishnadhan Ghose, came from a Kayastha family associated with the village of Konnagar in Hooghly District near Calcutta, Dr. Ghose had his medical training in Edinburgh...}}</ref>{{efn|Aurobindo described his father as a \"tremendous atheist\" but Thakur calls him an agnostic and Heehs believes that he followed his own coda.{{sfnp|Heehs|2008|pp=3\u20137, 10|ps=}}{{sfnp|Thakur|2004|p=3|ps=}}}} His mother was Swarnalata Devi, whose father was [[Rajnarayan Bose|Shri Rajnarayan Bose]], a leading figure in the Samaj. She had been sent to the more salubrious surroundings of Calcutta for Aurobindo's birth.

Although his family were [[Bengali people|Bengali]], his father believed British culture to be superior. He and his two elder siblings were sent to the English-speaking [[Loreto Convent, Darjeeling|Loreto House]] boarding school in [[Darjeeling]], in part to improve their language skills and in part to distance them from their mother, who had developed a mental illness soon after the birth of her first child. Darjeeling was a centre of British life in India and the school was run by Irish nuns, through which the boys would have been exposed to Christian religious teachings and symbolism.{{sfnp|Heehs|2008|pp=8\u20139|ps=}}\n\n=== England (1879\u20131893) ===\n[[File:Aurobindo.family.jpg|125px|thumb|upright|left|Aurobindo (seated center next to his mother) and his family.

Aurobindo was considered too young for enrolment and he continued his studies with the Drewetts, learning history, Latin, [[French language|French]], geography and arithmetic. Although the Drewetts were told not to teach religion, the boys inevitably were exposed to Christian teachings and events, which generally bored Aurobindo and sometimes repulsed him. There was little contact with his father, who wrote only a few letters to his sons while they were in England, but what communication there was indicated that he was becoming less endeared to the British in India than he had been, on one occasion describing the British Raj as a \"heartless government\".{{sfnp|Heehs|2008|p=14|ps=}}\n\n[[File: Basement of 49 St Stephen's Avenue with Sri Aurobindo Blue Plaque.JPG|thumb|250px|upright| Basement of 49 St Stephen's Avenue, London W12 with Sri Aurobindo [[Blue Plaque]]]]\nDrewett emigrated to Australia in 1884, causing the boys to be uprooted as they went to live with Drewett's mother in London.

He established contact with [[Lokmanya Tilak]] and [[Sister Nivedita]].\n\nAurobindo often travelled between Baroda and Bengal, at first in a bid to re-establish links with his parent's families and other Bengali relatives, including his sister Sarojini and brother Barin, and later increased to establish resistance groups across the Presidency. He formally moved to Calcutta in 1906 after the announcement of the [[Partition of Bengal (1905)|Partition of Bengal]]. In 1901, on a visit to Calcutta, he married 14-year-old Mrinalini, the daughter of Bhupal Chandra Bose, a senior official in government service. Aurobindo was 28 at that time.

This sparked an outburst of public anger against the British, leading to civil unrest and a nationalist campaign by groups of revolutionaries that included Aurobindo. In 1908, [[Khudiram Bose]] and [[Prafulla Chaki]] attempted to kill Magistrate Kingsford, a judge known for handing down particularly severe sentences against nationalists. However, the bomb thrown at his horse carriage missed its target and instead landed in another carriage and killed two British women, the wife and daughter of barrister [[Pringle Kennedy]]. Aurobindo was also arrested on charges of planning and overseeing the attack and imprisoned in solitary confinement in [[Alipore Jail]]. The trial of the Alipore Bomb Case lasted for a year, but eventually, he was acquitted on 6 May 1909. His defence counsel was [[Chittaranjan Das]].{{sfnp|Aurobindo|2006|p=86|ps=}}\n\nDuring this period in the Jail, his view of life was radically changed due to spiritual experiences and realizations. Consequently, his aim went far beyond the service and liberation of the country. {{sfnp|Aurobindo|2006|p=61|ps=}}\n\nAurobindo said he was \"visited\" by [[Vivekananda]] in the Alipore Jail: \"It is a fact that I was hearing constantly the voice of Vivekananda speaking to me for a fortnight in the jail in my solitary meditation and felt his presence.\"{{sfnp|Aurobindo|2006|p=98|ps=}}\n\nIn his autobiographical notes, Aurobindo said he felt a vast sense of calmness when he first came back to India. He could not explain this and continued to have various such experiences from time to time. He knew nothing of yoga at that time and started his practice of it without a teacher, except for some rules that he learned from Ganganath, a friend who was a disciple of [[Brahmananda]].{{sfnp|Aurobindo|2006|p=110|ps=}} <!--When Sri Aurobindo became involved with Congress and ''Vande Mataram'', Barin had continued to meet patriotic youngsters for recruitment for such a plan.{{clarify|reason=what plan?}}--> In 1907, Barin introduced Aurobindo to Vishnu Bhaskar Lele, a Maharashtrian yogi.

As Aurobindo disappeared from view, the warrant was held back and the prosecution postponed. Aurobindo manoeuvred the police into open action and a warrant was issued on 4 April 1910, but the warrant could not be executed because on that date he had reached Pondicherry, then a [[French colony]].{{sfnp|Aurobindo|2006|p=101|ps=}} The warrant against Aurobindo was withdrawn.\n\n=== Pondicherry (1910\u20131950) ===\nIn Pondicherry, Sri Aurobindo dedicated himself to his spiritual and philosophical pursuits. In 1914, after four years of secluded yoga, he started a monthly philosophical magazine called ''[[Arya (journal)|Arya]]''. This ceased publication in 1921. Many years later, he revised some of these works before they were published in book form.

Instead of positing that the world we experience is an illusion (''[[Maya (illusion)|m\u0101y\u0101]]'')'','' Aurobindo argues that world can evolve and become a new world with new species, far above the human species just as human species have evolved after the animal species. As such he argued that the end goal of spiritual practice could not merely be a liberation from the world into Samadhi but would also be that of descent of the Divine into the world in order to transform it into a Divine existence. Thus, this constituted the purpose of Integral Yoga.<ref>Aurobindo, Sri. ''The Synthesis of Yoga.'' Lotus Press, 1996. P. 7-8</ref> Regarding the involution of consciousness in matter, he wrote that: \"This descent, this sacrifice of the Purusha, the Divine Soul submitting itself to Force and Matter so that it may inform and illuminate them is the seed of redemption of this world of Inconscience and Ignorance.\"<ref>Aurobindo, Sri. ''The Synthesis of Yoga.'' Lotus Press, 1996.  p. 106.</ref>\n\nSri Aurobindo believed that [[Darwinism]] merely describes a phenomenon of the evolution of matter into life, but does not explain the reason behind it, while he finds life to be already present in matter, because all of existence is a manifestation of ''Brahman''. He argues that nature (which he interpreted as divine) has evolved life out of matter and the mind out of life.  All of existence, he argues, is attempting to manifest to the level of the supermind \u2013 that evolution [[teleology|had a purpose]].{{sfnp|Aurobindo|2005|p=5|ps=}}  He stated that he found the task of understanding the [[Metaphysics|nature of reality]] arduous and difficult to justify by immediate tangible results.{{sfnp|Aurobindo|2005|p=7|ps=}}\n\n=== Supermind ===\n{{Main|Supermind (Integral yoga)}}\nAt the centre of Aurobindo's metaphysical system is the supermind, an intermediary power between the unmanifested Brahman and the manifested world.<ref>Aurobindo, Sri. ''The Life Divine'' Lotus Press, 1990. P. 132.</ref> Aurobindo claims that the supermind is not completely alien to us and can be realized within ourselves as it is always present within mind since the latter is in reality identical with the former and contains it as a potentiality within itself.<ref>Aurobindo, Sri. ''The Life Divine'' Lotus Press, 1990., P. 132-133</ref> Aurobindo does not portray supermind as an original invention of his own but believes it can be found in the Vedas and that the Vedic Gods represent powers of the supermind<ref>Aurobindo, Sri. ''The Life Divine'' Lotus Press, 1990., P. 134</ref> In ''The Integral Yoga'' he declares that \"By the supermind is meant the full Truth-Consciousness of the Divine Nature in which there can be no place for the principle of division and ignorance; it is always a full light and knowledge superior to all mental substance or mental movement.\"<ref>Aurobindo, Sri. ''The Integral Yoga.''Lotus Press, 1993. P. 65.</ref> Supermind is a bridge between Sachchidananda and the lower manifestation and it is only through the supramental that mind, life and body can be spiritually transformed as opposed to through Sachchidananda <ref>Aurobindo, Sri.

''The Integral Yoga.''Lotus Press, 1993., P. 68.</ref>\n\n=== Affinity with Western philosophy ===\nIn his writings, talks, and letters Sri Aurobindo has referred to several European philosophers with whose basic concepts he was familiar, commenting on their ideas and discussing the question of affinity to his own line of thought. Thus he wrote a long essay on the Greek philosopher [[Heraclitus]]<ref>Complete Works of Sri Aurobindo (CWSA) vol. 13, ''Essays in Philosophy and Yoga''\n, Pondicherry, Sri Aurobindo Ashram 1995, pp. 215\u201358</ref> and mentioned especially [[Plato]], [[Plotinus]], [[Nietzsche]] and [[Bergson]] as thinkers in whom he was interested because of their more intuitive approach.{{sfn|Huchzermeyer|2016|ps= Ch. 2\u20134, 7 and 8}} On the other hand, he felt little attraction for the philosophy of  [[Kant]] or [[Hegel]].<ref>CWSA vol. 36, ''Autobiographical Notes'', p. 112.</ref> Several studies<ref>One of the more comprehensive titles is: K.D. Sethna. ''The Spirituality of the Future. A Search apropos of R.C. Zaehner\u2019s Study in Sri Aurobindo and Teilhard de Chardin.'' London 1981</ref> have shown a remarkable closeness to the evolutionary thought of [[Teilhard de Chardin]], whom he did not know, whereas the latter came to know of Sri Aurobindo at a late stage. After reading some chapters of ''The Life Divine'', he is reported to have said that Sri Aurobindo's vision of evolution was basically the same as his own, though stated for Asian readers.{{sfn|Huchzermeyer|2016|p=0127}}<ref>Sethna, K.D.

Steve Odin has discussed this subject comprehensively in a comparative study.<ref>''Sri Aurobindo and Hegel on the Involution-Evolution of Absolute Spirit.'' Philosophy East and West, Vol. 31, No. 2 (Apr. 1981), pp. 179\u2013191</ref> Odin writes that Sri Aurobindo \"has appropriated Hegel\u2019s notion of an Absolute Spirit and employed it to radically restructure the architectonic framework of the ancient Hindu Vedanta system in contemporary terms.\"<ref>Odin, p.179. (Sri Aurobindo himself denied to be influenced by Hegel. See A.B. Purani, ''Evening Talks with Sri Aurobindo.'' Pondicherry, Sri Aurobindo Ashram 2001, p. 106)</ref> In his analysis Odin arrives at the conclusion that \"both philosophers similarly envision world creation as the progressive self-manifestation and evolutionary ascent of a universal consciousness in its journey toward Self-realization.\"<ref name=\"Odin, p. 186\">Odin, p. 186</ref> He points out that in contrast to the deterministic and continuous dialectal unfolding of Absolute Reason by the mechanism of thesis-antithesis-synthesis or affirmation-negation-integration, \"Sri Aurobindo argues for a creative, emergent mode of evolution.\"<ref name=\"Odin, p. 186\"/> In his r\u00e9sum\u00e9 Odin states that Sri Aurobindo has overcome the ahistorical world-vision of traditional Hinduism and presented a concept which allows for a genuine advance and novelty.<ref>Odin, p. 190</ref>\n\n=== Importance of the Upanishads ===\nAlthough Sri Aurobindo was familiar with the most important lines of thought in Western philosophy, he did not acknowledge their influence on his own writings.<ref>''Evening Talks with Sri Aurobindo'', p. 106</ref> He wrote that his philosophy \"was formed first by the study of the [[Upanishads]] and the Gita\u2026 They were the basis of my first practice of Yoga.\" With the help of his readings he tried to move on to actual experience, \"and it was on this experience that later on I founded my philosophy, not on ideas themselves.\u201d<ref>CWSA vol. 36, ''Autobiographical Writings'', p. 113</ref>\n\nHe assumes that the seers of the Upanishads had basically the same approach and gives some details of his vision of the past in a long passage in ''The Renaissance of India''. \"The Upanishads have been the acknowledged source of numerous profound philosophies and religions,\" he writes. Even [[Buddhism]] with all its developments was only a \"restatement\" from a new standpoint and with fresh terms. And, furthermore, the ideas of the Upanishads \"can be rediscovered in much of the thought of [[Pythagoras]] and Plato and form the profound part of [[Neo-platonism]] and [[Gnosticism]]...\" Finally, the larger part of German metaphysics \"is little more in substance than an intellectual development of great realities more spiritually seen in this ancient teaching.\"<ref>CWSA, vol. 20, p. 330</ref> When once he was asked by a disciple whether Plato got some of his ideas from Indian books, he responded that though something of the philosophy of India got through \"by means of Pythagoras and others\", he assumed that Plato got most of his ideas from intuition.<ref>CWSA vol. 27, ''Letters on Poetry and Art'', p. 520.</ref>\n\nSri Aurobindo's indebtedness to the Indian tradition also becomes obvious through his placing a large number of quotations from the [[Rig Veda]], the [[Upanishads]] and the [[Bhagavadgita]] at the beginning of the chapters in ''The Life Divine'', showing the connection of his own thought to [[Veda]] and [[Vedanta]].{{sfn|Huchzermeyer|2016|p=10}}{{sfnp|Heehs|2008|p=276}}\n\nThe ''Isha Upanishad'' is considered to be one of the most important and more accessible writings of Sri Aurobindo.{{sfnp|Heehs|2008|p=267}} Before he published his final translation and analysis, he wrote ten incomplete commentaries.<ref>CWSA vol. 17, Publisher\u2019s Note</ref>  In a key passage he points out that the Brahman or Absolute is both the Stable and the Moving. \"We must see it in eternal and immutable Spirit and in all the changing manifestations of universe and relativity.\"{{sfnp|Heehs|2008|p=267}}<ref>CWSA 17:30</ref>  Sri Aurobindo's biographer K.R.S. Iyengar quotes R.S. Mugali as stating that Sri Aurobindo might have obtained in this Upanishad the thought-seed which later grew into ''The Life Divine''.<ref>K. R. Srinivasa Iyengar (1972) ''Sri Aurobindo \u2013 A Biography and a history.'' Pondicherry, Sri Aurobindo Ashram. p. 441.</ref>\n\n=== Synthesis and integration ===\n[[Sisir Kumar Maitra]], who was a leading exponent of Sri Aurobindo's Philosophy,{{sfn|Huchzermeyer|2016|p=85}}  has referred to the issue of external influences and written that Sri Aurobindo does not mention names, but \"as one reads his books one cannot fail to notice how thorough is his grasp of the great Western philosophers of the present age...\" Although he is Indian one should not \"underrate the influence of Western thought upon him. This influence is there, very clearly visible, but Sri Aurobindo... has not allowed himself to be dominated by it. He has made full use of Western thought, but he has made use of it for the purpose of building up his own system...\"<ref>Maitra, S.K. (1988): ''The Meeting of the East and the West in Sri Aurobindo\u2019s Philosophy.'' Pondicherry, Sri Aurobindo Ashram. p. 49. {{ISBN|978-8170580782}}</ref> Thus Maitra, like Steve Odin,{{sfn|Huchzermeyer|2016|p=78}} sees Sri Aurobindo not only in the tradition and context of Indian, but also Western philosophy and assumes he may have adopted some elements from the latter for his synthesis.\n\nR. Puligandla supports this viewpoint in his book ''Fundamentals of Indian Philosophy''. He describes Sri Aurobindo's philosophy as \"an original synthesis of the Indian and Western traditions.\" \"He integrates in a unique fashion the great social, political and scientific achievements of the modern West with the ancient and profound spiritual insights of [[Hinduism]]. The vision that powers the life divine of Aurobindo is none other than the Upanishadic vision of the unity of all existence.\"<ref name=Puligandla>{{cite book|author=Ramakrishna Puligandla|title=Fundamentals of Indian Philosophy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LJ_0OAAACAAJ|year=1997|publisher=D.K. Printworld|isbn=978-81-246-0087-0|pages=267\u2013268}}</ref>\n\nPuligandla believes that the Western influence also becomes evident through Sri Aurobindo's critical position vis-\u00e0-vis [[Adi Shankara|Shankara]]<ref>For Sri Aurobindo\u2019s critique, see, for instance, CWSA vol. 17, ''Isha Upanishad'', pp. 498\u201399. There he says that Shankara\u2019s world-negative approach \"has overshadowed for centuries the lives and souls of hundreds of millions of human beings.\" However, he also recognized him as \"one of the mightiest of metaphysical intellects.\" (''Isha Upanishad'', p. 497)</ref> and his assumption that the latter teaches through his Mayavada or Illusionism that the world is unreal and illusory. Puligandla objects, \"nowhere does Shankara say that the world is unreal and illusory. Quite the contrary, through the concept of sublation he teaches that the world is neither real nor unreal. That this is indeed his teaching is further borne out by his distinction between lower and higher truths.\" Therefore, Puligandla concludes that \"Aurobindo's characterization of Shankara's Vedanta as a world-negating philosophy is unfounded.\" He believes that Sri Aurobindo in his endeavour to synthesize Hindu and Western modes of thought has wrongly identified Shankara's Mayavada with the subjective idealism of [[George Berkeley]], \"which undoubtedly stands in sharp contrast to the realism of the Western philosophical tradition in general.\" Nonetheless, Puligandla believes that Sri Aurobindo was \"a great philosopher-mystic\" with a significant vision of man and the world.<ref name=Puligandla/>\n\nSri Aurobindo's critique of Shankara is supported by U. C. Dubey in his paper titled ''Integralism: The Distinctive Feature of Sri Aurobindo\u2019s Philosophy.'' He starts by summarizing what he considers to be Sri Aurobindo's most important contributions to philosophy and mentions at first his integral view of Reality. \"The creative force or 'cit-\u015bakti' is regarded by him as one with the Absolute. Thus there is no opposition between the Absolute and its creative force in his system.\" Next Dubey refers to Sri Aurobindo's  conception of the [[supermind (Integral yoga)|supermind]] as the mediatory principle between the Absolute and the finite world and quotes S.K. Maitra stating that this conception \"is the pivot round which the whole of Sri Aurobindo\u2019s philosophy moves.\"<ref name=Dubey>U. C. Dubey (2007) \"Integralism the distinctive feature of Sri Aurobindo's philosophy\", pp. 25\u201327, Ch. 2 in ''Understanding Thoughts of Sri Aurobindo''. Indrani Sanyal and Krishna Roy (eds.). D K Printworld. New Delhi. {{ISBN|9788124604021}}</ref>\n\nDubey proceeds to analyse the approach of the Shankarites and believes that they follow an inadequate kind of logic that does not do justice to the challenge of tackling the problem of the Absolute, which cannot be known by finite reason. With the help of the finite reason, he says, \"we are bound to determine the nature of reality as one or many, being or becoming. But Sri Aurobindo's Integral Advaitism reconciles all apparently different aspects of Existence in an all-embracing unity of the Absolute.\"  Next, Dubey explains that for Sri Aurobindo there is a higher reason, the \"logic of the infinite\" in which his integralism is rooted, and expounds this concept by presenting some quotations from ''The Life Divine''. In concluding he notes critically \"that Sri Aurobindo does not explain sufficiently the nature of the logic of the infinite.\" Nevertheless, \"the way he proposes this logic is undoubtedly his unique contribution in the field of Absolutism.\"<ref name=Dubey/>\n\n== Legacy ==\n[[File:Sri Aurobindo 1964 stamp of India.jpg|thumb|Sri Aurobindo on a 1964 stamp of India]]\nSri Aurobindo was an [[Indian nationalist movement|Indian nationalist]] but is best known for his philosophy on human evolution and Integral Yoga.{{sfnp|McDermott|1994|p=11|ps=}}\n\n=== Influence ===\nHis influence has been wide-ranging.
