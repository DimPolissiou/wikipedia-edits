Bartlett was named in ''[[Wheels magazine|Wheels]]'' magazine's annual yearbook in 2004 as one of Australia's 50 greatest race drivers.  He placed #15 on the list.\n\n==Racing career==\nBartlett first arrived on the Australian racing scene in 1958 when he competed in the Touring Car Scratch Race at [[Mount Panorama Circuit|Bathurst]], driving a 950cc [[Morris Minor]].\n\nOver the next few years, Bartlett progressed through the levels of Australian motorsport before his big break came when he was hired to drive for 1960 [[Australian Grand Prix]] winner [[Alec Mildren]] in the [[Tasman Series]] of open wheel racing. Bartlett proved competitive in this series and would become a fixture of Alec Mildren Racing for the next decade racing a long line of open-wheel racing cars and Alfa Romeo touring cars. Bartlett won the [[1965 International 6 Hour Touring Car Race]] for the Mildren team, driving an [[Alfa Romeo TI Super]] with [[Frank Gardner (racing driver)|Frank Gardner]] and he also won the [[1967 Surfers Paradise Four Hour]], driving a similar car with [[Doug Chivas]].\n\nBartlett got his first works drive via motoring journalist and part time rally driver [[Evan Green (journalist)|Evan Green]] at [[Mount Panorama Circuit|Bathurst]] driving a [[Mini|Morris Mini de Luxe]] for the [[British Motor Corporation (Australia)|BMC]] team in the [[1965 Armstrong 500]].<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Wl1vvNFn3k 1990 \"Privateers the Underdogs of Motor Racing\" - Bartlett Forbes]</ref>\n\nAt the 1967 Bathurst Easter meeting, Bartlett became the first driver to ever lap the 6.172&nbsp;km mountain circuit at an average speed of over 100&nbsp;mph driving a [[Brabham|1964 Repco Brabham BT11A]] Climax.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://racingheritage.com.au/viewtopic.php?f=7&t=23 |title=1964 BT11A Repco Brabham Climax |access-date=12 October 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120321131610/http://www.racingheritage.com.au/viewtopic.php?f=7&t=23 |archive-date=21 March 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nIn 1970, Bartlett traveled to the United States to compete in the USAC Championship (aka Indy Car) series,<ref>{{cite news|title=Bartlett Needs Spot To Avoid Long Trip|work=The Free Lance\u2013Star|agency=Associated Press|date=22 May 1970|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=wQURAAAAIBAJ&sjid=jOcDAAAAIBAJ&pg=6132,2415209|accessdate=14 May 2010}}</ref> attempting and failing to qualify for the [[1970 Indianapolis 500|Indianapolis 500]].<ref>{{cite news|title=McElreath Joins Indianapolis 500 Lineup|work=The Palm Beach Post|agency=Associated Press|date=25 May 1970|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=jn0yAAAAIBAJ&sjid=-bUFAAAAIBAJ&pg=4286,4134226|accessdate=14 May 2010}}</ref> Bartlett competed in three other Indy Car races, but failed to finish.\n\nBartlett was signed on to co-drive with [[John Goss (race driver)|John Goss]] in the [[1973 Bathurst 1000]], in a brand-new [[Ford XA Falcon]] GT Hardtop.  They qualified on pole position for the race and led for over three-and-a-half hours, but crashed out of the race on lap 110.  They returned the following [[1974 Hardie-Ferodo 1000|year]] and won the event with Bartlett holding off the Bob Forbes [[Holden Torana|Torana]] and bringing the Goss Falcon home in the rain.<ref>{{cite news|last=de Fraga|first=Chris|title=Bartlett and Goss\u2014out of the pack|work=The Age|date=8 October 1974|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=CVUQAAAAIBAJ&sjid=M5IDAAAAIBAJ&pg=7002,1519676|accessdate=14 May 2010}}</ref> Bartlett's Bathurst-winning drive in 1974 was achieved while he still carried hip and pelvis injuries from a major crash at the [[Pukekohe Park Raceway|Pukekohe]] round of the Tasman Series nine months earlier.\n\nBartlett was a fixture of [[Formula 5000]] throughout the 70s with a series of [[Lola Cars|Lola]]s and briefly the unique Brabham BT43 Formula 5000. As the decade closed and [[Formula 5000]] declined, Bartlett returned to touring cars, developing the American [[Chevrolet Camaro (second generation)|Chevrolet Camaro Z28]] for Australian [[Group C (Australia)|Group C]] with the partnership of [[Kerry Packer]]'s television network the [[Nine Network]]. The car (which Bartlett had purchased new from [[Al Unser|Unser Chevrolet]] in [[New Mexico]]<ref>[http://www.streetmachine.com.au/features/1504/gallery-kevin-barlett-talks-about-his-channel-nine-camaro Kevin Bartlett talks about his Channel Nine Chevrolet Camaro]</ref>) debuted, without Bartlett, at the [[1979 Bathurst 1000]]. Bartlett was to co-drive with Bob Forbes in the James Hardie 1000, but a bad F5000 crash in the Brabham BT43 at the Sandown Gold Star Round on September 9, 1979 saw KB watch the race from a wheelchair nursing a broken arm and leg with F5000 and [[Group B Sports Sedans|Sports Sedan]] racer [[John McCormack (racing driver)|John McCormack]] taking his place in the car.\n\nKB was back in 1980 and was the only driver to seriously challenge the [[Marlboro Holden Dealer Team]] [[Holden VB Commodore|Commodore]] of [[Peter Brock]] in the [[1980 Australian Touring Car Championship]]. Bartlett would go on to take pole position for the [[1980 Hardie-Ferodo 1000]] at Bathurst in the Camaro but his race was soured by the car being forced to run drum brakes on the rear with his first stop to change the rear drums coming after only 14 laps (guest [[Seven Network|Channel 7]] pit reporter [[Chris Economaki]] reported that the drums were so hot when they came off the car that they literally blistered the paint on the inside pit wall). Later in the race Bartlett tangled with a baby car class [[Isuzu Gemini]] on top of The Mountain simply because he had run out of brakes and couldn't stop in time. The Gemini rolled and after coming into the pits Bartlett told a national television audience that he was sorry for the incident but that the blame lay squarely with [[Confederation of Australian Motorsport|CAMS]] regulations not allowing the Camaro's to run 4-wheel disc brakes. In the interview he told Channel 7's [[Evan Green (journalist)|Evan Green]] ''\"And of course with our stupid bloody CAMS rules not allowing us to have disc brakes in the back this thing just doesn't stop, its bloody dangerous out there without discs. And I just hit him, and just rolled him. You know sure he made a mistake, but in a normal situation I should have been able to slow up enough. This car doesn't stop, it slows up. That's the difference\"''.<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Turi5VV6uYo Bathurst 1980 - Kevin Bartlett Chevrolet Camaro Interview]</ref>\n\nBartlett only contested two rounds of the [[1981 Australian Touring Car Championship]] in the Camaro, which by now was allowed to run 4 wheel disc brakes making it a much safer and much more formidable challenger. He then chose not to race in the [[1981 Hang Ten 400]] at Sandown, but still went to Bathurst as one of the favourites. He claimed his second pole in a row on The Mountain in frightfully wet conditions, recording a time that was 15.46 seconds slower than he had been 12 months earlier. After a good start where he was dicing with Brock's [[Holden VC Commodore|Holden Commodore]] and the [[Ford XD Falcon|Ford Falcon]]'s of [[Dick Johnson (racing driver)|Dick Johnson]] and [[Bob Morris (racing driver)|Bob Morris]] (who would eventually finish 1st and 2nd respectively), a number of small problems, including a crash with the Commodore of Ron Wanless saw the Camaro finally finish 13th, 11 laps down on Johnson. The crash with Wanless prompted a fired up KB to tell [[ATN|Channel 7]] that ''\"A complete and utter amateur nincumpoop got in the way\"'' and that he was ''\"Going to punch him in the mouth when the race was over\"'', though he later told that he thankfully didn't go through with it after finding out that Wanless was also a semi-professional boxer.\n\nThe Camaro was coming towards the end of its development in 1982. He finished equal third on points with [[Allan Moffat]] in the [[1982 Australian Touring Car Championship]], winning his final ATCC race at Sydney's Oran Park in Round 4. He then enlisted the services of [[Colin Bond]] to be his co-driver in the [[1982 Australian Endurance Championship|Australian Endurance Championship]]. Bond drove the Camaro in the 250&nbsp;km Perrier Gold Cup at Oran Park where the car was competitive but suffered tyre problems. They then went to the [[1982 James Hardie 1000|James Hardie 1000]] at Bathurst as a strong contender for their third straight pole position, but suffered a set back in qualifying when a tyre blew on top of The Mountain, sending bond into the guardrail. Despite this Bartlett qualified the car in 4th place. KB then had an early race duel for third place with the [[Ford XE Falcon|Falcon]] of Dick Johnson and the second Dealer Team [[Holden VH Commodore|Commodore]] of [[John Harvey (racing driver)|John Harvey]] which went on for a number of laps. Bartlett's race ended on lap 27 when the Camaro blew its left rear tyre at Reid Park, sending him into the fence and causing the car to roll onto its roof and slide across the track with a close following Johnson only just missing him.\n\nKevin Bartlett's final race in the Camaro came in the Oran Park round of the [[1983 Australian Touring Car Championship|1983 ATCC]], though by this time he was not competitive and he only recorded a 9th-place finish. He then went on to be Dick Johnson's co-driver in the [[1983 James Hardie 1000]], though the race weekend was a disaster for the [[Dick Johnson Racing|team]] after Johnson's Hardie's Heroes crash at Forrest's Elbow destroyed the Greens-Tuf Falcon. A car swapping deal was then done and the team had another Falcon ready to run for the race, but the hastily built Ford was well off the pace and was eventually retired on lap 61.\n\nBartlett's autobiography entitled \"Big Rev Kev\" was published in 1983.\n\nIn 1984, Bartlett headed Mitsubishi's first factory backed attack on the Bathurst 1000 with the [[Mitsubishi Starion]] turbo running in the new [[Group A]] class that would become uniform in 1985. Unfortunately Bathurst would prove problematic for the team with the cars being forced to run components that weren't compatible with the engine's electronics and the car was uncompetitive. Bartlett then led Mitsubishi's first assault on the Australian Touring Car Championship in [[1985 Australian Touring Car Championship|1985]], finishing in a fine 3rd place in the opening round at [[Winton Motor Raceway|Winton]], but ultimately dropping to 9th in the series as the established teams got their Group A cars up to speed. He and motoring journalist Peter McKay then went on to finish 9th outright and second in class in the [[1985 James Hardie 1000]] at Bathurst.\n\nDuring 1985, Bartlett also drove a [[Ground effect (aerodynamics)|ground effects]] [[De Tomaso Pantera]] designed and built by ex-[[Formula One]] mechanic and [[Kaditcha]] racing cars owner Barry Lock to finish 4th in the [[1985 Australian GT Championship season|1985 Australian GT Championship]]. Bartlett only drove in the opening round of the [[1986 Australian Touring Car Championship|1986 ATCC]] at Amaroo Park in a privately entered Starion (though he would not complete enough laps to be classified as a finisher), and would join the Frank Gardner run [[JPS Team BMW]] as a co-driver in the team's second [[BMW E24|BMW 635 CSi]] for the [[1986 Castrol 500|Sandown 500]] and the [[1986 James Hardie 1000|James Hardie 1000]] where he would co-drive with New Zealander Trevor Crowe. Unfortunately the BMW was a non finisher in both races.\n\nIn 1987, Bartlett drove a [[Maserati Biturbo]] for [[World Touring Car Championship]] team Pro Team Italia on their visit to Australia and New Zealand. While the Maserati was, on paper, a strong contender, in reality the car was under developed and well off the pace and although driving with 1985 Bathurst winner [[Armin Hahne]] and ex-Formula One driver [[Bruno Giacomelli]] (who failed to qualify at [[1987 James Hardie 1000|Bathurst]]), the car only lasted 29 laps of the race.\n\n1988 saw Bartlett team with longtime rival John Harvey in a Bob Forbes owned [[Holden VL Commodore SS Group A SV]] in the [[1988 Tooheys 1000|Tooheys 1000]] at Bathurst. After the new car had some teething problems in practice, they would start 22nd on the grid. The car initially raced faster than it qualified and Harvey (who started) was soon into the top 10 and battling with the [[E30 M3|BMW M3]] of [[Peter Brock]], but was forced to pit after 20 laps with a clutch problem. Ultimately they would finish in 14th place, 21 laps down on the winners.\n\nAfter missing the [[1989 Tooheys 1000]], Bartlett's final drive in racing was the [[1990 Tooheys 1000]], sharing a Holden Commodore with [[Russell Ingall]] and open wheel star [[Rohan Onslow]], again in a car owned by the man he beat to win the 1974 Bathurst 1000, Bob Forbes.\n\nAccording to Bartlett, the 1990 Tooheys 1000 nearly killed him. The night before the race the team had bled the car's water system and unfortunately left the heater tap on which was not discovered until after the race. The result was that both Bartlett and Ingall suffered from dehydration with Bartlett collapsing in the pits and being placed on a drip after his driving stint (making matters worse was during his stint Bartlett knocked his water bottle over and had nothing to drink). Onslow, who was cross entered in the car and was the co-driver of the team's lead Commodore with [[Mark Gibbs (racing driver)|Mark Gibbs]], was forced to finish the race in the #13 car as neither Bartlett nor Ingall could do so. A couple of months after the race, Bartlett suffered a [[Myocardial infarction|heart attack]] which required a quadruple bypass, effectively ending his 32 year racing career. His specialists put his heart attack down to the trauma he suffered during the race.<ref>[http://www.streetmachine.com.au/features/1603/kevin-bartletts-1974-bathurst-win-in-falcon-xa-gt-coupe/ Kevin Bartlett talks his 1974 Bathurst win and more]</ref>\n\n==Retirement==\nIn his retirement Bartlett works part-time to maintain the famous Bowden collection of historic racing cars, which includes Bartlett's Chevrolet Camaro.\n\nOn 24 October 2000, Bartlett was awarded the [[Australian Sports Medal]] for his motor racing achievements.<ref>{{cite web|title=Kevin Bartlett|url=http://www.itsanhonour.gov.au/honours/honour_roll/search.cfm?aus_award_id=979085&search_type=advanced&showInd=true|publisher=[[Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet (Australia)|Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet]]|accessdate=17 February 2012}}</ref>\n\n==Career results==\n[[File:Bartlett-T300-Graham-Rucker.jpg|thumb|Bartlett placed 2nd in the 1972 Australian Drivers' Championship driving a Lola T300]]\n[[File:Falcongoss.jpg|thumb|John Goss's reproduction of the [[1974 Bathurst 1000]] winning Falcon]]\n[[File:Bartlett-camaro.jpg|thumb|Bartlett's Chevrolet Camaro]]\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 95%;\"\n|-\n!

Bartlett was named in ''[[Wheels magazine|Wheels]]'' magazine's annual yearbook in 2004 as one of Australia's 50 greatest race drivers.  He placed #15 on the list.\n\n==Racing career==\nBartlett first arrived on the Australian racing scene in 1958 when he competed in the Touring Car Scratch Race at [[Mount Panorama Circuit|Bathurst]], driving a 950cc [[Morris Minor]].\n\nOver the next few years, Bartlett progressed through the levels of Australian motorsport before his big break came when he was hired to drive for 1960 [[Australian Grand Prix]] winner [[Alec Mildren]] in the [[Tasman Series]] of open wheel racing. Bartlett proved competitive in this series and would become a fixture of Alec Mildren Racing for the next decade racing a long line of open-wheel racing cars and Alfa Romeo touring cars. Bartlett won the [[1965 International 6 Hour Touring Car Race]] for the Mildren team, driving an [[Alfa Romeo TI Super]] with [[Frank Gardner (racing driver)|Frank Gardner]] and he also won the [[1967 Surfers Paradise Four Hour]], driving a similar car with [[Doug Chivas]].\n\nBartlett got his first works drive via motoring journalist and part time rally driver [[Evan Green (journalist)|Evan Green]] at [[Mount Panorama Circuit|Bathurst]] driving a [[Mini|Morris Mini de Luxe]] for the [[British Motor Corporation (Australia)|BMC]] team in the [[1965 Armstrong 500]].<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Wl1vvNFn3k 1990 \"Privateers the Underdogs of Motor Racing\" - Bartlett Forbes]</ref>\n\nAt the 1967 Bathurst Easter meeting, Bartlett became the first driver to ever lap the 6.172&nbsp;km mountain circuit at an average speed of over 100&nbsp;mph driving a [[Brabham|1964 Repco Brabham BT11A]] Climax.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://racingheritage.com.au/viewtopic.php?f=7&t=23 |title=1964 BT11A Repco Brabham Climax |access-date=12 October 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120321131610/http://www.racingheritage.com.au/viewtopic.php?f=7&t=23 |archive-date=21 March 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nIn 1970, Bartlett traveled to the United States to compete in the USAC Championship (aka Indy Car) series,<ref>{{cite news|title=Bartlett Needs Spot To Avoid Long Trip|work=The Free Lance\u2013Star|agency=Associated Press|date=22 May 1970|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=wQURAAAAIBAJ&sjid=jOcDAAAAIBAJ&pg=6132,2415209|accessdate=14 May 2010}}</ref> attempting and failing to qualify for the [[1970 Indianapolis 500|Indianapolis 500]].<ref>{{cite news|title=McElreath Joins Indianapolis 500 Lineup|work=The Palm Beach Post|agency=Associated Press|date=25 May 1970|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=jn0yAAAAIBAJ&sjid=-bUFAAAAIBAJ&pg=4286,4134226|accessdate=14 May 2010}}</ref> Bartlett competed in three other Indy Car races, but failed to finish.\n\nBartlett was signed on to co-drive with [[John Goss (race driver)|John Goss]] in the [[1973 Bathurst 1000]], in a brand-new [[Ford XA Falcon]] GT Hardtop.  They qualified on pole position for the race and led for over three-and-a-half hours, but crashed out of the race on lap 110.  They returned the following [[1974 Hardie-Ferodo 1000|year]] and won the event with Bartlett holding off the Bob Forbes [[Holden Torana|Torana]] and bringing the Goss Falcon home in the rain.<ref>{{cite news|last=de Fraga|first=Chris|title=Bartlett and Goss\u2014out of the pack|work=The Age|date=8 October 1974|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=CVUQAAAAIBAJ&sjid=M5IDAAAAIBAJ&pg=7002,1519676|accessdate=14 May 2010}}</ref> Bartlett's Bathurst-winning drive in 1974 was achieved while he still carried hip and pelvis injuries from a major crash at the [[Pukekohe Park Raceway|Pukekohe]] round of the Tasman Series nine months earlier.\n\nBartlett was a fixture of [[Formula 5000]] throughout the 70s with a series of [[Lola Cars|Lola]]s and briefly the unique Brabham BT43 Formula 5000. As the decade closed and [[Formula 5000]] declined, Bartlett returned to touring cars, developing the American [[Chevrolet Camaro (second generation)|Chevrolet Camaro Z28]] for Australian [[Group C (Australia)|Group C]] with the partnership of [[Kerry Packer]]'s television network the [[Nine Network]]. The car (which Bartlett had purchased new from [[Al Unser|Unser Chevrolet]] in [[New Mexico]]<ref>[http://www.streetmachine.com.au/features/1504/gallery-kevin-barlett-talks-about-his-channel-nine-camaro Kevin Bartlett talks about his Channel Nine Chevrolet Camaro]</ref>) debuted, without Bartlett, at the [[1979 Bathurst 1000]]. Bartlett was to co-drive with Bob Forbes in the James Hardie 1000, but a bad F5000 crash in the Brabham BT43 at the Sandown Gold Star Round on September 9, 1979 saw KB watch the race from a wheelchair nursing a broken arm and leg with F5000 and [[Group B Sports Sedans|Sports Sedan]] racer [[John McCormack (racing driver)|John McCormack]] taking his place in the car.\n\nKB was back in 1980 and was the only driver to seriously challenge the [[Marlboro Holden Dealer Team]] [[Holden VB Commodore|Commodore]] of [[Peter Brock]] in the [[1980 Australian Touring Car Championship]]. Bartlett would go on to take pole position for the [[1980 Hardie-Ferodo 1000]] at Bathurst in the Camaro but his race was soured by the car being forced to run drum brakes on the rear with his first stop to change the rear drums coming after only 14 laps (guest [[Seven Network|Channel 7]] pit reporter [[Chris Economaki]] reported that the drums were so hot when they came off the car that they literally blistered the paint on the inside pit wall). Later in the race Bartlett tangled with a baby car class [[Isuzu Gemini]] on top of The Mountain simply because he had run out of brakes and couldn't stop in time. The Gemini rolled and after coming into the pits Bartlett told a national television audience that he was sorry for the incident but that the blame lay squarely with [[Confederation of Australian Motorsport|CAMS]] regulations not allowing the Camaro's to run 4-wheel disc brakes. In the interview he told Channel 7's [[Evan Green (journalist)|Evan Green]] ''\"And of course with our stupid bloody CAMS rules not allowing us to have disc brakes in the back this thing just doesn't stop, its bloody dangerous out there without discs. And I just hit him, and just rolled him. You know sure he made a mistake, but in a normal situation I should have been able to slow up enough. This car doesn't stop, it slows up. That's the difference\"''.<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Turi5VV6uYo Bathurst 1980 - Kevin Bartlett Chevrolet Camaro Interview]</ref>\n\nBartlett only contested two rounds of the [[1981 Australian Touring Car Championship]] in the Camaro, which by now was allowed to run 4 wheel disc brakes making it a much safer and much more formidable challenger. He then chose not to race in the [[1981 Hang Ten 400]] at Sandown, but still went to Bathurst as one of the favourites. He claimed his second pole in a row on The Mountain in frightfully wet conditions, recording a time that was 15.46 seconds slower than he had been 12 months earlier. After a good start where he was dicing with Brock's [[Holden VC Commodore|Holden Commodore]] and the [[Ford XD Falcon|Ford Falcon]]'s of [[Dick Johnson (racing driver)|Dick Johnson]] and [[Bob Morris (racing driver)|Bob Morris]] (who would eventually finish 1st and 2nd respectively), a number of small problems, including a crash with the Commodore of Ron Wanless saw the Camaro finally finish 13th, 11 laps down on Johnson. The crash with Wanless prompted a fired up KB to tell [[ATN|Channel 7]] that ''\"A complete and utter amateur nincumpoop got in the way\"'' and that he was ''\"Going to punch him in the mouth when the race was over\"'', though he later told that he thankfully didn't go through with it after finding out that Wanless was also a semi-professional boxer.\n\nThe Camaro was coming towards the end of its development in 1982. He finished equal third on points with [[Allan Moffat]] in the [[1982 Australian Touring Car Championship]], winning his final ATCC race at Sydney's Oran Park in Round 4. He then enlisted the services of [[Colin Bond]] to be his co-driver in the [[1982 Australian Endurance Championship|Australian Endurance Championship]]. Bond drove the Camaro in the 250&nbsp;km Perrier Gold Cup at Oran Park where the car was competitive but suffered tyre problems. They then went to the [[1982 James Hardie 1000|James Hardie 1000]] at Bathurst as a strong contender for their third straight pole position, but suffered a set back in qualifying when a tyre blew on top of The Mountain, sending bond into the guardrail. Despite this Bartlett qualified the car in 4th place. KB then had an early race duel for third place with the [[Ford XE Falcon|Falcon]] of Dick Johnson and the second Dealer Team [[Holden VH Commodore|Commodore]] of [[John Harvey (racing driver)|John Harvey]] which went on for a number of laps. Bartlett's race ended on lap 27 when the Camaro blew its left rear tyre at Reid Park, sending him into the fence and causing the car to roll onto its roof and slide across the track with a close following Johnson only just missing him.\n\nKevin Bartlett's final race in the Camaro came in the Oran Park round of the [[1983 Australian Touring Car Championship|1983 ATCC]], though by this time he was not competitive and he only recorded a 9th-place finish. He then went on to be Dick Johnson's co-driver in the [[1983 James Hardie 1000]], though the race weekend was a disaster for the [[Dick Johnson Racing|team]] after Johnson's Hardie's Heroes crash at Forrest's Elbow destroyed the Greens-Tuf Falcon. A car swapping deal was then done and the team had another Falcon ready to run for the race, but the hastily built Ford was well off the pace and was eventually retired on lap 61.\n\nBartlett's autobiography entitled \"Big Rev Kev\" was published in 1983.\n\nIn 1984, Bartlett headed Mitsubishi's first factory backed attack on the Bathurst 1000 with the [[Mitsubishi Starion]] turbo running in the new [[Group A]] class that would become uniform in 1985. Unfortunately Bathurst would prove problematic for the team with the cars being forced to run components that weren't compatible with the engine's electronics and the car was uncompetitive. Bartlett then led Mitsubishi's first assault on the Australian Touring Car Championship in [[1985 Australian Touring Car Championship|1985]], finishing in a fine 3rd place in the opening round at [[Winton Motor Raceway|Winton]], but ultimately dropping to 9th in the series as the established teams got their Group A cars up to speed. He and motoring journalist Peter McKay then went on to finish 9th outright and second in class in the [[1985 James Hardie 1000]] at Bathurst.\n\nDuring 1985, Bartlett also drove a [[Ground effect (aerodynamics)|ground effects]] [[De Tomaso Pantera]] designed and built by ex-[[Formula One]] mechanic and [[Kaditcha]] racing cars owner Barry Lock to finish 4th in the [[1985 Australian GT Championship season|1985 Australian GT Championship]]. Bartlett only drove in the opening round of the [[1986 Australian Touring Car Championship|1986 ATCC]] at Amaroo Park in a privately entered Starion (though he would not complete enough laps to be classified as a finisher), and would join the Frank Gardner run [[JPS Team BMW]] as a co-driver in the teams second [[BMW E24|BMW 635 CSi]] for the [[1986 Castrol 500|Sandown 500]] and the [[1986 James Hardie 1000|James Hardie 1000]] where he would co-drive with New Zealander Trevor Crowe. Unfortunately the BMW was a non finisher in both races.\n\nIn 1987, Bartlett drove a [[Maserati Biturbo]] for [[World Touring Car Championship]] team Pro Team Italia on their visit to Australia and New Zealand. While the Maserati was, on paper, a strong contender, in reality the car was under developed and well off the pace and although driving with 1985 Bathurst winner [[Armin Hahne]] and ex-Formula One driver [[Bruno Giacomelli]] (who failed to qualify at [[1987 James Hardie 1000|Bathurst]]), the car only lasted 29 laps of the race.\n\n1988 saw Bartlett team with longtime rival John Harvey in a Bob Forbes owned [[Holden VL Commodore SS Group A SV]] in the [[1988 Tooheys 1000|Tooheys 1000]] at Bathurst. After the new car had some teething problems in practice, they would start 22nd on the grid. The car initially raced faster than it qualified and Harvey (who started) was soon into the top 10 and battling with the [[E30 M3|BMW M3]] of [[Peter Brock]], but was forced to pit after 20 laps with a clutch problem. Ultimately they would finish in 14th place, 21 laps down on the winners.\n\nAfter missing the [[1989 Tooheys 1000]], Bartlett's final drive in racing was the [[1990 Tooheys 1000]], sharing a Holden Commodore with [[Russell Ingall]] and open wheel star [[Rohan Onslow]], again in a car owned by the man he beat to win the 1974 Bathurst 1000, Bob Forbes.\n\nAccording to Bartlett, the 1990 Tooheys 1000 nearly killed him. The night before the race the team had bled the cars water system and unfortunately left the heater tap on which was not discovered until after the race. The result was that both Bartlett and Ingall suffered from dehydration with Bartlett collapsing in the pits and being placed on a drip after his driving stint (making matters worse was during his stint Bartlett knocked his water bottle over and had nothing to drink). Onslow, who was cross entered in the car and was the co-driver of the teams lead Commodore with [[Mark Gibbs (racing driver)|Mark Gibbs]], was forced to finish the race in the #13 car as neither Bartlett nor Ingall could do so. A couple of months after the race, Bartlett suffered a [[Myocardial infarction|heart attack]] which required a quadruple bypass, effectively ending his 32 year racing career.

It was filmed on location at [[Greenwich]] and the ''EastEnders'' [[Albert Square]] set, situated at [[Elstree Studios]] in [[Borehamwood]], [[Hertfordshire]]. It features several of the ''EastEnders'' stars of the time. Produced for the ''[[Children in Need]]'' charity, following ''Doctor Who'''s hiatus in 1989 this special was the only dramatisation broadcast in celebration of the show's 30th anniversary.\n\nThe special over the years has been panned by the ''Doctor Who Fanbase'' and is no longer considered to be canon in the main continuity.\n\n==Plot==\n\nThe [[Rani (Doctor Who)|Rani]] has opened a hole in time, allowing her access to the Doctor's timeline. She uses this to cycle through the Doctor's lives, causing him and his companions to jump back and forth between past and present incarnations. Her intention is to capture all of the Doctor's selves in a time loop, trapping him in London's [[East End of London|East End]]; she has already captured the [[First Doctor|First]] and [[Second Doctor]] in the time hole.  This causes the [[Fourth Doctor]] to send a message to his remaining selves, warning them of the Rani's plan:\n\n{{quote|Mayday! Mayday! This is an urgent message for all of the Doctors. It's vitally important that you listen carefully to me, for once. Our whole existence is being threatened by a renegade Time Lord known only as the Rani! She hates me. She even hates children! Two of my earlier selves have already been snared in her vicious trap. The grumpy one and the flautist, do you remember? She wants to put us out of action, lock us away in a dreary backwater of London's East End, trapped in a time-loop in perpetuity. Her evil is all around us! I can hear the heart beat of a killer. She's out there somewhere. We must be on our guard and we must stop her before she destroys all of my other selves! Oh... Good luck, my dears!|sign=|source=}}\n\nThe [[Seventh Doctor]] and [[Ace (Doctor Who)|Ace]] are confused when the [[TARDIS]] lands in [[Greenwich]], near the [[Cutty Sark]], thanks to the Rani's attack on the TARDIS. The Doctor finds a newspaper showing the year to be 1973, but before he can make any more conclusions, the Rani causes time to jump. Ace finds herself in [[Albert Square]] in 1993 with the [[Sixth Doctor]]. Local resident [[Sanjay Kapoor (EastEnders)|Sanjay]] tries to sell Ace some new clothes from his stall, and when his wife [[Gita Kapoor|Gita]] tells the Sixth Doctor that it is going to be all the rage in 1994, the Rani jumps time again.\n\nThe [[Third Doctor]] and [[Mel Bush]] appear from the time jump, and question an old [[Pauline Fowler]] and [[Kathy Beale]] on when they are. When Pauline and Kathy reply that it is 2013, another time jump occurs. In 1973, Pauline and Kathy remember the assassination of [[John F. Kennedy|President Kennedy]], while Kathy tells off a young [[Ian Beale]]. The Sixth Doctor and [[Susan Foreman]] appear, but she wonders what has happened to 'her' Doctor, the First.\n\nAfter another time jump to 2013, Susan changes into [[Sarah Jane Smith]] and the Doctor changes from the Sixth to the Third Doctor. They start to piece together what is happening to them, but the Rani lets loose her menagerie of specimens, including a [[Cyberman]], Fifi (from ''[[The Happiness Patrol]]''), a [[Sea Devil (Doctor Who)|Sea Devil]], an [[Ogron]] and a [[Time Lord]] from [[Gallifrey]] in the next time jump. In 1993, the [[Fifth Doctor]], [[Nyssa (Doctor Who)|Nyssa]] and [[Perpugilliam Brown|Peri]] are attacked by the Rani's menagerie, and after they tried to warn [[Pat Butcher]] of the danger, the Rani stops them outside the [[Queen Vic]].\n\nIn 1993, after the Fifth Doctor changed to the Third Doctor in the next time jump, with [[Liz Shaw]], the Rani took control of Liz's mind. As [[Mandy Salter]] tries to stop the Rani, [[Mike Yates|Captain Mike Yates]] of [[UNIT]] comes in Bessie to save the Third Doctor and get him to [[Brigadier Lethbridge-Stewart|The Brigadier]] who is waiting for them.\n\nAfter another time jump, the Doctor changed to the [[Sixth Doctor]] and after he says goodbye to the Brigadier time jumps again.  In 1993, at the Arches, [[Phil Mitchell|Phil]] and [[Grant Mitchell (EastEnders)|Grant Mitchell]] find [[Romana (Doctor Who)|Romana]] looking for the Doctor, but they point her to [[Harold Legg|Dr. Harold Legg]]. As Romana walks past the [[Queen Vic]], the Rani captures her, in front of [[Frank Butcher]].\n\nBack in 1973, the Third Doctor explains to [[Victoria Waterfield]] who the Rani was and thinks that her control is breaking down, as they return to the TARDIS.\n\nAfter the Seventh Doctor lands the TARDIS in 1993, [[Leela (Doctor Who)|Leela]] escapes from the Rani, after being cloned in the form of Romana. This results in an additional [[Time Lord]] brain imprint being left on the computer inside the Rani's TARDIS instead of the human one she needed, which gives the Seventh Doctor, Ace, and [[K-9 (Doctor Who)|K9]] the edge needed to rig up a device to overload it, sending the Rani into the time tunnel where she had trapped the First and Second Doctors and freeing the Doctors' other selves from the loop. As the Seventh Doctor and Ace leave in the TARDIS, the Doctor observes \"Certainly, I \u2014 I mean, we \u2014 are difficult to get rid of.\"\n\n==Production==\n\n===Cast notes===\n*This was the final official appearance of [[Jon Pertwee]] as the [[Third Doctor]]; Pertwee died three years later. \n*[[Tom Baker]] returned to the role of the [[Fourth Doctor]] on television for the first time since leaving it 12 years previously, though he had recorded links for the video release of the incomplete \"[[Shada (Doctor Who)|Shada]]\" the year before. Baker was reluctant to take part as he hated the script and his scenes were re-written by himself at the last minute. [[Tom Baker]] would later return to the series in 2013's \"[[The Day of the Doctor]]\" in which he appears as ''\"The Curator\"'' who may or may not be a future incarnation of the Doctor himself. He will reprise the role in [[Big Finish Productions|Big Finish Productions']] ''\"Doctor Who: Stranded\"'', alongside [[Paul McGann]] as the [[Eighth Doctor]].\n*This special marks the first time that [[Peter Davison]] returned as the [[Fifth Doctor]], 9 years since he stepped down from the role after filming \"[[The Caves of Androzani]]\".

The script was entitled ''Destination: Holocaust'', and featured the Seventh Doctor and Brigadier holed up in a burning church, trying to fight off the advancing hordes of damaged Cybermen. This original idea, written by David Roden, was vetoed by Nathan-Turner after it became apparent that Children in Need wished for the story to be a tie-in with ''EastEnders''. Despite loving the originally proposed script, Nathan-Turner also had concerns about the cost, which would have included several lengthy night-shoots and a much larger special effects budget.\n* Allegedly, [[Anthony Ainley]] was approached by Nathan-Turner to play the part of the Master in this short story, but he turned it down. Ainley, however, vehemently denied this, insisting that if he were asked, he would have had no hesitation in appearing.  [[Michael Gough]] was later approached to re-create the role of the Celestial Toymaker, and again Nathan-Turner was turned down. Finally, Kate O'Mara was asked if she would like to reprise her role of the Rani \u2013 a request to which she readily agreed. O'Mara was joined by [[Samuel West]], who played her sidekick Cyrian (named after the original intended actor, Sir [[Ian McKellen]]).\n*The special was one of several special [[3D television|3D]] programmes the BBC produced at the time, using a 3D system developed by American inventor Terry D. Beard that made use of the [[Pulfrich effect]]. The technology required spectacles with one darkened lens and one transparent one; these were sold in shops to the public, with the proceeds going to Children in Need.\n*The [[Dalek]]s were also supposed to appear, but the segment was pulled after a dispute with Dalek creator [[Terry Nation]] over payments. The Dalek segment would have seen [[Peter Davison]] facing up against them again in the streets seen in the 1984 serial ''[[Resurrection of the Daleks]]''.\n*All actors and crew gave their services especially for Children in Need, and waived their fees on the condition that ''Dimensions in Time'' would never be repeated or sold on [[home video]] for profit. For the same reason, the story has and never will appear as an extra on a DVD release.\n*David Roden worked for the BBC Drama Department in London on the 'Writers Academy' training new writers. During 2007 and 2008 he worked for the BBC Wales Drama Department in Script Development alongside the production team for Season 4 of Russell T Davies' new ''Doctor Who''. He contributed a short story to the 'Doctor Who' novel 'The Story of Martha' (2008). Roden also wrote the ''Doctor Who'' BBC Audio Exclusive ''The Nemonite Invasion'' (2009), which was read by Catherine Tate.

It was filmed on location at [[Greenwich]] and the ''EastEnders'' [[Albert Square]] set, situated at [[Elstree Studios]] in [[Borehamwood]], [[Hertfordshire]]. It features several of the ''EastEnders'' stars of the time. Produced for the ''[[Children in Need]]'' charity, following ''Doctor Who'''s hiatus in 1989 this special was the only dramatisation broadcast in celebration of the show's 30th anniversary.\n\nThe special over the years has been panned by the ''Doctor Who Fanbase'' and is no longer considered to be canon in the main continuity.\n\n==Plot==\n\nThe [[Rani (Doctor Who)|Rani]] has opened a hole in time, allowing her access to the Doctor's timeline. She uses this to cycle through the Doctor's lives, causing him and his companions to jump back and forth between past and present incarnations. Her intention is to capture all of the Doctor's selves in a time loop, trapping him in London's [[East End of London|East End]]; she has already captured the [[First Doctor|First]] and [[Second Doctor]] in the time hole.  This causes the [[Fourth Doctor]] to send a message to his remaining selves, warning them of the Rani's plan:\n\n{{quote|Mayday! Mayday! This is an urgent message for all of the Doctors. It's vitally important that you listen carefully to me, for once. Our whole existence is being threatened by a renegade Time Lord known only as the Rani! She hates me. She even hates children! Two of my earlier selves have already been snared in her vicious trap. The grumpy one and the flautist, do you remember? She wants to put us out of action, lock us away in a dreary backwater of London's East End, trapped in a time-loop in perpetuity. Her evil is all around us! I can hear the heart beat of a killer. She's out there somewhere. We must be on our guard and we must stop her before she destroys all of my other selves! Oh... Good luck, my dears!|sign=|source=}}\n\nThe [[Seventh Doctor]] and [[Ace (Doctor Who)|Ace]] are confused when the [[TARDIS]] lands in [[Greenwich]], near the [[Cutty Sark]], thanks to the Rani's attack on the TARDIS. The Doctor finds a newspaper showing the year to be 1973, but before he can make any more conclusions, the Rani causes time to jump. Ace finds herself in [[Albert Square]] in 1993 with the [[Sixth Doctor]]. Local resident [[Sanjay Kapoor (EastEnders)|Sanjay]] tries to sell Ace some new clothes from his stall, and when his wife [[Gita Kapoor|Gita]] tells the Sixth Doctor that it is going to be all the rage in 1994, the Rani jumps time again.\n\nThe [[Third Doctor]] and [[Mel Bush]] appear from the time jump, and question an old [[Pauline Fowler]] and [[Kathy Beale]] on when they are. When Pauline and Kathy reply that it is 2013, another time jump occurs. In 1973, Pauline and Kathy remember the assassination of [[John F. Kennedy|President Kennedy]], while Kathy tells off a young [[Ian Beale]]. The Sixth Doctor and [[Susan Foreman]] appear, but she wonders what has happened to 'her' Doctor, the First.\n\nAfter another time jump to 2013, Susan changes into [[Sarah Jane Smith]] and the Doctor changes from the Sixth to the Third Doctor. They start to piece together what is happening to them, but the Rani lets loose her menagerie of specimens, including a [[Cyberman]], Fifi (from ''[[The Happiness Patrol]]''), a [[Sea Devil (Doctor Who)|Sea Devil]], an [[Ogron]] and a [[Time Lord]] from [[Gallifrey]] in the next time jump. In 1993, the [[Fifth Doctor]], [[Nyssa (Doctor Who)|Nyssa]] and [[Perpugilliam Brown|Peri]] are attacked by the Rani's menagerie, and after they tried to warn [[Pat Butcher]] of the danger, the Rani stops them outside the [[Queen Vic]].\n\nIn 1993, after the Fifth Doctor changed to the Third Doctor in the next time jump, with [[Liz Shaw]], the Rani took control of Liz's mind. As [[Mandy Salter]] tries to stop the Rani, [[Mike Yates|Captain Mike Yates]] of [[UNIT]] comes in Bessie to save the Third Doctor and get him to [[Brigadier Lethbridge-Stewart|The Brigadier]] who is waiting for them.\n\nAfter another time jump, the Doctor changed to the [[Sixth Doctor]] and after he says goodbye to the Brigadier time jumps again.  In 1993, at the Arches, [[Phil Mitchell|Phil]] and [[Grant Mitchell (EastEnders)|Grant Mitchell]] find [[Romana (Doctor Who)|Romana]] looking for the Doctor, but they point her to [[Harold Legg|Dr. Harold Legg]]. As Romana walks past the [[Queen Vic]], the Rani captures her, in front of [[Frank Butcher]].\n\nBack in 1973, the Third Doctor explains to [[Victoria Waterfield]] who the Rani was and thinks that her control is breaking down, as they return to the TARDIS.\n\nAfter the Seventh Doctor lands the TARDIS in 1993, [[Leela (Doctor Who)|Leela]] escapes from the Rani, after being cloned in the form of Romana. This results in an additional [[Time Lord]] brain imprint being left on the computer inside the Rani's TARDIS instead of the human one she needed, which gives the Seventh Doctor, Ace, and [[K-9 (Doctor Who)|K9]] the edge needed to rig up a device to overload it, sending the Rani into the time tunnel where she had trapped the First and Second Doctors and freeing the Doctors' other selves from the loop. As the Seventh Doctor and Ace leave in the TARDIS, the Doctor observes \"Certainly, I \u2014 I mean, we \u2014 are difficult to get rid of.\"\n\n==Production==\n\n===Cast notes===\n*This was the final official appearance of [[Jon Pertwee]] as the [[Third Doctor]]; Pertwee died three years later. \n*[[Tom Baker]] returned to the role of the [[Fourth Doctor]] on television for the first time since leaving it 12 years previously, though he had recorded links for the video release of the incomplete \"[[Shada (Doctor Who)|Shada]]\" the year before. Baker was reluctant to take part as he hated the script and his scenes were re-written by himself at the last minute. [[Tom Baker]] would later return to the series in 2013's [[The Day of the Doctor]] in which he appears as ''\"The Curator\"'' who may or may not be a future incarnation of the Doctor himself. He will reprise the role in [[Big Finish Productions|Big Finish Productions']] ''\"Doctor Who: Stranded\"'', alongside [[Paul McGann]] as the [[Eighth Doctor]].\n*This special marks the first time that [[Peter Davison]] returned as the [[Fifth Doctor]], 9 years since he stepped down from the role after filming \"[[The Caves of Androzani]]\". He would later reprise the role again in the 2007 Mini-Episode broadcast for Children In Need \"[[Time Crash]]\" alongside his future son-in-law [[David Tennant]] as the [[Tenth Doctor]].\n*It is, to date, the final on-screen appearance of [[Colin Baker]] as the [[Sixth Doctor]].  \n*This is the last appearance on television of [[Caroline John]] as [[Liz Shaw]] (John died in 2012) and [[Deborah Watling]] as [[Victoria Waterfield]] (Watling died in 2017).\n*In February 1993, [[Sophie Aldred]] had guest-starred in a two-episode arc on ''EastEnders'' as Suzi.<ref>''EastEnders'' episodes dated 2 February 1993 and 4 February 1993</ref> She appears in ''Dimensions in Time'' as [[Ace (Doctor Who)|Ace]], her character from ''Doctor Who'' and the final [[Companion (Doctor Who)|companion]] of the classic era.

The trading settlement and the island were named after the archangel [[Michael (archangel)|Michael]].\n\n[[Fort St. Michael]], a U.S. military post, was established in 1897. During the [[Klondike Gold Rush|gold rush of 1897]], it was a major gateway to the Alaskan interior via the [[Yukon River]] Delta (located about {{convert|40|mi|km|abbr=}} to the southwest). As many as 10,000 persons were said to live in St. Michael during the gold rush. St. Michael was also a popular trading post for Alaska Natives to trade their goods for Western supplies. Centralization of many Yup'iks from the surrounding villages intensified after the measles epidemic of 1900 and the influenza epidemic of 1918.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20090304043242/http://www.kawerak.org/tribalHomePages/stMichael/index.html HISTORY  ] retrieved Dec 14, 2012</ref>\n\nSt. Michael's population today is largely Yup'ik.  Many residents are also descendants of the Russian traders.\n\n==Economy==\nThe St. Michael economy is based on subsistence food harvests (hunting, fishing and gardening) supplemented by part-time wage earning.  Most wage-earning positions are in city government, the IRA council and village corporation, schools and local stores.  Some residents hold commercial fishing permits, primarily for the herring fishery.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commons category-inline|position=left}}\n\n{{Nome Census Area, Alaska}}\n\n{{authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Saint Michael, Alaska}}\n[[Category:Cities in Alaska]]\n[[Category:Cities in Nome Census Area, Alaska]]\n[[Category:Populated coastal places in Alaska]]\n[[Category:Populated places established in 1833]]\n[[Category:1833 establishments in the Russian Empire]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox settlement\n|official_name            = St. Michael\n|native_name              = Taciq\n|settlement_type          = [[City (Alaska)|City]]\n|nickname                 = \n|motto                    = <!-- Images -->\n|image_skyline            = \n|imagesize                = \n|image_caption            = \n|image_flag               = \n|image_seal               = <!-- Maps -->\n|pushpin_map  = USA Alaska\n|pushpin_map_caption  = Location in Alaska\n\n<!-- Location -->\n|subdivision_type         = [[List of sovereign states|Country]]\n|subdivision_name         = [[United States]]\n|subdivision_type1        = [[U.S. state|State]]\n|subdivision_name1        = [[Alaska]]\n|subdivision_type2        = [[List of boroughs and census areas in Alaska|Census Area]]\n|subdivision_name2        = [[Nome Census Area, Alaska|Nome]]\n|government_footnotes     = \n|government_type          = \n|leader_title             = [[Mayor]]\n|leader_name              = Bobbi Andrews<ref>{{Cite book|title=2015 Alaska Municipal Officials Directory|location=Juneau|publisher=Alaska Municipal League|year=2015|page=136}}</ref>\n|leader_title1            = [[Alaska Senate|State senator]]\n|leader_name1             = [[Donald Olson]] ([[Democratic Party (United States)|D]])\n|leader_title2            = [[Alaska House of Representatives|State rep.]]\n|leader_name2             = [[Neal Foster]] (D)\n|established_title        = [[Municipal corporation|Incorporated]]\n|established_date         = July 15, 1969<ref>{{cite book|title=1996 Alaska Municipal Officials Directory|location=[[Juneau]]|publisher=Alaska Municipal League/[[Alaska Department of Commerce, Community and Economic Development|Alaska Department of Community and Regional Affairs]]|date=January 1996|page=130}}</ref>\n\n<!-- Area -->\n|area_footnotes           = <ref name=\"CenPopGazetteer2016\">{{cite web|title=2018 U.S. Gazetteer Files|url=https://www2.census.gov/geo/docs/maps-data/data/gazetteer/2018_Gazetteer/2018_gaz_place_02.txt|publisher=United States Census Bureau|accessdate=Jul 1, 2019}}</ref>\n|area_magnitude           = \n|area_total_km2           = 72.69\n|area_land_km2            = 56.33\n|area_water_km2           = 16.36\n|area_total_sq_mi         = 28.06\n|area_land_sq_mi          = 21.75\n|area_water_sq_mi         = 6.32\n\n<!-- Population -->\n|population_as_of         = [[2010 United States Census|2010]]\n|population_footnotes     = <ref name=\"GR1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/geographies/reference-files/time-series/geo/gazetteer-files.html|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2011-04-23|date=2011-02-12|title=US Gazetteer files: 2010, 2000, and 1990}}</ref>\n|population_total         = 401\n|population_density_km2   = 7.37\n|population_density_sq_mi = 19.08\n|timezone                 = [[Alaska Time Zone|Alaska (AKST)]]\n|utc_offset               = -9\n|timezone_DST             = AKDT\n|utc_offset_DST           = -8\n|elevation_footnotes      = \n|elevation_m              = 8\n|elevation_ft             = 26\n|coordinates              = {{coord|63|28|16|N|162|3|11|W|region:US-AK|display=inline,title}}\n|postal_code_type         = [[ZIP code]]\n|postal_code              = 99659\n|area_code                = [[Area code 907|907]]\n|area_code_type           = [[North American Numbering Plan|Area code]]\n|blank_name               = [[Federal Information Processing Standard|FIPS code]]\n|blank_info               = 02-66360\n|blank1_name              = [[Geographic Names Information System|GNIS]] feature ID\n|blank1_info              = {{GNIS 4|1408977}}  \n|website                  = \n|footnotes                = \n|pop_est_as_of = 2018\n|pop_est_footnotes = <ref name=\"USCensusEst2018\"/>\n|population_est = 415\n|unit_pref = Imperial\n}}\n'''St. Michael''' (''Taciq'' in [[Central Alaskan Yup'ik language|Central Alaskan Yup'ik]], {{lang-ru|\u0421\u0435\u043d\u0442-\u041c\u0430\u0439\u043a\u043b}}), historically referred to as '''Saint Michael''',  is a city in [[Nome Census Area, Alaska]].

Anthony A. Andrews School serves grades Pre-K through 12 grades.\n\n==History==\n[[Image:New-racket-steamer.jpg|thumb|The steamer ''New Racket'' hired by Al and [[Ed Schieffelin]] at the wharf of St. Michael, Alaska, in 1888 before its departure for the Yukon River.]]\n[[St. Michael Redoubt Site|Redoubt St. Michael]] was founded in 1833 by traders of the [[Russian-American Company]], as a trading post for trade with the [[Yup'ik]] people of the area. The trading settlement and the island were named after the archangel [[Michael (archangel)|Michael]].\n\n[[Fort St. Michael]], a U.S. military post, was established in 1897. During the [[Klondike Gold Rush|gold rush of 1897]], it was a major gateway to the Alaskan interior via the [[Yukon River]] Delta (located about {{convert|40|mi|km|abbr=}} to the southwest). As many as 10,000 persons were said to live in St. Michael during the gold rush. St. Michael was also a popular trading post for Alaska Natives to trade their goods for Western supplies. Centralization of many Yup'iks from the surrounding villages intensified after the measles epidemic of 1900 and the influenza epidemic of 1918.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20090304043242/http://www.kawerak.org/tribalHomePages/stMichael/index.html HISTORY  ] retrieved Dec 14, 2012</ref>\n\nSt. Michael's population today is largely Yup'ik.  Many residents are also descendants of the Russian traders.\n\n==Economy==\nThe St. Michael economy is based on subsistence food harvests (hunting, fishing and gardening) supplemented by part-time wage earning.  Most wage-earning positions are in city government, the IRA council and village corporation, schools and local stores.  Some residents hold commercial fishing permits, primarily for the herring fishery.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commons category-inline|position=left}}\n\n{{Nome Census Area, Alaska}}\n\n{{authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Saint Michael, Alaska}}\n[[Category:Cities in Alaska]]\n[[Category:Cities in Nome Census Area, Alaska]]\n[[Category:Populated coastal places in Alaska]]\n[[Category:Populated places established in 1833]]\n[[Category:1833 establishments in the Russian Empire]]\n", "name_user": "Menchi", "label": "safe", "comment": "langtags", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Michael,_Alaska"}

In 1893, the three territories came under a [[French colonial empire|French protectorate]] and were united to form what is now known as Laos.

Laos became independent in 1953, with a [[constitutional monarchy]] under [[Sisavang Vong]]. A post-independence [[Laos Civil War|civil war]] began, which saw the [[Lao People's Revolutionary Party|communist resistance]], supported by the [[Soviet Union]], fight against the monarchy that later came under influence of military regimes supported by the [[United States]]. After the [[Vietnam War]] ended in 1975, the [[Communism|communist]] [[Pathet Lao]] came to power, ending the civil war.

The scheme was aborted in the 1930s. The major roads connecting the major urban centres, in particular [[Route 13 (Laos)|Route 13]], have been significantly upgraded in recent years, but villages far from major roads can be reached only through unpaved roads that may not be accessible year-round.{{Citation needed|date=January 2019}}\n\nThere is limited external and internal telecommunication, but mobile phones have become widespread in urban centres.

In the north, in what is now Eritrea, Ethiopia managed to repulse [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] [[Ottoman conquest of Habesh|invasion]] attempts, although losing its access to the [[Red Sea]] to them.\n\nReacting to these challenges, Ethiopia started to expand westwards, conquering the [[Lake Tana]] area and much of [[Beta Israel]] territory in [[Begemder]]. In the 1630s Emperor [[Fasilides]] founded the new capital of [[Gondar]], marking the start for a new golden age known as \"Gondarine period\". It saw a relative peace, the successful integration of the Oromo and a flourishing of culture. With the deaths of Emperor [[Iyasu II]] (1755) and especially [[Iyoas I]] (1769) the realm eventually entered a period of decentralization, known as [[Zemene Mesafint|\"Era of the Princes\"]]. The [[Shewa]] region factually seceded and constituted a kingdom of its own, while within the Empire, regional warlords contested for power, with the Emperor being barely more than a mere puppet.\n\nEmperor [[Tewodros II]] (r. 1855\u20131868) put an end into that state, reunified the Empire and led it into the modern period before dying during the [[British Expedition to Abyssinia]]. His successor [[Yohannes IV]] engaged primarily in war and successfully fought [[Ethiopian-Egyptian War|the Egyptians]] and the [[Mahdist Sudan|Mahdists]] before dying against the latter in the [[Battle of Gallabat]] in 1889. Emperor [[Menelik II]], now residing in the recently founded town of [[Addis Abeba]], continued and concluded the policy of expansion of his predecessor, subjugating many people and kingdoms in what is now western, southern and eastern Ethiopia, like [[Kingdom of Kaffa|Kaffa]], [[Welayta people#History|Wolaytta]] or [[Aussa Sultanate|Aussa]]. Thus, he gave Ethiopia the geographical extent it has today. In the north he was confronted with an expanding [[Kingdom of Italy|Italy]]. Decisively defeating it at the [[Battle of Adwa]] in 1896 with the aid of [[Russian Empire|Russia]] and France, Menelik ensured Ethiopia's independence and [[Italian Eritrea|confined Italy to Eritrea]].\n\nLater, after the [[Second Italo-Ethiopian War]], the [[Italian Empire]] occupied Ethiopia and established the [[Italian East Africa]] colony in the region. After World War II, the Italians were driven out with the help of the British army. The country was one of the founding members of the [[United Nations]], and in 1962 annexed Eritrea. However, the [[Ethiopian Civil War]] led to the [[Eritrean War of Independence|independence of Eritrea]] and fall of the Empire in 1974.\n\nBy 1974, Ethiopia was one of only three countries in the world to have the title of [[Emperor]] for its head of state, together with [[Japan]] and [[Iran]] under the [[Pahlavi dynasty]]. It was the second-to-last country in Africa to use the title of Emperor; the only one later was the [[Central African Empire]], which was implemented between 1976 and 1979 by [[Emperor of Central Africa|Emperor]] [[Jean-B\u00e9del Bokassa|Bokassa I]].\n\n==History==\n===D'mt and Kingdom of Aksum===\n{{Main|D\u02bfmt|Kingdom of Aksum}}\n[[File:Axumite Jar Spout (2822628227).jpg|thumb|left|A [[Kingdom of Aksum]] jar spout]]\nEthiopia's human occupation began early, as evidenced by the findings{{Which|date=July 2018}}.

Notable philosophers from that area are [[Zera Yacob (philosopher)|Zera Yacob]] and [[Walda Heywat]].

This was a period of Ethiopian history with numerous conflicts between the various [[Ethiopian aristocratic and court titles#Ras|ras]] (equivalent to the English [[duke]]s) and the emperor, who had only limited power and only dominated the area around the contemporary capital of [[Gondar]]. Both the development of society and culture stagnated in this period.

In the aftermath of the war Italy annexed Ethiopia, uniting it with Italy's other colonies in eastern Africa to form the new colony of Italian East Africa, and [[Victor Emmanuel III of Italy]] adopted the title \"Emperor of Abyssinia\".\n\nOn 10 June 1940, Italy declared war on the United Kingdom and France, as France was in the process of being conquered by [[Germany]] at the time and [[Benito Mussolini]] wished to expand Italy's colonial holdings. The [[Italian conquest of British Somaliland]] in August 1940 was successful, but the war turned against Italy afterward. [[Haile Selassie]] returned to Ethiopia from England to help rally the resistance.

In the north, in what is now Eritrea, Ethiopia managed to repulse [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] [[Ottoman conquest of Habesh|invasion]] attempts, although losing its access to the [[Red Sea]] to them.\n\nReacting to these challenges, Ethiopia started to expand westwards, conquering the [[Lake Tana]] area and much of [[Beta Israel]] territory in [[Begemder]]. In the 1630s Emperor [[Fasilides]] founded the new capital of [[Gondar]], marking the start for a new golden age known as \"Gondarine period\". It saw a relative peace, the successful integration of the Oromo and a flourishing of culture. With the deaths of Emperor [[Iyasu II]] (1755) and especially [[Iyoas I]] (1769) the realm eventually entered a period of decentralization, known as [[Zemene Mesafint|\"Era of the Princes\"]]. The [[Shewa]] region factually seceded and constituted a kingdom of its own, while within the Empire, regional warlords contested for power, with the Emperor being barely more than a mere puppet.\n\nEmperor [[Tewodros II]] (r. 1855\u20131868) put an end into that state, reunified the Empire and led it into the modern period before dying during the [[British Expedition to Abyssinia]]. His successor [[Yohannes IV]] engaged primarily in war and successfully fought [[Ethiopian-Egyptian War|the Egyptians]] and the [[Mahdist Sudan|Mahdists]] before dying against the latter in the [[Battle of Gallabat]] in 1889. Emperor [[Menelik II]], now residing in the recently founded town of [[Addis Abeba]], continued and concluded the policy of expansion of his predecessor, subjugating many people and kingdoms in what is now western, southern and eastern Ethiopia, like [[Kingdom of Kaffa|Kaffa]], [[Welayta people#History|Wolaytta]] or [[Aussa Sultanate|Aussa]]. Thus, he gave Ethiopia the geographical extent it has today. In the north he was confronted with an expanding [[Kingdom of Italy|Italy]]. Decisively defeating it at the [[Battle of Adwa]] in 1896 with the aid of [[Russian Empire|Russia]] and France, Menelik ensured Ethiopia's independence and [[Italian Eritrea|confined Italy to Eritrea]].\n\nLater, after the [[Second Italo-Ethiopian War]], the [[Italian Empire]] occupied Ethiopia and established the [[Italian East Africa]] colony in the region. After World War II, the Italians were driven out with the help of the British army. The country was one of the founding members of the [[United Nations]], and in 1962 annexed Eritrea. However, the [[Ethiopian Civil War]] led to the [[Eritrean War of Independence|independence of Eritrea]] and fall of the Empire in 1974.\n\nBy 1974, Ethiopia was one of only three countries in the world to have the title of [[Emperor]] for its head of state, together with [[Japan]] and [[Iran]] under the [[Pahlavi dynasty]]. It was the second-to-last country in Africa to use the title of Emperor; the only one later was the [[Central African Empire]], which was implemented between 1976 and 1979 by [[Emperor of Central Africa|Emperor]] [[Jean-B\u00e9del Bokassa|Bokassa I]].\n\n==History==\n===D'mt and Kingdom of Aksum===\n{{Main|D\u02bfmt|Kingdom of Aksum}}\n[[File:Axumite Jar Spout (2822628227).jpg|thumb|left|A [[Kingdom of Aksum]] jar spout]]\nEthiopia's human occupation began early, as evidenced by the findings{{Which|date=July 2018}}.

Notable philosophers from that area are [[Zera Yacob (philosopher)|Zera Yacob]] and [[Walda Heywat]].

This was a period of Ethiopian history with numerous conflicts between the various [[Ethiopian aristocratic and court titles#Ras|ras]] (equivalent to the English [[duke]]s) and the emperor, who had only limited power and only dominated the area around the contemporary capital of [[Gondar]].

Italian troops used [[sulfur mustard]] in [[chemical warfare]], ignoring the [[Geneva Protocol]] that it had signed seven years earlier. The Italian military dropped mustard gas in bombs, sprayed it from airplanes and spread it in powdered form on the ground. 150,000 chemical casualties were reported, mostly from mustard gas. In the aftermath of the war Italy annexed Ethiopia, uniting it with Italy's other colonies in eastern Africa to form the new colony of Italian East Africa, and [[Victor Emmanuel III of Italy]] adopted the title \"Emperor of Abyssinia\".\n\nOn 10 June 1940, Italy declared war on the United Kingdom and France, as France was in the process of being conquered by [[Germany]] at the time and [[Benito Mussolini]] wished to expand Italy's colonial holdings. The [[Italian conquest of British Somaliland]] in August 1940 was successful, but the war turned against Italy afterward. [[Haile Selassie]] returned to Ethiopia from England to help rally the resistance. The British began [[East African Campaign (World War II)|their own invasion in January 1941]] with the help of Ethiopian freedom fighters, and the last organized Italian resistance in Italian East Africa surrendered in November 1941, ending Italian rule.\n\n===Fall of monarchy===\n[[File:Haile Selassie (1969).jpg|thumb|[[Haile Selassie]] was the last Emperor of the Ethiopian Empire.]]\nIn 1974 a pro-Soviet [[Marxism\u2013Leninism|Marxist\u2013Leninist]] [[Military dictatorship|military junta]], the \"[[Derg]]\", led by [[Mengistu Haile Mariam]], deposed [[Haile Selassie]] and established a [[socialist republic]].
