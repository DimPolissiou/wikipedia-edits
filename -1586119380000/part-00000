As with all other Queen performances since 1997, longstanding bassist [[John Deacon]] has declined to participate in the project due to his retirement. This is the first long-term collaboration of Queen since the [[Queen + Paul Rodgers]] project ended in 2009. Like the previous project, it was made clear that Lambert would not be replacing Queen frontman [[Freddie Mercury]], but rather that he would be featured with the band's active members. The collaboration originated when May and Taylor appeared on ''[[American Idol (season 8)|American Idol]]'' in 2009 when Lambert was a contestant. They began performing occasionally in 2011, conducted a short [[Queen + Adam Lambert Tour 2012|European tour]] in 2012, and in 2014 announced a world tour, the [[Queen + Adam Lambert Tour 2014\u20132015]] with dates in North America, Australia, New Zealand, Asia, Europe and South America. In the summer of 2016, the group performed several dates as part of a festival tour in Europe and several dates in Asia. The next year, the group announced a second worldwide tour scheduled for 2017 and 2018 and later announced a short United Kingdom tour for 2020.\n\nJoining May, Taylor and Lambert are long-time Queen touring keyboardist [[Spike Edney]], bassist Neil Fairclough and percussionist Tyler Warren. Although there are currently no plans to release a studio album with this lineup, May and Taylor have stated that there is a possibility of the group recording original material.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ultimateclassicrock.com/queen-recording-adam-lambert/|title=Queen Hint at Recording New Material with Adam Lambert|work=Ultimate Classic Rock}}</ref>\n\n==Origin==\nQueen and Lambert first performed together in 2009 when Queen members Brian May and Roger Taylor appeared as guests on the [[American Idol (season 8)|eighth season of ''American Idol'']] on which Lambert was a contestant.

Sultan Sidi [[Mohammed ben Abdallah|Muhammad Ibn Abdullah]] actively sought to have an American diplomat negotiate a formal treaty, but meanwhile Moroccan pirates threatened American merchant shipping in the [[Mediterranean Sea]]. Finally, [[Thomas Barclay (1728 - 1793)|Thomas Barclay]], the American consul in France, arrived in Morocco in 1786. There he negotiated the [[Moroccan\u2013American Treaty of Friendship]] which was signed later that year in [[Europe]] by American diplomats [[John Adams]] and [[Thomas Jefferson]] and ratified by the [[Congress of the Confederation|Confederation Congress]] (under the earlier [[Articles of Confederation|Articles of Confederation and Perpetual Union]] government) in July 1787.<ref>Priscilla H.

On December 1, 1789, eight months into his presidency, Washington speaks on his authority and leadership of the United States and the miscommunication between Morocco and America. In the letter, Washington expresses his regrets in lack of punctuality but clarifies that the untimely response was due to change in government and the want to communicate on solidified terms. Washington also shows appreciation for Muhammed Ibn Abdullah's diplomatic initiative tactics in protection of American ships from pirates. These actions are appreciated because of the lack of power United States as a country had held at the moment. Morocco was one of the first Arab, African, Muslim states to sign a treaty with America. America temporarily lacked a navy at the time, and could not defend its ships in the Mediterranean.\n\n=== Abd ar-Rahman ===\nIn 1826, Sultan [[Abd al-Rahman of Morocco|Abd ar-Rahman]] intervened on behalf of [[Abdulrahman Ibrahim Ibn Sori]], a Muslim [[Fula people|Fula]] nobleman enslaved in the US, after having read a letter Sori had sent to his family in Africa.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.history.com/news/african-prince-slavery-abdulrahman-ibrahim-ibn-sori|title=How an African Prince Who Was Kidnapped Into Slavery Outsmarted His Captors|last=Higgins|first=Abigail|website=HISTORY|language=en|access-date=2020-01-23}}</ref> [[Andrew Jackson]] capitalized on this event in his campaign against President [[John Quincy Adams]] .<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n[[File:Raphael Semmes.jpg|thumb|Portrait of Admiral [[Raphael Semmes]] who represented the [[Confederate States of America]] to Morocco during the [[American Civil War]] though Morocco never formally recognized the Confederate States.]]\n\n===American Civil War===\nDuring the [[American Civil War]], Morocco reaffirmed its diplomatic alliance with the United States ([[Union (American Civil War)|Union]]). Morocco also became the scene of a colorful foreign relations and [[political warfare]] episode involving the Kingdom of Morocco, the United States of America, the [[Confederate States of America]], France, and Great Britain.\n \nIn 1862 Confederate diplomats Henry Myers and Tom Tate Tunstall were arrested outside the American Consulate in Tangier after making disparaging remarks about the United States and its flag. American consul, James De Long overheard their jeers and asked Moroccan police to seize the men. When word reached Confederate Admiral [[Raphael Semmes]] who was acting as the Confederate diplomat in the area, he sent out dispatches to as many neutral diplomats as he had contact with, including the British Consul to Morocco, John Drummond Hay. Semmes asked Hay to get involved and encourage Morocco to release the prisoners, to which Hay responded that he could only convey the message but not offer any recommendation for actions, as offering a recommendation would violate Britain's terms of neutrality. Semmes tried a similar tactic with the French consul, but without success.\n\nEventually, European citizens living in Morocco rallied outside the American consulate demanding the prisoners' release. During the heat of the protest, American Lt. Commander Josiah Creesey drew his sword, which caused the mob to throw rocks. After the episode, the Moroccan government sent official word to Semmes that they could not meet with him to discuss the situation, because the two nations did not have formal diplomatic relations. Eventually, the Union officials ordered the two prisoners be sent to Fort Warren prison in Boston by way of [[Cadiz, Spain]]. Only after the French intervened while the ship was docked in Cadiz did President [[Abraham Lincoln]] issue an official order to release the prisoners.<ref>For a detailed description of the event, see: Abu-Talib, Mohammed, \u201cMorocco and the American Civil War\u201d in ''The Atlantic Connection: 200 Years of Moroccan-American Relations 1786\u20131986'', Bookin-Weiner and El Mansour eds.

Having been irritated by Morocco's response, the Confederate States were never able to recover and manage relations with Morocco. In 1863, the King of Morocco released an official order stating in part: \"... the Confederate States of America are fighting the government with whom we are in friendship and good relations... if any vessel of the so-called Confederate states enters your port, it shall not be received, but you must order it away on pain of seizure; and you will act on this subject in cooperation with the United States....\"<ref>Abu-Talib, Mohammed, \u201cMorocco and the American Civil War\u201d in ''The Atlantic Connection: 200 Years of Moroccan-American Relations 1786\u20131986'', Bookin-Weiner and El Mansour eds.

The Treaty, ratified by Morocco, President Andrew Johnson, and nine European heads of state, granted neutrality to the lighthouse, with the condition that the ten naval powers signing the agreement assumed responsibility for its maintenance.\n\nAround the turn of the 20th century, as European colonizers gazed hungrily at Morocco's resources and strategically located harbors, the United States strongly defended the Kingdom's right to its continued sovereignty at the [[Conference of Madrid]] (1880), and again at the [[Algeciras Conference]] in 1906. In fact, the European powers were edging towards engaging in a continental war because of Morocco in 1905. President [[Theodore Roosevelt]] played an important role in settling the affair during the 1906 Algeciras Conference.  Elihu Root, his Secretary of State, declared, \"Fair play is what the United States asks - for Morocco and for all the interested nations - and it confidently expects that outcome.\u201d<ref>{{cite book|last=Serge|first=Ricard|title=A Companion to Theodore Roosevelt|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell, John Wiley & Sons|date=2011|page=}} citing Papers Relating to the Foreign Relations of the United States, 1905-1906, 28 November 1905, Washington DC, GPO 1906-1909</ref> President Roosevelt offered a compromise plan which the European powers accepted.

In 1917 and 1918, Moroccan soldiers fought victoriously alongside U.S. Marines at Chateau Thierry, Mont Blanc and Soissons.\n\nWith France occupied by the [[Nazis]] during World War II, colonial French Morocco initially sided with the [[Axis Powers]]. When the Allies invaded Morocco on November 8, 1942, Moroccan defenders yielded to the American and British invaders. Shortly after Morocco surrendered, President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] sent a message to Morocco's King, H.E. Mohammed V, commending him on the \u201cadmirable spirit of cooperation that is animating you and your people in their relationships with the forces of my country.

Sultan Sidi [[Mohammed ben Abdallah|Muhammad Ibn Abdullah]] actively sought to have an American diplomat negotiate a formal treaty, but meanwhile Moroccan pirates threatened American merchant shipping in the [[Mediterranean Sea]]. Finally, [[Thomas Barclay (1728 - 1793)|Thomas Barclay]], the American consul in France, arrived in Morocco in 1786. There he negotiated the [[Moroccan\u2013American Treaty of Friendship]] which was signed later that year in [[Europe]] by American diplomats [[John Adams]] and [[Thomas Jefferson]] and ratified by the [[Congress of the Confederation|Confederation Congress]] (under the earlier [[Articles of Confederation|Articles of Confederation and Perpetual Union]] government) in July 1787.<ref>Priscilla H.

On December 1, 1789, eight months into his presidency, Washington speaks on his authority and leadership of the United States and the miscommunication between Morocco and America. In the letter, Washington expresses his regrets in lack of punctuality but clarifies that the untimely response was due to change in government and the want to communicate on solidified terms. Washington also shows appreciation for Muhammed Ibn Abdullah's diplomatic initiative tactics in protection of American ships from pirates. These actions are appreciated because of the lack of power United States as a country had held at the moment. Morocco was one of the first Arab, African, Muslim states to sign a treaty with America. America temporarily lacked a navy at the time, and could not defend its ships in the Mediterranean.\n\n=== Abd ar-Rahman ===\nIn 1826, Sultan [[Abd al-Rahman of Morocco|Abd ar-Rahman]] intervened on behalf of [[Abdulrahman Ibrahim Ibn Sori]], a Muslim [[Fula people|Fula]] nobleman enslaved in the US, after having read a letter Sori had sent to his family in Africa.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.history.com/news/african-prince-slavery-abdulrahman-ibrahim-ibn-sori|title=How an African Prince Who Was Kidnapped Into Slavery Outsmarted His Captors|last=Higgins|first=Abigail|website=HISTORY|language=en|access-date=2020-01-23}}</ref> [[Andrew Jackson]] capitalized on this event in his campaign against President [[John Quincy Adams]] .<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n[[File:Raphael Semmes.jpg|thumb|Portrait of Admiral [[Raphael Semmes]] who represented the [[Confederate States of America]] to Morocco during the [[American Civil War]] though Morocco never formally recognized the Confederate States.]]\n\n===American Civil War===\nDuring the [[American Civil War]], Morocco reaffirmed its diplomatic alliance with the United States ([[Union (American Civil War)|Union]]). Morocco also became the scene of a colorful foreign relations and [[political warfare]] episode involving the Kingdom of Morocco, the United States of America, the [[Confederate States of America]], France, and Great Britain.\n \nIn 1862 Confederate diplomats Henry Myers and Tom Tate Tunstall were arrested outside the American Consulate in Tangier after making disparaging remarks about the United States and its flag. American consul, James De Long overheard their jeers and asked Moroccan police to seize the men. When word reached Confederate Admiral [[Raphael Semmes]] who was acting as the Confederate diplomat in the area, he sent out dispatches to as many neutral diplomats as he had contact with, including the British Consul to Morocco, John Drummond Hay. Semmes asked Hay to get involved and encourage Morocco to release the prisoners, to which Hay responded that he could only convey the message but not offer any recommendation for actions, as offering a recommendation would violate Britain's terms of neutrality. Semmes tried a similar tactic with the French consul, but without success.\n\nEventually, European citizens living in Morocco rallied outside the American consulate demanding the prisoners' release. During the heat of the protest, American Lt. Commander Josiah Creesey drew his sword, which caused the mob to throw rocks. After the episode, the Moroccan government sent official word to Semmes that they could not meet with him to discuss the situation, because the two nations did not have formal diplomatic relations. Eventually, the Union officials ordered the two prisoners be sent to Fort Warren prison in Boston by way of [[Cadiz, Spain]]. Only after the French intervened while the ship was docked in Cadiz did President [[Abraham Lincoln]] issue an official order to release the prisoners.<ref>For a detailed description of the event, see: Abu-Talib, Mohammed, \u201cMorocco and the American Civil War\u201d in ''The Atlantic Connection: 200 Years of Moroccan-American Relations 1786\u20131986'', Bookin-Weiner and El Mansour eds.

Having been irritated by Morocco's response, the Confederate States were never able to recover and manage relations with Morocco. In 1863, the King of Morocco released an official order stating in part: \"... the Confederate States of America are fighting the government with whom we are in friendship and good relations... if any vessel of the so-called Confederate states enters your port, it shall not be received, but you must order it away on pain of seizure; and you will act on this subject in cooperation with the United States....\"<ref>Abu-Talib, Mohammed, \u201cMorocco and the American Civil War\u201d in ''The Atlantic Connection: 200 Years of Moroccan-American Relations 1786\u20131986'', Bookin-Weiner and El Mansour eds.

The Treaty, ratified by Morocco, President Andrew Johnson, and nine European heads of state, granted neutrality to the lighthouse, with the condition that the ten naval powers signing the agreement assumed responsibility for its maintenance.\n\nAround the turn of the 20th century, as European colonizers gazed hungrily at Morocco's resources and strategically located harbors, the United States strongly defended the Kingdom's right to its continued sovereignty at the [[Conference of Madrid]] (1880), and again at the [[Algeciras Conference]] in 1906. In fact, the European powers were edging towards engaging in a continental war because of Morocco in 1905. President [[Theodore Roosevelt]] played an important role in settling the affair during the 1906 Algeciras Conference.  Elihu Root, his Secretary of State, declared, \"Fair play is what the United States asks - for Morocco and for all the interested nations - and it confidently expects that outcome.\u201d<ref>{{cite book|last=Serge|first=Ricard|title=A Companion to Theodore Roosevelt|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell, John Wiley & Sons|date=2011|page=}} citing Papers Relating to the Foreign Relations of the United States, 1905-1906, 28 November 1905, Washington DC, GPO 1906-1909</ref> President Roosevelt offered a compromise plan which the European powers accepted.

In 1917 and 1918, Moroccan soldiers fought victoriously alongside U.S. Marines at Chateau Thierry, Mont Blanc and Soissons.\n\nWith France occupied by the [[Nazis]] during World War II, colonial French Morocco initially sided with the [[Axis Powers]]. When the Allies invaded Morocco on November 8, 1942, Moroccan defenders yielded to the American and British invaders. Shortly after Morocco surrendered, President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] sent a message to Morocco's King, H.E. Mohammed V, commending him on the \u201cadmirable spirit of cooperation that is animating you and your people in their relationships with the forces of my country.

It reported an average [[Newspaper circulation|circulation]] of 323,039 copies per issue in 2009, about 40,000 of which were sold abroad. It has had its own website since 19 December 1995, and is often the only French newspaper easily obtainable in non-French-speaking countries. It should not be confused with the monthly publication ''[[Le Monde diplomatique]]'', of which ''Le Monde'' has 51% ownership, but which is editorially independent.\n\nThe paper's journalistic side has a collegial form of organization, in which most journalists are not only tenured, but financial stakeholders in the enterprise as well, and participate in the elections of upper management and senior executives. In the 1990s and 2000s, La Vie-Le Monde Group expanded under editor [[Jean-Marie Colombani]] with a number of acquisitions. However, its profitability was not sufficient to cover the large debt loads it took on to fund this expansion, and it sought new investors in 2010 to keep the company out of [[bankruptcy]]. In June 2010, investors [[Matthieu Pigasse]], [[Pierre Berg\u00e9]], and [[Xavier Niel]] acquired a controlling stake in the newspaper.<ref name=\"Willsher2010\">{{cite web |last=Willsher |first=Kim |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/jun/28/tycoons-win-approval-of-le-monde-bid |title=Tycoons given go-ahead for financial takeover of Le Monde |work=The Guardian |date=28 June 2010}}</ref>\n\nIn contrast to other world newspapers such as ''[[The New York Times]]'', ''Le Monde'' was traditionally focused on offering analysis and opinion, as opposed to being a newspaper of record.

It reported an average [[Newspaper circulation|circulation]] of 323,039 copies per issue in 2009, about 40,000 of which were sold abroad. It has had its own website since 19 December 1995, and is often the only French newspaper easily obtainable in non-French-speaking countries. It should not be confused with the monthly publication ''[[Le Monde diplomatique]]'', of which ''Le Monde'' has 51% ownership, but which is editorially independent.\n\nThe paper's journalistic side has a collegial form of organization, in which most journalists are not only tenured, but financial stakeholders in the enterprise as well, and participate in the elections of upper management and senior executives. In the 1990s and 2000s, La Vie-Le Monde Group expanded under editor [[Jean-Marie Colombani]] with a number of acquisitions. However, its profitability was not sufficient to cover the large debt loads it took on to fund this expansion, and it sought new investors in 2010 to keep the company out of [[bankruptcy]]. In June 2010, investors [[Matthieu Pigasse]], [[Pierre Berg\u00e9]], and [[Xavier Niel]] acquired a controlling stake in the newspaper.<ref name=\"Willsher2010\">{{cite web |last=Willsher |first=Kim |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/jun/28/tycoons-win-approval-of-le-monde-bid |title=Tycoons given go-ahead for financial takeover of Le Monde |work=The Guardian |date=28 June 2010}}</ref>\n\nIn contrast to other world newspapers such as ''[[The New York Times]]'', ''Le Monde'' was traditionally focused on offering analysis and opinion, as opposed to being a newspaper of record.

The French Foreign Minister [[Th\u00e9ophile Delcass\u00e9]] saw the opportunity to stabilize the situation and expand the French overseas empire. General [[Hubert Lyautey]] wanted a more aggressive military policy using his French army based in Algeria. France decided to use both diplomacy and military force. With British approval, it would control the Sultan, ruling in his name and extending French control. British approval was received in the [[Entente Cordiale]] of 1904. The Germans, who had no established presence in the region, strongly protested.

Morocco protested the proposed referendum and took its case to the [[International Court of Justice]] at [[The Hague]], which ruled that despite historical \"ties of allegiance\" between Morocco and the tribes of Western Sahara, there was no legal justification for departing from the UN position on self-determination. Spain, meanwhile, had declared that even in the absence of a referendum, it intended to surrender political control of Western Sahara, and Spain, Morocco, and [[Mauritania]] convened a [[Madrid Accords|tripartite conference]] to resolve the territory's future.

The Polisario used Algerian bases for quick strikes against targets deep inside Morocco and Mauritania, as well as for operations in Western Sahara. In August 1979, after suffering military losses, Mauritania renounced its claim to Western Sahara and signed a peace treaty with the Polisario.

The sultan agreed to institute reforms that would transform Morocco into a constitutional monarchy with a democratic form of government. In February 1956, Morocco acquired limited home rule. Further negotiations for full independence culminated in the French-Moroccan Agreement signed in Paris on March 2, 1956.<ref name=\"LOCprof\" />\n\nOn April 7, 1956, France officially relinquished its protectorate in Morocco.

His rule saw significant political unrest, and the ruthless government response earned the period the name \"the [[Years of Lead (Morocco)|years of lead]]\". Hassan took personal control of the government as prime minister, and named a new cabinet. Aided by an advisory council, he drew up a new constitution, which was approved overwhelmingly in a December 1962 referendum.

A [[United Nations visiting mission to Spanish Sahara|UN visiting mission]] reported in October 1975 that an overwhelming majority of the Saharan people desired independence. Morocco protested the proposed referendum and took its case to the [[International Court of Justice]] at [[The Hague]], which ruled that despite historical \"ties of allegiance\" between Morocco and the tribes of Western Sahara, there was no legal justification for departing from the UN position on self-determination. Spain, meanwhile, had declared that even in the absence of a referendum, it intended to surrender political control of Western Sahara, and Spain, Morocco, and [[Mauritania]] convened a [[Madrid Accords|tripartite conference]] to resolve the territory\u2019s future. Spain also announced that it was opening independence talks with the Algerian-backed Saharan independence movement known as the [[Polisario Front]].<ref name=\"LOCprof\" />\n\nIn early 1976, Spain ceded the administration of the Western Sahara to Morocco and Mauritania. Morocco assumed control over the northern two-thirds of the territory, and conceded the remaining portion in the south to Mauritania. An assembly of Saharan tribal leaders duly acknowledged Moroccan sovereignty. However, buoyed by the increasing defection of tribal chiefs to its cause, the Polisario drew up a constitution, and announced the formation of the [[Saharawi Arab Democratic Republic]] (SADR), and itself formed [[government-in-exile]].<ref name=\"LOCprof\" />\n\nThe Moroccan government eventually sent a large portion of its combat forces into Western Sahara to confront the Polisario\u2019s forces, which were relatively small but well-equipped, highly mobile, and resourceful. The Polisario used Algerian bases for quick strikes against targets deep inside Morocco and Mauritania, as well as for operations in Western Sahara. In August 1979, after suffering military losses, Mauritania renounced its claim to Western Sahara and signed a peace treaty with the Polisario. Morocco then annexed the entire territory and, in 1985 built a [[Moroccan Wall|2,500-kilometer sand berm]] around three-quarters of Western Sahara.<ref name=\"LOCprof\" />\n\nIn 1988, Morocco and the Polisario Front agreed on a United Nations (UN) peace plan, and a cease-fire and settlement plan went into effect in 1991. Even though the UN Security Council created a [[peacekeeping]] force to implement a referendum on self-determination for Western Sahara, it has yet to be held, periodic negotiations have failed, and the status of the territory remains unresolved.<ref name=\"LOCprof\" />\n\nThe war against the Polisario guerrillas put severe strains on the economy, and Morocco found itself increasingly isolated diplomatically. Gradual political reforms in the 1990s culminated in the constitutional reform of 1996, which created a new bicameral legislature with expanded, although still limited, powers.
