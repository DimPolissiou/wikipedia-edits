It acquired a cosmopolitan and politically progressive feel, and was one of the first identifiable [[Homosexuality|gay and lesbian]] areas in urban South Africa.

It was a triangular shaped piece of waste land not used for farming and the future suburb lies in the northern apex of the triangle.

Many gay establishments and publications were founded in Hillbrow from the 1960s forward. The gay community was strong and large enough in Hillbrow that the conservative ruling [[National Party (South Africa)|National Party]], which instituted apartheid, fielded a pro-gay rights candidate, [[Leon de Beer]], in the 1987 elections. De Beer's victorious campaign was heavily advertised in the Hillbrow-based gay publication ''Exit'' and his campaign promises were to both advance gay rights in parliament and reinstate Hillbrow as a whites-only district. <ref name=\"IsinNyers2014\">{{cite book|author1=Engin F.

As the racial demographic in Hillbrow radically shifted, so too did the people in need of HIV-related care, and by the late 1990s the clinics mainly worked with black heterosexual women. Hillbrow experienced a heavy decline and most of the gay community, which was predominantly white, left the area within the decade.\n\n== In media and fiction ==\nIn 2000, [[Michael Hammon]] and Jacqueline G\u00f6rgen directed a documentary named ''Hillbrow Kids'', depicting the struggles of a group of street children in post-[[apartheid]] urban South Africa. The 2001 novel ''[[Welcome to Our Hillbrow]]'' by [[Phaswane Mpe]] deals with life in the district in the years after apartheid, focusing on a large number of issues ranging from poverty, [[HIV]]/[[AIDS]], and [[xenophobia]].  \n\nHillbrow has also been a setting used by other South African writers: in the 2001 novel, ''[[The Restless Supermarket]]'', [[Ivan Vladislavic]] comically portrays South Africa's transition to democracy, endowing his narrator, Aubrey Tearle, with the perspective of a conservative white pensioner.  Through this lens, Hillbrow becomes representative of the larger post-apartheid South African nation.\n\nIn 2007, [[BBC Two]] reporter [[Louis Theroux]] ran a documentary called \"[[Law and Disorder in Johannesburg]]\". The documentary depicted the state of complete abandon and lawlessness in some parts of the city, specifically in Hillbrow.\n\nMuch of [[Lauren Beukes]]' 2010 science fiction novel ''[[Zoo City]]'' was set in Hillbrow.\n\nIn January 2013, [[Al Jazeera English]] aired a [[Witness (2006 TV programme)|Witness]] documentary about Hillbrow described as \"A personal journey to Hillbrow, where human spirit, hope and enterprise triumph in this crime-ridden melting pot in the heart of South Africa.\"\n\n==The House Group==\nIn 1990 Jean du Plessis and Adele du Plessis founded [http://thehousegroup.org The House Group], an organization with several shelters and programs aimed at retrieving and rehabilitating female child victims of [[commercial sexual exploitation]]. The organization's first address in Hillbrow was on 52 Soper Road, close to [[Ponte City]]. In 1993 they moved to two adjacent premises on 60 Olivia Road (at the foot of the [[Hillbrow Tower]]) where the organization had The House Drop-in Centre and Intombi Shelter.\n \nAt the time, in South Africa, there was no legislation allowing The House Group to conduct its mission. Legislation was in effect to help male children, but no legislation allowed for girls in shelters. The lack of a legislative framework disallowed The House Group to continue and authorities tried to shut them down. The founders appealed to the media for help. A barrage of media attention followed that rallied public support and gained international attention. According to The House Group, hundreds of print articles and television exposes occurred over several years.\n\nDuring 1996, The House Group was invited to deliver papers to the [http://www.csecworldcongress.org/en/stockholm/Background/index.htm 1st World Congress Against Commercial Sexual Exploitation of Children], held in [[Stockholm]], Sweden. A hundred and fifty countries were represented at the meeting. The organization enjoyed goodwill and sponsorship from foreign governments, most notable the [[Dutch government|Royal Dutch Government]] and that of the USA. \n\nDuring 1997, the [[Gauteng|Gauteng Provincial Government]] proclaimed the first legislation that allowed shelters for female children. Jean du Plessis and Adele du Plessis had worked with the ministry over many years to that effect. Subsequent to 1996, hundreds of shelters and programs similar to The House Group sprouted in South Africa. The problem with children and youth victims of commercial sexual exploitation in South Africa, and Hillbrow in particular, is on the increase.\n\n== Landmarks ==\n=== Constitution Hill ===\nThe [[Constitution Hill, Johannesburg|Constitution Hill]] precinct, seat of the [[Constitutional Court of South Africa]], is located on the western edge of Hillbrow, and is part of a major [[government]] and [[private sector]] initiative to revitalize the area and the rest of the CBD.\n\n=== Hillbrow Tower ===\nThe [[Hillbrow Tower]], a [[telecommunication]] tower, dominates the Johannesburg city skyline, featured in many picture postcard views of the city. It has become a symbol of the city and appears in the city seal. Completed in 1971, it rises to a height of 270 metres, thus making it the tallest man-made structure with a lift in Africa. Initially named the [[JG Strijdom]] Tower, it became popularly known simply as the Hillbrow tower, and in May 2005 it was renamed to [[Telkom (South Africa)|Telkom]] Joburg Tower, with its new name displayed prominently in lights. It once featured a luxury rotating restaurant, but that was closed in 1981 due to security fears and is unlikely to be reopened.\n\n=== Ponte City ===\n[[Ponte City Apartments|Ponte City]] is the tallest residential building in Johannesburg and one of the city's most striking urban landmarks. It was designed by [[architect]] Rodney Grosskopff (who also designed other South African landmarks such as the [[Joburg Theatre|Johannesburg Civic Theatre]]) and completed in 1975.\n\nThe building is distinct due both to its height, rising to 54 storeys above one of the highest points in Johannesburg, as well as its cylindrical shape. During its prime, Ponte City was one of the city's most sought-after addresses, but with [[inner-city]] [[urban decay]] setting in, it has become run-down, over-populated, and unsafe. The building was placed under new [[Property management|management]] in 1999, and with regular maintenance reinstated and gradual restoration, coupled with council, provincial, and government initiatives to rehabilitate Hillbrow, it began to find some shine again.\n\nIn February 2007, [[Danny Boyle]], the British director of ''[[Trainspotting (film)|Trainspotting]]'', announced plans to use the building as a film set in a future release.<ref>[https://archive.today/20120914001556/http://industry.bfi.org.uk/10325 New Danny Boyle project Ponte Tower in first stage of

It was a triangular shaped piece of waste land not used for farming and the future suburb lies in the northern apex of the triangle.

Many gay establishments and publications were founded in Hillbrow from the 1960s forward. The gay community was strong and large enough in Hillbrow that the conservative ruling [[National Party (South Africa)|National Party]], which instituted apartheid, fielded a pro-gay rights candidate, [[Leon de Beer]], in the 1987 elections. De Beer's victorious campaign was heavily advertised in the Hillbrow-based gay publication ''Exit'' and his campaign promises were to both advance gay rights in parliament and reinstate Hillbrow as a whites-only district. <ref name=\"IsinNyers2014\">{{cite book|author1=Engin F.

As the racial demographic in Hillbrow radically shifted, so too did the people in need of HIV-related care, and by the late 1990s the clinics mainly worked with black heterosexual women. Hillbrow experienced a heavy decline and most of the gay community, which was predominantly white, left the area within the decade.\n\n== In media and fiction ==\nIn 2000, [[Michael Hammon]] and Jacqueline G\u00f6rgen directed a documentary named ''Hillbrow Kids'', depicting the struggles of a group of street children in post-[[apartheid]] urban South Africa. The 2001 novel ''[[Welcome to Our Hillbrow]]'' by [[Phaswane Mpe]] deals with life in the district in the years after apartheid, focusing on a large number of issues ranging from poverty, [[HIV]]/[[AIDS]], and [[xenophobia]].  \n\nHillbrow has also been a setting used by other South African writers: in the 2001 novel, ''[[The Restless Supermarket]]'', [[Ivan Vladislavic]] comically portrays South Africa's transition to democracy, endowing his narrator, Aubrey Tearle, with the perspective of a conservative white pensioner.  Through this lens, Hillbrow becomes representative of the larger post-apartheid South African nation.\n\nIn 2007, [[BBC Two]] reporter [[Louis Theroux]] ran a documentary called \"[[Law and Disorder in Johannesburg]]\". The documentary depicted the state of complete abandon and lawlessness in some parts of the city, specifically in Hillbrow.\n\nMuch of [[Lauren Beukes]]' 2010 science fiction novel ''[[Zoo City]]'' was set in Hillbrow.\n\nIn January 2013, [[Al Jazeera English]] aired a [[Witness (2006 TV programme)|Witness]] documentary about Hillbrow described as \"A personal journey to Hillbrow, where human spirit, hope and enterprise triumph in this crime-ridden melting pot in the heart of South Africa.\"\n\n==The House Group==\nIn 1990 Jean du Plessis and Adele du Plessis founded [http://thehousegroup.org The House Group], an organization with several shelters and programs aimed at retrieving and rehabilitating female child victims of [[commercial sexual exploitation]]. The organization\u2019s first address in Hillbrow was on 52 Soper Road, close to [[Ponte City]]. In 1993 they moved to two adjacent premises on 60 Olivia Road (at the foot of the [[Hillbrow Tower]]) where the organization had The House Drop-in Centre and Intombi Shelter.\n \nAt the time, in South Africa, there was no legislation allowing The House Group to conduct its mission. Legislation was in effect to help male children, but no legislation allowed for girls in shelters. The lack of a legislative framework disallowed The House Group to continue and authorities tried to shut them down. The founders appealed to the media for help. A barrage of media attention followed that rallied public support and gained international attention. According to The House Group, hundreds of print articles and television exposes occurred over several years.\n\nDuring 1996, The House Group was invited to deliver papers to the [http://www.csecworldcongress.org/en/stockholm/Background/index.htm 1st World Congress Against Commercial Sexual Exploitation of Children], held in [[Stockholm]], Sweden. A hundred and fifty countries were represented at the meeting. The organization enjoyed goodwill and sponsorship from foreign governments, most notable the [[Dutch government|Royal Dutch Government]] and that of the USA. \n\nDuring 1997, the [[Gauteng|Gauteng Provincial Government]] proclaimed the first legislation that allowed shelters for female children. Jean du Plessis and Adele du Plessis had worked with the ministry over many years to that effect. Subsequent to 1996, hundreds of shelters and programs similar to The House Group sprouted in South Africa. The problem with children and youth victims of commercial sexual exploitation in South Africa, and Hillbrow in particular, is on the increase.\n\n== Landmarks ==\n=== Constitution Hill ===\nThe [[Constitution Hill, Johannesburg|Constitution Hill]] precinct, seat of the [[Constitutional Court of South Africa]], is located on the western edge of Hillbrow, and is part of a major [[government]] and [[private sector]] initiative to revitalize the area and the rest of the CBD.\n\n=== Hillbrow Tower ===\nThe [[Hillbrow Tower]], a [[telecommunication]] tower, dominates the Johannesburg city skyline, featured in many picture postcard views of the city. It has become a symbol of the city and appears in the city seal. Completed in 1971, it rises to a height of 270 metres, thus making it the tallest man-made structure with a lift in Africa. Initially named the [[JG Strijdom]] Tower, it became popularly known simply as the Hillbrow tower, and in May 2005 it was renamed to [[Telkom (South Africa)|Telkom]] Joburg Tower, with its new name displayed prominently in lights. It once featured a luxury rotating restaurant, but that was closed in 1981 due to security fears and is unlikely to be reopened.\n\n=== Ponte City ===\n[[Ponte City Apartments|Ponte City]] is the tallest residential building in Johannesburg and one of the city's most striking urban landmarks. It was designed by [[architect]] Rodney Grosskopff (who also designed other South African landmarks such as the [[Joburg Theatre|Johannesburg Civic Theatre]]) and completed in 1975.\n\nThe building is distinct due both to its height, rising to 54 storeys above one of the highest points in Johannesburg, as well as its cylindrical shape. During its prime, Ponte City was one of the city's most sought-after addresses, but with [[inner-city]] [[urban decay]] setting in, it has become run-down, over-populated, and unsafe. The building was placed under new [[Property management|management]] in 1999, and with regular maintenance reinstated and gradual restoration, coupled with council, provincial, and government initiatives to rehabilitate Hillbrow, it began to find some shine again.\n\nIn February 2007, [[Danny Boyle]], the British director of ''[[Trainspotting (film)|Trainspotting]]'', announced plans to use the building as a film set in a future release.<ref>[https://archive.today/20120914001556/http://industry.bfi.org.uk/10325 New Danny Boyle project Ponte Tower in first stage of development]</ref>\n\n== Books and publications ==\n* Daniel Conway (2009) 'Queering Apartheid: the National Party's 1987 'Gay Rights' Election Campaign in Hillbrow', Journal of Southern African Studies, 35,4: 849\u2013863.\n* Glynn Griffiths and Paddy Clay, ''Hillbrow'' (Cape Town, Don Nelson, 1982)\n* Kgebetli Moele, ''Room 207'' (Kwela Books, 2006)\n* Alan Morris, ''Bleakness and Light: Inner City Transition in Hillbrow, Johannesburg'' (Johannesburg, University of Witwatersrand Press, 1999)\n* [[Phaswane Mpe]], ''[[Welcome to Our Hillbrow]]'' (Pietermaritzburg, University of KwaZulu-Natal Press, 2001)\n* [[Ivan Vladislavic]], ''[[The Restless Supermarket]]'' (Cape Town, David Philip, 2001)\n\n== Music ==\n* ''Hillbrow'' by [[Johannes Kerkorrel]], from the album ''[[Eet Kreef]]'' (Shifty Records, 1989).\n* ''Hillbrow'' by [[Stef Bos]], from the album ''Jy vir My''.\n* ''Hillbrow'' by [[Manfred Mann's Earth Band]], from the CD box ''[[Odds & Sods \u2013 Mis-takes & Out-takes]]''\n\n==See also==\n*''[[Jerusalema]]'' \u2013 2008 South African film portraying life in Hillbrow\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commons category|Hillbrow}}\n* [http://www.southafrica.info/plan_trip/holiday/cities/hillbrowtower.htm Hillbrow Tower]\n* [http://www.thehousegroup.org www.thehousegroup.org]\n\n{{City of Johannesburg Metropolitan Municipality|selected=regf}}\n\n[[Category:Johannesburg Region F|Hillbrow]]\n[[Category:Urban decay in South Africa]]\n[[Category:Red-light districts in South Africa]]\n", "name_user": "Iridescent", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eThe House Group:Cleanup andtypo fixing,typo(s) fixed: \u2019s \u2192 's", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hillbrow"}

The film follows a teenage girl who is given a magic box that grants wishes, but kills someone close to her each time it does.\n\nThe film was theatrically released on July 14, 2017, by [[Broad Green Pictures]] and [[Orion Pictures]]. It received negative reviews from critics<ref name=opening/> and has grossed $23.5 million worldwide.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://comingsoon.net/movie/wish-upon-2017|title=Wish Upon|accessdate=February 7, 2017}}</ref>\n\n== Plot ==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for feature films should be between 400 and 700 words. -->\nClare Shannon, a 17-year-old high school student who is not part of the popular crowd, is haunted by the memory of her mother's suicide by hanging, which she witnessed as a young child. Her father, Jonathan, a former musician and compulsive hoarder who [[Dumpster diver|dumpster dives]] as a hobby, finds a Chinese [[music box]] and gives it to her as an early birthday gift. Clare deciphers one of the numerous inscriptions on the box as \"Seven Wishes,\" and absentmindedly wishes for Darcie, her tormentor and school bully, to \"rot,\" at which point Darcie develops [[necrotizing fasciitis]] and is admitted into the ICU. That same day, Clare's dog Max dies in her house's crawlspace after seemingly being eaten alive by rats. Clare realizes that the box grants wishes, but does not understand that her wishes come with consequences.\n\nClare makes a second wish that a popular boy named Paul falls in love with her. As a result, her wealthy uncle dies. Upon hearing the news of his death, Clare then wishes she will be in the will. The relative leaves everything to Clare. Consequently Mrs. Deluca, a friendly neighbor, suffers a fatal accident. Clare enlists the help of her classmate Ryan Hui to decipher the symbols. Ryan's cousin Gina helps Clare decipher the meaning of the symbols saying that each of the seven wishes upon wished, comes with consequences and that the rules have to be followed. Clare's fourth wish is for her father to stop being a dumpster diver and he immediately has a personality shift. Soon after, Gina deciphers the meaning of the phrase which says \"When the music ends, the blood price is paid.\" After she warns Ryan, she dies. Ryan finds Gina's body and confronts Clare about making wishes on the music box, which she denies.\n\nClare makes a fifth wish that she is popular, but Clare is soon unhappy with the consequent attention and that she loses her relationship with her friends. As a consequence of the wish, Meredith gets stuck in an elevator and, when the cable snaps, falls to her death.\n\nRyan reveals that after the seventh wish is granted, the music box will claim the soul of the owner. Attempts to destroy the box are unsuccessful. Furthermore, because June, a friend, has stolen the box, Clare loses her popularity and everything else she wished for. Clare recovers the box but June is injured after falling down a staircase. Nevertheless, Clare's sixth wish is that her mother never committed suicide. Clare's mom knocks on her bedroom door along with two younger sisters. Clare later rummages through her mom's paintings and sees a picture of the music box. She concludes that her mom was one of the previous owners of the music box and that it must have led to her original suicide.\n\nWhen Clare realizes her dad pays the price for the sixth wish, Clare's seventh wish is to go back to the day her father found the box, erasing all that has happened. This allows her to find the box before her dad does, she then asks Ryan to bury the box. Clare believes all is well but she is killed when her bully Darcie accidentally hits her with her car, in order to pay the final blood price. The music box can be heard after Clare's death, indicating that the seventh wish to reverse time would be balanced by her own death.\n\nIn a mid-credits scene, Ryan prepares to bury the music box but becomes intrigued by the inscription about the seven wishes and decides against burying the box, hence starting the vicious cycle that Clare went through, again.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Joey King]] as Clare Shannon, a high schooler who discovers a Chinese music box that grants her seven wishes.\n** Raegan Revord as young Clare\n* [[Josephine Langford]] as Darcie Chapman, one of Clare's classmates who regularly bullies her.\n* [[Ryan Phillippe]] as Jonathan Shannon, Clare's father and a dumpster diver.\n* [[Ki Hong Lee]] as Ryan Hui, one of Clare's classmates who helps her investigate the music box.\n* [[Sydney Park (actress)|Sydney Park]] as Meredith McNeil, one of Clare's close friends.\n* [[Shannon Purser]] as June Acosta, one of Clare's close friends.\n* [[Sherilyn Fenn]] as Mrs. Deluca, the Shannons' neighbor and friend.\n* [[Elisabeth R\u00f6hm]] as Johanna Shannon, Clare's deceased mother.\n* [[Mitchell Slaggert]] as Paul Middlebrook, Clare's classmate whom she is attracted to.\n* [[Alice Lee (actress)|Alice Lee]] as Gina Hsu, Ryan's cousin who helps decipher the text on the music box.\n* Victor Sutton as August Shannon, Clare's wealthy uncle.\n* [[Kevin Hanchard]] as Carl Morris, Jonathan's friend.\n* [[Jerry O'Connell]] as Lawrence Hart, a previous owner of the music box. O'Connell was not credited for the role.\n\n== Themes ==\nDirector John R.

The film follows a teenage girl who is given a magic box that grants wishes, but kills someone close to her each time it does.\n\nThe film was theatrically released on July 14, 2017, by [[Broad Green Pictures]] and [[Orion Pictures]]. It received negative reviews from critics<ref name=opening/> and has grossed $23.5 million worldwide.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://comingsoon.net/movie/wish-upon-2017|title=Wish Upon|accessdate=February 7, 2017}}</ref>\n\n== Plot ==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for feature films should be between 400 and 700 words. -->\nClare Shannon, a 17-year-old high school student who is not part of the popular crowd, is haunted by the memory of her mother's suicide by hanging, which she witnessed as a young child. Her father, Jonathan, a former musician and compulsive hoarder who [[Dumpster diver|dumpster dives]] as a hobby, finds a Chinese [[music box]] and gives it to her as an early birthday gift. Clare deciphers one of the numerous inscriptions on the box as \"Seven Wishes,\" and absentmindedly wishes for Darcie, her tormentor and school bully, to \"rot,\" at which point Darcie develops [[necrotizing fasciitis]] and is admitted into the ICU. That same day, Clare's dog Max dies in her house's crawlspace after seemingly being eaten alive by rats. Clare realizes that the box grants wishes, but does not understand that her wishes come with consequences.\n\nClare makes a second wish that a popular boy named Paul falls in love with her. As a result, her wealthy uncle dies. Upon hearing the news of his death, Clare then wishes she will be in the will. The relative leaves everything to Clare. Consequently Mrs. Deluca, a friendly neighbor, suffers a fatal accident. Clare enlists the help of her classmate Ryan Hui to decipher the symbols. Ryan's cousin Gina helps Clare decipher the meaning of the symbols saying that each of the seven wishes upon wished, comes with consequences and that the rules have to be followed. Clare's fourth wish is for her father to stop being a dumpster diver and he immediately has a personality shift. Soon after, Gina deciphers the meaning of the phrase which says \"When the music ends, the blood price is paid.\" After she warns Ryan, she dies. Ryan finds Gina's body and confronts Clare about making wishes on the music box, which she denies.\n\nClare makes a fifth wish that she is popular, but Clare is soon unhappy with the consequent attention and that she loses her relationship with her friends. As a consequence of the wish, Meredith gets stuck in an elevator and, when the cable snaps, falls to her death.\n\nRyan reveals that after the seventh wish is granted, the music box will claim the soul of the owner. Attempts to destroy the box are unsuccessful. Furthermore, because June, a friend, has stolen the box, Clare loses her popularity and everything else she wished for. Clare recovers the box but June is injured after falling down a staircase. Nevertheless, Clare's sixth wish is that her mother never committed suicide. Clare's mom knocks on her bedroom door along with two younger sisters. Clare later rummages through her mom's paintings and sees a picture of the music box. She concludes that her mom was one of the previous owners of the music box and that it must have led to her original suicide.\n\nWhen Clare realizes her dad pays the price for the sixth wish, Clare's seventh wish is to go back to the day her father found the box, erasing all that has happened. This allows her to find the box before her dad does, she then asks Ryan to bury the box. Clare believes all is well but she is killed when her bully Darcie accidentally hits her with her car, in order to pay the final blood price. The music box can be heard after Clare's death, indicating that the seventh wish to reverse time would be balanced by her own death.\n\nIn a mid-credits scene, Ryan prepares to bury the music box but becomes intrigued by the inscription about the seven wishes and decides against burying the box, hence starting the vicious cycle that Clare went through, again.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Joey King]] as Clare Shannon, a high schooler who discovers a Chinese music box that grants her seven wishes.\n** [[Raegan Revord]] as young Clare\n* [[Josephine Langford]] as Darcie Chapman, one of Clare's classmates who regularly bullies her.\n* [[Ryan Phillippe]] as Jonathan Shannon, Clare's father and a dumpster diver.\n* [[Ki Hong Lee]] as Ryan Hui, one of Clare's classmates who helps her investigate the music box.\n* [[Sydney Park (actress)|Sydney Park]] as Meredith McNeil, one of Clare's close friends.\n* [[Shannon Purser]] as June Acosta, one of Clare's close friends.\n* [[Sherilyn Fenn]] as Mrs. Deluca, the Shannons' neighbor and friend.\n* [[Elisabeth R\u00f6hm]] as Johanna Shannon, Clare's deceased mother.\n* [[Mitchell Slaggert]] as Paul Middlebrook, Clare's classmate whom she is attracted to.\n* [[Alice Lee (actress)|Alice Lee]] as Gina Hsu, Ryan's cousin who helps decipher the text on the music box.\n* Victor Sutton as August Shannon, Clare's wealthy uncle.\n* [[Kevin Hanchard]] as Carl Morris, Jonathan's friend.\n* [[Jerry O'Connell]] as Lawrence Hart, a previous owner of the music box. O'Connell was not credited for the role.\n\n== Themes ==\nDirector John R.

Television]] and [[Chuck Lorre Productions]]. ''The Big Bang Theory'' received mixed reviews from critics throughout its first season, but reception was more favorable in the second and third seasons. Later seasons saw a return to a lukewarm reception, with the show being criticized for a decline in comedic quality. Despite the mixed reviews, seven seasons of the show have ranked within the top ten of the final television season ratings, ultimately reaching the no. 1 spot in its eleventh season. The show was nominated for the [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Comedy Series|Emmy Award for Outstanding Comedy Series]] from 2011 to 2014 and won the [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Comedy Series|Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Comedy Series]] four times for [[Jim Parsons]]. In total, it won seven Emmy Awards from 46 nominations. Parsons also won the Golden Globe for [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actor \u2013 Television Series Musical or Comedy|Best Actor in a Television Comedy Series]] in 2011. The series also spawned a prequel series in 2017 based on Parsons' character, Sheldon Cooper, named ''[[Young Sheldon]]'', which also airs on CBS.\n{{TOClimit|3}}\n\n==Production==\n[[File:The Big Bang Theory Logo.png|thumb|Series' logo used for print]]\nThe show's pilot episode premiered on September 24, 2007.

The structure of the original unaired pilot was substantially different from the series' current form. The only main characters retained in both pilots were Leonard ([[Johnny Galecki]]) and Sheldon ([[Jim Parsons]]), who are named after [[Sheldon Leonard]], a longtime figure in episodic television as producer, director and actor. A minor character, Althea ([[Vernee Watson]]), appeared in the first scene of both pilots that was retained generally as-is.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chucklorre.com/index-bbt.php?p=187|title=CLP&nbsp;\u2013 Vanity Card #187|first=Chuck|last=Lorre|publisher=Chuck Lorre Productions|date=October 15, 2007|accessdate=June 7, 2012}}</ref> The first pilot included two female lead characters - Katie, \"a street-hardened, tough-as-nails woman with a vulnerable interior\" (played by Canadian actress [[Amanda Walsh]])<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thefutoncritic.com/news.aspx?date=05/26/06&id=7165|title=Breaking News&nbsp;\u2013 Development Update: May 22\u201326 (Weekly Round-Up)|publisher=TheFutonCritic.com|accessdate=May 2, 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://weblogs.variety.com/season_pass/2009/05/big-bang-theory-we-didnt-anticipate-how-protective-the-audience-would-feel-toward-our-guys.html|title='Big Bang Theory': 'We didn't anticipate how protective the audience would feel about our guys'|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=May 8, 2009|accessdate=January 15, 2010}}</ref> and Gilda, a scientist colleague and friend of the male characters (played by [[Iris Bahr]]).

The original pilot used [[Thomas Dolby]]'s hit \"[[She Blinded Me with Science]]\" as its theme song.\n\nAlthough the original pilot was not picked up, its creators were given an opportunity to retool it and produce a second pilot. They brought in the remaining cast and retooled the show to its final format. Katie was replaced by Penny ([[Kaley Cuoco]]). The original unaired pilot has never been officially released, but it has circulated on the Internet.{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}} On the evolution of the show, [[Chuck Lorre]] said, \"We did the 'Big Bang Pilot' about two and a half years ago, and it sucked ... but there were two remarkable things that worked perfectly, and that was Johnny and Jim.

Leonard becomes attracted to Penny in the pilot episode and his need to do favors for her is a frequent point of humor in the first season. Meanwhile, Penny dates a series of muscular, attractive, unintelligent, and insensitive jocks. Their first long-term relationship begins when Leonard returns from a three-month expedition to the [[North Pole]] in the season 3 premiere. However, when Leonard tells Penny that he loves her, she realizes she cannot say it back. Both Leonard and Penny go on to date other people; most notably with Leonard dating Raj's sister Priya for much of season 4. This relationship is jeopardized when Leonard comes to falsely believe that Raj has slept with Penny, and ultimately ends when Priya sleeps with a former boyfriend in \"[[The Good Guy Fluctuation]]\".\n\nPenny, who admits to missing Leonard in \"[[The Roommate Transmogrification]]\", accepts his request to renew their relationship in \"[[The Beta Test Initiation]]\". After Penny suggests having sex in \"The Launch Acceleration\", Leonard breaks the mood by proposing to her. Penny says \"no\" but does not break up with him. She stops a proposal a second time in \"The Tangible Affection Proof\". In the sixth-season episode, \"The 43 Peculiarity\", Penny finally tells Leonard that she loves him. Although they both feel jealousy when the other receives significant attention from the opposite sex, Penny is secure enough in their relationship to send him off on an exciting four-month expedition without worrying in \"The Bon Voyage Reaction\". After Leonard returns, their relationship blossoms over the seventh season. In the penultimate episode \"The Gorilla Dissolution\", Penny admits that they should marry and when Leonard realizes that she is serious, he proposes with a ring that he had been saving for years. Leonard and Penny decide to elope to Las Vegas in the season 8 finale, but beforehand, wanting no secrets, Leonard admits to kissing another woman, Mandy Chow ([[Melissa Tang]]) while on an expedition on the [[North Sea]]. Despite this, Leonard and Penny finally elope in the season 9 premiere.\n\n===Sheldon and Amy's relationship===\nIn the third-season finale, Raj and Howard sign Sheldon up for online dating to find a woman compatible with Sheldon and discover [[Neuroscientist|neurobiologist]] Amy Farrah Fowler. Like him, she has a history of social ineptitude and participates in online dating only to fulfill an agreement with her mother. This spawns a storyline in which Sheldon and Amy communicate daily while insisting to Leonard and Penny that they are not romantically involved. In \"The Agreement Dissection\", Sheldon and Amy talk in her apartment after a night of dancing and she kisses him on the lips. Instead of getting annoyed, Sheldon says \"fascinating\" and later asks Amy to be his girlfriend in \"The Flaming Spittoon Acquisition\". The same night he draws up \"The Relationship Agreement\" to verify the ground rules of him as her boyfriend and vice versa (similar to his \"Roommate Agreement\" with Leonard). Amy agrees but later regrets not having had a lawyer read through it.\n\nIn \"The Launch Acceleration\", Amy tries to use her \"neurobiology bag of tricks\" to increase the attraction between herself and Sheldon. Her efforts appear to be working as Sheldon is not happy but makes no attempt to stop her. In the final fifth-season episode \"The Countdown Reflection\", Sheldon takes Amy's hand as Howard is launched into space. In the sixth season first episode \"The Date Night Variable\", after a dinner in which Sheldon fails to live up to this expectation, Amy gives Sheldon an ultimatum that their relationship is over unless he tells her something from his heart. Amy accepts Sheldon's romantic speech even after learning that it is a line from the first Spider-Man movie. In \"The Cooper/Kripke Inversion\" Sheldon states that he has been working on his discomfort about physical contact and admits that \"it's a possibility\" that he could one day have sex with Amy. Amy is revealed to have similar feelings in \"The Love Spell Potential\". Sheldon explains that he never thought about intimacy with anyone before Amy.<ref>The Big Bang Theory, Episode 6/23, \"The Love Spell Potential.</ref>\n\n\"The Locomotive Manipulation\" is the first episode in which Sheldon initiates a kiss with Amy. Although initially done in a fit of sarcasm, he discovers that he enjoys the feeling. Consequently, Sheldon slowly starts to open up over the rest of the season, and starts a more intimate relationship with Amy. However, in the season finale, Sheldon leaves temporarily to cope with several changes and Amy becomes distraught. However, 45 days into the trip, Sheldon gets mugged and calls for Leonard to drive him home, only to be confronted by Amy, who is upset over not being contacted by him in weeks. When Sheldon admits he did not call her because he was too embarrassed to admit that he could not make it on his own; Amy accepts that he is not perfect. In \"The Prom Equivalency\", Sheldon hides in his room to avoid going to a mock prom reenactment with her. In the resulting stand-off, Amy is about to confess that she loves Sheldon, but he surprises her by saying that he loves her too. This prompts Amy to have a panic attack.\n\nIn the season eight finale, Sheldon and Amy get into a fight about commitment on their fifth anniversary. Amy tells Sheldon that she needs to think about the future of their relationship, unaware that Sheldon was about to propose to her. Season nine sees Sheldon harassing Amy about making up her mind until she breaks up with him. Both struggle with singlehood and trying to be friends for the next few weeks until they reunite in episode ten and have sex for the first time on Amy's birthday. In season ten, Amy's apartment is flooded, and she and Sheldon decide to move in together into Penny's apartment as part of a five-week experiment to determine compatibility with each other's living habits. It goes well and they decide to make the arrangement permanent.\n\nIn the season eleven premiere, Sheldon proposes to Amy and she accepts. The two get married in the eleventh-season finale.\n\n===Soft Kitty===\n{{main|Soft Kitty}}\nIn the show, the song \"Soft Kitty\" was described by Sheldon as a song sung by his mother when he was ill.

She is dependent on Howard, as she requires him to help her with her wig and makeup in the morning.

Stairway conversations between characters occur in almost every episode, often serving as a transition between longer scenes. The Season 3 episode, \"The Staircase Implementation\" reveals that the elevator was broken when Leonard was experimenting with rocket fuel.<ref>{{Citation|title=The Staircase Implementation|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1648756/|access-date=March 8, 2019}}</ref> In the penultimate episode of the series, the elevator is returned to an operational state, causing Sheldon some angst.\n\n===Vanity cards===\nLike most shows created by Chuck Lorre, ''The Big Bang Theory'' ends by showing for one second a [[vanity card]] written by Lorre after the credits, followed by the Warner Bros.

The show was also shown as a 'first-look' on Channel 4's digital offshoot [[E4 (TV channel)|E4]] prior to the main channel's airing. While the show's ratings were not deemed strong enough for the main channel, they were considered the opposite for E4. For each following season, all episodes were shown first-run on E4, with episodes only aired on the main channel in a repeat capacity, usually on a weekend morning. From the third season, the show aired in two parts, being split so that it could air new episodes for longer throughout the year. This was due to rising ratings. The first part began airing on December 17, 2009, at 9:00&nbsp;p.m. while the second part, containing the remaining eleven episodes, began airing in the same time period from May 6, 2010. The first half of the fourth season began airing on November 4, 2010, at 9:00&nbsp;p.m., drawing 877,000 viewers, with a further 256,000 watching on the E4+1 hour service. This gave the show an overall total of 1.13 million viewers, making it E4's most-watched programme for that week. The increased ratings continued over subsequent weeks.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.barb.co.uk/viewing/weekly-top-10|title=Weekly Top 10 Programmes|publisher=Barb.co.uk|date=July 17, 2011|accessdate=July 28, 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121214014705/http://www.barb.co.uk/viewing/weekly-top-10|archivedate=December 14, 2012}}</ref>\n\nThe fourth season's second half began on June 30, 2011.

''The Big Bang Theory'' received mixed reviews from critics throughout its first season, but reception was more favorable in the second and third seasons.

Despite the mixed reviews, seven seasons of the show have ranked within the top ten of the final television season ratings, ultimately reaching the no. 1 spot in its eleventh season.

Leonard becomes attracted to Penny in the pilot episode and his need to do favors for her is a frequent point of humor in the first season. Meanwhile, Penny dates a series of muscular, attractive, unintelligent, and insensitive jocks. Their first long-term relationship begins when Leonard returns from a three-month expedition to the [[North Pole]] in the season 3 premiere. However, when Leonard tells Penny that he loves her, she realizes she cannot say it back. Both Leonard and Penny go on to date other people; most notably with Leonard dating Raj's sister Priya for much of season 4. This relationship is jeopardized when Leonard comes to falsely believe that Raj has slept with Penny, and ultimately ends when Priya sleeps with a former boyfriend in \"[[The Good Guy Fluctuation]]\".\n\nPenny, who admits to missing Leonard in \"[[The Roommate Transmogrification]]\", accepts his request to renew their relationship in \"[[The Beta Test Initiation]]\". After Penny suggests having sex in \"The Launch Acceleration\", Leonard breaks the mood by proposing to her. Penny says \"no\" but does not break up with him. She stops a proposal a second time in \"The Tangible Affection Proof\". In the sixth-season episode, \"The 43 Peculiarity\", Penny finally tells Leonard that she loves him. Although they both feel jealousy when the other receives significant attention from the opposite sex, Penny is secure enough in their relationship to send him off on an exciting four-month expedition without worrying in \"The Bon Voyage Reaction\". After Leonard returns, their relationship blossoms over the seventh season. In the penultimate episode \"The Gorilla Dissolution\", Penny admits that they should marry and when Leonard realizes that she is serious, he proposes with a ring that he had been saving for years. Leonard and Penny decide to elope to Las Vegas in the season 8 finale, but beforehand, wanting no secrets, Leonard admits to kissing another woman, Mandy Chow ([[Melissa Tang]]) while on an expedition on the [[North Sea]]. Despite this, Leonard and Penny finally elope in the season 9 premiere.\n\n===Sheldon and Amy's relationship===\nIn the third-season finale, Raj and Howard sign Sheldon up for online dating to find a woman compatible with Sheldon and discover [[Neuroscientist|neurobiologist]] Amy Farrah Fowler. Like him, she has a history of social ineptitude and participates in online dating only to fulfill an agreement with her mother. This spawns a storyline in which Sheldon and Amy communicate daily while insisting to Leonard and Penny that they are not romantically involved. In \"The Agreement Dissection\", Sheldon and Amy talk in her apartment after a night of dancing and she kisses him on the lips. Instead of getting annoyed, Sheldon says \"fascinating\" and later asks Amy to be his girlfriend in \"The Flaming Spittoon Acquisition\". The same night he draws up \"The Relationship Agreement\" to verify the ground rules of him as her boyfriend and vice versa (similar to his \"Roommate Agreement\" with Leonard). Amy agrees but later regrets not having had a lawyer read through it.\n\nIn \"The Launch Acceleration\", Amy tries to use her \"neurobiology bag of tricks\" to increase the attraction between herself and Sheldon. Her efforts appear to be working as Sheldon is not happy but makes no attempt to stop her. In the final fifth-season episode \"The Countdown Reflection\", Sheldon takes Amy's hand as Howard is launched into space. In the sixth season first episode \"The Date Night Variable\", after a dinner in which Sheldon fails to live up to this expectation, Amy gives Sheldon an ultimatum that their relationship is over unless he tells her something from his heart. Amy accepts Sheldon's romantic speech even after learning that it is a line from the first Spider-Man movie. In \"The Cooper/Kripke Inversion\" Sheldon states that he has been working on his discomfort about physical contact and admits that \"it's a possibility\" that he could one day have sex with Amy. Amy is revealed to have similar feelings in \"The Love Spell Potential\". Sheldon explains that he never thought about intimacy with anyone before Amy.<ref>The Big Bang Theory, Episode 6/23, \"The Love Spell Potential.</ref>\n\n\"The Locomotive Manipulation\" is the first episode in which Sheldon initiates a kiss with Amy. Although initially done in a fit of sarcasm, he discovers that he enjoys the feeling. Consequently, Sheldon slowly starts to open up over the rest of the season, and starts a more intimate relationship with Amy. However, in the season finale, Sheldon leaves temporarily to cope with several changes and Amy becomes distraught. However, 45 days into the trip, Sheldon gets mugged and calls for Leonard to drive him home, only to be confronted by Amy, who is upset over not being contacted by him in weeks. When Sheldon admits he did not call her because he was too embarrassed to admit that he could not make it on his own; Amy accepts that he is not perfect. In \"The Prom Equivalency\", Sheldon hides in his room to avoid going to a mock prom reenactment with her. In the resulting stand-off, Amy is about to confess that she loves Sheldon, but he surprises her by saying that he loves her too. This prompts Amy to have a panic attack.\n\nIn the season eight finale, Sheldon and Amy get into a fight about commitment on their fifth anniversary. Amy tells Sheldon that she needs to think about the future of their relationship, unaware that Sheldon was about to propose to her. Season nine sees Sheldon harassing Amy about making up her mind until she breaks up with him. Both struggle with singlehood and trying to be friends for the next few weeks until they reunite in episode ten and have sex for the first time on Amy's birthday. In season ten, Amy's apartment is flooded, and she and Sheldon decide to move in together into Penny's apartment as part of a five-week experiment to determine compatibility with each other's living habits. It goes well and they decide to make the arrangement permanent.\n\nIn the season eleven premiere, Sheldon proposes to Amy and she accepts. The two get married in the eleventh-season finale.\n\n===Soft Kitty===\n{{main|Soft Kitty}}\nIn the show, the song \"Soft Kitty\" was described by Sheldon as a song sung by his mother when he was ill.

She is dependent on Howard, as she requires him to help her with her wig and makeup in the morning.

Stairway conversations between characters occur in almost every episode, often serving as a transition between longer scenes. The Season 3 episode, \"The Staircase Implementation\" reveals that the elevator was broken when Leonard was experimenting with rocket fuel.<ref>{{Citation|title=The Staircase Implementation|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1648756/|access-date=March 8, 2019}}</ref> In the penultimate episode of the series, the elevator is returned to an operational state, causing Sheldon some angst.\n\n===Vanity cards===\nLike most shows created by Chuck Lorre, ''The Big Bang Theory'' ends by showing for one second a [[vanity card]] written by Lorre after the credits, followed by the Warner Bros.

The show was also shown as a 'first-look' on Channel 4's digital offshoot [[E4 (TV channel)|E4]] prior to the main channel's airing. While the show's ratings were not deemed strong enough for the main channel, they were considered the opposite for E4. For each following season, all episodes were shown first-run on E4, with episodes only aired on the main channel in a repeat capacity, usually on a weekend morning. From the third season, the show aired in two parts, being split so that it could air new episodes for longer throughout the year. This was due to rising ratings. The first part began airing on December 17, 2009, at 9:00&nbsp;p.m. while the second part, containing the remaining eleven episodes, began airing in the same time period from May 6, 2010. The first half of the fourth season began airing on November 4, 2010, at 9:00&nbsp;p.m., drawing 877,000 viewers, with a further 256,000 watching on the E4+1 hour service. This gave the show an overall total of 1.13 million viewers, making it E4's most-watched programme for that week. The increased ratings continued over subsequent weeks.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.barb.co.uk/viewing/weekly-top-10|title=Weekly Top 10 Programmes|publisher=Barb.co.uk|date=July 17, 2011|accessdate=July 28, 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121214014705/http://www.barb.co.uk/viewing/weekly-top-10|archivedate=December 14, 2012}}</ref>\n\nThe fourth season's second half began on June 30, 2011.

Originally from [[New Jersey]], he received his PhD at age 24, spending at least some of his time at [[Princeton University]]. He shared an apartment in [[Pasadena, California|Pasadena]] with colleague and friend Dr. Sheldon Cooper until season 9. Unlike his equally geeky friends, Leonard is interested and adept in building relationships with other people. Compared to his friends, he is relatively successful with women.\n\nThe writers have toyed with a romance between him and next-door neighbor Penny since the series premiere, with their unresolved sexual tension being a major force for drama. Leonard dated Penny for most of season three. Following his break-up with Penny, Leonard began a relationship with Raj's sister Priya in season four. The two attempted a long-distance relationship after Priya moved back to [[India]], but Leonard broke up with her in season five after she admitted to cheating on him. In season five's \"The Recombination Hypothesis\", Leonard and Penny start dating again.\n\nIn season six's \"The 43 Peculiarity\", Penny tells him she loves him for the first time. Over the next two years, they talk about marriage and each have unsuccessful proposals until the penultimate episode of season seven, when they become engaged. They get married in the ninth-season premiere, followed by a wedding redo for their friends and families since the couple had eloped. In the series finale \"The Stockholm Syndrome\", it is revealed that they are expecting their first child.\n\nLeonard's family includes other accomplished scientists: his mother, Dr. Beverly Hofstadter, is a [[neuroscientist]] and world-renowned [[psychiatrist]], his sister is a [[medical research]]er, and his father, Dr. Alfred Hofstadter, is an [[anthropologist]]. Also, his brother Michael is a Harvard law professor.\n\n==== Sheldon ====\n{{main|Sheldon Cooper}}\n[[File:Jim Parsons at PaleyFest 2013.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Jim Parsons]]]]\n\nSheldon Lee Cooper ([[Jim Parsons]]) is a [[Theoretical physics|theoretical physicist]], possessing a [[Bachelor of Science|BS]], [[Master of Science|MS]], [[Doctor of Philosophy|PhD]], [[Doctor of Science|Sc.D.]], and an [[Intelligence quotient|IQ]] of 187. Born in [[East Texas]], he was a [[child prodigy]], and received his PhD at age 16 from [[California Institute of Technology|Caltech]]. He is often cold, self-centered, condescending, and immature, but is not intentionally hurtful: his conduct is generally well-intentioned, but poorly judged. He has a softer side, as he does care about his friends, and loves his family and wife Amy Farrah Fowler, though he often insults them either about their intellect levels or different opinions. In seasons 1\u20139, he shares an apartment in [[Pasadena, California|Pasadena]] with friend and fellow physicist Dr. Leonard Hofstadter.\n\nHe has a deep love and interest for science fiction and comic books, to the point of an obsession, and shows particular affinity for [[Spock]] from the ''[[Star Trek]]'' franchise. He refrains from any form of physical contact and exhibits a strict adherence to routines to the point of exhibiting signs of [[obsessive\u2013compulsive personality disorder]]. Any disruption to routines distresses him enormously. A running gag has him always knocking on doors in a pattern of three knocks and one call repeated three times. In the interests of making life run on rational and predictable lines, he requires Leonard to sign a legalistic and exhaustive \"Roommate Agreement\", and later imposes a similar \"Relationship Agreement\" on Amy.\n\nSheldon has trouble in social settings. His commitment to his friends is often called into question, as he is known for being constantly and consistently, if unintentionally, condescending and rude. He also has difficulties lying or keeping a secret, giving himself away with wild facial tics and implausible statements. He is, however, fond of occasionally telling a joke or playing a prank, which he typically punctuates with his trademark exclamation \"Bazinga!\" He has a [[superiority complex]] and makes no effort to hide his contempt for other people's lower intellects, often making highly inappropriate comments.\n\nSheldon meets Amy Farrah Fowler in the third-season finale and starts a slowly evolving relationship with her. In the tenth season, the two move in together for a five-week experiment to test their compatibility and later decide to make the arrangement permanent. At the end of that same season, admirer Ramona Nowitzki makes a romantic overture to Sheldon, prompting him to propose to Amy. In the finale of season eleven, Sheldon and Amy get married. In the series finale, Sheldon and Amy jointly share [[Nobel Prize in Physics|the Nobel Prize in Physics]] for their work on Super-Asymmetry.\n\n==== Penny ====\n<!-- NOTE: Do not add \"Hofstadter\". Leave as the common name that is used, which is just \"Penny\". Changing to \"Penny Hofstadter\" breaks multiple incoming links, -->\n{{main|Penny (The Big Bang Theory)}}\n[[File:Kaley Cuoco at PaleyFest 2013.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Kaley Cuoco]]]]\n\nPenny ([[Kaley Cuoco]])<!--DO NOT ADD 'SWEETING' HERE. SEE THAT IT IS NOTED AT THE END OF THIS SECTION. -->, is Leonard and Sheldon's neighbor across the hallway. Originally from a small town outside [[Omaha, Nebraska]], she was a waitress and occasional bartender at the local [[The Cheesecake Factory|Cheesecake Factory]] until season seven, and is an aspiring actress. According to Sheldon, she is a \"good-natured simpleton\". She is kind-hearted, outgoing, and does display the most common sense out of all the original five main characters. She also appears to be the most street-smart. Her lack of educational qualifications (she dropped out of community college) are a constant source of disparaging comments from Sheldon.\n\nShe has dated several men during the course of the series, including Kurt, Stuart, and Zack, but her recurring romantic interest is Leonard. Leonard pursued Penny during season one and they dated briefly at the start of season two, which led to some awkwardness. They began dating again and were a couple for most of season three, but she ended the relationship after he told her he loved her and she was not ready to reciprocate. Penny and Leonard begin to date again during the fifth season. After several unsuccessful proposals from both sides, Penny realizes that her happiness is derived from her relationship with Leonard and they become engaged and later elope, upsetting their friends and families and leading to a wedding redo with their friends and families present. In the series finale \"The Stockholm Syndrome\", it is revealed that Penny is pregnant with her and Leonard's first child. She has a tense relationship with Sheldon, whose nerdy and obstinate personality often exasperates her, but they are ultimately good friends, helping each other in various situations. By season four, Penny also begins to socialize more with Bernadette and Amy, who frequently visit Penny's apartment, go out together, and comfort each other.\n\nAt the start of season eight, Penny pursues a career in pharmaceuticals and interviews for a job at Bernadette's workplace. She gets the job, and gradually becomes more independent, including earning a higher salary than Leonard. She reveals in season nine that she is not happy with her job, but insists on keeping it to help her eliminate her former credit card debts and secure a good financial future. In season 10, Leonard and Penny are finally living alone in apartment 4A after Sheldon moves in with Amy. In the series finale \"The Stockholm Syndrome\", it is revealed that they are expecting their first child. \n\nInitially, not much is known about Penny's family, but it is mentioned in the series that her father, Wyatt (portrayed by [[Keith Carradine]],<ref name=\"S04E9\">{{cite episode|title=The Boyfriend Complexity|series=The Big Bang Theory|episodelink=The Big Bang Theory (season 4)#ep72|serieslink=The Big Bang Theory|date=November 18, 2010|season=4|number=9|minutes=3:30}}</ref>) raised her like a boy, her mother smoked marijuana while she was pregnant with her, her sister shot her husband while they were intoxicated, and her brother is a [[Methamphetamine|meth]] dealer. Her mother, Susan ([[Katey Sagal]]), and brother, Randall ([[Jack McBrayer]]), are finally seen in the first episode of [[The Big Bang Theory (season 10)|season ten]].\n\n==== Howard ====\n{{main|Howard Wolowitz}}\n[[File:Simon Helberg at PaleyFest 2013.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Simon Helberg]]]]\n\nHoward Joel<ref name=\"S04E7\">{{cite episode|title=The Apology Insufficiency|series=The Big Bang Theory|episodelink=The Big Bang Theory (season 4)#ep70|serieslink=The Big Bang Theory|date=November 4, 2010|season=4|number=7|minutes=12:50}}</ref> Wolowitz, [[Master of Engineering|M.Eng.]] ([[Simon Helberg]]) is an [[aerospace engineer]] at Caltech's Department of [[Applied physics|Applied Physics]], who often hangs out at Leonard and Sheldon's apartment. Unlike Sheldon, Leonard, and Raj, Howard does not have a doctorate, and often gets disparaged as a result, especially by Sheldon. He defends this by pointing out that he has a master's degree in Engineering from [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]] and that the equipment he designs is launched into space, unlike the theoretical work of his friends. In the fifth-season finale, Howard goes to the [[International Space Station]] on [[Expedition 31]].\n\nHoward lives in [[Altadena, California|Altadena]] with his domineering, belittling, and unseen mother, who treats him like a child. While he sometimes expresses irritation at this treatment, for the most part, he appears to prefer it.<ref name=\"S06E7\">{{cite episode|title=The Habitation Configuration|series=The Big Bang Theory|episodelink=The Big Bang Theory (season 6)#ep118|serieslink=The Big Bang Theory|date=November 8, 2012|season=6|number=7}}</ref> Howard dotes on his mother and participates in many of her daily routines. A recurring gimmick in the series is Howard and his mother communicating with each other from different rooms by yelling, a habit which Bernadette also adopts in later episodes. His father left them when he was 11, and Howard gets visibly distressed when the subject comes up. Howard fancies himself a ladies' man and attempts [[pick-up line]]s whenever a woman is present, although he drops this habit once he starts going out with Bernadette. He is Jewish, but is not serious about his faith, and does not keep [[Kashrut|kosher]]. However, he does observe the [[Shabbat|Sabbath]] and the [[Jewish holidays]].\n\nIn the pilot episode, he speaks English, French, Mandarin, Russian, Arabic, and Persian, along with fictional languages like [[Klingon language|Klingon]] and [[Sindarin]]. Howard suffers from asthma, transient idiopathic arrhythmia, [[Peanut allergy|allergies to peanuts]], almonds, and walnuts, and is prone to canker sores and pink eye. Howard dated Bernadette briefly in season three. After some difficulties, they resumed their relationship in season four, which culminated in their engagement. In the fifth-season finale, Howard and Bernadette are married on the roof of the apartment building shortly before he has to leave for Kazakhstan, where he is to be sent to the International Space Station. In season six, he finally leaves his mother's house and moves into Bernadette's apartment.<ref name=\"S05E24\">{{cite episode|title=The Countdown Reflection|series=The Big Bang Theory|episodelink=The Big Bang Theory (season 5)#ep111|serieslink=The Big Bang Theory|date=May 10, 2012|season=5|number=24}}</ref> In the episode \"The Comic Book Store Regeneration\", Howard's mother passes away in her sleep while in Florida, prompting him to move back into his home with Bernadette. Stuart, the owner of the guys' favorite comic book store, also moves in.\n\nUpon learning that Bernadette is pregnant in season nine, Howard panics about handling the impending baby, particularly earning enough money. With the help of his friends, he designs a new form of guidance system that attracts the attention of the [[United States Air Force|Air Force]]. In \"The Birthday Synchronicity\", Bernadette gives birth to a girl named Halley, on Amy's birthday, who screams like Howard's late mother, Debbie Wolowitz.\n\nIn season 11, Howard learns that Bernadette is pregnant again and later in the same season in \"The Neonatal Nomenclature\", Bernadette gives birth to a boy named Neil Michael Wolowitz.\n\n==== Raj ====\n{{main|Raj Koothrappali}}\n[[File:Kunal Nayyar at PaleyFest 2013.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Kunal Nayyar]]]]\n\nRajesh Ramayan<ref name=\"S02E21\">{{cite episode|title=The Vegas Renormalization|series=The Big Bang Theory|episodelink=The Big Bang Theory (season 2)#ep38|serieslink=The Big Bang Theory|date=April 27, 2009|season=2|number=21|minutes=9:42}}</ref><ref name=\"S03E12\">{{cite episode|title=The Psychic Vortex|series=The Big Bang Theory|episodelink=The Big Bang Theory (season 3)#ep52|serieslink=The Big Bang Theory|date=January 11, 2010|season=3|number=12|minutes=8:25}}</ref> Koothrappali, [[Doctor of Philosophy|PhD]] ([[Kunal Nayyar]]) is Howard Wolowitz's best friend and another genius of the group. His name is usually shortened to \"Raj\". He is from [[New Delhi]], [[India]], and works in the physics department at Caltech, where his area of expertise is [[astroparticle physics]]. He lives in an apartment in Pasadena. As with his friends, he is mutually involved with and obsessed with science fiction and comic books in general. He is also a [[Harry Potter fandom|fan of Harry Potter]] and [[Music of India|Indian music]], but appreciates the Indian lullabies his mother sang and the catchiness of [[Hindi]] phrases. Raj is a [[Hindu]] and believes in [[karma]] ([[reincarnation]]), but eats beef. He is very shy around women outside of his family, and during the first six seasons of the show, found himself [[selective mutism|unable to speak to women while in their presence]] unless he drank [[alcoholic drink|alcoholic beverages]], or [[Placebo|believed he had done so]].<ref name=\"S01E08\"/> When Penny, Amy, and Bernadette were around, Raj usually whispered what he wanted to say to Howard or Leonard, who then repeated or responded to what Raj said aloud. Despite this, Raj has sometimes ended up in bed with women, leaving the other characters perplexed.<ref>{{cite episode|title=The Middle Earth Paradigm|series=The Big Bang Theory|episodelink=The Big Bang Theory (season 1)#ep6|serieslink=The Big Bang Theory|date=October 29, 2007|season=1|number=6}}</ref>\n\nUnlike his friends, Raj has many feminine interests, such as reading ''[[Archie Comics|Archie]]'' comics and ''[[Twilight (Meyer novel)|Twilight]]'' and watching [[chick flick]]s such as ''[[Bridget Jones's Diary (film)|Bridget Jones's Diary]]''. A recurring joke in the series has people, including his parents and Leonard's mother, speculating that Raj might be [[Homosexuality|gay]] due to his feminine interests and his close friendship with Howard, with whom he has arguments similar to those of a married couple. However, Raj has always stated that he is [[Heterosexuality|straight]], but [[metrosexual]]. He had an infatuation with Penny, and secretly wrote love poems about Bernadette. Raj comes from a very wealthy family in India, and often communicates with his parents, Dr. and Mrs. Koothrappali, via webcam.<ref name=\"S01E08\"/> He has a younger sister, Priya.\n\nIn season six, Raj started seeing a shy and sweet woman named Lucy, who had many things in common with Raj. However, she feels too pressured when he asks her to meet his friends and breaks up with him. As of season seven, he no longer requires alcohol, drugs, or medication to speak in front of women. In season seven, Raj starts dating Emily Sweeney, a dermatologist, and their relationship becomes exclusive at the end of the seventh season. In the ninth season, he meets a bartender/scriptwriter and dates her along with Emily. However, in season ten, he mentions he is currently single. After his parents divorced, Raj's father ended his financial support and he was forced to move into Leonard and Penny's apartment. Due to friction between them, Raj moved into an apartment over Bert's garage. After starting to live on his own and learning to manage his own finances, Raj has finally started to work at the Observatory where his expertise is more highlighted. In the final season, Raj's father arranges a marriage for him with an Indian hotel concierge named Anu. They breakup when she take a job in London.\n\n==== Leslie Winkle ====\n[[File:Sara Gilbert.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Sara Gilbert]]]]\n\nLeslie Winkle, PhD ([[Sara Gilbert]]) is an experimental physicist who works in the same lab as Leonard. In appearance, she is essentially Leonard's female counterpart, equipped with the black-framed glasses and sweat jackets. She also has a [[Amblyopia|lazy eye]]. Leslie had [[casual sex]]ual relationships with both Leonard and Howard, considering it a completely physical reaction to her body's cycles. She is one of Sheldon's arch-enemies, due to their conflicting scientific theories.\n\nSara Gilbert made her first appearance in the [[The Big Bang Theory (season 1)#ep3|third episode]] of [[The Big Bang Theory (season 1)|season one]] and her final appearance as a regular in the [[The Big Bang Theory (season 3)|third-season]] finale. ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' reported in January 2009 that she had been downgraded from starring status to recurring because the producers of the series were unable to come up with new storylines for the character.<ref>{{cite journal |first=Michael |last=Ausiello |title=''Big Bang Theory'' scoop: Sara Gilbert taken off contract |url=http://www.ew.com/article/2009/01/23/big-bang-theory |journal=Entertainment Weekly |date=January 23, 2009 |accessdate=November 5, 2016}}</ref> She returned for a guest role in the 200th episode, \"[[The Celebration Experimentation]]\", in season nine, with her character talking briefly about how she and Sheldon have changed over the years and affectionately calls him \"dumbass\" again at Sheldon's insistence (due to his [[Sheldon Cooper#Personality|dislike for change]]).\n\n==== Bernadette ====\n<!-- NOTE: Please leave the heading of this section as \"Bernadette\", the name by which she is commonly known, and credited in episodes and press releases.

She is a smart, short-tempered, ruthless, and often competitive young woman who sometimes displays a sweet, nice, and friendly personality. Despite her squeaky voice, she has a darker side. A recurring joke in the series references Bernadette and her lab team handling dangerous or infectious specimens, leading to accidental byproducts or exposure to diseases, in some cases resulting in Bernadette being quarantined.\n\nBernadette is of [[Poland|Polish]] origin and [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] upbringing, and was originally seen wearing a cross necklace. She frequently [[psychological manipulation|manipulates]] people, often pretending to be a friendly and good-natured individual, quickly making friends with Penny and Amy, as well as the rest of the gang. Despite her short stature, she is regarded as being somewhat intimidating, largely because of her sharp tongue, aggressive demeanor, and occasional signs of mania. In season eight's \"The Locomotion Interruption\", Penny interviews for a pharmaceutical sales representative position with Bernadette's boss, and secures it because she concurs with his opinion that Bernadette is kind of a bully and that they are slightly terrified of her.\n\nPenny first introduced Bernadette to Howard on Leonard's request. During their first date, Bernadette and Howard do not find any common field of interest until they discover that they both have domineering mothers. After their third date, Bernadette declares that three dates is the threshold for deciding whether they want a long-term relationship. Blindsided, Howard hesitates initially, causing a temporary rift between them, but then impulsively proposes marriage to show her that he does care about her. Frustrated, she declines, but when he sings a heartfelt song for her at the Cheesecake Factory, she declares that it is the most romantic thing anyone has ever done for her and their relationship continues. A lengthy offscreen breakup occurs when she catches Howard engaging in [[cybersex]], but Howard apologizes and their relationship resumes.\n\nIn her initial appearances in the third season, Bernadette does not use her high-pitched speaking voice and is portrayed as almost a dim-witted blonde by taking things literally and not understanding even the simplest of ideas. She mentions this fact in season four's \"The Alien Parasite Hypothesis\", where she says she is much smarter than Howard, but in order to protect his manhood, she acted dumber.\n{{anchor|Zangen}}\nIn the fourth season finale, she obtains her doctorate and is subsequently hired by a pharmaceutical company (Zangen) that offers her a high salary. While preparing for their wedding in the fifth season, Bernadette is shocked and repulsed when she learns about Howard's past sexual escapades, although once again, an apology and reconciliation occurs in the same episode. They marry the day before Howard leaves for his upcoming mission to the [[International Space Station]].\n\nDuring seasons six and seven, the newlyweds deal with Howard's difficulty in readjusting to life on Earth, the struggle to keep a healthy relationship with Howard's mother, and arguments over money. In the ninth-season episode, \"The Valentino Submergence\", Bernadette reveals that she is pregnant, informing Howard in the next episode. She comically reveals that the baby was conceived in Sheldon's bed, much to Sheldon's chagrin. Raj learns about the baby's gender and inadvertently reveals that the child is a girl. In \"The Birthday Synchronicity\" Bernadette gives birth to a girl named Halley who screams like the baby's late grandmother, [[Debbie Wolowitz]].\n\nIn season 11, Bernadette learns that she is again pregnant, while Howard is telling her Sheldon and Amy got engaged. Her doctor puts her on six-months bed rest, which makes her fond of watching detective and criminal-themed TV shows. In \"The Neonatal Nomenclature\" Bernadette gives birth to a boy named Neil Michael Wolowitz (Neil for Armstong, Gaiman and Diamond and Michael for Bernadette's father), but she insists that she and Howard call him by his middle name Michael. In season 12, Bernadette pushes Penny in her sales career.\n\n==== Amy ====\n{{main|Amy Farrah Fowler}}\n[[File:Mayim Bialik, March 2018 (4116) (cropped).jpg|thumb|upright|[[Mayim Bialik]]]]\nAmy Farrah Fowler<!-- Do not change this to \"Cooper\". Amy has not used that name! -->, PhD ([[Mayim Bialik]] [[Doctor of Philosophy|PhD]]) is a neuroscientist and Sheldon's love interest in the series. She has a PhD in neurobiology (Bialik herself has a PhD in neuroscience), with a research focus on addiction in primates and invertebrates, occasionally mentioning such experiments as getting a [[capuchin monkey]] addicted to cigarettes or starfish addicted to cocaine.\n\nRaj and Howard found Amy through an online dating site after secretly establishing an account using Sheldon's name and information. The site matches her to Sheldon, and the two share many similar traits. Once she and Sheldon meet, she becomes, as Sheldon puts it, a girl who is his friend, but not his \"girlfriend\". The two initially communicate by computer, but at the encouragement of the group, she starts socializing with the gang in person.\n\nEarly on, Amy is essentially a female counterpart to Sheldon. She is coldly rational, displays little emotion, and is awkward in social situations ranging from endearing to embarrassing. In season five, after Amy goes out on a date with comic-book store owner Stuart, Sheldon decides to solidify their relationship as boyfriend/girlfriend with a 31-page \"Relationship Agreement\". Later in the season, Amy begins a campaign to increase Sheldon's feelings for her by becoming more involved in his interests, including video games and ''[[Star Trek]],'' and treating him as his mother did. Sheldon says during Howard and Bernadette's wedding ceremony that he hopes the two of them are as happy together as he is alone, hurting Amy's feelings, but he spontaneously takes her hand for comfort later as Howard is launched into space.\n\nBy the beginning of season six, they are regularly holding hands at Amy's insistence, but Sheldon repeatedly resists all of her attempts to engage in further physical intimacy. By mid-season, Sheldon gets some intimate views of Amy when he cares for her while she has the flu, pushing him further toward a traditional relationship with her. She also provides Sheldon with consoling hugs, and receives a slap on the rear by an intoxicated Sheldon who tells everyone that she is a great gal.\n\nThey eventually move into Penny's old apartment together, while Penny moves in with Leonard, and later make the arrangement permanent. Amy is later offered a three-month course at a science camp in New Jersey and leaves with Sheldon's encouragement. She becomes angry when she learns of Sheldon spending time with Ramona Nowitzki, who she suspects has romantic feelings for Sheldon (which she does). In the season finale, after Ramona kisses Sheldon, he visits Amy and proposes to her. The episode ends on a [[cliffhanger]] awaiting her answer. In the season 11 premiere episode \"The Proposal Proposal\", which picks up immediately after Sheldon's proposal, Amy's answer is further delayed by a phone call from Leonard and Penny, after which she finally says yes. She and Sheldon marry in the season 11 finale. Amy objects to Sheldon wanting to provide sperm for Zack Johnson's baby, but does try and get him excited about having their own child.\n\nIn the final season, Sheldon and Amy publish their work on super-asymmetric string theory and win the Nobel Prize in Physics together.<ref>\"The Big Bang Theory Finale: EPs Talk Elevator Twist, Sheldon's Speech, Howard and Bernadette's [Spoilers],\" ''TV Line'' (May 16, 2019) https://tvline.com/2019/05/16/big-bang-theory-series-finale-sheldon-amy-nobel-prize/</ref>\n\n==== Stuart ====\n[[File:Kevin Sussman by Gage Skidmore.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Kevin Sussman]]]]\nStuart David Bloom<ref>{{cite episode|title=The Commitment Determination|episodelink=The Big Bang Theory (season 8)#ep183|series=The Big Bang Theory|serieslink=The Big Bang Theory|network=[[CBS]]|date=May 4, 2015|season= 8|number=24|time=13:35}} Howard tells Bernadette his middle name, because he wants her to make him move out of his mother's house.</ref><ref>{{cite episode|title=The Flaming Spittoon Acquisition|episodelink=The Flaming Spittoon Acquisition|series=The Big Bang Theory|serieslink=The Big Bang Theory|network=CBS|date=November 17, 2011|season=5|number=10|time=11:44}} Sheldon is viewing Stuart's Facebook page, where his name is shown as \"Stuart Bloom\".</ref> ([[Kevin Sussman]]) runs the Comic Center in Pasadena,<ref>{{cite episode|title=The Comet Polarization|series=The Big Bang Theory|network=CBS|date=April 19, 2018|season=11|number=21}}</ref> the comic book store that the characters often visit. Stuart is characterized by his low self-esteem and loneliness, which often result in pathetic attempts to engage with women and win favor with the main cast. This is despite owning his own (albeit troubled) business, and being a talented portraiture artist who attended the [[Rhode Island School of Design]].<ref>{{cite episode|title=The Hofstadter Isotope|series=The Big Bang Theory|network=CBS|date=April 13, 2009|season=2|number=20}}</ref>\n\nDuring Stuart's first appearances in season 2, he shows enough social skills to ask Penny on a date on two occasions, though neither ends successfully. In \"The Hofstadter Isotope\", his first date with Penny goes well for most of the evening, but when they return to her apartment, their run-in with Sheldon devolves into an endless argument between Stuart and Sheldon over the minutiae of ''[[Batman (comic book)|Batman]]'' comics that puts Penny to sleep. In \"The Classified Materials Turbulence\", their second date unravels when in the throes of a romantic embrace, Penny calls him \"Leonard\", ending any future prospects for them as a couple. In season five, Stuart goes on a date with Amy, but Sheldon interrupts the date to solidify his relationship with her.\n\nStuart was the partner of [[Wil Wheaton]] in a [[collectible card game|trading-card game]] tournament in which they defeated the team of Raj and Sheldon. As proprietor of a comic-book store, Stuart has an almost encyclopedic knowledge of comic books and superheroes. In the season-four episode \"[[The Toast Derivation]]\", he mentions that he is in financial trouble and that the store is now also his home, and over the years, he has questioned the profitability or success running the store.\n\nDuring \"The Decoupling Fluctuation\", Stuart becomes close friends with Raj and joins the gang as Howard's replacement while he is in space. When Howard returns, Sheldon wants to dismiss Stuart from the group, but Raj objects. Leonard tie-breaks on the basis that they are receiving a 20% discount in Stuart's store, and Sheldon relents after Stuart offers to go as high as 30%, thereby becoming a bigger and more prominent part of the core group. Sheldon has tried to hide his clear belief that Stuart is more of a hanger-on to the group of friends than a core member, most notably in a story where Stuart was part of a motley \"test brunch\" along with Burt the geologist and a neighbor who only spoke English she'd heard on TV, so Sheldon could work-out any hosting issues before trying an event with his \"real\" friends. Stuart actually got angry and told Sheldon it was clear they didn't even see him as a friend, leading Sheldon to sincerely apologize and try harder to be nice to Stuart for a period. Stuart is also limited vis-\u00e0-vis the group because he is a lot like Raj, a mostly-single guy around three couples, but Raj is best friends with Howard and closer friends with the others than Stuart.\n\nAfter his comic-book store is destroyed in a fire, Howard offers him a place to stay and a job as his mother, Debbie's, nurse. Stuart likes the job and develops a surprising closeness with Debbie, even staying long after she recovers, to Howard's annoyance. After Debbie's death, Howard and Bernadette move back into the house, with Stuart still staying. In the eighth-season finale, the two attempt to ask Stuart to move out, but are unable to bring themselves to do it after Stuart reveals it is his birthday. He eventually makes his own decision to move in the middle of season 9; however in the middle of season 10, he reveals that he has been evicted from his apartment and tries to use his helping with Howard and Bernadette's baby to move back in with them, much to Raj's chagrin. He does not always appear with the main group, as he was somehow not at Howard and Bernadette's during the birth of their 2nd child Neil.\n\nKevin Sussman was a recurring guest actor from seasons two to five, and was promoted to starring role for the sixth season onwards.<ref>{{cite journal |first=Nellie |last=Andreeva |title=''Big Bang Theory'' 's Kevin Sussman Upped To Regular |url=http://deadline.com/2012/08/big-bang-theorys-kevin-sussman-upped-to-regular-323353/ |journal=[[Deadline Hollywood]] |date=August 22, 2012 |accessdate=November 5, 2016}}</ref>\n\nDuring season 11, he hires a woman named Denise ([[Lauren Lapkus]]), at his shop, and becomes attracted to her. In the season 11 finale, Denise is his date to Sheldon and Amy's wedding, where she exhibits an attraction to Stuart when he displays a superior level of knowledge of ''Star Wars'' trivia to [[Mark Hamill]], who is performing the ceremony. In the second episode of season 12, they are revealed to have made out at the ceremony, and have their first date at the end of that episode.\n\n==== Emily ====\nEmily Sweeney, [[Doctor of Medicine|M.D.]], ([[Laura Spencer (actress)|Laura Spencer]]) is a [[dermatology]] [[resident (medicine)|resident]] at [[Huntington Hospital]], whom Raj finds on an online dating site. Emily went to Harvard and is shown to have a slightly alarming personality trait: she delights in the [[macabre]].\n\nIn season seven, after finding Emily's online dating profile, Raj has Amy contact her. Amy and Emily exchange emails and find they have a lot in common. Emily does not like Raj's inability to correspond with her directly; but, when he does agree to meet her, he acts weirdly and she leaves. Raj later bumps into Emily and apologizes for their previous encounter. She gives him another chance and agrees to go out to dinner with him. In \"The Relationship Diremption\", Raj and Emily have dinner with Howard and Bernadette. Upon meeting Emily, Howard recognizes her from a blind date they had sometime before he met Bernadette. The blind date ended badly, causing him embarrassment at the dinner, but no issues.\n\nIn \"The Gorilla Dissolution\", Raj and Sheldon bump into Emily at the movies with another guy. Later, she visits him to talk and reveals that the guy was her tattoo artist who had been asking her out for weeks and she did so just to end the obligation. Emily then spends the night; and, in the next episode, Raj reveals to the gang that Emily and he are exclusive.\n\nIn season eight, Raj introduces Emily to Leonard and Penny; however, Penny senses that Emily does not like her. Emily reveals that she is uncomfortable with the fact that Raj and Penny previously kissed. Emily and Penny later sit down to settle their differences, with mixed results. Emily continues to socialize with the gang in season 8, and in the finale, she suggests to Raj that they have sex in a graveyard. Raj wonders whether he should break up with her because of her alarming personality. The next season, Raj somewhat rashly breaks up with Emily after meeting another girl, Claire, and fantasizing about starting a family with her, though Claire makes amends with her boyfriend and berates Raj for his actions. He tries to reconcile with Emily, but she shuts the door in his face. Later in the season, Emily and Raj reconcile after a tearful phone call. However, in season 10, Raj mentions that he is currently single. He and Howard invite Emily, Claire, Lucy, and Emily the deaf woman to Raj's apartment for an intervention to find out why women keep dumping Raj. Emily mentions that, although she enjoyed her sexual relationship with Raj, she was put off by his fear of his parents.\n\nLaura Spencer was a recurring guest actress on the series in seasons seven and eight. During production of season 9, she was promoted to a \"fractional\" starring role; the upgraded status ensured her availability on an as-needed basis, without requiring her in every episode.<ref>{{cite journal |first=Michael |last=Ausiello |title=''The Big Bang Theory'': Laura Spencer Promoted to Series Regular |url=http://tvline.com/2015/10/12/big-bang-theory-season-9-laura-spencer-series-regular-emily/ |journal=[[TVLine]] |date=October 12, 2015 |accessdate=November 5, 2016}}</ref> She returned as a guest in season 10; the character was written out of the series, and did not appear after season 10.\n\n=== ''Young Sheldon'' main characters ===\n\n==== Mary Cooper ====\nMary (''n\u00e9e'' Tucker)<ref name=\"sheldonS1E17\">''[[Young Sheldon]]'' episode \"Jiu-Jitsu, Bubble Wrap, and Yoo-Hoo\"</ref> Cooper ([[Zoe Perry]]) is Sheldon's loving, caring and religious mother and a [[Christians|devout Christian]] from Texas. She has two other children besides Sheldon; Sheldon's twin sister, Missy, and his brother George, who is shown via a family tree to be three or four years older than Sheldon and Missy. Her husband, a rambunctious [[alcoholism|alcoholic]], was also named George, but he died when Sheldon was still a boy. To Mary's relief, her other children do not share Sheldon's hyperintelligence, once commenting to Leonard, \"I thank the good Lord my other kids are as dumb as soup\". Mary herself is not intellectual, but is quite wise, though she is prone to making insensitive comments such as calling Japanese words \"kung fu letters\" at a sushi restaurant, or calling Native Americans [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|\"our\" Indians]]. Despite her religious views, she is tolerant of other faiths, as evidenced by her serving Raj a dish of chicken after making sure it was not something Indians considered \"magical\". She also struggles to follow her beliefs sometimes. She is a loving mother and has been able to control Sheldon, with Leonard describing her as Sheldon's \"[[Kryptonite]]\" to Penny. When Penny and Sheldon engaged in a fierce dispute, Penny called for Mary's help, who subsequently called and scolded Sheldon about his actions.<ref name=\"S02E07\">{{Cite episode|title=The Panty Pi\u00f1ata Polarization|episodelink=List of The Big Bang Theory episodes#ep24|series=The Big Bang Theory|serieslink=The Big Bang Theory|date=November 10, 2008|season=2|number=7}}</ref> Leonard wishes his mother were<!-- subjunctive --> as loving as Sheldon's mother, although Sheldon himself appears at best ambivalent about her parenting. Sheldon once mentions that Mary once hit him with a Bible because he refused to eat his Brussels sprouts. She apparently thought something was wrong with her son while he was growing up, as Sheldon will often remark after someone calls him crazy, \"I'm not crazy; my mother had me tested!\" Though Mary confirms this, she wishes that she had taken him to Houston for further testing.\n\nIn her first visit, Leonard calls Mary to intervene when Sheldon is fired for being disrespectful to his new boss, Dr. Gablehauser. She manages to convince Sheldon to apologize and he gets his job back, and she becomes romantically interested in Dr. Gablehauser. When Sheldon asks, \"Is Dr. Gablehauser going to be my new daddy?\", Mary replies, \"We'll see\".\n\nIn season three of The Big Bang Theory, after returning from the North Pole, Sheldon returns to his home in Texas after the other guys tampered with his research. Mary calls the guys and they come to fetch Sheldon. Sheldon initially refuses to leave, although after an argument with his mother about [[evolution]], Sheldon decides to leave. Mary is again called to intervene in \"The Zazzy Substitution\" when Sheldon buys a clowder of cats after his \"break-up\" with Amy. Mary uses [[reverse psychology]] to get Sheldon to reconcile with Amy. She again comes to visit in \"The Rhinitis Revelation\" before going on a Christian cruise, and Sheldon becomes jealous when she would rather go sightseeing with the rest of the gang instead of cooking for him and attending physics lectures.\n\nIn season seven of The Big Bang Theory, Sheldon returns to Texas to assist Mary in the birth of his twin sister's baby. Howard later takes Sheldon to see Mary after visiting [[NASA]] headquarters, but flees after Sheldon sees her having sex. Sheldon returns and gets into an argument, and is sent to his room. After Howard tells him about how he drove away an admirer of his mother, Sheldon apologizes to Mary, saying that he will accept her choices on the outside while condemning her internally for being a hypocrite by going against her religious beliefs. Mary forgives him.\n\nIn season 8 of The Big Bang Theory, Mary meets Dr. Beverly Hofstadter, Leonard's mother. The two very different women start out as civil, but later quickly come to clash as Beverly insults and belittles Mary strict religious beliefs, and Mary in turn derides Beverly's cold attitude. Mary is especially insulted when Beverly is left dumbstruck how a genius intellect like Sheldon could be born to a woman like her. After taking a break from each other, the two come to terms with the argument: Mary decides to forgive Beverly for her offhandish ways, and Beverly realizes there is more than one way to raise a child. The two mothers make up and Beverly tries unconditional love by trying an awkward hug with Leonard.\n\nIn season nine of The Big Bang Theory, Sheldon calls her to tell her that Amy broke up with him and that he would like to send the family heirloom engagement ring back, but she advises him to hold on to it, just in case. She reappears in the season finale \"The Convergence-Convergence\" where she comes to attend Leonard and Penny's re-wedding where she is not at all happy to see Beverly. She meets Leonard's father Alfred Hofstadter and the two get along great as they have each other's nice, gentle, and caring personalities, bonding over their mutual dislike of Beverly, and their admiration of each other's beliefs. The two of them end up fighting with Beverly at the restaurant during the pre-ceremony dinner and the two leave together and after finding out they are staying at the same hotel, they decide to share a cab and it is implied that the two hook up. \n\nIn season 10 of The Big Bang Theory, during a visit to see her, Sheldon and Amy break it to her they are living together and Sheldon is stunned that she is not offended that they are \"[[cohabitation|living in sin]]\" due to her belief he was never going to find anyone.\n\nIn season 11 of The Big Bang Theory, Mary reappeared in the season premiere, \"The Proposal Proposal,\" when Sheldon phoned her to tell her that he and Amy were engaged. Mary was happy for both of them, but she was not surprised, as she had been praying for them. Sheldon informed his mother that they would not be getting married in a church, which was okay with Mary, as she said anywhere Jesus is a church, and he'll be there in her heart. She was also quite surprised to hear that there was more than one woman interested in Sheldon, otherwise she might've prayed a little too hard. After hanging up, Mary thanks the Lord for making the engagement happen, and that even though he (the Lord) can do anything, that was mighty impressive.\n\nShe reappeared in the \"The Solo Oscillation,\" where she called Sheldon, who was annoyed by it, since he was trying to find something to work on.\n\nIn \"The Bow Tie Asymmetry\", Mary and her daughter Missy are picked up from the airport by Raj. She mentions that they had also been driven to the airport by an Indian fellow. Missy object to her comment. Mary also is in denial that her daughter is also separated from her husband. Later at the wedding, when Mrs. Fowler wants to take her daughter way because she thinks that Sheldon has left her at the altar, Penny tells her to stop and that Sheldon would never hurt the woman he loves. Mary stands up and applauds Penny who tells her to sit down too. Mary also tells Sheldon how proud she is of him and that her comment that sometimes it is the imperfections in things that make things perfect gives Sheldon an epiphany about his string theory work.\n\nMary has argued with Leonard's mother, Beverly, over the fact she never nurtured Leonard properly the way she has with Sheldon, while Beverly has criticized her for her narrow-minded beliefs.\n\nA younger version of Mary (played by Metcalf's real-life daughter [[Zoe Perry]]) is a main character in the prequel series ''[[Young Sheldon]]''. It is revealed in season 2 that Mary became a devout Christian after a difficult birth with Sheldon and Missy where Missy almost died. It is also revealed that she had a miscarriage after the pregnancy with Sheldon and Missy. In season 3 it is revealed that she was forced into a [[shotgun wedding]] with George.\n\n==== George Sr. ====\nGeorge Cooper, Sr. is the father of Georgie, Sheldon and Missy Cooper and the husband of Mary Tucker-Cooper. In ''The Big Bang Theory'', it is established that he died when Sheldon and Missy were fourteen years old. He is portrayed by [[Lance Barber]].\n\n==== Georgie Jr. ====\nGeorge \"Georgie\" Cooper Jr. ([[Jerry O'Connell]]): Sheldon and Missy's brother, who lives in Texas and runs a car tire business. Often at odds while growing up, the Cooper brothers begin to reconcile their differences when Sheldon and Leonard visit George in season 11 before Sheldon's wedding. Known as Georgie in his younger days, he appears as a main character on ''[[Young Sheldon]]'' played by [[Montana Jordan]].\n\n==== Missy ====\n{{Expand section|More on her escapades in Young Sheldon|small=no|date=November 2019}}\n{{visible anchor|Missy Cooper}} (Raegan Revord): She is intellectually and socially quite unlike her brother.\n\nThe adult version of the character is played by [[Courtney Henggeler]] and appears in the episode \"The Porkchop Indeterminacy\" of ''Big Bang Theory''. Missy has grown up to be a tall, attractive woman that promptly catches the attention of Leonard, Howard, and Raj. Sheldon realizes that, within Missy's eggs, lies the potential for another \"superior mutation\" like him. He temporarily sets himself up as a guardian to Missy in order to choose the best mate for her. Missy refers to Sheldon as \"Shelly\" and, despite their differences, she loves him and is proud of his accomplishments. In \"The Cooper Extraction\", she gives birth to a baby boy with Sheldon helping while her husband is recovering from a motorcycle accident, but does not appear on-screen. Henggeler reprises the role in the eleventh-season finale \"The Bow Tie Asymmetry\", where Missy, pregnant with her second child, travels with her mother to Pasadena to attend Sheldon's wedding. It is mentioned that she is separated from her husband, which piques Raj's interest.\n\n==== MeeMaw ====\n[[File:June Squibb Cannes 2013.jpg|thumb|upright|[[June Squibb]]]]\nConstance \"MeeMaw\" Tucker<ref name=\"sheldonS1E17\" /> ([[June Squibb]]): Sheldon's grandmother from Texas. Sheldon is her favorite grandchild, whom she calls \"[[Moonpie]]\". Sheldon, in turn, is very affectionate and protective toward her; while he can be very critical of other family members, he will not allow anyone to criticize his grandmother. Meemaw is often mentioned by Sheldon, but did not appear on the series until episode 14 of season nine, \"The Meemaw Manifestation\".\n\nMeemaw takes an immediate dislike to Amy upon meeting her. It appears she came to visit her grandson, but the real reason she came was to size Amy up and she dislikes Amy because of her breaking Sheldon's heart when she broke up with him. Meemaw keeps this to herself until dinner where she reveals this in front of her grandson, his girlfriend and the married Hofstadter couple. Later, Sheldon reasons with her about how she made her husband (Sheldon's maternal grandfather) a better person when he was stubborn and egotistical and Meemaw soon gives her blessings to Sheldon and Amy's relationship.\n\nIn the prequel series ''[[Young Sheldon]]'', Meemaw is played by [[Annie Potts]]. In that series, it is revealed that she is Sheldon's maternal grandmother and has a compulsive gambling habit.\n\n==== Pastor Jeff ====\nJeff Difford (Matt Hobby) is a pastor at the church that Sheldon and his family attend in ''Young Sheldon''. Like Mary, he has friction with Sheldon's atheism, but he often challenges Sheldon to explore their line of thought through logic exercises. He was originally given the last name Hodgkins, but it was changed to Difford as of the episode \"Seven Deadly Sins and a Small Carl Sagan\".\n\n== Supporting characters ==\nThe following list is sorted in alphabetic order of first names.\n\n=== Cast table ===\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center; width:97%;\"\n! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:22%;\" | Character\n! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:13%;\" | Portrayed by\n! scope=\"col\" colspan=\"12\" | ''[[The Big Bang Theory]]''\n! scope=\"col\" colspan=\"3\" | ''[[Young Sheldon]]''\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:5%;\" | [[The Big Bang Theory (season 1)|1]]\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:5%;\" | [[The Big Bang Theory (season 2)|2]]\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:5%;\" | [[The Big Bang Theory (season 3)|3]]\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:5%;\" | [[The Big Bang Theory (season 4)|4]]\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:5%;\" | [[The Big Bang Theory (season 5)|5]]\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:5%;\" | [[The Big Bang Theory (season 6)|6]]\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:5%;\" | [[The Big Bang Theory (season 7)|7]]\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:5%;\" | [[The Big Bang Theory (season 8)|8]]\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:5%;\" | [[The Big Bang Theory (season 9)|9]]\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:5%;\" | [[The Big Bang Theory (season 10)|10]]\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:5%;\" | [[The Big Bang Theory (season 11)|11]]\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:5%;\" | [[The Big Bang Theory (season 12)|12]]\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:5%;\" | [[Young Sheldon#Season 1 (2017\u201318)|1]]\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:5%;\" | [[Young Sheldon#Season 2 (2018\u201319)|2]]\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:5%;\" | [[Young Sheldon#Season 3 (2018\u201319)|3]]\n|-\n| scope=''row''| [[#Kurt|Kurt]]\n| [[Brian Patrick Wade]]\n| colspan=\"2\" {{CRecurring}}\n| colspan=\"13\" {{N/a|}}\n|-\n| scope=\"row\" | [[#Eric Gablehauser|Eric Gablehauser]]\n| [[Mark Harelik]]\n| colspan=\"2\" {{CRecurring}}\n| colspan=\"13\" {{N/a|}}\n|-\n| scope=\"row\" | [[#Mrs. Wolowitz|Mrs. Wolowitz]]\n| [[Carol Ann Susi]]\n| colspan=\"8\" {{CRecurring|[[Recurring character|Recurring]], [[Voice actor|voice only]]}}\n| colspan=\"2\" {{N/a|}}\n| {{CGuest}}{{efn|name=CAS posthumous|Posthumous appearance using archived voice recording.}}\n| colspan=\"2\" {{N/a|}}\n| {{CGuest}}{{efn|name=CAS posthumous}}\n| {{N/a|}}\n|-\n| scope=\"row\" | [[#V.

a Caltech graduate student who appears in season six.  Sheldon hires her to review his kindergarten and elementary-school notebooks for any possible Nobel Prize-winning research and attend to the tasks that Sheldon perceives a waste of his own valuable time. Amy is at first jealous until she sees Alex instead flirting with an unresponsive Leonard.\n\nAfter repeated attempts by Alex, Leonard finally realizes that Alex is making advances toward him. While proclaiming his loyalty to Penny, Leonard is flattered. Sheldon interferes (with the perceived intention of mitigating a situation that needed none) by lecturing Alex, but only succeeds in insulting her. After Alex files a sexual harassment complaint, Sheldon is forced to apologize and is ordered take a university-mandated online sexual-harassment course. Because Sheldon considers his own time as too valuable to waste on it, Sheldon asks Alex to take the course instead. For Valentine's Day, Sheldon sends Alex out to buy a present for Amy, which he likes so much, he keeps.<ref>{{cite journal| url=http://www.tv.com/news/the-big-bang-theory-the-bakersfield-expedition-review-comic-book-women-30381/| last=Sleasman| first=MaryAnn| title=''The Big Bang Theory'' \"The Bakersfield Expedition\" Review: Comic Book Women| journal=[[TV.com]]| date=January 11, 2013}}</ref>\n\n<!--\n--------------------------------------------------------------\nSo far, Alfred Hofstadter appears in only two consecutive episodes. Therefore, it's hard to call this character a recurring character. Commenting out this paragraph (rather than deleting it) in case this character is brought back for additional appearances\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n==== Alfred Hofstadter ====\n[[File:Judd Hirsch - 1967.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Judd Hirsch]]]]\n\nAlfred Hofstadter ([[Judd Hirsch]]) is Leonard's father, an anthropologist who once worked with famed archaeologist [[Louis Leakey]]. He was miserable in his marriage to Leonard's mother Beverly, who was always annoying and was unmotherly towards their children. Alfred claimed she was cold and emasculating, and had not shown him any physical affection for years. On another bit, when Leonard was six, he walked in on his parents naked, and she was swatting his rear end with Leonard's brand-new ping-pong paddle. In season three, the two were revealed to be getting divorced after he had had an affair with a waitress.\n\nIn his first appearance in \"The Convergence-Convergence\" during his visit for Leonard and Penny's rewedding, he meets Mary Cooper and the two get along great as they have each other's nice, gentle, and caring personalities, bonding over their mutual dislike of Beverly, and their admiration of each other's beliefs. The two of them end up fighting with Beverly at the restaurant during the pre-ceremony dinner and the two leave together and after finding out they are staying at the same hotel, they decide to share a cab and it is implied that the two hook up.\n\nIn \"The Conjugal Conjecture\", Alfred is revealed to have not slept with Mary, but they still plan on seeing each other in the future. In the ceremony, he says that though Beverly and he do not bring the best out in each other, something wonderful did come out of their relationship: Leonard. Beverly agrees. On the way to the airport, they appear to be civil for about a minute until they start bickering over Leonard's driving.\n-->\n==== Anu ====\nAnu ([[Rati Gupta]]) is the woman who Raj's father sets him up with after asking him to arrange a marriage for him who first appears in season 12. She works in a hotel as a concierge.\n\nIn \"The Wedding Gift Wormhole\", depressed over everyone else being in a relationship, Raj asks his father to arrange a marriage for him, and sets him up with Anu. On their first date, Anu's commanding personality and practical approach to marriage startle Raj but nonetheless he agrees to go ahead with it. Howard criticizes Raj for this \u2013 he never expected Raj to just give up on romance. Raj admits this to Anu so she proposes to him, and he says yes. She meets Penny and Bernadette in \"The Tam Turbulence\", where they track her down at the hotel she works at to check her out and end up impressed by her connections in the hotel industry, although the evening turns sour when they get drunk and end up telling her embarrassing things about Raj. In \"The Consummation Deviation\", Anu wants to have sex with Raj for the first time, but he gets so nervous that his selective mutism returns. Confessing this to her, she is very understanding, revealing an unusual secret of her own: she hates music. The next morning, he is able to have sex with her in the shower. When Raj installs a doorbell camera at Anu's home, he accidentally spies on her and sees her greeting her ex-boyfriend, they realize how little they know about each other. The wedding gets cancelled, but they agree to start their relationship over by just dating. Anu later gets a job offer while working in London, and Raj considers leaving to propose to her, but Howard convinces him to wait for the right woman.\n\n==== Arthur Jeffries ====\n[[File:Comedian Bob Newhart.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Bob Newhart]]]]\n\nArthur Jeffries, or Professor Proton ([[Bob Newhart]]) is the star of a science show that Sheldon and Leonard watched as children. The character is a homage to [[Watch Mr. Wizard|Mr. Wizard]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://ew.com/article/2013/11/07/big-bang-theory-bill-nye/|title='Big Bang Theory': Bill Nye's preview|first=Erin|last=Strecker|date=November 7, 2013|publisher=[[Entertainment Weekly]]}}</ref> After the show was cancelled, Jeffries was not taken seriously as a scientist and resorted to doing children's parties as his persona. In \"The Proton Resurgence\", Sheldon hires him to do a private party for Leonard and himself (and Penny). Later, Jeffries has a heart attack as a result of climbing the apartment stairs with his equipment. He asks Sheldon to take his place at a party for a Korean family, which Sheldon agrees to do as \"Professor Proton, Jr\".\n\nWhile Sheldon idolizes him, Jeffries is constantly irritated by Sheldon's personality, and takes a shine to Penny. In \"The Proton Displacement\", Leonard, Sheldon, and Amy bump into Jeffries at a drugstore, and Sheldon becomes upset when Jeffries asks Leonard for help on a paper instead of him, and when he finds out that Jeffries thinks he is annoying, Sheldon works with [[Bill Nye the Science Guy]], whom Jeffries accuses of stealing material from his TV show. After Nye abandons Sheldon and files for a restraining order against him, Jeffries arrives at Sheldon and Leonard's apartment and asks Sheldon for his advice on his paper (although Sheldon already hacked his email account and read it for himself).\n\nIn \"The Proton Transmogrification\" on [[Star Wars Day]], Leonard tells Sheldon that Jeffries has died. Sheldon immediately pretends not to care and refuses to go to the funeral. Jeffries appears to Sheldon in a dream, where Sheldon compares him to [[Obi-Wan Kenobi]], dressing him in Jedi robes and making him appear as a Force ghost. When Sheldon asks for his wisdom, Jeffries tells Sheldon to appreciate everything in life, including his friends, and never take it for granted.\n\nJeffries returns in \"The Opening Night Excitation\" when his ghost convinces Sheldon to spend time with Amy on her birthday instead of going to see ''[[Star Wars: The Force Awakens]]'' as he had planned to do for months. After hearing Professor Proton's words, Sheldon decides to prove his devotion to Amy by finally having sex with her, as she has been hoping he will do for the past few years. Some time later, after Sheldon takes Amy to see ''The Force Awakens'', Jeffries returns to Sheldon to ask him about his first sexual experience with her, but Sheldon thinks Jeffries is talking about the film and tells him he enjoyed it.\n\nFor his role as Jeffries, in 2013, Newhart won his first [[Primetime Emmy Award]]. Newhart plays the same character on ''[[Young Sheldon]]''.\n\n==== Barry Kripke ====\n[[File:John Ross Bowie by Gage Skidmore.jpg|thumb|upright|[[John Ross Bowie]]]]\nBarry Kripke, PhD ([[John Ross Bowie]]) is a co-worker of the guys, who frequently clashes with Sheldon. He works in [[plasma physics]]. Kripke has a case of [[Rhotacism (speech impediment)|rhotacism]] in which he pronounces the letters <small>\"R\"</small> and <small>\"L\"</small> as <small>\"W\"</small> in much the same way as [[Elmer Fudd]] from ''[[Looney Tunes]]'' and [[Gilda Radner]] in her \"[[Baba Wawa]]\" sketches. In season five, Kripke purchases an [[iPhone]] with [[Siri|voice-recognition technology]], but, because of his rhotacism, the device is incapable of understanding his verbal \"wequests\", prompting him to deride it as ineffective. Until season seven, whether he was aware of his impediment was never clarified.\n\nIn his first appearance, he pits his robot, the Kripke Krippler, against the men's robot, M.O.N.T.E., in an unofficial [[Robot Fighting League|robot fight]].<ref name=\"S02E12\">{{cite episode|title=The Killer Robot Instability|episodelink=List of The Big Bang Theory episodes#ep29|series=The Big Bang Theory|serieslink=The Big Bang Theory|date=January 12, 2009|season=2|number=12}}</ref> The guys lose to Kripke, and M.O.N.T.E. is destroyed. In \"[[The Friendship Algorithm]]\", Sheldon attempts to befriend Kripke to gain access to an [[open science]] [[grid computing|grid computer]] to conduct research, but it turns out to be futile, as Kripke has no control over the computer's usage time, and Sheldon consequently expels Kripke from the group.<ref name=\"S02E13\">{{cite episode|title=The Friendship Algorithm|episodelink=List of The Big Bang Theory episodes#ep30|series=The Big Bang Theory|serieslink=The Big Bang Theory|date=January 19, 2009|season=2|number=13}}</ref> Kripke continues his antagonism towards Sheldon in \"The Vengeance Formulation\" by pulling a prank on Sheldon when he is a guest on [[NPR]]'s ''[[Science Friday]] ''by putting a helium tank in his office, making Sheldon's voice more squeaky.<ref name=\"S03E09\">{{cite episode|title=The Vengeance Formulation|episodelink=List of The Big Bang Theory episodes#ep49|series=The Big Bang Theory|serieslink=The Big Bang Theory|date=November 23, 2009|season=3|number=9}}</ref> In \"[[The Toast Derivation]]\", Sheldon tries to befriend Kripke and a few others when he is feeling excluded by his friends, but Kripke and the others all connect in a manner that Sheldon finds 'wrong' and leaves.<ref name=\"S04E17\">{{cite episode|title=The Toast Derivation|episodelink=The Toast Derivation|series=The Big Bang Theory|serieslink=The Big Bang Theory|date=February 24, 2011|season=4|number=17}}</ref>\n\nIn season five, Kripke and Sheldon [[The_Rothman_Disintegration|battle over a retired professor's office]]; but, after a long sports contest, Kripke loses to Sheldon. He is later invited to Howard's [[bachelor party]], where he uses his turn toasting to complain that no [[stripper]]s are at the party.\n\nIn season six, Kripke and Sheldon are forced to work together on a proposal involving fusion reactors, which involves an exchange of work. Sheldon is shocked to discover that Kripke's work is more advanced than his own, and he tearfully admits as much to Amy. Kripke assumes that Sheldon is in a sexual relationship with Amy and that has led to his work quality declining, and Sheldon does not deny it (although this appears to be just a convenient excuse since his work is inferior to Kripke's). Kripke also battles for tenure alongside Sheldon, Leonard, and Raj.\n\nIn season seven, Kripke ridicules Sheldon when his discovery of a new element was false, nicknaming Sheldon \"The Retractor\".\n\nIn season nine, Kripke calls Sheldon and Amy's live show ''[[Fun with Flags]]'' along with Raj and directs the conversation to irrelevant questions to the show. He also uses the show to call out for potential romantic relationships and asked Amy questions about her love life when Sheldon and she broke up. He attends Sheldon's birthday party and constantly hits on Leonard's mother, [[Beverly_Hofstadter|Beverly]].\n\n==== Bert Kibbler ====\n[[File:Brian Posehn 1.JPG|thumb|upright|[[Brian Posehn]]]]\n\nProfessor Bertram Kibbler ([[Brian Posehn]]) is a [[geologist]] at Caltech, who met Amy while she was working there in her own lab in \"The Occupation Recalibration\". Bert brings Amy interesting and beautiful rocks every day. It takes Howard and Raj to point out that he likes her. Bert then asks her to a [[rock (geology)|rock]] and [[mineral]] show, which she declines because she has a boyfriend. When Bert starts talking about how no one wants to do anything with him, Amy in a fit of sympathy agrees to go. Unfortunately, Bert is taking it as a date. Raj and Howard offer to talk to him to let him down easy, and they end up going with him to the show.\n\nBert first appeared in \"The Contractual Obligation Implementation\" where he is socially awkward and Raj meets just prior to a library date with Lucy. He tried to crash their date, and Raj sent him away. His name was not mentioned in the plot, but the closing credits gave the name Bert.\n\nIn \"The Dependence Transcendence\", Bert hosts a Caltech party that only Amy and Penny attend. He feels that Amy is the coolest girl at work and that Sheldon is cool only because he is dating Amy. As the girls are leaving, he tells them that he is in love with both of them.\n\nHe reappears in \"The Fetal Kick Catalyst\" as a guest at Sheldon and Amy's brunch in their apartment. He mentions that a girlfriend he was living with once moved out and took all his best rocks.\n\nIn \"The Geology Elevation\", Bert wins the [[MacArthur Fellows Program|MacArthur Fellowship]] grant, which makes Sheldon jealous. When Sheldon finally confronts him over this, Bert points out that the theoretical physicist has his friends and Amy to be happy about. He later accompanies Sheldon to ''[[The Ellen DeGeneres Show]]'' to make peace. His full name is shown in his award. By the end of season 10, Raj moves into the apartment over Bert's garage.\n\nBert reappears in \"The Separation Agitation\", and it is revealed that he has a recent girlfriend named Rebecca, who only appears to be with him for his grant money. After breaking up with her, Bert instantly regrets it and buys expensive gifts to win her back. At the end of the episode, he is revealed to have succeeded.\n\n==== Beverly Hofstadter ====\n[[File:ROMY 2012 04 Christine Baranski crop.JPG|thumb|upright|[[Christine Baranski]]]]\n\nBeverly Hofstadter ([[Christine Baranski]]) is Leonard's [[narcissist]]ic, unloving, and overly analytical mother. Beverly is a [[neuroscientist]], as well as a [[psychiatrist]]. She is Sheldon's female equivalent regarding neurotically strict [[Idiolect|speech pattern]]s, lack of respect for [[social convention]]s, and compulsive attention to detail. The only reason she had children was to use them as personal experiments for her research, so was very distant and unmotherly towards Leonard. Beverly mentions that Leonard's brother and sister are more successful in their respective fields than he is; though she respects this enough to keep contact with them (unlike Leonard), she is not proud, since they are not her accomplishments. One of her famous books is ''Needy Baby, Greedy Baby'', in which she describes an infant's (Leonard's) unrealistic nurturing expectations. Sheldon often refers to her books when frustrated with Leonard's attempt to obtain some of his personal needs in their relationship. Leonard sees his mother as cold and not nurturing, even telling Penny that one time he made a [[Hug machine|hugging machine]] just to get hugs (and that his father asked to borrow it). The lack of Beverly's maternal feelings and actions toward Leonard has led to him being called the \"King of [[Foreplay]]\" because of his obsessive need to please.\n\nIn her first visit, Beverly makes Penny cry by delving into her history with her father (driving her, and later Leonard, to the bottle), and considers Raj and Howard's relationship to be an \"[[ersatz]] homosexual marriage\". After bonding with Sheldon, Beverly sings [[Journey (band)|Journey's]] \"[[Any Way You Want It]]\" with him on karaoke.\n\nIn season three, Beverly comes to visit at Christmas, where she reveals that she is divorcing her husband, Alfred, after she caught him in bed with another woman. Despite Leonard's reluctance to tell Beverly about his and Penny's relationship, Penny takes her to the Cheesecake Factory for a round of drinks and reveals their relationship. After Beverly gropes a [[busboy]], she and Penny both go to [[Del Taco]] and then return to Leonard and Sheldon's apartment where she confronts Leonard on not telling him about Penny, and then is confronted by him for not being a loving and caring mother for him. After Beverly tries to show motherly affection by hugging Leonard, she kisses a shocked Sheldon and leaves. The next morning, a hungover Beverly gives her blessing to Leonard and Penny's relationship and vows not to reveal her drunken kiss with Sheldon, wanting to work instead on her maternal relationship with Leonard.\n\nIn season five, Sheldon calls Beverly on Skype to help Leonard following Penny and Raj's hook-up, and she tells Leonard to \"buck up, sissypants...If you need any more help from me, my books are available on [[Amazon.com|Amazon]]\".\n\nIn season seven, Leonard uses Beverly's latest book to get sympathy from Penny. However, Bernadette finds out from Howard what Leonard is doing and tells Penny, who calls Beverly, leaving a briefly pantsless Leonard to chat with his mother on [[Skype]]. Leonard later informs his mother of his engagement to Penny, but she reveals that Sheldon already told her. She decides to accept his engagement with Penny because Sheldon likes her.\n\nIn season eight, Beverly comes to visit to see Leonard receive an award, where she meets Sheldon's mother, Mary. The mothers get into an argument after Beverly describes Mary's religious beliefs as a superstition, and Mary, in turn, berates Beverly for her cold and distant attitude towards Leonard. Beverly later reflects with Sheldon that perhaps other ways exist to raise children than she did. The mothers make up and Beverly tries to show affection by hugging Leonard, though it is awkward for both of them.\n\nIn season nine, she attends Sheldon's birthday party and enjoys a proposition from Barry Kripke. Later, she returns for a visit to interview people for her new book, and spends her time bonding with Amy and Bernadette, frustrating Penny's attempts to bond with her. When Penny confronts her for this, she admits that she feels insulted about not being invited to her son's wedding. Penny suggests doing a second wedding ceremony for her, which she accepts and the two finally bond. She is unhappy about her ex-husband, Alfred, attending since their marriage ended due to his affair, and is even angrier when Alfred and Mary Cooper display mutual attraction and leave the rehearsal dinner together. Beverly and Alfred argue all night and Beverly once again quarrels with Mary. At the ceremony, she agrees with Alfred that Leonard was the best thing to come out of their relationship.\n\nIn season 11, Beverly begins talking to Penny as a friend and confidant, troubling Leonard, especially when he learns that Beverly told Penny that she is proud of her, a level of praise she never bestowed upon Leonard himself. When Leonard confronts Beverly, he is touched when she says that of all of her children's spouses, Penny is the one she is most impressed by, and that for this, she is indeed proud of him.\n\nShe reappeared in \"The Novelization Correlation\" as the character Ilsa from Leonard's book, as well as appearing over Skype.\n\nIn season 12, she appeared in \"The VCR Illumination\" via video chat when Leonard and Penny talked to her about comforting Sheldon. She reappeared in the seventeenth episode, \"The Conference Valuation\".\n\nIn \"The Maternal Conclusion\", Beverly visits Leonard and Penny acting nice and truly interested in Leonard's new physics project. Later she admits that she is doing research for a new book which makes Leonard blow up. Finally he forgives her which makes both of them feel much better and they end in a true loving embrace.\n\nFor her role as Beverly, in both 2009 and 2010, Baranski was nominated for an [[Emmy Award]] for [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Guest Actress in a Comedy Series|Outstanding Guest Actress in a Comedy Series]].\n\n==== Claire ====\n[[File:AlessandraTorresaniApr09.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Alessandra Torresani]]]]\n\nClaire ([[Alessandra Torresani]]) is a writer for a children's science fiction series whom Raj and Howard meet in the comic book store in season 9. Claire wants to collaborate with Raj on the science portions of a movie script. When Raj reveals to her that he has a girlfriend, Emily, she assures him that she is only interested in his technical assistance, and they can still meet as friends. However, Raj develops visions of marriage and children with Claire. After Raj breaks up with Emily, he calls Claire on Valentine's Day, only to learn that she has just got back together with her boyfriend. She also calls Raj an \"ass\" for breaking up with Emily just before Valentine's Day. Later, however, she asks Raj out for a drink after she has again broken up with her boyfriend. However, Raj is on his way to reunite with Emily, and chooses to be with her. However, Raj later starts seeing Claire again while at the same time dating Emily. She and Raj continue to date, but they keep their relationship casual with no commitment. When she meets Raj's friends, Claire begins to realize that Raj has been dating multiple women, and successfully tricks him into admitting it.\n\nIn season 10, Raj reveals that he is now single, having broken up with both Emily and Claire at the ladies' behest. Later in the season, when Raj tries to figure out what is wrong with himself, Claire accepts an invitation to Raj's apartment, where she meets his previous girlfriends. Claire reveals that she broke up with Raj after finding him too needy and vain and declares that she is now in a better relationship.\n\n==== Dan ====\n[[File:StephenRootFeb09.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Stephen Root]]]]\n\nDan ([[Stephen Root]]) is a senior member of staff at Zangen, who first appears in \"The Locomotion Interruption\" when he interviews Penny for a pharmaceutical sales representative position as a favor to Bernadette. Penny realizes that the interview is not going well so she ends it and starts to leave. As a favor, she asks Dan not to tell Bernadette how badly she did because she is kind of scared of her. Dan says that he thought he was the only one who was scared of her. They start to bond, agreeing that Bernadette is something of a bully. Dan comments that she has that squeaky little voice, and that everyone else thinks she is SO nice. He had to cut one of Bernadette's research programs, but was too scared of her to do it. Dan and Penny both agree not to tell Bernadette about the results of the interview. Later Bernadette is talking to Howard at home, and tells him that it is hard to believe, but Penny got the job. She feels that it is because Dan really loves her.\n\nDan reappears in \"The Champagne Reflection\", when Penny makes Bernadette face up to her bullying ways. Dan is still afraid of Bernadette, and tells the story of how she yelled at him and his grandson after they lost the three-legged race at the company picnic. His grandson called her the mean kid with the big boobies. Bernadette is horrified when she realizes how everyone perceives her. Her father had taught her to be tough and she can be cruel with some of her comments without even knowing it. She says she thought she was the sweetest person she knew, and should be in a tree baking cookies like a [[Keebler Company|Keebler]] elf. She goes to apologize to Dan and discovers that, owing to everyone's fear of her, they have been paying for her daily coffee even after the company stopped doing so (something they accomplished with a swear jar kept for Bernadette's sake); and have given her the private use of a toilet that was meant for everyone. She now feels like she has to leave the company and starts crying. Desperate for her to stop, Dan promises to keep paying for her coffee, and even offers to get her an [[espresso machine]]. Bernadette has found a new way to get what she wants.\n\n==== Dave Gibbs ====\n[[File:StephenMerchantAltNov09.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Stephen Merchant]]]]\n\nDave Gibbs ([[Stephen Merchant]]) is a tall British man who dates Amy after she breaks up with Sheldon. Dave is recently divorced because his wife left him for a French chef. When her friends try to find Amy a date on a dating [[Smartphone application|mobile app]], they see a text message from Dave, and Amy reveals they have already gone out together for coffee. Sheldon is about to propose to Amy for closure when he sees Amy and Dave share a kiss after their date. When Amy and Dave later go out again for dinner (while Penny, Bernadette, and a reluctant Leonard spy on them), he shows an unusual fascination with Sheldon, which discomforts Amy. He considers Sheldon and Leonard to be physics superstars and idolizes them. He later gets an opportunity to meet Leonard and shake his hand after Leonard has to relieve himself while spying on their date, and with great excitement, Dave announces that he will never again wash his hand. After Sheldon rejects Amy's proposal that they be a couple again, Amy once again tries dinner with Dave, who goes out of his way to refrain from mentioning Sheldon, knowing how uncomfortable that subject made her previously. Sheldon then suddenly arrives and professes his love to Amy, and the two mend their relationship, leaving Dave to awkwardly excuse himself and invite Sheldon to meet again on his way out.\n\n==== Denise ====\n[[File:Lapkus.JPG|thumb|upright|[[Lauren Lapkus]]]]\n\nDenise ([[Lauren Lapkus]]) is the assistant manager at Stuart's comic book store introduced in [[The Big Bang Theory (season 10)|season 10]]. She is quite a comic book geek. At first, Sheldon doesn't like the change that her hiring brings to the store, but starts to like her because of her comic book knowledge and her ability to figure out his preferences in comic books. After being annoyed by Sheldon's praising of Denise, Amy goes down to the bookstore to demand that Denise teach her enough about comics to make it appear that she likes them.  In \"The Bow Tie Asymmetry\", Stuart asks her to come to Sheldon and Amy's Wedding with him. Denise declines until she learns that Star Wars actor Mark Hamill is going to be there. She sits besides Stuart at the wedding and watches as he answers questions about Star Wars better than Mark Hamill. Denise is amazed by his knowledge and calls him hot. A relationship starts between Denise and Stuart in \"The Wedding Gift Wormhole\". They spend time together and enjoyed each other's company though Stuart is insecure about their relationship. Denise invites Stuart to move in, but he backs off not wanting to ruin their relationship. In episode twenty-two of season 12, \"The Maternal Conclusion\", they move in together after convincing Denise's creepy roommate Mitch to move out.\n\n==== Eric Gablehauser ====\nEric Gablehauser ([[Mark Harelik]]) is the head of the Physics Department, the group's boss at the university. When he first starts working at the university, he fires Sheldon after Sheldon insults his intelligence. Eventually, Gablehauser rehires Sheldon after he and Sheldon's mother display a mutual romantic interest. Gablehauser later hosts the Physics Bowl,<ref name=\"S01E13\">{{Cite episode|title=The Bat Jar Conjecture|episodelink=List of The Big Bang Theory episodes#ep13|series=The Big Bang Theory|serieslink=The Big Bang Theory|date=April 21, 2008|season=1|number=13}}</ref> and gives Raj attention when he is featured in a [[People Magazine|''People'']] article for discovering [[Planet Bollywood|a planet]].\n\n==== V. M. Koothrappali ====\n[[File:Brian George CFC (cropped).jpg|thumb|upright|[[Brian George]]]]\n\nV. M. Koothrappali ([[Brian George]]) is Raj's father in India. His wife and he communicate with their son via Skype and constantly try to arrange dates for him. They want their son to marry a woman of Indian descent, and give them grandchildren.<ref name=\"S01E08\" /> Although in many episodes Raj mentions that he grew up in poverty, his friends remind him of the contrary by pointing out that Dr. Koothrappali is a [[gynecologist]], drives a [[Bentley]], and employs servants.<ref name=\"S02E04\"/> In one such episode, Raj replies that the Bentley is leased and there are only four servants in his family home, two of whom are [[child labour|children]]. Dr. Koothrappali enjoys ''[[Doogie Howser, M.D.|Doogie Howser]]'' reruns, which are apparently new to India.<ref name=\"S01E08\">{{Cite episode|title=The Grasshopper Experiment|episodelink=List of The Big Bang Theory episodes#ep8|series=The Big Bang Theory|serieslink=The Big Bang Theory|date=November 12, 2007|season=1|number=8}}</ref><ref name=\"S02E04\">{{Cite episode|title=The Griffin Equivalency|episodelink=List of The Big Bang Theory episodes#ep21|series=The Big Bang Theory|serieslink=The Big Bang Theory|date=October 13, 2008|season=2|number=4}}</ref> Other than Raj, he also maintains contact with their daughter Priya via Skype whenever she is out of India. In season four, Dr. Koothrappali becomes angry with Leonard when he learns that his daughter, Priya, is dating Leonard without his knowledge. According to Sheldon, the Koothrappalis are \"[[Richie Rich (comics)|Richie Rich]] rich\".\n\nThe Koothrappalis go through a rough patch in their marriage, culminating in them separating in season eight around the time of their 40th wedding anniversary, with Dr. Koothrappali moving out and Mrs. Koothrappali setting fire to his car. Dr. Koothrappali makes his first physical appearance on the show in season eight, visiting the main characters at a Christmas party after the divorce. Dr. Koothrappali later cuts off Raj financially when he buys a helicopter drone, but Raj manages to turn the situation around by pitting his father against his mother. He also asks his father to give advice to a nervous, pregnant Bernadette.\n\nIn \"The Allowance Evaporation\", Raj after meeting his ex-girlfriends who said he was too spoiled and a momma's boy, tells his father that he was no longer taking any money from him. His father was delighted that his last only unmarried offspring was going to stand on his own two feet.\n\nIn \"The Wedding Gift Wormhole\", it's revealed that he is dating again and decides to set up Raj with a woman for an arranged marriage. \n\nHe returns in \"The Propagation Proposition\" via video chat after Raj broke up with Anu and was angry about any money he lost due to the wedding being cancelled.\n\n==== Mrs. Koothrappali ====\n[[File:Alice Amter and Jos\u00e9 Yenque.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Alice Amter]] (left)]]\n\nMrs. Koothrappali ([[Alice Amter]]) is Raj's mother in India. Mrs. Koothrappali is especially worried that, despite Raj being old enough to marry, the closest they have to a daughter-in-law is \"that little Jewish boy Howard\".<ref name=\"S03E06\">{{cite episode|title=The Cornhusker Vortex|episodelink=List of The Big Bang Theory episodes#46|series=The Big Bang Theory|serieslink=The Big Bang Theory|date=November 2, 2009|season=3|number=6}}</ref> She enjoys ''[[Doogie Howser, M.D.|Doogie Howser]]'' reruns, which are apparently new to India.<ref name=\"S01E08\" /><ref name=\"S02E04\" /> Other than Raj, she also maintains contact with Priya via video chat whenever she is out of India. She also had some anger towards Leonard when it became apparent that he was dating Priya without her knowledge.\n\nFollowing their divorce in season eight, Raj mentions that his mother bought the book ''[[Eat, Pray, Love]]'' and used it to set fire to her ex-husband's car. Mrs. Koothrappali makes her first physical appearance on the show in \"The Graduation Transmission\", where Raj uses the Koothrappali's divorce to get money from her when his father cuts him off financially, and pits her against her ex-husband.\n\n==== Janine Davis ====\n[[File:Regina King 2010.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Regina King]]]]\n\nJanine Davis ([[Regina King]]) is a human resources representative working at the university. She first appears in season six after Sheldon offends his assistant Alex while trying to solve a problem regarding her crush on Leonard, leaving Mrs. Davis to handle Alex's sexual-harassment complaint against Sheldon. Sheldon tells Mrs. Davis his belief that she, like all women, is a \"slave\" to her sexual \"urges\", unaware that his remarks are racist and sexist. In his attempt at defense, Sheldon rats out what he considers similar behavior by Raj, Howard, and Leonard, prompting Mrs. Davis to summon them to her office, as well. Mrs. Davis later serves on the [[Academic tenure|tenure]] committee that is considering Raj, Sheldon, Leonard, and Kripke for a vacant tenured position, causing each of them to try to win her favor. Sheldon, in his effort to earn the position, offends her once again by giving her the box set for the miniseries [[Roots (1977 miniseries)|''Roots'']]. Despite this, Sheldon is still short-listed for tenure, even if he offends Mrs. Davis yet again by giving her what he thinks is a traditional handshake originating in African American communities.\n\nIn season seven, Mrs. Davis says that she is recently divorced because her husband cheated on her, and Raj attempts to strike up a conversation with her at a university mixer. After offending her, Raj apologizes, and the two talk about their troubles. Following the mixer, while Raj is insistent that Mrs. Davis and he had a \"moment\", Howard disagrees. Mrs. Davis makes another appearance in season 8, where she informs Sheldon that he has to teach a class as a junior professor, and in season 11, has to deal with Leonard after he gives an embarrassing interview on the radio about the university.\n\n==== Kurt ====\nKurt ([[Brian Patrick Wade]]) is a tall, intimidating bodybuilder and Penny's ex-boyfriend at the beginning of the series. In the pilot, Penny reveals that he cheated on her, and Leonard and Sheldon later go to his apartment and attempt to retrieve Penny's television set from him, but they were unsuccessful and Kurt apparently found them so irritating that they returned home [[Debagging|without pants]].<ref name=\"S01E01\">{{Cite episode|title=Pilot|episodelink=List of The Big Bang Theory episodes#ep1|series=The Big Bang Theory|serieslink=The Big Bang Theory|date=September 24, 2007|season=1|number=1}}</ref> Kurt is invited to Penny's Halloween party, for which he dresses up as a caveman, where he has yet another run in with Leonard, who is dressed as a [[hobbit]]. After Kurt sees Penny kissing Leonard, Leonard victoriously shouts to him, \"That's right, you saw what you saw.

After Leonard learns about Penny's problems, he tries to help her cut expenses, and in the process learns that Kurt owes her $1800. Without telling Penny, Leonard and the guys go to Kurt's place to collect the money, but they are unsuccessful, and Kurt writes \"I owe Penny $1800 ~ Kurt\" on Leonard's forehead in indelible ink. Later, Penny reveals that Kurt visited her the next morning and paid her, in turn. However, much to Leonard's disappointment, Kurt never told Penny about Leonard's visit, and instead took the opportunity to ask Penny out for dinner.<ref name=\"S02E14\">{{Cite episode|title=The Financial Permeability|episodelink=List of The Big Bang Theory episodes#ep31|series=The Big Bang Theory|serieslink=The Big Bang Theory|date=February 2, 2009|season=2|number=14}}</ref> However, the date apparently does not go anywhere as Kurt is never seen or mentioned again.\n\n==== Lucy ====\n[[File:Kate Miccuci GFDL cropped 2.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Kate Micucci]]]]\n\nLucy ([[Kate Micucci]]) shows up at a party at the comic-book store on Valentine's Day at an event for people who had no dates. She has social anxiety issues, which allows Raj and her to connect. On their first date, she becomes so nervous that she goes to the bathroom and climbs out of the window to get away. Raj falls apart and refuses to leave his apartment; however, after apologizing to him, Lucy and Raj start afresh. Raj and Lucy have a date at a library and communicate by text messages, and at the end, she offers to kiss him, but chickens out at the last second. In \"The Bon Voyage Reaction\", Raj tries to introduce Lucy to the rest of the gang. Lucy becomes nervous at the thought of meeting so many new people that Raj suggests she meet just one of his friends first, to which she agrees. Lucy meets Amy, but Raj pressures Lucy and upsets her. Lucy breaks up with Raj by an email, and afterwards a heartbroken Raj finally speaks to Penny without having consumed alcohol. Originally, Kate Micucci had been one of the actresses considered for the Amy Farrah Fowler character.\n\nIn season seven, Penny meets Lucy at the Cheesecake Factory and confronts her about her breakup with Raj, and later Lucy arranges to meet with Raj to apologize to him for breaking up with him via email. This leads Raj to believe the two of them will get back together, but Lucy tells him she is with someone else. Although she is not seen, Lucy later texts Raj saying that she misses him and wants to get back together, but after finding out that he is also dating Emily, Lucy rebuffs Raj.\n\nLucy appears in season 10, where Raj invites her to his apartment along with his other ex-girlfriends to find out why he is still single. Lucy mentions that she is now in a better relationship.\n\n==== Mike Rostenkowski ====\nMike Rostenkowski ([[Casey Sander]]) is Bernadette's father and a tough retired police officer. Mike has a rough and rude personality and often bullies others, although he deeply loves his daughter, calling Bernadette his \"little girl\". Before he is first seen, Bernadette establishes his personality by telling Howard a long list of subjects he cannot discuss with Mike, including [[Jimmy Carter]], foreigners, homosexuals, and even Howard's Jewish identity.\n\nIn his first appearance, he tells Howard that, while he does not think highly of him, his respect for Howard grew when he learned he had been selected to become an astronaut. However, after Howard expresses his fears about not returning from space, Mike tells him not to worry as Bernadette will have no trouble finding another suitable bachelor if Howard dies in space, much to the future astronaut's dismay. In the season-five finale, Mike attends Howard and Bernadette's wedding and walks his daughter down the aisle.\n\nIn season six, Howard and Mike are pushed into a fishing weekend by their spouses, but neither man really wants to go. Mike suggests that they go to a casino to shoot craps. Having earned more of Mike's respect, Howard is now able to address him as \"Mike\" rather than \"Sir\".\n\nIn season seven, because his wife is out of town, Bernadette gets Mike to come to Howard's mother's house for Thanksgiving dinner, though he would rather watch football at home. Since Sheldon understands football from growing up with his father, Mike and Sheldon bond and drink heavily together. After insulting Howard, Mike later tells Howard that he is not \"all that bad\", but implies that this statement is untrue when he comments on his drunken state. In \"The Table Polarization\", Mike, Bernadette, Raj, and Mike Massimino (via Skype) perform an intervention on Howard's decision to go back to space. Mike mentions that Howard asked him to shoot him in the foot to avoid the first space mission, which Howard insists was a joke.\n\nIn season nine, he comes to Howard and Bernadette's house since they are talking about renovating and he comes over to help. While Howard and he are busy under the foundations of the house, Mike asks Howard why he does not want kids, but Howard sets things straight when he tells Mike that it is actually Bernadette who does not want kids. In the room above, Bernadette overhears this and tries to drown out the conversation by yelling \"Earthquake!\" and drumming her feet on the floor, causing a dust avalanche on both of them. Bernadette had lied to her father about not wanting kids because she did not want to disappoint him. Mike says he does not want to see her miss out since raising children was the most rewarding experience of his life, but Bernadette points out that her mother did everything while all Mike did was come home from work, sit on the couch, and drink beer, which is unrelated to raising kids. Defeated, Mike leaves, saying this is really a conversation for husband and wife and tells Bernadette if her mother asks, he was at the Wolowitz house until 10. He briefly comes back into the kitchen and sees Howard and Bernadette doing \"dirty talk\" and then disappears again through the doorway.\n\n==== President Siebert ====\n[[File:Joshua Malina 2013.JPG|thumb|upright|[[Joshua Malina]]]]\n\nPresident Siebert ([[Joshua Malina]]) is the [[California_Institute_of_Technology#Presidents|president]] of the [[California Institute of Technology]]. He is married and has a daughter. Siebert is often mentioned by Sheldon. A recurring gag is that Sheldon often calls or visits Siebert in the middle of the night to get information, and usually gets a bitter response. Siebert sends Sheldon on the expedition to the North Pole at the end of season two.\n\nIn his first appearance, Siebert organizes a get-together with wealthy donors and faculty members to garner funds for the university's programs. He urges the guys to make an appearance to schmooze the donors so they will give to their projects. Seeing Sheldon's behavior toward the donors, he asks that he not appear again.\n\nIn season five, Siebert forces Sheldon to use up his vacation days, and when Sheldon and Kripke [[The Rothman Disintegration|battle for an office]] at the university, they interrupt Siebert at a urinal to get him to make a decision on who gets the office.\n\nIn season eleven, the President returns and is very excited about Sheldon and Amy's asymmetry string theory paper. He helps them promote it and submitting a Nobel Prize nominations for the two of them.\n\n==== Priya Koothrappali ====\nPriya Koothrappali ([[Aarti Mann]]) is Raj's younger sister. Having graduated at the top of her class at the [[University of Cambridge]] (where like Leonard, her roommate was from Texas), she is one of the lead attorneys at India's biggest car company.\n\nIn her first appearance, Priya has a two-day layover and comes to visit her brother. Leonard and she are revealed to have had a relationship five years earlier (without her parents' or Raj's knowledge) when she was in town, and that Leonard had been much more invested in the relationship than she was. Leonard even offered to relocate to New Delhi to be with her. He tries to keep their relationship a secret from the guys, but Sheldon discovers Priya in their apartment after spending the night together. Leonard eventually reveals to the rest of the guys that he spent the night with Priya, as he is unable to bear the burden of keeping the secret.<ref>{{cite episode|title=The Irish Pub Formulation|episodelink=The Big Bang Theory (season 4)#ep69|series=The Big Bang Theory|serieslink=The Big Bang Theory|network=[[CBS]]|date=October 28, 2010|season=4|number=6|minutes=}}</ref> Priya returns to Los Angeles for business in \"The Cohabitation Formulation\", and Leonard and she decide to try to have a real relationship, over the protests of Raj. It upsets both Raj, knowing that his sister is having sex with one of his best friends (sometimes in Raj's bed), and Penny, who is revealed to harbour unresolved feelings for Leonard. Priya soon becomes jealous of Penny and asks Leonard to stop spending time with her, which causes Penny, Amy, and Bernadette to hate her. Priya contests Sheldon's roommate agreement with Leonard, employing her legal background to deny Sheldon power over him, but upon Amy's advice, Sheldon drafts a new agreement and blackmails Leonard into signing it by threatening to tell Priya's parents she is dating Leonard, which she cannot bear because they want her to date an Indian (although her father would accept her dating Howard due to his belief that Jews are financially savvy and do not drink much). At the end of season four, Leonard overhears her parents claiming that she is moving back to India, which he interprets as the end of their relationship, leading him to expose their secret relationship to her parents.\n\nIn season five, although they are separated, with Priya moving back a month earlier than expected, they nonetheless remain in touch via Skype, having a cyber-dinner/breakfast date. At Howard's suggestion, Leonard and Priya also attempt to simulate intercourse, but when it comes time for her to remove her clothing, Leonard's screen freezes up because of his exceeding the bandwidth. Leonard later manages to get cue cards to help himself with a seduction speech to Priya, but while delivering it to her, he inadvertently reveals to her parents that they are cyber-dating (they were in the same room as she when he called), with them acidly asking for him to continue with the speech.<ref name=\"s05e02\">{{cite episode|title=The Infestation Hypothesis|episodelink=The Infestation Hypothesis|series=The Big Bang Theory|serieslink=The Big Bang Theory|network=[[CBS]]|date=September 22, 2011|season=5|number=2|minutes=}}</ref> In \"The Good Guy Fluctiation\", Leonard tells Priya about his attraction to a comic-book enthusiast named Alice; Priya admits to cheating on him with her former boyfriend, which visibly upsets Leonard.

In the next episode, Leonard refers to himself as single, indicating that Priya and he have broken up as a result of their last conversation.\n\nIn season 10, it is mentioned that out of the six Koothrappali children, only Raj is still single, indicating that Priya has married since her last appearance.\n\n==== Ramona Nowitzki ====\n[[File:Riki Lindhome by Gage Skidmore.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Riki Lindhome]]]]\n\nRamona Nowitzki, Ph.D., ([[Riki Lindhome]]) first appears in the season 2 episode, \"The Cooper\u2013Nowitzki Theorem\", when she is a graduate student at Caltech who is a huge fan of Sheldon's work and develops a near-obsessive crush on him. She meets Sheldon personally in the cafeteria and arranges to have dinner with him in his apartment. Where other people might be worried about such behavior being reminiscent of stalking, Sheldon reacts positively to Ramona by appreciating the fact that he is getting a free dinner. During their date, the rest of the gang is sitting on the couch as spectators of this strange turn of events. She keeps \"helping\" Sheldon by arranging suitable working conditions for him, such as getting breakfast for him at the cafeteria and giving him foot rubs. Unfortunately for Sheldon, she overdoes her insistence that Sheldon dedicate his time solely for work, depriving him of his favorite hobbies such as playing games, watching TV, and going for paintball with the guys. Even more unfortunately for Sheldon, he cannot seem to get rid of her, especially when she settles herself in his apartment. Ramona proves to be irritating for the entire group, especially when she assumes that Penny likes Sheldon. She still asks Penny to be sisters with her. She makes it difficult for anyone to communicate with him and scares them away. Eventually, Sheldon solves the problem he has been working on. Enthusiastic about his solution, he asks Ramona how he can reward her for all her help. But when she asks for him to share credit with her and name the theorem \"Cooper-Nowitzki\", he finally kicks her out of the apartment.\n\nRamona reappears in the season 10 finale. She now has her Ph.D., and has secured a post-doc position at Caltech. Amy is away at [[Princeton University|Princeton]], and the gang becomes worried for Sheldon because Ramona's crush on him begins again. She brings him meals, and eventually kisses him in his office. Finally aware of her advances, Sheldon makes an excuse to leave the office, and promptly flies to New Jersey where he proposes to Amy.\n\nIn the first episode of season 11, Amy shocks Ramona by hugging her, as it was Ramona's advances that prompted Sheldon to propose.\n\n==== Ruchi ====\nRuchi (Swati Kapila); is a new co-worker of Bernadette's at Zangen who first appears in season 11. Ruchi used to live in India, and was in an arranged engagement, until she broke off the engagement and moved to America.\n\nIn her first appearance, Bernadette takes Ruchi out for drinks, though despite Howard's suggestion, refuses to set her up with Raj or Stuart. While out for drinks, Raj and Stuart show up uninvited (after Howard told them where they were) and both take an interest in Ruchi and try to win her over. Raj invites Ruchi out for drinks behind Stuart's back in a bid to get her alone. When Stuart shows up and later throws Raj under the bus, she tells them that she is not interested in dating anybody right now and just wants to make some friends. Raj later bumps into Ruchi at a bar while watching a cricket match with Howard and they eventually hook up. Afterwards, Ruchi wants to keep things casual with Raj, which he has difficult maintaining, especially after a date with her when she reveals that she does not believe in soul mates and sees romantic love more as a bio-chemical reaction. Despite this, Raj continues to see Ruchi to have sex with her. While she is on bed rest, Bernadette becomes convinced that Ruchi is trying to steal her job and asks Raj to investigate her suspicions. After revealing to Raj she is taking over all of Bernadette's projects, Raj tells Bernadette and tries to defend Ruchi like a boyfriend would, pointing out Bernadette's hypocrisy as she would most likely have stolen from other people's projects as well. When she finds out about this, Ruchi is not happy and promptly dumps Raj.\n<!--\n--------------------------------------------------------------\nSo far, Stephanie Barnett appears in only three consecutive episodes.

Stephanie uses sex to manipulate Leonard when he tries to slow down the relationship. After much hesitation, Leonard texts her at the university and tells her to move out because he is uncomfortable with the pace of the relationship, although he apparently leaves to have sex with her.

Wil played [[Wesley Crusher]] in ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation]]'', a character that Sheldon idolized as a child. In 1995 Wheaton made Sheldon's \"mortal enemy\" list after Wheaton failed to show up at a fan convention. Sheldon took a 10-hour bus ride to attend the convention and was disappointed that Wheaton was a no-show.\n\nIn season three, Sheldon enters a trading-card game tournament (''Mystic Warlords of Ka'a'') to confront Wheaton. When Sheldon is about to defeat his hated rival, Wheaton tells him that he missed the 1995 \"Dixie Trek\" convention because his grandmother had died. In sympathy, Sheldon deliberately messes up his next move to benefit Wheaton. Wheaton reveals that he lied about his grandmother and then wins the game by taking advantage of the opening Sheldon leaves him. Wheaton later plays in a bowling match against Sheldon, where he uses [[gamesmanship]] again, breaking up Leonard and Penny to win.\n\nIn season four, Wheaton appears at a special screening of ''[[Raiders of the Lost Ark]]'' and uses his celebrity status to go to the front of a long line. This antagonizes Sheldon, who derides him as the \"[[Jar Jar Binks]] of the Star Trek universe\". Wheaton and his entourage effectively prevented Sheldon and his friends from attending the screening when the last seat in the theater went to the person directly in front of them in line. Ultimately, Sheldon steals the reels containing the prints of the film and Wheaton leads a mob of angry audience members after Sheldon.\n\nIn season five, Wheaton invites the guys to a party at his house and appears to be genuinely sorry for his past actions, giving Sheldon a signed Wesley Crusher action figure as a way of thanking Sheldon for being a fan. His gesture is met with a renunciation of his \"mortal enemy\" status and a hug from Sheldon. Wheaton is invited to Howard's bachelor party, where he films the toasts and uploads them to the Internet, getting Howard and Raj in trouble with Bernadette.\n\nIn season six, Wheaton appears in a ''Star Trek''-themed episode of Sheldon's web-series ''[[Fun with Flags]]'' and insults Amy after she criticizes his performance. After Sheldon ditches Amy to spend time with Wheaton, Amy becomes angry with Sheldon, who later unknowingly becomes intoxicated and almost starts a fist fight with Wheaton, demanding an apology.\n\nIn season seven, Amy calls Wheaton to cheer up Sheldon after Leonard disproves Sheldon's scientific discovery. Wheaton later gives Penny advice when she wrestles with whether to take a role in the sequel to a low-budget horror film in which she once starred. After taking the role, Penny finds that Wheaton is also appearing in the film. Wheaton and Penny are both fired from the film after an argument with the director.\n\nIn season eight, Wheaton invites Penny to appear on his [[podcast]], where she talks about her acting career. Leonard and Penny get into an argument on air, much to the amusement of Wheaton.\n\nIn season nine, Wheaton introduces [[Adam Nimoy]], son of Mr. Spock portrayer [[Leonard Nimoy]], to Sheldon, for Sheldon to be interviewed for a documentary that Adam Nimoy is producing about Spock and his impact on popular culture. In a later episode, Wheaton fills in for Sheldon when he joins Leonard, Howard, and Raj for the midnight premiere of ''[[Star Wars: The Force Awakens]]''. When he arrives at the theater, the audience immediately jeers him for dressing as Spock, but Wheaton explains that he did so intentionally because he believes the audience should not take whether the film succeeds or fails so seriously. He appears again to celebrate Sheldon's birthday in the show's 200th episode, \"The Celebration Experimentation\".\n\nIn season eleven, Sheldon wants to replace [[List of The Big Bang Theory characters#Arthur Jeffries|Arthur Jeffries]] in the role of Professor Proton, following Jeffries' death, and asks Wheaton to be his acting coach for the part. However, when Wheaton somehow gets the part instead, Sheldon is dismayed and after many unsuccessful attempts to get his friends to boycott the franchise, he demands that Wheaton turn down the role. Wheaton refuses, claiming he wants to inspire young scientists and Sheldon begins to consider him an enemy again. However, after watching the show Sheldon likes Wheaton's portrayal of Prof. Proton and gets jealous when he sees that Wheaton has brought Howard to be a guest on his show. Although Sheldon apologizes to Wheaton, mending their friendship, Wheaton refuses to bring Sheldon as a guest on his show and instead invites Amy to be a guest on the show. At the end of season eleven, Wil is Sheldon and Amy's first choice to officiate their wedding ceremony, but is replaced when [[Mark Hamill]] becomes available.\n\nIn season twelve episode \"[[The D&D Vortex]]\", Wheaton as Professor Proton invites Sheldon to meet [[William Shatner]], and Sheldon gets so excited that he then proceeds to throw up on him. When Sheldon shows up at Wheaton's house to apologize, Wheaton accepts the apology, but as he is in the middle of a private [[Dungeons & Dragons]] game featuring [[William Shatner]], [[Kareem Abdul-Jabbar]], [[Kevin Smith]], [[Joe Manganiello]] and Stuart, he shuts Sheldon out. When the guys find out about the game, they get Stuart to quit and Wheaton invites Leonard, asking him not to tell anyone. Leonard then tells Penny and she tells Amy and Bernadette; the girls stalk Wheaton in an attempt to get themselves invited when they hear that Manganiello from [[Magic Mike]] will be there. Because of that indiscretion, Wil kicks out Leonard and admonishes the guys for using him for his connections, and says that one of the worst things about being a celebrity is not knowing whether someone will like him for himself. To apologize, the guys invite Wil to play D&D with them at Leonard's apartment, but Wil, secretly in the middle of a game with Penny, Amy and Bernadette and the group, politely turns them down but offers to arrange for another time. Penny sits next to Shatner telling him he tells \"Grandpa Jokes\" and Bernadette tells Abdul-Jabbar how she and her father used to watch him, while Amy creeps out Manganiello and is moved away from him. Wheaton then allows them all to take a photo together and send it to the guys as payback, which Leonard himself admits they all deserved.\n\nWil Wheaton, [[LeVar Burton]], Leonard Nimoy (in voice-over only), [[Brent Spiner]], [[William Shatner]] and [[George Takei]] have all appeared on the show, making the ''Star Trek'' franchise the most represented franchise on the show in terms of guest appearances.\n\n==== Marissa Johnson ====\nMarissa Johnson ([[Lindsey Kraft]]) is married to Penny's ex-boyfriend, [[#Zack Johnson|Zack Johnson]]. They meet with Leonard and Penny and they want Leonard to father their child since Zack is infertile.\n\n==== Mrs. Wolowitz ====\nMrs. Debbie<ref>{{cite episode|title=The Status Quo Combustion|episodelink=The Big Bang Theory (season 7)#ep79|series=The Big Bang Theory|serieslink=The Big Bang Theory|network=[[CBS]]|date=May 15, 2014|season=7|number=24|minutes=20:01}}</ref> Malvina<ref>{{cite episode|title=The Birthday Synchronicity|series=The Big Bang Theory|network=[[CBS]]|date=December 15, 2016|season=10|number=11}}</ref> Wolowitz (voiced by [[Carol Ann Susi]]) is Howard's over-protective, controlling, belittling, but loving and caring [[Jewish mother stereotype|stereotypical Jewish mother]]. The character is [[Unseen character|not shown on-screen]] with the exception of [[The Big Bang Theory (season 6)#ep126|one episode in season six]] in which her body, but not face, is briefly shown. Mrs. Wolowitz's raspy voice is heard usually in scenes at her house, which she shares with Howard. She talks to Howard always by yelling at him from another room, which results in awkward conversations with Howard yelling back at her. In a flashback, when the guys hear her yelling in a masculine voice, they ask Howard if that was his father, to which Howard replies, \"If she grows any more hair on her face, yes\".\n\nMrs. Wolowitz is also described as being enormously obese and wearing a wig and painted-on eyebrows. She seems to be oblivious to Howard's work as an engineer and treats him as though he is still a child. She is a master at Wheel of Fortune and guessing answers at game shows. She frequently refers to Leonard, Sheldon, and Raj as Howard's \"little friends\" (as in, \"I made some cookies and Hawaiian Punch for you and your little friends!\") and often refers to Caltech as a \"school\". Howard often makes references to his mother as being a \"crazy old lady\", but deep down, he is deeply attached to his mother and quite happy to be treated like a child. She is also noted to be on [[hormone replacement therapy]], and she wants to \"[[Playing doctor|play doctor]]\" with Raj when he asks to sleep over.\n\nWhen Howard reveals that he has proposed to Bernadette and she has accepted, she collapses, causing Howard to panic and dislocate his shoulder while trying to barge into the bathroom to help her. The timing leads him to believe that she may not like Bernadette (who is Catholic) and has suffered a heart attack from the shock of the news. In actuality, her fainting was due to food poisoning from the food she ate while meeting Bernadette and was completely unrelated to Howard's news. She has graciously accepted Bernadette as her daughter-in-law and is impressed by Bernadette's doctorate.\n\nIn an early episode, Howard attempts to move out after a fight with his mother, but has serious delusions that she is trying to force him to stay, when in actuality, she is urging him to move out, which leads to him staying. However, at the beginning of season six, she is so angry and upset about Howard moving in with Bernadette that she cries at the thought of being lonely, prompting him to promise he'll convince Bernadette to move into their house instead. However, Bernadette remains firm but once Howard has finally moved out of his mother's house, he tells her a story about inviting his mother to be an assistant during his magic tricks as a child, helping her forget her loneliness, making Bernadette feel guilty and decide that she and Howard should sleep over at his mother's house from time to time to remind her that she is not alone. Later in the season, Howard asks Raj to look in on his mother to make sure she is okay while he and Bernadette are out on a trip. Raj enjoys dinner with her but as he is about to leave, she cries at being lonely, causing a sympathetic Raj to stay for dessert. He ends up sleeping in Howard's old bedroom, but once Howard warns him that his mother will use her loneliness and mother him in a desperate attempt to make him stay, he attempts to escape but is caught by her.\n\nIn season seven, Mrs. Wolowitz breaks her leg and keeps driving away the nurses hired to care for her. Even Penny rejects the job of caregiver after a very short time. After Stuart's comic-book store burns down, Howard invites Stuart to work for Mrs. Wolowitz; however, they develop a strange relationship, much to Howard's annoyance. Howard is also upset about the fact that now she dotes more heavily on Stuart, getting him premium cable, new clothes, money to rebuild the comic book store and even recording an answering machine message with him.\n\nFollowing the death of Carol Ann Susi, producers decided that Mrs. Wolowitz would die in the season-eight episode \"The Comic Book Store Regeneration\". Howard receives a phone call while in the store from his aunt Gladys in Florida, whom Mrs. Wolowitz had gone to visit. She says that Mrs. Wolowitz lay down for a nap and never woke up afterwards. Howard and Bernadette then move back into Howard's old home, and Stuart decides to stay with them. He eventually moves out halfway through season nine, allowing them to redecorate. Mrs. Wolowitz is also in the season-eleven episode \u201cThe Bitcoin Entanglement\u201d.\n\n==== Wyatt ====\n[[File:Aspettando Clint Keith Carradine fcm.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Keith Carradine]]]]\n\nWyatt ([[Keith Carradine]]) is Penny's father. He comes to visit, and Penny feels compelled to involve Leonard in a ruse to make him think they are still together. (Wyatt reveals that he favors the successful Leonard over Penny's other \"loser\" boyfriends.) When the plot is revealed, he gets mad at Penny and feigns anger at Leonard, but after Penny leaves the room, he encourages Leonard to keep trying to get Penny back (because he wants his grandchildren to \"grow up in a house without wheels\"). Strangely, though, in the first episode where Leonard's mother visits, Penny tearfully reveals her rough childhood, saying that Wyatt wanted a boy and even called her \"slugger\" until she reached puberty. Wyatt appears again in season nine, when Penny finally plucks up the courage to tell her father she eloped with Leonard. Wyatt is happy, but he also confesses that he killed Penny's pet pig a year ago. In the season 10 premiere, \"The Conjugal Conjecture\", he comes to Pasadena with his wife and son to attend Leonard and Penny's re-wedding and during the ceremony he walks Penny down the aisle, welcomes Leonard to their family and advises him not to lend Penny's brother any money.\n\n==== Zack Johnson ====\nZack Johnson ([[Brian Thomas Smith]]) is a dim-witted but friendly [[beefcake]]-type whom Penny dates on and off after her second break-up with Leonard. Zack works as the menu designer for restaurants that are owned by or which have hired his father's company to design their menus.\n\nIn season three, Leonard invites Penny and Zack up to the roof to watch his experiment of bouncing laser beams off the moon; Zack misunderstands what is happening, and thinks they are going to blow up the moon.<ref name=\"S03E23\">{{Cite episode|title=The Lunar Excitation|episodelink=List of The Big Bang Theory episodes#ep63|series=The Big Bang Theory|serieslink=The Big Bang Theory|date=May 24, 2010|season=3|number=23}}</ref> Later, Penny and Zach go out to a party, but she is so put off at how stupid he is that she runs back to Leonard for sex, saying he ruined her ability to tolerate stupid men.\n\nIn season four, Zack runs into Penny, Bernadette, and Amy at a restaurant, and Amy becomes physically attracted to him. Sheldon arranges a meeting between Zack and Amy to satisfy her \"urges\", but his lack of intellect immediately discourages Amy. Unlike Penny's other boyfriends, Zack considers Leonard, Howard, Sheldon, and Raj (whom he calls \"the science dudes\") to be \"cool\" and makes a genuine effort to get to know them, even treating them as his friends. After accompanying them on a trip to the comic-book store (where Raj and he bond over a mutual fondness for ''[[Archie Comics|Archie]]'' comics), he enters a New Year's Eve costume party with them, portraying [[Superman]] in their version of the [[Justice League]]. In \"The Toast Derivation\", Sheldon invites him over for a party, where he bonds with Kripke and Stuart, as well.\n\nIn season seven, it is discovered that Zack and Penny have been unknowingly married for three years after the two were intoxicated and attended a wedding chapel in [[Las Vegas]] (they were not aware that weddings in Las Vegas are real). Penny invites him to Mrs. Wolowitz's house for [[Thanksgiving]], where they get the marriage annulled.\n\nIn season nine, episode 22, Zack's observations indicate he is, in some respects, more observant and smarter than \"the science dudes\".\n\nIn season ten, episode 22, Zack and his fianc\u00e9e, Sarah, plan a double date with Penny and Leonard, but Sarah does not turn up. Zack offers Penny a job at his menu printing company which she accepts, but when she calls Zack he tells her that Sarah is uncomfortable with them working together.\n\nIn season eleven, episode 9, it is revealed that seven years prior, Penny gave Zack Leonard's old laptop, which Leonard had given her while they were dating. Penny and Leonard arrive at Zack's apartment to retrieve the laptop, where he shows them that Penny had made a video she intended to send to Leonard apologizing for their break-up.\n\nIn season twelve, episode 12, Penny runs into Zack again after he buys her, Bernadette and Amy drinks. He reveals that he has sold his menu company and become rich from the profits, and invites her and Leonard to dinner at his yacht with him and his new wife, [[#Marissa Johnson|Marissa Johnson]]. Penny and Leonard proceed to make fun of the newlyweds on how dumb they are until Zack and Marissa ask Leonard to be their sperm donor in hopes of conceiving a child. Because Penny said that she never wants children, Penny and Leonard argue about the situation, but eventually Penny agrees to support whatever decision Leonard makes. In season twelve, episode 15, Leonard ultimately cannot go through with it and tells Zack to ask Sheldon, whom declines after Amy is outraged at the idea.\n\n=== ''Young Sheldon'' supporting characters ===\n==== Billy Sparks ====\nBilly Sparks (Wyatt McLure) is a boy who lives with his parents and sister next to the Coopers and Meemaw. He has been mentioned in ''The Big Bang Theory'' as one of Sheldon's childhood bullies, although in ''Young Sheldon'' he is rather good-natured and at times is friends with Sheldon, but is shown to be extremely dim-witted and simple-minded.\n\n==== Brenda Sparks ====\nBilly Sparks's mother who works at the bowling alley frequented by Meemaw. She is not a very pleasant person and often clashes with Mary.\n\n==== Dale Ballard ====\nCoach Dale Ballard ([[Craig T. Nelson]]) is a baseball coach who lets Missy play after he says no and Meemaw intervenes. He also ends up dating Meemaw after her breakup with Dr. Sturgis.\n\n==== Dr. John Sturgis ====\nDr. John Sturgis ([[Wallace Shawn]]) is a physics professor at the university East Texas Tech that Sheldon attends part-time. Dr. Sturgis is initially a pen pal of Sheldon Cooper, before the child prodigy audits his {{w|quantum chromodynamics}} course. Dr. Sturgis is instantly smitten with Sheldon's Meemaw and they begin dating, much to Sheldon's approval, but also to Sheldon's urging.\n\nHe is also rather childish like going to bed at 7:30 and asking Meemaw's permission to do things as if she were his mother.\n\n==== Herschel Sparks ====\nHerschel Sparks ([[Billy Gardell]]) is a neighbor of the Cooper family and Meemaw, the husband of Brenda Sparks, and the father of Billy and Bobbi Sparks. He runs his own garage, where he offers Georgie a part-time job. Georgie turns out to be a wonderful employee, something that makes George and Herschel happy and stunned. Herschel is often bossed around by his wife, something that he and George bond over since George is often bossed around by Mary as well.\n\n==== Paige ====\nPaige ([[Mckenna Grace]]) is a 10-year-old child prodigy whom Sheldon meets in one of his classes with Dr. Sturgis. She turns out to be a bit smarter than him and this causes Dr. Sturgis to pay attention a lot to her, something that makes Sheldon jealous, so Meemaw has to step in. Unlike Sheldon, she is very sweet, has excellent social skills, and is capable of being friends with non-intellectuals, as is reflected in her friendship with Missy.\n\n==== Tam Nguyen ====\nTam Nguyen (Ryan Phuong \u2013 YS / [[Robert Wu]] \u2013 TBBT) is a Vietnamese-American boy who, in ''Young Sheldon'', is Sheldon's classmate and only friend. His father Le Nguyen, and mother Trang Nguyen, run a store called \"Medford Mart\". He has two sisters, Mai and Kim-Ly. \n\nTam laments his difficult childhood in war-torn Vietnam, which included his father being incarcerated in a detention camp, and his encounter with the [[Ku Klux Klan]] when he first arrived in America. Tam takes his frustration out on other people, such as Sheldon's father George. He has a troubled relationship with his parents, having been treated badly by both of them after moving to the United States. The episode \"A Loaf of Bread and a Grand Old Flag\" suggests that Tam has a good relationship with his sisters, as he talks about starting a [[labor union]] with them and taking their parents to court.\n\nBy the time of ''The Big Bang Theory'', Sheldon and Tam are no longer friends. In the Season 12 episode \"The Tam Turbulence\", they met up again after not speaking in 20 years. When Leonard, Howard and Raj find out about Tam, having never previously heard of him, they try to meet him. They do so at Caltech, assuming that Sheldon was to blame for the end of the friendship. It turns out that when Sheldon was moving to California he had asked Tam to move there with him; Tam agreed, but after meeting a girl named Beth decided to stay in Texas instead. He and Beth married soon after and had one son and at least one other child.\n\nSheldon and Tam make up at the end of episode with Tam saying that he has been happy with Beth and their children all these years and has had a very happy life overall, in contrast to his abusive childhood.\n\n==== Veronica Duncan ====\nVeronica Duncan ([[Isabel May]]) is Georgie Cooper's most significant love interest on ''Young Sheldon''. \n\nInitially introduced as a popular and \"easy\" girl, Veronica becomes a devout Christian after going through a \"[[Seven Deadly Sins|Sin]] [[Haunted attraction (simulated)|House]]\" one Halloween. Georgie is obsessed with her and frequently takes every advantage he can to be close to her or impress her in any way, such as agreeing to be baptized with her (only to attempt \u2013 comically and painfully unsuccessfully \u2013 to steal a kiss), defend her against an abusive step-parent (after Mary had taken her in), or coming up with a series of get-rich-quick schemes to buy her expensive gifts (which she rejects, though she seems more receptive towards a bracelet made of the candy he was selling in his latest scheme).\n\n== Minor characters ==\n[[File:Judd Hirsch (edited).jpg|thumb|Judd Hirsch]]\n* Dr. Alfred Hofstadter ([[Judd Hirsch]]): Leonard's father, an anthropologist who once worked with famed archaeologist [[Louis Leakey]] (Leonard's middle name is Leakey in consequence). He was miserable in his marriage to Leonard's mother Beverly, who was always annoying and was unmotherly towards their children. Alfred claimed she was cold and emasculating, and had not shown him any physical affection for years. When Leonard was six, he walked in on his parents naked, and she was swatting his rear end with Leonard's brand-new ping-pong paddle, and as a result in season three, the two were revealed to be getting divorced after he had had an affair with a waitress. In his first appearance in \"The Convergence-Convergence\" during his visit for Leonard and Penny's rewedding, he meets Mary Cooper and the two get along great as they have each other's nice, gentle, and caring personalities, bonding over their mutual dislike of Beverly, and their admiration of each other's beliefs. The two of them end up fighting with Beverly at the restaurant during the pre-ceremony dinner and the two leave together and after finding out they are staying at the same hotel, they decide to share a cab and it is implied that the two hook up. In \"The Conjugal Conjecture\", Alfred is revealed to have not slept with Mary, but they still plan on seeing each other in the future. In the ceremony, he says that though Beverly and he do not bring the best out in each other, something wonderful did come out of their relationship: Leonard. Beverly agrees. On the way to the airport, they appear to be civil for about a minute until they start bickering over Leonard's driving.\n* {{visible anchor|Althea Robinson}} ([[Vernee Watson-Johnson|Vernee Watson]]): makes an appearance in [[Pilot (The Big Bang Theory)|the pilot episode]] as an attendant at a [[sperm bank]], and then makes three appearances as an emergency room nurse in \"[[The Peanut Reaction]]\" episode (season one) and \"[[The Big Bang Theory (season 4)#ep64|The Robotic Manipulation]]\" episode (season four), and as a ward nurse in \"[[The Big Bang Theory (season 5)#ep105|The Werewolf Transformation]]\" (season five). The name of the character is never used on the show, but is included on her name tag and in the credits. She is also the only character besides Leonard and Sheldon to be carried over from the original unaired pilot. Watson also portrays a younger version of Robinson in several episodes of ''[[Young Sheldon]]''.\n* Dr. Stephanie Barnett ([[Sara Rue]]): a medical doctor and a highly distinguished surgeon that Howard tries to seduce, but she falls for Leonard. She dates Leonard, and surreptitiously moves in with him. Once Sheldon and Penny point this out to him, Leonard breaks up with her.\n* Captain Sweatpants (Ian Scott Rudolph) and Lonely Larry (Owen Thayer): are sometimes seen at the guys' favorite comic-book store. Captain Sweatpants is a middle-aged bald man who wears grey sweatpants and a T-shirt with [[Captain America]]'s shield. Lonely Larry wears a brown suit and is extremely thin. They are also friends with Wil Wheaton. Both attend Howard's bachelor party.\n* Cheryl (Erin Allin O'Reilly), an attendee at Penny's Halloween party in season one, episode six, \"The Middle Earth Paradigm\".

She shares a birthday with Amy. Halley's appearances are hidden by her baby pram and covered up by blankets, though her loud cries from off-screen sound a lot like Mrs. Wolowitz (a tribute to [[Carol Ann Susi]]). In the series finale, she finally made an onscreen appearance and she resembles her mother.\n* Neil Michael Wolowitz, Howard and Bernadette's baby son, born in the episode \"[[The Neonatal Nomenclature]]\". Hours before his birth, Howard is unhappy that Bernadette has already decided to name the baby after her father, Michael, without consulting him first. He doesn't agree with this and is even more disturbed that many of the names he has thought of come from her ex-boyfriends in college. Eventually Howard and Bernadette compromise as she gives birth to Neil, after Neil Armstrong and Neil Diamond, with Michael as the middle name. Bernadette still wants to call the baby Michael as a nickname, and Howard doesn't argue with her because of the baby's large head. In his only onscreen appearance in the series finale he resembles his father.\n\n== Guest stars ==\n<!-- Please only submit notable guest appearances; notable actors who made appearances on the show for 2 episodes or less.-->\n\n[[File:Jane Kaczmarek.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Jane Kaczmarek]]]]\n* Abby ([[Danica McKellar]]) and Martha ([[Jen Drohan]]): two ladies that Raj and Sheldon meet at a university [[cocktail party|mixer]].

Originally from [[New Jersey]], he received his PhD at age 24, spending at least some of his time at [[Princeton University]]. He shared an apartment in [[Pasadena, California|Pasadena]] with colleague and friend Dr. Sheldon Cooper until season 9. Unlike his equally geeky friends, Leonard is interested and adept in building relationships with other people. Compared to his friends, he is relatively successful with women.\n\nThe writers have toyed with a romance between him and next-door neighbor Penny since the series premiere, with their unresolved sexual tension being a major force for drama. Leonard dated Penny for most of season three. Following his break-up with Penny, Leonard began a relationship with Raj's sister Priya in season four. The two attempted a long-distance relationship after Priya moved back to [[India]], but Leonard broke up with her in season five after she admitted to cheating on him. In season five's \"The Recombination Hypothesis\", Leonard and Penny start dating again.\n\nIn season six's \"The 43 Peculiarity\", Penny tells him she loves him for the first time. Over the next two years, they talk about marriage and each have unsuccessful proposals until the penultimate episode of season seven, when they become engaged. They get married in the ninth-season premiere, followed by a wedding redo for their friends and families since the couple had eloped. In the series finale \"The Stockholm Syndrome\", it is revealed that they are expecting their first child.\n\nLeonard's family includes other accomplished scientists: his mother, Dr. Beverly Hofstadter, is a [[neuroscientist]] and world-renowned [[psychiatrist]], his sister is a [[medical research]]er, and his father, Dr. Alfred Hofstadter, is an [[anthropologist]]. Also, his brother Michael is a Harvard law professor.\n\n==== Sheldon ====\n{{main|Sheldon Cooper}}\n[[File:Jim Parsons at PaleyFest 2013.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Jim Parsons]]]]\n\nSheldon Lee Cooper ([[Jim Parsons]]) is a [[Theoretical physics|theoretical physicist]], possessing a [[Bachelor of Science|BS]], [[Master of Science|MS]], [[Doctor of Philosophy|PhD]], [[Doctor of Science|Sc.D.]], and an [[Intelligence quotient|IQ]] of 187. Born in [[East Texas]], he was a [[child prodigy]], and received his PhD at age 16 from [[California Institute of Technology|Caltech]]. He is often cold, self-centered, condescending, and immature, but is not intentionally hurtful: his conduct is generally well-intentioned, but poorly judged. He has a softer side, as he does care about his friends, and loves his family and wife Amy Farrah Fowler, though he often insults them either about their intellect levels or different opinions. In seasons 1\u20139, he shares an apartment in [[Pasadena, California|Pasadena]] with friend and fellow physicist Dr. Leonard Hofstadter.\n\nHe has a deep love and interest for science fiction and comic books, to the point of an obsession, and shows particular affinity for [[Spock]] from the ''[[Star Trek]]'' franchise. He refrains from any form of physical contact and exhibits a strict adherence to routines to the point of exhibiting signs of [[obsessive\u2013compulsive personality disorder]]. Any disruption to routines distresses him enormously. A running gag has him always knocking on doors in a pattern of three knocks and one call repeated three times. In the interests of making life run on rational and predictable lines, he requires Leonard to sign a legalistic and exhaustive \"Roommate Agreement\", and later imposes a similar \"Relationship Agreement\" on Amy.\n\nSheldon has trouble in social settings. His commitment to his friends is often called into question, as he is known for being constantly and consistently, if unintentionally, condescending and rude. He also has difficulties lying or keeping a secret, giving himself away with wild facial tics and implausible statements. He is, however, fond of occasionally telling a joke or playing a prank, which he typically punctuates with his trademark exclamation \"Bazinga!\" He has a [[superiority complex]] and makes no effort to hide his contempt for other people's lower intellects, often making highly inappropriate comments.\n\nSheldon meets Amy Farrah Fowler in the third-season finale and starts a slowly evolving relationship with her. In the tenth season, the two move in together for a five-week experiment to test their compatibility and later decide to make the arrangement permanent. At the end of that same season, admirer Ramona Nowitzki makes a romantic overture to Sheldon, prompting him to propose to Amy. In the finale of season eleven, Sheldon and Amy get married. In the series finale, Sheldon and Amy jointly share [[Nobel Prize in Physics|the Nobel Prize in Physics]] for their work on Super-Asymmetry.\n\n==== Penny ====\n<!-- NOTE: Do not add \"Hofstadter\". Leave as the common name that is used, which is just \"Penny\".

SEE THAT IT IS NOTED AT THE END OF THIS SECTION. -->, is Leonard and Sheldon's neighbor across the hallway. Originally from a small town outside [[Omaha, Nebraska]], she was a waitress and occasional bartender at the local [[The Cheesecake Factory|Cheesecake Factory]] until season seven, and is an aspiring actress. According to Sheldon, she is a \"good-natured simpleton\". She is kind-hearted, outgoing, and does display the most common sense out of all the original five main characters. She also appears to be the most street-smart. Her lack of educational qualifications (she dropped out of community college) are a constant source of disparaging comments from Sheldon.\n\nShe has dated several men during the course of the series, including Kurt, Stuart, and Zack, but her recurring romantic interest is Leonard. Leonard pursued Penny during season one and they dated briefly at the start of season two, which led to some awkwardness. They began dating again and were a couple for most of season three, but she ended the relationship after he told her he loved her and she was not ready to reciprocate. Penny and Leonard begin to date again during the fifth season. After several unsuccessful proposals from both sides, Penny realizes that her happiness is derived from her relationship with Leonard and they become engaged and later elope, upsetting their friends and families and leading to a wedding redo with their friends and families present. In the series finale \"The Stockholm Syndrome\", it is revealed that Penny is pregnant with her and Leonard's first child. She has a tense relationship with Sheldon, whose nerdy and obstinate personality often exasperates her, but they are ultimately good friends, helping each other in various situations. By season four, Penny also begins to socialize more with Bernadette and Amy, who frequently visit Penny's apartment, go out together, and comfort each other.\n\nAt the start of season eight, Penny pursues a career in pharmaceuticals and interviews for a job at Bernadette's workplace. She gets the job, and gradually becomes more independent, including earning a higher salary than Leonard. She reveals in season nine that she is not happy with her job, but insists on keeping it to help her eliminate her former credit card debts and secure a good financial future. In season 10, Leonard and Penny are finally living alone in apartment 4A after Sheldon moves in with Amy. In the series finale \"The Stockholm Syndrome\", it is revealed that they are expecting their first child. \n\nInitially, not much is known about Penny's family, but it is mentioned in the series that her father, Wyatt (portrayed by [[Keith Carradine]],<ref name=\"S04E9\">{{cite episode|title=The Boyfriend Complexity|series=The Big Bang Theory|episodelink=The Big Bang Theory (season 4)#ep72|serieslink=The Big Bang Theory|date=November 18, 2010|season=4|number=9|minutes=3:30}}</ref>) raised her like a boy, her mother smoked marijuana while she was pregnant with her, her sister shot her husband while they were intoxicated, and her brother is a [[Methamphetamine|meth]] dealer. Her mother, Susan ([[Katey Sagal]]), and brother, Randall ([[Jack McBrayer]]), are finally seen in the first episode of [[The Big Bang Theory (season 10)|season ten]].\n\n==== Howard ====\n{{main|Howard Wolowitz}}\n[[File:Simon Helberg at PaleyFest 2013.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Simon Helberg]]]]\n\nHoward Joel<ref name=\"S04E7\">{{cite episode|title=The Apology Insufficiency|series=The Big Bang Theory|episodelink=The Big Bang Theory (season 4)#ep70|serieslink=The Big Bang Theory|date=November 4, 2010|season=4|number=7|minutes=12:50}}</ref> Wolowitz, [[Master of Engineering|M.Eng.]] ([[Simon Helberg]]) is an [[aerospace engineer]] at Caltech's Department of [[Applied physics|Applied Physics]], who often hangs out at Leonard and Sheldon's apartment. Unlike Sheldon, Leonard, and Raj, Howard does not have a doctorate, and often gets disparaged as a result, especially by Sheldon. He defends this by pointing out that he has a master's degree in Engineering from [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]] and that the equipment he designs is launched into space, unlike the theoretical work of his friends. In the fifth-season finale, Howard goes to the [[International Space Station]] on [[Expedition 31]].\n\nHoward lives in [[Altadena, California|Altadena]] with his domineering, belittling, and unseen mother, who treats him like a child. While he sometimes expresses irritation at this treatment, for the most part, he appears to prefer it.<ref name=\"S06E7\">{{cite episode|title=The Habitation Configuration|series=The Big Bang Theory|episodelink=The Big Bang Theory (season 6)#ep118|serieslink=The Big Bang Theory|date=November 8, 2012|season=6|number=7}}</ref> Howard dotes on his mother and participates in many of her daily routines. A recurring gimmick in the series is Howard and his mother communicating with each other from different rooms by yelling, a habit which Bernadette also adopts in later episodes. His father left them when he was 11, and Howard gets visibly distressed when the subject comes up. Howard fancies himself a ladies' man and attempts [[pick-up line]]s whenever a woman is present, although he drops this habit once he starts going out with Bernadette. He is Jewish, but is not serious about his faith, and does not keep [[Kashrut|kosher]]. However, he does observe the [[Shabbat|Sabbath]] and the [[Jewish holidays]].\n\nIn the pilot episode, he speaks English, French, Mandarin, Russian, Arabic, and Persian, along with fictional languages like [[Klingon language|Klingon]] and [[Sindarin]]. Howard suffers from asthma, transient idiopathic arrhythmia, [[Peanut allergy|allergies to peanuts]], almonds, and walnuts, and is prone to canker sores and pink eye. Howard dated Bernadette briefly in season three. After some difficulties, they resumed their relationship in season four, which culminated in their engagement. In the fifth-season finale, Howard and Bernadette are married on the roof of the apartment building shortly before he has to leave for Kazakhstan, where he is to be sent to the International Space Station. In season six, he finally leaves his mother's house and moves into Bernadette's apartment.<ref name=\"S05E24\">{{cite episode|title=The Countdown Reflection|series=The Big Bang Theory|episodelink=The Big Bang Theory (season 5)#ep111|serieslink=The Big Bang Theory|date=May 10, 2012|season=5|number=24}}</ref> In the episode \"The Comic Book Store Regeneration\", Howard's mother passes away in her sleep while in Florida, prompting him to move back into his home with Bernadette. Stuart, the owner of the guys' favorite comic book store, also moves in.\n\nUpon learning that Bernadette is pregnant in season nine, Howard panics about handling the impending baby, particularly earning enough money. With the help of his friends, he designs a new form of guidance system that attracts the attention of the [[United States Air Force|Air Force]]. In \"The Birthday Synchronicity\", Bernadette gives birth to a girl named Halley, on Amy's birthday, who screams like Howard's late mother, Debbie Wolowitz.\n\nIn season 11, Howard learns that Bernadette is pregnant again and later in the same season in \"The Neonatal Nomenclature\", Bernadette gives birth to a boy named Neil Michael Wolowitz.\n\n==== Raj ====\n{{main|Raj Koothrappali}}\n[[File:Kunal Nayyar at PaleyFest 2013.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Kunal Nayyar]]]]\n\nRajesh Ramayan<ref name=\"S02E21\">{{cite episode|title=The Vegas Renormalization|series=The Big Bang Theory|episodelink=The Big Bang Theory (season 2)#ep38|serieslink=The Big Bang Theory|date=April 27, 2009|season=2|number=21|minutes=9:42}}</ref><ref name=\"S03E12\">{{cite episode|title=The Psychic Vortex|series=The Big Bang Theory|episodelink=The Big Bang Theory (season 3)#ep52|serieslink=The Big Bang Theory|date=January 11, 2010|season=3|number=12|minutes=8:25}}</ref> Koothrappali, [[Doctor of Philosophy|PhD]] ([[Kunal Nayyar]]) is Howard Wolowitz's best friend and another genius of the group. His name is usually shortened to \"Raj\". He is from [[New Delhi]], [[India]], and works in the physics department at Caltech, where his area of expertise is [[astroparticle physics]]. He lives in an apartment in Pasadena. As with his friends, he is mutually involved with and obsessed with science fiction and comic books in general. He is also a [[Harry Potter fandom|fan of Harry Potter]] and [[Music of India|Indian music]], but appreciates the Indian lullabies his mother sang and the catchiness of [[Hindi]] phrases. Raj is a [[Hindu]] and believes in [[karma]] ([[reincarnation]]), but eats beef. He is very shy around women outside of his family, and during the first six seasons of the show, found himself [[selective mutism|unable to speak to women while in their presence]] unless he drank [[alcoholic drink|alcoholic beverages]], or [[Placebo|believed he had done so]].<ref name=\"S01E08\"/> When Penny, Amy, and Bernadette were around, Raj usually whispered what he wanted to say to Howard or Leonard, who then repeated or responded to what Raj said aloud. Despite this, Raj has sometimes ended up in bed with women, leaving the other characters perplexed.<ref>{{cite episode|title=The Middle Earth Paradigm|series=The Big Bang Theory|episodelink=The Big Bang Theory (season 1)#ep6|serieslink=The Big Bang Theory|date=October 29, 2007|season=1|number=6}}</ref>\n\nUnlike his friends, Raj has many feminine interests, such as reading ''[[Archie Comics|Archie]]'' comics and ''[[Twilight (Meyer novel)|Twilight]]'' and watching [[chick flick]]s such as ''[[Bridget Jones's Diary (film)|Bridget Jones's Diary]]''. A recurring joke in the series has people, including his parents and Leonard's mother, speculating that Raj might be [[Homosexuality|gay]] due to his feminine interests and his close friendship with Howard, with whom he has arguments similar to those of a married couple. However, Raj has always stated that he is [[Heterosexuality|straight]], but [[metrosexual]]. He had an infatuation with Penny, and secretly wrote love poems about Bernadette. Raj comes from a very wealthy family in India, and often communicates with his parents, Dr. and Mrs. Koothrappali, via webcam.<ref name=\"S01E08\"/> He has a younger sister, Priya.\n\nIn season six, Raj started seeing a shy and sweet woman named Lucy, who had many things in common with Raj. However, she feels too pressured when he asks her to meet his friends and breaks up with him. As of season seven, he no longer requires alcohol, drugs, or medication to speak in front of women. In season seven, Raj starts dating Emily Sweeney, a dermatologist, and their relationship becomes exclusive at the end of the seventh season. In the ninth season, he meets a bartender/scriptwriter and dates her along with Emily. However, in season ten, he mentions he is currently single. After his parents divorced, Raj's father ended his financial support and he was forced to move into Leonard and Penny's apartment. Due to friction between them, Raj moved into an apartment over Bert's garage. After starting to live on his own and learning to manage his own finances, Raj has finally started to work at the Observatory where his expertise is more highlighted. In the final season, Raj's father arranges a marriage for him with an Indian hotel concierge named Anu. They breakup when she take a job in London.\n\n==== Leslie Winkle ====\n[[File:Sara Gilbert.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Sara Gilbert]]]]\n\nLeslie Winkle, PhD ([[Sara Gilbert]]) is an experimental physicist who works in the same lab as Leonard. In appearance, she is essentially Leonard's female counterpart, equipped with the black-framed glasses and sweat jackets. She also has a [[Amblyopia|lazy eye]]. Leslie had [[casual sex]]ual relationships with both Leonard and Howard, considering it a completely physical reaction to her body's cycles. She is one of Sheldon's arch-enemies, due to their conflicting scientific theories.\n\nSara Gilbert made her first appearance in the [[The Big Bang Theory (season 1)#ep3|third episode]] of [[The Big Bang Theory (season 1)|season one]] and her final appearance as a regular in the [[The Big Bang Theory (season 3)|third-season]] finale. ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' reported in January 2009 that she had been downgraded from starring status to recurring because the producers of the series were unable to come up with new storylines for the character.<ref>{{cite journal |first=Michael |last=Ausiello |title=''Big Bang Theory'' scoop: Sara Gilbert taken off contract |url=http://www.ew.com/article/2009/01/23/big-bang-theory |journal=Entertainment Weekly |date=January 23, 2009 |accessdate=November 5, 2016}}</ref> She returned for a guest role in the 200th episode, \"[[The Celebration Experimentation]]\", in season nine, with her character talking briefly about how she and Sheldon have changed over the years and affectionately calls him \"dumbass\" again at Sheldon's insistence (due to his [[Sheldon Cooper#Personality|dislike for change]]).\n\n==== Bernadette ====\n<!-- NOTE: Please leave the heading of this section as \"Bernadette\", the name by which she is commonly known, and credited in episodes and press releases.

She is a smart, short-tempered, ruthless, and often competitive young woman who sometimes displays a sweet, nice, and friendly personality. Despite her squeaky voice, she has a darker side. A recurring joke in the series references Bernadette and her lab team handling dangerous or infectious specimens, leading to accidental byproducts or exposure to diseases, in some cases resulting in Bernadette being quarantined.\n\nBernadette is of [[Poland|Polish]] origin and [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] upbringing, and was originally seen wearing a cross necklace. She frequently [[psychological manipulation|manipulates]] people, often pretending to be a friendly and good-natured individual, quickly making friends with Penny and Amy, as well as the rest of the gang. Despite her short stature, she is regarded as being somewhat intimidating, largely because of her sharp tongue, aggressive demeanor, and occasional signs of mania. In season eight's \"The Locomotion Interruption\", Penny interviews for a pharmaceutical sales representative position with Bernadette's boss, and secures it because she concurs with his opinion that Bernadette is kind of a bully and that they are slightly terrified of her.\n\nPenny first introduced Bernadette to Howard on Leonard's request. During their first date, Bernadette and Howard do not find any common field of interest until they discover that they both have domineering mothers. After their third date, Bernadette declares that three dates is the threshold for deciding whether they want a long-term relationship. Blindsided, Howard hesitates initially, causing a temporary rift between them, but then impulsively proposes marriage to show her that he does care about her. Frustrated, she declines, but when he sings a heartfelt song for her at the Cheesecake Factory, she declares that it is the most romantic thing anyone has ever done for her and their relationship continues. A lengthy offscreen breakup occurs when she catches Howard engaging in [[cybersex]], but Howard apologizes and their relationship resumes.\n\nIn her initial appearances in the third season, Bernadette does not use her high-pitched speaking voice and is portrayed as almost a dim-witted blonde by taking things literally and not understanding even the simplest of ideas. She mentions this fact in season four's \"The Alien Parasite Hypothesis\", where she says she is much smarter than Howard, but in order to protect his manhood, she acted dumber.\n{{anchor|Zangen}}\nIn the fourth season finale, she obtains her doctorate and is subsequently hired by a pharmaceutical company (Zangen) that offers her a high salary. While preparing for their wedding in the fifth season, Bernadette is shocked and repulsed when she learns about Howard's past sexual escapades, although once again, an apology and reconciliation occurs in the same episode. They marry the day before Howard leaves for his upcoming mission to the [[International Space Station]].\n\nDuring seasons six and seven, the newlyweds deal with Howard's difficulty in readjusting to life on Earth, the struggle to keep a healthy relationship with Howard's mother, and arguments over money. In the ninth-season episode, \"The Valentino Submergence\", Bernadette reveals that she is pregnant, informing Howard in the next episode. She comically reveals that the baby was conceived in Sheldon's bed, much to Sheldon's chagrin. Raj learns about the baby's gender and inadvertently reveals that the child is a girl. In \"The Birthday Synchronicity\" Bernadette gives birth to a girl named Halley who screams like the baby's late grandmother, [[Debbie Wolowitz]].\n\nIn season 11, Bernadette learns that she is again pregnant, while Howard is telling her Sheldon and Amy got engaged. Her doctor puts her on six-months bed rest, which makes her fond of watching detective and criminal-themed TV shows. In \"The Neonatal Nomenclature\" Bernadette gives birth to a boy named Neil Michael Wolowitz (Neil for Armstong, Gaiman and Diamond and Michael for Bernadette's father), but she insists that she and Howard call him by his middle name Michael. In season 12, Bernadette pushes Penny in her sales career.\n\n==== Amy ====\n{{main|Amy Farrah Fowler}}\n[[File:Mayim Bialik, March 2018 (4116) (cropped).jpg|thumb|upright|[[Mayim Bialik]]]]\nAmy Farrah Fowler<!-- Do not change this to \"Cooper\". Amy has not used that name! -->, PhD ([[Mayim Bialik]] [[Doctor of Philosophy|PhD]]) is a neuroscientist and Sheldon's love interest in the series. She has a PhD in neurobiology (Bialik herself has a PhD in neuroscience), with a research focus on addiction in primates and invertebrates, occasionally mentioning such experiments as getting a [[capuchin monkey]] addicted to cigarettes or starfish addicted to cocaine.\n\nRaj and Howard found Amy through an online dating site after secretly establishing an account using Sheldon's name and information. The site matches her to Sheldon, and the two share many similar traits. Once she and Sheldon meet, she becomes, as Sheldon puts it, a girl who is his friend, but not his \"girlfriend\". The two initially communicate by computer, but at the encouragement of the group, she starts socializing with the gang in person.\n\nEarly on, Amy is essentially a female counterpart to Sheldon. She is coldly rational, displays little emotion, and is awkward in social situations ranging from endearing to embarrassing. In season five, after Amy goes out on a date with comic-book store owner Stuart, Sheldon decides to solidify their relationship as boyfriend/girlfriend with a 31-page \"Relationship Agreement\". Later in the season, Amy begins a campaign to increase Sheldon's feelings for her by becoming more involved in his interests, including video games and ''[[Star Trek]],'' and treating him as his mother did. Sheldon says during Howard and Bernadette's wedding ceremony that he hopes the two of them are as happy together as he is alone, hurting Amy's feelings, but he spontaneously takes her hand for comfort later as Howard is launched into space.\n\nBy the beginning of season six, they are regularly holding hands at Amy's insistence, but Sheldon repeatedly resists all of her attempts to engage in further physical intimacy. By mid-season, Sheldon gets some intimate views of Amy when he cares for her while she has the flu, pushing him further toward a traditional relationship with her. She also provides Sheldon with consoling hugs, and receives a slap on the rear by an intoxicated Sheldon who tells everyone that she is a great gal.\n\nThey eventually move into Penny's old apartment together, while Penny moves in with Leonard, and later make the arrangement permanent. Amy is later offered a three-month course at a science camp in New Jersey and leaves with Sheldon's encouragement. She becomes angry when she learns of Sheldon spending time with Ramona Nowitzki, who she suspects has romantic feelings for Sheldon (which she does). In the season finale, after Ramona kisses Sheldon, he visits Amy and proposes to her. The episode ends on a [[cliffhanger]] awaiting her answer. In the season 11 premiere episode \"The Proposal Proposal\", which picks up immediately after Sheldon's proposal, Amy's answer is further delayed by a phone call from Leonard and Penny, after which she finally says yes. She and Sheldon marry in the season 11 finale. Amy objects to Sheldon wanting to provide sperm for Zack Johnson's baby, but does try and get him excited about having their own child.\n\nIn the final season, Sheldon and Amy publish their work on super-asymmetric string theory and win the Nobel Prize in Physics together.<ref>\"The Big Bang Theory Finale: EPs Talk Elevator Twist, Sheldon's Speech, Howard and Bernadette's [Spoilers],\" ''TV Line'' (May 16, 2019) https://tvline.com/2019/05/16/big-bang-theory-series-finale-sheldon-amy-nobel-prize/</ref>\n\n==== Stuart ====\n[[File:Kevin Sussman by Gage Skidmore.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Kevin Sussman]]]]\nStuart David Bloom<ref>{{cite episode|title=The Commitment Determination|episodelink=The Big Bang Theory (season 8)#ep183|series=The Big Bang Theory|serieslink=The Big Bang Theory|network=[[CBS]]|date=May 4, 2015|season= 8|number=24|time=13:35}} Howard tells Bernadette his middle name, because he wants her to make him move out of his mother's house.</ref><ref>{{cite episode|title=The Flaming Spittoon Acquisition|episodelink=The Flaming Spittoon Acquisition|series=The Big Bang Theory|serieslink=The Big Bang Theory|network=CBS|date=November 17, 2011|season=5|number=10|time=11:44}} Sheldon is viewing Stuart's Facebook page, where his name is shown as \"Stuart Bloom\".</ref> ([[Kevin Sussman]]) runs the Comic Center in Pasadena,<ref>{{cite episode|title=The Comet Polarization|series=The Big Bang Theory|network=CBS|date=April 19, 2018|season=11|number=21}}</ref> the comic book store that the characters often visit. Stuart is characterized by his low self-esteem and loneliness, which often result in pathetic attempts to engage with women and win favor with the main cast. This is despite owning his own (albeit troubled) business, and being a talented portraiture artist who attended the [[Rhode Island School of Design]].<ref>{{cite episode|title=The Hofstadter Isotope|series=The Big Bang Theory|network=CBS|date=April 13, 2009|season=2|number=20}}</ref>\n\nDuring Stuart's first appearances in season 2, he shows enough social skills to ask Penny on a date on two occasions, though neither ends successfully. In \"The Hofstadter Isotope\", his first date with Penny goes well for most of the evening, but when they return to her apartment, their run-in with Sheldon devolves into an endless argument between Stuart and Sheldon over the minutiae of ''[[Batman (comic book)|Batman]]'' comics that puts Penny to sleep. In \"The Classified Materials Turbulence\", their second date unravels when in the throes of a romantic embrace, Penny calls him \"Leonard\", ending any future prospects for them as a couple. In season five, Stuart goes on a date with Amy, but Sheldon interrupts the date to solidify his relationship with her.\n\nStuart was the partner of [[Wil Wheaton]] in a [[collectible card game|trading-card game]] tournament in which they defeated the team of Raj and Sheldon. As proprietor of a comic-book store, Stuart has an almost encyclopedic knowledge of comic books and superheroes. In the season-four episode \"[[The Toast Derivation]]\", he mentions that he is in financial trouble and that the store is now also his home, and over the years, he has questioned the profitability or success running the store.\n\nDuring \"The Decoupling Fluctuation\", Stuart becomes close friends with Raj and joins the gang as Howard's replacement while he is in space. When Howard returns, Sheldon wants to dismiss Stuart from the group, but Raj objects. Leonard tie-breaks on the basis that they are receiving a 20% discount in Stuart's store, and Sheldon relents after Stuart offers to go as high as 30%, thereby becoming a bigger and more prominent part of the core group. Sheldon has tried to hide his clear belief that Stuart is more of a hanger-on to the group of friends than a core member, most notably in a story where Stuart was part of a motley \"test brunch\" along with Burt the geologist and a neighbor who only spoke English she'd heard on TV, so Sheldon could work-out any hosting issues before trying an event with his \"real\" friends. Stuart actually got angry and told Sheldon it was clear they didn't even see him as a friend, leading Sheldon to sincerely apologize and try harder to be nice to Stuart for a period. Stuart is also limited vis-\u00e0-vis the group because he is a lot like Raj, a mostly-single guy around three couples, but Raj is best friends with Howard and closer friends with the others than Stuart.\n\nAfter his comic-book store is destroyed in a fire, Howard offers him a place to stay and a job as his mother, Debbie's, nurse. Stuart likes the job and develops a surprising closeness with Debbie, even staying long after she recovers, to Howard's annoyance. After Debbie's death, Howard and Bernadette move back into the house, with Stuart still staying. In the eighth-season finale, the two attempt to ask Stuart to move out, but are unable to bring themselves to do it after Stuart reveals it is his birthday. He eventually makes his own decision to move in the middle of season 9; however in the middle of season 10, he reveals that he has been evicted from his apartment and tries to use his helping with Howard and Bernadette's baby to move back in with them, much to Raj's chagrin. He does not always appear with the main group, as he was somehow not at Howard and Bernadette's during the birth of their 2nd child Neil.\n\nKevin Sussman was a recurring guest actor from seasons two to five, and was promoted to starring role for the sixth season onwards.<ref>{{cite journal |first=Nellie |last=Andreeva |title=''Big Bang Theory'' 's Kevin Sussman Upped To Regular |url=http://deadline.com/2012/08/big-bang-theorys-kevin-sussman-upped-to-regular-323353/ |journal=[[Deadline Hollywood]] |date=August 22, 2012 |accessdate=November 5, 2016}}</ref>\n\nDuring season 11, he hires a woman named Denise ([[Lauren Lapkus]]), at his shop, and becomes attracted to her. In the season 11 finale, Denise is his date to Sheldon and Amy's wedding, where she exhibits an attraction to Stuart when he displays a superior level of knowledge of ''Star Wars'' trivia to [[Mark Hamill]], who is performing the ceremony. In the second episode of season 12, they are revealed to have made out at the ceremony, and have their first date at the end of that episode.\n\n==== Emily ====\nEmily Sweeney, [[Doctor of Medicine|M.D.]], ([[Laura Spencer (actress)|Laura Spencer]]) is a [[dermatology]] [[resident (medicine)|resident]] at [[Huntington Hospital]], whom Raj finds on an online dating site. Emily went to Harvard and is shown to have a slightly alarming personality trait: she delights in the [[macabre]].\n\nIn season seven, after finding Emily's online dating profile, Raj has Amy contact her. Amy and Emily exchange emails and find they have a lot in common. Emily does not like Raj's inability to correspond with her directly; but, when he does agree to meet her, he acts weirdly and she leaves. Raj later bumps into Emily and apologizes for their previous encounter. She gives him another chance and agrees to go out to dinner with him. In \"The Relationship Diremption\", Raj and Emily have dinner with Howard and Bernadette. Upon meeting Emily, Howard recognizes her from a blind date they had sometime before he met Bernadette. The blind date ended badly, causing him embarrassment at the dinner, but no issues.\n\nIn \"The Gorilla Dissolution\", Raj and Sheldon bump into Emily at the movies with another guy. Later, she visits him to talk and reveals that the guy was her tattoo artist who had been asking her out for weeks and she did so just to end the obligation. Emily then spends the night; and, in the next episode, Raj reveals to the gang that Emily and he are exclusive.\n\nIn season eight, Raj introduces Emily to Leonard and Penny; however, Penny senses that Emily does not like her. Emily reveals that she is uncomfortable with the fact that Raj and Penny previously kissed. Emily and Penny later sit down to settle their differences, with mixed results. Emily continues to socialize with the gang in season 8, and in the finale, she suggests to Raj that they have sex in a graveyard. Raj wonders whether he should break up with her because of her alarming personality. The next season, Raj somewhat rashly breaks up with Emily after meeting another girl, Claire, and fantasizing about starting a family with her, though Claire makes amends with her boyfriend and berates Raj for his actions. He tries to reconcile with Emily, but she shuts the door in his face. Later in the season, Emily and Raj reconcile after a tearful phone call. However, in season 10, Raj mentions that he is currently single. He and Howard invite Emily, Claire, Lucy, and Emily the deaf woman to Raj's apartment for an intervention to find out why women keep dumping Raj. Emily mentions that, although she enjoyed her sexual relationship with Raj, she was put off by his fear of his parents.\n\nLaura Spencer was a recurring guest actress on the series in seasons seven and eight. During production of season 9, she was promoted to a \"fractional\" starring role; the upgraded status ensured her availability on an as-needed basis, without requiring her in every episode.<ref>{{cite journal |first=Michael |last=Ausiello |title=''The Big Bang Theory'': Laura Spencer Promoted to Series Regular |url=http://tvline.com/2015/10/12/big-bang-theory-season-9-laura-spencer-series-regular-emily/ |journal=[[TVLine]] |date=October 12, 2015 |accessdate=November 5, 2016}}</ref> She returned as a guest in season 10; the character was written out of the series, and did not appear after season 10.\n\n=== ''Young Sheldon'' main characters ===\n\n==== Mary Cooper ====\nMary (''n\u00e9e'' Tucker)<ref name=\"sheldonS1E17\">''[[Young Sheldon]]'' episode \"Jiu-Jitsu, Bubble Wrap, and Yoo-Hoo\"</ref> Cooper ([[Zoe Perry]]) is Sheldon's loving, caring and religious mother and a [[Christians|devout Christian]] from Texas.

Her husband, a rambunctious [[alcoholism|alcoholic]], was also named George, but he died when Sheldon was still a boy. To Mary's relief, her other children do not share Sheldon's hyperintelligence, once commenting to Leonard, \"I thank the good Lord my other kids are as dumb as soup\". Mary herself is not intellectual, but is quite wise, though she is prone to making insensitive comments such as calling Japanese words \"kung fu letters\" at a sushi restaurant, or calling Native Americans [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|\"our\" Indians]]. Despite her religious views, she is tolerant of other faiths, as evidenced by her serving Raj a dish of chicken after making sure it was not something Indians considered \"magical\". She also struggles to follow her beliefs sometimes. She is a loving mother and has been able to control Sheldon, with Leonard describing her as Sheldon's \"[[Kryptonite]]\" to Penny. When Penny and Sheldon engaged in a fierce dispute, Penny called for Mary's help, who subsequently called and scolded Sheldon about his actions.<ref name=\"S02E07\">{{Cite episode|title=The Panty Pi\u00f1ata Polarization|episodelink=List of The Big Bang Theory episodes#ep24|series=The Big Bang Theory|serieslink=The Big Bang Theory|date=November 10, 2008|season=2|number=7}}</ref> Leonard wishes his mother were<!-- subjunctive --> as loving as Sheldon's mother, although Sheldon himself appears at best ambivalent about her parenting. Sheldon once mentions that Mary once hit him with a Bible because he refused to eat his Brussels sprouts. She apparently thought something was wrong with her son while he was growing up, as Sheldon will often remark after someone calls him crazy, \"I'm not crazy; my mother had me tested!\" Though Mary confirms this, she wishes that she had taken him to Houston for further testing.\n\nIn her first visit, Leonard calls Mary to intervene when Sheldon is fired for being disrespectful to his new boss, Dr. Gablehauser. She manages to convince Sheldon to apologize and he gets his job back, and she becomes romantically interested in Dr. Gablehauser. When Sheldon asks, \"Is Dr. Gablehauser going to be my new daddy?\", Mary replies, \"We'll see\".\n\nIn season three of The Big Bang Theory, after returning from the North Pole, Sheldon returns to his home in Texas after the other guys tampered with his research. Mary calls the guys and they come to fetch Sheldon. Sheldon initially refuses to leave, although after an argument with his mother about [[evolution]], Sheldon decides to leave. Mary is again called to intervene in \"The Zazzy Substitution\" when Sheldon buys a clowder of cats after his \"break-up\" with Amy. Mary uses [[reverse psychology]] to get Sheldon to reconcile with Amy. She again comes to visit in \"The Rhinitis Revelation\" before going on a Christian cruise, and Sheldon becomes jealous when she would rather go sightseeing with the rest of the gang instead of cooking for him and attending physics lectures.\n\nIn season seven of The Big Bang Theory, Sheldon returns to Texas to assist Mary in the birth of his twin sister's baby. Howard later takes Sheldon to see Mary after visiting [[NASA]] headquarters, but flees after Sheldon sees her having sex. Sheldon returns and gets into an argument, and is sent to his room. After Howard tells him about how he drove away an admirer of his mother, Sheldon apologizes to Mary, saying that he will accept her choices on the outside while condemning her internally for being a hypocrite by going against her religious beliefs. Mary forgives him.\n\nIn season 8 of The Big Bang Theory, Mary meets Dr. Beverly Hofstadter, Leonard's mother. The two very different women start out as civil, but later quickly come to clash as Beverly insults and belittles Mary strict religious beliefs, and Mary in turn derides Beverly's cold attitude. Mary is especially insulted when Beverly is left dumbstruck how a genius intellect like Sheldon could be born to a woman like her. After taking a break from each other, the two come to terms with the argument: Mary decides to forgive Beverly for her offhandish ways, and Beverly realizes there is more than one way to raise a child. The two mothers make up and Beverly tries unconditional love by trying an awkward hug with Leonard.\n\nIn season nine of The Big Bang Theory, Sheldon calls her to tell her that Amy broke up with him and that he would like to send the family heirloom engagement ring back, but she advises him to hold on to it, just in case. She reappears in the season finale \"The Convergence-Convergence\" where she comes to attend Leonard and Penny's re-wedding where she is not at all happy to see Beverly. She meets Leonard's father Alfred Hofstadter and the two get along great as they have each other's nice, gentle, and caring personalities, bonding over their mutual dislike of Beverly, and their admiration of each other's beliefs. The two of them end up fighting with Beverly at the restaurant during the pre-ceremony dinner and the two leave together and after finding out they are staying at the same hotel, they decide to share a cab and it is implied that the two hook up. \n\nIn season 10 of The Big Bang Theory, during a visit to see her, Sheldon and Amy break it to her they are living together and Sheldon is stunned that she is not offended that they are \"[[cohabitation|living in sin]]\" due to her belief he was never going to find anyone.\n\nIn season 11 of The Big Bang Theory, Mary reappeared in the season premiere, \"The Proposal Proposal,\" when Sheldon phoned her to tell her that he and Amy were engaged. Mary was happy for both of them, but she was not surprised, as she had been praying for them. Sheldon informed his mother that they would not be getting married in a church, which was okay with Mary, as she said anywhere Jesus is a church, and he'll be there in her heart. She was also quite surprised to hear that there was more than one woman interested in Sheldon, otherwise she might've prayed a little too hard. After hanging up, Mary thanks the Lord for making the engagement happen, and that even though he (the Lord) can do anything, that was mighty impressive.\n\nShe reappeared in the \"The Solo Oscillation,\" where she called Sheldon, who was annoyed by it, since he was trying to find something to work on.\n\nIn \"The Bow Tie Asymmetry\", Mary and her daughter Missy are picked up from the airport by Raj. She mentions that they had also been driven to the airport by an Indian fellow. Missy object to her comment. Mary also is in denial that her daughter is also separated from her husband. Later at the wedding, when Mrs. Fowler wants to take her daughter way because she thinks that Sheldon has left her at the altar, Penny tells her to stop and that Sheldon would never hurt the woman he loves. Mary stands up and applauds Penny who tells her to sit down too. Mary also tells Sheldon how proud she is of him and that her comment that sometimes it is the imperfections in things that make things perfect gives Sheldon an epiphany about his string theory work.\n\nMary has argued with Leonard's mother, Beverly, over the fact she never nurtured Leonard properly the way she has with Sheldon, while Beverly has criticized her for her narrow-minded beliefs.\n\nA younger version of Mary (played by Metcalf's real-life daughter [[Zoe Perry]]) is a main character in the prequel series ''[[Young Sheldon]]''. It is revealed in season 2 that Mary became a devout Christian after a difficult birth with Sheldon and Missy where Missy almost died. It is also revealed that she had a miscarriage after the pregnancy with Sheldon and Missy. In season 3 it is revealed that she was forced into a [[shotgun wedding]] with George.\n\n==== George Sr. ====\nGeorge Cooper, Sr. is the father of Georgie, Sheldon and Missy Cooper and the husband of Mary Tucker-Cooper. In ''The Big Bang Theory'', it is established that he died when Sheldon and Missy were fourteen years old. He is portrayed by [[Lance Barber]].\n\n==== Georgie Jr. ====\nGeorge \"Georgie\" Cooper Jr. ([[Jerry O'Connell]]): Sheldon and Missy's brother, who lives in Texas and runs a car tire business. Often at odds while growing up, the Cooper brothers begin to reconcile their differences when Sheldon and Leonard visit George in season 11 before Sheldon's wedding. Known as Georgie in his younger days, he appears as a main character on ''[[Young Sheldon]]'' played by [[Montana Jordan]].\n\n==== Missy ====\n{{Expand section|More on her escapades in Young Sheldon|small=no|date=November 2019}}\n{{visible anchor|Missy Cooper}} ([[Raegan Revord]]): She is intellectually and socially quite unlike her brother.\n\nThe adult version of the character is played by [[Courtney Henggeler]] and appears in the episode \"The Porkchop Indeterminacy\" of ''Big Bang Theory''. Missy has grown up to be a tall, attractive woman that promptly catches the attention of Leonard, Howard, and Raj. Sheldon realizes that, within Missy's eggs, lies the potential for another \"superior mutation\" like him. He temporarily sets himself up as a guardian to Missy in order to choose the best mate for her. Missy refers to Sheldon as \"Shelly\" and, despite their differences, she loves him and is proud of his accomplishments. In \"The Cooper Extraction\", she gives birth to a baby boy with Sheldon helping while her husband is recovering from a motorcycle accident, but does not appear on-screen. Henggeler reprises the role in the eleventh-season finale \"The Bow Tie Asymmetry\", where Missy, pregnant with her second child, travels with her mother to Pasadena to attend Sheldon's wedding. It is mentioned that she is separated from her husband, which piques Raj's interest.\n\n==== MeeMaw ====\n[[File:June Squibb Cannes 2013.jpg|thumb|upright|[[June Squibb]]]]\nConstance \"MeeMaw\" Tucker<ref name=\"sheldonS1E17\" /> ([[June Squibb]]): Sheldon's grandmother from Texas. Sheldon is her favorite grandchild, whom she calls \"[[Moonpie]]\". Sheldon, in turn, is very affectionate and protective toward her; while he can be very critical of other family members, he will not allow anyone to criticize his grandmother. Meemaw is often mentioned by Sheldon, but did not appear on the series until episode 14 of season nine, \"The Meemaw Manifestation\".\n\nMeemaw takes an immediate dislike to Amy upon meeting her. It appears she came to visit her grandson, but the real reason she came was to size Amy up and she dislikes Amy because of her breaking Sheldon's heart when she broke up with him. Meemaw keeps this to herself until dinner where she reveals this in front of her grandson, his girlfriend and the married Hofstadter couple. Later, Sheldon reasons with her about how she made her husband (Sheldon's maternal grandfather) a better person when he was stubborn and egotistical and Meemaw soon gives her blessings to Sheldon and Amy's relationship.\n\nIn the prequel series ''[[Young Sheldon]]'', Meemaw is played by [[Annie Potts]]. In that series, it is revealed that she is Sheldon's maternal grandmother and has a compulsive gambling habit.\n\n==== Pastor Jeff ====\nJeff Difford (Matt Hobby) is a pastor at the church that Sheldon and his family attend in ''Young Sheldon''. Like Mary, he has friction with Sheldon's atheism, but he often challenges Sheldon to explore their line of thought through logic exercises. He was originally given the last name Hodgkins, but it was changed to Difford as of the episode \"Seven Deadly Sins and a Small Carl Sagan\".\n\n== Supporting characters ==\nThe following list is sorted in alphabetic order of first names.\n\n=== Cast table ===\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center; width:97%;\"\n! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:22%;\" | Character\n! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:13%;\" | Portrayed by\n! scope=\"col\" colspan=\"12\" | ''[[The Big Bang Theory]]''\n! scope=\"col\" colspan=\"3\" | ''[[Young Sheldon]]''\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:5%;\" | [[The Big Bang Theory (season 1)|1]]\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:5%;\" | [[The Big Bang Theory (season 2)|2]]\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:5%;\" | [[The Big Bang Theory (season 3)|3]]\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:5%;\" | [[The Big Bang Theory (season 4)|4]]\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:5%;\" | [[The Big Bang Theory (season 5)|5]]\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:5%;\" | [[The Big Bang Theory (season 6)|6]]\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:5%;\" | [[The Big Bang Theory (season 7)|7]]\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:5%;\" | [[The Big Bang Theory (season 8)|8]]\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:5%;\" | [[The Big Bang Theory (season 9)|9]]\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:5%;\" | [[The Big Bang Theory (season 10)|10]]\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:5%;\" | [[The Big Bang Theory (season 11)|11]]\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:5%;\" | [[The Big Bang Theory (season 12)|12]]\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:5%;\" | [[Young Sheldon#Season 1 (2017\u201318)|1]]\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:5%;\" | [[Young Sheldon#Season 2 (2018\u201319)|2]]\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:5%;\" | [[Young Sheldon#Season 3 (2018\u201319)|3]]\n|-\n| scope=''row''| [[#Kurt|Kurt]]\n| [[Brian Patrick Wade]]\n| colspan=\"2\" {{CRecurring}}\n| colspan=\"13\" {{N/a|}}\n|-\n| scope=\"row\" | [[#Eric Gablehauser|Eric Gablehauser]]\n| [[Mark Harelik]]\n| colspan=\"2\" {{CRecurring}}\n| colspan=\"13\" {{N/a|}}\n|-\n| scope=\"row\" | [[#Mrs. Wolowitz|Mrs. Wolowitz]]\n| [[Carol Ann Susi]]\n| colspan=\"8\" {{CRecurring|[[Recurring character|Recurring]], [[Voice actor|voice only]]}}\n| colspan=\"2\" {{N/a|}}\n| {{CGuest}}{{efn|name=CAS posthumous|Posthumous appearance using archived voice recording.}}\n| colspan=\"2\" {{N/a|}}\n| {{CGuest}}{{efn|name=CAS posthumous}}\n| {{N/a|}}\n|-\n| scope=\"row\" | [[#V.

a Caltech graduate student who appears in season six.  Sheldon hires her to review his kindergarten and elementary-school notebooks for any possible Nobel Prize-winning research and attend to the tasks that Sheldon perceives a waste of his own valuable time. Amy is at first jealous until she sees Alex instead flirting with an unresponsive Leonard.\n\nAfter repeated attempts by Alex, Leonard finally realizes that Alex is making advances toward him. While proclaiming his loyalty to Penny, Leonard is flattered. Sheldon interferes (with the perceived intention of mitigating a situation that needed none) by lecturing Alex, but only succeeds in insulting her. After Alex files a sexual harassment complaint, Sheldon is forced to apologize and is ordered take a university-mandated online sexual-harassment course. Because Sheldon considers his own time as too valuable to waste on it, Sheldon asks Alex to take the course instead. For Valentine's Day, Sheldon sends Alex out to buy a present for Amy, which he likes so much, he keeps.<ref>{{cite journal| url=http://www.tv.com/news/the-big-bang-theory-the-bakersfield-expedition-review-comic-book-women-30381/| last=Sleasman| first=MaryAnn| title=''The Big Bang Theory'' \"The Bakersfield Expedition\" Review: Comic Book Women| journal=[[TV.com]]| date=January 11, 2013}}</ref>\n\n<!--\n--------------------------------------------------------------\nSo far, Alfred Hofstadter appears in only two consecutive episodes. Therefore, it's hard to call this character a recurring character. Commenting out this paragraph (rather than deleting it) in case this character is brought back for additional appearances\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n==== Alfred Hofstadter ====\n[[File:Judd Hirsch - 1967.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Judd Hirsch]]]]\n\nAlfred Hofstadter ([[Judd Hirsch]]) is Leonard's father, an anthropologist who once worked with famed archaeologist [[Louis Leakey]]. He was miserable in his marriage to Leonard's mother Beverly, who was always annoying and was unmotherly towards their children. Alfred claimed she was cold and emasculating, and had not shown him any physical affection for years. On another bit, when Leonard was six, he walked in on his parents naked, and she was swatting his rear end with Leonard's brand-new ping-pong paddle. In season three, the two were revealed to be getting divorced after he had had an affair with a waitress.\n\nIn his first appearance in \"The Convergence-Convergence\" during his visit for Leonard and Penny's rewedding, he meets Mary Cooper and the two get along great as they have each other's nice, gentle, and caring personalities, bonding over their mutual dislike of Beverly, and their admiration of each other's beliefs. The two of them end up fighting with Beverly at the restaurant during the pre-ceremony dinner and the two leave together and after finding out they are staying at the same hotel, they decide to share a cab and it is implied that the two hook up.\n\nIn \"The Conjugal Conjecture\", Alfred is revealed to have not slept with Mary, but they still plan on seeing each other in the future. In the ceremony, he says that though Beverly and he do not bring the best out in each other, something wonderful did come out of their relationship: Leonard. Beverly agrees. On the way to the airport, they appear to be civil for about a minute until they start bickering over Leonard's driving.\n-->\n==== Anu ====\nAnu ([[Rati Gupta]]) is the woman who Raj's father sets him up with after asking him to arrange a marriage for him who first appears in season 12. She works in a hotel as a concierge.\n\nIn \"The Wedding Gift Wormhole\", depressed over everyone else being in a relationship, Raj asks his father to arrange a marriage for him, and sets him up with Anu. On their first date, Anu's commanding personality and practical approach to marriage startle Raj but nonetheless he agrees to go ahead with it. Howard criticizes Raj for this \u2013 he never expected Raj to just give up on romance. Raj admits this to Anu so she proposes to him, and he says yes. She meets Penny and Bernadette in \"The Tam Turbulence\", where they track her down at the hotel she works at to check her out and end up impressed by her connections in the hotel industry, although the evening turns sour when they get drunk and end up telling her embarrassing things about Raj. In \"The Consummation Deviation\", Anu wants to have sex with Raj for the first time, but he gets so nervous that his selective mutism returns. Confessing this to her, she is very understanding, revealing an unusual secret of her own: she hates music. The next morning, he is able to have sex with her in the shower. When Raj installs a doorbell camera at Anu's home, he accidentally spies on her and sees her greeting her ex-boyfriend, they realize how little they know about each other. The wedding gets cancelled, but they agree to start their relationship over by just dating. Anu later gets a job offer while working in London, and Raj considers leaving to propose to her, but Howard convinces him to wait for the right woman.\n\n==== Arthur Jeffries ====\n[[File:Comedian Bob Newhart.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Bob Newhart]]]]\n\nArthur Jeffries, or Professor Proton ([[Bob Newhart]]) is the star of a science show that Sheldon and Leonard watched as children. The character is a homage to [[Watch Mr. Wizard|Mr. Wizard]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://ew.com/article/2013/11/07/big-bang-theory-bill-nye/|title='Big Bang Theory': Bill Nye's preview|first=Erin|last=Strecker|date=November 7, 2013|publisher=[[Entertainment Weekly]]}}</ref> After the show was cancelled, Jeffries was not taken seriously as a scientist and resorted to doing children's parties as his persona. In \"The Proton Resurgence\", Sheldon hires him to do a private party for Leonard and himself (and Penny). Later, Jeffries has a heart attack as a result of climbing the apartment stairs with his equipment. He asks Sheldon to take his place at a party for a Korean family, which Sheldon agrees to do as \"Professor Proton, Jr\".\n\nWhile Sheldon idolizes him, Jeffries is constantly irritated by Sheldon's personality, and takes a shine to Penny. In \"The Proton Displacement\", Leonard, Sheldon, and Amy bump into Jeffries at a drugstore, and Sheldon becomes upset when Jeffries asks Leonard for help on a paper instead of him, and when he finds out that Jeffries thinks he is annoying, Sheldon works with [[Bill Nye the Science Guy]], whom Jeffries accuses of stealing material from his TV show. After Nye abandons Sheldon and files for a restraining order against him, Jeffries arrives at Sheldon and Leonard's apartment and asks Sheldon for his advice on his paper (although Sheldon already hacked his email account and read it for himself).\n\nIn \"The Proton Transmogrification\" on [[Star Wars Day]], Leonard tells Sheldon that Jeffries has died. Sheldon immediately pretends not to care and refuses to go to the funeral. Jeffries appears to Sheldon in a dream, where Sheldon compares him to [[Obi-Wan Kenobi]], dressing him in Jedi robes and making him appear as a Force ghost. When Sheldon asks for his wisdom, Jeffries tells Sheldon to appreciate everything in life, including his friends, and never take it for granted.\n\nJeffries returns in \"The Opening Night Excitation\" when his ghost convinces Sheldon to spend time with Amy on her birthday instead of going to see ''[[Star Wars: The Force Awakens]]'' as he had planned to do for months. After hearing Professor Proton's words, Sheldon decides to prove his devotion to Amy by finally having sex with her, as she has been hoping he will do for the past few years. Some time later, after Sheldon takes Amy to see ''The Force Awakens'', Jeffries returns to Sheldon to ask him about his first sexual experience with her, but Sheldon thinks Jeffries is talking about the film and tells him he enjoyed it.\n\nFor his role as Jeffries, in 2013, Newhart won his first [[Primetime Emmy Award]]. Newhart plays the same character on ''[[Young Sheldon]]''.\n\n==== Barry Kripke ====\n[[File:John Ross Bowie by Gage Skidmore.jpg|thumb|upright|[[John Ross Bowie]]]]\nBarry Kripke, PhD ([[John Ross Bowie]]) is a co-worker of the guys, who frequently clashes with Sheldon. He works in [[plasma physics]]. Kripke has a case of [[Rhotacism (speech impediment)|rhotacism]] in which he pronounces the letters <small>\"R\"</small> and <small>\"L\"</small> as <small>\"W\"</small> in much the same way as [[Elmer Fudd]] from ''[[Looney Tunes]]'' and [[Gilda Radner]] in her \"[[Baba Wawa]]\" sketches. In season five, Kripke purchases an [[iPhone]] with [[Siri|voice-recognition technology]], but, because of his rhotacism, the device is incapable of understanding his verbal \"wequests\", prompting him to deride it as ineffective. Until season seven, whether he was aware of his impediment was never clarified.\n\nIn his first appearance, he pits his robot, the Kripke Krippler, against the men's robot, M.O.N.T.E., in an unofficial [[Robot Fighting League|robot fight]].<ref name=\"S02E12\">{{cite episode|title=The Killer Robot Instability|episodelink=List of The Big Bang Theory episodes#ep29|series=The Big Bang Theory|serieslink=The Big Bang Theory|date=January 12, 2009|season=2|number=12}}</ref> The guys lose to Kripke, and M.O.N.T.E. is destroyed. In \"[[The Friendship Algorithm]]\", Sheldon attempts to befriend Kripke to gain access to an [[open science]] [[grid computing|grid computer]] to conduct research, but it turns out to be futile, as Kripke has no control over the computer's usage time, and Sheldon consequently expels Kripke from the group.<ref name=\"S02E13\">{{cite episode|title=The Friendship Algorithm|episodelink=List of The Big Bang Theory episodes#ep30|series=The Big Bang Theory|serieslink=The Big Bang Theory|date=January 19, 2009|season=2|number=13}}</ref> Kripke continues his antagonism towards Sheldon in \"The Vengeance Formulation\" by pulling a prank on Sheldon when he is a guest on [[NPR]]'s ''[[Science Friday]] ''by putting a helium tank in his office, making Sheldon's voice more squeaky.<ref name=\"S03E09\">{{cite episode|title=The Vengeance Formulation|episodelink=List of The Big Bang Theory episodes#ep49|series=The Big Bang Theory|serieslink=The Big Bang Theory|date=November 23, 2009|season=3|number=9}}</ref> In \"[[The Toast Derivation]]\", Sheldon tries to befriend Kripke and a few others when he is feeling excluded by his friends, but Kripke and the others all connect in a manner that Sheldon finds 'wrong' and leaves.<ref name=\"S04E17\">{{cite episode|title=The Toast Derivation|episodelink=The Toast Derivation|series=The Big Bang Theory|serieslink=The Big Bang Theory|date=February 24, 2011|season=4|number=17}}</ref>\n\nIn season five, Kripke and Sheldon [[The_Rothman_Disintegration|battle over a retired professor's office]]; but, after a long sports contest, Kripke loses to Sheldon. He is later invited to Howard's [[bachelor party]], where he uses his turn toasting to complain that no [[stripper]]s are at the party.\n\nIn season six, Kripke and Sheldon are forced to work together on a proposal involving fusion reactors, which involves an exchange of work. Sheldon is shocked to discover that Kripke's work is more advanced than his own, and he tearfully admits as much to Amy. Kripke assumes that Sheldon is in a sexual relationship with Amy and that has led to his work quality declining, and Sheldon does not deny it (although this appears to be just a convenient excuse since his work is inferior to Kripke's). Kripke also battles for tenure alongside Sheldon, Leonard, and Raj.\n\nIn season seven, Kripke ridicules Sheldon when his discovery of a new element was false, nicknaming Sheldon \"The Retractor\".\n\nIn season nine, Kripke calls Sheldon and Amy's live show ''[[Fun with Flags]]'' along with Raj and directs the conversation to irrelevant questions to the show. He also uses the show to call out for potential romantic relationships and asked Amy questions about her love life when Sheldon and she broke up. He attends Sheldon's birthday party and constantly hits on Leonard's mother, [[Beverly_Hofstadter|Beverly]].\n\n==== Bert Kibbler ====\n[[File:Brian Posehn 1.JPG|thumb|upright|[[Brian Posehn]]]]\n\nProfessor Bertram Kibbler ([[Brian Posehn]]) is a [[geologist]] at Caltech, who met Amy while she was working there in her own lab in \"The Occupation Recalibration\". Bert brings Amy interesting and beautiful rocks every day. It takes Howard and Raj to point out that he likes her. Bert then asks her to a [[rock (geology)|rock]] and [[mineral]] show, which she declines because she has a boyfriend. When Bert starts talking about how no one wants to do anything with him, Amy in a fit of sympathy agrees to go. Unfortunately, Bert is taking it as a date. Raj and Howard offer to talk to him to let him down easy, and they end up going with him to the show.\n\nBert first appeared in \"The Contractual Obligation Implementation\" where he is socially awkward and Raj meets just prior to a library date with Lucy. He tried to crash their date, and Raj sent him away. His name was not mentioned in the plot, but the closing credits gave the name Bert.\n\nIn \"The Dependence Transcendence\", Bert hosts a Caltech party that only Amy and Penny attend. He feels that Amy is the coolest girl at work and that Sheldon is cool only because he is dating Amy. As the girls are leaving, he tells them that he is in love with both of them.\n\nHe reappears in \"The Fetal Kick Catalyst\" as a guest at Sheldon and Amy's brunch in their apartment. He mentions that a girlfriend he was living with once moved out and took all his best rocks.\n\nIn \"The Geology Elevation\", Bert wins the [[MacArthur Fellows Program|MacArthur Fellowship]] grant, which makes Sheldon jealous. When Sheldon finally confronts him over this, Bert points out that the theoretical physicist has his friends and Amy to be happy about. He later accompanies Sheldon to ''[[The Ellen DeGeneres Show]]'' to make peace. His full name is shown in his award. By the end of season 10, Raj moves into the apartment over Bert's garage.\n\nBert reappears in \"The Separation Agitation\", and it is revealed that he has a recent girlfriend named Rebecca, who only appears to be with him for his grant money. After breaking up with her, Bert instantly regrets it and buys expensive gifts to win her back. At the end of the episode, he is revealed to have succeeded.\n\n==== Beverly Hofstadter ====\n[[File:ROMY 2012 04 Christine Baranski crop.JPG|thumb|upright|[[Christine Baranski]]]]\n\nBeverly Hofstadter ([[Christine Baranski]]) is Leonard's [[narcissist]]ic, unloving, and overly analytical mother. Beverly is a [[neuroscientist]], as well as a [[psychiatrist]]. She is Sheldon's female equivalent regarding neurotically strict [[Idiolect|speech pattern]]s, lack of respect for [[social convention]]s, and compulsive attention to detail. The only reason she had children was to use them as personal experiments for her research, so was very distant and unmotherly towards Leonard. Beverly mentions that Leonard's brother and sister are more successful in their respective fields than he is; though she respects this enough to keep contact with them (unlike Leonard), she is not proud, since they are not her accomplishments. One of her famous books is ''Needy Baby, Greedy Baby'', in which she describes an infant's (Leonard's) unrealistic nurturing expectations. Sheldon often refers to her books when frustrated with Leonard's attempt to obtain some of his personal needs in their relationship. Leonard sees his mother as cold and not nurturing, even telling Penny that one time he made a [[Hug machine|hugging machine]] just to get hugs (and that his father asked to borrow it). The lack of Beverly's maternal feelings and actions toward Leonard has led to him being called the \"King of [[Foreplay]]\" because of his obsessive need to please.\n\nIn her first visit, Beverly makes Penny cry by delving into her history with her father (driving her, and later Leonard, to the bottle), and considers Raj and Howard's relationship to be an \"[[ersatz]] homosexual marriage\". After bonding with Sheldon, Beverly sings [[Journey (band)|Journey's]] \"[[Any Way You Want It]]\" with him on karaoke.\n\nIn season three, Beverly comes to visit at Christmas, where she reveals that she is divorcing her husband, Alfred, after she caught him in bed with another woman. Despite Leonard's reluctance to tell Beverly about his and Penny's relationship, Penny takes her to the Cheesecake Factory for a round of drinks and reveals their relationship. After Beverly gropes a [[busboy]], she and Penny both go to [[Del Taco]] and then return to Leonard and Sheldon's apartment where she confronts Leonard on not telling him about Penny, and then is confronted by him for not being a loving and caring mother for him. After Beverly tries to show motherly affection by hugging Leonard, she kisses a shocked Sheldon and leaves. The next morning, a hungover Beverly gives her blessing to Leonard and Penny's relationship and vows not to reveal her drunken kiss with Sheldon, wanting to work instead on her maternal relationship with Leonard.\n\nIn season five, Sheldon calls Beverly on Skype to help Leonard following Penny and Raj's hook-up, and she tells Leonard to \"buck up, sissypants...If you need any more help from me, my books are available on [[Amazon.com|Amazon]]\".\n\nIn season seven, Leonard uses Beverly's latest book to get sympathy from Penny. However, Bernadette finds out from Howard what Leonard is doing and tells Penny, who calls Beverly, leaving a briefly pantsless Leonard to chat with his mother on [[Skype]]. Leonard later informs his mother of his engagement to Penny, but she reveals that Sheldon already told her. She decides to accept his engagement with Penny because Sheldon likes her.\n\nIn season eight, Beverly comes to visit to see Leonard receive an award, where she meets Sheldon's mother, Mary. The mothers get into an argument after Beverly describes Mary's religious beliefs as a superstition, and Mary, in turn, berates Beverly for her cold and distant attitude towards Leonard. Beverly later reflects with Sheldon that perhaps other ways exist to raise children than she did. The mothers make up and Beverly tries to show affection by hugging Leonard, though it is awkward for both of them.\n\nIn season nine, she attends Sheldon's birthday party and enjoys a proposition from Barry Kripke. Later, she returns for a visit to interview people for her new book, and spends her time bonding with Amy and Bernadette, frustrating Penny's attempts to bond with her. When Penny confronts her for this, she admits that she feels insulted about not being invited to her son's wedding. Penny suggests doing a second wedding ceremony for her, which she accepts and the two finally bond. She is unhappy about her ex-husband, Alfred, attending since their marriage ended due to his affair, and is even angrier when Alfred and Mary Cooper display mutual attraction and leave the rehearsal dinner together. Beverly and Alfred argue all night and Beverly once again quarrels with Mary. At the ceremony, she agrees with Alfred that Leonard was the best thing to come out of their relationship.\n\nIn season 11, Beverly begins talking to Penny as a friend and confidant, troubling Leonard, especially when he learns that Beverly told Penny that she is proud of her, a level of praise she never bestowed upon Leonard himself. When Leonard confronts Beverly, he is touched when she says that of all of her children's spouses, Penny is the one she is most impressed by, and that for this, she is indeed proud of him.\n\nShe reappeared in \"The Novelization Correlation\" as the character Ilsa from Leonard's book, as well as appearing over Skype.\n\nIn season 12, she appeared in \"The VCR Illumination\" via video chat when Leonard and Penny talked to her about comforting Sheldon. She reappeared in the seventeenth episode, \"The Conference Valuation\".\n\nIn \"The Maternal Conclusion\", Beverly visits Leonard and Penny acting nice and truly interested in Leonard's new physics project. Later she admits that she is doing research for a new book which makes Leonard blow up. Finally he forgives her which makes both of them feel much better and they end in a true loving embrace.\n\nFor her role as Beverly, in both 2009 and 2010, Baranski was nominated for an [[Emmy Award]] for [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Guest Actress in a Comedy Series|Outstanding Guest Actress in a Comedy Series]].\n\n==== Claire ====\n[[File:AlessandraTorresaniApr09.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Alessandra Torresani]]]]\n\nClaire ([[Alessandra Torresani]]) is a writer for a children's science fiction series whom Raj and Howard meet in the comic book store in season 9. Claire wants to collaborate with Raj on the science portions of a movie script. When Raj reveals to her that he has a girlfriend, Emily, she assures him that she is only interested in his technical assistance, and they can still meet as friends. However, Raj develops visions of marriage and children with Claire. After Raj breaks up with Emily, he calls Claire on Valentine's Day, only to learn that she has just got back together with her boyfriend. She also calls Raj an \"ass\" for breaking up with Emily just before Valentine's Day. Later, however, she asks Raj out for a drink after she has again broken up with her boyfriend. However, Raj is on his way to reunite with Emily, and chooses to be with her. However, Raj later starts seeing Claire again while at the same time dating Emily. She and Raj continue to date, but they keep their relationship casual with no commitment. When she meets Raj's friends, Claire begins to realize that Raj has been dating multiple women, and successfully tricks him into admitting it.\n\nIn season 10, Raj reveals that he is now single, having broken up with both Emily and Claire at the ladies' behest. Later in the season, when Raj tries to figure out what is wrong with himself, Claire accepts an invitation to Raj's apartment, where she meets his previous girlfriends. Claire reveals that she broke up with Raj after finding him too needy and vain and declares that she is now in a better relationship.\n\n==== Dan ====\n[[File:StephenRootFeb09.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Stephen Root]]]]\n\nDan ([[Stephen Root]]) is a senior member of staff at Zangen, who first appears in \"The Locomotion Interruption\" when he interviews Penny for a pharmaceutical sales representative position as a favor to Bernadette. Penny realizes that the interview is not going well so she ends it and starts to leave. As a favor, she asks Dan not to tell Bernadette how badly she did because she is kind of scared of her. Dan says that he thought he was the only one who was scared of her. They start to bond, agreeing that Bernadette is something of a bully. Dan comments that she has that squeaky little voice, and that everyone else thinks she is SO nice. He had to cut one of Bernadette's research programs, but was too scared of her to do it. Dan and Penny both agree not to tell Bernadette about the results of the interview. Later Bernadette is talking to Howard at home, and tells him that it is hard to believe, but Penny got the job. She feels that it is because Dan really loves her.\n\nDan reappears in \"The Champagne Reflection\", when Penny makes Bernadette face up to her bullying ways. Dan is still afraid of Bernadette, and tells the story of how she yelled at him and his grandson after they lost the three-legged race at the company picnic. His grandson called her the mean kid with the big boobies. Bernadette is horrified when she realizes how everyone perceives her. Her father had taught her to be tough and she can be cruel with some of her comments without even knowing it. She says she thought she was the sweetest person she knew, and should be in a tree baking cookies like a [[Keebler Company|Keebler]] elf. She goes to apologize to Dan and discovers that, owing to everyone's fear of her, they have been paying for her daily coffee even after the company stopped doing so (something they accomplished with a swear jar kept for Bernadette's sake); and have given her the private use of a toilet that was meant for everyone. She now feels like she has to leave the company and starts crying. Desperate for her to stop, Dan promises to keep paying for her coffee, and even offers to get her an [[espresso machine]]. Bernadette has found a new way to get what she wants.\n\n==== Dave Gibbs ====\n[[File:StephenMerchantAltNov09.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Stephen Merchant]]]]\n\nDave Gibbs ([[Stephen Merchant]]) is a tall British man who dates Amy after she breaks up with Sheldon. Dave is recently divorced because his wife left him for a French chef. When her friends try to find Amy a date on a dating [[Smartphone application|mobile app]], they see a text message from Dave, and Amy reveals they have already gone out together for coffee. Sheldon is about to propose to Amy for closure when he sees Amy and Dave share a kiss after their date. When Amy and Dave later go out again for dinner (while Penny, Bernadette, and a reluctant Leonard spy on them), he shows an unusual fascination with Sheldon, which discomforts Amy. He considers Sheldon and Leonard to be physics superstars and idolizes them. He later gets an opportunity to meet Leonard and shake his hand after Leonard has to relieve himself while spying on their date, and with great excitement, Dave announces that he will never again wash his hand. After Sheldon rejects Amy's proposal that they be a couple again, Amy once again tries dinner with Dave, who goes out of his way to refrain from mentioning Sheldon, knowing how uncomfortable that subject made her previously. Sheldon then suddenly arrives and professes his love to Amy, and the two mend their relationship, leaving Dave to awkwardly excuse himself and invite Sheldon to meet again on his way out.\n\n==== Denise ====\n[[File:Lapkus.JPG|thumb|upright|[[Lauren Lapkus]]]]\n\nDenise ([[Lauren Lapkus]]) is the assistant manager at Stuart's comic book store introduced in [[The Big Bang Theory (season 10)|season 10]]. She is quite a comic book geek. At first, Sheldon doesn't like the change that her hiring brings to the store, but starts to like her because of her comic book knowledge and her ability to figure out his preferences in comic books. After being annoyed by Sheldon's praising of Denise, Amy goes down to the bookstore to demand that Denise teach her enough about comics to make it appear that she likes them.  In \"The Bow Tie Asymmetry\", Stuart asks her to come to Sheldon and Amy's Wedding with him. Denise declines until she learns that Star Wars actor Mark Hamill is going to be there. She sits besides Stuart at the wedding and watches as he answers questions about Star Wars better than Mark Hamill. Denise is amazed by his knowledge and calls him hot. A relationship starts between Denise and Stuart in \"The Wedding Gift Wormhole\". They spend time together and enjoyed each other's company though Stuart is insecure about their relationship. Denise invites Stuart to move in, but he backs off not wanting to ruin their relationship. In episode twenty-two of season 12, \"The Maternal Conclusion\", they move in together after convincing Denise's creepy roommate Mitch to move out.\n\n==== Eric Gablehauser ====\nEric Gablehauser ([[Mark Harelik]]) is the head of the Physics Department, the group's boss at the university. When he first starts working at the university, he fires Sheldon after Sheldon insults his intelligence. Eventually, Gablehauser rehires Sheldon after he and Sheldon's mother display a mutual romantic interest. Gablehauser later hosts the Physics Bowl,<ref name=\"S01E13\">{{Cite episode|title=The Bat Jar Conjecture|episodelink=List of The Big Bang Theory episodes#ep13|series=The Big Bang Theory|serieslink=The Big Bang Theory|date=April 21, 2008|season=1|number=13}}</ref> and gives Raj attention when he is featured in a [[People Magazine|''People'']] article for discovering [[Planet Bollywood|a planet]].\n\n==== V. M. Koothrappali ====\n[[File:Brian George CFC (cropped).jpg|thumb|upright|[[Brian George]]]]\n\nV. M. Koothrappali ([[Brian George]]) is Raj's father in India. His wife and he communicate with their son via Skype and constantly try to arrange dates for him. They want their son to marry a woman of Indian descent, and give them grandchildren.<ref name=\"S01E08\" /> Although in many episodes Raj mentions that he grew up in poverty, his friends remind him of the contrary by pointing out that Dr. Koothrappali is a [[gynecologist]], drives a [[Bentley]], and employs servants.<ref name=\"S02E04\"/> In one such episode, Raj replies that the Bentley is leased and there are only four servants in his family home, two of whom are [[child labour|children]]. Dr. Koothrappali enjoys ''[[Doogie Howser, M.D.|Doogie Howser]]'' reruns, which are apparently new to India.<ref name=\"S01E08\">{{Cite episode|title=The Grasshopper Experiment|episodelink=List of The Big Bang Theory episodes#ep8|series=The Big Bang Theory|serieslink=The Big Bang Theory|date=November 12, 2007|season=1|number=8}}</ref><ref name=\"S02E04\">{{Cite episode|title=The Griffin Equivalency|episodelink=List of The Big Bang Theory episodes#ep21|series=The Big Bang Theory|serieslink=The Big Bang Theory|date=October 13, 2008|season=2|number=4}}</ref> Other than Raj, he also maintains contact with their daughter Priya via Skype whenever she is out of India. In season four, Dr. Koothrappali becomes angry with Leonard when he learns that his daughter, Priya, is dating Leonard without his knowledge. According to Sheldon, the Koothrappalis are \"[[Richie Rich (comics)|Richie Rich]] rich\".\n\nThe Koothrappalis go through a rough patch in their marriage, culminating in them separating in season eight around the time of their 40th wedding anniversary, with Dr. Koothrappali moving out and Mrs. Koothrappali setting fire to his car. Dr. Koothrappali makes his first physical appearance on the show in season eight, visiting the main characters at a Christmas party after the divorce. Dr. Koothrappali later cuts off Raj financially when he buys a helicopter drone, but Raj manages to turn the situation around by pitting his father against his mother. He also asks his father to give advice to a nervous, pregnant Bernadette.\n\nIn \"The Allowance Evaporation\", Raj after meeting his ex-girlfriends who said he was too spoiled and a momma's boy, tells his father that he was no longer taking any money from him. His father was delighted that his last only unmarried offspring was going to stand on his own two feet.\n\nIn \"The Wedding Gift Wormhole\", it's revealed that he is dating again and decides to set up Raj with a woman for an arranged marriage. \n\nHe returns in \"The Propagation Proposition\" via video chat after Raj broke up with Anu and was angry about any money he lost due to the wedding being cancelled.\n\n==== Mrs. Koothrappali ====\n[[File:Alice Amter and Jos\u00e9 Yenque.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Alice Amter]] (left)]]\n\nMrs. Koothrappali ([[Alice Amter]]) is Raj's mother in India. Mrs. Koothrappali is especially worried that, despite Raj being old enough to marry, the closest they have to a daughter-in-law is \"that little Jewish boy Howard\".<ref name=\"S03E06\">{{cite episode|title=The Cornhusker Vortex|episodelink=List of The Big Bang Theory episodes#46|series=The Big Bang Theory|serieslink=The Big Bang Theory|date=November 2, 2009|season=3|number=6}}</ref> She enjoys ''[[Doogie Howser, M.D.|Doogie Howser]]'' reruns, which are apparently new to India.<ref name=\"S01E08\" /><ref name=\"S02E04\" /> Other than Raj, she also maintains contact with Priya via video chat whenever she is out of India. She also had some anger towards Leonard when it became apparent that he was dating Priya without her knowledge.\n\nFollowing their divorce in season eight, Raj mentions that his mother bought the book ''[[Eat, Pray, Love]]'' and used it to set fire to her ex-husband's car. Mrs. Koothrappali makes her first physical appearance on the show in \"The Graduation Transmission\", where Raj uses the Koothrappali's divorce to get money from her when his father cuts him off financially, and pits her against her ex-husband.\n\n==== Janine Davis ====\n[[File:Regina King 2010.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Regina King]]]]\n\nJanine Davis ([[Regina King]]) is a human resources representative working at the university. She first appears in season six after Sheldon offends his assistant Alex while trying to solve a problem regarding her crush on Leonard, leaving Mrs. Davis to handle Alex's sexual-harassment complaint against Sheldon. Sheldon tells Mrs. Davis his belief that she, like all women, is a \"slave\" to her sexual \"urges\", unaware that his remarks are racist and sexist. In his attempt at defense, Sheldon rats out what he considers similar behavior by Raj, Howard, and Leonard, prompting Mrs. Davis to summon them to her office, as well. Mrs. Davis later serves on the [[Academic tenure|tenure]] committee that is considering Raj, Sheldon, Leonard, and Kripke for a vacant tenured position, causing each of them to try to win her favor. Sheldon, in his effort to earn the position, offends her once again by giving her the box set for the miniseries [[Roots (1977 miniseries)|''Roots'']]. Despite this, Sheldon is still short-listed for tenure, even if he offends Mrs. Davis yet again by giving her what he thinks is a traditional handshake originating in African American communities.\n\nIn season seven, Mrs. Davis says that she is recently divorced because her husband cheated on her, and Raj attempts to strike up a conversation with her at a university mixer. After offending her, Raj apologizes, and the two talk about their troubles. Following the mixer, while Raj is insistent that Mrs. Davis and he had a \"moment\", Howard disagrees. Mrs. Davis makes another appearance in season 8, where she informs Sheldon that he has to teach a class as a junior professor, and in season 11, has to deal with Leonard after he gives an embarrassing interview on the radio about the university.\n\n==== Kurt ====\nKurt ([[Brian Patrick Wade]]) is a tall, intimidating bodybuilder and Penny's ex-boyfriend at the beginning of the series. In the pilot, Penny reveals that he cheated on her, and Leonard and Sheldon later go to his apartment and attempt to retrieve Penny's television set from him, but they were unsuccessful and Kurt apparently found them so irritating that they returned home [[Debagging|without pants]].<ref name=\"S01E01\">{{Cite episode|title=Pilot|episodelink=List of The Big Bang Theory episodes#ep1|series=The Big Bang Theory|serieslink=The Big Bang Theory|date=September 24, 2007|season=1|number=1}}</ref> Kurt is invited to Penny's Halloween party, for which he dresses up as a caveman, where he has yet another run in with Leonard, who is dressed as a [[hobbit]].

After Leonard learns about Penny's problems, he tries to help her cut expenses, and in the process learns that Kurt owes her $1800. Without telling Penny, Leonard and the guys go to Kurt's place to collect the money, but they are unsuccessful, and Kurt writes \"I owe Penny $1800 ~ Kurt\" on Leonard's forehead in indelible ink. Later, Penny reveals that Kurt visited her the next morning and paid her, in turn. However, much to Leonard's disappointment, Kurt never told Penny about Leonard's visit, and instead took the opportunity to ask Penny out for dinner.<ref name=\"S02E14\">{{Cite episode|title=The Financial Permeability|episodelink=List of The Big Bang Theory episodes#ep31|series=The Big Bang Theory|serieslink=The Big Bang Theory|date=February 2, 2009|season=2|number=14}}</ref> However, the date apparently does not go anywhere as Kurt is never seen or mentioned again.\n\n==== Lucy ====\n[[File:Kate Miccuci GFDL cropped 2.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Kate Micucci]]]]\n\nLucy ([[Kate Micucci]]) shows up at a party at the comic-book store on Valentine's Day at an event for people who had no dates. She has social anxiety issues, which allows Raj and her to connect. On their first date, she becomes so nervous that she goes to the bathroom and climbs out of the window to get away. Raj falls apart and refuses to leave his apartment; however, after apologizing to him, Lucy and Raj start afresh. Raj and Lucy have a date at a library and communicate by text messages, and at the end, she offers to kiss him, but chickens out at the last second. In \"The Bon Voyage Reaction\", Raj tries to introduce Lucy to the rest of the gang. Lucy becomes nervous at the thought of meeting so many new people that Raj suggests she meet just one of his friends first, to which she agrees. Lucy meets Amy, but Raj pressures Lucy and upsets her. Lucy breaks up with Raj by an email, and afterwards a heartbroken Raj finally speaks to Penny without having consumed alcohol. Originally, Kate Micucci had been one of the actresses considered for the Amy Farrah Fowler character.\n\nIn season seven, Penny meets Lucy at the Cheesecake Factory and confronts her about her breakup with Raj, and later Lucy arranges to meet with Raj to apologize to him for breaking up with him via email. This leads Raj to believe the two of them will get back together, but Lucy tells him she is with someone else. Although she is not seen, Lucy later texts Raj saying that she misses him and wants to get back together, but after finding out that he is also dating Emily, Lucy rebuffs Raj.\n\nLucy appears in season 10, where Raj invites her to his apartment along with his other ex-girlfriends to find out why he is still single. Lucy mentions that she is now in a better relationship.\n\n==== Mike Rostenkowski ====\nMike Rostenkowski ([[Casey Sander]]) is Bernadette's father and a tough retired police officer. Mike has a rough and rude personality and often bullies others, although he deeply loves his daughter, calling Bernadette his \"little girl\". Before he is first seen, Bernadette establishes his personality by telling Howard a long list of subjects he cannot discuss with Mike, including [[Jimmy Carter]], foreigners, homosexuals, and even Howard's Jewish identity.\n\nIn his first appearance, he tells Howard that, while he does not think highly of him, his respect for Howard grew when he learned he had been selected to become an astronaut. However, after Howard expresses his fears about not returning from space, Mike tells him not to worry as Bernadette will have no trouble finding another suitable bachelor if Howard dies in space, much to the future astronaut's dismay. In the season-five finale, Mike attends Howard and Bernadette's wedding and walks his daughter down the aisle.\n\nIn season six, Howard and Mike are pushed into a fishing weekend by their spouses, but neither man really wants to go. Mike suggests that they go to a casino to shoot craps. Having earned more of Mike's respect, Howard is now able to address him as \"Mike\" rather than \"Sir\".\n\nIn season seven, because his wife is out of town, Bernadette gets Mike to come to Howard's mother's house for Thanksgiving dinner, though he would rather watch football at home. Since Sheldon understands football from growing up with his father, Mike and Sheldon bond and drink heavily together. After insulting Howard, Mike later tells Howard that he is not \"all that bad\", but implies that this statement is untrue when he comments on his drunken state. In \"The Table Polarization\", Mike, Bernadette, Raj, and Mike Massimino (via Skype) perform an intervention on Howard's decision to go back to space. Mike mentions that Howard asked him to shoot him in the foot to avoid the first space mission, which Howard insists was a joke.\n\nIn season nine, he comes to Howard and Bernadette's house since they are talking about renovating and he comes over to help. While Howard and he are busy under the foundations of the house, Mike asks Howard why he does not want kids, but Howard sets things straight when he tells Mike that it is actually Bernadette who does not want kids. In the room above, Bernadette overhears this and tries to drown out the conversation by yelling \"Earthquake!\" and drumming her feet on the floor, causing a dust avalanche on both of them. Bernadette had lied to her father about not wanting kids because she did not want to disappoint him. Mike says he does not want to see her miss out since raising children was the most rewarding experience of his life, but Bernadette points out that her mother did everything while all Mike did was come home from work, sit on the couch, and drink beer, which is unrelated to raising kids. Defeated, Mike leaves, saying this is really a conversation for husband and wife and tells Bernadette if her mother asks, he was at the Wolowitz house until 10. He briefly comes back into the kitchen and sees Howard and Bernadette doing \"dirty talk\" and then disappears again through the doorway.\n\n==== President Siebert ====\n[[File:Joshua Malina 2013.JPG|thumb|upright|[[Joshua Malina]]]]\n\nPresident Siebert ([[Joshua Malina]]) is the [[California_Institute_of_Technology#Presidents|president]] of the [[California Institute of Technology]]. He is married and has a daughter. Siebert is often mentioned by Sheldon. A recurring gag is that Sheldon often calls or visits Siebert in the middle of the night to get information, and usually gets a bitter response. Siebert sends Sheldon on the expedition to the North Pole at the end of season two.\n\nIn his first appearance, Siebert organizes a get-together with wealthy donors and faculty members to garner funds for the university's programs. He urges the guys to make an appearance to schmooze the donors so they will give to their projects. Seeing Sheldon's behavior toward the donors, he asks that he not appear again.\n\nIn season five, Siebert forces Sheldon to use up his vacation days, and when Sheldon and Kripke [[The Rothman Disintegration|battle for an office]] at the university, they interrupt Siebert at a urinal to get him to make a decision on who gets the office.\n\nIn season eleven, the President returns and is very excited about Sheldon and Amy's asymmetry string theory paper. He helps them promote it and submitting a Nobel Prize nominations for the two of them.\n\n==== Priya Koothrappali ====\nPriya Koothrappali ([[Aarti Mann]]) is Raj's younger sister. Having graduated at the top of her class at the [[University of Cambridge]] (where like Leonard, her roommate was from Texas), she is one of the lead attorneys at India's biggest car company.\n\nIn her first appearance, Priya has a two-day layover and comes to visit her brother. Leonard and she are revealed to have had a relationship five years earlier (without her parents' or Raj's knowledge) when she was in town, and that Leonard had been much more invested in the relationship than she was. Leonard even offered to relocate to New Delhi to be with her. He tries to keep their relationship a secret from the guys, but Sheldon discovers Priya in their apartment after spending the night together. Leonard eventually reveals to the rest of the guys that he spent the night with Priya, as he is unable to bear the burden of keeping the secret.<ref>{{cite episode|title=The Irish Pub Formulation|episodelink=The Big Bang Theory (season 4)#ep69|series=The Big Bang Theory|serieslink=The Big Bang Theory|network=[[CBS]]|date=October 28, 2010|season=4|number=6|minutes=}}</ref> Priya returns to Los Angeles for business in \"The Cohabitation Formulation\", and Leonard and she decide to try to have a real relationship, over the protests of Raj. It upsets both Raj, knowing that his sister is having sex with one of his best friends (sometimes in Raj's bed), and Penny, who is revealed to harbour unresolved feelings for Leonard. Priya soon becomes jealous of Penny and asks Leonard to stop spending time with her, which causes Penny, Amy, and Bernadette to hate her. Priya contests Sheldon's roommate agreement with Leonard, employing her legal background to deny Sheldon power over him, but upon Amy's advice, Sheldon drafts a new agreement and blackmails Leonard into signing it by threatening to tell Priya's parents she is dating Leonard, which she cannot bear because they want her to date an Indian (although her father would accept her dating Howard due to his belief that Jews are financially savvy and do not drink much). At the end of season four, Leonard overhears her parents claiming that she is moving back to India, which he interprets as the end of their relationship, leading him to expose their secret relationship to her parents.\n\nIn season five, although they are separated, with Priya moving back a month earlier than expected, they nonetheless remain in touch via Skype, having a cyber-dinner/breakfast date. At Howard's suggestion, Leonard and Priya also attempt to simulate intercourse, but when it comes time for her to remove her clothing, Leonard's screen freezes up because of his exceeding the bandwidth. Leonard later manages to get cue cards to help himself with a seduction speech to Priya, but while delivering it to her, he inadvertently reveals to her parents that they are cyber-dating (they were in the same room as she when he called), with them acidly asking for him to continue with the speech.<ref name=\"s05e02\">{{cite episode|title=The Infestation Hypothesis|episodelink=The Infestation Hypothesis|series=The Big Bang Theory|serieslink=The Big Bang Theory|network=[[CBS]]|date=September 22, 2011|season=5|number=2|minutes=}}</ref> In \"The Good Guy Fluctiation\", Leonard tells Priya about his attraction to a comic-book enthusiast named Alice; Priya admits to cheating on him with her former boyfriend, which visibly upsets Leonard.

In the next episode, Leonard refers to himself as single, indicating that Priya and he have broken up as a result of their last conversation.\n\nIn season 10, it is mentioned that out of the six Koothrappali children, only Raj is still single, indicating that Priya has married since her last appearance.\n\n==== Ramona Nowitzki ====\n[[File:Riki Lindhome by Gage Skidmore.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Riki Lindhome]]]]\n\nRamona Nowitzki, Ph.D., ([[Riki Lindhome]]) first appears in the season 2 episode, \"The Cooper\u2013Nowitzki Theorem\", when she is a graduate student at Caltech who is a huge fan of Sheldon's work and develops a near-obsessive crush on him. She meets Sheldon personally in the cafeteria and arranges to have dinner with him in his apartment. Where other people might be worried about such behavior being reminiscent of stalking, Sheldon reacts positively to Ramona by appreciating the fact that he is getting a free dinner. During their date, the rest of the gang is sitting on the couch as spectators of this strange turn of events. She keeps \"helping\" Sheldon by arranging suitable working conditions for him, such as getting breakfast for him at the cafeteria and giving him foot rubs. Unfortunately for Sheldon, she overdoes her insistence that Sheldon dedicate his time solely for work, depriving him of his favorite hobbies such as playing games, watching TV, and going for paintball with the guys. Even more unfortunately for Sheldon, he cannot seem to get rid of her, especially when she settles herself in his apartment. Ramona proves to be irritating for the entire group, especially when she assumes that Penny likes Sheldon. She still asks Penny to be sisters with her. She makes it difficult for anyone to communicate with him and scares them away. Eventually, Sheldon solves the problem he has been working on. Enthusiastic about his solution, he asks Ramona how he can reward her for all her help. But when she asks for him to share credit with her and name the theorem \"Cooper-Nowitzki\", he finally kicks her out of the apartment.\n\nRamona reappears in the season 10 finale. She now has her Ph.D., and has secured a post-doc position at Caltech. Amy is away at [[Princeton University|Princeton]], and the gang becomes worried for Sheldon because Ramona's crush on him begins again. She brings him meals, and eventually kisses him in his office. Finally aware of her advances, Sheldon makes an excuse to leave the office, and promptly flies to New Jersey where he proposes to Amy.\n\nIn the first episode of season 11, Amy shocks Ramona by hugging her, as it was Ramona's advances that prompted Sheldon to propose.\n\n==== Ruchi ====\nRuchi (Swati Kapila); is a new co-worker of Bernadette's at Zangen who first appears in season 11. Ruchi used to live in India, and was in an arranged engagement, until she broke off the engagement and moved to America.\n\nIn her first appearance, Bernadette takes Ruchi out for drinks, though despite Howard's suggestion, refuses to set her up with Raj or Stuart. While out for drinks, Raj and Stuart show up uninvited (after Howard told them where they were) and both take an interest in Ruchi and try to win her over. Raj invites Ruchi out for drinks behind Stuart's back in a bid to get her alone. When Stuart shows up and later throws Raj under the bus, she tells them that she is not interested in dating anybody right now and just wants to make some friends. Raj later bumps into Ruchi at a bar while watching a cricket match with Howard and they eventually hook up. Afterwards, Ruchi wants to keep things casual with Raj, which he has difficult maintaining, especially after a date with her when she reveals that she does not believe in soul mates and sees romantic love more as a bio-chemical reaction. Despite this, Raj continues to see Ruchi to have sex with her. While she is on bed rest, Bernadette becomes convinced that Ruchi is trying to steal her job and asks Raj to investigate her suspicions. After revealing to Raj she is taking over all of Bernadette's projects, Raj tells Bernadette and tries to defend Ruchi like a boyfriend would, pointing out Bernadette's hypocrisy as she would most likely have stolen from other people's projects as well. When she finds out about this, Ruchi is not happy and promptly dumps Raj.\n<!--\n--------------------------------------------------------------\nSo far, Stephanie Barnett appears in only three consecutive episodes.

Stephanie uses sex to manipulate Leonard when he tries to slow down the relationship.

Wil played [[Wesley Crusher]] in ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation]]'', a character that Sheldon idolized as a child. In 1995 Wheaton made Sheldon's \"mortal enemy\" list after Wheaton failed to show up at a fan convention. Sheldon took a 10-hour bus ride to attend the convention and was disappointed that Wheaton was a no-show.\n\nIn season three, Sheldon enters a trading-card game tournament (''Mystic Warlords of Ka'a'') to confront Wheaton. When Sheldon is about to defeat his hated rival, Wheaton tells him that he missed the 1995 \"Dixie Trek\" convention because his grandmother had died. In sympathy, Sheldon deliberately messes up his next move to benefit Wheaton. Wheaton reveals that he lied about his grandmother and then wins the game by taking advantage of the opening Sheldon leaves him. Wheaton later plays in a bowling match against Sheldon, where he uses [[gamesmanship]] again, breaking up Leonard and Penny to win.\n\nIn season four, Wheaton appears at a special screening of ''[[Raiders of the Lost Ark]]'' and uses his celebrity status to go to the front of a long line. This antagonizes Sheldon, who derides him as the \"[[Jar Jar Binks]] of the Star Trek universe\". Wheaton and his entourage effectively prevented Sheldon and his friends from attending the screening when the last seat in the theater went to the person directly in front of them in line. Ultimately, Sheldon steals the reels containing the prints of the film and Wheaton leads a mob of angry audience members after Sheldon.\n\nIn season five, Wheaton invites the guys to a party at his house and appears to be genuinely sorry for his past actions, giving Sheldon a signed Wesley Crusher action figure as a way of thanking Sheldon for being a fan. His gesture is met with a renunciation of his \"mortal enemy\" status and a hug from Sheldon. Wheaton is invited to Howard's bachelor party, where he films the toasts and uploads them to the Internet, getting Howard and Raj in trouble with Bernadette.\n\nIn season six, Wheaton appears in a ''Star Trek''-themed episode of Sheldon's web-series ''[[Fun with Flags]]'' and insults Amy after she criticizes his performance. After Sheldon ditches Amy to spend time with Wheaton, Amy becomes angry with Sheldon, who later unknowingly becomes intoxicated and almost starts a fist fight with Wheaton, demanding an apology.\n\nIn season seven, Amy calls Wheaton to cheer up Sheldon after Leonard disproves Sheldon's scientific discovery. Wheaton later gives Penny advice when she wrestles with whether to take a role in the sequel to a low-budget horror film in which she once starred. After taking the role, Penny finds that Wheaton is also appearing in the film. Wheaton and Penny are both fired from the film after an argument with the director.\n\nIn season eight, Wheaton invites Penny to appear on his [[podcast]], where she talks about her acting career. Leonard and Penny get into an argument on air, much to the amusement of Wheaton.\n\nIn season nine, Wheaton introduces [[Adam Nimoy]], son of Mr. Spock portrayer [[Leonard Nimoy]], to Sheldon, for Sheldon to be interviewed for a documentary that Adam Nimoy is producing about Spock and his impact on popular culture. In a later episode, Wheaton fills in for Sheldon when he joins Leonard, Howard, and Raj for the midnight premiere of ''[[Star Wars: The Force Awakens]]''. When he arrives at the theater, the audience immediately jeers him for dressing as Spock, but Wheaton explains that he did so intentionally because he believes the audience should not take whether the film succeeds or fails so seriously. He appears again to celebrate Sheldon's birthday in the show's 200th episode, \"The Celebration Experimentation\".\n\nIn season eleven, Sheldon wants to replace [[List of The Big Bang Theory characters#Arthur Jeffries|Arthur Jeffries]] in the role of Professor Proton, following Jeffries' death, and asks Wheaton to be his acting coach for the part. However, when Wheaton somehow gets the part instead, Sheldon is dismayed and after many unsuccessful attempts to get his friends to boycott the franchise, he demands that Wheaton turn down the role. Wheaton refuses, claiming he wants to inspire young scientists and Sheldon begins to consider him an enemy again. However, after watching the show Sheldon likes Wheaton's portrayal of Prof. Proton and gets jealous when he sees that Wheaton has brought Howard to be a guest on his show. Although Sheldon apologizes to Wheaton, mending their friendship, Wheaton refuses to bring Sheldon as a guest on his show and instead invites Amy to be a guest on the show. At the end of season eleven, Wil is Sheldon and Amy's first choice to officiate their wedding ceremony, but is replaced when [[Mark Hamill]] becomes available.\n\nIn season twelve episode \"[[The D&D Vortex]]\", Wheaton as Professor Proton invites Sheldon to meet [[William Shatner]], and Sheldon gets so excited that he then proceeds to throw up on him. When Sheldon shows up at Wheaton's house to apologize, Wheaton accepts the apology, but as he is in the middle of a private [[Dungeons & Dragons]] game featuring [[William Shatner]], [[Kareem Abdul-Jabbar]], [[Kevin Smith]], [[Joe Manganiello]] and Stuart, he shuts Sheldon out. When the guys find out about the game, they get Stuart to quit and Wheaton invites Leonard, asking him not to tell anyone. Leonard then tells Penny and she tells Amy and Bernadette; the girls stalk Wheaton in an attempt to get themselves invited when they hear that Manganiello from [[Magic Mike]] will be there. Because of that indiscretion, Wil kicks out Leonard and admonishes the guys for using him for his connections, and says that one of the worst things about being a celebrity is not knowing whether someone will like him for himself. To apologize, the guys invite Wil to play D&D with them at Leonard's apartment, but Wil, secretly in the middle of a game with Penny, Amy and Bernadette and the group, politely turns them down but offers to arrange for another time. Penny sits next to Shatner telling him he tells \"Grandpa Jokes\" and Bernadette tells Abdul-Jabbar how she and her father used to watch him, while Amy creeps out Manganiello and is moved away from him. Wheaton then allows them all to take a photo together and send it to the guys as payback, which Leonard himself admits they all deserved.\n\nWil Wheaton, [[LeVar Burton]], Leonard Nimoy (in voice-over only), [[Brent Spiner]], [[William Shatner]] and [[George Takei]] have all appeared on the show, making the ''Star Trek'' franchise the most represented franchise on the show in terms of guest appearances.\n\n==== Marissa Johnson ====\nMarissa Johnson ([[Lindsey Kraft]]) is married to Penny's ex-boyfriend, [[#Zack Johnson|Zack Johnson]]. They meet with Leonard and Penny and they want Leonard to father their child since Zack is infertile.\n\n==== Mrs. Wolowitz ====\nMrs. Debbie<ref>{{cite episode|title=The Status Quo Combustion|episodelink=The Big Bang Theory (season 7)#ep79|series=The Big Bang Theory|serieslink=The Big Bang Theory|network=[[CBS]]|date=May 15, 2014|season=7|number=24|minutes=20:01}}</ref> Malvina<ref>{{cite episode|title=The Birthday Synchronicity|series=The Big Bang Theory|network=[[CBS]]|date=December 15, 2016|season=10|number=11}}</ref> Wolowitz (voiced by [[Carol Ann Susi]]) is Howard's over-protective, controlling, belittling, but loving and caring [[Jewish mother stereotype|stereotypical Jewish mother]]. The character is [[Unseen character|not shown on-screen]] with the exception of [[The Big Bang Theory (season 6)#ep126|one episode in season six]] in which her body, but not face, is briefly shown. Mrs. Wolowitz's raspy voice is heard usually in scenes at her house, which she shares with Howard. She talks to Howard always by yelling at him from another room, which results in awkward conversations with Howard yelling back at her. In a flashback, when the guys hear her yelling in a masculine voice, they ask Howard if that was his father, to which Howard replies, \"If she grows any more hair on her face, yes\".\n\nMrs. Wolowitz is also described as being enormously obese and wearing a wig and painted-on eyebrows. She seems to be oblivious to Howard's work as an engineer and treats him as though he is still a child. She is a master at Wheel of Fortune and guessing answers at game shows. She frequently refers to Leonard, Sheldon, and Raj as Howard's \"little friends\" (as in, \"I made some cookies and Hawaiian Punch for you and your little friends!\") and often refers to Caltech as a \"school\". Howard often makes references to his mother as being a \"crazy old lady\", but deep down, he is deeply attached to his mother and quite happy to be treated like a child. She is also noted to be on [[hormone replacement therapy]], and she wants to \"[[Playing doctor|play doctor]]\" with Raj when he asks to sleep over.\n\nWhen Howard reveals that he has proposed to Bernadette and she has accepted, she collapses, causing Howard to panic and dislocate his shoulder while trying to barge into the bathroom to help her. The timing leads him to believe that she may not like Bernadette (who is Catholic) and has suffered a heart attack from the shock of the news. In actuality, her fainting was due to food poisoning from the food she ate while meeting Bernadette and was completely unrelated to Howard's news. She has graciously accepted Bernadette as her daughter-in-law and is impressed by Bernadette's doctorate.\n\nIn an early episode, Howard attempts to move out after a fight with his mother, but has serious delusions that she is trying to force him to stay, when in actuality, she is urging him to move out, which leads to him staying. However, at the beginning of season six, she is so angry and upset about Howard moving in with Bernadette that she cries at the thought of being lonely, prompting him to promise he'll convince Bernadette to move into their house instead. However, Bernadette remains firm but once Howard has finally moved out of his mother's house, he tells her a story about inviting his mother to be an assistant during his magic tricks as a child, helping her forget her loneliness, making Bernadette feel guilty and decide that she and Howard should sleep over at his mother's house from time to time to remind her that she is not alone. Later in the season, Howard asks Raj to look in on his mother to make sure she is okay while he and Bernadette are out on a trip. Raj enjoys dinner with her but as he is about to leave, she cries at being lonely, causing a sympathetic Raj to stay for dessert. He ends up sleeping in Howard's old bedroom, but once Howard warns him that his mother will use her loneliness and mother him in a desperate attempt to make him stay, he attempts to escape but is caught by her.\n\nIn season seven, Mrs. Wolowitz breaks her leg and keeps driving away the nurses hired to care for her. Even Penny rejects the job of caregiver after a very short time. After Stuart's comic-book store burns down, Howard invites Stuart to work for Mrs. Wolowitz; however, they develop a strange relationship, much to Howard's annoyance. Howard is also upset about the fact that now she dotes more heavily on Stuart, getting him premium cable, new clothes, money to rebuild the comic book store and even recording an answering machine message with him.\n\nFollowing the death of Carol Ann Susi, producers decided that Mrs. Wolowitz would die in the season-eight episode \"The Comic Book Store Regeneration\". Howard receives a phone call while in the store from his aunt Gladys in Florida, whom Mrs. Wolowitz had gone to visit. She says that Mrs. Wolowitz lay down for a nap and never woke up afterwards. Howard and Bernadette then move back into Howard's old home, and Stuart decides to stay with them. He eventually moves out halfway through season nine, allowing them to redecorate. Mrs. Wolowitz is also in the season-eleven episode \u201cThe Bitcoin Entanglement\u201d.\n\n==== Wyatt ====\n[[File:Aspettando Clint Keith Carradine fcm.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Keith Carradine]]]]\n\nWyatt ([[Keith Carradine]]) is Penny's father. He comes to visit, and Penny feels compelled to involve Leonard in a ruse to make him think they are still together. (Wyatt reveals that he favors the successful Leonard over Penny's other \"loser\" boyfriends.) When the plot is revealed, he gets mad at Penny and feigns anger at Leonard, but after Penny leaves the room, he encourages Leonard to keep trying to get Penny back (because he wants his grandchildren to \"grow up in a house without wheels\"). Strangely, though, in the first episode where Leonard's mother visits, Penny tearfully reveals her rough childhood, saying that Wyatt wanted a boy and even called her \"slugger\" until she reached puberty. Wyatt appears again in season nine, when Penny finally plucks up the courage to tell her father she eloped with Leonard. Wyatt is happy, but he also confesses that he killed Penny's pet pig a year ago. In the season 10 premiere, \"The Conjugal Conjecture\", he comes to Pasadena with his wife and son to attend Leonard and Penny's re-wedding and during the ceremony he walks Penny down the aisle, welcomes Leonard to their family and advises him not to lend Penny's brother any money.\n\n==== Zack Johnson ====\nZack Johnson ([[Brian Thomas Smith]]) is a dim-witted but friendly [[beefcake]]-type whom Penny dates on and off after her second break-up with Leonard. Zack works as the menu designer for restaurants that are owned by or which have hired his father's company to design their menus.\n\nIn season three, Leonard invites Penny and Zack up to the roof to watch his experiment of bouncing laser beams off the moon; Zack misunderstands what is happening, and thinks they are going to blow up the moon.<ref name=\"S03E23\">{{Cite episode|title=The Lunar Excitation|episodelink=List of The Big Bang Theory episodes#ep63|series=The Big Bang Theory|serieslink=The Big Bang Theory|date=May 24, 2010|season=3|number=23}}</ref> Later, Penny and Zach go out to a party, but she is so put off at how stupid he is that she runs back to Leonard for sex, saying he ruined her ability to tolerate stupid men.\n\nIn season four, Zack runs into Penny, Bernadette, and Amy at a restaurant, and Amy becomes physically attracted to him. Sheldon arranges a meeting between Zack and Amy to satisfy her \"urges\", but his lack of intellect immediately discourages Amy. Unlike Penny's other boyfriends, Zack considers Leonard, Howard, Sheldon, and Raj (whom he calls \"the science dudes\") to be \"cool\" and makes a genuine effort to get to know them, even treating them as his friends. After accompanying them on a trip to the comic-book store (where Raj and he bond over a mutual fondness for ''[[Archie Comics|Archie]]'' comics), he enters a New Year's Eve costume party with them, portraying [[Superman]] in their version of the [[Justice League]]. In \"The Toast Derivation\", Sheldon invites him over for a party, where he bonds with Kripke and Stuart, as well.\n\nIn season seven, it is discovered that Zack and Penny have been unknowingly married for three years after the two were intoxicated and attended a wedding chapel in [[Las Vegas]] (they were not aware that weddings in Las Vegas are real). Penny invites him to Mrs. Wolowitz's house for [[Thanksgiving]], where they get the marriage annulled.\n\nIn season nine, episode 22, Zack's observations indicate he is, in some respects, more observant and smarter than \"the science dudes\".\n\nIn season ten, episode 22, Zack and his fianc\u00e9e, Sarah, plan a double date with Penny and Leonard, but Sarah does not turn up. Zack offers Penny a job at his menu printing company which she accepts, but when she calls Zack he tells her that Sarah is uncomfortable with them working together.\n\nIn season eleven, episode 9, it is revealed that seven years prior, Penny gave Zack Leonard's old laptop, which Leonard had given her while they were dating. Penny and Leonard arrive at Zack's apartment to retrieve the laptop, where he shows them that Penny had made a video she intended to send to Leonard apologizing for their break-up.\n\nIn season twelve, episode 12, Penny runs into Zack again after he buys her, Bernadette and Amy drinks. He reveals that he has sold his menu company and become rich from the profits, and invites her and Leonard to dinner at his yacht with him and his new wife, [[#Marissa Johnson|Marissa Johnson]]. Penny and Leonard proceed to make fun of the newlyweds on how dumb they are until Zack and Marissa ask Leonard to be their sperm donor in hopes of conceiving a child. Because Penny said that she never wants children, Penny and Leonard argue about the situation, but eventually Penny agrees to support whatever decision Leonard makes. In season twelve, episode 15, Leonard ultimately cannot go through with it and tells Zack to ask Sheldon, whom declines after Amy is outraged at the idea.\n\n=== ''Young Sheldon'' supporting characters ===\n==== Billy Sparks ====\nBilly Sparks (Wyatt McLure) is a boy who lives with his parents and sister next to the Coopers and Meemaw. He has been mentioned in ''The Big Bang Theory'' as one of Sheldon's childhood bullies, although in ''Young Sheldon'' he is rather good-natured and at times is friends with Sheldon, but is shown to be extremely dim-witted and simple-minded.\n\n==== Brenda Sparks ====\nBilly Sparks's mother who works at the bowling alley frequented by Meemaw. She is not a very pleasant person and often clashes with Mary.\n\n==== Dale Ballard ====\nCoach Dale Ballard ([[Craig T. Nelson]]) is a baseball coach who lets Missy play after he says no and Meemaw intervenes. He also ends up dating Meemaw after her breakup with Dr. Sturgis.\n\n==== Dr. John Sturgis ====\nDr. John Sturgis ([[Wallace Shawn]]) is a physics professor at the university East Texas Tech that Sheldon attends part-time. Dr. Sturgis is initially a pen pal of Sheldon Cooper, before the child prodigy audits his {{w|quantum chromodynamics}} course. Dr. Sturgis is instantly smitten with Sheldon's Meemaw and they begin dating, much to Sheldon's approval, but also to Sheldon's urging.\n\nHe is also rather childish like going to bed at 7:30 and asking Meemaw's permission to do things as if she were his mother.\n\n==== Herschel Sparks ====\nHerschel Sparks ([[Billy Gardell]]) is a neighbor of the Cooper family and Meemaw, the husband of Brenda Sparks, and the father of Billy and Bobbi Sparks. He runs his own garage, where he offers Georgie a part-time job. Georgie turns out to be a wonderful employee, something that makes George and Herschel happy and stunned. Herschel is often bossed around by his wife, something that he and George bond over since George is often bossed around by Mary as well.\n\n==== Paige ====\nPaige ([[Mckenna Grace]]) is a 10-year-old child prodigy whom Sheldon meets in one of his classes with Dr. Sturgis. She turns out to be a bit smarter than him and this causes Dr. Sturgis to pay attention a lot to her, something that makes Sheldon jealous, so Meemaw has to step in. Unlike Sheldon, she is very sweet, has excellent social skills, and is capable of being friends with non-intellectuals, as is reflected in her friendship with Missy.\n\n==== Tam Nguyen ====\nTam Nguyen (Ryan Phuong \u2013 YS / [[Robert Wu]] \u2013 TBBT) is a Vietnamese-American boy who, in ''Young Sheldon'', is Sheldon's classmate and only friend. His father Le Nguyen, and mother Trang Nguyen, run a store called \"Medford Mart\". He has two sisters, Mai and Kim-Ly. \n\nTam laments his difficult childhood in war-torn Vietnam, which included his father being incarcerated in a detention camp, and his encounter with the [[Ku Klux Klan]] when he first arrived in America. Tam takes his frustration out on other people, such as Sheldon's father George. He has a troubled relationship with his parents, having been treated badly by both of them after moving to the United States. The episode \"A Loaf of Bread and a Grand Old Flag\" suggests that Tam has a good relationship with his sisters, as he talks about starting a [[labor union]] with them and taking their parents to court.\n\nBy the time of ''The Big Bang Theory'', Sheldon and Tam are no longer friends. In the Season 12 episode \"The Tam Turbulence\", they met up again after not speaking in 20 years. When Leonard, Howard and Raj find out about Tam, having never previously heard of him, they try to meet him. They do so at Caltech, assuming that Sheldon was to blame for the end of the friendship. It turns out that when Sheldon was moving to California he had asked Tam to move there with him; Tam agreed, but after meeting a girl named Beth decided to stay in Texas instead. He and Beth married soon after and had one son and at least one other child.\n\nSheldon and Tam make up at the end of episode with Tam saying that he has been happy with Beth and their children all these years and has had a very happy life overall, in contrast to his abusive childhood.\n\n==== Veronica Duncan ====\nVeronica Duncan ([[Isabel May]]) is Georgie Cooper's most significant love interest on ''Young Sheldon''. \n\nInitially introduced as a popular and \"easy\" girl, Veronica becomes a devout Christian after going through a \"[[Seven Deadly Sins|Sin]] [[Haunted attraction (simulated)|House]]\" one Halloween. Georgie is obsessed with her and frequently takes every advantage he can to be close to her or impress her in any way, such as agreeing to be baptized with her (only to attempt \u2013 comically and painfully unsuccessfully \u2013 to steal a kiss), defend her against an abusive step-parent (after Mary had taken her in), or coming up with a series of get-rich-quick schemes to buy her expensive gifts (which she rejects, though she seems more receptive towards a bracelet made of the candy he was selling in his latest scheme).\n\n== Minor characters ==\n[[File:Judd Hirsch (edited).jpg|thumb|Judd Hirsch]]\n* Dr. Alfred Hofstadter ([[Judd Hirsch]]): Leonard's father, an anthropologist who once worked with famed archaeologist [[Louis Leakey]] (Leonard's middle name is Leakey in consequence). He was miserable in his marriage to Leonard's mother Beverly, who was always annoying and was unmotherly towards their children. Alfred claimed she was cold and emasculating, and had not shown him any physical affection for years. When Leonard was six, he walked in on his parents naked, and she was swatting his rear end with Leonard's brand-new ping-pong paddle, and as a result in season three, the two were revealed to be getting divorced after he had had an affair with a waitress. In his first appearance in \"The Convergence-Convergence\" during his visit for Leonard and Penny's rewedding, he meets Mary Cooper and the two get along great as they have each other's nice, gentle, and caring personalities, bonding over their mutual dislike of Beverly, and their admiration of each other's beliefs. The two of them end up fighting with Beverly at the restaurant during the pre-ceremony dinner and the two leave together and after finding out they are staying at the same hotel, they decide to share a cab and it is implied that the two hook up. In \"The Conjugal Conjecture\", Alfred is revealed to have not slept with Mary, but they still plan on seeing each other in the future. In the ceremony, he says that though Beverly and he do not bring the best out in each other, something wonderful did come out of their relationship: Leonard. Beverly agrees. On the way to the airport, they appear to be civil for about a minute until they start bickering over Leonard's driving.\n* {{visible anchor|Althea Robinson}} ([[Vernee Watson-Johnson|Vernee Watson]]): makes an appearance in [[Pilot (The Big Bang Theory)|the pilot episode]] as an attendant at a [[sperm bank]], and then makes three appearances as an emergency room nurse in \"[[The Peanut Reaction]]\" episode (season one) and \"[[The Big Bang Theory (season 4)#ep64|The Robotic Manipulation]]\" episode (season four), and as a ward nurse in \"[[The Big Bang Theory (season 5)#ep105|The Werewolf Transformation]]\" (season five).

In the series finale, she finally made an onscreen appearance and she resembles her mother.\n* Neil Michael Wolowitz, Howard and Bernadette's baby son, born in the episode \"[[The Neonatal Nomenclature]]\". Hours before his birth, Howard is unhappy that Bernadette has already decided to name the baby after her father, Michael, without consulting him first.

Eventually Howard and Bernadette compromise as she gives birth to Neil, after Neil Armstrong and Neil Diamond, with Michael as the middle name. Bernadette still wants to call the baby Michael as a nickname, and Howard doesn't argue with her because of the baby's large head.
