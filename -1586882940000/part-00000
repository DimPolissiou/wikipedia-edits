Simultaneously, he also held various positions in the royal court.\n\n==Ancestry==\nPaul was born around 1227.{{sfn|Mark\u00f3|2006|p=320}} His parentage is unknown. He had two brothers, including Benedict, who served as ''[[isp\u00e1n]]'' of [[Veszpr\u00e9m County (former)|Veszpr\u00e9m County]] in 1269.{{sfn|Zsoldos|2011|p=227}} He was called Benedict of \u00c1rma in 1266, after his ownership of a village in [[Bars County]] (present-day an uninhabited waste in [[M\u00e1la\u0161]], [[Slovakia]]). Paul's another, unidentified brother was the father of his [[Paul Balog, Bishop of P\u00e9cs|namesake nephew]], who was elevated into the dignity of [[Bishop of P\u00e9cs]] at the turn of the 13th and 14th centuries. Benedict had two sons, Michael and Paul.{{sfn|Zsoldos|2011|pp=341\u2013342}}\n\nSeveral historians consider that Paul and his family belonged to the Sz\u00e9csi branch of the [[Balog (genus)|''gens'' (clan) Balog]],{{sfn|Mark\u00f3|2006|p=320}} based on the 15th-century [[Order of Saint Paul the First Hermit|Pauline friar]] Gergely Gy\u00f6ngy\u00f6si's ''Vitae fratrum Eremitarum Ordinis Sancti Pauli Primi Eremitae'',{{sfn|V\u00e9kony|1991|p=365}} but it is not without doubt. Historian Gyula Pauler claimed Paul originated from the [[T\u00e9t\u00e9ny (genus)|clan T\u00e9t\u00e9ny]], but his contemporary, genealogist J\u00e1nos Kar\u00e1csonyi, refused this. [[Gy\u00f6rgy Gy\u00f6rffy]] argued the \"\u00c1rma branch\" of the ''gens'' [[Hont-P\u00e1zm\u00e1ny]] consisted of Paul and his brothers, but [[P\u00e1l Engel]] did not connect them to the widely extended kindred in his genealogical work.{{sfn|Zsoldos|2011|pp=341\u2013342}} Archaeologist [[G\u00e1bor V\u00e9kony]] assumed Paul might be a member of the [[Szal\u00f3k (genus)|''gens'' Szal\u00f3k]].{{sfn|V\u00e9kony|1991|p=375}} Nevertheless, the majority of historians accepted that both prelates with the name Paul came from the Balog kindred.{{sfn|Mark\u00f3|2006|p=320}}\n\n==Early career==\nAccording to historian Istv\u00e1n Hajnal, Paul was identical with that namesake clergyman, who was referred to as royal chaplain and papal vicar in the court of [[B\u00e9la IV of Hungary]] in 1245. However, that document later proved to be a forgery. It is also possible he is identical with that royal chaplain Paul, who was entrusted by the king to arrange in the possession matters of the [[Hah\u00f3t (genus)|''gens'' Hah\u00f3t]] in [[Zala County (former)|Zala County]], assisting the work of ''isp\u00e1n'' [[Arnold II Hah\u00f3t|Arnold Hah\u00f3t]] in 1237 (of course, in this case, the presumed date of birth cannot be maintained). Paul served as ''[[Lector (liturgy)|lector]]'' of the [[Esztergom Basilica|cathedral chapter]] of [[Esztergom]] from around 1251 to 1255, according to G\u00e1bor V\u00e9kony.{{sfn|V\u00e9kony|1991|p=364}}{{sfn|Thoroczkay|1995|p=160}}\n\nPaul elevated into the position of provost of [[Bratislava|Pressburg]] (present-day Bratislava, Slovakia) by November 1256, when he was first mentioned in this capacity.{{sfn|V\u00e9kony|1991|p=364}} He served as vice-chancellor in the royal court of B\u00e9la IV from 1259 to 1262.{{sfn|Zsoldos|2011|p=111}} Paul was elected provost of [[Sz\u00e9kesfeh\u00e9rv\u00e1r Basilica|Feh\u00e9rv\u00e1r]] by December 1260, responsible for issuing royal diplomas.{{sfn|V\u00e9kony|1991|p=364}} He held both dignities until the summer of 1262, when he was replaced by [[Farkas Bejc]] as provost and vice-chancellor.{{sfn|Zsoldos|2011|p=111}}\n\n==Bishop of Veszpr\u00e9m==\nPaul Balog succeeded [[Zlaudus Kaplon|Zlaudus J\u00e1k]] as Bishop of Veszpr\u00e9m at the turn of 1262 and 1263. He was first styled as bishop by a contemporary document in April 1263. Besides that, he was employed in the retinue of Queen [[Maria Laskarina]], wife of B\u00e9la IV. He served as chancellor of the queenly court from 1263 until Queen Maria's death in 1270 (in documents, he bore the title for the last time in 1269).{{sfn|Zsoldos|2011|pp=101, 115}} He was the first bishop of Veszpr\u00e9m, who held that office; later, the two positions were often filled by the same prelate.{{sfn|Zsoldos|2005|p=24}}\n\nIn 1262 the hermit [[Eusebius of Esztergom]] went to [[Rome]] with his companions to meet [[Pope Urban IV]] to ask him for approval for founding his [[Order of Saint Paul the First Hermit|own order]]. He had the support of [[Thomas Aquinas]] and Cardinal [[Stephen I B\u00e1ncsa]]. The pope first refused to give Eusebius his permission because of financial conditions and asked Paul Balog to examine the monasteries in 1263.{{sfn|Mark\u00f3|2006|p=320}} Following investigations, a new regula was given the congregation by Paul, fundamentally contributing to the formal formation of the monastic order, the Pauline Fathers or more officially, the Order of Saint Paul the First Hermit.{{sfn|Solymosi|1994|p=57}} His role was also preserved by the 15th-century Pauline friar Gergely Gy\u00f6ngy\u00f6si in his manuscript.{{sfn|V\u00e9kony|1991|p=364}} Paul also confirmed the collection right of [[tithe]] to the nuns of Veszpr\u00e9m Valley, granted by one of his predecessors, [[Robert, Archbishop of Esztergom|Robert]] in 1210.{{sfn|Solymosi|1994|p=57}} King B\u00e9la IV restored the previously confiscated revenues and usurped privileges to the Diocese of Veszpr\u00e9m in 1269.{{sfn|Mark\u00f3|2006|p=320}} The monarch also confirmed the bishop of Veszpr\u00e9m's right of crowning the [[List of Hungarian consorts|queen consort of Hungary]], which they claimed many times being an established tradition since 1216).{{sfn|Zsoldos|2005|pp=18, 22\u201323}}\n\nDespite that Paul was a faithful supporter of King B\u00e9la IV and Queen Maria in the 1260s (he was referred to as a member of the royal council in 1267), which period was characterized by civil war conditions with their eldest son and heir [[Stephen V of Hungary|Duke Stephen]], the bishop was able to retain his influence after the death of B\u00e9la IV and the coronation of Stephen V in May 1270.{{sfn|V\u00e9kony|1991|p=364}} It is possible that Paul performed the coronation and anointment of [[Elizabeth the Cuman]] as queen consort in the same time, but there is no specific source for that.{{sfn|Zsoldos|2005|p=22}} After a short war between Stephen V and his long-time rival, [[Ottokar II of Bohemia]] in the spring of 1271, Paul Balog led a Hungarian delegation to Pressburg, where negotiated with Ottokar's envoy, [[Bruno von Schauenburg]], [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Olomouc|Bishop of Olomouc]]. The [[Peace of Pressburg (1271)|peace treaty]] was signed on 2 July 1271.{{sfn|Mark\u00f3|2006|p=320}}{{sfn|Solymosi|1994|p=55}}\n\nAfter the death of Stephen V, Paul Balog was made chancellor in the royal court of the minor [[Ladislaus IV of Hungary|Ladislaus IV]]. He first appeared in this capacity on 15 November 1272. He was deprived from his office and was replaced by [[Philip T\u00fcrje]] some days after 9 December. However, the elderly archbishop died on 18 December, and Paul regained the position by January 1273. He was again dismissed as chancellor two months later, when [[Nicholas K\u00e1n]] appeared in this capacity. For the third time, Paul was reinstated as chancellor around June 1273 and now, he was able to retain the dignity until his death.{{sfn|Zsoldos|2011|p=109}} These rapid changes also well presented the chaotic years during the minority of Ladislaus IV, when various baronial factions fought for the supreme power.{{sfn|V\u00e9kony|1991|p=364}} Paul performed the coronation of Ladislaus' spouse [[Elizabeth of Sicily, Queen of Hungary|Isabella of Sicily]] as queen consort sometime between 11 and 16 July 1273, according to her reminiscence from 1280.{{sfn|Zsoldos|2005|p=21}} Paul Balog was last mentioned as a living person on 2 January 1275. He died by March, when the position of Bishop of Veszpr\u00e9m was in a vacancy. He was succeeded by [[Peter K\u0151szegi]] around May 1275.{{sfn|Zsoldos|2011|p=101}}\n\n==Identification theory==\nAccording to the 18th-century historian and librarian [[Gy\u00f6rgy Pray]] (''Dissertationes histori- co-criticae in Annales veteres Hunnorum, Avarum et Hungarorum'', 1774), Paul Balog was identical with the chronicler [[Anonymus (notary of B\u00e9la III)|Anonymus]] (or Master P.), author of the ''[[Gesta Hungarorum]]''.{{sfn|Thoroczkay|1995|p=159}} Archaeologist G\u00e1bor V\u00e9kony shared this viewpoint. Consequently, V\u00e9kony claimed the work was completed in the second half of the 13th century, unlike the majority of modern scholars, who argued Anonymus was a notary of [[B\u00e9la III of Hungary]] (r. 1172\u20131196).{{sfn|V\u00e9kony|1991|p=365}} The chronicler dedicated his work to a former schoolmate \"the most venerable man N\", this address implies Anonymus had to be a prelate.{{sfn|Thoroczkay|1995|p=159}} V\u00e9kony argued Anonymus (Paul) deliberately wrote his \"apocryphal ''gesta''\" as if he were a contemporary of [[B\u00e9la I of Hungary]] (r. 1060\u20131063). The author knew [[Veszpr\u00e9m]], [[Kom\u00e1rom]] and the surrounding area well, where from Paul and his family originated.{{sfn|Thoroczkay|1995|p=160}} During his tenure as its chancellor, Queen's Chancellery issued a charter for Paul's brother Benedict in 1265, in which the term is included \"''de genere Turda''\", referring to the [[Tardos (genus)|''gens'' Tardos]] (or Tordos), which owned lands in the same area. Beside that, the name \"Turda\" appears exclusively in the ''Gesta Hungarorum''.{{sfn|V\u00e9kony|1991|p=365}} V\u00e9kony argued the phraseological similarity (place names, geographical names) between the ''Gesta Hungarorum'' and the establishing charter of the abbey of Sz\u00e1zd proves that Paul Balog was present, when B\u00e9la IV transcribed the latter in 1267. The historian added, similarities between the work and B\u00e9la's \"Tartar letter\" (c. 1248) also proves that Paul belonged to the close retinue of the Hungarian monarch by that time.{{sfn|Thoroczkay|1995|p=161}} V\u00e9kony found phraseological identities also between the ''gesta'' and his ''regula'' provided for the Pauline friars in 1263.{{sfn|V\u00e9kony|1991|pp=367\u2013368}}\n\n[[File:Gesta Hungarorum Anonymous.jpg|thumb|left|200px|First page of the ''[[Gesta Hungarorum]]'']]\n\nBased on his hypothesis, V\u00e9kony considered that Paul Balog attended a foreign ''universitas'' sometime between 1237 and 1248.{{sfn|V\u00e9kony|1991|p=369}} Anonymus had a detailed knowledge of literacy works, for instance, he had found pleasure in reading the ''Trojan History'', a work attributed to [[Dares Phrygius]]. During Paul's tenure (perhaps he himself was responsible for its establishment), there was an illustrious cathedral chapter school in Veszpr\u00e9m (but not ''universitas'', as V\u00e9kony incorrectly claimed), containing a sizable library and archives. However, [[Palatine of Hungary|Palatine]] [[Peter I Cs\u00e1k|Peter Cs\u00e1k]]'s troops (as enemy of the [[K\u0151szegi family|K\u0151szegi]]s, thus also Peter K\u0151szegi, during the 1270s civil war) devastated and pillaged the whole Diocese of Veszpr\u00e9m in 1276, the school was never rebuilt. According to the account of the late Paul Balog's namesake nephew, then a canon at Veszpr\u00e9m, his own damages amounted to around 4,000 marks, including the loss of his books (1000 marks), which he \"inherited from his progenitors\". V\u00e9kony argued these manuscripts and chronicles were initially part of the elder Paul's collection, who used these works for writing the ''Gesta Hungarorum''.{{sfn|Thoroczkay|1995|p=161}} V\u00e9kony claimed Paul Balog (Anonymus) knew and despised the ''gesta'' of his contemporary [[\u00c1kos (chronicler)|\u00c1kos]]. Also a former chancellor in the queenly court, they had personal conflicts each other, in addition to various lawsuits between the Diocese of Veszpr\u00e9m and the Provostry of [[\u00d3buda]] (where \u00c1kos was provost) over numerous possessions. Thus, Paul Balog had to wrote his ''Gesta Hungarorum'' after \u00c1kos' work, most presumably in 1273, when he was replaced as royal chancellor by Nicholas K\u00e1n for a relatively longer time. Paul's confrontation with his successor (who belonged to the rival baronial group in that time) contributed to that the author of ''Gesta Hungarorum'' indicated the ''gens'' [[K\u00e1n]] of \"unknown origin\" (while ''magister'' \u00c1kos derived them from the lineage of ''[[Gyula (title)|gyulas]]''). While Paul was a partisan of the [[Cs\u00e1k (genus)|''gens'' Cs\u00e1k]] during the 1270s feudal anarchy, \u00c1kos stood with their rival, the K\u0151szegi family (he possibly intentionally placed their arrival to the age of Grand Prince [[G\u00e9za, Grand Prince of the Hungarians|G\u00e9za]] [r. 972\u2013997], emphasizing its ancient origin, while in fact, they only came to Hungary in the 1140s). In addition to \u00c1kos, V\u00e9kony claimed that [[Simon of K\u00e9za]], author of the ''[[Gesta Hunnorum et Hungarorum]]'' knew and used Anonymus' work (against the mainstream position). To substantiate the claim, V\u00e9kony argued Simon attended the chapter school of Veszpr\u00e9m between 1273 and 1276 (where read the ''Gesta Hungarorum''), before moving to a foreign ''universitas''. After the devastation of Veszpr\u00e9m in 1276, Anonymus' ''gesta'' somehow went abroad and disappeared for centuries.{{sfn|V\u00e9kony|1991|pp=370\u2013372}}{{sfn|Thoroczkay|1995|p=162}}\n\nSeveral historians, including [[Gyula Krist\u00f3]], L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Veszpr\u00e9my and G\u00e1bor Thoroczkay did not accept G\u00e1bor V\u00e9kony's theory, also refusing the ''Gesta Hungarorum'''s assumed time of compilation to the time of King B\u00e9la IV.{{sfn|Thoroczkay|1995|p=158}} In addition, Thoroczkay argued V\u00e9kony did not take into account a number of facts which would have contradicted his theory (for instance, that Anonymus had a detailed knowledge of the lands along the upper courses of the river [[Tisza]], in the opposite part of the kingdom from that region, where Paul Balog lived and operated). His text comparisons are arbitrarily selected examples to match the identification of Paul with the chronicler, and there are also phraseological similarities with other documents, which Paul had nothing to do with, as Thoroczkay added.{{sfn|Thoroczkay|1995|p=162}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|20em}}\n\n== Sources ==\n{{Refbegin}}\n* {{cite book |last=Mark\u00f3 |first=L\u00e1szl\u00f3 |year=2006 |title=A magyar \u00e1llam f\u0151m\u00e9lt\u00f3s\u00e1gai Szent Istv\u00e1nt\u00f3l napjainkig: \u00c9letrajzi Lexikon ''[Great Officers of State in Hungary from King Saint Stephen to Our Days: A Biographical Encyclopedia]'' |publisher=Helikon Kiad\u00f3 |isbn=963-208-970-7 |ref=harv|language=hu}}\n* {{cite book |last=Solymosi |first=L\u00e1szl\u00f3 |editor-last=V.

He had two brothers, including Benedict, who served as ''[[isp\u00e1n]]'' of [[Veszpr\u00e9m County (former)|Veszpr\u00e9m County]] in 1269.{{sfn|Zsoldos|2011|p=227}} He was called Benedict of \u00c1rma in 1266, after his ownership of a village in [[Bars County]] (present-day an uninhabited waste in [[M\u00e1la\u0161]], [[Slovakia]]). Paul's another, unidentified brother was the father of his [[Paul Balog, Bishop of P\u00e9cs|namesake nephew]], who was elevated into the dignity of [[Bishop of P\u00e9cs]] at the turn of the 13th and 14th centuries. Benedict had two sons, Michael and Paul.{{sfn|Zsoldos|2011|pp=341\u2013342}}\n\nSeveral historians consider that Paul and his family belonged to the Sz\u00e9csi branch of the [[Balog (genus)|''gens'' (clan) Balog]],{{sfn|Mark\u00f3|2006|p=320}} based on the 15th-century [[Order of Saint Paul the First Hermit|Pauline friar]] Gergely Gy\u00f6ngy\u00f6si's ''Vitae fratrum Eremitarum Ordinis Sancti Pauli Primi Eremitae'',{{sfn|V\u00e9kony|1991|p=365}} but it is not without doubt. Historian Gyula Pauler claimed Paul originated from the [[T\u00e9t\u00e9ny (genus)|clan T\u00e9t\u00e9ny]], but his contemporary, genealogist J\u00e1nos Kar\u00e1csonyi, refused this. [[Gy\u00f6rgy Gy\u00f6rffy]] argued the \"\u00c1rma branch\" of the ''gens'' [[Hont-P\u00e1zm\u00e1ny]] consisted of Paul and his brothers, but [[P\u00e1l Engel]] did not connect them to the widely extended kindred in his genealogical work.{{sfn|Zsoldos|2011|pp=341\u2013342}} Archaeologist [[G\u00e1bor V\u00e9kony]] assumed Paul might be a member of the [[Szal\u00f3k (genus)|''gens'' Szal\u00f3k]].{{sfn|V\u00e9kony|1991|p=375}} Nevertheless, the majority of historians accepted that both prelates with the name Paul came from the Balog kindred.{{sfn|Mark\u00f3|2006|p=320}}\n\n==Early career==\nAccording to historian Istv\u00e1n Hajnal, Paul was identical with that namesake clergyman, who was referred to as royal chaplain and papal vicar in the court of [[B\u00e9la IV of Hungary]] in 1245. However, that document later proved to be a forgery. It is also possible he is identical with that royal chaplain Paul, who was entrusted by the king to arrange in the possession matters of the [[Hah\u00f3t (genus)|''gens'' Hah\u00f3t]] in [[Zala County (former)|Zala County]], assisting the work of ''isp\u00e1n'' [[Arnold II Hah\u00f3t|Arnold Hah\u00f3t]] in 1237 (of course, in this case, the presumed date of birth cannot be maintained). Paul served as ''[[Lector (liturgy)|lector]]'' of the [[Esztergom Basilica|cathedral chapter]] of [[Esztergom]] from around 1251 to 1255, according to G\u00e1bor V\u00e9kony.{{sfn|V\u00e9kony|1991|p=364}}{{sfn|Thoroczkay|1995|p=160}}\n\nPaul elevated into the position of provost of [[Bratislava|Pressburg]] (present-day Bratislava, Slovakia) by November 1256, when he was first mentioned in this capacity.{{sfn|V\u00e9kony|1991|p=364}} He served as vice-chancellor in the royal court of B\u00e9la IV from 1259 to 1262.{{sfn|Zsoldos|2011|p=111}} Paul was elected provost of [[Sz\u00e9kesfeh\u00e9rv\u00e1r Basilica|Feh\u00e9rv\u00e1r]] by December 1260, responsible for issuing royal diplomas.{{sfn|V\u00e9kony|1991|p=364}} He held both dignities until the summer of 1262, when he was replaced by [[Farkas Bejc]] as provost and vice-chancellor.{{sfn|Zsoldos|2011|p=111}}\n\n==Bishop of Veszpr\u00e9m==\nPaul Balog succeeded [[Zlaudus Kaplon|Zlaudus J\u00e1k]] as Bishop of Veszpr\u00e9m at the turn of 1262 and 1263. He was first styled as bishop by a contemporary document in April 1263. Beside that, he was employed in the retinue of Queen [[Maria Laskarina]], wife of B\u00e9la IV. He served as chancellor of the queenly court from 1263 until Queen Maria's death in 1270 (in documents, he bore the title for the last time in 1269).{{sfn|Zsoldos|2011|pp=101, 115}} He was the first bishop of Veszpr\u00e9m, who held that office; later, the two positions were often filled by the same prelate.{{sfn|Zsoldos|2005|p=24}}\n\nIn 1262 the hermit [[Eusebius of Esztergom]] went to [[Rome]] with his companions to meet [[Pope Urban IV]] to ask him for approval for founding his [[Order of Saint Paul the First Hermit|own order]]. He had the support of [[Thomas Aquinas]] and Cardinal [[Stephen I B\u00e1ncsa]]. The pope first refused to give Eusebius his permission because of financial conditions and asked Paul Balog to examine the monasteries in 1263.{{sfn|Mark\u00f3|2006|p=320}} Following investigations, a new regula was given the congregation by Paul, fundamentally contributing to the formal formation of the monastic order, the Pauline Fathers or more officially, the Order of Saint Paul the First Hermit.{{sfn|Solymosi|1994|p=57}} His role was also preserved by the 15th-century Pauline friar Gergely Gy\u00f6ngy\u00f6si in his manuscript.{{sfn|V\u00e9kony|1991|p=364}} Paul also confirmed the collection right of [[tithe]] to the nuns of Veszpr\u00e9m Valley, granted by one of his predecessors, [[Robert, Archbishop of Esztergom|Robert]] in 1210.{{sfn|Solymosi|1994|p=57}} King B\u00e9la IV restored the previously confiscated revenues and usurped privileges to the Diocese of Veszpr\u00e9m in 1269.{{sfn|Mark\u00f3|2006|p=320}} The monarch also confirmed the bishop of Veszpr\u00e9m's right of crowning the [[List of Hungarian consorts|queen consort of Hungary]], which they claimed many times being an established tradition since 1216).{{sfn|Zsoldos|2005|pp=18, 22\u201323}}\n\nDespite that Paul was a faithful supporter of King B\u00e9la IV and Queen Maria in the 1260s (he was referred to as a member of the royal council in 1267), which period was characterized by civil war conditions with their eldest son and heir [[Stephen V of Hungary|Duke Stephen]], the bishop was able to retain his influence after the death of B\u00e9la IV and the coronation of Stephen V in May 1270.{{sfn|V\u00e9kony|1991|p=364}} It is possible that Paul performed the coronation and anointment of [[Elizabeth the Cuman]] as queen consort in the same time, but there is no specific source for that.{{sfn|Zsoldos|2005|p=22}} After a short war between Stephen V and his long-time rival, [[Ottokar II of Bohemia]] in the spring of 1271, Paul Balog led a Hungarian delegation to Pressburg, where negotiated with Ottokar's envoy, [[Bruno von Schauenburg]], [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Olomouc|Bishop of Olomouc]]. The [[Peace of Pressburg (1271)|peace treaty]] was signed on 2 July 1271.{{sfn|Mark\u00f3|2006|p=320}}{{sfn|Solymosi|1994|p=55}}\n\nAfter the death of Stephen V, Paul Balog was made chancellor in the royal court of the minor [[Ladislaus IV of Hungary|Ladislaus IV]]. He first appeared in this capacity on 15 November 1272. He was deprived from his office and was replaced by [[Philip T\u00fcrje]] some days after 9 December. However, the elderly archbishop died on 18 December, and Paul regained the position by January 1273. He was again dismissed as chancellor two months later, when [[Nicholas K\u00e1n]] appeared in this capacity. For the third time, Paul was reinstated as chancellor around June 1273 and now, he was able to retain the dignity until his death.{{sfn|Zsoldos|2011|p=109}} These rapid changes also well presented the chaotic years during the minority of Ladislaus IV, when various baronial factions fought for the supreme power.{{sfn|V\u00e9kony|1991|p=364}} Paul performed the coronation of Ladislaus' spouse [[Elizabeth of Sicily, Queen of Hungary|Isabella of Sicily]] as queen consort sometime between 11 and 16 July 1273, according to her reminiscence from 1280.{{sfn|Zsoldos|2005|p=21}} Paul Balog was last mentioned as a living person on 2 January 1275. He died by March, when the position of Bishop of Veszpr\u00e9m was in a vacancy. He was succeeded by [[Peter K\u0151szegi]] around May 1275.{{sfn|Zsoldos|2011|p=101}}\n\n==Identification theory==\nAccording to the 18th-century historian and librarian [[Gy\u00f6rgy Pray]] (''Dissertationes histori- co-criticae in Annales veteres Hunnorum, Avarum et Hungarorum'', 1774), Paul Balog was identical with the chronicler [[Anonymus (notary of B\u00e9la III)|Anonymus]] (or Master P.), author of the ''[[Gesta Hungarorum]]''.{{sfn|Thoroczkay|1995|p=159}} Archaeologist G\u00e1bor V\u00e9kony shared this viewpoint. Consequently, V\u00e9kony claimed the work was completed in the second half of the 13th century, unlike the majority of modern scholars, who argued Anonymus was a notary of [[B\u00e9la III of Hungary]] (r. 1172\u20131196).{{sfn|V\u00e9kony|1991|p=365}} The chronicler dedicated his work to a former schoolmate \"the most venerable man N\", this address implies Anonymus had to be a prelate.{{sfn|Thoroczkay|1995|p=159}} V\u00e9kony argued Anonymus (Paul) deliberately wrote his \"apocryphal ''gesta''\" as if he were a contemporary of [[B\u00e9la I of Hungary]] (r. 1060\u20131063). The author knew [[Veszpr\u00e9m]], [[Kom\u00e1rom]] and the surrounding area well, where from Paul and his family originated.{{sfn|Thoroczkay|1995|p=160}} During his tenure as its chancellor, Queen's Chancellery issued a charter for Paul's brother Benedict in 1265, in which the term is included \"''de genere Turda''\", referring to the [[Tardos (genus)|''gens'' Tardos]] (or Tordos), which owned lands in the same area. Beside that, the name \"Turda\" appears exclusively in the ''Gesta Hungarorum''.{{sfn|V\u00e9kony|1991|p=365}} V\u00e9kony argued the phraseological similarity (place names, geographical names) between the ''Gesta Hungarorum'' and the establishing charter of the abbey of Sz\u00e1zd proves that Paul Balog was present, when B\u00e9la IV transcribed the latter in 1267. The historian added, similarities between the work and B\u00e9la's \"Tartar letter\" (c. 1248) also proves that Paul belonged to the close retinue of the Hungarian monarch by that time.{{sfn|Thoroczkay|1995|p=161}} V\u00e9kony found phraseological identities also between the ''gesta'' and his ''regula'' provided for the Pauline friars in 1263.{{sfn|V\u00e9kony|1991|pp=367\u2013368}}\n\n[[File:Gesta Hungarorum Anonymous.jpg|thumb|left|200px|First page of the ''[[Gesta Hungarorum]]'']]\n\nBased on his hypothesis, V\u00e9kony considered that Paul Balog attended a foreign ''universitas'' sometime between 1237 and 1248.{{sfn|V\u00e9kony|1991|p=369}} Anonymus had a detailed knowledge of literacy works, for instance, he had found pleasure in reading the ''Trojan History'', a work attributed to [[Dares Phrygius]]. During Paul's tenure (perhaps he himself was responsible for its establishment), there was an illustrious cathedral chapter school in Veszpr\u00e9m (but not ''universitas'', as V\u00e9kony incorrectly claimed), containing a sizable library and archives. However, [[Palatine of Hungary|Palatine]] [[Peter I Cs\u00e1k|Peter Cs\u00e1k]]'s troops (as enemy of the [[K\u0151szegi family|K\u0151szegi]]s, thus also Peter K\u0151szegi, during the 1270s civil war) devastated and pillaged the whole Diocese of Veszpr\u00e9m in 1276, the school was never rebuilt. According to the account of the late Paul Balog's namesake nephew, then a canon at Veszpr\u00e9m, his own damages amounted to around 4,000 marks, including the loss of his books (1000 marks), which he \"inherited from his progenitors\". V\u00e9kony argued these manuscripts and chronicles were initially part of the elder Paul's collection, who used these works for writing the ''Gesta Hungarorum''.{{sfn|Thoroczkay|1995|p=161}} V\u00e9kony claimed Paul Balog (Anonymus) knew and despised the ''gesta'' of his contemporary [[\u00c1kos (chronicler)|\u00c1kos]]. Also a former chancellor in the queenly court, they had personal conflicts each other, in addition to various lawsuits between the Diocese of Veszpr\u00e9m and the Provostry of [[\u00d3buda]] (where \u00c1kos was provost) over numerous possessions. Thus, Paul Balog had to wrote his ''Gesta Hungarorum'' after \u00c1kos' work, most presumably in 1273, when he was replaced as royal chancellor by Nicholas K\u00e1n for a relatively longer time. Paul's confrontation with his successor (who belonged to the rival baronial group in that time) contributed to that the author of ''Gesta Hungarorum'' indicated the ''gens'' [[K\u00e1n]] of \"unknown origin\" (while ''magister'' \u00c1kos derived them from the lineage of ''[[Gyula (title)|gyulas]]''). While Paul was a partisan of the [[Cs\u00e1k (genus)|''gens'' Cs\u00e1k]] during the 1270s feudal anarchy, \u00c1kos stood with their rival, the K\u0151szegi family (he possibly intentionally placed their arrival to the age of Grand Prince [[G\u00e9za, Grand Prince of the Hungarians|G\u00e9za]] [r. 972\u2013997], emphasizing its ancient origin, while in fact, they only came to Hungary in the 1140s). In addition to \u00c1kos, V\u00e9kony claimed that [[Simon of K\u00e9za]], author of the ''[[Gesta Hunnorum et Hungarorum]]'' knew and used Anonymus' work (against the mainstream position). To substantiate the claim, V\u00e9kony argued Simon attended the chapter school of Veszpr\u00e9m between 1273 and 1276 (where read the ''Gesta Hungarorum''), before moving to a foreign ''universitas''. After the devastation of Veszpr\u00e9m in 1276, Anonymus' ''gesta'' somehow went abroad and disappeared for centuries.{{sfn|V\u00e9kony|1991|pp=370\u2013372}}{{sfn|Thoroczkay|1995|p=162}}\n\nSeveral historians, including [[Gyula Krist\u00f3]], L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Veszpr\u00e9my and G\u00e1bor Thoroczkay did not accept G\u00e1bor V\u00e9kony's theory, also refusing the ''Gesta Hungarorum'''s assumed time of compilation to the time of King B\u00e9la IV.{{sfn|Thoroczkay|1995|p=158}} In addition, Thoroczkay argued V\u00e9kony did not take into account a number of facts which would have contradicted his theory (for instance, that Anonymus had a detailed knowledge of the lands along the upper courses of the river [[Tisza]], in the opposite part of the kingdom from that region, where Paul Balog lived and operated). His text comparisons are arbitrarily selected examples to match the identification of Paul with the chronicler, and there are also phraseological similarities with other documents, which Paul had nothing to do with, as Thoroczkay added.{{sfn|Thoroczkay|1995|p=162}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|20em}}\n\n== Sources ==\n{{Refbegin}}\n* {{cite book |last=Mark\u00f3 |first=L\u00e1szl\u00f3 |year=2006 |title=A magyar \u00e1llam f\u0151m\u00e9lt\u00f3s\u00e1gai Szent Istv\u00e1nt\u00f3l napjainkig: \u00c9letrajzi Lexikon ''[Great Officers of State in Hungary from King Saint Stephen to Our Days: A Biographical Encyclopedia]'' |publisher=Helikon Kiad\u00f3 |isbn=963-208-970-7 |ref=harv|language=hu}}\n* {{cite book |last=Solymosi |first=L\u00e1szl\u00f3 |editor-last=V.

The challenge does not take place on specially-made courses, but rather it is incorporated into pre-existing, traditional races.<ref>[http://www.wmra.ch/files/regulations/microsoft_word_-_wmra_world_long_distance__tomo_.pdf WMRA World Long Distance Mountain Running Challenge Regulations].

Personal quarantine is overseen by the local health agencies. By doing so, authorities are trying to keep infection chains short, leading to curtailed clusters. In the ''protection stage'' the strategy will change to using direct measures to protect vulnerable persons from becoming infected. The ''mitigation stage'' will eventually try to avoid spikes of intensive treatment in order to maintain medical services.\n\n===Criticism===\nAs early as January 2013, the German [[Bundestag]] was fully informed about the dangers of the global spread of a coronavirus pandemic. A risk analysis predicted how dangerous a global coronavirus outbreak could be. It stated that \"children [\u2026] have [\u2026] minor disease progressions\" and that the risk of death of \"over-65-year-olds [is] at 50%\". It furthermore stated that a \"vaccine\" is \"unavailable\", so all the more important is the \"use of protective equipment such as protective masks, goggles and gloves\". The {{ill|Federal Office of Civil Protection and Disaster Assistance|de|Bundesamt f\u00fcr Bev\u00f6lkerungsschutz und Katastrophenhilfe}} (BBK) never set up appropriate stores or had talks with manufacturers and suppliers to prepare for such a situation.<ref name=\"frontal\">{{Cite news |title=Vers\u00e4umte Pandemie-Vorsorge |date=24 March 2020 |work=ZDF Frontal 21 |language=de |author-first1=Andreas |author-last1=Halbach |author-first2=Thomas |author-last2=M\u00fcnten |author-first3=Heiko |author-last3=Rahms}}</ref>\n\n==Statistics==\n=== Robert Koch Institute ===\nThe [[Robert Koch Institute]] (RKI) lists current numbers of registered cases in Germany and other countries online.

Starting 10 March 2020, due to continuously rising case numbers, RKI stopped manually updating the numbers and switched to adopting the numbers that were electronically transmitted.

Personal quarantine is overseen by the local health agencies. By doing so, authorities are trying to keep infection chains short, leading to curtailed clusters. In the ''protection stage'' the strategy will change to using direct measures to protect vulnerable persons from becoming infected. The ''mitigation stage'' will eventually try to avoid spikes of intensive treatment in order to maintain medical services.\n\n===Criticism===\nAs early as January 2013, the German [[Bundestag]] was fully informed about the dangers of the global spread of a coronavirus pandemic. A risk analysis predicted how dangerous a global coronavirus outbreak could be. It stated that \"children [\u2026] have [\u2026] minor disease progressions\" and that the risk of death of \"over-65-year-olds [is] at 50%\". It furthermore stated that a \"vaccine\" is \"unavailable\", so all the more important is the \"use of protective equipment such as protective masks, goggles and gloves\". The {{ill|Federal Office of Civil Protection and Disaster Assistance|de|Bundesamt f\u00fcr Bev\u00f6lkerungsschutz und Katastrophenhilfe}} (BBK) never set up appropriate stores or had talks with manufacturers and suppliers to prepare for such a situation.<ref name=\"frontal\">{{Cite news |title=Vers\u00e4umte Pandemie-Vorsorge |date=24 March 2020 |work=ZDF Frontal 21 |language=de |author-first1=Andreas |author-last1=Halbach |author-first2=Thomas |author-last2=M\u00fcnten |author-first3=Heiko |author-last3=Rahms}}</ref>\n\n==Statistics==\n=== Robert Koch Institute ===\nThe [[Robert Koch Institute]] (RKI) lists current numbers of registered cases in Germany and other countries online.

Starting 10 March 2020, due to continuously rising case numbers, RKI stopped manually updating the numbers and switched to adopting the numbers that were electronically transmitted.

Writers Chris Yost and Eric Pearson tried to follow the logic of the films' timeline when plotting the comic, and received \"the seal of approval\" from Feige and Marvel Studios on the final timeline.<ref name=\"WritingBigWeek\" /> As promotion for ''The Avengers'', Marvel released an official [[infographic]] detailing this timeline in May 2012.<ref name=\"TimelineInfographic\" />\n\nWanting to simplify the in-universe timeline,<ref name=\"Phase1Timeline\" /> the Phase Two films were set roughly in real time relating to ''The Avengers'': ''Iron Man 3'' takes place about six months later, during Christmas;<ref name=\"IM3TimeFrame\" /><ref name=\"CapTWSSynopsis1\" /> ''Thor: The Dark World'' is set one year later;<ref name=\"ThorTDWSynopsis1\" /> and ''Captain America: The Winter Soldier'' is two years after.<ref name=\"CapTWSSynopsis1\" /> ''Avengers: Age of Ultron'' and ''Ant-Man'' ended the phase in 2015,<ref name=\"THRAvengers2ReleaseDate\" /><ref name=\"AntManReleaseDate\" /> with several months passing between those films in-universe as in real life.<ref name=\"/Film65Things1\"/> For Phase Three, directors the Russo brothers wanted to continue using real time, and so ''Captain America: Civil War'' begins a year after ''Age of Ultron'',<ref name=\"CapCWTimeline\" /> with ''Avengers: Infinity War'' set two years after that.<ref name=\"CWIWTimeline\" /> However, producer Brad Winderbaum said the Phase Three films would actually \"happen on top of each other\" while being less \"interlocked\" as the Phase One films were,<ref name=\"ColliderSept2017\" /> with ''Black Panther'' and ''Spider-Man: Homecoming'' respectively beginning a week and several months after ''Civil War'';<ref name=\"BPProductionBegins\" /><ref name=\"SMHTimeline\" /> ''Thor: Ragnarok'' beginning four years after ''The Dark World'' and two years after ''Age of Ultron'',<ref name=\"Oct2014EventMarvel\" /><ref name=\"RagnarokSDCC\" /> around the same time as ''Civil War'' and ''Homecoming'';<ref name=\"ColliderSept2017\" /> ''Doctor Strange'' taking place over a whole year and ending \"up to date with the rest of the MCU\";<ref name=\"DoctorStrangeEE\" /> ''Ant-Man and the Wasp'' also set two years after ''Civil War'' and shortly before ''Infinity War'';<ref name=\"AMWTimeline\" /> and both ''Guardians of the Galaxy'' and its sequel ''Vol. 2'' being explicitly set in 2014,<ref name=\"GotGTimeline\" /><ref name=\"GotG2Timeline2\" /> which Feige believed would create a four-year gap between ''Vol. 2'' and ''Infinity War'', though the other MCU films up to that point do not specify years onscreen.<ref name=\"GuardiansIWFourYears\" />\n\nWhen ''Spider-Man: Homecoming'' was being developed, director and co-writer Jon Watts was shown a scroll detailing the MCU timeline that was created by co-producer Eric Carroll when he first began working for Marvel Studios. Watts said the scroll included both where the continuity of the films lined-up and did not lineup, and when fully unfurled it extended beyond the length of a long conference table. This scroll was used as the basis to weave the continuity of ''Homecoming'' into the previous films, such as ''The Avengers''.<ref name=\"TimelineScroll\" /> This was labeled in the film with a title card stating that eight years pass between the end of ''The Avengers'' and the events of ''Civil War'', which was widely criticized as a continuity error that broke the established MCU timeline, in which only four years should have passed.<ref name=\"SMHTimeline2\" /><ref name=\"FeigeTimelinePlans\" /> Additionally, dialogue in ''Civil War'' indicates that eight years pass between the end of ''Iron Man'' and the events of that film, despite the established continuity being closer to five or six years.<ref name=\"VisionMistake\" /><ref name=\"IWRetcon\" /> ''Infinity War'' co-director Joe Russo described the ''Homecoming'' eight years time jump as \"very incorrect\",<ref name=\"RussoSMHIncorrect\" /> and the mistake was ignored in ''Infinity War'' which specified that its events were taking place only six years after ''The Avengers''.<ref name=\"IWRetcon\" /> The public response to the ''Homecoming'' mistake inspired Marvel Studios to release a new timeline for all three phases,<ref name=\"FeigeTimelinePlans\" /> and in November 2018, a timeline, specifying dates for the events in each film released to that point, was included as part of the sourcebook ''Marvel Studios: The First 10 Years'', celebrating the 10-year anniversary of the MCU.<ref name=\"10YearTimeline\" />\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; width:65%; border: none;\"\n|+ ''Marvel Studios: The First 10 Years'' timeline from November 2018<ref name=\"10YearTimeline\" />\n! scope=\"col\" align=\"center\"| Year(s)\n! scope=\"col\" align=\"center\"| Feature films\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 1943\u20131945\n| ''Captain America: The First Avenger''\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 2010\n| ''Iron Man''\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 2011\n| ''Iron Man 2'', ''Thor''\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 2012\n| ''The Avengers'', ''Iron Man 3''\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 2013\n| ''Thor: The Dark World''\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 2014\n| ''Captain America: The Winter Soldier'', ''Guardians of the Galaxy'', ''Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2''\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 2015\n| ''Avengers: Age of Ultron'', ''Ant-Man''\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 2016\n| ''Captain America: Civil War''\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 2016\u20132017\n| ''Doctor Strange''\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 2017\n| ''Black Panther'', ''Thor: Ragnarok'', ''Avengers: Infinity War''\n|-\n| colspan=\"2\" | '''Notes:''' ''The Incredible Hulk'', ''Spider-Man: Homecoming'', and ''Ant-Man and the Wasp'' are discussed in the ''Marvel Studios: The First 10 Years'' sourcebook, but their events are not included in the timeline.<ref name=\"10YearTimeline\" />\n|}\n\nThis timeline ignores the two \"eight-year\" continuity errors, but also contradicts the events of ''Black Panther'' and ''Infinity War'' by placing them in 2017.

Writers Chris Yost and Eric Pearson tried to follow the logic of the films' timeline when plotting the comic, and received \"the seal of approval\" from Feige and Marvel Studios on the final timeline.<ref name=\"WritingBigWeek\" /> As promotion for ''The Avengers'', Marvel released an official [[infographic]] detailing this timeline in May 2012.<ref name=\"TimelineInfographic\" />\n\nWanting to simplify the in-universe timeline,<ref name=\"Phase1Timeline\" /> the Phase Two films were set roughly in real time relating to ''The Avengers'': ''Iron Man 3'' takes place about six months later, during Christmas;<ref name=\"IM3TimeFrame\" /><ref name=\"CapTWSSynopsis1\" /> ''Thor: The Dark World'' is set one year later;<ref name=\"ThorTDWSynopsis1\" /> and ''Captain America: The Winter Soldier'' is two years after.<ref name=\"CapTWSSynopsis1\" /> ''Avengers: Age of Ultron'' and ''Ant-Man'' ended the phase in 2015,<ref name=\"THRAvengers2ReleaseDate\" /><ref name=\"AntManReleaseDate\" /> with several months passing between those films in-universe as in real life.<ref name=\"/Film65Things1\"/> For Phase Three, directors the Russo brothers wanted to continue using real time, and so ''Captain America: Civil War'' begins a year after ''Age of Ultron'',<ref name=\"CapCWTimeline\" /> with ''Avengers: Infinity War'' set two years after that.<ref name=\"CWIWTimeline\" /> However, producer Brad Winderbaum said the Phase Three films would actually \"happen on top of each other\" while being less \"interlocked\" as the Phase One films were,<ref name=\"ColliderSept2017\" /> with ''Black Panther'' and ''Spider-Man: Homecoming'' respectively beginning a week and several months after ''Civil War'';<ref name=\"BPProductionBegins\" /><ref name=\"SMHTimeline\" /> ''Thor: Ragnarok'' beginning four years after ''The Dark World'' and two years after ''Age of Ultron'',<ref name=\"Oct2014EventMarvel\" /><ref name=\"RagnarokSDCC\" /> around the same time as ''Civil War'' and ''Homecoming'';<ref name=\"ColliderSept2017\" /> ''Doctor Strange'' taking place over a whole year and ending \"up to date with the rest of the MCU\";<ref name=\"DoctorStrangeEE\" /> ''Ant-Man and the Wasp'' also set two years after ''Civil War'' and shortly before ''Infinity War'';<ref name=\"AMWTimeline\" /> and both ''Guardians of the Galaxy'' and its sequel ''Vol. 2'' being explicitly set in 2014,<ref name=\"GotGTimeline\" /><ref name=\"GotG2Timeline2\" /> which Feige believed would create a four-year gap between ''Vol. 2'' and ''Infinity War'', though the other MCU films up to that point do not specify years onscreen.<ref name=\"GuardiansIWFourYears\" />\n\nWhen ''Spider-Man: Homecoming'' was being developed, director and co-writer Jon Watts was shown a scroll detailing the MCU timeline that was created by co-producer Eric Carroll when he first began working for Marvel Studios. Watts said the scroll included both where the continuity of the films lined-up and did not lineup, and when fully unfurled it extended beyond the length of a long conference table. This scroll was used as the basis to weave the continuity of ''Homecoming'' into the previous films, such as ''The Avengers''.<ref name=\"TimelineScroll\" /> This was labeled in the film with a title card stating that eight years pass between the end of ''The Avengers'' and the events of ''Civil War'', which was widely criticized as a continuity error that broke the established MCU timeline, in which only four years should have passed.<ref name=\"SMHTimeline2\" /><ref name=\"FeigeTimelinePlans\" /> Additionally, dialogue in ''Civil War'' indicates that eight years pass between the end of ''Iron Man'' and the events of that film, despite the established continuity being closer to five or six years.<ref name=\"VisionMistake\" /><ref name=\"IWRetcon\" /> ''Infinity War'' co-director Joe Russo described the ''Homecoming'' eight years time jump as \"very incorrect\",<ref name=\"RussoSMHIncorrect\" /> and the mistake was ignored in ''Infinity War'' which specified that its events were taking place only six years after ''The Avengers''.<ref name=\"IWRetcon\" /> The public response to the ''Homecoming'' mistake inspired Marvel Studios to release a new timeline for all three phases,<ref name=\"FeigeTimelinePlans\" /> and in November 2018, a timeline, specifying dates for the events in each film released to that point, was included as part of the sourcebook ''Marvel Studios: The First 10 Years'', celebrating the 10-year anniversary of the MCU.<ref name=\"10YearTimeline\" />\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; width:65%; border: none;\"\n|+ ''Marvel Studios: The First 10 Years'' timeline from November 2018<ref name=\"10YearTimeline\" />\n! scope=\"col\" align=\"center\"| Year(s)\n! scope=\"col\" align=\"center\"| Feature films\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 1943\u20131945\n| ''Captain America: The First Avenger''\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 2010\n| ''Iron Man''\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 2011\n| ''Iron Man 2'', ''Thor''\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 2012\n| ''The Avengers'', ''Iron Man 3''\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 2013\n| ''Thor: The Dark World''\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 2014\n| ''Captain America: The Winter Soldier'', ''Guardians of the Galaxy'', ''Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2''\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 2015\n| ''Avengers: Age of Ultron'', ''Ant-Man''\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 2016\n| ''Captain America: Civil War''\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 2016\u20132017\n| ''Doctor Strange''\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 2017\n| ''Black Panther'', ''Thor: Ragnarok'', ''Avengers: Infinity War''\n|-\n| colspan=\"2\" | '''Notes:''' ''The Incredible Hulk'', ''Spider-Man: Homecoming'', and ''Ant-Man and the Wasp'' are discussed in the ''Marvel Studios: The First 10 Years'' sourcebook, but their events are not included in the timeline.<ref name=\"10YearTimeline\" />\n|}\n\nThis timeline ignores the two \"eight-year\" continuity errors, but also contradicts the events of ''Black Panther'' and ''Infinity War'' by placing them in 2017.

It is an elongated {{convert|120|km}} long and {{convert|70|km}} wide mountain that rises to a depth of about {{convert|645|m}}, with nine volcanic cones on its summit. It has steeper southern slopes and a gentle northern slope. To its west lies [[Amp\u00e9re Seamount]], and together with several neighbouring seamounts it is one of the Horseshoe Seamounts.\n\nThe seamount was probably formed by the [[Madeira hotspot]] in the [[Miocene]], together with buckling processes in the [[oceanic crust]]. It was initially probably an island. There is evidence of [[submarine landslide]]s and active [[fault (geology)|faults]] which constitute a [[tsunami]] hazard; the [[1755 Lisbon earthquake]] may have occurred north of the seamount.\n\nThe name Coral Patch Seamount refers to the presence of [[cold water coral]]s on the seamount. Their occurrence there was reported first in 1878, five years before  the actual discovery of the seamount. They are only sparse on Coral Patch Seamount, probably due to lack of nutrients. A number of other submarine animals including fish have been observed.\n\n== Research history and name ==\n\nAn expedition by the {{ship|CS|Dacia}} laying a [[Submarine communications cable|deep sea cable]] between the [[Canary Islands]] and [[Cadiz]] discovered the [[seamount]] on October 12, 1883. The name is a reference to [[cold water coral]]s dredged from the seamount; their occurrence was reported in 1878. The seamount was originally named \"Coral Patch shoal\": the term ''seamount'' was not yet in use at that time.{{sfn|Wienberg|Wintersteller|Beuck|Hebbeln|2013|p=3422}}{{sfn|Hoffman|Freiwald|2017|p=61}} It is only poorly explored.<ref name=\"Morato2013\" />\n\n== Geography and geomorphology ==\n[[File:SMT of the NE Atlantic-Ocean.svg|thumb|500px|Seamounts of the north-east [[Atlantic Ocean]]]]\nA number of seamounts exist in the northeastern [[Atlantic]] around the [[Azores]], the [[Canary Islands]] and [[Madeira]].

It is an elongated {{convert|120|km}} long and {{convert|70|km}} wide mountain that rises to a depth of about {{convert|645|m}}, with nine volcanic cones on its summit. It has steeper southern slopes and a gentle northern slope. To its west lies [[Amp\u00e9re Seamount]], and together with several neighbouring seamounts it is one of the Horseshoe Seamounts.\n\nThe seamount was probably formed by the [[Madeira hotspot]] in the [[Miocene]], together with buckling processes in the [[oceanic crust]]. It was initially probably an island. There is evidence of [[submarine landslide]]s and active [[fault (geology)|faults]] which constitute a [[tsunami]] hazard; the [[1755 Lisbon earthquake]] may have occurred north of the seamount.\n\nThe name Coral Patch Seamount refers to the presence of [[cold water coral]]s on the seamount. Their occurrence there was reported first in 1878, five years before  the actual discovery of the seamount. They are only sparse on Coral Patch Seamount, probably due to lack of nutrients. A number of other submarine animals including fish have been observed.\n\n== Research history and name ==\n\nAn expedition by the {{ship|CS|Dacia}} laying a [[Submarine communications cable|deep sea cable]] between the [[Canary Islands]] and [[Cadiz]] discovered the [[seamount]] on October 12, 1883. The name is a reference to [[cold water coral]]s dredged from the seamount; their occurrence was reported in 1878. The seamount was originally named \"Coral Patch shoal\": the term ''seamount'' was not yet in use at that time.{{sfn|Wienberg|Wintersteller|Beuck|Hebbeln|2013|p=3422}}{{sfn|Hoffman|Freiwald|2017|p=61}} It is only poorly explored.<ref name=\"Morato2013\" />\n\n== Geography and geomorphology ==\n[[File:SMT of the NE Atlantic-Ocean.svg|thumb|500px|Seamounts of the north-east [[Atlantic Ocean]]]]\nA number of seamounts exist in the northeastern [[Atlantic]] around the [[Azores]], the [[Canary Islands]] and [[Madeira]]. They rise between [[abyssal plain]]s from a seafloor at {{convert|4000|-|4800|m}} to depths of usually a few hundred meters below sea level.{{sfn|Wienberg|Wintersteller|Beuck|Hebbeln|2013|p=3422}} They are known as the Horseshoe Seamounts.{{sfn|Wienberg|Wintersteller|Beuck|Hebbeln|2013|p=3423}}\n\nTogether with [[Amp\u00e9re Seamount]] farther west Coral Patch Seamount forms the Amp\u00e9re bank:{{sfn|Wienberg|Wintersteller|Beuck|Hebbeln|2013|p=3422}} a {{convert|3400|m}} deep valley separates the two.<ref name=\"Christiansen2014\" /> To the northeast lies Coral Patch Ridge{{sfn|D'Oriano|Angeletti|Capotondi|Laurenzi|2010|p=496}} and north [[Gorringe Ridge]], across the Horseshoe Abyssal Plain.

With specialisations in a) Irish musical and cultural history, b) the music of the Austrian baroque composer Johann Joseph Fux, and c) the development of Anglo-American musicology since 1945, he is one of the most widely published and influential academics in his areas of research. White is also a poet, with two published collections of poetry (2012, 2018).\n\n==Education==\nHarry White was born in [[Dublin]] to Frank White (1926\u20132013) and Sheila, n\u00e9e Danaher (1928\u20131988), the joint eldest (with twin brother, John) of six children. He received his early musical training at the Municipal School of Music, Dublin and at the [[Royal Irish Academy of Music]] (RIAM), where he studied cello with Aisling Drury Byrne. He was a member of the Schola Cantorum at St Finian's College, [[Mullingar]] from 1971 to 1976. He took bachelor's degrees in Music and English at [[University College Dublin]] (UCD) in 1981 and wrote a master's thesis on the plays of [[Harold Pinter]]. He completed an MA in musicology at the [[University of Toronto]] (1984), where he was elected a Junior Fellow of [[Massey College, Toronto|Massey College]] in 1983. Returning to Dublin, he completed his PhD at [[Trinity College Dublin]] in 1986 with a thesis on the oratorios of [[Johann Joseph Fux]],<ref name=\"elliott\">{{cite book |author1=White, Harry |author2=Boydell, Barra  |title=The Encyclopaedia of Music in Ireland |publisher=University College Dublin Press |date=15 September 2013 |location=Dublin |pages= |url=http://www.ucdpress.ie/display.asp?isbn=9781906359782 |isbn=978-1906359782 }}</ref> written under the supervision of [[Hormoz Farhat]].\n\n==Teaching appointments==\nAfter teaching for a year at St Patrick's College, Maynooth (today: [[Maynooth University]]), White was appointed lecturer in music in 1985 at UCD, where he succeeded Anthony Hughes as Professor of Music in 1993. He has held visiting professorships in musicology at the [[University of Western Ontario]] (1996), [[Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich|University of Munich]] (1999), [[King's College, Cambridge]] (2005) and the [[University of Zagreb]] (2006, 2017), and he has given invited lectures and keynote addresses at conferences and symposia across North America and Europe.<ref name=\"elliott\"/>\n\n==Achievements==\nWhite is \"an exceptionally productive scholar, whose work has been transformative.

In 1992, he instituted at UCD the first Irish taught master's degree in musicology.<ref name=\"elliott\"/> In 1994, he was appointed a national advisory editor for the revised, 2001 edition of ''[[The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians#Second edition|The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians]]''; and in 1995 he co-organised (with Patrick Devine) the first major international musicological conference ever to be held in Ireland, at Maynooth.\n\nThe founding of the [[Society for Musicology in Ireland]] (SMI) is largely due to his vision and effort, and he served as its inaugural president from 2003 to 2006. Likewise, the publication of the ''Encyclopaedia of Music in Ireland'' (2 volumes, 2013) would have been unthinkable without White, who has argued for such a publication repeatedly from as early as 1989.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=White |first=Harry |title=The Case for an Encyclopedia of Music in Ireland |journal=The Irish Review |volume=6 |issue=Spring 1989 |pages=39_45 |publisher=Cork University Press |location=Cork |date=1989 |url= |jstor=29735420 |issn= 0790-7850 |doi=10.2307/29735420 |accessdate= }}</ref> He became its joint editor, with Barra Boydell.\n\nIn his many articles on Irish music and in three monographs \u2013 ''The Keeper's Recital'' (1998), ''The Progress of Music in Ireland'' (2005) and ''Music and the Irish Literary Imagination'' (2008) \u2013 he has shed new light on the central role of music in Irish cultural and intellectual life; for the last-named book he was awarded the Michael J. Durkan Prize from the American Conference for Irish Studies (ACIS).<ref>{{cite web |title=Durkan Prize Recipients |work= |publisher=American Conference for Irish Studies |year=2018 |url=https://acisweb.org/durkan-prize-recipients |accessdate=31 March 2020 }}</ref>\n\n==Honours received==\nIn 2006, White became the first historical musicologist to be elected to the [[Royal Irish Academy]] after [[Aloys Fleischmann]] (1966) and [[John Blacking]] (1983). Other honours include Fellowship of the RIAM (2007) and the first DMus awarded by the [[National University of Ireland]] for published work in musicology (2007). He is also an Honorary Fellow of the Academy of St Cecilia (London). In acknowledgement of the publication of the ''Encyclopaedia of Music in Ireland'', both editors received the [[Frank Ll. Harrison|Harrison]] Medal of the Society for Musicology in Ireland in 2014. In 2015, he was elected to the [[Academia Europaea]], and in 2018 he was elected Corresponding Fellow of the [[Croatian Academy of Sciences and Arts]], the first Irish person to receive this honour.\n\nOn the occasion of his sixtieth birthday in 2018, he was honoured with a ''[[festschrift]]'', edited by Lorraine Byrne Bodley with contributions from more than 40 authors that is a testimony to White's wide research interests and his impressive circle of academic friends across the globe.<ref name=\"bodley elliott\"/> David Hiley wrote of it: \"This book is a fine tribute to a remarkable scholar. Not only has Harry White revealed unknown musical riches in Germany and Austria, he has set the music of Ireland in a clearer, truer perspective\".<ref>Quoted from the book jacket.</ref>\n\n==Poetry==\nThe eloquent, expressive and often poetic style of Harry White's musicological writing finds a more artistic outlet in his poetry. As a master's student in Toronto, he had already won the university's gold medal for poetry in 1984. Two published volumes of his poetry have appeared to date: ''Polite Forms'' (2012) and ''The Kenmare Occurrences'' (2018). ''Polite Forms'' has been described as \"a sequence of poems that meditates on family life\" that \"remember and reimagine scenes from childhood and adolescence\"<ref>{{cite web |title=Polite Forms |work= |publisher=Carysfort Press |date=30 March 2012 |url=http://carysfortpress.com/art-and-the-humanities-carysfort-press/polite-forms/ |accessdate=31 March 2020 }}</ref> Of his second collection, a Canadian critic wrote: \"White's strength is to hold both speaker and listener at a distance that is a kind of proximity; the poems acknowledge that memory is flawed, baffling, and all we have to go on.\"<ref>Chantel Lavoie, Professor of English Literature, Royal Military College of Canada, on the reverse cover of the book.</ref>\n\n==Selected writings==\n===Monographs===\n* ''The Keeper's Recital: Music and Cultural History in Ireland, 1770\u20131970'' (Cork: Cork University Press, 1998), {{ISBN|1-85918-171-6}}.\n* ''The Progress of Music in Ireland'' (Dublin: Four Courts Press, 2005), {{ISBN|1-85182-879-6}}.\n* ''Music and the Irish Literary Imagination'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2008), {{ISBN|978-0-19-954732-6}}.\n* ''The Well-tempered Festschrift.

With specialisations in a) Irish musical and cultural history, b) the music of the Austrian baroque composer Johann Joseph Fux, and c) the development of Anglo-American musicology since 1945, he is one of the most widely published and influential academics in his areas of research. White is also a poet, with two published collections of poetry (2012, 2018).\n\n==Education==\nHarry White was born in [[Dublin]] to Frank White (1926\u20132013) and Sheila, n\u00e9e Danaher (1928\u20131988), the joint eldest (with twin brother, John) of six children. He received his early musical training at the Municipal School of Music, Dublin and at the [[Royal Irish Academy of Music]] (RIAM), where he studied cello with Aisling Drury Byrne. He was a member of the Schola Cantorum at St Finian's College, [[Mullingar]] from 1971 to 1976. He took bachelor's degrees in Music and English at [[University College Dublin]] (UCD) in 1981 and wrote a master's thesis on the plays of [[Harold Pinter]]. He completed an MA in musicology at the [[University of Toronto]] (1984), where he was elected a Junior Fellow of [[Massey College, Toronto|Massey College]] in 1983. Returning to Dublin, he completed his PhD at [[Trinity College Dublin]] in 1986 with a thesis on the oratorios of [[Johann Joseph Fux]],<ref name=\"elliott\">{{cite book |author1=White, Harry |author2=Boydell, Barra  |title=The Encyclopaedia of Music in Ireland |publisher=University College Dublin Press |date=15 September 2013 |location=Dublin |pages= |url=http://www.ucdpress.ie/display.asp?isbn=9781906359782 |isbn=978-1906359782 }}</ref> written under the supervision of [[Hormoz Farhat]].\n\n==Teaching appointments==\nAfter teaching for a year at St Patrick's College, Maynooth (today: [[Maynooth University]]), White was appointed lecturer in music in 1985 at UCD, where he succeeded Anthony Hughes as Professor of Music in 1993. He has held visiting professorships in musicology at the [[University of Western Ontario]] (1996), [[Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich|University of Munich]] (1999), [[King's College, Cambridge]] (2005) and the [[University of Zagreb]] (2006, 2017), and he has given invited lectures and keynote addresses at conferences and symposia across North America and Europe.<ref name=\"elliott\"/>\n\n==Achievements==\nWhite is \"an exceptionally productive scholar, whose work has been transformative.

In 1992, he instituted at UCD the first Irish taught master's degree in musicology.<ref name=\"elliott\"/> In 1994, he was appointed a national advisory editor for the revised, 2001 edition of ''[[The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians#Second edition|The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians]]''; and in 1995 he co-organised (with Patrick Devine) the first major international musicological conference ever to be held in Ireland, at Maynooth.\n\nThe founding of the Society for Musicology in Ireland (SMI) is largely due to his vision and effort, and he served as its inaugural president from 2003 to 2006. Likewise, the publication of the ''Encyclopaedia of Music in Ireland'' (2 volumes, 2013) would have been unthinkable without White, who has argued for such a publication repeatedly from as early as 1989.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=White |first=Harry |title=The Case for an Encyclopedia of Music in Ireland |journal=The Irish Review |volume=6 |issue=Spring 1989 |pages=39_45 |publisher=Cork University Press |location=Cork |date=1989 |url= |jstor=29735420 |issn= 0790-7850 |doi=10.2307/29735420 |accessdate= }}</ref> He became its joint editor, with Barra Boydell.\n\nIn his many articles on Irish music and in three monographs \u2013 ''The Keeper's Recital'' (1998), ''The Progress of Music in Ireland'' (2005) and ''Music and the Irish Literary Imagination'' (2008) \u2013 he has shed new light on the central role of music in Irish cultural and intellectual life; for the last-named book he was awarded the Michael J. Durkan Prize from the American Conference for Irish Studies (ACIS).<ref>{{cite web |title=Durkan Prize Recipients |work= |publisher=American Conference for Irish Studies |year=2018 |url=https://acisweb.org/durkan-prize-recipients |accessdate=31 March 2020 }}</ref>\n\n==Honours received==\nIn 2006, White became the first historical musicologist to be elected to the [[Royal Irish Academy]] after [[Aloys Fleischmann]] (1966) and [[John Blacking]] (1983). Other honours include Fellowship of the RIAM (2007) and the first DMus awarded by the [[National University of Ireland]] for published work in musicology (2007). He is also an Honorary Fellow of the Academy of St Cecilia (London). In acknowledgement of the publication of the ''Encyclopaedia of Music in Ireland'', both editors received the [[Frank Ll. Harrison|Harrison]] Medal of the Society for Musicology in Ireland in 2014. In 2015, he was elected to the [[Academia Europaea]], and in 2018 he was elected Corresponding Fellow of the [[Croatian Academy of Sciences and Arts]], the first Irish person to receive this honour.\n\nOn the occasion of his sixtieth birthday in 2018, he was honoured with a ''[[festschrift]]'', edited by Lorraine Byrne Bodley with contributions from more than 40 authors that is a testimony to White's wide research interests and his impressive circle of academic friends across the globe.<ref name=\"bodley elliott\"/> David Hiley wrote of it: \"This book is a fine tribute to a remarkable scholar. Not only has Harry White revealed unknown musical riches in Germany and Austria, he has set the music of Ireland in a clearer, truer perspective\".<ref>Quoted from the book jacket.</ref>\n\n==Poetry==\nThe eloquent, expressive and often poetic style of Harry White's musicological writing finds a more artistic outlet in his poetry. As a master's student in Toronto, he had already won the university's gold medal for poetry in 1984. Two published volumes of his poetry have appeared to date: ''Polite Forms'' (2012) and ''The Kenmare Occurrences'' (2018). ''Polite Forms'' has been described as \"a sequence of poems that meditates on family life\" that \"remember and reimagine scenes from childhood and adolescence\"<ref>{{cite web |title=Polite Forms |work= |publisher=Carysfort Press |date=30 March 2012 |url=http://carysfortpress.com/art-and-the-humanities-carysfort-press/polite-forms/ |accessdate=31 March 2020 }}</ref> Of his second collection, a Canadian critic wrote: \"White's strength is to hold both speaker and listener at a distance that is a kind of proximity; the poems acknowledge that memory is flawed, baffling, and all we have to go on.\"<ref>Chantel Lavoie, Professor of English Literature, Royal Military College of Canada, on the reverse cover of the book.</ref>\n\n==Selected writings==\n===Monographs===\n* ''The Keeper's Recital: Music and Cultural History in Ireland, 1770\u20131970'' (Cork: Cork University Press, 1998), {{ISBN|1-85918-171-6}}.\n* ''The Progress of Music in Ireland'' (Dublin: Four Courts Press, 2005), {{ISBN|1-85182-879-6}}.\n* ''Music and the Irish Literary Imagination'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2008), {{ISBN|978-0-19-954732-6}}.\n* ''The Well-tempered Festschrift.

Ranch Story: To The New World}}, is a farming [[Construction and management simulation|simulation]] [[video game]] developed by [[Marvelous Entertainment]] for the Nintendo 3DS. It was released in Japan on February 27, 2014, and in North America on March 31, 2015. This was the first game not under the ''[[Harvest Moon (2007 video game series)|Harvest Moon]]'' franchise title in North America due to Natsume's ownership of the name.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/05/28/harvest-moon-returns-in-story-of-seasons-on-3ds|title=Harvest Moon returns in Story of Seasons on 3DS|first=Colin|last=Moriarty|work=[[IGN]]|date=May 28, 2014|accessdate=April 7, 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe game follows along the same lines as the rest of the series, in which the player takes on the role of a farmer. The player can choose to play as a boy or girl farmer and choose between two difficulties at the beginning of the game. The difficulty can not be changed once chosen by the player. There are a variety of things to do in the game such as producing crops and raising livestock. The game also introduces new characters, including a tiny goddess and a tiny witch.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://operationrainfall.com/2014/02/24/new-characters-harvest-moon-linking-new-world/|title=(Japan) New Characters Introduced for Harvest Moon: Linking the New World|first= Antonin|last=Ko\u0159enek|work=[[Operation Rainfall]]|date=February 24, 2014|accessdate=April 7, 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Story==\nThe player is bored with their regular life and receives a flyer announcing the need for farmers in Oak Tree Town. Deciding to risk it all, the player moves to the small village. There are four other farmers living in Oak Tree Town, who will teach the player how to run their new farm. The ultimate goal is to unlock all seven vendors by fulfilling certain requirements and make Oak Tree Town a renowned international trade city. Large variety of seeds, items, buildings, and animals become available through unlocking the vendors. Together the NPC farmers and the player will help each other become successful.\n\n==Gameplay==\nThe main feature of the game is connectivity according to Yoshifumi Hashimoto, the producer of the ''Story of Seasons'' series. Players sell their crop and dairy products to other countries in the game via a Trade Station. Some countries prefer one type of item over another, and may have to travel to the other countries to make deliveries. Personal farm data can be swapped with other players using [[SpotPass and StreetPass#StreetPass|StreetPass]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.videogamesblogger.com/2014/03/02/top-10-bestselling-video-games-worldwide-in-week-9-2014.htm|title=Top 10 Bestselling Video Games Worldwide in Week 9, 2014|first=Ferry|last=Groenendijk|work=Video Games Blogger|date=March 2, 2015|accessdate=April 7, 2015}}</ref>\n\nCharacter customization is back from ''Harvest Moon: A New Beginning''. The player can control his or her hair style and color, eyes, skin color, hats, glasses, clothing outfits, and up to three accessories.\nFarming has been simplified to the 3x3 field. Sowing, watering, and harvesting can now be done to the entire 3x3 field instead of one at a time.  This allows the player to care for more fields in less time. Crops do not carry over to the next season like they did in ''A New Beginning''; once the first of the next season rolls around, all crops from the previous season that are still growing will be wilted and dead.{{citation needed|reason=New reference needed|date=May 2016}}\n\nThe player can set up a wildlife Safari, housing a variety of exotic animals such as monkeys and parrots. The Safari will be toured by the other villagers, similar to the Garden Tour in ''A New Beginning''. The exotic animals are added through the Safari through unlocking them from vendors in the game through having good relations with them. Other animals the player can only keep by meeting certain conditions. If the player becomes friendly with the animals through interaction they will be able to keep more animals in the Safari. Farm animals that are brought and taken care of within the Safari become happier and less stressed. In the Safari there is a mine where rare gems and minerals can be found through use of the hammer tool.<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.storyofseasons.com/farm12.html|title = Story of Seasons|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}</ref>\n\nThis game brought a new concept of in-game rival farmers and conquests. The player can compete with their rival farmers for more land within the game to plant crops. There are multiple lands and players compete through three different competitions, which are the following: seasonal festivals, amount of items shipped, and amount of money earned from shipping items. After winning players can rent the field for a temporary amount of time, until their time is up and they are challenged by the other farmers for the field if they do not renew in time.\n\nAlong with other games of the series this game brings back the dating mechanic, which includes six marriage candidates for the player to choose from. Getting married does not affect the storyline and does not unlock anything but the spouse does offer to forage for items after marriage. Marriage candidates depend on the gender of the character the player chose at the start. To get married, the player must raise friendship with the candidate, view all four flower events that are triggered through being at a specific friendship level (or higher) and setting, as well as upgrade their house size and give them a blue feather. The player can view two of the events before needing to get a commitment ring as a signal that they are dating in order to continue to view the other two events. After giving the candidate the ring the player is not allowed to view events for the other candidates.\n\nAlso in this game are combos. Equipping certain groupings of items such as rings, necklaces, and earrings can restore stamina and health to the player. There are combinations of items that can be placed in town that could increase prices that players can sell their items at, as well as combinations of items that will decrease the amount of time needed to create items.\n\n==Multiplayer==\nUnlocked on Spring 26 Year 1, Players can do multiplayer over Local connection or Internet, and with \"Anyone\" or \"Friends\", the latter required all parties have their 3DS friend codes registered in each other's system. Players can create a room for three visitors at most or search for an open room in the Multiplayer menu from starting screen. Player opening his/her farm needs to prepare three gifts for each visitor, and player who search for farm to visit also needs to prepare a gift for the host. The number of gift is varied between 1 and 5, depending on the type of item. There are some non-tradeable items, for example rare materials such as orichalcum, platinum; golden or plus products; some clothes and hats; etc.\n\nDuring the farm visit, players will be able to use a magic wand to sprinkle some magic to the host's plants and animals. The plants will receive star points, and the animals' stress level will be reduced (however, it does not increase animal's products star rank).

Ranch Story: To The New World}}, is a farming [[Construction and management simulation|simulation]] [[video game]] developed by [[Marvelous Entertainment]] for the Nintendo 3DS. It was released in Japan on February 27, 2014, and in North America on March 31, 2015. This was the first game not under the ''[[Harvest Moon]]'' franchise title in North America due to Natsume's ownership of the name.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/05/28/harvest-moon-returns-in-story-of-seasons-on-3ds|title=Harvest Moon returns in Story of Seasons on 3DS|first=Colin|last=Moriarty|work=[[IGN]]|date=May 28, 2014|accessdate=April 7, 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe game follows along the same lines as the rest of the series, in which the player takes on the role of a farmer. The player can choose to play as a boy or girl farmer and choose between two difficulties at the beginning of the game. The difficulty can not be changed once chosen by the player. There are a variety of things to do in the game such as producing crops and raising livestock. The game also introduces new characters, including a tiny goddess and a tiny witch.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://operationrainfall.com/2014/02/24/new-characters-harvest-moon-linking-new-world/|title=(Japan) New Characters Introduced for Harvest Moon: Linking the New World|first= Antonin|last=Ko\u0159enek|work=[[Operation Rainfall]]|date=February 24, 2014|accessdate=April 7, 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Story==\nThe player is bored with their regular life and receives a flyer announcing the need for farmers in Oak Tree Town. Deciding to risk it all, the player moves to the small village. There are four other farmers living in Oak Tree Town, who will teach the player how to run their new farm. The ultimate goal is to unlock all seven vendors by fulfilling certain requirements and make Oak Tree Town a renowned international trade city. Large variety of seeds, items, buildings, and animals become available through unlocking the vendors. Together the NPC farmers and the player will help each other become successful.\n\n==Gameplay==\nThe main feature of the game is connectivity according to Yoshifumi Hashimoto, the producer of the ''Story of Seasons'' series. Players sell their crop and dairy products to other countries in the game via a Trade Station. Some countries prefer one type of item over another, and may have to travel to the other countries to make deliveries. Personal farm data can be swapped with other players using [[SpotPass and StreetPass#StreetPass|StreetPass]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.videogamesblogger.com/2014/03/02/top-10-bestselling-video-games-worldwide-in-week-9-2014.htm|title=Top 10 Bestselling Video Games Worldwide in Week 9, 2014|first=Ferry|last=Groenendijk|work=Video Games Blogger|date=March 2, 2015|accessdate=April 7, 2015}}</ref>\n\nCharacter customization is back from ''Harvest Moon: A New Beginning''. The player can control his or her hair style and color, eyes, skin color, hats, glasses, clothing outfits, and up to three accessories.\nFarming has been simplified to the 3x3 field. Sowing, watering, and harvesting can now be done to the entire 3x3 field instead of one at a time.  This allows the player to care for more fields in less time. Crops do not carry over to the next season like they did in ''A New Beginning''; once the first of the next season rolls around, all crops from the previous season that are still growing will be wilted and dead.{{citation needed|reason=New reference needed|date=May 2016}}\n\nThe player can set up a wildlife Safari, housing a variety of exotic animals such as monkeys and parrots. The Safari will be toured by the other villagers, similar to the Garden Tour in ''A New Beginning''. The exotic animals are added through the Safari through unlocking them from vendors in the game through having good relations with them. Other animals the player can only keep by meeting certain conditions. If the player becomes friendly with the animals through interaction they will be able to keep more animals in the Safari. Farm animals that are brought and taken care of within the Safari become happier and less stressed. In the Safari there is a mine where rare gems and minerals can be found through use of the hammer tool.<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.storyofseasons.com/farm12.html|title = Story of Seasons|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}</ref>\n\nThis game brought a new concept of in-game rival farmers and conquests. The player can compete with their rival farmers for more land within the game to plant crops. There are multiple lands and players compete through three different competitions, which are the following: seasonal festivals, amount of items shipped, and amount of money earned from shipping items. After winning players can rent the field for a temporary amount of time, until their time is up and they are challenged by the other farmers for the field if they do not renew in time.\n\nAlong with other games of the series this game brings back the dating mechanic, which includes six marriage candidates for the player to choose from. Getting married does not affect the storyline and does not unlock anything but the spouse does offer to forage for items after marriage. Marriage candidates depend on the gender of the character the player chose at the start. To get married, the player must raise friendship with the candidate, view all four flower events that are triggered through being at a specific friendship level (or higher) and setting, as well as upgrade their house size and give them a blue feather. The player can view two of the events before needing to get a commitment ring as a signal that they are dating in order to continue to view the other two events. After giving the candidate the ring the player is not allowed to view events for the other candidates.\n\nAlso in this game are combos. Equipping certain groupings of items such as rings, necklaces, and earrings can restore stamina and health to the player. There are combinations of items that can be placed in town that could increase prices that players can sell their items at, as well as combinations of items that will decrease the amount of time needed to create items.\n\n==Multiplayer==\nUnlocked on Spring 26 Year 1, Players can do multiplayer over Local connection or Internet, and with \"Anyone\" or \"Friends\", the latter required all parties have their 3DS friend codes registered in each other's system. Players can create a room for three visitors at most or search for an open room in the Multiplayer menu from starting screen. Player opening his/her farm needs to prepare three gifts for each visitor, and player who search for farm to visit also needs to prepare a gift for the host. The number of gift is varied between 1 and 5, depending on the type of item. There are some non-tradeable items, for example rare materials such as orichalcum, platinum; golden or plus products; some clothes and hats; etc.\n\nDuring the farm visit, players will be able to use a magic wand to sprinkle some magic to the host's plants and animals. The plants will receive star points, and the animals' stress level will be reduced (however, it does not increase animal's products star rank). Hosting a multiplayer session in this game is highly beneficial to boost the plants' star rank. Wanding other players will give them ability to float mid-air by pressing and holding B button. Besides enjoying the farmland design, players can also look inside the host's house and admire the interior design.\n\nUnlike the predecessor, A New Beginning, the multiplayer in Story of Seasons is region-locked, meaning the trading and farm visits can only be done among players from the same region. This has caused confusion and disappointment for some players in Europe and North American region, and this limitation is blamed for the low rate of rooms in the multiplayer section.\n\n==Reception==\n{{Video game reviews\n| MC = 76/100<ref name=\"MC\">{{cite web |url=https://www.metacritic.com/game/3ds/story-of-seasons |title=Story of Seasons for 3DS Reviews |website=[[Metacritic]] |publisher=[[CBS Interactive]] |accessdate=September 25, 2018}}</ref>\n}}\n\nIn March 2014, ''Story of Seasons'' was the top selling game in Japan, at 131,000 units sold.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nintendolife.com/news/2014/03/harvest_moon_connect_to_a_new_world_dominates_for_3ds_in_japan|title=Harvest Moon: Connect To A New World Dominates for 3DS in Japan|first=Thomas|last=Whitehead|work=NintendoLife|date=March 5, 2014|accessdate=April 7, 2015}}</ref> ''[[IGN]]'' awarded it a score of 8.4 out of 10, saying \"''Story of Seasons'' successfully integrates both supply-and-demand economics and personality into the farm-life sim\".<ref>http://uk.ign.com/articles/2015/05/01/story-of-seasons-review</ref> It has a score of 76 out of 100 on [[Metacritic]] based on 39 reviews, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".<ref name=\"MC\" />\n\nIn July 2015, Xseed announced that ''Story of Seasons'' became their fastest-selling game ever, with over 100,000 units sold in North America.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Cowan|first1=Danny|title=Xseed reaps record-breaking sales from Story of Seasons on 3DS|url=http://www.digitaltrends.com/gaming/story-of-seasons-breaks-xseed-sales-record/|website=Digital Trends|accessdate=24 July 2015|date=16 July 2015}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.bokumono.com/series/tsunagaru/ Marvelous AQL Inc. page] {{in lang|ja}}\n*[http://www.storyofseasons.com/ Official website]\n\n{{Harvest Moon}}\n\n[[Category:2014 video games]]\n[[Category:Harvest Moon games]]\n[[Category:Marvelous Entertainment]]\n[[Category:Nintendo 3DS games]]\n[[Category:Nintendo 3DS eShop games]]\n[[Category:Nintendo 3DS-only games]]\n[[Category:Nintendo Network games]]\n[[Category:Video games developed in Japan]]\n[[Category:Video games featuring protagonists of selectable gender]]\n", "name_user": "Rodw", "label": "safe", "comment": "Disambiguating links toHarvest Moon(link changed toHarvest Moon (2007 video game series)) usingDisamAssist.", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Story_of_Seasons_(video_game)"}
