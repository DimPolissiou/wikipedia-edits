A. Kumi Attobrah (Kumi At\u0254bra) to be used as a [[lingua franca]] in all of [[Africa]]. The name of the language is a combination of ''Africa'' and ''[[Swahili language|Swahili]]''.  The author, a native of [[Akrokerri]] (Akrok\u025bri) in [[Ghana]], originally conceived of the idea in 1967 while on a sea voyage from [[Dover]] to [[Calais]].  His intention was that \"it would promote unity and understanding among the different peoples of the continent, reduce costs in printing due to translations and promote trade\".  It is meant to be easy for Africans to learn.\n\n==Source languages==\nAfrihili draws its [[phonology]], [[morphology (linguistics)|morphology]] and [[syntax]] from various [[African languages]], particularly [[Swahili language|Swahili]] and [[Akan language|Akan]] (Attobrah's native language). The [[lexicon]] covers various African languages, as well as words from many other sources \"so Africanized that they do not appear foreign\", although no specific etymologies are indicated by the author. However, the [[semantics]] is quite English, with many [[calque]]s of English expressions, perhaps due to the strong English influence on written Swahili and Akan. For example, ''mu'' is 'in', ''to'' is 'to', and ''muto'' is 'into'; similarly, ''kupitia'' is 'through' (as in 'through this remedy'), ''paasa'' is 'out' (as in to go outside), and ''kupitia-paasa'' is 'throughout'\u2014at least in the original, 1970 version of the language.\n\n==Script and pronunciation==\nThe language uses the [[Latin alphabet]] with the addition of two vowel letters, {{angle bracket|\u0190 \u025b}} and {{angle bracket|\u0186 \u0254}}, which have their values in Ghanaian languages and the [[International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]], {{IPAblink|\u025b}} and {{IPAblink|\u0254}}. Foreign names are spelled out phonetically rather than in the original orthography, so for example 'Hastings' is spelled ''Hestins''. There are two [[digraph (orthography)|digraphs]], {{angle bracket|ch}} and {{angle bracket|sh}}, which have their English and Swahili values, {{IPAblink|t\u0283}} and {{IPAblink|\u0283}}. ''J'' and ''y'' also have their English and Swahili values, {{IPAblink|d\u0292}} and {{IPAblink|j}}. ''Ng'' is not a digraph, but pronounced as in English ''finger'', {{IPA|[\u014b\u0261]}}.\n\nThere is no [[tone (linguistics)|tone]]. Stress is on the second-last vowel. Exclamation marks come at the beginning of a clause, which ends in a comma or period as normal; question marks come at the end.\n\n==Grammar==\nThe [[grammar]] is similar to Swahili, but in addition there is the 'vowel triangle', which is central to Afrihili inflection:\n\n              a\n            /   \\\n           u     e           \u025b\n          /       \\          \n         \u0254 __ o __ i\n\nMany grammatical processes are accomplished by exchanging a vowel with its directional opposite on the triangle: ''a'' for ''o'', ''u'' for ''i'', ''e'' for ''\u0254'', and vice versa. For example, a verb can be made into an adjective by changing its final vowel in this manner: from ''pinu'' 'to determine' comes the adjective ''pini'' 'determinate'. ''\u0190'' does not participate in these swaps, but is used in other situations (below).\n\nAll nouns, and only nouns and adjectives modifying nouns, begin with a vowel. In the singular this will be different from the final vowel of the word; the plural is formed by making it the same as the final vowel. For example, ''omulenzi'' 'boy' becomes ''imulenzi'' 'boys'; similarly, ''oluga'' is 'language' and ''aluga'' 'languages'.\n\nNouns are derived from verbs or adjectives by prefixing the opposite of the final vowel, according to the triangle above. So, from ''pinu'' 'to determine' comes the noun ''ipinu'' 'determination'. If all the vowels in the verb or adjective are the same, as in ''mono'' 'to disgrace' and ''kana'' 'one', then the neutral vowels ''\u025b-'' is used: ''\u025bmono'' 'a disgrace', ''\u025bkana'' 'unity'.\n\nVerbal nouns ([[gerund]]s) are formed from the [[infinitive]] in ''-de'',<ref>The ''-de'' form is used for [[subordinate clause|subordinate]] clauses, as in ''Kre tumil\u0254 dinga-de, nuliwate'' 'it being impossible to continue, we came back' (''kre'' 'it being', ''wa'' 'to come').</ref> and so always begin with ''\u0254-'' : ''soma'' 'reads', ''somade'' 'to read', ''\u0254somade y\u025b papa'' 'reading is good'. (Compare ''\u0254karatide'' 'harvesting' and ''ukarati'' 'a harvest', from ''karati'' 'to harvest'.)\n\nIn the opposite direction, nouns drop their initial vowels to form verbs, and with the appropriate change in final vowel, adjectives. So, from ''etogo'' 'a house' comes ''togo'' (or ''togode'') 'to house', and from ''umeme'' 'electricity' comes ''mem\u0254'' 'electric'.\n\n[[Participle]]s are formed with ''m\u025b-'', further derived as nouns or adjectives (gerunds): ''m\u025bpini'' 'determinative', ''\u025bm\u025bwako'' 'driver' (''wako'' to drive).\n\n[[Verb phrase]]s are formed with [[tense\u2013aspect\u2013mood|tense]] prefixes, with the subject pronouns written together with the verb. (Subject pronouns are not used if there is a noun subject.) Objects, however, are written separately after the verb: From ''jira'' 'to wait for', '''''mi'''ngijira '''l\u03b5''''' 'I (''mi-'') would have waited for him (''l\u025b'')'.\n\nPronouns include ''mi'' 'I', ''n\u025b'' 'me and you', ''n\u025bu'' [[Clusivity|'us and you']], ''nu'' [[Clusivity|'we' (not you)]], ''wu'' 'you (thou)' ''ku'' 'you (ye)', ''l\u025b'' 'he', ''ta'' 'she', ''yo'' 'it', ''fu'' 'they'. For possession, pronouns are prefixed on a noun, dropping their vowel: ''l'arafi'' 'his letter', ''w'agoji'' 'your money'.\n\nTense prefixes include ''li-'' (past), ''ta-'' (future), ''lii-'' (habitual past), ''taa-'' (habitual future), ''y\u025b\u025b-'' (habitual present), ''re-'' (present continuous -ing), ''ri-'' (past continuous -ing), ''ngi-'' (conditional, would), ''nge-'' (subjunctive, may), and a perfect in ''lo-''. Simple present is not marked. ''U-'' forms [[relative clause]]s (who, which).\n\nSo, from ''du'' 'eat', ''l\u025bdu'' 'he eats', ''n\u025btadu'' 'you & I will eat', ''fulidu'' 'they ate', ''miy\u025b\u025bdu \u025bn zinga'' 'I eat in the morning (as a matter of habit)', ''miliidu \u025bn zinga'' 'I would eat / used to eat in the morning', ''miredu'' 'I am eating', ''nuridu'' 'we were eating (when)', ''kama kungiwa, kungidu'' 'if y'all would come, you'd eat', ''ni omuntu lodu'' 'the man has eaten'.\n\n'This' and 'that' are ''ki'' and ''ka'', which are pluralized with the suffix ''-nga'', giving ''kinga'' 'these' and ''kanga'' 'those'. They may occur before a noun, or afterward by copying the final syllable: \n:''Ki omulenzi, omulenzi kinzi'' 'this boy'\n:''Ka omukama, omukama kama'' 'that king'\n:''Imukazi kangazi'' 'those girls'\n\nSome suffixes are full syllables, as ''-wi'' [[inchoative]] (to get or become): ''sana'' 'drink', ''sanawi'' 'get drunk'; ''furaha'' 'happy', ''furahawi'' 'be happy'. However, most have an [[echo vowel]], identical to the final vowel of the root, as in ''-bw-'' (passive): ''bona'' 'see', ''bonabwa'' 'be seen'; or ''-t-'' '-able': ''bonata'' 'visible', ''dutu'' 'edible'.\n\n'Of' ([[partitive]]?) is either a suffix ''-n'' or a particle ''pe'', with opposite word order. ''Nun kisi'' or ''kisi pe nu'' 'some of us', ''imulenzin kisi'' or ''kisi pen imulenzi'' 'some of the boys' (the definite article ''ni'' is here reduced and suffixed to ''pe'', giving ''pen'').\n\nWhen an adjective or numeral follows a noun, it takes the initial vowel of the noun as [[grammatical agreement]], as well as the suffix ''-n'':\n:''oluga ozurin na opapan'' 'a pleasant and good language'\n:''kana oluga, oluga okanan'' 'one language'\n\n==Sample phrases==\n\n:''Zuri lu'' \u2013 Good day (''alu'' 'a day')\n:''Zuri zinga'' \u2013 Good morning\n:''Zuri masa'' \u2013 Good afternoon\n:''Zuri dani'' \u2013 Good evening\n:''Zuri bali'' \u2013 Good night\n:''Jo koni'' \u2013 Go at once\n:''{{thinspace|!|Afuraho}}'' \u2013 Cheers!\n:''Sama papa obeka al dude'' \u2013 Find a good place to eat\n:''Kama mingipewa l'arafi gaba milijo paasa, mingijira l\u03b5.'' \u2013 If I had received his letter before I went out, I would have waited for him.\n\n:''Kwaku na Akua mai atapiro atajirin w\u025bna liwa yide fu kusa. Ni atapiro atajirin mai imulezi ibarin w\u025bna y\u025b f'amotsoala.

However, most have an [[echo vowel]], identical to the final vowel of the root, as in ''-bw-'' (passive): ''bona'' 'see', ''bonabwa'' 'be seen'; or ''-t-'' '-able': ''bonata'' 'visible', ''dutu'' 'edible'.\n\n'Of' ([[partitive]]?) is either a suffix ''-n'' or a particle ''pe'', with opposite word order. ''Nun kisi'' or ''kisi pe nu'' 'some of us', ''imulenzin kisi'' or ''kisi pen imulenzi'' 'some of the boys' (the definite article ''ni'' is here reduced and suffixed to ''pe'', giving ''pen'').\n\nWhen an adjective or numeral follows a noun, it takes the initial vowel of the noun as [[grammatical agreement]], as well as the suffix ''-n'':\n:''oluga ozurin na opapan'' 'a pleasant and good language'\n:''kana oluga, oluga okanan'' 'one language'\n\n==Sample phrases==\n\n:''Zuri lu'' \u2013 Good day (''alu'' 'a day')\n:''Zuri zinga'' \u2013 Good morning\n:''Zuri masa'' \u2013 Good afternoon\n:''Zuri dani'' \u2013 Good evening\n:''Zuri bali'' \u2013 Good night\n:''Jo koni'' \u2013 Go at once\n:''{{thinspace|!|Afuraho}}'' \u2013 Cheers!\n:''Sama papa obeka al dude'' \u2013 Find a good place to eat\n:''Kama mingipewa l'arafi gaba milijo paasa, mingijira l\u03b5.'' \u2013 If I had received his letter before I went out, I would have waited for him.\n\n:''Kwaku na Akua mai atapiro atajirin w\u025bna liwa yide fu kusa.

As of 2013, the town has a population of 7,476 inhabitants, while the municipality has 10,807 inhabitants.\n\n==History==\n{{refimprove|section|date=June 2018}}\nThe first traces of civilization in Bile\u0107a date from the [[Neolithic period]], although archaeological sites are insufficiently explored. The first written documentation of Bile\u0107a as an inhabited place can be found in [[Republic of Ragusa|Ragusan]] documents dating from 1286, when it is mentioned under the name ''Bilechia''. Bile\u0107a is mentioned in the 14th and 15th century as an important cross road town in caravan routes. A document dated 8 September 1388, mentions that the army of duke [[Vlatko Vukovi\u0107]] defeated the [[Turkish army]] at the [[Battle of Bile\u0107a]]. In the period from 13th to 16th century in the history of this area is a large number of the \"ste\u0107ci\" monolith markers which weigh up to 5 tons. Bile\u0107a was held by the Turks from 1466, although this was a rebellious area difficult to control. Nearby lies the town of Vu\u010dji Do, in which the [[Battle of Vu\u010dji Do]] took place in 1876. The Berlin's Congress included Bile\u0107a in the [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]], which brought economic development to the region. The first primary school in Bile\u0107a was opened in 1880.\n\n==Settlements==\nAside from the town of Bile\u0107a, the municipality includes the following settlements:\n{{div col|colwidth=22em}}\n* [[Baljci, Bile\u0107a|Baljci]]\n* [[Bijela Rudina]]\n* [[Bijeljani]]\n* [[Bodenik]]\n* [[Bogda\u0161i\u0107i, Bile\u0107a|Bogda\u0161i\u0107i]]\n* [[Brestice]]\n* [[\u010cepelica]]\n* [[Deleu\u0161a]]\n* [[Divin, Bile\u0107a|Divin]]\n* [[Dlako\u0161e]]\n* [[Dola, Bile\u0107a|Dola]]\n* [[Donja Meka Gruda]]\n* [[Donji Davidovi\u0107i]]\n* [[\u0110e\u010de]]\n* [[Fatnica]]\n* [[Golobr\u0111e]]\n* [[Gornja Meka Gruda]]\n* [[Gornji Davidovi\u0107i]]\n* [[Granica, Bile\u0107a|Granica]]\n* [[Hod\u017ei\u0107i, Bile\u0107a|Hod\u017ei\u0107i]]\n* [[Ka\u010danj]]\n* [[Kalac, Bile\u0107a|Kalac]]\n* [[Korita, Bile\u0107a|Korita]]\n* [[Kriva\u010da]]\n* [[Krsta\u010de]]\n* [[Kukri\u010dje]]\n* [[Kuti, Bile\u0107a|Kuti]]\n* [[La\u0111evi\u0107i, Bile\u0107a|La\u0111evi\u0107i]]\n* [[Milavi\u0107i]]\n* [[Mirilovi\u0107i]]\n* [[Miru\u0161e]]\n* [[Mre\u017eica, Bile\u0107a|Mre\u017eica]]\n* [[Narat]]\n* [[Njeganovi\u0107i]]\n* [[Oblo Brdo]]\n* [[Orah, Bile\u0107a|Orah]]\n* [[Orahovice (Bile\u0107a)|Orahovice]]\n* [[Pa\u0111eni]]\n* [[Panik, Bile\u0107a|Panik]]\n* [[Plana, Bile\u0107a|Plana]]\n* [[Podgorje, Bile\u0107a|Podgorje]]\n* [[Podosoje, Bile\u0107a|Podosoje]]\n* [[Preraca]]\n* [[Prijevor, Bile\u0107a|Prijevor]]\n* [[Prisoje, Bile\u0107a|Prisoje]]\n* [[Rioca]]\n* [[Seli\u0161ta, Bile\u0107a|Seli\u0161ta]]\n* [[Simijova]]\n* [[Skrobotno]]\n* [[\u0160obadine]]\n* [[Todori\u0107i, Bile\u0107a|Todori\u0107i]]\n* [[Tori\u010d]]\n* [[Trnovica, Bile\u0107a|Trnovica]]\n* [[Vlahinja, Bile\u0107a|Vlahinja]]\n* [[Vranjska, Bile\u0107a|Vranjska]]\n* [[Vrbica, Bile\u0107a|Vrbica]]\n* [[Zasada]]\n* [[Zau\u0161je]]\n* [[Zvijerina]]\n* [[\u017dudojevi\u0107i]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Demographics==\n\n=== Population ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! colspan=\"9\" |Population of settlements \u2013 Bile\u0107a municipality\n|-\n|\n|Settlement\n|1948.\n|1953.\n|1961.\n|1971.\n|1981.\n|1991.\n|2013.\n|-\n|\n|Total\n|13,531\n|14.026\n|14,125\n|13,444\n|13,199\n|13,284\n|10,807\n|-\n|1\n|Baljci\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|417\n|293\n|-\n|2\n|'''Bile\u0107a'''\n|1,270\n|1,563\n|2,491\n|4,033\n|5,763\n|7,568\n|7,476\n|-\n|3\n|Podosoje\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|971\n|1,055\n|}\n<br />\n===Ethnic composition===\nAccording to the 1910 census, the absolute majority in the Bile\u0107a municipality were Orthodox Christians (82.27%).

As of 2013, the town has a population of 7,476 inhabitants, while the municipality has 10,807 inhabitants.\n\n==History==\n{{refimprove|section|date=June 2018}}\nThe first traces of civilization in Bile\u0107a date from the [[Neolithic period]], although archaeological sites are insufficiently explored. The first written documentation of Bile\u0107a as an inhabited place can be found in [[Republic of Ragusa|Ragusan]] documents dating from 1286, when it is mentioned under the name ''Bilechia''. Bile\u0107a is mentioned in the 14th and 15th century as an important cross road town in caravan routes. A document dated 8 September 1388, mentions that the army of duke [[Vlatko Vukovi\u0107]] defeated the [[Turkish army]] at the [[Battle of Bile\u0107a]]. In the period from 13th to 16th century in the history of this area is a large number of the \"ste\u0107ci\" monolith markers which weigh up to 5 tons. Bile\u0107a was held by the Turks from 1466, although this was a rebellious area difficult to control. Nearby lies the town of Vu\u010dji Do, in which the [[Battle of Vu\u010dji Do]] took place in 1876. The Berlin's Congress included Bile\u0107a in the [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]], which brought economic development to the region. The first primary school in Bile\u0107a was opened in 1880.\n\n==Settlements==\nAside from the town of Bile\u0107a, the municipality includes the following settlements:\n{{div col|colwidth=22em}}\n* [[Baljci, Bile\u0107a|Baljci]]\n* [[Bijela Rudina]]\n* [[Bijeljani]]\n* [[Bodenik]]\n* [[Bogda\u0161i\u0107i, Bile\u0107a|Bogda\u0161i\u0107i]]\n* [[Brestice]]\n* [[\u010cepelica]]\n* [[Deleu\u0161a]]\n* [[Divin, Bile\u0107a|Divin]]\n* [[Dlako\u0161e]]\n* [[Dola, Bile\u0107a|Dola]]\n* [[Donja Meka Gruda]]\n* [[Donji Davidovi\u0107i]]\n* [[\u0110e\u010de]]\n* [[Fatnica]]\n* [[Golobr\u0111e]]\n* [[Gornja Meka Gruda]]\n* [[Gornji Davidovi\u0107i]]\n* [[Granica, Bile\u0107a|Granica]]\n* [[Hod\u017ei\u0107i, Bile\u0107a|Hod\u017ei\u0107i]]\n* [[Ka\u010danj]]\n* [[Kalac, Bile\u0107a|Kalac]]\n* [[Korita, Bile\u0107a|Korita]]\n* [[Kriva\u010da]]\n* [[Krsta\u010de]]\n* [[Kukri\u010dje]]\n* [[Kuti, Bile\u0107a|Kuti]]\n* [[La\u0111evi\u0107i, Bile\u0107a|La\u0111evi\u0107i]]\n* [[Milavi\u0107i]]\n* [[Mirilovi\u0107i]]\n* [[Miru\u0161e]]\n* [[Mre\u017eica, Bile\u0107a|Mre\u017eica]]\n* [[Narat]]\n* [[Njeganovi\u0107i]]\n* [[Oblo Brdo]]\n* [[Orah, Bile\u0107a|Orah]]\n* [[Orahovice (Bile\u0107a)|Orahovice]]\n* [[Pa\u0111eni]]\n* [[Panik, Bile\u0107a|Panik]]\n* [[Plana, Bile\u0107a|Plana]]\n* [[Podgorje, Bile\u0107a|Podgorje]]\n* [[Podosoje, Bile\u0107a|Podosoje]]\n* [[Preraca]]\n* [[Prijevor, Bile\u0107a|Prijevor]]\n* [[Prisoje, Bile\u0107a|Prisoje]]\n* [[Rioca]]\n* [[Seli\u0161ta, Bile\u0107a|Seli\u0161ta]]\n* [[Simijova]]\n* [[Skrobotno]]\n* [[\u0160obadine]]\n* [[Todori\u0107i, Bile\u0107a|Todori\u0107i]]\n* [[Tori\u010d]]\n* [[Trnovica, Bile\u0107a|Trnovica]]\n* [[Vlahinja, Bile\u0107a|Vlahinja]]\n* [[Vranjska, Bile\u0107a|Vranjska]]\n* [[Vrbica, Bile\u0107a|Vrbica]]\n* [[Zasada]]\n* [[Zau\u0161je]]\n* [[Zvijerina]]\n* [[\u017dudojevi\u0107i]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Demographics==\n\n=== Population ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! colspan=\"9\" |Population of settlements \u2013 Bile\u0107a municipality\n|-\n|\n|Settlement\n|1948.\n|1953.\n|1961.\n|1971.\n|1981.\n|1991.\n|2013.\n|-\n|\n|Total\n|13,531\n|14.026\n|14,125\n|13,444\n|13,199\n|13,284\n|10,807\n|-\n|1\n|Baljci\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|417\n|293\n|-\n|2\n|'''Bile\u0107a'''\n|1,270\n|1,563\n|2,491\n|4,033\n|5,763\n|7,568\n|7,476\n|-\n|3\n|Podosoje\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|971\n|1,055\n|}\n<br />\n===Ethnic composition===\nAccording to the 1910 census, the absolute majority in the Bile\u0107a municipality were Orthodox Christians (82.27%).

The city forms a cross-border [[Twin cities|twin city]] together with [[Haparanda]] on the Swedish side. The municipality covers an area of {{convert|{{Infobox Finnish Municipality/total area|Tornio}}|km2}}, of which {{convert|{{Infobox Finnish Municipality/waters area|Tornio}}|km2|abbr=on}} is water.<ref name=\"total_area\" /> The [[population density]] is {{convert|{{Infobox Finnish Municipality/population density|Tornio|round=2}}|PD/km2}}, with a total population of {{formatnum: {{Infobox Finnish Municipality/population count|Tornio}}}} ({{#time: j F Y|{{Infobox Finnish Municipality/population count|sourcedate}} }}).<ref name=\"population_count\" /> It borders the [[Sweden|Swedish]] municipality of [[Haparanda]] (in {{lang-fi|Haaparanta}}).\n\nIn spite of being a border city Tornio is unilingually [[Finnish language|Finnish]] with a negligible number of native [[Swedish language|Swedish speakers]], although this does not count vast numbers of bilinguals who speak Swedish as a second language, with an official target of universal working bilingualism for both border municipalities.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nsd.se/nyheter/tvasprakighet-hogt-pa-dagordningen-5139151.aspx|title=Tv\u00e5spr\u00e5kighet h\u00f6gt p\u00e5 dagordningen|publisher=NSD|language=sv|date=23 January 2010|accessdate=5 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n== History ==\nThe delta of the [[Torne river]] has been inhabited since the end of the [[Last glacial period|last ice age]], and there are currently (1995) 16 settlement sites (''boplatsvallar'') known in the area, similar to those found in [[Vuollerim]] (c. 6000\u20135000 BC).  The Swedish part of the region is not far from the oldest permanent settlement site found in Scandinavia.<ref>as currently known in 2004.</ref>  A former hypothesis that this region was uninhabited and \"colonised\" from the [[Viking Age]] onward has now been abandoned.\n\nThe church spire at Tornio was one of the landmarks used by [[Pierre Louis Moreau de Maupertuis|de Maupertuis]] in his measurements.  The church was constructed in 1686 by Matti Joosepinpoika H\u00e4rm\u00e4.\n\nUntil the 19th century, inhabitants of the surrounding countryside spoke [[Finnish language|Finnish]], and [[Kemi Sami]], a language of the Eastern Sami group similar to Finnish, while those of the town were mainly Swedish-speaking.\n\nThe name 'Tornio' is an old Finnish word meaning war spear: the city is named after the river.<ref>{{cite book|last=Vahtola|first=Jouko|title=Studia Historica Sptentrionalia 3|date=1980|location=Rovaniemi|isbn=951-95472-1-5|pages=102\u2013107|language=Finnish}}</ref>  To Swedish it was borrowed as ''Torne\u00e5'' after ''Torne \u00e5'', an alternative name of the river.\n\nThe town received its charter from the King of Sweden in 1621 and was officially founded on the island of Suensaari (possibly named after one of the main landowners of the past). The charter was granted in recognition of Tornio being the hub of all trade in Lapland throughout the 16th century. It was the largest merchant town in the North at the time and for some years ranked as the richest town in the Swedish realm. Despite the lively trade with Lapland and overseas, the population of the town remained stable for hundreds of years at little over 500.\n\nDuring the 18th century Tornio was visited by several expeditions from Central Europe which came to explore the [[Arctic]].  The most notable expedition (1736\u20131737) was led by a member of the [[Acad\u00e9mie fran\u00e7aise]], [[Pierre Louis Moreau de Maupertuis]], who came to take [[meridian arc]] measurements along the [[Me\u00e4nmaa]] which would show that the globe is flattened towards the poles.\n\nThe Lapland trade on which Tornio depended started to decline in the 18th century, and the harbour had to be moved downriver twice as a result of the rising of the land ([[post-glacial rebound]]), which made the river too shallow for navigation. However, the greatest blow to the wealth of the town came in the last war between Sweden and Russia in 1808, which saw the Russians capture and annexe Finland.  The border was drawn through the deepest channel of the [[Muonio]] and Tornio rivers, splitting Lapland into two parts, with deleterious effects on trade. Tornio ended up on the Russian side of the border by special request of the Russian czar. The Swedes developed the village of Haaparanta (present day [[Haparanda]]) on their side of the border, to balance the loss of Tornio, and Tornio became unilingually Finnish.\n\nDuring the Russian period Tornio was a sleepy garrison town. Trade only livened up during the [[Crimean War]] and the [[World War I|First World War]], when Tornio became an important border crossing for goods and people. During the First World War Tornio and Haparanda had the only rail link connecting the Russians to their Western allies.\n\nAfter the independence of Finland in 1917 Tornio lost its garrison and experienced further decline. although its population increased steadily. The town played no role of importance in the [[Finnish Civil War]], but was the scene of some fierce street fighting at the onset of the [[Lapland War]] between Finland and [[Nazi Germany]]. The rapid [[Battle of Tornio|liberation of the town]] by Finnish forces probably saved it from being burned down like so many other towns in Lapland. As a result, the beautiful wooden church from 1686 can still be admired today.\n\nAfter World War II, the town created new employment built on the success of the local [[Lapin Kulta]] brewery and the [[Outokumpu]] stainless steel mill. Tourism based on the border has also been a growing industry. The town is a centre of education for Western Lapland with a [[vocational school|vocational college]] and a [[Kemi-Tornio University of Applied Sciences|university of applied sciences]].\n\nTornio and Haparanda have a history as [[twin cities]], and are currently set to merge under the names TornioHaparanda and HaparandaTornio. A new city centre is under construction on the international border and several municipal services are shared.<ref name=\"rajalla_p\u00e5_gr\u00e4nsen\">[http://www.pagransen.com/eng/engstart.html Rajalla \u2013 P\u00e5 Gr\u00e4nsen] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070628224433/http://www.pagransen.com/eng/engstart.html |date=June 28, 2007 }}</ref> The towns also share a common [[golf]] course, situated astride the border. The new [[IKEA]] store in Haparanda has signposting in Finnish as well as in Swedish, and all prices are signposted in two currencies.\n\n==Sports==\n\n[[Tornion Palloveikot]], or just ToPV, is a [[bandy]] club which play in the [[Bandyliiga]] and has become [[list of Finnish bandy champions|Finnish bandy champions]] several times. They play their home matches in [[Haparanda]], just on the other side of the Swedish border, which was the venue for games at the [[2001 Bandy World Championship|2001]] [[Bandy World Championship]].\n\n[[Teemu Tainio]], footballer, was born in Tornio.\n\n[[Jesse Puljuj\u00e4rvi]], ice hockey player, lived his childhood in Tornio.\n\n[[Ville Pokka]], ice hockey player, was born and raised in Tornio.\n\n==Climate==\nTornio has a [[subarctic climate]] that is slightly tempered in winter by its proximity to the sea, but retains warm continental summers that are quite short.

{{lang-se|Duortnus}}) is a [[city]] and [[municipalities of Finland|municipality]] in [[Lapland, Finland]].  The city forms a cross-border [[Twin cities|twin city]] together with [[Haparanda]] on the Swedish side. The municipality covers an area of {{convert|{{Infobox Finnish Municipality/total area|Tornio}}|km2}}, of which {{convert|{{Infobox Finnish Municipality/waters area|Tornio}}|km2|abbr=on}} is water.<ref name=\"total_area\" /> The [[population density]] is {{convert|{{Infobox Finnish Municipality/population density|Tornio|round=2}}|PD/km2}}, with a total population of {{formatnum: {{Infobox Finnish Municipality/population count|Tornio}}}} ({{#time: j F Y|{{Infobox Finnish Municipality/population count|sourcedate}} }}).<ref name=\"population_count\" /> It borders the [[Sweden|Swedish]] municipality of [[Haparanda]] (in {{lang-fi|Haaparanta}}).\n\nIn spite of being a border city Tornio is unilingually [[Finnish language|Finnish]] with a negligible number of native [[Swedish language|Swedish speakers]], although this does not count vast numbers of bilinguals who speak Swedish as a second language, with an official target of working bilingualism for both border municipalities.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nsd.se/nyheter/tvasprakighet-hogt-pa-dagordningen-5139151.aspx|title=Tv\u00e5spr\u00e5kighet h\u00f6gt p\u00e5 dagordningen|publisher=NSD|language=sv|date=23 January 2010|accessdate=5 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n== History ==\nThe delta of the [[Torne river]] has been inhabited since the end of the [[Last glacial period|last ice age]], and there are currently (1995) 16 settlement sites (''boplatsvallar'') known in the area, similar to those found in [[Vuollerim]] (c. 6000\u20135000 BC).  The Swedish part of the region is not far from the oldest permanent settlement site found in Scandinavia.<ref>as currently known in 2004.</ref>  A former hypothesis that this region was uninhabited and \"colonised\" from the [[Viking Age]] onward has now been abandoned.\n\nThe church spire at Tornio was one of the landmarks used by [[Pierre Louis Moreau de Maupertuis|de Maupertuis]] in his measurements.  The church was constructed in 1686 by Matti Joosepinpoika H\u00e4rm\u00e4.\n\nUntil the 19th century, inhabitants of the surrounding countryside spoke [[Finnish language|Finnish]], and [[Kemi Sami]], a language of the Eastern Sami group similar to Finnish, while those of the town were mainly Swedish-speaking.\n\nThe name 'Tornio' is an old Finnish word meaning war spear: the city is named after the river.<ref>{{cite book|last=Vahtola|first=Jouko|title=Studia Historica Sptentrionalia 3|date=1980|location=Rovaniemi|isbn=951-95472-1-5|pages=102\u2013107|language=Finnish}}</ref>  To Swedish it was borrowed as ''Torne\u00e5'' after ''Torne \u00e5'', an alternative name of the river.\n\nThe town received its charter from the King of Sweden in 1621 and was officially founded on the island of Suensaari (possibly named after one of the main landowners of the past). The charter was granted in recognition of Tornio being the hub of all trade in Lapland throughout the 16th century. It was the largest merchant town in the North at the time and for some years ranked as the richest town in the Swedish realm. Despite the lively trade with Lapland and overseas, the population of the town remained stable for hundreds of years at little over 500.\n\nDuring the 18th century Tornio was visited by several expeditions from Central Europe which came to explore the [[Arctic]].  The most notable expedition (1736\u20131737) was led by a member of the [[Acad\u00e9mie fran\u00e7aise]], [[Pierre Louis Moreau de Maupertuis]], who came to take [[meridian arc]] measurements along the [[Me\u00e4nmaa]] which would show that the globe is flattened towards the poles.\n\nThe Lapland trade on which Tornio depended started to decline in the 18th century, and the harbour had to be moved downriver twice as a result of the rising of the land ([[post-glacial rebound]]), which made the river too shallow for navigation. However, the greatest blow to the wealth of the town came in the last war between Sweden and Russia in 1808, which saw the Russians capture and annexe Finland.  The border was drawn through the deepest channel of the [[Muonio]] and Tornio rivers, splitting Lapland into two parts, with deleterious effects on trade. Tornio ended up on the Russian side of the border by special request of the Russian czar. The Swedes developed the village of Haaparanta (present day [[Haparanda]]) on their side of the border, to balance the loss of Tornio, and Tornio became unilingually Finnish.\n\nDuring the Russian period Tornio was a sleepy garrison town. Trade only livened up during the [[Crimean War]] and the [[World War I|First World War]], when Tornio became an important border crossing for goods and people. During the First World War Tornio and Haparanda had the only rail link connecting the Russians to their Western allies.\n\nAfter the independence of Finland in 1917 Tornio lost its garrison and experienced further decline. although its population increased steadily. The town played no role of importance in the [[Finnish Civil War]], but was the scene of some fierce street fighting at the onset of the [[Lapland War]] between Finland and [[Nazi Germany]]. The rapid [[Battle of Tornio|liberation of the town]] by Finnish forces probably saved it from being burned down like so many other towns in Lapland. As a result, the beautiful wooden church from 1686 can still be admired today.\n\nAfter World War II, the town created new employment built on the success of the local [[Lapin Kulta]] brewery and the [[Outokumpu]] stainless steel mill. Tourism based on the border has also been a growing industry. The town is a centre of education for Western Lapland with a [[vocational school|vocational college]] and a [[Kemi-Tornio University of Applied Sciences|university of applied sciences]].\n\nTornio and Haparanda have a history as [[twin cities]], and are currently set to merge under the names TornioHaparanda and HaparandaTornio. A new city centre is under construction on the international border and several municipal services are shared.<ref name=\"rajalla_p\u00e5_gr\u00e4nsen\">[http://www.pagransen.com/eng/engstart.html Rajalla \u2013 P\u00e5 Gr\u00e4nsen] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070628224433/http://www.pagransen.com/eng/engstart.html |date=June 28, 2007 }}</ref> The towns also share a common [[golf]] course, situated astride the border. The new [[IKEA]] store in Haparanda has signposting in Finnish as well as in Swedish, and all prices are signposted in two currencies.\n\n==Sports==\n\n[[Tornion Palloveikot]], or just ToPV, is a [[bandy]] club which play in the [[Bandyliiga]] and has become [[list of Finnish bandy champions|Finnish bandy champions]] several times. They play their home matches in [[Haparanda]], just on the other side of the Swedish border, which was the venue for games at the [[2001 Bandy World Championship|2001]] [[Bandy World Championship]].\n\n[[Teemu Tainio]], footballer, was born in Tornio.\n\n[[Jesse Puljuj\u00e4rvi]], ice hockey player, lived his childhood in Tornio.\n\n[[Ville Pokka]], ice hockey player, was born and raised in Tornio.\n\n==Climate==\nTornio has a [[subarctic climate]] that is slightly tempered in winter by its proximity to the sea, but retains warm continental summers that are quite short. The weatherbox is from neighbouring city Haparanda and operated by [[Swedish Meteorological and Hydrological Institute]]. Despite the fact that Tornio experiences [[polar day]] between 15 and 27 June (13 days) it does not experience [[polar night]].\n\n\n{{Weather box\n|collapsed = \n|metric first = yes\n|single line = yes\n|location = Haparanda (adjacent to Tornio) (2002\u20132018; extremes since 1901)\n|Jan record high C = 8.4\n|Feb record high C = 7.8\n|Mar record high C = 10.3\n|Apr record high C = 18.5\n|May record high C = 28.8\n|Jun record high C = 31.4\n|Jul record high C = 33.6\n|Aug record high C = 29.7\n|Sep record high C = 24.0\n|Oct record high C = 17.0\n|Nov record high C = 11.5\n|Dec record high C = 7.0\n|year record high C = \n|Jan avg record high C = 2.3\n|Feb avg record high C = 3.2\n|Mar avg record high C = 7.4\n|Apr avg record high C = 12.8\n|May avg record high C = 22.3\n|Jun avg record high C = 24.8\n|Jul avg record high C = 26.8\n|Aug avg record high C = 24.7\n|Sep avg record high C = 18.6\n|Oct avg record high C = 11.7\n|Nov avg record high C = 6.4\n|Dec avg record high C = 3.7\n|year avg record high C = 27.7\n|Jan high C = -6.0\n|Feb high C = -5.3\n|Mar high C = -0.5\n|Apr high C = 5.4\n|May high C = 12.4\n|Jun high C = 17.5\n|Jul high C = 21.2\n|Aug high C = 18.7\n|Sep high C = 13.3\n|Oct high C = 5.6\n|Nov high C = 0.4\n|Dec high C = -2.7\n|year high C = \n|Jan mean C = -9.9\n|Feb mean C = -9.3\n|Mar mean C = -5.1\n|Apr mean C = 1.1\n|May mean C = 7.6\n|Jun mean C = 12.7\n|Jul mean C = 16.6\n|Aug mean C = 14.5\n|Sep mean C = 9.4\n|Oct mean C = 2.4\n|Nov mean C = -2.4\n|Dec mean C = -6.2\n|year mean C = \n|Jan low C = -13.7\n|Feb low C = -13.2\n|Mar low C = -9.7\n|Apr low C = -3.2\n|May low C = 2.7\n|Jun low C = 7.9\n|Jul low C = 12.0\n|Aug low C = 10.2\n|Sep low C = 5.5\n|Oct low C = -0.9\n|Nov low C = -5.2\n|Dec low C = -9.6\n|year low C = \n|Jan avg record low C = -28.0\n|Feb avg record low C = -27.3\n|Mar avg record low C = -22.4\n|Apr avg record low C = -12.1\n|May avg record low C = -4.0\n|Jun avg record low C = 1.8\n|Jul avg record low C = 5.3\n|Aug avg record low C = 2.2\n|Sep avg record low C = -2.4\n|Oct avg record low C = -10.1\n|Nov avg record low C = -16.3\n|Dec avg record low C = -22.1\n|year avg record low C = -29.9\n|Jan record low C = -40.8\n|Feb record low C = -41.7\n|Mar record low C = -37.5\n|Apr record low C = -26.0\n|May record low C = -10.5\n|Jun record low C = -1.5\n|Jul record low C = 2.2\n|Aug record low C = -1.8\n|Sep record low C = -8.1\n|Oct record low C = -23.0\n|Nov record low C = -32.3\n|Dec record low C = -37.3\n|year record low C = \n|precipitation colour = green\n|Jan precipitation mm = 56.5\n|Feb precipitation mm = 42.0\n|Mar precipitation mm = 35.3\n|Apr precipitation mm = 34.1\n|May precipitation mm = 44.8\n|Jun precipitation mm = 49.7\n|Jul precipitation mm = 59.7\n|Aug precipitation mm = 56.8\n|Sep precipitation mm = 63.5\n|Oct precipitation mm = 53.9\n|Nov precipitation mm = 66.5\n|Dec precipitation mm = 61.4\n|year precipitation mm = \n|source 1 = SMHI Open Data <ref>{{cite web|author=|url=https://www.smhi.se/klimatdata/meteorologi/ladda-ner-meteorologiska-observationer/#param=precipitationMonthlySum,stations=all,stationid=163960|title=SMHI Open Data|publisher=[[Swedish Meteorological and Hydrological Institute]]|language=sv|accessdate=24 April 2019}}</ref>\n|source 2 = SMHI Monthly Data <ref>{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.smhi.se/klimatdata/meteorologi/temperatur/2.1240 |title=SMHI Average Monthly Data 2002\u20132018|publisher=[[Swedish Meteorological and Hydrological Institute]]|language=sv|accessdate=24 April 2019}}</ref>\n}}\n\n== Transport ==\n[[File:Haparanda-Tornio rail bridge Sep2008.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Torne River Railway Bridge]] over [[Torne river]] with [[dual gauge]] [[Gauntlet track|tracks]].]]\nA [[break of gauge]] occurs at Tornio between the Finnish and Swedish railway systems.

In the early 2000s, [[Shana Poplack]] provided [[corpus linguistics|corpus]]-based evidence{{sfnp|Poplack|2000|p=?}}{{sfnp|Poplack|Tagliamonte|2001|p=?}}\u2014evidence from a body of writing\u2014from isolated enclaves in [[Saman\u00e1 Peninsula|Saman\u00e1]] and [[African Nova Scotian English|Nova Scotia]] peopled by descendants of migrations of early AAVE-speaking groups (see [[Saman\u00e1 English]]) that suggests that the grammar of early AAVE was closer to that of contemporary British dialects than modern urban AAVE is to other current American dialects, suggesting that the modern language is a result of divergence from mainstream varieties, rather than the result of decreolization from a widespread American creole.<ref>William Labov, in the Foreword to {{Harvcoltxt|Poplack|Tagliamonte|2001}}, says \"I would like to think that this clear demonstration of the similarities among the three diaspora dialects and the White benchmark dialects, combined with their differences from creole grammars, would close at least one chapter in the history of the creole controversies.\"</ref>\n\nLinguist [[John McWhorter]] maintains that the contribution of West African languages to AAVE is minimal. In an interview on [[National Public Radio]]'s ''Talk of the Nation'', McWhorter characterized AAVE as a \"hybrid of regional dialects of Great Britain that slaves in America were exposed to because they often worked alongside the indentured servants who spoke those dialects...\" According to McWhorter, virtually all linguists who have carefully studied the origins of AAVE \"agree that the West African connection is quite minor.\"<ref>Ludden, Jennifer (September 6, 2010). [https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=129682981 \"Op-Ed: DEA Call For Ebonics Experts Smart Move\"]. [[NPR]].</ref>\n\nHowever, a creole theory, less accepted among linguists, posits that AAVE arose from one or more [[creole language]]s used by African captives of the [[Atlantic slave trade]], due to the captives speaking many different native languages and therefore needing a new way to communicate among themselves and with their captors.{{sfnp|Wolfram|1998|p=112}}  According to this theory, these captives first developed what are called [[pidgin]]s: simplified mixtures of languages. Since pidgins form from close contact between speakers of different languages, the slave trade would have been exactly such a situation. Creolist John Dillard quotes, for example, [[slave ship]] captain William Smith describing the sheer diversity of mutually unintelligible languages just in [[The Gambia]].{{sfnp|Dillard|1972|p=??}} By 1715, an African pidgin was reproduced in novels by [[Daniel Defoe]], in particular, ''The Life of Colonel Jacque''. In 1721, [[Cotton Mather]] conducted the first attempt at recording the speech of slaves in his interviews regarding the practice of smallpox inoculation.{{sfnp|Read|1939|p=247}} By the time of the American Revolution, varieties among slave creoles were not quite [[mutually intelligible]]. Dillard quotes a recollection of \"slave language\" toward the latter part of the 18th century:{{sfnp|Dillard|1972|p=??}} \"Kay, massa, you just leave me, me sit here, great fish jump up into da canoe, here he be, massa, fine fish, massa; me den very grad; den me sit very still, until another great fish jump into de canoe; but me fall asleep, massa, and no wake 'til you come....\" Not until the time of the [[American Civil War]] did the language of the slaves become familiar to a large number of educated whites. The abolitionist papers before the war form a rich [[text corpus|corpus]] of examples of plantation creole. In ''Army Life in a Black Regiment'' (1870), [[Thomas Wentworth Higginson]] detailed many features of his black soldiers' language. Opponents of the creole theory suggest that such pidgins or creoles existed but simply died out without directly contributing to modern AAVE.\n\n== Phonology ==\nMany pronunciation features distinctly set AAVE apart from other forms of [[American English]] (particularly, [[General American]]). McWhorter argues that what truly unites all AAVE accents is a uniquely wide-ranging intonation pattern or \"melody\", which characterizes even the most \"neutral\" or light African-American accent.{{sfnp|McWhorter|2001|pp=146\u20137}} A handful of multisyllabic words in AAVE differ from General American in their stress placement so that, for example, ''police'', ''guitar'', and ''Detroit'' are pronounced with initial stress instead of ultimate stress.{{sfnp|Green|2002|p=131}} The following are phonological differences in AAVE vowel and consonant sounds.\n\n===Vowels===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|+ class=\"nowrap\" | All AAVE vowels\n! colspan=\"3\" | Pure vowels ([[monophthong]]s)\n|-\n| '''[[Help:IPA for English|English diaphoneme]]'''\n| '''AAVE [[phoneme]]'''<ref>{{cite web|title=Accents of English from Around the World|editor=Heggarty, Paul |display-editors=etal |publisher=University of Edinburgh|year=2013|url=http://www.lel.ed.ac.uk/research/gsound/|postscript=See pronunciation for \"Chicago AAVE\" and \"N.Carolina AAVE.\"}}</ref>\n| '''Example words'''\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" | {{IPAc-en|\u00e6}}\n| {{IPA|[\u00e6~\u025b\u02d0~\u025b\u0259]}}\n| '''a'''ct, p'''a'''l, tr'''a'''p\n|-\n| [[\u00e6 tensing|{{IPA|[\u025b\u02d0~\u025b\u0259~e\u0259]}}]]\n| h'''a'''m, l'''a'''nd, y'''eah'''\n|-\n| {{IPAc-en|\u0251\u02d0}}\n| rowspan=\"2\" |{{IPA|[a~\u00e4~\u0251]}}\n| rowspan=\"2\" | bl'''ah''', b'''o'''ther, f'''a'''ther, <br/>l'''o'''t, t'''o'''p, w'''a'''sp\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" |{{IPAc-en|\u0252}}\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" | {{IPA|[\u0252(\u0254)~\u0254(\u028a)]}}\n| rowspan=\"2\" |'''a'''ll, d'''o'''g, b'''ough'''t, <br/>l'''o'''ss, s'''aw''', t'''augh'''t\n|-\n|{{IPAc-en|\u0254\u02d0}}\n|-\n| {{IPAc-en|\u025b}}\n| {{IPA|[\u025b~e\u0259]}}\n| dr'''e'''ss, m'''e'''t, br'''ea'''d\n|-\n| {{IPAc-en|\u0259}}\n| {{IPA|[\u0259]}}\n| '''a'''bout, syr'''u'''p, '''a'''ren'''a'''\n|-\n| {{IPAc-en|\u026a}}\n| {{IPA|[\u026a~i\u0259]}}\n| h'''i'''t, sk'''i'''m, t'''i'''p\n|-\n| {{IPAc-en|i\u02d0}}\n| {{IPA|[i]}}\n| b'''ea'''m, ch'''i'''c, fl'''ee'''t\n|-\n| {{IPAc-en|\u028c}}\n| {{IPA|[\u028c~\u025c]}}\n| b'''u'''s, fl'''oo'''d, wh'''a'''t\n|-\n| {{IPAc-en|\u028a}}\n| {{IPA|[\u028a~\u0275~\u00f8\u031e]}}\n| b'''oo'''k, p'''u'''t, sh'''ou'''ld\n|-\n| {{IPAc-en|u\u02d0}}\n| {{IPA|[\u028au~u]}}\n| f'''oo'''d, gl'''ue''', n'''ew'''\n|-\n! colspan=\"3\" | [[Diphthong]]s\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" | {{IPAc-en|a\u026a}}\n| {{IPA|[\u00e4\u02d0~\u00e4e~a\u02d0]}}\n| pr'''i'''ze, sl'''i'''de, t'''ie'''\n|-\n| [[Canadian raising|{{IPA|[\u00e4\u026a]}}]]\n| pr'''i'''ce, sl'''i'''ce, t'''y'''ke\n|-\n| {{IPAc-en|a\u028a}}\n| {{IPA|[\u00e6\u0254~\u00e6\u0259]}}\n| n'''ow''', '''ou'''ch, sc'''ou'''t\n|-\n| {{IPAc-en|e\u026a}}\n| {{IPA|[e\u026a~\u025b\u026a]}}\n| l'''a'''ke, p'''ai'''d, r'''ei'''n\n|-\n| {{IPAc-en|\u0254\u026a}}\n| {{IPA|[o\u026a]}}\n| b'''oy''', ch'''oi'''ce, m'''oi'''st\n|-\n| {{IPAc-en|o\u028a}}\n| {{IPA|[\u028c\u028a~\u0254\u028a]}}\n| g'''oa'''t, '''oh''', sh'''ow'''\n|-\n! colspan=\"3\" | [[R-colored vowel]]s\n|-\n| {{IPAc-en|\u0251r}}\n| rhotic: {{IPA|[\u0251\u0279~\u0252\u0279]}}<br/>non-rhotic: {{IPA|[\u0251~\u0252]}}\n| b'''ar'''n, c'''ar''', h'''ear'''t\n|-\n| {{IPAc-en|\u025b\u0259r}}\n| rhotic: {{IPA|[\u025b\u0279]}}<br/>non-rhotic: {{IPA|[\u025b\u0259]}}\n| b'''are''', b'''ear''', th'''ere'''\n|-\n| {{IPAc-en|\u025cr}}\n| {{IPA|[\u025d]}}\n| b'''ur'''n, f'''ir'''st, h'''er'''d\n|-\n| {{IPAc-en|\u0259r}}\n| rhotic: {{IPA|[\u025a]}}<br/>non-rhotic: {{IPA|[\u0259]}}\n| bett'''er''', mart'''yr''', doct'''or'''\n|-\n| {{IPAc-en|\u026a\u0259r}}\n| rhotic: {{IPA|[i\u0279]}}<br/>non-rhotic: {{IPA|[i\u0259~i\u0264]}}\n| f'''ear''', p'''eer''', t'''ier'''\n|-\n| {{IPAc-en|\u0254\u02d0r}}\n| rowspan=\"2\" | rhotic: {{IPA|[o\u0279]}}<br/>non-rhotic:{{IPA|[o\u0259~\u0254\u0259~\u0254o]}}\n| rowspan=\"2\" | h'''oar'''se, h'''or'''se, p'''oor''' <br/ > sc'''ore''', t'''our''', w'''ar'''\n|-\n| {{IPAc-en|\u028a\u0259r}}\n|-\n| {{IPAc-en|j|\u028a\u0259r}}\n| rhotic: {{IPA|[ju\u0279~j\u028a\u0279]}}<br/>non-rhotic:{{IPA|[ju\u0259~j\u028a\u0259]}}\n| c'''ure''', '''Eur'''ope, p'''ure'''\n|}\n*African American Vowel Shift: AAVE accents have traditionally resisted the [[cot-caught merger]] spreading nationwide, with {{sc|lot}}  pronounced {{IPA|[\u00e4]}} and {{sc|thought}} traditionally pronounced {{IPA|[\u0252\u0254]}}, though now often {{IPA|[\u0252~\u0254\u0259]}}.

''test'' is pronounced {{IPA|[t\u025bs]}} since {{IPA|/t/}} and {{IPA|/s/}} are both voiceless; ''hand'' is pronounced {{IPA|[h\u00e6n]}} (or, more narrowly {{IPA|[h\u025b\u0259n]}}), since {{IPA|/n/}} and {{IPA|/d/}} are both voiced; but ''pant'' is unchanged, as it contains both a voiced and a voiceless consonant in the cluster.{{sfnp|Rickford|1997b|p=??}} It is the plosive ({{IPA|/t/}} and {{IPA|/d/}}) in these examples that is lost rather than the fricative or nasal. Speakers may carry this declustered pronunciation when pluralizing so that the plural of test is {{IPA|[\u02c8t\u025bs\u0259s]}} rather than {{IPA|[t\u025bsts]}}.{{sfnp|Green|2002|pp=107\u2013116}} The clusters {{IPA|/ft/}}, {{IPA|/md/}}, are also affected.{{sfnp|Labov|1972|p=15}}\n** More often, word-final {{IPA|/sp/}}, {{IPA|/st/}}, and {{IPA|/sk/}} are reduced, again with the final element being deleted rather than the former.{{sfnp|Labov|1972|pp=15\u201316}}\n** For younger speakers, {{IPA|/skr/}} also occurs in words that other varieties of English have {{IPA|/str/}} so that, for example, ''street'' is pronounced {{IPA|[skrit]}}.{{sfnp|Green|2002|p=123}}\n** Clusters ending in {{IPA|/s/}} or {{IPA|/z/}} exhibit variation in whether the first or second element is deleted.{{sfnp|Labov|1972|pp=17\u201318}}\n* Similarly, final consonants may be deleted (although there is a great deal of variation between speakers in this regard). Most often, {{IPA|/t/}} and {{IPA|/d/}} are deleted. As with other dialects of English, final {{IPA|/t/}} and {{IPA|/k/}} may reduce to a [[glottal stop]]. Nasal consonants may be lost while nasalization of the vowel is retained (e.g., ''find'' may be pronounced {{IPA|[f\u00e3\u02d0]}}). More rarely, {{IPA|/s/}} and {{IPA|/z/}} may also be deleted.{{sfnp|Labov|1972|pp=18\u201319}}\n* Use of [[Phonological history of English consonant clusters#S-cluster metathesis|metathesized]] forms like ''aks'' for \"ask\"<ref>See {{Harvcoltxt|Baugh|2000|pp=92\u201394}} on \"aks\" and metathesis, on the frequency with which \"aks\" is brought up by those who ridicule AAVE (e.g.{{Harvcoltxt|Cosby|1997}}), and on the linguistic or cognitive abilities of a speaker of another variety of English who would take \"aks\" to mean \"axe\" in a context that in another variety would probably call for \"ask\".</ref> or ''graps'' for \"grasp\".\n* General [[rhotic and non-rhotic accents|non-rhotic]] behavior, in which the [[rhotic consonant]] {{IPA|/r/}} is typically dropped when not followed by a vowel; it may also manifest as an unstressed {{IPA|[\u0259]}} or the lengthening of the preceding vowel.{{sfnp|Green|2002|pp=119\u2013121}} Intervocalic {{IPA|/r/}} may also be dropped, e.g. General American ''story'' ({{IPA|[\u02c8st\u0254\u0279i]}}) can be pronounced {{IPA|[\u02c8st\u0254.i]}}, though this doesn't occur across morpheme boundaries.<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Green|2002|p=121}}, citing {{Harvcoltxt|Wolfram|Fasold|1974|p=140}}</ref> {{IPA|/r/}} may also be deleted between a consonant and a back rounded vowel, especially in words like ''throw'', ''throat'', and ''through''.{{sfnp|Labov|1972|p=14}}\n**The level of AAVE rhoticity is likely somewhat correlated with the rhoticity of white speakers in a given region; in 1960s research, AAVE accents tended to be mostly non-rhotic in Detroit, whose white speakers are rhotic, but completely non-rhotic in New York City, whose white speakers are also often non-rhotic.<ref>Wolfram, Walt; Kohn, Mary E.

In most other American English dialects, this can only be expressed unambiguously by using adverbs such as ''usually''.<ref>Aspectual ''be'': {{Harvcoltxt|Green|2002|pp=47\u201354}}</ref>\n\nThis aspect-marking form of ''been'' or BIN<ref>In order to distinguish the stressed and unstressed forms, which carry different meaning, linguists often write the stressed version as BIN</ref> is stressed and semantically distinct from the unstressed form: ''She BIN running'' ('She has been running for a long time') and ''She been running'' ('She has been running').{{sfnp|Green|2002|pp=54\u201355}}  This aspect has been given several names, including ''perfect phase'', ''remote past'', and ''remote phase'' (this article uses the third).{{sfnp|Rickford|1999|p=??}}  As shown above, ''been'' places action in the distant past. However, when ''been'' is used with [[stative verb]]s or [[gerund]] forms, ''been'' shows that the action began in the distant past and that it is continuing now. {{Harvcoltxt|Rickford|1999}} suggests that a better translation when used with stative verbs is \"for a long time\". For instance, in response to \"I like your new dress\", one might hear ''Oh, I been had this dress'', meaning that the speaker has had the dress for a long time and that it isn't new.{{sfnp|Rickford|1999|p=??}}\n\nTo see the difference between the simple past and the gerund when used with ''been'', consider the following expressions:\n: ''I been bought her clothes'' means \"I bought her clothes a long time ago\".\n: ''I been buying her clothes'' means \"I've been buying her clothes for a long time\".\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+AAVE grammatical aspects\n!Aspect\n!Example\n![[Standard English]] meaning\n|-\n| Habitual/continuative aspect<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Fickett|1972|p=17}} refers to this as a combination of \"punctuative\" and \"imperfect\" aspects.</ref>\n| He be working Tuesdays.\n| He frequently (or habitually) works on Tuesdays.\n|-\n| Intensified continuative (habitual)\n| He stay working.\n| He is always working.\n|-\n| Intensified continuative (not habitual){{sfnp|Green|2002|pp=71\u201372}}\n| He steady working.\n| He keeps on working.\n|-\n| Perfect progressive\n| He been working.\n| He has been working.\n|-\n|[[Irrealis mood|Irrealis]]<!-- Would referring to it as \"optative\" be original? -->{{clarify|reason=Irrealis is not an aspect, but rather a mood.|date=June 2017}}\n| He finna go to work.\n| He is about to go to work.{{Ref|Finna|a}}\n|}\n* {{note|Finna|a}} ''Finna'' corresponds to \"fixing to\" in other varieties.{{sfnp|Green|2002|p=71}} it is also written ''fixina'', ''fixna'', ''fitna'', and ''finta''<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Green|2002|pp=70\u201371}}, citing {{Harvcoltxt|DeBose|Faraclas|1993}}.</ref>\nIn addition to these, ''come'' (which may or may not be an auxiliary<ref>See {{Harvcoltxt|Spears|1982|p=850}}</ref>) may be used to indicate speaker indignation, such as in ''Don't come acting like you don't know what happened and you started the whole thing'' ('Don't try to act as if you don't know what happened, because you started the whole thing').{{sfnp|Green|2002|pp=73\u201374}}\n\n=== Negation ===\nNegatives are formed differently from most other varieties of English:{{sfnp|Howe|Walker|2000|p=110}}\n* Use of ''[[ain't]]'' as a general negative indicator. As in other dialects, it can be used where most other dialects would use ''am not'', ''isn't'', ''aren't'', ''haven't'', and ''hasn't.'' However, in marked contrast to other varieties of English in the US, some speakers of AAVE also use ''ain't'' instead of ''don't'', ''doesn't'', or ''didn't'' (''e.g.'', ''I ain't know that'').{{sfnp|Labov|1972|p=284}} ''Ain't'' had its origins in common English but became increasingly stigmatized since the 19th century. See also ''[[amn't]]''.\n* Negative concord, popularly called \"double negation\", as in ''I didn't go nowhere''; if the sentence is negative, all negatable forms are negated. This contrasts with [[standard written English]] conventions, which have traditionally prescribed that a double negative is considered incorrect to mean anything other than a positive (although this was not always so; see [[double negative]]).\n* In a negative construction, an indefinite pronoun such as ''nobody'' or ''nothing'' can be inverted with the negative verb particle for emphasis (e.g., ''Don't nobody know the answer'', ''Ain't nothing going on''.)\n\nWhile AAVE shares these with Creole languages,{{sfnp|Winford|1992|p=350}} {{Harvcoltxt|Howe|Walker|2000}} use data from early recordings of African Nova Scotian English, Saman\u00e1 English, and the recordings of former slaves to demonstrate that negation was inherited from nonstandard colonial English.{{sfnp|Howe|Walker|2000|p=110}}\n\n=== Other grammatical characteristics ===\n* The [[copula (linguistics)|copula]] ''be'' in the present tense is often [[zero copula|dropped]], as in [[Russian language|Russian]], [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]], [[Arabic language|Arabic]] and other languages. For example: ''You crazy'' (\"You're crazy\") or ''She my sister'' (\"She's my sister\"). The phenomenon is also observed in questions: ''Who you?'' (\"Who're you?\") and ''Where you at?'' (\"Where are you (at)?\"). This has been sometimes considered a Southern U.S. regionalism, though it is most frequent in black speech.{{sfnp|Labov|1972|p=8}} On the other hand, a stressed ''is'' cannot be dropped: ''Yes, she ''is'' my sister''.  The general rules are:\n** Only the forms ''is'' and ''are'' (of which the latter is anyway often replaced by ''is'') can be omitted; ''am'', ''was'', and ''were'' are not deleted.\n** These forms cannot be omitted when they would be pronounced with stress in General American (whether or not the stress serves specifically to impart an emphatic sense to the verb's meaning).\n** These forms cannot be omitted when the corresponding form in standard English cannot show contraction (and vice versa). For example, ''I don't know where he is'' cannot be reduced to <!-- The asterisk is standard linguistics notation for \"unacceptable\"; please don't remove it. -->*''I don't know where he'' just as in standard English forms the corresponding reduction <!-- See the note on the preceding asterisk. -->*''I don't know where he's'' is likewise impossible. (''I don't know where he at'' is possible, paralleling ''I don't know where he's at'' in standard English.)\n** Possibly some other minor conditions apply as well.<ref>{{cite web\n|url=http://www.abc.net.au/radionational/programs/linguafranca/why-ebonics-is-no-joke/3521084\n|title=Why Ebonics Is No Joke.\n|work=Lingua Franca\n|type=transcript\n|author=[[Geoffrey Pullum|Geoff Pullum]]\n|date=17 October 1998\n|access-date=1 May 2014\n|publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation\n|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20100209091550/http://www.abc.net.au/rn/arts/ling/stories/lf981017.htm |archive-date=9 February 2010 |url-status= live}}</ref>\n* Verbs are uninflected for number and person: there is no ''-s'' ending in the present-tense third-person singular. Example: ''She write poetry'' (\"She writes poetry\"). AAVE ''don't'' for standard English ''doesn't'' comes from this, unlike in some other dialects which use ''don't'' for standard English ''doesn't'' but ''does'' when not in the negative. Similarly, ''was'' is used for what in standard English are contexts for both ''was'' and ''were.''{{sfnp|Green|2002|p=38}}\n* The genitive -'s ending may or may not be used.{{sfnp|Green|2002|pp=102\u2013103}} Genitive case is inferrable from adjacency. This is similar to many creoles throughout the [[Caribbean]]. Many language forms throughout the world use an unmarked possessive; it may here result from a simplification of grammatical structures. Example: ''my momma sister'' (\"my mother's sister\")\n* The words ''it'' and ''they'' denote the existence of something, equivalent to standard English's ''there is'' or ''there are''.{{sfnp|Green|2002|p=80}}\n* Word order in questions: ''Why they ain't growing?'' (\"Why aren't they growing?\") and ''Who the hell she think she is?'' (\"Who the hell does she think she is?\") lack the inversion of most other forms of English. Because of this, there is also no need for the \"[[Do-support|auxiliary ''do'']]\".{{sfnp|Green|2002|pp=84\u201389}}\n* Usage of personal pronoun \"them\" instead of definite article \"those\" or \"these\".{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}\n\n== Vocabulary ==\nAAVE shares most of its lexicon with other varieties of English, particularly that of informal and [[Southern American English|Southern]] dialects; for example, the relatively recent use of ''[[y'all]]''. However, it has also been suggested that some of the vocabulary unique to AAVE has its origin in West African languages, but etymology is often difficult to trace and without a trail of recorded usage, the suggestions below cannot be considered proven. Early AAVE and Gullah contributed a number of African-originated words to the American English mainstream, including ''gumbo'',<ref>''Shorter OED,'' 5th edition, cf [[Bantu languages|Bantu]] ''kingumbo''</ref> ''goober'',<ref>''Shorter OED,'' 5th edition, [[Kikongo]] ''nguba''</ref> ''yam'', and ''banjo''.<ref>Nagle, S., & Sanders, S. (Eds.). (2003). English in the Southern United States (Studies in English Language). Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. p. 12.</ref>\n\nAAVE has also contributed slang expressions such as ''cool'' and ''hip''.{{sfnp|Guralnik|1984|p=?}} In many cases, the postulated etymologies are not recognized by linguists or the [[Oxford English Dictionary]], such as ''to dig'',<ref>This is from [[Wolof language|Wolof]] ''d\u00ebgg'' or ''d\u00ebgga'', meaning \"to understand/appreciate\" according to Smitherman 2000 s.v. \"Dig\"; or, it may instead come from [[Irish language|Irish]] ''[[wikt:tuig|tuig]]'', according to Random House Unabridged, 2001</ref> ''jazz'',{{sfnp|Rickford|Rickford|2000|p=146}}<!--citing one or more of \"David Dalby, Joseph Holloway, and Winifred Vass, among others\"; this should be checked--> ''tote'',{{sfnp|Rickford|Rickford|2000|p=146}} and ''bad-mouth'', a [[calque]] from [[Mandinka language|Mandinka]].<ref>{{harvcoltxt|Smitherman|1977|p=??}} cited in Rickford and Rickford, ''Spoken Soul,'' 240.<!-- who unfortunately don't give a page number for Smitherman or more detail of the allegedly Mandingo origin; must check for details. --></ref>\n\nAAVE also has words that either are not part of most other American English dialects or have strikingly different meanings. For example, there are several words in AAVE referring to white people that are not part of mainstream American English; these include ''gray'' as an adjective for whites (as in ''gray dude''), possibly from the color of [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] uniforms; and ''paddy'', an extension of the slang use for \"Irish\".<ref>''Gray'': Smitherman, ''Black Talk, s.v.'' \"Gray\". ''Paddy'': ''Dictionary of American Regional English, s.v.'' \"Paddy\".</ref>\n\n\"[[wikt:ofay|Ofay]],\" which is [[pejorative]], is another general term for a [[White people|white person]]; it might derive from the [[Ibibio language|Ibibio]] word ''afia'', which means \"light-colored\", from the [[Yoruba language|Yoruba]] word ''ofe'', spoken in hopes of disappearing from danger, or via [[Pig Latin]] from \"foe\". However, most dictionaries simply say its etymology is unknown.<ref>{{harvcoltxt|Smitherman|2000}} suggests either a general West African or the Pig Latin origin. ''Black Talk'', s.v. \"Ofay\".</ref>\n\n''Kitchen'' refers to the particularly curly or kinky hair at the nape of the neck, and ''siditty'' or ''seddity'' means \"snobbish\" or \"bourgeois\".<ref>{{harvcoltxt|Smitherman|2000}}, s.v.'' \"Kitchen\". ''Kitchen, siditty'': ''Dictionary of American Regional English'', s.vv. \"Kitchen\", \"Siditty\".</ref>\n\nAAVE has also contributed various words and phrases to other varieties of English, including ''chill out'', ''main squeeze'', ''soul'', ''funky'', and ''threads''.{{sfnp|Lee|1999|pp=381\u2013386}}\n\n==Influence on other dialects==\nAfrican-American Vernacular English has influenced the development of other dialects of English. The AAVE accent, [[New York accent]], and Spanish-language accents have together yielded the sound of [[New York Latino English]], some of whose speakers use an accent indistinguishable from an AAVE one.{{sfnp|Blake|Shousterman|Newlin-\u0141ukowicz|2015|pp=284-285}} AAVE has also influenced certain [[Chicano English|Chicano accents]] and [[Liberian English|Liberian Settler English]], directly derived from the AAVE of the original 16,000 African Americans who migrated to Liberia in the 1800s.<ref>Singler, John Victor (2004).

Berlin: Mouton de Gruyter. p. 335-336.</ref> Using the word ''bees'' even in place of ''be'' to mean ''is'' or ''are'' in standard English, as in the sentence \"That's the way it bees\" is also one of the rarest of all deep AAVE features today, and most middle-class AAVE speakers would recognize the verb ''bees'' as part of only a deep \"Southern\" or \"country\" speaker's vocabulary.{{sfnp|McWhorter|2001|pp=146\u20137}}\n\n===Local variations===\nNew York City AAVE incorporates some local features of the [[New York accent]], including its high {{Sc|thought}} vowel; meanwhile, conversely, Pittsburgh AAVE may merge this same vowel with the {{sc|lot}} vowel, matching the [[cot-caught merger]] of [[Western Pennsylvania English|white Pittsburgh accents]]. AAVE accents traditionally do not have the cot-caught merger. [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]], [[Atlanta]], and [[Research Triangle]] AAVE incorporates the {{sc|dress}} vowel raising and {{sc|face}} vowel lowering associated with [[Southern American English|white Southern accents]]. Memphis and St. Louis AAVE are developing, since the mid-twentieth century, an iconic [[Square-nurse merger|merger of the vowels in {{sc|square}} and {{sc|nurse}}]], making ''there'' sound like ''thurr''.<ref>Wolfram, Walt; Kohn, Mary E.

There is near-uniformity of AAVE grammar, despite its vast geographic spread across the whole country.{{sfnp|Labov|2001|pp=506\u2013508}} This may be due in part to relatively recent migrations of African Americans out of the [[Southern United States|American South]] (see [[Great Migration (African American)|Great Migration]] and [[Second Great Migration (African American)|Second Great Migration]]) as well as to long-term racial segregation that kept black people living together in largely homogeneous communities.{{sfnp|Wardhaugh|2002|p=339}}\n\nMisconceptions about AAVE are, and have long been, common, and have stigmatized its use. One myth is that AAVE is grammatically \"simple\" or \"sloppy\".

Generally speaking, the degree of exclusive use of AAVE decreases with increasing [[socioeconomic status]] (although AAVE is still used by even well-educated African Americans).{{sfnp|Coulmas|2005|p=177}}{{sfnp|Rickford|Rickford|2000|p=8}}{{sfnp|DeBose|1992|p=159}}{{sfnp|Linnes|1998}}\n\nAnother myth is that AAVE is the native dialect (or even more inaccurately, a linguistic fad) employed by all African Americans. Wheeler (1999) warns that \"AAVE should not be thought of as the language of Black people in America. Many African Americans neither speak it nor know much about it\".{{sfnp|Wheeler|1999|p=55}}\n\n{{Harvcoltxt|Ogbu|1999}} argues that the use of AAVE carries racially affirmative political undertones as its use allows African Americans to assert their cultural upbringing.  Nevertheless, use of AAVE also carries strong social connotations; {{Harvcoltxt|Sweetland|2002}} presents a white female speaker of AAVE who is accepted as a member into African American social groups despite her race.\n\nBefore the substantial research of the 1960s and 1970s\u2014including [[William Labov]]'s groundbreakingly thorough grammatical study, ''Language in the Inner City''\u2014there was doubt that the speech of African Americans had any exclusive features not found in varieties spoken by other groups; {{Harvcoltxt|Williamson|1970}} noted that distinctive features of African American speech were present in the speech of Southerners and {{Harvcoltxt|Farrison|1970}} argued that there were really no substantial vocabulary or grammatical differences between the speech of blacks and that of other English dialects.<ref>Cited in {{Harvcoltxt|Green|2002|p=218}}</ref>\n\n=== In the legal system ===\n\nThe United States courts are divided over how to admit statements of ambiguous tense made in AAVE under evidence. In ''United States v. Arnold'', the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit]] held that \"he [[:wikt:finna#English|finna]] shoot me\" was a statement made in the [[present tense]], so it was admissible [[hearsay]] under the [[excited utterance]] exception; however, the dissent held that past or present tense could not be determined by the statement, so the statement should not have been admitted into evidence.<ref>''U.S. v. Arnold'', 486 F.3d 177 (2007) http://www.ca6.uscourts.gov/opinions.pdf/07a0181p-06.pdf Retrieved on Sept 23, 2013.</ref>\n\nIn US courts, an interpreter is only routinely available for speakers of \"a language other than English\". Rickford and King (2016) argue that a lack of familiarity with AAVE (and other minority dialects of English) on the part of jurors, stenographers, and others can lead to misunderstandings in court. They especially focus on the [[Shooting of Trayvon Martin|Trayvon Martin case]] and how the testimony of Rachel Jeantel was perceived as incomprehensible and not credible by the jury due to her dialect.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Rickford|first=John R.|last2=King|first2=Sharese|date=2016-12-20|title=Language and linguistics on trial: Hearing Rachel Jeantel (and other vernacular speakers) in the courtroom and beyond|url=https://cpb-us-west-2-juc1ugur1qwqqqo4.stackpathdns.com/blog.nus.edu.sg/dist/d/3920/files/2017/01/RickfordKing_2016-2889rsv.pdf|journal=Language|language=en|volume=92|issue=4|pages=948\u2013988|doi=10.1353/lan.2016.0078|issn=1535-0665}}</ref>\n\n=== In music ===\n[[spiritual (music)|Spirituals]], [[blues]], [[jazz]], [[R&B]], and most recently, [[hip-hop music|hip-hop]] are all genres associated with [[African American music]]; as such, AAVE usually appears, through singing, speaking, or rapping, in these musical forms. Examples of morphosyntactic features of AAVE in genres other than hip-hop are given below:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Artist\n! Song\n! Lyric\n! AAVE feature\n|-\n| [[Nina Simone]]\n| \"It Be's That Way Sometime\"\n| \"It Be's That Way Sometime\"\n| habitual aspect with ''be''\n|-\n| [[Vera Hall]]\n| \"Trouble So Hard\"\n| \"Don't nobody know my trouble but God\"\n| negative concord\n|-\n| [[Texas Alexander]]\n| \"The Rising Sun\"\n| \"She got something round and it look just like a bat\"\n| lack of inflection on present-tense verb\n|-\n| [[WC Handy]]\n| \"[[Saint Louis Blues (song)|Saint Louis Blues]]\"\n| \"Cause my baby, he done left this town.\"\n| Use of \"done\" to indicate the recent past\n|}\n\nMore recently, AAVE has been used heavily in hip-hop to show \"[[street cred]]\".{{sfnp|Chesley|2011}} Examples of morphosyntactic AAVE features used by black hip-hop artists are given below:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Artist\n! Song\n! Lyric\n! AAVE feature\n|-\n| [[LL Cool J]]\n| \"[[Control Myself]]\"\n| \"She said her name Shayeeda\"\n| [[zero copula|absence of copula]]\n|-\n| [[LL Cool J]]\n| \"[[Control Myself]]\"\n| \"I could tell her mama feed her\"\n| lack of inflection on present-tense verb\n|-\n| [[Kanye West]] ft.

However, they tend to avoid the term ''[[nigga]]'', even as a marker of solidarity.{{sfnp|Cutler|2007}} White hip-hop artists such as Eyedea can choose to accentuate their whiteness by hyper-articulating postvocalic ''r'' sounds (i.e. the [[retroflex approximant]]).{{sfnp|Cutler|2007}}\n\nAAVE is also used by non-black artists in genres other than hip-hop, if less frequently. For instance, in \"[[Tonight Tonight (Hot Chelle Rae song)|Tonight, Tonight]]\", [[Hot Chelle Rae]] uses the term ''dime'' to mean \"an attractive woman\".{{sfnp|Smitherman|2000|p=108}} [[Jewel (singer)|Jewel]]'s \"Sometimes It Be That Way\" employs habitual ''be'' in the title to indicate [[habitual aspect]]. If they do not employ similar features of AAVE in their speech, then it can be argued that they are modeling their musical performance to evoke aspects of particular musical genres such as R&B or the blues (as British pop musicians of the 1960s and beyond did to evoke rock, pop, and the blues).{{sfnp|Trudgill|1983}} Some research suggests that non-African American young adults learn AAVE vocabulary by listening to hip-hop music.{{sfnp|Chesley|2011}}\n\n=== In social media ===\n\nOn Twitter, AAVE is used as a framework from which sentences and words are constructed, in order to accurately express oneself. {{sfnp|Florini|2014|p=233}} Grammatical features and word pronunciations stemming from AAVE are preserved. {{sfnp|Florini|2014|p=233}} Spellings based on AAVE have become increasingly common, to the point where it has become a normalized practice. Some examples include, \"you\" (you're), \"they\" (their/they're), \"gon/gone\" (going to), and \"yo\" (your). {{sfnp|Florini|2014|p=233}}\n\n=== In education ===\n{{main|African-American Vernacular English and education}}\nEducators traditionally have attempted to eliminate AAVE usage through the public education system, perceiving the dialect as grammatically defective.{{sfnp|Wardhaugh|2002|pp=343\u2013348}} In 1974, the teacher-led [[Conference on College Composition and Communication]] issued a position statement affirming students' rights to their own dialects and the validity of all dialects.{{sfnp|Smitherman|1999|p=357}} Mainstream linguistics has long agreed with this view about dialects.{{sfnp|McWhorter|2001}} In 1979, a judge ordered the Ann Arbor School District to find a way to identify AAVE speakers in the schools and to \"use that knowledge in teaching such students how to read standard English.\"<ref>Flood, J., Jensen, J., Lapp, D., Squire, J. (1991). ''Handbook of research on teaching the English language arts''. New York, NY: Macmillan Publishing Company.</ref> In 1996, [[Oakland Unified School District]] made a [[Oakland Ebonics resolution|controversial resolution]] for AAVE, which was later called \"Ebonics.\" The Oakland School board approved that Ebonics be recognized as a language independent from English (though this particular view is not endorsed by linguists), that teachers would participate in recognizing this language, and that it would be used in theory to support the transition from Ebonics to Standard American English in schools.

In the early 2000s, [[Shana Poplack]] provided [[corpus linguistics|corpus]]-based evidence{{sfnp|Poplack|2000|p=?}}{{sfnp|Poplack|Tagliamonte|2001|p=?}}\u2014evidence from a body of writing\u2014from isolated enclaves in [[Saman\u00e1 Peninsula|Saman\u00e1]] and [[African Nova Scotian English|Nova Scotia]] peopled by descendants of migrations of early AAVE-speaking groups (see [[Saman\u00e1 English]]) that suggests that the grammar of early AAVE was closer to that of contemporary British dialects than modern urban AAVE is to other current American dialects, suggesting that the modern language is a result of divergence from mainstream varieties, rather than the result of decreolization from a widespread American creole.<ref>William Labov, in the Foreword to {{Harvcoltxt|Poplack|Tagliamonte|2001}}, says \"I would like to think that this clear demonstration of the similarities among the three diaspora dialects and the White benchmark dialects, combined with their differences from creole grammars, would close at least one chapter in the history of the creole controversies.\"</ref>\n\nLinguist [[John McWhorter]] maintains that the contribution of West African languages to AAVE is minimal. In an interview on [[National Public Radio]]'s ''Talk of the Nation'', McWhorter characterized AAVE as a \"hybrid of regional dialects of Great Britain that slaves in America were exposed to because they often worked alongside the indentured servants who spoke those dialects...\" According to McWhorter, virtually all linguists who have carefully studied the origins of AAVE \"agree that the West African connection is quite minor.\"<ref>Ludden, Jennifer (September 6, 2010). [https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=129682981 \"Op-Ed: DEA Call For Ebonics Experts Smart Move\"]. [[NPR]].</ref>\n\nHowever, a creole theory, less accepted among linguists, posits that AAVE arose from one or more [[creole language]]s used by African captives of the [[Atlantic slave trade]], due to the captives speaking many different native languages and therefore needing a new way to communicate among themselves and with their captors.{{sfnp|Wolfram|1998|p=112}}  According to this theory, these captives first developed what are called [[pidgin]]s: simplified mixtures of languages. Since pidgins form from close contact between speakers of different languages, the slave trade would have been exactly such a situation. Creolist John Dillard quotes, for example, [[slave ship]] captain William Smith describing the sheer diversity of mutually unintelligible languages just in [[The Gambia]].{{sfnp|Dillard|1972|p=??}} By 1715, an African pidgin was reproduced in novels by [[Daniel Defoe]], in particular, ''The Life of Colonel Jacque''. In 1721, [[Cotton Mather]] conducted the first attempt at recording the speech of slaves in his interviews regarding the practice of smallpox inoculation.{{sfnp|Read|1939|p=247}} By the time of the American Revolution, varieties among slave creoles were not quite [[mutually intelligible]]. Dillard quotes a recollection of \"slave language\" toward the latter part of the 18th century:{{sfnp|Dillard|1972|p=??}} \"Kay, massa, you just leave me, me sit here, great fish jump up into da canoe, here he be, massa, fine fish, massa; me den very grad; den me sit very still, until another great fish jump into de canoe; but me fall asleep, massa, and no wake 'til you come....\" Not until the time of the [[American Civil War]] did the language of the slaves become familiar to a large number of educated whites. The abolitionist papers before the war form a rich [[text corpus|corpus]] of examples of plantation creole. In ''Army Life in a Black Regiment'' (1870), [[Thomas Wentworth Higginson]] detailed many features of his black soldiers' language. Opponents of the creole theory suggest that such pidgins or creoles existed but simply died out without directly contributing to modern AAVE.\n\n== Phonology ==\nMany pronunciation features distinctly set AAVE apart from other forms of [[American English]] (particularly, [[General American]]). McWhorter argues that what truly unites all AAVE accents is a uniquely wide-ranging intonation pattern or \"melody\", which characterizes even the most \"neutral\" or light African-American accent.{{sfnp|McWhorter|2001|pp=146\u20137}} A handful of multisyllabic words in AAVE differ from General American in their stress placement so that, for example, ''police'', ''guitar'', and ''Detroit'' are pronounced with initial stress instead of ultimate stress.{{sfnp|Green|2002|p=131}} The following are phonological differences in AAVE vowel and consonant sounds.\n\n===Vowels===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|+ class=\"nowrap\" | All AAVE vowels\n! colspan=\"3\" | Pure vowels ([[monophthong]]s)\n|-\n| '''[[Help:IPA for English|English diaphoneme]]'''\n| '''AAVE [[phoneme]]'''<ref>{{cite web|title=Accents of English from Around the World|editor=Heggarty, Paul |display-editors=etal |publisher=University of Edinburgh|year=2013|url=http://www.lel.ed.ac.uk/research/gsound/|postscript=See pronunciation for \"Chicago AAVE\" and \"N.Carolina AAVE.\"}}</ref>\n| '''Example words'''\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" | {{IPAc-en|\u00e6}}\n| {{IPA|[\u00e6~\u025b\u02d0~\u025b\u0259]}}\n| '''a'''ct, p'''a'''l, tr'''a'''p\n|-\n| [[\u00e6 tensing|{{IPA|[\u025b\u02d0~\u025b\u0259~e\u0259]}}]]\n| h'''a'''m, l'''a'''nd, y'''eah'''\n|-\n| {{IPAc-en|\u0251\u02d0}}\n| rowspan=\"2\" |{{IPA|[a~\u00e4~\u0251]}}\n| rowspan=\"2\" | bl'''ah''', b'''o'''ther, f'''a'''ther, <br/>l'''o'''t, t'''o'''p, w'''a'''sp\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" |{{IPAc-en|\u0252}}\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" | {{IPA|[\u0252(\u0254)~\u0254(\u028a)]}}\n| rowspan=\"2\" |'''a'''ll, d'''o'''g, b'''ough'''t, <br/>l'''o'''ss, s'''aw''', t'''augh'''t\n|-\n|{{IPAc-en|\u0254\u02d0}}\n|-\n| {{IPAc-en|\u025b}}\n| {{IPA|[\u025b~e\u0259]}}\n| dr'''e'''ss, m'''e'''t, br'''ea'''d\n|-\n| {{IPAc-en|\u0259}}\n| {{IPA|[\u0259]}}\n| '''a'''bout, syr'''u'''p, '''a'''ren'''a'''\n|-\n| {{IPAc-en|\u026a}}\n| {{IPA|[\u026a~i\u0259]}}\n| h'''i'''t, sk'''i'''m, t'''i'''p\n|-\n| {{IPAc-en|i\u02d0}}\n| {{IPA|[i]}}\n| b'''ea'''m, ch'''i'''c, fl'''ee'''t\n|-\n| {{IPAc-en|\u028c}}\n| {{IPA|[\u028c~\u025c]}}\n| b'''u'''s, fl'''oo'''d, wh'''a'''t\n|-\n| {{IPAc-en|\u028a}}\n| {{IPA|[\u028a~\u0275~\u00f8\u031e]}}\n| b'''oo'''k, p'''u'''t, sh'''ou'''ld\n|-\n| {{IPAc-en|u\u02d0}}\n| {{IPA|[\u028au~u]}}\n| f'''oo'''d, gl'''ue''', n'''ew'''\n|-\n! colspan=\"3\" | [[Diphthong]]s\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" | {{IPAc-en|a\u026a}}\n| {{IPA|[\u00e4\u02d0~\u00e4e~a\u02d0]}}\n| pr'''i'''ze, sl'''i'''de, t'''ie'''\n|-\n| [[Canadian raising|{{IPA|[\u00e4\u026a]}}]]\n| pr'''i'''ce, sl'''i'''ce, t'''y'''ke\n|-\n| {{IPAc-en|a\u028a}}\n| {{IPA|[\u00e6\u0254~\u00e6\u0259]}}\n| n'''ow''', '''ou'''ch, sc'''ou'''t\n|-\n| {{IPAc-en|e\u026a}}\n| {{IPA|[e\u026a~\u025b\u026a]}}\n| l'''a'''ke, p'''ai'''d, r'''ei'''n\n|-\n| {{IPAc-en|\u0254\u026a}}\n| {{IPA|[o\u026a]}}\n| b'''oy''', ch'''oi'''ce, m'''oi'''st\n|-\n| {{IPAc-en|o\u028a}}\n| {{IPA|[\u028c\u028a~\u0254\u028a]}}\n| g'''oa'''t, '''oh''', sh'''ow'''\n|-\n! colspan=\"3\" | [[R-colored vowel]]s\n|-\n| {{IPAc-en|\u0251r}}\n| rhotic: {{IPA|[\u0251\u0279~\u0252\u0279]}}<br/>non-rhotic: {{IPA|[\u0251~\u0252]}}\n| b'''ar'''n, c'''ar''', h'''ear'''t\n|-\n| {{IPAc-en|\u025b\u0259r}}\n| rhotic: {{IPA|[\u025b\u0279]}}<br/>non-rhotic: {{IPA|[\u025b\u0259]}}\n| b'''are''', b'''ear''', th'''ere'''\n|-\n| {{IPAc-en|\u025cr}}\n| {{IPA|[\u025d]}}\n| b'''ur'''n, f'''ir'''st, h'''er'''d\n|-\n| {{IPAc-en|\u0259r}}\n| rhotic: {{IPA|[\u025a]}}<br/>non-rhotic: {{IPA|[\u0259]}}\n| bett'''er''', mart'''yr''', doct'''or'''\n|-\n| {{IPAc-en|\u026a\u0259r}}\n| rhotic: {{IPA|[i\u0279]}}<br/>non-rhotic: {{IPA|[i\u0259~i\u0264]}}\n| f'''ear''', p'''eer''', t'''ier'''\n|-\n| {{IPAc-en|\u0254\u02d0r}}\n| rowspan=\"2\" | rhotic: {{IPA|[o\u0279]}}<br/>non-rhotic:{{IPA|[o\u0259~\u0254\u0259~\u0254o]}}\n| rowspan=\"2\" | h'''oar'''se, h'''or'''se, p'''oor''' <br/ > sc'''ore''', t'''our''', w'''ar'''\n|-\n| {{IPAc-en|\u028a\u0259r}}\n|-\n| {{IPAc-en|j|\u028a\u0259r}}\n| rhotic: {{IPA|[ju\u0279~j\u028a\u0279]}}<br/>non-rhotic:{{IPA|[ju\u0259~j\u028a\u0259]}}\n| c'''ure''', '''Eur'''ope, p'''ure'''\n|}\n*African American Vowel Shift: AAVE accents have traditionally resisted the [[cot-caught merger]] spreading nationwide, with {{sc|lot}}  pronounced {{IPA|[\u00e4]}} and {{sc|thought}} traditionally pronounced {{IPA|[\u0252\u0254]}}, though now often {{IPA|[\u0252~\u0254\u0259]}}.

There are several phenomena that are similar but are governed by different grammatical rules.  This tendency has been used by creolists to compare AAVE to West African languages since such languages do not have final clusters.{{sfnp|Green|2002|p=107}}\n** Final consonant clusters that are [[homorganic]]  (have the same [[place of articulation]]) and share the same [[voice (phonetics)|voicing]] are reduced.

Most often, {{IPA|/t/}} and {{IPA|/d/}} are deleted. As with other dialects of English, final {{IPA|/t/}} and {{IPA|/k/}} may reduce to a [[glottal stop]]. Nasal consonants may be lost while nasalization of the vowel is retained (e.g., ''find'' may be pronounced {{IPA|[f\u00e3\u02d0]}}).

In most other American English dialects, this can only be expressed unambiguously by using adverbs such as ''usually''.<ref>Aspectual ''be'': {{Harvcoltxt|Green|2002|pp=47\u201354}}</ref>\n\nThis aspect-marking form of ''been'' or BIN<ref>In order to distinguish the stressed and unstressed forms, which carry different meaning, linguists often write the stressed version as BIN</ref> is stressed and semantically distinct from the unstressed form: ''She BIN running'' ('She has been running for a long time') and ''She been running'' ('She has been running').{{sfnp|Green|2002|pp=54\u201355}}  This aspect has been given several names, including ''perfect phase'', ''remote past'', and ''remote phase'' (this article uses the third).{{sfnp|Rickford|1999|p=??}}  As shown above, ''been'' places action in the distant past. However, when ''been'' is used with [[stative verb]]s or [[gerund]] forms, ''been'' shows that the action began in the distant past and that it is continuing now. {{Harvcoltxt|Rickford|1999}} suggests that a better translation when used with stative verbs is \"for a long time\". For instance, in response to \"I like your new dress\", one might hear ''Oh, I been had this dress'', meaning that the speaker has had the dress for a long time and that it isn't new.{{sfnp|Rickford|1999|p=??}}\n\nTo see the difference between the simple past and the gerund when used with ''been'', consider the following expressions:\n: ''I been bought her clothes'' means \"I bought her clothes a long time ago\".\n: ''I been buying her clothes'' means \"I've been buying her clothes for a long time\".\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+AAVE grammatical aspects\n!Aspect\n!Example\n![[Standard English]] meaning\n|-\n| Habitual/continuative aspect<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Fickett|1972|p=17}} refers to this as a combination of \"punctuative\" and \"imperfect\" aspects.</ref>\n| He be working Tuesdays.\n| He frequently (or habitually) works on Tuesdays.\n|-\n| Intensified continuative (habitual)\n| He stay working.\n| He is always working.\n|-\n| Intensified continuative (not habitual){{sfnp|Green|2002|pp=71\u201372}}\n| He steady working.\n| He keeps on working.\n|-\n| Perfect progressive\n| He been working.\n| He has been working.\n|-\n|[[Irrealis mood|Irrealis]]<!-- Would referring to it as \"optative\" be original? -->{{clarify|reason=Irrealis is not an aspect, but rather a mood.|date=June 2017}}\n| He finna go to work.\n| He is about to go to work.{{Ref|Finna|a}}\n|}\n* {{note|Finna|a}} ''Finna'' corresponds to \"fixing to\" in other varieties.{{sfnp|Green|2002|p=71}} it is also written ''fixina'', ''fixna'', ''fitna'', and ''finta''<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Green|2002|pp=70\u201371}}, citing {{Harvcoltxt|DeBose|Faraclas|1993}}.</ref>\nIn addition to these, ''come'' (which may or may not be an auxiliary<ref>See {{Harvcoltxt|Spears|1982|p=850}}</ref>) may be used to indicate speaker indignation, such as in ''Don't come acting like you don't know what happened and you started the whole thing'' ('Don't try to act as if you don't know what happened, because you started the whole thing').{{sfnp|Green|2002|pp=73\u201374}}\n\n=== Negation ===\nNegatives are formed differently from most other varieties of English:{{sfnp|Howe|Walker|2000|p=110}}\n* Use of ''[[ain't]]'' as a general negative indicator. As in other dialects, it can be used where most other dialects would use ''am not'', ''isn't'', ''aren't'', ''haven't'', and ''hasn't.'' However, in marked contrast to other varieties of English in the US, some speakers of AAVE also use ''ain't'' instead of ''don't'', ''doesn't'', or ''didn't'' (''e.g.'', ''I ain't know that'').{{sfnp|Labov|1972|p=284}} ''Ain't'' had its origins in common English but became increasingly stigmatized since the 19th century. See also ''[[amn't]]''.\n* Negative concord, popularly called \"double negation\", as in ''I didn't go nowhere''; if the sentence is negative, all negatable forms are negated. This contrasts with [[standard written English]] conventions, which have traditionally prescribed that a double negative is considered incorrect to mean anything other than a positive (although this was not always so; see [[double negative]]).\n* In a negative construction, an indefinite pronoun such as ''nobody'' or ''nothing'' can be inverted with the negative verb particle for emphasis (e.g., ''Don't nobody know the answer'', ''Ain't nothing going on''.)\n\nWhile AAVE shares these with Creole languages,{{sfnp|Winford|1992|p=350}} {{Harvcoltxt|Howe|Walker|2000}} use data from early recordings of African Nova Scotian English, Saman\u00e1 English, and the recordings of former slaves to demonstrate that negation was inherited from nonstandard colonial English.{{sfnp|Howe|Walker|2000|p=110}}\n\n=== Other grammatical characteristics ===\n* The [[copula (linguistics)|copula]] ''be'' in the present tense is often [[zero copula|dropped]], as in [[Russian language|Russian]], [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]], [[Arabic language|Arabic]] and other languages. For example: ''You crazy'' (\"You're crazy\") or ''She my sister'' (\"She's my sister\"). The phenomenon is also observed in questions: ''Who you?'' (\"Who're you?\") and ''Where you at?'' (\"Where are you (at)?\"). This has been sometimes considered a Southern U.S. regionalism, though it is most frequent in black speech.{{sfnp|Labov|1972|p=8}} On the other hand, a stressed ''is'' cannot be dropped: ''Yes, she ''is'' my sister''.  The general rules are:\n** Only the forms ''is'' and ''are'' (of which the latter is anyway often replaced by ''is'') can be omitted; ''am'', ''was'', and ''were'' are not deleted.\n** These forms cannot be omitted when they would be pronounced with stress in General American (whether or not the stress serves specifically to impart an emphatic sense to the verb's meaning).\n** These forms cannot be omitted when the corresponding form in standard English cannot show contraction (and vice versa). For example, ''I don't know where he is'' cannot be reduced to <!-- The asterisk is standard linguistics notation for \"unacceptable\"; please don't remove it. -->*''I don't know where he'' just as in standard English forms the corresponding reduction <!-- See the note on the preceding asterisk. -->*''I don't know where he's'' is likewise impossible. (''I don't know where he at'' is possible, paralleling ''I don't know where he's at'' in standard English.)\n** Possibly some other minor conditions apply as well.<ref>{{cite web\n|url=http://www.abc.net.au/radionational/programs/linguafranca/why-ebonics-is-no-joke/3521084\n|title=Why Ebonics Is No Joke.\n|work=Lingua Franca\n|type=transcript\n|author=[[Geoffrey Pullum|Geoff Pullum]]\n|date=17 October 1998\n|access-date=1 May 2014\n|publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation\n|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20100209091550/http://www.abc.net.au/rn/arts/ling/stories/lf981017.htm |archive-date=9 February 2010 |url-status= live}}</ref>\n* Verbs are uninflected for number and person: there is no ''-s'' ending in the present-tense third-person singular. Example: ''She write poetry'' (\"She writes poetry\"). AAVE ''don't'' for standard English ''doesn't'' comes from this, unlike in some other dialects which use ''don't'' for standard English ''doesn't'' but ''does'' when not in the negative. Similarly, ''was'' is used for what in standard English are contexts for both ''was'' and ''were.''{{sfnp|Green|2002|p=38}}\n* The genitive -'s ending may or may not be used.{{sfnp|Green|2002|pp=102\u2013103}} Genitive case is inferrable from adjacency. This is similar to many creoles throughout the [[Caribbean]]. Many language forms throughout the world use an unmarked possessive; it may here result from a simplification of grammatical structures. Example: ''my momma sister'' (\"my mother's sister\")\n* The words ''it'' and ''they'' denote the existence of something, equivalent to standard English's ''there is'' or ''there are''.{{sfnp|Green|2002|p=80}}\n* Word order in questions: ''Why they ain't growing?'' (\"Why aren't they growing?\") and ''Who the hell she think she is?'' (\"Who the hell does she think she is?\") lack the inversion of most other forms of English. Because of this, there is also no need for the \"[[Do-support|auxiliary ''do'']]\".{{sfnp|Green|2002|pp=84\u201389}}\n* Usage of personal pronoun \"them\" instead of definite article \"those\" or \"these\".{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}\n\n== Vocabulary ==\nAAVE shares most of its lexicon with other varieties of English, particularly that of informal and [[Southern American English|Southern]] dialects; for example, the relatively recent use of ''[[y'all]]''. However, it has also been suggested that some of the vocabulary unique to AAVE has its origin in West African languages, but etymology is often difficult to trace and without a trail of recorded usage, the suggestions below cannot be considered proven. Early AAVE and Gullah contributed a number of African-originated words to the American English mainstream, including ''gumbo'',<ref>''Shorter OED,'' 5th edition, cf [[Bantu languages|Bantu]] ''kingumbo''</ref> ''goober'',<ref>''Shorter OED,'' 5th edition, [[Kikongo]] ''nguba''</ref> ''yam'', and ''banjo''.<ref>Nagle, S., & Sanders, S. (Eds.). (2003). English in the Southern United States (Studies in English Language). Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. p. 12.</ref>\n\nAAVE has also contributed slang expressions such as ''cool'' and ''hip''.{{sfnp|Guralnik|1984|p=?}} In many cases, the postulated etymologies are not recognized by linguists or the [[Oxford English Dictionary]], such as ''to dig'',<ref>This is from [[Wolof language|Wolof]] ''d\u00ebgg'' or ''d\u00ebgga'', meaning \"to understand/appreciate\" according to Smitherman 2000 s.v. \"Dig\"; or, it may instead come from [[Irish language|Irish]] ''[[wikt:tuig|tuig]]'', according to Random House Unabridged, 2001</ref> ''jazz'',{{sfnp|Rickford|Rickford|2000|p=146}}<!--citing one or more of \"David Dalby, Joseph Holloway, and Winifred Vass, among others\"; this should be checked--> ''tote'',{{sfnp|Rickford|Rickford|2000|p=146}} and ''bad-mouth'', a [[calque]] from [[Mandinka language|Mandinka]].<ref>{{harvcoltxt|Smitherman|1977|p=??}} cited in Rickford and Rickford, ''Spoken Soul,'' 240.<!-- who unfortunately don't give a page number for Smitherman or more detail of the allegedly Mandingo origin; must check for details. --></ref>\n\nAAVE also has words that either are not part of most other American English dialects or have strikingly different meanings. For example, there are several words in AAVE referring to white people that are not part of mainstream American English; these include ''gray'' as an adjective for whites (as in ''gray dude''), possibly from the color of [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] uniforms; and ''paddy'', an extension of the slang use for \"Irish\".<ref>''Gray'': Smitherman, ''Black Talk, s.v.'' \"Gray\". ''Paddy'': ''Dictionary of American Regional English, s.v.'' \"Paddy\".</ref>  \n\n\"[[wikt:ofay|Ofay]],\" which is [[pejorative]], is another general term for a [[White people|white person]]; it might derive from the [[Ibibio language|Ibibio]] word ''afia'', which means \"light-colored\", from the [[Yoruba language|Yoruba]] word ''ofe'', spoken in hopes of disappearing from danger, or via [[Pig Latin]] from \"foe\". However, most dictionaries simply say its etymology is unknown.<ref>{{harvcoltxt|Smitherman|2000}} suggests either a general West African or the Pig Latin origin. ''Black Talk'', s.v. \"Ofay\".</ref> \n\n''Kitchen'' refers to the particularly curly or kinky hair at the nape of the neck, and ''siditty'' or ''seddity'' means \"snobbish\" or \"bourgeois\".<ref>{{harvcoltxt|Smitherman|2000}}, s.v.'' \"Kitchen\". ''Kitchen, siditty'': ''Dictionary of American Regional English'', s.vv. \"Kitchen\", \"Siditty\".</ref>\n\nAAVE has also contributed various words and phrases to other varieties of English, including ''chill out'', ''main squeeze'', ''soul'', ''funky'', and ''threads''.{{sfnp|Lee|1999|pp=381\u2013386}}\n\n==Influence on other dialects==\nAfrican-American Vernacular English has influenced the development of other dialects of English. The AAVE accent, [[New York accent]], and Spanish-language accents have together yielded the sound of [[New York Latino English]], some of whose speakers use an accent indistinguishable from an AAVE one.{{sfnp|Blake|Shousterman|Newlin-\u0141ukowicz|2015|pp=284-285}} AAVE has also influenced certain [[Chicano English|Chicano accents]] and [[Liberian English|Liberian Settler English]], directly derived from the AAVE of the original 16,000 African Americans who migrated to Liberia in the 1800s.<ref>Singler, John Victor (2004).

In ''Handbook of Varieties of English'', edited by Bernd Kortmann and Edgar Schneider. Berlin: Mouton de Gruyter. p. 334.</ref> Urban AAVE alone is intensifying with the grammatical features exemplified in these sentences: \"He be the best\" (intensified equative ''be''), \"She be done had her baby\" (resultative ''be done''), and \"They come hollerin\" (indignant ''come''). On the other hand, rural AAVE alone shows certain features too, such as: \"I was a-huntin\" (''a''-prefixing); \"It riz above us\" (different irregular forms); and \"I want for to eat it\" (''for to'' complement).<ref>Wolfram, Walt (2004). \"The Grammar of Urban African American Vernacular English\". In ''Handbook of Varieties of English'', edited by Bernd Kortmann and Edgar Schneider. Berlin: Mouton de Gruyter. p. 335-336.</ref> Using the word ''bees'' even in place of ''be'' to mean ''is'' or ''are'' in standard English, as in the sentence \"That's the way it bees\" is also one of the rarest of all deep AAVE features today, and most middle-class AAVE speakers would recognize the verb ''bees'' as part of only a deep \"Southern\" or \"country\" speaker's vocabulary.{{sfnp|McWhorter|2001|pp=146\u20137}}\n\n===Local variations===\nNew York City AAVE incorporates some local features of the [[New York accent]], including its high {{Sc|thought}} vowel; meanwhile, conversely, Pittsburgh AAVE may merge this same vowel with the {{sc|lot}} vowel, matching the [[cot-caught merger]] of [[Western Pennsylvania English|white Pittsburgh accents]]. AAVE accents traditionally do not have the cot-caught merger. [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]], [[Atlanta]], and [[Research Triangle]] AAVE incorporates the {{sc|dress}} vowel raising and {{sc|face}} vowel lowering associated with [[Southern American English|white Southern accents]]. Memphis and St. Louis AAVE are developing, since the mid-twentieth century, an iconic [[Square-nurse merger|merger of the vowels in {{sc|square}} and {{sc|nurse}}]], making ''there'' sound like ''thurr''.<ref>Wolfram, Walt; Kohn, Mary E.

Oxford: Oxford University Press. pp. 149-151.</ref>\n\n== Social context ==\nAlthough the distinction between AAVE and [[General American]] accents is clear to most English speakers, some characteristics, notably double negatives and the omission of certain [[auxiliary verb|auxiliaries]] (see below) such as the ''has'' in ''has been'' are also characteristic of many colloquial dialects of American English. There is near-uniformity of AAVE grammar, despite its vast geographic spread across the whole country.{{sfnp|Labov|2001|pp=506\u2013508}} This may be due in part to relatively recent migrations of African Americans out of the [[Southern United States|American South]] (see [[Great Migration (African American)|Great Migration]] and [[Second Great Migration (African American)|Second Great Migration]]) as well as to long-term racial segregation that kept black people living together in largely homogeneous communities.{{sfnp|Wardhaugh|2002|p=339}}\n\nMisconceptions about AAVE are, and have long been, common, and have stigmatized its use. One myth is that AAVE is grammatically \"simple\" or \"sloppy\". However, like all dialects, AAVE shows consistent internal logic and grammatical complexity, and is used naturally by a group of people to express thoughts and ideas.<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Green|2002|p=217}}, citing {{Harvcoltxt|Burling|1973}} {{Harvcoltxt|Labov|1969}}</ref> [[Linguistic prescription|Prescriptively]], attitudes about AAVE are often less positive; since AAVE deviates from the standard, its use is commonly misinterpreted as a sign of ignorance, laziness, or both.{{sfnp|Green|2002|p=221}}<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Lanehart|2001|pp=4\u20136}} argues that it is no coincidence that a population that has historically been \"ridiculed and despised\" would have its characteristic speech variety treated the same way.</ref>  Perhaps because of this attitude (as well as similar attitudes among other Americans), most speakers of AAVE are bidialectal, being able to speak with more standard English features, and perhaps even a [[General American]] accent, as well as AAVE. Such linguistic adaptation in different environments is called [[code-switching]]{{sfnp|DeBose|1992|p=157}}{{sfnp|Wheeler|Swords|2006}}\u2014though {{Harvcoltxt|Linnes|1998}} argues that the situation is actually one of [[diglossia]]:<ref>Cited in {{Harvcoltxt|Kendall|Wolfram|2009|p=306}}</ref> each dialect, or code, is applied in different settings. Generally speaking, the degree of exclusive use of AAVE decreases with increasing [[socioeconomic status]] (although AAVE is still used by even well-educated African Americans).{{sfnp|Coulmas|2005|p=177}}{{sfnp|Rickford|Rickford|2000|p=8}}{{sfnp|DeBose|1992|p=159}}{{sfnp|Linnes|1998}}\n\nAnother myth is that AAVE is the native dialect (or even more inaccurately, a linguistic fad) employed by all African Americans. Wheeler (1999) warns that \"AAVE should not be thought of as the language of Black people in America. Many African Americans neither speak it nor know much about it\".{{sfnp|Wheeler|1999|p=55}}\n\n{{Harvcoltxt|Ogbu|1999}} argues that the use of AAVE carries racially affirmative political undertones as its use allows African Americans to assert their cultural upbringing.  Nevertheless, use of AAVE also carries strong social connotations; {{Harvcoltxt|Sweetland|2002}} presents a white female speaker of AAVE who is accepted as a member into African American social groups despite her race.\n\nBefore the substantial research of the 1960s and 1970s\u2014including [[William Labov]]'s groundbreakingly thorough grammatical study, ''Language in the Inner City''\u2014there was doubt that the speech of African Americans had any exclusive features not found in varieties spoken by other groups; {{Harvcoltxt|Williamson|1970}} noted that distinctive features of African American speech were present in the speech of Southerners and {{Harvcoltxt|Farrison|1970}} argued that there were really no substantial vocabulary or grammatical differences between the speech of blacks and that of other English dialects.<ref>Cited in {{Harvcoltxt|Green|2002|p=218}}</ref>\n\n=== In the legal system ===\n\nThe United States courts are divided over how to admit statements of ambiguous tense made in AAVE under evidence. In ''United States v. Arnold'', the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit]] held that \"he [[:wikt:finna#English|finna]] shoot me\" was a statement made in the [[present tense]], so it was admissible [[hearsay]] under the [[excited utterance]] exception; however, the dissent held that past or present tense could not be determined by the statement, so the statement should not have been admitted into evidence.<ref>''U.S. v.

Rickford and King (2016) argue that a lack of familiarity with AAVE (and other minority dialects of English) on the part of jurors, stenographers, and others can lead to misunderstandings in court. They especially focus on the [[Shooting of Trayvon Martin|Trayvon Martin case]] and how the testimony of Rachel Jeantel was perceived as incomprehensible and not credible by the jury due to her dialect.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Rickford|first=John R.|last2=King|first2=Sharese|date=2016-12-20|title=Language and linguistics on trial: Hearing Rachel Jeantel (and other vernacular speakers) in the courtroom and beyond|url=https://cpb-us-west-2-juc1ugur1qwqqqo4.stackpathdns.com/blog.nus.edu.sg/dist/d/3920/files/2017/01/RickfordKing_2016-2889rsv.pdf|journal=Language|language=en|volume=92|issue=4|pages=948\u2013988|doi=10.1353/lan.2016.0078|issn=1535-0665}}</ref>\n\n=== In music ===\n[[spiritual (music)|Spirituals]], [[blues]], [[jazz]], [[R&B]], and most recently, [[hip-hop music|hip-hop]] are all genres associated with [[African American music]]; as such, AAVE usually appears, through singing, speaking, or rapping, in these musical forms.

However, they tend to avoid the term ''[[nigga]]'', even as a marker of solidarity.{{sfnp|Cutler|2007}} White hip-hop artists such as Eyedea can choose to accentuate their whiteness by hyper-articulating postvocalic ''r'' sounds (i.e. the [[retroflex approximant]]).{{sfnp|Cutler|2007}}\n\nAAVE is also used by non-black artists in genres other than hip-hop, if less frequently. For instance, in \"[[Tonight Tonight (Hot Chelle Rae song)|Tonight, Tonight]]\", [[Hot Chelle Rae]] uses the term ''dime'' to mean \"an attractive woman\".{{sfnp|Smitherman|2000|p=108}} [[Jewel (singer)|Jewel]]'s \"Sometimes It Be That Way\" employs habitual ''be'' in the title to indicate [[habitual aspect]]. If they do not employ similar features of AAVE in their speech, then it can be argued that they are modeling their musical performance to evoke aspects of particular musical genres such as R&B or the blues (as British pop musicians of the 1960s and beyond did to evoke rock, pop, and the blues).{{sfnp|Trudgill|1983}} Some research suggests that non-African American young adults learn AAVE vocabulary by listening to hip-hop music.{{sfnp|Chesley|2011}}\n\n=== In social media ===\n\nOn Twitter, AAVE is used as a framework from which sentences and words are constructed, in order to accurately express oneself. {{sfnp|Florini|2014|p=233}} Grammatical features and word pronunciations stemming from AAVE are preserved. {{sfnp|Florini|2014|p=233}} Spellings based on AAVE have become increasingly common, to the point where it has become a normalized practice. Some examples include, \"you\" (you're), \"they\" (their/they're), \"gon/gone\" (going to), and \"yo\" (your). {{sfnp|Florini|2014|p=233}}\n\n=== In education ===\n{{main|African-American Vernacular English and education}}\nEducators traditionally have attempted to eliminate AAVE usage through the public education system, perceiving the dialect as grammatically defective.{{sfnp|Wardhaugh|2002|pp=343\u2013348}} In 1974, the teacher-led [[Conference on College Composition and Communication]] issued a position statement affirming students' rights to their own dialects and the validity of all dialects.{{sfnp|Smitherman|1999|p=357}} Mainstream linguistics has long agreed with this view about dialects.{{sfnp|McWhorter|2001}} In 1979, a judge ordered the Ann Arbor School District to find a way to identify AAVE speakers in the schools and to \"use that knowledge in teaching such students how to read standard English.\"<ref>Flood, J., Jensen, J., Lapp, D., Squire, J. (1991). ''Handbook of research on teaching the English language arts''. New York, NY: Macmillan Publishing Company.</ref> In 1996, [[Oakland Unified School District]] made a [[Oakland Ebonics resolution|controversial resolution]] for AAVE, which was later called \"Ebonics.\" The Oakland School board approved that Ebonics be recognized as a language independent from English (though this particular view is not endorsed by linguists), that teachers would participate in recognizing this language, and that it would be used in theory to support the transition from Ebonics to Standard American English in schools.

''[https://books.google.com/books?id=j5D8AgAAQBAJ&q=%22the+term+aave%22 Languages and Dialects in the U.S.: Focus on Diversity and Linguistics]''. Routledge. p. 102</ref> African-American English shows variation such as in vernacular versus standard forms, rural versus urban characteristics, features specific to singular cities or regions only, and other sociolinguistic criteria. There has also  been a significant body of [[African-American literature]] and [[oral tradition]] for centuries.\n\nAfrican-American English began as early as the seventeenth century, when the [[Atlantic slave trade]] brought African slaves into [[British colonization of the Americas|British-colonial North America]] in an area that became the [[Southern United States]] in the late eighteenth century.{{sfnp|Kautzsch|2004|p=341}} During the development of [[Plantations in the American South|plantation culture]] in this region, [[nonstandard dialect]]s of English were widely spoken by British settlers,{{sfnp|McWhorter|2001|pp=162, 182}} as well as likely some [[English-based creole languages|creolized varieties]], probably resulting in both first- and second-language English varieties developed by African Americans.{{sfnp|Kautzsch|2004|p=341}} The nineteenth century's evolving cotton-plantation industry, and eventually the twentieth century's [[Great Migration (African American)|Great Migration]], certainly contributed greatly to the spread of the first of these varieties as stable dialects of English among African Americans. The most widespread modern dialect is known as [[African-American Vernacular English]].{{sfnp|Edwards|2004|p=383}}\n\n==African-American Vernacular English==\n{{main|African-American Vernacular English}}\nAfrican-American Vernacular (AAVE) is the native [[variety (linguistics)|variety]] of the vast majority of [[working class|working-]] and [[middle class|middle-class]] [[African Americans]], particularly in urban areas,{{sfnp|Edwards|2004|p=383}} with its own unique accent, grammar, and vocabulary features. Typical features of the grammar include a [[zero copula|\"zero\" copula]] (e.g., ''she my sister'' instead of ''she's my sister''),<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Labov|1972|p=8}}</ref> omission of the genitive clitic (e.g., ''my momma friend'' instead of ''my mom's friend''),<ref name=\"Green 2002 119\u2013121\">{{Harvcoltxt|Green|2002|pp=119\u2013121}}</ref> and complexity of verb aspects and tenses beyond that of other English dialects (e.g., constructions like ''I'm a-run'', ''I be running'', ''I been runnin'', ''I done ran'').<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Fickett|1972|pp=17\u201319}}</ref> Common features of the phonology include [[Rhoticity in English|non-rhoticity]] (dropping the ''r'' sound at the end of syllables),<ref name=\"Green 2002 119\u2013121\"/> the [[Metathesis (linguistics)|metathetic use]] of ''aks'' instead of ''ask'',<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Baugh|2000|pp=92\u201394}}</ref> simplification of diphthongs (e.g., ''eye'' typically sounds like ''ah''),<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Labov|1972|p=19}}</ref> a [[raising (phonetics)|raising]] [[chain shift]] of the [[front vowel]]s,<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Thomas | first1 = Erik | year = 2007 | title = Phonological and phonetic characteristics of AAVE | url = | journal = Language and Linguistics Compass | volume = 1 | issue = | pages = 450\u2013475 | doi = 10.1111/j.1749-818X.2007.00029.x }}</ref> and a wider range of intonation or \"melody\" patterns than most [[General American]] accents.<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|McWhorter|2001|pp=146\u2013147}}</ref> AAVE is used by middle-class African Americans in casual, intimate, and informal settings as one end of a sociocultural language continuum,<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Linnes|1998|pp=339\u2013367}}</ref> and AAVE shows some slight variations by region or city.<ref>Walt Wolfram and Mary E.

These similarities include an accent that is rhotic, the categorical use of the grammatical construction \"he works\" or \"she goes\" (rather than the AAVE \"he work\" and \"she go\"), and Appalachian vocabulary (such as ''airish'' for \"windy\"). However, even African-American English in [[Appalachia]] is diverse, with African-American women linguistically divided along sociocultural lines.<ref>Wolfram, Walt.

Mainly four types of sources have been used for the historical reconstruction of older AAVE: written interviews, ex-slave audio recordings, the modern [[African-American diaspora|diaspora]] dialects of isolated black communities, and letters written by eighteenth- and nineteenth-century African Americans.{{sfnp|Kautzsch|2004|pp=342-344}} The use of the [[zero copula]] (the absence of ''is'' or ''are'', as in ''she gon' leave''), nonstandard plural forms (''the three man'', ''mans'', or even ''mens'') and [[multiple negative]]s (as in ''no one didn't leave me nothing'') were occasional or common variants in these earlier dialects, and the latter item even the preferred variant in certain grammatical contexts.{{sfnp|Kautzsch|2004|pp=347-349}} Other nonstandard grammatical constructions associated with AAVE are documented in older dialects too; however, many of them are not, evidently being recent innovations of twentieth-century urban AAVE.{{sfnp|Kautzsch|2004|pp=347}}\n\n==Gullah==\n[[Gullah language|Sea Island Creole English]], or \"Gullah\", is the distinct language of some African Americans along the South Carolina and Georgia coast.<ref name=\"ecology_gullah\">{{cite journal | last1 = Mufwene | first1 = Salikoko | year = 1997 | title = The ecology of Gullah's survival | url = | journal = American Speech | volume = 72 | issue = | pages = 69\u201383 | doi = 10.2307/455608 }}</ref> Gullah is an [[English creole]]: a natural language grammatically independent from English that uses mostly English vocabulary.

people]] in the [[United States]] and many in [[Canada]];{{sfnp|Edwards|2004|p=383}} most commonly, it refers to a dialect continuum ranging from [[African-American Vernacular English]] to a more [[standard English]].<ref>Di Paolo, Marianna; Spears, Arthur K. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=j5D8AgAAQBAJ&q=%22the+term+aave%22 Languages and Dialects in the U.S.: Focus on Diversity and Linguistics]''. Routledge. p. 102</ref> African-American English shows variation such as in vernacular versus standard forms, rural versus urban characteristics, features specific to singular cities or regions only, and other sociolinguistic criteria. There has also  been a significant body of [[African-American literature]] and [[oral tradition]] for centuries.\n\nAfrican-American English began as early as the seventeenth century, when the [[Atlantic slave trade]] brought African slaves into [[British colonization of the Americas|British-colonial North America]] in an area that became the [[Southern United States]] in the late eighteenth century.{{sfnp|Kautzsch|2004|p=341}} During the development of [[Plantations in the American South|plantation culture]] in this region, [[nonstandard dialect]]s of English were widely spoken by British settlers,{{sfnp|McWhorter|2001|pp=162, 182}} as well as likely some [[English-based creole languages|creolized varieties]], probably resulting in both first- and second-language English varieties developed by African Americans.{{sfnp|Kautzsch|2004|p=341}} The nineteenth century's evolving cotton-plantation industry, and eventually the twentieth century's [[Great Migration (African American)|Great Migration]], certainly contributed greatly to the spread of the first of these varieties as stable dialects of English among African Americans. The most widespread modern dialect is known as [[African-American Vernacular English]].{{sfnp|Edwards|2004|p=383}} \n\n==African-American Vernacular English==\n{{main|African-American Vernacular English}}\nAfrican-American Vernacular (AAVE) is the native [[variety (linguistics)|variety]] of the vast majority of [[working class|working-]] and [[middle class|middle-class]] [[African Americans]], particularly in urban areas,{{sfnp|Edwards|2004|p=383}} with its own unique accent, grammar, and vocabulary features. Typical features of the grammar include a [[zero copula|\"zero\" copula]] (e.g., ''she my sister'' instead of ''she's my sister''),<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Labov|1972|p=8}}</ref> omission of the genitive clitic (e.g., ''my momma friend'' instead of ''my mom's friend''),<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Green|2002|pp=119\u2013121}}</ref> and complexity of verb aspects and tenses beyond that of other English dialects (e.g., constructions like ''I'm a-run'', ''I be running'', ''I been runnin'', ''I done ran'').<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Fickett|1972|pp=17\u201319}}</ref> Common features of the phonology include [[Rhoticity in English|non-rhoticity]] (dropping the ''r'' sound at the end of syllables),<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Green|2002|pp=119\u2013121}}</ref> the [[Metathesis (linguistics)|metathetic use]] of ''aks'' instead of ''ask'',<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Baugh|2000|pp=92\u201394}}</ref> simplification of diphthongs (e.g., ''eye'' typically sounds like ''ah''),<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Labov|1972|p=19}}</ref> a [[raising (phonetics)|raising]] [[chain shift]] of the [[front vowel]]s,<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Thomas | first1 = Erik | year = 2007 | title = Phonological and phonetic characteristics of AAVE | url = | journal = Language and Linguistics Compass | volume = 1 | issue = | pages = 450\u2013475 | doi = 10.1111/j.1749-818X.2007.00029.x }}</ref> and a wider range of intonation or \"melody\" patterns than most [[General American]] accents.<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|McWhorter|2001|pp=146\u2013147}}</ref> AAVE is used by middle-class African Americans in casual, intimate, and informal settings as one end of a sociocultural language continuum,<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Linnes|1998|pp=339\u2013367}}</ref> and AAVE shows some slight variations by region or city.<ref>Walt Wolfram and Mary E.

This variety exhibits [[standard English]] vocabulary and grammar but often retains certain elements of the unique AAVE accent,{{sfnp|Rickford|2015|pp=302, 310}}{{sfnp|Spears|2015}} with intonational or rhythmic features maintained more than phonological ones.<ref name=\"Green 2002 125\">{{Cite book|title=African American English: a linguistic introduction|last=Green|first=Lisa J.|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2002|isbn=0-521-81449-9|location=Cambridge|pages=[https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780521891387/page/125 125]|url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780521891387/page/125}}</ref> Most middle-class African Americans are typically [[wikt:bidialectal|bi-dialectal]] between this standard variety and AAVE, learning the former variety through schooling, so that adults will frequently even [[codeswitch]] between the two varieties within a single conversation.

These similarities include an accent that is rhotic, the categorical use of the grammatical construction \"he works\" or \"she goes\" (rather than the AAVE \"he work\" and \"she go\"), and Appalachian vocabulary (such as ''airish'' for \"windy\"). However, even African-American English in [[Appalachia]] is diverse, with African-American women linguistically divided along sociocultural lines.<ref>Wolfram, Walt.

Of primary interest is the direct theoretical predecessor to AAVE. Mainly four types of sources have been used for the historical reconstruction of older AAVE: written interviews, ex-slave audio recordings, the modern [[African-American diaspora|diaspora]] dialects of isolated black communities, and letters written by eighteenth- and nineteenth-century African Americans.{{sfnp|Kautzsch|2004|pp=342-344}} The use of the [[zero copula]] (the absence of ''is'' or ''are'', as in ''she gon' leave''), nonstandard plural forms (''the three man'', ''mans'', or even ''mens'') and [[multiple negative]]s (as in ''no one didn't leave me nothing'') were occasional or common variants in these earlier dialects, and the latter item even the preferred variant in certain grammatical contexts.{{sfnp|Kautzsch|2004|pp=347-349}} Other nonstandard grammatical constructions associated with AAVE are documented in older dialects too; however, many of them are not, evidently being recent innovations of twentieth-century urban AAVE.{{sfnp|Kautzsch|2004|pp=347}}\n\n==Gullah==\n[[Gullah language|Sea Island Creole English]], or \"Gullah\", is the distinct language of some African Americans along the South Carolina and Georgia coast.<ref name=\"ecology_gullah\">{{cite journal | last1 = Mufwene | first1 = Salikoko | year = 1997 | title = The ecology of Gullah's survival | url = | journal = American Speech | volume = 72 | issue = | pages = 69\u201383 | doi = 10.2307/455608 }}</ref> Gullah is an [[English creole]]: a natural language grammatically independent from English that uses mostly English vocabulary.
