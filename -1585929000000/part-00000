Additionally, many liner notes from the band's albums list attorney [[Bertis Downs]] and manager [[Jefferson Holt]] as non-musical members.  One of the first [[alternative rock]] bands, R.E.M. was noted for Buck's ringing, [[arpeggiated]] guitar style, Stipe's distinctive vocal quality, unique stage presence and obscure lyrics, Mills's melodic basslines and backing vocals, and Berry's tight, economical drumming. \n\nR.E.M. released its first single, \"[[Radio Free Europe (song)|Radio Free Europe]]\", in 1981 on the independent record label [[Hib-Tone]]. It was followed by the ''[[Chronic Town]]'' [[Extended play|EP]] in 1982, the band's first release on [[I.R.S. Records]]. In 1983, the group released its critically acclaimed debut album, ''[[Murmur (album)|Murmur]]'', and built its reputation over the next few years through subsequent releases, constant touring, and the support of [[campus radio|college radio]]. Following years of underground success, R.E.M. achieved a mainstream hit with the 1987 single \"[[The One I Love (R.E.M. song)|The One I Love]]\". The group signed to [[Warner Bros. Records]] in 1988, and began to espouse political and environmental concerns while playing large arenas worldwide.\n\nIn the early 1990s, other [[alternative rock]] acts such as [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]] and [[Pavement (band)|Pavement]] viewed R.E.M. as a pioneer of the genre. R.E.M.'s most commercially successful albums, ''[[Out of Time (album)|Out of Time]]'' (1991) and ''[[Automatic for the People]]'' (1992), brought it to the vanguard of alternative rock just as it was becoming mainstream. ''Out of Time'' received seven nominations at the [[34th Annual Grammy Awards]], and lead single \"[[Losing My Religion]]\", was R.E.M.'s highest-charting and best-selling hit. R.E.M.'s 1994 album ''[[Monster (R.E.M. album)|Monster]]'' continued its run of success. The band began its first tour in six years to support the album; the tour was marred by medical emergencies suffered by three of the band members.\n\nIn 1996, R.E.M. re-signed with Warner Bros. for a reported US$80&nbsp;million, at the time the most expensive recording contract in history. Its 1996 release, ''[[New Adventures in Hi-Fi]]'', though critically acclaimed, was less commercially successful. Berry left the band the following year, and Stipe, Buck, and Mills continued as a trio. Through some changes in musical style to include [[electronic music]] and [[pop rock]] sounds, the band continued its career into the next decade with mixed critical and commercial success, despite having sold more than 85 million records worldwide and becoming one of the [[List of best-selling music artists|world's best-selling music artists]].<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/21/sports/mike-mills-a-rock-star-of-fantasy-sports.html?pagewanted=all|title=Mike Mills: A Rock Star of Fantasy Sports |work=[[The New York Times]] |author=Mike Tierney |date=April 20, 2013 |accessdate=May 18, 2013}}</ref> In 2007, the band was inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]], in its first year of eligibility.

Additionally, many liner notes from the band's albums list attorney [[Bertis Downs]] and manager [[Jefferson Holt]] as non-musical members.  One of the first [[alternative rock]] bands, R.E.M. was noted for Buck's ringing, [[arpeggiated]] guitar style, Stipe's distinctive vocal quality, unique stage presence and obscure lyrics, Mills's melodic basslines and backing vocals, and Berry's tight, economical drumming. \n\nR.E.M. released its first single, \"[[Radio Free Europe (song)|Radio Free Europe]]\", in 1981 on the independent record label [[Hib-Tone]]. It was followed by the ''[[Chronic Town]]'' [[Extended play|EP]] in 1982, the band's first release on [[I.R.S. Records]]. In 1983, the group released its critically acclaimed debut album, ''[[Murmur (album)|Murmur]]'', and built its reputation over the next few years through subsequent releases, constant touring, and the support of [[campus radio|college radio]]. Following years of underground success, R.E.M. achieved a mainstream hit with the 1987 single \"[[The One I Love (R.E.M. song)|The One I Love]]\". The group signed to [[Warner Bros. Records]] in 1988, and began to espouse political and environmental concerns while playing large arenas worldwide.\n\nIn the early 1990s, other [[alternative rock]] acts such as [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]] and [[Pavement (band)|Pavement]] viewed R.E.M. as a pioneer of the genre. R.E.M.'s most commercially successful albums, ''[[Out of Time (album)|Out of Time]]'' (1991) and ''[[Automatic for the People]]'' (1992), brought it to the vanguard of alternative rock just as it was becoming mainstream. ''Out of Time'' received seven nominations at the [[34th Annual Grammy Awards]], and lead single \"[[Losing My Religion]]\", was R.E.M.'s highest-charting and best-selling hit. R.E.M.'s 1994 album ''[[Monster (R.E.M. album)|Monster]]'' continued its run of success. The band began its first tour in six years to support the album; the tour was marred by medical emergencies suffered by three of the band members.\n\nIn 1996, R.E.M. re-signed with Warner Bros. for a reported US$80&nbsp;million, at the time the most expensive recording contract in history. Its 1996 release, ''[[New Adventures in Hi-Fi]]'', though critically acclaimed, was less commercially successful. Berry left the band the following year, and Stipe, Buck, and Mills continued as a trio. Through some changes in musical style to include [[electronic music]] and [[pop rock]] sounds, the band continued its career into the next decade with mixed critical and commercial success, despite having sold more than 85 million records worldwide and becoming one of the [[List of best-selling music artists|world's best-selling music artists]].<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/21/sports/mike-mills-a-rock-star-of-fantasy-sports.html?pagewanted=all|title=Mike Mills: A Rock Star of Fantasy Sports |work=[[The New York Times]] |author=Mike Tierney |date=April 20, 2013 |accessdate=May 18, 2013}}</ref> In 2007, the band was inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]], in its first year of eligibility. After releasing the well received album ''[[Accelerate (R.E.M. album)|Accelerate]]'' (2008) and ''[[Collapse into Now]]'' (2011), R.E.M. disbanded amicably in September 2011. The former members have continued with various musical projects, and several live and archival albums have been released.\n\n==History==\n\n===1980\u20131981: Formation===\n[[File:Mitch michael scott.jpg|left|alt=Mitch Easter sitting at a mixing board next to Michael Quercio and Scott Miller|thumb|[[Mitch Easter]] (far left) was R.E.M.'s producer until 1984, helping to define the band's early sound]]\n\nIn January 1980, [[Peter Buck]] met [[Michael Stipe]] in [[Wuxtry Records]], the Athens record store where Buck worked.

He was christened with the names Charles Bergemann, though the family always called him Karl, the name he was to use in later life.{{efn|Several parts of these biographical notes have been taken from the William Morris Gallery Exhibition catalogue for their exhibition \"Karl Parsons 1884-1934\" held 24 October 1987 to 12 March 1988}}<ref name=\"Karl Parson Exhibition catalog\">{{cite book |title=Karl Parsons, 1884-1934: Stained Glass Artist - Exhibition Catalogue |date=1887 |publisher=William Morris Gallery |location=London |isbn=978-0901974259 |pages=30}}</ref>\n\nFrom 1893 to 1898 he attended [[Haberdashers' Aske's Hatcham College|Haberdashers' Aske's Hatcham Boys School]] at [[New Cross]] in south London.\n\n==Introduction to Whall, 1898 \u2013 outbreak of war==\n[[File:Christopher Whall garden party 1900.jpg|thumb|right|Garden party at Whall's house. Karl Parsons standing back row, first left.]]\nOne of Parsons\u2019 older sisters was the artist [[Beatrice Emma Parsons]] (1869\u20131955). Beatrice worked for a while in [[Christopher Whall]]\u2019s studio and when Parsons left school, Beatrice persuaded Whall to take him on as an apprentice.  Whall it seems saw promise in Parsons' [[Sketch (drawing)|sketches]].  Apart from starting with Whall as a pupil-apprentice at Whall\u2019s [[Hammersmith]] studio, he also worked at [[Lowndes and Drury]] in Chelsea, this under Whall\u2019s supervision.  He also attended Whall\u2019s classes at the [[London County Council|L.C.C.]] [[Central School of Arts & Crafts]].<ref name=\"Peter Cormack Book\">{{cite book |last1=Cormack |first1=Peter |title=Arts & Crafts Stained Glass |date=2015 |publisher=Paul Mellon Centre |isbn=978-0300209709}}</ref>\n[[File:Karl Parsons St Cecilia playing the organ.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Chalk drawing of [[St Cecilia]] playing the organ.]]\nHe completed his apprenticeship in the 1900s and then worked as one of Whall\u2019s assistants. In September 1904 he began teaching at the Central School, initially as one of Whall\u2019s assistants and then as principal teacher of stained glass. One pupil was [[M. E. Aldrich Rope]], cousin of [[Margaret Agnes Rope]]. Another pupil was Joan [[John Fulleylove|Fulleylove]] who worked with [[Mabel Esplin]] and in fact continued Esplin's work for the [[Anglicanism|Anglican]] cathedral in [[Khartoum]] when Esplin could no longer do so.\n\nThroughout the 1900s he was to assist Whall on his major commissions and in 1905 drew some of the illustrations for Whall\u2019s book ''Stained Glass Work''{{efn|Both Parsons and Edward Woore provided diagrams for the book and plant studies by Parsons were included in Plate XIV of the collotype illustrations.  One of the diagrams (Figure 69) shows a special utensil for applying wax to the glass-painter\u2019s easel, described by Whall as \"the invention of one of my youngest \"hands\" (and heads).\" This may well have been a reference to Parsons as the diagram is signed with his initials and it is certainly known that he used the \"waxing-up\" tool for his own work and recommended its use to his pupils.}} this along with fellow student [[Edward Woore]].  Parsons assisted Whall with the windows for [[Gloucester Cathedral]] and also those for [[Canterbury Cathedral]], [[Southwell Minster]], [[Tonbridge School]] Chapel, and churches in [[Ashbourne, Derbyshire|Ashbourne]], [[Ledbury]] and [[Burford]].\n\nIn 1907 he married Grace Millicent Simmons.  She too studied at the Central School and became an Arts and Crafts [[Embroidery|embroiderer]].\n\nIn 1908 he worked with Whall on the design and execution of [[apse]] windows for [[St. George's Cathedral, Cape Town|Cape Town Cathedral]] and in that year set up his own studio at the Glass House in Fulham.{{efn|see reference to The Glass House in [[Works of Christopher Whall]]}} In the same year he began work on his first independent commission, a series of windows for St Alban, [[Hindhead]]. He also exhibited three designs at the [[Royal Academy of Arts|Royal Academy]] and 25 September 1908 saw the birth of his daughter Margaret Rosetta.\n\nIt was the architect [[Herbert Baker]] who had asked Whall to take on the Cape Town windows and it was Baker\u2019s associate Fleming, who in later years was to invite Parsons to undertake other commissions in South Africa.{{efn|After Parsons\u2019 death Baker wrote a letter to The Times in which he praised the \"purity and richness of colour harmony\" of the Cape Town and Johannesburg windows.}} Close connections with architects were important to people like Parsons and he was to have a similar relationship with [[Robert Lorimer]] in Scotland which was to lead to his receiving important Scottish commissions.  Other important contacts were John Duke Coleridge, and [[Pick Everard|Everard and Pick]].{{efn|John Duke Coleridge (1879-1934) was taught by Walter Cave and Edwin Lutyens.  He was the architect of St Alban\u2019s Church in Hindhead and St John\u2019s Church in Rudmore. Everard & Pick were architects for St Peter\u2019s in Bardon Hill and St Philip\u2019s in Leicester.}}  Whall had similarly benefitted from close ties to the likes of the architects [[John Dando Sedding]] and [[Henry Wilson]].\n\nDuring the period 1909 to 1910, he worked for a short period with [[Louis Davis]], cartooning windows from Davis\u2019 designs.  In 1910 he exhibited designs at the Arts and Crafts Exhibition.  Certainly Parsons worked closely with Davis in 1910 on the windows for St Anseln church (seven lancets for the Holy Spirit chapel) and [[Holy Trinity Church, St Andrews|Holy Trinity]] in St Andrew\u2019s Fife (a five-light Crucifixion window). It was Davis who had introduced Parsons to Robert Lorimer. In 1910, Parsons lived at 38 Gainsborough Road in [[Bedford Park, London]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Karl B.

As a teacher, Parsons was, like Whall before him, to inspire several of his pupils to become stained glass artists, including [[Lilian Pocock]], Joseph E. Nuttgens and [[Herbert Hendrie]].{{efn|Lilian Pocock (1883-1974).  Worked for a time as Parsons\u2019 assistant before starting out on her own.  Joseph E.Nuttgens (1892-1982).  A student at the Central School, Nuttgens carried out work for other artists as well as working independently.  Herbert Hendrie (1887-1946) was Parsons\u2019 pupil at Royal College of Art.

Both were ex-pupils.\n\n1924 saw Parsons make what was to prove a seminal visit to [[Chartres]] where, with his brother Ambrose, he carried out a detailed study of medieval glass.  Parsons wrote \"So far as my knowledge goes, this world cannot show anything made by men so amazingly beautiful\".\n\nIn 1927 he was commissioned to make the apse windows for the new [[St Mary's Cathedral, Johannesburg|St Mary\u2019s Cathedral]] in Johannesburg.\n\n1929 saw a collection of [[poem]]s that he had written published by the [[Medici Society]] under the title ''Ann\u2019s Book''. His daughter Jacynth provided the illustrations. (The previous year she had illustrated ''Forty Nine Poems'' by [[W. H. Davies]], also for Medici). Over the years Parsons had several of his poems published in anthologies and periodicals.  In the same year he resigned from his teaching post at the Central School.\n\n==1930 to 1934 \u2013 final years==\n\nIn 1930 Parsons moved from [[Northwood, London|Northwood]], where he had lived for many years{{what|date=November 2018}}, to [[Shalbourne]] in Wiltshire.  There he set up a studio at Ropewind Farm where he converted a mid-18th century [[English barn|three-bay barn]], adding a large, porch-like window to let in natural light on the north side.  He also incorporated a small [[granary]] on unusual brick and timber [[Staddle stones|staddle]]s thus converting it into a larger purpose-built storage building and garage, giving access directly from Rivar Road. The house he lived in adjoined the site.  It should have been an idyllic time for Parsons but his health deteriorated and finally, in 1933, he had to return to London, took a flat in [[Putney]] and worked for a while with his great friend [[Edward Woore]]. He died there the following year at the young age of 50.

Karl Parsons standing back row, first left.]]\nOne of Parsons\u2019 older sisters was the artist [[Beatrice Emma Parsons]] (1869\u20131955). Beatrice worked for a while in [[Christopher Whall]]\u2019s studio and when Parsons left school, Beatrice persuaded Whall to take him on as an apprentice.  Whall it seems saw promise in Parsons' [[Sketch (drawing)|sketches]].  Apart from starting with Whall as a pupil-apprentice at Whall\u2019s [[Hammersmith]] studio, he also worked at [[Lowndes and Drury]] in Chelsea, this under Whall\u2019s supervision.  He also attended Whall\u2019s classes at the [[London County Council|L.C.C.]] [[Central School of Arts & Crafts]].<ref name=\"Peter Cormack Book\">{{cite book |last1=Cormack |first1=Peter |title=Arts & Crafts Stained Glass |date=2015 |publisher=Paul Mellon Centre |isbn=978-0300209709}}</ref>\n[[File:Karl Parsons St Cecilia playing the organ.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Chalk drawing of [[St Cecilia]] playing the organ.]]\nHe completed his apprenticeship in the 1900s and then worked as one of Whall\u2019s assistants. In September 1904 he began teaching at the Central School, initially as one of Whall\u2019s assistants and then as principal teacher of stained glass. One pupil was [[M. E. Aldrich Rope]], cousin of [[Margaret Agnes Rope]]. Another pupil was Joan [[John Fulleylove|Fulleylove]] who worked with [[Mabel Esplin]] and in fact continued Esplin's work for the [[Anglicanism|Anglican]] cathedral in [[Khartoum]] when Esplin could no longer do so.\n\nThroughout the 1900s he was to assist Whall on his major commissions and in 1905 drew some of the illustrations for Whall\u2019s book ''Stained Glass Work''{{efn|Both Parsons and Edward Woore provided diagrams for the book and plant studies by Parsons were included in Plate XIV of the collotype illustrations.  One of the diagrams (Figure 69) shows a special utensil for applying wax to the glass-painter\u2019s easel, described by Whall as \"the invention of one of my youngest \"hands\" (and heads).\" This may well have been a reference to Parsons as the diagram is signed with his initials and it is certainly known that he used the \"waxing-up\" tool for his own work and recommended its use to his pupils.}} this along with fellow student [[Edward Woore]].  Parsons assisted Whall with the windows for [[Gloucester Cathedral]] and also those for [[Canterbury Cathedral]], [[Southwell Minster]], [[Tonbridge School]] Chapel, and churches in [[Ashbourne, Derbyshire|Ashbourne]], [[Ledbury]] and [[Burford]].\n\nIn 1907 he married Grace Millicent Simmons.  She too studied at the Central School and became an Arts and Crafts [[Embroidery|embroiderer]].\n\nIn 1908 he worked with Whall on the design and execution of [[apse]] windows for [[St. George's Cathedral, Cape Town|Cape Town Cathedral]] and in that year set up his own studio at the Glass House in Fulham.{{efn|see reference to The Glass House in [[Works of Christopher Whall]]}} In the same year he began work on his first independent commission, a series of windows for St Alban, [[Hindhead]]. He also exhibited three designs at the [[Royal Academy of Arts|Royal Academy]] and 25 September 1908 saw the birth of his daughter Margaret Rosetta.\n\nIt was the architect [[Herbert Baker]] who had asked Whall to take on the Cape Town windows and it was Baker\u2019s associate Fleming, who in later years was to invite Parsons to undertake other commissions in South Africa.{{efn|After Parsons\u2019 death Baker wrote a letter to The Times in which he praised the \"purity and richness of colour harmony\" of the Cape Town and Johannesburg windows.}} Close connections with architects were important to people like Parsons and he was to have a similar relationship with [[Robert Lorimer]] in Scotland which was to lead to his receiving important Scottish commissions.  Other important contacts were John Duke Coleridge, and [[Pick Everard|Everard and Pick]].{{efn|John Duke Coleridge (1879-1934) was taught by Walter Cave and Edwin Lutyens.  He was the architect of St Alban\u2019s Church in Hindhead and St John\u2019s Church in Rudmore. Everard & Pick were architects for St Peter\u2019s in Bardon Hill and St Philip\u2019s in Leicester.}}  Whall had similarly benefitted from close ties to the likes of the architects [[John Dando Sedding]] and [[Henry Wilson]].\n\nDuring the period 1909 to 1910, he worked for a short period with [[Louis Davis]], cartooning windows from Davis\u2019 designs.  In 1910 he exhibited designs at the Arts and Crafts Exhibition.  Certainly Parsons worked closely with Davis in 1910 on the windows for St Anseln church (seven lancets for the Holy Spirit chapel) and [[Holy Trinity Church, St Andrews|Holy Trinity]] in St Andrew\u2019s Fife (a five-light Crucifixion window). It was Davis who had introduced Parsons to Robert Lorimer. In 1910, Parsons lived at 38 Gainsborough Road in [[Bedford Park, London]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Karl B.

Faced with opportunity and misguided by love, the characters are all confronted with their own buried selfishness.\"<ref>[http://www.screenonline.org.uk/film/id/509372/ ''The Secret Place''] at [[BFI Screenonline]]</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{imdb title|id=0050947|title=The Secret Place}}\n*[http://www.screenonline.org.uk/film/id/509372/ ''The Secret Place''] at [[BFI Screenonline]]\n{{Clive Donner}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Secret Place, The}}\n\n[[Category:1957 films]]\n[[Category:British films]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Clive Donner]]\n[[Category:Films shot at Pinewood Studios]]\n[[Category:English-language films]]\n[[Category:British crime drama films]]\n[[Category:1950s crime drama films]]\n[[Category:Films set in London]]\n[[Category:Directorial debut films]]\n\n{{1950s-UK-film-stub}}\n{{1950s-crime-film-stub}}\n", "name_user": "DavidRayner", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Secret_Place_(film)"}

However, cyanazine or cyanazine degradation products have not been detected in [[food]].  Based on data from [[Canada]] and the [[Netherlands]], intake from [[drinking water]] is around an estimate 0.2-0.3&nbsp;\u00b5g/day. The [[World Health Organization|WHO]] organisation therefore set a maximum value of 0.198&nbsp;\u00b5g/kg body weight, due to possible [[Toxicity|toxic effects]] to [[human]]s.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.who.int/water_sanitation_health/dwq/chemicals/cyanazine.pdf|title=World Health Organisation (WHO) on cyanazine}}</ref>\nFurthermore, as seen in the table above, aquatic lifeforms are affected at a much lower [[concentration]] of cyanazine than [[terrestrial animal]]s. That, combined with the fact that cyanazine quickly washes out of the [[soil]] to the surrounding waters, makes that the [[aquatic ecosystem]]s are most compromised by cyanazine.\n\n== Toxicity == \n[[Triazine]] [[herbicide]]s like cyanazine are extremely [[Toxicity|toxic]] to certain types of [[plant]]s. This is why they are so effective in killing specific species of broadleaf weeds. Cyanazine will result in the disfunction of [[photosystem II]] by binding important proteins which are required for this process. When this important step in [[photosynthesis]] fails, a plant is not able to produce sugars which are crucial for its growth and [[metabolism]].\n\n== Toxicity in humans ==\n\n* '''Acute effects'''\n\nContact with cyanazine may cause [[dermatitis]] depending on the severity of the contact. Also, when high levels of cyanazine are being ingested, [[acute toxicity]] can occur. [[Inhalation]] of cyanazine fumes may lead to airway irritation.\n\n* '''[[Carcinogenesis]]'''\n\nThe [[carcinogen]]ic effects of cyanazine were unclear for a long time. However, it is not likely that this [[herbicide]] will have any [[carcinogen]]ic effects on humans.<ref>S. M. Lynch ''et al.'', \u201cCancer incidence among pesticide applicators exposed to cyanazine in the agricultural health study,\u201d ''Environ. Health Perspect.'', vol. 114, no. 8, pp. 1248\u20131252, Aug. 2006.</ref> More research is needed to fully confirm that cyanazine is not [[carcinogen]]ic. This is why the [[USEPA]] rated cyanazine as a group C [[Chemical substance|chemical]]; this means that it could be [[carcinogen]]ic.\n\n== Toxicity in animals ==\n\n* '''Endocrine-related effects'''   \nResearch has shown that [[atrazine]] is able to influence the LH and [[Prolactin|prolactin secretion]] of female [[rat]]s. These [[Hormone|hormonal]] changes appear to be caused by an altered function of the [[Pituitary gland|pituitary]].<ref>R. L. Cooper, \u201cAtrazine Disrupts the Hypothalamic Control of Pituitary-Ovarian Function,\u201d ''Toxicol. Sci.'', vol. 53, no. 2, pp. 297\u2013307, Feb. 2000.</ref> As cyanazine belongs to the same class of [[herbicide]]s as [[atrazine]], the effect on the [[Hormone|hormonal]] status of rats by cyanazine could be the same. Cyanazine may also influence [[GABAA receptor|GABAA-receptors]] in the [[brain]] of [[rat]]s, depending on the dosage that is given. This can cause disruptions in [[Gonadotropin-releasing hormone|GnRH]]-release.<ref>T. J. Shafer, T. R. Ward, C. A. Meacham, and R. L. Cooper, \u201cEffects of the chlorotriazine herbicide, cyanazine, on GABAA receptors in cortical tissue from rat brain,\u201d ''Toxicology'', vol. 142, no. 1, pp. 57\u201368, Dec. 1999.</ref>\n* '''Teratogenesis'''    \nCyanazine may cause [[malformations]] in the [[embryo]]nal development of some [[species]]. In [[Western clawed frog|Silurana tropicalis]], exposure to [[triazine]] [[herbicide]]s like cyanazine may cause severe abnormalities.<ref>M. Saka, N. Tada, and Y. Kamata, \u201cChronic toxicity of 1,3,5-triazine herbicides in the postembryonic development of the western clawed frog Silurana tropicalis,\u201d ''Ecotoxicol. Environ. Saf.'', vol. 147, pp. 373\u2013381, 2018.</ref> It is unclear whether these effects could be seen in humans too. Also, [[eye defects]] in [[rat]] [[Fetus|foetuses]] could be the effect of [[Toxicity|toxic properties]] of cyanazine.<ref>P. Iyer, D. Gammon, J. Gee, and K. Pfeifer, \u201cCharacterization of Maternal Influence on Teratogenicity: An Assessment of Developmental Toxicity Studies for the Herbicide Cyanazine1,2,\u201d ''Regul. Toxicol. Pharmacol.'', vol. 29, no. 1, pp. 88\u201395, 1999.</ref> \n* '''Synergistic toxicity'''   \nDifferent [[triazine]] [[herbicide]]s appear to have a synergistic effect on specific [[Species|animal species]]. In the case of cyanazine, [[atrazine]] can cause effects on non-target species like Chironomus tentans. [[Atrazine]] is able to influence the activity of [[Cytochrome P450|P450]] enzymes in midges and therefore cause increased [[toxicity]] of these [[herbicide]]s.<ref>Y. Jin-Clark, M. J. Lydy, and K.

The free [[ethyl group]] will then by excreted by breathing.<ref>Crayford JV, Hutson DH (1972) Metabolism of the herbicide 2-chloro-4-(ethylamino)-6- (1-cyano-1-methylethylamino)-s-triazine in the rat [MRID No. 00022856].

However, cyanazine or cyanazine degradation products have not been detected in [[food]].  Based on data from [[Canada]] and the [[Netherlands]], intake from [[drinking water]] is around an estimate 0.2-0.3&nbsp;\u00b5g/day. The [[World Health Organization|WHO]] organisation therefore set a maximum value of 0.198&nbsp;\u00b5g/kg body weight, due to possible [[Toxicity|toxic effects]] to [[human]]s.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.who.int/water_sanitation_health/dwq/chemicals/cyanazine.pdf|title=World Health Organisation (WHO) on cyanazine}}</ref>\nFurthermore, as seen in the table above, aquatic lifeforms are affected at a much lower [[concentration]] of cyanazine than [[terrestrial animal]]s. That, combined with the fact that cyanazine quickly washes out of the [[soil]] to the surrounding waters, makes that the [[aquatic ecosystem]]s are most compromised by cyanazine.\n\n== Toxicity == \n[[Triazine]] [[herbicide]]s like cyanazine are extremely [[Toxicity|toxic]] to certain types of [[plant]]s. This is why they are so effective in killing specific species of broadleaf weeds. Cyanazine will result in the disfunction of [[photosystem II]] by binding important proteins which are required for this process. When this important step in [[photosynthesis]] fails, a plant is not able to produce sugars which are crucial for its growth and [[metabolism]].\n\n== Toxicity in humans ==\n\n* '''Acute effects'''\n\nContact with cyanazine may cause [[dermatitis]] depending on the severity of the contact. Also, when high levels of cyanazine are being ingested, [[acute toxicity]] can occur. [[Inhalation]] of cyanazine fumes may lead to airway irritation.\n\n* '''[[Carcinogenesis]]'''\n\nThe [[carcinogen]]ic effects of cyanazine were unclear for a long time. However, it is not likely that this [[herbicide]] will have any [[carcinogen]]ic effects on humans.<ref>S. M. Lynch ''et al.'', \u201cCancer incidence among pesticide applicators exposed to cyanazine in the agricultural health study,\u201d ''Environ. Health Perspect.'', vol. 114, no. 8, pp. 1248\u20131252, Aug. 2006.</ref> More research is needed to fully confirm that cyanazine is not [[carcinogen]]ic. This is why the [[USEPA]] rated cyanazine as a group C [[Chemical substance|chemical]]; this means that it could be [[carcinogen]]ic.\n\n== Toxicity in animals ==\n\n* '''Endocrine-related effects'''   \nResearch has shown that [[atrazine]] is able to influence the LH and [[Prolactin|prolactin secretion]] of female [[rat]]s. These [[Hormone|hormonal]] changes appear to be caused by an altered function of the [[Pituitary gland|pituitary]].<ref>R. L. Cooper, \u201cAtrazine Disrupts the Hypothalamic Control of Pituitary-Ovarian Function,\u201d ''Toxicol. Sci.'', vol. 53, no. 2, pp. 297\u2013307, Feb. 2000.</ref> As cyanazine belongs to the same class of [[herbicide]]s as [[atrazine]], the effect on the [[Hormone|hormonal]] status of rats by cyanazine could be the same. Cyanazine may also influence [[GABAA receptor|GABAA-receptors]] in the [[brain]] of [[rat]]s, depending on the dosage that is given. This can cause disruptions in [[Gonadotropin-releasing hormone|GnRH]]-release.<ref>T. J. Shafer, T. R. Ward, C. A. Meacham, and R. L. Cooper, \u201cEffects of the chlorotriazine herbicide, cyanazine, on GABAA receptors in cortical tissue from rat brain,\u201d ''Toxicology'', vol. 142, no. 1, pp. 57\u201368, Dec. 1999.</ref>\n* '''Teratogenesis'''    \nCyanazine may cause [[malformations]] in the [[embryo]]nal development of some [[species]]. In [[Western clawed frog|Silurana tropicalis]], exposure to [[triazine]] [[herbicide]]s like cyanazine may cause severe abnormalities.<ref>M. Saka, N. Tada, and Y. Kamata, \u201cChronic toxicity of 1,3,5-triazine herbicides in the postembryonic development of the western clawed frog Silurana tropicalis,\u201d ''Ecotoxicol. Environ. Saf.'', vol. 147, pp. 373\u2013381, 2018.</ref> It is unclear whether these effects could be seen in humans too. Also, [[eye defects]] in [[rat]] [[Fetus|foetuses]] could be the effect of [[Toxicity|toxic properties]] of cyanazine.<ref>P. Iyer, D. Gammon, J. Gee, and K. Pfeifer, \u201cCharacterization of Maternal Influence on Teratogenicity: An Assessment of Developmental Toxicity Studies for the Herbicide Cyanazine1,2,\u201d ''Regul. Toxicol. Pharmacol.'', vol. 29, no. 1, pp. 88\u201395, 1999.</ref> \n* '''Synergistic toxicity'''   \nDifferent [[triazine]] [[herbicide]]s appear to have a synergistic effect on specific [[Species|animal species]]. In the case of cyanazine, [[atrazine]] can cause effects on non-target species like Chironomus tentans. [[Atrazine]] is able to influence the activity of [[Cytochrome P450|P450]] enzymes in midges and therefore cause increased [[toxicity]] of these [[herbicide]]s.<ref>Y. Jin-Clark, M. J. Lydy, and K. Y. Zhu, \u201cEffects of atrazine and cyanazine on chlorpyrifos toxicity in Chironomus tentans (Diptera: Chironomidae),\u201d ''Environ.

In 539, the [[Ostrogoths]] conquered and destroyed Milan during the [[Gothic War (535\u2013554)|Gothic War]] against [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] Emperor [[Justinian I]]. In the summer of 569 the [[Lombards]] (from which the name of the Italian region [[Lombardy]] derives), conquered Milan, overpowering the small [[Byzantine army|Byzantine garrison]] left for its defence.

It did not take long, however, for the City States to begin fighting each other to try to limit neighbouring powers.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.turismo.milano.it/wps/portal/tur/en/arteecultura/storia|title=Milan: a history of greatness, from its origins to the twentieth century|website=Portale per il Turismo del Comune di Milano|language=en|access-date=15 May 2017}}</ref> The Milanese destroyed Lodi and continuously warred with Pavia, Cremona and Como, who in turn asked the Emperor of Germany, Frederick I Barbarossa for help. This brought the destruction of much of Milan in 1162. A fire destroyed the storehouses containing the entire food supply, and within just a few days Milan was forced to surrender.\n\nA period of peace followed and Milan prospered as a centre of trade due to its position. As a result of the independence that the Lombard cities gained in the [[Peace of Constance]] in 1183, Milan became a duchy. In 1447 [[Filippo Maria Visconti]], [[List of rulers of Milan|Duke of Milan]], died without a male heir; following the end of the Visconti line, the [[Golden Ambrosian Republic|Ambrosian Republic]] was established; it took its name from St. Ambrose, the popular patron saint of the city.<ref name=\"lucas:268\">Henry S.

The king's cousin, [[Louis XII|Louis of Orl\u00e9ans]], took part in the expedition and realized Italy was virtually defenseless. This prompted him to [[Italian Wars|come back a few years later]] in 1500, and claim the Duchy of Milan for himself, his grandmother having been a member of the ruling [[Visconti of Milan|Visconti]] family. At that time, Milan was also defended by [[Swiss mercenaries]]. After the victory of Louis's successor Fran\u00e7ois I over the Swiss at the [[Battle of Marignan]], the duchy was promised to the French king [[Fran\u00e7ois I of France|Fran\u00e7ois I]]. When the Spanish Habsburg Emperor [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]] defeated Fran\u00e7ois I at the [[Battle of Pavia]] in 1525, [[northern Italy]], including Milan, passed to [[Hapsburg Spain|Habsburg Spain]].<ref>John Lothrop Motley, ''The Rise of the Dutch Republic'' Vol. II (Harper Bros.: New York, 1855) p. 2.</ref>\n\nIn 1556, Charles V abdicated in favour of his son [[Philip II of Spain|Philip II]] and his brother [[Ferdinand I, Holy Roman Emperor|Ferdinand I]]. Charles's Italian possessions, including Milan, passed to Philip II and remained with the Spanish line of Habsburgs, while Ferdinand's Austrian line of Habsburgs ruled the Holy Roman Empire. The [[Italian plague of 1629\u20131631|Great Plague of Milan]] in 1629\u201331, that claimed the lives of an estimated 60,000 people out of a population of 130,000, caused unprecedented devastation in the city and was effectively described by [[Alessandro Manzoni]] in his masterpiece \"[[The Betrothed (Manzoni novel)|The Betrothed]]\". This episode was seen by many as the symbol of Spanish bad rule and decadence and is considered one of the last outbreaks of the centuries-long [[pandemic]] of plague that began with the [[Black Death]].<ref>Cipolla, Carlo M. ''Fighting the Plague in Seventeenth Century Italy''. Madison: University of Wisconsin Press, 1981.</ref>\n\nIn 1700 the Spanish line of Habsburgs was extinguished with the death of [[Charles II of Spain|Charles II]]. After his death, the [[War of the Spanish Succession]] began in 1701 with the occupation of all Spanish possessions by French troops backing the claim of the French [[Philip V of Spain|Philippe of Anjou]] to the Spanish throne. In 1706, the French were defeated in [[Battle of Ramillies|Ramillies]] and [[Siege of Turin|Turin]] and were forced to yield northern Italy to the [[Habsburg Monarchy|Austrian Habsburgs]]. In 1713\u20131714 the Treaties of [[Treaty of Utrecht|Utrecht]] and [[Treaty of Rastatt|Rastatt]] formally confirmed Austrian sovereignty over most of Habsburg Spain's Italian possessions including [[Lombardy]] and its capital, Milan.\n\n===Late modern and contemporary===\n\n[[File:Cinque giornate di Milano.jpg|thumb|Popular print depicting the \"[[Five Days of Milan|Five Days]]\" uprising against Austrian rule.]]\n\nOn March 18th, 1848 Milan efficaciously rebelled against Austrian rule, during the so-called \"[[Five Days of Milan|Five Days]]\" ({{lang-it|Le Cinque Giornate}}), that forced Field Marshal [[Joseph Radetzky von Radetz|Radetzky]] to temporarily withdraw from the city. The bordering kingdom of [[Kingdom of Sardinia|Piedmont-Sardinia]] sent troops in order to protect the insurgents and organsied a [[plebiscite]] that ratified by a huge majority the unification of Lombardy with Piedmont-Sardinia. But just a few months later the Austrians were able to send fresh forces that routed the Piedmontese army at the [[Battle of Custoza (1848)|Battle of Custoza]] on 24 July and to reassert Austrian control over northern Italy.  About ten years later, however, Italian nationalist politicians, officers and intellectuals such as Cavour, Garibaldi and Mazzini were able to gather a huge consensus and to pressure the monarchy to forge an alliance with the new [[Second French Empire|French Empire]] of [[Napoleon III]] in order to defeat Austria and establish a large Italian state in the region. At the [[Battle of Solferino]] in 1859 French and Italian troops heavily defeated the Austrians that retreated under the [[Quadrilatero|Quadrilateral line]].<ref name=\"Solferino\">{{cite web|title=Solferino |author=Graham J.

A dense rail network, whose construction had started under Austrian patronage, was completed in a brief time, making Milan the rail hub of northern Italy and, with the opening of the [[Gotthard Rail Tunnel|Gotthard]] (1882) and [[Simplon Tunnel|Simplon]] (1906) railway tunnels, the major South European rail hub for goods and passenger transport. Indeed, Milan and Venice were among the main stops of the [[Orient Express]] that started operating from 1919. Abundant hydroelectric resources allowed the development of a strong steel and textile sector and, as Milanese banks dominated Italy's financial sphere, the city became the country's leading financial centre. Very rapid industrialization in the last two decades of the 1800s led to the birth of a massive worker class as well as bitter social conflicts. In May 1898 Milan was shaken by the [[Bava Beccaris massacre]], a riot related to soaring cost of living. \n\n[[File:Milano, Galleria Vittorio Emanuele II (bombardata) 02.jpg|left|thumb|[[Galleria Vittorio Emanuele II]] destroyed by [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] bombings, 1943.]]\n[[File:MI-Milano-1961-piazza-Duca-d-Aosta.jpg|thumb|[[Pirelli Tower]], here in a 1961 picture, became the symbol of the modernity and audacity of the [[Italian economic miracle]].]]\n\nMilan's economic dominance in Italy secured also a leading role for the city on the political scene.

The great [[Galleria Vittorio Emanuele II]], realised by [[Giuseppe Mengoni]] between 1865 and 1877 to celebrate [[Victor Emmanuel II of Italy|Vittorio Emanuele II]], is a covered passage with a glass and cast iron roof, inspired by the [[Burlington Arcade]] in London.

The [[Triennale]] is a design museum and events venue located in Palazzo dell'Arte, in Sempione Park. It hosts exhibitions and events highlighting contemporary Italian design, urban planning, architecture, music, and media arts, emphasising the relationship between art and industry.\n\nMilan in the 20th century was the epicentre of the [[Futurism|Futurist]] artistic movement. [[Filippo Tommaso Marinetti|Filippo Marinetti]], the founder of Italian [[Futurism]] wrote in his 1909 \"''[[Manifesto of Futurism]]''\" (in Italian, ''Manifesto Futuristico''), that Milan was \"''grande...tradizionale e futurista''\" (\"''grand...traditional and futuristic''\", in English). [[Umberto Boccioni]] was also an important [[Futurism]] artist who worked in the city. Today, Milan remains a major international hub of modern and contemporary art, with numerous modern art galleries.

The [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] found here a fertile ground. [[Cesare Beccaria|Cesare, Marquis of Beccaria]], with his famous ''[[Dei delitti e delle pene]]'', and Count [[Pietro Verri]], with the periodical ''Il Caff\u00e8'' were able to exert a considerable influence over the new [[middle class|middle-class]] culture, thanks also to an open-minded Austrian administration.\n\nIn the first years of the 19th century, the ideals of the [[Romanticism|Romantic movement]] made their impact on the cultural life of the city and its major writers debated the primacy of Classical versus [[Romantic poetry]]. Here, too, [[Giuseppe Parini]], and [[Ugo Foscolo]] published their most important works, and were admired by younger poets as masters of ethics, as well as of literary craftsmanship. Foscolo's poem ''[[Dei sepolcri]]'' was inspired by a Napoleonic law that\u2014against the will of many of its inhabitants\u2014was being extended to the city.\n\nIn the third decade of the 19th century, [[Alessandro Manzoni]] wrote his novel ''[[The Betrothed (Manzoni novel)|I Promessi Sposi]]'', considered the manifesto of Italian Romanticism, which found in Milan its centre; in the same period [[Carlo Porta]], reputed the most renowned local vernacular poet, wrote his poems in [[Lombard Language]]. The periodical ''[[Il Conciliatore]]'' published articles by [[Silvio Pellico]], [[Giovanni Berchet]], [[Ludovico di Breme]], who were both Romantic in poetry and patriotic in politics.\n\nAfter the [[Italian unification|Unification of Italy]] in 1861, Milan lost its political importance; nevertheless it retained a sort of central position in cultural debates. New ideas and movements from other countries of Europe were accepted and discussed: thus [[Realism (arts)|Realism]] and [[Naturalism (literature)|Naturalism]] gave birth to an Italian movement, ''[[Verismo]]''. The greatest ''verista'' novelist, [[Giovanni Verga]], was born in Sicily but wrote his most important books in Milan.\n\nIn addition to Italian, approximately 2 million people in the Milan metropolitan area can speak the [[Milanese dialect]] or one of its [[Western dialects of Lombard language|Western Lombard]] variations.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Coluzzi|first1=Paolo|title=Minority language planning and micronationalism in Italy : an analysis of the situation of Friulian, Cimbrian and Western Lombard with reference to Spanish minority languages|date=2007|publisher=New York|location=Oxford|isbn=978-3039110414|page=260}}</ref>\n\n=== Media ===\nMilan is an important national and international media centre. ''[[Corriere della Sera]]'', founded in 1876, is one of the oldest Italian newspapers, and it is published by [[RCS MediaGroup|Rizzoli]], as well as ''[[La Gazzetta dello Sport]]'', a daily dedicated to coverage of various sports and currently considered the most widely read daily newspaper in Italy.\nOther local dailies are the general broadsheets ''[[Il Giorno (newspaper)|Il Giorno]]'', ''[[Il Giornale]]'', the Roman Catholic Church-owned ''[[Avvenire]]'', and ''[[Il Sole 24 Ore]]'', a daily business newspaper owned by [[Confindustria]] (the Italian employers' federation). Free daily newspapers include ''[[Leggo]]'' and ''[[Metro Newspapers|Metro]]''.\nMilan is also home to many architecture, art, and fashion periodicals, including ''[[Abitare]]'', ''[[Casabella]]'', ''[[Domus]]'', ''[[Flash Art]]'', ''[[Gioia (magazine)|Gioia]]'', ''[[Grazia]]'', and ''[[Vogue Italia]]''. ''[[Panorama]]'' and ''[[Oggi]]'', two of Italy's most important weekly news magazines, are also published in Milan.\n\nSeveral commercial broadcast television networks have their national headquarters in the Milan conurbation, including [[Mediaset]] Group (owner of [[Canale 5]], [[Italia 1]], [[Iris (TV channel)|Iris]] and [[Rete 4]]), [[Telelombardia]] and [[MTV Italy]]. National radio stations based in Milan include [[Radio Deejay]], [[Radio 105 Network]], [[R101 (Italy)]], [[Radio Popolare]], [[RTL 102.5]], [[Radio Capital]] and [[Virgin Radio Italia]].\n\n=== Cuisine ===\n{{main article|Lombard cuisine}}\n[[File:Panettone - Nicolettone 2017 - IMG 7085 (31752542285).jpg|thumb|left|''[[Panettone]]'' is Milan's traditional Christmas cake.]]\n[[File:GorgonzolaDSC4233.jpg|thumb|''[[Gorgonzola]]'' is a veined Milanese blue cheese.]]\nLike most cities in Italy, Milan has developed its own local culinary tradition, which, as it is typical for North Italian cuisines, uses more frequently [[rice]] than [[pasta]], [[butter]] than [[vegetable oil]] and features almost no [[tomato]] or [[Fish as food|fish]]. Milanese traditional dishes includes ''[[cotoletta|cotoletta alla milanese]],'' a breaded veal (pork and turkey can be used) cutlet pan-fried in butter (similar to Viennese [[Wiener Schnitzel]]).

The ''salame Milano'', a [[salami]] with a very fine grain, is widespread throughout Italy.

Maximian built several gigantic monuments, the large [[Circus (building)|circus]] (470 \u00d7 85 metres), the ''[[thermae]]'' or \"Baths of Hercules\", a large complex of imperial palaces and other services and buildings of which fewer visible traces remain.

In 539, the [[Ostrogoths]] conquered and destroyed Milan during the [[Gothic War (535\u2013554)|Gothic War]] against [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] Emperor [[Justinian I]]. In the summer of 569 the [[Lombards]] (from which the name of the Italian region [[Lombardy]] derives), conquered Milan, overpowering the small [[Byzantine army|Byzantine garrison]] left for its defence. Some Roman structures remained in use in Milan under Lombard rule.<ref>See the ''[[Laudes Mediolanensis civitatis]]''.</ref> Milan surrendered to [[Charlemagne]] and the [[Franks]] in 774.\n\nThe 11th century saw a reaction against the control of the German emperors.

It did not take long, however, for the City States to begin fighting each other to try to limit neighbouring powers.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.turismo.milano.it/wps/portal/tur/en/arteecultura/storia|title=Milan: a history of greatness, from its origins to the twentieth century|website=Portale per il Turismo del Comune di Milano|language=en|access-date=15 May 2017}}</ref> The Milanese destroyed Lodi and continuously warred with Pavia, Cremona and Como, who in turn asked the Emperor of Germany, Frederick I Barbarossa for help. This brought the destruction of much of Milan in 1162. A fire destroyed the storehouses containing the entire food supply, and within just a few days Milan was forced to surrender.\n\nA period of peace followed and Milan prospered as a centre of trade due to its position. As a result of the independence that the Lombard cities gained in the [[Peace of Constance]] in 1183, Milan became a duchy. In 1447 [[Filippo Maria Visconti]], [[List of rulers of Milan|Duke of Milan]], died without a male heir; following the end of the Visconti line, the [[Golden Ambrosian Republic|Ambrosian Republic]] was established; it took its name from St. Ambrose, the popular patron saint of the city.<ref name=\"lucas:268\">Henry S.

The king's cousin, [[Louis XII|Louis of Orl\u00e9ans]], took part in the expedition and realized Italy was virtually defenseless. This prompted him to [[Italian Wars|come back a few years later]] in 1500, and claim the Duchy of Milan for himself, his grandmother having been a member of the ruling [[Visconti of Milan|Visconti]] family. At that time, Milan was also defended by [[Swiss mercenaries]]. After the victory of Louis's successor Fran\u00e7ois I over the Swiss at the [[Battle of Marignan]], the duchy was promised to the French king [[Fran\u00e7ois I of France|Fran\u00e7ois I]]. When the Spanish Habsburg Emperor [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]] defeated Fran\u00e7ois I at the [[Battle of Pavia]] in 1525, [[northern Italy]], including Milan, passed to [[Hapsburg Spain|Habsburg Spain]].<ref>John Lothrop Motley, ''The Rise of the Dutch Republic'' Vol. II (Harper Bros.: New York, 1855) p. 2.</ref>\n\nIn 1556, Charles V abdicated in favour of his son [[Philip II of Spain|Philip II]] and his brother [[Ferdinand I, Holy Roman Emperor|Ferdinand I]]. Charles's Italian possessions, including Milan, passed to Philip II and remained with the Spanish line of Habsburgs, while Ferdinand's Austrian line of Habsburgs ruled the Holy Roman Empire. The [[Italian plague of 1629\u20131631|Great Plague of Milan]] in 1629\u201331, that claimed the lives of an estimated 60,000 people out of a population of 130,000, caused unprecedented devastation in the city and was effectively described by [[Alessandro Manzoni]] in his masterpiece \"[[The Betrothed (Manzoni novel)|The Betrothed]]\". This episode was seen by many as the symbol of Spanish bad rule and decadence and is considered one of the last outbreaks of the centuries-long [[pandemic]] of plague that began with the [[Black Death]].<ref>Cipolla, Carlo M. ''Fighting the Plague in Seventeenth Century Italy''. Madison: University of Wisconsin Press, 1981.</ref>\n\nIn 1700 the Spanish line of Habsburgs was extinguished with the death of [[Charles II of Spain|Charles II]]. After his death, the [[War of the Spanish Succession]] began in 1701 with the occupation of all Spanish possessions by French troops backing the claim of the French [[Philip V of Spain|Philippe of Anjou]] to the Spanish throne. In 1706, the French were defeated in [[Battle of Ramillies|Ramillies]] and [[Siege of Turin|Turin]] and were forced to yield northern Italy to the [[Habsburg Monarchy|Austrian Habsburgs]]. In 1713\u20131714 the Treaties of [[Treaty of Utrecht|Utrecht]] and [[Treaty of Rastatt|Rastatt]] formally confirmed Austrian sovereignty over most of Habsburg Spain's Italian possessions including [[Lombardy]] and its capital, Milan.\n\n===Late modern and contemporary===\n\n[[File:Cinque giornate di Milano.jpg|thumb|Popular print depicting the \"[[Five Days of Milan|Five Days]]\" uprising against Austrian rule.]]\n\nOn March 18th, 1848 Milan efficaciously rebelled against Austrian rule, during the so-called \"[[Five Days of Milan|Five Days]]\" ({{lang-it|Le Cinque Giornate}}), that forced Field Marshal [[Joseph Radetzky von Radetz|Radetzky]] to temporarily withdraw from the city. The bordering kingdom of [[Kingdom of Sardinia|Piedmont-Sardinia]] sent troops in order to protect the insurgents and organsied a [[plebiscite]] that ratified by a huge majority the unification of Lombardy with Piedmont-Sardinia. But just a few months later the Austrians were able to send fresh forces that routed the Piedmontese army at the [[Battle of Custoza (1848)|Battle of Custoza]] on 24 July and to reassert Austrian control over northern Italy.  About ten years later, however, Italian nationalist politicians, officers and intellectuals such as Cavour, Garibaldi and Mazzini were able to gather a huge consensus and to pressure the monarchy to forge an alliance with the new [[Second French Empire|French Empire]] of [[Napoleon III]] in order to defeat Austria and estabilish a large Italian state in the region. At the [[Battle of Solferino]] in 1859 French and Italian troops heavily defeated the Austrians that retreated under the [[Quadrilatero|Quadrilateral line]].<ref name=\"Solferino\">{{cite web|title=Solferino |author=Graham J.

A dense rail network, whose construction had started under Austrian patronage, was completed in a brief time, making Milan the rail hub of northern Italy and, with the opening of the [[Gotthard Rail Tunnel|Gotthard]] (1882) and [[Simplon Tunnel|Simplon]] (1906) railway tunnels, the major South European rail hub for goods and passenger transport. Indeed, Milan and Venice were among the main stops of the [[Orient Express]] that started operating from 1919. Abundant hydroelectric resources allowed the development of a strong steel and textile sector and, as Milanese banks dominated Italy's financial sphere, the city became the country's leading financial centre. Very rapid industrialization in the last two decades of the 1800s led to the birth of a massive worker class as well as bitter social conflicts.

In the 1950s and 1960s, a strong demand for new residential and commercial areas drove to extreme urban expansion, that has produced some of the major milestones in the city's architectural history, including [[Gi\u00f2 Ponti|Gio Ponti]]'s [[Pirelli Tower]] (1956\u201360), [[Torre Velasca|Velasca Tower]] (1956\u201358), and the creation of brand new residential satellite towns, as well as huge amounts of low quality public housings. In recent years, de-industrialization, urban decay and gentrification led to a vast urban renewal of former industrial areas, that have been transformed into modern residential and financial districts, notably [[Porta Nuova (Milan)|Porta Nuova]] in downtown Milan and [[FieraMilano]] in the suburb of [[Rho (Italy)|Rho]]. In addition, the old exhibition area is being completely reshaped according to the [[CityLife (Milan)|Citylife]] regeneration project, featuring residencial areas, museums, an urban park and three skyscrapers designed by international architects, and after whom they are named: the {{convert|202|m|adj=mid|abbr=off}} [[Isozaki Arata]]\u2014when completed, the tallest building in Italy,<ref name=\"Isozaki Tower Citylife\"/> the twisted [[Zaha Hadid|Hadid Tower]],<ref name=\"Hadid Tower Citylife\"/> and the curved [[Daniel Libeskind|Libeskind Tower]].<ref name=\"Liebskind Tower Citylife\"/>\n\n=== Parks and gardens ===\n[[File:Parco Sempione Milano.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Parco Sempione|Sempione Park]] and the [[Porta Sempione|Arch of Peace]].]]\n\nThe largest parks in the central area of Milan are [[Parco Sempione|Sempione Park]], at the north-western edge, and [[Giardini Pubblici Indro Montanelli|Montanelli Gardens]], situated northeast of the city.

The [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] found here a fertile ground. [[Cesare Beccaria|Cesare, Marquis of Beccaria]], with his famous ''[[Dei delitti e delle pene]]'', and Count [[Pietro Verri]], with the periodical ''Il Caff\u00e8'' were able to exert a considerable influence over the new [[middle class|middle-class]] culture, thanks also to an open-minded Austrian administration.\n\nIn the first years of the 19th century, the ideals of the [[Romanticism|Romantic movement]] made their impact on the cultural life of the city and its major writers debated the primacy of Classical versus [[Romantic poetry]]. Here, too, [[Giuseppe Parini]], and [[Ugo Foscolo]] published their most important works, and were admired by younger poets as masters of ethics, as well as of literary craftsmanship. Foscolo's poem ''[[Dei sepolcri]]'' was inspired by a Napoleonic law that\u2014against the will of many of its inhabitants\u2014was being extended to the city.\n\nIn the third decade of the 19th century, [[Alessandro Manzoni]] wrote his novel ''[[The Betrothed (Manzoni novel)|I Promessi Sposi]]'', considered the manifesto of Italian Romanticism, which found in Milan its centre; in the same period [[Carlo Porta]], reputed the most renowned local vernacular poet, wrote his poems in [[Lombard Language]]. The periodical ''[[Il Conciliatore]]'' published articles by [[Silvio Pellico]], [[Giovanni Berchet]], [[Ludovico di Breme]], who were both Romantic in poetry and patriotic in politics.\n\nAfter the [[Italian unification|Unification of Italy]] in 1861, Milan lost its political importance; nevertheless it retained a sort of central position in cultural debates. New ideas and movements from other countries of Europe were accepted and discussed: thus [[Realism (arts)|Realism]] and [[Naturalism (literature)|Naturalism]] gave birth to an Italian movement, ''[[Verismo]]''. The greatest ''verista'' novelist, [[Giovanni Verga]], was born in Sicily but wrote his most important books in Milan.\n\nIn addition to Italian, approximately 2 million people in the Milan metropolitan area can speak the [[Milanese dialect]] or one of its [[Western dialects of Lombard language|Western Lombard]] variations.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Coluzzi|first1=Paolo|title=Minority language planning and micronationalism in Italy : an analysis of the situation of Friulian, Cimbrian and Western Lombard with reference to Spanish minority languages|date=2007|publisher=New York|location=Oxford|isbn=978-3039110414|page=260}}</ref>\n\n=== Media ===\nMilan is an important national and international media centre. ''[[Corriere della Sera]]'', founded in 1876, is one of the oldest Italian newspapers, and it is published by [[RCS MediaGroup|Rizzoli]], as well as ''[[La Gazzetta dello Sport]]'', a daily dedicated to coverage of various sports and currently considered the most widely read daily newspaper in Italy.\nOther local dailies are the general broadsheets ''[[Il Giorno (newspaper)|Il Giorno]]'', ''[[Il Giornale]]'', the Roman Catholic Church-owned ''[[Avvenire]]'', and ''[[Il Sole 24 Ore]]'', a daily business newspaper owned by [[Confindustria]] (the Italian employers' federation).

It is a polymer of [[isoprene]] which forms a rubber-like [[elastomer]].\n\nThe word ''gutta-percha'' comes from the plant's name in [[Malay language|Malay]]: ''getah'' translates as '[[latex]]'. ''Percha'' or ''perca'' is an older name for [[Sumatra]].\n\n==Description==\n[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM Guttapercha-boom TMnr 60016733.jpg|thumb|Gutta-percha tree]]\n\nPalaquium gutta trees are {{convert|5|\u2013|30|m|-1}} tall and up to {{convert|1|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} in trunk diameter. The leaves are [[evergreen]], alternate or spirally arranged, simple, entire, {{convert|8|\u2013|25|cm|in|0|abbr=on}} long, glossy green above, and often yellow or glaucous below. The flowers are produced in small clusters along the stems, each flower with a white [[corolla (flower)|corolla]] with four to seven (mostly six) acute lobes. The fruit is an ovoid {{convert|3|\u2013|7|cm|in|0|abbr=on}} berry, containing one to four seeds; in many species, the fruit is edible.\n\nIn Australia, gutta-percha is a common name specifically used for the [[euphorbiaceae|euphorbiaceous]] tree ''[[Excoecaria]] parvifolia'', which yields an aromatic, heavy, dark-brown timber.\n\n==Chemistry==\n[[File:Guttapercha.svg|thumb|Chemical structure of gutta-percha]]\n\nChemically, gutta-percha is a [[terpene|polyterpene]], a [[polymer]] of [[isoprene]], or [[polyisoprene]], specifically ([[cis-trans isomerism|trans]]-1,4-polyisoprene). The [[Cis-trans isomerism|cis]] structure of polyisoprene is the common [[latex]] [[elastomer]].

The first European to discover this material was John Tradescant, who collected it in the far east in 1656. He named this material \"Mazer wood\". Dr. William Montgomerie, a medical officer in Indian service, introduced gutta-percha into practical use in the West. He was the first to appreciate the potential of this material in medicine, and he was awarded the gold medal by the Royal Society of Arts, London in 1843.<ref name=prakesh>Harvey Wickes Felter and John Uri Lloyd.

Allowing this fluid to evaporate and coagulate in the sun produced a latex which could be made flexible again with hot water, but which did not become brittle, unlike [[rubber]] prior to the discovery of [[vulcanized|vulcanization]].{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}\n\nBy 1845, telegraph wires insulated with gutta-percha were being manufactured in the UK.

However, both NBC News and MSNBC are shown for a few hours a day on [[OSN News]] in [[MENA]] Region.\n\nMSNBC is also shown occasionally on sister network [[CNBC Europe]] during [[breaking news]], and Nightly News and Meet the Press are also shown regularly. ''NBC Nightly News'' is shown in the Philippines on [[9TV]] (formerly [[Talk TV (Philippines)|Talktv]] and [[Solar News Channel]]), while ''Early Today'' was officially dropped from the network in December 2013, but they replaced by the repeats of [[Inside Edition]]. ''NBC Nightly News'', along with the full program lineup of NBC, was carried by affiliate [[VSB-TV]] in Bermuda.\n\nThe [[Seven Network]] in [[Australia]] has close ties with NBC and has used a majority of the network's imaging and slogans since the 1970s. ''[[Seven News]]'' has featured ''[[The Mission (theme music)|The Mission]]'' as its news theme since the mid-1980s. Local newscasts were named ''Seven Nightly News'' from the mid-1980s until around 2000. NBC and Seven will often share news recourses between the two countries. NBC News has been known to use Seven News reporters for live reports on a developing news story in Australia. Seven News will sometimes also incorporate an NBC News report into its national bulletins. ''Today'', ''Weekend Today'' and ''Meet The Press'' are all broadcast on the [[Seven Network]] during the early morning hours from 3-5 a.m., just before Seven's own morning show ''[[Sunrise (Australian TV program)|Sunrise]]''.\n\nIn [[Hong Kong]], ''[[NBC Nightly News]]'' is [[live television|live digital television broadcast transmission]] (or [[broadcast delay|delayed]]) on [[TVB Pearl]] daily from 07:00 until 08:00 [[Hong Kong Time]] (18:00 until 19:00 [[Eastern Standard Time (North America)|New York City Time]]).\n\nIn the [[United Kingdom]], the [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] network, used to air segments from ''NBC Nightly News'' on their ''[[ITV News at 5:30]]'' morning newscast before it was cancelled in December 2012.

The station used a series of relays from Philadelphia to New York and on to upper [[New York State]], for rebroadcast on W2XB in [[Schenectady, New York|Schenectady]] (now [[WRGB]]), making this among the first \"network\" programs of NBC Television. Due to wartime and technical restrictions, there were no live telecasts of the 1944 conventions, although films of the events were reportedly shown over WNBT the next day.\n\nAbout this time, there were irregularly scheduled, quasi-network newscasts originating from NBC's WNBT in New York City, ([[WNBC]]), and reportedly fed to WPTZ (now [[KYW-TV]]) in Philadelphia and [[WRGB]] in Schenectady, NY. Such as, [[Esso]] sponsored news features a well as ''[[The War As It Happens]]'' in the final days of [[World War II]], another irregularly scheduled [[NBC]] television newsreel program which was also seen in New York, Philadelphia and Schenectady on the relatively few (roughly 5000) television sets which existed at the time. After the war, ''[[NBC Television Newsreel]]'' aired filmed news highlights with narration. Later in 1948, when sponsored by [[Camel (cigarette)|Camel Cigarettes]], ''[[NBC Television Newsreel]]'' was renamed ''[[Camel Newsreel Theatre]]'' and then, when [[John Cameron Swayze]] was added as an on-camera anchor in 1949, the program was renamed ''[[Camel News Caravan]]''.\n\nIn 1948, NBC teamed up with ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' magazine to provide election night coverage of President [[Harry S. Truman]]'s surprising victory over New York governor [[Thomas E. Dewey]]. The television audience was small, but NBC's share in New York was double that of any other outlet.<ref>[http://www.tvobscurities.com/2009/02/new-york-city-hooper-ratings-for-election-night-1948/ \"New York City Hooper Ratings for Election Night 1948\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090302083754/http://www.tvobscurities.com/2009/02/new-york-city-hooper-ratings-for-election-night-1948/ |date=March 2, 2009 }} TVObscurities.com.</ref> The following year, the ''[[Camel News Caravan]]'', anchored by [[John Cameron Swayze]], debuted on NBC.

In an era when space missions rated continuous coverage, NBC configured its largest studio, [[NBC Radio City Studios|Studio 8H]], for space coverage. It utilized models and mockups of rockets and spacecraft, maps of the earth and moon to show orbital trackage, and stages on which animated figures created by puppeteer [[Bil Baird]] were used to depict movements of astronauts before on-board spacecraft television cameras were feasible.

However, both NBC News and MSNBC are shown for a few hours a day on [[OSN News]] in [[MENA]] Region.\n\nMSNBC is also shown occasionally on sister network [[CNBC Europe]] during [[breaking news]], and Nightly News and Meet the Press are also shown regularly. ''NBC Nightly News'' is shown in the Philippines on [[9TV]] (formerly [[Talk TV (Philippines)|Talktv]] and [[Solar News Channel]]), while ''Early Today'' was officially dropped from the network in December 2013, but they replaced by the repeats of [[Inside Edition]]. ''NBC Nightly News'', along with the full program lineup of NBC, was carried by affiliate [[VSB-TV]] in Bermuda.\n\nThe [[Seven Network]] in [[Australia]] has close ties with NBC and has used a majority of the network's imaging and slogans since the 1970s. ''[[Seven News]]'' has featured ''[[The Mission (theme music)|The Mission]]'' as its news theme since the mid-1980s. Local newscasts were named ''Seven Nightly News'' from the mid-1980s until around 2000. NBC and Seven will often share news recourses between the two countries. NBC News has been known to use Seven News reporters for live reports on a developing news story in Australia. Seven News will sometimes also incorporate an NBC News report into its national bulletins. ''Today'', ''Weekend Today'' and ''Meet The Press'' are all broadcast on the [[Seven Network]] during the early morning hours from 3-5 a.m., just before Seven's own morning show ''[[Sunrise (Australian TV program)|Sunrise]]''.\n\nIn [[Hong Kong]], ''[[NBC Nightly News]]'' is [[live television|live digital television broadcast transmission]] (or [[broadcast delay|delayed]]) on [[TVB Pearl]] daily from 07:00 until 08:00 [[Hong Kong Time]] (18:00 until 19:00 [[Eastern Standard Time (North America)|New York City Time]]).\n\nIn the [[United Kingdom]], the [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] network, used to air segments from ''NBC Nightly News'' on their ''[[ITV News at 5:30]]'' morning newscast before it was cancelled in December 2012. NBC News share facilities and crew in the UK with [[ITN]], who is the news provider for ITV.\n\n==Theme music==\nMost of NBC's news television programs use \"[[The Mission (theme song)|The Mission]]\" by [[John Williams]] as their theme. The composition was first used by NBC in 1985 and was updated in 2004.<ref>{{cite web|author=Submitted by NBC Universal|url=http://www.soundtrack.net/news/article/?id=822|title=SoundtrackNet: News: Legendary Composer John Williams Composes New \"NBC Sunday Night Football\" Theme|publisher=[[Soundtrack.net]]|date=August 30, 2006|accessdate=November 27, 2011|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111021032305/http://www.soundtrack.net/news/article/?id=822|archivedate=October 21, 2011|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{Official website}}\n\n{{White House James S.

Issued nearly five years after her previous album, the internationally successful ''[[21 (Adele album)|21]]'' (2011), the album is titled as a reflection of her life and frame of mind at 25 years old and is termed a \"make-up record\". Its lyrical content features themes of Adele \"yearning for her old self, her nostalgia\", and \"melancholia about the passage of time\" according to an interview with the singer by ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', as well as themes of motherhood and regret. In contrast to Adele's previous works, the production of ''25'' incorporated the use of electronic elements and creative rhythmic patterns, with elements of 1980s [[Contemporary R&B|R&B]] and organs. Like when recording ''21'', Adele worked with producer and songwriter [[Paul Epworth]] and [[Ryan Tedder]], along with new collaborations with [[Max Martin]] and [[Shellback (record producer)|Shellback]], [[Greg Kurstin]], [[Danger Mouse (musician)|Danger Mouse]], [[the Smeezingtons]], [[Samuel Dixon]], and [[Tobias Jesso Jr]].\n\nUpon its release, ''25'' received generally positive reviews from critics, who commended Adele's vocal performance and the album's production. It was a massive commercial success, debuting at number one in 32 countries and [[List of fastest-selling albums|breaking first-week sales records]] in multiple countries, including the United Kingdom and United States. In the US, the album sold over 3.38 million copies in its first week of sales, marking the largest single-week sales for an album since [[Nielsen SoundScan]] began tracking point-of-sale music purchases in 1991. ''25'' eventually became the [[List of best-selling albums#Best-selling album by year worldwide|world's best-selling album of the year]] for 2015, with 17.4 million copies sold within the year,<ref name=\"IFPI\">{{cite web|title=Global Music Report|url=http://www.ifpi.org/downloads/GMR2016.pdf|publisher=[[International Federation of the Phonographic Industry]]|accessdate=12 April 2016}}</ref> and has gone on to sell over 22 million copies worldwide, making it one of the [[List of best-selling albums|best-selling albums of all time]], and the [[List of best-selling albums of the 21st century|fourth-best selling album of the 21st century]]. Following ''21'', it was [[RIAA certification|certified Diamond]] by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA), denoting equivalent sales of 10 million copies in the US, making Adele the only artist of the 2010s to achieve this certification with two albums.\n\nGlobally, ''25'' was the biggest-selling music release in 2015 and 2016, with many journalists crediting it with impacting the music industry by encouraging a renewed interest in buying physical releases rather than downloading or streaming; much like ''21'', it was also credited for saving the dwindling sales of the UK and US music industry. ''25'' received the [[Brit Awards|BRIT Award]] for [[Brit Award for British Album of the Year|British Album of the Year]], while its lead single \"[[Hello (Adele song)|Hello]]\" won [[Brit Award for British Single of the Year|British Single of the Year]] at the [[2016 Brit Awards]]. It also won the [[2017 Grammy Awards]] for [[Grammy Award for Album of the Year|Album of the Year]], and [[Grammy Award for Best Pop Vocal Album|Best Pop Vocal Album]]; \"Hello\" also won Grammys for [[Grammy Award for Record of the Year|Record of the Year]], [[Grammy Award for Song of the Year|Song of the Year]], and [[Grammy Award for Best Pop Solo Performance|Best Pop Solo Performance]]. To promote the album, Adele embarked on her third worldwide concert tour, [[Adele Live 2016]]. It started on 29 February 2016 and ended on 30 June 2017.\n\n==Background==\n\nFollowing the release of ''[[21 (Adele album)|21]]'' (2011), Adele was considering quitting music.

Issued nearly five years after her previous album, the internationally successful ''[[21 (Adele album)|21]]'' (2011), the album is titled as a reflection of her life and frame of mind at 25 years old and is termed a \"make-up record\". Its lyrical content features themes of Adele \"yearning for her old self, her nostalgia\", and \"melancholia about the passage of time\" according to an interview with the singer by ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', as well as themes of motherhood and regret. In contrast to Adele's previous works, the production of ''25'' incorporated the use of electronic elements and creative rhythmic patterns, with elements of 1980s [[Contemporary R&B|R&B]] and organs. Like when recording ''21'', Adele worked with producer and songwriter [[Paul Epworth]] and [[Ryan Tedder]], along with new collaborations with [[Max Martin]] and [[Shellback (record producer)|Shellback]], [[Greg Kurstin]], [[Danger Mouse (musician)|Danger Mouse]], [[the Smeezingtons]], [[Samuel Dixon]], and [[Tobias Jesso Jr]].\n\nUpon its release, ''25'' received generally positive reviews from critics, who commended Adele's vocal performance and the album's production. It was a massive commercial success, debuting at number one in 32 countries and [[List of fastest-selling albums|breaking first-week sales records]] in multiple countries, including the United Kingdom and United States. In the US, the album sold over 3.38 million copies in its first week of sales, marking the largest single-week sales for an album since [[Nielsen SoundScan]] began tracking point-of-sale music purchases in 1991. ''25'' eventually became the [[List of best-selling albums#Best-selling album by year worldwide|world's best-selling album of the year]] for 2015, with 17.4 million copies sold within the year,<ref name=\"IFPI\">{{cite web|title=Global Music Report|url=http://www.ifpi.org/downloads/GMR2016.pdf|publisher=[[International Federation of the Phonographic Industry]]|accessdate=12 April 2016}}</ref> and has gone on to sell over 22 million copies worldwide, making it one of the [[List of best-selling albums|best-selling albums of all time]], and the [[List of best-selling albums of the 21st century|fourth-best selling album of the 21st century]]. Following ''21'', it was [[RIAA certification|certified Diamond]] by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA), denoting equivalent sales of 10 million copies in the US, making Adele the only artist of the 2010s to achieve this certification with two albums.\n\nGlobally, ''25'' was the biggest-selling music release in 2015 and 2016, with many journalists crediting it with impacting the music industry by encouraging a renewed interest in buying physical releases rather than downloading or streaming; much like ''21'', it was also credited for saving the dwindling sales of the UK and US music industry. ''25'' received the [[Brit Awards|BRIT Award]] for [[Brit Award for British Album of the Year|British Album of the Year]], while its lead single \"[[Hello (Adele song)|Hello]]\" won [[Brit Award for British Single of the Year|British Single of the Year]] at the [[2016 Brit Awards]]. It also won the [[2017 Grammy Awards]] for [[Grammy Award for Album of the Year|Album of the Year]], and [[Grammy Award for Best Pop Vocal Album|Best Pop Vocal Album]]; \"Hello\" also won Grammys for [[Grammy Award for Record of the Year|Record of the Year]], [[Grammy Award for Song of the Year|Song of the Year]], and [[Grammy Award for Best Pop Solo Performance|Best Pop Solo Performance]]. To promote the album, Adele embarked on her third worldwide concert tour, [[Adele Live 2016]]. It started on 29 February 2016 and ended on 30 June 2017.\n\n==Background==\n\nFollowing the release of ''[[21 (Adele album)|21]]'' (2011), Adele was considering quitting music.

Each province elects between two and nine representatives, and these representatives are members of political parties.  There are 111 members of the National Assembly elected to represent provinces, and 16 nationally elected, totaling 127.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=http://sahelresearch.africa.ufl.edu/tsep/themesissues/the-electoral-system/burkina-faso/|title=Sahel Research Group {{!}} Burkina Faso|website=sahelresearch.africa.ufl.edu|access-date=2016-05-03}}</ref>\n\nIn Burkina Faso, the National Assembly is elected by a proportional representational system.<ref name=\":0\" /> Proportional representation in Burkina Faso means that each person marks one party on the ballot, and after tallying the votes, the top parties chosen are elected to the Assembly. Each electoral province has a simple electoral quotient. This is the number of valid votes counted divided by the number of seats available. If a party wins a seat by the electoral quotient, usually half of the votes, then the remainder of the seats are transferred to a \"rest\" category, which are compared to the other votes gathered.  For example, in the province of Boulkiemde, the MPP received 29,445 votes, which is 35.1% of the total votes of the province.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ceni.bf/sites/default/files/Legislatives2015/BOULKIEMDE.pdf|title=ELECTIONS LEGISLATIVES A CIRCONSCRIPTION PROVINCIALE|last=|first=|date=December 1, 2015|website=Ceni.gov|publisher=CENI|access-date=May 2, 2016}}</ref> Boulkiemde elects four representatives to their legislature, so their electoral quotient is 21002 votes (84007\u00f74). This means that the MPP will receive one seat from the electoral quotient. The remaining votes are transferred to another category, which is compared among the other candidates. These remaining votes in Boulkiemde won the MPP another seat in the legislature, since the remaining votes (8443) are the second highest compared to the rest of the parties (CDP=16968, UPC=8099). Thus, since the MPP received 35.1% of the votes, they received 50% of the seats due to the electoral quotient.\n\nElections are led by teachers in Burkina Faso, who are not allowed to be a member of any political party. &nbsp;The ballot has a name, acronym, or symbol of the party and a space for voters to mark.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=http://aceproject.org/main/english/vc/vca01.htm|title=Electoral Systems Counting Requirements \u2014|website=aceproject.org|access-date=2016-05-03}}</ref> The ballots are placed in envelopes, and then placed in ballot boxes.&nbsp;The leader of the election officials ensures that the seal is not broken before counting all of the votes. The teachers who are trained as election officials become counting officials.<ref name=\":1\" /> Invalid ballots include those that have no marks, more than one mark, or ballots not in an envelope.&nbsp; The ballots are sent to the district level after counting them, where the winner of a legislative seat will be determined based on the number of votes. The districts are divided by one seat per 100,000 people, so the capital, Ouagadougou, has nine seats.\n\n== 2015 National Assembly elections ==\nIn the 2015 parliamentary election, the People's Movement for Progress party received 51.3% of the national vote, winning 55 seats.

Each province elects between two and nine representatives, and these representatives are members of political parties.  There are 111 members of the National Assembly elected to represent provinces, and 16 nationally elected, totaling 127.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=http://sahelresearch.africa.ufl.edu/tsep/themesissues/the-electoral-system/burkina-faso/|title=Sahel Research Group {{!}} Burkina Faso|website=sahelresearch.africa.ufl.edu|access-date=2016-05-03}}</ref>\n\nIn Burkina Faso, the National Assembly is elected by a proportional representational system.<ref name=\":0\" /> Proportional representation in Burkina Faso means that each person marks one party on the ballot, and after tallying the votes, the top parties chosen are elected to the Assembly. Each electoral province has a simple electoral quotient. This is the number of valid votes counted divided by the number of seats available. If a party wins a seat by the electoral quotient, usually half of the votes, then the remainder of the seats are transferred to a \"rest\" category, which are compared to the other votes gathered.  For example, in the province of Boulkiemde, the MPP received 29,445 votes, which is 35.1% of the total votes of the province.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ceni.bf/sites/default/files/Legislatives2015/BOULKIEMDE.pdf|title=ELECTIONS LEGISLATIVES A CIRCONSCRIPTION PROVINCIALE|last=|first=|date=December 1, 2015|website=Ceni.gov|publisher=CENI|access-date=May 2, 2016}}</ref> Boulkiemde elects four representatives to their legislature, so their electoral quotient is 21002 votes (84007\u00f74). This means that the MPP will receive one seat from the electoral quotient. The remaining votes are transferred to another category, which is compared among the other candidates. These remaining votes in Boulkiemde won the MPP another seat in the legislature, since the remaining votes (8443) are the second highest compared to the rest of the parties (CDP=16968, UPC=8099). Thus, since the MPP received 35.1% of the votes, they received 50% of the seats due to the electoral quotient.\n\nElections are led by teachers in Burkina Faso, who are not allowed to be a member of any political party. &nbsp;The ballot has a name, acronym, or symbol of the party and a space for voters to mark.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=http://aceproject.org/main/english/vc/vca01.htm|title=Electoral Systems Counting Requirements \u2014|website=aceproject.org|access-date=2016-05-03}}</ref> The ballots are placed in envelopes, and then placed in ballot boxes.&nbsp;The leader of the election officials ensures that the seal is not broken before counting all of the votes. The teachers who are trained as election officials become counting officials.<ref name=\":1\" /> Invalid ballots include those that have no marks, more than one mark, or ballots not in an envelope.&nbsp; The ballots are sent to the district level after counting them, where the winner of a legislative seat will be determined based on the number of votes.

It is also the [[List of cities in Burkina Faso#10 largest cities|country's largest city]], with a population of 2,200,000 in 2015. The city's name is often shortened to ''Ouaga''. The inhabitants are called ''ouagalais''. The spelling of the name ''Ouagadougou'' is derived from the [[French orthography]] common in former [[French African colonies]].\n\nOuagadougou's primary industries are food processing and textiles. It is served by an [[Ouagadougou Airport|international airport]] and is linked by rail to [[Abidjan]] in the [[Ivory Coast]] and, for freight only, to [[Kaya, Burkina Faso|Kaya]]. There are several highways linking the city to [[Niamey]], [[Niger]], south to Ghana, and southwest to [[Ivory Coast]]. Ouagadougou has one of West Africa's largest markets, which burned down in 2003 and has since reopened with better facilities and improved fire-prevention measures. Other attractions include the National Museum of Burkina Faso, the Moro-Naba Palace (site of the [[Moro-Naba Ceremony]]), the [[National Museum of Music (Burkina Faso)|National Museum of Music]], and several craft markets.\n\n==History==\n{{see also|Timeline of Ouagadougou}}\n[[File:NE 1200ad.jpg|right|thumb|upright=1.4|Europe, Africa and the Near East in 1200, showing the [[Mossi Kingdoms|Kingdom of Wagadugu]] (in West Africa, just to the right of the area labeled '25') and its neighbors.]]\nThe name ''Ouagadougou'' dates back to the 15th century when the Ninsi tribes inhabited the area.<ref> Britannica, [https://www.britannica.com/place/Ouagadougou Ouagadougou], britannica.com, USA, accessed on July 7, 2019</ref> They were in constant conflict until 1441 when Wubri, a Yonyonse hero and an important figure in [[Burkina Faso]]'s history, led his tribe to victory. He then renamed the area from \"Kumbee-Tenga\", as the Ninsi had called it, to \"Wage sabre soba koumbem tenga\", meaning \"head war chief's village\". ''Ouagadougou'' is a [[Francophone]] spelling of the name.\n[[File:Memorial ouaga2000 crop.jpg|thumb| Monument des H\u00e9ros Nationaux]]\nThe city became the [[Capital city|capital]] of the [[Mossi Empire]] in 1441 and became the permanent residence of the Mossi emperors (Moro-Naba) in 1681.<ref name=\"wikifr\">[[:fr:Ouagadougou]]</ref> The [[Moro-Naba Ceremony]] is still performed every Friday by the Moro-Naba and his court.

An administrative centre of colonial rule, it became an important urban centre in the post-colonial era. First the capital of the [[Mossi Kingdoms]] and later of Upper Volta and Burkina Faso, Ouagadougou became a veritable communal centre in 1995.\n\n==Climate==\n{{see also|Burkina Faso#Geography and climate}}\nOuagadougou's climate is [[hot semi-arid climate|hot semi-arid]] (''BSh'') under [[K\u00f6ppen-Geiger climate classification system|K\u00f6ppen-Geiger classification]], and closely borders with [[tropical wet and dry climate|tropical wet and dry]] (''Aw'').

Districts of Ouagadougou include Gounghin, Kamsaoghin, Koulouba, Moemmin, Niogsin, Paspanga, Peuloghin, Bilbalogho, and Tiendpalogo. Seventeen villages comprise the Ouagadougou metropolitan area, which is about {{convert|219.3|km\u00b2|1|abbr=on}}.\n\nThe population of this area is estimated at 1,475,000, 48% of whom are men and 52% women. The rural population is about 5% and the urban population about 95% of the total, and the density is 6,727 inhabitants per square kilometre, according to the 2006 census.\n\nOuagadougou's communes have invested in huge city-management projects. This is largely because Ouagadougou constitutes a 'cultural centre' by merit of holding the [[SIAO]] (International Arts and Crafts fair) and the [[FESPACO]] (Panafrican Film and Television Festival of Ouagadougou). Moreover, the villages' growing affluence allows for such investment, and the population's rapid growth necessitates it.<ref name=\"Com\"/>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n|+ The Arrondissements of Ouagadougou\n|-\n!

Considering it a sacred forest, many went there for traditional initiations or for refuge. The French colonists, disregarding its local significance and history, established it as a park in the 1930s. In 1985, renovations were done in the park. In January 2001, the park was renamed \"Parc Urbain Bangr-Weoogo\", meaning \"the urban park of the forest of knowledge\".\n\nAnother notable park in Ouagadougou is the \"L'Unit\u00e9 P\u00e9dagogique\", which shelters animals in a semi-free state. This botanic garden/biosphere system stretches over {{convert|8|ha|acre}} and also serves as a museum for the country's history.\n\n\"Jardin de l'amiti\u00e9 Ouaga-Loudun\" (Garden of Ouaga-Loudun Friendship), with a green space that was renovated in 1996, is a symbol of the twin-city relationship between Ouagadougou and Loudun in France.

It is also the [[List of cities in Burkina Faso#10 largest cities|country's largest city]], with a population of 2,200,000 in 2015. The city's name is often shortened to ''Ouaga''. The inhabitants are called ''ouagalais''. The spelling of the name ''Ouagadougou'' is derived from the [[French orthography]] common in former [[French African colonies]].\n\nOuagadougou's primary industries are food processing and textiles. It is served by an [[Ouagadougou Airport|international airport]] and is linked by rail to [[Abidjan]] in the [[Ivory Coast]] and, for freight only, to [[Kaya, Burkina Faso|Kaya]]. There are several highways linking the city to [[Niamey]], [[Niger]], south to Ghana, and southwest to [[Ivory Coast]]. Ouagadougou has one of West Africa's largest markets, which burned down in 2003 and has since reopened with better facilities and improved fire-prevention measures. Other attractions include the National Museum of Burkina Faso, the Moro-Naba Palace (site of the [[Moro-Naba Ceremony]]), the [[National Museum of Music (Burkina Faso)|National Museum of Music]], and several craft markets.\n\n==History==\n{{see also|Timeline of Ouagadougou}}\n[[File:NE 1200ad.jpg|right|thumb|upright=1.4|Europe, Africa and the Near East in 1200, showing the [[Mossi Kingdoms|Kingdom of Wagadugu]] (in West Africa, just to the right of the area labeled '25') and its neighbors.]]\nThe name ''Ouagadougou'' dates back to the 15th century when the Ninsi tribes inhabited the area.<ref> Britannica, [https://www.britannica.com/place/Ouagadougou Ouagadougou], britannica.com, USA, accessed on July 7, 2019</ref> They were in constant conflict until 1441 when Wubri, a Yonyonse hero and an important figure in [[Burkina Faso]]'s history, led his tribe to victory. He then renamed the area from \"Kumbee-Tenga\", as the Ninsi had called it, to \"Wage sabre soba koumbem tenga\", meaning \"head war chief's village\". ''Ouagadougou'' is a [[Francophone]] spelling of the name.\n[[File:Memorial ouaga2000 crop.jpg|thumb| Monument des H\u00e9ros Nationaux]]\nThe city became the [[Capital city|capital]] of the [[Mossi Empire]] in 1441 and became the permanent residence of the Mossi emperors (Moro-Naba) in 1681.<ref name=\"wikifr\">[[:fr:Ouagadougou]]</ref> The [[Moro-Naba Ceremony]] is still performed every Friday by the Moro-Naba and his court.

Three of the perpetrators were also killed.\n\n==Geography==\nOuagadougou, situated on the central plateau ({{coord|12.4|N|1.5|W}}), grew around the imperial palace of the [[Mogho Naaba]]. An administrative centre of colonial rule, it became an important urban centre in the post-colonial era. First the capital of the [[Mossi Kingdoms]] and later of Upper Volta and Burkina Faso, Ouagadougou became a veritable communal centre in 1995.\n\n==Climate==\n{{see also|Burkina Faso#Geography and climate}}\nOuagadougou's climate is [[hot semi-arid climate|hot semi-arid]] (''BSh'') under [[K\u00f6ppen-Geiger climate classification system|K\u00f6ppen-Geiger classification]], and closely borders with [[tropical wet and dry climate|tropical wet and dry]] (''Aw'').

Districts of Ouagadougou include Gounghin, Kamsaoghin, Koulouba, Moemmin, Niogsin, Paspanga, Peuloghin, Bilbalogho, and Tiendpalogo. Seventeen villages comprise the Ouagadougou metropolitan area, which is about {{convert|219.3|km\u00b2|1|abbr=on}}.\n\nThe population of this area is estimated at 1,475,000, 48% of whom are men and 52% women. The rural population is about 5% and the urban population about 95% of the total, and the density is 6,727 inhabitants per square kilometre, according to the 2006 census.\n\nOuagadougou's communes have invested in huge city-management projects. This is largely because Ouagadougou constitutes a 'cultural centre' by merit of holding the [[SIAO]] (International Arts and Crafts fair) and the [[FESPACO]] (Panafrican Film and Television Festival of Ouagadougou). Moreover, the villages' growing affluence allows for such investment, and the population's rapid growth necessitates it.<ref name=\"Com\"/>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n|+ The Arrondissements of Ouagadougou\n|-\n!
