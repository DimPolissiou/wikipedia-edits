Historians often study the [[historical reliability of the Acts of the Apostles]] when studying the reliability of the gospels, as Acts was seemingly written by the same author as the ''Gospel of Luke''. \n\nAmong scholars, a growing majority considers the Gospels to be in the genre of Ancient Greco-Roman biographies,<ref name=\":0\">Keener, Craig S. \"Otho: A Targeted Comparison of Suetonius's Biography and Tacitus's History, with Implications for the Gospels' Historical Reliability.\" Bulletin for Biblical Research (2011): 331-355.

''Misquoting Jesus: The Story Behind Who Changed the Bible and Why''. HarperSanFrancisco, 2005, pp. 88\u201389.</ref> scholars use [[textual criticism]] to determine which gospel variants could theoretically be taken as 'original'. To answer this question, scholars have to ask [[Historicity of the canonical Gospels#Authorship and date|who wrote the gospels]], when they wrote them, what was their objective in writing them,<ref name=\"Rhodes-Eddy08\"/> what sources the authors used, how reliable these sources were, and how far removed in time the sources were from the stories they narrate, or if they were altered later. Scholars can also look into the [[Historicity of the canonical Gospels#Historical reliability of the Gospels|internal evidence]] of the documents, to see if, for example, the document is misquoting texts from the Hebrew [[Tanakh]], is making claims about geography that were incorrect or if the author appears to be hiding information. Finally, scholars turn to external sources, including the [[Historicity of the canonical Gospels#Preserved by the church|testimony of early church leaders]], writers [[Historicity of the canonical Gospels#Outside of the church|outside the church]] (mainly Jewish and Greco-Roman historians) who would have been more likely to have criticized the early churches, and to archaeological evidence.\n\nMatthew and Luke depend on three shared written Greek sources: the gospel of Mark; a \"sayings of Jesus\" collection called [[Q document|Q]]; and the Jewish scriptures in a Greek translation called the [[Septuagint]].{{sfn|Fredriksen|2000|p=unpaginated}} They also contain some material unique to each: this is called the \"M\" material for Matthew and \"L\" for Luke.{{sfn|Reid|1996|p=18}}\n\n==Methodology==\nIn evaluating the historical reliability of the Gospels, scholars consider authorship and date of composition,<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">Craig L.

New Testament scholar [[Graham Stanton]] states that \"the gospels are now widely considered to be a sub-set of the broad ancient literary genre of biographies.\"<ref>Graham Stanton, ''Jesus and Gospel.'' p.192.</ref> Charles H. Talbert agrees that the gospels should be grouped with the Graeco-Roman biographies, but adds that such biographies included an element of mythology, and that the synoptic gospels also included elements of mythology.<ref name=\"Charles H. Talbert pg 42\"/> E.P. Sanders states that \"these Gospels were written with the intention of glorifying Jesus and are not strictly biographical in nature.\"<ref name=\"Sanders\"/> Ingrid Maisch and Anton V\u00f6gtle writing for Karl Rahner in his encyclopedia of theological terms indicate that the gospels were written primarily as theological, not historical items.<ref>Encyclopedia of theology: a concise Sacramentum mundi by Karl Rahner 2004 {{ISBN|0-86012-006-6}} pages 730\u2013741</ref> Erasmo Leiva-Merikakis notes that \"we must conclude, then, that the genre of the Gospel is not that of pure 'history'; but neither is it that of myth, fairy tale, or legend. In fact, 'gospel' constitutes a genre all its own, a surprising novelty in the literature of the ancient world.\"<ref name=\"ReferenceC\"/> \n\nScholars tend to consider Luke's works ([[Luke-Acts]]) to be closer in genre to \"pure\" history,<ref name=\"religion-online.org\"/><ref name=\"religion-online.org\"/><ref>Richard Bauckham, ''Jesus and the Eyewitnesses''. 117.</ref> although they also note that \"This is not to say that he [Luke] was always reliably informed, or that \u2013 any more than modern historians \u2013 he always presented a severely factual account of events.\"<ref name=\"religion-online.org\"/>\nNew Testament scholar, [[James D.G. Dunn]] believes that \"the earliest tradents within the Christian churches [were] preservers more than innovators...seeking to transmit, retell, explain, interpret, elaborate, but not create ''de novo''...Through the main body of the Synoptic tradition, I believe, we have in most cases direct access to the teaching and ministry of Jesus as it was remembered from the beginning of the transmission process (which often predates Easter) and so fairly direct access to the ministry and teaching of Jesus through the eyes and ears of those who went about with him.\"<ref>James D.G. Dunn, \"Messianic Ideas and Their Influence on the Jesus of History,\" in ''The Messiah'', ed. James H. Charlesworth. pp. 371\u2013372. Cf. James D.G. Dunn, ''Jesus Remembered''.</ref> Nevertheless, [[David Jenkins (bishop)|David Jenkins]], a former Anglican Bishop of Durham and university professor, has stated that \"Certainly not!

These criteria are the [[criterion of dissimilarity]]; the [[criterion of embarrassment]]; the [[criterion of multiple attestation]]; the criterion of cultural and historical congruency; the criterion of \"Aramaisms\". They are applied to the sayings and events as described in the Gospels, in order to evaluate their historical reliability. \n\nThe [[criterion of dissimilarity]] argues that if a saying or action is dissimilar to, or contrary to, the views of Judaism in the context of Jesus or the views of the early church, then it can more confidently be regarded as an authentic saying or action of Jesus.<ref>Norman Perrin, ''Rediscovering the Teaching of Jesus'' 43.</ref><ref>[[Christopher Tuckett]], \"Sources and Method\" in ''The Cambridge Companion to Jesus.'' ed. Markus Bockmuehl. 132.</ref> One commonly cited example of this is Jesus' controversial reinterpretation of the [[Mosaic law]] in his Sermon on the Mount, or Peter's decision to allow [[Circumcision controversy in early Christianity|uncircumcised gentiles]] into what was, at the time, a [[Jewish Christianity|sect of Judaism]]. \n\nThe [[criterion of embarrassment]] holds that the authors of the gospels had no reason to invent embarrassing incidents such as the denial of Jesus by [[Saint Peter|Peter]], or the fleeing of Jesus' followers after his arrest, and therefore such details would likely not have been included unless they were true.<ref name=\"A Marginal Jew\">Meier, John P., ''[[John P. Meier#A Marginal Jew: Rethinking the Historical Jesus|A Marginal Jew: Rethinking the Historical Jesus]]'', Doubleday: 1991. vol 1: pp. 168\u2013171.</ref> Bart Ehrman, using the criterion of dissimilarity to judge the historical reliability of the claim Jesus was baptized by [[John the Baptist]], notes that \"it is hard to imagine a Christian inventing the story of Jesus' baptism since this could be taken to mean that he was John's subordinate.\"<ref>Bart D. Ehrman, ''The New Testament:A Historical Introduction to the Early Christian Writings.''194-5.</ref>\n\nThe [[criterion of multiple attestation]] says that when two or more independent sources present similar or consistent accounts, it is more likely that the accounts are accurate reports of events or that they are reporting a tradition which pre-dates the sources themselves.<ref>The criteria for authenticity in historical-Jesus research: previous discussion and new proposals, by Stanley E. Porter, pg. 118</ref> This is often used to note that the four gospels attest to most of the same events, but that Paul's epistles often attest to these events as well, as do the writings of the early church, and to a limited degree non-Christian ancient writings. \n\nThe criterion of cultural and historical congruency says that a source is less credible if the account contradicts known historical facts, or if it conflicts with cultural practices common in the period in question.<ref>The criteria for authenticity in historical-Jesus research: previous discussion and new proposals, by Stanley E. Porter, pg. 119</ref> It is, therefore, more credible if it agrees with those known facts. For example, this is often used when assessing the reliability of claims in Luke-Acts, such as the official title of [[Pontius Pilate]]. Through linguistic criteria a number of conclusions can be drawn. \n\nThe criterion of \"Aramaisms\" as it is often referred<ref>Bart D. Ehrman, ''The New Testament:A Historical Introduction to the Early Christian Writings.''193.</ref> holds that if a [[Aramaic of Jesus|saying of Jesus has Aramaic roots]], reflecting Jesus' Palestinian context, the saying is more likely to be authentic.<ref>Stanley E. Porter, ''The Criteria for Authenticity in Historical-Jesus Research: previous discussion and new proposals.''127.</ref>\n==Social and political context==\nRoman imperial ideology placed a strong emphasis on the deification of emperors.{{sfn|Yamazaki-Ransom|2010|p=79}}\n\n==Formation==\n{{Main|Authorship of the Bible|Dating the Bible}}\n[[File:The Evangelist Matthew Inspired by an Angel.jpg|right|thumb|''Evangelist Matthe\u00fcs en de engel'' by [[Rembrandt]]]]\n===From oral traditions to written gospels===\nIn the immediate aftermath of Jesus' death his followers expected him to return at any moment, certainly within their own lifetimes, and in consequence there was little motivation to write anything down for future generations; but as eyewitnesses began to die, and as the missionary needs of the church grew, there was an increasing demand and need for written versions of the founder's life and teachings.{{sfn|Reddish|2011|p=17}} The stages of this process can be summarised as follows:{{sfn|Burkett|2002|pp=124\u201325}}\n# Oral traditions \u2013 stories and sayings passed on largely as separate self-contained units, not in any order;\n# Written collections of miracle stories, parables, sayings, etc., with oral tradition continuing alongside these;\n# Written proto-gospels preceding and serving as sources for the gospels;\n# Canonical gospels of [[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]], [[Gospel of Mark|Mark]], [[Gospel of Luke|Luke]] and [[Gospel of John|John]] composed from these sources.\n\nThe New Testament preserves signs of these oral traditions and early documents:{{sfn|Valantasis|Bleyle|Haugh|2009|p=7}} for example, parallel passages between Matthew, Mark and Luke on one hand and the [[Pauline epistles]] and the [[Epistle to the Hebrews]] on the other are typically explained by assuming that all were relying on a shared oral tradition,{{sfn|Smith|2011|p=2}} and the dedicatory preface of Luke refers to previous written accounts of the life of Jesus.{{sfn|Martens|2004|p=100}} The early traditions were fluid and subject to alteration, sometimes transmitted by those who had known Jesus personally, but more often by wandering prophets and teachers like the [[Apostle Paul]], who knew him through visionary experiences.{{sfn|Valantasis|Bleyle|Haugh|2009|p=7,10,14}} The early prophets and leaders of local Christian communities and their followers were more focused on the [[Kingdom of God]] than on the life of Jesus: Paul for example, says very little about him beyond that he was \"born of a woman\" (meaning that he was a man and not a phantom), that he was a Jew, and that he suffered, died, and was resurrected: what mattered for Paul was not Jesus's teachings or the details of his death and resurrection, but the kingdom.{{sfn|Valantasis|Bleyle|Haugh|2009|p=11}}\n\nThe four canonical gospels were first mentioned between 120 and 150 by [[Justin Martyr]], who lived c.100-185.{{sfn|Smith|2011|p=7}} Justin had no titles for them and simply called them the \"memoirs of the Apostles\", but around 185 [[Iraneus]], a bishop of Lyon who lived c.130\u2013c.202, attributed them to: 1) Matthew, an apostle who followed Jesus in his earthly career; 2) Mark, who while himself not a disciple was the companion of Peter, who was; 3) Luke, the companion of Paul, the author of the [[Pauline epistles]]; and 4) John, who like Matthew was an apostle who had known Jesus.{{sfn|Smith|2011|p=7}} \nChristian apologists and most lay Christians assume on the basis of 4th century Church teaching that the gospels were written by the Evangelists c.50-65 AD, but the scholarly consensus is that they are the work of unknown Christians and were composed c.68-110 AD.{{sfn|Valantasis|Bleyle|Haugh|2009|p=19}}{{sfn|Smith|2011|p=7}}\n\n===Role of eyewitnesses===\nThe majority of New Testament scholars agree that the Gospels do not contain eyewitness accounts;{{sfn|Eve|2014|p=135}} instead, the four were written in and for various Christian communities for the purpose of proclamation, and as a result they present the theologies of their communities rather than the testimony of eyewitnesses.{{sfn|Bellinzoni|2016|p=336}} This view has been challenged in recent years, [[Richard Bauckham]], for example, arguing that each gospel is the work of a single author writing from personal knowledge of the career of Jesus, with the differences between them arising from the gospel-writers' attempts to interpret Jesus and his mission.{{sfn|Wilson|2014|p=135}} This differs markedly from the majority view, in which the traditions behind each gospel were formed by communities (and therefore fluid), and also from that of another scholar, [[James Dunn (theologian)|James Dunn]], who allowed eyewitnesses an important role in formulating the traditions while still keeping the various Christian communities.{{sfn|Bauckham|2008|p=290}} At stake was (or is) the scholarly process called [[form criticism]], which looks at the social situation (the [[sitz im leben]], place in life) in which texts and traditions arise and are formed: for Bauckham and others, community is irrelevant, because the tradition is derived from the eyewitnesses and carefully guarded.{{sfn|Bauckham|2008|p=290}}\n\nBauckham's thesis has clear implications for the reliability of the gospels: they can be trusted because they are based on eyewitness testimony.{{sfn|K\u00f6stenberger|Bock|Chatraw|2014|p=137}} Nevertheless, [[evangelical]] scholar [[Craig Blomberg]] says that the main finding of source criticism, namely an initial period of oral tradition, is well founded.{{sfn|Blomberg|2009|p=97}} Luke in the prologue to his gospel ([[Luke 1#Verses 1\u20134|Luke 1:1\u20134]]) seems to bear out the findings of critical scholarship regarding the formation of the gospels: sources consisting of \"things...handed down to us by those who from the first were eyewitnesses\" (oral tradition), written sources by the \"many [who] have undertaken to draw up an account\" (for Luke, including at least Mark and possibly Matthew), and those like Luke himself who wished to write his own account, corresponding to the redaction of theologically-motivated gospels.{{sfn|Blomberg|2009|p=97}}\n\n==Writing the gospels==\n{{Main|Synoptic Gospels|Source criticism (biblical studies)}}\n\n===The synoptics: Matthew, Mark and Luke===\n[[File:Relationship between synoptic gospels-en.svg|thumb|right|350px|The \"triple tradition\" is material shared by the three gospels, and the \"double tradition\" is shared by Matthew and Luke but not by Mark - this is the Q source. The unique material in Matthew and Luke is Special M and Special L. The chart is based on A.K. Honor\u00e9, \"A statistical study of the synoptic problem\", Novum Testamentum, Vol. 10, Fasc. 2/3 (Apr.-Jul., 1968),pp.95-147.]]\n\nMatthew, Mark and Luke are called the [[synoptic gospels]] because they share many stories (the technical term is [[pericopes]]), sometimes even identical wording; finding an explanation for their similarities, and also their differences, is known as the [[synoptic problem]],{{sfn|Puskas|Robbins|2011|p=86,89}} and most scholars believe that the best solution to the problem is that Mark was the first gospel to be written and served as the source for the other two{{sfn|Reddish|2011|p=27,29}} - alternative theories exist, but create more problems than they solve.{{sfn|Reid|1996|p=18}}\n\nMatthew and Luke also share a large amount of material which is not found in Mark; this appears in the same order in each, although not always in the same contexts, leading scholars to the conclusion that in addition to Mark they also shared a lost source called the [[Q document]] (from \"Quelle\", the German word for \"source);{{sfn|Reid|1996|p=18}} its existence and use alongside Mark by the authors of Matthew and Luke seems the most convincing solution to the synoptic problem.{{sfn|Tiwald|2020|p=13-14}} \n\nMatthew and Luke contain some material unique to each, called the [[M source]] (or Special Matthew) for Matthew and the [[L source]] (Special Luke) for Luke.{{sfn|Reid|1996|p=18}} The pericopes from M and L include some of the best-known stories in the gospels, such as the stories of the birth of Christ and the parables of the good Samaritan and the \"pearl of great price\".{{sfn|Isaak|2011|p=108}} \n\nThe Hebrew scriptures were also an important source for all three, and for John.{{sfn|Valantasis|Bleyle|Haugh|2009|p=14}} Direct quotations number 27 in Mark, 54 in Matthew, 24 in Luke, and 14 in John, and the influence of the scriptures is vastly increased when allusions and echoes are included.{{sfn|Yu Chui Siang Lau|2010|p=159}} Half of Mark's gospel, for example, is made up of allusions to and citations of the scriptures, which he uses to structure his narrative and to present his understanding of the ministry, passion, death and resurrection of Jesus (for example, the final cry from the cross, \"My Lord, my Lord, why have you you forsaken me?\" is a quotation from psalm 22:2: \"My God, my God, why have you abandoned me?\"{{sfn|Valantasis|Bleyle|Haugh|2009|p=82-83}} Matthew contains all Mark's quotations and introduces around 30 more, sometimes in the mouth of Jesus, sometimes as his own commentary on the narrative,{{sfn|Moyise|2011|p=33}} and Luke makes allusions to all but three of the Old Testament books.{{sfn|Kimball|1994|p=48}}\n\n\n\n===Mark===\nTradition holds that the gospel was written by [[Mark the Evangelist]], [[St. Peter]]'s interpreter, but its reliance on several underlying sources, varying in form and in theology, makes this unlikely.{{sfn|Theissen|Merz|1998|p=24-27}} Most scholars believe it was written shortly before or after the [[Siege of Jerusalem (70)|fall of Jerusalem]] and the destruction of the [[Herod's Temple|Second Temple]] in the year 70,{{sfn|Reddish|2011|p=74}} and internal evidence suggests that it probably originated in Syria or Palestine among a Christian community consisting at least partly of non-Jews who spoke Greek rather than Aramaic and did not understand Jewish culture.{{sfn|Schroter|2010|p=273-274}} \n\nScholars since the 19th century have regarded Mark as the first of the gospels (called the theory of [[Markan priority]]).<ref group=\"Notes\" name=\"Priority\">\"Markan priority\" is based on several lines of reasoning:\n* ''Content'': Mark is simpler than Matthew and Luke; it is seen as unlikely that Mark would eliminate the missing stories;\n* ''Mistakes'': Mark makes mistakes with history, the Hebrew scriptures and with Jewish law, which Matthew and Luke appear to have corrected; it is seen as unlikely that Mark would have deliberately changed correct information to incorrect;\n* ''Wording'': Mark's language is less literary than that of Matthew and Luke; it seems unlikely that Mark would have downgraded this language;\n* ''Length'': Mark is shorter than Matthew or Luke, yet his individual stories are longer; it is considered unlikely that he would have shortened one of the others overall, while lengthening the pericopes;\n* ''\"Editorial fatigue\"'': Editorial fatigue is the phenomenon whereby an editor introduces inconsistencies while adapting a source, resulting in errors; Matthew and Luke make such errors, but Mark does not.<br> See Smith (2011), pages 12-16.</ref> Markan priority led to the belief that Mark must be the most reliable of the gospels, but today there is a large consensus that the author of Mark was not intending to write history.{{sfn|Williamson|1983|p=17-18}} Mark preserves memories of real people (including the disciples), places and circumstances, but it is based on previously existing traditions which have been selected and arranged by the author to express his understanding of the significance of Jesus.{{sfn|Schroter|2010|p=273-274}}\n\nMark is a counter-narrative to the myth of Imperial rule crafted by Vespasian.{{sfn|Winn|2018|p=45}}\nIn 1901 [[William Wrede]] demonstrated that Mark was not a simple historical account of the life of Jesus but a work of theology compiled by an author who was a creative artist.{{sfn|Strickland|Young|2017|p=3}} There has been little interest in his sources until recently, but candidates include the Elijah-Elisha narrative in the [[Books of Kings|Book of Kings]] and the Pauline letters, notably [[1 Corinthians]], and even [[Homer]].{{sfn|Nelligan|2015|p=xivxv}}\n\n[[Maurice Casey]] believes that Mark's gospel contains traces of literal translations of Aramaic sources, and that this implies, in some cases, a ''sitz im leben'' in the lifetime of Jesus and a very early date for the gospel.{{sfn|Casey|1999|p=86,136}}\n\n===Matthew and Luke===\nThe consensus of scholars dates Matthew and Luke to 80-90 AD.{{sfn|Reddish|2011|p=144}}<ref group=\"Notes\" name=\"DatingMatthewLuke\">Matthew and Luke both use Mark, composed around 70, as a source, and both show a knowledge of the destruction of Jerusalem in 70 (Matthew 22:1-10 and Luke 19:43 and 21:20). These provide an earliest possible date for both gospels; for end-dates, the epistles of [[Ignatius of Antioch]] show a familiarity with the gospel of Matthew, and as Ignatius died during the reign of the Emperor [[Trajan]] (r.98-117), Matthew cannot have been written later than this; and Acts, which scholars agree was written by the author of Luke, shows no awareness of the letters of Paul, which were circulating widely by the end of the 1st century. See Sim (2008), pages 15-16, and Reddish (2011), pages 144-145.</ref> The scholarly consensus is that Matthew originated in a \"Matthean community\" in Antioch (a city in Syria);{{sfn|Sim|2008|p=15-16}} Luke was written in a large city west of Palestine,{{sfn|Theissen|Merz|1998|p=32}} for an educated Greek-speaking audience.{{sfn|Green|1995|pp=16\u201317}}\nScholars doubt that the authors were the evangelists Matthew and Luke: it seems unlikely, for example, that Matthew would rely so heavily on Mark if its author had been an eyewitness to Jesus's ministry,{{sfn|Burkett|2002|p=174}} or that the [[Acts of Apostles]] (by the same author as the gospel of Luke) would so frequently contradict the Pauline letters if its author had been Paul's companion.{{sfn|Theissen|Merz|1998|p=32}}{{sfn|Ehrman|2005|pp=172,235}} Instead, the two took for their sources the gospel of Mark (606 of Matthew's verses are taken from Mark, 320 of Luke's),{{sfn|Augsburger|2004|p=unpaginated}} the Q source, and the \"special\" material of M and L.\n\n===Q (Quelle)===\nMark has 661 verses, 637 of which are reproduced in Matthew and/or Luke.{{sfn|Augsburger|2004|p=unpaginated}} Matthew and Luke share a further 200 verses (roughly) which are not taken from Mark: this is called the Q source.{{sfn|Augsburger|2004|p=unpaginated}}<ref group=\"Notes\" name=\"QHypothesis\">The existence of the Q source is a hypothesis linked to the most popular explanation of the synoptic problem; other explanations of that problem do away with the need for Q, but are less widely accepted.

These are called [[Interpolation (manuscripts)|interpolations]]. In modern translations of the Bible, the results of textual criticism have led to certain verses, words and phrases being left out or marked as not original.\n\nFor example, there are a number of [[Chapters and verses of the Bible|Bible verses]] in the New Testament that are present in the [[King James Version]] (KJV) but are absent from most modern Bible translations. Most modern textual scholars consider these verses [[Interpolation (manuscripts)|interpolations]] (exceptions include advocates of the [[Byzantine text-type|Byzantine or Majority text]]). The verse numbers have been reserved, but without any text, so as to preserve the traditional numbering of the remaining verses. The [[Biblical studies|Biblical scholar]] [[Bart D.

Historians often study the [[historical reliability of the Acts of the Apostles]] when studying the reliability of the gospels, as Acts was seemingly written by the same author as the ''Gospel of Luke''. \n\nAmong scholars, a growing majority considers the Gospels to be in the genre of Ancient Greco-Roman biographies,<ref name=\":0\">Keener, Craig S. \"Otho: A Targeted Comparison of Suetonius's Biography and Tacitus's History, with Implications for the Gospels' Historical Reliability.\" Bulletin for Biblical Research (2011): 331-355.

''Misquoting Jesus: The Story Behind Who Changed the Bible and Why''. HarperSanFrancisco, 2005, pp. 88\u201389.</ref> scholars use [[textual criticism]] to determine which gospel variants could theoretically be taken as 'original'. To answer this question, scholars have to ask [[Historicity of the canonical Gospels#Authorship and date|who wrote the gospels]], when they wrote them, what was their objective in writing them,<ref name=\"Rhodes-Eddy08\"/> what sources the authors used, how reliable these sources were, and how far removed in time the sources were from the stories they narrate, or if they were altered later. Scholars can also look into the [[Historicity of the canonical Gospels#Historical reliability of the Gospels|internal evidence]] of the documents, to see if, for example, the document is misquoting texts from the Hebrew [[Tanakh]], is making claims about geography that were incorrect or if the author appears to be hiding information. Finally, scholars turn to external sources, including the [[Historicity of the canonical Gospels#Preserved by the church|testimony of early church leaders]], writers [[Historicity of the canonical Gospels#Outside of the church|outside the church]] (mainly Jewish and Greco-Roman historians) who would have been more likely to have criticized the early churches, and to archaeological evidence.\n\nMatthew and Luke depend on three shared written Greek sources: the gospel of Mark; a \"sayings of Jesus\" collection called [[Q document|Q]]; and the Jewish scriptures in a Greek translation called the [[Septuagint]].{{sfn|Fredriksen|2000|p=unpaginated}} They also contain some material unique to each: this is called the \"M\" material for Matthew and \"L\" for Luke.{{sfn|Reid|1996|p=18}}\n\n==Methodology==\nIn evaluating the historical reliability of the Gospels, scholars consider authorship and date of composition,<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">Craig L.

New Testament scholar [[Graham Stanton]] states that \"the gospels are now widely considered to be a sub-set of the broad ancient literary genre of biographies.\"<ref>Graham Stanton, ''Jesus and Gospel.'' p.192.</ref> Charles H. Talbert agrees that the gospels should be grouped with the Graeco-Roman biographies, but adds that such biographies included an element of mythology, and that the synoptic gospels also included elements of mythology.<ref name=\"Charles H. Talbert pg 42\"/> E.P. Sanders states that \"these Gospels were written with the intention of glorifying Jesus and are not strictly biographical in nature.\"<ref name=\"Sanders\"/> Ingrid Maisch and Anton V\u00f6gtle writing for Karl Rahner in his encyclopedia of theological terms indicate that the gospels were written primarily as theological, not historical items.<ref>Encyclopedia of theology: a concise Sacramentum mundi by Karl Rahner 2004 {{ISBN|0-86012-006-6}} pages 730\u2013741</ref> Erasmo Leiva-Merikakis notes that \"we must conclude, then, that the genre of the Gospel is not that of pure 'history'; but neither is it that of myth, fairy tale, or legend. In fact, 'gospel' constitutes a genre all its own, a surprising novelty in the literature of the ancient world.\"<ref name=\"ReferenceC\"/> \n\nScholars tend to consider Luke's works ([[Luke-Acts]]) to be closer in genre to \"pure\" history,<ref name=\"religion-online.org\"/><ref name=\"religion-online.org\"/><ref>Richard Bauckham, ''Jesus and the Eyewitnesses''. 117.</ref> although they also note that \"This is not to say that he [Luke] was always reliably informed, or that \u2013 any more than modern historians \u2013 he always presented a severely factual account of events.\"<ref name=\"religion-online.org\"/>\nNew Testament scholar, [[James D.G. Dunn]] believes that \"the earliest tradents within the Christian churches [were] preservers more than innovators...seeking to transmit, retell, explain, interpret, elaborate, but not create ''de novo''...Through the main body of the Synoptic tradition, I believe, we have in most cases direct access to the teaching and ministry of Jesus as it was remembered from the beginning of the transmission process (which often predates Easter) and so fairly direct access to the ministry and teaching of Jesus through the eyes and ears of those who went about with him.\"<ref>James D.G. Dunn, \"Messianic Ideas and Their Influence on the Jesus of History,\" in ''The Messiah'', ed. James H. Charlesworth. pp. 371\u2013372. Cf. James D.G. Dunn, ''Jesus Remembered''.</ref> Nevertheless, [[David Jenkins (bishop)|David Jenkins]], a former Anglican Bishop of Durham and university professor, has stated that \"Certainly not!

These criteria are the [[criterion of dissimilarity]]; the [[criterion of embarrassment]]; the [[criterion of multiple attestation]]; the criterion of cultural and historical congruency; the criterion of \"Aramaisms\". They are applied to the sayings and events as described in the Gospels, in order to evaluate their historical reliability. \n\nThe [[criterion of dissimilarity]] argues that if a saying or action is dissimilar to, or contrary to, the views of Judaism in the context of Jesus or the views of the early church, then it can more confidently be regarded as an authentic saying or action of Jesus.<ref>Norman Perrin, ''Rediscovering the Teaching of Jesus'' 43.</ref><ref>[[Christopher Tuckett]], \"Sources and Method\" in ''The Cambridge Companion to Jesus.'' ed. Markus Bockmuehl. 132.</ref> One commonly cited example of this is Jesus' controversial reinterpretation of the [[Mosaic law]] in his Sermon on the Mount, or Peter's decision to allow [[Circumcision controversy in early Christianity|uncircumcised gentiles]] into what was, at the time, a [[Jewish Christianity|sect of Judaism]]. \n\nThe [[criterion of embarrassment]] holds that the authors of the gospels had no reason to invent embarrassing incidents such as the denial of Jesus by [[Saint Peter|Peter]], or the fleeing of Jesus' followers after his arrest, and therefore such details would likely not have been included unless they were true.<ref name=\"A Marginal Jew\">Meier, John P., ''[[John P. Meier#A Marginal Jew: Rethinking the Historical Jesus|A Marginal Jew: Rethinking the Historical Jesus]]'', Doubleday: 1991. vol 1: pp. 168\u2013171.</ref> Bart Ehrman, using the criterion of dissimilarity to judge the historical reliability of the claim Jesus was baptized by [[John the Baptist]], notes that \"it is hard to imagine a Christian inventing the story of Jesus' baptism since this could be taken to mean that he was John's subordinate.\"<ref>Bart D. Ehrman, ''The New Testament:A Historical Introduction to the Early Christian Writings.''194-5.</ref>\n\nThe [[criterion of multiple attestation]] says that when two or more independent sources present similar or consistent accounts, it is more likely that the accounts are accurate reports of events or that they are reporting a tradition which pre-dates the sources themselves.<ref>The criteria for authenticity in historical-Jesus research: previous discussion and new proposals, by Stanley E. Porter, pg. 118</ref> This is often used to note that the four gospels attest to most of the same events, but that Paul's epistles often attest to these events as well, as do the writings of the early church, and to a limited degree non-Christian ancient writings. \n\nThe criterion of cultural and historical congruency says that a source is less credible if the account contradicts known historical facts, or if it conflicts with cultural practices common in the period in question.<ref>The criteria for authenticity in historical-Jesus research: previous discussion and new proposals, by Stanley E. Porter, pg. 119</ref> It is, therefore, more credible if it agrees with those known facts. For example, this is often used when assessing the reliability of claims in Luke-Acts, such as the official title of [[Pontius Pilate]]. Through linguistic criteria a number of conclusions can be drawn. \n\nThe criterion of \"Aramaisms\" as it is often referred<ref>Bart D. Ehrman, ''The New Testament:A Historical Introduction to the Early Christian Writings.''193.</ref> holds that if a [[Aramaic of Jesus|saying of Jesus has Aramaic roots]], reflecting Jesus' Palestinian context, the saying is more likely to be authentic.<ref>Stanley E. Porter, ''The Criteria for Authenticity in Historical-Jesus Research: previous discussion and new proposals.''127.</ref>\n==Social and political context==\nRoman imperial ideology placed a strong emphasis on the deification of emperors.{{sfn|Yamazaki-Ransom|2010|p=79}}\n\n==Formation==\n{{Main|Authorship of the Bible|Dating the Bible}}\n[[File:The Evangelist Matthew Inspired by an Angel.jpg|right|thumb|''Evangelist Matthe\u00fcs en de engel'' by [[Rembrandt]]]]\n===From oral traditions to written gospels===\nIn the immediate aftermath of Jesus' death his followers expected him to return at any moment, certainly within their own lifetimes, and in consequence there was little motivation to write anything down for future generations; but as eyewitnesses began to die, and as the missionary needs of the church grew, there was an increasing demand and need for written versions of the founder's life and teachings.{{sfn|Reddish|2011|p=17}} The stages of this process can be summarised as follows:{{sfn|Burkett|2002|pp=124\u201325}}\n# Oral traditions \u2013 stories and sayings passed on largely as separate self-contained units, not in any order;\n# Written collections of miracle stories, parables, sayings, etc., with oral tradition continuing alongside these;\n# Written proto-gospels preceding and serving as sources for the gospels;\n# Canonical gospels of [[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]], [[Gospel of Mark|Mark]], [[Gospel of Luke|Luke]] and [[Gospel of John|John]] composed from these sources.\n\nThe New Testament preserves signs of these oral traditions and early documents:{{sfn|Valantasis|Bleyle|Haugh|2009|p=7}} for example, parallel passages between Matthew, Mark and Luke on one hand and the [[Pauline epistles]] and the [[Epistle to the Hebrews]] on the other are typically explained by assuming that all were relying on a shared oral tradition,{{sfn|Smith|2011|p=2}} and the dedicatory preface of Luke refers to previous written accounts of the life of Jesus.{{sfn|Martens|2004|p=100}} The early traditions were fluid and subject to alteration, sometimes transmitted by those who had known Jesus personally, but more often by wandering prophets and teachers like the [[Apostle Paul]], who knew him through visionary experiences.{{sfn|Valantasis|Bleyle|Haugh|2009|p=7,10,14}} The early prophets and leaders of local Christian communities and their followers were more focused on the [[Kingdom of God]] than on the life of Jesus: Paul for example, says very little about him beyond that he was \"born of a woman\" (meaning that he was a man and not a phantom), that he was a Jew, and that he suffered, died, and was resurrected: what mattered for Paul was not Jesus's teachings or the details of his death and resurrection, but the kingdom.{{sfn|Valantasis|Bleyle|Haugh|2009|p=11}}\n\nThe four canonical gospels were first mentioned between 120 and 150 by [[Justin Martyr]], who lived c.100-185.{{sfn|Smith|2011|p=7}} Justin had no titles for them and simply called them the \"memoirs of the Apostles\", but around 185 [[Iraneus]], a bishop of Lyon who lived c.130\u2013c.202, attributed them to: 1) Matthew, an apostle who followed Jesus in his earthly career; 2) Mark, who while himself not a disciple was the companion of Peter, who was; 3) Luke, the companion of Paul, the author of the [[Pauline epistles]]; and 4) John, who like Matthew was an apostle who had known Jesus.{{sfn|Smith|2011|p=7}} \nChristian apologists and most lay Christians assume on the basis of 4th century Church teaching that the gospels were written by the Evangelists c.50-65 AD, but the scholarly consensus is that they are the work of unknown Christians and were composed c.68-110 AD.{{sfn|Valantasis|Bleyle|Haugh|2009|p=19}}{{sfn|Smith|2011|p=7}}\n\n===Role of eyewitnesses===\nThe majority of New Testament scholars agree that the Gospels do not contain eyewitness accounts;{{sfn|Eve|2014|p=135}} instead, the four were written in and for various Christian communities for the purpose of proclamation, and as a result they present the theologies of their communities rather than the testimony of eyewitnesses.{{sfn|Bellinzoni|2016|p=336}} This view has been challenged in recent years, [[Richard Bauckham]], for example, arguing that each gospel is the work of a single author writing from personal knowledge of the career of Jesus, with the differences between them arising from the gospel-writers' attempts to interpret Jesus and his mission.{{sfn|Wilson|2014|p=135}} This differs markedly from the majority view, in which the traditions behind each gospel were formed by communities (and therefore fluid), and also from that of another scholar, [[James Dunn (theologian)|James Dunn]], who allowed eyewitnesses an important role in formulating the traditions while still keeping the various Christian communities.{{sfn|Bauckham|2008|p=290}} At stake was (or is) the scholarly process called [[form criticism]], which looks at the social situation (the [[sitz im leben]], place in life) in which texts and traditions arise and are formed: for Bauckham and others, community is irrelevant, because the tradition is derived from the eyewitnesses and carefully guarded.{{sfn|Bauckham|2008|p=290}}\n\nBauckham's thesis has clear implications for the reliability of the gospels: they can be trusted because they are based on eyewitness testimony.{{sfn|K\u00f6stenberger|Bock|Chatraw|2014|p=137}} Nevertheless, [[evangelical]] scholar [[Craig Blomberg]] says that the main finding of source criticism, namely an initial period of oral tradition, is well founded.{{sfn|Blomberg|2009|p=97}} Luke in the prologue to his gospel ([[Luke 1#Verses 1\u20134|Luke 1:1\u20134]]) seems to bear out the findings of critical scholarship regarding the formation of the gospels: sources consisting of \"things...handed down to us by those who from the first were eyewitnesses\" (oral tradition), written sources by the \"many [who] have undertaken to draw up an account\" (for Luke, including at least Mark and possibly Matthew), and those like Luke himself who wished to write his own account, corresponding to the redaction of theologically-motivated gospels.{{sfn|Blomberg|2009|p=97}}\n\n==Writing the gospels==\n{{Main|Synoptic Gospels|Source criticism (biblical studies)}}\n\n===The synoptics: Matthew, Mark and Luke===\n[[File:Relationship between synoptic gospels-en.svg|thumb|right|350px|The \"triple tradition\" is material shared by the three gospels, and the \"double tradition\" is shared by Matthew and Luke but not by Mark - this is the Q source.

finding an explanation for their similarities, and also their differences, is known as the [[synoptic problem]],{{sfn|Puskas|Robbins|2011|p=86,89}} and most scholars believe that the best solution to the problem is that Mark was the first gospel to be written and served as the source for the other two{{sfn|Reddish|2011|p=27,29}} - alternative theories exist, but create more problems than they solve.{{sfn|Reid|1996|p=18}}\n\nMatthew and Luke also share a large amount of material which is not found in Mark; this appears in the same order in each, although not always in the same contexts, leading scholars to the conclusion that in addition to Mark they also shared a lost source called the [[Q document]] (from \"Quelle\", the German word for \"source);{{sfn|Reid|1996|p=18}} its existence and use alongside Mark by the authors of Matthew and Luke seems the most convincing solution to the synoptic problem.{{sfn|Tiwald|2020|p=13-14}} \n\nMatthew and Luke contain some material unique to each, called the [[M source]] (or Special Matthew) for Matthew and the [[L source]] (Special Luke) for Luke.{{sfn|Reid|1996|p=18}} The pericopes from M and L include some of the best-known stories in the gospels, such as the stories of the birth of Christ and the parables of the good Samaritan and the \"pearl of great price\".{{sfn|Isaak|2011|p=108}} \n\nThe Hebrew scriptures were also an important source for all three, and for John.{{sfn|Valantasis|Bleyle|Haugh|2009|p=14}} Direct quotations number 27 in Mark, 54 in Matthew, 24 in Luke, and 14 in John, and the influence of the scriptures is vastly increased when allusions and echoes are included.{{sfn|Yu Chui Siang Lau|2010|p=159}} Half of Mark's gospel, for example, is made up of allusions to and citations of the scriptures, which he uses to structure his narrative and to present his understanding of the ministry, passion, death and resurrection of Jesus (for example, the final cry from the cross, \"My Lord, my Lord, why have you you forsaken me?\" is a quotation from psalm 22:2: \"My God, my God, why have you abandoned me?\"{{sfn|Valantasis|Bleyle|Haugh|2009|p=82-83}} Matthew contains all Mark's quotations and introduces around 30 more, sometimes in the mouth of Jesus, sometimes as his own commentary on the narrative,{{sfn|Moyise|2011|p=33}} and Luke makes allusions to all but three of the Old Testament books.{{sfn|Kimball|1994|p=48}}\n\n\n\n===Mark===\nTradition holds that the gospel was written by [[Mark the Evangelist]], [[St. Peter]]'s interpreter, but its reliance on several underlying sources, varying in form and in theology, makes this unlikely.{{sfn|Theissen|Merz|1998|p=24-27}} Most scholars believe it was written shortly before or after the [[Siege of Jerusalem (70)|fall of Jerusalem]] and the destruction of the [[Herod's Temple|Second Temple]] in the year 70,{{sfn|Reddish|2011|p=74}} and internal evidence suggests that it probably originated in Syria or Palestine among a Christian community consisting at least partly of non-Jews who spoke Greek rather than Aramaic and did not understand Jewish culture.{{sfn|Schroter|2010|p=273-274}} \n\nScholars since the 19th century have regarded Mark as the first of the gospels (called the theory of [[Markan priority]]).<ref group=\"Notes\" name=\"Priority\">\"Markan priority\" is based on several lines of reasoning:\n* ''Content'': Mark is simpler than Matthew and Luke; it is seen as unlikely that Mark would eliminate the missing stories;\n* ''Mistakes'': Mark makes mistakes with history, the Hebrew scriptures and with Jewish law, which Matthew and Luke appear to have corrected; it is seen as unlikely that Mark would have deliberately changed correct information to incorrect;\n* ''Wording'': Mark's language is less literary than that of Matthew and Luke; it seems unlikely that Mark would have downgraded this language;\n* ''Length'': Mark is shorter than Matthew or Luke, yet his individual stories are longer; it is considered unlikely that he would have shortened one of the others overall, while lengthening the pericopes;\n* ''\"Editorial fatigue\"'': Editorial fatigue is the phenomenon whereby an editor introduces inconsistencies while adapting a source, resulting in errors; Matthew and Luke make such errors, but Mark does not.<br> See Smith (2011), pages 12-16.</ref> Markan priority led to the belief that Mark must be the most reliable of the gospels, but today there is a large consensus that the author of Mark was not intending to write history.{{sfn|Williamson|1983|p=17-18}} Mark preserves memories of real people (including the disciples), places and circumstances, but it is based on previously existing traditions which have been selected and arranged by the author to express his understanding of the significance of Jesus.{{sfn|Schroter|2010|p=273-274}}\n\nMark is a counter-narrative to the myth of Imperial rule crafted by Vespasian.{{sfn|Winn|2018|p=45}}\nIn 1901 [[William Wrede]] demonstrated that Mark was not a simple historical account of the life of Jesus but a work of theology compiled by an author who was a creative artist.{{sfn|Strickland|Young|2017|p=3}} There has been little interest in his sources until recently, but candidates include the Elijah-Elisha narrative in the [[Books of Kings|Book of Kings]] and the Pauline letters, notably [[1 Corinthians]], and even [[Homer]].{{sfn|Nelligan|2015|p=xivxv}}\n\n[[Maurice Casey]] believes that Mark's gospel contains traces of literal translations of Aramaic sources, and that this implies, in some cases, a ''sitz im leben'' in the lifetime of Jesus and a very early date for the gospel.{{sfn|Casey|1999|p=86,136}}\n\n===Matthew and Luke===\nThe consensus of scholars dates Matthew and Luke to 80-90 AD.{{sfn|Reddish|2011|p=144}}<ref group=\"Notes\" name=\"DatingMatthewLuke\">Matthew and Luke both use Mark, composed around 70, as a source, and both show a knowledge of the destruction of Jerusalem in 70 (Matthew 22:1-10 and Luke 19:43 and 21:20). These provide an earliest possible date for both gospels; for end-dates, the epistles of [[Ignatius of Antioch]] show a familiarity with the gospel of Matthew, and as Ignatius died during the reign of the Emperor [[Trajan]] (r.98-117), Matthew cannot have been written later than this; and Acts, which scholars agree was written by the author of Luke, shows no awareness of the letters of Paul, which were circulating widely by the end of the 1st century. See Sim (2008), pages 15-16, and Reddish (2011), pages 144-145.</ref> The scholarly consensus is that Matthew originated in a \"Matthean community\" in Antioch (a city in Syria);{{sfn|Sim|2008|p=15-16}} Luke was written in a large city west of Palestine,{{sfn|Theissen|Merz|1998|p=32}} for an educated Greek-speaking audience.{{sfn|Green|1995|pp=16\u201317}}\nScholars doubt that the authors were the evangelists Matthew and Luke: it seems unlikely, for example, that Matthew would rely so heavily on Mark if its author had been an eyewitness to Jesus's ministry,{{sfn|Burkett|2002|p=174}} or that the [[Acts of Apostles]] (by the same author as the gospel of Luke) would so frequently contradict the Pauline letters if its author had been Paul's companion.{{sfn|Theissen|Merz|1998|p=32}}{{sfn|Ehrman|2005|pp=172,235}} Instead, the two took for their sources the gospel of Mark (606 of Matthew's verses are taken from Mark, 320 of Luke's),{{sfn|Augsburger|2004|p=unpaginated}} the Q source, and the \"special\" material of M and L.\n\n===Q (Quelle)===\nMark has 661 verses, 637 of which are reproduced in Matthew and/or Luke.{{sfn|Augsburger|2004|p=unpaginated}} Matthew and Luke share a further 200 verses (roughly) which are not taken from Mark: this is called the Q source.{{sfn|Augsburger|2004|p=unpaginated}}<ref group=\"Notes\" name=\"QHypothesis\">The existence of the Q source is a hypothesis linked to the most popular explanation of the synoptic problem; other explanations of that problem do away with the need for Q, but are less widely accepted. See Delbert Burkett, \"Rethinking the Gospel Sources: The unity or plurality of Q\" (Volume 2), page 1.</ref> Q is usually dated about a decade earlier than Mark;{{sfn| Moyise2011|2012|p=87}} some scholars argue that it was a single written document, others for multiple documents, and others that there was a core written Q accompanied by an oral tradition.{{sfn|Burkett|2009|p=33ff}} Despite ongoing debate over its exact content - some Q materials in Matthew and Luke are identical word for word, but others are substantially different - there is general consensus about the passages that belong to it.{{sfn|Gillman|2007|p=1112}} It has no passion story and no resurrection, but the Aramaic form of some sayings suggests that its nucleus reaches back to the earliest Palestinian community and even the lifetime of Jesus.{{sfn|Strecker|2012|p=312-313}} \n\nIdentifying the community of Q and the circumstances in which it was created and used  is difficult, but it probably originated in Galilee, in a movement in opposition to the leadership in Jerusalem, as a set of short speeches relating to specific occasions such as covenant-renewal, the commissioning of missionaries, prayers for the Kingdom of God, and calling down divine judgement on their enemies the Pharisees.{{sfn|Burkett|2009|p=46}} A large majority of scholars consider it to be among the oldest and most reliable material in the gospels.{{sfn|Powell|1998|p=38}}\n\n===M and L (Special Matthew and Special Luke)===\nThe premise that Matthew and Luke used sources in addition to Mark and Q is fairly widely accepted, although many details are disputed, including whether they were written or oral, or the invention of the gospel authors, or Q material that happened to be used by only one gospel, or a combination of these.{{sfn|Jones|2011|p=10,17}}\n\n===Sources of John===\nThe Gospel of John speaks of an unnamed \"disciple whom Jesus loved\" as the source of its traditions, but does not say specifically that he is its author;{{sfn|Burkett|2002|p=214}} Christian tradition identifies him as the [[John the Apostle]], but the majority of modern scholars have abandoned this or hold it only tenuously.{{sfn|Lindars|Edwards|Court|2000|p=41}}<ref group=\"Notes\" name=\"Authorship\">For the circumstances which led to the tradition, and the reasons why the majority of modern scholars reject it, see {{harvnb|Lindars|Edwards|Court|2000|pp=41\u201342}}</ref> Most scholars believe it was written ''c''.&nbsp;90\u2013110 AD,{{sfn|Lincoln|2005|p=18}} at [[Early centers of Christianity#Anatolia|Ephesus]] in Anatolia (although other possibilities are Antioch, Northern Syria, Palestine and Alexandria){{sfn|Aune|2003|p=243}}\nand went through two or three \"editions\" before reaching its final form, although a ,minority continue to support unitary composition.{{sfn|Edwards|2015|p=ix}}{{sfn|Lincoln|2005|p=18}} \n\nThe fact that the format of John follows that set by Mark need not imply that the author knew Mark, for there are no identical or almost-identical passages; rather, this was most probably the accepted shape for a gospel by the time John was written.{{sfn|Dunn|2011|p=73}} Nevertheless, John's discourses are full of synoptic-like material: some scholars think this indicates that the author knew the synoptics, although others believe it points instead to a shared base in the oral tradition.{{sfn|Dunn|2011|p=76-77}} John nevertheless differs radically from them:{{sfn|Burkett|2019|p=218}}{{sfn|Dunn|2011|p=72-73}} \n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Ancient [[scribes]] made errors or alterations (such as including non-authentic [[Interpolation (manuscripts)|additions]]).<ref>Ehrman, ''Misquoting Jesus'' (2005), p. 46</ref> In attempting to determine the original text of the New Testament books, some modern textual critics have identified sections as additions of material, centuries after the gospel was written. These are called [[Interpolation (manuscripts)|interpolations]]. In modern translations of the Bible, the results of textual criticism have led to certain verses, words and phrases being left out or marked as not original.\n\nFor example, there are a number of [[Chapters and verses of the Bible|Bible verses]] in the New Testament that are present in the [[King James Version]] (KJV) but are absent from most modern Bible translations. Most modern textual scholars consider these verses [[Interpolation (manuscripts)|interpolations]] (exceptions include advocates of the [[Byzantine text-type|Byzantine or Majority text]]). The verse numbers have been reserved, but without any text, so as to preserve the traditional numbering of the remaining verses. The [[Biblical studies|Biblical scholar]] [[Bart D.
