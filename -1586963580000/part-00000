There are numerous reasons why someone may stand for office as an independent.\n* Independents may support policies which are different from those of the major political parties.\n* Independents may support a party's platform, but choose to stand as an independent because they don't feel the party adequately follows their platform.\n* In some parts of the world, electors may have a tradition of electing independents, so standing for a political party is a disadvantage.\n* In some countries (such as [[Russia]]), a political party can only be registered if it has many members in more than one region, but in certain regions only a minority of electors support the major parties.\n* In some countries (such as [[Kuwait]]), political parties are illegal and all candidates thus stand as independents.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Al-Zumai|first=Fahad|date=June 2013|title=Kuwait's political impasse and rent-seeking behaviour: A call for institutional reform|url=http://eprints.lse.ac.uk/55014/1/__Libfile_repository_Content_Kuwait%20Programme_AL-Zumai_2013.pdf|journal=Kuwait Programme on Development, Governance and Globalisation in the Gulf States|publisher=[[London School of Economics]]|volume=29|pages=1\u201333|accessdate=1 January 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181101201839/http://eprints.lse.ac.uk/55014/1/__Libfile_repository_Content_Kuwait%20Programme_AL-Zumai_2013.pdf|archive-date=1 November 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>\n* In some countries where politics are otherwise traditionally partisan, such as the [[United States]], subnational bodies and offices such as the [[Nebraska Legislature]] and various directly-elected judicial and executive positions are nonpartisan and require politicians to abstain from running for office as part of a political party, even if they may be a member of one.\n* In some countries where politics is otherwise traditionally partisan (such as [[Mongolia]]), the incumbent President must always be an independent and cannot run for reelection as a member of a political party.\n\nSome independent politicians may be associated with a political party, perhaps as former members of it, or else have views that align with it, but choose not to stand in its name, or are unable to do so because the party in question has selected another candidate. Others may belong to or support a political party at the national level but believe they should not formally represent it (and thus be subject to its policies) at another level.\n\nFatty boom boom\n\n==Australia==\n{{main|Independent politicians in Australia}}\nIndependents are a recurrent feature of the federal [[Parliament of Australia]], and they are more commonly elected to state parliaments. There have been up to five independents in every federal parliament since 1990, and independents have won twenty-eight times during national elections in that time. A large proportion of independents are former members of one of Australia's four main parties, the [[Australian Labor Party]], the [[Liberal Party of Australia]], the [[Australian Greens]], or the [[National Party of Australia]]. In 2013 a political party named the [[Australian Independents]] was registered with the [[Australian Electoral Commission]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aec.gov.au/Parties_and_Representatives/Party_Registration/Registered_parties/australian-independents.htm|title=Australian Independents|work=Australian Electoral Commission|accessdate=19 April 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150330041846/http://aec.gov.au/Parties_and_Representatives/Party_Registration/Registered_parties/australian-independents.htm|archive-date=30 March 2015|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nAt the dissolution of parliament before the [[2019 Australian federal election|2019 federal election]], four independents sat in the [[Australian House of Representatives]]: [[Andrew Wilkie]] (Member for [[Division of Denison|Denison]]), [[Cathy McGowan (politician)|Cathy McGowan]] (Member for [[Division of Indi|Indi]]), [[Kerryn Phelps]] (Member for [[Division of Wentworth|Wentworth]]), and [[Julia Banks]] (Member for [[Division of Chisholm|Chisholm]]). Of these, Wilkie had previously been a Greens candidate, McGowan had been a Liberal staffer, and Banks was elected as a Liberal MP before resigning from the party in November 2018. At the 2019 election, Wilkie was re-elected as the Member for [[Division of Clark|Clark]], while McGowan retired, and both Phelps and Banks lost their seats. However, two new independents entered parliament: [[Zali Steggall]] (Member for [[Division of Warringah|Warringah]]) and [[Helen Haines]] (Member for [[Division of Indi|Indi]]).\n\nIndependent [[Australian Senate|Senators]] are quite rare. In modern politics, Independent [[Brian Harradine]] served from 1975 to 2005 with considerable influence at times. [[Nick Xenophon]] has been the only elected independent Senator since his election to the Senate at the [[2007 Australian federal election|2007 federal election]]. Xenophon was re-elected for another six-year term at the [[2013 Australian federal election|2013 federal election]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/federal-election-2013/results/senate/sa/|title=Senate Results: South Australia|work=ABC News|accessdate=19 April 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151021234552/http://www.abc.net.au/news/federal-election-2013/results/senate/sa/|archive-date=21 October 2015|url-status=live}}</ref> [[Democratic Labour Party (Australia)|DLP]] Senator [[John Madigan (Australian politician)|John Madigan]] became an independent Senator in September 2014,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aph.gov.au/Senators_and_Members/Parliamentarian?MPID=217571|title=Senator John Madigan|publisher=|accessdate=19 April 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402084951/http://www.aph.gov.au/Senators_and_Members/Parliamentarian?MPID=217571|archive-date=2 April 2015|url-status=live}}</ref> while [[Palmer United Party|PUP]] Senators [[Jacqui Lambie]] and [[Glenn Lazarus]] became Independent Senators in November 2014 and March 2015.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aph.gov.au/Senators_and_Members/Parliamentarian?MPID=250026|title=Senator Jacqui Lambie|publisher=APH|accessdate=19 April 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141029022640/http://www.aph.gov.au/Senators_and_Members/Parliamentarian?MPID=250026|archive-date=29 October 2014|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{citation|title=Senator Glenn Lazarus|publisher=APH}}</ref>\n\n== Azerbaijan ==\nIn [[Azerbaijan]], there are many independent members of the [[National Assembly (Azerbaijan)|National Assembly]], such as [[Ayt\u0259n Mustafayeva]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-34692390|title=Azerbaijan ruling party wins election|date=2015-11-01|work=BBC News|access-date=2020-01-29|language=en-GB}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.meclis.gov.az/?/az/deputat/209|title=Milli M\u0259clis|website=www.meclis.gov.az|access-date=2020-01-29}}</ref>\n\n==Brazil==\nIndependent politicians are not allowed to run for office in Brazil.

Radev was elected in the [[2016 Bulgarian presidential election|2016 election]].\n\n==Canada==\n{{see also|Independent Liberal|Independent Conservative}}\nIndependent Members of Parliament were numerous in the last decades of the 19th century but diminished as the party system solidified. It remained common, however, to have a small number of [[Independent Liberal]] or [[Independent Conservative]] MPs into the 1950s. Today, election as an independent is far more common at the municipal level. Many municipalities have no tradition of political parties.\n\nCandidates in federal elections who are not affiliated with a party have two options: independent or no affiliation. In the former case, they appear on the ballot with \"Independent\" following their name; in the second case, they appear with their name only. The two options are otherwise equivalent.\n\nIndependent politicians have on occasion held considerable sway in the [[House of Commons of Canada]] in recent years, as Canada has been governed by successive [[minority government]]s with independent [[Member of parliament|Members of Parliament]] (MPs) sometimes sharing in the [[balance of power (parliament)|balance of power]]. In the [[2004 Canadian federal election|2004 federal election]], [[Chuck Cadman]] was elected to federal parliament as an independent MP representing the [[British Columbia]] [[Riding (division)|riding]] of [[Surrey North]]. Independent [[Andr\u00e9 Arthur]] was elected in the [[Quebec]] riding of [[Portneuf\u2014Jacques-Cartier]] in the [[2006 Canadian federal election|2006 federal election]], and was the only independent to win a seat in that election; he was re-elected in the [[2008 Canadian federal election|2008 federal election]]. MP [[Bill Casey]], who had been expelled from the Conservative Party for voting against the 2007 budget, also ran as an independent in 2008 and retained his seat. In the [[2019 Canadian federal election|2019 federal election]], MP [[Jody Wilson-Raybould]] ran as an independent candidate in the riding of [[Vancouver Granville]] after being expelled from the Liberal Party over the [[SNC-Lavalin affair]]. She was returned to Parliament with 32% of the vote.\n\nThe territorial legislatures of the [[Northwest Territories]] and [[Nunavut]] are [[consensus government]]s with no political parties. All members sit as independents. There are a few independent members of the other provincial and territorial legislatures, which are similar in principle to the federal House of Commons; for example, in the [[2009 British Columbia general election]], independent candidate [[Vicki Huntington]] narrowly defeated incumbent [[Attorney General of British Columbia|Attorney General]] [[Wally Oppal]] in [[Delta South]].\n\n==Hong Kong==\nMore than half of Hong Kong's [[Legislative Council (Hong Kong)|Legislative Council]] is made up of independents, or members whose political groups are represented by one sole member in the legislature. They are common in [[Functional constituency (Hong Kong)|functional constituencies]], and are not rare among [[geographical constituencies]].\n\n==Croatia==\nAfter an inconclusive election in [[2015 Croatian parliamentary election|2015]], [[Tihomir Ore\u0161kovi\u0107 (politician)|Tihomir Ore\u0161kovi\u0107]] was named the first non-partisan [[Prime Minister of Croatia]].\n\n==Finland==\nAfter serving six years on his first term as [[President of Finland]] in the [[National Coalition Party]] from 2012 to 2018, [[Sauli Niinist\u00f6]] was elected for his second term in 2018 after running as an independent candidate.\n\n==France==\nIn France, independent politicians are frequently categorised as ''sans \u00e9tiquette'' (\"without label\") in municipal or district elections.\n\nIn the nineteenth-century and first half of the twentieth century, most French national politicians were independents. The first modern French political parties date from the early 1900s (foundation of [[Popular Liberal Action|Action Lib\u00e9rale]] and the [[Radical Socialist Republican Party|Radical-Socialist Republican Party]]). The first legislation on political parties dates from 1911, though it was not until 1928 that parliamentarians were required to select a political party for the parliamentary register (either by formally joining a group, or by loosely working with one as an ''apparent\u00e9'', or associate), and not until after 1945 that structured political parties came to dominate parliamentary work.\n\nOnce elected, independents tended to attach themselves to a parliamentary party. In some cases independen deputies banded together to form a technical group of their own. In 1932, for instance, there were four technical groups created: the left-of-centre [[Independent Left (France)|Independent Left]], with 12 deputies; the centre-right liberal [[Independents of the Left]], with 26 deputies; the right-wing [[Agrarianism|agrarian]] [[Independents of Economic, Social and Peasant Action|Independents for Economic, Social and Peasant Action]], with six deputies; and the far-right [[Monarchism in France|monarchist]] [[Republican Independents|Independent Group]], with 12 deputies - these four technical groups thus accounted for one-tenth of deputies. In addition, the larger parliamentary parties, including the socialist SFIO, centre-left PRRRS, centre-right ARD and conservative FR all included a greater or lesser number of independents who sat with their group for parliamentary work (''apparent\u00e9s'').\n\nIn 1920, [[Alexandre Millerand]] was elected [[President of France|president of the Republic]] under the banner \"without label\".\n\nHowever, it is nowadays rare to have independent politicians at national level, if only because independents usually affiliate themselves to an existing political grouping. Noteworthy independents include [[Jos\u00e9 Bov\u00e9]] in the 2007 presidential election. [[Emmanuel Macron]] was an independent politician as Minister, but formed his own party to stand in the 2016 presidential election.\n\nFrom 2001 to 2008 \"without label\" was no longer used in the nomenclature of the [[Minister of the Interior (France)|Ministry of the Interior]]. Candidates and lists presenting themselves as \"without label\" are classified in DVG (various left), DVD (various right), DVC (various center) or AUT (other) according to their political sensitivity. Therefore, from 2008 onwards, the DIV (miscellaneous) or the LDIV code for the \"miscellaneous\" list has been created to group unclassifiable or categorical interests and, by default, mayors without a declared label claiming no political sensitivity, be it left, center or right. The AUT (other) grade replaces the DIV grade without changing its definition.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.senat.fr/basile/visio.do?id=qSEQ080103109|title=Site du s\u00e9nat|website=senat.fr|access-date=2017-02-25|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190323092412/http://www.senat.fr/basile/visio.do?id=qSEQ080103109|archive-date=2019-03-23|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n==Georgia==\n[[Salome Zourabichvili]] won the [[2018 Georgian presidential election]] as an independent candidate, becoming the first-ever female [[President of Georgia]].\n\n==Germany==\n[[Joachim Gauck]], [[President of Germany]] from March 2012 to March 2017 and the first Federal President without party affiliation, was to date the most prominent independent politician. In the [[2010 German presidential election|German presidential election of 2010]] he was the candidate of the  [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|Social Democrats]] and [[Alliance '90/The Greens|Greens]], in [[2012 German presidential election|2012]] the candidate of all major parties except [[The Left (Germany)|The Left]]. His presidency\u2014though his powers are limited\u2014constitutes an exception, as Independent politicians have rarely held high office in German history, at least not since [[World War II]]. It has nevertheless happened that a presidential candidate without any chances of election by the [[Federal Convention (Germany)|Federal Convention]] was not a party member: for example, when in 1984 the Greens came up with the writer [[Luise Rinser]].\n\nIn the [[Bundestag]] parliament nearly all deputies belong to a political party. The voting system of [[mixed-member proportional representation|personalized proportional representation]] (since 1949) allows any individual holding the [[suffrage|passive right to vote]] to stand for a direct [[Mandate (politics)|mandate]] in the [[electoral districts]]\u2014299 of the seats in parliament are distributed by districts according to a [[plurality voting system]]. Such a candidate has to present 200 signatures in favor of his candidacy, the same as a candidate of a party that had no parliamentary presentation previously. The first [[1949 West German federal election|Bundestag election in 1949]] saw three independents elected; since then, no party-independent candidate has won a seat.<ref>[http://www.wahlrecht.de/lexikon/parteilose.html Unabh\u00e4ngige Direktkandidaten] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190409045602/http://www.wahlrecht.de/lexikon/parteilose.html |date=2019-04-09 }}, last seen October 13th, 2012.</ref> At [[States of Germany|state]] level, the situation is more or less the same: only party members have a real chance to be elected to a [[Landtag]] legislature, and state ministers without party membership are just as rare as at the federal level. However, in [[local election]]s it may occur that an independent politician is elected deputy to [[Districts of Germany|districts]]', cities' and municipalities' assemblies, as well as member of a [[city council]] or even [[mayor]], especially in [[Northern Germany]]. In recent years, independents have formed [[Free Voters]] associations to enter Landtag parliaments, so far only successful in [[Landtag of Bavaria|Bavaria]].\n\nAn independent member of parliament, who also is not a member of a voters' association, holds the status of a ''[[non-inscrit]]'' ({{lang-de|fraktionsloser Abgeordneter}}) not affiliated to any [[parliamentary group]]. A representative who leaves his party (and his parliamentary group) and does not join another becomes an independent and ''non-inscrit''. In 1989 the Bundestag MP [[Thomas W\u00fcppesahl]], who had left the Green Party in 1987 and was excluded from the Green parliamentary group the next year, obtained more rights as a non-inscrit, for example more talking time and representation in a subcommittee, when the [[Federal Constitutional Court of Germany|Federal Constitutional Court]] decided partially in his favor.\n\nAfter the [[Unification of Germany|German unification]] of 1871, the first [[Chancellor of Germany|Reich Chancellors]] ([[head of government|heads of government]]) ''de jure'' served as [[executive officer]]s of the [[German Empire|German Imperial states]] as non-partisans, usually recruited from the traditional bureaucratic, aristocratic and/or military elites. In the fierce political conflicts during the [[Weimar Republic|Weimar]] period after [[World War I]], several chancellors and Reich Ministers also had no party affiliation: these chancellors were [[Wilhelm Cuno]] (1922\u20131923), [[Hans Luther]] (1925\u20131926), the former [[Centre Party (Germany)|Centre]] politician [[Franz von Papen]] (1932), and [[Kurt von Schleicher]] (1932\u20131933). The last two [[Cabinet of Germany|cabinets]] appointed by Reich President [[Paul von Hindenburg]], a non-partisan (though strongly [[Conservatism in Germany|Conservative]]) himself, were regarded as apolitical cabinets of experts with regard to the rise of the [[Nazi Party]]; many of the ministers were not party members.\n\nSince World War II, only two ministers of (West) German cabinets have not been party members, though \"on the ticket\" of the major party in the coalition, the Social Democrats: Education Minister [[Hans Leussink]] (1969\u20131972), and Minister of Economy [[Werner M\u00fcller (politician)|Werner M\u00fcller]] (1998\u20132002). Minister of Justice [[Klaus Kinkel]] only shortly after his appointment joined the [[Free Democratic Party (Germany)|Free Democrats]] in 1991. A special case is the former Federal Minister and Chancellor [[Ludwig Erhard]], whose affiliation with the [[Christian Democratic Union (Germany)|Christian Democratic Union]] (CDU) has not been conclusively established: although he served as Minister of Economics from 1949 to 1963 and as Federal Chancellor from 1963 to 1966, and was even elected CDU [[party chair]]man in 1966, it seems that he never signed a membership form or paid contributions. Researches by ''[[Der Stern]]'' magazine have revealed a record at the CDU party archives created only in 1968, with the faked date of entry of early March 1949.<ref>[http://www.stern.de/politik/deutschland/cdu-altkanzler-ludwig-erhard-war-nie-cdu-mitglied-587764.html Stern: Ludwig Erhard war nie CDU-Mitglied] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131026225840/http://www.stern.de/politik/deutschland/cdu-altkanzler-ludwig-erhard-war-nie-cdu-mitglied-587764.html |date=2013-10-26 }}, April 25th, 2007, last seen August 7th, 2012.</ref>\n\n==Iceland==\nThe [[President of Iceland]] (currently [[Gu\u00f0ni Th. J\u00f3hannesson]]) is independent.\n\n==India==\nIndependent candidate contest elections on the basis of their personal appeal or to promote an ideology different from any party. This is right\n\n==Ireland==\n{{Main|Independent politicians in Ireland}}\nIn Ireland, proportional representation, the comparative looseness of formal parties, and strong local sentiment have meant that independents have formed a significant part of the parliamentary landscape since the [[Irish Free State|foundation of the]] state: in the early elections to [[D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann (Irish Free State)|D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann]] (parliament), independents accounted for [[1922 Irish general election|7% of seats in 1922]], [[1923 Irish general election|8.5% in 1923]], [[June 1927 Irish general election|10.5% in 1927]], and [[1932 Irish general election|9% in 1932]], though with the development of relatively more structured parties their numbers declined thereafter. These were similar proportions to the number of independents elected to other interwar European democracies such as France (see above).\n\nIt was not until the 2010s that independents would see a similar electoral success, with record scores for independents surpassing the previous interwar highs.\n\nAfter the [[2016 Irish general election|Irish general election in 2016]], there were 19 independent [[Teachta\u00ed D\u00e1la|TDs]] (parliamentary deputies) in the [[D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann|D\u00e1il]] (the lower house of the Irish parliament), representing 12% of the total. Two technical groups were formed by independent deputies to coordinate their activities: the [[Independents4Change]], with four deputies, opposed the government, while the [[Independent Alliance (Ireland)|Independent Alliance]] formed part of the minority government's working majority. A number of other individual independents similarly supported the government, and received cabinet positions.\n\nThere are fourteen independent senators in the [[Members of the 25th Seanad|25th]] [[Seanad \u00c9ireann|Seanad]] (the upper house of the Irish parliament), representing 23% of the total. Three of these are elected by the graduates of the [[National University of Ireland]] and two from [[Trinity College Dublin|Dublin University]]. There are also five independent senators who were nominated by the [[Taoiseach]] and four elected by the technical panels.\n\n==Italy==\nThe Prime Ministers [[Carlo Azeglio Ciampi]] (1993\u20131994), [[Lamberto Dini]] (1995\u20131996), [[Giuliano Amato]] (2000\u20132001), [[Mario Monti]] (2011\u20132013) and [[Giuseppe Conte]] (2018\u2013present) were independent when they were in office. Ciampi was also the [[President of the Italian Republic]] between 1999 and 2006. President [[Sergio Mattarella]], despite being a former member of the [[Christian Democracy (Italy)|Christian Democracy]] and of the [[Democratic Party (Italy)|Democratic Party]], was elected President in 2015 as an independent.\n\n==Malaysia==\nIndependents have rarely been elected to the [[Dewan Rakyat]] and state legislative assemblies. In Malaysian elections, many independent candidates lose their election deposit because they had failed to secure at least 12.5% or one-eighth of the total votes cast. Independent [[List of members of the Dewan Negara|Senators]] are quite rare.\n\nIn 2010, a group of independent MPs who were sacked from the [[People's Justice Party]] formed a political block called ''[[:ms:Konsensus Bebas|Konsensus Bebas]]''.<ref>[https://weechookeong.com/2010/06/07/konsensus-bebas-formed/ Formation of KONSENSUS BEBAS] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180419184124/https://weechookeong.com/2010/06/07/konsensus-bebas-formed/ |date=2018-04-19 }} (media statement)</ref> The members were [[Zahrain Mohamed Hashim]] (Bayan Baru), [[Wee Choo Keong]] (Wangsa Maju), [[Zulkifli Noordin]] (Kulim-Bandar Bharu), [[Tan Tee Beng]] (Nibong Tebal) dan [[Mohsin Fadzli Samsuri]] (Bagan Serai). It did not last beyond the 12th General Elections.\n\n{{as of|May 2018}}, three independent MPs were elected in [[Malaysian General Election|GE14]], but later joining [[Pakatan Harapan]] ([[People's Justice Party (Malaysia)|PKR]]), thus causing no representation for independent MP for that time. However, as of June 2018 and December 2018, the number increased to 13 independent Members of Parliament that now currently sit in the [[Dewan Rakyat]] as of December 2018.\n\nAt the same time in December 2018, almost all member from Sabah [[UMNO]] quit the party and became independent politicians.\n\n==Mexico==\n[[Jaime Rodr\u00edguez Calder\u00f3n|Jaime Heliodoro Rodr\u00edguez Calder\u00f3n]] (born in 1957), sometimes referred to by his nickname \"El Bronco\", is a [[Mexico|Mexican]] politician who is the current governor for the northern state of [[Nuevo Le\u00f3n]] and holds no political party affiliation. {{as of|2015|June|7|df=US}} elected Governor for Nuevo Le\u00f3n, making history as the first independent candidate to win in the country.\n\n==New Zealand==\nOriginally, there were no recognised parties in the New Zealand parliament, although loose groupings did exist informally (initially between supporters of central government versus provincial governments, and later between liberals and conservatives). The foundation of formal political parties, starting at the end of the 19th century, considerably diminished the number of unaffiliated politicians, although a smaller number of independent candidates continued to be elected up until the 1940s. Since then, however, there have been relatively few independent politicians in Parliament. No independent candidate has won or held a seat in a general election since [[1943 New Zealand general election|1943]], although two independent candidates have been successful in [[by-election]]s (in all cases after having held the seats in question as partisan candidates up until that point). Other politicians have become independents in the course of a parliamentary term, but not been voted into office as such.\n\nThe last person to be directly elected to Parliament as an independent in New Zealand was [[Winston Peters]], who won the {{By-election link|Tauranga|1993}} in {{NZ electorate link|Tauranga}} electorate as an independent after having previously held it a member of the [[New Zealand National Party|National Party]]. By the time of the [[1993 New Zealand general election|next general election]], he had formed his own party ([[New Zealand First]]), and thus was no longer standing as an independent. Since that time, the only independents in Parliament have been people who quit or were expelled from their original party  but retained their seats without going through a by-election. Some have gone on to found or co-found their own parties, with varying levels of success \u2014 examples include [[Peter Dunne]], [[Taito Phillip Field]], [[Gordon Copeland]], [[Tau Henare]], and [[Alamein Kopu]]. Others have joined parties which were then outside Parliament, such as [[Frank Grover]] and [[Tuariki Delamere]].\n\nThere were two independent MPs in the [[49th New Zealand Parliament]]; [[Chris Carter (politician)|Chris Carter]] and [[Hone Harawira]]. Carter became an independent after his criticisms of the [[New Zealand Labour Party|Labour Party]]'s leadership resulted in his being expelled from the Labour caucus, while Harawira resigned from the [[M\u0101ori Party]] and, after a short period as an independent, also resigned as an MP in order to force the {{By-election link|Te Tai Tokerau|2011}} when he was re-elected as representative of his new political party, [[Mana Party (New Zealand)|Mana]] and retained the seat in the 2011 General Election. There were also two other parties which had only a single MP: [[United Future]] with [[Peter Dunne]] and [[ACT New Zealand|ACT]] with [[David Seymour (New Zealand politician)|David Seymour]]. Neither Dunne nor Seymour was classed as an independent \u2014 Dunne's presence in Parliament was due to personal votes in his home electorate, and Seymour's presence was as the sole elected MP of ACT because of a collapse in their support in the {{NZ election link|2011}}. In the [[50th New Zealand Parliament]] there was one independent MP: [[Brendan Horan]], a former New Zealand First MP who was expelled from his party because of allegations of misappropriation of family assets.\n\nPeter Dunne effectively became an Independent MP for a short period after his United Future political party was deregistered on 25 June 2013 by the Electoral Commission, as the party no longer had the required minimum of 500 members. The party was subsequently re-registered.\n\n==Niue==\nIn [[Niue]], there have been no political parties since 2003, when the [[Niue People's Party]] disbanded, and all politicians are ''de facto'' independents. The government depends on an informal coalition.\n\n==Pakistan==\nPakistan also has independent politicians standing in elections. Pakistan's Parliament has [[2008 Pakistani general election|General Elections, 2008]] elected 30 Members. In the 2011 four candidates won seats in the National Assembly. In the 2013 General Election nine seats were won by independents.\n\n==Philippines==\n[[Noli de Castro]], the Philippines' former [[Vice President of the Philippines|vice president]], [[2001 Philippine general election|ran as senator]] in 2001 with no political party affiliation. He was a guest candidate of the opposition [[Pwersa ng Masang Pilipino|Pwersa ng Masa coalition]] but he never joined their campaign rallies. He won in the senate race with the highest votes (then) in Philippine history. In 2004, he ran [[2004 Philippine presidential election|as vice president]] as a guest candidate of the administration [[Koalisyon ng Katapatan at Karanasan sa Kinabukasan|K-4 coalition]] and won with just under majority of the vote.\n\nStarting in 2001, several [[Senate of the Philippines|senators]] had also resigned from their respective parties to become independents; at the start of the [[15th Congress of the Philippines|15th Congress]], there were more independent senators than any other single political party. However, in contesting elections, all elected independents had been members of either the administration or the opposition coalition, until in the [[2007 Philippine Senate election|2007 Senate election]] when [[Gregorio Honasan]] (a former senator) was elected as an independent while not a being member of any coalition. Honasan was earlier [[1995 Philippine Senate election|elected in 1995]] as an independent candidate and being adopted by the [[Nationalist People's Coalition]]-led coalition to become the first elected independent senator since [[Magnolia Antonino]] in [[1967 Philippine Senate election|1967]], although Antonino was a guest candidate of the [[Liberal Party (Philippines)|Liberal Party]] then.\n\nIn the local level, former priest [[Eddie Panlilio]] was elected as governor of [[Pampanga]] in 2007, defeating two administration candidates. When Panlilio eventually transferred to the Liberal Party in time for the 2010 election, it was ruled that he was beaten in the 2007 election; in 2010, he was defeated.\n\nIn the [[2010 Philippine House of Representatives elections|2010 House of Representatives elections]], seven independents were elected, although all but two joined a political party after the elections.\n\nIn contesting elections, independent candidates are required by law to spend less than candidates nominated by a party.\n\n==Poland==\nThe Polish [[Sejm]] is elected by party-list ordination, which does not allow lone candidates to run, although since 2001 there has been a possibility to create non-partisan ''Voters' Electoral Committee'' (pol. ''KWW'', ''komitet wyborczy wyborc\u00f3w''); they are by almost any means party lists, but no officially registered party is behind them. They can be unregistered parties, e.g. [[Kukiz'15]], or non-partisan movements, although the latter never reached the 5% threshold. National minorities candidates also form Voters' Electoral Committees (like [[German Minority Electoral Committee]], represented in Sejm since 1991), but they do not have to reach the nationwide threshold. However, during a Sejm term many members switch parties or become independents.\n\nTickets such as [[Civic Platform]] during the [[2001 Polish parliamentary election|2001 election]] were formally non-partisan, Civic Platform was widely viewed as a de facto political party, as it is now.\n\nThe situation in the [[Senate of Poland|Senate]] is different, as the voting system allows independents to run as single candidates and some are elected in their own right. In the last parliamentary election ([[2015 Polish parliamentary election|2015]]) four independents won seats in the Senate.\n\nThree [[President of Poland|Presidents]] since 1990 have technically been independents. [[Lech Wa\u0142\u0119sa]] was not an endorsed candidate of any party, but the chairman of the [[Solidarity (Polish trade union)|Solidarity]] and he was elected without full support of this union (Solidarity votes split between him and [[Prime Minister of Poland|Prime Minister]] [[Tadeusz Mazowiecki]]). [[Aleksander Kwa\u015bniewski]] was a leader of the [[Social Democracy of the Republic of Poland]], but formally resigned from the party after he was elected, as did [[Lech Kaczy\u0144ski]], who was the first leader of [[Law and Justice]], [[Bronis\u0142aw Komorowski]] ([[Civic Platform|PO]]) and [[Andrzej Duda]] ([[Law and Justice|PiS]]). The resignation is required because the Constitution says that the president shall hold no other offices nor discharge any public functions.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sejm.gov.pl/prawo/konst/angielski/konse.htm#5 |title=The Constitution of the Republic of Poland |publisher=Sejm |accessdate=31 March 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170216093821/http://sejm.gov.pl/prawo/konst/angielski/konse.htm#5 |archive-date=16 February 2017 |url-status=live }}</ref> The aforementioned presidents often participated in their party's campaigns (e.g. Andrzej Duda in the Law and Justice campaign three months after his resignation from the party).\n\n==Portugal==\n[[Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa]], the current [[president of Portugal]] since 6 March 2016, was elected on 24 January 2016 while being a leading member of the [[Social Democratic Party (Portugal)|Social Democratic Party]], but suspended his [[political affiliation]] on the day of his [[Swearing in|swearing-in]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://observador.pt/2016/04/01/marcelo-rebelo-sousa-suspendeu-militancia-do-psd/|title=Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa suspendeu a milit\u00e2ncia no PSD|last=Valente|first=Liliana|date=2016-04-01|work=Observador|access-date=2019-09-15|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160417025221/http://observador.pt/2016/04/01/marcelo-rebelo-sousa-suspendeu-militancia-do-psd/|archive-date=2016-04-17|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n==Russia==\nAll of Russia's [[President of Russia|Presidents]] have been independents. Former president [[Dmitry Medvedev]] declined an offer to join [[United Russia]], saying that he believes the President should be an independent so that he serves the interests of the country rather than his political party.\n\n[[Vladimir Putin]], the current president of Russia, was the head of the [[United Russia]] party until 26 May 2012, but even then was not its member, thus formally was and still is independent.\n\n==Sweden==\nThe Swedish election system is based on parties nominating candidate MPs for their party ballots, and each party has to receive 4% or more of the national vote (or 12% in one region, which has never happened). This makes running as an independent MP impossible. Once elected, the seat is personal; MPs may resign their party membership, or be stripped of it, while retaining their Riksdag seats to become independent to become what is commonly referred to as a ''politisk vilde'' (''political savage'').\n\nIn the executive branch, there is no requirement for ministers to be MPs, or even have a political affiliation (though this has overwhelmingly been the case in modern times). This means that even the prime minister could technically be an independent if chosen by the Riksdag.\n\n==Taiwan==\nAfter the [[2018 Taiwanese local elections]], there is only one independent local head:\n* [[Ko Wen-je]], Mayor of [[Taipei]].\nIn 2019, Ko Wen-je founded the [[Taiwan People's Party]], so there is no independent local head at the moment.\n\n==United Kingdom==\n\nThe [[Registration of Political Parties Act 1998]] laid down the first specific rules in the United Kingdom relating to the use of the term 'independent' by election candidates. That Act was repealed with most of its contents covered by Part II of the [[Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Act 2000]]. Candidates standing for United Kingdom local elections and United Kingdom parliamentary elections, including the devolved assemblies, can use the name of a registered political party, or the term 'Independent' (or its Welsh language equivalent ''annibynol'') or no ballot paper description at all<ref>{{cite web|title=Introduction to standing as a candidate|url=http://www.electoralcommission.org.uk/__data/assets/pdf_file/0003/164109/intro-candidate.pdf|publisher=Electoral Commission|accessdate=10 November 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170202014634/http://www.electoralcommission.org.uk/__data/assets/pdf_file/0003/164109/intro-candidate.pdf|archive-date=2 February 2017|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Electoral Administration Bill|url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmbills/050/en/06050x-c.htm|website=United Kingdom parliament|publisher=United Kingdom parliament|accessdate=10 November 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161110235148/http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmbills/050/en/06050x-c.htm|archive-date=10 November 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> (this latter choice was used, for example, by David Icke at the [[2008 Haltemprice and Howden by-election]]).\n\nSome groups in the United Kingdom who are not affiliated to any national or regional party have registered locality-based political parties.

[[S. O. Davies]], a veteran [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] MP, held his [[Merthyr Tydfil]] seat in the General Election of 1970, standing as an independent, after he had been deselected by the Labour Party.\n\nJournalist [[Martin Bell]] was elected at [[Tatton (UK Parliament constituency)|Tatton]] in the [[1997 United Kingdom general election|general election of 1997]], having stood on an anti-corruption platform, defeating incumbent [[Neil Hamilton (politician)|Neil Hamilton]]. He was the first independent to be newly elected to the Commons since 1951.<ref name=\"GuardianMartinBell\">[[Martin Bell]]'s 1997 election was the first election of an Independent in the UK since 1951: {{cite news | url=https://www.theguardian.com/global/2007/jun/03/martinbell | title=Martin Bell Profile | publisher=Guardian | accessdate=October 18, 2012 | location=London | date=3 June 2008 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151017203222/http://www.theguardian.com/global/2007/jun/03/martinbell | archive-date=17 October 2015 | url-status=live }}</ref> He stood unsuccessfully in a different constituency in 2001.\n\nAt the [[2001 United Kingdom general election|2001 General Election]], [[Richard Taylor (UK politician)|Dr Richard Taylor]] of the [[Independent Kidderminster Hospital and Health Concern]] party was elected for the constituency of [[Wyre Forest (UK Parliament constituency)|Wyre Forest]]. Taylor was re-elected for Wyre Forest at the [[2005 United Kingdom general election|2005 General Election]], becoming the only independent in recent times to have been elected for a second term.\n\nTwo independent (or local party) members of parliament were elected in the [[2005 United Kingdom general election|2005 election]], although both were defeated five years later. In the same election, [[Peter Law]] was elected as an independent at [[Blaenau Gwent (UK Parliament constituency)|Blaenau Gwent]]. Law died on 25 April 2006: the resulting [[2006 Blaenau Gwent by-elections|by-election]] elected [[Dai Davies (politician)|Dai Davies]] of the local party [[Blaenau Gwent People's Voice]]. The by-election was unusual as it was the first time in over eighty years that an independent had held a seat previously occupied by another independent.\n\nOnly one independent was elected to the Commons in the [[2010 United Kingdom general election|2010]], [[2015 United Kingdom general election|2015]] and [[2017 United Kingdom general election|2017 elections]]: [[Sylvia Hermon]], the member for [[North Down (UK Parliament constituency)|North Down]], a [[Unionism in Ireland|Unionist]] who left the [[Ulster Unionist Party]] because of its links with the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservatives]].\n\nThere have also been several instances of politicians being elected to the Commons as representatives of a political party, then resigning the party's whip, or having it withdrawn. Examples in this in the 2010-2015 parliament included [[Mike Hancock (British politician)|Mike Hancock]] (formerly a Liberal Democrat), [[Eric Joyce]] (formerly Labour) and [[Nadine Dorries]], a Conservative who had the whip withdrawn for part of the parliament and thus sat as an independent during that time.\n\nIndependent candidates often stand in British parliamentary elections, often with platforms about specific local issues, but usually without  success. An example from the [[2001 United Kingdom general election|2001 general election]] was [[Aston Villa]] supporter Ian Robinson, who stood as an independent in the [[Sutton Coldfield (UK Parliament constituency)|Sutton Coldfield constituency]] in protest at the way chairman [[Doug Ellis]] ran the football club. Another example an independent candidate, in the [[Salisbury (UK Parliament constituency)|Salisbury constituency]], is [[Arthur Uther Pendragon]], a local activist and self-declared reincarnation of [[King Arthur]].\n\nOther independent candidates are associated with a political party and may be former members of it, but cannot stand under its label. For instance, after being expelled from the Labour Party but before the [[RESPECT The Unity Coalition|Respect Coalition]] was founded, British [[Member of parliament|Member of Parliament]] (MP) [[George Galloway]] described himself as \"Independent Labour\".\n\nOn 23 March 2005 the [[Independent Network]] was set up to support independent candidates in the General Election.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.independentnetwork.org.uk/Launch_news_release.html|title=Launchdate of the Independent Network|publisher=}}{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> The Independent Network still supports Independent candidates in local, regional, national and European elections. It has an organic{{clarify|date=May 2014}} set of principles which are known as the Bell Principles and are very closely related to [[Committee on Standards in Public Life|Lord Nolan's Standards of Public Life]]. The Independent Network does not impose any [[ideology]] or political influence on their candidates.\n\nIn March 2009, the multi-millionaire [[Paul Judge]] established the [[Jury Team]], an umbrella organisation dedicated to increasing the number of independent candidates standing in Britain, in both national and European elections.<ref name=Independant8Mar09>{{cite news | last = Gourlay | first = Chris | title = Tycoon finances 'X Factor' party to clean up politics | publisher = [[The Sunday Times]] | date = 2009-03-08 | url = http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/politics/article5864530.ece | accessdate = 2009-05-10 | location = London | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20090316004542/http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/politics/article5864530.ece | archive-date = 2009-03-16 | url-status = live }}</ref>\n\n====Independent and undescribed candidates====\n\nPart II of the [[Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Act 2000]] allows individuals who wish to stand as a candidate to all parliaments and assemblies in the UK, including the House of Commons, the right to use one of three ballot paper descriptions.

At the [[2007 Scottish Parliament election|2007 Scottish Parliamentary elections]] Margo MacDonald was again returned as an independent MSP and was elected as an independent for the third time [[2011 Scottish Parliament election|four years later]].

This strategy has been pursued by several other candidates for federal races, including [[Joe Lieberman]] ([[Connecticut for Lieberman]]).\n\n===Governor===\n[[Illinois]], [[Maine]], [[Oregon]], [[Rhode Island]], [[Texas]], [[Alaska]] and [[Minnesota]] have elected formally independent candidates as governor: Illinois's first two governors, [[Shadrach Bond]] and [[Edward Coles]]; [[James B. Longley]] in 1974 as well as [[Angus King]] in 1994 and 1998 from Maine; [[Lincoln Chafee]] in 2010 from Rhode Island; [[Julius Meier]] in 1930 from Oregon; [[Sam Houston]] in 1859 from Texas; and [[Bill Walker (American politician)|Bill Walker]] in 2014 from Alaska. [[Lowell P. Weicker Jr.]] is sometimes mentioned as an independent governor, though this is not technically correct; he ran as an [[A Connecticut Party]] candidate (which gave him better ballot placement than an unaffiliated candidate would receive), defeating the Democratic and Republican party nominees.  Another former governor who is sometimes mentioned as an independent is [[Jesse Ventura]], who actually ran as a member of the [[Reform Party of the United States of America|Reform Party's]] Minnesota affiliate, which later disaffiliated from the party and reverted to their original name the [[Independence Party of Minnesota]].\n\nIn 1971, State Senator [[Henry Howell]] of [[Virginia]], a former Democrat, was elected [[Lieutenant Governor of Virginia|lieutenant governor]] as an independent. Two years later, he campaigned for [[Governor of Virginia|governor]] as an independent, but lost by 15,000 votes.\n\nThere were several unsuccessful independent gubernatorial candidates in 2006 who impacted their electoral races. In [[Maine]], state legislator [[Barbara Merrill]] (formerly a Democrat) received 21% of the vote. In [[Texas]], [[country music]] singer and [[detective fiction|mystery novelist]] [[Kinky Friedman]] received 12.43% of the vote, and State [[Comptroller]] [[Carole Keeton Strayhorn]] received 18.13%. Strayhorn and Friedman's presence in the race resulted in a splitting of the ballot four ways between themselves and the two major parties.\n\nIn 2010, [[Florida]] [[Governor of Florida|governor]] [[Charlie Crist]] left the Republican party and became Independent (He later became a Democrat.)<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/10/27/charlie-crist-senate-race_n_774589.html|work=Huffington Post|title=Charlie Crist Comes Under Fire For Pulling Party Switch|date=27 October 2010|access-date=26 December 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305231220/http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/10/27/charlie-crist-senate-race_n_774589.html|archive-date=5 March 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> rather than face former [[Florida House of Representatives|state house]] [[Speaker of the Florida House of Representatives|Speaker]] [[Marco Rubio]] in the Republican primary (Rubio won, though Crist came in ahead of Democratic nominee [[Kendrick Meek]]).\n\nIn 2014, former [[Honolulu]] mayor [[Mufi Hannemann]] ran as an independent candidate for the [[Governor of Hawaii|governorship]] of the State of [[Hawaii]] after previously campaigning in the state's Democratic primary. As a result, Democratic candidate [[David Ige]] was elected as governor with a plurality of 49%.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.kitv.com/politics/ige-takes-early-lead-in-hawaii-governors-race/29545058|title=Democrat David Ige elected Hawaii governor|date=4 November 2014|url-status = dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141105212441/http://www.kitv.com/politics/ige-takes-early-lead-in-hawaii-governors-race/29545058|archivedate=5 November 2014|df=}}</ref>\n\n===Congress \u2013 House of Representatives and Senate===\nThere have been several independents elected to the [[United States Senate]] throughout history. Notable examples include [[David Davis (Supreme Court justice)|David Davis]] of [[Illinois]] (a former [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]]) in the 19th century, and [[Harry F. Byrd Jr.]] of [[Virginia]] (who had been elected to his first term as a Democrat) in the 20th century.  Some officials have been elected as members of a party but became independent while in office (without being elected as such), such as [[Wayne Morse]] of [[Oregon]]. [[Nebraska]] senator [[George W. Norris]] was elected for four terms as a Republican before changing to an independent after the Republicans lost their majority in Congress in 1930. Norris won re-election as an independent in 1936, but later lost his final re-election attempt to Republican [[Kenneth S. Wherry]] in 1942. [[Vermont]] senator [[Jim Jeffords]] left the Republican Party to become an independent in 2001. Jeffords's [[party switching|change of party status]] was especially significant because it shifted the Senate composition from 50-50 between the Republicans and Democrats (with a Republican [[Vice President of the United States|Vice President]], [[Dick Cheney]], who would presumably break all ties in favor of the Republicans), to 49 Republicans, 50 Democrats, and one Independent. Jeffords agreed to vote for Democratic control of the Senate in exchange for being appointed chairman of the [[U.S. Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works|Senate Environment and Public Works Committee]], and the Democrats held control of the Senate until the [[2002 U.S. Senate election|Congressional elections in 2002]], when the Republicans regained their majority. Jeffords retired at the end of his term in 2007. Wayne Morse after two years as an independent became a Democrat. [[Dean Barkley]] of the [[Independence Party of Minnesota]] was appointed a day before the 2002 elections to fill the senate seat of [[Paul Wellstone]] who, while running for re-election, died weeks prior. Barkley refused to caucus with either party.\n\nSenator Bernie Sanders is the longest-serving independent member of Congress in American history.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://news.yahoo.com/bernie-sanders-president-democrat-145640890.html |title=Vermont Independent Sen.

Sanders later won the open Senate seat of [[Jim Jeffords]] as an independent. [[Joe Lieberman]] is a former [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] who, like [[Lowell P. Weicker Jr.]], ran under a third party ([[Connecticut for Lieberman|Connecticut for Lieberman Party]]) in the [[2006 Connecticut United States Senate election|2006 election]]. Though both representatives are technically independent politicians, they often caucus with the Democrats. In 2006, Sanders and Lieberman were the only two victorious independent candidates for Congress, both caucusing with the Democrats. In 2012 [[Angus King]] was elected to the US Senate as an Independent from Maine. {{as of|2016}}, he has typically caucused with the Democrats.\n\nThe [[United States House of Representatives]] has also seen a handful of [[Third-party members of the United States House of Representatives|independent members]]. Examples include [[Bernie Sanders]] of [[Vermont]], [[Virgil Goode]] of [[Virginia]], [[Frazier Reams]] of [[Ohio]], [[Victor Berger]] of [[Wisconsin]], and [[Justin Amash]] of [[Michigan]].\n\n===State and local offices===\nIn August 2008, there were 12 independents who held offices in state legislatures. There were four state senators, one from [[Kentucky Senate|Kentucky]], one from [[Oregon Senate|Oregon]], one from [[Tennessee Senate|Tennessee]], and one from [[New Mexico Senate|New Mexico]]. The representatives came from the states of [[Louisiana House of Representatives|Louisiana]] (two), [[Maine House of Representatives|Maine]] (two), [[Vermont House of Representatives|Vermont]] (two), and [[Virginia House of Delegates|Virginia]] (two). In the 2008 general elections, Wisconsin State Assemblyman Jeffrey Wood left the Republican Party and won reelection as an independent. After the 2008 primary election, New Mexico State Senator [[Joseph Carraro]] left the Republican Party and registered as an Independent. He did not run for reelection.\n\nIn November 2005, [[Manny Diaz (Florida politician)|Manny Diaz]] was elected Mayor of [[Miami, Florida]] as an independent.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.citymayors.com/mayors/miami_mayor.html |title=Manny Diaz - Mayor of Miami |publisher=City Mayors |date=2008-01-28 |accessdate=2010-08-29 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101104053525/http://citymayors.com/mayors/miami_mayor.html |archive-date=2010-11-04 |url-status=live }}</ref> On June 19, 2007, [[Mayor of New York City|New York Mayor]] [[Michael Bloomberg]] switched his party affiliation from Republican to independent.

In the Legislature (which is additionally unique in that it is also the only state legislature that is [[unicameral]]), there are no formal party alignments or groups and the members are nominated in nonpartisan primary elections. Members are allowed to register with political parties but choose not to reveal their affiliation while seated, as a professional courtesy. However, the political affiliation of party-affiliated members are considered [[open secret]]s and the parties exist in the legislature on an unofficial basis. Some members, such as [[Ernie Chambers]] of [[Omaha]], are independent of party officially, while others have not publicly disclosed their affiliation.\n\n==See also==\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Backbencher]]\n* [[Benjamin Franklin]]\n* [[Centrism]]\n* [[Electoral reform]]\n* [[Independence Party (disambiguation)|Independence Party]] (disambiguation page)\n* [[Independent Party (disambiguation)|Independent Party]] (disambiguation page)\n* [[Independent voter]]\n* [[Non-partisan democracy]]\n* [[Nonpartisanism]]\n* [[Radical center (politics)|Radical centrism]]\n* [[Swing vote]]\n* [[Syncretic politics]]\n* [[Third party (United States)]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n'''Notes:'''\n{|style=\"margin-left:13px; line-height:150%\"\n|align=\"right\" valign=\"top\"|a.\n|{{note|status}}{{Kosovo-note}}\n|}\n\n'''References:'''\n{{Reflist}}\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{cite news |title= Clare Short resigns as Labour MP|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/6069710.stm |accessdate= |publisher=BBC World News | date=October 20, 2006}}\n* {{cite news |title=Elected Without a Party, Lieberman Will Remain a Democrat |url=https://www.nytimes.com/cq/2006/11/08/cq_1915.html|accessdate=2006-11-08 |newspaper=New York Times | date=November 8, 2006}}\n{{refend}}\n\n==External links==\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20180326202927/http://list.indecan.org/ Independent Political Candidate Directory]\n\n[[Category:Independent politicians| ]]\n[[Category:Political terminology]]\n", "text_old": "{{distinguish|Independence Party (disambiguation) {{!}}Independence Party|Independent Group (disambiguation){{!}}Independent Group|Independent Party (disambiguation){{!}}Independent Party|American Independent Party}}\n{{short description|Individual not affiliated to any political party}}\n{{More citations needed|date=June 2019}}\nAn '''independent''' or '''nonpartisan politician''' is a politician not affiliated with any [[political party]]. There are numerous reasons why someone may stand for office as an independent.\n* Independents may support policies which are different from those of the major political parties.\n* Independents may support a party's platform, but choose to stand as an independent because they don't feel the party adequately follows their platform.\n* In some parts of the world, electors may have a tradition of electing independents, so standing for a political party is a disadvantage.\n* In some countries (such as [[Russia]]), a political party can only be registered if it has many members in more than one region, but in certain regions only a minority of electors support the major parties.\n* In some countries (such as [[Kuwait]]), political parties are illegal and all candidates thus stand as independents.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Al-Zumai|first=Fahad|date=June 2013|title=Kuwait's political impasse and rent-seeking behaviour: A call for institutional reform|url=http://eprints.lse.ac.uk/55014/1/__Libfile_repository_Content_Kuwait%20Programme_AL-Zumai_2013.pdf|journal=Kuwait Programme on Development, Governance and Globalisation in the Gulf States|publisher=[[London School of Economics]]|volume=29|pages=1\u201333|accessdate=1 January 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181101201839/http://eprints.lse.ac.uk/55014/1/__Libfile_repository_Content_Kuwait%20Programme_AL-Zumai_2013.pdf|archive-date=1 November 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>\n* In some countries where politics are otherwise traditionally partisan, such as the [[United States]], subnational bodies and offices such as the [[Nebraska Legislature]] and various directly-elected judicial and executive positions are nonpartisan and require politicians to abstain from running for office as part of a political party, even if they may be a member of one.\n* In some countries where politics is otherwise traditionally partisan (such as [[Mongolia]]), the incumbent President must always be an independent and cannot run for reelection as a member of a political party.\n\nSome independent politicians may be associated with a political party, perhaps as former members of it, or else have views that align with it, but choose not to stand in its name, or are unable to do so because the party in question has selected another candidate. Others may belong to or support a political party at the national level but believe they should not formally represent it (and thus be subject to its policies) at another level.\n\nIn running for public office, independents sometimes choose to form a party or alliance with other independents, and may formally register their party or alliance. Even where the word \"independent\" is used, such alliances have much in common with a political party, especially if there is an organization which needs to approve the \"independent\" candidates.\n\n==Australia==\n{{main|Independent politicians in Australia}}\nIndependents are a recurrent feature of the federal [[Parliament of Australia]], and they are more commonly elected to state parliaments. There have been up to five independents in every federal parliament since 1990, and independents have won twenty-eight times during national elections in that time. A large proportion of independents are former members of one of Australia's four main parties, the [[Australian Labor Party]], the [[Liberal Party of Australia]], the [[Australian Greens]], or the [[National Party of Australia]]. In 2013 a political party named the [[Australian Independents]] was registered with the [[Australian Electoral Commission]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aec.gov.au/Parties_and_Representatives/Party_Registration/Registered_parties/australian-independents.htm|title=Australian Independents|work=Australian Electoral Commission|accessdate=19 April 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150330041846/http://aec.gov.au/Parties_and_Representatives/Party_Registration/Registered_parties/australian-independents.htm|archive-date=30 March 2015|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nAt the dissolution of parliament before the [[2019 Australian federal election|2019 federal election]], four independents sat in the [[Australian House of Representatives]]: [[Andrew Wilkie]] (Member for [[Division of Denison|Denison]]), [[Cathy McGowan (politician)|Cathy McGowan]] (Member for [[Division of Indi|Indi]]), [[Kerryn Phelps]] (Member for [[Division of Wentworth|Wentworth]]), and [[Julia Banks]] (Member for [[Division of Chisholm|Chisholm]]). Of these, Wilkie had previously been a Greens candidate, McGowan had been a Liberal staffer, and Banks was elected as a Liberal MP before resigning from the party in November 2018. At the 2019 election, Wilkie was re-elected as the Member for [[Division of Clark|Clark]], while McGowan retired, and both Phelps and Banks lost their seats. However, two new independents entered parliament: [[Zali Steggall]] (Member for [[Division of Warringah|Warringah]]) and [[Helen Haines]] (Member for [[Division of Indi|Indi]]).\n\nIndependent [[Australian Senate|Senators]] are quite rare. In modern politics, Independent [[Brian Harradine]] served from 1975 to 2005 with considerable influence at times. [[Nick Xenophon]] has been the only elected independent Senator since his election to the Senate at the [[2007 Australian federal election|2007 federal election]]. Xenophon was re-elected for another six-year term at the [[2013 Australian federal election|2013 federal election]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/federal-election-2013/results/senate/sa/|title=Senate Results: South Australia|work=ABC News|accessdate=19 April 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151021234552/http://www.abc.net.au/news/federal-election-2013/results/senate/sa/|archive-date=21 October 2015|url-status=live}}</ref> [[Democratic Labour Party (Australia)|DLP]] Senator [[John Madigan (Australian politician)|John Madigan]] became an independent Senator in September 2014,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aph.gov.au/Senators_and_Members/Parliamentarian?MPID=217571|title=Senator John Madigan|publisher=|accessdate=19 April 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402084951/http://www.aph.gov.au/Senators_and_Members/Parliamentarian?MPID=217571|archive-date=2 April 2015|url-status=live}}</ref> while [[Palmer United Party|PUP]] Senators [[Jacqui Lambie]] and [[Glenn Lazarus]] became Independent Senators in November 2014 and March 2015.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aph.gov.au/Senators_and_Members/Parliamentarian?MPID=250026|title=Senator Jacqui Lambie|publisher=APH|accessdate=19 April 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141029022640/http://www.aph.gov.au/Senators_and_Members/Parliamentarian?MPID=250026|archive-date=29 October 2014|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{citation|title=Senator Glenn Lazarus|publisher=APH}}</ref>\n\n== Azerbaijan ==\nIn [[Azerbaijan]], there are many independent members of the [[National Assembly (Azerbaijan)|National Assembly]], such as [[Ayt\u0259n Mustafayeva]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-34692390|title=Azerbaijan ruling party wins election|date=2015-11-01|work=BBC News|access-date=2020-01-29|language=en-GB}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.meclis.gov.az/?/az/deputat/209|title=Milli M\u0259clis|website=www.meclis.gov.az|access-date=2020-01-29}}</ref>\n\n==Brazil==\nIndependent politicians are not allowed to run for office in Brazil.

Radev was elected in the [[2016 Bulgarian presidential election|2016 election]].\n\n==Canada==\n{{see also|Independent Liberal|Independent Conservative}}\nIndependent Members of Parliament were numerous in the last decades of the 19th century but diminished as the party system solidified. It remained common, however, to have a small number of [[Independent Liberal]] or [[Independent Conservative]] MPs into the 1950s. Today, election as an independent is far more common at the municipal level. Many municipalities have no tradition of political parties.\n\nCandidates in federal elections who are not affiliated with a party have two options: independent or no affiliation. In the former case, they appear on the ballot with \"Independent\" following their name; in the second case, they appear with their name only. The two options are otherwise equivalent.\n\nIndependent politicians have on occasion held considerable sway in the [[House of Commons of Canada]] in recent years, as Canada has been governed by successive [[minority government]]s with independent [[Member of parliament|Members of Parliament]] (MPs) sometimes sharing in the [[balance of power (parliament)|balance of power]]. In the [[2004 Canadian federal election|2004 federal election]], [[Chuck Cadman]] was elected to federal parliament as an independent MP representing the [[British Columbia]] [[Riding (division)|riding]] of [[Surrey North]]. Independent [[Andr\u00e9 Arthur]] was elected in the [[Quebec]] riding of [[Portneuf\u2014Jacques-Cartier]] in the [[2006 Canadian federal election|2006 federal election]], and was the only independent to win a seat in that election; he was re-elected in the [[2008 Canadian federal election|2008 federal election]]. MP [[Bill Casey]], who had been expelled from the Conservative Party for voting against the 2007 budget, also ran as an independent in 2008 and retained his seat. In the [[2019 Canadian federal election|2019 federal election]], MP [[Jody Wilson-Raybould]] ran as an independent candidate in the riding of [[Vancouver Granville]] after being expelled from the Liberal Party over the [[SNC-Lavalin affair]]. She was returned to Parliament with 32% of the vote.\n\nThe territorial legislatures of the [[Northwest Territories]] and [[Nunavut]] are [[consensus government]]s with no political parties. All members sit as independents. There are a few independent members of the other provincial and territorial legislatures, which are similar in principle to the federal House of Commons; for example, in the [[2009 British Columbia general election]], independent candidate [[Vicki Huntington]] narrowly defeated incumbent [[Attorney General of British Columbia|Attorney General]] [[Wally Oppal]] in [[Delta South]].\n\n==Hong Kong==\nMore than half of Hong Kong's [[Legislative Council (Hong Kong)|Legislative Council]] is made up of independents, or members whose political groups are represented by one sole member in the legislature. They are common in [[Functional constituency (Hong Kong)|functional constituencies]], and are not rare among [[geographical constituencies]].\n\n==Croatia==\nAfter an inconclusive election in [[2015 Croatian parliamentary election|2015]], [[Tihomir Ore\u0161kovi\u0107 (politician)|Tihomir Ore\u0161kovi\u0107]] was named the first non-partisan [[Prime Minister of Croatia]].\n\n==Finland==\nAfter serving six years on his first term as [[President of Finland]] in the [[National Coalition Party]] from 2012 to 2018, [[Sauli Niinist\u00f6]] was elected for his second term in 2018 after running as an independent candidate.\n\n==France==\nIn France, independent politicians are frequently categorised as ''sans \u00e9tiquette'' (\"without label\") in municipal or district elections.\n\nIn the nineteenth-century and first half of the twentieth century, most French national politicians were independents. The first modern French political parties date from the early 1900s (foundation of [[Popular Liberal Action|Action Lib\u00e9rale]] and the [[Radical Socialist Republican Party|Radical-Socialist Republican Party]]). The first legislation on political parties dates from 1911, though it was not until 1928 that parliamentarians were required to select a political party for the parliamentary register (either by formally joining a group, or by loosely working with one as an ''apparent\u00e9'', or associate), and not until after 1945 that structured political parties came to dominate parliamentary work.\n\nOnce elected, independents tended to attach themselves to a parliamentary party. In some cases independen deputies banded together to form a technical group of their own. In 1932, for instance, there were four technical groups created: the left-of-centre [[Independent Left (France)|Independent Left]], with 12 deputies; the centre-right liberal [[Independents of the Left]], with 26 deputies; the right-wing [[Agrarianism|agrarian]] [[Independents of Economic, Social and Peasant Action|Independents for Economic, Social and Peasant Action]], with six deputies; and the far-right [[Monarchism in France|monarchist]] [[Republican Independents|Independent Group]], with 12 deputies - these four technical groups thus accounted for one-tenth of deputies. In addition, the larger parliamentary parties, including the socialist SFIO, centre-left PRRRS, centre-right ARD and conservative FR all included a greater or lesser number of independents who sat with their group for parliamentary work (''apparent\u00e9s'').\n\nIn 1920, [[Alexandre Millerand]] was elected [[President of France|president of the Republic]] under the banner \"without label\".\n\nHowever, it is nowadays rare to have independent politicians at national level, if only because independents usually affiliate themselves to an existing political grouping. Noteworthy independents include [[Jos\u00e9 Bov\u00e9]] in the 2007 presidential election. [[Emmanuel Macron]] was an independent politician as Minister, but formed his own party to stand in the 2016 presidential election.\n\nFrom 2001 to 2008 \"without label\" was no longer used in the nomenclature of the [[Minister of the Interior (France)|Ministry of the Interior]]. Candidates and lists presenting themselves as \"without label\" are classified in DVG (various left), DVD (various right), DVC (various center) or AUT (other) according to their political sensitivity. Therefore, from 2008 onwards, the DIV (miscellaneous) or the LDIV code for the \"miscellaneous\" list has been created to group unclassifiable or categorical interests and, by default, mayors without a declared label claiming no political sensitivity, be it left, center or right. The AUT (other) grade replaces the DIV grade without changing its definition.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.senat.fr/basile/visio.do?id=qSEQ080103109|title=Site du s\u00e9nat|website=senat.fr|access-date=2017-02-25|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190323092412/http://www.senat.fr/basile/visio.do?id=qSEQ080103109|archive-date=2019-03-23|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n==Georgia==\n[[Salome Zourabichvili]] won the [[2018 Georgian presidential election]] as an independent candidate, becoming the first-ever female [[President of Georgia]].\n\n==Germany==\n[[Joachim Gauck]], [[President of Germany]] from March 2012 to March 2017 and the first Federal President without party affiliation, was to date the most prominent independent politician. In the [[2010 German presidential election|German presidential election of 2010]] he was the candidate of the  [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|Social Democrats]] and [[Alliance '90/The Greens|Greens]], in [[2012 German presidential election|2012]] the candidate of all major parties except [[The Left (Germany)|The Left]]. His presidency\u2014though his powers are limited\u2014constitutes an exception, as Independent politicians have rarely held high office in German history, at least not since [[World War II]]. It has nevertheless happened that a presidential candidate without any chances of election by the [[Federal Convention (Germany)|Federal Convention]] was not a party member: for example, when in 1984 the Greens came up with the writer [[Luise Rinser]].\n\nIn the [[Bundestag]] parliament nearly all deputies belong to a political party. The voting system of [[mixed-member proportional representation|personalized proportional representation]] (since 1949) allows any individual holding the [[suffrage|passive right to vote]] to stand for a direct [[Mandate (politics)|mandate]] in the [[electoral districts]]\u2014299 of the seats in parliament are distributed by districts according to a [[plurality voting system]]. Such a candidate has to present 200 signatures in favor of his candidacy, the same as a candidate of a party that had no parliamentary presentation previously. The first [[1949 West German federal election|Bundestag election in 1949]] saw three independents elected; since then, no party-independent candidate has won a seat.<ref>[http://www.wahlrecht.de/lexikon/parteilose.html Unabh\u00e4ngige Direktkandidaten] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190409045602/http://www.wahlrecht.de/lexikon/parteilose.html |date=2019-04-09 }}, last seen October 13th, 2012.</ref> At [[States of Germany|state]] level, the situation is more or less the same: only party members have a real chance to be elected to a [[Landtag]] legislature, and state ministers without party membership are just as rare as at the federal level. However, in [[local election]]s it may occur that an independent politician is elected deputy to [[Districts of Germany|districts]]', cities' and municipalities' assemblies, as well as member of a [[city council]] or even [[mayor]], especially in [[Northern Germany]]. In recent years, independents have formed [[Free Voters]] associations to enter Landtag parliaments, so far only successful in [[Landtag of Bavaria|Bavaria]].\n\nAn independent member of parliament, who also is not a member of a voters' association, holds the status of a ''[[non-inscrit]]'' ({{lang-de|fraktionsloser Abgeordneter}}) not affiliated to any [[parliamentary group]]. A representative who leaves his party (and his parliamentary group) and does not join another becomes an independent and ''non-inscrit''. In 1989 the Bundestag MP [[Thomas W\u00fcppesahl]], who had left the Green Party in 1987 and was excluded from the Green parliamentary group the next year, obtained more rights as a non-inscrit, for example more talking time and representation in a subcommittee, when the [[Federal Constitutional Court of Germany|Federal Constitutional Court]] decided partially in his favor.\n\nAfter the [[Unification of Germany|German unification]] of 1871, the first [[Chancellor of Germany|Reich Chancellors]] ([[head of government|heads of government]]) ''de jure'' served as [[executive officer]]s of the [[German Empire|German Imperial states]] as non-partisans, usually recruited from the traditional bureaucratic, aristocratic and/or military elites. In the fierce political conflicts during the [[Weimar Republic|Weimar]] period after [[World War I]], several chancellors and Reich Ministers also had no party affiliation: these chancellors were [[Wilhelm Cuno]] (1922\u20131923), [[Hans Luther]] (1925\u20131926), the former [[Centre Party (Germany)|Centre]] politician [[Franz von Papen]] (1932), and [[Kurt von Schleicher]] (1932\u20131933). The last two [[Cabinet of Germany|cabinets]] appointed by Reich President [[Paul von Hindenburg]], a non-partisan (though strongly [[Conservatism in Germany|Conservative]]) himself, were regarded as apolitical cabinets of experts with regard to the rise of the [[Nazi Party]]; many of the ministers were not party members.\n\nSince World War II, only two ministers of (West) German cabinets have not been party members, though \"on the ticket\" of the major party in the coalition, the Social Democrats: Education Minister [[Hans Leussink]] (1969\u20131972), and Minister of Economy [[Werner M\u00fcller (politician)|Werner M\u00fcller]] (1998\u20132002). Minister of Justice [[Klaus Kinkel]] only shortly after his appointment joined the [[Free Democratic Party (Germany)|Free Democrats]] in 1991. A special case is the former Federal Minister and Chancellor [[Ludwig Erhard]], whose affiliation with the [[Christian Democratic Union (Germany)|Christian Democratic Union]] (CDU) has not been conclusively established: although he served as Minister of Economics from 1949 to 1963 and as Federal Chancellor from 1963 to 1966, and was even elected CDU [[party chair]]man in 1966, it seems that he never signed a membership form or paid contributions. Researches by ''[[Der Stern]]'' magazine have revealed a record at the CDU party archives created only in 1968, with the faked date of entry of early March 1949.<ref>[http://www.stern.de/politik/deutschland/cdu-altkanzler-ludwig-erhard-war-nie-cdu-mitglied-587764.html Stern: Ludwig Erhard war nie CDU-Mitglied] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131026225840/http://www.stern.de/politik/deutschland/cdu-altkanzler-ludwig-erhard-war-nie-cdu-mitglied-587764.html |date=2013-10-26 }}, April 25th, 2007, last seen August 7th, 2012.</ref>\n\n==Iceland==\nThe [[President of Iceland]] (currently [[Gu\u00f0ni Th. J\u00f3hannesson]]) is independent.\n\n==India==\nIndependent candidate contest elections on the basis of their personal appeal or to promote an ideology different from any party. This is right\n\n==Ireland==\n{{Main|Independent politicians in Ireland}}\nIn Ireland, proportional representation, the comparative looseness of formal parties, and strong local sentiment have meant that independents have formed a significant part of the parliamentary landscape since the [[Irish Free State|foundation of the]] state: in the early elections to [[D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann (Irish Free State)|D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann]] (parliament), independents accounted for [[1922 Irish general election|7% of seats in 1922]], [[1923 Irish general election|8.5% in 1923]], [[June 1927 Irish general election|10.5% in 1927]], and [[1932 Irish general election|9% in 1932]], though with the development of relatively more structured parties their numbers declined thereafter. These were similar proportions to the number of independents elected to other interwar European democracies such as France (see above).\n\nIt was not until the 2010s that independents would see a similar electoral success, with record scores for independents surpassing the previous interwar highs.\n\nAfter the [[2016 Irish general election|Irish general election in 2016]], there were 19 independent [[Teachta\u00ed D\u00e1la|TDs]] (parliamentary deputies) in the [[D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann|D\u00e1il]] (the lower house of the Irish parliament), representing 12% of the total. Two technical groups were formed by independent deputies to coordinate their activities: the [[Independents4Change]], with four deputies, opposed the government, while the [[Independent Alliance (Ireland)|Independent Alliance]] formed part of the minority government's working majority. A number of other individual independents similarly supported the government, and received cabinet positions.\n\nThere are fourteen independent senators in the [[Members of the 25th Seanad|25th]] [[Seanad \u00c9ireann|Seanad]] (the upper house of the Irish parliament), representing 23% of the total. Three of these are elected by the graduates of the [[National University of Ireland]] and two from [[Trinity College Dublin|Dublin University]]. There are also five independent senators who were nominated by the [[Taoiseach]] and four elected by the technical panels.\n\n==Italy==\nThe Prime Ministers [[Carlo Azeglio Ciampi]] (1993\u20131994), [[Lamberto Dini]] (1995\u20131996), [[Giuliano Amato]] (2000\u20132001), [[Mario Monti]] (2011\u20132013) and [[Giuseppe Conte]] (2018\u2013present) were independent when they were in office. Ciampi was also the [[President of the Italian Republic]] between 1999 and 2006. President [[Sergio Mattarella]], despite being a former member of the [[Christian Democracy (Italy)|Christian Democracy]] and of the [[Democratic Party (Italy)|Democratic Party]], was elected President in 2015 as an independent.\n\n==Malaysia==\nIndependents have rarely been elected to the [[Dewan Rakyat]] and state legislative assemblies. In Malaysian elections, many independent candidates lose their election deposit because they had failed to secure at least 12.5% or one-eighth of the total votes cast. Independent [[List of members of the Dewan Negara|Senators]] are quite rare.\n\nIn 2010, a group of independent MPs who were sacked from the [[People's Justice Party]] formed a political block called ''[[:ms:Konsensus Bebas|Konsensus Bebas]]''.<ref>[https://weechookeong.com/2010/06/07/konsensus-bebas-formed/ Formation of KONSENSUS BEBAS] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180419184124/https://weechookeong.com/2010/06/07/konsensus-bebas-formed/ |date=2018-04-19 }} (media statement)</ref> The members were [[Zahrain Mohamed Hashim]] (Bayan Baru), [[Wee Choo Keong]] (Wangsa Maju), [[Zulkifli Noordin]] (Kulim-Bandar Bharu), [[Tan Tee Beng]] (Nibong Tebal) dan [[Mohsin Fadzli Samsuri]] (Bagan Serai). It did not last beyond the 12th General Elections.\n\n{{as of|May 2018}}, three independent MPs were elected in [[Malaysian General Election|GE14]], but later joining [[Pakatan Harapan]] ([[People's Justice Party (Malaysia)|PKR]]), thus causing no representation for independent MP for that time. However, as of June 2018 and December 2018, the number increased to 13 independent Members of Parliament that now currently sit in the [[Dewan Rakyat]] as of December 2018.\n\nAt the same time in December 2018, almost all member from Sabah [[UMNO]] quit the party and became independent politicians.\n\n==Mexico==\n[[Jaime Rodr\u00edguez Calder\u00f3n|Jaime Heliodoro Rodr\u00edguez Calder\u00f3n]] (born in 1957), sometimes referred to by his nickname \"El Bronco\", is a [[Mexico|Mexican]] politician who is the current governor for the northern state of [[Nuevo Le\u00f3n]] and holds no political party affiliation. {{as of|2015|June|7|df=US}} elected Governor for Nuevo Le\u00f3n, making history as the first independent candidate to win in the country.\n\n==New Zealand==\nOriginally, there were no recognised parties in the New Zealand parliament, although loose groupings did exist informally (initially between supporters of central government versus provincial governments, and later between liberals and conservatives). The foundation of formal political parties, starting at the end of the 19th century, considerably diminished the number of unaffiliated politicians, although a smaller number of independent candidates continued to be elected up until the 1940s. Since then, however, there have been relatively few independent politicians in Parliament. No independent candidate has won or held a seat in a general election since [[1943 New Zealand general election|1943]], although two independent candidates have been successful in [[by-election]]s (in all cases after having held the seats in question as partisan candidates up until that point). Other politicians have become independents in the course of a parliamentary term, but not been voted into office as such.\n\nThe last person to be directly elected to Parliament as an independent in New Zealand was [[Winston Peters]], who won the {{By-election link|Tauranga|1993}} in {{NZ electorate link|Tauranga}} electorate as an independent after having previously held it a member of the [[New Zealand National Party|National Party]]. By the time of the [[1993 New Zealand general election|next general election]], he had formed his own party ([[New Zealand First]]), and thus was no longer standing as an independent. Since that time, the only independents in Parliament have been people who quit or were expelled from their original party  but retained their seats without going through a by-election. Some have gone on to found or co-found their own parties, with varying levels of success \u2014 examples include [[Peter Dunne]], [[Taito Phillip Field]], [[Gordon Copeland]], [[Tau Henare]], and [[Alamein Kopu]]. Others have joined parties which were then outside Parliament, such as [[Frank Grover]] and [[Tuariki Delamere]].\n\nThere were two independent MPs in the [[49th New Zealand Parliament]]; [[Chris Carter (politician)|Chris Carter]] and [[Hone Harawira]]. Carter became an independent after his criticisms of the [[New Zealand Labour Party|Labour Party]]'s leadership resulted in his being expelled from the Labour caucus, while Harawira resigned from the [[M\u0101ori Party]] and, after a short period as an independent, also resigned as an MP in order to force the {{By-election link|Te Tai Tokerau|2011}} when he was re-elected as representative of his new political party, [[Mana Party (New Zealand)|Mana]] and retained the seat in the 2011 General Election. There were also two other parties which had only a single MP: [[United Future]] with [[Peter Dunne]] and [[ACT New Zealand|ACT]] with [[David Seymour (New Zealand politician)|David Seymour]]. Neither Dunne nor Seymour was classed as an independent \u2014 Dunne's presence in Parliament was due to personal votes in his home electorate, and Seymour's presence was as the sole elected MP of ACT because of a collapse in their support in the {{NZ election link|2011}}. In the [[50th New Zealand Parliament]] there was one independent MP: [[Brendan Horan]], a former New Zealand First MP who was expelled from his party because of allegations of misappropriation of family assets.\n\nPeter Dunne effectively became an Independent MP for a short period after his United Future political party was deregistered on 25 June 2013 by the Electoral Commission, as the party no longer had the required minimum of 500 members. The party was subsequently re-registered.\n\n==Niue==\nIn [[Niue]], there have been no political parties since 2003, when the [[Niue People's Party]] disbanded, and all politicians are ''de facto'' independents. The government depends on an informal coalition.\n\n==Pakistan==\nPakistan also has independent politicians standing in elections. Pakistan's Parliament has [[2008 Pakistani general election|General Elections, 2008]] elected 30 Members. In the 2011 four candidates won seats in the National Assembly. In the 2013 General Election nine seats were won by independents.\n\n==Philippines==\n[[Noli de Castro]], the Philippines' former [[Vice President of the Philippines|vice president]], [[2001 Philippine general election|ran as senator]] in 2001 with no political party affiliation. He was a guest candidate of the opposition [[Pwersa ng Masang Pilipino|Pwersa ng Masa coalition]] but he never joined their campaign rallies. He won in the senate race with the highest votes (then) in Philippine history. In 2004, he ran [[2004 Philippine presidential election|as vice president]] as a guest candidate of the administration [[Koalisyon ng Katapatan at Karanasan sa Kinabukasan|K-4 coalition]] and won with just under majority of the vote.\n\nStarting in 2001, several [[Senate of the Philippines|senators]] had also resigned from their respective parties to become independents; at the start of the [[15th Congress of the Philippines|15th Congress]], there were more independent senators than any other single political party. However, in contesting elections, all elected independents had been members of either the administration or the opposition coalition, until in the [[2007 Philippine Senate election|2007 Senate election]] when [[Gregorio Honasan]] (a former senator) was elected as an independent while not a being member of any coalition. Honasan was earlier [[1995 Philippine Senate election|elected in 1995]] as an independent candidate and being adopted by the [[Nationalist People's Coalition]]-led coalition to become the first elected independent senator since [[Magnolia Antonino]] in [[1967 Philippine Senate election|1967]], although Antonino was a guest candidate of the [[Liberal Party (Philippines)|Liberal Party]] then.\n\nIn the local level, former priest [[Eddie Panlilio]] was elected as governor of [[Pampanga]] in 2007, defeating two administration candidates. When Panlilio eventually transferred to the Liberal Party in time for the 2010 election, it was ruled that he was beaten in the 2007 election; in 2010, he was defeated.\n\nIn the [[2010 Philippine House of Representatives elections|2010 House of Representatives elections]], seven independents were elected, although all but two joined a political party after the elections.\n\nIn contesting elections, independent candidates are required by law to spend less than candidates nominated by a party.\n\n==Poland==\nThe Polish [[Sejm]] is elected by party-list ordination, which does not allow lone candidates to run, although since 2001 there has been a possibility to create non-partisan ''Voters' Electoral Committee'' (pol. ''KWW'', ''komitet wyborczy wyborc\u00f3w''); they are by almost any means party lists, but no officially registered party is behind them. They can be unregistered parties, e.g. [[Kukiz'15]], or non-partisan movements, although the latter never reached the 5% threshold. National minorities candidates also form Voters' Electoral Committees (like [[German Minority Electoral Committee]], represented in Sejm since 1991), but they do not have to reach the nationwide threshold. However, during a Sejm term many members switch parties or become independents.\n\nTickets such as [[Civic Platform]] during the [[2001 Polish parliamentary election|2001 election]] were formally non-partisan, Civic Platform was widely viewed as a de facto political party, as it is now.\n\nThe situation in the [[Senate of Poland|Senate]] is different, as the voting system allows independents to run as single candidates and some are elected in their own right. In the last parliamentary election ([[2015 Polish parliamentary election|2015]]) four independents won seats in the Senate.\n\nThree [[President of Poland|Presidents]] since 1990 have technically been independents. [[Lech Wa\u0142\u0119sa]] was not an endorsed candidate of any party, but the chairman of the [[Solidarity (Polish trade union)|Solidarity]] and he was elected without full support of this union (Solidarity votes split between him and [[Prime Minister of Poland|Prime Minister]] [[Tadeusz Mazowiecki]]). [[Aleksander Kwa\u015bniewski]] was a leader of the [[Social Democracy of the Republic of Poland]], but formally resigned from the party after he was elected, as did [[Lech Kaczy\u0144ski]], who was the first leader of [[Law and Justice]], [[Bronis\u0142aw Komorowski]] ([[Civic Platform|PO]]) and [[Andrzej Duda]] ([[Law and Justice|PiS]]). The resignation is required because the Constitution says that the president shall hold no other offices nor discharge any public functions.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sejm.gov.pl/prawo/konst/angielski/konse.htm#5 |title=The Constitution of the Republic of Poland |publisher=Sejm |accessdate=31 March 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170216093821/http://sejm.gov.pl/prawo/konst/angielski/konse.htm#5 |archive-date=16 February 2017 |url-status=live }}</ref> The aforementioned presidents often participated in their party's campaigns (e.g. Andrzej Duda in the Law and Justice campaign three months after his resignation from the party).\n\n==Portugal==\n[[Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa]], the current [[president of Portugal]] since 6 March 2016, was elected on 24 January 2016 while being a leading member of the [[Social Democratic Party (Portugal)|Social Democratic Party]], but suspended his [[political affiliation]] on the day of his [[Swearing in|swearing-in]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://observador.pt/2016/04/01/marcelo-rebelo-sousa-suspendeu-militancia-do-psd/|title=Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa suspendeu a milit\u00e2ncia no PSD|last=Valente|first=Liliana|date=2016-04-01|work=Observador|access-date=2019-09-15|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160417025221/http://observador.pt/2016/04/01/marcelo-rebelo-sousa-suspendeu-militancia-do-psd/|archive-date=2016-04-17|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n==Russia==\nAll of Russia's [[President of Russia|Presidents]] have been independents. Former president [[Dmitry Medvedev]] declined an offer to join [[United Russia]], saying that he believes the President should be an independent so that he serves the interests of the country rather than his political party.\n\n[[Vladimir Putin]], the current president of Russia, was the head of the [[United Russia]] party until 26 May 2012, but even then was not its member, thus formally was and still is independent.\n\n==Sweden==\nThe Swedish election system is based on parties nominating candidate MPs for their party ballots, and each party has to receive 4% or more of the national vote (or 12% in one region, which has never happened). This makes running as an independent MP impossible. Once elected, the seat is personal; MPs may resign their party membership, or be stripped of it, while retaining their Riksdag seats to become independent to become what is commonly referred to as a ''politisk vilde'' (''political savage'').\n\nIn the executive branch, there is no requirement for ministers to be MPs, or even have a political affiliation (though this has overwhelmingly been the case in modern times). This means that even the prime minister could technically be an independent if chosen by the Riksdag.\n\n==Taiwan==\nAfter the [[2018 Taiwanese local elections]], there is only one independent local head:\n* [[Ko Wen-je]], Mayor of [[Taipei]].\nIn 2019, Ko Wen-je founded the [[Taiwan People's Party]], so there is no independent local head at the moment.\n\n==United Kingdom==\n\nThe [[Registration of Political Parties Act 1998]] laid down the first specific rules in the United Kingdom relating to the use of the term 'independent' by election candidates. That Act was repealed with most of its contents covered by Part II of the [[Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Act 2000]]. Candidates standing for United Kingdom local elections and United Kingdom parliamentary elections, including the devolved assemblies, can use the name of a registered political party, or the term 'Independent' (or its Welsh language equivalent ''annibynol'') or no ballot paper description at all<ref>{{cite web|title=Introduction to standing as a candidate|url=http://www.electoralcommission.org.uk/__data/assets/pdf_file/0003/164109/intro-candidate.pdf|publisher=Electoral Commission|accessdate=10 November 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170202014634/http://www.electoralcommission.org.uk/__data/assets/pdf_file/0003/164109/intro-candidate.pdf|archive-date=2 February 2017|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Electoral Administration Bill|url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmbills/050/en/06050x-c.htm|website=United Kingdom parliament|publisher=United Kingdom parliament|accessdate=10 November 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161110235148/http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmbills/050/en/06050x-c.htm|archive-date=10 November 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> (this latter choice was used, for example, by David Icke at the [[2008 Haltemprice and Howden by-election]]).\n\nSome groups in the United Kingdom who are not affiliated to any national or regional party have registered locality-based political parties.

He was the first independent to be newly elected to the Commons since 1951.<ref name=\"GuardianMartinBell\">[[Martin Bell]]'s 1997 election was the first election of an Independent in the UK since 1951: {{cite news | url=https://www.theguardian.com/global/2007/jun/03/martinbell | title=Martin Bell Profile | publisher=Guardian | accessdate=October 18, 2012 | location=London | date=3 June 2008 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151017203222/http://www.theguardian.com/global/2007/jun/03/martinbell | archive-date=17 October 2015 | url-status=live }}</ref> He stood unsuccessfully in a different constituency in 2001.\n\nAt the [[2001 United Kingdom general election|2001 General Election]], [[Richard Taylor (UK politician)|Dr Richard Taylor]] of the [[Independent Kidderminster Hospital and Health Concern]] party was elected for the constituency of [[Wyre Forest (UK Parliament constituency)|Wyre Forest]]. Taylor was re-elected for Wyre Forest at the [[2005 United Kingdom general election|2005 General Election]], becoming the only independent in recent times to have been elected for a second term.\n\nTwo independent (or local party) members of parliament were elected in the [[2005 United Kingdom general election|2005 election]], although both were defeated five years later. In the same election, [[Peter Law]] was elected as an independent at [[Blaenau Gwent (UK Parliament constituency)|Blaenau Gwent]]. Law died on 25 April 2006: the resulting [[2006 Blaenau Gwent by-elections|by-election]] elected [[Dai Davies (politician)|Dai Davies]] of the local party [[Blaenau Gwent People's Voice]]. The by-election was unusual as it was the first time in over eighty years that an independent had held a seat previously occupied by another independent.\n\nOnly one independent was elected to the Commons in the [[2010 United Kingdom general election|2010]], [[2015 United Kingdom general election|2015]] and [[2017 United Kingdom general election|2017 elections]]: [[Sylvia Hermon]], the member for [[North Down (UK Parliament constituency)|North Down]], a [[Unionism in Ireland|Unionist]] who left the [[Ulster Unionist Party]] because of its links with the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservatives]].\n\nThere have also been several instances of politicians being elected to the Commons as representatives of a political party, then resigning the party's whip, or having it withdrawn. Examples in this in the 2010-2015 parliament included [[Mike Hancock (British politician)|Mike Hancock]] (formerly a Liberal Democrat), [[Eric Joyce]] (formerly Labour) and [[Nadine Dorries]], a Conservative who had the whip withdrawn for part of the parliament and thus sat as an independent during that time.\n\nIndependent candidates often stand in British parliamentary elections, often with platforms about specific local issues, but usually without  success. An example from the [[2001 United Kingdom general election|2001 general election]] was [[Aston Villa]] supporter Ian Robinson, who stood as an independent in the [[Sutton Coldfield (UK Parliament constituency)|Sutton Coldfield constituency]] in protest at the way chairman [[Doug Ellis]] ran the football club. Another example an independent candidate, in the [[Salisbury (UK Parliament constituency)|Salisbury constituency]], is [[Arthur Uther Pendragon]], a local activist and self-declared reincarnation of [[King Arthur]].\n\nOther independent candidates are associated with a political party and may be former members of it, but cannot stand under its label. For instance, after being expelled from the Labour Party but before the [[RESPECT The Unity Coalition|Respect Coalition]] was founded, British [[Member of parliament|Member of Parliament]] (MP) [[George Galloway]] described himself as \"Independent Labour\".\n\nOn 23 March 2005 the [[Independent Network]] was set up to support independent candidates in the General Election.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.independentnetwork.org.uk/Launch_news_release.html|title=Launchdate of the Independent Network|publisher=}}{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> The Independent Network still supports Independent candidates in local, regional, national and European elections.

The Independent Network does not impose any [[ideology]] or political influence on their candidates.\n\nIn March 2009, the multi-millionaire [[Paul Judge]] established the [[Jury Team]], an umbrella organisation dedicated to increasing the number of independent candidates standing in Britain, in both national and European elections.<ref name=Independant8Mar09>{{cite news | last = Gourlay | first = Chris | title = Tycoon finances 'X Factor' party to clean up politics | publisher = [[The Sunday Times]] | date = 2009-03-08 | url = http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/politics/article5864530.ece | accessdate = 2009-05-10 | location = London | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20090316004542/http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/politics/article5864530.ece | archive-date = 2009-03-16 | url-status = live }}</ref>\n\n====Independent and undescribed candidates====\n\nPart II of the [[Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Act 2000]] allows individuals who wish to stand as a candidate to all parliaments and assemblies in the UK, including the House of Commons, the right to use one of three ballot paper descriptions.

The first [[Mayor of London]], [[Ken Livingstone]], was [[2000 London mayoral election|first elected]] as an independent, having run against the official Labour candidate [[Frank Dobson]]. He was subsequently re-admitted to the Labour Party in December 2003 before his first re-election campaign.\n\nIndependent candidates frequently stand and are elected to local councils. There is a special Independent group of the [[Local Government Association]] to cater for them. A number of local authorities have been entirely or almost entirely composed of independent members, such as the [[City of London Corporation]], the [[2009 Council of the Isles of Scilly election|Isles of Scilly Council]], [[Orkney Islands Council]], [[Shetland Islands Council]] and [[Comhairle nan Eilean Siar]] (Western Isles Council) in the [[Outer Hebrides]].\n\nRoughly a quarter of the [[police and crime commissioner]]s elected in England and Wales in the [[2012 England and Wales police and crime commissioner elections|2012 election]] were independents.<ref name=PCCs_uk>{{cite news|title=Q&A: Police and crime commissioners|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-19504639|accessdate=27 November 2014|work=BBC News|date=12 November 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141015112020/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-19504639|archive-date=15 October 2014|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n==United States==\n{{see also|Third party officeholders in the United States}}\n\n===President===\n[[George Washington]] was the only [[President of the United States|President]] elected as an independent.

This strategy has been pursued by several other candidates for federal races, including [[Joe Lieberman]] ([[Connecticut for Lieberman]]).\n\n===Governor===\n[[Illinois]], [[Maine]], [[Oregon]], [[Rhode Island]], [[Texas]], [[Alaska]] and [[Minnesota]] have elected formally independent candidates as governor: Illinois's first two governors, [[Shadrach Bond]] and [[Edward Coles]]; [[James B.

[[Lowell P. Weicker Jr.]] is sometimes mentioned as an independent governor, though this is not technically correct; he ran as an [[A Connecticut Party]] candidate (which gave him better ballot placement than an unaffiliated candidate would receive), defeating the Democratic and Republican party nominees.  Another former governor who is sometimes mentioned as an independent is [[Jesse Ventura]], who actually ran as a member of the [[Reform Party of the United States of America|Reform Party's]] Minnesota affiliate, which later disaffiliated from the party and reverted to their original name the [[Independence Party of Minnesota]].\n\nIn 1971, State Senator [[Henry Howell]] of [[Virginia]], a former Democrat, was elected [[Lieutenant Governor of Virginia|lieutenant governor]] as an independent. Two years later, he campaigned for [[Governor of Virginia|governor]] as an independent, but lost by 15,000 votes.\n\nThere were several unsuccessful independent gubernatorial candidates in 2006 who impacted their electoral races. In [[Maine]], state legislator [[Barbara Merrill]] (formerly a Democrat) received 21% of the vote. In [[Texas]], [[country music]] singer and [[detective fiction|mystery novelist]] [[Kinky Friedman]] received 12.43% of the vote, and State [[Comptroller]] [[Carole Keeton Strayhorn]] received 18.13%. Strayhorn and Friedman's presence in the race resulted in a splitting of the ballot four ways between themselves and the two major parties.\n\nIn 2010, [[Florida]] [[Governor of Florida|governor]] [[Charlie Crist]] left the Republican party and became Independent (He later became a Democrat.)<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/10/27/charlie-crist-senate-race_n_774589.html|work=Huffington Post|title=Charlie Crist Comes Under Fire For Pulling Party Switch|date=27 October 2010|access-date=26 December 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305231220/http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/10/27/charlie-crist-senate-race_n_774589.html|archive-date=5 March 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> rather than face former [[Florida House of Representatives|state house]] [[Speaker of the Florida House of Representatives|Speaker]] [[Marco Rubio]] in the Republican primary (Rubio won, though Crist came in ahead of Democratic nominee [[Kendrick Meek]]).\n\nIn 2014, former [[Honolulu]] mayor [[Mufi Hannemann]] ran as an independent candidate for the [[Governor of Hawaii|governorship]] of the State of [[Hawaii]] after previously campaigning in the state's Democratic primary.

Notable examples include [[David Davis (Supreme Court justice)|David Davis]] of [[Illinois]] (a former [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]]) in the 19th century, and [[Harry F. Byrd Jr.]] of [[Virginia]] (who had been elected to his first term as a Democrat) in the 20th century.  Some officials have been elected as members of a party but became independent while in office (without being elected as such), such as [[Wayne Morse]] of [[Oregon]]. [[Nebraska]] senator [[George W. Norris]] was elected for four terms as a Republican before changing to an independent after the Republicans lost their majority in Congress in 1930. Norris won re-election as an independent in 1936, but later lost his final re-election attempt to Republican [[Kenneth S. Wherry]] in 1942. [[Vermont]] senator [[Jim Jeffords]] left the Republican Party to become an independent in 2001. Jeffords's [[party switching|change of party status]] was especially significant because it shifted the Senate composition from 50-50 between the Republicans and Democrats (with a Republican [[Vice President of the United States|Vice President]], [[Dick Cheney]], who would presumably break all ties in favor of the Republicans), to 49 Republicans, 50 Democrats, and one Independent. Jeffords agreed to vote for Democratic control of the Senate in exchange for being appointed chairman of the [[U.S. Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works|Senate Environment and Public Works Committee]], and the Democrats held control of the Senate until the [[2002 U.S. Senate election|Congressional elections in 2002]], when the Republicans regained their majority. Jeffords retired at the end of his term in 2007. Wayne Morse after two years as an independent became a Democrat. [[Dean Barkley]] of the [[Independence Party of Minnesota]] was appointed a day before the 2002 elections to fill the senate seat of [[Paul Wellstone]] who, while running for re-election, died weeks prior. Barkley refused to caucus with either party.\n\nSenator Bernie Sanders is the longest-serving independent member of Congress in American history.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://news.yahoo.com/bernie-sanders-president-democrat-145640890.html |title=Vermont Independent Sen.

Sanders later won the open Senate seat of [[Jim Jeffords]] as an independent. [[Joe Lieberman]] is a former [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] who, like [[Lowell P. Weicker Jr.]], ran under a third party ([[Connecticut for Lieberman|Connecticut for Lieberman Party]]) in the [[2006 Connecticut United States Senate election|2006 election]]. Though both representatives are technically independent politicians, they often caucus with the Democrats. In 2006, Sanders and Lieberman were the only two victorious independent candidates for Congress, both caucusing with the Democrats. In 2012 [[Angus King]] was elected to the US Senate as an Independent from Maine. {{as of|2016}}, he has typically caucused with the Democrats.\n\nThe [[United States House of Representatives]] has also seen a handful of [[Third-party members of the United States House of Representatives|independent members]]. Examples include [[Bernie Sanders]] of [[Vermont]], [[Virgil Goode]] of [[Virginia]], [[Frazier Reams]] of [[Ohio]], [[Victor Berger]] of [[Wisconsin]], and [[Justin Amash]] of [[Michigan]].\n\n===State and local offices===\nIn August 2008, there were 12 independents who held offices in state legislatures. There were four state senators, one from [[Kentucky Senate|Kentucky]], one from [[Oregon Senate|Oregon]], one from [[Tennessee Senate|Tennessee]], and one from [[New Mexico Senate|New Mexico]]. The representatives came from the states of [[Louisiana House of Representatives|Louisiana]] (two), [[Maine House of Representatives|Maine]] (two), [[Vermont House of Representatives|Vermont]] (two), and [[Virginia House of Delegates|Virginia]] (two). In the 2008 general elections, Wisconsin State Assemblyman Jeffrey Wood left the Republican Party and won reelection as an independent. After the 2008 primary election, New Mexico State Senator [[Joseph Carraro]] left the Republican Party and registered as an Independent. He did not run for reelection.\n\nIn November 2005, [[Manny Diaz (Florida politician)|Manny Diaz]] was elected Mayor of [[Miami, Florida]] as an independent.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.citymayors.com/mayors/miami_mayor.html |title=Manny Diaz - Mayor of Miami |publisher=City Mayors |date=2008-01-28 |accessdate=2010-08-29 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101104053525/http://citymayors.com/mayors/miami_mayor.html |archive-date=2010-11-04 |url-status=live }}</ref> On June 19, 2007, [[Mayor of New York City|New York Mayor]] [[Michael Bloomberg]] switched his party affiliation from Republican to independent.

In the Legislature (which is additionally unique in that it is also the only state legislature that is [[unicameral]]), there are no formal party alignments or groups and the members are nominated in nonpartisan primary elections.

Titus-Adams was critical about the lack of material given to her, accusing the BBC of [[tokenism]]. Nina arrives in [[Walford]] looking for a fresh start away from her past as a prostitute.

She arrives in Walford as it was the last place Saskia was seen, and her disappearance is being investigated by the police. Claudia is suspicious of [[Steve Owen (EastEnders)|Steve Owen]] ([[Martin Kemp (entertainer)|Martin Kemp]]), her sister's former fianc\u00e9 (and killer), but then becomes dependent on him, alternating between the two and irritating Steve. [[Matthew Rose (EastEnders)|Matthew Rose]] ([[Joe Absolom]]), who witnessed Saskia's death, is worried that Claudia will discover that her sister is dead. She eventually returns home after Saskia's body is found buried in [[Epping Forest]]. Claudia testifies at Steve's trial and is devastated when he is cleared of Saskia's murder, with Matthew found guilty instead.\n\nAfter Matthew wins an appeal against his sentence and returns to Walford to get his revenge on Steve, he claims to have murdered Claudia and planted evidence to frame Steve.

Natalie and Susie do not get along. Their mother, [[Andrea Price|Andrea]] ([[Cindy O'Callaghan]]), had always favoured Susie, and the two of them like nothing better than to pick holes in Natalie. Susie is angry with Natalie because she has been absent for several years and she constantly jibes Natalie about her appearance and how unattractive Barry is.

Jackie's husband, Doug (a hotelier and club owner), was sent to prison for manslaughter after accidentally killing a violent punter. Whilst there, he committed suicide, so Jackie is determined that her brother will not share the same fate.\n\nJackie believes her brother is innocent, but aware of the hostility towards him in the Square, she initially refrains from revealing her connection to him. She takes a job as a waitress at Giuseppe's Italian restaurant, owned by the di Marco family. In between shifts, Jackie starts questioning the residents of Walford about Steve, hoping to find something that will exonerate him. When [[Gianni di Marco]] ([[Marc Bannerman]]) discovers a prison visiting order in Jackie's belongings, he reveals her true identity, infuriating the locals. During Steve's trial, Jackie realises that Steve is lying about murdering Saskia. She is furious but still gives tearful and moving testimony that undoubtedly sways the jury in Steve's favour and probably buys his freedom. Steve is found not guilty, whilst [[Matthew Rose (EastEnders)|Matthew Rose]] ([[Joe Absolom]]), whom Steve has framed, is found guilty of manslaughter and is sent to prison for a crime he didn't commit.\n\nJackie and Steve are the targets of regular animosity on the Square, regarding Steve's actions. [[Martin Fowler (EastEnders)|Martin Fowler]] ([[James Alexandrou]]) in particular, has it in for Jackie, and after goading her in the restaurant one day, Jackie finally loses it and fiercely orders him to leave. Martin proceeds to steal a customer's money from a nearby table and then does a runner. Jackie and Gianni follow him into a half-demolished building and as Martin looks back from outside, he hears Jackie shriek as a huge piece of piping falls towards her. Jackie is trapped but awake and Gianni lays half-conscious beside her.<ref>{{cite web|work=Daily Record|date= 23 October 1999|url= http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Soap+watch%3b+More+disasters+on+EastEnders'+horizon.-a060362961/|title=More disasters on EastEnders' horizon.|accessdate= 2 April 2010}}</ref> Whilst they wait to be rescued, they begin sharing life stories and begin to bond. The firemen have difficulty moving the debris as any wrong move could bring the whole roof down. Amidst all the chaos, Jackie and Gianni manage to kill time by flirting and just as the two lean in to kiss, the roof collapses. Steve rushes into the building to save them and neither is badly injured.\n\nOver the following months, Jackie gets involved with the free Matthew Rose campaign, possibly to relieve her guilt for her part in his imprisonment. She and Gianni begin a relationship and it seems as if the womanising Italian is really falling for Jackie. However, Jackie isn't the easiest woman to please. She has a quick temper and a jealous streak and as time goes by, these tendencies became more and more apparent. Jackie begins taking everything Gianni says the wrong way, resulting in screaming matches for seemingly no reason. After Jackie manages to scald Gianni by tipping hot coffee over him in a fit of rage, she finally explains she suffers with severe [[Premenstrual stress syndrome|Premenstrual Tension]] (PMS) for a week every month which makes her enraged and violent. Gianni is uncharacteristically sympathetic and he tries making allowances for Jackie's behaviour. Later, after injuring Gianni by punching him in the face and smashing up the restaurant, Jackie seeks medical help. She is given medication and hopes that this will solve her problem but it doesn't. After hitting Gianni with a saucepan one night, Jackie decides to end the relationship as she cannot stand the thought of harming him. Gianni is stunned, as he has fallen deeply in love with her. Gianni makes one last attempt to save their relationship, but when his mother, [[Rosa di Marco|Rosa]] ([[Louise Jameson]]), discovers the abuse Jackie has put him through, she forbids Jackie from having anything more to do with him.\n\nJackie leaves Walford after learning of her brother's drug habit in June 2000. Steve returns from rehab alone. When their mother, [[Barbara Owen|Barbara]] ([[Sheila Hancock]]), falls ill a year later, she relays that Jackie has refused to help her and it is subsequently revealed that they hate each other. Jackie refuses to attend her funeral in 2001 and doesn't attend Steve's funeral in 2002 either. In April 2002, Steve's widow, [[Mel Owen]] ([[Tamzin Outhwaite]]), discovers she and Jackie are being investigated by the police for money laundering and drug trafficking. Steve was actually guilty of these crimes but had set them up as company directors of his illegitimate businesses, and following his death, they are held accountable.\n{{Clear}}\n\n== Troy Harvey==\n{{Infobox soap character\n|series = EastEnders\n|image=\n|name=Troy Harvey\n|portrayer=[[Jamie Jarvis]]\n|first=Episode 1837 <br/> 20 September 1999\n|last=Episode 1883 <br/> 25 December 1999\n|classification=[[List of past EastEnders characters#Last appeared in 1999|Former; recurring]]\n|brothers = Wilf Harvey\n}}\n'''Troy Harvey''', played by Jamie Jarvis, is a friend of [[Tony Hills]] ([[Mark Homer]]), who had attended school with his older brother.

The affair ends on Christmas Day 1999 when Terry discovers an engraved watch given to Troy by Irene and begins to realise his wife is cheating on him. After punching Troy, Terry offers Irene to him, stating that he loves her enough to give her up if that is what she wants.

Claudia is suspicious of [[Steve Owen (EastEnders)|Steve Owen]] ([[Martin Kemp (entertainer)|Martin Kemp]]), her sister's former fianc\u00e9 (and killer), but then becomes dependent on him, alternating between the two and irritating Steve. [[Matthew Rose (EastEnders)|Matthew Rose]] ([[Joe Absolom]]), who witnessed Saskia's death, is worried that Claudia will discover that her sister is dead. She eventually returns home after Saskia's body is found buried in [[Epping Forest]]. Claudia testifies at Steve's trial and is devastated when he is cleared of Saskia's murder, with Matthew found guilty instead.\n\nAfter Matthew wins an appeal against his sentence and returns to Walford to get his revenge on Steve, he claims to have murdered Claudia and planted evidence to frame Steve.

Natalie and Susie do not get along. Their mother, [[Andrea Price|Andrea]] ([[Cindy O'Callaghan]]), had always favoured Susie, and the two of them like nothing better than to pick holes in Natalie. Susie is angry with Natalie because she has been absent for several years and she constantly jibes Natalie about her appearance and how unattractive Barry is.

Jackie's husband, Doug (a hotelier and club owner), was sent to prison for manslaughter after accidentally killing a violent punter. Whilst there, he committed suicide, so Jackie is determined that her brother will not share the same fate.\n\nJackie believes her brother is innocent, but aware of the hostility towards him in the Square, she initially refrains from revealing her connection to him. She takes a job as a waitress at Giuseppe's Italian restaurant, owned by the di Marco family. In between shifts, Jackie starts questioning the residents of Walford about Steve, hoping to find something that will exonerate him. When [[Gianni di Marco]] ([[Marc Bannerman]]) discovers a prison visiting order in Jackie's belongings, he reveals her true identity, infuriating the locals. During Steve's trial, Jackie realises that Steve is lying about murdering Saskia. She is furious but still gives tearful and moving testimony that undoubtedly sways the jury in Steve's favour and probably buys his freedom. Steve is found not guilty, whilst [[Matthew Rose (EastEnders)|Matthew Rose]] ([[Joe Absolom]]), whom Steve has framed, is found guilty of manslaughter and is sent to prison for a crime he didn't commit.\n\nJackie and Steve are the targets of regular animosity on the Square, regarding Steve's actions. [[Martin Fowler (EastEnders)|Martin Fowler]] ([[James Alexandrou]]) in particular, has it in for Jackie, and after goading her in the restaurant one day, Jackie finally loses it and fiercely orders him to leave. Martin proceeds to steal a customer's money from a nearby table and then does a runner. Jackie and Gianni follow him into a half-demolished building and as Martin looks back from outside, he hears Jackie shriek as a huge piece of piping falls towards her. Jackie is trapped but awake and Gianni lays half-conscious beside her.<ref>{{cite web|work=Daily Record|date= 23 October 1999|url= http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Soap+watch%3b+More+disasters+on+EastEnders'+horizon.-a060362961/|title=More disasters on EastEnders' horizon.|accessdate= 2 April 2010}}</ref> Whilst they wait to be rescued, they begin sharing life stories and begin to bond. The firemen have difficulty moving the debris as any wrong move could bring the whole roof down. Amidst all the chaos, Jackie and Gianni manage to kill time by flirting and just as the two lean in to kiss, the roof collapses. Steve rushes into the building to save them and neither is badly injured.\n\nOver the following months, Jackie gets involved with the free Matthew Rose campaign, possibly to relieve her guilt for her part in his imprisonment. She and Gianni begin a relationship and it seems as if the womanising Italian is really falling for Jackie. However, Jackie isn't the easiest woman to please. She has a quick temper and a jealous streak and as time goes by, these tendencies became more and more apparent. Jackie begins taking everything Gianni says the wrong way, resulting in screaming matches for seemingly no reason. After Jackie manages to scald Gianni by tipping hot coffee over him in a fit of rage, she finally explains she suffers with severe [[Premenstrual stress syndrome|Premenstrual Tension]] (PMS) for a week every month which makes her enraged and violent. Gianni is uncharacteristically sympathetic and he tries making allowances for Jackie's behaviour. Later, after injuring Gianni by punching him in the face and smashing up the restaurant, Jackie seeks medical help. She is given medication and hopes that this will solve her problem but it doesn't. After hitting Gianni with a saucepan one night, Jackie decides to end the relationship as she cannot stand the thought of harming him. Gianni is stunned, as he has fallen deeply in love with her. Gianni makes one last attempt to save their relationship, but when his mother, [[Rosa di Marco|Rosa]] ([[Louise Jameson]]), discovers the abuse Jackie has put him through, she forbids Jackie from having anything more to do with him.\n\nJackie leaves Walford after learning of her brother's drug habit in June 2000. Steve returns from rehab alone. When their mother, [[Barbara Owen|Barbara]] ([[Sheila Hancock]]), falls ill a year later, she relays that Jackie has refused to help her and it is subsequently revealed that they hate each other. Jackie refuses to attend her funeral in 2001 and doesn't attend Steve's funeral in 2002 either. In April 2002, Steve's widow, [[Mel Owen]] ([[Tamzin Outhwaite]]), discovers she and Jackie are being investigated by the police for money laundering and drug trafficking. Steve was actually guilty of these crimes but had set them up as company directors of his illegitimate businesses, and following his death, they are held accountable.\n{{Clear}}\n\n== Troy Harvey==\n{{Infobox soap character\n|series = EastEnders\n|image=\n|name=Troy Harvey\n|portrayer=[[Jamie Jarvis]]\n|first=Episode 1837 <br/> 20 September 1999\n|last=Episode 1883 <br/> 25 December 1999\n|classification=[[List of past EastEnders characters#Last appeared in 1999|Former; recurring]]\n|brothers = Wilf Harvey\n}}\n'''Troy Harvey''', played by Jamie Jarvis, is a friend of [[Tony Hills]] ([[Mark Homer]]), who had attended school with his older brother.

It becomes apparent that Troy is attracted to Irene and begins flirting with her. Soon the two of them begin an illicit affair, behind Terry's back. The affair ends on Christmas Day 1999 when Terry discovers an engraved watch given to Troy by Irene and begins to realise his wife is cheating on him. After punching Troy, Terry offers Irene to him, stating that he loves her enough to give her up if that is what she wants.

However, he also receives a lot of unwanted attention from Sonia's friend, [[Nicky di Marco]] ([[Carly Hillman]]), which causes several arguments.\n\nSonia is sure that Enrico prefers Nicky and so she shuns him when he asks her on a date. Nicky eventually grows tired of Enrico constantly talking about Sonia, so she tells him to tell her how he feels. He does, and Sonia is overjoyed. However their romance is short-lived, as Enrico returns home to Italy the following day, but not before he takes her for a romantic meal and a dance at Giuseppe's Italian restaurant.

The ride creates the impression that the rider is turning upside down, whereas it is actually the room that is moving around them.\n\nThe ride is a modern implementation of a [[haunted swing]] illusion.\n\n==Ride experience==\nMadhouses are often extensively themed during the ride sequence, and usually in the [[Queue area|queue line]]. Several Madhouses feature pre-shows explaining a story behind the ride. Once in the ride, lapbars are lowered onto the riders, before they gradually experience an odd sense of [[:wikt:movement|movement]]. This is achieved through two mechanisms - the separate floor can move in a controlled swing from side-to-side by up to 15/30 degrees in each direction, but the surroundings of the room can rotate through a full 360 degrees. The [[Rotation|pivot]] mechanism for the floor is hidden by two large objects at the end of the room, which are themed to match the ride.\n\nAt this point, both the floor and the room are slowly moving in unison. As the ride continues, the floor starts a separate movement from the rotating drum which gradually gives the impression that the room is rotating backwards and forwards further each time. Vekoma offers theme parks the option of programming their own sequence of how the room and floor move. In many Madhouses, the [[lighting]] subtly changes from moment to moment to add to the [[disorientation]].

The ride creates the impression that the rider is turning upside down, whereas it is actually the room that is moving around them.\n\nThe ride is a modern implementation of a [[haunted swing]] illusion.\n\n==Ride experience==\nMadhouses are often extensively themed during the ride sequence, and usually in the [[Queue area|queue line]]. Several Madhouses feature pre-shows explaining a story behind the ride. Once in the ride, lapbars are lowered onto the riders, before they gradually experience an odd sense of [[:wikt:movement|movement]]. This is achieved through two mechanisms - the separate floor can move in a controlled swing from side-to-side by up to 15/30 degrees in each direction, but the surroundings of the room can rotate through a full 360 degrees. The [[Rotation|pivot]] mechanism for the floor is hidden by two large objects at the end of the room, which are themed to match the ride.\n\nAt this point, both the floor and the room are slowly moving in unison. As the ride continues, the floor starts a separate movement from the rotating drum which gradually gives the impression that the room is rotating backwards and forwards further each time. Vekoma offers theme parks the option of programming their own sequence of how the room and floor move. In many Madhouses, the [[lighting]] subtly changes from moment to moment to add to the [[disorientation]]. Eventually, the drum mechanism turns through a full rotation and, by careful [[synchronisation]] with the sensation of the swinging floor mechanism, the riders are fooled into feeling as if they themselves are being repeatedly turned upside down.<ref name=\"vekoma\"/><ref>{{cite web|title=''Revolving House'' by Mack Rides|url=http://www.mack-rides.com/en/products/dark-rides/revolving-house/dr-rh-info/dr-rh-info.html|website=mack-rides.com|accessdate=2014-11-17 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141017135818/http://www.mack-rides.com/en/products/dark-rides/revolving-house/dr-rh-info/index.html |archivedate=2014-10-17 |url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Video of the mechanism|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SppOrEx8DvA|website=youtube.com|accessdate=2014-11-17}}</ref>\n\n== List of Madhouses ==\n[[File:Villa Volta Efteling 2018.jpg|thumb|Interior of [[Villa Volta]], the first modern madhouse.]]\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\" \n!
