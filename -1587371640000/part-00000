This initial settlement place on the Swan River was soon named [[Perth#History|Perth]], and it became the capital city of Western Australia.\n\nThe name was a ''[[pars pro toto]]'' for Western Australia. In 1832 the colony was renamed the [[Colony of Western Australia]], when the colony's founding [[Governor of Western Australia|lieutenant-governor]], Captain [[James Stirling (Australian governor)|James Stirling]], belatedly received his commission. However, the name \"Swan River Colony\" remained in informal use for many years afterwards.\n\n==European exploration==\n[[File:Vlamingh ships at the Swan River, Keulen 1796.jpg|thumb|left|''[[Willem de Vlamingh]]'s ships, with [[black swan]]s, at the entrance to the Swan River, Western Australia'', coloured engraving (1796), derived from an earlier drawing (now lost) from the de Vlamingh expeditions of 1696\u201397]]\nThe first recorded Europeans to sight land where the city of [[Perth, Western Australia|Perth]] is now located were [[Dutch people|Dutch]] sailors. Most likely the first visitor to the [[Swan River (Western Australia)|Swan River]] area was [[Frederick de Houtman]] on 19 July 1619, travelling on the ships ''Dordrecht'' and ''Amsterdam''. His records indicate he first reached the Western Australian coast at [[latitude]] 32\u00b020' which would equate to [[Rottnest]] or just south of there.

Of the 193 on board, only 75 made it to shore. A small boat that survived the wreckage then sailed to Batavia for help, but a subsequent search party found none of the survivors.

''Waekende Boey'' under Captain S. Volckertszoon, ''Elburg'' under Captain J. Peereboom and ''Emeloort'' under Captain A. Joncke sighted [[Rottnest]] but did not proceed any closer to the mainland because of the many reefs. They then travelled north and subsequently found the wreck of ''Vergulde Draeck'' (but still no survivors). They gave an unfavourable opinion of the area partly due to the dangerous reefs.<ref name=\"Appleyard & Manford 1979\" />\n\n[[Image:Battye freycinet swanriver lg.jpg|thumb|right|The first detailed map of the Swan River, drawn by the French in 1801]]\n\nThe Dutch captain [[Willem de Vlamingh]] was the next European in the area. Commanding three ships, ''Geelvink'', ''Nyptangh'' and ''Wezeltje'', he arrived at and named Rottnest on 29 December 1696, and on 10 January 1697 visited and named the Swan River. His ships could not sail up the river because of a sand bar at its mouth, so he sent out a [[sloop]] which even then required some dragging over the sand bar. They sailed until reaching mud flats probably near [[Heirisson Island]]. They saw some [[Australian aborigine|Aborigines]] but were not able to meet any close up. Vlamingh was also not impressed with the area, and this was probably the reason for a lack of Dutch exploration from then on.<ref name=\"Appleyard & Manford 1979\" />\n\nIn 1801, the French ships ''[[French corvette G\u00e9ographe|G\u00e9ographe]]'' captained by [[Nicolas Baudin]] and ''Naturaliste'' captained by [[Jacques F\u00e9lix Emmanuel Hamelin|Emmanuel Hamelin]] visited the area from the south. While ''G\u00e9ographe'' continued northwards, ''Naturaliste'' remained for a few weeks. A small expedition dragged longboats over the sand bar and explored the Swan River. They also gave unfavourable descriptions regarding any potential settlement due to many mud flats upstream and the sand bar (the sand bar wasn't removed until the 1890s when [[C. Y. O'Connor]] built Fremantle harbour).\n\nLater in March 1803, ''G\u00e9ographe'' with another ship ''Casuarina'' passed by Rottnest on their way eventually back to France, but did not stop longer than a day or two.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.multicultural.online.wa.gov.au/wppuser/owamc/onlinenews_3_04/page8.html|title=The Baudin Expedition of 1800\u20131804 |first=Kate |last=Pratt |website=Terra Australis 2001 WA Association Inc |access-date=14 February 2009|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090116051501/http://www.multicultural.online.wa.gov.au/wppuser/owamc/onlinenews_3_04/page8.html|archive-date=16 January 2009|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.abc.net.au/navigators/captains/baudin.htm|title=The Captains: Nicholas Baudin |publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation |access-date=14 February 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090104075905/http://www.abc.net.au/navigators/captains/baudin.htm|archive-date=4 January 2009|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nThe next visit to the area was the first Australian-born maritime explorer, [[Phillip Parker King]] in 1822 on ''Bathurst''.

He was accompanied by [[Charles Fraser (botanist)|Charles Fraser]], the [[New South Wales]] botanist.\n\nTheir initial exploration began on 8 March in a cutter and gig with parties continuing on foot from 13 March. In late March, {{HMS|Success|1825|2}} moved to [[Sydney]], arriving there on 15 April. Stirling arrived back in [[England]] in July 1828, promoting in glowing terms the agricultural potential of the area. His lobbying was for the establishment of a \"free\" settlement{{snd}}unlike [[penal colony|penal colonies]] at [[New South Wales]], [[Port Arthur, Tasmania|Port Arthur]] and [[Norfolk Island]]{{snd}}in the Swan River area with himself as its governor . As a result of these reports, and a rumour in [[London]] that the [[France|French]] were about to establish a penal colony in the western part of Australia, possibly at [[Shark Bay]], the Colonial Office assented to the proposal in mid-October 1828.\n\nIn December 1828 a Secretary of State for Colonies despatch reserved land for the Crown, as well as for the clergy, and for education, and specified that water frontage was to be rationed. The most cursory exploration had preceded the British decision to found a settlement at the Swan River; the most makeshift arrangements were to govern its initial establishment and the granting of land; and the most sketchy surveys were to be made before the grants were actually occupied. A set of regulations were worked out for distributing land to settlers on the basis of [[Land grants in the Swan River Colony|land grants]]. Negotiations for a privately run settlement were also started with a consortium of four gentlemen headed by [[Potter McQueen]], a member of Parliament who had already acquired a large tract of land in [[New South Wales]]. The consortium withdrew after the Colonial Office refused to give it preference over independent settlers in selecting land, but one member, [[Thomas Peel]], accepted the terms and proceeded alone. Peel was allocated {{convert|500,000|acres|km2}}, conditional on his arrival at the settlement before 1 November 1829 with 400 settlers. Peel arrived after this date with only 300 settlers, but was still granted {{convert|250,000|acres|km2}}.\n{{Clear}}\n\n==Events of the settlement==\n{| class=wikitable align=right style=\"font-size: 85%; margin-left: 10pt;\"\n! bgcolor=\"#efefef\" colspan=2|Swan River Colony<br/>ship arrivals in 1829<ref>{{cite web|url=http://membership.wags.org.au/1829-ships/78-1829-shipping-arrivals|title=WA 1829 Passenger Ship Arrivals|publisher=Western Australian Genealogical Society|date=4 December 2013|accessdate=23 December 2016}}</ref>\n\n|-\n|25 April || {{HMS|Challenger|1826|6}}<br/>([[Charles Fremantle|Fremantle]])\n|-\n|31 May || ''[[Parmelia (barque)|Parmelia]]''<br/>([[James Stirling (Australian governor)|Stirling]])\n|-\n|6 June || {{HMS|Sulphur|1826|6}}\n|-\n|5 August ||''Calista''\n|-\n|6 August ||''Saint Leonard''\n|-\n|23 August ||''Marquis of Anglesea''\n|-\n|19 September ||''Thompson''\n|-\n|21 September ||''[[Amity (brig)|Amity]]''\n|-\n|5 October ||''Georgiana''\n|-\n|9 October ||''Ephemina''\n|-\n|12 October ||''Orelia''\n|-\n|12 October ||{{ship||Cumberland|1827 ship|2}}\n|-\n|12 October ||''Caroline''\n|-\n|17 October ||''Governor Phillip''\n|-\n|19 October ||''Atwick''\n|-\n|23 October ||{{ship||Lotus|1826 ship|6}}<br/>John Summerson\n|-\n|31 October ||{{ship||Admiral Gifford|ship|6}}\n|-\n|11 November ||''Lion (Lyon)''\n|-\n|14 November ||''Dragon''\n|-\n|28 November ||{{HMS|Success|1825|6}}\n|-\n|15 December ||{{ship||Gilmore|1824 ship|2}}<br/>[[Thomas Peel|(Peel)]]\n|}\n\nThe first ship to reach the Swan River was {{HMS|Challenger|1826|6}}. After she anchored off [[Garden Island, Western Australia|Garden Island]] on 25 April 1829, Captain [[Charles Fremantle]] declared the Swan River Colony for [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Britain]] on 2 May 1829.\n\n''Parmelia'' arrived on 31 May carrying Stirling and his party and {{HMS|Sulphur|1826|6}} arrived on 8 June carrying members of the [[63rd Regiment of Foot|63rd Regiment]] and families. Three merchant ships arrived shortly after: ''Calista'' on 5 August, ''St Leonard'' on 6 August and ''Marquis of Anglesea'' on 23 August.\n\nA series of accidents followed the arrivals which probably nearly caused the abandonment of the expedition. ''Challenger'' and ''Sulphur'' both struck rocks while entering [[Cockburn Sound]] and were fortunate to escape with only minor damage. ''Parmelia'' however, under Stirling's \"over confident pilotage\", also ran aground, lost her rudder and damaged her keel, which necessitated extensive repairs. With winter now set in, the settlers were obliged to land on [[Garden Island, Western Australia|Garden Island]]. Bad weather and the required repairs meant that Stirling did not manage to reach the mainland until 18 June, and the remaining settlers on ''Parmelia'' finally arrived in early August. In early September a major disaster occurred: ''Marquis of Anglesea'' was driven ashore during a gale and wrecked beyond repair. The ship did not break up, as had been expected, but instead survived to become Western Australia's first [[prison ship|prison hulk]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Goulding |first=Dot |year=2007 |title=Recapturing Freedom: Issues Relating to the Release of Long-term Prisoners Into the Community |publisher=Hawkins Press |isbn=978-1876067182 |page=14 }}</ref>\n\nThe first reports of the new colony arrived back in [[England]] in late January 1830. They described the poor conditions and the starving state of the colonists, deemed the land totally unfit for agriculture, and reported (incorrectly) that the settlers had abandoned the colony. As a result of these reports, many people cancelled their migration plans or diverted to [[Cape Town]] in South Africa, or to the more well-established [[New South Wales]] colony.\n\nNevertheless, a few settlers arrived and additional stores were dispatched. By 1832 the population of the colony had reached about 1,500. Aboriginal people were not counted at that time, but in the south west have been estimated to number 15,000. The difficulty of clearing land to grow crops was so great that by 1850 the population of settlers had increased only to 5,886. This population had settled mainly around the southwestern coastline at [[Bunbury, Western Australia|Bunbury]], [[Augusta, Western Australia|Augusta]] and [[Albany, Western Australia|Albany]].\n\n[[Karl Marx]] used the Swan River Colony to illustrate a point about the necessity of a dependent workforce for capitalist production and colonization in ''[[Das Kapital]]''.<ref>{{cite book |title=Das Kapital|last=Marx|first=Karl |chapter=[[s:Das Kapital/Chapter 33#Swan River Colony |Chapter 33: The Modern Theory of Colonisation]]|authorlink=Karl Marx |title-link=Das Kapital}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{Wikisourcepar|Category:Swan River Colony}}\n*''[[General view of the botany of the vicinity of Swan River]]'', an 1831 scientific paper by Scottish botanist [[Robert Brown (botanist, born 1773)|Robert Brown]]\n*[[History of Perth, Western Australia]]\n*[[History of Western Australia]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* Fornasiero, Jean; Monteath, Peter and West-Sooby, John.

The ship did not break up, as had been expected, but instead survived to become Western Australia's first [[prison ship|prison hulk]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Goulding |first=Dot |year=2007 |title=Recapturing Freedom: Issues Relating to the Release of Long-term Prisoners Into the Community |publisher=Hawkins Press |isbn=978-1876067182 |page=14 }}</ref>\n\nThe first reports of the new colony arrived back in [[England]] in late January 1830. They described the poor conditions and the starving state of the colonists, deemed the land totally unfit for agriculture, and reported (incorrectly) that the settlers had abandoned the colony. As a result of these reports, many people cancelled their migration plans or diverted to [[Cape Town]] in South Africa, or to the more well-established [[New South Wales]] colony.\n\nNevertheless, a few settlers arrived and additional stores were dispatched. By 1832 the population of the colony had reached about 1,500. Aboriginal people were not counted at that time, but in the south west have been estimated to number 15,000. The difficulty of clearing land to grow crops was so great that by 1850 the population of settlers had increased only to 5,886. This population had settled mainly around the southwestern coastline at [[Bunbury, Western Australia|Bunbury]], [[Augusta, Western Australia|Augusta]] and [[Albany, Western Australia|Albany]].\n\n[[Karl Marx]] used the Swan River Colony to illustrate a point about the necessity of a dependent workforce for capitalist production and colonization in ''[[Das Kapital]]''.<ref>{{cite book |title=Das Kapital|last=Marx|first=Karl |chapter=[[s:Das Kapital/Chapter 33#Swan River Colony |Chapter 33: The Modern Theory of Colonisation]]|authorlink=Karl Marx |title-link=Das Kapital}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{Wikisourcepar|Category:Swan River Colony}}\n*''[[General view of the botany of the vicinity of Swan River]]'', an 1831 scientific paper by Scottish botanist [[Robert Brown (botanist, born 1773)|Robert Brown]]\n*[[History of Perth, Western Australia]]\n*[[History of Western Australia]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* Fornasiero, Jean; Monteath, Peter and West-Sooby, John.

The interval at which the DTFT is sampled is the reciprocal of the duration of the input sequence.  An inverse DFT is a [[Fourier series]], using the DTFT samples as coefficients of [[complex number|complex]] [[Sine wave|sinusoid]]s at the corresponding DTFT frequencies.  It has the same sample-values as the original input sequence.  The DFT is therefore said to be a [[frequency domain]] representation of the original input sequence.  If the original sequence spans all the non-zero values of a function, its DTFT is continuous (and periodic), and the DFT provides discrete samples of one cycle.  If the original sequence is one cycle of a periodic function, the DFT provides all the non-zero values of one DTFT cycle.\n\nThe DFT is the most important [[discrete transform]], used to perform [[Fourier analysis]] in many practical applications.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Strang|first=Gilbert|title=Wavelets|journal=American Scientist|date=May\u2013June 1994|volume=82|issue=3|pages=250\u2013255|jstor=29775194|quote=This is the most important numerical algorithm of our lifetime...}}</ref>  In [[digital signal processing]], the function is any quantity or [[signal (information theory)|signal]] that varies over time, such as the pressure of a [[sound wave]], a [[radio]] signal, or daily [[temperature]] readings, sampled over a finite time interval (often defined by a [[window function]]<ref>{{cite journal|last=Sahidullah|first=Md.|author2=Saha, Goutam|title=A Novel Windowing Technique for Efficient Computation of MFCC for Speaker Recognition|journal=IEEE Signal Processing Letters|date=Feb 2013|volume=20|issue=2|pages=149\u2013152|doi=10.1109/LSP.2012.2235067|arxiv = 1206.2437 |bibcode = 2013ISPL...20..149S }}</ref>). In [[image processing]], the samples can be the values of [[pixel]]s along a row or column of a [[raster image]]. The DFT is also used to efficiently solve [[partial differential equations]], and to perform other operations such as [[convolution]]s or multiplying large integers.\n\nSince it deals with a finite amount of data, it can be implemented in [[computer]]s by [[numerical algorithm]]s or even dedicated [[digital circuit|hardware]]. These implementations usually employ efficient [[fast Fourier transform]] (FFT) algorithms;<ref name=colley>Cooley et al., 1969</ref> so much so that the terms \"FFT\" and \"DFT\" are often used interchangeably.

Furthermore, convolutions can be used to efficiently compute DFTs via [[Rader's FFT algorithm]] and [[Bluestein's FFT algorithm]].\n\n=== Convolution theorem duality ===\n\nIt can also be shown that''':'''\n\n:<math>\n\\mathcal{F} \\left \\{ \\mathbf{x\\cdot y} \\right \\}_k \\ \\triangleq\n\\sum_{n=0}^{N-1} x_n \\cdot y_n \\cdot e^{-i \\frac{2\\pi}{N} k n}\n</math>\n::<math>=\\frac{1}{N} (\\mathbf{X * Y_N})_k, \\,</math> &nbsp; which is the circular convolution of <math>\\mathbf{X}</math> and <math>\\mathbf{Y}</math>.\n\n===Trigonometric interpolation polynomial===\nThe [[trigonometric interpolation polynomial]]\n:<math>p(t) = \\begin{cases}\n  \\frac{1}{N} \\left[ X_0 + X_1 e^{i 2\\pi t} + \\cdots + X_{N/2-1} e^{i(N/2-1) 2\\pi t} + X_{N/2} \\cos(N\\pi t) + X_{N/2+1} e^{i(-N/2+1) 2\\pi t} + \\cdots + X_{N-1} e^{-i 2\\pi t} \\right]\n  & N\\text{ even} \\\\\n  \\frac{1}{N} \\left[ X_0 + X_1 e^{i 2\\pi t} + \\cdots + X_{\\lfloor N/2 \\rfloor} e^{i \\lfloor N/2 \\rfloor 2\\pi t} + X_{\\lfloor N/2 \\rfloor+1} e^{-i \\lfloor N/2 \\rfloor 2\\pi t} + \\cdots + X_{N-1} e^{-i 2\\pi t} \\right]\n  & N\\text{ odd}\n\\end{cases}</math>\n\nwhere the coefficients ''X''<sub>''k''</sub> are given by the DFT of ''x''<sub>''n''</sub> above, satisfies the interpolation property <math>p(n/N) = x_n</math> for <math>n=0,\\ldots,N-1</math>.\n\nFor even ''N'', notice that the [[Nyquist frequency|Nyquist component]] <math>\\frac{X_{N/2}}{N} \\cos(N\\pi t)</math> is handled specially.\n\nThis interpolation is ''not unique'': aliasing implies that one could add ''N'' to any of the complex-sinusoid frequencies (e.g. changing <math>e^{-it}</math> to <math>e^{i(N-1)t}</math> ) without changing the interpolation property, but giving ''different'' values in between the <math>x_n</math> points.  The choice above, however, is typical because it has two useful properties.  First, it consists of sinusoids whose frequencies have the smallest possible magnitudes: the interpolation is [[bandlimited]]. Second, if the  <math>x_n</math> are real numbers, then <math>p(t)</math> is real as well.\n\nIn contrast, the most obvious trigonometric interpolation polynomial is the one in which the frequencies range from 0 to <math>N-1</math> (instead of roughly <math>-N/2</math> to <math>+N/2</math> as above), similar to the inverse DFT formula. This interpolation does ''not'' minimize the slope, and is ''not'' generally real-valued for real <math>x_n</math>; its use is a common mistake.\n\n=== The unitary DFT ===\nAnother way of looking at the DFT is to note that in the above discussion, the DFT can be expressed as the [[DFT matrix]], a [[Vandermonde matrix]], \n[[Generalizations of Pauli matrices#Construction: The clock and shift matrices|introduced by Sylvester]] in 1867,\n:<math>\\mathbf{F} =\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n \\omega_N^{0 \\cdot 0}     & \\omega_N^{0 \\cdot 1}     & \\ldots & \\omega_N^{0 \\cdot (N-1)}     \\\\\n \\omega_N^{1 \\cdot 0}     & \\omega_N^{1 \\cdot 1}     & \\ldots & \\omega_N^{1 \\cdot (N-1)}     \\\\\n \\vdots                   & \\vdots                   & \\ddots & \\vdots                       \\\\\n \\omega_N^{(N-1) \\cdot 0} & \\omega_N^{(N-1) \\cdot 1} & \\ldots & \\omega_N^{(N-1) \\cdot (N-1)} \\\\\n\\end{bmatrix}\n</math>\nwhere <math>\\omega_N = e^{-i 2 \\pi/N}</math> is a primitive [[roots of unity|''N''th root of unity]].\n\nThe inverse transform is then given by the inverse of the above matrix,\n:<math>\\mathbf{F}^{-1}=\\frac{1}{N}\\mathbf{F}^*</math>\n\nWith [[unitary operator|unitary]] normalization constants <math>1/\\sqrt{N}</math>, the DFT becomes a [[unitary transformation]], defined by a unitary matrix:\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n          \\mathbf{U} &= \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{N}}\\mathbf{F} \\\\\n     \\mathbf{U}^{-1} &= \\mathbf{U}^* \\\\\n  |\\det(\\mathbf{U})| &= 1\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nwhere <math>\\det()</math> is the [[determinant]] function. The determinant is the product of the eigenvalues, which are always <math>\\pm 1</math> or <math>\\pm i</math> as described below.  In a real vector space, a unitary transformation can be thought of as simply a rigid rotation of the coordinate system, and all of the properties of a rigid rotation can be found in the unitary DFT.\n\nThe orthogonality of the DFT is now expressed as an [[orthonormal]]ity condition (which arises in many areas of mathematics as described in [[root of unity]]):\n:<math>\\sum_{m=0}^{N-1}U_{km}U_{mn}^* = \\delta_{kn}</math>\n\nIf '''X'''  is defined as the unitary DFT of the vector '''x''', then\n:<math>X_k=\\sum_{n=0}^{N-1} U_{kn} x_n</math>\n\nand the [[Parseval's theorem]] is expressed as\n:<math>\\sum_{n=0}^{N-1}x_n y_n^* = \\sum_{k=0}^{N-1}X_k Y_k^*</math>\n\nIf we view the DFT as just a coordinate transformation which simply specifies the components of a vector in a new coordinate system, then the above is just the statement that the dot product of two vectors is preserved under a unitary DFT transformation. For the special case <math>\\mathbf{x} = \\mathbf{y}</math>, this implies that the length of a vector is preserved as well \u2014 this is just [[Plancherel theorem]],\n:<math>\\sum_{n=0}^{N-1}|x_n|^2 = \\sum_{k=0}^{N-1}|X_k|^2</math>\n\nA consequence of the [[Discrete Fourier transform#Circular convolution theorem and cross-correlation theorem|circular convolution theorem]] is that the DFT matrix {{mvar|F}} diagonalizes any [[circulant matrix]].\n\n=== Expressing the inverse DFT in terms of the DFT ===\nA useful property of the DFT is that the inverse DFT can be easily expressed in terms of the (forward) DFT, via several well-known \"tricks\".  (For example, in computations, it is often convenient to only implement a fast Fourier transform corresponding to one transform direction and then to get the other transform direction from the first.)\n\nFirst, we can compute the inverse DFT by reversing all but one of the inputs (Duhamel ''et al.'', 1988):\n\n:<math>\\mathcal{F}^{-1}(\\{x_n\\}) = \\frac{1}{N}\\mathcal{F}(\\{x_{N - n}\\})</math>\n\n(As usual, the subscripts are interpreted [[modular arithmetic|modulo]] ''N''; thus, for <math>n = 0</math>, we have <math>x_{N-0} = x_0</math>.)\n\nSecond, one can also conjugate the inputs and outputs:\n\n:<math>\\mathcal{F}^{-1}(\\mathbf{x}) = \\frac{1}{N}\\mathcal{F}\\left(\\mathbf{x}^*\\right)^*</math>\n\nThird, a variant of this conjugation trick, which is sometimes preferable because it requires no modification of the data values, involves swapping real and imaginary parts (which can be done on a computer simply by modifying [[pointer (computer programming)|pointer]]s). Define <math display=\"inline\">\\operatorname{swap}(x_n)</math> as <math>x_n</math> with its real and imaginary parts swapped\u2014that is, if <math>x_n = a + b i</math> then <math display=\"inline>\\operatorname{swap}(x_n)</math> is <math>b + a i</math>.  Equivalently, <math display=\"inline}>\\operatorname{swap}(x_n)</math> equals <math>i x_n^*</math>.  Then\n\n:<math>\\mathcal{F}^{-1}(\\mathbf{x}) = \\frac{1}{N}\\operatorname{swap}(\\mathcal{F}(\\operatorname{swap}(\\mathbf{x})))</math>\n\nThat is, the inverse transform is the same as the forward transform with the real and imaginary parts swapped for both input and output, up to a normalization (Duhamel ''et al.'', 1988).\n\nThe conjugation trick can also be used to define a new transform, closely related to the DFT, that is [[Involution (mathematics)|involutory]]\u2014that is, which is its own inverse.  In particular, <math>T(\\mathbf{x}) = \\mathcal{F}\\left(\\mathbf{x}^*\\right) / \\sqrt{N}</math> is clearly its own inverse: <math>T(T(\\mathbf{x})) = \\mathbf{x}</math>.  A closely related involutory transformation (by a factor of {{nowrap|(1 + ''i'')/{{radic|2}}}}) is <math>H(\\mathbf{x}) = \\mathcal{F}\\left((1 + i) \\mathbf{x}^*\\right) / \\sqrt{2N}</math>, since the <math>(1 + i)</math> factors in <math>H(H(\\mathbf{x}))</math> cancel the 2.  For real inputs <math>\\mathbf{x}</math>, the real part of <math>H(\\mathbf{x})</math> is none other than the [[discrete Hartley transform]], which is also involutory.\n\n=== Eigenvalues and eigenvectors ===\n\nThe [[eigenvalue]]s of the DFT matrix are simple and well-known, whereas the [[eigenvector]]s are complicated, not unique, and are the subject of ongoing research.\n\nConsider the unitary form <math>\\mathbf{U}</math> defined above for the DFT of length ''N'', where\n:<math>\\mathbf{U}_{m,n} = \\frac1{\\sqrt{N}}\\omega_N^{(m-1)(n-1)} = \\frac1{\\sqrt{N}}e^{-\\frac{i 2\\pi}N (m-1)(n-1)}.</math>\nThis matrix satisfies the [[matrix polynomial]] equation:\n:<math>\\mathbf{U}^4 = \\mathbf{I}.</math>\nThis can be seen from the inverse properties above: operating <math>\\mathbf{U}</math> twice gives the original data in reverse order, so operating <math>\\mathbf{U}</math> four times gives back the original data and is thus the [[identity matrix]].  This means that the eigenvalues <math>\\lambda</math> satisfy the equation:\n:<math>\\lambda^4 = 1.</math>\nTherefore, the eigenvalues of <math>\\mathbf{U}</math> are the fourth [[roots of unity]]: <math>\\lambda</math> is +1, \u22121, +''i'',  or \u2212''i''.\n\nSince there are only four distinct eigenvalues for this <math>N\\times N</math> matrix, they have some [[algebraic multiplicity|multiplicity]].  The multiplicity gives the number of [[linearly independent]] eigenvectors corresponding to each eigenvalue.  (There are ''N'' independent eigenvectors; a unitary matrix is never [[defective matrix|defective]].)\n\nThe problem of their multiplicity was solved by McClellan and Parks (1972), although it was later shown to have been equivalent to a problem solved by [[Carl Friedrich Gauss|Gauss]] (Dickinson and Steiglitz, 1982).  The multiplicity depends on the value of ''N'' [[modular arithmetic|modulo]] 4, and is given by the following table:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin:auto;\"\n|+ align=\"bottom\" | Multiplicities of the eigenvalues \u03bb of the unitary DFT matrix '''U''' as a function of the transform size ''N'' (in terms of an integer ''m'').\n|-\n! size ''N''\n! \u03bb = +1\n! \u03bb = \u22121\n! \u03bb = \u2212''i''\n! \u03bb = +''i''\n|-\n|    4''m''  ||  ''m'' + 1  ||  ''m''  ||  ''m''  ||  ''m'' \u2212 1\n|-\n|    4''m'' + 1  ||  ''m'' + 1  ||  ''m''  ||  ''m''  ||  ''m''\n|-\n|    4''m'' + 2  ||  ''m'' + 1  ||  ''m'' + 1  ||  ''m''  ||  ''m''\n|-\n|    4''m'' + 3  ||  ''m'' + 1  ||  ''m'' + 1  ||  ''m'' + 1  ||  ''m''\n|}\n\nOtherwise stated, the [[characteristic polynomial]] of <math>\\mathbf{U}</math> is:\n:<math>\\det (\\lambda I - \\mathbf{U})=\n(\\lambda-1)^{\\left\\lfloor \\tfrac {N+4}{4}\\right\\rfloor}\n(\\lambda+1)^{\\left\\lfloor \\tfrac {N+2}{4}\\right\\rfloor}\n(\\lambda+i)^{\\left\\lfloor \\tfrac {N+1}{4}\\right\\rfloor}\n(\\lambda-i)^{\\left\\lfloor \\tfrac {N-1}{4}\\right\\rfloor}.</math>\n\nNo simple analytical formula for general eigenvectors is known.   Moreover, the eigenvectors are not unique because any linear combination of eigenvectors for the same eigenvalue is also an eigenvector for that eigenvalue.  Various researchers have proposed different choices of eigenvectors, selected to satisfy useful properties like [[orthogonality]] and to have \"simple\" forms (e.g., McClellan and Parks, 1972; Dickinson and Steiglitz, 1982; Gr\u00fcnbaum, 1982; Atakishiyev and Wolf, 1997; Candan ''et al.'', 2000; Hanna ''et al.'', 2004; Gurevich and Hadani, 2008).\n\nA straightforward approach is to discretize an eigenfunction of the continuous [[Fourier transform]],\nof which the most famous is the [[Gaussian function]].\nSince [[periodic summation]] of the function means discretizing its frequency spectrum\nand discretization means periodic summation of the spectrum,\nthe discretized and periodically summed Gaussian function yields an eigenvector of the discrete transform:\n*<math>F(m) = \\sum_{k\\in\\mathbb{Z}} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\pi\\cdot(m+N\\cdot k)^2}{N}\\right)</math>.\n\nThe closed form expression for the series can be expressed by [[Jacobi theta function]]s as\n\n*<math>F(m) = \\frac1{\\sqrt{N}}\\vartheta_3\\left(\\frac{\\pi m}N, \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\pi}N \\right)\\right)</math>.\n\nTwo other simple closed-form analytical eigenvectors for special DFT period ''N'' were found (Kong, 2008):\n\nFor DFT period ''N'' = 2''L'' + 1 = 4''K'' + 1, where ''K'' is an integer, the following is an eigenvector of DFT:\n*<math>F(m)=\\prod_{s=K+1}^L\\left[\\cos\\left(\\frac{2\\pi}{N}m\\right)- \\cos\\left(\\frac{2\\pi}{N}s\\right)\\right]</math>\n\nFor DFT period ''N'' = 2''L'' = 4''K'', where ''K'' is an integer, the following is an eigenvector of DFT:\n*<math>F(m)=\\sin\\left(\\frac{2\\pi}{N}m\\right)\\prod_{s=K+1}^{L-1}\\left[\\cos\\left(\\frac{2\\pi}{N}m\\right)- \\cos\\left(\\frac{2\\pi}{N}s\\right)\\right]</math>\n\nThe choice of eigenvectors of the DFT matrix has become important in recent years in order to define a discrete analogue of the [[fractional Fourier transform]]\u2014the DFT matrix can be taken to fractional powers by exponentiating the eigenvalues (e.g., Rubio and Santhanam, 2005).  For the [[continuous Fourier transform]], the natural orthogonal eigenfunctions are the [[Hermite function]]s, so various discrete analogues of these have been employed as the eigenvectors of the DFT, such as the [[Kravchuk polynomials]] (Atakishiyev and Wolf, 1997).  The \"best\" choice of eigenvectors to define a fractional discrete Fourier transform remains an open question, however.\n\n=== Uncertainty principles ===\n==== Probabilistic uncertainty principle ====\nIf the random variable {{math|''X''<sub>''k''</sub>}} is constrained by\n:<math>\\sum_{n=0}^{N-1}|X_n|^2=1  ~,</math>\nthen \n:<math>P_n=|X_n|^2</math> \nmay be considered to represent a discrete [[probability mass function]] of {{mvar|n}}, with an associated probability mass function constructed from the transformed variable,\n:<math>Q_m=N|x_m|^2 ~.</math>\n\nFor the case of continuous functions <math>P(x)</math> and <math>Q(k)</math>, the [[Heisenberg uncertainty principle]] states that\n:<math>D_0(X)D_0(x)\\ge\\frac{1}{16\\pi^2}</math>\nwhere  <math>D_0(X)</math> and <math>D_0(x)</math> are the variances of <math>|X|^2</math> and <math>|x|^2</math> respectively, with the equality attained in the case of a suitably normalized [[Gaussian distribution]]. Although the variances may be analogously defined for the DFT, an analogous uncertainty principle is not useful, because the uncertainty will not be shift-invariant. Still, a meaningful uncertainty principle has been introduced by Massar and Spindel.<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Massar | first1 = S. | last2 = Spindel | first2 = P. | doi = 10.1103/PhysRevLett.100.190401 | title = Uncertainty Relation for the Discrete Fourier Transform | journal = Physical Review Letters | volume = 100 | issue = 19 | year = 2008 | pmid =  18518426| pmc = |arxiv = 0710.0723 |bibcode = 2008PhRvL.100s0401M | page=190401}}</ref>\n\nHowever, the Hirschman [[entropic uncertainty]] will have a useful analog for the case of the DFT.<ref name=\"DeBrunner\">{{cite journal |last1=DeBrunner |first1=Victor |last2=Havlicek |first2=Joseph P. |last3=Przebinda |first3=Tomasz|last4=\u00d6zaydin |first4=Murad|year=2005 |title=Entropy-Based Uncertainty Measures for <math>L^2(\\mathbb{R}^n),\\ell^2(\\mathbb{Z})</math>, and <math>\\ell^2(\\mathbb{Z}/N\\mathbb{Z})</math> With a Hirschman Optimal Transform for <math>\\ell^2(\\mathbb{Z}/N\\mathbb{Z})</math> |journal=IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing |volume=53 |issue=8 |page=2690 |doi=  10.1109/TSP.2005.850329|url=http://redwood.berkeley.edu/w/images/9/95/2002-26.pdf |accessdate=2011-06-23 |bibcode = 2005ITSP...53.2690D }}</ref> The Hirschman uncertainty principle is expressed in terms of the [[Entropy (information theory)|Shannon entropy]] of the two probability functions.\n\nIn the discrete case, the Shannon entropies are defined as\n:<math>H(X)=-\\sum_{n=0}^{N-1} P_n\\ln P_n</math>\nand\n:<math>H(x)=-\\sum_{m=0}^{N-1} Q_m\\ln Q_m ~,</math>\nand the [[entropic uncertainty]] principle becomes<ref name=\"DeBrunner\"/>\n:<math>H(X)+H(x) \\ge \\ln(N) ~.</math>\n\nThe equality is obtained for <math>P_n</math> equal to translations and modulations of a suitably normalized [[Kronecker comb]] of period <math>A</math> where <math>A</math> is any exact integer divisor of <math>N</math>.

This is sometimes known as a '''generalized DFT''' (or '''GDFT'''), also called the '''shifted DFT''' or '''offset DFT''', and has analogous properties to the ordinary DFT:\n\n:<math>X_k = \\sum_{n=0}^{N-1} x_n e^{-\\frac{i 2 \\pi}{N} (k+b) (n+a)} \\quad \\quad k = 0, \\dots, N-1.</math>\n\nMost often, shifts of <math>1/2</math> (half a sample) are used.\nWhile the ordinary DFT corresponds to a periodic signal in both time and frequency domains, <math>a=1/2</math> produces a signal that is anti-periodic in frequency domain (<math>X_{k+N} = - X_k</math>) and vice versa for <math>b=1/2</math>.\nThus, the specific case of <math>a = b = 1/2</math> is known as an ''odd-time odd-frequency'' discrete Fourier transform (or O<sup>2</sup> DFT).\nSuch shifted transforms are most often used for symmetric data, to represent different boundary symmetries, and for real-symmetric data they correspond to different forms of the discrete [[discrete cosine transform|cosine]] and [[discrete sine transform|sine]] transforms.\n\nAnother interesting choice is <math>a=b=-(N-1)/2</math>, which is called the '''centered DFT''' (or '''CDFT''').  The centered DFT has the useful property that, when ''N'' is a multiple of four, all four of its eigenvalues (see above) have equal multiplicities (Rubio and Santhanam, 2005)<ref>Santhanam, Balu; Santhanam, Thalanayar S.

In the two-dimensional case <math>x_{n_1,n_2}</math> the <math>N_1</math> independent DFTs of the rows (i.e., along <math>n_2</math>) are computed first to form a new array <math>y_{n_1,k_2}</math>. Then the <math>N_2</math> independent DFTs of ''y'' along the columns (along <math>n_1</math>) are computed to form the final result <math>X_{k_1,k_2}</math>.  Alternatively the columns can be computed first and then the rows. The order is immaterial because the nested summations above [[commutative operation|commute]].\n\nAn algorithm to compute a one-dimensional DFT is thus sufficient to efficiently compute a multidimensional DFT.  This approach is known as the ''row-column'' algorithm. There are also intrinsically [[Fast Fourier transform#Multidimensional FFTs|multidimensional FFT algorithms]].\n\n=== The real-input multidimensional DFT ===\nFor input data <math>x_{n_1, n_2, \\dots, n_d}</math> consisting of [[real numbers]], the DFT outputs have a conjugate symmetry similar to the one-dimensional case above:\n\n:<math>X_{k_1, k_2, \\dots, k_d} = X_{N_1 - k_1, N_2 - k_2, \\dots, N_d - k_d}^* ,</math>\n\nwhere the star again denotes complex conjugation and the <math>\\ell</math>-th subscript is again interpreted modulo <math>N_\\ell</math> (for <math>\\ell = 1,2,\\ldots,d</math>).\n\n== Applications ==\nThe DFT has seen wide usage across a large number of fields; we only sketch a few examples below (see also the references at the end). All applications of the DFT depend crucially on the availability of a fast algorithm to compute discrete Fourier transforms and their inverses, a [[fast Fourier transform]].\n\n=== Spectral analysis ===\nWhen the DFT is used for [[signal spectral analysis]], the <math>\\{x_n\\}\\,</math> sequence usually represents a finite set of uniformly spaced time-samples of some signal <math>x(t)\\,</math>, where <math>t</math> represents time.  The conversion from continuous time to samples (discrete-time) changes the underlying [[continuous Fourier transform|Fourier transform]] of <math>x(t)</math> into a [[discrete-time Fourier transform]] (DTFT), which generally entails a type of distortion called [[aliasing]].  Choice of an appropriate sample-rate (see ''[[Nyquist rate]]'') is the key to minimizing that distortion.  Similarly, the conversion from a very long (or infinite) sequence to a manageable size entails a type of distortion called ''[[Spectral leakage|leakage]]'', which is manifested as a loss of detail (a.k.a. resolution) in the DTFT.  Choice of an appropriate sub-sequence length is the primary key to minimizing that effect.  When the available data (and time to process it) is more than the amount needed to attain the desired frequency resolution, a standard technique is to perform multiple DFTs, for example to create a [[spectrogram]].  If the desired result is a power spectrum and noise or randomness is present in the data, averaging the magnitude components of the multiple DFTs is a useful procedure to reduce the [[variance]] of the spectrum (also called a [[periodogram]] in this context); two examples of such techniques are the [[Welch method]] and the [[Bartlett method]]; the general subject of estimating the power spectrum of a noisy signal is called [[spectral estimation]].\n\nA final source of distortion (or perhaps ''illusion'') is the DFT itself, because it is just a discrete sampling of the DTFT, which is a function of a continuous frequency domain.  That can be mitigated by increasing the resolution of the DFT.  That procedure is illustrated at {{slink|Discrete-time Fourier transform|Sampling the DTFT|nopage=y}}.\n*The procedure is sometimes referred to as ''zero-padding'', which is a particular implementation used in conjunction with the [[fast Fourier transform]] (FFT) algorithm.  The inefficiency of performing multiplications and additions with zero-valued \"samples\" is more than offset by the inherent efficiency of the FFT.\n*As already stated, leakage imposes a limit on the inherent resolution of the DTFT, so there is a practical limit to the benefit that can be obtained from a fine-grained DFT.\n\n=== Filter bank ===\nSee {{slink|Filter bank|FFT filter banks|nopage=y}} and {{slink|Discrete-time Fourier transform|Sampling the DTFT|nopage=y}}.\n\n===Data compression===\nThe field of digital signal processing relies heavily on operations in the frequency domain (i.e. on the Fourier transform). For example, several [[lossy]] image and sound compression methods employ the discrete Fourier transform: the signal is cut into short segments, each is transformed, and then the Fourier coefficients of high frequencies, which are assumed to be unnoticeable, are discarded. The decompressor computes the inverse transform based on this reduced number of Fourier coefficients. (Compression applications often use a specialized form of the DFT, the [[discrete cosine transform]] or sometimes the [[modified discrete cosine transform]].)\nSome relatively recent compression algorithms, however, use [[wavelet transform]]s, which give a more uniform compromise between time and frequency domain than obtained by chopping data into segments and transforming each segment.  In the case of [[JPEG2000]], this avoids the spurious image features that appear when images are highly compressed with the original [[JPEG]].\n\n===Partial differential equations===\nDiscrete Fourier transforms are often used to solve [[partial differential equations]], where again the DFT is used as an approximation for the [[Fourier series]] (which is recovered in the limit of infinite ''N''). The advantage of this approach is that it expands the signal in complex exponentials <math>e^{inx}</math>, which are eigenfunctions of differentiation: <math>{\\text{d} \\big( e^{inx} \\big) }/\\text{d}x = in e^{inx}</math>. Thus, in the Fourier representation, differentiation is simple\u2014we just multiply by <math>in</math>.  (However, the choice of <math>n</math> is not unique due to aliasing; for the method to be convergent, a choice similar to that in the [[Discrete Fourier transform#Trigonometric interpolation polynomial|trigonometric interpolation]] section above should be used.) A [[linear differential equation]] with constant coefficients is transformed into an easily solvable algebraic equation. One then uses the inverse DFT to transform the result back into the ordinary spatial representation. Such an approach is called a [[spectral method]].\n\n===Polynomial multiplication===\n\nSuppose we wish to compute the polynomial product ''c''(''x'') = ''a''(''x'') \u00b7 ''b''(''x'').  The ordinary product expression for the coefficients of ''c'' involves a linear (acyclic) convolution, where indices do not \"wrap around.\"  This can be rewritten as a cyclic convolution by taking the coefficient vectors for ''a''(''x'') and ''b''(''x'') with constant term first, then appending zeros so that the resultant coefficient vectors '''a''' and '''b''' have dimension ''d''&nbsp;>&nbsp;deg(''a''(''x''))&nbsp;+&nbsp;deg(''b''(''x'')).  Then,\n\n:<math>\\mathbf{c} = \\mathbf{a} * \\mathbf{b}</math>\n\nWhere '''c''' is the vector of coefficients for ''c''(''x''), and the convolution operator <math>*\\,</math> is defined so\n\n:<math>c_n = \\sum_{m=0}^{d-1}a_m b_{n-m\\ \\mathrm{mod}\\ d} \\qquad\\qquad\\qquad n=0,1\\dots,d-1</math>\n\nBut convolution becomes multiplication under the DFT:\n\n:<math>\\mathcal{F}(\\mathbf{c}) = \\mathcal{F}(\\mathbf{a})\\mathcal{F}(\\mathbf{b})</math>\n\nHere the vector product is taken elementwise.  Thus the coefficients of the product polynomial ''c''(''x'') are just the terms 0, ..., deg(''a''(''x'')) + deg(''b''(''x'')) of the coefficient vector\n\n:<math>\\mathbf{c} = \\mathcal{F}^{-1}(\\mathcal{F}(\\mathbf{a})\\mathcal{F}(\\mathbf{b})).</math>\n\nWith a [[fast Fourier transform]], the resulting algorithm takes O (''N''&nbsp;log&nbsp;''N'') arithmetic operations.  Due to its simplicity and speed, the [[Cooley\u2013Tukey FFT algorithm]], which is limited to [[composite number|composite]] sizes, is often chosen for the transform operation.  In this case, ''d'' should be chosen as the smallest integer greater than the sum of the input polynomial degrees that is factorizable into small prime factors (e.g. 2, 3, and 5, depending upon the FFT implementation).\n\n====Multiplication of large integers====\n\nThe fastest known [[multiplication algorithms|algorithms]] for the multiplication of very large [[integer]]s use the polynomial multiplication method outlined above.  Integers can be treated as the value of a polynomial evaluated specifically at the number base, with the coefficients of the polynomial corresponding to the digits in that base (ex. <math>123 = 1 \\cdot 10^2 + 2 \\cdot 10^1 + 3 \\cdot 10^0</math>).  After polynomial multiplication, a relatively low-complexity carry-propagation step completes the multiplication.\n\n==== Convolution  ====\nWhen data is [[Convolution|convolved]] with a function with wide support, such as for downsampling by a large sampling ratio, because of the [[Convolution theorem]] and the FFT algorithm, it may be faster to transform it, multiply pointwise by the transform of the filter and then reverse transform it.  Alternatively, a good filter is obtained by simply truncating the transformed data and re-transforming the shortened data set.\n\n==Some discrete Fourier transform pairs==\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n|+ '''Some DFT pairs'''\n|-\n! <math>x_n = \\frac{1}{N}\\sum_{k=0}^{N-1}X_k  e^{i 2 \\pi kn/N} </math>\n! <math>X_k = \\sum_{n=0}^{N-1}x_n  e^{-i 2 \\pi kn/N} </math>\n!

In other words, a sequence of <math>n</math> complex numbers can be thought of as an element of <math>n</math>-dimensional complex space <math>\\mathbb{C}^n</math> or equivalently a function <math>f</math> from the finite cyclic group of order <math>n</math> to the complex numbers, <math>\\mathbb{Z}_n \\mapsto \\mathbb{C}</math>. So  <math>f</math> is a [[class function]] on the finite cyclic group, and thus can be expressed as a linear combination of the irreducible characters of this group, which are the roots of unity.\n\nFrom this point of view, one may generalize the DFT to representation theory generally, or more narrowly to the [[representation theory of finite groups]].\n\nMore narrowly still, one may generalize the DFT by either changing the target (taking values in a field other than the complex numbers), or the domain (a group other than a finite cyclic group), as detailed in the sequel.\n\n=== Other fields ===\n{{Main|Discrete Fourier transform (general)|Number-theoretic transform}}\nMany of the properties of the DFT only depend on the fact that <math>e^{-\\frac{i 2 \\pi}{N}}</math> is a [[primitive root of unity]], sometimes denoted <math>\\omega_N</math> or <math>W_N</math> (so that <math>\\omega_N^N = 1</math>).  Such properties include the completeness, orthogonality, Plancherel/Parseval, periodicity, shift, convolution, and unitarity properties above, as well as many FFT algorithms. For this reason, the discrete Fourier transform can be defined by using roots of unity in [[field (mathematics)|fields]] other than the complex numbers, and such generalizations are commonly called ''number-theoretic transforms'' (NTTs) in the case of [[finite field]]s. For more information, see [[number-theoretic transform]] and [[discrete Fourier transform (general)]].\n\n=== Other finite groups ===\n{{Main|Fourier transform on finite groups}}\nThe standard DFT acts on a sequence ''x''<sub>0</sub>, ''x''<sub>1</sub>, ..., ''x''<sub>''N''&minus;1</sub> of complex numbers, which can be viewed as a function {0, 1, ..., ''N'' &minus; 1} \u2192 '''C'''. The multidimensional DFT acts on multidimensional sequences, which can be viewed as functions\n:<math> \\{0, 1, \\ldots, N_1-1\\} \\times \\cdots \\times \\{0, 1, \\ldots, N_d-1\\} \\to \\mathbb{C}. </math>\nThis suggests the generalization to [[Fourier transform on finite groups|Fourier transforms on arbitrary finite groups]], which act on functions ''G'' \u2192 '''C''' where ''G'' is a [[finite group]]. In this framework, the standard DFT is seen as the Fourier transform on a [[cyclic group]], while the multidimensional DFT is a Fourier transform on a direct sum of cyclic groups.\n\nFurther, Fourier transform can be on cosets of a group.\n\n==Alternatives==\n{{Main|Discrete wavelet transform}}\n{{details|Discrete wavelet transform#Comparison with Fourier transform}} There are various alternatives to the DFT for various applications, prominent among which are [[wavelets]]. The analog of the DFT is the [[discrete wavelet transform]] (DWT). From the point of view of [[time\u2013frequency analysis]], a key limitation of the Fourier transform is that it does not include ''location'' information, only ''frequency'' information, and thus has difficulty in representing transients. As wavelets have location as well as frequency, they are better able to represent location, at the expense of greater difficulty representing frequency.

The interval at which the DTFT is sampled is the reciprocal of the duration of the input sequence.  An inverse DFT is a [[Fourier series]], using the DTFT samples as coefficients of [[complex number|complex]] [[Sine wave|sinusoid]]s at the corresponding DTFT frequencies.  It has the same sample-values as the original input sequence.  The DFT is therefore said to be a [[frequency domain]] representation of the original input sequence.  If the original sequence spans all the non-zero values of a function, its DTFT is continuous (and periodic), and the DFT provides discrete samples of one cycle.  If the original sequence is one cycle of a periodic function, the DFT provides all the non-zero values of one DTFT cycle.\n\nThe DFT is the most important [[discrete transform]], used to perform [[Fourier analysis]] in many practical applications.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Strang|first=Gilbert|title=Wavelets|journal=American Scientist|date=May\u2013June 1994|volume=82|issue=3|pages=250\u2013255|jstor=29775194|quote=This is the most important numerical algorithm of our lifetime...}}</ref>  In [[digital signal processing]], the function is any quantity or [[signal (information theory)|signal]] that varies over time, such as the pressure of a [[sound wave]], a [[radio]] signal, or daily [[temperature]] readings, sampled over a finite time interval (often defined by a [[window function]]<ref>{{cite journal|last=Sahidullah|first=Md.|author2=Saha, Goutam|title=A Novel Windowing Technique for Efficient Computation of MFCC for Speaker Recognition|journal=IEEE Signal Processing Letters|date=Feb 2013|volume=20|issue=2|pages=149\u2013152|doi=10.1109/LSP.2012.2235067|arxiv = 1206.2437 |bibcode = 2013ISPL...20..149S }}</ref>).

(For example, in computations, it is often convenient to only implement a fast Fourier transform corresponding to one transform direction and then to get the other transform direction from the first.)\n\nFirst, we can compute the inverse DFT by reversing all but one of the inputs (Duhamel ''et al.'', 1988):\n\n:<math>\\mathcal{F}^{-1}(\\{x_n\\}) = \\frac{1}{N}\\mathcal{F}(\\{x_{N - n}\\})</math>\n\n(As usual, the subscripts are interpreted [[modular arithmetic|modulo]] ''N''; thus, for <math>n = 0</math>, we have <math>x_{N-0} = x_0</math>.)\n\nSecond, one can also conjugate the inputs and outputs:\n\n:<math>\\mathcal{F}^{-1}(\\mathbf{x}) = \\frac{1}{N}\\mathcal{F}\\left(\\mathbf{x}^*\\right)^*</math>\n\nThird, a variant of this conjugation trick, which is sometimes preferable because it requires no modification of the data values, involves swapping real and imaginary parts (which can be done on a computer simply by modifying [[pointer (computer programming)|pointer]]s). Define <math display=\"inline\">\\operatorname{swap}(x_n)</math> as <math>x_n</math> with its real and imaginary parts swapped\u2014that is, if <math>x_n = a + b i</math> then <math display=\"inline>\\operatorname{swap}(x_n)</math> is <math>b + a i</math>.  Equivalently, <math display=\"inline}>\\operatorname{swap}(x_n)</math> equals <math>i x_n^*</math>.  Then\n\n:<math>\\mathcal{F}^{-1}(\\mathbf{x}) = \\frac{1}{N}\\operatorname{swap}(\\mathcal{F}(\\operatorname{swap}(\\mathbf{x})))</math>\n\nThat is, the inverse transform is the same as the forward transform with the real and imaginary parts swapped for both input and output, up to a normalization (Duhamel ''et al.'', 1988).\n\nThe conjugation trick can also be used to define a new transform, closely related to the DFT, that is [[Involution (mathematics)|involutory]]\u2014that is, which is its own inverse.  In particular, <math>T(\\mathbf{x}) = \\mathcal{F}\\left(\\mathbf{x}^*\\right) / \\sqrt{N}</math> is clearly its own inverse: <math>T(T(\\mathbf{x})) = \\mathbf{x}</math>.  A closely related involutory transformation (by a factor of {{nowrap|(1 + ''i'')/{{radic|2}}}}) is <math>H(\\mathbf{x}) = \\mathcal{F}\\left((1 + i) \\mathbf{x}^*\\right) / \\sqrt{2N}</math>, since the <math>(1 + i)</math> factors in <math>H(H(\\mathbf{x}))</math> cancel the 2.  For real inputs <math>\\mathbf{x}</math>, the real part of <math>H(\\mathbf{x})</math> is none other than the [[discrete Hartley transform]], which is also involutory.\n\n=== Eigenvalues and eigenvectors ===\n\nThe [[eigenvalue]]s of the DFT matrix are simple and well-known, whereas the [[eigenvector]]s are complicated, not unique, and are the subject of ongoing research.\n\nConsider the unitary form <math>\\mathbf{U}</math> defined above for the DFT of length ''N'', where\n:<math>\\mathbf{U}_{m,n} = \\frac1{\\sqrt{N}}\\omega_N^{(m-1)(n-1)} = \\frac1{\\sqrt{N}}e^{-\\frac{i 2\\pi}N (m-1)(n-1)}.</math>\nThis matrix satisfies the [[matrix polynomial]] equation:\n:<math>\\mathbf{U}^4 = \\mathbf{I}.</math>\nThis can be seen from the inverse properties above: operating <math>\\mathbf{U}</math> twice gives the original data in reverse order, so operating <math>\\mathbf{U}</math> four times gives back the original data and is thus the [[identity matrix]].  This means that the eigenvalues <math>\\lambda</math> satisfy the equation:\n:<math>\\lambda^4 = 1.</math>\nTherefore, the eigenvalues of <math>\\mathbf{U}</math> are the fourth [[roots of unity]]: <math>\\lambda</math> is +1, \u22121, +''i'',  or \u2212''i''.\n\nSince there are only four distinct eigenvalues for this <math>N\\times N</math> matrix, they have some [[algebraic multiplicity|multiplicity]].  The multiplicity gives the number of [[linearly independent]] eigenvectors corresponding to each eigenvalue.  (There are ''N'' independent eigenvectors; a unitary matrix is never [[defective matrix|defective]].)\n\nThe problem of their multiplicity was solved by McClellan and Parks (1972), although it was later shown to have been equivalent to a problem solved by [[Carl Friedrich Gauss|Gauss]] (Dickinson and Steiglitz, 1982).  The multiplicity depends on the value of ''N'' [[modular arithmetic|modulo]] 4, and is given by the following table:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin:auto;\"\n|+ align=\"bottom\" | Multiplicities of the eigenvalues \u03bb of the unitary DFT matrix '''U''' as a function of the transform size ''N'' (in terms of an integer ''m'').\n|-\n! size ''N''\n! \u03bb = +1\n! \u03bb = \u22121\n! \u03bb = \u2212''i''\n! \u03bb = +''i''\n|-\n|    4''m''  ||  ''m'' + 1  ||  ''m''  ||  ''m''  ||  ''m'' \u2212 1\n|-\n|    4''m'' + 1  ||  ''m'' + 1  ||  ''m''  ||  ''m''  ||  ''m''\n|-\n|    4''m'' + 2  ||  ''m'' + 1  ||  ''m'' + 1  ||  ''m''  ||  ''m''\n|-\n|    4''m'' + 3  ||  ''m'' + 1  ||  ''m'' + 1  ||  ''m'' + 1  ||  ''m''\n|}\n\nOtherwise stated, the [[characteristic polynomial]] of <math>\\mathbf{U}</math> is:\n:<math>\\det (\\lambda I - \\mathbf{U})=\n(\\lambda-1)^{\\left\\lfloor \\tfrac {N+4}{4}\\right\\rfloor}\n(\\lambda+1)^{\\left\\lfloor \\tfrac {N+2}{4}\\right\\rfloor}\n(\\lambda+i)^{\\left\\lfloor \\tfrac {N+1}{4}\\right\\rfloor}\n(\\lambda-i)^{\\left\\lfloor \\tfrac {N-1}{4}\\right\\rfloor}.</math>\n\nNo simple analytical formula for general eigenvectors is known.   Moreover, the eigenvectors are not unique because any linear combination of eigenvectors for the same eigenvalue is also an eigenvector for that eigenvalue.  Various researchers have proposed different choices of eigenvectors, selected to satisfy useful properties like [[orthogonality]] and to have \"simple\" forms (e.g., McClellan and Parks, 1972; Dickinson and Steiglitz, 1982; Gr\u00fcnbaum, 1982; Atakishiyev and Wolf, 1997; Candan ''et al.'', 2000; Hanna ''et al.'', 2004; Gurevich and Hadani, 2008).\n\nA straightforward approach is to discretize an eigenfunction of the continuous [[Fourier transform]],\nof which the most famous is the [[Gaussian function]].\nSince [[periodic summation]] of the function means discretizing its frequency spectrum\nand discretization means periodic summation of the spectrum,\nthe discretized and periodically summed Gaussian function yields an eigenvector of the discrete transform:\n*<math>F(m) = \\sum_{k\\in\\mathbb{Z}} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\pi\\cdot(m+N\\cdot k)^2}{N}\\right)</math>.\n\nThe closed form expression for the series can be expressed by [[Jacobi theta function]]s as\n\n*<math>F(m) = \\frac1{\\sqrt{N}}\\vartheta_3\\left(\\frac{\\pi m}N, \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\pi}N \\right)\\right)</math>.\n\nTwo other simple closed-form analytical eigenvectors for special DFT period ''N'' were found (Kong, 2008):\n\nFor DFT period ''N'' = 2''L'' + 1 = 4''K'' + 1, where ''K'' is an integer, the following is an eigenvector of DFT:\n*<math>F(m)=\\prod_{s=K+1}^L\\left[\\cos\\left(\\frac{2\\pi}{N}m\\right)- \\cos\\left(\\frac{2\\pi}{N}s\\right)\\right]</math>\n\nFor DFT period ''N'' = 2''L'' = 4''K'', where ''K'' is an integer, the following is an eigenvector of DFT:\n*<math>F(m)=\\sin\\left(\\frac{2\\pi}{N}m\\right)\\prod_{s=K+1}^{L-1}\\left[\\cos\\left(\\frac{2\\pi}{N}m\\right)- \\cos\\left(\\frac{2\\pi}{N}s\\right)\\right]</math>\n\nThe choice of eigenvectors of the DFT matrix has become important in recent years in order to define a discrete analogue of the [[fractional Fourier transform]]\u2014the DFT matrix can be taken to fractional powers by exponentiating the eigenvalues (e.g., Rubio and Santhanam, 2005).  For the [[continuous Fourier transform]], the natural orthogonal eigenfunctions are the [[Hermite function]]s, so various discrete analogues of these have been employed as the eigenvectors of the DFT, such as the [[Kravchuk polynomials]] (Atakishiyev and Wolf, 1997).  The \"best\" choice of eigenvectors to define a fractional discrete Fourier transform remains an open question, however.\n\n=== Uncertainty principles ===\n==== Probabilistic uncertainty principle ====\nIf the random variable {{math|''X''<sub>''k''</sub>}} is constrained by\n:<math>\\sum_{n=0}^{N-1}|X_n|^2=1  ~,</math>\nthen \n:<math>P_n=|X_n|^2</math> \nmay be considered to represent a discrete [[probability mass function]] of {{mvar|n}}, with an associated probability mass function constructed from the transformed variable,\n:<math>Q_m=N|x_m|^2 ~.</math>\n\nFor the case of continuous functions <math>P(x)</math> and <math>Q(k)</math>, the [[Heisenberg uncertainty principle]] states that\n:<math>D_0(X)D_0(x)\\ge\\frac{1}{16\\pi^2}</math>\nwhere  <math>D_0(X)</math> and <math>D_0(x)</math> are the variances of <math>|X|^2</math> and <math>|x|^2</math> respectively, with the equality attained in the case of a suitably normalized [[Gaussian distribution]]. Although the variances may be analogously defined for the DFT, an analogous uncertainty principle is not useful, because the uncertainty will not be shift-invariant. Still, a meaningful uncertainty principle has been introduced by Massar and Spindel.<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Massar | first1 = S. | last2 = Spindel | first2 = P. | doi = 10.1103/PhysRevLett.100.190401 | title = Uncertainty Relation for the Discrete Fourier Transform | journal = Physical Review Letters | volume = 100 | issue = 19 | year = 2008 | pmid =  18518426| pmc = |arxiv = 0710.0723 |bibcode = 2008PhRvL.100s0401M | page=190401}}</ref>\n\nHowever, the Hirschman [[entropic uncertainty]] will have a useful analog for the case of the DFT.<ref name=\"DeBrunner\">{{cite journal |last1=DeBrunner |first1=Victor |last2=Havlicek |first2=Joseph P. |last3=Przebinda |first3=Tomasz|last4=\u00d6zaydin |first4=Murad|year=2005 |title=Entropy-Based Uncertainty Measures for <math>L^2(\\mathbb{R}^n),\\ell^2(\\mathbb{Z})</math>, and <math>\\ell^2(\\mathbb{Z}/N\\mathbb{Z})</math> With a Hirschman Optimal Transform for <math>\\ell^2(\\mathbb{Z}/N\\mathbb{Z})</math> |journal=IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing |volume=53 |issue=8 |page=2690 |doi=  10.1109/TSP.2005.850329|url=http://redwood.berkeley.edu/w/images/9/95/2002-26.pdf |accessdate=2011-06-23 |bibcode = 2005ITSP...53.2690D }}</ref> The Hirschman uncertainty principle is expressed in terms of the [[Entropy (information theory)|Shannon entropy]] of the two probability functions.\n\nIn the discrete case, the Shannon entropies are defined as\n:<math>H(X)=-\\sum_{n=0}^{N-1} P_n\\ln P_n</math>\nand\n:<math>H(x)=-\\sum_{m=0}^{N-1} Q_m\\ln Q_m ~,</math>\nand the [[entropic uncertainty]] principle becomes<ref name=\"DeBrunner\"/>\n:<math>H(X)+H(x) \\ge \\ln(N) ~.</math>\n\nThe equality is obtained for <math>P_n</math> equal to translations and modulations of a suitably normalized [[Kronecker comb]] of period <math>A</math> where <math>A</math> is any exact integer divisor of <math>N</math>.

This is sometimes known as a '''generalized DFT''' (or '''GDFT'''), also called the '''shifted DFT''' or '''offset DFT''', and has analogous properties to the ordinary DFT:\n\n:<math>X_k = \\sum_{n=0}^{N-1} x_n e^{-\\frac{i 2 \\pi}{N} (k+b) (n+a)} \\quad \\quad k = 0, \\dots, N-1.</math>\n\nMost often, shifts of <math>1/2</math> (half a sample) are used.\nWhile the ordinary DFT corresponds to a periodic signal in both time and frequency domains, <math>a=1/2</math> produces a signal that is anti-periodic in frequency domain (<math>X_{k+N} = - X_k</math>) and vice versa for <math>b=1/2</math>.\nThus, the specific case of <math>a = b = 1/2</math> is known as an ''odd-time odd-frequency'' discrete Fourier transform (or O<sup>2</sup> DFT).\nSuch shifted transforms are most often used for symmetric data, to represent different boundary symmetries, and for real-symmetric data they correspond to different forms of the discrete [[discrete cosine transform|cosine]] and [[discrete sine transform|sine]] transforms.\n\nAnother interesting choice is <math>a=b=-(N-1)/2</math>, which is called the '''centered DFT''' (or '''CDFT''').  The centered DFT has the useful property that, when ''N'' is a multiple of four, all four of its eigenvalues (see above) have equal multiplicities (Rubio and Santhanam, 2005)<ref>Santhanam, Balu; Santhanam, Thalanayar S.

Hence, GDFT method provides a generalization for constant amplitude orthogonal block transforms including linear and non-linear phase types. GDFT is a framework \nto improve time and frequency domain properties of the traditional DFT, e.g. auto/cross-correlations, by the addition of the properly designed phase shaping function (non-linear, in general) to the original linear phase functions (Akansu and Agirman-Tosun, 2010).<ref>Akansu, Ali N.; Agirman-Tosun, Handan \n[http://web.njit.edu/~akansu/PAPERS/AkansuIEEE-TSP2010.pdf \"''Generalized Discrete Fourier Transform With Nonlinear Phase''\"], IEEE ''Transactions on Signal Processing'', vol. 58, no. 9, pp. 4547\u20134556, Sept. 2010.</ref>\n\nThe discrete Fourier transform can be viewed as a special case of the [[z-transform]], evaluated on the unit circle in the complex plane; more general z-transforms correspond to ''complex'' shifts ''a'' and ''b'' above.\n\n==Multidimensional DFT==<!-- This section is linked from [[Fast Fourier transform]] -->\nThe ordinary DFT transforms a one-dimensional sequence or [[matrix (mathematics)|array]] <math>x_n</math> that is a function of exactly one discrete variable ''n''.  The multidimensional DFT of a multidimensional array <math>x_{n_1, n_2, \\dots, n_d}</math> that is a function of ''d'' discrete variables <math>n_\\ell = 0, 1, \\dots, N_\\ell-1</math> for <math>\\ell</math> in <math>1, 2, \\dots, d</math> is defined by:\n\n:<math>X_{k_1, k_2, \\dots, k_d} = \\sum_{n_1=0}^{N_1-1} \\left(\\omega_{N_1}^{~k_1 n_1} \\sum_{n_2=0}^{N_2-1} \\left( \\omega_{N_2}^{~k_2 n_2} \\cdots \\sum_{n_d=0}^{N_d-1} \\omega_{N_d}^{~k_d n_d}\\cdot x_{n_1, n_2, \\dots, n_d} \\right) \\right) \\, , </math>\n\nwhere <math>\\omega_{N_\\ell} = \\exp(-i 2\\pi/N_\\ell)</math> as above and the ''d'' output indices run from <math>k_\\ell = 0, 1, \\dots, N_\\ell-1</math>.  This is more compactly expressed in [[coordinate vector|vector]] notation, where we define <math>\\mathbf{n} = (n_1, n_2, \\dots, n_d)</math> and <math>\\mathbf{k} = (k_1, k_2, \\dots, k_d)</math> as ''d''-dimensional vectors of indices from 0 to <math>\\mathbf{N} - 1</math>, which we define as <math>\\mathbf{N} - 1 = (N_1 - 1, N_2 - 1, \\dots, N_d - 1)</math>:\n\n:<math>X_\\mathbf{k} = \\sum_{\\mathbf{n}=\\mathbf{0}}^{\\mathbf{N}-1} e^{-i 2\\pi \\mathbf{k} \\cdot (\\mathbf{n} / \\mathbf{N})} x_\\mathbf{n} \\, ,</math>\n\nwhere the division <math>\\mathbf{n} / \\mathbf{N}</math> is defined as <math>\\mathbf{n} / \\mathbf{N} = (n_1/N_1, \\dots, n_d/N_d)</math> to be performed element-wise, and the sum denotes the set of nested summations above.\n\nThe inverse of the multi-dimensional DFT is, analogous to the one-dimensional case, given by:\n\n:<math>x_\\mathbf{n} = \\frac{1}{\\prod_{\\ell=1}^d N_\\ell} \\sum_{\\mathbf{k}=\\mathbf{0}}^{\\mathbf{N}-1} e^{i 2\\pi \\mathbf{n} \\cdot (\\mathbf{k} / \\mathbf{N})} X_\\mathbf{k} \\, .</math>\n\nAs the one-dimensional DFT expresses the input <math>x_n</math> as a superposition of sinusoids, the multidimensional DFT expresses the input as a superposition of [[plane wave]]s, or multidimensional sinusoids. The direction of oscillation in space is <math>\\mathbf{k} / \\mathbf{N}</math>. The amplitudes  are <math>X_\\mathbf{k}</math>.  This decomposition is of great importance for everything from [[digital image processing]] (two-dimensional) to solving [[partial differential equations]]. The solution is broken up into plane waves.\n\nThe multidimensional DFT can be computed by the [[function composition|composition]] of a sequence of one-dimensional DFTs along each dimension.  In the two-dimensional case <math>x_{n_1,n_2}</math> the <math>N_1</math> independent DFTs of the rows (i.e., along <math>n_2</math>) are computed first to form a new array <math>y_{n_1,k_2}</math>. Then the <math>N_2</math> independent DFTs of ''y'' along the columns (along <math>n_1</math>) are computed to form the final result <math>X_{k_1,k_2}</math>.  Alternatively the columns can be computed first and then the rows. The order is immaterial because the nested summations above [[commutative operation|commute]].\n\nAn algorithm to compute a one-dimensional DFT is thus sufficient to efficiently compute a multidimensional DFT.  This approach is known as the ''row-column'' algorithm. There are also intrinsically [[Fast Fourier transform#Multidimensional FFTs|multidimensional FFT algorithms]].\n\n=== The real-input multidimensional DFT ===\nFor input data <math>x_{n_1, n_2, \\dots, n_d}</math> consisting of [[real numbers]], the DFT outputs have a conjugate symmetry similar to the one-dimensional case above:\n\n:<math>X_{k_1, k_2, \\dots, k_d} = X_{N_1 - k_1, N_2 - k_2, \\dots, N_d - k_d}^* ,</math>\n\nwhere the star again denotes complex conjugation and the <math>\\ell</math>-th subscript is again interpreted modulo <math>N_\\ell</math> (for <math>\\ell = 1,2,\\ldots,d</math>).\n\n== Applications ==\nThe DFT has seen wide usage across a large number of fields; we only sketch a few examples below (see also the references at the end). All applications of the DFT depend crucially on the availability of a fast algorithm to compute discrete Fourier transforms and their inverses, a [[fast Fourier transform]].\n\n=== Spectral analysis ===\nWhen the DFT is used for [[signal spectral analysis]], the <math>\\{x_n\\}\\,</math> sequence usually represents a finite set of uniformly spaced time-samples of some signal <math>x(t)\\,</math>, where <math>t</math> represents time.  The conversion from continuous time to samples (discrete-time) changes the underlying [[continuous Fourier transform|Fourier transform]] of <math>x(t)</math> into a [[discrete-time Fourier transform]] (DTFT), which generally entails a type of distortion called [[aliasing]].  Choice of an appropriate sample-rate (see ''[[Nyquist rate]]'') is the key to minimizing that distortion.  Similarly, the conversion from a very long (or infinite) sequence to a manageable size entails a type of distortion called ''[[Spectral leakage|leakage]]'', which is manifested as a loss of detail (a.k.a. resolution) in the DTFT.  Choice of an appropriate sub-sequence length is the primary key to minimizing that effect.  When the available data (and time to process it) is more than the amount needed to attain the desired frequency resolution, a standard technique is to perform multiple DFTs, for example to create a [[spectrogram]].  If the desired result is a power spectrum and noise or randomness is present in the data, averaging the magnitude components of the multiple DFTs is a useful procedure to reduce the [[variance]] of the spectrum (also called a [[periodogram]] in this context); two examples of such techniques are the [[Welch method]] and the [[Bartlett method]]; the general subject of estimating the power spectrum of a noisy signal is called [[spectral estimation]].\n\nA final source of distortion (or perhaps ''illusion'') is the DFT itself, because it is just a discrete sampling of the DTFT, which is a function of a continuous frequency domain.  That can be mitigated by increasing the resolution of the DFT.  That procedure is illustrated at {{slink|Discrete-time Fourier transform|Sampling the DTFT|nopage=y}}.\n*The procedure is sometimes referred to as ''zero-padding'', which is a particular implementation used in conjunction with the [[fast Fourier transform]] (FFT) algorithm.  The inefficiency of performing multiplications and additions with zero-valued \"samples\" is more than offset by the inherent efficiency of the FFT.\n*As already stated, leakage imposes a limit on the inherent resolution of the DTFT, so there is a practical limit to the benefit that can be obtained from a fine-grained DFT.\n\n=== Filter bank ===\nSee {{slink|Filter bank|FFT filter banks|nopage=y}} and {{slink|Discrete-time Fourier transform|Sampling the DTFT|nopage=y}}.\n\n===Data compression===\nThe field of digital signal processing relies heavily on operations in the frequency domain (i.e. on the Fourier transform). For example, several [[lossy]] image and sound compression methods employ the discrete Fourier transform: the signal is cut into short segments, each is transformed, and then the Fourier coefficients of high frequencies, which are assumed to be unnoticeable, are discarded. The decompressor computes the inverse transform based on this reduced number of Fourier coefficients. (Compression applications often use a specialized form of the DFT, the [[discrete cosine transform]] or sometimes the [[modified discrete cosine transform]].)\nSome relatively recent compression algorithms, however, use [[wavelet transform]]s, which give a more uniform compromise between time and frequency domain than obtained by chopping data into segments and transforming each segment.  In the case of [[JPEG2000]], this avoids the spurious image features that appear when images are highly compressed with the original [[JPEG]].\n\n===Partial differential equations===\nDiscrete Fourier transforms are often used to solve [[partial differential equations]], where again the DFT is used as an approximation for the [[Fourier series]] (which is recovered in the limit of infinite ''N''). The advantage of this approach is that it expands the signal in complex exponentials <math>e^{inx}</math>, which are eigenfunctions of differentiation: <math>{\\text{d} \\big( e^{inx} \\big) }/\\text{d}x = in e^{inx}</math>. Thus, in the Fourier representation, differentiation is simple\u2014we just multiply by <math>in</math>.  (However, the choice of <math>n</math> is not unique due to aliasing; for the method to be convergent, a choice similar to that in the [[Discrete Fourier transform#Trigonometric interpolation polynomial|trigonometric interpolation]] section above should be used.) A [[linear differential equation]] with constant coefficients is transformed into an easily solvable algebraic equation. One then uses the inverse DFT to transform the result back into the ordinary spatial representation. Such an approach is called a [[spectral method]].\n\n===Polynomial multiplication===\n\nSuppose we wish to compute the polynomial product ''c''(''x'') = ''a''(''x'') \u00b7 ''b''(''x'').  The ordinary product expression for the coefficients of ''c'' involves a linear (acyclic) convolution, where indices do not \"wrap around.\"  This can be rewritten as a cyclic convolution by taking the coefficient vectors for ''a''(''x'') and ''b''(''x'') with constant term first, then appending zeros so that the resultant coefficient vectors '''a''' and '''b''' have dimension ''d''&nbsp;>&nbsp;deg(''a''(''x''))&nbsp;+&nbsp;deg(''b''(''x'')).  Then,\n\n:<math>\\mathbf{c} = \\mathbf{a} * \\mathbf{b}</math>\n\nWhere '''c''' is the vector of coefficients for ''c''(''x''), and the convolution operator <math>*\\,</math> is defined so\n\n:<math>c_n = \\sum_{m=0}^{d-1}a_m b_{n-m\\ \\mathrm{mod}\\ d} \\qquad\\qquad\\qquad n=0,1\\dots,d-1</math>\n\nBut convolution becomes multiplication under the DFT:\n\n:<math>\\mathcal{F}(\\mathbf{c}) = \\mathcal{F}(\\mathbf{a})\\mathcal{F}(\\mathbf{b})</math>\n\nHere the vector product is taken elementwise.  Thus the coefficients of the product polynomial ''c''(''x'') are just the terms 0, ..., deg(''a''(''x'')) + deg(''b''(''x'')) of the coefficient vector\n\n:<math>\\mathbf{c} = \\mathcal{F}^{-1}(\\mathcal{F}(\\mathbf{a})\\mathcal{F}(\\mathbf{b})).</math>\n\nWith a [[fast Fourier transform]], the resulting algorithm takes O (''N''&nbsp;log&nbsp;''N'') arithmetic operations.  Due to its simplicity and speed, the [[Cooley\u2013Tukey FFT algorithm]], which is limited to [[composite number|composite]] sizes, is often chosen for the transform operation.  In this case, ''d'' should be chosen as the smallest integer greater than the sum of the input polynomial degrees that is factorizable into small prime factors (e.g. 2, 3, and 5, depending upon the FFT implementation).\n\n====Multiplication of large integers====\n\nThe fastest known [[multiplication algorithms|algorithms]] for the multiplication of very large [[integer]]s use the polynomial multiplication method outlined above.  Integers can be treated as the value of a polynomial evaluated specifically at the number base, with the coefficients of the polynomial corresponding to the digits in that base (ex. <math>123 = 1 \\cdot 10^2 + 2 \\cdot 10^1 + 3 \\cdot 10^0</math>).  After polynomial multiplication, a relatively low-complexity carry-propagation step completes the multiplication.\n\n==== Convolution  ====\nWhen data is [[Convolution|convolved]] with a function with wide support, such as for downsampling by a large sampling ratio, because of the [[Convolution theorem]] and the FFT algorithm, it may be faster to transform it, multiply pointwise by the transform of the filter and then reverse transform it.  Alternatively, a good filter is obtained by simply truncating the transformed data and re-transforming the shortened data set.\n\n==Some discrete Fourier transform pairs==\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n|+ '''Some DFT pairs'''\n|-\n! <math>x_n = \\frac{1}{N}\\sum_{k=0}^{N-1}X_k  e^{i 2 \\pi kn/N} </math>\n! <math>X_k = \\sum_{n=0}^{N-1}x_n  e^{-i 2 \\pi kn/N} </math>\n!

In other words, a sequence of <math>n</math> complex numbers can be thought of as an element of <math>n</math>-dimensional complex space <math>\\mathbb{C}^n</math> or equivalently a function <math>f</math> from the finite cyclic group of order <math>n</math> to the complex numbers, <math>\\mathbb{Z}_n \\mapsto \\mathbb{C}</math>. So  <math>f</math> is a [[class function]] on the finite cyclic group, and thus can be expressed as a linear combination of the irreducible characters of this group, which are the roots of unity.\n\nFrom this point of view, one may generalize the DFT to representation theory generally, or more narrowly to the [[representation theory of finite groups]].\n\nMore narrowly still, one may generalize the DFT by either changing the target (taking values in a field other than the complex numbers), or the domain (a group other than a finite cyclic group), as detailed in the sequel.\n\n=== Other fields ===\n{{Main|Discrete Fourier transform (general)|Number-theoretic transform}}\nMany of the properties of the DFT only depend on the fact that <math>e^{-\\frac{i 2 \\pi}{N}}</math> is a [[primitive root of unity]], sometimes denoted <math>\\omega_N</math> or <math>W_N</math> (so that <math>\\omega_N^N = 1</math>).  Such properties include the completeness, orthogonality, Plancherel/Parseval, periodicity, shift, convolution, and unitarity properties above, as well as many FFT algorithms. For this reason, the discrete Fourier transform can be defined by using roots of unity in [[field (mathematics)|fields]] other than the complex numbers, and such generalizations are commonly called ''number-theoretic transforms'' (NTTs) in the case of [[finite field]]s. For more information, see [[number-theoretic transform]] and [[discrete Fourier transform (general)]].\n\n=== Other finite groups ===\n{{Main|Fourier transform on finite groups}}\nThe standard DFT acts on a sequence ''x''<sub>0</sub>, ''x''<sub>1</sub>, ..., ''x''<sub>''N''&minus;1</sub> of complex numbers, which can be viewed as a function {0, 1, ..., ''N'' &minus; 1} \u2192 '''C'''. The multidimensional DFT acts on multidimensional sequences, which can be viewed as functions\n:<math> \\{0, 1, \\ldots, N_1-1\\} \\times \\cdots \\times \\{0, 1, \\ldots, N_d-1\\} \\to \\mathbb{C}. </math>\nThis suggests the generalization to [[Fourier transform on finite groups|Fourier transforms on arbitrary finite groups]], which act on functions ''G'' \u2192 '''C''' where ''G'' is a [[finite group]]. In this framework, the standard DFT is seen as the Fourier transform on a [[cyclic group]], while the multidimensional DFT is a Fourier transform on a direct sum of cyclic groups.\n\nFurther, Fourier transform can be on cosets of a group.\n\n==Alternatives==\n{{Main|Discrete wavelet transform}}\n{{details|Discrete wavelet transform#Comparison with Fourier transform}} There are various alternatives to the DFT for various applications, prominent among which are [[wavelets]]. The analog of the DFT is the [[discrete wavelet transform]] (DWT). From the point of view of [[time\u2013frequency analysis]], a key limitation of the Fourier transform is that it does not include ''location'' information, only ''frequency'' information, and thus has difficulty in representing transients. As wavelets have location as well as frequency, they are better able to represent location, at the expense of greater difficulty representing frequency. For details, see [[Discrete wavelet transform#Comparison with Fourier transform|comparison of the discrete wavelet transform with the discrete Fourier transform]].\n\n==See also==\n*[[Companion matrix]]\n*[[DFT matrix]]\n*[[Fast Fourier transform]]\n*[[FFTPACK]]\n*[[FFTW]]\n*[[Generalizations of Pauli matrices]]\n*[[List of Fourier-related transforms]]\n*[[Multidimensional transform]]\n*[[Zak transform]]\n*[[Quantum Fourier transform]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{notelist-ua}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|32em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n{{More footnotes|date=January 2009}}\n* {{cite book\n | last = Brigham | first = E.

{"title_page": "Underwriting", "text_new": "{{Short description|Financial practice supporting a contract's value}}{{Redirect|Underwriter|the United States Navy ships|USS Underwriter}} \n{{Refimprove|date=November 2009}}\n'''Underwriting''' services are provided by some large  [[financial institution]]s, such as banks, or insurance or investment houses, whereby they guarantee payment in case of damage or financial loss and accept the [[financial risk]] for liability arising from such guarantee. An underwriting arrangement may be created in a number of situations including insurance, issues of security in a [[public offering]], and bank lending, among others. The person or institution that agrees to sell a minimum number of securities of the company for commission is called the Underwriter.\n\nThe name derives from the [[Lloyd's of London]] [[insurance]] market. Financial bankers, who would accept some of the risk on a given venture (historically a sea voyage with associated risks of shipwreck) in exchange for a [[insurance premium|premium]], would literally write their names under the risk information that was written on a Lloyd's slip created for this purpose.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=ZCu4ctqn9OsC&pg=PA25 \"Underwriting: The Poetics of Insurance in America, 1722-1872\"] , by Eric Wertheimer, Stanford University Press, 2006</ref>\n\n==Securities underwriting==\n[[Security (finance)|Securities]] underwriting is the process by which [[investment banking|investment banks]] raise investment capital from investors on behalf of corporations and governments that are issuing securities (both [[ownership equity|equity]] and [[debt capital]]). The services of an underwriter are typically used as part of a [[public offering]] in a [[primary market]].\n\nThis is a way of distributing a newly issued security, such as stocks or bonds, to investors. A [[syndicate]] of banks (the lead managers) underwrites the transaction, which means they have taken on the risk of distributing the securities. Should they not be able to find enough investors, they will have to hold some securities themselves. Underwriters make their income from the price difference (the \"[[underwriting spread]]\") between the price they pay the issuer and what they collect from investors or from broker-dealers who buy portions of the offering.\n\n===Risk, exclusivity, and reward===\nOnce the underwriting agreement is struck, the underwriter bears the risk of being unable to sell the underlying securities, and the cost of holding them on its books until such time in the future that they may be favorably sold.\n\nIf the instrument is desirable, the underwriter and the securities issuer may choose to enter into an exclusivity agreement. In exchange for a higher price paid upfront to the issuer, or other favorable terms, the issuer may agree to make the underwriter the exclusive agent for the initial sale of the securities instrument. That is, even though third-party buyers might approach the issuer directly to buy, the issuer agrees to sell exclusively through the underwriter.\n\nIn summary, the securities issuer gets cash up front, access to the contacts and sales channels of the underwriter, and is insulated from the market risk of being unable to sell the securities at a good price. The underwriter gets a profit from the markup, plus the possibility of an exclusive sales agreement.\n\nAlso if the securities are priced significantly below market price (as is often the custom), the underwriter also curries favor with powerful end customers by granting them an immediate profit (see [[flipping]]), perhaps in a [[quid pro quo]]. This practice, which is typically justified as the reward for the underwriter for taking on the market risk, is occasionally criticized as unethical, such as the allegations that [[Frank Quattrone]] acted improperly in doling out hot [[initial public offering|IPO]] stock during the [[dot com bubble]].\n\n==Bank underwriting==\nIn [[banking]], underwriting is the detailed [[Credit (finance)|credit]] analysis preceding the granting of a [[loan]], based on credit information furnished by the borrower; such underwriting falls into several areas:\n\n*Consumer loan underwriting includes the verification of such items as employment history, salary and [[financial statements]]; publicly available information, such as the borrower's credit history, which is detailed in a [[credit report]]; and the lender's evaluation of the borrower's credit needs and ability to pay. Examples include [[mortgage underwriting]].\n*Commercial (or business) underwriting consists of the evaluation of financial information provided by small businesses including analysis of the business balance sheet including tangible net worth, the ratio of debt to worth (leverage) and available liquidity (current ratio).  Analysis of the income statement typically includes revenue trends, gross margin, profitability, and [[Debt Service Coverage Ratio|debt service coverage]].\n\nUnderwriting can also refer to the purchase of [[corporate bond]]s, [[commercial paper]], government securities, municipal general-obligation bonds by a [[commercial bank]] or dealer bank for its own [[Deposit account|account]] or for resale to investors. Bank underwriting of corporate securities is carried out through separate holding-company affiliates, called [[securities affiliate]]s or Section 20 affiliates.\n\nOf late, the discourse on underwriting has been dominated by the advent of [[machine learning]] in this space. These profound technological innovations are altering the way traditional underwriting scorecards have been built, and are displacing human underwriters with automation. [[Natural language understanding]] allows the consideration of more sources of information to assess risk than used previously.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.businessnewsdaily.com/10203-artificial-intelligence-insurance-industry.html|author=Adam C. Uzialko|title=Artificial Insurance? How Machine Learning is Transforming Underwriting|date=September 11, 2017|access-date=April 28, 2019|publisher=Business News Daily}}</ref> These algorithms typically use modern data sources such as SMS / Email for banking information, location data to verify addresses, and so on. Several firms are trying to build models that can gauge a customer's willingness to pay using social media data by applying natural language understanding algorithms which essentially try to analyse and quantify a person's popularity / likability and so on, with the premise being that people scoring high on these parameters are less likely to default on a loan. However, this area is still vastly subjective.\n\n==Insurance underwriting==\n[[Insurance]] underwriters evaluate the risk and exposures of potential clients. They decide how much coverage the client should receive, how much they should pay for it, or whether even to accept the risk and insure them. Underwriting involves measuring risk exposure and determining the [[insurance premium|premium]] that needs to be charged to insure that risk. The function of the underwriter is to protect the company's [[book of business]] from risks that they feel will make a loss and issue [[Insurance contract|insurance policies]] at a premium that is commensurate with the exposure presented by a risk.\n\nEach insurance company has its own set of underwriting guidelines to help the underwriter determine whether or not the company should accept the risk. The information used to evaluate the risk of an applicant for insurance will depend on the type of coverage involved. For example, in underwriting automobile coverage, an individual's driving record is critical. However, the type of automobile is actually far more critical. As part of the underwriting process for [[life insurance|life]] or [[health insurance]], [[medical underwriting]] may be used to examine the applicant's health status (other factors may be considered as well, such as age & occupation). The factors that insurers use to classify risks are generally objective, clearly related to the likely cost of providing coverage, practical to administer, consistent with applicable law, and designed to protect the long-term viability of the insurance program.<ref>[http://www.actuarialstandardsboard.org/pdf/asops/asop012_101.pdf \"Risk Classification (for All Practice Areas),\"] Actuarial Standard of '''Practice No. 12''', Actuarial Standards Board, December 2005</ref>\n\nThe underwriters may decline the risk, or may provide a quotation in which the premiums have been [[premium loadings|loaded]] (including the amount needed to generate a profit, in addition to covering expenses<ref>{{cite web|url=http://thelawdictionary.org/premium-loading/|title=What is PREMIUM LOADING? definition of PREMIUM LOADING (Black's Law Dictionary)|date=19 October 2012|publisher=}}</ref>) or in which various [[exclusions (insurance)|exclusions]] have been stipulated, which restrict the circumstances under which a claim would be paid. Depending on the type of insurance product (line of business), insurance companies use automated underwriting systems to encode these rules, and reduce the amount of manual work in processing quotations and policy issuance. This is especially the case for certain simpler life or personal lines (auto, homeowners) insurance. Some insurance companies, however, rely on agents to underwrite for them. This arrangement allows an insurer to operate in a market closer to its clients without having to establish a physical presence.\n\nTwo major categories of exclusion in insurance underwriting are [[moral hazard]] and [[correlated]] losses.<ref name=\"npr\">{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/blogs/money/2014/10/03/353030214/bedbugs-lava-and-bowling-balls-inside-my-homeowners-insurance-policy|title=Bedbugs, Lava And Bowling Balls: Inside My Homeowners Insurance Policy|publisher=}}</ref>  With a moral hazard, the consequences of the customer's actions are insured, making the customer more likely to take costly actions.

An underwriting arrangement may be created in a number of situations including insurance, issues of security in a [[public offering]], and bank lending, among others. The person or institution that agrees to sell a minimum number of securities of the company for commission is called the Underwriter.\n\nThe name derives from the [[Lloyd's of London]] [[insurance]] market. Financial bankers, who would accept some of the risk on a given venture (historically a sea voyage with associated risks of shipwreck) in exchange for a [[insurance premium|premium]], would literally write their names under the risk information that was written on a Lloyd's slip created for this purpose.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=ZCu4ctqn9OsC&pg=PA25 \"Underwriting: The Poetics of Insurance in America, 1722-1872\"] , by Eric Wertheimer, Stanford University Press, 2006</ref>\n\n==Securities underwriting==\n[[Security (finance)|Securities]] underwriting is the process by which [[investment banking|investment banks]] raise investment capital from investors on behalf of corporations and governments that are issuing securities (both [[ownership equity|equity]] and [[debt capital]]). The services of an underwriter are typically used as part of a [[public offering]] in a [[primary market]].\n\nThis is a way of distributing a newly issued security, such as stocks or bonds, to investors. A [[syndicate]] of banks (the lead managers) underwrites the transaction, which means they have taken on the risk of distributing the securities. Should they not be able to find enough investors, they will have to hold some securities themselves. Underwriters make their income from the price difference (the \"[[underwriting spread]]\") between the price they pay the issuer and what they collect from investors or from broker-dealers who buy portions of the offering.\n\n===Risk, exclusivity, and reward===\nOnce the underwriting agreement is struck, the underwriter bears the risk of being unable to sell the underlying securities, and the cost of holding them on its books until such time in the future that they may be favorably sold.\n\nIf the instrument is desirable, the underwriter and the securities issuer may choose to enter into an exclusivity agreement. In exchange for a higher price paid upfront to the issuer, or other favorable terms, the issuer may agree to make the underwriter the exclusive agent for the initial sale of the securities instrument. That is, even though third-party buyers might approach the issuer directly to buy, the issuer agrees to sell exclusively through the underwriter.\n\nIn summary, the securities issuer gets cash up front, access to the contacts and sales channels of the underwriter, and is insulated from the market risk of being unable to sell the securities at a good price. The underwriter gets a profit from the markup, plus the possibility of an exclusive sales agreement.\n\nAlso if the securities are priced significantly below market price (as is often the custom), the underwriter also curries favor with powerful end customers by granting them an immediate profit (see [[flipping]]), perhaps in a [[quid pro quo]]. This practice, which is typically justified as the reward for the underwriter for taking on the market risk, is occasionally criticized as unethical, such as the allegations that [[Frank Quattrone]] acted improperly in doling out hot [[initial public offering|IPO]] stock during the [[dot com bubble]].\n\n==Bank underwriting==\nIn [[banking]], underwriting is the detailed [[Credit (finance)|credit]] analysis preceding the granting of a [[loan]], based on credit information furnished by the borrower; such underwriting falls into several areas:\n\n*Consumer loan underwriting includes the verification of such items as employment history, salary and [[financial statements]]; publicly available information, such as the borrower's credit history, which is detailed in a [[credit report]]; and the lender's evaluation of the borrower's credit needs and ability to pay. Examples include [[mortgage underwriting]].\n*Commercial (or business) underwriting consists of the evaluation of financial information provided by small businesses including analysis of the business balance sheet including tangible net worth, the ratio of debt to worth (leverage) and available liquidity (current ratio).  Analysis of the income statement typically includes revenue trends, gross margin, profitability, and [[Debt Service Coverage Ratio|debt service coverage]].\n\nUnderwriting can also refer to the purchase of [[corporate bond]]s, [[commercial paper]], government securities, municipal general-obligation bonds by a [[commercial bank]] or dealer bank for its own [[Deposit account|account]] or for resale to investors. Bank underwriting of corporate securities is carried out through separate holding-company affiliates, called [[securities affiliate]]s or Section 20 affiliates.\n\nOf late, the discourse on underwriting has been dominated by the advent of [[machine learning]] in this space. These profound technological innovations are altering the way traditional underwriting scorecards have been built, and are displacing human underwriters with automation. [[Natural language understanding]] allows the consideration of more sources of information to assess risk than used previously.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.businessnewsdaily.com/10203-artificial-intelligence-insurance-industry.html|author=Adam C. Uzialko|title=Artificial Insurance? How Machine Learning is Transforming Underwriting|date=September 11, 2017|access-date=April 28, 2019|publisher=Business News Daily}}</ref> These algorithms typically use modern data sources such as SMS / Email for banking information, location data to verify addresses, and so on. Several firms are trying to build models that can gauge a customer's willingness to pay using social media data by applying natural language understanding algorithms which essentially try to analyse and quantify a person's popularity / likability and so on, with the premise being that people scoring high on these parameters are less likely to default on a loan. However, this area is still vastly subjective.\n\n==Insurance underwriting==\n[[Insurance]] underwriters evaluate the risk and exposures of potential clients. They decide how much coverage the client should receive, how much they should pay for it, or whether even to accept the risk and insure them. Underwriting involves measuring risk exposure and determining the [[insurance premium|premium]] that needs to be charged to insure that risk. The function of the underwriter is to protect the company's [[book of business]] from risks that they feel will make a loss and issue [[Insurance contract|insurance policies]] at a premium that is commensurate with the exposure presented by a risk.\n\nEach insurance company has its own set of underwriting guidelines to help the underwriter determine whether or not the company should accept the risk. The information used to evaluate the risk of an applicant for insurance will depend on the type of coverage involved. For example, in underwriting automobile coverage, an individual's driving record is critical. However, the type of automobile is actually far more critical. As part of the underwriting process for [[life insurance|life]] or [[health insurance]], [[medical underwriting]] may be used to examine the applicant's health status (other factors may be considered as well, such as age & occupation). The factors that insurers use to classify risks are generally objective, clearly related to the likely cost of providing coverage, practical to administer, consistent with applicable law, and designed to protect the long-term viability of the insurance program.<ref>[http://www.actuarialstandardsboard.org/pdf/asops/asop012_101.pdf \"Risk Classification (for All Practice Areas),\"] Actuarial Standard of '''Practice No. 12''', Actuarial Standards Board, December 2005</ref>\n\nThe underwriters may decline the risk or may provide a quotation in which the premiums have been [[premium loadings|loaded]] (including the amount needed to generate a profit, in addition to covering expenses<ref>{{cite web|url=http://thelawdictionary.org/premium-loading/|title=What is PREMIUM LOADING? definition of PREMIUM LOADING (Black's Law Dictionary)|date=19 October 2012|publisher=}}</ref>) or in which various [[exclusions (insurance)|exclusions]] have been stipulated, which restrict the circumstances under which a claim would be paid. Depending on the type of insurance product (line of business), insurance companies use automated underwriting systems to encode these rules, and reduce the amount of manual work in processing quotations and policy issuance. This is especially the case for certain simpler life or personal lines (auto, homeowners) insurance. Some insurance companies, however, rely on agents to underwrite for them. This arrangement allows an insurer to operate in a market closer to its clients without having to establish a physical presence.\n\nTwo major categories of exclusion in insurance underwriting are [[moral hazard]] and [[correlated]] losses.<ref name=\"npr\">{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/blogs/money/2014/10/03/353030214/bedbugs-lava-and-bowling-balls-inside-my-homeowners-insurance-policy|title=Bedbugs, Lava And Bowling Balls: Inside My Homeowners Insurance Policy|publisher=}}</ref>  With a moral hazard, the consequences of the customer's actions are insured, making the customer more likely to take costly actions.

The blast seriously injured 21-year-old  [[Constable|Police Constable]] Angela Taylor, who died on 20 April, becoming the first Australian policewoman to be killed in the line of duty.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2006/03/24/1143083990293.html|title=Remembering the day Russell Street shook|work=The Age|date=25 March 2006|accessdate=12 March 2008}}</ref><ref>[http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-03-24/scars-still-felt-20-years-after-russell-street-bombing/7264058 Scars still felt 30 years after Russell Street bombing], [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]], 24 March 2016</ref> 22 other people were injured.\n{{clear left}}\n\n==Investigations==\nOn 7 October 1985, [[gelignite]] and [[detonator]]s were stolen from the Tyrconnel Mine at Blackwood.

Under police questioning, Crupi denied that he had any involvement in the bombing but admitted that he had a hatred towards a detective who worked at Russell Street. Crupi also stated that the homemade device recovered in his home was a fake and was meant to planted at a police station in [[Flemington, Victoria |Flemington]].\n\nA major breakthrough in the investigation came from a police report filed three weeks prior to the bombing. On 6 March 1986, a Victoria  Police Traffic unit was in pursuit of a stolen red [[Daimler Sovereign]] in [[East Keilor, Victoria |East Keilor]], the pursuit came to the end when the driver wrecked the Daimler. The driver fled on foot into nearby [[St. Albans, Victoria |St. Albans]] where he had stolen another car from a passing motorist at gunpoint and made his escape. In the boot of the Daimler, police found a backpack, containing a set of [[Vehicle registration plates of Victoria |Victorian number plates]] that had been cut into pieces. When the pieces were put back together, the number plates; CCH-997, came back to a silver [[Holden Commodore (VK)#SS Group A |VK Commodore HDT]] that had also been stolen before the bombing. This second Commodore matched the description of a vehicle being used in a armed robbery of a bank in[[Donvale, Victoria | Donvale]] hours after the bombing in which the Commodore was used to crash into the front window of the bank. The vehicle was later recovered from the [[Yarra River]] at[[Wonga Park, Victoria | Wonga Park]] on 7 April 1986. \n\nUpon the examination of the silver Commodore by the Victoria Police Stolen Motor Vehicles Squad, detectives discovered that the vehicle's [[Vehicle identification number |VIN]] on the chassis had been drilled out. The drill marks on the silver Commodore's VIN were found to be identical to the VIN on the Commodore used in the bombing and the silver Commodore's number plates were recovered from the Daimler, linking the stolen Daimler and the Donvale robbery to the Russell Street Bombing.  \n\nIn a statement given to the detectives, the traffic officer caught a glimpse of the driver from the Daimler during the chase and out of a series of mugshots, identified the driver as Peter Reed (born Peter Komiazyk). Reed was a suspected armed robber and car thief.<ref>''The Russell Street Bombing''</ref> As Reed was a person of interest in matters relating to several violent armed robberies and car thefts, his address and the addresses of Reed's family members and several of his associates were placed under police surveillance.\n\n==Arrests==\nOn 25 April 1986, ten [[Victoria Police]] officers raided the [[Kallista, Victoria|Kallista]] home of Peter Michael Reed at 5:45 a.m. It was alleged that upon attempting to enforce the arrest by forcing entry to the premises, Reed produced a [[.455]] [[Smith & Wesson]] [[revolver]] and fired at police, seriously wounding Detective Sergeant Mark Wylie. Reed was then fired upon by Det. Sgt. Steve Quinsee, who was also wounded and arrested.\n\nDuring the search of Reed's home, detectives found several firearms with drill marks similar to the drill marks on both the bomb car and the stolen silver Commodore. Also recovered at Reed's home was a police scanner and two detonators sitting on a backpack identical to the detonators used in the bombing. Inside of the backpack were sticks of gelignite identical to the sticks of gelignite used in the bomb car.\n\nFingerprints found on the door of the toilet at Reed's home matched to Craig Minogue and fingerprints found on the newspaper wrapped around the sticks of gelignite matched to Craig Minogue's brother; Rodney Minogue. The Minogue brothers were both associates of Reed in which Rodney Minogue had served time in prison with Reed. \n\nPolice later raided Zelinka's house, evidence recovered from the house matched as the source of the components used in the construction of the bomb including a fence post from a neighbouring yard that matched a block of wood found at the Russell Street scene and a metal rubbish bin that matched a metal strip used to hold the wired components of the bomb in place. Under police questioning, Zelinka (who had no criminal record) admitted that he saw Craig Minogue drive a Commodore identical to the one used in the bombing into the garage of the Zelinka's home. Zelinka also stated that Craig Minogue had paid for Zelinka and his girlfriend to travel to Sydney for the Easter Holiday just before the bombing occurred with the return airline ticket dated for after the bombing. Zelinka then stated the when he and his girlfriend returned from Sydney after the bombing, he saw the Minogue brothers filling up a small trailer and was told by Craig Minogue that he and his brother were moving out from Zelinka's home.\n\nZelinka then told the detectives that while the Minogue brothers were staying at his home, they were visited multiple on several occasions before the bombing by an associate known to Craig Minogue. Zelinka described the associate as a older male aged about 50 and was referred to as \"Stan the Man\", Zelinka's description of \"Stan the Man\" matched to armed robber; Stanley Brian Taylor. Stan Taylor had a extensive criminal record dating back to 1946 when at the age of 8, he was arrested for truancy and sent to Bayswater Boys Home at [[The Basin, Victoria | The Basin]] for two years. In 1949, he was arrested for fishing in prohibited area. During his young adult years, Taylor had been convicted of theft of motorcycles and burglary. In the early 1960s, Taylor was convicted of a armed robbery on a [[Milk bar | milk bar]] in [[Clayton, Victoria | Clayton]] and was sent to [[HM Prison Pentridge | Pentridge's]] notorious H Division where met [[Ronald Ryan]]; the last man hanged in Australia. Ryan had asked Taylor to accompanied him on his escape but Taylor refused. Instead, Taylor and another prisoner escaped from Pentridge, while on the run, Taylor committed seven bank robberies over a period of five days before being recaptured and sent back to prison.      \n\nWhile in prison, Taylor became a model prisoner and was released in 1978. After his release, Taylor became a social worker to help young men avoid a life of crime. Taylor was also a bit actor, in 1979, he starred in an episode of [[Prisoner (TV series) | Prisoner]].<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://www.theage.com.au/national/victoria/russell-street-bomber-the-dying-embers-of-hate-20150611-ghlatl.html|title=Russell Street Bomber: the dying embers of hate|last=Silvester|first=John|date=2015-06-11|work=The Age|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\nDetectives arrested Taylor at his home in [[Birchip, Victoria | Birchip]] on the 30 May 1986. Under questioning, Taylor claimed that he had no involvement in the bombing and that knew Craig and Rodney Minogue through his job as a social worker and he met them to prevent them from getting involved in any crime, but admitted that both Craig and Rodney Minogue and Peter Reed were responsible for the Russell Street Bombing.\n\nDetectives then ran a search for Craig and Rodney Minogue and found that they moved into a house within close distance of Taylor's home in Birchip, a raid on the house failed to locate the Minogue Brother but turned up evidence linking them to Russell Street Bombing. At the house, detectives recovered an large drill machine that matched to the drill marks on both the stolen silver Commodore and on the bomb car.\n\n==Trial==\nReed was charged with attempted murder, recklessly causing serious injury, using a firearm to prevent apprehension and possessing explosives in suspicious circumstances in addition to charges related to the Russell Street bombing. Reed later reportedly stated at his trial in unsworn evidence that ''\"the police started the shooting and I only used [my] firearm in self defence.\"''\n\nProsecutors did not allege that any person played any particular role in the bombing, but that each of them were members of a team which planned the bombing and caused the bomb to explode. Evidence against the accused was as follows:\n* Gelignite and detonators used in the construction of the bomb were of the same type as those stolen from a mine.\n* Gelignite was found at Reed's house wrapped in newspaper containing fingerprints belonging to Rodney Minogue.\n* Craig Minogue owned a pair of side cutters which produced cuts similar to those found on detonator wires.\n* a file with traces of brass deposits matched with brass deposits found at the bomb site.\n* a block of wood from which a wooden part of the bomb had been sawn was found at Craig Minogue's premises.\n* tinned copper wire, similar to that used with detonators found at the bomb site, was found at Craig Minogue's premises.\n* residue of gelignite matched residue found at a previous address of Craig Minogue in Lower [[Templestowe]].\n* evidence from a witness that Craig Minogue called around Easter 1986, to ask about the use of detonators.\n* a witness testified that Craig Minogue was seen driving a 1979 Commodore around the CBD prior to the explosion.\n* another witness testified that before the bombing, that they discovered a box of explosives at a house they shared with the Minogue Brothers and was told by Craig Minogue to \"forget what they seen\".\n\nAt the end of a six month trial in the Supreme Court of Victoria in 1988 before Justice Vincent, Taylor and Craig Minogue were convicted of murder and various other offences related to the bombing. Peter Reed and Rodney Minogue were acquitted of any offences related to the bombing but Reed was convicted of a number of offences related to his arrest, and was sentenced to 12 years imprisonment.\n\nTaylor was sentenced to life imprisonment with no minimum term (i.e. never to be released), the first person in Victoria to be so sentenced. Taylor died in prison at the age of 79.[https://www.news.com.au/national/victoria/news/stanley-taylor-died-from-natural-causes-while-in-custody/news-story/fb57c49ed0d9e69c35c3a933bf5af30a] Craig Minogue was sentenced to life imprisonment with a minimum term of 28 years.

Evidence against the accused was as follows:\n* Gelignite and detonators used in the construction of the bomb were of the same type as those stolen from a mine.\n* Gelignite was found at Reed's house wrapped in newspaper containing fingerprints belonging to Rodney Minogue.\n* Craig Minogue owned a pair of side cutters which produced cuts similar to those found on detonator wires.\n* a file with traces of brass deposits matched with brass deposits found at the bomb site.\n* a block of wood from which a wooden part of the bomb had been sawn was found at Craig Minogue's premises.\n* tinned copper wire, similar to that used with detonators found at the bomb site, was found at Craig Minogue's premises.\n* residue of gelignite matched residue found at a previous address of Craig Minogue in Lower [[Templestowe]].\n* evidence from a witness that Craig Minogue called around Easter 1986, to ask about the use of detonators.\n* a witness testified that Craig Minogue was seen driving a 1979 Commodore around the CBD prior to the explosion.\n* another witness testified that before the bombing, that they discovered a box of explosives at a house they shared with the Minogue Brothers and was told by Craig Minogue to \"forget what they seen\".\n\nAt the end of a six month trial in the Supreme Court of Victoria in 1988 before Justice Vincent, Taylor and Craig Minogue were convicted of murder and various other offences related to the bombing. Peter Reed and Rodney Minogue were acquitted of any offences related to the bombing but Reed was convicted of a number of offences related to his arrest, and was sentenced to 12 years imprisonment.\n\nTaylor was sentenced to life imprisonment with no minimum term (i.e. never to be released), the first person in Victoria to be so sentenced. Taylor died in prison at the age of 79.[https://www.news.com.au/national/victoria/news/stanley-taylor-died-from-natural-causes-while-in-custody/news-story/fb57c49ed0d9e69c35c3a933bf5af30a] Craig Minogue was sentenced to life imprisonment with a minimum term of 28 years.

Another important use of amaranth throughout [[Mesoamerica]] was in ritual drinks and foods. To this day, [[amaranth grain]]s are toasted much like popcorn and mixed with [[honey]], [[molasses]], or [[chocolate]] to make a treat called {{lang|es|alegr\u00eda}}, meaning \"joy\" in Spanish. [[Diego Dur\u00e1n]] described the festivities for the Aztec god {{lang|nci|[[Huitzilopochtli]]|italic=no}} (whose name means \"left side of the hummingbird\"; hummingbirds feed on amaranth flowers). The Aztec month of {{lang|nci|[[Aztec calendar|Panquetzaliztli]]|italic=no}} (7 December to 26 December) was dedicated to {{lang|nci|Huitzilopochtli|italic=no}}. People decorated their homes and trees with paper flags; ritual races, processions, dances, songs, prayers, and finally [[human sacrifice]]s were held. This was one of the more important Aztec festivals, and the people prepared for the whole month. They fasted or ate very little; a statue of the god was made out of amaranth seeds and honey, and at the end of the month, it was cut into small pieces so everybody could eat a piece of the god. After the Spanish conquest, cultivation of amaranth was outlawed, while some of the festivities were subsumed into the Christmas celebration.\n\nAmaranth is native to the New World and has been first found in the Old World as part of an archaeological excavation in Narhan, India, dated to 1000-800 B.C.E.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Saraswat |first1=K.S. |last2=Sharma |first2=N.K. |last3=Saini |first3=D.C. |title=Plant Economy at Ancient Narhan (ca. 1300 B.C.-300/400 A.D.) in Excavations at Narhan (1984-1989), Appendix IV |date=1994 |publisher=Department of Ancient Indian History, Culture and Archaeology, Banaras Hindu University |location=Varanasi, Uttar Pradesh, India |pages=225\u2013337}}</ref>{{dubious|date=February 2020}}\n\nBecause of its importance as a symbol of indigenous culture, its palatability, ease of cooking, and a protein that is particularly well-suited to human nutritional needs, interest in amaranth seeds (especially ''A. cruentus'' and ''A. hypochondriacus'') revived in the 1970s. It was recovered in Mexico from wild varieties and is now commercially cultivated.

To determine palatability, different levels of amaranth grain flour were mixed with the wheat flour and baking ingredients (1% salt, 2.5% fat, 1.5% yeast, 10% sugar, and 52\u201374% water), fermented, molded, pan-proofed, and baked. The baked products were evaluated for loaf volume, moisture content, color, odor, taste, and texture. The amaranth-containing products were then compared with bread made from 100% wheat flour. The loaf volume decreased by 40% and the moisture content increased from 22 to 42% with increase in amaranth grain flour. The study found that the sensory scores of the taste, odor, color, and texture decreased with increasing amounts of amaranth. Generally, above 15% amaranth grain flour, significant differences occurred in the evaluated sensory qualities and the high amaranth-containing product was found to be of unacceptable palatability to the population sample that evaluated the baked products.<ref>{{cite journal|title=The effect of amaranth grain flour on the quality of bread|author=Jerome Ayo|doi=10.1081/JFP-100105198|journal=International Journal of Food Properties|year=2001|volume=4|issue=2|pages=341|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1081/JFP-100105198}}</ref>\n -->\n\n=== Leaves, roots, and stems ===\nAmaranth species are cultivated and consumed as a [[leaf vegetable]] in many parts of the world.

In the Philippines, the [[Ilocano language|Ilocano]] word for the plant is {{lang|ilo|kalunay}}; the [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]] word for the plant is {{lang|tg|kilitis}} or {{lang|tg|kulitis}}. In [[Uttar Pradesh]] and [[Bihar]]punjab  in India, it is called ''chaulai''\u0a1a\u0a4b\u0a32\u0a3e\u0a08  and is a popular green leafy vegetable (referred to in the class of vegetable preparations called \u0a38\u0a3e\u0a17 ''[[saag]]''). It is called ''chua'' in Kumaun area of Uttarakhand, where it is a popular red-green vegetable. In Karnataka in India, it is called ''harive''. It is used to prepare curries such as ''hulee, palya, majjigay-hulee'', and so on. In Kerala, it is called ''cheera'' and is consumed by stir-frying the leaves with spices and red chili peppers to make a dish called ''cheera [[thoran]]''. In Tamil Nadu, it is called ''mulaikkira'' and is regularly consumed as a favourite dish, where the greens are steamed and mashed with light seasoning of salt, red chili pepper, and cumin.

Another important use of amaranth throughout [[Mesoamerica]] was in ritual drinks and foods. To this day, [[amaranth grain]]s are toasted much like popcorn and mixed with [[honey]], [[molasses]], or [[chocolate]] to make a treat called {{lang|es|alegr\u00eda}}, meaning \"joy\" in Spanish. [[Diego Dur\u00e1n]] described the festivities for the Aztec god {{lang|nci|[[Huitzilopochtli]]|italic=no}} (whose name means \"left side of the hummingbird\"; hummingbirds feed on amaranth flowers). The Aztec month of {{lang|nci|[[Aztec calendar|Panquetzaliztli]]|italic=no}} (7 December to 26 December) was dedicated to {{lang|nci|Huitzilopochtli|italic=no}}. People decorated their homes and trees with paper flags; ritual races, processions, dances, songs, prayers, and finally [[human sacrifice]]s were held. This was one of the more important Aztec festivals, and the people prepared for the whole month. They fasted or ate very little; a statue of the god was made out of amaranth seeds and honey, and at the end of the month, it was cut into small pieces so everybody could eat a piece of the god. After the Spanish conquest, cultivation of amaranth was outlawed, while some of the festivities were subsumed into the Christmas celebration.\n\nAmaranth is native to the New World and has been first found in the Old World as part of an archaeological excavation in Narhan, India, dated to 1000-800 B.C.E.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Saraswat |first1=K.S. |last2=Sharma |first2=N.K. |last3=Saini |first3=D.C. |title=Plant Economy at Ancient Narhan (ca. 1300 B.C.-300/400 A.D.) in Excavations at Narhan (1984-1989), Appendix IV |date=1994 |publisher=Department of Ancient Indian History, Culture and Archaeology, Banaras Hindu University |location=Varanasi, Uttar Pradesh, India |pages=225\u2013337}}</ref>{{dubious|date=February 2020}}\n\nBecause of its importance as a symbol of indigenous culture, its palatability, ease of cooking, and a protein that is particularly well-suited to human nutritional needs, interest in amaranth seeds (especially ''A. cruentus'' and ''A. hypochondriacus'') revived in the 1970s. It was recovered in Mexico from wild varieties and is now commercially cultivated. It is a popular snack in Mexico, sometimes mixed with chocolate or puffed rice, and its use has spread to Europe and parts of North America.

Most amaranth in American food products starts as a ground flour, blended with wheat or other flours to create cereals, crackers, cookies, bread or other baked products. Despite utilization studies showing that amaranth can be blended with other flours at levels above 50% without affecting functional properties or taste, most commercial products use amaranth only as a minor portion of their ingredients despite them being marketed as \"amaranth\" products.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.extension.iastate.edu/alternativeag/cropproduction/amaranth.html |title=Amaranth: Alternative Agriculture |last=Delate |first=Kathleen |publisher=Iowa State University|date=2013}}</ref>\n<!--original research === Seed flour ===\n\nAmaranth seed flour has been evaluated as an additive to wheat flour by food specialists. To determine palatability, different levels of amaranth grain flour were mixed with the wheat flour and baking ingredients (1% salt, 2.5% fat, 1.5% yeast, 10% sugar, and 52\u201374% water), fermented, molded, pan-proofed, and baked. The baked products were evaluated for loaf volume, moisture content, color, odor, taste, and texture. The amaranth-containing products were then compared with bread made from 100% wheat flour. The loaf volume decreased by 40% and the moisture content increased from 22 to 42% with increase in amaranth grain flour. The study found that the sensory scores of the taste, odor, color, and texture decreased with increasing amounts of amaranth. Generally, above 15% amaranth grain flour, significant differences occurred in the evaluated sensory qualities and the high amaranth-containing product was found to be of unacceptable palatability to the population sample that evaluated the baked products.<ref>{{cite journal|title=The effect of amaranth grain flour on the quality of bread|author=Jerome Ayo|doi=10.1081/JFP-100105198|journal=International Journal of Food Properties|year=2001|volume=4|issue=2|pages=341|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1081/JFP-100105198}}</ref>\n -->\n\n=== Leaves, roots, and stems ===\nAmaranth species are cultivated and consumed as a [[leaf vegetable]] in many parts of the world.

Notes on Economic Plants. ''Economic Botany'' 57(4): 646-649</ref>\n\nIn Indonesia and Malaysia, leaf amaranth is called {{lang|id|bayam}}. In the Philippines, the [[Ilocano language|Ilocano]] word for the plant is {{lang|ilo|kalunay}}; the [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]] word for the plant is {{lang|tg|kilitis}} or {{lang|tg|kulitis}}. In [[Uttar Pradesh]] and [[Bihar]] in India, it is called ''chaulai'' and is a popular green leafy vegetable (referred to in the class of vegetable preparations called ''[[saag]]''). It is called ''chua'' in Kumaun area of Uttarakhand, where it is a popular red-green vegetable. In Karnataka in India, it is called ''harive''. It is used to prepare curries such as ''hulee, palya, majjigay-hulee'', and so on. In Kerala, it is called ''cheera'' and is consumed by stir-frying the leaves with spices and red chili peppers to make a dish called ''cheera [[thoran]]''. In Tamil Nadu, it is called ''mulaikkira'' and is regularly consumed as a favourite dish, where the greens are steamed and mashed with light seasoning of salt, red chili pepper, and cumin. It is called ''keerai masial''. In ''Andhra Pradesh'', this leaf is added in preparation of a popular ''[[dal]]'' called {{lang|te|thotakura pappu}} in ([[Telugu language|Telugu]]). In Maharashtra, it is called ''shravani maath'' and is available in both red and white colour. In Orissa, it is called ''khada saga'', it is used to prepare ''saga bhaja'', in which the leaf is fried with chili and onions.\n\nIn China, the leaves and stems are used as a stir-fry vegetable, or in soups. In Vietnam, it is called {{lang|vi|rau d\u1ec1n}} and is used to make [[soup]]. Two species are popular as edible vegetable in Vietnam: {{lang|vi|d\u1ec1n \u0111\u1ecf}} (''Amaranthus tricolor'') and {{lang|vi|d\u1ec1n c\u01a1m}} or {{lang|vi|d\u1ec1n tr\u1eafng}} (''Amaranthus viridis'').\n\nA traditional food plant in Africa, amaranth has the potential to improve nutrition, boost [[food security]], foster rural development and support sustainable land care.<ref>{{cite book |authorlink= |author=National Research Council |title=Lost Crops of Africa: Volume II: Vegetables |url=http://books.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=11763 |format= |accessdate=2008-07-15 |edition= |series=Lost Crops of Africa |volume=2 |date=2006-10-27 |publisher=National Academies Press |location= |isbn=978-0-309-10333-6 |oclc=34344933 |doi= 10.17226/11763|id= |pages= |chapter=Amaranth |chapterurl=http://books.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=11763&page=35 |quote= |ref= }}</ref>\n\nIn Bantu regions of Uganda and western Kenya, it is known as ''doodo'' or ''litoto''.<ref>{{cite book | author=Goode, P.

It is boiled, then served with olive oil and lemon juice like a salad, sometimes alongside fried fish. Greeks stop harvesting the plant (which also grows wild) when it starts to bloom at the end of August.\n\nIn Brazil, green amaranth was, and to a degree still is, often considered an invasive species as all other species of amaranth (except the generally imported ''A. caudatus'' cultivar), though some have traditionally appreciated it as a leaf vegetable, under the names of {{lang|pt|caruru}} or {{lang|pt|bredo}}, which is consumed cooked, generally accompanying the staple food, [[rice and beans]].\n\n===Oil===\nMaking up about 5% of the total [[fatty acid]]s of amaranth, [[squalene]]<ref name=\"HeCai2002\">{{cite journal|last1=He|first1=Han-Ping|last2=Cai|first2=Yizhong|last3=Sun|first3=Mei|last4=Corke|first4=Harold|title=Extraction and Purification of Squalene from Amaranthus Grain|journal=Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry|volume=50|issue=2|year=2002|pages=368\u2013372|issn=0021-8561|doi=10.1021/jf010918p|pmid=11782209}}</ref> is extracted as a vegetable-based alternative to the more expensive [[shark oil]] for use in [[dietary supplements]] and [[cosmetics]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/squalene-market-size-to-exceed-usd-240-million-by-2022-global-market-insights-inc-577232031.html |title=Squalene Market Size to Exceed USD 240 Million by 2022|publisher= Global Market Insights Inc. |date=27 April 2016|accessdate=14 December 2016}}</ref>\n\n=== Dyes ===\nThe flowers of the 'Hopi Red Dye' amaranth were used by the [[Hopi]] (a tribe in the western United States) as the source of a deep red [[natural dye|dye]]. Also a synthetic dye was named \"[[Amaranth (dye)|amaranth]]\" for its similarity in color to the natural amaranth [[pigment]]s known as [[betalain]]s. This synthetic dye is also known as Red No. 2 in North America and E123 in the European Union.<ref>\"The following color additives are not authorized for use in food products in the United States: (1) Amaranth (C.I. 16185, EEC No. E123, formerly certifiable as FD&C red No. 2);\" [http://www.cfsan.fda.gov/~comm/cp03803.html FDA/CFSAN Food Compliance Program: Domestic Food Safety Program] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929110929/http://www.cfsan.fda.gov/~comm/cp03803.html |date=2007-09-29 }}</ref>\n\n=== Ornamentals ===\n[[File:Amaranthus flowers.jpg|thumb|''A. hypochondriacus'' (prince's feather) flowering]]\nThe genus also contains several well-known ornamental plants, such as ''Amaranthus caudatus'' (love-lies-bleeding), a vigorous, hardy annual with dark purplish [[flower]]s crowded in handsome drooping spikes. Another Indian annual, ''A. hypochondriacus'' (prince's feather), has deeply veined, lance-shaped leaves, purple on the under face, and deep crimson flowers densely packed on erect spikes.\n\nAmaranths are recorded as food plants for some [[Lepidoptera]] ([[butterfly]] and [[moth]]) species including the [[Nutmeg (moth)|nutmeg moth]] and various case-bearer moths of the genus ''[[Coleophora]]'': ''C. amaranthella'', ''C. enchorda'' (feeds exclusively on ''Amaranthus''), ''C. immortalis'' (feeds exclusively on ''Amaranthus''), ''C. lineapulvella'', and ''C. versurella'' (recorded on ''A. spinosus'').\n\n== Ecology ==\nAmaranth weed species have an extended period of germination, rapid growth, and high rates of seed production,<ref name = \"Bensch\"/> and have been causing problems for farmers since the mid-1990s. This is partially due to the reduction in [[tillage]], reduction in herbicidal use and the evolution of herbicidal resistance in several species where herbicides have been applied more often.<ref>Wetzel et al. (1999). Use of PCR-based molecular markers to identify weedy Amaranthus species. Weed Science 47: 518-523.</ref> The following 9 species of ''Amaranthus'' are considered invasive and noxious weeds in the U.S and Canada: [[Amaranthus albus|''A. albus'']], [[Amaranthus blitoides|''A. blitoides'']], [[Amaranthus hybridus|''A. hybridus'']], [[Amaranthus palmeri|''A. palmeri'']], [[Amaranthus powellii|''A. powellii'']], [[Amaranthus retroflexus|''A. retroflexus'']], [[Amaranthus spinosus|''A. spinosus'']], [[Amaranthus tuberculatus|''A. tuberculatus'']], and [[Amaranthus viridis|''A. viridis'']].<ref>[http://plants.usda.gov/java/profile?symbol=AMARA USDA Plant Database.

The Botanical Review, 83(4), 382-436.]</ref>\n\nA new herbicide-resistant strain of ''[[Amaranthus palmeri]]'' has appeared; it is [[glyphosate]]-resistant and so cannot be killed by herbicides using the chemical. Also, this plant can survive in tough conditions. The species ''Amaranthus palmeri'' (Palmer amaranth) causes the greatest reduction in [[soybean]] yields and has the potential to reduce yields by 17-68% in field experiments.<ref name = \"Bensch\"/> Palmer amaranth is among the \"top five most troublesome weeds\" in the southeast of the United States and has already evolved resistances to [[dinitroaniline]] herbicides and [[acetolactate synthase inhibitor]]s.<ref>Culpepper et al. (2006). Glyphosate-resistant Palmer amaranth (''Amaranthus palmeri'') confirmed in Georgia. Weed Science 54: 620-626.</ref> This makes the proper identification of ''Amaranthus'' species at the seedling stage essential for agriculturalists. Proper weed control needs to be applied before the species successfully colonizes in the crop field and causes significant yield reductions.\n\nAn evolutionary lineage of around 90 species within the genus has acquired the [[C4 carbon fixation|{{C4}} carbon fixation]] pathway, which increases their photosynthetic efficiency.
