The car was then internally designated the Volkswagen Type 1, and marketed simply as the Volkswagen. Later models were designated Volkswagen 1200, 1300, 1500, 1302, or 1303, the former three indicating [[engine displacement]], the latter two derived from the model number. The car became widely known in its home country as the ''K\u00e4fer'' (German for \"[[beetle]]\", cognate with English [[Wikt:chafer|chafer]]) and was later marketed under that name in Germany,<ref name= samba-1973-de-super/> and as the Volkswagen in other countries. For example, in France it was known as the {{lang|fr|Coccinelle}}<!--was that an official VW model name or just a common nickname?--> (French for [[coccinellidae|ladybug]]).<ref name=\"samba-1970-ca-full\"/><ref name=\"samba-1970-us-super\"/> In 1943, [[Roy Fedden]] applied for a patent, [[https://worldwide.espacenet.com/patent/search/family/010067840/publication/GB570814A]] GB570814, 'Improvements relating to road vehicles', a car identical to VW K\u00e4fer.\n\nThe original 25&nbsp;hp Beetle was designed for a top speed around 100&nbsp;km/h (62&nbsp;mph), which would be a viable cruising speed on the ''[[Reichsautobahn]]'' system. As Autobahn speeds increased in the postwar years, its output was boosted to 36, then 40&nbsp;hp, the configuration that lasted through 1966 and became the \"classic\" Volkswagen motor. The Beetle gave rise to multiple variants: mainly the 1950 [[Volkswagen Type 2|Type 2 'Bus']], the 1955 [[Volkswagen Karmann Ghia|Karmann Ghia]], as well as the 1961 [[Volkswagen Type 3|Type 3 'Ponton']] and the 1968 [[Volkswagen Type 4|Type 4 (411/412)]] [[family car]]s, ultimately forming the basis of an entirely rear-engined VW product range. The Beetle thus marked a significant trend, led by Volkswagen, and then by [[Fiat]] and [[Renault]], whereby the [[rear-engine, rear-wheel-drive layout]] increased from 2.6&nbsp;percent of continental Western Europe's car production in 1946 to 26.6&nbsp;percent in 1956.<ref name=SmallCar196501>{{cite journal |authorlink= Laurence Pomeroy |title=BMC's Mini: The Background story: Part one: The Volkswagen cometh |journal=[[Car Magazine|Small Car]] |pages=42\u201347 |date=January 1965}}</ref> In 1959 even General Motors launched an air-cooled, rear-engined car, the [[Chevrolet Corvair]]\u2014which even shared the Beetle's flat engine and [[swing axle]] architecture.\n\nOver time, [[front-wheel drive]], and frequently [[hatchback]]-bodied cars would come to dominate the European small-car market. In 1974, Volkswagen's own front-wheel drive [[Volkswagen Golf|Golf]] hatchback succeeded the Beetle. In 1994, Volkswagen unveiled the [[Volkswagen New Beetle#History|Concept One]], a \"retro\"-themed [[concept car]] with a resemblance to the original Beetle, and in 1998 introduced the \"[[Volkswagen New Beetle|New Beetle]]\", built on the [[Volkswagen Golf Mk4|contemporary Golf]] platform with styling recalling the original Type 1.

The Japanese had refined rear-wheel-drive, water-cooled, front-engine, small cars including the [[Datsun 510]] and [[Toyota Corona]], whose sales in the North American market grew rapidly at the expense of Volkswagen in the late 1960s.  [[Honda]] introduced the [[Honda N360|N600]], based on the space-efficient transverse-engine, front-wheel-drive layout of the original [[Austin Mini]], to the North American market in late 1969, and upgraded the model to the [[Honda Civic]] in 1972.  The Japanese \"big three\" would soon dominate compact auto sales in North America.  In 1971 [[Ford]] introduced its [[Ford Pinto|Pinto]], which had some market impact as a low cost alternative in the wake of the [[Nixon shock|drop of the US Dollar against the Deutsche Mark]] that same year.  As the 1960s came to a close, Volkswagen faced increasingly stiff competition from European cars as well.  The Beetle was faced with competition from new designs like the [[Fiat 127]] and [[Renault 5]], and more robust designs based on the Austin Mini layout such as the [[supermini car|Superminis]]. German competitors, [[Ford]] and [[Opel]] also enjoyed strong sales of modern smaller cars like the [[Ford Escort (Europe)|Ford Escort]] and [[Opel Kadett]].  Volkswagen's attempts to boost the power of their air-cooled motor to meet the demands of higher highway speeds in the late 1960s, then comply with new pollution control regulations, caused problems for reliability and fuel efficiency that impaired the reputation of the aging design.  Safety issues with the Beetle came under increasing scrutiny, culminating in the 1972 release of a rather scathing report.<ref>{{cite book|author=Center for Auto Safety|title=Small on Safety:The designed-in dangers of the Volkswagen|date= 1972|isbn=978-0670652495}}</ref>  During the early 1970s, sales of the Beetle in Europe and North America plummeted.\n\nVW introduced other models to supplement the Beetle throughout the 1960s; the [[VW Type 3|Type 3]], [[VW Type 4|Type 4]], and the NSU-based and larger [[VW K70|K70]].  None of these models, aimed at more upscale markets, achieved the level of success of the Beetle. The over-reliance on a single model, now in decline, meant that Volkswagen was in financial crisis by 1974. It needed German government funding to produce the Beetle's replacement.\n\nProduction lines at Wolfsburg switched to the new water-cooled, front-engined, [[front-wheel-drive]] [[Volkswagen Golf|Golf]] designed by [[Giorgetto Giugiaro]] in 1974, sold in North America at the time as the \"Rabbit\".  The Golf eventually became Volkswagen's most successful model since the Beetle. It was periodically redesigned over its lifetime, with only a few components carried over between generations, entering its seventh generation in 2012; the Beetle had only minor refinements of its original design.\n\nThe Golf did not kill Beetle production, nor did the smaller [[Volkswagen Polo|Polo]] which was launched a year later. Production of the Beetle continued in smaller numbers at other German factories until 19 January 1978, when mainstream production shifted to Brazil and Mexico: markets where low operating cost was an important factor. After this shift in production, sales in Europe did not stop, but became very low. Beetle sedans were produced for U.S. markets until July 1977<ref name=\"TheSamba.com\">Beetle VIN / Chassis Numbers - TheSamba.com {{cite web|url=http://www.thesamba.com/vw/archives/info/bugchassisdating.php|title=Beetle VIN / Chassis Numbers - TheSamba.com}}</ref> and for European markets until 1985, with other companies continuing to import cars produced in Mexico after 1985. The Beetle convertible/Cabriolet ended production (as 1979 models) on January 31, 1980.<ref name=\"TheSamba.com\"/>\n\nThe last Beetle was produced in [[Puebla, Puebla|Puebla]], Mexico, in July 2003.<ref name=\"AutoMotoruSport200313\"/> The final batch of 3,000 Beetles were sold as 2004 models and badged as the ''\u00daltima Edici\u00f3n'', with [[whitewall tires]], a host of previously discontinued chrome trim, and the choice of two special paint colors taken from the [[New Beetle]]. Production in Brazil ended in 1986, then started again in 1993 and continued until 1996.\n\nThe Beetle outlasted most other cars which had adopted the rear-engine, air-cooled layout such as those by [[Subaru 360|Subaru]], [[Fiat]], and [[Chevrolet Corvair|General Motors]]. Porsche's 356 series which originally used some Volkswagen-sourced parts, continued to use the classic rear-engine layout (which later became water cooled) in the [[Porsche 911]] 996 series, which remains competitive in the third decade of the 21st century.\n\n=== Worldwide end of production ===\n[[File:Volkswagen Bubbla sista bilen.jpg|thumb|\"\u00daltima Edici\u00f3n\" (Final Edition) in Aquarius Blue (2003).]]\nBy 2002, over 21 million Type 1s had been produced, but by 2003, annual production had dropped to 30,000 from a peak of 1.3&nbsp;million in 1971.

An engine oil cooler (located in the engine fan's shroud) ensured optimal engine operating temperature and long engine life, optimized by a thermostat that bypassed the oil cooler when the engine was cold. Later models of the carburetor featured an automatic [[choke valve|choke]]. Engine intake air passed through a metallic filter, while heavier particles were captured by an oil bath.

After successfully presenting it at VW in Wolfsburg the Beetle Cabriolet began production in 1949 by [[Karmann]] in [[Osnabr\u00fcck]].\n\nThe convertible was more than a Beetle with a folding top. To compensate for the strength lost in removing the roof, the sills were reinforced with welded U-channel rails, a transverse beam was fitted below the front edge of the rear seat cushion, and the side cowl-panels below the instrument panel were double-wall. In addition, the lower corners of the door apertures had welded-in curved gussets, and the doors had secondary alignment wedges at the B-pillar.\n\nThe top was cabriolet-style with a full inner headliner hiding the folding mechanism and crossbars. In between the two top layers was {{convert|1|in|mm|abbr=on}} of insulation. The rear window was tempered safety glass, and after 1968, heated. Due to the thickness of the top, it remained quite tall when folded. To enable the driver to see over the lowered top, the inside rearview was mounted on an offset pivot. By twisting the mirror 180 degrees on a longitudinal axis, the mirror glass would raise approximately {{convert|2|in|cm|abbr=on}}.\n\nThe convertible was generally more lavishly equipped than the sedan with dual rear ashtrays, twin map pockets, a visor vanity mirror on the passenger side, rear stone shields, and through 1969, wheel trim rings. Many of these items did not become available on other Beetles until the advent of the optional \"L\" (Luxus) Package of 1970.\n\nAfter a number of stylistic and technical alterations made to the Karmann cabriolet,<ref>{{cite web |author=Jon Gilbert |url=http://www.volksworld.com/news/cars/279437/1963-vw-beetle-cabriolet.html |title=volksworld.com |publisher=volksworld.com |date=2008-10-31 |accessdate=2012-01-15 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120809014310/http://www.volksworld.com/news/cars/279437/1963-vw-beetle-cabriolet.html |archive-date=9 August 2012 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref> (corresponding to the many changes VW made to the Beetle throughout its history), the last of 331,847 cabriolets came off the production line on 10 January 1980.\n\n===1950\u20131959 models===\n[[File:VW K\u00e4fer blue 1956 vr TCE.jpg|thumb|1956 Volkswagen Beetle]]\n\nDuring this period, a myriad of changes were made throughout the vehicle beginning with the availability of hydraulic brakes and a folding fabric sunroof in 1950.

The traditional VW semaphore turn signals were replaced by conventional flashing directional indicator lamps for North America.\n\nFor 1956, the Beetle received what would become one of its more distinctive features, a set of twin chrome tailpipes. Models for North America gained taller bumper guards and tubular overrider bars.\n\nFor 1958, the Beetle received a revised instrument panel, and a larger rectangular rear window replaced the previous oval design.\n\n===1960\u20131969 models===\n\n1960 models received a front [[sway bar|anti roll bar]] along with hydraulic [[steering damper]].\n\nFor 1961, significant technical advances occurred in the form of a new engine and transmission. The engine remained at {{cvt|1192|cc|L CID|1|abbr=on}} but the power increased to {{convert|40|bhp|PS kW|abbr=on}} at 3900 rpm and {{convert|88|Nm|lbft|abbr=on}} at 2400 rpm of [[Torque#Machine torque|torque]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.conceptcarz.com/s7533/Volkswagen-Beetle.aspx|website=conceptcarz|title=1963 Volkswagen Beetle Technical Specifications and Dimensions|accessdate=July 1, 2018}}</ref> primarily due to an increase in [[compression ratio]] to 7.1:1. The single-barrel [[Solex]] [[carburetor]] received an electric automatic choke and the transmission was now [[Manual transmission#Synchromesh|synchronized]] on all forward gears. The traditional semaphore turn signals were replaced by conventional flashing directional indicators worldwide. The standard model called the TYPE 111-112, continued to use the 36&nbsp;hp 1200 engine of the old architecture that dates back to Franz Reimspiess original design of 1937 all the way until the end of the 1965 model year. 1965 standard model in 1965 is called the \"A\" sedan.\n\nFor 1962, the Beetle received a mechanical fuel level gauge in place of the former fuel tap. The Standard model continued without a gas gauge until the end of the 1965 model year. At the rear, larger tail lights were introduced incorporating a separate amber turn signal section to meet new European standards (these turn signals remained red in the US market until 1973). The former hand-pump style windscreen washer was replaced by a new design using compressed air. A [[Schrader valve]] located on the washer fluid tank allowed the system to be charged at a filling station to the recommended {{convert|35|psi|bar|abbr=on}}.<ref>{{Cite book | title = The Beetle: The Chronicles of the People's Car| author=H.R. Etzold| publisher = Haynes Publishing Group |date= 1988 | page = 77 }}</ref>\n\n1964 models could be identified by a widened light housing on the engine lid over the rear license plate, however the standard model continued to use the old teardrop style to the end of the 1965 model run.\n\nThe largest change to date for the Beetle was in 1965: the majority of the body stampings were revised, which allowed for significantly larger windows. The windshield increased in area by 11% and was now slightly curved, rather than flat. Door windows increased accordingly by 6% (and door vent window edges were canted slightly back), rear side windows 17.5%, and the rear window 19.5%. The result was a more open, airy, modern look.<ref name=\"Small Wonder\">{{Cite book | title = Small Wonder| author=Walter Henry Nelson| publisher = Little, Brown and Co. |date= 1970 | page = 308 }}</ref>\n\nFor 1966, the big news was an optional new 1300cc {{convert|50|hp|kW PS|abbr=on}} engine in lieu of the previous 1200cc engine that had been the sole engine since 1954. Models so equipped carried a \"1300\" badge on the engine lid. The 1300cc engine was standard for North America.\n\nFor 1967, a yet-again larger-[[engine displacement|displacement]] engine was made available: [[Volkswagen air-cooled engine|1500cc]], {{convert|53|hp|kW PS|abbr=on}} at 4,200&nbsp;rpm.<ref name=\"TAM67\">{{Cite book | title = Quattroruote Speciale: Tutte le Auto del Mondo 1967 | publisher = Editoriale Domus S.p.A |date=February 1967 | language = Italian | pages = 296\u2013298 | location = Milano }}</ref> 1200 and 1300 engines continued to be available, as many markets based their taxation on engine size.<ref name=\"TAM67\"/> 1500cc Beetles were equipped with front disc brakes and were identified with a \"VW 1500\" badge on the engine lid. North America received the 1500 engine as standard equipment, but did not receive front disc brakes. These models were identified by a \"Volkswagen\" badge on the engine lid.\n\nThe rear suspension was significantly revised and included a widened track, softer torsion bars and the addition of a unique ''Z-configuration'' equalizing torsion spring. On US, UK and Ireland models, the generator output was increased from 180 to 360&nbsp;watts, and the entire electrical system was upgraded from 6 volts to 12 volts. The clutch disc also increased in size and changes were made to the [[flywheel]]. New equipment included a driver's armrest on the door and locking buttons on both doors. Safety improvements included two-speed [[windscreen wiper]]s, reversing lights (in some markets), and a driver's side mirror. In accord with the newly enacted US [[Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard 108]], North American models received a dual-circuit brake system, the clear glass [[headlamp]] covers were deleted; the headlamps were brought forward to the leading edge of the front fenders, and the sealed-beam units were exposed and surrounded by chrome bezels. In the rest of the world markets the 1967 model retained the older headlights. Another oddity of the 1967 North American market Beetle is the rear bumper overriders (towel rails) \u2013 the overriders have a different shape than the older models besides the one-year only engine decklid.{{clarify|reason=what does the end of this sentence (from \"besides\") mean?|date=October 2018}} The Brazilian market model (Volkswagen Fusca) retained the pre-1967 headlamps until 1972.{{Citation needed|reason=Entire paragraph needs a source, please|date=October 2018}}\n\n[[File:'68 VW 1500.jpg|thumb|1968 Type 1]]\n1968 was a year of major change. The most noticeable of which were the new larger, higher mounted C-section bumpers. At the rear, new larger taillamps were adopted and were able to accommodate reversing lamps, which were previously separate bumper-mounted units. Beetles worldwide received the '67 North American style vertical headlamp placement, but with replaceable-bulb headlamps compliant with [[ECE regulations]] rather than the US sealed beams. Other improvements were a new outside gas filler with spring-loaded flap, eliminating the need to open the trunk to refuel. The fuel gauge was integrated with the speedometer and was now electrically actuated rather than cable-operated. The windscreen washer was now pressured by the spare tire, which was to be maintained at a pressure of {{convert|42|psi|bar|abbr=on}}. A pressure valve in the connecting hose closed airflow to the fluid reservoir if spare tire pressure fell below {{convert|30|psi|bar|abbr=on}}, which was above the recommended pressures for the road tires.<ref>\">{{Cite book | title = The Beetle:  The Chronicles of the People's Car| author=H.R. Etzold| publisher = Haynes Publishing Group |date= 1988 | page = 123 }}</ref> A ventilation system was introduced, which drew fresh air into the cabin from louvres on the front decklid.  For improved shifting, the shift lever was shortened, stiffened and moved rearward by {{convert|78|mm|in|abbr=on}}.\n\nA number of safety improvements were made in order to comply with new American safety regulations: these included trigger-operated outside door handles, a secondary front hood latch, collapsing steering column, soft vent window latches, rotary glove compartment latch and instrument panel knobs labeled with [[pictographs]]. US models received a padded instrument panel that was optional in other markets. To meet North American head restraint requirements, VW developed the industry's first high-back bucket seat.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}} The Standard model 111-112, called the 1200 \"A\" still used the 1200 engine but for the first time for Europe it came with a 12 volt system.\n\n[[File:'68 Volkswagen AutoStick Badge.jpg|thumb|'68\u2013'69 Automatic ''StickShift'' badge]]\n\nA new 3-speed [[manumatic]] gear box with [[torque converter]] and vacuum-operated clutch became available mid-production year. The manumatic models received a vastly improved [[Trailing arm|semi-trailing-arm]] rear suspension (also known as \"independent rear suspension\" although the earlier swing axle Beetles were also [[Suspension (vehicle)#Independent suspension|independent]]) and eliminated the need for the equalizing torsion spring. This new rear suspension layout would eventually become an option on later models. Beetles equipped with the automatic were identified with a \"VW Automatic\" badge on the engine lid and a matching decal in the rear window. In North America, the badging and decal were later revised to read, \"Automatic ''Stick Shift''\".\n\nFor 1969, the only exterior change was the fuel filler flap no longer had a finger indentation due to a new interior-mounted fuel door release. For North America, the Beetle received a heated rear window, day/night mirror and the semi-trailing, independent suspension with double jointed swing axles as standard equipment. In other markets, manual transmission models retained a swing axle independent suspension which would continue until the end of German Beetle production.\n\n===1970\u20131979 models===\nIn 1970, a new \"L\" (Luxus) Package was introduced including, among other items, twin map pockets, dual rear ashtrays, full carpeting, a passenger-side visor vanity mirror, and rubber bumper moldings. The optional 1500&nbsp;cc engine now came with an engine lid having two rows of cooling louvers, while the convertible's engine lid gained two additional sets for a total of four. For North America, the 1500&nbsp;cc engine was enlarged to 1600&nbsp;cc engine and produced {{convert|57|hp|kW PS|abbr=on}}\n\nThere were two Beetles for the first time in 1971, the familiar standard Beetle and a new, larger version, different from the windscreen forward. All Beetles received an engine upgrade: the optional 1500 cc engine was replaced by a 1600 cc with twin-port cylinder heads and a larger, relocated oil cooler. The new engine produced {{convert|60|hp|kW PS|abbr=on}}. The ventilation system was improved with the original dash-top vents augmented by a second pair aimed directly at the driver and passenger. For the first time the system was a flow-through design with crescent-shaped air exits fitted behind the rear quarter windows. Airflow could be increased via an optional 2-speed fan. The standard Beetle was now badged as the VW 1300; when equipped with the 1600 engine, it was badged 1300 S, to avoided confusion with the Type 3, which wore VW 1600 badges.\n\n{{Multiple image\n| align = \n| direction = vertical\n| total_width = 230\n| image1 = D\u00fclmen, Kirchspiel, VW 1303 -- 2017 -- 2279.jpg\n| alt1 = \n| caption1 = Beetle 1303 Cabriolet\n| image2 = M\u00fcnster, Volkswagen 1303 Cabrio -- 2018 -- 2475.jpg\n| caption2 = Detail\n}}\n\nThe new, larger Beetle was sold as the 1302/1302 S, offering nearly 43% more luggage capacity, up from 140 liters in front to 260 (remaining at 140 in back)<ref name=\"The Beetle: The Chronicles of the People's Car.\">{{Cite book | title = The Beetle:  The Chronicles of the Peoples' Car | author= Volkswagen of America| publisher = Haynes Publishing. |date= 1988 | pages = 140}}</ref> A new [[MacPherson strut]] front suspension was incorporated, similar to what was used in the Type 4, and the front track was widened. The new suspension layout allowed the spare tire to be positioned flat under the trunk floor. Although the car had to be lengthened slightly to accomplish this, it allowed a reduction in turning radius. To gain additional trunk volume, the under-dash panel{{clarify|date=May 2017|what is that, exactly?}} was lowered, allowing the fuel tank to be shifted rearward. From the windscreen back the big Beetle was identical to its smaller progenitor, except for having the also new [[trailing-arm suspension|semi-trailing arm]] rear suspension as standard equipment. Overall, the bigger Beetle was {{convert|50|mm|in|abbr=on}} longer, {{convert|35|mm|in|abbr=on}} wider, and rode on a {{convert|20|mm|in|abbr=on}}-longer wheelbase. Both Beetles were available with or without the L Package. The convertible was now based on the 1302 body. In North America, the 1302 was marketed as the Super Beetle and came only with the L Package and 1600 cc engine. While it lacked the front disc brakes that normally accompanied the larger motor, it was fitted with brake drums that were slightly larger than the standard Beetle. With the Super Beetle being sold as the premium model in North America, the standard Beetle, while retaining the same 1600 cc engine, was stripped of many of its earlier features in order to reduce the selling price. Bright window and running board moldings disappeared, along with the day/night mirror, horn ring, map pocket, locking glove box and miscellaneous other items.\n\n1972 models had an 11% larger rear window ({{convert|40|mm|in|abbr=on|disp=sqbr}} taller), and the convertible engine lid with four rows of louvres was now used on all Beetles. Inside the vehicle, a four-spoke energy-absorbing steering wheel was introduced, the windshield wiper/washer knob was replaced in favor of a steering column stalk, and intermittent wipers were a new option available in selected markets. An engine compartment socket for the proprietary VW Diagnosis system was also introduced. The rear luggage area was fitted with a folding parcel shelf. A limited-edition Commemorative model was launched in celebration of the Beetle's passing the record of the Ford Model T as the world's most-produced automobile.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sebeetles.com/marathon/ |title=1972 Marathon Beetle - All the VW Beetle Special Editions |publisher=SE Beetles |date=2016-05-20 |accessdate=2016-07-10}}</ref> The Commemorative Beetle was a 1302 S finished in a special Marathon Blue Metallic paint and unique 4.5 x 15 styled steel wheels. In the U.S., it was marketed as the Super Beetle Baja Champion SE.\n \n[[File:Volkswagen Beetle .jpg|thumb|1973 1303/Super Beetle]]\n[[File:1973-1974 Volkswagen \"1303 Big\", Istanbul.jpg|left|thumb|1973\u201374 1303/Super Beetle \"Big\"]]\n\n1973 models featured significantly enlarged \"elephant foot\" taillamps mounted in reshaped rear fenders. In the engine bay, the oil-bath air cleaner gave way to a dry element filter, and the generator was replaced with an alternator. The 1302/Super became the 1303 with a new taller wrap-around windscreen. The changes to the cowl and windshield resulted in slight redesign of the front hood. The instrument panel, formerly shared with the standard Beetle, was all-new and incorporated a raised speedometer pod, rocker-style switches and side-window defrosters.  The limited-edition GSR (Gelb-Schwarzer Renner; German for \"Yellow-Black Racer\") was a 1303 S available only in Saturn Yellow paint equipped with special {{convert|5.5|in|mm|abbr=on}} wide sport wheels fitted with 175/70-15 Pirelli Cinturato CN36 high-performance radial tires. Front and rear deck lids were finished in matte black, as was all exterior trim with the exception of the chrome headlamp bezels. Inside were [[corduroy]] and leatherette high-bolstered sport seats and a small diameter three-spoke steering wheel with padded leather rim and a small red VW logo on the bottom spoke. In North America, the GSR was sold as the Super Beetle Sports Bug. The North American model had body-color deck lids and was available in Marathon Blue Metallic in addition to Saturn Yellow. In some markets, the sport wheels (in both 4.5-inch and 5.5-inch widths), sport steering wheel and sport seats became available as stand-alone options.\n\nFor 1974, North American models received newly required {{convert|5|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} impact bumpers mounted on self-restoring energy absorbers, which added approximately {{convert|25|mm|in|abbr=on}} to the car's overall length. On the Super Beetle, the steering knuckle, and consequently the lower attachment point of the strut, was redesigned to improve handling and stability in the event of a tire blowout. A limited-edition Big Beetle was introduced based on the 1303 LS. Available in unique metallic paint colors, the car featured styled-steel {{convert|5.5|in|mm|abbr=on}} wide sport wheels wrapped in 175/70-15 tires, corduroy seat inserts, upgraded loop-pile carpet, wood-look instrument panel trim and a padded steering wheel with bright accents. In the North American market, a limited-edition Sun Bug was introduced as a standard Beetle or Super Beetle. Both were finished in metallic gold and featured styled-steel {{convert|4.5|in|mm|abbr=on}}-wide sport wheels. Inside were brown corduroy and leatherette seats, loop-pile carpet, and padded four-spoke deluxe steering wheel. The Super Beetle Sun Bug included a sliding-steel sunroof. Mid-year, the Love Bug was introduced for North America: based on the standard Beetle, it was available only in Phoenix Red or Ravenna Green (both colors shared with the [[Porsche 914|VW-Porsche 914]]) with all exterior trim finished in matte black. A price leader, the Love Bug retailed for less than a standard Beetle.\n\nIn 1975, front turn indicators were moved from the top of the front fenders down into the bumper. At the rear, the license plate light housing was now molded of plastic with a ribbed top surface. To comply with tightening emission standards, the 1600 cc engine in Japanese and North American markets received Bosch [[Jetronic#L|L-Jetronic]] fuel injection, rather than the [[Jetronic#D|D-Jetronic]] system formerly used in the VW Type 3 and Type 4. The injected engine received a new muffler and in California a catalytic converter. This necessitated a bulge in the rear apron under the rear bumper and replaced the distinctive twin \"pea shooter\" tailpipes with a single offset pipe, making injected models identifiable at a glance.  {{convert|5|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} bumper-equipped North American models retained fender-top front indicators. The 1303 received rack and pinion steering. In North America, the 1303/Super Beetle sedan was moved upmarket and was now christened La Grande Bug. Similar to the Big Beetle of 1974, La Grande Bug was available in blue or green metallic paint in the U.S. and blue, green or gold metallic in Canada and was equipped with the same features as the 1974 Sun Bug. The \"Volkswagen\" script on the engine lid of all North American Beetles was replaced with a \"Fuel Injection\" badge.\n\nIn 1976, the 1303/La Grande Bug was discontinued, with the larger body continuing only in convertible form. To make up for the loss in North American markets, the standard Beetle was upgraded, regaining some of the features that were removed in 1971. In addition, the 2-speed ventilation fan was included, previously available in North America only on the larger Beetle. The automatic stickshift option was discontinued as well.\n\n1977 models received new front seats with separate head restraints.  This was the final model year for the Beetle sedan in North America. The convertible was offered in a \"triple white\" Champagne Edition in Alpine White with  white top and interior with the padded deluxe steering wheel, tiger maple wood-grain dash trim and {{convert|4.5|in|mm|abbr=on}} wide sport wheels. Approximately 1,000 Champagne Editions were produced.\n\nFor 1978, a new Champagne 2nd Edition convertible was launched, available in blue or red metallic paint with white leatherette interior. Features included the {{convert|4.5|in|mm|abbr=on}} wide styled steel sport wheels, AM/FM radio, analog [[quartz clock]], padded deluxe steering wheel and rosewood-grain instrument panel trim. Approximately 1,100 were produced.\n\nIn 1979, VW offered an Epilogue Edition of the convertible in triple black with features similar to the 1978 Champagne Edition. This would be the last year of convertible production worldwide as well as the final year for the Beetle in the USA and Canada.\n\n== Introduction to international markets ==\n\n===Ireland ===\n{{Main|History of Volkswagen in Ireland}}\n\nVolkswagen began its involvement in Ireland when in 1949, Motor Distributors Limited, founded by Stephen O'Flaherty secured the [[franchising|franchise]] for the country at that year\u2019s [[Paris Motor Show]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.tribune.ie/archive/article/2003/sep/14/motor-moguls-facing-end-of-an-era/ |title=Motor moguls facing end of an era |author=Brian Carey |newspaper=[[Sunday Tribune]] |date=14 September 2003 |accessdate=6 November 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160310065902/http://tribune.ie/archive/article/2003/sep/14/motor-moguls-facing-end-of-an-era |archivedate=10 March 2016 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.independent.ie/business/the-motor-moguls-955766.html|title=The Motor Moguls|work=[[Irish Independent]]|date=5 July 2007|accessdate=6 November 2009}}</ref> In 1950, Volkswagen Beetles started arriving into [[Dublin]] packed in crates in what was termed \"[[knockdown kit|completely knocked down]]\" (CKD) form ready to be assembled.

In 1993 production resumed and continued to 1996. The Brazilian version retained the 1958\u201364 body style (Europe and U.S. version) with the thick door pillars and smaller side windows. This body style was also produced in Mexico until 1971. Around 1973, all Brazilian Beetles (1300 and 1500 series) were updated with the 1968-up sheet metal, bumpers, and four-lug rims; although the five-stud rims and \"bugeye\" headlights were produced as late as 1972 (the base VW 1200 and 1300 manufactured in Brazil was similar to the 1964 European/U.S. 1200 until the 1970 model year but came with vented wheels since the mid-1960s). The 1971 and 1972 1300s had the 1964-era taillights and headlights, fuel tank, but fitted with the 1968-up raised bumpers. Brazilian CKD kits were shipped to Nigeria between 1975 and 1987 where Beetles were locally assembled. The Brazilian-produced versions have been sold in neighboring South American nations bordering Brazil, including Argentina, Uruguay, and Peru.\n\nThe Brazilian Type 1s have four different engines: 1,200&nbsp;cc, 1,300&nbsp;cc, 1,500&nbsp;cc, and 1,600&nbsp;cc. In the 1970s, Volkswagen made the SP-2 (derived from the Type 1 pan and the Type 3 powertrain) with a 1,700&nbsp;cc engine (a [[cylinder bore|bored-out]] 1,600&nbsp;cc). In Brazil, the Type 1 never received electronic fuel injection, instead retaining carburetors (one or two one-barrels) throughout its entire life, although the carburetion differs from engines of different years and specification.\n\nThe production of the air-cooled engine finally ended in 2006, after more than 60 years.  It was last used in the Brazilian version of the [[Volkswagen Type 2|VW Bus]], called the \"Kombi\", and was replaced by a 1.4&nbsp;L water-cooled engine with a front-mounted cooling system. [[Volkswagen do Brasil]] engaged in some string pulling in the early sixties when a law requiring taxis to have four doors and five seats was being considered. After proving that the average taxi fare only carried 1.8 passengers and an overall saving of twenty percent for a smaller two-door car, the Brazilian government relented and the law never entered the books.<ref name=Stern137>[[#stern|''VW-Tochter: Erfolg mit Fusca'']], p. 137</ref> The Fusca proceeded to have a long career as a taxi in urban Brazil.\n\n=== Southern Rhodesia ===\nThe Volkswagen Type 1 chassis was used as the basis for a mine-protected [[armoured personnel carrier|APC]] called the [[Leopard security vehicle]] and the [[Pookie (vehicle)|Pookie]] demining vehicle, fielded by the Republic of Rhodesia during the [[Rhodesian Bush War]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}\n\n=== Mexico ===\n[[File:Sedan Jeans.jpg|thumb|1995 Mexican Volkswagen Beetle, the last model with chrome moldings. In the picture, the 1995 Jeans Limited Edition.]]\n[[File:Volkswagen Bubbla sista bilen.jpg|thumb|The very last Volkswagen Beetle produced, manufactured in Puebla, Mexico, July 30, 2003.]]\n{{Main|Volkswagen Beetle in Mexico}}\nMexican production began in 1955 because of agreements with companies such as [[Chrysler]] in Mexico and the [[Studebaker-Packard Corporation]] which assembled cars imported in CKD form. In 1964, they began to be locally produced.  These models have the larger windshield, rear window, door and quarter glass starting in 1972; and the rear window from 1965 to 1971 German built models was used on the Mexican models from 1972 to 1985, when it was replaced with the larger rear window used on 1972 and later German built Beetles. This version, after the mid-1970s, saw little change with the incorporation of electronic ignition in 1988, an anti-theft alarm system in 1990, a [[catalytic converter]] in 1991 (as required by law), as well as electronic [[Digifant]] [[fuel injection]], hydraulic valve lifters, and a spin-on oil filter in 1993. The front turn signals were located in the bumper instead of the Beetle's traditional placement on top of the front fenders from the 1977 model year on, as they had been on German Beetles sold in Europe from 1975 onwards. Starting in 1995, the Mexican Beetle included front disc brakes, an alternator instead of a generator, and front automatic seat belts. During the 1995 model year, the chrome moldings disappeared leaving body colored bumpers and black moldings instead on some models. By the start of the 1996 model year, exterior chrome or matt moldings were dropped altogether and Volkswagen de Mexico (VWdM) dropped the Sedan's flow-through ventilation system with all its fittings, notably the exterior crescent-shaped vents behind the rear side windows the same year.\n\nIn mid-1996, front drum brakes and fixed front seat belts were re-launched in a new budget version called the \"Volkswagen Sed\u00e1n City\", which was sold alongside the upscale version \"Volkswagen Sed\u00e1n Cl\u00e1sico\" which had front disc brakes, automatic seat belts, right side mirror, velour upholstery, optional metallic colors and wheel covers in matte finish (also found on some 1980s Beetles and Buses). These two versions were sold until mid 1998. From mid 1998\u20132003, The Sed\u00e1n Cl\u00e1sico was discontinued and the Sed\u00e1n City lost its prefix and gained disc brakes, automatic seat belts and optional metallic colors. This last version was named the \"Volkswagen Sed\u00e1n Unificado\" or simply the \"Volkswagen Sed\u00e1n\".\n\n[[File:Vochol09MAP.jpg|thumb|left| A Beetle decorated in the [[Huichol people|Huichol]] style of beading now on display at the [[Museo de Arte Popular]] in Mexico City]]\n\nIndependent importers continued to supply several major countries, including Germany, France, and the UK until the end of production in 2003.  Devoted fans of the car even discovered a way to circumvent US safety regulations by placing more recently manufactured Mexican Beetles on the [[floorpan]]s of earlier, US-registered cars. The Mexican Beetle (along with its Brazilian counterpart) was on the US DOT's (Department of Transportation) hot list of [[grey market]] imports after 1978 as the vehicle did not meet safety regulations.\n\nIn the Southwest US ([[Arizona]], California, [[New Mexico]], Texas), Mexican Beetles (and some [[Volkswagen Type 2 (T2)|Brazilian T2c Transporters]]) are a fairly common sight since Mexican nationals can legally operate the vehicle in the United States, provided the cars remain registered in Mexico. Some of the Mexican Beetles have been registered in the United States since the 1998 NHTSA amendment granting the 25-year cutoff where it (and its Brazilian counterpart including the T2C) can be legally registered in any of the 50 states (this means a 1992 or earlier Mexican Beetle as of 2017 can be registered under the current NHTSA 25-year cutoff exemption).\n\nThe end of production in Mexico can be attributed primarily to Mexican political measures: the Beetles no longer met [[emission standard]]s for Mexico City, in which the ubiquitous Beetles were used as taxicabs; and the government outlawed their use as taxicabs because of rising crime rates, requiring only four-door vehicles be used. The last Vocho taxis in Mexico City were retired at the end of 2012.<ref name=Hemmings>{{cite journal | title = Vochos No Mas | journal = Hemmings Sports & Exotic Car |date=June 2012 | last = Shea | first = Terry | page = 48 | issue = 10 | volume = 7 | publisher = [[Hemmings Motor News]] | location = Bennington, VT | issn = 1555-6867 }}</ref> In addition, Volkswagen (now Germany's largest automaker) has been attempting to cultivate a more upscale, premium brand image, and the humble Beetle clashed with this identity, as seen in the [[Volkswagen Touareg|Touareg]] and [[Volkswagen Passat|Passat]] luxury vehicles. In the late 1990s consumers strongly preferred more modern cars such as the [[Opel Corsa#Opel Corsa B|Mexican Chevy]], the [[Nissan Tsuru#B13 (1991\u20131994)|Nissan Tsuru]], and the [[Volkswagen Gol#Gol G2 to G4 (1994-2008)|Volkswagen Pointer]] and [[Volkswagen Fox|Lupo]].\n\nHowever, demand for the Beetle was relatively high, especially in the 1990s, with the workforce increasing at the start of the decade. The price of the base model (without even a radio) was pegged with the official minimum wage, by an agreement between the company and the government. In 1990 it cost US$5,300.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/1990/10/20/world/mexico-city-journal-miss-the-vw-bug-it-lives-beyond-the-rio-grande.html?pagewanted=all&src=pm | work=The New York Times | first=Mark A. | last=Uhlig | title=Mexico City Journal; Miss the VW Bug?

Volkswagen Australia was formed in 1957, and by 1960 locally produced body panels were being used for the first time. When the European Type One body received the larger windows for the 1965 model year, Volkswagen Australia decided not to update, but continued to produce the smaller-windowed bodies, with unique features to the Australian versions. This was due to the limited size of the market and the costs involved in retooling. Australian content had reached almost 95% by this time.<ref name=\"clubvw.org.au\">{{cite web|url=http://www.clubvw.org.au/history004 |title=1965 - 1969 - Club VeeDub |publisher=Clubvw.org.au |date= |accessdate=2016-07-10}}</ref> The Australian subsidiary continued to produce the earlier body style until 1967, when declining sales forced a switch to CKD assembly using imported components the following year. In 1968, Volkswagen Australia released its own locally designed utilitarian version of the Type 1, the [[Volkswagen Country Buggy]] or Type 197.\n\nThe last Australian-assembled Beetle was produced in July 1976 with assembly of other models ending in February 1977.<ref name=clubvw>[http://www.clubvw.org.au/austvw001 Australian Volkswagens,www.clubvw.org.au] Retrieved 25 March 2018</ref> All Volkswagens for the Australian market have been fully imported since then.<ref name=clubvw/>\n\n=== South Africa ===\n\nThe Beetle was also produced in South Africa at the Uitenhage plant from 31 August 1951 to 1979.  Several features from the Super Beetle were grafted onto the South African Beetle 1600S, such as curved windshield, new dashboard, and larger taillights, while retaining the Beetle chassis and mechanicals. The 1600 model was introduced to South Africa in 1972; it was marketed as the cheapest 1.6-liter car available there. In late 1976, the sporty SP 1600 Beetle arrived \u2013 this version received bright red, yellow, or silver paint with black stripes, a front spoiler, wide tyres, and a more powerful engine with twin carburettors and a freer flowing exhaust.<ref name=SAM1276>{{cite journal | ref = SAM1276 | journal = SA Motor | title = New VWs reflect determinedly cheerful mood | pages = 31\u201332 | last = Howard | first = Tony | publisher = Scott Publications | location = Cape Town, South Africa | date = December 1976 }}</ref> The interior was also sporty, with red tartan upholstery, a small steering wheel, and lots of matte black.

The car was then internally designated the Volkswagen Type 1, and marketed simply as the Volkswagen. Later models were designated Volkswagen 1200, 1300, 1500, 1302, or 1303, the former three indicating [[engine displacement]], the latter two derived from the model number. The car became widely known in its home country as the ''K\u00e4fer'' (German for \"[[beetle]]\", cognate with English [[Wikt:chafer|chafer]]) and was later marketed under that name in Germany,<ref name= samba-1973-de-super/> and as the Volkswagen in other countries. For example, in France it was known as the {{lang|fr|Coccinelle}}<!--was that an official VW model name or just a common nickname?--> (French for [[coccinellidae|ladybug]]).<ref name=\"samba-1970-ca-full\"/><ref name=\"samba-1970-us-super\"/> In 1943, [[Roy Fedden]] applied for a patent, [[https://worldwide.espacenet.com/patent/search/family/010067840/publication/GB570814A]] GB570814, 'Improvements relating to road vehicles', a car identical to VW K\u00e4fer.\n\nThe original 25&nbsp;hp Beetle was designed for a top speed around 100&nbsp;km/h (62&nbsp;mph), which would be a viable cruising speed on the ''[[Reichsautobahn]]'' system. As Autobahn speeds increased in the postwar years, its output was boosted to 36, then 40&nbsp;hp, the configuration that lasted through 1966 and became the \"classic\" Volkswagen motor. The Beetle gave rise to multiple variants: mainly the 1950 [[Volkswagen Type 2|Type 2 'Bus']], the 1955 [[Volkswagen Karmann Ghia|Karmann Ghia]], as well as the 1961 [[Volkswagen Type 3|Type 3 'Ponton']] and the 1968 [[Volkswagen Type 4|Type 4 (411/412)]] [[family car]]s, ultimately forming the basis of an entirely rear-engined VW product range. The Beetle thus marked a significant trend, led by Volkswagen, and then by [[Fiat]] and [[Renault]], whereby the [[rear-engine, rear-wheel-drive layout]] increased from 2.6&nbsp;percent of continental Western Europe's car production in 1946 to 26.6&nbsp;percent in 1956.<ref name=SmallCar196501>{{cite journal |authorlink= Laurence Pomeroy |title=BMC's Mini: The Background story: Part one: The Volkswagen cometh |journal=[[Car Magazine|Small Car]] |pages=42\u201347 |date=January 1965}}</ref> In 1959 even General Motors launched an air-cooled, rear-engined car, the [[Chevrolet Corvair]]\u2014which even shared the Beetle's flat engine and [[swing axle]] architecture.\n\nOver time, [[front-wheel drive]], and frequently [[hatchback]]-bodied cars would come to dominate the European small-car market. In 1974, Volkswagen's own front-wheel drive [[Volkswagen Golf|Golf]] hatchback succeeded the Beetle. In 1994, Volkswagen unveiled the [[Volkswagen New Beetle#History|Concept One]], a \"retro\"-themed [[concept car]] with a resemblance to the original Beetle, and in 1998 introduced the \"[[Volkswagen New Beetle|New Beetle]]\", built on the [[Volkswagen Golf Mk4|contemporary Golf]] platform with styling recalling the original Type 1.

The Japanese had refined rear-wheel-drive, water-cooled, front-engine, small cars including the [[Datsun 510]] and [[Toyota Corona]], whose sales in the North American market grew rapidly at the expense of Volkswagen in the late 1960s.  [[Honda]] introduced the [[Honda N360|N600]], based on the space-efficient transverse-engine, front-wheel-drive layout of the original [[Austin Mini]], to the North American market in late 1969, and upgraded the model to the [[Honda Civic]] in 1972.  The Japanese \"big three\" would soon dominate compact auto sales in North America.  In 1971 [[Ford]] introduced its [[Ford Pinto|Pinto]], which had some market impact as a low cost alternative in the wake of the [[Nixon shock|drop of the US Dollar against the Deutsche Mark]] that same year.  As the 1960s came to a close, Volkswagen faced increasingly stiff competition from European cars as well.  The Beetle was faced with competition from new designs like the [[Fiat 127]] and [[Renault 5]], and more robust designs based on the Austin Mini layout such as the [[supermini car|Superminis]]. German competitors, [[Ford]] and [[Opel]] also enjoyed strong sales of modern smaller cars like the [[Ford Escort (Europe)|Ford Escort]] and [[Opel Kadett]].  Volkswagen's attempts to boost the power of their air-cooled motor to meet the demands of higher highway speeds in the late 1960s, then comply with new pollution control regulations, caused problems for reliability and fuel efficiency that impaired the reputation of the aging design.  Safety issues with the Beetle came under increasing scrutiny, culminating in the 1972 release of a rather scathing report.<ref>{{cite book|author=Center for Auto Safety|title=Small on Safety:The designed-in dangers of the Volkswagen|date= 1972|isbn=978-0670652495}}</ref>  During the early 1970s, sales of the Beetle in Europe and North America plummeted.\n\nVW introduced other models to supplement the Beetle throughout the 1960s; the [[VW Type 3|Type 3]], [[VW Type 4|Type 4]], and the NSU-based and larger [[VW K70|K70]].  None of these models, aimed at more upscale markets, achieved the level of success of the Beetle. The over-reliance on a single model, now in decline, meant that Volkswagen was in financial crisis by 1974. It needed German government funding to produce the Beetle's replacement.\n\nProduction lines at Wolfsburg switched to the new water-cooled, front-engined, [[front-wheel-drive]] [[Volkswagen Golf|Golf]] designed by [[Giorgetto Giugiaro]] in 1974, sold in North America at the time as the \"Rabbit\".  The Golf eventually became Volkswagen's most successful model since the Beetle. It was periodically redesigned over its lifetime, with only a few components carried over between generations, entering its seventh generation in 2012; the Beetle had only minor refinements of its original design.\n\nThe Golf did not kill Beetle production, nor did the smaller [[Volkswagen Polo|Polo]] which was launched a year later. Production of the Beetle continued in smaller numbers at other German factories until 19 January 1978, when mainstream production shifted to Brazil and Mexico: markets where low operating cost was an important factor. After this shift in production, sales in Europe did not stop, but became very low. Beetle sedans were produced for U.S. markets until July 1977<ref name=\"TheSamba.com\">Beetle VIN / Chassis Numbers - TheSamba.com {{cite web|url=http://www.thesamba.com/vw/archives/info/bugchassisdating.php|title=Beetle VIN / Chassis Numbers - TheSamba.com}}</ref> and for European markets until 1985, with other companies continuing to import cars produced in Mexico after 1985. The Beetle convertible/Cabriolet ended production (as 1979 models) on January 31, 1980.<ref name=\"TheSamba.com\"/>\n\nThe last Beetle was produced in [[Puebla, Puebla|Puebla]], Mexico, in July 2003.<ref name=\"AutoMotoruSport200313\"/> The final batch of 3,000 Beetles were sold as 2004 models and badged as the ''\u00daltima Edici\u00f3n'', with [[whitewall tires]], a host of previously discontinued chrome trim, and the choice of two special paint colors taken from the [[New Beetle]]. Production in Brazil ended in 1986, then started again in 1993 and continued until 1996.\n\nThe Beetle outlasted most other cars which had adopted the rear-engine, air-cooled layout such as those by [[Subaru 360|Subaru]], [[Fiat]], and [[Chevrolet Corvair|General Motors]]. Porsche's 356 series which originally used some Volkswagen-sourced parts, continued to use the classic rear-engine layout (which later became water cooled) in the [[Porsche 911]] 996 series, which remains competitive in the third decade of the 21st century.\n\n=== Worldwide end of production ===\n[[File:Volkswagen Bubbla sista bilen.jpg|thumb|\"\u00daltima Edici\u00f3n\" (Final Edition) in Aquarius Blue (2003).]]\nBy 2002, over 21 million Type 1s had been produced, but by 2003, annual production had dropped to 30,000 from a peak of 1.3&nbsp;million in 1971.

An engine oil cooler (located in the engine fan's shroud) ensured optimal engine operating temperature and long engine life, optimized by a thermostat that bypassed the oil cooler when the engine was cold.

Subsequently, (beginning in 1967 in Europe and 1968 in the United States), VW offered an optional manumatic transmission (marketed as ''Automatic Stick Shift'' and also called ''[[AutoStick]]'',{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}) which was a 3-speed manual coupled to an [[electro-pneumatic]] clutch and torque converter.<ref name=\"autostick\">{{cite web | title = Volkswagen New Beetle History | publisher = Edmunds.com  | url = http://www.edmunds.com/volkswagen/new-beetle/history.html}}</ref>\n\nWhile the overall appearance of the Beetle changed little over its life span, it received over 78,000&nbsp;incremental changes during its production.<ref name=\"willson\"/>\n\n== Evolution and design changes ==\n\n=== Beetle cabriolet ===\n[[File:12-02-02-autostadt-wolfsburg-070.jpg|thumb|1960 VW 1200 Cabriolet]]\nIt was in 1948 that Wilhelm Karmann first bought a VW Beetle [[Sedan (automobile)|sedan]] and converted it into a four-seated [[convertible (car)|convertible]].  After successfully presenting it at VW in Wolfsburg the Beetle Cabriolet began production in 1949 by [[Karmann]] in [[Osnabr\u00fcck]].\n\nThe convertible was more than a Beetle with a folding top. To compensate for the strength lost in removing the roof, the sills were reinforced with welded U-channel rails, a transverse beam was fitted below the front edge of the rear seat cushion, and the side cowl-panels below the instrument panel were double-wall. In addition, the lower corners of the door apertures had welded-in curved gussets, and the doors had secondary alignment wedges at the B-pillar.\n\nThe top was cabriolet-style with a full inner headliner hiding the folding mechanism and crossbars. In between the two top layers was {{convert|1|in|mm|abbr=on}} of insulation. The rear window was tempered safety glass, and after 1968, heated. Due to the thickness of the top, it remained quite tall when folded. To enable the driver to see over the lowered top, the inside rearview was mounted on an offset pivot. By twisting the mirror 180 degrees on a longitudinal axis, the mirror glass would raise approximately {{convert|2|in|cm|abbr=on}}.\n\nThe convertible was generally more lavishly equipped than the sedan with dual rear ashtrays, twin map pockets, a visor vanity mirror on the passenger side, rear stone shields, and through 1969, wheel trim rings. Many of these items did not become available on other Beetles until the advent of the optional \"L\" (Luxus) Package of 1970.\n\nAfter a number of stylistic and technical alterations made to the Karmann cabriolet,<ref>{{cite web |author=Jon Gilbert |url=http://www.volksworld.com/news/cars/279437/1963-vw-beetle-cabriolet.html |title=volksworld.com |publisher=volksworld.com |date=2008-10-31 |accessdate=2012-01-15 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120809014310/http://www.volksworld.com/news/cars/279437/1963-vw-beetle-cabriolet.html |archive-date=9 August 2012 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref> (corresponding to the many changes VW made to the Beetle throughout its history), the last of 331,847 cabriolets came off the production line on 10 January 1980.\n\n===1950\u20131959 models===\n[[File:VW K\u00e4fer blue 1956 vr TCE.jpg|thumb|1956 Volkswagen Beetle]]\n\nDuring this period, a myriad of changes were made throughout the vehicle beginning with the availability of hydraulic brakes and a folding fabric sunroof in 1950.  The rear window of the VW Beetle evolved from a divided or \"split\" oval, to a singular oval. The change occurred between October 1952 and March 1953.<ref name=\"Ponchard\">{{cite journal|last=Ponchard|first=Nathan|title=Auction Action|journal=Unique Cars|date=27 February 2013|issue=347|page=22|url=http://www.uniquecarsmag.com.au|accessdate=5 March 2013}}</ref> Beetles built during this time were known as a \"Zwitter\", or \"hybrid\", as they used the split-window bodyshell with oval-model chrome trim, vent windows and dashboard.<ref name=\"Ponchard\" />\n\n1953 models received a redesigned instrument panel.  The one-piece \u201cPope's Nose\u201d combination license plate/brake light was replaced by a smaller flat-bottomed license plate light. The brake light function was transferred to new heart-shaped lamps located in the top of the taillight housings.<ref>{{cite book|  title=Vintage Volkswagens |  url=https://archive.org/details/vintagevolkswage00flat |  url-access=registration |publisher=Flat 4 Project/Chronicle Books| location=San Francisco| year=1985}}</ref>\n\nIn 1954, Volkswagen added {{convert|2|mm|in|abbr=on}} to the cylinder bore, increasing the [[engine displacement|displacement]] from 1,131 (1100)&nbsp;cc to 1,192 (1200)&nbsp;cc.<ref name=PracticalMotorist1961>{{cite journal|journal=Practical Motorist |volume = 7 | issue = 81  |title =Knowing your Volkswagen | page = 943|date=May 1961}}</ref> This coincided with upgrades to various key components including a redesign of the crankshaft. This increased power from {{convert|30|hp|kW PS|abbr=on}} to {{convert|36|hp|kW PS|abbr=on}} and improved the engine's free revving abilities without compromising torque at lower engine speeds.<ref name=PracticalMotorist1961/> At the same time, compression ratios were progressively raised as, little by little, the octane ratings of available fuel was raised in major markets during the 1950s and 1960s.<ref name=PracticalMotorist1961/>\n\nIn 1955, the separate brake lights were discontinued and were combined into a new larger taillight housing.  The traditional VW semaphore turn signals were replaced by conventional flashing directional indicator lamps for North America.\n\nFor 1956, the Beetle received what would become one of its more distinctive features, a set of twin chrome tailpipes. Models for North America gained taller bumper guards and tubular overrider bars.\n\nFor 1958, the Beetle received a revised instrument panel, and a larger rectangular rear window replaced the previous oval design.\n\n===1960\u20131969 models===\n\n1960 models received a front [[sway bar|anti roll bar]] along with hydraulic [[steering damper]].\n\nFor 1961, significant technical advances occurred in the form of a new engine and transmission. The engine remained at {{cvt|1192|cc|L CID|1|abbr=on}} but the power increased to {{convert|40|bhp|PS kW|abbr=on}} at 3900 rpm and {{convert|88|Nm|lbft|abbr=on}} at 2400 rpm of [[Torque#Machine torque|torque]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.conceptcarz.com/s7533/Volkswagen-Beetle.aspx|website=conceptcarz|title=1963 Volkswagen Beetle Technical Specifications and Dimensions|accessdate=July 1, 2018}}</ref> primarily due to an increase in [[compression ratio]] to 7.1:1. The single-barrel [[Solex]] [[carburetor]] received an electric automatic choke and the transmission was now [[Manual transmission#Synchromesh|synchronized]] on all forward gears. The traditional semaphore turn signals were replaced by conventional flashing directional indicators worldwide. The standard model called the TYPE 111-112, continued to use the 36&nbsp;hp 1200 engine of the old architecture that dates back to Franz Reimspiess original design of 1937 all the way until the end of the 1965 model year. 1965 standard model in 1965 is called the \"A\" sedan.\n\nFor 1962, the Beetle received a mechanical fuel level gauge in place of the former fuel tap. The Standard model continued without a gas gauge until the end of the 1965 model year. At the rear, larger tail lights were introduced incorporating a separate amber turn signal section to meet new European standards (these turn signals remained red in the US market until 1973). The former hand-pump style windscreen washer was replaced by a new design using compressed air. A [[Schrader valve]] located on the washer fluid tank allowed the system to be charged at a filling station to the recommended {{convert|35|psi|bar|abbr=on}}.<ref>{{Cite book | title = The Beetle: The Chronicles of the People's Car| author=H.R. Etzold| publisher = Haynes Publishing Group |date= 1988 | page = 77 }}</ref>\n\n1964 models could be identified by a widened light housing on the engine lid over the rear license plate, however the standard model continued to use the old teardrop style to the end of the 1965 model run.\n\nThe largest change to date for the Beetle was in 1965: the majority of the body stampings were revised, which allowed for significantly larger windows. The windshield increased in area by 11% and was now slightly curved, rather than flat. Door windows increased accordingly by 6% (and door vent window edges were canted slightly back), rear side windows 17.5%, and the rear window 19.5%. The result was a more open, airy, modern look.<ref name=\"Small Wonder\">{{Cite book | title = Small Wonder| author=Walter Henry Nelson| publisher = Little, Brown and Co. |date= 1970 | page = 308 }}</ref>\n\nFor 1966, the big news was an optional new 1300cc {{convert|50|hp|kW PS|abbr=on}} engine in lieu of the previous 1200cc engine that had been the sole engine since 1954. Models so equipped carried a \"1300\" badge on the engine lid. The 1300cc engine was standard for North America.\n\nFor 1967, a yet-again larger-[[engine displacement|displacement]] engine was made available: [[Volkswagen air-cooled engine|1500cc]], {{convert|53|hp|kW PS|abbr=on}} at 4,200&nbsp;rpm.<ref name=\"TAM67\">{{Cite book | title = Quattroruote Speciale: Tutte le Auto del Mondo 1967 | publisher = Editoriale Domus S.p.A |date=February 1967 | language = Italian | pages = 296\u2013298 | location = Milano }}</ref> 1200 and 1300 engines continued to be available, as many markets based their taxation on engine size.<ref name=\"TAM67\"/> 1500cc Beetles were equipped with front disc brakes and were identified with a \"VW 1500\" badge on the engine lid. North America received the 1500 engine as standard equipment, but did not receive front disc brakes. These models were identified by a \"Volkswagen\" badge on the engine lid.\n\nThe rear suspension was significantly revised and included a widened track, softer torsion bars and the addition of a unique ''Z-configuration'' equalizing torsion spring. On US, UK and Ireland models, the generator output was increased from 180 to 360&nbsp;watts, and the entire electrical system was upgraded from 6 volts to 12 volts. The clutch disc also increased in size and changes were made to the [[flywheel]]. New equipment included a driver's armrest on the door and locking buttons on both doors. Safety improvements included two-speed [[windscreen wiper]]s, reversing lights (in some markets), and a driver's side mirror. In accord with the newly enacted US [[Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard 108]], North American models received a dual-circuit brake system, the clear glass [[headlamp]] covers were deleted; the headlamps were brought forward to the leading edge of the front fenders, and the sealed-beam units were exposed and surrounded by chrome bezels. In the rest of the world markets the 1967 model retained the older headlights. Another oddity of the 1967 North American market Beetle is the rear bumper overriders (towel rails) \u2013 the overriders have a different shape than the older models besides the one-year only engine decklid.{{clarify|reason=what does the end of this sentence (from \"besides\") mean?|date=October 2018}} The Brazilian market model (Volkswagen Fusca) retained the pre-1967 headlamps until 1972.{{Citation needed|reason=Entire paragraph needs a source, please|date=October 2018}}\n\n[[File:'68 VW 1500.jpg|thumb|1968 Type 1]]\n1968 was a year of major change. The most noticeable of which were the new larger, higher mounted C-section bumpers. At the rear, new larger taillamps were adopted and were able to accommodate reversing lamps, which were previously separate bumper-mounted units. Beetles worldwide received the '67 North American style vertical headlamp placement, but with replaceable-bulb headlamps compliant with [[ECE regulations]] rather than the US sealed beams. Other improvements were a new outside gas filler with spring-loaded flap, eliminating the need to open the trunk to refuel. The fuel gauge was integrated with the speedometer and was now electrically actuated rather than cable-operated. The windscreen washer was now pressured by the spare tire, which was to be maintained at a pressure of {{convert|42|psi|bar|abbr=on}}. A pressure valve in the connecting hose closed airflow to the fluid reservoir if spare tire pressure fell below {{convert|30|psi|bar|abbr=on}}, which was above the recommended pressures for the road tires.<ref>\">{{Cite book | title = The Beetle:  The Chronicles of the People's Car| author=H.R. Etzold| publisher = Haynes Publishing Group |date= 1988 | page = 123 }}</ref> A ventilation system was introduced, which drew fresh air into the cabin from louvres on the front decklid.  For improved shifting, the shift lever was shortened, stiffened and moved rearward by {{convert|78|mm|in|abbr=on}}.\n\nA number of safety improvements were made in order to comply with new American safety regulations: these included trigger-operated outside door handles, a secondary front hood latch, collapsing steering column, soft vent window latches, rotary glove compartment latch and instrument panel knobs labeled with [[pictographs]]. US models received a padded instrument panel that was optional in other markets. To meet North American head restraint requirements, VW developed the industry's first high-back bucket seat.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}} The Standard model 111-112, called the 1200 \"A\" still used the 1200 engine but for the first time for Europe it came with a 12 volt system.\n\n[[File:'68 Volkswagen AutoStick Badge.jpg|thumb|'68\u2013'69 Automatic ''StickShift'' badge]]\n\nA new 3-speed [[manumatic]] gear box with [[torque converter]] and vacuum-operated clutch became available mid-production year. The manumatic models received a vastly improved [[Trailing arm|semi-trailing-arm]] rear suspension (also known as \"independent rear suspension\" although the earlier swing axle Beetles were also [[Suspension (vehicle)#Independent suspension|independent]]) and eliminated the need for the equalizing torsion spring. This new rear suspension layout would eventually become an option on later models. Beetles equipped with the automatic were identified with a \"VW Automatic\" badge on the engine lid and a matching decal in the rear window. In North America, the badging and decal were later revised to read, \"Automatic ''Stick Shift''\".\n\nFor 1969, the only exterior change was the fuel filler flap no longer had a finger indentation due to a new interior-mounted fuel door release. For North America, the Beetle received a heated rear window, day/night mirror and the semi-trailing, independent suspension with double jointed swing axles as standard equipment. In other markets, manual transmission models retained a swing axle independent suspension which would continue until the end of German Beetle production.\n\n===1970\u20131979 models===\nIn 1970, a new \"L\" (Luxus) Package was introduced including, among other items, twin map pockets, dual rear ashtrays, full carpeting, a passenger-side visor vanity mirror, and rubber bumper moldings. The optional 1500&nbsp;cc engine now came with an engine lid having two rows of cooling louvers, while the convertible's engine lid gained two additional sets for a total of four. For North America, the 1500&nbsp;cc engine was enlarged to 1600&nbsp;cc engine and produced {{convert|57|hp|kW PS|abbr=on}}\n\nThere were two Beetles for the first time in 1971, the familiar standard Beetle and a new, larger version, different from the windscreen forward. All Beetles received an engine upgrade: the optional 1500 cc engine was replaced by a 1600 cc with twin-port cylinder heads and a larger, relocated oil cooler. The new engine produced {{convert|60|hp|kW PS|abbr=on}}. The ventilation system was improved with the original dash-top vents augmented by a second pair aimed directly at the driver and passenger. For the first time the system was a flow-through design with crescent-shaped air exits fitted behind the rear quarter windows. Airflow could be increased via an optional 2-speed fan. The standard Beetle was now badged as the VW 1300; when equipped with the 1600 engine, it was badged 1300 S, to avoided confusion with the Type 3, which wore VW 1600 badges.\n\n{{Multiple image\n| align = \n| direction = vertical\n| total_width = 230\n| image1 = D\u00fclmen, Kirchspiel, VW 1303 -- 2017 -- 2279.jpg\n| alt1 = \n| caption1 = Beetle 1303 Cabriolet\n| image2 = M\u00fcnster, Volkswagen 1303 Cabrio -- 2018 -- 2475.jpg\n| caption2 = Detail\n}}\n\nThe new, larger Beetle was sold as the 1302/1302 S, offering nearly 43% more luggage capacity, up from 140 liters in front to 260 (remaining at 140 in back)<ref name=\"The Beetle: The Chronicles of the People's Car.\">{{Cite book | title = The Beetle:  The Chronicles of the Peoples' Car | author= Volkswagen of America| publisher = Haynes Publishing. |date= 1988 | pages = 140}}</ref> A new [[MacPherson strut]] front suspension was incorporated, similar to what was used in the Type 4, and the front track was widened. The new suspension layout allowed the spare tire to be positioned flat under the trunk floor. Although the car had to be lengthened slightly to accomplish this, it allowed a reduction in turning radius. To gain additional trunk volume, the under-dash panel{{clarify|date=May 2017|what is that, exactly?}} was lowered, allowing the fuel tank to be shifted rearward. From the windscreen back the big Beetle was identical to its smaller progenitor, except for having the also new [[trailing-arm suspension|semi-trailing arm]] rear suspension as standard equipment. Overall, the bigger Beetle was {{convert|50|mm|in|abbr=on}} longer, {{convert|35|mm|in|abbr=on}} wider, and rode on a {{convert|20|mm|in|abbr=on}}-longer wheelbase. Both Beetles were available with or without the L Package. The convertible was now based on the 1302 body. In North America, the 1302 was marketed as the Super Beetle and came only with the L Package and 1600 cc engine. While it lacked the front disc brakes that normally accompanied the larger motor, it was fitted with brake drums that were slightly larger than the standard Beetle. With the Super Beetle being sold as the premium model in North America, the standard Beetle, while retaining the same 1600 cc engine, was stripped of many of its earlier features in order to reduce the selling price. Bright window and running board moldings disappeared, along with the day/night mirror, horn ring, map pocket, locking glove box and miscellaneous other items.\n\n1972 models had an 11% larger rear window ({{convert|40|mm|in|abbr=on|disp=sqbr}} taller), and the convertible engine lid with four rows of louvres was now used on all Beetles. Inside the vehicle, a four-spoke energy-absorbing steering wheel was introduced, the windshield wiper/washer knob was replaced in favor of a steering column stalk, and intermittent wipers were a new option available in selected markets. An engine compartment socket for the proprietary VW Diagnosis system was also introduced. The rear luggage area was fitted with a folding parcel shelf. A limited-edition Commemorative model was launched in celebration of the Beetle's passing the record of the Ford Model T as the world's most-produced automobile.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sebeetles.com/marathon/ |title=1972 Marathon Beetle - All the VW Beetle Special Editions |publisher=SE Beetles |date=2016-05-20 |accessdate=2016-07-10}}</ref> The Commemorative Beetle was a 1302 S finished in a special Marathon Blue Metallic paint and unique 4.5 x 15 styled steel wheels. In the U.S., it was marketed as the Super Beetle Baja Champion SE.\n \n[[File:Volkswagen Beetle .jpg|thumb|1973 1303/Super Beetle]]\n[[File:1973-1974 Volkswagen \"1303 Big\", Istanbul.jpg|left|thumb|1973\u201374 1303/Super Beetle \"Big\"]]\n\n1973 models featured significantly enlarged \"elephant foot\" taillamps mounted in reshaped rear fenders. In the engine bay, the oil-bath air cleaner gave way to a dry element filter, and the generator was replaced with an alternator. The 1302/Super became the 1303 with a new taller wrap-around windscreen. The changes to the cowl and windshield resulted in slight redesign of the front hood. The instrument panel, formerly shared with the standard Beetle, was all-new and incorporated a raised speedometer pod, rocker-style switches and side-window defrosters.  The limited-edition GSR (Gelb-Schwarzer Renner; German for \"Yellow-Black Racer\") was a 1303 S available only in Saturn Yellow paint equipped with special {{convert|5.5|in|mm|abbr=on}} wide sport wheels fitted with 175/70-15 Pirelli Cinturato CN36 high-performance radial tires. Front and rear deck lids were finished in matte black, as was all exterior trim with the exception of the chrome headlamp bezels. Inside were [[corduroy]] and leatherette high-bolstered sport seats and a small diameter three-spoke steering wheel with padded leather rim and a small red VW logo on the bottom spoke. In North America, the GSR was sold as the Super Beetle Sports Bug. The North American model had body-color deck lids and was available in Marathon Blue Metallic in addition to Saturn Yellow. In some markets, the sport wheels (in both 4.5-inch and 5.5-inch widths), sport steering wheel and sport seats became available as stand-alone options.\n\nFor 1974, North American models received newly required {{convert|5|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} impact bumpers mounted on self-restoring energy absorbers, which added approximately {{convert|25|mm|in|abbr=on}} to the car's overall length. On the Super Beetle, the steering knuckle, and consequently the lower attachment point of the strut, was redesigned to improve handling and stability in the event of a tire blowout. A limited-edition Big Beetle was introduced based on the 1303 LS. Available in unique metallic paint colors, the car featured styled-steel {{convert|5.5|in|mm|abbr=on}} wide sport wheels wrapped in 175/70-15 tires, corduroy seat inserts, upgraded loop-pile carpet, wood-look instrument panel trim and a padded steering wheel with bright accents. In the North American market, a limited-edition Sun Bug was introduced as a standard Beetle or Super Beetle. Both were finished in metallic gold and featured styled-steel {{convert|4.5|in|mm|abbr=on}}-wide sport wheels. Inside were brown corduroy and leatherette seats, loop-pile carpet, and padded four-spoke deluxe steering wheel. The Super Beetle Sun Bug included a sliding-steel sunroof. Mid-year, the Love Bug was introduced for North America: based on the standard Beetle, it was available only in Phoenix Red or Ravenna Green (both colors shared with the [[Porsche 914|VW-Porsche 914]]) with all exterior trim finished in matte black. A price leader, the Love Bug retailed for less than a standard Beetle.\n\nIn 1975, front turn indicators were moved from the top of the front fenders down into the bumper. At the rear, the license plate light housing was now molded of plastic with a ribbed top surface. To comply with tightening emission standards, the 1600 cc engine in Japanese and North American markets received Bosch [[Jetronic#L|L-Jetronic]] fuel injection, rather than the [[Jetronic#D|D-Jetronic]] system formerly used in the VW Type 3 and Type 4. The injected engine received a new muffler and in California a catalytic converter. This necessitated a bulge in the rear apron under the rear bumper and replaced the distinctive twin \"pea shooter\" tailpipes with a single offset pipe, making injected models identifiable at a glance.  {{convert|5|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} bumper-equipped North American models retained fender-top front indicators. The 1303 received rack and pinion steering. In North America, the 1303/Super Beetle sedan was moved upmarket and was now christened La Grande Bug. Similar to the Big Beetle of 1974, La Grande Bug was available in blue or green metallic paint in the U.S. and blue, green or gold metallic in Canada and was equipped with the same features as the 1974 Sun Bug. The \"Volkswagen\" script on the engine lid of all North American Beetles was replaced with a \"Fuel Injection\" badge.\n\nIn 1976, the 1303/La Grande Bug was discontinued, with the larger body continuing only in convertible form. To make up for the loss in North American markets, the standard Beetle was upgraded, regaining some of the features that were removed in 1971. In addition, the 2-speed ventilation fan was included, previously available in North America only on the larger Beetle. The automatic stickshift option was discontinued as well.\n\n1977 models received new front seats with separate head restraints.  This was the final model year for the Beetle sedan in North America. The convertible was offered in a \"triple white\" Champagne Edition in Alpine White with  white top and interior with the padded deluxe steering wheel, tiger maple wood-grain dash trim and {{convert|4.5|in|mm|abbr=on}} wide sport wheels. Approximately 1,000 Champagne Editions were produced.\n\nFor 1978, a new Champagne 2nd Edition convertible was launched, available in blue or red metallic paint with white leatherette interior. Features included the {{convert|4.5|in|mm|abbr=on}} wide styled steel sport wheels, AM/FM radio, analog [[quartz clock]], padded deluxe steering wheel and rosewood-grain instrument panel trim. Approximately 1,100 were produced.\n\nIn 1979, VW offered an Epilogue Edition of the convertible in triple black with features similar to the 1978 Champagne Edition. This would be the last year of convertible production worldwide as well as the final year for the Beetle in the USA and Canada.\n\n== Introduction to international markets ==\n\n===Ireland ===\n{{Main|History of Volkswagen in Ireland}}\n\nVolkswagen began its involvement in Ireland when in 1949, Motor Distributors Limited, founded by Stephen O'Flaherty secured the [[franchising|franchise]] for the country at that year\u2019s [[Paris Motor Show]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.tribune.ie/archive/article/2003/sep/14/motor-moguls-facing-end-of-an-era/ |title=Motor moguls facing end of an era |author=Brian Carey |newspaper=[[Sunday Tribune]] |date=14 September 2003 |accessdate=6 November 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160310065902/http://tribune.ie/archive/article/2003/sep/14/motor-moguls-facing-end-of-an-era |archivedate=10 March 2016 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.independent.ie/business/the-motor-moguls-955766.html|title=The Motor Moguls|work=[[Irish Independent]]|date=5 July 2007|accessdate=6 November 2009}}</ref> In 1950, Volkswagen Beetles started arriving into [[Dublin]] packed in crates in what was termed \"[[knockdown kit|completely knocked down]]\" (CKD) form ready to be assembled.

Its exterior dimensions and engine displacement were in compliance with Japanese Government [[Vehicle size class#Japan|regulations]], which helped sales. Several Japanese vehicles were introduced after the Beetle was sold in Japan, using an air-cooled engine and rear mounting of the engine, such as the [[Subaru 360]], or an engine installed in the front, like the [[Honda N360]], the [[Suzuki Fronte]], and the [[Mitsubishi Minica]].\n\n=== Vietnam ===\n\nNguyen Hoang Hiep, vice chairman of the National Traffic Safety Committee, reported in 2014 that there were 2.1 million vehicles registered in Vietnam.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Nguyen|first1=Quang Thong|title=Vietnam sees faster-than-expected growth of motorbikes|url=http://www.thanhniennews.com/society/vietnam-sees-fasterthanexpected-growth-of-motorbikes-24223.html|publisher=Thanh Nien|accessdate=22 September 2016|ref=Vietnam}}</ref> Volkswagen vehicles have been sold in Vietnam through World Auto since 2007 with an average of 100 units sold each year.<ref>{{cite web|title=Will Volkswagen assemble cars in Vietnam?|url=http://english.vietnamnet.vn/fms/business/143385/will-volkswagen-assemble-cars-in-vietnam-.html|website=Vietnam Net Bridge|publisher=VIETNAMNET Bridge|accessdate=22 September 2016}}</ref>\n\n== International production ==\nGerman production of the Beetle took place initially at the parent Wolfsburg plant until the Golf's introduction in 1974, later expanding to the newer Emden and Hanover plants.

The last German made cars were assembled at Emden in 1978, after which the Puebla, Mexico plant became the principal source of Beetle production.

In 1993 production resumed and continued to 1996. The Brazilian version retained the 1958\u201364 body style (Europe and U.S. version) with the thick door pillars and smaller side windows. This body style was also produced in Mexico until 1971. Around 1973, all Brazilian Beetles (1300 and 1500 series) were updated with the 1968-up sheet metal, bumpers, and four-lug rims; although the five-stud rims and \"bugeye\" headlights were produced as late as 1972 (the base VW 1200 and 1300 manufactured in Brazil was similar to the 1964 European/U.S. 1200 until the 1970 model year but came with vented wheels since the mid-1960s). The 1971 and 1972 1300s had the 1964-era taillights and headlights, fuel tank, but fitted with the 1968-up raised bumpers. Brazilian CKD kits were shipped to Nigeria between 1975 and 1987 where Beetles were locally assembled. The Brazilian-produced versions have been sold in neighboring South American nations bordering Brazil, including Argentina, Uruguay, and Peru.\n\nThe Brazilian Type 1s have four different engines: 1,200&nbsp;cc, 1,300&nbsp;cc, 1,500&nbsp;cc, and 1,600&nbsp;cc. In the 1970s, Volkswagen made the SP-2 (derived from the Type 1 pan and the Type 3 powertrain) with a 1,700&nbsp;cc engine (a [[cylinder bore|bored-out]] 1,600&nbsp;cc). In Brazil, the Type 1 never received electronic fuel injection, instead retaining carburetors (one or two one-barrels) throughout its entire life, although the carburetion differs from engines of different years and specification.\n\nThe production of the air-cooled engine finally ended in 2006, after more than 60 years.  It was last used in the Brazilian version of the [[Volkswagen Type 2|VW Bus]], called the \"Kombi\", and was replaced by a 1.4&nbsp;L water-cooled engine with a front-mounted cooling system. [[Volkswagen do Brasil]] engaged in some string pulling in the early sixties when a law requiring taxis to have four doors and five seats was being considered. After proving that the average taxi fare only carried 1.8 passengers and an overall saving of twenty percent for a smaller two-door car, the Brazilian government relented and the law never entered the books.<ref name=Stern137>[[#stern|''VW-Tochter: Erfolg mit Fusca'']], p. 137</ref> The Fusca proceeded to have a long career as a taxi in urban Brazil.\n\n=== Southern Rhodesia ===\nThe Volkswagen Type 1 chassis was used as the basis for a mine-protected [[armoured personnel carrier|APC]] called the [[Leopard security vehicle]] and the [[Pookie (vehicle)|Pookie]] demining vehicle, fielded by the Republic of Rhodesia during the [[Rhodesian Bush War]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}\n\n=== Mexico ===\n[[File:Sedan Jeans.jpg|thumb|1995 Mexican Volkswagen Beetle, the last model with chrome moldings. In the picture, the 1995 Jeans Limited Edition.]]\n[[File:Volkswagen Bubbla sista bilen.jpg|thumb|The very last Volkswagen Beetle produced, manufactured in Puebla, Mexico, July 30, 2003.]]\n{{Main|Volkswagen Beetle in Mexico}}\nMexican production began in 1955 because of agreements with companies such as [[Chrysler]] in Mexico and the [[Studebaker-Packard Corporation]] which assembled cars imported in CKD form. In 1964, they began to be locally produced.  These models have the larger windshield, rear window, door and quarter glass starting in 1972; and the rear window from 1965 to 1971 German built models was used on the Mexican models from 1972 to 1985, when it was replaced with the larger rear window used on 1972 and later German built Beetles. This version, after the mid-1970s, saw little change with the incorporation of electronic ignition in 1988, an anti-theft alarm system in 1990, a [[catalytic converter]] in 1991 (as required by law), as well as electronic [[Digifant]] [[fuel injection]], hydraulic valve lifters, and a spin-on oil filter in 1993. The front turn signals were located in the bumper instead of the Beetle's traditional placement on top of the front fenders from the 1977 model year on, as they had been on German Beetles sold in Europe from 1975 onwards. Starting in 1995, the Mexican Beetle included front disc brakes, an alternator instead of a generator, and front automatic seat belts. During the 1995 model year, the chrome moldings disappeared leaving body colored bumpers and black moldings instead on some models. By the start of the 1996 model year, exterior chrome or matt moldings were dropped altogether and Volkswagen de Mexico (VWdM) dropped the Sedan's flow-through ventilation system with all its fittings, notably the exterior crescent-shaped vents behind the rear side windows the same year.\n\nIn mid-1996, front drum brakes and fixed front seat belts were re-launched in a new budget version called the \"Volkswagen Sed\u00e1n City\", which was sold alongside the upscale version \"Volkswagen Sed\u00e1n Cl\u00e1sico\" which had front disc brakes, automatic seat belts, right side mirror, velour upholstery, optional metallic colors and wheel covers in matte finish (also found on some 1980s Beetles and Buses). These two versions were sold until mid 1998. From mid 1998\u20132003, The Sed\u00e1n Cl\u00e1sico was discontinued and the Sed\u00e1n City lost its prefix and gained disc brakes, automatic seat belts and optional metallic colors. This last version was named the \"Volkswagen Sed\u00e1n Unificado\" or simply the \"Volkswagen Sed\u00e1n\".\n\n[[File:Vochol09MAP.jpg|thumb|left| A Beetle decorated in the [[Huichol people|Huichol]] style of beading now on display at the [[Museo de Arte Popular]] in Mexico City]]\n\nIndependent importers continued to supply several major countries, including Germany, France, and the UK until the end of production in 2003.  Devoted fans of the car even discovered a way to circumvent US safety regulations by placing more recently manufactured Mexican Beetles on the [[floorpan]]s of earlier, US-registered cars. The Mexican Beetle (along with its Brazilian counterpart) was on the US DOT's (Department of Transportation) hot list of [[grey market]] imports after 1978 as the vehicle did not meet safety regulations.\n\nIn the Southwest US ([[Arizona]], California, [[New Mexico]], Texas), Mexican Beetles (and some [[Volkswagen Type 2 (T2)|Brazilian T2c Transporters]]) are a fairly common sight since Mexican nationals can legally operate the vehicle in the United States, provided the cars remain registered in Mexico. Some of the Mexican Beetles have been registered in the United States since the 1998 NHTSA amendment granting the 25-year cutoff where it (and its Brazilian counterpart including the T2C) can be legally registered in any of the 50 states (this means a 1992 or earlier Mexican Beetle as of 2017 can be registered under the current NHTSA 25-year cutoff exemption).\n\nThe end of production in Mexico can be attributed primarily to Mexican political measures: the Beetles no longer met [[emission standard]]s for Mexico City, in which the ubiquitous Beetles were used as taxicabs; and the government outlawed their use as taxicabs because of rising crime rates, requiring only four-door vehicles be used. The last Vocho taxis in Mexico City were retired at the end of 2012.<ref name=Hemmings>{{cite journal | title = Vochos No Mas | journal = Hemmings Sports & Exotic Car |date=June 2012 | last = Shea | first = Terry | page = 48 | issue = 10 | volume = 7 | publisher = [[Hemmings Motor News]] | location = Bennington, VT | issn = 1555-6867 }}</ref> In addition, Volkswagen (now Germany's largest automaker) has been attempting to cultivate a more upscale, premium brand image, and the humble Beetle clashed with this identity, as seen in the [[Volkswagen Touareg|Touareg]] and [[Volkswagen Passat|Passat]] luxury vehicles. In the late 1990s consumers strongly preferred more modern cars such as the [[Opel Corsa#Opel Corsa B|Mexican Chevy]], the [[Nissan Tsuru#B13 (1991\u20131994)|Nissan Tsuru]], and the [[Volkswagen Gol#Gol G2 to G4 (1994-2008)|Volkswagen Pointer]] and [[Volkswagen Fox|Lupo]].\n\nHowever, demand for the Beetle was relatively high, especially in the 1990s, with the workforce increasing at the start of the decade. The price of the base model (without even a radio) was pegged with the official minimum wage, by an agreement between the company and the government. In 1990 it cost US$5,300.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/1990/10/20/world/mexico-city-journal-miss-the-vw-bug-it-lives-beyond-the-rio-grande.html?pagewanted=all&src=pm | work=The New York Times | first=Mark A. | last=Uhlig | title=Mexico City Journal; Miss the VW Bug?

Volkswagen Australia was formed in 1957, and by 1960 locally produced body panels were being used for the first time. When the European Type One body received the larger windows for the 1965 model year, Volkswagen Australia decided not to update, but continued to produce the smaller-windowed bodies, with unique features to the Australian versions. This was due to the limited size of the market and the costs involved in retooling. Australian content had reached almost 95% by this time.<ref name=\"clubvw.org.au\">{{cite web|url=http://www.clubvw.org.au/history004 |title=1965 - 1969 - Club VeeDub |publisher=Clubvw.org.au |date= |accessdate=2016-07-10}}</ref> The Australian subsidiary continued to produce the earlier body style until 1967, when declining sales forced a switch to CKD assembly using imported components the following year. In 1968, Volkswagen Australia released its own locally designed utilitarian version of the Type 1, the [[Volkswagen Country Buggy]] or Type 197.\n\nThe last Australian-assembled Beetle was produced in July 1976 with assembly of other models ending in February 1977.<ref name=clubvw>[http://www.clubvw.org.au/austvw001 Australian Volkswagens,www.clubvw.org.au] Retrieved 25 March 2018</ref> All Volkswagens for the Australian market have been fully imported since then.<ref name=clubvw/>\n\n=== South Africa ===\n\nThe Beetle was also produced in South Africa at the Uitenhage plant from 31 August 1951 to 1979.  Several features from the Super Beetle were grafted onto the South African Beetle 1600S, such as curved windshield, new dashboard, and larger taillights, while retaining the Beetle chassis and mechanicals. The 1600 model was introduced to South Africa in 1972; it was marketed as the cheapest 1.6-liter car available there. In late 1976, the sporty SP 1600 Beetle arrived \u2013 this version received bright red, yellow, or silver paint with black stripes, a front spoiler, wide tyres, and a more powerful engine with twin carburettors and a freer flowing exhaust.<ref name=SAM1276>{{cite journal | ref = SAM1276 | journal = SA Motor | title = New VWs reflect determinedly cheerful mood | pages = 31\u201332 | last = Howard | first = Tony | publisher = Scott Publications | location = Cape Town, South Africa | date = December 1976 }}</ref> The interior was also sporty, with red tartan upholstery, a small steering wheel, and lots of matte black.

The vehicles were entered in such famous races as TAP (Portugal), Austrian Alpine, Elba, Acropolis etc. Drivers were top performers such as [[Tony Fall]] (GB), Guenter Janger (AUT), [[Harry K\u00e4llstr\u00f6m]] (S), [[Achim Warmbold]] (D), Franz Wurz (A), etc. The engines were highly modified 1600s delivering {{convert|125|hp|abbr=on}}, later on mated to a Porsche 914 five-speed manual gearbox. Victories were achieved in 1973 on Elba for overall and class, Acropolis for class (5th overall), Austrian championship 1972, 1973 January Rallye for overall and class. Rally of 1000 minutes for overall 2nd (1st in class).\n\nThe fuel crisis, along with the arrival of the [[Volkswagen Golf]] (Rabbit), put an end to the days of unofficially supported rallying in 1974. All vehicles either used for training or actual racing were sold off to privateers, many kept racing with noticeable results until the early 1980s.\n\n=== Trans-Am Series ===\n\nBeetles were used in the [[Trans-Am Series]] for the two-litre class from 1966 to 1967 and again in 1972.\n\n===Armstrong 500===\nA Volkswagen won its class in the [[Armstrong 500]] in [[Australia]] in both [[1962 Armstrong 500|1962]] and [[1963 Armstrong 500|1963]].\n\n=== Baja 1000 ===\n[[File:Baja Bug.jpg|thumb|[[Baja Bug]]-style modified Beetle]]\nThe [[Baja 1000]] [[off-road racing|off-road race]] in the [[Baja California Peninsula]], Mexico includes specific vehicle classes for both standard Beetles and [[Baja Bug]]s. These can be seen in the documentary movie ''[[Dust to Glory]]''.\n\nThe classes are:\n*[[SCORE Class 5|Class 5]]: Unlimited Baja Bugs\n*[[SCORE Class 5-1600|Class 5-1600]]: 1,600 cc Baja Bugs\n*[[SCORE Class 11|Class 11]]: Stock VW sedans\n\n=== Beetle Challenge ===\n\nThe Beetle Challenge is a UK-based circuit racing championship for classic air-cooled Volkswagen Beetles. The general concept is to take any Beetle, of any age or model from the 40s through to 1303s, and with minimal restrictions, allowing parts from various years to be interchanged, and of course the cars being prepared to the MSA safety requirements (cage, restraints, fire system etc.) Essentially the cars must be air-cooled Beetles (any age and parts can be swapped between years and models), with a 15-inch x 6-inch max wheel size with a control tyre. Engines must be based on a Type 1 case, with no electronic fuel injection or ignition and no forced induction, with an unlimited capacity. Other regulations apply.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.beetlechallenge.com |title=Beetle Challenge |publisher=Beetle Challenge |accessdate=30 September 2010}}</ref>\n\n== Retrofit program ==\nVolkswagen has joined up with eClassics to allow beetle owners to convert their car to electric.\nThe battery will have a total capacity of 36.8 kWh, which should be good for around 200 kilometers of range. It reaches a top speed of 150 km/h and charging for an hour allows to store enough energy for a journey of over 150 km.<ref>[https://www.volkswagen-newsroom.com/en/press-releases/premiere-new-energy-for-the-beetle-5312 Premiere:\nNew energy for the Beetle]</ref><ref>[https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/5/20851784/vw-beetle-electric-conversion-frankfurt-motor-show VW beetle electric conversion]</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n\n[[File:KDF-wagen tinplate toy.JPG|thumb|1940 KDF-wagen (Volkswagen Beetle) tin-plate toy, by the Nuremberg toymaker Georg Fischer, displayed in the '' {{lang|de|[[Hamburg Museum of Work|Museum der Arbeit]]}}'', Hamburg, Germany]]\n\n* [[Black Current]]\n* [[Cal looker]]\n* [[Cal-Style VW]]\n* [[Herbie]], a famous fictional Volkswagen Beetle.\n* [[List of names for the Volkswagen Type 1]]\n* [[Meyers Manx]]\n* [[Punch buggy]]\n* [[Steyr 50]]\n* [[Trabant]]\n* [[Volksrod]]\n* [[Volkswagen advertising]]\n* [[Time Inc.
