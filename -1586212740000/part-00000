A figure in the [[punk rock|punk]] and [[grunge]] scenes of the 1990s, Love's career has spanned four decades. She rose to prominence as the [[lead vocalist]] of the [[alternative rock]] band [[Hole (band)|Hole]], which she formed in 1989. Love has drawn public attention for her uninhibited live performances and confrontational lyrics, as well as her highly publicized personal life following her marriage to [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]] frontman [[Kurt Cobain]]. In 2020, ''[[NME]]'' named her \"one of the most influential singers in alternative culture of the last 30 years.\"<ref name=icon/>\n\nBorn to [[counterculture|countercultural]] parents in [[San Francisco]], Love had an itinerant childhood, but was primarily raised in [[Portland, Oregon]], where she played in a series of short-lived bands and was active in the local punk scene. After briefly being in a juvenile hall, she spent a year living in [[Dublin]] and [[Liverpool]] before returning to the United States and was cast in the [[Alex Cox]] films ''[[Sid and Nancy]]'' (1986) and ''[[Straight to Hell (film)|Straight to Hell]]'' (1987). She formed Hole in Los Angeles, receiving attention from underground rock press for the group's [[Pretty on the Inside|1991 debut album]], produced by [[Kim Gordon]]. Hole's second release, ''[[Live Through This]]'' (1994), was met with critical accolades and [[RIAA certification|multi-platinum]] sales. In 1995, Love returned to acting, earning a [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actress in a Motion Picture \u2013 Drama|Golden Globe Award]] nomination for her performance as [[Althea Flynt|Althea Leasure]] in [[Milo\u0161 Forman]]'s ''[[The People vs. Larry Flynt]]'' (1996), which established her as a mainstream actress. The following year, Hole's third album, ''[[Celebrity Skin]]'' (1998), was nominated for three [[Grammy Award]]s.\n\nLove continued to work as an actress into the early 2000s, appearing in big-budget pictures such as ''[[Man on the Moon (film)|Man on the Moon]]'' (1999) and ''[[Trapped (2002 film)|Trapped]]'' (2002), before releasing her first solo album, ''[[America's Sweetheart (album)|America's Sweetheart]]'', in 2004. The next years were marked by publicity surrounding Love's legal troubles and [[drug addiction]], which resulted in a mandatory lockdown [[drug rehabilitation|rehabilitation]] sentence in 2005 while she was writing a second solo album. That project became ''[[Nobody's Daughter]]'', released in 2010 as a Hole album but without the former Hole lineup. Between 2014 and 2015, Love released two solo [[single (music)|singles]] and returned to acting in the network series ''[[Sons of Anarchy]]'' and ''[[Empire (2015 TV series)|Empire]]''.\n\nLove has also been active as a writer; she co-created and co-wrote three volumes of a [[manga]], ''[[Princess Ai]]'', between 2004 and 2006, and wrote a memoir, ''[[Dirty Blonde: The Diaries of Courtney Love]]'' (2006).\n\n==Biography==\n===1964\u20131981: Childhood and education===\nCourtney Michelle Harrison{{efn|Some publications have noted that Love was born Love Michelle Harrison, ostensibly based on claims Love made early in her career that she had been born with the first name Love.

(''[[n\u00e9e]]'' '''Harrison'''; born July 9, 1964) is an American singer, songwriter and actress. A figure in the [[punk rock|punk]] and [[grunge]] scenes of the 1990s, Love's career has spanned four decades. She rose to prominence as the [[lead vocalist]] of the [[alternative rock]] band [[Hole (band)|Hole]], which she formed in 1989. Love has drawn public attention for her uninhibited live performances and confrontational lyrics, as well as her highly publicized personal life following her marriage to [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]] frontman [[Kurt Cobain]]. In 2020, ''[[NME]]'' named her \"one of the most influential singers in alternative culture of the last 30 years.\"<ref name=icon/>\n\nBorn to [[counterculture|countercultural]] parents in [[San Francisco]], Love had an itinerant childhood, but was primarily raised in [[Portland, Oregon]], where she played in a series of short-lived bands and was active in the local punk scene. After briefly being in a juvenile hall, she spent a year living in [[Dublin]] and [[Liverpool]] before returning to the United States and was cast in the [[Alex Cox]] films ''[[Sid and Nancy]]'' (1986) and ''[[Straight to Hell (film)|Straight to Hell]]'' (1987). She formed Hole in Los Angeles, receiving attention from underground rock press for the group's [[Pretty on the Inside|1991 debut album]], produced by [[Kim Gordon]]. Hole's second release, ''[[Live Through This]]'' (1994), was met with critical accolades and [[RIAA certification|multi-platinum]] sales. In 1995, Love returned to acting, earning a [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actress in a Motion Picture \u2013 Drama|Golden Globe Award]] nomination for her performance as [[Althea Flynt|Althea Leasure]] in [[Milo\u0161 Forman]]'s ''[[The People vs. Larry Flynt]]'' (1996), which established her as a mainstream actress. The following year, Hole's third album, ''[[Celebrity Skin]]'' (1998), was nominated for three [[Grammy Award]]s.\n\nLove continued to work as an actress into the early 2000s, appearing in big-budget pictures such as ''[[Man on the Moon (film)|Man on the Moon]]'' (1999) and ''[[Trapped (2002 film)|Trapped]]'' (2002), before releasing her first solo album, ''[[America's Sweetheart (album)|America's Sweetheart]]'', in 2004. The next years were marked by publicity surrounding Love's legal troubles and [[drug addiction]], which resulted in a mandatory lockdown [[drug rehabilitation|rehabilitation]] sentence in 2005 while she was writing a second solo album. That project became ''[[Nobody's Daughter]]'', released in 2010 as a Hole album but without the former Hole lineup. Between 2014 and 2015, Love released two solo [[single (music)|singles]] and returned to acting in the network series ''[[Sons of Anarchy]]'' and ''[[Empire (2015 TV series)|Empire]]''.\n\nLove has also been active as a writer; she co-created and co-wrote three volumes of a [[manga]], ''[[Princess Ai]]'', between 2004 and 2006, and wrote a memoir, ''[[Dirty Blonde: The Diaries of Courtney Love]]'' (2006).\n\n==Biography==\n===1964\u20131981: Childhood and education===\nCourtney Michelle Harrison{{efn|Some publications have noted that Love was born Love Michelle Harrison, ostensibly based on claims Love made early in her career that she had been born with the first name Love.

Names are reported under the date of death, in alphabetical order by surname or pseudonym.\n\nA typical entry reports information in the following sequence:\n\n* Name, age, country of citizenship at birth, subsequent [[nationality]] (if applicable), what subject was noted for, cause of death (if known), and reference.\n\n<!--\n* * * * * * * Please adhere to the guidelines below when adding a name to this article. * * * * * * *\n\nA typical entry reports information in the following sequence: Name, age, country of citizenship at birth or nationality if the subject is not eligible (for example, in the case of animals), subsequent nationality (if applicable), what subject was noted for, cause of death (if known), and reference. Do not place a period at the end of the entry. Names are reported under the date of death. Names under each date are reported in alphabetical order by surname or pseudonym.\n\n(1) Please add only those meeting Wikipedia notability guidelines. Include a reference to a reliable source.[a] [b] If a Wikipedia article for the dead does not yet exist, reconsider whether the subject is actually notable. If so, consider writing an article yourself. Those without a Wikipedia article are removed after one month.\n\n(2) Please understand that the intent of this article is to report notable deaths. Tragic deaths, while unfortunate, do not necessarily render the dead \"notable\". If you report the death of a notable subject that does not already have a Wikipedia article, consider starting one. Include third-party sources other than the obituary.\n\n(3) Please add entries in alphabetical order by family name. Please avoid over-linking. As such, please do not add links to nationalities, common occupations, or common causes of death. Rather, include only \"links that aid navigation and understanding\". Thank you.\n\n(4) References should be in <ref>[url & title]</ref> format, as full citations make the page too slow to load, and too big to edit.\n\n--Notes--\n[a] See [[WP:RS]] for definition of reliable source, and [[WP:BLPSOURCE]] for living and recently deceased persons.\n[b] For information on using information from Ancestry.com, Find-a-grave, or IMDb, please see [[WP:ELPEREN]].\n* * * * * * * Please adhere to the guidelines above when adding a name to this article. * * * * * * *\n\n--->\n{{TOC right}}\n\n==April==\n===7===\n\n===6===\n*[[Radomir Anti\u0107]], 71, Serbian football player ([[FK Partizan|Partizan]]) and manager ([[Atl\u00e9tico Madrid]], [[Serbia national football team|national team]]), pancreatitis.<ref>[https://onefootball.com/en/news/legendary-laliga-boss-radomir-antic-passes-away-29642192 Legendary LaLiga boss Radomir Anti\u0107 passes away]</ref>\n*[[M.

{"title_page": "Strengthening mechanisms of materials", "text_new": "{{cleanup|date=October 2010}}\n\nMethods have been devised to modify the [[yield strength]], [[ductility]], and [[toughness]] of both [[crystalline]] and [[amorphous]] materials. These strengthening mechanisms give engineers the ability to tailor the mechanical properties of materials to suit a variety of different applications. For example, the favorable properties of steel result from [[Interstitial defect|interstitial]] incorporation of [[carbon]] into the [[iron]] lattice. [[Brass]], a binary [[alloy]] of [[copper]] and [[zinc]], has superior mechanical properties compared to its constituent metals due to solution strengthening.  Work hardening (such as beating a red-hot piece of metal on anvil) has also been used for centuries by blacksmiths to introduce [[dislocations]] into materials, increasing their [[yield strength]]s.\n\n==Basic description==\n[[Plastic deformation in solids|Plastic deformation]] occurs when large numbers of [[dislocation]]s move and multiply so as to result in macroscopic deformation.  In other words, it is the movement of dislocations in the material which allows for deformation. If we want to enhance a material's mechanical properties (i.e. increase the yield and [[tensile strength]]), we simply need to introduce a mechanism which prohibits the mobility of these dislocations. Whatever the mechanism may be, (work hardening, grain size reduction, etc.) they all hinder dislocation motion and render the material stronger than previously.<ref>Davidge, R.W., Mechanical Behavior of Ceramics, Cambridge Solid State Science Series, (1979)</ref><ref>Lawn, B.R., Fracture of Brittle Solids, Cambridge Solid State Science Series, 2nd Edn. (1993)</ref><ref>Green, D., An Introduction to the Mechanical Properties of Ceramics, Cambridge Solid State Science Series, Eds. Clarke, D.R., Suresh, S., Ward, I.M. (1998)</ref><ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Callister, William Jr, Materials Science and Engineering, An Introduction. John Wiley & Sons, NY, NY (1985)</ref> \n\nThe stress required to cause dislocation motion is orders of magnitude lower than the theoretical stress required to shift an entire plane of atoms, so this mode of stress relief is energetically favorable. Hence, the hardness and strength (both yield and tensile) critically depend on the ease with which dislocations move. [[Pinning points]], or locations in the crystal that oppose the motion of dislocations,<ref>Kuhlmann-Wilsdorf, D., \"Theory of Plastic Deformation,\" Materials Science and Engineering A, vol 113, pp 1-42, July 1989</ref> can be introduced into the lattice to reduce dislocation mobility, thereby increasing mechanical strength. Dislocations may be pinned due to [[stress field]] interactions with other dislocations and solute particles, creating physical barriers from second phase precipitates forming along grain boundaries. There are five main strengthening mechanisms for metals, each is a method to prevent dislocation motion and propagation, or make it energetically unfavorable for the dislocation to move. For a material that has been strengthened, by some processing method, the amount of force required to start irreversible [[plastic deformation in solids|(plastic) deformation]] is greater than it was for the original material.  \n\nIn [[amorphous]] materials such as polymers, amorphous ceramics (glass), and amorphous metals, the lack of long range order leads to yielding via mechanisms such as brittle fracture, [[crazing]], and [[shear band]] formation. In these systems, strengthening mechanisms do not involve dislocations, but rather consist of modifications to the chemical structure and processing of the constituent material.\n\nThe strength of materials cannot infinitely increase. Each of the mechanisms explained below involves some trade-off by which other material properties are compromised in the process of strengthening.\n\n==Strengthening mechanisms in metals==\n\n=== Work hardening  ===\n{{main|Work hardening}}\n\nThe primary species responsible for [[work hardening]] are dislocations. Dislocations interact with each other by generating stress fields in the material. The interaction between the stress fields of dislocations can impede dislocation motion by repulsive or attractive interactions. Additionally, if two dislocations cross, dislocation line entanglement occurs, causing the formation of a jog which opposes dislocation motion. These entanglements and jogs act as pinning points, which oppose dislocation motion. As both of these processes are more likely to occur when more dislocations are present, there is a correlation between dislocation density and yield strength,\n\n<math> \\Delta\\sigma_{y} = {Gb\\sqrt{\\rho_\\perp}} </math>\n\nwhere <math> G </math> is the [[shear modulus]], <math> b </math> is the [[Burgers vector]], and <math> \\rho_\\perp </math> is the dislocation density.\n\nIncreasing the dislocation density increases the yield strength which results in a higher shear stress required to move the dislocations. This process is easily observed while working a material (by a process of cold working in metals). Theoretically, the strength of a material with no dislocations will be extremely high (\u03c4=G/2) because plastic deformation would require the breaking of many bonds simultaneously. However, at moderate dislocation density values of around 10<sup>7</sup>-10<sup>9</sup> dislocations/m<sup>2</sup>, the material will exhibit a significantly lower mechanical strength. Analogously, it is easier to move a rubber rug across a surface by propagating a small ripple through it than by dragging the whole rug. At dislocation densities of 10<sup>14</sup> dislocations/m<sup>2</sup> or higher, the strength of the material becomes high once again. Also, the dislocation density cannot be infinitely high, because then the material would lose its crystalline structure.<sup>Citation needed</sup>\n\n[[Image:Interstitial solute.svg|thumb|250px| This is a schematic illustrating how the lattice is strained by the addition of interstitial solute. Notice the strain in the lattice that the solute atoms cause. The interstitial solute could be carbon in iron for example. The carbon atoms in the interstitial sites of the lattice creates a stress field that impedes dislocation movement.]]\n\n[[Image:Substitutional solute.svg|thumb|250px| This is a schematic illustrating how the lattice is strained by the addition of substitutional  solute. Notice the strain in the lattice that the solute atom causes.]]\n\n=== Solid solution strengthening and alloying ===\n{{main|Solid solution strengthening}}\nFor this strengthening mechanism, solute atoms of one element are added to another, resulting in either substitutional or interstitial point defects in the [[crystal]] (see Figure 1). The solute atoms cause lattice distortions that impede dislocation motion, increasing the [[yield stress]] of the material. Solute atoms have stress fields around them which can interact with those of dislocations. The presence of solute atoms impart compressive or tensile stresses to the lattice, depending on solute '''size''', which interfere with nearby dislocations, causing the solute atoms to act as potential barriers.\n\nThe shear stress required to move dislocations in a material is:\n\n<math> \\Delta\\tau = Gb\\sqrt{c} \\epsilon^{3/2} </math>\n\nwhere <math> c </math> is the solute concentration and <math> \\epsilon </math> is the strain on the material caused by the solute.\n\nIncreasing the concentration of the solute atoms will increase the yield strength of a material, but there is a limit to the amount of solute that can be added, and one should look at the phase diagram for the material and the alloy to make sure that a second phase is not created.\n\nIn general, the solid solution strengthening depends on the concentration of the solute atoms, shear modulus of the solute atoms, size of solute atoms, valency of solute atoms (for ionic materials), and the symmetry of the solute stress field. The magnitude of strengthening is higher for non-symmetric stress fields because these solutes can interact with both edge and screw dislocations, whereas symmetric stress fields, which cause only volume change and not shape change, can only interact with edge dislocations.\n[[Image:Particle strengthening.svg|thumb|250px|'''Figure 2:''' A schematic illustrating how the dislocations can interact with a particle. It can either cut through the particle or bow around the particle and create a dislocation loop as it moves over the particle.]]\n\n=== Precipitation hardening ===\n{{main|Precipitation strengthening}}\nIn most binary systems, alloying above a concentration given by the phase diagram will cause the formation of a second phase. A second phase can also be created by mechanical or thermal treatments. The particles that compose the second phase precipitates act as pinning points in a similar manner to solutes, though the particles are not necessarily single atoms.\n\nThe dislocations in a material can interact with the precipitate atoms in one of two ways (see Figure 2). If the precipitate atoms are small, the dislocations would cut through them. As a result, new surfaces (b in Figure 2) of the particle would get exposed to the matrix and the particle-matrix interfacial energy would increase. For larger precipitate particles, looping or bowing of the dislocations would occur and result in dislocations getting longer. Hence, at a critical radius of about 5&nbsp;nm, dislocations will preferably cut across the obstacle, while for a radius of 30&nbsp;nm, the dislocations will readily bow or loop to overcome the obstacle. \n\nThe mathematical descriptions are as follows: \n\nFor particle bowing-  \n<math> \\Delta \\tau = {Gb\\over L-2r} </math>\n\nFor particle cutting- \n<math> \\Delta \\tau = {\\gamma \\pi r \\over b L} </math>\n\n[[Image:Dislocation pileup.svg|thumb|200px|'''Figure 3:'''  A schematic roughly illustrating the concept of dislocation pile up and how it effects the strength of the material. A material with larger grain size is able to have more dislocation to pile up leading to a bigger driving force for dislocations to move from one grain to another. Thus, less force need be applied to move a dislocation from a larger, than from a smaller grain, leading materials with smaller grains to exhibit higher yield stress.]]\n\n=== Grain boundary strengthening ===\n{{main|Grain boundary strengthening}}\nIn a polycrystalline metal, grain size has a tremendous influence on the mechanical properties. Because grains usually have varying crystallographic orientations, grain boundaries arise. While undergoing deformation, slip motion will take place. Grain boundaries act as an impediment to dislocation motion for the following two reasons: \n\n1. Dislocation must change its direction of motion due to the differing orientation of grains.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/><br>\n2. Discontinuity of slip planes from grain one to grain two.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nThe stress required to move a dislocation from one grain to another in order to plastically deform a material depends on the grain size. The average number of dislocations per grain decreases with average grain size (see Figure 3). A lower number of dislocations per grain results in a lower dislocation 'pressure' building up at grain boundaries. This makes it more difficult for dislocations to move into adjacent grains. This relationship is the [[Grain boundary strengthening#Hall\u2013Petch relationship|Hall-Petch relationship]] and can be mathematically described as follows:\n\n<math> \\sigma_{y} = \\sigma_{y,0} + {k \\over {d^x}} </math>,\n\nwhere <math>k</math> is a constant, <math>d</math> is the average grain diameter and <math>\\sigma_{y,0}</math> is the original yield stress.\n\nThe fact that the yield strength increases with decreasing grain size is accompanied by the caveat that the grain size cannot be decreased infinitely. As the grain size decreases, more free volume is generated resulting in lattice mismatch. Below approximately 10&nbsp;nm, the grain boundaries will tend to slide instead; a phenomenon known as [[grain-boundary sliding]]. If the grain size gets too small, it becomes more difficult to fit the dislocations in the grain and the stress required to move them is less.  It was not possible to produce materials with grain sizes below 10&nbsp;nm until recently, so the discovery that strength decreases below a critical grain size is still finding new applications.\n\n=== Transformation hardening ===\nThis method of hardening is used for steels.\n\nHigh-strength steels generally fall into three basic categories, classified by the strengthening mechanism employed.\n1- [[Solid solution strengthening|solid-solution-strengthened steels (rephos steels)]]\n2- [[Solid solution strengthening|grain-refined steels]] or [[High-strength low-alloy steel|high strength low alloy steels (HSLA)]]\n3- transformation-hardened steels\n\nTransformation-hardened steels are the third type of high-strength steels.These steels use predominantly higher levels of C and Mn along with heat treatment to increase strength.  The finished product will have a duplex micro-structure of ferrite with varying levels of degenerate \nmartensite.  This allows for varying levels of strength.  There are three basic types of transformation-hardened steels.  These are dual-phase (DP), transformation-induced plasticity (TRIP), and martensitic steels. \n\nThe annealing process for dual -phase steels consists of first holding the steel in the alpha + gamma temperature region for a set period of time.  During that time C and Mn diffuse into the austenite leaving a ferrite of greater purity.  The steel is then quenched so that the austenite is transformed \ninto martensite, and the ferrite remains on cooling. The steel is then subjected to a temper cycle to allow some level of marten-site decomposition.  By controlling the amount of martensite in the steel, as well as the degree of temper, the strength level can be controlled.  Depending on \nprocessing and chemistry, the strength level can range from 350 to 960 MPa. \n \nTRIP steels also use C and Mn, along with heat treatment, in order to retain small amounts of austenite and bainite in a ferrite matrix.  Thermal processing for TRIP steels again involves annealing the steel in the a + g region for a period of time sufficient to allow C and Mn to diffuse \ninto austenite.  The steel is then quenched to a point above the martensite start temperature and held there.  This allows the formation of bainite, an austenite decomposition product.  While at this temperature, more C is allowed to enrich the retained austenite.  This, in turn, lowers the \nmartensite start temperature to below room temperature.  Upon final quenching a metastable austenite is retained in the predominantly ferrite matrix along with small amounts of bainite (and other forms of decomposed austenite).  This combination of micro-structures has the added \nbenefits of higher strengths and resistance to necking during forming.  This offers great improvements in formability over other high-strength steels. Essentially, as the TRIP steel is being formed, it becomes much stronger.  Tensile strengths of TRIP steels are in the range of 600-960 MPa.\n  \nMartensitic steels are also high in C and Mn.  These are fully quenched to martensite during processing.  The martensite structure is then tempered back to the appropriate strength level, adding toughness to the steel.  Tensile strengths for these steels range as high as 1500 MPa.\n\n==Strengthening mechanisms in amorphous materials==\n\n===Polymer===\n\n[[Polymers]] [[fracture]] via breaking of inter- and intra molecular bonds; hence, the chemical structure of these materials plays a huge role in increasing strength. For [[polymers]] consisting of chains which easily slide past each other, chemical and physical cross linking can be used to increase rigidity and yield strength. In thermoset polymers ([[thermosetting plastic]]), disulfide bridges and other [[covalent]] cross links give rise to a hard structure which can withstand very high temperatures. These cross-links are particularly helpful in improving tensile strength of materials which contain lots of free volume prone to crazing, typically glassy brittle polymers.<ref name=Meyers>Meyers, Chawla. ''Mechanical Behavior of Materials.'' Cambridge University Press. pg 420-425. 1999</ref> In [[thermoplastic elastomer]], phase separation of dissimilar [[monomer]] components leads to association of hard domains within a sea of soft phase, yielding a physical structure with increased strength and rigidity. If yielding occurs by chains sliding past each other (shear bands), the strength can also be increased by introducing kinks into the polymer chains via unsaturated carbon-carbon bonds.<ref name=Meyers/>\n\nAdding [[Filler (materials)|filler materials]] such as fibers, platelets, and particles is a commonly employed technique for strengthening polymer materials. Fillers such as clay, silica, and carbon network materials have been extensively researched and used in polymer composites in part due to their effect on mechanical properties. Stiffness-confinement effects near rigid interfaces, such as those between a polymer matrix and stiffer filler materials, enhance the stiffness of composites by restricting polymer chain motion.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.110.108303|pmid=23521308|title=Effect of Nanoconfinement on Polymer Dynamics: Surface Layers and Interphases|journal=Physical Review Letters|volume=110|issue=10|pages=108303|year=2013|last1=Krutyeva|first1=M.|last2=Wischnewski|first2=A.|last3=Monkenbusch|first3=M.|last4=Willner|first4=L.|last5=Maiz|first5=J.|last6=Mijangos|first6=C.|last7=Arbe|first7=A.|last8=Colmenero|first8=J.|last9=Radulescu|first9=A.|last10=Holderer|first10=O.|last11=Ohl|first11=M.|last12=Richter|first12=D.|hdl=10261/102483}}</ref> This is especially present where fillers are chemically treated to strongly interact with polymer chains, increasing the anchoring of polymer chains to the filler interfaces and thus further restricting the motion of chains away from the interface.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1039/C5PY01631B|title=Toughening of photo-curable polymer networks: A review|journal=Polymer Chemistry|volume=7|issue=2|pages=257\u2013286|year=2016|last1=Ligon-Auer|first1=Samuel Clark|last2=Schwentenwein|first2=Martin|last3=Gorsche|first3=Christian|last4=Stampfl|first4=J\u00fcrgen|last5=Liska|first5=Robert}}</ref> Stiffness-confinement effects have been characterized in model nanocomposites, and shows that composites with length scales on the order of nanometers increase the effect of the fillers on polymer stiffness dramatically.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1021/acs.macromol.7b00917|title=Stiffness Gradients in Glassy Polymer Model Nanocomposites: Comparisons of Quantitative Characterization by Fluorescence Spectroscopy and Atomic Force Microscopy|journal=Macromolecules|volume=50|issue=14|pages=5447\u20135458|year=2017|last1=Zhang|first1=Min|last2=Askar|first2=Shadid|last3=Torkelson|first3=John M.|last4=Brinson|first4=L. Catherine}}</ref>\n\nIncreasing the bulkiness of the [[monomer]] unit via incorporation of aryl rings is another strengthening mechanism. The [[anisotropy]] of the molecular structure means that these mechanisms are heavily dependent on the direction of applied stress. While aryl rings drastically increase rigidity along the direction of the chain, these materials may still be brittle in perpendicular directions. Macroscopic structure can be adjusted to compensate for this [[anisotropy]]. For example, the high strength of [[Kevlar]] arises from a stacked multilayer macrostructure where aromatic polymer layers are rotated with respect to their neighbors. When loaded oblique to the chain direction, ductile polymers with flexible linkages, such as oriented [[polyethylene]], are highly prone to shear band formation, so macroscopic structures which place the load parallel to the draw direction would increase strength.<ref name=Meyers/> \n\nMixing polymers is another method of increasing strength, particularly with materials that show crazing preceding brittle fracture such as atactic [[polystyrene]] (APS). For example, by forming a 50/50 mixture of APS with polyphenylene oxide (PPO), this embrittling tendency can be almost completely suppressed, substantially increasing the fracture strength.<ref name=Meyers/>\n\n[[Interpenetrating polymer network|Interpenetrating polymer networks]] (IPNs), consisting of interlacing crosslinked polymer networks that are not covalently bonded to one another, can lead to enhanced strength in polymer materials. The use of an IPN approach imposes compatibility (and thus macroscale homogeneity) on otherwise immiscible blends, allowing for a blending of mechanical properties. For example, silicone-polyurethane IPNs show increased tear and flexural strength over base silicone networks, while preserving the high elastic recovery of the silicone network at high strains.<ref>{{cite book |doi=10.1021/ba-1990-0224.ch010|chapter=Polysiloxane\u2014Thermoplastic Interpenetrating Polymer Networks|title=Silicon-Based Polymer Science|volume=224|pages=181\u2013199|series=Advances in Chemistry|year=1989|last1=Arkles|first1=Barry|last2=Crosby|first2=Jane|isbn=0-8412-1546-4}}</ref> Increased stiffness can also be achieved by pre-straining polymer networks and then sequentially forming a secondary network within the strained material.

By introducing compression stress into the structure, the tensile strength of the material can be increased. This is typically done via two mechanisms: thermal treatment (tempering) or chemical bath (via ion exchange). \n\nIn tempered glasses, air jets are used to rapidly cool the top and bottom surfaces of a softened (hot) slab of glass. Since the surface cools quicker, there is more free volume at the surface than in the bulk melt.  The core of the slab then pulls the surface inward, resulting in an internal compressive stress at the surface. This substantially increases the tensile strength of the material as tensile stresses exerted on the glass must now resolve the compressive stresses before yielding.\n\n<math> \\sigma_{y=modified}  = \\sigma_{y,0} + \\sigma_{compressive} </math>\n\nAlternately, in chemical treatment, a glass slab treated containing network formers and modifiers is submerged into a molten salt bath containing ions larger than those present in the modifier. Due to a concentration gradient of the ions, mass transport must take place. As the larger cation diffuses from the molten salt into the surface, it replaces the smaller ion from the modifier. The larger ion squeezing into surface introduces compressive stress in the glass's surface. A common example is treatment of sodium oxide modified silicate glass in molten [[potassium chloride]]. \nExamples of [[chemically strengthened glass]] are [[Gorilla Glass]] developed and manufactured by [[Corning Inc.|Corning]], [[AGC Inc.]]'s [[Dragontrail]] and [[Schott AG]]'s Xensation.\n\n== Composite strengthening  ==\n\nMany of the basic strengthening mechanisms can be classified based on their dimensionality. At 0-D there is precipitate and solid solution strengthening with particulates strengthening structure, at 1-D there is work/forest hardening with line dislocations as the hardening mechanism, and at 2-D there is grain boundary strengthening with surface energy of granular interfaces providing strength improvement. The two primary types of composite strengthening, fiber reinforcement and laminar reinforcement, fall in the 1-D and 2-D classes, respectively. The anisotropy of fiber and laminar composite strength reflects these dimensionalities. The primary idea behind composite strengthening is to combine materials with opposite strengths and weaknesses to create a material which transfers load onto the stiffer material but benefits from the ductility and toughness of the softer material. <ref name=\"courtney\">{{cite book |last1=Courtney |first1=Thomas H |title=Mechanical Behavior of Materials |date=1990 |publisher=Waveland Press Inc. |location=Long Grove, IL |edition=2nd}}</ref>\n\n=== Fiber reinforcement ===\n{{main|Fiber-reinforced composite}}\nFiber-reinforced composites (FRCs) consist of a matrix of one material containing parallel embedded fibers. There are two variants of fiber-reinforced composites, one with stiff fibers and a ductile matrix and one with ductile fibers and a stiff matrix. The former variant is exemplified by fiberglass which contains very strong but delicate glass fibers embedded in a softer plastic matrix resilient to fracture. The latter variant is found in almost all buildings as reinforced concrete with ductile, high tensile-strength steel rods embedded in brittle, high compressive-strength concrete. In both cases, the matrix and fibers have complimentary mechanical properties and the resulting composite material is therefore more practical for applications in the real world.\n\nFor a composite containing aligned, stiff fibers which span the length of the material and a soft, ductile matrix, the following descriptions provide a rough model.\n\n==== Four stages of deformation ====\nThe condition of a fiber-reinforced composite under applied tensile stress along the direction of the fibers can be decomposed into four stages from small strain to large strain. Since the stress is parallel to the fibers, the deformation is described by the isostrain condition, i.e., the fiber and matrix experience the same strain. At each stage, the composite stress (<math> \\sigma_{c} </math>) is given in terms of the volume fractions of the fiber and matrix (<math> V_{f}, V_{m}  </math>), the Young's moduli of the fiber and matrix (<math> E_{f}, E_{m}  </math>), the strain of the composite (<math> \\epsilon_{c}  </math>), and the stress of the fiber and matrix as read from a stress-strain curve (<math> \\sigma_{f}(\\epsilon_{c}), \\sigma_{m}(\\epsilon_{c})  </math>).\n\n# Both fiber and composite remain in the elastic strain regime. In this stage, we also note that the composite Young's modulus is a simple weighted sum of the two component moduli.\n#:<math> \\sigma_{c} = V_{f}\\epsilon_{c}E_{f} +  V_{m}\\epsilon_{c}E_{m} </math> <ref name=\"courtney\"/>\n#:<math> E_{c} = V_{f}E_{f} +  V_{m}E_{m} </math> <ref name=\"courtney\"/>\n# The fiber remains in the elastic regime but the matrix yields and plastically deforms.\n#:<math> \\sigma_{c} = V_{f}\\epsilon_{c}E_{f} +  V_{m}\\sigma_{m}(\\epsilon_{c}) </math> <ref name=\"courtney\"/>\n# Both fiber and composite yield and plastically deform.

Given the assumptions outlined above, the first tensile strength would correspond to failure of the fibers, with some support from the matrix plastic deformation strength, and the second with failure of the matrix.\n\n:<math>TS_1 = V_fTS_f + V_m\\sigma_m(\\epsilon_c) </math> <ref name=\"courtney\"/>\n\n:<math>TS_2 = V_mTS_m </math> <ref name=\"courtney\"/>\n\n==== Anisotropy (Orientation effects) ====\nAs a result of the aforementioned dimensionality (1-D) of fiber reinforcement, significant anisotropy is observed in its mechanical properties. The following equations model the tensile strength of a FRC as a function of the misalignment angle (<math>\\theta</math>) between the fibers and the applied force, the stresses in the parallel and perpendicular, or <math>\\theta=0</math> and <math>90</math>{{sup|o}}, cases (<math>\\ \\sigma_{||}, \\sigma_{\\perp}</math>), and the shear strength of the matrix (<math> \\tau_{my} </math>).\n\n;:Small Misalignment Angle (longitudinal fracture)\n: The angle is small enough to maintain load transfer onto the fibers and prevent delamination of fibers ''and'' the misaligned stress samples a slightly larger cross-sectional area of the fiber so the strength of the fiber is not just maintained but actually increases compared to the parallel case.\n: <math>TS(\\theta) = \\frac{\\sigma_{||}}{\\cos^2(\\theta)}</math> <ref name=\"courtney\"/>\n\n;:Significant Misalignment Angle (shear failure)\n: The angle is large enough that the load is not effectively transferred to the fibers and the matrix experiences enough strain to fracture.\n: <math>TS(\\theta) = \\frac{\\tau_{my}}{\\sin(\\theta)\\cos(\\theta)} </math> <ref name=\"courtney\"/>\n\n;:Near Perpendicular Misaligment Angle (transverse fracture)\n: The angle is close to 90{{sup|o}} so most of the load remains in the matrix and thus tensile transverse matrix fracture is the dominant failure condition.

A primary application of strengthened materials is for construction. In order to have stronger buildings and bridges, one must have a strong frame that can support high tensile or compressive load and resist plastic deformation. The steel frame used to make the building should be as strong as possible so that it does not bend under the entire weight of the building. Polymeric roofing materials would also need to be strong so that the roof does not cave in when there is build-up of snow on the rooftop.\n\nResearch is also currently being done to increase the strength of metallic materials through the addition of polymer materials such as bonded carbon fiber reinforced polymer to (CFRP)[https://archive.today/20130202115814/http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&_udi=B6V2G-4GX6HXM-8&_user=501045&_coverDate=03/31/2006&_rdoc=1&_fmt=&_orig=search&_sort=d&view=c&_acct=C000022659&_version=1&_urlVersion=0&_userid=501045&md5=f938f165c8666c9fa0174d293e45297b%23bib4].\n\n===Molecular dynamics simulations===\nThe use of computation simulations to model work hardening in materials allows for the direct observation of critical elements that rule the process of strengthening materials.  The basic reasoning derives from the fact that, when examining plasticity and the movement of dislocations in materials, a focus on the atomistic level is many times not accounted for and the focus rests on the contiuum description of materials.  Since the practice of tracking these atomistic effects in experiments and theorizing about them in textbooks cannot provide a full understanding of these interactions, many turn to molecular dynamics simulations to develop this understanding.<ref name=Buehler>Buehler, Markus J. ''the dynamical complexity of work - hardening:  a large-scale molecular dynamics simulation.'' Acta Mech Sinica. pg 103-111. 2005</ref>\n\nThe simulations work by utilizing the known atomic interactions between any two atoms and the relationship F = ma, so that the dislocations moving through the material are ruled by simple mechanical actions and reactions of the atoms.  The [[interatomic potential]] usually utilized to estimate these interactions is the Lennard \u2013 Jones 12:6 potential.  Lennard \u2013 Jones is widely accepted because its experimental shortcomings are well-known.<ref name=Buehler/><ref name=Abraham>Abraham, F.  \"Simulating materials failure by using up to one billion atoms and the world's fastest computer: Work-hardening.\"  Proc Natl Acad Sci.  pg 5783\u20135787. 2002</ref>  These interactions are simply scaled up to millions or billions of atoms in some cases to simulate materials more accurately.  \n\nMolecular dynamic simulations display the interactions based upon the governing equations provided above for the strengthening mechanisms.  They provide an effective way to see these mechanisms in action outside the painstaking realm of direct observation during experiments.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Grain boundary strengthening]]\n*[[Precipitation strengthening]]\n*[[Solid solution strengthening]]\n*[[Strength of materials]]\n*[[Tempering (metallurgy)]]\n*[[Work hardening]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|40em}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/311/5758/212 Grain boundary strengthening in alumina by rare earth impurities]\n*[https://doi.org/10.1007%2FBF00801481 Mechanism of grain boundary strengthening of steels]\n*[http://zambaldi.de/software/stabix/ An open source Matlab toolbox for analysis of slip transfer through grain boundaries]\n\n[[Category:Materials science]]\n[[Category:Strengthening mechanisms of materials|*]]\n", "text_old": "{{cleanup|date=October 2010}}\n\nMethods have been devised to modify the [[yield strength]], [[ductility]], and [[toughness]] of both [[crystalline]] and [[amorphous]] materials. These strengthening mechanisms give engineers the ability to tailor the mechanical properties of materials to suit a variety of different applications. For example, the favorable properties of steel result from [[Interstitial defect|interstitial]] incorporation of [[carbon]] into the [[iron]] lattice. [[Brass]], a binary [[alloy]] of [[copper]] and [[zinc]], has superior mechanical properties compared to its constituent metals due to solution strengthening.  Work hardening (such as beating a red-hot piece of metal on anvil) has also been used for centuries by blacksmiths to introduce [[dislocations]] into materials, increasing their [[yield strength]]s.\n\n==Basic description==\n[[Plastic deformation in solids|Plastic deformation]] occurs when large numbers of [[dislocation]]s move and multiply so as to result in macroscopic deformation.  In other words, it is the movement of dislocations in the material which allows for deformation. If we want to enhance a material's mechanical properties (i.e. increase the yield and [[tensile strength]]), we simply need to introduce a mechanism which prohibits the mobility of these dislocations. Whatever the mechanism may be, (work hardening, grain size reduction, etc.) they all hinder dislocation motion and render the material stronger than previously.<ref>Davidge, R.W., Mechanical Behavior of Ceramics, Cambridge Solid State Science Series, (1979)</ref><ref>Lawn, B.R., Fracture of Brittle Solids, Cambridge Solid State Science Series, 2nd Edn.

John Wiley & Sons, NY, NY (1985)</ref> \n\nThe stress required to cause dislocation motion is orders of magnitude lower than the theoretical stress required to shift an entire plane of atoms, so this mode of stress relief is energetically favorable. Hence, the hardness and strength (both yield and tensile) critically depend on the ease with which dislocations move. [[Pinning points]], or locations in the crystal that oppose the motion of dislocations,<ref>Kuhlmann-Wilsdorf, D., \"Theory of Plastic Deformation,\" Materials Science and Engineering A, vol 113, pp 1-42, July 1989</ref> can be introduced into the lattice to reduce dislocation mobility, thereby increasing mechanical strength. Dislocations may be pinned due to [[stress field]] interactions with other dislocations and solute particles, creating physical barriers from second phase precipitates forming along grain boundaries. There are five main strengthening mechanisms for metals, each is a method to prevent dislocation motion and propagation, or make it energetically unfavorable for the dislocation to move. For a material that has been strengthened, by some processing method, the amount of force required to start irreversible [[plastic deformation in solids|(plastic) deformation]] is greater than it was for the original material.  \n\nIn [[amorphous]] materials such as polymers, amorphous ceramics (glass), and amorphous metals, the lack of long range order leads to yielding via mechanisms such as brittle fracture, [[crazing]], and [[shear band]] formation. In these systems, strengthening mechanisms do not involve dislocations, but rather consist of modifications to the chemical structure and processing of the constituent material.\n\nThe strength of materials cannot infinitely increase. Each of the mechanisms explained below involves some trade-off by which other material properties are compromised in the process of strengthening.\n\n==Strengthening mechanisms in metals==\n\n=== Work hardening  ===\n{{main|Work hardening}}\n\nThe primary species responsible for [[work hardening]] are dislocations. Dislocations interact with each other by generating stress fields in the material. The interaction between the stress fields of dislocations can impede dislocation motion by repulsive or attractive interactions. Additionally, if two dislocations cross, dislocation line entanglement occurs, causing the formation of a jog which opposes dislocation motion. These entanglements and jogs act as pinning points, which oppose dislocation motion. As both of these processes are more likely to occur when more dislocations are present, there is a correlation between dislocation density and yield strength,\n\n<math> \\Delta\\sigma_{y} = {Gb\\sqrt{\\rho_\\perp}} </math>\n\nwhere <math> G </math> is the [[shear modulus]], <math> b </math> is the [[Burgers vector]], and <math> \\rho_\\perp </math> is the dislocation density.\n\nIncreasing the dislocation density increases the yield strength which results in a higher shear stress required to move the dislocations. This process is easily observed while working a material (by a process of cold working in metals). Theoretically, the strength of a material with no dislocations will be extremely high (\u03c4=G/2) because plastic deformation would require the breaking of many bonds simultaneously. However, at moderate dislocation density values of around 10<sup>7</sup>-10<sup>9</sup> dislocations/m<sup>2</sup>, the material will exhibit a significantly lower mechanical strength. Analogously, it is easier to move a rubber rug across a surface by propagating a small ripple through it than by dragging the whole rug. At dislocation densities of 10<sup>14</sup> dislocations/m<sup>2</sup> or higher, the strength of the material becomes high once again. Also, the dislocation density cannot be infinitely high, because then the material would lose its crystalline structure.<sup>Citation needed</sup>\n\n[[Image:Interstitial solute.svg|thumb|250px| This is a schematic illustrating how the lattice is strained by the addition of interstitial solute. Notice the strain in the lattice that the solute atoms cause. The interstitial solute could be carbon in iron for example. The carbon atoms in the interstitial sites of the lattice creates a stress field that impedes dislocation movement.]]\n\n[[Image:Substitutional solute.svg|thumb|250px| This is a schematic illustrating how the lattice is strained by the addition of substitutional  solute. Notice the strain in the lattice that the solute atom causes.]]\n\n=== Solid solution strengthening and alloying ===\n{{main|Solid solution strengthening}}\nFor this strengthening mechanism, solute atoms of one element are added to another, resulting in either substitutional or interstitial point defects in the [[crystal]] (see Figure 1). The solute atoms cause lattice distortions that impede dislocation motion, increasing the [[yield stress]] of the material. Solute atoms have stress fields around them which can interact with those of dislocations. The presence of solute atoms impart compressive or tensile stresses to the lattice, depending on solute '''size''', which interfere with nearby dislocations, causing the solute atoms to act as potential barriers.\n\nThe shear stress required to move dislocations in a material is:\n\n<math> \\Delta\\tau = Gb\\sqrt{c} \\epsilon^{3/2} </math>\n\nwhere <math> c </math> is the solute concentration and <math> \\epsilon </math> is the strain on the material caused by the solute.\n\nIncreasing the concentration of the solute atoms will increase the yield strength of a material, but there is a limit to the amount of solute that can be added, and one should look at the phase diagram for the material and the alloy to make sure that a second phase is not created.\n\nIn general, the solid solution strengthening depends on the concentration of the solute atoms, shear modulus of the solute atoms, size of solute atoms, valency of solute atoms (for ionic materials), and the symmetry of the solute stress field. The magnitude of strengthening is higher for non-symmetric stress fields because these solutes can interact with both edge and screw dislocations, whereas symmetric stress fields, which cause only volume change and not shape change, can only interact with edge dislocations.\n[[Image:Particle strengthening.svg|thumb|250px|'''Figure 2:''' A schematic illustrating how the dislocations can interact with a particle. It can either cut through the particle or bow around the particle and create a dislocation loop as it moves over the particle.]]\n\n=== Precipitation hardening ===\n{{main|Precipitation strengthening}}\nIn most binary systems, alloying above a concentration given by the phase diagram will cause the formation of a second phase. A second phase can also be created by mechanical or thermal treatments. The particles that compose the second phase precipitates act as pinning points in a similar manner to solutes, though the particles are not necessarily single atoms.\n\nThe dislocations in a material can interact with the precipitate atoms in one of two ways (see Figure 2). If the precipitate atoms are small, the dislocations would cut through them. As a result, new surfaces (b in Figure 2) of the particle would get exposed to the matrix and the particle-matrix interfacial energy would increase. For larger precipitate particles, looping or bowing of the dislocations would occur and result in dislocations getting longer. Hence, at a critical radius of about 5&nbsp;nm, dislocations will preferably cut across the obstacle, while for a radius of 30&nbsp;nm, the dislocations will readily bow or loop to overcome the obstacle. \n\nThe mathematical descriptions are as follows: \n\nFor particle bowing-  \n<math> \\Delta \\tau = {Gb\\over L-2r} </math>\n\nFor particle cutting- \n<math> \\Delta \\tau = {\\gamma \\pi r \\over b L} </math>\n\n[[Image:Dislocation pileup.svg|thumb|200px|'''Figure 3:'''  A schematic roughly illustrating the concept of dislocation pile up and how it effects the strength of the material. A material with larger grain size is able to have more dislocation to pile up leading to a bigger driving force for dislocations to move from one grain to another. Thus, less force need be applied to move a dislocation from a larger, than from a smaller grain, leading materials with smaller grains to exhibit higher yield stress.]]\n\n=== Grain boundary strengthening ===\n{{main|Grain boundary strengthening}}\nIn a polycrystalline metal, grain size has a tremendous influence on the mechanical properties. Because grains usually have varying crystallographic orientations, grain boundaries arise. While undergoing deformation, slip motion will take place. Grain boundaries act as an impediment to dislocation motion for the following two reasons: \n\n1. Dislocation must change its direction of motion due to the differing orientation of grains.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/><br>\n2. Discontinuity of slip planes from grain one to grain two.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nThe stress required to move a dislocation from one grain to another in order to plastically deform a material depends on the grain size. The average number of dislocations per grain decreases with average grain size (see Figure 3). A lower number of dislocations per grain results in a lower dislocation 'pressure' building up at grain boundaries. This makes it more difficult for dislocations to move into adjacent grains. This relationship is the [[Grain boundary strengthening#Hall\u2013Petch relationship|Hall-Petch relationship]] and can be mathematically described as follows:\n\n<math> \\sigma_{y} = \\sigma_{y,0} + {k \\over {d^x}} </math>,\n\nwhere <math>k</math> is a constant, <math>d</math> is the average grain diameter and <math>\\sigma_{y,0}</math> is the original yield stress.\n\nThe fact that the yield strength increases with decreasing grain size is accompanied by the caveat that the grain size cannot be decreased infinitely. As the grain size decreases, more free volume is generated resulting in lattice mismatch. Below approximately 10&nbsp;nm, the grain boundaries will tend to slide instead; a phenomenon known as [[grain-boundary sliding]]. If the grain size gets too small, it becomes more difficult to fit the dislocations in the grain and the stress required to move them is less.  It was not possible to produce materials with grain sizes below 10&nbsp;nm until recently, so the discovery that strength decreases below a critical grain size is still finding new applications.\n\n=== Transformation hardening ===\nThis method of hardening is used for steels.\n\nHigh-strength steels generally fall into three basic categories, classified by the strengthening mechanism employed.\n1- [[Solid solution strengthening|solid-solution-strengthened steels (rephos steels)]]\n2- [[Solid solution strengthening|grain-refined steels]] or [[High-strength low-alloy steel|high strength low alloy steels (HSLA)]]\n3- transformation-hardened steels\n\nTransformation-hardened steels are the third type of high-strength steels.These steels use predominantly higher levels of C and Mn along with heat treatment to increase strength.  The finished product will have a duplex micro-structure of ferrite with varying levels of degenerate \nmartensite.  This allows for varying levels of strength.  There are three basic types of transformation-hardened steels.  These are dual-phase (DP), transformation-induced plasticity (TRIP), and martensitic steels. \n\nThe annealing process for dual -phase steels consists of first holding the steel in the alpha + gamma temperature region for a set period of time.  During that time C and Mn diffuse into the austenite leaving a ferrite of greater purity.  The steel is then quenched so that the austenite is transformed \ninto martensite, and the ferrite remains on cooling. The steel is then subjected to a temper cycle to allow some level of marten-site decomposition.  By controlling the amount of martensite in the steel, as well as the degree of temper, the strength level can be controlled.  Depending on \nprocessing and chemistry, the strength level can range from 350 to 960 MPa. \n \nTRIP steels also use C and Mn, along with heat treatment, in order to retain small amounts of austenite and bainite in a ferrite matrix.  Thermal processing for TRIP steels again involves annealing the steel in the a + g region for a period of time sufficient to allow C and Mn to diffuse \ninto austenite.  The steel is then quenched to a point above the martensite start temperature and held there.  This allows the formation of bainite, an austenite decomposition product.  While at this temperature, more C is allowed to enrich the retained austenite.  This, in turn, lowers the \nmartensite start temperature to below room temperature.  Upon final quenching a metastable austenite is retained in the predominantly ferrite matrix along with small amounts of bainite (and other forms of decomposed austenite).  This combination of micro-structures has the added \nbenefits of higher strengths and resistance to necking during forming.  This offers great improvements in formability over other high-strength steels. Essentially, as the TRIP steel is being formed, it becomes much stronger.  Tensile strengths of TRIP steels are in the range of 600-960 MPa.\n  \nMartensitic steels are also high in C and Mn.  These are fully quenched to martensite during processing.  The martensite structure is then tempered back to the appropriate strength level, adding toughness to the steel.  Tensile strengths for these steels range as high as 1500 MPa.\n\n==Strengthening mechanisms in amorphous materials==\n\n===Polymer===\n\n[[Polymers]] [[fracture]] via breaking of inter- and intra molecular bonds; hence, the chemical structure of these materials plays a huge role in increasing strength. For [[polymers]] consisting of chains which easily slide past each other, chemical and physical cross linking can be used to increase rigidity and yield strength. In thermoset polymers ([[thermosetting plastic]]), disulfide bridges and other [[covalent]] cross links give rise to a hard structure which can withstand very high temperatures. These cross-links are particularly helpful in improving tensile strength of materials which contain lots of free volume prone to crazing, typically glassy brittle polymers.<ref name=Meyers>Meyers, Chawla. ''Mechanical Behavior of Materials.'' Cambridge University Press. pg 420-425. 1999</ref> In [[thermoplastic elastomer]], phase separation of dissimilar [[monomer]] components leads to association of hard domains within a sea of soft phase, yielding a physical structure with increased strength and rigidity. If yielding occurs by chains sliding past each other (shear bands), the strength can also be increased by introducing kinks into the polymer chains via unsaturated carbon-carbon bonds.<ref name=Meyers/>\n\nAdding [[Filler (materials)|filler materials]] such as fibers, platelets, and particles is a commonly employed technique for strengthening polymer materials. Fillers such as clay, silica, and carbon network materials have been extensively researched and used in polymer composites in part due to their effect on mechanical properties. Stiffness-confinement effects near rigid interfaces, such as those between a polymer matrix and stiffer filler materials, enhance the stiffness of composites by restricting polymer chain motion.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.110.108303|pmid=23521308|title=Effect of Nanoconfinement on Polymer Dynamics: Surface Layers and Interphases|journal=Physical Review Letters|volume=110|issue=10|pages=108303|year=2013|last1=Krutyeva|first1=M.|last2=Wischnewski|first2=A.|last3=Monkenbusch|first3=M.|last4=Willner|first4=L.|last5=Maiz|first5=J.|last6=Mijangos|first6=C.|last7=Arbe|first7=A.|last8=Colmenero|first8=J.|last9=Radulescu|first9=A.|last10=Holderer|first10=O.|last11=Ohl|first11=M.|last12=Richter|first12=D.|hdl=10261/102483}}</ref> This is especially present where fillers are chemically treated to strongly interact with polymer chains, increasing the anchoring of polymer chains to the filler interfaces and thus further restricting the motion of chains away from the interface.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1039/C5PY01631B|title=Toughening of photo-curable polymer networks: A review|journal=Polymer Chemistry|volume=7|issue=2|pages=257\u2013286|year=2016|last1=Ligon-Auer|first1=Samuel Clark|last2=Schwentenwein|first2=Martin|last3=Gorsche|first3=Christian|last4=Stampfl|first4=J\u00fcrgen|last5=Liska|first5=Robert}}</ref> Stiffness-confinement effects have been characterized in model nanocomposites, and shows that composites with length scales on the order of nanometers increase the effect of the fillers on polymer stiffness dramatically.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1021/acs.macromol.7b00917|title=Stiffness Gradients in Glassy Polymer Model Nanocomposites: Comparisons of Quantitative Characterization by Fluorescence Spectroscopy and Atomic Force Microscopy|journal=Macromolecules|volume=50|issue=14|pages=5447\u20135458|year=2017|last1=Zhang|first1=Min|last2=Askar|first2=Shadid|last3=Torkelson|first3=John M.|last4=Brinson|first4=L. Catherine}}</ref>\n\nIncreasing the bulkiness of the [[monomer]] unit via incorporation of aryl rings is another strengthening mechanism. The [[anisotropy]] of the molecular structure means that these mechanisms are heavily dependent on the direction of applied stress. While aryl rings drastically increase rigidity along the direction of the chain, these materials may still be brittle in perpendicular directions. Macroscopic structure can be adjusted to compensate for this [[anisotropy]]. For example, the high strength of [[Kevlar]] arises from a stacked multilayer macrostructure where aromatic polymer layers are rotated with respect to their neighbors. When loaded oblique to the chain direction, ductile polymers with flexible linkages, such as oriented [[polyethylene]], are highly prone to shear band formation, so macroscopic structures which place the load parallel to the draw direction would increase strength.<ref name=Meyers/> \n\nMixing polymers is another method of increasing strength, particularly with materials that show crazing preceding brittle fracture such as atactic [[polystyrene]] (APS). For example, by forming a 50/50 mixture of APS with polyphenylene oxide (PPO), this embrittling tendency can be almost completely suppressed, substantially increasing the fracture strength.<ref name=Meyers/>\n\n[[Interpenetrating polymer network|Interpenetrating polymer networks]] (IPNs), consisting of interlacing crosslinked polymer networks that are not covalently bonded to one another, can lead to enhanced strength in polymer materials. The use of an IPN approach imposes compatibility (and thus macroscale homogeneity) on otherwise immiscible blends, allowing for a blending of mechanical properties. For example, silicone-polyurethane IPNs show increased tear and flexural strength over base silicone networks, while preserving the high elastic recovery of the silicone network at high strains.<ref>{{cite book |doi=10.1021/ba-1990-0224.ch010|chapter=Polysiloxane\u2014Thermoplastic Interpenetrating Polymer Networks|title=Silicon-Based Polymer Science|volume=224|pages=181\u2013199|series=Advances in Chemistry|year=1989|last1=Arkles|first1=Barry|last2=Crosby|first2=Jane|isbn=0-8412-1546-4}}</ref> Increased stiffness can also be achieved by pre-straining polymer networks and then sequentially forming a secondary network within the strained material. This takes advantage of the anisotropic strain hardening of the original network (chain alignment from stretching of the polymer chains) and provides a mechanism whereby the two networks transfer stress to one another due to the imposed strain on the pre-strained network.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1002/polb.21943|title=Mechanical and thermo-mechanical studies of double networks based on thermoplastic elastomers|journal=Journal of Polymer Science Part B: Polymer Physics|volume=48|issue=7|pages=778\u2013789|year=2010|last1=Singh|first1=Naveen K.|last2=Lesser|first2=Alan J.}}</ref>\n\n===Glass===\n\nMany silicate glasses are strong in compression but weak in tension. By introducing compression stress into the structure, the tensile strength of the material can be increased. This is typically done via two mechanisms: thermal treatment (tempering) or chemical bath (via ion exchange). \n\nIn tempered glasses, air jets are used to rapidly cool the top and bottom surfaces of a softened (hot) slab of glass. Since the surface cools quicker, there is more free volume at the surface than in the bulk melt.  The core of the slab then pulls the surface inward, resulting in an internal compressive stress at the surface. This substantially increases the tensile strength of the material as tensile stresses exerted on the glass must now resolve the compressive stresses before yielding.\n\n<math> \\sigma_{y=modified}  = \\sigma_{y,0} + \\sigma_{compressive} </math>\n\nAlternately, in chemical treatment, a glass slab treated containing network formers and modifiers is submerged into a molten salt bath containing ions larger than those present in the modifier. Due to a concentration gradient of the ions, mass transport must take place. As the larger cation diffuses from the molten salt into the surface, it replaces the smaller ion from the modifier. The larger ion squeezing into surface introduces compressive stress in the glass's surface. A common example is treatment of sodium oxide modified silicate glass in molten [[potassium chloride]].\n\n== Composite strengthening  ==\n\nMany of the basic strengthening mechanisms can be classified based on their dimensionality. At 0-D there is precipitate and solid solution strengthening with particulates strengthening structure, at 1-D there is work/forest hardening with line dislocations as the hardening mechanism, and at 2-D there is grain boundary strengthening with surface energy of granular interfaces providing strength improvement. The two primary types of composite strengthening, fiber reinforcement and laminar reinforcement, fall in the 1-D and 2-D classes, respectively. The anisotropy of fiber and laminar composite strength reflects these dimensionalities. The primary idea behind composite strengthening is to combine materials with opposite strengths and weaknesses to create a material which transfers load onto the stiffer material but benefits from the ductility and toughness of the softer material. <ref name=\"courtney\">{{cite book |last1=Courtney |first1=Thomas H |title=Mechanical Behavior of Materials |date=1990 |publisher=Waveland Press Inc. |location=Long Grove, IL |edition=2nd}}</ref>\n\n=== Fiber reinforcement ===\n{{main|Fiber-reinforced composite}}\nFiber-reinforced composites (FRCs) consist of a matrix of one material containing parallel embedded fibers. There are two variants of fiber-reinforced composites, one with stiff fibers and a ductile matrix and one with ductile fibers and a stiff matrix. The former variant is exemplified by fiberglass which contains very strong but delicate glass fibers embedded in a softer plastic matrix resilient to fracture. The latter variant is found in almost all buildings as reinforced concrete with ductile, high tensile-strength steel rods embedded in brittle, high compressive-strength concrete. In both cases, the matrix and fibers have complimentary mechanical properties and the resulting composite material is therefore more practical for applications in the real world.\n\nFor a composite containing aligned, stiff fibers which span the length of the material and a soft, ductile matrix, the following descriptions provide a rough model.\n\n==== Four stages of deformation ====\nThe condition of a fiber-reinforced composite under applied tensile stress along the direction of the fibers can be decomposed into four stages from small strain to large strain. Since the stress is parallel to the fibers, the deformation is described by the isostrain condition, i.e., the fiber and matrix experience the same strain. At each stage, the composite stress (<math> \\sigma_{c} </math>) is given in terms of the volume fractions of the fiber and matrix (<math> V_{f}, V_{m}  </math>), the Young's moduli of the fiber and matrix (<math> E_{f}, E_{m}  </math>), the strain of the composite (<math> \\epsilon_{c}  </math>), and the stress of the fiber and matrix as read from a stress-strain curve (<math> \\sigma_{f}(\\epsilon_{c}), \\sigma_{m}(\\epsilon_{c})  </math>).\n\n# Both fiber and composite remain in the elastic strain regime. In this stage, we also note that the composite Young's modulus is a simple weighted sum of the two component moduli.\n#:<math> \\sigma_{c} = V_{f}\\epsilon_{c}E_{f} +  V_{m}\\epsilon_{c}E_{m} </math> <ref name=\"courtney\"/>\n#:<math> E_{c} = V_{f}E_{f} +  V_{m}E_{m} </math> <ref name=\"courtney\"/>\n# The fiber remains in the elastic regime but the matrix yields and plastically deforms.\n#:<math> \\sigma_{c} = V_{f}\\epsilon_{c}E_{f} +  V_{m}\\sigma_{m}(\\epsilon_{c}) </math> <ref name=\"courtney\"/>\n# Both fiber and composite yield and plastically deform. This stage often features significant Poisson strain which is not captured by model below.\n#:<math> \\sigma_{c} = V_{f}\\sigma_{f}(\\epsilon_{c}) +  V_{m}\\sigma_{m}(\\epsilon_{c}) </math> <ref name=\"courtney\"/>\n# The fiber fractures while the matrix continues to plastically deform. While in reality the fractured pieces of fiber still contribute some strength, it is left out of this simple model.\n#:<math> \\sigma_{c} \\approx V_{m}\\sigma_{m}(\\epsilon_{c}) </math><ref name=\"courtney\"/>\n\n==== Tensile strength ====\nDue to the heterogeneous nature of FRCs, they also feature multiple tensile strengths (TS), one corresponding to each component. Given the assumptions outlined above, the first tensile strength would correspond to failure of the fibers, with some support from the matrix plastic deformation strength, and the second with failure of the matrix.\n\n:<math>TS_1 = V_fTS_f + V_m\\sigma_m(\\epsilon_c) </math> <ref name=\"courtney\"/>\n\n:<math>TS_2 = V_mTS_m </math> <ref name=\"courtney\"/>\n\n==== Anisotropy (Orientation effects) ====\nAs a result of the aforementioned dimensionality (1-D) of fiber reinforcement, significant anisotropy is observed in its mechanical properties. The following equations model the tensile strength of a FRC as a function of the misalignment angle (<math>\\theta</math>) between the fibers and the applied force, the stresses in the parallel and perpendicular, or <math>\\theta=0</math> and <math>90</math>{{sup|o}}, cases (<math>\\ \\sigma_{||}, \\sigma_{\\perp}</math>), and the shear strength of the matrix (<math> \\tau_{my} </math>).\n\n;:Small Misalignment Angle (longitudinal fracture)\n: The angle is small enough to maintain load transfer onto the fibers and prevent delamination of fibers ''and'' the misaligned stress samples a slightly larger cross-sectional area of the fiber so the strength of the fiber is not just maintained but actually increases compared to the parallel case.\n: <math>TS(\\theta) = \\frac{\\sigma_{||}}{\\cos^2(\\theta)}</math> <ref name=\"courtney\"/>\n\n;:Significant Misalignment Angle (shear failure)\n: The angle is large enough that the load is not effectively transferred to the fibers and the matrix experiences enough strain to fracture.\n: <math>TS(\\theta) = \\frac{\\tau_{my}}{\\sin(\\theta)\\cos(\\theta)} </math> <ref name=\"courtney\"/>\n\n;:Near Perpendicular Misaligment Angle (transverse fracture)\n: The angle is close to 90{{sup|o}} so most of the load remains in the matrix and thus tensile transverse matrix fracture is the dominant failure condition. This can be seen as complementary to the small angle case, with similar form but with an angle <math>90-\\theta</math>.\n: <math>TS(\\theta) = \\frac{\\sigma_{\\perp}}{\\sin^2(\\theta)}</math> <ref name=\"courtney\"/>\n\n=== Laminar reinforcement ===\n{{Missing information|laminar reinforcement|date=May 2019}}\n\n==Applications and current research==\n\nStrengthening of materials is useful in many applications. A primary application of strengthened materials is for construction. In order to have stronger buildings and bridges, one must have a strong frame that can support high tensile or compressive load and resist plastic deformation. The steel frame used to make the building should be as strong as possible so that it does not bend under the entire weight of the building. Polymeric roofing materials would also need to be strong so that the roof does not cave in when there is build-up of snow on the rooftop.\n\nResearch is also currently being done to increase the strength of metallic materials through the addition of polymer materials such as bonded carbon fiber reinforced polymer to (CFRP)[https://archive.today/20130202115814/http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&_udi=B6V2G-4GX6HXM-8&_user=501045&_coverDate=03/31/2006&_rdoc=1&_fmt=&_orig=search&_sort=d&view=c&_acct=C000022659&_version=1&_urlVersion=0&_userid=501045&md5=f938f165c8666c9fa0174d293e45297b%23bib4].\n\n===Molecular dynamics simulations===\nThe use of computation simulations to model work hardening in materials allows for the direct observation of critical elements that rule the process of strengthening materials.  The basic reasoning derives from the fact that, when examining plasticity and the movement of dislocations in materials, a focus on the atomistic level is many times not accounted for and the focus rests on the contiuum description of materials.  Since the practice of tracking these atomistic effects in experiments and theorizing about them in textbooks cannot provide a full understanding of these interactions, many turn to molecular dynamics simulations to develop this understanding.<ref name=Buehler>Buehler, Markus J. ''the dynamical complexity of work - hardening:  a large-scale molecular dynamics simulation.'' Acta Mech Sinica. pg 103-111. 2005</ref>\n\nThe simulations work by utilizing the known atomic interactions between any two atoms and the relationship F = ma, so that the dislocations moving through the material are ruled by simple mechanical actions and reactions of the atoms.  The [[interatomic potential]] usually utilized to estimate these interactions is the Lennard \u2013 Jones 12:6 potential.  Lennard \u2013 Jones is widely accepted because its experimental shortcomings are well-known.<ref name=Buehler/><ref name=Abraham>Abraham, F.  \"Simulating materials failure by using up to one billion atoms and the world's fastest computer: Work-hardening.\"  Proc Natl Acad Sci.  pg 5783\u20135787. 2002</ref>  These interactions are simply scaled up to millions or billions of atoms in some cases to simulate materials more accurately.  \n\nMolecular dynamic simulations display the interactions based upon the governing equations provided above for the strengthening mechanisms.  They provide an effective way to see these mechanisms in action outside the painstaking realm of direct observation during experiments.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Grain boundary strengthening]]\n*[[Precipitation strengthening]]\n*[[Solid solution strengthening]]\n*[[Strength of materials]]\n*[[Tempering (metallurgy)]]\n*[[Work hardening]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|40em}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/311/5758/212 Grain boundary strengthening in alumina by rare earth impurities]\n*[https://doi.org/10.1007%2FBF00801481 Mechanism of grain boundary strengthening of steels]\n*[http://zambaldi.de/software/stabix/ An open source Matlab toolbox for analysis of slip transfer through grain boundaries]\n\n[[Category:Materials science]]\n[[Category:Strengthening mechanisms of materials|*]]\n", "name_user": "Salbayeng", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eGlass:added cross links to other wikipages using an examples sentence.", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strengthening_mechanisms_of_materials"}

[[Craig Kallman]] wanted to include a track that pays homage to her Latin heritage and searched among his Latin music collection of records that he used to play when he was a DJ. Decided for Pete Rodriguez's \"[[I Like It Like That (Pete Rodriguez song)|I Like It Like That]]\" and \"Oh That's Nice\", he added J White to the production process. The sample of the former song \"over a very rough instrumental\" and with a Cardi verse on it was sent to musician Edgar Machuca.

[[Craig Kallman]] wanted to include a track that pays homage to her Latin heritage and searched among his Latin music collection of records that he used to play when he was a DJ. Decided for Pete Rodriguez's \"[[I Like It Like That (Pete Rodriguez song)|I Like It Like That]]\" and \"Oh That's Nice\", he added J White to the production process. The sample of the former song \"over a very rough instrumental\" and with a Cardi verse on it was sent to musician Edgar Machuca. White and Machuca worked on the production, chopping up the sample and trying to \"make the song sound better and cohesive and beef up the production.\" Cardi re-wrote the [[hook (music)|hook]] a number of times and cut vocals, eventually choosing the chorus she was most comfortable with. The three producers looped the \"I Like It\" part as they felt that was the catchiest part of the sample. Machucha proposed to add Bad Bunny and J Balvin to the track, with both artists contributing with their verses and ideas. [[Tainy]] and Invicible finished working on the production focusing on the instrumentals. Work on the record started in October 2017, and finished in early April 2018.<ref name=\"recording\">{{Cite news |url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/latin/8471835/cardi-b-i-like-it-oral-history |title=Cardi B's 'I Like It': An Oral History of No. 1 Smash's Grueling Seven-Month Gestation |last=LeDonne |first=Rob |date=August 28, 2018 |work=Billboard |accessdate=August 30, 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Production==\n\"I Like It\" is a [[Latin trap]] song.<ref>{{cite web|title=Invasion of Privacy AllMusic Review|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/invasion-of-privacy-mw0003166060|website=[[AllMusic]]|last=Yeung|first=Neil Z.|accessdate=April 8, 2018}}</ref> It is a blend of [[trap music|trap]] and [[salsa (music)|salsa]], and samples 1960s [[boogaloo]] song \"[[I Like It Like That (Pete Rodriguez song)|I Like It Like That]]\".<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/apr/06/cardi-b-invasion-of-privacy-album-review |title=Cardi B: Invasion of Privacy review \u2013 Bronx Cinderella grinds her heel into hip-hop sexism |work=[[The Guardian]] |last=Beaumont-Thomas |first=Ben |date=April 6, 2018 |accessdate=April 6, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Levine|first=Nick|title=Cardi B \u2013 'Invasion Of Privacy' Review|url=http://www.nme.com/reviews/album/cardi-b-invasion-of-privacy-review|website=[[NME]]|accessdate=April 9, 2018}}</ref> As noted by a ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' editor, the song is \"heavily indebted to the world of [[Latin hip hop]].\" Bad Bunny raps in English and Spanish, while J Balvin performs in Spanish.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/latin/8292613/cardi-b-bad-bunny-j-balvin-i-like-it-lyrics |title=Cardi B's 'I Like It' With Bad Bunny and J Balvin Goes Beyond Liking Material Things: See Lyrics |last=Fernandez |first=Suzette |date=April 6, 2018 |work=Billboard |access-date=April 14, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/list/8459289/best-songs-of-2018-top-50 |title=The 50 Best Songs of 2018 (So Far): Critics' Picks |date=June 6, 2018 |work=Billboard |accessdate=June 20, 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Critical reception==\n\"I Like It\" received positive reviews from critics.

Daly described the single as a \"mix of modern and classic\".<ref name=\"NME review\"/> Writing for ''[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]'', Michelle Kim criticized the song, saying Mars \"attempts to make his own bump'n'grind anthem\" but that \"his request feels painfully safe and vanilla, like if a bot was programmed to write sexts\". Kim summarized that the song has an \"awkward tempo\" and is \"definitely not sexy enough to be played in the bedroom\".<ref name=\"Pitchfork\">{{cite web|url=https://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/please-me/|title=\"Please Me\" by Cardi B / Bruno Mars Review|website=Pitchfork|last=Kim|first=Michelle|date=February 16, 2019|accessdate=February 17, 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Music video==\nThe music video premiered on March 1, 2019 on [[YouTube]].

The song was written by Mars, [[Philip Lawrence (songwriter)|Philip Lawrence]], Christopher Brody Brown, [[James Fauntleroy]], Jonathan Yip, Ray Romulus, Jeremy Reeves and Ray McCullough II. The former three produced the it under the name Shampoo Press & Curl, along with the latter four, as [[The Stereotypes]]. The song was composed after a jam session as Mars wanted to recreate the \"[[new jack swing]] sound\". Atlantic Records released a remix version, featuring verses from American rapper [[Cardi B]], as the album's fith and final single on January 4, 2018, to [[Music download|digital download]] and [[Streaming media|streaming services]]. Musically, it is a new jack swing, [[hip hop soul]] and [[funk]] song with a light influence of [[Contemporary R&B|R&B]]. The lyrics demonstrate the happiness of being with who one loves and the positive outcome of that for them and others.\n\n\"Finesse\" was well received by [[music journalism|music critics]], who complimented Cardi B's verses, on the remix, and compared them to the old-school [[Hip hop music|hip hop]] flow. Moreover, according to critics, the song evokes the sound of [[Bobby Brown]]'s album ''[[Don't Be Cruel (album)|Don't Be Cruel]]'' (1988), [[Bell Biv DeVoe]]'s track \"[[Poison (Bell Biv DeVoe song)|Poison]]\" (1990), and [[Michael Jackson]]'s \"[[Remember the Time]]\" (1992). The song was a commercial success, peaking at number two in New Zealand, number three in the United States and Canada. Is has also entered the top ten of Australia, Ireland, Netherlands and the United Kingdom. The song was certified four and three times platinum by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA) and [[Australian Recording Industry Association]] (ARIA), respectively. It was also certified platinum by both the [[British Phonographic Industry]] (BPI) and the [[Recorded Music NZ]] (RMNZ).\n\nThe accompanying [[music video]], which was directed by Florent Dechard and Mars, pays homage to the popular [[Fox Broadcasting Company|FOX]] sketch comedy television series ''[[In Living Color]]'' (1990\u20131994). To promote \"Finesse\", Mars and Cardi B performed it at the [[60th Annual Grammy Awards]]. In 2018, the song was included on a medley of hits performed by Cardi B at the iHeart Music Awards and by Kelly Clarkson at the [[Billboard Music Awards|''Billboard'' Music Awards]]. It received several nominations and awards, winning [[American Music Award for Favorite Soul/R&B Song|Favorite Song Soul/R&B]] at the [[2018 American Music Awards]], [[Soul Train Music Award for Best Video of the Year|Video of the Year]] at the [[2018 Soul Train Music Awards]], as well as Best Collaboration at the [[2019 iHeartRadio Music Awards]].\n\n==Background and development==\nIn September 2014, Mars tweeted, \"Now it's time to start writing chapter 3\", hinting he was working on new music. Following the release of the successful [[Mark Ronson]] and Mars' featured single \"[[Uptown Funk]]\" (2014), Mars headed to the studio to record more songs, and said he had no plans to release a new album \"until it's done\". The album was due in March 2016, but Mars' appearance at the Super Bowl halftime show postponed it for several months. At the time, seven songs were already recorded.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/7534116/bruno-mars-third-album-timeline-24k-magic|title=What We Know About The New Bruno Mars Album So Far|last=Redfearn|first=Dominique|work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|date=October 6, 2016|accessdate=June 9, 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180429084606/https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/7534116/bruno-mars-third-album-timeline-24k-magic|archivedate=April 29, 2018}}</ref>\n\n[[The Stereotypes]] had known Mars and worked with him since 2007, but after he signed a deal with [[Atlantic Records]], in 2009, they did not collaborate very often.<ref name=\"SUDK\">{{cite web|url=http://www.songwriteruniverse.com/stereotypes-producers-interview-2017.htm|title=Hit Writing/Producing Team The Stereotypes Co-Write & Produce Bruno Mars' #1 Hit \"That's What I Like,\" And Receive 3 Grammy Nominations|last=Kawashima|first=Dale|work=Songwriter Universe|date=December 4, 2017|accessdate=June 9, 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180710184649/http://www.songwriteruniverse.com/stereotypes-producers-interview-2017.htm|archivedate=July 10, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hitquarters.com/index.php3?page=intrview/opar/intrview_AaronBaySchuck_int.html|title=Interview with Aaron Bay-Schuck|publisher=[[HitQuarters]]|date=December 13, 2010|accessdate=December 14, 2010|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20190521053612/http://www.hitquarters.com/index.php3?page=intrview/opar/intrview_AaronBaySchuck_int.html|archivedate=May 21, 2019|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref> In 2015, Jonathan Yip of the team talked with Mars about working together.

The live show ended with Cardi B rapping verses of her single, \"[[Bartier Cardi]]\" (2017).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/grammys-2018-watch-bruno-mars-cardi-bs-colorful-finesse-performance-w515868|title=Grammys 2018: Watch Bruno Mars, Cardi B's Colorful 'Finesse' Performance|last=Spanos|first=Brittany|work=Rolling Stone|date=January 29, 2018|accessdate=January 29, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180129034428/https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/grammys-2018-watch-bruno-mars-cardi-bs-colorful-finesse-performance-w515868|archive-date=January 29, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/grammys-bruno-mars-cardi-b-give-colorful-performance-finesse-1079461|title=Grammys: Bruno Mars, Cardi B Give Colorful Performance of \"Finesse\"|last=Perez|first=Lexy|work=The Hollywood Reporter|date=January 28, 2018|accessdate=October 6, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191006165505/https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/grammys-bruno-mars-cardi-b-give-colorful-performance-finesse-1079461|archive-date=October 6, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=\"BBCP\">{{cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/grammys/8096768/grammys-2018-bruno-mars-cardi-b-finesse|title=Watch Bruno Mars & Cardi B Perform 'Finesse' at 2018 Grammy Awards|last=Payne|first=Chris|work=Billboard|date=January 28, 2018|accessdate=October 6, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191005235953/https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/grammys/8096768/grammys-2018-bruno-mars-cardi-b-finesse|archive-date=October 5, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> The performance received positive reviews, who found it similar to the 1990s theme of the music video.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.spin.com/2018/01/grammys-2018-cardi-b-and-bruno-mars-perform-finesse-remix-video/|title=Grammys 2018: Watch Bruno Mars and Cardi B Perform \"Finesse (Remix)\"|last=Gordon|first=Arielle|work=[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]|date=January 28, 2018|accessdate=October 6, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191005235951/https://www.spin.com/2018/01/grammys-2018-cardi-b-and-bruno-mars-perform-finesse-remix-video/|archive-date=October 5, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=\"BBCP\"/><ref name=\"PeopleMP\"/> Chris Payne of ''Billboard'' commented, \"In one of the most captivating moments if the 2018 Grammys combined for an action-packed, '90s-tastic performance.\"<ref name=\"BBCP\"/> Writing for ''Vibe'', J'na Jefferson dubbed the performance as \"stand-out\", while ''[[People (magazine)|People]]''{{'s}} Maria Pasquine wrote, \"The duo, who broke the internet with their ''In Living Color''-inspired video, tore up the Grammys stage.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.vibe.com/2018/01/bruno-mars-cardi-b-grammys|title=Bruno Mars And Cardi B Bring Funk And 'Finesse' To Grammys Performance|last=Jefferson|first=J'na|work=Vibe|date=January 28, 2018|accessdate=October 6, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190620084722/https://www.vibe.com/2018/01/bruno-mars-cardi-b-grammys|archive-date=June 20, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=\"PeopleMP\">{{cite web|url=https://people.com/music/grammys-2018-bruno-mars-cardi-b-finesse-performance/|title=Bruno Mars and Cardi B Dress in '90s Gear to Perform 'Finesse' at the Grammy Awards|last=Pasquini|first=Maria|work=[[People (magazine)|People]]|date=January 28, 2018|accessdate=October 6, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191002014305/https://people.com/music/grammys-2018-bruno-mars-cardi-b-finesse-performance/|archive-date=October 2, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> Charles Holmes from [[MTV News]] praised the performance, affirming that \"the chemistry between Cardi and Mars was so electric the duo should think about dropping a collaboration album to save 2018\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/3061076/bruno-mars-cardi-b-finesse-grammy-performance/|title=Cardi B Didn't Win a Grammy, but her \"Finesse \" Performance won the Grammys|last=Holmes|first=Charles|publisher=MTV News|date=January 28, 2018|accessdate=October 6, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191005235953/http://www.mtv.com/news/3061076/bruno-mars-cardi-b-finesse-grammy-performance/|archive-date=October 5, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> Cardi B confessed that she was nervous during the performance and decided to use a common stage fright technique in picking a blank spot in the crowd.

The song was written by Mars, [[Philip Lawrence (songwriter)|Philip Lawrence]], Christopher Brody Brown, [[James Fauntleroy]], Jonathan Yip, Ray Romulus, Jeremy Reeves and Ray McCullough II. The former three produced the it under the name Shampoo Press & Curl, along with the latter four, as [[The Stereotypes]]. The song was composed after a jam session as Mars wanted to recreate the \"[[new jack swing]] sound\". Atlantic Records released a remix version, featuring verses from American rapper [[Cardi B]], as the album's fith and final single on January 4, 2018, to [[Music download|digital download]] and [[Streaming media|streaming services]]. Musically, it is a new jack swing, [[hip hop soul]] and [[funk]] song with a light influence of [[Contemporary R&B|R&B]]. The lyrics demonstrate the happiness of being with who one loves and the positive outcome of that for them and others.\n\n\"Finesse\" was well received by [[music journalism|music critics]], who complimented Cardi B's verses, on the remix, and compared them to the old-school [[Hip hop music|hip hop]] flow. Moreover, according to critics, the song evokes the sound of [[Bobby Brown]]'s album ''[[Don't Be Cruel (album)|Don't Be Cruel]]'' (1988), [[Bell Biv DeVoe]]'s track \"[[Poison (Bell Biv DeVoe song)|Poison]]\" (1990), and [[Michael Jackson]]'s \"[[Remember the Time]]\" (1992). The song was a commercial success, peaking at number two in New Zealand, number three in the United States and Canada. Is has also entered the top ten of Australia, Ireland, Netherlands and the United Kingdom. The song was certified four and three times platinum by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA) and [[Australian Recording Industry Association]] (ARIA), respectively. It was also certified platinum by both the [[British Phonographic Industry]] (BPI) and the [[Recorded Music NZ]] (RMNZ).\n\nThe accompanying [[music video]], which was directed by Florent Dechard and Mars, pays homage to the popular [[Fox Broadcasting Company|FOX]] sketch comedy television series ''[[In Living Color]]'' (1990\u20131994). To promote \"Finesse\", Mars and Cardi B performed it at the [[60th Annual Grammy Awards]]. In 2018, the song was included on a medley of hits performed by Cardi B at the iHeart Music Awards and by Kelly Clarkson at the [[Billboard Music Awards|''Billboard'' Music Awards]]. It received several nominations and awards, winning [[American Music Award for Favorite Soul/R&B Song|Favorite Song Soul/R&B]] at the [[2018 American Music Awards]], [[Soul Train Music Award for Best Video of the Year|Video of the Year]] at the [[2018 Soul Train Music Awards]], as well as Best Collaboration at the [[2019 iHeartRadio Music Awards]].\n\n==Background and development==\nIn September 2014, Mars tweeted, \"Now it's time to start writing chapter 3\", hinting he was working on new music. Following the release of the successful [[Mark Ronson]] and Mars' featured single \"[[Uptown Funk]]\" (2014), Mars headed to the studio to record more songs, and said he had no plans to release a new album \"until it's done\". The album was due in March 2016, but Mars' appearance at the Super Bowl halftime show postponed it for several months.

The live show ended with Cardi B rapping verses of her single, \"[[Bartier Cardi]]\" (2017).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/grammys-2018-watch-bruno-mars-cardi-bs-colorful-finesse-performance-w515868|title=Grammys 2018: Watch Bruno Mars, Cardi B's Colorful 'Finesse' Performance|last=Spanos|first=Brittany|work=Rolling Stone|date=January 29, 2018|accessdate=January 29, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180129034428/https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/grammys-2018-watch-bruno-mars-cardi-bs-colorful-finesse-performance-w515868|archive-date=January 29, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/grammys-bruno-mars-cardi-b-give-colorful-performance-finesse-1079461|title=Grammys: Bruno Mars, Cardi B Give Colorful Performance of \"Finesse\"|last=Perez|first=Lexy|work=The Hollywood Reporter|date=January 28, 2018|accessdate=October 6, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191006165505/https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/grammys-bruno-mars-cardi-b-give-colorful-performance-finesse-1079461|archive-date=October 6, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=\"BBCP\">{{cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/grammys/8096768/grammys-2018-bruno-mars-cardi-b-finesse|title=Watch Bruno Mars & Cardi B Perform 'Finesse' at 2018 Grammy Awards|last=Payne|first=Chris|work=Billboard|date=January 28, 2018|accessdate=October 6, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191005235953/https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/grammys/8096768/grammys-2018-bruno-mars-cardi-b-finesse|archive-date=October 5, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> The performance received positive reviews, who found it similar to the 1990s theme of the music video.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.spin.com/2018/01/grammys-2018-cardi-b-and-bruno-mars-perform-finesse-remix-video/|title=Grammys 2018: Watch Bruno Mars and Cardi B Perform \"Finesse (Remix)\"|last=Gordon|first=Arielle|work=[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]|date=January 28, 2018|accessdate=October 6, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191005235951/https://www.spin.com/2018/01/grammys-2018-cardi-b-and-bruno-mars-perform-finesse-remix-video/|archive-date=October 5, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=\"BBCP\"/><ref name=\"PeopleMP\"/> Chris Payne of ''Billboard'' commented, \"In one of the most captivating moments if the 2018 Grammys combined for an action-packed, '90s-tastic performance.\"<ref name=\"BBCP\"/> Writing for ''Vibe'', J'na Jefferson dubbed the performance as \"stand-out\", while ''[[People (magazine)|People]]''{{'s}} Maria Pasquine wrote, \"The duo, who broke the internet with their ''In Living Color''-inspired video, tore up the Grammys stage.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.vibe.com/2018/01/bruno-mars-cardi-b-grammys|title=Bruno Mars And Cardi B Bring Funk And 'Finesse' To Grammys Performance|last=Jefferson|first=J'na|work=Vibe|date=January 28, 2018|accessdate=October 6, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190620084722/https://www.vibe.com/2018/01/bruno-mars-cardi-b-grammys|archive-date=June 20, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=\"PeopleMP\">{{cite web|url=https://people.com/music/grammys-2018-bruno-mars-cardi-b-finesse-performance/|title=Bruno Mars and Cardi B Dress in '90s Gear to Perform 'Finesse' at the Grammy Awards|last=Pasquini|first=Maria|work=[[People (magazine)|People]]|date=January 28, 2018|accessdate=October 6, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191002014305/https://people.com/music/grammys-2018-bruno-mars-cardi-b-finesse-performance/|archive-date=October 2, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> Charles Holmes from [[MTV News]] praised the performance, affirming that \"the chemistry between Cardi and Mars was so electric the duo should think about dropping a collaboration album to save 2018\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/3061076/bruno-mars-cardi-b-finesse-grammy-performance/|title=Cardi B Didn't Win a Grammy, but her \"Finesse \" Performance won the Grammys|last=Holmes|first=Charles|publisher=MTV News|date=January 28, 2018|accessdate=October 6, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191005235953/http://www.mtv.com/news/3061076/bruno-mars-cardi-b-finesse-grammy-performance/|archive-date=October 5, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> Cardi B confessed that she was nervous during the performance and decided to use a common stage fright technique in picking a blank spot in the crowd.
