Despite the abortive attempts by his father Caliph [[Hisham ibn Abd al-Malik]] ({{reign|724|743}}) to install Maslama as his chosen successor in place of [[al-Walid II|al-Walid ibn Yazid]], Maslama became a close companion of al-Walid and defended him from his father's machinations. As a result, he was spared the fate of his brothers who were imprisoned upon al-Walid's accession in 743.

Umm Hakim, like her mother Zaynab bint Abd al-Rahman, was well known for her beauty, and her fondness for wine was the subject of contemporary poetic verses preserved in the ''[[Kitab al-aghani]]'' (Book of Songs) of [[Abu al-Faraj al-Isfahani]] (d. 967).{{sfn|Hillenbrand|1989|p=90, note 455}} Maslama was married to Umm Salama bint Ya'qub ibn Salama, a member of the aristocratic [[Banu Makhzum]]

It remains the only UK-designed-and-built fighter capable of [[Mach number|Mach 2]].  The Lightning was designed, developed, and manufactured by [[English Electric]], which was later absorbed by the newly-formed [[British Aircraft Corporation]]. Later the type was marketed as the '''BAC Lightning'''.  It was operated by the [[Royal Air Force]] (RAF), the [[Kuwait Air Force]] (KAF) and the [[Royal Saudi Air Force]] (RSAF).\n\nA unique feature of the Lightning's design is the vertical, staggered configuration of its two [[Rolls-Royce Avon]] [[turbojet]] engines within the fuselage. The Lightning was initially designed and developed as an interceptor to defend the [[V bomber]] airfields<ref>Note: at the time, the V bombers carried Britain's [[nuclear deterrent]] and thus were the likely first-strike targets of a Soviet air attack on the UK. In addition to the Lightning, last line-of-defence for the airfields was to be what became the [[Bloodhound (missile)|Bristol Bloodhound]] guided missile.</ref> from attack by anticipated future nuclear-armed supersonic Soviet bombers such as what emerged as the [[Tupolev Tu-22]], but it was subsequently also required to intercept other [[bomber]] aircraft such as the [[Tupolev Tu-16]] and the [[Tupolev Tu-95]]. The Lightning has exceptional [[rate of climb]], [[Ceiling (aeronautics)|ceiling]], and speed; pilots have described flying it as \"being saddled to a skyrocket\".<ref name= \"Winchester p. 82\" /> This performance and the initially limited fuel supply<ref>Note: the original specification only called for a 150-mile radius of action from the V bomber bases the aircraft was defending. [[Roland Beamont]] later called for the Lightning's fuel capacity to be greatly increased, which it was.</ref> made the Lightning a \"fuel-critical\" aircraft, meaning that its missions are dictated to a high degree by its limited range. Later developments provided greater range and speed along with [[aerial reconnaissance]] and [[Close air support|ground-attack]] capability.\n\nFollowing retirement by the RAF in the late 1980s, many of the remaining aircraft became museum exhibits. Until 2009, three Lightnings were kept flying at \"[[Thunder City]]\" in [[Cape Town]], South Africa. In September 2008, the [[Institution of Mechanical Engineers]] conferred on the Lightning its \"Engineering Heritage Award\" at a ceremony at [[BAE Systems]]' site at [[Warton Aerodrome]].<ref>Robinson, Ben.

Petter|W.E.W. \"Teddy\" Petter]], formerly chief designer at [[Westland Aircraft]], was a keen early proponent of Britain's need to develop a supersonic fighter aircraft. In 1947, Petter approached the [[Ministry of Supply (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Supply]] (MoS) with his proposal, and in response [[List of Air Ministry Specifications|Specification ER.103]] was issued for a single research aircraft, which was to be capable of flight at {{convert|1.5|Mach|50,000|km/h|0}} and {{convert|50000|ft}}.<ref>Darling 2000, pp. 6\u20137.</ref>\n\nPetter initiated a design proposal with [[Frederick Page|F W \"Freddie\" Page]] leading the design and [[Ray Creasey]] responsible for the aerodynamics.{{sfnp|Davies|2014|p=104}} By July 1948 their proposal incorporated the stacked engine configuration and a high-mounted tailplane but was designed for Mach 1.5. As a consequence it had a conventional 40\u00b0 swept wing {{sfnp|Davies|2014|p=102}} This proposal was submitted in the November {{sfnp|Ransom|1986|p=218}} and in January 1949 the project was designated P.1 by English Electric.{{sfnp|Ransom|1986|p=58}} On 29 March 1949 MoS granted approval for English Electric to start the detailed design, develop wind tunnel models and build a full-size mockup. The design that had developed during 1948 evolved further during 1949.{{sfnp|Ransom|1986|p=219}}{{sfnp|Davies|2014|p=104}} To achieve Mach 2 the wing sweep was increased to 60\u00b0 with the ailerons moved to the wingtips.{{sfnp|Davies|2014|p=103}} In late 1949 low-speed wind tunnel tests showed that a vortex was generated by the wing which caused a large downwash on the tailplane; this issue was solved by lowering its height below the wing.{{sfnp|Davies|2014|p=103}} Following the resignation of Petter, Page took over as design team leader for the P.1.<ref name=\"Darling 2000, pp. 8\u201310\">Darling 2000, pp. 8\u201310.</ref>\n\nIn 1949, the Ministry of Supply had issued Specification F23/49, which expanded upon the scope of ER103 to include fighter-level manoeuvring. On 1 April 1950, English Electric received a contract for two flying [[airframe]]s, as well as one static airframe, designated ''P.1.''<ref name=\"Darling 2000, pp. 8\u201310\" />\n\nThe [[Royal Aircraft Establishment]] was sceptical of Petter's swept wing concepts. To test the design of both the wing, the tailplane and to assess handling, [[Short Brothers]] were issued a contract to produce the [[Short SB5]] in mid-1950.<ref group=\"nb\">The SB5 was allocated serial number WG768 on 27 July 1950.</ref><ref>{{cite magazine|magazine=Air-Britain Aeromilitaria|volume=37|issue=145|title=Post-1950 Aircraft Specifications|author=Phil Butler|publisher=[[Air-Britain]]|pages=24\u201325|issn=0262-8791 }}</ref> This was a low-speed research aircraft and was designed so that different wing sweep angles could be assumed by the single aircraft. An assortment of tailplanes and wings were supplied and could be installed in order for their flight performance to be evaluated. However, following the first flight of the SB.5 on 2 December 1952, the trials demonstrated the choice of a tailplane and a 60-degree wingsweep and proved the design principles to be effective.<ref>Darling 2000, pp. 7\u20138.</ref>\n\n===Prototypes===\n[[File:English Electric P.1 (27898298121).jpg|thumb|P1A]]\nFrom 1953 onwards, the first three prototype aircraft were hand-built at [[Samlesbury]]. These aircraft had been assigned the [[United Kingdom military aircraft serial numbers|aircraft serials]] ''WG760'', ''WG763'', and ''WG765'' (the static airframe){{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}. The prototypes were powered by un-[[Afterburner|reheated]] [[Armstrong Siddeley Sapphire]] turbojets, as the selected [[Rolls-Royce Avon]] engines which powered subsequent production aircraft had fallen behind schedule due to their own development problems.<ref>Darling 2000, p. 10.</ref> Due to the limited internal space of the fuselage the fuel capacity was relatively small, giving the prototypes an extremely limited [[combat endurance|endurance]], and the narrow tyres housed in the thin wings rapidly wore out.<ref name=\"Scott 2000_13\">Scott 2000, p. 13.</ref> Outwardly, the prototypes looked very much like the production series, but they were distinguished by the rounded-triangular intakes, short fins and lack of operational equipment.<ref name= \"Winchester p. 82\" />\n\nOn 9 June 1952, it was decided that there would be a second phase of prototypes built to develop the aircraft towards achieving {{convert|2.0|Mach|km/h|0}}; these were designated ''P.1B'' while the initial three prototypes were retroactively reclassified as ''P.1A''.<ref>Darling 2000, pp. 16\u201317.</ref> P.1B was a significant improvement on P.1A. While it was similar in aerodynamics, structure and control systems, it incorporated extensive alterations to the forward fuselage, reheated Rolls Royce Avon R24R engines, a conical centre body [[inlet cone]], variable nozzle reheat and provision for weapons systems integrated with the [[air data computer|ADC]] and [[Airborne interception radar#AI.23|AI.23 radar]].{{sfnp|Beamont|1984|p=51-52}}<ref name =\"buttler 65\" /> Three P1B prototypes were built, assigned serials XA847, XA853 and XA856<ref name=\"Beamont 123\">Beamont 1985 p.123</ref>\n\nIn May 1954, ''WG760'' and its support equipment were moved to [[RAF Boscombe Down]] for pre-flight ground taxi trials; on the morning of 4 August 1954, ''WG760'', piloted by [[Roland Beamont]], flew for the first time from Boscombe Down.<ref>Darling 2000, pp. 10\u201312.</ref> One week later, ''WG760'' officially achieved [[supersonic]] flight for the first time, having exceeded the [[speed of sound]] during its third flight.<ref name =\"buttler 65\">Buttler 2000, p. 65.</ref> During its first flight, ''WG760'' had unknowingly exceeded {{convert|1|Mach|km/h|0}}, but due to [[position error]] the [[Machmeter|Mach meter]] only showed a maximum of {{convert|0.95|Mach|km/h|0}}. The occurrence was noticed during flight data analysis a few days later.<ref>[http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1957/1957%20-%200541.html \"Progress with the P.1\"] ''Flight'', 26 April 1957, p.&nbsp;543.</ref> While ''WG760'' had proven the P.1 design to be viable, it was limited to {{convert|1.51|Mach|km/h|0}} due to [[directional stability]] limits. In May 1956, the P.1 received the \"Lightning\" name, which was said to have been partially selected to reflect the aircraft's supersonic capabilities.<ref name =\"buttler 66\">Buttler 2000, p. 66.</ref>\n\nOn 4 April 1957 Beamont made the first flight of the P.1B (XA847) exceeding Mach 1 during this flight.{{sfnp|Flight|26 April 1957}}{{sfnp|Beamont|1985|p=56-57}} On 25 November he reached Mach 2, {{sfnp|Beamont|1985|p=67}} the first time in a British aircraft.<ref name= \"Winchester p. 82\" /> During the early flight trials of the P.1B speeds in excess of 1,000&nbsp;mph were achieved daily. During this period the [[Fairey FD2]] delta held the world speed record (1,132&nbsp;mph achieved on 10 March 1956 and held till December 1957). While the P.1B was potentially faster than the FD2, it lacked the fuel capacity to provide one run in each direction at maximum speed to claim the record in accordance with international rules.{{sfnp|Beamont|1985|p=59}}\n\nIn 1958 two test pilots from the USAF [[Air Force Flight Test Center]], Andy Anderson and [[Deke Slayton]], were given the opportunity to familiarise themselves with the P1B. Slayton, who was subsequently selected as one of the [[Project Mercury|Mercury]] astronauts, commented:\n\n{{quote|The P.1 was a terrific plane, with the easy handling of the F-86 and the performance of an F-104.

To best perform this intercept mission, emphasis was placed on rate-of-climb, acceleration, and speed, rather than [[range (aeronautics)|range]] \u2013 originally a radius of operation of {{convert|150|mi}} from the V bomber airfields was specified \u2013 and [[combat endurance]]. It was equipped with two 30&nbsp;mm ADEN cannon in front of the cockpit windscreen and an interchangeable fuselage weapons pack containing either an additional two ADEN cannon, 48 {{convert|2|in|adj=on|spell=in}} unguided air-to-air rockets, or two [[de Havilland Firestreak]] [[air-to-air missile]]s;<ref name=\"Scott 2000_119\">Scott 2000, pp. 119\u2013129.</ref> a heavy loadout optimised for damaging large aircraft. The [[Ferranti]] [[AI.23]] onboard radar provided [[missile guidance]] and ranging, as well as search and track functions.<ref name= \"Pilot's Notes, F.1\" />\n\nThe next two Lightning variants, the ''Lightning F.1A'' and ''F.2'', were steady but relatively minor refinements of the design; the next variant, the ''Lightning F.3'', was a major departure. The F.3 had higher thrust [[Rolls-Royce Avon]] 301R engines, a larger squared-off fin and strengthened [[inlet cone]] allowing a service clearance to {{convert|2.0|Mach|km/h|0}} (the F.1, F.1A and F.2 were limited to {{convert|1.7|Mach|km/h|0}}).<ref name= \"Pilot's Notes, F.3\">''Pilot's Notes, Lightning F.Mk.3''. Warton Aerodrome, UK: English Electric Technical Services, April 1965.</ref> The A.I.23B radar and [[Red Top missile]] offered a forward hemisphere attack capability and deletion of the nose cannon. The new engines and fin made the F.3 the highest performance Lightning yet, but with an even higher fuel consumption and resulting shorter range. The next variant, the ''Lightning F.6'', was already in development, but there was a need for an interim solution to partially address the F.3's shortcomings, the ''F.3A''.\n\n[[File:English Electric Lightning F3, UK - Air Force AN1127832.jpg|thumb|left|Lightning F.3 in flight, 1983]]\nThe F.3A introduced two improvements: a new, non-jettisonable, {{convert|610|impgal|L|adj=on}} ventral fuel tank,<ref name= \"Pilot's Notes, F.6\">''Pilot's Notes, Lightning F.Mk.6''. Warton Aerodrome, UK: English Electric Technical Services, September 1966.</ref> and a new, kinked, conically cambered wing leading edge, incorporating a slightly larger [[leading edge]] fuel tank, raising the total usable internal fuel by {{convert|716|impgal|L}}. The conically cambered wing improved manoeuvrability, especially at higher altitudes, and the ventral tank nearly doubled available fuel. The increased fuel was welcome, but the lack of cannon armament was felt to be a deficiency. It was thought that cannons were desirable to fire warning shots in the intercept mission.<ref>Williams and Gustin 2004, p. 106.</ref>\n\nThe ''Lightning F.6'' was the ultimate Lightning version to see British service. Originally it was nearly identical to the F.3A with the exception that it could carry two {{convert|260|impgal|L|adj=on}} [[ferry tank]]s on [[Hardpoint|pylons]] over the wings. These tanks were jettisonable in an emergency, and gave the F.6 a substantially improved deployment capability. There remained one glaring shortcoming: the lack of cannon. This was finally rectified in the form of a modified ventral tank with two ADEN cannons mounted in the front. The addition of the cannons and their ammunition decreased the tank's fuel capacity from {{convert|610|to|535|impgal|L}}, but the cannon made the F.6 a \"real fighter\" again.<ref name= \"Pilot's Notes, F.6\" />\n\nThe final British Lightning was the ''Lightning F.2A''. This was an F.2 upgraded with the cambered wing, the squared fin, and the {{convert|610|impgal|L}} ventral tank. The F.2A retained the A.I.23 and Firestreak missile, the nose cannon, and the earlier Avon 211R engines.<ref name= \"Aircrew Manual, F.2A\">''Lightning F.Mk.2A Aircrew Manual''. Warton Aerodrome, UK: English Electric Technical Services, July 1968.</ref> Although the F.2A lacked the thrust of the later Lightnings, it had the longest tactical range of all Lightning variants, and was used for low-altitude interception over [[West Germany]].\n\n===Export and further developments===\nThe ''Lightning F.53'', otherwise known as the ''Export Lightning'', developed as a private venture by BAC. While the Lightning had originated as an interception aircraft, this version was to have a [[Multirole combat aircraft|multirole]] capability for quickly interchanging between interception, reconnaissance, and ground-attack duties.<ref name=\"flight68 p371\">''Flight International'' 5 September 1968, p. 371.</ref> The F.53 was based on the F.6 airframe and avionics, including the large ventral fuel tank, cambered wing and overwing pylons for drop tanks of the F.6, but incorporated an additional pair of hardpoints under the outer wing. These hardpoints could be fitted with pylons for [[air-to-ground weaponry]], including two {{convert|1000|lb|abbr=on}} bombs or four [[SNEB]] rocket pods each carrying 18 68&nbsp;mm rockets. A gun pack carrying two ADEN cannons and 120 rounds each could replace the forward part of the ventral fuel tank.<ref name=\"flight68 p372-3\">''Flight International'' 5 September 1968, pp. 372\u2013373.</ref>{{refn|The ventral cannon installation was designed for the export aircraft but was later adopted by the RAF for the F.6 and F.2A.<ref name=\"WoF7 p57\">Lake 1997, p. 57.</ref>|group=nb}} Alternative, interchangeable packs in the forward fuselage carried two Firestreak missiles, two Red Top missiles, twin retractable launchers for 44\u00d7 {{convert|2|inch|adj=on|sigfig=1}} rockets, or a [[reconnaissance pod]] fitted with five 70&nbsp;mm Type 360 Vinten cameras.<ref name=\"flight68 p373\">''Flight International'' 5 September 1968, p. 373.</ref>\n\nBAC also proposed clearing the overwing hardpoints for carriage of weapons as well as [[drop tank]]s, with additional Matra JL-100 combined rocket and fuel pods (each containing 18 SNEB {{convert|68|mm|abbr=on|lk=on}} rockets and {{convert|227|L|impgal|lk=on|order=flip}} of fuel) or {{convert|1000|lb}} bombs being possible options. This could give a maximum ground attack weapons load for a developed export Lightning of six {{convert|1000|lb}} bombs or 44 \u00d7 {{convert|2|in|adj=on|abbr=on}} rockets and 144 \u00d7 68&nbsp;mm rockets.<ref name=\"combatp67\">Gunston and Spick 1983, p. 67.</ref><ref name=\"flight68 p372-3,6\">''Flight International'' 5 September 1968, pp. 372\u2013373, 376.</ref> The ''Lightning T.55'' was the export two-seat variant; unlike the RAF two-seaters, the T.55 was equipped for combat duties. The T.55 had a very similar fuselage to the T.5, while also using the wing and large ventral tank of the F.6.<ref name=\"WoF7 p56-7\" /> The Export Lightning had all of the capability of the RAF's own Lightnings such as exceptional climb rate and agile manoeuvering. The Export Lightning also retained the difficulty of maintenance, and serviceability rates suffered. The F.53 was generally well regarded by its pilots, and its adaptation to multiple roles showed the skill of its designers.<ref name= \"McLelland 2009\">McLelland 2009, {{page needed|date=April 2012}}</ref>\n\nIn 1963, BAC Warton was working on the preliminary design of a two-seat Lightning development with a [[variable-geometry wing]], based on the Lightning T.5. In addition to the [[variable-sweep wing]], which was to sweepback between 25 degrees and 60 degrees, the proposed design featured an extended ventral pack for greater fuel capacity, an enlarged dorsal fin fairing, an arrestor hook, and a revised inward-retracting undercarriage. The aircraft was designed to be compatible with the [[Royal Navy]]'s existing [[aircraft carriers]] [[carrier-based aircraft]], the VG Lightning concept was revised into a land-based interceptor intended for the RAF the following year.<ref name= \"Wood 1986\">Wood 1986, pp. 183\u2013184.</ref> Various alternative engines to the Avon were suggested, such as the newer [[Rolls-Royce Spey]] engine. It is likely that the VG Lightning would have adopted a solid nose (by moving the air inlet to the sides or to upper fuselage) to install a larger, more capable radar.<ref name =\"buttler 114-117\" />\n\n==Design==\n\n===Overview===\nThe Lightning had several distinctive design features, the primary being the twin-engine arrangement, notched [[delta wing]], and low-mounted tailplane. The vertically stacked and longitudinally staggered engines were the solution devised by Petter to meet the conflicting requirements of minimising frontal area, providing undisturbed engine airflow across a wide speed range, and packaging two engines to provide sufficient thrust to meet performance goals. The unusual over/under configuration allowed for the thrust of two engines, with the [[Aerodynamic drag|drag]] equivalent to only 1.5 engines mounted side-by-side, a reduction in drag of 25% over more conventional twin-engine installations.<ref>{{citation |url=http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1968/1968%20-%201766.html |title=Multi-mission Lightning |work=Flight International |page=372 |date=5 September 1960}}</ref> The engines were fed by a single nose inlet (with [[inlet cone]]), with the flow split vertically aft of the cockpit, and the nozzles tightly stacked, effectively tucking one engine behind the cockpit. The result was a low frontal area, an efficient inlet, and excellent single-engine handling with no problems of asymmetrical thrust. Because the engines were close together, an uncontained failure of one engine was likely to damage the other. If desired, an engine could be shut down in flight and the remaining engine run at a more efficient power setting which increased range or endurance;<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1957/1957%20-%200542.html|title=air marshal \u2013 wg \u2013 ib \u2013 1957 \u2013 0542 \u2013 Flight Archive}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1968/1968%20-%201770.html|title=1968 \u2013 1770 \u2013 Flight Archive}}</ref> although this was rarely done operationally because there would be no hydraulic power if the remaining engine failed .<ref name=\"flightglobal.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1961/1961%20-%200231.html|title=lightning \u2013 english electric \u2013 1961 \u2013 0231 \u2013 Flight Archive}}</ref>\n\n[[File:EE Lightning F6 XS904 BQ (7173122840).jpg|thumb|left|Lightning F.6 XS904 after a high-speed taxi run at 2012 Cold War Jets Day, Bruntingthorpe]]\n\nProduction aircraft were powered by various models of the [[Rolls-Royce Avon]] engine. This power-plant was initially rated as capable of generating {{convert|11250|lbf|kN|abbr=on}} of dry thrust, but when employing the four-stage [[afterburner]] this increased to a maximum thrust of {{convert|14430|lbf|kN|abbr=on}}.

The inlet's central shock cone served as a compression surface, diverting air into the annular inlet. As the Lightning accelerated through Mach 1, the shock cone generated an oblique shock positioned forward of the intake lip. Known as a subcritical inlet condition, this was stable, but produced inefficient spillage drag. Around the Design Mach speed, the oblique shock was positioned just forward of the inlet lip and efficiently compressed the air without spillage. When travelling beyond the Design Mach, the oblique shock became supercritical, and supersonic airflow entered the inlet duct, which could only handle subsonic air. In this condition, the engine generated drastically less thrust and may result in [[engine surge|surge]]s or [[compressor stall]]s, these could cause [[flameout]]s or damage.\n\nThermal and structural limits were also present. Air is heated considerably when compressed by the passage of an aircraft at supersonic speeds. The airframe absorbs heat from the surrounding air, the inlet shock cone at the front of the aircraft becoming the hottest part. The shock cone was composed of fibreglass, necessary because the shock cone also served as a radar radome; a metal shock cone would have interfered with the AI 23's radar emissions. The shock cone was eventually weakened due to the fatigue caused by the thermal cycles involved in regularly performing high-speed flights. At {{convert|36000|ft}} and {{convert|1.7|Mach|36000|km/h|0}}, the heating conditions on the shock cone was similar to those at sea level and {{convert|650|kn|km/h}} indicated airspeed,<ref group=\"nb\">On a standard day, the temperature of the air at the tip of the shock cone (stagnation temperature) was {{convert|156|\u00b0F}} at {{convert|1.7|Mach|36000|km/h|0}} and {{convert|36000|ft}}.

The shock cone was strengthened on the later Lightning F.2A, F.3, F.6, and F.53 models, thus allowing routine operations at up to Mach 2.0.<ref name= \"McLelland 2009_50\">McLelland 2009, p. 50.</ref>\n\nThe small-fin variants could exceed Mach 1.7,{{refn|Roland Beamont took the Lightning P.1B XA847, a prototype of the F.1, to Mach 2.0. Prior testing had determined that the aircraft had the excess thrust to achieve this speed, given the right atmospheric conditions of a high tropopause and lower-than-standard temperature. The test flight was to check for inlet stability and monitor temperatures at higher Mach. The aircraft was equipped with a temperature probe to monitor the stagnation temperature, up to a never-exceed temperature of 115&nbsp;\u00b0C. On 28 November 1958, the weather availed a high tropopause and a substandard \u221267&nbsp;\u00b0C at {{convert|40000|ft}}.

It remains the only UK-designed-and-built fighter capable of [[Mach number|Mach 2]].  The Lightning was designed, developed, and manufactured by [[English Electric]], which was later absorbed by the newly-formed [[British Aircraft Corporation]]. Later the type was marketed as the '''BAC Lightning'''.  It was operated by the [[Royal Air Force]] (RAF), the [[Kuwait Air Force]] (KAF) and the [[Royal Saudi Air Force]] (RSAF).\n\nA unique feature of the Lightning's design is the vertical, staggered configuration of its two [[Rolls-Royce Avon]] [[turbojet]] engines within the fuselage. The Lightning was initially designed and developed as an interceptor to defend the [[V bomber]] airfields<ref>Note: at the time, the V bombers carried Britain's [[nuclear deterrent]] and thus were the likely first-strike targets of a Soviet air attack on the UK. In addition to the Lightning, last line-of-defence for the airfields was to be what became the [[Bloodhound (missile)|Bristol Bloodhound]] guided missile.</ref> from attack by anticipated future nuclear-armed supersonic Soviet bombers such as what emerged as the [[Tupolev Tu-22]], but it was subsequently also required to intercept other [[bomber]] aircraft such as the [[Tupolev Tu-16]] and the [[Tupolev Tu-95]]. The Lightning has exceptional [[rate of climb]], [[Ceiling (aeronautics)|ceiling]], and speed; pilots have described flying it as \"being saddled to a skyrocket\".<ref name= \"Winchester p. 82\" /> This performance and the initially limited fuel supply<ref>Note: the original specification only called for a 150-mile radius of action from the V bomber bases the aircraft was defending. [[Roland Beamont]] later called for the Lightning's fuel capacity to be greatly increased, which it was.</ref> made the Lightning a \"fuel-critical\" aircraft, meaning that its missions are dictated to a high degree by its limited range. Later developments provided greater range and speed along with [[aerial reconnaissance]] and [[Close air support|ground-attack]] capability.\n\nFollowing retirement by the RAF in the late 1980s, many of the remaining aircraft became museum exhibits. Until 2009, three Lightnings were kept flying at \"[[Thunder City]]\" in [[Cape Town]], South Africa. In September 2008, the [[Institution of Mechanical Engineers]] conferred on the Lightning its \"Engineering Heritage Award\" at a ceremony at [[BAE Systems]]' site at [[Warton Aerodrome]].<ref>Robinson, Ben.

Petter|W.E.W. \"Teddy\" Petter]], formerly chief designer at [[Westland Aircraft]], was a keen early proponent of Britain's need to develop a supersonic fighter aircraft. In 1947, Petter approached the [[Ministry of Supply (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Supply]] (MoS) with his proposal, and in response [[List of Air Ministry Specifications|Specification ER.103]] was issued for a single research aircraft, which was to be capable of flight at {{convert|1.5|Mach|50,000|km/h|0}} and {{convert|50000|ft}}.<ref>Darling 2000, pp. 6\u20137.</ref>\n\nPetter initiated a design proposal with [[Frederick Page|F W \"Freddie\" Page]] leading the design and [[Ray Creasey]] responsible for the aerodynamics.{{sfnp|Davies|2014|p=104}} By July 1948 their proposal incorporated the stacked engine configuration and a high-mounted tailplane but was designed for Mach 1.5. As a consequence it had a conventional 40\u00b0 swept wing {{sfnp|Davies|2014|p=102}} This proposal was submitted in the November {{sfnp|Ransom|1986|p=218}} and in January 1949 the project was designated P.1 by English Electric.{{sfnp|Ransom|1986|p=58}} On 29 March 1949 MoS granted approval for English Electric to start the detailed design, develop wind tunnel models and build a full-size mockup. The design that had developed during 1948 evolved further during 1949.{{sfnp|Ransom|1986|p=219}}{{sfnp|Davies|2014|p=104}} To achieve Mach 2 the wing sweep was increased to 60\u00b0 with the ailerons moved to the wingtips.{{sfnp|Davies|2014|p=103}} In late 1949 low-speed wind tunnel tests showed that a vortex was generated by the wing which caused a large downwash on the tailplane; this issue was solved by lowering its height below the wing.{{sfnp|Davies|2014|p=103}} Following the resignation of Petter, Page took over as design team leader for the P.1.<ref name=\"Darling 2000, pp. 8\u201310\">Darling 2000, pp. 8\u201310.</ref>\n\nIn 1949, the Ministry of Supply had issued Specification F23/49, which expanded upon the scope of ER103 to include fighter-level manoeuvring. On 1 April 1950, English Electric received a contract for two flying [[airframe]]s, as well as one static airframe, designated ''P.1.''<ref name=\"Darling 2000, pp. 8\u201310\" />\n\nThe [[Royal Aircraft Establishment]] was sceptical of Petter's swept wing concepts. To test the design of both the wing, the tailplane and to assess handling, [[Short Brothers]] were issued a contract to produce the [[Short SB5]] in mid-1950.<ref group=\"nb\">The SB5 was allocated serial number WG768 on 27 July 1950.</ref><ref>{{cite magazine|magazine=Air-Britain Aeromilitaria|volume=37|issue=145|title=Post-1950 Aircraft Specifications|author=Phil Butler|publisher=[[Air-Britain]]|pages=24\u201325|issn=0262-8791 }}</ref> This was a low-speed research aircraft and was designed so that different wing sweep angles could be assumed by the single aircraft. An assortment of tailplanes and wings were supplied and could be installed in order for their flight performance to be evaluated. However, following the first flight of the SB.5 on 2 December 1952, the trials demonstrated the choice of a tailplane and a 60-degree wingsweep and proved the design principles to be effective.<ref>Darling 2000, pp. 7\u20138.</ref>\n\n===Prototypes===\n[[File:English Electric P.1 (27898298121).jpg|thumb|P1A]]\nFrom 1953 onwards, the first three prototype aircraft were hand-built at [[Samlesbury]]. These aircraft had been assigned the [[United Kingdom military aircraft serial numbers|aircraft serials]] ''WG760'', ''WG763'', and ''WG765'' (the static airframe){{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}. The prototypes were powered by un-[[Afterburner|reheated]] [[Armstrong Siddeley Sapphire]] turbojets, as the selected [[Rolls-Royce Avon]] engines which powered subsequent production aircraft had fallen behind schedule due to their own development problems.<ref>Darling 2000, p. 10.</ref> Due to the limited internal space of the fuselage the fuel capacity was relatively small, giving the prototypes an extremely limited [[combat endurance|endurance]], and the narrow tyres housed in the thin wings rapidly wore out.<ref name=\"Scott 2000_13\">Scott 2000, p. 13.</ref> Outwardly, the prototypes looked very much like the production series, but they were distinguished by the rounded-triangular intakes, short fins and lack of operational equipment.<ref name= \"Winchester p. 82\" />\n\nOn 9 June 1952, it was decided that there would be a second phase of prototypes built to develop the aircraft towards achieving {{convert|2.0|Mach|km/h|0}}; these were designated ''P.1B'' while the initial three prototypes were retroactively reclassified as ''P.1A''.<ref>Darling 2000, pp. 16\u201317.</ref> P.1B was a significant improvement on P.1A. While it was similar in aerodynamics, structure and control systems, it incorporated extensive alterations to the forward fuselage, reheated Rolls Royce Avon R24R engines, a conical centre body [[inlet cone]], variable nozzle reheat and provision for weapons systems integrated with the [[air data computer|ADC]] and [[Airborne interception radar#AI.23|AI.23 radar]].{{sfnp|Beamont|1984|p=51-52}}<ref name =\"buttler 65\" /> Three P1B prototypes were built, assigned serials XA847, XA853 and XA856<ref name=\"Beamont 123\">Beamont 1985 p.123</ref>\n\nIn May 1954, ''WG760'' and its support equipment were moved to [[RAF Boscombe Down]] for pre-flight ground taxi trials; on the morning of 4 August 1954, ''WG760'', piloted by [[Roland Beamont]], flew for the first time from Boscombe Down.<ref>Darling 2000, pp. 10\u201312.</ref> One week later, ''WG760'' officially achieved [[supersonic]] flight for the first time, having exceeded the [[speed of sound]] during its third flight.<ref name =\"buttler 65\">Buttler 2000, p. 65.</ref> During its first flight, ''WG760'' had unknowingly exceeded {{convert|1|Mach|km/h|0}}, but due to [[position error]] the [[Machmeter|Mach meter]] only showed a maximum of {{convert|0.95|Mach|km/h|0}}. The occurrence was noticed during flight data analysis a few days later.<ref>[http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1957/1957%20-%200541.html \"Progress with the P.1\"] ''Flight'', 26 April 1957, p.&nbsp;543.</ref> While ''WG760'' had proven the P.1 design to be viable, it was limited to {{convert|1.51|Mach|km/h|0}} due to [[directional stability]] limits. In May 1956, the P.1 received the \"Lightning\" name, which was said to have been partially selected to reflect the aircraft's supersonic capabilities.<ref name =\"buttler 66\">Buttler 2000, p. 66.</ref>\n\nOn 4 April 1957 Beamont made the first flight of the P.1B (XA847) exceeding Mach 1 during this flight.{{sfnp|Flight|26 April 1957}}{{sfnp|Beamont|1985|p=56-57}} On 25 November he reached Mach 2, {{sfnp|Beamont|1985|p=67}} the first time in a British aircraft.<ref name= \"Winchester p. 82\" /> During the early flight trials of the P.1B speeds in excess of 1,000&nbsp;mph were achieved daily. During this period the [[Fairey FD2]] delta held the world speed record (1,132&nbsp;mph achieved on 10 March 1956 and held till December 1957). While the P.1B was potentially faster than the FD2, it lacked the fuel capacity to provide one run in each direction at maximum speed to claim the record in accordance with international rules.{{sfnp|Beamont|1985|p=59}}\n\nIn 1958 two test pilots from the USAF [[Air Force Flight Test Center]], Andy Anderson and [[Deke Slayton]], were given the opportunity to familiarise themselves with the P1B. Slayton, who was subsequently selected as one of the [[Project Mercury|Mercury]] astronauts, commented:\n\n{{quote|The P.1 was a terrific plane, with the easy handling of the F-86 and the performance of an F-104. Its only drawback was that it had no range at all. . . Looking back, however, I'd have to say that the P.1 was my favourite all-time plane.<ref>{{cite publication |title=Deke!

To best perform this intercept mission, emphasis was placed on rate-of-climb, acceleration, and speed, rather than [[range (aeronautics)|range]] \u2013 originally a radius of operation of {{convert|150|mi}} from the V bomber airfields was specified \u2013 and [[combat endurance]]. It was equipped with two 30&nbsp;mm ADEN cannon in front of the cockpit windscreen and an interchangeable fuselage weapons pack containing either an additional two ADEN cannon, 48 {{convert|2|in|adj=on|spell=in}} unguided air-to-air rockets, or two [[de Havilland Firestreak]] [[air-to-air missile]]s;<ref name=\"Scott 2000_119\">Scott 2000, pp. 119\u2013129.</ref> a heavy loadout optimised for damaging large aircraft. The [[Ferranti]] [[AI.23]] onboard radar provided [[missile guidance]] and ranging, as well as search and track functions.<ref name= \"Pilot's Notes, F.1\" />\n\nThe next two Lightning variants, the ''Lightning F.1A'' and ''F.2'', were steady but relatively minor refinements of the design; the next variant, the ''Lightning F.3'', was a major departure. The F.3 had higher thrust [[Rolls-Royce Avon]] 301R engines, a larger squared-off fin and strengthened [[inlet cone]] allowing a service clearance to {{convert|2.0|Mach|km/h|0}} (the F.1, F.1A and F.2 were limited to {{convert|1.7|Mach|km/h|0}}).<ref name= \"Pilot's Notes, F.3\">''Pilot's Notes, Lightning F.Mk.3''. Warton Aerodrome, UK: English Electric Technical Services, April 1965.</ref> The A.I.23B radar and [[Red Top missile]] offered a forward hemisphere attack capability and deletion of the nose cannon. The new engines and fin made the F.3 the highest performance Lightning yet, but with an even higher fuel consumption and resulting shorter range. The next variant, the ''Lightning F.6'', was already in development, but there was a need for an interim solution to partially address the F.3's shortcomings, the ''F.3A''.\n\n[[File:English Electric Lightning F3, UK - Air Force AN1127832.jpg|thumb|left|Lightning F.3 in flight, 1983]]\nThe F.3A introduced two improvements: a new, non-jettisonable, {{convert|610|impgal|L|adj=on}} ventral fuel tank,<ref name= \"Pilot's Notes, F.6\">''Pilot's Notes, Lightning F.Mk.6''. Warton Aerodrome, UK: English Electric Technical Services, September 1966.</ref> and a new, kinked, conically cambered wing leading edge, incorporating a slightly larger [[leading edge]] fuel tank, raising the total usable internal fuel by {{convert|716|impgal|L}}. The conically cambered wing improved manoeuvrability, especially at higher altitudes, and the ventral tank nearly doubled available fuel. The increased fuel was welcome, but the lack of cannon armament was felt to be a deficiency. It was thought that cannons were desirable to fire warning shots in the intercept mission.<ref>Williams and Gustin 2004, p. 106.</ref>\n\nThe ''Lightning F.6'' was the ultimate Lightning version to see British service. Originally it was nearly identical to the F.3A with the exception that it could carry two {{convert|260|impgal|L|adj=on}} [[ferry tank]]s on [[Hardpoint|pylons]] over the wings. These tanks were jettisonable in an emergency, and gave the F.6 a substantially improved deployment capability. There remained one glaring shortcoming: the lack of cannon. This was finally rectified in the form of a modified ventral tank with two ADEN cannons mounted in the front. The addition of the cannons and their ammunition decreased the tank's fuel capacity from {{convert|610|to|535|impgal|L}}, but the cannon made the F.6 a \"real fighter\" again.<ref name= \"Pilot's Notes, F.6\" />\n\nThe final British Lightning was the ''Lightning F.2A''. This was an F.2 upgraded with the cambered wing, the squared fin, and the {{convert|610|impgal|L}} ventral tank. The F.2A retained the A.I.23 and Firestreak missile, the nose cannon, and the earlier Avon 211R engines.<ref name= \"Aircrew Manual, F.2A\">''Lightning F.Mk.2A Aircrew Manual''. Warton Aerodrome, UK: English Electric Technical Services, July 1968.</ref> Although the F.2A lacked the thrust of the later Lightnings, it had the longest tactical range of all Lightning variants, and was used for low-altitude interception over [[West Germany]].\n\n===Export and further developments===\nThe ''Lightning F.53'', otherwise known as the ''Export Lightning'', developed as a private venture by BAC. While the Lightning had originated as an interception aircraft, this version was to have a [[Multirole combat aircraft|multirole]] capability for quickly interchanging between interception, reconnaissance, and ground-attack duties.<ref name=\"flight68 p371\">''Flight International'' 5 September 1968, p. 371.</ref> The F.53 was based on the F.6 airframe and avionics, including the large ventral fuel tank, cambered wing and overwing pylons for drop tanks of the F.6, but incorporated an additional pair of hardpoints under the outer wing. These hardpoints could be fitted with pylons for [[air-to-ground weaponry]], including two {{convert|1000|lb|abbr=on}} bombs or four [[SNEB]] rocket pods each carrying 18 68&nbsp;mm rockets. A gun pack carrying two ADEN cannons and 120 rounds each could replace the forward part of the ventral fuel tank.<ref name=\"flight68 p372-3\">''Flight International'' 5 September 1968, pp. 372\u2013373.</ref>{{refn|The ventral cannon installation was designed for the export aircraft but was later adopted by the RAF for the F.6 and F.2A.<ref name=\"WoF7 p57\">Lake 1997, p. 57.</ref>|group=nb}} Alternative, interchangeable packs in the forward fuselage carried two Firestreak missiles, two Red Top missiles, twin retractable launchers for 44\u00d7 {{convert|2|inch|adj=on|sigfig=1}} rockets, or a [[reconnaissance pod]] fitted with five 70&nbsp;mm Type 360 Vinten cameras.<ref name=\"flight68 p373\">''Flight International'' 5 September 1968, p. 373.</ref>\n\nBAC also proposed clearing the overwing hardpoints for carriage of weapons as well as [[drop tank]]s, with additional Matra JL-100 combined rocket and fuel pods (each containing 18 SNEB {{convert|68|mm|abbr=on|lk=on}} rockets and {{convert|227|L|impgal|lk=on|order=flip}} of fuel) or {{convert|1000|lb}} bombs being possible options. This could give a maximum ground attack weapons load for a developed export Lightning of six {{convert|1000|lb}} bombs or 44 \u00d7 {{convert|2|in|adj=on|abbr=on}} rockets and 144 \u00d7 68&nbsp;mm rockets.<ref name=\"combatp67\">Gunston and Spick 1983, p. 67.</ref><ref name=\"flight68 p372-3,6\">''Flight International'' 5 September 1968, pp. 372\u2013373, 376.</ref> The ''Lightning T.55'' was the export two-seat variant; unlike the RAF two-seaters, the T.55 was equipped for combat duties. The T.55 had a very similar fuselage to the T.5, while also using the wing and large ventral tank of the F.6.<ref name=\"WoF7 p56-7\" /> The Export Lightning had all of the capability of the RAF's own Lightnings such as exceptional climb rate and agile manoeuvering. The Export Lightning also retained the difficulty of maintenance, and serviceability rates suffered. The F.53 was generally well regarded by its pilots, and its adaptation to multiple roles showed the skill of its designers.<ref name= \"McLelland 2009\">McLelland 2009, {{page needed|date=April 2012}}</ref>\n\nIn 1963, BAC Warton was working on the preliminary design of a two-seat Lightning development with a [[variable-geometry wing]], based on the Lightning T.5. In addition to the [[variable-sweep wing]], which was to sweepback between 25 degrees and 60 degrees, the proposed design featured an extended ventral pack for greater fuel capacity, an enlarged dorsal fin fairing, an arrestor hook, and a revised inward-retracting undercarriage. The aircraft was designed to be compatible with the [[Royal Navy]]'s existing [[aircraft carriers]] [[carrier-based aircraft]], the VG Lightning concept was revised into a land-based interceptor intended for the RAF the following year.<ref name= \"Wood 1986\">Wood 1986, pp. 183\u2013184.</ref> Various alternative engines to the Avon were suggested, such as the newer [[Rolls-Royce Spey]] engine. It is likely that the VG Lightning would have adopted a solid nose (by moving the air inlet to the sides or to upper fuselage) to install a larger, more capable radar.<ref name =\"buttler 114-117\" />\n\n==Design==\n\n===Overview===\nThe Lightning had several distinctive design features, the primary being the twin-engine arrangement, notched [[delta wing]], and low-mounted tailplane. The vertically stacked and longitudinally staggered engines were the solution devised by Petter to meet the conflicting requirements of minimising frontal area, providing undisturbed engine airflow across a wide speed range, and packaging two engines to provide sufficient thrust to meet performance goals. The unusual over/under configuration allowed for the thrust of two engines, with the [[Aerodynamic drag|drag]] equivalent to only 1.5 engines mounted side-by-side, a reduction in drag of 25% over more conventional twin-engine installations.<ref>{{citation |url=http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1968/1968%20-%201766.html |title=Multi-mission Lightning |work=Flight International |page=372 |date=5 September 1960}}</ref> The engines were fed by a single nose inlet (with [[inlet cone]]), with the flow split vertically aft of the cockpit, and the nozzles tightly stacked, effectively tucking one engine behind the cockpit. The result was a low frontal area, an efficient inlet, and excellent single-engine handling with no problems of asymmetrical thrust. Because the engines were close together, an uncontained failure of one engine was likely to damage the other. If desired, an engine could be shut down in flight and the remaining engine run at a more efficient power setting which increased range or endurance;<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1957/1957%20-%200542.html|title=air marshal \u2013 wg \u2013 ib \u2013 1957 \u2013 0542 \u2013 Flight Archive}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1968/1968%20-%201770.html|title=1968 \u2013 1770 \u2013 Flight Archive}}</ref> although this was rarely done operationally because there would be no hydraulic power if the remaining engine failed .<ref name=\"flightglobal.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1961/1961%20-%200231.html|title=lightning \u2013 english electric \u2013 1961 \u2013 0231 \u2013 Flight Archive}}</ref>\n\n[[File:EE Lightning F6 XS904 BQ (7173122840).jpg|thumb|left|Lightning F.6 XS904 after a high-speed taxi run at 2012 Cold War Jets Day, Bruntingthorpe]]\n\nProduction aircraft were powered by various models of the [[Rolls-Royce Avon]] engine. This power-plant was initially rated as capable of generating {{convert|11250|lbf|kN|abbr=on}} of dry thrust, but when employing the four-stage [[afterburner]] this increased to a maximum thrust of {{convert|14430|lbf|kN|abbr=on}}.

Immediately after takeoff, the nose would be lowered for rapid acceleration to {{convert|430|kn|km/h}} [[Indicated airspeed|IAS]] before initiating a climb, stabilising at {{convert|450|kn|km/h}}.

The inlet's central shock cone served as a compression surface, diverting air into the annular inlet. As the Lightning accelerated through Mach 1, the shock cone generated an oblique shock positioned forward of the intake lip. Known as a subcritical inlet condition, this was stable, but produced inefficient spillage drag. Around the Design Mach speed, the oblique shock was positioned just forward of the inlet lip and efficiently compressed the air without spillage. When travelling beyond the Design Mach, the oblique shock became supercritical, and supersonic airflow entered the inlet duct, which could only handle subsonic air. In this condition, the engine generated drastically less thrust and may result in [[engine surge|surge]]s or [[compressor stall]]s, these could cause [[flameout]]s or damage.\n\nThermal and structural limits were also present. Air is heated considerably when compressed by the passage of an aircraft at supersonic speeds. The airframe absorbs heat from the surrounding air, the inlet shock cone at the front of the aircraft becoming the hottest part. The shock cone was composed of fibreglass, necessary because the shock cone also served as a radar radome; a metal shock cone would have interfered with the AI 23's radar emissions. The shock cone was eventually weakened due to the fatigue caused by the thermal cycles involved in regularly performing high-speed flights. At {{convert|36000|ft}} and {{convert|1.7|Mach|36000|km/h|0}}, the heating conditions on the shock cone was similar to those at sea level and {{convert|650|kn|km/h}} indicated airspeed,<ref group=\"nb\">On a standard day, the temperature of the air at the tip of the shock cone (stagnation temperature) was {{convert|156|\u00b0F}} at {{convert|1.7|Mach|36000|km/h|0}} and {{convert|36000|ft}}.

Prior testing had determined that the aircraft had the excess thrust to achieve this speed, given the right atmospheric conditions of a high tropopause and lower-than-standard temperature. The test flight was to check for inlet stability and monitor temperatures at higher Mach. The aircraft was equipped with a temperature probe to monitor the stagnation temperature, up to a never-exceed temperature of 115&nbsp;\u00b0C. On 28 November 1958, the weather availed a high tropopause and a substandard \u221267&nbsp;\u00b0C at {{convert|40000|ft}}.

The [[Treaty of Rome]], establishing the [[European Economic Community]] in 1957, already expressed the necessity to instaure free movement of capital in between the member states. Then, the directive of 1988 implemented it by preventing any restriction on free capital flow.<ref>B\u00e2ch\u00e9 Jean-Pierre. La lib\u00e9ration des mouvements de capitaux : bilan et \u00e9ch\u00e9ances. In: Revue d'\u00e9conomie financi\u00e8re, n\u00b08-9, 1989. L\u2019Europe mon\u00e9taire : SME, \u00c9cu, Union mon\u00e9taire. pp. 104-111.</ref> In 1999 was created the [[Financial Services Action Plan|financial services action plan]], first step in creating a single market for capital, and in 2011 the [[European Supervisory Authority]], in order to insure the European financial markets stability. Only four years later, is the CMU project presented by Jean-Claude Juncker.\n\n=== Characteristics of the EU financial system ===\nEU economy remains bank-oriented, especially when compared to the [[United States]].<ref name=\":8\">\u00ab Chapitre 1. Priorit\u00e9s pour l\u2019ach\u00e8vement du march\u00e9 unique \u00bb, \u00c9tudes \u00e9conomiques de l\u2019OCDE, vol. 12, no. 12, 2016, pp. 51-81.</ref> It means that corporations usually prefer to borrow money to the banking sector instead of financing their investments through [[Financial market|financial markets]]. According to the [[OECD]] analysis, this is partly due to the fiscal bias : in most European countries, firms benefit from tax advantages if their have to reimburse a bank loan, but that is not the case if they emitted obligations on the capital markets.<ref name=\":9\">\u00ab \u00c9valuation et recommandations \u00bb, \u00c9tudes \u00e9conomiques de l\u2019OCDE, vol. 12, no. 12, 2016, pp. 13-45.</ref> Therefore, there is a strong financial incentive for European companies to favour the banking sector. This high reliance on the banking system implies less stability for the European economy, hence the position of the European Commission, which advocates for a diversification of financing sources. <ref name=\":5\" /><ref name=\":10\">C\u0153ur\u00e9, B.

Whereas the [[United States]] population choose to invest in long-maturity-assets through [[Pension fund|pension funds]] or life insurances, European savers prefer easily accessible financial instruments, such as [[Deposit account|deposits]] or short-maturity-assets.<ref name=\":4\" /> This economic behaviour generates a lack of financial profitability of the EU and accentuate the importance of banks as the main funding providers of the [[Economy of Europe|European economy]].<ref name=\":10\" />\n\nThe third characteristic of the European financial system is that capital invested stay usually in the national market : it is the home bias.<ref>European Banking Authority, Benchmarking of Remuneration Practices at Union Level (London, June 2014).</ref> Even if before 2011, there was a positive trend for cross-border investments, most of the capital flow was remaining within the national frontiers of the [[Member state|member states]]<ref name=\":10\" /> and European financial integration is still limited.<ref name=\":4\" /> This lack of cross-border investments prevent high-growth-potential companies from getting the financial ressources they need to develop innovations and become more competitive.<ref>Thomas Philippon and Nicolas V eron, Financing Europe\u2019s Fast Movers (Bruegel Policy Brief 2008/01, January 2008).</ref> In fact, [[Shareholder|shareholders]] prefer buying shares from their national companies, creating an important hinder to European financial integration, because they have to face regulation barriers if they want to invest in another country of the EU.<ref name=\":11\" />\n\n=== Financial and political shocks ===\n==== Impact of the 2011 crisis ====\nThe [[Financial crisis of 2007\u201308|financial crisis]] had two main consequences on the financial integration of the European Union. Firstly, it showed the instability induced by an excessive reliance on banks' loans. When there is [[uncertainty]], the offer of [[credit]] is reduced, impacting negatively all the economic activities depending on it.<ref name=\":5\" /> It is especially the case for Europe, whose SMEs mainly get financed by the banking system.<ref name=\":10\" /> Dealing with the aftermaths of the 2011 crisis, the dependency of the EU economy on banks made it harder to growth and [[Employment rate|employment]], according to the former President of the European Commission.<ref>Jean-Claude Juncker, A New Start for Europe: My Agenda for Jobs, Growth, Fairness and Democratic Change, opening statement in the European Parliament session (European Commission, Strasbourg, 15 July 2014)</ref> Secondly, the financial crisis increased the fragmentation of the European capital markets by increasing the domestic bias.<ref name=\":12\">De Boissieu, Christian. \u00ab L\u2019Union des march\u00e9s de capitaux : une mise en perspective \u00bb, Annales des Mines - R\u00e9alit\u00e9s industrielles, vol. ao\u00fbt 2018, no. 3, 2018, pp. 84-87.</ref>[[File:2016-02 City of London.jpg|thumb|Financial centre of the [[City of London]]. |269x269px]] There was a sensible reduction of cross-border investments after 2011.<ref name=\":4\" /> because the previous financial integration was led by banks investing on international financial markets. Once affected by the crisis, their withdrawal drove the European financial system to more fragmentation than before.<ref name=\":10\" />\n\n==== Impact of the Brexit ====\nMost of the financial power of the European Union is located in the [[The City: London and the Global Power of Finance|City, in London]].<ref name=\":4\" /> However, following the [[Brexit referendum|referendum of the 23rd of June 2016]], the United Kingdom initiated the procedure to get out of the European Union.<ref name=\":5\" /> Even if some British firms are moving the continental Europe, [[Brexit]] means the loss of most of the financial expertise of the EU.<ref name=\":12\" /> In spite of that, the European Commission asserted the consistency of the Capital Markets Union action plan, already launched at the time, and accelerated the efforts to implement it.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\n== Objectives ==\n=== Economic goals===\n[[File:Illustration objectives.png|alt=|thumb|808x808px|Three levels of objectives of the CMU, as defined by the European Commission, which lead to the seven areas of intervention of the Capital Markets Union action plan. This graph was drawn according to the CMU 2017 [https://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/info/files/staff-working-document-cmu-mid-term-review-june2017_en.pdf mid-term review]]]\nThe European Commission designed 3 different levels of objectives for the Capital Markets Union, from the global economic goals to the more concrete necessity for the construction of an [[Financial integration|integrated financial system]]. These economic objectives frame the six intervention areas encompassed by the action plan.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\n====Overarching objectives====\n\n* '''Facilitating the financing of both private and public sector on the financial markets'''\n\nThe Capital Markets Union aims to ease the access of firms and states to financing, which has become more difficult since the financial crisis of 2010-2011. The creation of a single market for capital would send an incentive to [[Private investment fund|private]] and institutional actors to invest the capital available, by creating new possibilities of cross-border attractive investments.<ref name=\":10\" /> This renewed possibility of financing may help the economic agents to come back to the level of growth they had before the crisis, impacting positively the employment rate.<ref name=\":3\" /> It is especially true for SMEs <ref name=\":9\" />which might need more financing than what the banking system can offer them and therefore, would benefit from more accessible capital markets. CMU would also make the institutional investments in infrastructures way easier.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\n* '''Ensuring the stability and the sustainability of the European financial system through integration'''\n\n[[Economic stability]] depends on the diversification of the source of financing. When encountering a [[crisis]] hitting a particular source of financing, such as the banks in 2010, it is important to be able to get capital otherwise, both for the [[State (polity)|states]] and the [[Company|companies]].<ref name=\":8\" />  That is why giving and incentive to get financing through capital markets with the CMU would make the economy more shock-resistant, because it would depend less on the banking system.<ref name=\":5\" /> <ref name=\":12\" /> On the investors side, stability is ensured by the [[Portfolio (finance)|portfolio]] and the geographical diversification of the [[Asset|assets]]. It reduces the loss of value if a specific economic area is hit by a negative shock when you have invested in several types of activities and it reduces the loss if a specific country is touched when you have invested in several countries. Hence, the risk-sharing influence of the CMU may strengthen the European economic stability.<ref>Bent E Sorensen and Oved Yosha, \u2018International Risk Sharing and European Monetary Unification\u2019 (1998) 45 Journal of International Economics 211\u201338</ref> <ref name=\":3\" /> Regarding [[sustainability]], the increased access to capital is considered as a mean to finance environment-friendly economic projects and to encourage [[sustainable development]].<ref name=\":5\" />\n\n====Strategic objectives====\n\n* '''Improving the competitiveness and the efficiency of the European capital markets, in order to fight against the \"market fatigue\"'''\n\nBy increasing the range of investments opportunities, a CMU objective is to improve the capital markets effectiveness. This means improving the allocation of capital<ref name=\":4\" />, leading it to the most efficient economic actors among the European firms, because a single market for capital would have given the possibility to do so. The efficiency of capital markets deals with the competition between the European [[financial institution]] : making them gather in a common capital market would give the financial institution the incentive to become even more efficient.<ref name=\":10\" /> Competition would also lead to more diversification in terms of [[liability (financial accounting)|liabilities]] and assets.<ref name=\":3\" /> Market fatigue is the discredit from which asset and [[Security (finance)|security]] exchanges suffered after the financial crisis. It reduces the capital flow on the capital markets and has a negative impact on the economic activity.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.economist.com/special-report/2009/10/03/market-fatigue|title=Market fatigue|work=The Economist|access-date=2020-03-23|issn=0013-0613}}</ref>\n\n* '''Pursuing a stable financial integration, in order to fight against the \"integration fatigue\"'''\n\nThe improved integration of the capital markets with the CMU is meant to increase cross-border risk-sharing and to reduce the home-biais of the investments. Currently, there are still some hindrances, as the differences in terms of regulation among the member-states, which persuade the economic actors to invest in their home-country. Actually, the multiplication of European rules regarding [[insolvency]], restructuration or [[Tax|taxation]] represents a lack of legal security for the investors. <ref name=\":5\" /> As the main point of a single market for capital is to remove the barriers of free capital flow in-between the member-states <ref name=\":3\" />, the objective is to attract the savings of the richer countries towards the poorer ones. Removing the barriers preventing European exchanges, in order to act like a unified territory, is the very sens of integration. It counters the \"integration fatigue\" : the increasing difficulty for the European leaders to pursue the European integration.<ref>Devrim, Deniz, and Evelina Schulz. \"Enlargement fatigue in the European Union: from enlargement to many unions.\" Elcano Newsletter 54 (2009): 26.</ref> It is an incentive to invest abroad, therefore reducing the home-biais. Moreover, investing in another country leads to a geographical diversification of the assets possessed, which has a positive impact on the economic stability, as explained previously.<ref name=\":12\" />\n\n* '''Increasing cohesion within the European Union, in order to fight against the \"eroding consensus\"'''\n\nThe \"eroding consensus\" is the increasing difficulty to get the support of the [[European population]] for the European institutions' decisions. The erosion is illustrated by the negative response of France and Netherlands to the European [[Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe|referendum on the constitution of the EU]].<ref>Meyer, Christoph O. \"Asymmetric and asynchronous mediatisation: How public sphere research helps to understand the erosion of the EU\u2019s consensus culture.\" workshop \u2018A European Public Sphere: How much of it do we have and how much do we need. 2005.</ref> The Capital Markets Union's goal is to represent a part of the solution to this issue, by improving the cohesion in Europe. Firstly, it is a project encompassing different [[Currencies of the European Union|currencies]], therefore encompassing countries outside the Eurozone area. Secondly, it involves few changes in the way European institutions work, preventing any opposition to a total overhaul. Finally, it does not require risk-sharing from the member-states, which could have made the population reluctant to the CMU.<ref name=\":3\" /> Its main contribution to the European cohesion is its goal : to equally provide financing on capital markets, across the [[Geography of the European Union|European territory]], and to provide this access on the basis of the economic actors' merit.<ref name=\":10\" />\n\n====Operational objectives====\n\n* '''Improving data availability across European countries'''\n\nInvestors on the capital markets don't always have the necessary means to gather the needed information in order to invest, while financing institutions do. However, [[Economics|incertitude]] about there investments may prevent them from investing as much as they could have if they have had the adequate information. The latter would have allowed them to evaluate the worth of an asset and juge if its price corresponds, or not, to its value.<ref name=\":9\" /> Therefore, the first operational objective of the CMU is to increase the information flow to make the price setting on the capital markets more precise.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\n* '''Facilitating the access to markets'''\nAs it might be complicated for a small firm to produce the information necessary to enter the capital markets <ref name=\":5\" />, the CMU's purpose is to set up the required execution infrastructures to ease their access. This means reducing the regulatory obstacles stopping SMEs and start-up to finance themselves through capital markets, so that every economic actor could have an equal access to the capital needed.<ref name=\":3\" /> Concretely, it leads to a simplification of the rules regarding the information production for small [[Issuer|issuers]].<ref name=\":9\" />\n\n* '''Strengthening the implementation of the regulation protecting the investors'''\n\nBecause of the lack of confidence in the [[Financial regulation|regulatory]] structures protecting the investors, the amount of capital invested might be reduced. Consequently, the third operational objective of the CMU is to give more strength to the contracts and the rules protecting the capital providers so that they regain confidence on the capital markets.<ref name=\":3\" /> The idea of the project is that legal certainty that they are no going to loose suddenly the wealth they have invested will encourage the use of capital markets as a good mean to yield a profit from the savings rather than keeping it on a [[bank account]].<ref name=\":5\" />\n\n=== Actors targeted <ref name=\":3\" />===\nThe Capital Market Union action plan aims at affecting positively 4 types of economic actors :\n\n* '''Citizens : improving the profitability on savings for retirement and the opportunities of investments'''\nIf citizens had the possibility to access capital markets in an easy way, they could use their savings to invest instead of keeping them on their bank account. They would do so because of the wider range of possible investments.<ref name=\":5\" /> It may be more profitable for them and increase the money they have for their retirement.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\n* '''Companies : extending the possibilities to be financed differently than by a bank loan'''\nFirms, and especially SMEs which still face difficulties entering capital markets, would get access to European capital in an easier way on a single capital market where the information regulation would have been adapted to their situation. This is particularly true for the start-ups experiencing high growth and in need of a quicker financing to sustain their development.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\n* '''Investors : reducing the hindrance to invest in another member state'''\nAs explained previously, the harmonisation of the regulation across the European Union would allow investors to enter other member-state's capital market more easily.

This stagnation might be due to multiple factors, such as the return of growth in the Eurozone countries, reducing the economic incentive to reform its financial system, the rise of political tensions within the EU or the prioritisation of national issues by the European political leaders.<ref name=\":12\" /> Moreover, as the effects of such structural reforms can hardly been observed in the short term, it is difficult to analyse the results of the Capital Markets Union action plan without a bigger time perspective than we have today.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\n== Criticism ==\n'''Benefits to the Economy'''\n\nThere is the assumption that developing Capital Markets is important for the economy as it brings along growth and prosperity with diversified sources of investment capital boosting the [[real economy]] in general. The [[Bank for International Settlements]]  outlines that financial markets development accumulates debt and does not improve the real economy and growth as it benefits from high-collateral and low-productivity projects generating misallocation of resources.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Cecchetti|first=Stephen|last2=Kharroubi|first2=Enisse|date=2014|title=Why Does Credit Growth Crowd Out Real Economic Growth?|url=https://www.bis.org/publ/work490.pdf|journal=|location=Cambridge, MA|volume=|pages=|via=}}</ref>\n\nIn addition, the growth in debt activities by capital markets before the [[Financial crisis of 2007\u201308|2008 economic crisis]] did not lead to growth in the real economy instead, the increased interaction between banks and market-based activities augmented the probability of [[systemic risk]].<ref>Yongoua Tchikanda, G.

In sum, it creates [[Shadow banking system|shadow banking]].<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n'''Financing via Capital Markets'''\n\nThe banking sector is recognised to be one of the most important forms of financing for European companies. Nevertheless, the introduction of the [[Basel III]] restricted banking lending and put Capital Markets as an alternative for European business to raise funds.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Langfield|first=Sam|last2=Pagano|first2=Marco|date=2016|title=Bank bias in Europe: effects on systemic risk and growth|journal=Economic Policy|volume=31|issue=85|pages=51\u2013106|doi=10.1093/epolic/eiv019|issn=0266-4658}}</ref> Captal Markets were seen as an alternative to banks. However different member states have different levels of financial development some of them, most notably the southern ones, are more likely to be penalised with the project.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite book|last=Dinov|first=Stanyo|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/338581120|title=European Capital Markets Union - claims and criticisms|date=2020-01-14|isbn=978-3-643-13883-5}}</ref> The commission had to convince such countryes that the project would be benefitial, nevertheless, the support in the region was somehow limited.<ref name=\":7\" />\n\n'''SMEs'''\n\nIn the field of [[Small and medium-sized enterprises|SMEs]], the CMU aims at giving access to [[Venture capital|Venture Capital]] and lowering costs for funding, however it can lead to shorter holding periods of investment and to great volatility.<ref name=\":14\">{{Cite journal|last=Gurdgiev|first=Constantin|date=2015|title=Summary of Comments on the European Commission Green Paper 'Building a Capital Markets Union'|journal=|location=Rochester, NY|volume=|pages=|doi=10.2139/ssrn.2592918|ssrn=2592918}}</ref> It turns out that SMEs are less stable and represent, in general, risky investments, pushing away banks and limiting SMEs clients. All-in-all this limits the scope of the CMU project through the process of de-risking larger banks and relegating SMEs which in turn concentrates the risk in les agile financial actors.<ref name=\":14\" />\n\nIn addition, SMEs are not always able to cope with the different standards deriving from European and International law such as for instance, the [[International Financial Reporting Standards]] (IFRS), generating extra costs for SMEs and undermining their credibility vis-\u00e0-vis possible investors that look for transparency and guarantees of good management. In practical terms, banks have access to a huge data base where creditworthiness is assessed and then processed. This does not happen on an equal foot for SMEs.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.on-federalism.eu/index.php/articles/283-the-role-of-the-capital-markets-union-towards-regulatory-harmonisation-and-supervisory-convergence|title=The role of the Capital Markets Union: towards regulatory harmonisation and supervisory convergence|website=www.on-federalism.eu|access-date=2020-03-11}}</ref>\n\n'''Securitisation'''\n\nThe securitisation process under the CMU project has been highly criticised because of its previous consequences during the 2008 Financial crisis. It is linked to the fact that securitisation-type transactions have led to interconnectedness with the shadow banking system and high levels of risk taking.<ref name=\":0\" /> The [https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/en/TXT/?uri=celex:32017R2402 Simple, Transparent and Standardised regulation] which should make it easier for investors to assess risk, still lacks  clarity and clear definitions as it paves the way for private entities to interpret it in a broader way undermining its scope.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Schwarcz|first=Steven L.|date=2001|title=Private Ordering of Public Markets: The Rating Agency Paradox|journal=SSRN Working Paper Series|doi=10.2139/ssrn.267273|issn=1556-5068}}</ref>\n\n'''European Integration'''\n\nThe idea that Capital Markets integration is an important project to tackle the problem of [[market fragmentation]] in Europe has its contradictions.

The then British-appointed Commission, [[Jonathan Hill, Baron Hill of Oareford|Johnathan Hill]] was an active voice in promoting the continuation of the initiative.

The [[Treaty of Rome]], establishing the [[European Economic Community]] in 1957, already expressed the necessity to instaure free movement of capital in between the member states. Then, the directive of 1988 implemented it by preventing any restriction on free capital flow.<ref>B\u00e2ch\u00e9 Jean-Pierre. La lib\u00e9ration des mouvements de capitaux : bilan et \u00e9ch\u00e9ances. In: Revue d'\u00e9conomie financi\u00e8re, n\u00b08-9, 1989.

Only four years later, is the CMU project presented by Jean-Claude Juncker.\n\n=== Characteristics of the EU financial system ===\nEU economy remains bank-oriented, especially when compared to the [[United States]].<ref name=\":8\">\u00ab Chapitre 1.

According to the [[OECD]] analysis, this is partly due to the fiscal bias : in most European countries, firms benefit from tax advantages if their have to reimburse a bank loan, but that is not the case if they emitted obligations on the capital markets.<ref name=\":9\">\u00ab \u00c9valuation et recommandations \u00bb, \u00c9tudes \u00e9conomiques de l\u2019OCDE, vol. 12, no. 12, 2016, pp. 13-45.</ref> Therefore, there is a strong financial incentive for European companies to favour the banking sector. This high reliance on the banking system implies less stability for the European economy, hence the position of the European Commission, which advocates for a diversification of financing sources. <ref name=\":5\" /><ref name=\":10\">C\u0153ur\u00e9, B.

Whereas the [[United States]] population choose to invest in long-maturity-assets through [[Pension fund|pension funds]] or life insurances, European savers prefer easily accessible financial instruments, such as [[Deposit account|deposits]] or short-maturity-assets.<ref name=\":4\" /> This economic behaviour generates a lack of financial profitability of the EU and accentuate the importance of banks as the main funding providers of the [[Economy of Europe|European economy]].<ref name=\":10\" />\n\nThe third characteristic of the European financial system is that capital invested stay usually in the national market : it is the home bias.<ref>European Banking Authority, Benchmarking of Remuneration Practices at Union Level (London, June 2014).</ref> Even if before 2011, there was a positive trend for cross-border investments, most of the capital flow was remaining within the national frontiers of the [[Member state|member states]]<ref name=\":10\" /> and European financial integration is still limited.<ref name=\":4\" /> This lack of cross-border investments prevent high-growth-potential companies from getting the financial ressources they need to develop innovations and become more competitive.<ref>Thomas Philippon and Nicolas V eron, Financing Europe\u2019s Fast Movers (Bruegel Policy Brief 2008/01, January 2008).</ref> In fact, [[Shareholder|shareholders]] prefer buying shares from their national companies, creating an important hinder to European financial integration, because they have to face regulation barriers if they want to invest in another country of the EU.<ref name=\":11\" />\n\n=== Financial and political shocks ===\n==== Impact of the 2011 crisis ====\nThe [[Financial crisis of 2007\u201308|financial crisis]] had two main consequences on the financial integration of the European Union. Firstly, it showed the instability induced by an excessive reliance on banks' loans. When there is [[uncertainty]], the offer of [[credit]] is reduced, impacting negatively all the economic activities depending on it.<ref name=\":5\" /> It is especially the case for Europe, whose SMEs mainly get financed by the banking system.<ref name=\":10\" /> Dealing with the aftermaths of the 2011 crisis, the dependency of the EU economy on banks made it harder to growth and [[Employment rate|employment]], according to the former President of the European Commission.<ref>Jean-Claude Juncker, A New Start for Europe: My Agenda for Jobs, Growth, Fairness and Democratic Change, opening statement in the European Parliament session (European Commission, Strasbourg, 15 July 2014)</ref> Secondly, the financial crisis increased the fragmentation of the European capital markets by increasing the domestic bias.<ref name=\":12\">De Boissieu, Christian. \u00ab L\u2019Union des march\u00e9s de capitaux : une mise en perspective \u00bb, Annales des Mines - R\u00e9alit\u00e9s industrielles, vol. ao\u00fbt 2018, no. 3, 2018, pp. 84-87.</ref>[[File:2016-02 City of London.jpg|thumb|Financial centre of the [[City of London]]. |269x269px]] There was a sensible reduction of cross-border investments after 2011.<ref name=\":4\" /> because the previous financial integration was led by banks investing on international financial markets. Once affected by the crisis, their withdrawal drove the European financial system to more fragmentation than before.<ref name=\":10\" />\n\n==== Impact of the Brexit ====\nMost of the financial power of the European Union is located in the [[The City: London and the Global Power of Finance|City, in London]].<ref name=\":4\" /> However, following the [[Brexit referendum|referendum of the 23rd of June 2016]], the United Kingdom initiated the procedure to get out of the European Union.<ref name=\":5\" /> Even if some British firms are moving the continental Europe, [[Brexit]] means the loss of most of the financial expertise of the EU.<ref name=\":12\" /> In spite of that, the European Commission asserted the consistency of the Capital Markets Union action plan, already launched at the time, and accelerated the efforts to implement it.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\n== Objectives ==\n=== Economic goals===\n[[File:Illustration objectives.png|alt=|thumb|808x808px|Three levels of objectives of the CMU, as defined by the European Commission, which lead to the seven areas of intervention of the Capital Markets Union action plan. This graph was drawn according to the CMU 2017 [https://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/info/files/staff-working-document-cmu-mid-term-review-june2017_en.pdf mid-term review]]]\nThe European Commission designed 3 different levels of objectives for the Capital Markets Union, from the global economic goals to the more concrete necessity for the construction of an [[Financial integration|integrated financial system]]. These economic objectives frame the six intervention areas encompassed by the action plan.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\n====Overarching objectives====\n\n* '''Facilitating the financing of both private and public sector on the financial markets'''\n\nThe Capital Markets Union aims to ease the access of firms and states to financing, which has become more difficult since the financial crisis of 2010-2011. The creation of a single market for capital would send an incentive to [[Private investment fund|private]] and institutional actors to invest the capital available, by creating new possibilities of cross-border attractive investments.<ref name=\":10\" /> This renewed possibility of financing may help the economic agents to come back to the level of growth they had before the crisis, impacting positively the employment rate.<ref name=\":3\" /> It is especially true for SMEs <ref name=\":9\" />which might need more financing than what the banking system can offer them and therefore, would benefit from more accessible capital markets. CMU would also make the institutional investments in infrastructures way easier.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\n* '''Ensuring the stability and the sustainability of the European financial system through integration'''\n\n[[Economic stability]] depends on the diversification of the source of financing. When encountering a [[crisis]] hitting a particular source of financing, such as the banks in 2010, it is important to be able to get capital otherwise, both for the [[State (polity)|states]] and the [[Company|companies]].<ref name=\":8\" />  That is why giving and incentive to get financing through capital markets with the CMU would make the economy more shock-resistant, because it would depend less on the banking system.<ref name=\":5\" /> <ref name=\":12\" /> On the investors side, stability is ensured by the [[Portfolio (finance)|portfolio]] and the geographical diversification of the [[Asset|assets]]. It reduces the loss of value if a specific economic area is hit by a negative shock when you have invested in several types of activities and it reduces the loss if a specific country is touched when you have invested in several countries. Hence, the risk-sharing influence of the CMU may strengthen the European economic stability.<ref>Bent E Sorensen and Oved Yosha, \u2018International Risk Sharing and European Monetary Unification\u2019 (1998) 45 Journal of International Economics 211\u201338</ref> <ref name=\":3\" /> Regarding [[sustainability]], the increased access to capital is considered as a mean to finance environment-friendly economic projects and to encourage [[sustainable development]].<ref name=\":5\" />\n\n====Strategic objectives====\n\n* '''Improving the competitiveness and the efficiency of the European capital markets, in order to fight against the \"market fatigue\"'''\n\nBy increasing the range of investments opportunities, a CMU objective is to improve the capital markets effectiveness. This means improving the allocation of capital<ref name=\":4\" />, leading it to the most efficient economic actors among the European firms, because a single market for capital would have given the possibility to do so. The efficiency of capital markets deals with the competition between the European [[financial institution]] : making them gather in a common capital market would give the financial institution the incentive to become even more efficient.<ref name=\":10\" /> Competition would also lead to more diversification in terms of [[liabilities]] and assets.<ref name=\":3\" /> Market fatigue is the discredit from which asset and [[Security (finance)|security]] exchanges suffered after the financial crisis. It reduces the capital flow on the capital markets and has a negative impact on the economic activity.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.economist.com/special-report/2009/10/03/market-fatigue|title=Market fatigue|work=The Economist|access-date=2020-03-23|issn=0013-0613}}</ref>\n\n* '''Pursuing a stable financial integration, in order to fight against the \"integration fatigue\"'''\n\nThe improved integration of the capital markets with the CMU is meant to increase cross-border risk-sharing and to reduce the home-biais of the investments. Currently, there are still some hindrances, as the differences in terms of regulation among the member-states, which persuade the economic actors to invest in their home-country. Actually, the multiplication of European rules regarding [[insolvency]], restructuration or [[Tax|taxation]] represents a lack of legal security for the investors. <ref name=\":5\" /> As the main point of a single market for capital is to remove the barriers of free capital flow in-between the member-states <ref name=\":3\" />, the objective is to attract the savings of the richer countries towards the poorer ones. Removing the barriers preventing European exchanges, in order to act like a unified territory, is the very sens of integration. It counters the \"integration fatigue\" : the increasing difficulty for the European leaders to pursue the European integration.<ref>Devrim, Deniz, and Evelina Schulz. \"Enlargement fatigue in the European Union: from enlargement to many unions.\" Elcano Newsletter 54 (2009): 26.</ref> It is an incentive to invest abroad, therefore reducing the home-biais. Moreover, investing in another country leads to a geographical diversification of the assets possessed, which has a positive impact on the economic stability, as explained previously.<ref name=\":12\" />\n\n* '''Increasing cohesion within the European Union, in order to fight against the \"eroding consensus\"'''\n\nThe \"eroding consensus\" is the increasing difficulty to get the support of the [[European population]] for the European institutions' decisions. The erosion is illustrated by the negative response of France and Netherlands to the European [[Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe|referendum on the constitution of the EU]].<ref>Meyer, Christoph O. \"Asymmetric and asynchronous mediatisation: How public sphere research helps to understand the erosion of the EU\u2019s consensus culture.\" workshop \u2018A European Public Sphere: How much of it do we have and how much do we need. 2005.</ref> The Capital Markets Union's goal is to represent a part of the solution to this issue, by improving the cohesion in Europe. Firstly, it is a project encompassing different [[Currencies of the European Union|currencies]], therefore encompassing countries outside the Eurozone area. Secondly, it involves few changes in the way European institutions work, preventing any opposition to a total overhaul. Finally, it does not require risk-sharing from the member-states, which could have made the population reluctant to the CMU.<ref name=\":3\" /> Its main contribution to the European cohesion is its goal : to equally provide financing on capital markets, across the [[Geography of the European Union|European territory]], and to provide this access on the basis of the economic actors' merit.<ref name=\":10\" />\n\n====Operational objectives====\n\n* '''Improving data availability across European countries'''\n\nInvestors on the capital markets don't always have the necessary means to gather the needed information in order to invest, while financing institutions do. However, [[Economics|incertitude]] about there investments may prevent them from investing as much as they could have if they have had the adequate information. The latter would have allowed them to evaluate the worth of an asset and juge if its price corresponds, or not, to its value.<ref name=\":9\" /> Therefore, the first operational objective of the CMU is to increase the information flow to make the price setting on the capital markets more precise.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\n* '''Facilitating the access to markets'''\nAs it might be complicated for a small firm to produce the information necessary to enter the capital markets <ref name=\":5\" />, the CMU's purpose is to set up the required execution infrastructures to ease their access. This means reducing the regulatory obstacles stopping SMEs and start-up to finance themselves through capital markets, so that every economic actor could have an equal access to the capital needed.<ref name=\":3\" /> Concretely, it leads to a simplification of the rules regarding the information production for small [[Issuer|issuers]].<ref name=\":9\" />\n\n* '''Strengthening the implementation of the regulation protecting the investors'''\n\nBecause of the lack of confidence in the [[Financial regulation|regulatory]] structures protecting the investors, the amount of capital invested might be reduced. Consequently, the third operational objective of the CMU is to give more strength to the contracts and the rules protecting the capital providers so that they regain confidence on the capital markets.<ref name=\":3\" /> The idea of the project is that legal certainty that they are no going to loose suddenly the wealth they have invested will encourage the use of capital markets as a good mean to yield a profit from the savings rather than keeping it on a [[bank account]].<ref name=\":5\" />\n\n=== Actors targeted <ref name=\":3\" />===\nThe Capital Market Union action plan aims at affecting positively 4 types of economic actors :\n\n* '''Citizens : improving the profitability on savings for retirement and the opportunities of investments'''\nIf citizens had the possibility to access capital markets in an easy way, they could use their savings to invest instead of keeping them on their bank account. They would do so because of the wider range of possible investments.<ref name=\":5\" /> It may be more profitable for them and increase the money they have for their retirement.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\n* '''Companies : extending the possibilities to be financed differently than by a bank loan'''\nFirms, and especially SMEs which still face difficulties entering capital markets, would get access to European capital in an easier way on a single capital market where the information regulation would have been adapted to their situation. This is particularly true for the start-ups experiencing high growth and in need of a quicker financing to sustain their development.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\n* '''Investors : reducing the hindrance to invest in another member state'''\nAs explained previously, the harmonisation of the regulation across the European Union would allow investors to enter other member-state's capital market more easily. In fact, it would reduce their cost of adaptation to the national regulation : the financial regulation of a country would be the one of every member-state. If investing in your home capital market is as simple as investing in another, it would increase the investments opportunities for the investors.<ref name=\":8\" />\n\n* '''Banks : extending the lending opportunities and encourage sane balance-sheets'''\n\nBecause risky investments opportunities would go towards capital markets, a bigger portion of the banks' balance-sheets would be dedicated to [[Real economy|the real economy.]]<ref name=\":5\" /> This is a way for the European Commission to prevent the 2010-2011 financial crisis, when the banks's balance-sheets were composed of too many subprime assets, from happening again.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Tooze, J.

This stagnation might be due to multiple factors, such as the return of growth in the Eurozone countries, reducing the economic incentive to reform its financial system, the rise of political tensions within the EU or the prioritisation of national issues by the European political leaders.<ref name=\":12\" /> Moreover, as the effects of such structural reforms can hardly been observed in the short term, it is difficult to analyse the results of the Capital Markets Union action plan without a bigger time perspective than we have today.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\n== Criticism ==\n'''Benefits to the Economy'''\n\nThere is the assumption that developing Capital Markets is important for the economy as it brings along growth and prosperity with diversified sources of investment capital boosting the [[real economy]] in general. The [[Bank for International Settlements]]  outlines that financial markets development accumulates debt and does not improve the real economy and growth as it benefits from high-collateral and low-productivity projects generating misallocation of resources.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Cecchetti|first=Stephen|last2=Kharroubi|first2=Enisse|date=2014|title=Why Does Credit Growth Crowd Out Real Economic Growth?|url=https://www.bis.org/publ/work490.pdf|journal=|location=Cambridge, MA|volume=|pages=|via=}}</ref>\n\nIn addition, the growth in debt activities by capital markets before the [[Financial crisis of 2007\u201308|2008 economic crisis]] did not lead to growth in the real economy instead, the increased interaction between banks and market-based activities augmented the probability of [[systemic risk]].<ref>Yongoua Tchikanda, G. (2017) ''\u02bbSystemic risk and individual risk: A trade-off?\u02bc'' Working Paper, 20. \u02c2https://economix.fr/pdf/dt/2017/WP_EcoX_2017-16.pdf<nowiki />\u02c3</ref> One of the main causes of the 2008 financial crisis, as it has become known, was due to the excessive development of capital markets financing.<ref name=\":0\">Bavoso, V.

''Accounting Economics and Law: a Convivium'' , 1-57. <nowiki>https://doi.org/10.1515/ael-2017-0039</nowiki></ref>\n\nFurthermore, as outlined, Capital Markets often represent higher costs for SMEs fundraising and the development of debt Capital Markets increases the risk of [[systemic risk]] through the connection of balance sheets via securitisation with poor risk transmission. In sum, it creates [[Shadow banking system|shadow banking]].<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n'''Financing via Capital Markets'''\n\nThe banking sector is recognised to be one of the most important forms of financing for European companies. Nevertheless, the introduction of the [[Basel III]] restricted banking lending and put Capital Markets as an alternative for European business to raise funds.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Langfield|first=Sam|last2=Pagano|first2=Marco|date=2016|title=Bank bias in Europe: effects on systemic risk and growth|journal=Economic Policy|volume=31|issue=85|pages=51\u2013106|doi=10.1093/epolic/eiv019|issn=0266-4658}}</ref> Captal Markets were seen as an alternative to banks. However different member states have different levels of financial development some of them, most notably the southern ones, are more likely to be penalised with the project.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite book|last=Dinov|first=Stanyo|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/338581120|title=European Capital Markets Union - claims and criticisms|date=2020-01-14|isbn=978-3-643-13883-5}}</ref> The commission had to convince such countryes that the project would be benefitial, nevertheless, the support in the region was somehow limited.<ref name=\":7\" />\n\n'''SMEs'''\n\nIn the field of [[Small and medium-sized enterprises|SMEs]], the CMU aims at giving access to [[Venture capital|Venture Capital]] and lowering costs for funding, however it can lead to shorter holding periods of investment and to great volatility.<ref name=\":14\">{{Cite journal|last=Gurdgiev|first=Constantin|date=2015|title=Summary of Comments on the European Commission Green Paper 'Building a Capital Markets Union'|journal=|location=Rochester, NY|volume=|pages=|doi=10.2139/ssrn.2592918|ssrn=2592918}}</ref> It turns out that SMEs are less stable and represent, in general, risky investments, pushing away banks and limiting SMEs clients. All-in-all this limits the scope of the CMU project through the process of de-risking larger banks and relegating SMEs which in turn concentrates the risk in les agile financial actors.<ref name=\":14\" />\n\nIn addition, SMEs are not always able to cope with the different standards deriving from European and International law such as for instance, the [[International Financial Reporting Standards]] (IFRS), generating extra costs for SMEs and undermining their credibility vis-\u00e0-vis possible investors that look for transparency and guarantees of good management. In practical terms, banks have access to a huge data base where creditworthiness is assessed and then processed. This does not happen on an equal foot for SMEs.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.on-federalism.eu/index.php/articles/283-the-role-of-the-capital-markets-union-towards-regulatory-harmonisation-and-supervisory-convergence|title=The role of the Capital Markets Union: towards regulatory harmonisation and supervisory convergence|website=www.on-federalism.eu|access-date=2020-03-11}}</ref>\n\n'''Securitisation'''\n\nThe securitisation process under the CMU project has been highly criticised because of its previous consequences during the 2008 Financial crisis. It is linked to the fact that securitisation-type transactions have led to interconnectedness with the shadow banking system and high levels of risk taking.<ref name=\":0\" /> The [https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/en/TXT/?uri=celex:32017R2402 Simple, Transparent and Standardised regulation] which should make it easier for investors to assess risk, still lacks  clarity and clear definitions as it paves the way for private entities to interpret it in a broader way undermining its scope.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Schwarcz|first=Steven L.|date=2001|title=Private Ordering of Public Markets: The Rating Agency Paradox|journal=SSRN Working Paper Series|doi=10.2139/ssrn.267273|issn=1556-5068}}</ref>\n\n'''European Integration'''\n\nThe idea that Capital Markets integration is an important project to tackle the problem of [[market fragmentation]] in Europe has its contradictions. Unlike the [[Banking union|Banking Union]], the Capital Markets Union project encompasses different member states with different legal backgrounds and does not entail full harmonisation.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nAccording to the ECB, to tackle the problem of market fragmentation, capital markets need equal access to financial services and equal treatment and not just convergence as it will not guarantee financial integration.<ref>{{Cite journal|url=https://op.europa.eu:443/en/publication-detail/-/publication/f913783c-3fef-4b2f-9db2-4e10cc637856/language-en|title=Building a capital markets union : Eurosystem contribution to the European Commission's Green Paper.|last=Union|first=Publications Office of the European|date=2015-06-24|website=op.europa.eu|doi=10.2866/815982|access-date=2020-03-11}}</ref> Nonetheless, the project has not managed to deliver this so far and with the UK's exit, it seems unlike that efforts will be made in this field as other financial centres will compete to takes London's place in the continent.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Lavery|first=Scott|last2=McDaniel|first2=Sean|last3=Schmid|first3=Davide|date=2019-10-03|title=Finance fragmented?

The then British-appointed Commission, [[Jonathan Hill, Baron Hill of Oareford|Johnathan Hill]] was an active voice in promoting the continuation of the initiative. The Brexit decision was shocking for many as it meant that the CMU would see its efforts to build a risk-sharing via liquidity [[Derivatives market|derivatives]] and [[Capital market|securities markets]] very limited.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Busch|first=Danny|date=2017-09-01|title=A Capital Markets Union for a Divided Europe|url=https://academic.oup.com/jfr/article/3/2/262/3897098|journal=Journal of Financial Regulation|volume=3|issue=2|pages=262\u2013279|doi=10.1093/jfr/fjx002|issn=2053-4833}}</ref>\n\nThe initial aim of the project was to get closer to UK by repairing the ties with the EU27 as it would include all member states attracting and benefiting [[City of London|the City]] at the same time.<ref>Djankov, S, (2016). \u02bbLong-Term Impacts on Brexit\u02bc  PIIE \u02c2https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1z0MyjPP5m8<nowiki />\u02c3</ref> In practice, it will also mean that the EU will lose the UK's wholesale market rendering the project somehow \"meaningless\" as this incentive along with the UK's proactive role diminished the project's publicization as from Brexit and lost support from some [[Member state of the European Union|member states.]]<ref name=\":1\" />\n== See also ==\n* [[List of European stock exchanges|List of European Stock Exchanges]]\n* [[List of currencies in Europe|List of Currencies in Europe]]\n* [[Banking union|Banking Union]]\n* [[Economic and Monetary Union of the European Union|Economic and Monetary Union]]\n* [[European Central Bank]]\n* [[European Investment Bank]]\n* [[European Banking Authority]]\n* [[European Securities and Markets Authority]]\n* [[European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority]]\n\n== Notes ==\n\n{{Reflist|group=nb}}<br />\n== References ==\n<references />\n\n{{Euro topics}}\n{{European Union topics}}\n{{Portal bar|European Union|Economics}}\n\n[[Category:Finance]]\n[[Category:European Union]]\n[[Category:Eurozone]]\n[[Category:Economy of the European Union]]\n[[Category:Eurogroup]]\n[[Category:Euro]]\n", "name_user": "Cnwilliams", "label": "safe", "comment": "Disambiguated:liabilities\u2192liability (financial accounting)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_Markets_Union"}
