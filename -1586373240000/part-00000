In his work he called the quantity basic reproduction rate and denoted it by ''Z''<sub>0</sub>. Calling the quantity a \"rate\" can be misleading, insofar as it can be interpreted as number per unit of time. The expressions number or ratio are now preferred.\n\n== Definitions in specific cases ==\n=== Reproductive number as it relates to contact rate and infectious period ===\n[[File:R Naught Ebola and Flu Diagram.svg|thumb|''R''<sub>0</sub> is the average number of people infected from one other person, for example, Ebola has an ''R''<sub>0</sub> of two, so on average, a person who has Ebola will pass it on to two other people.]]\n\nSuppose that infectious individuals make an average of <math>\\beta</math> infection-producing contacts per unit time, with a mean infectious period of <math>\\tau</math>. Then the basic reproduction number is:\n\n:<math> R_0 = \\beta\\,\\tau</math>\n\nThis simple formula suggests different ways of reducing ''R''<sub>0</sub> and ultimately infection propagation. It is possible to decrease the number of infection-producing contacts per unit time <math>\\beta</math> by reducing the number of contacts per unit time (for example staying at home if the infection requires contact with others to propagate) or the proportion of contacts that produces infection (for example wearing some sort of protective equipment). It is also possible to decrease the infectious period <math>\\tau</math> by finding and then isolating, treating or eliminating (as is often the case with animals) infectious individuals as soon as possible.\n\n=== With varying latent periods ===\nLatent period is the transition time between contagion event and disease manifestation.  In cases of diseases with varying latent periods, the basic reproduction number can be calculated as the sum of the reproduction numbers for each transition time into the disease. An example of this is tuberculosis. Blower and coauthors calculated from a simple model of TB the following reproduction number:<ref>{{cite journal |last=Blower |first=S. M. |last2=Mclean |first2=A.

The definition must account for the fact that a typical infected individual may not be an average individual. As an extreme example, consider a population in which a small portion of the individuals mix fully with one another while the remaining individuals are all isolated. A disease may be able to spread in the fully mixed portion even though a randomly selected individual would lead to fewer than one secondary case. This is because the typical infected individual is in the fully mixed portion and thus is able to successfully cause infections. In general, if the individuals infected early in an epidemic are on average either more likely or less likely to transmit the infection than individuals infected late in the epidemic, then the computation of ''R''<sub>0</sub> must account for this difference. An appropriate definition for ''R''<sub>0</sub> in this case is \"the expected number of secondary cases produced by a typical infected individual early in an epidemic\".<ref name=\"Diekmann\">{{cite journal|author=O Diekmann|author2=J.A.P.

In his work he called the quantity basic reproduction rate and denoted it by ''Z''<sub>0</sub>. Calling the quantity a \"rate\" can be misleading, insofar as it can be interpreted as number per unit of time. The expressions number or ratio are now preferred.\n\n== Definitions in specific cases ==\n=== Reproductive number as it relates to contact rate and infectious period ===\n[[File:R Naught Ebola and Flu Diagram.svg|thumb|''R''<sub>0</sub> is the average number of people infected from one other person, for example, Ebola has an ''R''<sub>0</sub> of two, so on average, a person who has Ebola will pass it on to two other people.]]\n\nSuppose that infectious individuals make an average of <math>\\beta</math> infection-producing contacts per unit time, with a mean infectious period of <math>\\tau</math>. Then the basic reproduction number is:\n\n:<math> R_0 = \\beta\\,\\tau</math>\n\nThis simple formula suggests different ways of reducing ''R''<sub>0</sub> and ultimately infection propagation. It is possible to decrease the number of infection-producing contacts per unit time <math>\\beta</math> by reducing the number of contacts per unit time (for example staying at home if the infection requires contact with others to propagate) or the proportion of contacts that produces infection (for example wearing some sort of protective equipment). It is also possible to decrease the infectious period <math>\\tau</math> by finding and then isolating, treating or eliminating (as is often the case with animals) infectious individuals as soon as possible.\n\n=== With varying latent periods ===\nLatent period is the transition time between contagion event and disease manifestation.  In cases of diseases with varying latent periods, the basic reproduction number can be calculated as the sum of the reproduction numbers for each transition time into the disease. An example of this is tuberculosis. Blower and coauthors calculated from a simple model of TB the following reproduction number:<ref>{{cite journal |last=Blower |first=S. M. |last2=Mclean |first2=A.

The definition must account for the fact that a typical infected individual may not be an average individual. As an extreme example, consider a population in which a small portion of the individuals mix fully with one another while the remaining individuals are all isolated. A disease may be able to spread in the fully mixed portion even though a randomly selected individual would lead to fewer than one secondary case. This is because the typical infected individual is in the fully mixed portion and thus is able to successfully cause infections. In general, if the individuals who become infected early in an epidemic may be more (or less) likely to transmit than a randomly chosen individual late in the epidemic, then our computation of ''R''<sub>0</sub> must account for this tendency. An appropriate definition for ''R''<sub>0</sub> in this case is \"the expected number of secondary cases produced by a typical infected individual early in an epidemic\".<ref name=\"Diekmann\">{{cite journal|author=O Diekmann|author2=J.A.P.

The Treaty of Fontainebleau signed on 11 April 1814 marked the immediate abdication of Napoleon and the end of the embargo on British goods known as the Continental Blockade, suddenly making it much more congenial for the British to visit Europe once more, resurrecting the tradition of The Grand Tour. \n\nInterrupting his career in politics, Shaw Stewart, then aged 27, seized the opportunity to embark on his Grand Tour without hesitation. He carefully recorded his adventures in a diary which, initially intended for his parents, provides contemporary readers with an exceptional insight in the state of Europe so soon after the first defeat of Napoleon. Shaw Stewart travelled to Germany and the Low Countries, France and Italy, where he was particularly attracted to the artistic milieu, visiting the studios of the greatest artists of the time, including those of Canova and later Thordvaldsen, to whom he returned in 1828, once he had inherited the Baronetcy from his father in 1825.\n\nIn the early years of the 19th Century Europe's eyes were fixed on Napoleon and his tumultuous rise to power which undoubtedly did not escape Shaw Stewart. So it is not surprising he seized the opportunity afforded by his travels to meet many of Napoleon's family, including his brother J\u00e9r\u00f4me and his mother, Madame M\u00e8re, but never Napoleon himself. In 1814 he was able to purchase the hat worn by the Emperor throughout the 1807 campaign, from the Keeper of the Palace of Dresden. On his second meeting with Madame M\u00e8re, in 1816, she presented him with a full-length portrait of Napoleon by Robert Lef\u00e8vre. Shaw Stewart continued to make additional purchases throughout his life, such as the wine bottle and lock of mane from Napoleon's favourite charger, by tradition Marengo's.
