This method makes it generally impossible to engage in just-so storytelling because the hypothesis and predictions are made ''a priori'', based on the theory. By contrast, the \"bottom-up\" approach, whereby an observation is made and a hypothesis is generated to explain the hypothesis, could potentially be a form of just-so storytelling if no novel predictions were developed from the hypothesis. Provided novel, testable predictions are made from the hypothesis, then it cannot be argued that the hypothesis is a just-so story. Al-Shawaf et al argue that the just-so accusation is a result of the fact that, like other evolutionary sciences, evolutionary psychology is partially a historical discipline. However, the authors argue that if this made evolutionary psychology nothing but just-so storytelling, then other partially historical scientific disciplines such as astrophysics, geology or cosmology would also be just-so storytelling. What makes any scientific discipline, not just partially historical ones, valid is their ability to make testable novel predictions in the present day.

Furthermore, the authors argue that Gould's use of the term \"adaptive function\" is overly restrictive, as they insist it must refer to the original adaptive function the trait evolved for. According to the authors, this is a nonsensical requirement, because if an adaptation was then used for a new, different, adaptive function, then this makes the trait an adaptation because it remains in the population because it helps organisms with this new function. Thus the trait's original purpose is irrelevant because it has been co-opted for an new purpose and maintains itself within the species because it increases reproductive success of members of the species who have it (versus those who may have lost it for some reason); nature is blind to the original \"intended\" function of the trait.<ref>Figueredo, Aurelio Jos\u00e9, and Sarah Christine Berry. \"\u201cJust not so stories\u201d: Exaptations, spandrels, and constraints.\" Behavioral and Brain Sciences 25, no. 4 (2002): 517-518.</ref>\n\nDavid Buss argued that while Gould's \"just-so story\" criticism is that the data that an evolutionary psychology adaptationist hypothesis explains could be equally explained by different hypotheses (such as exaptationist or co-opted spandrel hypotheses), Gould failed to meet the relevant evidentiary burdens with regards to these alternative hypotheses. According to Buss, co-opted exaptationist and spandrel hypotheses have an additional evidentiary burden compared to adaptationist hypotheses, as they must identify both the later co-opted functionality and the original adaptational functionality, while proposals that something is a co-opted byproduct must identify what the trait was a byproduct of and what caused it to be co-opted; it is not sufficient simply to propose an alternative exaptationist, functionless byproduct or spandrel hypotheses to the adaptationist one, rather these evidentiary burdens must be met. Buss argues that Gould's failure to do this meant that his assertion that apparent adaptations were actually exaptations was itself nothing more than a just-so story.<ref>Buss, David M., Martie G.

{"title_page": "Posthumous birth", "text_new": "{{distinguish|Coffin birth}}\n{{Refimprove|date=July 2008}}\nA '''posthumous birth''' is the birth of a child after the death of a biological parent.<ref>{{cite web |title=Posthumous Child Law and Legal Definition |publisher=USLegal |url=https://definitions.uslegal.com/p/posthumous-child/}}</ref> A person born in these circumstances is called a '''posthumous child''' or a '''posthumously born person'''. Most inst Life is ultimately meaningless ances of posthumous birth involve the birth of a child after the death of its father, but the term is also applied to infants delivered after the death of the mother, usually by [[caesarean section]].<ref name=Quigley>Christine Quigley, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=QbRreZuttqMC&pg=PA181&lpg=PA181 The Corpse: A History]'', McFarland, 1996, {{ISBN|0-7864-0170-2}}, pages 180 to 181.</ref>\n\n==Legal implications==\nPosthumous birth has special implications in [[law]], potentially affecting the child's [[citizenship]] and [[legal rights]], [[inheritance]], and [[order of succession]]. Legal systems generally include special provisions regarding inheritance by posthumous children and the legal status of such children. For example, [[Massachusetts]] law states that a posthumous child is treated as having been living at the death of the parent,<ref name=Sekino/> meaning that the child receives the same share of the parent's estate as if the child had been born before the parent's death. Another emerging legal issue in the United States is the control of genetic material after the death of the donor.<ref>{{cite web |title=Frozen in Time: Planning for the Posthumously Conceived Child |url= http://www.natlawreview.com/article/frozen-time-planning-posthumously-conceived-child|publisher=Fairfield and Woods P.C. |work=The National Law Review|date=9 July 2009|accessdate=7 April 2012}}</ref> [[United States]] law holds that posthumous children of U.S. citizens who are born outside the United States have the same rights to citizenship that they would have had if the deceased U.S. citizen parent had been alive at the time of their birth.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://fam.state.gov/FAM/08FAM/08FAM030404.html |title=U.S. Department of State Foreign Affairs Manual Volume 8, 8 FAM 304.4 Posthumous Children |access-date=18 July 2018}}</ref>  In the field of [[assisted reproduction]], [[snowflake children]], i.e.  those \"adopted\" as frozen embryos by people unrelated to them, can result in the birth of a child after the death of one or both of their genetic parents.\n\n===In monarchies===\nA posthumous birth has special significance in the case of [[hereditary monarchy|hereditary monarchies]] following [[primogeniture]]. In this system, a monarch's own child precedes that monarch's sibling in the order of succession. In cases where the widow of a childless king is pregnant at the time of his death, the next-in-line is not permitted to assume the throne,{{cn|date=September 2014}} but must yield place to the unborn child, or ascends and reigns until the child is born.{{cn|date=September 2014}} In monarchies that follow [[male-preference cognatic primogeniture]], the situation is similar where the dead monarch was not childless but left a daughter as the next-in-line, as well as a pregnant widow. A posthumous brother would supplant that daughter in the succession, whereas a posthumous sister, being younger, would not. Similarly, in monarchies that follow [[agnatic primogeniture]], the sex of the unborn child determines the succession; a posthumous male child would himself succeed, whereas the next-in-line would succeed upon the birth of a posthumous female child.\n\n===Modern complications===\nPosthumous [[Fertilization|conception]] by [[artificial insemination]] or [[in vitro fertilization]], whether done using [[sperm]] or [[ovum|ova]] stored before a parent's death or [[posthumous sperm retrieval|sperm retrieved from a man's corpse]], has created new legal issues.<ref name=Sekino>Renee H. Sekino, [http://www.bu.edu/law/scitech/volume8/Sekino.pdf Posthumous Conception: The Birth of a New Class] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040715174044/http://www.bu.edu/law/scitech/volume8/Sekino.pdf |date=15 July 2004 }}, ''Boston University Journal of Sci. and Tech. Law'', 2001.</ref> When a woman is inseminated with her deceased husband's sperm, laws that establish that a [[sperm donor]] is not the legal father of the child born as a result of artificial insemination have had the effect of excluding the deceased husband from fatherhood and making the child legally fatherless.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.lawlink.nsw.gov.au/lrc.nsf/pages/R49CHP12 |title=Report 49 (1986) \u2014 Artificial Conception: Human Artificial Insemination, 12. AIH and Posthumous Use of Semen |publisher=Law Reform Commission, New South Wales}}</ref> In the [[United Kingdom]] before 2000, birth records of children conceived using a dead man's sperm had to identify the infants as fatherless, but in 2000 the government announced that the law would be changed to allow the deceased father's name to be listed on the [[birth certificate]].<ref name=NSW>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/895544.stm |title=Posthumous fathers to be recognised |work=BBC News |date=25 August 2000}}</ref> In 1986, a [[New South Wales]] legal reform commission recommended that the law should recognize the deceased husband as the father of a child born from post-mortem artificial insemination, provided that the woman is his widow and unmarried at the time of birth, but the child should have inheritance rights to the father's estate only if the father left a [[will (law)|will]] that included specific provisions for the child.<ref name=NSW/> In 2001, the [[Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court]] was asked to consider whether the father's name should appear on the birth record for a child conceived through artificial insemination after her father's death, as well as whether that child was eligible for [[U.S. Social Security]] benefits. The court ruled in January 2002 that a child could be the legal heir of a dead parent if there was a genetic relationship and the deceased parent had both agreed to the posthumous conception and committed to support the child.<ref name=Sekino/> Different U.S. state courts and federal appellate courts have ruled differently in similar cases. In 2012, the [[U.S. Supreme Court]] ruled in ''[[Astrue v. Capato]]'' that twins born 18 months after their father's death using the father's frozen sperm were ''not'' eligible for Social Security benefits, which set a new precedent.\n\n==Naming==\nIn the Middle Ages, it was traditional for posthumous children born in [[England]] to be given a [[matronymic]] surname instead of a patronymic one. This may in part explain why matronyms are more common in England than in other parts of Europe.<ref name=bowman>Bowman, William Dodgson. ''The Story of Surnames''. London, George Routledge & Sons, Ltd., 1932. No ISBN.</ref>\n\nIn [[Ancient Rome]], posthumous children of noble birth were often given the [[cognomen]] (or third name) '[[Postumus]].' One example is [[Agrippa Postumus]]. However, it is likely that the term simply meant \"the last child\" or youngest born, and did not always indicate posthumous birth.\n\n==Notable people born posthumously==\n===Antiquity===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!'''Name'''\n!'''Born'''\n!'''Late parent'''\n!'''Parent died'''\n!'''Gap'''\n!'''Comments'''\n|-\n| [[Alexander IV of Macedon|Alexander IV]]<br>{{small|King of Macedon}} || August 323 BCE || [[Alexander the Great]] || 11 June 323 BCE || {{ntsh|60}}2 months ||\n|-\n| [[Bindusara]]<br>{{small|[[Sasanian Empire|Mauryan]] Emperor}} || 320 BCE || His mother || 320 BCE || || Delivered through [[caesarean section]] after his mother was poisoned.<ref>Lurie S (2005). \"The changing motives of cesarean section: from the ancient world to the twenty-first century\".

Most instances of posthumous birth involve the birth of a child after the death of its father, but the term is also applied to infants delivered after the death of the mother, usually by [[caesarean section]].<ref name=Quigley>Christine Quigley, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=QbRreZuttqMC&pg=PA181&lpg=PA181 The Corpse: A History]'', McFarland, 1996, {{ISBN|0-7864-0170-2}}, pages 180 to 181.</ref>\n\n==Legal implications==\nPosthumous birth has special implications in [[law]], potentially affecting the child's [[citizenship]] and [[legal rights]], [[inheritance]], and [[order of succession]]. Legal systems generally include special provisions regarding inheritance by posthumous children and the legal status of such children. For example, [[Massachusetts]] law states that a posthumous child is treated as having been living at the death of the parent,<ref name=Sekino/> meaning that the child receives the same share of the parent's estate as if the child had been born before the parent's death. Another emerging legal issue in the United States is the control of genetic material after the death of the donor.<ref>{{cite web |title=Frozen in Time: Planning for the Posthumously Conceived Child |url= http://www.natlawreview.com/article/frozen-time-planning-posthumously-conceived-child|publisher=Fairfield and Woods P.C. |work=The National Law Review|date=9 July 2009|accessdate=7 April 2012}}</ref> [[United States]] law holds that posthumous children of U.S. citizens who are born outside the United States have the same rights to citizenship that they would have had if the deceased U.S. citizen parent had been alive at the time of their birth.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://fam.state.gov/FAM/08FAM/08FAM030404.html |title=U.S. Department of State Foreign Affairs Manual Volume 8, 8 FAM 304.4 Posthumous Children |access-date=18 July 2018}}</ref>  In the field of [[assisted reproduction]], [[snowflake children]], i.e.  those \"adopted\" as frozen embryos by people unrelated to them, can result in the birth of a child after the death of one or both of their genetic parents.\n\n===In monarchies===\nA posthumous birth has special significance in the case of [[hereditary monarchy|hereditary monarchies]] following [[primogeniture]]. In this system, a monarch's own child precedes that monarch's sibling in the order of succession. In cases where the widow of a childless king is pregnant at the time of his death, the next-in-line is not permitted to assume the throne,{{cn|date=September 2014}} but must yield place to the unborn child, or ascends and reigns until the child is born.{{cn|date=September 2014}} In monarchies that follow [[male-preference cognatic primogeniture]], the situation is similar where the dead monarch was not childless but left a daughter as the next-in-line, as well as a pregnant widow. A posthumous brother would supplant that daughter in the succession, whereas a posthumous sister, being younger, would not. Similarly, in monarchies that follow [[agnatic primogeniture]], the sex of the unborn child determines the succession; a posthumous male child would himself succeed, whereas the next-in-line would succeed upon the birth of a posthumous female child.\n\n===Modern complications===\nPosthumous [[Fertilization|conception]] by [[artificial insemination]] or [[in vitro fertilization]], whether done using [[sperm]] or [[ovum|ova]] stored before a parent's death or [[posthumous sperm retrieval|sperm retrieved from a man's corpse]], has created new legal issues.<ref name=Sekino>Renee H. Sekino, [http://www.bu.edu/law/scitech/volume8/Sekino.pdf Posthumous Conception: The Birth of a New Class] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040715174044/http://www.bu.edu/law/scitech/volume8/Sekino.pdf |date=15 July 2004 }}, ''Boston University Journal of Sci. and Tech. Law'', 2001.</ref> When a woman is inseminated with her deceased husband's sperm, laws that establish that a [[sperm donor]] is not the legal father of the child born as a result of artificial insemination have had the effect of excluding the deceased husband from fatherhood and making the child legally fatherless.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.lawlink.nsw.gov.au/lrc.nsf/pages/R49CHP12 |title=Report 49 (1986) \u2014 Artificial Conception: Human Artificial Insemination, 12. AIH and Posthumous Use of Semen |publisher=Law Reform Commission, New South Wales}}</ref> In the [[United Kingdom]] before 2000, birth records of children conceived using a dead man's sperm had to identify the infants as fatherless, but in 2000 the government announced that the law would be changed to allow the deceased father's name to be listed on the [[birth certificate]].<ref name=NSW>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/895544.stm |title=Posthumous fathers to be recognised |work=BBC News |date=25 August 2000}}</ref> In 1986, a [[New South Wales]] legal reform commission recommended that the law should recognize the deceased husband as the father of a child born from post-mortem artificial insemination, provided that the woman is his widow and unmarried at the time of birth, but the child should have inheritance rights to the father's estate only if the father left a [[will (law)|will]] that included specific provisions for the child.<ref name=NSW/> In 2001, the [[Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court]] was asked to consider whether the father's name should appear on the birth record for a child conceived through artificial insemination after her father's death, as well as whether that child was eligible for [[U.S. Social Security]] benefits. The court ruled in January 2002 that a child could be the legal heir of a dead parent if there was a genetic relationship and the deceased parent had both agreed to the posthumous conception and committed to support the child.<ref name=Sekino/> Different U.S. state courts and federal appellate courts have ruled differently in similar cases. In 2012, the [[U.S. Supreme Court]] ruled in ''[[Astrue v. Capato]]'' that twins born 18 months after their father's death using the father's frozen sperm were ''not'' eligible for Social Security benefits, which set a new precedent.\n\n==Naming==\nIn the Middle Ages, it was traditional for posthumous children born in [[England]] to be given a [[matronymic]] surname instead of a patronymic one. This may in part explain why matronyms are more common in England than in other parts of Europe.<ref name=bowman>Bowman, William Dodgson. ''The Story of Surnames''. London, George Routledge & Sons, Ltd., 1932. No ISBN.</ref>\n\nIn [[Ancient Rome]], posthumous children of noble birth were often given the [[cognomen]] (or third name) '[[Postumus]].'

This beach is known as the best sun set point in the district. Muttom harbor work has been under construction for last 3 years and was expected to be completed before end of 2014.\n[[File:Muttom Fishing Village.JPG|450px|right|thumbnail|Muttom Fishing Village]]\n\n==Geography==\nMuttom is one of the famous fishing villages, located 16&nbsp;km from the capital town [[Nagercoil]]. It is well connected by road to the [[Nagercoil]] town. It is approximately 75&nbsp;km from the [[Trivandrum]] International Airport. It is reachable from [[Kanyakumari]] by road with a distance of about 34&nbsp;km. The nearest villages are Esanthangu, Ammandivillai, Pillaithoppu, Azhikal, Kadiyapattanam and Manavala Kurichi. Major roads reach Muttom via Ammandivillai, Esanthangu and Nagercoil.\nThere is a  lighthouse which was constructed by British India. The lighthouse, though near the sea, is situated {{cvt|110|ft}} above sea level.

Majority of the people are fishermen who do fishing related works. Most of the people are educated at least to the school level. As most of the residents are Catholics, it has a catholic administration committee which is elected democratically and headed by the [[parish priest]] of the All Saints Church.\n\nThe Thirunanthikarai Cave Temple is one of the founding stones of the Jain religion. Currently the Thirunanthikarai Cave Temple is under the purview and care of Archaeological Survey of India.

He conquered Muttom, and named Mummudi Chola Nalloor as stated in the stone carvings available in the temple. Around the eighth century AD an ascetic named Veeranandi came from Thirunarunkondai Melappalli and stayed here to preach [[Jainism]].\n\n==Education==\nMuttom has a primary school (St. John's primary school), managed by the catholic parish priest of Muttom and headed by the senior most teacher as Headmaster. There also is a higher secondary school by the name of All Saints Higher Secondary School and is managed by the Monfort Brothers. This school has long standing records in both sports and academics. There is a B.Ed college named after Bishop Agneswamy is also established recently and more educational institutions are expected in the coming years. English medium school namely the Model English School, provides a quality education to the children of Muttom as well as neighbouring villages, which is really a benefit to the small fishing villages.\n\n==Light House==\nMuttom has a light house, constructed by the British in colonial times. As recorded in international shipping charts, the lighthouse is situated 110 ft ( 34 m) above sea level . The Skelton was built when India was part of the British Empire until 19476.

A nominal entry fee of Rs.10 is charged for Adults and Rs.3 for students under age 12. Entry is free for School students in uniform.\n\n==Beach==\nMuttom sports a beautiful and tidy beach. Huge rocks standing at either sides of the beach give the beach a pristine look. Since the beach is usually less crowded, it makes an excellent spot for tourists to enjoy its beauty.
