Her many books and articles on topics ranging from [[totalitarianism]] to [[epistemology]] have had a lasting influence on political theory. Arendt is widely considered one of the most important political philosophers of the twentieth century.\n\nArendt was born in [[Hanover]], Germany but mostly raised in [[K\u00f6nigsberg]] in a secular merchant Jewish culture by parents who were politically progressive, being supporters of the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|Social Democrats]]. Her father died when she was seven, so she was raised by her mother and grandfather. After completing her secondary education, she studied at the [[University of Marburg]] under [[Martin Heidegger]], with whom she had a brief affair, and who had a lasting influence on her thinking. She obtained her doctorate in philosophy in 1929 at the [[University of Heidelberg]] with [[Karl Jaspers]].\n\nHannah Arendt married [[G\u00fcnther Stern]] in 1929, but soon began to encounter increasing [[antisemitism]] in 1930s [[Nazi Germany]]. [[Adolf Hitler]] came to power in 1933, and while researching antisemitic propaganda for the [[Zionist Federation of Germany]] in Berlin that year, Arendt was denounced and briefly imprisoned by the [[Gestapo]]. On release, she fled Germany, living in Czechoslovakia and Switzerland before settling in Paris. There she worked for [[Youth Aliyah]], assisting young Jews to emigrate to [[Mandatory Palestine|Palestine]]. Divorcing Stern in 1937, she married [[Heinrich Bl\u00fccher]] in 1940, but when Germany invaded France in 1940 she was detained by the French as an alien, despite having been stripped of her German citizenship in 1937. She escaped and made her way to the United States in 1941 via Portugal. She settled in New York, which remained her principal residence for the rest of her life. She became a writer and editor and worked for the [[Jewish Cultural Reconstruction]], becoming an American citizen in 1950. With the publication of ''[[The Origins of Totalitarianism]]'' in 1951, her reputation as a thinker and writer was established and a series of seminal works followed. These included ''[[The Human Condition (book)|The Human Condition]]'' in 1958, as well as ''[[Eichmann in Jerusalem]]'' and ''[[On Revolution]]'' in 1963. She taught at many American universities, while declining [[tenure-track]] appointments. She died suddenly of a [[Myocardial infarction|heart attack]] in 1975, at the age of 69, leaving her last work, ''[[The Life of the Mind]]'', unfinished.\n\nHer works cover a broad range of topics, but she is best known for those dealing with the nature of [[power (sociology)|power]] and [[evil]], as well as politics, [[direct democracy]], [[authority]], and totalitarianism. In the popular mind she is best remembered for the controversy surrounding the trial of [[Adolf Eichmann]], her attempt to explain how ordinary people become actors in totalitarian systems, which was considered by some an [[apologia]], and for the phrase \"[[the banality of evil]]\". She is commemorated by institutions and journals devoted to her thinking, the [[Hannah Arendt Prize]] for political thinking, and on stamps, street names and schools, amongst other things.{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n== Early life and education (1906\u20131929) ==\n=== Family of origin ===\n{{multiple image | header = Parents | align = right | direction = horizontal | total_width = 250 | float = none\n|image1=Martha Cohn.jpg|caption1 = Martha Cohn ca. 1899|alt1= Photo of Hannah's mother, Martha Cohn, in 1899\n|image2=Paul Arendt.jpg|caption2= Paul Arendt ca. 1900|alt2=Photo of Hannah's father, Paul Arendt, in 1900\n}}\nHannah Arendt was born Johanna Cohn Arendt{{sfn|Wood|2004}}{{sfn|LoC|2001}} in 1906 into a comfortable educated secular family of German Jews in [[Linden-Limmer|Linden]], [[Prussia]] (now a part of [[Hanover]]), in [[Wilhelmine Germany]]. Her family were merchants of Russian extraction from [[K\u00f6nigsberg]],{{efn|After [[World War II]] K\u00f6nigsberg became [[Kaliningrad]], Russia }} the [[East Prussia]]n capital. Arendt's grandparents were members of the [[Reform Jewish]] community there. Hannah's paternal grandfather, {{ill|Max Arendt|de}} (1843\u20131913), was a prominent businessman, local politician,{{sfn|Heller|2015|loc=pp.&nbsp;33\u201334}} one of the leaders of the K\u00f6nigsberg Jewish community and a member of the [[Centralverein deutscher Staatsb\u00fcrger j\u00fcdischen Glaubens]] (Central Organization for German Citizens of the Jewish Faith). Like other members of the Centralverein he primarily saw himself as a German and disapproved of the activities of [[Zionism|Zionists]], such as the young [[Kurt Blumenfeld]] (1884\u20131963), who was a frequent visitor to their home and would later become one of Hannah's mentors. Of Max Arendt's children, Paul Arendt (1873\u20131913) was an engineer and [[Henriette Arendt]] (1874\u20131922) was a policewoman who became a social worker.{{sfn|Riepl-Schmidt|2005}}{{sfn|Young-Bruehl|2004|loc=pp.&nbsp;8\u20139}}\n\nHannah was the only child of Paul and Martha (born Cohn) Arendt (1874\u20131948),{{sfn|Geni|2018}} who were married on 11 April 1902. She was named after her paternal grandmother.{{sfn|Young-Bruehl|2004|loc=p.&nbsp;17}}{{sfn|McGowan|1998}} The Cohns had originally come to K\u00f6nigsberg from nearby Russian territory (now [[Lithuania]]) in 1852, as refugees from anti-Semitism, and made their living as tea importers; J.

The Arendts had reached Germany from Russia a century earlier.{{sfn|Gould|2009|loc=p.&nbsp;65}}{{sfn|Young-Bruehl|2004|loc=pp.&nbsp;5\u20137}}  Hannah's extended family contained many more women, who shared the loss of husbands and children. Hannah's parents were better educated and politically more to the left than her grandparents, both being members of the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|Social Democrats]], {{sfn|Wood|2004}} rather than the [[German Democratic Party]] that most of their contemporaries supported. Paul Arendt was educated at the Albertina ([[University of K\u00f6nigsberg]]). Though he worked as an engineer, he prided himself on his love of [[Classics]]. He collected a large library, in which Hannah immersed herself. Martha Cohn, a musician, had studied for three years in Paris.{{sfn|Young-Bruehl|2004|loc=pp.&nbsp;8\u20139}}\n\nIn the first four years of their marriage, the Arendts lived in Berlin, where they were supporters of the socialist journal ''[[Sozialistische Monatshefte]]''.{{efn|''Sozialistische Monatshefte'' was edited by the K\u00f6nigsberg Jewish scholar, [[:de:Joseph Bloch|Joseph Bloch]], and formed the focal point of Martha Arendt's K\u00f6nigsberg socialist discussion group}}{{sfn|Young-Bruehl|2004|loc=p.&nbsp;27}} At the time of Hannah's birth, Paul Arendt was employed by an electrical engineering firm in Linden, and they lived in a frame house on the market square (Marktplatz).{{sfn|Young-Bruehl|2004|loc=p.&nbsp;13}} The Arendt family moved back to K\u00f6nigsberg in 1909, because of Paul's deteriorating health.{{sfn|Young-Bruehl|2004|loc=p.&nbsp;5}}{{sfn|Yar|2018}} Hannah's father suffered from a prolonged illness with [[syphilis]] and had to be institutionalized in the K\u00f6nigsberg psychiatric hospital in 1911.

At the time the young Hannah confided that she wished to marry him when she grew up.{{sfn|Young-Bruehl|2004|loc=pp.&nbsp;8\u20139}} Her family moved in circles that included many intellectuals and professionals. It was a social circle of high standards and ideals.

Die Forderung des Tages'' (And just what is your duty? The demands of the day). Goethe, at the time, was considered the essential mentor of ''Bildung'' (education), the conscious formation of mind, body and spirit. The key elements were considered to be self-discipline, constructive channeling of passion, renunciation and responsibility for others.  Hannah's developmental progress (''Entwicklung'') was carefully documented by her mother in a book, which she titled ''Unser Kind'' (Our Child) and measured her against the benchmark of what was then considered ''normale Entwicklung'' (\"normal development\").{{sfn|Young-Bruehl|2004|loc=pp.&nbsp;12\u201313}}\n\nArendt attended kindergarten from 1910 where her precocity impressed her teachers and enrolled in the [[Szittnich School, K\u00f6nigsberg]] (Hufen-Oberlyzeum), on Bahnstrasse in August 1913,{{sfn|Young-Bruehl|2004|loc=pp.&nbsp;16,19}} but her studies there were interrupted by the outbreak of World War I, forcing the family to temporarily flee to [[Berlin]] on 23 August 1914, in the face of the advancing Russian army.{{sfn|Young-Bruehl|2004|loc=p.&nbsp;21}} There they stayed with her mother's younger sister, Margarethe F\u00fcrst (1884\u20131942),{{efn|Margarethe delayed fleeing Germany when her sister did, and was deported to a camp in 1941, where she died{{sfn|Geni|2018}} }} and her three children, while Hannah attended a girl's ''[[Lyzeum]]'' school in [[Berlin-Charlottenburg]]. After ten weeks, when K\u00f6nigsberg appeared to be no longer threatened, the Arendts were able to return,{{sfn|Young-Bruehl|2004|loc=p.&nbsp;21}} where they spent the remaining war years at her grandfather's house. Arendt's precocity continued, learning [[ancient Greek language|ancient Greek]] as a child,{{sfn|Villa|2009}} writing poetry in her teenage years,{{sfn|Young-Bruehl|2004|loc=p.&nbsp;3}} and starting both a philosophy club and Greek ''Graecae'' at her school.

By the age of 16, she had read [[Kierkegaard]], [[Karl Jaspers|Jaspers]]' ''Psychologie der Weltanschauungen'' and [[Kant]]'s ''Kritik der reinen Vernunft'' (''[[Critique of Pure Reason]]''). Kant, whose home town was also K\u00f6nigsberg, was an important influence on her thinking, and it was Kant who had written about K\u00f6nigsberg that \"such a town is the right place for gaining knowledge concerning men and the world even without travelling\".{{sfn|Kant|2006|loc=p.&nbsp;4}}{{sfn|Young-Bruehl|2004|loc=p.&nbsp;36}}\n\nArendt attended the [[K\u00f6nigin-Luise-Schule]] for her secondary education, a girls' [[gymnasium (Germany)|''Gymnasium'']] on Landhofmeisterstrasse.{{sfn|Heller|2015a}} Most of her friends, while at school, were gifted children of Jewish professional families, generally older than her and went on to university education.

She was ready for passion, finishing her poem ''Trost'' (Consolation, 1923) with the lines:\n\n<blockquote>''Die Stunden verrinnen,<br />Die Tage vergehen,<br />Es bleibt ein Gewinnen<br />Das blosse Bestehen.''<br />\n(The hours run down<br />The days pass on.<br />One achievement remains:<br />Mere being alive{{sfn|Young-Bruehl|2004|loc=pp.&nbsp;49,479}})</blockquote>\n\nHer encounter with Heidegger represented a dramatic departure from the past. He was handsome, a genius, romantic and taught that thinking and \"aliveness\" were but one.{{sfn|Young-Bruehl|2004|loc=p.&nbsp;49}} The 17-year-old Arendt then began a long romantic relationship with the 35-year-old Heidegger,{{sfn|Grunenberg|2017}} who was married with two young sons.{{efn|Martin Heidegger, a Roman Catholic, had married Elfride Petri on 21 March 1917.

Nevertheless, he remained one of the most profound influences on her thinking,{{sfn|Maier-Katkin|2010a}} and he would later relate that she had been the inspiration for his work on passionate thinking in those days. They agreed to keep the details of the relationship a secret, preserving their letters but keeping them unavailable.{{sfn|Young-Bruehl|2004|loc=p.&nbsp;50}}  The relationship was not known until [[Elisabeth Young-Bruehl]]'s biography of Arendt appeared in 1982, by which time Arendt and Heidegger had both died, though Heidegger's wife, Elfride (1893\u20131992), was still alive. Nevertheless, the affair was not well known until 1995, when [[Elzbieta Ettinger]] gained access to the sealed correspondence{{sfn|Kohler|1996}} and published a controversial account that was used by Arendt's detractors to cast doubt on her integrity. That account,{{efn|Ettinger set out to write a biography of Arendt, but, being in poor health, never completed it, only this chapter being published as a separate work before she died{{sfn|Brent|2013}}}} which caused a scandal, was subsequently refuted.{{sfn|Lilla|1999}}{{sfn|Young-Bruehl|2004|loc=p.&nbsp;\nxiv}}{{sfn|Brent|2013}}\n\nAt Marburg, Arendt lived at Lutherstrasse 4.{{sfn|Young-Bruehl|2004}} Among her friends there was [[Hans Jonas]], her only Jewish classmate.

The conscious renunciation of the demand to be heard, the despair at not being able to be heard, and finally the need to speak even without an answer\u2013these are the real reasons for the darkness, asperity, and tension of the style in which poetry indicates its own possibilities and its will to form{{efn|''Echolosigkeit und das Wissen um die Vergeblichkeit ist die paradoxe, zweideutige und verzweifelte Situation, aus der allein die Duineser Elegien zu verstehen sind.

While G\u00fcnther was working on his ''Habilitationsschrift'', Arendt had abandoned the original subject of German Romanticism for her thesis in 1930, and turned instead to Rahel Varnhagen and the question of assimilation.{{sfn|Young-Bruehl|2004|loc=p.&nbsp;85}}{{sfn|Zebad\u00faa Y\u00e1\u00f1ez|2017}} Anne Mendelssohn had accidentally acquired a copy of Varhagen's correspondence and excitedly introduced her to Arendt, donating her collection to her.

In Rahel, she found qualities she felt reflected her own, particularly those of sensibility and vulnerability.{{sfn|Young-Bruehl|2004|loc=p.&nbsp;56}} Rahel, like Hannah, found her destiny in her Jewishness. Hannah Arendt would come to call Rahel Varnhagen's discovery of living with her destiny as being a \"conscious pariah\".{{sfn|Young-Bruehl|2004|loc=p.&nbsp;38}} This was a personal trait that Arendt had recognized in herself, although she did not embrace the term until later.{{sfn|Young-Bruehl|2004|loc=p.&nbsp;39}}\n\nBack in Berlin, Arendt found herself becoming more involved in politics and started studying political theory, and reading [[Marx]] and [[Trotsky]], while developing contacts at the [[Deutsche Hochschule f\u00fcr Politik]].{{sfn|Young-Bruehl|2004|loc=p.&nbsp;92}} Despite the political leanings of her mother and husband she never saw herself as a political leftist, justifying her activism as being through her Jewishness.{{sfn|Young-Bruehl|2004|loc=pp.&nbsp;104\u2013105}} Her increasing interest in Jewish politics and her examination of assimilation in her study of Varnhagen led her to publish her first article on [[Judaism]], ''[[:de:Aufkl\u00e4rung und Judenfrage|Aufkl\u00e4rung und Judenfrage]]'' (\"The Enlightenment and the Jewish Question\", 1932).{{sfn|Arendt-Stern|1932}}{{sfn|Young-Bruehl|2004|loc=p.&nbsp;93}} Blumenfeld had introduced her to the \"[[Jewish question]]\", which would be his lifelong concern.{{sfn|Young-Bruehl|2004|loc=p.&nbsp;xxxix}} Meanwhile, her views on German Romanticism were evolving. She wrote a review of [[:de:Hans Weil|Hans Weil]]'s ''Die Entstehung des deutschen Bildungsprinzips'' (''The Origin of German Educational Principle'', 1930),{{sfn|Weil|1967}} which dealt with the emergence of ''[[:de:Bildungselite|Bildungselite]]'' (educational elite) in the time of Rahel Varnhagen.{{sfn|Arendt|1931}} At the same time she began to be occupied by [[Max Weber]]'s description of the status of Jewish people within a state as ''pariavolk'' ([[outcast (person)|pariah]] people) in his ''[[Wirtschaft und Gesellschaft]]'' (1922),{{sfn|Weber|1978|loc=p.&nbsp;493''ff''}}{{sfn|Swedberg|Agevall|2016|loc=p.&nbsp;245\u2013246}} while borrowing [[Bernard Lazare]]'s term ''paria conscient'' (conscious pariah){{sfn|Lazare|2016|loc=p.&nbsp;8}} with which she identified.{{efn|''Pariavolk'': In ''Religionssoziologie'' (The Sociology of Religion).

Eine psychologische Bilanz'' (Contemporary Women's Issues: A psychological balance sheet).{{sfn|R\u00fchle-Gerstel|1932}} Although not a supporter of the women's movement, the review was sympathetic. At least in terms of the status of women at that time, she was skeptical of the movement's ability to achieve political change.{{sfn|Bagchi|2007}} She was also critical of the movement, because it ''was'' a women's movement, rather than contributing with men to a political movement, abstract rather than striving for concrete goals. In this manner she echoed Rosa Luxemburg. Like Luxemburg, she would later criticize Jewish movements for the same reason. Arendt consistently prioritized political over social questions.{{sfn|Young-Bruehl|2004|loc=pp.&nbsp;95\u201397}}\n\nBy 1932, faced with a deteriorating political situation, Arendt was deeply troubled by reports that Heidegger was speaking at [[National Socialist]] meetings. She wrote, asking him to deny that he was attracted to National Socialism. Heidegger replied that he did not seek to deny the rumors (which were true), and merely assured her that his feelings for her were unchanged.{{sfn|Kirsch|2009}} As a Jew in Nazi Germany, Arendt was prevented from making a living and discriminated against and confided to Anne Mendelssohn that emigration was probably inevitable. Jaspers had tried to persuade her to consider herself as a German first, a position she distanced herself from, pointing out that she was a Jew and that \"''F\u00fcr mich ist Deutschland die Muttersprache, die Philosophie und die Dichtung''\" (For me, Germany is the mother tongue, philosophy and poetry), rather than her identity. This position puzzled Jaspers, replying \"It is strange to me that as a Jew you want to be different from the Germans\".{{sfn|Arendt|Jaspers|1992|loc=pp.&nbsp;52ff}}\n\nBy 1933, life for the Jewish population in Germany was becoming precarious. [[Adolf Hitler]] became [[Chancellor of Germany|''Reichskanzler'' (Chancellor)]] in January, and the [[Reichstag fire|Reichstag was burned down]] (''Reichstagsbrand'') the following month. This led to the suspension of [[civil liberties]], with attacks on the left, and, in particular, members of the [[Kommunistische Partei Deutschlands]] (German Communist Party: KPD). Stern, who had communist associations, fled to Paris, but Arendt stayed on to become an activist. Knowing her time was limited, she used the apartment at Opitzstrasse 6 in [[Berlin-Steglitz]] that she had occupied with Stern since 1932 as an underground railway way-station for fugitives.

The beginnings of anti-Jewish laws and boycott came in the spring of 1933.

Arendt had access to the [[Prussian State Library]] for her work on Varnhagen.

The women were gathered together in the [[V\u00e9lodrome d'Hiver]] on 15 May, so Hannah Arendt's mother, being over 55, was allowed to stay in Paris.

Versuch einer philosophischen Interpretation''{{sfn|Arendt|1929}} (''Love and Saint Augustine''), was published in 1929 and attracted critical interest, although an English translation did not appear until 1996.{{sfn|Arendt|1996}} In this work, she combines approaches of both Heidegger and Jaspers. Arendt's interpretation of love in the work of Augustine deals with three concepts, love as craving or desire (''Amor qua appetitus''), love in the relationship between man (''creatura'') and creator (''Creator - Creatura''), and neighborly love (''Dilectio proximi''). Love as craving anticipates the future, while love for the Creator deals with the remembered past. Of the three, ''dilectio proximi''  or ''[[Charity (virtue)|caritas]]''{{efn|Latin has three nouns for love: ''amor'', ''dilectio'' and ''caritas''. The corresponding verbs for the first two are ''amare'' and ''diligere''{{sfn|Augustine|1995|loc=p.&nbsp;115 n.&nbsp;31}}}} is perceived as the most fundamental, to which the first two are oriented, which she treats under ''vita socialis'' (social life). The second of the [[Great Commandments]] (or [[Golden Rule]]) \"Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself\" uniting and transcending the former.{{efn|{{bibleref|Matthew|22:39|KJV}} }}{{sfn|Young-Bruehl|2004|loc=p.&nbsp;74}} Augustine's influence (and Jaspers' views on his work)  persisted in Arendt's writings for the rest of her life.{{sfn|Calcagno|2013}}\n\n{{quotebox|title=''Amor mundi''|align=right| quote= <poem>''Amor mundi\u200a\u2014\u200awarum ist es so schwer, die Welt zu lieben?''<br />Love of the world\u200a\u2014\u200awhy is it so difficult to love the world?</poem>|source= \u2014''Denktagebuch'' I: 522{{sfn|Arendt|2002a|loc=p.&nbsp;522}}}}\n\nSome of the [[leitmotifs]] of her canon were apparent, introducing the concept of ''[[:de:Natalit\u00e4t|Natalit\u00e4t]]'' (Natality) as a key condition of human existence and its role in the development of the individual,{{sfn|Arendt|1996}}{{sfn|Beiner|1997}}{{sfn|Kiess|2016|loc=pp.&nbsp;22,40}} developing this further in ''The Human Condition'' (1958).{{sfn|Arendt|2013}}{{sfn|Fry|2014}} She explained that the construct of natality was implied in her discussion of new beginnings and man's elation to the Creator as ''nova creatura''.{{sfn|Young-Bruehl|2004|loc=pp.&nbsp;49\u2013500}}{{sfn|Kiess|2016|loc=pp.&nbsp;101''ff''}} The centrality of the theme of birth and renewal is apparent in the constant reference to Augustinian thought, and specifically the innovative nature of birth, from this, her first work, to her last, ''The Life of the Mind''.{{sfn|Durst|2004}}\n\nLove is another connecting theme. In addition to the Augustinian loves expostulated in her dissertation, the phrase ''amor mundi'' (love of the world) is one often associated with Arendt and both permeates her work and was an absorbing passion throughout her work.{{sfn|Bernauer|1987a|loc=p.&nbsp;1}}{{sfn|Hill|2017}} She took the phrase from Augustine's homily on the [[:s:Nicene and Post-Nicene Fathers: Series I/Volume VII/First Epistle of John/Part 2|first epistle of St John]], \"If love of the world dwell in us\".{{sfn|Augustine|2008|loc=II: 8 p.&nbsp;45}} ''Amor mundi'' was her original title for ''The Human Condition'' (1958),{{efn|Arendt explained to Karl Jaspers, in a letter dated 6 August 1955, that she intended to use St Augustine's concept of ''amor mundi'' as the title, as a token of gratitude{{sfn|Vollrath|1997}}}}{{sfn|Bernauer|1987|loc=p.&nbsp;v}} the subtitle of Elisabeth Young-Bruehl's biography (1982),{{sfn|Young-Bruehl|2004}} the title of a collection of writing on faith in her work{{sfn|Bernauer|1987}} and is the newsletter of the Hannah Arendt Center at Bard College.{{sfn|Amor Mundi|2018}}\n\n=== ''The Origins of Totalitarianism'' (1951) ===\n{{Main|The Origins of Totalitarianism}}\nArendt's first major book, ''The Origins of Totalitarianism'' (1951),{{sfn|Arendt|1976}} examined the roots of [[Communism]] and [[Nazism]], structured as three essays, \"Antisemitism\", \"Imperialism\" and \"Totalitarianism\". Arendt argues that totalitarianism was a \"novel form of government,\" that \"differs essentially from other forms of political oppression known to us such as despotism, tyranny and dictatorship\"{{sfn|Arendt|1976|loc=p.&nbsp;460}} in that it applied terror to subjugate mass populations rather than just political adversaries.{{sfn|Arendt|1953}}{{sfn|FCG|2018|loc=Introduction}} Criticism included the interpretation that the two movements were portrayed as equally tyrannical.{{sfn|Nisbet|1992}} Arendt also maintained that Jewry was not the operative factor in the Holocaust, but merely a convenient proxy because Nazism was about terror and consistency, not merely eradicating Jews.{{sfn|Riesman|1951}}{{sfn|FCG|2018|loc=Introduction}} Arendt explained the tyranny using Kant's phrase \"Radical Evil\",{{sfn|Copjec|1996}} by which their victims became \"Superfluous People\".{{sfn|Hattem|Hattem|2005}}{{sfn|Heller|2015|loc=p.&nbsp;7}} In later editions she enlarged the text {{sfn|Arendt|1976|loc=p.&nbsp;xxiv}} to include her work on \"Ideology and Terror: A novel form of government\"{{sfn|Arendt|1953}} and the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956|Hungarian Revolution]], but then published the latter separately.{{sfn|Arendt|1958}}{{sfn|Arendt|1958a}}{{sfn|Sz\u00e9cs\u00e9nyi|2005}}\n\n=== ''Rahel Varnhagen: The Life of a Jewess'' (1957) ===\n\n{{Main|Rahel Varnhagen (book)}}\n\nArendt's ''Habilitationsschrift'' on Rahel Varnhagen was completed while she was living in exile in Paris in 1938, but not published till 1957, in the United Kingdom by East and West Library, part of the Leo Baeck Institute.{{sfn|Aschheim|2011}} This biography of a nineteenth century Jewish socialite, formed an important step in her analysis of Jewish history and the subjects of [[Jewish assimilation|assimilation]] and [[emancipation]], and introduced her treatment of the [[Jewish diaspora]] as either ''pariah'' or ''parvenu''.

Her account of Varnhagen's life was perceived during a time of the destruction of German-Jewish culture. It partially reflects Arendt's own view of herself as a German-Jewish woman driven out of her own culture into a [[Statelessness|stateless]] existence,{{sfn|Grunenberg|2003|loc=p.&nbsp;34}} leading to the description \"biography as autobiography\".{{sfn|Young-Bruehl|2004|loc=pp&nbsp;.85\u201392}}{{sfn|Goldstein|2009}}{{sfn|Cutting-Gray|1991}}\n\n=== ''The Human Condition'' (1958) ===\n{{Main|The Human Condition (book)|l1=The Human Condition}}\nIn what is arguably her most influential work, ''[[The Human Condition (book)|The Human Condition]]'' (1958),{{sfn|Arendt|2013}} Arendt differentiates political and social concepts, labor and work, and various forms of actions; she then explores the implications of those distinctions. Her theory of political action, corresponding to the existence of a public realm, is extensively developed in this work. Arendt argues that, while human life always evolves within societies, the social part of human nature, political life, has been intentionally realized in only a few societies as a space for individuals to achieve freedom. Conceptual categories, which attempt to bridge the gap between [[ontological]] and sociological structures, are sharply delineated. While Arendt relegates labor and work to the realm of the social, she favors the human condition of action as that which is both existential and aesthetic.{{sfn|d'Entreves|2014}} Of human actions, Arendt identifies two that she considers essential. These are forgiving past wrong (or unfixing the fixed past) and promising future benefit (or fixing the unfixed future).{{sfn|Baier|1997|loc=p.&nbsp;330}}\n\nArendt had first introduced the concept of \"natality\" in her ''Love and Saint Augustine'' (1929){{sfn|Arendt|1929}} and in ''The Human Condition'' starts to develop this further. In this, she departs from Heidegger's emphasis on mortality. Arendt's positive message is one of the \"miracle of beginning\", the continual arrival of the new to create action, that is to alter the state of affairs brought about by previous actions.{{sfn|Canovan|2013}} \"Men\", she wrote \"though they must die, are not born in order to die but in order to begin\". She defined her use of \"natality\" as:\n\n<blockquote>The miracle that saves the world, the realm of human affairs, from its normal, \"natural\" ruin is ultimately the fact of natality, in which the faculty of action is ontologically rooted. It is, in other words, the birth of new men and the new beginning, the action they are capable of by virtue of being born.{{sfn|Arendt|2013|loc=p.&nbsp;247}}</blockquote>\n\nNatality would go on to become a central concept of her political theory, and also what Karin Fry considers its most optimistic one.{{sfn|Fry|2014}}\n\n=== ''Between Past and Future'' (1954...1968) ===\n{{Main|Between Past and Future|l1=Between Past and Future}}\n''Between Past and Future'' is an [[anthology]] of eight essays written between 1954 and 1968, dealing with a variety of different but connected philosophical subjects. These essays share the central idea that humans live between the past and the uncertain future. Man must permanently think to exist, but must learn thinking. Humans have resorted to tradition, but are abandoning respect for this tradition and culture. Arendt tries to find solutions to help humans think again, since modern philosophy has not succeeded in helping humans to live correctly.{{sfn|Arendt|1961}}\n\n=== ''On Revolution'' (1963) ===\n{{main|On Revolution}}\nArendt's book ''On Revolution''{{sfn|Arendt|2006b}} presents a comparison of two of the main revolutions of the eighteenth century, the [[American Revolution|American]] and [[French Revolution|French]] Revolutions. She goes against a common impression of both Marxist and [[leftist]] views when she argues that France, while well-studied and often emulated, was a disaster and that the largely ignored American Revolution was a success. The turning point in the French Revolution occurred when the leaders rejected their goals of freedom in order to focus on compassion for the masses. In the [[United States]], the founders never betray the goal of ''{{lang|la|Constitutio Libertatis}}''. Arendt believes the revolutionary spirit of those men had been lost, however, and advocates a \"council system\" as an appropriate institution to regain that spirit.{{sfn|Wellmer|1999}}\n\n=== ''Men in Dark Times'' (1968) ===\n\nThe anthology of essays ''Men in Dark Times'' presents intellectual biographies of some creative and moral figures of the twentieth century, such as Walter Benjamin, Karl Jaspers, Rosa Luxemburg, [[Hermann Broch]], [[Pope John XXIII]], and [[Isak Dinesen]].{{sfn|Arendt|1968}}\n\n=== ''Crises of the Republic'' (1972) ===\n{{main|Crises of the Republic}}\n''Crises of the Republic''{{sfn|Arendt|1972}} was the third of Arendt's anthologies, consisting of four essays, \"Lying in Politics\", \"Civil Disobedience\", \"On Violence\" and \"Thoughts on Politics and Revolution\". These related essays deal with contemporary American politics and the crises it faced in the 1960s and 1970s. \"Lying in Politics\" looks for an explanation behind the administration's deception regarding the [[Vietnam War]], as revealed in the ''[[Pentagon Papers]]''. \"Civil Disobedience\" examines the opposition movements, while the final \"Thoughts on Politics and Revolution\" is a commentary, in the form of an interview on the third essay, \"On Violence\".{{sfn|Arendt|1972}}{{sfn|Nott|1972}} In \"On Violence\" Arendt substantiates that violence presupposes power which she understands as a property of groups. Thus, she breaks with the predominant conception of power as derived from violence.\n\n=== Poetry ===\n\nArendt was a minor poet, but kept this very private.{{sfn|Young-Bruehl|2004|loc=p.&nbsp;3}}{{sfn|Waterhouse|2013}}{{sfn|Bertheau|2016}} She had started writing at seventeen, and her work is marked by a deep [[Melancholia|melancholy]] she called ''M\u00fcdigkeit'' (weariness), a Romantic yearning from the past steeped in Kierkegaardian angst.

Since then a number of her minor works have been collected and published, mainly under the editorship of Jerome Kohn. In 1994 \"Essays in Understanding\" appeared as the first of a series covering the period 1930\u20131954, but attracted little attention. A new version of ''Origins of Totalitarianism'' appeared in 2004 followed by ''The Promise of Politics'' in 2005. The renewed interest in Arendtiana following these publications led to a second series of essays, ''Thinking Without a Banister: Essays in Understanding, 1953-1975'', published in 2018. Other collections have dealt with her Jewish identity, including ''The Jew as Pariah'' (1978) and ''The Jewish Writings'' (2007), moral philosophy including ''Lectures on Kant's Political Philosophy'' (1982) and ''Responsibility and Judgment'' (2003), together with her literary works as ''Reflections on Literature and Culture'' (2007).{{sfn|Miller|2017}}\n\n==== ''The Life of the Mind'' (1978) ====\n{{main|The Life of the Mind}}\n[[File:Immanuel Kant (painted portrait).jpg|thumb|upright|[[Immanuel Kant]]|alt=Portrait of Kant ]]\nArendt's last major work, ''The Life of the Mind''{{sfn|Arendt|1978a}} remained incomplete at the time of her death, but marked a return to moral philosophy. The outline of the book was based on her graduate level political philosophy class, ''Philosophy of the Mind'', and her [[Gifford Lectures]] in Scotland.{{sfn|Addison|1972\u20131974}} She conceived of the work as a trilogy based on the mental activities of thinking, willing, and judging. Her most recent work had focused on the first two, but went beyond this in terms of ''{{lang|la|vita activa}}''. her discussion of thinking was based on [[Socrates]] and his notion of thinking as a solitary dialogue between oneself, leading her to novel concepts of conscience.{{sfn|Ojakangas|2010}}\n\nArendt died suddenly five days after completing the second part, with the first page of Judging, still in her typewriter, and McCarthy then edited the first two parts and provided some indication of the direction of the third.{{sfn|Young-Bruehl|2004|loc=p.&nbsp;467}}{{sfn|Mckenna|1978}} Arendt's exact intentions for the third part are unknown but she left a number of manuscripts (such as ''Thinking and Moral Considerations'', ''Some Questions on Moral Philosophy'' and ''Lectures on Kant's Political Philosophy'') relating to her thoughts on the mental [[Aesthetic judgment|faculty of Judging]]. These have since been published separately.{{sfn|Arendt|2009}}{{sfn|Arendt|1992}}\n\n==== Collected works ====\n\nAfter Hannah Arendt's death a number of her essays and notes have continued to be edited and published posthumously by friends and colleagues, including those that give some insight into the unfinished third part of ''[[#The Life of the Mind|The Life of the Mind]]''.{{sfn|Miller|2017}} ''The Jew as Pariah: Jewish Identity and Politics in the Modern Age'' (1978),{{sfn|Arendt|1978b}} is a collection of 15 essays and letters from the period 1943\u20131966 on the situation of Jews in modern times, to try and throw some light on her views on the Jewish world, following the backlash to ''Eichmann'', but proved to be equally polarizing.{{sfn|Dannhauser|1979}}{{sfn|Botstein|1983}} A further collection of her writings on being Jewish was published as ''The Jewish Writings'' (2007).{{sfn|Arendt|2009a}}{{sfn|Butler|2007}} Other work includes the collection of forty, largely fugitive,{{efn|Fugitive writings: Dealing with subjects of passing interest}} essays, addresses, and reviews entitled ''Essays in Understanding 1930\u20131954: Formation, Exile, and Totalitarianism'' (1994),{{sfn|Arendt|2011}} that presaged her monumental ''The Origins of Totalitarianism'',{{sfn|Arendt|1976}} in particular ''On the Nature of Totalitarianism'' (1953) and ''The Concern with Politics in Contemporary European Philosophical Thought'' (1954).{{sfn|Teichman|1994}} The remaining essays were published as ''Thinking Without a Banister: Essays in Understanding, 1953-1975'' (2018).{{sfn|Arendt|2018}} Her notebooks which form a series of memoirs, were published as ''Denktagebuch'' in 2002.{{sfn|Arendt|2002a}}{{sfn|Arendt|2002b}}{{sfn|Berkowitz|Storey|2017}}\n\n==== {{vanchor|Correspondence}} ====\n\nSome further insight into her thinking is provided in the continuing posthumous publication of her correspondence with many of the important figures in her life, including Karl Jaspers (1992),{{sfn|Arendt|Jaspers|1992}} Mary McCarthy (1995),{{sfn|Arendt|McCarthy|1995}} Heinrich Bl\u00fccher (1996),{{sfn|Arendt|Bl\u00fccher|2000}} Martin Heidegger (2004),{{efn|Arendt/Heidegger: Arendt willed that her correspondence be taken to the Deutsches Literaturarchiv in Marbach in 1976 and sealed for 5 years, and Heidegger's family stipulated that it remained sealed during Martin Heidegger's wife Elfride's lifetime (1893\u20131992).

Also she had witnessed \"little of the Nazi regime directly\"{{efn|Arendt to Jaspers, 2 December 1960}}{{sfn|Arendt|Jaspers|1992|loc=pp.&nbsp;409\u2013410}} and this was an opportunity to witness an agent of totalitarianism first hand.{{sfn|Heller|2015|loc=p.&nbsp;7}}\n\nThe offer was accepted and she attended six weeks of the five-month trial with her young cousin from Israel, [[:de:Edna Brocke|Edna Brocke]].{{sfn|Heller|2015|loc=p.&nbsp;2}} On arrival she was treated as a celebrity, meeting with the trial chief judge, [[Moshe Landau]], and the [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Israel)|foreign minister]], [[Golda Meir]].{{sfn|Heller|2015|loc=p.&nbsp;8}} In her subsequent 1963 report,{{sfn|Arendt|1963}} based on her observations and transcripts,{{sfn|Heller|2015|loc=p.&nbsp;2}} and which evolved into the book ''[[Eichmann in Jerusalem: A Report on the Banality of Evil]]'',{{sfn|Arendt|2006a}} Arendt was critical of the way the trial was conducted by the Israelis as a \"show trial\" with ulterior motives other than simply trying evidence and administering justice.{{sfn|NYT|1960a}}{{sfn|Heller|2015|loc=p.&nbsp;8}} She portrayed the prosecutor, [[Attorney General of Israel|Attorney General]] [[Gideon Hausner]], as one who employed hyperbolic rhetoric in the pursuit of [[Prime Minister of Israel|Prime Minister]] [[Ben-Gurion]]'s political agenda.{{sfn|Heller|2015|loc=p.&nbsp;8\u201311}} Arendt, who believed she could maintain her focus on moral principles in the face of outrage, became increasingly frustrated with Hausner, describing his parade of survivors as having \"no apparent bearing on the case\".{{efn|A position that the judges would later agree with{{sfn|Heller|2015|loc=p.&nbsp;12}}}}{{sfn|Arendt|2006a|loc=p.&nbsp;207}} She objected to the idea that a strong Israel was necessary to protect world Jewry being again placed where \"they'll let themselves be slaughtered like sheep\", recalling the [[Like sheep to the slaughter|biblical phrase]].{{efn|Arendt to Jaspers, 23 December 1960}}{{sfn|Arendt|Jaspers|1992|loc=pp.&nbsp;416}} She was particularly concerned that Hausner repeatedly asked \"why did you not rebel?\",{{sfn|Arendt|2006a|loc=p.&nbsp;124}} rather than question the role of the Jewish leaders, as she would do with unforeseen consequences.{{sfn|Heller|2015|loc=p.&nbsp;12}}\n\nMost famously, Arendt coined the phrase \"the [[banality of evil]]\" to describe the phenomenon of Eichmann. She, like others,{{sfn|Gellhorn|1962}} was struck by his very ordinariness and the demeanor he exhibited of a small, slightly balding, bland bureaucrat, in contrast to the horrific crimes he stood accused of.{{sfn|Scott|2016}} He was, she wrote, \"terribly and terrifyingly normal\".{{sfn|Arendt|2006a|loc=p.&nbsp;276}} She examined the question of whether [[evil]] is radical or simply a function of thoughtlessness, a tendency of ordinary people to obey orders and conform to mass opinion without a critical evaluation of the consequences of their actions. Arendt's argument was that Eichmann was not a monster, contrasting the immensity of his actions with the very ordinariness of the man himself. Eichmann, she stated, not only called himself a Zionist, having initially opposed the Jewish persecution, but also expected his captors to understand him. She pointed out that his actions were not driven by malice, but rather blind dedication to the regime and his need to belong, to be a joiner.\n\nOn this, Arendt would later state \"Going along with the rest and wanting to say 'we' were quite enough to make the greatest of all crimes possible\".{{efn|\"''Er wollte Wir sagen, und dies Mitmachen und dies Wir-Sagen-Wollen war ja ganz genug, um die allergr\u00f6ssten Verbrechen m\u00f6glich zu machen.''\"}}{{sfn|Arendt|Fest|1964}} What Arendt observed during the trial was a bourgeois sales clerk who found a meaningful role for himself and a sense of importance in the Nazi movement. She noted that his addiction to clich\u00e9s and use of bureaucratic morality clouded his ability to question his actions, \"to think\". This led her to set out her most famous, and most debated, dictum: \"the lesson that this long course in human wickedness had taught us \u2013 the lesson of the fearsome, word-and-thought-defying banality of evil\".{{sfn|Arendt|1963}}{{sfn|Berkowitz|2013}} By stating that Eichmann did not think, she did not imply lack of conscious awareness of his actions, but by \"thinking\" she implied reflective rationality, that was lacking. Arendt, who eschewed [[identity politics]], was also critical of the way Israel depicted Eichmann's crimes as crimes against a nation state, rather than against humanity itself.{{sfn|Butler|2011}}\n\nArendt was also critical of the way that some Jewish leaders associated with the Jewish Councils ([[Judenr\u00e4te]]), notably [[Mordechai Chaim Rumkowski|M. C. Rumkowski]], acted during [[the Holocaust]], in cooperating with Eichmann \"almost without exception\" in the destruction of their own people.{{sfn|Arendt|2006a|loc=p.&nbsp;123}} She had expressed concerns on this point, prior to the trial.{{efn|Arendt to Jaspers, 23 December 1960}}{{sfn|Arendt|Jaspers|1992|loc=p.&nbsp;417}} She described this as a moral catastrophe. While her argument was not to allocate blame, rather she mourned what she considered a moral failure of compromising the imperative that it is better to suffer wrong than to do wrong. She describes the cooperation of the Jewish leaders in terms of a disintegration of Jewish morality: \"This role of the Jewish leaders in the destruction of their own people is undoubtedly the darkest chapter in the whole dark story\". Widely misunderstood, this caused an even greater controversy and particularly animosity toward her in the Jewish community and in Israel.{{sfn|Berkowitz|2013}} For Arendt, the Eichmann trial marked a turning point in her thinking in the final decade of her life, becoming increasingly preoccupied with [[moral philosophy]].{{sfn|Luban|2018|loc=p.&nbsp;5}}\n\n==== Reception ====\n\nArendt's five-part series \"Eichmann in Jerusalem\" appeared in the ''New Yorker'' in February 1963{{sfn|Arendt|1963}} some nine months after Eichmann was hanged on 31 May 1962. By this time his trial was largely forgotten in the popular mind, superseded by intervening world events.{{sfn|Heller|2015|loc=p.&nbsp;15}} However, no other account of either Eichmann or National Socialism has aroused so much controversy.{{sfn|Stangneth|2014|loc=p.&nbsp;200}} Prior to its publication, Arendt was considered a brilliant humanistic original political thinker.{{sfn|Heller|2015|loc=p.&nbsp;1}} However her mentor, Karl Jaspers, warned her about a possible adverse outcome, \"The Eichmann trial will be no pleasure for you. I'm afraid it cannot go well\".{{efn|Jaspers to Arendt 14 October 1960{{sfn|Arendt|Jaspers|1992|loc=p.&nbsp;267}}}}{{sfn|Heller|2015|loc=p.&nbsp;7}} On publication, three controversies immediately occupied public attention: the concept of Eichmann as banal, her criticism of the role of Israel and her description of the role played by the Jewish people themselves.{{sfn|Heller|2015|loc=pp.&nbsp;15\u201318}}\n\nArendt was profoundly shocked by the response, writing to Karl Jaspers \"People are resorting to any means to destroy my reputation ... They have spent weeks trying to find something in my past that they can hang on me\". Now she was being called arrogant, heartless and ill-informed. She was accused of being duped by Eichmann, of being a \"self-hating Jewess\", and even an enemy of Israel.{{sfn|Maier-Katkin|2010}}{{sfn|Maier-Katkin|2011}}{{sfn|Heller|2015|loc=p.&nbsp;1}} Her critics included [[The Anti-Defamation League]] and many other Jewish groups, editors of publications she was a contributor to, faculty at the universities she taught at and friends from all parts of her life.{{sfn|Heller|2015|loc=p.&nbsp;1}} Her friend Gershom Scholem, a major scholar of [[Kabbalah|Jewish mysticism]], broke off relations with her, publishing their correspondence without her permission.{{sfn|Heller|2015|loc=pp.&nbsp;29\u201331}} Arendt was criticized by many Jewish public figures, who charged her with coldness and lack of sympathy for the victims of the Holocaust. Because of this lingering criticism neither this book nor any of her other works were translated into Hebrew until 1999.{{sfn|Elon|2006a}} Arendt responded to the controversies in the book's Postscript.\n\nAlthough Arendt complained that she was being criticized for telling the truth \u2013 \"what a risky business to tell the truth on a factual level without theoretical and scholarly embroidery\"{{efn|Letter to McCarthy 16 September 1963}}{{sfn|Arendt|McCarthy|1995| loc=p.&nbsp;146}} \u2013 the criticism was largely directed to her theorizing on the nature of mankind and evil and that ordinary people were driven to commit the inexplicable not so much by hatred and ideology as ambition, and inability to empathize. Equally problematic was the suggestion that the victims deceived themselves and complied in their own destruction.{{sfn|Heller|2015|loc=pp.&nbsp;1\u20132}} Prior to Arendt's depiction of Eichmann, his popular image had been, as the ''New York Times'' put it \"the most evil monster of humanity\"{{sfn|NYT|1960}} and as a representative of \"an atrocious crime, unparalleled in history\", \"the extermination of European Jews\".{{sfn|NYT|1960a}} As it turned out Arendt and others were correct in pointing out that Eichmann's characterization by the prosecution as the architect and chief technician of the holocaust was not entirely credible.{{sfn|Heller|2015|loc=p.&nbsp;5}}\n\nRoger Berkowitz states that Arendt neither defended Eichmann, nor denied that his actions were evil and that he was an anti-semite, nor that he should be executed for his actions. But rather that we should understand that those actions were neither monstrous, nor sadistic. In understanding Eichmann, Arendt argues, we come to understand a greater truth about the nature of evil, that individuals participate in atrocities from an inability to critically examine blind allegiance to ideologies that provide a sense of meaning in a lonely and alienating world. Thus, she concludes, thoughtless zealotry is the face of evil in the modern world.{{sfn|Berkowitz|2013}} Nor was Arendt alone in raising concerns about the role played by the ''Judenr\u00e4te''.{{sfn|Wieseltier|1981}}\n\nRejections of Arendt's characterization of Eichmann{{sfn|Walters|2015}} and allegations of racism against her have persisted ever since,{{sfn|Frantzman|2016}} though much of this is based on information that was not available at the time of the trial.{{sfn|Stangneth|2014|loc=p.&nbsp;200}} Issues around factual accuracy have been disputed, as well as whether Eichmann was merely dissembling. [[Irving Howe]], one of her critics, described how the Eichmann issue engendered what approached \"civil war\" amongst New York intellectuals. Howe rightly surmised that \"such controversies are never settled. They die down, simmer, and erupt again\".{{sfn|Howe|2013}} Thus the appearance of the 2012 film ''[[#Hannah Arendt (2012)|Hannah Arendt]]'' reignited the controversy. Berkowitz states that claiming Arendt exonerated Eichmann as simply a man who followed orders, is a misreading of the book. In fact she argued that Eichmann acted equally out of conviction, and even at times disobeyed orders, such as those of [[Himmler]]. Eichmann was, as Berkowitz states, \"someone convinced that he was sacrificing an easy morality for a higher good\".{{sfn|Berkowitz|2013a}}{{sfn|Wolters|2013}} What has emerged following this revisiting of the controversy, is a consensus that whether Arendt was right or wrong about Eichmann, she was correct about the nature of evil,{{sfn|Austerlitz|2013}}{{sfn|Kaplan|2013}}{{sfn|Browning|2013}} in that events of horror can too easily arise from origins that are mundane. Arendt's depiction of the nature of evil has proved both tenacious and timeless in its relevance.{{sfn|Scott|2016}}\n\nWhile much has been made of Arendt's treatment of Eichmann, Ada Ushpiz, in her 2015 documentary ''Vita Activa: The Spirit of Hannah Arendt'',{{sfn|Zeitgeist|2015}} placed it in a much broader context of the use of rationality to explain seemingly irrational historical events.{{efn|The title ''vita activa'' (active life) is taken from Arendt's position in ''The Human Condition''(1958) that thinking is a form of action, and that the active life is as important as the contemplative (''vita contemplativa''){{sfn|Scott|2016}}}}{{sfn|Scott|2016}}\n\n==== {{vanchor|''Niemand hat das Recht zu gehorchen''}} ====\n{{multiple image | header =  Palazzo degli Uffici Finanziari, Bolzano| align = center | direction = horizontal | total_width = 300 | float = none\n|image1=Piffraderrelief Bozen 2017.jpg|caption1 =  |alt1= University of Berlin\n|image2=Fassade finanzamt bozen 2018.jpg|caption2=|alt2=University of Marburg\n|footer= By Day and Night. Fascist monument with Arendt statement over it and explicatory panels in the square in front\n}}\nIn an interview with [[Joachim Fest]] in 1964,{{sfn|Arendt|Fest|1964}} Arendt was asked about Eichmann's defense that he had made Kant's principle of the duty of obedience his guiding principle all his life. Arendt replied that that was outrageous and that Eichmann was misusing Kant, by not considering the element of judgement required in assessing one's own actions \u2013 \"''Kein Mensch hat bei Kant das Recht zu gehorchen''\" (No man has, according to Kant, the right to obey), she stated, paraphrasing Kant. The reference was to Kant's ''[[Die Religion innerhalb der Grenzen der blo\u00dfen Vernunft]]'' (Religion within the Bounds of Bare Reason 1793) in which he states:\n\n<blockquote>''Der Satz 'man mu\u00df Gott mehr gehorchen, als den Menschen' bedeutet nur, da\u00df, wenn die letzten etwas gebieten, was an sich b\u00f6se (dem Sittengesetz unmittelbar zuwider) ist, ihnen nicht gehorcht werden darf und soll''{{sfn|Kant|1793|loc=p.&nbsp;99}} (The saying, \"''We must hearken to God, rather than to man'',\" signifies no more than this, viz. that should any earthly legislation enjoin something immediately contradictory of the moral law, obedience is not to be rendered{{sfn|Kant|1838|loc=p.&nbsp;125}})</blockquote>\n\nKant clearly defines a higher moral duty than rendering merely unto Caesar. Arendt herself had written in her book \"This was outrageous, on the face of it, and also incomprehensible, since Kant's moral philosophy is so closely bound up with man's faculty of judgment, which rules out blind obedience.\"{{sfn|Arendt|2006a|loc=p.&nbsp;135}} Arendt's reply to Fest was subsequently corrupted to read ''Niemand hat das Recht zu gehorchen'' (No one has the right to obey), which has been widely reproduced, although it does encapsulate an aspect of her moral philosophy.{{sfn|Miller|2017}}{{sfn|Krieghofer|2017}}\n\nThe phrase ''Niemand hat das Recht zu gehorchen'' has become one of her iconic images, appearing on the wall of the house in which she was born (''see'' [[#Commemorations|Commemorations]]), among other places.{{sfn|HAT|2018}} A [[fascist]] [[bas-relief]] on the [[Casa del Fascio (Bolzano)|Palazzo degli Uffici Finanziari]] (1942), in the Piazza del Tribunale,{{efn|The Palazzo degli Uffici Finanziari was originally the Casa del Fascio and the square, the Piazza [[Arnaldo Mussolini]], and was erected as the Fascist headquarters for the region.

She wrote:\n\n<blockquote>On top, the judges, the best of German Jewry. Below them, the prosecuting attorneys, [[Galicia (Eastern Europe)|Galicians]], but still Europeans. Everything is organized by a police force that gives me the creeps, speaks only Hebrew, and looks Arabic. Some downright brutal types among them. They would obey any order. And outside the doors, the oriental mob, as if one were in Istanbul or some other half-Asiatic country.{{sfn|Kirsch|2009}}</blockquote>\n\nAlthough Arendt remained a Zionist both during and after World War II, she made it clear that she favored the creation of a Jewish-Arab federated state in Palestine, rather than a purely Jewish state. She believed that this was a way to address Jewish statelessness and to avoid the pitfalls of nationalism.{{sfn|Seliger|2011}}{{sfn|Butler|2007}}\n\nIt was not just Arendt's analysis of the Eichmann trial that drew accusations of racism. In her 1958 essay in ''Dissent'' entitled ''Reflections on Little Rock''{{sfn|Arendt|1959}} she expressed opposition to [[desegregation]] following the 1957 [[Little Rock Integration Crisis]] in Arkansas. As she explains in the preface, for a long time the magazine was reluctant to print her contribution, so far did it appear to differ from the publication's liberal values. Eventually it was printed alongside critical responses. Later the ''[[New Yorker (magazine)|New Yorker]]'' would express similar hesitancy over the Eichmann papers. So vehement was the response, that Arendt felt obliged to defend herself in a sequel.{{sfn|Arendt|1959a}} The debate over this essay has continued since.{{sfn|Morey|2011}} William Simmons devotes a whole section of his 2011 text on [[human rights]] (''Human Rights Law and the Marginalized Other''){{sfn|Simmons|2011}} to a critique of Arendt's position and in particular on Little Rock.{{sfn|Simmons|2011a}} While a number of critics feel she was fundamentally racist,{{sfn|Burroughs|2015}} many of those who have defended Arendt's position have pointed out that her concerns were for the welfare of the children, a position she maintained throughout her life. She felt that the children were being subjected to trauma in order to serve a broader political strategy of forcible integration.{{sfn|Lebeau|2016}} While over time Arendt conceded some ground to her critics, namely that she argued as an outsider, she remained committed to her central critique that children should not be thrust into the front-lines of geopolitical conflict.{{sfn|Pickett|2009}}\n\n=== Feminism ===\n\nEmbraced by [[feminists]] as a pioneer in a world dominated by men up to her time, Arendt did not call herself a feminist and would be very surprised to hear herself described as a feminist,{{sfn|Baier|1995|loc=p.&nbsp;301}}{{sfn|Baier|1998|loc=p.&nbsp;254}} remaining opposed to the social dimensions of [[Women's Liberation]], urging independence, but always keeping in mind ''Viva{{Not a typo}} la petite diff\u00e9rence!''{{sfn|Young-Bruehl|2004|loc=p.&nbsp;238}} On becoming the first woman to be appointed a professor at Princeton in 1953, the media were much engaged in this exceptional achievement, but she never wanted to be seen as an exception, either as a woman (an \"exception woman\"){{sfn|Courtine-Denamy|2000|loc=p.&nbsp;36}} or a Jew, stating emphatically  \"I am not disturbed at all about being a woman professor, because I am quite used to being a woman\".{{sfn|Baier|1998|loc=p.&nbsp;255}} In 1972, discussing women's liberation, she observed \"the real question to ask is, what will we lose if we win?\".{{sfn|Baier|1997|loc=p.&nbsp;332}} She rather enjoyed what she saw as the privileges of being feminine as opposed to feminist, \"Intensly feminine and therefore no feminist\", stated Hans Jonas.{{sfn|Courtine-Denamy|2000|loc=p.&nbsp;36}} Arendt considered some professions and positions unsuitable for women, particularly those involving leadership, telling [[G\u00fcnter Gaus]] \"It just doesn't look good when a woman gives orders\".{{sfn|Courtine-Denamy|2000|loc=p.&nbsp;35}} Despite these views, and having been labelled \"anti-feminist\", much space has been devoted to examining Arendt's place in relation to feminism.{{sfn|Markus|1987}}{{sfn|Honig|2010}} In the last years of her life, [[Virginia Held]] noted that Arendt's views evolved with the emergence of a [[History of feminism|new feminism in America in the 1970s]] to recognize the importance of the women's movement.{{sfn|Held|Kazin|1982}}\n\n=== Critique of human rights ===\n\nIn ''The Origins of Totalitarianism'', Hannah Arendt devotes a lengthy chapter (''The Decline of the Nation-State and the End of the Rights of Man''){{sfn|Arendt|1976|loc=pp.&nbsp;267\u2013302}} to a critical analysis of human rights, in what has been described as \"the most widely read essay on refugees ever published\".{{sfn|Lamey|2011|loc=p.&nbsp;14}} Arendt is not skeptical of the notion of political rights in general, but instead defends a national or civil conception of rights.{{sfn|Arendt|1976|loc=p.&nbsp;389}} Human rights, or the Rights of Man as they were commonly called, are universal, inalienable, and possessed simply by virtue of being human. In contrast, civil rights are possessed by virtue of belonging to a political community, most commonly by being a citizen. Arendt's primary criticism of human rights is that they are ineffectual and illusory because their enforcement is in tension with national sovereignty.{{sfn|Lamey|2011|loc=pp.&nbsp;17\u201319}} She argued that since there is no political authority above that of sovereign nations, state governments have little incentive to respect human rights when such policies conflict with national interests. This can be seen most clearly by examining the treatment of refugees and other stateless people. Since the refugee has no state to secure their civil rights, the only rights they have to fall back on are human rights. In this way Arendt uses the refugee as a test case for examining human rights in isolation from civil rights.{{sfn|Birmingham|2006}}\n\nArendt's analysis draws on the refugee upheavals in the first half of the twentieth century along with her own experience as a refugee fleeing Nazi Germany. She argued that as state governments began to emphasize national identity as a prerequisite for full legal status, the number of minority resident aliens increased along with the number of stateless persons whom no state was willing to recognize legally.{{sfn|Arendt|1976|loc=p.&nbsp;379\u2013381}} The two potential solutions to the refugee problem, repatriation and naturalization, both proved incapable of solving the crisis. Arendt argued that repatriation failed to solve the refugee crisis because no government was willing to take them in and claim them as their own. When refugees were forcibly deported to neighboring countries, such immigration was deemed illegal by the receiving country, and so failed to change the fundamental status of the migrants as stateless. Attempts at naturalizing and assimilating refugees also had little success. This failure was primarily the result of resistance from both state governments and the majority of citizens, since both tended to see the refugees as undesirables who threatened their national identity. Resistance to naturalization also came from the refugees themselves who resisted assimilation and attempted to maintain their own ethnic and national identities.{{sfn|Arendt|1976|loc=p.&nbsp;378\u2013384}} Arendt contends that neither naturalization nor the tradition of asylum was capable of handling the sheer number of refugees. Instead of accepting some refugees with legal status, the state often responded by denaturalizing minorities who shared national or ethnic ties with stateless refugees.{{sfn|Birmingham|2006}}\n\nArendt argues that the consistent mistreatment of refugees, most of whom were placed in internment camps, is evidence against the existence of human rights. If the notion of human rights as universal and inalienable is to be taken seriously, the rights must be realizable given the features of the modern liberal state.{{sfn|Lamey|2011|loc=pp.&nbsp;27\u201329}} She concluded \"The Rights of Man, supposedly inalienable, proved to be unenforceable\u2013even in countries whose constitutions were based upon them\u2013whenever people appeared who were no longer citizens of any sovereign state\".{{sfn|Arendt|1976|loc=p.&nbsp;293}} Arendt contends that they are not realizable because they are in tension with at least one feature of the liberal state\u2014national sovereignty. One of the primary ways in which a nation exercises sovereignty is through control over national borders. State governments consistently grant their citizens free movement to traverse national borders. In contrast, the movement of refugees is often restricted in the name of national interests.{{sfn|Lamey|2011|loc=pp.&nbsp;239\u2013240}} This restriction presents a dilemma for liberalism because liberal theorists typically are committed to both human rights and the existence of sovereign nations.{{sfn|Birmingham|2006}}\n\nIn one of her most quoted passages,{{sfn|Lamey|2011|loc=p.&nbsp;18}} she puts forward the concept that human rights are little more than an abstraction:\n\n<blockquote>The conception of human rights based upon the assumed existence of a human being as such broke down at the very moment when those who professed to believe in it were for the first time confronted with people who had indeed lost all other qualities and specific relationships - except that they were still human. The world found nothing sacred in the abstract nakedness of being human.{{sfn|Arendt|1976|loc=p.&nbsp;299}}</blockquote>\n\n== In popular culture ==\n\nSeveral authors have written biographies that focus on the relationship between Hannah Arendt and Martin Heidegger.{{sfn|Ettinger|1997}}{{sfn|Grunenberg|2017}}{{sfn|Maier-Katkin|2010a}} In 1999, the French feminist philosopher [[Catherine Cl\u00e9ment]] wrote a novel, ''Martin and Hannah'',{{sfn|Cl\u00e9ment|2001}} speculating on the triangular relationship between Heidegger and the two women in his life, Arendt and Heidegger's wife Elfriede Petri. In addition to the relationships, the novel is a serious exploration of philosophical ideas, that centers on Arendt's last meeting with Heidegger in Freiburg in 1975. The scene is based on Elisabeth Young-Bruehl's description in ''Hannah Arendt: For Love of the World'' (1982),{{sfn|Young-Bruehl|2004}} but reaches back to their childhoods, and Heidegger's role in encouraging the relationship between the two women.{{sfn|Kristeva|2001}} The novel explores Heidegger's embrace of Nazism as a proxy for that of Germany and, as in Arendt's treatment of Eichmann, the difficult relationship between collective guilt and personal responsibility. Cl\u00e9ment also brings Hannah's other mentor and confidante, Karl Jaspers, into the matrix of relationships.{{sfn|Schroeder|2002}}\n\nHannah Arendt - and parts of her life before America - appears as the appropriately named Athena at the end of Book II and particularly in Chapters 9-11 (Berlin, Dresden, 1933) and Chapter 49 (Montauban, 1940) in Book III of the series of novels 'In the Shadow of the Fallen'.\n\n=== {{vanchor|''Hannah Arendt'' (2012)}} ===\n{{main|Hannah Arendt (film)}}\nArendt's life remains part of current culture and thought. In 2012 the German film, ''Hannah Arendt'', directed by [[Margarethe von Trotta]] was released. The film, with [[Barbara Sukowa]] in the title role, depicted the controversy over Arendt's coverage of the Eichmann trial and subsequent book,{{sfn|Arendt|2006a}} in which she was widely misunderstood as defending Eichmann and blaming Jewish leaders for the Holocaust.{{sfn|BBFC|2018}}{{sfn|IMDb|2012}}\n\n== Legacy ==\n[[File:Hannah-Arendt-Strasse-Berlin.jpg|thumb|upright|Hannah-Arendt Stra\u00dfe in Berlin]]\nHannah Arendt is widely considered one of the most influential political philosophers of the twentieth century.{{sfn|d'Entreves|2014}} As a political theorist, moral philosopher and polemicist, she is unmatched in both range and rigor.{{sfn|Scott|2016}} In 1998 [[Walter Laqueur]] stated \"No twentieth-century philosopher and political thinker has at the present time as wide an echo\", as philosopher, historian, sociologist and also journalist.{{sfn|Laqueur|1998}} In popular imagination she is known primarily for the reaction to her work on Adolf Eichmann, and in particular for the one phrase \"the banality of evil\".{{sfn|Scott|2016}} Arendt's legacy has been described as a cult,{{sfn|Laqueur|1998}}{{sfn|Shenhav|2007}} yet she shunned publicity, never expecting, as she explained to Karl Jaspers in 1951, to see herself as a \"cover girl\" on the newsstands.{{efn|Letter to Jaspers 14 May 1951.{{sfn|Arendt|Jaspers|1992|loc=p.&nbsp;170}} Her image appeared on the cover of the ''[[Saturday Review of Literature]]'' on Saturday, 24 March 1951 (''see [[#SRL|image]]''), shortly after the publication of ''The Origins of Totalitarianism''. She also appeared on ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' and ''[[Newsweek]]'' in the same week{{sfn|Ring|1998|loc=p.&nbsp;106}}}}{{sfn|Young-Bruehl|2004|loc=p.&nbsp;xxxviii}} In Germany, there are tours available of sites associated with her life.{{sfn|Kulturreise|2018}}\n\nThe study of the life and work of Hannah Arendt, and of her political and philosophical theory is described as [[:wikt:Arendtian|Arendtian]].{{sfn|HAC Verona|2018 }}{{sfn|Canovan|2013}} In her will she established the Hannah Arendt Bluecher Literary Trust as the custodian of her writings and photographs.{{sfn|Kohn|2018}} Her personal library was deposited at Bard College at the Stevenson Library in 1976, and includes approximately 4,000 books, [[ephemera]], and pamphlets from Arendt's last apartment as well as her desk (in McCarthy House).{{sfn|About HAC Bard|2018}} The college has begun archiving some of the collection digitally, which is available at The Hannah Arendt Collection.{{sfn|Bard|2018}} Most of her papers were deposited at the [[Library of Congress]] and her correspondence with her German friends and mentors, such as Heidegger, Blumenfeld and Jaspers, at the [[:de:Deutsches Literaturarchiv Marbach|Deutsches Literaturarchiv]] in Marbach.{{sfn|Young-Bruehl|2004|loc=p.&nbsp;xlvii}} The Library of Congress listed more than 50 books written about her in 1998, and that number has continued to grow, as have the number of scholarly articles, estimated as 1000 at that time.{{sfn|Laqueur|1998}}\n\nHer life and work is recognized by the institutions most closely associated with her teaching, by the creation of Hannah Arendt Centers at both Bard (Hannah Arendt Center for Politics and Humanities){{sfn|HAC Bard|2018}} and The New School,{{sfn|Bernstein|2017}} both in New York State. In Germany, her contributions to understanding [[authoritarianism]] is recognised by the Hannah-Arendt-Institut f\u00fcr Totalitarismusforschung ([[Hannah Arendt Institute for the Research on Totalitarianism]]) in [[Dresden]]. There are Hannah Arendt Associations (Hannah Arendt Verein){{sfn|Laqueur|1998}} such as the Hannah Arendt Verein f\u00fcr politisches Denken in [[Bremen]] that awards the annual Hannah-Arendt-Preis f\u00fcr politisches Denken ([[Hannah Arendt Prize for Political Thinking]]) established in 1995. In [[Oldenburg]], the Hannah Arendt Center at [[Carl von Ossietzky University]] was established in 1999,{{sfn|HAC Oldenburg|2018}} and holds a large collection of her work (Hannah Arendt Archiv),{{sfn|HAArchiv|2018}} and administers the [[internet portal]] ''HannahArendt.net'' (A Journal for Political Thinking){{sfn|Heuer|2018}} as well as a monograph series, the ''Hannah Arendt-Studien''.{{sfn|Grunenberg|2018}} In Italy, the Hannah Arendt Center for Political Studies is situated at the [[University of Verona]] for Arendtian studies.{{sfn|HAC Verona|2018 }}\n\nIn 2017 a journal, ''Arendt Studies'', was launched to publish articles related to the study of the life, work, and legacy of Hannah Arendt.{{sfn|Barry|2017}} Many places associated with her, have memorabilia of her on display, such as her student card at the University of Heidelberg (''see image'').{{sfn|UHeidelberg|2015}} 2006, the anniversary of her birth, saw commemorations of her work in conferences and celebrations around the world.{{sfn|Villa|2009}}\n\nIn 2015, the filmmaker Ada Ushpiz produced a documentary on Hannah Arendt, ''Vita Activa: The Spirit of Hannah Arendt''.{{sfn|Zeitgeist|2015}} The ''New York Times'' designated it a New York Times critics pick.{{sfn|Scott|2016}} Of the many photographic portraits of Arendt, that taken in 1944 by [[Fred Stein]] (''see [[#Stein44|image]]''), whose work she greatly admired,{{efn|Arendt wrote to Stein \"It is my honest opinion that you are one of the best portrait photographers of the present day\"{{sfn|AIE|2018}}}} has become iconic, and has been described as better known than the photographer himself,{{sfn|Heinrich|2013}} having appeared on a German postage stamp.(''see [[#UNHCRStamp|image]]'') Among organizations that have recognized Arendt's contributions to civilization and human rights, is the [[United Nations Refugee Agency]] (UNHCR).{{sfn|UNHCR|2017}}\n\n=== Contemporary interest ===\n[[File:2014-08 Graffiti Patrik Wolters alias BeneR1 im Team mit Kevin Lasner alias koarts, Hannah Arendt-Haus am Lindener Marktplatz 2, Hannover-Linden-Mitte, Blick durch die Seiteneinfahrt in der Falkenstra\u00dfe.jpg|thumb|upright|Courtyard of Arendt's house in Linden-Mitte|alt=Photograph of the courtyard of the house in which she was born, showing Hannah with a cigarette in her hand and the inscription, attributed to her \"No one has the right to obey\", in German]]\nThe rise of [[nativism (politics)|nativism]], such as the election of [[Donald Trump]] in America,{{sfn|DP|2017}}{{sfn|Hill|2017}}{{sfn|Scroll|2017}} and concerns regarding an increasingly authoritarian style of governance has led to a surge of interest in Arendt and her writings, including{{sfn|Bernstein|2018}} radio broadcasts{{sfn|Bragg et al|2017}} and writers, including [[Jeremy Adelman]]{{sfn|Adelman|2016}} and Zoe Williams,{{sfn|Williams|2017}} to revisit Arendt's ideas to seek the extent to which they inform our understanding of such movements,{{sfn|Grenier|2017}}{{sfn|Coombes|2017|}} which are being described as \"Dark Times\".{{sfn|Bernstein|2018b}} At the same time [[Amazon (company)|Amazon]] reported that it had sold out of copies of ''The Origins of Totalitarianism'' (1951).{{sfn|Gold|2017}} [[Michiko Kakutani]] has addressed what she refers to as \"The Death of Truth\".{{sfn|Kakutani|2018}} In her book, she argues that the rise of totalitarianism has been founded on the violation of truth. She begins her book with an extensive quote from ''The Origins of Totalitarianism'':{{sfn|Arendt|1976}}\n\n<blockquote>The ideal subject of totalitarian rule is not the convinced Nazi or the convinced communist, but people for whom the distinction between fact and fiction (i.e., the reality of experience) and the distinction between true and false (i.e., the standards of thought) no longer exist{{sfn|Arendt|1976|loc=p.&nbsp;474}}{{sfn|Kakutani|2018|loc=p.&nbsp;1}}</blockquote>\n\nKakutani and others believed that Arendt's words speak not just events of a previous century but apply equally to the contemporary cultural landscape{{sfn|Bernstein|2018a}} populated with [[fake news]] and lies. She also draws on Arendt's essay \"Lying in Politics\" from ''Crises in the Republic''{{sfn|Arendt|1972}} pointing to the lines:\n\n<blockquote>The historian knows how vulnerable is the whole texture of facts in which we spend our daily life; it is always in danger of being perforated by single lies or torn to shreds by the organized lying of groups, nations, or classes, or denied and distorted, often carefully covered up by reams of falsehoods or simply allowed to fall into oblivion. Facts need testimony to be remembered and trustworthy witnesses to be established in order to find a secure dwelling place in the domain of human affairs{{sfn|Arendt|1972|loc=p.&nbsp;6}}</blockquote>\n\nArendt drew attention to the critical role that [[propaganda]] plays in [[gaslighting]] populations, Kakutani observes, citing the passage:{{sfn|Hayes|2018}}{{sfn|Kakutani|2018a}}\n\n<blockquote>In an ever-changing, incomprehensible world the masses had reached the point where they would, at the same time, believe everything and nothing, think that everything was possible and that nothing was true . ... The totalitarian mass leaders based their propaganda on the correct psychological assumption that, under such conditions, one could make people believe the most fantastic statements one day, and trust that if the next day they were given irrefutable proof of their falsehood, they would take refuge in cynicism; instead of deserting the leaders who had lied to them, they would protest that they had known all along that the statement was a lie and would admire the leaders for their superior tactical cleverness{{sfn|Arendt|1976|loc=p.&nbsp;382}}</blockquote>\n\nBut it is also relevant that Arendt took a broader perspective on history than merely totalitarianism in the early twentieth century, stating \"the deliberate falsehood and the outright lie have been used as legitimate means to achieve political ends since the beginning of recorded history\".{{sfn|Arendt|1972|loc=p.&nbsp;4}}{{sfn|Hanlon|2018}} Contemporary relevance is also reflected in the increasing use of the phrase, attributed to her, \"[[#Niemand hat das Recht zu gehorchen|No one has the right to obey]]\" to reflect that actions result from choices, and hence judgement, and that we cannot disclaim responsibility for that which we have the power to act upon.{{sfn|Invernizzi-Accetti|2017}} In addition those centers established to promote Arendtian studies continue to seek solutions to a wide range of contemporary issues in her writing.{{sfn|HAC|2018}}\n\nArendt's teachings on obedience have also been linked to the controversial psychology experiments by [[Stanley Milgram]], that implied that ordinary people can easily be induced to commit atrocities.{{sfn|Oatley|2018|loc=p.&nbsp;254}}{{sfn|Wolters|2013}} Milgram himself drew attention to this in 1974, stating that he was testing the theory that Eichmann like others would merely follow orders, but unlike Milgram she argued that actions involve responsibility.{{sfn|Milgram|2017|loc=p.&nbsp;23}}{{sfn|Berkowitz|2013a}}\n\nArendt's theories on the political consequences of how nations deal with refugees has remained relevant and compelling. Arendt had observed first hand the displacement of large stateless and rightsless populations, treated not so much as people in need than as problems to solve, and in many cases, resist.{{sfn|Scott|2016}} She wrote about this in her 1943 essay \"We refugees\".{{sfn|Arendt|1943}}{{sfn|Bhabha|Weigel|2018}} Another Arendtian theme that finds an echo in contemporary society is her observation, inspired by Rilke, of the despair of not being heard, the futility of tragedy that finds no listener that can bring comfort, assurance and intervention. An example of this being gun violence in America and the resulting political inaction.{{sfn|Hill|2015}}\n\n''In Search of the Last Agora'', an illustrated [[documentary film]] by Lebanese director Rayyan Dabbous about Hannah Arendt's 1958 work ''The Human Condition'', was released in 2018 to mark the book's 50th anniversary. Screened at Bard College, the experimental film is described as finding \"new meaning in the political theorist's conceptions of politics, technology and society in the 1950s\", particularly in her prediction of abuses of phenomena unknown in Arendt's time, including social media, intense globalization, and obsessive celebrity culture.{{sfn|Bard News|2018}}\n\n=== {{vanchor|Commemorations}} ===\n{{main|List of memorials to Hannah Arendt}}\nHannah Arendt's life and work continue to be commemorated in many different ways, including plaques (''Gedenktafeln'') indicating places she has lived.

Her many books and articles on topics ranging from [[totalitarianism]] to [[epistemology]] have had a lasting influence on political theory. Arendt is widely considered one of the most important political philosophers of the twentieth century.\n\nArendt was born in [[Hanover]], Germany but mostly raised in [[K\u00f6nigsberg]] in a secular merchant Jewish culture by parents who were politically progressive, being supporters of the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|Social Democrats]]. Her father died when she was seven, so she was raised by her mother and grandfather. After completing her secondary education, she studied at the [[University of Marburg]] under [[Martin Heidegger]], with whom she had a brief affair, and who had a lasting influence on her thinking. She obtained her doctorate in philosophy in 1929 at the [[University of Heidelberg]] with [[Karl Jaspers]].\n\nHannah Arendt married [[G\u00fcnther Stern]] in 1929, but soon began to encounter increasing [[antisemitism]] in 1930s [[Nazi Germany]]. [[Adolf Hitler]] came to power in 1933, and while researching antisemitic propaganda for the [[Zionist Federation of Germany]] in Berlin that year, Arendt was denounced and briefly imprisoned by the [[Gestapo]]. On release, she fled Germany, living in Czechoslovakia and Switzerland before settling in Paris. There she worked for [[Youth Aliyah]], assisting young Jews to emigrate to [[Mandatory Palestine|Palestine]]. Divorcing Stern in 1937, she married [[Heinrich Bl\u00fccher]] in 1940, but when Germany invaded France in 1940 she was detained by the French as an alien, despite having been stripped of her German citizenship in 1937. She escaped and made her way to the United States in 1941 via Portugal. She settled in New York, which remained her principal residence for the rest of her life. She became a writer and editor and worked for the [[Jewish Cultural Reconstruction]], becoming an American citizen in 1950. With the publication of ''[[The Origins of Totalitarianism]]'' in 1951, her reputation as a thinker and writer was established and a series of seminal works followed. These included ''[[The Human Condition (book)|The Human Condition]]'' in 1958, as well as ''[[Eichmann in Jerusalem]]'' and ''[[On Revolution]]'' in 1963. She taught at many American universities, while declining [[tenure-track]] appointments. She died suddenly of a [[Myocardial infarction|heart attack]] in 1975, at the age of 69, leaving her last work, ''[[The Life of the Mind]]'', unfinished.\n\nHer works cover a broad range of topics, but she is best known for those dealing with the nature of [[power (sociology)|power]] and [[evil]], as well as politics, [[direct democracy]], [[authority]], and totalitarianism. In the popular mind she is best remembered for the controversy surrounding the trial of [[Adolf Eichmann]], her attempt to explain how ordinary people become actors in totalitarian systems, which was considered by some an [[apologia]], and for the phrase \"[[the banality of evil]]\". She is commemorated by institutions and journals devoted to her thinking, the [[Hannah Arendt Prize]] for political thinking, and on stamps, street names and schools, amongst other things.{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n== Early life and education (1906\u20131929) ==\n=== Family of origin ===\n{{multiple image | header = Parents | align = right | direction = horizontal | total_width = 250 | float = none\n|image1=Martha Cohn.jpg|caption1 = Martha Cohn ca. 1899|alt1= Photo of Hannah's mother, Martha Cohn, in 1899\n|image2=Paul Arendt.jpg|caption2= Paul Arendt ca. 1900|alt2=Photo of Hannah's father, Paul Arendt, in 1900\n}}\nHannah Arendt was born Johanna Cohn Arendt{{sfn|Wood|2004}}{{sfn|LoC|2001}} in 1906 into a comfortable educated secular family of German Jews in [[Linden-Limmer|Linden]], [[Prussia]] (now a part of [[Hanover]]), in [[Wilhelmine Germany]]. Her family were merchants of Russian extraction from [[K\u00f6nigsberg]],{{efn|After [[World War II]] K\u00f6nigsberg became [[Kaliningrad]], Russia }} the [[East Prussia]]n capital. Arendt's grandparents were members of the [[Reform Jewish]] community there. Hannah's paternal grandfather, {{ill|Max Arendt|de}} (1843\u20131913), was a prominent businessman, local politician,{{sfn|Heller|2015|loc=pp.&nbsp;33\u201334}} one of the leaders of the K\u00f6nigsberg Jewish community and a member of the [[Centralverein deutscher Staatsb\u00fcrger j\u00fcdischen Glaubens]] (Central Organization for German Citizens of the Jewish Faith). Like other members of the Centralverein he primarily saw himself as a German and disapproved of the activities of [[Zionism|Zionists]], such as the young [[Kurt Blumenfeld]] (1884\u20131963), who was a frequent visitor to their home and would later become one of Hannah's mentors. Of Max Arendt's children, Paul Arendt (1873\u20131913) was an engineer and [[Henriette Arendt]] (1874\u20131922) was a policewoman who became a social worker.{{sfn|Riepl-Schmidt|2005}}{{sfn|Young-Bruehl|2004|loc=pp.&nbsp;8\u20139}}\n\nHannah was the only child of Paul and Martha (born Cohn) Arendt (1874\u20131948),{{sfn|Geni|2018}} who were married on 11 April 1902. She was named after her paternal grandmother.{{sfn|Young-Bruehl|2004|loc=p.&nbsp;17}}{{sfn|McGowan|1998}} The Cohns had originally come to K\u00f6nigsberg from nearby Russian territory (now [[Lithuania]]) in 1852, as refugees from anti-Semitism, and made their living as tea importers; J. N. Cohn & Company became the largest business in the city. The Arendts had reached Germany from Russia a century earlier.{{sfn|Gould|2009|loc=p.&nbsp;65}}{{sfn|Young-Bruehl|2004|loc=pp.&nbsp;5\u20137}}  Hannah's extended family contained many more women, who shared the loss of husbands and children. Hannah's parents were better educated and politically more to the left than her grandparents, both being members of the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|Social Democrats]], {{sfn|Wood|2004}} rather than the [[German Democratic Party]] that most of their contemporaries supported. Paul Arendt was educated at the Albertina ([[University of K\u00f6nigsberg]]). Though he worked as an engineer, he prided himself on his love of [[Classics]]. He collected a large library, in which Hannah immersed herself. Martha Cohn, a musician, had studied for three years in Paris.{{sfn|Young-Bruehl|2004|loc=pp.&nbsp;8\u20139}}\n\nIn the first four years of their marriage, the Arendts lived in Berlin, where they were supporters of the socialist journal ''[[Sozialistische Monatshefte]]''.{{efn|''Sozialistische Monatshefte'' was edited by the K\u00f6nigsberg Jewish scholar, [[:de:Joseph Bloch|Joseph Bloch]], and formed the focal point of Martha Arendt's K\u00f6nigsberg socialist discussion group}}{{sfn|Young-Bruehl|2004|loc=p.&nbsp;27}} At the time of Hannah's birth, Paul Arendt was employed by an electrical engineering firm in Linden, and they lived in a frame house on the market square (Marktplatz).{{sfn|Young-Bruehl|2004|loc=p.&nbsp;13}} The Arendt family moved back to K\u00f6nigsberg in 1909, because of Paul's deteriorating health.{{sfn|Young-Bruehl|2004|loc=p.&nbsp;5}}{{sfn|Yar|2018}} Hannah's father suffered from a prolonged illness with [[syphilis]] and had to be institutionalized in the K\u00f6nigsberg psychiatric hospital in 1911. For years later, Hannah had to have annual [[Wassermann test|WR]] tests for congenital syphilis.{{sfn|Young-Bruehl|2004|loc=p.&nbsp;22}} He died on 30 October 1913, when Hannah was seven, leaving her mother to raise her.{{sfn|Young-Bruehl|2004|loc=p.&nbsp;17}}{{sfn|Berkowitz|2013}} They lived at Hannah's grandfather's house at Tiergartenstrasse 6, a leafy residential street adjacent to the [[K\u00f6nigsberg Tiergarten]], in the predominantly Jewish neighborhood of [[Hufen]].{{sfn|Young-Bruehl|2004|loc=pp.&nbsp;10,16,26}} Although Hannah's parents were non-religious, they were happy to allow Max Arendt to take Hannah to the Reform [[synagogue]]. She also received religious instruction from the [[rabbi]], Hermann Vogelstein, who would come to her school for that purpose. At the time the young Hannah confided that she wished to marry him when she grew up.{{sfn|Young-Bruehl|2004|loc=pp.&nbsp;8\u20139}} Her family moved in circles that included many intellectuals and professionals. It was a social circle of high standards and ideals. As she recalled it:\n\n<blockquote>My early intellectual formation occurred in an atmosphere where nobody paid much attention to moral questions; we were brought up under the assumption: ''Das Moralische versteht sich von selbst'', moral conduct is a matter of course.{{sfn|Arendt|1964|loc=p.&nbsp;6}}</blockquote>\n\n{{multiple image | header = The Arendt Family | align = center | direction = horizontal | total_width = 800 | float = none\n|image1=Hannah and Max Arendt (cropped).jpg|caption1 = Hannah Arendt with her grandfather, Max, in 1907|alt1= Photo of Hannah's grandfather, Max Arendt holding Hannah.

There he started writing using the ''[[nom-de-plume]]'' of G\u00fcnther Anders, i.e. \"G\u00fcnther Other\".{{efn|''Anders'' - there are a number of theories as to reason why, including Herbert Ihering stating there were too many writers called Stern, so choose something \"different\" (''anders''), to being less Jewish sounding,{{sfn|Dries|2018}} to not wanting to be seen as the son of his famous father{{sfn|Jonas|2006}}}}{{sfn|Dries|2018}} Arendt assisted G\u00fcnther with his work, but the shadow of Heidegger hung over their relationship. While G\u00fcnther was working on his ''Habilitationsschrift'', Arendt had abandoned the original subject of German Romanticism for her thesis in 1930, and turned instead to Rahel Varnhagen and the question of assimilation.{{sfn|Young-Bruehl|2004|loc=p.&nbsp;85}}{{sfn|Zebad\u00faa Y\u00e1\u00f1ez|2017}} Anne Mendelssohn had accidentally acquired a copy of Varhagen's correspondence and excitedly introduced her to Arendt, donating her collection to her. A little later, Arendt's own work on romanticism led her to a study of Jewish [[salon (gathering)|salons]] and eventually to those of Varnhagen. In Rahel, she found qualities she felt reflected her own, particularly those of sensibility and vulnerability.{{sfn|Young-Bruehl|2004|loc=p.&nbsp;56}} Rahel, like Hannah, found her destiny in her Jewishness. Hannah Arendt would come to call Rahel Varnhagen's discovery of living with her destiny as being a \"conscious pariah\".{{sfn|Young-Bruehl|2004|loc=p.&nbsp;38}} This was a personal trait that Arendt had recognized in herself, although she did not embrace the term until later.{{sfn|Young-Bruehl|2004|loc=p.&nbsp;39}}\n\nBack in Berlin, Arendt found herself becoming more involved in politics and started studying political theory, and reading [[Marx]] and [[Trotsky]], while developing contacts at the [[Deutsche Hochschule f\u00fcr Politik]].{{sfn|Young-Bruehl|2004|loc=p.&nbsp;92}} Despite the political leanings of her mother and husband she never saw herself as a political leftist, justifying her activism as being through her Jewishness.{{sfn|Young-Bruehl|2004|loc=pp.&nbsp;104\u2013105}} Her increasing interest in Jewish politics and her examination of assimilation in her study of Varnhagen led her to publish her first article on [[Judaism]], ''[[:de:Aufkl\u00e4rung und Judenfrage|Aufkl\u00e4rung und Judenfrage]]'' (\"The Enlightenment and the Jewish Question\", 1932).{{sfn|Arendt-Stern|1932}}{{sfn|Young-Bruehl|2004|loc=p.&nbsp;93}} Blumenfeld had introduced her to the \"[[Jewish question]]\", which would be his lifelong concern.{{sfn|Young-Bruehl|2004|loc=p.&nbsp;xxxix}} Meanwhile, her views on German Romanticism were evolving. She wrote a review of [[:de:Hans Weil|Hans Weil]]'s ''Die Entstehung des deutschen Bildungsprinzips'' (''The Origin of German Educational Principle'', 1930),{{sfn|Weil|1967}} which dealt with the emergence of ''[[:de:Bildungselite|Bildungselite]]'' (educational elite) in the time of Rahel Varnhagen.{{sfn|Arendt|1931}} At the same time she began to be occupied by [[Max Weber]]'s description of the status of Jewish people within a state as ''pariavolk'' ([[outcast (person)|pariah]] people) in his ''[[Wirtschaft und Gesellschaft]]'' (1922),{{sfn|Weber|1978|loc=p.&nbsp;493''ff''}}{{sfn|Swedberg|Agevall|2016|loc=p.&nbsp;245\u2013246}} while borrowing [[Bernard Lazare]]'s term ''paria conscient'' (conscious pariah){{sfn|Lazare|2016|loc=p.&nbsp;8}} with which she identified.{{efn|''Pariavolk'': In ''Religionssoziologie'' (The Sociology of Religion).

Eine psychologische Bilanz'' (Contemporary Women's Issues: A psychological balance sheet).{{sfn|R\u00fchle-Gerstel|1932}} Although not a supporter of the women's movement, the review was sympathetic. At least in terms of the status of women at that time, she was skeptical of the movement's ability to achieve political change.{{sfn|Bagchi|2007}} She was also critical of the movement, because it ''was'' a women's movement, rather than contributing with men to a political movement, abstract rather than striving for concrete goals. In this manner she echoed Rosa Luxemburg. Like Luxemburg, she would later criticize Jewish movements for the same reason. Arendt consistently prioritized political over social questions.{{sfn|Young-Bruehl|2004|loc=pp.&nbsp;95\u201397}}\n\nBy 1932, faced with a deteriorating political situation, Arendt was deeply troubled by reports that Heidegger was speaking at [[National Socialist]] meetings. She wrote, asking him to deny that he was attracted to National Socialism. Heidegger replied that he did not seek to deny the rumors (which were true), and merely assured her that his feelings for her were unchanged.{{sfn|Kirsch|2009}} As a Jew in Nazi Germany, Arendt was prevented from making a living and discriminated against and confided to Anne Mendelssohn that emigration was probably inevitable. Jaspers had tried to persuade her to consider herself as a German first, a position she distanced herself from, pointing out that she was a Jew and that \"''F\u00fcr mich ist Deutschland die Muttersprache, die Philosophie und die Dichtung''\" (For me, Germany is the mother tongue, philosophy and poetry), rather than her identity. This position puzzled Jaspers, replying \"It is strange to me that as a Jew you want to be different from the Germans\".{{sfn|Arendt|Jaspers|1992|loc=pp.&nbsp;52ff}}\n\nBy 1933, life for the Jewish population in Germany was becoming precarious. [[Adolf Hitler]] became [[Chancellor of Germany|''Reichskanzler'' (Chancellor)]] in January, and the [[Reichstag fire|Reichstag was burned down]] (''Reichstagsbrand'') the following month. This led to the suspension of [[civil liberties]], with attacks on the left, and, in particular, members of the [[Kommunistische Partei Deutschlands]] (German Communist Party: KPD). Stern, who had communist associations, fled to Paris, but Arendt stayed on to become an activist. Knowing her time was limited, she used the apartment at Opitzstrasse 6 in [[Berlin-Steglitz]] that she had occupied with Stern since 1932 as an underground railway way-station for fugitives. Her rescue operation there is now recognized with a plaque on the wall (''see image'').{{sfn|Heller|2015|loc=pp.&nbsp;62\u201364}}{{sfn|Young-Bruehl|2004|loc=pp.&nbsp;102\u2013104}} \n[[File:Gedenktafel Opitzstr 6 (Stegl) Hannah Arendt.JPG|thumb|upright|Memorial at Opitzstrasse 6|alt=Plaque on the wall at Hannah's apartment building on Opitzstrasse, commemorating her]]\n[[File:Bundesarchiv B 145 Bild-P014772, Berlin, Staatsbibliothek, Unter den Linden.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Prussian State Library]]|alt=Photo of exterior of Prussian State Library in 1938]] \nArendt had already positioned herself as a critic of the rising Nazi Party in 1932 by publishing \"''Adam-M\u00fcller-Renaissance?''\"{{sfn|Arendt|1932b}} a critique of the appropriation of the life of [[Adam M\u00fcller]] to support right wing ideology. The beginnings of anti-Jewish laws and boycott came in the spring of 1933.

Not as a German, not as a world citizen, not as an upholder of the Rights of Man.\"{{sfn|Arendt|1964}}{{sfn|Villa|2009}} This was Arendt's introduction of the concept of Jew as Pariah that would occupy her for the rest of her life in her Jewish writings.{{sfn|Grunenberg|2017|loc=p.&nbsp;133}} She took a public position by publishing part of her largely completed biography of Rahel Varnhagen as \"''Originale Assimilation: Ein Nachwort zu Rahel Varnhagen 100 Todestag''\" (\"Original Assimilation: An Epilogue to the One Hundredth Anniversary of Rahel Varnhagen's Death\") in the ''[[:de:K\u00f6lnische Zeitung|K\u00f6lnische Zeitung]]'' on 7 March 1933 and a little later also in ''[[:de:J\u00fcdische Rundschau|J\u00fcdische Rundschau]]''.{{efn|\"Original Assimilation\" was first published in English in 2007, as part of the collection ''Jewish Writings''.{{sfn|Arendt|2009a|loc=pp.&nbsp;22\u201328}}}}{{sfn|Saussy|2013}} In the article she argues that the age of assimilation that began with Varnhagen's generation had come to an end with an official state policy of antisemitism.

Arendt had access to the [[Prussian State Library]] for her work on Varnhagen. Blumenfeld's Zionistische Vereinigung f\u00fcr Deutschland ([[Zionist Federation of Germany]]) persuaded her to use this access to obtain evidence of the extent of antisemitism, for a planned speech to the [[Zionist Congress]] in Prague. This research was illegal at the time.{{sfn|Heller|2015|loc=p.&nbsp;63}} Her actions led to her being denounced by a librarian for anti-state propaganda, resulting in the arrest of both Arendt and her mother by the ''[[Gestapo]]''.

The women were gathered together in the [[V\u00e9lodrome d'Hiver]] on 15 May, so Hannah Arendt's mother, being over 55, was allowed to stay in Paris.

Since her death, her correspondences with many of them have been published, revealing much information about her thinking. To her friends she was both loyal and generous, dedicating a number of her works to them.{{sfn|Young-Bruehl|2004|loc=p.&nbsp;xl}} ''Freundschaft'' (friendship) she described as being one of \"''t\u00e4tigen Modi des Lebendigseins''\" (the active modes of being alive),{{sfn|Berkowitz|Storey|2017|loc=p.&nbsp;107}} and, to her, friendship was central both to her life and to the concept of politics.{{sfn|Nixon|2015|loc=p.&nbsp;viii}}{{sfn|Young-Bruehl|2004|loc=p.&nbsp;xl}} Hans Jonas described her as having a \"genius for friendship\", and, in her own words, \"''der Eros der Freundschaft''\" (love of friendship).{{sfn|Weyembergh|1999|loc=p.&nbsp;94}}{{sfn|Young-Bruehl|2004|loc=p.&nbsp;xl}}\n\nHer philosophy-based friendships were male and European, while her later American friendships were more diverse, literary, and political. Although she became an American citizen in 1950, her cultural roots remained European, and her language remained her German \"''Muttersprache''\".{{sfn|Arendt|Gaus|1964}} She surrounded herself with German-speaking ''\u00e9migr\u00e9s'', sometimes referred to as \"The Tribe\". To her, ''wirkliche Menschen'' (real people) were \"pariahs\", not in the sense of outcasts, but in the sense of outsiders, unassimilated, with the virtue of \"social nonconformism ... the ''sine qua non'' of intellectual achievement\", a sentiment she shared with Jaspers.{{sfn|Young-Bruehl|2004|loc=pp.&nbsp;xli\u2013xliv}}\n\nArendt always had a ''beste Freundin''. In her teens she had formed a lifelong relationship with her ''Jugendfreundin'', Anne Mendelssohn Weil (\"Annchen\"). On emigrating to America, Hilde Frankel, Paul Tillich's secretary and mistress, filled that role until her death in 1950. After the war, Arendt was able to return to Germany and renew her relationship with Weil, who made several visits to New York, especially after Bl\u00fccher's death in 1970. Their last meeting was in [[Tegna, Switzerland]] in 1975, shortly before Arendt's death.{{sfn|Ludz|2008}} With Frankel's death, Mary McCarthy became Arendt's closest friend and confidante.{{sfn|Young-Bruehl|2004|loc=p.&nbsp;29}}{{sfn|Jones|2013}}{{sfn|Weigel|2013}}\n\n== Final illness and death ==\n[[File:HannahArendtGrave-BardCollege.jpg|thumb|Hannah Arendt's grave at [[Bard College]] Cemetery, [[Annandale-on-Hudson, New York]]]]\nHeinrich Bl\u00fccher had survived a [[cerebral aneurysm]] in 1961 and remained unwell after 1963, sustaining a series of heart attacks.

Intellectually, she was an independent thinker, a loner not a \"joiner\", separating herself from schools of thought or ideology.{{sfn|Young-Bruehl|2004|loc=p.&nbsp;xxxviii}} In addition to her major texts she published a number of anthologies, including ''[[Between Past and Future]]'' (1961),{{sfn|Arendt|1961}} ''Men in Dark Times'' (1968){{sfn|Arendt|1968}} and ''Crises of the Republic'' (1972).{{sfn|Arendt|1972}} She also contributed to many publications, including ''[[The New York Review of Books]]'', ''[[Commonweal (magazine)|Commonweal]]'', ''[[Dissent (American magazine)|Dissent]]'' and ''[[The New Yorker]]''.{{sfn|Berkowitz|2013}} She is perhaps best known for her accounts of [[Adolf Eichmann]] and his trial,{{sfn|Arendt|2006a}} because of the intense controversy that it generated.{{sfn|Heller|2015|loc=pp.1\u201332}}\n\n=== Political theory and philosophical system ===\n\nWhile Arendt never developed a coherent political theory and her writing does not easily lend itself to categorization, the tradition of thought most closely identified with Arendt is that of [[civic republicanism]], from Aristotle to [[Tocqueville]]. Her political concept is centered around [[active citizenship]] that emphasizes [[civic engagement]] and collective deliberation.{{sfn|d'Entreves|2014}} She believed that no matter how bad, government could never succeed in extinguishing human freedom, despite holding that modern societies frequently retreat from democratic freedom with its inherent disorder for the relative comfort of administrative bureaucracy. Her political legacy is her strong defense of freedom in the face of an increasingly less than free world.{{sfn|Berkowitz|2013}} She does not adhere to a single systematic philosophy, but rather spans a range of subjects covering totalitarianism, revolution, the nature of freedom and the faculties of thought and judgment.{{sfn|Yar|2018}}\n\nWhile she is best known for her work on \"dark times\",{{efn|Dark Times: A phrase she took from [[Brecht]]'s poem ''[[:de:An die Nachgeborenen|An die Nachgeborenen]]'' (\"To Those Born After\", 1938),{{sfn|Brecht|2018}} the first line of which reads ''Wirklich, ich lebe in finsteren Zeiten!'' (Truly, I live in dark times!). To both Brecht and Arendt, \"Dark Times\" was not merely a descriptive term for perceived atrocities but an explanation of the loss of guiding principles of theory, knowledge and explanation{{sfn|Luban|1994}}}} the nature of totalitarianism and evil, she imbued this with a spark of hope and confidence in the nature of mankind:{{sfn|Young-Bruehl|2004|loc=p.&nbsp;xxxviii}}\n\n<blockquote>That even in the darkest of times we have the right to expect some illumination, and that such illumination might well come less from theories and concepts than from the uncertain, flickering, and often weak light that some men and women, in their lives and their works, will kindle under almost all circumstances and shed over the time span that was given to them.{{sfn|Arendt|1968|loc=p&nbsp;.ix}}</blockquote>\n\n=== ''Love and Saint Augustine'' (1929) ===\n{{main|Love and Saint Augustine}}\nArendt's doctoral thesis, ''Der Liebesbegriff bei Augustin. Versuch einer philosophischen Interpretation''{{sfn|Arendt|1929}} (''Love and Saint Augustine''), was published in 1929 and attracted critical interest, although an English translation did not appear until 1996.{{sfn|Arendt|1996}} In this work, she combines approaches of both Heidegger and Jaspers. Arendt's interpretation of love in the work of Augustine deals with three concepts, love as craving or desire (''Amor qua appetitus''), love in the relationship between man (''creatura'') and creator (''Creator - Creatura''), and neighborly love (''Dilectio proximi''). Love as craving anticipates the future, while love for the Creator deals with the remembered past. Of the three, ''dilectio proximi''  or ''[[Charity (virtue)|caritas]]''{{efn|Latin has three nouns for love: ''amor'', ''dilectio'' and ''caritas''. The corresponding verbs for the first two are ''amare'' and ''diligere''{{sfn|Augustine|1995|loc=p.&nbsp;115 n.&nbsp;31}}}} is perceived as the most fundamental, to which the first two are oriented, which she treats under ''vita socialis'' (social life). The second of the [[Great Commandments]] (or [[Golden Rule]]) \"Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself\" uniting and transcending the former.{{efn|{{bibleref|Matthew|22:39|KJV}} }}{{sfn|Young-Bruehl|2004|loc=p.&nbsp;74}} Augustine's influence (and Jaspers' views on his work)  persisted in Arendt's writings for the rest of her life.{{sfn|Calcagno|2013}}\n\n{{quotebox|title=''Amor mundi''|align=right| quote= <poem>''Amor mundi\u200a\u2014\u200awarum ist es so schwer, die Welt zu lieben?''<br />Love of the world\u200a\u2014\u200awhy is it so difficult to love the world?</poem>|source= \u2014''Denktagebuch'' I: 522{{sfn|Arendt|2002a|loc=p.&nbsp;522}}}}\n\nSome of the [[leitmotifs]] of her canon were apparent, introducing the concept of ''[[:de:Natalit\u00e4t|Natalit\u00e4t]]'' (Natality) as a key condition of human existence and its role in the development of the individual,{{sfn|Arendt|1996}}{{sfn|Beiner|1997}}{{sfn|Kiess|2016|loc=pp.&nbsp;22,40}} developing this further in ''The Human Condition'' (1958).{{sfn|Arendt|2013}}{{sfn|Fry|2014}} She explained that the construct of natality was implied in her discussion of new beginnings and man's elation to the Creator as ''nova creatura''.{{sfn|Young-Bruehl|2004|loc=pp.&nbsp;49\u2013500}}{{sfn|Kiess|2016|loc=pp.&nbsp;101''ff''}} The centrality of the theme of birth and renewal is apparent in the constant reference to Augustinian thought, and specifically the innovative nature of birth, from this, her first work, to her last, ''The Life of the Mind''.{{sfn|Durst|2004}}\n\nLove is another connecting theme. In addition to the Augustinian loves expostulated in her dissertation, the phrase ''amor mundi'' (love of the world) is one often associated with Arendt and both permeates her work and was an absorbing passion throughout her work.{{sfn|Bernauer|1987a|loc=p.&nbsp;1}}{{sfn|Hill|2017}} She took the phrase from Augustine's homily on the [[:s:Nicene and Post-Nicene Fathers: Series I/Volume VII/First Epistle of John/Part 2|first epistle of St John]], \"If love of the world dwell in us\".{{sfn|Augustine|2008|loc=II: 8 p.&nbsp;45}} ''Amor mundi'' was her original title for ''The Human Condition'' (1958),{{efn|Arendt explained to Karl Jaspers, in a letter dated 6 August 1955, that she intended to use St Augustine's concept of ''amor mundi'' as the title, as a token of gratitude{{sfn|Vollrath|1997}}}}{{sfn|Bernauer|1987|loc=p.&nbsp;v}} the subtitle of Elisabeth Young-Bruehl's biography (1982),{{sfn|Young-Bruehl|2004}} the title of a collection of writing on faith in her work{{sfn|Bernauer|1987}} and is the newsletter of the Hannah Arendt Center at Bard College.{{sfn|Amor Mundi|2018}}\n\n=== ''The Origins of Totalitarianism'' (1951) ===\n{{Main|The Origins of Totalitarianism}}\nArendt's first major book, ''The Origins of Totalitarianism'' (1951),{{sfn|Arendt|1976}} examined the roots of [[Communism]] and [[Nazism]], structured as three essays, \"Antisemitism\", \"Imperialism\" and \"Totalitarianism\". Arendt argues that totalitarianism was a \"novel form of government,\" that \"differs essentially from other forms of political oppression known to us such as despotism, tyranny and dictatorship\"{{sfn|Arendt|1976|loc=p.&nbsp;460}} in that it applied terror to subjugate mass populations rather than just political adversaries.{{sfn|Arendt|1953}}{{sfn|FCG|2018|loc=Introduction}} Criticism included the interpretation that the two movements were portrayed as equally tyrannical.{{sfn|Nisbet|1992}} Arendt also maintained that Jewry was not the operative factor in the Holocaust, but merely a convenient proxy because Nazism was about terror and consistency, not merely eradicating Jews.{{sfn|Riesman|1951}}{{sfn|FCG|2018|loc=Introduction}} Arendt explained the tyranny using Kant's phrase \"Radical Evil\",{{sfn|Copjec|1996}} by which their victims became \"Superfluous People\".{{sfn|Hattem|Hattem|2005}}{{sfn|Heller|2015|loc=p.&nbsp;7}} In later editions she enlarged the text {{sfn|Arendt|1976|loc=p.&nbsp;xxiv}} to include her work on \"Ideology and Terror: A novel form of government\"{{sfn|Arendt|1953}} and the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956|Hungarian Revolution]], but then published the latter separately.{{sfn|Arendt|1958}}{{sfn|Arendt|1958a}}{{sfn|Sz\u00e9cs\u00e9nyi|2005}}\n\n=== ''Rahel Varnhagen: The Life of a Jewess'' (1957) ===\n\n{{Main|Rahel Varnhagen (book)}}\n\nArendt's ''Habilitationsschrift'' on Rahel Varnhagen was completed while she was living in exile in Paris in 1938, but not published till 1957, in the United Kingdom by East and West Library, part of the Leo Baeck Institute.{{sfn|Aschheim|2011}} This biography of a nineteenth century Jewish socialite, formed an important step in her analysis of Jewish history and the subjects of [[Jewish assimilation|assimilation]] and [[emancipation]], and introduced her treatment of the [[Jewish diaspora]] as either ''pariah'' or ''parvenu''.

Her account of Varnhagen's life was perceived during a time of the destruction of German-Jewish culture. It partially reflects Arendt's own view of herself as a German-Jewish woman driven out of her own culture into a [[Statelessness|stateless]] existence,{{sfn|Grunenberg|2003|loc=p.&nbsp;34}} leading to the description \"biography as autobiography\".{{sfn|Young-Bruehl|2004|loc=pp&nbsp;.85\u201392}}{{sfn|Goldstein|2009}}{{sfn|Cutting-Gray|1991}}\n\n=== ''The Human Condition'' (1958) ===\n{{Main|The Human Condition (book)|l1=The Human Condition}}\nIn what is arguably her most influential work, ''[[The Human Condition (book)|The Human Condition]]'' (1958),{{sfn|Arendt|2013}} Arendt differentiates political and social concepts, labor and work, and various forms of actions; she then explores the implications of those distinctions. Her theory of political action, corresponding to the existence of a public realm, is extensively developed in this work. Arendt argues that, while human life always evolves within societies, the social part of human nature, political life, has been intentionally realized in only a few societies as a space for individuals to achieve freedom. Conceptual categories, which attempt to bridge the gap between [[ontological]] and sociological structures, are sharply delineated. While Arendt relegates labor and work to the realm of the social, she favors the human condition of action as that which is both existential and aesthetic.{{sfn|d'Entreves|2014}} Of human actions, Arendt identifies two that she considers essential. These are forgiving past wrong (or unfixing the fixed past) and promising future benefit (or fixing the unfixed future).{{sfn|Baier|1997|loc=p.&nbsp;330}}\n\nArendt had first introduced the concept of \"natality\" in her ''Love and Saint Augustine'' (1929){{sfn|Arendt|1929}} and in ''The Human Condition'' starts to develop this further. In this, she departs from Heidegger's emphasis on mortality. Arendt's positive message is one of the \"miracle of beginning\", the continual arrival of the new to create action, that is to alter the state of affairs brought about by previous actions.{{sfn|Canovan|2013}} \"Men\", she wrote \"though they must die, are not born in order to die but in order to begin\". She defined her use of \"natality\" as:\n\n<blockquote>The miracle that saves the world, the realm of human affairs, from its normal, \"natural\" ruin is ultimately the fact of natality, in which the faculty of action is ontologically rooted. It is, in other words, the birth of new men and the new beginning, the action they are capable of by virtue of being born.{{sfn|Arendt|2013|loc=p.&nbsp;247}}</blockquote>\n\nNatality would go on to become a central concept of her political theory, and also what Karin Fry considers its most optimistic one.{{sfn|Fry|2014}}\n\n=== ''Between Past and Future'' (1954...1968) ===\n{{Main|Between Past and Future|l1=Between Past and Future}}\n''Between Past and Future'' is an [[anthology]] of eight essays written between 1954 and 1968, dealing with a variety of different but connected philosophical subjects. These essays share the central idea that humans live between the past and the uncertain future. Man must permanently think to exist, but must learn thinking. Humans have resorted to tradition, but are abandoning respect for this tradition and culture. Arendt tries to find solutions to help humans think again, since modern philosophy has not succeeded in helping humans to live correctly.{{sfn|Arendt|1961}}\n\n=== ''On Revolution'' (1963) ===\n{{main|On Revolution}}\nArendt's book ''On Revolution''{{sfn|Arendt|2006b}} presents a comparison of two of the main revolutions of the eighteenth century, the [[American Revolution|American]] and [[French Revolution|French]] Revolutions. She goes against a common impression of both Marxist and [[leftist]] views when she argues that France, while well-studied and often emulated, was a disaster and that the largely ignored American Revolution was a success. The turning point in the French Revolution occurred when the leaders rejected their goals of freedom in order to focus on compassion for the masses. In the [[United States]], the founders never betray the goal of ''{{lang|la|Constitutio Libertatis}}''. Arendt believes the revolutionary spirit of those men had been lost, however, and advocates a \"council system\" as an appropriate institution to regain that spirit.{{sfn|Wellmer|1999}}\n\n=== ''Men in Dark Times'' (1968) ===\n\nThe anthology of essays ''Men in Dark Times'' presents intellectual biographies of some creative and moral figures of the twentieth century, such as Walter Benjamin, Karl Jaspers, Rosa Luxemburg, [[Hermann Broch]], [[Pope John XXIII]], and [[Isak Dinesen]].{{sfn|Arendt|1968}}\n\n=== ''Crises of the Republic'' (1972) ===\n{{main|Crises of the Republic}}\n''Crises of the Republic''{{sfn|Arendt|1972}} was the third of Arendt's anthologies, consisting of four essays, \"Lying in Politics\", \"Civil Disobedience\", \"On Violence\" and \"Thoughts on Politics and Revolution\". These related essays deal with contemporary American politics and the crises it faced in the 1960s and 1970s. \"Lying in Politics\" looks for an explanation behind the administration's deception regarding the [[Vietnam War]], as revealed in the ''[[Pentagon Papers]]''. \"Civil Disobedience\" examines the opposition movements, while the final \"Thoughts on Politics and Revolution\" is a commentary, in the form of an interview on the third essay, \"On Violence\".{{sfn|Arendt|1972}}{{sfn|Nott|1972}} In \"On Violence\" Arendt substantiates that violence presupposes power which she understands as a property of groups. Thus, she breaks with the predominant conception of power as derived from violence.\n\n=== Poetry ===\n\nArendt was a minor poet, but kept this very private.{{sfn|Young-Bruehl|2004|loc=p.&nbsp;3}}{{sfn|Waterhouse|2013}}{{sfn|Bertheau|2016}} She had started writing at seventeen, and her work is marked by a deep [[Melancholia|melancholy]] she called ''M\u00fcdigkeit'' (weariness), a Romantic yearning from the past steeped in Kierkegaardian angst.

Since then a number of her minor works have been collected and published, mainly under the editorship of Jerome Kohn. In 1994 \"Essays in Understanding\" appeared as the first of a series covering the period 1930\u20131954, but attracted little attention. A new version of ''Origins of Totalitarianism'' appeared in 2004 followed by ''The Promise of Politics'' in 2005. The renewed interest in Arendtiana following these publications led to a second series of essays, ''Thinking Without a Banister: Essays in Understanding, 1953-1975'', published in 2018. Other collections have dealt with her Jewish identity, including ''The Jew as Pariah'' (1978) and ''The Jewish Writings'' (2007), moral philosophy including ''Lectures on Kant's Political Philosophy'' (1982) and ''Responsibility and Judgment'' (2003), together with her literary works as ''Reflections on Literature and Culture'' (2007).{{sfn|Miller|2017}}\n\n==== ''The Life of the Mind'' (1978) ====\n{{main|The Life of the Mind}}\n[[File:Immanuel Kant (painted portrait).jpg|thumb|upright|[[Immanuel Kant]]|alt=Portrait of Kant ]]\nArendt's last major work, ''The Life of the Mind''{{sfn|Arendt|1978a}} remained incomplete at the time of her death, but marked a return to moral philosophy. The outline of the book was based on her graduate level political philosophy class, ''Philosophy of the Mind'', and her [[Gifford Lectures]] in Scotland.{{sfn|Addison|1972\u20131974}} She conceived of the work as a trilogy based on the mental activities of thinking, willing, and judging. Her most recent work had focused on the first two, but went beyond this in terms of ''{{lang|la|vita activa}}''. her discussion of thinking was based on [[Socrates]] and his notion of thinking as a solitary dialogue between oneself, leading her to novel concepts of conscience.{{sfn|Ojakangas|2010}}\n\nArendt died suddenly five days after completing the second part, with the first page of Judging, still in her typewriter, and McCarthy then edited the first two parts and provided some indication of the direction of the third.{{sfn|Young-Bruehl|2004|loc=p.&nbsp;467}}{{sfn|Mckenna|1978}} Arendt's exact intentions for the third part are unknown but she left a number of manuscripts (such as ''Thinking and Moral Considerations'', ''Some Questions on Moral Philosophy'' and ''Lectures on Kant's Political Philosophy'') relating to her thoughts on the mental [[Aesthetic judgment|faculty of Judging]]. These have since been published separately.{{sfn|Arendt|2009}}{{sfn|Arendt|1992}}\n\n==== Collected works ====\n\nAfter Hannah Arendt's death a number of her essays and notes have continued to be edited and published posthumously by friends and colleagues, including those that give some insight into the unfinished third part of ''[[#The Life of the Mind|The Life of the Mind]]''.{{sfn|Miller|2017}} ''The Jew as Pariah: Jewish Identity and Politics in the Modern Age'' (1978),{{sfn|Arendt|1978b}} is a collection of 15 essays and letters from the period 1943\u20131966 on the situation of Jews in modern times, to try and throw some light on her views on the Jewish world, following the backlash to ''Eichmann'', but proved to be equally polarizing.{{sfn|Dannhauser|1979}}{{sfn|Botstein|1983}} A further collection of her writings on being Jewish was published as ''The Jewish Writings'' (2007).{{sfn|Arendt|2009a}}{{sfn|Butler|2007}} Other work includes the collection of forty, largely fugitive,{{efn|Fugitive writings: Dealing with subjects of passing interest}} essays, addresses, and reviews entitled ''Essays in Understanding 1930\u20131954: Formation, Exile, and Totalitarianism'' (1994),{{sfn|Arendt|2011}} that presaged her monumental ''The Origins of Totalitarianism'',{{sfn|Arendt|1976}} in particular ''On the Nature of Totalitarianism'' (1953) and ''The Concern with Politics in Contemporary European Philosophical Thought'' (1954).{{sfn|Teichman|1994}} The remaining essays were published as ''Thinking Without a Banister: Essays in Understanding, 1953-1975'' (2018).{{sfn|Arendt|2018}} Her notebooks which form a series of memoirs, were published as ''Denktagebuch'' in 2002.{{sfn|Arendt|2002a}}{{sfn|Arendt|2002b}}{{sfn|Berkowitz|Storey|2017}}\n\n==== {{vanchor|Correspondence}} ====\n\nSome further insight into her thinking is provided in the continuing posthumous publication of her correspondence with many of the important figures in her life, including Karl Jaspers (1992),{{sfn|Arendt|Jaspers|1992}} Mary McCarthy (1995),{{sfn|Arendt|McCarthy|1995}} Heinrich Bl\u00fccher (1996),{{sfn|Arendt|Bl\u00fccher|2000}} Martin Heidegger (2004),{{efn|Arendt/Heidegger: Arendt willed that her correspondence be taken to the Deutsches Literaturarchiv in Marbach in 1976 and sealed for 5 years, and Heidegger's family stipulated that it remained sealed during Martin Heidegger's wife Elfride's lifetime (1893\u20131992). In 1976, [[Elzbieta Ettinger]] sought access and was granted this for a planned biography after Elfride's death. The subsequent scandal following Ettinger's disclosures, led to a decision to publish the correspondence in entirety{{sfn|Kohler|1996}}{{sfn|Lilla|1999}}}}{{sfn|Arendt|Heidegger|2004}} [[Alfred Kazin]] (2005),{{sfn|Arendt|Kazin|2005}} Walter Benjamin (2006),{{sfn|Arendt|Benjamin|2006}} [[Gershom Scholem]] (2011){{sfn|Arendt|Scholem|2017}} and [[G\u00fcnther Stern]] (2016).{{sfn|Arendt|Anders|2016}}  Other correspondence that has been published, include those with a number of women friends such as Hilde Fr\u00e4nkel and Anne Mendelsohn Weil (''see'' [[#Relationships|Relationships]]).{{sfn|Arendt|2017}}\n{{sfn|Arendt|Benjamin|2006}}\n\n=== Arendt and the Eichmann trial (1961\u20131963) ===\n{{Main|Eichmann in Jerusalem}}\n[[File:Adolf Eichmann at Trial1961.jpg|thumb|upright|Eichmann on trial in 1961]]\nIn 1960, on hearing of Adolf Eichmann's capture and plans for [[Adolf Eichmann trial|his trial]], Hannah Arendt contacted ''The New Yorker'' and offered to travel to Israel to cover it when it opened on 11 April 1961.{{sfn|Heller|2015|loc=p.&nbsp;2}} Arendt was anxious to test her theories, developed in ''The Origins of Totalitarianism'', and see how justice would be administered to the sort of man she had written about. Also she had witnessed \"little of the Nazi regime directly\"{{efn|Arendt to Jaspers, 2 December 1960}}{{sfn|Arendt|Jaspers|1992|loc=pp.&nbsp;409\u2013410}} and this was an opportunity to witness an agent of totalitarianism first hand.{{sfn|Heller|2015|loc=p.&nbsp;7}}\n\nThe offer was accepted and she attended six weeks of the five-month trial with her young cousin from Israel, [[:de:Edna Brocke|Edna Brocke]].{{sfn|Heller|2015|loc=p.&nbsp;2}} On arrival she was treated as a celebrity, meeting with the trial chief judge, [[Moshe Landau]], and the [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Israel)|foreign minister]], [[Golda Meir]].{{sfn|Heller|2015|loc=p.&nbsp;8}} In her subsequent 1963 report,{{sfn|Arendt|1963}} based on her observations and transcripts,{{sfn|Heller|2015|loc=p.&nbsp;2}} and which evolved into the book ''[[Eichmann in Jerusalem: A Report on the Banality of Evil]]'',{{sfn|Arendt|2006a}} Arendt was critical of the way the trial was conducted by the Israelis as a \"show trial\" with ulterior motives other than simply trying evidence and administering justice.{{sfn|NYT|1960a}}{{sfn|Heller|2015|loc=p.&nbsp;8}} She portrayed the prosecutor, [[Attorney General of Israel|Attorney General]] [[Gideon Hausner]], as one who employed hyperbolic rhetoric in the pursuit of [[Prime Minister of Israel|Prime Minister]] [[Ben-Gurion]]'s political agenda.{{sfn|Heller|2015|loc=p.&nbsp;8\u201311}} Arendt, who believed she could maintain her focus on moral principles in the face of outrage, became increasingly frustrated with Hausner, describing his parade of survivors as having \"no apparent bearing on the case\".{{efn|A position that the judges would later agree with{{sfn|Heller|2015|loc=p.&nbsp;12}}}}{{sfn|Arendt|2006a|loc=p.&nbsp;207}} She objected to the idea that a strong Israel was necessary to protect world Jewry being again placed where \"they'll let themselves be slaughtered like sheep\", recalling the [[Like sheep to the slaughter|biblical phrase]].{{efn|Arendt to Jaspers, 23 December 1960}}{{sfn|Arendt|Jaspers|1992|loc=pp.&nbsp;416}} She was particularly concerned that Hausner repeatedly asked \"why did you not rebel?\",{{sfn|Arendt|2006a|loc=p.&nbsp;124}} rather than question the role of the Jewish leaders, as she would do with unforeseen consequences.{{sfn|Heller|2015|loc=p.&nbsp;12}}\n\nMost famously, Arendt coined the phrase \"the [[banality of evil]]\" to describe the phenomenon of Eichmann. She, like others,{{sfn|Gellhorn|1962}} was struck by his very ordinariness and the demeanor he exhibited of a small, slightly balding, bland bureaucrat, in contrast to the horrific crimes he stood accused of.{{sfn|Scott|2016}} He was, she wrote, \"terribly and terrifyingly normal\".{{sfn|Arendt|2006a|loc=p.&nbsp;276}} She examined the question of whether [[evil]] is radical or simply a function of thoughtlessness, a tendency of ordinary people to obey orders and conform to mass opinion without a critical evaluation of the consequences of their actions. Arendt's argument was that Eichmann was not a monster, contrasting the immensity of his actions with the very ordinariness of the man himself. Eichmann, she stated, not only called himself a Zionist, having initially opposed the Jewish persecution, but also expected his captors to understand him. She pointed out that his actions were not driven by malice, but rather blind dedication to the regime and his need to belong, to be a joiner.\n\nOn this, Arendt would later state \"Going along with the rest and wanting to say 'we' were quite enough to make the greatest of all crimes possible\".{{efn|\"''Er wollte Wir sagen, und dies Mitmachen und dies Wir-Sagen-Wollen war ja ganz genug, um die allergr\u00f6ssten Verbrechen m\u00f6glich zu machen.''\"}}{{sfn|Arendt|Fest|1964}} What Arendt observed during the trial was a bourgeois sales clerk who found a meaningful role for himself and a sense of importance in the Nazi movement. She noted that his addiction to clich\u00e9s and use of bureaucratic morality clouded his ability to question his actions, \"to think\". This led her to set out her most famous, and most debated, dictum: \"the lesson that this long course in human wickedness had taught us \u2013 the lesson of the fearsome, word-and-thought-defying banality of evil\".{{sfn|Arendt|1963}}{{sfn|Berkowitz|2013}} By stating that Eichmann did not think, she did not imply lack of conscious awareness of his actions, but by \"thinking\" she implied reflective rationality, that was lacking. Arendt, who eschewed [[identity politics]], was also critical of the way Israel depicted Eichmann's crimes as crimes against a nation state, rather than against humanity itself.{{sfn|Butler|2011}}\n\nArendt was also critical of the way that some Jewish leaders associated with the Jewish Councils ([[Judenr\u00e4te]]), notably [[Mordechai Chaim Rumkowski|M. C. Rumkowski]], acted during [[the Holocaust]], in cooperating with Eichmann \"almost without exception\" in the destruction of their own people.{{sfn|Arendt|2006a|loc=p.&nbsp;123}} She had expressed concerns on this point, prior to the trial.{{efn|Arendt to Jaspers, 23 December 1960}}{{sfn|Arendt|Jaspers|1992|loc=p.&nbsp;417}} She described this as a moral catastrophe. While her argument was not to allocate blame, rather she mourned what she considered a moral failure of compromising the imperative that it is better to suffer wrong than to do wrong. She describes the cooperation of the Jewish leaders in terms of a disintegration of Jewish morality: \"This role of the Jewish leaders in the destruction of their own people is undoubtedly the darkest chapter in the whole dark story\". Widely misunderstood, this caused an even greater controversy and particularly animosity toward her in the Jewish community and in Israel.{{sfn|Berkowitz|2013}} For Arendt, the Eichmann trial marked a turning point in her thinking in the final decade of her life, becoming increasingly preoccupied with [[moral philosophy]].{{sfn|Luban|2018|loc=p.&nbsp;5}}\n\n==== Reception ====\n\nArendt's five-part series \"Eichmann in Jerusalem\" appeared in the ''New Yorker'' in February 1963{{sfn|Arendt|1963}} some nine months after Eichmann was hanged on 31 May 1962. By this time his trial was largely forgotten in the popular mind, superseded by intervening world events.{{sfn|Heller|2015|loc=p.&nbsp;15}} However, no other account of either Eichmann or National Socialism has aroused so much controversy.{{sfn|Stangneth|2014|loc=p.&nbsp;200}} Prior to its publication, Arendt was considered a brilliant humanistic original political thinker.{{sfn|Heller|2015|loc=p.&nbsp;1}} However her mentor, Karl Jaspers, warned her about a possible adverse outcome, \"The Eichmann trial will be no pleasure for you. I'm afraid it cannot go well\".{{efn|Jaspers to Arendt 14 October 1960{{sfn|Arendt|Jaspers|1992|loc=p.&nbsp;267}}}}{{sfn|Heller|2015|loc=p.&nbsp;7}} On publication, three controversies immediately occupied public attention: the concept of Eichmann as banal, her criticism of the role of Israel and her description of the role played by the Jewish people themselves.{{sfn|Heller|2015|loc=pp.&nbsp;15\u201318}}\n\nArendt was profoundly shocked by the response, writing to Karl Jaspers \"People are resorting to any means to destroy my reputation ... They have spent weeks trying to find something in my past that they can hang on me\". Now she was being called arrogant, heartless and ill-informed. She was accused of being duped by Eichmann, of being a \"self-hating Jewess\", and even an enemy of Israel.{{sfn|Maier-Katkin|2010}}{{sfn|Maier-Katkin|2011}}{{sfn|Heller|2015|loc=p.&nbsp;1}} Her critics included [[The Anti-Defamation League]] and many other Jewish groups, editors of publications she was a contributor to, faculty at the universities she taught at and friends from all parts of her life.{{sfn|Heller|2015|loc=p.&nbsp;1}} Her friend Gershom Scholem, a major scholar of [[Kabbalah|Jewish mysticism]], broke off relations with her, publishing their correspondence without her permission.{{sfn|Heller|2015|loc=pp.&nbsp;29\u201331}} Arendt was criticized by many Jewish public figures, who charged her with coldness and lack of sympathy for the victims of the Holocaust. Because of this lingering criticism neither this book nor any of her other works were translated into Hebrew until 1999.{{sfn|Elon|2006a}} Arendt responded to the controversies in the book's Postscript.\n\nAlthough Arendt complained that she was being criticized for telling the truth \u2013 \"what a risky business to tell the truth on a factual level without theoretical and scholarly embroidery\"{{efn|Letter to McCarthy 16 September 1963}}{{sfn|Arendt|McCarthy|1995| loc=p.&nbsp;146}} \u2013 the criticism was largely directed to her theorizing on the nature of mankind and evil and that ordinary people were driven to commit the inexplicable not so much by hatred and ideology as ambition, and inability to empathize. Equally problematic was the suggestion that the victims deceived themselves and complied in their own destruction.{{sfn|Heller|2015|loc=pp.&nbsp;1\u20132}} Prior to Arendt's depiction of Eichmann, his popular image had been, as the ''New York Times'' put it \"the most evil monster of humanity\"{{sfn|NYT|1960}} and as a representative of \"an atrocious crime, unparalleled in history\", \"the extermination of European Jews\".{{sfn|NYT|1960a}} As it turned out Arendt and others were correct in pointing out that Eichmann's characterization by the prosecution as the architect and chief technician of the holocaust was not entirely credible.{{sfn|Heller|2015|loc=p.&nbsp;5}}\n\nRoger Berkowitz states that Arendt neither defended Eichmann, nor denied that his actions were evil and that he was an anti-semite, nor that he should be executed for his actions. But rather that we should understand that those actions were neither monstrous, nor sadistic. In understanding Eichmann, Arendt argues, we come to understand a greater truth about the nature of evil, that individuals participate in atrocities from an inability to critically examine blind allegiance to ideologies that provide a sense of meaning in a lonely and alienating world. Thus, she concludes, thoughtless zealotry is the face of evil in the modern world.{{sfn|Berkowitz|2013}} Nor was Arendt alone in raising concerns about the role played by the ''Judenr\u00e4te''.{{sfn|Wieseltier|1981}}\n\nRejections of Arendt's characterization of Eichmann{{sfn|Walters|2015}} and allegations of racism against her have persisted ever since,{{sfn|Frantzman|2016}} though much of this is based on information that was not available at the time of the trial.{{sfn|Stangneth|2014|loc=p.&nbsp;200}} Issues around factual accuracy have been disputed, as well as whether Eichmann was merely dissembling. [[Irving Howe]], one of her critics, described how the Eichmann issue engendered what approached \"civil war\" amongst New York intellectuals. Howe rightly surmised that \"such controversies are never settled. They die down, simmer, and erupt again\".{{sfn|Howe|2013}} Thus the appearance of the 2012 film ''[[#Hannah Arendt (2012)|Hannah Arendt]]'' reignited the controversy. Berkowitz states that claiming Arendt exonerated Eichmann as simply a man who followed orders, is a misreading of the book. In fact she argued that Eichmann acted equally out of conviction, and even at times disobeyed orders, such as those of [[Himmler]]. Eichmann was, as Berkowitz states, \"someone convinced that he was sacrificing an easy morality for a higher good\".{{sfn|Berkowitz|2013a}}{{sfn|Wolters|2013}} What has emerged following this revisiting of the controversy, is a consensus that whether Arendt was right or wrong about Eichmann, she was correct about the nature of evil,{{sfn|Austerlitz|2013}}{{sfn|Kaplan|2013}}{{sfn|Browning|2013}} in that events of horror can too easily arise from origins that are mundane. Arendt's depiction of the nature of evil has proved both tenacious and timeless in its relevance.{{sfn|Scott|2016}}\n\nWhile much has been made of Arendt's treatment of Eichmann, Ada Ushpiz, in her 2015 documentary ''Vita Activa: The Spirit of Hannah Arendt'',{{sfn|Zeitgeist|2015}} placed it in a much broader context of the use of rationality to explain seemingly irrational historical events.{{efn|The title ''vita activa'' (active life) is taken from Arendt's position in ''The Human Condition''(1958) that thinking is a form of action, and that the active life is as important as the contemplative (''vita contemplativa''){{sfn|Scott|2016}}}}{{sfn|Scott|2016}}\n\n==== {{vanchor|''Niemand hat das Recht zu gehorchen''}} ====\n{{multiple image | header =  Palazzo degli Uffici Finanziari, Bolzano| align = center | direction = horizontal | total_width = 300 | float = none\n|image1=Piffraderrelief Bozen 2017.jpg|caption1 =  |alt1= University of Berlin\n|image2=Fassade finanzamt bozen 2018.jpg|caption2=|alt2=University of Marburg\n|footer= By Day and Night.

Arendt replied that that was outrageous and that Eichmann was misusing Kant, by not considering the element of judgement required in assessing one's own actions \u2013 \"''Kein Mensch hat bei Kant das Recht zu gehorchen''\" (No man has, according to Kant, the right to obey), she stated, paraphrasing Kant. The reference was to Kant's ''[[Die Religion innerhalb der Grenzen der blo\u00dfen Vernunft]]'' (Religion within the Bounds of Bare Reason 1793) in which he states:\n\n<blockquote>''Der Satz 'man mu\u00df Gott mehr gehorchen, als den Menschen' bedeutet nur, da\u00df, wenn die letzten etwas gebieten, was an sich b\u00f6se (dem Sittengesetz unmittelbar zuwider) ist, ihnen nicht gehorcht werden darf und soll''{{sfn|Kant|1793|loc=p.&nbsp;99}} (The saying, \"''We must hearken to God, rather than to man'',\" signifies no more than this, viz. that should any earthly legislation enjoin something immediately contradictory of the moral law, obedience is not to be rendered{{sfn|Kant|1838|loc=p.&nbsp;125}})</blockquote>\n\nKant clearly defines a higher moral duty than rendering merely unto Caesar. Arendt herself had written in her book \"This was outrageous, on the face of it, and also incomprehensible, since Kant's moral philosophy is so closely bound up with man's faculty of judgment, which rules out blind obedience.\"{{sfn|Arendt|2006a|loc=p.&nbsp;135}} Arendt's reply to Fest was subsequently corrupted to read ''Niemand hat das Recht zu gehorchen'' (No one has the right to obey), which has been widely reproduced, although it does encapsulate an aspect of her moral philosophy.{{sfn|Miller|2017}}{{sfn|Krieghofer|2017}}\n\nThe phrase ''Niemand hat das Recht zu gehorchen'' has become one of her iconic images, appearing on the wall of the house in which she was born (''see'' [[#Commemorations|Commemorations]]), among other places.{{sfn|HAT|2018}} A [[fascist]] [[bas-relief]] on the [[Casa del Fascio (Bolzano)|Palazzo degli Uffici Finanziari]] (1942), in the Piazza del Tribunale,{{efn|The Palazzo degli Uffici Finanziari was originally the Casa del Fascio and the square, the Piazza [[Arnaldo Mussolini]], and was erected as the Fascist headquarters for the region.

She wrote:\n\n<blockquote>On top, the judges, the best of German Jewry. Below them, the prosecuting attorneys, [[Galicia (Eastern Europe)|Galicians]], but still Europeans. Everything is organized by a police force that gives me the creeps, speaks only Hebrew, and looks Arabic. Some downright brutal types among them. They would obey any order. And outside the doors, the oriental mob, as if one were in Istanbul or some other half-Asiatic country.{{sfn|Kirsch|2009}}</blockquote>\n\nAlthough Arendt remained a Zionist both during and after World War II, she made it clear that she favored the creation of a Jewish-Arab federated state in Palestine, rather than a purely Jewish state. She believed that this was a way to address Jewish statelessness and to avoid the pitfalls of nationalism.{{sfn|Seliger|2011}}{{sfn|Butler|2007}}\n\nIt was not just Arendt's analysis of the Eichmann trial that drew accusations of racism. In her 1958 essay in ''Dissent'' entitled ''Reflections on Little Rock''{{sfn|Arendt|1959}} she expressed opposition to [[desegregation]] following the 1957 [[Little Rock Integration Crisis]] in Arkansas. As she explains in the preface, for a long time the magazine was reluctant to print her contribution, so far did it appear to differ from the publication's liberal values. Eventually it was printed alongside critical responses. Later the ''[[New Yorker (magazine)|New Yorker]]'' would express similar hesitancy over the Eichmann papers. So vehement was the response, that Arendt felt obliged to defend herself in a sequel.{{sfn|Arendt|1959a}} The debate over this essay has continued since.{{sfn|Morey|2011}} William Simmons devotes a whole section of his 2011 text on [[human rights]] (''Human Rights Law and the Marginalized Other''){{sfn|Simmons|2011}} to a critique of Arendt's position and in particular on Little Rock.{{sfn|Simmons|2011a}} While a number of critics feel she was fundamentally racist,{{sfn|Burroughs|2015}} many of those who have defended Arendt's position have pointed out that her concerns were for the welfare of the children, a position she maintained throughout her life. She felt that the children were being subjected to trauma in order to serve a broader political strategy of forcible integration.{{sfn|Lebeau|2016}} While over time Arendt conceded some ground to her critics, namely that she argued as an outsider, she remained committed to her central critique that children should not be thrust into the front-lines of geopolitical conflict.{{sfn|Pickett|2009}}\n\n=== Feminism ===\n\nEmbraced by [[feminists]] as a pioneer in a world dominated by men up to her time, Arendt did not call herself a feminist and would be very surprised to hear herself described as a feminist,{{sfn|Baier|1995|loc=p.&nbsp;301}}{{sfn|Baier|1998|loc=p.&nbsp;254}} remaining opposed to the social dimensions of [[Women's Liberation]], urging independence, but always keeping in mind ''Viva{{Not a typo}} la petite diff\u00e9rence!''{{sfn|Young-Bruehl|2004|loc=p.&nbsp;238}} On becoming the first woman to be appointed a professor at Princeton in 1953, the media were much engaged in this exceptional achievement, but she never wanted to be seen as an exception, either as a woman (an \"exception woman\"){{sfn|Courtine-Denamy|2000|loc=p.&nbsp;36}} or a Jew, stating emphatically  \"I am not disturbed at all about being a woman professor, because I am quite used to being a woman\".{{sfn|Baier|1998|loc=p.&nbsp;255}} In 1972, discussing women's liberation, she observed \"the real question to ask is, what will we lose if we win?\".{{sfn|Baier|1997|loc=p.&nbsp;332}} She rather enjoyed what she saw as the privileges of being feminine as opposed to feminist, \"Intensly feminine and therefore no feminist\", stated Hans Jonas.{{sfn|Courtine-Denamy|2000|loc=p.&nbsp;36}} Arendt considered some professions and positions unsuitable for women, particularly those involving leadership, telling [[G\u00fcnter Gaus]] \"It just doesn't look good when a woman gives orders\".{{sfn|Courtine-Denamy|2000|loc=p.&nbsp;35}} Despite these views, and having been labelled \"anti-feminist\", much space has been devoted to examining Arendt's place in relation to feminism.{{sfn|Markus|1987}}{{sfn|Honig|2010}} In the last years of her life, [[Virginia Held]] noted that Arendt's views evolved with the emergence of a [[History of feminism|new feminism in America in the 1970s]] to recognize the importance of the women's movement.{{sfn|Held|Kazin|1982}}\n\n=== Critique of human rights ===\n\nIn ''The Origins of Totalitarianism'', Hannah Arendt devotes a lengthy chapter (''The Decline of the Nation-State and the End of the Rights of Man''){{sfn|Arendt|1976|loc=pp.&nbsp;267\u2013302}} to a critical analysis of human rights, in what has been described as \"the most widely read essay on refugees ever published\".{{sfn|Lamey|2011|loc=p.&nbsp;14}} Arendt is not skeptical of the notion of political rights in general, but instead defends a national or civil conception of rights.{{sfn|Arendt|1976|loc=p.&nbsp;389}} Human rights, or the Rights of Man as they were commonly called, are universal, inalienable, and possessed simply by virtue of being human. In contrast, civil rights are possessed by virtue of belonging to a political community, most commonly by being a citizen. Arendt's primary criticism of human rights is that they are ineffectual and illusory because their enforcement is in tension with national sovereignty.{{sfn|Lamey|2011|loc=pp.&nbsp;17\u201319}} She argued that since there is no political authority above that of sovereign nations, state governments have little incentive to respect human rights when such policies conflict with national interests. This can be seen most clearly by examining the treatment of refugees and other stateless people. Since the refugee has no state to secure their civil rights, the only rights they have to fall back on are human rights. In this way Arendt uses the refugee as a test case for examining human rights in isolation from civil rights.{{sfn|Birmingham|2006}}\n\nArendt's analysis draws on the refugee upheavals in the first half of the twentieth century along with her own experience as a refugee fleeing Nazi Germany. She argued that as state governments began to emphasize national identity as a prerequisite for full legal status, the number of minority resident aliens increased along with the number of stateless persons whom no state was willing to recognize legally.{{sfn|Arendt|1976|loc=p.&nbsp;379\u2013381}} The two potential solutions to the refugee problem, repatriation and naturalization, both proved incapable of solving the crisis. Arendt argued that repatriation failed to solve the refugee crisis because no government was willing to take them in and claim them as their own. When refugees were forcibly deported to neighboring countries, such immigration was deemed illegal by the receiving country, and so failed to change the fundamental status of the migrants as stateless. Attempts at naturalizing and assimilating refugees also had little success. This failure was primarily the result of resistance from both state governments and the majority of citizens, since both tended to see the refugees as undesirables who threatened their national identity. Resistance to naturalization also came from the refugees themselves who resisted assimilation and attempted to maintain their own ethnic and national identities.{{sfn|Arendt|1976|loc=p.&nbsp;378\u2013384}} Arendt contends that neither naturalization nor the tradition of asylum was capable of handling the sheer number of refugees. Instead of accepting some refugees with legal status, the state often responded by denaturalizing minorities who shared national or ethnic ties with stateless refugees.{{sfn|Birmingham|2006}}\n\nArendt argues that the consistent mistreatment of refugees, most of whom were placed in internment camps, is evidence against the existence of human rights. If the notion of human rights as universal and inalienable is to be taken seriously, the rights must be realizable given the features of the modern liberal state.{{sfn|Lamey|2011|loc=pp.&nbsp;27\u201329}} She concluded \"The Rights of Man, supposedly inalienable, proved to be unenforceable\u2013even in countries whose constitutions were based upon them\u2013whenever people appeared who were no longer citizens of any sovereign state\".{{sfn|Arendt|1976|loc=p.&nbsp;293}} Arendt contends that they are not realizable because they are in tension with at least one feature of the liberal state\u2014national sovereignty. One of the primary ways in which a nation exercises sovereignty is through control over national borders. State governments consistently grant their citizens free movement to traverse national borders. In contrast, the movement of refugees is often restricted in the name of national interests.{{sfn|Lamey|2011|loc=pp.&nbsp;239\u2013240}} This restriction presents a dilemma for liberalism because liberal theorists typically are committed to both human rights and the existence of sovereign nations.{{sfn|Birmingham|2006}}\n\nIn one of her most quoted passages,{{sfn|Lamey|2011|loc=p.&nbsp;18}} she puts forward the concept that human rights are little more than an abstraction:\n\n<blockquote>The conception of human rights based upon the assumed existence of a human being as such broke down at the very moment when those who professed to believe in it were for the first time confronted with people who had indeed lost all other qualities and specific relationships - except that they were still human. The world found nothing sacred in the abstract nakedness of being human.{{sfn|Arendt|1976|loc=p.&nbsp;299}}</blockquote>\n\n== In popular culture ==\n\nSeveral authors have written biographies that focus on the relationship between Hannah Arendt and Martin Heidegger.{{sfn|Ettinger|1997}}{{sfn|Grunenberg|2017}}{{sfn|Maier-Katkin|2010a}} In 1999, the French feminist philosopher [[Catherine Cl\u00e9ment]] wrote a novel, ''Martin and Hannah'',{{sfn|Cl\u00e9ment|2001}} speculating on the triangular relationship between Heidegger and the two women in his life, Arendt and Heidegger's wife Elfriede Petri. In addition to the relationships, the novel is a serious exploration of philosophical ideas, that centers on Arendt's last meeting with Heidegger in Freiburg in 1975. The scene is based on Elisabeth Young-Bruehl's description in ''Hannah Arendt: For Love of the World'' (1982),{{sfn|Young-Bruehl|2004}} but reaches back to their childhoods, and Heidegger's role in encouraging the relationship between the two women.{{sfn|Kristeva|2001}} The novel explores Heidegger's embrace of Nazism as a proxy for that of Germany and, as in Arendt's treatment of Eichmann, the difficult relationship between collective guilt and personal responsibility. Cl\u00e9ment also brings Hannah's other mentor and confidante, Karl Jaspers, into the matrix of relationships.{{sfn|Schroeder|2002}}\n\nHannah Arendt - and parts of her life before America - appears as the appropriately named Athena at the end of Book II and particularly in Chapters 9-11 (Berlin, Dresden, 1933) and Chapter 49 (Montauban, 1940) in Book III of the series of novels 'In the Shadow of the Fallen'.\n\n=== {{vanchor|''Hannah Arendt'' (2012)}} ===\n{{main|Hannah Arendt (film)}}\nArendt's life remains part of current culture and thought. In 2012 the German film, ''Hannah Arendt'', directed by [[Margarethe von Trotta]] was released. The film, with [[Barbara Sukowa]] in the title role, depicted the controversy over Arendt's coverage of the Eichmann trial and subsequent book,{{sfn|Arendt|2006a}} in which she was widely misunderstood as defending Eichmann and blaming Jewish leaders for the Holocaust.{{sfn|BBFC|2018}}{{sfn|IMDb|2012}}\n\n== Legacy ==\n[[File:Hannah-Arendt-Strasse-Berlin.jpg|thumb|upright|Hannah-Arendt Stra\u00dfe in Berlin]]\nHannah Arendt is widely considered one of the most influential political philosophers of the twentieth century.{{sfn|d'Entreves|2014}} As a political theorist, moral philosopher and polemicist, she is unmatched in both range and rigor.{{sfn|Scott|2016}} In 1998 [[Walter Laqueur]] stated \"No twentieth-century philosopher and political thinker has at the present time as wide an echo\", as philosopher, historian, sociologist and also journalist.{{sfn|Laqueur|1998}} In popular imagination she is known primarily for the reaction to her work on Adolf Eichmann, and in particular for the one phrase \"the banality of evil\".{{sfn|Scott|2016}} Arendt's legacy has been described as a cult,{{sfn|Laqueur|1998}}{{sfn|Shenhav|2007}} yet she shunned publicity, never expecting, as she explained to Karl Jaspers in 1951, to see herself as a \"cover girl\" on the newsstands.{{efn|Letter to Jaspers 14 May 1951.{{sfn|Arendt|Jaspers|1992|loc=p.&nbsp;170}} Her image appeared on the cover of the ''[[Saturday Review of Literature]]'' on Saturday, 24 March 1951 (''see [[#SRL|image]]''), shortly after the publication of ''The Origins of Totalitarianism''. She also appeared on ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' and ''[[Newsweek]]'' in the same week{{sfn|Ring|1998|loc=p.&nbsp;106}}}}{{sfn|Young-Bruehl|2004|loc=p.&nbsp;xxxviii}} In Germany, there are tours available of sites associated with her life.{{sfn|Kulturreise|2018}}\n\nThe study of the life and work of Hannah Arendt, and of her political and philosophical theory is described as [[:wikt:Arendtian|Arendtian]].{{sfn|HAC Verona|2018 }}{{sfn|Canovan|2013}} In her will she established the Hannah Arendt Bluecher Literary Trust as the custodian of her writings and photographs.{{sfn|Kohn|2018}} Her personal library was deposited at Bard College at the Stevenson Library in 1976, and includes approximately 4,000 books, [[ephemera]], and pamphlets from Arendt's last apartment as well as her desk (in McCarthy House).{{sfn|About HAC Bard|2018}} The college has begun archiving some of the collection digitally, which is available at The Hannah Arendt Collection.{{sfn|Bard|2018}} Most of her papers were deposited at the [[Library of Congress]] and her correspondence with her German friends and mentors, such as Heidegger, Blumenfeld and Jaspers, at the [[:de:Deutsches Literaturarchiv Marbach|Deutsches Literaturarchiv]] in Marbach.{{sfn|Young-Bruehl|2004|loc=p.&nbsp;xlvii}} The Library of Congress listed more than 50 books written about her in 1998, and that number has continued to grow, as have the number of scholarly articles, estimated as 1000 at that time.{{sfn|Laqueur|1998}}\n\nHer life and work is recognized by the institutions most closely associated with her teaching, by the creation of Hannah Arendt Centers at both Bard (Hannah Arendt Center for Politics and Humanities){{sfn|HAC Bard|2018}} and The New School,{{sfn|Bernstein|2017}} both in New York State. In Germany, her contributions to understanding [[authoritarianism]] is recognised by the Hannah-Arendt-Institut f\u00fcr Totalitarismusforschung ([[Hannah Arendt Institute for the Research on Totalitarianism]]) in [[Dresden]]. There are Hannah Arendt Associations (Hannah Arendt Verein){{sfn|Laqueur|1998}} such as the Hannah Arendt Verein f\u00fcr politisches Denken in [[Bremen]] that awards the annual Hannah-Arendt-Preis f\u00fcr politisches Denken ([[Hannah Arendt Prize for Political Thinking]]) established in 1995. In [[Oldenburg]], the Hannah Arendt Center at [[Carl von Ossietzky University]] was established in 1999,{{sfn|HAC Oldenburg|2018}} and holds a large collection of her work (Hannah Arendt Archiv),{{sfn|HAArchiv|2018}} and administers the [[internet portal]] ''HannahArendt.net'' (A Journal for Political Thinking){{sfn|Heuer|2018}} as well as a monograph series, the ''Hannah Arendt-Studien''.{{sfn|Grunenberg|2018}} In Italy, the Hannah Arendt Center for Political Studies is situated at the [[University of Verona]] for Arendtian studies.{{sfn|HAC Verona|2018 }}\n\nIn 2017 a journal, ''Arendt Studies'', was launched to publish articles related to the study of the life, work, and legacy of Hannah Arendt.{{sfn|Barry|2017}} Many places associated with her, have memorabilia of her on display, such as her student card at the University of Heidelberg (''see image'').{{sfn|UHeidelberg|2015}} 2006, the anniversary of her birth, saw commemorations of her work in conferences and celebrations around the world.{{sfn|Villa|2009}}\n\nIn 2015, the filmmaker Ada Ushpiz produced a documentary on Hannah Arendt, ''Vita Activa: The Spirit of Hannah Arendt''.{{sfn|Zeitgeist|2015}} The ''New York Times'' designated it a New York Times critics pick.{{sfn|Scott|2016}} Of the many photographic portraits of Arendt, that taken in 1944 by [[Fred Stein]] (''see [[#Stein44|image]]''), whose work she greatly admired,{{efn|Arendt wrote to Stein \"It is my honest opinion that you are one of the best portrait photographers of the present day\"{{sfn|AIE|2018}}}} has become iconic, and has been described as better known than the photographer himself,{{sfn|Heinrich|2013}} having appeared on a German postage stamp.(''see [[#UNHCRStamp|image]]'') Among organizations that have recognized Arendt's contributions to civilization and human rights, is the [[United Nations Refugee Agency]] (UNHCR).{{sfn|UNHCR|2017}}\n\n=== Contemporary interest ===\n[[File:2014-08 Graffiti Patrik Wolters alias BeneR1 im Team mit Kevin Lasner alias koarts, Hannah Arendt-Haus am Lindener Marktplatz 2, Hannover-Linden-Mitte, Blick durch die Seiteneinfahrt in der Falkenstra\u00dfe.jpg|thumb|upright|Courtyard of Arendt's house in Linden-Mitte|alt=Photograph of the courtyard of the house in which she was born, showing Hannah with a cigarette in her hand and the inscription, attributed to her \"No one has the right to obey\", in German]]\nThe rise of [[nativism (politics)|nativism]], such as the election of [[Donald Trump]] in America,{{sfn|DP|2017}}{{sfn|Hill|2017}}{{sfn|Scroll|2017}} and concerns regarding an increasingly authoritarian style of governance has led to a surge of interest in Arendt and her writings, including{{sfn|Bernstein|2018}} radio broadcasts{{sfn|Bragg et al|2017}} and writers, including [[Jeremy Adelman]]{{sfn|Adelman|2016}} and Zoe Williams,{{sfn|Williams|2017}} to revisit Arendt's ideas to seek the extent to which they inform our understanding of such movements,{{sfn|Grenier|2017}}{{sfn|Coombes|2017|}} which are being described as \"Dark Times\".{{sfn|Bernstein|2018b}} At the same time [[Amazon (company)|Amazon]] reported that it had sold out of copies of ''The Origins of Totalitarianism'' (1951).{{sfn|Gold|2017}} [[Michiko Kakutani]] has addressed what she refers to as \"The Death of Truth\".{{sfn|Kakutani|2018}} In her book, she argues that the rise of totalitarianism has been founded on the violation of truth. She begins her book with an extensive quote from ''The Origins of Totalitarianism'':{{sfn|Arendt|1976}}\n\n<blockquote>The ideal subject of totalitarian rule is not the convinced Nazi or the convinced communist, but people for whom the distinction between fact and fiction (i.e., the reality of experience) and the distinction between true and false (i.e., the standards of thought) no longer exist{{sfn|Arendt|1976|loc=p.&nbsp;474}}{{sfn|Kakutani|2018|loc=p.&nbsp;1}}</blockquote>\n\nKakutani and others believed that Arendt's words speak not just events of a previous century but apply equally to the contemporary cultural landscape{{sfn|Bernstein|2018a}} populated with [[fake news]] and lies. She also draws on Arendt's essay \"Lying in Politics\" from ''Crises in the Republic''{{sfn|Arendt|1972}} pointing to the lines:\n\n<blockquote>The historian knows how vulnerable is the whole texture of facts in which we spend our daily life; it is always in danger of being perforated by single lies or torn to shreds by the organized lying of groups, nations, or classes, or denied and distorted, often carefully covered up by reams of falsehoods or simply allowed to fall into oblivion. Facts need testimony to be remembered and trustworthy witnesses to be established in order to find a secure dwelling place in the domain of human affairs{{sfn|Arendt|1972|loc=p.&nbsp;6}}</blockquote>\n\nArendt drew attention to the critical role that [[propaganda]] plays in [[gaslighting]] populations, Kakutani observes, citing the passage:{{sfn|Hayes|2018}}{{sfn|Kakutani|2018a}}\n\n<blockquote>In an ever-changing, incomprehensible world the masses had reached the point where they would, at the same time, believe everything and nothing, think that everything was possible and that nothing was true . ... The totalitarian mass leaders based their propaganda on the correct psychological assumption that, under such conditions, one could make people believe the most fantastic statements one day, and trust that if the next day they were given irrefutable proof of their falsehood, they would take refuge in cynicism; instead of deserting the leaders who had lied to them, they would protest that they had known all along that the statement was a lie and would admire the leaders for their superior tactical cleverness{{sfn|Arendt|1976|loc=p.&nbsp;382}}</blockquote>\n\nBut it is also relevant that Arendt took a broader perspective on history than merely totalitarianism in the early twentieth century, stating \"the deliberate falsehood and the outright lie have been used as legitimate means to achieve political ends since the beginning of recorded history\".{{sfn|Arendt|1972|loc=p.&nbsp;4}}{{sfn|Hanlon|2018}} Contemporary relevance is also reflected in the increasing use of the phrase, attributed to her, \"[[#Niemand hat das Recht zu gehorchen|No one has the right to obey]]\" to reflect that actions result from choices, and hence judgement, and that we cannot disclaim responsibility for that which we have the power to act upon.{{sfn|Invernizzi-Accetti|2017}} In addition those centers established to promote Arendtian studies continue to seek solutions to a wide range of contemporary issues in her writing.{{sfn|HAC|2018}}\n\nArendt's teachings on obedience have also been linked to the controversial psychology experiments by [[Stanley Milgram]], that implied that ordinary people can easily be induced to commit atrocities.{{sfn|Oatley|2018|loc=p.&nbsp;254}}{{sfn|Wolters|2013}} Milgram himself drew attention to this in 1974, stating that he was testing the theory that Eichmann like others would merely follow orders, but unlike Milgram she argued that actions involve responsibility.{{sfn|Milgram|2017|loc=p.&nbsp;23}}{{sfn|Berkowitz|2013a}}\n\nArendt's theories on the political consequences of how nations deal with refugees has remained relevant and compelling. Arendt had observed first hand the displacement of large stateless and rightsless populations, treated not so much as people in need than as problems to solve, and in many cases, resist.{{sfn|Scott|2016}} She wrote about this in her 1943 essay \"We refugees\".{{sfn|Arendt|1943}}{{sfn|Bhabha|Weigel|2018}} Another Arendtian theme that finds an echo in contemporary society is her observation, inspired by Rilke, of the despair of not being heard, the futility of tragedy that finds no listener that can bring comfort, assurance and intervention. An example of this being gun violence in America and the resulting political inaction.{{sfn|Hill|2015}}\n\n''In Search of the Last Agora'', an illustrated [[documentary film]] by Lebanese director Rayyan Dabbous about Hannah Arendt's 1958 work ''The Human Condition'', was released in 2018 to mark the book's 50th anniversary. Screened at Bard College, the experimental film is described as finding \"new meaning in the political theorist's conceptions of politics, technology and society in the 1950s\", particularly in her prediction of abuses of phenomena unknown in Arendt's time, including social media, intense globalization, and obsessive celebrity culture.{{sfn|Bard News|2018}}\n\n=== {{vanchor|Commemorations}} ===\n{{main|List of memorials to Hannah Arendt}}\nHannah Arendt's life and work continue to be commemorated in many different ways, including plaques (''Gedenktafeln'') indicating places she has lived.

The story, which follows a half-human who finds himself caught in the middle of two cultures, was informed by Gabe's experiences as a white-passing [[latinx]] person. The book was released in 2016 and received critical praise for its [[worldbuilding]]. It was followed by the sequels ''Into the Black'' (2017) and ''The Rising Gold'' (2018).\n\n==Plot==\nOn the fictional [[exoplanet]] of Safara, humans are second-class citizens, ruled over by a humanoid native species: the tall, tattooed Sepharon. The novels are written in first person, and switch back and forth between the perspectives of Kora and Eros. Kora is a young Sepharon, and the first female ruler of her province of Elja. Eros is a young half-human, half-Sepharon soldier who has grown up with nomadic \"redblood\" humans in a world where \"half-breeds\" like him are generally killed at birth.\n\n===''Beyond the Red''===\nAfter much of Eros's family and camp is killed in a Sepharon raid, Eros is captured and becomes Kora's personal servant and bodyguard. Even though Kora ordered the raid, the two find themselves developing feelings for each other, and Kora becomes increasingly sympathetic to the humans' cause.\n\nKora and Eros must contend with a coup by Kora's more militant brother Dima, who frames Kora for attempted murder and forces them to flee the province. They go beyond the red sands of their native region to the white-sanded capital city of Asheron. Kora's and Eros's feelings intensify, but Kora dithers on whether she wants a relationship with Eros, which leaves Eros feeling heartbroken.\n\nKora and Eros learn that Eros is actually the descendant of the previous Sira (the ruler of the planet), and that Eros is the rightful heir to the throne. They also learn that Roma, the current Sira, intends to wipe out all of humanity in a genocidal [[nanite]] attack. With the help of Roma's good-natured brother Serek, they are able to thwart Roma's plan and disable the world's nanites, but not before many humans die. In a climatic fight, Roma winds up in a permanent coma and Serek receives a fatal blow. In his dying moments, Serek announces to the world that Eros is heir to the throne.\n\n===''Into the Black''===\nAn emergency council is called. Former rulers from all over the planet meet in the capital city of Asheron, to determine whether a half-human can be permitted to become the next Sira. A DNA test confirms that Eros is the son of former Sira Asha, and Eros also has the golden eyes that mark the royal line. But Lejv, a cousin of Asha's, also vies for the position. Eros fears if the council does not recognize him as Sira, he will be executed, along with his blind and orphaned human nephew Mal, whom Eros has been looking after. Eros finds an ally in Deimos, a charismatic gay Sepharon bounty hunter and member of a royal family, and the two develop a flirtatious relationship.\n\nKora, meanwhile, learns that her region is in chaos and that her people are revolting against her draconian brother. She returns to Elja, her homeland, and convinces her brother to give power back to her, and forgives him for the coup that deposed her. To appease the people, she asks them to elect a populist representative who will work with her, and they pick a man named Uljen.\n\nBack at the capital, it is determined that Eros and Lejv must fight to the death for the role of Sira. Before the fight, Eros is jumped by anonymous attackers, who break his ribs and send him into a starry, black unconsciousness. He survives, and the council determines that the fight will continue, even though Eros is injured. Eros is ultimately able to subdue Lejv, but decides not to finish him with a killing blow. As Eros broke the rules of the match, the council seems poised to rule that Lejv should become the next Sira. But Eros finds a hidden message in a royal ring from the former Sira Asha, and in the message, Asha confirms that he wanted Eros to be the next-in-line. This is enough to sway the council to grudgingly grant Eros the title.\n\n===''The Rising Gold''===\nEros now rules the planet, and he must contend with the Remnant: a violent group of human activists led by Eros's ruthless biological mother Rani. As one of his first acts as Sira, Eros makes it illegal to enslave humans. But Rani and the Remnant demand more: they want the monarchy abolished and a democratic system put in place.\n\nMeanwhile, Deimos has become both Eros's top advisor and his boyfriend. As Eros has little sexual experience, and none with other men, the two take the relationship slowly. When Deimos catches an embarrassed Eros looking at gay pornography for research, the two become sexual with each other for the first time.\n\nIn her home territory of Ejos, Kora also develops a sexual relationship with her advisor Uljen. Meanwhile, Kora's twin brother Dima is tried for his various crimes and sentenced to death. Kora, who still loves her brother, is devastated. When she learns that Dima is escaping the city with the help of his boyfriend and former advisor Jarek, she chooses not to intervene.\n\nIn the capital city, the Remnant unleash a biological weapon: many Sepharon are infected with a deadly virus that humans (and half-humans like Eros) are immune to. The Remnant also kidnaps Eros's nephew Mal. Eros, Deimos, and a team of bodyguards are able to track down Mal and rescue him, and a team of Asheron scientists are able to develop a cure for the virus. Eros meets with Rani and negotiates a peace: he doesn't agree to abolish the monarchy, but does agree to a formation of a democratic human advisory council.\n\nThe future for humans seems brighter, but many humans still feel unwelcome on the planet, and, at Mal's suggestion, Eros offers them an option: he has his team of scientists restore the massive, ancient spaceship that humans arrived on the planet on many generations ago. Eros announces that humans who want to can board the ship and return to earth. To Eros's surprise, Mal decides he wants to join the expedition. Eros and Deimos hold hands and watch as the spaceship departs: a rising gold streak in the sky.\n\n==Development==\nGabe wrote the trilogy while a student in college<ref name=\"BL\" /> and graduate school.<ref name=\"youtube\" /> In an interview, he<ref name=\"pronouns\">{{Cite tweet |number=1184599516655345664 |user=thegabecole |title=Happy #PronounsDay!

The story, which follows a half-human who finds himself caught in the middle of two cultures, was informed by Gabe's experiences as a white-passing [[latinx]] person. The book was released in 2016 and received critical praise for its [[worldbuilding]]. It was followed by the sequels ''Into the Black'' (2017) and ''The Rising Gold'' (2018).\n\n==Plot==\nOn the fictional [[exoplanet]] of Safara, humans are second-class citizens, ruled over by a humanoid native species: the tall, tattooed Sepharon. The novels are written in first person, and switch back and forth between the perspectives of Kora and Eros. Kora is a young Sepharon, and the first female ruler of her province of Elja. Eros is a young half-human, half-Sepharon soldier who has grown up with nomadic \"redblood\" humans in a world where \"half-breeds\" like him are generally killed at birth.\n\n===''Beyond the Red''===\nAfter much of Eros's family and camp is killed in a Sepharon raid, Eros is captured and becomes Kora's personal servant and bodyguard. Even though Kora ordered the raid, the two find themselves developing feelings for each other, and Kora becomes increasingly sympathetic to the humans' cause.\n\nKora and Eros must contend with a coup by Kora's more militant brother Dima, who frames Kora for attempted murder and forces them to flee the province. They go beyond the red sands of their native region to the white-sanded capital city of Asheron. Kora's and Eros's feelings intensify, but Kora dithers on whether she wants a relationship with Eros, which leaves Eros feeling heartbroken.\n\nKora and Eros learn that Eros is actually the descendant of the previous Sira (the ruler of the planet), and that Eros is the rightful heir to the throne. They also learn that Roma, the current Sira, intends to wipe out all of humanity in a genocidal [[nanite]] attack. With the help of Roma's good-natured brother Serek, they are able to thwart Roma's plan and disable the world's nanites, but not before many humans die. In a climatic fight, Roma winds up in a permanent coma and Serek receives a fatal blow. In his dying moments, Serek announces to the world that Eros is heir to the throne.\n\n===''Into the Black''===\nAn emergency council is called. Former rulers from all over the planet meet in the capital city of Asheron, to determine whether a half-human can be permitted to become the next Sira. A DNA test confirms that Eros is the son of former Sira Asha, and Eros also has the golden eyes that mark the royal line. But Lejv, a cousin of Asha's, also vies for the position. Eros fears if the council does not recognize him as Sira, he will be executed, along with his blind and orphaned human nephew Mal, whom Eros has been looking after. Eros finds an ally in Deimos, a charismatic gay Sepharon bounty hunter and member of a royal family, and the two develop a flirtatious relationship.\n\nKora, meanwhile, learns that her region is in chaos and that her people are revolting against her draconian brother. She returns to Elja, her homeland, and convinces her brother to give power back to her, and forgives him for the coup that deposed her. To appease the people, she asks them to elect a populist representative who will work with her, and they pick a man named Uljen.\n\nBack at the capital, it is determined that Eros and Lejv must fight to the death for the role of Sira. Before the fight, Eros is jumped by anonymous attackers, who break his ribs and send him into a starry, black unconsciousness. He survives, and the council determines that the fight will continue, even though Eros is injured. Eros is ultimately able to subdue Lejv, but decides not to finish him with a killing blow. As Eros broke the rules of the match, the council seems poised to rule that Lejv should become the next Sira. But Eros finds a hidden message in a royal ring from the former Sira Asha, and in the message, Asha confirms that he wanted Eros to be the next-in-line. This is enough to sway the council to grudgingly grant Eros the title.\n\n===''The Rising Gold''===\nEros now rules the planet, and he must contend with the Remnant: a violent group of human activists led by Eros's ruthless biological mother Rani. As one of his first acts as Sira, Eros makes it illegal to enslave humans. But Rani and the Remnant demand more: they want the monarchy abolished and a democratic system put in place.\n\nMeanwhile, Deimos has become both Eros's top advisor and his boyfriend. As Eros has little sexual experience, and none with other men, the two take the relationship slowly. When Deimos catches an embarrassed Eros looking at gay pornography for research, the two become sexual with each other for the first time.\n\nIn her home territory of Ejos, Kora also develops a sexual relationship with her advisor Uljen. Meanwhile, Kora's twin brother Dima is tried for his various crimes and sentenced to death. Kora, who still loves her brother, is devastated. When she learns that Dima is escaping the city with the help of his boyfriend and former advisor Jarek, she chooses not to intervene.\n\nIn the capital city, the Remnant unleash a biological weapon: many Sepharon are infected with a deadly virus that humans (and half-humans like Eros) are immune to. The Remnant also kidnaps Eros's nephew Mal. Eros, Deimos, and a team of bodyguards are able to track down Mal and rescue him, and a team of Asheron scientists are able to develop a cure for the virus. Eros meets with Rani and negotiates a peace: he doesn't agree to abolish the monarchy, but does agree to a formation of a democratic human advisory council.\n\nThe future for humans seems brighter, but many humans still feel unwelcome on the planet, and, at Mal's suggestion, Eros offers them an option: he has his team of scientists restore the massive, ancient spaceship that humans arrived on the planet on many generations ago. Eros announces that humans who want to can board the ship and return to earth. To Eros's surprise, Mal decides he wants to join the expedition. Eros and Deimos hold hands and watch as the spaceship departs: a rising gold streak in the sky.\n\n==Development==\nGabe wrote the trilogy while a student in college<ref name=\"BL\" /> and graduate school.<ref name=\"youtube\" /> In an interview, he<ref name=\"pronouns\">{{Cite tweet |number=1184599516655345664 |user=thegabecole |title=Happy #PronounsDay!

This term is used to describe the relationships between communities and [[State (polity)|states]] and how they were created by the geographical spread of ideas and social norms at both local and regional levels.<ref name=\"M 45\">{{cite book|last=Martell|first=Luke|title=The Sociology of Globalization|year=2010|publisher=Policy Press.}}</ref>\n\nIn this schema, three main prerequisites are posited for globalization to occur. The first is the idea of Eastern Origins, which shows how [[Western world|Western states]] have adapted and implemented learned principles from the [[Eastern world|East]].<ref name=\"M 45\"/> Without the spread of traditional ideas from the East, Western globalization would not have emerged the way it did. The second is distance. The interactions of states were not on a global scale and most often were confined to Asia, [[North Africa]], the [[Middle East]], and certain parts of Europe.<ref name=\"M 45\"/> With early globalization, it was difficult for states to interact with others that were not within a close proximity. Eventually, technological advances allowed states to learn of others' existence and thus another phase of globalization can occur. The third has to do with inter-dependency, stability, and regularity. If a state is not dependent on another, then there is no way for either state to be mutually affected by the other. This is one of the driving forces behind global connections and trade; without either, globalization would not have emerged the way it did and states would still be dependent on their own [[Production (economics)|production]] and resources to work. This is one of the arguments surrounding the idea of early globalization. It is argued that archaic globalization did not function in a similar manner to modern globalization because states were not as interdependent on others as they are today.<ref name=\"M 45\"/>\n\nAlso posited is a \"multi-polar\" nature to archaic globalization, which involved the active participation of non-Europeans. Because it predated the [[Great Divergence]] in the nineteenth century, where [[Western Europe]] pulled ahead of the rest of the world in terms of [[industrial production]] and [[Output (economics)|economic output]], archaic globalization was a phenomenon that was driven not only by Europe but also by other economically developed [[Old World]] centers such as [[Gujarat]], [[Bengal]], coastal [[China]], and [[Japan]].<ref>{{cite book|last=[[Hans K\u00f6chler|Kochler]]|first=Hans|title=Globality versus Democracy: The Changing Nature of International Relations in the Era of Globalization|year=2000|publisher=International Progress Organization|location=Vienna|page=35}}</ref>\n[[File:NanbanCarrack.jpg|thumb|right|Portuguese [[carrack]] in [[Nagasaki]], 17th-century Japanese [[Nanban trade|Nanban art]]]]\n\nThe German [[Economic history|historical economist]] and sociologist [[Andre Gunder Frank]] argues that a form of globalization began with the rise of trade links between [[Sumer]] and the [[Indus Valley Civilization]] in the third millennium [[Common Era|BCE]].  This archaic globalization existed during the [[Hellenistic civilization|Hellenistic Age]], when commercialized urban centers enveloped the axis of [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] culture that reached from [[India]] to [[Spain]], including [[Alexandria]] and the other [[Alexander the Great|Alexandrine]] cities. Early on, the geographic position of Greece and the necessity of [[import]]ing wheat forced the Greeks to engage in maritime trade.

The concept of \"proto-globalization\" was first introduced by [[historian]]s [[A. G. Hopkins]] and [[Christopher Bayly]]. The term describes the phase of increasing trade links and cultural exchange that characterized the period immediately preceding the advent of high \"modern globalization\" in the late 19th century.<ref>Hopkins, A.G., ed., 2003. Globalization in World History. New York City: Norton. {{ISBN|0-393-97942-3}} pp. 4\u20135, 7</ref> This phase of globalization was characterized by the rise of maritime European empires, in the 15th and 17th centuries, first the [[Portuguese Empire]] (1415) followed by the [[Spanish Empire]] (1492), and later the [[Dutch Empire|Dutch]] and [[British Empire]]s. In the 17th century, world trade developed further when [[Chartered company|chartered companies]] like the [[British East India Company]] (founded in 1600) and the [[Dutch East India Company]] (founded in 1602, often described as the first [[multinational corporation]] in which [[stock]] was offered) were established.<ref>Chaudhuri, K.N.

London: Routledge/Thoemmes Press.</ref>\n\nEarly modern globalization is distinguished from modern globalization on the basis of [[expansionism]], the method of managing global trade, and the level of information exchange. The period is marked by such trade arrangements as the [[East India Company]], the shift of [[hegemony]] to Western Europe, the rise of larger-scale conflicts between powerful nations such as the [[Thirty Years' War]], and the rise of newfound commodities\u2014most particularly [[slave trade]]. [[The Triangular Trade]] made it possible for Europe to take advantage of resources within the [[Western Hemisphere]]. The transfer of animal stocks, plant crops, and epidemic diseases associated with [[Alfred W. Crosby]]'s concept of the [[Columbian Exchange]] also played a central role in this process. European, [[Muslim]], Indian, [[Southeast Asia]]n, and Chinese merchants were all involved in early modern trade and communications, particularly in the Indian Ocean region.\n\n[[File:Launch-of-the-SS-GB.jpg|thumb|The 1843 launch of the ''[[SS Great Britain|Great Britain]]'', the revolutionary ship of [[Isambard Kingdom Brunel]]]]\n[[File:Arthur Mees Flags of A Free Empire 1910 Cornell CUL PJM 1167 01.jpg|thumb|During the 19th and early 20th centuries, the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom]] was a global superpower.]]\n\n===Modern===\nAccording to economic historians Kevin H.

[[Industrialisation|Industrialization]] allowed [[standardization|standardized]] production of household items using [[economies of scale]] while rapid [[population growth]] created sustained [[demand]] for commodities. In the 19th century, steamships reduced the cost of international transport significantly and [[railroads]] made inland transportation cheaper. The transport revolution occurred some time between 1820 and 1850.<ref name=\"When Did Globalization Begin\" /> More nations embraced [[international trade]].<ref name=\"When Did Globalization Begin\" /> Globalization in this period was decisively shaped by nineteenth-century [[imperialism]] such as in [[Scramble for Africa|Africa]] and [[Western imperialism in Asia|Asia]].

Initially, the [[General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade]] (GATT) led to a series of agreements to remove trade restrictions. GATT's successor was the [[World Trade Organization]] (WTO), which provided a framework for negotiating and formalizing trade agreements and a dispute resolution process.

This has added to processes of commodity exchange and colonization which have a longer history of carrying cultural meaning around the globe. The circulation of cultures enables individuals to partake in extended social relations that cross national and regional borders. The creation and expansion of such social relations is not merely observed on a material level. Cultural globalization involves the formation of shared norms and knowledge with which people associate their individual and collective cultural identities. It brings increasing interconnectedness among different populations and cultures.<ref>Manfred B. Steger and Paul James, \u2018Ideologies of Globalism\u2019, in Paul James and Manfred B.

Cultural practices including traditional music can be lost or turned into a fusion of traditions. Globalization can trigger a state of emergency for the preservation of musical heritage. Archivists may attempt to collect, record, or transcribe repertoires before melodies are assimilated or modified, while local musicians may struggle for [[authenticity in art|authenticity]] and to preserve local musical traditions. Globalization can lead performers to discard traditional instruments.

Musically, this translates into each individual having their own musical identity based on likes and tastes. These likes and tastes are greatly influenced by culture, as this is the most basic cause for a person's wants and behavior. The concept of one's own culture is now in a period of change due to globalization. Also, globalization has increased the interdependency of political, personal, cultural, and economic factors.<ref>Beard, David and Keneth Gloag. 2005. Musicology: The Key Concepts.

In 2002, China was the third largest exporter of cultural goods, after the UK and US. Between 1994 and 2002, both North America's and the [[European Union]]'s shares of cultural exports declined while Asia's cultural exports grew to surpass North America. Related factors are the fact that Asia's population and area are several times that of North America. Americanization is related to a period of high political American clout and of significant growth of America's shops, markets and objects being brought into other countries.\n\nSome critics of globalization argue that it harms the diversity of cultures. As a dominating country's culture is introduced into a receiving country through globalization, it can become a threat to the diversity of local culture. Some argue that globalization may ultimately lead to [[Westernization]] or Americanization of culture, where the dominating cultural concepts of economically and politically powerful Western countries spread and cause harm to local cultures.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://aleteia.org/2018/04/11/why-do-we-need-religion-in-a-globalized-world/|title=Why do we need religion in a globalized world?|date=11 April 2018|work=Aleteia \u2014 Catholic Spirituality, Lifestyle, World News, and Culture|access-date=12 April 2018|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\nGlobalization is a diverse phenomenon which relates to a multilateral political world and to the increase of cultural objects and markets between countries.

In particular, in East Asian developing countries, [[GDP]] per head rose at 5.9% a year from 1975 to 2001 (according to 2003 [[Human Development Report]]<ref>{{cite web|year=2003|url= http://hdr.undp.org/en/media/hdr03_complete.pdf|title=Human Development Report 2003|publisher=UNDP|accessdate=6 April 2013}}</ref> of UNDP). Like this, the British economic journalist [[Martin Wolf]] says that incomes of poor developing countries, with more than half the world's population, grew substantially faster than those of the world's richest countries that remained relatively stable in its growth, leading to reduced international inequality and the incidence of poverty.\n\n[[File:Berg Ostry 2011 Chart 4.gif|thumb|left|Of the factors influencing the duration of [[economic growth]] in both developed and developing countries, [[Economic inequality|income equality]] has a more beneficial impact than trade openness, sound political institutions, and foreign investment.<ref name=BergOstryEE>{{Cite journal |last= Berg |first= Andrew G. |last2= Ostry |first2= Jonathan D. |year= 2011 |title= Equality and Efficiency |journal= Finance and Development |volume= 48 |issue= 3 |url= http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/fandd/2011/09/berg.htm |accessdate= 10 September 2012}}</ref>]]\nCertain demographic changes in the developing world after active [[economic liberalization]] and international integration resulted in rising general welfare and, hence, reduced inequality. According to Wolf, in the developing world as a whole, life expectancy rose by four months each year after 1970 and infant mortality rate declined from 107 per thousand in 1970 to 58 in 2000 due to improvements in [[standards of living]] and health conditions. Also, adult literacy in developing countries rose from 53% in 1970 to 74% in 1998 and much lower illiteracy rate among the young guarantees that rates will continue to fall as time passes. Furthermore, the reduction in [[fertility rate]] in the developing world as a whole from 4.1 births per woman in 1980 to 2.8 in 2000 indicates improved education level of women on fertility, and control of fewer children with more parental attention and investment.<ref name=\"Wolf2004\">{{cite book|url= https://archive.org/details/whyglobalization00wolf|title= Why Globalization Works|publisher= [[Yale University Press]]|author= Martin Wolf|year= 2004|isbn= 978-0-300-10252-9|accessdate= 6 April 2013|df= dmy-all}}{{dead link|date=January 2019|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref> Consequently, more prosperous and educated parents with fewer children have chosen to withdraw their children from the labor force to give them opportunities to be educated at school improving the issue of [[child labor]].

This acceleration in growth seems even more remarkable given that the rich countries saw steady declines in growth from a high of 4.7 percent in the 1960s to 2.2 percent in the 1990s. Also, the non-globalizing developing countries seem to fare worse than the globalizers, with the former's annual growth rates falling from highs of 3.3 percent during the 1970s to only 1.4 percent during the 1990s.

For him, our epoch is determined by a social phenomenon: the revolt of the elites, in reference to ''The revolt of the masses'' (1929) of the Spanish philosopher Jos\u00e9 Ortega y Gasset. According to Lasch, the new elites, i.e. those who are in the top 20% in terms of income, through globalization which allows total mobility of capital, no longer live in the same world as their fellow-citizens. In this, they oppose the old bourgeoisie of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, which was constrained by its spatial stability to a minimum of rooting and civic obligations. Globalization, according to the sociologist, has turned elites into tourists in their own countries. The denationalization of business enterprise tends to produce a class who see themselves as \"world citizens, but without accepting ... any of the obligations that citizenship in a polity normally implies\". Their ties to an international culture of work, leisure, information \u2013 make many of them deeply indifferent to the prospect of national decline. Instead of financing public services and the public treasury, new elites are investing their money in improving their voluntary ghettos: private schools in their residential neighborhoods, private police, garbage collection systems. They have \"withdrawn from common life\".\nComposed of those who control the international flows of capital and information, who preside over philanthropic foundations and institutions of higher education, manage the instruments of cultural production and thus fix the terms of public debate. So, the political debate is limited mainly to the dominant classes and political ideologies lose all contact with the concerns of the ordinary citizen. The result of this is that no one has a likely solution to these problems and that there are furious ideological battles on related issues.\nHowever, they remain protected from the problems affecting the working classes: the decline of industrial activity, the resulting loss of employment, the decline of the middle class, increasing the number of the poor, the rising crime rate, growing drug trafficking, the urban crisis.\n\nD.A.

This term is used to describe the relationships between communities and [[State (polity)|states]] and how they were created by the geographical spread of ideas and social norms at both local and regional levels.<ref name=\"M 45\">{{cite book|last=Martell|first=Luke|title=The Sociology of Globalization|year=2010|publisher=Policy Press.}}</ref>\n\nIn this schema, three main prerequisites are posited for globalization to occur. The first is the idea of Eastern Origins, which shows how [[Western world|Western states]] have adapted and implemented learned principles from the [[Eastern world|East]].<ref name=\"M 45\"/> Without the spread of traditional ideas from the East, Western globalization would not have emerged the way it did. The second is distance. The interactions of states were not on a global scale and most often were confined to Asia, [[North Africa]], the [[Middle East]], and certain parts of Europe.<ref name=\"M 45\"/> With early globalization, it was difficult for states to interact with others that were not within a close proximity. Eventually, technological advances allowed states to learn of others' existence and thus another phase of globalization can occur. The third has to do with inter-dependency, stability, and regularity. If a state is not dependent on another, then there is no way for either state to be mutually affected by the other. This is one of the driving forces behind global connections and trade; without either, globalization would not have emerged the way it did and states would still be dependent on their own [[Production (economics)|production]] and resources to work. This is one of the arguments surrounding the idea of early globalization. It is argued that archaic globalization did not function in a similar manner to modern globalization because states were not as interdependent on others as they are today.<ref name=\"M 45\"/>\n\nAlso posited is a \"multi-polar\" nature to archaic globalization, which involved the active participation of non-Europeans. Because it predated the [[Great Divergence]] in the nineteenth century, where [[Western Europe]] pulled ahead of the rest of the world in terms of [[industrial production]] and [[Output (economics)|economic output]], archaic globalization was a phenomenon that was driven not only by Europe but also by other economically developed [[Old World]] centers such as [[Gujarat]], [[Bengal]], coastal [[China]], and [[Japan]].<ref>{{cite book|last=[[Hans K\u00f6chler|Kochler]]|first=Hans|title=Globality versus Democracy: The Changing Nature of International Relations in the Era of Globalization|year=2000|publisher=International Progress Organization|location=Vienna|page=35}}</ref>\n[[File:NanbanCarrack.jpg|thumb|right|Portuguese [[carrack]] in [[Nagasaki]], 17th-century Japanese [[Nanban trade|Nanban art]]]]\n\nThe German [[Economic history|historical economist]] and sociologist [[Andre Gunder Frank]] argues that a form of globalization began with the rise of trade links between [[Sumer]] and the [[Indus Valley Civilization]] in the third millennium [[Common Era|BCE]].

In the 17th century, world trade developed further when [[Chartered company|chartered companies]] like the [[British East India Company]] (founded in 1600) and the [[Dutch East India Company]] (founded in 1602, often described as the first [[multinational corporation]] in which [[stock]] was offered) were established.<ref>Chaudhuri, K.N.

The period is marked by such trade arrangements as the [[East India Company]], the shift of [[hegemony]] to Western Europe, the rise of larger-scale conflicts between powerful nations such as the [[Thirty Years' War]], and the rise of newfound commodities\u2014most particularly [[slave trade]]. [[The Triangular Trade]] made it possible for Europe to take advantage of resources within the [[Western Hemisphere]]. The transfer of animal stocks, plant crops, and epidemic diseases associated with [[Alfred W. Crosby]]'s concept of the [[Columbian Exchange]] also played a central role in this process.

Between 1994 and 2002, both North America's and the [[European Union]]'s shares of cultural exports declined while Asia's cultural exports grew to surpass North America. Related factors are the fact that Asia's population and area are several times that of North America. Americanization is related to a period of high political American clout and of significant growth of America's shops, markets and objects being brought into other countries.\n\nSome critics of globalization argue that it harms the diversity of cultures. As a dominating country's culture is introduced into a receiving country through globalization, it can become a threat to the diversity of local culture. Some argue that globalization may ultimately lead to [[Westernization]] or Americanization of culture, where the dominating cultural concepts of economically and politically powerful Western countries spread and cause harm to local cultures.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://aleteia.org/2018/04/11/why-do-we-need-religion-in-a-globalized-world/|title=Why do we need religion in a globalized world?|date=11 April 2018|work=Aleteia \u2014 Catholic Spirituality, Lifestyle, World News, and Culture|access-date=12 April 2018|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\nGlobalization is a diverse phenomenon which relates to a multilateral political world and to the increase of cultural objects and markets between countries.

Also, adult literacy in developing countries rose from 53% in 1970 to 74% in 1998 and much lower illiteracy rate among the young guarantees that rates will continue to fall as time passes.

For him, our epoch is determined by a social phenomenon: the revolt of the elites, in reference to ''The revolt of the masses'' (1929) of the Spanish philosopher Jos\u00e9 Ortega y Gasset. According to Lasch, the new elites, i.e. those who are in the top 20% in terms of income, through globalization which allows total mobility of capital, no longer live in the same world as their fellow-citizens. In this, they oppose the old bourgeoisie of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, which was constrained by its spatial stability to a minimum of rooting and civic obligations. Globalization, according to the sociologist, has turned elites into tourists in their own countries. The denationalization of business enterprise tends to produce a class who see themselves as \"world citizens, but without accepting ... any of the obligations that citizenship in a polity normally implies\". Their ties to an international culture of work, leisure, information \u2013 make many of them deeply indifferent to the prospect of national decline. Instead of financing public services and the public treasury, new elites are investing their money in improving their voluntary ghettos: private schools in their residential neighborhoods, private police, garbage collection systems. They have \"withdrawn from common life\".\nComposed of those who control the international flows of capital and information, who preside over philanthropic foundations and institutions of higher education, manage the instruments of cultural production and thus fix the terms of public debate. So, the political debate is limited mainly to the dominant classes and political ideologies lose all contact with the concerns of the ordinary citizen. The result of this is that no one has a likely solution to these problems and that there are furious ideological battles on related issues.\nHowever, they remain protected from the problems affecting the working classes: the decline of industrial activity, the resulting loss of employment, the decline of the middle class, increasing the number of the poor, the rising crime rate, growing drug trafficking, the urban crisis.\n\nD.A. Snow et al. contend that the [[anti-globalization movement]] is an example of a [[new social movement]], which uses tactics that are unique and use different resources than previously used before in other social movements.<ref>Snow, D.A., Soule, S.A., & Kriesi, H.

Increasing integration of these [[financial market]]s between countries leads to the emergence of a global capital marketplace or a single world market. In the long run, increased movement of capital between countries tends to favor owners of capital more than any other group; in the short run, owners and workers in specific sectors in capital-exporting countries bear much of the burden of adjusting to increased movement of capital.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Invested Interests: The Politics of National Economic Policies in a World of Global Finance|last=Frieden|first=Jeffry A.|journal=[[International Organization]]|issn=1531-5088|volume=45|issue=4|year=1991|pages=425\u201351|doi=10.1017/s0020818300033178|jstor=2706944}}</ref>\n\nThose opposed to capital market integration on the basis of [[human rights]] issues are especially disturbed{{According to whom?|date=March 2020}} by the various abuses which they think are perpetuated by global and international institutions that, they say, promote [[neoliberalism]] without regard to ethical standards.

In her book ''[[Ancient Futures: Learning from Ladakh|Ancient Futures]]'', Norberg-Hodge claims that \"centuries of ecological balance and social harmony are under threat from the pressures of development and globalization.\" She also criticizes the standardization and rationalization of globalization, as it does not always yield the expected growth outcomes. Although globalization takes similar steps in most countries, scholars such as Hodge claim that it might not be effective to certain countries and that globalization has actually moved some countries backward instead of developing them.<ref>{{cite book|last=Norberg-Hodge|first=Helena|title=Ancient futures : learning from Ladakh|year=1992|publisher=Sierra Club Books|location=San Francisco|isbn=978-0-87156-643-0|edition=Sierra Club Books paperback|url=https://archive.org/details/ancientfuturesl000norb}}</ref>\n\nA related area of concern is the [[pollution haven hypothesis]], which posits that, when large industrialized nations seek to set up factories or offices abroad, they will often look for the cheapest option in terms of resources and labor that offers the land and material access they require (see [[Race to the bottom]]).<ref name=\"Unmaskingthe\">{{cite journal|last=Levinson|first=Arik|author2=M.

[[Seattle SuperSonics]] owner [[Sam Schulman]] signed Haywood to a six-year, $1.5 million contract, ignoring the rule that a player cannot join the league until he is four years out of high school. As a result, the NBA threatened to disallow the contract and implement various\nsanctions against the SuperSonics.\n\n==Procedural history==\nHaywood challenged this decision by commencing an antitrust action against the NBA. As part of his claim against the NBA, Haywood argued that the conduct of the NBA was a \"group boycott\" and a violation of the [[Sherman Antitrust Act]]. The central issue that had to be determined was whether the NBA draft policy was a restraint on trade and therefore was illegal in accordance with the Sherman Act.\n\nThe case was filed in the [[United States District Court for the Central District of California]], which issued an [[injunction]] in Haywood's favor, ruling:\n{{Quote|If Haywood is unable to continue to play professional basketball for Seattle, he will suffer irreparable injury in that a substantial part of his playing career will have been dissipated, his physical condition, skills, and coordination will deteriorate from lack of high-level competition, his public acceptance as a super star will diminish to the detriment of his career, his self-esteem, and his pride will have been injured and a great injustice will be perpetrated on him.}}\n\nThe NBA appealed to the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit|Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals]], which stayed the injunction. Joined by the SuperSonics, Haywood appealed to the Supreme Court, which upheld the District Court, reinstated that court's injunction against the NBA, and remanded the case to the District Court for further proceedings.\n\n==Impact==\nShortly after the Supreme Court's decision, the league and Haywood reached an out-of-court settlement which allowed him to stay with the Sonics permanently.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://hoopshype.com/articles/america_friedman.htm |title=Excerpt, \"Chocolate Thunder and Short Shorts: The NBA in the 1970s\" |work=Basketball in America: From the Playgrounds to Jordan's Game and Beyond |first=David |last=Friedman |date=2005-04-18 |accessdate=2008-11-13 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080908045014/http://hoopshype.com/articles/america_friedman.htm |archivedate=2008-09-08 }}</ref>\n\nThe decision allowed a significant number of high school graduates and college attendees to make themselves eligible for the [[NBA Draft]] before completing four years in college.\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of United States Supreme Court cases, volume 401]]\n*''[[Toolson v.

There were also allegations that he had allowed [[Khalistan movement|Khalistan]] terrorist groups to train in Jammu province, although those allegations were never proved. On 2 July 1984, [[Ghulam Mohammad Shah|G. M.

Many incidents were reported in various areas where Kashmiri Hindus were killed and their properties and temples damaged or destroyed. The worst hit areas were mainly in South Kashmir and Sopore. In Vanpoh, Lukbhavan, Anantnag, Salar and Fatehpur, Muslim mobs plundered or destroyed the properties and temples of Hindus.

Shah called in the army to curb the violence, but it had little effect. His government was dismissed on 12 March 1986, by the then Governor [[Jagmohan]] following communal riots in south Kashmir.

They have not done so because the situation in the Valley remains unstable and they fear a risk to their lives. Most of them lost their properties after the exodus and many are unable to go back and sell them. Their status as displaced people has adversely harmed them in the realm of education. Many Hindu families could not afford to send their children to well regarded public schools. Furthermore, Hindus faced institutional discrimination by predominantly Muslim state bureaucrats. As a result of the inadequate ad hoc schools and colleges formed in the refugee camps, it became harder for the children of Hindus to access education. They suffered in higher education as well, as they could not claim admission in PG colleges of Jammu university, while getting admitted in the institutes of Kashmir valley was out of question.

Many incidents were reported in various areas where Kashmiri Hindus were killed and their properties and temples damaged or destroyed. The worst hit areas were mainly in South Kashmir and Sopore. In Vanpoh, Lukbhavan, Anantnag, Salar and Fatehpur, Muslim mobs plundered or destroyed the properties and temples of Hindus.

Shah called in the army to curb the violence, but it had little effect. His government was dismissed on 12 March 1986, by the then Governor [[Jagmohan]] following communal riots in south Kashmir. This led Jagmohan to rule the state directly.

They have not done so because the situation in the Valley remains unstable and they fear a risk to their lives. Most of them lost their properties after the exodus and many are unable to go back and sell them. Their status as displaced people has adversely harmed them in the realm of education. Many Hindu families could not afford to send their children to well regarded public schools. Furthermore, Hindus faced institutional discrimination by predominantly Muslim state bureaucrats. As a result of the inadequate ad hoc schools and colleges formed in the refugee camps, it became harder for the children of Hindus to access education. They suffered in higher education as well, as they could not claim admission in PG colleges of Jammu university, while getting admitted in the institutes of Kashmir valley was out of question.

During the 15th and 16th centuries, clockmaking flourished. The next development in accuracy occurred after 1656 with the invention of the [[pendulum clock]] by [[Christiaan Huygens]]. A major stimulus to improving the accuracy and reliability of clocks was the importance of precise time-keeping for navigation. The [[electric clock]] was patented in 1840. The development of [[electronics]] in the 20th century led to clocks with no clockwork parts at all.\n\nThe timekeeping element in every modern clock is a [[harmonic oscillator]], a physical object ([[resonator]]) that vibrates or [[oscillate]]s at a particular [[frequency]].<ref name=\"Marrison\" />\nThis object can be a [[pendulum]], a [[tuning fork]], a [[crystal oscillator|quartz crystal]], or the vibration of [[electron]]s in [[atom]]s as they emit [[microwave]]s.\n\nClocks have different ways of displaying the time. Analog clocks indicate time with a traditional [[clock face]], with moving hands. Digital clocks display a numeric representation of time. Two numbering systems are in use; [[24-hour time]] notation and 12-hour notation. Most digital clocks use electronic mechanisms and [[LCD]], [[LED]], or [[Vacuum fluorescent display|VFD]] displays. For the blind and use over telephones, [[speaking clock]]s state the time audibly in words.  There are also clocks for the blind that have displays that can be read by touch. The study of timekeeping is known as [[horology]].\n\n==Etymology==\nThe word ''clock'' derives from the medieval [[Latin]] word for \"bell\"; ''clogga'', and has [[cognate]]s in many European languages.

Examples of such duration timers are [[candle clock]]s, [[incense clock]]s and the [[hourglass]]. Both the candle clock and the incense clock work on the same principle wherein the consumption of resources is more or less constant allowing reasonably precise and repeatable estimates of time passages. In the hourglass, fine [[sand]] pouring through a tiny hole at a constant rate indicates an arbitrary, predetermined, passage of time. The resource is not consumed but re-used.\n\n===Water clocks===\n{{main|Water clock}}\n[[File:MandalayWaterClock.jpg|thumb|upright|A water clock for [[goldbeating]] [[goldleaf]] in [[Mandalay]] ([[Myanmar]]).]]\n\nWater clocks, also known as clepsydrae (sg: ''clepsydra''), along with the sundials, are possibly the oldest time-measuring instruments, with the only exceptions being the vertical [[gnomon]] and the day counting [[tally stick]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Turner|1984|p=1}}</ref> Given their great antiquity, where and when they first existed is not known and perhaps unknowable.

These advances were passed on through [[Byzantium]] and [[Islamic]] times, eventually making their way back to [[Europe]]. Independently, the Chinese developed their own advanced water clocks\uff08\u6c34\u9418\uff09in 725 AD, passing their ideas on to [[Korea]] and [[Japan]].\n\nSome water clock designs were developed independently and some knowledge was transferred through the spread of trade. [[Pre-modern]] societies do not have the same precise timekeeping requirements that exist in modern [[industrialism|industrial]] societies, where every hour of work or rest is monitored, and work may start or finish at any time regardless of external conditions. Instead, water clocks in ancient societies were used mainly for [[astrology|astrological]] reasons. These early water clocks were calibrated with a [[sundial]]. While never reaching the level of accuracy of a modern timepiece, the water clock was the most accurate and commonly used timekeeping device for millennia, until it was replaced by the more accurate [[pendulum clock]] in 17th-century Europe.\n\nIslamic civilization is credited with further advancing the accuracy of clocks with elaborate engineering.

Existing clock mechanisms that used [[Hydropower|water power]] were being adapted to take their driving power from falling weights. This power was controlled by some form of oscillating mechanism, probably derived from existing bell-ringing or alarm devices. This controlled release of power\u2014the [[escapement]]\u2014marks the beginning of the true mechanical clock, which differed from the previously mentioned cogwheel clocks. [[Verge escapement]] mechanism derived in the surge of true mechanical clocks, which didn't need any kind of fluid power, like water or mercury, to work.\n\nThese mechanical clocks were intended for two main purposes: for signalling and notification (e.g. the timing of services and public events), and for modeling the [[solar system]]. The former purpose is administrative, the latter arises naturally given the scholarly interests in astronomy, science, astrology, and how these subjects integrated with the religious philosophy of the time. The [[astrolabe]] was used both by astronomers and astrologers, and it was natural to apply a clockwork drive to the rotating plate to produce a working model of the solar system.\n\nSimple clocks intended mainly for notification were installed in towers, and did not always require faces or hands. They would have announced the [[canonical hours]] or intervals between set times of prayer. Canonical hours varied in length as the times of sunrise and sunset shifted. The more sophisticated astronomical clocks would have had moving dials or hands, and would have shown the time in various time systems, including [[Hour#Counting from sunset|Italian hours]], canonical hours, and time as measured by astronomers at the time. Both styles of clock started acquiring extravagant features such as [[automata]].\n\nIn 1283, a large clock was installed at [[Dunstable Priory]]; its location above the [[rood screen]] suggests that it was not a water clock.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.crystalinks.com/clocks.html|title=Clocks{{Snd}} Crystalinks|website=www.crystalinks.com|access-date=2019-06-06}}</ref> In 1292, [[Canterbury Cathedral]] installed a 'great horloge'.

[[Galileo Galilei|Galileo]] had the idea to use a swinging bob to regulate the motion of a time-telling device earlier in the 17th century. [[Christiaan Huygens]], however, is usually credited as the inventor. He determined the mathematical formula that related pendulum length to time (about 99.4&nbsp;cm or 39.1&nbsp;inches for the one second movement) and had the first pendulum-driven clock made. The first model clock was built in 1657 in [[the Hague]], but it was in [[England]] that the idea was taken up.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.historyworld.net/wrldhis/PlainTextHistories.asp?groupid=2324&HistoryID=ac08&gtrack=pthc|title=History of Clocks}}</ref> The [[longcase clock]] (also known as the ''grandfather clock'') was created to house the pendulum and works by the English clockmaker William Clement in 1670 or 1671.

The position of a ship at sea could be determined with reasonable accuracy if a navigator could refer to a clock that lost or gained less than about 10 seconds per day. This clock could not contain a pendulum, which would be virtually useless on a rocking ship.

The electric clock's mainspring is wound either with an [[electric motor]] or with an [[electromagnet]] and armature. In 1841, he first patented the [[Electromagnetism|electromagnetic]] pendulum. By the end of the nineteenth century, the advent of the dry cell battery made it feasible to use electric power in clocks. Spring or weight driven clocks that use electricity, either [[alternating current]] (AC) or [[direct current]] (DC), to rewind the spring or raise the weight of a mechanical clock would be classified as an [[electromechanical clock]]. This classification would also apply to clocks that employ an electrical impulse to propel the pendulum. In electromechanical clocks the electricity serves no time keeping function. These types of clocks were made as individual timepieces but more commonly used in synchronized time installations in schools, businesses, factories, railroads and government facilities as a [[master clock]] and [[slave clocks]].\n\nElectric clocks that are powered from the [[Alternating current|AC]] supply often use [[synchronous motor]]s. The supply current alternates with a frequency of 50&nbsp;[[hertz]] in many countries, and 60&nbsp;hertz in others. The [[Rotor (electric)|rotor]] of the motor rotates at a speed that is related to the alternation frequency. Appropriate gearing converts this rotation speed to the correct ones for the hands of the analog clock. The development of [[electronics]] in the 20th century led to clocks with no clockwork parts at all. Time in these cases is measured in several ways, such as by the alternation of the AC supply, vibration of a [[tuning fork]], the behaviour of [[quartz]] crystals, or the quantum vibrations of atoms. Electronic circuits divide these high-frequency oscillations to slower ones that drive the time display. Even mechanical clocks have since come to be largely powered by batteries, removing the need for winding.\n\n===Quartz===\n[[File:Inside QuartzCrystal-Tuningfork.jpg|thumb|Picture of a quartz crystal resonator, used as the timekeeping component in quartz watches and clocks, with the case removed.

Attached to the oscillator is a ''controller'' device, which sustains the oscillator's motion by replacing the energy it loses to [[friction]], and converts its oscillations into a series of pulses. The pulses are then counted by some type of ''counter'', and the number of counts is converted into convenient units, usually seconds, minutes, hours, etc. Finally some kind of ''indicator'' displays the result in human readable form.\n\n===Power source===\n\n[[File:Mainspring wind-up keys.jpg|thumb|left|Keys of various sizes for winding up mainsprings on clocks.]]\n* In mechanical clocks, the power source is typically either a weight suspended from a cord or chain wrapped around a [[pulley]], [[sprocket]] or drum; or a spiral [[Spring (device)|spring]] called a [[mainspring]].  Mechanical clocks must be ''wound'' periodically, usually by turning a knob or key or by pulling on the free end of the chain, to store [[energy]] in the weight or spring to keep the clock running.\n* In [[electric clock]]s, the power source is either a [[Battery (electricity)|battery]] or the [[Mains power|AC power line]]. In clocks that use AC power, a small [[backup battery]] is often included to keep the clock running if it is unplugged temporarily from the wall or during a power outage.  Battery powered analog wall clocks are available that operate over 15 years between battery changes.\n{{breakafterimages}}\n\n===Oscillator===\n[[File:Split-flap clock.jpg|thumb|This clock used the 60&nbsp;Hz of electrical power, and features a split-flap physical for displaying the time numbers]]\nThe timekeeping element in every modern clock is a [[harmonic oscillator]], a physical object ([[resonator]]) that vibrates or [[oscillate]]s repetitively at a precisely constant [[frequency]].<ref name=\"Marrison\" />\n* In mechanical clocks, this is either a [[pendulum]] or a [[balance wheel]].\n* In some early electronic clocks and watches such as the [[Accutron]], it is a [[tuning fork]].\n* In [[quartz clock]]s and watches, it is a [[crystal oscillator|quartz crystal]].\n* In [[atomic clock]]s, it is the vibration of [[electron]]s in [[atom]]s as they emit [[microwave]]s.\n* In early mechanical clocks before 1657, it was a crude balance wheel or [[Verge escapement|foliot]] which was not a harmonic oscillator because it lacked a [[balance spring]]. As a result, they were very inaccurate, with errors of perhaps an hour a day.<ref>Milham, 1945, p. 85</ref>\nThe advantage of a harmonic oscillator over other forms of oscillator is that it employs [[resonance]] to vibrate at a precise natural [[resonant frequency]] or \"beat\" dependent only on its physical characteristics, and resists vibrating at other rates. The possible precision achievable by a harmonic oscillator is measured by a parameter called its [[Q factor|Q]],<ref>{{cite web|title=Quality factor, Q|work=Glossary|publisher=Time and Frequency Division, NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology)|year=2008|url=http://tf.nist.gov/general/enc-q.htm|accessdate=2008-06-04|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080504160852/http://tf.nist.gov/general/enc-q.htm|archivedate=May 4, 2008|df=mdy-all}}</ref><ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=Z7chuo4ebUAC&pg=PA44&sig=iBunChocEtJoeKS5p5IgJ1oyl4U Jespersen 1999, pp. 47\u201350]</ref> or quality factor, which increases (other things being equal) with its resonant frequency.<ref>{{cite book|last=Riehle|first=Fritz|title=Frequency Standards: Basics and Applications|journal=Frequency Standards: Basics and Applications|publisher=Wiley VCH Verlag & Co.|year=2004|location=Germany|page=9|url=https://books.google.com/?id=WZ34pQV-DXMC&pg=PA9&dq=Q+linewidth+%22split+the+line%22|isbn=978-3-527-40230-4|bibcode=2004fsba.book.....R}}</ref> This is why there has been a long term trend toward higher frequency oscillators in clocks. Balance wheels and pendulums always include a means of adjusting the rate of the timepiece. Quartz timepieces sometimes include a rate screw that adjusts a [[capacitor]] for that purpose. Atomic clocks are [[Standard (technical)|primary standards]], and their rate cannot be adjusted.\n\n====Synchronized or slave clocks====\n[[Image:Greenwich clock 1-manipulated.jpg|thumb|Shepherd Gate Clock received its timing signal from within the observatory]]\nSome clocks rely for their accuracy on an external oscillator; that is, they are automatically [[Synchronization|synchronized]] to a more accurate clock:\n* [[Slave clock]]s, used in large institutions and schools from the 1860s to the 1970s, kept time with a pendulum, but were wired to a [[master clock]] in the building, and periodically received a signal to synchronize them with the master, often on the hour.<ref>Milham, 1945, pp. 325\u2013328</ref> Later versions without pendulums were triggered by a pulse from the master clock and certain sequences used to force rapid synchronization following a power failure.\n* [[Electric clock|Synchronous electric clocks]] do not have an internal oscillator, but count cycles of the 50 or 60 [[Hertz|Hz]] oscillation of the [[Mains power|AC power line]], which is synchronized by the utility to a precision oscillator. The counting may be done electronically, usually in clocks with digital displays, or, in analog clocks, the AC may drive a [[synchronous motor]] which rotates an exact fraction of a revolution for every cycle of the line voltage, and drives the gear train.  Although changes in the [[Electric grid|grid]] line frequency due to load variations may cause the clock to temporarily gain or lose several seconds during the course of a day, the total number of cycles per 24 hours is maintained extremely accurately by the utility company, so that the clock keeps time accurately over long periods.\n* Computer [[real time clock]]s keep time with a quartz crystal, but can be periodically (usually weekly) synchronized over the [[Internet]] to atomic clocks ([[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]), using the [[Network Time Protocol]] (NTP). Sometimes computers on a [[local area network]] (LAN) get their time from a single local server which is maintained accurately.\n* [[Radio clock]]s keep time with a quartz crystal, but are periodically synchronized to [[radio time signal|time signals]] transmitted from dedicated [[Radio clock#List of radio time signal stations|standard time radio stations]] or [[satellite navigation]] signals, which are set by [[atomic clock]]s.\n\n===Controller===\nThis has the dual function of keeping the oscillator running by giving it 'pushes' to replace the energy lost to [[friction]], and converting its vibrations into a series of pulses that serve to measure the time.\n* In mechanical clocks, this is the [[escapement]], which gives precise pushes to the swinging pendulum or balance wheel, and releases one gear tooth of the ''escape wheel'' at each swing, allowing all the clock's wheels to move forward a fixed amount with each swing.\n* In electronic clocks this is an [[Electronic oscillator|electronic oscillator circuit]] that gives the vibrating quartz crystal or tuning fork tiny 'pushes', and generates a series of electrical pulses, one for each vibration of the crystal, which is called the [[clock signal]].\n* In [[atomic clock]]s the controller is an evacuated [[microwave]] [[Cavity resonator|cavity]] attached to a microwave [[Electronic oscillator|oscillator]] controlled by a [[microprocessor]]. A thin gas of [[caesium]] atoms is released into the cavity where they are exposed to [[microwaves]]. A laser measures how many atoms have absorbed the microwaves, and an electronic [[feedback]] control system called a [[phase-locked loop]] tunes the microwave oscillator until it is at the frequency that causes the atoms to vibrate and absorb the microwaves. Then the microwave signal is divided by [[digital counter]]s to become the [[clock signal]].<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=Z7chuo4ebUAC&pg=PA61&sig=r7PLMbI4rhAgfGkfBS-MCJEBkVs Jespersen 1999, pp. 52\u201362]</ref>\nIn mechanical clocks, the low [[Q factor|Q]] of the balance wheel or pendulum oscillator made them very sensitive to the disturbing effect of the impulses of the escapement, so the escapement had a great effect on the accuracy of the clock, and many escapement designs were tried. The higher Q of resonators in electronic clocks makes them relatively insensitive to the disturbing effects of the drive power, so the driving oscillator circuit is a much less critical component.<ref name=\"Marrison\" />\n\n===Counter chain===\nThis counts the pulses and adds them up to get traditional time units of [[second]]s, [[minute]]s, [[hour]]s, etc. It usually has a provision for ''setting'' the clock by manually entering the correct time into the counter.\n* In mechanical clocks this is done mechanically by a [[gear train]], known as the [[wheel train (horology)|wheel train]]. The gear train also has a second function; to transmit mechanical power from the power source to run the oscillator. There is a friction coupling called the 'cannon pinion' between the gears driving the hands and the rest of the clock, allowing the hands to be turned to set the time.<ref>Milham, 1945, p. 113</ref>\n* In digital clocks a series of [[integrated circuit]] [[counter (digital)|counters]] or dividers add the pulses up [[Digital data|digitally]], using [[binary numeral system|binary]] logic. Often pushbuttons on the case allow the hour and minute counters to be incremented and decremented to set the time.\n\n===Indicator===\n[[File:Cuckoo strikes the 8th hour.ogv|thumb|right|A [[Cuckoo clock]] with mechanical [[automaton]] and sound producer striking on the 8th hour on the analog dial.]]\nThis displays the count of seconds, minutes, hours, etc. in a human readable form.\n* The earliest mechanical clocks in the 13th century didn't have a visual indicator and signalled the time [[wikt:audible|audibly]] by striking [[bell (instrument)|bells]]. Many clocks to this day are [[striking clock]]s which strike the hour.\n* Analog clocks display time with an analog [[clock face]], which consists of a dial with the numbers 1 through 12 or 24, the hours in the day, around the outside.   The hours are indicated with an [[hour hand]], which makes one or two revolutions in a day, while the minutes are indicated by a [[Clock face|minute hand]], which makes one revolution per hour.  In mechanical clocks a gear train drives the hands; in electronic clocks the circuit produces pulses every second which drive a [[stepper motor]] and gear train, which move the hands.\n* [[Digital clock]]s display the time in periodically changing [[numerical digit|digits]] on a digital [[display device|display]].  A common misconception is that a digital clock is more accurate than an analog wall clock, but the indicator type is separate and apart from the accuracy of the timing source.\n* [[Talking clock]]s and the [[speaking clock]] services provided by telephone companies speak the time audibly, using either recorded or digitally [[Voice synthesis|synthesized voices]].\n\n==Types==\nClocks can be classified by the type of time display, as well as by the method of timekeeping.\n\n===Time display methods===\n\n====Analog====\n{{See also|Clock face}}\n[[File:Rew17h09 1977.jpg|thumb|A modern quartz clock with a 24-hour face]]\n[[File:Picadillycircuslinearclock.jpg|thumb|right|A linear clock at [[London]]'s [[Piccadilly Circus tube station]]. The 24 hour band moves across the static map, keeping pace with the apparent movement of the sun above ground, and a pointer fixed on London points to the current time.]]\n\nAnalog clocks usually use a [[clock face]] which indicates time using rotating pointers called \"hands\" on a fixed numbered dial or dials.  The standard clock face, known universally throughout the world,  has a short \"hour hand\" which indicates the [[hour]] on a circular dial of 12 [[hour]]s, making two revolutions per day, and a longer \"minute hand\" which indicates the minutes in the current hour on the same dial, which is also divided into 60 minutes. It may also have a \"second hand\" which indicates the [[second]]s in the current minute. The only other widely used clock face today is the [[24 hour analog dial]],  because of the use of [[24 hour time]] in [[military]] organizations and timetables.  Before the modern clock face was standardized during the [[Industrial Revolution]], many other face designs were used throughout the years, including dials divided into 6, 8, 10, and 24 hours.  During the [[French Revolution]] the French government tried to introduce a [[10-hour clock]], as part of their decimal-based [[metric system]] of measurement, but it didn't catch on.  An Italian 6 hour clock was developed in the 18th century, presumably to save power (a clock or watch striking 24 times uses more power).\n\nAnother type of analog clock is the [[sundial]], which tracks the sun continuously, registering the time by the shadow position of its [[gnomon]]. Because the sun does not adjust to daylight saving time, users must add an hour during that time. Corrections must also be made for the [[equation of time]], and for the difference between the longitudes of the sundial and of the central meridian of the [[time zone]] that is being used (i.e. 15 degrees east of the [[prime meridian]] for each hour that the time zone is ahead of [[GMT]]). Sundials use some or part of the 24 hour analog dial. There also exist clocks which use a digital display despite having an analog mechanism\u2014these are commonly referred to as [[flip clock]]s. Alternative systems have been proposed. For example, the \"Twelv\" clock <!-- not a typo, see http://www.gizmag.com/go/6312/ -->indicates the current hour using one of twelve colors, and indicates the minute by showing a proportion of a circular disk, similar to a [[Lunar phase|moon phase]].<ref>{{US Patent|7079452}}, {{US Patent|7221624}}</ref>\n\n====Digital====\n{{main|Digital clock}}\nDigital clocks display a numeric representation of time. Two numeric display formats are commonly used on [[Digital data|digital]] clocks:\n* the [[24-hour notation]] with hours ranging 00\u201323;\n* the [[12-hour notation]] with AM/PM indicator, with hours indicated as 12AM, followed by 1AM\u201311AM, followed by 12PM, followed by 1PM\u201311PM (a notation mostly used in domestic environments).\n\nMost digital clocks use electronic mechanisms and [[LCD]], [[LED]], or [[Vacuum fluorescent display|VFD]] displays; many other display technologies are used as well ([[cathode ray tube]]s, [[nixie tube]]s, etc.). After a reset, battery change or power failure, these clocks without a backup [[battery (electricity)|battery]] or [[capacitor]] either start counting from 12:00, or stay at 12:00, often with blinking digits indicating that the time needs to be set. Some newer clocks will reset themselves based on radio or Internet [[time server]]s that are tuned to national [[atomic clock]]s. Since the advent of digital clocks in the 1960s, the use of analog clocks has declined significantly.{{Citation needed|date=February 2020}}\n\nSome clocks, called '[[flip clock]]s', have digital displays that work mechanically. The digits are painted on sheets of material which are mounted like the pages of a book. Once a minute, a page is turned over to reveal the next digit. These displays are usually easier to read in brightly lit conditions than LCDs or LEDs. Also, they do not go back to 12:00 after a power interruption. Flip clocks generally do not have electronic mechanisms. Usually, they are driven by [[Alternating current|AC]]-[[synchronous motor]]s.\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"150px\" caption=\"Examples of digital clocks\">\nKanazawa Station Water Clock.jpg|Digital clock outside [[Kanazawa Station]] displaying the time by controlling valves on a fountain\nDigital-clock-radio-basic hf.jpg|Basic digital clock radio\nAnalog clock with digital display.png|Diagram of a mechanical digital display of a [[flip clock]]\n</gallery>\n\n====Hybrid (analog-digital)====\nClocks with analog quadrants, with a digital component, usually minutes and hours displayed analogously and seconds displayed in digital mode.\n\n====Auditory====\n{{Main|Talking clock}}\nFor convenience, distance, telephony or [[blindness]], auditory clocks present the time as sounds. The sound is either spoken [[natural language]], (e.g. \"The time is twelve thirty-five\"), or as auditory codes (e.g. number of sequential bell rings on the hour represents the number of the hour like the bell, [[Big Ben]]). Most telecommunication companies also provide a [[speaking clock]] service as well.\n\n====Word====\n[[File:Word clock wallpaper with comic speech bubble style.png|thumb|Software word clock]]\nWord clocks are clocks that display the time visually using sentences. E.g.: \"It's about three o'clock.\" These clocks can be implemented in hardware or software.\n\n====Projection====\n{{Main|Projection clock}}\nSome clocks, usually digital ones, include an optical [[Image projector|projector]] that shines a magnified image of the time display onto a screen or onto a surface such as an indoor ceiling or wall. The digits are large enough to be easily read, without using glasses, by persons with moderately imperfect vision, so the clocks are convenient for use in their bedrooms. Usually, the timekeeping circuitry has a battery as a backup source for an uninterrupted power supply to keep the clock on time, while the projection light only works when the unit is connected to an A.C. supply. Completely battery-powered portable versions resembling [[flashlight]]s are also available.\n\n====Tactile====\nAuditory and projection clocks can be used by people who are blind or have limited vision. There are also clocks for the blind that have displays that can be read by using the sense of touch. Some of these are similar to normal analog displays, but are constructed so the hands can be felt without damaging them. Another type is essentially digital, and uses devices that use a code such as [[Braille]] to show the digits so that they can be felt with the fingertips.\n\n====Multi-display====\nSome clocks have several displays driven by a single mechanism, and some others have several completely separate mechanisms in a single case. Clocks in public places often have several faces visible from different directions, so that the clock can be read from anywhere in the vicinity; all the faces show the same time. Other clocks show the current time in several time-zones. Watches that are intended to be carried by travellers often have two displays, one for the local time and the other for the time at home, which is useful for making pre-arranged phone calls. Some [[equation clock]]s have two displays, one showing [[Local mean time|mean time]] and the other [[Solar time#Apparent solar time|solar time]], as would be shown by a sundial. Some clocks have both analog and digital displays. Clocks with Braille displays usually also have conventional digits so they can be read by sighted people.\n\n==Purposes==\n[[File:Robbins NC Clock.jpg|thumb|upright|Many cities and towns traditionally have public clocks in a prominent location, such as a [[town square]] or [[city center]].  This one is on display at the center of the town of [[Robbins, North Carolina]].]]\n[[File:Restoran Pozoj, \u010cakovec - stara ura.jpg|thumb|upright|An old clock in a restaurant in [[Croatia]]]]\nClocks are in homes, offices and many other places; smaller ones ([[watch]]es) are carried on the wrist or in a pocket; larger ones are in public places, e.g. a [[railway station]] or [[Church (building)|church]]. A small clock is often shown in a corner of [[computer display]]s, [[mobile phone]]s and many [[MP3 player]]s.\n\nThe primary purpose of a clock is to ''display'' the time. Clocks may also have the facility to make a loud alert signal at a specified time, typically to waken a sleeper at a preset time; they are referred to as ''alarm clocks''. The alarm may start at a low volume and become louder, or have the facility to be switched off for a few minutes then resume. Alarm clocks with visible indicators are sometimes used to indicate to children too young to read the time that the time for sleep has finished; they are sometimes called ''training clocks''.\n\nA clock mechanism may be used to ''control'' a device according to time, e.g. a [[central heating]] system, a [[VCR]], or a [[time bomb]] (see: [[digital counter]]). Such mechanisms are usually called [[timer]]s. Clock mechanisms are also used to drive devices such as [[Solar tracker#Chronological tracker|solar trackers]] and [[Telescope mount#Equatorial mounts|astronomical telescopes]], which have to turn at accurately controlled speeds to counteract the rotation of the Earth.\n\nMost [[digital computer]]s depend on an internal signal at constant frequency to synchronize processing; this is referred to as a [[clock signal]]. (A few research projects are developing CPUs based on [[asynchronous circuit]]s.) Some equipment, including computers, also maintains time and date for use as required; this is referred to as time-of-day clock, and is distinct from the system clock signal, although possibly based on counting its cycles.\n\nIn Chinese culture, [[Homophonic puns in Mandarin Chinese#Gifts|giving a clock]] ({{zh|t=\u9001\u9418|s=\u9001\u949f|first=t|p=s\u00f2ng zh\u014dng}}) is often taboo, especially to the elderly as the term for this act [[Faux pas derived from Chinese pronunciation#Clock|is a homophone]] with the term for the act of attending another's funeral ({{zh|t={{linktext|\u9001\u7d42}}|s={{linktext|\u9001\u7ec8}}|first=t|p={{linktext|s\u00f2ngzh\u014dng}}}}).<ref name=\"Brown(2006)\">{{cite book|last=Brown|first=Ju|title=China, Japan, Korea Culture and Customs|year=2006|pages=57}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Seligman|first=Scott D.|title=Chinese business etiquette:: a guide to protocol, manners, and culture in the People's Republic of China|year=1999|publisher=Hachette Digital, Inc.}}</ref><ref>http://www.sohu.com/a/160882715_578225 {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180105233649/http://www.sohu.com/a/160882715_578225 |date=January 5, 2018 }} \u522b\u4eba\u8fc7\u8282\u559c\u5e86\u7684\u65f6\u5019\uff0c\u4e0d\u9001\u949f\u8868\u3002\u9001\u7ec8\u548c\u9001\u949f\u8c10\u97f3\u3002</ref> A UK government official [[Susan Kramer]] gave a watch to [[Taipei]] mayor [[Ko Wen-je]] unaware of such a taboo which resulted in some professional embarrassment and a pursuant apology.<ref>{{cite news|last1=BBC Staff|title=UK minister apologises for Taiwan watch gaffe|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-30994307|date=26 January 2015|accessdate=29 January 2018|work=BBC News}}</ref>\n\nThis homonymic pair works in both Mandarin and Cantonese, although in most parts of China only clocks and large bells, and not watches, are called \"''zhong''\", and watches are commonly given as gifts in China.\n\nHowever, should such a gift be given, the \"unluckiness\" of the gift can be countered by exacting a small monetary payment so the recipient is buying the clock and thereby counteracting the {{lang|zh|'\u9001'}} (\"give\") expression of the phrase.\n\n===Time standards===\n{{Main|Time standard|Atomic clock}}\nFor some scientific work timing of the utmost accuracy is essential. It is also necessary to have a standard of the maximum accuracy against which working clocks can be calibrated. An ideal clock would give the time to unlimited accuracy, but this is not realisable. Many physical processes, in particular including some [[Electronic transition|transitions]] between atomic [[energy level]]s, occur at exceedingly stable frequency; counting cycles of such a process can give a very accurate and consistent time\u2014clocks which work this way are usually called [[atomic clock]]s. Such clocks are typically large, very expensive, require a controlled environment, and are far more accurate than required for most purposes; they are typically used in a [[Metrology#Laboratories|standards laboratory]].\n\n===Navigation===\nUntil advances in the late twentieth century, [[navigation]] depended on the ability to measure [[latitude]] and [[longitude]]. Latitude can be determined through [[celestial navigation]]; the measurement of [[longitude]] requires accurate knowledge of time. This need was a major motivation for the development of accurate mechanical clocks. [[John Harrison]] created the first highly accurate [[marine chronometer]] in the mid-18th century. The [[Noon gun]] in [[Cape Town]] still fires an accurate signal to allow ships to check their [[marine chronometer|chronometers]]. Many buildings near major ports used to have (some still do) a large [[Time ball|ball]] mounted on a tower or mast arranged to drop at a pre-determined time, for the same purpose. While [[satellite navigation]] systems such as the [[Global Positioning System]] (GPS) require unprecedentedly accurate knowledge of time, this is supplied by equipment on the satellites; vehicles no longer need timekeeping equipment.\n\n==Specific types==\n[[File:Clock sculpture - Drexel University - IMG 7332.JPG|thumb|upright|A monumental conical pendulum clock by [[Eug\u00e8ne Farcot]], 1867.

During the 15th and 16th centuries, clockmaking flourished. The next development in accuracy occurred after 1656 with the invention of the [[pendulum clock]] by [[Christiaan Huygens]]. A major stimulus to improving the accuracy and reliability of clocks was the importance of precise time-keeping for navigation. The [[electric clock]] was patented in 1840. The development of [[electronics]] in the 20th century led to clocks with no clockwork parts at all.\n\nThe timekeeping element in every modern clock is a [[harmonic oscillator]], a physical object ([[resonator]]) that vibrates or [[oscillate]]s at a particular [[frequency]].<ref name=\"Marrison\" />\nThis object can be a [[pendulum]], a [[tuning fork]], a [[crystal oscillator|quartz crystal]], or the vibration of [[electron]]s in [[atom]]s as they emit [[microwave]]s.\n\nClocks have different ways of displaying the time. Analog clocks indicate time with a traditional [[clock face]], with moving hands. Digital clocks display a numeric representation of time. Two numbering systems are in use; [[24-hour time]] notation and 12-hour notation. Most digital clocks use electronic mechanisms and [[LCD]], [[LED]], or [[Vacuum fluorescent display|VFD]] displays. For the blind and use over telephones, [[speaking clock]]s state the time audibly in words.  There are also clocks for the blind that have displays that can be read by touch. The study of timekeeping is known as [[horology]].\n\n==Etymology==\nThe word ''clock'' derives from the medieval [[Latin]] word for \"bell\"; ''clogga'', and has [[cognate]]s in many European languages.

Examples of such duration timers are [[candle clock]]s, [[incense clock]]s and the [[hourglass]]. Both the candle clock and the incense clock work on the same principle wherein the consumption of resources is more or less constant allowing reasonably precise and repeatable estimates of time passages. In the hourglass, fine [[sand]] pouring through a tiny hole at a constant rate indicates an arbitrary, predetermined, passage of time. The resource is not consumed but re-used.\n\n===Water clocks===\n{{main|Water clock}}\n[[File:MandalayWaterClock.jpg|thumb|upright|A water clock for [[goldbeating]] [[goldleaf]] in [[Mandalay]] ([[Myanmar]]).]]\n\nWater clocks, also known as clepsydrae (sg: ''clepsydra''), along with the sundials, are possibly the oldest time-measuring instruments, with the only exceptions being the vertical [[gnomon]] and the day counting [[tally stick]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Turner|1984|p=1}}</ref> Given their great antiquity, where and when they first existed is not known and perhaps unknowable.

These advances were passed on through [[Byzantium]] and [[Islamic]] times, eventually making their way back to [[Europe]]. Independently, the Chinese developed their own advanced water clocks\uff08\u6c34\u9418\uff09in 725 AD, passing their ideas on to [[Korea]] and [[Japan]].\n\nSome water clock designs were developed independently and some knowledge was transferred through the spread of trade. [[Pre-modern]] societies do not have the same precise timekeeping requirements that exist in modern [[industrialism|industrial]] societies, where every hour of work or rest is monitored, and work may start or finish at any time regardless of external conditions. Instead, water clocks in ancient societies were used mainly for [[astrology|astrological]] reasons. These early water clocks were calibrated with a [[sundial]]. While never reaching the level of accuracy of a modern timepiece, the water clock was the most accurate and commonly used timekeeping device for millennia, until it was replaced by the more accurate [[pendulum clock]] in 17th-century Europe.\n\nIslamic civilization is credited with further advancing the accuracy of clocks with elaborate engineering.

Existing clock mechanisms that used [[Hydropower|water power]] were being adapted to take their driving power from falling weights. This power was controlled by some form of oscillating mechanism, probably derived from existing bell-ringing or alarm devices. This controlled release of power\u2014the [[escapement]]\u2014marks the beginning of the true mechanical clock, which differed from the previously mentioned cogwheel clocks. [[Verge escapement]] mechanism derived in the surge of true mechanical clocks, which didn't need any kind of fluid power, like water or mercury, to work.\n\nThese mechanical clocks were intended for two main purposes: for signalling and notification (e.g. the timing of services and public events), and for modeling the [[solar system]]. The former purpose is administrative, the latter arises naturally given the scholarly interests in astronomy, science, astrology, and how these subjects integrated with the religious philosophy of the time. The [[astrolabe]] was used both by astronomers and astrologers, and it was natural to apply a clockwork drive to the rotating plate to produce a working model of the solar system.\n\nSimple clocks intended mainly for notification were installed in towers, and did not always require faces or hands. They would have announced the [[canonical hours]] or intervals between set times of prayer. Canonical hours varied in length as the times of sunrise and sunset shifted. The more sophisticated astronomical clocks would have had moving dials or hands, and would have shown the time in various time systems, including [[Hour#Counting from sunset|Italian hours]], canonical hours, and time as measured by astronomers at the time. Both styles of clock started acquiring extravagant features such as [[automata]].\n\nIn 1283, a large clock was installed at [[Dunstable Priory]]; its location above the [[rood screen]] suggests that it was not a water clock.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.crystalinks.com/clocks.html|title=Clocks{{Snd}} Crystalinks|website=www.crystalinks.com|access-date=2019-06-06}}</ref> In 1292, [[Canterbury Cathedral]] installed a 'great horloge'.

The electric clock's mainspring is wound either with an [[electric motor]] or with an [[electromagnet]] and armature. In 1841, he first patented the [[Electromagnetism|electromagnetic]] pendulum. By the end of the nineteenth century, the advent of the dry cell battery made it feasible to use electric power in clocks. Spring or weight driven clocks that use electricity, either [[alternating current]] (AC) or [[direct current]] (DC), to rewind the spring or raise the weight of a mechanical clock would be classified as an [[electromechanical clock]]. This classification would also apply to clocks that employ an electrical impulse to propel the pendulum. In electromechanical clocks the electricity serves no time keeping function. These types of clocks were made as individual timepieces but more commonly used in synchronized time installations in schools, businesses, factories, railroads and government facilities as a [[master clock]] and [[slave clocks]].\n\nElectric clocks that are powered from the [[Alternating current|AC]] supply often use [[synchronous motor]]s. The supply current alternates with a frequency of 50&nbsp;[[hertz]] in many countries, and 60&nbsp;hertz in others. The [[Rotor (electric)|rotor]] of the motor rotates at a speed that is related to the alternation frequency. Appropriate gearing converts this rotation speed to the correct ones for the hands of the analog clock. The development of [[electronics]] in the 20th century led to clocks with no clockwork parts at all. Time in these cases is measured in several ways, such as by the alternation of the AC supply, vibration of a [[tuning fork]], the behaviour of [[quartz]] crystals, or the quantum vibrations of atoms. Electronic circuits divide these high-frequency oscillations to slower ones that drive the time display. Even mechanical clocks have since come to be largely powered by batteries, removing the need for winding.\n\n===Quartz===\n[[File:Inside QuartzCrystal-Tuningfork.jpg|thumb|Picture of a quartz crystal resonator, used as the timekeeping component in quartz watches and clocks, with the case removed.

Attached to the oscillator is a ''controller'' device, which sustains the oscillator's motion by replacing the energy it loses to [[friction]], and converts its oscillations into a series of pulses. The pulses are then counted by some type of ''counter'', and the number of counts is converted into convenient units, usually seconds, minutes, hours, etc. Finally some kind of ''indicator'' displays the result in human readable form.\n\n===Power source===\n\n[[File:Mainspring wind-up keys.jpg|thumb|left|Keys of various sizes for winding up mainsprings on clocks.]]\n* In mechanical clocks, the power source is typically either a weight suspended from a cord or chain wrapped around a [[pulley]], [[sprocket]] or drum; or a spiral [[Spring (device)|spring]] called a [[mainspring]].  Mechanical clocks must be ''wound'' periodically, usually by turning a knob or key or by pulling on the free end of the chain, to store [[energy]] in the weight or spring to keep the clock running.\n* In [[electric clock]]s, the power source is either a [[Battery (electricity)|battery]] or the [[Mains power|AC power line]]. In clocks that use AC power, a small [[backup battery]] is often included to keep the clock running if it is unplugged temporarily from the wall or during a power outage.  Battery powered analog wall clocks are available that operate over 15 years between battery changes.\n{{breakafterimages}}\n\n===Oscillator===\n[[File:Split-flap clock.jpg|thumb|This clock used the 60&nbsp;Hz of electrical power, and features a split-flap physical for displaying the time numbers]]\nThe timekeeping element in every modern clock is a [[harmonic oscillator]], a physical object ([[resonator]]) that vibrates or [[oscillate]]s repetitively at a precisely constant [[frequency]].<ref name=\"Marrison\" />\n* In mechanical clocks, this is either a [[pendulum]] or a [[balance wheel]].\n* In some early electronic clocks and watches such as the [[Accutron]], it is a [[tuning fork]].\n* In [[quartz clock]]s and watches, it is a [[crystal oscillator|quartz crystal]].\n* In [[atomic clock]]s, it is the vibration of [[electron]]s in [[atom]]s as they emit [[microwave]]s.\n* In early mechanical clocks before 1657, it was a crude balance wheel or [[Verge escapement|foliot]] which was not a harmonic oscillator because it lacked a [[balance spring]]. As a result, they were very inaccurate, with errors of perhaps an hour a day.<ref>Milham, 1945, p. 85</ref>\nThe advantage of a harmonic oscillator over other forms of oscillator is that it employs [[resonance]] to vibrate at a precise natural [[resonant frequency]] or \"beat\" dependent only on its physical characteristics, and resists vibrating at other rates. The possible precision achievable by a harmonic oscillator is measured by a parameter called its [[Q factor|Q]],<ref>{{cite web|title=Quality factor, Q|work=Glossary|publisher=Time and Frequency Division, NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology)|year=2008|url=http://tf.nist.gov/general/enc-q.htm|accessdate=2008-06-04|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080504160852/http://tf.nist.gov/general/enc-q.htm|archivedate=May 4, 2008|df=mdy-all}}</ref><ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=Z7chuo4ebUAC&pg=PA44&sig=iBunChocEtJoeKS5p5IgJ1oyl4U Jespersen 1999, pp. 47\u201350]</ref> or quality factor, which increases (other things being equal) with its resonant frequency.<ref>{{cite book|last=Riehle|first=Fritz|title=Frequency Standards: Basics and Applications|journal=Frequency Standards: Basics and Applications|publisher=Wiley VCH Verlag & Co.|year=2004|location=Germany|page=9|url=https://books.google.com/?id=WZ34pQV-DXMC&pg=PA9&dq=Q+linewidth+%22split+the+line%22|isbn=978-3-527-40230-4|bibcode=2004fsba.book.....R}}</ref> This is why there has been a long term trend toward higher frequency oscillators in clocks. Balance wheels and pendulums always include a means of adjusting the rate of the timepiece. Quartz timepieces sometimes include a rate screw that adjusts a [[capacitor]] for that purpose. Atomic clocks are [[Standard (technical)|primary standards]], and their rate cannot be adjusted.\n\n====Synchronized or slave clocks====\n[[Image:Greenwich clock 1-manipulated.jpg|thumb|Shepherd Gate Clock received its timing signal from within the observatory]]\nSome clocks rely for their accuracy on an external oscillator; that is, they are automatically [[Synchronization|synchronized]] to a more accurate clock:\n* [[Slave clock]]s, used in large institutions and schools from the 1860s to the 1970s, kept time with a pendulum, but were wired to a [[master clock]] in the building, and periodically received a signal to synchronize them with the master, often on the hour.<ref>Milham, 1945, pp. 325\u2013328</ref> Later versions without pendulums were triggered by a pulse from the master clock and certain sequences used to force rapid synchronization following a power failure.\n* [[Electric clock|Synchronous electric clocks]] do not have an internal oscillator, but count cycles of the 50 or 60 [[Hertz|Hz]] oscillation of the [[Mains power|AC power line]], which is synchronized by the utility to a precision oscillator. The counting may be done electronically, usually in clocks with digital displays, or, in analog clocks, the AC may drive a [[synchronous motor]] which rotates an exact fraction of a revolution for every cycle of the line voltage, and drives the gear train.  Although changes in the [[Electric grid|grid]] line frequency due to load variations may cause the clock to temporarily gain or lose several seconds during the course of a day, the total number of cycles per 24 hours is maintained extremely accurately by the utility company, so that the clock keeps time accurately over long periods.\n* Computer [[real time clock]]s keep time with a quartz crystal, but can be periodically (usually weekly) synchronized over the [[Internet]] to atomic clocks ([[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]), using the [[Network Time Protocol]] (NTP). Sometimes computers on a [[local area network]] (LAN) get their time from a single local server which is maintained accurately.\n* [[Radio clock]]s keep time with a quartz crystal, but are periodically synchronized to [[radio time signal|time signals]] transmitted from dedicated [[Radio clock#List of radio time signal stations|standard time radio stations]] or [[satellite navigation]] signals, which are set by [[atomic clock]]s.\n\n===Controller===\nThis has the dual function of keeping the oscillator running by giving it 'pushes' to replace the energy lost to [[friction]], and converting its vibrations into a series of pulses that serve to measure the time.\n* In mechanical clocks, this is the [[escapement]], which gives precise pushes to the swinging pendulum or balance wheel, and releases one gear tooth of the ''escape wheel'' at each swing, allowing all the clock's wheels to move forward a fixed amount with each swing.\n* In electronic clocks this is an [[Electronic oscillator|electronic oscillator circuit]] that gives the vibrating quartz crystal or tuning fork tiny 'pushes', and generates a series of electrical pulses, one for each vibration of the crystal, which is called the [[clock signal]].\n* In [[atomic clock]]s the controller is an evacuated [[microwave]] [[Cavity resonator|cavity]] attached to a microwave [[Electronic oscillator|oscillator]] controlled by a [[microprocessor]]. A thin gas of [[caesium]] atoms is released into the cavity where they are exposed to [[microwaves]]. A laser measures how many atoms have absorbed the microwaves, and an electronic [[feedback]] control system called a [[phase-locked loop]] tunes the microwave oscillator until it is at the frequency that causes the atoms to vibrate and absorb the microwaves. Then the microwave signal is divided by [[digital counter]]s to become the [[clock signal]].<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=Z7chuo4ebUAC&pg=PA61&sig=r7PLMbI4rhAgfGkfBS-MCJEBkVs Jespersen 1999, pp. 52\u201362]</ref>\nIn mechanical clocks, the low [[Q factor|Q]] of the balance wheel or pendulum oscillator made them very sensitive to the disturbing effect of the impulses of the escapement, so the escapement had a great effect on the accuracy of the clock, and many escapement designs were tried. The higher Q of resonators in electronic clocks makes them relatively insensitive to the disturbing effects of the drive power, so the driving oscillator circuit is a much less critical component.<ref name=\"Marrison\" />\n\n===Counter chain===\nThis counts the pulses and adds them up to get traditional time units of [[second]]s, [[minute]]s, [[hour]]s, etc. It usually has a provision for ''setting'' the clock by manually entering the correct time into the counter.\n* In mechanical clocks this is done mechanically by a [[gear train]], known as the [[wheel train (horology)|wheel train]]. The gear train also has a second function; to transmit mechanical power from the power source to run the oscillator. There is a friction coupling called the 'cannon pinion' between the gears driving the hands and the rest of the clock, allowing the hands to be turned to set the time.<ref>Milham, 1945, p. 113</ref>\n* In digital clocks a series of [[integrated circuit]] [[counter (digital)|counters]] or dividers add the pulses up [[Digital data|digitally]], using [[binary numeral system|binary]] logic. Often pushbuttons on the case allow the hour and minute counters to be incremented and decremented to set the time.\n\n===Indicator===\n[[File:Cuckoo strikes the 8th hour.ogv|thumb|right|A [[Cuckoo clock]] with mechanical [[automaton]] and sound producer striking on the 8th hour on the analog dial.]]\nThis displays the count of seconds, minutes, hours, etc. in a human readable form.\n* The earliest mechanical clocks in the 13th century didn't have a visual indicator and signalled the time [[wikt:audible|audibly]] by striking [[bell (instrument)|bells]]. Many clocks to this day are [[striking clock]]s which strike the hour.\n* Analog clocks display time with an analog [[clock face]], which consists of a dial with the numbers 1 through 12 or 24, the hours in the day, around the outside.   The hours are indicated with an [[hour hand]], which makes one or two revolutions in a day, while the minutes are indicated by a [[Clock face|minute hand]], which makes one revolution per hour.  In mechanical clocks a gear train drives the hands; in electronic clocks the circuit produces pulses every second which drive a [[stepper motor]] and gear train, which move the hands.\n* [[Digital clock]]s display the time in periodically changing [[numerical digit|digits]] on a digital [[display device|display]].  A common misconception is that a digital clock is more accurate than an analog wall clock, but the indicator type is separate and apart from the accuracy of the timing source.\n* [[Talking clock]]s and the [[speaking clock]] services provided by telephone companies speak the time audibly, using either recorded or digitally [[Voice synthesis|synthesized voices]].\n\n==Types==\nClocks can be classified by the type of time display, as well as by the method of timekeeping.\n\n===Time display methods===\n\n====Analog====\n{{See also|Clock face}}\n[[File:Rew17h09 1977.jpg|thumb|A modern quartz clock with a 24-hour face]]\n[[File:Picadillycircuslinearclock.jpg|thumb|right|A linear clock at [[London]]'s [[Piccadilly Circus tube station]]. The 24 hour band moves across the static map, keeping pace with the apparent movement of the sun above ground, and a pointer fixed on London points to the current time.]]\n\nAnalog clocks usually use a [[clock face]] which indicates time using rotating pointers called \"hands\" on a fixed numbered dial or dials.  The standard clock face, known universally throughout the world,  has a short \"hour hand\" which indicates the [[hour]] on a circular dial of 12 [[hour]]s, making two revolutions per day, and a longer \"minute hand\" which indicates the minutes in the current hour on the same dial, which is also divided into 60 minutes. It may also have a \"second hand\" which indicates the [[second]]s in the current minute. The only other widely used clock face today is the [[24 hour analog dial]],  because of the use of [[24 hour time]] in [[military]] organizations and timetables.  Before the modern clock face was standardized during the [[Industrial Revolution]], many other face designs were used throughout the years, including dials divided into 6, 8, 10, and 24 hours.  During the [[French Revolution]] the French government tried to introduce a [[10-hour clock]], as part of their decimal-based [[metric system]] of measurement, but it didn't catch on.  An Italian 6 hour clock was developed in the 18th century, presumably to save power (a clock or watch striking 24 times uses more power).\n\nAnother type of analog clock is the [[sundial]], which tracks the sun continuously, registering the time by the shadow position of its [[gnomon]]. Because the sun does not adjust to daylight saving time, users must add an hour during that time. Corrections must also be made for the [[equation of time]], and for the difference between the longitudes of the sundial and of the central meridian of the [[time zone]] that is being used (i.e. 15 degrees east of the [[prime meridian]] for each hour that the time zone is ahead of [[GMT]]). Sundials use some or part of the 24 hour analog dial. There also exist clocks which use a digital display despite having an analog mechanism\u2014these are commonly referred to as [[flip clock]]s. Alternative systems have been proposed. For example, the \"Twelv\" clock <!-- not a typo, see http://www.gizmag.com/go/6312/ -->indicates the current hour using one of twelve colors, and indicates the minute by showing a proportion of a circular disk, similar to a [[Lunar phase|moon phase]].<ref>{{US Patent|7079452}}, {{US Patent|7221624}}</ref>\n\n====Digital====\n{{main|Digital clock}}\nDigital clocks display a numeric representation of time. Two numeric display formats are commonly used on [[Digital data|digital]] clocks:\n* the [[24-hour notation]] with hours ranging 00\u201323;\n* the [[12-hour notation]] with AM/PM indicator, with hours indicated as 12AM, followed by 1AM\u201311AM, followed by 12PM, followed by 1PM\u201311PM (a notation mostly used in domestic environments).\n\nMost digital clocks use electronic mechanisms and [[LCD]], [[LED]], or [[Vacuum fluorescent display|VFD]] displays; many other display technologies are used as well ([[cathode ray tube]]s, [[nixie tube]]s, etc.). After a reset, battery change or power failure, these clocks without a backup [[battery (electricity)|battery]] or [[capacitor]] either start counting from 12:00, or stay at 12:00, often with blinking digits indicating that the time needs to be set. Some newer clocks will reset themselves based on radio or Internet [[time server]]s that are tuned to national [[atomic clock]]s. Since the advent of digital clocks in the 1960s, the use of analog clocks has declined significantly.{{Citation needed|date=February 2020}}\n\nSome clocks, called '[[flip clock]]s', have digital displays that work mechanically. The digits are painted on sheets of material which are mounted like the pages of a book. Once a minute, a page is turned over to reveal the next digit. These displays are usually easier to read in brightly lit conditions than LCDs or LEDs. Also, they do not go back to 12:00 after a power interruption. Flip clocks generally do not have electronic mechanisms. Usually, they are driven by [[Alternating current|AC]]-[[synchronous motor]]s.\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"150px\" caption=\"Examples of digital clocks\">\nKanazawa Station Water Clock.jpg|Digital clock outside [[Kanazawa Station]] displaying the time by controlling valves on a fountain\nDigital-clock-radio-basic hf.jpg|Basic digital clock radio\nAnalog clock with digital display.png|Diagram of a mechanical digital display of a [[flip clock]]\n</gallery>\n\n====Hybrid (analog-digital)====\nClocks with analog quadrants, with a digital component, usually minutes and hours displayed analogously and seconds displayed in digital mode.\n\n====Auditory====\n{{Main|Talking clock}}\nFor convenience, distance, telephony or [[blindness]], auditory clocks present the time as sounds. The sound is either spoken [[natural language]], (e.g. \"The time is twelve thirty-five\"), or as auditory codes (e.g. number of sequential bell rings on the hour represents the number of the hour like the bell, [[Big Ben]]). Most telecommunication companies also provide a [[speaking clock]] service as well.\n\n====Word====\n[[File:Word clock wallpaper with comic speech bubble style.png|thumb|Software word clock]]\nWord clocks are clocks that display the time visually using sentences. E.g.: \"It's about three o'clock.\" These clocks can be implemented in hardware or software.\n\n====Projection====\n{{Main|Projection clock}}\nSome clocks, usually digital ones, include an optical [[Image projector|projector]] that shines a magnified image of the time display onto a screen or onto a surface such as an indoor ceiling or wall. The digits are large enough to be easily read, without using glasses, by persons with moderately imperfect vision, so the clocks are convenient for use in their bedrooms. Usually, the timekeeping circuitry has a battery as a backup source for an uninterrupted power supply to keep the clock on time, while the projection light only works when the unit is connected to an A.C. supply. Completely battery-powered portable versions resembling [[flashlight]]s are also available.\n\n====Tactile====\nAuditory and projection clocks can be used by people who are blind or have limited vision. There are also clocks for the blind that have displays that can be read by using the sense of touch. Some of these are similar to normal analog displays, but are constructed so the hands can be felt without damaging them. Another type is essentially digital, and uses devices that use a code such as [[Braille]] to show the digits so that they can be felt with the fingertips.\n\n====Multi-display====\nSome clocks have several displays driven by a single mechanism, and some others have several completely separate mechanisms in a single case. Clocks in public places often have several faces visible from different directions, so that the clock can be read from anywhere in the vicinity; all the faces show the same time. Other clocks show the current time in several time-zones. Watches that are intended to be carried by travellers often have two displays, one for the local time and the other for the time at home, which is useful for making pre-arranged phone calls. Some [[equation clock]]s have two displays, one showing [[Local mean time|mean time]] and the other [[Solar time#Apparent solar time|solar time]], as would be shown by a sundial. Some clocks have both analog and digital displays. Clocks with Braille displays usually also have conventional digits so they can be read by sighted people.\n\n==Purposes==\n[[File:Robbins NC Clock.jpg|thumb|upright|Many cities and towns traditionally have public clocks in a prominent location, such as a [[town square]] or [[city center]].  This one is on display at the center of the town of [[Robbins, North Carolina]].]]\n[[File:Restoran Pozoj, \u010cakovec - stara ura.jpg|thumb|upright|An old clock in a restaurant in [[Croatia]]]]\nClocks are in homes, offices and many other places; smaller ones ([[watch]]es) are carried on the wrist or in a pocket; larger ones are in public places, e.g. a [[railway station]] or [[Church (building)|church]]. A small clock is often shown in a corner of [[computer display]]s, [[mobile phone]]s and many [[MP3 player]]s.\n\nThe primary purpose of a clock is to ''display'' the time. Clocks may also have the facility to make a loud alert signal at a specified time, typically to waken a sleeper at a preset time; they are referred to as ''alarm clocks''. The alarm may start at a low volume and become louder, or have the facility to be switched off for a few minutes then resume. Alarm clocks with visible indicators are sometimes used to indicate to children too young to read the time that the time for sleep has finished; they are sometimes called ''training clocks''.\n\nA clock mechanism may be used to ''control'' a device according to time, e.g. a [[central heating]] system, a [[VCR]], or a [[time bomb]] (see: [[digital counter]]). Such mechanisms are usually called [[timer]]s. Clock mechanisms are also used to drive devices such as [[Solar tracker#Chronological tracker|solar trackers]] and [[Telescope mount#Equatorial mounts|astronomical telescopes]], which have to turn at accurately controlled speeds to counteract the rotation of the Earth.\n\nMost [[digital computer]]s depend on an internal signal at constant frequency to synchronize processing; this is referred to as a [[clock signal]]. (A few research projects are developing CPUs based on [[asynchronous circuit]]s.) Some equipment, including computers, also maintains time and date for use as required; this is referred to as time-of-day clock, and is distinct from the system clock signal, although possibly based on counting its cycles.\n\nIn Chinese culture, [[Homophonic puns in Mandarin Chinese#Gifts|giving a clock]] ({{zh|t=\u9001\u9418|s=\u9001\u949f|first=t|p=s\u00f2ng zh\u014dng}}) is often taboo, especially to the elderly as the term for this act [[Faux pas derived from Chinese pronunciation#Clock|is a homophone]] with the term for the act of attending another's funeral ({{zh|t={{linktext|\u9001\u7d42}}|s={{linktext|\u9001\u7ec8}}|first=t|p={{linktext|s\u00f2ngzh\u014dng}}}}).<ref name=\"Brown(2006)\">{{cite book|last=Brown|first=Ju|title=China, Japan, Korea Culture and Customs|year=2006|pages=57}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Seligman|first=Scott D.|title=Chinese business etiquette:: a guide to protocol, manners, and culture in the People's Republic of China|year=1999|publisher=Hachette Digital, Inc.}}</ref><ref>http://www.sohu.com/a/160882715_578225 {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180105233649/http://www.sohu.com/a/160882715_578225 |date=January 5, 2018 }} \u522b\u4eba\u8fc7\u8282\u559c\u5e86\u7684\u65f6\u5019\uff0c\u4e0d\u9001\u949f\u8868\u3002\u9001\u7ec8\u548c\u9001\u949f\u8c10\u97f3\u3002</ref> A UK government official [[Susan Kramer]] gave a watch to [[Taipei]] mayor [[Ko Wen-je]] unaware of such a taboo which resulted in some professional embarrassment and a pursuant apology.<ref>{{cite news|last1=BBC Staff|title=UK minister apologises for Taiwan watch gaffe|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-30994307|date=26 January 2015|accessdate=29 January 2018|work=BBC News}}</ref>\n\nThis homonymic pair works in both Mandarin and Cantonese, although in most parts of China only clocks and large bells, and not watches, are called \"''zhong''\", and watches are commonly given as gifts in China.\n\nHowever, should such a gift be given, the \"unluckiness\" of the gift can be countered by exacting a small monetary payment so the recipient is buying the clock and thereby counteracting the {{lang|zh|'\u9001'}} (\"give\") expression of the phrase.\n\n===Time standards===\n{{Main|Time standard|Atomic clock}}\nFor some scientific work timing of the utmost accuracy is essential. It is also necessary to have a standard of the maximum accuracy against which working clocks can be calibrated. An ideal clock would give the time to unlimited accuracy, but this is not realisable. Many physical processes, in particular including some [[Electronic transition|transitions]] between atomic [[energy level]]s, occur at exceedingly stable frequency; counting cycles of such a process can give a very accurate and consistent time\u2014clocks which work this way are usually called [[atomic clock]]s. Such clocks are typically large, very expensive, require a controlled environment, and are far more accurate than required for most purposes; they are typically used in a [[Metrology#Laboratories|standards laboratory]].\n\n===Navigation===\nUntil advances in the late twentieth century, [[navigation]] depended on the ability to measure [[latitude]] and [[longitude]]. Latitude can be determined through [[celestial navigation]]; the measurement of [[longitude]] requires accurate knowledge of time. This need was a major motivation for the development of accurate mechanical clocks. [[John Harrison]] created the first highly accurate [[marine chronometer]] in the mid-18th century. The [[Noon gun]] in [[Cape Town]] still fires an accurate signal to allow ships to check their [[marine chronometer|chronometers]]. Many buildings near major ports used to have (some still do) a large [[Time ball|ball]] mounted on a tower or mast arranged to drop at a pre-determined time, for the same purpose. While [[satellite navigation]] systems such as the [[Global Positioning System]] (GPS) require unprecedentedly accurate knowledge of time, this is supplied by equipment on the satellites; vehicles no longer need timekeeping equipment.\n\n==Specific types==\n[[File:Clock sculpture - Drexel University - IMG 7332.JPG|thumb|upright|A monumental conical pendulum clock by [[Eug\u00e8ne Farcot]], 1867.

It commences at [[Toowoomba]], at the end of the [[Main Line railway]] from Brisbane, and extends west 810&nbsp;km to [[Cunnamulla]], passing through the major towns of [[Dalby, Queensland|Dalby]], [[Roma, Queensland|Roma]] and [[Charleville, Queensland|Charleville]], although services on the 184&nbsp;km section from [[Westgate, Queensland|Westgate]] to Cunnamulla have been suspended since 2011. Queensland was the first railway operator in the world to adopt narrow gauge for a main line,<ref>Kerr, J. 'Triumph of Narrow Gauge', Boolarong Publications 1990</ref> and this remains the system wide gauge.\n\n==History==\n\nThe initial section of the Western Line was built from Toowoomba to Dalby, opening 16 April 1868 (the first section of the [[Southern railway line|Southern line]], from Gowrie Junction, about 12&nbsp;km west of Toowoomba, to [[Warwick]], was opened in 1871, and bypassed in 1915). The line traverses relatively flat, easy country, gradually descending from 590m asl to 343m asl at Dalby.\n\nFrom Dalby the line was extended to Roma from 1877, opening on 16 September 1880, then to Charleville from 1883, opening 1 March 1888. The line was then extended in a southerly direction, following the Warrego River to Cunnamulla, opening on 10 October 1898. The country is undulating but mostly level, with Roma being 302m asl, Charleville 300m asl, and Cunnamulla 192m asl.\n\nNo significant earthworks were required for the construction of the line west of Dalby, and the rate of construction for all further sections was largely dictated by the annual funding allocations made by the Queensland government of the day.\n\nThe line was built to provide reliable transportation to facilitate the development and settlement of the southern Queensland interior by European settlers. It fulfilled that role until the adjacent road network was gradually upgraded to all-weather status from the 1960s-1990s, during which time the line gradually lost most traffic. Despite that, there remains a [[The Westlander|twice weekly passenger service]] as far as Charleville, and seasonal cattle trains from [[Quilpie]]. Following the [[2010-11 Queensland floods]], freight services were suspended between [[Westgate, Queensland|Westgate]] and Cunnamulla, and have not resumed. In September 2014, a truck carrying [[ammonium nitrate]] exploded near [[Wyandra, Queensland|Wyandra]], damaging the nearby railway bridge, which has not been repaired, effectively closing the line.<ref>http://www.brisbanetimes.com.au/queensland/truck-explosion-injures-eight-closes-mitchell-highway-20140906-10dam3.html</ref>\n\nIn recent years new coal mines near [[Chinchilla]] and Dalby have transported increasing tonnages (1-2M tonnes/month) for export from the [[Port of Brisbane]] at Fisherman Islands, which is now the main source of freight on the line. Grain is the other major, though seasonal freight.\n\n===Standard of construction===\nThe current speed and load limits on various sections reflects the level of traffic on them. From Toowoomba to Roma the rail is {{cvt|41|kg/m|lb/yd}}, 25-50% of the sleepers are steel, and the speed limit is {{cvt|80|km/h|mph}}, {{cvt|70|km/h|mph}} west of Miles and for coal trains east of there, with an axle load of {{cvt|15.75|t|LT ST}}.\n\nWest of Roma to Westgate the line speed remains {{cvt|70|km/h|mph}} though the rail is {{cvt|30|kg/m|lb/yd|1}}. From there to Cunnamulla and Quilpie the line remains largely as originally constructed, with light rail ({{cvt|21|kg/m|lb/yard|1|disp=or}}), all [[timber]] [[Railroad tie|sleepers]], {{convert|10|t|LT ST|adj=on}} [[axle load]], minimal earthworks and a line speed of {{cvt|60|km/h|mph}}.\n\n==Branch lines==\n\nA series of branch lines were built to connect to the Western line, and these are listed from east to west below.\n\n[[Crows Nest railway line|'''Pengarry Junction \u2013 Crows Nest''']], 55&nbsp;km, opened December 1886, closed 1961.\n\nAlthough not part of the Western line complex, it is worth noting that the opening of an 18&nbsp;km direct line from Toowoomba to Wyreema on the Southern line in 1915 bypassed the '''Gowrie Junction \u2013 Wyreema''' section, though that section remained open to serve local traffic until 1961.\n\n[[Haden railway line|'''Kingsthorpe \u2013 Haden''']], 33&nbsp;km, opened December 1910, closed 1964.\n\n[[Oakey\u2013Cooyar railway line|'''Oakey - Cooyar''']], 63&nbsp;km, opened April 1913, closed 1964.\n\n[[Cecil Plains railway line|'''Oakey - Cecil Plains''']], 63&nbsp;km, opened April 1919, out of service since 1994.\n\n[[Jandowae railway line|'''Dalby \u2013 Jandowae''']], 48&nbsp;km, opened August 1914, this line services a significant grain growing district and was upgraded to 15 tonne axle load in the 1990s, but subsequently closed on 25 June 2013.<ref>http://www.queenslandrail.com.au/NetworkServices/AccessandRegulation/Documents/Southern%20Queensland%20Line%20Diagrams.pdf</ref>\n\n[[Bell Branch railway line|'''Dalby \u2013 Bell''']], 38&nbsp;km, opened April 1906, out of service since 1994.\n\n[[Glenmorgan railway line|'''Dalby - Glenmorgan''']], 165&nbsp;km, opened in sections between 1911 and 1931, closed beyond Meandarra on 26 June 2013.\n\n'''Chinchilla \u2013 Barakula''' This line was built to very light standards, and was legally considered a tramway. Opened in May 1912, it was constructed to provide access to a large forest that would have supplied the 2.5m sleepers estimated to be required for the Great Western Railway proposal. It closed in 1971.\n\n[[Wandoan railway line|'''Miles - Wandoan''']] 70&nbsp;km, opened December 1914. This line was approved to be built to Taroom, a further 60&nbsp;km, but that never occurred. The [[Surat Basin railway|Wandoan-Taroom]] area has significant undeveloped coal deposits, and construction of a line from Wandoan through Taroom to connect with the Moura coal line system has been proposed to provide access to the coal export terminal at Gladstone.\n\n[[Injune railway line|'''Roma \u2013 Injune''']], opened between 1916 and 30 June 1920, 101&nbsp;km, closed 31 December 1966\n\n'''Westgate \u2013 Quilpie''', 201&nbsp;km. In 1910 the Queensland government adopted a significant plan to build a railway on the Queensland section of the alignment proposed from Bourke in western NSW, to Darwin in the NT, known as the [[Great Western Railway, Queensland|\u2018Great Western Railway\u2019]]. To connect to that alignment, construction began in 1911 from Westgate (21&nbsp;km south of Charleville) in a westerly direction. The First World War hampered construction, which ceased in April 1917, making Quilpie the effective terminus. Despite suggestions after the war that construction be recommended, the GWR project was never re-activated. Quilpie (population 560) became the loading point for significant numbers of cattle from western areas. The line is still known as the Great Western line by QR.\n\n==Services==\n\n===Passenger services===\nInitially all trains were 'mixed', carrying both goods and passengers. It was an efficient method for areas with low population, and whilst not quick by today's standards, it was still a vast improvement on the horse-drawn coaches and wagons. When the line opened to Mitchell, the accelerated daily mixed with travelling post office left Brisbane at 5.30am, reached Roma at 9.10pm and arrived at Mitchell at 11.50pm.\n\nThe first *[[Travelling post office, Queensland|travelling post office]] (TPO) was introduced in 1877, initially occupying the second class compartments of two composite carriages on the Brisbane-Dalby train. Four wheel vans were built specially for the service later that year. The Post Office supplied the staff to collect, sort and deliver mail on the TPO vans. The TPO was extended to Roma upon the opening of that extension, and extended as far as Charleville upon further line extensions being opened. The TPOs were removed as a cost saving measure in 1932.\n\nThe January 1888 timetable labelled the train the 'Western Mail', and when the line opened to Charleville later that year the train was extended once per week, reaching the new terminus at 6.30am Sunday. It departed for Brisbane at 10pm Sundays, taking 24 hours for the return journey. Compared to a weeks' journey by stage coach, this was high speed travel for the day.\n\nBy the time the Cunnamulla extension opened, the Western Mail was running twice a week to Charleville, with one service per week continuing on to the terminus. Second class sleepers were introduced at this time.\n\nFoot-warmers were introduced to the first class compartments on passenger services in 1911, and provided each winter until 1958.\n\n'Suburban' services were provide from Toowoomba - Wyreema via Willowburn between 1918\u20131926.\n\nA dining car was introduced in 1931, attached to the train from Mitchell to Cunnamulla and return. When the air-conditioned [[The Westlander|Westlander]] was introduced in 1954, the dining car was attached  at Roma. In 1967 a generator was fitted to an insulated van to provide power for an air-conditioned sitting car and mechanical refrigeration for the van to provide this comfort on the Quilpie service.\n\n===Freight services===\nFour coal mines currently rail coal to the Port of Brisbane. Cameby Downs mine is ~25&nbsp;km east of Miles, meaning a 350&nbsp;km journey to the coal terminal. Kogan Creek and Wilkie Creek mines are about 270&nbsp;km from the Port, and New Acland mine is about 200&nbsp;km from coal terminal.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Rail transport in Queensland]]\n*[[Travelling post office, Queensland]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category}}\n* [http://www.qhatlas.com.au/map/extent-queensland-railway-network-1925/ 1925 map of the Queensland railway system]\n\n{{Railway lines in Queensland |state=expanded}}\n\n[[Category:Railway lines in Queensland]]\n[[Category:Railway lines opened in 1868]]\n[[Category:South West Queensland]]\n[[Category:Darling Downs]]\n", "text_old": "{{Other uses|Western Railway (disambiguation){{!}}Western Railway}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=January 2012}}\n{{Use Australian English|date=January 2012}}\n[[File:StateLibQld 2 42271 Steam locomotive at the Chinchilla Railway Station, Queensland, 1908.jpg|thumb|Mail train arriving at Chinchilla, 1908]]\n[[File:StateLibQld 1 45979 Passenger train on the Bridge across Charley's Creek, Chinchilla during the 1921-22 floods.jpg|thumb|Passenger train on the Bridge across Charley's Creek, Chinchilla during the 1921-22 floods]]\n[[File:StateLibQld 1 115308 Railway station at Muckadilla, Queensland, ca. 1920.jpg|thumb|Muckadilla station, between Roma and Mitchell, ~1920]]\nThe '''Western railway line''' is a [[narrow gauge]] ({{Track gauge|1067mm|disp=or}}) [[railway]], connecting the south-east and south-west regions of [[Queensland]], [[Australia]]. It commences at [[Toowoomba]], at the end of the [[Main Line railway]] from Brisbane, and extends west 810&nbsp;km to [[Cunnamulla]], passing through the major towns of [[Dalby, Queensland|Dalby]], [[Roma, Queensland|Roma]] and [[Charleville, Queensland|Charleville]], although services on the 184&nbsp;km section from [[Westgate, Queensland|Westgate]] to Cunnamulla have been suspended since 2011. Queensland was the first railway operator in the world to adopt narrow gauge for a main line,<ref>Kerr, J. 'Triumph of Narrow Gauge', Boolarong Publications 1990</ref> and this remains the system wide gauge.\n\n==History==\n\nThe initial section of the Western Line was built from Toowoomba to Dalby, opening 16 April 1868 (the first section of the [[Southern railway line|Southern line]], from Gowrie Junction, about 12&nbsp;km west of Toowoomba, to [[Warwick]], was opened in 1871, and bypassed in 1915). The line traverses relatively flat, easy country, gradually descending from 590m asl to 343m asl at Dalby.\n\nFrom Dalby the line was extended to Roma from 1877, opening on 16 September 1880, then to Charleville from 1883, opening 1 March 1888. The line was then extended in a southerly direction, following the Warrego River to Cunnamulla, opening on 10 October 1898. The country is undulating but mostly level, with Roma being 302m asl, Charleville 300m asl, and Cunnamulla 192m asl.\n\nNo significant earthworks were required for the construction of the line west of Dalby, and the rate of construction for all further sections was largely dictated by the annual funding allocations made by the Queensland government of the day.\n\nThe line was built to provide reliable transportation to facilitate the development and settlement of the southern Queensland interior by European settlers. It fulfilled that role until the adjacent road network was gradually upgraded to all-weather status from the 1960s-1990s, during which time the line gradually lost most traffic. Despite that, there remains a [[The Westlander|twice weekly passenger service]] as far as Charleville, and seasonal cattle trains from [[Quilpie]]. Following the [[2010-11 Queensland floods]], freight services were suspended between [[Westgate, Queensland|Westgate]] and Cunnamulla, and have not resumed. In September 2014, a truck carrying [[ammonium nitrate]] exploded near [[Wyandra, Queensland|Wyandra]], damaging the nearby railway bridge, which has not been repaired, effectively closing the line.<ref>http://www.brisbanetimes.com.au/queensland/truck-explosion-injures-eight-closes-mitchell-highway-20140906-10dam3.html</ref>\n\nIn recent years new coal mines near [[Chinchilla]] and Dalby have transported increasing tonnages (1-2M tonnes/month) for export from the [[Port of Brisbane]] at Fisherman Islands, which is now the main source of freight on the line. Grain is the other major, though seasonal freight.\n\n===Standard of construction===\nThe current speed and load limits on various sections reflects the level of traffic on them. From Toowoomba to Roma the rail is {{cvt|41|kg/m|lb/yd}}, 25-50% of the sleepers are steel, and the speed limit is {{cvt|80|km/h|mph}}, {{cvt|70|km/h|mph}} west of Miles and for coal trains east of there, with an axle load of {{cvt|15.75|t|LT ST}}.\n\nWest of Roma to Westgate the line speed remains {{cvt|70|km/h|mph}} though the rail is {{cvt|30|kg/m|lb/yd|1}}. From there to Cunnamulla and Quilpie the line remains largely as originally constructed, with light rail ({{cvt|21|kg/m|lb/yard|1|disp=or}}), all [[timber]] [[Railroad tie|sleepers]], {{convert|10|t|LT ST|adj=on}} [[axle load]], minimal earthworks and a line speed of {{cvt|60|km/h|mph}}.\n\n==Branch lines==\n\nA series of branch lines were built to connect to the Western line, and these are listed from east to west below.\n\n[[Crows Nest railway line|'''Pengarry Junction \u2013 Crows Nest''']], 55&nbsp;km, opened December 1886, closed 1961.\n\nAlthough not part of the Western line complex, it is worth noting that the opening of an 18&nbsp;km direct line from Toowoomba to Wyreema on the Southern line in 1915 bypassed the '''Gowrie Junction \u2013 Wyreema''' section, though that section remained open to serve local traffic until 1961.\n\n[[Haden railway line|'''Kingsthorpe \u2013 Haden''']], 33&nbsp;km, opened December 1910, closed 1964.\n\n[[Oakey\u2013Cooyar railway line|'''Oakey - Cooyar''']], 63&nbsp;km, opened April 1913, closed 1964.\n\n[[Cecil Plains railway line|'''Oakey - Cecil Plains''']], 63&nbsp;km, opened April 1919, out of service since 1994.\n\n[[Jandowae railway line|'''Dalby \u2013 Jandowae''']], 48&nbsp;km, opened August 1914, this line services a significant grain growing district and was upgraded to 15 tonne axle load in the 1990s, but subsequently closed on 25 June 2013.<ref>http://www.queenslandrail.com.au/NetworkServices/AccessandRegulation/Documents/Southern%20Queensland%20Line%20Diagrams.pdf</ref>\n\n[[Bell Branch railway line|'''Dalby \u2013 Bell''']], 38&nbsp;km, opened April 1906, out of service since 1994.\n\n[[Glenmorgan railway line|'''Dalby - Glenmorgan''']], 165&nbsp;km, opened in sections between 1911 and 1931, closed beyond Meandarra on 26 June 2013.\n\n'''Chinchilla \u2013 Barakula''' This line was built to very light standards, and was legally considered a tramway. Opened in May 1912, it was constructed to provide access to a large forest that would have supplied the 2.5m sleepers estimated to be required for the Great Western Railway proposal. It closed in 1971.\n\n[[Wandoan railway line|'''Miles - Wandoan''']] 70&nbsp;km, opened December 1914. This line was approved to be built to Taroom, a further 60&nbsp;km, but that never occurred. The [[Surat Basin railway|Wandoan-Taroom]] area has significant undeveloped coal deposits, and construction of a line from Wandoan through Taroom to connect with the Moura coal line system has been proposed to provide access to the coal export terminal at Gladstone.\n\n[[Injune railway line|'''Roma \u2013 Injune''']], opened between 1916 and 30 June 1920, 101&nbsp;km, closed 31 December 1966\n\n'''Westgate \u2013 Quilpie''', 201&nbsp;km. In 1910 the Queensland government adopted a significant plan to build a railway on the Queensland section of the alignment proposed from Bourke in western NSW, to Darwin in the NT, known as the [[Great Western Railway, Queensland|\u2018Great Western Railway\u2019]]. To connect to that alignment, construction began in 1911 from Westgate (21&nbsp;km south of Charleville) in a westerly direction. The First World War hampered construction, which ceased in April 1917, making Quilpie the effective terminus. Despite suggestions after the war that construction be recommended, the GWR project was never re-activated. Quilpie (population 560) became the loading point for significant numbers of cattle from western areas. The line is still known as the Great Western line by QR.\n\n==Services==\n\n===Passenger services===\nInitially all trains were 'mixed', carrying both goods and passengers. It was an efficient method for areas with low population, and whilst not quick by today's standards, it was still a vast improvement on the horse-drawn coaches and wagons. When the line opened to Mitchell, the accelerated daily mixed with travelling post office left Brisbane at 5.30am, reached Roma at 9.10pm and arrived at Mitchell at 11.50pm.\n\nThe first *[[Travelling post office, Queensland|travelling post office]] (TPO) was introduced in 1877, initially occupying the second class compartments of two composite carriages on the Brisbane-Dalby train. Four wheel vans were built specially for the service later that year. The Post Office supplied the staff to collect, sort and deliver mail on the TPO vans. The TPO was extended to Roma upon the opening of that extension, and extended as far as Charleville upon further line extensions being opened. The TPOs were removed as a cost saving measure in 1932.\n\nThe January 1888 timetable labelled the train the 'Western Mail', and when the line opened to Charleville later that year the train was extended once per week, reaching the new terminus at 6.30am Sunday. It departed for Brisbane at 10pm Sundays, taking 24 hours for the return journey. Compared to a weeks' journey by stage coach, this was high speed travel for the day.\n\nBy the time the Cunnamulla extension opened, the Western Mail was running twice a week to Charleville, with one service per week continuing on to the terminus. Second class sleepers were introduced at this time.\n\nFoot-warmers were introduced to the first class compartments on passenger services in 1911, and provided each winter until 1958.\n\n'Suburban' services were provide from Toowoomba - Wyreema via Willowburn between 1918-1926.\n\nA dining car was introduced in 1931, attached to the train from Mitchell to Cunnamulla and return. When the air-conditioned [[The Westlander|Westlander]] was introduced in 1954, the dining car was attached  at Roma. In 1967 a generator was fitted to an insulated van to provide power for an air-conditioned sitting car and mechanical refrigeration for the van to provide this comfort on the Quilpie service.\n\n===Freight services===\nFour coal mines currently rail coal to the Port of Brisbane. Cameby Downs mine is ~25&nbsp;km east of Miles, meaning a 350&nbsp;km journey to the coal terminal. Kogan Creek and Wilkie Creek mines are about 270&nbsp;km from the Port, and New Acland mine is about 200&nbsp;km from coal terminal.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Rail transport in Queensland]]\n*[[Travelling post office, Queensland]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category}}\n* [http://www.qhatlas.com.au/map/extent-queensland-railway-network-1925/ 1925 map of the Queensland railway system]\n\n{{Railway lines in Queensland |state=expanded}}\n\n[[Category:Railway lines in Queensland]]\n[[Category:Railway lines opened in 1868]]\n[[Category:South West Queensland]]\n[[Category:Darling Downs]]\n", "name_user": "Iridescent", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200ePassenger services:Cleanup andtypo fixing,typo(s) fixed: 1918-1926 \u2192 1918\u20131926", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_railway_line,_Queensland"}
