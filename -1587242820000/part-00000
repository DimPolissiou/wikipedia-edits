By then, CBS also dropped the name \"Paramount\" from television for good, renaming CBS Paramount Television to CBS Television Studios.  Paramount has also joined up with Trifecta. However, CTD continues to distribute films currently copyrighted by CBS (or a subdivision thereof), including those films from [[Cinema Center Films]], [[CBS Theatrical Films]] and [[CBS Films]], along with a few select entries to which CBS bought ancillary rights in later years, such as ''[[My Fair Lady (film)|My Fair Lady]]''.\n\nThe current moniker for CTD's overseas distribution arm is [[CBS Studios International]] (since 2009).

However, some former Paramount programs, such as ''[[Entertainment Tonight]]'', then moved from being produced at the Paramount lot to CBS facilities.\n\nCurrently, syndication rights to Paramount's theatrical film library lie with [[Trifecta Entertainment & Media]].\n\n==List of first-run syndicated series from Paramount Domestic Television==\n===Original===\n====Off Network Shows====\n* ''[[America (US TV series)|America]]'' (1984\u20131985)\n* ''[[The Party Machine with Nia Peeples|The Party Machine]]'' (1991) (co-produced by Peeples Productions and Arsenio Hall Communications)\n* ''[[The Montel Williams Show]]'' (1991\u20132008, PDT succeeded Viacom as distributor in 1994)\n* ''[[Maury (TV series)|The Maury Povich Show]]'' (1991\u2013present, distributed by PDT from 1991\u20131998, now known as ''Maury'', now owned by [[NBCUniversal Television Distribution]])\n* ''[[Leeza]]'' (1994\u20132000, aired on [[NBC]] from 1994\u20131999 under [[Paramount Network Television]])\n* ''[[The Jon Stewart Show]]'' (1994\u20131995, a previous version aired on [[MTV]])\n* ''[[The Howie Mandel Show]]'' (1998\u20131999)\n* ''[[Rendez-View]]'' (2001\u20132002)\n\n====Talk Show====\n* ''[[The Arsenio Hall Show]]'' (1989\u20131994, produced by Arsenio Hall Communications. 2013\u20132014 revival co-produced by Tribune Broadcasting and distributed by successor CBS Television Distribution)\n* ''[[Dr. Phil (TV series)|Dr. Phil]]'' (2002\u2013present, produced by PDT from 2002\u20132006 and [[Harpo Productions]] and distributed by [[King World Productions]] from 2002\u20132007)\n\n====Infotainment====\n* ''[[Entertainment Tonight]]'' (1981\u2013present, distributed by PDT from 1981\u20132006)\n* ''[[Hard Copy]]'' (1989\u20131999)\n* ''[[The Insider (TV series)|The Insider]]'' (2004\u20132017) (distributed by PDT from 2004\u201306)\n\n====Courtroom shows====\n* ''[[Judge Judy]]'' (1996\u2013present, distributed by PDT from 1999\u20132006, co-produced by Big Ticket Television, formerly distributed by [[Worldvision Enterprises]])\n* ''[[Judge Mills Lane]]'' (1998\u20132001, distributed by PDT from 1999\u20132001, formerly distributed by [[Rysher Entertainment]])\n* ''[[Judge Joe Brown]]'' (1998\u20132013, distributed by PDT from 1999\u20132006, co-produced by Big Ticket Television, formerly distributed by Worldvision Enterprises)\n\n====Scripted comedy/drama====\n* ''[[Madame's Place]]'' (1982\u20131983)\n* ''[[Webster (TV series)|Webster]]'' (1983\u20131989), (Aired on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] from 1983\u20131987)\n* ''[[Marblehead Manor]]'' (1987\u20131988)\n* ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation]]'' (1987\u20131994)\n* ''[[Friday the 13th: The Series]]'' (1987\u20131990)\n* ''[[War of the Worlds (1988 TV series)|War of the Worlds]]'' (1988\u20131990)\n* ''[[Star Trek: Deep Space Nine]]'' (1993\u20131999)\n* ''[[Viper (TV series)|Viper]]'' (1994 then 1996\u20131999, aired on NBC in 1994)\n\n====Reality====\n* ''[[America's Dumbest Criminals]]'' (1996\u20132000, distributed by PDT from 1999\u20132000, formerly distributed by [[Worldvision Enterprises]])\n* ''[[Sightings (TV series)|Sightings]]'' (1992\u20131997), (Aired on [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] from 1992\u201394, and on [[Syfy|Sci-Fi Channel]] from 1996\u201397)\n* ''[[Real TV]]'' (1996\u20132001)\n* ''[[Maximum Exposure]]'' (2000\u20132002)\n* ''Life Moments'' (2002\u20132003)\n* ''TAG:I: Real Heroes'' (1999\u20132002)\n* ''[[Unexplained Mysteries]]'' (2003\u20132004)\n\n====Game shows====\n* ''[[Make Me Laugh]]'' (1979\u20131980)\n* ''[[Anything for Money]]'' (1984\u20131985)\n* ''[[Wipeout (1988 U.S. game show)|Wipeout]]'' (1988\u20131989)\n* ''[[The New Price Is Right (1994 game show)|The New Price Is Right]]'' (1994\u20131995)\n* ''[[Dance 360]]'' (2004\u20132005)\n\n====Music====\n* ''[[Solid Gold (TV series)|Solid Gold]]'' (1980\u20131988)\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n\n[[Category:Paramount Television]]\n[[Category:Television syndication distributors]]\n[[Category:Entertainment companies based in California]]\n[[Category:Media companies established in 1982]]\n[[Category:Media companies disestablished in 2006]]\n[[Category:1982 establishments in the United States]]\n[[Category:2006 disestablishments in the United States]]\n[[Category:ViacomCBS subsidiaries]]\n[[Category:CBS Television Distribution]]\n", "name_user": "197.214.69.6", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "(*STOP REVERTING THIS EDIT, YOU JERK!*)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paramount_Domestic_Television"}

It was released on March 29, 2019, by Darkroom and [[Interscope Records]] in the US and [[Polydor Records]] in the UK. Eilish largely co-wrote the album with her brother [[Finneas O'Connell]], who produced its music at his small bedroom studio in [[Highland Park, Los Angeles]].\n\nMusically, ''When We All Fall Asleep, Where Do We Go?'' has been characterized as a [[Pop music|pop]], [[electropop]], [[avant-pop]], and [[art pop]] album, though it also features influences from [[Hip hop music|hip hop]] and [[Industrial music|industrial]] music. Its songs explore themes such as modern youth, drug addiction, heartbreak, suicide, and [[mental health]], with lyrical sensibilities of humor and horror. Eilish said the album was inspired in part by [[lucid dreaming]] and [[night terrors]], which are reflected on the cover photo.\n\nThe album was marketed with the release of seven singles, four of which were [[RIAA certification|platinum]]-certified in the US{{snd}}\"[[Bury a Friend]]\", \"[[Wish You Were Gay]]\", \"[[All the Good Girls Go to Hell]]\", and the worldwide hit \"[[Bad Guy (Billie Eilish song)|Bad Guy]]\". Eilish also embarked on several tours in support of the album, including the [[When We All Fall Asleep Tour]] and the [[Where Do We Go? World Tour]]. An immediate commercial hit, the album topped [[record chart]]s in many countries during its first week of release. By June 2019, it had sold more than 1.3 million copies in the US and become the year's best-selling album in Canada, while in the UK it had made Eilish the youngest female solo act to chart at number one.\n\n''When We All Fall Asleep, Where Do We Go?'' was also a widespread critical success and one of the year's most acclaimed records, with many reviewers praising its subject matter, songwriting, cohesiveness, and Eilish's vocal style. At the [[62nd Annual Grammy Awards|2020 Grammy Awards]], it won [[Grammy Award for Album of the Year|Album of the Year]],  [[Grammy Award for Best Pop Vocal Album|Best Pop Vocal Album]], and Best Engineered Album, Non-Classical, while \"Bad Guy\" won [[Grammy Award for Record of the Year|Record of the Year]] and [[Grammy Award for Song of the Year|Song of the Year]]; Finneas also won the award for [[Grammy Award for Producer of the Year, Non-Classical|Producer of the Year, Non-Classical]].\n\n==Writing and recording==\n[[File:Billie Eilish 08 10 2017 -23 (36528997844).jpg|thumb|[[Billie Eilish]] (left) in 2017 with her brother [[Finneas O'Connell]] (right), who produced and co-wrote the album]]\n[[Billie Eilish]] and her brother [[Finneas O'Connell]] began working on ''When We All Fall Asleep, Where Do We Go?'' in May 2016 with the track \"Listen Before I Go\".

It was released on March 29, 2019, by Darkroom and [[Interscope Records]] in the US and [[Polydor Records]] in the UK. Eilish largely co-wrote the album with her brother [[Finneas O'Connell]], who produced its music at his small bedroom studio in [[Highland Park, Los Angeles]].\n\nMusically, ''When We All Fall Asleep, Where Do We Go?'' has been characterized as a [[Pop music|pop]], [[electropop]], [[avant-pop]], and [[art pop]] album, though it also features influences from [[Hip hop music|hip hop]] and [[Industrial music|industrial]] music. Its songs explore themes such as modern youth, drug addiction, heartbreak, suicide, and [[mental health]], with lyrical sensibilities of humor and horror. Eilish said the album was inspired in part by [[lucid dreaming]] and [[night terrors]], which are reflected on the cover photo.\n\nThe album was marketed with the release of seven singles, four of which were [[RIAA certification|platinum]]-certified in the US{{snd}}\"[[Bury a Friend]]\", \"[[Wish You Were Gay]]\", \"[[All the Good Girls Go to Hell]]\", and the worldwide hit \"[[Bad Guy (Billie Eilish song)|Bad Guy]]\". Eilish also embarked on several tours in support of the album, including the [[When We All Fall Asleep Tour]] and the [[Where Do We Go? World Tour]]. An immediate commercial hit, the album topped [[record chart]]s in many countries during its first week of release. By June 2019, it had sold more than 1.3 million copies in the US and become the year's best-selling album in Canada, while in the UK it had made Eilish the youngest female solo act to chart at number one.\n\n''When We All Fall Asleep, Where Do We Go?'' was also a widespread critical success and one of the year's most acclaimed records, with many reviewers praising its subject matter, songwriting, cohesiveness, and Eilish's vocal style. At the [[62nd Annual Grammy Awards|2020 Grammy Awards]], it won [[Grammy Award for Album of the Year|Album of the Year]],  [[Grammy Award for Best Pop Vocal Album|Best Pop Vocal Album]], and Best Engineered Album, Non-Classical, while \"Bad Guy\" won [[Grammy Award for Record of the Year|Record of the Year]] and [[Grammy Award for Song of the Year|Song of the Year]]; Finneas also won the award for [[Grammy Award for Producer of the Year, Non-Classical|Producer of the Year, Non-Classical]].\n\n==Writing and recording==\n[[File:Billie Eilish 08 10 2017 -23 (36528997844).jpg|thumb|[[Billie Eilish]] (left) in 2017 with her brother [[Finneas O'Connell]] (right), who produced and co-wrote the album]]\n[[Billie Eilish]] and her brother [[Finneas O'Connell]] began working on ''When We All Fall Asleep, Where Do We Go?'' in May 2016 with the track \"Listen Before I Go\".

Rocky's best friend [[Apollo Creed]] decides to fight him instead but is fatally beaten in the ring. Enraged, Rocky decides to fight Drago in the Soviet Union to avenge the death of his friend and defend the honor of his country.\n\nCritical reception was mixed, but the film was a huge success at the box office, earning $300 million. This film marked Carl Weathers' final appearance in the series. Its success led to a [[Rocky V|fifth entry]] released on November 16, 1990. The events of this film serve as the backstory to the plot of ''[[Creed II]]'', where Apollo Creed's son, [[Donnie Creed|Donnie]], is challenged to fight Drago's son, Viktor.\n\n== Plot ==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for featured films should be set between 400-700 words. -->\nAfter having reclaimed the world championship title, Rocky Balboa plans to retire and spend time with his family. In 1985, Ivan Drago, a Soviet boxer, arrives in the United States with his wife, Ludmilla, a Soviet swimmer and a team of trainers from the Soviet Union and Cuba. His manager, Nicolai Koloff, takes every opportunity to promote Drago's athleticism as a hallmark of Soviet superiority. Motivated by patriotism and an innate desire to prove himself, Apollo Creed challenges Drago to an exhibition bout. Rocky has reservations, but agrees to train Apollo despite his misgivings about the match.\n\nDuring a press conference regarding the match, hostility sparks between Apollo's and Drago's respective camps. The [[Exhibition fight|boxing exhibition]] takes place at the [[Bally's Las Vegas|MGM Grand Hotel]] in [[Las Vegas]].<ref>Block, Marcelline (2011). ''World Film Locations: Las Vegas''. Intellect Books. Pages 40\u201341. {{ISBN|9781841505886}}.</ref> Apollo enters the ring in an over-the-top patriotic entrance with [[James Brown]] performing \"[[Living in America (James Brown song)|Living in America]]\" complete with showgirls. The bout starts tamely with Apollo landing several punches that are ineffective against Drago, but Drago suddenly retaliates with devastating effects. By the end of the first round, Rocky and Apollo's trainer, [[Tony \"Duke\" Evers|Duke]], plead with him to give up, but a battered Apollo refuses to do so and tells Rocky to not stop the match \"no matter what.\" Drago continues to pummel him in the second round and Duke begs Rocky to throw in the towel. Rocky honors Apollo\u2019s wishes, which allows Drago to land one final punch on Apollo, knocking him out and killing him. In the aftermath, Drago displays no sense of contrition, commenting to the assembled media: \"If he dies, he dies.\"\n\nEnraged by guilt and the Soviets' cold indifference, Rocky decides to challenge Drago himself, vacating the title in order to do so. Drago's camp agrees to an unsanctioned 15-round fight in the Soviet Union on Christmas Day, an arrangement meant to protect Drago from the threats of violence he has been receiving in the U.S. Rocky travels to the Soviet Union without Adrian due to her disapproval of the match, setting up his training base in a remote cabin in [[Krasnogorsk, Moscow Oblast|Krasnogourbinsk]] with only Duke and brother-in-law Paulie to accompany him. Duke opens up to Rocky, stating that he actually raised Apollo and that his death felt like a father losing his son, and expresses his faith in Rocky that he will emerge victorious. To prepare for the match, Drago uses high-tech equipment, a team of trainers and doctors monitoring his every movement, and regular doses of [[anabolic steroids]]. Rocky, on the other hand, does roadwork in hip-deep snow over mountainous terrain and workouts utilizing antiquated farm equipment. Adrian arrives unexpectedly to give Rocky her support, which gives Rocky a new vigor.\n\nBefore the match, Drago is introduced with an elaborate patriotic ceremony, with the Soviet [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|general secretary]]  and the [[Politburo]] in attendance. The home crowd is squarely on Drago's side and hostile to Rocky. In contrast to his match with Apollo, Drago immediately goes on the offensive. Rocky takes a fierce pounding in the first round, but goes on the offensive toward the end of the second round after landing a brutal right hook that cuts Drago's left eye, stunning both Drago and the crowd. Duke encourages Rocky by reminding him that he just proved Drago is a man and not a machine as he\u2019s been made out to be. In contrast, Drago comments to his trainers that Rocky \"is not human, he is like a piece of iron,\" after his trainers reprimand him for his performance against the \"weak\" American.\n\nThe two boxers spend the next dozen rounds trading blows, with Rocky managing to continually hold his ground despite Drago's best efforts. His resilience and determination rallies the previously hostile Soviet crowd to his side. After being berated by Koloff, Drago rebels, throwing him from the ring and directly addressing Gorbachev, stating he fights only for himself. In the final round, with both fighters exhausted, Rocky initially takes more punishment, then seizes an opening and unleashes a series of vicious blows to defeat Drago by knockout.\n\nRocky gives a victory speech, acknowledging that the local crowd's disdain of him had turned to mutual respect during the fight. Rocky finally declares, \"If I can change and you can change, everybody can change!\" The Soviet premier stands up and reluctantly applauds Rocky, and his aides follow suit. Rocky ends his speech by wishing his son watching the match on TV a Merry Christmas, and raises his arms into the air in victory as the crowd applauds.\n\n==Cast==\n{{main|List of Rocky characters}} \n* [[Sylvester Stallone]] as [[Rocky Balboa|Robert \"Rocky\" Balboa]], \"The Italian Stallion\": Beloved Heavyweight Champion of the World\n* [[Talia Shire]] as [[Adrian Pennino|Adrian Balboa]]: Rocky's wife and support through his boxing career.\n* [[Burt Young]] as [[Paulie Pennino]]: Rocky's friend and brother-in-law.\n* [[Carl Weathers]] as [[Apollo Creed]]: Former Heavyweight Champion of the World, and close friend to Rocky\n* [[Dolph Lundgren]] as [[Ivan Drago|Captain Ivan Drago]]: the Soviets' prize Champion boxer and a Soviet Army infantry captain\n* [[Brigitte Nielsen]] as [[List of Rocky characters#Ludmilla Vobet Drago|Ludmilla Vobet Drago]]: Wife and supporter of Ivan Drago, and olympic female swimming champion.\n* [[Tony Burton]] as [[Tony \"Duke\" Evers]]: Apollo's father-figure, friend, trainer and manager, who becomes Rocky's trainer for his match against Drago.\n* [[Michael Pataki]] as [[List of Rocky characters#Nicolai Koloff|Nicolai Koloff]]: Trainer, promoter, and manager of Ivan Drago.\n*Rocky Krakoff as Rocky Jr.<ref>{{Citation|title=Rocky IV (1985) - IMDb|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0089927/fullcredits|access-date=2019-10-11}}</ref>\n* David Lloyd Austin as [[Mikhail Gorbachev]]\n\n[[LeRoy Neiman]] plays the ring announcer in the Creed-Drago match.

The small farm where Rocky lived and trained was in [[Jackson Hole]], and [[Grand Teton National Park]] was used for filming many of the outdoor sequences in the Soviet Union. The [[PNE Agrodome]] at [[Hastings Park]] in [[Vancouver, British Columbia]] served as the location of Rocky's Soviet bout.\n\nSylvester Stallone has stated that the original punching scenes filmed between him and Dolph Lundgren in the first portion of the fight are completely authentic. Stallone wanted to capture a realistic scene and Lundgren agreed that they would engage in legitimate sparring. One particularly forceful Lundgren punch to Stallone's chest slammed his heart against his breastbone, causing the heart to swell. Stallone, suffering from labored breathing and a blood pressure over 200, was flown from the set in Canada to [[Saint John's Health Center|Saint John's Regional Medical Center]] in [[Santa Monica]], and was forced into intensive care for eight days. Stallone later commented that he believed Lundgren had the athletic ability and talent to fight in the professional heavyweight division of boxing.<ref name=\"AICN\">{{cite web | url=http://www.aintitcool.com/node/30932 | title=Stallone Interview With Ain't It Cool News | publisher=AICN |accessdate=2007-01-25}}</ref>\n\nAdditionally, Stallone has stated that Lundgren nearly forced Carl Weathers to quit during the filming of the Apollo-vs.-Drago \"exhibition\" fight. At one point in the filming of the scene, Lundgren tossed Weathers into the corner of the boxing ring. Weathers shouted profanities at Lundgren while leaving the ring, and announcing that he was calling his agent and quitting the movie. Only after Stallone forced the two actors to reconcile did filming continue. The event caused a four-day work stoppage, while Weathers was talked back into the part and Lundgren agreed to tone down his aggressiveness.<ref name=\"AICN\"/>\n\n''Rocky IV'' is one of the few sport movies that applies genuine sound effects from actual punches, bona fide training methods created by boxing consultants, and a bevy of other new [[special effects]].<ref>{{cite journal |title='It's in the game': sport fans, film and digital gaming |first=G. |last=Crawford |journal=Sport in Society |year=2008 |volume=11 |issue=2\u20133 |pages=130\u2013145 |doi=10.1080/17430430701823380 }}</ref> The film is recognized as being ahead of its time in its demonstration of groundbreaking high-tech sporting equipment, some of which was experimental and 20 years from public use.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Von Hoff |first=D. |title=Rocky IV-Fight Medicine |journal=Medical Grand Rounds Presented at University of Texas Health Science Centre }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |title=Boxing and Medicine |first=R.

Stallone]]''.<ref>''Anderson v. Stallone'', 11 USPQ2D 1161 (C.D. Cal. 1989)</ref>  Timothy Anderson developed a treatment for ''Rocky IV'' on [[Spec script|spec]]; after the studio decided not to buy his treatment, he sued when the resulting movie script was similar to his treatment. The court held that Anderson had prepared an unauthorized [[derivative work]] of the characters Stallone had developed in ''Rocky I'' through ''III'', and thus he could not enforce his unauthorized story extension against the owner of the character's copyrights.\n\n==Music==\n===Soundtrack===\n{{Main article|Rocky IV (soundtrack)}}\n\nThe [[film score|musical score]] for ''Rocky IV'' was composed by [[Vince DiCola]], who would later compose the music for ''[[The Transformers: The Movie]]''. ''Rocky IV'' is the only film in the series not to feature original music by [[Bill Conti]], who was replaced by DiCola; however, it does feature arrangements of themes composed by Conti from previous films in the series, such as \"The Final Bell\". Conti, who was too busy with the first two ''[[The Karate Kid (1984 film)|Karate Kid]]'' films at the time, would return for ''[[Rocky V]]'' and ''[[Rocky Balboa (film)|Rocky Balboa]]''. Conti's famous piece of music from the Rocky series, \"[[Gonna Fly Now]]\", does not appear at all in ''Rocky IV'' (the first time in the series this happened), though a few bars of it are incorporated into DiCola's training montage instrumental.\n\nSongs from the movie included \"[[Living in America (James Brown song)|Living in America]]\", by [[James Brown]], and also music by [[John Cafferty]] (\"[[Heart's on Fire (John Cafferty song)|Heart's on Fire]]\", featuring Vince DiCola), [[Survivor (band)|Survivor]], [[Kenny Loggins]], and [[Robert Tepper]]. Four of these songs became U.S. chart hits, three of which reached the Top Five.  [[Go West (band)|Go West]] wrote \"One Way Street\" for the movie by request of Sylvester Stallone. [[Europe (band)|Europe]]'s hit \"[[The Final Countdown (song)|The Final Countdown]]\", written earlier in the decade by lead singer [[Joey Tempest]], is often incorrectly stated as being featured in the film due to its similarity to DiCola's \"Training Montage.\"{{citation needed|date=December 2014}} However, Europe's track was not released as a single until late 1986, after ''Rocky IV''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s release.\n\nAccording to singer [[Peter Cetera]], he originally wrote his best-selling solo single \"[[Glory of Love]]\" as the end title for this film, but was passed over by [[United Artists]], and instead used the theme for ''[[The Karate Kid Part II]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/videos/flashback-peter-cetera-honors-the-glory-of-karate-kids-love-20160414|title=Flashback: Peter Cetera Honors the 'Glory' of Karate Kid|publisher=|accessdate=March 18, 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Release==\n''Rocky IV'' premiered in [[Westwood, Los Angeles]] on November 21, 1985.<ref>{{cite magazine||magazine=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=November 6, 1985|page=30|title=Hollywood Soundtrack}}</ref>\n\n===Box office===\nThe film opened Wednesday, November 27 on 1,325 screens and over the 5-day [[Thanksgiving]] weekend, it grossed a non-summer record $31,770,105.<ref>{{cite news|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|page=6|date=November 29, 1989|title='Future II' blitzes b.o. with $43-mil; Harlem shaggy, 'Talking' quieter}}</ref> In its fourth week of release it expanded to a record 2,232 screens.<ref>{{AFI film|id=58336|title=Rocky IV}}</ref> It grossed a total of $127.8 million in United States and Canada, and $300 million worldwide, the most of any ''Rocky'' film.

However, he noted the damage both boxers sustained in the fight made them \"incapable of reason\", and thus instead planned ''[[Rocky V]]'' as a showcase of the dangers of boxing.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Acting His Age?

Rocky's best friend [[Apollo Creed]] decides to fight him instead but is fatally beaten in the ring. Enraged, Rocky decides to fight Drago in the Soviet Union to avenge the death of his friend and defend the honor of his country.\n\nCritical reception was mixed, but the film was a huge success at the box office, earning $300 million. This film marked Carl Weathers' final appearance in the series. Its success led to a [[Rocky V|fifth entry]] released on November 16, 1990. The events of this film serve as the backstory to the plot of ''[[Creed II]]'', where Apollo Creed's son, [[Donnie Creed|Donnie]], is challenged to fight Drago's son, Viktor.\n\n== Plot ==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for featured films should be set between 400-700 words. -->\nAfter having reclaimed the world championship title, Rocky Balboa plans to retire and spend time with his family. In 1985, Ivan Drago, a Soviet boxer, arrives in the United States with his wife, Ludmilla, a Soviet swimmer and a team of trainers from the Soviet Union and Cuba. His manager, Nicolai Koloff, takes every opportunity to promote Drago's athleticism as a hallmark of Soviet superiority. Motivated by patriotism and an innate desire to prove himself, Apollo Creed challenges Drago to an exhibition bout. Rocky has reservations, but agrees to train Apollo despite his misgivings about the match.\n\nDuring a press conference regarding the match, hostility sparks between Apollo's and Drago's respective camps. The [[Exhibition fight|boxing exhibition]] takes place at the [[Bally's Las Vegas|MGM Grand Hotel]] in [[Las Vegas]].<ref>Block, Marcelline (2011). ''World Film Locations: Las Vegas''. Intellect Books. Pages 40\u201341. {{ISBN|9781841505886}}.</ref> Apollo enters the ring in an over-the-top patriotic entrance with [[James Brown]] performing \"[[Living in America (James Brown song)|Living in America]]\" complete with showgirls. The bout starts tamely with Apollo landing several punches that are ineffective against Drago, but Drago suddenly retaliates with devastating effects. By the end of the first round, Rocky and Apollo's trainer, [[Tony \"Duke\" Evers|Duke]], plead with him to give up, but a battered Apollo refuses to do so and tells Rocky to not stop the match \"no matter what.\" Drago continues to pummel him in the second round and Duke begs Rocky to throw in the towel. Rocky honors Apollo\u2019s wishes, which allows Drago to land one final punch on Apollo, knocking him out and killing him. In the aftermath, Drago displays no sense of contrition, commenting to the assembled media: \"If he dies, he dies.\"\n\nEnraged by guilt and the Soviets' cold indifference, Rocky decides to challenge Drago himself, vacating the title in order to do so. Drago's camp agrees to an unsanctioned 15-round fight in the Soviet Union on Christmas Day, an arrangement meant to protect Drago from the threats of violence he has been receiving in the U.S. Rocky travels to the Soviet Union without Adrian due to her disapproval of the match, setting up his training base in a remote cabin in [[Krasnogorsk, Moscow Oblast|Krasnogourbinsk]] with only Duke and brother-in-law Paulie to accompany him. Duke opens up to Rocky, stating that he actually raised Apollo and that his death felt like a father losing his son, and expresses his faith in Rocky that he will emerge victorious. To prepare for the match, Drago uses high-tech equipment, a team of trainers and doctors monitoring his every movement, and regular doses of [[anabolic steroids]]. Rocky, on the other hand, does roadwork in hip-deep snow over mountainous terrain and workouts utilizing antiquated farm equipment. Adrian arrives unexpectedly to give Rocky her support, which gives Rocky a new vigor.\n\nBefore the match, Drago is introduced with an elaborate patriotic ceremony, with the Soviet [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|general secretary]]  and the [[Politburo]] in attendance. The home crowd is squarely on Drago's side and hostile to Rocky. In contrast to his match with Apollo, Drago immediately goes on the offensive. Rocky takes a fierce pounding in the first round, but goes on the offensive toward the end of the second round after landing a brutal right hook that cuts Drago's left eye, stunning both Drago and the crowd. Duke encourages Rocky by reminding him that he just proved Drago is a man and not a machine as he\u2019s been made out to be. In contrast, Drago comments to his trainers that Rocky \"is not human, he is like a piece of iron,\" after his trainers reprimand him for his performance against the \"weak\" American.\n\nThe two boxers spend the next dozen rounds trading blows, with Rocky managing to continually hold his ground despite Drago's best efforts. His resilience and determination rallies the previously hostile Soviet crowd to his side. After being berated by Koloff, Drago rebels, throwing him from the ring and directly addressing Gorbachev, stating he fights only for himself. In the final round, with both fighters exhausted, Rocky initially takes more punishment, then seizes an opening and unleashes a series of vicious blows to defeat Drago by knockout.\n\nRocky gives a victory speech, acknowledging that the local crowd's disdain of him had turned to mutual respect during the fight. Rocky finally declares, \"If I can change and you can change, everybody can change!\" The Soviet premier stands up and reluctantly applauds Rocky, and his aides follow suit. Rocky ends his speech by wishing his son watching the match on TV a Merry Christmas, and raises his arms into the air in victory as the crowd applauds.\n\n==Cast==\n{{main|List of Rocky characters}} \n* [[Sylvester Stallone]] as [[Rocky Balboa|Robert \"Rocky\" Balboa]], \"The Italian Stallion\": Beloved Heavyweight Champion of the World\n* [[Talia Shire]] as [[Adrian Pennino|Adrian Balboa]]: Rocky's wife and support through his boxing career.\n* [[Burt Young]] as [[Paulie Pennino]]: Rocky's friend and brother-in-law.\n* [[Carl Weathers]] as [[Apollo Creed]]: Former Heavyweight Champion of the World, and close friend to Rocky\n* [[Dolph Lundgren]] as [[Ivan Drago|Captain Ivan Drago]]: the Soviets' prize Champion boxer and a Soviet Army infantry captain\n* [[Brigitte Nielsen]] as [[List of Rocky characters#Ludmilla Vobet Drago|Ludmilla Vobet Drago]]: Wife and supporter of Ivan Drago, and olympic female swimming champion.\n* [[Tony Burton]] as [[Tony \"Duke\" Evers]]: Apollo's father-figure, friend, trainer and manager, who becomes Rocky's trainer for his match against Drago.\n* [[Michael Pataki]] as [[List of Rocky characters#Nicolai Koloff|Nicolai Koloff]]: Trainer, promoter, and manager of Ivan Drago.\n*Rocky Krakoff as Rocky Jr.<ref>{{Citation|title=Rocky IV (1985) - IMDb|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0089927/fullcredits|access-date=2019-10-11}}</ref>\n* David Lloyd Austin as [[Mikhail Gorbachev]]\n\n[[LeRoy Neiman]] plays the ring announcer in the Creed-Drago match.

The small farm where Rocky lived and trained was in [[Jackson Hole]], and [[Grand Teton National Park]] was used for filming many of the outdoor sequences in the Soviet Union. The [[PNE Agrodome]] at [[Hastings Park]] in [[Vancouver, British Columbia]] served as the location of Rocky's Soviet bout.\n\nSylvester Stallone has stated that the original punching scenes filmed between him and Dolph Lundgren in the first portion of the fight are completely authentic. Stallone wanted to capture a realistic scene and Lundgren agreed that they would engage in legitimate sparring. One particularly forceful Lundgren punch to Stallone's chest slammed his heart against his breastbone, causing the heart to swell. Stallone, suffering from labored breathing and a blood pressure over 200, was flown from the set in Canada to [[Saint John's Health Center|Saint John's Regional Medical Center]] in [[Santa Monica]], and was forced into intensive care for eight days. Stallone later commented that he believed Lundgren had the athletic ability and talent to fight in the professional heavyweight division of boxing.<ref name=\"AICN\">{{cite web | url=http://www.aintitcool.com/node/30932 | title=Stallone Interview With Ain't It Cool News | publisher=AICN |accessdate=2007-01-25}}</ref>\n\nAdditionally, Stallone has stated that Lundgren nearly forced Carl Weathers to quit during the filming of the Apollo-vs.-Drago \"exhibition\" fight. At one point in the filming of the scene, Lundgren tossed Weathers into the corner of the boxing ring. Weathers shouted profanities at Lundgren while leaving the ring, and announcing that he was calling his agent and quitting the movie. Only after Stallone forced the two actors to reconcile did filming continue. The event caused a four-day work stoppage, while Weathers was talked back into the part and Lundgren agreed to tone down his aggressiveness.<ref name=\"AICN\"/>\n\n''Rocky IV'' is one of the few sport movies that applies genuine sound effects from actual punches, bona fide training methods created by boxing consultants, and a bevy of other new [[special effects]].<ref>{{cite journal |title='It's in the game': sport fans, film and digital gaming |first=G. |last=Crawford |journal=Sport in Society |year=2008 |volume=11 |issue=2\u20133 |pages=130\u2013145 |doi=10.1080/17430430701823380 }}</ref> The film is recognized as being ahead of its time in its demonstration of groundbreaking high-tech sporting equipment, some of which was experimental and 20 years from public use.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Von Hoff |first=D. |title=Rocky IV-Fight Medicine |journal=Medical Grand Rounds Presented at University of Texas Health Science Centre }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |title=Boxing and Medicine |first=R.

Stallone's future wife, Brigitte Nielsen, appeared as Drago's wife, Ludmilla.\n\nPaulie's robot, a character that through the years has enjoyed a cult following of its own, was created by International Robotics Inc. in New York City. The robot's initial voice was that of the company's CEO, Robert Doornick. The robot is identified by its engineers as \"SICO\" and is/was a member of the [[Screen Actors Guild]].

Cal. 1989)</ref>  Timothy Anderson developed a treatment for ''Rocky IV'' on [[Spec script|spec]]; after the studio decided not to buy his treatment, he sued when the resulting movie script was similar to his treatment. The court held that Anderson had prepared an unauthorized [[derivative work]] of the characters Stallone had developed in ''Rocky I'' through ''III'', and thus he could not enforce his unauthorized story extension against the owner of the character's copyrights.\n\n==Music==\n===Soundtrack===\n{{Main article|Rocky IV (soundtrack)}}\n\nThe [[film score|musical score]] for ''Rocky IV'' was composed by [[Vince DiCola]], who would later compose the music for ''[[The Transformers: The Movie]]''. ''Rocky IV'' is the only film in the series not to feature original music by [[Bill Conti]], who was replaced by DiCola; however, it does feature arrangements of themes composed by Conti from previous films in the series, such as \"The Final Bell\". Conti, who was too busy with the first two ''[[The Karate Kid (1984 film)|Karate Kid]]'' films at the time, would return for ''[[Rocky V]]'' and ''[[Rocky Balboa (film)|Rocky Balboa]]''. Conti's famous piece of music from the Rocky series, \"[[Gonna Fly Now]]\", does not appear at all in ''Rocky IV'' (the first time in the series this happened), though a few bars of it are incorporated into DiCola's training montage instrumental.\n\nSongs from the movie included \"[[Living in America (James Brown song)|Living in America]]\", by [[James Brown]], and also music by [[John Cafferty]] (\"[[Heart's on Fire (John Cafferty song)|Heart's on Fire]]\", featuring Vince DiCola), [[Survivor (band)|Survivor]], [[Kenny Loggins]], and [[Robert Tepper]]. Four of these songs became U.S. chart hits, three of which reached the Top Five.  [[Go West (band)|Go West]] wrote \"One Way Street\" for the movie by request of Sylvester Stallone.

However, he noted the damage both boxers sustained in the fight made them \"incapable of reason\", and thus instead planned ''[[Rocky V]]'' as a showcase of the dangers of boxing.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Acting His Age?

Chief Inspector [[Frederick Abberline]] of [[Scotland Yard]] is assigned by his superiors to investigate the murder and brutal mutilation of a prostitute in the [[East End of London]]. As the mutilated corpses of other \"[[Shilling (British coin)|shilling]] whores\" turn up in the same area, London's tabloid journalists - particularly Benjamin Bates of ''[[The Star (London)|The Star]]'' - whip up a public frenzy. The killer is nicknamed \"Jack the Ripper\" after [[Dear Boss letter|a letter]] bearing that name and supposedly from the killer, is forwarded to Scotland Yard. As the Ripper terrorizes London, public outrage erupts throughout the country, and Police Commissioner [[Sir Charles Warren]] fears that a [[revolution]] is in the air in London's East End.\n\nThere is no shortage of suspects for Abberline and his partner, Sergeant [[George Godley]]. These suspects include the American actor [[Richard Mansfield]] (appearing in the play ''[[Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde|Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde]]'' in London); police surgeon Dr Henry Llewellyn; [[socialist]] agitator [[George Lusk]]; [[Queen Victoria]]'s [[clairvoyant]] [[Robert James Lees|Robert Lees]]; the Queen's grandson [[Prince Albert Victor, Duke of Clarence and Avondale|Prince Albert Victor]]; and Dr [[Theodore Dyke Acland]], the son-in-law of [[Sir William Gull, 1st Baronet|Sir William Gull]], Royal Surgeon to Queen Victoria and expert on diseases of the brain.

(In real-life, at the time of the Ripper murders, Abberline was married to Emma Beament, the daughter of a merchant. In ''Jack the Ripper'', Emma Prentiss is not married to Abberline.) Furthermore, the series' portrayal of Abberline unmasking the Ripper as William Gull contradicts the fact that the real-life Abberline believed that the Ripper was actually [[George Chapman (murderer)|George Chapman]]. [[George Lusk]] of the [[Whitechapel Vigilance Committee]] was depicted in the film as a violent, argumentative troublemaker when in fact he was very quiet, a good local business man who was known for his peaceful nature, a [[churchwarden]] and a [[Freemasonry|Freemason]]. [[Hugh Fraser (actor)|Hugh Fraser]] wore clothing that his character, [[Sir Charles Warren]], had actually worn. This was both [[Harry Andrews]] and [[Edward Judd]]'s last production. [[Armand Assante]]'s stand-in died during filming. Of her experience filming ''Jack the Ripper'', [[Jane Seymour (actress)|Jane Seymour]] said, \"That was fun. I played it as a redhead, it was a great role, and of course I got to work with the great Michael Caine. I had been warned that Michael is tough on actors and actresses unless they know their lines and are very professional, which mostly I was, but they didn\u2019t tell me that he literally liked to do one take and then go and have lunch with his wife. Which is basically what happened! So you\u2019d show up, and unless the [microphone] landed on you or the camera bumped onto you or he messed up, which he never did, that was it. It was one take, and then you\u2019re on to the next. So that was interesting.\"<ref name=\"Harris\"/> [[Michael Caine]] worked with ''Jack the Ripper'' director David Wickes on another television film: the four-hour, two-part ''Jekyll & Hyde'' (1990), based on [[Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde|the book]] by [[Robert Louis Stevenson]]. The story of Jekyll and Hyde is a plot-point in Wickes' ''Jack the Ripper'' series.\n\nUsing historical characters involved in the genuine 1888 hunt for the killer, ''Jack the Ripper'' was written by [[Derek Marlowe]] and David Wickes and [[film director|directed]] by Wickes. The series drew heavily on the same discredited [[Freemasonry|Masonic]]/[[British Royal Family|Royal Family]] [[Jack the Ripper: The Final Solution#Claims of Thomas Stowell|conspiracy theory]] as the 1978 film ''[[Murder By Decree]]''; it is also the account presented in the 2001 film ''[[From Hell (film)|From Hell]]''. This theory was first put forward in the 1960s by [[Thomas E. A. Stowell]] who published his claims in a November 1970 issue of ''The Criminologist''.<ref>Stowell, T. E. A. (November 1970) \"Jack the Ripper&nbsp;\u2013 A Solution?\". ''The Criminologist'' vol.5 pp.40\u201351</ref> The theory was later turned into the bestselling ''[[Jack the Ripper: The Final Solution]]'' (1976) by [[Stephen Knight (author)|Stephen Knight]]. The 1988 series dispenses with the fictional [[Sherlock Holmes]] who uncovered the conspiracy in ''Murder By Decree'' and instead concentrates on the real-life [[Whitechapel]] detective [[Frederick Abberline]], as assisted by Sergeant [[George Godley]].<ref name=eoff>[http://www.eofftv.com/review/j/jack_the_ripper_1988_review.htm ''Jack the Ripper'' reviewed on Eofftv.com]</ref>\n\nThe series is constructed as a [[Whodunit]] in which viewers are led to suspect, at various points, that [[Prince Albert Victor, Duke of Clarence and Avondale|Prince Albert Victor]], [[Richard Mansfield]], [[George Lusk]], Henry Llewellyn or [[Theodore Dyke Acland]] could be Jack the Ripper. Before ''Jack the Ripper'' was broadcast, director/co-writer David Wickes claimed that he had been allowed unprecedented access to the [[Scotland Yard]] files on the [[Jack the Ripper|Ripper]] case and stated that his production would be revealing the 'true' identity of Jack the Ripper for the first time. After pressure from [[Ripperologist]] [[Melvin Harris]] and others, Wickes was forced to withdraw this claim.<ref name=eoff/> Nevertheless, the series begins with a disclaimer on behalf of the production staff, stating, ''\"Our story is based on extensive research, including a review of the official files by special permission of the [[Home Office]] and interviews with leading criminologists and Scotland Yard officials.\"'' The series' \"revelation\" that [[Sir William Gull, 1st Baronet|Sir William Gull]] was Jack the Ripper was not new: Stephen Knight's 1976 book alleged that Gull was the Ripper, and prior to that, the theory had been cited in the 1973 [[BBC]] TV series ''[[Jack the Ripper (1973 TV series)|Jack the Ripper]]'' (two episodes of which were directed by David Wickes). Furthermore, the Ripper character in the film ''Murder by Decree'', assigned the fictitious name \"Sir Thomas Spivey,\" was based on Sir William Gull.\n\nMarlowe and Wickes retained ''The Final Solution''{{'}}s contention that William Gull was Jack the Ripper, but dispensed with most of the rest of the theory: the involvement of Prince Albert Victor is dismissed as a [[Red herring]]; there is no mention of [[Walter Sickert]], Annie Crook, an illegitimate Royal baby, blackmail, or [[Freemasons]]; and the explanation given for the murders is [[dementia]], acquired by Gull from a [[stroke]]. The original script adhered more closely to ''The Final Solution'' but was changed during the course of production: interviewed in 2017, [[Jane Seymour (actress)|Jane Seymour]] stated \"when we first got the script, they kind of implicated the Masons as being involved, and by the time we finished the movie, there was pretty much no mention of the Masons.\"<ref name=\"Harris\">{{cite web |first=Will |last=Harris |url=http://www.avclub.com/article/jane-seymour-how-dr-quinn-was-not-supposed-last-an-253538 |title=Jane Seymour on how Dr. Quinn was not supposed to last and her \"whole new career\" in comedy|date=17 April 2017 |work=[[The A.V. Club]]}}</ref>\n\nThe series ends with Gull's son-in-law, Dr. Theodore Dyke Acland, theorising that Gull was using himself as a case-study of [[multiple personality disorder]] (giving free rein to his murderous impulses in an effort to understand his own multi-faceted mind). The series presents Gull acting of his own accord (with only coachman [[John Netley]] complicit in his crimes), and conspiracy only coming into play ''after'' Gull's arrest: according to the series, Gull's murders were covered up at the behest of police commissioner [[Sir Charles Warren]] to avoid a scandal, as Gull was [[Queen Victoria]]'s physician. The series' denouement thus differs to Stephen Knight's claim that Warren was aware of the Ripper's identity as the crimes were being committed.\n\n''Jack the Ripper'' ends with the following disclaimer:\n\n{{cquote|''In the strange case of Jack the Ripper, there was no trial and no signed confession.''\n\n''In 1888, neither fingerprinting nor bloodtyping was in use and no conclusive forensic, documentary or eye-witness testimony was available. Thus, positive proof of the Ripper\u2019s identity is not available.''\n\n''We have come to our conclusions after careful study and painstaking deduction. Other researchers, criminologists and writers may take a different view.''\n\n''We believe our conclusions to be true.''}}\n\nThe series was originally mounted on a relatively low-budget, with interior photography shot on video-tape and location footage shot on 16-mm film (as was common practice for British television productions of the time). Filming commenced in October 1987, with [[Barry Foster (actor)|Barry Foster]] of ''[[Van der Valk (TV series)|Van der Valk]]'' cast in the role of Abberline. Production was halted in December 1987 after the American television network [[CBS]] became interested in the project, and most of the original cast and crew were paid off.\n[[File:Michael Caine - Viennale 2012 g (cropped).jpg|thumb|160px|right|[[Michael Caine]] played [[Frederick Abberline]]]]\n''Jack the Ripper'' was consequently re-tooled as an [[UK|Anglo]]-[[US|American]] co-production with an $11 million budget (provided jointly by [[Thames Television]] and CBS), shot entirely on film. It was decided that a more famous actor would be required to headline the series if it was to sell in the [[United States]], so the role of Abberline was recast with the actor [[Michael Caine]]<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.alamy.com/stock-photo-michael-caine-in-the-film-jack-the-ripper-playing-the-part-of-inspector-20264135.html |title=Michael Caine in the film Jack the ripper playing the part of Inspector fred abberline |access-date=5 September 2018 |work=[[Alamy]] |date=1 September 1998}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/lifestyle/tv/1988/10/16/michael-caine/02b17497-e700-4ea4-9a6d-529ac5204ec1/ |title=Michael Caine |first=Michael E. |last=Hill |date=16 October 1988 |access-date=5 September 2018 |newspaper=[[Washington Post]]}}</ref> - ironically, Foster had earlier replaced Caine in [[Alfred Hitchcock]]'s ''[[Frenzy]]'', when Caine refused to play a serial killer who mutilates women.<ref>{{cite web |first=Kevin |last=Mcgue |url=http://www.alifeatthemovies.com/jack-the-ripper/ |title=Jack the Ripper film review|date=24 April 2010 |work=A Life at the Movies}}</ref> The casting of Michael Caine was considered to be a major coup, as the actor was not known for doing television work. ''Jack the Ripper'' reportedly earned Caine a fee of $1 million.\n\nIn the original version of the series, Abberline's partner George Godley was to have been played by [[Brian Capron]].<ref name=eofftv/><ref>[http://www.eofftv.com/j/jac/jack_the_ripper_1988_main.htm Series background on Eofftv.com] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090511035436/http://www.eofftv.com/j/jac/jack_the_ripper_1988_main.htm |date=11 May 2009 }}</ref> He was replaced by [[Lewis Collins]] who was best known as Bodie in the [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] action series ''[[The Professionals (TV series)|The Professionals]]''. American actor [[Armand Assante]] and British actress [[Jane Seymour (actress)|Jane Seymour]], both well known to American audiences, were added to the cast at the suggestion of CBS. [[Ken Bones]], [[George Sweeney (actor)|George Sweeney]], [[Edward Judd]] and Kelly Cryer all played the parts they were cast for in the unfinished version of the series.\n\n''Jack the Ripper'' began filming in February 1988, with principal photography at [[Pinewood Studios]]. David Wickes was determined that as few people as possible should know who would be unmasked as the killer, and shot four dummy endings (revealing George Lusk, Inspector Spratling, Chief Superintendent Arnold and Sir Charles Warren as the Ripper) to put the cast and crew off the scent. He also mocked up a scene with Godley pulling William Gull from a coach in a case of mistaken identity, and then edited them all together to produce the end result. Reportedly, only eight members of Wickes' staff knew the truth before production wrapped.<ref name=eofftv>[http://www.startrader.co.uk/Action%20TV/articles/jtr.htm Action TV Online]</ref>\n\nThe series premiered in the UK on 11 October 1988, and in the USA on 21 October 1988. (The original broadcast thus occurred within the timeframe of the centenary of the Ripper's \"Canonical Five\" murders, 31 August-9 November 1888.) The series enjoyed extremely high ratings on both sides of the Atlantic.<ref name=\"eofftv\"/>\n\nSeveral DVD editions of ''Jack the Ripper'' include, as extra features, [[audio commentary]] by director/co-writer David Wickes and production assistant Sue Davies, and twenty minutes of footage from the original shoot starring [[Barry Foster (actor)|Barry Foster]] and [[Brian Capron]]. The series was released on Blu-ray on 27 March 2017. This edition features two versions of the series over two discs, the first presenting the series in two parts as originally broadcast and in its original 4:3 aspect. The second disc contains the series as one film and in a 16:9 widescreen aspect. The blu-ray release contains the same extras contained in the previous DVD releases.\n\n==Historical accuracy==\n\nThe film contains several historical inaccuracies:\n\nPrince Albert Victor is referred to in the film as The Duke of Clarence, when in fact he did not assume this title until May 1890, two years after the murders.\n\nJane Seymour's character, Emma Prentiss, claims that the illustration she has drawn is for The Strand Magazine, when in fact that publication did exist until 1891.\n\nA photographer is seen photographing the corpse of Annie Chapman at the murder scene. In reality, photographing a murder scene was not common practice at the time and the body was not photographed until being transferred to the mortuary.\n\nAccording to their uniforms, the constables in the film were assigned to 'J' division, whereas Whitechapel was actually 'H' division.\n\nThe film claims that the murderer has cut off the years of Catharine Eddowes. In reality, her ears were left intact, with only the lobe of one ear becoming detached during the transporting of the corpse to the mortuary.\n\nBloodhounds are visible at the scene of Mary Jane Kelly's murder in Miller's Court. While the use of bloodhounds was indeed considered and trialed, they were not actually employed during the investigation.\n\nWhen the body of Mary Jane Kelly is discovered, the view of the corspe through the window is incorrect. It is seen as being face-on, whereas the body was actually side-on, with the head to the right.\n\nSusan George, playing common prostitute Catharine Eddowes is far too well-dressed for a woman of Eddowes' class, clad in a fashionable and expensive 'Bustle' dress.\n\nThe film depicts Frederick Abberline as being transferred to Whitechapel as a form of demotion. In fact, Abberline was re-assigned to field work from Scotland Yard due to his intimate knowledge of the area, having previously worked there for fourteen years from 1873-1887.\n\n==Reception==\n===Awards===\n''Jack the Ripper'' was nominated for the following awards:\n\n*[[Emmy Award|Emmy]] -1989- Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Miniseries or a Special: [[Armand Assante]] Nominated\n*[[Golden Globe Award|Golden Globe]] -1989- Best Performance by an Actor in a Mini-Series or Motion Picture Made for TV: [[Michael Caine]] Won (Award Tied)\n*Golden Globe -1989- Best Performance by an Actor in a Supporting Role in a Series, Mini-Series or Motion Picture Made for TV: [[Armand Assante]] Nominated\n\n==See also==\n*''[[Murder by Decree]]''\n*''[[From Hell (film)]]''\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{IMDb title|id=0095388|title=Jack the Ripper}}\n*{{amg title|25712|Jack the Ripper}}\n*[http://www.eofftv.com/review/j/jack_the_ripper_1988_review.htm Review on Eofftv.com]\n\n{{Jack the Ripper media}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Jack the Ripper (1988 Tv Series)}}\n[[Category:1988 British television series debuts]]\n[[Category:1988 British television series endings]]\n[[Category:1980s British drama television series]]\n[[Category:1980s British television miniseries]]\n[[Category:ITV television dramas]]\n[[Category:Films set in 1888]]\n[[Category:Television series about Jack the Ripper]]\n[[Category:Television series by Warner Bros.

The story of Jekyll and Hyde is a plot-point in Wickes' ''Jack the Ripper'' series.\n\nUsing historical characters involved in the genuine 1888 hunt for the killer, ''Jack the Ripper'' was written by [[Derek Marlowe]] and David Wickes and [[film director|directed]] by Wickes. The series drew heavily on the same discredited [[Freemasonry|Masonic]]/[[British Royal Family|Royal Family]] [[Jack the Ripper: The Final Solution#Claims of Thomas Stowell|conspiracy theory]] as the 1978 film ''[[Murder By Decree]]''; it is also the account presented in the 2001 film ''[[From Hell (film)|From Hell]]''. This theory was first put forward in the 1960s by [[Thomas E. A. Stowell]] who published his claims in a November 1970 issue of ''The Criminologist''.<ref>Stowell, T. E. A. (November 1970) \"Jack the Ripper&nbsp;\u2013 A Solution?\". ''The Criminologist'' vol.5 pp.40\u201351</ref> The theory was later turned into the bestselling ''[[Jack the Ripper: The Final Solution]]'' (1976) by [[Stephen Knight (author)|Stephen Knight]]. The 1988 series dispenses with the fictional [[Sherlock Holmes]] who uncovered the conspiracy in ''Murder By Decree'' and instead concentrates on the real-life [[Whitechapel]] detective [[Frederick Abberline]], as assisted by Sergeant [[George Godley]].<ref name=eoff>[http://www.eofftv.com/review/j/jack_the_ripper_1988_review.htm ''Jack the Ripper'' reviewed on Eofftv.com]</ref>\n\nThe series is constructed as a [[Whodunit]] in which viewers are led to suspect, at various points, that [[Prince Albert Victor, Duke of Clarence and Avondale|Prince Albert Victor]], [[Richard Mansfield]], [[George Lusk]], Henry Llewellyn or [[Theodore Dyke Acland]] could be Jack the Ripper. Before ''Jack the Ripper'' was broadcast, director/co-writer David Wickes claimed that he had been allowed unprecedented access to the [[Scotland Yard]] files on the [[Jack the Ripper|Ripper]] case and stated that his production would be revealing the 'true' identity of Jack the Ripper for the first time. After pressure from [[Ripperologist]] [[Melvin Harris]] and others, Wickes was forced to withdraw this claim.<ref name=eoff/> Nevertheless, the series begins with a disclaimer on behalf of the production staff, stating, ''\"Our story is based on extensive research, including a review of the official files by special permission of the [[Home Office]] and interviews with leading criminologists and Scotland Yard officials.\"'' The series' \"revelation\" that [[Sir William Gull, 1st Baronet|Sir William Gull]] was Jack the Ripper was not new: Stephen Knight's 1976 book alleged that Gull was the Ripper, and prior to that, the theory had been cited in the 1973 [[BBC]] TV series ''[[Jack the Ripper (1973 TV series)|Jack the Ripper]]'' (two episodes of which were directed by David Wickes). Furthermore, the Ripper character in the film ''Murder by Decree'', assigned the fictitious name \"Sir Thomas Spivey,\" was based on Sir William Gull.\n\nMarlowe and Wickes retained ''The Final Solution''{{'}}s contention that William Gull was Jack the Ripper, but dispensed with most of the rest of the theory: the involvement of Prince Albert Victor is dismissed as a [[Red herring]]; there is no mention of [[Walter Sickert]], Annie Crook, an illegitimate Royal baby, blackmail, or [[Freemasons]]; and the explanation given for the murders is [[dementia]], acquired by Gull from a [[stroke]]. The original script adhered more closely to ''The Final Solution'' but was changed during the course of production: interviewed in 2017, [[Jane Seymour (actress)|Jane Seymour]] stated \"when we first got the script, they kind of implicated the Masons as being involved, and by the time we finished the movie, there was pretty much no mention of the Masons.\"<ref name=\"Harris\">{{cite web |first=Will |last=Harris |url=http://www.avclub.com/article/jane-seymour-how-dr-quinn-was-not-supposed-last-an-253538 |title=Jane Seymour on how Dr. Quinn was not supposed to last and her \"whole new career\" in comedy|date=17 April 2017 |work=[[The A.V. Club]]}}</ref>\n\nThe series ends with Gull's son-in-law, Dr. Theodore Dyke Acland, theorising that Gull was using himself as a case-study of [[multiple personality disorder]] (giving free rein to his murderous impulses in an effort to understand his own multi-faceted mind). The series presents Gull acting of his own accord (with only coachman [[John Netley]] complicit in his crimes), and conspiracy only coming into play ''after'' Gull's arrest: according to the series, Gull's murders were covered up at the behest of police commissioner [[Sir Charles Warren]] to avoid a scandal, as Gull was [[Queen Victoria]]'s physician. The series' denouement thus differs to Stephen Knight's claim that Warren was aware of the Ripper's identity as the crimes were being committed.\n\n''Jack the Ripper'' ends with the following disclaimer:\n\n{{cquote|''In the strange case of Jack the Ripper, there was no trial and no signed confession.''\n\n''In 1888, neither fingerprinting nor bloodtyping was in use and no conclusive forensic, documentary or eye-witness testimony was available. Thus, positive proof of the Ripper\u2019s identity is not available.''\n\n''We have come to our conclusions after careful study and painstaking deduction. Other researchers, criminologists and writers may take a different view.''\n\n''We believe our conclusions to be true.''}}\n\nThe series was originally mounted on a relatively low-budget, with interior photography shot on video-tape and location footage shot on 16-mm film (as was common practice for British television productions of the time). Filming commenced in October 1987, with [[Barry Foster (actor)|Barry Foster]] of ''[[Van der Valk (TV series)|Van der Valk]]'' cast in the role of Abberline. Production was halted in December 1987 after the American television network [[CBS]] became interested in the project, and most of the original cast and crew were paid off.\n[[File:Michael Caine - Viennale 2012 g (cropped).jpg|thumb|160px|right|[[Michael Caine]] played [[Frederick Abberline]]]]\n''Jack the Ripper'' was consequently re-tooled as an [[UK|Anglo]]-[[US|American]] co-production with an $11 million budget (provided jointly by [[Thames Television]] and CBS), shot entirely on film. It was decided that a more famous actor would be required to headline the series if it was to sell in the [[United States]], so the role of Abberline was recast with the actor [[Michael Caine]]<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.alamy.com/stock-photo-michael-caine-in-the-film-jack-the-ripper-playing-the-part-of-inspector-20264135.html |title=Michael Caine in the film Jack the ripper playing the part of Inspector fred abberline |access-date=5 September 2018 |work=[[Alamy]] |date=1 September 1998}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/lifestyle/tv/1988/10/16/michael-caine/02b17497-e700-4ea4-9a6d-529ac5204ec1/ |title=Michael Caine |first=Michael E. |last=Hill |date=16 October 1988 |access-date=5 September 2018 |newspaper=[[Washington Post]]}}</ref> - ironically, Foster had earlier replaced Caine in [[Alfred Hitchcock]]'s ''[[Frenzy]]'', when Caine refused to play a serial killer who mutilates women.<ref>{{cite web |first=Kevin |last=Mcgue |url=http://www.alifeatthemovies.com/jack-the-ripper/ |title=Jack the Ripper film review|date=24 April 2010 |work=A Life at the Movies}}</ref> The casting of Michael Caine was considered to be a major coup, as the actor was not known for doing television work. ''Jack the Ripper'' reportedly earned Caine a fee of $1 million.\n\nIn the original version of the series, Abberline's partner George Godley was to have been played by [[Brian Capron]].<ref name=eofftv/><ref>[http://www.eofftv.com/j/jac/jack_the_ripper_1988_main.htm Series background on Eofftv.com] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090511035436/http://www.eofftv.com/j/jac/jack_the_ripper_1988_main.htm |date=11 May 2009 }}</ref> He was replaced by [[Lewis Collins]] who was best known as Bodie in the [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] action series ''[[The Professionals (TV series)|The Professionals]]''. American actor [[Armand Assante]] and British actress [[Jane Seymour (actress)|Jane Seymour]], both well known to American audiences, were added to the cast at the suggestion of CBS. [[Ken Bones]], [[George Sweeney (actor)|George Sweeney]], [[Edward Judd]] and Kelly Cryer all played the parts they were cast for in the unfinished version of the series.\n\n''Jack the Ripper'' began filming in February 1988, with principal photography at [[Pinewood Studios]]. David Wickes was determined that as few people as possible should know who would be unmasked as the killer, and shot four dummy endings (revealing George Lusk, Inspector Spratling, Chief Superintendent Arnold and Sir Charles Warren as the Ripper) to put the cast and crew off the scent. He also mocked up a scene with Godley pulling William Gull from a coach in a case of mistaken identity, and then edited them all together to produce the end result. Reportedly, only eight members of Wickes' staff knew the truth before production wrapped.<ref name=eofftv>[http://www.startrader.co.uk/Action%20TV/articles/jtr.htm Action TV Online]</ref>\n\nThe series premiered in the UK on 11 October 1988, and in the USA on 21 October 1988. (The original broadcast thus occurred within the timeframe of the centenary of the Ripper's \"Canonical Five\" murders, 31 August-9 November 1888.) The series enjoyed extremely high ratings on both sides of the Atlantic.<ref name=\"eofftv\"/>\n\nSeveral DVD editions of ''Jack the Ripper'' include, as extra features, [[audio commentary]] by director/co-writer David Wickes and production assistant Sue Davies, and twenty minutes of footage from the original shoot starring [[Barry Foster (actor)|Barry Foster]] and [[Brian Capron]]. The series was released on Blu-ray on 27 March 2017. This edition features two versions of the series over two discs, the first presenting the series in two parts as originally broadcast and in its original 4:3 aspect. The second disc contains the series as one film and in a 16:9 widescreen aspect. The blu-ray release contains the same extras contained in the previous DVD releases.\n\n==Historical accuracy==\n\nJack the Ripper (1988 TV series) contains several historical inaccuracies:\n\nPrince Albert Victor is referred to in the film as The Duke of Clarence, when in fact he did not assume this title until May 1890, two years after the murders.\n\nJane Seymour's character, Emma Prentiss, claims that the illustration she has drawn is for The Strand Magazine, when in fact that publication did exist until 1891.\n\nA photographer is seen photographing the corpse of Annie Chapman at the murder scene. In reality, photographing a murder scene was not common practice at the time and the body was not photographed until being transferred to the mortuary.\n\nAccording to their uniforms, the constables in the film were assigned to 'J' division, whereas Whitechapel was actually 'H' division.\n\nThe film claims that the murderer has cut off the years of Catharine Eddowes. In reality, her ears were left intact, with only the lobe of one ear becoming detached during the transporting of the corpse to the mortuary.\n\nBloodhounds are visible at the scene of Mary Jane Kelly's murder in Miller's Court. While the use of bloodhounds was indeed considered and trialed, they were not actually employed during the investigation.\n\nWhen the body of Mary Jane Kelly is discovered, the view of the corspe through the window is incorrect. It is seen as being face-on, whereas the body was actually side-on, with the head to the right.\n\nSusan George, playing common prostitute Catharine Eddowes is far too well-dressed for a woman of Eddowes' class, clad in a fashionable and expensive 'Bustle' dress.\n\nThe film depicts Frederick Abberline as being transferred to Whitechapel as a form of demotion. In fact, Abberline was re-assigned to field work from Scotland Yard due to his intimate knowledge of the area, having previously worked there for fourteen years from 1873-1887.\n\n==Reception==\n===Awards===\n''Jack the Ripper'' was nominated for the following awards:\n\n*[[Emmy Award|Emmy]] -1989- Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Miniseries or a Special: [[Armand Assante]] Nominated\n*[[Golden Globe Award|Golden Globe]] -1989- Best Performance by an Actor in a Mini-Series or Motion Picture Made for TV: [[Michael Caine]] Won (Award Tied)\n*Golden Globe -1989- Best Performance by an Actor in a Supporting Role in a Series, Mini-Series or Motion Picture Made for TV: [[Armand Assante]] Nominated\n\n==See also==\n*''[[Murder by Decree]]''\n*''[[From Hell (film)]]''\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{IMDb title|id=0095388|title=Jack the Ripper}}\n*{{amg title|25712|Jack the Ripper}}\n*[http://www.eofftv.com/review/j/jack_the_ripper_1988_review.htm Review on Eofftv.com]\n\n{{Jack the Ripper media}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Jack the Ripper (1988 Tv Series)}}\n[[Category:1988 British television series debuts]]\n[[Category:1988 British television series endings]]\n[[Category:1980s British drama television series]]\n[[Category:1980s British television miniseries]]\n[[Category:ITV television dramas]]\n[[Category:Films set in 1888]]\n[[Category:Television series about Jack the Ripper]]\n[[Category:Television series by Warner Bros.
