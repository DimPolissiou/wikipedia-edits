Javier Guti\u00e9rrez]], written by [[David Loucka]], [[Jacob Aaron Estes]] and [[Akiva Goldsman]] and starring [[Matilda Lutz]], [[Alex Roe]], [[Johnny Galecki]], [[Aimee Teegarden]], [[Bonnie Morgan]] and [[Vincent D'Onofrio]]. It is the third installment in [[The Ring (franchise)|''The Ring'' series]], following the previous installments ''[[The Ring (2002 film)|The Ring]]'' (2002) and ''[[The Ring Two]]'' (2005), and is based on elements of ''[[Spiral (Suzuki novel)|Spiral]]'' by [[Koji Suzuki (writer)|K\u00f4ji Suzuki]].\n\n[[Paramount Pictures]] had initially planned a third film, originally titled ''The Ring 3D'', in early 2014, with Guti\u00e9rrez signed to direct the film from a screenplay written by Goldsman, Loucka, and Aaron Estes. [[Principal photography]] began on March 23, 2015, in [[Atlanta]], and wrapped on May 31, 2015. Reshoots took place in July 2016.\n\n''Rings'' was released in the United States on February 3, 2017, and opened #2 in the box office. The film received generally negative reviews from critics, with many criticizing its story, plot points and [[jump scare|jump scares]], but praised Lutz's performance. It has grossed $83{{nbsp}}million worldwide against its $25{{nbsp}}million budget.\n\n== Plot ==\nTen years after the events of [[The Ring (2002 film)|The Ring]], [[Rings (2005 film)|Rings]], and [[The Ring Two]], on an airplane bound for [[Seattle]], a man reveals that he has watched [[Samara Morgan]]'s cursed [[videotape]]. Another passenger reveals she has seen the tape too and asks the man if he made a copy; he replies that he did not. Moments later, Samara causes the airplane to crash.\n\nTwo years later in 2015, college professor Gabriel Brown buys a [[Videocassette recorder|VCR]], discovering the videotape inside. Elsewhere, student Julia sees her boyfriend Holt off to college but grows concerned when he falls out of contact. She is inspired to find him when a panicked girl contacts her, asking for Holt's whereabouts. Julia meets Gabriel and finds a group of people known as the Sevens, who are involved in an experiment involving the cursed video. The group films themselves watching the video before passing the footage to another person called a \"tail\".\n\nJulia recognizes the panicked girl, Skye, who takes her to her apartment to have her watch the video, but Holt warns her not to. Julia locks herself in the bathroom as Samara kills Skye. Holt reveals that he has watched the tape as well and has 12 hours left. Julia watches his copy and when she picks up the phone, she experiences a vision of a door. The phone burns a mark on her hand. Julia's version of the video cannot be copied and contains additional images of a mysterious woman: she realizes they must [[cremate]] Samara's physical remains.\n\nGabriel sends them to Sacrament Valley, where Samara was given a proper burial after the residents of Moesko Island refused to accept the remains.{{refn|group=N|As depicted in the 2002 film ''[[The Ring (2002 film)|The Ring]]''.}} He realizes the mark on Julia's hand is [[Braille]], translates it, and goes to warn them. Julia and Holt find an unmarked tomb, but when they break in, they find it empty. They are caught and taken to a blind man named Galen Burke, who claims Samara's body was entombed by the local priest but a flood came, leading the priest to bury her in a [[potter's field]] outside town.\n\nHeading for the field, Julia and Holt are stopped due to a car crash and learn Gabriel was involved. He tries to warn Julia of his discovery but is killed by a falling [[utility pole]]. After experiencing a vision of Samara's mother Evelyn, Julia and Holt return to town. Julia goes to the church and discovers a hidden chamber beneath the bell tower, finding evidence that Evelyn was imprisoned there while pregnant, held in captivity by the priest after being raped before she escaped eight months into the pregnancy.\n\nJulia visits Burke and explains her findings. He attacks her, revealing he is the priest as well as Samara's biological father, having blinded himself to escape the reach of her powers. Julia pushes him down the stairs, temporarily incapacitating him. Holt rushes to Burke's house, where he is knocked unconscious. Julia discovers Samara's skeleton behind a wall, and Burke tries to strangle her to prevent her from cremating Samara's remains. He claims the cremation would unleash an unspeakable evil upon the world, and that he has killed several people who previously attempted to do the same. Suddenly, a swarm of [[cicada]]s fly in, summoning Samara through Julia's phone. Samara cures Burke's blindness and kills him. Holt recovers and rushes to Julia's aid. That night, he and Julia cremate Samara's corpse, in an attempt to appease her spirit once and for all, and return home.\n\nWhile Julia is in the shower, Holt notices a voicemail from Gabriel, who warns him of the Braille, which Holt begins to translate. In the bathroom, Julia peels away the skin where the mark was, revealing grey skin underneath. She begins to cough up black hair, from which a cicada is born. Meanwhile, Julia's copy of the cursed video is sent to everyone on her contact list, which becomes [[Viral video|viral]], despite Holt's futile attempts to disconnect the computer. As his computer glitches, the Braille translation is revealed to be \"[[resurrection|rebirth]]\", as Samara is reborn in Julia, seeing Samara's face in her mirror instead of her own.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Matilda Lutz]] as Julia\n* [[Alex Roe]] as Holt Anthony\n* [[Johnny Galecki]] as Gabriel Brown\n* [[Vincent D'Onofrio]] as Galen Burke\n* [[Aimee Teegarden]] as Skye Johnston\n* [[Bonnie Morgan]] as [[Sadako Yamamura|Samara Morgan]]\n* Chuck David Willis as Blue\n* Patrick R.

Javier Guti\u00e9rrez]], written by [[David Loucka]], [[Jacob Aaron Estes]] and [[Akiva Goldsman]] and starring [[Matilda Lutz]], [[Alex Roe]], [[Johnny Galecki]], [[Aimee Teegarden]], [[Bonnie Morgan]] and [[Vincent D'Onofrio]]. It is the third installment in [[The Ring (franchise)|''The Ring'' series]], following the previous installments ''[[The Ring (2002 film)|The Ring]]'' (2002) and ''[[The Ring Two]]'' (2005), and is based on elements of ''[[Spiral (Suzuki novel)|Spiral]]'' by [[Koji Suzuki (writer)|K\u00f4ji Suzuki]].\n\n[[Paramount Pictures]] had initially planned a third film, originally titled ''The Ring 3D'', in early 2014, with Guti\u00e9rrez signed to direct the film from a screenplay written by Goldsman, Loucka, and Aaron Estes. [[Principal photography]] began on March 23, 2015, in [[Atlanta]], and wrapped on May 31, 2015. Reshoots took place in July 2016.\n\n''Rings'' was released in the United States on February 3, 2017, and opened #2 in the box office. The film received generally negative reviews from critics, with many criticizing its story, plot points and [[jump scare|jump scares]], but praised Lutz's performance. It has grossed $83{{nbsp}}million worldwide against its $25{{nbsp}}million budget.\n\n== Plot ==\nTen years after the events of [[The Ring (2002 film)|The Ring], [[Rings (2005 film)|Rings]], and [[The Ring Two]], on an airplane bound for [[Seattle]], a man reveals that he has watched [[Samara Morgan]]'s cursed [[videotape]]. Another passenger reveals she has seen the tape too and asks the man if he made a copy; he replies that he did not. Moments later, Samara causes the airplane to crash.\n\nTwo years later in 2015, college professor Gabriel Brown buys a [[Videocassette recorder|VCR]], discovering the videotape inside. Elsewhere, student Julia sees her boyfriend Holt off to college but grows concerned when he falls out of contact. She is inspired to find him when a panicked girl contacts her, asking for Holt's whereabouts. Julia meets Gabriel and finds a group of people known as the Sevens, who are involved in an experiment involving the cursed video. The group films themselves watching the video before passing the footage to another person called a \"tail\".\n\nJulia recognizes the panicked girl, Skye, who takes her to her apartment to have her watch the video, but Holt warns her not to. Julia locks herself in the bathroom as Samara kills Skye. Holt reveals that he has watched the tape as well and has 12 hours left. Julia watches his copy and when she picks up the phone, she experiences a vision of a door. The phone burns a mark on her hand. Julia's version of the video cannot be copied and contains additional images of a mysterious woman: she realizes they must [[cremate]] Samara's physical remains.\n\nGabriel sends them to Sacrament Valley, where Samara was given a proper burial after the residents of Moesko Island refused to accept the remains.{{refn|group=N|As depicted in the 2002 film ''[[The Ring (2002 film)|The Ring]]''.}} He realizes the mark on Julia's hand is [[Braille]], translates it, and goes to warn them. Julia and Holt find an unmarked tomb, but when they break in, they find it empty. They are caught and taken to a blind man named Galen Burke, who claims Samara's body was entombed by the local priest but a flood came, leading the priest to bury her in a [[potter's field]] outside town.\n\nHeading for the field, Julia and Holt are stopped due to a car crash and learn Gabriel was involved. He tries to warn Julia of his discovery but is killed by a falling [[utility pole]]. After experiencing a vision of Samara's mother Evelyn, Julia and Holt return to town. Julia goes to the church and discovers a hidden chamber beneath the bell tower, finding evidence that Evelyn was imprisoned there while pregnant, held in captivity by the priest after being raped before she escaped eight months into the pregnancy.\n\nJulia visits Burke and explains her findings. He attacks her, revealing he is the priest as well as Samara's biological father, having blinded himself to escape the reach of her powers. Julia pushes him down the stairs, temporarily incapacitating him. Holt rushes to Burke's house, where he is knocked unconscious. Julia discovers Samara's skeleton behind a wall, and Burke tries to strangle her to prevent her from cremating Samara's remains. He claims the cremation would unleash an unspeakable evil upon the world, and that he has killed several people who previously attempted to do the same. Suddenly, a swarm of [[cicada]]s fly in, summoning Samara through Julia's phone. Samara cures Burke's blindness and kills him. Holt recovers and rushes to Julia's aid. That night, he and Julia cremate Samara's corpse, in an attempt to appease her spirit once and for all, and return home.\n\nWhile Julia is in the shower, Holt notices a voicemail from Gabriel, who warns him of the Braille, which Holt begins to translate. In the bathroom, Julia peels away the skin where the mark was, revealing grey skin underneath. She begins to cough up black hair, from which a cicada is born. Meanwhile, Julia's copy of the cursed video is sent to everyone on her contact list, which becomes [[Viral video|viral]], despite Holt's futile attempts to disconnect the computer. As his computer glitches, the Braille translation is revealed to be \"[[resurrection|rebirth]]\", as Samara is reborn in Julia, seeing Samara's face in her mirror instead of her own.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Matilda Lutz]] as Julia\n* [[Alex Roe]] as Holt Anthony\n* [[Johnny Galecki]] as Gabriel Brown\n* [[Vincent D'Onofrio]] as Galen Burke\n* [[Aimee Teegarden]] as Skye Johnston\n* [[Bonnie Morgan]] as [[Sadako Yamamura|Samara Morgan]]\n* Chuck David Willis as Blue\n* Patrick R.

Both newspapers published articles and a pixelated image between 12 and 19 February 2006 of what they claimed were a [[Premier League|Premiership]] [[Association football|footballer]] and a famous [[DJ]] engaging in a sex act with a [[mobile phone]] at a \"gay orgy\" with one using the headline \"Gay as You Go\". A week later ''PinkNews'' published what was claimed to be the [[Pixelation|unpixelated]] image from the [[Choice FM]] website superimposed on one from the printed articles in the newspapers, allegedly revealing the footballer as [[Ashley Cole]] and the DJ as Choice FM's Ian Thompson (DJ Masterstepz). Cole began legal action against both newspapers for libel, harassment and \"false privacy\" but not against ''PinkNews'', who had never made claims that either were gay. ''PinkNews'' claimed they were trying to expose the tactics of the ''NotW'' rather than \"[[Outing|out]]\" anyone but this backfired as both newspapers threatened to sue under the [[Theft Act 1978|Civil Liability Act]].\nCole's solicitors set up an online survey to investigate the impact, questioning respondents as to where they heard the story and if they discussed it in any forums. ''[[RWD Magazine]]'' allegedly had their forums shut down because of this.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}}\n\nMonths later the ''NotW'' and ''The Sun'' agreed to pay damages of \u00a3100,000, which would have closed ''PinkNews'', had they been [[Indictment|indicted]], and an apology was printed in the ''NotW'' stating: \"Although the photograph was pixelated some readers have understood Mr Cole to be one of the footballers and Masterstepz to be the DJ concerned. We are happy to make clear that Mr Cole and Masterstepz were not involved in any such activities. We apologise to them for any distress caused and we will be paying them each a sum in the way of damages.\" News International confirmed afterwards they would not be seeking damages from ''PinkNews''.<ref>{{cite web|last=Park |first=James |url=http://www.pinknews.co.uk/2011/07/09/how-the-news-of-the-world-threatened-pinknews-after-ashley-cole-expose/ |title=How the News of the World threatened PinkNews after Ashley Cole expose |publisher=PinkNews.co.uk |date= |accessdate=22 May 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pressgazette.co.uk/story.asp?storycode=33515 |title=News of the World could sue website over Cole \"gay orgy\" story |publisher=Press Gazette |date=17 March 2006 |accessdate=22 May 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.journalism.co.uk/news/gay-news-site-threatened-if-ashley-cole-suit-succeeds/s2/a51765/ |title=Gay news site threatened if Ashley Cole suit succeeds &#124; Media news |publisher=Journalism.co.uk |date=16 March 2006 |accessdate=22 May 2012}}</ref>\n\n==Relationship with Stonewall==\n''PinkNews'' reported heavily on the refusal of [[Stonewall (charity)|Stonewall]], an LGBT rights group, to actively campaign for marriage equality.<ref name=\"What does Stonewall want if it isn\u2019t gay marriage?\"/> Stonewall's Chief Executive [[Ben Summerskill]] suggested \"it would cost a staggering \u00a35 billion to implement\", a figure later seized upon by opponents of equality despite its lack of factual basis. The rift came to a head at Liberal Democrats conference in 2010, where Summerskill argued that \"there are lots of lesbians who actually don't want marriage\". The event was attended by [[Lynne Featherstone]], the minister for equality; [[Evan Harris]], president of Liberal Democrat LGBT group [[LGBT+ Liberal Democrats|DELGA]]; and [[Steve Gilbert]], the Lib Dem MP, all of which said they support same-sex marriage. A poll commissioned by ''PinkNews'' and answered by more than 800 of their readership found 98% in support of marriage equality, with many comments calling for Summerskill's resignation.<ref name=\"What does Stonewall want if it isn\u2019t gay marriage?\"/> Stonewall was also criticised by a former founder, [[Michael Cashman|Michael Cashman, MEP]], over its policy.<ref name=\"What does Stonewall want if it isn\u2019t gay marriage?\">{{cite news|last=Reeves|first=Andrew|title=What does Stonewall want if it isn\u2019t gay marriage?|url=http://www.libdemvoice.org/stonewall-gay-marriage-21378.html|accessdate=11 January 2013|newspaper=LibDemVoice.org|date=28 September 2010}}</ref>\n\nSummerskill later accused ''PinkNews'' of running an \"unethical campaign\u201d against Stonewall after asking every LGBT organisation and political group to outline their stance on the issue, with only Stonewall refusing to comment. In October 2010, Stonewall revised its policy and agreed to support same-sex marriage, stating \"Stonewall is pleased to be widening its campaigning objectives to include extending the legal form of marriage to gay people\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.petertatchell.net/lgbt_rights/partnerships/stonewall-undermines-campaign-for-gay-marriage.htm |archive-url=https://www.webarchive.org.uk/wayback/archive/20101204165931/http://www.petertatchell.net/lgbt_rights/partnerships/stonewall-undermines-campaign-for-gay-marriage.htm |url-status=dead |archive-date=4 December 2010 |title=Stonewall undermines campaign for gay marriage |publisher=Peter Tatchell |accessdate=22 May 2012 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Geen |first=Jessica |url=http://www.pinknews.co.uk/2010/10/27/stonewall-says-it-will-campaign-for-gay-marriage/ |title=Stonewall says it will campaign for gay marriage |publisher=PinkNews.co.uk |date= |accessdate=22 May 2012}}</ref>\n\n''PinkNews'' also regularly reported on criticism of Stonewall for its refusal to campaign on transgender issues.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.pinknews.co.uk/2008/11/07/celebs-split-over-trans-protests-at-stonewall-awards/|title=Celebs split over trans protest at Stonewall Awards|work=PinkNews|access-date=12 October 2017|language=en-UK}}</ref> PinkNews has collaborated closely with Stonewall following the departure of Summerskill in 2014.

Both newspapers published articles and a pixelated image between 12 and 19 February 2006 of what they claimed were a [[Premier League|Premiership]] [[Association football|footballer]] and a famous [[DJ]] engaging in a sex act with a [[mobile phone]] at a \"gay orgy\" with one using the headline \"Gay as You Go\". A week later ''PinkNews'' published what was claimed to be the [[Pixelation|unpixelated]] image from the [[Choice FM]] website superimposed on one from the printed articles in the newspapers, allegedly revealing the footballer as [[Ashley Cole]] and the DJ as Choice FM's Ian Thompson (DJ Masterstepz). Cole began legal action against both newspapers for libel, harassment and \"false privacy\" but not against ''PinkNews'', who had never made claims that either were gay. ''PinkNews'' claimed they were trying to expose the tactics of the ''NotW'' rather than \"[[Outing|out]]\" anyone but this backfired as both newspapers threatened to sue under the [[Theft Act 1978|Civil Liability Act]].\nCole's solicitors set up an online survey to investigate the impact, questioning respondents as to where they heard the story and if they discussed it in any forums. ''[[RWD Magazine]]'' allegedly had their forums shut down because of this.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}}\n\nMonths later the ''NotW'' and ''The Sun'' agreed to pay damages of \u00a3100,000, which would have closed ''PinkNews'', had they been [[Indictment|indicted]], and an apology was printed in the ''NotW'' stating: \"Although the photograph was pixelated some readers have understood Mr Cole to be one of the footballers and Masterstepz to be the DJ concerned. We are happy to make clear that Mr Cole and Masterstepz were not involved in any such activities.

The rift came to a head at Liberal Democrats conference in 2010, where Summerskill argued that \"there are lots of lesbians who actually don't want marriage\". The event was attended by [[Lynne Featherstone]], the minister for equality; [[Evan Harris]], president of Liberal Democrat LGBT group [[LGBT+ Liberal Democrats|DELGA]]; and [[Steve Gilbert]], the Lib Dem MP, all of which said they support same-sex marriage. A poll commissioned by ''PinkNews'' and answered by more than 800 of their readership found 98% in support of marriage equality, with many comments calling for Summerskill's resignation.<ref name=\"What does Stonewall want if it isn\u2019t gay marriage?\"/> Stonewall was also criticised by a former founder, [[Michael Cashman|Michael Cashman, MEP]], over its policy.<ref name=\"What does Stonewall want if it isn\u2019t gay marriage?\">{{cite news|last=Reeves|first=Andrew|title=What does Stonewall want if it isn\u2019t gay marriage?|url=http://www.libdemvoice.org/stonewall-gay-marriage-21378.html|accessdate=11 January 2013|newspaper=LibDemVoice.org|date=28 September 2010}}</ref>\n\nSummerskill later accused ''PinkNews'' of running an \"unethical campaign\u201d against Stonewall after asking every LGBT organisation and political group to outline their stance on the issue, with only Stonewall refusing to comment.

{"title_page": "Bodymind", "text_new": "{{refimprove|date=April 2019}}\n{{npov|date=April 2019}}\n\n'''Bodymind''' is an approach to understand the relationship between the human [[Human body|body]] and [[mind]] where they are seen as a single integrated unit. It attempts to address the [[mind\u2013body problem]] and resists the Western traditions of [[mind\u2013body dualism]]. The term bodymind is also typically seen and encountered in [[disability studies]], referring to the intricate and often times inseparable relationship between the body and the mind, and how these two units might act as one. The field of [[psychosomatic medicine]] investigates the embodied manifestations of psychological processes.  \n\n== Dualism vs holism ==\nIn the field of philosophy, the theory of dualism is the speculation that the mental and the physical parts of us- like our minds and our bodies- are different or separate.<ref>{{Citation|last=Robinson|first=Howard|title=Dualism|date=2017|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2017/entries/dualism/|work=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|editor-last=Zalta|editor-first=Edward N.|edition=Fall 2017|publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University|access-date=2020-04-10}}</ref> Holism is the idea or speculation that all the properties of a system- such as the system of our thoughts, and the system of our body- cannot be determined or explained by looking at its components individually. Rather, the whole system looked at a complete whole is a determiner in understanding and viewing the idea, concept, or theory being questioned.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.philosophybasics.com/branch_metaphysics.html|title=Metaphysics - By Branch / Doctrine - The Basics of Philosophy|website=www.philosophybasics.com|access-date=2020-04-10}}</ref>\n\nOn the Western side of the globe, popular culture tends to be more on the side that there are two centers of our being that makes us who we are and how we see and interact with the world. The first is the mind \u2013 the center of our thoughts, and the heart (or body) \u2013 which is the center of our feelings. In Western culture, there is more of a debate on whether these different parts that make us unique are sperate or connected.\n\nIn Eastern culture, especially in areas such as and surrounding India and the Middle East, the idea of body-mind is the exact opposite. The words \u201cmind\u201d and \u201cheart\u2019 both translate into \u201cchitta,\u201d which refers to the mind. \u201cChitta\u201d is one of the three overlapping terms used that refers to the mind. The other two are \u201cmanas\u201d and \u00a0\u201c[[vi\u00f1\u00f1\u0101\u1e47a]].\u201d Together, they are parts that make up the whole or entirety of our minds, and our mental processes as a whole. Often used in practices such as yoga, commonly used and followed in more \u201cself-help\u201d medicines, In the Indian model, this heart-mind has three aspects: the capability of paying attention and sensory processing, the creation of our identity or self-image (more commonly known as Ego), and the capacity to imagine things, form judgements, and making decisions.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.embodiedphilosophy.com/on-the-mind-the-difference-between-eastern-and-western-conceptions/|title=On the Mind: the Difference between Eastern and Western Conceptions|date=2017-08-14|website=#embodiedphilosophy|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-10}}</ref>\n\n== Historical background ==\nAn important figure in the concept and belief of body-mind is an American philosopher, scholar, and professor of philosophy, religion, and culture, William H. Poteat (19 April, 1919 \u2013 17 May 2000). Throughout the course of his lifetime, Poteat was known for his great contributions to Post-Critical Philosophy and for being the leader of formative and influential ideas such as \u201cbodymind.\u201d<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://whpoteat.org/|title=whpoteat.org|website=whpoteat.org|access-date=2020-04-10}}</ref> As a man who emphasized in philosophy, it is said he identified himself as a \u201c\u201d practicing dialectician.\u201d He was known to encourage and challenge not only himself, but those around him, to question, understand, and challenge the reasoning and facts of the confusing aspects of modern life. Poteat drew his inspirations and ideas from Michael Polanyi, who wrote \u201cThe Stability of Beliefs\u201d in 1952. In this essay, Polanyi spoke about how there are two ways of holding beliefs. He stated, \u201cSome are held by the explicit profession of certain articles of faith, as the Apostles\u2019 Creed when recited in the words of the Book of Common Prayer. The other form of belief is held implicitly by reliance on a particular conceptual framework by which all experience is interpreted.\u201d<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Polanyi|first=Michael|date=1952|title=The Stability of Beliefs|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/685265|journal=The British Journal for the Philosophy of Science|volume=3|issue=11|pages=217\u2013232|issn=0007-0882}}</ref> Other influential people Poteat looked to for further inspiration were the Danish philosopher S\u00f8ren Kierkegaard (1813-1855), a man considered to be the first existential philosopher (philosophy that emphasizes individual existence, freedom, and choice), the Austrian-British philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein (1889-1951), the French philosopher Maurice Merleau-Ponty (1908\u20131961), and Hannah Arendt (1906-1975), a German-American philosopher and political theorist and many others. Together, these people and their ideas, along with Poteat\u2019s own ideas and theories, helped him further understand and share the concept and ideas of what bodymind is in today\u2019s modern world.\n\n== Bodymind and religion ==\nThe approach to bodymind is believed in and viewed through multiple faiths and practices. These include Vajrayana, Mahayana, Theravada, and Zen Buddhism. Like many religions today, these different branches of Buddhism originate from the same root and tree. They have very similar ideas and beliefs, but there are differences in the way they practice and live their beliefs. However, in each of their faiths, the concept of bodymind, otherwise known as namarupa, is key. Another similarity that all the different branches of Buddhism share is the daily practice of \u201cSila\u201d \u201cSamhdai,\u201d and \u201cPrajna.\u201d The idea and practice of Buddhism originated in India, and is now practiced throughout the world. The core teachings of Buddhism are the Three Universal Truths, The Four Noble Truths, and The Noble Eightfold Path.\n\nThe three Noble Truths are: Nothing is lost in the universe, everything changes, and the law of cause and effect. The Four Noble Truths are: suffering exists (Dukkha), there is a cause of suffering (Samudaya), there is an end to suffering (Nirodha), and in order to end suffering, you must follow the Eightfold Path (Magga). Finally, the Eightfold Path consists of the following:\n\n1) \u00a0 Right understanding of the Four Noble Truths\n\n2) \u00a0 Right thinking\n\n3) \u00a0 Right speech\n\n4) \u00a0 Right conduct or action\n\n5) \u00a0 Right livelihood\n\n6) \u00a0 Right effort\n\n7) \u00a0 Right mindfulness\n\n8) \u00a0 Right concentration\n\nBuddhism is one of the main ways in which we can view and more fully understand the bodymind approach- especially in today\u2019s modern world of many different advancements, ideas, and beliefs.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.unhcr.org/|title=UNHCR\u00a0- The UN Refugee Agency|website=www.unhcr.org|access-date=2020-04-10}}</ref>\n\n== Modern understanding ==\n\u201cThe mind is composed of mental fragments- sensations, feelings, thoughts, imaginations, all flowing now in an ordered sequence, now in a chaotic fashion\u2026. On the other hand, the body is constructed under the underlying laws of physics, and its components obey the well-enumerated laws of physiology. It is these characteristic differences between these two \u2013 between mind and body \u2013 that lead to the Mind-Body problem.\" <ref>{{Cite journal|last=Taylor|first=John G.|date=2010-10-28|title=Mind-body problem: New approaches|url=http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Mind-body_problem:_New_approaches|journal=Scholarpedia|language=en|volume=5|issue=10|pages=1580|doi=10.4249/scholarpedia.1580|issn=1941-6016}}</ref>There is still no concrete evidence if the mind has more impact on who we are, or of our bodies do. While the Western population tends to believe more in the idea of dualism, there is no reason to not believe the idea of holism. Many throughout the world who try to understand and live the idea of holism, say they feel more connected with themselves, with the environment, and with those around them. If anything, bodymind shows the significance of connected everything is- both in and outside ourselves. Bodymind is brought up in many different situations today in the modern world- especially in modern and alternative medicines.\n\n==Relevance to alternative medicine==\nIn the field of [[alternative medicine]], bodymind implies that \n* The body, mind, emotions, and spirit are dynamically interrelated.<ref>{{Cite book|title = The Feeling of What Happens: Body and Emotion in the Making of Consciousness|last = Damasio|first = Antonio|publisher = Houghton Mifflin Harcourt|year = 2000|isbn = 978-0156010757|location = |pages = |url-access = registration|url = https://archive.org/details/feelingofwhathap00dama_0}}</ref>\n* Experience, including physical stress, emotional injury, and pleasures are stored in the body's cells which in turn affects one's reactions to stimuli.<ref>Keleman, Stanley: ''Your Body speaks its Mind'', Center Press (US) (1989) {{ISBN|978-0934320016}} </ref>\nThe term can be   a number of disciplines, including:\n* [[Psychoneuroimmunology]], the study of the interaction between psychological processes and the nervous and immune systems of the human body.<ref>{{cite book | last = Michael Irwin| first = Kavita Vedhara | title = Human Psychoneuroimmunology| publisher = Oxford University Press|year=2005| isbn = 978-0-19-856884-1}}</ref>\n* [[Body psychotherapy]],<ref>Totton, N.

It attempts to address the [[mind\u2013body problem]] and resists the Western traditions of [[mind\u2013body dualism]].The term bodymind is also typically seen and encountered in [[disability studies]], referring to the intricate and often times inseparable relationship between the body and the mind, and how these two units might act as one. The field of [[psychosomatic medicine]] investigates the embodied manifestations of psychological processes.  \n\n== Dualism vs holism ==\nIn the field of philosophy, the theory of dualism is the speculation that the mental and the physical parts of us- like our minds and our bodies- are different or separate.<ref>{{Citation|last=Robinson|first=Howard|title=Dualism|date=2017|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2017/entries/dualism/|work=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|editor-last=Zalta|editor-first=Edward N.|edition=Fall 2017|publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University|access-date=2020-04-10}}</ref> Holism is the idea or speculation that all the properties of a system- such as the system of our thoughts, and the system of our body- cannot be determined or explained by looking at it\u2019s components individually. Rather, the whole system looked at a complete whole is a determiner in understanding and viewing the idea, concept, or theory being questioned.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.philosophybasics.com/branch_metaphysics.html|title=Metaphysics - By Branch / Doctrine - The Basics of Philosophy|website=www.philosophybasics.com|access-date=2020-04-10}}</ref>\n\nOn the Western side of the globe, popular culture tends to be more on the side that there are two centers of our being that make us who we are and how we see and interact with the world. The first is the mind- the center of our thoughts, and the heart (or body)- which is the center of our feelings. In Western culture, there is more of a debate on whether these different parts that make us unique are sperate or connected.\n\nIn Eastern culture, especially in areas such as and surrounding India and the Middle East, the idea of body mind is the exact opposite. The words \u201cmind\u201d and \u201cheart\u2019 both translate into \u201cchitta,\u201d which refers to the mind. \u201cChitta\u201d is one of the three overlapping terms used that refers to the mind. The other two are \u201cmanas\u201d and \u00a0\u201c[[vi\u00f1\u00f1\u0101\u1e47a]].\u201d Together, they are parts that make up the whole or entirety of our minds, and our mental processes as a whole. Often used in practices such as yoga, commonly used and followed in more \u201cself-help\u201d medicines, In the Indian model, this heart-mind has three aspects: the capability of paying attention and sensory processing, the creation of our identity or self-image (more commonly known as Ego), and the capacity to imagine things, form judgements, and making decisions.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.embodiedphilosophy.com/on-the-mind-the-difference-between-eastern-and-western-conceptions/|title=On the Mind: the Difference between Eastern and Western Conceptions|date=2017-08-14|website=#embodiedphilosophy|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-10}}</ref>\n\n== Historical background ==\nAn important figure in the concept and belief of body mind is an American philosopher, scholar, and professor of philosophy, religion, and culture, William H. Poteat (19 April, 1919 \u2013 17 May 2000). Throughout the course of his lifetime, Poteat was known for his great contributions to Post-Critical Philosophy and for being the leader of formative and influential ideas such as \u201cbody mind.\u201d<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://whpoteat.org/|title=whpoteat.org|website=whpoteat.org|access-date=2020-04-10}}</ref> As a man who emphasized in philosophy, it is said he identified himself as a \u201c\u201d practicing dialectician.\u201d He was known to encourage and challenge not only himself, but those around him, to question, understand, and challenge the reasoning and facts of the confusing aspects of modern life. Poteat drew his inspirations and ideas from Michael Polanyi, who wrote \u201cThe Stability of Beliefs\u201d in 1952. In this essay, Polanyi spoke about how there are two ways of holding beliefs. He stated, \u201cSome are held by the explicit profession of certain articles of faith, as the Apostles\u2019 Creed when recited in the words of the Book of Common Prayer. The other form of belief is held implicitly by reliance on a particular conceptual framework by which all experience is interpreted.\u201d<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Polanyi|first=Michael|date=1952|title=The Stability of Beliefs|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/685265|journal=The British Journal for the Philosophy of Science|volume=3|issue=11|pages=217\u2013232|issn=0007-0882}}</ref> Other influential people Poteat looked to for further inspiration were the Danish philosopher S\u00f8ren Kierkegaard (1813-1855), a man considered to be the first existential philosopher (philosophy that emphasizes individual existence, freedom, and choice), the Austrian-British philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein (1889-1951), the French philosopher Maurice Merleau-Ponty (1908-1961), and Hannah Arendt (1906-1975), a German-American philosopher and political theorist and many others. Together, these people and their ideas, along with Poteat\u2019s own ideas and theories, helped him further understand and share the concept and ideas of what body mind is in today\u2019s modern world.\n\n== Bodymind and religion ==\nThe approach to body mind is believed in and viewed through multiple faiths and practices. These include Vajrayana, Mahayana, Theravada, and Zen Buddhism. Like many religions today, these different branches of Buddhism originate from the same root and tree. They have very similar ideas and beliefs, but there are differences in the way they practice and live their beliefs. However, in each of their faiths, the concept of bodymind, otherwise known as namarupa, is key. Another similarity that all the different branches of Buddhism share is the daily practice of \u201cSila\u201d \u201cSamhdai,\u201d and \u201cPrajna.\u201d The idea and practice of Buddhism originated in India, and is now practiced throughout the world. The core teachings of Buddhism are the Three Universal Truths, The Four Noble Truths, and The Noble Eightfold Path.\n\nThe three Noble Truths are: Nothing is lost in the universe, everything changes, and the law of cause and effect. The Four Noble Truths are: suffering exists (Dukkha), there is a cause of suffering (Samudaya), there is an end to suffering (Nirodha), and in order to end suffering, you must follow the Eightfold Path (Magga). Finally, the Eightfold Path consists of the following:\n\n1) \u00a0 Right understanding of the Four Noble Truths\n\n2) \u00a0 Right thinking\n\n3) \u00a0 Right speech\n\n4) \u00a0 Right conduct or action\n\n5) \u00a0 Right livelihood\n\n6) \u00a0 Right effort\n\n7) \u00a0 Right mindfulness\n\n8) \u00a0 Right concentration\n\nBuddhism is one of the main ways in which we can view and more fully understand the bodymind approach- especially in today\u2019s modern world of many different advancements, ideas, and beliefs.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.unhcr.org/|title=UNHCR\u00a0- The UN Refugee Agency|website=www.unhcr.org|access-date=2020-04-10}}</ref>\n\n== Modern understanding ==\n\u201cThe mind is composed of mental fragments- sensations, feelings, thoughts, imaginations, all flowing now in an ordered sequence, now in a chaotic fashion\u2026. On the other hand, the body is constructed under the underlying laws of physics, and its components obey the well-enumerated laws of physiology. It is these characteristic differences between these two \u2013 between mind and body \u2013 that lead to the Mind-Body problem.\" <ref>{{Cite journal|last=Taylor|first=John G.|date=2010-10-28|title=Mind-body problem: New approaches|url=http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Mind-body_problem:_New_approaches|journal=Scholarpedia|language=en|volume=5|issue=10|pages=1580|doi=10.4249/scholarpedia.1580|issn=1941-6016}}</ref>There is still no concrete evidence if the mind has more impact on who we are, or of our bodies do. While the Western population tends to believe more in the idea of dualism, there is no reason to not believe the idea of holism. Many throughout the world who try to understand and live the idea of holism, say they feel more connected with themselves, with the environment, and with those around them. If anything, bodymind shows the significance of connected everything is- both in and outside ourselves. Bodymind is brought up in many different situations today in the modern world- especially in modern and alternative medicines.\n\n==Relevance to alternative medicine==\nIn the field of [[alternative medicine]], bodymind implies that \n* The body, mind, emotions, and spirit are dynamically interrelated.<ref>{{Cite book|title = The Feeling of What Happens: Body and Emotion in the Making of Consciousness|last = Damasio|first = Antonio|publisher = Houghton Mifflin Harcourt|year = 2000|isbn = 978-0156010757|location = |pages = |url-access = registration|url = https://archive.org/details/feelingofwhathap00dama_0}}</ref>\n* Experience, including physical stress, emotional injury, and pleasures are stored in the body's cells which in turn affects one's reactions to stimuli.<ref>Keleman, Stanley: ''Your Body speaks its Mind'', Center Press (US) (1989) {{ISBN|978-0934320016}} </ref>\nThe term can be   a number of disciplines, including:\n* [[Psychoneuroimmunology]], the study of the interaction between psychological processes and the nervous and immune systems of the human body.<ref>{{cite book | last = Michael Irwin| first = Kavita Vedhara | title = Human Psychoneuroimmunology| publisher = Oxford University Press|year=2005| isbn = 978-0-19-856884-1}}</ref>\n* [[Body psychotherapy]],<ref>Totton, N.

The craft was launched from [[Kennedy Space Center]] on April 11, 1970, but the lunar landing was aborted after an oxygen tank in the [[Apollo command and service module#Service module (SM)|service module]] (SM) failed two days into the mission. The crew instead looped around the Moon, and returned safely to Earth on April 17. The mission was commanded by [[Jim Lovell]] with [[Jack Swigert]] as [[Apollo command and service module#Command module (CM)|command module]] (CM) pilot and [[Fred Haise]] as [[Apollo Lunar Module|lunar module]] (LM) pilot. Swigert was a late replacement for [[Ken Mattingly]], who was grounded after exposure to [[rubella]].\n\nA routine stir of an oxygen tank ignited damaged wire insulation inside it, causing an explosion that vented the contents of both of the SM's oxygen tanks to space. Without oxygen, needed for breathing and for generating electric power, the SM's propulsion and life support systems could not operate. The CM's systems had to be shut down to conserve its remaining resources for reentry, forcing the crew to transfer to the LM as a lifeboat. With the lunar landing canceled, mission controllers worked to bring the crew home alive.\n\nAlthough the LM was designed to support two men on the lunar surface for two days, [[Christopher C. Kraft Jr. Mission Control Center|Mission Control]] in Houston improvised new procedures so it could support three men for four days. The crew experienced great hardship caused by limited power, a chilly and wet cabin and a shortage of [[potable water]]. There was a critical need to adapt the CM's cartridges for the [[carbon dioxide]] removal system to work in the LM; the crew and mission controllers were successful in improvising a solution. The astronauts' peril briefly renewed interest in the Apollo program; tens of millions watched the splashdown in the [[South Pacific Ocean]] on television.\n\nAn investigative review board found fault with preflight testing of the oxygen tank and the fact that [[Teflon]] was placed inside it. The board recommended changes, including minimizing the use of potentially combustible items inside the tank; this was done for [[Apollo 14]].

Apollo&nbsp;13 was on the hybrid trajectory which was to take it to Fra Mauro; it now needed to be brought back to a free return. The LM's [[Descent Propulsion System]] (DPS), although not as powerful as the SPS, could do this, but new software for Mission Control's computers needed to be written by technicians as it had never been contemplated that the CSM/LM spacecraft would have to be maneuvered by the DPS.

Nevertheless, yet another burn was needed at 137:40:13, using the LM's [[reaction control system]] (RCS) thrusters, for 21.5&nbsp;seconds. The SM was jettisoned less than half an hour later, allowing the crew to see the damage for the first time, and photograph it. They reported that an entire panel was missing from the SM's exterior, the fuel cells above the oxygen tank shelf were tilted, that the high-gain antenna was damaged, and there was a considerable amount of debris elsewhere.{{sfn|Orloff & Harland|2006|pp=370\u2013371}} Haise could see damage to the SM's engine bell, validating Kranz's decision not to use the SPS.<ref name = \"Cass 3\" />\n\n[[File:Apollo13 splashdown.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Spaceship contacts ocean under parachute|Apollo&nbsp;13 splashes down in the South Pacific on April 17, 1970]]\n\nThe last problem to be solved was how to separate the lunar module a safe distance away from the command module just before reentry. The normal procedure, in lunar orbit, was to release the LM then use the service module's RCS to pull the CSM away, but by this point the SM had already been released. [[Grumman]], manufacturer of the LM, assigned a team of University of Toronto engineers, led by senior scientist [[Bernard Etkin]], to solve the problem of how much air pressure to use to push the modules apart.

The resulting fire quickly increased pressure inside the tank and the tank dome failed, filling the fuel cell bay (SM Sector{{nbsp}}4) with rapidly expanding gaseous oxygen and combustion products. The escaping gas was probably enough by itself to blow out the aluminum exterior panel to Sector{{nbsp}}4, but combustion products generated as nearby insulation ignited would have added to the pressure. The panel's departure exposed the sector to space, snuffing out the fire, and it probably hit the nearby high-gain antenna, disrupting communications to Earth for 1.8&nbsp;seconds.{{sfn|Orloff & Harland|2006|pp=372\u2013373}} The sectors of the SM were not airtight from each other, and had there been time for the entire SM to become as pressurized as Sector{{nbsp}}4, the force on the CM's heat shield would have separated the two modules.

During removal, the shelf was accidentally dropped at least {{convert|2|in|cm|0|order=flip|sp=us}} because a retaining bolt had not been removed. The probability of damage from this was low, but it is possible that the fill line assembly was loose and made worse by the fall. After some retesting (which did not include filling the tank with liquid oxygen), in November 1968 the shelf was re-installed in SM-109, intended for Apollo&nbsp;13, which was shipped to KSC in June 1969.{{sfn|Accident report|pp=4-19, 4-21}}\n\nThe [[Terminal countdown demonstration test|Countdown Demonstration Test]] took place with SM-109 in its place near the top of the Saturn&nbsp;V and began on March 16, 1970.

After discussion among NASA and the contractors, attempts to empty the tank resumed on March 27. When it would not empty normally, the heaters in the tank were turned on to boil off the oxygen. The thermostatic switches were designed to prevent the heaters from raising the temperature higher than {{convert|80|F|C|order=flip}}, but they failed under the 65-volt power supply applied.

James Lovell, Kranz, and other principals have stated that this film depicted the events of the mission with reasonable accuracy, given that some [[dramatic license]] was taken.

Episodes began airing for Season 2, starting on March 8, 2020, with episode 1, \"Time bomb: Apollo 13\". It chronicles the launch and the electrical issue causing the explosion. Episode 2, details the denial and disbelief of Mission Control to the accident. Episode 3 \"Lifeboat\" examines the decision to turn the lunar service module into a life boat for the crew. Episode 4, \"Power brokers\", examines how engineers try to figure out how to save the mission's limited available power. Episode 5, \"Life support\" dives into how the astronauts were being poisoned by their own carbon dioxyide from their exhalations and how engineers sought to deal with it. Episode 6, \"Earth in view\" is the penultimate episode, which examines how the astronauts navigated the spacecraft as it rapidly approached Earth off course for reentry.  As of April 13, 2020, the final episode has been delayed due to the cornonavirus pandemic. In \"Delay to Episode 7\", the BBC explains that there will be a delay in the final episode since the presenter of the series, Kevin Fong, a medical doctor, has been called into service.<ref>[www.bbcworldservice.com/13 minutes BBC 13 Minutes to the moon] accessed April 13, 2020.</ref>\n\n==Gallery==\n\n<gallery widths=\"200\" heights=\"200\">\n\nFile:ALSEP Ap13-70-HC-77.jpg|Lovell practices deploying the [[ALSEP]] during training\nFile:Apollo 13 Saturn V during rollout.jpg|The Apollo 13 launch vehicle being rolled out, December 1969\nFile:Apollo 13 Mailbox at Mission Control.jpg|The \"mailbox\" at [[Mission Control#NASA Mission Control Center|Mission Control]] during the Apollo&nbsp;13 mission\nFile:Apollo 13 LM undocking (AS13-59-8566) (cropped).jpg|Lunar module ''Aquarius'' after it was jettisoned above the Earth\nFile:Mission Control Celebrates - GPN-2000-001313.jpg|Mission Control celebrates the successful splashdown\nFile:Apollo 13 Astronauts on the U.S.S.

The craft was launched from [[Kennedy Space Center]] on April 11, 1970, but the lunar landing was aborted after an oxygen tank in the [[Apollo command and service module#Service module (SM)|service module]] (SM) failed two days into the mission. The crew instead looped around the Moon, and returned safely to Earth on April 17. The mission was commanded by [[Jim Lovell]] with [[Jack Swigert]] as [[Apollo command and service module#Command module (CM)|command module]] (CM) pilot and [[Fred Haise]] as [[Apollo Lunar Module|lunar module]] (LM) pilot. Swigert was a late replacement for [[Ken Mattingly]], who was grounded after exposure to [[rubella]].\n\nA routine stir of an oxygen tank ignited damaged wire insulation inside it, causing an explosion that vented the contents of both of the SM's oxygen tanks to space. Without oxygen, needed for breathing and for generating electric power, the SM's propulsion and life support systems could not operate. The CM's systems had to be shut down to conserve its remaining resources for reentry, forcing the crew to transfer to the LM as a lifeboat. With the lunar landing canceled, mission controllers worked to bring the crew home alive.\n\nAlthough the LM was designed to support two men on the lunar surface for two days, [[Christopher C. Kraft Jr. Mission Control Center|Mission Control]] in Houston improvised new procedures so it could support three men for four days. The crew experienced great hardship caused by limited power, a chilly and wet cabin and a shortage of [[potable water]]. There was a critical need to adapt the CM's cartridges for the [[carbon dioxide]] removal system to work in the LM; the crew and mission controllers were successful in improvising a solution. The astronauts' peril briefly renewed interest in the Apollo program; tens of millions watched the splashdown in the [[South Pacific Ocean]] on television.\n\nAn investigative review board found fault with preflight testing of the oxygen tank and the fact that [[Teflon]] was placed inside it. The board recommended changes, including minimizing the use of potentially combustible items inside the tank; this was done for [[Apollo 14]]. The story of Apollo&nbsp;13 has been dramatized several times, most notably in the 1995 film ''[[Apollo&nbsp;13 (film)|Apollo&nbsp;13]]''. Most recently for the 50th anniversary of the mission in 2020, the [[BBC]] World Service created a multi-part podcast ''13 Minutes to the Moon''.<ref>[www.bbcworldservice.com/13 minutes BBC World Service, 13 Minustes to the Moon] access April 13, 2020</ref>\n\n{{toc limit|3}}\n\n== Background ==\nIn 1961, U.S. President [[John F. Kennedy]] challenged his nation to land an astronaut on [[the Moon]] by the end of the decade, with a safe return to Earth.<ref name = \"mission overview\" /> [[NASA]] worked towards this goal incrementally, sending astronauts into space during [[Project Mercury]] and [[Project Gemini]], leading up to the [[Apollo program]].{{sfn|Hacker & Grimwood|2010|p=382}} The goal was achieved with [[Apollo 11]], which landed on the Moon on July 20, 1969. [[Neil Armstrong]] and [[Buzz Aldrin]] walked on the lunar surface while [[Michael Collins (astronaut)|Michael Collins]] orbited the Moon in [[Command Module Columbia|Command Module ''Columbia'']].

We've had a Main&nbsp;B Bus undervolt.\"<ref name = \"journal Houston\" />\n\nLovell's initial thought on hearing the noise was that Haise had activated the LM's cabin-repressurization valve, which also produced a bang (Haise enjoyed doing so to startle his crewmates) but Lovell could see that Haise had no idea what had happened. Swigert initially thought that a [[meteoroid]] might have struck the LM, but he and Lovell quickly realized there was no leak.{{sfn|Chaikin|1998|p=293}} The Main Bus&nbsp;B undervolt meant that there was insufficient voltage flowing from the SM's three power cells (fueled by hydrogen and oxygen piped from their respective tanks) to the second of the SM's two electric power distribution systems. Almost everything in the CSM required power. Although the bus momentarily returned to normal status, soon both buses A and B were short on voltage.

But the accident could have damaged the SPS, and the fuel cells would have to last at least another hour to meet its power requirements, so Kranz instead decided on a longer route: the spacecraft would swing around the Moon before heading back to Earth. Apollo&nbsp;13 was on the hybrid trajectory which was to take it to Fra Mauro; it now needed to be brought back to a free return. The LM's [[Descent Propulsion System]] (DPS), although not as powerful as the SPS, could do this, but new software for Mission Control's computers needed to be written by technicians as it had never been contemplated that the CSM/LM spacecraft would have to be maneuvered by the DPS. As the CM was being shut down, Lovell copied down its guidance system's orientation information and performed hand calculations to transfer it to the LM's guidance system, which had been turned off; at his request Mission Control checked his figures.<ref name = \"Cass 2\">{{cite web|last=Cass|first=Stephen|title=Houston, we have a solution, part 2|url=https://spectrum.ieee.org/tech-history/space-age/apollo-13-we-have-a-solution-part-2|date=April 1, 2005|website=IEEE|accessdate=August 31, 2019}}</ref>{{sfn|Chaikin|1998|pp=297\u2013298}} At 61:29:43.49 the DPS burn of 34.23&nbsp;seconds took Apollo&nbsp;13 back to a free return trajectory.{{sfn|Orloff & Harland|2006|p=369}}\n\n[[File:Mare Moscoviense AS13-60-8648.jpg|thumb|The Apollo&nbsp;13 crew photographed the Moon out of the [[Apollo Lunar Module|Lunar Module]].]]\nThe change would get Apollo&nbsp;13 back to Earth in about four days' time{{snd}}though with splashdown in the [[Indian Ocean]], where NASA had few recovery forces.

One option would shave 36 hours off the return time, but required jettisoning the SM; this would expose the CM's heat shield to space during the return journey, something for which it had not been designed. The FIDOs also proposed other solutions. After a meeting involving NASA officials and engineers, the senior individual present, [[Manned Spaceflight Center]] director [[Robert R.

Nonetheless, the switches Beech used were not rated for 65 volts.{{sfn|Orloff & Harland|2006|p=374}}\n\nAt NAR's facility, Oxygen Tank&nbsp;2 had been originally installed in an oxygen shelf placed in the [[Apollo 10]] service module, SM-106, but which was removed to fix a potential [[electromagnetic interference]] problem and another shelf substituted. During removal, the shelf was accidentally dropped at least {{convert|2|in|cm|0|order=flip|sp=us}} because a retaining bolt had not been removed. The probability of damage from this was low, but it is possible that the fill line assembly was loose and made worse by the fall. After some retesting (which did not include filling the tank with liquid oxygen), in November 1968 the shelf was re-installed in SM-109, intended for Apollo&nbsp;13, which was shipped to KSC in June 1969.{{sfn|Accident report|pp=4-19, 4-21}}\n\nThe [[Terminal countdown demonstration test|Countdown Demonstration Test]] took place with SM-109 in its place near the top of the Saturn&nbsp;V and began on March 16, 1970.

After discussion among NASA and the contractors, attempts to empty the tank resumed on March 27. When it would not empty normally, the heaters in the tank were turned on to boil off the oxygen. The thermostatic switches were designed to prevent the heaters from raising the temperature higher than {{convert|80|F|C|order=flip}}, but they failed under the 65-volt power supply applied.
