It is the third entry in the ''Houkai'' series and [[spiritual successor]] to ''Houkai Gakuen'',<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.fangcun.gg.en.aisa&hl=en_US|title=Guns Girl - Honkai Gakuen - Apps on Google Play|website=play.google.com|language=en|access-date=2019-09-13}}</ref> using many characters from the previous title in a separate story. The game is notable for incorporating a variety of genres from [[hack and slash]] and [[Social simulation game|social simulation]] to elements of [[bullet hell]], [[Platform game|platforming]], [[shoot 'em up]] and [[dungeon crawl]]ing across multiple single and multiplayer modes.\n\nIn addition to the mobile game, the storyline of ''Honkai Impact 3rd'' spans multiple supplementary media including an anime series,<ref>{{Citation|title=Cooking with Valkyries|url=https://myanimelist.net/anime/40100/Cooking_with_Valkyries|access-date=2019-09-13}}</ref> multiple [[manhua]] series,<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://manga.honkaiimpact3.com/|title=Honkai Impact 3rd|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=9/12/2019}}</ref> and promotional videos.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==Gameplay==\n''Honkai Impact 3rd'' has players control a team of up to three characters, known as \"Valkyries\", in real-time combat against various enemies. During battle, players may freely move their character around the battlefield and switch between their three deployed Valkyries to adapt to various enemy types. Each Valkyrie has unique attack, evasion, switch, and ultimate skills, as well as a [[rock-paper-scissors]]-based character type to fulfill different team roles. Valkyrie stats and skills can be customized with various weapons and equipment, which can be improved by using in-game resources. New equipment (known as \"Stigmata\"), weapons, and Valkyries can obtained either through in-game crafting or through a [[Gacha game|gacha]] system.{{Citation needed|date=February 2020}}\n\nSingle-player game modes include the \"Story\" campaign, consisting of short stages punctuated by dialogue in [[cutscene]]s and [[full motion video]]s (FMVs), \"Chronicles\", a series of brief side stories that explore Valkyries' backstories, and \"Open World\", allowing exploration of a large open-ended field to gather materials and complete various challenge tasks, coupled with its own storyline. The game features various multiplayer cooperative and competitive modes such as \"Co-Op Raid\", where players team up to unlock legendary weapons; \"Memorial Arena\", where players compete against a set of bosses for the highest score; and \"Dirac Sea\", where players attempt to progress as far as possible through a gauntlet of battles to compete for high scores. Players are able to join groups of other players, called \"Armadas\", which allow for more opportunities for events and rewards. Armadas allow for limited requesting of materials and resources from other players in the Armada.\n\nOutside of battles, ''Honkai Impact 3rd'' allows players to interact with the Valkyrie and Stigmata characters through the \"Dorm\" mode. Upon completing character specific tasks, different characters may be able to move into the dorms, whereupon new character information and dialogues between those characters can be seen. Players can craft various pieces of furniture and design the layout of the dorm rooms to increase the \"comfort\" of the Valkyries and Stigmata therein. Greater comfort levels allow players to level up their dorm limits for more elaborate decoration. Players are able to visit and view each other's decorated dorm layouts.\n\nSecondary gameplay mechanics include various [[minigame]]s incorporating [[bullet hell]], [[Platform game|platforming]], and [[shoot 'em up]] elements that allow players to gather various crafting and experience materials. Limited-time seasonal events may also include gameplay styles such as [[Dungeon crawl|dungeon crawling]] and [[Battle royale game|battle royale]] which are not normally seen in the main gameplay modes.\n\n==Plot==\n\n=== Setting ===\n''Honkai Impact 3rd'' is set in an alternate version of Earth, plagued by catastrophes resulting from \"Honkai\" (roughly translates to \"the collapse\"). Honkai is largely viewed as a malevolent force with a will of its own, able to corrupt humans into undead creatures, manifest itself in the form of various monsters, and select various individuals known as \"Herrschers\" to imbue with god-like powers able to trigger apocalyptic events. The Honkai is a cyclic phenomenon, returning to end civilization on Earth each time it gets too advanced - the Previous Era ended 50,000 years prior to the game's start, after the 14th Herrscher defeated humanity.  \n\nIn the present day, various global factions exist to combat or take advantage of the power of Honkai. These include \"Schicksal\", a European-based peace keeping organization that deploys human warriors known as Valkyries to combat the Honkai; \"Anti-Entropy\", formerly the North American branch of Schicksal that objected to the use of human soldiers in favor of mechanized robots; and \"World Serpent\", a shadow organization manipulating events since the end of the Previous Era. \n\nPrior to the story's start, three Herrscher awakenings (or \"Impacts\") have occurred in the Current Era: the Herrscher of Reason who became the leader of Anti-Entropy instead of fighting humanity, the Herrscher of the Void who was sealed away by Schicksal under mysterious circumstances, and the Herrscher of Lightning who was prevented from fully awakening and sent to train her powers as a Valkyrie at Schicksal's St.Freya school.   \n\n=== Story ===\n{{plot|date=April 2020}}\nThe storyline of ''Honkai Impact 3rd'' spans multiple supplementary media including an anime series,<ref>{{Citation|title=Cooking with Valkyries|url=https://myanimelist.net/anime/40100/Cooking_with_Valkyries|access-date=2019-09-13}}</ref> multiple [[manhua]] series,<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://manga.honkaiimpact3.com/|title=Honkai Impact 3rd|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=9/12/2019}}</ref> and promotional videos.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe game's story starts with three Valkyries-in-training (Kiana Kaslana, Mei Raiden, and Bronya Zaychik) boarding the ''Selene'', a hostile flying battleship. The three take control of the battleship, then subdue Bronya when she is abruptly controlled malevolently. Following the successful mission, the girls take a graduation exam, during which a mysterious voice contacts Kiana and informs her of her lost parents, Siegfried Kaslana and Cecilia Schariac.\n\nThe Valkyries then dispatch to Schicksal's Oceania Branch to recover the Gem of Desire following a local Honkai Eruption that decimated the area. The trio discovers Wendy, who was implanted with the Gem of Desire, and learn that Wendy triggered the Honkai Eruption due to a hatred of Schicksal, which had crippled Wendy. Bronya is controlled again and attacks, causing Wendy to transform into a Herrscher. Although Mei and Kiana are able to subdue both girls, Anti-Entropy forces appear and Bronya kidnaps Wendy and Mei. The Valkyries subsequently track Anti-Entropy to the hijacked ME Corp with Bronya's assistance. There, Bronya destroys the biochip in her brain to free herself from Cocolia's control and enable the Valkyries to escape, but leaving Wendy behind.\n\nSearching for a way to revive Bronya, Theresa Apocalypse creates a virtual datascape to find data on the biochip. Kiana is transported to a recreation of Siberia during the year 2000 in the midst of the 2nd Honkai War. Kiana meets virtual recreations of her parents, Siegfried and Cecilia, and while Siegfried is badly injured, Kiana and Cecilia team up and successfully defeat a recreation of 2nd Herrscher, Sirin. Upon Sirin's defeat, it is revealed that the events that Kiana experienced were a hallucination created from Kiana's desires by Sirin. Fu Hua captures Kiana and takes her to Schicksal HQ.\n\nTheresa, Mei, and Himeko ally with Anti-Entropy forces and storm Schicksal HQ to save Kiana, breaching its defenses with the ''Selene'' and the ''Hyperion''. While the Valkyries are successful in infiltrating Schicksal HQ, Rita Rossweisse and Fu Hua captures Himeko and Tesla. Otto Apocalypse successfully reawakens Sirin using Kiana's body as a host. Sirin dispatches Mei, Theresa, and the Anti-Entropy forces and engages Fu Hua in combat, stealing the 3rd Herrscher's power in the process. Himeko and Tesla, with Fu Hua's help, obtain a vial of anti-Honkai serum and a prototype Battlesuit imbued with a Herrscher's power. Himeko dons the Battlesuit and engages Sirin, fighting her to a standstill. Einstein uses the ''Selene''<nowiki/>'s cannon on Sirin, forcing her to retreat into \"Imaginary Space\" with Himeko being pulled in as well. Himeko duels with Sirin in the Imaginary Space and injects the anti-Honkai serum into Sirin, causing her to revert to Kiana. Suffering massive losses, the remaining Valkyries and Anti-Entropy retreat, and the world is left devastated in the wake of Sirin's attack. Himeko and Kiana both go missing.\n\nFour months after Sirin's attack, Mei, Theresa, and Bronya attempt to meet with an intel dealer named Gray Serpent in Arc City who claims to have seen the Herrscher of the Void, unaware that Otto Apocalypse had dispatched Rita to obtain his information as well. Rita seems to kill Gray Serpent and steals his cybernetic implants, leading the Valkyries to capture a cyborg girl called the Ningyo. Before they can extract the Ningyo's information, Rita intercepts the Valkyries, steals the data, and formats the Ningyo's memory. While Einstein and Tesla attempt to retrieve the Ningyo's lost memories, the team is contacted by Cocolia, who convinces them to help find the Gem of Desire. Gray Serpent, seeking payment for the Valkyrie's theft of the Ningyo, hacks into the ''Selene''. When Bronya follows Gray Serpent into virtual space, he traps Bronya in a data labyrinth formed from her memories to deter her. Bronya is able to escape, though she witnesses a record of the 1st Herrscher, Welt Young, and Einstein battling the World Serpent, who is sealed within the Sea of Quanta.\n\nBronya, Theresa, and Einstein travel to The Deep, where Bronya is reunited with Cocolia and childhood friends Rosalia and Liliya. Cocolia informs the trio that the Gem of Desire was lost in the Sea of Quanta, and must be retrieved. While Einstein prepares to enter the Eye of the Deep, a portal leading to the Sea of Quanta, Bronya attempts to reconcile with Cocolia. When Einstein discovers Cocolia scheming with Gray Serpent, Gray Serpent attacks Einstein and she vanishes. A swarm of Honkai emerges from the Eye of the Deep and attacks, leading Bronya to dive into the Sea of Quanta alone. In the Sea, Bronya is greeted by Joachim, a fragment of Welt Young. Joachim sends Bronya to multiple pocket universes as a test, during which Bronya is reunited with Seele Vollerei (Bronya's childhood friend who became stuck in quantum state following a failed X-10 Project years ago). In efforts to guide Seele out of the quanta, they resolve to escape together.\n\nAfter clearing some honkai beasts and being separated, Seele and Bronya reunite and try to escape the labyrinth.The two girls reach the edge of the Quanta but are caught by tentacles. Bronya makes a sacrifice and cuts the tentacles binding Seele, succumbing to the tentacles herself. However, Seele dislikes her powerlessness and the Dark Seele finally agreesto lend her power to Seele, and they use their combined power to rescue Bronya.\n\nBack to Kiana; after recapturing control of her body, she has been living in exile alone in the Arc City in order not to hurt others with the Herrscher personality. One night, she is fighting with Honkai beasts when Sirin seeks the opportunity to torment and brainwash Kiana, attempting to reawake the Herrscher. Fortunately, Fu Hua reaches Kiana's mind and drive Sirin away. Kiana holds hatred towards Fu Hua at first, but Fu Hua tells Kiana that their spirits are combined forever due to the power of Key of Deity, and that Kiana must learn to control the Herrscher power by herself. Under Fu Hua's training, Kiana finally succeeds, and returns to fighting against Honkai in Arc City.\n\n==Development==\nThe production team for ''Honkai Impact 3rd'' grew from a 7-person start to employing over 200 employees in 2018.<ref name=\":02\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.bilibili.com/read/cv1141716/|title=\u5d29\u574f3\u4e0a\u7ebf\u4e24\u5e74 \u8001\u73a9\u5bb6\u4eec\u7684\u8bc4\u4ef7\u96c6\u9526|last=\u6bcf\u65e5\u6e38\u620f\u83cc|website=www.bilibili.com|access-date=2020-03-31}}</ref> [[Mihoyo]] offers small amounts of in-game currency to users that fill out surveys about their experience in the game, allowing the game's [[Developer (software)|developers]] to adjust future events and tweak the game.

Armadas allow for limited requesting of materials and resources from other players in the Armada.\n\nOutside of battles, ''Honkai Impact 3rd'' allows players to interact with the Valkyrie and Stigmata characters through the \"Dorm\" mode. Upon completing character specific tasks, different characters may be able to move into the dorms, whereupon new character information and dialogues between those characters can be seen. Players can craft various pieces of furniture and design the layout of the dorm rooms to increase the \"comfort\" of the Valkyries and Stigmata therein. Greater comfort levels allow players to level up their dorm limits for more elaborate decoration. Players are able to visit and view each other's decorated dorm layouts.\n\nSecondary gameplay mechanics include various [[minigame]]s incorporating [[bullet hell]], [[Platform game|platforming]], and [[shoot 'em up]] elements that allow players to gather various crafting and experience materials. Limited-time seasonal events may also include gameplay styles such as [[Dungeon crawl|dungeon crawling]] and [[Battle royale game|battle royale]] which are not normally seen in the main gameplay modes.\n\n==Plot==\n\n=== Setting ===\n''Honkai Impact 3rd'' is set in an alternate version of Earth, plagued by catastrophes resulting from \"Honkai\" (roughly translates to \"the collapse\"). Honkai is largely viewed as a malevolent force with a will of its own, able to corrupt humans into undead creatures, manifest itself in the form of various monsters, and select various individuals known as \"Herrschers\" to imbue with god-like powers able to trigger apocalyptic events. The Honkai is a cyclic phenomenon, returning to end civilization on Earth each time it gets too advanced - the Previous Era ended 50,000 years prior to the game's start, after the 14th Herrscher defeated humanity.  \n\nIn the present day, various global factions exist to combat or take advantage of the power of Honkai. These include \"Schicksal\", a European-based peace keeping organization that deploys human warriors known as Valkyries to combat the Honkai; \"Anti-Entropy\", formerly the North American branch of Schicksal that objected to the use of human soldiers in favor of mechanized robots; and \"World Serpent\", a shadow organization manipulating events since the end of the Previous Era. \n\nPrior to the story's start, three Herrscher awakenings (or \"Impacts\") have occurred in the Current Era: the Herrscher of Reason who became the leader of Anti-Entropy instead of fighting humanity, the Herrscher of the Void who was sealed away by Schicksal under mysterious circumstances, and the Herrscher of Lightning who was prevented from fully awakening and sent to train her powers as a Valkyrie at Schicksal's St.Freya school.   \n\n=== Story ===\n{{plot|date=April 2020}}\nThe storyline of ''Honkai Impact 3rd'' spans multiple supplementary media including an anime series,<ref>{{Citation|title=Cooking with Valkyries|url=https://myanimelist.net/anime/40100/Cooking_with_Valkyries|access-date=2019-09-13}}</ref> multiple [[manhua]] series,<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://manga.honkaiimpact3.com/|title=Honkai Impact 3rd|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=9/12/2019}}</ref> and promotional videos.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe game's story starts with three Valkyries-in-training (Kiana Kaslana, Mei Raiden, and Bronya Zaychik) boarding the ''Selene'', a hostile flying battleship. The three take control of the battleship, then subdue Bronya when she is abruptly controlled malevolently. Following the successful mission, the girls take a graduation exam, during which a mysterious voice contacts Kiana and informs her of her lost parents, Siegfried Kaslana and Cecilia Schariac.\n\nThe Valkyries then dispatch to Schicksal's Oceania Branch to recover the Gem of Desire following a local Honkai Eruption that decimated the area. The trio discovers Wendy, who was implanted with the Gem of Desire, and learn that Wendy triggered the Honkai Eruption due to a hatred of Schicksal, which had crippled Wendy. Bronya is controlled again and attacks, causing Wendy to transform into a Herrscher. Although Mei and Kiana are able to subdue both girls, Anti-Entropy forces appear and Bronya kidnaps Wendy and Mei. The Valkyries subsequently track Anti-Entropy to the hijacked ME Corp with Bronya's assistance. There, Bronya destroys the biochip in her brain to free herself from Cocolia's control and enable the Valkyries to escape, but leaving Wendy behind.\n\nSearching for a way to revive Bronya, Theresa Apocalypse creates a virtual datascape to find data on the biochip. Kiana is transported to a recreation of Siberia during the year 2000 in the midst of the 2nd Honkai War. Kiana meets virtual recreations of her parents, Siegfried and Cecilia, and while Siegfried is badly injured, Kiana and Cecilia team up and successfully defeat a recreation of 2nd Herrscher, Sirin. Upon Sirin's defeat, it is revealed that the events that Kiana experienced were a hallucination created from Kiana's desires by Sirin. Fu Hua captures Kiana and takes her to Schicksal HQ.\n\nTheresa, Mei, and Himeko ally with Anti-Entropy forces and storm Schicksal HQ to save Kiana, breaching its defenses with the ''Selene'' and the ''Hyperion''. While the Valkyries are successful in infiltrating Schicksal HQ, Rita Rossweisse and Fu Hua captures Himeko and Tesla. Otto Apocalypse successfully reawakens Sirin using Kiana's body as a host. Sirin dispatches Mei, Theresa, and the Anti-Entropy forces and engages Fu Hua in combat, stealing the 3rd Herrscher's power in the process. Himeko and Tesla, with Fu Hua's help, obtain a vial of anti-Honkai serum and a prototype Battlesuit imbued with a Herrscher's power. Himeko dons the Battlesuit and engages Sirin, fighting her to a standstill. Einstein uses the ''Selene''<nowiki/>'s cannon on Sirin, forcing her to retreat into \"Imaginary Space\" with Himeko being pulled in as well. Himeko duels with Sirin in the Imaginary Space and injects the anti-Honkai serum into Sirin, causing her to revert to Kiana. Suffering massive losses, the remaining Valkyries and Anti-Entropy retreat, and the world is left devastated in the wake of Sirin's attack. Himeko and Kiana both go missing.\n\nFour months after Sirin's attack, Mei, Theresa, and Bronya attempt to meet with an intel dealer named Gray Serpent in Arc City who claims to have seen the Herrscher of the Void, unaware that Otto Apocalypse had dispatched Rita to obtain his information as well. Rita seems to kill Gray Serpent and steals his cybernetic implants, leading the Valkyries to capture a cyborg girl called the Ningyo. Before they can extract the Ningyo's information, Rita intercepts the Valkyries, steals the data, and formats the Ningyo's memory. While Einstein and Tesla attempt to retrieve the Ningyo's lost memories, the team is contacted by Cocolia, who convinces them to help find the Gem of Desire. Gray Serpent, seeking payment for the Valkyrie's theft of the Ningyo, hacks into the ''Selene''. When Bronya follows Gray Serpent into virtual space, he traps Bronya in a data labyrinth formed from her memories to deter her. Bronya is able to escape, though she witnesses a record of the 1st Herrscher, Welt Young, and Einstein battling the World Serpent, who is sealed within the Sea of Quanta.\n\nBronya, Theresa, and Einstein travel to The Deep, where Bronya is reunited with Cocolia and childhood friends Rosalia and Liliya. Cocolia informs the trio that the Gem of Desire was lost in the Sea of Quanta, and must be retrieved. While Einstein prepares to enter the Eye of the Deep, a portal leading to the Sea of Quanta, Bronya attempts to reconcile with Cocolia. When Einstein discovers Cocolia scheming with Gray Serpent, Gray Serpent attacks Einstein and she vanishes. A swarm of Honkai emerges from the Eye of the Deep and attacks, leading Bronya to dive into the Sea of Quanta alone. In the Sea, Bronya is greeted by Joachim, a fragment of Welt Young. Joachim sends Bronya to multiple pocket universes as a test, during which Bronya is reunited with Seele Vollerei (Bronya's childhood friend who became stuck in quantum state following a failed X-10 Project years ago). In efforts to guide Seele out of the quanta, they resolve to escape together.\n\nAfter clearing some honkai beasts and being separated, Seele and Bronya reunite and try to escape the labyrinth.The two girls reach the edge of the Quanta but are caught by tentacles. Bronya makes a sacrifice and cuts the tentacles binding Seele, succumbing to the tentacles herself. However, Seele dislikes her powerlessness and the Dark Seele finally agreesto lend her power to Seele, and they use their combined power to rescue Bronya.\n\nBack to Kiana; after recapturing control of her body, she has been living in exile alone in the Arc City in order not to hurt others with the Herrscher personality. One night, she is fighting with Honkai beasts when Sirin seeks the opportunity to torment and brainwash Kiana, attempting to reawake the Herrscher. Fortunately, Fu Hua reaches Kiana's mind and drive Sirin away. Kiana holds hatred towards Fu Hua at first, but Fu Hua tells Kiana that their spirits are combined forever due to the power of Key of Deity, and that Kiana must learn to control the Herrscher power by herself. Under Fu Hua's training, Kiana finally succeeds, and returns to fighting against Honkai in Arc City.\n\n==Development==\nThe production team for ''Honkai Impact 3rd'' grew from a 7-person start to employing over 200 employees in 2018.<ref name=\":02\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.bilibili.com/read/cv1141716/|title=\u5d29\u574f3\u4e0a\u7ebf\u4e24\u5e74 \u8001\u73a9\u5bb6\u4eec\u7684\u8bc4\u4ef7\u96c6\u9526|last=\u6bcf\u65e5\u6e38\u620f\u83cc|website=www.bilibili.com|access-date=2020-03-31}}</ref> [[Mihoyo]] offers small amounts of in-game currency to users that fill out surveys about their experience in the game, allowing the game's [[Developer (software)|developers]] to adjust future events and tweak the game.

When MCAS detects that the aircraft is operating in manual flight, with flaps up, at an elevated angle of attack (AoA), it adjusts the horizontal stabilizer trim to add positive force feedback (a \"nose heavy\" feel), through the control column, so the pilot will not inadvertently pull the airplane up too steeply, potentially causing a [[Stall (fluid dynamics)|stall]]. Contrary to descriptions in news reports, however, Boeing claims that MCAS is not an anti-stall system. Stabilizer movement commanded by MCAS pushes down the nose of the airplane automatically without pilot input.\n\nMCAS on the MAX was designed to activate using input from only one of the airplane's two angle of attack sensors, making the system susceptible to a [[single point of failure]].

A runaway stabilizer has continuous un-commanded movement of the tail, whereas MCAS is not continuous and pilots (theoretically) can counter the nose-down movement, after which MCAS would move the aircraft tail down again. Moreover, unlike runaway stabilizer, MCAS disables the control column response that 737 pilots have grown accustomed to and relied upon in earlier generations of 737 aircraft.</blockquote>\n\nIn May 2019, ''[[The Seattle Times]]'' reported that the two stabilizer cutoff switches on the MAX operate differently than on the earlier 737 NG. On previous aircraft, one cutoff switch deactivates the thumb buttons on the control yoke that pilots use to move the horizontal stabilizer; the other cutoff switch disables automatic control (as from autopilot) to move the stabilizer in the tail. On the MAX, both switches do the same thing: they cut off all electric power to the stabilizer, both from the yoke buttons and from an automatic system, like MCAS. With all power to the stabilizer cut, pilots have no choice but to use the mechanical trim wheel in the center console.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.seattletimes.com/business/boeing-aerospace/boeing-altered-key-switches-in-737-max-cockpit-limiting-ability-to-shut-off-mcas/|title=Boeing altered key switches in 737 MAX cockpit, limiting ability to shut off MCAS|date=2019-05-10|website=[[The Seattle Times]]|access-date=2019-10-15}}</ref> However, as pilots pull on the 737 controls to raise the nose of the aircraft, aerodynamic forces on the elevator create an opposing force, effectively paralyzing the jackscrew mechanism.<ref\n      name=\"jscrew\">{{Cite web\n | url=              https://theaircurrent.com/aviation-safety/vestigal-design-issue-clouds-737-max-crash-investigations/|title=Vestigal design issue clouds 737 MAX crash investigations\n | date=            2019-04-04\n    }}</ref>> It becomes very difficult for pilots to hand crank the trim wheel.<ref\n  name=\"jscrew\"/> The problem was encountered on earlier 737 versions, and a \"roller coaster\" emergency technique for handling the flight condition was documented in 1982 for the 737-200 but did not appear in training documentation for later versions (including the MAX).<ref\n  name=\"jscrew\"/>\n\nDuring the groundings, special flights to reposition MAX aircraft to storage locations, as per 14 CFR \u00a7 21.197, flew at lower [[flight level|altitude]] and with [[Flap (aeronautics)|flaps]] extended to circumvent MCAS activation, rather than using the recovery procedure after the fact.

The trim is actuated via a [[jackscrew]] mechanism.\n\n====Slippage concern====\nSylvain Alarie and Gilles Primeau, experts on the horizontal stabilizers, observed anomalies in the data from the aircraft data recorders: a progressive shift of 0.2 degrees of the horizontal stabilizer, before the crash. \"It may not seem like much, but it is an order of magnitude higher than what is normally allowed when designing systems like these\", says Gilles Primeau. They say that the movements are easily observable, and disallowed according to Regulation 395A. These anomalies raise fundamental questions about this jack screw, which controls the horizontal stabilizer since the beginning of the 737 models, first certified in 1967.<ref name=\":19\">{{Cite web|url=https://ici.radio-canada.ca/nouvelle/1382157/boeing-737-max-experts-questions-enquete-verin-systeme-anomalie-aeronautique|title=Des r\u00e9v\u00e9lations troublantes sur le Boeing 737 MAX 8|last=ICI.Radio-Canada.ca|first=Zone \u00c9conomie-|website=Radio-Canada.ca|language=fr-ca|access-date=2019-11-11}}</ref>\n\nThese slips are particularly visible on flight ET302: \"While there is no MCAS command, and no control of the pilots, we see a movement of the jack screw which controls the horizontal stabilizer, we see a slip.

When the elevator operated to raise or lower the nose, it set up a strong force on the trim jackscrew which opposed any corrective force from the control systems. When attempting to correct an unwanted deflection using the manual trim wheel, exerting enough hand force to overcome the force exerted by the elevator became increasingly difficult as speed and deflection increased and the jack screw effectively jammed in place.<ref name=\"ostrower\">Jon Ostrower; \"[https://theaircurrent.com/aviation-safety/vestigal-design-issue-clouds-737-max-crash-investigations/ Vestigial design issue clouds 737 Max crash investigations]\", ''The Air Current'', April 4, 2019. (retrieved November 21, 2019)</ref>\n\nA workaround was developed called the \"roller coaster\" technique. Counter-intuitively, to correct an excessive deflection causing a dive the pilot first pushes the nose down further, before easing back to gently raise the nose again. During this easing back period, the elevator deflection reduces or even reverses, its force on the jackscrew does likewise and the manual trim eases up. The workaround was included in the pilot's emergency procedures and in the training schedule.<ref name=\"ostrower\"/>\n\nHowever while the 737 Max has a similar jackscrew mechanism the \"roller coaster\" technique has been dropped from the pilot information. During the events leading to the two Max crashes, the stiffness of the manual trim wheel repeatedly prevented manual trim adjustment to correct the MCAS-induced nose-down pitching. The issue has been brought to the notice of the DoJ criminal inquiry into the 737 Max crashes.<ref name=\"ostrower\"/>\n\nIn simulator tests of [[Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302]] flight scenario, the trim wheel was \"impossible\" to move when one of the pilots would instinctively pull up from the nosedives. It takes 15 turns to manually trim the aircraft one degree, and up to 40 turns to bring the trim back to neutral from the nose down position caused by MCAS.<ref>{{Cite news |url= https://www.flightglobal.com/safety/simulator-tests-demonstrate-737-max-manual-trim-difficulties/137651.article |title= Simulator tests demonstrate 737 Max manual trim difficulties |last= Hemmerdinger |first= Jon |website= FlightGlobal |date= 2020-04-02}}</ref>\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* {{cite video |url= https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QytfYyHmxtc |title= Rogue Boeing 737 Max planes \u2018with minds of their own\u2019 |author= 60 Minutes Australia |date= May 5, 2019 |via= YouTube |quote= MCAS was designed using data from only one of the sensors because we knew the FAA would not have certified a two sensor system without level D [simulator] training}}\n* {{cite video |url= https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2tuKiiznsY|title=The real reason Boeing's new plane crashed twice |author= [[Vox (website)#Video|Vox Videos]] |date= Apr 15, 2019|via= Youtube}}\n* {{Cite video |author= Mentour Pilot|title=Boeing 737 Unable to Trim!!

When MCAS detects that the aircraft is operating in manual flight, with flaps up, at an elevated angle of attack (AoA), it adjusts the horizontal stabilizer trim to add positive force feedback (a \"nose heavy\" feel), through the control column, so the pilot will not inadvertently pull the airplane up too steeply, potentially causing a [[Stall (fluid dynamics)|stall]]. Contrary to descriptions in news reports, however, Boeing claims that MCAS is not an anti-stall system. Stabilizer movement commanded by MCAS pushes down the nose of the airplane automatically without pilot input.\n\nMCAS on the MAX was designed to activate using input from only one of the airplane's two angle of attack sensors, making the system susceptible to a [[single point of failure]].

A runaway stabilizer has continuous un-commanded movement of the tail, whereas MCAS is not continuous and pilots (theoretically) can counter the nose-down movement, after which MCAS would move the aircraft tail down again. Moreover, unlike runaway stabilizer, MCAS disables the control column response that 737 pilots have grown accustomed to and relied upon in earlier generations of 737 aircraft.</blockquote>\n\nIn May 2019, ''[[The Seattle Times]]'' reported that the two stabilizer cutoff switches on the MAX operate differently than on the earlier 737 NG. On previous aircraft, one cutoff switch deactivates the thumb buttons on the control yoke that pilots use to move the horizontal stabilizer; the other cutoff switch disables automatic control (as from autopilot) to move the stabilizer in the tail. On the MAX, both switches do the same thing: they cut off all electric power to the stabilizer, both from the yoke buttons and from an automatic system, like MCAS. With all power to the stabilizer cut, pilots have no choice but to use the mechanical trim wheel in the center console.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.seattletimes.com/business/boeing-aerospace/boeing-altered-key-switches-in-737-max-cockpit-limiting-ability-to-shut-off-mcas/|title=Boeing altered key switches in 737 MAX cockpit, limiting ability to shut off MCAS|date=2019-05-10|website=[[The Seattle Times]]|access-date=2019-10-15}}</ref> However, as pilots pull on the 737 controls to raise the nose of the aircraft, aerodynamic forces on the elevator create an opposing force, effectively paralyzing the jackscrew mechanism.<ref\n      name=\"jscrew\">{{Cite web\n | url=              https://theaircurrent.com/aviation-safety/vestigal-design-issue-clouds-737-max-crash-investigations/|title=Vestigal design issue clouds 737 MAX crash investigations\n | date=            2019-04-04\n    }}</ref>> It becomes very difficult for pilots to hand crank the trim wheel.<ref\n  name=\"jscrew\"/> The problem was encountered on earlier 737 versions, and a \"roller coaster\" emergency technique for handling the flight condition was documented in 1982 for the 737-200 but did not appear in training documentation for later versions (including the MAX).<ref\n  name=\"jscrew\"/>\n\nDuring the groundings, special flights to reposition MAX aircraft to storage locations, as per 14 CFR \u00a7 21.197, flew at lower [[flight level|altitude]] and with [[Flap (aeronautics)|flaps]] extended to circumvent MCAS activation, rather than using the recovery procedure after the fact.

They say that the movements are easily observable, and disallowed according to Regulation 395A. These anomalies raise fundamental questions about this jack screw, which controls the horizontal stabilizer since the beginning of the 737 models, first certified in 1967.<ref name=\":19\">{{Cite web|url=https://ici.radio-canada.ca/nouvelle/1382157/boeing-737-max-experts-questions-enquete-verin-systeme-anomalie-aeronautique|title=Des r\u00e9v\u00e9lations troublantes sur le Boeing 737 MAX 8|last=ICI.Radio-Canada.ca|first=Zone \u00c9conomie-|website=Radio-Canada.ca|language=fr-ca|access-date=2019-11-11}}</ref>\n\nThese slips are particularly visible on flight ET302: \"While there is no MCAS command, and no control of the pilots, we see a movement of the jack screw which controls the horizontal stabilizer, we see a slip.

When the elevator operated to raise or lower the nose, it set up a strong force on the trim jackscrew which opposed any corrective force from the control systems. When attempting to correct an unwanted deflection using the manual trim wheel, exerting enough hand force to overcome the force exerted by the elevator became increasingly difficult as speed and deflection increased and the jack screw effectively jammed in place.<ref name=\"ostrower\">Jon Ostrower; \"[https://theaircurrent.com/aviation-safety/vestigal-design-issue-clouds-737-max-crash-investigations/ Vestigial design issue clouds 737 Max crash investigations]\", ''The Air Current'', April 4, 2019. (retrieved November 21, 2019)</ref>\n\nA workaround was developed called the \"roller coaster\" technique. Counter-intuitively, to correct an excessive deflection causing a dive the pilot first pushes the nose down further, before easing back to gently raise the nose again. During this easing back period, the elevator deflection reduces or even reverses, its force on the jackscrew does likewise and the manual trim eases up. The workaround was included in the pilot's emergency procedures and in the training schedule.<ref name=\"ostrower\"/>\n\nHowever while the 737 Max has a similar jackscrew mechanism the \"roller coaster\" technique has been dropped from the pilot information. During the events leading to the two Max crashes, the stiffness of the manual trim wheel repeatedly prevented manual trim adjustment to correct the MCAS-induced nose-down pitching.

Cochineal appears to have been brought to Europe during the conquest of [[Mexico]] by the Spaniard [[Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s]], and the name 'carmine' is derived from the French ''carmin''. It was first described by [[Pietro Andrea Mattioli]] in 1549. The pigment is also called ''cochineal'' after the insect from which it is made.\n\n'''[[Alizarin]]''' (PR83) is a pigment that was  first synthesized in  1868 by the German [[chemist]]s [[Carl Gr\u00e4be]] and [[Carl Liebermann]] and replaced the natural pigment [[madder lake]]. Alizarin crimson is a dye bonded onto [[alum]] which is then used as a pigment and mixed with [[ochre]], [[sienna]] and [[umber]]. It is not totally colorfast.\n\n== Etymology ==\n\nThe word ''crimson'' has been recorded in English since 1400,<ref>The first recorded use of ''crimson'' as a color name in English was in 1400 according to the following book: Maerz and Paul ''A Dictionary of Color'' New York:1930--McGraw Hill Page 193; Color Sample of Crimson: Page 31 Plate 4 Color Sample K6</ref> and its earlier forms include ''cremesin'', ''crymysyn'' and ''cramoysin'' (cf. cramoisy, a crimson cloth). These were adapted via [[Old Spanish]] from the [[Medieval Latin]] ''cremesinus'' (also ''kermesinus'' or ''carmesinus''), the dye produced from ''[[Kermes (genus)|Kermes]]'' scale insects, and can be traced back to Arabic ''qermez'' (\"red\"), also borrowed in [[Turkish language|Turkish]] ''k\u0131rm\u0131z\u0131'' and many other languages, e.g. German ''Karmesin'', Italian ''cremisi'', French ''cramoisi'', Portuguese ''carmesim'', Dutch \u201ckarmozijn\u201d, etc. (via Latin). The ultimate source may be Sanskrit \u0915\u0943\u092e\u093f\u091c ''k\u1e5bmi-j\u0101'' meaning \"worm-made\".<ref>\"American Heritage Dictionary\", s.v. ''Kermes''; also [[Friedrich Kluge|Kluge]], \"Etymologisches W\u00f6rterbuch der deutschen Sprache\", s.v. ''Karmesin'', et al.</ref>\n\nA shortened form of ''carmesinus'' also gave the Latin ''carminus'', from which comes [[carmine]].\n\nOther cognates include the Persian ''qermez'' (or ''ghermez'') \"red\", [[Old Church Slavonic]] ''\u010druminu'', archaic [[Russian language|Russian]] \u0447\u0435\u0440\u043c\u043d\u044b\u0439 (''\u010dermnyj''), and [[Serbo-Croatian]] ''crven'' \"red\". Cf. also [[vermilion]].\n\n== Dyes ==\n{{Main article|Carmine|Kermes (dye)}}\n[[File:Carminic acid structure.png|thumb|right|Carminic acid]]\n\nCarmine [[natural dye|dyes]], which give crimson and related red and purple colors, are based on an [[aluminium]] and [[calcium]] [[salt]] of [[carminic acid]]. '''Carmine lake''' is an aluminium or aluminium-tin [[lake pigment|lake]] of cochineal extract, and '''crimson lake''' is prepared by striking down an infusion of cochineal with a 5 [[percent]] [[solution]] of [[alum]] and [[Potassium tartrate|cream of tartar]]. '''Purple lake''' is prepared like carmine lake with the addition of [[calcium oxide|lime]] to produce the deep purple tone. Carmine dyes tend to fade quickly.\n\nCarmine dyes were once widely prized in both the Americas and in Europe. They were used in paints by [[Michelangelo]] and for the crimson fabrics of the [[Hussars]], the [[Turkic peoples|Turks]], the [[Red coat (British army)|British Redcoats]], and the [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police]].\n\nNowadays carmine dyes are used for coloring foodstuffs, medicines and cosmetics. As a [[food additive]] in the European Union, carmine dyes are designated [[Carmine|E120]], and are also called '''cochineal''' and '''Natural Red 4'''. Carmine dyes are also used in some [[oil paint]]s and [[watercolor]]s used by artists.\n\n==In nature==\n\n===Algae===\n* The [[Red tide|crimson tide]] which sometimes occurs on beaches is caused by a type of algae known as ''[[Karenia brevis]]''.\n\n===Birds===\n*[[Crimson rosella|Crimson rosellas]] are a subspecies of [[parrot]] that are common in [[Australia]].[[File:Crimson Rosella dec07.jpg|alt=Crimson rosella|thumb|[[Crimson rosella]]]]\n*The [[crimson sunbird]] is the national bird of [[Singapore]].[[File:Crimson sunbird 3.jpg|alt=Crimson sunbird|thumb|[[Crimson sunbird]]]]\n\n==In culture==\n\n=== Literature ===\n* In [[George R.R.

They fell out of use with the introduction of [[cochineal]], because although the dyes were comparable in quality and color intensity, it needed ten to twelve times as much kermes to produce the same effect as cochineal.\n\n'''[[Carmine]]''' is the name given to the dye made from the dried bodies of the female cochineal, although the name '''crimson''' is sometimes applied to these dyes too.

'''Carmine lake''' is an aluminium or aluminium-tin [[lake pigment|lake]] of cochineal extract, and '''crimson lake''' is prepared by striking down an infusion of cochineal with a 5 [[percent]] [[solution]] of [[alum]] and [[Potassium tartrate|cream of tartar]]. '''Purple lake''' is prepared like carmine lake with the addition of [[calcium oxide|lime]] to produce the deep purple tone. Carmine dyes tend to fade quickly.\n\nCarmine dyes were once widely prized in both the Americas and in Europe. They were used in paints by [[Michelangelo]] and for the crimson fabrics of the [[Hussars]], the [[Turkic peoples|Turks]], the [[Red coat (British army)|British Redcoats]], and the [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police]].\n\nNowadays carmine dyes are used for coloring foodstuffs, medicines and cosmetics. As a [[food additive]] in the European Union, carmine dyes are designated [[Carmine|E120]], and are also called '''cochineal''' and '''Natural Red 4'''.

These measures were enacted by the former [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] states at the turn of the 20th century, and by [[Oklahoma]] when it gained statehood in 1907,<ref name=\"Kentucky\"/> although ''not'' by the former [[border states (American Civil War)|border slave states]]. Their actions were designed to thwart the objective of the [[Fifteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifteenth Amendment]] to the [[United States Constitution]], [[ratified]] in 1870, which sought to protect the [[Voting rights in the United States|suffrage]] of [[freedmen]] after the [[American Civil War]].\n\nDuring the later elections of [[Reconstruction Era|Reconstruction]] era, beginning in the 1870s, [[White people|white]] [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]] used violence by [[paramilitary]] groups, as well as fraud, to suppress black [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] voters and turn Republicans out of office.  After regaining control of the state legislatures, Democrats were alarmed by a late 19th-century alliance between Republicans and Populists that cost them some elections. After achieving control of state legislatures, white Democrats added to previous efforts and achieved widespread disenfranchisement by law: from 1890 to 1908, Southern state legislatures passed new constitutions, constitutional amendments, and laws that made voter registration and voting more difficult, especially when administered by white staff in a discriminatory way. They succeeded in disenfranchising most of the black citizens, as well as many [[Poor White|poor whites]] in the South, and voter rolls dropped dramatically in each state. The Republican Party was nearly eliminated in the region for decades, and the Democrats established one-party control throughout the southern states.<ref>Valelly, Richard M.; ''The Two Reconstructions: The Struggle for Black Enfranchisement'' University of Chicago Press, 2009, pp. 134-139 {{ISBN|9780226845302}}</ref>\n\nIn 1912, the Republican Party was split when Roosevelt ran against the party regular, Taft. In the South by this time, the Republican Party had been hollowed out by the disenfranchisement of African Americans, who were largely excluded from voting. Democrat [[Woodrow Wilson]] was elected as the first southern [[President of the United States|President]] since 1856. He was re-elected in 1916, in a much closer presidential contest. During his first term, Wilson satisfied the request of Southerners in his cabinet and instituted overt [[Racial segregation in the United States|racial segregation]] throughout federal government workplaces, as well as [[racial discrimination]] in hiring.<ref name=\"Teachingamericanhistory.org\">{{cite web |url=http://teachingamericanhistory.org/library/index.asp?documentprint=1115 |title=Another Open Letter to Woodrow Wilson W.E.B.

In addition, because black Southerners were not listed on local voter rolls, they were automatically excluded from [[jury duty|serving in local courts]]. Juries were [[all-white jury|all white]] across the South.\n\nPolitical disenfranchisement did not end until after passage of the [[Voting Rights Act of 1965]], which authorized the federal government to monitor voter registration practices and elections where populations were historically underrepresented, and to enforce constitutional voting rights. The challenge to voting rights has continued into the 21st century, as shown by numerous court cases in 2016 alone, though attempts to restrict voting rights for political advantage have not been confined to the Southern states. Another method of seeking political advantage through the voting system is the [[Gerrymandering in the United States|gerrymandering of electoral boundaries]], as was the case of North Carolina, which in January 2018 was declared by a federal court to be unconstitutional.<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/09/us/north-carolina-gerrymander.html North Carolina Is Ordered to Redraw Its Congressional Map]</ref> Such cases are expected to reach the Supreme Court.<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/11/us/gerrymander-court-north-carolina-pennsylvania.html Is Partisan Gerrymandering Legal?

Congress passed the [[Reconstruction Acts]], starting in 1867, establishing military districts to oversee the affairs of these states pending reconstruction.\n\nDuring the Reconstruction era, blacks constituted absolute majorities of the populations in [[Mississippi]] and [[South Carolina]], were equal to the white population in Louisiana, and represented more than 40 percent of the population in four other former Confederate states. Southern whites, fearing black domination, resisted the [[freedmen]]'s exercise of political power.<ref>Gabriel J. Chin & Randy Wagner, \"The Tyranny of the Minority: Jim Crow and the Counter-Majoritarian Difficulty,\" [http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=963036&high=%20Gabriel%20CHin 43 ''Harvard Civil Rights-Civil Liberties Law Review'' 65 (2008)]</ref> In 1867, black men voted for the first time. By the [[1868 United States presidential election|1868 presidential election]], Texas, Mississippi, and Virginia had still not been re-admitted to the Union. General [[Ulysses S. Grant]] was elected as president thanks in part to 700,000 black voters. In February 1870, the Fifteenth Amendment was ratified; it was designed to protect blacks' right to vote from infringement by the states.\n\nWhite supremacist [[paramilitary]] organizations, allied with Southern Democrats, used intimidation, violence and even committed assassinations in order to repress blacks and prevent them from exercising their [[civil and political rights]] in elections from 1868 until the mid-1870s. The insurgent [[Ku Klux Klan]] (KKK) was formed in 1865 in [[Tennessee]] (as a backlash to defeat in the war) and it quickly became a powerful secret [[vigilante]] group, with chapters across the South. The Klan initiated a campaign of intimidation directed against blacks and sympathetic whites. Their violence included [[vandalism]] and destruction of property, physical attacks and assassinations, and [[lynching]]s. Teachers who came from the North to teach freedmen were sometimes attacked or intimidated as well.\n\nThe toll of Klan murders and attacks led [[United States Congress|Congress]] to pass laws to end the violence. In 1870, the strongly [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] Congress passed the [[Enforcement Acts]], imposing penalties for conspiracy to deny black suffrage.<ref name=\"Andrews\">{{cite book\n  | last =Andrews\n  | first =E. Benjamin\n  | authorlink =Elisha Benjamin Andrews\n  | title =History of the United States\n  | publisher =Charles Scribner's Sons\n  | year =1912\n  | location =New York }}</ref> The Acts empowered the President to deploy the armed forces to suppress organizations that deprived people of rights guaranteed by the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]]. Organizations whose members appeared in arms were considered in rebellion against the United States. The President could suspend ''[[habeas corpus]]'' under those circumstances. President Grant used these provisions in parts of the [[Carolinas]] in late 1871. United States marshals supervised state voter registrations and elections and could summon the help of military or naval forces if needed.<ref name=\"Andrews\" /> These measures led to the demise of the first Klan by the early 1870s.\n\nNew paramilitary groups quickly sprang up, as tens of thousands of veterans belonged to gun clubs and similar groups. A second wave of violence began, resulting in over 1,000 deaths, usually black or Republican. The [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] ruled in 1876 in ''[[United States v. Cruikshank]]'', arising from trials related to the [[Colfax Massacre]], that protections of the Fourteenth Amendment, which the Enforcement Acts were intended to support, did not apply to the actions of individuals, but only to the actions of state governments. They recommended that persons seek relief from state courts, which had not been supportive of freedmen's rights.\n\nThe [[paramilitary]] organizations that arose in the mid to late 1870s were part of continuing [[insurgency]] in the South after the Civil War, as armed veterans in the South resisted social changes, and worked to prevent black Americans and other Republicans from voting and running for office. Such groups included the [[White League]], formed in Louisiana in 1874 from white [[militias]], with chapters forming in other Southern states; the [[Red Shirts (Southern United States)|Red Shirts]], formed in 1875 in Mississippi but also active in [[North Carolina]] and South Carolina; and other \"White Liners,\" such as [[rifle clubs]] and the [[Knights of the White Camellia]]. Compared to the Klan, they were open societies, better organized and devoted to the political goal of regaining control of the state legislatures and suppressing Republicans, including most blacks. They often solicited newspaper coverage for publicity to increase their threat. The scale of operations was such that in 1876, North Carolina had 20,000 men in rifle clubs. Made up of well-armed Confederate veterans, a class that covered most adult men who could have fought in the war, the paramilitary groups worked for political aims: to turn Republicans out of office, disrupt their organizing, and use force to intimidate and terrorize [[freedmen]] to keep them away from the polls. Such groups have been described as \"the military arm of the Democratic Party\".<ref>George C. Rable, ''But There Was No Peace: The Role of Violence in the Politics of Reconstruction'', Athens: University of Georgia Press, 1984, p. 132</ref>\n\nThey were instrumental in many Southern states in driving blacks away from the polls and ensuring a white [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] takeover of legislatures and governorships in most Southern states in the 1870s, most notoriously during the [[1876 United States presidential election|controversial 1876 elections]]. As a result of a national [[Compromise of 1877]] arising from the 1876 presidential election, the federal government withdrew its military forces from the South, formally ending the Reconstruction era. By that time, Southern Democrats had effectively regained control in [[Louisiana]], [[South Carolina]], and [[Florida]] \u2013 they identified as the [[Redeemers]]. In the South, the process of white Democrats regaining control of state governments has been called \"the Redemption\". African-American historians sometimes call the Compromise of 1877 \"The Great Betrayal\".<ref>{{cite web|title=Key Events in the Presidency of Rutherford B.

Other measures followed, particularly near the end of the century, after a Republican-Populist alliance caused the Democrats to temporarily lose some Congressional seats and control of some gubernatorial positions.\n\nTo secure their power, the Democrats worked to exclude blacks (and most Republicans) from politics. The results could be seen across the South. After Reconstruction, Tennessee initially had the most \"consistently competitive political system in the South\".<ref name=\"shaping\">J. Morgan Kousser, ''The Shaping of Southern Politics: Suffrage Restriction and the Establishment of the One-Party South, 1880\u20131910'', p.104</ref> A bitter election battle in 1888, marked by unmatched corruption and violence, resulted in white Democrats taking over the state legislature. To consolidate their power, they worked to suppress the black vote and sharply reduced it through changes in voter registration, requiring [[poll tax (United States)|poll taxes]], as well as changing election procedures to make voting more complex.\n\nIn 1890 Mississippi adopted a new constitution, which contained provisions for voter registration which required voters pay [[poll tax (United States)|poll taxes]] and pass a [[literacy test]]. The literacy test was subjectively applied by white administrators, and the two provisions effectively disenfranchised most blacks and many poor whites. The constitutional provisions survived a [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] challenge in ''[[Williams v. Mississippi]]'' (1898). Other southern states quickly adopted new constitutions and what they called the \"Mississippi plan\". By 1908, all states of the former Confederacy had passed new constitutions or suffrage amendments, sometimes bypassing general elections to achieve this. Legislators created a variety of barriers, including longer residency requirements, rule variations, literacy and understanding tests, which were subjectively applied against minorities, or were particularly hard for the poor to fulfill.<ref>[http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=224731 Richard H.

Then we had a constitutional convention convened which took the matter up calmly, deliberately, and avowedly with the purpose of disfranchising as many of them as we could under the fourteenth and fifteenth amendments.

Apportionment of seats was still based on total population (with the assumption of the usual number of voting males in relation to the residents); as a result white Southerners commanded a number of seats far out of proportion to the voters they represented.<ref name=\"committee\">[https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1900/12/21/102438623.pdf \u2018COMMITTEE AT ODDS ON REAPPORTIONMENT\u2019], ''The New York Times'', 20 Dec 1900, accessed 10 Mar 2008</ref> In the end, Congress did not act on this issue, as the Southern bloc of Democrats had sufficient power to reject or stall such action. For decades, white Southern Democrats exercised Congressional representation derived from a full count of the population, but they disfranchised several million black and white citizens. Southern white Democrats comprised the \"[[Solid South]]\", a powerful voting bloc in Congress until the mid-20th century. Their representatives, re-elected repeatedly by one-party states, exercised the power of seniority, controlling numerous chairmanships of important committees in both houses. Their power allowed them to have control over rules, budgets and important patronage projects, among other issues, as well as to defeat bills to make [[lynching]] a federal crime.<ref name=\"p10\"/>\n\n==New state constitutions, 1890 to 1908==\n{{See also|Voting rights in the United States}}\nDespite white Southerners' complaints about Reconstruction, several Southern states kept most provisions of their Reconstruction constitutions for more than two decades, until late in the 19th century.<ref>W.E.B. DuBois, ''Black Reconstruction in America, 1868\u20131880'', New York: Oxford University Press, 1935; reprint, New York: The Free Press, 1998</ref> In some states, the number of blacks elected to local offices reached a peak in the 1880s although Reconstruction had ended. They had an influence at the local level, where much of government took place, although they did not win many statewide or national seats. Subsequently, state legislatures passed restrictive laws or constitutions that made voter registration and election rules more complicated. As literacy tests and other restrictions could be applied subjectively, these changes sharply limited the vote by most blacks and, often, many poor whites; voter rolls dropped across the South into the new century.\n\n[[Florida]] approved a new constitution in 1885 that included provisions for [[poll tax (United States)|poll taxes]] as a prerequisite for voter registration and voting. From 1890 to 1908, ten of the eleven Southern states rewrote their constitutions.

Other states required otherwise eligible black voters to meet literacy and knowledge requirements to the satisfaction of white registrars, who applied subjective judgment and, in the process, rejected most black voters. By 1900, the majority of blacks were literate, but even many of the best-educated of these men continued to \"fail\" the literacy tests administered by white registrars.\n\nThe historian [[J. Morgan Kousser]] noted, \"Within the Democratic party, the chief impetus for restriction came from the black belt members,\" whom he identified as \"always socioeconomically privileged.\" In addition to wanting to affirm white supremacy, the [[planter (American South)|planter]] and business elite were concerned about voting by lower-class and uneducated whites. Kousser found, \"They disfranchised these whites as willingly as they deprived blacks of the vote.\"<ref>J. Morgan Kousser.''The Shaping of Southern Politics: Suffrage Restriction and the Establishment of the One-Party South'', New Haven: Yale University Press, 1974</ref> Perman noted the goals of disenfranchisement resulted from several factors. Competition between white elites and white lower classes, for example, and a desire to prevent alliances between lower-class white and black Americans, as had been seen in Populist-Republican alliances, led white Democratic legislators to restrict voter rolls.<ref name=\"Michael Perman 2001\" />\n\nWith the passage of new constitutions, Southern states adopted provisions that caused disenfranchisement of large portions of their populations by skirting US constitutional protections of the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments. While their voter registration requirements applied to all citizens, in practice they disenfranchised most blacks. As in Alabama, they also \"would remove [from voter registration rolls] the less educated, less organized, more impoverished whites as well \u2013 and that would ensure one-party Democratic rules through most of the 20th century in the South\".<ref name=\"p10\" /><ref name=\"Glenn Feldman 2004, pp. 135\u2013136\">Glenn Feldman, ''The Disfranchisement Myth: Poor Whites and Suffrage Restriction in Alabama'', Athens: University of Georgia Press, 2004, pp.&nbsp;135\u2013136</ref>\n\nThe new provisions of the state constitutions almost entirely eliminated black voting. Although nothing approaching precise data exists, it is estimated that in the late 1930s less than one percent of blacks in the Deep South and around five percent in the Rim South were registered to vote,<ref>Mickey, Robert; ''Paths Out of Dixie: The Democratization of Authoritarian Enclaves in America's Deep South, 1944-1972'', p. 87 {{ISBN|1400838789}}</ref> and that the proportion actually voting even in general elections, which were of no consequence due to complete Democratic dominance, was much smaller still. Secondly, the Democratic legislatures passed [[Jim Crow laws]] to assert white supremacy, establish [[racial segregation]] in public facilities, and treat blacks as second-class citizens. The landmark court decision in ''[[Plessy v. Ferguson]]'' (1896) held that \"separate but equal\" facilities, as on railroad cars, were constitutional. The new constitutions passed numerous Supreme Court challenges. In cases where a particular restriction was overruled by the Supreme Court in the early 20th century, states quickly devised new methods of excluding most blacks from voting, such as the [[white primary]]. Democratic Party primaries became the only competitive contests in southern states.\n\nFor the national Democratic Party, the alignment after Reconstruction resulted in a powerful Southern region that was useful for congressional clout. Nevertheless, prior to President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]], the \"Solid South\" inhibited the national party from fulfilling center-left initiatives{{clarify|date=February 2017}} desired since the days of [[William Jennings Bryan]]. [[Woodrow Wilson#Segregation in the federal government|Woodrow Wilson]], one of two Democrats elected to the presidency between Abraham Lincoln and [[Franklin D.

The literacy test was administered by the voting registrar; in practice, they were white Democrats. Provisions in the constitution also included a [[grandfather clause]], which provided a loophole to enable illiterate whites to register to vote. It said that \"Any citizen who was a voter on January 1, 1867, or his son or grandson, or any person naturalized prior to January 1, 1898, if applying for registration before September 1, 1898, might vote, notwithstanding illiteracy or poverty.\" Separate registration lists were kept for whites and blacks, making it easy for white registrars to discriminate against blacks in literacy tests. The constitution of 1898 also required a person to satisfy a longer [[residency requirement]] in the state, county, parish, and precinct before voting than did the constitution of 1879. This worked against the lower classes, who were more likely to move frequently for work, especially in agricultural areas where there were many migrant workers and sharecroppers.\n\nThe effect of these changes on the population of black voters in Louisiana was devastating; by 1900 black voters were reduced from 130,334 to 5,320 on the rolls. By 1910, only 730 blacks were registered, less than 0.5% of eligible black men. \"In 27 of the state's sixty parishes, not a single black voter was registered any longer; in nine more parishes, only one black voter was.\"<ref name=\"p12\"/>\n\n===North Carolina===\nIn 1894, a coalition of Republicans and the [[Populist Party (United States)|Populist Party]] won control of the North Carolina state legislature (and with it, the ability to elect two US Senators) and were successful in electing several US Representatives elected through [[electoral fusion]].<ref name=\"fusion\">{{cite web|url=http://www.northcarolinahistory.org/encyclopedia/58/entry|title=Fusion Politics - North Carolina History Project|first=Website design and web development by Mango Web Design|last=http://mangowebdesign.com|website=northcarolinahistory.org|accessdate=2 September 2017}}</ref> The fusion coalition made impressive gains in the 1896 election when their legislative majority expanded. Republican [[Daniel Lindsay Russell]] won the gubernatorial race in 1897, the first Republican governor of the state since the end of Reconstruction in 1877. The election also resulted in more than 1,000 elected or appointed black officials, including the election in 1897 of [[George Henry White]] to Congress, as a member of the House of Representatives.\n\nAt the 1898 election, the Democrats ran on [[White Supremacy]] and disenfranchisement in a bitter race-baiting campaign led by [[Furnifold McLendel Simmons]] and [[Josephus Daniels]], editor and publisher of ''[[The News & Observer|The Raleigh News & Observer]].'' The Republican/Populist coalition disintegrated, and the Democrats won the North Carolina 1898 election and the following 1900 election. Simmons was elected as the state's US senator in 1900, holding office until 1931 through multiple re-elections by the state legislature and by popular vote after 1920.\n\nThe Democrats used their power in the state legislature to disenfranchise minorities, primarily blacks, and ensure that Democratic Party and white power would not be threatened again.<ref name=\"shaping\" /><ref name=\"fusion\" /><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lib.unc.edu/ncc/1898/1898.html|title=The North Carolina Election of 1898 \u00b7 UNC Libraries|website=www.lib.unc.edu|accessdate=2 September 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090427010250/http://www.lib.unc.edu/ncc/1898/1898.html|archive-date=27 April 2009|url-status=dead}}</ref> They passed laws restricting voter registration. In 1900 the Democrats adopted a constitutional suffrage amendment which lengthened the residence period required before registration, and enacted both an educational qualification (to be assessed by a registrar, which meant that it could be subjectively applied) and prepayment of a [[poll tax]]. A [[grandfather clause]] exempted from the poll tax those entitled to vote on January 1, 1867.<ref name=\"Pildes\"/> The legislature also passed [[Jim Crow]] laws establishing racial [[Racial segregation in the United States|segregation]] in public facilities and transportation.\n\nThe effect in North Carolina was the complete elimination of black voters from voter rolls by 1904.

The Readjuster Party held control from 1881 to 1883, electing a governor and controlling the legislature, which also elected a US Senator from the state. As in North Carolina, state Democrats were able to divide Readjuster supporters through appeals to White Supremacy. After regaining power, Democrats changed state laws and the constitution in 1902 to disenfranchise blacks. They ratified the new constitution in the legislature and did not submit it to popular vote. Voting in Virginia fell by nearly half as a result of the disenfranchisement of blacks.<ref name=\"historical\"/><ref name = \"Dabney\"/> The eighty-year stretch of white Democratic control ended only in the late 1960s after passage and enforcement of the federal [[Voting Rights Act]] of 1965 and the collapse of the [[Byrd Organization]] machine.\n\n===Border States: failed disenfranchisement===\nThe five [[border states (American Civil War)|border states]] of Delaware, Maryland, West Virginia, Kentucky and Missouri, had legacies similar to the Confederate slave states from the Civil War. The Border States, all slave states, also established laws requiring racial segregation between the 1880s and 1900s; however, disenfranchisement of blacks was never attained to any significant degree. Most Border States did attempt such disenfranchisement during the 1900s.\n\nThe causes of failure to disenfranchise blacks and poor whites in the Border States, as compared to their success for well over half a century in former Confederate states, were complicated. During the 1900s Maryland was vigorously divided between supporters and opponents of disenfranchisement, but it had a large and increasingly educated black community concentrated in Baltimore. This city had many free blacks before the Civil War and they had established both economic and political power.<ref name=\"Here\">Smith, C.

Many states required payment of the tax at a time separate from the election, and then required voters to bring receipts with them to the polls. If they could not locate such receipts, they could not vote. In addition, many states surrounded registration and voting with other complex record-keeping requirements.<ref name=\"Andrews\" /> These were particularly difficult for sharecropper and tenant farmers to comply with, as they moved frequently.\n\nThe poll tax was sometimes used alone or together with a literacy qualification. In a kind of [[grandfather clause]], North Carolina in 1900 exempted from the poll tax those men entitled to vote as of January 1, 1867. This excluded all blacks in the State, who did not have suffrage before that date.<ref name=Pildes />\n\n===Educational and character requirements===\nAlabama, Arkansas, Mississippi, South Carolina and Tennessee, created an educational requirement, with review by a local registrar of a voter's qualifications. In 1898 Georgia rejected such a device.\n\nAlabama delegates at first hesitated, out of concern that illiterate whites would lose their votes.  After the legislature stated that the new constitution would not disenfranchise any white voters and that it would be submitted to the people for ratification, Alabama passed an educational requirement. It was ratified at the polls in November 1901. Its distinctive feature was the \"good character clause\" (also known as the \"[[grandfather clause]]\"). An appointment board in each county could register \"all voters under the present [previous] law\" who were veterans or the lawful descendants of such, and \"all who are of good character and understand the duties and obligations of citizenship\". This gave the board discretion to approve voters on a case-by-case basis. In practice, they enfranchised many whites, but rejected both poor whites and blacks. Most of the latter had been slaves and unable to attain military service.<ref name=\"Andrews\" />\n\nSouth Carolina, Louisiana (1889), and later, Virginia incorporated an educational requirement in their new constitutions. In 1902 Virginia adopted a constitution with the \"understanding\" clause as a literacy test to use until 1904. In addition, application for registration had to be in the applicant's handwriting and written in the presence of the registrar. Thus, someone who could not write, could not vote.<ref name=\"Andrews\" />\n\n===Eight Box Law===\n<!-- linked from [[Jim Crow laws]] (do not change this header--will break the link) -->\nBy 1882, the Democrats were firmly in power in [[South Carolina]]. Republican voters were mostly limited to the majority-black counties of [[Beaufort County, South Carolina|Beaufort]] and [[Georgetown County, South Carolina|Georgetown]]. Because the state had a large black-majority population (nearly sixty percent [[1890 United States Census|in 1890]]),<ref name=rogersJr/> white Democrats had narrow margins in many counties and feared a possible resurgence of black Republican voters at the polls. To remove the black threat, the [[South Carolina General Assembly|General Assembly]] created an indirect literacy test, called the \"Eight Box Law\".\n\nThe law required a separate box for ballots for each office; a voter had to insert the ballot into the corresponding box or it would not count. The ballots could not have party symbols on them. They had to be of a correct size and type of paper. Many ballots were arbitrarily rejected because they slightly deviated from the requirements. Ballots could also randomly be rejected if there were more ballots in a box than registered voters.<ref name=\"Holt\">{{cite book\n  | last =Holt\n  | first =Thomas\n  | authorlink =Thomas C.

On May 8, 1895, Judge Goff of the United States Circuit Court declared the provision unconstitutional and enjoined the state from taking further action under it. But in June 1895, the US Circuit Court of Appeals reversed Judge Goff and dissolved the injunction, leaving the way open for a convention.\n\nThe constitutional convention met on September 10 and adjourned on December 4, 1895. By the new constitution, South Carolina adopted the Mississippi Plan until January 1, 1898. Any male citizen could be registered who was able to read a section of the constitution or to satisfy the election officer that he understood it when read to him. Those thus registered were to remain voters for life. Under the new constitution and application of literacy practices, black voters were dropped in great number from the registration rolls: by 1896, in a state where according to the 1890 census blacks numbered 728,934 and comprised nearly sixty percent of the total population,<ref name=rogersJr>{{cite book | first = George C. and C.

In practice, these had disenfranchised blacks, as had occurred in numerous Southern states. This decision affected similar provisions in the constitutions of Alabama, Georgia, Louisiana, North Carolina, and Virginia election rules. Oklahoma and other states quickly reacted by passing laws that created other rules for voter registration that worked against blacks and minorities.<ref>Richard M. Valelly, ''The Two Reconstructions: The Struggle for Black Enfranchisement'', Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 2004, p.141</ref> ''Guinn'' was the first of many cases in which the NAACP filed a brief challenging discriminatory electoral rules.\n\nIn ''[[Lane v. Wilson]]'' (1939), the Supreme Court invalidated an Oklahoma provision designed to disenfranchise blacks. It had replaced the clause struck down in ''Guinn.''  This clause permanently disenfranchised everyone qualified to vote who had not registered to vote in a twelve-day window between April 30 and May 11, 1916, except for those who had voted in 1914. While designed to be more resistant to challenges based on discrimination, as the law did not specifically mention race, the Court struck it down partially because it relied on the 1914 election, when voters had been discriminated against under the rule invalidated in ''Guinn.''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://supreme.justia.com/us/307/268/case.html|title=Lane v.

These became common for all elections. As the Democratic Party was dominant and the only competitive voting was in the primaries, barring minority voters from the primaries was another means of excluding them from politics. Court challenges overturned the white primary system, but many states then passed laws that authorized political  parties to set up the rules for their own systems, such as the white primary. Texas, for instance, passed such a state law in 1923. It was used to bar Mexican Americans as well as black Americans from voting; it survived challenges to the US Supreme Court until the 1940s.<ref>[http://texaspolitics.laits.utexas.edu/6_5_3.html ''Texas Politics: Historical Barriers to Voting''], accessed 11 Apr 2008 {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080402060131/http://texaspolitics.laits.utexas.edu/html/vce/0503.html |date=April 2, 2008 }}</ref>\n\n==Congressional response==\nThe North had heard the South's version of Reconstruction abuses, such as financial corruption, high taxes, and incompetent freedmen. Industry wanted to invest in the South and not worry about political problems. In addition, reconciliation between white veterans of the North and South reached a peak in the early 20th century. As historian [[David Blight]] demonstrated in ''Race and Reunion: The Civil War in American Memory'', reconciliation meant the pushing aside by whites of the major issues of race and suffrage. Southern whites were effective for many years at having their version of history accepted, especially as it was confirmed in ensuing decades by influential historians of the [[Dunning School]] at [[Columbia University]] and other institutions.\n\nDisfranchisement of black Americans in the South was covered by national newspapers and magazines as new laws and constitutions were created, and many Northerners were outraged and alarmed. The [[Lodge Bill]] or Federal Elections Bill or Lodge Force Bill of 1890 was a bill drafted by Representative [[Henry Cabot Lodge]] (R) of Massachusetts, and sponsored in the Senate by [[George Frisbie Hoar]]. It would have authorized federal electors to supervise elections under certain conditions. Due to a Senate filibuster, as well as trade-off of support with Democrats by western [[Silver Republican Party|Silver Republicans]], the bill failed to pass.<ref>Keyssar, Alexander ; ''The Right to Vote: The Contested History of Democracy in the United States'', Basic Books, 2000/2009, p. 86 {{ISBN|0465005020}}</ref><ref>Wendy Hazard, 'Thomas Brackett Reed, Civil Rights, and the Fight for Fair Elections,' '' Maine History'', March 2004, Vol. 42 Issue 1, pp 1\u201323</ref>\n\nIn 1900 the Committee of Census of Congress considered proposals for adding more seats to the House of Representatives because of increased population. Proposals ranged for a total number of seats from 357 to 386. [[Edgar D. Crumpacker]] (R-IN) filed an independent report urging that the Southern states be stripped of seats due to the large numbers of voters they had disfranchised.

Because they were disfranchised, blacks could not serve on juries, and whites were clearly aligned against them on this and other racial issues.\n\n{{anchor|Tinkham}}\nDespite the Lever decision and domination of Congress by Democrats, some Northern Congressmen continued to raise the issue of black disfranchisement and resulting malapportionment. For instance, on December 6, 1920, Representative [[George H. Tinkham]] (R-MA) offered a resolution for the Committee of Census to investigate alleged disfranchisement of blacks. His intention was to enforce the provisions of the Fourteenth and Fifteenth amendments.<ref name=\"tinkham\"/>\n\nIn addition, he believed there should be reapportionment in the House related to the voting population of southern states, rather than the general population as enumerated in the census.<ref name=\"tinkham\"/> Such reapportionment was authorized by the Constitution and would reflect reality, so that the South should not get credit for people and voters it had disfranchised.

[https://www.jstor.org/stable/273560 in JSTOR]</ref>  The NAACP lobbied for commissioning of African Americans as officers in World War I. It was arranged for W.E.B. Du Bois to receive an Army commission, but he failed his physical.  In 1915 the NAACP organized public education and protests in cities across the nation against D.W. Griffith's film ''[[Birth of a Nation]]'', a film that glamorized the Ku Klux Klan and shown in the Wilson White House as a personal favor to its author, a college roommate of President Wilson.  Boston and a few other cities refused to allow the film to open.\n\n==Legislative and cultural effects==\n===20th-century Supreme Court decisions===\nBlack Americans and their allies worked hard to regain their ability to exercise the constitutional rights of citizens. [[Booker T. Washington]], widely known for his accommodationist approach as the leader of the [[Tuskegee Institute]], called on northern backers to help finance legal challenges to disenfranchisement and segregation. He raised substantial funds and also arranged for representation on some cases, such as the two for Giles in Alabama. He challenged the state's grandfather clause and a citizenship test required for new voters, which was administered in a discriminatory way against blacks.<ref>[http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=224731 Richard H.

Harris]]'' (1903), the [[United States Supreme Court]] under Justice [[Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr.]] effectively upheld such southern voter registration provisions in dealing with a challenge to the Alabama constitution. Its decision said the provisions were not targeted at blacks and thus did not deprive them of rights. This has been characterized as the \"most momentous ignored decision\" in constitutional history.<ref>[http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=224731 Richard H. Pildes, 'Democracy, Anti-Democracy, and the Canon', ''Constitutional Commentary'', Vol. 17, 2000, p.32] Accessed 10 Mar 2008</ref>\n\nTrying to deal with the grounds of the Court's ruling, Giles mounted another challenge. In ''[[Giles v. Teasley]]'' (1904), the U.S. Supreme Court upheld Alabama's disenfranchising constitution. That same year the Congress refused to overturn a disputed election, and essentially sent plaintiffs back to the state courts. Even when black plaintiffs gained rulings in their favor from the Supreme Court, states quickly devised alternative ways to exclude them from the political process. It was not until later in the 20th century that such legal challenges on disenfranchisement began to meet more success in the courts.\n\nWith the founding of the [[National Association for the Advancement of Colored People]] (NAACP) in 1909, the interracial group based in New York began to provide financial and strategic support to lawsuits on voting issues. What became the [[NAACP Legal Defense Fund]] organized and mounted numerous cases in repeated court and legal challenges to the many barriers of segregation, including disenfranchisement provisions of the states. The NAACP often represented plaintiffs directly, or helped raise funds to support legal challenges. The NAACP also worked at public education, lobbying of Congress, demonstrations, and encouragement of theater and academic writing as other means to reach the public. NAACP chapters were organized in cities across the country, and membership increased rapidly in the South. The [[American Civil Liberties Union]] also represented plaintiffs in some disenfranchisement cases.\n\n===Successful challenges===\nIn ''[[Smith v. Allwright]]'' (1944), the Supreme Court reviewed a Texas case and ruled against the [[white primary]]; the state legislature had authorized the Democratic Party to devise its own rules of operation. The 1944 court ruling was that this was unconstitutional, as the state had failed to protect the constitutional rights of its citizens.\n\nFollowing the 1944 ruling, civil rights organizations in major cities moved quickly to register black voters. For instance, in Georgia, in 1940 only 20,000 blacks had managed to register to vote. After the Supreme Court decision, the All-Citizens Registration Committee (ACRC) of Atlanta started organizing. By 1947 they and others had succeeded in getting 125,000 black Americans registered, 18.8% of those of eligible age.<ref>Chandler Davidson and Bernard Grofman, ''Quiet Revolution in the South: The Impact of the Voting Rights Act'', Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1994, p.70</ref>\n\nEach legal victory was followed by white-dominated legislatures' renewed efforts to control black voting through different exclusionary schemes. In the 1940s, Alabama passed a law to give white registrars more discretion in testing applicants for comprehension and literacy. In 1958 Georgia passed a new voter registration act that required those who were illiterate to satisfy \"understanding tests\" by correctly answering 20 of 30 questions related to citizenship posed by the voting registrar. Blacks had made substantial advances in education, but the individual white registrars were the sole persons to determine whether individual prospective voters answered correctly. In practice, registrars disqualified most black voters, whether they were educated or not. In Terrell County, for instance, which was 64% black in population, after passage of the act, only 48 black Americans were able to register to vote in 1958.<ref>Davidson and Grofman (1994), ''Quiet Revolution in the South'', p. 71</ref>\n\n==Civil Rights Movement==\n{{Main|Civil Rights Movement}}\nThe NAACP's steady progress with individual cases was thwarted by southern Democrats' continuing resistance and passage of new statutory barriers to blacks' exercising the franchise. Through the 1950s and 1960s, private citizens enlarged the effort by becoming activists throughout the South, led by many black churches and their leaders, and joined by both young and older activists from northern states. Nonviolent confrontation and demonstrations were mounted in numerous Southern cities, often provoking violent reaction by white bystanders and authorities. The moral crusade of the [[Civil Rights Movement]] gained national media coverage, attention across the country, and a growing national demand for change.\n\nWidespread violence against the [[Freedom Riders]] in 1961, which was covered by television and newspapers, the murders of activists in Alabama in 1963 gained support for the activists' cause at the national level. President [[John F. Kennedy]] introduced civil rights legislation to Congress in 1963 before he was assassinated.\n\nPresident [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] took up the charge. In January 1964, Johnson met with civil rights leaders. On January 8, during his first [[State of the Union (USA)|State of the Union address]], Johnson asked Congress to \"let this session of Congress be known as the session which did more for civil rights than the last hundred sessions combined.\" On January 23, 1964, the [[Twenty-fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution|24th Amendment]] to the U.S. Constitution, prohibiting the use of [[poll tax (United States)|poll taxes]] in national elections, was ratified with the approval of [[South Dakota]], the 38th state to do so.\n\nOn June 21, 1964, civil rights workers [[Michael Schwerner]], [[Andrew Goodman (activist)|Andrew Goodman]], and [[James Chaney]], disappeared in [[Neshoba County, Mississippi]]. The three were volunteers aiding in the registration of black voters as part of the [[Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party|Mississippi Freedom Summer Project]]. Forty-four days later the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] recovered their bodies from an earthen dam where they were buried. The Neshoba County deputy sheriff Cecil Price and 16 others, all [[Ku Klux Klan]] members, were indicted for the murders; seven were convicted. The investigation also revealed the bodies of several black men, whose deaths had never been revealed or prosecuted by white law enforcement officials.\n\nWhen the Civil Rights Bill came before the full Senate for debate on March 30, 1964, the \"Southern Bloc\" of 18 southern Democratic Senators and one Republican Senator, led by [[Richard Russell, Jr.|Richard Russell]] (D-GA), launched a [[filibuster]] to prevent its passage.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.congresslink.org/print_basics_histmats_civilrights64text.htm |title=Major Features of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 |publisher=Congresslink.org |accessdate=2010-06-06 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141206191323/http://www.congresslink.org/print_basics_histmats_civilrights64text.htm |archivedate=2014-12-06 }}</ref> Russell said:\n\n{{quote|We will resist to the bitter end any measure or any movement which would have a tendency to bring about [[social equality]] and [[miscegenation|intermingling and amalgamation of the races]] in our (Southern) states.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://spartacus-educational.com/USAcivil64.htm |title=Civil Rights Act of 1964 |publisher=Spartacus-Educational.com |accessdate=2019-02-27 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100516142923/http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/USAcivil64.htm |archivedate=2010-05-16 }}</ref>}}\n\nAfter 57 working days of filibuster, and several compromises, the Senate had enough votes (71 to 29) to end the debate and the filibuster. It was the first time that Southern senators had failed to win with such tactics against civil rights bills. On July 2, President Johnson signed into law the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]].<ref>{{cite web\n |title       = Civil Rights during the administration of Lyndon B.

It did not explicitly ban [[literacy tests]], which had been used to disqualify blacks and poor white voters.\n\nAs the [[United States Department of Justice]] has stated:\n\n<blockquote>By 1965 concerted efforts to break the grip of state disenfranchisement (sic) had been under way for some time, but had achieved only modest success overall and in some areas had proved almost entirely ineffectual. The murder of voting-rights activists in [[Philadelphia, Mississippi]], gained national attention, along with numerous other acts of violence and terrorism. Finally, the unprovoked attack on March 7, 1965, by state troopers on peaceful marchers crossing the [[Edmund Pettus Bridge]] in [[Selma, Alabama]], en route to the state capitol in [[Montgomery, Alabama|Montgomery]], persuaded the President and Congress to overcome Southern legislators' resistance to effective voting rights legislation. President Johnson issued a call for a strong voting rights law and hearings began soon thereafter on the bill that would become the [[Voting Rights Act]].<ref>{{cite web\n |title       = Introduction To Federal Voting Rights Laws\n |url         = http://www.usdoj.gov/crt/voting/intro/intro_b.htm\n |publisher   = United States Department of Justice\n |accessdate  = 2007-02-25\n |url-status     = dead\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20070304111738/http://www.usdoj.gov/crt/voting/intro/intro_b.htm\n |archivedate = 2007-03-04\n}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nPassed in 1965, this law prohibited the use of literacy tests as a requirement to register to vote. It provided for recourse for local voters to federal oversight and intervention, plus federal monitoring of areas that historically had low voter turnouts to ensure that new measures were not taken against minority voters. It provided for federal enforcement of voting rights. African Americans began to enter the formal political process, most in the South for the first time in their lives. They have since won numerous seats and offices at local, state and federal levels.\n\n==See also==\n* [[African-American history]]\n* [[Civil rights movement (1865\u20131896)]]\n* [[Civil rights movement (1896\u20131954)]]\n* [[List of 19th-century African-American civil rights activists]]\n* [[Timeline of the civil rights movement]]\n* [[Felony disenfranchisement]]\n* [[Jim Crow laws]]\n* [[Nadir of American race relations]]\n* [[Judicial aspects of race in the United States]]\n* [[Voting rights in the United States]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist| group=\"nb\"}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* Grantham, Dewey W.

Their actions were designed to thwart the objective of the [[Fifteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifteenth Amendment]] to the [[United States Constitution]], [[ratified]] in 1870, which sought to protect the [[Voting rights in the United States|suffrage]] of [[freedmen]] after the [[American Civil War]].\n\nDuring the later elections of [[Reconstruction Era|Reconstruction]] era, beginning in the 1870s, [[White people|white]] [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]] used violence by [[paramilitary]] groups, as well as fraud, to suppress black [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] voters and turn Republicans out of office.  After regaining control of the state legislatures, Democrats were alarmed by a late 19th-century alliance between Republicans and Populists that cost them some elections. After achieving control of state legislatures, white Democrats added to previous efforts and achieved widespread disenfranchisement by law: from 1890 to 1908, Southern state legislatures passed new constitutions, constitutional amendments, and laws that made voter registration and voting more difficult, especially when administered by white staff in a discriminatory way. They succeeded in disenfranchising most of the black citizens, as well as many [[Poor White|poor whites]] in the South, and voter rolls dropped dramatically in each state. The Republican Party was nearly eliminated in the region for decades, and the Democrats established one-party control throughout the southern states.<ref>Valelly, Richard M.; ''The Two Reconstructions: The Struggle for Black Enfranchisement'' University of Chicago Press, 2009, pp. 134-139 {{ISBN|9780226845302}}</ref>\n\nIn 1912, the Republican Party was split when Roosevelt ran against the party regular, Taft. In the South by this time, the Republican Party had been hollowed out by the disenfranchisement of African Americans, who were largely excluded from voting. Democrat [[Woodrow Wilson]] was elected as the first southern [[President of the United States|President]] since 1856. He was re-elected in 1916, in a much closer presidential contest. During his first term, Wilson satisfied the request of Southerners in his cabinet and instituted overt [[Racial segregation in the United States|racial segregation]] throughout federal government workplaces, as well as [[racial discrimination]] in hiring.<ref name=\"Teachingamericanhistory.org\">{{cite web |url=http://teachingamericanhistory.org/library/index.asp?documentprint=1115 |title=Another Open Letter to Woodrow Wilson W.E.B.

In addition, because black Southerners were not listed on local voter rolls, they were automatically excluded from [[jury duty|serving in local courts]]. Juries were [[all-white jury|all white]] across the South.\n\nPolitical disenfranchisement did not end until after passage of the [[Voting Rights Act of 1965]], which authorized the federal government to monitor voter registration practices and elections where populations were historically underrepresented, and to enforce constitutional voting rights. The challenge to voting rights has continued into the 21st century, as shown by numerous court cases in 2016 alone, though attempts to restrict voting rights for political advantage have not been confined to the Southern states. Another method of seeking political advantage through the voting system is the [[Gerrymandering in the United States|gerrymandering of electoral boundaries]], as was the case of North Carolina, which in January 2018 was declared by a federal court to be unconstitutional.<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/09/us/north-carolina-gerrymander.html North Carolina Is Ordered to Redraw Its Congressional Map]</ref> Such cases are expected to reach the Supreme Court.<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/11/us/gerrymander-court-north-carolina-pennsylvania.html Is Partisan Gerrymandering Legal?

Congress passed the [[Reconstruction Acts]], starting in 1867, establishing military districts to oversee the affairs of these states pending reconstruction.\n\nDuring the Reconstruction era, blacks constituted absolute majorities of the populations in [[Mississippi]] and [[South Carolina]], were equal to the white population in Louisiana, and represented more than 40 percent of the population in four other former Confederate states. Southern whites, fearing black domination, resisted the [[freedmen]]'s exercise of political power.<ref>Gabriel J. Chin & Randy Wagner, \"The Tyranny of the Minority: Jim Crow and the Counter-Majoritarian Difficulty,\" [http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=963036&high=%20Gabriel%20CHin 43 ''Harvard Civil Rights-Civil Liberties Law Review'' 65 (2008)]</ref> In 1867, black men voted for the first time. By the [[1868 United States presidential election|1868 presidential election]], Texas, Mississippi, and Virginia had still not been re-admitted to the Union. General [[Ulysses S. Grant]] was elected as president thanks in part to 700,000 black voters. In February 1870, the Fifteenth Amendment was ratified; it was designed to protect blacks' right to vote from infringement by the states.\n\nWhite supremacist [[paramilitary]] organizations, allied with Southern Democrats, used intimidation, violence and even committed assassinations in order to repress blacks and prevent them from exercising their [[civil and political rights]] in elections from 1868 until the mid-1870s. The insurgent [[Ku Klux Klan]] (KKK) was formed in 1865 in [[Tennessee]] (as a backlash to defeat in the war) and it quickly became a powerful secret [[vigilante]] group, with chapters across the South. The Klan initiated a campaign of intimidation directed against blacks and sympathetic whites. Their violence included [[vandalism]] and destruction of property, physical attacks and assassinations, and [[lynching]]s. Teachers who came from the North to teach freedmen were sometimes attacked or intimidated as well.\n\nThe toll of Klan murders and attacks led [[United States Congress|Congress]] to pass laws to end the violence. In 1870, the strongly [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] Congress passed the [[Enforcement Acts]], imposing penalties for conspiracy to deny black suffrage.<ref name=\"Andrews\">{{cite book\n  | last =Andrews\n  | first =E.

Organizations whose members appeared in arms were considered in rebellion against the United States. The President could suspend ''[[habeas corpus]]'' under those circumstances. President Grant used these provisions in parts of the [[Carolinas]] in late 1871. United States marshals supervised state voter registrations and elections and could summon the help of military or naval forces if needed.<ref name=\"Andrews\" /> These measures led to the demise of the first Klan by the early 1870s.\n\nNew paramilitary groups quickly sprang up, as tens of thousands of veterans belonged to gun clubs and similar groups. A second wave of violence began, resulting in over 1,000 deaths, usually black or Republican. The [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] ruled in 1876 in ''[[United States v. Cruikshank]]'', arising from trials related to the [[Colfax Massacre]], that protections of the Fourteenth Amendment, which the Enforcement Acts were intended to support, did not apply to the actions of individuals, but only to the actions of state governments. They recommended that persons seek relief from state courts, which had not been supportive of freedmen's rights.\n\nThe [[paramilitary]] organizations that arose in the mid to late 1870s were part of continuing [[insurgency]] in the South after the Civil War, as armed veterans in the South resisted social changes, and worked to prevent black Americans and other Republicans from voting and running for office. Such groups included the [[White League]], formed in Louisiana in 1874 from white [[militias]], with chapters forming in other Southern states; the [[Red Shirts (Southern United States)|Red Shirts]], formed in 1875 in Mississippi but also active in [[North Carolina]] and South Carolina; and other \"White Liners,\" such as [[rifle clubs]] and the [[Knights of the White Camellia]]. Compared to the Klan, they were open societies, better organized and devoted to the political goal of regaining control of the state legislatures and suppressing Republicans, including most blacks. They often solicited newspaper coverage for publicity to increase their threat. The scale of operations was such that in 1876, North Carolina had 20,000 men in rifle clubs. Made up of well-armed Confederate veterans, a class that covered most adult men who could have fought in the war, the paramilitary groups worked for political aims: to turn Republicans out of office, disrupt their organizing, and use force to intimidate and terrorize [[freedmen]] to keep them away from the polls. Such groups have been described as \"the military arm of the Democratic Party\".<ref>George C. Rable, ''But There Was No Peace: The Role of Violence in the Politics of Reconstruction'', Athens: University of Georgia Press, 1984, p. 132</ref>\n\nThey were instrumental in many Southern states in driving blacks away from the polls and ensuring a white [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] takeover of legislatures and governorships in most Southern states in the 1870s, most notoriously during the [[1876 United States presidential election|controversial 1876 elections]]. As a result of a national [[Compromise of 1877]] arising from the 1876 presidential election, the federal government withdrew its military forces from the South, formally ending the Reconstruction era. By that time, Southern Democrats had effectively regained control in [[Louisiana]], [[South Carolina]], and [[Florida]] \u2013 they identified as the [[Redeemers]]. In the South, the process of white Democrats regaining control of state governments has been called \"the Redemption\". African-American historians sometimes call the Compromise of 1877 \"The Great Betrayal\".<ref>{{cite web|title=Key Events in the Presidency of Rutherford B.

Other measures followed, particularly near the end of the century, after a Republican-Populist alliance caused the Democrats to temporarily lose some Congressional seats and control of some gubernatorial positions.\n\nTo secure their power, the Democrats worked to exclude blacks (and most Republicans) from politics. The results could be seen across the South. After Reconstruction, Tennessee initially had the most \"consistently competitive political system in the South\".<ref name=\"shaping\">J. Morgan Kousser, ''The Shaping of Southern Politics: Suffrage Restriction and the Establishment of the One-Party South, 1880\u20131910'', p.104</ref> A bitter election battle in 1888, marked by unmatched corruption and violence, resulted in white Democrats taking over the state legislature. To consolidate their power, they worked to suppress the black vote and sharply reduced it through changes in voter registration, requiring [[poll tax (United States)|poll taxes]], as well as changing election procedures to make voting more complex.\n\nIn 1890 Mississippi adopted a new constitution, which contained provisions for voter registration which required voters pay [[poll tax (United States)|poll taxes]] and pass a [[literacy test]]. The literacy test was subjectively applied by white administrators, and the two provisions effectively disenfranchised most blacks and many poor whites. The constitutional provisions survived a [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] challenge in ''[[Williams v. Mississippi]]'' (1898). Other southern states quickly adopted new constitutions and what they called the \"Mississippi plan\". By 1908, all states of the former Confederacy had passed new constitutions or suffrage amendments, sometimes bypassing general elections to achieve this. Legislators created a variety of barriers, including longer residency requirements, rule variations, literacy and understanding tests, which were subjectively applied against minorities, or were particularly hard for the poor to fulfill.<ref>[http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=224731 Richard H.

You had set us an impossible task.<br/><br/>We did not disfranchise the negroes until 1895. Then we had a constitutional convention convened which took the matter up calmly, deliberately, and avowedly with the purpose of disfranchising as many of them as we could under the fourteenth and fifteenth amendments. We adopted the educational qualification as the only means left to us, and the negro is as contented and as prosperous and as well protected in South Carolina to-day as in any State of the Union south of the Potomac. He is not meddling with politics, for he found that the more he meddled with them the worse off he got. As to his \u201crights\u201d\u2014I will not discuss them now.

Apportionment of seats was still based on total population (with the assumption of the usual number of voting males in relation to the residents); as a result white Southerners commanded a number of seats far out of proportion to the voters they represented.<ref name=\"committee\">[https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1900/12/21/102438623.pdf \u2018COMMITTEE AT ODDS ON REAPPORTIONMENT\u2019], ''The New York Times'', 20 Dec 1900, accessed 10 Mar 2008</ref> In the end, Congress did not act on this issue, as the Southern bloc of Democrats had sufficient power to reject or stall such action. For decades, white Southern Democrats exercised Congressional representation derived from a full count of the population, but they disfranchised several million black and white citizens. Southern white Democrats comprised the \"[[Solid South]]\", a powerful voting bloc in Congress until the mid-20th century. Their representatives, re-elected repeatedly by one-party states, exercised the power of seniority, controlling numerous chairmanships of important committees in both houses. Their power allowed them to have control over rules, budgets and important patronage projects, among other issues, as well as to defeat bills to make [[lynching]] a federal crime.<ref name=\"p10\"/>\n\n==New state constitutions, 1890 to 1908==\n{{See also|Voting rights in the United States}}\nDespite white Southerners' complaints about Reconstruction, several Southern states kept most provisions of their Reconstruction constitutions for more than two decades, until late in the 19th century.<ref>W.E.B. DuBois, ''Black Reconstruction in America, 1868\u20131880'', New York: Oxford University Press, 1935; reprint, New York: The Free Press, 1998</ref> In some states, the number of blacks elected to local offices reached a peak in the 1880s although Reconstruction had ended. They had an influence at the local level, where much of government took place, although they did not win many statewide or national seats. Subsequently, state legislatures passed restrictive laws or constitutions that made voter registration and election rules more complicated. As literacy tests and other restrictions could be applied subjectively, these changes sharply limited the vote by most blacks and, often, many poor whites; voter rolls dropped across the South into the new century.\n\n[[Florida]] approved a new constitution in 1885 that included provisions for [[poll tax (United States)|poll taxes]] as a prerequisite for voter registration and voting. From 1890 to 1908, ten of the eleven Southern states rewrote their constitutions. All included provisions that effectively restricted voter registration and suffrage, including requirements for poll taxes, increased residency, and subjective [[literacy tests]].<ref name=\"Michael Perman 2001\">Michael Perman.''Struggle for Mastery: Disfranchisement in the South, 1888\u20131908''. Chapel Hill: North Carolina Press, 2001, Introduction</ref>\n\nWith educational improvements, blacks had markedly increased their rate of literacy. By 1891, their illiteracy had declined to 58 percent, whilst the rate of white illiteracy in the South at that time was 31 percent.<ref>[http://www.sefatl.org/1878.asp 1878\u20131895: Disenfranchisement (sic), Southern Education Foundation] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080607074413/http://www.sefatl.org/1878.asp |date=2008-06-07 }}, accessed 16 Mar 2008</ref> Some states used [[grandfather clause]]s to exempt white voters from literacy tests altogether. Other states required otherwise eligible black voters to meet literacy and knowledge requirements to the satisfaction of white registrars, who applied subjective judgment and, in the process, rejected most black voters. By 1900, the majority of blacks were literate, but even many of the best-educated of these men continued to \"fail\" the literacy tests administered by white registrars.\n\nThe historian [[J. Morgan Kousser]] noted, \"Within the Democratic party, the chief impetus for restriction came from the black belt members,\" whom he identified as \"always socioeconomically privileged.\" In addition to wanting to affirm white supremacy, the [[planter (American South)|planter]] and business elite were concerned about voting by lower-class and uneducated whites. Kousser found, \"They disfranchised these whites as willingly as they deprived blacks of the vote.\"<ref>J. Morgan Kousser.''The Shaping of Southern Politics: Suffrage Restriction and the Establishment of the One-Party South'', New Haven: Yale University Press, 1974</ref> Perman noted the goals of disenfranchisement resulted from several factors. Competition between white elites and white lower classes, for example, and a desire to prevent alliances between lower-class white and black Americans, as had been seen in Populist-Republican alliances, led white Democratic legislators to restrict voter rolls.<ref name=\"Michael Perman 2001\" />\n\nWith the passage of new constitutions, Southern states adopted provisions that caused disenfranchisement of large portions of their populations by skirting US constitutional protections of the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments. While their voter registration requirements applied to all citizens, in practice they disenfranchised most blacks. As in Alabama, they also \"would remove [from voter registration rolls] the less educated, less organized, more impoverished whites as well \u2013 and that would ensure one-party Democratic rules through most of the 20th century in the South\".<ref name=\"p10\" /><ref name=\"Glenn Feldman 2004, pp. 135\u2013136\">Glenn Feldman, ''The Disfranchisement Myth: Poor Whites and Suffrage Restriction in Alabama'', Athens: University of Georgia Press, 2004, pp.&nbsp;135\u2013136</ref>\n\nThe new provisions of the state constitutions almost entirely eliminated black voting. Although nothing approaching precise data exists, it is estimated that in the late 1930s less than one percent of blacks in the Deep South and around five percent in the Rim South were registered to vote,<ref>Mickey, Robert; ''Paths Out of Dixie: The Democratization of Authoritarian Enclaves in America's Deep South, 1944-1972'', p. 87 {{ISBN|1400838789}}</ref> and that the proportion actually voting even in general elections, which were of no consequence due to complete Democratic dominance, was much smaller still. Secondly, the Democratic legislatures passed [[Jim Crow laws]] to assert white supremacy, establish [[racial segregation]] in public facilities, and treat blacks as second-class citizens. The landmark court decision in ''[[Plessy v. Ferguson]]'' (1896) held that \"separate but equal\" facilities, as on railroad cars, were constitutional. The new constitutions passed numerous Supreme Court challenges. In cases where a particular restriction was overruled by the Supreme Court in the early 20th century, states quickly devised new methods of excluding most blacks from voting, such as the [[white primary]]. Democratic Party primaries became the only competitive contests in southern states.\n\nFor the national Democratic Party, the alignment after Reconstruction resulted in a powerful Southern region that was useful for congressional clout. Nevertheless, prior to President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]], the \"Solid South\" inhibited the national party from fulfilling center-left initiatives{{clarify|date=February 2017}} desired since the days of [[William Jennings Bryan]]. [[Woodrow Wilson#Segregation in the federal government|Woodrow Wilson]], one of two Democrats elected to the presidency between Abraham Lincoln and [[Franklin D.

The literacy test was administered by the voting registrar; in practice, they were white Democrats. Provisions in the constitution also included a [[grandfather clause]], which provided a loophole to enable illiterate whites to register to vote. It said that \"Any citizen who was a voter on January 1, 1867, or his son or grandson, or any person naturalized prior to January 1, 1898, if applying for registration before September 1, 1898, might vote, notwithstanding illiteracy or poverty.\" Separate registration lists were kept for whites and blacks, making it easy for white registrars to discriminate against blacks in literacy tests. The constitution of 1898 also required a person to satisfy a longer [[residency requirement]] in the state, county, parish, and precinct before voting than did the constitution of 1879. This worked against the lower classes, who were more likely to move frequently for work, especially in agricultural areas where there were many migrant workers and sharecroppers.\n\nThe effect of these changes on the population of black voters in Louisiana was devastating; by 1900 black voters were reduced from 130,334 to 5,320 on the rolls. By 1910, only 730 blacks were registered, less than 0.5% of eligible black men. \"In 27 of the state's sixty parishes, not a single black voter was registered any longer; in nine more parishes, only one black voter was.\"<ref name=\"p12\"/>\n\n===North Carolina===\nIn 1894, a coalition of Republicans and the [[Populist Party (United States)|Populist Party]] won control of the North Carolina state legislature (and with it, the ability to elect two US Senators) and were successful in electing several US Representatives elected through [[electoral fusion]].<ref name=\"fusion\">{{cite web|url=http://www.northcarolinahistory.org/encyclopedia/58/entry|title=Fusion Politics - North Carolina History Project|first=Website design and web development by Mango Web Design|last=http://mangowebdesign.com|website=northcarolinahistory.org|accessdate=2 September 2017}}</ref> The fusion coalition made impressive gains in the 1896 election when their legislative majority expanded. Republican [[Daniel Lindsay Russell]] won the gubernatorial race in 1897, the first Republican governor of the state since the end of Reconstruction in 1877. The election also resulted in more than 1,000 elected or appointed black officials, including the election in 1897 of [[George Henry White]] to Congress, as a member of the House of Representatives.\n\nAt the 1898 election, the Democrats ran on [[White Supremacy]] and disenfranchisement in a bitter race-baiting campaign led by [[Furnifold McLendel Simmons]] and [[Josephus Daniels]], editor and publisher of ''[[The News & Observer|The Raleigh News & Observer]].'' The Republican/Populist coalition disintegrated, and the Democrats won the North Carolina 1898 election and the following 1900 election. Simmons was elected as the state's US senator in 1900, holding office until 1931 through multiple re-elections by the state legislature and by popular vote after 1920.\n\nThe Democrats used their power in the state legislature to disenfranchise minorities, primarily blacks, and ensure that Democratic Party and white power would not be threatened again.<ref name=\"shaping\" /><ref name=\"fusion\" /><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lib.unc.edu/ncc/1898/1898.html|title=The North Carolina Election of 1898 \u00b7 UNC Libraries|website=www.lib.unc.edu|accessdate=2 September 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090427010250/http://www.lib.unc.edu/ncc/1898/1898.html|archive-date=27 April 2009|url-status=dead}}</ref> They passed laws restricting voter registration.

The Readjuster Party held control from 1881 to 1883, electing a governor and controlling the legislature, which also elected a US Senator from the state. As in North Carolina, state Democrats were able to divide Readjuster supporters through appeals to White Supremacy. After regaining power, Democrats changed state laws and the constitution in 1902 to disenfranchise blacks. They ratified the new constitution in the legislature and did not submit it to popular vote. Voting in Virginia fell by nearly half as a result of the disenfranchisement of blacks.<ref name=\"historical\"/><ref name = \"Dabney\"/> The eighty-year stretch of white Democratic control ended only in the late 1960s after passage and enforcement of the federal [[Voting Rights Act]] of 1965 and the collapse of the [[Byrd Organization]] machine.\n\n===Border States: failed disenfranchisement===\nThe five [[border states (American Civil War)|border states]] of Delaware, Maryland, West Virginia, Kentucky and Missouri, had legacies similar to the Confederate slave states from the Civil War. The Border States, all slave states, also established laws requiring racial segregation between the 1880s and 1900s; however, disenfranchisement of blacks was never attained to any significant degree. Most Border States did attempt such disenfranchisement during the 1900s.\n\nThe causes of failure to disenfranchise blacks and poor whites in the Border States, as compared to their success for well over half a century in former Confederate states, were complicated. During the 1900s Maryland was vigorously divided between supporters and opponents of disenfranchisement, but it had a large and increasingly educated black community concentrated in Baltimore.

Many states required payment of the tax at a time separate from the election, and then required voters to bring receipts with them to the polls. If they could not locate such receipts, they could not vote. In addition, many states surrounded registration and voting with other complex record-keeping requirements.<ref name=\"Andrews\" /> These were particularly difficult for sharecropper and tenant farmers to comply with, as they moved frequently.\n\nThe poll tax was sometimes used alone or together with a literacy qualification. In a kind of [[grandfather clause]], North Carolina in 1900 exempted from the poll tax those men entitled to vote as of January 1, 1867. This excluded all blacks in the State, who did not have suffrage before that date.<ref name=Pildes />\n\n===Educational and character requirements===\nAlabama, Arkansas, Mississippi, South Carolina and Tennessee, created an educational requirement, with review by a local registrar of a voter's qualifications. In 1898 Georgia rejected such a device.\n\nAlabama delegates at first hesitated, out of concern that illiterate whites would lose their votes.  After the legislature stated that the new constitution would not disenfranchise any white voters and that it would be submitted to the people for ratification, Alabama passed an educational requirement. It was ratified at the polls in November 1901. Its distinctive feature was the \"good character clause\" (also known as the \"[[grandfather clause]]\"). An appointment board in each county could register \"all voters under the present [previous] law\" who were veterans or the lawful descendants of such, and \"all who are of good character and understand the duties and obligations of citizenship\". This gave the board discretion to approve voters on a case-by-case basis. In practice, they enfranchised many whites, but rejected both poor whites and blacks. Most of the latter had been slaves and unable to attain military service.<ref name=\"Andrews\" />\n\nSouth Carolina, Louisiana (1889), and later, Virginia incorporated an educational requirement in their new constitutions. In 1902 Virginia adopted a constitution with the \"understanding\" clause as a literacy test to use until 1904. In addition, application for registration had to be in the applicant's handwriting and written in the presence of the registrar. Thus, someone who could not write, could not vote.<ref name=\"Andrews\" />\n\n===Eight Box Law===\n<!-- linked from [[Jim Crow laws]] (do not change this header--will break the link) -->\nBy 1882, the Democrats were firmly in power in [[South Carolina]]. Republican voters were mostly limited to the majority-black counties of [[Beaufort County, South Carolina|Beaufort]] and [[Georgetown County, South Carolina|Georgetown]]. Because the state had a large black-majority population (nearly sixty percent [[1890 United States Census|in 1890]]),<ref name=rogersJr/> white Democrats had narrow margins in many counties and feared a possible resurgence of black Republican voters at the polls. To remove the black threat, the [[South Carolina General Assembly|General Assembly]] created an indirect literacy test, called the \"Eight Box Law\".\n\nThe law required a separate box for ballots for each office; a voter had to insert the ballot into the corresponding box or it would not count. The ballots could not have party symbols on them. They had to be of a correct size and type of paper. Many ballots were arbitrarily rejected because they slightly deviated from the requirements. Ballots could also randomly be rejected if there were more ballots in a box than registered voters.<ref name=\"Holt\">{{cite book\n  | last =Holt\n  | first =Thomas\n  | authorlink =Thomas C.

On May 8, 1895, Judge Goff of the United States Circuit Court declared the provision unconstitutional and enjoined the state from taking further action under it. But in June 1895, the US Circuit Court of Appeals reversed Judge Goff and dissolved the injunction, leaving the way open for a convention.\n\nThe constitutional convention met on September 10 and adjourned on December 4, 1895. By the new constitution, South Carolina adopted the Mississippi Plan until January 1, 1898. Any male citizen could be registered who was able to read a section of the constitution or to satisfy the election officer that he understood it when read to him. Those thus registered were to remain voters for life. Under the new constitution and application of literacy practices, black voters were dropped in great number from the registration rolls: by 1896, in a state where according to the 1890 census blacks numbered 728,934 and comprised nearly sixty percent of the total population,<ref name=rogersJr>{{cite book | first = George C. and C.

United States]]'' (1915), the Supreme Court invalidated the [[Oklahoma]] [[Oklahoma Constitution|Constitution]]'s \"old soldier\" and \"grandfather clause\" exemptions from literacy tests. In practice, these had disenfranchised blacks, as had occurred in numerous Southern states. This decision affected similar provisions in the constitutions of Alabama, Georgia, Louisiana, North Carolina, and Virginia election rules. Oklahoma and other states quickly reacted by passing laws that created other rules for voter registration that worked against blacks and minorities.<ref>Richard M. Valelly, ''The Two Reconstructions: The Struggle for Black Enfranchisement'', Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 2004, p.141</ref> ''Guinn'' was the first of many cases in which the NAACP filed a brief challenging discriminatory electoral rules.\n\nIn ''[[Lane v. Wilson]]'' (1939), the Supreme Court invalidated an Oklahoma provision designed to disenfranchise blacks. It had replaced the clause struck down in ''Guinn.''  This clause permanently disenfranchised everyone qualified to vote who had not registered to vote in a twelve-day window between April 30 and May 11, 1916, except for those who had voted in 1914. While designed to be more resistant to challenges based on discrimination, as the law did not specifically mention race, the Court struck it down partially because it relied on the 1914 election, when voters had been discriminated against under the rule invalidated in ''Guinn.''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://supreme.justia.com/us/307/268/case.html|title=Lane v.

These became common for all elections. As the Democratic Party was dominant and the only competitive voting was in the primaries, barring minority voters from the primaries was another means of excluding them from politics. Court challenges overturned the white primary system, but many states then passed laws that authorized political  parties to set up the rules for their own systems, such as the white primary. Texas, for instance, passed such a state law in 1923. It was used to bar Mexican Americans as well as black Americans from voting; it survived challenges to the US Supreme Court until the 1940s.<ref>[http://texaspolitics.laits.utexas.edu/6_5_3.html ''Texas Politics: Historical Barriers to Voting''], accessed 11 Apr 2008 {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080402060131/http://texaspolitics.laits.utexas.edu/html/vce/0503.html |date=April 2, 2008 }}</ref>\n\n==Congressional response==\nThe North had heard the South's version of Reconstruction abuses, such as financial corruption, high taxes, and incompetent freedmen. Industry wanted to invest in the South and not worry about political problems. In addition, reconciliation between white veterans of the North and South reached a peak in the early 20th century. As historian [[David Blight]] demonstrated in ''Race and Reunion: The Civil War in American Memory'', reconciliation meant the pushing aside by whites of the major issues of race and suffrage. Southern whites were effective for many years at having their version of history accepted, especially as it was confirmed in ensuing decades by influential historians of the [[Dunning School]] at [[Columbia University]] and other institutions.\n\nDisfranchisement of black Americans in the South was covered by national newspapers and magazines as new laws and constitutions were created, and many Northerners were outraged and alarmed. The [[Lodge Bill]] or Federal Elections Bill or Lodge Force Bill of 1890 was a bill drafted by Representative [[Henry Cabot Lodge]] (R) of Massachusetts, and sponsored in the Senate by [[George Frisbie Hoar]]. It would have authorized federal electors to supervise elections under certain conditions. Due to a Senate filibuster, as well as trade-off of support with Democrats by western [[Silver Republican Party|Silver Republicans]], the bill failed to pass.<ref>Keyssar, Alexander ; ''The Right to Vote: The Contested History of Democracy in the United States'', Basic Books, 2000/2009, p. 86 {{ISBN|0465005020}}</ref><ref>Wendy Hazard, 'Thomas Brackett Reed, Civil Rights, and the Fight for Fair Elections,' '' Maine History'', March 2004, Vol. 42 Issue 1, pp 1\u201323</ref>\n\nIn 1900 the Committee of Census of Congress considered proposals for adding more seats to the House of Representatives because of increased population. Proposals ranged for a total number of seats from 357 to 386. [[Edgar D. Crumpacker]] (R-IN) filed an independent report urging that the Southern states be stripped of seats due to the large numbers of voters they had disfranchised. He noted this was provided for in Section 2 of the Fourteenth Amendment, which provided for stripping representation from states that reduced suffrage due to race.<ref name=\"valelly146-147\"/> The Committee and House failed to agree on this proposal.<ref name=\"committee\"/> Supporters of black suffrage worked to secure Congressional investigation of disfranchisement, but concerted opposition of the Southern Democratic bloc was aroused, and the efforts failed.<ref name=\"Andrews\" />\n\nFrom 1896 to 1900, the House of Representatives with a Republican majority had acted in more than thirty cases to set aside election results from Southern states where the House Elections Committee had concluded that \"black voters had been excluded due to fraud, violence, or intimidation.\" Nevertheless, in the early 20th century, it began to back off from its enforcement of the Fifteenth Amendment and suggested that state and federal courts should exercise oversight of this issue.

Because they were disfranchised, blacks could not serve on juries, and whites were clearly aligned against them on this and other racial issues.\n\n{{anchor|Tinkham}}\nDespite the Lever decision and domination of Congress by Democrats, some Northern Congressmen continued to raise the issue of black disfranchisement and resulting malapportionment. For instance, on December 6, 1920, Representative [[George H. Tinkham]] (R-MA) offered a resolution for the Committee of Census to investigate alleged disfranchisement of blacks. His intention was to enforce the provisions of the Fourteenth and Fifteenth amendments.<ref name=\"tinkham\"/>\n\nIn addition, he believed there should be reapportionment in the House related to the voting population of southern states, rather than the general population as enumerated in the census.<ref name=\"tinkham\"/> Such reapportionment was authorized by the Constitution and would reflect reality, so that the South should not get credit for people and voters it had disfranchised.

[https://www.jstor.org/stable/273560 in JSTOR]</ref>  The NAACP lobbied for commissioning of African Americans as officers in World War I. It was arranged for W.E.B. Du Bois to receive an Army commission, but he failed his physical.  In 1915 the NAACP organized public education and protests in cities across the nation against D.W. Griffith's film ''[[Birth of a Nation]]'', a film that glamorized the Ku Klux Klan and shown in the Wilson White House as a personal favor to its author, a college roommate of President Wilson.  Boston and a few other cities refused to allow the film to open.\n\n==Legislative and cultural effects==\n===20th-century Supreme Court decisions===\nBlack Americans and their allies worked hard to regain their ability to exercise the constitutional rights of citizens. [[Booker T. Washington]], widely known for his accommodationist approach as the leader of the [[Tuskegee Institute]], called on northern backers to help finance legal challenges to disenfranchisement and segregation. He raised substantial funds and also arranged for representation on some cases, such as the two for Giles in Alabama. He challenged the state's grandfather clause and a citizenship test required for new voters, which was administered in a discriminatory way against blacks.<ref>[http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=224731 Richard H.

Harris]]'' (1903), the [[United States Supreme Court]] under Justice [[Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr.]] effectively upheld such southern voter registration provisions in dealing with a challenge to the Alabama constitution. Its decision said the provisions were not targeted at blacks and thus did not deprive them of rights. This has been characterized as the \"most momentous ignored decision\" in constitutional history.<ref>[http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=224731 Richard H. Pildes, 'Democracy, Anti-Democracy, and the Canon', ''Constitutional Commentary'', Vol. 17, 2000, p.32] Accessed 10 Mar 2008</ref>\n\nTrying to deal with the grounds of the Court's ruling, Giles mounted another challenge. In ''[[Giles v. Teasley]]'' (1904), the U.S. Supreme Court upheld Alabama's disenfranchising constitution. That same year the Congress refused to overturn a disputed election, and essentially sent plaintiffs back to the state courts. Even when black plaintiffs gained rulings in their favor from the Supreme Court, states quickly devised alternative ways to exclude them from the political process. It was not until later in the 20th century that such legal challenges on disenfranchisement began to meet more success in the courts.\n\nWith the founding of the [[National Association for the Advancement of Colored People]] (NAACP) in 1909, the interracial group based in New York began to provide financial and strategic support to lawsuits on voting issues. What became the [[NAACP Legal Defense Fund]] organized and mounted numerous cases in repeated court and legal challenges to the many barriers of segregation, including disenfranchisement provisions of the states. The NAACP often represented plaintiffs directly, or helped raise funds to support legal challenges. The NAACP also worked at public education, lobbying of Congress, demonstrations, and encouragement of theater and academic writing as other means to reach the public. NAACP chapters were organized in cities across the country, and membership increased rapidly in the South. The [[American Civil Liberties Union]] also represented plaintiffs in some disenfranchisement cases.\n\n===Successful challenges===\nIn ''[[Smith v. Allwright]]'' (1944), the Supreme Court reviewed a Texas case and ruled against the [[white primary]]; the state legislature had authorized the Democratic Party to devise its own rules of operation. The 1944 court ruling was that this was unconstitutional, as the state had failed to protect the constitutional rights of its citizens.\n\nFollowing the 1944 ruling, civil rights organizations in major cities moved quickly to register black voters. For instance, in Georgia, in 1940 only 20,000 blacks had managed to register to vote. After the Supreme Court decision, the All-Citizens Registration Committee (ACRC) of Atlanta started organizing. By 1947 they and others had succeeded in getting 125,000 black Americans registered, 18.8% of those of eligible age.<ref>Chandler Davidson and Bernard Grofman, ''Quiet Revolution in the South: The Impact of the Voting Rights Act'', Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1994, p.70</ref>\n\nEach legal victory was followed by white-dominated legislatures' renewed efforts to control black voting through different exclusionary schemes. In the 1940s, Alabama passed a law to give white registrars more discretion in testing applicants for comprehension and literacy. In 1958 Georgia passed a new voter registration act that required those who were illiterate to satisfy \"understanding tests\" by correctly answering 20 of 30 questions related to citizenship posed by the voting registrar. Blacks had made substantial advances in education, but the individual white registrars were the sole persons to determine whether individual prospective voters answered correctly. In practice, registrars disqualified most black voters, whether they were educated or not. In Terrell County, for instance, which was 64% black in population, after passage of the act, only 48 black Americans were able to register to vote in 1958.<ref>Davidson and Grofman (1994), ''Quiet Revolution in the South'', p. 71</ref>\n\n==Civil Rights Movement==\n{{Main|Civil Rights Movement}}\nThe NAACP's steady progress with individual cases was thwarted by southern Democrats' continuing resistance and passage of new statutory barriers to blacks' exercising the franchise. Through the 1950s and 1960s, private citizens enlarged the effort by becoming activists throughout the South, led by many black churches and their leaders, and joined by both young and older activists from northern states. Nonviolent confrontation and demonstrations were mounted in numerous Southern cities, often provoking violent reaction by white bystanders and authorities. The moral crusade of the [[Civil Rights Movement]] gained national media coverage, attention across the country, and a growing national demand for change.\n\nWidespread violence against the [[Freedom Riders]] in 1961, which was covered by television and newspapers, the murders of activists in Alabama in 1963 gained support for the activists' cause at the national level. President [[John F. Kennedy]] introduced civil rights legislation to Congress in 1963 before he was assassinated.\n\nPresident [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] took up the charge. In January 1964, Johnson met with civil rights leaders. On January 8, during his first [[State of the Union (USA)|State of the Union address]], Johnson asked Congress to \"let this session of Congress be known as the session which did more for civil rights than the last hundred sessions combined.\" On January 23, 1964, the [[Twenty-fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution|24th Amendment]] to the U.S. Constitution, prohibiting the use of [[poll tax (United States)|poll taxes]] in national elections, was ratified with the approval of [[South Dakota]], the 38th state to do so.\n\nOn June 21, 1964, civil rights workers [[Michael Schwerner]], [[Andrew Goodman (activist)|Andrew Goodman]], and [[James Chaney]], disappeared in [[Neshoba County, Mississippi]]. The three were volunteers aiding in the registration of black voters as part of the [[Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party|Mississippi Freedom Summer Project]]. Forty-four days later the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] recovered their bodies from an earthen dam where they were buried. The Neshoba County deputy sheriff Cecil Price and 16 others, all [[Ku Klux Klan]] members, were indicted for the murders; seven were convicted. The investigation also revealed the bodies of several black men, whose deaths had never been revealed or prosecuted by white law enforcement officials.\n\nWhen the Civil Rights Bill came before the full Senate for debate on March 30, 1964, the \"Southern Bloc\" of 18 southern Democratic Senators and one Republican Senator, led by [[Richard Russell, Jr.|Richard Russell]] (D-GA), launched a [[filibuster]] to prevent its passage.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.congresslink.org/print_basics_histmats_civilrights64text.htm |title=Major Features of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 |publisher=Congresslink.org |accessdate=2010-06-06 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141206191323/http://www.congresslink.org/print_basics_histmats_civilrights64text.htm |archivedate=2014-12-06 }}</ref> Russell said:\n\n{{quote|We will resist to the bitter end any measure or any movement which would have a tendency to bring about [[social equality]] and [[miscegenation|intermingling and amalgamation of the races]] in our (Southern) states.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://spartacus-educational.com/USAcivil64.htm |title=Civil Rights Act of 1964 |publisher=Spartacus-Educational.com |accessdate=2019-02-27 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100516142923/http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/USAcivil64.htm |archivedate=2010-05-16 }}</ref>}}\n\nAfter 57 working days of filibuster, and several compromises, the Senate had enough votes (71 to 29) to end the debate and the filibuster. It was the first time that Southern senators had failed to win with such tactics against civil rights bills. On July 2, President Johnson signed into law the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]].<ref>{{cite web\n |title       = Civil Rights during the administration of Lyndon B.

It did not explicitly ban [[literacy tests]], which had been used to disqualify blacks and poor white voters.\n\nAs the [[United States Department of Justice]] has stated:\n\n<blockquote>By 1965 concerted efforts to break the grip of state disenfranchisement (sic) had been under way for some time, but had achieved only modest success overall and in some areas had proved almost entirely ineffectual. The murder of voting-rights activists in [[Philadelphia, Mississippi]], gained national attention, along with numerous other acts of violence and terrorism. Finally, the unprovoked attack on March 7, 1965, by state troopers on peaceful marchers crossing the [[Edmund Pettus Bridge]] in [[Selma, Alabama]], en route to the state capitol in [[Montgomery, Alabama|Montgomery]], persuaded the President and Congress to overcome Southern legislators' resistance to effective voting rights legislation. President Johnson issued a call for a strong voting rights law and hearings began soon thereafter on the bill that would become the [[Voting Rights Act]].<ref>{{cite web\n |title       = Introduction To Federal Voting Rights Laws\n |url         = http://www.usdoj.gov/crt/voting/intro/intro_b.htm\n |publisher   = United States Department of Justice\n |accessdate  = 2007-02-25\n |url-status     = dead\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20070304111738/http://www.usdoj.gov/crt/voting/intro/intro_b.htm\n |archivedate = 2007-03-04\n}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nPassed in 1965, this law prohibited the use of literacy tests as a requirement to register to vote. It provided for recourse for local voters to federal oversight and intervention, plus federal monitoring of areas that historically had low voter turnouts to ensure that new measures were not taken against minority voters. It provided for federal enforcement of voting rights. African Americans began to enter the formal political process, most in the South for the first time in their lives. They have since won numerous seats and offices at local, state and federal levels.\n\n==See also==\n* [[African-American history]]\n* [[Civil rights movement (1865\u20131896)]]\n* [[Civil rights movement (1896\u20131954)]]\n* [[List of 19th-century African-American civil rights activists]]\n* [[Timeline of the civil rights movement]]\n* [[Felony disenfranchisement]]\n* [[Jim Crow laws]]\n* [[Nadir of American race relations]]\n* [[Judicial aspects of race in the United States]]\n* [[Voting rights in the United States]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist| group=\"nb\"}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* Grantham, Dewey W.

All models feature a [[Broadcom]] [[system on a chip]] (SoC) with an integrated [[ARM architecture|ARM]]-compatible [[central processing unit]] (CPU) and [[graphics processing unit#Integrated graphics|on-chip graphics processing unit]] (GPU).\n\nProcessor speed ranges from 700&nbsp;MHz to 1.4&nbsp;GHz for the Pi&nbsp;3 Model B+ or 1.5&nbsp;GHz for the Pi 4; on-board memory ranges from 256&nbsp;[[mebibyte|MiB]] to 1&nbsp;[[gibibyte|GiB]] [[random-access memory]] (RAM), with up to 4&nbsp;GiB available on the Pi 4.  [[Secure&nbsp;Digital]] (SD) cards in MicroSDHC form factor (SDHC on early models) are used to store the operating system and program memory.  The boards have one to five [[USB]] ports.  For video output, [[HDMI]] and [[composite video]] are supported, with a standard 3.5&nbsp;mm [[phone connector (audio)|tip-ring-sleeve]] jack for audio output.  Lower-level output is provided by a number of [[General-purpose input/output|GPIO]] pins, which support common protocols like [[I\u00b2C]].  The B-models have an [[8P8C]] [[Ethernet]] port and the Pi&nbsp;3, Pi&nbsp;4 and Pi Zero&nbsp;W have on-board [[Wi-Fi]] [[802.11n]] and [[Bluetooth]].  Prices range from US$5 to $55.\n\nThe first generation ('''Raspberry Pi&nbsp;1 Model&nbsp;B''') was released in February 2012, followed by the simpler and cheaper '''Model&nbsp;A'''.  In 2014, the Foundation released a board with an improved design, '''Raspberry Pi&nbsp;1 Model&nbsp;B+'''.  These boards are approximately credit-card sized and represent the standard ''mainline'' form-factor. Improved A+ and B+ models were released a year later. A [[#Compute module|\"Compute Module\"]] was released in April 2014 for [[embedded system|embedded applications]]. The '''Raspberry Pi&nbsp;2''', which added more RAM, was released in February 2015.\n\nA '''Raspberry Pi&nbsp;Zero''' with smaller size and reduced [[input/output]] (I/O) and [[general-purpose input/output]] (GPIO) capabilities was released in November 2015 for US$5.

The Ethernet adapter is internally connected to an additional USB port. In Model&nbsp;A, A+, and the Pi&nbsp;Zero, the USB port is connected directly to the [[system on a chip]] (SoC). On the Pi&nbsp;1 Model&nbsp;B+ and later models the USB/Ethernet chip contains a five-port USB hub, of which four ports are available, while the Pi&nbsp;1 Model&nbsp;B only provides two.

There are reports the Raspberry Pi&nbsp;2 can be similarly overclocked, in extreme cases, even to 1500&nbsp;MHz (discarding all safety features and over-voltage limitations). In the [[#Software|Raspbian]] [[Linux distro]] the overclocking options on [[booting|boot]] can be done by a software command running \"sudo raspi-config\" without voiding the warranty.<ref name=\"Turbo mode\"/>  In those cases the Pi automatically shuts the overclocking down if the chip [[temperature]] reaches {{convert|85|C|F}}, but it is possible to override automatic over-voltage and overclocking settings (voiding the warranty); an appropriately sized [[heat sink]] is needed to protect the chip from serious [[Overheating (electricity)|overheating]].\n\nNewer versions of the [[firmware]] contain the option to choose between five overclock (\"turbo\") presets that when used, attempt to maximise the performance of the SoC without impairing the lifetime of the board.  This is done by monitoring the core temperature of the chip and the [[Load (computing)|CPU load]], and dynamically adjusting [[Clock rate|clock speeds]] and the [[CPU core voltage|core voltage]].  When the demand is low on the CPU or it is running too hot the performance is [[Throttling process (computing)|throttled]], but if the CPU has much to do and the chip's temperature is acceptable, performance is temporarily increased with clock speeds of up to 1&nbsp;GHz, depending on the board version and on which of the turbo settings is used.\n\nThe seven overclock presets are:\n\n* none; 700&nbsp;MHz ARM, 250&nbsp;MHz core, 400&nbsp;MHz SDRAM, 0 [[overvolting]]\n* modest; 800&nbsp;MHz ARM, 250&nbsp;MHz core, 400&nbsp;MHz SDRAM, 0 overvolting,\n* medium; 900&nbsp;MHz ARM, 250&nbsp;MHz core, 450&nbsp;MHz SDRAM, 2 overvolting,\n* high; 950&nbsp;MHz ARM, 250&nbsp;MHz core, 450&nbsp;MHz SDRAM, 6 overvolting,\n* turbo; 1000&nbsp;MHz ARM, 500&nbsp;MHz core, 600&nbsp;MHz SDRAM, 6 overvolting,\n* Pi&nbsp;2; 1000&nbsp;MHz ARM, 500&nbsp;MHz core, 500&nbsp;MHz SDRAM, 2 overvolting,\n* Pi&nbsp;3; 1100&nbsp;MHz ARM, 550&nbsp;MHz core, 500&nbsp;MHz SDRAM, 6 overvolting. In system information the CPU speed will appear as 1200&nbsp;MHz. When idling, speed lowers to 600&nbsp;MHz.<ref name=\"Turbo mode\">{{cite web|title=Introducing turbo mode: up to 50% more performance for free| url=http://www.raspberrypi.org/introducing-turbo-mode-up-to-50-more-performance-for-free/ | publisher=Raspberrypi.org| accessdate=20 September 2012}}</ref><ref name=\"turbosgithub\">{{cite web|url=https://github.com/asb/raspi-config/blob/master/raspi-config|title=asb/raspi-config on Github| publisher=asb|accessdate=11 May 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn the highest (''turbo'') preset the SDRAM clock was originally 500&nbsp;MHz, but this was later changed to 600&nbsp;MHz because 500&nbsp;MHz sometimes causes SD card corruption. Simultaneously in ''high'' mode the core clock speed was lowered from 450 to 250&nbsp;MHz, and in ''medium'' mode from 333 to 250&nbsp;MHz.\n\nThe CPU on the first and second generation Raspberry Pi board did not require cooling, such as a heat sink or [[Computer fan|fan]], even when overclocked, but the Raspberry Pi&nbsp;3 may generate more heat when overclocked.<ref>[https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/configuration/config-txt/overclocking.md] Overclocking options \u2013 raspberrypi.org</ref>\n\n=== RAM ===\nThe early designs of the Raspberry Pi Model A and B boards included only 256&nbsp;MiB of [[random access memory]] (RAM).

However, other bright lights, particularly ones that are on continuously, were found to have no effect. The symptom was the Raspberry Pi&nbsp;2 spontaneously rebooting or turning off when these lights were flashed at the chip. Initially, some users and commenters suspected that the [[electromagnetic pulse]] (EMP) from the xenon flash tube was causing the problem by interfering with the computer's digital circuitry, but this was ruled out by tests where the light was either blocked by a card or aimed at the other side of the Raspberry Pi&nbsp;2, both of which did not cause a problem. The problem was narrowed down to the U16 chip by covering first the [[system on a chip]] (main processor) and then U16 with [[Blu-Tack]] (an opaque poster mounting compound). Light being the sole culprit, instead of EMP, was further confirmed by the laser pointer tests,<ref name=\"U16 Hackaday\" /> where it was also found that less opaque covering was needed to shield against the laser pointers than to shield against the xenon flashes.<ref name=\"U16 forums\" /> The U16 chip seems to be bare silicon without a plastic cover (i.e. a [[chip-scale package]] or [[wafer-level package]]), which would, if present, block the light. Unofficial workarounds include covering U16 with opaque material (such as electrical tape,<ref name=\"U16 forums\" /><ref name=\"U16 Hackaday\" /> lacquer, poster mounting compound, or even balled-up bread<ref name=\"U16 forums\" />), putting the Raspberry Pi&nbsp;2 in a case,<ref name=\"U16 Hackaday\" /> and avoiding taking photos of the top side of the board with a xenon flash.

All models feature a [[Broadcom]] [[system on a chip]] (SoC) with an integrated [[ARM architecture|ARM]]-compatible [[central processing unit]] (CPU) and [[graphics processing unit#Integrated graphics|on-chip graphics processing unit]] (GPU).\n\nProcessor speed ranges from 700&nbsp;MHz to 1.4&nbsp;GHz for the Pi&nbsp;3 Model B+ or 1.5&nbsp;GHz for the Pi 4; on-board memory ranges from 256&nbsp;[[mebibyte|MiB]] to 1&nbsp;[[gibibyte|GiB]] [[random-access memory]] (RAM), with up to 4&nbsp;GiB available on the Pi 4.  [[Secure&nbsp;Digital]] (SD) cards in MicroSDHC form factor (SDHC on early models) are used to store the operating system and program memory.  The boards have one to five [[USB]] ports.  For video output, [[HDMI]] and [[composite video]] are supported, with a standard 3.5&nbsp;mm [[phone connector (audio)|tip-ring-sleeve]] jack for audio output.  Lower-level output is provided by a number of [[General-purpose input/output|GPIO]] pins, which support common protocols like [[I\u00b2C]].  The B-models have an [[8P8C]] [[Ethernet]] port and the Pi&nbsp;3, Pi&nbsp;4 and Pi Zero&nbsp;W have on-board [[Wi-Fi]] [[802.11n]] and [[Bluetooth]].  Prices range from US$5 to $55.\n\nThe first generation ('''Raspberry Pi&nbsp;1 Model&nbsp;B''') was released in February 2012, followed by the simpler and cheaper '''Model&nbsp;A'''.  In 2014, the Foundation released a board with an improved design, '''Raspberry Pi&nbsp;1 Model&nbsp;B+'''.  These boards are approximately credit-card sized and represent the standard ''mainline'' form-factor. Improved A+ and B+ models were released a year later.

There are reports the Raspberry Pi&nbsp;2 can be similarly overclocked, in extreme cases, even to 1500&nbsp;MHz (discarding all safety features and over-voltage limitations). In the [[#Software|Raspbian]] [[Linux distro]] the overclocking options on [[booting|boot]] can be done by a software command running \"sudo raspi-config\" without voiding the warranty.<ref name=\"Turbo mode\"/>  In those cases the Pi automatically shuts the overclocking down if the chip [[temperature]] reaches {{convert|85|C|F}}, but it is possible to override automatic over-voltage and overclocking settings (voiding the warranty); an appropriately sized [[heat sink]] is needed to protect the chip from serious [[Overheating (electricity)|overheating]].\n\nNewer versions of the [[firmware]] contain the option to choose between five overclock (\"turbo\") presets that when used, attempt to maximise the performance of the SoC without impairing the lifetime of the board.  This is done by monitoring the core temperature of the chip and the [[Load (computing)|CPU load]], and dynamically adjusting [[Clock rate|clock speeds]] and the [[CPU core voltage|core voltage]].  When the demand is low on the CPU or it is running too hot the performance is [[Throttling process (computing)|throttled]], but if the CPU has much to do and the chip's temperature is acceptable, performance is temporarily increased with clock speeds of up to 1&nbsp;GHz, depending on the board version and on which of the turbo settings is used.\n\nThe seven overclock presets are:\n\n* none; 700&nbsp;MHz ARM, 250&nbsp;MHz core, 400&nbsp;MHz SDRAM, 0 [[overvolting]]\n* modest; 800&nbsp;MHz ARM, 250&nbsp;MHz core, 400&nbsp;MHz SDRAM, 0 overvolting,\n* medium; 900&nbsp;MHz ARM, 250&nbsp;MHz core, 450&nbsp;MHz SDRAM, 2 overvolting,\n* high; 950&nbsp;MHz ARM, 250&nbsp;MHz core, 450&nbsp;MHz SDRAM, 6 overvolting,\n* turbo; 1000&nbsp;MHz ARM, 500&nbsp;MHz core, 600&nbsp;MHz SDRAM, 6 overvolting,\n* Pi&nbsp;2; 1000&nbsp;MHz ARM, 500&nbsp;MHz core, 500&nbsp;MHz SDRAM, 2 overvolting,\n* Pi&nbsp;3; 1100&nbsp;MHz ARM, 550&nbsp;MHz core, 500&nbsp;MHz SDRAM, 6 overvolting. In system information the CPU speed will appear as 1200&nbsp;MHz. When idling, speed lowers to 600&nbsp;MHz.<ref name=\"Turbo mode\">{{cite web|title=Introducing turbo mode: up to 50% more performance for free| url=http://www.raspberrypi.org/introducing-turbo-mode-up-to-50-more-performance-for-free/ | publisher=Raspberrypi.org| accessdate=20 September 2012}}</ref><ref name=\"turbosgithub\">{{cite web|url=https://github.com/asb/raspi-config/blob/master/raspi-config|title=asb/raspi-config on Github| publisher=asb|accessdate=11 May 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn the highest (''turbo'') preset the SDRAM clock was originally 500&nbsp;MHz, but this was later changed to 600&nbsp;MHz because 500&nbsp;MHz sometimes causes SD card corruption. Simultaneously in ''high'' mode the core clock speed was lowered from 450 to 250&nbsp;MHz, and in ''medium'' mode from 333 to 250&nbsp;MHz.\n\nThe CPU on the first and second generation Raspberry Pi board did not require cooling, such as a heat sink or [[Computer fan|fan]], even when overclocked, but the Raspberry Pi&nbsp;3 may generate more heat when overclocked.<ref>[https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/configuration/config-txt/overclocking.md] Overclocking options \u2013 raspberrypi.org</ref>\n\n=== RAM ===\nThe early designs of the Raspberry Pi Model A and B boards included only 256&nbsp;MiB of [[random access memory]] (RAM). Of this, the early beta Model&nbsp;B boards allocated 128&nbsp;MiB to the GPU by default, leaving only 128&nbsp;MiB for the CPU.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/comments/oicyr/i_have_a_raspberry_pi_beta_board_ama/c3hj3n0 |title=I have a Raspberry Pi Beta Board AMA |website=reddit.com |date=15 January 2012 |accessdate=6 May 2012}}</ref> On the early 256&nbsp;MiB releases of models A and B, three different splits were possible. The default split was 192&nbsp;MiB for the CPU, which should be sufficient for standalone 1080p video decoding, or for simple 3D processing. 224&nbsp;MiB was for Linux processing only, with only a 1080p [[framebuffer]], and was likely to fail for any video or 3D. 128&nbsp;MiB was for heavy 3D processing, possibly also with video decoding.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.raspberrypi.org/forum/general-discussion/config-txt/page-3|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120316062124/http://www.raspberrypi.org/forum/general-discussion/config-txt/page-3|url-status=dead|title=Raspberry Pi boot configuration text file|website=raspberrypi.org|archive-date=16 March 2012}}</ref> In comparison, the [[Nokia 701]] uses 128&nbsp;MiB for the Broadcom VideoCore IV.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.raspberrypi.org/forum/general-discussion/nokia-701-has-a-similar-broadcom-gpu |title=Nokia 701 has a similar Broadcom GPU |website=raspberrypi.org |date=2 February 2012 |accessdate=22 June 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120205011054/http://www.raspberrypi.org/forum/general-discussion/nokia-701-has-a-similar-broadcom-gpu |archivedate=5 February 2012  }}</ref>\n\nThe later Model&nbsp;B with 512&nbsp;MiB RAM, was initially released with new standard memory split files (arm256_start.elf, arm384_start.elf, arm496_start.elf) with 256&nbsp;MiB, 384&nbsp;MiB, and 496&nbsp;MiB CPU RAM, and with 256&nbsp;MiB, 128&nbsp;MiB, and 16&nbsp;MiB video RAM, respectively.

It can be configured in multiple ways, for example to show up as a serial device or an ethernet device.<ref name=\"adafruitgadget\">{{Cite web|url=https://learn.adafruit.com/turning-your-raspberry-pi-zero-into-a-usb-gadget/overview|title=Turning your Raspberry PI Zero into a USB Gadget|website=Adafruit Learning System}}</ref>  Although originally requiring software patches, this was added into the mainline Raspbian distribution in May 2016.<ref name=\"adafruitgadget\"/>\n\nThe Pi 3 can boot from USB, such as from a flash drive.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/hardware/raspberrypi/bootmodes/msd.md|title=USB mass storage device boot - Raspberry Pi Documentation|website=raspberrypi.org}}</ref> Because of firmware limitations in other models, the Pi 2B v1.2, 3A+, 3B, and 3B+ are the only boards that can do this.\n\n=== Peripherals ===\n[[File:Raspberry-Pi-2-Bare-FL.jpg|thumb|right|The Model&nbsp;2B boards incorporate four USB ports for connecting peripherals.]]\nAlthough often pre-configured to operate as a [[headless computer]], the Raspberry Pi may also optionally be operated with any generic [[USB computer keyboard]] and [[Computer mouse|mouse]].<ref name=\"VerifiedPeripheralList\"/> It may also be used with USB storage, USB to MIDI converters, and ''virtually'' any other device/component with USB capabilities, depending on the installed device drivers in the underlying operating system (many of which are included by default).\n\nOther peripherals can be attached through the various pins and connectors on the surface of the Raspberry Pi.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/usage/gpio/README.md|title=GPIO \u2013 Raspberry Pi Documentation|website=raspberrypi.org|access-date=2 June 2019}}</ref>\n\n=== Video ===\n[[File:Raspberry Pi - Model A.jpg|thumb|The early Raspberry Pi&nbsp;1 Model A, with an HDMI port and a standard RCA composite video port for older displays]]\nThe video controller can generate standard modern TV resolutions, such as HD and [[Full HD]], and higher or lower monitor resolutions as well as older NTSC or PAL standard [[Cathode-ray tube|CRT]] TV resolutions.

However, other bright lights, particularly ones that are on continuously, were found to have no effect. The symptom was the Raspberry Pi&nbsp;2 spontaneously rebooting or turning off when these lights were flashed at the chip. Initially, some users and commenters suspected that the [[electromagnetic pulse]] (EMP) from the xenon flash tube was causing the problem by interfering with the computer's digital circuitry, but this was ruled out by tests where the light was either blocked by a card or aimed at the other side of the Raspberry Pi&nbsp;2, both of which did not cause a problem. The problem was narrowed down to the U16 chip by covering first the [[system on a chip]] (main processor) and then U16 with [[Blu-Tack]] (an opaque poster mounting compound). Light being the sole culprit, instead of EMP, was further confirmed by the laser pointer tests,<ref name=\"U16 Hackaday\" /> where it was also found that less opaque covering was needed to shield against the laser pointers than to shield against the xenon flashes.<ref name=\"U16 forums\" /> The U16 chip seems to be bare silicon without a plastic cover (i.e. a [[chip-scale package]] or [[wafer-level package]]), which would, if present, block the light. Unofficial workarounds include covering U16 with opaque material (such as electrical tape,<ref name=\"U16 forums\" /><ref name=\"U16 Hackaday\" /> lacquer, poster mounting compound, or even balled-up bread<ref name=\"U16 forums\" />), putting the Raspberry Pi&nbsp;2 in a case,<ref name=\"U16 Hackaday\" /> and avoiding taking photos of the top side of the board with a xenon flash. This issue was not discovered before the release of the Raspberry Pi&nbsp;2 because it is not standard or common practice to test susceptibility to optical interference,<ref name=\"U16 forums\" /> while commercial electronic devices are routinely subjected to tests of susceptibility to radio interference.\n\n==Reception and use==\n[[File:NASAJPLOpenSourceRover.webp|thumb|NASA's ''Open Source Rover'' powered by a Raspberry Pi 3]]\nTechnology writer [[Glyn Moody]] described the project in May 2011 as a \"potential {{nowrap|[[BBC Micro]] 2.0}}\", not by replacing {{nowrap|[[PC compatible]]}} machines but by supplementing them.<ref name=\"computerworlduk as british\">{{cite web |url=http://blogs.computerworlduk.com/open-enterprise/2011/05/as-british-as-raspberry-pi |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130102155751/http://blogs.computerworlduk.com/open-enterprise/2011/05/as-british-as-raspberry-pi |url-status=dead |archive-date=2 January 2013 |title=As British as Raspberry Pi? |work=Computerworld UK Open Enterprise blog |date=9 May 2011 |accessdate=2 February 2012 |author=Moody Glyn |authorlink=Glyn Moody }}</ref> In March 2012 Stephen Pritchard echoed the BBC Micro successor sentiment in ''ITPRO''.<ref name=\"itpro bbc 2012\">{{cite news |url=http://www.itpro.co.uk/639292/raspberry-pi-a-bbc-micro-for-todays-generation |title=Raspberry Pi: A BBC Micro for today's generation |work=ITPRO |date=1 March 2012 |accessdate=15 March 2012 |author=Pritchard, Stephen}}</ref> Alex Hope, co-author of the Next Gen report, is hopeful that the computer will engage children with the excitement of programming.<ref name=\"telegraph\">{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/video-games/8931387/Computing-classes-dont-teach-programming-skills.html |title=Computing classes don't teach programming skills |work=The Daily Telegraph  |date=3 December 2011 |accessdate=27 February 2012 |author=Stanford, Peter |location=London}}</ref> Co-author [[Ian Livingstone]] suggested that the [[BBC]] could be involved in building support for the device, possibly branding it as the BBC Nano.<ref name=\"bbc classroom coders\">{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-16424990 |title=Raspberry Pi bids for success with classroom coders |work=BBC News|date=10 January 2012 |accessdate=29 February 2012 |author=Vallance, Chris}}</ref> [[The Centre for Computing History]] strongly supports the Raspberry Pi project, feeling that it could \"usher in a new era\".<ref name=\"computinghistory donated\" /> Before release, the board was showcased by [[ARM Holdings|ARM's]] CEO [[Warren East]] at an event in Cambridge outlining Google's ideas to improve UK science and technology education.<ref name=\"cabume improve stem teaching\">{{cite news |url=http://www.cabume.co.uk/the-cluster/how-google-can-really-help-improve-stem-teaching-in-the-uk.html |title=How Google can really help improve STEM teaching in the UK |work=Cabume |date=23 February 2012 |accessdate=28 February 2012 |author=Osborn, George}}</ref>\n\nHarry Fairhead, however, suggests that more emphasis should be put on improving the educational software available on existing hardware, using tools such as [[Google App Inventor]] to return programming to schools, rather than adding new hardware choices.<ref name=\"Raspberry Pi or Programming\">{{cite news |url=http://www.i-programmer.info/professional-programmer/i-programmer/3419-raspberry-pi-or-programming.html |title=Raspberry Pi or Programming \u2013 What shall we teach the children? |work=I Programmer |date=2 December 2011 |accessdate=7 February 2012 |author=Fairhead, Harry}}</ref> Simon Rockman, writing in a ''[[ZDNet]]'' blog, was of the opinion that teens will have \"better things to do\", despite what happened in the 1980s.<ref name=\"zdnet mid-life crisis\">{{cite news |url=http://www.zdnet.com/article/is-raspberry-pi-a-mid-life-crisis/ |title=Is raspberry pi a mid-life crisis? |publisher=[[ZDNet]] |date=21 February 2012 |accessdate=24 February 2012 |author=Rockman, Simon |quote=Just because young teens led the way in computing in the 1980s doesn't mean it should, will or can happen again.

The design allows the use of the Compute Module in harsh industrial environments, leading to the conclusion that the Raspberry Pi is no longer limited to home and science projects, but can be widely used as an [[Internet of things|Industrial IoT]] solution and achieve goals of [[Industry 4.0]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://linuxgizmos.com/automation-controller-taps-raspberry-pi-compute-module/ |title=Automation controller taps Raspberry Pi Compute Module|date=25 June 2014|work=LinuxGizmos.com|access-date=10 March 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn March 2018, SUSE announced commercial support for SUSE Linux Enterprise on the Raspberry Pi 3 Model B to support a number of undisclosed customers implementing industrial monitoring with the Raspberry Pi.<ref>https://www.suse.com/c/small-server-big-companies-new-raspberry-pi-support-sles-arm/ A small server for big businesses</ref>\n\n===Commercial products===\nOTTO is a digital camera created by Next Thing Co.

The Astro Pis are augmented Raspberry Pis and included Sensor Hats and either a visible-light Raspberry Pi camera or an infrared raspberry Pi camera. The Astro Pi competition, called Principia. was officially opened in January and was opened to all primary and secondary school aged children who were residents of the United Kingdom. During his mission, British ESA astronaut [[Tim Peake]] deployed the computers on board the [[International Space Station]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/watch-tim-peake-astro-pi-flight-units-in-space/|title=Watch Tim Peake with the Astro Pi flight units in space!|date=7 March 2016|publisher= Raspberry Pi Foundation}}</ref> He loaded the winning code while in orbit, collected the data generated and then sent this to Earth where it was distributed to the winning teams. Covered themes during the competition included spacecraft sensors, satellite imaging, space measurements, data fusion and space radiation.\n\nThe organisations involved in the Astro Pi competition include the [[UK Space Agency]], UKspace, Raspberry Pi, ESERO-UK and [[ESA]].\n\nIn 2017, the European Space Agency ran another competition open to all students in the European Union called Proxima.
