He was a first cousin six times removed of [[Benjamin Franklin]] and a nephew of [[J. A. Folger]], the founder of [[Folgers|Folger Coffee]]. He is descendant of [[Peter Foulger]] and [[Mary Morrill|Mary ''Morrill'' Foulger]].\n\nHe prepared at [[Adelphi Academy]], [[Brooklyn]], New York, where he was acquainted with [[Charles Pratt]], the businessman and president of the Adelphi board of trustees who became a mentor to Folger. At Adelphi, Folger was schooled in art, chemistry, classics, and recitation, and was elected president of the school's literary association. He then attended [[Amherst College]] with [[Charles Millard Pratt]], a close friend who was the son of Folger's mentor from the Adelphi Academy. To fund his education, Folger participated in many oratorical essay contests; he won prizes for competitions in 1876 and 1879, the latter of which paid for his junior year of school. Folger modeled his rhetorical style on [[Daniel Webster]]'s. He identified a Shakespeare-related essay contest as the origin of his obsession with the Bard. Emily, however, later attributed the origin of Folger's fascination with Shakespeare to an 1879 lecture by [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]], whose elegant and eloquent delivery sounded Shakespearean to the college student. Folger was a member of the [[Alpha Delta Phi]] fraternity, graduating [[Phi Beta Kappa]] in 1879.  After Amherst, he attended [[Columbia Law School]] from 1879 to 1881, and was admitted to the bar in 1881.<ref name=\"Grant2014\">{{cite book|author=Stephen H.

Rockefeller]], getting his start in the oil business as a clerk at Charles Pratt & Company, a refinery owned by [[Charles Pratt]], the father of his Adelphi and Amherst classmate [[Charles Millard Pratt]]. The Pratt Company was already associated with Standard Oil at that time.<ref>Lynch, Kathleen, \"Folger, Henry Clay,\" ''American National Biography,'' [[John Garatty]] and Mark Carnes (eds.) New York: Oxford University Press, 1999. Volume 8, pp. 169\u2013170.</ref> Folger quickly showed his prowess as a mathematician and statistician; his management of data on oil processing led to a promotion in 1886, when he became the secretary of Standard Oil's manufacturing committee. In 1890, Folger wrote ''Petroleum: Its Production and Products in Pennsylvania'', an article for [[Chambers's Encyclopaedia]] about the oil business.\n\nFolger's assets increased in 1899, when he was promoted to chairman of the manufacturing committee, the same year that Standard Oil of New Jersey became the central holding company for the Standard Oil Trust, which dissolved after the passage of the [[Sherman Antitrust Act]]. The stock Folger held in Standard Oil of New Jersey would contribute significantly to Folger's ability to collect Shakespeareana. In 1908, he was elected assistant treasurer of Jersey Standard, and joined its board of sixteen directors, managing the company's finances and compiling production data. That year, Folger was also elected to Jersey Standard's executive committee.\n\nThe 1911 [[Standard Oil Co. of New Jersey v. United States|Supreme Court decision]] to break up the Standard Oil Company of New Jersey monopoly resulted in the election of Folger as president of the second-largest company formed from the dissolved Jersey Standard, the [[Mobil|Standard Oil Company of New York]], or Socony. Folger also owned significant amounts of stock in the [[Magnolia Petroleum Company]], a Texan company that became a fully owned subsidiary of Socony in 1925. He retired as president in 1923, but stayed at Socony as the first chairman of its board of trustees until 1928, when he officially retired to devote all of his attention to plans for his Shakespeare Library. Folger was succeeded as president by [[Herbert L. Pratt]], another son of Charles Pratt.\n\nIn 1956, the Folger Shakespeare Library received Folger's walnut desk from Socony Mobil Oil. Since that year, it has been used by the Library's director.<ref name= \"Grant2014\"/>\n\n==Marriage to Emily Clara Jordan==\nHenry Clay Folger met Emily Clara Jordan in the early 1880s at a meeting of the Irving Literary Circle in Brooklyn. Both were close, respectively, with the Pratt siblings Charles and Lillie. Early in their relationship, Henry and Emily connected via Shakespeare. At an 1882 picnic held by the Irving Literary Circle, Charles and Lillie prompted the two to each give a toast; Emily drew from ''[[Othello]]''. while Henry quoted from ''[[As You Like It]]''. She was born in 1858 and was educated at [[Vassar College]]. They married on October 6, 1885 at Westminster Presbyterian Church in [[Elizabeth, New Jersey]], where Emily had spent her teenage years. The Folgers had no children. They lived in rented houses in Brooklyn throughout most of their lives, moving to [[Bedford-Stuyvesant]] in 1895 and to 24 Brevoot Place in 1910, but later purchased an estate in Glen Cove, Long Island in 1929.<ref name=\"Grant2014\"/>\n\nThe Folgers took annual vacations to [[The Omni Homestead Resort|The Homestead]] resort in [[Hot Springs, Virginia]], where Henry enjoyed participating in golf tournaments in his later years. Though the Folgers had no children, they considered their collection to be their descendants, and Henry was known to refer to his rare books as \"the boys.\"<ref name=\"Grant2014\"/>\n\n==Shakespeare collecting==\nFolger was an avid collector of Shakespeareana, assembling the world's largest collection of [[First Folio]] editions of Shakespeare's plays.<ref name=\"nybooks.com\">[http://www.nybooks.com/articles/21514 The Library in the New Age, an article by Robert Darnton]</ref> The first rare book Folger acquired was a 1685 copy of the [[Early texts of Shakespeare's works#Folios|Fourth Folio]], purchased in 1889 for $107.50. He purchased his first original copy of the First Folio four years later, in 1893. Unlike other wealthy collectors of the period, like [[Henry E. Huntington]] and [[J.P. Morgan]], Folger favored \"imperfect\" copies of rare volumes, with their [[marginalia]] and other markings. Following this trend, his Folio collection was marked with diversity in provenance and condition. He preferred to purchase Early Editions of books published between 1567 and 1606, in addition to manuscripts of the period. Based on their collective knowledge of Latin and French, and Emily's proficiency in German, the couple also favored rare volumes published on the Continent in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. The couple was less interested in art collection, and many of the Shakespeare-related paintings they purchased were misattributed to artists like [[Thomas Gainsborough]].\n\nThe Folgers chose items to purchase from booksellers' catalogues, which were initially perused and marked up by Emily, before she passed them on to Henry, who kept an extensive and precise list of items he intended to bid on. If possible, he inspected an item personally before purchasing it. He also avoided consulting scholarly experts about rare volumes, preferring his own and Emily's expertise, as she received an M.A. from [[Vassar College]] in 1896 for a thesis on Shakespeare. Folger used professional booksellers as middlemen at auctions, believing that the concealment of his identity would keep prices low. Due to the growing size of the collection and their concern for fireproofing, eventually few of the Folgers' acquisitions were stored in their living space. They kept an extensive card catalog at home in Brooklyn, and when traveling, took a smaller, annotated set of check lists along with them. The collection itself was stored among several fireproof warehouse companies throughout Manhattan, in specially-designed wooden cases originally meant to hold two five-gallon cans of oil each. Frederick Fales, a co-worker of Folger's at Standard Oil, initially designed and ordered these air-tight wooden cases for company use.<ref>Grant, pp. 111\u2013118.</ref> Some of the most valuable items were kept in bank vaults, or in a safe in Folger's office.\n\nFolger financed a half-century of collecting with his Standard Oil salary and extensive investments in the company. His high placement at Standard Oil also allowed him to take out loans with his friend Charles Millard Pratt, [[John D. Rockefeller]], and even his wife, to fund his purchases. He generally paid for items in cash, a strategy that earned him the favor of many booksellers who needed immediate funds. Folger also preferred to purchase whole collections, like the [[James Halliwell-Phillipps|Halliwell-Phillipps]] collection, acquired in 1908, because bulk purchases drove down prices of individual items.<ref name= \"Grant2014\"/>\n\nIn 1909, Folger established a Shakespeare Prize at Amherst; winning students won a cash prize, and their essays joined Folger's collection and currently reside in the Folger Shakespeare Library. Folger also made donations to Amherst College's library, contributing many duplicate volumes purchased at auction to the College. The most valuable of these donations were two leaves from a [[Gutenberg Bible]].<ref name=\"Grant2014\"/>\n\n==Folger Shakespeare Library==\n{{main|Folger Shakespeare Library}}\nEarly in his career at Standard Oil and as a collector, Folger doubted that he would eventually have the funds to build a memorial or library for his growing collection, and in 1895 he offered to sell it to John D. Rockefeller, who refused. Before he acquired the funds for what was to become the [[Folger Shakespeare Library]], Folger also debated selling the collection to a university.<ref name= \"Grant2014\"/>\n\nToward the end of [[World War I]], Folger and his wife began searching for a location for his Shakespeare library. Among the sites he and Emily considered were Amherst and Nantucket, Massachusetts, the University of Chicago, New York City, and [[Stratford-upon-Avon]], before they settled on a Washington, D.C. site they discovered in 1918 during a layover in the city while traveling to Hot Springs. Folger spent nine years purchasing the fourteen row houses that occupied the block of East Capitol Street between First and Second Streets, which he would demolish to build his Library; thus, they did not make their choice of a site on Capitol Hill public until 1928. Soon afterwards, [[United States Congress|Congress]] passed a resolution allowing use of the land on East Capitol Street where the Folger Shakespeare Library now stands.\n\nAfter the passage of this legislation, Folger hired [[Paul Philippe Cret]] as the Library's architect, suggested by Alexander Trowbridge, an architect who had married into the Pratt family and stayed on the project as consulting architect. Folger played an integral part in the design and execution of the Library's classical exterior and Tudor interior. The inclusion of an Elizabethan theater within the Library's main building was also Folger's idea, though he intended it as a venue for academic lectures rather than performances. Folger hired sculptor John Gregory to design the relief sculptures that appear on the building's facade. The [[cornerstone]] of the library was laid in 1930, but Henry Folger died soon afterward.  The bulk of his fortune was left in [[Charitable trust|trust]] for the library, with [[Amherst College]] as trust administrator. With additional funding from Emily Folger, the library opened in 1932 on April 23, the date traditionally believed to be Shakespeare's birthday. Folger's collection of Shakespearean works is considered one of the most important resources for scholars of the playwright.<ref name=\"nybooks.com\"/>\n\n==Other interests and activities==\n[[File:Central Cong'l Church, Brooklyn, by L. G. Strand.jpg|thumb|Central Congregational Church]]\nFolger was a trustee of the Hamilton Trust Company, Brooklyn, New York, and a director of Seaboard National Bank in New York.  In 1914 he was awarded an honorary Doctor of Letters degree from [[Amherst College|Amherst]]. Outside of work, his great interests were his Shakespeare collection and, in later life, golf, which he often played with Rockefeller.<ref name=\"Lynch, page 170\">Lynch, p. 170.</ref> He was a trustee of the Central Congregational Church in Brooklyn<ref name=\"Lynch, page 170\"/> and established the [[Shakespeare Garden]] at the [[Brooklyn Botanic Garden]].<ref>[http://www.bbg.org/exp/stroll/shakespeare.html Brooklyn Botanic Garden: Shakespeare Garden<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\nIn a 1933 lecture delivered after his death, Emily identified ''[[King Lear]]'' as his favorite of Shakespeare's plays.<ref name= \"Grant2014\"/>\n\n==Death==\nIn May 1930, Henry Folger was admitted to St. John's Hospital in Brooklyn for surgery on an enlarged prostate. While recovering, he continued to work on the construction and development of his Shakespeare Library from his sickbed. He later had a second prostate operation prior to his death on June 11, 1930. His funeral was held at Brooklyn's Central Congregational Church, where he had been an active member.<ref>Grant, p. 163.</ref> Reverend Samuel Parkes Cadman, who, along with his wife, had been close with the Folgers, gave Henry's eulogy.<ref>Mays, Andrea.

The new rules required a 3.5L naturally aspirated engine to be used.  Thus in 1991 Toyota completed their RV10 engines and began early testing.\n\nDue to the change in engines, a whole new chassis was also necessary in order to better handle the new V10.  Former [[Tom Walkinshaw Racing]] designer [[Tony Southgate]] was in charge of designing the car that became the TS010, featuring a more aerodynamic and longer body than the ''C-V'' series of sportscars.  TS010 #002 would be completed towards the end of 1991, and Toyota chose to debut the car at the final round of the 1991 WSC season at [[Autopolis]].  The car, driven by Britons [[Geoff Lees (racing driver)|Geoff Lees]] and [[Andy Wallace (racing driver)|Andy Wallace]] and run by half English, half Japanese squad [[Tom's]], finished 6th overall, only three laps behind the winning [[Mercedes-Benz]].\n\nFor the start of the 1992 season, Toyota's main competitors came in the form of the [[Peugeot 905]], which had been launched late in 1990.  At the start of the season in Monza, four chassis had been completed.  Toyota chose to run two cars while a third spare car would run in practice only to help the team prepare for the races.  At Monza, Toyota was able to secure its first victory after the leading Peugeot crashed out, with chassis #002 being among the few cars to finish the rain-soaked race in the hands of [[Geoff Lees (racing driver)|Geoff Lees]] and Hitoshi Ogawa.  However, TS010 #004 was badly damaged in an accident early in the race.\n\nAt the second round of the season, both TS010's failed to finish due to problems.  However at the [[1992 24 Hours of Le Mans|24 Hours of Le Mans]], with the completion of fresh chassis #005 and #006, Toyota entered three cars in the event.  Two were able to finish, with one taking 2nd place, 6 laps behind the winning Peugeot.  The other finisher managed 8th overall.\n[[Image:Toyota TS010 Goodwood.jpg|thumb|left|200px|A TS010 at [[Goodwood Festival of Speed|Goodwood]]]]\nFor the next two races at [[Donington Park]] and Toyota's home race at [[Suzuka Circuit]], the TS010 was only able to finish behind the dominating Peugeots, each time having the second TS010 failing to finish.  At the final round at [[Circuit de Nevers Magny-Cours]], both TS010s would finish, taking 3rd and 4th behind Peugeot once again.  With the season over, Toyota would take 2nd in the teams championship, although they only managed to earn approximately half the points that Peugeot won.\n\nAfter the race at Suzuka, Toyota left a single TS010 in Japan to compete in the final two rounds of the [[All Japan Sports Prototype Championship]].  The TS010 took victory at [[Fuji Speedway]], then was joined by a second TS010 after the [[World Sportscar Championship]] had ended.  The team took 1st and 4th, defeating factory efforts from [[Nissan]] and [[Mazda]].  These two wins secured Toyota a manufacturer's championship in the [[Group C]] category in JSPC.\n\nFor 1993, both the World Sportscar Championship and All Japan Sports Prototype Championships were cancelled, leaving the TS010s with nowhere to race except at that year's [[24 Hours of Le Mans]].  For the race, another three chassis would be built specifically for this race, numbered #007, #008, and #009. Future Formula One driver [[Eddie Irvine]], [[Masanori Sekiya]], and [[Toshio Suzuki (driver)|Toshio Suzuki]] would bring a TS010 home in 4th overall, behind the trio of [[Peugeot]]s.  A second TS010 would take 8th, while the third car failed to finish.  Following this race, with no place to compete, the TS010 was officially retired and Toyota concentrated on their [[International Motor Sports Association|IMSA]] efforts in the [[United States]].\n\n{{Toyota Sportscar Racers}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Toyota Ts010}}\n[[Category:Group C cars]]\n[[Category:Toyota vehicles|TS010]]\n[[Category:24 Hours of Le Mans race cars]]\n", "text_old": "{{Unreferenced|date=December 2009}}\n{{Racing car |\n  Image = [[File:The frontview of No.33 Toyota TS010 CASIO.jpg|250px]] |\n  Category = [[Group C]] [[sports prototype]] |  \n  Car_name = Toyota TS010 |\n  Constructor = [[Toyota]]<br>(with [[Tom's]]) | \n  Team = {{Flagicon|JPN}} [[Tom's|Toyota Team Tom's]] |\n  Designer = [[Tony Southgate]] | \n  Test drivers = |\n  Chassis =  |\n  Front suspension = [[Double wishbone suspension]], coil-spring over damper |\n  Rear suspension = [[Double wishbone suspension]], coil-spring over damper |\n  Engine position = [[MR layout|mid-mounted]]. |\n  Engine name = [[Toyota]] RV10 |\n  Capacity = 3500&nbsp;cc |\n  Turbo/NA = NA, |\n  Configuration = [[V10 engine|V10]]. |\n  Gearbox name = |\n  Gears =  |\n  Type = [[Manual transmission]] |\n  Differential = |\n  Tyres = [[Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company|Goodyear]] <small>(1992)</small><br>[[Michelin]] <small>(1993)</small> |\n  Fuel = [[Elf Aquitaine|Elf]] |\n |Drivers={{flagicon|GBR}} [[Geoff Lees (racing driver)|Geoff Lees]]<br>{{flagicon|GBR}} [[Andy Wallace]] <br> {{flagicon|GBR}} [[Eddie Irvine]]  <br> {{flagicon|GBR}} [[Kenny Acheson]] <br> {{flagicon|FRA}} [[Pierre-Henri Raphanel]] <br> {{flagicon|JPN}} [[Hitoshi Ogawa]]<br> {{flagicon|JPN}} [[Masanori Sekiya]] <br> {{flagicon|JPN}} [[Toshio Suzuki]]<br>{{flagicon|NLD}} [[Jan Lammers]]<br> {{flagicon|ITA}} [[Teo Fabi]]<br>{{flagicon|AUS}} [[David Brabham]]<br>{{flagicon|DEN}} [[Tom Kristensen (racing driver)|Tom Kristensen]] <br> {{flagicon|CAN}} [[Jacques Villeneuve]] <br> {{flagicon|ARG}} [[Juan Manuel Fangio II]]\n |Debut = [[1991 430km of Autopolis|1991 430&nbsp;km of Autopolis]] |\n  Races         = 10 |\n  Cons_champ    = 1 <small>(1992 JSPC C Class)</small> |\n  Drivers_champ = 1 <small>(1992 JSPC C Class)</small> |\n  Wins          = 3 |\n  Poles         = 0 |\n  Fastest_laps  = 4 |\n  Last_season   = 1993 |\n}}\nThe '''Toyota TS010''' was a [[Group C]] [[racing car]] built by [[Toyota]] for the [[World Sportscar Championship|Sportscar World Championship]], [[All Japan Sports Prototype Championship]], and the [[24 Hours of Le Mans]].\n\n==History==\nDue to rule changes in the [[World Sportscar Championship]] for 1992, Toyota was forced to replace their previous series of [[Group C]] sportscars, known as ''C-V'', which used the R36V 3.6L twin turbocharged V8.

In its infancy, OsCommerce was referred to by Ponce de Leon as \"a side thing\" and \"an example research study\". By late 2001, a team formed for its development and in the words of HPDL, this was the point the team started taking the project seriously.<ref>{{cite web|title=OsCommerce \u2013 a brief history and a look at the features|url=https://www.maysdigital.co.uk/what-is-oscommerce/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150906063854/https://www.maysdigital.co.uk/what-is-oscommerce/|url-status=dead|archive-date=6 September 2015|publisher=Mays Digital|accessdate=23 July 2015}}</ref>{{unreliable source?|date=December 2016}}\n\nAs of August 2008, OsCommerce reported over 14,000 'live' websites using the program.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}{{Needs update|date=July 2015}} This number is almost certainly conservative, given the inclusion of OsCommerce in hosting panel application installers such as [[Fantastico (web hosting)|Fantastico]] and [[Softaculous]].\n\nIn November 2010 the development of OsCommerce v2.2 was met with another stable release. Version 2.3, as it was branded, takes advantage of the benefits of [[tableless web design]], and includes a number of social networking tools.<ref>{{cite web|last=Ponce de Leon|first=Harald|title=osCommerce Online Merchant v2.3|url=http://www.oscommerce.com/about/news,134|work=osCommerce Development Blog|accessdate=20 March 2011}}</ref>\n\nThe current iteration is version 3.x (in development) and is a major re-write of the program to incorporate an object-oriented backend, a template system to allow easy layout changes, and inclusion of an administration-area username and password definition during installation. The latest development version is 3.0.2, and was released on 6 August 2011.<ref>{{cite web|title=osCommerce Online Merchant v3.0.2|url=http://www.oscommerce.com/about/news,138|work=Part of osCommerce news}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Releases - osCommerce|url=https://github.com/osCommerce/oscommerce/releases|publisher=GitHub|accessdate=23 July 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Official Version==\n\nThere are currently two official releases of OsCommerce. Versions 2.3 (stable) and 3.0 (in development) are developed as two independent programs, and as such do not share code.

It can be used on any [[web server]] that has [[PHP]] and [[MySQL]] installed. It is available as [[free software]] under the [[GNU General Public License]].\n\n==History==\nOsCommerce was started in March 2000 in Germany by project founder and leader Harald Ponce de Leon as ''The Exchange Project''. In its infancy, OsCommerce was referred to by Ponce de Leon as \"a side thing\" and \"an example research study\". By late 2001, a team formed for its development and in the words of HPDL, this was the point the team started taking the project seriously.<ref>{{cite web|title=OsCommerce \u2013 a brief history and a look at the features|url=https://www.maysdigital.co.uk/what-is-oscommerce/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150906063854/https://www.maysdigital.co.uk/what-is-oscommerce/|url-status=dead|archive-date=6 September 2015|publisher=Mays Digital|accessdate=23 July 2015}}</ref>{{unreliable source?|date=December 2016}}\n\nAs of August 2008, OsCommerce reported over 14,000 'live' websites using the program.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}{{Needs update|date=July 2015}} This number is almost certainly conservative, given the inclusion of OsCommerce in hosting panel application installers such as [[Fantastico (web hosting)|Fantastico]] and [[Softaculous]].\n\nIn November 2010 the development of OsCommerce v2.2 was met with another stable release. Version 2.3, as it was branded, takes advantage of the benefits of [[tableless web design]], and includes a number of social networking tools.<ref>{{cite web|last=Ponce de Leon|first=Harald|title=osCommerce Online Merchant v2.3|url=http://www.oscommerce.com/about/news,134|work=osCommerce Development Blog|accessdate=20 March 2011}}</ref>\n\nThe current iteration is version 3.x (in development) and is a major re-write of the program to incorporate an object-oriented backend, a template system to allow easy layout changes, and inclusion of an administration-area username and password definition during installation. The latest development version is 3.0.2, and was released on 6 August 2011.<ref>{{cite web|title=osCommerce Online Merchant v3.0.2|url=http://www.oscommerce.com/about/news,138|work=Part of osCommerce news}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Releases - osCommerce|url=https://github.com/osCommerce/oscommerce/releases|publisher=GitHub|accessdate=23 July 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Official Version==\n\nThere are currently two official releases of OsCommerce. Versions 2.3 (stable) and 3.0 (in development) are developed as two independent programs, and as such do not share code. Apps, the official name for the open-source community developed plugins, are developed for either 2.x or 3.0, and are incompatible with one another.\n\nThe Official version has not had any substantive updates for some time.
