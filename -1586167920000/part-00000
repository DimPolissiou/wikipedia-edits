It is the capital of [[B\u1eafc Giang Province]]. Its name, deriving from that of the Province [[Sino-Vietnamese vocabulary|Sino-Vietnamese]], means \"north of the river.\"  The location is very convenient for transportation: it is 50&nbsp;km north of Hanoi, in the middle position on major transportation routes (roads, international railway) connecting Hanoi with the L\u1ea1ng S\u01a1n City and \u0110\u1ed3ng \u0110\u0103ng international border gate; B\u1eafc Giang is located in an important transportation hub. The [[Th\u01b0\u01a1ng River]] runs through the town's southern part heading for [[Haiphong]].\n\nAlthough the name of B\u1eafc Giang (\u5317\u6c5f \"North River\") Province is very old, established in its first form in 1466, there was historically no town of that name. The town was created out the old L\u00e1ng Th\u01b0\u1ee3ng District after independence.<ref>''B\u1eafc Giang th\u1ebf v\u00e0 l\u1ef1c m\u1edbi trong th\u1ebf k\u1ef7 XXI'' published C\u00f4ng ty c\u1ed5 ph\u1ea7n th\u00f4ng tin kinh t\u1ebf \u0111\u1ed1i ngo\u1ea1i 2002 - Page 21 \"B\u1eafc Giang Town was formerly called L\u00e1ng Th\u01b0\u1ee3ng District. After the victory of the war of resistance against the French colonialists, Vietnamese authorities had decided to set up B\u1eafc Giang Town.</ref> The Su\u1ed1i M\u1ee1 thermal springs area is 37&nbsp;km from the town centre.<ref>Minh tr\u1ecb L\u01b0u ''Historical remains & beautiful places of Hanoi and the surrounding area''  Page 268 2000 \"Su\u1ed1i M\u01a1 Relics is in Nghia Ph\u01b0\u01a1ng commune, L\u1ee5c Ng\u1ea1n district, 37 km from B\u1eafc Giang town. It is dedicated to God of the soil, [[Lady Lord of Forestry]] princess [[Qu\u1ebf M\u1ef5 N\u01b0\u01a1ng]], daughter of the 16th H\u00f9ng King.\"</ref> B\u1eafc Giang Peace Park was a sister city project with [[Madison, Wisconsin]], United States.<ref>Cumulative list of organizations described in section 170  Volume 2 - Page 1907 United States.

[[Vietnam]]. It is the capital of [[B\u1eafc Giang Province]]. Its name, deriving from that of the Province [[Sino-Vietnamese vocabulary|Sino-Vietnamese]], means \"north of the river.\"  The location is very convenient for transportation: it is 50&nbsp;km north of Hanoi, in the middle position on major transportation routes (roads, international railway) connecting Hanoi with the L\u1ea1ng S\u01a1n City and \u0110\u1ed3ng \u0110\u0103ng international border gate; B\u1eafc Giang is located in an important transportation hub. The [[Th\u01b0\u01a1ng River]] runs through the town's southern part heading for [[Haiphong]].\n\nAlthough the name of B\u1eafc Giang (\u5317\u6c5f \"North River\") Province is very old, established in its first form in 1466, there was historically no town of that name. The town was created out the old L\u00e1ng Th\u01b0\u1ee3ng District after independence.<ref>''B\u1eafc Giang th\u1ebf v\u00e0 l\u1ef1c m\u1edbi trong th\u1ebf k\u1ef7 XXI'' published C\u00f4ng ty c\u1ed5 ph\u1ea7n th\u00f4ng tin kinh t\u1ebf \u0111\u1ed1i ngo\u1ea1i 2002 - Page 21 \"B\u1eafc Giang Town was formerly called L\u00e1ng Th\u01b0\u1ee3ng District. After the victory of the war of resistance against the French colonialists, Vietnamese authorities had decided to set up B\u1eafc Giang Town.</ref> The Su\u1ed1i M\u1ee1 thermal springs area is 37&nbsp;km from the town centre.<ref>Minh tr\u1ecb L\u01b0u ''Historical remains & beautiful places of Hanoi and the surrounding area''  Page 268 2000 \"Su\u1ed1i M\u01a1 Relics is in Nghia Ph\u01b0\u01a1ng commune, L\u1ee5c Ng\u1ea1n district, 37 km from B\u1eafc Giang town. It is dedicated to God of the soil, [[Lady Lord of Forestry]] princess [[Qu\u1ebf M\u1ef5 N\u01b0\u01a1ng]], daughter of the 16th H\u00f9ng King.\"</ref> B\u1eafc Giang Peace Park was a sister city project with [[Madison, Wisconsin]], United States.<ref>Cumulative list of organizations described in section 170  Volume 2 - Page 1907 United States.

Factor analysis is applied to tooth size to achieve tooth shape. Results have shown that the dental morphology of Andaman Islanders resembles that of South Asians, whereas Philippine Negrito groups more closely resemble southeast Asians in their dental morphology. Therefore, the dental morphology of the Andamanese indicates a retention of dental morphology from early South Asians in the early-mid Holocene. Overall the dental morphology of the Andamanese is found to be distant from that of modern East Asians.

His main biographical sources in chronological order are:{{sfn|Mookerji|1988|pp=3-14}}\n*Greek and Roman sources, which are the oldest surviving records that mention Chandragupta or circumstances related to him; these include those by [[Nearchus]], [[Onesicritus]], [[Aristobulus of Cassandreia|Aristobulus]], [[Strabo]], [[Megasthenes]], [[Diodorus]], [[Arrian]], [[Pliny the Elder]], [[Plutarch]] and [[Justin (historian)|Justin]].\n*among the oldest dated Indian sources on Chandragupta are Hindu texts such as the [[Puranas]] and ''[[Arthashastra]]''; later composed Hindu sources include legends in [[Vishakhadatta]]'s ''[[Mudrarakshasa]]'', [[Somadeva]]'s ''[[Kathasaritsagara]]'' and [[Kshemendra]]'s ''[[Brihatkathamanjari]]''.\n*the earliest mentions of Chandragupta in Buddhist sources are those dated in 4th-century or after; these include the Sri Lankan Pali texts ''[[Dipavamsa]]'' (''rajavamsa'' section), ''[[Mahavamsa]]'', ''[[Mahavamsa tika]]'' and ''[[Mahabodhivamsa]]''.\n*the earliest sources that the Digambara Jain tradition state to be mentioning Chandragupta with Bhadrabahu appear in 7th\u2013 to 10th-century inscriptions at Sravana Belgola; this is disputed by scholars as well as the Svetambara Jain tradition;<ref name=\"Wiley2009p50\"/><ref name=\"Fleet1\"/> the first Digambara text interpreted to be mentioning the Maurya emperor are dated to about the 10th-century such as in the ''Brhatkathakosa'' of [[Harisena (Jain monk)|Harisena]], while the complete Jain legend about Chandragupta is found the 12th-century ''[[Parisishtaparvan]]'' by [[Hemachandra]].\n\nThe Greek and Roman texts, but for one exception, do not mention Chandragupta directly. They predominantly mention a mean and cruel king named Nanda, born to a queen after her affair with a barber, one who assassinated the king and came to power by a coup. Chandragupta later removed Nanda from power. The exception that does mention Chandragupta directly is the 2nd-century text by the Roman historian Justin. He states Chandragupta was of \u201chumble origin\u201d, then includes stories of miraculous legends associated with him, such as a wild elephant appearing and submitting itself as a ride to him before a war. The Justin version states Chandragupta and Chanakya defeated and removed the evil Nanda king.{{sfn|Mookerji|1988|pp=5-7}} The account of Megasthenes, as it has survived in Greek texts that quote him, states that Alexander the Great and Sandrocottos (Chandragupta) met, which if true would mean his rule started earlier than 321 BCE. He is described as a great king, but not as great in his power and reach as Porus in northwestern India or Agrammes (Dhana Nanda) in eastern India.<ref name=\"Singh2017p264\">{{cite book|author=Upinder Singh|title= Political Violence in Ancient India |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=t6A4DwAAQBAJ |year=2017| publisher= Harvard University Press|isbn= 978-0-674-97527-9|pages= 264\u2013265}}</ref>\n\nThe pre-4th century Brahmanical (Hindu) Puranic texts mostly mirror the Greek sources. These Hindu texts do not discuss the details of Chandragupta\u2019s ancestry, rather cover the ancestry of the Nanda king he unseated from the kingdom. The Nanda king is described as someone mean and cruel, persecuting people, as one against dharma and sastras, born out of an illicit relationship followed by coup.{{sfn|R. K. Mookerji|1966|pp=7\u20139}} The Chanakya\u2019s \u2018\u2019Arthasastra\u2019\u2019 refers to the Nanda rule as against the \u201cspiritual, cultural and military\u201d interests of the country, a period where intrigue and vice multiplied.{{sfn|R. K. Mookerji|1966|pp=7\u20139}} Chanakya states that Chandragupta returned dharma, nurtured a diversity of views, and a virtuous rule that kindled love among the subjects for his rule.{{sfn|R. K. Mookerji|1966|pp=7\u20139}}\n\nHindu sources are inconsistent. One medieval commentator states Chandragupta to be the son of one of the Nanda\u2019s wives with the name \u201cMura\u201d.{{sfn|R. K. Mookerji|1966|pp=7\u20139}} Another Sanskrit dramatic text ''[[Mudrarakshasa]]'' uses the terms \"Vrishala\" and \"Kula-hina\" to describe Chandragupta.{{sfn|R. K. Mookerji|1966|pp=9\u201311}}  The word \"Vrishala\u201d has two meanings, one the \"son of a [[Shudra]]\u201d, another meaning being the \"best of kings\". A later commentator used the former interpretation to posit that Chandragupta came from a Shudra background. However, historian R. K. Mookerji opposes this theory, and states that the word should be interpreted as \"the best of kings\u201d.{{sfn|R. K. Mookerji|1966|pp=9\u201311}} The same drama also refers to Chandragupta as someone of humble origin, in a manner similar to Justin.{{sfn|R. K. Mookerji|1966|pp=9\u201311}} According to the 11th-century texts of the Kashmiri Hindu tradition \u2013 ''[[Kathasaritsagara]]'' and ''Brihat-Katha-Manjari'' \u2013 the Nanda lineage was very short, of two competing Shudra power centers. Chandragupta was a son of Purva-Nanda, the older Nanda based in Ayodhya.{{sfn|Mookerji|1966|p=13}}{{sfn|Mookerji|1988|pp=15-18}}{{refn|group=note|According to Kaushik Roy, Chandragupta Maurya was a [[Shudra]] lineage king.{{sfn|Roy|2012|pp=61-62}}}} The most common theme in the Hindu sources is that Chandragupta came from a humble background and with Chanakya he emerged as a dharmic king loved by his subjects.{{sfn|R. K. Mookerji|1966|pp=7\u201313}}\n\nThe Buddhist texts such as ''[[Mahavamsa]]'' describe Chandragupta as of [[Kshatriya]] origin.{{sfn|Mookerji|1988|p=14}} These sources, written about seven centuries after his dynasty ended, state that both Chandragupta and his grandson Ashoka \u2013 the great patron of Buddhism, were of the same noble family of Sakyas from which the [[Buddha]] came, but one that branched off.{{sfn|Mookerji|1988|pp=13-15}} These Buddhist sources thus attempt to link the dynasty of their patron Ashoka directly to the Buddha \u2013 the founder of their faith.{{sfn|Thapar|1961|p=12}} The branching, claim these sources, occurred to escape the persecution of a cruel king from Kosala and Chandragupta\u2019s ancestors moved into a secluded Himalayan kingdom known for its peacocks. The Buddhist sources explain the epithet ''Moriya'' comes from these peacocks, or ''Mora'' in Pali (Sanskrit: Mayura).{{sfn|Mookerji|1988|pp=13-15}}<ref name=britchandrag/> The Buddhist texts are, however, also inconsistent. Some offer other legends to explain his epithet. For example, they mention a city named \"Moriya-nagara\" where all buildings were made of bricks colored like the peacock's resplendent neck.{{sfn|Mookerji|1988|pp=13-14}}  The ''Maha-bodhi-vamsa'' states he hailed from Moriya-nagara, while the ''Digha-Nikaya'' states he came from the Moriya clan of Pipphalivana.{{sfn|Mookerji|1966|p=14}} The Buddhist sources also mention that \u201cBrahmin Chanakya\u201d was his counselor and with whose support Chandragupta became the king at Patliputra.{{sfn|Mookerji|1988|pp=13-14}}\n\n[[File:7th-century Bhadrabahu Sanskrit inscription, Purvahale Kannada script, Shravanabelgola Karnataka.jpg|thumb|upright=1.65|7th-century Bhadrabahu inscription at Shravanabelagola (Sanskrit, Purvahale Kannada script).

[[Plutarch]] claims that he was a young man when he met [[Alexander the Great|Alexander]] during the [[Indian campaign of Alexander the Great|latter's invasion of India]] (c. 326-325 BCE). Assuming the Plutarch account is true, Raychaudhuri proposed in 1923 that Chandragupta may have been born after c. 350 BCE.{{sfn|Raychaudhuri|1923|p=142}} According to other Greco-Roman texts, Chandragupta attacked the Greek-Indian governors after Alexander's death (c. 323 CE) with [[Seleucus I Nicator]] entering into a treaty with Chandragupta years later.{{sfn|Raychaudhuri|1923|p=137}}  Seleucus Nicator, under this treaty, gave up Arachosia (Kandahar), Gedrosia (Makran) and Paropanisadai(Paropamisadae, Kabul) to Chandragupta, in exchange for 500 war elephants.<ref name=\"Singh2017p264\"/>\n\nThe texts do not include the start or end year of Chandragupta's reign.{{sfn|Raychaudhuri|1923|p=138}} According to some Hindu and the Buddhist texts, Chandragupta's ruled for 24 years.{{sfn|Thapar|1961|p=13}} The Buddhist sources state Chandragupta Maurya ruled 162 years after the death of the Buddha.{{sfn|Raychaudhuri|1967|pp=134\u2013142}} However, the birth and death of the Buddha varies by source and all these lead to a chronology that is significantly different than the Greek-Roman records. Similarly, Jain sources composed nearly 1,200 years after Chandragupta\u2019s death give different gap between Mahavira\u2019s death and his accession.{{sfn|Raychaudhuri|1967|pp=134\u2013142}} As with Buddha's death, the date of Mahavira's death itself is also a matter of debate, and the inconsistencies and lack of unanimity among the Jain authors casts doubt on Jain sources. This Digambara Jain chronology, in addition, is not reconcilable with the chronology implied in other Indian and non-Indian sources.{{sfn|Raychaudhuri|1967|pp=134\u2013142}}\n\nHistorians such as Irfan Habib and Vivekanand Jha assign Chandragupta's reign to c. 322-298 BCE.{{sfn|Habib|Jha|2004|p=15}} Upinder Singh dates his rule from 324 or 321 BCE to 297 BCE.{{sfn|Singh|2016|p=331}} Kristi Wiley states he reigned between 320 and 293 BCE.<ref name=\"Wiley2009p50\"/>\n\n=== Early life ===\n\nThe early life of Chandragupta Maurya is unclear and varies by source. According to the Sinhalese Buddhist tradition, Chandragupta's father - who was the chief of the Moriya clan - was killed in a battle, when his mother was pregnant. His mother escaped to the Puppha-pura (Pushpa-pura, literally \"flower city\", Patliputra) city with the help of her brothers. For Chandragupta safety, his maternal uncles helped a cattle-raising family adopt him as a baby. He was brought up by a [[cowman (profession)|cowherd]]. When Chandragupta grew up, the cowherd sold him to a hunter, who employed him to tend cattle.{{sfn|Mookerji|1966|p=16}}{{sfn|Raychaudhuri|1967|p=143}}\n\nAccording to the Digambara legend by Hemachandra, Chanakya was a Jain layperson and a Brahmin. When Chanakya was born, Jain monks prophesied that Chanakya will one day grow up to help make someone an emperor and will be the power behind the throne.{{sfn|Mookerji|1966|p=6}}<ref name=\"Hemacandra1998\"/> Chanakya believed in the prophecy. He began making it true by agreeing to help the daughter of the chief of a peacock breeding community to deliver a baby boy. In exchange, for his fee, he asked the mother to give up the boy and let him adopt him at a later date.{{sfn|Mookerji|1966|p=14}}<ref name=\"Hemacandra1998\"/> The Jain Brahmin then went about making money through magic, and returned later to claim boy Chandragupta.<ref name=\"Hemacandra1998\"/> He taught and trained him. Together, they recruited soldiers and began their violent attack of the local kingdom. First they failed, but later through alliances, they won the Nanda kingdom and proclaimed Patliputra as their capital.<ref name=\"Hemacandra1998\"/>\n\n==Career==\n=== Influence of Chanakya (Kautilya) ===\n[[File:Chanakya artistic depiction.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|left|alt=Chanakya|Chandragupta's [[guru]] was Chanakya, with whom he studied as a child and with whose counsel he built the Empire.

Broadly, they mention boy Chandragupta created a mock game of a royal court wherein his cowherd friends and he played. Chanakya saw the boy making decisions, approached the hunter, paid him off and adopted Chandragupta.{{sfn|Mookerji|1966|pp=15\u201317}} He took the young Chandragupta, taught him, and then admitted him in Taxila to study the Vedas, military arts, law and other sastras.{{sfn|Mookerji|1966|pp=15\u201317}}\n\nAfter Taxila, Chandragupta and Chanakya moved to Patliputra, the capital and a historic learning center in the eastern Maghada kingdom of India. There they met Nanda according to Hindu sources, and Dhana Nanda according to Pali-language Buddhist sources.{{sfn|Mookerji|1966|pp=19\u201320}} Chandragupta became a commander of Nanda army, but according to the Roman records of Justin, Chandragupta (\"Sandrocottus\") offended the Nanda king (\"Nandrum\" or \"Nandrus\") because of which the king ordered him to be killed.{{sfn|Mookerji|1966|p=6}} An alternate version states that it was Chanakya who was publicly insulted by the Nanda king.{{sfn|Mookerji|1966|p=18}} Chandragupta and Chanakya escaped, and became rebels seeking to remove Nanda from power.{{sfn|Habib|Jha|2004|p=14}}{{refn|group=note|Some early printed editions of Justin's work wrongly mentioned \"Alexandrum\" instead of \"Nandrum\"; this error was corrected in philologist [[J.

Majumdar]] believed \"Alexandrum\" to be correct reading, and theorized that  Justin refers to a meeting between Chandragupta and [[Alexander the Great]] (\"Alexandrum\"). However, this is incorrect: research by historian [[Alfred von Gutschmid]] in the preceding century had clearly established that \"Nandrum\" is the correct reading supported by multiple manuscripts: only a single defective manuscript mentions \"Alexandrum\" in the margin.{{sfn|Trautmann|1970|pp=240-241}}}} The ''Mudrarakshasa'' also states that Chanakya swore to destroy the Nanda dynasty after he felt insulted by the king.{{sfn|Mookerji|1966|p=18}}\n\nThe Roman text by Justin mentions a couple of miraculous incidents involving Sandracottus (Chandragupta) and presents these legends as omens and portents of his destined greatness. In the first incident, when Chandragupta was asleep after having escaped from Nandrum, a big lion came up to him, licked him, and then left. In the second incident, when Chandragupta was readying for war with Alexander's generals, a huge wild elephant came to him, became tame, and offered himself to be his ride to the war.{{sfn|Mookerji|1966|p=32}}\n\n===Building the empire===\n{{Main|Conquest of the Nanda Empire|Maurya Empire}}\nAccording to the Buddhist text ''Mahavamsa Tika'', after the completion of Chandragupta's education at Taxila, he and Chanakya raised an army by recruiting soldiers from different places. Chanakya made Chandragupta the leader of this army.{{sfn|Mookerji|1966|p=22}} The Digambara Jain text ''Parishishtaparvan'' states that this army was raised by Chanakya with coins he minted, and by forming an alliance with Parvataka.<ref name=hc3>{{cite book|author1=Hemacandra|author2=R.C.C.

His main biographical sources in chronological order are:{{sfn|Mookerji|1988|pp=3-14}}\n*Greek and Roman sources, which are the oldest surviving records that mention Chandragupta or circumstances related to him; these include those by [[Nearchus]], [[Onesicritus]], [[Aristobulus of Cassandreia|Aristobulus]], [[Strabo]], [[Megasthenes]], [[Diodorus]], [[Arrian]], [[Pliny the Elder]], [[Plutarch]] and [[Justin (historian)|Justin]].\n*among the oldest dated Indian sources on Chandragupta are Hindu texts such as the [[Puranas]] and ''[[Arthashastra]]''; later composed Hindu sources include legends in [[Vishakhadatta]]'s ''[[Mudrarakshasa]]'', [[Somadeva]]'s ''[[Kathasaritsagara]]'' and [[Kshemendra]]'s ''[[Brihatkathamanjari]]''.\n*the earliest mentions of Chandragupta in Buddhist sources are those dated in 4th-century or after; these include the Sri Lankan Pali texts ''[[Dipavamsa]]'' (''rajavamsa'' section), ''[[Mahavamsa]]'', ''[[Mahavamsa tika]]'' and ''[[Mahabodhivamsa]]''.\n*the earliest sources that the Digambara Jain tradition state to be mentioning Chandragupta with Bhadrabahu appear in 7th\u2013 to 10th-century inscriptions at Sravana Belgola; this is disputed by scholars as well as the Svetambara Jain tradition;<ref name=\"Wiley2009p50\"/><ref name=\"Fleet1\"/> the first Digambara text interpreted to be mentioning the Maurya emperor are dated to about the 10th-century such as in the ''Brhatkathakosa'' of [[Harisena (Jain monk)|Harisena]], while the complete Jain legend about Chandragupta is found the 12th-century ''[[Parisishtaparvan]]'' by [[Hemachandra]].\n\nThe Greek and Roman texts, but for one exception, do not mention Chandragupta directly. They predominantly mention a mean and cruel king named Nanda, born to a queen after her affair with a barber, one who assassinated the king and came to power by a coup. Chandragupta later removed Nanda from power. The exception that does mention Chandragupta directly is the 2nd-century text by the Roman historian Justin. He states Chandragupta was of \u201chumble origin\u201d, then includes stories of miraculous legends associated with him, such as a wild elephant appearing and submitting itself as a ride to him before a war. The Justin version states Chandragupta and Chanakya defeated and removed the evil Nanda king.{{sfn|Mookerji|1988|pp=5-7}} The account of Megasthenes, as it has survived in Greek texts that quote him, states that Alexander the Great and Sandrocottos (Chandragupta) met, which if true would mean his rule started earlier than 321 BCE. He is described as a great king, but not as great in his power and reach as Porus in northwestern India or Agrammes (Dhana Nanda) in eastern India.<ref name=\"Singh2017p264\">{{cite book|author=Upinder Singh|title= Political Violence in Ancient India |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=t6A4DwAAQBAJ |year=2017| publisher= Harvard University Press|isbn= 978-0-674-97527-9|pages= 264\u2013265}}</ref>\n\nThe pre-4th century Brahmanical (Hindu) Puranic texts mostly mirror the Greek sources. These Hindu texts do not discuss the details of Chandragupta\u2019s ancestry, rather cover the ancestry of the Nanda king he unseated from the kingdom. The Nanda king is described as someone mean and cruel, persecuting people, as one against dharma and sastras, born out of an illicit relationship followed by coup.{{sfn|R. K. Mookerji|1966|pp=7\u20139}} The Chanakya\u2019s \u2018\u2019Arthasastra\u2019\u2019 refers to the Nanda rule as against the \u201cspiritual, cultural and military\u201d interests of the country, a period where intrigue and vice multiplied.{{sfn|R. K. Mookerji|1966|pp=7\u20139}} Chanakya states that Chandragupta returned dharma, nurtured a diversity of views, and a virtuous rule that kindled love among the subjects for his rule.{{sfn|R. K. Mookerji|1966|pp=7\u20139}}\n\nHindu sources are inconsistent. One medieval commentator states Chandragupta to be the son of one of the Nanda\u2019s wives with the name \u201cMura\u201d.{{sfn|R. K. Mookerji|1966|pp=7\u20139}} Another Sanskrit dramatic text ''[[Mudrarakshasa]]'' uses the terms \"Vrishala\" and \"Kula-hina\" to describe Chandragupta.{{sfn|R. K. Mookerji|1966|pp=9\u201311}}  The word \"Vrishala\u201d has two meanings, one the \"son of a [[Shudra]]\u201d, another meaning being the \"best of kings\". A later commentator used the former interpretation to posit that Chandragupta came from a Shudra background. However, historian R. K. Mookerji opposes this theory, and states that the word should be interpreted as \"the best of kings\u201d.{{sfn|R. K. Mookerji|1966|pp=9\u201311}} The same drama also refers to Chandragupta as someone of humble origin, in a manner similar to Justin.{{sfn|R. K. Mookerji|1966|pp=9\u201311}} According to the 11th-century texts of the Kashmiri Hindu tradition \u2013 ''[[Kathasaritsagara]]'' and ''Brihat-Katha-Manjari'' \u2013 the Nanda lineage was very short, of two competing Shudra power centers. Chandragupta was a son of Purva-Nanda, the older Nanda based in Ayodhya.{{sfn|Mookerji|1966|p=13}}{{sfn|Mookerji|1988|pp=15-18}}{{refn|group=note|According to Kaushik Roy, Chandragupta Maurya was a [[Shudra]] lineage king.{{sfn|Roy|2012|pp=61-62}}}} The most common theme in the Hindu sources is that Chandragupta came from a humble background and with Chanakya he emerged as a dharmic king loved by his subjects.{{sfn|R. K. Mookerji|1966|pp=7\u201313}}\n\nThe Buddhist texts such as ''[[Mahavamsa]]'' describe Chandragupta as of [[Kshatriya]] origin.{{sfn|Mookerji|1988|p=14}} These sources, written about seven centuries after his dynasty ended, state that both Chandragupta and his grandson Ashoka \u2013 the great patron of Buddhism, were of the same noble family of Sakyas from which the [[Buddha]] came, but one that branched off.{{sfn|Mookerji|1988|pp=13-15}} These Buddhist sources thus attempt to link the dynasty of their patron Ashoka directly to the Buddha \u2013 the founder of their faith.{{sfn|Thapar|1961|p=12}} The branching, claim these sources, occurred to escape the persecution of a cruel king from Kosala and Chandragupta\u2019s ancestors moved into a secluded Himalayan kingdom known for its peacocks. The Buddhist sources explain the epithet ''Moriya'' comes from these peacocks, or ''Mora'' in Pali (Sanskrit: Mayura).{{sfn|Mookerji|1988|pp=13-15}}<ref name=britchandrag/> The Buddhist texts are, however, also inconsistent. Some offer other legends to explain his epithet. For example, they mention a city named \"Moriya-nagara\" where all buildings were made of bricks colored like the peacock's resplendent neck.{{sfn|Mookerji|1988|pp=13-14}}  The ''Maha-bodhi-vamsa'' states he hailed from Moriya-nagara, while the ''Digha-Nikaya'' states he came from the Moriya clan of Pipphalivana.{{sfn|Mookerji|1966|p=14}} The Buddhist sources also mention that \u201cBrahmin Chanakya\u201d was his counselor and with whose support Chandragupta became the king at Patliputra.{{sfn|Mookerji|1988|pp=13-14}}\n\n[[File:7th-century Bhadrabahu Sanskrit inscription, Purvahale Kannada script, Shravanabelgola Karnataka.jpg|thumb|upright=1.65|7th-century Bhadrabahu inscription at Shravanabelagola (Sanskrit, Purvahale Kannada script).

[[Plutarch]] claims that he was a young man when he met [[Alexander the Great|Alexander]] during the [[Indian campaign of Alexander the Great|latter's invasion of India]] (c. 326-325 BCE). Assuming the Plutarch account is true, Raychaudhuri proposed in 1923 that Chandragupta may have been born after c. 350 BCE.{{sfn|Raychaudhuri|1923|p=142}} According to other Greco-Roman texts, Chandragupta attacked the Greek-Indian governors after Alexander's death (c. 323 CE) with [[Seleucus I Nicator]] entering into a treaty with Chandragupta years later.{{sfn|Raychaudhuri|1923|p=137}}  Seleucus Nicator, under this treaty, gave up Arachosia (Kandahar), Gedrosia (Makran) and Paropanisadai(Paropamisadae, Kabul) to Chandragupta, in exchange for 500 war elephants.<ref name=\"Singh2017p264\"/>\n\nThe texts do not include the start or end year of Chandragupta's reign.{{sfn|Raychaudhuri|1923|p=138}} According to some Hindu and the Buddhist texts, Chandragupta's ruled for 24 years.{{sfn|Thapar|1961|p=13}} The Buddhist sources state Chandragupta Maurya ruled 162 years after the death of the Buddha.{{sfn|Raychaudhuri|1967|pp=134\u2013142}} However, the birth and death of the Buddha varies by source and all these lead to a chronology that is significantly different than the Greek-Roman records. Similarly, Jain sources composed nearly 1,200 years after Chandragupta\u2019s death give different gap between Mahavira\u2019s death and his accession.{{sfn|Raychaudhuri|1967|pp=134\u2013142}} As with Buddha's death, the date of Mahavira's death itself is also a matter of debate, and the inconsistencies and lack of unanimity among the Jain authors casts doubt on Jain sources. This Digambara Jain chronology, in addition, is not reconcilable with the chronology implied in other Indian and non-Indian sources.{{sfn|Raychaudhuri|1967|pp=134\u2013142}}\n\nHistorians such as Irfan Habib and Vivekanand Jha assign Chandragupta's reign to c. 322-298 BCE.{{sfn|Habib|Jha|2004|p=15}} Upinder Singh dates his rule from 324 or 321 BCE to 297 BCE.{{sfn|Singh|2016|p=331}} Kristi Wiley states he reigned between 320 and 293 BCE.<ref name=\"Wiley2009p50\"/>\n\n=== Early life ===\n\nThe early life of Chandragupta Maurya is unclear and varies by source. According to the Sinhalese Buddhist tradition, Chandragupta's father - who was the chief of the Moriya clan - was killed in a battle, when his mother was pregnant. His mother escaped to the Puppha-pura (Pushpa-pura, literally \"flower city\", Patliputra) city with the help of her brothers. For Chandragupta safety, his maternal uncles helped a cattle-raising family adopt him as a baby. He was brought up by a [[cowman (profession)|cowherd]]. When Chandragupta grew up, the cowherd sold him to a hunter, who employed him to tend cattle.{{sfn|Mookerji|1966|p=16}}{{sfn|Raychaudhuri|1967|p=143}}\n\nAccording to the Digambara legend by Hemachandra, Chanakya was a Jain layperson and a Brahmin. When Chanakya was born, Jain monks prophesied that Chanakya will one day grow up to help make someone an emperor and will be the power behind the throne.{{sfn|Mookerji|1966|p=6}}<ref name=\"Hemacandra1998\"/> Chanakya believed in the prophecy. He began making it true by agreeing to help the daughter of the chief of a peacock breeding community to deliver a baby boy. In exchange, for his fee, he asked the mother to give up the boy and let him adopt him at a later date.{{sfn|Mookerji|1966|p=14}}<ref name=\"Hemacandra1998\"/> The Jain Brahmin then went about making money through magic, and returned later to claim boy Chandragupta.<ref name=\"Hemacandra1998\"/> He taught and trained him. Together, they recruited soldiers and began their violent attack of the local kingdom. First they failed, but later through alliances, they won the Nanda kingdom and proclaimed Patliputra as their capital.<ref name=\"Hemacandra1998\"/>\n\n==Career==\n=== Influence of Chanakya (Kautilya) ===\n[[File:Chanakya artistic depiction.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|left|alt=Chanakya|Chandragupta's [[guru]] was Chanakya, with whom he studied as a child and with whose counsel he built the Empire. This image is a 1915 artistic portrait of Chanakya.]]\n\nThe Buddhist and Hindu sources present different versions of how Chandragupta met Chanakya. Broadly, they mention boy Chandragupta created a mock game of a royal court wherein his cowherd friends and he played. Chanakya saw the boy making decisions, approached the hunter, paid him off and adopted Chandragupta.{{sfn|Mookerji|1966|pp=15\u201317}} He took the young Chandragupta, taught him, and then admitted him in Taxila to study the Vedas, military arts, law and other sastras.{{sfn|Mookerji|1966|pp=15\u201317}}\n\nAfter Taxila, Chandragupta and Chanakya moved to Patliputra, the capital and a historic learning center in the eastern Maghada kingdom of India. There they met Nanda according to Hindu sources, and Dhana Nanda according to Pali-language Buddhist sources.{{sfn|Mookerji|1966|pp=19\u201320}} Chandragupta became a commander of Nanda army, but according to the Roman records of Justin, Chandragupta (\"Sandrocottus\") offended the Nanda king (\"Nandrum\" or \"Nandrus\") because of which the king ordered him to be killed.{{sfn|Mookerji|1966|p=6}} An alternate version states that it was Chanakya who was publicly insulted by the Nanda king.{{sfn|Mookerji|1966|p=18}} Chandragupta and Chanakya escaped, and became rebels seeking to remove Nanda from power.{{sfn|Habib|Jha|2004|p=14}}{{refn|group=note|Some early printed editions of Justin's work wrongly mentioned \"Alexandrum\" instead of \"Nandrum\"; this error was corrected in philologist [[J.

Majumdar]] believed \"Alexandrum\" to be correct reading, and theorized that  Justin refers to a meeting between Chandragupta and [[Alexander the Great]] (\"Alexandrum\"). However, this is incorrect: research by historian [[Alfred von Gutschmid]] in the preceding century had clearly established that \"Nandrum\" is the correct reading supported by multiple manuscripts: only a single defective manuscript mentions \"Alexandrum\" in the margin.{{sfn|Trautmann|1970|pp=240-241}}}} The ''Mudrarakshasa'' also states that Chanakya swore to destroy the Nanda dynasty after he felt insulted by the king.{{sfn|Mookerji|1966|p=18}}\n\nThe Roman text by Justin mentions a couple of miraculous incidents involving Sandracottus (Chandragupta) and presents these legends as omens and portents of his destined greatness. In the first incident, when Chandragupta was asleep after having escaped from Nandrum, a big lion came up to him, licked him, and then left. In the second incident, when Chandragupta was readying for war with Alexander's generals, a huge wild elephant came to him, became tame, and offered himself to be his ride to the war.{{sfn|Mookerji|1966|p=32}}\n\n===Building the empire===\n{{Main|Conquest of the Nanda Empire|Maurya Empire}}\nAccording to the Buddhist text ''Mahavamsa Tika'', after the completion of Chandragupta's education at Taxila, he and Chanakya raised an army by recruiting soldiers from different places.

Bhadrabahu led a migration of Jain monks to south India. Chandragupta Maurya joined him as a monk, after renouncing his kingdom and handing over the power to his son Bindusara. Together, states a Digambara legend, Chandragupta and Bhadrabahu moved to Shravanabelagola, in present-day south Karnataka.{{sfn|Habib|Jha|2004|p=20}} These Jain accounts were written more than 1,200 years after Chandragupta Maurya's death, and appear in texts such as ''Brihakath\u0101 ko\u015ba'' (931 CE) of Harishena, ''Bhadrab\u0101hu charita'' (1450 CE) of Ratnanandi, ''Muniva\u1e43sa bhyudaya'' (1680 CE) and ''Rajavali kathe''.{{sfn|Mookerji|1966|pp=39\u201340}}{{sfn|Samuel|2010|pp=60}}{{sfn|Thapar|2004|p=178}} He lived as an ascetic at [[Shravanabelagola]] for several years before fasting to death as per the Jain practice of ''[[sallekhana]]'', according to this Digambara legend.{{sfn|Mookerji|1966|pp=39\u201341, 60\u201364}}{{sfn|Jones|Ryan|2006|p=xxviii}}<ref>Jerry Bentley (1993), ''Old World Encounters: Cross-Cultural Contacts and Exchanges in Pre-Modern Times'', Oxford University Press, pages 44\u201346</ref>\n\nAlong with texts, several Digambara Jain inscriptions dating from the 7th\u201315th century refer to Bhadrabahu and a Prabhacandra or Samprati Chandragupta together. These inscriptions are inconsistent. Later Digambara tradition identified the Prabhacandra as Chandragupta, and some modern era scholars have accepted this Digambara tradition while others consider it as incorrect, a cherrypicking of the Jain legends to suit a prejudiced version, and misindentification of different individuals with same names: Bhadrabahu, Prabhacandra and Chandragupta.<ref name=\"Dikshitar1993p264\"/><ref name=\"Wiley2009p50\"/><ref name=\"Fleet1\"/> Several of the late Digambara inscriptions and texts in Karnataka state the migration started from Ujjain and not Patliputra (as stated in some Digambara texts). In the epigraphical versions, Bhadrabahu never came to Shravanabelagola and he died near Ujjain. Before his own death, he sent other Jain monks to south India.<ref name=\"Wiley2009p50\"/><ref name=\"Fleet1\"/>\n\nAccording to [[Jeffery D. Long]] \u2013 a scholar of Jain and Hindu studies, in one Digambara version, it was Samprati Chandragupta who renounced, migrated and committed ''sallekhana'' in Shravanabelagola. Scholars attribute the disintegration of Maurya empire to the times and actions of Samprati Chandragupta \u2013 the grandson of Ashoka and great-great-grandson of Chandragupta Maurya, states Long. The two Chandraguptas have been confused to be the same in some Digambara legends.<ref name=\"Long2013\">{{cite book|author=Jeffery D Long|title=Jainism: An Introduction|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=I3gAAwAAQBAJ  |date=2013 |publisher=I.B.Tauris |isbn=978-0-85771-392-6|pages=60\u201361}}</ref>\n\nAccording to [[V. R. Ramachandra Dikshitar]] \u2013 an Indologist and historian, several of the Digambara legends mention Prabhacandra, which has been misidentified as Chandragupta Maurya particularly after the original publication on Shravanabelagola epigraphy by [[B. Lewis Rice]]. The earliest and most important inscriptions mention Prabhacandra, which Lewis Rice presumed may have been the \"clerical name assumed by Chadragupta Maurya\" after he renounced and moved with Bhadrabahu from Patliputra. Dikshitar states there is no evidence in support of this, and the Digambara history provides evidence against this hypothesis. Prabhacandra was an important Jain monk scholar in his own right and one who migrated centuries after Chandragupta Maurya's death.<ref name=\"Dikshitar1993p264\"/> [[John Faithfull Fleet|John F Fleet]], an Indologist and epigraphist, concurs with Dikshitar and states Lewis Rice's interpretation and analysis of Shravanabelagola inscriptions were wrong and ahistorical.<ref name=\"Fleet1\"/> Other scholars have taken Lewis Rice's proposal of Chandragupta Maurya retiring and dying in Shravanabelagola as the working hypothesis, since no alternate historical information or evidence is available about Chandragupta's final years and death.<ref name=\"Dikshitar1993p264\"/>\n\nAccording to [[Paul Dundas]] \u2013 a scholar of Jain studies and Sanskrit, the Svetambara tradition of Jainism disputes the Digambara legends of antiquity. According to a 5th-century text of the Svetambara Jains, the Digambara sect of Jainism arose only 609 years after Mahavira's death, or in the 1st-century CE.<ref name=\"Dundas2003p46\">{{cite book|author=Paul Dundas|title=The Jains| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=X8iAAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA46 |year= 2003| publisher= Routledge| isbn=978-0-415-26605-5|pages=46\u201349}}</ref> To Svetambara's version of Jain history, Digambaras responded with their own versions and legends after the 5th-century, with their first expanded Digambara version of sectarian split within Jainism appearing in the 10th-century.<ref name=\"Dundas2003p46\"/> According to Svetambaras, the 3rd-century BCE Bhadrabahu was based near Nepalese foothills of the Himalayas, who neither moved nor travelled with Chandragupta Maurya to the south, rather he died near Patliputra.

The Hemachandra version includes incredible stories about Jain monks who could become invisible to steal food from royal storage, the Jain Brahmin Chanakya using violence and cunning tactics to expand Chandragupta\u2019s kingdom and increase royal revenues.<ref name=\"Hemacandra1998\"/> It states in verses 8.415 to 8.435, that for 15 years as king, Chandragupta was follower of \"ascetics with the wrong view of religion\" (non-Jain), ascetics who \"lusted for women\". Chanakya persuaded Chandragupta to convert to Jainism by showing Jain ascetics avoided women and focused on their religion.<ref name=\"Hemacandra1998\"/> The legend mentions Chanakya aiding the premature birth of Bindusara \u2013 the son Chandragupta and his dying queen,<ref name=\"Hemacandra1998\"/> but makes no mention of Chandragupta\u2019s migration or ''sallekhana'' (voluntary fasting to death).  It states in verse 8.444 that \"Chandragupta died in meditation and went to heaven\".<ref name=hc2/> According to the Hemachandra\u2019s legend, it was Chanakya who committed ''sallekhana'' by first fasting and then burning himself on a dungheap in a motionless posture, and was \"reborn as a Jain goddess in that place\".<ref name=hc2>{{cite book|author1=Hemacandra|author2=R.C.C.
