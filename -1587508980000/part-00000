In human [[diploid]] cells, 6 billion DNA base pairs of the genome can be found in the nucleus. The development of all cancers starts with a single cell accumulating enough harmful changes in DNA sequence that allow it to proliferate uncontrollably.

The majority of somatic mutations are mere byproducts of the unstable cancer genome and do not enhance the tumour cell growth. Usually, between two and eight driver mutations, mutations that gives cancer cells growth advantages, are found amongst all the somatic mutations a tumour sample.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Vogelstein B, Papadopoulos N, Velculescu VE, Zhou S, Diaz LA, Kinzler KW | title = Cancer genome landscapes | journal = Science | volume = 339 | issue = 6127 | pages = 1546\u201358 | date = March 2013 | pmid = 23539594 | pmc = 3749880 | doi = 10.1126/science.1235122 | bibcode = 2013Sci...339.1546V }}</ref> Driver mutations may be actionable as they serve as [[Diagnosis|diagnostic]] and [[Prognosis|prognostic]] biomarkers for cancer, and may have therapeutic implications.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Kotelnikova EA, Pyatnitskiy M, Paleeva A, Kremenetskaya O, Vinogradov D | title = Practical aspects of NGS-based pathways analysis for personalized cancer science and medicine | journal = Oncotarget | volume = 7 | issue = 32 | pages = 52493\u201352516 | date = August 2016 | pmid = 27191992 | pmc = 5239569 | doi = 10.18632/oncotarget.9370 }}</ref> For instance, [[Protein kinase inhibitor|kinase inhibitors]] can be treating tumours associated with driver mutations in kinases.

To provide and develop the most appropriate genetic therapy for one's cancer, personalized oncogenomics has been developed. By sequencing a cancer patient's genome, a clinical scientist can better understand which genes/part of the genome have been mutated specifically in that patient and a personalized treatment plan can potentially be implemented.\n\n== Methods ==\n\n=== Whole Genome Analysis ===\n\u00a0 With the advent of next-generation sequencing, the genome-wide sequencing analyses have been made more accessible to thoroughly understand the genetics of each patient's cancer. Genetic material from tumour biopsies can be analyzed by two genome-wide approaches: [[Exome sequencing|whole exome sequencing]] (WES) and [[whole genome sequencing]] (WGS). By developing tools to analyze these extensive sequence data, scientists have begun to comprehend how diseases, including cancer, can be attributed by genes and intergenic variants such as [[Single-nucleotide polymorphism|single nucleotide polymorphisms]] (SNPs) and [[Copy-number variation|copy number variants]] (CNVs).\n\nAlthough more expensive than WES, whole genome sequencing allows clinical scientists to understand how cancer can be caused by alterations in a genome including single nucleotide variants (SNVs), SNPs and CNVs.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Tremblay J, Hamet P | title = Role of genomics on the path to personalized medicine | journal = Metabolism | volume = 62 Suppl 1 | pages = S2-5 | date = January 2013 | pmid = 23021037 | doi = 10.1016/j.metabol.2012.08.023 }}</ref> Since WES samples only the [[exome]] (the collection of known [[coding region]]s of the genome) alterations in the [[Non-coding DNA|non-coding region]] of the genome will not be detected by WES.

In human [[diploid]] cells, 6 billion DNA base pairs of the genome can be found in the nucleus. The development of all cancers starts with a single cell accumulating enough harmful changes in DNA sequence that allow it to proliferate uncontrollably.

To provide and develop the most appropriate genetic therapy for one's cancer, personalized oncogenomics has been developed. By sequencing a cancer patient's genome, a clinical scientist can better understand which genes/part of the genome have been mutated specifically in that patient and a personalized treatment plan can potentially be implemented.\n\n== Methods ==\n\n=== Whole Genome Analysis ===\n\u00a0 With the advent of next-generation sequencing, the genome-wide sequencing analyses have been made more accessible to thoroughly understand the genetics of each patient's cancer.

By developing tools to analyze these extensive sequence data, scientists have begun to comprehend how diseases, including cancer, can be attributed by genes and intergenic variants such as [[Single-nucleotide polymorphism|single nucleotide polymorphisms]] (SNPs) and [[Copy-number variation|copy number variants]] (CNVs).\n\nAlthough more expensive than WES, whole genome sequencing allows clinical scientists to understand how cancer can be caused by alterations in a genome including single nucleotide variants (SNVs), SNPs and CNVs.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Tremblay J, Hamet P | title = Role of genomics on the path to personalized medicine | journal = Metabolism | volume = 62 Suppl 1 | pages = S2-5 | date = January 2013 | pmid = 23021037 | doi = 10.1016/j.metabol.2012.08.023 }}</ref> Since WES samples only the [[exome]] (the collection of known [[coding region]]s of the genome) alterations in the [[Non-coding DNA|non-coding region]] of the genome will not be detected by WES.

[[Iroquois]] people occasionally fought the Lenape. Surviving Lenape moved west into the upper [[Ohio River]] basin. The [[American Revolutionary War]] and United States' independence pushed them further west. In the 1860s, the United States government sent most Lenape remaining in the [[eastern United States]] to the [[Indian Territory]] (present-day Oklahoma and surrounding territory) under the [[Indian removal]] policy. In the 21st century, most Lenape reside in [[Oklahoma]], with some communities living also in [[Wisconsin]], [[Ontario]] (Canada), and in their traditional homelands.\n\nEuropeans came to the [[Delaware Valley]] in the early 17th century, with the first settlements founded by the Dutch, who in 1623 built [[Fort Nassau (South River)|Fort Nassau]] on the Delaware River opposite the [[Schuylkill River]] in what is now [[Brooklawn, New Jersey]]. The Dutch considered the entire Delaware River valley to be part of their [[New Netherland]] colony. In 1638, [[Sweden|Swedish]] settlers led by renegade Dutch established the colony of [[New Sweden]] at [[Fort Christina]] (present-day [[Wilmington, Delaware]]) and quickly spread out in the valley. In 1644, New Sweden supported the [[Susquehannock]]s in their military defeat of the English colony of [[Maryland]]. In 1648, the Dutch built [[Fort Beversreede]] on the west bank of the Delaware, south of the Schuylkill near the present-day [[Eastwick, Philadelphia|Eastwick]] neighborhood, to reassert their dominion over the area. The Swedes responded by building [[New Sweden#Forts|Fort Nya Korsholm]], or New [[Korsholm]], named after a town in [[Finland]] with a Swedish majority. In 1655, a Dutch military campaign led by New Netherland Director-General [[Peter Stuyvesant]] took control of the Swedish colony, ending its claim to independence. The Swedish and Finnish settlers continued to have their own militia, religion, and court, and to enjoy substantial autonomy under the Dutch. The English conquered the New Netherland colony in 1664, though the situation did not change substantially until 1682 when the area was included in [[William Penn]]'s charter for Pennsylvania.\n\nIn 1681, in partial repayment of a debt, [[Charles II of England]] granted Penn a [[charter]] for what would become the [[Province of Pennsylvania|Pennsylvania colony]]. Despite the royal charter, Penn bought the land from the local Lenape to be on good terms with the Native Americans and ensure peace for his colony.<ref>{{Cite book\n |last=Brookes\n |first=Karin\n |author2=John Gattuso, Lou Harry, Edward Jardim, Donald Kraybill, Susan Lewis, Dave Nelson and Carol Turkington\n |editor=Zo\u00eb Ross\n |title=Insight Guides: Philadelphia and Surroundings\n |edition=Second Edition (Updated)\n |year=2005\n |publisher=APA Publications\n |page=[https://archive.org/details/insightguidephil00zoer/page/21 21]\n |isbn=1-58573-026-2\n |url=https://archive.org/details/insightguidephil00zoer/page/21\n }}</ref> Penn made a treaty of friendship with Lenape chief [[Tamanend|Tammany]] under an elm tree at [[Shackamaxon]], in what is now the city's [[Fishtown, Philadelphia|Fishtown]] neighborhood.<ref name=weigley>{{Cite book |author          = Weigley RF (eds)\n |title           = Philadelphia: A 300-Year History\n |publisher       = [[W.

Hoping that Philadelphia would become more like an English rural town instead of a city, Penn laid out roads on a [[grid plan]] to keep houses and businesses spread far apart, with areas for gardens and [[orchard]]s. The city's inhabitants did not follow Penn's plans, however, as they crowded by the Delaware River port, and subdivided and resold their lots.<ref>''Philadelphia: A 300-Year History'', pages 7, 14 \u2013 16</ref> Before Penn left Philadelphia for the last time, he issued the Charter of 1701 establishing it as a city.

[[Benjamin Franklin]], a leading citizen, helped improve city services and founded new ones, such as fire protection, a library, and one of the American colonies' first hospitals.\n\nA number of philosophical societies were formed, which were centers of the city's intellectual life: the Philadelphia Society for Promoting Agriculture (1785), the Pennsylvania Society for the Encouragement of Manufactures and the Useful Arts (1787), the [[Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia|Academy of Natural Sciences]] (1812), and the [[Franklin Institute]] (1824).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://explorepahistory.com/story.php?storyId=35&chapter=2 |title=Explore PA History website |publisher=Explorepahistory.com |accessdate=December 23, 2010}}</ref> These societies developed and financed new industries, attracting skilled and knowledgeable immigrants from Europe.\n\n[[File:1752 ( 1850 ) Scull ^ Heap Map of Philadelphia ^ Environs (first view of Phillidelphia State House) - Geographicus - Philadelphia-sculllobach-1850.jpg|thumb|left|upright|An 18th-century map of Philadelphia, circa 1752]]\nPhiladelphia's importance and central location in the colonies made it a natural center for [[American Revolution|America's revolutionaries]].

[[Iroquois]] people occasionally fought the Lenape. Surviving Lenape moved west into the upper [[Ohio River]] basin. The [[American Revolutionary War]] and United States' independence pushed them further west. In the 1860s, the United States government sent most Lenape remaining in the [[eastern United States]] to the [[Indian Territory]] (present-day Oklahoma and surrounding territory) under the [[Indian removal]] policy. In the 21st century, most Lenape reside in [[Oklahoma]], with some communities living also in [[Wisconsin]], [[Ontario]] (Canada), and in their traditional homelands.\n\nEuropeans came to the [[Delaware Valley]] in the early 17th century, with the first settlements founded by the Dutch, who in 1623 built [[Fort Nassau (South River)|Fort Nassau]] on the Delaware River opposite the [[Schuylkill River]] in what is now [[Brooklawn, New Jersey]]. The Dutch considered the entire Delaware River valley to be part of their [[New Netherland]] colony. In 1638, [[Sweden|Swedish]] settlers led by renegade Dutch established the colony of [[New Sweden]] at [[Fort Christina]] (present-day [[Wilmington, Delaware]]) and quickly spread out in the valley. In 1644, New Sweden supported the [[Susquehannock]]s in their military defeat of the English colony of [[Maryland]]. In 1648, the Dutch built [[Fort Beversreede]] on the west bank of the Delaware, south of the Schuylkill near the present-day [[Eastwick, Philadelphia|Eastwick]] neighborhood, to reassert their dominion over the area. The Swedes responded by building [[New Sweden#Forts|Fort Nya Korsholm]], or New [[Korsholm]], named after a town in [[Finland]] with a Swedish majority. In 1655, a Dutch military campaign led by New Netherland Director-General [[Peter Stuyvesant]] took control of the Swedish colony, ending its claim to independence. The Swedish and Finnish settlers continued to have their own militia, religion, and court, and to enjoy substantial autonomy under the Dutch. The English conquered the New Netherland colony in 1664, though the situation did not change substantially until 1682 when the area was included in [[William Penn]]'s charter for Pennsylvania.\n\nIn 1681, in partial repayment of a debt, [[Charles II of England]] granted Penn a [[charter]] for what would become the [[Province of Pennsylvania|Pennsylvania colony]]. Despite the royal charter, Penn bought the land from the local Lenape to be on good terms with the Native Americans and ensure peace for his colony.<ref>{{Cite book\n |last=Brookes\n |first=Karin\n |author2=John Gattuso, Lou Harry, Edward Jardim, Donald Kraybill, Susan Lewis, Dave Nelson and Carol Turkington\n |editor=Zo\u00eb Ross\n |title=Insight Guides: Philadelphia and Surroundings\n |edition=Second Edition (Updated)\n |year=2005\n |publisher=APA Publications\n |page=[https://archive.org/details/insightguidephil00zoer/page/21 21]\n |isbn=1-58573-026-2\n |url=https://archive.org/details/insightguidephil00zoer/page/21\n }}</ref> Penn made a treaty of friendship with Lenape chief [[Tamanend|Tammany]] under an elm tree at [[Shackamaxon]], in what is now the city's [[Fishtown, Philadelphia|Fishtown]] neighborhood.<ref name=weigley>{{Cite book |author          = Weigley RF (eds)\n |title           = Philadelphia: A 300-Year History\n |publisher       = [[W.

Hoping that Philadelphia would become more like an English rural town instead of a city, Penn laid out roads on a [[grid plan]] to keep houses and businesses spread far apart, with areas for gardens and [[orchard]]s. The city's inhabitants did not follow Penn's plans, however, as they crowded by the Delaware River port, and subdivided and resold their lots.<ref>''Philadelphia: A 300-Year History'', pages 7, 14 \u2013 16</ref> Before Penn left Philadelphia for the last time, he issued the Charter of 1701 establishing it as a city.

[[Benjamin Franklin]], a leading citizen, helped improve city services and founded new ones, such as fire protection, a library, and one of the American colonies' first hospitals.\n\nA number of philosophical societies were formed, which were centers of the city's intellectual life: the Philadelphia Society for Promoting Agriculture (1785), the Pennsylvania Society for the Encouragement of Manufactures and the Useful Arts (1787), the [[Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia|Academy of Natural Sciences]] (1812), and the [[Franklin Institute]] (1824).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://explorepahistory.com/story.php?storyId=35&chapter=2 |title=Explore PA History website |publisher=Explorepahistory.com |accessdate=December 23, 2010}}</ref> These societies developed and financed new industries, attracting skilled and knowledgeable immigrants from Europe.\n\n[[File:1752 ( 1850 ) Scull ^ Heap Map of Philadelphia ^ Environs (first view of Phillidelphia State House) - Geographicus - Philadelphia-sculllobach-1850.jpg|thumb|left|upright|An 18th-century map of Philadelphia, circa 1752]]\nPhiladelphia's importance and central location in the colonies made it a natural center for [[American Revolution|America's revolutionaries]].

The free black community also established many schools for its children, with the help of Quakers. [[New York City]] surpassed Philadelphia in population by 1790.

The car was originally painted a very dark blue, almost black.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nImmediately following completion of the first Nembo spyder, a Nembo coupe was constructed using a 1959 250 GT PF Coupe donor (chassis 1623GT). The aluminum [[notchback]] body somewhat resembled a 1964 250 GTO, due in part to using a windshield from this model. The body was primarily designed by Neri and Bonacini, rather than Meade, as Meade disagreed with the shop over their preference for a notchback body instead of his design for a [[fastback]]. The completed car was originally painted red, very close to the standard Ferrari color \"Rosso Chiaro.\" <ref name=\":2\" /><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.barchetta.cc/english/All.Ferraris/Detail/1623GT.250GT.Coupe.htm|title=Detail - 250 GT Coupe rebodied as Nembo 1623GT|website=www.barchetta.cc|access-date=2018-09-19}}</ref>\n\nThe second Nembo spyder was built during 1967-68, based on a wrecked [[Ferrari 250 GT SWB|250 GT SWB]] (chassis 3771GT). This car was commissioned by Bill Dixon, who asked Tom Meade to replicate the appearance of the first Nembo sypder. The body was again built by Neri and Bonacini, although the two ended their business partnership while the car was in progress. Although designed similarly to the first Nembo spyder, there were differences in body work mandated by the shorter wheelbase of the donor chassis. A removable hardtop was also provided. Meade equipped the car with then-new [[Weber carburetor|Weber]] 40 DCN carburetors, which required significant tweaking to run well for street use. This car was originally painted in a dark burgundy color.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite journal|last=Sonnery|first=Marc|date=1998-05-09|title=The Nembo Ferraris - Part II|url=|journal=Ferrari Market Letter|volume=23|issue=10|pages=1\u20134|via=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.barchetta.cc/english/All.Ferraris/Detail/3771GT.250GT.htm|title=250 GT s/n 3771GT|website=www.barchetta.cc|access-date=2018-09-19}}</ref>\n\nFabrication of a third Nembo spyder was begun concurrently with the second one. It was based on a 250 GTE 2+2 chassis (number 2707GT). The body of this car differed from previous Nembo spyders, with a \"sharknose\" like the [[Ferrari 156 F1|156 F1]] and a rounded tail like the 250 GT SWB. This car was ordered by a customer in [[Lebanon]] through a dealer in [[Paris]]. The car was never completed but was shipped to Lebanon as an unfinished body and chassis at the request of the dealer.<ref name=\":3\" /><ref name=\":6\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.barchetta.cc/english/All.Ferraris/Detail/2707GT.250GTE.htm|title=Detail - 250 GTE s/n 2707GT|website=www.barchetta.cc|access-date=2018-09-19}}</ref> Ferrari Classiche has confirmed the authenticity of the 2707GT in 2019 and had added a \"Classiche\" stamp to the chassis, to clearly differentiate it from other replicas (one of such replicas is supposedly a Drogo).

The project was finally completed in 1998 and is sometimes considered another Nembo spyder.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://drive-my.com/en/test-drive/item/2495-1964-ferrari-330gt-nembo-spyder-road-test.html|title=1964 Ferrari 330GT Nembo Spyder road test|last=Thorne|first=Malcolm|date=2017-02-11|work=Drive|access-date=2018-09-11|language=en-gb}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.barchetta.cc/english/All.Ferraris/Detail/5805GT.330.GT.htm|title=Detail - 330 GT 5805GT|website=www.barchetta.cc|access-date=2018-09-19}}</ref>\n\n===Lamborghini and the 400GT Monza===\n\n[[File:1966 Lamborghini 400 GT Monza.jpg|thumb|1966 Lamborghini 400 GT Monza]]\n{{Main|Lamborghini 400GT Monza}}\nNeri and Bonacini were contracted by Lamborghini in 1963 to build the chassis for the first Lamborghini prototype, the [[Lamborghini 350GTV|350 GTV]].<ref name=\":2\" /> This chassis was constructed from square and round section steel tubing and was relatively light and rigid by contemporary standards.<ref name=\":32\" /> Once Lamborghini began series production of the [[Lamborghini 350 GT|350 GT]], Neri and Bonacini continued to supply chassis, which were then bodied by [[Carrozzeria Touring]].

Possibly built for an unknown American client to race at the [[24 Hours of Le Mans]], the car was completed in August 1966<ref name=\":32\" /> and named the 400 GT Monza. The aluminum body was hand built in the Neri and Bonacini shop and went through many revisions during the fabrication process.<ref name=\":5\" /> The final result shows visual similarities to other Italian sports cars such as the [[Bizzarrini Strada|Bizzarrini 5300 GT]] and the [[Lamborghini Miura]], with a long hood and [[Kammback|Kamm tail]].<ref name=\":1\" /><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.classicandperformancecar.com/features/octane_features/261562/lamborghini_monza.html|title=Octane {{!}} Lamborghini 400GT Monza|last=Adams|first=Keith|date=2011-01-01|website=Octane|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140810090558/http://www.classicandperformancecar.com/features/octane_features/261562/lamborghini_monza.html|archive-date=2014-08-10|url-status=dead|access-date=2018-09-19}}</ref>\n\nThe 400 GT Monza never raced at Le Mans, possibly due to [[Homologation (motorsport)|homologation]] problems. It was displayed at the 1967 [[Automobile Barcelona|Barcelona Motor Show]] on the Lamborghini importer Amato's stand. A wealthy Spaniard purchased it at the show and the 400GT Monza remained in his family until 2005, when it was sold at Bonhams' December 2005 auction in London for \u00a3177,500 GBP.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n=== Studio GT Due Litri ===\n{{Multiple image\n| align = \n| direction = \n| total_width = \n| image1 = 1968 Neri & Bonacini Studio GT Due Litri left front.jpg\n| alt1 = 1968 Neri and Bonacini Studio GT Due Litre front view\n| caption1 = 1968 Studio GT Due Litre front view\n| image2 = 1968 Neri & Bonacini Studio GT Due Litri rear.jpg\n| caption2 = 1968 Studio GT Due Litre rear view\n| alt2 = 1968 Neri and Bonacini Studio GT Due Litre rear view\n}}\nIn 1966, Neri and Bonacini decided to produce a road car under their own name.

Wheelbase measured 92 inches, overall height was 42 inches, and track was 53 inches at the front and 52.5 at the rear. As the Studio GT was intended to be a [[grand tourer]], it had a fully trimmed and soundproofed interior. The body was a compact and sleek [[fastback]], with pop-up headlights on the final version and rear bodywork visually similar to that of the [[Lamborghini Miura]]. The car was designed around a 1.8 litre [[Lancia Flavia]] [[Flat engine|flat-4 engine]], but a [[Ford Taunus]] V4 and [[Automobili Turismo e Sport|an ATS]] [[V8 engine]] were also installed in prototypes for testing purposes as availability of the Lancia engine for series production was uncertain.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":4\" />\n\nNeri and Bonacini produced two prototypes between 1966 and 1968. During this period their partnership ended and Giorgio Neri independently searched for an investor interested in purchasing the second prototype and all tooling and designs for production purposes.

It is a blend of Spanish and English [[lexical item]]s and [[grammar]]. Spanglish can be considered a variety of Spanish with heavy use of English or vice versa.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}} It can be more related either to Spanish or to English, depending on the circumstances. Since Spanglish arises independently in each region, it reflects the locally spoken varieties of English and Spanish. In general different varieties of Spanglish are not necessarily mutually intelligible. In Mexican and Chicano Spanish the common term for \"Spanglish\" is \"Pocho\".<ref name=\"D'Amore2009\">{{cite book|last= D'Amore|first=Anna Maria|title=Translating Contemporary Mexican Texts: Fidelity to Alterity|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1hLCm7MH7u8C&pg=PA79|year=2009|publisher=Peter Lang|location=New York|isbn=978-1-4331-0499-2|page=79}}</ref>\n\nThe term ''Spanglish'' is first recorded in 1933.<ref name=\"auto\">Lambert, James. 2018.

Between 1902 and 1948, the main language of instruction in public schools (used for all subjects except foreign language courses) was English. Currently Puerto Rico is nearly unique in having both English and Spanish as its official languages<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Nash|first1=Rose|title=Spanglish: Language Contact in Puerto Rico|journal=American Speech|volume=45|issue=3/4|pages=223\u2013233|doi=10.2307/454837|jstor=454837|year=1970}}</ref> (but see also [[New Mexico#Official language|New Mexico]]). Consequently, many American English words are now found in the vocabulary of Puerto Rican Spanish. ''Spanglish'' may also be known by different regional names.\n\nSpanglish does not have one unified dialect\u2014specifically, the varieties of Spanglish spoken in New York, Florida, Texas, and California differ. Monolingual speakers of standard Spanish may have difficulty in understanding it.<ref>Ardila 2005, pg. 61.</ref>\nIt is common in Panama, where the 96-year (1903\u20131999) U.S. control of the [[Panama Canal]] influenced much of local society, especially among the former residents of the [[Panama Canal Zone]], the [[Zonian]]s.\n\nMany Puerto Ricans living on the island of [[St. Croix]] speak in informal situations a unique Spanglish-like combination of [[Puerto Rican Spanish]] and the local [[Virgin Islands Creole|Crucian dialect of Virgin Islands Creole English]], which is very different from the Spanglish spoken elsewhere. A similar situation exists in the large Puerto Rican-descended populations of New York City and Boston.\n\nSpanglish is spoken commonly in the modern United States, reflecting the growth of the Hispanic-American population due to immigration. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the population of Hispanics grew from 35.3 million to 53 million between 2000 and 2012.<ref name=\"Guzman, B. 2000 & US Census 2012\">Guzman, B. 2000 & US Census 2012</ref> Hispanics have become the largest minority ethnic group in the US.  More than 60% are of Mexican descent. Mexican Americans form one of the fastest-growing groups, increasing from 20.6 million to 34.5 million between 2000 and 2012.<ref name=\"Guzman, B. 2000 & US Census 2012\"/> Around 58% of this community chose California, especially Southern California, as their new home. Spanglish is widely used throughout the heavily Mexican-American and other Hispanic communities of Southern California.<ref name=\"Rothman, Jason pg. 1\">Rothman, Jason & Rell, Amy Beth, pg. 1</ref>\nThe use of Spanglish has become important to Hispanic communities throughout the United States in areas such as Miami, New York City, Texas, and California. In Miami, the [[Afro-Cuban]] community makes use of a Spanglish familiarly known as \"[[Cubonics]],\" a portmanteau of the words ''Cuban'' and ''Ebonics'', a slang term for [[African American Vernacular English]] that is itself a portmanteau of ''Ebony'' and ''phonics''.\"<ref name=\"Rothman, Jason pg. 1\"/>\n\nSpanglish is known as bilingualism/''semi-lingualism.'' The acquisition of the first language is interrupted or unstructured language input follows from the second language. This can also happen in reverse.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://pendientedemigracion.ucm.es/info/circulo/no56/lopez.pdf|title=Spanglish from a neurologist point of view|last=Lopez|first=Angel|date=2013|website=El Circulo|publisher=Universidad Computense de Madrid|access-date=2016-03-06}}</ref>\n\nMany Mexican-Americans (''Chicanos''), immigrants and bilinguals express themselves in various forms of Spanglish. For many, Spanglish serves as a basis for self-identity, but others believe that it should not exist.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://homes.chass.utoronto.ca/~cpercy/courses/6362Olague2.htm|title=Towards New Dialects: Spanglish in the United States|website=homes.chass.utoronto.ca|access-date=2016-03-06}}</ref>\nSpanglish is difficult, because if the speaker learned the two languages in separate contexts, they use the ''conditioned system'', in which the referential meanings in the two languages differ considerably. Those who were literate in their first language before learning the other, and who have support to maintain that literacy, are sometimes those least able to master their second language. Spanglish is part of ''receptive bilingualism.'' Receptive bilinguals are those who understand a second language but don't speak it. That is when they use Spanglish. Receptive bilinguals are also known as ''productively bilingual'', since, to give an answer, the speaker exerts much more mental effort to answer in English, Spanish, or Spanglish.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://fusion.net/story/269512/bilingual-makes-brain-stronger/|title=Does Speaking English And Spanish Make You Worse At Both Languages?|website=Fusion|access-date=2016-03-06}}</ref> Without first understanding the culture and history of the region where Spanglish evolved as a practical matter an in depth familiarizing with multiple cultures.

From a linguistic point of view, Spanglish often is mistakenly labeled many things. Spanglish is not a [[Creole language|creole]] or [[dialect]] of Spanish because, though people claim they are native Spanglish speakers, Spanglish itself is not a language on its own, but speakers speak English or Spanish with a heavy influence from the other language. The definition of Spanglish has been unclearly explained by scholars and linguists despite being noted so often. Spanglish is the fluid exchange of language between English and Spanish, present in the heavy influence in the words and phrases used by the speaker.<ref>Montes-Alcala, Cecilia, pg. 98.</ref> Spanglish is currently considered a hybrid language by linguists<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-xpm-2003-03-03-0303030101-story.html|title=Que pasa?

They represent the simplest forms of Spanglish, as they undergo no lexical or grammatical structural change.<ref name=\"Stavans 2000\">{{cite journal|last=Stavans|first=Ilan | authorlink = Ilan Stavans|title=The gravitas of Spanglish|journal=[[The Chronicle of Higher Education]]|year=2000|volume=47|issue=7}}</ref> The use of calques is common throughout most languages, evident in the calques of Arabic exclamations used in Spanish.<ref name=\"Montes-Alcala, pg. 107\">Montes-Alcala, pg. 107</ref>\n\nExamples:\n* \"to call back\"  \u2192 ''llamar p'atr\u00e1s'' (volver a llamar)\n* \"It's up to you.\" \u2192 ''Est\u00e1 p'arriba de ti.'' (Depende de ti.)\n* \"to run for governor\" \u2192 ''correr para gobernador'' (presentarse para gobernador)<ref name=\"Montes-Alcala, pg. 107\"/>\n\n===Semantic extensions===\nSemantic extension or reassignment refers to a phenomenon where speakers use a word of language A (typically Spanish in this case) with the meaning of its cognate in language B (typically English), rather than its standard meaning in language A. In Spanglish this usually occurs in the case of \"[[false friends]]\" (similar to, but technically not the same as [[false cognates]]), where words of similar form in Spanish and English are thought to have like meanings based on their cognate relationship.<ref name=\"Montes-Alcala, pg. 105\">Montes-Alcala, pg. 105</ref>\n\nExamples:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Spanglish\n! English basis and meaning\n! Standard Spanish\n! Meaning of Spanglish word in standard Spanish\n|-\n| ''actualmente''\n| actually\n| ''en realidad, realmente''\n| currently\n|-\n| ''aplicaci\u00f3n''\n| application (written request)\n| ''solicitud''\n| application (of paint, etc.)\n|-\n| ''bizarro''\n| bizarre\n| ''estramb\u00f3tico''\n| valiant, dashing\n|-\n| ''carpeta''\n| carpet\n| ''alfombra'', ''moqueta''\n| folder\n|-\n| ''chequear/checar''\n| to check (verify)\n| ''comprobar'', ''verificar''\n| \u2014\n|-\n| ''librer\u00eda''\n| library\n| ''biblioteca''\n| bookstore\n|-\n| ''mapear''\n| to mop\n| ''trapear''\n| to map (rare)\n|-\n| ''parquear''\n| to park\n| ''estacionar'', ''aparcar''\n| \u2014\n|-\n| ''rentar''\n| to rent\n| ''alquilar, arrendar''\n| to yield, to produce a profit\n|-\n| ''wacha''\n| to watch out\n| ''cuidado''\n| \u2014\n|-\n| ''recordar''\n| to record\n| ''grabar''\n| to remember\n|-\n|''realizar''\n|realize\n|''darse cuenta''\n|carry out, perform, fulfill\n|}\n\nAn example of this lexical phenomenon in Spanglish is the emergence of new verbs when the [[Productivity (linguistics)|productive]] Spanish verb-making suffix ''-ear'' is attached to an English verb. For example, the Spanish verb for \"to eat lunch\" (''almorzar'' in standard Spanish) becomes ''lonchear'' (occasionally ''lunchear''). The same process produces ''watchear'', <!--- Include ''puchar'' here IF its meaning and English basis can be given. --> ''parquear'', ''emailear'', ''twittear'', etc.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Rothman|first=Jason|author2=Amy Beth Rell |title=A linguistic analysis of Spanglish: relating language to identity|journal=Linguistics and the Human Sciences|year=2005|volume=1|issue=3|pages=515\u2013536|doi=10.1558/lhs.2005.1.3.515}}</ref>\n\n===Loan words===\n[[loanword|Loan words]] occur in any language due to the presence of items or ideas not present in the culture before, such as modern technology. The increasing rate of technological growth requires the use of loan words from the donor language due to the lack of its definition in the lexicon of the main language. This partially deals with the \"prestige\" of the donor language, which either forms a dissimilar or more similar word from the loan word. The growth of modern technology can be seen in the expressions: \"hacer click\" (to click), \"mandar un e-mail\" (to send an e-mail), \"faxear\" (to fax), \"textear\" (to text message), or \"hackear \" (to hack).  Some words borrowed from the donor languages are adapted to the language, while others remain unassimilated (e. g. \"sandwich\", \u201cjeans\u201d or \u201claptop\u201d).

The adoption of English words is very common in Spain.]]\nFromlostiano is a type of artificial and humorous [[wordplay]] that translates Spanish [[idiom]]s word-for-word into English. The name ''fromlostiano'' comes from the expression ''From Lost to the River'', which is a word-for-word translation of ''de perdidos al r\u00edo''; an idiom that means that one is prone to choose a particularly risky action in a desperate situation (this is somewhat comparable to the English idiom ''in for a penny, in for a pound''). \nThe humor comes from the fact that while the expression is completely grammatical in English, it makes no sense to a native English speaker. Hence it is necessary to understand both languages to appreciate the humor.\n\nThis phenomenon was first noted in the book ''From Lost to the River'' in 1995.<ref>{{cite book|last=Ochoa|first=Ignacio|title=From Lost to the River|date=1995|publisher=Publicaciones Formativas, S.A.|location=Madrid|isbn=978-84-920231-1-0|author2=Frederico L\u00f3pez Socasau |language=Spanish}}</ref> The book describes six types of ''fromlostiano'':\n# Translations of Spanish idioms into English: ''With you bread and onion'' (''Contigo pan y cebolla''), ''Nobody gave you a candle in this burial'' (''Nadie te ha dado vela en este entierro''), ''To good hours, green sleeves'' (''A buenas horas mangas verdes'').\n# Translations of American and British celebrities' names into Spanish: ''Vanesa Tumbarroja'' (''Vanessa Redgrave'').\n# Translations of American and British street names into Spanish: ''Calle del Panadero'' (''Baker Street'').\n# Translations of Spanish street names into English: ''Shell Thorn Street'' (''Calle de Concha Espina'').\n# Translations of multinational corporations' names into Spanish: ''Ordenadores Manzana'' (''Apple Computers'').\n# Translations of Spanish [[minced oath]]s into English: ''Tu-tut that I saw you'' (''Tarar\u00ed que te vi'').\nThe use of Spanglish has evolved over time. It has emerged as a way of conceptualizing one's thoughts whether it be in speech or on paper.\n\n==Identity==\nThe use of Spanglish is often associated with an individual's association with identity (in terms of language learning) and reflects how many minority-American cultures feel toward their heritage. Commonly in ethnic communities within the United States, the knowledge of one's [[heritage language]] tends to assumably signify if one is truly of a member of their culture. Just as Spanish helps individuals identify with their Spanish identity, Spanglish is slowly becoming the poignant realization of the Hispanic-American, especially Mexican-American, identity within the United States. Individuals of Hispanic descent living in America face living in two very different worlds and need a new sense of bi-cultural and bilingual identity of their own experience. \"This synergy of cultures and struggle with identity is reflected in language use and results in the mixing of Spanish and English.\" Spanglish is used to facilitate communication with others in both worlds; \"...code-switching is not merely a random phenomena but rather a complex system composed of a variety\". While some individuals believe that Spanglish should not be considered a language, it is a language that has evolved and is continuing to grow and affect the way new generations are educated, culture change, and the production of media.<ref>Rojas, Viviana, and Juan Pi\u00f1\u00f3n. \"Spanish, English or Spanglish?

Between 1902 and 1948, the main language of instruction in public schools (used for all subjects except foreign language courses) was English. Currently Puerto Rico is nearly unique in having both English and Spanish as its official languages<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Nash|first1=Rose|title=Spanglish: Language Contact in Puerto Rico|journal=American Speech|volume=45|issue=3/4|pages=223\u2013233|doi=10.2307/454837|jstor=454837|year=1970}}</ref> (but see also [[New Mexico#Official language|New Mexico]]). Consequently, many American English words are now found in the vocabulary of Puerto Rican Spanish. ''Spanglish'' may also be known by different regional names.\n\nSpanglish does not have one unified dialect\u2014specifically, the varieties of Spanglish spoken in New York, Florida, Texas, and California differ. Monolingual speakers of standard Spanish may have difficulty in understanding it.<ref>Ardila 2005, pg. 61.</ref>\nIt is common in Panama, where the 96-year (1903\u20131999) U.S. control of the [[Panama Canal]] influenced much of local society, especially among the former residents of the [[Panama Canal Zone]], the [[Zonian]]s.\n\nMany Puerto Ricans living on the island of [[St. Croix]] speak in informal situations a unique Spanglish-like combination of [[Puerto Rican Spanish]] and the local [[Virgin Islands Creole|Crucian dialect of Virgin Islands Creole English]], which is very different from the Spanglish spoken elsewhere. A similar situation exists in the large Puerto Rican-descended populations of New York City and Boston.\n\nSpanglish is spoken commonly in the modern United States, reflecting the growth of the Hispanic-American population due to immigration. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the population of Hispanics grew from 35.3 million to 53 million between 2000 and 2012.<ref name=\"Guzman, B. 2000 & US Census 2012\">Guzman, B. 2000 & US Census 2012</ref> Hispanics have become the largest minority ethnic group in the US.  More than 60% are of Mexican descent. Mexican Americans form one of the fastest-growing groups, increasing from 20.6 million to 34.5 million between 2000 and 2012.<ref name=\"Guzman, B. 2000 & US Census 2012\"/> Around 58% of this community chose California, especially Southern California, as their new home. Spanglish is widely used throughout the heavily Mexican-American and other Hispanic communities of Southern California.<ref name=\"Rothman, Jason pg. 1\">Rothman, Jason & Rell, Amy Beth, pg. 1</ref>\nThe use of Spanglish has become important to Hispanic communities throughout the United States in areas such as Miami, New York City, Texas, and California. In Miami, the [[Afro-Cuban]] community makes use of a Spanglish familiarly known as \"[[Cubonics]],\" a portmanteau of the words ''Cuban'' and ''Ebonics'', a slang term for [[African American Vernacular English]] that is itself a portmanteau of ''Ebony'' and ''phonics''.\"<ref name=\"Rothman, Jason pg. 1\"/>\n\nSpanglish is known as bilingualism/''semi-lingualism.'' The acquisition of the first language is interrupted or unstructured language input follows from the second language. This can also happen in reverse.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://pendientedemigracion.ucm.es/info/circulo/no56/lopez.pdf|title=Spanglish from a neurologist point of view|last=Lopez|first=Angel|date=2013|website=El Circulo|publisher=Universidad Computense de Madrid|access-date=2016-03-06}}</ref>\n\nMany Mexican-Americans (''Chicanos''), immigrants and bilinguals express themselves in various forms of Spanglish. For many, Spanglish serves as a basis for self-identity, but others believe that it should not exist.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://homes.chass.utoronto.ca/~cpercy/courses/6362Olague2.htm|title=Towards New Dialects: Spanglish in the United States|website=homes.chass.utoronto.ca|access-date=2016-03-06}}</ref>\nSpanglish is difficult, because if the speaker learned the two languages in separate contexts, they use the ''conditioned system'', in which the referential meanings in the two languages differ considerably. Those who were literate in their first language before learning the other, and who have support to maintain that literacy, are sometimes those least able to master their second language. Spanglish is part of ''receptive bilingualism.'' Receptive bilinguals are those who understand a second language but don't speak it. That is when they use Spanglish. Receptive bilinguals are also known as ''productively bilingual'', since, to give an answer, the speaker exerts much more mental effort to answer in English, Spanish, or Spanglish.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://fusion.net/story/269512/bilingual-makes-brain-stronger/|title=Does Speaking English And Spanish Make You Worse At Both Languages?|website=Fusion|access-date=2016-03-06}}</ref> Without first understanding the culture and history of the region where Spanglish evolved as a practical matter an in depth familiarizing with multiple cultures.

From a linguistic point of view, Spanglish often is mistakenly labeled many things. Spanglish is not a [[Creole language|creole]] or [[dialect]] of Spanish because, though people claim they are native Spanglish speakers, Spanglish itself is not a language on its own, but speakers speak English or Spanish with a heavy influence from the other language. The definition of Spanglish has been unclearly explained by scholars and linguists despite being noted so often. Spanglish is the fluid exchange of language between English and Spanish, present in the heavy influence in the words and phrases used by the speaker.<ref>Montes-Alcala, Cecilia, pg. 98.</ref> Spanglish is currently considered a hybrid language by linguists<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-xpm-2003-03-03-0303030101-story.html|title=Que pasa?

They represent the simplest forms of Spanglish, as they undergo no lexical or grammatical structural change.<ref name=\"Stavans 2000\">{{cite journal|last=Stavans|first=Ilan | authorlink = Ilan Stavans|title=The gravitas of Spanglish|journal=[[The Chronicle of Higher Education]]|year=2000|volume=47|issue=7}}</ref> The use of calques is common throughout most languages, evident in the calques of Arabic exclamations used in Spanish.<ref name=\"Montes-Alcala, pg. 107\">Montes-Alcala, pg. 107</ref>\n\nExamples:\n* \"to call back\"  \u2192 ''llamar p'atr\u00e1s'' (volver a llamar)\n* \"It's up to you.\" \u2192 ''Est\u00e1 p'arriba de ti.'' (Depende de ti.)\n* \"to run for governor\" \u2192 ''correr para gobernador'' (presentarse para gobernador)<ref name=\"Montes-Alcala, pg. 107\"/>\n\n===Semantic extensions===\nSemantic extension or reassignment refers to a phenomenon where speakers use a word of language A (typically Spanish in this case) with the meaning of its cognate in language B (typically English), rather than its standard meaning in language A. In Spanglish this usually occurs in the case of \"[[false friends]]\" (similar to, but technically not the same as [[false cognates]]), where words of similar form in Spanish and English are thought to have like meanings based on their cognate relationship.<ref name=\"Montes-Alcala, pg. 105\">Montes-Alcala, pg. 105</ref>\n\nExamples:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Spanglish\n! English basis and meaning\n! Standard Spanish\n!

For example, the Spanish verb for \"to eat lunch\" (''almorzar'' in standard Spanish) becomes ''lonchear'' (occasionally ''lunchear''). The same process produces ''watchear'', <!--- Include ''puchar'' here IF its meaning and English basis can be given. --> ''parquear'', ''emailear'', ''twittear'', etc.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Rothman|first=Jason|author2=Amy Beth Rell |title=A linguistic analysis of Spanglish: relating language to identity|journal=Linguistics and the Human Sciences|year=2005|volume=1|issue=3|pages=515\u2013536|doi=10.1558/lhs.2005.1.3.515}}</ref>\n\n===Loan words===\n[[loanword|Loan words]] occur in any language due to the presence of items or ideas not present in the culture before, such as modern technology. The increasing rate of technological growth requires the use of loan words from the donor language due to the lack of its definition in the lexicon of the main language. This partially deals with the \"prestige\" of the donor language, which either forms a dissimilar or more similar word from the loan word. The growth of modern technology can be seen in the expressions: \"hacer click\" (to click), \"mandar un e-mail\" (to send an e-mail), \"faxear\" (to fax), \"textear\" (to text message), or \"hackear \" (to hack).  Some words borrowed from the donor languages are adapted to the language, while others remain unassimilated (e. g. \"sandwich\", \u201cjeans\u201d or \u201claptop\u201d). The items most associated with Spanglish refer to words assimilated into the main morphology.<ref>Montes-Alcala, pg. 106</ref> Borrowing words from English and \"Spanishizing\" them has typically occurred through immigrants.<ref name=\"The New York Times\">{{cite news|last1=Alvarez|first1=Lizette|title=It's the talk of Nueva York: The hybrid called Spanglish|newspaper=The New York Times|date=1997}}</ref> This method makes new words by pronouncing an English word \"Spanish style\", thus dropping final consonants, softening others, and replacing certain consonants (i.e., M's, N's, V's) with B's.<ref name=\"The New York Times\"/>\n\nExamples: \n*\"Aseguranza\" (insurance)\n*\"Biles\" (bills)\n*\"Chorcha\" (church)\n*\"Ganga\" (gang)\n*\"L\u00edder\" (leader) \u2013 considered an established Anglicism \n*\"Lonchear/Lonchar\" (to have lunch)\n*\"Marqueta\" (market)\n*\"Taipear\" (to type)\n*\"Troca\" (truck) \u2013 Widely used in most of northern Mexico as well\n*\u201dM\u00edtin\u201d (meeting) - An outdoors gathering of people mostly for political purposes.\n*\u201dChecar\u201d (to check)\n*\u201dEscanear\u201d (to scan) - To digitalize (e.g. a document).\n*\u201dChatear\u201d (to chat) \n*\u201cDesorden\u201d (disorder) - incorrectly used as \u201cdisease\u201d.\n*\u201dCondici\u00f3n\u201d (condition) - incorrectly used as \u201csickness\u201d.\n\n=== Fromlostiano ===\n[[Image:Spanglish Madrid Baidefeis.png|thumb|Spanish street ad in [[Madrid]] humorously showing ''baidefeis'' instead of the Spanish ''gratis'' (free).<br>''Baidefeis'' derives from the English \"by the face\"; Spanish: ''por la cara'', \"free\". The adoption of English words is very common in Spain.]]\nFromlostiano is a type of artificial and humorous [[wordplay]] that translates Spanish [[idiom]]s word-for-word into English. The name ''fromlostiano'' comes from the expression ''From Lost to the River'', which is a word-for-word translation of ''de perdidos al r\u00edo''; an idiom that means that one is prone to choose a particularly risky action in a desperate situation (this is somewhat comparable to the English idiom ''in for a penny, in for a pound''). \nThe humor comes from the fact that while the expression is completely grammatical in English, it makes no sense to a native English speaker. Hence it is necessary to understand both languages to appreciate the humor.\n\nThis phenomenon was first noted in the book ''From Lost to the River'' in 1995.<ref>{{cite book|last=Ochoa|first=Ignacio|title=From Lost to the River|date=1995|publisher=Publicaciones Formativas, S.A.|location=Madrid|isbn=978-84-920231-1-0|author2=Frederico L\u00f3pez Socasau |language=Spanish}}</ref> The book describes six types of ''fromlostiano'':\n# Translations of Spanish idioms into English: ''With you bread and onion'' (''Contigo pan y cebolla''), ''Nobody gave you a candle in this burial'' (''Nadie te ha dado vela en este entierro''), ''To good hours, green sleeves'' (''A buenas horas mangas verdes'').\n# Translations of American and British celebrities' names into Spanish: ''Vanesa Tumbarroja'' (''Vanessa Redgrave'').\n# Translations of American and British street names into Spanish: ''Calle del Panadero'' (''Baker Street'').\n# Translations of Spanish street names into English: ''Shell Thorn Street'' (''Calle de Concha Espina'').\n# Translations of multinational corporations' names into Spanish: ''Ordenadores Manzana'' (''Apple Computers'').\n# Translations of Spanish [[minced oath]]s into English: ''Tu-tut that I saw you'' (''Tarar\u00ed que te vi'').\nThe use of Spanglish has evolved over time. It has emerged as a way of conceptualizing one's thoughts whether it be in speech or on paper.\n\n==Identity==\nThe use of Spanglish is often associated with an individual's association with identity (in terms of language learning) and reflects how many minority-American cultures feel toward their heritage. Commonly in ethnic communities within the United States, the knowledge of one's [[heritage language]] tends to assumably signify if one is truly of a member of their culture. Just as Spanish helps individuals identify with their Spanish identity, Spanglish is slowly becoming the poignant realization of the Hispanic-American, especially Mexican-American, identity within the United States. Individuals of Hispanic descent living in America face living in two very different worlds and need a new sense of bi-cultural and bilingual identity of their own experience. \"This synergy of cultures and struggle with identity is reflected in language use and results in the mixing of Spanish and English.\" Spanglish is used to facilitate communication with others in both worlds; \"...code-switching is not merely a random phenomena but rather a complex system composed of a variety\". While some individuals believe that Spanglish should not be considered a language, it is a language that has evolved and is continuing to grow and affect the way new generations are educated, culture change, and the production of media.<ref>Rojas, Viviana, and Juan Pi\u00f1\u00f3n. \"Spanish, English or Spanglish?

But it is her face ... that truly captivates her audience thanks to the tantalizing allure of catharsis through art. [Ziegler's] work ethic, not to mention her evident love for the art, has made her relentlessly relevant. She has something to say with her performances, whether in a music video for Sia or in a solo at nationals. Her technique is lovely, especially for a 12-year-old. She has stretched knees, pointed feet, and arms that float on clouds, her fingers perfectly placed. But still more important is her virtuosity, her connection with the public. She tells a narrative that resonates with the viewer, whether portraying a scorned lover or a werewolf. This maturity is astounding for a preteen \u2013 she just gets it. She's meant to perform, meant to communicate with people. She has defied the odds of Generation Z's competitive, egocentric mentality to make her career about the work, not the celebrity.<ref>Villarreal, Alexandra.

But it is her face ... that truly captivates her audience thanks to the tantalizing allure of catharsis through art. [Ziegler's] work ethic, not to mention her evident love for the art, has made her relentlessly relevant. She has something to say with her performances, whether in a music video for Sia or in a solo at nationals. Her technique is lovely, especially for a 12-year-old. She has stretched knees, pointed feet, and arms that float on clouds, her fingers perfectly placed. But still more important is her virtuosity, her connection with the public. She tells a narrative that resonates with the viewer, whether portraying a scorned lover or a werewolf. This maturity is astounding for a preteen \u2013 she just gets it. She's meant to perform, meant to communicate with people. She has defied the odds of Generation Z's competitive, egocentric mentality to make her career about the work, not the celebrity.<ref>Villarreal, Alexandra.
