He was Kiwi number 136 after playing two tests for New Zealand against Australia in 1919.\n\n==Early Life==\nIt is unclear where Thomas Haddon was born or raised. The first clear indication of him being in Auckland is with his debut for [[City Rovers]] in the opening game of the [[1918 Auckland Rugby League season]]. There are no records of him being born or marrying in [[New Zealand]]. At the start of 1920 he was thought to have moved to [[Australia]] to play rugby league but there are no records of him playing there after being given permission by the New Zealand Rugby League Council.\n\n==Playing career==\n===City Rovers, Auckland, and New Zealand===\nTom Haddon first appeared for [[City Rovers]] in 1918 in the [[Auckland Rugby League]] competition, playing for them against [[Grafton Athletic]] in a preliminary round to open the season <ref>{{cite news\n| title = Northern Union/Teams for Saturday/North Shore\n| page = 2\n| publisher = Auckland Star, Volume XLIX, Issue 99\n| date = 1918-04-26\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/AS19180426.2.15\n| accessdate = 2020-04-15}}</ref>. He scored a try in a Round 3 match against Grafton Athletic at [[Victoria Park, Auckland|Victoria Park]] where he \u201creceived a cross-kick and scored underneath the posts\u201d with City going on to win 11-10 <ref>{{cite news\n| title =Championship Matches/Newton V Ponsonby/Grafton V City\n| page =7\n| work=[[The New Zealand Herald]]| volume=LV| issue=16860\n| date = 1918-05-27\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19180527.2.62.1\n| accessdate = 2019-08-18}}</ref>.

During the war the [[Auckland Rugby League]] had decided to largely cease its representative program. Haddon\u2019s debut was against [[Canterbury rugby league team]] and it resulted in a comfortable 45-9 victory to Auckland with Haddon scoring twice. The match was played in front of 10,000 spectators at the [[Auckland Domain]] <ref>{{cite news\n| title =Auckland Defeats Canterbury/Forty-Five Points to Nine\n| page =3\n| work=[[The New Zealand Herald]]| volume=LV| issue=16956\n| date = 1918-09-16\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19180916.2.15.1\n| accessdate = 2019-08-10}}</ref>.\n\nIn [[1919 Auckland Rugby League season|1919]] Haddon was again playing for City and in a round two match against [[North Shore Albions]] on the Devonport Domain in front of 500 spectators <ref>{{cite news\n| title =Championships Continue/City V North Shore\n| page =5\n| work=[[The New Zealand Herald]]| volume=LVI| issue=17158\n| date = 1919-05-12\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19190512.2.21.2\n| accessdate = 2019-08-19}}</ref>.

It is however unclear as to where he went and if he played rugby league over the following years.\n\n===North Shore Albions===\nIn 1925 Haddon resumed playing rugby league in Auckland, this time however he was to represent the [[North Shore Albions]] who at this time were in fact named [[North Shore Albions|Devonport United]] after amalgamating with the Sunnyside League Football Club at the start of the 1920 season <ref>{{cite news \n| title =Two Clubs Amalgamate\n| page =6\n| work=[[The New Zealand Herald]]| volume=LVII| issue=17436\n| date = 1920-03-05\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19200405.2.100\n| accessdate = 2019-08-10}}</ref>.

The day was significant for other reasons as the teams stood in silence before the kick off out of respect for [[Bill Stormont]] (Kiwi #140) who had died two days earlier. In a July match Haddon scored a try in front of 9,000 spectators at Carlaw Park against [[Marist Saints|Marist Old Boys]]. Devonport won but not before Haddon was sent off along with Marist\u2019s New Zealand international [[Andrew O'Brien (rugby league)|Jim O'Brien]] after a \u201crough-up\u201d between the two. Devonport won the match 19-11 <ref>{{cite news\n| title = The League Code/Devonport\u2019s Day Out/Marists v Devonport\n| page = 9\n| publisher = Auckland Star, Volume LVI, Issue 145\n| date = 1925-06-22\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/AS19250622.2.108\n| accessdate = 2020-04-14}}</ref>.\n\nAfter a July match between Ponsonby and Devonport it was said of Haddon \u201cit is surprising how youth sticks to some footballers. On Saturday the veteran \u2026 was easily Devonport\u2019s best forward. He showed a lot of pace and some of the form displayed several years ago when playing for [[City Rovers|City]]\u201d <ref>{{cite news\n| title = League Football Notes and Comments/The North Shore Players\n| page =6 \n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LXII, Issue 19069\n| date = 1925-07-14\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19250714.2.9.2\n| accessdate = 2020-04-14}}</ref>.

He scored a second try later in the match after a \u201cpassing rush\u201d in which all the Devonport players took part. Haddon\u2019s final ever senior league match was in a Roope Rooster semi final loss to his old City Rovers team <ref>{{cite news\n| title = League Football/City Defeat Devonport\n| page = 14\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LXII\n| date = 1925-08-17\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19250817.2.136\n| accessdate = 2020-04-14}}</ref>.\n\nIn 1926, 27, 28, and again in 1934 Haddon played in several veteran player exhibition matches. On October 30, 1926 Haddon made an appearance in an end of season game played between well known league veterans at Carlaw Park. Haddon was representing early New Zealand rugby league legends [[Albert Asher]]\u2019s team against [[William Wynyard (rugby league)|William Wynyard]]\u2019s team <ref>{{cite news\n| title = End of Season Games/Veteran Players in Action\n| page = 15\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LXIII, Issue 19473\n| date = 1926-11-01\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19261101.2.138\n| accessdate = 2020-04-14}}</ref>. The match finished 10-10 and featured the likes of [[Eric Bennett (New Zealand)|Eric Bennett]], [[Bill Davidson (rugby league)|Bill Davidson]], and [[Thomas McClymont]]. In September, 1927 he was chosen in a Devonport United veteran team <ref>{{cite news\n| title = Rugby League/Devonport United\n| page = 11\n| publisher = Auckland Star, Volume LVIII, Issue 207\n| date = 1927-09-02\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/AS19270902.2.138.21\n| accessdate = 2020-04-15}}</ref>. Then again in October he played for [[Albert Asher]]\u2019s team against \u201cShaver\u201d Hargreaves team.

It is however unclear as to where he went and if he played rugby league over the following years.\n\n===North Shore Albions===\nIn 1925 Haddon resumed playing rugby league in Auckland, this time however he was to represent the [[North Shore Albions]] who at this time were in fact named [[North Shore Albions|Devonport United]] after amalgamating with the Sunnyside League Football Club at the start of the 1920 season <ref>{{cite news \n| title =Two Clubs Amalgamate\n| page =6\n| work=[[The New Zealand Herald]]| volume=LVII| issue=17436\n| date = 1920-03-05\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19200405.2.100\n| accessdate = 2019-08-10}}</ref>.

The day was significant for other reasons as the teams stood in silence before the kick off out of respect for [[Bill Stormont]] (Kiwi #140) who had died two days earlier. In a July match Haddon scored a try in front of 9,000 spectators at Carlaw Park against [[Marist Saints|Marist Old Boys]]. Devonport won but not before Haddon was sent off along with Marist\u2019s New Zealand international [[Andrew O'Brien (rugby league)|Jim O'Brien]] after a \u201crough-up\u201d between the two.

On Saturday the veteran \u2026 was easily Devonport\u2019s best forward. He showed a lot of pace and some of the form displayed several years ago when playing for [[City Rovers|City]]\u201d <ref>{{cite news\n| title = League Football Notes and Comments/The North Shore Players\n| page =6 \n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LXII, Issue 19069\n| date = 1925-07-14\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19250714.2.9.2\n| accessdate = 2020-04-14}}</ref>.

He scored a second try later in the match after a \u201cpassing rush\u201d in which all the Devonport players took part. Haddon\u2019s final ever senior league match was in a Roope Rooster semi final loss to his old City Rovers team <ref>{{cite news\n| title = League Football/City Defeat Devonport\n| page = 14\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LXII\n| date = 1925-08-17\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19250817.2.136\n| accessdate = 2020-04-14}}</ref>.\n\nIn 1926, 27, 28, and again in 1934 Haddon played in several veteran player exhibition matches. On October 30, 1926 Haddon made an appearance in an end of season game played between well known league veterans at Carlaw Park. Haddon was representing early New Zealand rugby league legends [[Albert Asher]]\u2019s team against [[William Wynyard (rugby league)|William Wynyard]]\u2019s team <ref>{{cite news\n| title = End of Season Games/Veteran Players in Action\n| page = 15\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LXIII, Issue 19473\n| date = 1926-11-01\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19261101.2.138\n| accessdate = 2020-04-14}}</ref>. The match finished 10-10 and featured the likes of [[Eric Bennett (New Zealand)|Eric Bennett]], [[Bill Davidson (rugby league)|Bill Davidson]], and [[Thomas McClymont]].

It is the earliest of the 18 zones of the [[Indian Railways]] created in independent India. It was created on 14 April 1951 by merging three state railways, namely, the [[Madras and Southern Mahratta Railway]], the [[South Indian Railway Company]], and the [[Mysore State Railway]]. The South Indian Railway was originally created in the British colonial times as Great Southern India Railway Co founded in [[United Kingdom|Britain]] in 1853 and registered in 1859. Its original headquarters was in [[Tiruchirappalli]] (Trichy) and was registered as a company in [[London]] only in 1890. At present, after re-organization of existing railway zones and creation of new zones undertaken by the Indian Railways between 2002\u201303, Southern Railway has emerged as the 4th largest zone after undertaking some gauge conversion projects and creation of new lines.<ref name=\"srmain\">{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090110031635/http://www.hinduonnet.com/thehindu/thscrip/print.pl?file=2006070300250500.htm&date=2006/07/03/&prd=mp&|title=Origins of Southern Railway|publisher=www.hinduonnet.com|accessdate=17 Jul 2008}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n{{see also|Timeline of Southern Railway zone}}\nIn 1944, all Railway companies were taken over by the Government. And three years later, when India woke up to independence in 1947, the stage was set for the integration of different Railways into smaller zones. In 1948, immediately after independence, there were as many as 42 different railway systems - a multiplicity of railway administrations, varying in size and standards.\n\nThe regrouping proposals put forward by the various committees were studied in great detail to ensure that a unification could be achieved with the least disturbance and dislocation. Important associations of railway-users, Chambers of Commerce and Industry, the State Governments and acknowledged experts both in India and abroad were fully consulted.\n\nShri [[N. Gopalaswami Ayyangar]] - the then Minister for Railways, was the principal architect of the regrouping of Indian Railways. In December 1950, the Central Advisory Committee for Railways approved the plan for Indian Railways into six Zonal systems, namely, the Northern, the North-Eastern, the Southern, the Central, the Eastern and the Western.\n\nThe Southern Railway zone {{convert|9654|km}} was the first zone to be formed.<ref>{{cite web|title=Origins and history of Southern Railway|url=http://shodhganga.inflibnet.ac.in/bitstream/10603/12705/10/10_chapter%202.pdf|accessdate=14 February 2015}}</ref> Created on 14 April 1951 by the merger of the Madras and Southern Mahratta Railway, the South Indian Railway and the Mysore State Railway, the economic and geographical factors of this zone facilitated an early integrated network. This amalgamation was a major step towards streamlining and organizing the working pattern of the Railway system.\n\nShri K R Ramanujam was appointed the first General Manager of the newly formed Southern Railways.\n\n==Organisation==\nThe Southern Railway is headed by the General Manager (HAG+) Officer, assisted by an Additional General Manager (HAG). Each department is headed by a PHOD\\CHOD of the rank of HAG\\SAG.\n\n==Jurisdiction==\nSouthern Railway has its headquarters in Chennai and has the following six divisions: \n#{{rwd|Chennai}}\n#{{rwd|Madurai}}\n#{{rwd|Palakkad}}\n#{{rwd|Salem}}\n#{{rwd|Thiruvananthapuram}}\n#{{rwd|Tiruchirappalli}}\n\nIt covers the states of [[Tamil Nadu]], [[Kerala]], [[Puducherry]] and small portions of [[Andhra Pradesh]] and [[Karnataka]]. More than 50 [[crore]] passengers travel on the network every year.\n\n== Operations ==\nThe zone operates both passenger and freight trains. The biggest station of the Zone is [[Puratchi Thalaivar Dr. M.G. Ramachandran Central Railway Station]]. Other major stations of the Zone includes [[Chennai Egmore railway station|Chennai Egmore]], Arakkonam Junction, Vellore Katpadi Junction, [[Mangalore Central railway station|Mangalore Central]], [[Mangalore Junction railway station|Mangalore Jn.]], [[Coimbatore Junction railway station|Coimbatore]], [[Salem Junction|Salem]], [[Palakkad Junction railway station|Palakkad]], [[Kozhikode railway station|Kozhikode]], [[Viluppuram Junction|Viluppuram]], [[Ernakulam Junction railway station|Ernakulam]] Junction, [[Kottayam Railway Station]],  [[Madurai Junction railway station|Madurai]], [[Tirunelveli Junction railway station|Tirunelveli]], [[Tiruchirappalli Junction railway station|Trichy]], [[Thiruvananthapuram Central railway station|Thiruvananthapuram Central]], [[Kochuveli railway station|Trivandrum Kochuveli]], [[Nagercoil Junction railway station|Nagercoil Junction]], Jolarpettai Junction , [[Erode Junction|Erode]], [[Kollam Junction Railway Station|Kollam]], [[Thrissur Railway Station|Thrissur]], [[Kannur Railway Station|Kannur]], [[Shoranur Junction railway station|Shoranur]], and [[Puducherry railway station|Puducherry]]. Passenger trains range from day intercity trains to overnight trains, long-distance trains to other zones, [[Shatabdi Express|Shatabdi]] and passenger trains stopping at many stations. The zone owns a large number of coaches.  These are maintained at coach care centres. Basin Bridge coach care centre serving Chennai central is one of the biggest in the country. Most major stations have a coach care Centre. The stations which don't have such facilities are served by trains through sometimes complex rake-sharing arrangements which also increases the utilization of the coaches. Apart from these Centres, the zone has MEMU and DEMU car sheds. These are available in Avadi, Trichy, Erode, Palakkad and Kollam. The zone also operates [[Chennai Suburban Railway|suburban system in Chennai]].\n\nFreight operations mainly include container traffic from all the ports falling under its jurisdiction ( [[Chennai Port|Chennai]], [[New Mangalore Port|Mangalore]], [[Ennore Port|Ennore]], [[Cochin Port|Cochin]] and [[Tuticorin Port Trust|Tuticorin]] are some of the major ports) and coal-traffic bound to the thermal power stations in Tamil  Nadu state from the ports. Public sector oil companies also transport petroleum products from refineries to storage terminals using the zone. Cement plants also use the railway system extensively. Food grains are also transported through freight trains. Most of the lines inside ports, thermal stations, manufacturing industries and owned by the respective companies and the zone provides a link connecting its network and the wagons and locomotives. There is a wagon care centre in Tondiarpet, Chennai.\n\nThe zone has electric loco sheds at Royapuram, Erode and Arakkonam. Diesel loco sheds are present at Tondiarpet, Golden Rock, Ernakulam and Erode.  Most of the important routes are electrified and only low traffic lines are unelectrified. However, it is common to see diesel locos in electrified lines due to various operational constraints. It is also common to see other zones' locomotives operating inside the zone and vice versa.\n\nSince the zone has little freight traffic compared to other zones and huge passenger traffic (which are run at low fares across the country), the zones' finances are often in a bad shape.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/southern-railway-punctuality-and-fiscal-performance-hit/articleshow/62666618.cms|title=Southern Railway punctuality and fiscal performance hit - Times of India|work=The Times of India|access-date=2018-02-24}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/southern-railways-financial-and-operational-performance-dips/articleshow/60077695.cms|title=Southern Railway\u2019s financial and operational performance dips - Times of India|work=The Times of India|access-date=2018-02-24}}</ref>\n\n==Infrastructure==\n=== Assets ===\n\nSouthern Railway has many factories & sheds:\n* '''Mechanical Workshops'''\n** Carriage, Wagon and Loco Works, Perambur, Chennai\n** [[Golden Rock Railway Workshop|Central Workshop, Ponmalai, Tiruchirapalli]]\n** Engineering Work Shop, Arakkonam\n* '''Signal & Telecommunication Workshop'''\n** Southern Railway Signal & Telecom Workshop, Podanur, Coimbatore\n* '''Sheds'''\n** Locomotive Sheds\n*** Diesel\n**** [[Diesel Loco Shed, Golden Rock]], [[Tiruchirapalli]]\n**** Diesel Loco Shed, [[Tondiarpet]], [[Chennai]]\n**** [[Diesel Loco Shed, Erode]]\n**** [[Diesel Loco Shed, Ernakulam]]\n*** Electrical\n**** Electrical Loco Shed, [[Arakkonam]]\n**** Electrical Loco Shed, [[Erode]]\n**** Electrical Loco Shed, [[Royapuram]], Chennai\n*** Steam Loco Shed\n**** Coonoor, [[The Nilgiris District|The Nilgiris]]\n** [[MEMU]] Car Shed\n*** [[Kollam MEMU Shed|MEMU Car Shed]], [[Kollam]]\n*** [[MEMU]] Car Shed, [[Palakkad]]\n** EMU Car Shed\n*** EMU Car Shed, Avadi \n*** EMU Car Shed, Tambaram\n*** EMU Car Shed,Velachery\n** '''BG Coaching Maintenance Depots'''\n*** [[Basin Bridge]], [[Chennai]]\n*** [[Egmore]], [[Chennai]]\n*** [[Madurai]]\n*** [[Salem, Tamil Nadu|Salem]]\n*** [[Erode]]\n*** [[Coimbatore]]\n*** [[Mettupalayam, Coimbatore|Mettupalayam]]\n*** [[Shoranur]]\n*** [[Mangalore]] central\n*** [[Thiruvananthapuram]]\n*** [[Ernakulam]]\n*** [[Kollam]]\n*** [[Tirunelveli]]\n*** [[Nagercoil]]\n*** [[Rameswaram]]\n*** [[Thoothukudi]]\n*** [[Tiruchirapalli]]\n*** [[Viluppuram]]\n*** [[Tambaram]]\n** '''Wagon Maintenance Depots'''\n*** Tondiarpet, Chennai\n*** Egmore, Chennai\n*** Madurai\n*** Jolarpettai\n*** Kochi Harbour\n*** [[Arakkonam]]\n*** Royapuram, Chennai\n*** Pattibiram Military Siding\n*** Erode\n*** [[Mangalore]] junction\n*** Ernakulam\n*** Milavittan\n*** Irumpanam\n*** Tiruchirapalli\n*** Viluppuram\n*** Uthagamandalam\n* '''Printing Presses'''\n** General Printing Press, Royapuram, Chennai\n** Ticket Printing Factory, Thiruvananthapuram,\n** Ticket Printing Factory, Tiruchirappalli\n\n=== Rail transport ===\n==== Surveys ====\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!!

It is the earliest of the 18 zones of the [[Indian Railways]] created in independent India. It was created on 14 April 1951 by merging three state railways, namely, the [[Madras and Southern Mahratta Railway]], the [[South Indian Railway Company]], and the [[Mysore State Railway]]. The South Indian Railway was originally created in the British colonial times as Great Southern India Railway Co founded in [[United Kingdom|Britain]] in 1853 and registered in 1859. Its original headquarters was in [[Tiruchirappalli]] (Trichy) and was registered as a company in [[London]] only in 1890. At present, after re-organization of existing railway zones and creation of new zones undertaken by the Indian Railways between 2002\u201303, Southern Railway has emerged as the 2nd largest zone after undertaking some gauge conversion projects and creation of new lines.<ref name=\"srmain\">{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090110031635/http://www.hinduonnet.com/thehindu/thscrip/print.pl?file=2006070300250500.htm&date=2006/07/03/&prd=mp&|title=Origins of Southern Railway|publisher=www.hinduonnet.com|accessdate=17 Jul 2008}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n{{see also|Timeline of Southern Railway zone}}\nIn 1944, all Railway companies were taken over by the Government. And three years later, when India woke up to independence in 1947, the stage was set for the integration of different Railways into smaller zones. In 1948, immediately after independence, there were as many as 42 different railway systems - a multiplicity of railway administrations, varying in size and standards.\n\nThe regrouping proposals put forward by the various committees were studied in great detail to ensure that a unification could be achieved with the least disturbance and dislocation. Important associations of railway-users, Chambers of Commerce and Industry, the State Governments and acknowledged experts both in India and abroad were fully consulted.\n\nShri [[N. Gopalaswami Ayyangar]] - the then Minister for Railways, was the principal architect of the regrouping of Indian Railways. In December 1950, the Central Advisory Committee for Railways approved the plan for Indian Railways into six Zonal systems, namely, the Northern, the North-Eastern, the Southern, the Central, the Eastern and the Western.\n\nThe Southern Railway zone {{convert|9654|km}} was the first zone to be formed.<ref>{{cite web|title=Origins and history of Southern Railway|url=http://shodhganga.inflibnet.ac.in/bitstream/10603/12705/10/10_chapter%202.pdf|accessdate=14 February 2015}}</ref> Created on 14 April 1951 by the merger of the Madras and Southern Mahratta Railway, the South Indian Railway and the Mysore State Railway, the economic and geographical factors of this zone facilitated an early integrated network. This amalgamation was a major step towards streamlining and organizing the working pattern of the Railway system.\n\nShri K R Ramanujam was appointed the first General Manager of the newly formed Southern Railways.\n\n==Organisation==\nThe Southern Railway is headed by the General Manager (HAG+) Officer, assisted by an Additional General Manager (HAG). Each department is headed by a PHOD\\CHOD of the rank of HAG\\SAG.\n\n==Jurisdiction==\nSouthern Railway has its headquarters in Chennai and has the following six divisions: \n#{{rwd|Chennai}}\n#{{rwd|Madurai}}\n#{{rwd|Palakkad}}\n#{{rwd|Salem}}\n#{{rwd|Thiruvananthapuram}}\n#{{rwd|Tiruchirappalli}}\n\nIt covers the states of [[Tamil Nadu]], [[Kerala]], [[Puducherry]] and small portions of [[Andhra Pradesh]] and [[Karnataka]]. More than 50 [[crore]] passengers travel on the network every year.\n\n== Operations ==\nThe zone operates both passenger and freight trains. The biggest station of the Zone is [[Puratchi Thalaivar Dr. M.G. Ramachandran Central Railway Station]]. Other major stations of the Zone includes [[Chennai Egmore railway station|Chennai Egmore]], Arakkonam Junction, Vellore Katpadi Junction, [[Mangalore Central railway station|Mangalore Central]], [[Mangalore Junction railway station|Mangalore Jn.]], [[Coimbatore Junction railway station|Coimbatore]], [[Salem Junction|Salem]], [[Palakkad Junction railway station|Palakkad]], [[Kozhikode railway station|Kozhikode]], [[Viluppuram Junction|Viluppuram]], [[Ernakulam Junction railway station|Ernakulam]] Junction, [[Kottayam Railway Station]],  [[Madurai Junction railway station|Madurai]], [[Tirunelveli Junction railway station|Tirunelveli]], [[Tiruchirappalli Junction railway station|Trichy]], [[Thiruvananthapuram Central railway station|Thiruvananthapuram Central]], [[Kochuveli railway station|Trivandrum Kochuveli]], [[Nagercoil Junction railway station|Nagercoil Junction]], Jolarpettai Junction , [[Erode Junction|Erode]], [[Kollam Junction Railway Station|Kollam]], [[Thrissur Railway Station|Thrissur]], [[Kannur Railway Station|Kannur]], [[Shoranur Junction railway station|Shoranur]], and [[Puducherry railway station|Puducherry]]. Passenger trains range from day intercity trains to overnight trains, long-distance trains to other zones, [[Shatabdi Express|Shatabdi]] and passenger trains stopping at many stations. The zone owns a large number of coaches.  These are maintained at coach care centres. Basin Bridge coach care centre serving Chennai central is one of the biggest in the country. Most major stations have a coach care Centre. The stations which don't have such facilities are served by trains through sometimes complex rake-sharing arrangements which also increases the utilization of the coaches. Apart from these Centres, the zone has MEMU and DEMU car sheds. These are available in Avadi, Trichy, Erode, Palakkad and Kollam. The zone also operates [[Chennai Suburban Railway|suburban system in Chennai]].\n\nFreight operations mainly include container traffic from all the ports falling under its jurisdiction ( [[Chennai Port|Chennai]], [[New Mangalore Port|Mangalore]], [[Ennore Port|Ennore]], [[Cochin Port|Cochin]] and [[Tuticorin Port Trust|Tuticorin]] are some of the major ports) and coal-traffic bound to the thermal power stations in Tamil  Nadu state from the ports. Public sector oil companies also transport petroleum products from refineries to storage terminals using the zone. Cement plants also use the railway system extensively. Food grains are also transported through freight trains. Most of the lines inside ports, thermal stations, manufacturing industries and owned by the respective companies and the zone provides a link connecting its network and the wagons and locomotives. There is a wagon care centre in Tondiarpet, Chennai.\n\nThe zone has electric loco sheds at Royapuram, Erode and Arakkonam. Diesel loco sheds are present at Tondiarpet, Golden Rock, Ernakulam and Erode.  Most of the important routes are electrified and only low traffic lines are unelectrified. However, it is common to see diesel locos in electrified lines due to various operational constraints. It is also common to see other zones' locomotives operating inside the zone and vice versa.\n\nSince the zone has little freight traffic compared to other zones and huge passenger traffic (which are run at low fares across the country), the zones' finances are often in a bad shape.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/southern-railway-punctuality-and-fiscal-performance-hit/articleshow/62666618.cms|title=Southern Railway punctuality and fiscal performance hit - Times of India|work=The Times of India|access-date=2018-02-24}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/southern-railways-financial-and-operational-performance-dips/articleshow/60077695.cms|title=Southern Railway\u2019s financial and operational performance dips - Times of India|work=The Times of India|access-date=2018-02-24}}</ref>\n\n==Infrastructure==\n=== Assets ===\n\nSouthern Railway has many factories & sheds:\n* '''Mechanical Workshops'''\n** Carriage, Wagon and Loco Works, Perambur, Chennai\n** [[Golden Rock Railway Workshop|Central Workshop, Ponmalai, Tiruchirapalli]]\n** Engineering Work Shop, Arakkonam\n* '''Signal & Telecommunication Workshop'''\n** Southern Railway Signal & Telecom Workshop, Podanur, Coimbatore\n* '''Sheds'''\n** Locomotive Sheds\n*** Diesel\n**** [[Diesel Loco Shed, Golden Rock]], [[Tiruchirapalli]]\n**** Diesel Loco Shed, [[Tondiarpet]], [[Chennai]]\n**** [[Diesel Loco Shed, Erode]]\n**** [[Diesel Loco Shed, Ernakulam]]\n*** Electrical\n**** Electrical Loco Shed, [[Arakkonam]]\n**** Electrical Loco Shed, [[Erode]]\n**** Electrical Loco Shed, [[Royapuram]], Chennai\n*** Steam Loco Shed\n**** Coonoor, [[The Nilgiris District|The Nilgiris]]\n** [[MEMU]] Car Shed\n*** [[Kollam MEMU Shed|MEMU Car Shed]], [[Kollam]]\n*** [[MEMU]] Car Shed, [[Palakkad]]\n** EMU Car Shed\n*** EMU Car Shed, Avadi \n*** EMU Car Shed, Tambaram\n*** EMU Car Shed,Velachery\n** '''BG Coaching Maintenance Depots'''\n*** [[Basin Bridge]], [[Chennai]]\n*** [[Egmore]], [[Chennai]]\n*** [[Madurai]]\n*** [[Salem, Tamil Nadu|Salem]]\n*** [[Erode]]\n*** [[Coimbatore]]\n*** [[Mettupalayam, Coimbatore|Mettupalayam]]\n*** [[Shoranur]]\n*** [[Mangalore]] central\n*** [[Thiruvananthapuram]]\n*** [[Ernakulam]]\n*** [[Kollam]]\n*** [[Tirunelveli]]\n*** [[Nagercoil]]\n*** [[Rameswaram]]\n*** [[Thoothukudi]]\n*** [[Tiruchirapalli]]\n*** [[Viluppuram]]\n*** [[Tambaram]]\n** '''Wagon Maintenance Depots'''\n*** Tondiarpet, Chennai\n*** Egmore, Chennai\n*** Madurai\n*** Jolarpettai\n*** Kochi Harbour\n*** [[Arakkonam]]\n*** Royapuram, Chennai\n*** Pattibiram Military Siding\n*** Erode\n*** [[Mangalore]] junction\n*** Ernakulam\n*** Milavittan\n*** Irumpanam\n*** Tiruchirapalli\n*** Viluppuram\n*** Uthagamandalam\n* '''Printing Presses'''\n** General Printing Press, Royapuram, Chennai\n** Ticket Printing Factory, Thiruvananthapuram,\n** Ticket Printing Factory, Tiruchirappalli\n\n=== Rail transport ===\n==== Surveys ====\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!!

It is the first game in the [[Worms (series)|''Worms series'']] of video games.\n\n''Worms'' is a [[turn based]] game where a player controls a team of worms against other teams of worms that are controlled by a computer or human opponent. The aim is to use various weapons to kill the worms on the other teams and have the last surviving worm(s).\n\n==Gameplay==\n[[Image:Worms scrapyardscreenshot.png|thumb|left|From the [[Amiga]] version: A [[scrapyard]] themed level, with the player using the [[blowtorch]] tool.]]\n''Worms'' is a turn based [[artillery game]], similar to other early games in the genre such as ''[[Scorched Earth (video game)|Scorched Earth]].\nEach player controls a team of several worms. During the course of the game, players take turns selecting one of their worms. They then use whatever tools and weapons are available to attack and kill the opponents' worms, thereby winning the game. Worms may move around the terrain in a variety of ways, normally by walking and jumping but also by using particular tools such as the \"Bungee\" and \"Ninja Rope\", to move to otherwise inaccessible areas. Each turn is time-limited to ensure that players do not hold up the game with excessive thinking or moving. The time limit can be modified in some of the games in the Worms series.\n\nOver fifty weapons and tools may be available each time a game is played, and differing selections of weapons and tools can be saved into a \"scheme\" for easy selection in future games. Other scheme settings allow options such as deployment of reinforcement crates, from which additional weapons can be obtained, and sudden death where the game is rushed to a conclusion after a time limit expires. Some settings provide for the inclusion of objects such as land mines and explosive barrels.\n\nWhen most weapons are used, they cause explosions that deform the terrain, creating circular cavities. If a worm is hit with a weapon, they will lose health. A worm who is out of health will die by blowing themselves up and leaving a grave marker. Worms can also die by being thrown off the side of the map or by falling into the water at the map's base.\n\n==Development==\nThe game was originally created by Andy Davidson as an entry for a [[Blitz BASIC]] programming competition run by the ''[[Amiga Format]]'' magazine, a cut-down version of the [[programming language]] having been covermounted previously. The game at this stage was called '''''Total Wormage''''' (possibly in reference to ''[[Total Carnage]]'') and it did not win the competition. Davidson sent the game to several publishers with no success. He then took the game to the [[European Computer Trade Show]], where he met with Mark Foreman \u2013 Head Games Buyer at GEM Distribution. Mark suggested to Andy that he should speak to Ocean/Team17 as they would be an ideal partner \u2013 they also had a stand at the show. Team17 made an offer on-the-spot to develop and publish the game.<ref>IGN [ Worms Blast Preview]</ref><ref>GameSpy [ Worms: Open Warfare Developer Diary]</ref>\n\nDuring the development of ''Worms 2'', Andy Davidson wrote ''Worms \u2013 The Director's Cut'', a special edition produced exclusively for the AGA chipset Amiga. Only 5000 copies were ever sold. It was also the last version released for the Commodore Amiga platform from which the game originated.\n\nThe references to the developers' home county, [[Yorkshire]], is visible, with a soundbank named \"Tykes\", which is a Yorkshire accent, and in the \"Hell\" level found in the single player mission mode, a sign with \"Welcome to [[Ossett]]! Ha! ha! ha!\" written on it.\n\nThe North American release of the [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]] version was the subject of considerable negotiation, as Sony Computer Entertainment of America had a policy against 2D games being published for the console. The [[Sega Saturn]] version of the game was a straight port of the PlayStation version.\n\nIn 1995, Team17 began development on a port of ''Worms'' to [[Nintendo]]'s [[Virtual Boy]] platform.<ref name=\"MMan\u00edav3i8\">{{cite magazine|author=|url=https://archive.org/stream/MicromaniaTerceraEpocaSpanishIssue8#page/n57/mode/1up|title=Reportaje: Extra\u00f1a mezcla... de gusanos - Worms|magazine=[[Microman\u00eda]]|volume=3|issue=8|publisher=HobbyPress|date=September 1995|page=58|lang=es}}</ref> The game was to be published by Ocean, but was canceled only weeks into development as a result of Nintendo's discontinuation of the console.<ref>[http://www.vr32.de/modules/games/?u030 VR32.de] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090322181752/http://www.vr32.de/modules/games/?u030 |date=2009-03-22 }}</ref> A [[32X]] release was also planned but never released as well.<ref name=\"MMan\u00edav3i8\"/>\n\nAn [[Atari Jaguar]] version was also developed by Team17 and published by [[Telegames]] in May 15, 1998.<ref>{{cite magazine|last=Charlton|first=Frank|url=http://www.stformat.com/stf85/pages_nx1500/stf85_010.jpg|title=STF News... - Worms wriggles in|magazine=[[ST Format]]|issue=85|publisher=[[Future plc]]|date=August 1996|page=10}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Smith|first=Jason|url=http://www.jaguarsector.com/index.php?autocom=ibwiki&cmd=article&do=print_article&id=379|title=Atari Jaguar Timeline|website=jaguarsector.com|accessdate=2018-09-13|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130629025431/http://www.jaguarsector.com/index.php?autocom=ibwiki&cmd=article&do=print_article&id=379|archivedate=29 June 2013|url-status=live}}</ref> Telegames announced the release of this version after becoming the last remaining software publisher for the Jaguar and like other games published following the system's discontinuation,<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://retrocdn.net/index.php?title=File%3AEGM_US_094.pdf&page=24|title=Tidbits...|magazine=[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]|issue=94|publisher=[[Ziff Davis]]|date=May 1997|page=24}}</ref> ''Worms'' could be purchased either through [[Direct selling|direct order]] from Telegames' US and UK websites or select retailers such as [[EB Games|Electronics Boutique]].<ref>{{cite magazine|last=|first=|url=https://retrocdn.net/index.php?title=File:GamePro_US_105.pdf&page=22|title=News Bits|magazine=[[GamePro]]|issue=105|publisher=[[International Data Group|IDG]]|date=June 1997|page=20}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://archive.org/stream/Gamefan_Vol_5_Issue_10#page/n41|title=Recent Sightings of an Endangered Species|magazine=[[GameFan]]|volume=5|issue=10|publisher=Shinno Media|date=October 1997|page=36}}</ref> It also served as the final title released for the console to be officially licensed with the Atari name, as the rights to said name and other [[intellectual property]] rights of [[Atari Corporation]] were sold to [[Hasbro Interactive]] before [[JT Storage]]'s bankruptcy in [[1999 in video gaming|1999]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.host.fptoday.com/melek/jaguar/jag-96.htm|title=Hasbro Interactive Acquires Legendary Atari Game Property Assets|website=Nine Lives|date=March 16, 1998|accessdate=2018-12-02|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051107232949/http://www.host.fptoday.com/melek/jaguar/jag-96.htm|archivedate=7 November 2005|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n===Character, level and sound design===\nThe game's graphics and sound design is primarily 'cartoon-like' (though less so than the later games in the series). Levels designs are randomly generated by the use of alpha-numeric strings as their [[Random seed|seeds]]. The object and landscape sets used to generate the field are arranged into 'themes' including forests, martian landscapes, beaches and 'hell'.\n\n==Remake==\n''Worms'' is the first in the [[Worms (series)|''Worms series'']] of games. A [[Video game remake|remake]], also called ''[[Worms (2007 video game)|Worms]]'', for the Xbox 360 was released in 2007. It has since been released to the PS3, in April 2009, and on the [[iPhone]] on July 11, 2009.\n\n==Worms Reinforcements==\n''Worms Reinforcements'' ([[1996 in video gaming|1996]]) is an expansion pack for ''Worms'', which was later amalgamated with the original game to create ''Worms and Reinforcements United'' (a.k.a. ''Worms United'' or ''Worms Utd.'') the same year. Released only for the [[personal computer|PC]], it added a single player campaign and the ability to add custom levels and soundpacks (which was already available for the [[Amiga]] version). It also included an introductory FMV.\n\n==Worms: The Director's Cut==\n''[[Worms: The Director's Cut]]'' ([[1997 in video gaming|1997]]) is a sequel to ''Worms'', available only on the Amiga. It is largely built upon the original Amiga game engine with various gameplay enhancement and additions, as well as graphical improvements and fixes.\n\n== Reception ==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"float:right; font-size:80%; text-align:center; margin:1em; margin-top:0; padding:0; background:none;\" cellpadding=\"0\"\n! colspan=10 style=\"font-size: 100%\" | Reception\n|-\n! colspan=10 | Aggregate scores\n|-\n! rowspan=2  | Aggregator\n! colspan=10 | Scores\n|-\n!

By March 1996, its sales had reached almost 250,000 copies, following its release in November 1995.<ref name=wormssales>{{cite web | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/19961018190644/http://www.nuke.com:80/cgr/news/9603/worms.htm | url=http://www.nuke.com:80/cgr/news/9603/worms.htm | title=Sales of ''Worms'' skyrockets | author=Staff | date=March 1996 | archivedate=October 18, 1996 | work=[[Computer Game Review]] | url-status=dead }}</ref> Across all its ports, the game ultimately sold above 5 million units by 2006.<ref name=\"RG23\">{{cite magazine|last=Day|first=Ashley|title=The Making of...

Reviewing the Saturn version, ''[[Sega Saturn Magazine]]'' especially praised Worms's unexpected complexity and the fun of multiplayer mode, and called it \"Quite simply the most playable game to hit the Saturn so far.\"<ref name=\"SSMukSSw\"/>\n\n''Maximum'' commented that \"Basically, ''Worms'' is ''Lemmings'', but it's without the puzzles and with weapons instead.\" While firmly stating that they found the game dull and unappealing, they acknowledged that it was clearly well-liked by gamers.<ref name=\"MaximumSSw\"/><ref name=\"MaximumSSw/>\n\nA ''[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]'' critic argued while the game resembles ''Lemmings'' on a cursory examination, in actuality it is much more similar to ''Cannon Fodder''. Praising the need for both strategy and skill, the multiplayer design, and the randomly generated landscapes, he described ''Worms'' as \"the kind of game that makes no excuses for its lack of texture-mapped polygons or its minimalist gameplay. ''Worms'' is a fun game with an infectious spirit and near endless replay value.\"<ref name=\"NGenPSw\"/><ref name=\"NGenSSw\"/>\n\nCoach Kyle of ''[[GamePro]]'' summarized that \"A humorous concept never really pays off in ''Worms''.\" He criticized that the tiny size of the characters and their weapons makes them unappealing and even hard to make out. While allowing that the use of the different weapons is interesting at first, he found the action too slow-paced and repetitive to maintain interest.<ref name=\"GProSSw\"/>\n\nThe four reviewers of ''[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]'' commented that \"Some games have great graphics and control, but ''Worms'' doesn't need either because the fun factor is a 10+. With multiplayer ability of up to four people, ''Worms'' is one of those games that is so unique, it doesn't fit into any category - except innovative and incredibly addictive.\"<ref name=\"EGMSSw\"/> They later named it one of their \"Top 5 Most Original Games of 1996\".<ref>{{cite magazine|title=Top 5 Most Original Games of 1996|magazine=[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]|issue=91|publisher=[[Ziff Davis]] |date=February 1997|page=152}}</ref>\n\n''[[GameSpot]]'' criticized the slowness of large multiplayer sessions and the imprecision of the keyboard controls, but, like ''Sega Saturn Magazine'', they lauded the combination of surface simplicity and underlying complexity, summarizing that \"Like the board game [[Othello (game)|Othello]], ''Worms'' takes only a few minutes to learn, but may take a lifetime to master.\"<ref name=\"GSpotPCw\"/>\n\nConversely, the ''[[Amiga Power]]'' review, written in the style of a magazine personality quiz, whilst praising the detail of the animation, described frustrating imbalances especially in relation to the vaunted 16-player multi-player mode and was critical of the puerility of the game's humour.<ref name=\"APA500w\"/>\n\n''Electronic Gaming Monthly'' named ''Worms'' a runner-up for Strategy Game of the Year (behind ''[[Dragon Force]]'').<ref>{{cite magazine |title=The Best of '96|magazine=[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]] |issue=92|publisher=[[Ziff Davis]]|date=March 1997|page=88}}</ref>\n\n{{clear}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n*{{official website|http://worms.team17.com/}} ''Worms'' series\n*{{MobyGames|id=/worms|name=''Worms''}}\n*[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08C-ttHHKFs Total Wormage trailer]\n\n{{Team17}}\n{{Virtual Boy}}\n{{Worms series}}\n{{Portal bar|1990s|United Kingdom|Video games}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Worms (1995 video game)}}\n[[Category:Worms games| 01]]\n[[Category:1995 video games]]\n[[Category:Ocean Software games]]\n[[Category:Video games developed in the United Kingdom]]\n[[Category:Video games with expansion packs]]\n[[Category:Games commercially released with DOSBox]]\n[[Category:Amiga games]]\n[[Category:Artillery video games]]\n[[Category:Atari Jaguar games]]\n[[Category:Cancelled Sega 32X games]]\n[[Category:Cancelled Virtual Boy games]]\n[[Category:CD32 games]]\n[[Category:DOS games]]\n[[Category:Game Boy games]]\n[[Category:PlayStation (console) games]]\n[[Category:Sega Genesis games]]\n[[Category:Sega Saturn games]]\n[[Category:Strategy video games]]\n[[Category:Super Nintendo Entertainment System games]]\n[[Category:Team17]]\n[[Category:Telegames games]]\n[[Category:Video games scored by Allister Brimble]]\n", "text_old": "{{About||the 2007 game|Worms (2007 video game)|the 1983 game|Worms?}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=April 2020}}\n{{under construction|placedby=KGRAMR|nosection=yes}}\n{{in use}}\n{{Infobox video game\n| title        = Worms\n| image        = Worms-win-cover.jpg\n| image_size   = 256px\n| caption      = \n| developer    = [[Team17]]\n| publisher    = [[Ocean Software]]\n| designer     = [[Andy Davidson (game designer)|Andy Davidson]]\n|composer      = [[Bj\u00f8rn Lynne]]\n| series       = ''[[Worms (series)|Worms]]''\n| engine       = \n| released     = '''Amiga, CD32, Game Boy & Mac'''<br />{{vgrelease|EU|1995<ref>{{MobyGames|id=/worms|name=''Worms''}}</ref><ref>[http://amr.abime.net/review_10209 Worms review from CU Amiga Magazine (Dec 1995) \u2013 Amiga Magazine Rack] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120220093731/http://amr.abime.net/review_10209 |date=2012-02-20 }}</ref>}}'''Mega Drive'''<br />{{vgrelease|EU|June 1, 1995}}'''PC (DOS)'''<br />{{Video game release|NA|October 31, 1995 (Retail)|EU|1995|NA|October 19, 2011 (Steam)}}'''PlayStation'''<br />{{Video game release|NA|1996|EU|November, 1995<ref name=\"CTW565\">{{cite magazine |title=Christmas Games Guide |magazine=Computer Trade Weekly |location=United Kingdom |date=27 November 1995 |issue=565 |page=43 }}</ref>|JP|February 28, 1997}}'''SNES'''<br />{{vgrelease|EU|September 29, 1996}}'''Saturn'''<br />{{Video game release|NA|1996|EU|1995|JP|March 14, 1997}}'''Jaguar'''<br />{{vgrelease|NA|May 15, 1998}}\n| genre        = [[Artillery game|Artillery]], [[Strategy video game|Strategy]]\n| modes        = [[Single-player]], [[multiplayer]]\n| platforms    = [[Amiga]], [[Amiga CD32]], [[Game Boy]], [[Sega Genesis]], [[Atari Jaguar]], [[Mac OS]], [[IBM PC compatible]] ([[MS-DOS]]), [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]], [[Sega Saturn]], [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System|Super NES]]\n}}\n'''''Worms''''' is a 2D [[Artillery game|artillery]] [[Strategy video game|tactical]] video game developed by [[Team17]] and released in [[1995 in video gaming|1995]]. It is the first game in the [[Worms (series)|''Worms series'']] of video games.\n\n''Worms'' is a [[turn based]] game where a player controls a team of worms against other teams of worms that are controlled by a computer or human opponent. The aim is to use various weapons to kill the worms on the other teams and have the last surviving worm(s).\n\n==Gameplay==\n[[Image:Worms scrapyardscreenshot.png|thumb|left|From the [[Amiga]] version: A [[scrapyard]] themed level, with the player using the [[blowtorch]] tool.]]\n''Worms'' is a turn based [[artillery game]], similar to other early games in the genre such as ''[[Scorched Earth (video game)|Scorched Earth]].\nEach player controls a team of several worms. During the course of the game, players take turns selecting one of their worms. They then use whatever tools and weapons are available to attack and kill the opponents' worms, thereby winning the game. Worms may move around the terrain in a variety of ways, normally by walking and jumping but also by using particular tools such as the \"Bungee\" and \"Ninja Rope\", to move to otherwise inaccessible areas. Each turn is time-limited to ensure that players do not hold up the game with excessive thinking or moving. The time limit can be modified in some of the games in the Worms series.\n\nOver fifty weapons and tools may be available each time a game is played, and differing selections of weapons and tools can be saved into a \"scheme\" for easy selection in future games. Other scheme settings allow options such as deployment of reinforcement crates, from which additional weapons can be obtained, and sudden death where the game is rushed to a conclusion after a time limit expires. Some settings provide for the inclusion of objects such as land mines and explosive barrels.\n\nWhen most weapons are used, they cause explosions that deform the terrain, creating circular cavities. If a worm is hit with a weapon, they will lose health. A worm who is out of health will die by blowing themselves up and leaving a grave marker. Worms can also die by being thrown off the side of the map or by falling into the water at the map's base.\n\n==Development==\nThe game was originally created by Andy Davidson as an entry for a [[Blitz BASIC]] programming competition run by the ''[[Amiga Format]]'' magazine, a cut-down version of the [[programming language]] having been covermounted previously. The game at this stage was called '''''Total Wormage''''' (possibly in reference to ''[[Total Carnage]]'') and it did not win the competition. Davidson sent the game to several publishers with no success. He then took the game to the [[European Computer Trade Show]], where he met with Mark Foreman \u2013 Head Games Buyer at GEM Distribution. Mark suggested to Andy that he should speak to Ocean/Team17 as they would be an ideal partner \u2013 they also had a stand at the show. Team17 made an offer on-the-spot to develop and publish the game.<ref>IGN [ Worms Blast Preview]</ref><ref>GameSpy [ Worms: Open Warfare Developer Diary]</ref>\n\nDuring the development of ''Worms 2'', Andy Davidson wrote ''Worms \u2013 The Director's Cut'', a special edition produced exclusively for the AGA chipset Amiga. Only 5000 copies were ever sold. It was also the last version released for the Commodore Amiga platform from which the game originated.\n\nThe references to the developers' home county, [[Yorkshire]], is visible, with a soundbank named \"Tykes\", which is a Yorkshire accent, and in the \"Hell\" level found in the single player mission mode, a sign with \"Welcome to [[Ossett]]! Ha! ha! ha!\" written on it.\n\nThe North American release of the [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]] version was the subject of considerable negotiation, as Sony Computer Entertainment of America had a policy against 2D games being published for the console. The [[Sega Saturn]] version of the game was a straight port of the PlayStation version.\n\nIn 1995, Team17 began development on a port of ''Worms'' to [[Nintendo]]'s [[Virtual Boy]] platform.<ref name=\"MMan\u00edav3i8\">{{cite magazine|author=|url=https://archive.org/stream/MicromaniaTerceraEpocaSpanishIssue8#page/n57/mode/1up|title=Reportaje: Extra\u00f1a mezcla... de gusanos - Worms|magazine=[[Microman\u00eda]]|volume=3|issue=8|publisher=HobbyPress|date=September 1995|page=58|lang=es}}</ref> The game was to be published by Ocean, but was canceled only weeks into development as a result of Nintendo's discontinuation of the console.<ref>[http://www.vr32.de/modules/games/?u030 VR32.de] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090322181752/http://www.vr32.de/modules/games/?u030 |date=2009-03-22 }}</ref> A [[32X]] release was also planned but never released as well.<ref name=\"MMan\u00edav3i8\"/>\n\nAn [[Atari Jaguar]] version was also developed by Team17 and published by [[Telegames]] in May 15, 1998.<ref>{{cite magazine|last=Charlton|first=Frank|url=http://www.stformat.com/stf85/pages_nx1500/stf85_010.jpg|title=STF News... - Worms wriggles in|magazine=[[ST Format]]|issue=85|publisher=[[Future plc]]|date=August 1996|page=10}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Smith|first=Jason|url=http://www.jaguarsector.com/index.php?autocom=ibwiki&cmd=article&do=print_article&id=379|title=Atari Jaguar Timeline|website=jaguarsector.com|accessdate=2018-09-13|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130629025431/http://www.jaguarsector.com/index.php?autocom=ibwiki&cmd=article&do=print_article&id=379|archivedate=29 June 2013|url-status=live}}</ref> Telegames announced the release of this version after becoming the last remaining software publisher for the Jaguar and like other games published following the system's discontinuation,<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://retrocdn.net/index.php?title=File%3AEGM_US_094.pdf&page=24|title=Tidbits...|magazine=[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]|issue=94|publisher=[[Ziff Davis]]|date=May 1997|page=24}}</ref> ''Worms'' could be purchased either through [[Direct selling|direct order]] from Telegames' US and UK websites or select retailers such as [[EB Games|Electronics Boutique]].<ref>{{cite magazine|last=|first=|url=https://retrocdn.net/index.php?title=File:GamePro_US_105.pdf&page=22|title=News Bits|magazine=[[GamePro]]|issue=105|publisher=[[International Data Group|IDG]]|date=June 1997|page=20}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://archive.org/stream/Gamefan_Vol_5_Issue_10#page/n41|title=Recent Sightings of an Endangered Species|magazine=[[GameFan]]|volume=5|issue=10|publisher=Shinno Media|date=October 1997|page=36}}</ref> It also served as the final title released for the console to be officially licensed with the Atari name, as the rights to said name and other [[intellectual property]] rights of [[Atari Corporation]] were sold to [[Hasbro Interactive]] before [[JT Storage]]'s bankruptcy in [[1999 in video gaming|1999]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.host.fptoday.com/melek/jaguar/jag-96.htm|title=Hasbro Interactive Acquires Legendary Atari Game Property Assets|website=Nine Lives|date=March 16, 1998|accessdate=2018-12-02|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051107232949/http://www.host.fptoday.com/melek/jaguar/jag-96.htm|archivedate=7 November 2005|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n===Character, level and sound design===\nThe game's graphics and sound design is primarily 'cartoon-like' (though less so than the later games in the series). Levels designs are randomly generated by the use of alpha-numeric strings as their [[Random seed|seeds]]. The object and landscape sets used to generate the field are arranged into 'themes' including forests, martian landscapes, beaches and 'hell'.\n\n==Remake==\n''Worms'' is the first in the [[Worms (series)|''Worms series'']] of games. A [[Video game remake|remake]], also called ''[[Worms (2007 video game)|Worms]]'', for the Xbox 360 was released in 2007. It has since been released to the PS3, in April 2009, and on the [[iPhone]] on July 11, 2009.\n\n==Worms Reinforcements==\n''Worms Reinforcements'' ([[1996 in video gaming|1996]]) is an expansion pack for ''Worms'', which was later amalgamated with the original game to create ''Worms and Reinforcements United'' (a.k.a. ''Worms United'' or ''Worms Utd.'') the same year. Released only for the [[personal computer|PC]], it added a single player campaign and the ability to add custom levels and soundpacks (which was already available for the [[Amiga]] version). It also included an introductory FMV.\n\n==Worms: The Director's Cut==\n''[[Worms: The Director's Cut]]'' ([[1997 in video gaming|1997]]) is a sequel to ''Worms'', available only on the Amiga. It is largely built upon the original Amiga game engine with various gameplay enhancement and additions, as well as graphical improvements and fixes.\n\n== Reception ==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"float:right; font-size:80%; text-align:center; margin:1em; margin-top:0; padding:0; background:none;\" cellpadding=\"0\"\n! colspan=10 style=\"font-size: 100%\" | Reception\n|-\n! colspan=10 | Aggregate scores\n|-\n! rowspan=2  | Aggregator\n! colspan=10 | Scores\n|-\n!

Reviewing the Saturn version, ''[[Sega Saturn Magazine]]'' especially praised Worms's unexpected complexity and the fun of multiplayer mode, and called it \"Quite simply the most playable game to hit the Saturn so far.\"<ref name=\"SSMukSSw\"/>\n\n''Maximum'' commented that \"Basically, ''Worms'' is ''Lemmings'', but it's without the puzzles and with weapons instead.\" While firmly stating that they found the game dull and unappealing, they acknowledged that it was clearly well-liked by gamers.<ref name=\"MaximumSSw\"/><ref name=\"MaximumSSw/>\n\nA ''[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]'' critic argued while the game resembles ''Lemmings'' on a cursory examination, in actuality it is much more similar to ''Cannon Fodder''. Praising the need for both strategy and skill, the multiplayer design, and the randomly generated landscapes, he described ''Worms'' as \"the kind of game that makes no excuses for its lack of texture-mapped polygons or its minimalist gameplay. ''Worms'' is a fun game with an infectious spirit and near endless replay value.\"<ref name=\"NGenPSw\"/><ref name=\"NGenSSw\"/>\n\nCoach Kyle of ''[[GamePro]]'' summarized that \"A humorous concept never really pays off in ''Worms''.\" He criticized that the tiny size of the characters and their weapons makes them unappealing and even hard to make out. While allowing that the use of the different weapons is interesting at first, he found the action too slow-paced and repetitive to maintain interest.<ref name=\"GProSSw\"/>\n\nThe four reviewers of ''[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]'' commented that \"Some games have great graphics and control, but ''Worms'' doesn't need either because the fun factor is a 10+. With multiplayer ability of up to four people, ''Worms'' is one of those games that is so unique, it doesn't fit into any category - except innovative and incredibly addictive.\"<ref name=\"EGMSSw\"/> They later named it one of their \"Top 5 Most Original Games of 1996\".<ref>{{cite magazine|title=Top 5 Most Original Games of 1996|magazine=[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]|issue=91|publisher=[[Ziff Davis]] |date=February 1997|page=152}}</ref>\n\n''[[GameSpot]]'' criticized the slowness of large multiplayer sessions and the imprecision of the keyboard controls, but, like ''Sega Saturn Magazine'', they lauded the combination of surface simplicity and underlying complexity, summarizing that \"Like the board game [[Othello (game)|Othello]], ''Worms'' takes only a few minutes to learn, but may take a lifetime to master.\"<ref name=\"GSpotPCw\"/>\n\nConversely, the ''[[Amiga Power]]'' review, written in the style of a magazine personality quiz, whilst praising the detail of the animation, described frustrating imbalances especially in relation to the vaunted 16-player multi-player mode and was critical of the puerility of the game's humour.<ref name=\"APA500w\"/>\n\n''Electronic Gaming Monthly'' named ''Worms'' a runner-up for Strategy Game of the Year (behind ''[[Dragon Force]]'').<ref>{{cite magazine |title=The Best of '96|magazine=[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]] |issue=92|publisher=[[Ziff Davis]]|date=March 1997|page=88}}</ref>\n\n{{clear}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n*{{official website|http://worms.team17.com/}} ''Worms'' series\n*{{MobyGames|id=/worms|name=''Worms''}}\n*[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08C-ttHHKFs Total Wormage trailer]\n\n{{Team17}}\n{{Virtual Boy}}\n{{Worms series}}\n{{Portal bar|1990s|United Kingdom|Video games}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Worms (1995 video game)}}\n[[Category:Worms games| 01]]\n[[Category:1995 video games]]\n[[Category:Ocean Software games]]\n[[Category:Video games developed in the United Kingdom]]\n[[Category:Video games with expansion packs]]\n[[Category:Games commercially released with DOSBox]]\n[[Category:Amiga games]]\n[[Category:Artillery video games]]\n[[Category:Atari Jaguar games]]\n[[Category:Cancelled Sega 32X games]]\n[[Category:Cancelled Virtual Boy games]]\n[[Category:CD32 games]]\n[[Category:DOS games]]\n[[Category:Game Boy games]]\n[[Category:PlayStation (console) games]]\n[[Category:Sega Genesis games]]\n[[Category:Sega Saturn games]]\n[[Category:Strategy video games]]\n[[Category:Super Nintendo Entertainment System games]]\n[[Category:Team17]]\n[[Category:Telegames games]]\n[[Category:Video games scored by Allister Brimble]]\n", "name_user": "KGRAMR", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eReception", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Worms_(1995_video_game)"}

Born in [[Sheffield]], he supported [[Sheffield Wednesday F.C.|Sheffield Wednesday]] as a child, and started his playing career there. Before he made a league appearance for Sheffield Wednesday, he transferred to [[Leeds United F.C.|Leeds United]] and made more than 200 appearances. After this he joined Bradford City for a then club-record fee of \u00a31.4&nbsp;million and played every minute of every match in his first season for the club. Relegation from the [[Premier League]] soon followed and the club went into [[administration (law)|administration]] in 2002 but when [[Stuart McCall]] departed for [[Sheffield United F.C.|Sheffield United]], Wetherall became the [[captain (association football)|team captain]]. Wetherall missed several games through injury in the seasons that followed and Bradford City were further relegated to [[Football League One|League One]] in 2004 and then to [[Football League Two|League Two]] in 2007. He played his final game in professional football on 3 May 2008 against [[Wycombe Wanderers F.C.|Wycombe Wanderers]].\n\nWetherall had two spells as [[caretaker manager]] of Bradford City, and was an integral part of club's coaching setup following his retirement as a player. He left Bradford in June 2011 after 12 years with the club to take up a position with [[the Football League]]. He was inducted into [[Show Racism The Red Card]]'s [[hall of fame]] for his involvement in their [[anti-racism]] campaign.\n\n==Playing career==\n\n===Early life and career===\nWetherall was born in Sheffield.<ref name=Hugman/> He was [[cap (sport)|capped]] by England at schoolboy level,<ref name=Hugman/> and in 1989, when he left school, he signed for [[Sheffield Wednesday F.C.|Sheffield Wednesday]] under the management of [[Howard Wilkinson]].

Born in [[Sheffield]], he supported [[Sheffield Wednesday F.C.|Sheffield Wednesday]] as a child, and started his playing career there. Before he made a league appearance for Sheffield Wednesday, he transferred to [[Leeds United F.C.|Leeds United]] and made more than 200 appearances. After this he joined Bradford City for a then club-record fee of \u00a31.4&nbsp;million and played every minute of every match in his first season for the club. Relegation from the [[Premier League]] soon followed and the club went into [[administration (law)|administration]] in 2002 but when [[Stuart McCall]] departed for [[Sheffield United F.C.|Sheffield United]], Wetherall became the [[captain (association football)|team captain]]. Wetherall missed several games through injury in the seasons that followed and Bradford City were further relegated to [[Football League One|League One]] in 2004 and then to [[Football League Two|League Two]] in 2007. He played his final game in professional football on 3 May 2008 against [[Wycombe Wanderers F.C.|Wycombe Wanderers]].\n\nWetherall had two spells as [[caretaker manager]] of Bradford City, and was an integral part of club's coaching setup following his retirement as a player.
