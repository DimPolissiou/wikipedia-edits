The campaign took a significant turning point in 2008 when the newly formed Liverpool LGBT Network voted that establishing a permanent Pride in the city would be one of its key priorities.{{cite web|url= http://www.liverpool-community.org.uk/minutes/lesbian-gay-bisexual-and-transgender/32-lesbian-gay-bisexual-and-transgender-140608.pdf |title=Link }}  At the height of Liverpool's year as [[European Capital of Culture]] it was felt that staging a successful festival to rival those of other large UK cities was a realistic and attainable goal.  Later in the year, the movement began to gather pace and was bolstered by a renewed sense of urgency and determination following the high-profile homophobic murder of Michael Causer on the outskirts of the city.\n\nA motion in support of Liverpool Pride was put before a full meeting of Liverpool City Council by Labour Councillor Nick Small on 28 January 2009, and was approved by 74 votes to 2.<ref>[http://www.lgf.org.uk/news/956/590/Liverpool-Pride-Edges-Closer/ Lesbian and Gay Foundation, 5 February 2009]</ref>  The City Council stated that the festival would \u2018celebrate the city\u2019s diversity, be an opportunity to raise money for charitable causes and boost the city\u2019s visitor and night time economies\u2019{{cite web|url= http://councillors.liverpool.gov.uk/Published/C00000305/M00008134/$$$Agenda.doc.pdf |title=Link }}.   \n[[File:Liverpool Gay Quarter Pride 2011.jpg|200px|right|thumb|Liverpool Gay Quarter Pride, Stanley Street, 6 August 2011]]\nThe first official Pride was successfully held in the [[Liverpool Gay Quarter|gay quarter]] in 2010, centered on Dale Street and Stanley Street,<ref>{{cite web|last=Writer |first=Staff |url=http://www.pinknews.co.uk/2010/08/09/first-liverpool-pride-a-success/ |title=\"First Liverpool Pride \u2018a success\", Pink News, 9th August 2010 |publisher=Pinknews.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2012-03-29}}</ref> however, in 2011 due to a funding shortfall the controversial decision was taken to relocate the main focus of the festival to the city's [[Pier Head]].<ref>{{cite web|author=Alan Weston |url=http://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/liverpool-news/local-news/2011/06/29/liverpool-pride-festival-moves-from-the-city-s-gay-quarter-to-pier-head-100252-28958153/ |title=\"Liverpool Pride festival moves from the city\u2019s gay quarter to Pier Head\", Liverpool Echo |publisher=Liverpoolecho.co.uk |date=29 June 2011 |accessdate=2012-03-29}}</ref>  Following this announcement, a public backlash ensued and sections of the local LGBT community planned to boycott the event.<ref>{{cite web|author=twentyfirstcentury |url=http://www.midlandszone.co.uk/news.asp?thisId=1959&thisName=Liverpools-relocated-Pride-facing-boycott-&newsindx=National-and-World-News&idxid=5/ |title=\"Liverpool's relocated Pride facing boycott\", Midlands Zone, 29th June 2011 |publisher=Midlandszone.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2012-03-29}}</ref>  In quick response to the anger and disappointment expressed by the community and in an attempt to salvage the situation, more than 30 businesses around Stanley Street (including the Liverpool Gay Village Business Association) rallied together in an unprecedented move and organised a complementary festival to take place in the gay district alongside the main event.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.clickliverpool.com/business/business-features/1213984-over-30-businesses-sign-up-for-first-ever-stanley-street-pride-party.html |title=Over 30 businesses sign up for first ever Stanley Street Pride Party > Business Features > Business |publisher=Click Liverpool |date=3 August 2011 |accessdate=2012-03-29}}</ref>\n\nDespite the overall festival proving successful in the end with visitor numbers doubling,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.clickliverpool.com/culture/culture/1214022-liverpool-pride-2011-boasts-a-record-breaking-40,000-visitors.html |title=Liverpool Pride 2011 boasts a record breaking 40,000 visitors > Culture > Culture |publisher=Click Liverpool |date= |accessdate=2012-03-29}}</ref> organisers came under heavy criticism from openly gay councillor [[Steve Radford]] and chair of the Village Business Association, who accused the Pride committee of \"running itself aloof from the Gay Quarter and not listening to the needs of the gay community and local businesses.\"  In an interview with Seen Magazine (a local LGBT publication), Liverpool Pride responded with claims that only a small number of local gay businesses had actually supported the event.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.seenmag.co.uk/news-and-features/exclusive-pride-debate.phuse |title=Seen Magazine, EXCLUSIVE Pride Debate |publisher=Seen Magazine |date= |accessdate=2012-05-24}}</ref>\n\nBy 2012, lessons had been learned and a much more coherent and unified approach was adopted.  The Pride committee pledged that a presence would be maintained around the gay quarter thanks to a close working partnership with the Village Business Association, the collective that had organised Stanley Street Pride in 2011.  Furthermore, a number of new people elected to Liverpool Pride's Board of Trustees had proven experience as organisers of the Stanley Street Pride the previous year, which meant dialogue between the local gay scene and the main Pride organisers would be much more constructive and free-flowing.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/liverpool-life/liverpool-lifestyle/2012/01/13/i-attended-the-liverpool-pride-agm-on-tuesday-and-came-away-from-it-a-happy-man-100252-30113855 |title=I ATTENDED the Liverpool Pride AGM on Tuesday and came away from it a happy man |publisher=Andy Green, Out and About, Liverpool Echo |date= |accessdate=2012-05-24}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.liverpoolpride.co.uk/news/23/11/2011/liverpool-pride-returns-2012 |title=Liverpool Pride returns for 2012 |publisher=Liverpool Pride |date= |accessdate=2012-05-24}}</ref>\n\nWhilst Liverpool held its first \"Official\" Pride in 2010, it was not first ever in the city.

Moreover, Pride in the early 90s tended to concentrate more on arts, exhibitions, culture, talks, workshops and function evenings, in contrast to the party on the scene/popstar on stage format as seen today.  The events also had a strong political element and aimed to explore and challenge society's attitudes towards sexuality at that time.  To put it into perspective, gay men still faced an unequal [[Ages of consent in Europe|age of consent]], the infamous [[Section 28]] was still in existence, there would be no partnership or adoption rights for same sex couples for at least another decade whilst [[OutRage!]], a UK based LGBT activist group, was just being formed.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/2551523.stm |title=Timeline: Gay fight for equal rights |publisher=BBC News |accessdate=2012-05-28 |date=6 December 2002}}</ref>  Highlights of the festivals included discussions on women in the church, [[LGBT parenting]] and [[Gay literature|literature]], support for gay and lesbian victims of sexual abuse and health awareness workshops.  T-shirts and badges bearing the Pride logos were sold in local gay venues and at events themselves to help cover running costs (see brochure of events below).\n\nThe celebration took a brief break but returned in 1995 under the new name 'Mersey Pride', an attempt to create a more outdoor cabaret and stage type atmosphere around Pownall Square, chosen for its close proximity to The Brunswick and Time Out, two popular gay frequented pubs of the day.  The occasion was modestly successful as a political statement and was attended by some 1200 revellers from across North West England, albeit attracting noticeable protests from the [[Christian right]].<ref>http://www.qrd.org/qrd/world/europe/uk/scotland/pulse/37-09.95</ref>\n\nIn many ways, Liverpool Lesbian & Gay Pride of the early 90s paved the way for [[Homotopia Liverpool (festival)|Homotopia]], the city's modern day gay arts festival launched some 12 years later, in the sense that Homotopia took on a similar formula.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/local/liverpool/hi/people_and_places/history/newsid_8730000/8730769.stm |title=Liverpool's journey to Gay Pride |publisher=BBC Liverpool |accessdate=2012-05-24 |date=11 June 2010}}</ref>  The Mersey Pride of 1995, however, bore a stronger resemblance to the present day festivities at the Pier Head and Gay Quarter in spite of being significantly smaller and much less mainstream.\n\n<gallery>\nImage:Liverpool Lesbian & Gay Pride 1990 Brochure.gif|Liverpool Lesbian & Gay Pride Brochure 1990\nImage:Liverpool goes to London Pride 1990.jpg|Liverpool goes to London Pride 1990\nImage:Tea Dance Ticket.jpg|Tea Dance Ticket from Liverpool Lesbian & Gay Pride 1990\nImage:Liverpool Lesbian & Gay Pride 1991 Brochure.gif|Liverpool Lesbian & Gay Pride Brochure 1991\nImage:Liverpool Lesbian & Gay Pride Poster 1991.jpg|Liverpool Lesbian & Gay Pride 1991 Poster\nImage:Liverpool Lesbian & Gay Pride T-Shirt 1991.jpg|Liverpool Lesbian & Gay Pride 1991 T-shirt\nImage:Coach ticket to London Pride 1991.jpg|Coach ticket to London Pride 1991\nImage:Liverpool Lesbian & Gay Pride 1990 & 1991 Badges.jpg|Badges from Liverpool Lesbian & Gay Pride 1990 & 1991\nImage:Liverpool Lesbian & Gay Pride 1992 Brochure.gif|Liverpool Lesbian & Gay Pride Brochure 1992\nImage:Liverpool Lesbian & Gay Pride 1992 Poster.jpg|Liverpool Lesbian & Gay Pride 1992 Poster\nImage:Liverpool Lesbian & Gay Pride 1992 T-Shirt.jpg|Liverpool Lesbian & Gay Pride 1992 T-shirt\nImage:Pride flyer for benefit night at Jody's.jpg|Benefit night at Jody's, Liverpool Lesbian & Gay Pride 1992 \nImage:Liverpool Pride 1992 tea dance programme.gif|Liverpool Lesbian & Gay Pride 1992 tea dance programme\nFile:Liverpool Lesbian & Gay Pride 1995.gif|Liverpool Lesbian & Gay Pride 1995\n</gallery>\n\n==Liverpool Gay Pride 1979==\n\nThe first recorded Liverpool Pride commenced on 22 June 1979 and consisted of a week long celebration in remembrance of the New York [[Stonewall riots]], which took place in the June some ten years earlier.

The campaign took a significant turning point in 2008 when the newly formed Liverpool LGBT Network voted that establishing a permanent Pride in the city would be one of its key priorities.{{cite web|url= http://www.liverpool-community.org.uk/minutes/lesbian-gay-bisexual-and-transgender/32-lesbian-gay-bisexual-and-transgender-140608.pdf |title=Link }}  At the height of Liverpool's year as [[European Capital of Culture]] it was felt that staging a successful festival to rival those of other large UK cities was a realistic and attainable goal.

Moreover, Pride in the early 90s tended to concentrate more on arts, exhibitions, culture, talks, workshops and function evenings, in contrast to the party on the scene/popstar on stage format as seen today.  The events also had a strong political element and aimed to explore and challenge society's attitudes towards sexuality at that time.  To put it into perspective, gay men still faced an unequal [[Ages of consent in Europe|age of consent]], the infamous [[Section 28]] was still in existence, there would be no partnership or adoption rights for same sex couples for at least another decade whilst [[OutRage!]], a UK based LGBT activist group, was just being formed.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/2551523.stm |title=Timeline: Gay fight for equal rights |publisher=BBC News |accessdate=2012-05-28 |date=6 December 2002}}</ref>  Highlights of the festivals included discussions on women in the church, [[LGBT parenting]] and [[Gay literature|literature]], support for gay and lesbian victims of sexual abuse and health awareness workshops.  T-shirts and badges bearing the Pride logos were sold in local gay venues and at events themselves to help cover running costs (see brochure of events below).\n\nThe celebration took a brief break but returned in 1995 under the new name 'Mersey Pride', an attempt to create a more outdoor cabaret and stage type atmosphere around Pownall Square, chosen for its close proximity to The Brunswick and Time Out, two popular gay frequented pubs of the day.

Much of this was grounded in the hostility felt by the largely Catholic poor for the Anglo-Irish gentry, which was mainly Anglican. In post-famine Ireland, anti-English hostility was adopted into the philosophy and foundation of the Irish nationalist movement. At the turn of the twentieth century, the Celtic Revival movement associated the search for a cultural and national identity with increasing anti-colonial and anti-English sentiment.\n\nA feeling of anti-English sentiment intensified within Irish nationalism during the Boer War leading to xenophobia underlined by Anglophobia. In 2011, tensions and anti-English or anti-British feelings flared in relation to the proposed state visit of [[Queen Elizabeth II]], the first British monarch to visit Ireland in 101 years. A republican demonstration was held at the GPO Dublin by a group of Irish Republicans on 26 February 2011, and a mock trial and decapitation of an effigy of Queen Elizabeth II were carried out by socialist republican group \u00c9ir\u00edg\u00ed.

In May 1942, when conditions were highly problematic for British prospects, American journalist [[Edward R.

He attributed it especially to:\n:partly the hard-core of anglophobes (Irish, Germans and isolationists); partly the frustration produced by war without early victories; partly our bad behaviour at Singapore; and partly the tendency common to all countries at war to blame their allies for doing nothing.<ref>Diary entry of 11 May 1942 in Nigel Nicolson, ed.

Much of this was grounded in the hostility felt by the largely Catholic poor for the Anglo-Irish gentry, which was mainly Anglican. In post-famine Ireland, anti-English hostility was adopted into the philosophy and foundation of the Irish nationalist movement. At the turn of the twentieth century, the Celtic Revival movement associated the search for a cultural and national identity with increasing anti-colonial and anti-English sentiment.\n\nA feeling of anti-English sentiment intensified within Irish nationalism during the Boer War leading to xenophobia underlined by Anglophobia. In 2011, tensions and anti-English or anti-British feelings flared in relation to the proposed state visit of [[Queen Elizabeth II]], the first British monarch to visit Ireland in 101 years. A republican demonstration was held at the GPO Dublin by a group of Irish Republicans on 26 February 2011, and a mock trial and decapitation of an effigy of Queen Elizabeth II were carried out by socialist republican group \u00c9ir\u00edg\u00ed.

He attributed it especially to:\n:partly the hard-core of anglophobes (Irish, Germans and isolationists); partly the frustration produced by war without early victories; partly our bad behaviour at Singapore; and partly the tendency common to all countries at war to blame their allies for doing nothing.<ref>Diary entry of 11 May 1942 in Nigel Nicolson, ed.

By the age of fifteen, he had the ability to accompany leading musicians at nightclubs, working regularly at Copenhagen's [[Jazzhus Montmartre]], after his debut there on New Year's Eve 1961, when he was only 15. When seventeen, he had already turned down an offer to join the [[Count Basie]] orchestra, mainly because he was too young to get legal permission to live and work as a musician in the United States.\n\nThe Montmartre was a regular stop-off for touring American Jazz stars, and as a member of the house band, the young \u00d8rsted Pedersen performed with saxophonists such as [[Sonny Rollins]], [[Dexter Gordon]], [[Rahsaan Roland Kirk]] and [[Stan Getz]], and pianist [[Bill Evans]], with whom he toured in Europe in 1965. During the 1960s, \u00d8rsted Pedersen played with a series of other important American jazzmen who were touring or resident in Denmark, including [[Ben Webster]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.statsbiblioteket.dk/search/showrecord.jsp?record_id=sb_3197543|title=''\u00d8rsted Pedersen Recording With Ben Webster 1965\u201371''|publisher=Danish National Library, statsbiblioteket.dk|accessdate=2010-10-13}}</ref> [[Brew Moore]], [[Bud Powell]], [[Count Basie]], [[Roy Eldridge]], [[Dizzy Gillespie]], [[Jackie McLean]], and vocalist [[Ella Fitzgerald]].

He also worked with [[St\u00e9phane Grappelli]] and [[Joe Pass]] and recorded extensively as a leader. His best known songs are \"My Little Anna\", \"Jaywalkin'\", and \"The Puzzle\", as well as jazz arrangements of traditional Danish folk songs. A duo performance with [[Rune Gustafsson]] at [[Vossajazz]] 1980, concluded on the album ''Just The Way You Are'' on the label Sonet Gramofon, recorded half a year after this first meeting. He was awarded the [[Nordic Council Music Prize]] in 1991. This was the first time this prize for composition was awarded to a performing musician, and this must be ascribed to his great international standing. He was presumably the most sought-after Danish instrumentalist internationally ever, and had traveled and recorded with a series of the greatest jazz soloists internationally.\n\n\u00d8rsted Pedersen also had a particular ability to interpret Danish songs and folk melodies. He often played within trio ensembles, partly collectively with the trumpeter [[Palle Mikkelborg]] and the keyboard player [[Kenneth Knudsen]], and partly under his own name, usually with guitarists like [[Philip Catherine]] and [[Ulf Wakenius]]. In 1999, he co-led a duo with pianist [[Mulgrew Miller]], touring Europe, Japan, Australia, and Korea. This format was later enlarged into a trio featuring drummer [[Alvin Queen]]. This trio remained intact until Pedersen's death.<ref name=politiken/>\n\n== Death ==\n\n\u00d8rsted Pedersen died of heart failure in 2005 at the age of 58 in [[Copenhagen]], Denmark.
