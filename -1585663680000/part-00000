Dungan]] and written by Madras Kandaswamy Mudaliar. It is based on [[S. S. Vasan]]'s novel of the same name, which had been [[Serial (literature)|serialised]] in 1934. [[M. K. Radha]] stars as Krishnamurthy, a man from [[Chennai|Madras]], who is lured into drinking alcohol by an acquaintance. Believing he murdered his friend in a drunken stupor, Krishnamurthy flees to [[Sri Lanka|Ceylon]] while his wife and daughter, played by M. R. Gnanambal and M. K. Mani respectively, are reduced to poverty. [[T. S. Balaiah]], [[M. G. Ramachandran]], [[M. V. Mani]] and P. Nammalvar appear in supporting roles.\n\nA. N. Marudachalam Chettiar initially wanted to produce a film version of the Madurai Original Boys Company (MOBC) play ''Pathi Bhakthi'', but realised [[Pathi Bhakthi|an adaptation]] was already being made. Chettiar then learnt about Vasan's novel, which had a similar plot and obtained the rights to make a film version. ''Sathi Leelavathi'' was Dungan's directorial debut and the film-acting debuts of Radha, Balaiah, Ramachandran and [[K. A. Thangavelu]]. It was [[N. S. Krishnan]]'s first film appearance, but his second release. The film was mostly shot at Vel Pictures Studio in Madras. D. T. Telang and V. J. Shave were the cinematographers, and the film was co-edited by Dungan and Sircar.\n\n''Sathi Leelavathi'' explores themes of [[Temperance movement in India|temperance]], social reform, the [[Gandhism|Gandhian]] concept of selfless service and the plight of labourers. It was one of the earliest Tamil films to be involved in a plagiarism controversy; the MOBC accused Chettiar and Mudaliar of plagiarising their play. The case was resolved after Vasan testified that both the play and the novel were based on ''Danesbury House'', an 1860 novel written by [[Ellen Wood (author)|Ellen Wood]], so neither party could claim originality. The film premiered on 1 February 1936 in Madras and was released theatrically on 28 March. It was a commercial success and made Dungan a sought-after director. Several features of his direction, including shooting by schedule, camera mobility, cabaret dances and less-theatrical acting, became staples of [[Tamil cinema]]. No complete print of the film is known to survive, making it a [[List of incomplete or partially lost films|partially lost film]].\n\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n== Plot ==\nKrishnamurthy is a wealthy man who lives in [[Chennai|Madras]] with his wife Leelavathi and their daughter Lakshmi. At a mock tea party, Krishnamurthy's acquaintance Ramanathan persuades him to drink alcohol. Ramanathan's collaborator is Rangiah Naidu, a corrupt police inspector. Krishnamurthy becomes infatuated by Mohanangi, a promiscuous woman, and promises to pay her {{INR}}50,000 (about US$18,700 in 1936).{{efn|name=exchange1936}}\n\nParasuraman, Krishnamurthy's friend, tries but fails to reform him. A [[Marwari people|Marvadi]] man who lent money to Krishnamurthy obtains a [[Warrant of payment|repayment warrant]], sinking Krishnamurthy deeper in debt. Krishnamurthy drunkenly accuses Leelavathi of having an affair with Parasuraman. When Parasuraman arrives at Krishnamurthy's house while he is absent, Leelavathi warns him to leave. Parasuram leaves but forgets his umbrella. Krishnamurthy comes home drunk, sees the umbrella, assaults Leelavathi and goes out to shoot Parasuraman. Meanwhile, Ramanathan sends his servant disguised as Parasuraman to steal the treasuries of the [[Ekambareswarar Temple, Chennai|Ekambareswarar Temple]].\n\nKrishnamurthy chases Ramanathan's servant, whom he thinks is Parasuraman; a shot is heard, and the servant is killed. After coming to his senses, Krishnamurthy thinks he has murdered Parasuraman and decides to escape, leaving Leelavathi and Lakshmi in the custody of his servant Govindan. Krishnamurthy flees to [[Sri Lanka|Ceylon]], where he leads a wretched life as a labourer on a [[Tea processing|tea estate]]. Ramanathan makes advances to Leelavathi, who spurns him. Penniless, she goes with Govindan and Lakshmi, and works as a ''[[Spinning wheel#Charkha|charkha]]'' spinner. Krishnamurthy finds treasure and gives it to his master, who is pleased and adopts him as his son.\n\nKrishnamurthy returns to his family in Madras but is arrested for Parasuraman's murder. Detective Sreenivasan's investigation reveals the malicious intent of Ramanathan and Rangiah, and he produces the real Parasuraman in court. Parasuraman reveals himself, proving Krishnamurthy's innocence. Ramanathan had been secretly following the drunken Krishnamurthy, who passed out and dropped his gun. When the servant came out, Ramanathan picked up the gun, shot the servant and placed it in Krishnamurthy's hand. Krishnamurthy is acquitted, Ramanathan is sentenced to death, and Rangiah receives seven years' imprisonment. Lakshmi and Parasuraman's son Chandrakanthan marry.<ref name=\"pressbook\" />\n\n== Cast ==\n<!-- Credits adapted from the pressbook: http://tamildigitallibrary.in/admin/assets/book/TVA_BOK_0008620_%E0%AE%9A%E0%AE%A4%E0%AE%BF-%E0%AE%B2%E0%AF%80%E0%AE%B2%E0%AE%BE%E0%AE%B5%E0%AE%A4%E0%AE%BF.pdf -->\n{{Col-begin|width=80%}}\n{{col-break|width=20%}}\n;Male cast<ref name=\"pressbook\" />\n* [[M.

In ''Silver Screen'' magazine on 1 August 1936, Pe. Ko. Sundararajan (journalist and writer for ''[[Manikkodi|Manikodi]]'') said the new methods of depicting emotions were not understood by the audience; in one scene, Dungan showed the dancing girl as seen by the inebriated protagonist, and in another he indicated his fear by depicting his twitching fingers and feet. According to Sundararajan, the techniques helped the actors to emote and showcased Dungan's talent; however, the audience thought the lighting in the first scene was poor and that the film was stuck in the second. He opined that this reflected their ignorance.{{sfn|Baskaran|2004|p=39}}\n\n== Legacy ==\n''Sathi Leelavathi'' attained cult status in Tamil cinema<ref>{{Cite news |last=Guy |first=Randor |url=https://www.thehindu.com/features/cinema/cinema-columns/punjab-kesari-1938/article5973131.ece |title=''Punjab Kesari'' 1938 |date=3 May 2014 |work=[[The Hindu]] |access-date=16 October 2018 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181016102149/https://www.thehindu.com/features/cinema/cinema-columns/punjab-kesari-1938/article5973131.ece |archive-date=16 October 2018 |author-link=Randor Guy}}</ref> and made Dungan an in-demand director.<ref name=\"IE SathiLeelavathi\" /><ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.frontline.in/arts-and-culture/dungan-the-director/article5492566.ece |title=Dungan the director |date=10 January 2014 |work=[[Frontline (magazine)|Frontline]] |access-date=8 October 2018 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://archive.today/20141126025215/http://www.frontline.in/arts-and-culture/dungan-the-director/article5492566.ece |archive-date=26 November 2014}}</ref> The techniques introduced by Dungan in the film became staples of Tamil cinema.<ref name=\"George\" />{{sfn|Guy|1997|p=177}} Footage about the making of ''Sathi Leelavathi'' was later included in ''[[An American in Madras]]'', a documentary about Dungan's career in India.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Chatterji |first=Shoma A. |url=https://www.tribuneindia.com/2014/20140126/spectrum/entertainment1.htm |title=A fascinating documentary |date=26 January 2014 |work=[[The Tribune (Chandigarh)]] |access-date=24 October 2018 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://archive.today/20181024114955/https://www.tribuneindia.com/2014/20140126/spectrum/entertainment1.htm |archive-date=24 October 2018}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |last=Vijayan |first=Naveena |url=https://www.newindianexpress.com/cities/chennai/2014/aug/16/American-Touch-to-Tamil-Cinema-648420.html |title=American Touch to Tamil Cinema |date=16 August 2014 |work=[[The New Indian Express]] |access-date=17 November 2019 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191117132408/https://www.newindianexpress.com/cities/chennai/2014/aug/16/American-Touch-to-Tamil-Cinema-648420.html |archive-date=17 November 2019}}</ref>\n\n''Sathi Leelavathi'' was the first Tamil film to be successful in overseas markets.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Venkateswaran |first=N. |url=http://epaper.timesofindia.com/Repository/getFiles.asp?Style=OliveXLib:LowLevelEntityToPrintGifMSIE_PASTISSUES2&Type=text/html&Locale=english-skin-custom&Path=TOICH/2011/03/20&ChunkNum=0&ID=Ar00200 |title=The chronicler of Kollywood |date=20 March 2011 |work=[[The Times of India]] |access-date=14 October 2018 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://archive.today/20181014031543/http://epaper.timesofindia.com/Repository/getFiles.asp?Style=OliveXLib:LowLevelEntityToPrintGifMSIE_PASTISSUES2&Type=text/html&Locale=english-skin-custom&Path=TOICH/2011/03/20&ChunkNum=0&ID=Ar00200 |archive-date=14 October 2018}}</ref> According to film historian Swarnavel Eswaran Pillai, despite Vasan's initial aversion to films,{{sfn|Guy|1997|p=241}} ''Sathi Leelavathi''{{'}}s success encouraged him to enter the industry as a distributor.{{sfn|Pillai|2015|p=152}} Ramachandran avoided playing roles similar to Rangiah Naidu in his later films, preferring to play a \"good Samaritan\" in ''[[Marmayogi]]'' (1951), ''[[Malaikkallan]]'' (1954), ''[[Nadodi Mannan]]'' (1958) and ''[[Enga Veettu Pillai]]'' (1965).<ref>{{Cite news |last=Venkatramani |first=S.

Dungan]] and written by Madras Kandaswamy Mudaliar. It is based on [[S. S. Vasan]]'s novel of the same name, which had been [[Serial (literature)|serialised]] in 1934. [[M. K. Radha]] stars as Krishnamurthy, a man from [[Chennai|Madras]], who is lured into drinking alcohol by an acquaintance. Believing he murdered his friend in a drunken stupor, Krishnamurthy flees to [[Sri Lanka|Ceylon]] while his wife and daughter, played by M. R. Gnanambal and M. K. Mani respectively, are reduced to poverty. [[T. S. Balaiah]], [[M. G. Ramachandran]], [[M. V. Mani]] and P. Nammalvar appear in supporting roles.\n\nA. N. Marudachalam Chettiar initially wanted to produce a film version of the Madurai Original Boys Company (MOBC) play ''Pathi Bhakthi'', but realised [[Pathi Bhakthi|an adaptation]] was already being made. Chettiar then learnt about Vasan's novel, which had a similar plot and obtained the rights to make a film version. ''Sathi Leelavathi'' was Dungan's directorial debut and the film-acting debuts of Radha, Balaiah, Ramachandran and [[K. A. Thangavelu]]. It was [[N. S. Krishnan]]'s first film appearance, but his second release. The film was mostly shot at Vel Pictures Studio in Madras. D. T. Telang and V. J. Shave were the cinematographers, and the film was co-edited by Dungan and Sircar.\n\n''Sathi Leelavathi'' explores themes of [[Temperance movement in India|temperance]], social reform, the [[Gandhism|Gandhian]] concept of selfless service and the plight of labourers. It was one of the earliest Tamil films to be involved in a plagiarism controversy; the MOBC accused Chettiar and Mudaliar of plagiarising their play. The case was resolved after Vasan testified that both the play and the novel were based on ''Danesbury House'', an 1860 novel written by [[Ellen Wood (author)|Ellen Wood]], so neither party could claim originality. The film premiered on 1 February 1936 in Madras and was released theatrically on 28 March. It was a commercial success and made Dungan a sought-after director. Several features of his direction, including shooting by schedule, camera mobility, cabaret dances and less-theatrical acting, became staples of [[Tamil cinema]]. No complete print of the film is known to survive, making it a [[List of incomplete or partially lost films|partially lost film]].\n\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n== Plot ==\nKrishnamurthy is a wealthy man who lives in [[Chennai|Madras]] with his wife Leelavathi and their daughter Lakshmi. At a mock tea party, Krishnamurthy's acquaintance Ramanathan persuades him to drink alcohol. Ramanathan's collaborator is Rangiah Naidu, a corrupt police inspector. Krishnamurthy becomes infatuated by Mohanangi, a promiscuous woman, and promises to pay her {{INR}}50,000 (about US$18,700 in 1936).{{efn|name=exchange1936}}\n\nParasuraman, Krishnamurthy's friend, tries but fails to reform him. A [[Marwari people|Marvadi]] man who lent money to Krishnamurthy obtains a [[Warrant of payment|repayment warrant]], sinking Krishnamurthy deeper in debt. Krishnamurthy drunkenly accuses Leelavathi of having an affair with Parasuraman. When Parasuraman arrives at Krishnamurthy's house while he is absent, Leelavathi warns him to leave. Parasuram leaves but forgets his umbrella. Krishnamurthy comes home drunk, sees the umbrella, assaults Leelavathi and goes out to shoot Parasuraman. Meanwhile, Ramanathan sends his servant disguised as Parasuraman to steal the treasuries of the [[Ekambareswarar Temple, Chennai|Ekambareswarar Temple]].\n\nKrishnamurthy chases Ramanathan's servant, whom he thinks is Parasuraman; a shot is heard, and the servant is killed. After coming to his senses, Krishnamurthy thinks he has murdered Parasuraman and decides to escape, leaving Leelavathi and Lakshmi in the custody of his servant Govindan. Krishnamurthy flees to [[Sri Lanka|Ceylon]], where he leads a wretched life as a labourer on a [[Tea processing|tea estate]]. Ramanathan makes advances to Leelavathi, who spurns him. Penniless, she goes with Govindan and Lakshmi, and works as a ''[[Spinning wheel#Charkha|charkha]]'' spinner. Krishnamurthy finds treasure and gives it to his master, who is pleased and adopts him as his son.\n\nKrishnamurthy returns to his family in Madras but is arrested for Parasuraman's murder. Detective Sreenivasan's investigation reveals the malicious intent of Ramanathan and Rangiah, and he produces the real Parasuraman in court. Parasuraman reveals himself, proving Krishnamurthy's innocence. Ramanathan had been secretly following the drunken Krishnamurthy, who passed out and dropped his gun. When the servant came out, Ramanathan picked up the gun, shot the servant and placed it in Krishnamurthy's hand. Krishnamurthy is acquitted, Ramanathan is sentenced to death, and Rangiah receives seven years' imprisonment. Lakshmi and Parasuraman's son Chandrakanthan marry.<ref name=\"pressbook\" />\n\n== Cast ==\n<!-- Credits adapted from the pressbook: http://tamildigitallibrary.in/admin/assets/book/TVA_BOK_0008620_%E0%AE%9A%E0%AE%A4%E0%AE%BF-%E0%AE%B2%E0%AF%80%E0%AE%B2%E0%AE%BE%E0%AE%B5%E0%AE%A4%E0%AE%BF.pdf -->\n{{Col-begin|width=80%}}\n{{col-break|width=20%}}\n;Male cast<ref name=\"pressbook\" />\n* [[M.

In ''Silver Screen'' magazine on 1 August 1936, Pe. Ko.

According to Sundararajan, the techniques helped the actors to emote and showcased Dungan's talent; however, the audience thought the lighting in the first scene was poor and that the film was stuck in the second.

They also stated that while pressured to include ''Armageddon'' and ''Godzilla'' on the Worst Picture ballot, they ultimately felt that ''Blues Brothers 2000'' was more deserving. They then admitted that if they expanded the Worst Picture category to ten films, they would have added ''Armaggeddon'', ''Babe: Pig in the City'', ''Godzilla'', ''Krippendorf's Tribe'', and ''Meet the Deedles'' to the ballot. Lancaster put ''Lost in Space'' as the one 1998 film among his five worst movies of the 1990s, alongside ''[[It's Pat]]'', ''[[Kids (film)|Kids]]'', ''[[Nothing but Trouble (1991 film)|Nothing but Trouble]]'', and ''[[Ready to Wear]]''.<ref>{{cite web |title=Q & A with the Stinkers |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20010413025218/http://thestinkers.com/qanda.html |website=The Stinkers |accessdate=29 September 2019}}</ref>\n\nListed as follows are the different categories with their respective winners and nominees, including Worst Picture and its dishonourable mentions, which are films that were considered for Worst Picture but ultimately failed to make the final ballot (37 total).

They also stated that while pressured to include ''Armageddon'' and ''Godzilla'' on the Worst Picture ballot, they ultimately felt that ''Blues Brothers 2000'' was more deserving. They then admitted that if they expanded the Worst Picture category to ten films, they would have added ''Armaggeddon'', ''Babe: Pig in the City'', ''Godzilla'', ''Krippendorf's Tribe'', and ''Meet the Deedles'' to the ballot. Lancaster put ''Lost in Space'' as the one 1998 film among his five worst movies of the 1990's, alongside ''[[It's Pat]]'', ''[[Kids (film)|Kids]]'', ''[[Nothing but Trouble (1991 film)|Nothing but Trouble]]'', and ''[[Ready to Wear]]''.<ref>{{cite web |title=Q & A with the Stinkers |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20010413025218/http://thestinkers.com/qanda.html |website=The Stinkers |accessdate=29 September 2019}}</ref>\n\nListed as follows are the different categories with their respective winners and nominees, including Worst Picture and its dishonourable mentions, which are films that were considered for Worst Picture but ultimately failed to make the final ballot (37 total).

{"title_page": "History of Peru", "text_new": "{{History of Peru}}\nThe '''history of Peru''' spans 4 millennia, extending back through several stages of cultural development in the mountain region and the lakes. [[Peru]] was home to the [[Norte Chico civilization]], the oldest civilization in the [[Americas]] and one of the six oldest in the world, and to the [[Inca Empire]], the largest and most advanced state in [[pre-Columbian]] America. It was conquered by the [[Spanish Empire]] in the 16th century, which established a [[Viceroyalty of Peru|Viceroyalty]] with jurisdiction over most of its [[South American]] domains. The nation declared [[Independence of Peru|independence]] from Spain in 1821, but consolidated only after the [[Battle of Ayacucho]] three years later.\n\n==Pre-Columbian cultures==\n{{see also|Cultural periods of Peru}}\n{{multiple image|perrow=2|total_width=360|caption_align=center\n| title = [[Andean civilizations]] of Peru\n| image1 = PeruCaral01.jpg|caption1=[[Norte Chico civilization|Norte Chico]] Caral pyramids in the arid Supe Valley, some 20 kilometers distanted from the Pacific coast.\n| image2 = Chavinmuseolarco.jpg|caption2=[[Chav\u00edn culture|Chavin]] Gold Crown [[Cultural periods of Peru|Formative Epoch]] 1200\u2013300 BCE ([[Larco Museum|Larco Museum Collection]], [[Nazca Lines]], created by the [[Nazca culture]].\n| image4 = Condormuseolarco.jpg|caption4=The [[Moche culture]] is world-renowned for its pottery, in picture a [[Andean condor|condor]] from about 300 CE.\n| image5 = Ruinas-soloco chachapoyas amazonas peru.jpg|caption5=Walls of Soloco fortress, [[Chachapoyas culture|Chachapoyas]], Peru.\n| image6 = Piquillacta Archaeological site - street.jpg|caption6=Pikillaqta administrative center, built by the [[Wari culture]] in [[Cusco]].\n| image7 = Vasija chim\u00fa caballito de totora (M.

Over the next three thousand years, inhabitants switched from nomadic lifestyles to cultivating land, as evidenced from sites such as [[Jiskairumoko]], [[Kotosh|Kotosh,]] and [[Huaca Prieta]]. Cultivation of plants such as [[Maize|corn]] and [[Gossypium|cotton]] (''Gossypium barbadense'') began, as well as the domestication of animals such as the wild ancestors of the [[llama]], the [[alpaca]] and the [[guinea pig]], as seen in the 6000 BC dated [[Camelid]] relief paintings in the Mollepunko caves in [[Callalli District|Callalli]]. Inhabitants practiced [[Spinning (textiles)|spinning]] and [[knitting]] of cotton and wool, [[Basket weaving|basketry]], and [[pottery]].\n\nAs these inhabitants became sedentary, farming allowed them to build settlements. As a result, new societies emerged along the coast and in the Andean mountains. The first known city in the Americas was [[Caral]], located in the [[Supe District|Supe Valley]] 200&nbsp;km north of Lima. It was built in approximately 2500 BC.<ref name=\"Mann\"/>\n\nThe remnants of this civilization, also known as [[Norte Chico civilization|Norte Chico]], consists of approximately 30 pyramidal structures built up in receding terraces ending in a flat roof; some of them measuring up to 20 meters in height.

The [[Paracas culture]] emerged on the southern coast around 300 BC. They are known for their use of [[vicu\u00f1a]] fibers instead of just [[cotton]] to produce fine [[textile]]s\u2014innovations that did not reach the northern coast of Peru until centuries later. Coastal cultures such as the [[Moche (culture)|Moche]] and [[Nazca culture|Nazca]] flourished from about 100 BC to about AD 700: the Moche produced impressive metalwork, as well as some of the finest [[pottery]] seen in the ancient world, while the Nazca are known for their textiles and the enigmatic [[Nazca lines]].\n\nThese coastal cultures eventually began to decline as a result of recurring ''[[el Ni\u00f1o]]'' floods and droughts. In consequence, the [[Huari culture|Huari]] and [[Tiwanaku]], who dwelt inland in the [[Andes]], became the predominant cultures of the region encompassing much of modern-day Peru and [[Bolivia]]. They were succeeded by powerful [[city-state]]s such as [[Chancay]], [[Sipan]], and [[Cajamarca]], and two empires: [[Chimor]] and [[Chachapoyas culture|Chachapoyas]]. These cultures developed relatively advanced techniques of [[Tillage|cultivation]], gold and silver craft, [[pottery]], [[metallurgy]], and [[knitting]]. Around 700 BC, they appear to have developed systems of social organization that were the precursors of the [[Inca Empire|Inca]] civilization.\n\nIn the highlands, both the [[Tiwanaku|Tiahuanaco]] culture, near [[Lake Titicaca]] in both Peru and [[Bolivia]], and the [[Wari culture]], near the present-day city of [[Ayacucho]], developed large urban settlements and wide-ranging state systems between 500 and 1000 AD.<ref>Peru [http://countrystudies.us/peru/2.htm Pre-Inca Cultures]. Retrieved 27 July 2014.</ref>\n\nNot all Andean cultures were willing to offer their loyalty to the Incas as they expanded their empire because many were openly hostile.

It dominated a territory that included (from north to south): the southwest part of [[Ecuador]], part of [[Colombia]], the main territory of [[Peru]], the northern part of [[Chile]], and the northwest part of [[Argentina]]; and from east to west, from the southwest part of [[Bolivia]] to the [[Amazon Rainforest|Amazonian forests]].\n\nThe empire originated from a tribe based in [[Cusco]], which became the capital. Pachacutec wasn't the first Inca, but he was the first ruler to considerably expand the boundaries of the [[Cusco Region|Cusco]] state. He could probably be compared to [[Alexander the Great]] (from Macedon), [[Julius Caesar]] (of the Roman Empire), [[Attila]] (from the Huns tribes) and [[Genghis Khan]] (from the Mongol Empire).{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}} His offspring later ruled an empire by both violent invasions and peaceful conquests, that is, intermarriages among the rulers of small kingdoms and the current Inca ruler.\n\nIn [[Cusco (Department of Peru)|Cuzco]], the royal city was created to resemble a [[cougar]]; the head, the main royal structure, formed what is now known as [[Sacsayhuam\u00e1n]]. The empire's administrative, political, and military center was located in Cusco. The empire was divided into four quarters: [[Chinchaysuyu]], [[Antisuyu]], [[Kuntisuyu]] and [[Qullasuyu]].\n\nThe official language was [[Quechua language|Quechua]]. It was the language of a neighbouring tribe of the original tribe of the empire. Conquered populations\u2014tribes, kingdoms, states, and cities\u2014were allowed to practice their own religions and lifestyles, but had to recognize Inca cultural practices as superior to their own. [[Inti]], the sun god, was to be worshipped as one of the most important gods of the empire. His representation on earth was the Inca (\"Emperor\").{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\nThe [[Tawantinsuyu]] was organized in dominions with a stratified society, in which the ruler was the Inca. It was also supported by an economy based on the collective property of the land. The empire, being quite large, also had an impressive transportation system of roads to all points of the empire called the [[Inca road system|Inca Trail]], and [[chasquis]], message carriers who relayed information from anywhere in the empire to Cusco.\n\n[[Machu Picchu]] (Quechua for \"old peak\"; sometimes called the \"Lost City of the Incas\") is a well-preserved pre-Columbian Inca ruin located on a high mountain ridge above the [[Urubamba Valley]], about 70&nbsp;km (44&nbsp;mi) northwest of Cusco. Elevation measurements vary depending on whether the data refers to the ruin or the extremity of the mountain; Machu Picchu tourist information reports the elevation as 2,350&nbsp;m (7,711&nbsp;ft)[1]. Forgotten for centuries by the outside world (although not by locals), it was brought back to international attention by Yale archaeologist [[Hiram Bingham III]]. Bingham, often cited as the inspiration for Indiana Jones, \"scientifically rediscovered\" the site in 1911 and brought international attention to the site with his best-selling book ''Lost City of the Incas''. Peru is pursuing legal efforts to retrieve thousands of artifacts that Bingham removed from the site and sold to the current owners at Yale University.<ref>{{cite news\n|url = https://www.nytimes.com/2007/06/24/magazine/24MachuPicchu-t.html?pagewanted=1&ei=5088&en=5ef3ca602130ba03&ex=1340337600&partner=rssnyt&emc=rss\n|title = The Possessed\n|accessdate = 2007-07-14\n|last = Lubow\n|first = Arthur\n|date = June 24, 2007\n|newspaper = New York Times\n|page = 10\n}}</ref>\n\nAlthough Machu Picchu is by far the most well known internationally, Peru boasts of many other sites where the modern visitor can see extensive and well-preserved ruins, remnants of the Inca-period and even older constructions. Much of the Inca architecture and stonework found at these sites continues to confound archaeologists. For example, at [[Sacsayhuam\u00e1n|Sacsaywaman]] in Cusco, the zig-zag-shaped walls are composed of massive boulders fitted very precisely to one another's irregular, angular shapes. No mortar holds them together, but nonetheless they have remained absolutely solid through the centuries, surviving earthquakes that flattened many of the colonial constructions of Cusco. Damage to the walls visible today was mainly inflicted during battles between the Spanish and the Inca, as well as later, in the colonial era. As Cusco grew, the walls of Sacsaywaman were partially dismantled, the site becoming a convenient source of construction materials for the city's newer inhabitants. It is still not known how these stones were shaped and smoothed, lifted on top of one another (they really are ''very'' massive), or fitted together by the Incas; we also do not know how they transported the stones to the site in the first place. The stone used is not native to the area and most likely came from mountains many kilometers away.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\n==European colonization of Peru (1532\u20131572)==\n{| class=\"toccolours\" style=\"float:right; margin-left:1em; margin-right:0; font-size:85%; background:#e7edf5; width:28em; max-width:35%;\" cellspacing=\"5\"\n| style=\"text-align: left;\" | '''The etymology of ''Peru'':''' The word ''Peru'' may be derived from ''Bir\u00fa'', the name of a local ruler who lived near the [[Bay of San Miguel]], [[Panama]], in the early 16th century.<ref>Porras Barrenechea (1968) p. 83</ref> When his possessions were visited by Spanish explorers in 1522, they were the southernmost part of the New World yet known to Europeans.<ref>Porras Barrenechea (1968) p. 84</ref> Thus, when [[Francisco Pizarro]] explored the regions farther south, they came to be designated Bir\u00fa or Peru.<ref>Porras Barrenechea (1968) p. 86.</ref>\n\nAn alternative history is provided by the contemporary writer Inca Garcilasco de la Vega, son of an Inca princess and a conquistador.

''The Conquest of the Inca''. New York: Harcourt, Inc., 1970, 28\u201329.</ref> Taking advantage of this, [[Pizarro]] carried out a ''[[coup d'\u00e9tat]]''. On 16 November 1532, while the Atahualpa's victorious army was in an unarmed celebration in [[Cajamarca (city)|Cajamarca]], the Spanish lured Atahualpa into a trap during the [[Battle of Cajamarca]]. The well-armed 168 Spaniards killed thousands of barely armed Inca soldiers and captured the newly minted Inca ruler, causing a great consternation among the natives and conditioning the future course of the fight. When Hu\u00e1scar was killed, the Spanish tried and convicted Atahualpa of the murder, executing him by strangulation.\n\nFor a period, Pizarro maintained the ostensible authority of the [[Inca]], recognizing [[T\u00fapac Huallpa]] as the [[Sapa Inca]] after Atahualpa's death. But the conqueror's abuses made this facade too obvious. Spanish domination consolidated itself as successive indigenous rebellions were bloodily repressed. By 23 March 1534, Pizarro and the Spanish had re-founded the Inca city of Cuzco as a new Spanish colonial settlement.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\nEstablishing a stable colonial government was delayed for some time by native revolts and bands of the ''[[Conquistadores]]'' (led by Pizarro and [[Diego de Almagro]]) fighting among themselves. A long civil war developed, from which Pizarro emerged victorious at the [[Battle of Las Salinas]]. In 1541, Pizarro was assassinated by a faction led by [[Diego de Almagro II]] (''El Mozo''), and the stability of the original colonial regime was shaken up in the ensuing [[civil war]].\n\n[[Image:Pizarro in Lima.JPG|thumb|left|Pizarro and his followers in Lima in 1535]]\nDespite this, the Spaniards did not neglect the colonizing process. Its most significant milestone was the foundation of [[Lima]] in January 1535, from which the political and administrative institutions were organized. The new rulers instituted an [[encomienda|''encomienda'' system]], by which the Spanish extracted tribute from the local population, part of which was forwarded to [[Seville]] in return for converting the natives to Christianity. Title to the land itself remained with the [[king of Spain]]. As governor of Peru, Pizarro used the ''encomienda'' system to grant virtually unlimited authority over groups of native Peruvians to his soldier companions, thus forming the colonial land-tenure structure. The indigenous inhabitants of Peru were now expected to raise [[Old World]] [[cattle]], [[poultry]], and crops for their landlords. Resistance was punished severely, giving rise to the \"[[Black legend (Spain)|Black Legend]]\".\n\nThe necessity of consolidating Spanish royal authority over these territories led to the creation of a [[Real Audiencia]] (Royal Audience). The following year, in 1542, the [[Viceroyalty of Peru]] (''Virreinato del Per\u00fa'') was established, with authority over most of Spanish-ruled South America. ([[Colombia]], [[Ecuador]], [[Panam\u00e1]] and [[Venezuela]] were split off as the [[Viceroyalty of New Granada]] (''Virreinato de Nueva Granada'') in 1717; and [[Argentina]], [[Bolivia]], [[Paraguay]], and [[Uruguay]] were set up as the [[Viceroyalty of the R\u00edo de la Plata]] in 1776).{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\nAfter Pizarro's death, there were numerous internal problems, and Spain finally sent [[Blasco N\u00fa\u00f1ez Vela]] to be Peru's first viceroy in 1544. He was later killed by Pizarro's brother, [[Gonzalo Pizarro]], but a new viceroy, [[Pedro de la Gasca]], eventually managed to restore order. He captured and executed Gonzalo Pizarro.\n\nA census taken by the last [[Quipu|Quipucamayoc]] indicated that there were 12 million inhabitants of Inca Peru; 45 years later, under viceroy Toledo, the census figures amounted to only 1,100,000 Inca. Historian David N. Cook estimates that their population decreased from an estimated 9 million in the 1520s to around 600,000 in 1620 mainly because of [[infectious disease]]s.<ref>Noble David Cook, ''Demographic collapse: Indian Peru, 1520\u20131620'', p. 114.</ref> While the attrition was not an organized attempt at [[genocide]], the results were similar.

He also sought economic development through commercial monopoly and mineral extraction, mainly from the silver mines of [[Potos\u00ed]]. He reused the Inca ''[[Mita (Inca)|mita]]'', a forced labor program, to mobilize native communities for mining work. This organization transformed Peru into the principal source of Spanish wealth and power in South America.\n\nThe town of [[Lima]], founded by Pizarro on 18 January 1535 as the \"Ciudad de Reyes\" (City of Kings), became the seat of the new viceroyalty. It grew into a powerful city, with jurisdiction over most of Spanish South America. Precious metals passed through Lima on their way to the [[Isthmus of Panama]] and from there to [[Seville, Spain]]. By the 18th century, Lima had become a distinguished and aristocratic colonial capital, seat of a university and the chief Spanish stronghold in the Americas.\n\nNevertheless, throughout the eighteenth century, further away from Lima in the provinces, the Spanish did not have complete control. The Spanish could not govern the provinces without the help of local elite. This local elite, who governed under the title of Curaca, took pride in their Incan history. Additionally, throughout the eighteenth century, indigenous people rebelled against the Spanish. Two of the most important rebellions were that of [[Juan Santos Atahualpa]] in 1742 in the Andean jungle provinces of [[Tarma]] and [[Jauja]], and Rebellion of [[T\u00fapac Amaru II]] in 1780 around the highlands near Cuzco.\n\nAt the time, an economic crisis was developing due to creation of the Viceroyalties of [[Viceroyalty of New Granada|New Granada]] and [[Viceroyalty of the R\u00edo de la Plata|Rio de la Plata]] (at the expense of its territory), the duty exemptions that moved the commercial center from [[Lima]] to [[Caracas]] and [[Buenos Aires]], and the decrease of the mining and textile production. This crisis proved favorable for the indigenous rebellion of T\u00fapac Amaru II and determined the progressive decay of the Viceroyalty of Peru.\n\nIn 1808, Napoleon invaded the [[Iberian Peninsula]] and took the king, [[Ferdinand VII of Spain|Ferdinand VII]], hostage. Later in 1812, the [[Cortes of C\u00e1diz|Cad\u00edz Cortes]], the national legislative assembly of Spain, promulgated a liberal [[Spanish Constitution of 1812|Constitution of Cadiz]]. These events inspired emancipating ideas between the [[Criollo people|Spanish Criollo people]] throughout the Spanish America. In Peru, the Creole rebellion of [[Hu\u00e1nuco (Department of Peru)|Hu\u00e1nuco]] arose in 1812 and the rebellion of [[Cusco (Department of Peru)|Cuzco]] arose between 1814 and 1816. Despite these rebellions, the [[Criollo people|Criollo]] oligarchy in Peru remained mostly Spanish loyalist, which accounts for the fact that the [[Viceroyalty of Peru]] became the last redoubt of the Spanish dominion in South America.\n\n==Wars of independence (1811\u20131824)==\n[[Image:La Independencia del Per\u00fa.jpg|thumb|right|Jos\u00e9 de San Mart\u00edn's proclamation of the independence of Peru on July 28, 1821 in [[Lima]], [[Peru]].

San Mart\u00edn, who had displaced the royalists of Chile after the [[Battle of Chacabuco]], and who had disembarked in [[Paracas Peninsula|Paracas]] in 1819, led the military campaign of 4,200 soldiers. The expedition, which included warships, was organized and financed by Chile which sailed from [[Valpara\u00edso]] in August 1820.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Simon Collier|author2=William F.

San Mart\u00edn opted for a constitutional monarchy, whilst Bolivar (Head of the Northern Expedition) opted for a republican. Nonetheless, they both followed the notion that it was to be independent of Spain. Following the interview, San Martin abandoned Peru on 22 September 1822 and left the whole command of the independence movement to Simon Bolivar. \n[[File:Batalla de Jun\u00edn.jpg|thumb|250px|Battle of Jun\u00edn, 6 August 1824]]\n\nThe Peruvian congress named Bolivar dictator of Peru on 10 February 1824, which allowed him to reorganize the political and military administration completely. Assisted by general [[Antonio Jos\u00e9 de Sucre]], Bol\u00edvar decisively defeated the Spanish [[cavalry]] at the [[Battle of Jun\u00edn]] on 6 August 1824. Sucre destroyed the still numerically superior remnants of the Spanish forces at [[Battle of Ayacucho|Ayacucho]] on 9 December 1824. The war would not end until the last royalist holdouts surrendered the [[Real Felipe Fortress]] in 1826. \n\nThe victory brought about political independence, but there remained indigenous and [[mestizo]] supporters of the monarchy and in [[Huanta Province]], they rebelled in 1825\u201328, which is known as ''the war of the punas'' or the Huanta Rebellion.<ref>Ceclia M\u00e9ndez, ''The Plebeian Republic: The Huanta Rebellion and the Making of the Peruvian State, 1820\u20131850''.

An attempt to unite Peru and [[Bolivia]] was made during the period 1836\u20131839 by Bolivian President [[Andres de Santa Cruz]] when the [[Peru-Bolivian Confederation]] came into existence. Severe internal opposition led to its demise in the [[War of the Confederation]] which dovetailed into a Peruvian attempt to annex Bolivia by [[Agust\u00edn Gamarra]] that ultimately failed and turned into a protracted war.<ref>{{cite book |last= Werlich |first= David P. |title= Peru \u2014 a short history |publisher= [[Southern Illinois University Press]] |year= 1978 |pages= [https://archive.org/details/perushorthistory00werl/page/70 70\u201372] |isbn= 0-8093-0830-4 |url-access= registration |url= https://archive.org/details/perushorthistory00werl/page/70 }}</ref>\n\nPeru embarked on a railroad-building program. The American entrepreneur [[Henry Meiggs]] built a standard gauge line from [[Callao]] across the Andes to the interior, [[Huancayo]]; he built the line and controlled its politics for a while; in the end, he bankrupted himself and the country. President [[Tom\u00e1s Guardia Guti\u00e9rrez|Tom\u00e1s Guardia]] contracted with Meiggs in 1871 to build a railroad to the Atlantic. Financial problems forced the government to take over in 1874. The labor conditions were complex, with conflicts arising from different levels of skill and organization among the North Americans, Europeans, Blacks, and the Chinese. Conditions were very brutal for the Chinese, and led to strikes and violent suppression.<ref>Watt Stewart, ''Henry Meiggs: Yankee Pizarro'' (1946)</ref>\n\n[[File:Batalla en guerra del Pacifico (1879-1883).png|thumb|1882\u201383 Sierra Campaign]]\nIn 1879, Peru entered the [[War of the Pacific]] which lasted until 1884. Bolivia invoked its alliance with Peru against Chile. The [[Peruvian Government]] tried to mediate the dispute by sending a diplomatic team to negotiate with the Chilean government, but the committee concluded that war was inevitable. On 14 March 1879, Bolivia declared war and Chile, in response, declared war on Bolivia and Peru on 5 April 1879 with Peru following with its own declaration of war the next day. Almost five years of war ended with the loss of the department of [[Tarapac\u00e1 Region|Tarapac\u00e1]] and the provinces of [[Tacna]] and [[Arica]], in the Atacama region.\n\nOriginally, Chile committed to a referendum for the cities of Arica and Tacna to be held years later, in order to determine their national affiliation. However, Chile refused to apply the treaty, and both countries could not determine the statutory framework. In an arbitrage that both countries admitted, the United States decided that the plebiscite was impossible to take, therefore, direct negotiations between the parties led to a treaty ([[Treaty of Lima]], 1929), in which [[Arica]] was ceded to Chile and [[Tacna]] remained in Peru. Tacna was returned to Peru on 29 August 1929. The territorial loss and the extensive looting of Peruvian cities by Chilean troops left scars on the country's relations with Chile that have not yet fully healed.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\nFollowing the [[Ecuadorian-Peruvian War]] of 1941, the [[Rio Protocol]] sought to formalize the boundary between those two countries. [[History of the Ecuadorian-Peruvian territorial dispute|Ongoing boundary disagreements]] led to a brief war in early 1981 and the [[Cenepa War]] in early 1995, but in 1998, the governments of both countries signed an historic peace treaty that clearly demarcated the international boundary between them. In late 1999, the governments of Peru and Chile implemented the last outstanding article of their 1929 border agreement.\n\n===Aristocratic Republic (1884\u20131930)===\n[[File:Borders Chile 1879 and 2006 SP.png|thumb|200px|Chile's territorial gains after the War of the Pacific]]\nAfter the [[War of the Pacific]], an extraordinary effort of rebuilding began. The government started to initiate a number of social and economic reforms in order to recover from the damage of the war. Political stability was achieved only in the early 1900s.\n\nIn 1894, [[Nicol\u00e1s de Pi\u00e9rola]], after allying his party with the [[Civilista Party|Civil Party]] of Peru to organize guerrilla fighters to occupy Lima, ousted [[Andr\u00e9s Avelino C\u00e1ceres]] and once again became president of Peru in 1895. After a brief period in which the military once again controlled the country, civilian rule was permanently established with Pierola's election in 1895. His second term was successfully completed in 1899 and was marked by his reconstruction of a devastated Peru by initiating fiscal, military, religious, and civil reforms. Until the 1920s, this period was called the \"Aristocratic Republic\", since most of the presidents that ruled the country were from the social elite.\n\nDuring [[Augusto B. Legu\u00eda]]'s periods in government (1908\u20131912 and 1919\u20131930), the latter known as the \"Oncenio\" (the \"Eleventh\"), the entrance of American capital became general and the [[bourgeoisie]] was favored. This policy, along with increased dependence on foreign investment, focused opposition from the most progressive sectors of Peruvian society against the landowner oligarchy.\n\nThere was a final peace treaty in 1929, signed between Peru and Chile and called the [[Treaty of Lima]] by which Tacna returned to Peru and Peru yielded permanently the formerly rich provinces of Arica and Tarapac\u00e1, but kept certain rights to the port activities in Arica and restrictions on what Chile can do on those territories.\n\nIn 1924, from [[Mexico]], university reform leaders in Peru who had been forced into exile by the government founded the [[American People's Revolutionary Alliance|American People's Revolutionary Alliance (ARPA)]], which had a major influence on the country's political life. APRA is largely a political expression of the university reform and workers' struggles of the years 1918\u20131920. The movement draws its influences from the [[Mexican revolution]] and its [[1917 Constitution]], particularly on issues of [[agrarianism]] and [[indigenism]], and to a lesser extent from the Russian revolution. Close to [[Marxism]] (its leader, [[Haya de la Torre]], declares that \"APRA is the Marxist interpretation of the American reality\"), it nevertheless moves away from it on the question of class struggle and on the importance given to the struggle for the political unity of Latin America.<ref>Latin America in the 20th century: 1889\u20131929, 1991, p. 314-319</ref>\n\nIn 1928, the [[Peruvian Socialist Party]] was founded, notably under the leadership of [[Jos\u00e9 Carlos Mari\u00e1tegui]], himself a former member of APRA. Shortly afterwards, in 1929, the party created the [[General Confederation of Workers (Mexico)|General Confederation of Workers]].\n\n=== Alternation between democracy and militarism (1930\u20131979) ===\nAfter the worldwide crisis of 1929, numerous brief governments followed one another. The APRA party had the opportunity to cause system reforms by means of political actions, but it was not successful. This was a nationalistic movement, populist and anti-imperialist, headed by [[V\u00edctor Ra\u00fal Haya de la Torre|Victor Raul Haya de la Torre]] in 1924. The Socialist Party of Peru, later the [[Peruvian Communist Party]], was created four years later and it was led by [[Jos\u00e9 Carlos Mari\u00e1tegui|Jose C. Mariategui]].\n\nRepression was brutal in the early 1930s and tens of thousands of APRA followers (''Apristas'') were executed or imprisoned. This period was also characterized by a sudden population growth and an increase in urbanization. According to [[Alberto Flores Galindo]], \"By the 1940 census, the last that utilized racial categories, [[mestizo]]s were grouped with whites, and the two constituted more than 53 percent of the population. Mestizos likely outnumbered the indigenous peoples and were the largest population group.\"<ref>{{Cite book\n| last = Galindo\n| first = Alberto Flores \n| title = In Search of an Inca: Identity and Utopia in the Andes\n| publisher = Cambridge University Press\n| year = 2010\n| page = 247\n| isbn = 0-521-59861-3\n}}\n</ref> On 12 February 1944, Peru was [[Allies of World War II#After the Declaration by United Nations|one of the South American nations]] \u2013 following [[Brazilian Expeditionary Force#Overview|Brazil]] on 22 August 1942, [[Bolivia]] on 7 April 1943 and [[Colombia]] on 26 July 1943 to align with the [[Allies of World War II|Allied forces]] against the Axis.\n\nFollowing the Allied victory in [[World War II]] by 2 September 1945, [[V\u00edctor Ra\u00fal Haya de la Torre]] (founder of the APRA), together with [[Jos\u00e9 Carlos Mari\u00e1tegui]] (leader of the [[Peruvian Communist Party]]), were two major forces in Peruvian politics. Ideologically opposed, they both managed to create the first political parties that tackled the social and economic problems of the country. Although Mari\u00e1tegui died at a young age, Haya de la Torre was twice elected president, but prevented by the military from taking office. During World War II, the country rounded up around 2,000 of its Japanese immigrant population and shipped them to the United States as part of the [[Japanese-American internment]] program.<ref>[[Agence France-Presse]]/[[Jiji Press]], \"Peru sorry for World War II internments\", ''[[Japan Times]]'', 16 June 2011, p. 2.</ref>\n\nPresident [[Jos\u00e9 Bustamante y Rivero|Bustamante y Rivero]] hoped to create a more democratic government by limiting the power of the military and the oligarchy. Elected with the cooperation of the APRA, conflict soon arose between the President and Haya de la Torre. Without the support of the APRA party, Bustamante y Rivero found his presidency severely limited. The President disbanded his ''Aprista'' cabinet and replaced it with a mostly military one. In 1948, Minister [[Manuel A. Odria]] and other [[right-wing]] elements of the Cabinet urged Bustamante y Rivero to ban the APRA, but when the President refused, Odr\u00eda resigned his post.\n\nIn a military coup on 29 October, Gen. [[Manuel A. Odria]] became the new President. Odr\u00eda's presidency was known as the ''Ochenio''. He came down hard on APRA, momentarily pleasing the oligarchy and all others on the right, but followed a [[Populism|populist]] course that won him great favor with the poor and lower classes. A thriving economy allowed him to indulge in expensive but crowd-pleasing social policies. At the same time, however, [[civil rights]] were severely restricted and [[political corruption|corruption]] was rampant throughout his r\u00e9gime.\n\nIt was feared that his dictatorship would run indefinitely, so it came as a surprise when Odr\u00eda allowed new elections. During this time, [[Fernando Bela\u00fande Terry]] started his political career, and led the slate submitted by the National Front of Democratic Youth. After the National Election Board refused to accept his candidacy, he led a massive protest, and the striking image of Bela\u00fande walking with the flag was featured by news magazine ''[[Caretas]]'' the following day, in an article entitled \"As\u00ed Nacen Los Lideres\" (\"Thus Are Leaders Born\"). Bela\u00fande's 1956 candidacy was ultimately unsuccessful, as the dictatorship-favored right-wing candidacy of [[Manuel Prado Ugarteche]] took first place.\n\nBela\u00fande ran for president once again in the national elections of 1962; this time with his own party, [[Popular Action (Spain)|Acci\u00f3n Popular]] (Popular Action). The results were very tight; he ended in second place, following V\u00edctor Ra\u00fal Haya de la Torre (APRA), by less than 14,000 votes. Since none of the candidates managed to get the constitutionally established minimum of one third of the vote required to win outright, selection of the President should have fallen to Congress; the long-held antagonistic relationship between the military and APRA prompted Haya de la Torre to make a deal with former dictator Odria, who had come in third, which would have resulted in Odria taking the Presidency in a coalition government.\n\nHowever, widespread allegations of fraud prompted the Peruvian military to depose Prado and install a military ''junta'', led by [[Ricardo P\u00e9rez Godoy|Ricardo Perez Godoy]]. Godoy ran a short transitional government and held new elections in 1963, which were won by Bela\u00fande by a more comfortable but still narrow five percent margin.\n\nThroughout Latin America in the 1960s, [[communist]] movements inspired by the [[Cuban Revolution]] sought to win power through [[guerrilla warfare]]. The [[Revolutionary Left Movement (Peru)]], or MIR, launched an [[insurrection]] that had been crushed by 1965, but Peru's internal strife would only accelerate until its climax in the 1990s.\n\nThe military has been prominent in Peruvian history. Coups have repeatedly interrupted civilian constitutional government. The most recent period of military rule (1968\u20131980) began when General [[Juan Velasco Alvarado]] overthrew elected President [[Fernando Bela\u00fande Terry]] of the [[Popular Action (Peru)|Popular Action Party]] (AP). As part of what has been called the \"first phase\" of the military government's nationalist program, Velasco undertook an extensive agrarian reform program and nationalized the fish meal industry, some petroleum companies, and several banks and mining firms.\n\nGeneral [[Francisco Morales Berm\u00fadez]] replaced Velasco in 1975, citing Velasco's economic mismanagement and deteriorating health. Morales Berm\u00fadez moved the revolution into a more conservative \"second phase\", tempering the radical measures of the first phase and beginning the task of restoring the country's economy. A constitutional assembly was created in 1979, which was led by [[V\u00edctor Ra\u00fal Haya de la Torre]]. Morales Berm\u00fadez presided over the return to civilian government in accordance with a new constitution drawn up in 1979.\n\n===Democratic restoration and elections (1979\u2013present day)===\n\n==== 1980s ====\nDuring the 1980s, cultivation of illicit coca was established in large areas on the eastern Andean slope. Rural insurgent movements, like the [[Shining Path]] (''Sendero Luminoso'', SL) and the [[T\u00fapac Amaru Revolutionary Movement]] (MRTA) increased and derived significant financial support from alliances with the narcotics traffickers, leading to the [[Internal conflict in Peru]].\n\nIn the May 1980 elections, President [[Fernando Bela\u00fande Terry]] was returned to office by a strong plurality. One of his first actions as President was the return of several newspapers to their respective owners. In this way, [[freedom of speech]] once again played an important part in Peruvian politics. Gradually, he also attempted to undo some of the most radical effects of the ''Agrarian Reform'' initiated by Velasco and reversed the independent stance that the military government of Velasco had with the United States.\n\nBela\u00fande's second term was also marked by the unconditional support for [[Argentina|Argentine]] forces during the [[Falklands War]] with the United Kingdom in 1982. Bela\u00fande declared that \"Peru was ready to support Argentina with all the resources it needed\". This included a number of fighter planes and possibly personnel from the [[Peruvian Air Force]], as well as ships, and medical teams. Belaunde's government proposed a peace settlement between the two countries, but it was rejected by both sides, as both claimed undiluted sovereignty of the territory. In response to [[Chile]]'s support of the UK, Bela\u00fande called for Latin American unity.\n\nThe nagging economic problems left over from the previous military government persisted, worsened by an occurrence of the \"[[El Ni\u00f1o]]\" weather phenomenon in 1982\u201383, which caused widespread flooding in some parts of the country, severe droughts in others, and decimated the schools of ocean fish that are one of the country's major resources. After a promising beginning, Bela\u00fande's popularity eroded under the stress of inflation, economic hardship, and terrorism.\n\nIn 1985, the [[American Popular Revolutionary Alliance]] (APRA) won the presidential election, bringing [[Alan Garc\u00eda]] to office. The transfer of the presidency from Bela\u00fande to Garc\u00eda on 28 July 1985 was Peru's first exchange of power from one democratically elected leader to another for the first time in 40 years.\n\nWith a parliamentary majority for the first time in APRA's history, Alan Garc\u00eda started his administration with hopes for a better future. However, economic mismanagement led to [[hyperinflation]] from 1988 to 1990. Garc\u00eda's term in office was marked by bouts of hyperinflation, which reached 7,649% in 1990 and had a cumulative total of 2,200,200% between July 1985 and July 1990, thereby profoundly destabilizing the Peruvian economy.\n\nOwing to such [[chronic inflation]], the Peruvian currency, the [[Peruvian sol (1863\u20131985)|sol]], was replaced by the ''[[Inti (currency)|Inti]]'' in mid-1985, which itself was replaced by the [[Peruvian nuevo sol|nuevo sol]] (\"new sun\") in July 1991, at which time the new ''sol'' had a cumulative value of one billion old soles. During his administration, the ''per capita'' annual income of Peruvians fell to $720 (below the level of 1960) and Peru's [[Gross Domestic Product]] dropped 20%. By the end of his term, national reserves were a negative $900 million.\n\nThe economic turbulence of the time exacerbated social tensions in Peru and partly contributed to the rise of the violent rebel movement [[Shining Path]]. The Garc\u00eda administration unsuccessfully sought a military solution to the growing terrorism, committing human rights violations which are still under investigation.\n\nIn June 1979, demonstrations for free education were severely repressed by the army: 18 people were killed according to official figures, but non-governmental estimates suggest several dozen deaths. This event led to a radicalization of political protests in the countryside and ultimately led to the outbreak of the Shining Path's armed and terrorist actions.<ref>Luis Rossell, Rupay: historias gr\u00e1ficas de la violencia en el Per\u00fa, 1980\u20131984, 2008</ref>\n\n====Fujimori's presidency and the Fujishock (1990\u20132000)====\nConcerned about the economy, the increasing terrorist threat from [[Shining Path|Sendero Luminoso]] and MRTA, and allegations of official corruption, voters chose a relatively unknown mathematician-turned-politician, [[Alberto Fujimori]], as president in 1990. The first round of the election was won by well-known writer [[Mario Vargas Llosa]], a conservative candidate who went on to receive the Nobel Prize in Literature in 2010, but Fujimori defeated him in the second round. Fujimori implemented drastic measures that caused inflation to drop from 7,650% in 1990 to 139% in 1991. The currency is devalued by 200%, prices are rising sharply (especially gasoline, whose price is multiplied by 30), hundreds of public companies are privatized and 300,000 jobs are being lost.  The majority of the population had not benefited from the years of strong growth, which will ultimately only widen the gap between rich and poor. The poverty rate remained at around 50%.<ref>The currency is devalued by 200%, prices are rising sharply (especially gasoline, whose price is multiplied by 30), hundreds of public companies are privatized and 300,000 jobs are being lost.  However, the social balance sheet remains much less positive. The majority of the population has not benefited from the years of strong growth, which will ultimately only widen the gap between rich and poor. The poverty rate remained at around 50%, a level comparable to Alan Garcia's completion rate5.</ref>\n\nAs other dictators did, Fujimori dissolved Congress in the ''[[auto-golpe]]'' of 5 April 1992, in order to have total control of the government of Peru. He then eliminated the constitution; called new congressional elections; and implemented substantial economic reform, including privatization of numerous state-owned companies, creation of an investment-friendly climate, and sound management of the economy.\n\nFujimori's administration was dogged by several insurgent groups, most notably Sendero Luminoso (Shining Path), which carried on a terrorist campaign in the countryside throughout the 1980s and 1990s. He cracked down on the insurgents and was successful in largely quelling them by the late 1990s, but the fight was marred by atrocities committed by both the Peruvian security forces and the insurgents: the [[Barrios Altos massacre]] and [[La Cantuta massacre]] by government paramilitary groups, and the bombings of [[Tarata bombing|Tarata]] and [[Frecuencia Latina bombing|Frecuencia Latina]] by [[Shining Path]]. Those examples subsequently came to be seen as symbols of the human rights violations committed during the last years of violence. With the capture of [[Abimael Guzm\u00e1n]] (known as ''President Gonzalo'' to the Shining Path) in September 1992, the Shining Path received a severe blow which practically destroyed the organization.\n\nIn December 1996, a group of insurgents belonging to the [[T\u00fapac Amaru Revolutionary Movement|MRTA]] [[Japanese embassy hostage crisis|took over the Japanese embassy in Lima]], taking 72 people hostage. Military commandos stormed the embassy compound in May 1997, which resulted in the death of all 15 hostage takers, one hostage, and 2 commandos. It later emerged, however, that Fujimori's security chief [[Vladimiro Montesinos]] may have ordered the killing of at least eight of the rebels after they surrendered.\n\nFujimori's constitutionally questionable decision to seek a third term and subsequent tainted victory in June 2000 brought political and economic turmoil. A bribery scandal that broke just weeks after he took office in July forced Fujimori to call new elections in which he would not run. The scandal involved Vladimiro Montesinos, who was shown in a video broadcast on TV bribing a politician to change sides. Montesinos subsequently emerged as the center a vast web of illegal activities, including embezzlement, graft, drug trafficking, as well as human rights violations committed during the war against Sendero Luminoso.\n\n==== Toledo, Garc\u00eda, Humala, Kuczynski presidencies (2001\u2013today) ====\n\nIn November 2000, Fujimori resigned from office and went to Japan in self-imposed exile, avoiding prosecution for human rights violations and corruption charges by the new Peruvian authorities. His main intelligence chief, [[Vladimiro Montesinos]], fled Peru shortly afterwards. Authorities in Venezuela arrested him in Caracas in June 2001 and turned him over to Peruvian authorities; he is now imprisoned and charged with acts of corruption and human rights violations committed during Fujimori's administration.\n\nA caretaker government presided over by [[Valent\u00edn Paniagua Corazao|Valent\u00edn Paniagua]] took on the responsibility of conducting new presidential and congressional elections. The [[2001 Peruvian general election|elections]] were held in April 2001; observers considered them to be free and fair. [[Alejandro Toledo]] (who led the opposition against Fujimori) defeated former President [[Alan Garc\u00eda]].\n\nThe newly elected government took office on 28 July 2001. The Toledo Administration managed to restore some degree of democracy to Peru following the authoritarianism and corruption that plagued both the Fujimori and Garc\u00eda governments. Innocents wrongfully tried by military courts during the war against terrorism (1980\u20132000) were allowed to receive new trials in civilian courts.\n\nOn 28 August 2003, the [[Truth and Reconciliation Commission (Peru)|Truth and Reconciliation Commission]] (CVR), which had been charged with studying the roots of the violence of the 1980\u20132000 period, presented its formal report to the President.\n\nPresident Toledo was forced to make a number of cabinet changes, mostly in response to personal scandals. Toledo's governing coalition had a minority of seats in Congress and had to negotiate on an ''ad hoc'' basis with other parties to form majorities on legislative proposals. Toledo's popularity in the polls suffered throughout the last years of his regime, due in part to family scandals and in part to dissatisfaction among workers with their share of benefits from Peru's macroeconomic success. After strikes by teachers and agricultural producers led to nationwide road blockages in May 2003, Toledo declared a state of emergency that suspended some civil liberties and gave the military power to enforce order in 12 regions. The state of emergency was later reduced to only the few areas where the Shining Path was operating.\n\nOn 28 July 2006, former president Alan Garc\u00eda became the President of Peru. He won the [[2006 Peruvian election|2006 elections]] after winning in a runoff against [[Ollanta Humala]]. In May 2008, President Garc\u00eda was a signatory to The [[UNASUR Constitutive Treaty]] of the [[Union of South American Nations]]. Peru has ratified the treaty.\n\nOn 5 June 2011, Ollanta Humala was elected President in a run-off against [[Keiko Fujimori]], the daughter of Alberto Fujimori and former [[First Lady]] of Peru, in the [[2011 Peruvian general election|2011 elections]], making him the first leftist president of Peru since [[Juan Velasco Alvarado]]. In December 2011, a state of emergency was declared following popular opposition to some major mining project and environmental concerns.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.andina.com.pe/Ingles/Noticia.aspx?id=AhG0n1njO4I=|title=Peru government declares state of emergency in four Cajamarca provinces|access-date=2011-12-05|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120616191103/http://www.andina.com.pe/Ingles/Noticia.aspx?id=AhG0n1njO4I=|archive-date=2012-06-16|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n[[Pedro Pablo Kuczynski]] was elected president in the [[2016 Peruvian general election|general election]] in July 2016.

On 23 March 2018, Kucyznski was forced to resign from the [[President of Peru|presidency]], and has not been heard from since. His successor would be his first [[vice president]], engineer [[Mart\u00edn Vizcarra]], who would succeed him as President until the end of the term in 2021.

Over the next three thousand years, inhabitants switched from nomadic lifestyles to cultivating land, as evidenced from sites such as [[Jiskairumoko]], [[Kotosh|Kotosh,]] and [[Huaca Prieta]]. Cultivation of plants such as [[Maize|corn]] and [[Gossypium|cotton]] (''Gossypium barbadense'') began, as well as the domestication of animals such as the wild ancestors of the [[llama]], the [[alpaca]] and the [[guinea pig]], as seen in the 6000 BC dated [[Camelid]] relief paintings in the Mollepunko caves in [[Callalli District|Callalli]]. Inhabitants practiced [[Spinning (textiles)|spinning]] and [[knitting]] of cotton and wool, [[Basket weaving|basketry]], and [[pottery]].\n\nAs these inhabitants became sedentary, farming allowed them to build settlements. As a result, new societies emerged along the coast and in the Andean mountains. The first known city in the Americas was [[Caral]], located in the [[Supe District|Supe Valley]] 200&nbsp;km north of Lima. It was built in approximately 2500 BC.<ref name=\"Mann\"/>\n\nThe remnants of this civilization, also known as [[Norte Chico civilization|Norte Chico]], consists of approximately 30 pyramidal structures built up in receding terraces ending in a flat roof; some of them measuring up to 20 meters in height.

The [[Paracas culture]] emerged on the southern coast around 300 BC. They are known for their use of [[vicu\u00f1a]] fibers instead of just [[cotton]] to produce fine [[textile]]s\u2014innovations that did not reach the northern coast of Peru until centuries later. Coastal cultures such as the [[Moche (culture)|Moche]] and [[Nazca culture|Nazca]] flourished from about 100 BC to about AD 700: the Moche produced impressive metalwork, as well as some of the finest [[pottery]] seen in the ancient world, while the Nazca are known for their textiles and the enigmatic [[Nazca lines]].\n\nThese coastal cultures eventually began to decline as a result of recurring ''[[el Ni\u00f1o]]'' floods and droughts. In consequence, the [[Huari culture|Huari]] and [[Tiwanaku]], who dwelt inland in the [[Andes]], became the predominant cultures of the region encompassing much of modern-day Peru and [[Bolivia]]. They were succeeded by powerful [[city-state]]s such as [[Chancay]], [[Sipan]], and [[Cajamarca]], and two empires: [[Chimor]] and [[Chachapoyas culture|Chachapoyas]]. These cultures developed relatively advanced techniques of [[Tillage|cultivation]], gold and silver craft, [[pottery]], [[metallurgy]], and [[knitting]]. Around 700 BC, they appear to have developed systems of social organization that were the precursors of the [[Inca Empire|Inca]] civilization.\n\nIn the highlands, both the [[Tiwanaku|Tiahuanaco]] culture, near [[Lake Titicaca]] in both Peru and [[Bolivia]], and the [[Wari culture]], near the present-day city of [[Ayacucho]], developed large urban settlements and wide-ranging state systems between 500 and 1000 AD.<ref>Peru [http://countrystudies.us/peru/2.htm Pre-Inca Cultures].

It dominated a territory that included (from north to south): the southwest part of [[Ecuador]], part of [[Colombia]], the main territory of [[Peru]], the northern part of [[Chile]], and the northwest part of [[Argentina]]; and from east to west, from the southwest part of [[Bolivia]] to the [[Amazon Rainforest|Amazonian forests]].\n\nThe empire originated from a tribe based in [[Cusco]], which became the capital. Pachacutec wasn't the first Inca, but he was the first ruler to considerably expand the boundaries of the [[Cusco Region|Cusco]] state. He could probably be compared to [[Alexander the Great]] (from Macedon), [[Julius Caesar]] (of the Roman Empire), [[Attila]] (from the Huns tribes) and [[Genghis Khan]] (from the Mongol Empire).{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}} His offspring later ruled an empire by both violent invasions and peaceful conquests, that is, intermarriages among the rulers of small kingdoms and the current Inca ruler.\n\nIn [[Cusco (Department of Peru)|Cuzco]], the royal city was created to resemble a [[cougar]]; the head, the main royal structure, formed what is now known as [[Sacsayhuam\u00e1n]]. The empire's administrative, political, and military center was located in Cusco. The empire was divided into four quarters: [[Chinchaysuyu]], [[Antisuyu]], [[Kuntisuyu]] and [[Qullasuyu]].\n\nThe official language was [[Quechua language|Quechua]]. It was the language of a neighbouring tribe of the original tribe of the empire. Conquered populations\u2014tribes, kingdoms, states, and cities\u2014were allowed to practice their own religions and lifestyles, but had to recognize Inca cultural practices as superior to their own. [[Inti]], the sun god, was to be worshipped as one of the most important gods of the empire. His representation on earth was the Inca (\"Emperor\").{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\nThe [[Tawantinsuyu]] was organized in dominions with a stratified society, in which the ruler was the Inca. It was also supported by an economy based on the collective property of the land. The empire, being quite large, also had an impressive transportation system of roads to all points of the empire called the [[Inca road system|Inca Trail]], and [[chasquis]], message carriers who relayed information from anywhere in the empire to Cusco.\n\n[[Machu Picchu]] (Quechua for \"old peak\"; sometimes called the \"Lost City of the Incas\") is a well-preserved pre-Columbian Inca ruin located on a high mountain ridge above the [[Urubamba Valley]], about 70&nbsp;km (44&nbsp;mi) northwest of Cusco. Elevation measurements vary depending on whether the data refers to the ruin or the extremity of the mountain; Machu Picchu tourist information reports the elevation as 2,350&nbsp;m (7,711&nbsp;ft)[1]. Forgotten for centuries by the outside world (although not by locals), it was brought back to international attention by Yale archaeologist [[Hiram Bingham III]]. Bingham, often cited as the inspiration for Indiana Jones, \"scientifically rediscovered\" the site in 1911 and brought international attention to the site with his best-selling book ''Lost City of the Incas''. Peru is pursuing legal efforts to retrieve thousands of artifacts that Bingham removed from the site and sold to the current owners at Yale University.<ref>{{cite news\n|url = https://www.nytimes.com/2007/06/24/magazine/24MachuPicchu-t.html?pagewanted=1&ei=5088&en=5ef3ca602130ba03&ex=1340337600&partner=rssnyt&emc=rss\n|title = The Possessed\n|accessdate = 2007-07-14\n|last = Lubow\n|first = Arthur\n|date = June 24, 2007\n|newspaper = New York Times\n|page = 10\n}}</ref>\n\nAlthough Machu Picchu is by far the most well known internationally, Peru boasts of many other sites where the modern visitor can see extensive and well-preserved ruins, remnants of the Inca-period and even older constructions. Much of the Inca architecture and stonework found at these sites continues to confound archaeologists. For example, at [[Sacsayhuam\u00e1n|Sacsaywaman]] in Cusco, the zig-zag-shaped walls are composed of massive boulders fitted very precisely to one another's irregular, angular shapes. No mortar holds them together, but nonetheless they have remained absolutely solid through the centuries, surviving earthquakes that flattened many of the colonial constructions of Cusco. Damage to the walls visible today was mainly inflicted during battles between the Spanish and the Inca, as well as later, in the colonial era. As Cusco grew, the walls of Sacsaywaman were partially dismantled, the site becoming a convenient source of construction materials for the city's newer inhabitants. It is still not known how these stones were shaped and smoothed, lifted on top of one another (they really are ''very'' massive), or fitted together by the Incas; we also do not know how they transported the stones to the site in the first place. The stone used is not native to the area and most likely came from mountains many kilometers away.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\n==European colonization of Peru (1532\u20131572)==\n{| class=\"toccolours\" style=\"float:right; margin-left:1em; margin-right:0; font-size:85%; background:#e7edf5; width:28em; max-width:35%;\" cellspacing=\"5\"\n| style=\"text-align: left;\" | '''The etymology of ''Peru'':''' The word ''Peru'' may be derived from ''Bir\u00fa'', the name of a local ruler who lived near the [[Bay of San Miguel]], [[Panama]], in the early 16th century.<ref>Porras Barrenechea (1968) p. 83</ref> When his possessions were visited by Spanish explorers in 1522, they were the southernmost part of the New World yet known to Europeans.<ref>Porras Barrenechea (1968) p. 84</ref> Thus, when [[Francisco Pizarro]] explored the regions farther south, they came to be designated Bir\u00fa or Peru.<ref>Porras Barrenechea (1968) p. 86.</ref>\n\nAn alternative history is provided by the contemporary writer Inca Garcilasco de la Vega, son of an Inca princess and a conquistador.

''The Conquest of the Inca''. New York: Harcourt, Inc., 1970, 28\u201329.</ref> Taking advantage of this, [[Pizarro]] carried out a ''[[coup d'\u00e9tat]]''. On 16 November 1532, while the Atahualpa's victorious army was in an unarmed celebration in [[Cajamarca (city)|Cajamarca]], the Spanish lured Atahualpa into a trap during the [[Battle of Cajamarca]]. The well-armed 168 Spaniards killed thousands of barely armed Inca soldiers and captured the newly minted Inca ruler, causing a great consternation among the natives and conditioning the future course of the fight. When Hu\u00e1scar was killed, the Spanish tried and convicted Atahualpa of the murder, executing him by strangulation.\n\nFor a period, Pizarro maintained the ostensible authority of the [[Inca]], recognizing [[T\u00fapac Huallpa]] as the [[Sapa Inca]] after Atahualpa's death. But the conqueror's abuses made this facade too obvious. Spanish domination consolidated itself as successive indigenous rebellions were bloodily repressed. By 23 March 1534, Pizarro and the Spanish had re-founded the Inca city of Cuzco as a new Spanish colonial settlement.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\nEstablishing a stable colonial government was delayed for some time by native revolts and bands of the ''[[Conquistadores]]'' (led by Pizarro and [[Diego de Almagro]]) fighting among themselves. A long civil war developed, from which Pizarro emerged victorious at the [[Battle of Las Salinas]]. In 1541, Pizarro was assassinated by a faction led by [[Diego de Almagro II]] (''El Mozo''), and the stability of the original colonial regime was shaken up in the ensuing [[civil war]].\n\n[[Image:Pizarro in Lima.JPG|thumb|left|Pizarro and his followers in Lima in 1535]]\nDespite this, the Spaniards did not neglect the colonizing process. Its most significant milestone was the foundation of [[Lima]] in January 1535, from which the political and administrative institutions were organized. The new rulers instituted an [[encomienda|''encomienda'' system]], by which the Spanish extracted tribute from the local population, part of which was forwarded to [[Seville]] in return for converting the natives to Christianity. Title to the land itself remained with the [[king of Spain]]. As governor of Peru, Pizarro used the ''encomienda'' system to grant virtually unlimited authority over groups of native Peruvians to his soldier companions, thus forming the colonial land-tenure structure. The indigenous inhabitants of Peru were now expected to raise [[Old World]] [[cattle]], [[poultry]], and crops for their landlords. Resistance was punished severely, giving rise to the \"[[Black legend (Spain)|Black Legend]]\".\n\nThe necessity of consolidating Spanish royal authority over these territories led to the creation of a [[Real Audiencia]] (Royal Audience). The following year, in 1542, the [[Viceroyalty of Peru]] (''Virreinato del Per\u00fa'') was established, with authority over most of Spanish-ruled South America. ([[Colombia]], [[Ecuador]], [[Panam\u00e1]] and [[Venezuela]] were split off as the [[Viceroyalty of New Granada]] (''Virreinato de Nueva Granada'') in 1717; and [[Argentina]], [[Bolivia]], [[Paraguay]], and [[Uruguay]] were set up as the [[Viceroyalty of the R\u00edo de la Plata]] in 1776).{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\nAfter Pizarro's death, there were numerous internal problems, and Spain finally sent [[Blasco N\u00fa\u00f1ez Vela]] to be Peru's first viceroy in 1544. He was later killed by Pizarro's brother, [[Gonzalo Pizarro]], but a new viceroy, [[Pedro de la Gasca]], eventually managed to restore order. He captured and executed Gonzalo Pizarro.\n\nA census taken by the last [[Quipu|Quipucamayoc]] indicated that there were 12 million inhabitants of Inca Peru; 45 years later, under viceroy Toledo, the census figures amounted to only 1,100,000 Inca. Historian David N. Cook estimates that their population decreased from an estimated 9 million in the 1520's to around 600,000 in 1620 mainly because of [[infectious disease]]s.<ref>Noble David Cook, ''Demographic collapse: Indian Peru, 1520\u20131620'', p. 114.</ref> While the attrition was not an organized attempt at [[genocide]], the results were similar.

A few Inca cities like Cuzco retained native masonry for the foundations of their walls. Other Inca sites, like [[Huanuco Viejo]], were abandoned for cities at lower altitudes more hospitable to the Spanish.\n\n==Viceroyalty of Peru (1542\u20131824)==\n{{main|Viceroyalty of Peru}}\n[[File:Colonial Peru textile.jpg|thumb|Colonial [[tapestry]], late 17th or early 18th century. It was woven by indigenous weavers for a Spanish client, incorporating then-fashionable Chinese imagery.]]\n\nIn 1542, the Spanish Crown created the [[Viceroyalty of Peru]], which was reorganized after the arrival of Viceroy [[Francisco de Toledo]] in 1572. He put an end to the indigenous [[Neo-Inca State]] in [[Vilcabamba, Peru|Vilcabamba]] and executed [[T\u00fapac Amaru|Tupac Amaru I]]. He also sought economic development through commercial monopoly and mineral extraction, mainly from the silver mines of [[Potos\u00ed]]. He reused the Inca ''[[Mita (Inca)|mita]]'', a forced labor program, to mobilize native communities for mining work. This organization transformed Peru into the principal source of Spanish wealth and power in South America.\n\nThe town of [[Lima]], founded by Pizarro on 18 January 1535 as the \"Ciudad de Reyes\" (City of Kings), became the seat of the new viceroyalty. It grew into a powerful city, with jurisdiction over most of Spanish South America. Precious metals passed through Lima on their way to the [[Isthmus of Panama]] and from there to [[Seville, Spain]]. By the 18th century, Lima had become a distinguished and aristocratic colonial capital, seat of a university and the chief Spanish stronghold in the Americas.\n\nNevertheless, throughout the eighteenth century, further away from Lima in the provinces, the Spanish did not have complete control. The Spanish could not govern the provinces without the help of local elite. This local elite, who governed under the title of Curaca, took pride in their Incan history. Additionally, throughout the eighteenth century, indigenous people rebelled against the Spanish. Two of the most important rebellions were that of [[Juan Santos Atahualpa]] in 1742 in the Andean jungle provinces of [[Tarma]] and [[Jauja]], and Rebellion of [[T\u00fapac Amaru II]] in 1780 around the highlands near Cuzco.\n\nAt the time, an economic crisis was developing due to creation of the Viceroyalties of [[Viceroyalty of New Granada|New Granada]] and [[Viceroyalty of the R\u00edo de la Plata|Rio de la Plata]] (at the expense of its territory), the duty exemptions that moved the commercial center from [[Lima]] to [[Caracas]] and [[Buenos Aires]], and the decrease of the mining and textile production. This crisis proved favorable for the indigenous rebellion of T\u00fapac Amaru II and determined the progressive decay of the Viceroyalty of Peru.\n\nIn 1808, Napoleon invaded the [[Iberian Peninsula]] and took the king, [[Ferdinand VII of Spain|Ferdinand VII]], hostage. Later in 1812, the [[Cortes of C\u00e1diz|Cad\u00edz Cortes]], the national legislative assembly of Spain, promulgated a liberal [[Spanish Constitution of 1812|Constitution of Cadiz]]. These events inspired emancipating ideas between the [[Criollo people|Spanish Criollo people]] throughout the Spanish America. In Peru, the Creole rebellion of [[Hu\u00e1nuco (Department of Peru)|Hu\u00e1nuco]] arose in 1812 and the rebellion of [[Cusco (Department of Peru)|Cuzco]] arose between 1814 and 1816. Despite these rebellions, the [[Criollo people|Criollo]] oligarchy in Peru remained mostly Spanish loyalist, which accounts for the fact that the [[Viceroyalty of Peru]] became the last redoubt of the Spanish dominion in South America.\n\n==Wars of independence (1811\u20131824)==\n[[Image:La Independencia del Per\u00fa.jpg|thumb|right|Jos\u00e9 de San Mart\u00edn's proclamation of the independence of Peru on July 28, 1821 in [[Lima]], [[Peru]].

San Mart\u00edn opted for a constitutional monarchy, whilst Bolivar (Head of the Northern Expedition) opted for a republican. Nonetheless, they both followed the notion that it was to be independent of Spain. Following the interview, San Martin abandoned Peru on 22 September 1822 and left the whole command of the independence movement to Simon Bolivar. \n[[File:Batalla de Jun\u00edn.jpg|thumb|250px|Battle of Jun\u00edn, 6 August 1824]]\n\nThe Peruvian congress named Bolivar dictator of Peru on 10 February 1824, which allowed him to reorganize the political and military administration completely. Assisted by general [[Antonio Jos\u00e9 de Sucre]], Bol\u00edvar decisively defeated the Spanish [[cavalry]] at the [[Battle of Jun\u00edn]] on 6 August 1824. Sucre destroyed the still numerically superior remnants of the Spanish forces at [[Battle of Ayacucho|Ayacucho]] on 9 December 1824. The war would not end until the last royalist holdouts surrendered the [[Real Felipe Fortress]] in 1826. \n\nThe victory brought about political independence, but there remained indigenous and [[mestizo]] supporters of the monarchy and in [[Huanta Province]], they rebelled in 1825\u201328, which is known as ''the war of the punas'' or the Huanta Rebellion.<ref>Ceclia M\u00e9ndez, ''The Plebeian Republic: The Huanta Rebellion and the Making of the Peruvian State, 1820\u20131850''.

An attempt to unite Peru and [[Bolivia]] was made during the period 1836\u20131839 by Bolivian President [[Andres de Santa Cruz]] when the [[Peru-Bolivian Confederation]] came into existence. Severe internal opposition led to its demise in the [[War of the Confederation]] which dovetailed into a Peruvian attempt to annex Bolivia by [[Agust\u00edn Gamarra]] that ultimately failed and turned into a protracted war.<ref>{{cite book |last= Werlich |first= David P. |title= Peru \u2014 a short history |publisher= [[Southern Illinois University Press]] |year= 1978 |pages= [https://archive.org/details/perushorthistory00werl/page/70 70\u201372] |isbn= 0-8093-0830-4 |url-access= registration |url= https://archive.org/details/perushorthistory00werl/page/70 }}</ref>\n\nPeru embarked on a railroad-building program. The American entrepreneur [[Henry Meiggs]] built a standard gauge line from [[Callao]] across the Andes to the interior, [[Huancayo]]; he built the line and controlled its politics for a while; in the end, he bankrupted himself and the country. President [[Tom\u00e1s Guardia Guti\u00e9rrez|Tom\u00e1s Guardia]] contracted with Meiggs in 1871 to build a railroad to the Atlantic. Financial problems forced the government to take over in 1874. The labor conditions were complex, with conflicts arising from different levels of skill and organization among the North Americans, Europeans, Blacks, and the Chinese. Conditions were very brutal for the Chinese, and led to strikes and violent suppression.<ref>Watt Stewart, ''Henry Meiggs: Yankee Pizarro'' (1946)</ref>\n\n[[File:Batalla en guerra del Pacifico (1879-1883).png|thumb|1882\u201383 Sierra Campaign]]\nIn 1879, Peru entered the [[War of the Pacific]] which lasted until 1884. Bolivia invoked its alliance with Peru against Chile. The [[Peruvian Government]] tried to mediate the dispute by sending a diplomatic team to negotiate with the Chilean government, but the committee concluded that war was inevitable. On 14 March 1879, Bolivia declared war and Chile, in response, declared war on Bolivia and Peru on 5 April 1879 with Peru following with its own declaration of war the next day. Almost five years of war ended with the loss of the department of [[Tarapac\u00e1 Region|Tarapac\u00e1]] and the provinces of [[Tacna]] and [[Arica]], in the Atacama region.\n\nOriginally, Chile committed to a referendum for the cities of Arica and Tacna to be held years later, in order to determine their national affiliation. However, Chile refused to apply the treaty, and both countries could not determine the statutory framework. In an arbitrage that both countries admitted, the United States decided that the plebiscite was impossible to take, therefore, direct negotiations between the parties led to a treaty ([[Treaty of Lima]], 1929), in which [[Arica]] was ceded to Chile and [[Tacna]] remained in Peru. Tacna was returned to Peru on 29 August 1929. The territorial loss and the extensive looting of Peruvian cities by Chilean troops left scars on the country's relations with Chile that have not yet fully healed.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\nFollowing the [[Ecuadorian-Peruvian War]] of 1941, the [[Rio Protocol]] sought to formalize the boundary between those two countries. [[History of the Ecuadorian-Peruvian territorial dispute|Ongoing boundary disagreements]] led to a brief war in early 1981 and the [[Cenepa War]] in early 1995, but in 1998, the governments of both countries signed an historic peace treaty that clearly demarcated the international boundary between them. In late 1999, the governments of Peru and Chile implemented the last outstanding article of their 1929 border agreement.\n\n===Aristocratic Republic (1884\u20131930)===\n[[File:Borders Chile 1879 and 2006 SP.png|thumb|200px|Chile's territorial gains after the War of the Pacific]]\nAfter the [[War of the Pacific]], an extraordinary effort of rebuilding began. The government started to initiate a number of social and economic reforms in order to recover from the damage of the war. Political stability was achieved only in the early 1900's.\n\nIn 1894, [[Nicol\u00e1s de Pi\u00e9rola]], after allying his party with the [[Civilista Party|Civil Party]] of Peru to organize guerrilla fighters to occupy Lima, ousted [[Andr\u00e9s Avelino C\u00e1ceres]] and once again became president of Peru in 1895. After a brief period in which the military once again controlled the country, civilian rule was permanently established with Pierola's election in 1895. His second term was successfully completed in 1899 and was marked by his reconstruction of a devastated Peru by initiating fiscal, military, religious, and civil reforms. Until the 1920's, this period was called the \"Aristocratic Republic\", since most of the presidents that ruled the country were from the social elite.\n\nDuring [[Augusto B. Legu\u00eda]]'s periods in government (1908\u20131912 and 1919\u20131930), the latter known as the \"Oncenio\" (the \"Eleventh\"), the entrance of American capital became general and the [[bourgeoisie]] was favored. This policy, along with increased dependence on foreign investment, focused opposition from the most progressive sectors of Peruvian society against the landowner oligarchy.\n\nThere was a final peace treaty in 1929, signed between Peru and Chile and called the [[Treaty of Lima]] by which Tacna returned to Peru and Peru yielded permanently the formerly rich provinces of Arica and Tarapac\u00e1, but kept certain rights to the port activities in Arica and restrictions on what Chile can do on those territories.\n\nIn 1924, from [[Mexico]], university reform leaders in Peru who had been forced into exile by the government founded the [[American People's Revolutionary Alliance|American People's Revolutionary Alliance (ARPA)]], which had a major influence on the country's political life. APRA is largely a political expression of the university reform and workers' struggles of the years 1918\u20131920. The movement draws its influences from the [[Mexican revolution]] and its [[1917 Constitution]], particularly on issues of [[agrarianism]] and [[indigenism]], and to a lesser extent from the Russian revolution. Close to [[Marxism]] (its leader, [[Haya de la Torre]], declares that \"APRA is the Marxist interpretation of the American reality\"), it nevertheless moves away from it on the question of class struggle and on the importance given to the struggle for the political unity of Latin America.<ref>Latin America in the 20th century: 1889\u20131929, 1991, p. 314-319</ref>\n\nIn 1928, the [[Peruvian Socialist Party]] was founded, notably under the leadership of [[Jos\u00e9 Carlos Mari\u00e1tegui]], himself a former member of APRA. Shortly afterwards, in 1929, the party created the [[General Confederation of Workers (Mexico)|General Confederation of Workers]].\n\n=== Alternation between democracy and militarism (1930\u20131979) ===\nAfter the worldwide crisis of 1929, numerous brief governments followed one another. The APRA party had the opportunity to cause system reforms by means of political actions, but it was not successful. This was a nationalistic movement, populist and anti-imperialist, headed by [[V\u00edctor Ra\u00fal Haya de la Torre|Victor Raul Haya de la Torre]] in 1924. The Socialist Party of Peru, later the [[Peruvian Communist Party]], was created four years later and it was led by [[Jos\u00e9 Carlos Mari\u00e1tegui|Jose C. Mariategui]].\n\nRepression was brutal in the early 1930's and tens of thousands of APRA followers (''Apristas'') were executed or imprisoned. This period was also characterized by a sudden population growth and an increase in urbanization. According to [[Alberto Flores Galindo]], \"By the 1940 census, the last that utilized racial categories, [[mestizo]]s were grouped with whites, and the two constituted more than 53 percent of the population. Mestizos likely outnumbered the indigenous peoples and were the largest population group.\"<ref>{{Cite book\n| last = Galindo\n| first = Alberto Flores \n| title = In Search of an Inca: Identity and Utopia in the Andes\n| publisher = Cambridge University Press\n| year = 2010\n| page = 247\n| isbn = 0-521-59861-3\n}}\n</ref> On 12 February 1944, Peru was [[Allies of World War II#After the Declaration by United Nations|one of the South American nations]] \u2013 following [[Brazilian Expeditionary Force#Overview|Brazil]] on 22 August 1942, [[Bolivia]] on 7 April 1943 and [[Colombia]] on 26 July 1943 to align with the [[Allies of World War II|Allied forces]] against the Axis.\n\nFollowing the Allied victory in [[World War II]] by 2 September 1945, [[V\u00edctor Ra\u00fal Haya de la Torre]] (founder of the APRA), together with [[Jos\u00e9 Carlos Mari\u00e1tegui]] (leader of the [[Peruvian Communist Party]]), were two major forces in Peruvian politics. Ideologically opposed, they both managed to create the first political parties that tackled the social and economic problems of the country. Although Mari\u00e1tegui died at a young age, Haya de la Torre was twice elected president, but prevented by the military from taking office. During World War II, the country rounded up around 2,000 of its Japanese immigrant population and shipped them to the United States as part of the [[Japanese-American internment]] program.<ref>[[Agence France-Presse]]/[[Jiji Press]], \"Peru sorry for World War II internments\", ''[[Japan Times]]'', 16 June 2011, p. 2.</ref>\n\nPresident [[Jos\u00e9 Bustamante y Rivero|Bustamante y Rivero]] hoped to create a more democratic government by limiting the power of the military and the oligarchy. Elected with the cooperation of the APRA, conflict soon arose between the President and Haya de la Torre. Without the support of the APRA party, Bustamante y Rivero found his presidency severely limited. The President disbanded his ''Aprista'' cabinet and replaced it with a mostly military one. In 1948, Minister [[Manuel A. Odria]] and other [[right-wing]] elements of the Cabinet urged Bustamante y Rivero to ban the APRA, but when the President refused, Odr\u00eda resigned his post.\n\nIn a military coup on 29 October, Gen. [[Manuel A. Odria]] became the new President. Odr\u00eda's presidency was known as the ''Ochenio''. He came down hard on APRA, momentarily pleasing the oligarchy and all others on the right, but followed a [[Populism|populist]] course that won him great favor with the poor and lower classes. A thriving economy allowed him to indulge in expensive but crowd-pleasing social policies. At the same time, however, [[civil rights]] were severely restricted and [[political corruption|corruption]] was rampant throughout his r\u00e9gime.\n\nIt was feared that his dictatorship would run indefinitely, so it came as a surprise when Odr\u00eda allowed new elections. During this time, [[Fernando Bela\u00fande Terry]] started his political career, and led the slate submitted by the National Front of Democratic Youth. After the National Election Board refused to accept his candidacy, he led a massive protest, and the striking image of Bela\u00fande walking with the flag was featured by news magazine ''[[Caretas]]'' the following day, in an article entitled \"As\u00ed Nacen Los Lideres\" (\"Thus Are Leaders Born\"). Bela\u00fande's 1956 candidacy was ultimately unsuccessful, as the dictatorship-favored right-wing candidacy of [[Manuel Prado Ugarteche]] took first place.\n\nBela\u00fande ran for president once again in the national elections of 1962; this time with his own party, [[Popular Action (Spain)|Acci\u00f3n Popular]] (Popular Action). The results were very tight; he ended in second place, following V\u00edctor Ra\u00fal Haya de la Torre (APRA), by less than 14,000 votes. Since none of the candidates managed to get the constitutionally established minimum of one third of the vote required to win outright, selection of the President should have fallen to Congress; the long-held antagonistic relationship between the military and APRA prompted Haya de la Torre to make a deal with former dictator Odria, who had come in third, which would have resulted in Odria taking the Presidency in a coalition government.\n\nHowever, widespread allegations of fraud prompted the Peruvian military to depose Prado and install a military ''junta'', led by [[Ricardo P\u00e9rez Godoy|Ricardo Perez Godoy]]. Godoy ran a short transitional government and held new elections in 1963, which were won by Bela\u00fande by a more comfortable but still narrow five percent margin.\n\nThroughout Latin America in the 1960's, [[communist]] movements inspired by the [[Cuban Revolution]] sought to win power through [[guerrilla warfare]]. The [[Revolutionary Left Movement (Peru)]], or MIR, launched an [[insurrection]] that had been crushed by 1965, but Peru's internal strife would only accelerate until its climax in the 1990's.\n\nThe military has been prominent in Peruvian history. Coups have repeatedly interrupted civilian constitutional government. The most recent period of military rule (1968\u20131980) began when General [[Juan Velasco Alvarado]] overthrew elected President [[Fernando Bela\u00fande Terry]] of the [[Popular Action (Peru)|Popular Action Party]] (AP). As part of what has been called the \"first phase\" of the military government's nationalist program, Velasco undertook an extensive agrarian reform program and nationalized the fish meal industry, some petroleum companies, and several banks and mining firms.\n\nGeneral [[Francisco Morales Berm\u00fadez]] replaced Velasco in 1975, citing Velasco's economic mismanagement and deteriorating health. Morales Berm\u00fadez moved the revolution into a more conservative \"second phase\", tempering the radical measures of the first phase and beginning the task of restoring the country's economy. A constitutional assembly was created in 1979, which was led by [[V\u00edctor Ra\u00fal Haya de la Torre]]. Morales Berm\u00fadez presided over the return to civilian government in accordance with a new constitution drawn up in 1979.\n\n===Democratic restoration and elections (1979\u2013present day)===\n\n==== 1980s ====\nDuring the 1980's, cultivation of illicit coca was established in large areas on the eastern Andean slope. Rural insurgent movements, like the [[Shining Path]] (''Sendero Luminoso'', SL) and the [[T\u00fapac Amaru Revolutionary Movement]] (MRTA) increased and derived significant financial support from alliances with the narcotics traffickers, leading to the [[Internal conflict in Peru]].\n\nIn the May 1980 elections, President [[Fernando Bela\u00fande Terry]] was returned to office by a strong plurality. One of his first actions as President was the return of several newspapers to their respective owners. In this way, [[freedom of speech]] once again played an important part in Peruvian politics. Gradually, he also attempted to undo some of the most radical effects of the ''Agrarian Reform'' initiated by Velasco and reversed the independent stance that the military government of Velasco had with the United States.\n\nBela\u00fande's second term was also marked by the unconditional support for [[Argentina|Argentine]] forces during the [[Falklands War]] with the United Kingdom in 1982. Bela\u00fande declared that \"Peru was ready to support Argentina with all the resources it needed\". This included a number of fighter planes and possibly personnel from the [[Peruvian Air Force]], as well as ships, and medical teams. Belaunde's government proposed a peace settlement between the two countries, but it was rejected by both sides, as both claimed undiluted sovereignty of the territory. In response to [[Chile]]'s support of the UK, Bela\u00fande called for Latin American unity.\n\nThe nagging economic problems left over from the previous military government persisted, worsened by an occurrence of the \"[[El Ni\u00f1o]]\" weather phenomenon in 1982\u201383, which caused widespread flooding in some parts of the country, severe droughts in others, and decimated the schools of ocean fish that are one of the country's major resources. After a promising beginning, Bela\u00fande's popularity eroded under the stress of inflation, economic hardship, and terrorism.\n\nIn 1985, the [[American Popular Revolutionary Alliance]] (APRA) won the presidential election, bringing [[Alan Garc\u00eda]] to office. The transfer of the presidency from Bela\u00fande to Garc\u00eda on 28 July 1985 was Peru's first exchange of power from one democratically elected leader to another for the first time in 40 years.\n\nWith a parliamentary majority for the first time in APRA's history, Alan Garc\u00eda started his administration with hopes for a better future. However, economic mismanagement led to [[hyperinflation]] from 1988 to 1990. Garc\u00eda's term in office was marked by bouts of hyperinflation, which reached 7,649% in 1990 and had a cumulative total of 2,200,200% between July 1985 and July 1990, thereby profoundly destabilizing the Peruvian economy.\n\nOwing to such [[chronic inflation]], the Peruvian currency, the [[Peruvian sol (1863\u20131985)|sol]], was replaced by the ''[[Inti (currency)|Inti]]'' in mid-1985, which itself was replaced by the [[Peruvian nuevo sol|nuevo sol]] (\"new sun\") in July 1991, at which time the new ''sol'' had a cumulative value of one billion old soles. During his administration, the ''per capita'' annual income of Peruvians fell to $720 (below the level of 1960) and Peru's [[Gross Domestic Product]] dropped 20%. By the end of his term, national reserves were a negative $900 million.\n\nThe economic turbulence of the time exacerbated social tensions in Peru and partly contributed to the rise of the violent rebel movement [[Shining Path]]. The Garc\u00eda administration unsuccessfully sought a military solution to the growing terrorism, committing human rights violations which are still under investigation.\n\nIn June 1979, demonstrations for free education were severely repressed by the army: 18 people were killed according to official figures, but non-governmental estimates suggest several dozen deaths. This event led to a radicalization of political protests in the countryside and ultimately led to the outbreak of the Shining Path's armed and terrorist actions.<ref>Luis Rossell, Rupay: historias gr\u00e1ficas de la violencia en el Per\u00fa, 1980\u20131984, 2008</ref>\n\n====Fujimori's presidency and the Fujishock (1990\u20132000)====\nConcerned about the economy, the increasing terrorist threat from [[Shining Path|Sendero Luminoso]] and MRTA, and allegations of official corruption, voters chose a relatively unknown mathematician-turned-politician, [[Alberto Fujimori]], as president in 1990. The first round of the election was won by well-known writer [[Mario Vargas Llosa]], a conservative candidate who went on to receive the Nobel Prize in Literature in 2010, but Fujimori defeated him in the second round. Fujimori implemented drastic measures that caused inflation to drop from 7,650% in 1990 to 139% in 1991. The currency is devalued by 200%, prices are rising sharply (especially gasoline, whose price is multiplied by 30), hundreds of public companies are privatized and 300,000 jobs are being lost.  The majority of the population had not benefited from the years of strong growth, which will ultimately only widen the gap between rich and poor. The poverty rate remained at around 50%.<ref>The currency is devalued by 200%, prices are rising sharply (especially gasoline, whose price is multiplied by 30), hundreds of public companies are privatized and 300,000 jobs are being lost.  However, the social balance sheet remains much less positive. The majority of the population has not benefited from the years of strong growth, which will ultimately only widen the gap between rich and poor. The poverty rate remained at around 50%, a level comparable to Alan Garcia's completion rate5.</ref>\n\nAs other dictators did, Fujimori dissolved Congress in the ''[[auto-golpe]]'' of 5 April 1992, in order to have total control of the government of Peru. He then eliminated the constitution; called new congressional elections; and implemented substantial economic reform, including privatization of numerous state-owned companies, creation of an investment-friendly climate, and sound management of the economy.\n\nFujimori's administration was dogged by several insurgent groups, most notably Sendero Luminoso (Shining Path), which carried on a terrorist campaign in the countryside throughout the 1980's and 1990's. He cracked down on the insurgents and was successful in largely quelling them by the late 1990's, but the fight was marred by atrocities committed by both the Peruvian security forces and the insurgents: the [[Barrios Altos massacre]] and [[La Cantuta massacre]] by government paramilitary groups, and the bombings of [[Tarata bombing|Tarata]] and [[Frecuencia Latina bombing|Frecuencia Latina]] by [[Shining Path]]. Those examples subsequently came to be seen as symbols of the human rights violations committed during the last years of violence. With the capture of [[Abimael Guzm\u00e1n]] (known as ''President Gonzalo'' to the Shining Path) in September 1992, the Shining Path received a severe blow which practically destroyed the organization.\n\nIn December 1996, a group of insurgents belonging to the [[T\u00fapac Amaru Revolutionary Movement|MRTA]] [[Japanese embassy hostage crisis|took over the Japanese embassy in Lima]], taking 72 people hostage. Military commandos stormed the embassy compound in May 1997, which resulted in the death of all 15 hostage takers, one hostage, and 2 commandos. It later emerged, however, that Fujimori's security chief [[Vladimiro Montesinos]] may have ordered the killing of at least eight of the rebels after they surrendered.\n\nFujimori's constitutionally questionable decision to seek a third term and subsequent tainted victory in June 2000 brought political and economic turmoil. A bribery scandal that broke just weeks after he took office in July forced Fujimori to call new elections in which he would not run. The scandal involved Vladimiro Montesinos, who was shown in a video broadcast on TV bribing a politician to change sides. Montesinos subsequently emerged as the center a vast web of illegal activities, including embezzlement, graft, drug trafficking, as well as human rights violations committed during the war against Sendero Luminoso.\n\n==== Toledo, Garc\u00eda, Humala, Kuczynski presidencies (2001\u2013today) ====\n\nIn November 2000, Fujimori resigned from office and went to Japan in self-imposed exile, avoiding prosecution for human rights violations and corruption charges by the new Peruvian authorities. His main intelligence chief, [[Vladimiro Montesinos]], fled Peru shortly afterwards. Authorities in Venezuela arrested him in Caracas in June 2001 and turned him over to Peruvian authorities; he is now imprisoned and charged with acts of corruption and human rights violations committed during Fujimori's administration.\n\nA caretaker government presided over by [[Valent\u00edn Paniagua Corazao|Valent\u00edn Paniagua]] took on the responsibility of conducting new presidential and congressional elections. The [[2001 Peruvian general election|elections]] were held in April 2001; observers considered them to be free and fair. [[Alejandro Toledo]] (who led the opposition against Fujimori) defeated former President [[Alan Garc\u00eda]].\n\nThe newly elected government took office on 28 July 2001. The Toledo Administration managed to restore some degree of democracy to Peru following the authoritarianism and corruption that plagued both the Fujimori and Garc\u00eda governments. Innocents wrongfully tried by military courts during the war against terrorism (1980\u20132000) were allowed to receive new trials in civilian courts.\n\nOn 28 August 2003, the [[Truth and Reconciliation Commission (Peru)|Truth and Reconciliation Commission]] (CVR), which had been charged with studying the roots of the violence of the 1980\u20132000 period, presented its formal report to the President.\n\nPresident Toledo was forced to make a number of cabinet changes, mostly in response to personal scandals. Toledo's governing coalition had a minority of seats in Congress and had to negotiate on an ''ad hoc'' basis with other parties to form majorities on legislative proposals. Toledo's popularity in the polls suffered throughout the last years of his regime, due in part to family scandals and in part to dissatisfaction among workers with their share of benefits from Peru's macroeconomic success. After strikes by teachers and agricultural producers led to nationwide road blockages in May 2003, Toledo declared a state of emergency that suspended some civil liberties and gave the military power to enforce order in 12 regions. The state of emergency was later reduced to only the few areas where the Shining Path was operating.\n\nOn 28 July 2006, former president Alan Garc\u00eda became the President of Peru. He won the [[2006 Peruvian election|2006 elections]] after winning in a runoff against [[Ollanta Humala]]. In May 2008, President Garc\u00eda was a signatory to The [[UNASUR Constitutive Treaty]] of the [[Union of South American Nations]]. Peru has ratified the treaty.\n\nOn 5 June 2011, Ollanta Humala was elected President in a run-off against [[Keiko Fujimori]], the daughter of Alberto Fujimori and former [[First Lady]] of Peru, in the [[2011 Peruvian general election|2011 elections]], making him the first leftist president of Peru since [[Juan Velasco Alvarado]]. In December 2011, a state of emergency was declared following popular opposition to some major mining project and environmental concerns.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.andina.com.pe/Ingles/Noticia.aspx?id=AhG0n1njO4I=|title=Peru government declares state of emergency in four Cajamarca provinces|access-date=2011-12-05|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120616191103/http://www.andina.com.pe/Ingles/Noticia.aspx?id=AhG0n1njO4I=|archive-date=2012-06-16|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n[[Pedro Pablo Kuczynski]] was elected president in the [[2016 Peruvian general election|general election]] in July 2016.

The third installment in the [[DC Extended Universe]], it was written and directed by [[David Ayer]] and stars an [[ensemble cast]] including [[Will Smith]], [[Margot Robbie]], [[Jared Leto]], [[Joel Kinnaman]], [[Viola Davis]], [[Jai Courtney]], [[Jay Hernandez]], [[Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje]], [[Scott Eastwood]], [[Karen Fukuhara]], [[Ike Barinholtz]], and [[Cara Delevingne]]. In the film, a secret government agency led by [[Amanda Waller]] recruits imprisoned [[supervillain]]s to execute dangerous black ops missions and save the world from a powerful threat in exchange for reduced sentences.\n\nBy February 2009, a Suicide Squad film was in development at [[Warner Bros.]] Ayer signed on to write and direct in September 2014, and by October, the casting process had begun. [[Principal photography]] began in [[Toronto]], [[Ontario]] on April 13, 2015, with additional filming in [[Chicago]], and ended in August that year.\n\n''Suicide Squad'' premiered in [[New York City]] on August 1, 2016, and was released in the [[United States]] in 2D, [[Real D 3D]], [[IMAX]], and [[IMAX 3D]] on August 5, 2016. Following a strong debut that set new box office records, the film grossed over $746 million worldwide, making it the [[2016 in film|tenth highest-grossing film of 2016]]. It received generally negative<!--- as sourced in Critical reviews section.---> reviews from critics, who criticized its perceived thin plot, direction, editing, and characterization,<!--DO NOT PUT OTHER ACTORS AS IT IS NOT SUPPORTED BY CONSENSUS IN THE PRESS.

The film was nominated for and won multiple awards across various categories, including an [[Academy Awards|Oscar]] for [[Academy Award for Best Makeup and Hairstyling|Best Makeup and Hairstyling]] at the [[89th Academy Awards]], making it the first film in the DCEU to win an Academy Award. It was followed by the [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]] film ''[[Birds of Prey (2020 film)|Birds of Prey]]'', starring Robbie, in 2020, and will be followed by the [[standalone sequel]] ''[[The Suicide Squad (film)|The Suicide Squad]]'' in 2021, with Robbie, Kinnaman, Davis, and Courtney returning.\n\n==Plot==\nIn the [[Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice|one-year aftermath]] of <!-- do not link this to Batman v Superman because it's an easter egg link-->[[Superman]]'s death,{{refn|name=Timeline|group=N|As depicted in the 2016 film ''[[Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice]]''.}}<!--be explicit, see WP:EASTEREGG--> intelligence officer [[Amanda Waller]] convinces [[Washington, D.C.|Washington D.C.]] officials to allow her to assemble [[Suicide Squad|Task Force X]], a team of dangerous criminals imprisoned at Belle Reve Special Security Barracks. The team consists of elite hitman [[Deadshot]], former [[psychiatrist]] [[Harley Quinn]], pyrokinetic ex-gangster [[El Diablo (comics)#Chato Santana|El Diablo]], opportunistic thief [[Captain Boomerang]], genetic mutant [[Killer Croc]], and specialized assassin [[Slipknot (comics)|Slipknot]]. They are placed under command of Colonel [[Rick Flag]] to be used as disposable assets in high-risk missions for the United States government. A nanite bomb is implanted in the neck of each team member, designed to detonate should the member rebel or try to escape.\n\nOne of Waller's intended recruits is Flag's girlfriend [[Enchantress (DC Comics)|Dr. June Moone]], an archaeologist possessed by a demonic witch known as the \"Enchantress\". She quickly turns on Waller for imprisoning her, deciding to eradicate humankind with a mystical weapon. She besieges Midway City by transforming its populace into a horde of monsters, and summons her brother Incubus to assist her. Waller then deploys the squad to extract a high-profile mark from Midway, which is reported to be under a terrorist attack. Joining them is [[Katana (comics)|Katana]], a Japanese swordswoman.\n\nHarley's homicidal lover [[Joker (character)|Joker]] finds out about her predicament and tortures Belle Reve security officer Griggs into leading him to the facility where the nanite bombs are made. There, he blackmails Dr. Van Criss into disabling Harley's bomb. Upon arrival, the squad's helicopter is shot down, forcing them to proceed on foot to their target. Boomerang convinces Slipknot that he believes the bombs are a ruse to keep them in check: the latter attempts to escape and is killed. Meanwhile, the squad is ambushed by Enchantress' minions. They eventually fight their way through to a safe house, where they learn that their mark is Waller herself, who is attempting to cover up her involvement in Enchantress' siege.\n\nThe squad escorts Waller to the rooftop for extraction, but the arriving helicopter has been hijacked by the Joker and his men, who open fire on the squad. Harley's bomb is disarmed by Dr. Van Criss, leaving Flag unable to execute her and allowing her to climb aboard the helicopter. Waller's men subsequently shoot down the helicopter, and Harley falls out while the Joker is presumed dead, after which Harley rejoins the squad. Alerted to Waller's whereabouts, Enchantress' minions arrive and kidnap her. Deadshot finds Waller's confidential files, from which he learns the truth about Enchantress, which Flag then is forced to confirm. This causes the squad members to abandon him. With Waller compromised, Flag relieves the squad of the mission but chooses to continue. Realizing they have an opportunity to prove themselves, they soon rejoin him and locate Enchantress at a partially-flooded subway station. Killer Croc and a group of [[Navy SEAL]]s, led by Lieutenant GQ Edwards, go underwater to plant a bomb underneath Incubus. El Diablo embraces his abilities and distracts Incubus long enough for the bomb to detonate underneath, killing them both as well as Edwards.\n\nThe remaining squad members battle Enchantress together but are ultimately defeated. Enchantress offers to fulfill their deepest desires in exchange for their allegiance, and Harley feigns interest in order to get close enough to cut out Enchantress' heart. Killer Croc then throws explosives into Enchantress' weapon and Deadshot shoots them, destroying the device. Flag takes Enchantress' heart and crushes it, finally freeing June from the curse. Waller, still alive, emerges, and the squad members are returned to Belle Reve with ten years off their sentences. All but Captain Boomerang are allowed special privileges. The Joker, alive and unscathed, breaks into the penitentiary and rescues Harley.\n\nIn a [[mid-credits scene]], Waller meets with [[Batman|Bruce Wayne]], who agrees to protect her from the backlash against her role in Enchantress' rampage in exchange for access to the government's files on the expanding [[metahuman]] community and a document on both [[Flash (Barry Allen)|Barry Allen]] and [[Aquaman|Arthur Curry]]. Waller then advises him to stop working late nights, to which Bruce answers her to shut down Task Force X or else he and his \"[[Justice League (film)|friends]]\" will do it.\n\n==Cast==\n[[File:Suicide Squad by Gage Skidmore.jpg|thumb|Cast of ''Suicide Squad'' at the 2016 [[San Diego Comic-Con]].

The third installment in the [[DC Extended Universe]], it was written and directed by [[David Ayer]] and stars an [[ensemble cast]] including [[Will Smith]], [[Margot Robbie]], [[Jared Leto]], [[Joel Kinnaman]], [[Viola Davis]], [[Jai Courtney]], [[Jay Hernandez]], [[Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje]], [[Scott Eastwood]], [[Karen Fukuhara]], [[Ike Barinholtz]], and [[Cara Delevingne]]. In the film, a secret government agency led by [[Amanda Waller]] recruits imprisoned [[supervillain]]s to execute dangerous black ops missions and save the world from a powerful threat in exchange for reduced sentences.\n\nBy February 2009, a Suicide Squad film was in development at [[Warner Bros.]] Ayer signed on to write and direct in September 2014, and by October, the casting process had begun. [[Principal photography]] began in [[Toronto]], [[Ontario]] on April 13, 2015, with additional filming in [[Chicago]], and ended in August that year.\n\n''Suicide Squad'' premiered in [[New York City]] on August 1, 2016, and was released in the [[United States]] in 2D, [[Real D 3D]], [[IMAX]], and [[IMAX 3D]] on August 5, 2016.

It received generally negative<!--- as sourced in Critical reviews section.---> reviews from critics, who criticized its perceived thin plot, direction, editing, and characterization,<!--DO NOT PUT OTHER ACTORS AS IT IS NOT SUPPORTED BY CONSENSUS IN THE PRESS.

The film was nominated for and won multiple awards across various categories, including an [[Academy Awards|Oscar]] for [[Academy Award for Best Makeup and Hairstyling|Best Makeup and Hairstyling]] at the [[89th Academy Awards]], making it the first film in the DCEU to win an Academy Award. It was followed by the [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]] film ''[[Birds of Prey (2020 film)|Birds of Prey]]'', starring Robbie, in 2020, and will be followed by the [[standalone sequel]] ''[[The Suicide Squad (film)|The Suicide Squad]]'' in 2021, with Robbie, Kinnaman, Davis, and Courtney returning.\n\n==Plot==\nIn the [[Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice|one-year aftermath]] of <!-- do not link this to Batman v Superman because it's an easter egg link-->[[Superman]]'s death,{{refn|name=Timeline|group=N|As depicted in the 2016 film ''[[Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice]]''.}}<!--be explicit, see WP:EASTEREGG--> intelligence officer [[Amanda Waller]] convinces [[Washington, D.C.|Washington D.C.]] officials to allow her to assemble [[Suicide Squad|Task Force X]], a team of dangerous criminals imprisoned at Belle Reve Special Security Barracks. The team consists of elite hitman [[Deadshot]], former [[psychiatrist]] [[Harley Quinn]], pyrokinetic ex-gangster [[El Diablo (comics)#Chato Santana|El Diablo]], opportunistic thief [[Captain Boomerang]], genetic mutant [[Killer Croc]], and specialized assassin [[Slipknot (comics)|Slipknot]]. They are placed under command of Colonel [[Rick Flag]] to be used as disposable assets in high-risk missions for the United States government. A nanite bomb is implanted in the neck of each team member, designed to detonate should the member rebel or try to escape.\n\nOne of Waller's intended recruits is Flag's girlfriend [[Enchantress (DC Comics)|Dr. June Moone]], an archaeologist possessed by a demonic witch known as the \"Enchantress\". She quickly turns on Waller for imprisoning her, deciding to eradicate humankind with a mystical weapon. She besieges Midway City by transforming its populace into a horde of monsters, and summons her brother Incubus to assist her. Waller then deploys the squad to extract a high-profile mark from Midway, which is reported to be under a terrorist attack. Joining them is [[Katana (comics)|Katana]], a Japanese swordswoman.\n\nHarley's homicidal lover [[Joker (character)|Joker]] finds out about her predicament and tortures Belle Reve security officer Griggs into leading him to the facility where the nanite bombs are made. There, he blackmails Dr. Van Criss into disabling Harley's bomb. Upon arrival, the squad's helicopter is shot down, forcing them to proceed on foot to their target. Boomerang convinces Slipknot that he believes the bombs are a ruse to keep them in check: the latter attempts to escape and is killed. Meanwhile, the squad is ambushed by Enchantress' minions. They eventually fight their way through to a safe house, where they learn that their mark is Waller herself, who is attempting to cover up her involvement in Enchantress' siege.\n\nThe squad escorts Waller to the rooftop for extraction, but the arriving helicopter has been hijacked by the Joker and his men, who open fire on the squad. Harley's bomb is disarmed by Dr. Van Criss, leaving Flag unable to execute her and allowing her to climb aboard the helicopter. Waller's men subsequently shoot down the helicopter, and Harley falls out while the Joker is presumed dead, after which Harley rejoins the squad. Alerted to Waller's whereabouts, Enchantress' minions arrive and kidnap her. Deadshot finds Waller's confidential files, from which he learns the truth about Enchantress, which Flag then is forced to confirm. This causes the squad members to abandon him. With Waller compromised, Flag relieves the squad of the mission but chooses to continue. Realizing they have an opportunity to prove themselves, they soon rejoin him and locate Enchantress at a partially-flooded subway station. Killer Croc and a group of [[Navy SEAL]]s, led by Lieutenant GQ Edwards, go underwater to plant a bomb underneath Incubus. El Diablo embraces his abilities and distracts Incubus long enough for the bomb to detonate underneath, killing them both as well as Edwards.\n\nThe remaining squad members battle Enchantress together but are ultimately defeated. Enchantress offers to fulfill their deepest desires in exchange for their allegiance, and Harley feigns interest in order to get close enough to cut out Enchantress' heart. Killer Croc then throws explosives into Enchantress' weapon and Deadshot shoots them, destroying the device. Flag takes Enchantress' heart and crushes it, finally freeing June from the curse. Waller, still alive, emerges, and the squad members are returned to Belle Reve with ten years off their sentences. All but Captain Boomerang are allowed special privileges. The Joker, alive and unscathed, breaks into the penitentiary and rescues Harley.\n\nIn a [[mid-credits scene]], Waller meets with [[Batman|Bruce Wayne]], who agrees to protect her from the backlash against her role in Enchantress' rampage in exchange for access to the government's files on the expanding [[metahuman]] community and a document on both [[Flash (Barry Allen)|Barry Allen]] and [[Aquaman|Arthur Curry]]. Waller then advises him to stop working late nights, to which Bruce answers her to shut down Task Force X or else he and his \"[[Justice League (film)|friends]]\" will do it.\n\n==Cast==\n[[File:Suicide Squad by Gage Skidmore.jpg|thumb|Cast of ''Suicide Squad'' at the 2016 [[San Diego Comic-Con]].
