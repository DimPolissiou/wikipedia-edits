They compete as a member of the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association]] (NCAA) [[NCAA Division I|Division I]] level ([[NCAA Division I Football Bowl Subdivision|Football Bowl Subdivision]] (FBS) sub-level for football), primarily competing in the [[Atlantic Coast Conference]] (ACC) for all sports since the 1953\u201354 season. Clemson competes for and has won multiple NCAA Division I national championships in various sports, including football, men's soccer, and men's golf.\n\nIn 1896, football coach [[Walter Riggs]] came to Clemson, then Clemson Agricultural College of South Carolina, from [[Auburn University]]. He had always admired the Princeton Tigers, and hence gave Clemson the Tiger mascot. The Clemson Tigers field seventeen athletic teams. The [[South Carolina Gamecocks]] are Clemson's in-state athletic rival. The two institutions compete against each other in many sports, but the annual football game receives the most attention. Clemson's main rivals within the Atlantic Coast Conference are Georgia Tech and [[Florida State Seminoles|Florida State]].\n\n==Tiger Paw logo==\nThe Tiger Paw logo was introduced at a press conference on July 21, 1970. It was created by [[John Antonio]] and developed by Helen Weaver of Henderson Advertising in [[Greenville, South Carolina]], from a mold of a [[Bengal tiger]] sent to the agency by the [[Field Museum of Natural History]] in [[Chicago]].<ref>{{cite web|title=TIGER PAW LOGO RANKED SECOND IN THE NATION BY ATHLON SPORTS|url=http://www.clemsontigers.com/tiger-paw-logo-ranked-second-in-the-nation-by-athlon-sports/|publisher=Clemson Tigers Athletics|accessdate=November 3, 2018}}</ref><ref name=\"gn\">{{cite news |first=Mandrallius |last=Robinson |title=Antonio, creator of Clemson's paw logo, dies |url=http://www.greenvilleonline.com/article/20130530/NEWS/305300047/Antonio-creator-Clemson-s-paw-logo-dies |work=[[The Greenville News]] |date=May 31, 2013 |accessdate=June 29, 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130630034133/http://www.greenvilleonline.com/article/20130530/NEWS/305300047/Antonio-creator-Clemson-s-paw-logo-dies |archivedate=June 30, 2013}}</ref><ref name=\"pc\">{{cite news|first=Aaron|last=Brenner|title=1970 designer of Clemson's Tiger Paw logo, John Antonio, dies of cancer|url=http://blog.postandcourier.com/tiger-tracks/2013/05/30/1970-designer-clemsons-tiger-paw-logo-john-antonio-dies-cancer-thursday/|work=[[The Post and Courier]]|date=May 30, 2013|accessdate=June 29, 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140306055124/http://blog.postandcourier.com/tiger-tracks/2013/05/30/1970-designer-clemsons-tiger-paw-logo-john-antonio-dies-cancer-thursday/|archivedate=March 6, 2014}}</ref> The telltale hook at the bottom of the paw is a sign that this is the official licensed trademark for the university.<ref>{{cite web|title=Logos|url=https://www.clemson.edu/brand/guide/logo.html|publisher=Clemson University|accessdate=November 3, 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Teams==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"float:right; clear:right; margin:0 0 1em 1em;\"\n|-\n{{CollegePrimaryHeader|team=Clemson Tigers|Men's sports|Women's sports}}\n|good team wins 1 millon games a day :) poor friend me on roblox it is omgitsoliveboi boom ya clap doo\n| [[Clemson Tigers baseball|Baseball]] || [[Clemson Tigers women's basketball|Basketball]]\n|-\n| [[Clemson Tigers men's basketball|Basketball]] || Cross country\n|-\n| Cross country || Golf\n|-\n| [[Clemson Tigers football|Football]] || Lacrosse\n|-\n| Golf || Rowing\n|-\n| [[Clemson Tigers men's soccer|Soccer]] || [[Clemson Tigers women's soccer|Soccer]]\n|-\n| Tennis || [[Clemson Tigers women's tennis|Tennis]]\n|-\n| Track and field<sup>\u2020</sup> || Track and field<sup>\u2020</sup>\n|-\n| || Volleyball\n|-\n| colspan=\"2\" style=\"{{NCAA secondary color cell|Clemson Tigers}}\" | {{small|\u2020 \u2013 Track and field includes both indoor and outdoor.}}\n|}\nClemson University sponsors teams in nine men's and nine and a half* women's [[NCAA]] sanctioned sports.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.clemsontigers.com/|title=Clemson Tigers Official Athletics Site|website=www.clemsontigers.com}}</ref> Women's diving completed its final season in 2017, and Clemson announced on March 14, 2017, that it would add [[college softball]], targeting a 2020 start for the program.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.clemsontigers.com/ViewArticle.dbml?DB_OEM_ID=28500&ATCLID=211519897 |publisher=Clemson Tigers |date=March 14, 2017 |accessdate=March 14, 2017 |title=Clemson to Add Softball |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170314175236/http://www.clemsontigers.com/ViewArticle.dbml?DB_OEM_ID=28500&ATCLID=211519897 |archive-date=March 14, 2017 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n===Football===\n{{Main article|Clemson Tigers football}}\n\n[[File:Clemson death valley.jpg|right|300px]]\nClemson has three national championships in football, the most recent coming in 2018 with a victory over Alabama in the [[2019 College Football Playoff National Championship]].

Clemson also won two [[Southern Conference]] titles before joining the [[Atlantic Coast Conference|ACC]]. The 1981 squad, led by Head Coach Danny Ford, became the first athletic team in school history to win a national championship. Clemson defeated Nebraska 22&ndash;15 in the Orange Bowl in Miami, Florida, to win the 1981 NCAA Football National Championship. Stars of the game included Homer Jordan (QB) and Perry Tuttle (WR). Clemson finished the year 12&ndash;0 and ranked #1 in the Associated Press and Coaches polls.\n\nSome of the most notable coaching names in Clemson football history are [[John Heisman]] (who also coached at Akron, Auburn, Georgia Tech, Penn, Washington & Jefferson, and Rice; the [[Heisman Trophy]] is named after him), [[Jess Neely]], [[Frank Howard (football coach)|Frank Howard]] (whom the playing field at Death Valley is named after), and [[Danny Ford]].

With five minutes to go before game time, three buses leave the street behind the West Endzone carrying the Clemson football players. The buses pull to a stop at the gate in front of The Hill, and the Tigers gather at the top, where each player proceeds to rub \"Howard's Rock,\" which is an imported rock from Death Valley, California that was presented to Frank Howard in 1967. While Tiger Rag is played and a cannon sounds, the Tigers run down the hill onto the field in front of over 83,000 screaming fans.

The film stars [[Danny Glover]], [[Gene Hackman]], [[Anjelica Huston]], [[Bill Murray]], [[Gwyneth Paltrow]], [[Ben Stiller]], [[Luke Wilson]], and Owen Wilson. Ostensibly based on a non-existent novel, and told with a narrative influenced by the literature of [[J.D. Salinger]], the story follows the lives of three gifted siblings who experience great success in youth, and even greater disappointment and failure in adulthood. The children's [[Eccentricity (behavior)|eccentric]] father Royal Tenenbaum (Hackman) leaves them in their adolescent years, returning to them after they have grown, and falsely claiming to have a [[terminal illness]]. Long after he was shunned by his family, Royal gradually reconciles with his children and ex-wife (Huston).\n\nWith a variety of influences, including [[Louis Malle]]'s 1963 film ''[[The Fire Within]]'' and [[Orson Welles]]' 1942 film ''[[The Magnificent Ambersons (film)|The Magnificent Ambersons]]'', the story involves themes of the [[dysfunctional family]], lost greatness, and redemption. An [[Absurdism|absurdist]] and ironic sense of humor pervades the film, which features a [[The Royal Tenenbaums (soundtrack)|soundtrack]] subsequently released in two albums.\n\n''The Royal Tenenbaums'' was shot in and around New York City, including a house in [[Harlem]] used for the Tenenbaum residence. The filmmakers went to efforts to distinguish the film's backgrounds from a recognizable New York, with fashions and sets combining the appearances of different time periods.\n\nAfter debuting at the [[New York Film Festival]], ''The Royal Tenenbaums'' received positive reviews from critics and was Anderson's most financially successful film until 2014's ''[[The Grand Budapest Hotel]]''. Hackman won a [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actor \u2013 Motion Picture Musical or Comedy|Golden Globe]] for his performance, and the screenwriters were nominated for the [[Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay]]. In 2016, it was included in [[BBC's 100 Greatest Films of the 21st Century]].\n\n== Plot ==\nRoyal Tenenbaum explains to his three adolescent children, Chas, Margot, and Richie, that he and his wife, Etheline, are separating. Each of the children achieved great success at a young age. Chas is a math and business genius, from whom Royal steals money. Margot, who was adopted, was awarded a grant for a play that she wrote in the ninth grade. Richie is a [[tennis]] [[child prodigy|prodigy]] and artist. He expresses his love for Margot through paintings. Royal takes Richie on regular outings without the other children. Eli Cash is the Tenenbaums' neighbor and Richie's best friend.\n\nTwenty-two years later, Royal is kicked out of the hotel where he has been living. The children are in a post-success slump, with Richie traveling the world on a [[cruise ship]], following a breakdown. He writes to Eli revealing his love for Margot. Chas has become overprotective of his sons, Ari and Uzi, following his wife Rachael's death in a plane crash. Margot is married to [[neurologist]] Raleigh St. Clair, from whom she hides her smoking and her checkered past. Raleigh is conducting research on a subject named Dudley Heinsbergen.\n\nEtheline's longtime accountant, Henry Sherman, proposes to her. Learning of Henry's proposal, Royal claims that he has [[stomach cancer]] to win back his wife's and children's affections. Etheline calls her children home, and Royal moves back in and sets up medical equipment in Richie's room. Royal learns of Chas' overprotective nature and takes his grandsons on an adventure involving [[shoplifting]] and [[dog fighting]]. On their return, Chas berates him for endangering his boys while Royal accuses Chas of having a [[nervous breakdown]].\n\nEli, with whom Margot has been having an affair, tells her that Richie loves her. Royal discovers the affair and objects to Margot's treatment of Raleigh, who confides to Richie his suspicions of Margot. He and Richie hire a [[private investigator]] to surveil her. Meanwhile, Henry investigates Royal's cancer claim and discovers his hospital had closed, his doctor does not exist, and that his cancer medication is only candy. He confronts Pagoda, the servant, and gathers the family to tell them. Afterwards, Royal and Pagoda move out.\n\nRichie and Raleigh get the private eye's report on Margot, which reveals her history of smoking and sexual promiscuity, including a previous marriage to a [[Jamaican people|Jamaican]] recording artist. Both men take the news hard, with Richie going into a bathroom, shaving off his hair and beard, and slashing his wrists. Dudley finds him and Raleigh rushes him to hospital. As the Tenenbaums sit in the waiting room, Raleigh confronts Margot and then leaves. Richie escapes and meets with Margot. They share their secret love and they kiss.\n\nRoyal decides that he wants Etheline to be happy, and finally arranges for a divorce. Before Henry and Etheline's wedding, Eli, high on [[mescaline]], crashes his car into the side of the house. Royal rescues Ari and Uzi, but the boys' dog, Buckley, is killed. Enraged, Chas chases Eli through the house and wrestles him to the ground. Eli and Chas agree that they both need psychiatric help. Chas thanks Royal for saving his sons and for buying them a [[Dalmatian (dog)|Dalmatian]] from the responding firemen as a replacement for Buckley. Forty-eight hours later, Etheline and Henry are married in a judge's [[Chambers (law)|chambers]].\n\nSome time later, Margot releases a new play inspired by her family, Raleigh publishes a book about Dudley's condition, Eli checks himself into a drug rehabilitation facility in North Dakota, and Richie begins teaching a junior tennis program. Chas becomes less overprotective of his children. Royal seems to have improved his relationship with all his children, and seems to be on better terms with Etheline. He has a [[heart attack]] and dies at the age of 68. Chas accompanies him in the ambulance on the way to the hospital, and is the only witness to his death. The family attends his funeral, where the [[epitaph]] dubiously reads that he \"Died tragically rescuing his family from the wreckage of a destroyed sinking battleship.\"\n\n== Cast ==\n{{multiple image\n | align     = right\n | direction = horizontal\n | footer    = [[Gene Hackman]] and [[Anjelica Huston]] star as Royal and Etheline Tenenbaum.\n | footer_align = left\n | width     =\n | image1    = GeneHackmanJun08.jpg\n | width1    = 150\n | alt1      =\n | image2    = Anjelica Huston1.JPG\n | width2    = 148\n | alt2      =\n}}\n''The Royal Tenenbaums'' has an [[ensemble cast]],<ref name=\"TIMEStaff\">{{cite journal |url=http://entertainment.time.com/2009/04/23/top-10-troubled-genius-films/slide/the-royal-tenenbaums-2001/ |author=Staff |date=April 23, 2009 |title=Top 10 Troubled Genius Films |accessdate=September 19, 2017 |journal=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170323110906/http://entertainment.time.com/2009/04/23/top-10-troubled-genius-films/slide/the-royal-tenenbaums-2001/ |archivedate=March 23, 2017 }}</ref><ref name=\"Redshaw\">{{cite web |url=http://old.post-gazette.com/movies/20020106tenenp3.asp |last=Redshaw |first=Rebecca |date=January 6, 2002 |title='Tenenbaums' writer/director attracts stellar cast, led by Gene Hackman |accessdate=September 19, 2017 |work=[[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]] |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170919140543/http://old.post-gazette.com/movies/20020106tenenp3.asp |archivedate=September 19, 2017 }}</ref> led by Hackman.<ref name=\"Redshaw\" /><ref name=\"Queenan\" /> [[Alec Baldwin]] also serves as the narrator.<ref name=\"Queenan\">{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2002/mar/16/features.joequeenan |title=Gene therapy |last=Queenan |first=Joe |accessdate=September 18, 2017 |date=March 16, 2002 |work=[[The Guardian]] |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170917050059/https://www.theguardian.com/film/2002/mar/16/features.joequeenan |archivedate=September 17, 2017 }}</ref> The fictional family and performers are:<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.berlinale.de/external/de/filmarchiv/doku_pdf/20020197.pdf |date=2002 |title=The Royal Tenenbaums |accessdate=September 19, 2017 |publisher=[[Berlin International Film Festival]] |language=German |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040823044546/http://www.berlinale.de/external/de/filmarchiv/doku_pdf/20020197.pdf |archivedate=August 23, 2004 }}</ref>\n{{chart/start}}\n{{chart | RT | y | ET |~| HS | | | | | | RT = Royal Tenenbaum<br />([[Gene Hackman]]) |ET = Etheline Tenenbaum<br />([[Anjelica Huston]]) |HS = Henry Sherman<br />([[Danny Glover]]) }}\n{{chart | | , | -

The film stars [[Danny Glover]], [[Gene Hackman]], [[Anjelica Huston]], [[Bill Murray]], [[Gwyneth Paltrow]], [[Ben Stiller]], [[Luke Wilson]], and Owen Wilson. Ostensibly based on a non-existent novel, and told with a narrative influenced by the literature of [[J.D. Salinger]], the story follows the lives of three gifted siblings who experience great success in youth, and even greater disappointment and failure in adulthood. The children's [[Eccentricity (behavior)|eccentric]] father Royal Tenenbaum (Hackman) leaves them in their adolescent years, returning to them after they have grown, and falsely claiming to have a [[terminal illness]]. Long after he was shunned by his family, Royal gradually reconciles with his children and ex-wife (Huston).\n\nWith a variety of influences, including [[Louis Malle]]'s 1963 film ''[[The Fire Within]]'' and [[Orson Welles]]' 1942 film ''[[The Magnificent Ambersons (film)|The Magnificent Ambersons]]'', the story involves themes of the [[dysfunctional family]], lost greatness, and redemption. An [[Absurdism|absurdist]] and ironic sense of humor pervades the film, which features a [[The Royal Tenenbaums (soundtrack)|soundtrack]] subsequently released in two albums.\n\n''The Royal Tenenbaums'' was shot in and around New York City, including a house in [[Harlem]] used for the Tenenbaum residence. The filmmakers went to efforts to distinguish the film's backgrounds from a recognizable New York, with fashions and sets combining the appearances of different time periods.\n\nAfter debuting at the [[New York Film Festival]], ''The Royal Tenenbaums'' received positive reviews from critics and was Anderson's most financially successful film until 2014's ''[[The Grand Budapest Hotel]]''. Hackman won a [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actor \u2013 Motion Picture Musical or Comedy|Golden Globe]] for his performance, and the screenwriters were nominated for the [[Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay]]. In 2016, it was included in [[BBC's 100 Greatest Films of the 21st Century]].\n\n== Plot ==\nRoyal Tenenbaum explains to his three adolescent children, Chas, Margot, and Richie, that he and his wife, Etheline, are separating. Each of the children achieved great success at a young age. Chas is a math and business genius, from whom Royal steals money. Margot, who was adopted, was awarded a grant for a play that she wrote in the ninth grade. Richie is a [[tennis]] [[child prodigy|prodigy]] and artist. He expresses his love for Margot through paintings. Royal takes Richie on regular outings without the other children. Eli Cash is the Tenenbaums' neighbor and Richie's best friend.\n\nTwenty-two years later, Royal is kicked out of the hotel where he has been living. The children are in a post-success slump, with Richie traveling the world on a [[cruise ship]], following a breakdown. He writes to Eli revealing his love for Margot. Chas has become overprotective of his sons, Ari and Uzi, following his wife Rachael's death in a plane crash. Margot is married to [[neurologist]] Raleigh St. Clair, from whom she hides her smoking and her checkered past. Raleigh is conducting research on a subject named Dudley Heinsbergen.\n\nEtheline's longtime accountant, Henry Sherman, proposes to her. Learning of Henry's proposal, Royal claims that he has [[stomach cancer]] to win back his wife's and children's affections. Etheline calls her children home, and Royal moves back in and sets up medical equipment in Richie's room. Royal learns of Chas' overprotective nature and takes his grandsons on an adventure involving [[shoplifting]] and [[dog fighting]]. On their return, Chas berates him for endangering his boys while Royal accuses Chas of having a [[nervous breakdown]].\n\nEli, with whom Margot has been having an affair, tells her that Richie loves her. Royal discovers the affair and objects to Margot's treatment of Raleigh, who confides to Richie his suspicions of Margot. He and Richie hire a [[private investigator]] to surveil her. Meanwhile, Henry investigates Royal's cancer claim and discovers his hospital had closed, his doctor does not exist, and that his cancer medication is only candy. He confronts Pagoda, the servant, and gathers the family to tell them. Afterwards, Royal and Pagoda move out.\n\nRichie and Raleigh get the private eye's report on Margot, which reveals her history of smoking and sexual promiscuity, including a previous marriage to a [[Jamaican people|Jamaican]] recording artist. Both men take the news hard, with Richie going into a bathroom, shaving off his hair and beard, and slashing his wrists. Dudley finds him and Raleigh rushes him to hospital. As the Tenenbaums sit in the waiting room, Raleigh confronts Margot and then leaves. Richie escapes and meets with Margot. They share their secret love and they kiss.\n\nRoyal decides that he wants Etheline to be happy, and finally arranges for a divorce. Before Henry and Etheline's wedding, Eli, high on [[mescaline]], crashes his car into the side of the house. Royal rescues Ari and Uzi, but the boys' dog, Buckley, is killed. Enraged, Chas chases Eli through the house and wrestles him to the ground. Eli and Chas agree that they both need psychiatric help. Chas thanks Royal for saving his sons and for buying them a [[Dalmatian (dog)|Dalmatian]] from the responding firemen as a replacement for Buckley. Forty-eight hours later, Etheline and Henry are married in a judge's [[Chambers (law)|chambers]].\n\nSome time later, Margot releases a new play inspired by her family, Raleigh publishes a book about Dudley's condition, Eli checks himself into a drug rehabilitation facility in North Dakota, and Richie begins teaching a junior tennis program. Chas becomes less overprotective of his children. Royal seems to have improved his relationship with all his children, and seems to be on better terms with Etheline. He has a [[heart attack]] and dies at the age of 68. Chas accompanies him in the ambulance on the way to the hospital, and is the only witness to his death. The family attends his funeral, where the [[epitaph]] dubiously reads that he \"Died tragically rescuing his family from the wreckage of a destroyed sinking battleship.\"\n\n== Cast ==\n{{multiple image\n | align     = right\n | direction = horizontal\n | footer    = [[Gene Hackman]] and [[Anjelica Huston]] star as Royal and Etheline Tenenbaum.\n | footer_align = left\n | width     =\n | image1    = GeneHackmanJun08.jpg\n | width1    = 150\n | alt1      =\n | image2    = Anjelica Huston1.JPG\n | width2    = 148\n | alt2      =\n}}\n''The Royal Tenenbaums'' has an [[ensemble cast]],<ref name=\"TIMEStaff\">{{cite journal |url=http://entertainment.time.com/2009/04/23/top-10-troubled-genius-films/slide/the-royal-tenenbaums-2001/ |author=Staff |date=April 23, 2009 |title=Top 10 Troubled Genius Films |accessdate=September 19, 2017 |journal=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170323110906/http://entertainment.time.com/2009/04/23/top-10-troubled-genius-films/slide/the-royal-tenenbaums-2001/ |archivedate=March 23, 2017 }}</ref><ref name=\"Redshaw\">{{cite web |url=http://old.post-gazette.com/movies/20020106tenenp3.asp |last=Redshaw |first=Rebecca |date=January 6, 2002 |title='Tenenbaums' writer/director attracts stellar cast, led by Gene Hackman |accessdate=September 19, 2017 |work=[[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]] |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170919140543/http://old.post-gazette.com/movies/20020106tenenp3.asp |archivedate=September 19, 2017 }}</ref> led by Hackman.<ref name=\"Redshaw\" /><ref name=\"Queenan\" /> [[Alec Baldwin]] also serves as the narrator.<ref name=\"Queenan\">{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2002/mar/16/features.joequeenan |title=Gene therapy |last=Queenan |first=Joe |accessdate=September 18, 2017 |date=March 16, 2002 |work=[[The Guardian]] |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170917050059/https://www.theguardian.com/film/2002/mar/16/features.joequeenan |archivedate=September 17, 2017 }}</ref> The fictional family and performers are:<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.berlinale.de/external/de/filmarchiv/doku_pdf/20020197.pdf |date=2002 |title=The Royal Tenenbaums |accessdate=September 19, 2017 |publisher=[[Berlin International Film Festival]] |language=German |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040823044546/http://www.berlinale.de/external/de/filmarchiv/doku_pdf/20020197.pdf |archivedate=August 23, 2004 }}</ref>\n{{chart/start}}\n{{chart | RT | y | ET |~| HS | | | | | | RT = Royal Tenenbaum<br />([[Gene Hackman]]) |ET = Etheline Tenenbaum<br />([[Anjelica Huston]]) |HS = Henry Sherman<br />([[Danny Glover]]) }}\n{{chart | | , | -

Reduced risk of ectopic pregnancy. Compared with women who use no contraceptive at all, women who use DMPA have a reduced risk for having an ectopic pregnancy. Although the overall risk of pregnancy and thus ectopic pregnancy is lowered by DMPA, the possibility of an ectopic pregnancy should be excluded if a woman using DMPA becomes pregnant.

Critics of the study claimed that dogs are more sensitive to artificial progesterone, and that the doses were too high to extrapolate to humans. The FDA pointed out that all substances carcinogenic to humans are carcinogenic to animals as well, and that if a substance is not carcinogenic it does not register as a carcinogen at high doses. Levels of DMPA which caused malignant mammary tumors in dogs were equivalent to 25 times the amount of the normal [[luteal phase]] progesterone level for dogs.

Women whose known medical conditions indicated that use of DMPA would endanger their health were given the shot. Several of the women in the study died; some of cancer, but some for other reasons, such as suicide due to depression.

Reduced risk of ectopic pregnancy. Compared with women who use no contraceptive at all, women who use DMPA have a reduced risk for having an ectopic pregnancy.

Ultimately, on October 29, 1992, the FDA approved DMPA for birth control, which had by then been used by over 30 million women since 1969 and was approved and being used by nearly 9&nbsp;million women in more than 90&nbsp;countries, including the [[United Kingdom]], [[France]], [[Germany]], [[Sweden]], [[Thailand]], [[New Zealand]] and [[Indonesia]].<ref name=Leary1992>{{cite journal | vauthors = Leary WE | title = U.S. approves injectable drug as birth control | journal = The New York Times on the Web | pages = A1, A14 | date = October 1992 | pmid = 11646958 | url = https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?sec=health&res=9E0CE1DD123BF933A05753C1A964958260 | url-status = live | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20081208133159/http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?sec=health&res=9E0CE1DD123BF933A05753C1A964958260 | archivedate = 2008-12-08 }}</ref> Points in the controversy included:\n* Animal testing for [[carcinogenicity]] \u2013 DMPA caused breast cancer tumors in dogs. Critics of the study claimed that dogs are more sensitive to artificial progesterone, and that the doses were too high to extrapolate to humans. The FDA pointed out that all substances carcinogenic to humans are carcinogenic to animals as well, and that if a substance is not carcinogenic it does not register as a carcinogen at high doses. Levels of DMPA which caused malignant mammary tumors in dogs were equivalent to 25 times the amount of the normal [[luteal phase]] progesterone level for dogs. This is lower than the pregnancy level of progesterone for dogs, and is species-specific.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.inchem.org/documents/iarc/suppl7/progestins.html|title=Progestins (IARC Summary & Evaluation, Supplement7, 1987)|accessdate=15 October 2016|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171107030422/http://www.inchem.org/documents/iarc/suppl7/progestins.html|archivedate=7 November 2017}}</ref><br />DMPA caused endometrial cancer in monkeys \u2013 2 of 12 monkeys tested, the first ever recorded cases of endometrial cancer in [[rhesus monkeys]].<ref name=\"MM_Goodman1985\">{{Cite journal | author=Amy Goodman | title=The Case Against Depo-Provera - Problems in the U.S | journal=Multinational Monitor | date=February\u2013March 1985 | volume=6 | issue=2 & 3 | url=http://www.multinationalmonitor.org/hyper/issues/1985/02/problems-us.html | url-status=live | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061003000448/http://www.multinationalmonitor.org/hyper/issues/1985/02/problems-us.html | archivedate=2006-10-03 }}</ref> However, subsequent studies have shown that in humans, DMPA ''reduces'' the risk of endometrial cancer by approximately 80%.<ref name=\"Kaunitz\"/><ref name=\"BrJFP_Bigrigg1999\"/><ref name=\"WHO DMPA EC\"/><br />Speaking in comparative terms regarding animal studies of carcinogenicity for medications, a member of the FDA's Bureau of Drugs testified at an agency DMPA hearing, \"...Animal data for this drug is more worrisome than any other drug we know of that is to be given to well people.\"\n* Cervical cancer in Upjohn/NCI studies.

Investigators who eventually visited noted that the studies were disorganized. \"They found that data collection was questionable, consent forms and protocol were absent; that those women whose consent had been obtained at all were not told of possible side effects. Women whose known medical conditions indicated that use of DMPA would endanger their health were given the shot. Several of the women in the study died; some of cancer, but some for other reasons, such as suicide due to depression.

The [[National Women's Health Network]] and other women's organizations testified at the hearing that the WHO was not objective, as the WHO had already distributed DMPA in developing countries. DMPA was approved for use in United States on the basis of the WHO review of previously submitted evidence from countries such as Thailand, evidence which the FDA had deemed insufficient and too poorly designed for assessment of cancer risk at a prior hearing.\n* The Alan Guttmacher Institute has speculated that United States approval of DMPA may increase its availability and acceptability in developing countries.<ref name=\"albion\">{{cite web|last1=Hawkins |first1=Karen |last2=Elliott |first2=Jeff |name-list-format=vanc |date=5 May 1996 |url=http://www.monitor.net/monitor/controlled/bc-depohearing.html |archive-date=21 November 2015 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151121180041/http://www.monitor.net/monitor/controlled/bc-depohearing.html |title=Seeking Approval |work=Albion Monitor |accessdate=20 November 2006 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Singh S | title = Adolescent knowledge and use of injectable contraceptives in developing countries | journal = The Journal of Adolescent Health | volume = 16 | issue = 5 | pages = 396\u2013404 | date = May 1995 | pmid = 7662691 | doi = 10.1016/S1054-139X(94)00060-R }}</ref>\n* In 1995, several women's health groups asked the FDA to put a moratorium on DMPA, and to institute standardized informed consent forms.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = | title = Clinicians clash with consumer groups over possible Depo ban | journal = Contraceptive Technology Update | volume = 16 | issue = 1 | pages = 11\u20134 | date = January 1995 | pmid = 12319319 }}</ref>\n\n==Research==\nDMPA was studied by [[Upjohn]] for use as a [[progestogen-only injectable contraceptive]] in women at a dose of 50&nbsp;mg once a month but produced poor cycle control and was not marketed for this use at this dosage.<ref name=\"pmid865726\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Toppozada M | title = The clinical use of monthly injectable contraceptive preparations | journal = Obstet Gynecol Surv | volume = 32 | issue = 6 | pages = 335\u201347 | date = June 1977 | pmid = 865726 | doi = 10.1097/00006254-197706000-00001 | url = }}</ref> A combination of DMPA and [[polyestradiol phosphate]], an [[estrogen (medication)|estrogen]] and long-lasting [[prodrug]] of [[estradiol (medication)|estradiol]], was studied in women as a [[combined injectable contraceptive]] for use by [[intramuscular injection]] once every three months.<ref name=\"GoldzieherFotherby1994\">{{cite book|author1=Joseph William Goldzieher|author2=Kenneth Fotherby|title=Pharmacology of the contraceptive steroids|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bJRsAAAAMAAJ|year=1994|publisher=Raven Press|isbn=978-0-7817-0097-9|page=154}}</ref><ref name=\"pmid5925038\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Za\u00f1artu J, Rice-Wray E, Goldzieher JW | title = Fertility control with long-acting injectable steroids.

Recording sessions took place during 2005 to 2007 at several studios in New York and Los Angeles. It was primarily produced by West himself, with contributions from various other producers. The album also features [[Guest appearance#Contemporary music|guest appearances]] from recording artists such as [[Dwele]], [[T-Pain]], [[Lil Wayne]], [[DJ Premier]], and [[Chris Martin]] of [[Coldplay]]. The cover art and its interior artwork were designed by Japanese contemporary artist [[Takashi Murakami]], who would also design the cover art for West's collaborative album with [[Kid Cudi]], eponymously titled ''[[Kids See Ghosts (album)|Kids See Ghosts]]'' (2018).\n\nInspired by [[Stadium rock|stadium]] [[Concert tour|tours]], [[House music|house-music]] and [[indie rock]], ''Graduation'' marked a departure from the ornate, [[soul music|soul]]-based sound of West's previous releases as he musically progressed to more anthemic compositions. West incorporated layered [[synthesizer]]s and dabbled with [[electronic music|electronics]] while [[Sample (music)|sampling]] from various [[music genre]]s and altering his approach to [[rapping]]. He conveys an ambivalent outlook on his newfound fame and media scrutiny alongside providing inspirational messages of triumph directed at listeners. ''Graduation'' concludes the education theme of West's first two albums ''[[The College Dropout]]'' (2004) and ''[[Late Registration]]'' (2005). \n\n''Graduation'' debuted at number one on the US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]], selling over 957,000 copies in the first week of sales. It has since sold over 2.7 million copies in the United States and been certified [[RIAA certification|double platinum]] by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA). Five accompanying singles were released, including the international hits \"[[Stronger (Kanye West song)|Stronger]]\", \"[[Good Life (Kanye West song)|Good Life]]\" and \"[[Homecoming (Kanye West song)|Homecoming]]\", the former of which topped the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]. The album received widely positive reviews from [[Music journalism|music critics]], with several of them praising the production, and earned West his third [[Grammy Award for Best Rap Album]], as well as his third nomination for [[Grammy Award for Album of the Year|Album of the Year]]. It was named as one the best albums of 2007 by multiple publications, including ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' and ''[[USA Today]]'', while also listed among numerous decade-end lists.\n\nThe coinciding release dates between ''Graduation'' and rapper [[50 Cent]]'s ''[[Curtis (50 Cent album)|Curtis]]'' generated much publicity over the idea of a sales competition, resulting in record-breaking sales performances by both albums.

Within the song, West dually details his love and admiration as well as his envy and antagonism towards Jay Z, metaphorically equating their relationship to that of a [[sibling rivalry]].<ref name=Praise/> West also uses the song's chorus as a subsidiary dedication to his mentor [[No I.D.]], who first taught him how to produce music.<ref>{{cite book |title=Kanye West in the Studio: Beats Down!

The majority of song is composed of repetitive recitations of its choruses and bridges by Mos Def and Al Be Back. West melodically raps only one single verse in which he nostalgically reminisces over taking trips to the museum with his grandparents. As his verse draws to a close, West chastises that a person can't dwell on the past, and charges himself with living his life like he has no tomorrow. In retrospect, with the death of his mother [[Donda West]] less than two months after the album was released in addition to the dissolution of his engagement with fianc\u00e9e Alexis Phifer, the trace

and producer [[Kanye West]], released on September 11, 2007, through [[Def Jam Recordings]] and [[Roc-A-Fella Records]]. Recording sessions took place during 2005 to 2007 at several studios in New York and Los Angeles. It was primarily produced by West himself, with contributions from various other producers. The album also features [[Guest appearance#Contemporary music|guest appearances]] from recording artists such as [[Dwele]], [[T-Pain]], [[Lil Wayne]], [[DJ Premier]], and [[Chris Martin]] of [[Coldplay]]. The cover art and its interior artwork were designed by Japanese contemporary artist [[Takashi Murakami]], who would also design the cover art for West's collaborative album with [[Kid Cudi]], eponymously titled ''[[Kids See Ghosts (album)|Kids See Ghosts]]'' (2018).\n\nInspired by [[Stadium rock|stadium]] [[Concert tour|tours]], [[House music|house-music]] and [[indie rock]], ''Graduation'' marked a departure from the ornate, [[soul music|soul]]-based sound of West's previous releases as he musically progressed to more anthemic compositions. West incorporated layered [[synthesizer]]s and dabbled with [[electronic music|electronics]] while [[Sample (music)|sampling]] from various [[music genre]]s and altering his approach to [[rapping]]. He conveys an ambivalent outlook on his newfound fame and media scrutiny alongside providing inspirational messages of triumph directed at listeners. ''Graduation'' concludes the education theme of West's first two albums ''[[The College Dropout]]'' (2004) and ''[[Late Registration]]'' (2005). \n\n''Graduation'' debuted at number one on the US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]], selling over 957,000 copies in the first week of sales. It has since sold over 2.7 million copies in the United States and been certified [[RIAA certification|double platinum]] by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA). Five accompanying singles were released, including the international hits \"[[Stronger (Kanye West song)|Stronger]]\", \"[[Good Life (Kanye West song)|Good Life]]\" and \"[[Homecoming (Kanye West song)|Homecoming]]\", the former of which topped the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]. The album received widely positive reviews from [[Music journalism|music critics]], with several of them praising the production, and earned West his third [[Grammy Award for Best Rap Album]], as well as his third nomination for [[Grammy Award for Album of the Year|Album of the Year]]. It was named as one the best albums of 2007 by multiple publications, including ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' and ''[[USA Today]]'', while also listed among numerous decade-end lists.\n\nThe coinciding release dates between ''Graduation'' and rapper [[50 Cent]]'s ''[[Curtis (50 Cent album)|Curtis]]'' generated much publicity over the idea of a sales competition, resulting in record-breaking sales performances by both albums. The success of the former and the outcome of its competition with the latter marked the end of the dominance of [[gangsta rap]] in mainstream hip-hop. This is credited with paving the way for other hip-hop artists who did not conform to gangster conventions to find commercial acceptance.\n\n== Background ==\n''Graduation'' is the third installment of West's planned [[tetralogy]] of education-themed studio albums, which West subsequently later deviated from due to the events surrounding the conception of his fourth studio album, ''[[808s & Heartbreak]]'' (2008).<ref name=\"Patel\">{{cite web | last=Patel | first=Joseph | title=Producer Kanye West's Debut LP Features Jay-Z, ODB, Mos Def | url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1472302/20030604/index.jhtml?headlines=true | date=2003-06-05 | publisher=[[MTV]] [[Viacom (2005\u2013present)|Viacom]] | accessdate=2009-04-21 | url-status=live | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090504171249/http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1472302/20030604/index.jhtml?headlines=true | archivedate=2009-05-04 }}</ref> The album demonstrates yet another distinctive progression in West's musical style and approach to [[Record production|production]].

The majority of song is composed of repetitive recitations of its choruses and bridges by Mos Def and Al Be Back. West melodically raps only one single verse in which he nostalgically reminisces over taking trips to the museum with his grandparents. As his verse draws to a close, West chastises that a person can't dwell on the past, and charges himself with living his life like he has no tomorrow. In retrospect, with the death of his mother [[Donda West]] less than two months after the album was released in addition to the dissolution of his engagement with fianc\u00e9e Alexis Phifer, the trace

It was formed from parts of [[Ramsey County, Minnesota|Ramsey County]] and [[Benton County, Minnesota|Benton County]]; the [[Rum River]] previously divided the line between the two counties. The boundaries were mainly the same as they are now, except for a small part of the southeastern tip along the [[Mississippi River]] and at the south, formerly known as [[Manomin County, Minnesota|Manomin County]]. It was a small portion that connected to Ramsey and occupied one-third of the congressional township. It was then attached to Anoka County by constitutional amendment November 2, 1869. It became known as Fridley in 1879.\n\nThe first white men to explore what is now Anoka County were the Franciscan friar [[Louis Hennepin]] and his party. Fur traders soon began to settle in the area which is now Ramsey County. They settled on the Rum River and more people were attracted to the area. A community was created which is now called Anoka.\n\n==Geography==\nThe [[Mississippi River]] flows southeasterly along the county's southwestern boundary. The [[Rum River]] flows southerly through the western part of the county, discharging into the Mississippi at the county's southwestern boundary. The terrain consists of low rolling wooded hills.<ref name=ACM>[https://www.google.com/maps/place/Anoka+County,+MN/@45.2252377,-93.4056133,11z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x52b34488c065fdbf:0xc2263f30aade47b3!8m2!3d45.3292832!4d-93.2197005 ''Anoka County MN'' Google Maps (accessed 4 March 2019)]</ref> The terrain slopes to the south and east; its highest point is a small hillock 1.2 mile (1.9&nbsp;km) east of the county's northwest corner, at 1,100' (335m) ASL.<ref>[https://www.peakbagger.com/peak.aspx?pid=18370 Anoka County High Point, Minnesota.

It was formed from parts of [[Ramsey County, Minnesota|Ramsey County]] and [[Benton County, Minnesota|Benton County]]; the [[Rum River]] previously divided the line between the two counties. The boundaries were mainly the same as they are now, except for a small part of the southeastern tip along the [[Mississippi River]] and at the south, formerly known as [[Manomin County, Minnesota|Manomin County]]. It was a small portion that connected to Ramsey and occupied one-third of the congressional township. It was then attached to Anoka County by constitutional amendment November 2, 1869. It became known as Fridley in 1879.\n\nThe first white men to explore what is now Anoka County were the Franciscan friar [[Louis Hennepin]] and his party. Fur traders soon began to settle in the area which is now Ramsey County. They settled on the Rum River and more people were attracted to the area. A community was created which is now called Anoka.\n\n==Geography==\nThe [[Mississippi River]] flows southeasterly along the county's southwestern boundary.
