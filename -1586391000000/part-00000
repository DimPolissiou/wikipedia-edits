So, anecdotal evidence involves all your subjectivity\u2014if we do it like this we don't have that anymore.

I've never believed in ghosts or psychics or anything like that 'cause it's quite simple\u2014you don't have to know much to go, \"''Really''?\" Or, to just apply [[Occam's Razor]], to go, \"Is it more likely that souls do circus tricks, or more likely that they're talking to dead people? And if the latter, by what process? What do you mean talking to dead people? Aren't their voice boxes rotten?

Minchin states that there is very little harm in something like [[reiki]], but asks \"where do you draw the line?\" when it comes to needing real evidence if a therapy works or not.

All I'm doing is making things consumable that are otherwise difficult to consume.\"<ref name=\"SkepticZone26\">{{cite podcast |title=The Skeptic Zone #26 |date=2009-04-17 |website=skepticzone.tv |url=http://skepticzone.libsyn.com/the_skeptic_zone_26_17_april_2009 |accessdate=2014-06-06 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151220144036/http://ec.libsyn.com/p/9/6/9/969ee23bc7d9ba91/the_skeptic_zone_26_090417.mp3?d13a76d516d9dec20c3d276ce028ed5089ab1ce3dae902ea1d06cd8731d3c05c4a83&c_id=1882109 |archive-date=2015-12-20 |url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nAs the son and grandson of medical surgeons, Minchin addressed \"alternative medicine\" claims by relating that unbiased tests for efficacy are the key:\n<blockquote>\nYou're in such a strong position when you understand the scientific process because all you say is, \"Do you understand that the great breakthrough of humanity was figuring out how to make decisions about things whilst discarding human foibles? So, anecdotal evidence involves all your subjectivity\u2014if we do it like this we don't have that anymore. Why, surely do you understand how ''powerful'' that is?\" And if they don't, then that's what you have to explain to them. It's an extremely powerful thing and a very basic thing.<ref name=\"SkepticZone26\" /></blockquote>\n\nMinchin further explained his [[Skepticism|skeptical]] outlook:\n<blockquote>\nI've always been an atheist; I've always been an empiricist really. I've never believed in ghosts or psychics or anything like that 'cause it's quite simple\u2014you don't have to know much to go, \"''Really''?\" Or, to just apply [[Occam's Razor]], to go, \"Is it more likely that souls do circus tricks, or more likely that they're talking to dead people? And if the latter, by what process? What do you mean talking to dead people? Aren't their voice boxes rotten? So without a voice box, how do they talk, and by what means?\" It doesn't take much to be skeptical about that. But really understanding, as I'm still learning, why science is powerful, is a new step towards being boring at dinner parties.<ref name=\"SkepticZone26\" /></blockquote>\n\nWhen asked if he thought the universe is full of life, Minchin summarised: \"The chances of this happening might be one in infinity. Put it this way: the chance that there being intelligent alien life are, for me, infinitely higher than the chance there being a creator god.\"<ref name=\"SkepticZone26\" />\n\nIn an interview with [[Independent Investigations Group]] member John Rael, Minchin explains that what upsets him most about paranormal beliefs is \"[[special pleading]]\" by people who say vague things such as \"there is no harm in it\". Minchin states that there is very little harm in something like [[reiki]], but asks \"where do you draw the line?\" when it comes to needing real evidence if a therapy works or not. He states that he is an atheist as well as a skeptic, and cannot understand how someone can be a skeptic and still be religious. \"If you apply doubt to anything...the whole religion thing is obviously a fantasy.\"<ref>{{cite interview |interviewer=John Rael |subject=Tim Minchin |title=Be Skeptical, episode #1 |date=10 July 2011 |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YGbsQkeMsA |accessdate=10 July 2011 }}</ref>\n\nIn 2012, Minchin appeared in a video hosted on the homepage of the British Humanist Association, describing Humanism as important \"because having a non-superstitious worldview allows you to go about your own business, making ethical decisions based on a general desire to do the most possible good.\"<ref name=\"humanistvideo\">{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=49&v=DZN8Ne1nmr4 |title=Humanism Intro Part 1 |last= |first= |date=30 July 2012 |publisher=[[British Humanist Association]] |access-date=12 November 2016 |quote=}}</ref>\n\n===Alternative medicine===\nMinchin has set to verse a [[Alternative medicine#Criticism.2C legitimacy and effects|scientific-skeptical definition]] of [[alternative medicine]]:\n\n{{quote|\"By definition\", I begin<br />\"Alternative Medicine\", I continue<br />\"Has either not been proved to work,<br />Or been proved not to work.<br />You know what they call \"alternative medicine\"<br />That\u2019s been proved to work?<br />Medicine.\"|Tim Minchin, ''Storm''<ref name=\"stormmovie\"/>}}\n\n==Protest songs==\n===\"Come Home (Cardinal Pell)\"===\nIn 2016, during the course of Australia's [[Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse]] Minchin wrote \"Come Home (Cardinal Pell)\", which criticized Cardinal [[George Pell]].

These naturally-occurring ores typically included arsenic as a common impurity. Copper/tin ores are rare, as reflected in the fact that there were no tin bronzes in [[western Asia]] before 3000 BC. In some parts of the world, a [[Copper Age]] follows the [[Neolithic]] and precedes the Bronze Age.\n\nThe [[Iron Age]] was the stage in the development of any people in which tools and weapons whose main ingredient was iron were prominent. The adoption of this material coincided with other changes in some past societies often including differing agricultural practices, religious beliefs and artistic styles, although this was not always the case.\n\n<!-- Do not add any earlier times to this list.

The transition period from Classical Antiquity to the [[Early Middle Ages]] is known as [[Late Antiquity]]. Late Antiquity is a periodization used by historians to describe the transitional centuries from Classical Antiquity to the Middle Ages, in both mainland Europe and the Mediterranean world: generally from the end of the Roman Empire's Crisis of the Third Century (c. AD 284) to the Islamic conquests and the re-organization of the [[Byzantine Empire]] under [[Heraclius]]. The [[Early Middle Ages]] are a period in the history of [[Europe]] following the fall of the [[Western Roman Empire]] spanning roughly five centuries from AD 500 to 1000. Not all historians agree on the ending dates of ancient history, which frequently falls somewhere in the 5th, 6th, or 7th century. [[Western culture|Western]] scholars usually date the end of ancient history with the [[fall of the Western Roman Empire|fall of Rome]] in AD 476, the death of the emperor [[Justinian I]] in AD 565, or the [[coming of Islam]] in AD 632 as the end of [[Classical Antiquity|ancient European history]].\n\n{{For|later events|Timeline of the Middle Ages}}\n\n==Maps==\n<gallery widths=\"200px\" heights=\"200px\" perrow=\"3\">\nImage:East-Hem 500bc.jpg|Eastern Hemisphere in 500 BC.\nImage:East-Hem 323bc.jpg|Eastern Hemisphere in 323 BC.\nImage:East-Hem 200bc.jpg|Eastern Hemisphere in 200 BC.\nImage:East-Hem 100bc.jpg|Eastern Hemisphere in 100 BC.\nImage:World in 1 CE.png|World in AD 1.\nImage:World in 100 CE.PNG|World in AD 100.\nImage:East-Hem 200ad.jpg|Eastern Hemisphere in AD 200.\nImage:World in 300 CE.PNG|World in AD 300.\nImage:East-Hem 475ad.jpg|Eastern Hemisphere in AD 476.\n</gallery>\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of ancient dishes|List of ancient dishes and foods]]\n*[[Timeline of the Middle Ages]]\n*[[Timelines of modern history]]\n\n==References==\n\n* {{cite book |last= Carr |first=E.

These naturally-occurring ores typically included arsenic as a common impurity. Copper/tin ores are rare, as reflected in the fact that there were no tin bronzes in [[western Asia]] before 3000 BC. In some parts of the world, a [[Copper Age]] follows the [[Neolithic]] and precedes the Bronze Age.\n\nThe [[Iron Age]] was the stage in the development of any people in which tools and weapons whose main ingredient was iron were prominent. The adoption of this material coincided with other changes in some past societies often including differing agricultural practices, religious beliefs and artistic styles, although this was not always the case.\n\n<!-- Do not add any earlier times to this list.

The succeeding empire: Byzantine, was an extension until 1453 AD.\n\n==End of ancient history in Europe==\nThe date used as the end of the ancient era is arbitrary. The transition period from Classical Antiquity to the [[Early Middle Ages]] is known as [[Late Antiquity]]. Late Antiquity is a periodization used by historians to describe the transitional centuries from Classical Antiquity to the Middle Ages, in both mainland Europe and the Mediterranean world: generally from the end of the Roman Empire's Crisis of the Third Century (c. AD 284) to the Islamic conquests and the re-organization of the [[Byzantine Empire]] under [[Heraclius]]. The [[Early Middle Ages]] are a period in the history of [[Europe]] following the fall of the [[Western Roman Empire]] spanning roughly five centuries from AD 500 to 1000. Not all historians agree on the ending dates of ancient history, which frequently falls somewhere in the 5th, 6th, or 7th century. [[Western culture|Western]] scholars usually date the end of ancient history with the [[fall of the Western Roman Empire|fall of Rome]] in AD 476, the death of the emperor [[Justinian I]] in AD 565, or the [[coming of Islam]] in AD 632 as the end of [[Classical Antiquity|ancient European history]].\n\n{{For|later events|Timeline of the Middle Ages}}\n\n==Maps==\n<gallery widths=\"200px\" heights=\"200px\" perrow=\"3\">\nImage:East-Hem 500bc.jpg|Eastern Hemisphere in 500 BC.\nImage:East-Hem 323bc.jpg|Eastern Hemisphere in 323 BC.\nImage:East-Hem 200bc.jpg|Eastern Hemisphere in 200 BC.\nImage:East-Hem 100bc.jpg|Eastern Hemisphere in 100 BC.\nImage:World in 1 CE.png|World in AD 1.\nImage:World in 100 CE.PNG|World in AD 100.\nImage:East-Hem 200ad.jpg|Eastern Hemisphere in AD 200.\nImage:World in 300 CE.PNG|World in AD 300.\nImage:East-Hem 475ad.jpg|Eastern Hemisphere in AD 476.\n</gallery>\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of ancient dishes|List of ancient dishes and foods]]\n*[[Timeline of the Middle Ages]]\n*[[Timelines of modern history]]\n\n==References==\n\n* {{cite book |last= Carr |first=E.

One Sports supplies and airs major sporting events in the [[Philippines]] and the world for free-to-air TV channels [[5 (TV channel)|5]], [[One Sports (TV channel)|One Sports channel]] and [[Cignal]]-exclusive channels [[One Sports (TV channel)|One Sports+]] and [[PBA Rush]].\n\nIts flagship program is [[Philippine Basketball Association]], the world's second oldest professional [[basketball]] league, since it acquired the television rights from 2004 to 2008 and again from 2011 until now.\n\n==History==\n\n===ABC Sports===\nThe network's sports division, then known as ABC Sports, was established in 2004 as a result of ABC-5's acquisition of broadcast rights to the [[Philippine Basketball Association]]. The telecasts were known as the ''PBA on ABC'', after the disbandment of the [[PBA on NBN/IBC|broadcasting consortium]] between [[People's Television Network|NBN-4]] and [[Intercontinental Broadcasting Corporation|IBC-13]]. Aside from PBA, ABC Sports also broadcast volleyball games and local boxing bouts, as well as [[NBA]] basketball and [[WWE|WWE wrestling matches]] (in partnership with [[Solar Entertainment]]). But after ABC rebranded to TV5 in August 2008, the network still managed to cover the [[2008 PBA Fiesta Conference Finals]], though it is under the auspices of ABC's blocktimer [[Media Prima Berhad|MPB Primedia, Inc.]] After which, broadcast rights for PBA, NBA, and WWE were then moved to [[Solar Sports]] and [[Radio Philippines Network|RPN-9]] starting in the 2008\u201309 season.\n\n===TV5 Sports===\nIn 2009, ABC Sports, still under management of MPB Primedia, was renamed as TV5 Sports in the interim (does not identify as such), in which the network acquired broadcasting rights to the [[ASEAN Basketball League]] (the Philippine team in the league, [[AirAsia Philippine Patriots]], was by-then managed by ABC/TV5 owner Antonio \"Tonyboy\" Cojuangco, Jr.), U.S. boxing matches, and others.\nIn 2010, ABL's broadcasting contract with TV5 expired, after TV5 was acquired by [[MediaQuest Holdings]], and was moved to IBC-13 and later, [[ABS-CBN Sports and Action]].\n\n===Sports5===\nIn 2011, [[5 (TV channel)|TV5]] and [[Intercontinental Broadcasting Corporation|IBC]], inked a blocktime deal which subsequently became [[AKTV]]. It was launched on May 5, 2011 through a marathon held at the Mall Of Asia Grounds in Pasay City.\n\nFrom then on, Sports5 obtained rights to air major sporting leagues and events like the [[Philippine Basketball Association]], [[United Football League (Philippines)|United Football League]] and the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association (Philippines)|NCAA]] (returned to [[ABS-CBN Sports]] in 2015).\n\nUntil its flagship primetime sports block's closure in 2013 due to high blocktime costs and poor ratings, most of its programs are aired on IBC through its programming block AKTV. From June 2013 onwards, most of its sports coverages are shown on [[5 (TV channel)|TV5]], [[AksyonTV]] and [[Hyper (TV channel)|Hyper]]. It is headquartered at [[TV5 Media Center]], Reliance cor. Sheridan st., [[Mandaluyong City]].\n\nSports5 is the official TV partner of the Olympic Games in the Philippines from 2014 to 2016. In 2016, Sports5 acquired the Philippine broadcast rights (from [[ABS-CBN Sports]]) to air [[Ultimate Fighting Championship]] (UFC) on free TV and satellite.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.spin.ph/combat-sports/news/ufc-on-sports5-cignal-abs-cbn-balls-skycable-destiny-cable|title=TV5 gets rights to air UFC fights as Balls Channel announces it is going off the air|publisher=Spin.ph|date=21 December 2015|accessdate=21 December 2015}}</ref>\n\n===ESPN5===\nOn October 12, 2017, TV5 announced that it had reached a partnership with [[ESPN International]] to re-brand Sports 5 as '''ESPN5'''; the re-branding took effect the next day, coinciding with game 1 of the [[2017 PBA Governors' Cup|PBA Governors' Cup]] final. As part of the relationship, the channel acquired domestic rights to some of [[ESPN]]'s U.S. and international programming, including [[Boxing on ESPN|boxing]], [[IndyCar Series]], the [[NFL]], U.S. college sports, and the [[X Games]]. Although ESPN is a U.S. NBA broadcaster, the league has a separate rights deal with ABS-CBN. The operation includes a local version of ESPN's flagship studio program ''[[SportsCenter]]'', ''SportsCenter Philippines'' (which premiered on December 17, 2017), and collaboration between ESPN and TV5 on digital content\u2014having launched a localized version of [[ESPN.com]] and the streaming ESPN Player service on January 31, 2018.

The partnership continues online, however, as the ESPN5 webpage is still active and serves as the de-facto One Sports homepage in the Philippines. At the same day, [[5 Plus]] was relaunched as a [[One Sports (TV channel)|dedicated channel of One Sports]] which was moved from being an exclusive-pay television channel to free-to-air and eventually taking over its channel space.

From June 2013 onwards, most of its sports coverages are shown on [[5 (TV channel)|TV5]], [[AksyonTV]] and [[Hyper (TV channel)|Hyper]]. It is headquartered at [[TV5 Media Center]], Reliance cor. Sheridan st., [[Mandaluyong City]].\n\nSports5 is the official TV partner of the Olympic Games in the Philippines from 2014 to 2016. In 2016, Sports5 acquired the Philippine broadcast rights (from [[ABS-CBN Sports]]) to air [[Ultimate Fighting Championship]] (UFC) on free TV and satellite.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.spin.ph/combat-sports/news/ufc-on-sports5-cignal-abs-cbn-balls-skycable-destiny-cable|title=TV5 gets rights to air UFC fights as Balls Channel announces it is going off the air|publisher=Spin.ph|date=21 December 2015|accessdate=21 December 2015}}</ref>\n\n===ESPN5===\nOn October 12, 2017, TV5 announced that it had reached a partnership with [[ESPN International]] to re-brand Sports 5 as '''ESPN5'''; the re-branding took effect the next day, coinciding with game 1 of the [[2017 PBA Governors' Cup|PBA Governors' Cup]] final. As part of the relationship, the channel acquired domestic rights to some of [[ESPN]]'s U.S. and international programming, including [[Boxing on ESPN|boxing]], [[IndyCar Series]], the [[NFL]], U.S. college sports, and the [[X Games]]. Although ESPN is a U.S. NBA broadcaster, the league has a separate rights deal with ABS-CBN. The operation includes a local version of ESPN's flagship studio program ''[[SportsCenter]]'', ''SportsCenter Philippines'' (which premiered on December 17, 2017), and collaboration between ESPN and TV5 on digital content\u2014having launched a localized version of [[ESPN.com]] and the streaming ESPN Player service on January 31, 2018. The partnership marked the return of the ESPN brand to the country since the replacement of [[ESPN Philippines]] with [[Fox Sports Asia]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.interaksyon.com/espn-5-is-here-tv5-announces-partnership-with-worldwide-leader-in-sports/|title=ESPN-5 IS HERE - TV5 announces partnership with \u2018Worldwide Leader in Sports\u2019|publisher=Interaksyon|last=Bolante|first=Mikkel|date=October 12, 2017|accessdate=October 12, 2017}}</ref><ref name=\"ESPN 5\">{{cite press release|url=http://espnmediazone.com/us/press-releases/2017/10/tv-5-espn-collaborate-launch-espn-5-philippines/|title=TV 5 AND ESPN COLLABORATE TO LAUNCH ESPN 5 IN THE PHILIPPINES|publisher=ESPN|last=Melvin|first=Paul|date=October 11, 2017|accessdate=October 12, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.rappler.com/sports/by-sport/other-sports/185056-espn-returns-philippine-tv|title=ESPN returns to Philippine TV with TV5 partnership|publisher=[[Rappler]]|last=Isaga|first=JP|date=October 12, 2017|accessdate=October 12, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://technology.mb.com.ph/2018/01/31/370073/|title=ESPN launches New Digital Gateway with the Philippines Edition of ESPN.com and ESPN Player|publisher=[[Manila Bulletin]]|date=January 31, 2018|accessdate=January 31, 2018}}</ref>\n\n===One Sports===\nOn March 8, 2020, ESPN5 ceased to exist on television and was rebranded as One Sports (named after the then pay television channel of the same name), as both [[5 (TV channel)|5]] and the new One Sports channel decided to not carry any ESPN5-branded programming on its schedule. The partnership continues online, however, as the ESPN5 webpage is still active and serves as the de-facto ESPN and One Sports homepage in the Philippines.
