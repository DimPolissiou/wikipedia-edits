Jonah learns that Ruth was a major part of the Hunters, having built their extensive archive of historical files and more recent interviews. FBI agent Millie, investigating the death of the scientist, starts to uncover the Nazi links. Travis, a deadly American born Nazi working for The Colonel, who is leading the Nazi underground, is sent to Florida to learn who is killing their members.

Jonah begins a search for Wilhelm \"The Wolf\" Zuchs, the Nazi doctor who tortured Meyer and Ruth thirty years before. From clues, Jonah discovers Ruth's files which lead him to capture a surgeon he believes to be the Wolf who Meyer executes. However, Meyer doesn't recite a prayer he'd sworn to Ruth he would if he ever caught up to the Wolf, leading a horrified Jonah to put the pieces together and realize that Meyer is actually the Wolf. Zuchs confesses, explaining that he had killed the real Meyer to take his identity and escape the Soviets while later undergoing [[plastic surgery]] (from the SS surgeon he just now killed) to complete the transformation. Having lived a Jewish life for thirty years, Zuchs insists that he regrets his actions and that a visit by Ruth a year before inspired him to bring the Hunters together as penance. Despite a vision of Ruth attempting to talk him down, Jonah kills Zuchs and reveals the truth to the other horrified Hunters. Harriet, after having consulted with an unidentified woman, suggests to the remaining Hunters that they continue their mission in Europe. Mizushima is kidnapped and taken to [[National Reorganization Process|Argentina]], where he discovers that The Colonel is alive, her identity is [[Eva Braun]] and she is living with [[Adolf Hitler]] and four identical Aryan-looking boys.\n |LineColor       = #F4CA16\n}}\n}}\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\nOn May 17, 2018, it was announced that [[Amazon Video]] had given the production a straight-to-series order for a first season consisting of ten episodes.

Jonah learns that Ruth was a major part of the Hunters, having built their extensive archive of historical files and more recent interviews. FBI agent Millie, investigating the death of the scientist, starts to uncover the Nazi links. Travis, a deadly American born Nazi working for The Colonel, who is leading the Nazi underground, is sent to Florida to learn who is killing their members.

Jonah begins a search for Wilhelm \"The Wolf\" Zuchs, the Nazi doctor who tortured Meyer and Ruth thirty years before. From clues, Jonah discovers Ruth's files which lead him to capture a surgeon he believes to be the Wolf who Meyer executes. However, Meyer doesn't recite a prayer he'd sworn to Ruth he would if he ever caught up to the Wolf, leading a horrified Jonah to put the pieces together and realize that Meyer is actually the Wolf. Zuchs confesses, explaining that he had killed the real Meyer to take his identity and escape the Soviets while later undergoing [[plastic surgery]] (from the SS surgeon he just now killed) to complete the transformation. Having lived a Jewish life for thirty years, Zuchs insists that he regrets his actions and that a visit by Ruth a year before inspired him to bring the Hunters together as penance. Despite a vision of Ruth attempting to talk him down, Jonah kills Zuchs and reveals the truth to the other horrified Hunters. Harriet, after having consulted with an unidentified woman, suggests to the remaining Hunters that they continue their mission in Europe. Mizushima is kidnapped and taken to [[National Reorganization Process|Argentina]], where he discovers that The Colonel is alive, her identity is [[Eva Braun]] and she is living with [[Adolf Hitler]] and four identical Aryan-looking boys.\n |LineColor       = #F4CA16\n}}\n}}\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\nOn May 17, 2018, it was announced that [[Amazon Video]] had given the production a straight-to-series order for a first season consisting of ten episodes.

Epidemic control is executed both by the federal authorities such as Robert Koch Institute and by the German states. The German states have their own epidemic plans. In early March, the national plan was extended for the handling of the ongoing coronavirus pandemic.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.rki.de/DE/Content/InfAZ/N/Neuartiges_Coronavirus/Ergaenzung_Pandemieplan_Covid.pdf |title=Erg\u00e4nzung zum Nationalen Pandemieplan \u2013 COVID-19 \u2013 neuartige Coronaviruserkrankung |last=[[Robert Koch-Institut]] |date=4 March 2020 |language=de |access-date=2 March 2020}}</ref> Four major targets are included in this plan:\n\n* Reduce morbidity and mortality\n* Ensure treatment of infected persons\n* Upkeep of essential public services\n* Short and accurate information for decision-makers, media and public\n\nThe plan has three stages which might eventually overlap:\n* Containment (circumstances of dedicated cases and clusters)\n* Protection (circumstances of further spreading infections and unknown sources of infections)\n* Mitigation (circumstances of widespread infections)\n\nIn the ''containment stage'' health authorities are focusing on identifying contact persons who are put in personal quarantine and are monitored and tested. Personal quarantine is overseen by the local health agencies. By doing so, authorities are trying to keep infection chains short, leading to curtailed clusters. In the ''protection stage'' the strategy will change to using direct measures to protect vulnerable persons from becoming infected. The ''mitigation stage'' will eventually try to avoid spikes of intensive treatment in order to maintain medical services.\n\n===Criticism===\nAs early as January 2013, the German [[Bundestag]] was fully informed about the dangers of the global spread of a coronavirus pandemic. A risk analysis predicted how dangerous a global coronavirus outbreak could be. It stated that \"children [\u2026] have [\u2026] minor disease progressions\" and that the risk of death of \"over-65-year-olds [is] at 50%\". It furthermore stated that a \"vaccine\" is \"unavailable\", so all the more important is the \"use of protective equipment such as protective masks, goggles and gloves\". The {{ill|Federal Office of Civil Protection and Disaster Assistance|de|Bundesamt f\u00fcr Bev\u00f6lkerungsschutz und Katastrophenhilfe}} (BBK) never set up appropriate stores or had talks with manufacturers and suppliers to prepare for such a situation.<ref name=\"frontal\">{{Cite news |title=Vers\u00e4umte Pandemie-Vorsorge |date=24 March 2020 |work=ZDF Frontal 21 |language=de |author-first1=Andreas |author-last1=Halbach |author-first2=Thomas |author-last2=M\u00fcnten |author-first3=Heiko |author-last3=Rahms}}</ref>\n\n==Statistics==\n=== Robert Koch Institute ===\nThe [[Robert Koch Institute]] (RKI) lists current numbers of registered cases in Germany and other countries online.

Starting 10 March 2020, due to continuously rising case numbers, RKI stopped manually updating the numbers and switched to adopting the numbers that were electronically transmitted. New numbers were published once a day in the afternoon.

Regional health departments initially reported data to the state health department which transferred data to the federal health department, many but not all on the day of receiving them. Reporting switched from manual to electronic. The Robert Koch Institute releases official numbers with an additional delay of several days. Cases reported by federal health departments are added earlier to a project by [[Funke Mediengruppe]], to which [[Berliner Morgenpost]] belongs.

Personal quarantine is overseen by the local health agencies. By doing so, authorities are trying to keep infection chains short, leading to curtailed clusters. In the ''protection stage'' the strategy will change to using direct measures to protect vulnerable persons from becoming infected. The ''mitigation stage'' will eventually try to avoid spikes of intensive treatment in order to maintain medical services.\n\n===Criticism===\nAs early as January 2013, the German [[Bundestag]] was fully informed about the dangers of the global spread of a coronavirus pandemic.

It stated that \"children [\u2026] have [\u2026] minor disease progressions\" and that the risk of death of \"over-65-year-olds [is] at 50%\". It furthermore stated that a \"vaccine\" is \"unavailable\", so all the more important is the \"use of protective equipment such as protective masks, goggles and gloves\". The {{ill|Federal Office of Civil Protection and Disaster Assistance|de|Bundesamt f\u00fcr Bev\u00f6lkerungsschutz und Katastrophenhilfe}} (BBK) never set up appropriate stores or had talks with manufacturers and suppliers to prepare for such a situation.<ref name=\"frontal\">{{Cite news |title=Vers\u00e4umte Pandemie-Vorsorge |date=24 March 2020 |work=ZDF Frontal 21 |language=de |author-first1=Andreas |author-last1=Halbach |author-first2=Thomas |author-last2=M\u00fcnten |author-first3=Heiko |author-last3=Rahms}}</ref>\n\n==Statistics==\n=== Robert Koch Institute ===\nThe [[Robert Koch Institute]] (RKI) lists current numbers of registered cases in Germany and other countries online.

Regional health departments initially reported data to the state health department which transferred data to the federal health department, many but not all on the day of receiving them. Reporting switched from manual to electronic. The Robert Koch Institute releases official numbers with an additional delay of several days. Cases reported by federal health departments are added earlier to a project by [[Funke Mediengruppe]], to which [[Berliner Morgenpost]] belongs. [[Johns Hopkins University]] seems to use the numbers of the Funke project for Germany indirectly while the Funke project uses numbers of Johns Hopkins University for other countries.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.welt.de/vermischtes/article206783949/Coronavirus-RKI-rechtfertigt-sich-und-haelt-sich-dann-konsequent-zurueck.html |title=RKI rechtfertigt sich \u2013 und h\u00e4lt sich bei einer Frage konsequent zur\u00fcck |date=25 March 2020 |access-date=25 March 2020 |work=Die Welt |ref=WELT2503}}</ref>\n\nAs of March 25, the number of unknown cases was thought to be up to tenfold higher.

However, he then told Fine that his small size made it unlikely that he would ever play at a [[NCAA Division I Football Bowl Subdivision|Division I FBS]] school, instead offering to recommend him to [[NCAA Division I#Football Championship Subdivision|Division I FCS]] or [[NCAA Division II|Division II]] schools.

Shortly after his hiring, Littrell called Hennesy to ask about available quarterbacks; while North Texas had an incoming graduate transfer from [[Alabama Crimson Tide football|Alabama]] for the 2016 season, Littrell sought a future prospect.

According to a 2020 story by [[Yahoo Sports]] journalist Jeff Eisenberg, Fine's development as a quarterback began in the summer before his sixth-grade year, during which he attended a quarterback camp at the [[Oklahoma Sooners football|University of Oklahoma]]. The young Fine paid special attention to former Oklahoma star quarterback and then-current Sooners assistant [[Josh Heupel]], observing Heupel's throwing motion and paying attention to the advice he offered. During each day's drive home from the camp, he wrote down what he had learned. After the camp, Fine and his father typed up the notes, and he went so far as to place a printed copy next to his bed.<ref name=Eisenberg>{{cite web|url=https://www.yahoo.com/sports/too-short-mason-fine-is-just-fine-proving-doubters-wrong-130958631.html |title=Too short?

The film was co-written, directed, and produced by series creator [[Stephen Hillenburg]], with live-action sequences directed by [[Mark Osborne (filmmaker)|Mark Osborne]]. It features the series' cast of [[Tom Kenny]], [[Bill Fagerbakke]], [[Clancy Brown]], [[Rodger Bumpass]] and [[Mr. Lawrence]], and also has new actors which include [[Alec Baldwin]], [[David Hasselhoff]] (as himself), [[Scarlett Johansson]] and [[Jeffrey Tambor]]. It is the first film in the ''[[List of SpongeBob SquarePants films|SpongeBob SquarePants]]'' film series. In this film, [[Plankton (character)|Plankton]] devises a plan to discredit his business nemesis [[Mr. Krabs]], steal the [[Krabby Patty]] secret formula and take over the world by stealing [[Neptune (mythology)|King Neptune]]'s crown and framing Mr. Krabs for the crime. [[SpongeBob SquarePants (character)|SpongeBob]] and [[Patrick Star|Patrick]] team up to retrieve the crown from Shell City to save Mr. Krabs from Neptune's wrath and the oceanic world from Plankton's rule.\n\nPrevious offers by [[Paramount Pictures]] for a film adaptation of ''SpongeBob SquarePants'' had been rejected by Stephen Hillenburg, but he eventually accepted one offer in 2002. A writing team consisting of Hillenburg, [[Paul Tibbitt]], [[Derek Drymon]], [[Aaron Springer]], [[Kent Osborne]] and [[Tim Hill (director)|Tim Hill]] was assembled, conceiving the idea of a mythical hero's quest and the search for a stolen crown, which would bring SpongeBob and Patrick to the surface. The film was originally intended as the [[series finale]], but Nickelodeon ordered more episodes of the series as it had become increasingly profitable, so Hillenburg resigned as showrunner with Tibbitt taking his place.\n\nThe film was widely promoted by Paramount and Nickelodeon, with tie-in promotions made by [[7-Eleven]], the [[Cayman Islands]] and [[Burger King]], which decorated various of its franchises with {{convert|9|ft|adj=on}} SpongeBob inflatable figures. The film was released on November 19, 2004, grossing $140 million worldwide,<ref name=\"BOM\" /> and received generally positive reviews from critics. A second film titled ''[[The SpongeBob Movie: Sponge Out of Water]]'' was released on February 6, 2015, and another titled ''[[The SpongeBob Movie: Sponge on the Run]]'' is scheduled for release on August 7, 2020.\n\n==Plot==\n<!--Please keep the plot brief and concise. DO NOT ADD EVERY DETAIL.-->\nA band of [[Piracy|pirates]] discover a treasure chest full of movie tickets to see <nowiki>''The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie.'' All of the pirates cheer and sing ''</nowiki>[[SpongeBob SquarePants theme|the SpongeBob theme song]]<nowiki>''</nowiki> as they head to the movie theater to see the motion picture.\n\nThe movie begins when [[SpongeBob SquarePants (character)|SpongeBob SquarePants]] gets a dream of himself imitating in an action film when he wakes up, cheerfully prepares for the opening ceremony for a second [[Krusty Krab]], expecting his boss [[Mr. Krabs]] to promote him as new manager of the new restaurant. Instead, Mr. Krabs names [[Squidward Tentacles]], SpongeBob\u2019s next-door neighbor and co-worker, as manager, thinking SpongeBob is too immature to handle the role, much to SpongeBob's depression. Meanwhile, Mr. Krabs' business rival, [[Plankton and Karen#Plankton|Plankton]], complains about his failures to his computer wife [[Plankton and Karen#Karen|Karen]], being unable to steal the Krabby Patty formula. When Karen points out plan \"Z\", a scheme which he has yet to attempt, Plankton decides to implement it.\n\nThat night, SpongeBob drowns his sorrows in ice cream with his best friend [[Patrick Star]]. Elsewhere, Plankton steals [[List of SpongeBob SquarePants characters#Supporting characters|King Neptune]]'s crown, leaving false evidence to frame Mr. Krabs for the crime, and sends the crown to the distant land of Shell City. The next morning, Neptune barges into the Krusty Krab 2 and threatens Mr. Krabs for his alleged thievery. SpongeBob arrives and chastises Mr. Krabs under the influence of an ice-cream headache, but seeing his boss's life at risk shocks SpongeBob back to his senses and he promises Neptune that he will retrieve the crown from Shell City. Neptune is convinced by his daughter Mindy to spare Mr. Krabs for the time being and freezes him instead, ordering SpongeBob to return with the crown in exactly six days. Soon after SpongeBob and Patrick leave for Shell City, Plankton steals the Krabby Patty formula and uses it to produce and sell Krabby Patties at his restaurant, the Chum Bucket. He also gives away free Chum Bucket helmets to his customers, which are actually mind-controlling devices that Plankton activates to control Bikini Bottom's residents and take over the city. Squidward goes to the Chum Bucket to confront Plankton, but is captured and enslaved by the customers.\n\nAfter overcoming several setbacks on their journey, including sacrificing the Patty Wagon to escape a ravenous [[frogfish]], SpongeBob and Patrick reach a dangerous, monster-filled trench. When they finally come to the conclusion that they cannot finish the mission due to their immaturity, they tearfully give up. Mindy arrives at the trench and tells SpongeBob and Patrick about Plankton's plan. She pretends to magically turn them into men by giving them seaweed mustaches. With their confidence boosted, they brave the trench but are confronted by Dennis, a hitman hired by Plankton to eliminate them. Suddenly, Dennis is stepped on by a hard-hat diver that SpongeBob and Patrick believe to be a [[Cyclops]]. The Cyclops grabs SpongeBob and Patrick, and takes them to his beachside store, revealed to be Shell City.\n\nIn the store, SpongeBob and Patrick find the crown, but die when they are dehydrated by the Cyclops' heat lamp. Their tears short-circuit the lamp's power cord, and its smoke activates the sprinkler system, reviving them and the other dried sea creatures intended to be sold as souvenirs. As the vengeful sea creatures attack and overwhelm the Cyclops, SpongeBob and Patrick take the crown and head for the beach, where [[David Hasselhoff]] appears and offers them a ride. He swims from the beach to Bikini Bottom carrying them on his back. Dennis catches up to them, but is knocked back into the sea by a [[catamaran]]. Then, when they arrive at Bikini Bottom, Hasselhoff launches SpongeBob and Patrick down to the Krusty Krab 2.\n\nAt the Krusty Krab 2, King Neptune arrives to execute Mr. Krabs much to Plankton's enjoyment and Mindy's horror, but SpongeBob and Patrick return with the crown just before he is able to do so. They and Mindy confront Plankton, but he drops a king size mind-controlling bucket on Neptune, enslaving him and revealing that Plankton's plan was not just to steal the Krabby Patty formula but also to set Neptune up so he could take over the world. Before Plankton can direct Neptune to kill them, SpongeBob finally accepts his immaturity and bursts into a rock song, which destroys the mind-controlling helmets, freeing King Neptune, Squidward, and the rest of Bikini Bottom's residents from Plankton's control. Plankton tries to escape, but he is stepped on and flatted by the other citizens. Plankton is arrested for all of his crimes, while Neptune thaws out Mr. Krabs, who promotes SpongeBob to manager of the Krusty Krab 2 in gratitude.\n\n==Cast==\n{{See also|List of SpongeBob SquarePants cast members|List of SpongeBob SquarePants characters}}\n<!--This list includes the main cast only, as enumerated in the film's credits.

The film was co-written, directed, and produced by series creator [[Stephen Hillenburg]], with live-action sequences directed by [[Mark Osborne (filmmaker)|Mark Osborne]]. It features the series' cast of [[Tom Kenny]], [[Bill Fagerbakke]], [[Clancy Brown]], [[Rodger Bumpass]] and [[Mr. Lawrence]], and also has new actors which include [[Alec Baldwin]], [[David Hasselhoff]] (as himself), [[Scarlett Johansson]] and [[Jeffrey Tambor]]. It is the first film in the ''[[List of SpongeBob SquarePants films|SpongeBob SquarePants]]'' film series. In this film, [[Plankton (character)|Plankton]] devises a plan to discredit his business nemesis [[Mr. Krabs]], steal the [[Krabby Patty]] secret formula and take over the world by stealing [[Neptune (mythology)|King Neptune]]'s crown and framing Mr. Krabs for the crime. [[SpongeBob SquarePants (character)|SpongeBob]] and [[Patrick Star|Patrick]] team up to retrieve the crown from Shell City to save Mr. Krabs from Neptune's wrath and the oceanic world from Plankton's rule.\n\nPrevious offers by [[Paramount Pictures]] for a film adaptation of ''SpongeBob SquarePants'' had been rejected by Stephen Hillenburg, but he eventually accepted one offer in 2002. A writing team consisting of Hillenburg, [[Paul Tibbitt]], [[Derek Drymon]], [[Aaron Springer]], [[Kent Osborne]] and [[Tim Hill (director)|Tim Hill]] was assembled, conceiving the idea of a mythical hero's quest and the search for a stolen crown, which would bring SpongeBob and Patrick to the surface. The film was originally intended as the [[series finale]], but Nickelodeon ordered more episodes of the series as it had become increasingly profitable, so Hillenburg resigned as showrunner with Tibbitt taking his place.\n\nThe film was widely promoted by Paramount and Nickelodeon, with tie-in promotions made by [[7-Eleven]], the [[Cayman Islands]] and [[Burger King]], which decorated various of its franchises with {{convert|9|ft|adj=on}} SpongeBob inflatable figures. The film was released on November 19, 2004, grossing $140 million worldwide,<ref name=\"BOM\" /> and received generally positive reviews from critics. A second film titled ''[[The SpongeBob Movie: Sponge Out of Water]]'' was released on February 6, 2015, and another titled ''[[The SpongeBob Movie: Sponge on the Run]]'' is scheduled for release on August 7, 2020.\n\n==Plot==\n<!--Please keep the plot brief and concise. DO NOT ADD EVERY DETAIL.-->\nA band of [[Piracy|pirates]] discover a treasure chest full of movie tickets to see <nowiki>''The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie.'' All of the pirates cheer and sing ''</nowiki>[[SpongeBob SquarePants theme|the SpongeBob theme song]]<nowiki>''</nowiki> as they head to the movie theater to see the motion picture.\n\nThe movie begins when [[SpongeBob SquarePants (character)|SpongeBob SquarePants]] gets a dream of himself imitating in an action film when he wakes up, cheerfully prepares for the opening ceremony for a second [[Krusty Krab]], expecting his boss [[Mr. Krabs]] to promote him as new manager of the new restaurant. Instead, Mr. Krabs names [[Squidward Tentacles]], SpongeBob\u2019s next-door neighbor and co-worker, as manager, thinking SpongeBob is too immature to handle the role, much to SpongeBob's depression. Meanwhile, Mr. Krabs' business rival, [[Plankton and Karen#Plankton|Plankton]], complains about his failures to his computer wife [[Plankton and Karen#Karen|Karen]], being unable to steal the Krabby Patty formula. When Karen points out plan \"Z\", a scheme which he has yet to attempt, Plankton decides to implement it.\n\nThat night, SpongeBob drowns his sorrows in ice cream with his best friend [[Patrick Star]]. Elsewhere, Plankton steals [[List of SpongeBob SquarePants characters#Supporting characters|King Neptune]]'s crown, leaving false evidence to frame Mr. Krabs for the crime, and sends the crown to the distant land of Shell City. The next morning, Neptune barges into the Krusty Krab 2 and threatens Mr. Krabs for his alleged thievery. SpongeBob arrives and chastises Mr. Krabs under the influence of an ice-cream headache, but seeing his boss's life at risk shocks SpongeBob back to his senses and he promises Neptune that he will retrieve the crown from Shell City. Neptune is convinced by his daughter Mindy to spare Mr. Krabs for the time being and freezes him instead, ordering SpongeBob to return with the crown in exactly six days. Soon after SpongeBob and Patrick leave for Shell City, Plankton steals the Krabby Patty formula and uses it to produce and sell Krabby Patties at his restaurant, the Chum Bucket. He also gives away free Chum Bucket helmets to his customers, which are actually mind-controlling devices that Plankton activates to control Bikini Bottom's residents and take over the city. Squidward goes to the Chum Bucket to confront Plankton, but is captured and enslaved by the customers.\n\nAfter overcoming several setbacks on their journey, including sacrificing the Patty Wagon to escape a ravenous [[frogfish]], SpongeBob and Patrick reach a dangerous, monster-filled trench. When they finally come to the conclusion that they cannot finish the mission due to their immaturity, they tearfully give up. Mindy arrives at the trench and tells SpongeBob and Patrick about Plankton's plan. She pretends to magically turn them into men by giving them seaweed mustaches. With their confidence boosted, they brave the trench but are confronted by Dennis, a hitman hired by Plankton to eliminate them. Suddenly, Dennis is stepped on by a hard-hat diver that SpongeBob and Patrick believe to be a [[Cyclops]]. The Cyclops grabs SpongeBob and Patrick, and takes them to his beachside store, revealed to be Shell City.\n\nIn the store, SpongeBob and Patrick find the crown, but die when they are dehydrated by the Cyclops' heat lamp. Their tears short-circuit the lamp's power cord, and its smoke activates the sprinkler system, reviving them and the other dried sea creatures intended to be sold as souvenirs. As the vengeful sea creatures attack and overwhelm the Cyclops, SpongeBob and Patrick take the crown and head for the beach, where [[David Hasselhoff]] appears and offers them a ride. He swims from the beach to Bikini Bottom carrying them on his back. Dennis catches up to them, but is knocked back into the sea by a [[catamaran]]. Then, when they arrive at Bikini Bottom, Hasselhoff launches SpongeBob and Patrick down to the Krusty Krab 2.\n\nAt the Krusty Krab 2, King Neptune arrives to execute Mr. Krabs much to Plankton's enjoyment and Mindy's horror, but SpongeBob and Patrick return with the crown just before he is able to do so. They and Mindy confront Plankton, but he drops a king size mind-controlling bucket on Neptune, enslaving him and revealing that Plankton's plan was not just to steal the Krabby Patty formula but also to set Neptune up so he could take over the world. Before Plankton can direct Neptune to kill them, SpongeBob finally accepts his immaturity and bursts into a rock song, which destroys the mind-controlling helmets, freeing King Neptune, Squidward, and the rest of Bikini Bottom's residents from Plankton's control. Plankton tries to escape, but he is stepped on and flatted by the other citizens.

{"title_page": "Depth of noncommutative subrings", "text_new": "In [[ring theory]] and [[Frobenius algebra]] extensions, areas of mathematics, there is a notion of '''depth two  subring''' or '''depth of a Frobenius extension'''.  The notion of depth two is important in a certain  [[noncommutative Galois theory]], which generates [[Hopf algebroid]]s in place of the more classical [[Galois group]]s, whereas the notion of depth greater than two measures the defect, or distance, from being depth two in a tower of iterated endomorphism rings above the subring. A more recent definition of depth of any unital subring in any associative ring  is proposed (see below) in a paper studying the depth of a subgroup of a finite group as [[group ring|group algebra]]s over a commutative ring.\n\n== Definition and first examples ==\n\nA unital subring <math> B \\subseteq A </math> has (or is) '''right depth two''' if there is a split epimorphism of natural A-B-bimodules from <math> A^n \\rightarrow A \\otimes_B A </math> for some positive integer n; by switching to natural B-A-bimodules, there is a corresponding definition of '''left depth two'''. Here we use the usual notation <math> A^n = A \\times \\ldots \\times A</math> (n times) as well as the common notion, p is a split epimorphism if there is a homomorphism q in the reverse direction such that pq = identity on the image of p. (Sometimes the subring B in A is referred to as the ring extension A over B; the theory works as well for a ring homomorphism B into A, which induces right and left B-modules structures on A.) Equivalently, the condition for left or right depth two may be given in terms of a split monomorphism of bimodules where the domains and codomains above are reversed.\n\nFor example, let A be the group algebra of a finite group G (over any commutative base ring k; see the articles on [[group theory]] and [[group ring]] for the elementary definitions). Let B be the group (sub)algebra of a normal subgroup H of index n in G with coset representatives <math>g_1,\\cdots,g_n</math>. Define a split A-B epimorphism p:<math> A^n \\rightarrow A \\otimes_B A</math> by <math> p((a_1,\\cdots,a_n)) = \\sum_{i=1}^n a_i g_i^{-1} \\otimes_B g_i </math>.  It is split by the mapping <math>q: A \\otimes_B A \\rightarrow A^n </math> defined by <math> q(a \\otimes_B a') = (a \\gamma_1(a'),\\cdots,a\\gamma_n(a')) </math> where <math>\\gamma_i(g) = \\delta_{ij} g</math> for g in the coset <math> g_jH </math> (and extended linearly to a mapping A into B, a B-B-module homomorphism since H is normal in G):  the splitting condition pq = the identity on <math> A \\otimes_B A</math> is satisfied.  Thus B is right depth two in A.\n\nAs another example (perhaps more elementary than the first; see [[ring theory]] or [[module theory]] for some of the elementary notions), let A be an algebra over a commutative ring B, where B is taken to be in the center of A. Assume A is a finite projective B-module, so there are B-linear mapping <math> f_i: A \\rightarrow B </math> and elements <math> x_i \\in A </math> (i = 1,...,n) called a '''projective base''' for the B-module A if it satisfies <math> \\sum_{i=1}^n x_i f_i(a) = a</math> for all a in A.  It follows that B is left depth two in A by defining\n<math> p(a_1,\\cdots,a_n) = \\sum_{i=1}^n x_i \\otimes_B a_i </math> with splitting map <math> q(a \\otimes_B a') = (f_1(a)a',\\cdots,f_n(a)a')</math> as the reader may verify. A similar argument naturally shows that B is right depth two in A.\n\n==Depth in relation to Hopf algebras==\n\nFor a [[Frobenius algebra]] extension A | B (such as A and B group algebras of a subgroup pair of finite index) the two one-sided conditions of depth two are equivalent, and a notion of depth n > 2 makes sense via the right endomorphism ring extension iterated to generate a tower of rings (a technical procedure beyond the scope of this survey, although the first step, the endomorphism ring theorem, is described in the section on Frobenius extension under [[Frobenius algebra]]). For example, if B is a Hopf subalgebra of a finite-dimensional [[Hopf algebra]], then B has depth two in A if and only if B is normal in A (i.e. invariant under the left and right adjoint actions of A). Since a group algebra is a Hopf algebra, the first example above illustrates the back implication of the theorem. Other examples come from the fact that finite Hopf-Galois extensions are depth two in a strong sense (the split epimorphism in the definition may be replaced by a bimodule isomorphism).\n\nLet R be a Hopf subalgebra of a finite-dimensional Hopf algebra H.  Let R\u00b0 denote the maximal ideal of elements of R having counit value 0.  Then R\u00b0H is a right ideal and coideal in H, and the quotient module Q = H/R\u00b0H is a right H-module coalgebra.  For example, if H is a group algebra, then R is a subgroup algebra of H, and one shows as an exercise that Q is isomorphic to the permutation module on the right cosets. The 2013 paper referenced below proves that the depth of R in H is determined to the nearest even value by the depth of Q as an R-module (by restriction).  The depth of Q as an R-module is defined in that paper to be the least positive integer n such that Q\u2297\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5\u2297Q (n times Q, tensor product of R-modules, diagonal action of R from the right) has the same constituent [[indecomposable module]]s as Q \u2297\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5\u2297Q (n+1 times Q) (not counting multiplicities, an entirely similar definition for depth of Q as an H-module with closely related results).   As a consequence, the depth of R in H is finite if and only if its \"generalized quotient module\" Q represents an [[algebraic element]] in the [[representation ring]] (or Green ring) of R.  This is the case for example if Q is a [[projective module]], a [[Generator (category theory)|generator]] H-module or if Q is a permutation module over a group algebra R (i.e., Q has a basis that is a [[G-set]]).\nIn case H is a Hopf algebra that is a [[semisimple algebra]], the depth of Q is the length of the descending chain of annihilator ideals in H of increasing tensor powers of Q, which stabilize on the  maximal Hopf ideal within the [[Annihilator (ring theory)|annihilator]] ideal, Ann Q = { h in H such that Qh = 0 } (using a 1967 theorem of Rieffel).\n\n== Depth in relation to finite-dimensional semisimple algebras and subgroups of finite groups ==\n\nIf M is the inclusion matrix (or incidence matrix of the [[Bratteli diagram]]) of finite-dimensional semisimple (complex) algebras B and A, the depth two condition on the subalgebra B in A is given by an inequality <math> MM^tM \\leq nM </math> for some positive integer n (and each corresponding entry). Denoting the left-hand side of this inequality by the power <math> M^3</math> and similarly for all powers of the inclusion matrix M, the  condition of being depth <math> m \\geq 1</math> on the subalgebra pair of semisimple algebras is: <math> M^{m+1} \\leq n M^{m-1}</math>. (Notice that if M satisfies the depth m condition, then it satisfies the depth m+1 condition.) For example, a depth one subgroup H of a finite [[Group (mathematics)|group]] G, viewed as group algebras CH in CG over the complex numbers C, satisfies the condition on the centralizer <math>G = H C_G(X) </math> for each cyclic subgroup X in H (whence normal) ; e.g. H a subgroup in the center of G, or G = H x K.  As another example, consider the group algebras <math> B = CS_2 </math> and <math> A = CS_3 </math>, the order 2 and order 6 permutation groups on three letter a,b,c where the subgroup fixes c.  The inclusion matrix may be computed in at least three ways via idempotents, via character tables or via [[Littlewood-Richardson rule]] coefficients and combinatorics of skew tableaux to be (up to permutation) the 2 by 3 matrix with top row 1,1,0 and bottow row 0,1,1, which has depth three after applying the definition.\n\nIn a 2011 article in the Journal of Algebra by R. Boltje, S. Danz and B. Kuelshammer, they provide a simplified and extended definition of the depth of any unital subring B of associative ring A to be 2n+1 if <math> A\\otimes_B \\cdots \\otimes_B A</math> (n+1 times A) is isomorphic to a direct summand in \n<math> \\oplus_{i=1}^m A \\otimes_B \\cdots \\otimes_B A</math> (n times A) as B-B-bimodules for some positive integer m; similarly, B has depth 2n in A if\nthe same condition is satisfied more strongly as A-B-bimodules (or equivalently for free Frobenius extensions, as\nB-A-bimodules).  (This definition is equivalent to an earlier notion of depth in case A is a [[Frobenius algebra]] extension of B\nwith surjective Frobenius homomorphism, for example A and B are complex semisimple algebras.) Again notice that a subring having depth m implies that it has depth m+1, so they let <math> d(B,A) </math> denote the minimal depth. They then apply this to the group algebras of G and H over any commutative ring R.\n\nThey define a minimum combinatorial depth <math>d_c(H,G)</math> of a subgroup H of a finite group G mimicking the definition of depth of a subring but using [[G-set]]s and G-set homomorphisms instead of modules and module homomorphisms. They characterize combinatorial depth n as a condition on the number of conjugates of H intersecting in G thereby showing that combinatorial depth is finite.  In more detail, one defines an ascending chain of sets of subgroups of H starting with the zero'th stage singleton set of H, the first stage intersecting H by all its conjugate subgroups, and the n'th stage is to intersect all subgroups of H in the (n-1)'st stage by all conjugates of H. Then the combinatorial depth of H in G is 2n if the n'th stage subset is equal to the (n-1)'st stage subset.  For example, H is a normal subgroup of G if and only if H has combinatorial depth two in G. The minimum combinatorial depth follows from taking n to be minimum, and a technical definition of odd combinatorial depth. For example, <math>d_c(H,G)=1</math> if and only if <math>G=H C_G(H)</math> (i.e.,  G equals the product of H and its centralizer subgroup in G); in particular, H is normal in G.  In general, the minimum depth d(RH,RG)) is shown to be bounded by <math>d_c(H,G)</math>,  which in turn is bounded by twice the index of the normalizer of H in G.\n\n== Galois theory for depth two extensions and a Main Theorem ==\n\nMain classes of examples of depth two extensions are Galois extensions of algebras being acted upon by groups, Hopf algebras, weak Hopf algebras or [[Hopf algebroid]]s; for example, suppose a finite group G acts by automorphisms on an algebra A, then A is a depth two extension of its subalgebra B of invariants if the action is G-Galois, explained in detail in the article on [[Frobenius algebra]] extension (briefly called Frobenius extensions).\n\nConversely, any depth two extension A | B has a [[Galois]] theory based on the natural action of <math> \\mbox{End}\\, {}_BA_B </math> on A:  denoting this endomorphism ring by S, one shows S is a left bialgebroid over the centralizer R (those a in A commuting with all b in B) with a [[Galois theory]] similar to that of Hopf-Galois theory.  There is a right bialgebroid structure on the B-centralized elements T in <math> A \\otimes_B A </math> dual over R to S; certain endomorphism rings decompose as smash product, such as <math>\\mbox{End}\\, A_B \\cong   A \\otimes_R S </math>, i.e. isomorphic as rings to the smash product of the bialgebroid S (or its dual) with the ring A it acts on. Something similar is true for T and <math>\\mbox{End}\\, A \\otimes_B A_A</math> (often called a theory of duality of actions, which dates back in operator algebras to the 1970s). If A | B is in addition to being depth two a [[Frobenius algebra]] extension, the right and left endomorphism rings are anti-isomorphic, which restricts to an antipode on the bialgebroid <math> \\mbox{End}\\, {}_BA_B </math> satisfying axioms of a [[Hopf algebroid]]. There is the following relation with relative [[homological algebra]]: the relative Hochschild complex of A over B with coefficients in A, and cup product, is isomorphic as [[differential graded algebra]]s to the Amitsur complex of the R-coring S (with [[group-like element]] the identity on A; see Brzezinski-Wisbauer for the definition of the Amitsur cochain complex with product).\n\nThe Galois theory of a depth two extension is not irrelevant to a depth n > 2 Frobenius extension\nsince such a depth n extension embeds in a depth two extension in a tower of iterated endomorphism rings.  For example, given a depth three Frobenius extension of ring A over subring B, one can show that the left multiplication monomorphism <math> \\lambda: B \\rightarrow \\mbox{End}\\, A_B, \\   \\lambda(b)(a) =ba </math>  has depth two.\n\nThe main theorem in this subject is the following based on algebraic arguments in two of the articles below in [[Advances of Mathematics]] that are inspired from the field of [[operator algebra]]s, [[subfactor]]s: in particular, somewhat related to A. Ocneanu's definition of depth, his theory of paragroups, and the articles by W. Szymanski, Nikshych-Vainerman, R. Longo and others.\n\n:Main Theorem:  Suppose  an algebra A is a Frobenius extension of a subalgebra B having depth 2, a surjective Frobenius homomorphism and one-dimensional centralizer R, then A is Hopf-Galois extension of B.\n\nThe proof of this theorem is a reconstruction theorem, requiring the construction of a Hopf algebra as a minimum, but in most papers done by construction of a nondegenerate pairing of two algebras in the iterated endomorphism algebra tower above B in A, and then a very delicate check that the resulting algebra-coalgebra structure is a Hopf algebra (see for example the  article from 2001 below); the method of proof is considerably simplified by the 2003 article cited below (albeit packaged into the definition of Hopf algebroid).  The Hopf algebroid structure on the endomorphism ring S of the B-bimodule A (discussed above) becomes a Hopf algebra in the presence of the hypothesis that the centralizer <math> R = \\{ r \\in A : \\forall b \\in B, br = rb \\} </math> is one-dimensional.  The action of an endomorphism on its space of definition is shown to be a Hopf-Galois action.  The dual Hopf algebra T introduced above as well in the Hopf algebroid context and the dual left action becomes a right coaction that makes A a T-Galois extension of B.  The condition that the Frobenius homomorphism map A onto all of B is used to show that B is precisely the invariant subalgebra of the Hopf-Galois action (and not just contained within).  The condition that A be a Frobenius extension over B is not as important to the proof as the depth two hypothesis and might be avoided by imposing a progenerator module condition on A as a natural B-module.\n\n== References ==\n\n* Tomasz Brzezinski; Robert Wisbauer, ''Corings and Comodules''.

It is split by the mapping <math>q: A \\otimes_B A \\rightarrow A^n </math> defined by <math> q(a \\otimes_B a') = (a \\gamma_1(a'),\\cdots,a\\gamma_n(a')) </math> where <math>\\gamma_i(g) = \\delta_{ij} g</math> for g in the coset <math> g_jH </math> (and extended linearly to a mapping A into B, a B-B-module homomorphism since H is normal in G):  the splitting condition pq = the identity on <math> A \\otimes_B A</math> is satisfied.  Thus B is right depth two in A.\n\nAs another example (perhaps more elementary than the first; see [[ring theory]] or [[module theory]] for some of the elementary notions), let A be an algebra over a commutative ring B, where B is taken to be in the center of A. Assume A is a finite projective B-module, so there are B-linear mapping <math> f_i: A \\rightarrow B </math> and elements <math> x_i \\in A </math> (i = 1,...,n) called a '''projective base''' for the B-module A if it satisfies <math> \\sum_{i=1}^n x_i f_i(a) = a</math> for all a in A.  It follows that B is left depth two in A by defining\n<math> p(a_1,\\cdots,a_n) = \\sum_{i=1}^n x_i \\otimes_B a_i </math> with splitting map <math> q(a \\otimes_B a') = (f_1(a)a',\\cdots,f_n(a)a')</math> as the reader may verify. A similar argument naturally shows that B is right depth two in A.\n\n==Depth in relation to Hopf algebras==\n\nFor a [[Frobenius algebra]] extension A | B (such as A and B group algebras of a subgroup pair of finite index) the two one-sided conditions of depth two are equivalent, and a notion of depth n > 2 makes sense via the right endomorphism ring extension iterated to generate a tower of rings (a technical procedure beyond the scope of this survey, although the first step, the endomorphism ring theorem, is described in the section on Frobenius extension under [[Frobenius algebra]]). For example, if B is a Hopf subalgebra of a finite-dimensional [[Hopf algebra]], then B has depth two in A if and only if B is normal in A (i.e. invariant under the left and right adjoint actions of A). Since a group algebra is a Hopf algebra, the first example above illustrates the back implication of the theorem. Other examples come from the fact that finite Hopf-Galois extensions are depth two in a strong sense (the split epimorphism in the definition may be replaced by a bimodule isomorphism).\n\nLet R be a Hopf subalgebra of a finite-dimensional Hopf algebra H.  Let R\u00b0 denote the maximal ideal of elements of R having counit value 0.  Then R\u00b0H is a right ideal and coideal in H, and the quotient module Q = H/R\u00b0H is a right H-module coalgebra.  For example, if H is a group algebra, then R is a subgroup algebra of H, and one shows as an exercise that Q is isomorphic to the permutation module on the right cosets. The 2013 paper referenced below proves that the depth of R in H is determined to the nearest even value by the depth of Q as an R-module (by restriction).  The depth of Q as an R-module is defined in that paper to be the least positive integer n such that Q\u2297\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5\u2297Q (n times Q, tensor product of R-modules, diagonal action of R from the right) has the same constituent [[indecomposable module]]s as Q \u2297\u22c5\u22c5\u22c5\u2297Q (n+1 times Q) (not counting multiplicities, an entirely similar definition for depth of Q as an H-module with closely related results).   As a consequence, the depth of R in H is finite if and only if its \"generalized quotient module\" Q represents an [[algebraic element]] in the [[representation ring]] (or Green ring) of R.  This is the case for example if Q is a [[projective module]], a [[Generator (category theory)|generator]] H-module or if Q is a permutation module over a group algebra R (i.e., Q has a basis that is a [[G-set]]).\nIn case H is a Hopf algebra that is a [[semisimple algebra]], the depth of Q is the length of the descending chain of annihilator ideals in H of increasing tensor powers of Q, which stabilize on the  maximal Hopf ideal within the [[Annihilator (ring theory)|annihilator]] ideal, Ann Q = { h in H such that Qh = 0 } (using a 1967 theorem of Rieffel).\n\n== Depth in relation to finite-dimensional semisimple algebras and subgroups of finite groups ==\n\nIf M is the inclusion matrix (or incidence matrix of the [[Bratteli diagram]]) of finite-dimensional semisimple (complex) algebras B and A, the depth two condition on the subalgebra B in A is given by an inequality <math> MM^tM \\leq nM </math> for some positive integer n (and each corresponding entry). Denoting the left-hand side of this inequality by the power <math> M^3</math> and similarly for all powers of the inclusion matrix M, the  condition of being depth <math> m \\geq 1</math> on the subalgebra pair of semisimple algebras is: <math> M^{m+1} \\leq n M^{m-1}</math>. (Notice that if M satisfies the depth m condition, then it satisfies the depth m+1 condition.) For example, a depth one subgroup H of a finite [[Group (mathematics)|group]] G, viewed as group algebras CH in CG over the complex numbers C, satisfies the condition on the centralizer <math>G = H C_G(X) </math> for each cyclic subgroup X in H (whence normal) ; e.g. H a subgroup in the center of G, or G = H x K.  As another example, consider the group algebras <math> B = CS_2 </math> and <math> A = CS_3 </math>, the order 2 and order 6 permutation groups on three letter a,b,c where the subgroup fixes c.  The inclusion matrix may be computed in at least three ways via idempotents, via character tables or via [[Littlewood-Richardson rule]] coefficients and combinatorics of skew tableaux to be (up to permutation) the 2 by 3 matrix with top row 1,1,0 and bottow row 0,1,1, which has depth three after applying the definition.\n\nIn a 2011 article in the Journal of Algebra by R. Boltje, S. Danz and B. Kuelshammer, they provide a simplified and extended definition of the depth of any unital subring B of associative ring A to be 2n+1 if <math> A\\otimes_B \\cdots \\otimes_B A</math> (n+1 times A) is isomorphic to a direct summand in \n<math> \\oplus_{i=1}^m A \\otimes_B \\cdots \\otimes_B A</math> (n times A) as B-B-bimodules for some positive integer m; similarly, B has depth 2n in A if\nthe same condition is satisfied more strongly as A-B-bimodules (or equivalently for free Frobenius extensions, as\nB-A-bimodules).  (This definition is equivalent to an earlier notion of depth in case A is a [[Frobenius algebra]] extension of B\nwith surjective Frobenius homomorphism, for example A and B are complex semisimple algebras.) Again notice that a subring having depth m implies that it has depth m+1, so they let <math> d(B,A) </math> denote the minimal depth. They then apply this to the group algebras of G and H over any commutative ring R.\n\nThey define a minimum combinatorial depth <math>d_c(H,G)</math> of a subgroup H of a finite group G mimicking the definition of depth of a subring but using [[G-set]]s and G-set homomorphisms instead of modules and module homomorphisms. They characterize combinatorial depth n as a condition on the number of conjugates of H intersecting in G thereby showing that combinatorial depth is finite.  In more detail, one defines an ascending chain of sets of subgroups of H starting with the zero'th stage singleton set of H, the first stage intersecting H by all its conjugate subgroups, and the n'th stage is to intersect all subgroups of H in the (n-1)'st stage by all conjugates of H. Then the combinatorial depth of H in G is 2n if the n'th stage subset is equal to the (n-1)'st stage subset.  For example, H is a normal subgroup of G if and only if H has combinatorial depth two in G. The minimum combinatorial depth follows from taking n to be minimum, and a technical definition of odd combinatorial depth. For example, <math>d_c(H,G)=1</math> if and only if <math>G=H C_G(H)</math> (i.e.,  G equals the product of H and its centralizer subgroup in G); in particular, H is normal in G.  In general, the minimum depth d(RH,RG)) is shown to be bounded by <math>d_c(H,G)</math>,  which in turn is bounded by twice the index of the normalizer of H in G.\n\n== Galois theory for depth two extensions and a Main Theorem ==\n\nMain classes of examples of depth two extensions are Galois extensions of algebras being acted upon by groups, Hopf algebras, weak Hopf algebras or [[Hopf algebroid]]s; for example, suppose a finite group G acts by automorphisms on an algebra A, then A is a depth two extension of its subalgebra B of invariants if the action is G-Galois, explained in detail in the article on [[Frobenius algebra]] extension (briefly called Frobenius extensions).\n\nConversely, any depth two extension A | B has a [[Galois]] theory based on the natural action of <math> \\mbox{End}\\, {}_BA_B </math> on A:  denoting this endomorphism ring by S, one shows S is a left bialgebroid over the centralizer R (those a in A commuting with all b in B) with a [[Galois theory]] similar to that of Hopf-Galois theory.  There is a right bialgebroid structure on the B-centralized elements T in <math> A \\otimes_B A </math> dual over R to S; certain endomorphism rings decompose as smash product, such as <math>\\mbox{End}\\, A_B \\cong   A \\otimes_R S </math>, i.e. isomorphic as rings to the smash product of the bialgebroid S (or its dual) with the ring A it acts on. Something similar is true for T and <math>\\mbox{End}\\, A \\otimes_B A_A</math> (often called a theory of duality of actions, which dates back in operator algebras to the 1970s). If A | B is in addition to being depth two a [[Frobenius algebra]] extension, the right and left endomorphism rings are anti-isomorphic, which restricts to an antipode on the bialgebroid <math> \\mbox{End}\\, {}_BA_B </math> satisfying axioms of a [[Hopf algebroid]]. There is the following relation with relative [[homological algebra]]: the relative Hochschild complex of A over B with coefficients in A, and cup product, is isomorphic as [[differential graded algebra]]s to the Amitsur complex of the R-coring S (with [[group-like element]] the identity on A; see Brzezinski-Wisbauer for the definition of the Amitsur cochain complex with product).\n\nThe Galois theory of a depth two extension is not irrelevant to a depth n > 2 Frobenius extension\nsince such a depth n extension embeds in a depth two extension in a tower of iterated endomorphism rings.  For example, given a depth three Frobenius extension of ring A over subring B, one can show that the left multiplication monomorphism <math> \\lambda: B \\rightarrow \\mbox{End}\\, A_B, \\   \\lambda(b)(a) =ba </math>  has depth two.\n\nThe main theorem in this subject is the following based on algebraic arguments in two of the articles below in [[Advances of Mathematics]] that are inspired from the field of [[operator algebra]]s, [[subfactor]]s: in particular, somewhat related to A. Ocneanu's definition of depth, his theory of paragroups, and the articles by W. Szymanski, Nikshych-Vainerman, R. Longo and others.\n\n:Main Theorem:  Suppose  an algebra A is a Frobenius extension of a subalgebra B having depth 2, a surjective Frobenius homomorphism and one-dimensional centralizer R, then A is Hopf-Galois extension of B.\n\nThe proof of this theorem is a reconstruction theorem, requiring the construction of a Hopf algebra as a minimum, but in most papers done by construction of a nondegenerate pairing of two algebras in the iterated endomorphism algebra tower above B in A, and then a very delicate check that the resulting algebra-coalgebra structure is a Hopf algebra (see for example the  article from 2001 below); the method of proof is considerably simplified by the 2003 article cited below (albeit packaged into the definition of Hopf algebroid).  The Hopf algebroid structure on the endomorphism ring S of the B-bimodule A (discussed above) becomes a Hopf algebra in the presence of the hypothesis that the centralizer <math> R = \\{ r \\in A : \\forall b \\in B, br = rb \\} </math> is one-dimensional.  The action of an endomorphism on its space of definition is shown to be a Hopf-Galois action.  The dual Hopf algebra T introduced above as well in the Hopf algebroid context and the dual left action becomes a right coaction that makes A a T-Galois extension of B.  The condition that the Frobenius homomorphism map A onto all of B is used to show that B is precisely the invariant subalgebra of the Hopf-Galois action (and not just contained within).  The condition that A be a Frobenius extension over B is not as important to the proof as the depth two hypothesis and might be avoided by imposing a progenerator module condition on A as a natural B-module.\n\n== References ==\n\n* Tomasz Brzezinski; Robert Wisbauer, ''Corings and Comodules''.
