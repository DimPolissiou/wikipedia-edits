The provincial governments of Ontario, New Brunswick and Manitoba are required to provide services in French where justified by the number of francophones (those whose mother tongue is French or who use French on a daily basis). French is also an official language of all three territories. However, the [[Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms]] requires all provinces and territories to provide primary and secondary education to their official-language minorities.\n\n==The evolution of the French language in Canada==\n\n===16th century ===\n\nIn 1524, the Florentine navigator [[Giovanni da Verrazzano]], working for Italian bankers in France, explored the American coast from [[Spanish Florida|Florida]] to [[Cape Breton (Nova Scotia)|Cape Breton]]. In 1529, Verrazzano mapped a part of the coastal region of the North American continent under the name Nova Gallia ([[New France]]). In 1534, King [[Francis I of France|Francis I]] of France sent [[Jacques Cartier]] to explore previously unfamiliar lands. Cartier found the [[Gulf of Saint Lawrence]], sealed an alliance with the local people and obtained passage to go farther. During his second expedition (1535\u20131536), Cartier came upon the [[Saint Lawrence River]], a path into the heart of the continent. However, Cartier failed to establish a permanent colony in the area, and war in Europe kept France from further colonization through the end of the 16th century.<ref name=\"Atlas Universalis 1996 p.57\">Atlas Universalis (1996), Tome 2, p. 57</ref><ref>Atlas Universalis (1996), Tome 5, p. 23</ref>\n\n===17th century===\n\nAt the beginning of the 17th century, French settlements and private companies were established in the area that is now eastern Canada. In 1605, [[Samuel de Champlain]] founded [[Habitation at Port-Royal|Port Royal]] ([[Acadia]]), and in 1608 he founded [[Quebec City]]. In 1642, the foundation of Ville Marie, the settlement that would eventually become [[Montreal]], completed the occupation of the territory.\n\nIn 1634, Quebec contained 200 settlers who were principally involved in the fur trade. The trade was profit-making and the city was on the point of becoming more than a mere temporary trading post.\n\nIn 1635, [[Jesuits]] founded the secondary school of Quebec for the education of children. In 1645, the Compagnie des Habitants was created, uniting the political and economic leaders of the colony. [[French language|French]] was the language of all the non-native people.\n\nIn 1685, the revocation of the [[Edict of Nantes]] by [[Louis XIV]] (1654\u20131715), which had legalized freedom of religion of the [[Reformed Church]], caused the emigration from France of 300,000 [[Huguenots]] (French Calvinists) to other countries of Europe and to North America.<ref>Atlas Universalis (1996) Tome 4, pp. 837-838</ref>\n\n===18th century===\n\nWith the [[Treaty of Utrecht]] in 1713, the British began their domination of eastern North America, some parts of which had been controlled by the French. The British took mainland [[Nova Scotia]] in 1713. Present-day [[Maine]] fell to the British during [[Father Rale's War]], while present-day [[New Brunswick]] fell after [[Father Le Loutre's War]]. In 1755 the majority of the French-speaking inhabitants of Nova Scotia were deported to the [[Thirteen Colonies]]. After 1758, they were deported to England and France. The [[Treaty of Paris (1763)]] completed the British takeover, removing France from Canadian territory, except for [[Saint Pierre and Miquelon]] at the entrance of the Gulf of Saint Lawrence.\n\nThe French language was relegated to second rank as far as trade and state communications were concerned. Out of necessity, the educated class learned the [[English language]] and became progressively bilingual, but the great majority of the French-speaking inhabitants continued to speak only French, and their population increased. Anglicization of the French population failed, and it became obvious that coexistence was required. In 1774, [[Parliament of Great Britain|Parliament]] passed the [[Quebec Act]], restoring French civil laws and abrogating the [[Test Act]], which had been used to suppress Catholicism.<ref>Atlas Universalis (1996) Tome 4, pp. 838-839</ref>\n\n===Canada as a federal state===\n\nIn 1791, Parliament repealed the Quebec Act and gave the king authority to divide the Canadian colony into two new provinces: [[Upper Canada]], which later became Ontario, and [[Lower Canada]], which became Quebec.\n \nIn 1867, three colonies of British North America agreed to form a federal state, which was named [[Canada]]. It was composed of four provinces: \n* [[Ontario]], formerly Upper Canada\n* [[Quebec]], formerly Lower Canada\n* [[Nova Scotia]]\n* [[New Brunswick]], former Acadian territory\n\nIn Quebec, French became again the official language; until then it was the [[vernacular language]] but with no legal status.<ref>Atlas Universalis (1996) Tome 4, pp. 840-842</ref><ref>Atlas Universalis (1996) Tome 19, pp. 397-404</ref><ref>{{cite book |last1=Bourhis |first1=Richard Y. |last2=Lepicq |first2=Dominique |date=1993 |chapter=Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois French and language issues in Qu\u00e9bec |title=Trends in Romance Linguistics and Philology. |volume=Volume 5: Bilingualism and Linguistic Conflict in Romance |editor-first1=Rebecca |editor-last1=Posner |editor-first2=John N. |editor-last2=Green |publisher=Mouton De Gruyter |location=New York |isbn=311011724X}}</ref>\n\n=== Historical use of the term \"Canadian French\" ===\nThe term \"Canadian French\" was formerly used to refer specifically to Quebec French and to the closely related varieties of Ontario and Western Canada that descended from it.<ref>Francard and Latin, in ''Le r\u00e9gionalisme lexical'', write:\n: \"Le fran\u00e7ais du Qu\u00e9bec a rayonn\u00e9 en Ontario et dans l'ouest du Canada, de m\u00eame qu'en Nouvelle-Angleterre. [...] Le fran\u00e7ais qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois et le fran\u00e7ais acadien peuvent \u00eatre regroup\u00e9s sous l'appellation plus large de ''fran\u00e7ais canadien''<sup>2</sup>, laquelle englobe aussi le fran\u00e7ais ontarien et le fran\u00e7ais de l'Ouest canadien. Ces deux derniers poss\u00e8dent des traits caract\u00e9ristiques qui leur sont propres aujourd'hui dans l'ensemble canadien et qui s'expliquent surtout par un ph\u00e9nom\u00e8ne de conservatisme, mais il s'agit de vari\u00e9t\u00e9s qui sont historiquement des prolongements du fran\u00e7ais qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois.\n: <sup>2</sup>Il faut noter ici que le terme de \"fran\u00e7ais canadien\" avait autrefois un sens plus restreint, d\u00e9signant le fran\u00e7ais du Qu\u00e9bec et les vari\u00e9t\u00e9s qui s'y rattachent directement, d'o\u00f9 l'emploi \u00e0 cette \u00e9poque de \"canadianisme\" pour parler d'un trait caract\u00e9ristique du fran\u00e7ais du Qu\u00e9bec.\"</ref> This is presumably because Canada and Acadia were distinct parts of New France, and also of British North America, until 1867. However, today the term Canadian French is not usually deemed to exclude Acadian French.\n\n[[Phylogenetic tree|Phylogenetically]], Quebec French, M\u00e9tis French and [[Brayon]] French are representatives of [[Koin\u00e9 language|koin\u00e9]] French in the Americas, whereas Acadian French, Cajun French and Newfoundland French are derivatives of non-koinesized local dialects in France.<ref>Robert Fournier & Henri Wittmann. 1995. ''Le fran\u00e7ais des Am\u00e9riques''. Trois-Rivi\u00e8res: Presses universitaires de Trois-Rivi\u00e8res.</ref>\n\n==French dialects==\nAs a consequence of geographical seclusion and as a result of British conquest, the French language in Canada presents three different but related main dialects. They share certain features that distinguish them from European French. The name ''Canadian French'' has been used as an umbrella term for all of these varieties.{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}\n\nAll of these dialects mix, to varying degrees, elements from regional languages and folk dialects spoken in France at the time of colonization. For instance, the origins of Quebec French lie in 17th- and 18th-century Parisian French, influenced by folk dialects of the early [[French language|modern period]] and other [[O\u00efl languages|regional languages]] (such as [[Norman language|Norman]], [[Picard language|Picard]] and [[Poitevin (language)|Poitevin]]-[[Saintongeais dialect|Saintongeais]]) that French colonists had brought to [[New France]]. It has been asserted that the influence of these dialects has been stronger on Acadian French than on French spoken in Quebec.{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}} The three dialects can also be historically and geographically associated with three of the five former colonies of [[New France]]: [[Canada, New France|Canada]], [[Acadia]] and [[Colony of Newfoundland|Terre-Neuve (Newfoundland)]].\n\nIn addition, there is a [[mixed language]] known as [[Michif language|Michif]], which is based on [[Cree language|Cree]] and [[French language|French]]. It is spoken by [[M\u00e9tis]] communities in [[Manitoba]] and [[Saskatchewan]] as well as within adjacent areas of the United States.\n\nImmigration after World War II has brought francophone immigrants from around the world, and with them other [[French dialects]].\n\n=== Varieties ===\n''[[Quebec French]]'' is spoken in [[Quebec]]. Closely related varieties are spoken by francophone communities in [[Ontario]], [[Western Canada]], [[Labrador]] and in the [[New England]] region of the United States, and they differ from Quebec French primarily by their greater conservatism. The term ''Laurentian French'' has limited application as a collective label for all these varieties, and ''Quebec French'' has also been used for the entire dialect group. The overwhelming majority of [[francophone]] Canadians speak this dialect.\n\n''[[Acadian French]]'' is spoken by over 350,000 [[Acadians]] in parts of the [[Maritime Provinces]], [[Newfoundland and Labrador|Newfoundland]], the [[Magdalen Islands]] and the [[Gasp\u00e9 peninsula]].<ref>[http://www.ethnologue.com/show_country.asp?name=CA Ethnologue report for Canada]</ref>\n\n''[[M\u00e9tis French]]'' is spoken in [[Manitoba]] and [[Western Canada]] by the [[M\u00e9tis people (Canada)|M\u00e9tis]], descendants of [[First Nations]] mothers and [[Voyageurs|voyageur]] fathers during the era of [[fur trade]]. Many M\u00e9tis spoke Cree in addition to French, and over the years they developed a unique mixed language called Michif by combining M\u00e9tis French nouns, numerals, articles and adjectives with Cree verbs, demonstratives, postpositions, interrogatives and pronouns. Both the Michif language and the M\u00e9tis dialect of French are [[Language death|severely endangered]].\n\n''[[Newfoundland French]]'' is spoken by a small population on the [[Port au Port Peninsula|Port-au-Port Peninsula]] of [[Newfoundland and Labrador|Newfoundland]]. It is endangered; Quebec French and Acadian French are now more widely spoken among Newfoundland francophones than the distinctive peninsular dialect.\n\n''[[Brayon|Brayon French]]'' is spoken in the [[Beauce, Quebec|Beauce]] of Quebec; Edmundston, New Brunswick and Madawaska, Maine. Although superficially a phonological descendant of Acadian French, analysis reveals it is [[morphosyntactic]]ally identical to Quebec French.<ref>Geddes, James (1908). ''Study of the Acadian-French language spoken on the north shore of the Baie-des-Chaleurs''. Halle: Niemeyer; Wittmann, Henri (1995) \"Grammaire compar\u00e9e des vari\u00e9t\u00e9s coloniales du fran\u00e7ais populaire de Paris du 17<sup>e</sup> si\u00e8cle et origines du fran\u00e7ais qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois.\" in Fournier, Robert & Henri Wittmann.

Essentially a local variant of Quebec French, it is one of three major forms of French that developed in what is now the U.S., the others being [[Louisiana French]] and the nearly extinct [[Missouri French]].

Today, 81.4 per cent of Quebecers are first language francophones.<ref name=\"www12.statcan.ca\">[http://www12.statcan.ca/english/census01/products/analytic/companion/lang/provs.cfm Profile of languages in Canada: Provinces and territories<!-- Bot generated title -->]. Retrieved 3 May 2011.</ref> About 95 per cent of Quebecers speak French.<ref name=statcan2016qc /> However, many of the services the provincial government provides are available in English for the sizeable [[English-speaking Quebecer|anglophone]] population of the province (notably in [[Montreal]]). For native French speakers, [[Quebec French]] is noticeably different in pronunciation and vocabulary from the [[French language|French]] of [[France]], sometimes called ''Metropolitan French'', but they are easily mutually intelligible in their formal varieties, and after moderate exposure, in most of their informal ones as well. The differences are primarily due to changes that have occurred in Quebec French and [[Parisian French]] since the 18th century, when Britain gained possession of Canada.\n\nDifferent regions of Quebec have their own varieties: [[Gasp\u00e9 Peninsula]], [[C\u00f4te-Nord]], [[Quebec City]], [[Saguenay-Lac-Saint-Jean]], [[Outaouais (region)|Outaouais]], and [[Abitibi-T\u00e9miscamingue]] have differences in pronunciation as well as in vocabulary. For example, depending on one's region, the ordinary word for \"kettle\" can be {{lang|fr|bouilloire, bombe,}} or {{lang|fr|canard}}.\n\nIn Quebec, the French language is of paramount importance. For example, the [[stop sign]]s on the roads are written {{lang|fr|ARR\u00caT}} (which has the literal meaning of \"stop\" in French), even if other French-speaking countries, like [[France]], use ''STOP''. On a similar note, movies originally made in other languages than French (mostly movies originally made in English) are more literally named in Quebec than they are in France (e.g. The movie ''[[The Love Guru]]'' is called {{lang|fr|Love Gourou}} in France, but in Quebec it is called {{lang|fr|Le Gourou de l'amour}}). Also, [[French-speaking Quebecer|Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois]] do not always use the same words as the French. Here are some examples:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n! English !! Quebec French !! Metropolitan French\n|-\n| weekend || fin de semaine || week-end\n|-\n| parking lot || stationnement || parking \n|-\n| e-mail || courriel || mail/courriel\n|-\n| spam || pourriel || spam\n|-\n| online chat || clavardage || chat/tchat\n|-\n| beverage || breuvage/boisson || boisson\n|-\n| [[lunch]] || d\u00eener || d\u00e9jeuner\n|-\n| [[dinner]] || souper || d\u00eener\n|-\n| washing machine || laveuse || machine \u00e0 laver \n|-\n| clothes dryer || s\u00e9cheuse || s\u00e8che-linge\n|}\n\n====Use of anglicisms====\nThe term [[anglicism]] ({{lang|fr|Anglicisme}}) is related to the linguistic concepts of [[loanwords]], [[Barbarism (linguistics)|barbarism]], [[diglossia]] or the [[macaronic]] mixture of the French (fran\u00e7ais) and English (anglais) languages\n\nAccording to some, French spoken in Canada includes many anglicisms. The [[Quebec Office of the French Language]]'s \"{{lang|fr|Banque de d\u00e9pannage linguistique}}\" (Language Troubleshooting Database)<ref>http://bdl.oqlf.gouv.qc.ca/bdl/</ref> distinguishes between different kinds of anglicisms:<ref>{{cite web|last=Office qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois de la langue fran\u00e7aise|title=Anglicismes|url=http://www.oqlf.gouv.qc.ca/francilettre/francilettreEX_20070914.html |accessdate=5 May 2011}}</ref>\n* The entire anglicisms are words or groups of [[loan words]] from the English Language. The form is often exactly the same as in English, e.g. : \"glamour\", \"short\" and \"sweet\", but sometimes there is a slight adjustment to the French language, e.g.: \"{{lang|fr|drabe}}\", which comes from the English word \"drab\".\n* The hybrid anglicisms, which are new words, a combination of an English word to which a French element is added. This element (a suffix, for instance) sometimes replaces a similar element of the English word. \"{{lang|fr|Booster}}\" is an example of hybrid anglicism: it is made up of the English verb \"to boost\", to which the French suffix  \u2013er is added.\n* Plenty of anglicisms are semantic anglicisms: they are French words used in a sense which exists in English, but not in French. {{lang|fr|Ajourner}} (\"postpone\") in the sense of \"to have a break\", {{lang|fr|path\u00e9tique}} in the sense of \"miserable\" or \"pitiful\", {{lang|fr|plancher}} (\"floor/surface\") in the sense of \"floor\" (level of a building) and {{lang|fr|pr\u00e9judice}} (\"harm/injury\") in the sense of \"(unfavorable) opinion\".\n* The syntactic anglicisms are those relating to the word order of a sentence and the use of prepositions and conjunctions. The expression \"{{lang|fr|un bon dix minutes}}\" (\"a good ten minutes\"), for instance, comes from the English language; the more conventional French wording would be \"{{lang|fr|dix bonnes minutes}}\". The use of the preposition {{lang|fr|pour}} (\"for\") after the verbs {{lang|fr|demander}} (\"ask [for]\") and {{lang|fr|chercher}} (\"search/look [for]\") is also a syntactic anglicism.\n* The morphological anglicisms are literal translations (or {{lang|fr|[[calques]]}}) of the English forms. With this kind of loan words, every element comes from the French language, but what results from it as a whole reproduces, completely or partly, the image transmitted in English. The word {{lang|fr|technicalit\u00e9}}, for instance, is formed under English influence and does not exist in standard French (which would instead use the phrasing \"{{lang|fr|d\u00e9tail technique}}\"). {{lang|fr|\u00c0 l'ann\u00e9e longue}} (\"all year long\"), {{lang|fr|appel conf\u00e9rence}} (\"conference call\") and {{lang|fr|prix de liste}} (\"list price\") are other morphological examples of anglicisms.\n* Finally, the sentencial anglicisms are loan set phrases or images peculiar to the English language. The expressions {{lang|fr|ajouter l'insulte \u00e0 l'injure}} (\"add insult to injury\") and {{lang|fr|sonner une cloche}} (\"ring a bell\") are sentencial anglicisms. [[Loi 101|Law 101]] could postpone the advance of the phenomenon or even prevent it.\n\nAcademic, colloquial and pejorative terms are used in Canada (such as {{lang|fr|des \"sabirisation\"}} (from {{lang|fr|sabir}}, \"[[pidgin]]\"), [[Franglais]], [[Fran\u00e7ais qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois]], [[Canadian French]]) to refer to the vernacular.\n\n====Syntactic and semantic characteristics====\n\nIn general, the same norms as in common French are applied. Only certain words have a different gender. Notable from a semantic point of view are the use of the word \"pis\" for the conjunction \"and\", where \"et\" would be used in Metropolitan French; the word \"l\u00e0\" to punctuate the end of a sentence or after a word; and the use of \"\u00e0\" instead of the possessive \"de\", for instance, \"la maison \u00e0 Jacques\" for \"Jacques's house\".\n\n====Use of the ''tu'' form====\nFrench is a language with a [[T\u2013V distinction]], where different pronouns are used for polite and familiar address. Quebecers use the familiar {{lang|fr|tu}} form more than other dialects. This use is often qualified as the imitation of the English-speaking use of ''you'', which is the only pronoun referring to the second person, but only in spoken language.\n\n===Atlantic Canada===\n\n[[File:The Acadians.png|thumb|left|150px|Present-day Acadian communities]]\n\n====Historical review====\nThe colonists living in what are now the provinces of [[New Brunswick]] and [[Nova Scotia]] were principally constituted of [[Bretons]], [[Normans]], and [[Basques]]. Conquered by the English, they suffered [[Expulsion of the Acadians|massive deportations]] to the [[United States]] and [[France]]. Others went into exile to [[Canada (New France)|Canada]] or to nearby islands. Those who stayed were persecuted. At the end of the 18th century, more liberal measures granted new lands to those who had stayed, and measures were taken to promote the return of numerous exiled people from Canada and [[Miquelon]]. The number of Acadians rose rapidly, to the point of gaining representation in the [[Legislative Assembly]].\n\nFrench is one of the official languages, with English, of the province of [[New Brunswick]]. Apart from [[Quebec]], this is the only other Canadian province that recognizes French as an official language. Approximately one-third of New Brunswickers are francophone,<ref name=\"www12.statcan.ca\"/> by far the largest [[Acadian]] population in Canada.\n\nThe Acadian community is concentrated in primarily rural areas along the border with Quebec and the eastern coast of the province. Francophones in the [[Madawaska County, New Brunswick|Madawaska]] area may also be identified as [[Brayon]], although sociologists have disputed whether the Brayons represent a distinct francophone community, a subgroup of the Acadians or an extraprovincial community of Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois.  The only major Acadian population centre is [[Moncton]], home to the main campus of the [[Universit\u00e9 de Moncton]]. Francophones are, however, in the minority in Moncton.\n\nIn addition to New Brunswick, Acadian French has speakers in portions of mainland Quebec and in the Atlantic provinces of [[Nova Scotia]], [[Prince Edward Island]], and [[Newfoundland and Labrador|Newfoundland]]. In these provinces, the percentage of francophones is much smaller than in New Brunswick. In some communities, French is an [[endangered language]].\n\n====Origins of the dialect====\n\nLinguists do not agree about the origin of [[Acadian French]]. [[Acadian French]] is influenced by the ''[[langues d'o\u00efl]]''. The dialect contains, among other features, the [[alveolar consonant|alveolar]] ''r'' and the pronunciation of the final syllable in the plural form of the verb in the third person. Acadia is the only place outside [[Jersey]] (a [[Channel Islands|Channel Island]] close to mainland Normandy) where [[J\u00e8rriais]] speakers can be found.<ref>Atlas Universalis (1996), Th\u00e9saurus A-C, p. 24</ref>\n\n====Some characteristics====\nThe variety of French spoken in [[Atlantic Canada]] possesses features that differ from [[Quebec French]].\n\nAccording to Wiesmath (2006),<ref>{{cite book|title=Le fran\u00e7ais acadien: analyse syntaxique d'un corpus oral recueilli au Nouveau-Brunswick, Canada|last=Wiesmath|first=Rapha\u00eble|publisher=l'Hamalthan|year=2006}}[https://archive.org/details/lefrancaisacadie0000wies]. ''Accessed 5 May 2011''.</ref> some characteristics of Acadian are:\n*The verbal ending -ont in the third person plural\n*Palatalization of {{IPA|/k/}} and {{IPA|/\u0261/}} to {{IPA|[t\u0283]}} and {{IPA|[d\u0292]}}, respectively\n*A featured called \"l'ouisme\" where ''bonne'' is pronounced {{IPA|[bun]}}\nThese features typically occur in older speech.\n\nYves Cormier's ''Dictionnaire du fran\u00e7ais acadien'' (ComiersAcad)<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=nJGvPwAACAAJ&dq=dictionnaire+du+fran%C3%A7ais+acadien&hl=en&ei=XXjCTci3LIKWOvn5xZ0I&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CDEQ6AEwAA{{cite book|last=Cormier|first=Yves|title=Dictionnaire du fran\u00e7ais acadien|year=2009|publisher=Fides, Editions}}]. Retrieved 5 May 2011.</ref> includes the majority of Acadian regionalisms. From a syntactic point of view, a major feature is the use of ''je'' both for the first person singular and for the third plural; the same phenomenon takes place with ''i'' for the third persons. Acadian still differentiates the ''vous'' form from the ''tu'' form.\n\nHowever, because of contact with francophones from other parts of Canada, the distinctive characteristics of Acadian French have been progressively weakened.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=nJGvPwAACAAJ&dq=dictionnaire+du+fran%C3%A7ais+acadien&hl=en&ei=XXjCTci3LIKWOvn5xZ0I&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CDEQ6AEwAA{{cite book|last=Valdman|first=Albert|title=French and Creole in Louisiana|year=1997|publisher=Premium Press|location=New-York}}]. Retrieved 5 May 2011.</ref>\n\nIn addition, English has influenced Acadian French through the borrowing of words, many of which used to be French words used in the English language.\n\n===Ontario===\n\nAlthough French is the native language of just over half a million Canadians in [[Ontario]], francophone Ontarians represent only 4.4 per cent of the province's population. They are concentrated primarily in the [[Eastern Ontario]] and [[Northeastern Ontario]] regions, near the border with [[Quebec]], although they are also present in smaller numbers throughout the province. Forty per cent of [[Franco-Ontarian]]s no longer speak the language at home. However, [[Ottawa]] is the city which counts the biggest number of [[Franco-Ontarian]]s. The Franco-Ontarians are originally from a first wave of immigration from [[France]], from a second wave from Quebec. The third wave comes from Quebec, but also from Haiti, Morocco, Africa, etc.\n\nThe province has no official language defined in law, although it is a largely English-speaking province. Ontario law requires that the provincial [[Legislative Assembly]] operate in both English and French (individuals can speak in the Assembly in the official language of their choice), and requires that all provincial statutes and bills be made available in both English and French. Furthermore, under the [[French Language Services Act]], individuals are entitled to communicate with the head or central office of any provincial government department or agency in French, as well as to receive all government services in French in 25 designated areas in the province, selected according to minority population criteria. The provincial government of Ontario's website is bilingual. Residents of [[Ottawa]], [[Toronto]], [[Windsor, Ontario|Windsor]], [[Greater Sudbury|Sudbury]] and [[Timmins]] can receive services from their municipal government in the official language of their choice.\n\nThere are also several French-speaking communities on military bases in Ontario, such as the one at [[CFB Trenton]]. These communities have been founded by francophone Canadians in the [[Canadian Forces]] who live together in military residences.<ref>{{cite web|last=Statistiques Canada|title=Population dont le fran\u00e7ais est la langue parl\u00e9e le plus souvent \u00e0 la maison, Canada, Provinces, territoires et Canada moins le Qu\u00e9bec, 1996 \u00e0 2006 |url=http://www.statcan.gc.ca/ |accessdate=4 November 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |author1=David Block |title=Globalization and language teaching |year=2002 |publisher=Taylor and Francis Group |author2=Heller Monica}}</ref>\n\n====Franco-Ontarian====\n\nThe term [[Franco-Ontarian]] accepts two interpretations. According to the first one, it includes all French speakers of Ontario, wherever they come from. According to second one, it includes all French Canadians born in Ontario, whatever their level of French is.<ref>Atlas Universalis (1996), Th\u00e9saurus K-M, p. 2638</ref>\n\nThe modern Franco-Ontarian language is close to Quebec French with some rare exceptions of expressions and pronunciations. Once again, the influence of English can be noted, with a big recourse to tonic stresses, but nevertheless a French vocabulary is still used. According to Michel Laurier (1989),<ref>{{cite book|title=Le subjonctif dans le parler franco-ontarien : un mode en voie de disparition ?|last=Laurier|first=Michel|publisher=Universit\u00e9 Carleton|year=1989|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EUzqrzHNwP0C&pg=PA105|page=105}}</ref> the semantic and stylistic value of the use of the subjunctive is progressively disappearing.

[[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]] was annexed by [[England]] in 1583. It is the first British possession in [[North America]].\n\nIn 1610, the Frenchmen became established in the [[peninsula of Avalon]] and went to war against the Englishmen. In 1713, the [[Treaty of Utrecht]] acknowledged the sovereignty of the Englishmen.\n\nThe origin of [[Franco-Newfoundlanders]] is double: the first ones to arrive are especially of [[Breton people|Breton]] origin, attracted by the fishing possibilities. Then, from the 19th century, the Acadians who came from the [[Cape Breton Island]] and from the [[Magdalen Islands]], an archipelago of nine small islands belonging to Quebec, become established.\n\nUp to the middle of the 20th century, Breton fishers, who had Breton as their mother tongue, but who had been educated in French came to settle. This Breton presence can explain differences between the Newfoundland French and the [[Acadian French]].\n\nIn the 1970s, the French language appears in the school of Cape St. George in the form of a bilingual education. In the 1980s, classes of French for native French speakers are organized there.<ref name=\"Atlas Universalis 1996 p.57\" /><ref>Atlas Universalis (1996), Tome 4, pp. 840-842</ref>\n\n====Characteristics of French of Newfoundland====\nAccording to Patrice Brasseur's articles \" Les Repr\u00e9sentations linguistiques des francophones de la p\u00e9ninsule de Port-au-Port \" (2007)<ref>{{cite journal|last=Brasseur|first=Patrice|title=Les Repr\u00e9sentations linguistiques des francophones de la p\u00e9ninsule de Port-au-Port|journal=Glottopol, Revue de sociolinguistique en ligne|volume=9|pages=66\u201379}}[https://scholar.google.com/] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110624020514/https://scholar.google.com/|date=24 June 2011}}.

The provincial government of [[Manitoba]] boasts the only bilingual website of the Prairies; the Canadian constitution makes French an official language in Manitoba for the legislature and courts. Saskatchewan also has a [[Fransaskois]] community, as does Alberta with its [[Franco-Albertan]]s, and British Columbia hosts the [[Franco-Columbian]]s.\n\n[[Michif]], a dialect of French originating in Western Canada, is a unique [[mixed language]] derived from [[Cree language|Cree]] and French.

The provincial governments of Ontario, New Brunswick and Manitoba are required to provide services in French where justified by the number of francophones (those whose mother tongue is French or who use French on a daily basis). French is also an official language of all three territories. However, the [[Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms]] requires all provinces and territories to provide primary and secondary education to their official-language minorities.\n\n==The evolution of the French language in Canada==\n\n===16th century ===\n\nIn 1524, the Florentine navigator [[Giovanni da Verrazzano]], working for Italian bankers in France, explored the American coast from [[Spanish Florida|Florida]] to [[Cape Breton (Nova Scotia)|Cape Breton]]. In 1529, Verrazzano mapped a part of the coastal region of the North American continent under the name Nova Gallia ([[New France]]). In 1534, King [[Francis I of France|Francis I]] of France sent [[Jacques Cartier]] to explore new lands. Cartier found the [[Gulf of Saint Lawrence]], sealed an alliance with the local people and obtained passage to go farther. During his second expedition (1535\u20131536), Cartier came upon the [[Saint Lawrence River]], a path into the heart of the continent. However, Cartier failed to establish a permanent colony in the area, and war in Europe kept France from further colonization through the end of the 16th century.<ref name=\"Atlas Universalis 1996 p.57\">Atlas Universalis (1996), Tome 2, p. 57</ref><ref>Atlas Universalis (1996), Tome 5, p. 23</ref>\n\n===17th century===\n\nAt the beginning of the 17th century, French settlements and private companies were established in the area that is now eastern Canada. In 1605, [[Samuel de Champlain]] founded [[Habitation at Port-Royal|Port Royal]] ([[Acadia]]), and in 1608 he founded [[Quebec City]]. In 1642, the foundation of Ville Marie, the settlement that would eventually become [[Montreal]], completed the occupation of the territory.\n\nIn 1634, Quebec contained 200 settlers who were principally involved in the fur trade. The trade was profit-making and the city was on the point of becoming more than a mere temporary trading post.\n\nIn 1635, [[Jesuits]] founded the secondary school of Quebec for the education of children. In 1645, the Compagnie des Habitants was created, uniting the political and economic leaders of the colony. [[French language|French]] was the language of all the non-native people.\n\nIn 1685, the revocation of the [[Edict of Nantes]] by [[Louis XIV]] (1654\u20131715), which had legalized freedom of religion of the [[Reformed Church]], caused the emigration from France of 300,000 [[Huguenots]] (French Calvinists) to other countries of Europe and to North America.<ref>Atlas Universalis (1996) Tome 4, pp. 837-838</ref>\n\n===18th century===\n\nWith the [[Treaty of Utrecht]] in 1713, the British began their domination of eastern North America, some parts of which had been controlled by the French. The British took mainland [[Nova Scotia]] in 1713. Present-day [[Maine]] fell to the British during [[Father Rale's War]], while present-day [[New Brunswick]] fell after [[Father Le Loutre's War]]. In 1755 the majority of the French-speaking inhabitants of Nova Scotia were deported to the [[Thirteen Colonies]]. After 1758, they were deported to England and France. The [[Treaty of Paris (1763)]] completed the British takeover, removing France from Canadian territory, except for [[Saint Pierre and Miquelon]] at the entrance of the Gulf of Saint Lawrence.\n\nThe French language was relegated to second rank as far as trade and state communications were concerned. Out of necessity, the educated class learned the [[English language]] and became progressively bilingual, but the great majority of the French-speaking inhabitants continued to speak only French, and their population increased. Anglicization of the French population failed, and it became obvious that coexistence was required. In 1774, [[Parliament of Great Britain|Parliament]] passed the [[Quebec Act]], restoring French civil laws and abrogating the [[Test Act]], which had been used to suppress Catholicism.<ref>Atlas Universalis (1996) Tome 4, pp. 838-839</ref>\n\n===Canada as a federal state===\n\nIn 1791, Parliament repealed the Quebec Act and gave the king authority to divide the Canadian colony into two new provinces: [[Upper Canada]], which later became Ontario, and [[Lower Canada]], which became Quebec.\n \nIn 1867, three colonies of British North America agreed to form a federal state, which was named [[Canada]]. It was composed of four provinces: \n* [[Ontario]], formerly Upper Canada\n* [[Quebec]], formerly Lower Canada\n* [[Nova Scotia]]\n* [[New Brunswick]], former Acadian territory\n\nIn Quebec, French became again the official language; until then it was the [[vernacular language]] but with no legal status.<ref>Atlas Universalis (1996) Tome 4, pp. 840-842</ref><ref>Atlas Universalis (1996) Tome 19, pp. 397-404</ref><ref>{{cite book |last1=Bourhis |first1=Richard Y. |last2=Lepicq |first2=Dominique |date=1993 |chapter=Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois French and language issues in Qu\u00e9bec |title=Trends in Romance Linguistics and Philology. |volume=Volume 5: Bilingualism and Linguistic Conflict in Romance |editor-first1=Rebecca |editor-last1=Posner |editor-first2=John N. |editor-last2=Green |publisher=Mouton De Gruyter |location=New York |isbn=311011724X}}</ref>\n\n=== Historical use of the term \"Canadian French\" ===\nThe term \"Canadian French\" was formerly used to refer specifically to Quebec French and to the closely related varieties of Ontario and Western Canada that descended from it.<ref>Francard and Latin, in ''Le r\u00e9gionalisme lexical'', write:\n: \"Le fran\u00e7ais du Qu\u00e9bec a rayonn\u00e9 en Ontario et dans l'ouest du Canada, de m\u00eame qu'en Nouvelle-Angleterre.

Ces deux derniers poss\u00e8dent des traits caract\u00e9ristiques qui leur sont propres aujourd'hui dans l'ensemble canadien et qui s'expliquent surtout par un ph\u00e9nom\u00e8ne de conservatisme, mais il s'agit de vari\u00e9t\u00e9s qui sont historiquement des prolongements du fran\u00e7ais qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois.\n: <sup>2</sup>Il faut noter ici que le terme de \"fran\u00e7ais canadien\" avait autrefois un sens plus restreint, d\u00e9signant le fran\u00e7ais du Qu\u00e9bec et les vari\u00e9t\u00e9s qui s'y rattachent directement, d'o\u00f9 l'emploi \u00e0 cette \u00e9poque de \"canadianisme\" pour parler d'un trait caract\u00e9ristique du fran\u00e7ais du Qu\u00e9bec.\"</ref> This is presumably because Canada and Acadia were distinct parts of New France, and also of British North America, until 1867. However, today the term Canadian French is not usually deemed to exclude Acadian French.\n\n[[Phylogenetic tree|Phylogenetically]], Quebec French, M\u00e9tis French and [[Brayon]] French are representatives of [[Koin\u00e9 language|koin\u00e9]] French in the Americas, whereas Acadian French, Cajun French and Newfoundland French are derivatives of non-koinesized local dialects in France.<ref>Robert Fournier & Henri Wittmann. 1995.

Trois-Rivi\u00e8res: Presses universitaires de Trois-Rivi\u00e8res.</ref>\n\n==French dialects==\nAs a consequence of geographical seclusion and as a result of British conquest, the French language in Canada presents three different but related main dialects. They share certain features that distinguish them from European French. The name ''Canadian French'' has been used as an umbrella term for all of these varieties.{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}\n\nAll of these dialects mix, to varying degrees, elements from regional languages and folk dialects spoken in France at the time of colonization. For instance, the origins of Quebec French lie in 17th- and 18th-century Parisian French, influenced by folk dialects of the early [[French language|modern period]] and other [[O\u00efl languages|regional languages]] (such as [[Norman language|Norman]], [[Picard language|Picard]] and [[Poitevin (language)|Poitevin]]-[[Saintongeais dialect|Saintongeais]]) that French colonists had brought to [[New France]]. It has been asserted that the influence of these dialects has been stronger on Acadian French than on French spoken in Quebec.{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}} The three dialects can also be historically and geographically associated with three of the five former colonies of [[New France]]: [[Canada, New France|Canada]], [[Acadia]] and [[Colony of Newfoundland|Terre-Neuve (Newfoundland)]].\n\nIn addition, there is a [[mixed language]] known as [[Michif language|Michif]], which is based on [[Cree language|Cree]] and [[French language|French]]. It is spoken by [[M\u00e9tis]] communities in [[Manitoba]] and [[Saskatchewan]] as well as within adjacent areas of the United States.\n\nImmigration after World War II has brought francophone immigrants from around the world, and with them other [[French dialects]].\n\n=== Varieties ===\n''[[Quebec French]]'' is spoken in [[Quebec]]. Closely related varieties are spoken by francophone communities in [[Ontario]], [[Western Canada]], [[Labrador]] and in the [[New England]] region of the United States, and they differ from Quebec French primarily by their greater conservatism. The term ''Laurentian French'' has limited application as a collective label for all these varieties, and ''Quebec French'' has also been used for the entire dialect group. The overwhelming majority of [[francophone]] Canadians speak this dialect.\n\n''[[Acadian French]]'' is spoken by over 350,000 [[Acadians]] in parts of the [[Maritime Provinces]], [[Newfoundland and Labrador|Newfoundland]], the [[Magdalen Islands]] and the [[Gasp\u00e9 peninsula]].<ref>[http://www.ethnologue.com/show_country.asp?name=CA Ethnologue report for Canada]</ref>\n\n''[[M\u00e9tis French]]'' is spoken in [[Manitoba]] and [[Western Canada]] by the [[M\u00e9tis people (Canada)|M\u00e9tis]], descendants of [[First Nations]] mothers and [[Voyageurs|voyageur]] fathers during the era of [[fur trade]]. Many M\u00e9tis spoke Cree in addition to French, and over the years they developed a unique mixed language called Michif by combining M\u00e9tis French nouns, numerals, articles and adjectives with Cree verbs, demonstratives, postpositions, interrogatives and pronouns. Both the Michif language and the M\u00e9tis dialect of French are [[Language death|severely endangered]].\n\n''[[Newfoundland French]]'' is spoken by a small population on the [[Port au Port Peninsula|Port-au-Port Peninsula]] of [[Newfoundland and Labrador|Newfoundland]]. It is endangered; Quebec French and Acadian French are now more widely spoken among Newfoundland francophones than the distinctive peninsular dialect.\n\n''[[Brayon|Brayon French]]'' is spoken in the [[Beauce, Quebec|Beauce]] of Quebec; Edmundston, New Brunswick and Madawaska, Maine. Although superficially a phonological descendant of Acadian French, analysis reveals it is [[morphosyntactic]]ally identical to Quebec French.<ref>Geddes, James (1908).

Essentially a local variant of Quebec French, it is one of three major forms of French that developed in what is now the U.S., the others being [[Louisiana French]] and the nearly extinct [[Missouri French]]. It is endangered, though its use has been supported by bilingual education programs since 1987.<ref name=\"Ammon\">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=geh261xgI8sC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false|title=Status and Function of Languages and Language Varieties|last=Ammon|first=Ulrich|publisher=Walter de Gruyter|year=1989|isbn=0-89925-356-3|pages=306\u2013308|author2=International Sociological Association|accessdate=1 February 2012}}</ref>\n\n==== Sub-varieties ====\nTwo main sub-varieties of Canadian French have been identified.

Today, 81.4 per cent of Quebecers are first language francophones.<ref name=\"www12.statcan.ca\">[http://www12.statcan.ca/english/census01/products/analytic/companion/lang/provs.cfm Profile of languages in Canada: Provinces and territories<!-- Bot generated title -->]. Retrieved 3 May 2011.</ref> About 95 per cent of Quebecers speak French.<ref name=statcan2016qc /> However, many of the services the provincial government provides are available in English for the sizeable [[English-speaking Quebecer|anglophone]] population of the province (notably in [[Montreal]]). For native French speakers, [[Quebec French]] is noticeably different in pronunciation and vocabulary from the [[French language|French]] of [[France]], sometimes called ''Metropolitan French'', but they are easily mutually intelligible in their formal varieties, and after moderate exposure, in most of their informal ones as well. The differences are primarily due to changes that have occurred in Quebec French and [[Parisian French]] since the 18th century, when Britain gained possession of Canada.\n\nDifferent regions of Quebec have their own varieties: [[Gasp\u00e9 Peninsula]], [[C\u00f4te-Nord]], [[Quebec City]], [[Saguenay-Lac-Saint-Jean]], [[Outaouais (region)|Outaouais]], and [[Abitibi-T\u00e9miscamingue]] have differences in pronunciation as well as in vocabulary. For example, depending on one's region, the ordinary word for \"kettle\" can be {{lang|fr|bouilloire, bombe,}} or {{lang|fr|canard}}.\n\nIn Quebec, the French language is of paramount importance. For example, the [[stop sign]]s on the roads are written {{lang|fr|ARR\u00caT}} (which has the literal meaning of \"stop\" in French), even if other French-speaking countries, like [[France]], use ''STOP''. On a similar note, movies originally made in other languages than French (mostly movies originally made in English) are more literally named in Quebec than they are in France (e.g. The movie ''[[The Love Guru]]'' is called {{lang|fr|Love Gourou}} in France, but in Quebec it is called {{lang|fr|Le Gourou de l'amour}}). Also, [[French-speaking Quebecer|Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois]] do not always use the same words as the French. Here are some examples:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n! English !! Quebec French !! Metropolitan French\n|-\n| weekend || fin de semaine || week-end\n|-\n| parking lot || stationnement || parking \n|-\n| e-mail || courriel || mail/courriel\n|-\n| spam || pourriel || spam\n|-\n| online chat || clavardage || chat/tchat\n|-\n| beverage || breuvage/boisson || boisson\n|-\n| [[lunch]] || d\u00eener || d\u00e9jeuner\n|-\n| [[dinner]] || souper || d\u00eener\n|-\n| washing machine || laveuse || machine \u00e0 laver \n|-\n| clothes dryer || s\u00e9cheuse || s\u00e8che-linge\n|}\n\n====Use of anglicisms====\nThe term [[anglicism]] ({{lang|fr|Anglicisme}}) is related to the linguistic concepts of [[loanwords]], [[Barbarism (linguistics)|barbarism]], [[diglossia]] or the [[macaronic]] mixture of the French (fran\u00e7ais) and English (anglais) languages\n\nAccording to some, French spoken in Canada includes many anglicisms. The [[Quebec Office of the French Language]]'s \"{{lang|fr|Banque de d\u00e9pannage linguistique}}\" (Language Troubleshooting Database)<ref>http://bdl.oqlf.gouv.qc.ca/bdl/</ref> distinguishes between different kinds of anglicisms:<ref>{{cite web|last=Office qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois de la langue fran\u00e7aise|title=Anglicismes|url=http://www.oqlf.gouv.qc.ca/francilettre/francilettreEX_20070914.html |accessdate=5 May 2011}}</ref>\n* The entire anglicisms are words or groups of [[loan words]] from the English Language. The form is often exactly the same as in English, e.g. : \"glamour\", \"short\" and \"sweet\", but sometimes there is a slight adjustment to the French language, e.g.: \"{{lang|fr|drabe}}\", which comes from the English word \"drab\".\n* The hybrid anglicisms, which are new words, a combination of an English word to which a French element is added. This element (a suffix, for instance) sometimes replaces a similar element of the English word. \"{{lang|fr|Booster}}\" is an example of hybrid anglicism: it is made up of the English verb \"to boost\", to which the French suffix  \u2013er is added.\n* Plenty of anglicisms are semantic anglicisms: they are French words used in a sense which exists in English, but not in French. {{lang|fr|Ajourner}} (\"postpone\") in the sense of \"to have a break\", {{lang|fr|path\u00e9tique}} in the sense of \"miserable\" or \"pitiful\", {{lang|fr|plancher}} (\"floor/surface\") in the sense of \"floor\" (level of a building) and {{lang|fr|pr\u00e9judice}} (\"harm/injury\") in the sense of \"(unfavorable) opinion\".\n* The syntactic anglicisms are those relating to the word order of a sentence and the use of prepositions and conjunctions. The expression \"{{lang|fr|un bon dix minutes}}\" (\"a good ten minutes\"), for instance, comes from the English language; the more conventional French wording would be \"{{lang|fr|dix bonnes minutes}}\". The use of the preposition {{lang|fr|pour}} (\"for\") after the verbs {{lang|fr|demander}} (\"ask [for]\") and {{lang|fr|chercher}} (\"search/look [for]\") is also a syntactic anglicism.\n* The morphological anglicisms are literal translations (or {{lang|fr|[[calques]]}}) of the English forms. With this kind of loan words, every element comes from the French language, but what results from it as a whole reproduces, completely or partly, the image transmitted in English. The word {{lang|fr|technicalit\u00e9}}, for instance, is formed under English influence and does not exist in standard French (which would instead use the phrasing \"{{lang|fr|d\u00e9tail technique}}\"). {{lang|fr|\u00c0 l'ann\u00e9e longue}} (\"all year long\"), {{lang|fr|appel conf\u00e9rence}} (\"conference call\") and {{lang|fr|prix de liste}} (\"list price\") are other morphological examples of anglicisms.\n* Finally, the sentencial anglicisms are loan set phrases or images peculiar to the English language. The expressions {{lang|fr|ajouter l'insulte \u00e0 l'injure}} (\"add insult to injury\") and {{lang|fr|sonner une cloche}} (\"ring a bell\") are sentencial anglicisms. [[Loi 101|Law 101]] could postpone the advance of the phenomenon or even prevent it.\n\nAcademic, colloquial and pejorative terms are used in Canada (such as {{lang|fr|des \"sabirisation\"}} (from {{lang|fr|sabir}}, \"[[pidgin]]\"), [[Franglais]], [[Fran\u00e7ais qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois]], [[Canadian French]]) to refer to the vernacular.\n\n====Syntactic and semantic characteristics====\n\nIn general, the same norms as in common French are applied. Only certain words have a different gender. Notable from a semantic point of view are the use of the word \"pis\" for the conjunction \"and\", where \"et\" would be used in Metropolitan French; the word \"l\u00e0\" to punctuate the end of a sentence or after a word; and the use of \"\u00e0\" instead of the possessive \"de\", for instance, \"la maison \u00e0 Jacques\" for \"Jacques's house\".\n\n====Use of the ''tu'' form====\nFrench is a language with a [[T\u2013V distinction]], where different pronouns are used for polite and familiar address. Quebecers use the familiar {{lang|fr|tu}} form more than other dialects. This use is often qualified as the imitation of the English-speaking use of ''you'', which is the only pronoun referring to the second person, but only in spoken language.\n\n===Atlantic Canada===\n\n[[File:The Acadians.png|thumb|left|150px|Present-day Acadian communities]]\n\n====Historical review====\nThe colonists living in what are now the provinces of [[New Brunswick]] and [[Nova Scotia]] were principally constituted of [[Bretons]], [[Normans]], and [[Basques]]. Conquered by the English, they suffered [[Expulsion of the Acadians|massive deportations]] to the [[United States]] and [[France]]. Others went into exile to [[Canada (New France)|Canada]] or to nearby islands. Those who stayed were persecuted. At the end of the 18th century, more liberal measures granted new lands to those who had stayed, and measures were taken to promote the return of numerous exiled people from Canada and [[Miquelon]]. The number of Acadians rose rapidly, to the point of gaining representation in the [[Legislative Assembly]].\n\nFrench is one of the official languages, with English, of the province of [[New Brunswick]]. Apart from [[Quebec]], this is the only other Canadian province that recognizes French as an official language. Approximately one-third of New Brunswickers are francophone,<ref name=\"www12.statcan.ca\"/> by far the largest [[Acadian]] population in Canada.\n\nThe Acadian community is concentrated in primarily rural areas along the border with Quebec and the eastern coast of the province. Francophones in the [[Madawaska County, New Brunswick|Madawaska]] area may also be identified as [[Brayon]], although sociologists have disputed whether the Brayons represent a distinct francophone community, a subgroup of the Acadians or an extraprovincial community of Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois.  The only major Acadian population centre is [[Moncton]], home to the main campus of the [[Universit\u00e9 de Moncton]]. Francophones are, however, in the minority in Moncton.\n\nIn addition to New Brunswick, Acadian French has speakers in portions of mainland Quebec and in the Atlantic provinces of [[Nova Scotia]], [[Prince Edward Island]], and [[Newfoundland and Labrador|Newfoundland]]. In these provinces, the percentage of francophones is much smaller than in New Brunswick. In some communities, French is an [[endangered language]].\n\n====Origins of the dialect====\n\nLinguists do not agree about the origin of [[Acadian French]]. [[Acadian French]] is influenced by the ''[[langues d'o\u00efl]]''. The dialect contains, among other features, the [[alveolar consonant|alveolar]] ''r'' and the pronunciation of the final syllable in the plural form of the verb in the third person. Acadia is the only place outside [[Jersey]] (a [[Channel Islands|Channel Island]] close to mainland Normandy) where [[J\u00e8rriais]] speakers can be found.<ref>Atlas Universalis (1996), Th\u00e9saurus A-C, p. 24</ref>\n\n====Some characteristics====\nThe variety of French spoken in [[Atlantic Canada]] possesses features that differ from [[Quebec French]].\n\nAccording to Wiesmath (2006),<ref>{{cite book|title=Le fran\u00e7ais acadien: analyse syntaxique d'un corpus oral recueilli au Nouveau-Brunswick, Canada|last=Wiesmath|first=Rapha\u00eble|publisher=l'Hamalthan|year=2006}}[https://archive.org/details/lefrancaisacadie0000wies]. ''Accessed 5 May 2011''.</ref> some characteristics of Acadian are:\n*The verbal ending -ont in the third person plural\n*Palatalization of {{IPA|/k/}} and {{IPA|/\u0261/}} to {{IPA|[t\u0283]}} and {{IPA|[d\u0292]}}, respectively\n*A featured called \"l'ouisme\" where ''bonne'' is pronounced {{IPA|[bun]}}\nThese features typically occur in older speech.\n\nYves Cormier's ''Dictionnaire du fran\u00e7ais acadien'' (ComiersAcad)<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=nJGvPwAACAAJ&dq=dictionnaire+du+fran%C3%A7ais+acadien&hl=en&ei=XXjCTci3LIKWOvn5xZ0I&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CDEQ6AEwAA{{cite book|last=Cormier|first=Yves|title=Dictionnaire du fran\u00e7ais acadien|year=2009|publisher=Fides, Editions}}]. Retrieved 5 May 2011.</ref> includes the majority of Acadian regionalisms. From a syntactic point of view, a major feature is the use of ''je'' both for the first person singular and for the third plural; the same phenomenon takes place with ''i'' for the third persons. Acadian still differentiates the ''vous'' form from the ''tu'' form.\n\nHowever, because of contact with francophones from other parts of Canada, the distinctive characteristics of Acadian French have been progressively weakened.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=nJGvPwAACAAJ&dq=dictionnaire+du+fran%C3%A7ais+acadien&hl=en&ei=XXjCTci3LIKWOvn5xZ0I&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CDEQ6AEwAA{{cite book|last=Valdman|first=Albert|title=French and Creole in Louisiana|year=1997|publisher=Premium Press|location=New-York}}]. Retrieved 5 May 2011.</ref>\n\nIn addition, English has influenced Acadian French through the borrowing of words, many of which used to be French words used in the English language.\n\n===Ontario===\n\nAlthough French is the native language of just over half a million Canadians in [[Ontario]], francophone Ontarians represent only 4.4 per cent of the province's population. They are concentrated primarily in the [[Eastern Ontario]] and [[Northeastern Ontario]] regions, near the border with [[Quebec]], although they are also present in smaller numbers throughout the province. Forty per cent of [[Franco-Ontarian]]s no longer speak the language at home. However, [[Ottawa]] is the city which counts the biggest number of [[Franco-Ontarian]]s. The Franco-Ontarians are originally from a first wave of immigration from [[France]], from a second wave from Quebec. The third wave comes from Quebec, but also from Haiti, Morocco, Africa, etc.\n\nThe province has no official language defined in law, although it is a largely English-speaking province. Ontario law requires that the provincial [[Legislative Assembly]] operate in both English and French (individuals can speak in the Assembly in the official language of their choice), and requires that all provincial statutes and bills be made available in both English and French. Furthermore, under the [[French Language Services Act]], individuals are entitled to communicate with the head or central office of any provincial government department or agency in French, as well as to receive all government services in French in 25 designated areas in the province, selected according to minority population criteria. The provincial government of Ontario's website is bilingual. Residents of [[Ottawa]], [[Toronto]], [[Windsor, Ontario|Windsor]], [[Greater Sudbury|Sudbury]] and [[Timmins]] can receive services from their municipal government in the official language of their choice.\n\nThere are also several French-speaking communities on military bases in Ontario, such as the one at [[CFB Trenton]]. These communities have been founded by francophone Canadians in the [[Canadian Forces]] who live together in military residences.<ref>{{cite web|last=Statistiques Canada|title=Population dont le fran\u00e7ais est la langue parl\u00e9e le plus souvent \u00e0 la maison, Canada, Provinces, territoires et Canada moins le Qu\u00e9bec, 1996 \u00e0 2006 |url=http://www.statcan.gc.ca/ |accessdate=4 November 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |author1=David Block |title=Globalization and language teaching |year=2002 |publisher=Taylor and Francis Group |author2=Heller Monica}}</ref>\n\n====Franco-Ontarian====\n\nThe term [[Franco-Ontarian]] accepts two interpretations. According to the first one, it includes all French speakers of Ontario, wherever they come from. According to second one, it includes all French Canadians born in Ontario, whatever their level of French is.<ref>Atlas Universalis (1996), Th\u00e9saurus K-M, p. 2638</ref>\n\nThe modern Franco-Ontarian language is close to Quebec French with some rare exceptions of expressions and pronunciations. Once again, the influence of English can be noted, with a big recourse to tonic stresses, but nevertheless a French vocabulary is still used. According to Michel Laurier (1989),<ref>{{cite book|title=Le subjonctif dans le parler franco-ontarien : un mode en voie de disparition ?|last=Laurier|first=Michel|publisher=Universit\u00e9 Carleton|year=1989|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EUzqrzHNwP0C&pg=PA105|page=105}}</ref> the semantic and stylistic value of the use of the subjunctive is progressively disappearing. In the article \"Le fran\u00e7ais canadien parl\u00e9 hors Qu\u00e9bec : aper\u00e7u sociolinguistique \" (1989),<ref>{{cite book|last=Thomas|first=Alain|title=La variabilit\u00e9 en fran\u00e7ais ontarien|year=1989|publisher=Les presses de l'Universit\u00e9 de Laval|location=Canada}}</ref> Edward Berniak and Raymond Mougeon underline some characteristics: \n* the use of the possessive ''\u00e0''\n* the transfer of rules from English to French, e.g., \"J\u2019ai vu un film sur/\u00e0 la t\u00e9l\u00e9vision\" which comes from \"I saw a film on television\", or \" Je vais \u00e0 la maison/chez moi \" coming from \"I'm going home\".\n* the loaning of English conjunctions, for instance, \"so\" for ''\u00e7a fait que'' or ''alors''.\n\nThe use of French among Franco-Ontarians is in decline due to the omnipresence of the English language in a lot of fields.\n\n===Newfoundland===\n====Historical review====\nThe island was discovered by European powers by [[John Cabot]] in 1497. [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]] was annexed by [[England]] in 1583. It is the first British possession in [[North America]].\n\nIn 1610, the Frenchmen became established in the [[peninsula of Avalon]] and went to war against the Englishmen. In 1713, the [[Treaty of Utrecht]] acknowledged the sovereignty of the Englishmen.\n\nThe origin of [[Franco-Newfoundlanders]] is double: the first ones to arrive are especially of [[Breton people|Breton]] origin, attracted by the fishing possibilities. Then, from the 19th century, the Acadians who came from the [[Cape Breton Island]] and from the [[Magdalen Islands]], an archipelago of nine small islands belonging to Quebec, become established.\n\nUp to the middle of the 20th century, Breton fishers, who had Breton as their mother tongue, but who had been educated in French came to settle. This Breton presence can explain differences between the Newfoundland French and the [[Acadian French]].\n\nIn the 1970s, the French language appears in the school of Cape St. George in the form of a bilingual education. In the 1980s, classes of French for native French speakers are organized there.<ref name=\"Atlas Universalis 1996 p.57\" /><ref>Atlas Universalis (1996), Tome 4, pp. 840-842</ref>\n\n====Characteristics of French of Newfoundland====\nAccording to Patrice Brasseur's articles \" Les Repr\u00e9sentations linguistiques des francophones de la p\u00e9ninsule de Port-au-Port \" (2007)<ref>{{cite journal|last=Brasseur|first=Patrice|title=Les Repr\u00e9sentations linguistiques des francophones de la p\u00e9ninsule de Port-au-Port|journal=Glottopol, Revue de sociolinguistique en ligne|volume=9|pages=66\u201379}}[https://scholar.google.com/] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110624020514/https://scholar.google.com/|date=24 June 2011}}.

The provincial government of [[Manitoba]] boasts the only bilingual website of the Prairies; the Canadian constitution makes French an official language in Manitoba for the legislature and courts. Saskatchewan also has a [[Fransaskois]] community, as does Alberta with its [[Franco-Albertan]]s, and British Columbia hosts the [[Franco-Columbian]]s.\n\n[[Michif]], a dialect of French originating in Western Canada, is a unique [[mixed language]] derived from [[Cree language|Cree]] and French. It is spoken by a small number of [[Metis (people)|M\u00e9tis]] living mostly in [[Manitoba]] and in [[North Dakota]].\n\n===Northern Canada===\nFrench is an official language in each of the three northern territories: the [[Yukon]], the [[Northwest Territories]], and [[Nunavut]]. Francophones in the Yukon are called [[Franco-Yukonnais]], those from the Northwest Territories, [[Franco-T\u00e9nois]] (from the French acronym for the Northwest Territories, ''T.N.-O.''), and those in Nunavut, [[Franco-Nunavois]].\n\n==French-speaking communities in Canada outside of Quebec==\n* [[Franco-Ontarian]]s (or ''Ontarois'')\n* [[Acadian]]s (in [[New Brunswick]], [[Nova Scotia]] and [[Prince Edward Island]]; also present in portions of [[Quebec]] and [[Newfoundland and Labrador|Newfoundland]])\n* [[Franco-Manitoban]]s\n* [[Fransaskois]] (in [[Saskatchewan]])\n* [[Franco-Albertan]]s\n* [[Franco-Columbian]]s\n* [[Franco-Terreneuviens]]\n* [[Franco-T\u00e9nois]] (in the [[Northwest Territories]])\n* [[Franco-Yukonnais|Franco-Yukon(n)ais]] (in the [[Yukon Territory|Yukon]])\n* Franco-Nunavois (in [[Nunavut]])\n\n==See also==\n*[[Office qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois de la langue fran\u00e7aise]]\n*[[Charter of the French Language]]\n*[[Canadian French]]\n*[[Quebec French]]\n*[[Official bilingualism in Canada]]\n*[[Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois (word)|Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois]]\n*[[Joual]]\n*[[Chiac]]\n*[[Quebec French lexicon]]\n*[[French Canadian]]\n*[[Languages of Canada]]\n*[[Acadian French]]\n*[[Metis French]]\n*[[Influence of French on English]]\n*[[French language in the United States]]\n*[[French language]]\n*[[French phonology]]\n*[[Michif language]]\n*[[American French]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/index.cfm?PgNm=TCE&Params=A1SEC820953 \"French language: Canadian French today\"] ''[[Canadian Encyclopedia|The Canadian Encyclopedia]]''.

The same legend relates that the chapel passed into the possession of [[Benedict of Nursia]] in 516. It was known as Our Lady of the Valley of Josaphat or of the Angels \u2013 the latter title referring, according to some, to the [[assumption of Mary]] accompanied by angels; a better-founded opinion attributes the name to a legend attesting to the singing of angels which had been frequently heard there.<ref name=bihl>[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12286a.htm Bihl, Michael. \"Portiuncula.\" The Catholic Encyclopedia.

Francis took this literally to mean the ruined church in which he was presently praying, and so sold his horse and some cloth from his father's store, to assist the priest there for this purpose. His father Pietro, highly indignant, sought restitution. After a final interview in the presence of the bishop, Francis renounced his father and his patrimony, laying aside even the garments he had received from him. For the next couple of months he lived as a beggar in the region of Assisi. Returning to the town for two years this time, he restored several ruined churches, among them the Porziuncola, little chapel of St Mary of the Angels, just outside the town.<ref name=robinson>[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06221a.htm Robinson, Paschal. \"St. Francis of Assisi.\" The Catholic Encyclopedia. Vol. 6.

Here he founded the [[Franciscan]]s. Around 1211 the small chapel was given to Francis by the [[abbot]] of Saint Benedict of Monte Subasio on condition of making it the mother house of his religious family. On Palm Sunday 1211 St Francis received in this church [[Clare of Assisi]] and founded the Second Order of the Poor Ladies [[Poor Clares]]. Adjoining this humble sanctuary, already dear to Francis, the first Franciscan convent was formed by the erection of a few small huts or cells of wattle, straw, and mud, and enclosed by a hedge.<ref name=robinson/>\n\nThe General Chapters, the annual meetings of the friars, were held in this church usually during [[Pentecost]] (months of May \u2013 June).\n\nFeeling his end approaching, St Francis asked to be brought back to the Portiuncola in September 1226. On his death-bed St Francis recommended the chapel to the faithful protection and care of his brethren. He died, in his cell, not fifteen yards from the church, at sunset on Saturday, 3 October 1226. \n\nHowever this may be, here or in this neighbourhood was the cradle of the Franciscan Order. After the death of Francis, the spiritual value and the charisma of the Porziuncola became even greater. St Francis himself pointed out the Portiuncola as a primary source of inspiration and a model for all his followers.\n\n==Later developments==\nConcerning the form and plan of the first monastery built near the chapel we have no information, nor is the exact form of the loggia or platforms built round the chapel itself, or of the choir for the brothers built behind it, known. Shortly after 1290, the chapel, which measured only about 5.5 by 3.2&nbsp;m, became entirely inadequate to accommodate the throngs of pilgrims. The altar piece, an ''Annunciation'', was painted by the priest Hilarius of Viterbo in 1393. The monastery was at most the residence, only for a short time, of the ministers-general of the order after St Francis. In 1415 it first became associated with the Regular Observance, in the care of which it remains to the present day. \n[[Image:S.Maria.degli.Angeli17.jpg|thumb|230px|Side view of the Portiuncola.]]\n\n==Decorations of the Porziuncola==\nThis tiny church is exquisitely decorated by artists from different periods. On the fa\u00e7ade, above the entrance outside, is a fresco by [[Johann Friedrich Overbeck]] (1829), depicting St Francis receiving from Christ and the Virgin the indulgence, known as the \u201cPardon of Assisi\u201d. The German painter Overbeck was a member of the [[Nazarene movement]], a group of painters who aimed to revive honesty and spirituality in Christian art. At the base of this fresco is a small rectangular fresco beneath which are the Latin words ''Haec est porta vitae aeternae'' (\"This is the gate to eternal life\").\n[[Image:S.M.degli.Angeli024.jpg|thumb|right|''St Francis receiving the Pardon of Assisi'' by F. Overbeck.]]\nThe outside wall to the right of the entrance shows fragments of two frescoes by unknown Umbrian artists. In the 19th century a door was opened in the same wall, to control the flow of pilgrims. The left outside wall includes the tombstone of [[Pietro Cattani]], who died on 10 March 1221. (St Francis was still alive at the time of his death). At the back, above the entrance, is the fresco ''Crucifixion'' by [[Pietro Vannucci|Perugino]], painted around 1485. It was badly damaged during the construction of the basilica. The 15th century door is decorated with floral motifs. On top of the Porziuncola stands a small Gothic belfry.\n\nThe interior is austere and simple. Some of the rough, squared stones, taken from Mount Subasio, were put in place by the saint himself while repairing this little church. It is decorated in a simple Gothic style with frescoes from the 14th and the 15th century. But the masterpiece is the six-part fresco in the apse of this little church, painted by the priest Ilario da Viterbo (1393): \n*''The Annunciation'' (middle)\n*''St Francis Throws Himself into the Thorny Brambles'' (right)\n*''St Francis Accompanied by Two Angels'' (right)\n*''Apparition of Christ and the Virgin, Accompanied by 60 Angels, with St Francis Offering Roses'' (top)\n*''St Francis imploring pope Honorius III the Confirmation of the Indulgence'' (left)\n*''St Francis Promulgates the Indulgence, Accompanied by the Bishops of Umbria'' (left)\n\nThe pavement on the floor is now restored to its original appearance by the restorations following the earthquake of 1997.\n\n==Basilica of Santa Maria degli Angeli==\n{{Main|Papal Basilica of Saint Mary of the Angels in Assisi}}\nThe buildings which had been gradually added to the shrine were taken down by order of [[Pope Pius V]] (1566\u20131572), except the cell in which St Francis had died, and were replaced by a large basilica in contemporary style. The new edifice was erected over the cell just mentioned and over the Portiuncula chapel, which is situated immediately under the cupola. The [[basilica]], which has three naves and a circle of chapels extending along the entire length of the aisles, was completed (1569\u201378) according to the plans of [[Giacomo Barozzi da Vignola]], assisted by [[Galeazzo Alessi]]. \n\nIn the night of 15 March 1832, the arch of the three naves and of the choir fell in, in consequence of an earthquake, the cupola sporting a big crack. Gregory XVI had all restored in 1836-1840, and on 8 September 1840 the basilica was reconsecrated by Cardinal Lambruschini. By Brief of 11 April 1909, [[Pope Pius X]] raised it to a \"[[Major basilica|patriarchal basilica]] and papal chapel\". The high altar was therefore immediately rebuilt at the expense of the Franciscan province of the Holy Cross (also known as the Saxon province), and a papal throne added. Under the bay of the choir, resting against the columns of the cupola, is still preserved the cell in which St Francis died, while, a little behind the sacristy, is the spot where the saint, during a temptation, is said to have rolled in a briar-bush, which was then changed into thornless roses. During this same night the saint received the Porziuncola Indulgence.\n\n==Feast Day and Portiuncola Indulgence==\nFranciscans continue to celebrate the feast of Our Lady of the Angels of the Porzioncula on August 2,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.calledbymary.org/franciscan-feast-days.html|title=Franciscan Feast Days|website=The Franciscans of Mary the Theotokos|accessdate=19 October 2014}}</ref> which marks the dedication of the church.<ref>[https://www.catholicnewsagency.com/news/friar-lauds-indulgence-as-a-way-to-connect-with-st-francis Bunderson, Carl. \"On Aug. 2, you can get this St. Francis-themed indulgence\", Catholic News agency, August 2, 2013]</ref>\n\nThe '''Porziuncola [[Indulgence]]''' could at first be gained only in the Porziuncola chapel between the afternoon of 1 August and sunset on 2 August.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=1wshYVi3KM4C&pg=RA1-PA246-IA1&lpg=RA1-PA246-IA1&dq=Albert+of+Pisa&source=bl&ots=mxGwNqGdbm&sig=ACfU3U00LUW1A4CWfBTnQgmJk8hAOnEnVw&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjRoPb64uvmAhUOrVkKHcFbDxI4ChDoATABegQICRAB#v=onepage&q=Albert%20of%20Pisa&f=false Arnald of Sarrant. \"The Generalate of Brother Albert of Pisa\", ''Chronicle of the Twenty-Four Generals of the Order of Friars Minor'', (Noel Muscat ofm, trans.) Ordo Fratrum Minorum. Malta, 2010]</ref> On 5 August 1480 (or 1481), [[Pope Sixtus IV]] extended it to all churches of the first and second orders of St Francis for Franciscans. On 4 July 1622, [[Gregory XV]] extended the privilege to all the faithful, who, after confession and the reception of Holy Communion, visited such churches on the appointed day. On 12 October 1622, Gregory XV granted the same privilege to all the churches of the [[Order of Friars Minor Capuchin|Capuchins]]. [[Pope Urban VIII]] granted it for all churches of the regular [[Third Order]] on 13 January 1643, and [[Clement X]] for all churches of the [[Conventuals]] on 3 October 1670.\n\nWhile papal declarations made the Porziuncola Indulgence indisputable from the juridico-canonistic standpoint, its historical authenticity (i.e. origin from St Francis) remains in question. None of the old legends of St Francis mentions the Indulgence, nor does any contemporary document mention it. The oldest document mentioning the Indulgence is a notary's deed of 31 October 1277, in which Blessed [[Benedict of Arezzo]] (whom St Francis himself received into the order) testifies that he had been informed by Brother Masseo (a companion of St Francis) that [[Pope Honorius III]] granted the indulgence at Perugia. Later testimonies include those of [[Jacob Cappoli]] concerning [[Brother Leo]], of [[Oddo of Acquasparta]], [[Peter Zalfani]], [[Peter John Olivi]] (who wrote a scholastic tract defending this indulgence about 1279), [[John of Laverna]], [[Ubertino da Casale]], and [[Francis of Fabriano]] (whose testimony goes back to the year 1268). \n\nLater popes extended the privilege to all churches pertaining in any way to the Franciscan Order, even to churches in which the Third Order held its meetings (even parish churches, etc.), provided that there was no Franciscan church in the district, and that such a church was distant over an Italian mile (1000 paces). Even districts and countries could receive special privileges. \n\n[[Pope Paul VI]] completely reformed the grants of indulgences, after the [[Second Vatican Council]]. His Apostolic Constitution \"Indulgentiarum Doctrina\" (1967), yet again confirmed the Portiuncula Indulgence. According to the Enchiridion Indulgentiarum, Catholic faithful may gain a plenary indulgence on 2 August (the Portiuncula) or on such other day as designated by the local ordinary for the advantage of the faithful, under the usual conditions (sacramental Confession, Holy Communion, and prayer for the intentions of the Supreme Pontiff), by devoutly visiting the parish church, and there reciting at least the Lord's Prayer and the Creed. The Indulgence applies to the cathedral church of the diocese, and to the co-cathedral church (if there is one), even if they are not parochial, and also to quasi-parochial churches. To gain this, as any plenary indulgence, the faithful must be free from any attachment to sin, even venial sin. Where this entire detachment is wanting, the indulgence is partial.<ref name=\"Indulgence\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.franciscanfriarstor.com/archive/stfrancis/stf_portuncula_indulgence.htm|title=The Portiuncula Indulgence|accessdate=2010-10-06|publisher=Franciscan Friars, TOR}}</ref>\n\n==Porziuncola in America==\nIn San Francisco, California, there is a replica of the Porziuncola Chapel.

New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1909. 29 Apr. 2014]</ref>\n\n[[File:Evora66.jpg|thumb|left|The miracle of the Porziuncola; painting by Antonio de Oliveira Bernardes (1698); [[Cathedral of \u00c9vora]], Portugal.]]\nFrancis built himself a small hut near the Chapel of Our Lady of the Angels and was soon joined by others. Here he founded the [[Franciscan]]s. Around 1211 the small chapel was given to Francis by the [[abbot]] of Saint Benedict of Monte Subasio on condition of making it the mother house of his religious family. On Palm Sunday 1211 St Francis received in this church [[Clare of Assisi]] and founded the Second Order of the Poor Ladies [[Poor Clares]]. Adjoining this humble sanctuary, already dear to Francis, the first Franciscan convent was formed by the erection of a few small huts or cells of wattle, straw, and mud, and enclosed by a hedge.<ref name=robinson/>\n\nThe General Chapters, the annual meetings of the friars, were held in this church usually during [[Pentecost]] (months of May \u2013 June).\n\nFeeling his end approaching, St Francis asked to be brought back to the Portiuncola in September 1226. On his death-bed St Francis recommended the chapel to the faithful protection and care of his brethren. He died, in his cell, not fifteen yards from the church, at sunset on Saturday, 3 October 1226. \n\nHowever this may be, here or in this neighbourhood was the cradle of the Franciscan Order. After the death of Francis, the spiritual value and the charisma of the Porziuncola became even greater. St Francis himself pointed out the Portiuncola as a primary source of inspiration and a model for all his followers.\n\n==Later developments==\nConcerning the form and plan of the first monastery built near the chapel we have no information, nor is the exact form of the loggia or platforms built round the chapel itself, or of the choir for the brothers built behind it, known. Shortly after 1290, the chapel, which measured only about 5.5 by 3.2&nbsp;m, became entirely inadequate to accommodate the throngs of pilgrims. The altar piece, an ''Annunciation'', was painted by the priest Hilarius of Viterbo in 1393. The monastery was at most the residence, only for a short time, of the ministers-general of the order after St Francis. In 1415 it first became associated with the Regular Observance, in the care of which it remains to the present day. \n[[Image:S.Maria.degli.Angeli17.jpg|thumb|230px|Side view of the Portiuncola.]]\n\n==Decorations of the Porziuncola==\nThis tiny church is exquisitely decorated by artists from different periods. On the fa\u00e7ade, above the entrance outside, is a fresco by [[Johann Friedrich Overbeck]] (1829), depicting St Francis receiving from Christ and the Virgin the indulgence, known as the \u201cPardon of Assisi\u201d. The German painter Overbeck was a member of the [[Nazarene movement]], a group of painters who aimed to revive honesty and spirituality in Christian art. At the base of this fresco is a small rectangular fresco beneath which are the Latin words ''Haec est porta vitae aeternae'' (\"This is the gate to eternal life\").\n[[Image:S.M.degli.Angeli024.jpg|thumb|right|''St Francis receiving the Pardon of Assisi'' by F. Overbeck.]]\nThe outside wall to the right of the entrance shows fragments of two frescoes by unknown Umbrian artists. In the 19th century a door was opened in the same wall, to control the flow of pilgrims. The left outside wall includes the tombstone of [[Pietro Cattani]], who died on 10 March 1221. (St Francis was still alive at the time of his death). At the back, above the entrance, is the fresco ''Crucifixion'' by [[Pietro Vannucci|Perugino]], painted around 1485. It was badly damaged during the construction of the basilica. The 15th century door is decorated with floral motifs. On top of the Porziuncola stands a small Gothic belfry.\n\nThe interior is austere and simple. Some of the rough, squared stones, taken from Mount Subasio, were put in place by the saint himself while repairing this little church. It is decorated in a simple Gothic style with frescoes from the 14th and the 15th century. But the masterpiece is the six-part fresco in the apse of this little church, painted by the priest Ilario da Viterbo (1393): \n*''The Annunciation'' (middle)\n*''St Francis Throws Himself into the Thorny Brambles'' (right)\n*''St Francis Accompanied by Two Angels'' (right)\n*''Apparition of Christ and the Virgin, Accompanied by 60 Angels, with St Francis Offering Roses'' (top)\n*''St Francis imploring pope Honorius III the Confirmation of the Indulgence'' (left)\n*''St Francis Promulgates the Indulgence, Accompanied by the Bishops of Umbria'' (left)\n\nThe pavement on the floor is now restored to its original appearance by the restorations following the earthquake of 1997.\n\n==Basilica of Santa Maria degli Angeli==\n{{Main|Papal Basilica of Saint Mary of the Angels in Assisi}}\nThe buildings which had been gradually added to the shrine were taken down by order of [[Pope Pius V]] (1566\u20131572), except the cell in which St Francis had died, and were replaced by a large basilica in contemporary style. The new edifice was erected over the cell just mentioned and over the Portiuncula chapel, which is situated immediately under the cupola. The [[basilica]], which has three naves and a circle of chapels extending along the entire length of the aisles, was completed (1569\u201378) according to the plans of [[Giacomo Barozzi da Vignola]], assisted by [[Galeazzo Alessi]]. \n\nIn the night of 15 March 1832, the arch of the three naves and of the choir fell in, in consequence of an earthquake, the cupola sporting a big crack. Gregory XVI had all restored in 1836-1840), and on 8 September 1840, the basilica was reconsecrated by Cardinal Lambruschini. By Brief of 11 April 1909, [[Pope Pius X]] raised it to a \"[[Major basilica|patriarchal basilica]] and papal chapel\". The high altar was therefore immediately rebuilt at the expense of the Franciscan province of the Holy Cross (also known as the Saxon province), and a papal throne added. Under the bay of the choir, resting against the columns of the cupola, is still preserved the cell in which St Francis died, while, a little behind the sacristy, is the spot where the saint, during a temptation, is said to have rolled in a briar-bush, which was then changed into thornless roses. During this same night the saint received the Porziuncola Indulgence.\n\n==Feast Day and Portiuncola Indulgence==\nFranciscans continue to celebrate the feast of Our Lady of the Angels of the Porzioncula on August 2,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.calledbymary.org/franciscan-feast-days.html|title=Franciscan Feast Days|website=The Franciscans of Mary the Theotokos|accessdate=19 October 2014}}</ref> which marks the dedication of the church.<ref>[https://www.catholicnewsagency.com/news/friar-lauds-indulgence-as-a-way-to-connect-with-st-francis Bunderson, Carl. \"On Aug. 2, you can get this St. Francis-themed indulgence\", Catholic News agency, August 2, 2013]</ref>\n\nThe '''Porziuncola [[Indulgence]]''' could at first be gained only in the Porziuncola chapel between the afternoon of 1 August and sunset on 2 August.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=1wshYVi3KM4C&pg=RA1-PA246-IA1&lpg=RA1-PA246-IA1&dq=Albert+of+Pisa&source=bl&ots=mxGwNqGdbm&sig=ACfU3U00LUW1A4CWfBTnQgmJk8hAOnEnVw&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjRoPb64uvmAhUOrVkKHcFbDxI4ChDoATABegQICRAB#v=onepage&q=Albert%20of%20Pisa&f=false Arnald of Sarrant. \"The Generalate of Brother Albert of Pisa\", ''Chronicle of the Twenty-Four Generals of the Order of Friars Minor'', (Noel Muscat ofm, trans.) Ordo Fratrum Minorum. Malta, 2010]</ref> On 5 August 1480 (or 1481), [[Pope Sixtus IV]] extended it to all churches of the first and second orders of St Francis for Franciscans. On 4 July 1622, [[Gregory XV]] extended the privilege to all the faithful, who, after confession and the reception of Holy Communion, visited such churches on the appointed day. On 12 October 1622, Gregory XV granted the same privilege to all the churches of the [[Order of Friars Minor Capuchin|Capuchins]]. [[Pope Urban VIII]] granted it for all churches of the regular [[Third Order]] on 13 January 1643, and [[Clement X]] for all churches of the [[Conventuals]] on 3 October 1670.\n\nWhile papal declarations made the Porziuncola Indulgence indisputable from the juridico-canonistic standpoint, its historical authenticity (i.e. origin from St Francis) remains in question. None of the old legends of St Francis mentions the Indulgence, nor does any contemporary document mention it. The oldest document mentioning the Indulgence is a notary's deed of 31 October 1277, in which Blessed [[Benedict of Arezzo]] (whom St Francis himself received into the order) testifies that he had been informed by Brother Masseo (a companion of St Francis) that [[Pope Honorius III]] granted the indulgence at Perugia. Later testimonies include those of [[Jacob Cappoli]] concerning [[Brother Leo]], of [[Oddo of Acquasparta]], [[Peter Zalfani]], [[Peter John Olivi]] (who wrote a scholastic tract defending this indulgence about 1279), [[John of Laverna]], [[Ubertino da Casale]], and [[Francis of Fabriano]] (whose testimony goes back to the year 1268). \n\nLater popes extended the privilege to all churches pertaining in any way to the Franciscan Order, even to churches in which the Third Order held its meetings (even parish churches, etc.), provided that there was no Franciscan church in the district, and that such a church was distant over an Italian mile (1000 paces). Even districts and countries could receive special privileges. \n\n[[Pope Paul VI]] completely reformed the grants of indulgences, after the [[Second Vatican Council]]. His Apostolic Constitution \"Indulgentiarum Doctrina\" (1967), yet again confirmed the Portiuncula Indulgence. According to the Enchiridion Indulgentiarum, Catholic faithful may gain a plenary indulgence on 2 August (the Portiuncula) or on such other day as designated by the local ordinary for the advantage of the faithful, under the usual conditions (sacramental Confession, Holy Communion, and prayer for the intentions of the Supreme Pontiff), by devoutly visiting the parish church, and there reciting at least the Lord's Prayer and the Creed. The Indulgence applies to the cathedral church of the diocese, and to the co-cathedral church (if there is one), even if they are not parochial, and also to quasi-parochial churches. To gain this, as any plenary indulgence, the faithful must be free from any attachment to sin, even venial sin. Where this entire detachment is wanting, the indulgence is partial.<ref name=\"Indulgence\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.franciscanfriarstor.com/archive/stfrancis/stf_portuncula_indulgence.htm|title=The Portiuncula Indulgence|accessdate=2010-10-06|publisher=Franciscan Friars, TOR}}</ref>\n\n==Porziuncola in America==\nIn San Francisco, California, there is a replica of the Porziuncola Chapel. The Archdiocese of San Francisco built a 78% scale copy of the original chapel in a former gymnasium adjoining the Church of the National Shrine of St Francis of Assisi in The City's North Beach District.
