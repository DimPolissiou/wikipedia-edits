{"title_page": "Mitchelville", "text_new": "{{other uses|Mitchellville (disambiguation)}}\n\n'''Mitchelville''' was a town built during the [[American Civil War]] for escaped slaves, located on [[Hilton Head Island, South Carolina]]. It was named for one of the local [[Union Army]] generals, [[Ormsby M. Mitchel]]. The town was a population center for the enterprise known as the [[Port Royal Experiment]].\n\n==History==\nDuring the first year of the Civil War, on November 7, 1861, Union forces consisting of approximately 60 ships and 20,000 men under the command of [[Union Navy]] Captain [[Samuel F. DuPont]] and Army General [[Thomas W. Sherman]] attacked [[Confederate States Army|Confederate]] forces commanded by [[Brigadier General (CSA)|Brig. Gen.]] [[Thomas F. Drayton]] (a local [[Planter (American South)|planter]]) defending Hilton Head Island at Fort Walker and Fort Beauregard.  By 3:00&nbsp;p.m., the Confederate forces had retreated from the forts; when Union troops landed on Hilton Head Island, they encountered no resistance and discovered that the white inhabitants of the island had already fled to the mainland.<ref>Trinkley/CRC-20 n.d.; CFI 1995; Styer 2003</ref>\n\nHilton Head Island became the Union's southern headquarters for the war and a military supply depot.  Fortifications (such as [[Fort Howell]]), a hospital, barracks, and other utilitarian structures were built for the military, which at times numbered 30,000 men.<ref>Styer 2003</ref> The island was used as a staging ground for the blockading of [[Savannah, Georgia|Savannah]] and [[Charleston, South Carolina|Charleston]].<ref name=\"Trinkley 1986\">Trinkley 1986</ref>\n\nWithin two days of the Union capture of the island, approximately 150 escaped slaves (or those left behind by the Hilton Head Island planters when they fled the island) came to the Union army's encampment; by December 15, approximately 320 escaped slaves had sought refuge at the Union army's encampment.<ref name=\"Trinkley/CRC-20 n.d\">Trinkley/CRC-20 n.d.</ref>  One Union soldier stationed on Hilton Head at the time recounted:\n\n{{quote|Negro slaves came flocking into our camp by the hundreds, escaping their masters when they knew of the landing of \"Linkum sojers\" {{sic}}, as they called us - many of them with no other clothing than [[gunnysack]]s|Trinkley 1986.}}\n\nIn February 1862, there were at least 600 [[Contraband (American Civil War)|contrabands]] living in Union encampments on Hilton Head Island.<ref name=\"CFI 1995\">CFI 1995</ref>\n\nThese escaped slaves were regarded as \"[[contraband]] of war\" or as simply \"contrabands;\" they were not yet technically \"[[freedmen]]\", and the Union army was unsure of what to do with them.  General [[Thomas West Sherman]] repeatedly wrote his superiors in [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]] asking for guidance regarding, and supplies for, the \"contrabands\". Official policy regarding \"contrabands\" varied between Union-occupied areas, a problem which persisted throughout the war.<ref name=\"Trinkley/CRC-20 n.d\"/>\n\nOn February 6, 1862, General Sherman issued General Order 9, which requested assistance for the contrabands from the \"highly favored and philanthropic people\" in the north.  Help came from two sources: from the philanthropic northerners whom Sherman requested assistance from (such as that given by the [[American Missionary Association]]); and from Secretary of the Treasury [[Salmon P. Chase]], who sent his colleague and outspoken opponent of slavery [[Edward L. Pierce]] to Port Royal to examine and eventually oversee the government effort regarding the freed slaves.  Pierce and representatives from the American Missionary Association quickly devised a plan for the education, welfare, and employment of the former slaves.<ref name=\"Trinkley/CRC-20 n.d\"/>  In April 1862, a military order was issued freeing the blacks on the [[Sea Islands]]. On January 1, 1863, President [[Abraham Lincoln]] issued the [[Emancipation Proclamation]], freeing all slaves in the rebellious/Confederate states, which included [[South Carolina]]:\n\n{{quote|The Executive Government of the United States, including the military and naval authority thereof, will recognize and maintain the freedom of such persons, and will do no act or acts to repress such persons, or any of them, in any efforts they may make for their actual freedom ... and I recommend to them that, in all cases when allowed, they labor faithfully for reasonable wages|NARA 2005.}}\n\nMany Union officers complained that the ex-slaves \"were becoming a burden and a nuisance.\"<ref name=\"Trinkley 1986\"/>  Some Union troops stole from the ex-slaves, and it is apparent from primary resources that the racial attitudes of some of the Union troops towards the blacks were negative; General Mitchel remarked that he found \"a feeling prevailing among the officers and soldiers of prejudice against the blacks.\"<ref name=\"Trinkley 1986\"/>  By February 1862, the ex-slaves were living inside the Union camps, in whitewashed, wooden barrack-like structures built specifically for them and under the control of the Quartermaster's Department; similar camps were also built in nearby [[Beaufort, South Carolina|Beaufort]], [[Bay Point (South Carolina)|Bay Point]], and [[Otter Island (South Carolina)|Otter Island]].<ref>Trinkley 1986, Trinkley and Hacker 1987</ref>  But by October 1862, however, Union leaders believed this approach was a failure, as living conditions for the freedmen were substandard and there was a need to separate the soldiers from the ex-slaves, and vice versa:\n\n{{quote|Some wholesome changes are contemplated by the new regime, not the least of which is the removal of the negro quarters beyond the stockade, where they can at once have more comfort and freedom for improvement ...

Mitchel]], Commander of the [[Department of the South]] and headquartered at Hilton Head, decided to develop a town for the escaped slaves. Built in a cotton field on the former [[Drayton Plantation]] and in close proximity to the military camps, it was eventually known as Mitchelville after the commander.  Unlike other contraband camps, Mitchelville was developed as a regular town, with roads, one-quarter-acre lots, elected officials (some officials were appointed by the Union military, however), a church, various laws addressing such issues as community behavior and sanitation, collection of taxes, and a compulsory education law for children between the ages of six and fifteen. This was likely the first such law in the South.<ref name=\"Trinkley/CRC-20 n.d.; CFI 1995\">Trinkley/CRC-20 n.d.; CFI 1995</ref>\n\n[[Image:Mville homes.jpg|thumb|right|\"Refugee quarters\" 1864, Mitchelville]]\n\nBy late November 1862, Federal tax commissioners were able to fix taxes on local plantations, with Fish Hall (Tract No. 3) being assessed as being worth $5,200.00, with $156.00 in taxes owed.  When Thomas Drayton failed to pay the taxes due on the property, it was advertised for sale by the Federal government. The government purchased it, holding it until 1875, when white Democrats regained control of the state legislature shortly before the end of Reconstruction.<ref name=\"Trinkley 1986\"/>\n\nThe town was established by late 1862, and contained about 1,500 residents by November 1865. The residents of Mitchelville supported themselves largely by [[wage labor]] for the military, earning mostly between four dollars and twelve dollars a month, depending on their level of skill. Nearly all of the wage jobs for the residents of Mitchelville ceased when the Union military departed the island in 1868, more than two years after the end of the war. The residents switched to a [[subsistence farming]]-based economy, with many forming farming [[collective]]s, joining together to rent large tracts of land from the government.<ref name=\"Trinkley/CRC-20 n.d.; CFI 1995\"/> Documents show that many of the Hilton Head Island freedmen experienced an extreme shortage of food after the military departed the island.<ref name=\"Trinkley and Hacker 1987\">Trinkley and Hacker 1987</ref>\n\n[[Image:Mville 1864map.jpg|thumb|center|Map of Mitchelville, c. 1860s]]\n\nThe town or village continued relatively intact into the early 1870s. But sometime in the early 1880s, Mitchelville ceased being a true town. It dissolved to a small, kinship-based community that survived into the 1920s. A 1920 [[topographic map]] of Hilton Head Island shows a cluster of buildings centered around a church.  Previous archaeological investigations have concluded that the majority of Mitchelville was abandoned by c. 1890.<ref name=\"Trinkley and Hacker 1987\"/>\n\n===Churches/religion===\nThe [[First Baptist Church (Mitchelville, South Carolina)|First Baptist Church]] was founded in 1862 with 120 members and with the ex-slave [[Abraham Murchison]] as its first minister.  By 1866, there were three churches in Mitchelville&mdash;the First Baptist Church, a [[Free Will Baptist]] church, and a [[Methodist]] church.<ref name=\"Trinkley/CRC-20 n.d\"/>  Several missionary groups were active on Hilton Head Island during the war, but by 1866 all but the American Missionary Association had left the island.  The American Missionary Association was largely funded by the [[Wesleyan Methodist Church (United States)|Wesleyan Methodists]], [[Free Presbyterians]], and Free Will Baptists during the war years. After 1866, it relied on funds from the [[United States Tax Commission]] as northern interest waned in the freedmen on the Sea Islands.<ref name=\"Trinkley/CRC-20 n.d\"/>\n\n===School===\nIn 1866 Hilton Head Island was divided into five school districts: Mitchelville, Marshland, Seabrook, Stoney, and Lawton.  In Mitchelville District, the American Missionary Association supplied most of the teachers, and offered primary, intermediate, and high school classes at the various churches.  There were as many as 238 students being taught in the district at one time, with classes meeting for up to five hours per day.  Attendance varied according to job requirements and travel conditions of the students.  Most teachers were white northerners, but in 1869 there was at least one black assistant teacher, and Sunday school lessons were taught by black teachers around 1870.<ref name=\"Trinkley/CRC-20 n.d\"/> Descendants of the former-slave town of Mitchelville built the [[Cherry Hill School]] in 1937.<ref>{{cite web|title=Cherry Hill School, Beaufort County (210 Dillon Rd., Hilton Head Island)|url=http://www.nationalregister.sc.gov/beaufort/S10817707071/index.htm |work=National Register Properties in South Carolina|publisher=South Carolina Department of Archives and History|accessdate=25 February 2014}}</ref>\n\n===Structures===\nMilitary sawmills provided free lumber for the houses, which were built by the freedmen.  Each house was on a one-quarter-acre lot.  The typical house measured approximately 12x12ft, was of frame construction, had wood pier foundations, glass-paned windows, wood floors, weatherboard siding, wood shingle roofs, and having either metal stoves or brick and/or \"tabby\" or wattle and daub (\"stick\") chimneys.  There were four stores in Mitchelville; several closed down after the military left, perhaps because they had survived by overcharging the residents (supplies sold in Mitchelville were priced nearly 600% higher than those sold by the AMA). (Trinkley/CRC-21 1987).\n\n==Post-Civil War==\n[[United States Congress|Congress]] soon passed laws restoring lands confiscated by the U.S. government to the Southern landowners who had owned the land prior to the Civil War.  In April 1875, the Drayton Plantation lands were returned to the Drayton family.  Unfortunately, the U.S. government failed to plan for the protection and preservation of Mitchelville, and its future looked bleak.  However, the Drayton family was no longer interested in farming the property, and sold the land to anyone who was interested and had money \u2013 including many freedmen.<ref name=\"CFI 1995\"/>\n\nMost, if not all, of the Mitchelville property was purchased by an African-American carpenter, [[March Gardner]].  Gardner was illiterate, but was locally well respected and very successful in his business ventures.  Gardner placed his son, Gabriel, in charge of his Mitchelville properties, which at that time included a [[cotton gin]], [[grist mill]], and store.  Gabriel eventually took advantage of his father, and obtained a deed for the property in his own name instead of his father's; Gabriel then transferred the property deed to his wife and daughter.<ref name=\"CFI 1995\"/>\n<!-- Unsourced image removed: [[image:1918topo_HHI.jpg|thumb|center|Mitchelville area, 1918]] -->\nIn the early 20th century, March Gardner's heirs sued Gabriel Gardner's wife's heirs, claiming that Gabriel Gardner had stolen the property from March and that they were entitled to the property.  The legal papers produced by this court case provide a unique insight into Mitchelville during the period.<ref name=\"CFI 1995\"/>\n\nThe daughter of March Gardner, Emmeline Washington, testified that there were a number of families living at Mitchelville and farming three or {{convert|4|acre|m2|adj=on}} plots of land adjacent to their houses.  The money that was collected from them for rent was used to pay the taxes on the property.  March Gardner had built a cotton house, cotton gin, a steam-powered grist mill, and a shop on the property.  Also named were several late-18th and early-19th century residents of Mitchelville: Scapio Drayton, Bob Washington, Jack Screven, Robert Wiley, John Nesbit, Caesar White, Charles Robins, Charles Perry, Clara Wigfall, Renty Miller, Linda Perry, Stephen Singleton, Joe Williams, Billy Reed, Peter Flowers, Charles Pinckney, and Hannah Williams (Hannah Williams stated that she had bought a house in Mitchelville for $5.00).<ref name=\"CFI 1995\"/>\n\nThe court directed that a survey be made of the Mitchelville property, and the property to be divided between each heir of March and Gabriel Gardner involved in the case, with the cost of the case being divided amongst them.<ref name=\"CFI 1995\"/>\n\nEugenia Heyward redeemed her {{convert|35|acre|m2|adj=on}} property on June 7, 1923; Celia and Gabriel Boston obtained the adjacent tract of property on September 2, 1921.  Linda Perry, Clara Wigfall, and Emmeline Washington also obtained their parcels in 1921.  By 1930, Eugenia Heyward's property was sold for $31.00 by the sheriff to pay a defaulted tax bill of $15.00; the property was purchased by Roy A. Rainey from [[New York (state)|New York]], who was purchasing land on Hilton Head Island for [[hunting]].<ref name=\"CFI 1995\"/>\n\nIn 1890, there were approximately 3,000 African-Americans living on Hilton Head Island; by 1930 there were only about 300 living on the island.<ref name=\"CFI 1995\"/> According to a 2010 estimate approximately 2,766 of the 37,099 year round residents on Hilton Head are African American.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://factfinder2.census.gov/faces/tableservices/jsf/pages/productview.xhtml?src=CF |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-05-18 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140904195603/http://factfinder2.census.gov/faces/tableservices/jsf/pages/productview.xhtml?src=CF |archivedate=2014-09-04 }}</ref>\n\n==References==\n* Trinkley, Michael B., ''Of Freedom Unto All: An Archaeological Examination of the Port Royal Experiment.''

(Trinkley/CRC-21 1987).\n\n==Post-Civil War==\n[[United States Congress|Congress]] soon passed laws restoring lands confiscated by the U.S. government to the Southern landowners who had owned the land prior to the Civil War.  In April 1875, the Drayton Plantation lands were returned to the Drayton family.  Unfortunately, the U.S. government failed to plan for the protection and preservation of Mitchelville, and its future looked bleak.  However, the Drayton family was no longer interested in farming the property, and sold the land to anyone who was interested and had money \u2013 including many freedmen.<ref name=\"CFI 1995\"/>\n\nMost, if not all, of the Mitchelville property was purchased by an African-American carpenter, [[March Gardner]].  Gardner was illiterate, but was locally well respected and very successful in his business ventures.  Gardner placed his son, Gabriel, in charge of his Mitchelville properties, which at that time included a [[cotton gin]], [[grist mill]], and store.  Gabriel eventually took advantage of his father, and obtained a deed for the property in his own name instead of his father's; Gabriel then transferred the property deed to his wife and daughter.<ref name=\"CFI 1995\"/>\n<!-- Unsourced image removed: [[image:1918topo_HHI.jpg|thumb|center|Mitchelville area, 1918]] -->\nIn the early 20th century, March Gardner's heirs sued Gabriel Gardner's wife's heirs, claiming that Gabriel Gardner had stolen the property from March and that they were entitled to the property.  The legal papers produced by this court case provide a unique insight into Mitchelville during the period.<ref name=\"CFI 1995\"/>\n\nThe daughter of March Gardner, Emmeline Washington, testified that there were a number of families living at Mitchelville and farming three or {{convert|4|acre|m2|adj=on}} plots of land adjacent to their houses.  The money that was collected from them for rent was used to pay the taxes on the property.  March Gardner had built a cotton house, cotton gin, a steam-powered grist mill, and a shop on the property.  Also named were several late-18th and early-19th century residents of Mitchelville: Scapio Drayton, Bob Washington, Jack Screven, Robert Wiley, John Nesbit, Caesar White, Charles Robins, Charles Perry, Clara Wigfall, Renty Miller, Linda Perry, Stephen Singleton, Joe Williams, Billy Reed, Peter Flowers, Charles Pinckney, and Hannah Williams (Hannah Williams stated that she had bought a house in Mitchelville for $5.00).<ref name=\"CFI 1995\"/>\n\nThe court directed that a survey be made of the Mitchelville property, and the property to be divided between each heir of March and Gabriel Gardner involved in the case, with the cost of the case being divided amongst them.<ref name=\"CFI 1995\"/>\n\nEugenia Heyward redeemed her {{convert|35|acre|m2|adj=on}} property on June 7, 1923; Celia and Gabriel Boston obtained the adjacent tract of property on September 2, 1921.  Linda Perry, Clara Wigfall, and Emmeline Washington also obtained their parcels in 1921.  By 1930, Eugenia Heyward's property was sold for $31.00 by the sheriff to pay a defaulted tax bill of $15.00; the property was purchased by Roy A. Rainey from [[New York (state)|New York]], who was purchasing land on Hilton Head Island for [[hunting]].<ref name=\"CFI 1995\"/>\n\nIn 1890, there were approximately 3,000 African-Americans living on Hilton Head Island; by 1930 there were only about 300 living on the island.<ref name=\"CFI 1995\"/> According to a 2010 estimate approximately 2,766 of the 37,099 year round residents on Hilton Head are African American.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://factfinder2.census.gov/faces/tableservices/jsf/pages/productview.xhtml?src=CF |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-05-18 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140904195603/http://factfinder2.census.gov/faces/tableservices/jsf/pages/productview.xhtml?src=CF |archivedate=2014-09-04 }}</ref>\n\n==References==\n* Trinkley, Michael B., ''Of Freedom Unto All: An Archaeological Examination of the Port Royal Experiment.''

It does not include vampires originating in folklore or mythology, or the concept of [[dhampir]]s, hybrid or half-vampires.\n\n{{TOC right}}\n\n==Literary==\n<!--*****JUST FOR CHARACTERS FOUND IN BOOKS*****-->\n\n<!--*****\nGuidelines:\n\nPlease post in alphabetical order! Once each list gets long enough, feel free to add sub-headings for each letter for easier navigation. Include ranges if not all letters are covered (i.e. X-Z). Unless a character's title is specifically part of their name (i.e. Count von Count of Sesame Street) or Count is used in the name of the character's corresponding Wiki article (i.e. Count Dracula), please refrain from listing the title when adding an entry, but rather place them alphabetically sans titles.\n\nThis article is a list, please do not break from the format when adding examples. Each entry's respective articles should provide any explanation if needed, as such there is no reason to post summaries. If you feel a need to justify your entry, include it in comments following your edit so you can alert future editors as to your reasoning without disrupting the flow of the article.\n\nMake sure to always include both the character and the work of fiction the character is from. If it is the case that the character appears in more than one category, make sure to link to the correct page. For example, D from Vampire Hunter D is currently in every category but each fiction link is to the telcorresponding version's (literary, film, manga, video game, etc.) correct wiki article. If separate articles for medium do not exist, link to the main series or character article.\n\nThanks.\n***** -->\n\n===A===\n<!--*****JUST FOR CHARACTERS FOUND IN BOOKS*****-->\n\n{{anchor|Literary A}}\n* Aaron Darnell (''[[Women of the Otherworld]]'')\n* Abby Bennett Wilson (''[[The Vampire Diaries]]'')\n* Addh\u00e9ma ([[Paul F\u00e9val, p\u00e8re|F\u00e9val]]'s ''La Vampire'')\n* [[List of Vampire Academy characters#Adrian Ivashkov|Adrian Ivashkov]] (''[[Vampire Academy]]'')\n* [[The Vampire Chronicles|Akasha]] (''[[The Vampire Chronicles]]'')\n* Alan Raby (''[[The Phantom (play)|The Phantom]]'')\n* [[List of Twilight characters#The Volturi|Alec]] (''[[Twilight (novel series)|Twilight]]'' series)\n* Alexander Sterling (''[[Vampire Kisses]]'')\n* [[Akivasha]] (books and stories by [[Robert E.

Once each list gets long enough, feel free to add sub-headings for each letter for easier navigation. Include ranges if not all letters are covered (i.e. X-Z). Unless a character's title is specifically part of their name (i.e. Count von Count of Sesame Street) or Count is used in the name of the character's corresponding Wiki article (i.e. Count Dracula), please refrain from listing the title when adding an entry, but rather place them alphabetically sans titles.\n\nThis article is a list, please do not break from the format when adding examples. Each entry's respective articles should provide any explanation if needed, as such there is no reason to post summaries. If you feel a need to justify your entry, include it in comments following your edit so you can alert future editors as to your reasoning without disrupting the flow of the article.\n\nMake sure to always include both the character and the work of fiction the character is from. If it is the case that the character appears in more than one category, make sure to link to the correct page. For example, D from Vampire Hunter D is currently in every category but each fiction link is to the corresponding version's (literary, film, manga, video game, etc.) correct wiki article. If separate articles for medium do not exist, link to the main series or character article.\n\nThanks.\n***** -->\n\n\n\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n! Role\n! Title\n! Notes\n!

Once each list gets long enough, feel free to add sub-headings for each letter for easier navigation. Include ranges if not all letters are covered (i.e. X-Z). Unless a characters' title is specifically part of their name (i.e. Count von Count of Sesame Street) or Count is used in the name of the character's corresponding Wiki article (i.e. Count Dracula), please refrain from listing the title when adding an entry, but rather place them alphabetically sans titles.\n\nThis article is a list, please do not break from the format when adding examples. Each entry's respective articles should provide any explanation if needed, as such there is no reason to post summaries. If you feel a need to justify your entry, include it in comments following your edit so you can alert future editors as to your reasoning without disrupting the flow of the article.\n\nMake sure to always include both the character and the work of fiction the character is from. If it is the case that the character appears in more than one category, make sure to link to the correct page. For example, D from Vampire Hunter D is currently in every category but each fiction link is to the corresponding version's (literary, film, manga, video game, etc.) correct wiki article.

Once each list gets long enough, feel free to add sub-headings for each letter for easier navigation. Include ranges if not all letters are covered (i.e. X-Z). Unless a character's title is specifically part of their name (i.e. Count von Count of Sesame Street) or Count is used in the name of the character's corresponding Wiki article (i.e. Count Dracula), please refrain from listing the title when adding an entry, but rather place them alphabetically sans titles.\n\nThis article is a list, please do not break from the format when adding examples. Each entry's respective articles should provide any explanation if needed, as such there is no reason to post summaries. If you feel a need to justify your entry, include it in comments following your edit so you can alert future editors as to your reasoning without disrupting the flow of the article.\n\nMake sure to always include both the character and the work of fiction the character is from. If it is the case that the character appears in more than one category, make sure to link to the correct page.

Developed by [[William Glasser]] in the 1960s, RT differs from conventional [[psychiatry]], [[psychoanalysis]] and medical model schools of [[psychotherapy]] in that it focuses on what Glasser calls psychiatry's three Rs: realism, responsibility, and right-and-wrong, rather than symptoms of [[mental disorder]]s.<ref>{{cite book|last=Glasser|first=William|title=Reality therapy. A new approach to psychiatry|url=https://archive.org/details/realitytherapyne00glas|url-access=registration|year=1965|publisher=Harper & Row|location=New York}}</ref> Reality therapy maintains that the individual is suffering from a socially universal human condition rather than a mental illness. It is in the unsuccessful attainment of basic needs that a person's behavior moves away from the norm.  Since fulfilling essential needs is part of a person's present life, reality therapy does not concern itself with a client's past. Neither does this type of therapy deal with unconscious mental processes.<ref name=Lane>Lane, Lara Lynn. \"Reality therapy\". ''Encyclopedia of Psychology''. FindArticles.com. 24 Octoctober 2011. ''Gale Encyclopedia of Psychology'', 2nd ed. Gale Group, 2001.</ref>\n:) :) :) ;)\nThe reality therapy approach to counseling and problem-solving focuses on the here-and-now actions of the client and the ability to create and choose a better future. Typically, clients seek to discover what they really want and how they are currently choosing to behave in order to achieve these goals.  According to Glasser, the social component of psychological disorders has been highly overlooked in the rush to label the population as sick or mentally ill.<ref name=Corey>Corey, G. (2009). Theory and practice of counseling and psychotherapy. Belmont, Calif: Thomson Brooks/Cole.</ref> If a social problem causes distress to a person, it is not always because of a labelled sickness, it may sometimes just be the inability of the satisfaction of one\u0092s psychological needs. Reality therapy attempts to separate the client from the behavior.<ref name=\"Glasser 1985\">Glasser, W. (1985). Take effective control of your life. New York, NY [u.a.: Harper & Row.</ref>\n\n== History ==\nReality therapy was developed at the Veterans Administration hospital in [[Los Angeles]] in the early 1960s by William Glasser and his mentor and teacher, psychiatrist G. L. Harrington. In 1965, Glasser published the book ''Reality Therapy'' in the [[United States]]. The term refers to a process that is people-friendly and people-centered and has nothing to do with giving people a dose of reality (as a threat or punishment), but rather helps people to recognize how fantasy can distract them from their choices they control in life.  Glasser posits that the past is not something to be dwelled upon but rather to be resolved and moved past in order to live a more fulfilling and rewarding life.<ref name=\"Glasser 1981\">Glasser, W. (1981). ''Stations of the mind: new directions for reality therapy''. New York: Harper & Row.</ref>\nBy the 1970s, the concepts were extended into what Glasser then called \"[[Glasser's control theory|control theory]]\", a term used in the title of several of his books. By the mid-1990s, the still evolving concepts were described as \"[[Glasser's choice theory|choice theory]]\", a term conceived and proposed by the Irish reality therapy practitioner Christine O'Brien Shanahan at the 1995 IRTI Conference in Waterford, [[Ireland]] and subsequently adopted by Glasser. The practice of reality therapy remains a cornerstone of the larger body of his work.  Choice theory asserts that each of us is a self-determining being who can choose (many of our) future behaviors and hold ourselves consciously responsible for how we are acting, thinking, feeling, and also for our physiological states.  Choice theory attempts to explain, or give an account of, how each of us attempts to control our world and those within that world.\n\n== Approach ==\nAccording to Glasser, human beings have four basic psychological needs after survival:<ref name=\"Glasser 1998\">Glasser, W. (1998). ''Choice theory: a new psychology of personal freedom''. New York: HarperCollins.</ref> the most important need being to love and be loved by another person or group for a feeling of belonging;  the need for power, through learning, achieving, feeling worthwhile, winning and through being competent;  the need for freedom, including independence and autonomy while simultaneously exercising personal responsibility;  the need for fun, pleasure seeking enjoyment and relaxation is also a very important need for good psychological health.\n\nOne of the core principles of reality therapy is that, whether people are aware of it or not, they are always trying to meet these essential human needs. These needs must all be balanced and met for a person to function most effectively.  However, people don't necessarily act effectively at achieving these goals. Socializing with others is one effective way of meeting the need to belong. But how a person chooses to interact with and gain attention and love from others is most often at the root of their psychological dismay. Reality therapy stresses one major point\u2014people are in control of what they are currently doing in their lives whether or not it is working in their favor toward meeting their basic psychological needs for power, belonging, fun and freedom. And it is through an individual's choices that he or she makes change happen for the better or worse.<ref name=\"Glasser 1998\"/>\n\nIn our current society, the survival need is normally being met\u2014it is then in how people meet the remaining four psychological needs that they typically run into trouble. Reality therapy holds that the key to behavior is to remain aware of what an individual presently wants and make choices that will ensure that goal. Reality therapy maintains that what really drives human beings is their need to belong and to be loved. What also drives humans is their yearnings to be free, and with that freedom comes great responsibility (one cannot exist without the other). Reality therapy is very much a therapy of decision (or [[choice]]) and change, based upon the conviction that, even though human persons often have let themselves become products of their past's powerful influences, they need not be held forever hostage by those earlier influences.\n\n==Role played by the therapist==\n\nReality therapy seeks to treat patients who face difficulty in working out a relationship with others. So, the formation of a connection of the patient with the therapist is regarded as an important milestone at the start of the therapy. According to the therapists, bonding of the patients with their therapists is the most crucial dynamic that would facilitate the healing process. As soon as this bonding is stable, it can help to form a fulfilling connection outside the therapeutic environment.  \n\nPatients receiving this kind of therapeutic treatment will learn various ways to strengthen relationships in the most suitable manner possible and that too in the absence of their therapists' safe relationship. Moreover, they will be able to use their newfound skills in their personal lives. \n\nReality therapists say that when patients are able to use the skills, behaviors, actions, and methods learned through the therapy in their personal lives, then they will be able to successfully work out external relationships as well. This will provide them with the satisfaction of leading a more fulfilling life.<ref>[[#http://www.goodtherapy.org/learn-about-therapy/types/reality-therapy|\"Reality therapy\"]]. Retrieved 15 February 2016.</ref>\n\n==Core ideas==\n\n===Action===\nGlasser believes that there are five basic needs of all human beings: survival, love and belonging, power, freedom or independence, and fun. Reality therapy maintains that the biggest reason a person is in pain and acting out is because he/she lacks that one important 'other being' to connect with. Glasser believes the need for love and belonging is the primary need because we need other people in order to satisfy all the other needs.<ref name=Corey/> Therefore, in a cooperative therapeutic relationship, the therapist must create an environment where it is possible for the client to feel connected to another 'responsible' person (the therapist) that they actually like and would actually choose as a friend in their real life.\n\nReality therapy maintains that the core problem of psychological distress is that one or more of the client's essential needs are not being met thereby causing the client to act irresponsibly. The therapist then addresses this issue and asserts that the client assume responsibility for their behavior. Reality therapy holds that we learn responsibility through involvement with other responsible people. We can learn and re-learn responsibility at any time in life\".<ref name=Lane/>  The therapist then focuses on realistic goals in order to remedy the real life issues that are causing discomfort.\n\nWilliam Glasser's choice theory is composed of four aspects;  thinking, acting, feeling, and physiology. We can directly choose our thoughts and our actions; we have great difficulty in directly choosing our feelings and our physiology (sweaty palms, headaches, nervous tics, racing pulse, etc.).<ref name=\"Glasser 1998\"/>\n\nEmotions (feelings) are the client's self-evaluation is a critical and crucial first step. A self-realization that something must change, realization and acceptance that change is, in fact, possible, leads to a plan for making better choices\u2014plans that are at the heart of successful reality therapy. The therapist helps the client create a workable plan to reach a goal. It must be the client's plan, not the counselor's. The essence of a workable plan is that the client can implement it\u2014it is based on factor under the client's control.  Reality therapy strives to empower people by emphasizing the power of doing what is under their control. ''Doing'' is at the heart of reality therapy.\n\n===Behavior===\n\nBehavior, in the real world is an immediate and alive source of information about how we are doing and whether we are happy with what is going on in our lives.  However, it is very hard to choose and to change our emotions directly.  It is easier to change our thinking\u2014to decide, for example, that we will no longer think of ourselves as victims or to decide that in our thoughts we will concentrate on what we can do rather than what we think everybody else ought to do.  Reality therapists approach changing \"what we do\" as a key to changing how we feel and how we will work to obtain what we want. These ideas are similar to those in other therapy movements such as [[Re-evaluation Counseling]] and [[person-centered psychotherapy]], although the former emphasizes emotional release as a method of clearing emotional hurt.\n\n===Control===\nControl is a key issue in reality therapy. Human beings need control to meet their needs: one person seeks control through position and money, and another wants to control their physical space.<ref name=\"Glasser 1981\"/> Control gets a client into trouble in two primary ways: when he or she tries to control other people, and when he or she uses drugs and alcohol to give him or her a false sense of control. At the very heart of choice theory is the core belief that the only person the client can really control is him or herself. If the client thinks he or she can control others, then he or she is moving in the direction of frustration. If the client thinks others can control him or her and follows up by blaming them for all that goes on in his or her life, then he or she tends to do nothing and heads for frustration. There may be events that happen to the client which is out of his or her control, but ultimately, it is up to the client to choose how to respond to these events. Trying to control other people is a vain naive hope, from the point of view of reality therapy. It is a never-ending battle which alienates the client from others and causes endless pain and frustration. This is why it is vital for the client to stick to what is in his or her own control and to respect the rights of other people to meet their needs. The client can, of course, get an instant sense of control from alcohol and some other drugs. This method of control, however, is false, and skews the true level of control the client has over him or herself. This creates an inconsistent level of control which creates even more dissonance and frustration.\n\n===Focus on the present===\nWhile traditional psycho-analysis and counseling often focus on past events, reality therapy and choice theory solutions lay in the present and the future. Practitioners of reality therapy may visit the past but never dwell on it. In reality therapy, the past is seen as the source of the client's wants and his or her ways of behaving, not as a cause.  A client's 'Quality World' is examined as to what this person wants in his life and is it realistic. Supposedly each person from birth has taken pictures or stored mental images that he wants in his Quality World.  Also, each person strives to attain these things that have given pleasure in the past.  Everyone's quality world is different, so naturally  when people enter into a relationship their quality world most likely will not match up with their new partner.<ref name=Lane/>\n\n==Process==\n\n===Involvement===\nEstablishing a relationship with the client is believed to be the most important factor in all types of therapy. Without this relationship, the other steps will not be effective. This is also known as developing a good rapport with the client.  In extreme cases, the therapist may be the only person in the client's life who is willing to put up with the client's behavior long enough to establish a relationship, which can require a great deal of patience from the therapist. In other cases, the client is a part of many relationships, but just needs a relationship with a more consistently positive emphasis.  According to Glasser, the client needs to feel that the therapist is someone that he would want in his \"Quality World\".<ref name=\"Glasser 1981\"/>\n\n===Evaluating current behavior===\nThe therapist must emphasize the here and now with the client, focusing on the current behaviors and attitudes. The therapist asks the client to make a value judgment about his or her current behavior (which presumably is not beneficial, otherwise the client may not have negative consequences from behavior motivating enough to seek therapy). In many cases the therapist must press the client to examine the effects of his or her behavior, but it is important that the judgment be made by the client and not the therapist.  According to Glasser, it is important for the client to feel that he is in control of his own life.<ref name=\"Glasser 1985\"/>\n\n===Planning possible behavior===\nPlan some behavior that is likely to work better. The client is likely to need some suggestions and prompting from the therapist, but it helps if the plan itself comes from the client. It is important that the initial steps be small enough that the client is almost certain to succeed, in order to build confidence.\nIn many cases, the client's problem is the result of a bad relationship with someone, and since the client cannot change anyone else's behavior, the therapist will focus on things the client can do unilaterally. The client may be concerned that the other person will take advantage of this and not [[Reciprocity (social psychology)|reciprocate]], but in most cases a change in behavior will ease the tension enough that the other person also backs off. If this does not happen, the therapist will also encourage the client to build more positive relationships with other people. The relationship with the therapist sustains the client long enough for them to establish these other relationships.<ref name=\"Glasser 1972\">Glasser, W. (1972). ''The Identity Society''. {{ISBN|0-601-15726-5}}</ref>\n\n===Commitment to the plan===\nThe participant must make a commitment to carry out the plan. This is important because many clients will do things for the therapist that they would not do just for themselves. In some cases it can be helpful to make the commitment in writing.<ref>Glasser, W. (1980). What Are You Doing? How People Are Helped by Reality Therapy. {{ISBN|0-06-090947-1}}.</ref>\n\n===\"No Excuses, No Punishment, Never Give Up\"===\nIf there is no punishment, then there is no reason to accept excuses (note that [[punishment]] can be ineffective with clients who expect to fail, see [[Learned helplessness]]). The therapist insists that the client either carries out the plan, or comes up with a more feasible plan. If the therapist maintains a good relationship with the client, it can be very hard to resist carrying out a plan that the client has agreed would be feasible. If the plan is too ambitious for the client's current abilities, then the therapist and the client work out a different plan.<ref name=\"Glasser 1972\"/>\n\n==Principles==\nThere are several basic principles of reality therapy that must be applied to make this technique most successful.<ref name=Wubbolding/>\n\n*Focus on the present and avoid discussing the past because all human problems are caused by unsatisfying present [[Interpersonal relationship|relationship]]s.\n*Avoid discussing [[symptoms]] and complaints as much as possible since these are often the ineffective ways that clients choose to deal with (and hold on to) unsatisfying relationships.\n*Understand the concept of total behavior, which means focus on what clients can do, directly act, and think.\n*Spend less time on what they cannot do directly such as changing their feelings and [[physiology]].

Developed by [[William Glasser]] in the 1960s, RT differs from conventional [[psychiatry]], [[psychoanalysis]] and medical model schools of [[psychotherapy]] in that it focuses on what Glasser calls psychiatry's three Rs: realism, responsibility, and right-and-wrong, rather than symptoms of [[mental disorder]]s.<ref>{{cite book|last=Glasser|first=William|title=Reality therapy. A new approach to psychiatry|url=https://archive.org/details/realitytherapyne00glas|url-access=registration|year=1965|publisher=Harper & Row|location=New York}}</ref> Reality therapy maintains that the individual is suffering from a socially universal human condition rather than a mental illness. It is in the unsuccessful attainment of basic needs that a person's behavior moves away from the norm.  Since fulfilling essential needs is part of a person's present life, reality therapy does not concern itself with a client's past. Neither does this type of therapy deal with unconscious mental processes.<ref name=Lane>Lane, Lara Lynn. \"Reality therapy\". ''Encyclopedia of Psychology''. FindArticles.com. 24 Octoctober 2011. ''Gale Encyclopedia of Psychology'', 2nd ed. Gale Group, 2001.</ref>\n\nThe reality therapy approach to counseling and problem-solving focuses on the here-and-now actions of the client and the ability to create and choose a better future. Typically, clients seek to discover what they really want and how they are currently choosing to behave in order to achieve these goals.  According to Glasser, the social component of psychological disorders has been highly overlooked in the rush to label the population as sick or mentally ill.<ref name=Corey>Corey, G. (2009). Theory and practice of counseling and psychotherapy. Belmont, Calif: Thomson Brooks/Cole.</ref> If a social problem causes distress to a person, it is not always because of a labelled sickness, it may sometimes just be the inability of the satisfaction of one\u0092s psychological needs. Reality therapy attempts to separate the client from the behavior.<ref name=\"Glasser 1985\">Glasser, W. (1985). Take effective control of your life. New York, NY [u.a.: Harper & Row.</ref>\n\n== History ==\nReality therapy was developed at the Veterans Administration hospital in [[Los Angeles]] in the early 1960s by William Glasser and his mentor and teacher, psychiatrist G. L. Harrington. In 1965, Glasser published the book ''Reality Therapy'' in the [[United States]]. The term refers to a process that is people-friendly and people-centered and has nothing to do with giving people a dose of reality (as a threat or punishment), but rather helps people to recognize how fantasy can distract them from their choices they control in life.  Glasser posits that the past is not something to be dwelled upon but rather to be resolved and moved past in order to live a more fulfilling and rewarding life.<ref name=\"Glasser 1981\">Glasser, W. (1981). ''Stations of the mind: new directions for reality therapy''. New York: Harper & Row.</ref>\nBy the 1970s, the concepts were extended into what Glasser then called \"[[Glasser's control theory|control theory]]\", a term used in the title of several of his books. By the mid-1990s, the still evolving concepts were described as \"[[Glasser's choice theory|choice theory]]\", a term conceived and proposed by the Irish reality therapy practitioner Christine O'Brien Shanahan at the 1995 IRTI Conference in Waterford, [[Ireland]] and subsequently adopted by Glasser. The practice of reality therapy remains a cornerstone of the larger body of his work.  Choice theory asserts that each of us is a self-determining being who can choose (many of our) future behaviors and hold ourselves consciously responsible for how we are acting, thinking, feeling, and also for our physiological states.  Choice theory attempts to explain, or give an account of, how each of us attempts to control our world and those within that world.\n\n== Approach ==\nAccording to Glasser, human beings have four basic psychological needs after survival:<ref name=\"Glasser 1998\">Glasser, W. (1998). ''Choice theory: a new psychology of personal freedom''. New York: HarperCollins.</ref> the most important need being to love and be loved by another person or group for a feeling of belonging;  the need for power, through learning, achieving, feeling worthwhile, winning and through being competent;  the need for freedom, including independence and autonomy while simultaneously exercising personal responsibility;  the need for fun, pleasure seeking enjoyment and relaxation is also a very important need for good psychological health.\n\nOne of the core principles of reality therapy is that, whether people are aware of it or not, they are always trying to meet these essential human needs. These needs must all be balanced and met for a person to function most effectively.  However, people don't necessarily act effectively at achieving these goals. Socializing with others is one effective way of meeting the need to belong. But how a person chooses to interact with and gain attention and love from others is most often at the root of their psychological dismay. Reality therapy stresses one major point\u2014people are in control of what they are currently doing in their lives whether or not it is working in their favor toward meeting their basic psychological needs for power, belonging, fun and freedom. And it is through an individual's choices that he or she makes change happen for the better or worse.<ref name=\"Glasser 1998\"/>\n\nIn our current society, the survival need is normally being met\u2014it is then in how people meet the remaining four psychological needs that they typically run into trouble. Reality therapy holds that the key to behavior is to remain aware of what an individual presently wants and make choices that will ensure that goal. Reality therapy maintains that what really drives human beings is their need to belong and to be loved. What also drives humans is their yearnings to be free, and with that freedom comes great responsibility (one cannot exist without the other). Reality therapy is very much a therapy of decision (or [[choice]]) and change, based upon the conviction that, even though human persons often have let themselves become products of their past's powerful influences, they need not be held forever hostage by those earlier influences.\n\n==Role played by the therapist==\n\nReality therapy seeks to treat patients who face difficulty in working out a relationship with others. So, the formation of a connection of the patient with the therapist is regarded as an important milestone at the start of the therapy. According to the therapists, bonding of the patients with their therapists is the most crucial dynamic that would facilitate the healing process. As soon as this bonding is stable, it can help to form a fulfilling connection outside the therapeutic environment.  \n\nPatients receiving this kind of therapeutic treatment will learn various ways to strengthen relationships in the most suitable manner possible and that too in the absence of their therapists' safe relationship. Moreover, they will be able to use their newfound skills in their personal lives. \n\nReality therapists say that when patients are able to use the skills, behaviors, actions, and methods learned through the therapy in their personal lives, then they will be able to successfully work out external relationships as well. This will provide them with the satisfaction of leading a more fulfilling life.<ref>[[#http://www.goodtherapy.org/learn-about-therapy/types/reality-therapy|\"Reality therapy\"]]. Retrieved 15 February 2016.</ref>\n\n==Core ideas==\n\n===Action===\nGlasser believes that there are five basic needs of all human beings: survival, love and belonging, power, freedom or independence, and fun. Reality therapy maintains that the biggest reason a person is in pain and acting out is because he/she lacks that one important 'other being' to connect with. Glasser believes the need for love and belonging is the primary need because we need other people in order to satisfy all the other needs.<ref name=Corey/> Therefore, in a cooperative therapeutic relationship, the therapist must create an environment where it is possible for the client to feel connected to another 'responsible' person (the therapist) that they actually like and would actually choose as a friend in their real life.\n\nReality therapy maintains that the core problem of psychological distress is that one or more of the client's essential needs are not being met thereby causing the client to act irresponsibly. The therapist then addresses this issue and asserts that the client assume responsibility for their behavior. Reality therapy holds that we learn responsibility through involvement with other responsible people. We can learn and re-learn responsibility at any time in life\".<ref name=Lane/>  The therapist then focuses on realistic goals in order to remedy the real life issues that are causing discomfort.\n\nWilliam Glasser's choice theory is composed of four aspects;  thinking, acting, feeling, and physiology. We can directly choose our thoughts and our actions; we have great difficulty in directly choosing our feelings and our physiology (sweaty palms, headaches, nervous tics, racing pulse, etc.).<ref name=\"Glasser 1998\"/>\n\nEmotions (feelings) are the client's self-evaluation is a critical and crucial first step. A self-realization that something must change, realization and acceptance that change is, in fact, possible, leads to a plan for making better choices\u2014plans that are at the heart of successful reality therapy. The therapist helps the client create a workable plan to reach a goal. It must be the client's plan, not the counselor's. The essence of a workable plan is that the client can implement it\u2014it is based on factor under the client's control.  Reality therapy strives to empower people by emphasizing the power of doing what is under their control. ''Doing'' is at the heart of reality therapy.\n\n===Behavior===\n\nBehavior, in the real world is an immediate and alive source of information about how we are doing and whether we are happy with what is going on in our lives.  However, it is very hard to choose and to change our emotions directly.  It is easier to change our thinking\u2014to decide, for example, that we will no longer think of ourselves as victims or to decide that in our thoughts we will concentrate on what we can do rather than what we think everybody else ought to do.  Reality therapists approach changing \"what we do\" as a key to changing how we feel and how we will work to obtain what we want. These ideas are similar to those in other therapy movements such as [[Re-evaluation Counseling]] and [[person-centered psychotherapy]], although the former emphasizes emotional release as a method of clearing emotional hurt.\n\n===Control===\nControl is a key issue in reality therapy. Human beings need control to meet their needs: one person seeks control through position and money, and another wants to control their physical space.<ref name=\"Glasser 1981\"/> Control gets a client into trouble in two primary ways: when he or she tries to control other people, and when he or she uses drugs and alcohol to give him or her a false sense of control. At the very heart of choice theory is the core belief that the only person the client can really control is him or herself. If the client thinks he or she can control others, then he or she is moving in the direction of frustration. If the client thinks others can control him or her and follows up by blaming them for all that goes on in his or her life, then he or she tends to do nothing and heads for frustration. There may be events that happen to the client which is out of his or her control, but ultimately, it is up to the client to choose how to respond to these events. Trying to control other people is a vain naive hope, from the point of view of reality therapy. It is a never-ending battle which alienates the client from others and causes endless pain and frustration. This is why it is vital for the client to stick to what is in his or her own control and to respect the rights of other people to meet their needs. The client can, of course, get an instant sense of control from alcohol and some other drugs. This method of control, however, is false, and skews the true level of control the client has over him or herself. This creates an inconsistent level of control which creates even more dissonance and frustration.\n\n===Focus on the present===\nWhile traditional psycho-analysis and counseling often focus on past events, reality therapy and choice theory solutions lay in the present and the future. Practitioners of reality therapy may visit the past but never dwell on it. In reality therapy, the past is seen as the source of the client's wants and his or her ways of behaving, not as a cause.  A client's 'Quality World' is examined as to what this person wants in his life and is it realistic. Supposedly each person from birth has taken pictures or stored mental images that he wants in his Quality World.  Also, each person strives to attain these things that have given pleasure in the past.  Everyone's quality world is different, so naturally  when people enter into a relationship their quality world most likely will not match up with their new partner.<ref name=Lane/>\n\n==Process==\n\n===Involvement===\nEstablishing a relationship with the client is believed to be the most important factor in all types of therapy. Without this relationship, the other steps will not be effective. This is also known as developing a good rapport with the client.  In extreme cases, the therapist may be the only person in the client's life who is willing to put up with the client's behavior long enough to establish a relationship, which can require a great deal of patience from the therapist. In other cases, the client is a part of many relationships, but just needs a relationship with a more consistently positive emphasis.  According to Glasser, the client needs to feel that the therapist is someone that he would want in his \"Quality World\".<ref name=\"Glasser 1981\"/>\n\n===Evaluating current behavior===\nThe therapist must emphasize the here and now with the client, focusing on the current behaviors and attitudes. The therapist asks the client to make a value judgment about his or her current behavior (which presumably is not beneficial, otherwise the client may not have negative consequences from behavior motivating enough to seek therapy). In many cases the therapist must press the client to examine the effects of his or her behavior, but it is important that the judgment be made by the client and not the therapist.  According to Glasser, it is important for the client to feel that he is in control of his own life.<ref name=\"Glasser 1985\"/>\n\n===Planning possible behavior===\nPlan some behavior that is likely to work better. The client is likely to need some suggestions and prompting from the therapist, but it helps if the plan itself comes from the client. It is important that the initial steps be small enough that the client is almost certain to succeed, in order to build confidence.\nIn many cases, the client's problem is the result of a bad relationship with someone, and since the client cannot change anyone else's behavior, the therapist will focus on things the client can do unilaterally. The client may be concerned that the other person will take advantage of this and not [[Reciprocity (social psychology)|reciprocate]], but in most cases a change in behavior will ease the tension enough that the other person also backs off. If this does not happen, the therapist will also encourage the client to build more positive relationships with other people. The relationship with the therapist sustains the client long enough for them to establish these other relationships.<ref name=\"Glasser 1972\">Glasser, W. (1972). ''The Identity Society''. {{ISBN|0-601-15726-5}}</ref>\n\n===Commitment to the plan===\nThe participant must make a commitment to carry out the plan. This is important because many clients will do things for the therapist that they would not do just for themselves. In some cases it can be helpful to make the commitment in writing.<ref>Glasser, W. (1980). What Are You Doing? How People Are Helped by Reality Therapy. {{ISBN|0-06-090947-1}}.</ref>\n\n===\"No Excuses, No Punishment, Never Give Up\"===\nIf there is no punishment, then there is no reason to accept excuses (note that [[punishment]] can be ineffective with clients who expect to fail, see [[Learned helplessness]]). The therapist insists that the client either carries out the plan, or comes up with a more feasible plan. If the therapist maintains a good relationship with the client, it can be very hard to resist carrying out a plan that the client has agreed would be feasible. If the plan is too ambitious for the client's current abilities, then the therapist and the client work out a different plan.<ref name=\"Glasser 1972\"/>\n\n==Principles==\nThere are several basic principles of reality therapy that must be applied to make this technique most successful.<ref name=Wubbolding/>\n\n*Focus on the present and avoid discussing the past because all human problems are caused by unsatisfying present [[Interpersonal relationship|relationship]]s.\n*Avoid discussing [[symptoms]] and complaints as much as possible since these are often the ineffective ways that clients choose to deal with (and hold on to) unsatisfying relationships.\n*Understand the concept of total behavior, which means focus on what clients can do, directly act, and think.\n*Spend less time on what they cannot do directly such as changing their feelings and [[physiology]]. Feelings and physiology can be changed indirectly, but only if there is a change in the acting and thinking.\n*Avoid [[wikt:criticize|criticizing]], blaming and/or complaining and help clients do the same. By doing this, they learn to avoid these extremely harmful external control behaviors that destroy relationships.\n*Remain non-judgmental and non-coercive, but encourage people to judge all they are doing by the Choice Theory [[axiom]]: Is what I am doing getting me closer to the people I need? If the choice of behaviors is not getting people closer, then the therapist works to help the client find new behaviors that lead to a better connection.\n*Teach clients that legitimate or not, excuses stand directly in the way of their ability to make needed connections.\n*Focus on specifics.

Based on their experience, therapists may suggest plans, but should not give the message that there is only one plan. A plan is always open to revision or rejection by the client.\n*Be patient and supportive but keep focusing on the source of the problem: disconnectedness. Clients who have been disconnected for a long time will find it difficult to reconnect. They are often so involved in the harmful behavior that they have lost sight of the fact that they need to reconnect. Help them to understand Choice Theory and explain that whatever their complaint, reconnecting is the best possible solution to their problem.\n\n== Applications ==\n\nIn [[education]], reality therapy can be used as a basis for the school's classroom management plan.<ref name=Wubbolding/> Reality therapy has been shown to be effective in improving underachieving junior high school students' internal perception of control.<ref name=Wubbolding/> Their internal perception of control refers to their [[locus of control]] being internal or external.<ref name=Wubbolding/> Reality therapy can be used to help [[school psychologist]]s improve students with emotional and behavioral disturbances.<ref>Passaro, P.
