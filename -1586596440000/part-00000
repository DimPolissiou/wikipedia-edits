The town developed as a local administrative center and market town, noted for its [[lacquerware]] and brewing of ''[[sake]]''. After the [[Meiji Restoration]], it was organized as part of [[Yama District, Fukushima|Yama District]], Fukushima Prefecture. The town of Kitakami was created with the establishment of the modern municipalities system on April 1, 1889.\n\nIn 1882, more than 3,000 peasants gathered at the Danjo-ga-hara Field in [[Shiokawa, Fukushima|Shiokawa]] and then marched on the Kitakata Police Station to rebel against the oppression of the prefectural government. Known as the [[Kitakata Incident]] of 1882, it was the first public expression of the [[Freedom and People's Rights Movement]] in the Tohoku area.<ref name=\"Fukushima Today & Tomorrow, page 18\"/>\n\nKitakata Town was raised to city status on March 31, 1954. On January 4, 2006, the towns of [[Shiokawa, Fukushima|Shiokawa]] and [[Yamato, Fukushima|Yamato]], and the villages of [[Atsushiokan\u014d, Fukushima|Atsushiokan\u014d]] and [[Takasato, Fukushima|Takasato]] (all from [[Yama District, Fukushima|Yama District]]) were merged into Kitakata.\n\n==Government==\nKitakata has a [[mayor-council]] form of government with a directly elected mayor and a [[unicameral]] city legislature of 25 members. Kitakata, together with [[Yama District, Fukushima|Yama District]] contribute two members to the Fukushima Prefectural Assembly. In terms of national politics, the city is part of [[Fukushima 4th district]] of the [[House of Representatives of Japan|lower house]] of the [[Diet of Japan]].\n\n==Economy==\nKitakata is a local commercial center. Agricultural products include rice and hops. The area is traditionally noted for ''[[sake]]'' brewing and [[lacquerware]]. Modern industries include [[Aluminium smelting|aluminum smelting]].\n\n==Education==\nKitakata has 17 public elementary school and seven public junior high schools operated by the city government, and four public high schools operated by the Fukushima Prefectural Board of Education. The prefecture  also operates a vocational training school.\n\n==Transportation==\n===Railway===\n[[File:JR logo (east).svg|20px]] [[JR East]] \u2013 [[Ban'etsu West Line]]\n* {{STN|Shiokawa}} - {{STN|Ubad\u014d}} - {{STN|Aizu-Toyokawa}} - {{STN|Kitakata}} - {{STN|Yamato|Fukushima}} - {{STN|Ogino|Fukushima}}\n\n===Highway===\n* {{jct|country=JPN|Route|121}}\n* {{jct|country=JPN|Route|459}}\n\n==Sister city relations==\n*{{Flagicon|United States}} [[Wilsonville, Oregon]], United States\n\n==Local attractions==\n*Kitakata is well known for its distinctive [[Kitakata ramen|ramen]]''.'' The area within its former city boundaries has the highest per-capita number of ramen establishments in Japan. Ramen has such prominence in the region that locally, the word ''soba'' usually refers to ''ramen'', and not to actual ''[[soba]]'' which is referred to as ''nihon soba'' (\"Japanese soba\"). Kitakata's ''ramen'' consists of rather thick, flat, curly noodles served in a pork and ''[[niboshi]]'' broth.\n\n*The city has over 2,600 [[Kura (storehouse)|''kura'']] storehouses which are now typically used as ''[[sake]]'' breweries, living quarters and workshops.<ref>''Japan'', Lonely Planet (2007) p505.</ref>\n*[[Aizushing\u016b Castle ruins]], National Historic Site\n\n==Noted people from Kitakata==\n*[[Uryu Iwako]], social worker\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category-inline}}\n* [http://www.city.kitakata.fukushima.jp/ Official Website] {{in lang|ja}}\n* [http://www.kitakata-kanko.jp/ Kitakata Sightseeing Association] {{in lang|ja}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Fukushima}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Cities in Fukushima Prefecture]]\n[[Category:Kitakata, Fukushima]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox settlement\n<!-- See Template:Infobox settlement for additional fields and descriptions -->\n| name                    = {{raise|0.2em|Kitakata}}\n| native_name             = {{lower|0.1em|{{nobold|{{lang|ja|\u559c\u591a\u65b9\u5e02}}}}}}\n| official_name           = \n| native_name_lang        = ja\n| settlement_type         = [[Cities of Japan|City]]\n<!-- images, nickname, motto -->\n| image_skyline           =\u559c\u591a\u65b9\u5e02\u5f79\u6240.JPG \n| imagesize               = \n| image_alt               = \n| image_caption           = Kitakata City Hall\n| image_flag              = Flag of Kitakata Fukushima.JPG\n| flag_alt                = \n| image_seal              = Symbol of Kitakata Fukushima.svg\n| seal_alt                = \n| image_shield            = \n| shield_alt              = \n| image_blank_emblem      = \n| nickname                = \n| motto                   = \n<!-- maps and coordinates -->\n| image_map               = Kitakata in Fukushima Prefecture Ja.svg\n| map_alt                 = \n| map_caption             = Location of Kitakata in Fukushima Prefecture\n| pushpin_map             = Japan\n| pushpin_label_position  = <!-- position of the pushpin label: left, right, top, bottom, none -->\n| pushpin_map_alt         = \n| pushpin_map_caption     = &nbsp; \n| coordinates             = {{coord|37|39|4.1|N|139|52|29.1|E|region:JP|display=inline,title}}\n| coor_pinpoint           = <!-- to specify exact location of coordinates (was coor_type) -->\n| coordinates_footnotes   = <!-- for references: use <ref> tags -->\n<!-- location -->\n| subdivision_type        = [[List of sovereign states|Country]]\n| subdivision_name        = [[Japan]]\n| subdivision_type1       = [[List of regions of Japan|Region]]\n| subdivision_name1       = [[T\u014dhoku region|T\u014dhoku]]\n| subdivision_type2       = [[Prefectures of Japan|Prefecture]]\n| subdivision_name2       = [[Fukushima Prefecture|Fukushima]]\n| subdivision_type3       = \n| subdivision_name3       = \n<!-- established -->\n| established_title       = <!-- Settled -->\n| established_date        = \n| founder                 = \n| named_for               = \n<!-- seat, smaller parts -->\n| seat_type               = <!-- defaults to: Seat -->\n| seat                    = \n<!-- government type, leaders -->\n| government_footnotes    = <!-- for references: use <ref> tags -->\n| leader_party            = \n| leader_title            = Mayor\n| leader_name             = Chuichi Endo\n| leader_title1           = \n| leader_name1            = <!-- etc., up to leader_title4 / leader_name4 -->\n<!-- display settings  -->\n| total_type              = <!-- to set a non-standard label for total area and population rows -->\n| unit_pref               = <!-- enter: Imperial, to display imperial before metric -->\n<!-- area -->\n| area_magnitude          = <!-- use only to set a special wikilink -->\n| area_footnotes          = <!-- for references: use <ref> tags -->\n| area_total_km2          = 554.63\n| area_land_km2           = \n| area_water_km2          = \n| area_water_percent      = \n| area_note               = \n<!-- elevation -->\n| elevation_footnotes     = <!-- for references: use <ref> tags -->\n| elevation_m             = \n<!-- population -->\n| population_footnotes    = <!-- for references: use <ref> tags -->\n| population_total        = 47184\n| population_as_of        = November 1, 2017\n| population_density_km2  = auto\n| population_est          = \n| pop_est_as_of           = \n| population_demonym      = <!-- demonym, ie.

The town developed as a local administrative center and market town, noted for its [[lacquerware]] and brewing of ''[[sake]]''. After the [[Meiji Restoration]], it was organized as part of [[Yama District, Fukushima|Yama District]], Fukushima Prefecture. The town of Kitakami was created with the establishment of the modern municipalities system on April 1, 1889.\n\nIn 1882, more than 3,000 peasants gathered at the Danjo-ga-hara Field in [[Shiokawa, Fukushima|Shiokawa]] and then marched on the Kitakata Police Station to rebel against the oppression of the prefectural government. Known as the [[Kitakata Incident]] of 1882, it was the first public expression of the [[Freedom and People's Rights Movement]] in the Tohoku area.<ref name=\"Fukushima Today & Tomorrow, page 18\"/>\n\nKitakata Town was raised to city status on March 31, 1954. On January 4, 2006, the towns of [[Shiokawa, Fukushima|Shiokawa]] and [[Yamato, Fukushima|Yamato]], and the villages of [[Atsushiokan\u014d, Fukushima|Atsushiokan\u014d]] and [[Takasato, Fukushima|Takasato]] (all from [[Yama District, Fukushima|Yama District]]) were merged into Kitakata.\n\n==Government==\nKitakata has a [[mayor-council]] form of government with a directly elected mayor and a [[unicameral]] city legislature of 25 members.\n\n==Economy==\nKitakata is a local commercial center. Agricultural products include rice and hops. The area is traditionally noted for ''[[sake]]'' brewing and [[lacquerware]]. Modern industries include [[Aluminium smelting|aluminum smelting]].\n\n==Education==\nKitakata has 17 public elementary school and seven public junior high schools operated by the city government, and four public high schools operated by the Fukushima Prefectural Board of Education. The prefecture  also operates a vocational training school.\n\n==Transportation==\n===Railway===\n[[File:JR logo (east).svg|20px]] [[JR East]] \u2013 [[Ban'etsu West Line]]\n* {{STN|Shiokawa}} - {{STN|Ubad\u014d}} - {{STN|Aizu-Toyokawa}} - {{STN|Kitakata}} - {{STN|Yamato|Fukushima}} - {{STN|Ogino|Fukushima}}\n\n===Highway===\n* {{jct|country=JPN|Route|121}}\n* {{jct|country=JPN|Route|459}}\n\n==Sister city relations==\n*{{Flagicon|United States}} [[Wilsonville, Oregon]], United States\n\n==Local attractions==\nKitakata is well known for its distinctive [[Kitakata ramen|ramen]]''.'' The area within its former city boundaries has the highest per-capita number of ramen establishments in Japan. Ramen has such prominence in the region that locally, the word ''soba'' usually refers to ''ramen'', and not to actual ''[[soba]]'' which is referred to as ''nihon soba'' (\"Japanese soba\"). Kitakata's ''ramen'' consists of rather thick, flat, curly noodles served in a pork and ''[[niboshi]]'' broth.\n\nThe city has over 2,600 [[Kura (storehouse)|''kura'']] storehouses which are now typically used as ''[[sake]]'' breweries, living quarters and workshops.<ref>''Japan'', Lonely Planet (2007) p505.</ref>\n\n==Noted people from Kitakata==\n*[[Uryu Iwako]] \u2013 social worker\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category-inline}}\n* [http://www.city.kitakata.fukushima.jp/ Official Website] {{in lang|ja}}\n* [http://www.kitakata-kanko.jp/ Kitakata Sightseeing Association] {{in lang|ja}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Fukushima}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n[[Category:Cities in Fukushima Prefecture]]\n[[Category:Kitakata, Fukushima]]\n", "name_user": "MChew", "label": "safe", "comment": "update", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kitakata,_Fukushima"}

While on assignment for a story about a [[theatre workshop|workshop theatre]], he was cast as an actor. He stayed with the [[improvisation]]al company for two years (along with then-unknown [[Danny Glover]]).{{cn| date= February 2020}}\n\n==Career==\nHis first major role was Detective Marcus Petrie on the television series ''[[Cagney & Lacey]]'' (1982\u20131988). In 1985 he appeared as [[Theseus]] in ''The Gospel At Colonus'', an African-American musical iteration of the [[Oedipus]] legend, which starred [[Morgan Freeman]] and [[The Blind Boys Of Alabama]], on [[PBS]]' ''Great Performances'' series. \n\nIn 1987, he garnered positive reviews for his portrayal of [[Black Panther Party]] co-founder [[Bobby Seale]] in the [[HBO]] television movie ''Conspiracy: The Trial of the Chicago 8''. In 1989-90, he portrayed ongoing character Earl Williams (named for the prisoner in Ben Hecht and Charles MacArthur's story ''[[The Front Page]]''), a teacher falsely accused of the rape/murder of a female student, in the hit TV series ''[[L.A. Law]]''.\n\nFrom 1994\u20131995, Lumbly starred as the main character in the short-lived [[science fiction]] series ''[[M.A.N.T.I.S.]]'' Perhaps his most visible role was as [[Marcus Dixon (Alias)|Marcus Dixon]] in the American television series ''[[Alias (TV series)|Alias]]'' (2001\u20132006). \n\nOther prominent roles include providing the voice for the [[Martian Manhunter]] in ''[[Justice League (TV series)|Justice League]]'' and ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]'', which is why he was cast as the father of the same character in 2017 for the TV show ''[[Supergirl (TV series)|Supergirl]]''.

Lumbly appeared as [[List of minor characters in Battlestar Galactica (re-imagining)#Daniel 'Bulldog' Novacek|Lt.

He graduated from [[Minneapolis South High School|South High School]] there and [[Macalester College]] in nearby [[St. Paul, Minnesota|St. Paul]]. \n\nLumbly's first career was as a journalist in Minnesota. While on assignment for a story about a [[theatre workshop|workshop theatre]], he was cast as an actor. He stayed with the [[improvisation]]al company for two years (along with then-unknown [[Danny Glover]]).{{cn| date= February 2020}}\n\n==Career==\nHis first major role was Detective Marcus Petrie on the television series ''[[Cagney & Lacey]]'' (1982\u20131988). In 1985 he appeared as [[Theseus]] in ''The Gospel At Colonus'', an African-American musical iteration of the [[Oedipus]] legend, which starred [[Morgan Freeman]] and [[The Blind Boys Of Alabama]], on [[PBS]]' ''Great Performances'' series. \n\nIn 1987, he garnered positive reviews for his portrayal of [[Black Panther Party]] co-founder [[Bobby Seale]] in the [[HBO]] television movie ''Conspiracy: The Trial of the Chicago 8''. In 1989-90, he portrayed ongoing character Earl Williams (named for the prisoner in Ben Hecht and Charles MacArthur's story ''[[The Front Page]]''), a teacher falsely accused of the rape/murder of a female student, in the hit TV series ''[[L.A. Law]]''.\n\nFrom 1994\u20131995, Lumbly starred as the main character in the short-lived [[science fiction]] series ''[[M.A.N.T.I.S.]]'' Perhaps his most visible role was as [[Marcus Dixon (Alias)|Marcus Dixon]] in the American television series ''[[Alias (TV series)|Alias]]'' (2001\u20132006). \n\nOther prominent roles include providing the voice for the [[Martian Manhunter]] in ''[[Justice League (TV series)|Justice League]]'' and ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]'', which is why he was cast as the father of the same character in 2017 for the TV show ''[[Supergirl (TV series)|Supergirl]]''.

Although the movie was focused on Dellums' daughter's friendship with a white [[South Africa]]n girl, the film also discussed Dellums' role in ending [[apartheid]] in South Africa.\n\nAlso in 2000, Lumbly guest starred in the season one ''[[The West Wing]]'' episode \"[[Six Meetings Before Lunch]]\" as Jeff Breckenridge, a nominee for U.S. Assistant Attorney General who supports [[reparations for slavery]]. Lumbly appeared as [[List of minor characters in Battlestar Galactica (re-imagining)#Daniel 'Bulldog' Novacek|Lt.

Their sound has been described as having a unique feel and Aboriginal (Indigenous Australian) qualities. The band performs using guitar, bass, drums, and Aboriginal instruments \u2013 didjeridu, bundawuthada (gong stone) and clap sticks \u2013 to play traditional music such as the haunting \"Mouydjengara\", a whale-dreaming song of the [[Mirning people]].\n\n==Background and members==\n[[File:Bunna Lawrie.jpg|thumb|Bunna Lawrie (Feb 2012)]] \nThe original Coloured Stone band members were three brothers, [[Bunna Lawrie]] (drums & lead vocals), and Neil Coaby (rhythm guitar & backing vocals) and Mackie Coaby (bass & backing vocals), and their nephew, Bruce (aka Bunny) Mundy (lead guitar & backing vocals). All are from the community of Koonibba, South Australia. [[Bunna Lawrie]] is the leader and singer of the band and he was also their original drummer.\n\n[[Bunna Lawrie]] is also a member and respected elder of the Mirning Aboriginal tribe from the Coastal Nullabor, South Australia. He is a Mirning whaledreamer and songman, medicine man and story teller of his tribe. He is Coloured Stone's founding member and chief songwriter.\n\nThe band's single, \"Black Boy\" was a success when first released in 1984 -it became the number one song in Fiji and it sold 120,000 copies. It was followed by \"When You Gonna Learn\" and \"Dancin' in the Moonlight\".  The lyrics of \"Black Boy\" included the line \"Black boy, black boy, the colour of your skin is your pride and joy,\" which was a somewhat revolutionary sentiment for Aboriginals of Australia in the 1980s. It moved black audiences to increase their dancing each time it was played at an early gig in Alice Springs.\n\n[[Bunna Lawrie]]'s son, Jason Scott played guitar, bass, drums and didgeridoo for Coloured Stone from the age of 13 years. His first major gig was \"Rock Against Racism\" in Adelaide. Jason has also performed at the Sydney Opera House and he toured the US in 1994 with the Wirrangu Band as part of a cultural exchange program. With his band 'Desert Sea', Jason released an album in 2002 titled 'From the Desert to the Sea'.\n\nThe current members of Coloured Stone are: [[Bunna Lawrie]] (vocals, rhythm guitar, didgeridoo, gong stone), Selwyn Burns (lead guitar, vocals), Peter Hood (drums), Cee Cee Honeybee (backing vocals) and guest musicians (bass guitarist, didgeridoo player, keyboard player.\n\n==Support for Aboriginal causes==\n\nPeter Dawson reported on Coloured Stone's April 1998 outdoor gig; the first day Wild Water opened for Coloured Stone and Regurgitator at Brown's Mart Community Arts Centre, to an enthusiastic audience, both black and white, which danced til three in the morning. On the third day the band went to Jabiru, Northern Territory, to play at the Sports and Social Club. At dawn on day four, Coloured Stone travelled to Jabiluka to play on a makeshift stage in support of the [[Mirrar]] people's protest blockade of the road to a uranium mine on Mirrar land.\n\nFrom March to August 2001, [[Bunna Lawrie]] and fellow Aboriginal musician Barry Cedric took part in a songwriting workshop for Aboriginal youth at Yarrabah. The young people learned to play musical instruments, compose a song and set it to music. At the end, six youths went to Cairns to record their song, \"One Fire\", in a recording studio.\n\n==Awards==\n\n[[Bunna Lawrie]] and his band Coloured Stone have won the following prestigious awards for their contribution to Australian Aboriginal music and Australian non-indigenous music:\n\n*2012: National NAIDOC Lifetime Achievement Award (Australia) to Bunna Lawrie\n*2011: National Indigenous Music Awards Hall of Fame for Special Recognition (Australia) to Bunna Lawrie & Coloured Stone\n*2000: Don Banks Music Award for Composers (Australia) to Bunna Lawrie\n*1999: Deadly Vibe Awards for Outstanding Achievement of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders (Australia) \u2013 National Outstanding Contribution to Aboriginal music Award to Bunna Lawrie Coloured Stone \n*1995: Brian Syron Scholarship Award (Australia) \u2013 Contribution to Aboriginal music\n*1993: [[ARIA Music Awards of 1993|ARIA Award for Best Indigenous Record]] (nomination) for ''Inma Juju''\n*1990: [[ARIA Music Awards of 1990|ARIA Award for Best Indigenous Record]] (nomination) for ''Crazy Mind''\n*1989: [[ARIA Music Awards of 1989|ARIA Award for Best Cover Art]] (nomination) for ''Wild Desert Rose''\n*1987: [[ARIA Music Awards of 1987|ARIA Award for Best Indigenous Album]] for ''Human Love''\n*1978: Perth\u2019s 3rd National Aboriginal Country Music Festival Talent (West Australia) \u2013 First Prize for Best Band\n*1978: Perth\u2019s 3rd National Aboriginal Country Music Festival Talent (West Australia) \u2013 Best Original Song for \u201cDancing in the Moonlight\u201d\n\n==Discography==\n\n===Albums===\n\n*''Dance to the Sun'' (2013)\n*Bunna Lawrie's \u2018\u2019Beautiful World\u2019\u2019 - solo album (2010)\n*''Bunna Lawrie's Best of Coloured Stone II'' (2008)\n*''Rhythm of Nature'' (1998)\n*''Bunna Lawrie's Best Of Coloured Stone'' (1997)\n*''Songs from the Nullarbor'' (1995)\n*''Barefeet Dancing'' (1995)\n*''Inma Juju'' (1991)\n*''Crazy Mind'' (1989)\n*''Wild Desert Rose'' (1988)\n*''Human Love'' (1986)\n*''Black Rock from the Red Centre'' (1986)\n*''Koonibba Rock'' (1985)\n\n===Singles===\n\n*\"Australia\" (2000)\n*\"Love is the Medicine\" (1992)\n*\"Wild Desert Rose\" (1988)\n*\"Stay Young\" (1988)\n*\"Dancing in the Moonlight\" (1986)\n*\"Island Of Greed\" (1985) \n*\"Black Boy\" (1984)\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{refbegin}}\n*{{cite web|last=Ryan|first=P|title=Mujik \u2013 Coloured Stone in 1985 \u2013 Cultural Pages|url=http://www.mujik.com/kultcha/pages/kulncsin.html|publisher=RAM Magazine|accessdate=30 December 2013|date=10 June 2006}}\n*{{cite web|last=Dawson|first=Peter|title=Mujik \u2013 Musicians on a Mission \u2013 Cultural Pages|url=http://www.mujik.com/kultcha/pages/kulnmoam.html|accessdate=30 December 2013|date=10 June 2006}}\n*{{cite web|title=Celebrity Vibe: Jason Scott|url=http://www.vibe.com.au/vibe/corporate/celebrity_vibe/showceleb.asp?id=18|publisher=Vibe Australia|accessdate=30 December 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060104154813/http://www.vibe.com.au/vibe/corporate/celebrity_vibe/showceleb.asp?id=18|archivedate=4 January 2006|date=1 January 2001}}\n*{{cite web|last=Daniels|first=Carmen|title=\"ONE FIRE\": Yarrabah Youth Write and Record a Song with Indigenous Recording Artists!|url=http://www.ayn.ca/index.html?id=140|publisher=Aboriginal Youth Network|accessdate=30 December 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071011072106/http://www.ayn.ca/ViewNews.aspx?id=140|archivedate=11 October 2007|date=1 September 2011}}\n*{{cite book |last=Hayward |first=Philip |authorlink= |title=Sound Alliances: Indigenous Peoples, Cultural Politics, and Popular Music in the Pacific |year=1998 |publisher=Continuum International Publishing Group |isbn=978-0-304-70050-9}}\n*{{cite book |last=Dunbar-Hall |first=Peter |authorlink= |author2=Chris Gibson |title=Deadly Sounds, Deadly Places.

With his band 'Desert Sea', Jason released an album in 2002 titled 'From the Desert to the Sea'.\n\nThe current members of Coloured Stone are: [[Bunna Lawrie]] (vocals, rhythm guitar, didgeridoo, gong stone), Selwyn Burns (lead guitar, vocals), Peter Hood (drums), Cee Cee Honeybee (backing vocals) and guest musicians (bass guitarist, didgeridoo player, keyboard player.\n\n==Support for Aboriginal causes==\n\nPeter Dawson reported on Coloured Stone's April 1998 outdoor gig; the first day Wild Water opened for Coloured Stone and Regurgitator at Brown's Mart Community Arts Centre, to an enthusiastic audience, both black and white, which danced til three in the morning. On the third day the band went to Jabiru, Northern Territory, to play at the Sports and Social Club. At dawn on day four, Coloured Stone travelled to Jabiluka to play on a makeshift stage in support of the Mirrar tribe's protest blockade of the road to a uranium mine on Mirrar land.\n\nFrom March to August 2001, [[Bunna Lawrie]] and fellow Aboriginal musician Barry Cedric took part in a songwriting workshop for Aboriginal youth at Yarrabah. The young people learned to play musical instruments, compose a song and set it to music. At the end, six youths went to Cairns to record their song, \"One Fire\", in a recording studio.\n\n==Awards==\n\n[[Bunna Lawrie]] and his band Coloured Stone have won the following prestigious awards for their contribution to Australian Aboriginal music and Australian non-indigenous music:\n\n*2012: National NAIDOC Lifetime Achievement Award (Australia) to Bunna Lawrie\n*2011: National Indigenous Music Awards Hall of Fame for Special Recognition (Australia) to Bunna Lawrie & Coloured Stone\n*2000: Don Banks Music Award for Composers (Australia) to Bunna Lawrie\n*1999: Deadly Vibe Awards for Outstanding Achievement of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders (Australia) \u2013 National Outstanding Contribution to Aboriginal music Award to Bunna Lawrie Coloured Stone \n*1995: Brian Syron Scholarship Award (Australia) \u2013 Contribution to Aboriginal music\n*1993: [[ARIA Music Awards of 1993|ARIA Award for Best Indigenous Record]] (nomination) for ''Inma Juju''\n*1990: [[ARIA Music Awards of 1990|ARIA Award for Best Indigenous Record]] (nomination) for ''Crazy Mind''\n*1989: [[ARIA Music Awards of 1989|ARIA Award for Best Cover Art]] (nomination) for ''Wild Desert Rose''\n*1987: [[ARIA Music Awards of 1987|ARIA Award for Best Indigenous Album]] for ''Human Love''\n*1978: Perth\u2019s 3rd National Aboriginal Country Music Festival Talent (West Australia) \u2013 First Prize for Best Band\n*1978: Perth\u2019s 3rd National Aboriginal Country Music Festival Talent (West Australia) \u2013 Best Original Song for \u201cDancing in the Moonlight\u201d\n\n==Discography==\n\n===Albums===\n\n*''Dance to the Sun'' (2013)\n*Bunna Lawrie's \u2018\u2019Beautiful World\u2019\u2019 - solo album (2010)\n*''Bunna Lawrie's Best of Coloured Stone II'' (2008)\n*''Rhythm of Nature'' (1998)\n*''Bunna Lawrie's Best Of Coloured Stone'' (1997)\n*''Songs from the Nullarbor'' (1995)\n*''Barefeet Dancing'' (1995)\n*''Inma Juju'' (1991)\n*''Crazy Mind'' (1989)\n*''Wild Desert Rose'' (1988)\n*''Human Love'' (1986)\n*''Black Rock from the Red Centre'' (1986)\n*''Koonibba Rock'' (1985)\n\n===Singles===\n\n*\"Australia\" (2000)\n*\"Love is the Medicine\" (1992)\n*\"Wild Desert Rose\" (1988)\n*\"Stay Young\" (1988)\n*\"Dancing in the Moonlight\" (1986)\n*\"Island Of Greed\" (1985) \n*\"Black Boy\" (1984)\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{refbegin}}\n*{{cite web|last=Ryan|first=P|title=Mujik \u2013 Coloured Stone in 1985 \u2013 Cultural Pages|url=http://www.mujik.com/kultcha/pages/kulncsin.html|publisher=RAM Magazine|accessdate=30 December 2013|date=10 June 2006}}\n*{{cite web|last=Dawson|first=Peter|title=Mujik \u2013 Musicians on a Mission \u2013 Cultural Pages|url=http://www.mujik.com/kultcha/pages/kulnmoam.html|accessdate=30 December 2013|date=10 June 2006}}\n*{{cite web|title=Celebrity Vibe: Jason Scott|url=http://www.vibe.com.au/vibe/corporate/celebrity_vibe/showceleb.asp?id=18|publisher=Vibe Australia|accessdate=30 December 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060104154813/http://www.vibe.com.au/vibe/corporate/celebrity_vibe/showceleb.asp?id=18|archivedate=4 January 2006|date=1 January 2001}}\n*{{cite web|last=Daniels|first=Carmen|title=\"ONE FIRE\": Yarrabah Youth Write and Record a Song with Indigenous Recording Artists!|url=http://www.ayn.ca/index.html?id=140|publisher=Aboriginal Youth Network|accessdate=30 December 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071011072106/http://www.ayn.ca/ViewNews.aspx?id=140|archivedate=11 October 2007|date=1 September 2011}}\n*{{cite book |last=Hayward |first=Philip |authorlink= |title=Sound Alliances: Indigenous Peoples, Cultural Politics, and Popular Music in the Pacific |year=1998 |publisher=Continuum International Publishing Group |isbn=978-0-304-70050-9}}\n*{{cite book |last=Dunbar-Hall |first=Peter |authorlink= |author2=Chris Gibson |title=Deadly Sounds, Deadly Places.

As of 2016, the Tejas Mark 1 was in production for the Indian Air Force (IAF) and the naval version was undergoing flight tests for Indian Navy (IN).

Aside from academics, she featured in politics as shabester constituency representative in the Islamic consultative assembly. This position took effect during the June 2016 [[parliament]]ary elections where she was elected as a member of the tenth Islamic parliament under the [[auspices]] of reformist universal alliance party. The post was halted after she was declared ineligible to participate in the 2020 parliamentary elections for religious reasons. She was also a member of [[Iranian parliament]]'s economy commission.\n\nThese political positions availed her of the opportunity to be one of the attendees of the 15th parliamentary union of the [[Organization of Islamic Cooperation]] (OIC) member states (PUIC) held in Burkina Faso on 28 January 2020, where sharing experiences in law formulation with other Muslim lawmakers was the subject of discussion.\n\nAs a member of the tenth Islamic parliament, she advocated for [[privatization]] of the automobile industry, to ensure industry protection, enhancement and promotion.
