[[Gregory the Great]] (590\u2013604) entrusted to Bishop [[Gaudiosus of Gubbio]] the spiritual care of [[Tadinum]], about a mile from the modern [[Gualdo Tadino|Gualdo]], which had been long without a bishop of its own.\n\nIn the eighth century [[Gubbio]] became part of the [[Patrimony of St. Peter]], together with the [[duchy of Spoleto]]. [[Arsenius of Gubbio]] (855) together with [[Nicholas of Anagni]], opposed the election of [[Pope Benedict III]]. It was often at war with [[Perugia]], and its victory in 1151 over Perugia and ten other towns is famous. [[Ubald|St. Ubald]], bishop of the city, directed the campaign. Gubbio favoured the [[Ghibelline]] party; however, in 1260 the [[Guelphs]] surprised the town, and drove out the Ghibellines; who returned again in 1300 under the leadership of [[Uguccione della Faggiola]], and [[Federico I da Montefeltro]], whereupon [[Pope Boniface VIII]] sent his nephew [[Napoleone Orsini]] who drove them out once more.\n\nGiovanni Gabrielli, lord of Gubbio, was expelled by [[Cardinal Albornoz]] (1354) and the town handed over to a pontifical vicar.<ref>McCracken, pp. 69-70.</ref> In 1381, however, the bishop, Gabriele Gabrielli, succeeded in being appointed pontifical vicar and again, lord of Gubbio.\n\nOther bishops of Gubbio were\n\n*Rudolph [[Gabrielli]] (1061), honoured for his sanctity by [[Peter Damian]];{{contradict-inline|date=October 2016}} \n*[[Alessandro Sperelli]] (1644), author of many learned works, who restored the cathedral.\n\n===Schism of 1159\u20131179===\nThe bishopric of Theobaldus Balbi, O.S.B. (1160\u20131179) was unfortunately a time of great upheaval in the Church. The papal conclave of September 1159 had produced two popes, and a schism. The majority of cardinals elected Cardinal Rolando Bandinelli, who called himself [[Pope Alexander III]]; a minority stood by Cardinal Octavianus de' Monticelli, who called himself [[Antipope Victor IV (1159\u20131164)|Pope Victor IV]]. Victor was a friend and adherent of the Emperor [[Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick Barbarossa]].<ref>M.

Donnato, Abbot Bonactus (Bonnato). The schism thus enveloped the diocese of Gubbio.<ref>Cappelletti, p. 394.</ref>\n\nA grant to the Church of Gubbio by the Emperor Frederick, dated 8 November 1163, indicates that the Ghibellines were in full control of the city and that Bonactus was bishop-elect. Bishop Theobaldus had retreated to the monastery of Fonte Avellina, where he had been Prior before his election as bishop; there he remained until the death of the intruder Bonactus, in 1164 or 1165.<ref>Cappelletti, pp. 394-396.</ref> The schismatic Pope Victor IV died on 20 April 1164, and his schismatic successor Guido Cremensis ([[Antipope Paschal III]]) died on 20 September 1168.<ref>Gregorovus, p. 594. {{cite book|author=Karl Joseph von Hefele|title=Histoire des Conciles|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8nYUAAAAYAAJ&pg=PP7|volume=Tome septieme|year=1872|publisher=Le Clere et Cie|location=Paris|language=French|pages=430\u2013434}}</ref> Their successor, Joannes de Struma ([[Antipope Callixtus III|Calixtus III]]), surrendered to the real Pope, Alexander III, on 29 August 1178. The remnants of the schism were liquidated at the [[Third Council of the Lateran]] in March 1179, by which time Bishop Theobaldus had died.<ref>Hefele, VII, pp. 499-500, 513.</ref>\n\n===Suffragan===\nFrom time immemorial, the bishops of Gubbio had been directly subordinate (suffragans) of the Holy See (Papacy), with no supervisory archbishop intervening, and were therefore required to attend Roman synods. But in 1563 the situation was altered. In his bull ''Super universas'' of 4 June 1563, Pope Pius IV reorganized the administration of the territories of the March of Ancona by creating a new archbishopric by elevating the bishop and [[Archdiocese of Urbino]]. He created the new ecclesiastical province of Urbino, which was to include the dioceses of Cagli, Pesaro, Fossombrone, Montefeltro, Senigallia. and Gubbio.<ref>Cappelletti, Vol. III, pp. 206-208, quotes the full bull. The bishops of those dioceses (except the Bishop of Gubbio, who objected) took their oaths to their new Metropolitan, the Archbishop of Urbino, on 4 July and 12 July: Cappelletti, Vol. III, pp. 208-209.</ref> But, as a result of the resistance begun by Bishop [[Mariano Savelli]], it was not until the eighteenth century that Urbino could exercise effective metropolitan jurisdiction.\n\nIn the 15th century, the dukedoms of Montefeltro and Urbino fell into the hands of the della Rovere family. But the family did not prosper, in terms of male heirs. In 1623, the aged duke, [[Francesco Maria II della Rovere, Duke of Urbino|Francesco Maria II]] lost his only son to an epileptic fit. Without suitable collateral relatives, he determined to leave his dukedoms to the Papacy, and, on 30 April 1624, the appropriate documents were registered in Rome. Taddeo Barberini, the nephew of [[Pope Urban VIII]], took formal possession and appointed a governor, though Duke Francesco Maria continued to rule during his lifetime. When he died on 23 April 1631, Urbino, and Gubbio along with it, was incorporated into the Papal States.<ref>McCracken, pp. 107-111.</ref>\n\nIn accordance with the decree ''Christus Dominus'', chapter 40, of the [[Second Vatican Council]], on 15 August 1972 [[Pope Paul VI]] issued the decree ''Animorum utilitate'', in which he changed the status of the diocese of Perugia, from being directly dependent upon the Holy See to being a Metropolitan archdiocese. The ecclesiastical province of Perugia was to contain as [[suffragan]]s the dioceses of Assisi, Citta di Castello, Citta della Pieve, Foligno, Nocera and Tadinum, and Gubbio. The diocese of Gubbio ceased to be dependent upon the archdiocese of Urbino.<ref>[https://www.vatican.va/archive/aas/documents/AAS-64-1972-ocr.pdf ''Acta Apostolicae Sedis'' 64] (Citta del Vaticano: Typis Polyglottis Vaticanis 1972), pp. 667-668.</ref>\n\n===Synods===\nA diocesan synod was an irregularly held, but important, meeting of the bishop of a diocese and his clergy. Its purpose was (1) to proclaim generally the various decrees already issued by the bishop; (2) to discuss and ratify measures on which the bishop chose to consult with his clergy; (3) to publish statutes and decrees of the diocesan synod, of the provincial synod, and of the Holy See.<ref name=\"XIV1842\">{{cite book|author=Benedictus XIV|title=Benedicti XIV ...

Retrieved February 29, 2016</ref>\n\n==History==\n{{Refimprove section|date=March 2019}}\n\nThe earliest known Bishop of Gubbio is Decentius, though a letter of [[Pope Innocent I]] notes that he had predecessors.   [[Gregory the Great]] (590\u2013604) entrusted to Bishop [[Gaudiosus of Gubbio]] the spiritual care of [[Tadinum]], about a mile from the modern [[Gualdo Tadino|Gualdo]], which had been long without a bishop of its own.\n\nIn the eighth century [[Gubbio]] became part of the [[Patrimony of St. Peter]], together with the [[duchy of Spoleto]]. [[Arsenius of Gubbio]] (855) together with [[Nicholas of Anagni]], opposed the election of [[Pope Benedict III]]. It was often at war with [[Perugia]], and its victory in 1151 over Perugia and ten other towns is famous. [[Ubald|St. Ubald]], bishop of the city, directed the campaign. Gubbio favoured the [[Ghibelline]] party; however, in 1260 the [[Guelphs]] surprised the town, and drove out the Ghibellines; who returned again in 1300 under the leadership of [[Uguccione della Faggiola]], and [[Federico I da Montefeltro]], whereupon [[Pope Boniface VIII]] sent his nephew [[Napoleone Orsini]] who drove them out once more.\n\nGiovanni Gabrielli, lord of Gubbio, was expelled by [[Cardinal Albornoz]] (1354) and the town handed over to a pontifical vicar.<ref>McCracken, pp. 69-70.</ref> In 1381, however, the bishop, Gabriele Gabrielli, succeeded in being appointed pontifical vicar and again, lord of Gubbio.\n\nOther bishops of Gubbio were\n\n*Rudolph [[Gabrielli]] (1061), honoured for his sanctity by [[Peter Damian]];{{contradict-inline|date=October 2016}} \n*[[Alessandro Sperelli]] (1644), author of many learned works, who restored the cathedral. \n\n===Schism of 1159\u20131179===\nThe bishopric of Theobaldus Balbi, O.S.B. (1160\u20131179) was unfortunately a time of great upheaval in the Church. The papal conclave of September 1159 had produced two popes, and a schism. The majority of cardinals elected Cardinal Rolando Bandinelli, who called himself [[Pope Alexander III]]; a minority stood by Cardinal Octavianus de' Monticelli, who called himself [[Antipope Victor IV (1159\u20131164)|Pope Victor IV]]. Victor was a friend and adherent of the Emperor [[Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick Barbarossa]].<ref>M.

Donnato, Abbot Bonactus (Bonnato). The schism thus enveloped the diocese of Gubbio.<ref>Cappelletti, p. 394.</ref>\n\nA grant to the Church of Gubbio by the Emperor Frederick, dated 8 November 1163, indicates that the Ghibellines were in full control of the city and that Bonactus was bishop-elect. Bishop Theobaldus had retreated to the monastery of Fonte Avellina, where he had been Prior before his election as bishop; there he remained until the death of the intruder Bonactus, in 1164 or 1165.<ref>Cappelletti, pp. 394-396.</ref> The schismatic Pope Victor IV died on 20 April 1164, and his schismatic successor Guido Cremensis ([[Antipope Paschal III]]) died on 20 September 1168.<ref>Gregorovus, p. 594. {{cite book|author=Karl Joseph von Hefele|title=Histoire des Conciles|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8nYUAAAAYAAJ&pg=PP7|volume=Tome septieme|year=1872|publisher=Le Clere et Cie|location=Paris|language=French|pages=430-434}}</ref> Their successor, Joannes de Struma ([[Antipope Callixtus III|Calixtus III]]), surrendered to the real Pope, Alexander III, on 29 August 1178. The remnants of the schism were liquidated at the [[Third Council of the Lateran]] in March 1179, by which time Bishop Theobaldus had died.<ref>Hefele, VII, pp. 499-500, 513.</ref>\n\n===Suffragan===\nFrom time immemorial, the bishops of Gubbio had been directly subordinate (suffragans) of the Holy See (Papacy), with no supervisory archbishop intervening, and were therefore required to attend Roman synods. But in 1563 the situation was altered. In his bull ''Super universas'' of 4 June 1563, Pope Pius IV reorganized the administration of the territories of the March of Ancona by creating a new archbishopric by elevating the bishop and [[Archdiocese of Urbino]]. He created the new ecclesiastical province of Urbino, which was to include the dioceses of Cagli, Pesaro, Fossombrone, Montefeltro, Senigallia. and Gubbio.<ref>Cappelletti, Vol. III, pp. 206-208, quotes the full bull. The bishops of those dioceses (except the Bishop of Gubbio, who objected) took their oaths to their new Metropolitan, the Archbishop of Urbino, on 4 July and 12 July: Cappelletti, Vol. III, pp. 208-209.</ref> But, as a result of the resistance begun by Bishop [[Mariano Savelli]], it was not until the eighteenth century that Urbino could exercise effective metropolitan jurisdiction.\n\nIn the 15th century, the dukedoms of Montefeltro and Urbino fell into the hands of the della Rovere family. But the family did not prosper, in terms of male heirs. In 1623, the aged duke, [[Francesco Maria II della Rovere, Duke of Urbino|Francesco Maria II]] lost his only son to an epileptic fit. Without suitable collateral relatives, he determined to leave his dukedoms to the Papacy, and, on 30 April 1624, the appropriate documents were registered in Rome. Taddeo Barberini, the nephew of [[Pope Urban VIII]], took formal possession and appointed a governor, though Duke Francesco Maria continued to rule during his lifetime. When he died on 23 April 1631, Urbino, and Gubbio along with it, was incorporated into the Papal States.<ref>McCracken, pp. 107-111.</ref>\n\nIn accordance with the decree ''Christus Dominus'', chapter 40, of the [[Second Vatican Council]], on 15 August 1972 [[Pope Paul VI]] issued the decree ''Animorum utilitate'', in which he changed the status of the diocese of Perugia, from being directly dependent upon the Holy See to being a Metropolitan archdiocese. The ecclesiastical province of Perugia was to contain as [[suffragan]]s the dioceses of Assisi, Citta di Castello, Citta della Pieve, Foligno, Nocera and Tadinum, and Gubbio. The diocese of Gubbio ceased to be dependent upon the archdiocese of Urbino.<ref>[https://www.vatican.va/archive/aas/documents/AAS-64-1972-ocr.pdf ''Acta Apostolicae Sedis'' 64] (Citta del Vaticano: Typis Polyglottis Vaticanis 1972), pp. 667-668.</ref> \n\n===Synods===\nA diocesan synod was an irregularly held, but important, meeting of the bishop of a diocese and his clergy. Its purpose was (1) to proclaim generally the various decrees already issued by the bishop; (2) to discuss and ratify measures on which the bishop chose to consult with his clergy; (3) to publish statutes and decrees of the diocesan synod, of the provincial synod, and of the Holy See.<ref name=\"XIV1842\">{{cite book|author=Benedictus XIV|title=Benedicti XIV ...

{"title_page": "Laurence Bruce", "text_new": "'''Laurence Bruce of Cultmalindie''' (20 January 1547 \u2013 August 1617) was the son of John Bruce of Cultmalindie and [[Eupheme Elphinstone]].<ref>William Fraser, [https://archive.org/details/elphinstonefamil01fras/page/50/mode/2up ''Elphinstone Family Book'', vol. 1 (Edinburgh, 1897), pp. 50, 83.]</ref> Easter Cultmalindie is a small hamlet or \"[[fermtoun]]\" in [[Tibbermore]] parish, [[Perthshire]], [[Scotland]].\n\nThe Bruces of Cultmalindie were a minor branch of the Bruce family in Scotland, and were descendants of [[Robert the Bruce]], King of Scotland (1306-1329). Laurence Bruce was the half brother of [[Robert Stewart, 1st Earl of Orkney]]. Earl Robert was the recognized [[illegitimate]] son of [[James V]], King of Scotland, and Eupheme Elphinstone.\n\nAbout 1571 Laurence Bruce was appointed [[sheriff]] (the anglicised equivalent to the actual Norn-Scottish title of Foud or \"faud\", coming from the Norse term 'fogde', meaning approximately bailiff) of the [[Shetland Islands]] by Earl Robert. Accompanied by his nephew William Bruce of [[Crail]] (son of his full-brother Robert Bruce: although he may have been a son of Laurence) and other officials and armed men, Laurence Bruce moved to his new domain and set up his seat on the island of [[Unst]]. Once there he rapidly became unpopular due to his oppressive and corrupt rule. For example, it was alleged that he took bribes and that he had altered the official weights and measures to enhance the revenues of Earl Robert. His armed men felt free to seize control of ships and to billet themselves in the homes of the local people. Evidently Laurence Bruce helped himself to the local women, and is believed to have fathered approximately twenty-four illegitimate children beyond his ten legitimate children by his wives Helen Kennedy and Elizabeth Gray. Escalating conflict with the local Shetland Islanders resulted in a petition being sent to the royal court in [[Edinburgh]]. In response, a royal commission, the 'Mudy commission', travelled to Shetland and in February 1577 took evidence from 700 male Shetlanders. As a result, Laurence Bruce was removed from office. But by June of the following year, he had returned to the islands as \"sheriff-depute\".\n\nLaurence Bruce is best known as the builder of [[Muness Castle]], which was completed around 1598. Muness Castle, now a ruin, is the most northerly castle in [[Great Britain]]. It was built at the southeast end of [[Unst]], just east of the town of [[Uyeasound]], after Earl Robert was succeeded by his son [[Patrick Stewart, 2nd Earl of Orkney]] in 1593. Later events proved that Laurence Bruce had good reason to fear the aggression of Earl Patrick. In 1608 Earl Patrick sent a force to besiege the castle, but the attackers abandoned their assault. In 1610 Laurence Bruce testified against Earl Patrick before the [[Privy Council]] in Edinburgh. Following a rebellion in Orkney, in August 1614 the Privy Council appointed Laurence Bruce a Commissioner and charged him with apprehending any rebels who might seek shelter in Shetland.\n\nLaurence Bruce died at Muness castle in August 1617 and was buried inside the old church at nearby [[Sandwick, Shetland|Sandwick]]. Ownership of the castle passed to his second eldest son Andrew Bruce of Muness, a quieter and more popular man than his father. Laurence Bruce's eldest son, Alexander Bruce of Cultmalindie, returned to the mainland of Scotland to run the family's property in Perthshire.\n\nIllegitimate sons include Scipio Bruce of Meikleure. William Bruce of Symbister, his nephew (possible son) married Marjorie Stewart, a daughter of John Stewart (an illegitimate son of James V) and [[Jean Hepburn]].\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n*Clark, John, ''Genealogy, Records and Intermarriages of the Fordyce, Bruce & Clark Families at Uyeasound, Unst, Shetland, 2nd ed.''
