The document further reveals that \"Ethiopia is one of the most malaria-prone countries in Africa, with rates of morbidity and mortality increasing dramatically (i.e. 3.5-fold) during epidemics\". The same document alleges serious policy failures of the Government of Tedros who was the Minister of Health until 2013.

The document further reveals that \"Ethiopia is one of the most malaria-prone countries in Africa, with rates of morbidity and mortality increasing dramatically (i.e. 3.5-fold) during epidemics\". The same document alleges serious policy failures of the Government of Tedros who was the Minister of Health until 2013.

In addition to these challenges, the National Malaria Guideline stresses once again, \"serious problems in coordinating health interventions and implementing partners\".\n\n==== AIDS ====\nUnder Tedros, the Ministry of Health was able to turn around Ethiopia's record of the highest number of new HIV infections in Africa, bringing the number down dramatically.<ref name=\"AIGA\" /> The prevalence was reduced from its double digit record to 4.2 in cities and 0.6 in rural areas.<ref name=\"AIGA\" /> According to the HIV/AIDS Prevention and Control Office (HAPCO) said the rate of HIV infection in Ethiopia has declined by 90% between 2002 and 2012, while the rate AIDS-related death has dropped by 53%.<ref name=\"AIGA\" /> The number of people starting HIV treatment increased more than 150-fold during 2005\u20132008.<ref name=\"Yale\" />\n\nThe decline in the infection rate has been attributed to the concerted effort of the Ministry of Health in providing medicines and organizing various awareness-raising programs.<ref name=\"AIGA\" /> The office has managed to integrate the people in HIV prevention and control activities.

Prevention measures like the use of condoms have shot up starkly with increased awareness on the disease and advertising urging [[safe sex]] practices and condom use.<ref name=\"AIGA\" /> The government's collaboration with local and international governmental and nongovernmental organizations has also positively influenced access to HIV/AIDS related service centers.<ref name=\"AIGA\" />\n\n=== Family planning ===\nUnder Tedros' tenure, the unmet need for family planning in Ethiopia has declined, and the contraceptive prevalence rate has doubled in 5 years.

He emphasized the need for Africa to focus on issues of economic emancipation, peace and stability, the acceleration of rapid economic growth, governance and democratization.

The dam was expected to have a reservoir of around 70&nbsp;billion cubic meters, which was scheduled to start filling in 2014.  Egypt, Ethiopia and Sudan established an International Panel of Experts to review and assess the study reports on the dam. The panel consisted of 10 members; 6 from the three countries and 4 international in the fields of water resources and hydrologic modelling, dam engineering, socioeconomic, and environmental.<ref name=\"panel\" /> The panel held its fourth meeting in Addis Ababa in November 2012.

In many species, there are two major subsystems of the immune system: the [[innate immune system]] and the [[adaptive immune system]].  Both subsystems use [[humoral immunity]] and [[cell-mediated immunity]] to perform their functions.  In humans, the [[blood\u2013brain barrier]], [[blood\u2013cerebrospinal fluid barrier]], and similar fluid\u2013brain barriers separate the peripheral immune system from the [[neuroimmune system]], which protects the [[human brain|brain]].\n\nPathogens can rapidly [[evolution|evolve]] and adapt, and thereby avoid detection and neutralization by the immune system; however, multiple defense mechanisms have also evolved to recognize and neutralize pathogens. Even simple [[microorganism|unicellular]] organisms such as [[bacteria]] possess a rudimentary immune system in the form of [[enzyme]]s that protect against [[bacteriophage]] infections. Other basic immune mechanisms evolved in ancient [[eukaryote]]s and remain in their modern descendants, such as plants and invertebrates. These mechanisms include [[phagocytosis]], [[antimicrobial peptides]] called [[defensin]]s, and the [[complement system]]. [[Jawed vertebrate]]s, including humans, have even more sophisticated defense mechanisms,<ref name=Beck>{{cite journal | last1 = Beck | first1 = Gregory | first2 =Gail S. | last2 = Habitat | name-list-format = vanc | title=Immunity and the Invertebrates | journal =Scientific American |pages=60\u201366 |date=November 1996 |url=http://www.scs.carleton.ca/~soma/biosec/readings/sharkimmu-sciam-Nov1996.pdf | accessdate = 1 January 2007 | doi = 10.1038/scientificamerican1196-60 | pmid = 8875808 | volume = 275 | issue = 5| bibcode=1996SciAm.275e..60B }}</ref> including the ability to adapt over time to recognize specific pathogens more efficiently. Adaptive (or acquired) immunity creates [[immunological memory]] after an initial response to a specific pathogen, leading to an enhanced response to subsequent encounters with that same pathogen. This process of acquired immunity is the basis of [[vaccination]].\n\nDisorders of the immune system can result in [[autoimmune disease]]s, [[Inflammation|inflammatory diseases]] and [[Carcinogenesis|cancer]].<ref name=\"pmid11506482\">{{cite journal | vauthors = O'Byrne KJ, Dalgleish AG | title = Chronic immune activation and inflammation as the cause of malignancy | journal = British Journal of Cancer | volume = 85 | issue = 4 | pages = 473\u201383 | date = Aug 2001 | pmid = 11506482 | pmc = 2364095 | doi = 10.1054/bjoc.2001.1943 }}</ref> [[Immunodeficiency]] occurs when the immune system is less active than normal, resulting in recurring and life-threatening infections. In humans, immunodeficiency can either be the result of a [[genetic disease]] such as [[severe combined immunodeficiency]], acquired conditions such as [[HIV]]/[[AIDS]], or the use of immunosuppressive medication. In contrast, [[autoimmunity]] results from a hyperactive immune system attacking normal tissues as if they were foreign organisms. Common autoimmune diseases include [[Hashimoto's thyroiditis]], [[rheumatoid arthritis]], [[diabetes mellitus type 1]], and [[systemic lupus erythematosus]]. [[Immunology]] covers the study of all aspects of the immune system.\n\n== Layered defense ==\nThe immune system protects organisms from [[infection]] with layered defenses of increasing specificity. In simple terms, physical barriers prevent pathogens such as [[bacteria]] and [[virus]]es from entering the organism. If a pathogen breaches these barriers, the [[innate immune system]] provides an immediate, but non-specific response. Innate immune systems are found in all [[plant]]s and [[animal]]s.<ref name=Litman>{{cite journal | vauthors = Litman GW, Cannon JP, Dishaw LJ | title = Reconstructing immune phylogeny: new perspectives | journal = Nature Reviews.

Here, the immune system adapts its response during an infection to improve its recognition of the pathogen.

First, during the early slow-wave-sleep stage, a sudden drop in blood levels of [[cortisol]], [[epinephrine]], and [[norepinephrine]] induce increased blood levels of the hormones leptin, pituitary growth hormone, and prolactin. These signals induce a pro-inflammatory state through the production of the pro-inflammatory cytokines interleukin-1, [[interleukin-12]], [[TNF-alpha]] and [[IFN-gamma]]. These cytokines then stimulate immune functions such as immune cells activation, proliferation, and differentiation. It is during this time that undifferentiated, or less differentiated, like na\u00efve and central memory T cells, peak (i.e. during a time of a slowly evolving adaptive immune response).  In addition to these effects, the milieu of hormones produced at this time (leptin, pituitary growth hormone, and prolactin) support the interactions between APCs and T-cells, a shift of the [[Th1 cell|T<sub>h</sub>1/T<sub>h</sub>2]] cytokine balance towards one that supports T<sub>h</sub>1, an increase in overall T<sub>h</sub> cell proliferation, and na\u00efve T cell migration to lymph nodes. This milieu is also thought to support the formation of long-lasting immune memory through the initiation of Th1 immune responses.<ref name=\"Sleep and immune function\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Besedovsky L, Lange T, Born J | title = Sleep and immune function | journal = Pfl\u00fcgers Archiv | volume = 463 | issue = 1 | pages = 121\u201337 | date = Jan 2012 | pmid = 22071480 | doi = 10.1007/s00424-011-1044-0 | pmc=3256323}}</ref>\n\nIn contrast, during wake periods differentiated effector cells, such as cytotoxic natural killer cells and CTLs (cytotoxic T lymphocytes), peak in order to elicit an effective response against any intruding pathogens. As well during awake active times, anti-inflammatory molecules, such as cortisol and [[catecholamine]]s, peak. There are two theories as to why the pro-inflammatory state is reserved for sleep time. First, inflammation would cause serious cognitive and physical impairments if it were to occur during wake times. Second, inflammation may occur during sleep times due to the presence of [[melatonin]]. Inflammation causes a great deal of [[oxidative stress]] and the presence of melatonin during sleep times could actively counteract free radical production during this time.<ref name=\"Sleep and immune function\"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.webmd.com/sleep-disorders/excessive-sleepiness-10/immune-system-lack-of-sleep/ |title=Can Better Sleep Mean Catching fewer Colds? |accessdate=28 April 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140509003219/http://www.webmd.com/sleep-disorders/excessive-sleepiness-10/immune-system-lack-of-sleep |archivedate=9 May 2014 }}</ref>\n\n=== Nutrition and diet ===\n[[Overnutrition]] is associated with diseases such as [[diabetes]] and [[obesity]], which are known to affect immune function.

Many theories have been suggested in immunology from the end of the nineteenth century up to the present time. The end of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th century saw a battle between \"cellular\" and \"humoral\" theories of immunity. According to the cellular theory of immunity, represented in particular by [[Elie Metchnikoff]], it was cells\u2014more precisely, phagocytes\u2014that were responsible for immune responses. In contrast, the humoral theory of immunity, held, among others, by [[Robert Koch]] and [[Emil von Behring]], stated that the active immune agents were soluble components (molecules) found in the organism's \u201chumors\u201d rather than its cells.<!--\n     --><ref name=silverstein>{{cite book|last=Silverstein|first=Arthur M. |title=A History of Immunology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=J3Hg4I6GrYoC|year=1989|authorlink=Arthur M.

To function properly, an immune system must detect a wide variety of agents, known as [[pathogen]]s, from [[virus]]es to [[parasitic worm]]s, and [[Major histocompatibility complex|distinguish]] them from the organism's own healthy [[biological tissue|tissue]]. In many species, there are two major subsystems of the immune system: the [[innate immune system]] and the [[adaptive immune system]].  Both subsystems use [[humoral immunity]] and [[cell-mediated immunity]] to perform their functions.  In humans, the [[blood\u2013brain barrier]], [[blood\u2013cerebrospinal fluid barrier]], and similar fluid\u2013brain barriers separate the peripheral immune system from the [[neuroimmune system]], which protects the [[human brain|brain]].\n\nPathogens can rapidly [[evolution|evolve]] and adapt, and thereby avoid detection and neutralization by the immune system; however, multiple defense mechanisms have also evolved to recognize and neutralize pathogens. Even simple [[microorganism|unicellular]] organisms such as [[bacteria]] possess a rudimentary immune system in the form of [[enzyme]]s that protect against [[bacteriophage]] infections.

First, during the early slow-wave-sleep stage, a sudden drop in blood levels of [[cortisol]], [[epinephrine]], and [[norepinephrine]] induce increased blood levels of the hormones leptin, pituitary growth hormone, and prolactin. These signals induce a pro-inflammatory state through the production of the pro-inflammatory cytokines interleukin-1, [[interleukin-12]], [[TNF-alpha]] and [[IFN-gamma]]. These cytokines then stimulate immune functions such as immune cells activation, proliferation, and differentiation. It is during this time that undifferentiated, or less differentiated, like na\u00efve and central memory T cells, peak (i.e. during a time of a slowly evolving adaptive immune response).  In addition to these effects, the milieu of hormones produced at this time (leptin, pituitary growth hormone, and prolactin) support the interactions between APCs and T-cells, a shift of the [[Th1 cell|T<sub>h</sub>1/T<sub>h</sub>2]] cytokine balance towards one that supports T<sub>h</sub>1, an increase in overall T<sub>h</sub> cell proliferation, and na\u00efve T cell migration to lymph nodes. This milieu is also thought to support the formation of long-lasting immune memory through the initiation of Th1 immune responses.<ref name=\"Sleep and immune function\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Besedovsky L, Lange T, Born J | title = Sleep and immune function | journal = Pfl\u00fcgers Archiv | volume = 463 | issue = 1 | pages = 121\u201337 | date = Jan 2012 | pmid = 22071480 | doi = 10.1007/s00424-011-1044-0 | pmc=3256323}}</ref>\n\nIn contrast, during wake periods differentiated effector cells, such as cytotoxic natural killer cells and CTLs (cytotoxic T lymphocytes), peak in order to elicit an effective response against any intruding pathogens. As well during awake active times, anti-inflammatory molecules, such as cortisol and [[catecholamine]]s, peak. There are two theories as to why the pro-inflammatory state is reserved for sleep time. First, inflammation would cause serious cognitive and physical impairments if it were to occur during wake times. Second, inflammation may occur during sleep times due to the presence of [[melatonin]]. Inflammation causes a great deal of [[oxidative stress]] and the presence of melatonin during sleep times could actively counteract free radical production during this time.<ref name=\"Sleep and immune function\"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.webmd.com/sleep-disorders/excessive-sleepiness-10/immune-system-lack-of-sleep/ |title=Can Better Sleep Mean Catching fewer Colds? |accessdate=2014-04-28 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140509003219/http://www.webmd.com/sleep-disorders/excessive-sleepiness-10/immune-system-lack-of-sleep |archivedate=9 May 2014 }}</ref>\n\n=== Nutrition and diet ===\n[[Overnutrition]] is associated with diseases such as [[diabetes]] and [[obesity]], which are known to affect immune function.

The simplest approach is to rapidly change non-essential [[epitope]]s ([[amino acid]]s and/or sugars) on the surface of the pathogen, while keeping essential epitopes concealed.

An example is HIV, which mutates rapidly, so the proteins on its [[viral envelope]] that are essential for entry into its host target cell are constantly changing.

Many theories have been suggested in immunology from the end of the nineteenth century up to the present time. The end of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th century saw a battle between \"cellular\" and \"humoral\" theories of immunity. According to the cellular theory of immunity, represented in particular by [[Elie Metchnikoff]], it was cells\u2014more precisely, phagocytes\u2014that were responsible for immune responses. In contrast, the humoral theory of immunity, held, among others, by [[Robert Koch]] and [[Emil von Behring]], stated that the active immune agents were soluble components (molecules) found in the organism's \u201chumors\u201d rather than its cells.<!--\n     --><ref name=silverstein>{{cite book|last=Silverstein|first=Arthur M. |title=A History of Immunology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=J3Hg4I6GrYoC|year=1989|authorlink=Arthur M.
