/>\n\nWhether the virus is infectious during the [[incubation period]] is uncertain.<ref name=\"ScienceFlawed\" /> On 1 February 2020, the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) indicated that \"transmission from asymptomatic cases is likely not a major driver of transmission\".<ref name=\"WHO-SR12\" /> However, an epidemiological model of the beginning of the [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic in mainland China|outbreak in China]] suggested that \"pre-symptomatic shedding may be typical among documented infections\" and that [[subclinical infection]]s may have been the source of a

humans remains unclear, as does whether the strain became [[pathogen]]ic before or after the [[spillover event]].<ref name=\"early\" /><ref name=\"PopSciJan\" /><ref name=\"Proximal\" /> Because many of the first individuals found to be infected by the virus were workers at the [[Huanan Seafood Market]],<ref name=\"LancetClinical\" /><ref name=\"LancetCharacteristics\" /> it has been suggested that the strain might have originated from the market.<ref name=\"Proximal\" /><ref name=\"nature feb2020\" /> However, other research indicates that visitors may have introduced the virus to the market, which then facilitated rapid expansion of the infections.<ref name=\"early\" /><ref name=\"XivDecoding\" />\n\nResearch into the [[natural reservoir]] of the virus strain that caused the [[2002\u20132004 SARS outbreak]] has resulted in the discovery of many [[Bat SARS-like coronavirus WIV1|SARS-like bat coronaviruses]], most originating in the ''Rhinolophus'' genus of [[horseshoe bats]], and two viral [[nucleic acid sequence]]s found in samples taken from ''[[Chinese rufous horseshoe bat|Rhinolophus sinicus]]'' show a resemblance of 80% to SARS-CoV-2.<ref name=\"MedVirEvolution\" /><ref name=\"NCBI-Bat\" /><ref name=\"NCBI-Bat2\" /> A third viral nucleic acid sequence from ''[[Intermediate horseshoe bat|Rhinolophus affinis]]'', collected in [[Yunnan|Yunnan province]] and designated RaTG13, has a 96% resemblance to SARS-CoV-2.<ref name=\"NatureZhou\" /><ref name=\"NCBI-Bat3\" /> The WHO considers bats the most likely natural reservoir of SARS-CoV-2,<ref name=\"WHOChinaJoint\" /> but differences between the bat coronavirus and SARS-CoV-2 suggest that humans were infected via an intermediate host.<ref name=\"nature feb2020\" />\n\nA [[metagenomic]] study published in 2019 previously revealed that [[Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus|SARS-CoV]], the strain of the virus that causes [[SARS]], was the most widely distributed coronavirus among a sample of [[Sunda pangolin]]s.<ref name=\"VirusesPangolins\" /> On 7 February 2020, it was announced that researchers from [[Guangzhou]] had discovered a [[pangolin]] sample with a viral nucleic acid sequence \"99% identical\" to SARS-CoV-2.<ref name=\"NaturePang\" /> When released, the results clarified that \"the receptor-binding domain of the S protein of the newly discovered Pangolin-CoV is virtually identical to that of 2019-nCoV, with one [[amino acid]] difference.\"<ref name=\"Isolation\" /> Pangolins are protected under Chinese law, but their [[pangolin trade|poaching and trading]] for use in [[traditional Chinese medicine]] remains common.<ref name=\"TelegraphPangolins\" /><ref name=\"NYT-Ban\" />\n\nMicrobiologists and geneticists in [[Texas]] have independently found evidence of [[reassortment]] in coronaviruses suggesting involvement of pangolins in the origin of SARS-CoV-2.<ref name=\"WongRecombination\" /> However, pangolin coronaviruses found to date only share at most 92% of their whole genomes with SARS-CoV-2, making them less similar than RaTG13 to SARS-CoV-2.<ref name=\"CurrentOrigin\" /> This is insufficient to prove pangolins to be the intermediate host; in comparison, the SARS virus responsible for the 2002\u20132004 outbreak shared 99.8% of its genome with a known [[civet]] coronavirus.<ref name=\"nature

It is a [[Positive-sense single-stranded RNA virus|positive-sense single-stranded RNA]] (+ssRNA) virus. Other coronaviruses are capable of causing illnesses ranging from the [[common cold]] to more severe diseases such as [[Middle East respiratory syndrome]] (MERS). It is the seventh known coronavirus to infect people, after [[Human coronavirus 229E|229E]], [[Human coronavirus NL63|NL63]], [[Human coronavirus OC43|OC43]], [[Human coronavirus HKU1|HKU1]], [[Middle East respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus|MERS-CoV]], and the original SARS-CoV.<ref name=\"NEJM-Novel\" />\n\nLike the SARS-related coronavirus strain implicated in the 2003 SARS outbreak, SARS-CoV-2 is a member of the subgenus ''[[Sarbecovirus]]'' ([[beta-CoV]] lineage B).<ref name=\"NextstrainPhylogeny\" /><ref name=\"Wong2019\" /> Its [[RNA]] sequence is approximately 30,000 [[nucleobase|base]]s in length.<ref name=\"gisaid\"/> SARS-CoV-2 is unique among known betacoronaviruses in its incorporation of a polybasic cleavage site, a characteristic known to increase [[pathogenicity]] and [[Basic reproduction number|transmissibility]] in other viruses.<ref name=\"Proximal\" /><ref name=\"CellWalls\" /><ref name=\"AntiviralCleavage\" />\n\nWith a sufficient number of sequenced [[genome]]s, it is possible to reconstruct a [[phylogenetic tree]] of the mutation history of a family of viruses. By 12 January 2020, five genomes of SARS-CoV-2 had been isolated from Wuhan and reported by the [[Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention]] (CCDC) and other institutions;<ref name=\"gisaid\"/><ref name=\"VirologicalInitial\" /> the number of genomes increased to 42 by 30 January 2020.<ref name=\"NextstrainJanuary\" /> A phylogenetic analysis of those samples showed they were \"highly related with at most seven mutations relative to a [[common ancestor]]\", implying that the first human infection occurred in November or December 2019.<ref name=\"NextstrainJanuary\" /> {{As of|2020|March|27|post=,}} 1,495 SARS-CoV-2 genomes sampled on six continents were publicly available.<ref name=\"NextstrainMarch\" />\n\nOn 11 February 2020, the [[International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses]] (ICTV) announced that according to existing rules that compute hierarchical relationships among coronaviruses on the basis of five [[conserved sequence]]s of [[nucleic acid]]s, the differences between what was then called 2019-nCoV and the [[Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus|virus strain from the 2003 SARS outbreak]] were insufficient to make them separate [[viral species]].

of the first individuals found to be infected by the virus were workers at the [[Huanan Seafood Market]],<ref name=\"LancetClinical\" /><ref name=\"LancetCharacteristics\" /> it has been suggested that the strain might have originated from the market.<ref name=\"Proximal\" /><ref name=\"nature feb2020\" /> However, other research indicates that visitors may have introduced the virus to the market, which then facilitated rapid expansion of the infections.<ref name=\"early\" /><ref name=\"XivDecoding\" />\n\nResearch into the [[natural reservoir]] of the virus strain that caused the [[2002\u20132004 SARS outbreak]] has resulted in the discovery of many [[Bat SARS-like coronavirus WIV1|SARS-like bat coronaviruses]], most originating in the ''Rhinolophus'' genus of [[horseshoe bats]], and two viral [[nucleic acid sequence]]s found in samples taken from ''[[Chinese rufous horseshoe bat|Rhinolophus sinicus]]'' show a resemblance of 80% to SARS-CoV-2.<ref name=\"MedVirEvolution\" /><ref name=\"NCBI-Bat\" /><ref name=\"NCBI-Bat2\" /> A third viral nucleic acid sequence from ''[[Intermediate horseshoe bat|Rhinolophus affinis]]'', collected in [[Yunnan|Yunnan province]] and designated RaTG13, has a 96% resemblance to SARS-CoV-2.<ref name=\"NatureZhou\" /><ref name=\"NCBI-Bat3\" /> The WHO considers bats the most likely natural reservoir of SARS-CoV-2,<ref name=\"WHOChinaJoint\" /> but differences between the bat coronavirus and SARS-CoV-2 suggest that humans were infected via an intermediate host.<ref name=\"nature feb2020\" />\n\nA [[metagenomic]] study published in 2019 previously revealed that [[Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus|SARS-CoV]], the strain of the virus that causes [[SARS]], was the most widely distributed coronavirus among a sample of [[Sunda pangolin]]s.<ref name=\"VirusesPangolins\" /> On 7 February 2020, it was announced that researchers from [[Guangzhou]] had discovered a [[pangolin]] sample with a viral nucleic acid sequence \"99% identical\" to SARS-CoV-2.<ref name=\"NaturePang\" /> When released, the results clarified that \"the receptor-binding domain of the S protein of the newly discovered Pangolin-CoV is virtually identical to that of 2019-nCoV, with one [[amino acid]] difference.\"<ref name=\"Isolation\" /> Pangolins are protected under Chinese law, but their [[pangolin trade|poaching and trading]] for use in [[traditional Chinese medicine]] remains common.<ref name=\"TelegraphPangolins\" /><ref name=\"NYT-Ban\" />\n\nMicrobiologists and geneticists in [[Texas]] have independently found evidence of [[reassortment]] in coronaviruses suggesting involvement of pangolins in the origin of SARS-CoV-2.<ref name=\"WongRecombination\" /> However, pangolin coronaviruses found to date only share at most 92% of their whole genomes with SARS-CoV-2, making them less similar than RaTG13 to SARS-CoV-2.<ref name=\"CurrentOrigin\" /> This is insufficient to prove pangolins to be the intermediate host; in comparison, the SARS virus responsible for the 2002\u20132004 outbreak shared 99.8% of its genome with a known [[civet]] coronavirus.<ref name=\"nature

It is a [[Positive-sense single-stranded RNA virus|positive-sense single-stranded RNA]] (+ssRNA) virus. Other coronaviruses are capable of causing illnesses ranging from the [[common cold]] to more severe diseases such as [[Middle East respiratory syndrome]] (MERS). It is the seventh known coronavirus to infect people, after [[Human coronavirus 229E|229E]], [[Human coronavirus NL63|NL63]], [[Human coronavirus OC43|OC43]], [[Human coronavirus HKU1|HKU1]], [[Middle East respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus|MERS-CoV]], and the original SARS-CoV.<ref name=\"NEJM-Novel\" />\n\nLike the SARS-related coronavirus strain implicated in the 2003 SARS outbreak, SARS-CoV-2 is a member of the subgenus ''[[Sarbecovirus]]'' ([[beta-CoV]] lineage B).<ref name=\"NextstrainPhylogeny\" /><ref name=\"Wong2019\" /> Its [[RNA]] sequence is approximately 30,000 [[nucleobase|base]]s in length.<ref name=\"gisaid\"/> SARS-CoV-2 is unique among known betacoronaviruses in its incorporation of a polybasic cleavage site, a characteristic known to increase [[pathogenicity]] and [[Basic reproduction number|transmissibility]] in other viruses.<ref name=\"Proximal\" /><ref name=\"CellWalls\" /><ref name=\"AntiviralCleavage\" />\n\nWith a sufficient number of sequenced [[genome]]s, it is possible to reconstruct a [[phylogenetic tree]] of the mutation history of a family of viruses.

It consists of [[Hiiumaa]] ([[German language|German]], {{lang-sv|Dag\u00f6}}), the second largest [[island]] of Estonia, and several smaller islands near it. The county borders [[L\u00e4\u00e4ne County]] to the east and [[Saare County]] to the south.\n\n== History ==\nHuman habitation of Hiiumaa can be traced back to the 5th millennium BC. [[Mesolithic]] sites in K\u00f5pu peninsula are exemplified by the seal-hunters' settlements. There are several well-preserved grave fields of the [[Iron Age]]. In 1228, the island was first mentioned in written annals under the name ''Dageida''. In 1254, Hiiumaa was divided between the [[Livonian Order]] and the [[Bishopric of \u00d6sel-Wiek]]. In 1563 Hiiumaa was annexed into [[Sweden]]. In 1710, as a result of the [[Great Northern War]] the island went under the control of the [[Russian Empire]]. During [[World War I]], the German military forces occupied Hiiumaa in 1917. In 1918\u20131940 Hiiumaa was part of the Republic of Estonia, then until 1991 occupied by the [[Soviet Union]].\n\nOn demands of the [[Hanseatic League]] a lighthouse was built in [[K\u00f5pu]] (previously known as ''Dagerort'') at the beginning of the 16th century. It is considered the third-oldest continuously operating lighthouse in the world, still showing its light to {{convert|35|mi}} of the sea.\n\nMost of the farm architecture comes from the 19th century. Examples are Mihkli farming complex and Soera farm-museum with historical national artefacts.\n\n== Sights ==\nMost important sights:\n* [[Suurem\u00f5isa, Hiiu County|Suurem\u00f5isa]] manor\n* [[K\u00f5pu Lighthouse]] and ancient graves\n* [[Suursadam]] port\n* [[Tahkuna Lighthouse]] and coastal defences\n* [[Ristna Lighthouse]]\n* [[S\u00e4\u00e4retirp]]\n* [[Saarnaki laid]] and other isles\n* [[K\u00e4rdla]] town\n* [[K\u00e4ina]] church ruins\n* {{ill|Ristim\u00e4gi|lt=Ristim\u00e4gi hill|et|Ristim\u00e4gi (Hiiumaa}}\n* [[Reigi]] church\n* [[K\u00e4rdla meteorite crater]]\n* [[Kassari chapel]], [[Kassari]]\n\n== County government ==\nThe [[County Governments of Estonia|County Government]] ({{lang-et|Maavalitsus}}) is led by [[County Governors of Estonia|Governor]] ({{lang-et|maavanem}}), who is appointed by the [[Government of Estonia]] for a term of five years.

The only urban settlement [[K\u00e4rdla]] is part of [[Hiiumaa Parish]] since 2017.\n\n'''Rural municipalities:'''\n* [[Hiiumaa Parish]] (''includes the town of [[K\u00e4rdla]]'')\n\n== Geography ==\nThe county includes the islands of [[Hiiumaa]] (980&nbsp;km\u00b2) and [[Kassari]] (19&nbsp;km\u00b2) and a number of surrounding islets. The highest point is Tornim\u00e4gi hill (68&nbsp;m), the longest river is Luguse (21&nbsp;km), and the biggest lake is Tihu Suurj\u00e4rv (850,000&nbsp;m\u00b2).\n\nIn the landscapes there can be found pine forests, mixed spruce and deciduous forests, swampy thickets and juniper shrubs, coastal meadows and bogs. The most frequent tree is pine which makes about a half of forests. Pine is followed by birch, spruce and alder. In total, there are about 1,000 species of vascular plants, of which about 100 are under protection. The wildlife of Hiiumaa is remarkable. Out of 30 species of mammals, big game as elk, deer, fox, wild boar and lynx roam the island. There are about 250 species of birds on the island, 195 of them nesting.\n\nAmong the Estonian counties Hiiumaa is the richest in forest \u2013 nearly 60% of the island are wooded areas.

It consists of [[Hiiumaa]] ([[German language|German]], {{lang-sv|Dag\u00f6}}), the second largest [[island]] of Estonia, and several smaller islands near it. The county borders [[L\u00e4\u00e4ne County]] to the east and [[Saare County]] to the south.\n\n== History ==\nHuman habitation of Hiiumaa can be traced back to the 5th millennium BC. [[Mesolithic]] sites in K\u00f5pu peninsula are exemplified by the seal-hunters' settlements. There are several well-preserved grave fields of the [[Iron Age]]. In 1228, the island was first mentioned in written annals under the name ''Dageida''. In 1254, Hiiumaa was divided between the [[Livonian Order]] and the [[Bishopric of \u00d6sel-Wiek]]. In 1563 Hiiumaa was annexed into [[Sweden]]. In 1710, as a result of the [[Great Northern War]] the island went under the control of the [[Russian Empire]]. During [[World War I]], the German military forces occupied Hiiumaa in 1917. In 1918\u20131940 Hiiumaa was part of the Republic of Estonia, then until 1991 occupied by the [[Soviet Union]].\n\nOn demands of the [[Hanseatic League]] a lighthouse was built in [[K\u00f5pu]] (previously known as ''Dagerort'') at the beginning of the 16th century. It is considered the third-oldest continuously operating lighthouse in the world, still showing its light to {{convert|35|mi}} of the sea.\n\nMost of the farm architecture comes from the 19th century. Examples are Mihkli farming complex and Soera farm-museum with historical national artefacts.\n\n== Sights ==\nMost important sights:\n* [[Suurem\u00f5isa, Hiiu County|Suurem\u00f5isa]] manor\n* [[K\u00f5pu Lighthouse]] and ancient graves\n* [[Suursadam]] port\n* [[Tahkuna Lighthouse]] and coastal defences\n* [[Ristna Lighthouse]]\n* [[S\u00e4\u00e4retirp]]\n* [[Saarnaki laid]] and other isles\n* [[K\u00e4rdla]] town\n* [[K\u00e4ina]] church ruins\n* {{ill|Ristim\u00e4gi|lt=Ristim\u00e4gi hill|et|Ristim\u00e4gi (Hiiumaa}}\n* [[Reigi]] church\n* [[K\u00e4rdla meteorite crater]]\n* [[Kassari chapel]], [[Kassari]]\n\n== County government ==\nThe [[County Governments of Estonia|County Government]] ({{lang-et|Maavalitsus}}) is led by [[County Governors of Estonia|Governor]] ({{lang-et|maavanem}}), who is appointed by the [[Government of Estonia]] for a term of five years.

The only urban settlement [[K\u00e4rdla]] is part of [[Hiiumaa Parish]] since 2017.\n\n'''Rural municipalities:'''\n* [[Hiiumaa Parish]] (''includes the town of [[K\u00e4rdla]]'')\n\n== Geography ==\nThe county includes the islands of [[Hiiumaa]] (980&nbsp;km\u00b2) and [[Kassari]] (19&nbsp;km\u00b2) and a number of surrounding islets. The highest point is Tornim\u00e4gi hill (68&nbsp;m), the longest river is Luguse (21&nbsp;km), and the biggest lake is Tihu Suurj\u00e4rv (850,000&nbsp;m\u00b2).\n\nIn the landscapes there can be found pine forests, mixed spruce and deciduous forests, swampy thickets and juniper shrubs, coastal meadows and bogs. The most frequent tree is pine which makes about a half of forests. Pine is followed by birch, spruce and alder. In total, there are about 1,000 species of vascular plants, of which about 100 are under protection. The wildlife of Hiiumaa is remarkable. Out of 30 species of mammals, big game as elk, deer, fox, wild boar and lynx roam the island. There are about 250 species of birds on the island, 195 of them nesting.\n\nAmong the Estonian counties Hiiumaa is the richest in forest \u2013 nearly 60% of the island are wooded areas. There are large marsh areas in the middle of the island. The marshes cover about 7% of its area. Cultivated land and settlements take about 23% of the area of the county.\n\n== Gallery ==\n<gallery>\nK\u00f5rgessaare.

The main affected areas are [[Elis (regional unit)|Ilia]] and [[Attica (region)|Attica]].\n\nFollowing the confirmation of the first three cases in Greece, on 27 February all carnival events in the country were initially cancelled, and by 10 March a total of 89 cases had been confirmed in the country, mainly related to people who had travelled to Italy and a group of pilgrims who had travelled to Israel and Egypt, as well as their contacts. Health and state authorities issued precautionary guidelines and recommendations, while measures up to that point were taken locally and included the closure of schools and the suspension of cultural events in the affected areas (particularly [[Elis (regional unit)|Ilia]], [[Achaea]] and [[Zakynthos]]). However, on 10 March, due to the outbreak of the virus in different parts of the country and failure by many to comply with the restrictive measures, the government decided to suspend the operation of educational institutions of all levels nationwide and then, on 13 March, to close down all cafes, bars, museums, shopping centres, sports facilities and restaurants in the country. On 16 March, all retail shops were also closed, two villages in Kozani were quarantined, and all services in all areas of religious worship of any religion or dogma were suspended. On 18 and 19 March, the government announced a series of measures of more than 10 billion euros to support the economy, businesses and employees.\n\nOn 22 March the Greek authorities announced significant restrictions on all nonessential transport and movement across the country, starting from 6 a.m on 23 March. Movement outside the house is permitted only for specific reasons that include moving to or from the workplace, shopping for food or medicine, visiting a doctor or assisting a person in need of help and exercising outside individually or in pairs, among other reasons. Citizens leaving their home are required to carry their police ID or passport, as well as some type of attestation depending on the purpose of travel.

The modern use of \"Umbria\" is due to a renaissance of local identity in the 17th century.\n\n==Italic Umbria==\n{{main|Umbri}}\nBefore its defeat by and assimilation to the Romans, Umbria was a sovereign state populated by a people speaking the [[Umbrian language]]. This circumstance prevailed in history during the early and middle [[Roman Republic]]. By the late republic, Umbria was part of Rome. The language was no longer generally spoken.\n\n==Umbria in the geographers of the empire==\nLike any other region, over the centuries ''Region VI'' changed its borders. These changes are reflected in the writings of the imperial geographers.\n\n===Pliny===\nThe ''sexta regio'' is described in some detail by [[Pliny the Elder]].<ref name=III-XIV/>\n\n====Gallia togata====\nGallia Togata went along the northern Adriatic coast of Italy in [[Marche]] from [[Ancona]] to \"this side of Rimini.\" The southernmost point of Gallia Togata is Ancona. He mentions the Aesis River ([[Esino]]) north of there, Senagallia (Sinigaglia), Pisaurum ([[Pesaro]]) and then Fanum ([[Fano]]) at the mouth of the Metaurus ([[Metauro]]) River.\n\nThere follows a folk-etymologic statement concerning the name of the Umbri. People believe, he says, that they are named from the thunderstorms (''imbres'') of the deluge and therefore that they are the oldest people on Earth. (The ancient Greeks and Romans inherited a mythological tradition of a deluge independent of that of the [[Old Testament]].) Some of his further statements appear to be equivocal, leading to some historical misidentification of Gallia Togata. He declares:<blockquote>\"The largest part of this district was occupied by Sicilians and Liburnians especially the territories of Palma, Praetutia and Adria.\"</blockquote>\nThis Adria (''Hadrianus'') is [[Atri, Italy]] on the coast of [[Abruzzi]] south of Ancona. ''Praetutia'' is ''Interamnia Praetutia'', capital city of the Petrutii. From Interamnea comes [[Teramo]] and from Praetutia comes ''Aprutium'', later ''Abruzzo''.<ref>{{cite book |title=The shores of the Adriatic: the Italian side |url=https://archive.org/details/shoresadriatici00jackgoog |first= Frederick Hamilton |last=Jackson | page=[https://archive.org/details/shoresadriatici00jackgoog/page/n33 9] | publisher=John Murray |location=London |year=1906}}</ref> The coast of Abruzzo was in Augustus' Region IV; however, Pliny does not say that the Abruzzo was the largest part of Gallia Togata, only that it was the largest part of the region settled by Sicilians and Liburnians. Similarly if ''Hadrianus'' is taken to be Adria in [[Veneto]] then Gallia Togata would appear to be a synonym for all [[Gallia Cisalpina]]. However, Veneto is not \"this side of Rimini.\"\n\nPliny states his belief that the Umbrians once held the north Adriatic coast, displacing Sicilians and Liburnians, and were in turn displaced by the Etruscans. The Gauls expelled them. Romans colonized the Gallic coast to control it, hence \"togata.\"\n\n====Umbria proper====\nFor Umbria proper Pliny simply lists the settlements: [[Spello]], [[Todi]], [[Amelia, Italy|Amelia]], Attiglio, [[Assisi]], Arna, [[Iesi]], [[Camerino]], Casuentillum, [[Carsulae]], Dolates Sallentini, [[Foligno]], Market of Flaminius, Market of Julius, Market Brenta, [[Fossombrone]], [[Gubbio]], [[Terni]], etc.\n\n===Ptolemy===\nPtolemy, 2nd century geographer, does not lump Gallia Togata together with Umbria, but describes them as separate regions.<ref>{{harvnb|Ptolemy|2nd AD|loc=Book III, Chapter 1}}.</ref>\n\n====Gallia Togata====\nIn Ptolemy, [[Ancona]] is in [[Picenum]]. The strip of country \"above\" the Apennines, \"extending as far as [[Ravenna]],\" is Gallia Togata. Thirteen towns are listed for it, which are south of the [[Po River]], but are as far inland as [[Piacenza]]. This region is somewhat larger than the one of the same name in Augustus' time, comprising almost all of [[Emilia-Romagna]]. The towns are: [[Piacenza]], [[Fidenza]], [[Brescello]], [[Parma]], etc.\n\n====Umbria proper====\nFor the Umbri Ptolemy has only nine towns, omitting some of the major ones: Arna, [[Spello]], [[Todi]], etc.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Umbria]]\n* [[Umbri]]\n* [[Umbrian language]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n* {{cite book |author=Pliny the Elder |authorlink=Pliny the Elder |title=Natural History |date=1st Century AD |ref=CITEREFPliny1st AD}}\n* {{cite book |author=Ptolemy |authorlink=Ptolemy |title=Geography |date=2nd Century AD |ref=CITEREFPtolemy2nd AD}}\n\n{{Coord missing|Italy}}\n\n[[Category:Geographical, historical and cultural regions of Italy]]\n[[Category:History of le Marche]]\n[[Category:History of Umbria]]\n", "text_old": "{{about|Augustus' Regio VI||Umbria (disambiguation)}}\n[[File:Karta \u00f6ver Italien till kejsar Augustus tid, Nordisk familjebok.jpg|thumb|300px|Map of Italy in the time of Augustus, showing the Gallic coast and the places mentioned by Pliny.

The modern use of \"Umbria\" is due to a renaissance of local identity in the 17th century.\n\n==Italic Umbria==\n{{main|Umbri}}\nBefore its defeat by and assimilation to the Romans, Umbria was a sovereign state populated by a people speaking the [[Umbrian language]]. This circumstance prevailed in history during the early and middle [[Roman Republic]]. By the late republic, Umbria was part of Rome. The language was no longer generally spoken.\n\n==Umbria in the geographers of the empire==\nLike any other region, over the centuries ''Region VI'' changed its borders. These changes are reflected in the writings of the imperial geographers.\n\n===Pliny===\nThe ''sexta regio'' is described in some detail by [[Pliny the Elder]].<ref name=III-XIV/>\n\n====Gallia togata====\nGallia Togata went along the northern Adriatic coast of Italy in [[Marche]] from [[Ancona]] to \"this side of Rimini.\" The southernmost point of Gallia Togata is Ancona. He mentions the Aesis River ([[Esino]]) north of there, Senagallia (Sinigaglia), Pisaurum ([[Pesaro]]) and then Fanum ([[Fano]]) at the mouth of the Metaurus ([[Metauro]]) River.\n\nThere follows a folk-etymologic statement concerning the name of the Umbri. People believe, he says, that they are named from the thunderstorms (''imbres'') of the deluge and therefore that they are the oldest people on Earth. (The ancient Greeks and Romans inherited a mythological tradition of a deluge independent of that of the [[Old testament]].) Some of his further statements appear to be equivocal, leading to some historical misidentification of Gallia Togata. He declares:<blockquote>\"The largest part of this district was occupied by Sicilians and Liburnians especially the territories of Palma, Praetutia and Adria.\"</blockquote>\nThis Adria (''Hadrianus'') is [[Atri, Italy]] on the coast of [[Abruzzi]] south of Ancona. ''Praetutia'' is ''Interamnia Praetutia'', capital city of the Petrutii. From Interamnea comes [[Teramo]] and from Praetutia comes ''Aprutium'', later ''Abruzzo''.<ref>{{cite book |title=The shores of the Adriatic: the Italian side |url=https://archive.org/details/shoresadriatici00jackgoog |first= Frederick Hamilton |last=Jackson | page=[https://archive.org/details/shoresadriatici00jackgoog/page/n33 9] | publisher=John Murray |location=London |year=1906}}</ref> The coast of Abruzzo was in Augustus' Region IV; however, Pliny does not say that the Abruzzo was the largest part of Gallia Togata, only that it was the largest part of the region settled by Sicilians and Liburnians. Similarly if ''Hadrianus'' is taken to be Adria in [[Veneto]] then Gallia Togata would appear to be a synonym for all [[Gallia Cisalpina]]. However, Veneto is not \"this side of Rimini.\"\n\nPliny states his belief that the Umbrians once held the north Adriatic coast, displacing Sicilians and Liburnians, and were in turn displaced by the Etruscans. The Gauls expelled them. Romans colonized the Gallic coast to control it, hence \"togata.\"\n\n====Umbria proper====\nFor Umbria proper Pliny simply lists the settlements: [[Spello]], [[Todi]], [[Amelia, Italy|Amelia]], Attiglio, [[Assisi]], Arna, [[Iesi]], [[Camerino]], Casuentillum, [[Carsulae]], Dolates Sallentini, [[Foligno]], Market of Flaminius, Market of Julius, Market Brenta, [[Fossombrone]], [[Gubbio]], [[Terni]], etc.\n\n===Ptolemy===\nPtolemy, 2nd century geographer, does not lump Gallia Togata together with Umbria, but describes them as separate regions.<ref>{{harvnb|Ptolemy|2nd AD|loc=Book III, Chapter 1}}.</ref>\n\n====Gallia Togata====\nIn Ptolemy, [[Ancona]] is in [[Picenum]]. The strip of country \"above\" the Apennines, \"extending as far as [[Ravenna]],\" is Gallia Togata. Thirteen towns are listed for it, which are south of the [[Po River]], but are as far inland as [[Piacenza]]. This region is somewhat larger than the one of the same name in Augustus' time, comprising almost all of [[Emilia-Romagna]]. The towns are: [[Piacenza]], [[Fidenza]], [[Brescello]], [[Parma]], etc.\n\n====Umbria proper====\nFor the Umbri Ptolemy has only nine towns, omitting some of the major ones: Arna, [[Spello]], [[Todi]], etc.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Umbria]]\n* [[Umbri]]\n* [[Umbrian language]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n* {{cite book |author=Pliny the Elder |authorlink=Pliny the Elder |title=Natural History |date=1st Century AD |ref=CITEREFPliny1st AD}}\n* {{cite book |author=Ptolemy |authorlink=Ptolemy |title=Geography |date=2nd Century AD |ref=CITEREFPtolemy2nd AD}}\n\n{{Coord missing|Italy}}\n\n[[Category:Geographical, historical and cultural regions of Italy]]\n[[Category:History of le Marche]]\n[[Category:History of Umbria]]\n", "name_user": "Wbm1058", "label": "safe", "comment": "Spelling correction; redirect bypass fromOld testamenttoOld Testamentusingpopups", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Umbria"}

Jewellery may be attached to the body or the clothes. From a western perspective, the term is restricted to durable [[Ornament (art)|ornaments]], excluding flowers for example. For many centuries metal, often combined with [[gemstone]]s, has been the normal material for jewellery, but other materials such as shells and other plant materials may be used.  It is one of the oldest type of [[archaeological artefact]] \u2013 with 100,000-year-old beads made from ''[[Nassarius]]'' shells thought to be the oldest known jewellery.<ref name=\"bbcnewsdiscovery\">[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/5099104.stm Study reveals 'oldest jewellery'], ''[[BBC News]]'', June 22, 2006.</ref>  The basic forms of jewellery vary between cultures but are often extremely long-lived; in European cultures the most common forms of jewellery listed above have persisted since ancient times, while other forms such as adornments for the nose or ankle, important in other cultures, are much less common.\n\nJewellery may be made from a wide range of materials. [[Gemstone]]s and similar materials such as [[amber]] and [[coral]], [[precious metal]]s, [[bead]]s, and [[seashell|shells]] have been widely used, and [[vitreous enamel|enamel]] has often been important.  In most cultures jewellery can be understood as a status symbol, for its material properties, its patterns, or for meaningful symbols. Jewellery has been made to adorn nearly every body part, from [[hairpin (fashion)|hairpins]] to [[toe ring]]s, and even [[genital jewellery]].  The patterns of wearing jewellery between the sexes, and by children and older people can vary greatly between cultures, but adult women have been the most consistent wearers of jewellery; in modern European culture the amount worn by adult males is relatively low compared with other cultures and other periods in European culture.\n\nThe word ''jewellery'' itself is derived from the word ''jewel'', which was [[anglicisation|anglicised]] from the [[French language|Old French]] \"''jouel''\",<ref>[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/jewel jewel. (n.d.).] Dictionary.com Unabridged (v 1.1). Retrieved on August 7, 2007, from the Dictionary.com website.</ref> and beyond that, to the [[Latin]] word \"''jocale''\", meaning plaything. In [[British English]], [[Indian English]], [[New Zealand English]], [[Hiberno-English]], [[Australian English]], and [[South African English]] it is spelled ''jewellery,'' while the spelling is ''jewelry'' in [[American English]].<ref name=americanbritspelling>see [[American and British English spelling differences#Doubled in British English|American and British spelling differences]]</ref>  Both are used in [[Canadian English]], though ''jewelry'' prevails by a two to one margin. In French and a few other European languages the equivalent term, ''joaillerie'', may also cover decorated metalwork in precious metal such as ''[[objets d'art]]'' and church items, not just objects worn on the person.\n{{toclimit|3}}\n\n==Form and function==\nHumans have used jewellery for a number of different reasons:\n* functional, generally to fix clothing or hair in place\n* as a marker of [[social status]] and personal status, as with a [[wedding ring]]\n* as a signifier of some form of affiliation, whether ethnic, religious or social\n* to provide talismanic protection (in the form of [[amulet]]s)<ref name = KunzMagicJewels>{{cite book | last = Kunz, PhD, DSc | first = George Frederick | title = Magic of Jewels and Charms | publisher = John Lippincott Co.| year = 1917}} URL: [http://www.farlang.com/gemstones/kunz-magic-jewels/page_360 Magic Of jewels: Chapter VII Amulets] [[George Frederick Kunz]] was gemmologist for Tiffany's built the collections of banker J.P.

Numerous cultures store wedding [[dowry|dowries]] in the form of jewellery or make jewellery as a means to store or display coins. Alternatively, jewellery has been used as a currency or trade good;<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/history/ancient/vikings/money_01.shtml|title=BBC - History - Ancient History in depth: Viking Money|access-date=2017-11-10}}</ref> an example being the use of [[slave beads]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.vam.ac.uk/content/articles/t/trade-beads/|title=Trade Beads|last=Web Team|first=Victoria and Albert Museum, Online Museum|date=2011-01-13|website=www.vam.ac.uk|language=en|access-date=2017-11-10}}</ref>\n\nMany items of jewellery, such as [[brooch]]es and [[buckle]]s, originated as purely functional items, but evolved into decorative items as their functional requirement diminished.<ref name=\"kingfisherhistory\">Holland, J. 1999. The Kingfisher History Encyclopedia. ''Kingfisher books''.</ref>\n\nJewellery can also symbolise group membership (as in the case, of the [[Christianity|Christian]] [[crucifix]] or the [[Judaism|Jewish]] [[Star of David]]) or status (as in the case of [[Livery collar|chains of office]], or the Western practice of [[marriage|married]] people wearing wedding rings).\n\nWearing of [[amulet]]s and [[devotional medal]]s to provide protection or ward off evil is common in some cultures. These may take the form of symbols (such as the [[ankh]]), stones, plants, animals, body parts (such as the [[Hamsa|Khamsa]]), or [[glyph]]s (such as stylised versions of the [[Throne Verse]] in [[Islamic art]]).<ref>\nMorris, Desmond.

Platinum [[Alloy|alloys]] range from 900 (90% pure) to 950 (95.0% pure). The silver used in jewellery is usually [[sterling silver]], or 92.5% fine silver. In [[costume jewellery]], [[stainless steel]] findings are sometimes used.\n\nOther commonly used materials include [[glass]], such as fused-glass or [[Vitreous enamel|enamel]]; [[wood]], often carved or turned; [[Exoskeleton|shells]] and other natural animal substances such as [[bone]] and [[ivory]]; natural [[clay]]; [[polymer clay]]; Hemp and other twines have been used as well to create jewellery that has more of a natural feel. However, any inclusion of lead or lead solder will give a British [[Assay office]] (the body which gives U.K. jewellery its stamp of approval, the [[Hallmark]]) the right to destroy the piece, however it is very rare for the assay office to do so.\n\n[[Bead]]s are frequently used in jewellery. These may be made of glass, gemstones, metal, [[wood]], shells, clay and polymer clay. [[beadwork|Beaded jewellery]] commonly encompasses [[necklace]]s, [[bracelet]]s, [[earring]]s, [[belt (clothing)|belts]] and [[ring (jewellery)|rings]]. Beads may be large or small; the smallest type of beads used are known as [[seed bead]]s, these are the beads used for the \"woven\" style of beaded jewellery. Seed beads are also used in an embroidery technique where they are sewn onto fabric backings to create broad collar neck pieces and beaded bracelets. Bead embroidery, a popular type of handwork during the [[Victorian era]], is enjoying a [[renaissance]] in modern jewellery making. Beading, or beadwork, is also very popular in many [[African culture|African]] and indigenous North American cultures.\n\n[[Silversmith]]s, [[goldsmith]]s, and [[Lapidary|lapidaries]] methods include [[forging]], [[Casting (metalworking)|casting]], [[soldering]] or [[welding]], cutting, [[Lapidary|carving]] and \"cold-joining\" (using [[adhesive]]s, [[staple (fastener)|staples]] and [[rivet]]s to assemble parts).<ref>McCreight, Tim.

Diamonds mined during the recent civil wars in [[Angola]], [[Ivory Coast]], [[Sierra Leone]], and other nations have been labelled as [[blood diamond]]s when they are mined in a war zone and sold to finance an [[insurgency]].\n\nThe [[British crown jewels]] contain the [[Cullinan Diamond]], part of the largest gem-quality rough diamond ever found (1905), at 3,106.75 [[Carat (unit)|carats]] (621.35 g).\n[[File:Wedding and Engagement Rings 2151px.jpg|thumb|right|A diamond solitaire engagement ring]]\nNow popular in [[engagement ring]]s, this usage dates back to the marriage of [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor|Maximilian I]] to [[Mary of Burgundy]] in 1477.<ref name=Slate>[http://www.slate.com/id/2167870/ \"Diamonds Are a Girl's Worst Friend:  The trouble with engagement rings.\"] by Meghan O'Rourke at Slate.com on June 11, 2007</ref>\n\nA popular style is the diamond solitaire, which features a single large diamond mounted prominently. <ref>{{cite web |title=What is a Solitaire Setting |url=https://4cs.gia.edu/en-us/blog/what-is-a-diamond-solitaire-setting/ |website=GIA.edu |publisher=Gemological Institute of America |accessdate=21 December 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Other gemstones===\n{{Main article|Gemstone}}\n<gallery widths=\"170px\" heights=\"170px\">\nPair of Earflare Frontals MET DP101928.jpg|[[Jade]]\nEgyptian - Finger Ring with a Representation of Ptah - Walters 42387 - View A.jpg|[[Jasper]]\nFingerring av guld med rubin och rosenstenar, 1700-tal - Hallwylska museet - 110184.tif|[[Ruby]]\nLogan Sapphire SI.jpg|[[Sapphire]]\nClevelandart 1989.39.jpg|[[Turquoise]]\n</gallery>\nMany precious and semiprecious stones are used for jewellery. Among them are:\n\n;[[Amber]]: Amber, an ancient [[organic gemstone]], is composed of tree resin that has hardened over time. The stone must be at least one million years old to be classified as amber, and some amber can be up to 120 million years old.\n;[[Amethyst]]: Amethyst has historically been the most prized gemstone in the quartz family. It is treasured for its purple hue, which can range in tone from light to dark.\n;[[Emerald]]: Emeralds are one of the three main precious gemstones (along with rubies and sapphires) and are known for their fine green to bluish green colour. They have been treasured throughout history, and some historians report that the Egyptians mined emerald as early as 3500 BC.\n;[[Jade]]: Jade is most commonly associated with the colour green but can come in a number of other colours as well. Jade is closely linked to Asian culture, history, and tradition, and is sometimes referred to as the ''stone of heaven''.\n;[[Jasper]]: Jasper is a gemstone of the chalcedony family that comes in a variety of colours. Often, jasper will feature unique and interesting patterns within the coloured stone. Picture jasper is a type of jasper known for the colours (often beiges and browns) and swirls in the stone's pattern.\n;[[Quartz]]: Quartz refers to a family of crystalline gemstones of various colours and sizes.  Among the well-known types of quartz are [[rose quartz]] (which has a delicate pink colour), and smoky quartz (which comes in a variety of shades of translucent brown). A number of other gemstones, such as [[Amethyst]] and [[Citrine quartz|Citrine]], are also part of the quartz family. [[Rutilated quartz]] is a popular type of quartz containing needle-like inclusions.\n;[[Ruby]]: Rubies are known for their intense red colour and are among the most highly valued precious gemstones.  Rubies have been treasured for millennia. In [[Sanskrit]], the word for ruby is ''ratnaraj'', meaning ''king of precious stones''.\n;[[Sapphire]]: The most popular form of sapphire is blue sapphire, which is known for its medium to deep blue colour and strong saturation.  Fancy sapphires of various colours are also available.  In the United States, blue sapphire tends to be the most popular and most affordable of the three major precious gemstones (emerald, ruby, and sapphire).\n;[[Turquoise]]: Turquoise is found in only a few places on earth, and the world's largest turquoise-producing region is the southwest United States.  Turquoise is prized for its attractive colour, most often an intense medium blue or a greenish blue, and its ancient heritage.  Turquoise is used in a great variety of jewellery styles.  It is perhaps most closely associated with southwest and Native American jewellery, but it is also used in many sleek, modern styles.  Some turquoise contains a matrix of dark brown markings, which provides an interesting contrast to the gemstone's bright blue colour.\n\nSome gemstones (like pearls, coral, and amber) are classified as organic, meaning that they are produced by living organisms.  Others are inorganic, meaning that they are generally composed of and arise from minerals.\n\nSome gems, for example, [[amethyst]], have become less valued as methods of extracting and importing them have progressed. Some man-made gems can serve in place of natural gems, such as [[cubic zirconia]], which can be used in place of diamond.<ref>Nassau, K. (1980).''Gems made by man''. {{ISBN|0-8019-6773-2}}</ref>\n\n===Metal finishes===\n[[File:A002.jpg|thumb|right|An example of gold plated jewellery.]]\nFor [[platinum]], [[gold]], and [[silver]] jewellery, there are many techniques to create finishes. The most common are high-polish, satin/matte, [[brushed metal|brushed]], and hammered. High-polished jewellery is the most common and gives the metal a highly reflective, shiny look. Satin, or matte finish reduces the shine and reflection of the jewellery, and this is commonly used to accentuate gemstones such as [[diamond]]s. Brushed finishes give the jewellery a textured look and are created by brushing a material (similar to sandpaper) against the metal, leaving \"brush strokes\". Hammered finishes are typically created by using a rounded steel hammer and hammering the jewellery to give it a wavy [[Surface texture|texture]].\n\nSome jewellery is plated to give it a shiny, reflective look or to achieve a desired colour. Sterling silver jewellery may be plated with a thin layer of 0.999 fine silver (a process known as flashing) or may be plated with rhodium or gold. Base metal costume jewellery may also be plated with silver, gold, or rhodium for a more attractive finish.\n\n==Impact on society==\nJewellery has been used to denote status. In ancient Rome, only certain ranks could wear rings;<ref name=\"Pliny33\">Pliny the Elder. ''The Natural History''. ed. [[John Bostock (physician)|John Bostock]], [[Henry Thomas Riley]], Book XXXIII ''The Natural History of Metals'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Plin.+Nat.+33.1 Online at the Perseus Project] Chapter 4. Accessed July 2006</ref> later, [[sumptuary law]]s dictated who could wear what type of jewellery. This was also based on rank of the citizens of that time. Cultural dictates have also played a significant role. For example, the wearing of earrings by Western men was considered effeminate in the 19th century and early 20th century. More recently, the display of body jewellery, such as [[Body piercing|piercings]], has become a mark of acceptance or seen as a badge of courage within some groups but is completely rejected in others. Likewise, [[hip hop]] culture has popularised the slang term [[bling-bling]], which refers to ostentatious display of jewellery by men or women.\n\nConversely, the jewellery industry in the early 20th century launched a campaign to popularise [[wedding ring]]s for men, which caught on, as well as [[engagement ring]]s for men, which did not, going so far as to create a false history and claim that the practice had medieval roots. By the mid-1940s, 85% of weddings in the U.S. featured a double-ring ceremony, up from 15% in the 1920s.<ref>Howard, Vicky. \"A real Man's Ring: Gender and the Invention of Tradition.\" ''Journal of Social History'', Summer 2003, pp 837\u2013856.</ref> Religion has also played a role in societies influence. Islam, for instance, considers the wearing of gold by men as a social [[Haraam|taboo]],<ref>[[Yusuf al-Qaradawi]]. ''[http://www.witness-pioneer.org/vil/Books/Q_LP/ The Lawful and Prohibited in Islam (online)]''</ref> and many religions have edicts against excessive display.<ref>Greenbaum, Toni. \"SILVER SPEAKS: TRADITIONAL JEWELRY FROM THE MIDDLE EAST\". ''Metalsmith'', Winter2004, Vol. 24, Issue 1, p.56. Greenbaum provides the explanation for the lack of historical examples; the majority of Islamic jewellery was in the form of bridal [[Dowry|dowries]], and traditionally was not handed down from generation to generation; instead, on a woman's death it was sold at the [[souk]] and recycled or sold to passers-by. Islamic jewellery from before the 19th century is thus exceedingly rare.</ref> In Christianity, the New Testament gives injunctions against the wearing of gold, in the writings of the apostles Paul and Peter. In Revelation 17, \"the great whore\" or false religious system, is depicted as being \"decked with gold and precious stones and pearls, having a golden cup in her hand.\" (Rev. 17:4) For Muslims it is considered [[haraam]] for a man to wear [[gold]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Hughes|first1=Patrick|title=Dictionary of Islam|date=1995}}</ref>  Christian denominations forbidding the use of jewelry by both men and women include [[Amish Mennonite|Amish-Mennonite]]s and [[Holiness movement|Holiness]] churches.\n\n==History==\nThe history of jewellery is long and goes back many years, with many different uses among different cultures. It has endured for thousands of years and has provided various insights into how ancient cultures worked.\n\n===Prehistory===\n\nThe earliest known Jewellery was actually created not by humans (''Homo sapiens'') but by [[Neanderthal]] living in Africa. Specifically, perforated beads made from small sea shells have been found dating to 115,000 years ago in the Cueva de los Aviones, a cave along the southeast coast of Spain. Later in Kenya, at [[Enkapune Ya Muto]], beads made from perforated [[ostrich]] egg shells have been dated to more than 40,000 years ago. In Russia, a stone bracelet and marble ring are attributed to a similar age.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.archaeology.org/news//3270-150507-siberia-denisovan-bracelet|title=Stone Bracelet May Have Been Made by Denisovans|year=2015|quote=A stone bracelet unearthed in Denisova Cave in the Altai Mountains of Siberia in 2008 is being called the oldest-known jewelry of its kind. Anatoly Derevyanko, director of the Russian Academy of Sciences\u2019 Institute of Archaeology and Ethnography, and the research team believe that the cave\u2019s Denisovan layers were uncontaminated by human activity from a later period.

In [[Predynastic Egypt]] jewellery soon began to symbolise political and religious power in the community. Although it was worn by wealthy Egyptians in life, it was also worn by them in death, with jewellery commonly placed among [[grave goods]].\n\nIn conjunction with gold jewellery, Egyptians used coloured [[glass]], along with semi-precious gems. The colour of the jewellery had significance. Green, for example, symbolised fertility. [[Lapis lazuli]] and silver had to be imported from beyond the country's borders.\n\nEgyptian designs were most common in [[Phoenicia]]n jewellery. Also, ancient [[Turkey|Turkish]] designs found in [[Persia]]n jewellery suggest that trade between the Middle East and [[Europe]] was not uncommon.

The most significant archaeological evidence comes from the [[Royal Cemetery of Ur]], where hundreds of burials dating 2900\u20132300 BC were unearthed; tombs such as that of [[Puabi]] contained a multitude of artefacts in gold, silver, and semi-precious stones, such as [[lapis lazuli]] crowns embellished with gold figurines, close-fitting collar necklaces, and jewel-headed pins. In [[Assyria]], men and women both wore extensive amounts of jewellery, including [[amulet]]s, ankle bracelets, heavy multi-strand necklaces, and [[cylinder seal]]s.<ref>Nemet-Nejat, ''Daily Life'', 155\u2013157.</ref>\n\nJewellery in Mesopotamia tended to be manufactured from thin metal leaf and was set with large numbers of brightly coloured stones (chiefly agate, lapis, carnelian, and jasper). Favoured shapes included leaves, spirals, cones, and bunches of grapes. Jewellers created works both for human use and for adorning statues and idols. They employed a wide variety of sophisticated metalworking techniques, such as [[cloisonn\u00e9]], [[engraving]], fine [[Granulation (jewellery)|granulation]], and [[filigree]].<ref>Nemet-Nejat, ''Daily Life'', 295\u2013297.</ref>\n\nExtensive and meticulously maintained records pertaining to the trade and manufacture of jewellery have also been unearthed throughout Mesopotamian archaeological sites.

Around 1500 BC, the main techniques of working gold in Greece included casting, twisting bars, and making wire.<ref>{{cite book|title=Jewellery Through 7000 Years|url=https://archive.org/details/jewellerythrough0000brit|url-access=registration|year=1976|publisher=British Museum Publications|isbn=978-0-7141-0054-8|pages=[https://archive.org/details/jewellerythrough0000brit/page/65 65]\u201386}}</ref> Many of these sophisticated techniques were popular in the Mycenaean period, but unfortunately this skill was lost at the end of the Bronze Age. The forms and shapes of jewellery in ancient Greece such as the armring (13th century BC), brooch (10th century BC) and pins (7th century BC), have varied widely since the Bronze Age as well. Other forms of jewellery include wreaths, earrings, necklace and bracelets. A good example of the high quality that gold working techniques could achieve in Greece is the \u2018Gold Olive Wreath\u2019 (4th century BC), which is modeled on the type of wreath given as a prize for winners in athletic competitions like the Olympic Games. Jewellery dating from 600 to 475 BC is not well represented in the archaeological record, but after the Persian wars the quantity of jewellery again became more plentiful.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Deppert-Lippitz, Barbara |author2=Bromberg, Anne R. |author3=Dennis, John |title=Ancient Gold Jewelry at the Dallas Museum of Art|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UUtQAAAAMAAJ|year=1996|publisher=Dallas Museum of Art|isbn=978-0-936227-19-1|chapter=Ch. 4 Europe and Western|pages=88\u201389}}</ref> One particularly popular type of design at this time was a bracelet decorated with snake and animal-heads Because these bracelets used considerably more metal, many examples were made from bronze. By 300 BC, the Greeks had mastered making coloured jewellery and using [[amethyst]]s, [[pearl]], and [[emerald]]s. Also, the first signs of [[cameo (carving)|cameos]] appeared, with the Greeks creating them from [[India]]n [[Sardonyx]], a striped brown pink and cream [[agate]] stone. Greek jewellery was often simpler than in other cultures, with simple designs and workmanship. However, as time progressed, the designs grew in complexity and different materials were soon used.\n\nJewellery in [[Greece]] was hardly worn and was mostly used for public appearances or on special occasions. It was frequently given as a gift and was predominantly worn by women to show their wealth, social status, and beauty. The jewellery was often supposed to give the wearer protection from the \"[[Evil eye|Evil Eye]]\" or endowed the owner with [[supernatural powers]], while others had a religious symbolism. Older pieces of jewellery that have been found were dedicated to the Gods.\n\nThey worked two styles of pieces: cast pieces and pieces hammered out of sheet metal. Fewer pieces of cast jewellery have been recovered. It was made by casting the metal onto two stone or clay moulds. The two halves were then joined together, and [[wax]], followed by molten metal, was placed in the centre. This technique had been practised since the late [[Bronze Age]]. The more common form of jewellery was the hammered sheet type. Sheets of metal would be hammered to thickness and then soldered together. The inside of the two sheets would be filled with wax or another liquid to preserve the metal work. Different techniques, such as using a stamp or engraving, were then used to create motifs on the jewellery. Jewels may then be added to hollows or glass poured into special cavities on the surface.'''\n\nThe Greeks took much of their designs from outer origins, such as Asia, when [[Alexander the Great]] conquered part of it. In earlier designs, other European influences can also be detected. When Roman rule came to Greece, no change in jewellery designs was detected. However, by 27 BC, Greek designs were heavily influenced by the Roman culture. That is not to say that indigenous design did not thrive. Numerous [[polychrome]] butterfly pendants on silver foxtail chains, dating from the 1st century, have been found near [[Olbia]], with only one example ever found anywhere else.<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1163/1570057042596388|title=Polychrome Necklaces from the Late Hellenistic Period|journal=Ancient Civilizations from Scythia to Siberia|volume=10|issue=3|pages=199\u2013257|year=2004|last1=Treister|first1=Mikhail}}</ref>\n\n<gallery widths=\"170px\" heights=\"170px\">\nBee pendant, gold ornament, Chrysolakos necropolis near Malia, 1800-1700 BC, AMH, 144879.jpg|The ''Bees Pendant'', an iconic Minoan jewel; 1700-1600 BC; gold; width: 4.6 cm; from Chrysolakkos (gold pit) complex at [[Malia, Crete|Malia]]; [[Archaeological Museum of Heraklion]] ([[Heraklion]], Greece)<ref>{{cite book|last1=Smith|first1=David Michael|title=Ancient Greece Pocket Museum|date=2017|publisher=Thames and Hudson|isbn=978-0-500-51958-5|page=79|url=|language=en}}</ref>\nGilt terracotta ornaments from a necklace MET DP145718.jpg|Mycenaean necklace; 1400-1050 BC; gilded terracotta; diameter of the rosettes: 2.7 cm, with variations of circa 0.1 cm, length of the pendant 3.7 cm; [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] (New York City)\nGold ring set with an emerald MET DT283.jpg|The Ganymede Jewellery; circa 300 BC; gold; various dimensions; provenance unknown (said to have been found near Thessaloniki (Greece)); Metropolitan Museum of Art\nGreece, 2nd Century BC - Necklace - 1928.234 - Cleveland Museum of Art.tif|Necklace; circa 200 BC; gold, [[moonstone (gemstone)|moonstone]], [[garnet]], [[emerald]], [[cornelian]], [[baroque pearl]] and banded [[agate]]; overall: 39.4 cm; [[Cleveland Museum of Art]] ([[Cleveland]], USA)\n</gallery>\n\n====Etruscan====\n{{main|Etruscan jewelry}}\nGorgons, pomegranates, acorns, lotus flowers and palms were a clear indicator of Greek influence in Etruscan jewelry. The modelling of heads, which was a typical practice from the Greek severe period, was a technique that spread throughout the Etruscan territory. An even clearer evidence of new influences is the shape introduced in the Orientalizing era: The Bullae. A pear shaped vessel used to hold perfume. Its surface was usually decorated with repouss\u00e9 and engraved symbolic figures. \n\nMuch of the jewelry found was not ''worn'' by Etruscans, but were made to accompany them in the after world. Most, if not all, techniques of Etruscan goldsmiths were not invented by them as they are dated to the third millennium BC. \n\n<gallery widths=\"170px\" heights=\"170px\">\nSet of jewelry MET DP122702.jpg|The [[Vulci set of jewelry (Metropolitan Museum of Art)|Vulci set of jewelry]]; early 5th century; gold, glass, rock crystal, [[agate]] and [[carnelian]]; various dimensions; [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] (New York City) \nEarring in the form of a dolphin MET SF43119.jpg|Earring in the form of a dolphin; 5th century BC; gold; 2.1 \u00d7 1.4 \u00d7 4.9 cm; Metropolitan Museum of Art\nEtruscan - Bulla with Daedalus and Icarus - Walters 57371 - Side A.jpg|Bulla with [[Daedalus]] and [[Icarus]]; 5th century BC; gold; 1.6 \u00d7 1 \u00d7 1 cm; [[Walters Art Museum]] ([[Baltimore]], USA)\nEarring MET sf9515205.jpg|Earring; gold and silver; 1.5 \u00d7 0.4 \u00d7 1.4 cm; Metropolitan Museum of Art\n</gallery>\n\n====Rome====\n[[File:Louvre-Lens - L'Europe de Rubens - 026 - Le Grand Cam\u00e9e de France (Gemma Tiberiana), \u00ab L'Apoth\u00e9ose de Germanicus \u00bb.JPG|thumb|left|upright|The ''[[Great Cameo of France]]''; second quarter of the 1st century AD; five-layered [[sardonyx]]; 31 x 26.5 cm; [[Cabinet des m\u00e9dailles]] (Paris)]]\nAlthough jewellery work was abundantly diverse in earlier times, especially among the barbarian tribes such as the [[Celts]], when the Romans conquered most of Europe, jewellery was changed as smaller factions developed the Roman designs. The most common artefact of early Rome was the [[brooch]], which was used to secure clothing together. The Romans used a diverse range of materials for their jewellery from their extensive resources across the continent. Although they used gold, they sometimes used bronze or bone, and in earlier times, glass beads & pearl. As early as 2,000 years ago, they imported [[Sri Lanka]]n [[sapphire]]s and Indian diamonds and used emeralds and [[amber]] in their jewellery. In Roman-ruled [[England]], fossilised [[wood]] called [[Jet (lignite)|jet]] from Northern England was often carved into pieces of jewellery. The early Italians worked in crude gold and created clasps, necklaces, earrings, and bracelets. They also produced larger [[pendant]]s that could be filled with [[perfume]].\n\nLike the Greeks, often the purpose of Roman jewellery was to ward off the \"Evil Eye\" given by other people. Although women wore a vast array of jewellery, men often only wore a finger [[ring (jewellery)|ring]]. Although they were expected to wear at least one ring, some Roman men wore a ring on every finger, while others wore none. Roman men and women wore rings with an [[engraved gem]] on it that was used with wax to seal documents, a practice that continued into [[medieval]] times when [[Monarch|kings]] and noblemen used the same method. After the fall of the Roman Empire, the jewellery designs were absorbed by neighbouring countries and tribes.<ref name=\"last2millionyears\" />\n\n<gallery widths=\"170px\" heights=\"170px\">\nSardonyx cameo portrait of the Emperor Augustus MET DP155547.jpg|[[Cameo (carving)|Cameo]] portrait of the Emperor [[Augustus]]; 41-54 AD; [[sardonyx]]; 3.7 \u00d7 2.9 \u00d7 0.8 cm; [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] (New York City)\nBracelet LACMA 50.22.2.jpg|Bracelet; 1st-2nd century AD; gold-mounted crystal and sardonyx; length: 19.69 cm; [[Los Angeles County Museum of Art]] ([[Los Angeles]], USA)\nGold Necklace with Medallion Depicting a Goddess LACMA 50.22.20 (1 of 2).jpg|Necklace with a medallion depicting a goddess; 30-300; green glass (the green beads) and gold; length: 43.82 cm; Los Angeles County Museum of Art\nGold jewelery, head of Medusa, 200-300 AD, AM Agrigento, 120998.jpg|Openwork hairnet with the head of [[Medusa]]; 200-300; gold; Archaeological Museum of Agrigento ([[Agrigento]], Italy)\n</gallery>\n\n==== Middle Ages ====\n[[File:Officina costantinopolitana, tesoro di asyut (egitto), V-VI sec ca. 01 collier.JPG|thumb|Byzantine collier; late 6th-7th century; gold, [[emerald]]s, [[sapphire]]s, [[amethyst]]s and [[pearl]]s; diameter: 23 cm; from a [[Constantinopol|Constantinopolitan]] workshop; [[Antikensammlung Berlin]] ([[Berlin]], Germany)]]\nPost-Roman Europe continued to develop jewellery making skills. The [[Celts]] and [[Merovingians]] in particular are noted for their jewellery, which in terms of quality matched or exceeded that of the [[Byzantine Empire]]. Clothing fasteners, amulets, and, to a lesser extent, [[signet ring]]s, are the most common artefacts known to us. A particularly striking Celtic example is the [[Tara Brooch]]. The [[Torc]] was common throughout Europe as a symbol of status and power. By the 8th century, jewelled weaponry was common for men, while other jewellery (with the exception of signet rings) seemed to become the domain of women. Grave goods found in a 6th\u20137th century burial near [[Chalon-sur-Sa\u00f4ne]] are illustrative. A young girl was buried with: 2 silver [[Fibula (brooch)|fibulae]], a necklace (with coins), bracelet, gold earrings, a pair of hair-pins, comb, and buckle.<ref>Duby Georges and Philippe Ari\u00e8s, eds.

Unlike the Romans, the Franks, and the Celts, however, Byzantium used light-weight gold leaf rather than solid gold, and more emphasis was placed on stones and gems. As in the West, Byzantine jewellery was worn by wealthier females, with male jewellery apparently restricted to signet rings. Woman's jewellery had some peculiarities like [[kolt]]s that decorated [[headband]].\nLike other contemporary cultures, jewellery was commonly buried with its owner.<ref name=\"Byzantium\">Sherrard, P.

By the 17th century, increasing exploration and trade led to increased availability of a wide variety of gemstones as well as exposure to the art of other cultures. Whereas prior to this the working of gold and precious metal had been at the forefront of jewellery, this period saw increasing dominance of gemstones and their settings. An example of this is the [[Cheapside Hoard]], the stock of a jeweller hidden in [[London]] during the [[Commonwealth of England|Commonwealth]] period and not found again until 1912. It contained Colombian [[emerald]], [[topaz]], [[amazonite]] from Brazil, [[spinel]], [[iolite]], and [[chrysoberyl]] from Sri Lanka, [[ruby]] from India, Afghan [[lapis lazuli]], [[Iran|Persian]] [[turquoise]], Red Sea [[peridot]], as well as Bohemian and Hungarian [[opal]], [[garnet]], and [[amethyst]]. Large stones were frequently set in box-bezels on enamelled rings.<ref>Scarisbrick, Diana. ''Rings: Symbols of Wealth, Power, and Affection''. New York: Abrams, 1993. {{ISBN|0-8109-3775-1}} p.&nbsp;77.</ref> Notable among merchants of the period was [[Jean-Baptiste Tavernier]], who brought the precursor stone of the [[Hope Diamond]] to France in the 1660s.\n\nWhen [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon Bonaparte]] was crowned as Emperor of the French in 1804, he revived the style and grandeur of jewellery and fashion in France. Under Napoleon's rule, jewellers introduced ''[[parure]]s'', suites of matching jewellery, such as a diamond [[tiara]], diamond [[earring]]s, diamond rings, a diamond brooch, and a diamond necklace. Both of Napoleon's wives had beautiful sets such as these and wore them regularly. Another fashion trend resurrected by Napoleon was the [[cameo (carving)|cameo]]. Soon after his cameo decorated crown was seen, cameos were highly sought. The period also saw the early stages of [[costume jewellery]], with [[Scale (zoology)|fish scale]] covered glass beads in place of [[pearl]]s or [[conch]] shell cameos instead of stone cameos. New terms were coined to differentiate the arts: jewellers who worked in cheaper materials were called ''bijoutiers'', while jewellers who worked with expensive materials were called ''joailliers'', a practice which continues to this day.\n{{clear}}\n\n====Romanticism====\n[[File:Russia, 19th century - Earring - 1916.546.1 - Cleveland Museum of Art.jpg|thumb|upright|Russian earring; 19th century; silver, enamel and red glass beads; overall: 6.4 x 2.6 cm; [[Cleveland Museum of Art]] ([[Cleveland]], USA)]]\nStarting in the late 18th century, [[Romanticism]] had a profound impact on the development of western jewellery. Perhaps the most significant influences were the public's fascination with the treasures being discovered through the birth of modern [[archaeology]] and a fascination with Medieval and Renaissance art. Changing social conditions and the onset of the [[Industrial Revolution]] also led to growth of a middle class that wanted and could afford jewellery. As a result, the use of industrial processes, cheaper alloys, and stone substitutes led to the development of paste or [[costume jewellery]]. Distinguished goldsmiths continued to flourish, however, as wealthier patrons sought to ensure that what they wore still stood apart from the jewellery of the masses, not only through use of precious metals and stones but also though superior artistic and technical work. One such artist was the French goldsmith [[Fran\u00e7ois-D\u00e9sir\u00e9 Froment-Meurice]]. A category unique to this period and quite appropriate to the philosophy of romanticism was mourning jewellery. It originated in England, where [[Queen Victoria]] was often seen wearing [[Jet (lignite)|jet]] jewellery after the death of [[Albert, Prince Consort|Prince Albert]], and it allowed the wearer to continue wearing jewellery while expressing a state of mourning at the death of a loved one.<ref name = \"1000facts\"/>\n\nIn the United States, this period saw the founding in 1837 of [[Tiffany & Co.]] by [[Charles Lewis Tiffany]]. Tiffany's put the United States on the world map in terms of jewellery and gained fame creating dazzling commissions for people such as the wife of [[Abraham Lincoln]]. Later, it would gain popular notoriety as the setting of the film [[Breakfast at Tiffany's (film)|Breakfast at Tiffany's]]. In France, [[Pierre Cartier (jeweler)|Pierre Cartier]] founded [[Cartier SA]] in 1847, while 1884 saw the founding of [[Bulgari]] in Italy. The modern production studio had been born and was a step away from the former dominance of individual craftsmen and [[patronage]].\n\nThis period also saw the first major collaboration between East and West.

Cameos that were used in connection with jewellery were the attractive trinkets along with many of the small objects such as brooches, ear-rings and scarf-pins. Some of the necklets were made of several pieces joined with the gold chains were in and bracelets were also made sometimes to match the necklet and the brooch. At the end of the Century the jewellery with cut steel intermixed with large crystals was introduced by an Englishman, Matthew Boulton of Birmingham.<ref name=\"A history of feminine fashion\">{{cite book|author1=unknown|title=A history of feminine fashion|publisher=Nabu Pres|isbn= 978-1-289-62694-5|page=71}}</ref>\n\n====Art Nouveau====\n[[File:Ren\u00e9 lailique, pettorale con pavoni, oro, smalti, opali e diamanti, 1898-1900 ca.jpg|thumb|250px|Breastplate with a peacocks; [[Ren\u00e9 Lalique]]; circa 1898-1900; gold, [[Vitreous enamel|enamel]]s, [[opal]]s and diamonds; [[Calouste Gulbenkian Museum]] ([[Lisboa]], Portugal)]]\nIn the 1890s, jewellers began to explore the potential of the growing [[Art Nouveau]] style and the closely related German [[Jugendstil]], British (and to some extent American) [[Arts and Crafts Movement]], Catalan [[Modernisme]], Austro-Hungarian [[Sezession]], Italian \"Liberty\", etc.\n\nArt Nouveau jewellery encompassed many distinct features including a focus on the female form and an emphasis on colour, most commonly rendered through the use of enamelling techniques including basse-taille, champleve, cloisonn\u00e9, and [[plique-\u00e0-jour]].  Motifs included orchids, irises, pansies, vines, swans, peacocks, snakes, dragonflies, mythological creatures, and the female silhouette.\n\n[[Ren\u00e9 Lalique]], working for the Paris shop of [[Samuel Bing]], was recognised by contemporaries as a leading figure in this trend. The [[Darmstadt Artists' Colony]] and [[Wiener Werkst\u00e4tte]] provided perhaps the most significant input to the trend, while in Denmark [[Georg Jensen]], though best known for his [[Silver (household)|Silverware]], also contributed significant pieces. In England, [[Liberty & Co.]], (notably through the [[Cymric (metalware)|Cymric]] designs of [[Archibald Knox (designer)|Archibald Knox]]) and the British arts & crafts movement of [[Charles Robert Ashbee]] contributed slightly more linear but still characteristic designs. The new style moved the focus of the jeweller's art from the setting of stones to the artistic design of the piece itself. Lalique's [[Dragonfly|dragonfly]] design is one of the best examples of this. [[Vitreous enamel|Enamels]] played a large role in technique, while sinuous organic lines are the most recognisable design feature.\n\nThe end of [[World War I]] once again changed public attitudes, and a more sober style developed.<ref>Constantino, Maria.

Covering the period of the 1920s and 1930s, the style has become popularly known as [[Art Deco]]. [[Walter Gropius]] and the German [[Bauhaus]] movement, with their philosophy of \"no barriers between artists and craftsmen\" led to some interesting and stylistically simplified forms. Modern materials were also introduced: plastics and aluminium were first used in jewellery, and of note are the chromed pendants of Russian-born Bauhaus master [[Naum Slutzky]]. Technical mastery became as valued as the material itself. In the West, this period saw the reinvention of granulation by the German [[Elizabeth Treskow]], although development of the re-invention has continued into the 1990s. It is based on the basic shapes.\n\n===Asia===\nIn Asia, the [[Indian subcontinent]] has the longest continuous legacy of jewellery making anywhere,{{citation needed|date=June 2016}} with a history of over 5,000 years.<ref name=\"Untracht, Oppi p15\">Untracht, Oppi.

Early jewellery making in [[China]] started around the same period, but it became widespread with the spread of [[Buddhism]] around 2,000 years ago.\n\n====China====\nThe Chinese used [[silver]] in their jewellery more than gold. Blue [[kingfisher]] [[feather]]s were tied onto early Chinese jewellery and later, blue gems and glass were incorporated into designs. However, [[jade]] was preferred over any other stone. The Chinese revered jade because of the human-like qualities they assigned to it, such as its hardness, durability, and beauty.<ref name=\"kingfisherhistory\" /> The first jade pieces were very simple, but as time progressed, more complex designs evolved.

Because India had an abundant supply of precious metals and gems, it prospered financially through export and exchange with other countries. While European traditions were heavily influenced by waxing and waning empires, India enjoyed a continuous development of art forms for some 5,000 years.<ref name=\"Untracht, Oppi p15\"/> One of the first to start jewellery making were the peoples of the [[Indus Valley Civilization]] (encompassing present-day Pakistan and north and northwest India). By 1500 BC, the peoples of the Indus Valley were creating gold earrings and necklaces, bead necklaces, and metallic [[bangle]]s. Before 2100 BC, prior to the period when metals were widely used, the largest jewellery trade in the Indus Valley region was the [[bead]] trade. Beads in the Indus Valley were made using simple techniques. First, a bead maker would need a rough stone, which would be bought from an eastern stone trader. The stone would then be placed into a hot oven where it would be heated until it turned deep red, a colour highly prized by people of the Indus Valley. The red stone would then be chipped to the right size and a hole bored through it with primitive drills. The beads were then polished. Some beads were also painted with designs. This art form was often passed down through the family. Children of bead makers often learned how to work beads from a young age.  Persian style also played a big role in India's jewellery. Each stone had its own characteristics related to Hinduism.\n\nJewellery in the Indus Valley was worn predominantly by females, who wore numerous clay or shell bracelets on their wrists. They were often shaped like doughnuts and painted black. Over time, clay bangles were discarded for more durable ones. In present-day [[India]], bangles are made out of [[metal]] or glass.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://tamilnadu.com/fashion/bangles.html |title=Bangles|publisher=Tamilnadu.com|date=4 March 2013}}</ref> Other pieces that women frequently wore were thin bands of gold that would be worn on the forehead, earrings, primitive brooches, [[choker]]s, and gold rings. Although women wore jewellery the most, some men in the Indus Valley wore beads. Small beads were often crafted to be placed in men and women's hair. The beads were about one millimetre long.\n\nA female skeleton (presently on display at the National Museum, New Delhi, India) wears a carlinean bangle (bracelet) on her left hand. ''Kada'' is a special kind of bracelet and is widely popular in Indian culture. They symbolize animals such as peacock, elephant, etc.<ref>{{cite news|title=When showstopper Juhi walked down the ramp|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2013-06-08/bollywood/39833107_1_gehna-jewellers-sunil-datwani-ramp|newspaper=Times of India|accessdate=16 June 2013}}</ref>\n\nAccording to Hindu belief, gold and silver are considered as sacred metals. Gold is symbolic of the warm sun, while silver suggests the cool moon. Both are the quintessential metals of Indian jewellery. Pure gold does not oxidise or corrode with time, which is why Hindu tradition associates gold with immortality.  Gold imagery occurs frequently in ancient Indian literature. In the Vedic Hindu belief of cosmological creation, the source of physical and spiritual human life originated in and evolved from a golden womb (hiranyagarbha) or egg (hiranyanda), a metaphor of the sun, whose light rises from the primordial waters.<ref>{{cite book|last=Untracht|first=Oppi|title=Traditional Jewelry of India|year=1997|isbn=978-0-8109-3886-1|pages=278}}</ref>\n\nJewellery had great status with India's royalty; it was so powerful that they established laws, limiting wearing of jewellery to royalty. Only royalty and a few others to whom they granted permission could wear gold ornaments on their feet. This would normally be considered breaking the appreciation of the sacred metals.  Even though the majority of the Indian population wore jewellery, [[Maharaja]]s and people related to royalty had a deeper connection with jewellery. The [[Maharaja]]'s role was so important that the Hindu philosophers identified him as central to the smooth working of the world. He was considered as a divine being, a deity in human form, whose duty was to uphold and protect dharma, the moral order of the universe.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Prior|first1=Katherine|last2=Adamson|first2=John|title=Maharajas' Jewels|year=2000|publisher=Vendome Press|location=New York|isbn=978-0-86565-218-7|pages=12}}</ref>\n\n[[Navaratna]] (nine gems) is a powerful jewel frequently worn by a [[Maharaja]] (Emperor). It is an amulet, which comprises diamond, pearl, ruby, sapphire, emerald, topaz, cat's eye, coral, and hyacinth (red zircon). Each of these stones is associated with a celestial deity, represented the totality of the Hindu universe when all nine gems are together. The diamond is the most powerful gem among the nine stones. There were various cuts for the gemstone. Indian Kings bought gemstones privately from the sellers. Maharaja and other royal family members value gem as Hindu God. They exchanged gems with people to whom they were very close, especially the royal family members and other intimate allies. \n\n[[India]] was the first country to mine [[diamond]]s, with some mines dating back to 296 BC. India traded the diamonds, realising their valuable qualities. Historically, diamonds have been given to retain or regain a lover's or ruler's lost favour, as symbols of tribute, or as an expression of fidelity in exchange for concessions and protection. Mughal emperors and Kings used the diamonds as a means of assuring their immortality by having their names and worldly titles inscribed upon them. Moreover, it has played and continues to play a pivotal role in Indian social, political, economic, and religious event, as it often has done elsewhere. In Indian history, diamonds have been used to acquire military equipment, finance wars, foment revolutions, and tempt defections. They have contributed to the abdication or the decapitation of potentates. They have been used to murder a representative of the dominating power by lacing his food with crushed diamond. Indian diamonds have been used as security to finance large loans needed to buttress politically or economically tottering regimes.  Victorious military heroes have been honoured by rewards of diamonds and also have been used as ransom payment for release from imprisonment or abduction.<ref>{{cite book|last=Prior|first=Katherine|title=Traditional Jewelry of India|year=2000|publisher=Vendome|location=New York|pages=312}}</ref>\nToday, many of the jewellery designs and traditions are used, and jewellery is commonplace in Indian ceremonies and [[Indian wedding|weddings]].<ref name=\"vanished\" />\n\n<gallery widths=\"170\" heights=\"170\">\nPendant with a Siddha(?)

Jewellery making developed in the Americas 5,000 years ago in [[Central America|Central]] and [[South America]]. Large amounts of gold was easily accessible, and the [[Aztec]]s, [[Mixtec]]s, [[Maya civilisation|Mayans]], and numerous Andean cultures, such as the Mochica of Peru, created beautiful pieces of jewellery.\n\nWith the Mochica culture, goldwork flourished. The pieces are no longer simple metalwork, but are now masterful examples of jewellery making. Pieces are sophisticated in their design, and feature inlays of turquoise, mother of pearl, spondylus shell, and amethyst.

Gold jewellery was most common in the Aztec Empire and was often decorated with [[feather]]s from [[Quetzal|Quetzal birds]] and others. In general, the more jewellery an Aztec noble wore, the higher his status or prestige. [[Tlatoani|The Emperor]] and his High Priests, for example, would be nearly completely covered in jewellery when making public appearances.

At the peak of their civilization, the Maya were making jewellery from jade, gold, silver, [[bronze]], and [[copper]]. Maya designs were similar to those of the Aztecs, with lavish headdresses and jewellery. The Maya also traded in precious gems. However, in earlier times, the Maya had little access to metal, so they made the majority of their jewellery out of bone or stone. Merchants and nobility were the only few that wore expensive jewellery in the Maya region, much the same as with the Aztecs.<ref name=\"vanished\" />\n\nIn [[North America]], Native Americans used [[Exoskeleton|shells]], wood, turquoise, and [[soapstone]], almost unavailable in South and Central America.

Native American jewellery reflects the cultural diversity and history of its makers. [[Native American tribes]] continue to develop distinct aesthetics rooted in their personal artistic visions and cultural traditions. Artists create jewellery for adornment, ceremonies, and trade. Lois Sherr Dubin writes, \"[i]n the absence of written languages, adornment became an important element of Indian [Native American] communication, conveying many levels of information.\" Later, jewellery and personal adornment \"...signaled resistance to assimilation. It remains a major statement of tribal and individual identity.\"<ref>Dubin, 17</ref>\n\nWithin the Haida Nation of the Pacific Northwest, copper was used as a form of jewelry for creating bracelets.<ref name=\"Haida Jewelry\">{{cite web |title=Haida Jewelry |url=https://www.historymuseum.ca/cmc/exhibitions/aborig/haida/haacp11e.html |accessdate=22 January 2020}}</ref> \n\n\nMetalsmiths, beaders, carvers, and lapidaries combine a variety of metals, hardwoods, precious and semi-precious gemstones, [[beadwork]], [[quillwork]], teeth, bones, hide, vegetal fibres, and other materials to create jewellery. Contemporary Native American jewellery ranges from hand-quarried and processed stones and shells to computer-fabricated steel and titanium jewellery.\n\n===Pacific===\n{{Main article|Jewellery in the Pacific}}\nJewellery making in the [[Pacific]] started later than in other areas because of recent human settlement. Early Pacific jewellery was made of bone, wood, and other natural materials, and thus has not survived. Most Pacific jewellery is worn above the waist, with headdresses, necklaces, hair pins, and arm and waist belts being the most common pieces.\n\nJewellery in the Pacific, with the exception of Australia, is worn to be a symbol of either fertility or power. Elaborate headdresses are worn by many Pacific cultures and some, such as the inhabitants of [[Papua New Guinea]], wear certain headdresses once they have killed an enemy. Tribesman may wear boar bones through their noses.\n\nIsland jewellery is still very much primal because of the lack of communication with outside cultures. Some areas of Borneo and Papua New Guinea are yet to be explored by Western nations. However, the island nations that were flooded with Western missionaries have had drastic changes made to their jewellery designs. Missionaries saw any type of tribal jewellery as a sign of the wearer's devotion to paganism. Thus many tribal designs were lost forever in the mass conversion to Christianity.<ref name=\"pacific\">Neich, R., Pereira, F. 2004. Pacific Jewellery and Adornment.

The advent of new materials, such as plastics, [[Precious Metal Clay]] (PMC), and colouring techniques, has led to increased variety in styles. Other advances, such as the development of improved [[pearl]] harvesting by people such as [[Mikimoto K\u014dkichi]] and the development of improved quality artificial gemstones such as [[moissanite]] (a [[diamond simulant]]), has placed jewellery within the economic grasp of a much larger segment of the population.\n\nThe [[Art jewellery|\"jewellery as art\"]] movement was spearheaded by artisans such as [[Robert Lee Morris]] and continued by designers such as Gill Forsbrook in the UK. Influence from other cultural forms is also evident. One example of this is [[bling-bling]] style jewellery, popularised by hip-hop and rap artists in the early 21st century, e.g. [[Grill (jewelry)|grills]], a type of jewellery worn over the teeth.\n\n[[File:Shraddha Kapoor at IBJA awards and fashion showcase.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Indian actress [[Shraddha Kapoor]] showcasing a modern Indian-style jewellery]]\nThe late 20th century saw the blending of European design with oriental techniques such as [[Mokume-gane]]. The following are innovations in the decades straddling the year 2000: \"Mokume-gane, hydraulic die forming, anti-clastic [[raising (metalworking)|raising]], [[fold-forming]], reactive metal anodising, shell forms, [[Metal clay|PMC]], [[photoetching]], and [use of] [[CAD/CAM]].\"<ref>McCrieght, Tim.  \"What's New?\" ''Metalsmith'' Spring 2006, Vol. 26 Issue 1, pp. 42\u201345</ref>\n\nAlso, [[3D printing]] as a production technique gains more and more importance. With a great variety of services offering this production method, jewellery design becomes accessible to a growing number of creatives. An important advantage of using 3d printing are the relatively low costs for [[prototype]]s, small batch series or unique and [[Personalization|personalized]] designs. Shapes that are hard or impossible to create by hand can often be realized by 3D printing. Popular materials to print include [[polyamide]], [[steel]] and [[wax]] (latter for further processing). Every printable material has its very own constraints that have to be considered while designing the piece of jewellery using [[3D modelling software]].\n\n[[Art jewellery|Artisan jewellery]] continues to grow as both a hobby and a profession. With more than 17 United States periodicals about beading alone, resources, accessibility, and a low initial cost of entry continues to expand production of hand-made adornments. Some fine examples of artisan jewellery can be seen at [[The Metropolitan Museum of Art]] in [[New York City]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/ajew/hd_ajew.htm|title=Nineteenth-Century American Jewelry|work=metmuseum.org}}</ref>\nThe increase in numbers of students choosing to study jewellery design and production in Australia has grown in the past 20 years, and Australia now has a thriving contemporary jewellery community. Many of these jewellers have embraced modern materials and techniques, as well as incorporating traditional workmanship.\n\nMore expansive use of metal to adorn the wearer, where the piece is larger and more elaborate than what would normally be considered jewellery, has come to be referred to by designers and fashion writers as [[metal couture]].<ref>Mohemad, Dena.

For example, the square represents the Master of the Lodge and the dove represents the Deacon.\n\n== Body modification ==\n[[File:Karen Padaung Girl Portrait.jpg|upright|left|thumb|A [[Kayan (Burma)|Padaung]] girl in Northern Thailand]]\nJewellery used in [[body modification]] can be simple and plain or dramatic and extreme. The use of simple silver studs, rings, and earrings predominates.  Common jewellery pieces such as earrings are a form of body modification, as they are accommodated by creating a small hole in the ear.\n\n[[Kayan (Burma)|Padaung]] women in [[Myanmar]] place large golden rings around their necks. From as early as five years old, girls are introduced to their first neck ring. Over the years, more rings are added. In addition to the twenty-plus pounds of rings on her neck, a woman will also wear just as many rings on her calves.  At their extent, some necks modified like this can reach {{convert|10|\u2013|15|in|cm|abbr=on}} long.  The practice has health impacts and has in recent years declined from cultural norm to tourist curiosity.<ref name=\"ripleys\">Packard, M. (2002). ''[[Ripley's Believe It or Not Special Edition]]''. Scholastic Inc. p. 22.</ref>  Tribes related to the Paduang, as well as other cultures throughout the world, use jewellery to stretch their earlobes or enlarge ear piercings.  In the Americas, [[labret]]s have been worn since before [[First contact (anthropology)|first contact]] by [[Innu]] and [[First Nations]] peoples of the northwest coast.<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1163/1570057042596388|jstor=483428|title=George Catlin among the Nayas: Understanding the Practice of Labret Wearing on the Northwest Coast|journal=Ancient Civilizations from Scythia to Siberia|volume=10|issue=3|pages=199\u2013257|year=2004|last1=Treister|first1=Mikhail}}</ref> [[Lip plate]]s are worn by the African [[Mursi people|Mursi]] and [[Sara people]], as well as some South American peoples.\n\nIn the late twentieth century, the influence of [[modern primitive|modern primitivism]] led to many of these practices being incorporated into western subcultures.  Many of these practices rely on a combination of body modification and decorative objects, thus keeping the distinction between these two types of decoration blurred.\n\nIn many cultures, jewellery is used as a temporary body modifier; in some cases, with hooks or other objects being placed into the recipient's skin.  Although this procedure is often carried out by tribal or semi-tribal groups, often acting under a trance during religious ceremonies, this practice has seeped into western culture.  Many extreme-jewellery shops now cater to people wanting large hooks or spikes set into their skin.  Most often, these hooks are used in conjunction with pulleys to hoist the recipient into the air.  This practice is said to give an erotic feeling to the person and some couples have even performed their marriage ceremony whilst being suspended by hooks.<ref name=\"ripleys\" />\n\n==Jewellery market==\nAccording to a 2007 KPMG study,<ref name = giasummer2007>{{cite journal| last = KPMG India | title= Global Jewelry Consumption | journal= Gems and Gemology | volume= XLIII |issue= Summer 2007| pages=180 | year=2007 }}</ref> the largest jewellery market is the United States with a market share of 30.8%, Japan, India, China, and the Middle East each with 8\u20139%, and Italy with 5%. The authors of the study predict a dramatic change in market shares by 2015, where the market share of the United States will have dropped to around 25%, and China and India will increase theirs to over 13%. The Middle East will remain more or less constant at 9%, whereas Europe's and Japan's marketshare will be halved and become less than 4% for Japan, and less than 3% for the biggest individual European countries, Italy and the UK.\n\n==See also==\n{{div col|colwidth=22em}}\n* [[Art jewelry]]\n* [[Estate jewelry]]\n* [[Heirloom]]\n* [[List of jewellery types]]\n* [[Live insect jewelry]]\n* [[Gemology]]\n* [[Jewellery cleaning]]\n* [[Wire sculpture]]\n* [[Jewelry Television]]\n* [[Jewellery Quarter]]\n* [[Bronze and brass ornamental work]]\n* [[List of topics characterized as pseudoscience]] (healing jewelry)\n* [[Suffrage jewellery]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* Borel, F. 1994.

Jewellery may be attached to the body or the clothes. From a western perspective, the term is restricted to durable [[Ornament (art)|ornaments]], excluding flowers for example. For many centuries metal, often combined with [[gemstone]]s, has been the normal material for jewellery, but other materials such as shells and other plant materials may be used.  It is one of the oldest type of [[archaeological artefact]] \u2013 with 100,000-year-old beads made from ''[[Nassarius]]'' shells thought to be the oldest known jewellery.<ref name=\"bbcnewsdiscovery\">[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/5099104.stm Study reveals 'oldest jewellery'], ''[[BBC News]]'', June 22, 2006.</ref>  The basic forms of jewellery vary between cultures but are often extremely long-lived; in European cultures the most common forms of jewellery listed above have persisted since ancient times, while other forms such as adornments for the nose or ankle, important in other cultures, are much less common.\n\nJewellery may be made from a wide range of materials. [[Gemstone]]s and similar materials such as [[amber]] and [[coral]], [[precious metal]]s, [[bead]]s, and [[seashell|shells]] have been widely used, and [[vitreous enamel|enamel]] has often been important.  In most cultures jewellery can be understood as a status symbol, for its material properties, its patterns, or for meaningful symbols. Jewellery has been made to adorn nearly every body part, from [[hairpin (fashion)|hairpins]] to [[toe ring]]s, and even [[genital jewellery]].  The patterns of wearing jewellery between the sexes, and by children and older people can vary greatly between cultures, but adult women have been the most consistent wearers of jewellery; in modern European culture the amount worn by adult males is relatively low compared with other cultures and other periods in European culture.\n\nThe word ''jewellery'' itself is derived from the word ''jewel'', which was [[anglicisation|anglicised]] from the [[French language|Old French]] \"''jouel''\",<ref>[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/jewel jewel. (n.d.).] Dictionary.com Unabridged (v 1.1). Retrieved on August 7, 2007, from the Dictionary.com website.</ref> and beyond that, to the [[Latin]] word \"''jocale''\", meaning plaything. In [[British English]], [[Indian English]], [[New Zealand English]], [[Hiberno-English]], [[Australian English]], and [[South African English]] it is spelled ''jewellery,'' while the spelling is ''jewelry'' in [[American English]].<ref name=americanbritspelling>see [[American and British English spelling differences#Doubled in British English|American and British spelling differences]]</ref>  Both are used in [[Canadian English]], though ''jewelry'' prevails by a two to one margin. In French and a few other European languages the equivalent term, ''joaillerie'', may also cover decorated metalwork in precious metal such as ''[[objets d'art]]'' and church items, not just objects worn on the person.\n{{toclimit|3}}\n\n==Form and function==\nHumans have used jewellery for a number of different reasons:\n* functional, generally to fix clothing or hair in place\n* as a marker of [[social status]] and personal status, as with a [[wedding ring]]\n* as a signifier of some form of affiliation, whether ethnic, religious or social\n* to provide talismanic protection (in the form of [[amulet]]s)<ref name = KunzMagicJewels>{{cite book | last = Kunz, PhD, DSc | first = George Frederick | title = Magic of Jewels and Charms | publisher = John Lippincott Co.| year = 1917}} URL: [http://www.farlang.com/gemstones/kunz-magic-jewels/page_360 Magic Of jewels: Chapter VII Amulets] [[George Frederick Kunz]] was gemmologist for Tiffany's built the collections of banker J.P.

Numerous cultures store wedding [[dowry|dowries]] in the form of jewellery or make jewellery as a means to store or display coins. Alternatively, jewellery has been used as a currency or trade good;<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/history/ancient/vikings/money_01.shtml|title=BBC - History - Ancient History in depth: Viking Money|access-date=2017-11-10}}</ref> an example being the use of [[slave beads]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.vam.ac.uk/content/articles/t/trade-beads/|title=Trade Beads|last=Web Team|first=Victoria and Albert Museum, Online Museum|date=2011-01-13|website=www.vam.ac.uk|language=en|access-date=2017-11-10}}</ref>\n\nMany items of jewellery, such as [[brooch]]es and [[buckle]]s, originated as purely functional items, but evolved into decorative items as their functional requirement diminished.<ref name=\"kingfisherhistory\">Holland, J. 1999. The Kingfisher History Encyclopedia. ''Kingfisher books''.</ref>\n\nJewellery can also symbolise group membership (as in the case, of the [[Christianity|Christian]] [[crucifix]] or the [[Judaism|Jewish]] [[Star of David]]) or status (as in the case of [[Livery collar|chains of office]], or the Western practice of [[marriage|married]] people wearing wedding rings).\n\nWearing of [[amulet]]s and [[devotional medal]]s to provide protection or ward off evil is common in some cultures. These may take the form of symbols (such as the [[ankh]]), stones, plants, animals, body parts (such as the [[Hamsa|Khamsa]]), or [[glyph]]s (such as stylised versions of the [[Throne Verse]] in [[Islamic art]]).<ref>\nMorris, Desmond.

Platinum [[Alloy|alloys]] range from 900 (90% pure) to 950 (95.0% pure). The silver used in jewellery is usually [[sterling silver]], or 92.5% fine silver. In [[costume jewellery]], [[stainless steel]] findings are sometimes used.\n\nOther commonly used materials include [[glass]], such as fused-glass or [[Vitreous enamel|enamel]]; [[wood]], often carved or turned; [[Exoskeleton|shells]] and other natural animal substances such as [[bone]] and [[ivory]]; natural [[clay]]; [[polymer clay]]; Hemp and other twines have been used as well to create jewellery that has more of a natural feel. However, any inclusion of lead or lead solder will give a British [[Assay office]] (the body which gives U.K. jewellery its stamp of approval, the [[Hallmark]]) the right to destroy the piece, however it is very rare for the assay office to do so.\n\n[[Bead]]s are frequently used in jewellery. These may be made of glass, gemstones, metal, [[wood]], shells, clay and polymer clay. [[beadwork|Beaded jewellery]] commonly encompasses [[necklace]]s, [[bracelet]]s, [[earring]]s, [[belt (clothing)|belts]] and [[ring (jewellery)|rings]]. Beads may be large or small; the smallest type of beads used are known as [[seed bead]]s, these are the beads used for the \"woven\" style of beaded jewellery. Seed beads are also used in an embroidery technique where they are sewn onto fabric backings to create broad collar neck pieces and beaded bracelets. Bead embroidery, a popular type of handwork during the [[Victorian era]], is enjoying a [[renaissance]] in modern jewellery making. Beading, or beadwork, is also very popular in many [[African culture|African]] and indigenous North American cultures.\n\n[[Silversmith]]s, [[goldsmith]]s, and [[Lapidary|lapidaries]] methods include [[forging]], [[Casting (metalworking)|casting]], [[soldering]] or [[welding]], cutting, [[Lapidary|carving]] and \"cold-joining\" (using [[adhesive]]s, [[staple (fastener)|staples]] and [[rivet]]s to assemble parts).<ref>McCreight, Tim.

Among them are:\n\n;[[Amber]]: Amber, an ancient [[organic gemstone]], is composed of tree resin that has hardened over time. The stone must be at least one million years old to be classified as amber, and some amber can be up to 120 million years old.\n;[[Amethyst]]: Amethyst has historically been the most prized gemstone in the quartz family. It is treasured for its purple hue, which can range in tone from light to dark.\n;[[Emerald]]: Emeralds are one of the three main precious gemstones (along with rubies and sapphires) and are known for their fine green to bluish green colour. They have been treasured throughout history, and some historians report that the Egyptians mined emerald as early as 3500 BC.\n;[[Jade]]: Jade is most commonly associated with the colour green but can come in a number of other colours as well. Jade is closely linked to Asian culture, history, and tradition, and is sometimes referred to as the ''stone of heaven''.\n;[[Jasper]]: Jasper is a gemstone of the chalcedony family that comes in a variety of colours. Often, jasper will feature unique and interesting patterns within the coloured stone. Picture jasper is a type of jasper known for the colours (often beiges and browns) and swirls in the stone's pattern.\n;[[Quartz]]: Quartz refers to a family of crystalline gemstones of various colours and sizes.  Among the well-known types of quartz are [[rose quartz]] (which has a delicate pink colour), and smoky quartz (which comes in a variety of shades of translucent brown). A number of other gemstones, such as [[Amethyst]] and [[Citrine quartz|Citrine]], are also part of the quartz family. [[Rutilated quartz]] is a popular type of quartz containing needle-like inclusions.\n;[[Ruby]]: Rubies are known for their intense red colour and are among the most highly valued precious gemstones.  Rubies have been treasured for millennia. In [[Sanskrit]], the word for ruby is ''ratnaraj'', meaning ''king of precious stones''.\n;[[Sapphire]]: The most popular form of sapphire is blue sapphire, which is known for its medium to deep blue colour and strong saturation.  Fancy sapphires of various colours are also available.  In the United States, blue sapphire tends to be the most popular and most affordable of the three major precious gemstones (emerald, ruby, and sapphire).\n;[[Turquoise]]: Turquoise is found in only a few places on earth, and the world's largest turquoise-producing region is the southwest United States.  Turquoise is prized for its attractive colour, most often an intense medium blue or a greenish blue, and its ancient heritage.  Turquoise is used in a great variety of jewellery styles.  It is perhaps most closely associated with southwest and Native American jewellery, but it is also used in many sleek, modern styles.  Some turquoise contains a matrix of dark brown markings, which provides an interesting contrast to the gemstone's bright blue colour.\n\nSome gemstones (like pearls, coral, and amber) are classified as organic, meaning that they are produced by living organisms.  Others are inorganic, meaning that they are generally composed of and arise from minerals.\n\nSome gems, for example, [[amethyst]], have become less valued as methods of extracting and importing them have progressed. Some man-made gems can serve in place of natural gems, such as [[cubic zirconia]], which can be used in place of diamond.<ref>Nassau, K. (1980).''Gems made by man''. {{ISBN|0-8019-6773-2}}</ref>\n\n===Metal finishes===\n[[File:A002.jpg|thumb|right|An example of gold plated jewellery.]]\nFor [[platinum]], [[gold]], and [[silver]] jewellery, there are many techniques to create finishes. The most common are high-polish, satin/matte, [[brushed metal|brushed]], and hammered. High-polished jewellery is the most common and gives the metal a highly reflective, shiny look. Satin, or matte finish reduces the shine and reflection of the jewellery, and this is commonly used to accentuate gemstones such as [[diamond]]s. Brushed finishes give the jewellery a textured look and are created by brushing a material (similar to sandpaper) against the metal, leaving \"brush strokes\". Hammered finishes are typically created by using a rounded steel hammer and hammering the jewellery to give it a wavy [[Surface texture|texture]].\n\nSome jewellery is plated to give it a shiny, reflective look or to achieve a desired colour. Sterling silver jewellery may be plated with a thin layer of 0.999 fine silver (a process known as flashing) or may be plated with rhodium or gold. Base metal costume jewellery may also be plated with silver, gold, or rhodium for a more attractive finish.\n\n==Impact on society==\nJewellery has been used to denote status. In ancient Rome, only certain ranks could wear rings;<ref name=\"Pliny33\">Pliny the Elder. ''The Natural History''. ed. [[John Bostock (physician)|John Bostock]], [[Henry Thomas Riley]], Book XXXIII ''The Natural History of Metals'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Plin.+Nat.+33.1 Online at the Perseus Project] Chapter 4. Accessed July 2006</ref> later, [[sumptuary law]]s dictated who could wear what type of jewellery. This was also based on rank of the citizens of that time. Cultural dictates have also played a significant role. For example, the wearing of earrings by Western men was considered effeminate in the 19th century and early 20th century. More recently, the display of body jewellery, such as [[Body piercing|piercings]], has become a mark of acceptance or seen as a badge of courage within some groups but is completely rejected in others. Likewise, [[hip hop]] culture has popularised the slang term [[bling-bling]], which refers to ostentatious display of jewellery by men or women.\n\nConversely, the jewellery industry in the early 20th century launched a campaign to popularise [[wedding ring]]s for men, which caught on, as well as [[engagement ring]]s for men, which did not, going so far as to create a false history and claim that the practice had medieval roots. By the mid-1940s, 85% of weddings in the U.S. featured a double-ring ceremony, up from 15% in the 1920s.<ref>Howard, Vicky. \"A real Man's Ring: Gender and the Invention of Tradition.\" ''Journal of Social History'', Summer 2003, pp 837\u2013856.</ref> Religion has also played a role in societies influence. Islam, for instance, considers the wearing of gold by men as a social [[Haraam|taboo]],<ref>[[Yusuf al-Qaradawi]]. ''[http://www.witness-pioneer.org/vil/Books/Q_LP/ The Lawful and Prohibited in Islam (online)]''</ref> and many religions have edicts against excessive display.<ref>Greenbaum, Toni. \"SILVER SPEAKS: TRADITIONAL JEWELRY FROM THE MIDDLE EAST\". ''Metalsmith'', Winter2004, Vol. 24, Issue 1, p.56. Greenbaum provides the explanation for the lack of historical examples; the majority of Islamic jewellery was in the form of bridal [[Dowry|dowries]], and traditionally was not handed down from generation to generation; instead, on a woman's death it was sold at the [[souk]] and recycled or sold to passers-by. Islamic jewellery from before the 19th century is thus exceedingly rare.</ref> In Christianity, the New Testament gives injunctions against the wearing of gold, in the writings of the apostles Paul and Peter. In Revelation 17, \"the great whore\" or false religious system, is depicted as being \"decked with gold and precious stones and pearls, having a golden cup in her hand.\" (Rev. 17:4) For Muslims it is considered [[haraam]] for a man to wear [[gold]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Hughes|first1=Patrick|title=Dictionary of Islam|date=1995}}</ref>  Christian denominations forbidding the use of jewellery by both men and women include [[Amish Mennonite|Amish-Mennonite]]s and [[Holiness movement|Holiness]] churches.\n\n==History==\nThe history of jewellery is long and goes back many years, with many different uses among different cultures. It has endured for thousands of years and has provided various insights into how ancient cultures worked.\n\n===Prehistory===\n\nThe earliest known Jewellery was actually created not by humans (''Homo sapiens'') but by [[Neanderthal]] living in Europe. Specifically, perforated beads made from small sea shells have been found dating to 115,000 years ago in the Cueva de los Aviones, a cave along the southeast coast of Spain. Later in Kenya, at [[Enkapune Ya Muto]], beads made from perforated [[ostrich]] egg shells have been dated to more than 40,000 years ago. In Russia, a stone bracelet and marble ring are attributed to a similar age.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.archaeology.org/news//3270-150507-siberia-denisovan-bracelet|title=Stone Bracelet May Have Been Made by Denisovans|year=2015|quote=A stone bracelet unearthed in Denisova Cave in the Altai Mountains of Siberia in 2008 is being called the oldest-known jewelry of its kind.

The soil around the two fragments of the jewelry piece was dated with oxygen isotopic analysis to 40,000 years ago. \"In the same layer, where we found a Denisovan bone, were found interesting things; until then it was believed these were the hallmark of the emergence of Homo sapiens.

In [[Predynastic Egypt]] jewellery soon began to symbolise political and religious power in the community. Although it was worn by wealthy Egyptians in life, it was also worn by them in death, with jewellery commonly placed among [[grave goods]].\n\nIn conjunction with gold jewellery, Egyptians used coloured [[glass]], along with semi-precious gems. The colour of the jewellery had significance. Green, for example, symbolised fertility. [[Lapis lazuli]] and silver had to be imported from beyond the country's borders.\n\nEgyptian designs were most common in [[Phoenicia]]n jewellery. Also, ancient [[Turkey|Turkish]] designs found in [[Persia]]n jewellery suggest that trade between the Middle East and [[Europe]] was not uncommon.

The most significant archaeological evidence comes from the [[Royal Cemetery of Ur]], where hundreds of burials dating 2900\u20132300 BC were unearthed; tombs such as that of [[Puabi]] contained a multitude of artefacts in gold, silver, and semi-precious stones, such as [[lapis lazuli]] crowns embellished with gold figurines, close-fitting collar necklaces, and jewel-headed pins. In [[Assyria]], men and women both wore extensive amounts of jewellery, including [[amulet]]s, ankle bracelets, heavy multi-strand necklaces, and [[cylinder seal]]s.<ref>Nemet-Nejat, ''Daily Life'', 155\u2013157.</ref>\n\nJewellery in Mesopotamia tended to be manufactured from thin metal leaf and was set with large numbers of brightly coloured stones (chiefly agate, lapis, carnelian, and jasper). Favoured shapes included leaves, spirals, cones, and bunches of grapes. Jewellers created works both for human use and for adorning statues and idols. They employed a wide variety of sophisticated metalworking techniques, such as [[cloisonn\u00e9]], [[engraving]], fine [[Granulation (jewellery)|granulation]], and [[filigree]].<ref>Nemet-Nejat, ''Daily Life'', 295\u2013297.</ref>\n\nExtensive and meticulously maintained records pertaining to the trade and manufacture of jewellery have also been unearthed throughout Mesopotamian archaeological sites.

Around 1500 BC, the main techniques of working gold in Greece included casting, twisting bars, and making wire.<ref>{{cite book|title=Jewellery Through 7000 Years|url=https://archive.org/details/jewellerythrough0000brit|url-access=registration|year=1976|publisher=British Museum Publications|isbn=978-0-7141-0054-8|pages=[https://archive.org/details/jewellerythrough0000brit/page/65 65]\u201386}}</ref> Many of these sophisticated techniques were popular in the Mycenaean period, but unfortunately this skill was lost at the end of the Bronze Age. The forms and shapes of jewellery in ancient Greece such as the armring (13th century BC), brooch (10th century BC) and pins (7th century BC), have varied widely since the Bronze Age as well. Other forms of jewellery include wreaths, earrings, necklace and bracelets. A good example of the high quality that gold working techniques could achieve in Greece is the \u2018Gold Olive Wreath\u2019 (4th century BC), which is modeled on the type of wreath given as a prize for winners in athletic competitions like the Olympic Games. Jewellery dating from 600 to 475 BC is not well represented in the archaeological record, but after the Persian wars the quantity of jewellery again became more plentiful.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Deppert-Lippitz, Barbara |author2=Bromberg, Anne R. |author3=Dennis, John |title=Ancient Gold Jewelry at the Dallas Museum of Art|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UUtQAAAAMAAJ|year=1996|publisher=Dallas Museum of Art|isbn=978-0-936227-19-1|chapter=Ch. 4 Europe and Western|pages=88\u201389}}</ref> One particularly popular type of design at this time was a bracelet decorated with snake and animal-heads Because these bracelets used considerably more metal, many examples were made from bronze. By 300 BC, the Greeks had mastered making coloured jewellery and using [[amethyst]]s, [[pearl]], and [[emerald]]s. Also, the first signs of [[cameo (carving)|cameos]] appeared, with the Greeks creating them from [[India]]n [[Sardonyx]], a striped brown pink and cream [[agate]] stone. Greek jewellery was often simpler than in other cultures, with simple designs and workmanship. However, as time progressed, the designs grew in complexity and different materials were soon used.\n\nJewellery in [[Greece]] was hardly worn and was mostly used for public appearances or on special occasions. It was frequently given as a gift and was predominantly worn by women to show their wealth, social status, and beauty. The jewellery was often supposed to give the wearer protection from the \"[[Evil eye|Evil Eye]]\" or endowed the owner with [[supernatural powers]], while others had a religious symbolism. Older pieces of jewellery that have been found were dedicated to the Gods.\n\nThey worked two styles of pieces: cast pieces and pieces hammered out of sheet metal. Fewer pieces of cast jewellery have been recovered. It was made by casting the metal onto two stone or clay moulds. The two halves were then joined together, and [[wax]], followed by molten metal, was placed in the centre. This technique had been practised since the late [[Bronze Age]]. The more common form of jewellery was the hammered sheet type. Sheets of metal would be hammered to thickness and then soldered together. The inside of the two sheets would be filled with wax or another liquid to preserve the metal work. Different techniques, such as using a stamp or engraving, were then used to create motifs on the jewellery. Jewels may then be added to hollows or glass poured into special cavities on the surface.'''\n\nThe Greeks took much of their designs from outer origins, such as Asia, when [[Alexander the Great]] conquered part of it. In earlier designs, other European influences can also be detected. When Roman rule came to Greece, no change in jewellery designs was detected. However, by 27 BC, Greek designs were heavily influenced by the Roman culture. That is not to say that indigenous design did not thrive. Numerous [[polychrome]] butterfly pendants on silver foxtail chains, dating from the 1st century, have been found near [[Olbia]], with only one example ever found anywhere else.<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1163/1570057042596388|title=Polychrome Necklaces from the Late Hellenistic Period|journal=Ancient Civilizations from Scythia to Siberia|volume=10|issue=3|pages=199\u2013257|year=2004|last1=Treister|first1=Mikhail}}</ref>\n\n<gallery widths=\"170px\" heights=\"170px\">\nBee pendant, gold ornament, Chrysolakos necropolis near Malia, 1800-1700 BC, AMH, 144879.jpg|The ''Bees Pendant'', an iconic Minoan jewel; 1700-1600 BC; gold; width: 4.6 cm; from Chrysolakkos (gold pit) complex at [[Malia, Crete|Malia]]; [[Archaeological Museum of Heraklion]] ([[Heraklion]], Greece)<ref>{{cite book|last1=Smith|first1=David Michael|title=Ancient Greece Pocket Museum|date=2017|publisher=Thames and Hudson|isbn=978-0-500-51958-5|page=79|url=|language=en}}</ref>\nGilt terracotta ornaments from a necklace MET DP145718.jpg|Mycenaean necklace; 1400-1050 BC; gilded terracotta; diameter of the rosettes: 2.7 cm, with variations of circa 0.1 cm, length of the pendant 3.7 cm; [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] (New York City)\nGold ring set with an emerald MET DT283.jpg|The Ganymede Jewellery; circa 300 BC; gold; various dimensions; provenance unknown (said to have been found near Thessaloniki (Greece)); Metropolitan Museum of Art\nGreece, 2nd Century BC - Necklace - 1928.234 - Cleveland Museum of Art.tif|Necklace; circa 200 BC; gold, [[moonstone (gemstone)|moonstone]], [[garnet]], [[emerald]], [[cornelian]], [[baroque pearl]] and banded [[agate]]; overall: 39.4 cm; [[Cleveland Museum of Art]] ([[Cleveland]], USA)\n</gallery>\n\n====Etruscan====\n{{main|Etruscan jewelry}}\nGorgons, pomegranates, acorns, lotus flowers and palms were a clear indicator of Greek influence in Etruscan jewelry. The modelling of heads, which was a typical practice from the Greek severe period, was a technique that spread throughout the Etruscan territory. An even clearer evidence of new influences is the shape introduced in the Orientalizing era: The Bullae. A pear shaped vessel used to hold perfume. Its surface was usually decorated with repouss\u00e9 and engraved symbolic figures. \n\nMuch of the jewelry found was not ''worn'' by Etruscans, but were made to accompany them in the after world. Most, if not all, techniques of Etruscan goldsmiths were not invented by them as they are dated to the third millennium BC. \n\n<gallery widths=\"170px\" heights=\"170px\">\nSet of jewelry MET DP122702.jpg|The [[Vulci set of jewelry (Metropolitan Museum of Art)|Vulci set of jewelry]]; early 5th century; gold, glass, rock crystal, [[agate]] and [[carnelian]]; various dimensions; [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] (New York City) \nEarring in the form of a dolphin MET SF43119.jpg|Earring in the form of a dolphin; 5th century BC; gold; 2.1 \u00d7 1.4 \u00d7 4.9 cm; Metropolitan Museum of Art\nEtruscan - Bulla with Daedalus and Icarus - Walters 57371 - Side A.jpg|Bulla with [[Daedalus]] and [[Icarus]]; 5th century BC; gold; 1.6 \u00d7 1 \u00d7 1 cm; [[Walters Art Museum]] ([[Baltimore]], USA)\nEarring MET sf9515205.jpg|Earring; gold and silver; 1.5 \u00d7 0.4 \u00d7 1.4 cm; Metropolitan Museum of Art\n</gallery>\n\n====Rome====\n[[File:Louvre-Lens - L'Europe de Rubens - 026 - Le Grand Cam\u00e9e de France (Gemma Tiberiana), \u00ab L'Apoth\u00e9ose de Germanicus \u00bb.JPG|thumb|left|upright|The ''[[Great Cameo of France]]''; second quarter of the 1st century AD; five-layered [[sardonyx]]; 31 x 26.5 cm; [[Cabinet des m\u00e9dailles]] (Paris)]]\nAlthough jewellery work was abundantly diverse in earlier times, especially among the barbarian tribes such as the [[Celts]], when the Romans conquered most of Europe, jewellery was changed as smaller factions developed the Roman designs. The most common artefact of early Rome was the [[brooch]], which was used to secure clothing together. The Romans used a diverse range of materials for their jewellery from their extensive resources across the continent. Although they used gold, they sometimes used bronze or bone, and in earlier times, glass beads & pearl. As early as 2,000 years ago, they imported [[Sri Lanka]]n [[sapphire]]s and Indian diamonds and used emeralds and [[amber]] in their jewellery. In Roman-ruled [[England]], fossilised [[wood]] called [[Jet (lignite)|jet]] from Northern England was often carved into pieces of jewellery. The early Italians worked in crude gold and created clasps, necklaces, earrings, and bracelets. They also produced larger [[pendant]]s that could be filled with [[perfume]].\n\nLike the Greeks, often the purpose of Roman jewellery was to ward off the \"Evil Eye\" given by other people. Although women wore a vast array of jewellery, men often only wore a finger [[ring (jewellery)|ring]]. Although they were expected to wear at least one ring, some Roman men wore a ring on every finger, while others wore none. Roman men and women wore rings with an [[engraved gem]] on it that was used with wax to seal documents, a practice that continued into [[medieval]] times when [[Monarch|kings]] and noblemen used the same method. After the fall of the Roman Empire, the jewellery designs were absorbed by neighbouring countries and tribes.<ref name=\"last2millionyears\" />\n\n<gallery widths=\"170px\" heights=\"170px\">\nSardonyx cameo portrait of the Emperor Augustus MET DP155547.jpg|[[Cameo (carving)|Cameo]] portrait of the Emperor [[Augustus]]; 41-54 AD; [[sardonyx]]; 3.7 \u00d7 2.9 \u00d7 0.8 cm; [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] (New York City)\nBracelet LACMA 50.22.2.jpg|Bracelet; 1st-2nd century AD; gold-mounted crystal and sardonyx; length: 19.69 cm; [[Los Angeles County Museum of Art]] ([[Los Angeles]], USA)\nGold Necklace with Medallion Depicting a Goddess LACMA 50.22.20 (1 of 2).jpg|Necklace with a medallion depicting a goddess; 30-300; green glass (the green beads) and gold; length: 43.82 cm; Los Angeles County Museum of Art\nGold jewelery, head of Medusa, 200-300 AD, AM Agrigento, 120998.jpg|Openwork hairnet with the head of [[Medusa]]; 200-300; gold; Archaeological Museum of Agrigento ([[Agrigento]], Italy)\n</gallery>\n\n==== Middle Ages ====\n[[File:Officina costantinopolitana, tesoro di asyut (egitto), V-VI sec ca. 01 collier.JPG|thumb|Byzantine collier; late 6th-7th century; gold, [[emerald]]s, [[sapphire]]s, [[amethyst]]s and [[pearl]]s; diameter: 23 cm; from a [[Constantinopol|Constantinopolitan]] workshop; [[Antikensammlung Berlin]] ([[Berlin]], Germany)]]\nPost-Roman Europe continued to develop jewellery making skills. The [[Celts]] and [[Merovingians]] in particular are noted for their jewellery, which in terms of quality matched or exceeded that of the [[Byzantine Empire]]. Clothing fasteners, amulets, and, to a lesser extent, [[signet ring]]s, are the most common artefacts known to us. A particularly striking Celtic example is the [[Tara Brooch]]. The [[Torc]] was common throughout Europe as a symbol of status and power. By the 8th century, jewelled weaponry was common for men, while other jewellery (with the exception of signet rings) seemed to become the domain of women. Grave goods found in a 6th\u20137th century burial near [[Chalon-sur-Sa\u00f4ne]] are illustrative. A young girl was buried with: 2 silver [[Fibula (brooch)|fibulae]], a necklace (with coins), bracelet, gold earrings, a pair of hair-pins, comb, and buckle.<ref>Duby Georges and Philippe Ari\u00e8s, eds.

Unlike the Romans, the Franks, and the Celts, however, Byzantium used light-weight gold leaf rather than solid gold, and more emphasis was placed on stones and gems. As in the West, Byzantine jewellery was worn by wealthier females, with male jewellery apparently restricted to signet rings. Woman's jewellery had some peculiarities like [[kolt]]s that decorated [[headband]].\nLike other contemporary cultures, jewellery was commonly buried with its owner.<ref name=\"Byzantium\">Sherrard, P.

By the 17th century, increasing exploration and trade led to increased availability of a wide variety of gemstones as well as exposure to the art of other cultures. Whereas prior to this the working of gold and precious metal had been at the forefront of jewellery, this period saw increasing dominance of gemstones and their settings. An example of this is the [[Cheapside Hoard]], the stock of a jeweller hidden in [[London]] during the [[Commonwealth of England|Commonwealth]] period and not found again until 1912. It contained Colombian [[emerald]], [[topaz]], [[amazonite]] from Brazil, [[spinel]], [[iolite]], and [[chrysoberyl]] from Sri Lanka, [[ruby]] from India, Afghan [[lapis lazuli]], [[Iran|Persian]] [[turquoise]], Red Sea [[peridot]], as well as Bohemian and Hungarian [[opal]], [[garnet]], and [[amethyst]]. Large stones were frequently set in box-bezels on enamelled rings.<ref>Scarisbrick, Diana. ''Rings: Symbols of Wealth, Power, and Affection''. New York: Abrams, 1993. {{ISBN|0-8109-3775-1}} p.&nbsp;77.</ref> Notable among merchants of the period was [[Jean-Baptiste Tavernier]], who brought the precursor stone of the [[Hope Diamond]] to France in the 1660s.\n\nWhen [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon Bonaparte]] was crowned as Emperor of the French in 1804, he revived the style and grandeur of jewellery and fashion in France. Under Napoleon's rule, jewellers introduced ''[[parure]]s'', suites of matching jewellery, such as a diamond [[tiara]], diamond [[earring]]s, diamond rings, a diamond brooch, and a diamond necklace. Both of Napoleon's wives had beautiful sets such as these and wore them regularly. Another fashion trend resurrected by Napoleon was the [[cameo (carving)|cameo]]. Soon after his cameo decorated crown was seen, cameos were highly sought. The period also saw the early stages of [[costume jewellery]], with [[Scale (zoology)|fish scale]] covered glass beads in place of [[pearl]]s or [[conch]] shell cameos instead of stone cameos. New terms were coined to differentiate the arts: jewellers who worked in cheaper materials were called ''bijoutiers'', while jewellers who worked with expensive materials were called ''joailliers'', a practice which continues to this day.\n{{clear}}\n\n====Romanticism====\n[[File:Russia, 19th century - Earring - 1916.546.1 - Cleveland Museum of Art.jpg|thumb|upright|Russian earring; 19th century; silver, enamel and red glass beads; overall: 6.4 x 2.6 cm; [[Cleveland Museum of Art]] ([[Cleveland]], USA)]]\nStarting in the late 18th century, [[Romanticism]] had a profound impact on the development of western jewellery. Perhaps the most significant influences were the public's fascination with the treasures being discovered through the birth of modern [[archaeology]] and a fascination with Medieval and Renaissance art. Changing social conditions and the onset of the [[Industrial Revolution]] also led to growth of a middle class that wanted and could afford jewellery. As a result, the use of industrial processes, cheaper alloys, and stone substitutes led to the development of paste or [[costume jewellery]]. Distinguished goldsmiths continued to flourish, however, as wealthier patrons sought to ensure that what they wore still stood apart from the jewellery of the masses, not only through use of precious metals and stones but also though superior artistic and technical work. One such artist was the French goldsmith [[Fran\u00e7ois-D\u00e9sir\u00e9 Froment-Meurice]]. A category unique to this period and quite appropriate to the philosophy of romanticism was mourning jewellery.

Cameos that were used in connection with jewellery were the attractive trinkets along with many of the small objects such as brooches, ear-rings and scarf-pins. Some of the necklets were made of several pieces joined with the gold chains were in and bracelets were also made sometimes to match the necklet and the brooch. At the end of the Century the jewellery with cut steel intermixed with large crystals was introduced by an Englishman, Matthew Boulton of Birmingham.<ref name=\"A history of feminine fashion\">{{cite book|author1=unknown|title=A history of feminine fashion|publisher=Nabu Pres|isbn= 978-1-289-62694-5|page=71}}</ref>\n\n====Art Nouveau====\n[[File:Ren\u00e9 lailique, pettorale con pavoni, oro, smalti, opali e diamanti, 1898-1900 ca.jpg|thumb|250px|Breastplate with a peacocks; [[Ren\u00e9 Lalique]]; circa 1898-1900; gold, [[Vitreous enamel|enamel]]s, [[opal]]s and diamonds; [[Calouste Gulbenkian Museum]] ([[Lisboa]], Portugal)]]\nIn the 1890s, jewellers began to explore the potential of the growing [[Art Nouveau]] style and the closely related German [[Jugendstil]], British (and to some extent American) [[Arts and Crafts Movement]], Catalan [[Modernisme]], Austro-Hungarian [[Sezession]], Italian \"Liberty\", etc.\n\nArt Nouveau jewellery encompassed many distinct features including a focus on the female form and an emphasis on colour, most commonly rendered through the use of enamelling techniques including basse-taille, champleve, cloisonn\u00e9, and [[plique-\u00e0-jour]].  Motifs included orchids, irises, pansies, vines, swans, peacocks, snakes, dragonflies, mythological creatures, and the female silhouette.\n\n[[Ren\u00e9 Lalique]], working for the Paris shop of [[Samuel Bing]], was recognised by contemporaries as a leading figure in this trend. The [[Darmstadt Artists' Colony]] and [[Wiener Werkst\u00e4tte]] provided perhaps the most significant input to the trend, while in Denmark [[Georg Jensen]], though best known for his [[Silver (household)|Silverware]], also contributed significant pieces. In England, [[Liberty & Co.]], (notably through the [[Cymric (metalware)|Cymric]] designs of [[Archibald Knox (designer)|Archibald Knox]]) and the British arts & crafts movement of [[Charles Robert Ashbee]] contributed slightly more linear but still characteristic designs. The new style moved the focus of the jeweller's art from the setting of stones to the artistic design of the piece itself. Lalique's [[Dragonfly|dragonfly]] design is one of the best examples of this. [[Vitreous enamel|Enamels]] played a large role in technique, while sinuous organic lines are the most recognisable design feature.\n\nThe end of [[World War I]] once again changed public attitudes, and a more sober style developed.<ref>Constantino, Maria.

Covering the period of the 1920s and 1930s, the style has become popularly known as [[Art Deco]]. [[Walter Gropius]] and the German [[Bauhaus]] movement, with their philosophy of \"no barriers between artists and craftsmen\" led to some interesting and stylistically simplified forms. Modern materials were also introduced: plastics and aluminium were first used in jewellery, and of note are the chromed pendants of Russian-born Bauhaus master [[Naum Slutzky]]. Technical mastery became as valued as the material itself. In the West, this period saw the reinvention of granulation by the German [[Elizabeth Treskow]], although development of the re-invention has continued into the 1990s. It is based on the basic shapes.\n\n===Asia===\nIn Asia, the [[Indian subcontinent]] has the longest continuous legacy of jewellery making anywhere,{{citation needed|date=June 2016}} with a history of over 5,000 years.<ref name=\"Untracht, Oppi p15\">Untracht, Oppi.

Early jewellery making in [[China]] started around the same period, but it became widespread with the spread of [[Buddhism]] around 2,000 years ago.\n\n====China====\nThe Chinese used [[silver]] in their jewellery more than gold. Blue [[kingfisher]] [[feather]]s were tied onto early Chinese jewellery and later, blue gems and glass were incorporated into designs. However, [[jade]] was preferred over any other stone. The Chinese revered jade because of the human-like qualities they assigned to it, such as its hardness, durability, and beauty.<ref name=\"kingfisherhistory\" /> The first jade pieces were very simple, but as time progressed, more complex designs evolved.

Because India had an abundant supply of precious metals and gems, it prospered financially through export and exchange with other countries. While European traditions were heavily influenced by waxing and waning empires, India enjoyed a continuous development of art forms for some 5,000 years.<ref name=\"Untracht, Oppi p15\"/> One of the first to start jewellery making were the peoples of the [[Indus Valley Civilization]] (encompassing present-day Pakistan and north and northwest India). By 1500 BC, the peoples of the Indus Valley were creating gold earrings and necklaces, bead necklaces, and metallic [[bangle]]s. Before 2100 BC, prior to the period when metals were widely used, the largest jewellery trade in the Indus Valley region was the [[bead]] trade. Beads in the Indus Valley were made using simple techniques. First, a bead maker would need a rough stone, which would be bought from an eastern stone trader. The stone would then be placed into a hot oven where it would be heated until it turned deep red, a colour highly prized by people of the Indus Valley. The red stone would then be chipped to the right size and a hole bored through it with primitive drills. The beads were then polished. Some beads were also painted with designs. This art form was often passed down through the family. Children of bead makers often learned how to work beads from a young age.  Persian style also played a big role in India's jewellery. Each stone had its own characteristics related to Hinduism.\n\nJewellery in the Indus Valley was worn predominantly by females, who wore numerous clay or shell bracelets on their wrists. They were often shaped like doughnuts and painted black. Over time, clay bangles were discarded for more durable ones. In present-day [[India]], bangles are made out of [[metal]] or glass.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://tamilnadu.com/fashion/bangles.html |title=Bangles|publisher=Tamilnadu.com|date=4 March 2013}}</ref> Other pieces that women frequently wore were thin bands of gold that would be worn on the forehead, earrings, primitive brooches, [[choker]]s, and gold rings. Although women wore jewellery the most, some men in the Indus Valley wore beads. Small beads were often crafted to be placed in men and women's hair. The beads were about one millimetre long.\n\nA female skeleton (presently on display at the National Museum, New Delhi, India) wears a carlinean bangle (bracelet) on her left hand. ''Kada'' is a special kind of bracelet and is widely popular in Indian culture. They symbolize animals such as peacock, elephant, etc.<ref>{{cite news|title=When showstopper Juhi walked down the ramp|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2013-06-08/bollywood/39833107_1_gehna-jewellers-sunil-datwani-ramp|newspaper=Times of India|accessdate=16 June 2013}}</ref>\n\nAccording to Hindu belief, gold and silver are considered as sacred metals. Gold is symbolic of the warm sun, while silver suggests the cool moon. Both are the quintessential metals of Indian jewellery. Pure gold does not oxidise or corrode with time, which is why Hindu tradition associates gold with immortality.  Gold imagery occurs frequently in ancient Indian literature. In the Vedic Hindu belief of cosmological creation, the source of physical and spiritual human life originated in and evolved from a golden womb (hiranyagarbha) or egg (hiranyanda), a metaphor of the sun, whose light rises from the primordial waters.<ref>{{cite book|last=Untracht|first=Oppi|title=Traditional Jewelry of India|year=1997|isbn=978-0-8109-3886-1|pages=278}}</ref>\n\nJewellery had great status with India's royalty; it was so powerful that they established laws, limiting wearing of jewellery to royalty. Only royalty and a few others to whom they granted permission could wear gold ornaments on their feet. This would normally be considered breaking the appreciation of the sacred metals.  Even though the majority of the Indian population wore jewellery, [[Maharaja]]s and people related to royalty had a deeper connection with jewellery. The [[Maharaja]]'s role was so important that the Hindu philosophers identified him as central to the smooth working of the world. He was considered as a divine being, a deity in human form, whose duty was to uphold and protect dharma, the moral order of the universe.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Prior|first1=Katherine|last2=Adamson|first2=John|title=Maharajas' Jewels|year=2000|publisher=Vendome Press|location=New York|isbn=978-0-86565-218-7|pages=12}}</ref>\n\n[[Navaratna]] (nine gems) is a powerful jewel frequently worn by a [[Maharaja]] (Emperor). It is an amulet, which comprises diamond, pearl, ruby, sapphire, emerald, topaz, cat's eye, coral, and hyacinth (red zircon). Each of these stones is associated with a celestial deity, represented the totality of the Hindu universe when all nine gems are together. The diamond is the most powerful gem among the nine stones. There were various cuts for the gemstone. Indian Kings bought gemstones privately from the sellers. Maharaja and other royal family members value gem as Hindu God. They exchanged gems with people to whom they were very close, especially the royal family members and other intimate allies. \n\n[[India]] was the first country to mine [[diamond]]s, with some mines dating back to 296 BC. India traded the diamonds, realising their valuable qualities. Historically, diamonds have been given to retain or regain a lover's or ruler's lost favour, as symbols of tribute, or as an expression of fidelity in exchange for concessions and protection. Mughal emperors and Kings used the diamonds as a means of assuring their immortality by having their names and worldly titles inscribed upon them. Moreover, it has played and continues to play a pivotal role in Indian social, political, economic, and religious event, as it often has done elsewhere. In Indian history, diamonds have been used to acquire military equipment, finance wars, foment revolutions, and tempt defections. They have contributed to the abdication or the decapitation of potentates. They have been used to murder a representative of the dominating power by lacing his food with crushed diamond. Indian diamonds have been used as security to finance large loans needed to buttress politically or economically tottering regimes.  Victorious military heroes have been honoured by rewards of diamonds and also have been used as ransom payment for release from imprisonment or abduction.<ref>{{cite book|last=Prior|first=Katherine|title=Traditional Jewelry of India|year=2000|publisher=Vendome|location=New York|pages=312}}</ref>\nToday, many of the jewellery designs and traditions are used, and jewellery is commonplace in Indian ceremonies and [[Indian wedding|weddings]].<ref name=\"vanished\" />\n\n<gallery widths=\"170\" heights=\"170\">\nPendant with a Siddha(?)

Large amounts of gold was easily accessible, and the [[Aztec]]s, [[Mixtec]]s, [[Maya civilisation|Mayans]], and numerous Andean cultures, such as the Mochica of Peru, created beautiful pieces of jewellery.\n\nWith the Mochica culture, goldwork flourished. The pieces are no longer simple metalwork, but are now masterful examples of jewellery making. Pieces are sophisticated in their design, and feature inlays of turquoise, mother of pearl, spondylus shell, and amethyst.

In general, the more jewellery an Aztec noble wore, the higher his status or prestige.

At the peak of their civilization, the Maya were making jewellery from jade, gold, silver, [[bronze]], and [[copper]]. Maya designs were similar to those of the Aztecs, with lavish headdresses and jewellery. The Maya also traded in precious gems. However, in earlier times, the Maya had little access to metal, so they made the majority of their jewellery out of bone or stone. Merchants and nobility were the only few that wore expensive jewellery in the Maya region, much the same as with the Aztecs.<ref name=\"vanished\" />\n\nIn [[North America]], Native Americans used [[Exoskeleton|shells]], wood, turquoise, and [[soapstone]], almost unavailable in South and Central America.

Native American jewellery reflects the cultural diversity and history of its makers. [[Native American tribes]] continue to develop distinct aesthetics rooted in their personal artistic visions and cultural traditions. Artists create jewellery for adornment, ceremonies, and trade. Lois Sherr Dubin writes, \"[i]n the absence of written languages, adornment became an important element of Indian [Native American] communication, conveying many levels of information.\" Later, jewellery and personal adornment \"...signaled resistance to assimilation. It remains a major statement of tribal and individual identity.\"<ref>Dubin, 17</ref>\n\nWithin the Haida Nation of the Pacific Northwest, copper was used as a form of jewelry for creating bracelets.<ref name=\"Haida Jewelry\">{{cite web |title=Haida Jewelry |url=https://www.historymuseum.ca/cmc/exhibitions/aborig/haida/haacp11e.html |accessdate=22 January 2020}}</ref> \n\n\nMetalsmiths, beaders, carvers, and lapidaries combine a variety of metals, hardwoods, precious and semi-precious gemstones, [[beadwork]], [[quillwork]], teeth, bones, hide, vegetal fibres, and other materials to create jewellery. Contemporary Native American jewellery ranges from hand-quarried and processed stones and shells to computer-fabricated steel and titanium jewellery.\n\n===Pacific===\n{{Main article|Jewellery in the Pacific}}\nJewellery making in the [[Pacific]] started later than in other areas because of recent human settlement. Early Pacific jewellery was made of bone, wood, and other natural materials, and thus has not survived. Most Pacific jewellery is worn above the waist, with headdresses, necklaces, hair pins, and arm and waist belts being the most common pieces.\n\nJewellery in the Pacific, with the exception of Australia, is worn to be a symbol of either fertility or power. Elaborate headdresses are worn by many Pacific cultures and some, such as the inhabitants of [[Papua New Guinea]], wear certain headdresses once they have killed an enemy. Tribesman may wear boar bones through their noses.\n\nIsland jewellery is still very much primal because of the lack of communication with outside cultures. Some areas of Borneo and Papua New Guinea are yet to be explored by Western nations. However, the island nations that were flooded with Western missionaries have had drastic changes made to their jewellery designs. Missionaries saw any type of tribal jewellery as a sign of the wearer's devotion to paganism. Thus many tribal designs were lost forever in the mass conversion to Christianity.<ref name=\"pacific\">Neich, R., Pereira, F. 2004. Pacific Jewellery and Adornment.

Other advances, such as the development of improved [[pearl]] harvesting by people such as [[Mikimoto K\u014dkichi]] and the development of improved quality artificial gemstones such as [[moissanite]] (a [[diamond simulant]]), has placed jewellery within the economic grasp of a much larger segment of the population.\n\nThe [[Art jewellery|\"jewellery as art\"]] movement was spearheaded by artisans such as [[Robert Lee Morris]] and continued by designers such as Gill Forsbrook in the UK. Influence from other cultural forms is also evident. One example of this is [[bling-bling]] style jewellery, popularised by hip-hop and rap artists in the early 21st century, e.g. [[Grill (jewelry)|grills]], a type of jewellery worn over the teeth.\n\n[[File:Shraddha Kapoor at IBJA awards and fashion showcase.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Indian actress [[Shraddha Kapoor]] showcasing a modern Indian-style jewellery]]\nThe late 20th century saw the blending of European design with oriental techniques such as [[Mokume-gane]]. The following are innovations in the decades straddling the year 2000: \"Mokume-gane, hydraulic die forming, anti-clastic [[raising (metalworking)|raising]], [[fold-forming]], reactive metal anodising, shell forms, [[Metal clay|PMC]], [[photoetching]], and [use of] [[CAD/CAM]].\"<ref>McCrieght, Tim.  \"What's New?\" ''Metalsmith'' Spring 2006, Vol. 26 Issue 1, pp. 42\u201345</ref>\n\nAlso, [[3D printing]] as a production technique gains more and more importance. With a great variety of services offering this production method, jewellery design becomes accessible to a growing number of creatives. An important advantage of using 3d printing are the relatively low costs for [[prototype]]s, small batch series or unique and [[Personalization|personalized]] designs. Shapes that are hard or impossible to create by hand can often be realized by 3D printing. Popular materials to print include [[polyamide]], [[steel]] and [[wax]] (latter for further processing). Every printable material has its very own constraints that have to be considered while designing the piece of jewellery using [[3D modelling software]].\n\n[[Art jewellery|Artisan jewellery]] continues to grow as both a hobby and a profession. With more than 17 United States periodicals about beading alone, resources, accessibility, and a low initial cost of entry continues to expand production of hand-made adornments. Some fine examples of artisan jewellery can be seen at [[The Metropolitan Museum of Art]] in [[New York City]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/ajew/hd_ajew.htm|title=Nineteenth-Century American Jewelry|work=metmuseum.org}}</ref>\nThe increase in numbers of students choosing to study jewellery design and production in Australia has grown in the past 20 years, and Australia now has a thriving contemporary jewellery community. Many of these jewellers have embraced modern materials and techniques, as well as incorporating traditional workmanship.\n\nMore expansive use of metal to adorn the wearer, where the piece is larger and more elaborate than what would normally be considered jewellery, has come to be referred to by designers and fashion writers as [[metal couture]].<ref>Mohemad, Dena. [http://www.pushitmagazine.com/news/manuel-albarren-metal-couture/ \"Manuel Albarran Metal Couture\"].

For example, the square represents the Master of the Lodge and the dove represents the Deacon.\n\n== Body modification ==\n[[File:Karen Padaung Girl Portrait.jpg|upright|left|thumb|A [[Kayan (Burma)|Padaung]] girl in Northern Thailand]]\nJewellery used in [[body modification]] can be simple and plain or dramatic and extreme. The use of simple silver studs, rings, and earrings predominates.  Common jewellery pieces such as earrings are a form of body modification, as they are accommodated by creating a small hole in the ear.\n\n[[Kayan (Burma)|Padaung]] women in [[Myanmar]] place large golden rings around their necks. From as early as five years old, girls are introduced to their first neck ring. Over the years, more rings are added. In addition to the twenty-plus pounds of rings on her neck, a woman will also wear just as many rings on her calves.  At their extent, some necks modified like this can reach {{convert|10|\u2013|15|in|cm|abbr=on}} long.  The practice has health impacts and has in recent years declined from cultural norm to tourist curiosity.<ref name=\"ripleys\">Packard, M. (2002). ''[[Ripley's Believe It or Not Special Edition]]''. Scholastic Inc. p. 22.</ref>  Tribes related to the Paduang, as well as other cultures throughout the world, use jewellery to stretch their earlobes or enlarge ear piercings.  In the Americas, [[labret]]s have been worn since before [[First contact (anthropology)|first contact]] by [[Innu]] and [[First Nations]] peoples of the northwest coast.<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1163/1570057042596388|jstor=483428|title=George Catlin among the Nayas: Understanding the Practice of Labret Wearing on the Northwest Coast|journal=Ancient Civilizations from Scythia to Siberia|volume=10|issue=3|pages=199\u2013257|year=2004|last1=Treister|first1=Mikhail}}</ref> [[Lip plate]]s are worn by the African [[Mursi people|Mursi]] and [[Sara people]], as well as some South American peoples.\n\nIn the late twentieth century, the influence of [[modern primitive|modern primitivism]] led to many of these practices being incorporated into western subcultures.  Many of these practices rely on a combination of body modification and decorative objects, thus keeping the distinction between these two types of decoration blurred.\n\nIn many cultures, jewellery is used as a temporary body modifier; in some cases, with hooks or other objects being placed into the recipient's skin.  Although this procedure is often carried out by tribal or semi-tribal groups, often acting under a trance during religious ceremonies, this practice has seeped into western culture.  Many extreme-jewellery shops now cater to people wanting large hooks or spikes set into their skin.  Most often, these hooks are used in conjunction with pulleys to hoist the recipient into the air.  This practice is said to give an erotic feeling to the person and some couples have even performed their marriage ceremony whilst being suspended by hooks.<ref name=\"ripleys\" />\n\n==Jewellery market==\nAccording to a 2007 KPMG study,<ref name = giasummer2007>{{cite journal| last = KPMG India | title= Global Jewelry Consumption | journal= Gems and Gemology | volume= XLIII |issue= Summer 2007| pages=180 | year=2007 }}</ref> the largest jewellery market is the United States with a market share of 30.8%, Japan, India, China, and the Middle East each with 8\u20139%, and Italy with 5%. The authors of the study predict a dramatic change in market shares by 2015, where the market share of the United States will have dropped to around 25%, and China and India will increase theirs to over 13%. The Middle East will remain more or less constant at 9%, whereas Europe's and Japan's marketshare will be halved and become less than 4% for Japan, and less than 3% for the biggest individual European countries, Italy and the UK.\n\n==See also==\n{{div col|colwidth=22em}}\n* [[Art jewelry]]\n* [[Estate jewelry]]\n* [[Heirloom]]\n* [[List of jewellery types]]\n* [[Live insect jewelry]]\n* [[Gemology]]\n* [[Jewellery cleaning]]\n* [[Wire sculpture]]\n* [[Jewelry Television]]\n* [[Jewellery Quarter]]\n* [[Bronze and brass ornamental work]]\n* [[List of topics characterized as pseudoscience]] (healing jewelry)\n* [[Suffrage jewellery]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* Borel, F. 1994.

According to the [[United States Census Bureau|US Census Bureau]], the population of the city is 129,775 as of July 1, 2018.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/stamfordcityconnecticut|title=census.gov|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> As of 2017, according to the Census Bureau, the population of Stamford had risen to 131,000, making it the third-largest city in the state (behind [[Bridgeport, Connecticut|Bridgeport]] and [[New Haven, Connecticut|New Haven]]) and the [[New England#Demographics|seventh-largest city in New England]]. Approximately {{convert|30|mi|km|sigfig=1|abbr=off|sp=us}} from [[Manhattan]], Stamford is in the [[Greater Bridgeport|Bridgeport-Stamford-Norwalk-Danbury Metro area]] which is a part of the Greater [[New York metropolitan area]].\n\nStamford is home to eight [[Fortune 500]] companies as of 2019,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://fortune.com/fortune500/2019/search/?hqcity=Stamford&hqstate=CT|title=Fortune500|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref><ref name=\"fortune\">{{cite web|url=https://fortune.com/fortune500/2019/search/?hqcity=Stamford|title=Fortune 500|date=29 March 2019|work=Fortune}}</ref> as well as numerous divisions of large corporations. This gives Stamford the largest [[financial centre|financial district]] in the New York metropolitan region outside New York City itself and one of the largest concentrations of corporations in the United States.\n\n==History==\n{{Main|History of Stamford, Connecticut}}\nStamford was known as Rippowam by the [[Siwanoy]] [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] inhabitants to the region, and the very first [[Europe]]an settlers to the area also referred to it as such. The present name is after the town of [[Stamford, Lincolnshire]], England.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Connecticut Magazine: An Illustrated Monthly|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qoEyAQAAMAAJ&pg=PA334|year=1903|publisher=Connecticut Magazine Company|page=334}}</ref> The [[deed]] to Stamford was signed on July 1, 1640, between Captain Turner of the [[New Haven Colony]] and Chief Ponus. By the 18th century, one of the primary industries of the town was merchandising by water, which was possible due to Stamford's proximity to New York.\n[[File:Stamford Aerial 2017.png|thumb|250x250px|Downtown and South End neighborhoods of Stamford. Long Island is in the distance.]]\n\nIn 1692, Stamford was home to a less famous [[witch trial]] than the well-known [[Salem witch trials]], which also occurred in 1692. The accusations were less fanatical and on a smaller scale, but they also grew to prominence through gossip and hysterics.<ref name=\"singular\">{{Cite book|last=Godbeer|first=Richard|title=Escaping Salem|date=January 2005|publisher=Oxford|isbn=0-19-516130-0| chapter=Chapter 1: Katherine Branch's Fits}}</ref>\n\n[[New Canaan, Connecticut|New Canaan]] officially separated from Stamford when it incorporated as a town in 1801, followed by [[Darien, Connecticut|Darien]] in 1820.\n\nStarting in the late 19th century, New York residents built summer homes on the shoreline, and even back then there were some who moved to Stamford permanently and started commuting to Manhattan by train, although the practice became more popular later. Stamford incorporated as a city in 1893.\n\nIn 1950, the [[United States Census Bureau|Census Bureau]] reported the city's population as 94.6% white and 5.2% black.<ref>{{cite web |title=Race and Hispanic Origin for Selected Cities and Other Places: Earliest Census to 1990 |publisher=U.S. Census Bureau |url=https://www.census.gov/population/www/documentation/twps0076/twps0076.html |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/69hd5KAIE?url=http://www.census.gov/population/www/documentation/twps0076/twps0076.html |archivedate=August 6, 2012 |access-date=December 7, 2017 }}</ref>\n\nIn the 1960s and 1970s, Stamford's commercial real estate boomed as corporations relocated from New York City to peripheral areas.<ref>{{cite crabgrass}}, p.268</ref> A massive urban redevelopment campaign during that time resulted in a downtown with many tall office buildings. The F.D. Rich Company was the city-designated urban renewal developer of the downtown in an ongoing redevelopment project that was contentious, beginning in the 1960s and continuing through the 1970s. The company put up what was the city's tallest structure, One Landmark Square, at 21 floors high, and the GTE building (now One Stamford Forum), along with the Marriott Hotel, the Stamford Town Center and many of the other downtown office buildings. One Landmark Square has since been dwarfed by the new 34-story [[Trump Parc Stamford]] condominium tower, and then again by the Atlantic Station development, another project by the Rich Company in partnership with Cappelli Enterprises.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1999/09/26/realestate/commercial-property-stamford-conn-pioneer-business-park-that-confounded-critics.html|title=Commercial Property /Stamford, Conn.; A Pioneer Business Park That Confounded Critics|first=Eleanor|last=Charles|date=September 26, 1999|website=Nytimes.com}}</ref> Over the years, other developers have joined in building up the downtown, a process that continued, with breaks during downturns in the economy, through the 1980s and 1990s and into the new century.\n\nSince 2008, an 80-acre mixed-use redevelopment project for the Stamford's [[Harbor Point, Stamford|Harbor Point]] neighborhood has added additional growth south of the city's [[Downtown Stamford|Downtown]] area. Once complete, the redevelopment will include 6,000,000 square feet (560,000 m<sup>2</sup>) of new residential, retail, office and hotel space, and a marina. As of July 2012, roughly 900 of the projected 4,000 Harbor Point residential units had been constructed.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ctpost.com/news/article/Trending-Why-one-city-is-booming-4540657.php|title=Trending: Why one city is booming|work=Connecticut Post|date=May 23, 2013}}</ref>\nNew restaurants and recreational activities have come up in the Harbor Point area, which is considered as New Stamford.\n\n==Geography==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2018}}\n[[File:Stamford CT night aerial from the west.jpg|thumb|right|Stamford at night from the west, with [[Norwalk, Connecticut|Norwalk]], [[Bridgeport, Connecticut|Bridgeport]], and [[New Haven, Connecticut|New Haven]] beyond. [[Long Island Sound]] is completely dark.]]\n\n  \nStamford is situated near the southwestern point of Connecticut, on [[Long Island Sound]]. It consists of several neighborhoods and villages including Cove, East Side, Downtown, North Stamford, Glenbrook, West Side, Turn Of River, Waterside, [[Springdale (Stamford)|Springdale]], Belltown, Ridgeway, Newfield, South End, Westover, Shippan, Roxbury and Palmers Hill. North of the [[Merritt Parkway]] is considered the [[North Stamford]] section of the city, encompassing its largest land mass though it is the least densely populated. North Stamford functionally and legally acts as one municipality with the City of Stamford. Stamford borders Pound Ridge, New York to the North, the Long Island Sound to the South, Greenwich, Connecticut to the West, Darien to the East, and New Canaan to the Northeast.\n\nThe city has an area of {{convert|52.09|sqmi|km2}}, making it the largest city by area in the state.<ref>{{cite web |title=Stamford Master Plan |url=https://www.stamfordct.gov/sites/stamfordct/files/u358/final_draft_12.16.14_0.pdf |website=stamfordct.gov |accessdate=4 February 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Climate===\nUnder the [[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]], Stamford has a [[temperate climate]] (''Cfa''),  with long, hot summers, and cool to cold winters, with precipitation spread fairly evenly throughout the year. Stamford, like the rest of coastal Connecticut, lies in the broad transition zone between the colder continental climates of the northern United States and southern Canada to the north, and the warmer temperate and subtropical climates of the middle and [[south Atlantic states]] to the south.\n\nThe warm/hot season in Stamford is from mid-April through early November. Late day thundershowers are common in the hottest months (June, July, August, September), despite the mostly sunny skies. The cool/cold season is from late November though mid March. Winter weather is far more variable than summer weather along the Connecticut coast, ranging from sunny days with higher temperatures to cold and blustery conditions with occasional snow. Like much of the Connecticut coast and nearby Long Island, NY, some of the winter precipitation is rain or a mix and rain and wet snow in Stamford. Stamford averages about {{convert|30|in|cm|round=5}} of snow annually, compared to inland areas like [[Hartford, Connecticut|Hartford]] and [[Albany, New York|Albany]] which average {{convert|45-60|in|cm}} of snow annually.\n\nAlthough infrequent, [[tropical cyclones]] (hurricanes/tropical storms) have struck Connecticut and the Stamford metropolitan area. Hurricane landfalls have occurred along the Connecticut coast in 1903, 1938, 1944, 1954 (Carol), 1960 (Donna), [[Hurricane Gloria]] in 1985, and [[Hurricane Sandy]] in 2012.\n\nStamford lies in [[USDA]] garden zone 7a. Stamford averages about 90 days annually with freeze. Coastal Connecticut is the broad transition zone where so-called \"subtropical indicator\" plants and other broadleaf evergreens can successfully be cultivated. As such, Southern Magnolias, Needle Palms, Windmill palm, Loblolly Pines, and Crape Myrtles are grown in private and public gardens. Like much of coastal Connecticut, Long Island, and coastal New Jersey, the growing season is rather long in Stamford\u2014averaging 210 days from April{{nbsp}}8 to November{{nbsp}}5 according to the National Weather Service in Bridgeport.\n\n{{Weather box\n|location = Stamford, Connecticut\n|single line = Y\n|Jan record high F =  69\n|Feb record high F =  74\n|Mar record high F =  85\n|Apr record

Although providing a public education is a state responsibility, Connecticut ranks near the bottom in state share of public education expenditures. Thus, the majority of education funding must come from local governments like that of Stamford. According to the State Department of Education, in the 2004\u201305 academic year, 42.7% of Stamford's public school students were economically disadvantaged, 34.8% did not have English as a home language and 11.6% were students with disabilities. Research has shown that these populations need additional resources to meet state academic standards. Owing to the state school finance system, the burden of these extra necessary costs of education falls primarily on Stamford's local government. The public school system is an integrated district with racial balance requirements exceeding those of the state of Connecticut. State standards require that a school's racial makeup be within 25% of the community's racial makeup. Stamford's standard is a more strict 10%. Over the years, schools have become unbalanced.\n\nStamford has three public [[high school]]s: [[Westhill High School (Connecticut)|Westhill High School]], [[Stamford High School (Connecticut)|Stamford High School]], and the [[Academy of Information Technology and Engineering]]. The city also has several private schools, including [[Trinity Catholic High School (Connecticut)|Trinity Catholic High School]], Villa Maria School, and Bi-Cultural Jewish Day School, [[King Low Heywood Thomas]], and The Long Ridge School as well as one state charter school: Stamford Academy Charter High School, which is closing in June 2020 which is operated by Domus <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stamfordacademy.org|title=Welcome to Stamford Academy|website=Stamfordacademy.org}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.domuskids.org/|title=Domus|website=Domuskids.org|accessdate=January 21, 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Libraries==\nStamford's [[public library]], the [[Ferguson Library]], is one of the largest in Connecticut.

According to the [[United States Census Bureau|US Census Bureau]], the population of the city is 129,775 as of July 1, 2018.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/stamfordcityconnecticut|title=census.gov|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> As of 2017, according to the Census Bureau, the population of Stamford had risen to 131,000, making it the third-largest city in the state (behind [[Bridgeport, Connecticut|Bridgeport]] and [[New Haven, Connecticut|New Haven]]) and the [[New England#Demographics|seventh-largest city in New England]]. Approximately {{convert|30|mi|km|sigfig=1|abbr=off|sp=us}} from [[Manhattan]], Stamford is in the [[Greater Bridgeport|Bridgeport-Stamford-Norwalk-Danbury Metro area]] which is a part of the Greater [[New York metropolitan area]].\n\nStamford is home to eight [[Fortune 500]] companies as of 2019,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://fortune.com/fortune500/2019/search/?hqcity=Stamford&hqstate=CT|title=Fortune500|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref><ref name=\"fortune\">{{cite web|url=https://fortune.com/fortune500/2019/search/?hqcity=Stamford|title=Fortune 500|date=29 March 2019|work=Fortune}}</ref> as well as numerous divisions of large corporations. This gives Stamford the largest [[financial centre|financial district]] in the New York metropolitan region outside New York City itself and one of the largest concentrations of corporations in the United States.\n\n==History==\n{{Main|History of Stamford, Connecticut}}\nStamford was known as Rippowam by the [[Siwanoy]] [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] inhabitants to the region, and the very first [[Europe]]an settlers to the area also referred to it as such. The present name is after the town of [[Stamford, Lincolnshire]], England.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Connecticut Magazine: An Illustrated Monthly|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qoEyAQAAMAAJ&pg=PA334|year=1903|publisher=Connecticut Magazine Company|page=334}}</ref> The [[deed]] to Stamford was signed on July 1, 1640, between Captain Turner of the [[New Haven Colony]] and Chief Ponus. By the 18th century, one of the primary industries of the town was merchandising by water, which was possible due to Stamford's proximity to New York.\n[[File:Stamford Aerial 2017.png|thumb|250x250px|Downtown and South End neighborhoods of Stamford. Long Island is in the distance.]]\n\nIn 1692, Stamford was home to a less famous [[witch trial]] than the well-known [[Salem witch trials]], which also occurred in 1692. The accusations were less fanatical and on a smaller scale, but they also grew to prominence through gossip and hysterics.<ref name=\"singular\">{{Cite book|last=Godbeer|first=Richard|title=Escaping Salem|date=January 2005|publisher=Oxford|isbn=0-19-516130-0| chapter=Chapter 1: Katherine Branch's Fits}}</ref>\n\n[[New Canaan, Connecticut|New Canaan]] officially separated from Stamford when it incorporated as a town in 1801, followed by [[Darien, Connecticut|Darien]] in 1820.\n\nStarting in the late 19th century, New York residents built summer homes on the shoreline, and even back then there were some who moved to Stamford permanently and started commuting to Manhattan by train, although the practice became more popular later. Stamford incorporated as a city in 1893.\n\nIn 1950, the [[United States Census Bureau|Census Bureau]] reported the city's population as 94.6% white and 5.2% black.<ref>{{cite web |title=Race and Hispanic Origin for Selected Cities and Other Places: Earliest Census to 1990 |publisher=U.S. Census Bureau |url=https://www.census.gov/population/www/documentation/twps0076/twps0076.html |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/69hd5KAIE?url=http://www.census.gov/population/www/documentation/twps0076/twps0076.html |archivedate=August 6, 2012 |access-date=December 7, 2017 }}</ref>\n\nIn the 1960s and 1970s, Stamford's commercial real estate boomed as corporations relocated from New York City to peripheral areas.<ref>{{cite crabgrass}}, p.268</ref> A massive urban redevelopment campaign during that time resulted in a downtown with many tall office buildings. The F.D. Rich Company was the city-designated urban renewal developer of the downtown in an ongoing redevelopment project that was contentious, beginning in the 1960s and continuing through the 1970s. The company put up what was the city's tallest structure, One Landmark Square, at 21 floors high, and the GTE building (now One Stamford Forum), along with the Marriott Hotel, the Stamford Town Center and many of the other downtown office buildings. One Landmark Square has since been dwarfed by the new 34-story [[Trump Parc Stamford]] condominium tower, and then again by the Atlantic Station development, another project by the Rich Company in partnership with Cappelli Enterprises.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1999/09/26/realestate/commercial-property-stamford-conn-pioneer-business-park-that-confounded-critics.html|title=Commercial Property /Stamford, Conn.; A Pioneer Business Park That Confounded Critics|first=Eleanor|last=Charles|date=September 26, 1999|website=Nytimes.com}}</ref> Over the years, other developers have joined in building up the downtown, a process that continued, with breaks during downturns in the economy, through the 1980s and 1990s and into the new century.\n\nSince 2008, an 80-acre mixed-use redevelopment project for the Stamford's [[Harbor Point, Stamford|Harbor Point]] neighborhood has added additional growth south of the city's [[Downtown Stamford|Downtown]] area. Once complete, the redevelopment will include 6,000,000 square feet (560,000 m<sup>2</sup>) of new residential, retail, office and hotel space, and a marina. As of July 2012, roughly 900 of the projected 4,000 Harbor Point residential units had been constructed.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ctpost.com/news/article/Trending-Why-one-city-is-booming-4540657.php|title=Trending: Why one city is booming|work=Connecticut Post|date=May 23, 2013}}</ref>\nNew restaurants and recreational activities have come up in the Harbor Point area, which is considered as New Stamford.\n\n==Geography==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2018}}\n[[File:Stamford CT night aerial from the west.jpg|thumb|right|Stamford at night from the west, with [[Norwalk, Connecticut|Norwalk]], [[Bridgeport, Connecticut|Bridgeport]], and [[New Haven, Connecticut|New Haven]] beyond. [[Long Island Sound]] is completely dark.]]\n\n  \nStamford is situated near the southwestern point of Connecticut, on [[Long Island Sound]]. It consists of several neighborhoods and villages including Cove, East Side, Downtown, North Stamford, Glenbrook, West Side, Turn Of River, Waterside, [[Springdale (Stamford)|Springdale]], Belltown, Ridgeway, Newfield, South End, Westover, Shippan, Roxbury and Palmers Hill. North of the [[Merritt Parkway]] is considered the [[North Stamford]] section of the city, encompassing its largest land mass though it is the least densely populated. North Stamford functionally and legally acts as one municipality with the City of Stamford. Stamford borders Pound Ridge, New York to the North, the Long Island Sound to the South, Greenwich, Connecticut to the West, Darien to the East, and New Canaan to the Northeast.\n\nThe city has an area of {{convert|52.09|sqmi|km2}}, making it the largest city by area in the state.<ref>{{cite web |title=Stamford Master Plan |url=https://www.stamfordct.gov/sites/stamfordct/files/u358/final_draft_12.16.14_0.pdf |website=stamfordct.gov |accessdate=4 February 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Climate===\nUnder the [[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]], Stamford has a [[temperate climate]] (''Cfa''),  with long, hot summers, and cool to cold winters, with precipitation spread fairly evenly throughout the year. Stamford, like the rest of coastal Connecticut, lies in the broad transition zone between the colder continental climates of the northern United States and southern Canada to the north, and the warmer temperate and subtropical climates of the middle and [[south Atlantic states]] to the south.\n\nThe warm/hot season in Stamford is from mid-April through early November. Late day thundershowers are common in the hottest months (June, July, August, September), despite the mostly sunny skies. The cool/cold season is from late November though mid March. Winter weather is far more variable than summer weather along the Connecticut coast, ranging from sunny days with higher temperatures to cold and blustery conditions with occasional snow. Like much of the Connecticut coast and nearby Long Island, NY, some of the winter precipitation is rain or a mix and rain and wet snow in Stamford. Stamford averages about {{convert|30|in|cm|round=5}} of snow annually, compared to inland areas like [[Hartford, Connecticut|Hartford]] and [[Albany, New York|Albany]] which average {{convert|45-60|in|cm}} of snow annually.\n\nAlthough infrequent, [[tropical cyclones]] (hurricanes/tropical storms) have struck Connecticut and the Stamford metropolitan area. Hurricane landfalls have occurred along the Connecticut coast in 1903, 1938, 1944, 1954 (Carol), 1960 (Donna), [[Hurricane Gloria]] in 1985, and [[Hurricane Sandy]] in 2012.\n\nStamford lies in [[USDA]] garden zone 7a. Stamford averages about 90 days annually with freeze. Coastal Connecticut is the broad transition zone where so-called \"subtropical indicator\" plants and other broadleaf evergreens can successfully be cultivated. As such, Southern Magnolias, Needle Palms, Windmill palm, Loblolly Pines, and Crape Myrtles are grown in private and public gardens. Like much of coastal Connecticut, Long Island, and coastal New Jersey, the growing season is rather long in Stamford\u2014averaging 210 days from April{{nbsp}}8 to November{{nbsp}}5 according to the National Weather Service in Bridgeport.\n\n{{Weather box\n|location = Stamford, Connecticut\n|single line = Y\n|Jan record high F =  69\n|Feb record high F =  74\n|Mar record high F =  85\n|Apr record

Although providing a public education is a state responsibility, Connecticut ranks near the bottom in state share of public education expenditures. Thus, the majority of education funding must come from local governments like that of Stamford. According to the State Department of Education, in the 2004\u201305 academic year, 42.7% of Stamford's public school students were economically disadvantaged, 34.8% did not have English as a home language and 11.6% were students with disabilities. Research has shown that these populations need additional resources to meet state academic standards. Owing to the state school finance system, the burden of these extra necessary costs of education falls primarily on Stamford's local government. The public school system is an integrated district with racial balance requirements exceeding those of the state of Connecticut. State standards require that a school's racial makeup be within 25% of the community's racial makeup. Stamford's standard is a more strict 10%. Over the years, schools have become unbalanced.\n\nStamford has three public [[high school]]s: [[Westhill High School (Connecticut)|Westhill High School]], [[Stamford High School (Connecticut)|Stamford High School]], and the [[Academy of Information Technology and Engineering]]. The city also has several private schools, including [[Trinity Catholic High School (Connecticut)|Trinity Catholic High School]], Villa Maria School, and Bi-Cultural Jewish Day School, [[King Low Heywood Thomas]], and The Long Ridge School as well as one state charter school: Stamford Academy Charter High School, which is closing in June 2020 which is operated by Domus <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stamfordacademy.org|title=Welcome to Stamford Academy|website=Stamfordacademy.org}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.domuskids.org/|title=Domus|website=Domuskids.org|accessdate=January 21, 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Libraries==\nStamford's [[public library]], the [[Ferguson Library]], is one of the largest in Connecticut.
