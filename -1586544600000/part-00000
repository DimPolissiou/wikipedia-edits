Marosi)]] in 2005. The original release of the game was in Hungary in October 2006. The English subtitled version was first released by digital download in April 2009 by Lezard Interactive. The game became available for iPhone and iPad in 2015.\n\nAn important objective of the game is to introduce the baroque Hungarian town of Eger through a first-person experience provided by nearly 800 panoramic photographs and film footage fit for an entire movie.<ref>http://gamedev.privatemoon.com/en/fomenu1/jumurdzsak-gyuruje-pc-eredeti</ref>\n\nThe game has a sequel titled MIAZMA or the Devil's Stone (''MIAZMA avagy az \u00f6rd\u00f6g k\u00f6ve'', released on DVD in Hungarian in 2015).<ref>http://miazma.privatemoon.com/</ref>\n\n== Gameplay ==\n\nYoomurjak's Ring is a [[point-and-click]] adventure game with a simple interface. It is a mixture of third-person movie scenes and first-person navigation and interaction. The player can pan around in each node in 360 degrees, in any direction.\n\nThe game inherited its engine from Private Moon's [[AGON]] series, with some enhancements. It features an Inventory for collecting items that will be used later. All dialog is logged in a separate notebook for reference. This is useful as dialog is not repeated.\n\nAs an adventure game, the player's first challenge is to figure out what to do next. Most of the clues are given in the dialog and narrations, some in documents.\n\nThe voice is the original Hungarian. The localized version is subtitled English.\n\n== The plot ==\n\nJonathan Hunt is a young American journalist.  He decides to visit his mother's birthplace in [[Hungary]] and the picturesque town of [[Eger]] because he has read about it in an old Hungarian novel. But he also has another reason to go there.\n\nThis book was one of his favorite childhood readings,  titled \u2018[[Eclipse of the Crescent Moon]]\u2019,<ref>http://www.magyarulbabelben.net/index.php?page=work&interfaceLang=en&literatureLang=hu&translationLang=all&auth_id=589&work_id=2347&tran_id=3464&tr_id=0&tran_lang=en</ref> written by a Hungarian author [[G\u00e9za G\u00e1rdonyi]] who also lived in Eger. This is a real novel about the heroic past of Eger in the middle of the 16th century when the town was one of the ultimate strongholds against the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] forces advancing.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.egrivar.hu/en |title=Archived copy |accessdate=April 4, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110828040856/http://egrivar.hu/en/ |archivedate=August 28, 2011 }}</ref> When Jonathan received that book from his great-grandfather he found  two letters in it from a strange Hungarian scientist named \u00c1bray, dated back in 1898. This man claimed to have discoveries about no less than travelling in time.\n\nUpon arriving in Eger, Jonathan wants to find the descendants of this scientist.  Juli, the assistant of the tourist office gives him a number of hints and an old man also seems to have some promising information. Jonathan learns about a family legend and the most peculiar disappearance of an apprentice who once worked for the scientist himself.\n\nThe legend is about the same old book.  The old man believes that the author modeled Yoomurjak, the Turkish character in the book, on his grandfather, who was actually the disappeared apprentice. The gentleman claims that in that period \u00c1bray was working on devising a time machine and due to a doomed journey in time his aide remained in the 16th century. Jonathan, a realistic man, almost laughs at the theory, but the sudden death of the old man awakens his curiosity.  In a note left behind the old man entrusts Jonathan with accomplishing his unfinished research.\n\nThe game covers the events of five days:\n\n* Day 1 (Eger, the town of legends)\n* Day 2 (Proofs of the first time traveler)\n* Day 3 (Yoomurjak's messages)\n* Day 4 (On the track of the ring)\n* Day 5 (The power of the ring)\n\n== Characters ==\n\n'''Jonathan Hunt:'''\nAs to his identity in the game, he is the great-grandson of Professor Samuel Hunt, the protagonist of Private Moon's adventure game series AGON. His mother was born in Hungary and taught Jonathan the culture and the language of her home country. After breaking up with his girlfriend Allison, Jonathan aims to start an entirely new life in the peaceful town of Eger. But it turns out differently.\n\n'''Yoomurjak:'''\nYoomurjak (originally Jumurdzs\u00e1k) is a (negative) hero of the novel, a fictitious character. In the novel, he was a soldier of the Ottoman army. Yoomurjak had an amulet: a ring that he wore to protect him from danger. Once, when he was captured he decided to buy his freedom against this ring. Later he tried to get it back but to no avail. The game uses the motive of this very ring, assuming it was found and used for purposes the player has to unfold in the game.\n\n== Features ==\n\n'''Over 30 locations:'''\nThe fort, a number of museums, the town hall, the historic library, the Lyceum, the observatory, a wine cellar, an antique shop, the [[Eger minaret]] from the Turkish period, the immense basilica and many other locations are to be explored.\n\n'''Professional actors:'''\nAll these roles are played by professional Hungarian actors. The main characters are played by prominent Hungarian celebrities: [[L\u00e1szl\u00f3 G\u00f6r\u00f6g (actor)|L\u00e1szl\u00f3 G\u00f6r\u00f6g]],<ref>https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0331222/</ref> [[Gy\u00f6rgy B\u00e1rdy]] and in the gangster's role a popular rapper [[Ganxsta Zolee]].\n\n'''Panoramic views:'''\nThe first-person view control and the large number of panoramic pictures provide a real-life feeling of walking around the streets of Eger and in the interiors. Most of the panoramic pictures are not static; the loop movements of the characters and extras make the exploration of the locations even more realistic.\n\n'''More than 1.5 hours of footage:'''\nThe film footage is presented to the gamers in many small fragments. The movie scenes and dialogue, starting from half a minute to nearly 10 minutes long, blend in seamlessly into the realistic environment created by panoramic pictures.\n\n'''Special sound recordings:'''\nThe atmospheric background noises were recorded in the original locations, just like most of the dialogue. Besides the mostly electronically scored mood-enhancing tracks, music also has a special role in the riddles of the game.\n\n== Locations ==\n\nA few of the historic locations in the game:\n\n'''[[Eger]]:'''\nEger is a city in northern Hungary, with a population of about 56,000. The town is a major touristic destination of the country. It is best known for its castle, thermal baths, historic buildings (including the northernmost Turkish minaret), and its red and white wines.\n\n'''Senator H\u00e1z:'''<ref>http://www.senatorhaz.hu/en.html</ref>\nThe small hotel Jonathan uses (room No. 15) is one of Eger's oldest baroque buildings. It was built from the actual stones of the castle's outside walls some 300 years ago. One of its owners was a Senator, hence the name Senator H\u00e1z (the house of the senator).\n\n'''[[Lyceum]]:'''<ref>http://hungarystartshere.com/Lyceum-Karoly-Eszterhazy-College-foiskola-Eger</ref>\nThe Lyceum was built for the purpose of a university. Today, a college operates in the building and it also houses several significant collections. The especially beautiful Archdiocesan Library was opened in 1793 with 20,000 volumes \u2013 currently, it houses nearly 150,000 volumes. The observatory and the Camera Obscura (a large periscope) was installed in 1776, equipped with the most modern apparatuses of the time, based on the design of astronomer Maximilian (Miksa) Hell.\n\n'''[[Minaret]]:'''\nEger was part of the Ottoman Empire for 91 years (1596\u20131687). During this time, numerous Turkish buildings were erected in the city, among them a mosque with this minaret. The mosque has not survived the centuries but the minaret, the northernmost one in Europe, is still in perfect condition. Jonathan has to climb 97 steps to reach the balcony.\n\n'''The G\u00e1rdonyi House:'''\n[[G\u00e9za G\u00e1rdonyi]] is one of the best known writers in Hungary. Between 1897 and 1922, he lived in this house, and here wrote many of his works, including one of his\nmost beautiful historical novels, Stars of Eger. G\u00e1rdonyi owned nearly ten-thousand books. Every piece of his furniture has remained in its original place, as shown in the game. He often took notes in cryptography which are displayed in the glass cabinets.\n\n'''The Castle of Eger:'''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.egrivar.hu/en |title=Archived copy |accessdate=April 4, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110828040856/http://egrivar.hu/en/ |archivedate=August 28, 2011 }}</ref>\nThis large medieval fortress ranks among the most visited attractions in the country. The castle's defenders are said to have numbered fewer than 2,000, including women and children when they successfully held off a Turkish army of 80,000 soldiers in 1552 (the [[Siege of Eger (1552)|Siege of Eger]]). Since then, the castle has been a symbol of patriotic integrity and resistance.\n\n'''The Turkish Bath:''' <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.egertermal.hu/en/torokfurdo.php |title=Archived copy |accessdate=April 4, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110119083046/http://www.egertermal.hu/en/torokfurdo.php |archivedate=January 19, 2011 }}</ref>\nThe predecessor of the Turkish Bath,  professor Cifra's favorite place, was built in the early 17th century when the town was under Turkish rule. The bath was to serve the purpose of ritual bathing but the water's beneficial effects on health soon became evident. The curative effect of the water is attributed to its radon content.\n\n== The background ==\n\nPrivate Moon Studios was given the opportunity to create Yoomurjak's Ring by winning a competition. The municipality of Eger was looking for alternative ideas for promoting their town in an unconventional way, making also use of G\u00e1rdonyi's popular novel (The Eclipse of the Crescent Moon) as both the author and the book are strongly related to the town.\n\n== The creators ==\n\nGame designer/producer: [[Pierrot (Tam\u00e1s Z.

[[bell hooks]] makes much the same points regarding the circumstances under which African Americans encounter and represent whiteness. Other black thinkers have carried this insight still further. They contend that whiteness is also experienced through terror by whites, who find and reproduce unity by committing and more often by witnessing acts of violence. Slave tales and autobiographies, for example, at times insisted upon the centrality of stealing humans, breaking up families, 'patrolling' plantations, and committing rape to the growth of a white identity.\"</ref>\n\nWhite academics in the United States and the United Kingdom (UK) began to study whiteness as early as 1983, creating the idea of a discipline called \"whiteness studies\".<ref>{{cite book | last = Murray | first = Albert | title = Omni-Americans: Some Alternatives to the Folklore of White Supremacy | publisher = Vintage | year = 1983 | oclc = 1020212158}}</ref> The \"[[canon wars]]\" of the late 1980s and 1990s, a political controversy over the centrality of white authors and perspectives in United States culture, led the scholar [[Shelley Fisher Fishkin]] to ask \"how the imaginative construction of 'whiteness' had shaped American literature and American history\".<ref name=\"Fishkin_interrogate\">{{cite journal | last = Fishkin | first = Shelley Fisher | author-link = Shelley Fisher Fishkin | title = Interrogating \"Whiteness,\" Complicating \"Blackness\": Remapping American Culture | journal = [[American Quarterly]] | volume = 47 | issue = 3 | pages = 428&ndash;466 | publisher = [[Johns Hopkins University Press]] | doi = 10.2307/2713296 | date = September 1995 | quote = In this essay I will provide a brief overview of over a hundred books and articles from fields including literary criticism, history, cultural studies, anthropology, popular culture, communication studies, music history, art history, dance history, humor studies, philosophy, linguistics, and folklore, all published between 1990 and 1995 or forthcoming shortly.

Teaching and research around whiteness often overlap with research on [[post-colonial theory]] and [[orientalism]] taking place in the Arts and Humanities, Sociology, Literature, Communications, and Cultural and Media Studies faculties and departments, among others (e.g. Kent, Leeds). Also heavily engaged in whiteness studies are practitioners of [[anti-racism|anti-racist education]], such as [[Betita Martinez]] and the Challenging White Supremacy workshop.\n\nOne contribution to White Studies is [[Rich Benjamin]]'s ''[[Searching for Whitopia|Searching for Whitopia: An Improbable Journey to the Heart of White America]]''. The book examines white social beliefs and white anxiety in the contemporary United States\u2014in the context of enormous demographic, cultural, and social change.  The book is often taught as a primer in White Studies on white racial identity in a \"post-racial\" US.<ref>{{cite book | last = Benjamin | first = Rich | title = Searching for Whitopia: An Improbable Journey to the Heart of White America | publisher = Hyperion | location = New York | year = 2009 | isbn = 9781401322687 }}</ref>\n\nAnother major contribution to whiteness studies is the analysis of whiteness as a phenomenon, not just localized to the US and Western Hemisphere, but also in the context of other post-colonial metropoles such as the Netherlands.  [[Gloria Wekker]]\u2019s ''White Innocence: Paradoxes of Colonialism and Race'' excavates the immutability and fluidity of white identity and its relationship to innocence in the context of post-colonial [[Netherlands]] in the first decade of the twenty-first century. Wekker identifies white innocence as a contemporary construction and denial [aggressive national forgetting] of the Netherlands role and proximity to European imperialism, racial stratification and hierarchy, and its contributions to the making of contemporary constructions of national belonging and cultural normativity (autochtoon vs. allochtonen).\n\nIn Wekker\u2019s analysis, although a majority of the residents of the Netherlands are migrants, the process of stratifying Dutch from \u201cOther\u201d is facilitated through skin tone and non-Christian religious practices (\u201cdeviant\u201d, non-White religions). In Wekker's account, the process of racialization is reserved for mid-to-late twentieth century migrant groups [i.e. Muslims, Black Surinamese, Black Antilleans], interchangeably as a means of delineating groups outside the constructed immutable \u201cnorms\u201d of Dutch society. Ultimately, Wekker is illuminating the cultural and rhetorical maneuvering that occurs within Dutch popular culture, educational spaces, and national discourses that facilitate a normalizing, non-identity to whiteness and how this very concept is intricately connected to a longer historical nineteenth-century racial grammar that accompanied imperial expansion.<ref>{{cite book | last = Wekker | first = Gloria | title = White Innocence: Paradoxes of Colonialism and Race | publisher = Duke University Press | location = Durham | year = 2016 | isbn = 9780822360759 }}</ref>\n\n==Areas of study==\n===Whiteness===\nWhiteness studies draws on research into the definition of race, originating with the United States but applying to racial stratification worldwide. This research emphasizes the historically recent [[social construction]] of white identity. As stated by [[W. E. B. Du Bois]] in 1920: \"The discovery of a personal whiteness among the world's peoples is a very modern thing,\u2014a nineteenth and twentieth century matter, indeed.\"<ref>W. E. B.

Scholars such as [[Winthrop Jordan]]<ref>{{cite book | last = Jordan | first = Winthrop D. | author-link = Winthrop Jordan | title = White over Black: American Attitudes Toward the Negro, 1550-1812 | publisher = Omohundro Institute of Early Armerian History and Culture, Wiliamsburg, Virginia | location = Chapel Hill | year = 2012 | edition = 2nd | isbn = 9781469600765 }}</ref> have traced the evolution of the legally defined line between \"blacks\" and \"whites\" to colonial government efforts to prevent cross-racial revolts among unpaid laborers.\n\nPrinceton professor [[Nell Irvin Painter]], in her 2010 book ''[[The History of White People]],''<ref>{{cite book | last = Painter | first = Nell Irvin | title = The History of White People | publisher = [[W.

The American definition of whiteness evolved over time; initially groups such as Jews and southern Europeans were not regarded as white, but as skin color became the primary criterion, they were gradually accepted. Painter argues that in the 21st century the definition of whiteness - or more precisely the definition of \"nonblackness\" - has continued to expand, so that now \"The dark of skin who happen to be rich ... and the light of skin from any (racial background) who are beautiful, are now well on their way to inclusion.\"(pp.&nbsp;389&ndash;90.)\n\nAcademic Joseph Pugliese is among writers who have applied whiteness studies to an [[Australia]]n context, discussing the ways that [[Indigenous Australians]] were marginalized in the wake of British colonization of Australia, as whiteness came to be defined as central to Australian identity, diminishing [[Aboriginal identity]] in the process.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Perera | first1 = Suvendrini | last2 = Pugliese | first2 = Joseph | title = White Law of the Biopolitical | journal = Journal of the European Association of Studies on Australia | volume = 3 | issue = 1 | pages = 87&ndash;100 | publisher = European Association of Studies on Australia | date = 2012 | url = http://www.easa-australianstudies.net/node/295 | ref = harv }} [http://www.easa-australianstudies.net/files/jeasa4spererajpugliese16.pdf Pdf.]</ref><ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Perera | first1 = Suvendrini | last2 = Pugliese | first2 = Joseph | title = Death in a dry river: black life, white property, parched justice | journal = Somatechnics | volume = 1 | issue = 1 | pages = 65&ndash;86 | publisher = [[Edinburgh University Press]] | doi = 10.3366/soma.2011.0007 | date = 2011 | ref = harv }}</ref> Pugliese discusses the 20th-century [[White Australia policy]] as a conscious attempt to preserve the \"purity\" of whiteness in Australian society.<ref>{{cite journal | last = Pugliese | first = Joseph | title = Race as Category Crisis: Whiteness and the Topical Assignation of Race | journal = Social Semiotics | volume = 12 | issue = 2 | pages = 149&ndash;168 | publisher = [[Taylor & Francis]] | doi = 10.1080/103503302760212078 | date = 2002 | ref = harv }}</ref><ref>{{cite book | last = Willard | first = Myra | title = History of the White Australia policy to 1920  |url=https://archive.org/details/historyofwhiteau0000will | url-access = registration | publisher = Frank Cass and Company | location = Carlton, Victoria  |origyear=1923 | year = 1967 | isbn = 9780714610368 }}</ref> Likewise Stefanie Affeldt considers whiteness \"a concept not yet fully developed at the time the first convicts and settlers arrived down under\" <ref>Affeldt, Stefanie.

You can try to mitigate your evilness, but you can't eradicate it. The goal of WS is to entrench permanent race consciousness in everyone&nbsp;\u2014 eternal victimhood for nonwhites, eternal guilt for whites&nbsp;\u2014 and was most famously framed by WS chief guru, [[Noel Ignatiev]], former professor at [[Harvard University]] [''sic'', Ignatiev was a Ph.D. student and then a tutor at Harvard, but never a professor], now teaching at the [[Massachusetts College of Art]]: \"The key to solving the social problems of our age is to abolish the white race&nbsp;\u2014 in other words, to abolish the privileges of the white skin.\"<ref name=Kay1/>\n</blockquote>\n\nIn addition to such criticism in the mass media, whiteness studies has earned a mixed reception from academics in other fields. In 2001, historian [[Eric Arnesen]] wrote that \"whiteness has become a blank screen onto which those who claim to analyze it can project their own meanings\" and that the field \"suffers from a number of potentially fatal methodological and conceptual flaws.\"<ref name=\"arnesen\">{{cite journal | last = Arnesen | first = Eric | title = Whiteness and the Historian's Imagination | journal = International Labor and Working-Class History | volume = 60 | issue = 60 | pages = 3&ndash;32 | publisher = [[Cambridge University Press]] | jstor = 27672732 | date = October 2001 | ref = harv | doi = 10.1017/S0147547901004380 }}</ref>  First, Arnesen writes that the core theses of whiteness studies\u2014that racial categories are arbitrary social constructs without definite biological basis, and that some white Americans benefit from racist discrimination of non-whites\u2014have been common wisdom in academia for many decades and are hardly as novel or controversial as whiteness studies scholars seem to believe. Additionally, Arnesen accuses whiteness studies scholars of sloppy thinking; of making claims not supported by their sources; of overstating supporting evidence and [[cherry picking]] to neglect contrary information.\n\nHe notes that a particular datum almost entirely ignored by whiteness studies scholars is religion, which has played a prominent role in conflicts among various American classes. He says that a type of \"keyword literalism\" persists in whiteness studies, where important words and phrases from primary sources are taken out of their historical context. Whiteness has so many different definitions that the word is \"nothing less than a moving target.\"<ref name=\"arnesen\"/> Arnesen notes that whiteness studies scholars are entirely on the [[Far-left politics|far left]] of the [[political spectrum]], and suggests that their apparent vitriol towards white Americans is due in part to white workers not fulfilling the predictions of [[Marxist theory]] that the [[proletariat]] would overcome racial, national and class distinctions to unite and overthrow [[capitalism]]. He cites, as an example, [[David Roediger]]\u2019s afterword to the seminal ''Wages of Whiteness'', which asserts that the book was written as a reaction to \"the appalling extent to which white male workers voted for [[Reaganism]] in the 1980s.\"<ref name=\"arnesen\"/> Arnesen argues that in the absence of supporting evidence, whiteness studies often rely on amateurish [[Freudian]] speculation about the motives of white people: \"The [[psychoanalysis]] of whiteness here differs from the 'talking cure' of Freudianism partly in its neglect of the speech of those under study.\" Without more accurate scholarship, Arnesen writes that \"it is time to retire whiteness for more precise historical categories and analytical tools.\"<ref name=\"arnesen\"/>\n\nIn 2002 historian [[Peter Kolchin]] offered a more positive assessment and declared that, at its best, whiteness studies has \"unfulfilled potential\" and offers a novel and valuable means of studying history.<ref name=\"kolchin\">{{cite journal | last = Kolchin | first = Peter | author-link = Peter Kolchin | title = Whiteness Studies: The New History of Race in America | journal = [[Journal of American History]] | volume = 89 | issue = 1 | pages = 154&ndash;173 | publisher = [[Oxford University Press]] | jstor = 270078 | doi = 10.2307/2700788 | date = June 2002 | ref = harv }} [https://www.cwu.edu/diversity/sites/cts.cwu.edu.diversity/files/documents/whiteness.pdf Pdf.]</ref>  Particularly, he praises scholarship into the development of the ''concept'' of whiteness in the United States, and notes that the definition and implications of a white racial identity have shifted over the decades. Yet Kolchin describes a \"persistent sense of unease \" with certain aspects of whiteness studies. There is no consensus definition of whiteness, and thus the word is used in vague and contradictory ways, with some scholars even leaving the term undefined in their articles or essays.\"<ref name=\"kolchin\"/> Kolchin also objects to \"a persistent dualism evident in the work of the best whiteness studies authors,\" who often claim that whiteness is a social construct while also arguing, paradoxically, that whiteness is an \"omnipresent and unchanging\" reality existing independent of socialization.<ref name=\"kolchin\"/> Kolchin agrees that entering a post-racial paradigm might be beneficial for humanity, but he challenges the didactic tone of whiteness studies scholars who single out a white racial identification as negative, while praising a black or Asian self-identification. Scholars in whiteness studies sometimes seriously undermine their arguments by interpreting historical evidence independent of its broader context (e.g., Karen Brodkin's examination of American anti-semitism largely neglects its roots in European anti-semitism). Finally, Kolchin categorically rejects the argument\u2014common amongst many whiteness scholars\u2014that racism and whiteness are intrinsically and uniquely American, and he expresses concern at the \"belief in the moral emptiness of whiteness [...] there is a thin line between saying that whiteness is evil and saying that whites are evil.\"<ref name=\"kolchin\"/>\n\n[[Theodore W. Allen]], pioneering writer on \"white skin privilege\" and \"white privilege\" from the 1960s until his death in 2005, offered a critical review \"On Roediger\u2019s Wages of Whiteness\" (Revised Edition).<ref name=\"Wages\" /> He personally put \"whiteness\" in quotes because he shied away from using the term. As Allen explained, \n<blockquote>\"it\u2019s an abstract noun, it\u2019s an abstraction, it\u2019s an attribute of some people, it\u2019s not the role they play.

The book is often taught as a primer in White Studies on white racial identity in a \"post-racial\" US.<ref>{{cite book | last = Benjamin | first = Rich | title = Searching for Whitopia: An Improbable Journey to the Heart of White America | publisher = Hyperion | location = New York | year = 2009 | isbn = 9781401322687 }}</ref>\n\nAnother major contribution to whiteness studies is the analysis of whiteness as a phenomenon, not just localized to the US and Western Hemisphere, but also in the context of other post-colonial metropoles such as the Netherlands.  [[Gloria Wekker]]\u2019s ''White Innocence: Paradoxes of Colonialism and Race'' excavates the immutability and fluidity of white identity and its relationship to innocence in the context of post-colonial [[Netherlands]] in the first decade of the twenty-first century. Wekker identifies white innocence as a contemporary construction and denial [aggressive national forgetting] of the Netherlands role and proximity to European imperialism, racial stratification and hierarchy, and its contributions to the making of contemporary constructions of national belonging and cultural normativity (autochtoon vs. allochtonen).\n\nIn Wekker\u2019s analysis, although a majority of the residents of the Netherlands are migrants, the process of stratifying Dutch from \u201cOther\u201d is facilitated through skin tone and non-Christian religious practices (\u201cdeviant\u201d, non-White religions). In Wekker's account, the process of racialization is reserved for mid-to-late twentieth century migrant groups [i.e. Muslims, Black Surinamese, Black Antilleans], interchangeably as a means of delineating groups outside the constructed immutable \u201cnorms\u201d of Dutch society. Ultimately, Wekker is illuminating the cultural and rhetorical maneuvering that occurs within Dutch popular culture, educational spaces, and national discourses that facilitate a normalizing, non-identity to whiteness and how this very concept is intricately connected to a longer historical nineteenth-century racial grammar that accompanied imperial expansion.<ref>{{cite book | last = Wekker | first = Gloria | title = White Innocence: Paradoxes of Colonialism and Race | publisher = Duke University Press | location = Durham | year = 2016 | isbn = 9780822360759 }}</ref>\n\n==Areas of study==\n===Whiteness===\nWhiteness studies draws on research into the definition of race, originating with the United States but applying to racial stratification worldwide. This research emphasizes the historically recent [[social construction]] of white identity. As stated by [[W. E. B. Du Bois]] in 1920: \"The discovery of a personal whiteness among the world's peoples is a very modern thing,\u2014a nineteenth and twentieth century matter, indeed.\"<ref>W. E. B.

Scholars such as [[Winthrop Jordan]]<ref>{{cite book | last = Jordan | first = Winthrop D. | author-link = Winthrop Jordan | title = White over Black: American Attitudes Toward the Negro, 1550-1812 | publisher = Omohundro Institute of Early Armerian History and Culture, Wiliamsburg, Virginia | location = Chapel Hill | year = 2012 | edition = 2nd | isbn = 9781469600765 }}</ref> have traced the evolution of the legally defined line between \"blacks\" and \"whites\" to colonial government efforts to prevent cross-racial revolts among unpaid laborers.\n\nPrinceton professor [[Nell Irvin Painter]], in her 2010 book ''[[The History of White People]],''<ref>{{cite book | last = Painter | first = Nell Irvin | title = The History of White People | publisher = [[W.

The American definition of whiteness evolved over time; initially groups such as Jews and southern Europeans were not regarded as white, but as skin color became the primary criterion, they were gradually accepted. Painter argues that in the 21st century the definition of whiteness - or more precisely the definition of \"nonblackness\" - has continued to expand, so that now \"The dark of skin who happen to be rich ... and the light of skin from any (racial background) who are beautiful, are now well on their way to inclusion.\"(pp.&nbsp;389&ndash;90.)\n\nAcademic Joseph Pugliese is among writers who have applied whiteness studies to an [[Australia]]n context, discussing the ways that [[Indigenous Australians]] were marginalized in the wake of British colonization of Australia, as whiteness came to be defined as central to Australian identity, diminishing [[Aboriginal identity]] in the process.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Perera | first1 = Suvendrini | last2 = Pugliese | first2 = Joseph | title = White Law of the Biopolitical | journal = Journal of the European Association of Studies on Australia | volume = 3 | issue = 1 | pages = 87&ndash;100 | publisher = European Association of Studies on Australia | date = 2012 | url = http://www.easa-australianstudies.net/node/295 | ref = harv }} [http://www.easa-australianstudies.net/files/jeasa4spererajpugliese16.pdf Pdf.]</ref><ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Perera | first1 = Suvendrini | last2 = Pugliese | first2 = Joseph | title = Death in a dry river: black life, white property, parched justice | journal = Somatechnics | volume = 1 | issue = 1 | pages = 65&ndash;86 | publisher = [[Edinburgh University Press]] | doi = 10.3366/soma.2011.0007 | date = 2011 | ref = harv }}</ref> Pugliese discusses the 20th-century [[White Australia policy]] as a conscious attempt to preserve the \"purity\" of whiteness in Australian society.<ref>{{cite journal | last = Pugliese | first = Joseph | title = Race as Category Crisis: Whiteness and the Topical Assignation of Race | journal = Social Semiotics | volume = 12 | issue = 2 | pages = 149&ndash;168 | publisher = [[Taylor & Francis]] | doi = 10.1080/103503302760212078 | date = 2002 | ref = harv }}</ref><ref>{{cite book | last = Willard | first = Myra | title = History of the White Australia policy to 1920  |url=https://archive.org/details/historyofwhiteau0000will | url-access = registration | publisher = Frank Cass and Company | location = Carlton, Victoria  |origyear=1923 | year = 1967 | isbn = 9780714610368 }}</ref> Likewise Stefanie Affeldt considers whiteness \"a concept not yet fully developed at the time the first convicts and settlers arrived down under\" <ref>Affeldt, Stefanie.

You can try to mitigate your evilness, but you can't eradicate it. The goal of WS is to entrench permanent race consciousness in everyone&nbsp;\u2014 eternal victimhood for nonwhites, eternal guilt for whites&nbsp;\u2014 and was most famously framed by WS chief guru, [[Noel Ignatiev]], former professor at [[Harvard University]] [''sic'', Ignatiev was a Ph.D. student and then a tutor at Harvard, but never a professor], now teaching at the [[Massachusetts College of Art]]: \"The key to solving the social problems of our age is to abolish the white race&nbsp;\u2014 in other words, to abolish the privileges of the white skin.\"<ref name=Kay1/>\n</blockquote>\n\nIn addition to such criticism in the mass media, whiteness studies has earned a mixed reception from academics in other fields. In 2001, historian [[Eric Arnesen]] wrote that \"whiteness has become a blank screen onto which those who claim to analyze it can project their own meanings\" and that the field \"suffers from a number of potentially fatal methodological and conceptual flaws.\"<ref name=\"arnesen\">{{cite journal | last = Arnesen | first = Eric | title = Whiteness and the Historian's Imagination | journal = International Labor and Working-Class History | volume = 60 | issue = 60 | pages = 3&ndash;32 | publisher = [[Cambridge University Press]] | jstor = 27672732 | date = October 2001 | ref = harv | doi = 10.1017/S0147547901004380 }}</ref>  First, Arnesen writes that the core theses of whiteness studies\u2014that racial categories are arbitrary social constructs without definite biological basis, and that some white Americans benefit from racist discrimination of non-whites\u2014have been common wisdom in academia for many decades and are hardly as novel or controversial as whiteness studies scholars seem to believe. Additionally, Arnesen accuses whiteness studies scholars of sloppy thinking; of making claims not supported by their sources; of overstating supporting evidence and [[cherry picking]] to neglect contrary information.\n\nHe notes that a particular datum almost entirely ignored by whiteness studies scholars is religion, which has played a prominent role in conflicts among various American classes. He says that a type of \"keyword literalism\" persists in whiteness studies, where important words and phrases from primary sources are taken out of their historical context. Whiteness has so many different definitions that the word is \"nothing less than a moving target.\"<ref name=\"arnesen\"/> Arnesen notes that whiteness studies scholars are entirely on the [[Far-left politics|far left]] of the [[political spectrum]], and suggests that their apparent vitriol towards white Americans is due in part to white workers not fulfilling the predictions of [[Marxist theory]] that the [[proletariat]] would overcome racial, national and class distinctions to unite and overthrow [[capitalism]]. He cites, as an example, [[David Roediger]]\u2019s afterword to the seminal ''Wages of Whiteness'', which asserts that the book was written as a reaction to \"the appalling extent to which white male workers voted for [[Reaganism]] in the 1980s.\"<ref name=\"arnesen\"/> Arnesen argues that in the absence of supporting evidence, whiteness studies often rely on amateurish [[Freudian]] speculation about the motives of white people: \"The [[psychoanalysis]] of whiteness here differs from the 'talking cure' of Freudianism partly in its neglect of the speech of those under study.\" Without more accurate scholarship, Arnesen writes that \"it is time to retire whiteness for more precise historical categories and analytical tools.\"<ref name=\"arnesen\"/>\n\nIn 2002 historian [[Peter Kolchin]] offered a more positive assessment and declared that, at its best, whiteness studies has \"unfulfilled potential\" and offers a novel and valuable means of studying history.<ref name=\"kolchin\">{{cite journal | last = Kolchin | first = Peter | author-link = Peter Kolchin | title = Whiteness Studies: The New History of Race in America | journal = [[Journal of American History]] | volume = 89 | issue = 1 | pages = 154&ndash;173 | publisher = [[Oxford University Press]] | jstor = 270078 | doi = 10.2307/2700788 | date = June 2002 | ref = harv }} [https://www.cwu.edu/diversity/sites/cts.cwu.edu.diversity/files/documents/whiteness.pdf Pdf.]</ref>  Particularly, he praises scholarship into the development of the ''concept'' of whiteness in the United States, and notes that the definition and implications of a white racial identity have shifted over the decades. Yet Kolchin describes a \"persistent sense of unease \" with certain aspects of whiteness studies. There is no consensus definition of whiteness, and thus the word is used in vague and contradictory ways, with some scholars even leaving the term undefined in their articles or essays.\"<ref name=\"kolchin\"/> Kolchin also objects to \"a persistent dualism evident in the work of the best whiteness studies authors,\" who often claim that whiteness is a social construct while also arguing, paradoxically, that whiteness is an \"omnipresent and unchanging\" reality existing independent of socialization.<ref name=\"kolchin\"/> Kolchin agrees that entering a post-racial paradigm might be beneficial for humanity, but he challenges the didactic tone of whiteness studies scholars who single out a white racial identification as negative, while praising a black or Asian self-identification. Scholars in whiteness studies sometimes seriously undermine their arguments by interpreting historical evidence independent of its broader context (e.g., Karen Brodkin's examination of American anti-semitism largely neglects its roots in European anti-semitism). Finally, Kolchin categorically rejects the argument\u2014common amongst many whiteness scholars\u2014that racism and whiteness are intrinsically and uniquely American, and he expresses concern at the \"belief in the moral emptiness of whiteness [...] there is a thin line between saying that whiteness is evil and saying that whites are evil.\"<ref name=\"kolchin\"/>\n\n[[Theodore W.

The loose end is a lot longer and that goes around the body over the left shoulder. There is enough cloth left to cover the head as well. The modern style of wearing a sari originates from the Tagore family. [[Jnanadanandini Devi]], the wife of [[Rabindranath Tagore]]'s elder brother [[Satyendranath Tagore|Satyendranath]] came up with a different way to wear the sari after her stay in Bombay. This required a chemise or jacket (old name for blouse) and petticoat to be worn under the sari and made it possible for women to come out of the secluded women's quarters ([[purdah]]) in this attire.\n* [[Gujarati people|Gujarati]]/[[Rajasthani language|Rajasthani]] \u2013 after tucking in the pleats similar to the nivi style, the loose end is taken from the back, draped across the right shoulder, and pulled across to be secured in the back\n* [[Himachal Pradesh|Himalayan]] - Kulluvi Pattu is traditional form of woolen sari worn in Himachal Pradesh, similar variation is also worn in Uttarakhand.\n* [[Nepal|Nepali]]: Nepal has many different varieties of draping sari, today the most common is the Nivi drape.

The centre of the sari (held lengthwise) is placed at the centre back, the ends are brought forward and tied securely, then the two ends are wrapped around the legs. When worn as a sari, an extra-long cloth of nine yards is used and the ends are then passed up over the shoulders and the upper body. This style of draping is called as \"Navvari Sari\" (Kashta in Konkani). Women in villages of Maharashtra still drape their saris in this manner. The style worn by [[Brahmin]] women of differs from that of the [[Maratha]]s. The style also differs from community to community. This style is popular in [[Maharashtra]] and [[Goa]].

This necessitated a change of dress. Maharani [[Indira Devi]] of Cooch Behar popularised the [[chiffon (fabric)|chiffon]] sari. She was widowed early in life and followed the convention of abandoning her richly woven Baroda shalus in favour of the unadorned [[mourning]] white as per tradition. Characteristically, she transformed her \"[[mourning]]\" clothes into high fashion.

It homogenised fashion across this land. Its softness, lightness and beautiful, elegant, caressing drape was ideally suited to the Indian climate. Different courts adopted their own styles of draping and indigenising the sari. In most of the courts the sari was embellished with stitching hand-woven borders in gold from [[Varanasi]], delicate [[zardozi]] work, [[Gota (embroidery)|gota]], [[makaish]] and [[tilla]] work that embellished the plain fabric, simultaneously satisfying both traditional demands and ingrained love for ornamentation. Some images of maharanis in the Deccan show the women wearing a sleeveless, richly embellished waistcoat over their blouses. The Begum of Savanur remembers how sumptuous the chiffon sari became at their gatherings. At some courts, it was worn with jaali, or net [[kurta]]s and embossed silk waist length [[Sadri (clothing)|sadris]] or jackets.

Stylist [[Prasad Bidapa]] has to say, \"I think Sonia Gandhi is the country's most stylish politician. But that's because she's inherited the best collection of saris from her mother-in-law.

Most women who are married wear sharee as their regular dress while young-unmarried girls wear sharee as an occasional dress.\nThe ''shari'' is worn by women throughout Bangladesh. Sari is the most popular dress for [[women in Bangladesh]], both for casual and formal occasion. Although [[Jamdani|Dhakai Jamdani]] (hand made shari) is worldwide known and most famous to all women who wear shari but there are also many variety of shari in Bangladesh. There are many regional variations of them in both silk and cotton. e.g.- Tanta/Tant cotton shari, [[Dhakai]] [[Banarasi sari]], [[Rajshahi silk]], [[Tangail Sari]], [[Tant saree|Tant sari]], [[Tassar silk]] shari, [[Manipur]]i shari and Katan shari are the most popular in Bangladesh.\nIt is the uniform of the air hostesses of [[Biman Bangladesh Airlines]].\n\n==Sri Lanka==\n[[File:Kandyan Sinhalese Lady Wearing A Traditional Kandyan Saree (Osaria).jpg|thumb|[[Sinhalese people|Sinhalese]] lady wearing a traditional Kandyan sari ({{transl|si|osaria}}).]]\nSri Lankan women wear saris in many styles. Two ways of draping the sari are popular and tend to dominate: the Indian style (classic nivi drape) and the Kandyan style (or {{transl|si|osaria}} in Sinhala). The Kandyan style is generally more popular in the hill country region of Kandy from which the style gets its name. Though local preferences play a role, most women decide on style depending on personal preference or what is perceived to be most flattering for their figure.\n\nThe traditional Kandyan (osaria) style consists of a full blouse which covers the midriff completely and is partially tucked in at the front. However, the modern intermingling of styles has led to most wearers baring the midriff. The final tail of the sari is neatly pleated rather than free-flowing. This is rather similar to the pleated rosette used in the Dravidian style noted earlier in the article.\n\nThe Kandyan style is considered the national dress of Sinhalese women. It is the uniform of the air hostesses of [[SriLankan Airlines]].\n\nDuring the 1960s, the mini sari known as 'hipster' sari created a wrinkle in Sri Lankan fashion, since it was worn below the navel and barely above the line of prosecution for indecent exposure. The conservative people described the 'hipster' as \"''an absolute travesty of a beautiful costume almost a desecration''\" and \"''a hideous and purposeless garment''\".<ref>{{cite news|title=Minisaree causes uproar in Ceylon|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=0uRGAAAAIBAJ&sjid=_f0MAAAAIBAJ&pg=3053,1859967&dq=navel+saree&hl=en|accessdate=13 March 2012|newspaper=Gadsden Times|date=11 July 1969}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Eastern Miniskirt causes considerable uproar|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1955&dat=19690706&id=-sgtAAAAIBAJ&sjid=daAFAAAAIBAJ&pg=6108,2596939|accessdate=13 March 2012|newspaper=Reading Eagle|date=6 July 1969}}</ref>\n\n==Nepal==\nThe sari is the most commonly worn women's clothing in [[Nepal]] where a special style of sari draping is called ''haku patasihh''. The sari is draped around the waist and a shawl is worn covering the upper half of the sari, which is used in place of a ''pallu''.\n\n==Pakistan==\nIn Pakistan, the saris are still popular and worn on special occasions. The [[Shalwar kameez]], however, is worn throughout the country on a daily basis. The sari nevertheless remains a popular garment among the middle and upper class for many formal functions. Saris can be seen worn commonly in metropolitan cities such as Karachi and Islamabad and are worn regularly for weddings and other business types of functions. Saris are also worn by many [[Muslim]] women in Sindh to show their status or to enhance their beauty.\n<ref name=\"Asia Times&nbsp;\u2014 Sari\">{{cite web|url = http://www.atimes.com/atimes/South_Asia/IB23Df03.html| title = Bollywood, saris and a bombed train |work = Asia Times|accessdate = 31 August 2007}}</ref> The sari is worn as daily wear by [[Hinduism in Pakistan|Pakistani Hindus]], by elderly Muslim women who were used to wearing it in [[partition of India|pre-partition India]]<ref name=\"The Hindu&nbsp;\u2014 Sari\">{{cite news|url = http://www.hindu.com/thehindu/mag/2004/10/24/stories/2004102400380300.htm| title = The spread of the salwar|work=The Hindu |accessdate = 31 August 2007|location=Chennai, India|date=24 October 2004}}</ref> and by some of the new generation who have reintroduced the interest in saris.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}\n\n==Similarities with other Asian clothing==\nWhile the sari is typical to traditional wear for women in the Indian subcontinent, clothing worn by women in [[Southeast Asia]]n countries like [[Myanmar]], [[Malaysia]], the [[Philippines]], [[Cambodia]], [[Thailand]] and [[Laos]] resemble it, where a long rectangular piece of cloth is draped around the body. These are different from the sari as they are wrapped around the lower-half of body as a skirt, worn with a shirt/blouse and resemble a [[sarong]], as seen in the Burmese [[Longyi]], Filipino [[Malong]] and [[Tapis (Philippine clothing)|Tapis]], Laotian [[Xout lao]] and [[Suea pat]], Thai [[Sbai]] and [[Sinh (clothing)|Sinh]], Cambodian [[Sampot]] and Timorese [[Tais]]. Saris, worn predominantly in the Indian subcontinent are usually draped with one end of the cloth fastened around the waist, and the other end placed over the shoulder baring the midriff.<ref name=\"alkazi\"/><ref name=\"Boulanger\"/><ref name=\"Ghurye\"/>\n\n==Ornamentation and decorative accessories==\n[[File:Whitechapel dresses 1.jpg|thumb|200px|Display of traditional saris with [[Gota (embroidery)|gota patti]] embroidery for festive occasions at clothing store.]]\nSaris are woven with one plain end (the end that is concealed inside the wrap), two long decorative borders running the length of the sari, and a one to three-foot section at the other end which continues and elaborates the length-wise decoration. This end is called the ''pallu''; it is the part thrown over the shoulder in the nivi style of draping.\n\nIn past times, saris were woven of [[Silk in the Indian subcontinent|silk]] or cotton. The rich could afford finely woven, [[Transparency and translucency|diaphanous]] silk saris that, according to [[folklore]], could be passed through a [[finger ring]]. The poor wore coarsely woven cotton saris. All saris were [[weaving|handwoven]] and represented a considerable investment of time or money.\n\nSimple hand-woven villagers' saris are often decorated with checks or stripes woven into the cloth. Inexpensive saris were also decorated with [[block printing]] using carved wooden blocks and vegetable dyes, or [[tie-dye]]ing, known in India as ''bhandani'' work.\n\nMore expensive saris had elaborate geometric, floral, or figurative ornaments or brocades created on the [[Loom#Handloom|loom]], as part of the fabric. Sometimes warp and weft threads were tie-dyed and then woven, creating ''[[ikat]]'' patterns. Sometimes threads of different colours were woven into the base fabric in patterns; an ornamented border, an elaborate ''pallu'', and often, small repeated accents in the cloth itself. These accents are called ''buttis'' or ''bhuttis'' (spellings vary). For fancy saris, these patterns could be woven with [[Gold thread|gold or silver thread]], which is called ''[[zari]]'' work.\n\n[[File:WLA haa Gold belt Tamil Oddiyanam 3.jpg|thumb|200px|''Vaddanam'' or ''Kamarband'' is type of sari belt used to keep complex drapes in place.]]\nSometimes the saris were further decorated, after weaving, with various sorts of embroidery. ''Resham'' work is embroidery done with coloured silk thread. ''[[Zardozi]]'' embroidery uses gold and silver thread, and sometimes pearls and [[Gemstone|precious stones]]. Cheap modern versions of ''zardozi'' use synthetic metallic thread and imitation stones, such as fake pearls and [[Swarovski]] crystals.\n\nIn modern times, saris are increasingly woven on mechanical looms and made of artificial fibres, such as [[polyester]], nylon, or [[rayon]], which do not require starching or [[ironing]]. They are printed by machine, or woven in simple patterns made with ''floats'' across the back of the sari. This can create an elaborate appearance on the front, while looking ugly on the back. The ''punchra'' work is imitated with inexpensive machine-made tassel trim. Fashion designer [[Aaditya Sharma]] declared, \"I can drape a sari in 54 different styles\".<ref>{{cite news|last=Davina Raisinghani|title=Sari, it's a wrap|url=http://www.khaleejtimes.com/article/20090112/ARTICLE/301129953/1057|accessdate=20 March 2012|newspaper=Khaleej Times Online|date=12 January 2009}}</ref>\n\nHand-woven, hand-decorated saris are naturally much more expensive than the machine imitations. While the overall market for handweaving has plummeted (leading to much distress among Indian handweavers), [[weaving|hand-woven]] saris are still popular for weddings and other grand social occasions.\n\n==Sari outside the Indian subcontinent==\n[[File:Aishwarya bachchan.jpg|thumb|upright|200px|[[Aishwarya Bachchan|Aishwarya]] in a sari at the London premiere of her film ''[[Raavan]]''.]]\n\nThe traditional sari made an impact in the United States during the 1970s. Eugene Novack who ran the New York store, Royal Saree House told that he had been selling it mainly to the Indian women in New York area but later many American business women and housewives became his customers who preferred their saris to resemble the full gown of the western world. He also said that men appeared intrigued by the fragility and the femininity it confers on the wearer.<ref>{{cite news|title=Sari is coming trend in USA|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=tFcpAAAAIBAJ&sjid=Em4FAAAAIBAJ&pg=1193,261378&dq=midriff+saree&hl=en|accessdate=20 March 2012|newspaper=The Hour|date=4 January 1977}}</ref> Newcomers to the sari report that it is comfortable to wear, requiring no girdles or stockings and that the flowing garb feels so feminine with unusual grace.<ref>{{cite news|last=Helen Hennessy|title=Indian Sari is Exotic Style|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=xNxUAAAAIBAJ&sjid=WjwNAAAAIBAJ&pg=7026,3745850&dq=midriff+sari&hl=en|accessdate=20 March 2012|newspaper=The Leader-Post|date=20 April 1965}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Helen Hennessy|title=Stylish Set Only Six Yards Away From Sari Fashions. |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=PDtWAAAAIBAJ&sjid=QekDAAAAIBAJ&pg=6702,4336524&dq=midriff+sari&hl=en|accessdate=20 March 2012|newspaper=Eugene Register-Guard|date=22 April 1965}}</ref>\n\nThe sari has gained its popularity internationally because of the growth of Indian fashion trends globally.

The loose end is a lot longer and that goes around the body over the left shoulder. There is enough cloth left to cover the head as well. The modern style of wearing a sari originates from the Tagore family. [[Jnanadanandini Devi]], the wife of [[Rabindranath Tagore]]'s elder brother [[Satyendranath Tagore|Satyendranath]] came up with a different way to wear the sari after her stay in Bombay. This required a chemise or jacket (old name for blouse) and petticoat to be worn under the sari and made it possible for women to come out of the secluded women's quarters ([[purdah]]) in this attire.\n* [[Gujarati people|Gujarati]]/[[Rajasthani language|Rajasthani]] \u2013 after tucking in the pleats similar to the nivi style, the loose end is taken from the back, draped across the right shoulder, and pulled across to be secured in the back\n* [[Himachal Pradesh|Himalayan]] - Kulluvi Pattu is traditional form of woolen sari worn in Himachal Pradesh, similar variation is also worn in Uttarakhand.\n* [[Nepal|Nepali]]: Nepal has many different varieties of draping sari, today the most common is the Nivi drape.

The centre of the sari (held lengthwise) is placed at the centre back, the ends are brought forward and tied securely, then the two ends are wrapped around the legs. When worn as a sari, an extra-long cloth of nine yards is used and the ends are then passed up over the shoulders and the upper body. This style of draping is called as \"Navvari Sari\" (Kashta in Konkani). Women in villages of Maharashtra still drape their saris in this manner. The style worn by [[Brahmin]] women of differs from that of the [[Maratha]]s. The style also differs from community to community. This style is popular in [[Maharashtra]] and [[Goa]].

It homogenised fashion across this land. Its softness, lightness and beautiful, elegant, caressing drape was ideally suited to the Indian climate. Different courts adopted their own styles of draping and indigenising the sari. In most of the courts the sari was embellished with stitching hand-woven borders in gold from [[Varanasi]], delicate [[zardozi]] work, [[Gota (embroidery)|gota]], [[makaish]] and [[tilla]] work that embellished the plain fabric, simultaneously satisfying both traditional demands and ingrained love for ornamentation. Some images of maharanis in the Deccan show the women wearing a sleeveless, richly embellished waistcoat over their blouses. The Begum of Savanur remembers how sumptuous the chiffon sari became at their gatherings. At some courts, it was worn with jaali, or net [[kurta]]s and embossed silk waist length [[Sadri (clothing)|sadris]] or jackets. Some of them were so rich that the entire ground was embroidered over with pearls and zardozi.<ref name=\"A story of sartorial amalgamation\"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theluxecafe.com/fashion/clothes-accessories/royal-style-diaries-for-the-princess-in-you/|title=Royal style diaries for the princess in you|work=theluxecafe.com|accessdate=13 January 2017}}</ref>\n\nNivi drape starts with one end of the sari tucked into the [[waistband]] of the [[petticoat]], usually a plain [[skirt]]. The cloth is wrapped around the lower body once, then hand-gathered into even pleats below the navel. The pleats are tucked into the waistband of the petticoat.<ref name=\"Dongerkerry\">Dongerkerry, Kamala, S. (1959) ''The Indian sari''.

It is draped diagonally in front of the torso. It is worn across the right hip to over the left shoulder, partly baring the midriff.<ref name=\"Dongerkerry\"/> The navel can be revealed or concealed by the wearer by adjusting the ''pallu'', depending on the social setting. The long end of the ''pallu'' hanging from the back of the shoulder is often intricately decorated. The ''pallu'' may be hanging freely, tucked in at the waist, used to cover the head, or used to cover the neck, by draping it across the right shoulder as well. Some nivi styles are worn with the ''pallu'' draped from the back towards the front, coming from the back over the right shoulder with one corner tucked by the left hip, covering the torso/waist. The nivi sari was popularised through the paintings of [[Raja Ravi Varma]].<ref name=\"Miller\">Miller, Daniel & Banerjee, Mukulika, ''The Sari'' (2004), Lustre press / Roli books.</ref> In one of his paintings, the Indian subcontinent was shown as a mother wearing a flowing nivi sari.<ref name=\"Miller\"/> The ornaments generally accepted by the Hindu culture that can be worn in the midriff region are the [[waist chain]]s.

Most women who are married wear sharee as their regular dress while young-unmarried girls wear sharee as an occasional dress.\nThe ''shari'' is worn by women throughout Bangladesh. Sari is the most popular dress for [[women in Bangladesh]], both for casual and formal occasion. Although [[Jamdani|Dhakai Jamdani]] (hand made shari) is worldwide known and most famous to all women who wear shari but there are also many variety of shari in Bangladesh. There are many regional variations of them in both silk and cotton. e.g.- Tanta/Tant cotton shari, [[Dhakai]] [[Banarasi sari]], [[Rajshahi silk]], [[Tangail Sari]], [[Tant saree|Tant sari]], [[Tassar silk]] shari, [[Manipur]]i shari and Katan shari are the most popular in Bangladesh.\nIt is the uniform of the air hostesses of [[Biman Bangladesh Airlines]].\n\n==Sri Lanka==\n[[File:Kandyan Sinhalese Lady Wearing A Traditional Kandyan Saree (Osaria).jpg|thumb|[[Sinhalese people|Sinhalese]] lady wearing a traditional Kandyan sari ({{transl|si|osaria}}).]]\nSri Lankan women wear saris in many styles. Two ways of draping the sari are popular and tend to dominate: the Indian style (classic nivi drape) and the Kandyan style (or {{transl|si|osaria}} in Sinhala). The Kandyan style is generally more popular in the hill country region of Kandy from which the style gets its name. Though local preferences play a role, most women decide on style depending on personal preference or what is perceived to be most flattering for their figure.\n\nThe traditional Kandyan (osaria) style consists of a full blouse which covers the midriff completely and is partially tucked in at the front. However, the modern intermingling of styles has led to most wearers baring the midriff. The final tail of the sari is neatly pleated rather than free-flowing. This is rather similar to the pleated rosette used in the Dravidian style noted earlier in the article.\n\nThe Kandyan style is considered the national dress of Sinhalese women. It is the uniform of the air hostesses of [[SriLankan Airlines]].\n\nDuring the 1960s, the mini sari known as 'hipster' sari created a wrinkle in Sri Lankan fashion, since it was worn below the navel and barely above the line of prosecution for indecent exposure. The conservative people described the 'hipster' as \"''an absolute travesty of a beautiful costume almost a desecration''\" and \"''a hideous and purposeless garment''\".<ref>{{cite news|title=Minisaree causes uproar in Ceylon|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=0uRGAAAAIBAJ&sjid=_f0MAAAAIBAJ&pg=3053,1859967&dq=navel+saree&hl=en|accessdate=13 March 2012|newspaper=Gadsden Times|date=11 July 1969}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Eastern Miniskirt causes considerable uproar|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1955&dat=19690706&id=-sgtAAAAIBAJ&sjid=daAFAAAAIBAJ&pg=6108,2596939|accessdate=13 March 2012|newspaper=Reading Eagle|date=6 July 1969}}</ref>\n\n==Nepal==\nThe sari is the most commonly worn women's clothing in [[Nepal]] where a special style of sari draping is called ''haku patasihh''. The sari is draped around the waist and a shawl is worn covering the upper half of the sari, which is used in place of a ''pallu''.\n\n==Pakistan==\nIn Pakistan, the saris are still popular and worn on special occasions. The [[Shalwar kameez]], however, is worn throughout the country on a daily basis. The sari nevertheless remains a popular garment among the middle and upper class for many formal functions. Saris can be seen worn commonly in metropolitan cities such as Karachi and Islamabad and are worn regularly for weddings and other business types of functions.

These are different from the sari as they are wrapped around the lower-half of body as a skirt, worn with a shirt/blouse and resemble a [[sarong]], as seen in the Burmese [[Longyi]], Filipino [[Malong]] and [[Tapis (Philippine clothing)|Tapis]], Laotian [[Xout lao]] and [[Suea pat]], Thai [[Sbai]] and [[Sinh (clothing)|Sinh]], Cambodian [[Sampot]] and Timorese [[Tais]]. Saris, worn predominantly in the Indian subcontinent are usually draped with one end of the cloth fastened around the waist, and the other end placed over the shoulder baring the midriff.<ref name=\"alkazi\"/><ref name=\"Boulanger\"/><ref name=\"Ghurye\"/>\n\n==Ornamentation and decorative accessories==\n[[File:Whitechapel dresses 1.jpg|thumb|200px|Display of traditional saris with [[Gota (embroidery)|gota patti]] embroidery for festive occasions at clothing store.]]\nSaris are woven with one plain end (the end that is concealed inside the wrap), two long decorative borders running the length of the sari, and a one to three-foot section at the other end which continues and elaborates the length-wise decoration. This end is called the ''pallu''; it is the part thrown over the shoulder in the nivi style of draping.\n\nIn past times, saris were woven of [[Silk in the Indian subcontinent|silk]] or cotton. The rich could afford finely woven, [[Transparency and translucency|diaphanous]] silk saris that, according to [[folklore]], could be passed through a [[finger ring]]. The poor wore coarsely woven cotton saris. All saris were [[weaving|handwoven]] and represented a considerable investment of time or money.\n\nSimple hand-woven villagers' saris are often decorated with checks or stripes woven into the cloth. Inexpensive saris were also decorated with [[block printing]] using carved wooden blocks and vegetable dyes, or [[tie-dye]]ing, known in India as ''bhandani'' work.\n\nMore expensive saris had elaborate geometric, floral, or figurative ornaments or brocades created on the [[Loom#Handloom|loom]], as part of the fabric. Sometimes warp and weft threads were tie-dyed and then woven, creating ''[[ikat]]'' patterns. Sometimes threads of different colours were woven into the base fabric in patterns; an ornamented border, an elaborate ''pallu'', and often, small repeated accents in the cloth itself. These accents are called ''buttis'' or ''bhuttis'' (spellings vary). For fancy saris, these patterns could be woven with [[Gold thread|gold or silver thread]], which is called ''[[zari]]'' work.\n\n[[File:WLA haa Gold belt Tamil Oddiyanam 3.jpg|thumb|200px|''Vaddanam'' or ''Kamarband'' is type of sari belt used to keep complex drapes in place.]]\nSometimes the saris were further decorated, after weaving, with various sorts of embroidery. ''Resham'' work is embroidery done with coloured silk thread. ''[[Zardozi]]'' embroidery uses gold and silver thread, and sometimes pearls and [[Gemstone|precious stones]]. Cheap modern versions of ''zardozi'' use synthetic metallic thread and imitation stones, such as fake pearls and [[Swarovski]] crystals.\n\nIn modern times, saris are increasingly woven on mechanical looms and made of artificial fibres, such as [[polyester]], nylon, or [[rayon]], which do not require starching or [[ironing]]. They are printed by machine, or woven in simple patterns made with ''floats'' across the back of the sari. This can create an elaborate appearance on the front, while looking ugly on the back. The ''punchra'' work is imitated with inexpensive machine-made tassel trim. Fashion designer [[Aaditya Sharma]] declared, \"I can drape a sari in 54 different styles\".<ref>{{cite news|last=Davina Raisinghani|title=Sari, it's a wrap|url=http://www.khaleejtimes.com/article/20090112/ARTICLE/301129953/1057|accessdate=20 March 2012|newspaper=Khaleej Times Online|date=12 January 2009}}</ref>\n\nHand-woven, hand-decorated saris are naturally much more expensive than the machine imitations. While the overall market for handweaving has plummeted (leading to much distress among Indian handweavers), [[weaving|hand-woven]] saris are still popular for weddings and other grand social occasions.\n\n==Sari outside the Indian subcontinent==\n[[File:Aishwarya bachchan.jpg|thumb|upright|200px|[[Aishwarya Bachchan|Aishwarya]] in a sari at the London premiere of her film ''[[Raavan]]''.]]\n\nThe traditional sari made an impact in the United States during the 1970s. Eugene Novack who ran the New York store, Royal Saree House told that he had been selling it mainly to the Indian women in New York area but later many American business women and housewives became his customers who preferred their saris to resemble the full gown of the western world.

In this article, Cantor only applies his construction to the set of irrational numbers. See p. 254.)</ref> Cantor's work established the ubiquity of transcendental numbers.\n\nIn 1882, [[Ferdinand von Lindemann]] published the first complete proof of the transcendence of {{mvar|\u03c0}}. He first proved that {{math|''e''<sup>''a''</sup>}} is transcendental when {{mvar|a}} is any non-zero algebraic number. Then, since {{math|''e''<sup>''i''{{pi}}</sup> {{=}} \u22121}} is algebraic (see [[Euler's identity]]), {{math|''i''{{pi}}}} must be transcendental. But since {{math|''i''}} is algebraic, {{mvar|\u03c0}} therefore must be transcendental. This approach was generalized by [[Karl Weierstrass]] to what is now known as the [[Lindemann\u2013Weierstrass theorem]]. The transcendence of {{mvar|\u03c0}} allowed the proof of the impossibility of several ancient geometric constructions involving [[compass and straightedge]], including the most famous one, [[squaring the circle]].\n\nIn 1900, [[David Hilbert]] posed an influential question about transcendental numbers, [[Hilbert's seventh problem]]: If {{mvar|a}} is an algebraic number that is not zero or one, and {{mvar|b}} is an irrational [[algebraic number]], is {{math|''a''<sup>''b''</sup>}} necessarily transcendental? The affirmative answer was provided in 1934 by the [[Gelfond\u2013Schneider theorem]]. This work was extended by [[Alan Baker (mathematician)|Alan Baker]] in the 1960s in his work on lower bounds for linear forms in any number of logarithms (of algebraic numbers).<ref>J J O'Connor and E F Robertson: [http://www-history.mcs.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Baker_Alan.html Alan Baker]. The MacTutor History of Mathematics archive 1998.</ref>\n\n==Properties==\nThe set of transcendental numbers is [[uncountable|uncountably infinite]]. Since the polynomials with rational coefficients are [[countable]], and since each such polynomial has a finite number of [[root of a function|zeroes]], the [[algebraic number]]s must also be countable. However, [[Cantor's diagonal argument]] proves that the real numbers (and therefore also the complex numbers) are uncountable. Since the real numbers are the union of algebraic and transcendental numbers, they cannot both be countable. This makes the transcendental numbers uncountable.\n\nNo [[rational number]] is transcendental and all real transcendental numbers are irrational. The [[irrational number]]s contain all the real transcendental numbers and a [[subset]] of the algebraic numbers, including the [[quadratic irrational]]s and other forms of algebraic irrationals.\n\nAny non-constant [[algebraic function]] of a single variable yields a transcendental value when applied to a transcendental argument. For example, from knowing that {{pi}} is transcendental, it can be immediately deduced that numbers such as <math>5\\pi</math>, <math>\\frac{\\pi-3}{\\sqrt{2}}</math>, <math>\\left(\\sqrt{\\pi}-\\sqrt{3}\\right)^8</math>, and <math>\\sqrt[4]{\\pi^5+7}</math> are transcendental as well.\n\nHowever, an algebraic function of several variables may yield an algebraic number when applied to transcendental numbers if these numbers are not [[algebraically independent]]. For example, {{pi}} and (1 \u2212 {{pi}}) are both transcendental, but {{pi}} + (1 \u2212 {{pi}}) = 1 is obviously not. It is unknown whether {{pi}} + ''e'', for example, is transcendental, though at least one of {{pi}} + ''e'' and {{pi}}''e'' must be transcendental. More generally, for any two transcendental numbers ''a'' and ''b'', at least one of ''a'' + ''b'' and ''ab'' must be transcendental. To see this, consider the polynomial (''x'' \u2212 ''a'')(''x'' \u2212 ''b'') = ''x''<sup>2</sup> \u2212 (''a'' + ''b'')''x'' + ''ab''. If (''a'' + ''b'') and ''ab'' were both algebraic, then this would be a polynomial with algebraic coefficients. Because algebraic numbers form an [[algebraically closed field]], this would imply that the roots of the polynomial, ''a'' and ''b'', must be algebraic. But this is a contradiction, and thus it must be the case that at least one of the coefficients is transcendental.\n\nThe [[computable number|non-computable numbers]] are a [[strict subset]] of the transcendental numbers.\n\nAll [[Liouville number]]s are transcendental, but not vice versa. Any Liouville number must have unbounded partial quotients in its [[continued fraction]] expansion. Using a [[counting argument]] one can show that there exist transcendental numbers which have bounded partial quotients and hence are not Liouville numbers.\n\nUsing the explicit continued fraction expansion of ''e'', one can show that ''e'' is not a Liouville number (although the partial quotients in its continued fraction expansion are unbounded). [[Kurt Mahler]] showed in 1953 that {{pi}} is also not a Liouville number. It is conjectured that all infinite continued fractions with bounded terms that are not eventually periodic are transcendental (eventually periodic continued fractions correspond to quadratic irrationals).<ref>{{cite journal|title=On the complexity of algebraic numbers, II.

We will now follow the strategy of [[David Hilbert]] (1862\u20131943) who gave a simplification of the original proof of [[Charles Hermite]]. The idea is the following:\n\nAssume, for purpose of finding a contradiction, that ''e'' is algebraic. Then there exists a finite set of integer coefficients ''c''<sub>0</sub>, ''c''<sub>1</sub>, ..., ''c<sub>n</sub>'' satisfying the equation:\n\n:<math>c_{0}+c_{1}e+c_{2}e^{2}+\\cdots+c_{n}e^{n}=0, \\qquad c_0, c_n \\neq 0.</math>\n\nNow for a positive integer ''k'', we define the following polynomial:\n\n:<math> f_k(x) = x^{k} \\left [(x-1)\\cdots(x-n) \\right ]^{k+1},</math>\n\nand multiply both sides of the above equation by\n\n:<math>\\int^{\\infty}_{0} f_k e^{-x}\\,dx,</math>\n\nto arrive at the equation:\n\n:<math>c_{0} \\left (\\int^{\\infty}_{0} f_k e^{-x}\\,dx\\right )+ c_1e\\left ( \\int^{\\infty}_{0}f_k e^{-x}\\,dx\\right )+\\cdots+ c_{n}e^{n} \\left (\\int^{\\infty}_{0}f_k e^{-x}\\,dx\\right ) = 0.</math>\n\nThis equation can be written in the form\n\n:<math>P+Q=0</math>\n\nwhere\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\nP &= c_{0}\\left ( \\int^{\\infty}_{0}f_k e^{-x}\\,dx\\right )+ c_{1}e\\left (\\int^{\\infty}_{1}f_k e^{-x}\\,dx\\right )+ c_{2}e^{2}\\left (\\int^{\\infty}_{2}f_k e^{-x}\\,dx\\right ) +\\cdots+ c_{n}e^{n}\\left (\\int^{\\infty}_{n}f_k e^{-x}\\,dx\\right ) \\\\\nQ &= c_{1}e\\left (\\int^{1}_{0} f_k e^{-x}\\,dx\\right )+c_{2}e^{2} \\left (\\int^{2}_{0} f_k e^{-x}\\,dx\\right )+\\cdots+c_{n}e^{n}\\left (\\int^{n}_{0} f_k e^{-x}\\,dx \\right ) \n\\end{align}</math>\n\n'''Lemma 1.''' For an appropriate choice of ''k'', <math>\\tfrac{P}{k!}</math> is a non-zero integer.\n\n<blockquote>'''Proof.''' Each term in ''P'' is an integer times a sum of factorials, which results from the relation\n\n:<math>\\int^{\\infty}_{0}x^{j}e^{-x}\\,dx=j!</math>\n\nwhich is valid for any positive integer ''j'' (consider the [[Gamma function]]).\n\nIt is non-zero because for every ''a'' satisfying 0< ''a'' \u2264 ''n'', the integrand in\n\n:<math>c_{a}e^{a}\\int^{\\infty}_{a} f_k e^{-x}\\,dx</math>\n\nis ''e<sup>\u2212x</sup>'' times a sum of terms whose lowest power of ''x'' is ''k''+1 after substituting ''x'' for ''x''+''a'' in the integral. Then this becomes a sum of integrals of the form\n\n:<math>A_{j-k}\\int^{\\infty}_{0}x^{j}e^{-x}\\,dx</math> Where ''A''<sub>j-k</sub> is integer.\n\nwith ''k''+1 \u2264 ''j'', and it is therefore an integer divisible by (''k''+1)!. After dividing by ''k!'', we get zero [[Modular arithmetic|modulo]] (''k''+1). However, we can write:\n\n:<math>\\int^{\\infty}_{0} f_k e^{-x}\\,dx = \\int^{\\infty}_{0} \\left ( \\left [(-1)^{n}(n!) \\right ]^{k+1}e^{-x}x^k + \\cdots \\right ) dx</math>\n\nand thus\n\n:<math>{\\frac {1}{k!}}c_{0}\\int _{0}^{\\infty }f_{k}e^{-x}\\,dx\\equiv c_{0}[(-1)^{n}(n!)]^{k+1}\\not\\equiv 0{\\pmod {k+1}}.</math>\n\nSo when dividing each integral in ''P'' by ''k!'', the initial one is not divisible by ''k''+1, but all the others are, as long as ''k''+1 is prime and larger than ''n'' and |''c''<sub>0</sub>|. It follows that <math>\\tfrac{P}{k!}</math> itself is not divisible by the prime ''k''+1 and therefore cannot be zero.</blockquote>\n\n'''Lemma 2.''' <math>\\left|\\tfrac{Q}{k!}\\right|<1</math> for sufficiently large <math>k</math>.\n\n<blockquote> '''Proof.''' Note that\n\n:<math>\\begin{align} \nf_k e^{-x} &= x^{k}[(x-1)(x-2)\\cdots(x-n)]^{k+1}e^{-x}\\\\\n&= \\left (x(x-1)\\cdots(x-n) \\right)^k \\cdot \\left ((x-1)\\cdots(x-n)e^{-x}\\right)\\\\\n&= u(x)^k \\cdot v(x)\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nwhere <math>u(x)</math> and <math>v(x)</math> are continuous functions of <math>x</math> for all <math>x</math>, so are bounded on the interval <math>[0,n]</math>. That is, there are constants <math>G, H > 0</math> such that\n\n:<math> \\left |f_k e^{-x} \\right | \\leq |u(x)|^k \\cdot |v(x)| < G^k H \\quad \\text{ for } 0 \\leq x \\leq n.</math>\n\nSo each of those integrals composing <math>Q</math> is bounded, the worst case being\n\n:<math>\\left|\\int_{0}^{n}f_{k}e^{-x}\\,dx\\right| \\leq \\int_{0}^{n} \\left |f_{k}e^{-x} \\right |\\,dx \\leq \\int_{0}^{n}G^k H\\,dx = nG^k H.</math>\n\nIt is now possible to bound the sum <math>Q</math> as well:\n\n:<math>|Q| < G^{k} \\cdot nH \\left (|c_1|e+|c_2|e^2+\\cdots+|c_n|e^{n} \\right ) = G^k \\cdot M,</math>\n\nwhere <math>M</math> is a constant not depending on <math>k</math>. It follows that\n\n:<math>\\left| \\frac{Q}{k!} \\right| < M \\cdot \\frac{G^k}{k!} \\to 0 \\quad \\text{ as } k \\to \\infty,</math>\n\nfinishing the proof of this lemma.</blockquote>\n\nChoosing a value of <math>k</math> satisfying both lemmas leads to a non-zero integer (<math>P/k!</math>) added to a vanishingly small quantity (<math>Q/k!</math>) being equal to zero, is an impossibility. It follows that the original assumption, that <math>e</math> can satisfy a polynomial equation with integer coefficients, is also impossible; that is, <math>e</math> is transcendental.\n\n===The transcendence of {{pi}}===\nA similar strategy, different from [[Ferdinand von Lindemann|Lindemann]]'s original approach, can be used to show that the [[Pi|number {{pi}}]] is transcendental. Besides the [[gamma-function]] and some estimates as in the proof for ''e'', facts about [[symmetric polynomial]]s play a vital role in the proof.\n\nFor detailed information concerning the proofs of the transcendence of {{pi}} and ''e,'' see the references and external links.\n\n==Mahler's classification==\n[[Kurt Mahler]] in 1932 partitioned the transcendental numbers into 3 classes, called '''S''', '''T''', and '''U'''.<ref name=Bug250>Bugeaud (2012) p.250</ref>  Definition of these classes draws on an extension of the idea of a [[Liouville number]] (cited above).\n\n===Measure of irrationality of a real number===\nOne way to define a Liouville number is to consider how small a given real number '''x''' makes linear polynomials |''qx''&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;''p''| without making them exactly&nbsp;0.  Here ''p'', ''q'' are integers with |''p''|, |''q''| bounded by a positive integer&nbsp;''H''.\n\nLet ''m''(''x'',&nbsp;1,&nbsp;''H'') be the minimum non-zero absolute value these polynomials take and take:\n\n:<math>\\omega(x, 1, H) = - \\frac{\\log m(x, 1, H)}{\\log H}</math>\n:<math>\\omega(x, 1)= \\limsup_{H\\to\\infty} \\omega(x,1,H).</math>\n\n\u03c9(''x'',&nbsp;1) is often called the '''measure of irrationality''' of a real number&nbsp;''x''. For rational numbers, \u03c9(''x'',&nbsp;1) = 0 and is at least 1 for irrational real numbers. A Liouville number is defined to have infinite measure of irrationality. [[Roth's theorem]] says that irrational real algebraic numbers have measure of irrationality 1.\n\n===Measure of transcendence of a complex number===\nNext consider the values of polynomials at a complex number ''x'', when these polynomials have integer coefficients, degree at most ''n'', and [[Height of a polynomial|height]] at most ''H'', with ''n'', ''H'' being positive integers.\n\nLet m(''x'',''n'',''H'') be the minimum non-zero absolute value such polynomials take at ''x'' and take:\n:<math>\\omega(x, n, H) = - \\frac{\\log m(x, n, H)}{n\\log H}</math>\n:<math>\\omega(x, n)= \\limsup_{H\\to\\infty} \\omega(x,n,H).</math>\n\nSuppose this is infinite for some minimum positive integer&nbsp;''n''.  A complex number ''x'' in this case is called a '''U&nbsp;number''' of degree&nbsp;''n''.\n\nNow we can define \n:<math>\\omega (x) =\\limsup_{n\\to\\infty}\\omega(x,n).</math> \n\u03c9(''x'') is often called the '''measure of transcendence''' of&nbsp;''x''. If the \u03c9(''x'',''n'') are bounded, then \u03c9(''x'') is finite, and ''x'' is called an '''S number'''.  If the \u03c9(''x'',''n'') are finite but unbounded, ''x'' is called a '''T number'''. ''x''&nbsp;is algebraic if and only if&nbsp;\u03c9(''x'')&nbsp;=&nbsp;0.\n\nClearly the Liouville numbers are a subset of the U numbers.  [[William LeVeque]] in 1953 constructed U numbers of any desired degree.<ref name=\"Baker, p. 86\">Baker (1975) p. 86.</ref><ref name=LV172>LeVeque (2002) p.II:172</ref> The [[Liouville numbers]] and hence the U numbers are uncountable sets.

[[Wolfgang M. Schmidt]] in 1968 showed that examples exist.  However, [[almost all]] complex numbers are S numbers.<ref name=Bug251/> Mahler proved that the exponential function sends all non-zero algebraic numbers to S numbers:<ref>LeVeque (2002) pp.II:174\u2013186</ref><ref>Burger and Tubbs, p. 182.</ref> this shows that ''e'' is an S number and gives a proof of the transcendence of {{pi}}.  The most that is known about {{pi}} is that it is not a U number.  Many other transcendental numbers remain unclassified.\n\nTwo numbers ''x'', ''y'' are called '''algebraically dependent''' if there is a non-zero polynomial ''P'' in 2 indeterminates with integer coefficients such that ''P''(''x'',&nbsp;''y'')&nbsp;=&nbsp;0.

In this article, Cantor only applies his construction to the set of irrational numbers. See p. 254.)</ref> Cantor's work established the ubiquity of transcendental numbers.\n\nIn 1882, [[Ferdinand von Lindemann]] published the first complete proof of the transcendence of {{mvar|\u03c0}}. He first proved that {{math|''e''<sup>''a''</sup>}} is transcendental when {{mvar|a}} is any non-zero algebraic number. Then, since {{math|''e''<sup>''i''{{pi}}</sup> {{=}} \u22121}} is algebraic (see [[Euler's identity]]), {{math|''i''{{pi}}}} must be transcendental. But since {{math|''i''}} is algebraic, {{mvar|\u03c0}} therefore must be transcendental. This approach was generalized by [[Karl Weierstrass]] to what is now known as the [[Lindemann\u2013Weierstrass theorem]]. The transcendence of {{mvar|\u03c0}} allowed the proof of the impossibility of several ancient geometric constructions involving [[compass and straightedge]], including the most famous one, [[squaring the circle]].\n\nIn 1900, [[David Hilbert]] posed an influential question about transcendental numbers, [[Hilbert's seventh problem]]: If {{mvar|a}} is an algebraic number that is not zero or one, and {{mvar|b}} is an irrational [[algebraic number]], is {{math|''a''<sup>''b''</sup>}} necessarily transcendental? The affirmative answer was provided in 1934 by the [[Gelfond\u2013Schneider theorem]]. This work was extended by [[Alan Baker (mathematician)|Alan Baker]] in the 1960s in his work on lower bounds for linear forms in any number of logarithms (of algebraic numbers).<ref>J J O'Connor and E F Robertson: [http://www-history.mcs.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Baker_Alan.html Alan Baker]. The MacTutor History of Mathematics archive 1998.</ref>\n\n==Properties==\nThe set of transcendental numbers is [[uncountable|uncountably infinite]]. Since the polynomials with rational coefficients are [[countable]], and since each such polynomial has a finite number of [[root of a function|zeroes]], the [[algebraic number]]s must also be countable. However, [[Cantor's diagonal argument]] proves that the real numbers (and therefore also the complex numbers) are uncountable. Since the real numbers are the union of algebraic and transcendental numbers, they cannot both be countable. This makes the transcendental numbers uncountable.\n\nNo [[rational number]] is transcendental and all real transcendental numbers are irrational. The [[irrational number]]s contain all the real transcendental numbers and a [[subset]] of the algebraic numbers, including the [[quadratic irrational]]s and other forms of algebraic irrationals.\n\nAny non-constant [[algebraic function]] of a single variable yields a transcendental value when applied to a transcendental argument. For example, from knowing that {{pi}} is transcendental, it can be immediately deduced that numbers such as <math>5\\pi</math>, <math>\\frac{\\pi-3}{\\sqrt{2}}</math>, <math>\\left(\\sqrt{\\pi}-\\sqrt{3}\\right)^8</math>, and <math>\\sqrt[4]{\\pi^5+7}</math> are transcendental as well.\n\nHowever, an algebraic function of several variables may yield an algebraic number when applied to transcendental numbers if these numbers are not [[algebraically independent]]. For example, {{pi}} and (1 \u2212 {{pi}}) are both transcendental, but {{pi}} + (1 \u2212 {{pi}}) = 1 is obviously not. It is unknown whether {{pi}} + ''e'', for example, is transcendental, though at least one of {{pi}} + ''e'' and {{pi}}''e'' must be transcendental. More generally, for any two transcendental numbers ''a'' and ''b'', at least one of ''a'' + ''b'' and ''ab'' must be transcendental. To see this, consider the polynomial (''x'' \u2212 ''a'')(''x'' \u2212 ''b'') = ''x''<sup>2</sup> \u2212 (''a'' + ''b'')''x'' + ''ab''. If (''a'' + ''b'') and ''ab'' were both algebraic, then this would be a polynomial with algebraic coefficients. Because algebraic numbers form an [[algebraically closed field]], this would imply that the roots of the polynomial, ''a'' and ''b'', must be algebraic. But this is a contradiction, and thus it must be the case that at least one of the coefficients is transcendental.\n\nThe [[computable number|non-computable numbers]] are a [[strict subset]] of the transcendental numbers.\n\nAll [[Liouville number]]s are transcendental, but not vice versa. Any Liouville number must have unbounded partial quotients in its [[continued fraction]] expansion. Using a [[counting argument]] one can show that there exist transcendental numbers which have bounded partial quotients and hence are not Liouville numbers.\n\nUsing the explicit continued fraction expansion of ''e'', one can show that ''e'' is not a Liouville number (although the partial quotients in its continued fraction expansion are unbounded). [[Kurt Mahler]] showed in 1953 that {{pi}} is also not a Liouville number. It is conjectured that all infinite continued fractions with bounded terms that are not eventually periodic are transcendental (eventually periodic continued fractions correspond to quadratic irrationals).<ref>{{cite journal|title=On the complexity of algebraic numbers, II.

We will now follow the strategy of [[David Hilbert]] (1862\u20131943) who gave a simplification of the original proof of [[Charles Hermite]]. The idea is the following:\n\nAssume, for purpose of finding a contradiction, that ''e'' is algebraic. Then there exists a finite set of integer coefficients ''c''<sub>0</sub>, ''c''<sub>1</sub>, ..., ''c<sub>n</sub>'' satisfying the equation:\n\n:<math>c_{0}+c_{1}e+c_{2}e^{2}+\\cdots+c_{n}e^{n}=0, \\qquad c_0, c_n \\neq 0.</math>\n\nNow for a positive integer ''k'', we define the following polynomial:\n\n:<math> f_k(x) = x^{k} \\left [(x-1)\\cdots(x-n) \\right ]^{k+1},</math>\n\nand multiply both sides of the above equation by\n\n:<math>\\int^{\\infty}_{0} f_k e^{-x}\\,dx,</math>\n\nto arrive at the equation:\n\n:<math>c_{0} \\left (\\int^{\\infty}_{0} f_k e^{-x}\\,dx\\right )+ c_1e\\left ( \\int^{\\infty}_{0}f_k e^{-x}\\,dx\\right )+\\cdots+ c_{n}e^{n} \\left (\\int^{\\infty}_{0}f_k e^{-x}\\,dx\\right ) = 0.</math>\n\nThis equation can be written in the form\n\n:<math>P+Q=0</math>\n\nwhere\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\nP &= c_{0}\\left ( \\int^{\\infty}_{0}f_k e^{-x}\\,dx\\right )+ c_{1}e\\left (\\int^{\\infty}_{1}f_k e^{-x}\\,dx\\right )+ c_{2}e^{2}\\left (\\int^{\\infty}_{2}f_k e^{-x}\\,dx\\right ) +\\cdots+ c_{n}e^{n}\\left (\\int^{\\infty}_{n}f_k e^{-x}\\,dx\\right ) \\\\\nQ &= c_{1}e\\left (\\int^{1}_{0} f_k e^{-x}\\,dx\\right )+c_{2}e^{2} \\left (\\int^{2}_{0} f_k e^{-x}\\,dx\\right )+\\cdots+c_{n}e^{n}\\left (\\int^{n}_{0} f_k e^{-x}\\,dx \\right ) \n\\end{align}</math>\n\n'''Lemma 1.''' For an appropriate choice of ''k'', <math>\\tfrac{P}{k!}</math> is a non-zero integer.\n\n<blockquote>'''Proof.''' Each term in ''P'' is an integer times a sum of factorials, which results from the relation\n\n:<math>\\int^{\\infty}_{0}x^{j}e^{-x}\\,dx=j!</math>\n\nwhich is valid for any positive integer ''j'' (consider the [[Gamma function]]).\n\nIt is non-zero because for every ''a'' satisfying 0< ''a'' \u2264 ''n'', the integrand in\n\n:<math>c_{a}e^{a}\\int^{\\infty}_{a} f_k e^{-x}\\,dx</math>\n\nis ''e<sup>\u2212x</sup>'' times a sum of terms whose lowest power of ''x'' is ''k''+1 after substituting ''x'' for ''x''+''a'' in the integral. Then this becomes a sum of integrals of the form\n\n:<math>A_{j-k}\\int^{\\infty}_{0}x^{j}e^{-x}\\,dx</math> Where ''A''<sub>j-k</sub> is integer.\n\nwith ''k''+1 \u2264 ''j'', and it is therefore an integer divisible by (''k''+1)!. After dividing by ''k!'', we get zero [[Modular arithmetic|modulo]] (''k''+1). However, we can write:\n\n:<math>\\int^{\\infty}_{0} f_k e^{-x}\\,dx = \\int^{\\infty}_{0} \\left ( \\left [(-1)^{n}(n!) \\right ]^{k+1}e^{-x}x^k + \\cdots \\right ) dx</math>\n\nand thus\n\n:<math>{\\frac {1}{k!}}c_{0}\\int _{0}^{\\infty }f_{k}e^{-x}\\,dx\\equiv c_{0}[(-1)^{n}(n!)]^{k+1}\\not\\equiv 0{\\pmod {k+1}}.</math>\n\nSo when dividing each integral in ''P'' by ''k!'', the initial one is not divisible by ''k''+1, but all the others are, as long as ''k''+1 is prime and larger than ''n'' and |''c''<sub>0</sub>|. It follows that <math>\\tfrac{P}{k!}</math> itself is not divisible by the prime ''k''+1 and therefore cannot be zero.</blockquote>\n\n'''Lemma 2.''' <math>\\left|\\tfrac{Q}{k!}\\right|<1</math> for sufficiently large <math>k</math>.\n\n<blockquote> '''Proof.''' Note that\n\n:<math>\\begin{align} \nf_k e^{-x} &= x^{k}[(x-1)(x-2)\\cdots(x-n)]^{k+1}e^{-x}\\\\\n&= \\left (x(x-1)\\cdots(x-n) \\right)^k \\cdot \\left ((x-1)\\cdots(x-n)e^{-x}\\right)\\\\\n&= u(x)^k \\cdot v(x)\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nwhere <math>u(x)</math> and <math>v(x)</math> are continuous functions of <math>x</math> for all <math>x</math>, so are bounded on the interval <math>[0,n]</math>. That is, there are constants <math>G, H > 0</math> such that\n\n:<math> \\left |f_k e^{-x} \\right | \\leq |u(x)|^k \\cdot |v(x)| < G^k H \\quad \\text{ for } 0 \\leq x \\leq n.</math>\n\nSo each of those integrals composing <math>Q</math> is bounded, the worst case being\n\n:<math>\\left|\\int_{0}^{n}f_{k}e^{-x}\\,dx\\right| \\leq \\int_{0}^{n} \\left |f_{k}e^{-x} \\right |\\,dx \\leq \\int_{0}^{n}G^k H\\,dx = nG^k H.</math>\n\nIt is now possible to bound the sum <math>Q</math> as well:\n\n:<math>|Q| < G^{k} \\cdot nH \\left (|c_1|e+|c_2|e^2+\\cdots+|c_n|e^{n} \\right ) = G^k \\cdot M,</math>\n\nwhere <math>M</math> is a constant not depending on <math>k</math>. It follows that\n\n:<math>\\left| \\frac{Q}{k!} \\right| < M \\cdot \\frac{G^k}{k!} \\to 0 \\quad \\text{ as } k \\to \\infty,</math>\n\nfinishing the proof of this lemma.</blockquote>\n\nChoosing a value of <math>k</math> satisfying both lemmas leads to a non-zero integer (<math>P/k!</math>) added to a vanishingly small quantity (<math>Q/k!</math>) being equal to zero, is an impossibility. It follows that the original assumption, that <math>e</math> can satisfy a polynomial equation with integer coefficients, is also impossible; that is, <math>e</math> is transcendental.\n\n===The transcendence of {{pi}}===\nA similar strategy, different from [[Ferdinand von Lindemann|Lindemann]]'s original approach, can be used to show that the [[Pi|number {{pi}}]] is transcendental. Besides the [[gamma-function]] and some estimates as in the proof for ''e'', facts about [[symmetric polynomial]]s play a vital role in the proof.\n\nFor detailed information concerning the proofs of the transcendence of {{pi}} and ''e,'' see the references and external links.\n\n==Mahler's classification==\n[[Kurt Mahler]] in 1932 partitioned the transcendental numbers into 3 classes, called '''S''', '''T''', and '''U'''.<ref name=Bug250>Bugeaud (2012) p.250</ref>  Definition of these classes draws on an extension of the idea of a [[Liouville number]] (cited above).\n\n===Measure of irrationality of a real number===\nOne way to define a Liouville number is to consider how small a given real number '''x''' makes linear polynomials |''qx''&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;''p''| without making them exactly&nbsp;0.  Here ''p'', ''q'' are integers with |''p''|, |''q''| bounded by a positive integer&nbsp;''H''.\n\nLet ''m''(''x'',&nbsp;1,&nbsp;''H'') be the minimum non-zero absolute value these polynomials take and take:\n\n:<math>\\omega(x, 1, H) = - \\frac{\\log m(x, 1, H)}{\\log H}</math>\n:<math>\\omega(x, 1)= \\limsup_{H\\to\\infty} \\omega(x,1,H).</math>\n\n\u03c9(''x'',&nbsp;1) is often called the '''measure of irrationality''' of a real number&nbsp;''x''. For rational numbers, \u03c9(''x'',&nbsp;1) = 0 and is at least 1 for irrational real numbers. A Liouville number is defined to have infinite measure of irrationality. [[Roth's theorem]] says that irrational real algebraic numbers have measure of irrationality 1.\n\n===Measure of transcendence of a complex number===\nNext consider the values of polynomials at a complex number ''x'', when these polynomials have integer coefficients, degree at most ''n'', and [[Height of a polynomial|height]] at most ''H'', with ''n'', ''H'' being positive integers.\n\nLet m(''x'',''n'',''H'') be the minimum non-zero absolute value such polynomials take at ''x'' and take:\n:<math>\\omega(x, n, H) = - \\frac{\\log m(x, n, H)}{n\\log H}</math>\n:<math>\\omega(x, n)= \\limsup_{H\\to\\infty} \\omega(x,n,H).</math>\n\nSuppose this is infinite for some minimum positive integer&nbsp;''n''.  A complex number ''x'' in this case is called a '''U&nbsp;number''' of degree&nbsp;''n''.\n\nNow we can define \n:<math>\\omega (x) =\\limsup_{n\\to\\infty}\\omega(x,n).</math> \n\u03c9(''x'') is often called the '''measure of transcendence''' of&nbsp;''x''. If the \u03c9(''x'',''n'') are bounded, then \u03c9(''x'') is finite, and ''x'' is called an '''S number'''.  If the \u03c9(''x'',''n'') are finite but unbounded, ''x'' is called a '''T number'''. ''x''&nbsp;is algebraic if and only if&nbsp;\u03c9(''x'')&nbsp;=&nbsp;0.\n\nClearly the Liouville numbers are a subset of the U numbers.  [[William LeVeque]] in 1953 constructed U numbers of any desired degree.<ref name=\"Baker, p. 86\">Baker (1975) p. 86.</ref><ref name=LV172>LeVeque (2002) p.II:172</ref> The [[Liouville numbers]] and hence the U numbers are uncountable sets. They are sets of measure 0.<ref>Burger and Tubbs, p. 170.</ref>\n\nT numbers also comprise a set of measure 0.<ref>Burger and Tubbs, p. 172.</ref> It took about 35 years to show their existence. [[Wolfgang M. Schmidt]] in 1968 showed that examples exist.  However, [[almost all]] complex numbers are S numbers.<ref name=Bug251/> Mahler proved that the exponential function sends all non-zero algebraic numbers to S numbers:<ref>LeVeque (2002) pp.II:174\u2013186</ref><ref>Burger and Tubbs, p. 182.</ref> this shows that ''e'' is an S number and gives a proof of the transcendence of {{pi}}.  The most that is known about {{pi}} is that it is not a U number.  Many other transcendental numbers remain unclassified.\n\nTwo numbers ''x'', ''y'' are called '''algebraically dependent''' if there is a non-zero polynomial ''P'' in 2 indeterminates with integer coefficients such that ''P''(''x'',&nbsp;''y'')&nbsp;=&nbsp;0. There is a powerful theorem that 2 complex numbers that are algebraically dependent belong to the same Mahler class.<ref name=LV172/><ref>Burger and Tubbs, p. 163.</ref>  This allows construction of new transcendental numbers, such as the sum of a Liouville number with ''e'' or&nbsp;{{pi}}.\n\nThe symbol S probably stood for the name of Mahler's teacher [[Carl Ludwig Siegel]], and T and U are just the next two letters.\n\n===Koksma's equivalent classification===\n[[Jurjen Koksma]] in 1939 proposed another classification based on approximation by algebraic numbers.<ref name=Bug250/><ref name=Baker87>Baker (1975) p.87</ref>\n\nConsider the approximation of a complex number ''x'' by algebraic numbers of degree \u2264&nbsp;''n'' and height \u2264&nbsp;''H''. Let \u03b1 be an algebraic number of this finite set such that |''x''&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;\u03b1| has the minimum positive value. Define \u03c9*(''x'',''H'',''n'') and \u03c9*(''x'',''n'') by:\n\n:<math>|x-\\alpha| = H^{-n\\omega^*(x,H,n)-1}.</math>\n:<math>\\omega^*(x,n) = \\limsup_{H\\to\\infty} \\omega^*(x,n,H).</math>\n\nIf for a smallest positive integer ''n'', \u03c9*(''x'',''n'') is infinite, ''x'' is called a '''U*-number''' of degree&nbsp;''n''.\n\nIf the \u03c9*(''x'',''n'') are bounded and do not converge to 0, ''x'' is called an '''S*-number''',\n\nA number ''x'' is called an '''A*-number''' if the \u03c9*(''x'',''n'') converge to&nbsp;0.\n\nIf the \u03c9*(''x'',''n'') are all finite but unbounded, ''x'' is called a '''T*-number''',\n\nKoksma's and Mahler's classifications are equivalent in that they divide the transcendental numbers into the same classes.<ref name=Baker87/> The ''A*''-numbers are the algebraic numbers.<ref name=Bug251>Bugeaud (2012) p.251</ref>\n\n===LeVeque's construction===\n\nLet\n\n:<math>\\lambda= \\tfrac{1}{3} + \\sum_{k=1}^\\infty 10^{-k!}.</math>\n\nIt can be shown that the nth root of \u03bb (a Liouville number) is a U-number of degree n.<ref>Baker(1979), p. 90.</ref>\n\nThis construction can be improved to create an uncountable family of U-numbers of degree ''n''. Let ''Z'' be the set consisting of every other power of 10 in the series above for \u03bb. The set of all subsets of ''Z'' is uncountable. Deleting any of the subsets of ''Z'' from the series for \u03bb creates uncountably many distinct Liouville numbers, whose nth roots are U-numbers of degree ''n''.\n\n===Type===\nThe [[supremum]] of the sequence {\u03c9(''x'',&nbsp;''n'')} is called the '''type'''. Almost all real numbers are S numbers of type 1, which is minimal for real S numbers. Almost all complex numbers are S numbers of type 1/2, which is also minimal. The claims of almost all numbers were conjectured by Mahler and in 1965 proved by Vladimir Sprindzhuk.<ref name=\"Baker, p. 86\"/>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Mathematics}}\n* [[Transcendental number theory]], the study of questions related to transcendental numbers\n* [[Diophantine approximation]]\n* [[Ring of periods|Periods]], a set of numbers (including both transcendental and algebraic numbers) which may be defined by integral equations.\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==References==\n* [[David Hilbert]], \"\u00dcber die Transcendenz der Zahlen ''e'' und <math>\\pi</math>\", ''Mathematische Annalen'' '''43''':216\u2013219 (1893).\n* [[Alexander Gelfond]], ''Transcendental and Algebraic Numbers'', Dover reprint (1960).\n* {{cite book | first=Alan | last=Baker | authorlink=Alan Baker (mathematician) | title=Transcendental Number Theory | publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] | year=1975 | isbn=978-0-521-20461-3 | zbl=0297.10013 }}\n* {{cite book | last=Mahler | first=Kurt | authorlink=Kurt Mahler | title=Lectures on Transcendental Numbers | series=Lecture Notes in Mathematics | volume=546 | publisher=[[Springer-Verlag]] | year=1976 | isbn=978-3-540-07986-6 | zbl=0332.10019 }}\n* {{cite book | zbl=0482.10047 | last=Sprindzhuk | first=Vladimir G.  | title=Metric theory of Diophantine approximations | others=Transl. from the Russian and ed. by Richard A.
