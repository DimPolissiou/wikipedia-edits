Downing worked as a cowhand at the nearby ranches. He was hired to work in the Esperanza Ranch, a ranch which was known for hiring rustlers, outlaws and renegade Apaches. Though Downing became known for his quarrelsome nature, he was also known to be less quarrelsome when he was drinking whiskey.<ref name=\"BD\"/><ref name=\"OL\"/><ref name=\"DEL\"/><ref name=\"BAG\"/>\n\n==The killing of  William S. \u201cSlim\u201d Traynor==\n[[File:Pearce-Ranch House-1896.jpg|200px|thumb|Ranch house in Pearce]][[File:Burt Alvord Arizona.jpg|200px|thumb|Constable Burt Alvord]]\nDowning and his wife moved to the town of [[Willcox, Arizona|Willcox]]. Downing spent most of his time hanging around saloons and associating with the members of a gang run by Albert R. \u201cBurt\u201d Alvord, who was the town constable when he wasn't working as a ranch-hand. However, there was a particular person whom Downing did not like and that was William S. \u201cSlim\u201d Traynor.<ref name=\"BD\"/><ref name=\"OL\"/><ref name=\"DEL\"/><ref name=\"BAG\"/>\n\nTraynor, who also went by the name of \"Bill Traynor\", was a native of [[Tennessee]] who at onetime had been an outlaw, mine guard and was a veteran [[Rough Rider]] campaigning in [[Cuba]] with [[Theodore Roosevelt]]. He was hired by cattle inspector Edwin Russell Hooker to look after his father, Henry Hooker, Sierra Bonita range interests. Traynor was engaged to be married to Mila Allaire, a young lady from a Willcox ranching family. He suspected Downing of stealing cattle and re-branding them. As such he made it known publicly that Downing was a rustler and that he was looking for him.<ref name=\"BD\"/><ref name=\"OL\"/><ref name=\"DEL\"/><ref name=\"BAG\"/>\n\nOn the evening of May 19, 1899, Traynor and his friend Henry C. Taylor, an off-duty bartender, walked into Tom Fulghum's \"Elite Saloon\" on the corner of Maley and Haskell Streets. Some witnesses say that Downing came in after Traynor, while others claim that Downing was already in the saloon.<ref name=\"BD\"/><ref name=\"OL\"/><ref name=\"DEL\"/><ref name=\"BAG\"/>\n\nWitnesses to the events that followed stated that when Downing walked in, Traynor dropped his right hand as if going for his gun. Four shots rang out from Bill Downing's pistol and Bill Traynor lay dead on the barroom floor; shot through the head and chest. Downing was arrested and during his trial he claimed the following: \"I accepted Taylor's invitation to take a cigar and as I answered, (Traynor) whirled around as though he went after his gun. As I stepped up to the bar, I was watching him on account of the threats he had made, and I looked outside. I thought it was a life-and-death matter and drew my gun and jerked Thomas Burts back so as not to shoot him and commenced shooting. I am not certain as to how many shots I fired.\u201d<ref name=\"BD\"/><ref name=\"OL\"/><ref name=\"DEL\"/><ref name=\"BAG\"/>\n\nConstable Alvord testified that he took the pistol and belt off the person of the deceased. He continued to state that he found the pistol loaded with five cartridges and one empty chamber. The pistol was in the scabbard when he took it off the deceased. No one took and checked Downing's gun. According to Constable Alvord, Traynor's body bore wounds from three bullets. One had torn through his breast and exited his shoulder; the other two had penetrated his skull. The coroner's jury found that Downing was acting in self-defense and was justified.<ref name=\"BD\"/><ref name=\"OL\"/><ref name=\"DEL\"/><ref name=\"BAG\"/>\n\n==The Southern-Pacific Cochise Depot robbery==\n[[File:Willcox-Building-John H. Norton and Company Store -1880.jpg|200px|thumb|The Soto Brothers Mercantile store which originally was the John H. Norton and Company Store]][[File:Cochise-Cochise Southern Pacific Railroad Train Depot-1903.jpg|200px|thumb|The Cochise Southern Pacific Railroad Train Depot in 2019]]\nConstable [[Burt Alvord]] was hired by the town of Willcox to police the boisterous cowboys in the area because of his reputation of being a bad man in [[Tombstone, Arizona|Tombstone]]. Alvord hired Bill Downing and [[Billy Stiles]] as deputies. Together with their new found legality they would be able to pursue their criminal careers without arousing the suspicion of the town folks. Among the members of the newly founded Alvord-Stiles Gang were local cowboys, such as Matt Burts, the Owen brothers and Jack Dunlap.<ref name=\"BSG\"/><ref name=\"BD\"/><ref name=\"OL\"/><ref name=\"DEL\"/><ref name=\"BAG\"/>\n\nThey conspired to hold up the Southern Pacific's westbound No. 10 train that stopped at Cochise Station at [[Cochise, Arizona|Cochise Junction]]. In order to carry out their mission Downing burglarized the Soto Brothers Mercantile store in Willcox where they pilfered dynamite. Then, Downing and the gang burglarized a mining camp in Dos Cabezas, where they stole additional dynamite, plus explosive caps and fuse.<ref name=\"BSG\"/><ref name=\"BD\"/><ref name=\"OL\"/><ref name=\"DEL\"/><ref name=\"BAG\"/>\n\nThe date set for the robbery was September 9, 1899. It was Downing's responsibility to tend to the horses. Stiles and Burts were to stop the train at Cochise Station and proceed with the robbery. They  held at gun point the engineer, the fireman, the mail clerk and a Wells Fargo man. The safe inside the express car was blown up. Their first heist was successful and they seized between $2,000 and $3,000 in cash and jewelry.<ref name=\"BSG\"/><ref name=\"BD\"/><ref name=\"OL\"/><ref name=\"DEL\"/><ref name=\"BAG\"/>\n\nConstable Alvord organized a posse when news of the robbery reached Willcox. He sent the posses in all directions except the right one. Downing, Burts and Stiles stashed everything in Burt Alvord's chicken house in Willcox and then they \"joined the posse.\" As expected the posse did not find anything. The stolen goods were removed from the chicken house and stashed in Bill Downing's ranch near Pearce. The only member of the gang that took his share was Matt Burts who headed to the state of [[Oregon]].<ref name=\"BSG\"/><ref name=\"BD\"/><ref name=\"OL\"/><ref name=\"DEL\"/><ref name=\"BAG\"/>\n\n==The failed Fairbank train robbery==\n[[File:Jeff_Milton_Arizona_Lawman.jpg|thumb|150px|Jeff Milton]][[File:Fairbank Railroad Depot Arizona Circa 1900.jpg|thumb|200px|The railroad depot in Fairbank, c. 1900.]][[File:T-Courthouse.jpg|thumb|200px|The Tombstone Courthouse]]\nOn February 15, 1900, the Alvord-Stiles Gang attempted a second major robbery, this time in [[Fairbank, Arizona]]. The members of the gang who participated in the holdup of the New Mexico & Arizona's northbound No. 1 on the Nogales-to-Benson line, were [[Jack Dunlop|Jesse \u201cThree-Fingered Jack\u201d Dunlap]], Tom \u201cBravo Juan\u201d Yoas, Robert Brown, and George and Lewis Owings. However, they were unaware that [[Jeff Milton]] a [[Wells Fargo|Wells Fargo Express]] messenger was aboard the train that day. Milton, an ex-Texas Ranger, had a long career in law enforcement.<ref name=\"BSG\"/><ref name=\"BD\"/><ref name=\"OL\"/><ref name=\"DEL\"/><ref name=\"BAG\"/>\n\nThe gang's attempt to rob the train failed because of Milton's intervention. He fired his gun and shot Jack Dunlap despite the fact that he himself was wounded with a bullet on his left arm between the shoulder and elbow which shattered the bone and left his arm useless. The gang fled the scene and left Dunlap behind. When a posse from Tombstone arrived and found Dunlap, he decided to cooperate and told them the names of those involved in the attempted but failed robbery. Dunlap died shortly after the encounter, but not before implicating Burt Alvord, Billy Stiles and Bill Downing as the planners of the robbery.<ref name=\"BSG\"/><ref name=\"BD\"/><ref name=\"OL\"/><ref name=\"DEL\"/><ref name=\"BAG\"/>\n\nBill Downing and some members of the gang were arrested and sent to the jail in Tombstone, since he had been implicated in the earlier Southern-Pacific Cochise Depot holdup. At the time, train robbery was a capital offense in the Arizona Territory. Downing's trial was set for December 10, 1900, in the Tombstone Courthouse in what is officially known as \"Territory of Arizona vs. W.F. Downing, case No. 745A\". On April 7, 1900, Stiles went to Tombstone and went to the jailhouse. He shot [[United States Marshals Service|Deputy Marshal]] George Bravin in the foot, and freed the gang members who were in the jail, with the exception of Downing. During the trail some of the members of the Alvord gang turned against Downing and testified against him. Stiles and Matt Burts were among those who testified for the prosecution. However, the majority of the jurors believed that capital punishment is not justified in cases where no lives were lost. Jury foreman L.A. Smith announced before Judge [[George Russell Davis]] that even though the jurors believed that Downing was guilty of train robbery, they refused to return a guilty verdict.<ref name=\"BSG\"/><ref name=\"BD\"/><ref name=\"OL\"/><ref name=\"DEL\"/><ref name=\"BAG\"/><ref name=\"legendsofamerica.com1\">{{Cite web | title=Burton Alvord - Lawmen Turned Outlaw| url=http://www.legendsofamerica.com/we-burtonalvord.html| access-date=June 30, 2012}}</ref>\n\nEven though Downing was acquitted in the robbery case, he was found guilty of interfering with the United States mail, a federal charge and was sentenced to 10 years of prison-time to be served in the Yuma Territorial Prison.<ref name=\"BSG\"/><ref name=\"BD\"/><ref name=\"OL\"/><ref name=\"DEL\"/><ref name=\"BAG\"/>\n\n==Yuma Territorial Prison==\n[[File:Yuma-Yuma Territorial Prison-1875-8-2.jpg|200px|thumb|Yuma Territorial Prison cell with steel bunkers]]\nThe [[Yuma Territorial Prison]] was a prison built by prisoners in 1875. The prison opened while Arizona was still a U.S. territory. Conditions in the prison were harsh. Some prisoners had to sleep in steel bunkbeds. Downing was assigned a number, inmate number 1733, just like any other prisoner. On April 11, 1901, he entered the Yuma prison through the [[sally port]] which is a secure, controlled entryway to the prison.<ref name=\"BD\"/><ref name=\"OL\"/><ref name=\"DEL\"/><ref name=\"BAG\"/>\n\nDowning's leg became infected and swollen while he was in prison. This was a result of the gunshot injuries he received during a gun battle while riding with the Sam Bass gang back in Texas. The penitentiary physician, Dr. James A. Ketcherside treated the old wound. The doctor suggested that the leg be amputated, but Downings refused to accept the request.<ref name=\"BD\"/><ref name=\"OL\"/><ref name=\"DEL\"/><ref name=\"BAG\"/>\n\nMrs. Downing was an attractive lady who was in poor health. While her husband was incarcerated, she sold their property in Willcox and used the money to try to gain her husband's freedom from the prison in Yuma. Mrs Downing eventually found herself alone and in need of money. She was hired to work in the home of A.F. Franklin in [[Tucson, Arizona|Tucson]]. On April 17, 1902, she was hired as a domestic servant by Tucson civic leader and entrepreneur John Ivancovich. A day later, shortly before her husband's release from prison, she was found dead in the servant's quarters. A coroner's jury determined that she had died of heart failure and attributed it to worry and nervousness brought on by the conviction and sentence of her husband. Mrs. Downing was buried in the Old City Cemetery in Willcox a.k.a. Willcox Pioneer Cemetery.<ref name=\"BD\"/><ref name=\"OL\"/><ref name=\"DEL\"/><ref name=\"BAG\"/><ref name=\"OCC\">{{cite web|url=http://files.usgwarchives.net/az/cochise/cemeteries/wilcoxhiscem.txt|website=files.usgwarchives.net|title=Old City Cemetery|accessdate=September 18, 2019}}</ref>\n\nDowning served a total of seven years in prison and was finally released for good behavior. According to Thomas H. Rynning, the Yuma prison warden, Downing had been a model prisoner.<ref name=\"BD\"/><ref name=\"OL\"/><ref name=\"DEL\"/><ref name=\"BAG\"/>\n\n==Downing's last stand==\n[[File:Willcox-Alley in Marley St.jpg|200px|thumb|An alley in Willcox]][[File:Willcox-Cemetery-Willcox Pioneer Cemetery-1880.jpg|200px|thumb|The Old City Cemetery where Bill Downing and his wife are buried]]\nDowning returned to Willcox upon his release from prison and opened a saloon which he named the Free and Easy Saloon on the corner of Maley Street. Willcox at the time had an ordinance which forbid gambling, prostitution and the serving of alcohol to women. Downing was known as a one to defy the law and he hired prostitutes who were highly skilled pickpockets.<ref name=\"AA\"/> Constable Bud Snow and Ranger Speed arrested Downing for serving women at the Free and Easy. Downing had encountered Arizona Ranger William Slaughter \u201cBilly\u201d Speed before. Speed was among the jurors who acquitted Downing in the 1899, killing of William S. \u201cSlim\u201d Traynor. Despite that they became bitter enemies. Downing pleaded guilty and paid a fifty dollar fine. The very next day he was arrested again, this time he was charged with assaulting a barber. Again he pleaded guilty and paid a fine of ten dollars.<ref name=\"BD\"/><ref name=\"OL\"/><ref name=\"DEL\"/><ref name=\"BAG\"/>\n\nThe citizen's of Willcox became tired of Downing's defiance of the law and sent a citizens petition to Harry C. Wheeler, the Captain of the Arizona Rangers, requesting protection from the  \u201cdrunk and unruly\u201d saloon-keeper. Wheeler received word that Downing had threaten to kill any officer who interfered with him. Thus, Wheeler ordered his men to kill Downing without any hesitation.<ref name=\"BD\"/><ref name=\"OL\"/><ref name=\"DEL\"/><ref name=\"BAG\"/>\n\nDowning had some problems with Cuco Leal, a prostitute who lived in his saloon. He went to the office of Constable Snow to complain and to ask the she be removed from his saloon. At the same time he also warned that if Ranger Speed ever stuck his head inside of the door of his saloon, he would shoot it off. He also stated that he will kill Speed when the time is right.<ref name=\"BD\"/><ref name=\"OL\"/><ref name=\"DEL\"/><ref name=\"BAG\"/>\n\nThe following day a saloon customer complained that someone had stolen some of his money. Downing jumped to the conclusion that it was Cuco Leal. He confronted and beat her. She then ran into the Ranchman's Corral Saloon, whose owner was George McKittrick, a rival of Downing. McKittrick told Leal to stay in his saloon and to stay clear of the \"Free and Easy\" saloon. McKittrick then went to town Justice Page and told him about the Downing-Leal situation. Page issued a warrant for Downing's arrest and handed the warrant to Constable Bud Snow. The constable went to Ranger Speed's house and asked him to join him in presenting the warrant. Speed agreed and recommended that they act in the following morning.<ref name=\"BD\"/><ref name=\"OL\"/><ref name=\"DEL\"/><ref name=\"BAG\"/>\n\nThe following morning Downing was in his saloon drinking whiskey. He decided that he would show up in Judge Page's office to discuss the Leal situation. He got up to go and at the same time left his gun behind. When he stepped out the door he noticed that Constable Snow was heading towards the saloon and he ran back inside. He did not notice that Ranger Speed was accompanying the constable. Once they reached the saloon, Constable Snow told Speed to guard the back door of the saloon which was located by an alley. Ranger Speed loaded his .30-40 Winchester and headed towards the alley door.<ref name=\"BD\"/><ref name=\"OL\"/><ref name=\"DEL\"/><ref name=\"BAG\"/>\n\nDowning thought that the constable would come in through the front door and decided to leave the saloon through the back exit. When he went out to the alley he came face-to-face with Ranger Speed. The Ranger ordered him to surrender but, Downing made a gesture as to reach for his gun, forgetting that he had left his weapon in the saloon. The Ranger then raised his Winchester and fired. The bullet from Speed's rifle entered through his right breast, punctured his right lung and exited beneath his right shoulder blade. Downing died immediately.<ref name=\"BD\"/><ref name=\"OL\"/><ref name=\"DEL\"/><ref name=\"BAG\"/>\n\nArizona Ranger Captain Wheeler made the following remark to the community's reaction to Downing's demise: \u201cThis is the first time I have known a dead man to be without a single friend and the first time that I have known a killing to meet absolute general rejoicing in all this town and precinct.\u201d Downing was buried in an unmarked grave in the Old City Cemetery of Willcox a.k.a. Willcox Pioneer Cemetery.<ref name=\"BD\"/><ref name=\"OL\"/><ref name=\"DEL\"/><ref name=\"BAG\"/><ref name=\"OCC\"/>\n\nThe coroner's jury found that the shot fired by Ranger Speed was in the performance of his duty as an officer and that he was perfectly justified in the act, and, therefore, he was exonerated from all blame in the matter.<ref name=\"BD\"/><ref name=\"OL\"/><ref name=\"DEL\"/><ref name=\"BAG\"/>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Arizona|Biography}}\n*[[List of historic properties in Willcox, Arizona]]\n===Arizona pioneers===\n*[[Henry Garfias]]\n*[[Joe Mayer]]\n*[[William John Murphy]]\n*[[Levi Ruggles]]\n*[[Trinidad Swilling]]\n*[[Ora Rush Weed]]\n*[[Henry Wickenburg]]\n*[[Sedona Schnebly]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*\"Arizoniana: Stories from Old Arizona\"; by: Marshall Trimble; Publisher: Primer Pub; {{ISBN|188559089X}}; {{ISBN|978-1885590893}}\n*\"Arizona Outlaws and Lawmen: Gunslingers, Bandits, Heroes and Peacekeepers\"; by: Marshall Trimble; Publisher: The History Press; ASIN: B00XZPQM2W\n\n{{Clear}}\n{{Wild West}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Downing, Bill}}\n[[Category:1860 births]]\n[[Category:1908 deaths]]\n[[Category:Lawmen of the American Old West]]\n[[Category:Arizona folklore]]\n[[Category:Gunslingers of the American Old West]]\n[[Category:Arizona pioneers]]\n[[Category:Outlaws of the American Old West]]\n[[Category:Cowboys]]\n[[Category:American outlaws]]\n[[Category:People of the American Old West]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|American Wild West outlaw}}\n{{Infobox person\n| name                      = Bill Downing \n| image                     = Bill Downing.jpg\n| image_size                = 200px\n| caption                   =  William \"Bill\" Downing\n| birth_name                = Allegedly: Frank Jackson\n| birth_date                = 1860\n| birth_place               = [[Texas]]\n| death_date                =August 5, 1908\n| death_place               = [[Willcox, Arizona]]\n| resting_place             = Old City Cemetery in Willcox, Az\n| nationality               = American\n| other_names               = William F.

Some witnesses say that Downing came in after Traynor, while others claim that Downing was already in the saloon.<ref name=\"BD\"/><ref name=\"OL\"/><ref name=\"DEL\"/><ref name=\"BAG\"/>\n\nWitnesses to the events that followed stated that when Downing walked in, Traynor dropped his right hand as if going for his gun. Four shots rang out from Bill Downing's pistol and Bill Traynor lay dead on the barroom floor; shot through the head and chest. Downing was arrested and during his trial he claimed the following: \"I accepted Taylor's invitation to take a cigar and as I answered, (Traynor) whirled around as though he went after his gun. As I stepped up to the bar, I was watching him on account of the threats he had made, and I looked outside. I thought it was a life-and-death matter and drew my gun and jerked Thomas Burts back so as not to shoot him and commenced shooting. I am not certain as to how many shots I fired.\u201d<ref name=\"BD\"/><ref name=\"OL\"/><ref name=\"DEL\"/><ref name=\"BAG\"/>\n\nConstable Alvord testified that he took the pistol and belt off the person of the deceased. He continued to state that he found the pistol loaded with five cartridges and one empty chamber. The pistol was in the scabbard when he took it off the deceased. No one took and checked Downing's gun. According to Constable Alvord, Traynor's body bore wounds from three bullets. One had torn through his breast and exited his shoulder; the other two had penetrated his skull. The coroner's jury found that Downing was acting in self-defense and was justified.<ref name=\"BD\"/><ref name=\"OL\"/><ref name=\"DEL\"/><ref name=\"BAG\"/>\n\n==The Southern-Pacific Cochise Depot robbery==\n[[File:Willcox-Building-John H.

Norton and Company Store]][[File:Cochise-Cochise Southern Pacific Railroad Train Depot-1903.jpg|200px|thumb|The Cochise Southern Pacific Railroad Train Depot in 2019]]\nConstable [[Burt Alvord]] was hired by the town of Willcox to police the boisterous cowboys in the area because of his reputation of being a bad man in [[Tombstone, Arizona|Tombstone]]. Alvord hired Bill Downing and [[Billy Stiles]] as deputies. Together with their new found legality they would be able to pursue their criminal careers without arousing the suspicion of the town folks. Among the members of the newly founded Alvord-Stiles Gang were local cowboys, such as Matt Burts, the Owen brothers and Jack Dunlap.<ref name=\"BSG\"/><ref name=\"BD\"/><ref name=\"OL\"/><ref name=\"DEL\"/><ref name=\"BAG\"/>\n\nThey conspired to hold up the Southern Pacific's westbound No. 10 train that stopped at Cochise Station at [[Cochise, Arizona|Cochise Junction]]. In order to carry out their mission Downing burglarized the Soto Brothers Mercantile store in Willcox where they pilfered dynamite. Then, Downing and the gang burglarized a mining camp in Dos Cabezas, where they stole additional dynamite, plus explosive caps and fuse.<ref name=\"BSG\"/><ref name=\"BD\"/><ref name=\"OL\"/><ref name=\"DEL\"/><ref name=\"BAG\"/>\n\nThe date set for the robbery was September 9, 1899. It was Downing's responsibility to tend to the horses. Stiles and Burts were to stop the train at Cochise Station and proceed with the robbery. They  held at gun point the engineer, the fireman, the mail clerk and a Wells Fargo man. The safe inside the express car was blown up. Their first heist was successful and they seized between $2,000 and $3,000 in cash and jewelry.<ref name=\"BSG\"/><ref name=\"BD\"/><ref name=\"OL\"/><ref name=\"DEL\"/><ref name=\"BAG\"/>\n\nConstable Alvord organized a posse when news of the robbery reached Willcox. He sent the posses in all directions except the right one. Downing, Burts and Stiles stashed everything in Burt Alvord's chicken house in Willcox and then they \"joined the posse.\" As expected the posse did not find anything. The stolen goods were removed from the chicken house and stashed in Bill Downing's ranch near Pearce. The only member of the gang that took his share was Matt Burts who headed to the state of [[Oregon]].<ref name=\"BSG\"/><ref name=\"BD\"/><ref name=\"OL\"/><ref name=\"DEL\"/><ref name=\"BAG\"/>\n\n==The failed Fairbank train robbery==\n[[File:Jeff_Milton_Arizona_Lawman.jpg|thumb|150px|Jeff Milton]][[File:Fairbank Railroad Depot Arizona Circa 1900.jpg|thumb|200px|The railroad depot in Fairbank, c. 1900.]][[File:T-Courthouse.jpg|thumb|200px|The Tombstone Courthouse]]\nOn February 15, 1900, the Alvord-Stiles Gang attempted a second major robbery, this time in [[Fairbank, Arizona]]. The members of the gang who participated in the holdup of the New Mexico & Arizona's northbound No. 1 on the Nogales-to-Benson line, were [[Jack Dunlop|Jesse \u201cThree-Fingered Jack\u201d Dunlap]], Tom \u201cBravo Juan\u201d Yoas, Robert Brown, and George and Lewis Owings. However, they were unaware that [[Jeff Milton]] a [[Wells Fargo|Wells Fargo Express]] messenger was aboard the train that day. Milton, an ex-Texas Ranger, had a long career in law enforcement.<ref name=\"BSG\"/><ref name=\"BD\"/><ref name=\"OL\"/><ref name=\"DEL\"/><ref name=\"BAG\"/>\n\nThe gang's attempt to rob the train failed because of Milton's intervention. He fired his gun and shot Jack Dunlap despite the fact that he himself was wounded with a bullet on his left arm between the shoulder and elbow which shattered the bone and left his arm useless. The gang fled the scene and left Dunlap behind. When a posse from Tombstone arrived and found Dunlap, he decided to cooperate and told them the names of those involved in the attempted but failed robbery. Dunlap died shortly after the encounter, but not before implicating Burt Alvord, Billy Stiles and Bill Downing as the planners of the robbery.<ref name=\"BSG\"/><ref name=\"BD\"/><ref name=\"OL\"/><ref name=\"DEL\"/><ref name=\"BAG\"/>\n\nBill Downing and some members of the gang were arrested and sent to the jail in Tombstone, since he had been implicated in the earlier Southern-Pacific Cochise Depot holdup. At the time, train robbery was a capital offense in the Arizona Territory. Downing's trial was set for December 10, 1900, in the Tombstone Courthouse in what is officially known as \"Territory of Arizona vs. W.F. Downing, case No. 745A\". On April 7, 1900, Stiles went to Tombstone and went to the the jailhouse. He shot [[United States Marshals Service|Deputy Marshal]] George Bravin in the foot, and freed the gang members who were in the jail, with the exception of Downing. During the trail some of the members of the Alvord gang turned against Downing and testified against him. Stiles and Matt Burts were among those who testified for the prosecution. However, the majority of the jurors believed that capital punishment is not justified in cases where no lives were lost. Jury foreman L.A. Smith announced before Judge [[George Russell Davis]] that even though the jurors believed that Downing was guilty of train robbery, they refused to return a guilty verdict.<ref name=\"BSG\"/><ref name=\"BD\"/><ref name=\"OL\"/><ref name=\"DEL\"/><ref name=\"BAG\"/><ref name=\"legendsofamerica.com1\">{{Cite web | title=Burton Alvord - Lawmen Turned Outlaw| url=http://www.legendsofamerica.com/we-burtonalvord.html| access-date=June 30, 2012}}</ref>\n\nEven though Downing was acquitted in the robbery case, he was found guilty of interfering with the United States mail, a federal charge and was sentenced to 10 years of prison-time to be served in the Yuma Territorial Prison.<ref name=\"BSG\"/><ref name=\"BD\"/><ref name=\"OL\"/><ref name=\"DEL\"/><ref name=\"BAG\"/>\n\n==Yuma Territorial Prison==\n[[File:Yuma-Yuma Territorial Prison-1875-8-2.jpg|200px|thumb|Yuma Territorial Prison cell with steel bunkers]]\nThe [[Yuma Territorial Prison]] was a prison built by prisoners in 1875. The prison opened while Arizona was still a U.S. territory. Conditions in the prison were harsh. Some prisoners had to sleep in steel bunkbeds. Downing was assigned a number, inmate number 1733, just like any other prisoner. On April 11, 1901, he entered the Yuma prison through the [[sally port]] which is a secure, controlled entryway to the prison.<ref name=\"BD\"/><ref name=\"OL\"/><ref name=\"DEL\"/><ref name=\"BAG\"/>\n\nDowning's leg became infected and swollen while he was in prison. This was a result of the gunshot injuries he received during a gun battle while riding with the Sam Bass gang back in Texas. The penitentiary physician, Dr. James A. Ketcherside treated the old wound. The doctor suggested that the leg be amputated, but Downings refused to accept the request.<ref name=\"BD\"/><ref name=\"OL\"/><ref name=\"DEL\"/><ref name=\"BAG\"/>\n\nMrs. Downing was an attractive lady who was in poor health. While her husband was incarcerated, she sold their property in Willcox and used the money to try to gain her husband's freedom from the prison in Yuma. Mrs Downing eventually found herself alone and in need of money. She was hired to work in the home of A.F. Franklin in [[Tucson, Arizona|Tucson]]. On April 17, 1902, she was hired as a domestic servant by Tucson civic leader and entrepreneur John Ivancovich. A day later, shortly before her husband's release from prison, she was found dead in the servant's quarters. A coroner's jury determined that she had died of heart failure and attributed it to worry and nervousness brought on by the conviction and sentence of her husband. Mrs. Downing was buried in the Old City Cemetery in Willcox a.k.a. Willcox Pioneer Cemetery.<ref name=\"BD\"/><ref name=\"OL\"/><ref name=\"DEL\"/><ref name=\"BAG\"/><ref name=\"OCC\">{{cite web|url=http://files.usgwarchives.net/az/cochise/cemeteries/wilcoxhiscem.txt|website=files.usgwarchives.net|title=Old City Cemetery|accessdate=September 18, 2019}}</ref>\n\nDowning served a total of seven years in prison and was finally released for good behavior. According to Thomas H. Rynning, the Yuma prison warden, Downing had been a model prisoner.<ref name=\"BD\"/><ref name=\"OL\"/><ref name=\"DEL\"/><ref name=\"BAG\"/>\n\n==Downing's last stand==\n[[File:Willcox-Alley in Marley St.jpg|200px|thumb|An alley in Willcox]][[File:Willcox-Cemetery-Willcox Pioneer Cemetery-1880.jpg|200px|thumb|The Old City Cemetery where Bill Downing and his wife are buried]]\nDowning returned to Willcox upon his release from prison and opened a saloon which he named the Free and Easy Saloon on the corner of Maley Street. Willcox at the time had an ordinance which forbid gambling, prostitution and the serving of alcohol to women. Downing was known as a one to defy the law and he hired prostitutes who were highly skilled pickpockets.<ref name=\"AA\"/> Constable Bud Snow and Ranger Speed arrested Downing for serving women at the Free and Easy. Downing had encountered Arizona Ranger William Slaughter \u201cBilly\u201d Speed before. Speed was among the jurors who acquitted Downing in the 1899, killing of William S. \u201cSlim\u201d Traynor. Despite that they became bitter enemies. Downing pleaded guilty and paid a fifty dollar fine. The very next day he was arrested again, this time he was charged with assaulting a barber. Again he pleaded guilty and paid a fine of ten dollars.<ref name=\"BD\"/><ref name=\"OL\"/><ref name=\"DEL\"/><ref name=\"BAG\"/>\n\nThe citizen's of Willcox became tired of Downing's defiance of the law and sent a citizens petition to Harry C. Wheeler, the Captain of the Arizona Rangers, requesting protection from the  \u201cdrunk and unruly\u201d saloon-keeper. Wheeler received word that Downing had threaten to kill any officer who interfered with him. Thus, Wheeler ordered his men to kill Downing without any hesitation.<ref name=\"BD\"/><ref name=\"OL\"/><ref name=\"DEL\"/><ref name=\"BAG\"/>\n\nDowning had some problems with Cuco Leal, a prostitute who lived in his saloon. He went to the office of Constable Snow to complain and to ask the she be removed from his saloon. At the same time he also warned that if Ranger Speed ever stuck his head inside of the door of his saloon, he would shoot it off. He also stated that he will kill Speed when the time is right.<ref name=\"BD\"/><ref name=\"OL\"/><ref name=\"DEL\"/><ref name=\"BAG\"/>\n\nThe following day a saloon customer complained that someone had stolen some of his money. Downing jumped to the conclusion that it was Cuco Leal. He confronted and beat her. She then ran into the Ranchman's Corral Saloon, whose owner was George McKittrick, a rival of Downing. McKittrick told Leal to stay in his saloon and to stay clear of the \"Free and Easy\" saloon. McKittrick then went to town Justice Page and told him about the Downing-Leal situation. Page issued a warrant for Downing's arrest and handed the warrant to Constable Bud Snow. The constable went to Ranger Speed's house and asked him to join him in presenting the warrant. Speed agreed and recommended that they act in the following morning.<ref name=\"BD\"/><ref name=\"OL\"/><ref name=\"DEL\"/><ref name=\"BAG\"/>\n\nThe following morning Downing was in his saloon drinking whiskey. He decided that he would show up in Judge Page's office to discuss the Leal situation. He got up to go and at the same time left his gun behind. When he stepped out the door he noticed that Constable Snow was heading towards the saloon and he ran back inside. He did not notice that Ranger Speed was accompanying the constable. Once they reached the saloon, Constable Snow told Speed to guard the back door of the saloon which was located by an alley. Ranger Speed loaded his .30-40 Winchester and headed towards the alley door.<ref name=\"BD\"/><ref name=\"OL\"/><ref name=\"DEL\"/><ref name=\"BAG\"/>\n\nDowning thought that the constable would come in through the front door and decided to leave the saloon through the back exit. When he went out to the alley he came face-to-face with Ranger Speed. The Ranger ordered him to surrender but, Downing made a gesture as to reach for his gun, forgetting that he had left his weapon in the saloon. The Ranger then raised his Winchester and fired. The bullet from Speed's rifle entered through his right breast, punctured his right lung and exited beneath his right shoulder blade. Downing died immediately.<ref name=\"BD\"/><ref name=\"OL\"/><ref name=\"DEL\"/><ref name=\"BAG\"/>\n\nArizona Ranger Captain Wheeler made the following remark to the community's reaction to Downing's demise: \u201cThis is the first time I have known a dead man to be without a single friend and the first time that I have known a killing to meet absolute general rejoicing in all this town and precinct.\u201d Downing was buried in an unmarked grave in the Old City Cemetery of Willcox a.k.a. Willcox Pioneer Cemetery.<ref name=\"BD\"/><ref name=\"OL\"/><ref name=\"DEL\"/><ref name=\"BAG\"/><ref name=\"OCC\"/>\n\nThe coroner's jury found that the shot fired by Ranger Speed was in the performance of his duty as an officer and that he was perfectly justified in the act, and, therefore, he was exonerated from all blame in the matter.<ref name=\"BD\"/><ref name=\"OL\"/><ref name=\"DEL\"/><ref name=\"BAG\"/>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Arizona|Biography}}\n*[[List of historic properties in Willcox, Arizona]]\n===Arizona pioneers===\n*[[Henry Garfias]]\n*[[Joe Mayer]]\n*[[William John Murphy]]\n*[[Levi Ruggles]]\n*[[Trinidad Swilling]]\n*[[Ora Rush Weed]]\n*[[Henry Wickenburg]]\n*[[Sedona Schnebly]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*\"Arizoniana: Stories from Old Arizona\"; by: Marshall Trimble; Publisher: Primer Pub; {{ISBN|188559089X}}; {{ISBN|978-1885590893}}\n*\"Arizona Outlaws and Lawmen: Gunslingers, Bandits, Heroes and Peacekeepers\"; by: Marshall Trimble; Publisher: The History Press; ASIN: B00XZPQM2W\n\n{{Clear}}\n{{Wild West}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Downing, Bill}}\n[[Category:1860 births]]\n[[Category:1908 deaths]]\n[[Category:Lawmen of the American Old West]]\n[[Category:Arizona folklore]]\n[[Category:Gunslingers of the American Old West]]\n[[Category:Arizona pioneers]]\n[[Category:Outlaws of the American Old West]]\n[[Category:Cowboys]]\n[[Category:American outlaws]]\n[[Category:People of the American Old West]]\n", "name_user": "Arjayay", "label": "safe", "comment": "Duplicate word removed", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Downing"}

Their language became even more [[idiosyncratic]] at this time. Soon it was unintelligible to others.

They created many plays and stories in a sort of soap opera style, reading some of them aloud on tape as gifts for their sister, Rose. Inspired by a pair of gift diaries on Christmas 1979, they began their writing careers. They sent away for a [[mail order]] course in creative writing, and each kept an extensive diary and wrote a number of stories, poems and novels.<ref name=\"newyorker\" /> Set primarily in the United States and particularly in [[Malibu, California]], the stories involve young men and women who exhibit strange and often criminal behaviour.<ref name=\"wallace\" />{{Page needed|date=April 2019}} \n\nJune wrote a novel titled ''Pepsi-Cola Addict'', in which the high-school hero is seduced by a teacher, then sent away to a [[reformatory]] where a homosexual guard makes a play for him.<ref>{{Cite news |last=de Angelis |first=April |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2007/jun/28/fiction.classicalmusicandopera |title=April de Angelis on troubled twins Jennifer and June Gibbons |date=28 June 2007 |work=[[The Guardian]] |access-date=19 July 2013 |publisher=[[Guardian Media Group|GMG]] |location=London |issn=0261-3077 |oclc=60623878 |author-link=April De Angelis}}</ref> The two girls pooled together their [[unemployment benefits]] in order to get the novel published by a [[self-publishing press|vanity press]].<ref name=\"people\">{{Cite web |url=https://people.com/archive/a-british-journalist-unravels-the-tale-of-the-twins-who-wouldnt-talk-vol-26-no-17/ |title=A British Journalist Unravels the Tale of the Twins Who Wouldn't Talk |last=Shapiro |first=Harriet |date=27 October 1986 |website=People |language=en |access-date=29 April 2019}}</ref> Their other attempts to publish novels and stories were unsuccessful.

Both women were admitted to [[Broadmoor Hospital]] where they were held for eleven years.\n\n== Childhood ==\nJune and Jennifer were the daughters of Caribbean immigrants Gloria and Aubrey Gibbons.

Their language became even more [[idiosyncratic]] at this time. Soon it was unintelligible to others. Their language, or [[idioglossia]], qualified as an example of [[cryptophasia]], exemplified by the twins' simultaneous actions, which often mirrored each other.

They created many plays and stories in a sort of soap opera style, reading some of them aloud on tape as gifts for their sister, Rose. Inspired by a pair of gift diaries on Christmas 1979, they began their writing careers. They sent away for a [[mail order]] course in creative writing, and each kept an extensive diary and wrote a number of stories, poems and novels.<ref name=\"newyorker\" /> Set primarily in the United States and particularly in [[Malibu, California]], the stories involve young men and women who exhibit strange and often criminal behaviour.<ref name=\"wallace\" />{{Page needed|date=April 2019}} \n\nJune wrote a novel titled ''Pepsi-Cola Addict'', in which the high-school hero is seduced by a teacher, then sent away to a [[reformatory]] where a homosexual guard makes a play for him.<ref>{{Cite news |last=de Angelis |first=April |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2007/jun/28/fiction.classicalmusicandopera |title=April de Angelis on troubled twins Jennifer and June Gibbons |date=28 June 2007 |work=[[The Guardian]] |access-date=19 July 2013 |publisher=[[Guardian Media Group|GMG]] |location=London |issn=0261-3077 |oclc=60623878 |author-link=April De Angelis}}</ref> The two girls pooled together their [[unemployment benefits]] in order to get the novel published by a [[self-publishing press|vanity press]].<ref name=\"people\">{{Cite web |url=https://people.com/archive/a-british-journalist-unravels-the-tale-of-the-twins-who-wouldnt-talk-vol-26-no-17/ |title=A British Journalist Unravels the Tale of the Twins Who Wouldn't Talk |last=Shapiro |first=Harriet |date=27 October 1986 |website=People |language=en |access-date=29 April 2019}}</ref> Their other attempts to publish novels and stories were unsuccessful.

June Gibbons is considered to be an outsider writer.\n\n==Hospitalisation==\nIn their later teenage years, the twins began experimenting with drugs and alcohol.<ref name=\"Evans\" /> In 1981, the girls committed a number of crimes including [[vandalism]], petty [[theft]] and [[arson]], which led to their being admitted to [[Broadmoor Hospital]], a high-security mental health hospital.

Its aim was to build bridges between professional and nonprofessional educators and between those of differing religious commitments. The next year participation had doubled and all aspects of Jewish learning were covered.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://limmud.org/inside-limmud/about-limmud/history/|title=History|website=Limmud|language=en-GB|access-date=2019-08-06}}</ref>\n\nBy 1996 the main Limmud conference had expanded and moved to Oxford with attendance of over 1,000, 250 sessions and 140 speakers, becoming the largest Jewish conference in Europle. During this period the organisation also held smaller one day events in Glasgow and Leeds.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nIn 1999 the first non-UK Limmud was held in [[Sydney]], [[Australia]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n2006 saw Limmud appoint its first full-time Executive Director, [[Raymond Simonson]]. Prior to this Limmud had been run by part-time directors.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe late 2000s saw Limmud participation in the UK grow dramatically. In 2007 Limmud held their conference at Warwick University, with 2,000 participants and 600 at Limmud Fest, a smaller summer festival. With numbers more than doubling in 2008 to 7,000 for their UK events. International conferences were now held in [[Cape Town]], [[Johannesburg]], [[Hungary]], [[Atlanta]], [[Buenos Aires]], [[Bulgaria]], [[Los Angeles]], [[Philadelphia]], [[Poland]], [[Stockholm]], [[Ukraine]], [[Germany]], [[Turkey]], [[Toronto]], [[New York City|New York]] and [[France]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nLimmud Conference moved to [[Birmingham]] for Conference 2015, with a record 2,800 participants. New Limmud groups include [[Arizona]], [[Mar del Plata]], [[Australia]], [[Tel Aviv]], [[Chile]] and [[Essen]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nIn 2018 Limmud Conference became Limmud Festival. Limmud set up affiliates in [[North America]] and [[Israel]]. Limmud estimates there are 40,000 participants annually in a Limmud worldwide, run by 4,000 volunteers. In 2017 Limmud was also awarded the [[Jerusalem Unity Prize]] for contribution to Jewish life, presented by Israeli President Rivlin.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==Organisation==\nLimmud is a company and a charity. It is run by a board of directors and trustees, all of whom are volunteers. Initially, there was no difference between Limmud the organisation and Limmud Conference, the annual event, so the chairs of the Conference/Festival team were the chairs of the organisation. In 1990, a chair for the organisation who was separate from the Conference chairs was appointed for the first time. In 2006, [[Limmud International]] was created, as a separate unit within Limmud to manage relationships with other Limmud groups around the world. Limmud International was absorbed back into Limmud at the end of 2016.\n\n'''Chairs of Limmud Conference/Festival'''\n\n1980\u20131981 Alistair Falk, Michael May, Jonathan Benjamin, Clive Lawton\n\n1982\u20131984 Steve Miller\n\n1985 Tina Elliott\n\n1986 Jonathan Benjamin\n\n1987 Alan Wilkinson\n\n1988 Madeline Ismach\n\n1989 Alistair Falk\n\n1990\u20131994 Andrew Gilbert\n\n1995 Natan Tiefenbrun\n\n1996 Yvonne Krasner, Marc Soloway, Judy Trotter\n\n1997 Micah Gold, Jonny Persey, Marc Soloway\n\n1998 Micah Gold\n\n1999 Jacqueline Nicholls, Claire Straus\n\n2000 Andrew Levy, Abe Sterne\n\n2001 Claire Mandel, Carolyn Bogush\n\n2002 Juliet Simmons\n\n2003 Fleurise Luder, Eliot Kaye\n\n2004 Batya Elliott, Paul Turner\n\n2005 David Century, Shoshana Bloom\n\n2006 Jason Caplin, Natalie Grazin\n\n2007 Kevin Sefton\n\n2008 Libby Burkeman and Charles Darwish\n\n2009 Rebecca Lester and David Israel\n\n2010 Danielle Nagler and Steven Fisher\n\n2011 Shoshana Bloom and Jonathan Walters\n\n2012 David Renton\n\n2013 Oliver Marcus and Richard Verber\n\n2014 Shana Boltin and Jonathan Robinson\n\n2015 Joanna Ish-Horowicz, Michael Gladstone and Claire Samuel\n\n2016 Benjamin Crowne and Steven Weller\n\n2017 Abigail Jacobi and Anna Lawton\n\n2018 Jonathan Robinson\n\n2019 Ben Lewis, Hannah Brady and Dan Heller\n\n2020 Elliot Jebreel and Robert Simmons\n\n'''Chairs of Limmud'''\n\n1990\u20131997 Andrew Gilbert\n\n1998\u20132001 Judy Trotter\n\n1998\u20132000 Natan Tiefenbrun\n\n2001\u20132003 Claire Straus\n\n2003\u20132005 Claire Mandel\n\n2006\u20132009 Elliott Goldstein\n\n2010\u20132012 Carolyn Bogush\n\n2013\u20132015 Kevin Sefton\n\n2016\u20132019 David Hoffman\n\n2019\u2013  Shoshana Bloom\n\n'''Chairs of Limmud International'''\n\n2006\u20132009 Andrew Gilbert\n\n2010\u20132012 Uri Berkowitz, Helena Miller\n\n2013\u20132014 David Hoffman\n\n2015\u20132016 David Bilchitz<ref>{{Cite book|title=Limmud Conference / Festival handbooks|last=|first=|publisher=|year=2002\u20132017|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref>\n\n'''Chair of Limmud North America'''\n\n2017\u20132019 Shep Rosenman<ref>{{Cite book|title=Limmud Conference / Festival handbooks|last=|first=|publisher=|year=2002\u20132018|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref>\n\n2019\u2013 Faye Rosenberg-Cohen, Sivie Twersky\n\n'''Chair of Limmud Israel'''\n\n2018\u2013 Danielle Nagler<ref name=\"Nagler\">{{cite news | url=https://www.timesofisrael.com/spotlight/times-of-israel-presents-limmud-israel-tel-aviv-after-dark-on-oct-22/ | title=Times of Israel Presents: Limmud Israel \u2014 Tel Aviv After Dark, on Oct. 22 | work=[[The Times of Israel]] | date=15 October 2018 | accessdate=30 November 2018 | author=TOI Staff}}</ref>\n\nLimmud's first professional appointment in 1998 was of [[Clive Lawton]] as part-time Executive Director; he gradually became backed by a full-time administrator.

In 2017 Limmud was also awarded the [[Jerusalem Unity Prize]] for contribution to Jewish life, presented by Israeli President Rivlin.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==Organisation==\nLimmud is a company and a charity. It is run by a board of directors and trustees, all of whom are volunteers. Initially, there was no difference between Limmud the organisation and Limmud Conference, the annual event, so the chairs of the Conference/Festival team were the chairs of the organisation. In 1990, a chair for the organisation who was separate from the Conference chairs was appointed for the first time. In 2006, [[Limmud International]] was created, as a separate unit within Limmud to manage relationships with other Limmud groups around the world.

The station is located in [[Changi]], [[Singapore]], within [[Singapore Changi Airport]], and is built in an East-West direction with the two ends of the station connecting directly to Changi Airport Terminals 2 and 3. It is also one of the few stations, where faregates are on the same level as the platforms. As the only MRT Station to serve the Changi planning area, it is currently the easternmost MRT station in Singapore until the opening of the [[Aviation Park MRT station]] in 2029.\n\nDuring the construction of Terminal 3, ideas have been put forth to build a new branch line connecting to and around the airport. The current two-station branch line was finalised in 1996 and construction started on 1999. The station opened on 8 February 2002, with passenger demand lower than expected. Nevertheless, it has provided a new transport option to the airport. On 25 May 2019, it was announced that the station will be incorporated as part of the [[Thomson\u2013East Coast MRT line|Thomson\u2013East Coast line]], connecting to Changi Airport Terminal 5 by 2040.<ref name=\"LTMP 2040\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.todayonline.com/singapore/new-mrt-stations-tel-extension-and-possible-new-rail-line-lta-2040-blueprint|title=New MRT stations, line extensions and a possible new rail line: LTA's 2040 blueprint|website=TODAYonline|access-date=2019-05-25}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.lta.gov.sg/apps/news/page.aspx?c=2&id=de83f659-4b0d-4609-840e-3deb3ac9b4b9|title=Land Transport Master Plan 2040: Bringing Singapore Together {{!}} Press Room {{!}} Land Transport Authority|website=www.lta.gov.sg|access-date=2019-05-26}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n===Planning===\n[[File:Changi MRT.JPG|left|thumb|Changi Airport MRT station, featuring flight information box in addition to train route information]]\n[[File:CG1 changi airport faregates.jpg|left|thumb|Changi Airport is one of the few stations where faregates are on the same level as the platforms.]]\nBefore the MRT line, Changi Airport had been operating with no [[Airport rail link|rail link]] and with full reliance on [[Taxicabs of Singapore|taxi]] and [[Bus transport in Singapore|bus connections]] since the airport began operations in 1981. This has proven effective given the short 20 kilometre distance to the city via the [[East Coast Parkway]] and affordability of taxis and buses. Public buses instead link commuters to nearby MRT stations at [[Bedok MRT station|Bedok]], [[Tampines MRT station|Tampines]] and [[Pasir Ris MRT station|Pasir Ris]].

The station is located in [[Changi]], [[Singapore]], within [[Singapore Changi Airport]], and is built in an East-West direction with the two ends of the station connecting directly to Changi Airport Terminals 2 and 3. It is also one of the few stations, where faregates are on the same level as the platforms. As the only MRT Station to serve the Changi planning area, it is currently the easternmost MRT station in Singapore until the opening of the [[Aviation Park MRT station]] in 2029.\n\nDuring the construction of Terminal 3, ideas have been put forth to build a new branch line connecting to and around the airport. The current two-station branch line was finalised in 1996 and construction started on 1999. The station opened on 8 February 2002, with passenger demand lower than expected. Nevertheless, it has provided a new transport option to the airport. On 25 May 2019, it was announced that the station will be incorporated as part of the [[Thomson\u2013East Coast MRT line|Thomson\u2013East Coast line]], connecting to Changi Airport Terminal 5 by 2040.<ref name=\"LTMP 2040\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.todayonline.com/singapore/new-mrt-stations-tel-extension-and-possible-new-rail-line-lta-2040-blueprint|title=New MRT stations, line extensions and a possible new rail line: LTA's 2040 blueprint|website=TODAYonline|access-date=2019-05-25}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.lta.gov.sg/apps/news/page.aspx?c=2&id=de83f659-4b0d-4609-840e-3deb3ac9b4b9|title=Land Transport Master Plan 2040: Bringing Singapore Together {{!}} Press Room {{!}} Land Transport Authority|website=www.lta.gov.sg|access-date=2019-05-26}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n===Planning===\n[[File:Changi MRT.JPG|left|thumb|Changi Airport MRT station, featuring flight information box in addition to train route information]]\n[[File:CG1 changi airport faregates.jpg|left|thumb|Changi Airport is one of the few stations where faregates are on the same level as the platforms.]]\nBefore the MRT line, Changi Airport had been operating with no [[Airport rail link|rail link]] and with full reliance on [[Taxicabs of Singapore|taxi]] and [[Bus transport in Singapore|bus connections]] since the airport began operations in 1981. This has proven effective given the short 20 kilometre distance to the city via the [[East Coast Parkway]] and affordability of taxis and buses. Public buses instead link commuters to nearby MRT stations at [[Bedok MRT station|Bedok]], [[Tampines MRT station|Tampines]] and [[Pasir Ris MRT station|Pasir Ris]].
