He developed a compelling image as the [[charisma]]tic rock-and-roll front man, similar to contemporaries such as [[Roger Daltrey]] of [[the Who]], [[Freddie Mercury]] of [[Queen (band)|Queen]], [[Mick Jagger]] of [[the Rolling Stones]] and [[Jim Morrison]] of [[the Doors]].<ref name=\"theirtime\" /> With his mane of long blond hair and powerful, bare-chested appearance, Plant helped to create the \"god of rock and roll\" or \"rock god\" archetype. Although Led Zeppelin dissolved in 1980, Plant occasionally collaborated with [[Jimmy Page]] on various projects through this period, including forming a short-lived all-star group with Page and [[Jeff Beck]] in 1984, called [[the Honeydrippers]].

Plant received no songwriting credits on the band's first album, allegedly because he was still under contract to [[Sony Music Entertainment|CBS Records]] at the time.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}} Plant brought along [[John Bonham]] as drummer, and they were joined by [[John Paul Jones (musician)|John Paul Jones]], who had previously worked with Page as a studio musician.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}} Jones called Page on the phone before they checked out Plant, and Page hired Jones immediately.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}\n\n[[File:Robert-Plant.jpg|thumb|Plant with Led Zeppelin, 1973]]\nInitially dubbed the \"New Yardbirds\" in 1968, the band soon came to be known as [[Led Zeppelin]]. The band's [[Eponym#Other eponyms|eponymous]] [[Led Zeppelin (album)|debut album]] hit the charts in 1969 and is widely credited as a catalyst for the [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]] genre. Plant has commented that it is unfair for people to think of Zeppelin as heavy metal, as almost a third of their music was acoustic.<ref>''The History of Rock 'n' Roll: The '70s: Have a Nice Decade''.{{full citation needed|date=June 2016}}</ref>{{full citation needed|date=June 2016}}\n\nIn 1975, Plant and his wife Maureen (now divorced) were seriously injured in a car crash in [[Rhodes]], Greece.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ledzeppelin.com/event/august-8-1975 |title=Plant Car Accident, Tour Postponed (Press Release)|website=Led Zeppelin - Official Website|language=en|accessdate=23 April 2018}}</ref> This significantly affected the production of Led Zeppelin's seventh album ''[[Presence (album)|Presence]]'' for a few months while he recovered, and forced the band to cancel the remaining tour dates for the year.\n\nIn July 1977, his son Karac died at the age of five while Plant was engaged on Led Zeppelin's [[Led Zeppelin North American Tour 1977|concert tour of the United States]]. It was a devastating loss for the family. Plant retreated to his home in the Midlands, and for months afterward questioned his future.<ref name=\"CelebrationII\">Lewis, Dave (2003). ''Led Zeppelin: Celebration II: The 'Tight But Loose' Files'', London: Omnibus Press. {{ISBN|1844490564}}, p. 54.</ref> Karac's death later inspired him to write several songs in tribute: \"[[All My Love (Led Zeppelin song)|All My Love]]\" featured on Led Zeppelin's final studio album, 1979's ''[[In Through the Out Door]]'', while \"Blue Train\" featured on [[Page and Plant]]'s second and final (studio) album, 1998's ''[[Walking into Clarksdale]]''.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}} The song \"I Believe\" on Plant's solo album ''[[Fate of Nations]]'' is another tribute to his late son.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}\n\n\n====Lyrics====\n{{BLP sources section|date=June 2008}}\nPlant did not begin writing song lyrics with Led Zeppelin until the making of ''[[Led Zeppelin II]]'', in 1969. According to Jimmy Page:\n\n{{bquote|The most important thing about [[Led Zeppelin II]] is that up to that point I'd contributed lyrics. Robert hadn't written before, and it took a lot of ribbing to get him into writing, which was funny. And then, on the second LP, he wrote the words of Thank You. He said, \"I'd like to have a crack at this and write it for my wife.\"<ref>Kent, Nick. \"Led Zeppelin: Eyewitness.\" '' Mojo Magazine: Classic Rock Special Issue'' (2009, Volume 2, 1ssue 6), p. 104.</ref>}}\n\n[[File:Led Zeppelin acoustic 1973.jpg|thumb|Plant and Page performing an acoustic set at [[Musikhalle Hamburg]], in 1973]]\nPlant's lyrics with Led Zeppelin were often mystical, philosophical and spiritual, alluding to events in classical and [[Norse mythology]], such as \"[[Immigrant Song]]\", which refers to [[Valhalla]] and [[Viking]] conquests.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://search.credoreference.com/content/entry/ffcpop/led_zeppelin/0 |title=Led Zeppelin {{!}} The Faber Companion to 20th Century Popular Music - Credo Reference |website=search.credoreference.com |accessdate=23 April 2018}}</ref> However, the song \"[[No Quarter (song)|No Quarter]]\" is often misunderstood to refer to the god [[Thor]]; the song actually refers to [[Mount Thor]] (which is named after the god). Another example is \"[[The Rain Song]]\".\n\nPlant was also influenced by [[J. R. R. Tolkien]],<ref>Robert Plant himself, in ''[[Vox (magazine)|Vox]]'', May 1993, page 18, stated, \"The self-indulgence, the silly over-the-top Tolkien-esque stuff ... [[John Bonham|John]] made it everlasting.\".</ref><ref>Helen Armstrong (1993), 'The Singer, not the Song', in ''Amon Hen'' (the bulletin of [[The Tolkien Society]], U.K.), no. 123 p..4-5.</ref> whose book series inspired lyrics in some early Led Zeppelin songs. Most notably, \"[[The Battle of Evermore]]\", \"[[Misty Mountain Hop]]\", \"[[No Quarter (song)|No Quarter]]\", \"[[Ramble On]]\" and \"[[Over the Hills and Far Away (Led Zeppelin song)|Over the Hills and Far Away]]\" contain verses referencing Tolkien's ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' and ''[[The Hobbit]]''.<ref name=\":0\" /> Conversely, Plant sometimes used more straightforward blues-based lyrics dealing primarily with sexual innuendo, as in \"[[The Lemon Song]]\", \"[[Trampled Under Foot]]\", and \"[[Black Dog (song)|Black Dog]]\".\n\n[[Welsh mythology]] also forms a basis of Plant's interest in mystical lyrics. He grew up close to the Welsh border and would often take summer trips to [[Snowdonia]]. Plant bought a Welsh sheep farm in 1973, and began taking Welsh lessons and looking into the mythology of the land (such as [[Black Book of Carmarthen]], [[Book of Taliesin]], etc.) Plant's first son, Karac, was named after the Welsh warrior [[Caratacus]]. The song \"[[Bron-Y-Aur Stomp]]\" is named after the 18th-century Welsh cottage [[Bron-Yr-Aur]], owned by a friend of his father; it later inspired the song \"[[Bron-Yr-Aur (instrumental)|Bron-Yr-Aur]]\".<ref name=\":0\">{{cite book |title=The Life and Times of Led Zeppelin |last=Morris |first=Robin |publisher=Assegai Publishing |year=2012 |isbn=9781620957936 |location=Jeffreys Bay, South Africa |pages=50}}</ref> The songs \"Misty Mountain Hop\", \"[[That's the Way (Led Zeppelin song)|That's the Way]]\", and early dabblings in what would become \"[[Stairway to Heaven]]\" were written in Wales and lyrically reflect Plant's mystical view of the land. Critic Steve Turner suggests that Plant's early and continued experiences in Wales served as the foundation for his broader interest in the mythologies he revisits in his lyrics (including those myth systems of Tolkien and the Norse).<ref>\"Stairway to Heaven, Paved with Gold: Led Zeppelin's Snowdonia\", ''The Independent'', 6 April 1991.</ref>\n\nPage's passion for diverse musical experiences influenced Plant to explore Africa, specifically [[Marrakesh]] in Morocco where he encountered [[Umm Kulthum]]:\n\n{{bquote|I was intrigued by the scales, initially, and obviously the vocal work. The way she sang, the way she could hold a note, you could feel the tension, you could tell that everybody, the whole orchestra, would hold a note until she wanted to change.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/features/robert-plant-i-feel-so-far-away-from-heavy-rock-2063017.html |title=Robert Plant: 'I feel so far away from heavy rock' |work=The Independent |location=UK |accessdate=30 August 2010 |date=27 August 2010 |author=Andy Gill}}</ref>}}\n\nThat musical inspiration eventually culminated in \"[[Kashmir (song)|Kashmir]]\". Both he and Jimmy Page revisited these influences during their reunion album ''[[No Quarter: Jimmy Page and Robert Plant Unledded]]'' in 1994.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.biography.com/people/robert-plant-12103147 |title=Robert Plant |website=Biography |accessdate=26 April 2018}}</ref> During his solo career Plant tapped into these influences many times, most notably on the 2002 album ''[[Dreamland (Robert Plant album)|Dreamland]]''.\n\nArguably one of Plant's most significant achievements with Led Zeppelin was his contribution to the track \"[[Stairway to Heaven]]\", an epic rock [[ballad]] featured on ''[[Led Zeppelin IV]]'' that drew influence from [[folk music|folk]], [[blues]], [[Celtic music|Celtic traditional music]] and [[hard rock]] among other genres.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/view/10.1093/gmo/9781561592630.001.0001/omo-9781561592630-e-0000045837 |title=Led Zeppelin {{!}} Grove Music |doi=10.1093/gmo/9781561592630.article.45837 |accessdate=26 April 2018}}</ref> Most of the lyrics of the song were written spontaneously by Plant in 1970 at [[Headley Grange]]. While never released as a single, the song has topped polls as the greatest song of all time.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/newsitems/200412/s1272083.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050309135735/http://www.abc.net.au/news/newsitems/200412/s1272083.htm |url-status=dead |archive-date=9 March 2005 |title=Rockers still climbing 'Stairway to heaven' |date=25 December 2004|website=ABC News Online |publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation |accessdate=25 February 2017}}</ref>\n\nPlant is also recognised for his lyrical improvisation in [[Led Zeppelin concerts|Led Zeppelin's live performances]], often singing verses previously unheard on studio recordings. One of the most famous Led Zeppelin musical devices involves Plant's vocal mimicking of bandmate Jimmy Page's guitar effects. This can be heard in the songs \"[[How Many More Times]]\", \"[[Dazed and Confused (song)|Dazed and Confused]]\", \"[[The Lemon Song]]\", \"[[You Shook Me]]\", \"[[Nobody's Fault but Mine]]\" and \"[[Sick Again]]\".\n\nHe is also known for his light-hearted, humorous and unusual on-stage banter. Plant often discusses the origin and background of the songs during his shows, and sometimes provides social comment as well. He frequently talks about American blues musicians as his inspiration, mentioning artists like [[Robert Johnson (musician)|Robert Johnson]], [[Howlin' Wolf]], [[Blind Willie Johnson]] and [[Willie Dixon]] at the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] induction ceremony and the 2007 [[Ahmet Erteg\u00fcn Tribute Concert]] with Led Zeppelin.\n\n====Stage persona====\n[[File:Jimmy Page with Robert Plant 2 - Led Zeppelin - 1977.jpg|thumb|Plant (left) with Led Zeppelin guitarist Jimmy Page in concert in Chicago, Illinois, 1977.]]\nPlant enjoyed great success with Led Zeppelin throughout the 1970s and developed a compelling image as the [[charisma]]tic rock-and-roll front man, similar to his contemporaries [[the Who]]'s singer [[Roger Daltrey]], [[Mick Jagger]] of the [[Rolling Stones]], and [[Jim Morrison]] of [[the Doors]].<ref name=theirtime>\"Their Time is Gonna Come\", ''[[Classic Rock Magazine]]: Classic Rock Presents Led Zeppelin'', 2008.</ref> With his mane of long blond hair and powerful, bare-chested appearance, Plant helped to create the \"god of rock and roll\" or \"rock god\" archetype. On stage, Plant was particularly active in live performances, often dancing, jumping, skipping, snapping his fingers, clapping, making emphatic gestures to emphasise a lyric or cymbal crash, throwing back his head, or placing his hands on his hips. As the 1970s progressed he, along with the other members of Led Zeppelin, became increasingly flamboyant on-stage, and wore more elaborate, colourful clothing and jewellery.\n\nAccording to ''[[Classic Rock (magazine)|Classic Rock]]'' magazine, \"once he had a couple of US tours under his belt, 'Percy' Plant swiftly developed a staggering degree of bravado and swagger that irrefutably enhanced Led Zeppelin's rapidly burgeoning appeal.\"<ref>Ian Fortnam, \"Dazed & confused\", ''[[Classic Rock Magazine]]: Classic Rock Presents Led Zeppelin'', 2008, p. 43.</ref> In 1994, during his \"Unledded\" tour with Jimmy Page, Plant himself reflected tongue-in-cheek upon his Led Zeppelin showmanship:\n\n{{bquote|I can't take my whole persona as a singer back then very seriously. It's not some great work of beauty and love to be a [[rock-and-roll]] singer.

Readers of the magazine had to decide who had the best chest in rock, and Plant was the winner. When they contacted him about it, he replied: \"I'm really greatly honoured although it's hard for me to be eloquent on the subject of my chest.\"<ref>''Rock Scene'', June 1974, Four Seasons Publications, Inc. 59287-4</ref>\n\n===Solo career (1982\u2013present)===\n\n====Early career and success (1982\u20131993)====\nAfter Led Zeppelin disbanded in December 1980 (following the death of drummer [[John Bonham]]), Plant briefly considered abandoning music to pursue a career as a teacher in the [[Waldorf education|Rudolf Steiner education system]], going so far as to be accepted for teacher training. He nevertheless embarked on a successful solo career, helped by encouragement from [[Genesis (band)|Genesis]] drummer [[Phil Collins]], who would go on to play with him.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.musictimes.com/articles/23372/20150106/robert-plant-praises-phil-collins-encouraging-solo-career-led-zeppelin-split.htm |title=Robert Plant Praises Phil Collins For Encouraging His Solo Career After Led Zeppelin's Split |work=Music Times |first=Shawn |last=Christ |date=6 January 2015 |accessdate=21 July 2015}}</ref> Plant's solo career began with the album ''[[Pictures at Eleven]]'' in 1982, followed by 1983's ''[[The Principle of Moments]]''. Popular tracks from this period include \"[[Big Log]]\" (a Top 20 hit in 1983), \"[[In the Mood (Robert Plant song)|In the Mood]]\" (1983), \"[[Little by Little (Robert Plant song)|Little by Little]]\" (from 1985's ''[[Shaken 'n' Stirred]]''), \"Far Post\" (originally only on the B-side of \"[[Burning Down One Side]]\" but popularised by airplay on [[album-oriented rock]] stations), \"[[Tall Cool One (Robert Plant song)|Tall Cool One]]\" (a No. 25 hit from 1988's ''[[Now and Zen]]'') and later \"[[I Believe (Robert Plant song)|I Believe]]\" (from 1993's ''[[Fate of Nations]]''). This last track, like Led Zeppelin's \"[[All My Love (Led Zeppelin song)|All My Love]]\", was written for and dedicated to his late son, Karac.  Whilst Plant avoided performing Led Zeppelin songs through much of this period (although he would occasionally improvise his unique Zeppelin screams into his set), his tours in 1983 (with Phil Collins on drums) and in 1985 were very successful, often performing to sold-out arena-sized venues. In 1986 Plant performed at the [[Heart Beat 86|Birmingham Heart Beat Charity Concert]] with other famous Midlands musicians. \n[[File:Robert Plant and Phil Johnstone, backstage at Glastonbury Festival, 1993.jpg|alt=The two men looking rocked-out and happy posing for a photo|thumb|Plant and [[Phil Johnstone]], backstage at the [[Glastonbury Festival]], 1993]]\n\nDuring the late 1980s and early 1990s Plant co-wrote three solo albums with keyboardist/songwriter [[Phil Johnstone]]. These were: ''[[Now and Zen]]'' in 1988, ''[[Manic Nirvana]]'' in 1990, and the 1993 ''[[Fate of Nations]]'' (which features [[Moya Brennan]] of [[Clannad (musical group)|Clannad]] and former [[Cutting Crew]] guitarist [[Kevin MacMichael|Kevin Scott MacMichael]]). Songs from this third album, plus a smattering of Led Zeppelin classics, made up the set-list for Plant's acclaimed sunset performance on the Main Stage at Glastonbury Festival, in 1993.<ref>{{Cite web|title = 1993|url = http://www.glastonburyfestivals.co.uk/history/history-1993/|website = Glastonbury Festival - 24\u201328 June 2015|accessdate = 12 February 2016|first = Pretty Good|last = Digital}}</ref>  It was Johnstone who talked Plant into playing Led Zeppelin songs in his live shows, something Plant had always previously resisted, not wanting to be forever known as \"the former Led Zeppelin vocalist\".\n\nAlthough Led Zeppelin split in 1980, Plant occasionally collaborated with [[Jimmy Page]] on various projects through this period, including forming a short-lived all-star group with Page and [[Jeff Beck]] in 1984, called [[the Honeydrippers]]. They released an album called ''[[The Honeydrippers: Volume One]]'', and the band had a No. 3 hit with a remake of the [[Phil Phillips]]' tune \"[[Sea of Love (song)|Sea of Love]]\", plus a follow-up hit with a cover of [[Roy Brown (blues musician)|Roy Brown]]'s \"[[Rockin' at Midnight]]\". The pair again worked together in the studio on the 1988 Page solo effort ''[[Outrider (album)|Outrider]]'', and in the same year Page contributed to Plant's album ''Now and Zen''. Also, on 15 May 1988 Plant appeared with Page as a member of Led Zeppelin, at the [[Atlantic Records 40th Anniversary]] concert (where he also performed in his own right as a solo artist).  Plant's live collaborations with other well-known musicians continued when he took to the stage with Queen at Wembley Stadium, for 1992's \"The Freddie Mercury Tribute Concert\" for AIDS Awareness; where he sang Queen's \"[[Innuendo (song)|Innuendo]]\" and \"[[Crazy Little Thing Called Love]]\", and Led Zeppelin's \"[[Kashmir (song)|Kashmir]]\" and \"[[Thank You (Led Zeppelin song)|Thank You]]\".\n\n====Page and Plant (1994\u20131998)====\n[[Page and Plant]] became a full-fledged performing act from 1994 through 1998, releasing the ''[[No Quarter: Jimmy Page and Robert Plant Unledded]]'' album in 1994 and following with an enormously successful tour in 1995, including a return to the Glastonbury limelight. Fourteen years of speculation from their fans and occasional sniping between the two former members ended when they reconvened their former musical partnership to produce ''No Quarter''. Having long resisted offers from MTV to reform to do an ''Unplugged'' show, they finally accepted as part of a deal that also allowed them to visit Morocco to record new material. The album combines the results of both of these projects. The Led Zeppelin material features new arrangements and new instrumentation, including strings, Egyptian musicians and the vocals of British-Asian star Najma Akhtar.\n\nPage and Plant recorded their only post-Zeppelin album of original material on the 1998 album ''[[Walking into Clarksdale]]'', an effort that was unsuccessful commercially, leading Plant to return to his solo career. A song from this album, \"[[Please Read the Letter]]\", was re-recorded by Plant with [[Alison Krauss]], and was featured on their 2007 album which won the [[Grammy Award for Record of the Year]].\n\n====Priory of Brion (1999\u20132000)====\nStarting in mid-1999, Plant performed until the end of 2000 at several small venues with his folk-rock band, named Priory of Brion. This band consisted of the original Band of Joy guitarist Kevyn Gammond alongside [[Andy Edwards (musician)|Andy Edwards]] (drums) Paul Timothy (keyboards) and Paul Wetton (bass).

He developed a compelling image as the [[charisma]]tic rock-and-roll front man, similar to contemporaries such as [[Roger Daltrey]] of [[the Who]], [[Freddie Mercury]] of [[Queen (band)|Queen]], [[Mick Jagger]] of [[the Rolling Stones]] and [[Jim Morrison]] of [[the Doors]].<ref name=\"theirtime\" /> With his mane of long blond hair and powerful, bare-chested appearance, Plant helped to create the \"god of rock and roll\" or \"rock god\" archetype. Although Led Zeppelin dissolved in 1980, Plant occasionally collaborated with [[Jimmy Page]] on various projects through this period, including forming a short-lived all-star group with Page and [[Jeff Beck]] in 1984, called [[the Honeydrippers]].

The band's [[Eponym#Other eponyms|eponymous]] [[Led Zeppelin (album)|debut album]] hit the charts in 1969 and is widely credited as a catalyst for the [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]] genre. Plant has commented that it is unfair for people to think of Zeppelin as heavy metal, as almost a third of their music was acoustic.<ref>''The History of Rock 'n' Roll: The '70s: Have a Nice Decade''.{{full citation needed|date=June 2016}}</ref>{{full citation needed|date=June 2016}}\n\nIn 1975, Plant and his wife Maureen (now divorced) were seriously injured in a car crash in [[Rhodes]], Greece.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ledzeppelin.com/event/august-8-1975 |title=Plant Car Accident, Tour Postponed (Press Release)|website=Led Zeppelin - Official Website|language=en|accessdate=23 April 2018}}</ref> This significantly affected the production of Led Zeppelin's seventh album ''[[Presence (album)|Presence]]'' for a few months while he recovered, and forced the band to cancel the remaining tour dates for the year.\n\nIn July 1977, his son Karac died at the age of five while Plant was engaged on Led Zeppelin's [[Led Zeppelin North American Tour 1977|concert tour of the United States]]. It was a devastating loss for the family. Plant retreated to his home in the Midlands, and for months afterward questioned his future.<ref name=\"CelebrationII\">Lewis, Dave (2003). ''Led Zeppelin: Celebration II: The 'Tight But Loose' Files'', London: Omnibus Press. {{ISBN|1844490564}}, p. 54.</ref> Karac's death later inspired him to write several songs in tribute: \"[[All My Love (Led Zeppelin song)|All My Love]]\" featured on Led Zeppelin's final studio album, 1979's ''[[In Through the Out Door]]'', while \"Blue Train\" featured on [[Page and Plant]]'s second and final (studio) album, 1998's ''[[Walking into Clarksdale]]''.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}} The song \"I Believe\" on Plant's solo album ''[[Fate of Nations]]'' is another tribute to his late son.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}\n\n\n====Lyrics====\n{{BLP sources section|date=June 2008}}\nPlant did not begin writing song lyrics with Led Zeppelin until the making of ''[[Led Zeppelin II]]'', in 1969. According to Jimmy Page:\n\n{{bquote|The most important thing about [[Led Zeppelin II]] is that up to that point I'd contributed lyrics. Robert hadn't written before, and it took a lot of ribbing to get him into writing, which was funny. And then, on the second LP, he wrote the words of Thank You. He said, \"I'd like to have a crack at this and write it for my wife.\"<ref>Kent, Nick. \"Led Zeppelin: Eyewitness.\" '' Mojo Magazine: Classic Rock Special Issue'' (2009, Volume 2, 1ssue 6), p. 104.</ref>}}\n\n[[File:Led Zeppelin acoustic 1973.jpg|thumb|Plant and Page performing an acoustic set at [[Musikhalle Hamburg]], in 1973]]\nPlant's lyrics with Led Zeppelin were often mystical, philosophical and spiritual, alluding to events in classical and [[Norse mythology]], such as \"[[Immigrant Song]]\", which refers to [[Valhalla]] and [[Viking]] conquests.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://search.credoreference.com/content/entry/ffcpop/led_zeppelin/0 |title=Led Zeppelin {{!}} The Faber Companion to 20th Century Popular Music - Credo Reference |website=search.credoreference.com |accessdate=23 April 2018}}</ref> However, the song \"[[No Quarter (song)|No Quarter]]\" is often misunderstood to refer to the god [[Thor]]; the song actually refers to [[Mount Thor]] (which is named after the god). Another example is \"[[The Rain Song]]\".\n\nPlant was also influenced by [[J. R. R. Tolkien]],<ref>Robert Plant himself, in ''[[Vox (magazine)|Vox]]'', May 1993, page 18, stated, \"The self-indulgence, the silly over-the-top Tolkien-esque stuff ... [[John Bonham|John]] made it everlasting.\".</ref><ref>Helen Armstrong (1993), 'The Singer, not the Song', in ''Amon Hen'' (the bulletin of [[The Tolkien Society]], U.K.), no. 123 p..4-5.</ref> whose book series inspired lyrics in some early Led Zeppelin songs. Most notably, \"[[The Battle of Evermore]]\", \"[[Misty Mountain Hop]]\", \"[[No Quarter (song)|No Quarter]]\", \"[[Ramble On]]\" and \"[[Over the Hills and Far Away (Led Zeppelin song)|Over the Hills and Far Away]]\" contain verses referencing Tolkien's ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' and ''[[The Hobbit]]''.<ref name=\":0\" /> Conversely, Plant sometimes used more straightforward blues-based lyrics dealing primarily with sexual innuendo, as in \"[[The Lemon Song]]\", \"[[Trampled Under Foot]]\", and \"[[Black Dog (song)|Black Dog]]\".\n\n[[Welsh mythology]] also forms a basis of Plant's interest in mystical lyrics. He grew up close to the Welsh border and would often take summer trips to [[Snowdonia]]. Plant bought a Welsh sheep farm in 1973, and began taking Welsh lessons and looking into the mythology of the land (such as [[Black Book of Carmarthen]], [[Book of Taliesin]], etc.) Plant's first son, Karac, was named after the Welsh warrior [[Caratacus]]. The song \"[[Bron-Y-Aur Stomp]]\" is named after the 18th-century Welsh cottage [[Bron-Yr-Aur]], owned by a friend of his father; it later inspired the song \"[[Bron-Yr-Aur (instrumental)|Bron-Yr-Aur]]\".<ref name=\":0\">{{cite book |title=The Life and Times of Led Zeppelin |last=Morris |first=Robin |publisher=Assegai Publishing |year=2012 |isbn=9781620957936 |location=Jeffreys Bay, South Africa |pages=50}}</ref> The songs \"Misty Mountain Hop\", \"[[That's the Way (Led Zeppelin song)|That's the Way]]\", and early dabblings in what would become \"[[Stairway to Heaven]]\" were written in Wales and lyrically reflect Plant's mystical view of the land. Critic Steve Turner suggests that Plant's early and continued experiences in Wales served as the foundation for his broader interest in the mythologies he revisits in his lyrics (including those myth systems of Tolkien and the Norse).<ref>\"Stairway to Heaven, Paved with Gold: Led Zeppelin's Snowdonia\", ''The Independent'', 6 April 1991.</ref>\n\nPage's passion for diverse musical experiences influenced Plant to explore Africa, specifically [[Marrakesh]] in Morocco where he encountered [[Umm Kulthum]]:\n\n{{bquote|I was intrigued by the scales, initially, and obviously the vocal work. The way she sang, the way she could hold a note, you could feel the tension, you could tell that everybody, the whole orchestra, would hold a note until she wanted to change.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/features/robert-plant-i-feel-so-far-away-from-heavy-rock-2063017.html |title=Robert Plant: 'I feel so far away from heavy rock' |work=The Independent |location=UK |accessdate=30 August 2010 |date=27 August 2010 |author=Andy Gill}}</ref>}}\n\nThat musical inspiration eventually culminated in \"[[Kashmir (song)|Kashmir]]\". Both he and Jimmy Page revisited these influences during their reunion album ''[[No Quarter: Jimmy Page and Robert Plant Unledded]]'' in 1994.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.biography.com/people/robert-plant-12103147 |title=Robert Plant |website=Biography |accessdate=26 April 2018}}</ref> During his solo career Plant tapped into these influences many times, most notably on the 2002 album ''[[Dreamland (Robert Plant album)|Dreamland]]''.\n\nArguably one of Plant's most significant achievements with Led Zeppelin was his contribution to the track \"[[Stairway to Heaven]]\", an epic rock [[ballad]] featured on ''[[Led Zeppelin IV]]'' that drew influence from [[folk music|folk]], [[blues]], [[Celtic music|Celtic traditional music]] and [[hard rock]] among other genres.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/view/10.1093/gmo/9781561592630.001.0001/omo-9781561592630-e-0000045837 |title=Led Zeppelin {{!}} Grove Music |doi=10.1093/gmo/9781561592630.article.45837 |accessdate=26 April 2018}}</ref> Most of the lyrics of the song were written spontaneously by Plant in 1970 at [[Headley Grange]]. While never released as a single, the song has topped polls as the greatest song of all time.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/newsitems/200412/s1272083.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050309135735/http://www.abc.net.au/news/newsitems/200412/s1272083.htm |url-status=dead |archive-date=9 March 2005 |title=Rockers still climbing 'Stairway to heaven' |date=25 December 2004|website=ABC News Online |publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation |accessdate=25 February 2017}}</ref>\n\nPlant is also recognised for his lyrical improvisation in [[Led Zeppelin concerts|Led Zeppelin's live performances]], often singing verses previously unheard on studio recordings. One of the most famous Led Zeppelin musical devices involves Plant's vocal mimicking of bandmate Jimmy Page's guitar effects. This can be heard in the songs \"[[How Many More Times]]\", \"[[Dazed and Confused (song)|Dazed and Confused]]\", \"[[The Lemon Song]]\", \"[[You Shook Me]]\", \"[[Nobody's Fault but Mine]]\" and \"[[Sick Again]]\".\n\nHe is also known for his light-hearted, humorous and unusual on-stage banter. Plant often discusses the origin and background of the songs during his shows, and sometimes provides social comment as well. He frequently talks about American blues musicians as his inspiration, mentioning artists like [[Robert Johnson (musician)|Robert Johnson]], [[Howlin' Wolf]], [[Blind Willie Johnson]] and [[Willie Dixon]] at the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] induction ceremony and the 2007 [[Ahmet Erteg\u00fcn Tribute Concert]] with Led Zeppelin.\n\n====Stage persona====\n[[File:Jimmy Page with Robert Plant 2 - Led Zeppelin - 1977.jpg|thumb|Plant (left) with Led Zeppelin guitarist Jimmy Page in concert in Chicago, Illinois, 1977.]]\nPlant enjoyed great success with Led Zeppelin throughout the 1970s and developed a compelling image as the [[charisma]]tic rock-and-roll front man, similar to his contemporaries [[the Who]]'s singer [[Roger Daltrey]], [[Mick Jagger]] of the [[Rolling Stones]], and [[Jim Morrison]] of [[the Doors]].<ref name=theirtime>\"Their Time is Gonna Come\", ''[[Classic Rock Magazine]]: Classic Rock Presents Led Zeppelin'', 2008.</ref> With his mane of long blond hair and powerful, bare-chested appearance, Plant helped to create the \"god of rock and roll\" or \"rock god\" archetype. On stage, Plant was particularly active in live performances, often dancing, jumping, skipping, snapping his fingers, clapping, making emphatic gestures to emphasise a lyric or cymbal crash, throwing back his head, or placing his hands on his hips. As the 1970s progressed he, along with the other members of Led Zeppelin, became increasingly flamboyant on-stage, and wore more elaborate, colourful clothing and jewellery.\n\nAccording to ''[[Classic Rock (magazine)|Classic Rock]]'' magazine, \"once he had a couple of US tours under his belt, 'Percy' Plant swiftly developed a staggering degree of bravado and swagger that irrefutably enhanced Led Zeppelin's rapidly burgeoning appeal.\"<ref>Ian Fortnam, \"Dazed & confused\", ''[[Classic Rock Magazine]]: Classic Rock Presents Led Zeppelin'', 2008, p. 43.</ref> In 1994, during his \"Unledded\" tour with Jimmy Page, Plant himself reflected tongue-in-cheek upon his Led Zeppelin showmanship:\n\n{{bquote|I can't take my whole persona as a singer back then very seriously. It's not some great work of beauty and love to be a [[rock-and-roll]] singer.

Readers of the magazine had to decide who had the best chest in rock, and Plant was the winner. When they contacted him about it, he replied: \"I'm really greatly honoured although it's hard for me to be eloquent on the subject of my chest.\"<ref>''Rock Scene'', June 1974, Four Seasons Publications, Inc. 59287-4</ref>\n\n===Solo career (1982\u2013present)===\n\n====Early career and success (1982\u20131993)====\nAfter Led Zeppelin disbanded in December 1980 (following the death of drummer [[John Bonham]]), Plant briefly considered abandoning music to pursue a career as a teacher in the [[Waldorf education|Rudolf Steiner education system]], going so far as to be accepted for teacher training. He nevertheless embarked on a successful solo career, helped by encouragement from [[Genesis (band)|Genesis]] drummer [[Phil Collins]], who would go on to play with him.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.musictimes.com/articles/23372/20150106/robert-plant-praises-phil-collins-encouraging-solo-career-led-zeppelin-split.htm |title=Robert Plant Praises Phil Collins For Encouraging His Solo Career After Led Zeppelin's Split |work=Music Times |first=Shawn |last=Christ |date=6 January 2015 |accessdate=21 July 2015}}</ref> Plant's solo career began with the album ''[[Pictures at Eleven]]'' in 1982, followed by 1983's ''[[The Principle of Moments]]''. Popular tracks from this period include \"[[Big Log]]\" (a Top 20 hit in 1983), \"[[In the Mood (Robert Plant song)|In the Mood]]\" (1983), \"[[Little by Little (Robert Plant song)|Little by Little]]\" (from 1985's ''[[Shaken 'n' Stirred]]''), \"Far Post\" (originally only on the B-side of \"[[Burning Down One Side]]\" but popularised by airplay on [[album-oriented rock]] stations), \"[[Tall Cool One (Robert Plant song)|Tall Cool One]]\" (a No. 25 hit from 1988's ''[[Now and Zen]]'') and later \"[[I Believe (Robert Plant song)|I Believe]]\" (from 1993's ''[[Fate of Nations]]''). This last track, like Led Zeppelin's \"[[All My Love (Led Zeppelin song)|All My Love]]\", was written for and dedicated to his late son, Karac.  Whilst Plant avoided performing Led Zeppelin songs through much of this period (although he would occasionally improvise his unique Zeppelin screams into his set), his tours in 1983 (with Phil Collins on drums) and in 1985 were very successful, often performing to sold-out arena-sized venues. In 1986 Plant performed at the [[Heart Beat 86|Birmingham Heart Beat Charity Concert]] with other famous Midlands musicians. \n[[File:Robert Plant and Phil Johnstone, backstage at Glastonbury Festival, 1993.jpg|alt=The two men looking rocked-out and happy posing for a photo|thumb|Plant and [[Phil Johnstone]], backstage at the [[Glastonbury Festival]], 1993]]\n\nDuring the late 1980s and early 1990s Plant co-wrote three solo albums with keyboardist/songwriter [[Phil Johnstone]]. These were: ''[[Now and Zen]]'' in 1988, ''[[Manic Nirvana]]'' in 1990, and the 1993 ''[[Fate of Nations]]'' (which features [[Moya Brennan]] of [[Clannad (musical group)|Clannad]] and former [[Cutting Crew]] guitarist [[Kevin MacMichael|Kevin Scott MacMichael]]). Songs from this third album, plus a smattering of Led Zeppelin classics, made up the set-list for Plant's acclaimed sunset performance on the Main Stage at Glastonbury Festival, in 1993.<ref>{{Cite web|title = 1993|url = http://www.glastonburyfestivals.co.uk/history/history-1993/|website = Glastonbury Festival - 24\u201328 June 2015|accessdate = 12 February 2016|first = Pretty Good|last = Digital}}</ref>  It was Johnstone who talked Plant into playing Led Zeppelin songs in his live shows, something Plant had always previously resisted, not wanting to be forever known as \"the former Led Zeppelin vocalist\".\n\nAlthough Led Zeppelin split in 1980, Plant occasionally collaborated with [[Jimmy Page]] on various projects through this period, including forming a short-lived all-star group with Page and [[Jeff Beck]] in 1984, called [[the Honeydrippers]]. They released an album called ''[[The Honeydrippers: Volume One]]'', and the band had a No. 3 hit with a remake of the [[Phil Phillips]]' tune \"[[Sea of Love (song)|Sea of Love]]\", plus a follow-up hit with a cover of [[Roy Brown (blues musician)|Roy Brown]]'s \"[[Rockin' at Midnight]]\". The pair again worked together in the studio on the 1988 Page solo effort ''[[Outrider (album)|Outrider]]'', and in the same year Page contributed to Plant's album ''Now and Zen''. Also, on 15 May 1988 Plant appeared with Page as a member of Led Zeppelin, at the [[Atlantic Records 40th Anniversary]] concert (where he also performed in his own right as a solo artist).  Plant's live collaborations with other well-known musicians continued when he took to the stage with Queen at Wembley Stadium, for 1992's \"The Freddie Mercury Tribute Concert\" for AIDS Awareness; where he sang Queen's \"[[Innuendo (song)|Innuendo]]\" and \"[[Crazy Little Thing Called Love]]\", and Led Zeppelin's \"[[Kashmir (song)|Kashmir]]\" and \"[[Thank You (Led Zeppelin song)|Thank You]]\".\n\n====Page and Plant (1994\u20131998)====\n[[Page and Plant]] became a full-fledged performing act from 1994 through 1998, releasing the ''[[No Quarter: Jimmy Page and Robert Plant Unledded]]'' album in 1994 and following with an enormously successful tour in 1995, including a return to the Glastonbury limelight. Fourteen years of speculation from their fans and occasional sniping between the two former members ended when they reconvened their former musical partnership to produce ''No Quarter''. Having long resisted offers from MTV to reform to do an ''Unplugged'' show, they finally accepted as part of a deal that also allowed them to visit Morocco to record new material. The album combines the results of both of these projects. The Led Zeppelin material features new arrangements and new instrumentation, including strings, Egyptian musicians and the vocals of British-Asian star Najma Akhtar.\n\nPage and Plant recorded their only post-Zeppelin album of original material on the 1998 album ''[[Walking into Clarksdale]]'', an effort that was unsuccessful commercially, leading Plant to return to his solo career. A song from this album, \"[[Please Read the Letter]]\", was re-recorded by Plant with [[Alison Krauss]], and was featured on their 2007 album which won the [[Grammy Award for Record of the Year]].\n\n====Priory of Brion (1999\u20132000)====\nStarting in mid-1999, Plant performed until the end of 2000 at several small venues with his folk-rock band, named Priory of Brion. This band consisted of the original Band of Joy guitarist Kevyn Gammond alongside [[Andy Edwards (musician)|Andy Edwards]] (drums) Paul Timothy (keyboards) and Paul Wetton (bass).

This is said verbally, \"Twenty divided by four equals five.\" ]]\n\n'''Division''' is one of the four basic operations of [[arithmetic]], the ways that numbers are combined to make new numbers. The other operations are [[addition]], [[subtraction]], and [[multiplication]] (which can be viewed as the inverse of division). The [[division sign]] (<code>\u00f7</code>), a symbol consisting of a short horizontal line with a dot above and another dot below, is often used to indicate mathematical division. This usage, though widespread in [[anglophone countries]], is neither universal nor recommended: the [[ISO 80000-2]] standard for [[mathematical notation]] recommends only the [[Slash (punctuation)|solidus]] (<code>/</code>) or fraction bar for division, or the colon for [[ratio]]s; it says that this symbol \"should not be used\" for division.<ref>[[ISO 80000-2]], Section 9 \"Operations\", 2-9.6</ref>\n\nAt an elementary level the division of two [[natural number]]s is \u2013 among other [[Quotition and partition|possible interpretations]] \u2013 the process of calculating the number of times one number is contained within another one.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Blake|first1=A. G.|title=Arithmetic|date=1887|publisher=[[Alexander Thom (almanac editor)|Alexander Thom & Company]]|location=[[Dublin|Dublin, Ireland]]}}</ref>{{rp|7}} This number of times is not always an [[integer]] (a number that can be obtained using the other arithmetic operations on the natural numbers), which led to two different concepts.{{Citation needed|date=September 2019}}\n\nThe [[division with remainder]] or [[Euclidean division]] of two [[natural numbers]] provides a ''quotient'', which is the number of times the second one is contained in the first one, and a ''remainder'', which is the part of the first number that remains, when in the course of computing the quotient, no further full chunk of the size of the second number can be allocated.\n\nFor a modification of this division to yield only one single result, the natural numbers must be extended to [[rational number]]s (the numbers that can be obtained by using arithmetic on natural numbers) or [[real number]]s. In these enlarged [[number system]]s, division is the inverse operation to multiplication, that is {{math|''a'' {{=}} ''c'' \u00f7 ''b''}} means {{math|''a'' \u00d7 ''b'' {{=}} ''c''}}, as long as {{math|''b''}} is not zero. If {{math|1=''b'' = 0}}, then this is a [[division by zero]], which is not defined.{{efn|Division by zero may be defined in some circumstances, either by extending the real numbers to the [[extended real number line]] or to the [[projectively extended real line]] or when occurring as limit of divisions by numbers tending to 0. For example: {{math|lim<sub>''x''\u21920</sub> {{sfrac|sin ''x''|''x''}} {{=}} 1.}}<ref name=\"mwdiv\" /><ref name=\"db0\">{{MathWorld|id=DivisionbyZero|title=Division by Zero}}</ref>}}<ref>{{cite book|last1=Derbyshire|first1=John|title=Prime Obsession: Bernhard Riemann and the Greatest Unsolved Problem in Mathematics|date=2004|publisher=[[Penguin Books]]|location=[[New York City]]|isbn=978-0-452-28525-5}}</ref>{{rp|246}}\n\nBoth forms of division appear in various [[algebraic structure]]s, different ways of defining mathematical structure. Those in which a Euclidean division (with remainder) is defined are called [[Euclidean domain]]s and include [[polynomial ring]]s in one [[indeterminate (variable)|indeterminate]] (which define multiplication and addition over single-variabled formulas). Those in which a division (with a single result) by all nonzero elements is defined are called [[field (mathematics)|fields]] and [[division ring]]s. In a [[ring (mathematics)|ring]] the elements by which division is always possible are called the [[unit (ring theory)|units]] (for example, 1 and \u20131 in the ring of integers). Another generalization of division to algebraic structures is the [[quotient group]], in which the result of 'division' is a group rather than a number.\n\n==Introduction==\nThe simplest way of viewing division is in terms of [[quotition and partition]]: from the quotition perspective, {{math|20&nbsp;\u00f7&nbsp;5}} means the number of 5s that must be added to get&nbsp;20. In terms of partition, {{math|20&nbsp;\u00f7&nbsp;5}} means the size of each of 5 parts into which a set of size 20 is divided. For example, 20 apples divide into four groups of five apples, meaning that ''twenty divided by five is equal to four''. This is denoted as {{math|1=20 / 5 = 4}}, {{math|20 \u00f7 5 {{=}} 4}}, or {{math|1={{sfrac|20|5}} = 4}}.<ref name=\"mwdiv\">{{MathWorld|id=Division|title=Division}}</ref> What is being divided is called the ''dividend'', which is divided by the ''divisor'', and the result is called the ''quotient''. In the example, 20 is the dividend, 5 is the divisor, and 4 is the quotient.\n\nUnlike the other basic operations, when dividing natural numbers there is sometimes a [[remainder]] that will not go evenly into the dividend; for example, {{math|10 \u00f7 3}} leaves a remainder of 1, as 10 is not a multiple of 3. Sometimes this remainder is added to the quotient as a [[fractional part]], so {{math|10 \u00f7 3}} is equal to {{math|{{sfrac|3|1|3}}}} or {{math|3.33...}}, but in the context of [[integer]] division, where numbers have no fractional part, the remainder is kept separately or discarded.<ref name=\"mwintdiv\">{{MathWorld|id=IntegerDivision|title=Integer Division}}</ref> When the remainder is kept as a fraction, it leads to a [[rational number]].

For example, \"''a'' divided by ''b\"'' can written as:\n:<math>\\frac ab</math>\n\nwhich can also be read out loud as \"''a'' by ''b''\" or \"''a'' over ''b''\". A way to express division all on one line is to write the ''dividend'' (or numerator), then a [[Slash (punctuation)|slash]], then the ''divisor'' (or denominator), as follows:\n:<math>a/b</math>\n\nThis is the usual way of specifying division in most computer [[programming language]]s, since it can easily be typed as a simple sequence of [[ASCII]] characters. Some [[mathematical software]], such as [[MATLAB]] and [[GNU Octave]], allows the operands to be written in the reverse order by using the [[backslash]] as the division operator:\n:<math>b\\backslash a</math>\n\nA typographical variation halfway between these two forms uses a [[solidus (punctuation)|solidus]] (fraction slash) but elevates the dividend, and lowers the divisor:\n:<math>{}^{a}/{}_{b}</math>\n\nAny of these forms can be used to display a [[fraction (mathematics)|fraction]]. A fraction is a division expression where both dividend and divisor are [[integer]]s (typically called the ''numerator'' and ''denominator''), and there is no implication that the division must be evaluated further. A second way to show division is to use the [[obelus]] (or division sign), common in arithmetic, in this manner:\n:<math>a \\div b</math>\n\nThis form is infrequent except in elementary arithmetic. [[ISO 80000-2]]-9.6 states it should not be used. The obelus is also used alone to represent the division operation itself, as for instance as a label on a key of a [[calculator]]. The obelus was introduced by Swiss mathematician [[Johann Rahn]] in 1659 in ''Teutsche Algebra''.<ref name=\"Cajori\">{{cite book|author=Cajori, Florian|title=A History of Mathematical Notations|url=https://archive.org/details/b29980343_0002|publisher=Open Court Pub.

Distributing the objects several at a time in each round of sharing to each portion leads to the idea of '[[Chunking (division)|chunking]]'{{snd}} a form of division where one repeatedly subtracts multiples of the divisor from the dividend itself. \n\nBy allowing one to subtract more multiples than what the partial remainder allows at a given stage, more flexible methods, such as the bidirectional variant of chunking, can be developed as well.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://mathvault.ca/long-division/|title=The Definitive Higher Math Guide to Long Division and Its Variants \u2013 for Integers|date=2019-02-24|website=Math Vault|language=en-US|access-date=2019-06-24|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190621042203/https://mathvault.ca/long-division/|archive-date=2019-06-21|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nMore systematic and more efficient (but also more formalised, more rule-based, and more removed from an overall holistic picture of what division is achieving), a person who knows the [[multiplication tables]] can divide two integers with pencil and paper using the method of [[short division]], if the divisor is small, or [[long division]], if the divisor is larger. If the dividend has a [[fraction (mathematics)|fractional]] part (expressed as a [[decimal fraction]]), one can continue the algorithm past the ones place as far as desired. If the divisor has a fractional part, one can restate the problem by moving the decimal to the right in both numbers until the divisor has no fraction.\n\nA person can calculate division with an [[abacus]] by repeatedly placing the dividend on the abacus, and then subtracting the divisor the offset of each digit in the result, counting the number of divisions possible at each offset.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://owlcation.com/stem/How-to-do-Division-on-the-Abacus-in-Easy-Steps|title=How to Do Division on the Abacus in Easy Steps|website=Owlcation|language=en|access-date=2019-06-24|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190624204231/https://owlcation.com/stem/How-to-do-Division-on-the-Abacus-in-Easy-Steps|archive-date=2019-06-24|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nA person can use [[logarithm tables]] to divide two numbers, by subtracting the two numbers' logarithms, then looking up the antilogarithm of the result.\n\nA person can calculate division with a [[slide rule]] by aligning the divisor on the C scale with the dividend on the D scale. The quotient can be found on the D scale where it is aligned with the left index on the C scale. The user is responsible, however, for mentally keeping track of the decimal point.\n\n===By computer or with computer assistance===\nModern computers compute division by methods that are faster than long division, with the more efficient ones relying on approximation techniques from numerical analysis. For [[division with remainder]], see [[Division algorithm]].\n\nIn [[modular arithmetic]] (modulo a prime number) and for [[real numbers]], nonzero numbers have a [[modular multiplicative inverse|multiplicative inverse]]. In these cases, a division by {{mvar|x}} may be computed as the product by the multiplicative inverse of {{mvar|x}}. This approach is often associated with the faster methods in computer arithmetic.\n\n==Division in different contexts==\n=== Euclidean division ===\n{{main|Euclidean division}}\nThe Euclidean division is the mathematical formulation of the outcome of the usual process of division of integers. It asserts that, given two integers, ''a'', the ''dividend'', and ''b'', the ''divisor'', such that ''b'' \u2260 0, there are [[Uniqueness quantification|unique]] integers ''q'', the ''quotient'', and ''r'', the remainder,  such that ''a'' = ''bq'' + ''r'' and 0 \u2264 ''r'' < {{abs|''b''}}, where {{abs|''b''}} denotes the [[absolute value]] of ''b''.\n\n=== Of integers ===\nIntegers are not [[Closure (mathematics)|closed]] under division. Apart from division by zero being undefined, the quotient is not an integer unless the dividend is an integer multiple of the divisor. For example, 26 cannot be divided by 11 to give an integer. Such a case uses one of five approaches:\n# Say that 26 cannot be divided by 11; division becomes a [[partial function]].\n# Give an approximate answer as a [[decimal fraction]] or a [[mixed number]], so <math>\\tfrac{26}{11} \\simeq 2.36</math> or <math>\\tfrac{26}{11} \\simeq 2 \\tfrac {36}{100}.</math> This is the approach usually taken in [[numerical computation]].\n# Give the answer as a [[fraction (mathematics)|fraction]] representing a [[rational number]], so the result of the division of 26 by 11 is <math>\\tfrac{26}{11}.</math> But, usually, the resulting fraction should be simplified: the result of the division of 52 by 22 is also <math>\\tfrac{26}{11}</math>. This simplification may be done by factoring out the [[greatest common divisor]].\n# Give the answer as an integer ''[[quotient]]'' and a ''[[remainder]]'', so <math>\\tfrac{26}{11} = 2 \\mbox{ remainder } 4.</math> To make the distinction with the previous case, this division, with two integers as result, is sometimes called ''[[Euclidean division]]'', because it is the basis of the [[Euclidean algorithm]].\n# Give the integer quotient as the answer, so <math>\\tfrac{26}{11} = 2.</math> This is sometimes called ''integer division''.\nDividing integers in a [[computer program]] requires special care. Some [[programming language]]s, such as [[C (programming language)|C]], treat integer division as in case 5 above, so the answer is an integer. Other languages, such as [[MATLAB]] and every [[computer algebra system]] return a rational number as the answer, as in case 3 above. These languages also provide functions to get the results of the other cases, either directly or from the result of case 3.\n\nNames and symbols used for integer division include div, /, \\, and %. Definitions vary regarding integer division when the dividend or the divisor is negative: rounding may be toward zero (so called T-division) or toward [[Extended real number line|\u2212\u221e]] (F-division); rarer styles can occur \u2013 see [[Modulo operation]] for the details.\n\n[[Divisibility rule]]s can sometimes be used to quickly determine whether one integer divides exactly into another.\n\n=== Of rational numbers ===\nThe result of dividing two [[rational number]]s is another rational number when the divisor is not 0. The division of two rational numbers ''p''/''q'' and ''r''/''s'' can be computed as\n:<math>{p/q \\over r/s} = {p \\over q} \\times {s \\over r} = {ps \\over qr}.</math>\n\nAll four quantities are integers, and only ''p'' may be 0. This definition ensures that division is the inverse operation of [[multiplication]].\n\n=== Of real numbers ===\nDivision of two [[real number]]s results in another real number (when the divisor is nonzero). It is defined such that ''a''/''b'' = ''c'' if and only if ''a'' = ''cb'' and ''b'' \u2260 0.\n\n=== Of complex numbers ===\nDividing two [[complex number]]s (when the divisor is nonzero) results in another complex number, which is found using the conjugate of the denominator:\n:<math>{p+iq \\over r+is} = {(p+iq)(r-is) \\over (r+is)(r-is)} = {pr+qs + i(qr-ps) \\over r^2+s^2} = {pr+qs \\over r^2+s^2} + i{qr-ps \\over r^2+s^2}.</math>\n\nThis process of multiplying and dividing by <math>r-is</math> is called 'realisation' or (by analogy) [[Rationalisation (mathematics)|rationalisation]]. All four quantities ''p'', ''q'', ''r'', ''s'' are real numbers, and ''r'' and ''s'' may not both be 0.\n\nDivision for complex numbers expressed in polar form is simpler than the definition above:\n:<math>{p e^{iq} \\over r e^{is}} = {p e^{iq} e^{-is} \\over r e^{is} e^{-is}} = {p \\over r}e^{i(q - s)}. </math>\n\nAgain all four quantities ''p'', ''q'', ''r'', ''s'' are real numbers, and ''r'' may not be 0.\n\n=== Of polynomials ===\nOne can define the division operation for [[polynomial]]s in one variable over a [[field (mathematics)|field]]. Then, as in the case of integers, one has a remainder. See [[Euclidean division of polynomials]], and, for hand-written computation, [[polynomial long division]] or [[synthetic division]].\n\n=== Of matrices ===\nOne can define a division operation for matrices. The usual way to do this is to define {{nowrap|1=''A'' / ''B'' = ''AB''<sup>\u22121</sup>}}, where {{nowrap|''B''<sup>\u22121</sup>}} denotes the [[inverse matrix|inverse]] of ''B'', but it is far more common to write out {{nowrap|''AB''<sup>\u22121</sup>}} explicitly to avoid confusion. An [[elementwise division]] can also be defined in terms of the [[Hadamard product (matrices)|Hadamard product]].\n\n==== Left and right division ====\nBecause [[matrix multiplication]] is not [[commutative]], one can also define a [[left division]] or so-called ''backslash-division'' as {{nowrap|1=''A'' \\ ''B'' = ''A''<sup>\u22121</sup>''B''}}. For this to be well defined, {{nowrap|''B''<sup>\u22121</sup>}} need not exist, however {{nowrap|''A''<sup>\u22121</sup>}} does need to exist. To avoid confusion, division as defined by {{nowrap|1=''A'' / ''B'' = ''AB''<sup>\u22121</sup>}} is sometimes called ''right division'' or ''slash-division'' in this context.\n\nNote that with left and right division defined this way, {{nowrap|''A'' / (''BC'')}} is in general not the same as {{nowrap|(''A'' / ''B'') / ''C''}}, nor is {{nowrap|(''AB'') \\ ''C''}} the same as {{nowrap|''A'' \\ (''B'' \\ ''C'')}}. However, it holds that {{nowrap|1=''A'' / (''BC'') = (''A'' / ''C'') / ''B''}} and {{nowrap|1=(''AB'') \\ ''C'' = ''B'' \\ (''A'' \\ ''C'')}}.\n\n==== Pseudoinverse ====\nTo avoid problems when {{nowrap|''A''<sup>\u22121</sup>}} and/or {{nowrap|''B''<sup>\u22121</sup>}} do not exist, division can also be defined as multiplication by the [[Generalized inverse|pseudoinverse]]. That is, {{nowrap|1=''A'' / ''B'' = ''AB''<sup>+</sup>}} and {{nowrap|1=''A'' \\ ''B'' = ''A''<sup>+</sup>''B''}}, where {{nowrap|''A''<sup>+</sup>}} and {{nowrap|''B''<sup>+</sup>}} denote the pseudoinverses of ''A'' and ''B''.\n\n=== Abstract algebra ===\nIn [[abstract algebra]], given a [[Magma (algebra)|magma]] with binary operation \u2217 (which could nominally be termed multiplication), left division of ''b'' by ''a'' (written {{nowrap|''a'' \\ ''b''}}) is typically defined as the solution ''x'' to the equation {{nowrap|1=''a'' \u2217 ''x'' = ''b''}}, if this exists and is unique.  Similarly, right division of ''b'' by ''a'' (written {{nowrap|''b'' / ''a''}}) is the solution ''y'' to the equation {{nowrap|1=''y'' \u2217 ''a'' = ''b''}}.  Division in this sense does not require \u2217 to have any particular properties (such as commutativity, associativity, or an identity element).\n\n\"Division\" in the sense of \"cancellation\" can be done in any magma by an element with the [[cancellation property]].  Examples include [[Matrix (mathematics)|matrix]] algebras and [[quaternion]] algebras.  A [[quasigroup]] is a structure in which division is always possible, even without an identity element and hence inverses.  In an [[integral domain]], where not every element need have an inverse, ''division'' by a cancellative element ''a'' can still be performed on elements of the form ''ab'' or ''ca'' by left or right cancellation, respectively.  If a [[Ring (mathematics)|ring]] is finite and every nonzero element is cancellative, then by an application of the [[pigeonhole principle]], every nonzero element of the ring is invertible, and ''division'' by any nonzero element is possible. To learn about when ''algebras'' (in the technical sense) have a division operation, refer to the page on [[division algebra]]s. In particular [[Bott periodicity]] can be used to show that any [[real number|real]] [[normed division algebra]] must be [[isomorphic]] to either the real numbers '''R''', the [[complex number]]s '''C''', the [[quaternion]]s '''H''', or the [[octonion]]s '''O'''.\n<!-- Left vs right, definition of quasigroup, relationship to inverse elements in presence of associativity, examples: groups, octonions -->\n\n=== Calculus ===\nThe [[derivative]] of the quotient of two functions is given by the [[quotient rule]]:\n:<math>{\\left(\\frac fg\\right)}' = \\frac{f'g - fg'}{g^2}.</math>\n\n== Division by zero ==\n{{main|Division by zero}}\nDivision of any number by [[zero]] in most mathematical systems is undefined, because zero multiplied by any finite number always results in a [[multiplication|product]] of zero.<ref>http://mathworld.wolfram.com/DivisionbyZero.html {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181023234325/http://mathworld.wolfram.com/DivisionbyZero.html |date=2018-10-23 }} Retrieved October 23 2018</ref> Entry of such an expression into most [[calculator]]s produces an error message.

The other operations are [[addition]], [[subtraction]], and [[multiplication]] (which can be viewed as the inverse of division). The [[division sign]] (<code>\u00f7</code>), a symbol consisting of a short horizontal line with a dot above and another dot below, is often used to indicate mathematical division. This usage, though widespread in [[anglophone countries]], is neither universal nor recommended: the [[ISO 80000-2]] standard for [[mathematical notation]] recommends only the [[Slash (punctuation)|solidus]] (<code>/</code>) or fraction bar for division, or the colon for [[ratio]]s; it says that this symbol \"should not be used\" for division.<ref>[[ISO 80000-2]], Section 9 \"Operations\", 2-9.6</ref>\n\nAt an elementary level the division of two [[natural number]]s is \u2013 among other [[Quotition and partition|possible interpretations]] \u2013 the process of calculating the number of times one number is contained within another one.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Blake|first1=A. G.|title=Arithmetic|date=1887|publisher=[[Alexander Thom (almanac editor)|Alexander Thom & Company]]|location=[[Dublin|Dublin, Ireland]]}}</ref>{{rp|7}} This number of times is not always an [[integer]] (a number that can be obtained using the other arithmetic operations on the natural numbers), which led to two different concepts.{{Citation needed|date=September 2019}}\n\nThe [[division with remainder]] or [[Euclidean division]] of two [[natural numbers]] provides a ''quotient'', which is the number of times the second one is contained in the first one, and a ''remainder'', which is the part of the first number that remains, when in the course of computing the quotient, no further full chunk of the size of the second number can be allocated.\n\nFor a modification of this division to yield only one single result, the natural numbers must be extended to [[rational number]]s (the numbers that can be obtained by using arithmetic on natural numbers) or [[real number]]s. In these enlarged [[number system]]s, division is the inverse operation to multiplication, that is {{math|''a'' {{=}} ''c'' \u00f7 ''b''}} means {{math|''a'' \u00d7 ''b'' {{=}} ''c''}}, as long as {{math|''b''}} is not zero. If {{math|1=''b'' = 0}}, then this is a [[division by zero]], which is not defined.{{efn|Division by zero may be defined in some circumstances, either by extending the real numbers to the [[extended real number line]] or to the [[projectively extended real line]] or when occurring as limit of divisions by numbers tending to 0. For example: {{math|lim<sub>''x''\u21920</sub> {{sfrac|sin ''x''|''x''}} {{=}} 1.}}<ref name=\"mwdiv\" /><ref name=\"db0\">{{MathWorld|id=DivisionbyZero|title=Division by Zero}}</ref>}}<ref>{{cite book|last1=Derbyshire|first1=John|title=Prime Obsession: Bernhard Riemann and the Greatest Unsolved Problem in Mathematics|date=2004|publisher=[[Penguin Books]]|location=[[New York City]]|isbn=978-0-452-28525-5}}</ref>{{rp|246}}\n\nBoth forms of division appear in various [[algebraic structure]]s, different ways of defining mathematical structure. Those in which a Euclidean division (with remainder) is defined are called [[Euclidean domain]]s and include [[polynomial ring]]s in one [[indeterminate (variable)|indeterminate]] (which define multiplication and addition over single-variabled formulas). Those in which a division (with a single result) by all nonzero elements is defined are called [[field (mathematics)|fields]] and [[division ring]]s. In a [[ring (mathematics)|ring]] the elements by which division is always possible are called the [[unit (ring theory)|units]] (for example, 1 and \u20131 in the ring of integers). Another generalization of division to algebraic structures is the [[quotient group]], in which the result of 'division' is a group rather than a number.\n\n==Introduction==\nThe simplest way of viewing division is in terms of [[quotition and partition]]: from the quotition perspective, {{math|20&nbsp;\u00f7&nbsp;5}} means the number of 5s that must be added to get&nbsp;20. In terms of partition, {{math|20&nbsp;\u00f7&nbsp;5}} means the size of each of 5 parts into which a set of size 20 is divided. For example, 20 apples divide into four groups of five apples, meaning that ''twenty divided by five is equal to four''. This is denoted as {{math|1=20 / 5 = 4}}, {{math|20 \u00f7 5 {{=}} 4}}, or {{math|1={{sfrac|20|5}} = 4}}.<ref name=\"mwdiv\">{{MathWorld|id=Division|title=Division}}</ref> What is being divided is called the ''dividend'', which is divided by the ''divisor'', and the result is called the ''quotient''. In the example, 20 is the dividend, 5 is the divisor, and 4 is the quotient.\n\nUnlike the other basic operations, when dividing natural numbers there is sometimes a [[remainder]] that will not go evenly into the dividend; for example, {{math|10 \u00f7 3}} leaves a remainder of 1, as 10 is not a multiple of 3. Sometimes this remainder is added to the quotient as a [[fractional part]], so {{math|10 \u00f7 3}} is equal to {{math|{{sfrac|3|1|3}}}} or {{math|3.33...}}, but in the context of [[integer]] division, where numbers have no fractional part, the remainder is kept separately or discarded.<ref name=\"mwintdiv\">{{MathWorld|id=IntegerDivision|title=Integer Division}}</ref> When the remainder is kept as a fraction, it leads to a [[rational number]]. The set of all rational numbers is created by every possible division using integers.

For example, \"''a'' divided by ''b\"'' can written as:\n:<math>\\frac ab</math>\n\nwhich can also be read out loud as \"''a'' by ''b''\" or \"''a'' over ''b''\". A way to express division all on one line is to write the ''dividend'' (or numerator), then a [[Slash (punctuation)|slash]], then the ''divisor'' (or denominator), as follows:\n:<math>a/b</math>\n\nThis is the usual way of specifying division in most computer [[programming language]]s, since it can easily be typed as a simple sequence of [[ASCII]] characters. Some [[mathematical software]], such as [[MATLAB]] and [[GNU Octave]], allows the operands to be written in the reverse order by using the [[backslash]] as the division operator:\n:<math>b\\backslash a</math>\n\nA typographical variation halfway between these two forms uses a [[solidus (punctuation)|solidus]] (fraction slash) but elevates the dividend, and lowers the divisor:\n:<math>{}^{a}/{}_{b}</math>\n\nAny of these forms can be used to display a [[fraction (mathematics)|fraction]]. A fraction is a division expression where both dividend and divisor are [[integer]]s (typically called the ''numerator'' and ''denominator''), and there is no implication that the division must be evaluated further. A second way to show division is to use the [[obelus]] (or division sign), common in arithmetic, in this manner:\n:<math>a \\div b</math>\n\nThis form is infrequent except in elementary arithmetic. [[ISO 80000-2]]-9.6 states it should not be used. The obelus is also used alone to represent the division operation itself, as for instance as a label on a key of a [[calculator]]. The obelus was introduced by Swiss mathematician [[Johann Rahn]] in 1659 in ''Teutsche Algebra''.<ref name=\"Cajori\">{{cite book|author=Cajori, Florian|title=A History of Mathematical Notations|url=https://archive.org/details/b29980343_0002|publisher=Open Court Pub.

Distributing the objects several at a time in each round of sharing to each portion leads to the idea of \"[[Chunking (division)|chunking]]\" \u2013 a form of division where one repeatedly subtracts multiples of the divisor from the dividend itself. \n\nBy allowing one to subtract more multiples than what the partial remainder allows at a given stage, more flexible methods, such as the bidirectional variant of chunking, can be developed as well.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://mathvault.ca/long-division/|title=The Definitive Higher Math Guide to Long Division and Its Variants \u2013 for Integers|date=2019-02-24|website=Math Vault|language=en-US|access-date=2019-06-24|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190621042203/https://mathvault.ca/long-division/|archive-date=2019-06-21|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nMore systematic and more efficient (but also more formalised, more rule-based, and more removed from an overall holistic picture of what division is achieving), a person who knows the [[multiplication tables]] can divide two integers with pencil and paper using the method of [[short division]], if the divisor is small, or [[long division]], if the divisor is larger. If the dividend has a [[fraction (mathematics)|fractional]] part (expressed as a [[decimal fraction]]), one can continue the algorithm past the ones place as far as desired. If the divisor has a fractional part, one can restate the problem by moving the decimal to the right in both numbers until the divisor has no fraction.\n\nA person can calculate division with an [[abacus]] by repeatedly placing the dividend on the abacus, and then subtracting the divisor the offset of each digit in the result, counting the number of divisions possible at each offset.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://owlcation.com/stem/How-to-do-Division-on-the-Abacus-in-Easy-Steps|title=How to Do Division on the Abacus in Easy Steps|website=Owlcation|language=en|access-date=2019-06-24|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190624204231/https://owlcation.com/stem/How-to-do-Division-on-the-Abacus-in-Easy-Steps|archive-date=2019-06-24|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nA person can use [[logarithm tables]] to divide two numbers, by subtracting the two numbers' logarithms, then looking up the antilogarithm of the result.\n\nA person can calculate division with a [[slide rule]] by aligning the divisor on the C scale with the dividend on the D scale. The quotient can be found on the D scale where it is aligned with the left index on the C scale. The user is responsible, however, for mentally keeping track of the decimal point.\n\n===By computer or with computer assistance===\nModern computers compute division by methods that are faster than long division, with the more efficient ones relying on approximation techniques from numerical analysis. For [[division with remainder]], see [[Division algorithm]].\n\nIn [[modular arithmetic]] (modulo a prime number) and for [[real numbers]], nonzero numbers have a [[modular multiplicative inverse|multiplicative inverse]]. In these cases, a division by {{mvar|x}} may be computed as the product by the multiplicative inverse of {{mvar|x}}. This approach is often associated with the faster methods in computer arithmetic.\n\n==Division in different contexts==\n=== Euclidean division ===\n{{main|Euclidean division}}\nThe Euclidean division is the mathematical formulation of the outcome of the usual process of division of integers. It asserts that, given two integers, ''a'', the ''dividend'', and ''b'', the ''divisor'', such that ''b'' \u2260 0, there are [[Uniqueness quantification|unique]] integers ''q'', the ''quotient'', and ''r'', the remainder,  such that ''a'' = ''bq'' + ''r'' and 0 \u2264 ''r'' < {{abs|''b''}}, where {{abs|''b''}} denotes the [[absolute value]] of ''b''.\n\n=== Of integers ===\nIntegers are not [[Closure (mathematics)|closed]] under division. Apart from division by zero being undefined, the quotient is not an integer unless the dividend is an integer multiple of the divisor. For example, 26 cannot be divided by 11 to give an integer. Such a case uses one of five approaches:\n# Say that 26 cannot be divided by 11; division becomes a [[partial function]].\n# Give an approximate answer as a [[decimal fraction]] or a [[mixed number]], so <math>\\tfrac{26}{11} \\simeq 2.36</math> or <math>\\tfrac{26}{11} \\simeq 2 \\tfrac {36}{100}.</math> This is the approach usually taken in [[numerical computation]].\n# Give the answer as a [[fraction (mathematics)|fraction]] representing a [[rational number]], so the result of the division of 26 by 11 is <math>\\tfrac{26}{11}.</math> But, usually, the resulting fraction should be simplified: the result of the division of 52 by 22 is also <math>\\tfrac{26}{11}</math>. This simplification may be done by factoring out the [[greatest common divisor]].\n# Give the answer as an integer ''[[quotient]]'' and a ''[[remainder]]'', so <math>\\tfrac{26}{11} = 2 \\mbox{ remainder } 4.</math> To make the distinction with the previous case, this division, with two integers as result, is sometimes called ''[[Euclidean division]]'', because it is the basis of the [[Euclidean algorithm]].\n# Give the integer quotient as the answer, so <math>\\tfrac{26}{11} = 2.</math> This is sometimes called ''integer division''.\nDividing integers in a [[computer program]] requires special care. Some [[programming language]]s, such as [[C (programming language)|C]], treat integer division as in case 5 above, so the answer is an integer. Other languages, such as [[MATLAB]] and every [[computer algebra system]] return a rational number as the answer, as in case 3 above. These languages also provide functions to get the results of the other cases, either directly or from the result of case 3.\n\nNames and symbols used for integer division include div, /, \\, and %. Definitions vary regarding integer division when the dividend or the divisor is negative: rounding may be toward zero (so called T-division) or toward [[Extended real number line|\u2212\u221e]] (F-division); rarer styles can occur \u2013 see [[Modulo operation]] for the details.\n\n[[Divisibility rule]]s can sometimes be used to quickly determine whether one integer divides exactly into another.\n\n=== Of rational numbers ===\nThe result of dividing two [[rational number]]s is another rational number when the divisor is not 0. The division of two rational numbers ''p''/''q'' and ''r''/''s'' can be computed as\n:<math>{p/q \\over r/s} = {p \\over q} \\times {s \\over r} = {ps \\over qr}.</math>\n\nAll four quantities are integers, and only ''p'' may be 0. This definition ensures that division is the inverse operation of [[multiplication]].\n\n=== Of real numbers ===\nDivision of two [[real number]]s results in another real number (when the divisor is nonzero). It is defined such that ''a''/''b'' = ''c'' if and only if ''a'' = ''cb'' and ''b'' \u2260 0.\n\n=== Of complex numbers ===\nDividing two [[complex number]]s (when the divisor is nonzero) results in another complex number, which is found using the conjugate of the denominator:\n:<math>{p+iq \\over r+is} = {(p+iq)(r-is) \\over (r+is)(r-is)} = {pr+qs + i(qr-ps) \\over r^2+s^2} = {pr+qs \\over r^2+s^2} + i{qr-ps \\over r^2+s^2}.</math>\n\nThis process of multiplying and dividing by <math>r-is</math> is called 'realisation' or (by analogy) [[Rationalisation (mathematics)|rationalisation]]. All four quantities ''p'', ''q'', ''r'', ''s'' are real numbers, and ''r'' and ''s'' may not both be 0.\n\nDivision for complex numbers expressed in polar form is simpler than the definition above:\n:<math>{p e^{iq} \\over r e^{is}} = {p e^{iq} e^{-is} \\over r e^{is} e^{-is}} = {p \\over r}e^{i(q - s)}. </math>\n\nAgain all four quantities ''p'', ''q'', ''r'', ''s'' are real numbers, and ''r'' may not be 0.\n\n=== Of polynomials ===\nOne can define the division operation for [[polynomial]]s in one variable over a [[field (mathematics)|field]]. Then, as in the case of integers, one has a remainder. See [[Euclidean division of polynomials]], and, for hand-written computation, [[polynomial long division]] or [[synthetic division]].\n\n=== Of matrices ===\nOne can define a division operation for matrices. The usual way to do this is to define {{nowrap|1=''A'' / ''B'' = ''AB''<sup>\u22121</sup>}}, where {{nowrap|''B''<sup>\u22121</sup>}} denotes the [[inverse matrix|inverse]] of ''B'', but it is far more common to write out {{nowrap|''AB''<sup>\u22121</sup>}} explicitly to avoid confusion. An [[elementwise division]] can also be defined in terms of the [[Hadamard product (matrices)|Hadamard product]].\n\n==== Left and right division ====\nBecause [[matrix multiplication]] is not [[commutative]], one can also define a [[left division]] or so-called ''backslash-division'' as {{nowrap|1=''A'' \\ ''B'' = ''A''<sup>\u22121</sup>''B''}}. For this to be well defined, {{nowrap|''B''<sup>\u22121</sup>}} need not exist, however {{nowrap|''A''<sup>\u22121</sup>}} does need to exist. To avoid confusion, division as defined by {{nowrap|1=''A'' / ''B'' = ''AB''<sup>\u22121</sup>}} is sometimes called ''right division'' or ''slash-division'' in this context.\n\nNote that with left and right division defined this way, {{nowrap|''A'' / (''BC'')}} is in general not the same as {{nowrap|(''A'' / ''B'') / ''C''}}, nor is {{nowrap|(''AB'') \\ ''C''}} the same as {{nowrap|''A'' \\ (''B'' \\ ''C'')}}. However, it holds that {{nowrap|1=''A'' / (''BC'') = (''A'' / ''C'') / ''B''}} and {{nowrap|1=(''AB'') \\ ''C'' = ''B'' \\ (''A'' \\ ''C'')}}.\n\n==== Pseudoinverse ====\nTo avoid problems when {{nowrap|''A''<sup>\u22121</sup>}} and/or {{nowrap|''B''<sup>\u22121</sup>}} do not exist, division can also be defined as multiplication by the [[Generalized inverse|pseudoinverse]]. That is, {{nowrap|1=''A'' / ''B'' = ''AB''<sup>+</sup>}} and {{nowrap|1=''A'' \\ ''B'' = ''A''<sup>+</sup>''B''}}, where {{nowrap|''A''<sup>+</sup>}} and {{nowrap|''B''<sup>+</sup>}} denote the pseudoinverses of ''A'' and ''B''.\n\n=== Abstract algebra ===\nIn [[abstract algebra]], given a [[Magma (algebra)|magma]] with binary operation \u2217 (which could nominally be termed multiplication), left division of ''b'' by ''a'' (written {{nowrap|''a'' \\ ''b''}}) is typically defined as the solution ''x'' to the equation {{nowrap|1=''a'' \u2217 ''x'' = ''b''}}, if this exists and is unique.  Similarly, right division of ''b'' by ''a'' (written {{nowrap|''b'' / ''a''}}) is the solution ''y'' to the equation {{nowrap|1=''y'' \u2217 ''a'' = ''b''}}.  Division in this sense does not require \u2217 to have any particular properties (such as commutativity, associativity, or an identity element).\n\n\"Division\" in the sense of \"cancellation\" can be done in any magma by an element with the [[cancellation property]].  Examples include [[Matrix (mathematics)|matrix]] algebras and [[quaternion]] algebras.  A [[quasigroup]] is a structure in which division is always possible, even without an identity element and hence inverses.  In an [[integral domain]], where not every element need have an inverse, ''division'' by a cancellative element ''a'' can still be performed on elements of the form ''ab'' or ''ca'' by left or right cancellation, respectively.  If a [[Ring (mathematics)|ring]] is finite and every nonzero element is cancellative, then by an application of the [[pigeonhole principle]], every nonzero element of the ring is invertible, and ''division'' by any nonzero element is possible. To learn about when ''algebras'' (in the technical sense) have a division operation, refer to the page on [[division algebra]]s. In particular [[Bott periodicity]] can be used to show that any [[real number|real]] [[normed division algebra]] must be [[isomorphic]] to either the real numbers '''R''', the [[complex number]]s '''C''', the [[quaternion]]s '''H''', or the [[octonion]]s '''O'''.\n<!-- Left vs right, definition of quasigroup, relationship to inverse elements in presence of associativity, examples: groups, octonions -->\n\n=== Calculus ===\nThe [[derivative]] of the quotient of two functions is given by the [[quotient rule]]:\n:<math>{\\left(\\frac fg\\right)}' = \\frac{f'g - fg'}{g^2}.</math>\n\n== Division by zero ==\n{{main|Division by zero}}\nDivision of any number by [[zero]] in most mathematical systems is undefined, because zero multiplied by any finite number always results in a [[multiplication|product]] of zero.<ref>http://mathworld.wolfram.com/DivisionbyZero.html {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181023234325/http://mathworld.wolfram.com/DivisionbyZero.html |date=2018-10-23 }} Retrieved October 23 2018</ref> Entry of such an expression into most [[calculator]]s produces an error message.
