Tne names Bokoto and Chitopi houses are purely for administrative purposes. Two lineages lived in close proximity for over (3) three centuries at Mahopo Masekwa, Nyakambiri river near Marondera'''.\n\n'''\n'''History''\n\nThe Mangwende clan dominated the geographical area between Makoni and Mutoko in Mashonaland East, Zimbabwe, which then existed in the political format of traditional states. Mangwende had a fighting force that fought rival clans, and was often called to defend allies in battle. Within their territory, the Mangwende chieftainship had several sub-Chiefs of surrounding clans under their protectorate who would pledge allegiance to Chief Mangwende in return for military support if attacked by other rival Chiefs. As the paramount chief, Mangwende administered over the welfare, security and civil order of small chieftainship clans and presided in ceremonial duties.\n\nThe house of '''Hundungu''' who was chief from '''1859-1878''' was the first to assume the title of Chief Mangwende with proper Rozvi investiture. Prior to this period all Chiefs (Mambos) were called or known by their family names. It was about this time that there was a bit of animosity between the two chieftain lineages as it was alleged that the other lineage had attacked the other with a flock of bees from a charm (Gona).  '''Katerere, father to Chiroodza and Chibanda''', ruled for one year '''1878-1879''' and died and was replaced by '''Mungate son of Hundungu''' who became Chief from '''1880-1924'''. He was chief at the time when the white settlers arrived in Zimbabwe, then [[Rhodesia]]. They were based at '''Mahopo Masekwa bordering Marondera'''. The [[totem]] is \"Moyo Muzukuru\", which belongs to entire Nhowe tribe. '''Most of the late Mangwende chiefs are buried at the Mangwende [[shrine]] in Mahopo Masekwa. Over a period of time the Bokoto house decided to bury their chiefs at an Area called Bokoto Hills in [[Mukarakate]], before that they were all buried at Mahopo Masekwa. Only (3) three chiefs were not buried at the Mangwende Shrine, Mahopo Masekwa, being Katerere, Enoch and Chibanda 11 (two)\n\n'''Defiance of White Settlers'''\n\nWhite [[Colonial history of Southern Rhodesia|colonialists]] arrived around the period of  1890 disguised as hunters and missionaries and settled in the territory controlled by Chief Mungate Mangwende. At about 1896, Chief Mangwende fought white settlers who tried to impose on his territory in the famous battles that became known as the 1896 rebellion.\n\nHe led his forces to defend [[Makoni]] who had also been involved in resisting white settlement rule. \n'''Chief Mungate Mangwende's''' oldest son, '''Muchemwa''', through orders from his father the chief fought the [[colonialist]] white settlers in the 1896  with the (uprising) in conjunction with '''Mbuya Nehanda and Kaguwi'''. After Chief Mungate Mangwende made peace with the White settlers (authorities) in 1896 his son '''Muchemwa''' together with other members of Nhowe [[war council]] which included Sandati Mukarakate son of Jirivenge the son of Mhotani, continued to wedge a guerilla type of war as they were disgruntled with white settler rule. This war continued up to 1903 and ended in the fierce battle of Bokoto hills, which lasted several weeks. Muchemwa brokered a deal with the White Settlers (authorities) that he could only lay down his arms together with his lieutenants on condition he did not face any prosecution. The authorities agreed on one condition that he resided next to '''Murewa District Headquarters''' where he would be monitored. After the rebellion the white settlers took over the fertile land in Mahopo Masekwa and Chief Mungate was moved to a place called Rota, Chamachinda.\n\nThe village around the Murewa District Centre is known as the Mangwende Village, with most of its inhabitants being of Nhowe tribe Totem \"Moyo Muzukuru\". At the time of '''Muchemwa's''' death in 1909 (murdered), his father was still on the throne. At the time of his death, he left three sons, '''Mbumbira, Munhuwepayi, and Maiziveyi'''. His second son, Munhuwepayi, became a chief and ruled from '''1937-1960. He was deposed from the chieftainship for continually disagreeing and criticizing white settlers administration decisions which was deemed to be gross insubordination. Another contributing factor for the removal of Munhuwepayi was his participation in politics in the late 1950s 60s which he did up until independence 1980, in '''NDP''' (National Democratic Party) and then '''[[ZAPU]]''' (Zimbabwe African Peoples Union) which merged with '''[[ZANU]]''' (Zimbabwe African National Union) in 1987 into one party called [[Zimbabwe African National Union '''ZANU PF'''. Once dethroned he was sent to detention at '''[[Gonakudzingwa Restriction Camp]]''', (Gonakudzingwa meaning \"where the banished ones sleep\") in Southern Rhodesia, near the Mozambique border, which was a special detention camp for ZAPU political prisoners set up by Ian Smith's government. There were already other political prisoners of the Mukarakate house who were detained at Gonakudzingwa, such as Phineas, Anesu and others. On his release Munhuwepayi, was banished from staying or visiting Murewa and restricted to {{convert|25|km|abbr=on}} radius of Salisbury, now '''Harare'''. Even when his relations died he was not allowed to attend the funerals among them his own children and young brother, '''Maiziveyi Mangwende''' who died in 1971. He later died in November 1988 and was buried at the Mangwende Shrine, at Mahopo Masekwa, near [[Marondera]]. His late brother Maiziveyi\u2019s four sons Innocent, Cyril, Alois and Godfrey as direct descendants of Muchemwa, performed the traditional rites for the late Chief Munhuwepayi to be buried at the Mangwende Shrine.\n\nEnock Mvurayawira,was appointed by the settler Ian Smith\u2019s governement in 1960 to replace Munhuwepayi as Chief Mangwende, after Muzanenhamo Sandati Mukarakate, the eldest son of Sandati Mukarakate in consultation with the Bokoto house advised the settlers that culturally, Bokoto house could not accept the collateral succession while a substantive Chief Mangwende was still alive. \u201cA living Mangwende can not be replaced\u201d. This was in line with proper traditional rites which require notification of the demise of a Chief through death, which could not be performed as Munhuwepayi was still alive.\n\nAfter Enock Mvurayawira\u2019s death in 1968, Jonathan Tafirenyika Chibanda, son of Chataika Chibanda of the Bokoto House was appointed Chief Mangwende in 1969. He became a member of the Chiefs Council in 1973 and was elected President of the Zimbabwe Council of Chiefs in 1991, a position he held for 15 years until he decided to step down in 2005. He successfully engaged the Government on improving the status and role of Chiefs in Zimbabwe which led to a review and improvement of various sections of the Traditional Leaders Act and other statutes governing traditional leaders.  Chief Jonathan Tafirenyika Mangwende died in Pretoria, South Africa in December, 2013 and was declared a Liberation Hero for his role in  assisting the struggle and coordinating support for liberation fighters during the war of liberation which culminated in the independence of Zimbabwe in 1980. He was buried  at Mukarakate in with full military honors and proper traditional rites. He is remembered for his wise leadership as President of the Council of Chiefs in Zimbabwe and for strong and fair leadership of his people.\n\n==References==\n<references />\n<!--- After listing your sources please cite them using inline citations and place them after the information they cite.

The name ''Bali dwipa'' (\"Bali island\") has been discovered from various inscriptions, including the Blanjong pillar inscription written by [[Sri Kesari Warmadewa]] in 914 AD and mentioning '''Walidwipa'''. It was during this time that the people developed their complex irrigation system ''[[Subak (irrigation)|subak]]'' to grow rice in [[wet-field cultivation]]. Some religious and cultural traditions still practiced today can be traced to this period.\n\nThe Hindu [[Majapahit Empire]] (1293\u20131520 AD) on eastern [[Java (island)|Java]] founded a Balinese colony in 1343. The uncle of [[Hayam Wuruk]] is mentioned in the charters of 1384\u201386. A mass Javanese immigration to Bali occurred in the next century when the [[Majapahit Empire]] fell in 1520.<ref name=indianized/>{{rp|234,240}} Bali's government then became an independent collection of Hindu kingdoms which led to a Balinese national identity and major enhancements in culture, arts, and economy.

It was the first expedition of a series of bi-annual fleets to the Moluccas, that throughout the 16th century usually traveled along the coasts of the Sunda Islands.

The Dutch government expanded its control across the Indonesian archipelago during the second half of the 19th century (see [[Dutch East Indies]]). Dutch political and economic control over Bali began in the 1840s on the island's north coast, when the Dutch pitted various competing Balinese realms against each other.<ref name=\"ctpqur\"/> In the late 1890s, struggles between Balinese kingdoms in the island's south were exploited by the Dutch to increase their control.\n\nIn June 1860, the famous Welsh naturalist, [[Alfred Russel Wallace]], travelled to Bali from Singapore, landing at [[Buleleng, Bali|Buleleng]] on the north coast of the island. Wallace's trip to Bali was instrumental in helping him devise his [[Wallace Line]] theory. The Wallace Line is a faunal boundary that runs through the strait between Bali and [[Lombok]]. It has been found to be a boundary between species. In his travel memoir ''[[The Malay Archipelago]],'' Wallace wrote of his experience in Bali, of which has strong mention of the [[Subak (irrigation)|unique Balinese irrigation methods]]:\n\n<blockquote>I was both astonished and delighted; for as my visit to Java was some years later, I had never beheld so beautiful and well-cultivated a district out of Europe. A slightly undulating plain extends from the seacoast about {{convert|10|or|12|mi|km|spell=in|abbr=off}} inland, where it is bounded by a fine range of wooded and cultivated hills. Houses and villages, marked out by dense clumps of [[coconut palms]], [[tamarind]] and other fruit trees, are dotted about in every direction; while between them extend luxurious rice-grounds, watered by an elaborate system of irrigation that would be the pride of the best cultivated parts of Europe.<ref>{{cite book|last=Wallace|first=Alfred Russel|title=The Malay Archipelago|year=1869|isbn=9780794605636|page=116}}</ref> </blockquote>\n\nThe Dutch mounted large naval and ground [[Dutch intervention in Bali (1906)|assaults at the Sanur region]] in 1906 and were met by the thousands of members of the royal family and their followers who rather than yield to the superior Dutch force committed ritual suicide (''[[puputan]]'') to avoid the humiliation of surrender.<ref name=\"ctpqur\" /> Despite Dutch demands for surrender, an estimated 200 Balinese killed themselves rather than surrender.<ref>[[#Haer|Haer]], p. 38.</ref> In the [[Dutch intervention in Bali (1908)|Dutch intervention in Bali]], a similar mass suicide occurred in the face of a Dutch assault in [[Klungkung]]. Afterward the Dutch governors exercised administrative control over the island, but local control over religion and culture generally remained intact. Dutch rule over Bali came later and was never as well established as in other parts of Indonesia such as Java and [[Maluku Islands|Maluku]].\n\nIn the 1930s, anthropologists [[Margaret Mead]] and [[Gregory Bateson]], artists [[Miguel Covarrubias]] and [[Walter Spies]], and musicologist [[Colin McPhee]] all spent time here. Their accounts of the island and its peoples created a western image of Bali as \"an enchanted land of [[aesthetes]] at peace with themselves and nature\".

It was not originally a target in their Netherlands East Indies Campaign, but as the airfields on [[Borneo]] were inoperative due to heavy rains, the [[Imperial Japanese Army]] decided to occupy Bali, which did not suffer from comparable weather. The island had no regular [[Royal Netherlands East Indies Army]] (KNIL) troops. There was only a Native Auxiliary Corps ''Prajoda'' (Korps Prajoda) consisting of about 600 native soldiers and several Dutch KNIL officers under the command of KNIL Lieutenant Colonel W.P. Roodenburg. On 19 February 1942 the Japanese forces landed near the town of Senoer [Senur].

Once the Japanese forces had been repatriated the island was handed over to the Dutch the following year.\n\nIn 1946, the Dutch constituted Bali as one of the 13 administrative districts of the newly proclaimed [[State of East Indonesia]], a rival state to the Republic of Indonesia, which was proclaimed and headed by [[Sukarno]] and [[Mohammad Hatta|Hatta]].

Mirroring the widening of social divisions across Indonesia in the 1950s and early 1960s, Bali saw conflict between supporters of the traditional [[caste system]], and those rejecting this system. Politically, the opposition was represented by supporters of the [[Indonesian Communist Party]] (PKI) and the [[Indonesian Nationalist Party]] (PNI), with tensions and ill-feeling further increased by the PKI's land reform programs.<ref name=\"ctpqur\" /> [[30 September Movement|An attempted coup]] in Jakarta was put down by forces led by General Suharto.\n\nThe army became the dominant power as it instigated [[Indonesian killings of 1965\u201366|a violent anti-communist purge]], in which the army blamed the PKI for the coup.

His [[New Order (Indonesia)|\"New Order\"]] government reestablished relations with western countries. The pre-War Bali as \"paradise\" was revived in a modern form.

Bali's volcanic nature has contributed to its exceptional fertility and its tall mountain ranges provide the high rainfall that supports the highly productive agriculture sector. South of the mountains is a broad, steadily descending area where most of Bali's large rice crop is grown. The northern side of the mountains slopes more steeply to the sea and is the main coffee-producing area of the island, along with rice, vegetables and cattle. The longest river, [[Ayung River]], flows approximately {{cvt|75|km|mi}} (see [[List of rivers of Bali]]).\n\nThe island is surrounded by [[coral reefs]].

Tourism further increased on Bali after the [[Ngurah Rai International Airport]] opened in 1970. The Buleleng regency government encouraged the tourism sector as one of the mainstays for economic progress and social welfare.\n\nThe [[tourism industry]] is primarily focused in the south, while also significant in the other parts of the island. The main tourist locations are the town of [[Kuta]] (with its beach), and its outer suburbs of [[Legian]] and [[Seminyak]] (which were once independent townships), the east coast town of [[Sanur (Bali)|Sanur]] (once the only tourist hub), [[Ubud]] towards the centre of the island, to the south of the [[Ngurah Rai International Airport]], [[Jimbaran]] and the newer developments of [[Nusa Dua]] and [[Pecatu]].\n\nThe United States government lifted its travel warnings in 2008.

Bali's real estate has been rapidly developing in the main tourist areas of Kuta, Legian, Seminyak and Oberoi. Most recently, high-end 5-star projects are under development on the Bukit peninsula, on the south side of the island. Expensive villas are being developed along the cliff sides of south Bali, with commanding panoramic ocean views. Foreign and domestic, many Jakarta individuals and companies are fairly active, investment into other areas of the island also continues to grow. Land prices, despite the worldwide economic crisis, have remained stable.\n\nIn the last half of 2008, Indonesia's currency had dropped approximately 30% against the US dollar, providing many overseas visitors improved value for their currencies.\n\nBali's tourism economy survived the [[Islamists]] terrorist bombings of 2002 and 2005, and the tourism industry has slowly recovered and surpassed its pre-terrorist bombing levels; the longterm trend has been a steady increase of visitor arrivals. In 2010, Bali received 2.57 million foreign tourists, which surpassed the target of 2.0\u20132.3 million tourists.

This influence strengthened the belief that the gods and goddesses are present in all things. Every element of nature, therefore, possesses its own power, which reflects the power of the gods. A rock, tree, dagger, or woven cloth is a potential home for spirits whose energy can be directed for good or evil. Balinese Hinduism is deeply interwoven with art and ritual. Ritualising states of self-control are a notable feature of religious expression among the people, who for this reason have become famous for their graceful and decorous behaviour.<ref>Slattum, J.

As a result, these Sino-Balinese not only embrace their original religion, which is a mixture of Buddhism, Christianity, Taoism and Confucianism, but also find a way to harmonise it with the local traditions. Hence, it is not uncommon to find local Sino-Balinese during the local temple's ''[[odalan]]''. Moreover, Balinese Hindu priests are invited to perform rites alongside a Chinese priest in the event of the death of a Sino-Balinese.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://voiceoftheshadows.blogspot.com/2009/04/short-post.html |title=Short Post |publisher=Voiceoftheshadows.blogspot.com |date=24 April 2009 |accessdate=30 December 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110708072104/http://voiceoftheshadows.blogspot.com/2009/04/short-post.html |archivedate=8 July 2011 }}</ref> Nevertheless, the Sino-Balinese claim to embrace Buddhism for administrative purposes, such as their Identity Cards.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://voiceoftheshadows.blogspot.com/2009/05/hectic-yet-void-week.html |title=Hectic, yet void, week |publisher=Voiceoftheshadows.blogspot.com |date=7 May 2009 |accessdate=30 December 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110708072220/http://voiceoftheshadows.blogspot.com/2009/05/hectic-yet-void-week.html |archivedate=8 July 2011 }}</ref>\n\n===Language===\n[[Balinese language|Balinese]] and [[Indonesian language|Indonesian]] are the most widely spoken languages in Bali, and the vast majority of [[Balinese people]] are [[bilingual]] or [[trilingual]]. The most common spoken language around the tourist areas is Indonesian, as many people in the tourist sector are not solely Balinese, but migrants from [[Java]], [[Lombok]], [[Sumatra]], and other parts of Indonesia. There are several indigenous Balinese languages, but most Balinese can also use the most widely spoken option: modern common Balinese. The usage of different Balinese languages was traditionally determined by the [[Balinese caste system]] and by clan membership, but this tradition is diminishing. [[Kawi language|Kawi]] and [[Sanskrit]] are also commonly used by some Hindu priests in Bali, as Hindu literature was mostly written in Sanskrit.\n\n[[English language|English]] and Chinese are the next most common languages (and the primary foreign languages) of many Balinese, owing to the requirements of the [[tourism industry]], as well as the English-speaking community and huge Chinese-Indonesian population. Other foreign languages, such as [[Japanese language|Japanese]], [[Korean language|Korean]], [[French language|French]], [[Russian language|Russian]] or [[German language|German]] are often used in multilingual signs for foreign tourists.\n\n==Culture==\n{{See also|Balinese art|Music of Bali|Balinese cuisine}}\n[[File:Kecak.JPG|thumb|left|A ''[[kecak]]'' dance being performed at [[Uluwatu Temple]], in Bali]]\n[[File:Bali-Danse 0729a.jpg|thumb|upright|Dancer, Bali, c. 2007]]\nBali is renowned for its diverse and sophisticated art forms, such as painting, sculpture, woodcarving, handcrafts, and performing arts. [[Balinese cuisine]] is also distinctive. Balinese percussion orchestra music, known as ''[[gamelan]]'', is highly developed and varied. Balinese performing arts often portray stories from Hindu epics such as the [[Ramayana]] but with heavy Balinese influence. Famous [[Balinese dance]]s include ''[[pendet]]'', ''[[legong]]'', ''[[baris (dance)|baris]]'', ''[[topeng]]'', ''[[barong (mythology)|barong]]'', ''[[Gamelan gong kebyar|gong keybar]]'', and ''[[kecak]]'' (the monkey dance).

On this day everyone stays at home and tourists are encouraged (or required) to remain in their hotels. On the day before New Year, large and colourful sculptures of ''[[Ogoh-ogoh]]'' monsters are paraded and finally burned in the evening to drive away evil spirits. Other festivals throughout the year are specified by the Balinese ''[[pawukon]]'' [[calendar|calendrical]] system.\n\nCelebrations are held for many occasions such as a tooth-filing (coming-of-age ritual), [[Ngaben|cremation]] or ''odalan'' (temple festival). One of the most important concepts that Balinese ceremonies have in common is that of ''d\u00e9sa kala patra'', which refers to how ritual performances must be appropriate in both the specific and general social context.<ref name=Herbst/> Many of the ceremonial art forms such as ''[[wayang|wayang kulit]]'' and ''[[topeng]]'' are highly improvisatory, providing flexibility for the performer to adapt the performance to the current situation.<ref name=Foley/> Many celebrations call for a loud, boisterous atmosphere with lots of activity and the resulting aesthetic, ''ram\u00e9'', is distinctively Balinese. Often two or more ''[[Music of Bali|gamelan]]'' ensembles will be performing well within earshot, and sometimes compete with each other to be heard. Likewise, the audience members talk amongst themselves, get up and walk around, or even cheer on the performance, which adds to the many layers of activity and the liveliness typical of ''ram\u00e9''.<ref>[[#Gold|Gold]], p. 8.</ref>\n\n[[File:Ubud Cremation 4.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Ngaben|Cremation]] in [[Ubud]]]]\n''Kaja'' and ''kelod'' are the Balinese equivalents of North and South, which refer to ones orientation between the island's largest mountain Gunung Agung (''kaja''), and the sea (''kelod''). In addition to spatial orientation, ''kaja'' and ''kelod'' have the connotation of good and evil; gods and ancestors are believed to live on the mountain whereas demons live in the sea. Buildings such as temples and residential homes are spatially oriented by having the most sacred spaces closest to the mountain and the unclean places nearest to the sea.<ref name=Herbst/><ref>[[#Gold|Gold]], p. 19.</ref>\n\nMost temples have an inner courtyard and an outer courtyard which are arranged with the inner courtyard furthest ''kaja''. These spaces serve as performance venues since most Balinese rituals are accompanied by any combination of music, dance and drama. The performances that take place in the inner courtyard are classified as ''wali'', the most sacred rituals which are offerings exclusively for the gods, while the outer courtyard is where ''bebali'' ceremonies are held, which are intended for gods and people. Lastly, performances meant solely for the entertainment of humans take place outside the walls of the temple and are called ''bali-balihan''. This three-tiered system of classification was standardised in 1971 by a committee of Balinese officials and artists to better protect the sanctity of the oldest and most sacred Balinese rituals from being performed for a paying audience.<ref>[[#Gold|Gold]], pp.&nbsp;18\u201326.</ref>\n\n[[File:A collage of scenes from Barong dance of Bali Indonesia.jpg|thumb|left|Barong dance]]\nTourism, Bali's chief industry, has provided the island with a foreign audience that is eager to pay for entertainment, thus creating new performance opportunities and more demand for performers. The impact of [[tourism in indonesia|tourism]] is controversial since before it became integrated into the economy, the Balinese performing arts did not exist as a capitalist venture, and were not performed for entertainment outside of their respective ritual context. Since the 1930s sacred rituals such as the ''[[barong (mythology)|barong]]'' [[Balinese dance|dance]] have been performed both in their original contexts, as well as exclusively for paying tourists. This has led to new versions of many of these performances which have developed according to the preferences of foreign audiences; some villages have a ''barong'' mask specifically for non-ritual performances as well as an older mask which is only used for sacred performances.<ref name=Sanger/>\n\nBalinese society continues to revolve around each family's ancestral village, to which the cycle of life and religion is closely tied.<ref name=\"NYT\">{{cite news|last=Belford|first=Aubrey|title=Customary Law Revival Neglects Some Balinese|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/13/world/asia/13iht-bali.html|accessdate=12 October 2010|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=12 October 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20130207064353/http://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/13/world/asia/13iht-bali.html| archivedate=7 February 2013<!-- Bot retrieved archive -->| url-status=live}}</ref> Coercive aspects of traditional society, such as [[customary law]] sanctions imposed by traditional authorities such as village councils (including \"[[kasepekang]]\", or [[shunning]]) have risen in importance as a consequence of the democratisation and decentralisation of Indonesia since 1998.<ref name=\"NYT\" />\n\nOther than Balinese sacred rituals and festivals, the government presents [[Bali Arts Festival]] to showcase Bali's performing arts and various artworks produced by the local talents that they have.

The name ''Bali dwipa'' (\"Bali island\") has been discovered from various inscriptions, including the Blanjong pillar inscription written by [[Sri Kesari Warmadewa]] in 914 AD and mentioning '''Walidwipa'''. It was during this time that the people developed their complex irrigation system ''[[Subak (irrigation)|subak]]'' to grow rice in [[wet-field cultivation]]. Some religious and cultural traditions still practiced today can be traced to this period.\n\nThe Hindu [[Majapahit Empire]] (1293\u20131520 AD) on eastern [[Java (island)|Java]] founded a Balinese colony in 1343.

The Dutch government expanded its control across the Indonesian archipelago during the second half of the 19th century (see [[Dutch East Indies]]). Dutch political and economic control over Bali began in the 1840s on the island's north coast, when the Dutch pitted various competing Balinese realms against each other.<ref name=\"ctpqur\"/> In the late 1890s, struggles between Balinese kingdoms in the island's south were exploited by the Dutch to increase their control.\n\nIn June 1860, the famous Welsh naturalist, [[Alfred Russel Wallace]], travelled to Bali from Singapore, landing at [[Buleleng, Bali|Buleleng]] on the north coast of the island. Wallace's trip to Bali was instrumental in helping him devise his [[Wallace Line]] theory. The Wallace Line is a faunal boundary that runs through the strait between Bali and [[Lombok]]. It has been found to be a boundary between species. In his travel memoir ''[[The Malay Archipelago]],'' Wallace wrote of his experience in Bali, of which has strong mention of the [[Subak (irrigation)|unique Balinese irrigation methods]]:\n\n<blockquote>I was both astonished and delighted; for as my visit to Java was some years later, I had never beheld so beautiful and well-cultivated a district out of Europe.

The island had no regular [[Royal Netherlands East Indies Army]] (KNIL) troops. There was only a Native Auxiliary Corps ''Prajoda'' (Korps Prajoda) consisting of about 600 native soldiers and several Dutch KNIL officers under the command of KNIL Lieutenant Colonel W.P.

This influence strengthened the belief that the gods and goddesses are present in all things. Every element of nature, therefore, possesses its own power, which reflects the power of the gods. A rock, tree, dagger, or woven cloth is a potential home for spirits whose energy can be directed for good or evil. Balinese Hinduism is deeply interwoven with art and ritual. Ritualising states of self-control are a notable feature of religious expression among the people, who for this reason have become famous for their graceful and decorous behaviour.<ref>Slattum, J.

As a result, these Sino-Balinese not only embrace their original religion, which is a mixture of Buddhism, Christianity, Taoism and Confucianism, but also find a way to harmonise it with the local traditions. Hence, it is not uncommon to find local Sino-Balinese during the local temple's ''[[odalan]]''.

The most common spoken language around the tourist areas is Indonesian, as many people in the tourist sector are not solely Balinese, but migrants from [[Java]], [[Lombok]], [[Sumatra]], and other parts of Indonesia. There are several indigenous Balinese languages, but most Balinese can also use the most widely spoken option: modern common Balinese. The usage of different Balinese languages was traditionally determined by the [[Balinese caste system]] and by clan membership, but this tradition is diminishing. [[Kawi language|Kawi]] and [[Sanskrit]] are also commonly used by some Hindu priests in Bali, as Hindu literature was mostly written in Sanskrit.\n\n[[English language|English]] and Chinese are the next most common languages (and the primary foreign languages) of many Balinese, owing to the requirements of the [[tourism industry]], as well as the English-speaking community and huge Chinese-Indonesian population. Other foreign languages, such as [[Japanese language|Japanese]], [[Korean language|Korean]], [[French language|French]], [[Russian language|Russian]] or [[German language|German]] are often used in multilingual signs for foreign tourists.\n\n==Culture==\n{{See also|Balinese art|Music of Bali|Balinese cuisine}}\n[[File:Kecak.JPG|thumb|left|A ''[[kecak]]'' dance being performed at [[Uluwatu Temple]], in Bali]]\n[[File:Bali-Danse 0729a.jpg|thumb|upright|Dancer, Bali, c. 2007]]\nBali is renowned for its diverse and sophisticated art forms, such as painting, sculpture, woodcarving, handcrafts, and performing arts. [[Balinese cuisine]] is also distinctive. Balinese percussion orchestra music, known as ''[[gamelan]]'', is highly developed and varied. Balinese performing arts often portray stories from Hindu epics such as the [[Ramayana]] but with heavy Balinese influence. Famous [[Balinese dance]]s include ''[[pendet]]'', ''[[legong]]'', ''[[baris (dance)|baris]]'', ''[[topeng]]'', ''[[barong (mythology)|barong]]'', ''[[Gamelan gong kebyar|gong keybar]]'', and ''[[kecak]]'' (the monkey dance).

On this day everyone stays at home and tourists are encouraged (or required) to remain in their hotels. On the day before New Year, large and colourful sculptures of ''[[Ogoh-ogoh]]'' monsters are paraded and finally burned in the evening to drive away evil spirits. Other festivals throughout the year are specified by the Balinese ''[[pawukon]]'' [[calendar|calendrical]] system.\n\nCelebrations are held for many occasions such as a tooth-filing (coming-of-age ritual), [[Ngaben|cremation]] or ''odalan'' (temple festival). One of the most important concepts that Balinese ceremonies have in common is that of ''d\u00e9sa kala patra'', which refers to how ritual performances must be appropriate in both the specific and general social context.<ref name=Herbst/> Many of the ceremonial art forms such as ''[[wayang|wayang kulit]]'' and ''[[topeng]]'' are highly improvisatory, providing flexibility for the performer to adapt the performance to the current situation.<ref name=Foley/> Many celebrations call for a loud, boisterous atmosphere with lots of activity and the resulting aesthetic, ''ram\u00e9'', is distinctively Balinese. Often two or more ''[[Music of Bali|gamelan]]'' ensembles will be performing well within earshot, and sometimes compete with each other to be heard. Likewise, the audience members talk amongst themselves, get up and walk around, or even cheer on the performance, which adds to the many layers of activity and the liveliness typical of ''ram\u00e9''.<ref>[[#Gold|Gold]], p. 8.</ref>\n\n[[File:Ubud Cremation 4.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Ngaben|Cremation]] in [[Ubud]]]]\n''Kaja'' and ''kelod'' are the Balinese equivalents of North and South, which refer to ones orientation between the island's largest mountain Gunung Agung (''kaja''), and the sea (''kelod''). In addition to spatial orientation, ''kaja'' and ''kelod'' have the connotation of good and evil; gods and ancestors are believed to live on the mountain whereas demons live in the sea. Buildings such as temples and residential homes are spatially oriented by having the most sacred spaces closest to the mountain and the unclean places nearest to the sea.<ref name=Herbst/><ref>[[#Gold|Gold]], p. 19.</ref>\n\nMost temples have an inner courtyard and an outer courtyard which are arranged with the inner courtyard furthest ''kaja''. These spaces serve as performance venues since most Balinese rituals are accompanied by any combination of music, dance and drama. The performances that take place in the inner courtyard are classified as ''wali'', the most sacred rituals which are offerings exclusively for the gods, while the outer courtyard is where ''bebali'' ceremonies are held, which are intended for gods and people. Lastly, performances meant solely for the entertainment of humans take place outside the walls of the temple and are called ''bali-balihan''. This three-tiered system of classification was standardised in 1971 by a committee of Balinese officials and artists to better protect the sanctity of the oldest and most sacred Balinese rituals from being performed for a paying audience.<ref>[[#Gold|Gold]], pp.&nbsp;18\u201326.</ref>\n\n[[File:A collage of scenes from Barong dance of Bali Indonesia.jpg|thumb|left|Barong dance]]\nTourism, Bali's chief industry, has provided the island with a foreign audience that is eager to pay for entertainment, thus creating new performance opportunities and more demand for performers. The impact of [[tourism in indonesia|tourism]] is controversial since before it became integrated into the economy, the Balinese performing arts did not exist as a capitalist venture, and were not performed for entertainment outside of their respective ritual context. Since the 1930s sacred rituals such as the ''[[barong (mythology)|barong]]'' [[Balinese dance|dance]] have been performed both in their original contexts, as well as exclusively for paying tourists. This has led to new versions of many of these performances which have developed according to the preferences of foreign audiences; some villages have a ''barong'' mask specifically for non-ritual performances as well as an older mask which is only used for sacred performances.<ref name=Sanger/>\n\nBalinese society continues to revolve around each family's ancestral village, to which the cycle of life and religion is closely tied.<ref name=\"NYT\">{{cite news|last=Belford|first=Aubrey|title=Customary Law Revival Neglects Some Balinese|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/13/world/asia/13iht-bali.html|accessdate=12 October 2010|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=12 October 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20130207064353/http://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/13/world/asia/13iht-bali.html| archivedate=7 February 2013<!-- Bot retrieved archive -->| url-status=live}}</ref> Coercive aspects of traditional society, such as [[customary law]] sanctions imposed by traditional authorities such as village councils (including \"[[kasepekang]]\", or [[shunning]]) have risen in importance as a consequence of the democratisation and decentralisation of Indonesia since 1998.<ref name=\"NYT\" />\n\nOther than Balinese sacred rituals and festivals, the government presents [[Bali Arts Festival]] to showcase Bali's performing arts and various artworks produced by the local talents that they have.

The saints\u2019 lives, or biographies, in the breviary were all written by either Elphinstone or Boece.<ref name=\"Aberdeen\"/>\n\nBoece once noted that Elphinstone collected legends of saints from every [[diocese]] in Scotland, including both national heroes and local saints. He also noted that Elphinstone devoted time to the study of ancient Scottish histories, especially in the [[Outer Hebrides|Western Isles]], where \u201ctombs of the ancient kings\u201d lie. In addition, some material, such as ''Lessons for St. [[Cuthbert]],'' came from the writings of [[Bede]]. Some of the collected materials were included verbatim in the breviary, and some were re-written.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Boardman|first1=Steve|last2=Williamson|first2=Ella|title=The Cult of Saints and the Virgin Mary in Medieval Scotland|date=2010|publisher=Boydell|location=Woodbridge|isbn=9781843835622|pages=146\u201349|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1C0H9AWAU2IC&pg=PA143&lpg=PA143&dq=MacQuarrie,+Alan,+%E2%80%9CScottish+saints'+legends+in+the+Aberdeen+breviary&source=bl&ots=VDLc6zk4ZL&sig=nWMDHOMCShzBJFS5bhms8d7XSfM&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjyttCpmPHUAhVL3IMKHWesAYEQ6AEITzAH#v=onepage&q=MacQuarrie%2C%20Alan%2C%20%E2%80%9CScottish%20saints'%20legends%20in%20the%20Aberdeen%20breviary&f=false|accessdate=5 July 2017}}</ref>\n\nHowever, unlike the Sarum Rite, the Aberdeen work also contained lives of the nation's saints\u2014[[List of saints of Scotland|Scottish saints]] such as [[Saint Mungo|Kentigern]], [[Saint Machar|Machar]], and [[Saint Margaret of Scotland|Margaret of Scotland]]. Indeed, historian Jane Geddes has gone so far as to call the Aberdeen Breviary a work of \u201creligious patriotism,\u201d pointing out Scotland's sixteenth-century efforts to establish its own identity. She writes that both Elphinstone and the king \u201cwere attempting to direct the apparently growing interest in local cults . . . . toward a range of saints that they identified as Scottish.\u201d<ref>{{cite book|last1=Geddes|title=Medieval Art|page=241}}</ref>\n\nAlong with focusing on Scottish saints, Elphinstone sometimes \u201cScotticized\u201d [[Ireland|Irish]] and [[Europe|continental]] saints, one of the most interesting being the office of a [[France|French]] saint named [[Saint Fiacre|Fiacre]]. Historian Steve Boardman speculates Fiacre appealed to the Scots because of their long-standing hatred of the English in that the French saint was associated with the death of England's despised [[Henry V of England|Henry V]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Boardman|title=Cult of Saints|page=150}}</ref> It seems that after the [[Battle of Agincourt]], Henry had allowed his army to pillage Fiacre's [[shrine]], but Fiacre supernaturally prevented the English from carrying them beyond the boundaries of his [[monastery]]. But that is not all: Henry V died of [[hemorrhoid]]s on August 30, St. Fiacre's [[Calendar of saints|feast day]].<ref>{{cite web|title=St. Fiacre of Breuil, & Kilfiachra (Ireland)|url=http://celticsaints.org/2014/0829a.html|website=Celtic and Old English Saints|accessdate=5 July 2017}}</ref>\n\nBoardman points out, however, that there are a few cases in which Elphinstone and Boece included saints associated with Scotland, but introduced as otherwise. One example is St. [[Constantine the Great]], for whom there were dedicated places of worship in Scotland\u2014at [[Kilchousland Chapel|Kilchousland]] in [[Kintyre]] and at [[Govan]]\u2014and whom [[Glasgow]] even claimed as a native son.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Boardman|title=Cult of Saints|page=149}}</ref>\n\nThe breviary, which was composed in Latin, includes at the back a small, 16-page book entitled ''Compassio Beate Marie'', which has readings about the relics of [[Andrew the Apostle|St. Andrew]], Scotland's [[patron saint]].<ref name=\"Glamis\"/> In addition, at the end of each volume were the ''Propria Sanctorum'', containing prayers and readings to be used only on the feast day of the particular saint.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Boardman|title=Cult of Saints|page=143}}</ref> [[Hymn]]s, [[Responsory|responsories]], and [[antiphon]]s were composed for most of the saints in various [[Metre (music)|metres]] and styles.

Since Scotland had no [[printing press]] at that time, booksellers [[Walter Chepman]] and [[Androw Myllar]] of [[Edinburgh]] were commissioned to \u201cbring home a printing press\u201d primarily for that purpose.<ref name=\"Glamis\">{{cite web|title=Glamis Copy of Aberdeen Breviary - a Significan Addition|url=https://www.nls.uk/news/archive/2014/09/aberdeen-breviary|website=National Library of Scotland|accessdate=5 July 2017}}</ref>\n\nTo create the breviary itself, James sought out [[William Elphinstone]], [[Bishop of Aberdeen]], who had received the king's permission to establish the [[University of Aberdeen]] twelve years before.<ref>{{cite web|title=Bishop William Elphinstone|url=http://www.undiscoveredscotland.co.uk/usbiography/e/williamelphinstone.html|website=Undiscovered Scotland|accessdate=5 July 2017}}</ref> To help him with the undertaking, Elphinstone, in turn, tapped the man who had helped him found the university, Scottish philosopher and historian [[Hector Boece]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Geddes|first1=Jane|title=Medieval Art, Architecture and Archaeology in the Dioceses of Aberdeen and Moray|date=2016|publisher=Routledge|location=London|isbn=978-1138640689|page=143|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uFb7CwAAQBAJ&pg=PA240&lpg=PA240&dq=Aberdeen+Breviary&source=bl&ots=7fY5ToINUX&sig=stXCcpVP2lmiSNNE1SNpzIfMSU0&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjDg-6_o_HUAhVj5oMKHS5IA_Y4ChDoAQhIMAg#v=onepage&q=scotticized&f=false|accessdate=5 July 2017}}</ref> The two began their work in 1509, and the first copy, produced as a small [[octavo]], came off the press in 1510.<ref name=\"Aberdeen\">{{cite web|title=The Aberdeen Breviary|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02777a.htm|website=Catholic Encyclopedia|publisher=New Advent|accessdate=5 July 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Contents==\nLike the Sarum Rite, which had been in use since the twelfth century, the Aberdeen Breviary contained brief lives, or biographies, of the saints as well as the [[liturgy]] and [[canonical hours]] which were to conform to [[Catholic Church|Roman practice]] and serve as the standard of [[Christianity|Christian]] worship throughout the country. The saints\u2019 lives, or biographies, in the breviary were all written by either Elphinstone or Boece.<ref name=\"Aberdeen\"/>\n\nBoece once noted that Elphinstone collected legends of saints from every [[diocese]] in Scotland, including both national heroes and local saints. He also noted that Elphinstone devoted time to the study of ancient Scottish histories, especially in the [[Outer Hebrides|Western Isles]], where \u201ctombs of the ancient kings\u201d lie. In addition, some material, such as ''Lessons for St. [[Cuthbert]],'' came from the writings of [[Bede]]. Some of the collected materials were included verbatim in the breviary, and some were re-written.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Boardman|first1=Steve|last2=Williamson|first2=Ella|title=The Cult of Saints and the Virgin Mary in Medieval Scotland|date=2010|publisher=Boydell|location=Woodbridge|isbn=9781843835622|pages=146\u201349|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1C0H9AWAU2IC&pg=PA143&lpg=PA143&dq=MacQuarrie,+Alan,+%E2%80%9CScottish+saints'+legends+in+the+Aberdeen+breviary&source=bl&ots=VDLc6zk4ZL&sig=nWMDHOMCShzBJFS5bhms8d7XSfM&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjyttCpmPHUAhVL3IMKHWesAYEQ6AEITzAH#v=onepage&q=MacQuarrie%2C%20Alan%2C%20%E2%80%9CScottish%20saints'%20legends%20in%20the%20Aberdeen%20breviary&f=false|accessdate=5 July 2017}}</ref>\n\nHowever, unlike the Sarum Rite, the Aberdeen work also contained lives of the nation's saints\u2014[[List of saints of Scotland|Scottish saints]] such as [[Saint Mungo|Kentigern]], [[Saint Machar|Machar]], and [[Saint Margaret of Scotland|Margaret of Scotland]]. Indeed, historian Jane Geddes has gone so far as to call the Aberdeen Breviary a work of \u201creligious patriotism,\u201d pointing out Scotland's sixteenth-century efforts to establish its own identity. She writes that both Elphinstone and the king \u201cwere attempting to direct the apparently growing interest in local cults . . . . toward a range of saints that they identified as Scottish.\u201d<ref>{{cite book|last1=Geddes|title=Medieval Art|page=241}}</ref>\n\nAlong with focusing on Scottish saints, Elphinstone sometimes \u201cScotticized\u201d [[Ireland|Irish]] and [[Europe|continental]] saints, one of the most interesting being the office of a [[France|French]] saint named [[Saint Fiacre|Fiacre]]. Historian Steve Boardman speculates Fiacre appealed to the Scots because of their long-standing hatred of the English in that the French saint was associated with the death of England's despised [[Henry V of England|Henry V]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Boardman|title=Cult of Saints|page=150}}</ref> It seems that after the [[Battle of Agincourt]], Henry had allowed his army to pillage Fiacre's [[shrine]], but Fiacre supernaturally prevented the English from carrying them beyond the boundaries of his [[monastery]]. But that is not all: Henry V died of [[hemorrhoid]]s on August 30, St. Fiacre's [[Calendar of saints|feast day]].<ref>{{cite web|title=St. Fiacre of Breuil, & Kilfiachra (Ireland)|url=http://celticsaints.org/2014/0829a.html|website=Celtic and Old English Saints|accessdate=5 July 2017}}</ref>\n\nBoardman points out, however, that there are a few cases in which Elphinstone and Boece included saints associated with Scotland, but introduced as otherwise. One example is St. [[Constantine the Great]], for whom there were dedicated places of worship in Scotland\u2014at [[Kilchousland Chapel|Kilchousland]] in [[Kintyre]] and at [[Govan]]\u2014and whom [[Glasgow]] even claimed as a native son.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Boardman|title=Cult of Saints|page=149}}</ref>\n\nThe breviary, which was composed in Latin, includes at the back a small, 16-page book entitled ''Compassio Beate Marie'', which has readings about the relics of [[Andrew the Apostle|St. Andrew]], Scotland's [[patron saint]].<ref name=\"Glamis\"/> In addition, at the end of each volume were the ''Propria Sanctorum'', containing prayers and readings to be used only on the feast day of the particular saint.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Boardman|title=Cult of Saints|page=143}}</ref> [[Hymn]]s, [[Responsory|responsories]], and [[antiphon]]s were composed for most of the saints in various [[Metre (music)|metres]] and styles. There are [[poetry|poems]] as well, although, except for the poem for the office of St. Fiacre, they are not high in quality. All these were to be used as acts of [[worship]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Boardman|title=Cult of Saints|pages=151\u201352}}</ref>\n\n==Extant copies==\nOnly four copies of the Aberdeen Breviary are extant: one in the [[University of Edinburgh]]; one in the Library of the [[Faculty of Advocates]], Edinburgh; one in the library of [[King's College, Aberdeen]]; and one recently purchased by the [[National Library of Scotland]] from the private collection of the [[Earl of Strathmore and Kinghorne|Earl of Strathmore]] in [[Glamis]], [[Angus, Scotland|Angus]].<ref name=\"Aberdeen\"/><ref name=\"Glamis\"/>\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [https://archive.org/details/breviariumaber9603cathuoft Digital text]\n\n[[Category:16th century in Scotland]]\n[[Category:History of Catholicism in Scotland]]\n[[Category:Scottish books]]\n[[Category:Breviaries]]\n[[Category:16th-century Christianity]]\n", "name_user": "Johnsoniensis", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eOrigin:> Significant Addition", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aberdeen_Breviary"}

Despite subtle differences in the categorizing of [[fairy tale]]s, [[folklore]], [[fable]]s, [[Mythology|myths]], and [[legend]]s, a modern definition of the fairy tale, as provided by Jens Tismar's monologue in German, is a story that differs \"from an oral folk tale\", written by \"a single identifiable author\", which can be characterised as \"simple and anonymous\", and exists in a mutable and difficult to define genre with a close relationship to [[Oral tradition|folktale]]s.{{sfnp|Zipes|2000|p=xv}}\n\n{| class=wikitable style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; border: none; background: #bdfbc9;\"\n|-style=\"height: 3em;\"\n| align=center|&nbsp; '''Go to:''' \n{{flatlist|\n* [[#Africa|Africa]] &nbsp; \n* [[#Arabic|Arabia]] &nbsp; \n* [[#Armenia|Armenia]] &nbsp; \n* [[#Australia|Australia]] &nbsp; \n* [[#Slavic|Bohemia]] &nbsp;\n* [[#France|Brittany]] &nbsp;\n* [[#Slavic|Bukovina]] &nbsp;\n* [[#Slavic|Bulgaria]] &nbsp; \n* [[#Iberia|Catalonia]] &nbsp; \n* [[#Celtic|Celtic]] &nbsp; \n* [[#China|China]] &nbsp; \n* [[#Slavic|Czech]]<!--Bohemia--> &nbsp;\n* [[#Scandinavia|Denmark]] &nbsp; \n* [[#England|England]] &nbsp; \n* [[#Baltic|Estonia]] &nbsp; \n* [[#Finland|Finland]] &nbsp;\n* [[#France|France]] &nbsp; \n* [[#Germany|Germany]] &nbsp; \n* [[#Greece|Greece]] &nbsp; \n* [[#Hungary|Greece]] &nbsp; \n* [[#Scandinavia|Iceland]] &nbsp; \n* [[#India|India]] &nbsp; \n* [[#Ireland|Ireland]] &nbsp;\n* [[#Isle of Man|Isle of Man]] &nbsp;\n* [[#Italy|Italy]] &nbsp; \n* [[#Japan|Japan]] &nbsp; \n* [[#Korea|Korea]] &nbsp; \n* [[#Baltic|Lithuania]] &nbsp; \n* [[#Nepal|Nepal]] &nbsp; \n* [[#New Zealand|New Zealand]] &nbsp; \n* [[#Scandinavia|Norway]] &nbsp; \n* [[#Arabic|Persia]] &nbsp; \n* [[#Iberia|Portugal]] &nbsp;\n* [[#Slavic|Romania]] &nbsp;\n* [[#Russia|Russia]] &nbsp; \n* [[#Finland|Sami]] &nbsp;\n* [[#Scandinavia|Scandinavia]] &nbsp; \n* [[#Slavic|Slavic areas]] &nbsp;\n* [[#Scandinavia|Slovak]] &nbsp; \n* [[#Scandinavia|Sweden]] &nbsp; \n* [[#Scotland|Scotland]] &nbsp; \n* [[#Slavic|Serbia]] &nbsp;\n* [[#Iberia|Spain]] &nbsp;\n* [[#Turkey|Turkey ]] &nbsp;\n* [[#United States|United States mainland]] &nbsp; \n* [[#Vietnam|Vietnam]] &nbsp; \n* [[#Wales|Wales]] &nbsp; \n* [[#Bibliography|Bibliography]] &nbsp; \n* [[#External links|External links]] &nbsp; \n}}\n|}\n<!-- New additions: Please update index at top also\n== XXX ==\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" | Name\n! scope=\"col\" | Date\n! scope=\"col\" | Region\n! scope=\"col\" | Author\n! scope=\"col\" | Book or collection\n! scope=\"col\" | Type\n|}-->\n\n==Non-categorized==\n{{hatnote|section=yes|This section is about tales that cannot be localized to a specific region.}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" | Name\n! scope=\"col\" | Date\n! scope=\"col\" | Region\n! scope=\"col\" | Author\n! scope=\"col\" | Book or collection\n! scope=\"col\" | Type\n|-\n! {{sortname|The|Blue Mountains|The Blue Mountains (fairy tale)}}  \n|1894 \n| \n| \n| \n|N/A\n|-\n!

Despite subtle differences in the categorizing of [[fairy tale]]s, [[folklore]], [[fable]]s, [[Mythology|myths]], and [[legend]]s, a modern definition of the fairy tale, as provided by Jens Tismar's monologue in German, is a story that differs \"from an oral folk tale\", written by \"a single identifiable author\", which can be characterised as \"simple and anonymous\", and exists in a mutable and difficult to define genre with a close relationship to [[Oral tradition|folktale]]s.{{sfnp|Zipes|2000|p=xv}}\n\n{| class=wikitable style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; border: none; background: #bdfbc9;\"\n|-style=\"height: 3em;\"\n| align=center|&nbsp; '''Go to:''' \n{{flatlist|\n* [[#Africa|Africa]] &nbsp; \n* [[#Arabic|Arabia]] &nbsp; \n* [[#Armenia|Armenia]] &nbsp; \n* [[#Australia|Australia]] &nbsp; \n* [[#Slavic|Bohemia]] &nbsp;\n* [[#France|Brittany]] &nbsp;\n* [[#Slavic|Bukovina]] &nbsp;\n* [[#Slavic|Bulgaria]] &nbsp; \n* [[#Iberia|Catalonia]] &nbsp; \n* [[#Celtic|Celtic]] &nbsp; \n* [[#China|China]] &nbsp; \n* [[#Slavic|Czech]]<!--Bohemia--> &nbsp;\n* [[#Scandinavia|Denmark]] &nbsp; \n* [[#England|England]] &nbsp; \n* [[#Baltic|Estonia]] &nbsp; \n* [[#Finland|Finland]] &nbsp;\n* [[#France|France]] &nbsp; \n* [[#Germany|Germany]] &nbsp; \n* [[#Greece|Greece]] &nbsp; \n* [[#Hungary|Greece]] &nbsp; \n* [[#Scandinavia|Iceland]] &nbsp; \n* [[#India|India]] &nbsp; \n* [[#Ireland|Ireland]] &nbsp;\n* [[#Isle of Man|Isle of Man]] &nbsp;\n* [[#Italy|Italy]] &nbsp; \n* [[#Japan|Japan]] &nbsp; \n* [[#Korea|Korea]] &nbsp; \n* [[#Baltic|Lithuania]] &nbsp; \n* [[#Nepal|Nepal]] &nbsp; \n* [[#New Zealand|New Zealand]] &nbsp; \n* [[#Scandinavia|Norway]] &nbsp; \n* [[#Arabic|Persia]] &nbsp; \n* [[#Iberia|Portugal]] &nbsp;\n* [[#Slavic|Romania]] &nbsp;\n* [[#Russia|Russia]] &nbsp; \n* [[#Finland|Sami]] &nbsp;\n* [[#Scandinavia|Scandinavia]] &nbsp; \n* [[#Slavic|Slavic areas]] &nbsp;\n* [[#Scandinavia|Slovak]] &nbsp; \n* [[#Scandinavia|Sweden]] &nbsp; \n* [[#Scotland|Scotland]] &nbsp; \n* [[#Slavic|Serbia]] &nbsp;\n* [[#Iberia|Spain]] &nbsp;\n* [[#Turkey|Turkey ]] &nbsp;\n* [[#United States|United States mainland]] &nbsp; \n* [[#Vietnam|Vietnam]] &nbsp; \n* [[#Wales|Wales]] &nbsp; \n* [[#Bibliography|Bibliography]] &nbsp; \n* [[#External links|External links]] &nbsp; \n}}\n|}\n<!-- New additions: Please update index at top also\n== XXX ==\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" | Name\n! scope=\"col\" | Date\n! scope=\"col\" | Region\n! scope=\"col\" | Author\n! scope=\"col\" | Book or collection\n! scope=\"col\" | Type\n|}-->\n\n==Non-categorized==\n{{hatnote|section=yes|This section is about tales that cannot be localized to a specific region.}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" | Name\n! scope=\"col\" | Date\n! scope=\"col\" | Region\n! scope=\"col\" | Author\n! scope=\"col\" | Book or collection\n! scope=\"col\" | Type\n|-\n! {{sortname|The|Blue Mountains|The Blue Mountains (fairy tale)}}  \n|1894 \n| \n| \n| \n|N/A\n|-\n!

In this case, mile-based exits 111A and 111B had been sequential exits 53CA and 53CB, as the 'OLD 53CA' tab shows.]]\n[[Image:I-4 west exit 58.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.64|On a road with distance-based exit numbering, the exit number (shown here on a [[gore (road)|gore]] sign) matches a nearby mile or kilometer marker.]]\n[[Image:Puerto_RICO_HGW.JPG|thumb|right|[[Puerto Rico]] is the only place in the United States that uses Spanish like the \"Salida 5B\" sign.]]\nAn '''exit number''' is a number assigned to a [[road junction]], usually an exit from a [[freeway]]. It is usually marked on the same sign as the destinations of the exit. In some countries, such as the United States,<ref name=mutcd/> it is also marked on a sign in the [[gore (road)|gore]].\n\nExit numbers typically reset at political borders such as [[U.S. state|state]] lines.<ref name=mutcd>{{Cite book |author = Federal Highway Administration |author2 = National Committee on Uniform Traffic Control Devices |last-author-amp = yes |date = May 2012 |chapter-url = https://mutcd.fhwa.dot.gov/htm/2009r1r2/part2/part2e.htm#section2E31 |chapter = Section 2E.31: Interchange Exit Numbering |title = Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices  |edition = Revised 2009 |location = Washington, DC |publisher = Federal Highway Administration |access-date = October 29, 2018|author-link = Federal Highway Administration |title-link = Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices }}</ref>\n\nSome non-[[freeway]]s use exit numbers. Typically these are rural roads built to [[Limited-access road|expressway]] standards{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}, and either only the actual exits are numbered, or the at-grade intersections are also numbered. An extreme case of this is in [[New York City]], where the [[Grand Concourse (Bronx)|Grand Concourse]] and [[Linden Boulevard]] were given sequential numbers, one per intersection (both boulevards no longer have exit numbers as of 2011). A milder version of this has been recently used on the [[West Side Highway]], also in New York, where only the major intersections are numbered (possibly to match the planned exits on the cancelled [[Westway (New York)|Westway]] freeway). Another case is the [[Nanaimo Parkway]] in [[Nanaimo, British Columbia]] carrying [[British Columbia Highway 19|Highway 19]], where all exits are numbered though all except one are at-grade intersections. Some other intersections on Highway 19 outside Nanaimo are also given numbers.\n\nAs a means of educating motorists, some [[state highway]] maps include a brief explanation of the exit numbering system on an inset. [[Iowa Department of Transportation|Iowa DOT]] maps from the 1980s and 1990s included a picture or drawing of a [[milestone|milepost]] and briefly described how Iowa had included milepost references near interchanges on the map.\n\n==Sequential numbers==\n[[Image:NJTP exit 8.JPG|thumb|left|The [[New Jersey Turnpike]], with its unusual exit signage, displaying exit 8. This interchange was opened in 1951.]]\n[[Image:NJTP exit 8A.JPG|thumb|left|The New Jersey Turnpike at exit 8A several miles north of exit 8. This interchange was opened in the 1970s, which is why the suffix exists.]]\nSequential exit numbering usually begins with exit 1 at the beginning of the road; each subsequent exit is given the next number. Letter suffixes are commonly used when new exits are added. For example, on the [[New York State Thruway]], an exit was added between 21 and 22, and was given the number 21A. Subsequently, a new exit was added between 21 and 21A, leading to the sequence 21 - 21B - 21A - 22. In [[Florida]], some new exits got the suffix C, so that if it had or acquired separate exits for the two directions, they would be 15CA and 15CB rather than 15AB. There are also occurrences of this happening on the New Jersey Turnpike; the original interchanges opened in 1951, with newer exits as recently as 1982. On the [[Baltimore Beltway]], there is an exit 12B-C ([[Maryland Route 372|MD 372]]), as well as 12A ([[U.S. Route 1 in Maryland|US 1]]). There is also an exit 8A ([[Interstate 895 (Maryland)|I-895]]) and an exit 8 ([[Maryland Route 168|MD 168]]).\n\nSome sequential exits are renumbered (remaining sequential) due to added exits. For instance, the [[Hutchinson River Parkway]] in [[New York (state)|New York]] was renumbered so that its northernmost exit, 27, became 30. However, the [[Merritt Parkway]], which continued the Hutchinson's exit numbers in [[Connecticut]], was not renumbered. This means the [[New York State Route 120A|Route 120A]] interchange is numbered 27 in Connecticut ''and'' 30 in New York.\n\nThe [[Atlantic City-Brigantine Connector]] in [[Atlantic City, New Jersey]] uses letters (without numbers) for its exits; it has many exits in a short distance, and the [[South Jersey Transportation Authority]] may have wanted to avoid numbers, as the Atlantic City Expressway's lowest numbers (mile-based) are in Atlantic City.\n\n==Distance-based numbers==<!-- This section is linked from [[Distance]] -->\n[[Image:Quebec exit number.jpg|thumb|right|An exit sign (kilometer-based) on [[Quebec Autoroute 640]] in Quebec]]\n[[Image:Quebec exit gore sign.jpg|thumb|upright=0.505|An exit gore sign on [[Quebec Autoroute 35]] in Quebec]]\nAs more highways were built, states and countries began to experiment with '''distance-based''' ('''mile-based''' or '''kilometer-based''') exit numbers. The first mile-based system known was implemented on the Garden State Parkway in New Jersey in the late 1950s. Michigan also implemented mile-based junction numbers on [[Interstate 94 in Michigan|Interstate 94]] in the 1960s. In this system, the number of miles from the beginning of the highway to the exit is used for the exit number. If two exits would end up with the same number, the numbers are sometimes modified slightly; this is often impossible and exits are given sequential or directional suffixes, just as with sequential numbers.\n\nAn exit can be numbered by where the exit in the direction of increased mileage leaves the freeway, or by where the road that the exit serves crosses the freeway (which is occasionally ambiguous). From this number, the [[integer]] exit number can be determined by rounding up, rounding down, or rounding to the nearest integer. Many jurisdictions prefer to avoid an exit 0.{{Citation needed|date=December 2014}} To this end, the numbers are either rounded up to get the exit number, or any exit that would get the number 0 is instead numbered 1. Examples of highways with an exit 0 are [[British Columbia Highway 1]] on the mainland, [[Interstate 70 in West Virginia|Interstate 70]] in [[Wheeling, West Virginia]], along the West Virginia\u2013Ohio border, and [[Interstate 90 in Montana|Interstate 90]] on the Montana side of the Idaho\u2013Montana border.<!--three examples are sufficient. this is NOT an exhaustive list; rather it is just an illustrative one.-->\n\nSome freeways' exit number starts from an advanced number (i.e. higher than 1). One reason for starting with a number higher than 1 is that the maintaining agency expects that the highway will be extended. For example, [[Ontario Highway 400]] starts at 20 because it was expected that the southern end of the highway would extend to downtown Toronto (which was never built). Another reason to use a higher number is that the freeway is branching off from another freeway. An example is [[British Columbia Highway 5]], which branches off [[British Columbia Highway 1]] and starts at 170.\n\nIn areas that use the [[metric system]], distance-based numbers are by kilometer rather than mile. A few highways, such as [[Delaware Route 1]] and [[Interstate 19]], have kilometer-based exit numbers, even in areas that typically use miles.\n\n==Exit numbers by country==\n\n===Australia===\nDistance-based exit numbering is used in Queensland, although there is not a consistent approach for defining the datum. For example exit numbers may increase from south to north or north to south.\n\nVictoria and New South Wales have partially implemented sequential exit numbering on selected urban motorways. For instance, the M31 Hume Motorway in New South Wales has exit numbering between Prestons and Campbelltown.\n\n===Europe===\n[[Image:Autobahn Exit 1.svg|thumb|150px|Exit numbers in most countries in Continental Europe]]\nMost European countries use sequential numbering schemes. Spain uses distance-based numbering on its Autovias, but not on its Autopistas. Austria, the Czech Republic, Hungary and Slovakia use distance-based schemes. A number of European countries (including the Netherlands, Belgium and France) do not number motorway intersections, apparently because one cannot \"exit\" the motorway there. Countries like Germany and Switzerland have attributed numbers to their exit, but instead of the usual exit symbol, they are given a specific interchange symbol.\n\nItaly uses sequential numbering on the ring roads for some cities, including the ring road of Rome (''GRA'') and Milan (''Tangenziali''). At one time, it referred to junctions on the [[Autostrada del Sole]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://mryamamoto.50megs.com/Autostrada_del_sole.html|title=Autostrada Del Sole|access-date=2006-09-14|archive-url=https://archive.is/20060505011533/http://mryamamoto.50megs.com/Autostrada_del_sole.html|archive-date=2006-05-05|url-status=dead}}</ref> by number, and published same on toll tickets; though these may not have been posted on signs.\n\nBoth the [[United Kingdom]] and the [[Republic of Ireland]] use sequential numbering systems, with the junction number indicated by a white number in a black square in the corner of signs. In the [[United Kingdom]] they are frequently referenced in the media as the number with \"J\" on front of it, with for example Junction 1 being referred to as \"J1\"; as such this abbreviated term has entered popular usage. If a junction is newly constructed to between two existing junctions, it is normally allocated the number of the lower of the two junctions, with the letter \"A\" attached (and so on). For example, a new junction opened between Junctions 3 and 4 would become Junction 3A.\n\nIn the Republic of Ireland, junction numbers have existed since the opening of the first section of the [[M50 motorway (Ireland)|M50 motorway]] in 1990, however due to the short length of Irish motorways until the early 2000s they were normally ignored by the general public. They are beginning to come into popular usage now, and since 2005 have been given greater prominence on road signs. With the development of the inter-urban motorway network under the [[National Development Plan]] and [[Transport 21]], the [[National Roads Authority]] has adopted a numbering scheme for the inter-urban roads that will see Junction 1 being designated as that road's junction with the M50 in most cases. This has meant renumbering of existing junctions on some motorways, most notably the [[M7 motorway (Ireland)|M7 motorway]]. Non-motorway dual carriageways forming part of major inter-urban roads also have junction numbers, however only grade-separated interchanges are numbered.\n\nThe United Kingdom uses sequential numbering in part because motorway signs use miles rather than kilometres; there are no formal plans to metricate the country's motorway system.\n\n===Canada===\nMost Canadian provinces use kilometre-based exit numbers.\n\n*[[Ontario]] has the oldest exit number system, having started posting exit numbers sequentially in the 1960s along [[Highway 401 (Ontario)|Highway 401]]; it switched to mile-based numbering before Canada went metric. Most short freeways do not have exit numbers, and until about 2000 (with Highways [[Highway 11 (Ontario)|11]] and [[Highway 69 (Ontario)|69]]/[[Highway 400 (Ontario)|400]]), incomplete freeways also did not have exit numbers. Interchanges with multiple exits are lettered ''A-B''.\n*[[Quebec]] has the second oldest system; it also used mile-based junction numbering before the Canadian metric conversion in the mid-1970s. Unlike Ontario, Quebec uses cardinal directions for multiple exits: ''E'' (\"est\"), ''N'' (\"nord\"), ''S'' (\"sud\"), and ''O'' (\"ouest\"); an example of the latter is ''20-O'' (with a hyphen) to avoid confusion with the number. \n*[[British Columbia]] uses distance-based exit numbers on its freeways and expressways.\n*[[Manitoba]] has the fewest posted exit numbers. [[Manitoba Highway 1|Highway 1]] has three numbered exits. Exit numbers were first posted on the [[Perimeter Highway]] in 2001. \n*[[Alberta]] has the newest exit number system. The province started posting exit numbers on [[Alberta Highway 2|Highway 2]] in 2004, and has since extended the system to Highways [[Alberta Highway 1|1]], [[Alberta Highway 16|16]], [[Stoney Trail|201]], and [[Anthony Henday Drive|216]].\n\nSequential numbers are used only in [[Nova Scotia]], and [[Newfoundland and Labrador]].\n\n*[[Nova Scotia]] also numbers level junctions on designated express highways. Multiple exits at an interchange use ''N-S'', or ''E-W''. (Nova Scotia also uses ''Exit 0'' where an interchange is opened \"before\" Exit 1.)\n*[[Saskatchewan]] has recently switched to using the number system. This started with the Regina Bypass project where numbered exits are now used on the freeway. It uses distance-based exit numbers along with exits lettered A-B for interchanges with multiple exits. On a section of [[Saskatchewan Highway 11|Highway 11]] from [[Regina, Saskatchewan|Regina]] to [[Lumsden, Saskatchewan|Lumsden]], letters \"A\", \"B\", and \"C\" are used sequentially as \"exit letters\" instead.\n\nThe territories of [[Yukon Territory|Yukon]], [[Nunavut]], and [[Northwest Territories]] use no exit numbers, as there are no [[freeway]]s or [[Controlled-access highway|expressways]] in the territories. [[Prince Edward Island]] has no exit numbers either, as there is only one interchange in the province.\n\n===Hong Kong===\n{{further|Hong Kong Strategic Route and Exit Number System}}\n\nExit numbers were introduced to major [[Hong Kong]] routes in 2004, in conjunction with the re-organization of the route numbers. A sequential numbering scheme is used.\n\n===Japan===\nThe main expressway system uses sequential numbering; Metropolitan Expressway systems also use sequential junction numbering, usually appended with the expressway number expressed thus: 5-1; 5-2, etc. There are multiple toll expressways not operated by the major national syndicates or the Metropolitan Expressway Authorities that have no junction numbering scheme.\n\n===New Zealand===\nNew Zealand began introducing exit numbers in the Auckland region in 2005. It uses a distance-based numbering system. The distance to the exit is measured from the origin of the highway. That is:\n* State Highway 1 (Northern and Southern Motorways) measured from the origin of SH1 at [[Cape Reinga]]\n* State Highway 16 (Northwestern Motorway) measured from the origin at the Port\n* State Highway 18 (Upper Harbour Motorway) measured from the origin at SH1\n* State Highway 20 (Southwestern Motorway) measured from the origin at SH1\n\nThere is no exit zero. If there is an exit within 1.499&nbsp;km of the origin, Exit 1 is used. Exit 2 would be between 1.500 and 2.499&nbsp;km of the origin. Subsequent 'exit zones' are at 1&nbsp;km intervals. Letter suffixes are added at multi-exit interchanges, or where two or more exits exist within the same exit zone. For example, State Highway 1 (Southern Motorway) has an Exit 429A (Symonds St), Exit 429B (Wellesley St) and Exit 429C (Port). Instead of replacing existing ramp and link signs, the exit numbers were added as supplementary information. Thus drivers can navigate either by exit number or name. Exit numbers are only used for exits that may be used by all vehicle types. Bus- or emergency vehicle-only exits would not be numbered.\n\nExit numbers are not used outside the Auckland region.\n\n===Philippines===\n[[File:Philippines road sign GE4-3A.svg|thumb|right|125px|Exit gore sign in the Philippines. Notice its resemblance to the Australian exit number sign (only used in Queensland).]]\nMetric distance based numbers are used on the tollways radiating from Manila. Supplemental \"A\" and \"B\" designations are appended to signage at the ends of slip roads. Expressway signage, exit number signs, and kilometer markers mostly replicate Australian and American freeway signage.\n\n===South Africa===\nUses distance based numbering (in kilometers) on main motorways. Letter suffixes are added at multi-exit interchanges, an example being the Buccleuch interchange in [[Johannesburg]].\n\nExit numbers are reset on the borders of the provinces as they were until 1994. This means that exit numbering may change in the middle of a province.\n\nOne exception to the usual distance based numbering is the southern portion of the M4 in [[Durban]], which uses sequential numbering.\n\n===Taiwan===\n[[Image:Taiwan Freeway Exit Sign.gif|thumb|150px|Taiwan exit sign prior to 2006]]\n[[Image:Taiwan Freeway New Exit Sign.gif|thumb|150px|current Taiwan exit sign]]\n[[Taiwan]] uses distance-based exit numbers in kilometers.  If two exits are located within the same kilometer mark, the Roman letters are appended to differentiate the exits.  Taiwan did experiment with sequential exit numbers with National Freeway No. 1 for a couple of years, but abandoned the experiment in 2004.\n\nPrior to 2006, Taiwan exit signs were generally near replicas of their US counterparts.  However, the exit signs now not only indicate the distance number, but they also display the Chinese code-name for the interchange.\n\n===United States===\n{{main|Exit numbers in the United States}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Road transport]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Number assigned to a road junction}}\n{{more citations needed|date=October 2013}}\n\n[[Image:I-4 east exits 111A-B.jpg|thumb|right|Exit numbers on [[Interstate 4]] in [[Volusia County, Florida]].

It is usually marked on the same sign as the destinations of the exit. In some countries, such as the United States,<ref name=mutcd/> it is also marked on a sign in the [[gore (road)|gore]].\n\nExit numbers typically reset at political borders such as [[U.S. state|state]] lines.<ref name=mutcd>{{Cite book |author = Federal Highway Administration |author2 = National Committee on Uniform Traffic Control Devices |last-author-amp = yes |date = May 2012 |chapter-url = https://mutcd.fhwa.dot.gov/htm/2009r1r2/part2/part2e.htm#section2E31 |chapter = Section 2E.31: Interchange Exit Numbering |title = Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices  |edition = Revised 2009 |location = Washington, DC |publisher = Federal Highway Administration |access-date = October 29, 2018|author-link = Federal Highway Administration |title-link = Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices }}</ref>\n\nSome non-[[freeway]]s use exit numbers. Typically these are rural roads built to [[Limited-access road|expressway]] standards{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}, and either only the actual exits are numbered, or the at-grade intersections are also numbered. An extreme case of this is in [[New York City]], where the [[Grand Concourse (Bronx)|Grand Concourse]] and [[Linden Boulevard]] were given sequential numbers, one per intersection (both boulevards no longer have exit numbers as of 2011). A milder version of this has been recently used on the [[West Side Highway]], also in New York, where only the major intersections are numbered (possibly to match the planned exits on the cancelled [[Westway (New York)|Westway]] freeway). Another case is the [[Nanaimo Parkway]] in [[Nanaimo, British Columbia]] carrying [[British Columbia Highway 19|Highway 19]], where all exits are numbered though all except one are at-grade intersections. Some other intersections on Highway 19 outside Nanaimo are also given numbers.\n\nAs a means of educating motorists, some [[state highway]] maps include a brief explanation of the exit numbering system on an inset. [[Iowa Department of Transportation|Iowa DOT]] maps from the 1980s and 1990s included a picture or drawing of a [[milestone|milepost]] and briefly described how Iowa had included milepost references near interchanges on the map.\n\n==Sequential numbers==\n[[Image:NJTP exit 8.JPG|thumb|left|The [[New Jersey Turnpike]], with its unusual exit signage, displaying exit 8. This interchange was opened in 1951.]]\n[[Image:NJTP exit 8A.JPG|thumb|left|The New Jersey Turnpike at exit 8A several miles north of exit 8. This interchange was opened in the 1970s, which is why the suffix exists.]]\nSequential exit numbering usually begins with exit 1 at the beginning of the road; each subsequent exit is given the next number. Letter suffixes are commonly used when new exits are added. For example, on the [[New York State Thruway]], an exit was added between 21 and 22, and was given the number 21A. Subsequently, a new exit was added between 21 and 21A, leading to the sequence 21 - 21B - 21A - 22. In [[Florida]], some new exits got the suffix C, so that if it had or acquired separate exits for the two directions, they would be 15CA and 15CB rather than 15AB. There are also occurrences of this happening on the New Jersey Turnpike; the original interchanges opened in 1951, with newer exits as recently as 1982. On the [[Baltimore Beltway]], there is an exit 12B-C ([[Maryland Route 372|MD 372]]), as well as 12A ([[U.S. Route 1 in Maryland|US 1]]). There is also an exit 8A ([[Interstate 895 (Maryland)|I-895]]) and an exit 8 ([[Maryland Route 168|MD 168]]).\n\nSome sequential exits are renumbered (remaining sequential) due to added exits. For instance, the [[Hutchinson River Parkway]] in [[New York (state)|New York]] was renumbered so that its northernmost exit, 27, became 30. However, the [[Merritt Parkway]], which continued the Hutchinson's exit numbers in [[Connecticut]], was not renumbered. This means the [[New York State Route 120A|Route 120A]] interchange is numbered 27 in Connecticut ''and'' 30 in New York.\n\nThe [[Atlantic City-Brigantine Connector]] in [[Atlantic City, New Jersey]] uses letters (without numbers) for its exits; it has many exits in a short distance, and the [[South Jersey Transportation Authority]] may have wanted to avoid numbers, as the Atlantic City Expressway's lowest numbers (mile-based) are in Atlantic City.\n\n==Distance-based numbers==<!-- This section is linked from [[Distance]] -->\n[[Image:Quebec exit number.jpg|thumb|right|An exit sign (kilometer-based) on [[Quebec Autoroute 640]] in Quebec]]\n[[Image:Quebec exit gore sign.jpg|thumb|upright=0.505|An exit gore sign on [[Quebec Autoroute 35]] in Quebec]]\nAs more highways were built, states and countries began to experiment with '''distance-based''' ('''mile-based''' or '''kilometer-based''') exit numbers. The first mile-based system known was implemented on the Garden State Parkway in New Jersey in the late 1950s. Michigan also implemented mile-based junction numbers on [[Interstate 94 in Michigan|Interstate 94]] in the 1960s. In this system, the number of miles from the beginning of the highway to the exit is used for the exit number. If two exits would end up with the same number, the numbers are sometimes modified slightly; this is often impossible and exits are given sequential or directional suffixes, just as with sequential numbers.\n\nAn exit can be numbered by where the exit in the direction of increased mileage leaves the freeway, or by where the road that the exit serves crosses the freeway (which is occasionally ambiguous). From this number, the [[integer]] exit number can be determined by rounding up, rounding down, or rounding to the nearest integer. Many jurisdictions prefer to avoid an exit 0.{{Citation needed|date=December 2014}} To this end, the numbers are either rounded up to get the exit number, or any exit that would get the number 0 is instead numbered 1. Examples of highways with an exit 0 are [[British Columbia Highway 1]] on the mainland, [[Interstate 70 in West Virginia|Interstate 70]] in [[Wheeling, West Virginia]], along the West Virginia\u2013Ohio border, and [[Interstate 90 in Montana|Interstate 90]] on the Montana side of the Idaho\u2013Montana border.<!--three examples are sufficient. this is NOT an exhaustive list; rather it is just an illustrative one.-->\n\nSome freeways' exit number starts from an advanced number (i.e. higher than 1). One reason for starting with a number higher than 1 is that the maintaining agency expects that the highway will be extended. For example, [[Ontario Highway 400]] starts at 20 because it was expected that the southern end of the highway would extend to downtown Toronto (which was never built). Another reason to use a higher number is that the freeway is branching off from another freeway. An example is [[British Columbia Highway 5]], which branches off [[British Columbia Highway 1]] and starts at 170.\n\nIn areas that use the [[metric system]], distance-based numbers are by kilometer rather than mile. A few highways, such as [[Delaware Route 1]] and [[Interstate 19]], have kilometer-based exit numbers, even in areas that typically use miles.\n\n==Exit numbers by country==\n\n===Australia===\nDistance-based exit numbering is used in Queensland, although there is not a consistent approach for defining the datum.
