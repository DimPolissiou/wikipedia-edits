The [[National Portrait Gallery, London]] holds four portraits of her.<ref>{{  cite web | url= http://www.npg.org.uk/collections/search/person/mp15563/gladys-bertha-gb-stern | website=[[National Portrait Gallery, London]] | title=Gladys Bertha ('G.B.') Stern (1890\u20131973), Novelist | accessdate=31 January 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Career==\n\nGB Stern was born on 17 June 1890 in [[North Kensington]], London, the second, by some years, of two sisters.<ref name=\"Orlando\"/> Her family lost their money in the Vaal River diamond crash. After that, they lived in a series of apartments, hotels and boarding houses. Gladys was schooled in England until the age of 16, when, with her parents, she traveled to the continent and studied in Germany and Switzerland.<ref>Penguin edition biography in ''The Matriarch'', published 1987.</ref>\n\nShe wrote her first novel, ''Pantomime'', in 1914 at the age of 24. Her first critical success came with ''Twos and Threes'' in 1916. Her most popular books were the series known by the name of the first, ''The Matriarch''. This was first published as ''Tents of Israel'' in 1924. The others in the series are ''A Deputy Was King'' (1926), ''Mosaic'' (1930), ''Shining and Free'' (1935) and ''The Young Matriarch'' (1942).<ref name=\"Penguin edition biography\">Penguin edition biography</ref>\n\n''The Matriarch'' series revolved around the Rakonitz and Czelovar families and were based on her own family. They are well-to-do and cosmopolitan Jews who settled in England from Hungary, Poland, Russia, and Austria. Like her family, they suffer through an economic crash.<ref>[[Julia Neuberger]]. Introduction to ''The Matriarch'', Penguin 1987 edition.</ref>\n\nThe first book in the series, ''The Matriarch'', centers around two characters, the matriarch Anastasia and her granddaughter, Toni. Anastasia was based on Stern's great-aunt, who was incensed with the portrayal until the book became successful. The book describes in detail the complicated, florid and noisy life of this Jewish-English family through both triumphs and failures, weddings and funerals.<ref name=\"Neuberger\">Neuberger</ref>\n\nThe men in the story are not completely formed, as they play only peripheral roles in family life. They were there mainly to provide income and were always outlived by the Rakonitz women. It is to the matriarch that family members come with their problems and Anatasia rules with an iron, if rather eccentric, hand. Like all the young members of the family, Toni chafes under this rule and vows to be nothing like her \"grandmere\".<ref name=\"Neuberger\"/>\n\nStern's plays include ''[[The Man Who Pays The Piper]]'' (1931), which was revived by the [[Orange Tree Theatre]] in [[Richmond, London]] in 2013.\n\nWith [[Sheila Kaye-Smith]] she wrote the dialogues ''Talking of [[Jane Austen]]'' and ''More Talk of Jane Austen''. She also wrote a biography of [[Robert Louis Stevenson]].\n\nHer final novel, ''Promise Not to Tell'', was published in 1964.<ref name=\"Orlando\">{{cite web | url= http://orlando.cambridge.org/public/svPeople?person_id=stergb | title=G B Stern | publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] | work= Orlando: Women's Writing in the British Isles from the Beginnings to the Present | date=2006\u20132013 | accessdate=4 April 2013 |author1=Susan Brown |author2=Patricia Clements |author3=Isobel Grundy }}</ref>\n\nIn 1966 her 1938 novel ''The Ugly Dachshund'' was made into a film, also titled ''[[The Ugly Dachshund]]''.\n\n==Personal life==\n\nShe married [[New Zealander]] Geoffrey Lisle Holdsworth in 1919 and divorced him \"fairly soon after\". Her closest male friends were the playwright John van Druten and Jack Cohen.<ref name=\"Neuberger\"/> A long-time friend was Rebecca West, who came to call her \"Peter\", as did most of Stern's friends. Stern went through a number of secretaries but Freda Bromhead managed to survive five years with her and came back to help her years later when Stern was in a nursing home.<ref name=\"Neuberger\"/>\n\nHer family was never terribly religious and Stern herself disliked the word 'Jew' and preferred 'Israelite'.<ref name=\"Neuberger\"/>  In 1947 she converted to Catholicism. She wrote about the conversion in 1954 in ''All in Good Time''.<ref name=\"Penguin edition biography\"/>\n\nShe died in [[Wallingford, Oxfordshire]], England on 28 September 1973, at the age of 83.<ref name=\"Orlando\"/>\n\n==Works==\n{{columns-list|colwidth=30em|\n\nThe following is a list of her various works:\n===Plays===\n*''[[The Man Who Pays The Piper.

The [[National Portrait Gallery, London]] holds four portraits of her.<ref>{{  cite web | url= http://www.npg.org.uk/collections/search/person/mp15563/gladys-bertha-gb-stern | website=[[National Portrait Gallery, London]] | title=Gladys Bertha ('G.B.') Stern (1890-1973), Novelist | accessdate=31 January 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Career==\n\nGB Stern was born on 17 June 1890 in [[North Kensington]], London, the second, by some years, of two sisters.<ref name=\"Orlando\"/> Her family lost their money in the Vaal River diamond crash. After that, they lived in a series of apartments, hotels and boarding houses. Gladys was schooled in England until the age of 16, when, with her parents, she traveled to the continent and studied in Germany and Switzerland.<ref>Penguin edition biography in ''The Matriarch'', published 1987.</ref>\n\nShe wrote her first novel, ''Pantomime'', in 1914 at the age of 24. Her first critical success came with ''Twos and Threes'' in 1916. Her most popular books were the series known by the name of the first, ''The Matriarch''. This was first published as ''Tents of Israel'' in 1924. The others in the series are ''A Deputy Was King'' (1926), ''Mosaic'' (1930), ''Shining and Free'' (1935) and ''The Young Matriarch'' (1942).<ref name=\"Penguin edition biography\">Penguin edition biography</ref>\n\n''The Matriarch'' series revolved around the Rakonitz and Czelovar families and were based on her own family. They are well-to-do and cosmopolitan Jews who settled in England from Hungary, Poland, Russia, and Austria. Like her family, they suffer through an economic crash.<ref>[[Julia Neuberger]]. Introduction to ''The Matriarch'', Penguin 1987 edition.</ref>\n\nThe first book in the series, ''The Matriarch'', centers around two characters, the matriarch Anastasia and her granddaughter, Toni. Anastasia was based on Stern's great-aunt, who was incensed with the portrayal until the book became successful. The book describes in detail the complicated, florid and noisy life of this Jewish-English family through both triumphs and failures, weddings and funerals.<ref name=\"Neuberger\">Neuberger</ref>\n\nThe men in the story are not completely formed, as they play only peripheral roles in family life. They were there mainly to provide income and were always outlived by the Rakonitz women. It is to the matriarch that family members come with their problems and Anatasia rules with an iron, if rather eccentric, hand. Like all the young members of the family, Toni chafes under this rule and vows to be nothing like her \"grandmere\".<ref name=\"Neuberger\"/>\n\nStern's plays include ''[[The Man Who Pays The Piper]]'' (1931), which was revived by the [[Orange Tree Theatre]] in [[Richmond, London]] in 2013.\n\nWith [[Sheila Kaye-Smith]] she wrote the dialogues ''Talking of [[Jane Austen]]'' and ''More Talk of Jane Austen''. She also wrote a biography of [[Robert Louis Stevenson]].\n\nHer final novel, ''Promise Not to Tell'', was published in 1964.<ref name=\"Orlando\">{{cite web | url= http://orlando.cambridge.org/public/svPeople?person_id=stergb | title=G B Stern | publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] | work= Orlando: Women's Writing in the British Isles from the Beginnings to the Present | date=2006\u20132013 | accessdate=4 April 2013 |author1=Susan Brown |author2=Patricia Clements |author3=Isobel Grundy }}</ref>\n\nIn 1966 her 1938 novel ''The Ugly Dachshund'' was made into a film, also titled ''[[The Ugly Dachshund]]''.\n\n==Personal life==\n\nShe married [[New Zealander]] Geoffrey Lisle Holdsworth in 1919 and divorced him \"fairly soon after\". Her closest male friends were the playwright John van Druten and Jack Cohen.<ref name=\"Neuberger\"/> A long-time friend was Rebecca West, who came to call her \"Peter\", as did most of Stern's friends. Stern went through a number of secretaries but Freda Bromhead managed to survive five years with her and came back to help her years later when Stern was in a nursing home.<ref name=\"Neuberger\"/>\n\nHer family was never terribly religious and Stern herself disliked the word 'Jew' and preferred 'Israelite'.<ref name=\"Neuberger\"/>  In 1947 she converted to Catholicism. She wrote about the conversion in 1954 in ''All in Good Time''.<ref name=\"Penguin edition biography\"/>\n\nShe died in [[Wallingford, Oxfordshire]], England on 28 September 1973, at the age of 83.<ref name=\"Orlando\"/>\n\n==Works==\n{{columns-list|colwidth=30em|\n\nThe following is a list of her various works:\n===Plays===\n*''[[The Man Who Pays The Piper.
