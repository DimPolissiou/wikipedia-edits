In 1904, in response to [[Newcastle Corporation Tramways|tramway competition]] which was taking away passengers, the [[North Eastern Railway (United Kingdom)|North Eastern Railway]] started [[railway electrification in Great Britain|electrifying]] parts of their local railway network north of the [[River Tyne]] with a 600\u00a0[[Volt|V]] [[direct current|DC]] [[third-rail]] system, forming one of the earliest suburban electric networks, known as the [[Tyneside Electrics|''Tyneside Electrics'']]. In 1938, the line south of the [[River Tyne]] between [[Newcastle upon Tyne|Newcastle]] and {{rws|South Shields}} was also electrified.\n\nUnder [[British Rail]] in the 1960s, the decision was made to de-electrify the ''Tyneside Electrics'' network and convert it to diesel operation, owing to falling passenger numbers and the cost of renewing end-of-life electrical infrastructure and rolling stock. The [[Newcastle upon Tyne|Newcastle]] to [[South Shields]] line was de-electrified in 1963, along with the [[North Tyneside]] routes, in 1967.<ref name=\"TAGBI\">{{cite book|last1=Schwandle|first1=Robert|title=Tram Atlas Britain & Ireland|date=|publisher=Robert Schwandl|year=2015|isbn=9783936573459|location=Berlin, Germany|pp=132\u2013137}}</ref><ref name=\"TNEE\">{{cite book|last1=Hoole|first1=K.|title=North Eastern Electrics: The History of the Tyneside Electric Passenger Services, 1904\u201367|date=|publisher=The Oakwood Press|year=1987|isbn=9780853613589|location=United Kingdom|pages=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.emus.co.uk/zone/tyneside/tyneside.htm|title=The Tyneside Electrics|last=|first=|date=|website=Suburban Electric Railway Association|publisher=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|accessdate=1 January 2018}}</ref> This was widely viewed as a backward step, as the [[diesel multiple unit|diesel trains]] were slower than the electric trains they replaced.<ref name=\"SRT23\">{{cite book|last1=Young|first1=Alan|title=Suburban Railways of Tyneside|date=|publisher=Martin Bairstow|year=1999|isbn=9781871944204|location=|page=23|pages=}}</ref>\n\n===Planning and construction===\nIn the early 1970s, the poor local transport system was identified as one of the main factors holding back the region's economy, and in 1971 a study was commissioned by the recently created [[Tyne and Wear Passenger Transport Authority|Tyneside Passenger Transport Authority]] (now known as ''[[Tyne and Wear Passenger Transport Executive|Nexus]]'') into how the transport system could be improved.\n\nThis study recommended reviving the badly run-down former Tyneside Electrics network by converting it into an electrified [[rapid transit]] system, which would include a new underground section to better serve the busy central areas of [[Newcastle upon Tyne|Newcastle]] and [[Gateshead]], as it was felt that the existing rail network didn't serve these areas adequately. This new system was intended to be the core of a new integrated transport network, with buses acting as feeders to purpose-built transport interchanges. The plans were approved by the Tyneside Metropolitan Railway Bill, which was passed by [[Parliament]] in July 1973. Around 70% of the funding for the scheme came from a central [[Government of the United Kingdom|Government]] grant, with the remainder coming from local sources.<ref name=\"Nexus-history\">{{cite web|url=http://www.nexus.org.uk/history/landmarks-urban-transport|title=Landmarks in urban transport|last=|first=|date=|year=|website=Nexus|publisher=Nexus|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|accessdate=18 March 2020}}</ref><ref name=\":9\">{{Cite book|last=|first=|title=Meet Your Metro|publisher=Tyne and Wear Transport|year=June 1978|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref> \n\nThree railway lines, totalling {{convert|26|mi|km|abbr=}} were to be converted into Metro lines as part of the initial system \u2013 these being the [[North Tyneside Loop]] and [[Newcastle upon Tyne|Newcastle]] to [[South Shields]] branch (both of which were formerly part of the ''Tyneside Electrics'' network), and a short stretch of the freight-only [[Ponteland Railway]] between {{Metro|South Gosforth}} and [[Bank Foot Metro station|Bank Foot]], which had not seen any passenger traffic since 1929.<ref name=\"TAGBI\" />\n\nThe converted railway lines were to be connected by around {{convert|6|mi|km|abbr=}} of new infrastructure, which was built both to separate the Metro from the existing rail network, and also to create the new underground routes under [[Newcastle upon Tyne|Newcastle]] and [[Gateshead]].

This arrangement also exists at [[Voorweg RandstadRail station|Voorweg]] on the [[Randstadrail|RandstadRail]] network in [[The Hague]], and at [[Serdika Metro Station|Serdika]], on the [[Sofia Metro]] in [[Bulgaria]].\n\nA short spur line, running partly under a tunnel, runs from [[Manors Metro station|Manors]] to [[Jesmond Metro station|Jesmond]]. The line is used for empty stock movements only, and has no passenger service. Before the Metro tunnels were created, it was part of the main rail route to [[Newcastle railway station|Newcastle]], and connected to the main line at [[Manors railway station|Manors]].<ref name=\"TTPELGOS\" />\n\nThe tunnels were constructed in the late 1970s, using mining techniques, and were constructed as single-track tubes with a diameter of {{convert|4.75|m|ft|abbr=on}}.<ref name=\"TAGBI\" /> The tunnels under [[Newcastle upon Tyne|Newcastle]] were mechanically bored through [[boulder clay]], and lined with cast iron or concrete segments. The tunnel under [[Gateshead]] was bored through [[sandstone]] and excavated coal seams. Old coal mine workings, some of which dated from the [[Middle Ages]], had to be filled in before the tunnelling began.<ref name=\":9\" /> \n\n===Distances===\nDistances on the system are measured from a datum point at [[South Gosforth Metro station|South Gosforth]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.whatdotheyknow.com/request/tw_metro_station_distances|title=TW Metro Station Distances - a Freedom of Information request to Tyne and Wear Passenger Transport Executive|date=2013-01-18|website=WhatDoTheyKnow|language=en|access-date=2020-03-17}}</ref> The system is metric, with distances in kilometres, and rounded to the nearest metre.

In 1904, in response to [[Newcastle Corporation Tramways|tramway competition]] which was taking away passengers, the [[North Eastern Railway (United Kingdom)|North Eastern Railway]] started [[railway electrification in Great Britain|electrifying]] parts of their local railway network north of the [[River Tyne]] with a 600\u00a0[[Volt|V]] [[direct current|DC]] [[third-rail]] system, forming one of the earliest suburban electric networks, known as the [[Tyneside Electrics|''Tyneside Electrics'']]. In 1938, the line south of the [[River Tyne]] between [[Newcastle upon Tyne|Newcastle]] and {{rws|South Shields}} was also electrified.\n\nUnder [[British Rail]] in the 1960s, the decision was made to de-electrify the ''Tyneside Electrics'' network and convert it to diesel operation, owing to falling passenger numbers and the cost of renewing end-of-life electrical infrastructure and rolling stock. The [[Newcastle upon Tyne|Newcastle]] to [[South Shields]] line was de-electrified in 1963, along with the [[North Tyneside]] routes, in 1967.<ref name=\"TAGBI\">{{cite book|last1=Schwandle|first1=Robert|title=Tram Atlas Britain & Ireland|date=|publisher=Robert Schwandl|year=2015|isbn=9783936573459|location=Berlin, Germany|pp=132\u2013137}}</ref><ref name=\"TNEE\">{{cite book|last1=Hoole|first1=K.|title=North Eastern Electrics: The History of the Tyneside Electric Passenger Services, 1904\u201367|date=|publisher=The Oakwood Press|year=1987|isbn=9780853613589|location=United Kingdom|pages=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.emus.co.uk/zone/tyneside/tyneside.htm|title=The Tyneside Electrics|last=|first=|date=|website=Suburban Electric Railway Association|publisher=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|accessdate=1 January 2018}}</ref> This was widely viewed as a backward step, as the [[diesel multiple unit|diesel trains]] were slower than the electric trains they replaced.<ref name=\"SRT23\">{{cite book|last1=Young|first1=Alan|title=Suburban Railways of Tyneside|date=|publisher=Martin Bairstow|year=1999|isbn=9781871944204|location=|page=23|pages=}}</ref>\n\n===Planning and construction===\nIn the early 1970s, the poor local transport system was identified as one of the main factors holding back the region's economy, and in 1971 a study was commissioned by the recently created [[Tyne and Wear Passenger Transport Authority|Tyneside Passenger Transport Authority]] (now known as ''[[Tyne and Wear Passenger Transport Executive|Nexus]]'') into how the transport system could be improved.\n\nThis study recommended reviving the badly run-down former Tyneside Electrics network by converting it into an electrified [[rapid transit]] system, which would include a new underground section to better serve the busy central areas of [[Newcastle upon Tyne|Newcastle]] and [[Gateshead]], as it was felt that the existing rail network didn't serve these areas adequately. This new system was intended to be the core of a new integrated transport network, with buses acting as feeders to purpose-built transport interchanges. The plans were approved by the Tyneside Metropolitan Railway Bill, which was passed by [[Parliament]] in July 1973. Around 70% of the funding for the scheme came from a central [[Government of the United Kingdom|Government]] grant, with the remainder coming from local sources.<ref name=\"Nexus-history\">{{cite web|url=http://www.nexus.org.uk/history/landmarks-urban-transport|title=Landmarks in urban transport|last=|first=|date=|year=|website=Nexus|publisher=Nexus|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|accessdate=18 March 2020}}</ref><ref name=\":9\">{{Cite book|last=|first=|title=Meet Your Metro|publisher=Tyne and Wear Transport|year=June 1978|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref> \n\nThree railway lines, totalling {{convert|26|mi|km|abbr=}} were to be converted into Metro lines as part of the initial system \u2013 these being the [[North Tyneside Loop]] and [[Newcastle upon Tyne|Newcastle]] to [[South Shields]] branch (both of which were formerly part of the ''Tyneside Electrics'' network), and a short stretch of the freight-only [[Ponteland Railway]] between {{Metro|South Gosforth}} and [[Bank Foot Metro station|Bank Foot]], which had not seen any passenger traffic since 1929.<ref name=\"TAGBI\" />\n\nThe converted railway lines were to be connected by around {{convert|6|mi|km|abbr=}} of new infrastructure, which was built both to separate the Metro from the existing rail network, and also to create the new underground routes under [[Newcastle upon Tyne|Newcastle]] and [[Gateshead]].

The Metro was intended to cover trunk journeys, while buses were re-designed towards shorter, local trips, to bring passengers to and from Metro stations, using [[unified ticketing]], and with their timetable integrated with the Metro schedule. Several purpose-built transport interchanges, such as {{metro|Four Lane Ends}}, [[Heworth Interchange|Heworth]] and {{metro|Regent Centre}} were built for this purpose.

By the age of 14 he was helping his father produce illustrations for books and magazines. His talent was recognised by the editor of the Italian [[magazine|periodical]] ''L'Illustrazione Italiania'' and Matania produced weekly illustrations for the magazine between 1895 and 1902.\n\nAt the age of 20, Matania began working in [[Paris]] for ''Illustration Francaise'' and, in 1902, was invited to London to cover the Coronation of [[Edward VII of the United Kingdom|Edward VII]] for ''[[The Graphic]]''. Matania would subsequently cover every major event \u2013 marriage, christening, funeral and Coronation \u2013 of British royalty up to the coronation of [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Queen Elizabeth]] in 1953.\n\nIn 1904, Matania joined the staff of ''[[The Sphere (newspaper)|The Sphere]]'' where some of his most famous work was to appear, including his illustrations of the sinking of the ''[[RMS Titanic|Titanic]]'' in 1912.\nAround 1906 to 1910 he painted the life in the lobby of the [[The Westin Excelsior, Rome|Hotel Excelsior]] in Rome.<ref>[http://www.famoushotels.org/article/1106 Hotel Excelsior Rome, illustration of a postcard, ca 1910.]</ref>\n\n[[File:The Last General Absolution of the Munsters at Rue du Bois.jpg|thumb|''The Last General Absolution of [[Royal Munster Fusiliers|the Munsters]] at Rue du Bois'' by Matania depicting the regiment on the eve of the [[Battle of Aubers Ridge]] in May 1915]]\nAt the outbreak of the [[World War I|First World War]], Matania became a [[war artist]] and was acclaimed for his graphic and realistic images of trench warfare. His painting for the [[The Blue Cross|Blue Cross]] entitled ''Goodbye, Old Man'', showing a British soldier saying farewell to his dying horse, is a fine example of his emotive work.<ref>[http://www.edinburghs-war.ed.ac.uk/system/files/PDF_horses.pdf Edinburgh's War: Horses in World War One] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140522093229/http://www.edinburghs-war.ed.ac.uk/system/files/PDF_horses.pdf |date=22 May 2014 }}</ref> His painting of the [[Green Howards]] including [[Henry Tandey]] is a central part of a famous story.<ref>[http://rememberwhen.gazettelive.co.uk/2010/08/how-a-green-howard-nearly-shot.html \"How a Green Howard nearly shot Hitler ...but not quite!\"], Paul Delplanque</ref>\n\nBut it was after the war, when he switched to scenes of ancient high life for the British woman's magazine, Britannia and Eve, that Matania found his real career. He filled his London studio with reproductions of Roman furniture, pored over history books for suitably lively subjects. Then, with the help of models and statues, he began to paint such subjects as Samson & Delilah, the bacchanalian roisters of ancient Rome, and even early American Indian maidens\u2014all with the same careful respect for accuracy and detail he had used in his news assignments.\n\nGenerally he managed to include one or two voluptuous nudes in each picture. \"The public demanded it,\" says Matania. \"If there was no nude, then the editor or I would get a shower of letters from readers asking politely why not.\" He was a standard in Britannia and Eve for 19 years.\n\nMatania exhibited regularly at the [[Royal Academy]] and [[Royal Institute of Painters in Water Colours]], in 1917 he was elected a member of the latter. From 1908 and his work appearing in most of the principal magazines in Britain and America, including ''[[Illustrated London News]]'', ''London Magazine'',  ''Nash's'', ''Printer's Pie'' and others. When ''Britannia and Eve'' was launched in 1929, Matania became one of its first contributors. For 19 years, he wrote and illustrated historical stories for the magazine. His talents made him a popular illustrator for advertising, posters and catalogues, working for the [[London, Midland and Scottish Railway|LMS]] (designing posters for Southport and Blackpool<ref>https://artuk.org/discover/artworks/blackpool-9650</ref>), Ovaltine, Burberry's (the sporting outfitters) and many others. Matania was also recommented to [[Hollywood]] director [[Cecil B. DeMille]] and produced a number of paintings of [[Rome]] and [[Egypt]] from which authentic designs could be made for the movie [[The Ten Commandments (1923 film)|The Ten Commandments]]. In 1933, Matania applied his very realistic style to illustrations for [[Edgar Rice Burroughs]]' \"[[Pirates of Venus]]\" and in 1933\u201324 to Burrough's \"[[Lost on Venus]].\"<ref>[https://www.korshakcollection.com/fortunino-matania \"Fortunino Matania\"], The Korshak Collection</ref>\n\nIn later years, he provided his topic-oriented illustrations to big Italian magazines\u2014from \"Il Mattino Illustrato\" (1924\u20131947) and \"Scena Illustrata\" to \"Illustrazione del Popolo\" (1941\u20131947), \"Corriere dei Piccoli\" (1948\u20131954), and \"[[Domenica del Corriere]]\"  (1948\u20131951).<ref>[http://anglo-italianfhs.org.uk/transcriptions/matania_fortunino.php \"Fortunino Matania\"], Anglo-Italian Family History Society</ref>\n\nTowards the end of his life, Matania illustrated features for the educational weekly ''[[Look and Learn]]'' and was working on the series ''A Pageant of Kings'' at the time of his death.\n\n==Books illustrated by Fortunino Matania==\n*''Six Stories from Shakespeare'', retold by [[John Buchan, 1st Baron Tweedsmuir|John Buchan]] (1934)\n*''Raphael and Stella: A Baker's Delight Immortalised in Paint'', by Matania (1944)\n*''Great Stories from History'', ed.
