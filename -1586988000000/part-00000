The older lamps that resembled an incandescent lamp were often operated in series with an ordinary 40&nbsp;W incandescent \"appliance\" lamp; the incandescent lamp acted as the ballast for the germicidal lamp.\n\n==Uses==\n{{further|Ultraviolet germicidal irradiation}}\nGermicidal lamps are used to sterilize workspaces and tools used in biology laboratories and medical facilities. If the quartz envelope transmits wavelengths shorter than 253.7&nbsp;nm, they can also be used wherever [[ozone]] is desired, for example, in the sanitizing systems of [[hot tub]]s and [[aquarium]]s. They are also used by [[geologist]]s to provoke fluorescence in [[mineral]] samples, aiding in their identification. In this application, the light produced by the lamp is usually [[filter (optics)|filtered]] to remove as much visible light as possible, leaving just the UV light. Germicidal lamps are also used in waste water treatment in order to kill microorganisms.\n\n[[Image:Eprom.jpg|thumb|right|An [[EPROM]]. The small quartz window allows UV light to enter during erasure.]]\nThe light produced by germicidal lamps is also used to erase [[EPROM]]s; the ultraviolet photons are sufficiently energetic to allow the electrons trapped on the [[field effect transistor|transistors']] [[floating-gate transistor|floating gates]] to tunnel through the gate insulation, eventually removing the stored charge that represents binary ones and zeroes.\n\n==Ozone production==\nFor most purposes, ozone production would be a detrimental side effect of lamp operation. To prevent this, most germicidal lamps are treated to absorb the 185&nbsp;nm mercury emission line (which is the longest wavelength of mercury light which will ionize oxygen).\n\nIn some cases (such as water sanitization), [[Ozone#Ultraviolet light|ozone production]] is precisely the point. This requires specialized lamps which do not have the surface treatment.\n\n==Safety concerns==\nShort-wave UV light is harmful to humans. In addition to causing [[sunburn]] and (over time) [[skin cancer]], this light can produce extremely painful inflammation of the [[cornea]] of the eye, which may lead to temporary or permanent [[vision impairment]].<ref name=\"Liverpool, UVGI\" /> <ref name=\":0\" /> For this reason, the light produced by a germicidal lamp must be carefully shielded against direct viewing, with consideration of reflections and dispersed light.

Advances in understanding and synthesis of the AlGaN materials system led to significant increases in the output power, device lifetime, and efficiency of UVC LEDs in the early 2010s.\n\nThe reduced size of LEDs opens up options for small reactor systems allowing for point-of-use applications and integration into medical devices.<ref name=\"Hessling et al 2016\">{{Cite journal |last=Hessling|first=Martin|last2=Gross|first2=Andrej|last3=Hoenes|first3=Katharina|last4=Rath|first4=Monika|last5=Stangl|first5=Felix|last6=Tritschler|first6=Hanna|last7=Sift|first7=Michael|date=2016-01-27|title=Efficient Disinfection of Tap and Surface Water with Single High Power 285&nbsp;nm LED and Square Quartz Tube|journal=Photonics|language=en|volume=3|issue=1|pages=7|doi=10.3390/photonics3010007}}</ref> Low power consumption of semiconductors introduce UV disinfection systems that utilized small solar cells in remote or Third World applications.<ref name=\"Hessling et al 2016\" />\n\nBy 2019 LEDs made up 41.4% of UV Light Sales, up from 19.2% in 2014<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.seoulviosys.com/en/technology/uvled/|title=Seoul Viosys {{!}} Technology {{!}} UV LED|website=www.seoulviosys.com|access-date=2020-04-09}}</ref>  The UV-C LED global market is expected to rise from $223m in 2017 to US$991m in 2023.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.semiconductor-today.com/news_items/2019/apr/led-inside-290419.shtml|title=Anti-bacterial UV-C LED applications driving stable growth in UV-LED market|website=www.semiconductor-today.com|access-date=2020-04-09}}</ref>\n\n==Auxiliary equipment==\nAs with all gas discharge lamps, all of the styles of germicidal lamps exhibit [[negative resistance]] and require the use of an external [[ballast (electrical)|ballast]] to regulate the current flow through them. The older lamps that resembled an incandescent lamp were often operated in series with an ordinary 40&nbsp;W incandescent \"appliance\" lamp; the incandescent lamp acted as the ballast for the germicidal lamp.\n\n==Uses==\n{{further|Ultraviolet germicidal irradiation}}\nGermicidal lamps are used to sterilize workspaces and tools used in biology laboratories and medical facilities. If the quartz envelope transmits wavelengths shorter than 253.7&nbsp;nm, they can also be used wherever [[ozone]] is desired, for example, in the sanitizing systems of [[hot tub]]s and [[aquarium]]s. They are also used by [[geologist]]s to provoke fluorescence in [[mineral]] samples, aiding in their identification. In this application, the light produced by the lamp is usually [[filter (optics)|filtered]] to remove as much visible light as possible, leaving just the UV light. Germicidal lamps are also used in waste water treatment in order to kill microorganisms.\n\n[[Image:Eprom.jpg|thumb|right|An [[EPROM]]. The small quartz window allows UV light to enter during erasure.]]\nThe light produced by germicidal lamps is also used to erase [[EPROM]]s; the ultraviolet photons are sufficiently energetic to allow the electrons trapped on the [[field effect transistor|transistors']] [[floating-gate transistor|floating gates]] to tunnel through the gate insulation, eventually removing the stored charge that represents binary ones and zeroes.\n\n==Ozone production==\nFor most purposes, ozone production would be a detrimental side effect of lamp operation. To prevent this, most germicidal lamps are treated to absorb the 185&nbsp;nm mercury emission line (which is the longest wavelength of mercury light which will ionize oxygen).\n\nIn some cases (such as water sanitization), [[Ozone#Ultraviolet light|ozone production]] is precisely the point. This requires specialized lamps which do not have the surface treatment.\n\n==Safety concerns==\nShort-wave UV light is harmful to humans. In addition to causing [[sunburn]] and (over time) [[skin cancer]], this light can produce extremely painful inflammation of the [[cornea]] of the eye, which may lead to temporary or permanent [[vision impairment]].<ref name=\"Liverpool, UVGI\" /> <ref name=\":0\" /> For this reason, the light produced by a germicidal lamp must be carefully shielded against direct viewing, with consideration of reflections and dispersed light.

{"title_page": "Textual variants in the First Epistle of John", "text_new": "{{short description|Textual variants in the First Epistle of John}}\n'''Textual variants in the [[First Epistle of John]]''' are the subject of the study called [[textual criticism]] of the [[New Testament]]. Textual variants in [[manuscript]]s arise when a copyist makes deliberate or inadvertent alterations to a text that is being reproduced. \nAn abbreviated list of textual variants in this particular book is given in this article below.\n\nMost of the variations are not significant and some common alterations include the deletion, rearrangement, repetition, or replacement of one or more words when the copyist's eye returns to a similar word in the wrong location of the original text. If their eye skips to an earlier word, they may create a repetition (error of [[dittography]]). If their eye skips to a later word, they may create an omission. They may resort to performing a rearranging of words to retain the overall meaning without compromising the context. In other instances, the copyist may add text from memory from a similar or parallel text in another location. Otherwise, they may also replace some text of the original with an alternative reading. Spellings occasionally change. Synonyms may be substituted. A pronoun may be changed into a proper noun (such as \"he said\" becoming \"Jesus said\").

{"title_page": "Rosh Hashana kibbutz", "text_new": "[[File:Nahmantomb.JPG|thumb|280px|right|Pilgrimage to the [[Ohel (grave)|ohel]] of Rabbi [[Nachman of Breslov]]]]\n\nThe '''Rosh Hashana Kibbutz''' ({{lang-he|\u05e7\u05d9\u05d1\u05d5\u05e5}}; plural: '''kibbutzim''': \u05e7\u05d9\u05d1\u05d5\u05e6\u05d9\u05dd, \"gathering\" or \"ingathering\") is a large prayer assemblage of [[Breslov (Hasidic dynasty)|Breslover]] [[Hasidic Judaism|Hasidim]] held on the [[Jew]]ish [[New Year]]. It specifically refers to the [[pilgrimage]] of tens of thousands of [[Hasidic Judaism|Hasidim]] to the city of [[Uman, Ukraine]],{{cn|date=February 2020}} but also refers to sizable [[Rosh Hashana]] gatherings of Breslover Hasidim in other locales around the world. In recent years the pilgrimage to Uman has attracted Jewish seekers from all levels of religious observance and affiliation, including introducing [[Sephardic Jews]] to [[Deveikut|Hasidic spirituality]]. This has added to Breslov's position in the [[Baal teshuva movement]] of Jewish outreach.\n\n==Rosh Hashana with Rebbe Nachman==\nThe first Rosh Hashana kibbutz was initiated by Rebbe [[Nachman of Breslov]] during his lifetime. He strongly encouraged his followers to spend each Rosh Hashana with him in the town of [[Bratslav|Breslov]]. Hundreds of followers would gather for the holiday prayer service, festive meals, and special [[Torah]] lessons taught by the Rebbe. When asked why Rosh Hashana was so significant, Rebbe Nachman explained, \"My Rosh Hashana is greater than everything. I cannot understand how it is that if my followers really believe in me, they are not all scrupulous about being with me for Rosh Hashana. No one should be missing! Rosh Hashana is my whole mission.\"<ref>''Tzaddik'' #403.</ref>\n\nTo one follower who said he preferred to visit the Rebbe on the [[Shabbat]] after Rosh Hashana, when he would have more space to pray, eat and sleep, the Rebbe replied, \"Whether you eat or don't eat; whether you sleep or don't sleep; whether you pray or don't pray (i.e. with the proper concentration); just make sure to be with me for Rosh Hashana, no matter what!\"<ref>''Tzaddik'' #404.</ref>\n\nElsewhere, Rebbe Nachman explained that traveling to a [[tzaddik]] on Rosh Hashana is a time-honored practice which helps to mitigate and \"sweeten\" Heavenly decrees at their source, at the beginning of the new year.<ref>Kramer, ''Crossing the Narrow Bridge'', p. 363.</ref> The Rebbe also mentioned before the last Rosh Hashana of his life (in 1810) that there were people who were unable to achieve their ''tikkun'' (self-rectification) all year, nor was he able to help them then. On Rosh Hashana, however, these ''tikkunim'' could be effected.<ref>''Tzaddik'' #406.</ref>\n\nIn 1843, on the last Rosh Hashana of his own life, [[Nathan of Breslov]] (\"Reb Noson\"), the Rebbe's closest disciple and leader of the movement after the Rebbe's death, expounded on the meaning of Rebbe Nachman's Rosh Hashana in this way:\n\n<blockquote>We see that on Rosh Hashana, Jews flock to the synagogue, to their leaders. They come from all the towns and villages to be together on Rosh Hashana. This is because the Jewish People are likened to a flock of sheep who gather around their shepherd. When the shepherd wishes to call his flock, he blows his horn. This is the reason for the blowing of the shofar on Rosh Hashana. The shepherd, the true tzaddik, is calling his \"flock\" together, seeking ways to help each one of them fulfill his destiny.\"<ref>''Likutey Halachos, Netilas Yadayim'' 6:89, quoted in Kramer, ''Through Fire and Water'', p. 512.</ref></blockquote>\n\nRebbe Nachman died in October 1810 and was buried in the Uman cemetery. Afterwards, Reb Noson explained to the other [[Hasidic Judaism|Hasidim]] that Rebbe Nachman had stressed the importance of the Rosh Hashana kibbutz that year because he wanted them to continue to \"be with him\" for the holiday even after his death. He encouraged them to continue to gather at the Rebbe's gravesite in Uman every Rosh Hashana.\n\n==Pilgrimage established by Reb Noson==\nReb Noson arranged the first Rosh Hashana kibbutz the following year (1811) and continued to run it until his death in 1844. In the following decades, hundreds of Hasidim arrived annually from [[Ukraine]], [[Belarus]], [[Lithuania]] and [[Poland]]. So many joined the pilgrimage, in fact, that the local [[synagogue]] was unable to accommodate them. Fearing that people would stop attending the kibbutz, Reb Noson acquired a property, applied for a government permit, raised funds and oversaw the construction of a large Breslover synagogue in Uman in 1834. Known as the ''kloyz'', it housed the annual Rosh Hashana kibbutz through the 1930s.\n\nReb Noson once said, \"Even if the road to Uman were paved with knives, I would crawl there &mdash; just so I could be with my Rebbe on Rosh Hashanah!\"<ref>''Tovot Zichronot'', p. 137.</ref>\n\nIn each generation, the most pious representatives of the movement were honored with leading the prayer services at the annual Rosh Hashana kibbutz. They included: [[Nachman Chazan]], [[Abraham Sternhartz]], [[Levi Yitzchok Bender]], [[Michel Dorfman]], and [[Itzel Korsinski]].\n\nThe annual Rosh Hashana pilgrimage effectively redirected the focus of Breslover Hasidut from the town of Breslov to the town of Uman. Today, the town of Breslov is considered a side-trip for visitors to Ukraine, as the only sites of interest to Breslover Hasidim there are the graves of Reb Noson and other Breslover figures.\n\n==Under Socialism==\nThe Rosh Hashana pilgrimage ground to a halt with the [[Bolshevik Revolution]] of 1917, which sealed the border between [[Russia]] and [[Poland]]. Uman became a \"closed city\" and foreigners were strictly prohibited from entering. Rabbi [[Yitzchok Breiter]], a Breslover Hasid in Poland who drew thousands of his countrymen closer to the Hasidut in the 1920s and 1930s, established a Rosh Hashana kibbutz in [[Lublin]] for their benefit. Hasidim who [[aliyah|emigrated to Israel]] established Rosh Hashana kibbutzim in [[Jerusalem]] and in [[Meron, Israel|Meron]] (the latter at the gravesite of Rabbi [[Shimon bar Yochai]]), which continue to this day. Later, other Rosh Hashana kibbutzim were established in [[New York City]] and in [[Manchester]], [[England]].\n\n[[Shmuel Horowitz]], a native of [[Safed]], [[Mandate Palestine]], was the last foreign citizen to sneak across the Polish border into Russia around 1929. He participated in three Rosh Hashana kibbutzim in Uman before he was discovered and arrested for [[illegal entry]]. After spending three months in a Soviet prison, Horowitz was released with the intervention of the [[Chief Rabbi]] of Mandate Palestine, [[Abraham Isaac Kook]], and returned in 1933.\n\nDespite the Communist ban on public prayer gatherings, Breslover Hasidim in Russia continued to gather clandestinely every Rosh Hashana during the 1920s and 1930s. In 1934, the Soviets ostensibly granted permission for 28 Hasidim to travel to Uman for Rosh Hashana. In fact, it was a ruse to discover their identities &mdash; 16 were murdered while still in Uman and 12 were exiled to Siberia. Only four of the exiles survived. In 1936, the authorities shut down the ''kloyz'' built by Reb Noson and turned it into a metalworking factory.\n\nThe Rosh Hashana kibbutz was relocated to a rented apartment in 1936 and 1937. The last kibbutz before [[World War II]] was held in 1938. Twenty-seven Hasidim risked their lives to participate in this gathering.\n\n[[World War II]] and the [[Holocaust]] decimated the numbers of Breslover Hasidim living in Russia. The Rosh Hashana pilgrimage resumed on a drastically smaller scale in 1948, when 11 Hasidim independently traveled from cities throughout Russia to Uman for Rosh Hashana. From then until the 1970s, when most of the remaining Hasidim were permitted to emigrate to [[Israel]], only between 9 and 13 Hasidim braved the annual trip. They were often forced to change the location of their prayer services from year to year to escape discovery by the authorities.\n\nBeginning in the 1950s, [[Michel Dorfman]] in Moscow became the official organizer of the Rosh Hashana kibbutz. Hasidim from throughout Russia would contact him for details about each year's event, and he wrote letters to others, encouraging them to continue this practice of being with Rebbe Nachman for Rosh Hashana despite the long journey and the threat of government surveillance.\n\n==International focus==\nIn the 1960s, when the majority of Hasidim in the Breslover movement resided outside the Soviet Union, Rebbe Nachman's gravesite began to turn from being an internal Russian destination to an international one. A young New York Hasid named [[Gedaliah Fleer]] was the first foreign citizen to enter Uman without permission in 1963, with Dorfman's help. The Soviets would only issue tourist [[Visa (document)|visa]]s to larger cities like [[Kiev]] and [[Odessa]], not to Uman. Fleer returned to Uman in 1965 to join the Rosh Hashana kibbutz with 12 other Russian Hasidim. Fleer pretended to be from the Soviet Republic of Georgia and that he did not speak Yiddish or Russian  in order to protect his identity. Had the participants known that a foreign citizen was in their midst, they would have quit the kibbutz immediately.<ref>Fleer, ''Against All Odds'', p. 156.</ref>\n\nFrom the 1960s until the fall of Communist Government in 1989, several hundred [[United States|American]] and [[Israelis|Israeli]] Hasidim made their way to Uman, both legally and illegally, to pray at the grave of Rebbe Nachman. Sometimes the government issued individual tourist visas to Uman, but no one was allowed to stay in the city overnight. In 1975, however, Rabbi [[Herschel Wasilski]], the official American representative of Breslover Hasidut, received permission to conduct a [[minyan]] at the Rebbe's gravesite on the eve of Rosh Hashana with 11 other men and spent the holiday in the city. In 1988, [[glasnost]] and continuing international pressure finally forced the Soviet government to permit 250 foreign citizens to stay in Uman over Rosh Hashana.\n\nThe next year, the fall of Communist government opened the gates entirely. Between 700 and 900 Hasidim gathered in Uman for Rosh Hashana 1989. In 1990, 2,000 Hasidim attended. Large factory sites were called into service to house the crowd. The numbers have continued to grow apace. The Rosh Hashana kibbutz in Uman surpassed the 10,000-person mark in 2000. In 2005, approximately 20,000 men and boys from all countries and all backgrounds converged on the town for the annual event. In 2008, the numbers reached 25,000.<ref>[http://jta.org/news/article/2008/10/02/110639/umanroshhashana \"Hasidic Jews celebrate holiday in Uman\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100514065924/http://jta.org/news/article/2008/10/02/110639/umanroshhashana |date=2010-05-14 }} [[Jewish Telegraphic Agency]], 2008-10-02.

Besides the communal prayer services, Torah classes are conducted in [[Yiddish language|Yiddish]], [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]], [[English language|English]], [[Russian language|Russian]], and [[French language|French]]. A visual highlight of the Rosh Hashana kibbutz is the [[Tashlikh]] ceremony, held on the afternoon of the first day of the holiday (if the first day of Rosh Hashana falls on [[Shabbat]], Tashlikh is postponed to the second day of Rosh Hashana). Thousands of Hasidim, dressed entirely in white, sing and dance through the streets of Uman as they make their way down to the river to perform this holiday ritual.\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==See also==\n*[[Kibbutz]]\n\n==References==\n*Fleer, Gedaliah (2005).

It specifically refers to the [[pilgrimage]] of tens of thousands of [[Hasidic Judaism|Hasidim]] to the city of [[Uman, Ukraine]],{{cn|date=February 2020}} but also refers to sizable [[Rosh Hashana]] gatherings of Breslover Hasidim in other locales around the world. In recent years the pilgrimage to Uman has attracted Jewish seekers from all levels of religious observance and affiliation, including introducing [[Sephardic Jews]] to [[Deveikut|Hasidic spirituality]]. This has added to Breslov's position in the [[Baal teshuva movement]] of Jewish outreach.\n\n==Rosh Hashana with Rebbe Nachman==\nThe first Rosh Hashana kibbutz was initiated by Rebbe [[Nachman of Breslov]] during his lifetime. He strongly encouraged his followers to spend each Rosh Hashana with him in the town of [[Bratslav|Breslov]]. Hundreds of followers would gather for the holiday prayer service, festive meals, and special [[Torah]] lessons taught by the Rebbe. When asked why Rosh Hashana was so significant, Rebbe Nachman explained, \"My Rosh Hashana is greater than everything. I cannot understand how it is that if my followers really believe in me, they are not all scrupulous about being with me for Rosh Hashana. No one should be missing! Rosh Hashana is my whole mission.\"<ref>''Tzaddik'' #403.</ref>\n\nTo one follower who said he preferred to visit the Rebbe on the [[Shabbat]] after Rosh Hashana, when he would have more space to pray, eat and sleep, the Rebbe replied, \"Whether you eat or don't eat; whether you sleep or don't sleep; whether you pray or don't pray (i.e. with the proper concentration); just make sure to be with me for Rosh Hashana, no matter what!\"<ref>''Tzaddik'' #404.</ref>\n\nElsewhere, Rebbe Nachman explained that traveling to a [[tzaddik]] on Rosh Hashana is a time-honored practice which helps to mitigate and \"sweeten\" Heavenly decrees at their source, at the beginning of the new year.<ref>Kramer, ''Crossing the Narrow Bridge'', p. 363.</ref> The Rebbe also mentioned before the last Rosh Hashana of his life (in 1810) that there were people who were unable to achieve their ''tikkun'' (self-rectification) all year, nor was he able to help them then. On Rosh Hashana, however, these ''tikkunim'' could be effected.<ref>''Tzaddik'' #406.</ref>\n\nIn 1843, on the last Rosh Hashana of his own life, [[Nathan of Breslov]] (\"Reb Noson\"), the Rebbe's closest disciple and leader of the movement after the Rebbe's death, expounded on the meaning of Rebbe Nachman's Rosh Hashana in this way:\n\n<blockquote>We see that on Rosh Hashana, Jews flock to the synagogue, to their leaders. They come from all the towns and villages to be together on Rosh Hashana. This is because the Jewish People are likened to a flock of sheep who gather around their shepherd. When the shepherd wishes to call his flock, he blows his horn. This is the reason for the blowing of the shofar on Rosh Hashana. The shepherd, the true tzaddik, is calling his \"flock\" together, seeking ways to help each one of them fulfill his destiny.\"<ref>''Likutey Halachos, Netilas Yadayim'' 6:89, quoted in Kramer, ''Through Fire and Water'', p. 512.</ref></blockquote>\n\nRebbe Nachman died in October 1810 and was buried in the Uman cemetery. Afterwards, Reb Noson explained to the other [[Hasidic Judaism|Hasidim]] that Rebbe Nachman had stressed the importance of the Rosh Hashana kibbutz that year because he wanted them to continue to \"be with him\" for the holiday even after his death. He encouraged them to continue to gather at the Rebbe's gravesite in Uman every Rosh Hashana.\n\n==Pilgrimage established by Reb Noson==\nReb Noson arranged the first Rosh Hashana kibbutz the following year (1811) and continued to run it until his death in 1844. In the following decades, hundreds of Hasidim arrived annually from [[Ukraine]], [[Belarus]], [[Lithuania]] and [[Poland]]. So many joined the pilgrimage, in fact, that the local [[synagogue]] was unable to accommodate them. Fearing that people would stop attending the kibbutz, Reb Noson acquired a property, applied for a government permit, raised funds and oversaw the construction of a large Breslover synagogue in Uman in 1834. Known as the ''kloyz'', it housed the annual Rosh Hashana kibbutz through the 1930s.\n\nReb Noson once said, \"Even if the road to Uman were paved with knives, I would crawl there &mdash; just so I could be with my Rebbe on Rosh Hashanah!\"<ref>''Tovot Zichronot'', p. 137.</ref>\n\nIn each generation, the most pious representatives of the movement were honored with leading the prayer services at the annual Rosh Hashana kibbutz. They included: [[Nachman Chazan]], [[Abraham Sternhartz]], [[Levi Yitzchok Bender]], [[Michel Dorfman]], and [[Itzel Korsinski]].\n\nThe annual Rosh Hashana pilgrimage effectively redirected the focus of Breslover Hasidut from the town of Breslov to the town of Uman. Today, the town of Breslov is considered a side-trip for visitors to Ukraine, as the only sites of interest to Breslover Hasidim there are the graves of Reb Noson and other Breslover figures.\n\n==Under Socialism==\nThe Rosh Hashana pilgrimage ground to a halt with the [[Bolshevik Revolution]] of 1917, which sealed the border between [[Russia]] and [[Poland]]. Uman became a \"closed city\" and foreigners were strictly prohibited from entering. Rabbi [[Yitzchok Breiter]], a Breslover Hasid in Poland who drew thousands of his countrymen closer to the Hasidut in the 1920s and 1930s, established a Rosh Hashana kibbutz in [[Lublin]] for their benefit. Hasidim who [[aliyah|emigrated to Israel]] established Rosh Hashana kibbutzim in [[Jerusalem]] and in [[Meron, Israel|Meron]] (the latter at the gravesite of Rabbi [[Shimon bar Yochai]]), which continue to this day. Later, other Rosh Hashana kibbutzim were established in [[New York City]] and in [[Manchester]], [[England]].\n\n[[Shmuel Horowitz]], a native of [[Safed]], [[Mandate Palestine]], was the last foreign citizen to sneak across the Polish border into Russia around 1929. He participated in three Rosh Hashana kibbutzim in Uman before he was discovered and arrested for [[illegal entry]]. After spending three months in a Soviet prison, Horowitz was released with the intervention of the [[Chief Rabbi]] of Mandate Palestine, [[Abraham Isaac Kook]], and returned in 1933.\n\nDespite the Communist ban on public prayer gatherings, Breslover Hasidim in Russia continued to gather clandestinely every Rosh Hashana during the 1920s and 1930s. In 1934, the Soviets ostensibly granted permission for 28 Hasidim to travel to Uman for Rosh Hashana. In fact, it was a ruse to discover their identities &mdash; 16 were murdered while still in Uman and 12 were exiled to Siberia. Only four of the exiles survived. In 1936, the authorities shut down the ''kloyz'' built by Reb Noson and turned it into a metalworking factory.\n\nThe Rosh Hashana kibbutz was relocated to a rented apartment in 1936 and 1937. The last kibbutz before [[World War II]] was held in 1938. Twenty-seven Hasidim risked their lives to participate in this gathering.\n\n[[World War II]] and the [[Holocaust]] decimated the numbers of Breslover Hasidim living in Russia. The Rosh Hashana pilgrimage resumed on a drastically smaller scale in 1948, when 11 Hasidim independently traveled from cities throughout Russia to Uman for Rosh Hashana. From then until the 1970s, when most of the remaining Hasidim were permitted to emigrate to [[Israel]], only between 9 and 13 Hasidim braved the annual trip. They were often forced to change the location of their prayer services from year to year to escape discovery by the authorities.\n\nBeginning in the 1950s, [[Michel Dorfman]] in Moscow became the official organizer of the Rosh Hashana kibbutz. Hasidim from throughout Russia would contact him for details about each year's event, and he wrote letters to others, encouraging them to continue this practice of being with Rebbe Nachman for Rosh Hashana despite the long journey and the threat of government surveillance.\n\n==International focus==\nIn the 1960s, when the majority of Hasidim in the Breslover movement resided outside the Soviet Union, Rebbe Nachman's gravesite began to turn from being an internal Russian destination to an international one. A young New York Hasid named [[Gedaliah Fleer]] was the first foreign citizen to enter Uman without permission in 1963, with Dorfman's help. The Soviets would only issue tourist [[Visa (document)|visa]]s to larger cities like [[Kiev]] and [[Odessa]], not to Uman. Fleer returned to Uman in 1965 to join the Rosh Hashana kibbutz with 12 other Russian Hasidim. Fleer pretended to be from the Soviet Republic of Georgia and that he did not speak Yiddish or Russian  in order to protect his identity. Had the participants known that a foreign citizen was in their midst, they would have quit the kibbutz immediately.<ref>Fleer, ''Against All Odds'', p. 156.</ref>\n\nFrom the 1960s until the fall of Communist Government in 1989, several hundred [[United States|American]] and [[Israelis|Israeli]] Hasidim made their way to Uman, both legally and illegally, to pray at the grave of Rebbe Nachman. Sometimes the government issued individual tourist visas to Uman, but no one was allowed to stay in the city overnight. In 1975, however, Rabbi [[Herschel Wasilski]], the official American representative of Breslover Hasidut, received permission to conduct a [[minyan]] at the Rebbe's gravesite on the eve of Rosh Hashana with 11 other men and spent the holiday in the city. In 1988, [[glasnost]] and continuing international pressure finally forced the Soviet government to permit 250 foreign citizens to stay in Uman over Rosh Hashana.\n\nThe next year, the fall of Communist government opened the gates entirely. Between 700 and 900 Hasidim gathered in Uman for Rosh Hashana 1989. In 1990, 2,000 Hasidim attended. Large factory sites were called into service to house the crowd. The numbers have continued to grow apace. The Rosh Hashana kibbutz in Uman surpassed the 10,000-person mark in 2000. In 2005, approximately 20,000 men and boys from all countries and all backgrounds converged on the town for the annual event. In 2008, the numbers reached 25,000.<ref>[http://jta.org/news/article/2008/10/02/110639/umanroshhashana \"Hasidic Jews celebrate holiday in Uman\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100514065924/http://jta.org/news/article/2008/10/02/110639/umanroshhashana |date=2010-05-14 }} [[Jewish Telegraphic Agency]], 2008-10-02.

Besides the communal prayer services, Torah classes are conducted in [[Yiddish language|Yiddish]], [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]], [[English language|English]], [[Russian language|Russian]], and [[French language|French]]. A visual highlight of the Rosh Hashana kibbutz is the [[Tashlikh]] ceremony, held on the afternoon of the first day of the holiday (if the first day of Rosh Hashana falls on [[Shabbat]], Tashlikh is postponed to the second day of Rosh Hashana). Thousands of Hasidim, dressed entirely in white, sing and dance through the streets of Uman as they make their way down to the river to perform this holiday ritual.\n\n\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==See also==\n*[[Kibbutz]]\n\n==References==\n*Fleer, Gedaliah (2005).

Along this expossure, the Wazzant member appaears at the right lateral, along massive calcareous dolomites, over the Latest [[Pliensbachian]] strata, where the lower Toarcian strata is missing.<ref name=Taquet1 /> The Wazzant facies never exceed 50 m, getting it\u00b4s maximum exposure at the north of the [[Guettioua Formation]].<ref name=Taquet1 /> The facies of the formation follow a deposition typical of Alluvial Plains.<ref name=Jenny1 /><ref name=Ibouh1 /> It also recovers a succession of reddish brown tones predominantly terrigenous: [[Conglomerate (geology)|Conglomerate]]s, [[Sandstone]], clays related to  [[Paleosoils]], along with dolomitized [[Limestone]]. The Wazzant formation has a notorious proximal character compared to the Azilal formation.  These deposits fill in many small tear pools in the Atlas Central.<ref>Laville, E. (1978).

The predominantly terrigenous deposits of this formation suggest they were  deposited in continental setting, influenced by at least 6 different river channels, that trace it's path to the Atlas Gulf. On the [[Toarcian]]-[[Aalenian]] transgression, the High Atlas domain experienced a long process of extension and rifting, recorded by the presence of marine carbonates and shales, found on the Wazzant Formation Beds. It is related to the formation of the [[Atlantic Rifting]] to the west and of the formation of the [[Tethys Ocean]] to the north.<ref>El Harfi, A., Guiraud, M., & Lang, J. (2006).
