Wiley-Blackwell.</ref> Some have argued that the work of the Dominican [[Thomas Aquinas]] in the 13th century helped lay the groundwork for a shift in Christian doctrine, by which certain Christian theologians eventually began to accept the possibility of collaboration with devil(s), resulting in a person obtaining certain real supernatural powers.<ref>\"Christian theology underwent a major shift of attitude only during the 13th century. In his Summa contra Gentiles, Thomas Aquinas (1255\u201374) not only confirmed Augustine's semiotic theory, according to which spells, amulets or magical rituals indicated a secret pact with demons but gave the impression that sorcerers, through the support of the devil, could physically commit their crimes.\", Behringer, \"Witches and Witch-hunts: a Global History\", pp. 35\u201336 (2004). Wiley-Blackwell.</ref> That pagan superstition would be considered heretical is unsurprising, as any departure from the official positions of Rome could be considered a heresy, for instance, a definition of the relationships within the Trinity as seen in the much-vilified [[Arianism]]. But with witchcraft, fear and panic for certain Christian theologians, seems to grow in lockstep with the embrace of a new doctrinal position that it was actually possible for a ''person'' to obtain real supernatural power through a collaboration with the devil/s. James1's demonologies. \n\n[[File: Pre-1500 map spread.jpg|thumb|Dominican Inquisitors and the Growth of Witch-phobia]]\n\n===A branch of the inquisition in southern France===\nIn 1233, a papal bull by [[Gregory IX]] established a new branch of the inquisition in Toulouse, France, to be led by the [[Dominican Order|Dominicans]]. It was intended to prosecute Christian groups considered heretical, such as the [[Cathars]] and the [[Waldensians]].<ref> Charles Molinier, ''L'Inquisition dans le Midi de la France au XIIIe et au XIVe si\u00e8cle, \u00e9tude sur les sources de son Histoire'' (1880) p. ii.</ref> The Dominicans eventually evolved into the most zealous prosecutors of persons accused of witchcraft in the years leading up to the Reformation.\n\nRecords were usually kept by the French inquisitors but the majority of these did not survive, and one historian working in 1880, Charles Molinier, refers to the surviving records as only scanty debris.<ref>Molinier (1880) p. 6</ref> Molinier notes that the inquisitors themselves describe their attempts to carefully safeguard their records, especially when moving from town to town. The inquisitors were widely hated and would be ambushed on the road, but their records were more often the target than the inquisitors themselves [''plus d\u00e9sireux encore de ravir les papiers que porte le juge que de le faire p\u00e9rir lui-m\u00eame'']. The records seem to have often been targeted by the accused or their friends and family, wishing to thereby sabotage the proceedings or failing that, to spare their reputations and the reputations of their descendants.<ref>Molinier (1880) p. [https://play.google.com/books/reader?id=9pwaAAAAYAAJ&pg=GBS.PR16 xvi\u2013xviii].</ref> This would be all the more true of those accused of witchcraft. Difficulty in understanding the larger witchcraft trials to come in later centuries is deciding how much can be extrapolated from what remains.\n\n===14th century===\nIn 1329, with the papacy in nearby Avignon, the inquisitor of Carcassonne sentenced a monk to the dungeon for life and the sentence refers to...''multas et diversas daemonum conjurationes et invocationes''... and frequently uses the same Latin synonym for witch, ''sortilegia''\u2014found on the title page of [[Nicolas R\u00e9my]]'s [https://play.google.com/books/reader?id=GIYEomQYnxsC&pg=GBS.PP5 work from 1595], where it is claimed that 900 persons were executed for ''sortilegii crimen''.<ref> HC Lea, A History of the Inquisition, Vol III (1922) p. 455,657. Lea includes the entire 1329 sentence [https://play.google.com/books/reader?id=KAwNAAAAIAAJ&pg=GBS.PA657 reprinted in the original Latin]. A Francophone writer and contemporary of N Remy, [[Lambert Daneau]], considers \"sortilegus\" to have been shortened to become the French \"sorcier\" [https://play.google.com/books/reader?id=ygg6AAAAcAAJ&pg=GBS.PP14 De Veneficis Quos Olim Sortilegos (1575) p. 14] and ''sorciers'' was the term used in the title of another contemporary [[Jean Bodin]] in a witch-phobic work written in French in 1580. Bodin, De la Demonomanie des Sorciers ([https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=H359ziQd0kgC 1598 edition])</ref>\n\n===15th century trials and the growth of the new heterodox view===\nThe skeptical [[Canon Episcopi]] retained many supporters, and still seems to have been supported by the theological faculty at the University of Paris in their decree from 1398, and was never officially repudiated by a majority of bishops within the papal lands, nor even by the [[Council of Trent]], which immediately preceded the peak of the trials. But in 1428, the [[Valais witch trials]], lasting six to eight years, started in the French-speaking lower Valais and eventually spread to German-speaking regions. This time period also coincided with the [[Council of Basel]] (1431\u20131437) and some scholars have suggested a new witch-phobic doctrinal view may have spread among certain theologians and inquisitors in attendance at this council, as the Valais trials were discussed.<ref>[[#Thu01|Thurston 2001]]. p. 67,77.</ref> Not long after, a cluster of powerful opponents of the Canon Episcopi emerged: a Dominican inquisitor in Carcassonne named Jean Vinet, the Bishop of Avila Alfonso Tostado, and another Dominican Inquisitor named Nicholas Jacquier. It is unclear whether the three men were aware of each other's work. The coevolution of their shared view centres around \"a common challenge: disbelief in the reality of demonic activity in the world.\"<ref>Matthew Champion, Scourging the Temple of God ''Parergon'' (2011) 28.1 p 9-10.</ref>\n\nNicholas Jacquier's lengthy and complex argument against the Canon Episcopi was written in Latin. It began as a tract in 1452 and was expanded into a fuller monograph in 1458. Many copies seem to have been made by hand (nine manuscript copies still exist), but it was not printed until 1561.<ref>''[https://play.google.com/books/reader?id=fGtMAAAAcAAJ&pg=GBS.PA36 Flagellum Haereticorum Fascinariorum]'' p. 36.

Wiley-Blackwell.</ref> Jacquier describes a number of trials he personally witnessed, including one of a man named William Adeline, against whom the main charge seems to have been that he had preached a sermon in support of the Canon Episcopi\u2014claiming that witchcraft was merely an illusion. Adeline eventually recanted this view, most likely under torture.\n\n[[Image:Malleus maleficarum, K\u00f6ln 1520, Titelseite.jpg|thumb|Title page of the seventh [[Cologne]] edition of the ''[[Malleus Maleficarum]]'', 1520 (from the [[University of Sydney Library]]). The Latin title is \"''MALLEUS MALEFICARUM, Maleficas, & earum h\u00e6resim, ut phramea potentissima conterens.''\" (Generally translated into English as ''The Hammer of Witches which destroyeth Witches and their heresy as with a two-edged sword'').<ref>The English translation is from [http://www.malleusmaleficarum.org/notes/n192863.html this note] to [http://www.malleusmaleficarum.org/mm00c7.html Summers' 1928 introduction] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927225301/http://www.malleusmaleficarum.org/mm00c7.html |date=27 September 2007 }}.</ref>]]\n\n====1486: ''Malleus Maleficarum''====\nThe most important and influential book promoting the new heterodox view was the ''[[Malleus Maleficarum]]'' by [[Henricus Institoris|Heinrich Kramer]]. Kramer begins his work in opposition to the Canon Episcopi, but oddly, he does not cite Jacquier, and may not have been aware of his work.<ref>Attached to front of Kramer's book is the 1484 ''[[Summis desiderantes affectibus]]'', a [[papal bull]] of Pope Innocent VIII in which he approved the [[inquisition]] to move against witches who were explicitly accused of having \"slain infants yet in the mother's womb\" (abortion) and of \"hindering men from performing the sexual act and women from conceiving.\" [https://web.archive.org/web/20080523174317/http://www.malleusmaleficarum.org/mm00e.html ''The Bull of Innocent VIII''] see [[Malleus Maleficarum]] translation by [[Montague Summers]].</ref> Like most witch-phobic writers, Kramer had met strong resistance by those who opposed his heterodox view; this inspired him to write his work as both propaganda and a manual for like-minded zealots. The [[Gutenberg printing press]] had only recently been invented along the Rhine River, and Kramer fully utilized it to shepherd his work into print and spread the ideas that had developed by inquisitors and theologians in France into the Rhineland.<ref>See 2004 essay by Wolfgang Behringer on [http://friedo.szm.com/mm.pdf Malleus Maleficarum] \"first printed in...

Also well-known were the Scottish [[North Berwick witch trials]], Swedish [[Tors\u00e5ker witch trials]] and, somewhat later, in 1692, the [[Salem witch trials]] in New England. \n\nIn 1590, the North Berwick witch trials occurred in Scotland, and were of particular note as the king, [[James I of England|James VI]], became involved himself. James had developed a fear that witches planned to kill him after he suffered from storms while traveling to Denmark in order to claim his bride, [[Anne of Denmark|Anne]], earlier that year. Returning to Scotland, the king heard of trials that were occurring in [[North Berwick]], and ordered the suspects to be brought to him\u2014he subsequently believed that a nobleman, [[Francis Stewart, 5th Earl of Bothwell]], was a witch, and after the latter fled in fear of his life, he was outlawed as a traitor. The king subsequently set up royal commissions to hunt down witches in his realm, recommending torture in dealing with suspects, and in 1597, he wrote a book about the menace that witches posed to society, entitled ''[[Daemonologie]]''.<ref>[[#Thu01|Thurston 2001]], pp. 80\u201381.</ref>\nAlso in Italy a great number of trials against women started in these years, where, between the others, lives a woman: \"Donna Prudentia\" a special type.

In the Nordic countries, the late 17th century saw the peak of the trials in a number of areas: the [[Tors\u00e5ker witch trials]] of [[Swedish Empire|Sweden]] (1674), where 71 people were executed for witchcraft in a single day, the peak of witch hunting in Swedish Finland,<ref name=\"Thurston 2001 Page 79\"/> and the [[Salzburg witch trials]] in Austria (where 139 people were executed from 1675\u20131690).\n\nThe 1692 [[Salem witch trials]] were a brief outburst of witch-phobia in the New World when the practice was waning in Europe. In the 1690s, Winifred King Benham and her daughter Winifred were thrice tried for witchcraft in [[Wallingford, Connecticut]], the last of such trials in New England.

The [[Witchcraft Act of 1735]] put an end of the traditional form of witchcraft as a legal offense in Britain.

Early estimates tend to be highly exaggerated, as they were still part of rhetorical arguments against the persecution of witches rather than purely historical scholarship. \n\nNotably, a figure of nine million victims was given by [[Gottfried Christian Voigt]] in 1784 in an argument criticizing [[Voltaire]]'s estimate of \"several hundred thousand\" as too low.

One of the earliest individuals to do so was the American [[Matilda Joslyn Gage]], a writer who was deeply involved in the [[First-wave feminism|first-wave feminist]] movement for [[women's suffrage]]. In 1893, she published the book ''Woman, Church and State'', which was \"written in a tearing hurry and in time snatched from a political activism which left no space for original research\".<ref name=\"Hutton 1999 Page 141\">[[#Hut99|Hutton 1999]]. p. 141.</ref> Likely influenced by the works of [[Jules Michelet]] about the Witch-Cult, she claimed that the witches persecuted in the Early Modern period were pagan priestesses adhering to an [[Great Goddess hypothesis|ancient religion venerating a Great Goddess]]. She also repeated the erroneous statement, taken from the works of several German authors, that nine million people had been killed in the witch hunt.<ref name=\"Hutton 1999 Page 141\"/> The United States has become the centre of development for these feminist interpretations.{{sfn|Scarre|Callow|2001|pp=57\u201358}}\n\nIn 1973, two American second-wave feminists, [[Barbara Ehrenreich]] and [[Deirdre English]], published an extended pamphlet in which they put forward the idea that the women persecuted had been the traditional healers and midwives of the community, who were being deliberately eliminated by the male medical establishment.{{sfnm|1a1=Purkiss|1y=1996|1pp=19\u201320|2a1=Hutton|2y=1999|2p=342|3a1=Ehrenreich|3a2=English|3y=2010}} This theory disregarded the fact that the majority of those persecuted were neither healers nor midwives, and that in various parts of Europe these individuals were commonly among those encouraging the persecutions.{{sfn|Purkiss|1996|p=8}} In 1994, Anne Llewellyn Barstow published her book ''Witchcraze'',{{sfn|Barstow|1994}} which was later described by Scarre and Callow as \"perhaps the most successful\" attempt to portray the trials as a systematic male attack on women.{{sfn|Scarre|Callow|2001|p=75}}\n\nOther feminist historians have rejected this interpretation of events; historian [[Diane Purkiss]] described it as \"not politically helpful\" because it constantly portrays women as \"helpless victims of patriarchy\" and thus does not aid them in contemporary feminist struggles.{{sfn|Purkiss|1996|p=17}} She also condemned it for factual inaccuracy by highlighting that radical feminists adhering to it ignore the [[historicity]] of their claims, instead promoting it because it is perceived as authorising the continued struggle against patriarchal society.{{sfn|Purkiss|1996|pp=11, 16}} She asserted that many radical feminists nonetheless clung to it because of its \"mythic significance\" and firmly delineated structure between the oppressor and the oppressed.{{sfn|Purkiss|1996|p=8}}\n\n===Gender conflict and reaction to earlier feminist studies===\nAn estimated 75% to 85% of those accused in the early modern witch trials were women,<ref name=\"ScarreCallow80\">Per {{harvtxt|Scarre|Callow|2001}}, \"Records suggest that in Europe, as a whole, about 80 per cent of trial defendants were women, though the ratio of women to men charged with the offence varied from place to place, and often, too, in one place over time.\"</ref><ref name=\"GibbonsRecent\">Gibbons, Jenny (1998) [https://web.archive.org/web/20070203210023/http://chass.colostate-pueblo.edu/natrel/pom/old/POM5a1.html] \"Recent Developments in the Study of the Great European Witch Hunt\"] in ''The Pomegranate'' No. 5, Lammas 1998.</ref><ref>\nAccording to R.

In Early Modern Europe, it was widely believed that women were less intelligent than men and more susceptible to sin.{{sfnm|1a1=Scarre|1a2=Callow|1y=2001|1p=59|2a1=Thurston|2y=2001|2pp=42\u201345}}\nMany modern scholars argue that the witch hunts cannot be explained simplistically as an expression of male misogyny, as indeed women were frequently accused by other women,<ref>'the theory that witch-hunting equals misogyny is embarrassed by the predominance of women witness against the accused', Purkis, 'The Witch in History', p. 92 (1996); Purkis provides detailed examples, and also demonstrates how some documents have been misread in a manner which attributes accusations or legal prosecution to men, when in fact the action was brought by a woman.\n\"More numerous than midwives among the accused were women who were engaged in caring for other women's children. Lyndal Roper has shown that many witchcraft accusations in Ausburg in the late sixteenth and early 17th century arose out of conflicts between mothers and the lying-in maids who provided care for them and their infants for a number of weeks after birth. It was not unnatural for the mothers to project their anxieties about their own health, as well as the precarious health of their infants, on to these women. When some misfortune did occur, therefore, the lying-in maids were highly vulnerable to charges of having deprived the baby of nourishment or of having killed it. What is interesting about these accusations is that they originated in tensions among women rather than between men and women. The same can be said regarding many other accusations made against women for harming young children.\", Levack, ''The Witch-Hunt in Early Modern Europe'', p. 140 (2nd edition 1995)</ref><ref name=\"Gibbons 1998\">[[#Gib98|Gibbons 1998]].</ref> to the point that witch-hunts, at least at the local level of villages, have been described as having been driven primarily by \"women's quarrels\".<ref name=\"Briggs\">\"In Lorraine the majority were men, particularly when other men were on trial, yet women did testify in large numbers against other women, making up 43 per cent of witnesses in these cases on average, and predominating in 30 per cent of them.\", Briggs, 'Witches & Neighbors: The Social and Cultural Context of European Witchcraft', p. 264 (1998). \"It appears that women were active in building up reputations by gossip, deploying counter-magic and accusing suspects; crystallization into formal prosecution, however, needed the intervention of men, preferably of fairly high status in the community.\", ibid., p. 265. \"The number of witchcraft quarrels that began between women may actually have been higher; in some cases, it appears that the husband as 'head of household' came forward to make statements on behalf of his wife, although the central quarrel had taken place between her and another woman.\", Willis, ''Malevolent Nature'', p. 36 (1995). \"In Peter Rushton's examination of slander cases in the Durham church courts, women took action against other women who had labeled them witches in 61 percent of the cases.\", ibid., p. 36. \"J.A.

The first to advance this theory was the German Professor of Criminal Law [[Karl Ernst Jarcke]] of the [[University of Berlin]], who put forward the idea in 1828; he suggested that witchcraft had been a pre-Christian German religion that had degenerated into Satanism.{{sfnm|1a1=Cohn|1y=1975|1pp=103\u2013104|2a1=Purkiss|2y=1996|2p=34|3a1=Hutton|3y=1999|3p=136}} Jarcke's ideas were picked up by the German historian [[Franz Josef Mone]] in 1839, although he argued that the cult's origins were Greek rather than Germanic.{{sfnm|1a1=Cohn|1y=1975|1p=104|2a1=Hutton|2y=1999|2pp=136\u2013137}}\n\nIn 1862, the Frenchman [[Jules Michelet]] published ''[[Satanism and Witchcraft|La Sorciere]]'', in which he put forth the idea that the witches had been following a pagan religion. The theory achieved greater attention when it was taken up by the Egyptologist [[Margaret Murray]], who published both ''The Witch-Cult in Western Europe'' (1921) and ''The God of the Witches'' (1931) in which she claimed that the witches had been following a pre-Christian religion which she termed \"the Witch-Cult\" and \"Ritual Witchcraft\". \n\n{{main|Witch-cult hypothesis}}\n\nMurray claimed that this faith was devoted to a pagan [[Horned God]] and involved the celebration of four Witches' Sabbaths each year: [[Halloween]], [[Imbolc]], [[Beltane]], and [[Lughnasadh]].{{sfnm|1a1=Murray|1y=1952|2a1=Murray|2a2=1962}} However, the majority of scholarly reviews of Murray's work produced at the time were largely critical,{{sfn|Sheppard|2013|p=169}} and her books never received support from experts in the Early Modern witch trials.{{sfn|Hutton|1999|p=198}} Instead, from her early publications onward many of her ideas were challenged by those who highlighted her \"factual errors and methodological failings\".{{sfn|Eliade|1975|p=152}}\n\n{{quote box | width = 30% | align = left\n| quote = We Neopagans now face a crisis.

He also went on to write several books about the historical Witch-Cult, ''[[Witchcraft Today]]'' (1954) and ''[[The Meaning of Witchcraft]]'' (1959), and in these books, Gardner used the phrase \"the burning times\" in reference to the European and North American witch trials.<ref>[[#Gar54|Gardner 1954]]. p. 139.</ref>\n\nIn the early 20th century, a number of individuals and groups emerged in Europe, primarily Britain, and subsequently the United States as well, claiming to be the surviving remnants of the pagan Witch-Cult described in the works of Margaret Murray. The first of these actually appeared in the last few years of the 19th century, being a manuscript that American folklorist [[Charles Leland]] claimed he had been given by a woman who was a member of a group of witches worshipping the god [[Lucifer]] and goddess [[Diana (mythology)|Diana]] in [[Tuscany]], Italy. He published the work in 1899 as ''[[Aradia, or the Gospel of the Witches]]''. Whilst historians and folklorists have accepted that there are folkloric elements to the gospel, none have accepted it as being the text of a genuine Tuscan religious group, and believe it to be of late-nineteenth-century composition.<ref>See for instance [[#Hut99|Hutton 1999]]. pp. 142\u2013148 and [[#Mag02|Magliocco 2002]].</ref>\n\nWiccans extended claims regarding the witch-cult in various ways, for instance by utilising the British folklore associating witches with prehistoric sites to assert that the witch-cult used to use such locations for religious rites, in doing so legitimising contemporary Wiccan use of them.{{sfn|Doyle White|2014|p=68}}\nBy the 1990s, many Wiccans had come to recognise the inaccuracy of the witch-cult theory and had accepted it as a mythological origin

In Italy, witch trials were comparatively rare and did not involve torture and executions.\" Anne L. Barstow, ''Witchcraze : a New History of the European Witch Hunts'', HarperCollins, 1995.</ref>\n\n==Medieval background==\n===An unsettling of Christian doctrine toward a belief in witchcraft===\nThroughout the medieval era, mainstream Christian doctrine had denied the existence of witches and witchcraft, condemning it as pagan superstition.<ref>\"Clearly, there was an increase in sceptical voices during the Carolingian period, even if we take into account an increase in surviving sources.\", Behringer, \"Witches and Witch-hunts: a Global History\", p. 31 (2004). Wiley-Blackwell.</ref> Some have argued that the work of the Dominican [[Thomas Aquinas]] in the 13th century helped lay the groundwork for a shift in Christian doctrine, by which certain Christian theologians eventually began to accept the possibility of collaboration with devil(s), resulting in a person obtaining certain real supernatural powers.<ref>\"Christian theology underwent a major shift of attitude only during the 13th century. In his Summa contra Gentiles, Thomas Aquinas (1255\u201374) not only confirmed Augustine's semiotic theory, according to which spells, amulets or magical rituals indicated a secret pact with demons but gave the impression that sorcerers, through the support of the devil, could physically commit their crimes.\", Behringer, \"Witches and Witch-hunts: a Global History\", pp. 35\u201336 (2004). Wiley-Blackwell.</ref> That pagan superstition would be considered heretical is unsurprising, as any departure from the official positions of Rome could be considered a heresy, for instance, a definition of the relationships within the Trinity as seen in the much-vilified [[Arianism]]. But with witchcraft, fear and panic for certain Christian theologians, seems to grow in lockstep with the embrace of a new doctrinal position that it was actually possible for a ''person'' to obtain real supernatural power through a collaboration with the devil/s. James1's demonologies. \n\n[[File: Pre-1500 map spread.jpg|thumb|Dominican Inquisitors and the Growth of Witch-phobia]]\n\n===A branch of the inquisition in southern France===\nIn 1233, a papal bull by [[Gregory IX]] established a new branch of the inquisition in Toulouse, France, to be led by the [[Dominican Order|Dominicans]]. It was intended to prosecute Christian groups considered heretical, such as the [[Cathars]] and the [[Waldensians]].<ref> Charles Molinier, ''L'Inquisition dans le Midi de la France au XIIIe et au XIVe si\u00e8cle, \u00e9tude sur les sources de son Histoire'' (1880) p. ii.</ref> The Dominicans eventually evolved into the most zealous prosecutors of persons accused of witchcraft in the years leading up to the Reformation.\n\nRecords were usually kept by the French inquisitors but the majority of these did not survive, and one historian working in 1880, Charles Molinier, refers to the surviving records as only scanty debris.<ref>Molinier (1880) p. 6</ref> Molinier notes that the inquisitors themselves describe their attempts to carefully safeguard their records, especially when moving from town to town. The inquisitors were widely hated and would be ambushed on the road, but their records were more often the target than the inquisitors themselves [''plus d\u00e9sireux encore de ravir les papiers que porte le juge que de le faire p\u00e9rir lui-m\u00eame'']. The records seem to have often been targeted by the accused or their friends and family, wishing to thereby sabotage the proceedings or failing that, to spare their reputations and the reputations of their descendants.<ref>Molinier (1880) p. [https://play.google.com/books/reader?id=9pwaAAAAYAAJ&pg=GBS.PR16 xvi\u2013xviii].</ref> This would be all the more true of those accused of witchcraft. Difficulty in understanding the larger witchcraft trials to come in later centuries is deciding how much can be extrapolated from what remains.\n\n===14th century===\nIn 1329, with the papacy in nearby Avignon, the inquisitor of Carcassonne sentenced a monk to the dungeon for life and the sentence refers to...''multas et diversas daemonum conjurationes et invocationes''... and frequently uses the same Latin synonym for witch, ''sortilegia''\u2014found on the title page of [[Nicolas R\u00e9my]]'s [https://play.google.com/books/reader?id=GIYEomQYnxsC&pg=GBS.PP5 work from 1595], where it is claimed that 900 persons were executed for ''sortilegii crimen''.<ref> HC Lea, A History of the Inquisition, Vol III (1922) p. 455,657. Lea includes the entire 1329 sentence [https://play.google.com/books/reader?id=KAwNAAAAIAAJ&pg=GBS.PA657 reprinted in the original Latin]. A Francophone writer and contemporary of N Remy, [[Lambert Daneau]], considers \"sortilegus\" to have been shortened to become the French \"sorcier\" [https://play.google.com/books/reader?id=ygg6AAAAcAAJ&pg=GBS.PP14 De Veneficis Quos Olim Sortilegos (1575) p. 14] and ''sorciers'' was the term used in the title of another contemporary [[Jean Bodin]] in a witch-phobic work written in French in 1580. Bodin, De la Demonomanie des Sorciers ([https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=H359ziQd0kgC 1598 edition])</ref>\n\n===15th century trials and the growth of the new heterodox view===\nThe skeptical [[Canon Episcopi]] retained many supporters, and still seems to have been supported by the theological faculty at the University of Paris in their decree from 1398, and was never officially repudiated by a majority of bishops within the papal lands, nor even by the [[Council of Trent]], which immediately preceded the peak of the trials. But in 1428, the [[Valais witch trials]], lasting six to eight years, started in the French-speaking lower Valais and eventually spread to German-speaking regions. This time period also coincided with the [[Council of Basel]] (1431\u20131437) and some scholars have suggested a new witch-phobic doctrinal view may have spread among certain theologians and inquisitors in attendance at this council, as the Valais trials were discussed.<ref>[[#Thu01|Thurston 2001]]. p. 67,77.</ref> Not long after, a cluster of powerful opponents of the Canon Episcopi emerged: a Dominican inquisitor in Carcassonne named Jean Vinet, the Bishop of Avila Alfonso Tostado, and another Dominican Inquisitor named Nicholas Jacquier. It is unclear whether the three men were aware of each other's work. The coevolution of their shared view centres around \"a common challenge: disbelief in the reality of demonic activity in the world.\"<ref>Matthew Champion, Scourging the Temple of God ''Parergon'' (2011) 28.1 p 9-10.</ref>\n\nNicholas Jacquier's lengthy and complex argument against the Canon Episcopi was written in Latin. It began as a tract in 1452 and was expanded into a fuller monograph in 1458. Many copies seem to have been made by hand (nine manuscript copies still exist), but it was not printed until 1561.<ref>''[https://play.google.com/books/reader?id=fGtMAAAAcAAJ&pg=GBS.PA36 Flagellum Haereticorum Fascinariorum]'' p. 36.

Wiley-Blackwell.</ref> Jacquier describes a number of trials he personally witnessed, including one of a man named William Adeline, against whom the main charge seems to have been that he had preached a sermon in support of the Canon Episcopi\u2014claiming that witchcraft was merely an illusion. Adeline eventually recanted this view, most likely under torture.\n\n[[Image:Malleus maleficarum, K\u00f6ln 1520, Titelseite.jpg|thumb|Title page of the seventh [[Cologne]] edition of the ''[[Malleus Maleficarum]]'', 1520 (from the [[University of Sydney Library]]). The Latin title is \"''MALLEUS MALEFICARUM, Maleficas, & earum h\u00e6resim, ut phramea potentissima conterens.''\" (Generally translated into English as ''The Hammer of Witches which destroyeth Witches and their heresy as with a two-edged sword'').<ref>The English translation is from [http://www.malleusmaleficarum.org/notes/n192863.html this note] to [http://www.malleusmaleficarum.org/mm00c7.html Summers' 1928 introduction] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927225301/http://www.malleusmaleficarum.org/mm00c7.html |date=27 September 2007 }}.</ref>]]\n\n====1486: ''Malleus Maleficarum''====\nThe most important and influential book promoting the new heterodox view was the ''[[Malleus Maleficarum]]'' by [[Henricus Institoris|Heinrich Kramer]]. Kramer begins his work in opposition to the Canon Episcopi, but oddly, he does not cite Jacquier, and may not have been aware of his work.<ref>Attached to front of Kramer's book is the 1484 ''[[Summis desiderantes affectibus]]'', a [[papal bull]] of Pope Innocent VIII in which he approved the [[inquisition]] to move against witches who were explicitly accused of having \"slain infants yet in the mother's womb\" (abortion) and of \"hindering men from performing the sexual act and women from conceiving.\" [https://web.archive.org/web/20080523174317/http://www.malleusmaleficarum.org/mm00e.html ''The Bull of Innocent VIII''] see [[Malleus Maleficarum]] translation by [[Montague Summers]].</ref> Like most witch-phobic writers, Kramer had met strong resistance by those who opposed his heterodox view; this inspired him to write his work as both propaganda and a manual for like-minded zealots. The [[Gutenberg printing press]] had only recently been invented along the Rhine River, and Kramer fully utilized it to shepherd his work into print and spread the ideas that had developed by inquisitors and theologians in France into the Rhineland.<ref>See 2004 essay by Wolfgang Behringer on [http://friedo.szm.com/mm.pdf Malleus Maleficarum] \"first printed in... Speyer, by then a medium sized town on the Rhine.\"</ref> ''Malleus Maleficarum'' was printed 13 times between 1486\u20131520, and\u2014following a very curious 50-year pause that coincided with the height of the Protestant Reformation\u2014it was printed again another 16 times, following the [[Council of Trent]] (1574\u20131669). It inspired many similar works, such as an influential work by [[Jean Bodin]], and was cited as late as 1692 by [[Increase Mather]], then president of Harvard College.<ref>Increase Mather, Cases Concerning Evil Spirits p. 272 Appended to his son's book, [https://play.google.com/books/reader?id=-hjcroqWQ1AC&pg=GBS.PA272 Wonders of the Invisible World], (1693)</ref><ref>Behringer, \"Witches and Witch-hunts: a Global History\", p. 19 (2004).

Behringer, \"Witches and Witch-hunts: a Global History\", p. 21 (2004).</ref>\n\nIt is unknown if a degree of alarm at the extreme superstition and witch-phobia expressed by Kramer in the ''Malleus Maleficarum'' may have been one of the numerous factors that helped prepare the ground for the [[Protestant Reformation]].\n\n==Peak of the trials: 1560\u20131630==\nThe period of the European witch trials, with the largest number of fatalities, seems to have occurred between 1560 and 1630<ref name=\"Thurston 2001 Page 79\">[[#Thu01|Thurston 2001]]. p. 79.</ref> including the [[Trier witch trials]] (1581\u20131593), the [[Fulda witch trials]] (1603\u20131606), the [[Basque witch trials]] (1609\u20131611), the [[W\u00fcrzburg witch trial]] (1626\u20131631), and the [[Bamberg witch trials]] (1626\u20131631). Also well-known were the Scottish [[North Berwick witch trials]], Swedish [[Tors\u00e5ker witch trials]] and, somewhat later, in 1692, the [[Salem witch trials]] in New England. \n\nIn 1590, the North Berwick witch trials occurred in Scotland, and were of particular note as the king, [[James I of England|James VI]], became involved himself. James had developed a fear that witches planned to kill him after he suffered from storms while traveling to Denmark in order to claim his bride, [[Anne of Denmark|Anne]], earlier that year. Returning to Scotland, the king heard of trials that were occurring in [[North Berwick]], and ordered the suspects to be brought to him\u2014he subsequently believed that a nobleman, [[Francis Stewart, 5th Earl of Bothwell]], was a witch, and after the latter fled in fear of his life, he was outlawed as a traitor. The king subsequently set up royal commissions to hunt down witches in his realm, recommending torture in dealing with suspects, and in 1597, he wrote a book about the menace that witches posed to society, entitled ''[[Daemonologie]]''.<ref>[[#Thu01|Thurston 2001]], pp. 80\u201381.</ref>\nAlso in Italy a great number of trials against women started in these years, where, between the others, lives a woman: \"Donna Prudentia\" a special type. On the original documents examined by a legal expert, we can read the word: \"Lamia\". As the others european witches, she was considered an outlaw.<ref>[[For more informations and a comparative study between real trials in Italy and Europe, read: Monia Montechiarini, Stregoneria Crimine Femminile.

In 1635, the authorities of the [[Roman Inquisition]] acknowledged its own trials had \"found scarcely one trial conducted legally\".<ref>\"even the Roman Inquisition recognized that abuses were common; in 1635 it admitted that \"the Inquisition has found scarcely one trial conducted legally.\"\", Midelfort, \"Witch hunting in southwestern Germany, 1562\u20131684: the social and intellectual foundations\", p. 28 (1972).</ref> In the middle of the 17th century, the difficulty in proving witchcraft according to the legal process contributed to the councilors of [[Rothenburg ob der Tauber|Rothenburg]] (German) following advice to treat witchcraft cases with caution.<ref>\"Doubts about their ability to prove witches unequivocally guilty according to due legal procedure, fears that they would invoke God's wrath against themselves and their subjects if they overstepped its bounds, and a certain humility in thinking that witchcraft was a matter best left up to God, all played a part in encouraging the Rothenburg councillors and their advisers to handle witchcraft cases with caution.\", Rowlands, 'Witchcraft narratives in Germany: Rothenburg 1561\u20131652', p. 59 (2003). \"Compelling legal reasons almost always also existed in specific cases to discourage the councillors and their advisers from taking action against sabbat-attenders.\", Rowlands, 'Witchcraft narratives in Germany: Rothenburg 1561\u20131652', p. 57 (2003).</ref>\n\nAlthough the witch trials had begun to fade out across much of Europe by the mid-17th century, they continued on the fringes of Europe and in the American Colonies. In the Nordic countries, the late 17th century saw the peak of the trials in a number of areas: the [[Tors\u00e5ker witch trials]] of [[Swedish Empire|Sweden]] (1674), where 71 people were executed for witchcraft in a single day, the peak of witch hunting in Swedish Finland,<ref name=\"Thurston 2001 Page 79\"/> and the [[Salzburg witch trials]] in Austria (where 139 people were executed from 1675\u20131690).\n\nThe 1692 [[Salem witch trials]] were a brief outburst of witch-phobia in the New World when the practice was waning in Europe.

One of the earliest individuals to do so was the American [[Matilda Joslyn Gage]], a writer who was deeply involved in the [[First-wave feminism|first-wave feminist]] movement for [[women's suffrage]]. In 1893, she published the book ''Woman, Church and State'', which was \"written in a tearing hurry and in time snatched from a political activism which left no space for original research\".<ref name=\"Hutton 1999 Page 141\">[[#Hut99|Hutton 1999]]. p. 141.</ref> Likely influenced by the works of [[Jules Michelet]] about the Witch-Cult, she claimed that the witches persecuted in the Early Modern period were pagan priestesses adhering to an [[Great Goddess hypothesis|ancient religion venerating a Great Goddess]]. She also repeated the erroneous statement, taken from the works of several German authors, that nine million people had been killed in the witch hunt.<ref name=\"Hutton 1999 Page 141\"/> The United States has become the centre of development for these feminist interpretations.{{sfn|Scarre|Callow|2001|pp=57\u201358}}\n\nIn 1973, two American second-wave feminists, [[Barbara Ehrenreich]] and [[Deirdre English]], published an extended pamphlet in which they put forward the idea that the women persecuted had been the traditional healers and midwives of the community, who were being deliberately eliminated by the male medical establishment.{{sfnm|1a1=Purkiss|1y=1996|1pp=19\u201320|2a1=Hutton|2y=1999|2p=342|3a1=Ehrenreich|3a2=English|3y=2010}} This theory disregarded the fact that the majority of those persecuted were neither healers nor midwives, and that in various parts of Europe these individuals were commonly among those encouraging the persecutions.{{sfn|Purkiss|1996|p=8}} In 1994, Anne Llewellyn Barstow published her book ''Witchcraze'',{{sfn|Barstow|1994}} which was later described by Scarre and Callow as \"perhaps the most successful\" attempt to portray the trials as a systematic male attack on women.{{sfn|Scarre|Callow|2001|p=75}}\n\nOther feminist historians have rejected this interpretation of events; historian [[Diane Purkiss]] described it as \"not politically helpful\" because it constantly portrays women as \"helpless victims of patriarchy\" and thus does not aid them in contemporary feminist struggles.{{sfn|Purkiss|1996|p=17}} She also condemned it for factual inaccuracy by highlighting that radical feminists adhering to it ignore the [[historicity]] of their claims, instead promoting it because it is perceived as authorising the continued struggle against patriarchal society.{{sfn|Purkiss|1996|pp=11, 16}} She asserted that many radical feminists nonetheless clung to it because of its \"mythic significance\" and firmly delineated structure between the oppressor and the oppressed.{{sfn|Purkiss|1996|p=8}}\n\n===Gender conflict and reaction to earlier feminist studies===\nAn estimated 75% to 85% of those accused in the early modern witch trials were women,<ref name=\"ScarreCallow80\">Per {{harvtxt|Scarre|Callow|2001}}, \"Records suggest that in Europe, as a whole, about 80 per cent of trial defendants were women, though the ratio of women to men charged with the offence varied from place to place, and often, too, in one place over time.\"</ref><ref name=\"GibbonsRecent\">Gibbons, Jenny (1998) [https://web.archive.org/web/20070203210023/http://chass.colostate-pueblo.edu/natrel/pom/old/POM5a1.html] \"Recent Developments in the Study of the Great European Witch Hunt\"] in ''The Pomegranate'' No. 5, Lammas 1998.</ref><ref>\nAccording to R.

Lyndal Roper has shown that many witchcraft accusations in Ausburg in the late sixteenth and early 17th century arose out of conflicts between mothers and the lying-in maids who provided care for them and their infants for a number of weeks after birth. It was not unnatural for the mothers to project their anxieties about their own health, as well as the precarious health of their infants, on to these women. When some misfortune did occur, therefore, the lying-in maids were highly vulnerable to charges of having deprived the baby of nourishment or of having killed it. What is interesting about these accusations is that they originated in tensions among women rather than between men and women. The same can be said regarding many other accusations made against women for harming young children.\", Levack, ''The Witch-Hunt in Early Modern Europe'', p. 140 (2nd edition 1995)</ref><ref name=\"Gibbons 1998\">[[#Gib98|Gibbons 1998]].</ref> to the point that witch-hunts, at least at the local level of villages, have been described as having been driven primarily by \"women's quarrels\".<ref name=\"Briggs\">\"In Lorraine the majority were men, particularly when other men were on trial, yet women did testify in large numbers against other women, making up 43 per cent of witnesses in these cases on average, and predominating in 30 per cent of them.\", Briggs, 'Witches & Neighbors: The Social and Cultural Context of European Witchcraft', p. 264 (1998). \"It appears that women were active in building up reputations by gossip, deploying counter-magic and accusing suspects; crystallization into formal prosecution, however, needed the intervention of men, preferably of fairly high status in the community.\", ibid., p. 265. \"The number of witchcraft quarrels that began between women may actually have been higher; in some cases, it appears that the husband as 'head of household' came forward to make statements on behalf of his wife, although the central quarrel had taken place between her and another woman.\", Willis, ''Malevolent Nature'', p. 36 (1995). \"In Peter Rushton's examination of slander cases in the Durham church courts, women took action against other women who had labeled them witches in 61 percent of the cases.\", ibid., p. 36. \"J.A.

The first to advance this theory was the German Professor of Criminal Law [[Karl Ernst Jarcke]] of the [[University of Berlin]], who put forward the idea in 1828; he suggested that witchcraft had been a pre-Christian German religion that had degenerated into Satanism.{{sfnm|1a1=Cohn|1y=1975|1pp=103\u2013104|2a1=Purkiss|2y=1996|2p=34|3a1=Hutton|3y=1999|3p=136}} Jarcke's ideas were picked up by the German historian [[Franz Josef Mone]] in 1839, although he argued that the cult's origins were Greek rather than Germanic.{{sfnm|1a1=Cohn|1y=1975|1p=104|2a1=Hutton|2y=1999|2pp=136\u2013137}}\n\nIn 1862, the Frenchman [[Jules Michelet]] published ''[[Satanism and Witchcraft|La Sorciere]]'', in which he put forth the idea that the witches had been following a pagan religion. The theory achieved greater attention when it was taken up by the Egyptologist [[Margaret Murray]], who published both ''The Witch-Cult in Western Europe'' (1921) and ''The God of the Witches'' (1931) in which she claimed that the witches had been following a pre-Christian religion which she termed \"the Witch-Cult\" and \"Ritual Witchcraft\". \n\n{{main|Witch-cult hypothesis}}\n\nMurray claimed that this faith was devoted to a pagan [[Horned God]] and involved the celebration of four Witches' Sabbaths each year: [[Halloween]], [[Imbolc]], [[Beltane]], and [[Lughnasadh]].{{sfnm|1a1=Murray|1y=1952|2a1=Murray|2a2=1962}} However, the majority of scholarly reviews of Murray's work produced at the time were largely critical,{{sfn|Sheppard|2013|p=169}} and her books never received support from experts in the Early Modern witch trials.{{sfn|Hutton|1999|p=198}} Instead, from her early publications onward many of her ideas were challenged by those who highlighted her \"factual errors and methodological failings\".{{sfn|Eliade|1975|p=152}}\n\n{{quote box | width = 30% | align = left\n| quote = We Neopagans now face a crisis.

He also went on to write several books about the historical Witch-Cult, ''[[Witchcraft Today]]'' (1954) and ''[[The Meaning of Witchcraft]]'' (1959), and in these books, Gardner used the phrase \"the burning times\" in reference to the European and North American witch trials.<ref>[[#Gar54|Gardner 1954]]. p. 139.</ref>\n\nIn the early 20th century, a number of individuals and groups emerged in Europe, primarily Britain, and subsequently the United States as well, claiming to be the surviving remnants of the pagan Witch-Cult described in the works of Margaret Murray. The first of these actually appeared in the last few years of the 19th century, being a manuscript that American folklorist [[Charles Leland]] claimed he had been given by a woman who was a member of a group of witches worshipping the god [[Lucifer]] and goddess [[Diana (mythology)|Diana]] in [[Tuscany]], Italy. He published the work in 1899 as ''[[Aradia, or the Gospel of the Witches]]''. Whilst historians and folklorists have accepted that there are folkloric elements to the gospel, none have accepted it as being the text of a genuine Tuscan religious group, and believe it to be of late-nineteenth-century composition.<ref>See for instance [[#Hut99|Hutton 1999]]. pp. 142\u2013148 and [[#Mag02|Magliocco 2002]].</ref>\n\nWiccans extended claims regarding the witch-cult in various ways, for instance by utilising the British folklore associating witches with prehistoric sites to assert that the witch-cult used to use such locations for religious rites, in doing so legitimising contemporary Wiccan use of them.{{sfn|Doyle White|2014|p=68}}\nBy the 1990s, many Wiccans had come to recognise the inaccuracy of the witch-cult theory and had accepted it as a mythological origin

The [[camp (style)|camp]] [[lyrics]] are intended as self-parody, and can be seen as either humorous, or offensive by those who take them at face value, for their often [[lascivious]] and [[misogyny|misogynist]] tone.

Lyrical content also exhibits a send up of [[cult]] [[worship]], often of Zodiac Mindwarp's self-proclaimed raging [[libido]], with Mindwarp claiming the titles 'Sex Fuhrer', 'Love Dictator', and 'High Priest of Love'.\n\n==Overview==\nThe [[band (music)#Rock and pop bands|band]] is the brainchild of Mark Manning, a former [[graphic designer|graphic artist]]<ref name=\"LarkinHM\"/> and art editor of the now defunct ''[[Flexipop|Flexipop!]]'' magazine. The magazine folded back in 1982 but the hedonistic lifestyle of the frequenting rock and pop stars to the magazine' offices fueled his desire to experience the debauchery of life as a decadent [[rock music|rock]] star. He joined another music publication called ''Metal Fury'' as a graphic designer but assumed the alter ego 'Zodiac Mindwarp' at night. 'Zodiac Mindwarp' was the namesake of a series of underground comics written and illustrated by Spain Rodriquez. Zodiac soon left Metal Fury and formed the Love Reaction in 1985 with [[Jimmy Cauty]] (who later formed [[The Orb]], [[The Justified Ancients of Mu Mu]] and [[The KLF]]) on guitar; [[Kid Chaos]] (real name Stephen Harris) on bass; and Boom Boom Kaboomski on drums.\n\nThe band was signed to the Food label of Phonogram Records who soon issued their first recording, \"Wild Child\" with just Zodiac (playing guitar and vocals), Kid Chaos on bass and Jake Le Mesurier on drums. A demo version of \"High Priest of Love\" was included on the ''[[Melody Maker]]'' ''Vinyl Conflict 2'' free EP in September 1986. By the end of the year the lineup had changed again to accommodate the still present figure of Cobalt Stargazer (real name Geoff Bird) and new drummer Slam Thunderhide (real name Stephen Landrum). That lineup contributed the studio track, \"Drug Shoes,\" to the FOOD ''Imminent 2'' various artists compilation.\n\nAt various times, the band has also featured Evil Bastard (real name Robert Munro who co-penned and sang on two [[A-side and B-side|B-sides]]: \"Hangover from Hell\" and \"Lager Woman from Hell\"), Heavy Metal Bear (real name Alex Bradly), Trash D Garbage (real name Paul Bailey), Flash Bastard (real name Jan Cyrka), Suzi X (real name Richard Levy), Tex Diablo (real name Christopher Renshaw), and Robbie Vom (real name Rob Morris).\n\nZodiac Mindwarp progressed rapidly from their first gig at [[Dingwalls]] in November 1985, to playing in front of a packed [[Reading Festival]] in 1986, but was followed by the departure of Kid Chaos who joined [[The Cult]]. Zodiac regrouped by assigning Trash D Garbage on Bass and Flash Bastard (Jan Cyrka) on rhythm guitar section. The expanded five member outfit all went on to record Zodiac Mindwarp and the Love Reaction's debut album in 1988 entitled ''[[Tattooed Beat Messiah]]''.<ref name=\"LarkinHM\"/> Other band members playing bass include Suzi X, Tex Diablo and Kev Reverb; whilst previous drummers were Robbie Vomm and The Apocalypse.\n\nThe act produced a [[UK Singles Chart]] Top 20 hit with the breakthrough [[Gramophone record|record]] \"Prime Mover\",<ref name=\"LarkinHM\"/> a song that was inspired musically by [[Hawkwind]]'s 1977 track \"[[Quark, Strangeness and Charm (song)|Quark, Strangeness and Charm]]\", itself heavily inspired by the German group [[NEU!]]{{citation needed|date=November 2019}}\n\nThey toured the US supporting [[Alice Cooper]] and  [[Guns N' Roses]] on dozens of dates in 1988. After a few gigs, they were moved up to the middle of the bill between Cooper and Guns N' Roses. Stargazer, Thunderhide and Bastard were also featured in the film ''[[The Decline of Western Civilization Part II: The Metal Years]]'' performing with Slash and Axl Rose (from Guns N' Roses) and Alice Cooper, in an encore from this tour featuring Cooper's hit \"Under My Wheels\". The Love Reaction's 1987 album ''Tattooed Beat Messiah'' failed to sell well enough in the States, resulting in them being dropped by their record label with outstanding debts, according to Zodiac himself.{{citation needed|date=November 2019}} The ''Tattooed Beat Messiah'' LP spawned five videos that received regular rotation on [[MTV]]'s ''[[Headbangers Ball]]''.\n\nOccasionally referred to as \"biker rock\", the band's style of hard rock is reflected in their outlandish attire, which tends to parody the post-apocalyptic [[Mad Max (franchise)|Mad Max]] biker look.

Due to Alice changing a small number of the lyrics for his version, he is listed as co-writer. Zodiac Mindwarp and The Love Reaction's own version of the song appeared on their album ''Hoodlum Thunder''.\n* In 1992, Mindwarp appeared on the album ''[[456 (album)|456]]'' by [[The Grid]], performing [[lead vocalist|lead vocals]] on the track \"Fire Engine Red\".

At the time of his joining, the show had just added [[Washington, D.C.]], as its third market in addition to [[New York City]] and [[Philadelphia]].\n\nOver time, Melendez became known for segments in which he asked celebrities confrontational questions at [[red carpet]] events, functions, promotional appearances, and press conferences. The puerile questions\u2014written by [[Howard Stern]], [[Fred Norris]], and [[Jackie Martling]]\u2014centered around a given celebrity's private life and were premised on the idea that they would not want to look bad by refusing an interview from someone who stuttered. Melendez sported long hair and [[Metal (music)|metal]] [[Concert T-shirt|T-shirts]], asking questions by reading them from a sheet of paper. As he became better known, he occasionally wore a disguise consisting of an [[overcoat]], [[fedora]], and [[fake mustache]]. His interviews were characterized by punchline-free \"joke\" questions, such as asking actress [[Melanie Griffith]] how her father, [[Andy Griffith|Andy]], was.\n\nThe absurdity of the questions Melendez asked was often amplified by the fact that he himself appeared to lack common [[popular culture|pop culture]] knowledge and often did not even seem to know who the subjects of his interview were or why they were famous. Melendez would thus frequently be unaware of why his questions would provoke such angry reactions, such as when he asked [[Ally Sheedy]] if she had vomited lately, unaware that the actress suffered from [[bulimia]]. Some celebrities were a personal target of Stern's, such as [[Ted Williams]], who was interviewed by Melendez because Stern disapproved of athletes charging money for autographs. Celebrities would often react angrily, but other times, they would take the questions in good humor.\n\nMelendez notably interviewed [[Gennifer Flowers]], [[Ringo Starr]], and the [[Tenzin Gyatso, 14th Dalai Lama|Dalai Lama]].<ref name=\"Nothing's Out of the Question\">Richard Lei, [https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/lifestyle/1994/04/28/nothings-out-of-the-question/093d3ed1-ea17-430d-8b7f-4f81ae146fc3/?noredirect=on Nothing's Out of the Question], ''Washington Post'', April 28, 1994</ref> At Gennifer Flowers' news conference playing the 'Clinton Tapes', he asked her if she planned to sleep with any other candidates before the [[1992 United States presidential election|election]], to which she reacted by laughing.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhQoXDLDIHM&feature=player_detailpage#t=150|title=Classic Stuttering John Interviews|last=larmcc|date=22 April 2008|publisher=|via=YouTube}}</ref> He asked the Dalai Lama if anyone ever greeted him with \"[[Hello, Dolly! (musical)|Hello Dalai]]!\", in a joking reference to the play and movie; the Dalai Lama's translator whispered the translation to the Dalai Lama, who chuckled. Another time Melendez interviewed [[Debbie Gibson]] about losing an award to [[Wilson Phillips]], to which she jokingly agreed with his idea that \"the [[Carnie Wilson|fat one]] would eat the statue.\" Melendez also provided comic interest with his misadventures, poor grammar, and sloppy pronunciation.<ref name=\"stuttjohn\">{{cite magazine | url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,307197,00.htm | magazine=[[Entertainment Weekly]] | title=H-H-H-HERE'S JOHNNY!

In 1994, Melendez signed a record contract with [[Atlantic Records]] and released his self-titled album with a music video broadcast on [[MTV]]'s ''[[Headbangers Ball]]''.<ref name=\"Nothing's Out of the Question\" /> That year, he was being paid $20,000 annually by the Stern show, which had 15 million listeners.<ref name=\"Nothing's Out of the Question\"/>\n\nDuring his 15-year run as Stern's employee, Melendez also starred in the [[Off-Broadway]] show ''[[Tony n' Tina's Wedding]]'' where he met his future wife, Suzanna. He appeared in such films as ''[[Airheads]]'', ''[[Meet Wally Sparks]]'', ''[[Dude, Where's My Car?]]'', and ''[[Osmosis Jones]]'', as well as Howard Stern's film ''[[Private Parts (1997 film)|Private Parts]]''. He has also appeared on television in episodes of ''[[Wings (NBC TV series)|Wings]]'', ''[[Baywatch Nights]]'', and the 2003 United States version of the [[reality television|reality]] series ''[[I'm a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here! (American TV series)|I'm a Celebrity... Get Me Out Of Here!]]''.<ref name=\"NSA\"/>\n\nMelendez was also the protagonist of some of the show's more outrageous moments. In 2001, during [[A.J. Benza]]'s appearance, Melendez got slapped in the face by Benza who did not appreciate the incessant lampooning of [[A. J. After Hours|his failed late-night show]], seeing Melendez as the main culprit. The on-air slap prompted extended fracas and resulted in Benza being permanently banned from Stern's show.\n\nThroughout the early part of 2002, Melendez and WXRK afternoon deejay [[Lee Mroszak]] (aka \"Crazy Cabbie\") had numerous on-air spats, which were used by Stern as fodder for multiple segments on the show. Their feud eventually culminated in a boxing match scheduled for Friday morning May 31, 2002, at [[Trump Taj Mahal]] in [[Atlantic City]] and was promoted on the show as \"The Flunky versus the Junkie\" with 2,500 tickets going on sale for $100 each. The 7 a.m. fight, essentially an extended segment on the show which itself was broadcast from around the ring that morning, was set for five two-minute rounds with a two-minute break in between each round. It went the distance, with the 175&nbsp;lb Melendez winning over the 262&nbsp;lb Cabbie by unanimous decision.\n\nFollowing a guest appearance on ''[[The Tonight Show with Jay Leno|The Tonight Show]]'' to promote ''[[I'm a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here! (American TV series)|I'm a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here!]]'' in 2003, Melendez received an offer from [[Jay Leno]] to become the late-night show's New York 'correspondent' who would ask celebrities questions on the red carpet, similar to one of his roles on the Stern show. Melendez claimed that he turned down the offer because he could not get a private conversation with Stern to ask him about it. Stern later claimed how \"lame\" an idea it was for Leno to reuse Melendez the way he did (in a less edgy way).\n\nIn parallel with his duties on the Stern show in the morning, Melendez got a daily afternoon show on New York City's [[WNYL (FM)|WXRK]] (''The Howard Stern Show'' [[flagship (broadcasting)|flagship]] station) from noon to 1 pm called ''Out to Lunch'', consisting mostly of taking musical requests by e-mail and playing them. The show was canceled on August 21, 2003, with Stern turning it into a 45-minute segment at the end of his live broadcast that day by having WXRK program director Robert Cross (aka Chuck Roast) come in and break the bad news on the air to Melendez.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.marksfriggin.com/news03/8-18.htm|title=MarksFriggin.com - Stern Show News - Archive|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n====Leaving the show====\nIn February 2004, the ''[[New York Post]]'' revealed that Melendez had been offered the announcer position on ''The Tonight Show'' while Stern's show was on vacation. Many perceived the move as an attempt by Leno to attract a younger demographic. Melendez's offer, which was made without Stern's knowledge, prompted a rift between Stern and Leno. Stern berated Leno on his show for weeks on end, with insults such as \"To an 18- to 25-year-old male, Jay Leno is gay. He might as well put a dress on,\" as well as accusations that Leno was \"ripping him off.\"<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,112306,00.html |publisher=Fox News |title=Stern Rails Against Leno for Lifting 'Stuttering John' |date=February 24, 2004 |access-date=2011-01-28 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121026005932/http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,112306,00.html |archive-date=2012-10-26 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nFollowing Melendez's departure, Stern organized an on-air contest to find his replacement. Billed as \"Win John's Job\" (much like \"Win Jackie's Money\" after writer Jackie Martling walked out), the contest resulted in the hiring of Sal Governale (aka \"Sal the Stockbroker\") and [[Richard Christy]]. Although for several years, L.A. radio disc-jockey \"Scary Gary\" (from 97.1 KSLX, which played Stern's radio show in Southern California) did Stuttering John style interviews that Stern would play on his show. Also, in his latter years on the Stern show, John had become too recognizable for the amount of celebrity interviews he became niche-famous for.\n\n====Comments since departure and relationship with Stern====\nOn February 27, 2008, more than four years removed from his time on ''The Howard Stern Show'',  Melendez was interviewed over the phone by [[Adam Carolla]] on his [[The Adam Carolla Show (radio)|radio show]] with discussion of Melendez's 15 years as Stern's employee dominating the conversation. Carolla brought up the fact that on-air personnel on radio shows, even long-running hit shows, earn very low salaries compared to the show's host and wondered what kind of money Melendez made considering he was down in the show's pecking order, behind Stern, [[Robin Quivers]], [[Fred Norris|Fred]], [[Jackie Martling|Jackie]], and [[Gary Dell'Abate|Gary]]. Melendez revealed that his first salary on ''The Howard Stern Show'' in 1990 was $10,000 per year before adding that, much to his disappointment, he only got an additional $10,000 per year once the show began to be broadcast on E! in 1994.<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iu8818oBhng Stuttering John on the Adam Carolla Show]; February 27, 2008</ref>\n\nAsked explicitly by Carolla if, considering that the station manager [[Tom Chiusano]] would not increase his salary, he ever thought, hoped or expected that Stern (who earned more than $20 million per year) would \"kick something down to [him],\" Melendez answered:\n\n{{Quote|text=Of course, Adam.

At the time of his joining, the show had just added [[Washington, D.C.]], as its third market in addition to [[New York City]] and [[Philadelphia]].\n\nOver time, Melendez became known for segments in which he asked celebrities confrontational questions at [[red carpet]] events, functions, promotional appearances, and press conferences. The puerile questions\u2014written by [[Howard Stern]], [[Fred Norris]], and [[Jackie Martling]]\u2014centered around a given celebrity's private life and were premised on the idea that they would not want to look bad by refusing an interview from someone who stuttered. Melendez sported long hair and [[Metal (music)|metal]] [[Concert T-shirt|T-shirts]], asking questions by reading them from a sheet of paper. As he became better known, he occasionally wore a disguise consisting of an [[overcoat]], [[fedora]], and [[fake mustache]]. His interviews were characterized by punchline-free \"joke\" questions, such as asking actress [[Melanie Griffith]] how her father, [[Andy Griffith|Andy]], was.\n\nThe absurdity of the questions Melendez asked was often amplified by the fact that he himself appeared to lack common [[popular culture|pop culture]] knowledge and often did not even seem to know who the subjects of his interview were or why they were famous. Melendez would thus frequently be unaware of why his questions would provoke such angry reactions, such as when he asked [[Ally Sheedy]] if she had vomited lately, unaware that the actress suffered from [[bulimia]]. Some celebrities were a personal target of Stern's, such as [[Ted Williams]], who was interviewed by Melendez because Stern disapproved of athletes charging money for autographs. Celebrities would often react angrily, but other times, they would take the questions in good humor.\n\nMelendez notably interviewed [[Gennifer Flowers]], [[Ringo Starr]], and the [[Tenzin Gyatso, 14th Dalai Lama|Dalai Lama]].<ref name=\"Nothing's Out of the Question\">Richard Lei, [https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/lifestyle/1994/04/28/nothings-out-of-the-question/093d3ed1-ea17-430d-8b7f-4f81ae146fc3/?noredirect=on Nothing's Out of the Question], ''Washington Post'', April 28, 1994</ref> At Gennifer Flowers' news conference playing the 'Clinton Tapes', he asked her if she planned to sleep with any other candidates before the [[1992 United States presidential election|election]], to which she reacted by laughing.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhQoXDLDIHM&feature=player_detailpage#t=150|title=Classic Stuttering John Interviews|last=larmcc|date=22 April 2008|publisher=|via=YouTube}}</ref> He asked the Dalai Lama if anyone ever greeted him with \"[[Hello, Dolly! (musical)|Hello Dalai]]!\", in a joking reference to the play and movie; the Dalai Lama's translator whispered the translation to the Dalai Lama, who chuckled. Another time Melendez interviewed [[Debbie Gibson]] about losing an award to [[Wilson Phillips]], to which she jokingly agreed with his idea that \"the [[Carnie Wilson|fat one]] would eat the statue.\" Melendez also provided comic interest with his misadventures, poor grammar, and sloppy pronunciation.<ref name=\"stuttjohn\">{{cite magazine | url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,307197,00.htm | magazine=[[Entertainment Weekly]] | title=H-H-H-HERE'S JOHNNY!

In 1994, Melendez signed a record contract with [[Atlantic Records]] and released his self-titled album with a music video broadcast on [[MTV]]'s ''[[Headbangers Ball]]''.<ref name=\"Nothing's Out of the Question\" /> That year, he was being paid $20,000 annually by the Stern show, which had 15 million listeners.<ref name=\"Nothing's Out of the Question\"/>\n\nDuring his 15-year run as Stern's employee, Melendez also starred in the [[Off-Broadway]] show ''[[Tony n' Tina's Wedding]]'' where he met his future wife, Suzanna. He appeared in such films as ''[[Airheads]]'', ''[[Meet Wally Sparks]]'', ''[[Dude, Where's My Car?]]'', and ''[[Osmosis Jones]]'', as well as Howard Stern's film ''[[Private Parts (1997 film)|Private Parts]]''. He has also appeared on television in episodes of ''[[Wings (NBC TV series)|Wings]]'', ''[[Baywatch Nights]]'', and the 2003 United States version of the [[reality television|reality]] series ''[[I'm a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here! (American TV series)|I'm a Celebrity... Get Me Out Of Here!]]''.<ref name=\"NSA\"/>\n\nMelendez was also the protagonist of some of the show's more outrageous moments. In 2001, during [[A.J. Benza]]'s appearance, Melendez got slapped in the face by Benza who did not appreciate the incessant lampooning of [[A. J. After Hours|his failed late-night show]], seeing Melendez as the main culprit. The on-air slap prompted extended fracas and resulted in Benza being permanently banned from Stern's show.\n\nThroughout the early part of 2002, Melendez and WXRK afternoon deejay [[Lee Mroszak]] (aka \"Crazy Cabbie\") had numerous on-air spats, which were used by Stern as fodder for multiple segments on the show. Their feud eventually culminated in a boxing match scheduled for Friday morning May 31, 2002, at [[Trump Taj Mahal]] in [[Atlantic City]] and was promoted on the show as \"The Flunky versus the Junkie\" with 2,500 tickets going on sale for $100 each. The 7 a.m. fight, essentially an extended segment on the show which itself was broadcast from around the ring that morning, was set for five two-minute rounds with a two-minute break in between each round. It went the distance, with the 175&nbsp;lb Melendez winning over the 262&nbsp;lb Cabbie by unanimous decision.\n\nFollowing a guest appearance on ''[[The Tonight Show with Jay Leno|The Tonight Show]]'' to promote ''[[I'm a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here! (American TV series)|I'm a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here!]]'' in 2003, Melendez received an offer from [[Jay Leno]] to become the late-night show's New York 'correspondent' who would ask celebrities questions on the red carpet, similar to one of his roles on the Stern show. Melendez claimed that he turned down the offer because he could not get a private conversation with Stern to ask him about it. Stern later claimed how \"lame\" an idea it was for Leno to reuse Melendez the way he did (in a less edgy way).\n\nIn parallel with his duties on the Stern show in the morning, Melendez got a daily afternoon show on New York City's [[WNYL (FM)|WXRK]] (''The Howard Stern Show'' [[flagship (broadcasting)|flagship]] station) from noon to 1 pm called ''Out to Lunch'', consisting mostly of taking musical requests by e-mail and playing them. The show was canceled on August 21, 2003, with Stern turning it into a 45-minute segment at the end of his live broadcast that day by having WXRK program director Robert Cross (aka Chuck Roast) come in and break the bad news on the air to Melendez.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.marksfriggin.com/news03/8-18.htm|title=MarksFriggin.com - Stern Show News - Archive|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n====Leaving the show====\nIn February 2004, the ''[[New York Post]]'' revealed that Melendez had been offered the announcer position on ''The Tonight Show'' while Stern's show was on vacation. Many perceived the move as an attempt by Leno to attract a younger demographic. Melendez's offer, which was made without Stern's knowledge, prompted a rift between Stern and Leno. Stern berated Leno on his show for weeks on end, with insults such as \"To an 18- to 25-year-old male, Jay Leno is gay. He might as well put a dress on,\" as well as accusations that Leno was \"ripping him off.\"<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,112306,00.html |publisher=Fox News |title=Stern Rails Against Leno for Lifting 'Stuttering John' |date=February 24, 2004 |access-date=2011-01-28 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121026005932/http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,112306,00.html |archive-date=2012-10-26 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nFollowing Melendez's departure, Stern organized an on-air contest to find his replacement. Billed as \"Win John's Job\" (much like \"Win Jackie's Money\" after writer Jackie Martling walked out), the contest resulted in the hiring of Sal Governale (aka \"Sal the Stockbroker\") and [[Richard Christy]]. Although for several years, L.A. radio disc-jockey \"Scary Gary\" (from 97.1 KSLX, which played Stern's radio show in Southern California) did Stuttering John style interviews that Stern would play on his show. Also, in his latter years on the Stern show, John had become too recognizable for the amount of celebrity interviews he became niche-famous for.\n\n====Comments since departure and relationship with Stern====\nOn February 27, 2008, more than four years removed from his time on ''The Howard Stern Show'',  Melendez was interviewed over the phone by [[Adam Carolla]] on his [[The Adam Carolla Show (radio)|radio show]] with discussion of Melendez's 15 years as Stern's employee dominating the conversation. Carolla brought up the fact that on-air personnel on radio shows, even long-running hit shows, earn very low salaries compared to the show's host and wondered what kind of money Melendez made considering he was down in the show's pecking order, behind Stern, [[Robin Quivers]], [[Fred Norris|Fred]], [[Jackie Martling|Jackie]], and [[Gary Dell'Abate|Gary]]. Melendez revealed that his first salary on ''The Howard Stern Show'' in 1990 was $10,000 per year before adding that, much to his disappointment, he only got an additional $10,000 per year once the show began to be broadcast on E! in 1994.<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iu8818oBhng Stuttering John on the Adam Carolla Show]; February 27, 2008</ref>\n\nAsked explicitly by Carolla if, considering that the station manager [[Tom Chiusano]] would not increase his salary, he ever thought, hoped or expected that Stern (who earned more than $20 million per year) would \"kick something down to [him],\" Melendez answered:\n\n{{Quote|text=Of course, Adam. I mean, listen, you know, I love Howard and all, but my biggest beef has always been on that show that, you know, they just don't take care of people financially... That bothered me...

Echoing an earlier rabbinic comment found in the commentary of Rashi to the Songs of Songs (4:5) Ginzberg explained\u2014there is also a great bond of union between the first five commandments and the last five. The first commandment: \"I am the Lord, thy God,\" corresponds to the sixth: \"Thou shalt not kill,\" for the murderer slays the image of God. The second: \"Thou shalt have no strange gods before me,\" corresponds to the seventh: \"Thou shalt not commit adultery,\" for conjugal faithlessness is as grave a sin as idolatry, which is faithlessness to God. The third commandment: \"Thou shalt not take the name of the Lord in vain,\" corresponds to the eighth: \"Thou shalt not steal,\" for stealing result in false oath in God's name. The fourth: \"Remember the Sabbath day, to keep it holy,\" corresponds to the ninth: \"Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbor,\" for he who bears false witness against his neighbor commits as grave a sin as if he had borne false witness against God, saying that He had not created the world in six days and rested on the seventh day (the holy Sabbath). The fifth commandment: \"Honor thy father and thy mother,\" corresponds to the tenth: \"Covet not thy neighbor's wife,\" for one who indulges this lust produces children who will not honor their true father, but will consider a stranger their father.<ref>Ginzberg, Louis, [https://philologos.org/__eb-lotj/vol3/p03.htm#THE%20UNITY%20OF%20THE%20TEN%20COMMANDMENTS ''The Legends of the Jews'', Vol. III: The Unity of Ten Commandments] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180807032722/https://philologos.org/__eb-lotj/vol3/p03.htm#THE%20UNITY%20OF%20THE%20TEN%20COMMANDMENTS |date=7 August 2018 }}, (Translated by Henrietta Szold), Johns Hopkins University Press: 1998, {{ISBN|0-8018-5890-9}}</ref>\n\nThe traditional Rabbinical Jewish belief is that the observance of these commandments and the other ''mitzvot'' are required solely of the Jewish people and that the laws incumbent on humanity in general are outlined in the seven [[Noahide laws]], several of which overlap with the Ten Commandments.

No church council had ruled on whether such practices constituted idolatry. The controversy reached crisis level in the 8th century, during the period of [[iconoclasm]]: the smashing of icons,{{fact|date=February 2020}} and again in the Middle Ages, becoming a critical point of contention in the [[Protestant Reformation]].\n\nIn 726 [[Leo III the Isaurian|Emperor Leo III]] ordered all images removed from all churches; in 730 a council forbade veneration of images, citing the Second Commandment; in 787 the [[Seventh Ecumenical Council]] reversed the preceding rulings, condemning iconoclasm and sanctioning the veneration of images; in 815 [[Leo V the Armenian|Leo V]] called yet another council, which reinstated iconoclasm; in 843 [[Theodora (wife of Theophilos)|Empress Theodora]] again reinstated veneration of icons.{{fact|date=February 2020}} This mostly settled the matter until the Reformation, when [[John Calvin]] declared that the ruling of the Seventh Ecumenical Council \"emanated from Satan\".{{fact|date=February 2020}} Protestant iconoclasts at this time destroyed statues, pictures, stained glass, and artistic masterpieces.{{fact|date=February 2020}}\n\nThe [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] celebrates Theodora's restoration of the icons every year on the First Sunday of [[Great Lent]].{{fact|date=February 2020}} Eastern Orthodox tradition teaches that while images of God, the Father, remain prohibited, depictions of Jesus as the incarnation of God as a visible human are permissible.

Goethe thus argued that the Ten Commandments revealed to Moses at [[Mt. Sinai]] would have emphasized rituals, and that the \"ethical\" Decalogue Christians recite in their own churches was composed at a later date, when Israelite prophets had begun to prophesy the coming of the [[messiah]]. Levinson points out that there is no evidence, internal to the Hebrew Bible or in external sources, to support this conjecture. He concludes that its vogue among later critical historians represents the persistence of the idea that the [[supersession]] of Judaism by Christianity is part of a longer history of progress from the ritualistic to the ethical.<ref>Levinson, Bernard M. (July 2002). \"Goethe's Analysis of Exodus 34 and Its Influence on Julius Wellhausen: the Pfropfung of the Documentary Hypothesis\".

Critics instead began to suppose that law and ritual could be of equal importance, while taking different form, at different times. This means that there is no longer any ''a priori'' reason to believe that Exodus 20:2\u201317 and Exodus 34:10\u201328 were composed during different stages of Israelite history. For example, critical historian [[John Bright (biblical scholar)|John Bright]] also dates the Jahwist texts to the tenth century BCE, but believes that they express a theology that \"had already been normalized in the period of the Judges\" (i.e., of the tribal alliance).<ref>John Bright 1972 ''A History of Israel'' Second Edition.

The Decalogue, he argues, was modelled on the suzerainty treaties of the [[Hittites]] (and other Mesopotamian Empires), that is, represents the relationship between God and Israel as a relationship between king and vassal, and enacts that bond.<ref>John Bright, 1972, p., 146\u2013147 [https://books.google.com/books?id=0VG67yLs-LAC&lpg=PA146&dq=%22A%20History%20of%20Israel%22&pg=PA146#v=onepage&q&f=false 4th ed. p.150\u2013151] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160428085746/https://books.google.com/books?id=0VG67yLs-LAC&lpg=PA146&dq=%22A%20History%20of%20Israel%22&pg=PA146#v=onepage&q&f=false |date=28 April 2016 }}</ref>\n\n\"The prologue of the Hittite treaty reminds his vassals of his benevolent acts..

It is likely to be an independent document, which was inserted here by the Redactor.\"<ref>Friedman, p. 153</ref> In his view, the [[Covenant Code]] follows that version of the Ten Commandments in the northern Israel E narrative. In the J narrative in Exodus 34 the editor of the combined story known as the Redactor (or RJE), adds in an explanation that these are a replacement for the earlier tablets which were shattered. \"In the combined JE text, it would be awkward to picture God just commanding Moses to make some tablets, as if there were no history to this matter, so RJE adds the explanation that these are a replacement for the earlier tablets that were shattered.\"<ref>Friedman, p. 177</ref>\n\nHe writes that Exodus 34:14\u201326 is the J text of the Ten Commandments: \"The first two commandments and the sabbath commandment have parallels in the other versions of the Ten Commandments.

Organizations such as the [[American Civil Liberties Union]] (ACLU) and [[Americans United for Separation of Church and State]] launched lawsuits challenging the posting of the ten commandments in public buildings. The ACLU has been supported by a number of religious groups (such as the [[Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.)]],<ref>PCUSA Assembly Committee on General Assembly Procedures D.3.a http://apps.pcusa.org/ga216/business/commbooks/comm03.pdf{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> and the [[American Jewish Congress]]<ref>American Jewish Congress, \"AJCongress Voices Opposition to Courtroom Display of ten Commandments,\" (May 16, 2003) http://www.ajcongress.org/site/PageServer?pagename=may03_03 {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140904031027/http://www.ajcongress.org/site/PageServer?pagename=may03_03 |date=4 September 2014 }}</ref>), both because they do not want government to be issuing religious doctrine and because they feel strongly that the commandments are inherently religious. Many commentators see this issue as part of a wider [[culture war]] between liberal and conservative elements in American society. In response to the perceived attacks on traditional society, other legal organizations, such as the [[Liberty Counsel]], have risen to advocate the conservative interpretation. Many Christian conservatives have taken the banning of officially sanctioned prayer from public schools by the [[U.S. Supreme Court]] as a threat to the expression of religion in public life. In response, they have successfully lobbied many state and local governments to display the ten commandments in public buildings.\n\nThose who oppose the posting of the ten commandments on public property argue that it violates the [[Establishment Clause of the First Amendment|establishment clause]] of the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment to the Constitution of the United States]]. In contrast, groups like the Fraternal Order of Eagles who support the public display of the ten commandments claim that the commandments are not necessarily religious but represent the moral and legal foundation of society, and are appropriate to be displayed as a historical source of present-day legal codes. Also, some argue like Judge [[Roy Moore]] that prohibiting the public practice of religion is a violation of the first amendment's guarantee of [[Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment|freedom of religion]].<ref name=\"moses.creighton.edu\" />\n\n[[File:1 Gebot (Lucas Cranach d A).jpg|thumb|''The Ten Commandments'' by [[Lucas Cranach the Elder]] in the townhall of [[Wittenberg]] (detail)]]\nU.S. courts have often ruled against displays of the Ten Commandments on government property. They conclude that the ten commandments are derived from [[Judeo-Christian]] religions, to the exclusion of others: the statement \"Thou shalt have no other gods before me\" excludes non-monotheistic religions like [[Hinduism]], for example. Whether the Constitution prohibits the posting of the commandments or not, there are additional political and civil rights issues regarding the posting of what is construed as religious doctrine. Excluding religions that have not accepted the ten commandments creates the [[appearance of impropriety]]. The courts have been more accepting, however, of displays that place the Ten Commandments in a broader historical context of the development of law.\n\nOne result of these legal cases has been that proponents of displaying the Ten Commandments have sometimes surrounded them with other historical texts to portray them as historical, rather than religious. Another result has been that other religious organizations have tried to put monuments to their laws on public lands. For example, an organization called [[Summum]] has won court cases against municipalities in [[Utah]] for refusing to allow the group to erect a monument of Summum [[aphorisms]] next to the ten commandments. The cases were won on the grounds that Summum's right to [[freedom of speech]] was denied and the governments had engaged in [[discrimination]]. Instead of allowing Summum to erect its monument, the local governments chose to remove their ten commandments.\n\n==Cultural references==\nTwo famous films with this name were directed by [[Cecil B.

Echoing an earlier rabbinic comment found in the commentary of Rashi to the Songs of Songs (4:5) Ginzberg explained\u2014there is also a great bond of union between the first five commandments and the last five. The first commandment: \"I am the Lord, thy God,\" corresponds to the sixth: \"Thou shalt not kill,\" for the murderer slays the image of God. The second: \"Thou shalt have no strange gods before me,\" corresponds to the seventh: \"Thou shalt not commit adultery,\" for conjugal faithlessness is as grave a sin as idolatry, which is faithlessness to God. The third commandment: \"Thou shalt not take the name of the Lord in vain,\" corresponds to the eighth: \"Thou shalt not steal,\" for stealing result in false oath in God's name. The fourth: \"Remember the Sabbath day, to keep it holy,\" corresponds to the ninth: \"Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbor,\" for he who bears false witness against his neighbor commits as grave a sin as if he had borne false witness against God, saying that He had not created the world in six days and rested on the seventh day (the holy Sabbath). The fifth commandment: \"Honor thy father and thy mother,\" corresponds to the tenth: \"Covet not thy neighbor's wife,\" for one who indulges this lust produces children who will not honor their true father, but will consider a stranger their father.<ref>Ginzberg, Louis, [https://philologos.org/__eb-lotj/vol3/p03.htm#THE%20UNITY%20OF%20THE%20TEN%20COMMANDMENTS ''The Legends of the Jews'', Vol. III: The Unity of Ten Commandments] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180807032722/https://philologos.org/__eb-lotj/vol3/p03.htm#THE%20UNITY%20OF%20THE%20TEN%20COMMANDMENTS |date=7 August 2018 }}, (Translated by Henrietta Szold), Johns Hopkins University Press: 1998, {{ISBN|0-8018-5890-9}}</ref>\n\nThe traditional Rabbinical Jewish belief is that the observance of these commandments and the other ''mitzvot'' are required solely of the Jewish people and that the laws incumbent on humanity in general are outlined in the seven [[Noahide laws]], several of which overlap with the Ten Commandments.

''\"...all which a man loves, for which he leaves everything else but that, is his god, thus the glutton and drunkard has for his idol his own flesh, the fornicator has for his idol the harlot and the greedy has for his idol silver and gold, and so the same for every other sinner.\"''<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20110826202022/http://www.latrobe.edu.au/arts/barnabas/Barncoloured.html Gospel of Barnabas chapter XXXIII] ''Latrobe Edu''</ref>  Idolatory was thus the basic sin, which manifested in various acts or thoughts, which displace the primacy of God.  However, the Gospel of Barnabas does not form part of the Christian bible.  It is known only from 16th- and 17th-century manuscripts, and frequently reflects Islamic rather than Christian understandings<ref>{{Cite book|last=Cirillo |first=Luigi |author2=Fremaux, Michel |title=\u00c9vangile de Barnab\u00e9 |year=1977 |publisher=Beauchesne}}</ref>, so it cannot be taken as authoritative on Christian views.\n\nIn Christianity's earliest centuries, some Christians had informally adorned their homes and places of worship with images of Christ and the saints, which others thought inappropriate. No church council had ruled on whether such practices constituted idolatry. The controversy reached crisis level in the 8th century, during the period of [[iconoclasm]]: the smashing of icons,{{fact|date=February 2020}} and again in the Middle Ages, becoming a critical point of contention in the [[Protestant Reformation]].\n\nIn 726 [[Leo III the Isaurian|Emperor Leo III]] ordered all images removed from all churches; in 730 a council forbade veneration of images, citing the Second Commandment; in 787 the [[Seventh Ecumenical Council]] reversed the preceding rulings, condemning iconoclasm and sanctioning the veneration of images; in 815 [[Leo V the Armenian|Leo V]] called yet another council, which reinstated iconoclasm; in 843 [[Theodora (wife of Theophilos)|Empress Theodora]] again reinstated veneration of icons.{{fact|date=February 2020}} This mostly settled the matter until the Reformation, when [[John Calvin]] declared that the ruling of the Seventh Ecumenical Council \"emanated from Satan\".{{fact|date=February 2020}} Protestant iconoclasts at this time destroyed statues, pictures, stained glass, and artistic masterpieces.{{fact|date=February 2020}}\n\nThe [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] celebrates Theodora's restoration of the icons every year on the First Sunday of [[Great Lent]].{{fact|date=February 2020}} Eastern Orthodox tradition teaches that while images of God, the Father, remain prohibited, depictions of Jesus as the incarnation of God as a visible human are permissible.

Levinson]] argued that this reconstruction assumes a Christian perspective, and dates back to [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe]]'s polemic against Judaism, which asserted that religions evolve from the more [[ritual]]istic to the more [[ethic]]al. Goethe thus argued that the Ten Commandments revealed to Moses at [[Mt. Sinai]] would have emphasized rituals, and that the \"ethical\" Decalogue Christians recite in their own churches was composed at a later date, when Israelite prophets had begun to prophesy the coming of the [[messiah]]. Levinson points out that there is no evidence, internal to the Hebrew Bible or in external sources, to support this conjecture. He concludes that its vogue among later critical historians represents the persistence of the idea that the [[supersession]] of Judaism by Christianity is part of a longer history of progress from the ritualistic to the ethical.<ref>Levinson, Bernard M.

Critics instead began to suppose that law and ritual could be of equal importance, while taking different form, at different times. This means that there is no longer any ''a priori'' reason to believe that Exodus 20:2\u201317 and Exodus 34:10\u201328 were composed during different stages of Israelite history. For example, critical historian [[John Bright (biblical scholar)|John Bright]] also dates the Jahwist texts to the tenth century BCE, but believes that they express a theology that \"had already been normalized in the period of the Judges\" (i.e., of the tribal alliance).<ref>John Bright 1972 ''A History of Israel'' Second Edition.

The United States Constitution forbids establishment of religion by law; however images of Moses holding the tablets of the Decalogue, along other religious figures including Solomon, Confucius, and Mohamed holding the Qur'an, are sculpted on the north and south friezes of the [[United States Supreme Court Building|pediment of the Supreme Court building in Washington]].<ref>Office of the Curator, {{cite web |url=https://www.supremecourt.gov/about/northandsouthwalls.pdf |title=Courtroom Friezes: North and South Walls |access-date=5 January 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190713031226/https://www.supremecourt.gov/about/northandsouthwalls.pdf |archive-date=13 July 2019 |url-status=live }} Supreme Court of the United States, 5/8/2003.</ref> Images of the Ten Commandments have long been contested symbols for the relationship of religion to national law.<ref name=\"moses.creighton.edu\">Watts, {{cite web |url=http://moses.creighton.edu/jrs/2004/2004-13.pdf |title=Ten Commandments Monuments |access-date=27 August 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150214132154/http://moses.creighton.edu/jrs/2004/2004-13.pdf |archive-date=14 February 2015 |url-status=live }} 2004</ref>\n\nIn the 1950s and 1960s the [[Fraternal Order of Eagles]] placed possibly thousands of Ten Commandments displays in courthouses and school rooms, including many stone monuments on courthouse property.<ref>Emmet V.

New York: Facts on File.</ref> Because displaying the commandments can reflect a sectarian position if they are numbered (see above), the Eagles developed an ecumenical version that omitted the numbers, as on the monument at the Texas capitol (shown here).

Organizations such as the [[American Civil Liberties Union]] (ACLU) and [[Americans United for Separation of Church and State]] launched lawsuits challenging the posting of the ten commandments in public buildings. The ACLU has been supported by a number of religious groups (such as the [[Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.)]],<ref>PCUSA Assembly Committee on General Assembly Procedures D.3.a http://apps.pcusa.org/ga216/business/commbooks/comm03.pdf{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> and the [[American Jewish Congress]]<ref>American Jewish Congress, \"AJCongress Voices Opposition to Courtroom Display of ten Commandments,\" (May 16, 2003) http://www.ajcongress.org/site/PageServer?pagename=may03_03 {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140904031027/http://www.ajcongress.org/site/PageServer?pagename=may03_03 |date=4 September 2014 }}</ref>), both because they do not want government to be issuing religious doctrine and because they feel strongly that the commandments are inherently religious. Many commentators see this issue as part of a wider [[culture war]] between liberal and conservative elements in American society. In response to the perceived attacks on traditional society, other legal organizations, such as the [[Liberty Counsel]], have risen to advocate the conservative interpretation. Many Christian conservatives have taken the banning of officially sanctioned prayer from public schools by the [[U.S. Supreme Court]] as a threat to the expression of religion in public life. In response, they have successfully lobbied many state and local governments to display the ten commandments in public buildings.\n\nThose who oppose the posting of the ten commandments on public property argue that it violates the [[Establishment Clause of the First Amendment|establishment clause]] of the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment to the Constitution of the United States]]. In contrast, groups like the Fraternal Order of Eagles who support the public display of the ten commandments claim that the commandments are not necessarily religious but represent the moral and legal foundation of society, and are appropriate to be displayed as a historical source of present-day legal codes. Also, some argue like Judge [[Roy Moore]] that prohibiting the public practice of religion is a violation of the first amendment's guarantee of [[Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment|freedom of religion]].<ref name=\"moses.creighton.edu\" />\n\n[[File:1 Gebot (Lucas Cranach d A).jpg|thumb|''The Ten Commandments'' by [[Lucas Cranach the Elder]] in the townhall of [[Wittenberg]] (detail)]]\nU.S. courts have often ruled against displays of the Ten Commandments on government property. They conclude that the ten commandments are derived from [[Judeo-Christian]] religions, to the exclusion of others: the statement \"Thou shalt have no other gods before me\" excludes non-monotheistic religions like [[Hinduism]], for example. Whether the Constitution prohibits the posting of the commandments or not, there are additional political and civil rights issues regarding the posting of what is construed as religious doctrine. Excluding religions that have not accepted the ten commandments creates the [[appearance of impropriety]]. The courts have been more accepting, however, of displays that place the Ten Commandments in a broader historical context of the development of law.\n\nOne result of these legal cases has been that proponents of displaying the Ten Commandments have sometimes surrounded them with other historical texts to portray them as historical, rather than religious. Another result has been that other religious organizations have tried to put monuments to their laws on public lands. For example, an organization called [[Summum]] has won court cases against municipalities in [[Utah]] for refusing to allow the group to erect a monument of Summum [[aphorisms]] next to the ten commandments. The cases were won on the grounds that Summum's right to [[freedom of speech]] was denied and the governments had engaged in [[discrimination]]. Instead of allowing Summum to erect its monument, the local governments chose to remove their ten commandments.\n\n==Cultural references==\nTwo famous films with this name were directed by [[Cecil B. DeMille]]: a [[The Ten Commandments (1923 film)|silent movie which was released in 1923]] and starred [[Theodore Roberts]] as Moses and a colour [[VistaVision]] [[The Ten Commandments (1956 film)|version which was released in 1956]], and starred [[Charlton Heston]] as Moses.\n\nBoth ''[[Dekalog]]'', a 1989 Polish film series directed by [[Krzysztof Kie\u015blowski]], and ''[[The Ten]]'', a 2007 American film, use the ten commandments as a structure for 10 smaller stories.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0811106/|title=The Ten|accessdate=8 April 2020|via=www.imdb.com|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200307211234/https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0811106/|archive-date=7 March 2020|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nThe receipt of the Ten Commandments by Moses was satirized in [[Mel Brooks]]'s movie ''[[History of the World Part I]]'' (1981), which shows Moses (played by Brooks, in a similar costume to [[Charlton Heston]]'s Moses in the [[The Ten Commandments (1956 film)|1956 film]]), receiving three tablets containing fifteen commandments, but before he can present them to his people, he stumbles and drops one of the tablets, shattering it. He then presents the remaining tablets, proclaiming Ten Commandments.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ah-WdAwVg9c/ |title=Fifteen Commandments |publisher=YouTube.com |date=2012-08-10 |accessdate=2018-04-05}}</ref>\n\nIn ''[[The Prince of Egypt]]'', a 1998 animated film that depicted the early life of Moses (voiced by [[Val Kilmer]]), the final shot depicts him with the Ten Commandments at Mount Sinai, accompanied by a reprise of \"[[Deliver Us (The Prince of Egypt)|Deliver Us]]\".\n\nThe story of Moses and the Ten Commandments is discussed in the Danish stageplay ''[[Biblen]]'' (2008).\n\nIn the [[The Seven Deadly Sins (manga)|Seven Deadly Sins]] manga-franchise, there is an elite force of 10 demons called Ten Commandments, whose each has a special curse from a Demon King (commandment). The effects of each Commandment loosely bases on to the real Ten Commandments from the Abrahamic Religions.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Bible}}\n* [[Alternatives to the Ten Commandments]] \u2013 Secular and humanist alternatives to the biblical lists\n* [[Code of Hammurabi]] (1772 BC)\n* [[Code of Ur-Nammu]] (2050 BC)\n* [[Divine command theory]]\n* [[Five Precepts (Taoism)]]\n* [[Five Precepts]] ([[Buddhism]])\n* [[Eight precepts]] ([[Buddhism]])\n* [[Maat]], 42 confessions, ' The negative confession ' (1500 BC) of the [[Papyrus of Ani]], which is also known as The declaration of innocence before the Gods of the tribunal from The book of going forth by day, also [[Book of the Dead]]\n* [[The Ten Commandments (2007 film)|''The Ten Commandments'' (2007 film)]]\n* ''[[K10C: Kids' Ten Commandments]]''\n* [[Ten Commandments of Computer Ethics]]\n* [[Ten Conditions of Bai'at]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n{{Further reading |date=June 2015}}\n* {{cite book|last=Aaron |first=David H |year=2006 |title=Etched in Stone: The Emergence of the Decalogue |publisher=Continuum |isbn=0-567-02791-0}}\n* {{cite book|last=Abdrushin |year=2009 |title=The Ten Commandments of God and the Lord's Prayer |publisher=Grail Foundation Press |isbn=978-1-57461-004-8}} [https://web.archive.org/web/20100523082204/http://the10com.org/index.html The Ten Commandments of God and The Lord's Prayer]\n* Peter Barenboim, [http://www.florentine-society.ru/pdf/Biblical_Roots_of_Separation_of_Powers.pdf ''Biblical Roots of Separation of Powers'', Moscow, 2005], {{ISBN|5-94381-123-0}}.\n* {{cite book|last=Boltwood |first=Emily |year=2012 |title=10 Simple Rules of the House of Gloria |publisher=Tate Publishing |isbn=978-1-62024-840-9}}\n* {{cite book |last=Freedman |first=David Noel |authorlink=David Noel Freedman |year=2000 |title=The Nine Commandments.
