It is the oldest existing marquessate in Scotland, and the second-oldest in the British Isles, only the English [[Marquess of Winchester|marquessate of Winchester]] being older. The Marquess holds the following subsidiary titles: Lord Gordon of Strathaven and Glenlivet and Earl of Aboyne (1660; Peerage of Scotland), and Baron Meldrum, of Morven in the County of Aberdeen (1815; Peerage of the United Kingdom)<ref>The current Marquess may or may not also hold the subsidiary titles: ''Earl of Huntley (1445), Earl of Enzie and Lord Gordon of Badenoch (1599)'' all in the Peerage of Scotland. He is entitled to these per their remainders, but the House of Lords denied the 9th Marquess's accession to those titles.</ref>''\n\n==Early family history==\nThe Gordon family descends from Sir Adam Gordon of [[Gordon, Scottish Borders|Huntly]], killed at the [[Battle of Humbleton Hill]] in 1402 and succeeded in his estates by his daughter [[Elizabeth Gordon, Heiress of Gordon|Elizabeth Gordon]], wife of Alexander Seton who assumed the surname of Gordon for himself and \"all his heirs male.\" He was created '''Earl of Huntly''' in the Peerage of Scotland in 1445 and succeeded by his son, the second Earl, who served as [[Lord Chancellor of Scotland]] from 1498 to 1501. His younger son the Hon. Adam Gordon married Elizabeth, ''[[suo jure]]'' Countess of Sutherland. Their grandson John Gordon succeeded his grandmother in the earldom in 1535 (see the [[Earl of Sutherland]] for further history of this branch of the family).\n\nLord Huntly's elder son, the third Earl, was a member of the Council of Regency in 1517. He was succeeded by his grandson, the fourth Earl, Lord Chancellor of Scotland from 1546 to 1562, who was killed in the latter year, and in 1563 an Act of Attainder was passed through Parliament with all his titles forfeited. His eldest surviving son, George Gordon, was condemned to death for treason in 1563 but later pardoned. He obtained a reversal of his father's attainder in 1567 and served as Lord Chancellor of Scotland.\n\nGeorge Gordon was succeeded by his son, the aforementioned sixth Earl, who was several times engaged in rebellion against the king and had his titles forfeited in 1593. He was restored to his titles in 1597. In 1599 [[James I of England|King James VI]] created him '''Lord Gordon of Badenoch''', '''Earl of Enzie''' and '''Marquess of Huntly''' in the Peerage of Scotland. He was succeeded by his elder son, the second Marquess.\n\n==17th century onward==\nIn 1632, four years before his father's death, the sixth Earl was created '''Viscount Aboyne''' in the Peerage of Scotland in his own right, with remainder that the title should be passed on to his second son the Hon. James Gordon on his death or on the death of his father, whichever came first. Lord Huntly was a supporter of [[Charles I of England|King Charles I]] during the [[English Civil War|Civil War]] and was beheaded by the Parliamentarians in 1649, with his titles forfeited. His fourth son Lord Charles Gordon was created [[Earl of Aboyne]] in 1660. On Huntly's succession to the marquessate in 1636 he was succeeded in the viscountcy of Aboyne according to the special remainder by his second son the Hon. James (see the [[Viscount Aboyne]] for further history of this title). On Lord Huntly's death in 1649 his remaining titles passed to his eldest son, the third Marquess. He was granted a remission of his father's attainder by the exiled [[Charles II of England|King Charles II]] in 1651.\n\nWhen he died two years later the titles passed to his son, the fourth Marquess. In 1661 the attainder of 1649 was revoked by Act of Parliament. In 1684 Lord Huntly was created '''Lord Badenoch, Lochaber, Strathavon, Balmore, Auchindoun, Garthie and Kincardine''', '''Viscount of Inverness''', '''Earl of Huntly and Enzie''' and '''Duke of Gordon'''. All four titles were in the Peerage of Scotland. He was succeeded by his son, the second Duke. He was a supporter of the [[James Francis Edward Stuart|Old Pretender]]. Gordon married Lady Henrietta, daughter of [[Charles Mordaunt, 3rd Earl of Peterborough|Charles Mordaunt, 3rd Earl of Peterborough and 8th Baron Mordaunt]]. Their eldest son, the third Duke, sat in the [[House of Lords]] as a [[Representative Peer|Scottish Representative Peer]] from 1747 to 1752. He was succeeded by his eldest son, the fourth Duke. Known as \"[[Alexander Gordon, 4th Duke of Gordon|Cock o' the North]]\", he was a Scottish Representative Peer from 1767 to 1784 and served as [[Lord-Lieutenant of Aberdeenshire]] and as [[Keeper of the Great Seal of Scotland]]. In 1784 he was created '''Baron Gordon of Huntley''', in the County of Gloucester, and '''Earl of Norwich''', in the County of Norfolk, in the [[Peerage of Great Britain]]. Gordon's great-grandfather, the first Duke, was the husband of Lady Elizabeth Howard, daughter of [[Henry Howard, 6th Duke of Norfolk|Lord Henry Howard]], who had been created Baron Howard of Castle Rising in 1669 and [[Earl of Norwich]] in 1672. The earldom of Norwich had become extinct on the death of the fourth Earl (also the ninth Duke of Norfolk) in 1777 and was now revived in Gordon's favour. In 1819 Gordon also inherited the [[Baron Mordaunt|barony of Mordaunt]] through his grandmother.\n\nHis son, the fifth Duke, was a general in the Army and served as Lord-Lieutenant of Aberdeenshire and as Keeper of the Great Seal of Scotland. In 1807 he was summoned to the House of Lords through a [[writ of acceleration]] in his father's junior title of Baron Gordon of Huntley. Gordon died without legitimate issue in 1836 when the dukedom and remaining titles created in 1684 as well as the titles created in 1784 became extinct. The barony of Mordaunt fell into [[abeyance]] between his sisters. Gordon's eldest sister, [[Charlotte Lennox, Duchess of Richmond|Lady Charlotte Gordon]], inherited the Gordon estates. Her son [[Charles Gordon-Lennox, 5th Duke of Richmond]], assumed the additional surname of Gordon. In 1875, the dukedom of Gordon was revived when his son [[Charles Henry Gordon-Lennox, 6th Duke of Richmond]], was made Duke of Gordon in the [[Peerage of the United Kingdom]] (see the [[Duke of Richmond]] for further history of these titles). The Duke of Gordon was succeeded in the marquessate of Huntly by his kinsman [[George Gordon, 9th Marquess of Huntly|George Gordon, 5th Earl of Aboyne]], who became the ninth Marquess (see the [[Earl of Aboyne]] for earlier history of this branch of the family). However, the House of Lords did not allow his claims to the lordship of Gordon of Badenoch and earldom of Enzie (although they had been created at the same time as the marquessate) while his claim to the ancient earldom of Huntly was also overlooked. Lord Huntly, who also held the subsidiary title of Lord Gordon of Strahaven and Glenlivet, had earlier been a Scottish Representative Peer from 1796 to 1807. In 1815 he had been created '''Baron Meldrum''', of Morven in the County of Aberdeen, in the Peerage of the United Kingdom.\n[[Image:Huntly Castle.jpg|thumb|right|400px|[[Huntly Castle]], the former seat of the Marquesses of Huntly]]\nHe was succeeded by his son, the tenth Marquess. He represented [[East Grinstead (UK Parliament constituency)|East Grinstead]] and [[Huntingdonshire (UK Parliament constituency)|Huntingdonshire]] in the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]] and served as Lord-Lieutenant of Aberdeenshire. His eldest son, the eleventh Marquess, was a [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal]] politician and served briefly under [[William Ewart Gladstone]] as [[Captain of the Honourable Corps of Gentlemen-at-Arms]] in 1881. He was succeeded by his great-nephew, the twelfth Marquess. He was the son of Lieutenant-Colonel (Granville Cecil) Douglas Gordon (1883\u20131930), son of Granville Armyn Gordon (1856\u20131907), sixth son of the tenth Marquess. {{As of|2013}} the titles are held by the twelfth Marquess' son, Granville Charles Gomer Gordon, 13th Marquess of Huntly, 9th Earl of Aboyne, 9th Lord Gordon of Strathavon and Glenlivet and 5th Baron Meldrum, who succeeded in 1987. He is Chief of [[Clan Gordon]].\n\nBefore the passing of the [[Peerage Act 1963]], which granted all Scottish peers a seat in the House of Lords, the Marquesses of Huntly sat in the House of Lords in virtue of their junior title of Baron Meldrum, which was in the Peerage of the United Kingdom.\n\n==Other family members==\nSeveral other members of the Gordon family have also gained distinction. Lord John Gordon, younger son of the first Marquess, was created [[Viscount Melgum]] in 1627. Lord Adam Gordon (died 1801), younger son of the second Duke, was a general in the Army. Lord William Gordon (1744\u20131823), second son of the third Duke, was a [[vice-admiral]] in the [[Royal Navy]]. [[Lord George Gordon]], third and youngest son of the third Duke, sat as [[Member of Parliament]] for [[Ludgershall (UK Parliament constituency)|Ludgershall]] but is best remembered as the instigator of the Gordon Riots. Charles Gordon (1798\u20131878), illegitimate son of the fifth Duke, was an admiral in the Royal Navy. Lord John Frederick Gordon (1799\u20131878), third son of the ninth Marquess, was an admiral in the Royal Navy. He married Lady Augusta Fitzclarence, daughter of [[William IV of the United Kingdom|King William IV]] by his mistress [[Dorothea Jordan|Dorothy Jordan]]. Laurence George Frank Gordon (1864\u20131943), grandson of Lieutenant-Colonel Lord Francis Arthur Gordon (1808\u20131857), sixth son of the ninth Marquess, was a [[brigadier-general]] in the Army. [[Lord Douglas Gordon]], fourth son of the tenth Marquess, was Member of Parliament for [[Huntingdon (UK Parliament constituency)|Huntingdon]].\n\nThe family seat is [[Aboyne Castle]]. The family also previously owned [[Huntly Castle]], [[Huntly]], [[Aberdeenshire]].\n\n=={{anchor|Earl of Huntly}}Earl of Huntly (1445)==\n[[File:The Marquess of Huntly's House on the Canongate.png|thumb|The Marquess of Huntly's House on the Canongate - now part of Huntly House Museum]]\n*[[Alexander Gordon, 1st Earl of Huntly]] (died 1470)\n*[[George Gordon, 2nd Earl of Huntly]] (died 1501)\n*[[Alexander Gordon, 3rd Earl of Huntly]] (died 1524)\n*[[George Gordon, 4th Earl of Huntly]] (1514\u20131562) (forfeit 1563)\n*[[George Gordon, 5th Earl of Huntly]] (died 1576) (restored 1565)\n*[[George Gordon, 1st Marquess of Huntly|George Gordon, 6th Earl of Huntly]] (1562\u20131636) (created '''Marquess of Huntly''', '''Lord Gordon of Badenoch''', and '''Earl of Enzie''' in 1599)\n\n==Marquesses of Huntly (1599)==\n*[[George Gordon, 1st Marquess of Huntly]], 6th Earl of Huntly (1562\u20131636)\n*[[George Gordon, 2nd Marquess of Huntly]], 7th Earl of Huntly (1592\u20131649)\n*[[Lewis Gordon, 3rd Marquess of Huntly]], 8th Earl of Huntly (c. 1626\u20131653)\n*[[George Gordon, 1st Duke of Gordon|George Gordon, 4th Marquess of Huntly]], 9th Earl of Huntly (1649\u20131716) (created '''Duke of Gordon''' in 1684)\n\n==Dukes of Gordon (1684)==\n*[[George Gordon, 1st Duke of Gordon|George Gordon, 1st Duke of Gordon, 4th Marquess of Huntly]], 9th Earl of Huntly (1649\u20131716)\n*[[Alexander Gordon, 2nd Duke of Gordon|Alexander Gordon, 2nd Duke of Gordon, 5th Marquess of Huntly]], 10th Earl of Huntly (died 1728)\n*[[Cosmo Gordon, 3rd Duke of Gordon|Cosmo George Gordon, 3rd Duke of Gordon, 6th Marquess of Huntly]], 11th Earl of Huntly (c. 1720\u20131752)\n*[[Alexander Gordon, 4th Duke of Gordon|Alexander Gordon, 4th Duke of Gordon, 7th Marquess of Huntly]], 12th Earl of Huntly (1743\u20131827)\n*[[George Gordon, 5th Duke of Gordon|George Duncan Gordon, 5th Duke of Gordon, 8th Marquess of Huntly]], 13th Earl of Huntly (1770\u20131836)\n\n==Marquesses of Huntly (1599; Reverted)==\n*[[George Gordon, 9th Marquess of Huntly]], 14th Earl of Huntly, 5th Earl of Aboyne, 1st Baron Meldrum (1761\u20131853) (Created '''Baron Meldrum''' in 1815)\n*[[Charles Gordon, 10th Marquess of Huntly]], 15th Earl of Huntly, 6th Earl of Aboyne, 2nd Baron Meldrum (1792\u20131863)\n*[[Charles Gordon, 11th Marquess of Huntly]], 16th Earl of Huntly, 7th Earl of Aboyne, 3rd Baron Meldrum (1847\u20131937)\n*[[Douglas Gordon, 12th Marquess of Huntly|Douglas Charles Lindsey Gordon, 12th Marquess of Huntly]], 17th Earl of Huntly, 8th Earl of Aboyne, 4th Baron Meldrum (1908\u20131987)\n*[[Granville Gordon, 13th Marquess of Huntly|Granville Charles Gomer Gordon, 13th Marquess of Huntly]], 18th Earl of Huntly, 9th Earl of Aboyne, 5th Baron Meldrum (born 1944)\n\nThe [[heir apparent]] is the present holder's eldest son [[Alastair Gordon, Earl of Aboyne]] (born 1973).<br>\nThe heir apparent's heir apparent is his son Cosmo Alistair Gordon, Lord Strathavon (b 2009).\n\n==Family tree==\n{{hidden|Gordon and Gordon-Lennox Family Tree: {{hilite|Dukes of Gordon|#CFFFFF}} and {{hilite|Marquesses of Huntly|#FCFCC1}}|{{familytree/start|style=font-size:90%}}\n{{familytree | | |KJ1  |\nKJ1=[[James I of Scotland|King James I of Scotland]]<br>(1394\u2013r.1406\u20131437)}}\n{{familytree | | | |)|-|-|-|.| | |EHun |\nborder=0|EHun=''EARL OF HUNTLY, 1445''}}\n{{familytree | | |KJ2  | | |!| | |1E   |\nKJ2=[[James II of Scotland|King James II of Scotland]]<br>(1430\u2013r.1437\u20131460)|1E=[[Alexander Gordon, 1st Earl of Huntly|Alexander Seton (Gordon),<br>'''1st Earl of Huntly''']]<br>(d. 1470)}}\n{{familytree | | | |!| | | |!| | | |!|}}\n{{familytree | | |KJ3  | |Ana  |v|2E   |\nKJ3=[[James III of Scotland|King James III of Scotland]]<br>(1451\u2013r.1460\u20131488)|Ana=[[Annabella of Scotland]]<br>(c.1433\u20131509)|2E=[[George Gordon, 2nd Earl of Huntly|George Gordon,<br>'''2nd Earl of Huntly''']]<br>(d. 1501)}}\n{{familytree | | | |!| | | | | |)|-|-|.|}}\n{{familytree | | | |!| | | | | |!| |ESut |\nborder=0|ESut=''[[Earl of Sutherland|Earls of Sutherland]]''}}\n{{familytree | | |KJ4  | | | |3E   |\nKJ4=[[James IV of Scotland|King James IV of Scotland]]<br>(1473\u2013r.1488\u20131513)|3E=[[Alexander Gordon, 3rd Earl of Huntly|Alexander Gordon,<br>'''3rd Earl of Huntly''']]<br>(d. 1524)}}\n{{familytree | |,|-|^|-|.| | | |!|}}\n{{familytree |Cm3M | |Mag  |v|JLG  |\nCm3M=Catherine Stewart <small>(''illegit.'')</small><br>(c. 1495\u20131554)<br>''m.''

His younger son the Hon. Adam Gordon married Elizabeth, ''[[suo jure]]'' Countess of Sutherland. Their grandson John Gordon succeeded his grandmother in the earldom in 1535 (see the [[Earl of Sutherland]] for further history of this branch of the family).\n\nLord Huntly's elder son, the third Earl, was a member of the Council of Regency in 1517. He was succeeded by his grandson, the fourth Earl, Lord Chancellor of Scotland from 1546 to 1562, who was killed in the latter year, and in 1563 an Act of Attainder was passed through Parliament with all his titles forfeited. His eldest surviving son, George Gordon, was condemned to death for treason in 1563 but later pardoned. He obtained a reversal of his father's attainder in 1567 and served as Lord Chancellor of Scotland.\n\nGeorge Gordon was succeeded by his son, the aforementioned sixth Earl, who was several times engaged in rebellion against the king and had his titles forfeited in 1593. He was restored to his titles in 1597. In 1599 [[James I of England|King James VI]] created him '''Lord Gordon of Badenoch''', '''Earl of Enzie''' and '''Marquess of Huntly''' in the Peerage of Scotland. He was succeeded by his elder son, the second Marquess.\n\n==17th century onward==\nIn 1632, four years before his father's death, the sixth Earl was created '''Viscount Aboyne''' in the Peerage of Scotland in his own right, with remainder that the title should be passed on to his second son the Hon. James Gordon on his death or on the death of his father, whichever came first. Lord Huntly was a supporter of [[Charles I of England|King Charles I]] during the [[English Civil War|Civil War]] and was beheaded by the Parliamentarians in 1649, with his titles forfeited. His fourth son Lord Charles Gordon was created [[Earl of Aboyne]] in 1660. On Huntly's succession to the marquessate in 1636 he was succeeded in the viscountcy of Aboyne according to the special remainder by his second son the Hon. James (see the [[Viscount Aboyne]] for further history of this title). On Lord Huntly's death in 1649 his remaining titles passed to his eldest son, the third Marquess. He was granted a remission of his father's attainder by the exiled [[Charles II of England|King Charles II]] in 1651.\n\nWhen he died two years later the titles passed to his son, the fourth Marquess. In 1661 the attainder of 1649 was revoked by Act of Parliament. In 1684 Lord Huntly was created '''Lord Badenoch, Lochaber, Strathavon, Balmore, Auchindoun, Garthie and Kincardine''', '''Viscount of Inverness''', '''Earl of Huntly and Enzie''' and '''Duke of Gordon'''. All four titles were in the Peerage of Scotland. He was succeeded by his son, the second Duke. He was a supporter of the [[James Francis Edward Stuart|Old Pretender]]. Gordon married Lady Henrietta, daughter of [[Charles Mordaunt, 3rd Earl of Peterborough|Charles Mordaunt, 3rd Earl of Peterborough and 8th Baron Mordaunt]]. Their eldest son, the third Duke, sat in the [[House of Lords]] as a [[Representative Peer|Scottish Representative Peer]] from 1747 to 1752. He was succeeded by his eldest son, the fourth Duke. Known as \"[[Alexander Gordon, 4th Duke of Gordon|Cock o' the North]]\", he was a Scottish Representative Peer from 1767 to 1784 and served as [[Lord-Lieutenant of Aberdeenshire]] and as [[Keeper of the Great Seal of Scotland]]. In 1784 he was created '''Baron Gordon of Huntley''', in the County of Gloucester, and '''Earl of Norwich''', in the County of Norfolk, in the [[Peerage of Great Britain]]. Gordon's great-grandfather, the first Duke, was the husband of Lady Elizabeth Howard, daughter of [[Henry Howard, 6th Duke of Norfolk|Lord Henry Howard]], who had been created Baron Howard of Castle Rising in 1669 and [[Earl of Norwich]] in 1672. The earldom of Norwich had become extinct on the death of the fourth Earl (also the ninth Duke of Norfolk) in 1777 and was now revived in Gordon's favour. In 1819 Gordon also inherited the [[Baron Mordaunt|barony of Mordaunt]] through his grandmother.\n\nHis son, the fifth Duke, was a general in the Army and served as Lord-Lieutenant of Aberdeenshire and as Keeper of the Great Seal of Scotland. In 1807 he was summoned to the House of Lords through a [[writ of acceleration]] in his father's junior title of Baron Gordon of Huntley. Gordon died without legitimate issue in 1836 when the dukedom and remaining titles created in 1684 as well as the titles created in 1784 became extinct. The barony of Mordaunt fell into [[abeyance]] between his sisters. Gordon's eldest sister, [[Charlotte Lennox, Duchess of Richmond|Lady Charlotte Gordon]], inherited the Gordon estates. Her son [[Charles Gordon-Lennox, 5th Duke of Richmond]], assumed the additional surname of Gordon. In 1875, the dukedom of Gordon was revived when his son [[Charles Henry Gordon-Lennox, 6th Duke of Richmond]], was made Duke of Gordon in the [[Peerage of the United Kingdom]] (see the [[Duke of Richmond]] for further history of these titles). The Duke of Gordon was succeeded in the marquessate of Huntly by his kinsman [[George Gordon, 9th Marquess of Huntly|George Gordon, 5th Earl of Aboyne]], who became the ninth Marquess (see the [[Earl of Aboyne]] for earlier history of this branch of the family). However, the House of Lords did not allow his claims to the lordship of Gordon of Badenoch and earldom of Enzie (although they had been created at the same time as the marquessate) while his claim to the ancient earldom of Huntly was also overlooked. Lord Huntly, who also held the subsidiary title of Lord Gordon of Strahaven and Glenlivet, had earlier been a Scottish Representative Peer from 1796 to 1807. In 1815 he had been created '''Baron Meldrum''', of Morven in the County of Aberdeen, in the Peerage of the United Kingdom.\n[[Image:Huntly Castle.jpg|thumb|right|400px|[[Huntly Castle]], the former seat of the Marquesses of Huntly]]\nHe was succeeded by his son, the tenth Marquess. He represented [[East Grinstead (UK Parliament constituency)|East Grinstead]] and [[Huntingdonshire (UK Parliament constituency)|Huntingdonshire]] in the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]] and served as Lord-Lieutenant of Aberdeenshire. His eldest son, the eleventh Marquess, was a [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal]] politician and served briefly under [[William Ewart Gladstone]] as [[Captain of the Honourable Corps of Gentlemen-at-Arms]] in 1881. He was succeeded by his great-nephew, the twelfth Marquess. He was the son of Lieutenant-Colonel (Granville Cecil) Douglas Gordon (1883\u20131930), son of Granville Armyn Gordon (1856\u20131907), sixth son of the tenth Marquess. {{As of|2013}} the titles are held by the twelfth Marquess' son, Granville Charles Gomer Gordon, 13th Marquess of Huntly, 9th Earl of Aboyne, 9th Lord Gordon of Strathavon and Glenlivet and 5th Baron Meldrum, who succeeded in 1987. He is Chief of [[Clan Gordon]].\n\nBefore the passing of the [[Peerage Act 1963]], which granted all Scottish peers a seat in the House of Lords, the Marquesses of Huntly sat in the House of Lords in virtue of their junior title of Baron Meldrum, which was in the Peerage of the United Kingdom.\n\n==Other family members==\nSeveral other members of the Gordon family have also gained distinction. Lord John Gordon, younger son of the first Marquess, was created [[Viscount Melgum]] in 1627. Lord Adam Gordon (died 1801), younger son of the second Duke, was a general in the Army. Lord William Gordon (1744\u20131823), second son of the third Duke, was a [[vice-admiral]] in the [[Royal Navy]]. [[Lord George Gordon]], third and youngest son of the third Duke, sat as [[Member of Parliament]] for [[Ludgershall (UK Parliament constituency)|Ludgershall]] but is best remembered as the instigator of the Gordon Riots. Charles Gordon (1798\u20131878), illegitimate son of the fifth Duke, was an admiral in the Royal Navy. Lord John Frederick Gordon (1799\u20131878), third son of the ninth Marquess, was an admiral in the Royal Navy. He married Lady Augusta Fitzclarence, daughter of [[William IV of the United Kingdom|King William IV]] by his mistress [[Dorothea Jordan|Dorothy Jordan]]. Laurence George Frank Gordon (1864\u20131943), grandson of Lieutenant-Colonel Lord Francis Arthur Gordon (1808\u20131857), sixth son of the ninth Marquess, was a [[brigadier-general]] in the Army. [[Lord Douglas Gordon]], fourth son of the tenth Marquess, was Member of Parliament for [[Huntingdon (UK Parliament constituency)|Huntingdon]].\n\nThe family seat is [[Aboyne Castle]]. The family also previously owned [[Huntly Castle]], [[Huntly]], [[Aberdeenshire]].\n\n=={{anchor|Earl of Huntly}}Earl of Huntly (1445)==\n[[File:The Marquess of Huntly's House on the Canongate.png|thumb|The Marquess of Huntly's House on the Canongate - now part of Huntly House Museum]]\n*[[Alexander Gordon, 1st Earl of Huntly]] (died 1470)\n*[[George Gordon, 2nd Earl of Huntly]] (died 1501)\n*[[Alexander Gordon, 3rd Earl of Huntly]] (died 1524)\n*[[George Gordon, 4th Earl of Huntly]] (1514\u20131562) (forfeit 1563)\n*[[George Gordon, 5th Earl of Huntly]] (died 1576) (restored 1565)\n*[[George Gordon, 1st Marquess of Huntly|George Gordon, 6th Earl of Huntly]] (1562\u20131636) (created '''Marquess of Huntly''', '''Lord Gordon of Badenoch''', and '''Earl of Enzie''' in 1599)\n\n==Marquesses of Huntly (1599)==\n*[[George Gordon, 1st Marquess of Huntly]], 6th Earl of Huntly (1562\u20131636)\n*[[George Gordon, 2nd Marquess of Huntly]], 7th Earl of Huntly (1592\u20131649)\n*[[Lewis Gordon, 3rd Marquess of Huntly]], 8th Earl of Huntly (c. 1626\u20131653)\n*[[George Gordon, 1st Duke of Gordon|George Gordon, 4th Marquess of Huntly]], 9th Earl of Huntly (1649\u20131716) (created '''Duke of Gordon''' in 1684)\n\n==Dukes of Gordon (1684)==\n*[[George Gordon, 1st Duke of Gordon|George Gordon, 1st Duke of Gordon, 4th Marquess of Huntly]], 9th Earl of Huntly (1649\u20131716)\n*[[Alexander Gordon, 2nd Duke of Gordon|Alexander Gordon, 2nd Duke of Gordon, 5th Marquess of Huntly]], 10th Earl of Huntly (died 1728)\n*[[Cosmo Gordon, 3rd Duke of Gordon|Cosmo George Gordon, 3rd Duke of Gordon, 6th Marquess of Huntly]], 11th Earl of Huntly (c. 1720\u20131752)\n*[[Alexander Gordon, 4th Duke of Gordon|Alexander Gordon, 4th Duke of Gordon, 7th Marquess of Huntly]], 12th Earl of Huntly (1743\u20131827)\n*[[George Gordon, 5th Duke of Gordon|George Duncan Gordon, 5th Duke of Gordon, 8th Marquess of Huntly]], 13th Earl of Huntly (1770\u20131836)\n\n==Marquesses of Huntly (1599; Reverted)==\n*[[George Gordon, 9th Marquess of Huntly]], 14th Earl of Huntly, 5th Earl of Aboyne, 1st Baron Meldrum (1761\u20131853) (Created '''Baron Meldrum''' in 1815)\n*[[Charles Gordon, 10th Marquess of Huntly]], 15th Earl of Huntly, 6th Earl of Aboyne, 2nd Baron Meldrum (1792\u20131863)\n*[[Charles Gordon, 11th Marquess of Huntly]], 16th Earl of Huntly, 7th Earl of Aboyne, 3rd Baron Meldrum (1847\u20131937)\n*[[Douglas Gordon, 12th Marquess of Huntly|Douglas Charles Lindsey Gordon, 12th Marquess of Huntly]], 17th Earl of Huntly, 8th Earl of Aboyne, 4th Baron Meldrum (1908\u20131987)\n*[[Granville Gordon, 13th Marquess of Huntly|Granville Charles Gomer Gordon, 13th Marquess of Huntly]], 18th Earl of Huntly, 9th Earl of Aboyne, 5th Baron Meldrum (born 1944)\n\nThe [[heir apparent]] is the present holder's eldest son [[Alastair Gordon, Earl of Aboyne]] (born 1973).<br>\nThe heir apparent's heir apparent is his son Cosmo Alistair Gordon, Lord Strathavon (b 2009).\n\n==Family tree==\n{{hidden|Gordon and Gordon-Lennox Family Tree: {{hilite|Dukes of Gordon|#CFFFFF}} and {{hilite|Marquesses of Huntly|#FCFCC1}}|{{familytree/start|style=font-size:90%}}\n{{familytree | | |KJ1  |\nKJ1=[[James I of Scotland|King James I of Scotland]]<br>(1394\u2013r.1406\u20131437)}}\n{{familytree | | | |)|-|-|-|.| | |EHun |\nborder=0|EHun=''EARL OF HUNTLY, 1445''}}\n{{familytree | | |KJ2  | | |!| | |1E   |\nKJ2=[[James II of Scotland|King James II of Scotland]]<br>(1430\u2013r.1437\u20131460)|1E=[[Alexander Gordon, 1st Earl of Huntly|Alexander Seton (Gordon),<br>'''1st Earl of Huntly''']]<br>(d. 1470)}}\n{{familytree | | | |!| | | |!| | | |!|}}\n{{familytree | | |KJ3  | |Ana  |v|2E   |\nKJ3=[[James III of Scotland|King James III of Scotland]]<br>(1451\u2013r.1460\u20131488)|Ana=[[Annabella of Scotland]]<br>(c.1433\u20131509)|2E=[[George Gordon, 2nd Earl of Huntly|George Gordon,<br>'''2nd Earl of Huntly''']]<br>(d. 1501)}}\n{{familytree | | | |!| | | | | |)|-|-|.|}}\n{{familytree | | | |!| | | | | |!| |ESut |\nborder=0|ESut=''[[Earl of Sutherland|Earls of Sutherland]]''}}\n{{familytree | | |KJ4  | | | |3E   |\nKJ4=[[James IV of Scotland|King James IV of Scotland]]<br>(1473\u2013r.1488\u20131513)|3E=[[Alexander Gordon, 3rd Earl of Huntly|Alexander Gordon,<br>'''3rd Earl of Huntly''']]<br>(d. 1524)}}\n{{familytree | |,|-|^|-|.| | | |!|}}\n{{familytree |Cm3M | |Mag  |v|JLG  |\nCm3M=Catherine Stewart <small>(''illegit.'')</small><br>(c. 1495\u20131554)<br>''m.''

To finish off the year, on 20 December, they announced ''Sadboi Tour,'' which would be set across Europe, with Charlie hinting it'd be a \"world tour.\"\n\n=== 2020 - ''Sadboi'' ===\n\nOn 29 January, Bars and Melody took it to Instagram to announce the track list for their upcoming album ''Sadboi''. The album would consist of 12 tracks which also included previous singles \"Love to See Me Fail, \"Waiting For The Sun\", \"Lighthouse\" and \"Teenage Romance\". It was originally set for release on 6 March, however, it had to be delayed due to problems with the album shipment. On 6 March, their new single \"Ain\u2019t Got You\" was released. On 13 March they also made a surprise drop with their new song \u2018invisible\u2019. On 27 March 2020, their album was finally released. In late March, they had to postpone their Sadboi tour due to the [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic|COVID-19 outbreak.]] Some concerts were cancelled and others were postponed.\n\n==Members==\n===Leondre Devries (Bars)===\nLeondre Antonio Devries was born on 6 October  2000<ref name=\"Billboard\" /> to stonemason Antonio and personal trainer Victoria Lee.<ref name=\"WO open up\" /><ref name=\"SWEP video\">{{cite video|author=G Roberts|url=http://www.southwales-eveningpost.co.uk/Britain-s-Got-Talent-2014-Leondre-Devries-Bars/story-21199672-detail/story.html |title=Britain's Got Talent 2014: Leondre Devries from Bars and Melody tells all |publisher=South Wales Evening Post |date=7 June 2014|accessdate=25 February 2017|time=0:34}}</ref> From [[Port Talbot]], [[Neath Port Talbot]], Wales, he has three older brothers\u2014Jacob Lee, Joseph Devries (Joey), the eldest is Ben Lee \u2014and a younger sister, Matilda Devries (Tilly).<ref name=\"WO open up\" /> Joey was part of the boy band [[Overload Generation]] who participated in the [[The X Factor (UK series 11)|eleventh series]] of ''The X Factor''.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.walesonline.co.uk/whats-on/whats-on-news/x-factor-overload-generation-second-7920625?pageNumber=17 |title=X Factor: Overload Generation is second Welsh act to make it through to live stages of talent show | author=Sandra Loy |date=11 October 2014 |website=Wales Online |accessdate=25 February 2017}}</ref> Leondre Devries has spoken openly about his experiences of bullying for four years before he switched schools.<ref name=\"WO open up\" /> He attended the Glan Afan Comprehensive School at the time of the ''Britain's Got Talent'' competition.<ref name=\"SWEP Leondre\">{{cite news|author=G Roberts|url=http://www.southwales-eveningpost.co.uk/Britain-s-Got-Talent-2014-Leondre-Devries-Bars/story-21199672-detail/story.html |title=Britain's Got Talent 2014: Leondre from Bars and Melody tells all |newspaper=South Wales Evening Post |date=7 June 2014|accessdate=15 June 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714193439/http://www.southwales-eveningpost.co.uk/Britain-s-Got-Talent-2014-Leondre-Devries-Bars/story-21199672-detail/story.html|archivedate=14 July 2014}}</ref> Previously he rapped solo under the stage name 'Little Dre'.<ref name=\"WO open up\">{{cite news|url=http://www.walesonline.co.uk/whats-on/whats-on-news/britains-talent-2014-bars-melody-7184915 |title=Britain's Got Talent 2014: Bars and Melody open up on their meteoric rise to fame|date=29 May 2014|work=Wales Online|accessdate=15 June 2014}}</ref> His father said that Leondre lived with him until he appeared on ''Britain's Got Talent'', and after that has lived with his mother.<ref name=\"YN\">{{cite news|url=https://www.yahoo.com/news/britains-got-talent-stars-bars-and-melody-being-115755985.html |title=Britain\u2019s Got Talent Stars Bars And Melody Being Sued By Member\u2019s Own DAD | author=Adele Ankers |date=25 March 2016 |website=Yahoo News |accessdate=25 February 2017}}</ref> Although Leondre said that his father was a stonemason during the contest,<ref name=\"SWEP video\" /> his father now says he is a music promoter.<ref name=\"YN\" />\n\n===Charlie Lenehan (Melody)===\nCharlie Lenehan was born 27 October 1998 in [[Frampton Cotterell]].<ref name=\"Billboard\" /> He lives in [[Cologne, Germany]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/barsandmelody/status/1083478258119860224?lang=en-gb |title=Twitter |publisher=Mobile.twitter.com |date=2019-01-10 |accessdate=2019-06-03}}</ref> He has a family that consists of his mother, a school cook; his step-father, a businessman;<ref>{{cite video|author=G Roberts|url=http://www.southwales-eveningpost.co.uk/Britain-s-Got-Talent-2014-Leondre-Devries-Bars/story-21199672-detail/story.html |title=Britain's Got Talent 2014: Leondre Devries from Bars and Melody tells all |publisher=South Wales Evening Post |date=7 June 2014|accessdate=25 February 2017|time=0:42}}</ref> he has a younger sister, Brooke.

Factory Riders on the Tiger 200 included Mickey Dunlap, Ricky Martin, and Rick Calendine, the last whom would take the checkered flag at the '''Libertyville National Ice Race''' and the '''Lake George Grand National Ice Championship'''. \n  \n{{Infobox Motorcycle\n|name             = Tiger 200LC\n|manufacturer     = Tiger ATV LTD\n|parent_company   = \n|production       = 1984 - 1986\n|assembly         =\n|predecessor      = \n|successor        = \n|class            = [[Sport ATC]]\n|engine           = [[Rotax]] {{Convert|199|cc|abbr=on}} [[Radiator (engine cooling)|liquid-cooled]] [[two-stroke]] [[Single-cylinder engine|single]]\n|bore_stroke      = 64.5 x 61mm\n|compression      = 15.0:1\n|top_speed        = <60mph\n|power            = 34hp@8800 rpm\n|torque           = 20 lb-ft@7000\n|ignition         = Bosch CDI \n|transmission     = Manual wet-clutch<br>5-speed (6th Optional)<br>Chain Final Drive\n|frame            = 4130 Chrome Moly  \n|suspension       = Front: 36mm Forks w/8.5\u201d Travel<br>Rear: Single Monoshock w/8.5\" Travel\n|brakes           = Front: Hydraulic Disc<br>Rear: Hydraulic Disc\n|tires            = Front: 22 x 11 x 10<br>Rear: 18 x 9.50 x 8\n|wheelbase        = 50 in.\n|length           =  \n|width            =\n|height           = \n|seat_height      =  \n|dry_weight       = 255lbs\n| wet_weight       = \n| fuel_capacity    = 2.7 gal\n| oil_capacity     = \n| fuel_consumption = \n| turning_radius   = \n| range            = \n| related          = $2695 MSRP\n| sp               =\n| footnotes        = Information provided via Tiger Ad in ATV News March 1985\n}}\n\n==Tiger 500 ATC==\n\n{{Infobox Motorcycle\n|name             = Tiger 500\n|manufacturer     = Tiger ATV LTD\n|parent_company   = \n|production       = 1985\n|assembly         =\n|predecessor      = \n|successor        = \n|class            = [[Sport ATC]]\n|engine           = Rotax {{Convert|482|cc|abbr=on}} [[Radiator (engine cooling)|liquid-cooled]] [[two-stroke]] [[Single-cylinder engine|single]]\n|bore_stroke      = 85 x 85mm \n|compression      = 12.0:1\n|top_speed        = < 85 Mph \n|power            = +42hp@6500rpm\n|torque           = \n|ignition         = CDI \n|transmission     = Manual wet-clutch<br>5-speed<br>16/36 Sprockets\n|frame            = 4130 Chrome Moly  \n|suspension       = Front: 40mm Marzocchi Forks w/8.5\u201d Travel<br>Rear: Fox Twin-Clicker w/8.5\u201d Travel\n|brakes           = F/R: Grimeca Hydraulic Disc Brakes\n|tires            = Front: 23.5 x 8 x 11<br>Rear: 8\u201d R/A Race slicks<br>Optional; 10\u201d Trail Pro Knobbies\n|wheelbase        = 52 in. \n|length           =  \n|width            =\n|height           = \n|seat_height      =  \n|dry_weight       = 280 lbs.\n| wet_weight       = \n| fuel_capacity    = 2.2gal\n| oil_capacity     = \n| fuel_consumption = \n| turning_radius   = \n| range            = \n| related          = $2950 MSRP\n| sp               =\n| footnotes        = Information provided via 3wheeler Magazine; July 1985\n}}\n\nThe '''Tiger 500''' was an Air Cooled 482cc sport ATC, utilizing a Rotax Type 486 engine. The machine featured many high-end accouterments, including a 40mm Bing carb and  Bills Pipes exhaust expansion chamber. The chassis is similar to the liquid cooled models, but the engine cradle is 1 1/2\u201d longer to accommodate the larger powerplant. As these ATC's were expected to be used for competition, the trikes did not ship with a Spark Arrestor or skid plates. Lights, Air Box, and secondary gas tank were options.<ref>{{cite web| |url= http://www.3wheelerworld.com/oldsite/tiger500.shtml |title=Tiger 500 ATC |website=3wheelerworld.com||accessdate=2020-04-15 |url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nIn a 1985 review in '''3 wheelers Magazine''', the test rider praised the smooth power band and comfortable footpeg/seating ergonomics, but criticized the rear positioned kick starter.\n\n==Tiger Super 4 Quads==\n\nOne of the final machines produced by Tiger, the Super 4, like all Tiger ATC's, featured a Chromoly frame, and in-house built body work.

After settling in its new location, the name Gandara was given to it in commemoration of the former [[Governor-General of the Philippines|Governor General]] [[Jos\u00e9 de la G\u00e1ndara y Navarro]].\n\n==History==\n\nDuring the 9th century, after the Mesopotamian exploration the Hindus explored the Cambaye Island, they bring [https://web.archive.org/web/20120804005759/http://www.anagrasarkalyan.gov.in/htm/gallery_wadi.html Sabai Grass] seedlings, Negritos and the Hindus help together to grow the Grass, when the grass are ripe enough they harvest it and sundried it, Sabai fibres were extracted from Sabai Grasses, they weave the dried grass and turn it into dresses by using a [[catgut]] as a weaver.\n\nOn the 13th century an Arabian-British explorer built and structured this sea farer guide from an Scree with the help of a Negrito inhabitants located nearby with China White as an ingredient as building material, it is lit with a Western Incandescent lamp and powered by a [[Baghdad Battery|Baghdad Carbon Cell]], the said battery is charged by sun at day.\n \nGand\u00e6ra's colonial past is evident from the solitary watchtower, the Friars returned after the remaining crew of Magellan came back from Spain, and situated along the Village called Dapdap and their Shrine called Tinago in 1596, and created a Cabecera called Catbalogan, and the Bangahon Church, the [[relic]]s of the church and fragmented artworks. Statues of saints are of numbers one of which is the St. Ni\u00f1o (An infant Child) a ''White'' statue carved from wood and being tell that it is a pair of the ''Black'' statue of the St. Ni\u00f1o of Cebu the Magellan remnants they called the Black and White saints. The White statue is being told that a clan \"Correche\" is now being held it privately. Townspeople quarried the stones from [[Napalisan]] cliff or scree carried to Dapdap and then formed and constructed the [[Tinago Shrine]] and the church from what they called ''Galut'' a clay or  ''[[Feldspar]], [[Kaolinite]]'' used to make a pot or in a pottery business in Bangahon for the church of Bangahon. These are remnants from the old Gand\u00e6ra, named Bangahon due to its geographical location in the forked of the Gandara River. \"''Ginbabanga han wala ug tuo nga salog''\". The book ''Conquistas de las Islas Filipinas'' by Gaspar de San Agustin the Bangahon states it was already a [[Pueblo]] or town in 1729, and was made a parish by the Spanish [[Jesuits]] [[Missionaries]] with [[St. Michael the Archangel]] as [[patron saint]].\n\nThe Eighteenth Century ended with Bangahon at the height of abundance and prosperity being a trading center complemented with its fertile soil producing plentiful and ample harvest every year. Potable water were carried from a balangay with a Natural Spring of Mineral Water now called San Agustin.  However, when the American battleships landed at Calbayog on February 9, 1902, the municipal officials of Bangahon prepared an occasion for the American soldiers. The American Scout then told the officials of this Marlboro that they will be donating a Bell and will constructed a school called Harvard Institute. The problem of where to build this landmark to become a new town was solved during a conference of July 25, 1903, at barrio San Pelayo but [[Dumalo-ong]] was unanimously chosen due to its ideal location being at the center and midway of the left river, right river and downstreams barrios. The bell or (Lingganay) a misfortune were carried by a barge and accidentally sunked{{typo help inline|reason=similar to sundek|date=November 2019}} and collide to it near an adobe rock formation before Bangahon going upstream along with the Bell. This bell was sequestered by the Americans on September 29, 1901 at [[Balangiga bells|Balangiga]]. Furthermore, the chosen site was located almost halfway between Calbayog City and Catbalogan City an ambient place for a Harvard Institute. Gand\u00e6ra's foundation anniversary is February the 29th.\n\nEstablished in February 29, 1904 and named after the surname of [[Governor-General of the Philippines|Spanish Governor General]] [[Jos\u00e9 de la G\u00e1ndara y Navarro]] as a respect by the American Soldier, the first captain was Jose Dionesio Mendiola, who died during the year's [[cholera]] epidemic and replaced by Jose Pichon on June 15, 1902, the contact of the American Scout not knowing were will be the bell will come from, nodding as his used attitude, served until June 15, 1903. Succeeded by Ramon Mendiola (1903\u20131906) who was remembered for celebrating the first Gand\u00e6ra town fiesta on September 28\u201329, 1904.

They produce and consume by exchanging products to and from farm or towncenter, until a townfolk ''kadiong'' convinced them to put up a cooperative or a cooperation of Gandare\u00f1os\u2019 products to put up a bunk or a stockade and that cooperative will issue a bunknote to ease the trading of products or goods. Fellows can lend seeds or fishlings from the stockade, lenders now start with their own products and can be trade with the bunk/stockade or cooperative bunknotes. Bunknotes became rampant on the town and they decided to issue a paper and metal money as a bunknote. Products from different villages stocked at the bunk, and every village has a unique bunknote to signify their origins, aside from Bangahon were a calamity had happened they only had a few stocks but in their village that stock equivalent of a bunknote has a higher value, the village with the highest stocks is the reference stocks, their number of products divided by the reference stocks is the particular village bunknote equivalent in trading. Excess stocks in the bunk are used for the development of the town.\n\nThe cooperative is until now in service but has a different name, a bank and being run by lists of corporate stores within the town.\n\nThe Internal Revenue Allotment from the National Government Budget Management Office for Gandara was PHP 28,202,218 as of 2006.\n\n==Administrative Boundaries==\n\n===Aquatic Boundaries===\n*East 11.9935 North 124.6694 merge point of Santa Margarita, Calbayog, Tarangnan and Gandara, 10,241 meters West-Northwest of Napalisan (E 11.9895 / N 124.7305)\n*East 12.0049 / North 124.7597 between Santa Margarita and Gandera a river called Lambique-Hinagbungan River 5,521 meters Northeast of Napalisan, this river serves as a boundary between two municipalities, down to East 11.99120 / North 124.75106 of the said river 1,315 meters North of Tambongan.\n*East 11.9397 / North 124.7116 merge point of Tarangnan, Pagsanghan and Gandara, 8,909 meters South-Southwest of Napalisan (E11.9895/S\\N124.7305)\n*East 11.9723 / North 124.7532 between Pagsanghan and Gandara between an islet and an island called Cambaye and Caprangasan respectively 4,763 meters Southeast of Napalisan a river called Pagsanghan-Gandara River then to East 11.9601 / North 124.7136 midpoint of a river 881 meters East-Southeast of Lungib and 319 meters Northeast of Bangon Island a river boundary then to East 11.9710 / North 124.7265, 50 meters north of Palanas midpoint of Pagsanghan-Gandara River to the right where left is back to Caprangasan.

After settling in its new location, the name Gandara was given to it in commemoration of the former [[Governor-General of the Philippines|Governor General]] [[Jos\u00e9 de la G\u00e1ndara y Navarro]].\n\n==History==\n\nDuring the 9th century, after the Mesopotamian exploration the Hindus explored the Cambaye Island, they bring [https://web.archive.org/web/20120804005759/http://www.anagrasarkalyan.gov.in/htm/gallery_wadi.html Sabai Grass] seedlings, Negritos and the Hindus help together to grow the Grass, when the grass are ripe enough they harvest it and sundried it, Sabai fibres were extracted from Sabai Grasses, they weave the dried grass and turn it into dresses by using a [[catgut]] as a weaver.\n\nOn the 13th century an Arabian-British explorer built and structured this sea farer guide from an Scree with the help of a Negrito inhabitants located nearby with China White as an ingredient as building material, it is lit with a Western Incandescent lamp and powered by a [[Baghdad Battery|Baghdad Carbon Cell]], the said battery is charged by sun at day.\n \nGand\u00e6ra's colonial past is evident from the solitary watchtower, the Friars returned after the remaining crew of Magellan came back from Spain, and situated along the Village called Dapdap and their Shrine called Tinago in 1596, and created a Cabecera called Catbalogan, and the Bangahon Church, the [[relic]]s of the church and fragmented artworks. Statues of saints are of numbers one of which is the St. Ni\u00f1o (An infant Child) a ''White'' statue carved from wood and being tell that it is a pair of the ''Black'' statue of the St. Ni\u00f1o of Cebu the Magellan remnants they called the Black and White saints. The White statue is being told that a clan \"Correche\" is now being held it privately. Townspeople quarried the stones from [[Napalisan]] cliff or scree carried to Dapdap and then formed and constructed the [[Tinago Shrine]] and the church from what they called ''Galut'' a clay or  ''[[Feldspar]], [[Kaolinite]]'' used to make a pot or in a pottery business in Bangahon for the church of Bangahon. These are remnants from the old Gand\u00e6ra, named Bangahon due to its geographical location in the forked of the Gandara River. \"''Ginbabanga han wala ug tuo nga salog''\". The book ''Conquistas de las Islas Filipinas'' by Gaspar de San Agustin the Bangahon states it was already a [[Pueblo]] or town in 1729, and was made a parish by the Spanish [[Jesuits]] [[Missionaries]] with [[St. Michael the Archangel]] as [[patron saint]].\n\nThe Eighteenth Century ended with Bangahon at the height of abundance and prosperity being a trading center complemented with its fertile soil producing plentiful and ample harvest every year. Potable water were carried from a balangay with a Natural Spring of Mineral Water now called San Agustin.  However, when the American battleships landed at Calbayog on February 9, 1902, the municipal officials of Bangahon prepared an occasion for the American soldiers. The American Scout then told the officials of this Marlboro that they will be donating a Bell and will constructed a school called Harvard Institute. The problem of where to build this landmark to become a new town was solved during a conference of July 25, 1903, at barrio San Pelayo but [[Dumalo-ong]] was unanimously chosen due to its ideal location being at the center and midway of the left river, right river and downstreams barrios. The bell or (Lingganay) a misfortune were carried by a barge and accidentally sunked{{typo help inline|reason=similar to sundek|date=November 2019}} and collide to it near an adobe rock formation before Bangahon going upstream along with the Bell. This bell was sequestered by the Americans on September 29, 1901 at [[Balangiga bells|Balangiga]]. Furthermore, the chosen site was located almost halfway between Calbayog City and Catbalogan City an ambient place for a Harvard Institute. Gand\u00e6ra's foundation anniversary is February the 29th.\n\nEstablished in February 29, 1904 and named after the surname of [[Governor-General of the Philippines|Spanish Governor General]] [[Jos\u00e9 de la G\u00e1ndara y Navarro]] as a respect by the American Soldier, the first captain was Jose Dionesio Mendiola, who died during the year's [[cholera]] epidemic and replaced by Jose Pichon on June 15, 1902, the contact of the American Scout not knowing were will be the bell will come from, nodding as his used attitude, served until June 15, 1903. Succeeded by Ramon Mendiola (1903\u20131906) who was remembered for celebrating the first Gand\u00e6ra town fiesta on September 28\u201329, 1904. From the year 1907, town executives were called Presidents. And the Reyes Clan as Royalty.\n\nThe town's new [[poblacion]] was built on some six hectares of farmland donated by Martino M. Reyes. The donation was executed on January 12, 1909. The school site covered by certificate of title no. 95 dated July 20, 1912, and that of the parish under lot no. 146-CAD-444-D dated August 31, 1914, further supported by an extra judicial donation dated March 20, 1915.\n\nArticle 960 dated October 23, 1923, transferred the jurisdiction of bara\u014bgays Bangon, Buenas Aires, Calanyugan, Cambaye, San Luis, Pangi and Pagsanghan to the Municipality of [[Tarangnan, Samar|Tarangnan]].\n\nDuring World War II, there are two Mayors in this municipality, Filadelfo Diaz Aliman for the Japanese Government and Teodoro Bisnar for the Philippine Government the [[Pulahanes]] (Pulajanes). During the war, the second waorld war, Japanese occupied this town and make the Gavaldon Building their headquarter, all Chinese traders, locals and their offspring were called and enslave them, making them a peasants. Japanese tell one Filadelfo Aliman that this maltreatment is a retaliation on their long aged war the [[First Sino-Japanese War]] and the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]], they Chinese (sino) to fight back processed a seasoning called \"Vetsin\" (a powder from a snailshell or \u201c''tipaka han wawang nga ginpino\u201d''  in Waray that causes the illness called [http://www.globalnetwork.org/schistosomiasis schistosomiasis] and told the Filipino public that it is from the Japanese armies even its name is a Japanese word. The Japanese leave and promise and then will constructure a steel bridge value that makes them stand and be courageous because of the Filipino hospitality.\n\nIn December 6, 1987, San Jorge were created as a new municipality respectively out of Gandara. 42 barangays were dissolved by the town of San Jorge including the Gandare\u00f1os owner of Atigbang Senibaran (Villaleona) to the new town administration.\n\n==Barangays==\n\n[[File:Barangays of Gandara.png|thumb|280px|Barangays of Gandara]]\nGandara is politically subdivided into 69 [[barangay]]s, listed here with its Philippine Standard Geographic Code.\n{{columns-list|colwidth=22em|\n* Adela Heights ([[Poblacion]])\n* Arong\n* Balocawe\n* Bangahon\n* Beslig\n* Buao\n* Bunyagan\n* Burabod I ([[Poblacion]])\n* Burabod II ([[Poblacion]])\n* Calirocan\n* Canhumawid\n* Caparangasan\n* Caranas\n* Carmona\n* Casab-ahan\n* Casandig\n* Catorse De Agosto\n* Caugbusan\n* Concepcion\n* Diaz\n* Dumalo-ong ([[Poblacion]])\n* Elcano\n* Gerali\n* Gereganan\n* Giaboc\n* Hampton\n* Hetebac\n* Himamaloto\n* Hinayagan\n* Hinugacan\n* Hiparayan (Kinonongan)\n* Jasminez\n* Lungib\n* Mabuhay\n* Macugo\n* Malayog\n* Marcos\n* Minda ([[Poblacion]])\n* Nacube\n* Nalihugan\n* Napalisan\n* Natimonan\n* Ngoso\n* Palambrag\n* Palanas\n* Pi\u00f1aplata\n* Pizarro\n* Pologon\n* Purog\n* Rawis\n* Rizal\n* Samoyao\n* San Agustin\n* San Antonio\n* San Enrique\n* San Francisco\n* San Isidro (Dao)\n* San Jose\n* San Miguel\n* San Pelayo\n* San Ramon\n* Santa Elena\n* Santo Ni\u00f1o\n* Senibaran (Villa Leona)\n* Sidmon\n* Tagnao\n* Tambongan\n* Tawiran\n* Tigbawon\n\n==Climate==\n{{Weather box\n| location     = Gandara, Samar\n| width        = auto\n| metric first = Yes\n| single line  = Yes\n| Jan high C = 28\n| Jan low C  = 21\n| Feb high C = 29\n| Feb low C  = 21\n| Mar high C = 29\n| Mar low C  = 21\n| Apr high C = 31\n| Apr low C  = 22\n| May high C = 31\n| May low C  = 24\n| Jun high C = 30\n| Jun low C  = 24\n| Jul high C = 29\n| Jul low C  = 24\n| Aug high C = 29\n| Aug low C  = 25\n| Sep high C = 29\n| Sep low C  = 24\n| Oct high C = 29\n| Oct low C  = 24\n| Nov high C = 29\n| Nov low C  = 23\n| Dec high C = 28\n| Dec low C  = 22\n| Jan precipitation mm = 72\n| Feb precipitation mm = 52\n| Mar precipitation mm = 65\n| Apr precipitation mm = 62\n| May precipitation mm = 87\n| Jun precipitation mm = 129\n| Jul precipitation mm = 153\n| Aug precipitation mm = 124\n| Sep precipitation mm = 147\n| Oct precipitation mm = 157\n| Nov precipitation mm = 139\n| Dec precipitation mm = 117\n| Jan rain days        = 17.4\n| Feb rain days        = 13.4\n| Mar rain days        = 16.8\n| Apr rain days        = 18.0\n| May rain days        = 22.0\n| Jun rain days        = 25.3\n| Jul rain days        = 26.2\n| Aug rain days        = 24.2\n| Sep rain days        = 24.9\n| Oct rain days        = 26.0\n| Nov rain days        = 23.3\n| Dec rain days        = 20.8\n| source 1 = Meteoblue <ref name=\"met_norms\">\n{{cite web \n| url = https://www.meteoblue.com/en/weather/historyclimate/climatemodelled/gandara_philippines_1713262\n| title =  Gandara: Average Temperatures and Rainfall\n| publisher = Meteoblue\n| accessdate = 29 February 2020 }}</ref>\n| date = 29 February 2020 \n}}\n\n==Demographics==\n{{Philippine Census \n| align= none\n| title= Population census of Gandara\n| 1903 = 12014\n| 1918 = 14320\n| 1939 = 18507\n| 1948 = 25048\n| 1960 = 24883\n| 1970 = 28307\n| 1975 = 30600\n| 1980 = 24764\n| 1990 = 23673\n| 1995 = 27263\n| 2000 = 28866\n| 2007 = 31222\n| 2010 = 31943\n| 2015 = 34434\n| 2020 =\n| 2025 =\n| 2030 =\n| footnote = Source: [[Philippine Statistics Authority]] {{PH census|2015}}{{PH census|2010}}{{PH census|2007}}{{LWUA population data}} \n}}\n\nBased on latest 2014 survey, the total population was 33,264, consisting of 17,046 males and 16,218 females.

They produce and consume by exchanging products to and from farm or towncenter, until a townfolk ''kadiong'' convinced them to put up a cooperative or a cooperation of Gandare\u00f1os\u2019 products to put up a bunk or a stockade and that cooperative will issue a bunknote to ease the trading of products or goods. Fellows can lend seeds or fishlings from the stockade, lenders now start with their own products and can be trade with the bunk/stockade or cooperative bunknotes. Bunknotes became rampant on the town and they decided to issue a paper and metal money as a bunknote. Products from different villages stocked at the bunk, and every village has a unique bunknote to signify their origins, aside from Bangahon were a calamity had happened they only had a few stocks but in their village that stock equivalent of a bunknote has a higher value, the village with the highest stocks is the reference stocks, their number of products divided by the reference stocks is the particular village bunknote equivalent in trading. Excess stocks in the bunk are used for the development of the town.\n\nThe cooperative is until now in service but has a different name, a bank and being run by lists of corporate stores within the town.\n\nThe Internal Revenue Allotment from the National Government Budget Management Office for Gandara was PHP 28,202,218 as of 2006.\n\n==Administrative Boundaries==\n\n===Aquatic Boundaries===\n*East 11.9935 North 124.6694 merge point of Santa Margarita, Calbayog, Tarangnan and Gandara, 10,241 meters West-Northwest of Napalisan (E 11.9895 / N 124.7305)\n*East 12.0049 / North 124.7597 between Santa Margarita and Gandera a river called Lambique-Hinagbungan River 5,521 meters Northeast of Napalisan, this river serves as a boundary between two municipalities, down to East 11.99120 / North 124.75106 of the said river 1,315 meters North of Tambongan.\n*East 11.9397 / North 124.7116 merge point of Tarangnan, Pagsanghan and Gandara, 8,909 meters South-Southwest of Napalisan (E11.9895/S\\N124.7305)\n*East 11.9723 / North 124.7532 between Pagsanghan and Gandara between an islet and an island called Cambaye and Caprangasan respectively 4,763 meters Southeast of Napalisan a river called Pagsanghan-Gandara River then to East 11.9601 / North 124.7136 midpoint of a river 881 meters East-Southeast of Lungib and 319 meters Northeast of Bangon Island a river boundary then to East 11.9710 / North 124.7265, 50 meters north of Palanas midpoint of Pagsanghan-Gandara River to the right where left is back to Caprangasan.

2013, ''British Lion'' holds a score of 56 at the aggregate review site [[Metacritic]], indicating \"mixed or average reviews\".<ref name=\"meta\"/> ''[[Record Collector]]'' awarded the album 3/5 and stated that \"though it's not entirely a chore to listen to, it is probably not memorable enough to appeal far outside of that circle [of Iron Maiden fans]\".<ref name=\"Record Collector\"/> ''[[Revolver (magazine)|Revolver]]'' also gave it a score of 3/5, although they praised the \"cohesive\" song-writing and referred to Taylor as \"a compelling hard-rock singer\".<ref name=\"Revolver\"/> [[AllMusic]] gave it a score of 2.5/5, deeming it \"a serviceable slab of unpretentious yet utterly forgettable '80s retro-metal that adheres to every clich\u00e9 in the book\".<ref name= \"AM\"/> Although they called it \"a solid \u201870s style hard rock effort\", [[About.com]] criticised some songs for being \"nothing but filler.\"<ref

himself in something a bit different with a group of excellent musicians.\"<ref name=\"Kerrang!\"/> ''[[Metal Hammer]]'' were also very positive towards the release, praising the \"infectious re-imaginings of the [[UFO (band)|UFO]] and [[Thin Lizzy]] albums that inspired their creator as a kid,\" concluding that \"This is a big hearted and ferocious triumph.\"<ref name=\"MHreview\"/> Although they criticised the album's lyrics, ''[[Classic Rock (magazine)|Classic Rock]]'' complimented vocalist Richard Taylor and guitarist Graham Leslie, concluding that \"''British Lion'' is an album that is both exactly what you'd expect, and far better than that.\"<ref name=\"CR review\"/> [[Artistdirect]] awarded it full marks, stating that \"As far as songwriters go, [Harris is] on the

I ended up managing them and producing them and writing with them.\"<ref name=\"CRAugust\">{{cite magazine|url=http://www.classicrockmagazine.com/features/iron-maidens-steve-harris-on-british-lion-solo-project/ |title=Exclusive: Iron Maiden\u2019s Steve Harris talks about his British Lion solo project |accessdate=8 September 2012 |last=Brannigan |first=Paul |date=27 August 2012 |magazine=[[Classic Rock (magazine)|Classic Rock]] |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131020112709/http://www.classicrockmagazine.com/features/iron-maidens-steve-harris-on-british-lion-solo-project/ |archivedate=20 October 2013 }}</ref> After the original band split up, he \"kept in touch with Richie [Taylor, vocals] and Graham, and then Richie was working with another guitarist called David Hawkins, who's a really talented guy, and so we started writing songs together.\"<ref name=\"CRAugust\"/> After several years of work, due to Harris being occupied with Iron Maiden, the album ultimately consists of \"six songs written with Richie and David, there's one with just me and Richie, and the others are me, Richie, Graham and a couple of other guys that were around at the time.\"<ref name=\"CRAugust\"/> In an interview published by ''[[Kerrang!]]'' in September, Harris said that he considers ''British Lion'' \"more of a side-project\" than a solo record.<ref name=\"kerrang lion\"/>\n\nStylistically, Harris argues that the record is \"more mainstream rock than metal, very British sounding, very 70s-influenced and quite commercial\u2026 but good commercial.

2013, ''British Lion'' holds a score of 56 at the aggregate review site [[Metacritic]], indicating \"mixed or average reviews\".<ref name=\"meta\"/> ''[[Record Collector]]'' awarded the album 3/5 and stated that \"though it's not entirely a chore to listen to, it is probably not memorable enough to appeal far outside of that circle [of Iron Maiden fans]\".<ref name=\"Record Collector\"/> ''[[Revolver (magazine)|Revolver]]'' also gave it a score of 3/5, although they praised the \"cohesive\" song-writing and referred to Taylor as \"a compelling hard-rock singer\".<ref name=\"Revolver\"/> [[AllMusic]] gave it a score of 2.5/5, deeming it \"a serviceable slab of unpretentious yet utterly forgettable '80s retro-metal that adheres to every clich\u00e9 in the book\".<ref name= \"AM\"/> Although they called it \"a solid \u201870s style hard rock effort\", [[About.com]] criticised some songs for being \"nothing but filler.\"<ref name=\"About.com\"/>\n\n''[[Kerrang!]]'' deemed it \"a brilliant album\", describing it as \"the sound of an incredibly talented songwriter stepping outside of what he'd normally do and indulging himself in something a bit different with a group of excellent musicians.\"<ref name=\"Kerrang!\"/> ''[[Metal Hammer]]'' were also very positive towards the release, praising the \"infectious re-imaginings of the [[UFO (band)|UFO]] and [[Thin Lizzy]] albums that inspired their creator as a kid,\" concluding that \"This is a big hearted and ferocious triumph.\"<ref name=\"MHreview\"/> Although they criticised the album's lyrics, ''[[Classic Rock (magazine)|Classic Rock]]'' complimented vocalist Richard Taylor and guitarist Graham Leslie, concluding that \"''British Lion'' is an album that is both exactly what you'd expect, and far better than that.\"<ref name=\"CR review\"/> [[Artistdirect]] awarded it full marks, stating that \"As far as songwriters go, [Harris is] on the level with [[Jimmy Page]] and [[Tony Iommi]], and his new album, ''British Lion'', proves that tenfold\".<ref name=\"artistdirect\"/>\n\n==Track listing==\nAll songs are written by [[Steve Harris
