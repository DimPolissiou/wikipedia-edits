Most people go in the Oval Office, even people who go in there a lot, have a tendency in front of the President of the United States to always leave something on the table.\" He said, \"Don't leave anything on the table.\" He said, \"You're going to get about 15 minutes at best and put it all out there.

Most people go in the Oval Office, even people who go in there a lot, have a tendency in front of the President of the United States to always leave something on the table.\" He said, \"Don't leave anything on the table.\" He said, \"You're going to get about 15 minutes at best and put it all out there.
