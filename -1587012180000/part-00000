Once home to a bank, theater, and pub, the town has declined over the years, both economically and in population. In the past five years,{{when|date=April 2020}} small population growth and the addition of a new caf\u00e9 have brought new life to the town. Annually in September, the Good Ole Days Festival celebrates the town's past with a parade, cookout, and concert.\n\nStringtown was founded{{when|date=April 2020}}  in [[Atoka County, Choctaw Nation]], a [[History of Oklahoma#Indian and Oklahoma Territories|territorial-era]] government unit that included parts of today's Atoka, Coal, Hughes, and Pittsburg counties.\n\nOn August 5, 1932, while [[Bonnie Parker]] was visiting her mother, [[Clyde Barrow]] and two associates were drinking alcohol at a dance in Stringtown (illegal under [[Prohibition in the United States|Prohibition]]). They were approached by Sheriff C. G. Maxwell and his deputy, at which time Clyde opened fire, killing deputy Eugene C. Moore. That was the first killing of a lawman by what was later known as the Barrow Gang, a total which would eventually amount to nine slain officers.\n\nIn the 1940s during [[World War II]], [[Fritz Johann Hansgirg]], the Austrian inventor of magnesium and [[heavy water]] processes was interned at the [[Internment of German Americans|U.S. alien internment camp]] located in Stringtown.\n\nIn the late 1960s, a [[tornado]] touched down in the town directly on top of the (then) recently built Community Center, now the Senior Citizens Center. The tornado was only on the ground for a few seconds, but during that time the building was almost destroyed. It was an unusual occurrence for a tornado to touch down in the town itself, given its location between two chains of steep hills.\n\nThe nearby Mack Alford State Penitentiary is a large source of employment in the county. It was an [[internment camp]] for [[Internment of Japanese Americans|Japanese Americans]] arrested as \"enemy aliens\" and later for German [[prisoner of war|POWs]] during World War II.<ref>[http://encyclopedia.densho.org/Stringtown%20%28detention%20facility%29/ \"Stringtown (detention facility)\"] ''Densho Encyclopedia''.

On January 14, 2014, the Oklahoma Highway Patrol disbanded the Stringtown Police Department for generating too much of the city\u2019s revenue off of writing traffic tickets, a violation of the state \"speed trap\" law.<ref>\"[http://www.cbsnews.com/news/speed-trap-profits-could-come-end-small-town-new-laws/ New laws aim to put brakes on nation's speed traps]\", [[CBS News]]; retrieved May 03, 2017.</ref>\n\nThe Garside house is one of the biggest historical sites of the town, next to the Bonnie and Clyde monument. The land the Garside house sits on was allotted to Joseph and Sarah Garside and their two children in 1902. In the middle of building the house, a tornado came through the town and tore down the part of the house that had been built. The Garsides had to start over again, but in 1915 they finished a two-story house. The house and land was later purchased by E. H. Colbertson, the first white man to buy land in that area. Approximately four years ago, the house was remodeled and decorated to be a museum.\n\nThe Southwest Stone Company, also known as the Rock Crusher, is one of the biggest sources of employment in the county. The crusher moved from Chockee to Stringtown in the early 1900s. Up until that point, Stringtown had not had electricity yet. \n\nThe railroad that runs through Stringtown stretches from south Texas, takes several routes in Oklahoma and Kansas, and reaches to the northern parts of Missouri. The part that runs through Stringtown was built in 1872 and is known now as the [[Union Pacific Railroad]].\n\nStringtown was once home to a [[sawmill]] and a [[cotton gin]] that had the biggest production rate in the late 1800s. When a fire burnt the town on July 15, 1954, the sawmill and cotton gin burned down, along with half the town, including a caf\u00e9, a jailhouse, a barbershop, a bank, and a hotel. All that was left was Robert\u2019s Store and a few homes. The town never really was rebuilt after this. Today, there is a school, a church, a fire department, City Hall, Dianna\u2019s Store, and a senior citizens center.\n\nA state investigation revealed that 76 percent of the Stringtown's 2013 budget came from traffic tickets. The investigation found excessive speed trapping, and the police department was disbanded in 2014.\n\n==Government and infrastructure==\n[[Image:Stringtown Post Office.jpg|thumb|right|The old Stringtown Post Office, which was demolished early in the 1990s as it had become structurally unsound.]]\nThe [[United States Postal Service]] operates the Stringtown Post Office.<ref>\"[http://usps.whitepages.com/service/post_office/stringtown-107-e-reba-mcentire-ave-stringtown-ok-1383770 Post Office Location - STRINGTOWN]\", [[United States Postal Service]]; retrieved November 22, 2010.</ref>\n\nThe [[Oklahoma Department of Corrections]] operates the [[Mack Alford Correctional Center]] in an [[unincorporated area]] in [[Atoka County, Oklahoma|Atoka County]], near Stringtown.<ref>\"[http://www.doc.state.ok.us/facilities/institutions/macc.htm Mack Alford Correctional Center] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130404095358/http://www.doc.state.ok.us/facilities/institutions/macc.htm |date=2013-04-04 }}\", [[Oklahoma Department of Corrections]]; retrieved November 22, 2010.</ref>\n\n==Demographics==\n{{US Census population\n|1920= 360\n|1930= 558\n|1940= 718\n|1950= 499\n|1960= 414\n|1970= 397\n|1980= 1047\n|1990= 366\n|2000= 396\n|2010= 410\n|estyear=2018\n|estimate=399\n|estref=<ref name=\"USCensusEst2018CenPopScriptOnlyDirtyFixDoNotUse\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/data/tables.2018.html|title=Population and Housing Unit Estimates|accessdate=June 4, 2019}}</ref>\n|footnote=U.S. Decennial Census<ref name=\"DecennialCensus\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/decennial-census.html|title=Census of Population and Housing|publisher=Census.gov|accessdate=June 4, 2015}}</ref>\n}}\n\nAs of the [[census]]<ref name=\"GR2\" /> of 2000, there were 396 people, 166 households, and 113 families residing in the town.

On January 14, 2014, the Oklahoma Highway Patrol disbanded the Stringtown Police Department for generating too much of the city\u2019s revenue off of writing traffic tickets, a violation of the state \"speed trap\" law.<ref>\"[http://www.cbsnews.com/news/speed-trap-profits-could-come-end-small-town-new-laws/ New laws aim to put brakes on nation's speed traps]\", [[CBS News]]; retrieved May 03, 2017.</ref>\n\nThe Garside house is one of the biggest historical sites of the town, next to the Bonnie and Clyde monument. The land the Garside house sits on was allotted to Joseph and Sarah Garside and their two kids in 1902. In the middle of building the house, a tornado came through the town and tore down the part of the house that had been built. The Garside\u2019s had to start from the bottom again but they finished in 1915 with a beautiful two-story house. The house and land was later purchased by E. H. Colbertson, who just so happened to be the first white man to buy land in that area. Approximately four years ago, the house was remodeled and decorated to be a museum.\n\nThe Southwest Stone Company, also known as the Rock Crusher, is another big part of the town\u2019s history and is one of the biggest sources of employment in the county. The crusher moved from Chockee to Stringtown in the early 1900s. Up until this point Stringtown had not had electricity yet. \nThe railroad that runs through Stringtown stretch\u2019s from south Texas, takes several routes in Oklahoma and Kansas, and reaches to the Northern parts of Missouri. The part that runs through Stringtown was built in 1872 and is known now as the Union Pacific Railroad.\n\nStringtown was once home to a sawmill and a cotton gin that had the biggest production rate in the late 1800s. When the fire came through the town on July 15, 1954, the sawmill and cotton gin burned down, along with half the town. Stringtown had a caf\u00e9, a jailhouse, a barbershop, a bank, and a hotel that also burned down that day. All that was left was Robert\u2019s Store and a few homes. The town never really rebuilt after this. Today, there is a school, a church, a fire department, City Hall, Dianna\u2019s store, and a senior citizens building.\n\nA state investigation revealed that 76 percent of the Stringtown's 2013 budget came from traffic tickets. The investigation found excessive speed trapping, and the police department was disbanded in 2014.\n\n==Government and infrastructure==\n[[Image:Stringtown Post Office.jpg|thumb|right|The old Stringtown Post Office, which was demolished early in the 1990s as it had become structurally unsound.]]\nThe [[United States Postal Service]] operates the Stringtown Post Office.<ref>\"[http://usps.whitepages.com/service/post_office/stringtown-107-e-reba-mcentire-ave-stringtown-ok-1383770 Post Office Location - STRINGTOWN]\", [[United States Postal Service]]; retrieved November 22, 2010.</ref>\n\nThe [[Oklahoma Department of Corrections]] operates the [[Mack Alford Correctional Center]] in an [[unincorporated area]] in [[Atoka County, Oklahoma|Atoka County]], near Stringtown.<ref>\"[http://www.doc.state.ok.us/facilities/institutions/macc.htm Mack Alford Correctional Center] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130404095358/http://www.doc.state.ok.us/facilities/institutions/macc.htm |date=2013-04-04 }}\", [[Oklahoma Department of Corrections]]; retrieved November 22, 2010.</ref>\n\n==Demographics==\n{{US Census population\n|1920= 360\n|1930= 558\n|1940= 718\n|1950= 499\n|1960= 414\n|1970= 397\n|1980= 1047\n|1990= 366\n|2000= 396\n|2010= 410\n|estyear=2018\n|estimate=399\n|estref=<ref name=\"USCensusEst2018CenPopScriptOnlyDirtyFixDoNotUse\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/data/tables.2018.html|title=Population and Housing Unit Estimates|accessdate=June 4, 2019}}</ref>\n|footnote=U.S. Decennial Census<ref name=\"DecennialCensus\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/decennial-census.html|title=Census of Population and Housing|publisher=Census.gov|accessdate=June 4, 2015}}</ref>\n}}\n\nAs of the [[census]]<ref name=\"GR2\" /> of 2000, there were 396 people, 166 households, and 113 families residing in the town.

Plankton''' and '''Karen''' are fictional characters in the American [[animated series|animated television series]] ''[[SpongeBob SquarePants]]''. They are respectively voiced by [[Mr. Lawrence]] and [[Jill Talley]]. Their first appearance was in the episode \"Plankton!\" that premiered on July 31, 1999. They were created and designed by [[marine biology|marine biologist]] and animator [[Stephen Hillenburg]], the creator of the series, with additional character development by Lawrence.\n\nPlankton and Karen are the married owners of the unsuccessful Chum Bucket restaurant. Plankton is an intellectual [[plankton]]ic [[copepod]] and Karen is a waterproof supercomputer. Plankton shares a rivalry with [[Mr. Krabs]], who owns the far more profitable [[Krusty Krab]] restaurant and sells a fictional burger called the [[Krabby Patty]]. Plankton and Karen often devise schemes to steal the secret Krabby Patty recipe, but their efforts are always thwarted by Krabs and his employees.\n\nCritics have praised the characters\u2019 voices and dialogue together. They began as minor characters, but Lawrence developed their personalities throughout the show's early seasons and they eventually became the franchise's main [[antagonist]]s.

Plankton''' and '''Karen''' are fictional characters in the American [[animated series|animated television series]] ''[[SpongeBob SquarePants]]''. They are respectively voiced by [[Mr. Lawrence]] and [[Jill Talley]]. Their first appearance was in the episode \"Plankton!\" that premiered on July 31, 1999. They were created and designed by [[marine biology|marine biologist]] and animator [[Stephen Hillenburg]], the creator of the series, with additional character development by Lawrence.\n\nPlankton and Karen are the married owners of the unsuccessful Chum Bucket restaurant. Plankton is an intellectual [[plankton]]ic [[copepod]] and Karen is a waterproof supercomputer. Plankton shares a rivalry with [[Mr. Krabs]], who owns the far more profitable [[Krusty Krab]] restaurant and sells a fictional burger called the [[Krabby Patty]]. Plankton and Karen often devise schemes to steal the secret Krabby Patty recipe, but their efforts are always thwarted by Krabs and his employees.\n\nCritics have praised the characters\u2019 voices and dialogue together. They began as minor characters, but Lawrence developed their personalities throughout the show's early seasons and they eventually became the franchise's main [[antagonist]]s. The Planktons play central roles in the [[The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie|2004 theatrical film]], which promoted them both to main cast members in its credits, and the [[The SpongeBob Movie: Sponge Out of Water|2015 film]]. They have also been featured in a variety of spin-off media, including tie-in publications, playsets and other merchandise.\n\n==Plankton==\n===Role in ''SpongeBob SquarePants''===\n{{quote box|align=right|bgcolor=#c6dbf7|width=34em|style=max-width:40%\n|quote=[Plankton is a] complex, wounded character who is really looking for a friend in a way, but can't let that happen because of his evil front.

Outside of business, he seems to have a somewhat friendly relationship with SpongeBob.

The movie has been described by ''[[The Guardian]]'' as a \"buddy film\" between Plankton and SpongeBob.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/feb/03/spongebob-movie-sponge-out-of-water-first-look-review|title=The SpongeBob Movie: Sponge Out of Water first look review \u2013 superhero slugfest drags a good sequel down|work=[[The Guardian]]|publisher=[[Guardian Media Group]]|last=Hoffman|first=Jordan|date=February 3, 2015}}</ref> Series creator [[Stephen Hillenburg]] considers Plankton \"more of a caricature of a villain\" than a truly evil character.<ref name=\"Beck102\"/>\n\n===Development===\nWhen ''SpongeBob SquarePants'' premiered, Plankton was not part of the series' main cast. Plankton's voice actor, [[Mr. Lawrence]], has stated that after producing Plankton's debut episode in the late 1990s, creator Stephen Hillenburg was unsure if he would continue to use the character. After recording it, Hillenburg was noncommittal, telling Lawrence: \"We'll probably do another [Plankton episode] next year,\" <ref name=\"Beck111\"/> Lawrence summarized Plankton's origins in 2015, saying that he \"was only supposed to be in one or two episodes, but I was a writer on the show and I really liked this character\".<ref name=\"courier\">{{cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/138093814/|title=Meet the voice behind a 'SpongeBob' character|newspaper=[[Courier News]]|publisher=[[Gannett Company]]|last=Bourbeau|first=Mary Ann|date=November 15, 2015}}</ref> Following his first voice recording as Plankton, Lawrence drafted some of his own ideas for the character and passed them to Hillenburg.

Lawrence considers the [[SpongeBob SquarePants (season 3)|third season]] the first in which Plankton is a main character.<ref name=\"Beck111\"/>\n\nDuring production on ''SpongeBob''{{'}}s early seasons, Lawrence was the only staff member writing premises and outlines involving Plankton. At the time, he felt he \"had to prove Plankton could survive as more than a one-note character\".<ref name=\"Beck105\"/> Since then, multiple writers have written for Plankton without Lawrence's involvement, including the teams of writers responsible for Plankton's starring roles in both ''SpongeBob'' films. Lawrence continues to write Plankton episodes, having said in 2015, \"I'm not just his voice.

Julia won the challenge and chose the core ingredient for the invention test: goat. In the end, Justine, Julia and Chris pleased the judges with their goat dishes. Despite their dishes being deemed the best two, Julia and Justine had minor flaws (burnt pastry, overcooked goat respectively) and for this, Chris was ultimately deemed the winner. For his prize, he was given a view of the dish they were to cook in the Mystery Box eliminator challenge the next day, thereby giving him an advantage over the other contestants to plan his dish.\n| 1,978,000\n| 1st\n| 2nd\n|-\n|height=\"10\"| 67/12-2\n| Monday 13 July 2009\n| '''Elimination Challenge 1''' - The contestants had to make two pies - one sweet and one savoury, making their own pastry. Almost all the contestants struggled to make time, with only Poh and Chris being able to prepare both their pies to a suitable standard before judging. In the end, Lucas was criticised for neglecting to use \"the most simple seasoning\" - salt, and was also scolded for his poor presentations of both his pies. Julia was applauded for her pastry but heavily chastised for leaving part of her pies uncooked. Chris was commended for his surprising Fish Pie and Lime Tart while Justine was faced strong criticism for failing to balance the filling, which the judges praised, with suitable pastry. Julie was reprimanded by the judges for her \"Puddle Pie\" which the judges deemed as one of the worst, however, they believed that her other pie, a Chicken and Mushroom pie was up to a suitable standard. Poh produced two pies that were deemed as some of the best visually; guest Judge Luke deemed her vegetable and blue cheese pie the best, while all the judges favoured her rhubarb, hazelnut and chocolate '[[open sandwich]]' pie. After discussion, the judges deemed Lucas, Julia and Julie as producing some of the worst pies in the bunch. They chose to spare Julia first as they believed her Chocolate Pie was stronger, then chose Julie as she produced one good pie whilst Lucas produced two poor ones. Lucas was the first finalist sent home.\nThe judges then deemed Poh, Justine and Chris as the Top 3 and chose Poh for her presentation and for producing the best tasting pies of the finalist and her ability to \"modernise\" the pie theme; the use of hazelnut, chocolate and rhubarb in a pie, Matt highlighted as never having been done with success until now. She, like Chris was given an advantage: to choose the theme for the following eliminator.\n| 2,119,000\n| 1st\n| rowspan=5| <small>(2,193,000)</small> 1st\n|-\n|height=\"10\"| 68/12-3\n| Tuesday 14 July 2009\n| '''Elimination Challenge 2''' - As Poh had won the pie challenge she designated Malaysian as the theme and picked coconut cream and ling fish for the core ingredients. The contestants had 90 minutes to make two courses. Guest judge Matt Moran told Chris he had been following his progress during the competition and thought some of his dishes had been brilliant. However, at this stage he\u2019d expect Chris\u2019 food to be better; his ling fried rice dish didn\u2019t appeal to Matt whatsoever. George said Chris\u2019 pannacotta was too hard. Gary said Poh\u2019s petai with sambal and fish custard was a fresh and vibrant dish. George thought it was interesting and tasty. Matt said her dessert of glutenous rice dumpling with coconut pandan leaf stuffing didn\u2019t look appealing but its flavour packed a punch. Gary told an upset Julia that the fish in her Malaysian broth was raw. Matt said the broth was too intense with no connection to Malaysian food and the fish wasn\u2019t cooked enough. Matt said he had been worried about the use of zucchini and udon noodles in Julie\u2019s vegetable coconut curry because it wasn\u2019t Malay but he could taste some nice Malaysian flavours in the dish. Gary told Julie the ling which she had served with peanut sauce wasn\u2019t cooked properly. Gary said the sauce of her fish dish was good, with a nice depth of flavour. George told Justine her sauce was zippy, gutsy and he loved the colour. Matt thought Justine\u2019s rice pudding was delicious.\nThe judges told the contestants Justine and Poh had made the best meals, with Poh the winner of the challenge. Matt told Poh her dessert was the \u201ckiller\u201d dish of the day. Chris, Julia and Julie had made the worst dishes. Chris was told he was safe and then Julia was eliminated. As the winner of the challenge Poh was again given an advantage for the following challenge.

In the end, Julie was the only contestant who managed to add all the decorations to the dish and Chris was the finalist deemed to have produced the best cake. Poh and Justine both struggled and the judges were shown to have a difficult time deciding. Guest judge Bill Granger praised Poh's superb palette whilst he also favoured Justine's technical abilities.\nUltimately, the judges considered Poh's effort to be slightly better and Justine was the next finalist to leave in a teary elimination.\n| 2,231,000\n| 1st\n|-\n|height=\"10\"| 70/12-5\n| Thursday 16 July 2009\n| '''Elimination Challenge 4''' - The final elimination round before the final saw the contestants cooking the dishes they would include in self-authored recipe books with cookbook writer Donna Hay acting as the guest judge. Poh chose a traditional Chinese Malaysian style book that would include unusual, exotic recipes while Chris' book included hearty meals that utilised beer, and sought to fulfil a \"snout to tail\" approach to cooking animals. Julie's idea was a home recipe cookbook that would inspire other families. This impressed Donna Hay greatly and she stated that she wished to \"steal (the idea).\" In the end, Poh's dishes impressed the judges with presentation and taste, despite being described as \"acquired,\" and was deemed the best of the three. She was then given a place in the Finals while Julie and Chris landed in the Bottom 2. Julie struggled due to her poor time management which saw her unable to complete any of her dishes while Chris's completed dishes were not visually accepted by Donna Hay and in the main disappointed taste-wise. Ultimately, what Julie had managed to cook coupled with her cook-book idea was enough to save her and Chris was subsequently eliminated.\n| 2,360,000\n| 1st\n|-\n|height=\"10\"| 71/12-6\n| Friday 17 July 2009\n| '''Masterclass Reunion''' - The Top 20 contestants were reunited in the final Masterclass and revealed what they have been up to since leaving the show.

Only Julia and Poh impressed the judges while the other contestants were given harsh criticism for making dishes that were too simple (Julie and Lucas both made Potato and Leek Soup, Chris a French Onion Soup and Justine with a Roasted Bell Pepper Omelette) and also failed to have the \"refined\" level of taste for MasterChef Finals Week. Julia won the challenge and chose the core ingredient for the invention test: goat. In the end, Justine, Julia and Chris pleased the judges with their goat dishes. Despite their dishes being deemed the best two, Julia and Justine had minor flaws (burnt pastry, overcooked goat respectively) and for this, Chris was ultimately deemed the winner. For his prize, he was given a view of the dish they were to cook in the Mystery Box eliminator challenge the next day, thereby giving him an advantage over the other contestants to plan his dish.\n| 1,978,000\n| 1st\n| 2nd\n|-\n|height=\"10\"| 67/12-2\n| Monday 13 July 2009\n| '''Elimination Challenge 1''' - The contestants had to make two pies - one sweet and one savoury, making their own pastry. Almost all the contestants struggled to make time, with only Poh and Chris being able to prepare both their pies to a suitable standard before judging. In the end, Lucas was criticised for neglecting to use \"the most simple seasoning\" - salt, and was also scolded for his poor presentations of both his pies. Julia was applauded for her pastry but heavily chastised for leaving part of her pies uncooked. Chris was commended for his surprising Fish Pie and Lime Tart while Justine was faced strong criticism for failing to balance the filling, which the judges praised, with suitable pastry. Julie was reprimanded by the judges for her \"Puddle Pie\" which the judges deemed as one of the worst, however, they believed that her other pie, a Chicken and Mushroom pie was up to a suitable standard. Poh produced two pies that were deemed as some of the best visually; guest Judge Luke deemed her vegetable and blue cheese pie the best, while all the judges favoured her rhubarb, hazelnut and chocolate '[[open sandwich]]' pie. After discussion, the judges deemed Lucas, Julia and Julie as producing some of the worst pies in the bunch. They chose to spare Julia first as they believed her Chocolate Pie was stronger, then chose Julie as she produced one good pie whilst Lucas produced two poor ones. Lucas was the first finalist sent home.\nThe judges then deemed Poh, Justine and Chris as the Top 3 and chose Poh for her presentation and for producing the best tasting pies of the finalist and her ability to \"modernise\" the pie theme; the use of hazelnut, chocolate and rhubarb in a pie, Matt highlighted as never having been done with success until now. She, like Chris was given an advantage: to choose the theme for the following eliminator.\n| 2,119,000\n| 1st\n| rowspan=5| <small>(2,193,000)</small> 1st\n|-\n|height=\"10\"| 68/12-3\n| Tuesday 14 July 2009\n| '''Elimination Challenge 2''' - As Poh had won the pie challenge she designated Malaysian as the theme and picked coconut cream and ling fish for the core ingredients. The contestants had 90 minutes to make two courses. Guest judge Matt Moran told Chris he had been following his progress during the competition and thought some of his dishes had been brilliant. However, at this stage he\u2019d expect Chris\u2019 food to be better; his ling fried rice dish didn\u2019t appeal to Matt whatsoever. George said Chris\u2019 pannacotta was too hard. Gary said Poh\u2019s petai with sambal and fish custard was a fresh and vibrant dish. George thought it was interesting and tasty. Matt said her dessert of glutenous rice dumpling with coconut pandan leaf stuffing didn\u2019t look appealing but its flavour packed a punch. Gary told an upset Julia that the fish in her Malaysian broth was raw. Matt said the broth was too intense with no connection to Malaysian food and the fish wasn\u2019t cooked enough. Matt said he had been worried about the use of zucchini and udon noodles in Julie\u2019s vegetable coconut curry because it wasn\u2019t Malay but he could taste some nice Malaysian flavours in the dish. Gary told Julie the ling which she had served with peanut sauce wasn\u2019t cooked properly. Gary said the sauce of her fish dish was good, with a nice depth of flavour. George told Justine her sauce was zippy, gutsy and he loved the colour. Matt thought Justine\u2019s rice pudding was delicious.\nThe judges told the contestants Justine and Poh had made the best meals, with Poh the winner of the challenge. Matt told Poh her dessert was the \u201ckiller\u201d dish of the day. Chris, Julia and Julie had made the worst dishes. Chris was told he was safe and then Julia was eliminated. As the winner of the challenge Poh was again given an advantage for the following challenge. She was able to see and taste the pressure test dish the contestants will cook in the next challenge and was given the recipe to study overnight.\n| 2,191,000\n| 1st\n|-\n|height=\"10\"| 69/12-4\n| Wednesday 15 July 2009\n| '''Elimination Challenge 3''' -  The third elimination challenge emulated the pressure test challenge where the contestants had to make a several layered 'Chocolate Mousse' cake. In the end, Julie was the only contestant who managed to add all the decorations to the dish and Chris was the finalist deemed to have produced the best cake. Poh and Justine both struggled and the judges were shown to have a difficult time deciding. Guest judge Bill Granger praised Poh's superb palette whilst he also favoured Justine's technical abilities.\nUltimately, the judges considered Poh's effort to be slightly better and Justine was the next finalist to leave in a teary elimination.\n| 2,231,000\n| 1st\n|-\n|height=\"10\"| 70/12-5\n| Thursday 16 July 2009\n| '''Elimination Challenge 4''' - The final elimination round before the final saw the contestants cooking the dishes they would include in self-authored recipe books with cookbook writer Donna Hay acting as the guest judge. Poh chose a traditional Chinese Malaysian style book that would include unusual, exotic recipes while Chris' book included hearty meals that utilised beer, and sought to fulfil a \"snout to tail\" approach to cooking animals. Julie's idea was a home recipe cookbook that would inspire other families. This impressed Donna Hay greatly and she stated that she wished to \"steal (the idea).\" In the end, Poh's dishes impressed the judges with presentation and taste, despite being described as \"acquired,\" and was deemed the best of the three. She was then given a place in the Finals while Julie and Chris landed in the Bottom 2. Julie struggled due to her poor time management which saw her unable to complete any of her dishes while Chris's completed dishes were not visually accepted by Donna Hay and in the main disappointed taste-wise. Ultimately, what Julie had managed to cook coupled with her cook-book idea was enough to save her and Chris was subsequently eliminated.\n| 2,360,000\n| 1st\n|-\n|height=\"10\"| 71/12-6\n| Friday 17 July 2009\n| '''Masterclass Reunion''' - The Top 20 contestants were reunited in the final Masterclass and revealed what they have been up to since leaving the show.

P. Matthen ('''May 18th 1890\u2013June 2nd 1960)  was a Member of the Indian Parliament in the first Lok Sabha to be constituted in 1952 after India gained Independence from Britain. He represented the Thiruvalla constituency of Kerala. Matthen was appointed the Indian Ambassador to Sudan after his single term in the Lok Sabha. Before his entry into politics, Matthen was  businessman with interests in cashew, minerals, insurance, plantations and banking. He was responsible for starting the Alleppey Chamber of Commerce. He was Managing Director of  the Travancore National & Quilon (TN&Q) Bank when it suffered a run of unprecedented length that forced it to close. The bank run was said to have been exacerbated by Sir C. P. Ramaswami Iyer, the Dewan of Travancore, in an attempt to reduce the power of the Christian Community who were agitating for fair representation in the governing council of this Princely State. C.P. Matthen was extradited from Madras and imprisoned in Trivandrum, allegedly for balance sheet irregularities. He was sentenced to rigorous imprisonment but offered many chances to walk free if he would acknowledge guilt. C. P. Matthen refused these offers, maintaining his innocence for more than three years. He became something of a folk hero for his uncompromising stand. He was released on January 22nd 1942 without condition or explanation and returned to Madras.  \n\n== Early life ==\nCP Matthen was born into a landed Christian family in central Travancore, in [[Kavumbhagom]], Thiruvalla. It was unusual in that agricultural economy, even for landed families, to educate their children beyond high school, but Matthen went to Madras after high school and did his Bachelor Of History degree at Madras Christian College (MCC). He completed his education with a Bachelor of Law. \n\n== Insurance and Banking ==\nAt the age of 29, Matthen raised Rs 56,000 in capital and Rs 54,000 in deposits and started a bank that he called the Quilon Bank with its headquarters in Kollum (Quilon), The Quilon Bank headquarter building was then constructed and completed in 1935. In a relatively short space of 15 years, the bank\u2019s total working capital rose from Rs 156,000 to Rs 10,246,000.\n\nAnother leading Travancore businessman of that era was Mr [[K. C. Mammen Mappillai]], whose interests were not only in banking - his bank was called the Travancore National Bank - but also in journalism, newspaper publishing and politics, his heart was actually in journalism. He was the Chief Editor of a Travancore newspaper, [[Malayala Manorama]]. \n\nMammen and Matthen had started an insurance company together, and the commercial success of this new venture led them to amalgamate their respective banks in 1937. The registered office remained at the Quilon Bank headquarters in Travancore but the main business of the bank was conducted from its central office in Madras where its primary shareholders were based. Sir CP Ramaswami Iyer, encouraged this arrangement by offering to place Rs 7,000,000 of Travancore treasury money with the merged bank but this offer was never fulfilled.   \n\nThe TN&Q Bank was the fourth-largest bank in India and the largest in South India. It had 75 branches in British India, Travancore, Cochin, the Malabar, Coorg, Mysore and Ceylon:<ref>{{Cite book|last=Association|url=http://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.218123|title=The Calcutta Stock Exchange Offical Year Book 1938|date=1938}}</ref> Alleppey, Alwaye, Athirampuzha, Bangalore City, Bangalore Cantt.(South Parade Road), Bangalore Cantt.(Central Street), Bombay, Calcutta, Calicut, Changanacherry, Chirayinkil, Cochin, Coimbatore, Colombo, Coonoor, Cuddapah, Devicolam, Dindigul, Ernakulam, Erode, Galle, Hyderabad, Jaffna, Kandy, Karaikudi, Kayamkulam, Kottayam, Kumbakonam, Madras: Anderson Hall, G.T., Flower Bazaar, Mount Road, Triplicane, Mylapore, Vepery, Thyagarayanagar, Royapettah, Madura, Mangalore, Marthandorn, Mercara, Munnar, Mysore, Nagercoil, New Delhi, Ootacamund, Palghat, Parur, Perumpavoor, Pollachi, Poona, Pudukottah, Quilon, Quilon Sub Office, Rajapalayam, Salem, Secunderabad, Shertallai, Srirangam, Tellicherry, Tenkasi, Tinnevelly, Tinnevelly Junction, Tirupur, Thiruvella, Trichinopoly (25 Lascjar Street), Trichinopoly (Chinnakadai Teppakulam), Trichur, Trippunittura, Trivandrum (Main Road), Trivandrum (Chalai Bazaar), Tuticorin, Udumalpet, Vellore, Virudhunagar, Vizagapatam.  \n\n==Imprisonment==\nTN&Q Bank was established in 1937 with a new Quilon headquarters building which Matthen built at a cost of Rs. 140,000 (a very large sum of money at that time). To retain the business and deposits of the Travancore State, Matthen and Mammen had not only agreed to the headquarters in Travancore but that two of the bank\u2019s directors were the Dewan\u2019s appointees and also that the Bank\u2019s General Manager, a confidant of the Dewan named K. S. Ramanujam, was appointed at the specific recommendation of Sir CP. Despite this initial support from the Travancore Government, within a few months of amalgamation being completed, rumors started making its rounds that the bank was insolvent, and by 1938 there was a run on the bank\u2019s assets \u2013 this was instigated not only by the Dewan but was publicized by the Travancore State\u2019s Department of Publicity. The bank\u2019s financial run concluded with 88% of the public\u2019s deposits being returned by the bank, and the bank becoming insolvent. At this point the trap was sprung, by Sir CP\u2019s administration demanding the extradition of Matthen and Mammen from Madras Presidency to Travancore State to stand trial for defrauding the public. Sir CP also convinced the British Government in Madras that the bank and its directors had been financing the Congress party and the Independence movement, so appeals to the Madras High Court and the Privy Council in London to stay the extradition orders were rejected and 3 directors of the bank including Matthen, Mammen and Mammen\u2019s elder brother and Mammen\u2019s son, were transported in chains from Madras to Quilon to stand trial.\n\nAt the trial in Trivandrum, the erstwhile General Manager of the bank - K. S. Ramanujam, who was the nominee of the Maharaja's government - falsely testified that Mammen and Matthen had defrauded the bank and four directors (including Mammen\u2019s brother and son) were then awarded 8 years\u2019 imprisonment. The bank\u2019s remaining assets were liquidated by the State, and the bank\u2019s assets were distributed - mainly to confidants of Sir C. P. Ramaswamy Aiyer, one of whom acquired the bank headquarters\u2019 building in Quilon for Rs 15,000 - approximately a tenth of what it had cost to build three years earlier. With the first year in jail, Mammen\u2019s imprisoned elder brother died a broken man. Soon afterwards, Sir CP, who had been an astute lawyer in the colonial administration, being keenly aware of the weaknesses in the Government\u2019s case \u2013 which depended on K. S. Ramanujam who vanished abroad after the trial - sent word to Mammen and Matthen that if they admitted their accused guilt and sought the Maharaja\u2019s mercy they could be pardoned. Mammen and his son, had other major family problems, so they agreed to sign the false declaration but Matthen continued to refuse. Sir CP initially declined to agree to the release without all of three of them admitting guilt, but finally released Mammen and his son on receiving their written \u201cconfessions\u201d. Matthen continued to hold out on his refusal to sign any false confession, despite heavy pressure brought on him through the Inspector General of Police, Mr Abdul Karim, visiting him regularly in jail and suggesting that he sign a letter \u2013 which the IG had drafted, requesting the Maharaja to pardon and release him.\nFinally, on 22nd January 1942, Mr. C. P. Matthen was unconditionally released by the Maharaja's Government without any written or verbal false admission of guilt. The IG, Mr. Abdul Karim, took Matthen in his official car from Travancore jail to his house where his family had waited patiently for his release from jail.\n\n==Member of Parliament==\nMr. C. P. Matthen was a member of the First [[Lok Sabha]] (Indian Parliament) in 1952, representing [[Mavelikara]] Constituency of [[Kerala]].\n\n==Lok Sabha Member and Ambassador==\nHe was elected to the first Lok Sabha in 1953, from Mavelikera constitutioncy in Kerala by one of the largest majorities of that election.  \n\nAfter completing his term in the [[Lok Sabha]], in 1957, he was appointed as the Indian Ambassador to [[Sudan]].

P. Matthen ('''May 18th 1890\u2013June 2nd 1960)  was a Member of the Indian Parliament in the first Lok Sabha to be constituted in 1952 after India gained Independence from Britain. He represented the Thiruvalla constituency of Kerala. Matthen was appointed the Indian Ambassador to Sudan after his single term in the Lok Sabha. Before his entry into politics, Matthen was  businessman with interests in cashew, minerals, insurance, plantations and banking. He was responsible for starting the Alleppey Chamber of Commerce. He was Managing Director of  the Travancore National & Quilon (TN&Q) Bank when it suffered a run of unprecedented length that forced it to close. The bank run was said to have been exacerbated by Sir C. P. Ramaswami Iyer, the Dewan of Travancore, in an attempt to reduce the power of the Christian Community who were agitating for fair representation in the governing council of this Princely State. C.P. Matthen was extradited from Madras and imprisoned in Trivandrum, allegedly for balance sheet irregularities. He was sentenced to rigorous imprisonment but offered many chances to walk free if he would acknowledge guilt. C. P. Matthen refused these offers, maintaining his innocence for more than three years. He became something of a folk hero for his uncompromising stand. He was released on January 22nd 1942 without condition or explanation and returned to Madras.  \n\n== Early life ==\nCP Matthen was born into a landed Christian family in central Travancore, in [[Kavumbhagom]], Thiruvalla. It was unusual in that agricultural economy, even for landed families, to educate their children beyond high school, but Matthen went to Madras after high school and did his Bachelor Of History degree at Madras Christian College (MCC). He completed his education with a Bachelor of Law. \n\n== Insurance and Banking ==\nAt the age of 29, Matthen raised Rs 56,000 in capital and Rs 54,000 in deposits and started a bank that he called the Quilon Bank with its headquarters in Kollum (Quilon), The Quilon Bank headquarter building was then constructed and completed in 1935. In a relatively short space of 15 years, the bank\u2019s total working capital rose from Rs 156,000 to Rs 10,246,000.\n\nAnother leading Travancore businessman of that era was Mr [[K. C. Mammen Mappillai]], whose interests were not only in banking - his bank was called the Travancore National Bank - but also in journalism, newspaper publishing and politics, his heart was actually in journalism. He was the Chief Editor of a Travancore newspaper, [[Malayala Manorama]]. \n\nMammen and Matthen had started an insurance company together, and the commercial success of this new venture led them to amalgamate their respective banks in 1937. The registered office remained at the Quilon Bank headquarters in Travancore but the main business of the bank was conducted from its central office in Madras where its primary shareholders were based. Sir CP Ramaswami Iyer, encouraged this arrangement by offering to place Rs 7,000,000 of Travancore treasury money with the merged bank but this offer was never fulfilled.   \n\nThe TN&Q Bank was the fourth-largest bank in India and the largest in South India.
