As the demand in the New World grew, so did the knowledge on how to cultivate it. The two primary species used were [[Oryza glaberrima]] and [[Oryza sativa]], originating from West Africa and Southeast Asia respectively. Slaveholders in the New World relied upon the skills of enslaved Africans to further cultivate both species.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Carney|first=Judith A.|date=2001|title=African Rice in the Columbian Exchange|jstor=3647168|journal=The Journal of African History|volume=42|issue=3|pages=377\u2013396|doi=10.1017/s0021853701007940}}</ref> North and South Carolina were key places where rice was grown during the slave trade, and islands of the Caribbean like Puerto Rico and Cuba were equally great centers of production. Enslaved Africans brought their knowledge of water control, milling, winnowing, and other general agrarian practices to the fields. This widespread knowledge amongst enslaved Africans eventually led to rice becoming a staple dietary item in the New World.<ref name=\"Harvard University Press\"/>\n\n==== Fruits ====\nCitrus fruits and grapes were brought to the Americas from the Mediterranean. At first these crops struggled to adapt to the climate in the New World but by the late 19th century they were growing more consistently.<ref>{{cite web |last1=McNeill |first1=J.R. |title=The Columbian Exchange |url=https://www.ncpedia.org/anchor/columbian-exchange |website=[[NCpedia]] |publisher=[[State Library of North Carolina]] |accessdate=23 October 2018}}</ref>\n\n<!-- The guava plant ([[Diospyros mespiliformis]]) originated in West Africa and is now grown in Hawaii, Florida and areas of California.\n\ncite book |last1=Twitty |first1=Michael |title=The Cooking Gene |date=2017 |publisher=HarperCollins Publishing |page=293}}\n\nNo, a) the guava is native to South America, b) Diospyros Mespiliformis is not the guava, it's the jackalberry.

Tobacco, potatoes, [[chili peppers]], [[tomatillos]], and tomatoes are all members of the [[nightshade family]]. All of these plants bear some resemblance to the [[European nightshade]] that even an amateur could deduce just by simple observation of the flowers and berries. Similar to some European Nightshade varieties, tomatoes and potatoes can be harmful or even lethal, if the wrong part of the plant is consumed at the wrong quantity. Of all the New World plants introduced to Italy, only the potato took as long as the tomato to gain acceptance.  16th-century physicians, thus, had good reason to be wary that this native Mexican fruit was poisonous and the generator of \"melancholic humours\".  In 1544, [[Pietro Andrea Mattioli]], a [[Grand Duchy of Tuscany|Tuscan]] physician and botanist, suggested that tomatoes might be edible, but no record exists of anyone consuming them at this time. On October 31, 1548, the tomato was given its first name anywhere in Europe when a house steward of [[Cosimo I de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany|Cosimo I de' Medici, Duke of Florence]], wrote to the De' Medici's private secretary that the basket of ''pomi d'oro'' \"had arrived safely\". At this time, the label ''pomi d'oro'' was also used to refer to figs, melons, and citrus fruits in treatises by scientists.<ref name=Gentilcore>''A History of the Tomato in Italy Pomodoro!'', [[David Gentilcore]] (New York, NY: Columbia University Press, 2010).</ref>\n\nIn the early years, tomatoes were mainly grown as ornamentals in Italy. For example, the [[Duchy of Florence|Florentine]] aristocrat [[Giovan Vettorio Soderini]] wrote how they \"were to be sought only for their beauty\" and were grown only in gardens or flower beds. Tomatoes were grown in elite town and country gardens in the fifty years or so following their arrival in Europe and were only occasionally depicted in works of art. However, in 1592 the head gardener at the botanical garden of [[Aranjuez]] near Madrid, under the patronage of [[Philip II of Spain]], wrote, \"it is said [tomatoes] are good for sauces\". Besides this account, tomatoes remained exotic plants grown for ornamental purposes, but rarely for culinary use. The combination of pasta with [[tomato sauce]] was developed only in the late nineteenth century. Today around {{convert|32000|acres|sigfig=2|abbr=on}} of tomatoes are cultivated in Italy, although there are still areas where relatively few tomatoes are grown and consumed.<ref name=Gentilcore/>\n\n===Livestock===\n{{further|Plains Indians#The horse}}\nInitially at least, the Columbian exchange of animals largely went in one direction, from Europe to the New World, as the Eurasian regions had domesticated many more animals. [[Horse]]s, [[donkey]]s, [[mule]]s, [[pig]]s, [[cattle]], [[sheep]], [[goat]]s, [[chicken]]s, large [[dog]]s, [[cat]]s and [[bee]]s were rapidly adopted by native peoples for transport, food, and other uses.<ref name=\"Francis2006-livestock\">{{cite encyclopedia|editor=Michael Francis, John|encyclopedia=Iberia and the Americas: Culture, Politics, and History: a Multidisciplinary Encyclopedia|title=Columbian Exchange\u2014Livestock| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OMNoS-g1h8cC&pg=PA303|year=2006|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-1-85109-421-9|pages=303\u2013308}}</ref> One of the first European exports to the Americas, the horse, changed the lives of many [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] tribes. The mountain tribes shifted to a [[nomadic]] lifestyle, as opposed to [[agriculture]], based on hunting [[bison]] on horseback and moved down to the [[Great Plains]]. The existing Plains tribes expanded their territories with horses, and the animals were considered so valuable that horse herds became a measure of wealth.<ref>[[Evolution of the horse|This transfer reintroduced horses]] to the Americas, as the species had died out there prior to the development of the modern horse in Eurasia.</ref>\n\nThe effects of the introduction of European livestock on the environments and peoples of the New World were not always positive.

Many had migrated west across Eurasia [[natural reservoir|with animals]] or people, or were brought by traders from Asia, so diseases of two continents were suffered by all occupants. While Europeans and Asians were affected by the Eurasian diseases, their [[endemic]] status in those continents over centuries resulted in many people gaining [[immunity (medical)|immunity]].\n\nBy contrast, Old World diseases had a devastating effect when introduced via European carriers, as the native people in the Americas had no natural immunity to the new diseases. [[Measles]] caused many deaths.

For example, in the article \"The Myth of Early Globalization: The Atlantic Economy, 1500\u20131800\" Pieter Emmer makes the point that \"from 1500 onward, a 'clash of cultures' had begun in the Atlantic\".<ref>Emmer, Pieter. \"The Myth of Early Globalization: The Atlantic Economy, 1500\u20131800\". European Review 11, no. 1. Feb. 2003. p. 45\u201346</ref> This clash of culture transferred European values to indigenous cultures. For example, the emergence of private property in regions where there were little to no rights to lands, the concepts of monogamy and the nuclear family, the role of women and children in the family system, and the \"superiority of free labor\".<ref>Emmer, Pieter. \"The Myth of Early Globalization: The Atlantic Economy, 1500\u20131800\". European Review 11, no. 1. Feb. 2003. p. 46</ref> An example of this type of cultural exchange occurred during the 1500s in North America. When these early European colonizers first entered North America, they encountered fence-less lands which indicated to them that this land was unimproved. For these Europeans, they were seeking economic opportunities, therefore, land and resources were important for the success of the mission. When these colonizers entered North America they encountered a fully established culture of people called the [[Powhatan]]. The Powhatan farmers in Virginia scattered their farm plots within larger cleared areas. These larger cleared areas were a communal place for naturally growing and useful plants. As the Europeans viewed fences as \"hallmarks of civilization\" they set about transforming \"the land into something more suitable for themselves\".<ref>Mann, Charles. 1493: Uncovering the New World Columbus Created. New York, New York: Vintage Books, 2011. loc. 1094 and 1050</ref> In implementing their practices, the Europeans enslaved, murdered, and exploited indigenous populations. Furthermore, in cases of enslaved peoples (and in particular, enslaved Africans) the Europeans simultaneously implemented their value system while at the same time justifying enslaving people through a philosophy which reduced the enslaved people to property. Thus, the slave traders and some of the plantation owners used the concept of family to exploit and control the enslaved people. In other subtle ways, which had a large impact the cultural exchanges involved sharing practices and traditions. An example of this can be found in the tobacco industry.\n\nTobacco was one of the luxury goods which was spread as a direct result of the Columbian exchange. As is discussed in regard to the trans-Atlantic slave trade, the tobacco trade increased demand for free labor and spread tobacco worldwide. In discussing the widespread uses of tobacco, the Spanish physician Nicolas Monardes (1493\u20131588) noted that \"The black people that have gone from these parts to the Indies, have taken up the same manner and use of tobacco that the Indians have\".<ref>Monardes, Nicholas. \"Of the Tabaco and of his Greate Vertues\". Frampton, John trans, Wolf, Michael, ed. Tobacco.org. Accessed June 1, 2017 http://archive.tobacco.org/History/monardes.html {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120607233337/http://archive.tobacco.org/History/monardes.html|date=June 7, 2012}}</ref> As the European colonizers and enslaved Africans traveled the globe and came into contact with indigenous peoples, they took with them the cultural practices related to tobacco, and spread them to additional regions. Therefore, demand for tobacco grew in the course of the cultural exchanges and increased contacts among peoples.\n\nWhile [[Mapuche]] people did adopt the horse, sheep, and wheat, the over-all scant adoption of Spanish technology by Mapuche has been characterized as mean of [[Resistance through culture|cultural resistance]].<ref name=DilleMaterial2014/>\n\n==== Atlantic slave trade ====\n\n[[File:AfricanSlavesTransport.jpg|thumb|Enslaved Africans were chained and bound before taken on ships to the New World]]\nThe [[Atlantic slave trade]] was the transfer of Africans from primarily West Africa to parts of the Americas between the 16th and 19th century.<ref name=\"Black Rice\">{{cite book |last1=Carney |first1=Judith |title=Black Rice |url=https://archive.org/details/blackriceafrican00carn |url-access=registration |date=2001 |publisher=Harvard University Press |pages=[https://archive.org/details/blackriceafrican00carn/page/2 2\u20138]}}</ref> About 10 million slaves arrived in the Americas from Africa.

The presence of enslaved Africans not only represented skilled labor but it also gave way to a new population which represented a hybrid of the two cultures.<ref name=\"Black Rice\"/> ''The Birth of African American Culture: An Anthropological Perspective'' is a book written by Sidney Mintz and Richard Price further detailing the cultural impact of enslaved Africans in America. Mintz and Price's book helped to publicize how integral the socialization aspects of plantation life were to the structures of black culture.\n\nThe treatment of enslaved Africans during the Atlantic slave trade became one of the most controversial topics in the history of the New World. Since its abolishment in 1865 in the US and its total extinction by 1890 in the rest of the New World, it has remained a key subject in politics, pop culture and media.\n\n==Organism examples==\n{{See also|New World crops|Agriculture in Mesoamerica|Muisca agriculture|List of food origins}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\" width=70%\n|+ Post-Columbian transfers of native organisms with close ties to humans\n!

Some plants introduced intentionally, such as the [[kudzu|kudzu vine]] introduced in 1894 from [[Japan]] to the United States to help control [[soil erosion]], have since been found to be invasive pests in the new environment.\n\nFungi have also been transported, such as the one responsible for [[Dutch elm disease]], killing [[Ulmus americana|American elms]] in North American forests and cities, where many had been planted as street trees.

As the demand in the New World grew, so did the knowledge on how to cultivate it.

Tobacco, potatoes, [[chili peppers]], [[tomatillos]], and tomatoes are all members of the [[nightshade family]]. All of these plants bear some resemblance to the [[European nightshade]] that even an amateur could deduce just by simple observation of the flowers and berries. Similar to some European Nightshade varieties, tomatoes and potatoes can be harmful or even lethal, if the wrong part of the plant is consumed at the wrong quantity. Of all the New World plants introduced to Italy, only the potato took as long as the tomato to gain acceptance.  16th-century physicians, thus, had good reason to be wary that this native Mexican fruit was poisonous and the generator of \"melancholic humours\".  In 1544, [[Pietro Andrea Mattioli]], a [[Grand Duchy of Tuscany|Tuscan]] physician and botanist, suggested that tomatoes might be edible, but no record exists of anyone consuming them at this time. On October 31, 1548, the tomato was given its first name anywhere in Europe when a house steward of [[Cosimo I de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany|Cosimo I de' Medici, Duke of Florence]], wrote to the De' Medici's private secretary that the basket of ''pomi d'oro'' \"had arrived safely\". At this time, the label ''pomi d'oro'' was also used to refer to figs, melons, and citrus fruits in treatises by scientists.<ref name=Gentilcore>''A History of the Tomato in Italy Pomodoro!'', [[David Gentilcore]] (New York, NY: Columbia University Press, 2010).</ref>\n\nIn the early years, tomatoes were mainly grown as ornamentals in Italy. For example, the [[Duchy of Florence|Florentine]] aristocrat [[Giovan Vettorio Soderini]] wrote how they \"were to be sought only for their beauty\" and were grown only in gardens or flower beds. Tomatoes were grown in elite town and country gardens in the fifty years or so following their arrival in Europe and were only occasionally depicted in works of art. However, in 1592 the head gardener at the botanical garden of [[Aranjuez]] near Madrid, under the patronage of [[Philip II of Spain]], wrote, \"it is said [tomatoes] are good for sauces\". Besides this account, tomatoes remained exotic plants grown for ornamental purposes, but rarely for culinary use. The combination of pasta with [[tomato sauce]] was developed only in the late nineteenth century. Today around {{convert|90000|acres|sigfig=2|abbr=on}} of tomatoes are cultivated in Italy, although there are still areas where relatively few tomatoes are grown and consumed.<ref name=Gentilcore/>\n\n===Livestock===\n{{further|Plains Indians#The horse}}\nInitially at least, the Columbian exchange of animals largely went in one direction, from Europe to the New World, as the Eurasian regions had domesticated many more animals.

While Europeans and Asians were affected by the Eurasian diseases, their [[endemic]] status in those continents over centuries resulted in many people gaining [[immunity (medical)|immunity]].\n\nBy contrast, Old World diseases had a devastating effect when introduced via European carriers, as the native people in the Americas had no natural immunity to the new diseases.

For example, in the article \"The Myth of Early Globalization: The Atlantic Economy, 1500\u20131800\" Pieter Emmer makes the point that \"from 1500 onward, a 'clash of cultures' had begun in the Atlantic\".<ref>Emmer, Pieter. \"The Myth of Early Globalization: The Atlantic Economy, 1500\u20131800\". European Review 11, no. 1. Feb. 2003. p. 45\u201346</ref> This clash of culture transferred European values to indigenous cultures. For example, the emergence of private property in regions where there were little to no rights to lands, the concepts of monogamy and the nuclear family, the role of women and children in the family system, and the \"superiority of free labor\".<ref>Emmer, Pieter. \"The Myth of Early Globalization: The Atlantic Economy, 1500\u20131800\". European Review 11, no. 1. Feb. 2003. p. 46</ref> An example of this type of cultural exchange occurred during the 1500s in North America. When these early European colonizers first entered North America, they encountered fence-less lands which indicated to them that this land was unimproved. For these Europeans, they were seeking economic opportunities, therefore, land and resources were important for the success of the mission. When these colonizers entered North America they encountered a fully established culture of people called the [[Powhatan]]. The Powhatan farmers in Virginia scattered their farm plots within larger cleared areas. These larger cleared areas were a communal place for naturally growing and useful plants. As the Europeans viewed fences as \"hallmarks of civilization\" they set about transforming \"the land into something more suitable for themselves\".<ref>Mann, Charles. 1493: Uncovering the New World Columbus Created. New York, New York: Vintage Books, 2011. loc. 1094 and 1050</ref> In implementing their practices, the Europeans enslaved, murdered, and exploited indigenous populations. Furthermore, in cases of enslaved peoples (and in particular, enslaved Africans) the Europeans simultaneously implemented their value system while at the same time justifying enslaving people through a philosophy which reduced the enslaved people to property. Thus, the slave traders and some of the plantation owners used the concept of family to exploit and control the enslaved people. In other subtle ways, which had a large impact the cultural exchanges involved sharing practices and traditions. An example of this can be found in the tobacco industry.\n\nTobacco was one of the luxury goods which was spread as a direct result of the Columbian exchange. As is discussed in regard to the trans-Atlantic slave trade, the tobacco trade increased demand for free labor and spread tobacco worldwide. In discussing the widespread uses of tobacco, the Spanish physician Nicolas Monardes (1493\u20131588) noted that \"The black people that have gone from these parts to the Indies, have taken up the same manner and use of tobacco that the Indians have\".<ref>Monardes, Nicholas. \"Of the Tabaco and of his Greate Vertues\". Frampton, John trans, Wolf, Michael, ed. Tobacco.org.

Therefore, demand for tobacco grew in the course of the cultural exchanges and increased contacts among peoples.\n\nWhile [[Mapuche]] people did adopt the horse, sheep, and wheat, the over-all scant adoption of Spanish technology by Mapuche has been characterized as mean of [[Resistance through culture|cultural resistance]].<ref name=DilleMaterial2014/>\n\n==== Atlantic slave trade ====\n\n[[File:AfricanSlavesTransport.jpg|thumb|Enslaved Africans were chained and bound before taken on ships to the New World]]\nThe [[Atlantic slave trade]] was the transfer of Africans from primarily West Africa to parts of the Americas between the 16th and 19th century.<ref name=\"Black Rice\">{{cite book |last1=Carney |first1=Judith |title=Black Rice |url=https://archive.org/details/blackriceafrican00carn |url-access=registration |date=2001 |publisher=Harvard University Press |pages=[https://archive.org/details/blackriceafrican00carn/page/2 2\u20138]}}</ref> About 10 million slaves arrived in the Americas from Africa.

The presence of enslaved Africans not only represented skilled labor but it also gave way to a new population which represented a hybrid of the two cultures.<ref name=\"Black Rice\"/> ''The Birth of African American Culture: An Anthropological Perspective'' is a book written by Sidney Mintz and Richard Price further detailing the cultural impact of enslaved Africans in America. Mintz and Price's book helped to publicize how integral the socialization aspects of plantation life were to the structures of black culture.\n\nThe treatment of enslaved Africans during the Atlantic slave trade became one of the most controversial topics in the history of the New World. Since its abolishment in 1865 in the US and its total extinction by 1890 in the rest of the New World, it has remained a key subject in politics, pop culture and media.\n\n==Organism examples==\n{{See also|New World crops|Agriculture in Mesoamerica|Muisca agriculture|List of food origins}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\" width=70%\n|+ Post-Columbian transfers of native organisms with close ties to humans\n!

[[Invasive species]] of [[plant]]s and [[pathogen]]s also were introduced by chance, including such weeds as [[Salsola|tumbleweeds]] (''Salsola'' spp.) and [[Avena fatua|wild oats]] (''Avena fatua''). Some plants introduced intentionally, such as the [[kudzu|kudzu vine]] introduced in 1894 from [[Japan]] to the United States to help control [[soil erosion]], have since been found to be invasive pests in the new environment.\n\nFungi have also been transported, such as the one responsible for [[Dutch elm disease]], killing [[Ulmus americana|American elms]] in North American forests and cities, where many had been planted as street trees. Some of the invasive species have become serious ecosystem and economic problems after establishing in the New World environments.<ref>{{cite journal | url=http://www.actionbioscience.org/biodiversity/simberloff.html | title=Introduced Species: The Threat to Biodiversity & What Can Be Done | author=Simberloff, Daniel | journal=American Institute of Biological Sciences: Bringing Biology to Informed Decision Making. | year=2000}}</ref><ref>Fern\u00e1ndez P\u00e9rez, Joaquin and Ignacio Gonz\u00e1lez Tasc\u00f3n (eds.)

In the 1840s, ''[[Phytophthora infestans]]'' crossed the oceans, damaging the potato crop in several European nations. In Ireland, the potato crop was totally destroyed; the [[Great Famine (Ireland)|Irish Potato Famine]] caused millions to starve to death or emigrate.\n\nIn addition to these, many animals were introduced to new habitats on the other side of the world either accidentally or incidentally. These include such animals as [[brown rat]]s, [[earthworm]]s (apparently absent from parts of the pre-Columbian New World), and [[zebra mussel]]s, which arrived on ships.<ref name = \"Hoddle\">{{cite web |first=M.

In the New World, populations of feral European cats, pigs, horses, and cattle are common, and the [[Burmese python]] and [[green iguana]] are considered problematic in Florida. In the Old World, the [[Eastern gray squirrel]] has been particularly successful in colonising [[Great Britain]], and populations of [[raccoon]]s can now be found in some regions of Germany, the Caucasus, and Japan.
