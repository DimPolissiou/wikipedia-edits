Over thousands of years they eventually spread across the whole landmass. These [[Indigenous Australians]] were long established throughout Western Australia by the time European explorers began to arrive in the early 17th century.\n\nThe first European to visit Western Australia was a Dutch explorer, [[Dirk Hartog]], who on 25 October 1616 landed at what is now known as Cape Inscription, [[Dirk Hartog Island]]. For the rest of the 17th century, other Dutch and British navigators encountered the coast, usually unintentionally, as demonstrated by the many shipwrecks along the coast of ships that deviated from the [[Brouwer Route]] (because of poor navigation and storms).<ref>{{cite journal |last=Green |first=J.N. |date=1977 |title=Australia's oldest wreck: The Loss of the Trial, 1622 |url=http://museum.wa.gov.au/maritime-archaeology-db/sites/default/files/no._278_trial_bar_1977_0.pdf |journal=British Archaeological Reports, Supplementary Series 27 |location=Oxford}}</ref> Two hundred years passed before Europeans believed that the great southern continent actually existed. By the late 18th century, British and French sailors had begun to explore the Western Australian coast.\n\nThe origins of the present state began with the establishment by Lockyer<ref name=\"Western Australia Foundation\"/> of a convict-supported settlement from [[New South Wales]] at [[King George Sound|King George III Sound]]. The settlement was formally annexed on 21 January 1827 by Lockyer when he commanded the [[Union Jack]] be raised and a [[feu de joie]] fired by the troops. The settlement was founded in response to British concerns about the possibility of a French colony being established on the coast of Western Australia.<ref name=\"Western Australia Foundation\"/> On 7 March 1831 it was transferred to the control of the Swan River Colony,<ref name=knibbs/> and named [[Albany, Western Australia|Albany]] in 1832.\n\nIn 1829 the [[Swan River Colony]] was established on the Swan River by Captain [[James Stirling (Australian governor)|James Stirling]]. By 1832, the British settler population of the colony had reached around 1,500, and the official name of the colony was changed to Western Australia. The two separate townsites of the colony developed slowly into the port city of [[Fremantle]] and the state's capital, Perth. [[York, Western Australia|York]] was the first inland settlement in Western Australia, situated {{convert|97|km}} east of Perth and settled on 16 September 1831. York was the staging point for early explorers who discovered the rich gold reserves of Kalgoorlie.\n\nPopulation growth was very slow until significant discoveries of gold were made in the 1890s around [[Kalgoorlie]].\n\nIn 1887, a new constitution was drafted, providing for the right of self-governance of European Australians and in 1890, the act granting [[self-governing colony|self-government]] to the colony was passed by the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|British Parliament]]. [[John Forrest]] became the first [[Premier of Western Australia]].\n\nIn 1896, the [[Western Australian Parliament]] authorised the raising of a loan to construct a [[Pipeline transport|pipeline]] to transport {{convert|5|e6impgal|ML|order=flip|abbr=off}} of water per day to the Goldfields of Western Australia. The pipeline, known as the [[Goldfields Water Supply Scheme]], was completed in 1903. [[C.Y. O'Connor]], Western Australia's first engineer-in-chief, designed and oversaw the construction of the pipeline. It carries water {{convert|530|km|mi|abbr=on}} from Perth to [[Kalgoorlie]], and is attributed by historians as an important factor driving the state's population and economic growth.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.adb.online.anu.edu.au/biogs/A110059b.htm |title=''O'Connor, Charles Yelverton (1843\u20131902)'' |author=Tauman, Merab Harris  |publisher=[[Melbourne University Press|MUP]] |year=1988 |pages=51\u201354 |accessdate=12 July 2008}}</ref>\n\nFollowing a campaign led by Forrest, residents of the colony of Western Australia (still informally called the Swan River Colony) voted in favour of [[Federation of Australia|federation]], resulting in Western Australia officially becoming a state on 1 January 1901.\n\n==Geography==\n{{Main|Geography of Western Australia}}\nWestern Australia is bounded to the east by longitude 129\u00b0E, the meridian 129 degrees east of Greenwich, which defines the border with South Australia and the [[Northern Territory]], and bounded by the Indian Ocean to the west and north.

Most of the state is a low plateau with an average elevation of about 400 metres (1,200&nbsp;ft), very low relief, and no [[surface runoff]].

Even soils derived from [[granite|granitic]] [[bedrock]] contain an order of magnitude less available [[phosphorus]] and only half as much [[nitrogen]] as soils in comparable climates in other continents. Soils derived from extensive sandplains or [[ironstone]] are even less fertile, nearly devoid of soluble phosphate and deficient in [[zinc]], copper, [[molybdenum]] and sometimes [[potassium]] and [[calcium]].\n\nThe infertility of most of the soils has required heavy application by farmers of fertilisers. These have resulted in damage to [[invertebrate]] and bacterial populations.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}} The grazing and use of hoofed mammals and, later, heavy machinery through the years have resulted in [[soil compaction|compaction of soils]] and great damage to the fragile soils.\n\nLarge-scale land clearing for agriculture has damaged habitats for native flora and fauna. As a result, the [[Southwest Australia|South West region]] of the state has a higher concentration of rare, threatened or endangered flora and fauna than many areas of Australia, making it one of the world's biodiversity \"hot spots\".

In the 1890s, interstate immigration, resulting from a mining boom in the [[Goldfields-Esperance|Goldfields region]], resulted in a sharp population increase.\n\nWestern Australia did not receive significant flows of [[Immigration to Australia|immigrants]] from Britain, Ireland or elsewhere in the [[British Empire]] until the early 20th century. At that time, its local projects\u2014such as the [[Group Settlement Scheme]] of the 1920s, which encouraged farmers to settle the southwest\u2014increased awareness of Australia's western third as a destination for colonists.\n\nLed by immigrants from the British Isles, Western Australia's population developed at a faster rate during the twentieth century than it had previously. After [[World War II]], both the eastern states and Western Australia received large numbers of [[Italian Australian|Italians]], [[Croatian Australian|Croatians]] and [[Macedonian Australians|Macedonians]]. Despite this, Britain has contributed the greatest number of immigrants to this day. Western Australia\u2014particularly Perth\u2014has the highest proportion of British-born of any state: 10.3% in 2011, compared to a national average of 5.1%.

Over thousands of years they eventually spread across the whole landmass. These [[Indigenous Australians]] were long established throughout Western Australia by the time European explorers began to arrive in the early 17th century.\n\nThe first European to visit Western Australia was a Dutch explorer, [[Dirk Hartog]], who on 25 October 1616 landed at what is now known as Cape Inscription, [[Dirk Hartog Island]]. For the rest of the 17th century, other Dutch and British navigators encountered the coast, usually unintentionally, as demonstrated by the many shipwrecks along the coast of ships that deviated from the [[Brouwer Route]] (because of poor navigation and storms).<ref>{{cite journal |last=Green |first=J.N. |date=1977 |title=Australia's oldest wreck: The Loss of the Trial, 1622 |url=http://museum.wa.gov.au/maritime-archaeology-db/sites/default/files/no._278_trial_bar_1977_0.pdf |journal=British Archaeological Reports, Supplementary Series 27 |location=Oxford}}</ref> Two hundred years passed before Europeans believed that the great southern continent actually existed. By the late 18th century, British and French sailors had begun to explore the Western Australian coast.\n\nThe origins of the present state began with the establishment by Lockyer<ref name=\"Western Australia Foundation\"/> of a convict-supported settlement from [[New South Wales]] at [[King George Sound|King George III Sound]]. The settlement was formally annexed on 21 January 1827 by Lockyer when he commanded the [[Union Jack]] be raised and a [[feu de joie]] fired by the troops. The settlement was founded in response to British concerns about the possibility of a French colony being established on the coast of Western Australia.<ref name=\"Western Australia Foundation\"/> On 7 March 1831 it was transferred to the control of the Swan River Colony,<ref name=knibbs/> and named [[Albany, Western Australia|Albany]] in 1832.\n\nIn 1829 the [[Swan River Colony]] was established on the Swan River by Captain [[James Stirling (Australian governor)|James Stirling]]. By 1832, the British settler population of the colony had reached around 1,500, and the official name of the colony was changed to Western Australia. The two separate townsites of the colony developed slowly into the port city of [[Fremantle]] and the state's capital, Perth. [[York, Western Australia|York]] was the first inland settlement in Western Australia, situated {{convert|97|km}} east of Perth and settled on 16 September 1831. York was the staging point for early explorers who discovered the rich gold reserves of Kalgoorlie.\n\nPopulation growth was very slow until significant discoveries of gold were made in the 1890s around [[Kalgoorlie]].\n\nIn 1887, a new constitution was drafted, providing for the right of self-governance of European Australians and in 1890, the act granting [[self-governing colony|self-government]] to the colony was passed by the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|British Parliament]]. [[John Forrest]] became the first [[Premier of Western Australia]].\n\nIn 1896, the [[Western Australian Parliament]] authorised the raising of a loan to construct a [[Pipeline transport|pipeline]] to transport {{convert|5|e6impgal|ML|order=flip|abbr=off}} of water per day to the Goldfields of Western Australia. The pipeline, known as the [[Goldfields Water Supply Scheme]], was completed in 1903. [[C.Y. O'Connor]], Western Australia's first engineer-in-chief, designed and oversaw the construction of the pipeline. It carries water {{convert|530|km|mi|abbr=on}} from Perth to [[Kalgoorlie]], and is attributed by historians as an important factor driving the state's population and economic growth.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.adb.online.anu.edu.au/biogs/A110059b.htm |title=''O'Connor, Charles Yelverton (1843\u20131902)'' |author=Tauman, Merab Harris  |publisher=[[Melbourne University Press|MUP]] |year=1988 |pages=51\u201354 |accessdate=12 July 2008}}</ref>\n\nFollowing a campaign led by Forrest, residents of the colony of Western Australia (still informally called the Swan River Colony) voted in favour of [[Federation of Australia|federation]], resulting in Western Australia officially becoming a state on 1 January 1901.\n\n==Geography==\n{{Main|Geography of Western Australia}}\nWestern Australia is bounded to the east by longitude 129\u00b0E, the meridian 129 degrees east of Greenwich, which defines the border with South Australia and the [[Northern Territory]], and bounded by the Indian Ocean to the west and north.

Soils derived from extensive sandplains or [[ironstone]] are even less fertile, nearly devoid of soluble phosphate and deficient in [[zinc]], copper, [[molybdenum]] and sometimes [[potassium]] and [[calcium]].\n\nThe infertility of most of the soils has required heavy application by farmers of fertilisers. These have resulted in damage to [[invertebrate]] and bacterial populations.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}} The grazing and use of hoofed mammals and, later, heavy machinery through the years have resulted in [[soil compaction|compaction of soils]] and great damage to the fragile soils.\n\nLarge-scale land clearing for agriculture has damaged habitats for native flora and fauna.

As an important advocate of [[British Israelism|Anglo Israelism]] (also known as British Israelism), he associated religious beliefs with ultra-conservative and radical political activism.\n\n== Life ==\nSawyer was originally pastor of the East Side Christian Church in [[Portland (Oregon)|Portland, Oregon]], where until the beginning of the 1920s he built up a strong grouping of Anglo-Israelites with the Anglo-Israel Research Society. He took a leading role in the establishment of the [[British-Israel-World Federation|British-Israel-World Federation]] in London in 1919. Sawyer was in demand as a speaker and in 1921 gave up his pastorate to dedicate himself exclusively to his lectures on the Pacific coast and western Canada, especially in Vancouver.<ref name=\"Balmer\">{{cite book\n|last=Balmer\n|first=Randall \n|title=Encyclopedia of Evangelicalism\n|journal=The Expository Times \n|volume=114 \n|issue=3 \n|year=2002\n|publisher=John Knox Press\n|location=Louisville, KY\n|isbn=978-0664224097\n|page=654|doi=10.1177/001452460211400310 \n}}</ref>\n\nIn addition to his commitment to the Anglo-Israelite movement, Sawyer participated in the construction of the Oregon [[Ku Klux Klan]] of which he was leader from 1921 to 1924.<ref name=\"Bernadini\">{{cite book\n|last1=Bernardini\n|first1=Paolo\n|last2=Fiering\n|first2=Norman\n|title=The Jews and the Expansion of Europe to the West, 1450 to 1800\n|url=https://www.google.co.uk/search?tbo=p&tbm=bks&q=isbn:1571811532\n|accessdate=25 April 2017\n|year=2001\n|publisher=Berghahn Books\n|isbn=9781571811530}}</ref> Sawyer's participation was mainly as a speaker whose appearances sometimes addressed audiences of several thousand. In 1922 he also took on the leadership of the Women's Organization of the Invisible Empire, founded by the leader of the Klan in Oregon, Fred Gifford. In 1924 he fell out with Gifford and left the Klan.<ref name=\"Balmer\" />\n\nSawyer was of the opinion that one could distinguish between the true Israelites, from whom the Anglo-Saxons were descended, and \"false\" Jews. Under the influence of the publication of the series of articles ''[[The International Jew]]'', in the ''[[Dearborn Independent]]'', a weekly newspaper published by [[Henry Ford]], Sawyer began to identify the \"false\" Jews with un-American objectives and [[Bolshevism]].

Like both African species, it has two horns; the larger is the nasal horn, typically {{convert|15|-|25|cm|in|abbr=on}}, while the other horn is typically a stub.

No evidence indicates Sumatran rhinos defend their territories through fighting. [[territorial marking|Marking their territories]] is done by scraping soil with their feet, bending saplings into distinctive patterns, and leaving excrement. The Sumatran rhino is usually most active when eating, at dawn, and just after dusk. During the day, they [[Wallowing in animals|wallow]] in mud baths to cool down and rest. In the [[rainy season]], they move to higher elevations; in the cooler months, they return to lower areas in their range.<ref name=\"van Strien\"/> When mud holes are unavailable, the rhino will deepen puddles with its feet and horns. The wallowing behaviour helps the rhino maintain its body temperature and protect its skin from [[ectoparasite]]s and other insects. Captive specimens, deprived of adequate wallowing, have quickly developed broken and inflamed skins, [[suppuration]]s, eye problems, inflamed nails, and hair loss, and have eventually died. One 20-month study of wallowing behavior found they will visit no more than three wallows at any given time. After two to 12 weeks using a particular wallow, the rhino will abandon it. Typically, the rhino will wallow around midday for two to three hours at a time before venturing out for food. Although in zoos the Sumatran rhino has been observed wallowing less than 45 minutes a day, the study of wild animals found 80\u2013300 minutes (an average of 166 minutes) per day spent in wallows.<ref name=Wallows>{{cite journal| title = Wallows and Wallow Utilization of the Sumatran Rhinoceros (''Dicerorhinus Sumatrensis'') in a Natural Enclosure in Sungai Dusun Wildlife Reserve, Selangor, Malaysia | year = 2001 | journal = Journal of Wildlife and Parks | volume = 19 | pages = 7\u201312 | last = Julia Ng | first = S.C. |author2=Z.

The eep, a short, one-second-long yelp, is the most common sound. The whale, named for its similarity to [[Whale sound|vocalizations]] of the [[humpback whale]], is the most song-like vocalization and the second-most common. The whale varies in pitch and lasts from four to seven seconds. The whistle-blow is named because it consists of a two-second-long whistling noise and a burst of air in immediate succession. The whistle-blow is the loudest of the vocalizations, loud enough to make the iron bars in the zoo enclosure where the rhinos were studied vibrate. The purpose of the vocalizations is unknown, though they are theorized to convey danger, sexual readiness, and location, as do other ungulate vocalizations. The whistle-blow could be heard at a great distance, even in the dense brush in which the Sumatran rhino lives. A vocalization of similar volume from [[elephant]]s has been shown to carry {{convert|9.8|km|mi|abbr=on}} and the whistle-blow may carry as far.<ref name=Acoustical>{{cite journal| journal = Acoustics Research Letters Online | doi = 10.1121/1.1588271 | year = 2003 | title = Songlike vocalizations from the Sumatran Rhinoceros (''Dicerorhinus sumatrensis'') |url=http://www.rhinoresourcecenter.com/pdf_files/117/1175856669.pdf| author1=von Muggenthaler, Elizabeth |author2=Paul Reinhart |author3=Brad Limpany |author4=R.

The [[gestation period]] is around 15\u201316 months. The calf, which typically weighs {{convert|40|\u2013|60|kg|lb|abbr=on}}, is weaned after about 15 months and stays with its mother for the first two to three years of its life. In the wild, the birth interval for this species is estimated to be four to five years; its natural offspring-rearing behavior is unstudied.<ref name=\"van Strien\"/>\n\nThe reproductive habits of the Sumatran rhinoceros have been studied in captivity. Sexual relationships begin with a courtship period characterized by increased vocalization, tail raising, [[urination]], and increased physical contact, with both male and female using their snouts to bump the other in the head and genitals. The pattern of courtship is most similar to that of the [[black rhinoceros]]. Young Sumatran rhino males are often too aggressive with females, sometimes injuring and even killing them during the courtship. In the wild, the female could run away from an overly aggressive male, but in their smaller captive enclosures, they cannot; this inability to escape aggressive males may partly contribute to the low success rate of captive-breeding programs.<ref name=ZZ2005>{{cite journal |last1=Zainal Zahari |first1=Z. |last2=Rosnina |first2=Y. |last3=Wahid |first3=H. |last4=Yap |first4=K.

In Burma, the belief was once widespread that the Sumatran rhino ate fire. Tales described the fire-eating rhino following smoke to its source, especially campfires, and then attacking the camp. There was also a Burmese belief that the best time to hunt was every July, when the Sumatran rhinos would congregate beneath the full moon. In Malaya, it was said that the rhino's horn was hollow and could be used as a sort of hose for breathing air and squirting water. In Malaya and Sumatra, it was once believed that the rhino shed its horn every year and buried it under the ground. In Borneo, the rhino was said to have a strange carnivorous practice: after defecating in a stream, it would turn around and eat fish that had been stupefied by the excrement.<ref name=LitStud/>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|35em}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Wikispecies|Dicerorhinus sumatrensis}}\n{{Commons|Dicerorhinus sumatrensis}}\n{{Portal|Indonesia|Mammals}}\n*[http://www.rhinoresourcecenter.com/species/sumatran-rhino/ Sumatran Rhino Info] & [http://www.rhinoresourcecenter.com/index.php?s=1&act=imgs&CODE=tax_images&taxon=8 Sumatran Rhino Pictures] on the [http://www.rhinoresourcecenter.com Rhino Resource Center]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20071111180859/http://www.arkive.org/species/GES/mammals/Dicerorhinus_sumatrensis/ Sumatran Rhino] at [[Arkive]].\n*[http://www.rhinoandforestfund.org Rhino and Forest Fund]\n*[http://www.borneorhinoalliance.org Borneo Rhino Alliance]\n*[http://www.michielhegener.nl/maps/Sumatraanse-neushoorn-def.pdf distribution map 2017]\n*[https://savesumatranrhinos.org/#reverseDecline Map by The National Geographic, 2018]\n\n{{Perissodactyla}}\n\n{{featured article}}\n{{Taxonbar|from=Q29220}}\n{{authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Rhinoceroses]]\n[[Category:Mammals of Southeast Asia|Rhinoceros, Sumatran]]\n[[Category:Fauna of Sumatra|Rhinoceros, Sumatran]]\n[[Category:Mammals of Borneo|Rhinoceros, Sumatran]]\n[[Category:Mammals of India|Rhinoceros, Sumatran]]\n[[Category:Mammals of Indonesia|Rhinoceros, Sumatran]]\n[[Category:Mammals of Malaysia|Rhinoceros, Sumatran]]\n[[Category:Mammals described in 1814]]\n[[Category:Critically endangered fauna of Asia]]\n[[Category:EDGE species|Rhinoceros, Sumatran]]\n[[Category:Miocene mammals]]\n[[Category:Extant Miocene first appearances]]\n", "text_old": "{{Redirect|Hairy rhinoceros|the extinct megafauna|woolly rhinoceros}}\n{{pp-move-indef}}\n{{short description|Endangered species of small Asian rhinoceros}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date = November 2019}}\n{{Speciesbox\n| name = Sumatran rhinoceros<ref name=MSW3>{{MSW3 Perissodactyla |id=14100054 |page=635}}</ref>\n| fossil_range = {{Fossilrange|Early Pleistocene|Recent}}\n| image = Sumatran Rhinoceros at Sumatran Rhino Sanctuary Lampung Indonesia 2013.JPG\n| image_caption = Sumatran rhinoceros at Sumatran Rhino Sanctuary in Lampung, Indonesia\n| status = CR\n| status_system = IUCN3.1\n| status_ref = <ref name=IUCN/>\n| status2 = CITES_A1\n| status2_system = CITES\n| status2_ref = <ref>''[https://cites.org/eng/node/21233 Dicerorhinus sumatrensis]'' Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species</ref>\n| genus = Dicerorhinus\n| species = sumatrensis\n| authority = ([[Johann Fischer von Waldheim|Fischer]], 1814)<ref name=Taxhistory/>\n<imagemap>\nimage:Sumatran Rhinoceros Range.svg.png|250px|Sumatran rhino range \ncircle 320 510 12 [[Taman Negara National Park]]\ncircle 595 505 12 [[Tabin Wildlife Reserve]]\ncircle 250 550 12 [[Gunung Leuser National Park]]\ncircle 315 660 12 [[Kerinci Seblat National Park]]\ncircle 355 712 12 [[Bukit Barisan Selatan National Park]]\ncircle 375 700 12 [[Way Kambas National Park]]\n\ndesc none\n</imagemap>\n<center><small>\nSumatran rhinoceros range (excluding population in [[East Kalimantan]]) <ref>Derived from range maps in:\n* {{cite book | last = Foose | first = Thomas J. and [[van Strien, Nico]] | year = 1997 | title = Asian Rhinos \u2013 Status Survey and Conservation Action Plan | publisher = [[IUCN]], Gland, Switzerland, and Cambridge, UK | isbn = 2-8317-0336-0}}<br>and\n* {{cite book | title = The Return of the Unicorns; The Natural History and Conservation of the Greater One-Horned Rhinoceros | last = Dinerstein | first = Eric | publisher = [[Columbia University Press]] | location = [[New York City|New York]] | year = 2003 | isbn = 0-231-08450-1 }}<br>This map does not include unconfirmed historical sightings in Laos and Vietnam or possible remaining populations in Burma.</ref></small></center>\n| subdivision_ranks = Subspecies\n| subdivision = *''[[D. s. harrissoni]]'' <small>Groves, 1965</small>\n*''D. s. sumatrensis'' <small>Fischer, 1814</small>\n*''D. s. lasiotis'' <small>Buckland, 1872</small>\n}}\n\nThe '''Sumatran rhinoceros''', also known as the '''hairy rhinoceros''' or '''Asian two-horned rhinoceros''' (''Dicerorhinus sumatrensis''), is a rare member of the family [[Rhinocerotidae]] and one of five extant species of [[rhinoceros]]. It is the only [[Extant taxon|extant]] species of the [[genus]] '''''Dicerorhinus'''''. It is the smallest rhinoceros, although it is still a large mammal; it stands {{convert|112|-|145|cm|ft|abbr=on}} high at the shoulder, with a head-and-body length of {{convert|2.36|-|3.18|m|ft|abbr=on}} and a tail of {{convert|35|-|70|cm|in|abbr=on}}. The weight is reported to range from {{convert|500|to|1000|kg|lb|-1|abbr=on}}, averaging {{convert|700|-|800|kg|lb|-1|abbr=on}}, although there is a single record of a {{convert|2000|kg|lb|-1|abbr=on}} specimen. Like both African species, it has two horns; the larger is the nasal horn, typically {{convert|15|-|25|cm|in|abbr=on}}, while the other horn is typically a stub. A coat of reddish-brown hair covers most of the Sumatran rhino's body.\n\nMembers of the species once inhabited [[rainforests]], [[swamp]]s, and [[cloud forest]]s in India, Bhutan, Bangladesh, Myanmar, Laos, Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia, and China.

It is the most vocal rhino species and also communicates through marking [[soil]] with its feet, twisting [[sapling]]s into patterns, and leaving excrement. The species is much better studied than the similarly reclusive [[Javan rhinoceros]], in part because of a program that brought 40 Sumatran rhinos into captivity with the goal of preserving the species. There was little or no information about procedures that would assist in ''ex situ'' breeding.

No evidence indicates Sumatran rhinos defend their territories through fighting.

The Sumatran rhino is usually most active when eating, at dawn, and just after dusk. During the day, they [[Wallowing in animals|wallow]] in mud baths to cool down and rest. In the [[rainy season]], they move to higher elevations; in the cooler months, they return to lower areas in their range.<ref name=\"van Strien\"/> When mud holes are unavailable, the rhino will deepen puddles with its feet and horns. The wallowing behaviour helps the rhino maintain its body temperature and protect its skin from [[ectoparasite]]s and other insects. Captive specimens, deprived of adequate wallowing, have quickly developed broken and inflamed skins, [[suppuration]]s, eye problems, inflamed nails, and hair loss, and have eventually died. One 20-month study of wallowing behavior found they will visit no more than three wallows at any given time. After two to 12 weeks using a particular wallow, the rhino will abandon it. Typically, the rhino will wallow around midday for two to three hours at a time before venturing out for food. Although in zoos the Sumatran rhino has been observed wallowing less than 45 minutes a day, the study of wild animals found 80\u2013300 minutes (an average of 166 minutes) per day spent in wallows.<ref name=Wallows>{{cite journal| title = Wallows and Wallow Utilization of the Sumatran Rhinoceros (''Dicerorhinus Sumatrensis'') in a Natural Enclosure in Sungai Dusun Wildlife Reserve, Selangor, Malaysia | year = 2001 | journal = Journal of Wildlife and Parks | volume = 19 | pages = 7\u201312 | last = Julia Ng | first = S.C. |author2=Z.

[[Tiger]]s and wild [[dog]]s may be capable of killing a calf, but calves stay close to their mothers, and the frequency of such killings is unknown. Although the rhino's range overlaps with [[Asian Elephant|elephants]] and [[Malayan Tapir|tapirs]], the species do not appear to compete for food or habitat.

These trails fall into two types. Main trails will be used by generations of rhinos to travel between important areas in the rhino's range, such as between [[salt lick]]s, or in [[Wildlife corridor|corridors]] through inhospitable terrain that separates ranges. In feeding areas, the rhinos will make smaller trails, still covered by vegetation, to areas containing food the rhino eats. Sumatran rhino trails have been found that cross rivers deeper than {{convert|1.5|m|ft|abbr=on}} and about {{convert|50|m|ft|abbr=on}} across. The currents of these rivers are known to be strong, but the rhino is a strong swimmer.<ref name=Groves1972/><ref name=LitStud/> A relative absence of wallows near rivers in the range of the Sumatran rhinoceros indicates they may occasionally bathe in rivers in lieu of wallowing.<ref name=Borner/>\n\n=== Diet ===\n{| class=\"infobox\" style=\"float:right; clear:right; margin-left:1em; margin-right:0; font-size:90%; width:150px;\"\n|-\n|[[File:MallotesPhilipensis.jpg|100x100px]]\n|[[File:Garcinia mangostana fruit1.jpg|100x100px]]\n|-\n|[[File:Eugenia1.jpg|100x100px]]\n|[[File:Ardisia crenata6.jpg|100x100px]]\n|-\n| colspan=\"2\" style=\"width:150px;\"|Clockwise from top left: ''[[Mallotus philippensis|Mallotus]]'', [[mangosteen]]s, ''[[Ardisia]]'', and ''[[Eugenia]]''.<ref name=Borner/><ref name=Biotropica/>\n|}\nMost feeding occurs just before nightfall and in the morning.

The whale, named for its similarity to [[Whale sound|vocalizations]] of the [[humpback whale]], is the most song-like vocalization and the second-most common. The whale varies in pitch and lasts from four to seven seconds. The whistle-blow is named because it consists of a two-second-long whistling noise and a burst of air in immediate succession. The whistle-blow is the loudest of the vocalizations, loud enough to make the iron bars in the zoo enclosure where the rhinos were studied vibrate. The purpose of the vocalizations is unknown, though they are theorized to convey danger, sexual readiness, and location, as do other ungulate vocalizations. The whistle-blow could be heard at a great distance, even in the dense brush in which the Sumatran rhino lives.

Sexual relationships begin with a courtship period characterized by increased vocalization, tail raising, [[urination]], and increased physical contact, with both male and female using their snouts to bump the other in the head and genitals. The pattern of courtship is most similar to that of the [[black rhinoceros]]. Young Sumatran rhino males are often too aggressive with females, sometimes injuring and even killing them during the courtship. In the wild, the female could run away from an overly aggressive male, but in their smaller captive enclosures, they cannot; this inability to escape aggressive males may partly contribute to the low success rate of captive-breeding programs.<ref name=ZZ2005>{{cite journal |last1=Zainal Zahari |first1=Z. |last2=Rosnina |first2=Y. |last3=Wahid |first3=H. |last4=Yap |first4=K.

Extensive footage can be found in an Asia Geographic documentary ''The Littlest Rhino''.

In Burma, the belief was once widespread that the Sumatran rhino ate fire. Tales described the fire-eating rhino following smoke to its source, especially campfires, and then attacking the camp. There was also a Burmese belief that the best time to hunt was every July, when the Sumatran rhinos would congregate beneath the full moon. In Malaya, it was said that the rhino's horn was hollow and could be used as a sort of hose for breathing air and squirting water. In Malaya and Sumatra, it was once believed that the rhino shed its horn every year and buried it under the ground. In Borneo, the rhino was said to have a strange carnivorous practice: after defecating in a stream, it would turn around and eat fish that had been stupefied by the excrement.<ref name=LitStud/>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|35em}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Wikispecies|Dicerorhinus sumatrensis}}\n{{Commons|Dicerorhinus sumatrensis}}\n{{Portal|Indonesia|Mammals}}\n*[http://www.rhinoresourcecenter.com/species/sumatran-rhino/ Sumatran Rhino Info] & [http://www.rhinoresourcecenter.com/index.php?s=1&act=imgs&CODE=tax_images&taxon=8 Sumatran Rhino Pictures] on the [http://www.rhinoresourcecenter.com Rhino Resource Center]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20071111180859/http://www.arkive.org/species/GES/mammals/Dicerorhinus_sumatrensis/ Sumatran Rhino] at [[Arkive]].\n*[http://www.rhinoandforestfund.org Rhino and Forest Fund]\n*[http://www.borneorhinoalliance.org Borneo Rhino Alliance]\n*[http://www.michielhegener.nl/maps/Sumatraanse-neushoorn-def.pdf distribution map 2017]\n*[https://savesumatranrhinos.org/#reverseDecline Map by The National Geographic, 2018]\n\n{{Perissodactyla}}\n\n{{featured article}}\n{{Taxonbar|from=Q29220}}\n{{authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Rhinoceroses]]\n[[Category:Mammals of Southeast Asia|Rhinoceros, Sumatran]]\n[[Category:Fauna of Sumatra|Rhinoceros, Sumatran]]\n[[Category:Mammals of Borneo|Rhinoceros, Sumatran]]\n[[Category:Mammals of India|Rhinoceros, Sumatran]]\n[[Category:Mammals of Indonesia|Rhinoceros, Sumatran]]\n[[Category:Mammals of Malaysia|Rhinoceros, Sumatran]]\n[[Category:Mammals described in 1814]]\n[[Category:Critically endangered fauna of Asia]]\n[[Category:EDGE species|Rhinoceros, Sumatran]]\n[[Category:Miocene mammals]]\n[[Category:Extant Miocene first appearances]]\n", "name_user": "Hemiauchenia", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eEvolution", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sumatran_rhinoceros"}

Several complaints have been made against him to the [[Canadian Broadcast Standards Council]] (CBSC). In a 1994 complaint to the CBSC, listeners alleged that Green had been rude and abusive to a caller who identified herself as a Christian. Although the CBSC determined that Green's conduct had contravened its guidelines on discrimination, it also decided that the station had responded appropriately, and the group did not prescribe any further action. In 2006 and 2008, the council censured Green for his treatment of a Muslim man who challenged Green on the way the radio show host portrays Islam.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cbsc.ca/english/decisions/2009/090206a.php|title=Archived copy|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101121203806/http://www.cbsc.ca/english/decisions/2009/090206a.php|archivedate=21 November 2010|accessdate=2010-11-30|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cbsc.ca/english/decisions/2006/061215.php|title=Archived copy|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111008202250/http://www.cbsc.ca/english/decisions/2006/061215.php|archivedate=8 October 2011|accessdate=2009-08-07|df=dmy-all}}</ref>  In June 2017, there was controversy as to whether [[Indigo Books and Music]] had pulled Green's latest book, ''Amazing But True!'', from its bookshelves in stores in Canada.<ref>{{cite news|last=Johnston|first=Geoffrey|url=http://www.thewhig.com/2017/06/01/author-battles-censorship|title=Author battles 'censorship'|date=1 June 2017|newspaper=The Kingston Whig-Standard|accessdate=12 July 2017}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[https://omny.fm/shows/580-cfra/listen-now-lowell-green-signs-off-for-the-last-tim Lowell Green's final message on CFRA]\n*[https://ottawa.ctvnews.ca/video?clipId=781131 CTV Ottawa on Lowell Green's retirement]\n*[https://www.facebook.com/lgreen.ca/ Lowell Green at Facebook]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20101121203806/http://www.cbsc.ca/english/decisions/2009/090206a.php CBSC 2008 decision]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20111008202250/http://www.cbsc.ca/english/decisions/2006/061215.php CBSC 2006 decision]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20090212100107/http://cbsc.ca/english/decisions/1994/940604.php CBSC 1994 decision]\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Green, Lowell}}\n[[Category:1936 births]]\n[[Category:Canadian non-fiction writers]]\n[[Category:Canadian people of Irish descent]]\n[[Category:Canadian talk radio hosts]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:McGill University alumni]]\n[[Category:Ontario Liberal Party candidates in Ontario provincial elections]]\n[[Category:Writers from Ann Arbor, Michigan]]\n[[Category:Writers from Ottawa]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Canadian radio personality}}\n{{Use Canadian English|date=February 2013}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=July 2013}}\n{{Infobox presenter\n|name        = Lowell Green\n|alias       = \n|image       = Lowell Green.jpg|<nowiki>Lowell Green]]</nowiki>\n|image_size  = \n|caption     = \n|birth_name  = \n|birth_date  = {{Birth date and age|df=yes|1936|07|07}}\n|birth_place = [[Ann Arbor, Michigan]], [[USA]]\n|death_date  = \n|death_place = \n|show        = ''The Lowell Green Show''\n|station     = [[CFRA (AM)|CFRA]] Ottawa\n|timeslot    = Weekdays 10 am to 12pm\n|show2       = \n|station2    = \n|timeslot2   = \n|style       = [[Talk radio]]\n|country     = Canada\n|prevshow    = Greenline\n|website     = \n|spouse      = Deborah Green\n|awards      = }}\n\n'''Lowell Green''' (born 7 July 1936) is a Canadian radio personality, journalist, and author, best known as the host of ''The Lowell Green Show'', a conservative morning [[talk show]] that aired on the [[Ottawa]] [[Ontario]] radio station [[CFRA]].

Although the CBSC determined that Green's conduct had contravened its guidelines on discrimination, it also decided that the station had responded appropriately, and the group did not prescribe any further action. In 2006 and 2008, the council censured Green for his treatment of a Muslim man who challenged Green on the way the radio show host portrays Islam.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cbsc.ca/english/decisions/2009/090206a.php|title=Archived copy|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101121203806/http://www.cbsc.ca/english/decisions/2009/090206a.php|archivedate=21 November 2010|accessdate=2010-11-30|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cbsc.ca/english/decisions/2006/061215.php|title=Archived copy|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111008202250/http://www.cbsc.ca/english/decisions/2006/061215.php|archivedate=8 October 2011|accessdate=2009-08-07|df=dmy-all}}</ref>  In June 2017, there was controversy as to whether [[Indigo Books and Music]] had pulled Green's latest book, ''Amazing But True!'', from its bookshelves in stores in Canada.<ref>{{cite news|last=Johnston|first=Geoffrey|url=http://www.thewhig.com/2017/06/01/author-battles-censorship|title=Author battles 'censorship'|date=1 June 2017|newspaper=The Kingston Whig-Standard|accessdate=12 July 2017}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[https://omny.fm/shows/580-cfra/listen-now-lowell-green-signs-off-for-the-last-tim Lowell Green's final message on CFRA]\n*[https://ottawa.ctvnews.ca/video?clipId=781131 CTV Ottawa on Lowell Green's retirement]\n*[https://www.facebook.com/lgreen.ca/ Lowell Green at Facebook]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20090212100107/http://cbsc.ca/english/decisions/1994/940604.php 1994 decision]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20111008202250/http://www.cbsc.ca/english/decisions/2006/061215.php 2006 decision]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20101121203806/http://www.cbsc.ca/english/decisions/2009/090206a.php 2009 decision]\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Green, Lowell}}\n[[Category:1936 births]]\n[[Category:Canadian non-fiction writers]]\n[[Category:Canadian people of Irish descent]]\n[[Category:Canadian talk radio hosts]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:McGill University alumni]]\n[[Category:Ontario Liberal Party candidates in Ontario provincial elections]]\n[[Category:Writers from Ann Arbor, Michigan]]\n[[Category:Writers from Ottawa]]\n", "name_user": "WildStar", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eExternal links", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lowell_Green"}

In 1778, France signed a [[Treaty of Alliance (1778)|treaty of friendship]] with the United States. Great Britain was then at war with France, and in 1779 it was also at war with Spain.{{sfn|Ayling|1972|pp=275\u2013276}} As a consequence, Great Britain was forced to divert resources used to fight the war in North America to [[theatre (warfare)|theatre]]s in [[Europe]], [[India]] and the [[West Indies]], and to rely on what turned out to be the chimera of Loyalist support in its North American operations.<ref name=\"K447\">[[#Ketchum|Ketchum (1997)]], p. 447</ref> From 1778 to 1783, with or without their allies, France and Britain fought over dominance in the [[English Channel]], the [[Mediterranean]], the [[Indian Ocean]] and the [[West Indies]].{{sfn|Hagan|2009|p=51}}\n\nWithin days of the news of [[Saratoga campaign|Burgoyne's surrender]] reaching [[France]], [[Louis XVI of France|King Louis XVI]] decided to enter into negotiations with the Americans that resulted in a formal [[Franco-American alliance]] and the French entry into the war, moving the conflict onto a global stage.<ref name=\"K405_48\">[[#Ketchum|Ketchum (1997)]], pp. 405&ndash;448</ref> Spain did not enter into the war until 1779, when it entered the war as an ally of France pursuant to the secret [[Treaty of Aranjuez (1779)|Treaty of Aranjuez]].<ref name=\"N413\">[[#Nickerson|Nickerson (1967)]], p. 413</ref> Vergennes' diplomatic moves following the French war with Britain also had material impact on the later entry of the [[Dutch Republic]] into the war, and [[First League of Armed Neutrality|declarations of neutrality]] on the part of other important geopolitical players like [[Russian Empire|Russia]].<ref name=\"N415\">[[#Nickerson|Nickerson (1967)]], p. 415</ref> Opposition to the costly war was increasing, and in June 1780 contributed to disturbances in London known as the [[Gordon riots]].{{sfn|Ayling|1972|p=284}}\n\nThe two protagonists in the naval showdown in the Indian Ocean had as their objective the political dominance of the Indian subcontinent, and a series of battles fought by Admirals [[Edward Hughes (Royal Navy officer)|Edward Hughes]] and [[Pierre Andr\u00e9 de Suffren]] in 1782 and 1783 offered France a position to displaced the British from its territories.{{sfn|Mahan|1957|p=416}} The opportunity only ended when Suffren and Hughes had to stop fighting upon learning of the provisional [[Treaties of Versailles (1783)|Anglo-French-Spanish peace treaties]] of 1783.{{sfn|Hagan|2009|p=51}}\n\n==Origins==\n[[File:Vergennes, Charles Gravier comte de.jpg|thumb|Vergennes, foreign minister of France, worried that a war over the Bavarian succession would upset his plans against Britain|alt=Middle-aged, white-haired man wearing a blue velvet jacket, white shirt, and a chivalric order pinned to his jacket]]\n\nEver since the [[Seven Years' War]], [[France]]'s [[Foreign Minister]]s, beginning with [[C\u00e9sar Gabriel de Choiseul|Choiseul]], had followed the general idea that the independence of Britain's North American colonies would be good for France and bad for Britain, and furthermore that French attempts to recover parts of [[New France]] would be detrimental to that cause.<ref name=\"Nickerson26\">[[#Nickerson|Nickerson (1967)]], p. 26</ref>  When war broke out in 1775, the [[Charles Gravier, comte de Vergennes|Comte de Vergennes]], then the Foreign Minister, outlined a series of proposals that led to secret French and also Spanish support of the rebel movement, and preparations for the war, including expansion of their navies.<ref name=\"Nickerson65_6\">[[#Nickerson|Nickerson (1967)]], p. 65\u201366</ref> To further the aim of French participation in the war, Vergennes closely monitored news from North America and [[London]], and worked to remove impediments to Spanish participation in the war.<ref name=\"Nickerson66\">[[#Nickerson|Nickerson (1967)]], p. 66</ref>  Vergennes went so far as to propose war to [[Louis XVI of France|King Louis XVI]] in August 1776, but news of Howe's [[New York and New Jersey campaign|capture of New York City]] delayed that plan.<ref name=\"Nickerson75\">[[#Nickerson|Nickerson (1967)]], p. 75</ref>\n\nBy 1777, the Thirteen Colonies\u2018s rebellion was entering its third year. [[John Burgoyne]]'s surrender at the [[Battle of Saratoga]] had signalled that the struggle against the American colonies was likely to prove longer and more costly than expected. British defeat had raised the prospect of French intervention and of a European war.{{sfn|Stockley|2001|p=11}} North's government, fearful of war with France, sought reconciliation with the American colonies and was willing to grant a fair measure of autonomy to this end, but what would be enough in 1775 would no longer suffice by 1778. North had no intention of offering independence, but in the wake of Saratoga and with the prospect of a French alliance, the Americans were unlikely to agree with lesser terms.{{sfn|Stockley|2001|pp=11-12}}\n\nAlthough equally interested in maintaining its influence among the German states, France had a double problem. As a supporter of the rebellious British colonies in North America, it was in France's interest to avoid  a continental engagement. France could do more damage to the British in North America than in Europe.<ref>Berenger, p. 96</ref> The diplomatic realignment in 1756 had overthrown 200 years of French foreign policy that united the French Crown and the French populace against the House of Habsburg, arguably bringing to France massive territorial gains in repeated wars with Habsburg Austria and Habsburg Spain.<ref>Blanning, pp. 22&ndash;23</ref> A reversal of this policy in 1756 tied French foreign policy in Europe to Vienna. Despite this restructuring, there existed in the French Court at Versailles, and in France generally, a strong anti-Austrian sentiment.<ref>Berenger, p. 96</ref> The [[Diplomatic Revolution|diplomatic revolution]] of 1756, sealed in 1770 with the personal union (the diplomatic term for marriage) of [[Louis XVI of France|Louis]], the ''Dauphin of Viennois'', and the Austrian Archduchess [[Marie Antoinette]], was considered both a political and matrimonial  ''m\u00e9salliance'' in the eyes of many Frenchmen. It flew in the face of 200 years of French foreign policy, in which the central axiom \"had been hostility to the House of Habsburg\".<ref>Blanning, pp. 22&ndash;23</ref> The French foreign minister, the Comte de Vergennes, maintained deep-seated hostility to the Austrians that pre-dated the alliance of 1756. He had not approved of the shift of France's traditional bonds, and considered the Austrians untrustworthy. He managed to extricate France from immediate military obligations to Austria by 1778.<ref>Berenger, p. 96</ref>\n\n==Anglo-French naval crisis, 1778==\n\nOn 4 December 1777, word reached [[Benjamin Franklin]] at [[Versailles]] that Philadelphia had fallen and that Burgoyne had surrendered. Two days later, Louis XVI assented to negotiations for an alliance.<ref name=\"N411\">[[#Nickerson|Nickerson (1967)]], p. 411</ref> The [[Treaty of Alliance (1778)|treaty]] was signed on 6 February 1778, and France declared war on Britain one month later, with hostilities beginning with naval skirmishes off [[Ushant]] in June, notably the [[Action of 17 June 1778]].<ref name=\"N412\">[[#Nickerson|Nickerson (1967)]], p. 412</ref> [[George III]] did not welcome a war with France, but he was \"prepared\" for it. The king believed he had tried to avoid the conflict, but \"France chooses to be the Aggressor\", and Britain had taken \"all the steps necessary if it should end in war\".<ref>G, 2150</ref> He was \"prepared\" for armed conflict with the French by remembering British victories over that Bourbon power in the [[Seven Years' War]].{{sfn|Syrett|1998|p=17}}\n\nDuring that conflict, France had been pinned down in Europe fighting Continental powers while Britain defeated the French navy and won victories in India, the West Indies and North America. However, Britain's strategic position at the beginning of 1778 was far different from the one she enjoyed in 1756.{{sfn|Syrett|1998|p=17-18}} Gone was the alliance with the [[Kingdom of Prussia]]: in 1778 Britain was diplomatically isolated and without European allies. In the first months of this year, Britain attempted, without success, to find a Continental ally to engage the power of France.{{sfn|Scott|1990|p=264\u201372}} This failure produced the central strategic fact of the War of 1778: there would be no competing European campaigns to absorb France's strength. European isolation didn't matter in peacetime, but Britain was at serious disadvantage without European allies in war against France.{{sfn|1998|2007|p=18}}\n\nUnlike previous wars against the French, this one would offer Britain few, if any, strategic options like choosing to fight at Europe as opposed to one in Asia and America.<ref>Cf., Richard Pares, (1936): 429\u201365</ref> France and Britain fought over the [[Armada of 1779|control of the Channel]], as one of the episodes of the globalised warfare that followed the start of the hostilities in 1778. Early in the war, the [[Battle of Ushant 1778|first fleet action]] in European waters was fought on 27 July 1778, 100 miles west of [[Ushant]], an island at the mouth of the Channel. The two French and British battle fleets, of equal strength at 30 ships each, came to battle each other violently for several hours with neither side scoring a clear victory. The battle had been described since then as indecisive in its results.{{sfn|Mahan|1957|p=308}}\n\n==War in the West, 1778\u20131779==\n\nThe strategic and operational situation in the West was complex. It consisted of battles for [[naval supremacy]], raids on enemy convoys and colonies, and sorties in support of the sides fighting the [[War of the American Independence]].{{sfn|Hagan|2009|p=52}} The French blockaded Britain's most important sugar producers, [[Barbados]] and [[Jamaica]], cutting them off from food and supplies, with thousands dying from starvation and disease. Colonial militias played only limited supporting roles and more French and British troops died from the Caribbean climate and disease than from fighting.{{sfn|Mirza|2007|p=185}} One key territory that was of particular interest was the [[West Indies]] island of [[Dominica]], which lay between French-held [[Martinique]] and [[Guadeloupe]], and [[British expedition against Dominica|had been captured]] by Britain in 1761.  Recapture of the island would improve communication among the islands, and deny the use of Dominican ports to [[privateers]] who preyed on French shipping.<ref name=B36>Borom\u00e9, p. 36</ref> In August 1778, when [[Fran\u00e7ois Claude Amour, the marquis de Bouill\u00e9]], the French governor-general of [[Martinique]], received word that war had been declared.<ref name=B36/>\n\nThe [[French frigate Concorde (1777)|French frigate ''Concorde'']] reached Martinique on August 17 with orders from Paris to take Dominica at the earliest opportunity, and de Bouill\u00e9 made immediate plans for such an operation. He had maintained contacts in the Dominican population, which had remained largely French during the years of British administration. As a result, he had an accurate picture of the condition of the Dominican defences, and knew that the island's garrison numbered fewer than \"fifty soldiers fit for duty\".<ref name=B367>Borom\u00e9, pp. 36\u201337</ref> He was also concerned with the whereabouts of the British Leeward Islands fleet of Admiral [[Samuel Barrington]], which significantly exceeded his in military power.<ref name=B37>Borom\u00e9, p. 37</ref> Unbeknownst to de Bouill\u00e9, Barrington, who had only recently assumed his post, was under orders to retain most of his fleet at [[Barbados]] until further instructions were received.{{sfn|Mahan|1898|p=427}} The British regular forces on the island, which in total numbered about 100, were distributed amongst defences in the capital [[Roseau, Dominica|Roseau]], the hills that overlooked it, and at Cachacrou.<ref>Atwood, p. 109</ref>\n\nDe Bouill\u00e9 carefully maintained a fa\u00e7ade of peace in his dealings with Dominican authorities while he began preparing his forces on Martinique.

Although Washington failed to cooperate with his allies, being fixated on attacking the British in New York City, D'Estaing landed the troops in aid to the Americans before he returned to France, as he had been ordered to do. On 9 October 1779, in concert with a contingent of the Continental Army, the French admiral initiated an assault on the besieged city. The well-fortified British army repulsed the invaders; d'Estaing was seriously wounded and had to sail for Europe.

Although Rodney's ultimate orders were to command the [[West Indies]] fleet, he had secret instructions to first resupply Gibraltar and [[Minorca]] and on 4 January 1780 the fleet divided, with ships headed for the West Indies sailing westward. This left Rodney in command of 19 [[ships of the line]] which were to accompany the supply ships to Gibraltar.{{sfn|Syrett|2007|p=234, 237}}\n\nThe supply convoy sailed into Gibraltar on January 19, driving the smaller blockading fleet to retreat to the safety of [[Algeciras]].

When in July 1780 the Lieutenant General [[Comte de Rochambeau]], arrived in Newport with an army of 6,000 men, he described the situation: \"in any operation, and under all circumstances, a decisive naval superiority is to be considered as a fundamental principle, and the basis upon which every hope of success must ultimately depend\".{{sfn|Mahan|1957|p=352}} The Dutch were helping the American rebels by selling them guns and gunpowder from their ports in the Caribbean. The British used this as a pretext to declare war on the Netherlands in December 1780.

The [[Continental Army]] had suffered major defeats earlier in the year, with its southern armies either captured or dispersed in the [[Siege of Charleston|loss of Charleston]] and the [[Battle of Camden]] in the south, while the armies of [[George Washington]] and the British [[Commander-in-Chief, North America|commander-in-chief for North America]], [[Henry Clinton (American War of Independence)|Sir Henry Clinton]] watched each other around [[New York City]] in the north.<ref>Ketchum, p. 92</ref>  The [[Continental dollar|national currency]] was virtually worthless, public support for the war, about to enter its sixth year, was waning, and army troops were becoming mutinous over pay and conditions.<ref>Ketchum, pp. 8,12</ref>\n\nFrench military planners had to balance competing demands for the 1781 campaign. After a series of unsuccessful Americans attempts at cooperation (leading to unsuccessful attempts on [[Battle of Rhode Island|Newport, Rhode Island]] and [[Siege of Savannah|Savannah, Georgia]]), they decided more involvement in North America was necessary.<ref>Dull, pp. 247\u2013248</ref> They also needed to coordinate their actions with [[Spain]], as there was potential interest in making an assault on the British stronghold of [[Jamaica]].

The West Indies fleet, led by the [[Fran\u00e7ois Joseph Paul de Grasse|Comte de Grasse]], after operations in the [[Windward Islands]], was directed to go to Cap-Fran\u00e7ais (present-day [[Cap-Ha\u00eftien]]) to determine what resources would be required to assist Spanish operations. Due to a lack of transports, France also provided six million [[livres]] to support the American war effort beyond of providing additional troops.<ref>Dull, p. 329</ref> The French fleet at Newport was given a new commander, the [[Jacques-Melchior, Comte de Barras Saint-Laurent|Comte de Barras]]. De Barras was ordered to take the Newport fleet to harass British shipping off [[Nova Scotia]] and [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]], and the French army at Newport was ordered to combine with Washington's army outside New York.<ref>Carrington, p. 614</ref> In orders that were deliberately not fully shared with General Washington, De Grasse was instructed to assist in North American operations after his stop at Cap-Fran\u00e7ais. The French general, the [[Jean-Baptiste Donatien de Vimeur, comte de Rochambeau|Comte de Rochambeau]] was instructed to tell Washington that de Grasse ''might'' be able to assist, without making any commitment.<ref name=Dull241>Dull, p. 241</ref>  (Washington learned from [[John Laurens]], stationed in [[Paris]], that de Grasse had discretion to come north.)<ref>Grainger, p. 40</ref>\n\nDe Grasse received these letters in July at roughly the same time Cornwallis was preparing to occupy [[Yorktown, Virginia]]. De Grasse concurred with Rochambeau and subsequently sent a dispatch indicating that he would reach the Chesapeake at the end of August but that agreements with the Spanish meant he could only stay until mid-October. The arrival of his dispatches prompted the Franco-American army to begin a march for Virginia. De Grasse reached the Chesapeake as planned, and his troops were sent to assist Lafayette's army in the blockade of Cornwallis. A British fleet sent to confront de Grasse's control of the Chesapeake was defeated by the French on September 5 at the [[Battle of the Chesapeake]], and the Newport fleet delivered the French siege train to complete the allied military arrival. The [[Siege of Yorktown]] and following surrender by Cornwallis on October 19 were decisive in ending major hostilities in North America.<ref>{{cite book|author=Henry Lumpkin|title=From Savannah to Yorktown: The American Revolution in the South|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wuhkAbCnJvYC&pg=PA235|year=2000|publisher=iUniverse|page=235}}</ref>\n\n==Antilles War, 1781-1783==\n\nIn October 1781, a plan had been worked out between de Grasse, commander of the French fleet in the West Indies, and [[Francisco Saavedra de Sangronis]], General Bureau for the Spanish Indies, court representative and aide to the Spanish [[Governor of Louisiana]], [[Bernardo de G\u00e1lvez]]. The strategic objectives of this plan were to guide the Franco-Spanish military forces in the West Indies to accomplish the following objectives:\n\n*To aid the Americans and defeat the British naval squadron at [[New York City|New York]],\n*The capture of the British [[Windward Islands]], and\n*The conquest of Jamaica.<ref>Dull p. 244</ref>\n\nThis plan became known as the ''De Grasse \u2013 Saavedra Convention'' and the first objective was essentially met with the surrender of the British army under [[Charles Cornwallis, 1st Marquess Cornwallis|General Cornwallis]] at the [[Siege of Yorktown]] in September 1781. De Grasse and his fleet had [[Battle of the Chesapeake|played a decisive part]] in that victory, after which they then sailed to the Caribbean. On arrival in [[Saint Domingue]] November 1781 he was given news that the plan was given the go ahead: to proceed with the conquest of Jamaica.<ref>Dull p. 248-49</ref>\n\nJamaica was the most profitable British possession in the New World, in particular the commodity that stood out the most was [[sugar]]; it was more valuable to the British economy than the thirteen American colonies combined. In a letter from [[King George III]] to [[John Montagu, 4th Earl of Sandwich|Lord Sandwich]] he declared that he would risk protecting Britain's important Caribbean islands at the risk of Britain herself, and this was strategy implemented in 1779.<ref>O'Shaughnessy p. 208</ref> Sugar made up 20% of all British imports and was worth five times as much as [[tobacco]].<ref>Rogozi\u0144ski p. 115</ref> As well as the gradual expulsion of the British from the West Indies by the French and Spanish, the conquest was to force a massive blow on the British economy.<ref>Trew p. 154-55</ref> The invasion itself though was perceived in the courts at [[Paris]] and [[Madrid]] as an alternative to the Spanish and French attempts [[Great Siege of Gibraltar|to take Gibraltar]] which for two years had been a costly disaster.<ref>Dull p. 282</ref>\n\nWhile de Grasse waited for reinforcements to undertake the Jamaica campaign, he [[Siege of Brimstone Hill|captured St. Kitts]] in February 1782. The rest of the Windward Islands ([[Antigua]], [[St Lucia]], and [[Barbados]]) still remained under British control, while Admiral George Rodney arrived in the Caribbean theatre the following month, having brought reinforcements. These included seventeen ships of the line, and gave the British a slight advantage in number.<ref name=\"Trew\">Trew p. 157-62</ref>\n\nOn 7 April 1782, de Grasse set out from [[Martinique]] with 35 [[ships of the line]], including two 50-gun ships and a large convoy of more than 100 cargo ships, to meet with a Spanish fleet consisting of 12 ships of the line. In addition de Grasse was to rendezvous with 15,000 troops at Saint Domingue earmarked for the conquest by landing on Jamaica's North coast.<ref name=\"Trew\"/> Rodney on learning of this then sailed from [[St Lucia]] in pursuit now with 36 [[ships of the line]] the following day.<ref name=\"Mahan1\">Mahan. p. 205\u2212226 </ref>\n\nThe British ships by this time had [[Hull (watercraft)|hull]]s which gone through a process known as  [[copper sheathing]]; found to be a practicable means of protecting them from [[barnacle|marine growth]] and [[biofouling|fouling]] as well as salt water corrosion.

Rear-Admiral Sir Samuel Hood fought under Rodney during the battle, and was deeply critical of his commander for not pushing home his victory against the retreating enemy fleet. The British fleet made its way to Jamaica, from where Rodney ordered Hood to seek out any disabled or damaged French ships that had escaped the battle. Hood's division of thirteen ships set out towards toward [[San Domingo]], and while travelling through the Mona Passage, came across a number of French ships which had become separated before the battle of the Saintes and were on their way to [[Cap-Fran\u00e7ais]].<ref>Harvey p.530</ref>\n\nBy the end of 1782 the French had been on defensive in the Caribbean, which signalled a stalemate of the seas.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Mahan|first1=Alfred Thayer|title=The Major Operations of the Navies in the War of American Independence|date=2013|publisher=BoD \u2013 Books on Demand|isbn=9783954273393|pages=225\u20136|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=VHePQBiqqckC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Major+Operations+of+the+Navies+in+the+War+of+Independence&hl=en&sa=X&ei=dN8iVML2AsGe7gaVi4C4Ag&ved=0CCkQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=Major%20Operations%20of%20the%20Navies%20in%20the%20War%20of%20Independence&f=false|accessdate=24 September 2014}}</ref> Soon after, the Royal navy was conducting a [[blockade]] off [[Cap-Ha\u00eftien|Cap Francois]] and [[Fort Royal]] as well as keeping a watch off [[Havana]].<ref>Marley p. 175</ref> At the same time British frigates were battling both Spanish and French [[privateer]]s.<ref>{{cite book|title=Publications of the Navy Records Society, Volume 35|date=1908|publisher=Navy Records Society|page=264|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=u5pSEFrTC78C&q=blockade+cap+francois+1782&dq=blockade+cap+francois+1782&hl=en&sa=X&ei=bvQrVLbGG-GV7AaxxoDYDg&ved=0CEkQ6AEwBw}}</ref>\n\n==East Indies Campaign, 1782\u20131783==\n\n[[Pierre Andr\u00e9 de Suffren Saint-Tropez|Suffren]], an aggressive fighter and seeker of decisive action, foiled a British attempt to take the Cape in early 1781, [[Battle of Porto Praya|attacking]] a Royal Navy squadron at [[Porto Praya]] in the [[Cape Verde Islands]] which are in the Atlantic about 450 miles west of [[Africa]].

Although a [[Hudson Bay Expedition|French naval expedition]] had destroyed British trading posts in [[Hudson Bay]] during the summer, no territory had actually been captured. From time to time, news would arrive from [[India]] of continuing stalemate, both in the land wars (which involved the French only as supporters to local rulers) and in naval battles; the British still appeared to hold all the French territory there that they had captured in 1778\u201379, while the French held no British territory. In the West Indies, on the other hand, the French still held all the territory they had captured, while the British held only one French island, [[St. Lucia]].\n\nIn the preliminary treaties signed with France and Spain on 20 January 1783, France and Britain returned to each other nearly all the territories they had taken from each other since 1778, except for [[Tobago]], which the French had captured in 1781 and were allowed to keep. France also gained some territory around the [[Senegal]] River in Africa which it had lost to Britain in 1763. The whole arrangement for fishing around the Newfoundland coast had to be renegotiated because of the rights awarded to the Americans.\n\n==Historians' perceptions==\n\nIn [[Alfred Thayer Mahan]]'s view, British strategy had been fundamentally flawed. By necessarily needing large and substantial contingents at home to prevent invasion by France and to protect converging trade routes while sending detachments to other war theatres, Great Britain exposed its military forces to defeat in detail. The best policy, in his opinion, {{quote|to be effective, calls for superior numbers, because the different divisions are too far apart for mutual support. Each must therefore be equal to any probable combination against it, which implies superiority everywhere to the force of the enemy actually opposed, as the latter may be unexpectedly reinforced.

In 1778, France signed a [[Treaty of Alliance (1778)|treaty of friendship]] with the United States. Great Britain was then at war with France, and in 1779 it was also at war with Spain.{{sfn|Ayling|1972|pp=275\u2013276}} As a consequence, Great Britain was forced to divert resources used to fight the war in North America to [[theatre (warfare)|theatre]]s in [[Europe]], [[India]] and the [[West Indies]], and to rely on what turned out to be the chimera of Loyalist support in its North American operations.<ref name=\"K447\">[[#Ketchum|Ketchum (1997)]], p. 447</ref> From 1778 to 1783, with or without their allies, France and Britain fought over dominance in the [[English Channel]], the [[Mediterranean]], the [[Indian Ocean]] and the [[West Indies]].{{sfn|Hagan|2009|p=51}}\n\nWithin days of the news of [[Saratoga campaign|Burgoyne's surrender]] reaching [[France]], [[Louis XVI of France|King Louis XVI]] decided to enter into negotiations with the Americans that resulted in a formal [[Franco-American alliance]] and the French entry into the war, moving the conflict onto a global stage.<ref name=\"K405_48\">[[#Ketchum|Ketchum (1997)]], pp. 405&ndash;448</ref> Spain did not enter into the war until 1779, when it entered the war as an ally of France pursuant to the secret [[Treaty of Aranjuez (1779)|Treaty of Aranjuez]].<ref name=\"N413\">[[#Nickerson|Nickerson (1967)]], p. 413</ref> Vergennes' diplomatic moves following the French war with Britain also had material impact on the later entry of the [[Dutch Republic]] into the war, and [[First League of Armed Neutrality|declarations of neutrality]] on the part of other important geopolitical players like [[Russian Empire|Russia]].<ref name=\"N415\">[[#Nickerson|Nickerson (1967)]], p. 415</ref> Opposition to the costly war was increasing, and in June 1780 contributed to disturbances in London known as the [[Gordon riots]].{{sfn|Ayling|1972|p=284}}\n\nThe two protagonists in the naval showdown in the Indian Ocean had as their objective the political dominance of the Indian subcontinent, and a series of battles fought by Admirals [[Edward Hughes (Royal Navy officer)|Edward Hughes]] and [[Pierre Andr\u00e9 de Suffren]] in 1782 and 1783 offered France a position to displaced the British from its territories.{{sfn|Mahan|1957|p=416}} The opportunity only ended when Suffren and Hughes had to stop fighting upon learning of the provisional [[Treaties of Versailles (1783)|Anglo-French-Spanish peace treaties]] of 1783.{{sfn|Hagan|2009|p=51}}\n\n==Origins==\n[[File:Vergennes, Charles Gravier comte de.jpg|thumb|Vergennes, foreign minister of France, worried that a war over the Bavarian succession would upset his plans against Britain|alt=Middle-aged, white-haired man wearing a blue velvet jacket, white shirt, and a chivalric order pinned to his jacket]]\n\nEver since the [[Seven Years' War]], [[France]]'s [[Foreign Minister]]s, beginning with [[C\u00e9sar Gabriel de Choiseul|Choiseul]], had followed the general idea that the independence of Britain's North American colonies would be good for France and bad for Britain, and furthermore that French attempts to recover parts of [[New France]] would be detrimental to that cause.<ref name=\"Nickerson26\">[[#Nickerson|Nickerson (1967)]], p. 26</ref>  When war broke out in 1775, the [[Charles Gravier, comte de Vergennes|Comte de Vergennes]], then the Foreign Minister, outlined a series of proposals that led to secret French and also Spanish support of the rebel movement, and preparations for the war, including expansion of their navies.<ref name=\"Nickerson65_6\">[[#Nickerson|Nickerson (1967)]], p. 65\u201366</ref> To further the aim of French participation in the war, Vergennes closely monitored news from North America and [[London]], and worked to remove impediments to Spanish participation in the war.<ref name=\"Nickerson66\">[[#Nickerson|Nickerson (1967)]], p. 66</ref>  Vergennes went so far as to propose war to [[Louis XVI of France|King Louis XVI]] in August 1776, but news of Howe's [[New York and New Jersey campaign|capture of New York City]] delayed that plan.<ref name=\"Nickerson75\">[[#Nickerson|Nickerson (1967)]], p. 75</ref>\n\nBy 1777, the Thirteen Colonies\u2018s rebellion was entering its third year. [[John Burgoyne]]'s surrender at the [[Battle of Saratoga]] had signalled that the struggle against the American colonies was likely to prove longer and more costly than expected. British defeat had raised the prospect of French intervention and of a European war.{{sfn|Stockley|2001|p=11}} North's government, fearful of war with France, sought reconciliation with the American colonies and was willing to grant a fair measure of autonomy to this end, but what would be enough in 1775 would no longer suffice by 1778. North had no intention of offering independence, but in the wake of Saratoga and with the prospect of a French alliance, the Americans were unlikely to agree with lesser terms.{{sfn|Stockley|2001|pp=11-12}}\n\nAlthough equally interested in maintaining its influence among the German states, France had a double problem. As a supporter of the rebellious British colonies in North America, it was in France's interest to avoid  a continental engagement. France could do more damage to the British in North America than in Europe.<ref>Berenger, p. 96</ref> The diplomatic realignment in 1756 had overthrown 200 years of French foreign policy that united the French Crown and the French populace against the House of Habsburg, arguably bringing to France massive territorial gains in repeated wars with Habsburg Austria and Habsburg Spain.<ref>Blanning, pp. 22&ndash;23</ref> A reversal of this policy in 1756 tied French foreign policy in Europe to Vienna. Despite this restructuring, there existed in the French Court at Versailles, and in France generally, a strong anti-Austrian sentiment.<ref>Berenger, p. 96</ref> The [[Diplomatic Revolution|diplomatic revolution]] of 1756, sealed in 1770 with the personal union (the diplomatic term for marriage) of [[Louis XVI of France|Louis]], the ''Dauphin of Viennois'', and the Austrian Archduchess [[Marie Antoinette]], was considered both a political and matrimonial  ''m\u00e9salliance'' in the eyes of many Frenchmen. It flew in the face of 200 years of French foreign policy, in which the central axiom \"had been hostility to the House of Habsburg\".<ref>Blanning, pp. 22&ndash;23</ref> The French foreign minister, the Comte de Vergennes, maintained deep-seated hostility to the Austrians that pre-dated the alliance of 1756. He had not approved of the shift of France's traditional bonds, and considered the Austrians untrustworthy. He managed to extricate France from immediate military obligations to Austria by 1778.<ref>Berenger, p. 96</ref>\n\n==Anglo-French naval crisis, 1778==\n\nOn 4 December 1777, word reached [[Benjamin Franklin]] at [[Versailles]] that Philadelphia had fallen and that Burgoyne had surrendered. Two days later, Louis XVI assented to negotiations for an alliance.<ref name=\"N411\">[[#Nickerson|Nickerson (1967)]], p. 411</ref> The [[Treaty of Alliance (1778)|treaty]] was signed on 6 February 1778, and France declared war on Britain one month later, with hostilities beginning with naval skirmishes off [[Ushant]] in June, notably the [[Action of 17 June 1778]].<ref name=\"N412\">[[#Nickerson|Nickerson (1967)]], p. 412</ref> [[George III]] did not welcome a war with France, but he was \"prepared\" for it. The king believed he had tried to avoid the conflict, but \"France chooses to be the Aggressor\", and Britain had taken \"all the steps necessary if it should end in war\".<ref>G, 2150</ref> He was \"prepared\" for armed conflict with the French by remembering British victories over that Bourbon power in the [[Seven Years' War]].{{sfn|Syrett|1998|p=17}}\n\nDuring that conflict, France had been pinned down in Europe fighting Continental powers while Britain defeated the French navy and won victories in India, the West Indies and North America. However, Britain's strategic position at the beginning of 1778 was far different from the one she enjoyed in 1756.{{sfn|Syrett|1998|p=17-18}} Gone was the alliance with the [[Kingdom of Prussia]]: in 1778 Britain was diplomatically isolated and without European allies. In the first months of this year, Britain attempted, without success, to find a Continental ally to engage the power of France.{{sfn|Scott|1990|p=264\u201372}} This failure produced the central strategic fact of the War of 1778: there would be no competing European campaigns to absorb France's strength. European isolation didn't matter in peacetime, but Britain was at serious disadvantage without European allies in war against France.{{sfn|1998|2007|p=18}}\n\nUnlike previous wars against the French, this one would offer Britain few, if any, strategic options like choosing to fight at Europe as opposed to one in Asia and America.<ref>Cf., Richard Pares, (1936): 429\u201365</ref> France and Britain fought over the [[Armada of 1779|control of the Channel]], as one of the episodes of the globalised warfare that followed the start of the hostilities in 1778. Early in the war, the [[Battle of Ushant 1778|first fleet action]] in European waters was fought on 27 July 1778, 100 miles west of [[Ushant]], an island at the mouth of the Channel. The two French and British battle fleets, of equal strength at 30 ships each, came to battle each other violently for several hours with neither side scoring a clear victory. The battle had been described since then as indecisive in its results.{{sfn|Mahan|1957|p=308}}\n\n==War in the West, 1778\u20131779==\n\nThe strategic and operational situation in the West was complex. It consisted of battles for [[naval supremacy]], raids on enemy convoys and colonies, and sorties in support of the sides fighting the [[War of the American Independence]].{{sfn|Hagan|2009|p=52}} The French blockaded Britain's most important sugar producers, [[Barbados]] and [[Jamaica]], cutting them off from food and supplies, with thousands dying from starvation and disease. Colonial militias played only limited supporting roles and more French and British troops died from the Caribbean climate and disease than from fighting.{{sfn|Mirza|2007|p=185}} One key territory that was of particular interest was the [[West Indies]] island of [[Dominica]], which lay between French-held [[Martinique]] and [[Guadeloupe]], and [[British expedition against Dominica|had been captured]] by Britain in 1761.  Recapture of the island would improve communication among the islands, and deny the use of Dominican ports to [[privateers]] who preyed on French shipping.<ref name=B36>Borom\u00e9, p. 36</ref> In August 1778, when [[Fran\u00e7ois Claude Amour, the marquis de Bouill\u00e9]], the French governor-general of [[Martinique]], received word that war had been declared.<ref name=B36/>\n\nThe [[French frigate Concorde (1777)|French frigate ''Concorde'']] reached Martinique on August 17 with orders from Paris to take Dominica at the earliest opportunity, and de Bouill\u00e9 made immediate plans for such an operation. He had maintained contacts in the Dominican population, which had remained largely French during the years of British administration. As a result, he had an accurate picture of the condition of the Dominican defences, and knew that the island's garrison numbered fewer than \"fifty soldiers fit for duty\".<ref name=B367>Borom\u00e9, pp. 36\u201337</ref> He was also concerned with the whereabouts of the British Leeward Islands fleet of Admiral [[Samuel Barrington]], which significantly exceeded his in military power.<ref name=B37>Borom\u00e9, p. 37</ref> Unbeknownst to de Bouill\u00e9, Barrington, who had only recently assumed his post, was under orders to retain most of his fleet at [[Barbados]] until further instructions were received.{{sfn|Mahan|1898|p=427}} The British regular forces on the island, which in total numbered about 100, were distributed amongst defences in the capital [[Roseau, Dominica|Roseau]], the hills that overlooked it, and at Cachacrou.<ref>Atwood, p. 109</ref>\n\nDe Bouill\u00e9 carefully maintained a fa\u00e7ade of peace in his dealings with Dominican authorities while he began preparing his forces on Martinique. On 2 September he and Lieutenant Governor Stuart signed an agreement that formally prohibited privateering crews to plunder. The next day de Bouill\u00e9 sent one of his officers to Dominica to see whether a [[Royal Navy]] [[frigate]] was still anchored in Prince Rupert's Bay (near present-day [[Portsmouth, Dominica|Portsmouth]]). Stuart, suspicious of the man, had him questioned and then released.<ref name=B37/> On 5 September de Bouill\u00e9 was informed that the frigate had sailed for Barbados.<ref name=B37/> He struck fast, [[Invasion of Dominica (1778)|defeating]] the British at [[Dominica]] in September 1778.{{sfn|Mirza|2007|p=185}} De Bouill\u00e9 left a garrison of 800 (700 French regulars and 100 free black militia) on the island, turned its command over to the Marquis de Duchilleau, and returned to Martinique.<ref>Borom\u00e9, p. 41</ref> These events were the first in a series of military actions resulting in the change of control of Caribbean islands during the war, in which De Bouill\u00e9 was often involved.<ref>Marley, pp. 489\u2013521</ref>\n\nNews of Dominica's fall was received with surprise in [[London]] considering that a single [[ship of the line]] might have prevented the attack, Admiral Barrington was widely blamed for the loss, and criticised for adhering too closely to his orders.<ref name=B40>Borom\u00e9, p. 40</ref> French Admiral the [[Charles Hector, comte d'Estaing|comte D'Estaing]] arrived in the [[West Indies]] in early December 1778 in command of a fleet consisting of 12 [[ships of the line]] and a number of smaller vessels.{{sfn|Mahan|1898|pp=429\u2013431}} At about the same time a British fleet under Admiral [[William Hotham, 1st Baron Hotham|William Hotham]] also arrived, augmenting the West Indies fleet of Admiral [[Samuel Barrington]].{{sfn|Mahan|1898|p=429}} The orders and reinforcements whose late arrival had held Admiral Barrington at Barbados were to launch an attack on French-held [[St. Lucia]], which the British then [[Capture of St. Lucia|captured]] in December 1778.<ref>Mackesy, pp. 230\u2013232</ref> Despite d'Estaing's [[Battle of St. Lucia|attempt at relief]], the British used St. Lucia to monitor the major French base at [[Martinique]], where d'Estaing was headquartered.{{sfn|Mahan|1898|pp=429\u2013432}}\n\nThe British fleet was further reinforced in January 1779 by ten ships of the line under Admiral [[John Byron]], who assumed command of the British [[Leeward Islands]] station.<ref>Colomb, p. 388</ref> Throughout the first half of 1779 both fleets received further reinforcements, after which the French fleet was superior to that of the British.<ref>Colomb, pp. 388\u2013389</ref>  Furthermore, Byron departed St. Lucia on 6 June in order to provide escort services to British merchant ships gathering at [[St. Kitts]] for a convoy to Europe, leaving d'Estaing free to act.  D'Estaing and de Bouill\u00e9, seised the opportunity to begin a series of operations against nearby British possessions.<ref name=\"Colomb, p. 389\">Colomb, p. 389</ref> Their first target was the isle of [[Saint Vincent (island)|Saint Vincent]], south of St. Lucia.<ref name=\"Colomb, p. 389\"/> It [[Capture of Saint Vincent|fell]] on 18 June, and d'Estaing turned his attention to other islands. He had hoped to capture [[Barbados]], a key British possession, but after making no progress against the prevailing easterly [[trade winds]], he turned his attention instead to [[Grenada]].<ref>Colomb, p. 390</ref>  The French fleet arrived off Grenada on 2 July, and [[Capture of Grenada|stormed its main defences]] beginning late on 3 July.  Terms of capitulation were agreed on the 4th.<ref name=C391>Colomb, p. 391</ref>\n\nThe [[Siege of Savannah|first large expedition]] to the North was undertaken in 1779 by French [[Vice Admiral]] d'Estaing. In the attempt to invade the British-occupied [[Savannah, Georgia|Savannah]], the French brought 20 ships-of-the-line and 3,000 troops in transports to Georgia. Although Washington failed to cooperate with his allies, being fixated on attacking the British in New York City, D'Estaing landed the troops in aid to the Americans before he returned to France, as he had been ordered to do. On 9 October 1779, in concert with a contingent of the Continental Army, the French admiral initiated an assault on the besieged city. The well-fortified British army repulsed the invaders; d'Estaing was seriously wounded and had to sail for Europe. Despite a correct strategic concept, allied cooperation eluded successful operational implementation.{{sfn|Hagan|2009|p=52}}\n\n==East Indies, 1778\u20131780==\n{{see also|Second Anglo-Mysore War}}\n\nOne clear result of the renewal of the Anglo-French contest in the East Indies between 1778\u20131783 was a greater appreciation by the British of the strategic needs of their newly acquired possessions in Asia. The superimposition of a global struggle between European powers upon several localised Indian wars did unnerve the Company and seriously embarrass its presidencies.<ref>Kennedy, ''Anglo-French Rivalry in India'', chap. 5; S.P. Sen, ''The French in India 1763\u20141816'' (Calcutta, 1958), chaps.

By late 1779, however, supplies in Gibraltar had become seriously depleted, and its commander, General [[George Augustus Eliott, 1st Baron Heathfield|George Eliott]], appealed to [[London]] for relief.{{sfn|Chartrand|2006|p=37}}\n\nA supply convoy was organised, and in late December 1779 a large fleet sailed from Britain under the command of Admiral [[George Brydges Rodney, 1st Baron Rodney|Sir George Brydges Rodney]]. Although Rodney's ultimate orders were to command the [[West Indies]] fleet, he had secret instructions to first resupply Gibraltar and [[Minorca]] and on 4 January 1780 the fleet divided, with ships headed for the West Indies sailing westward. This left Rodney in command of 19 [[ships of the line]] which were to accompany the supply ships to Gibraltar.{{sfn|Syrett|2007|p=234, 237}}\n\nThe supply convoy sailed into Gibraltar on January 19, driving the smaller blockading fleet to retreat to the safety of [[Algeciras]].

When in July 1780 the Lieutenant General [[Comte de Rochambeau]], arrived in Newport with an army of 6,000 men, he described the situation: \"in any operation, and under all circumstances, a decisive naval superiority is to be considered as a fundamental principle, and the basis upon which every hope of success must ultimately depend\".{{sfn|Mahan|1957|p=352}} The Dutch were helping the American rebels by selling them guns and gunpowder from their ports in the Caribbean. The British used this as a pretext to declare war on the Netherlands in December 1780.

The [[Continental Army]] had suffered major defeats earlier in the year, with its southern armies either captured or dispersed in the [[Siege of Charleston|loss of Charleston]] and the [[Battle of Camden]] in the south, while the armies of [[George Washington]] and the British [[Commander-in-Chief, North America|commander-in-chief for North America]], [[Henry Clinton (American War of Independence)|Sir Henry Clinton]] watched each other around [[New York City]] in the north.<ref>Ketchum, p. 92</ref>  The [[Continental dollar|national currency]] was virtually worthless, public support for the war, about to enter its sixth year, was waning, and army troops were becoming mutinous over pay and conditions.<ref>Ketchum, pp. 8,12</ref>\n\nFrench military planners had to balance competing demands for the 1781 campaign. After a series of unsuccessful Americans attempts at cooperation (leading to unsuccessful attempts on [[Battle of Rhode Island|Newport, Rhode Island]] and [[Siege of Savannah|Savannah, Georgia]]), they decided more involvement in North America was necessary.<ref>Dull, pp. 247\u2013248</ref> They also needed to coordinate their actions with [[Spain]], as there was potential interest in making an assault on the British stronghold of [[Jamaica]].

The West Indies fleet, led by the [[Fran\u00e7ois Joseph Paul de Grasse|Comte de Grasse]], after operations in the [[Windward Islands]], was directed to go to Cap-Fran\u00e7ais (present-day [[Cap-Ha\u00eftien]]) to determine what resources would be required to assist Spanish operations. Due to a lack of transports, France also provided six million [[livres]] to support the American war effort beyond of providing additional troops.<ref>Dull, p. 329</ref> The French fleet at Newport was given a new commander, the [[Jacques-Melchior, Comte de Barras Saint-Laurent|Comte de Barras]]. De Barras was ordered to take the Newport fleet to harass British shipping off [[Nova Scotia]] and [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]], and the French army at Newport was ordered to combine with Washington's army outside New York.<ref>Carrington, p. 614</ref> In orders that were deliberately not fully shared with General Washington, De Grasse was instructed to assist in North American operations after his stop at Cap-Fran\u00e7ais. The French general, the [[Jean-Baptiste Donatien de Vimeur, comte de Rochambeau|Comte de Rochambeau]] was instructed to tell Washington that de Grasse ''might'' be able to assist, without making any commitment.<ref name=Dull241>Dull, p. 241</ref>  (Washington learned from [[John Laurens]], stationed in [[Paris]], that de Grasse had discretion to come north.)<ref>Grainger, p. 40</ref>\n\nDe Grasse received these letters in July at roughly the same time Cornwallis was preparing to occupy [[Yorktown, Virginia]]. De Grasse concurred with Rochambeau and subsequently sent a dispatch indicating that he would reach the Chesapeake at the end of August but that agreements with the Spanish meant he could only stay until mid-October. The arrival of his dispatches prompted the Franco-American army to begin a march for Virginia. De Grasse reached the Chesapeake as planned, and his troops were sent to assist Lafayette's army in the blockade of Cornwallis. A British fleet sent to confront de Grasse's control of the Chesapeake was defeated by the French on September 5 at the [[Battle of the Chesapeake]], and the Newport fleet delivered the French siege train to complete the allied military arrival. The [[Siege of Yorktown]] and following surrender by Cornwallis on October 19 were decisive in ending major hostilities in North America.<ref>{{cite book|author=Henry Lumpkin|title=From Savannah to Yorktown: The American Revolution in the South|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wuhkAbCnJvYC&pg=PA235|year=2000|publisher=iUniverse|page=235}}</ref>\n\n==Antilles War, 1781-1783==\n\nIn October 1781, a plan had been worked out between de Grasse, commander of the French fleet in the West Indies, and [[Francisco Saavedra de Sangronis]], General Bureau for the Spanish Indies, court representative and aide to the Spanish [[Governor of Louisiana]], [[Bernardo de G\u00e1lvez]]. The strategic objectives of this plan were to guide the Franco-Spanish military forces in the West Indies to accomplish the following objectives:\n\n*To aid the Americans and defeat the British naval squadron at [[New York City|New York]],\n*The capture of the British [[Windward Islands]], and\n*The conquest of Jamaica.<ref>Dull p. 244</ref>\n\nThis plan became known as the ''De Grasse \u2013 Saavedra Convention'' and the first objective was essentially met with the surrender of the British army under [[Charles Cornwallis, 1st Marquess Cornwallis|General Cornwallis]] at the [[Siege of Yorktown]] in September 1781. De Grasse and his fleet had [[Battle of the Chesapeake|played a decisive part]] in that victory, after which they then sailed to the Caribbean. On arrival in [[Saint Domingue]] November 1781 he was given news that the plan was given the go ahead: to proceed with the conquest of Jamaica.<ref>Dull p. 248-49</ref>\n\nJamaica was the most profitable British possession in the New World, in particular the commodity that stood out the most was [[sugar]]; it was more valuable to the British economy than the thirteen American colonies combined. In a letter from [[King George III]] to [[John Montagu, 4th Earl of Sandwich|Lord Sandwich]] he declared that he would risk protecting Britain's important Caribbean islands at the risk of Britain herself, and this was strategy implemented in 1779.<ref>O'Shaughnessy p. 208</ref> Sugar made up 20% of all British imports and was worth five times as much as [[tobacco]].<ref>Rogozi\u0144ski p. 115</ref> As well as the gradual expulsion of the British from the West Indies by the French and Spanish, the conquest was to force a massive blow on the British economy.<ref>Trew p. 154-55</ref> The invasion itself though was perceived in the courts at [[Paris]] and [[Madrid]] as an alternative to the Spanish and French attempts [[Great Siege of Gibraltar|to take Gibraltar]] which for two years had been a costly disaster.<ref>Dull p. 282</ref>\n\nWhile de Grasse waited for reinforcements to undertake the Jamaica campaign, he [[Siege of Brimstone Hill|captured St. Kitts]] in February 1782. The rest of the Windward Islands ([[Antigua]], [[St Lucia]], and [[Barbados]]) still remained under British control, while Admiral George Rodney arrived in the Caribbean theatre the following month, having brought reinforcements. These included seventeen ships of the line, and gave the British a slight advantage in number.<ref name=\"Trew\">Trew p. 157-62</ref>\n\nOn 7 April 1782, de Grasse set out from [[Martinique]] with 35 [[ships of the line]], including two 50-gun ships and a large convoy of more than 100 cargo ships, to meet with a Spanish fleet consisting of 12 ships of the line. In addition de Grasse was to rendezvous with 15,000 troops at Saint Domingue earmarked for the conquest by landing on Jamaica's North coast.<ref name=\"Trew\"/> Rodney on learning of this then sailed from [[St Lucia]] in pursuit now with 36 [[ships of the line]] the following day.<ref name=\"Mahan1\">Mahan. p. 205\u2212226 </ref>\n\nThe British ships by this time had [[Hull (watercraft)|hull]]s which gone through a process known as  [[copper sheathing]]; found to be a practicable means of protecting them from [[barnacle|marine growth]] and [[biofouling|fouling]] as well as salt water corrosion. The result of this was that their speed and sailing performance as a whole in good wind improved dramatically.<ref name=\"Lavery\">Lavery p. 144-45</ref>\n\nBetween 9 April 1782 and 12 April 1782 a British fleet under Admiral [[George Brydges Rodney, 1st Baron Rodney|George Brydges Rodney]] engaged and defeated a French fleet under the [[Fran\u00e7ois Joseph Paul de Grasse|Comte de Grasse]] at the [[battle of the Saintes]], thus frustrating French plans for an invasion of [[Jamaica]]. Rear-Admiral Sir Samuel Hood fought under Rodney during the battle, and was deeply critical of his commander for not pushing home his victory against the retreating enemy fleet. The British fleet made its way to Jamaica, from where Rodney ordered Hood to seek out any disabled or damaged French ships that had escaped the battle. Hood's division of thirteen ships set out towards toward [[San Domingo]], and while travelling through the Mona Passage, came across a number of French ships which had become separated before the battle of the Saintes and were on their way to [[Cap-Fran\u00e7ais]].<ref>Harvey p.530</ref>\n\nBy the end of 1782 the French had been on defensive in the Caribbean, which signalled a stalemate of the seas.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Mahan|first1=Alfred Thayer|title=The Major Operations of the Navies in the War of American Independence|date=2013|publisher=BoD \u2013 Books on Demand|isbn=9783954273393|pages=225\u20136|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=VHePQBiqqckC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Major+Operations+of+the+Navies+in+the+War+of+Independence&hl=en&sa=X&ei=dN8iVML2AsGe7gaVi4C4Ag&ved=0CCkQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=Major%20Operations%20of%20the%20Navies%20in%20the%20War%20of%20Independence&f=false|accessdate=24 September 2014}}</ref> Soon after, the Royal navy was conducting a [[blockade]] off [[Cap-Ha\u00eftien|Cap Francois]] and [[Fort Royal]] as well as keeping a watch off [[Havana]].<ref>Marley p. 175</ref> At the same time British frigates were battling both Spanish and French [[privateer]]s.<ref>{{cite book|title=Publications of the Navy Records Society, Volume 35|date=1908|publisher=Navy Records Society|page=264|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=u5pSEFrTC78C&q=blockade+cap+francois+1782&dq=blockade+cap+francois+1782&hl=en&sa=X&ei=bvQrVLbGG-GV7AaxxoDYDg&ved=0CEkQ6AEwBw}}</ref>\n\n==East Indies Campaign, 1782\u20131783==\n\n[[Pierre Andr\u00e9 de Suffren Saint-Tropez|Suffren]], an aggressive fighter and seeker of decisive action, foiled a British attempt to take the Cape in early 1781, [[Battle of Porto Praya|attacking]] a Royal Navy squadron at [[Porto Praya]] in the [[Cape Verde Islands]] which are in the Atlantic about 450 miles west of [[Africa]].

At sea, Suffren fought five intense and hard contested battles against the British East Indies Fleet during 1782 and 1783. [[Vice Admiral]] [[Edward Hughes (Royal Navy officer)|Edward Hughes]] was aware that the French purpose was objectived at dislocating the British economic exploitation and military domination, and that the preservation of his squadron was crucial for the survival of the British presence in India.{{sfn|Richmond|1931|pp=183 ff., 302, 378-9}}{{sfn|Rodger|2005|p=356-7}} The two equally capable and determined fleets broke off their mutual challenge only when news arrived that peace treaties had been signed by Britain, France and Spain in early 1783.{{sfn|Reeve|2009|p=92}}\n\n==Peace proposal and the end of the war==\n{{main|Peace of Paris (1783)}}\n\nOver the next few weeks, serious negotiations began between Britain, France and Spain (for which Britain's chief negotiator was Alleyne Fitzherbert, and Spain's  [[Pedro Pablo Abarca de Bolea, Count of Aranda|Count of Aranda]]). Although a [[Hudson Bay Expedition|French naval expedition]] had destroyed British trading posts in [[Hudson Bay]] during the summer, no territory had actually been captured. From time to time, news would arrive from [[India]] of continuing stalemate, both in the land wars (which involved the French only as supporters to local rulers) and in naval battles; the British still appeared to hold all the French territory there that they had captured in 1778\u201379, while the French held no British territory. In the West Indies, on the other hand, the French still held all the territory they had captured, while the British held only one French island, [[St. Lucia]].\n\nIn the preliminary treaties signed with France and Spain on 20 January 1783, France and Britain returned to each other nearly all the territories they had taken from each other since 1778, except for [[Tobago]], which the French had captured in 1781 and were allowed to keep. France also gained some territory around the [[Senegal]] River in Africa which it had lost to Britain in 1763. The whole arrangement for fishing around the Newfoundland coast had to be renegotiated because of the rights awarded to the Americans.\n\n==Historians' perceptions==\n\nIn [[Alfred Thayer Mahan]]'s view, British strategy had been fundamentally flawed. By necessarily needing large and substantial contingents at home to prevent invasion by France and to protect converging trade routes while sending detachments to other war theatres, Great Britain exposed its military forces to defeat in detail. The best policy, in his opinion, {{quote|to be effective, calls for superior numbers, because the different divisions are too far apart for mutual support. Each must therefore be equal to any probable combination against it, which implies superiority everywhere to the force of the enemy actually opposed, as the latter may be unexpectedly reinforced. How impossible and dangerous such a defensive strategy is, when not superior in force, is shown by the frequent inferiority of the English abroad, as well as in Europe, despite the effort to be everywhere equal.<ref>Alfred Thayer Mahan, ''The Influence of Sea Power upon History, 1660\u20131783'' (Boston:Little, Brown, 1890), p. 534</ref>}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|5}}\n\n==References==\n*{{cite book|ref=harv|last=Ayling|first=Stanley Edward|title=George the Third|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NWdnAAAAMAAJ|year=1972|publisher=Collins|location=London}}\n*{{cite book|ref=harv|last1=Barros|first1=Carolyn A.|last2=Smith|first2=Johanna M.|title=Life-writings by British Women, 1660\u20131815: An Anthology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=blLFwTSeOmcC|accessdate=17 February 2016|year=2000|publisher=UPNE|isbn=978-1-55553-432-5}}\n*Berenger, Jean.
