[[Sima Yi]], a general of the state of [[Cao Wei]], led a force of 40,000 troops to attack the warlord [[Gongsun Yuan]], whose clan had ruled independently from the central government for three generations in the northeastern territory of [[Liaodong Commandery|Liaodong]] (present-day eastern [[Liaoning]]). After a siege that lasted three months, Gongsun Yuan's headquarters fell to Sima Yi with assistance from [[Goguryeo]] (one of the [[Three Kingdoms of Korea]]), and many who served the Gongsun clan were massacred. In addition to eliminating Wei's rival in the northeast, the acquisition of Liaodong as a result of the successful campaign allowed Wei contact with the non-Han peoples of [[Manchuria]], the [[Korean Peninsula]], and the [[Japanese archipelago]]. On the other hand, the war and the subsequent centralisation policies lessened the Chinese grip on the territory, which permitted a number of non-Han states to form in the area in later centuries.\n\n==Background==\n[[Liaodong Commandery]] of [[You Province]], part of present-day [[Manchuria]], was situated at the northeastern fringe of [[Han dynasty|Eastern Han China]], surrounded by the [[Wuhuan]] and [[Xianbei]] nomads in the north and [[Goguryeo]] and [[Buyeo kingdom|Buyeo]] peoples in the east. In the autumn of 189, [[Gongsun Du]], a native of Liaodong, was appointed as the Administrator of Liaodong (\u907c\u6771\u592a\u5b88), and thus began the Gongsun family's rule in the region. Taking advantage of his distance from central China, Gongsun Du stayed away from the chaos which accompanied the [[End of Han Dynasty|effective end of Han rule]], expanded his territories to include the commanderies of [[Lelang Commandery|Lelang]] and [[Xuantu Commandery|Xuantu]], and eventually proclaimed himself as Marquis of Liaodong (\u907c\u6771\u4faf).<ref>Gardiner (1972A), pp. 64-77</ref> His son [[Gongsun Kang]], who succeeded him in 204, created the [[Daifang Commandery]] and maintained the autonomy of Liaodong by aligning himself with the warlord [[Cao Cao]].<ref>Gardiner (1972A), p. 91</ref> Gongsun Kang died some time around the abdication of [[Emperor Xian of Han]] to [[Cao Pi]], son of Cao Cao, and Gongsun Kang's brother [[Gongsun Gong]] became the new ruler of Liaodong. Gongsun Gong was described as incompetent and inept, and he was soon overthrown and imprisoned by Gongsun Kang's second son [[Gongsun Yuan]] in 228.<ref name=\"g147\">Gardiner (1972B), p. 147</ref>\n\nSoon after Gongsun Yuan came to power in Liaodong, China was, for the most part, split into three: [[Cao Wei]] in the north, [[Shu Han]] in the southwest, and [[Eastern Wu]] in the southeast. Of these, Liaodong's chief concern was its immediate neighbour Cao Wei, who had once contemplated an invasion of Liaodong in response to Gongsun Yuan's coup.<ref name=\"g147\" /> In this situation, the Eastern Wu lord [[Sun Quan]] attempted to win Gongsun Yuan's allegiance in order to establish two fronts of attack against Cao Wei, and several embassies made their way from Wu to Liaodong by taking the difficult journey across the [[Yellow Sea]]. Cao Wei eventually got wind of the embassies and made one successful interception in Chengshan (\u6210\u5c71), at the tip of the [[Shandong peninsula]], but Gongsun Yuan had already sided with Sun Quan.<ref>Gardiner (1972B), pp. 151-152</ref> Upon the confirmation of Gongsun Yuan's goodwill, an elated Sun Quan sent another embassy in 233 to bestow Gongsun Yuan the title of King of Yan (\u71d5\u738b) and various insignia to trade for warhorses. By then, however, Gongsun Yuan had changed his mind about allying himself with a distant state over the sea and making himself an enemy of a powerful neighbour. When the Wu embassy arrived, Gongsun Yuan seized the treasures, killed the leading ambassadors, and sent their heads and a portion of their goods to the Wei court to buy himself back to favour.<ref>Gardiner (1972B), p. 154</ref> Some of the envoys from Wu somehow escaped the carnage and found a potential ally to the east of Liaodong \u2014 the state of Goguryeo.\n\nGoguryeo had been an enemy of the Gongsun clan since the time of Gongsun Du, especially after Gongsun Kang meddled with the succession after [[Gogukcheon of Goguryeo|King Gogukcheon]] died. Thus when the Wu ambassadors came to Goguryeo for refuge, the reigning [[Dongcheon of Goguryeo|King Dongcheon]] was happy to assist these new enemies of Liaodong. The king sent 25 men to escort the envoys back to Wu along with a tribute of [[sable]] and [[falcon]] skins, which encouraged Sun Quan to send an official mission to Goguryeo to further the two states' relations. Cao Wei did not want to see Wu regain a diplomatic foothold in the north, and established its own connections with Goguryeo through the Inspector of You Province (\u5e7d\u5dde\u523a\u53f2) Wang Xiong (\u738b\u96c4).<ref>Gardiner (1972B), p. 162</ref> King Dongcheon presumably arrived at the same conclusion as Gongsun Yuan and switched his alignment from Wu to Wei \u2014 the Wu envoys to Goguryeo in 236 were executed and their heads sent to the new Inspector of You Province, [[Guanqiu Jian]]. For the moment, both Liaodong and Goguryeo were aligned with Wei while Wu's influence diminished.\n\n==Prelude==\nAlthough Gongsun Yuan was nominally a vassal of Cao Wei, his brief flirtation with Wu and brazen derogatory comments about Wei earned him a reputation as unreliable. From Wei's point of view, although the Xianbei insurrection by [[Kebineng]] had been put down recently, Liaodong's position as a buffer zone against barbarian invasions needed to be clarified.<ref>Gardiner (1972B), p. 149</ref>  Therefore, it was clearly unacceptable that its leader, Gongsun Yuan, was of questionable loyalty. In 237, Guanqiu Jian presented a plan to invade Liaodong to the Wei imperial court and put his plan into action. With troops of You Province as well as Wuhuan and Xianbei auxiliaries, Guanqiu Jian crossed the [[Liao River]] east into Gongsun Yuan's territory and clashed with his enemy in Liaosui (\u907c\u96a7; near present-day [[Haicheng, Liaoning|Haicheng]], [[Liaoning]]). There the Wei forces suffered a defeat, and were forced to retreat due to the floods caused by the summer monsoon season.<ref>Gardiner (1972B), p. 166</ref>\n\nHaving inflicted a disgrace on the imperial armies, Gongsun Yuan had gone too far to turn back. In a series of contradictory actions that bear the hallmark of panic, Gongsun Yuan memorialised the Wei court in hope of getting a pardon on one hand, while formally declaring independence on the other by assuming the title King of Yan. He also assigned an [[Chinese era name|era name]] for his reign, Shaohan (\u7d39\u6f22), meaning \"Succeeding Han\". This was problematic for his peace efforts for two reasons: first, proclaiming era names was a practice usually reserved for emperors, showing his intention to claim the imperial position; secondly, the era name itself implied that Wei's succession of the Han dynasty was somehow illegitimate. As king, he tried to entice the Xianbei into attacking Cao Wei by conferring the rank of [[chanyu]] to one of its chiefs, but the Xianbei had not recovered from the death of Kebineng: the chieftains were too preoccupied with internal disputes to launch a large-scale attack on Wei.<ref>Gardiner (1972B), p. 167</ref>\n\nIn 238, the Wei court summoned the Grand Commandant (\u592a\u5c09) [[Sima Yi]] for another campaign against Gongsun Yuan. Previously, Sima Yi had been tasked with defending Wei's western borders from Shu Han's [[Zhuge Liang's Northern Expeditions|Northern Expeditions]] led by the Shu [[Chancellor (China)|chancellor]] [[Zhuge Liang]], so when the latter died in 234, the government of Wei became able to afford sending Sima Yi to another frontier.<ref name=\"b168\" /> In a court debate prior to the campaign, the Wei [[Emperor of China|emperor]] [[Cao Rui]] decided that Sima Yi should lead 40,000 men for the invasion of Liaodong. Some counsellors thought the number was too many, but Cao Rui overruled them, saying: \"In this expedition of 4,000 ''[[Li (unit)|li]]'', mobile troops must be employed, and we must exert our utmost. We should not mind the expense at all.\"<ref>Fang, p. 569</ref> The emperor then asked Sima Yi for his assessment on Gongsun Yuan's possible reactions and how long the campaign should take, Sima Yi responded as thus: {{quote|To leave his walls behind and take to flight would be the best plan for Gongsun Yuan. To take his position in Liaodong and resist our large forces would be the next best. But if he stays in [the Liaodong capital] Xiangping (\u8944\u5e73; present-day [[Liaoyang]]) and defends it, he will be captured... Only a man of insight and wisdom is able to weigh his own and the enemy's relative strength, and so give up something beforehand. But this is not something Gongsun Yuan can do. On the contrary, he will think that our army, alone and on a long-distance expedition, cannot long keep it up. He is certain to offer resistance on the [[Liao River]] first and defend Xiangping afterwards... A hundred days for going, another hundred days for the attack, still another hundred days for coming back, and sixty days for rest; thus one year is sufficient.<ref>Fang, pp. 569-570</ref><ref>(\u5929\u5b50\u66f0\uff1a\u300c\u6b64\u4e0d\u8db3\u4ee5\u52de\u541b\uff0c\u4e8b\u6b32\u5fc5\u514b\uff0c\u6545\u4ee5\u76f8\u7169\u8033\u3002\u541b\u5ea6\u5176\u4f5c\u4f55\u8a08\uff1f\u300d\u5c0d\u66f0\uff1a\u300c\u68c4\u57ce\u9810\u8d70\uff0c\u4e0a\u8a08\u4e5f\u3002\u64da\u907c\u6c34\u4ee5\u8ddd\u5927\u8ecd\uff0c\u6b21\u8a08\u4e5f\u3002\u5750\u5b88\u8944\u5e73\uff0c\u6b64\u6210\u64d2\u8033\u3002\u300d\u5929\u5b50\u66f0\uff1a\u300c\u5176\u8a08\u5c07\u5b89\u51fa\uff1f\u300d\u5c0d\u66f0\uff1a\u300c\u60df\u660e\u8005\u80fd\u6df1\u5ea6\u5f7c\u5df1\uff0c\u8c6b\u6709\u6240\u68c4\uff0c\u6b64\u975e\u5176\u6240\u53ca\u4e5f\u3002\u4eca\u61f8\u8ecd\u9060\u5f81\uff0c\u5c07\u8b02\u4e0d\u80fd\u6301\u4e45\uff0c\u5fc5\u5148\u8ddd\u907c\u6c34\u800c\u5f8c\u5b88\uff0c\u6b64\u4e2d\u4e0b\u8a08\u4e5f\u3002\u300d\u5929\u5b50\u66f0\uff1a\u300c\u5f80\u9084\u5e7e\u6642\uff1f\u300d\u5c0d\u66f0\uff1a\u300c\u5f80\u767e\u65e5\uff0c\u9084\u767e\u65e5\uff0c\u653b\u767e\u65e5\uff0c\u4ee5\u516d\u5341\u65e5\u70ba\u4f11\u606f\uff0c\u4e00\u5e74\u8db3\u77e3\u3002\u300d) ''Jin Shu'' vol. 1.</ref>}}\n\nWhen Sima Yi set out from the Wei capital [[Luoyang]], Cao Rui personally saw him off at Luoyang's Ximing Gate (\u897f\u660e\u9580), where he ordered Sima Yi's brother [[Sima Fu]] and son [[Sima Shi]], as well as other officials to attend the ceremony. Sima Yi, leading 40,000 infantry and cavalry, was accompanied by sub-commanders such as [[Niu Jin]] and [[Hu Zun]] (\u80e1\u9075).<ref>Fang, p. 585 note 1</ref><ref>(\u666f\u521d\u4e8c\u5e74\uff0c\u5e25\u725b\u91d1\u3001\u80e1\u9075\u7b49\u6b65\u9a0e\u56db\u842c\uff0c\u767c\u81ea\u4eac\u90fd\u3002\u8eca\u99d5\u9001\u51fa\u897f\u660e\u9580\uff0c\u8a54\u5f1f\u5b5a\u3001\u5b50\u5e2b\u9001\u904e\u6eab\uff0c\u8cdc\u4ee5\u7a40\u5e1b\u725b\u9152\uff0c\u52d1\u90e1\u5b88\u5178\u8fb2\u4ee5\u4e0b\u7686\u5f80\u6703\u7109\u3002) ''Jin Shu'' vol. 1.</ref> He would later be joined by Guanqiu Jian's forces in You Province,<ref>Chen, 28.5</ref> which included the Xianbei auxiliary led by [[Mohuba]] (\u83ab\u8b77\u8dcb), ancestor of the [[Murong]] clan.<ref name=\"g169\">Gardiner (1972B), p. 169</ref>\n\nHaving heard of the new preparations made against him, Gongsun Yuan desperately dispatched an envoy to the Wu court to apologise for his betrayal in 233 and begged for help from Sun Quan. At first, Sun Quan was ready to kill the messenger, but he was persuaded by Yang Dao (\u7f8a\u885c) to make a display of force and possibly gain advantages if Sima Yi and Gongsun Yuan became deadlocked in war. Cao Rui became concerned about the Wu reinforcements, but the adviser [[Jiang Ji]] read through Sun Quan's intentions and cautioned Cao Rui that while Sun Quan would not risk a deep invasion, the Wu fleet would make a shallow incursion into Liaodong if Sima Yi does not defeat Gongsun Yuan quickly enough.<ref>Fang, pp. 570-571</ref>\n\n==The campaign==\nThe Wei army led by Sima Yi reached the banks of the Liao River by June 238. and Gongsun Yuan responded by sending Bei Yan (\u5351\u884d) and Yang Zuo (\u694a\u795a) with the main Liaodong force to set camp at Liaosui, the site of Guanqiu Jian's defeat. There, the Liaodong encampment stretched some 20 ''[[Li (unit)|li]]'' walled from north to south.<ref>Fang, pp. 572, 591 note 12.2. Although the ''[[Book of Jin]]'' described the encampment as stretching 60 to 70 ''li'', [[Sima Guang]] followed the ''[[Records of the Three Kingdoms]]'' description since he considered 70 ''li'' too long for an encampment.</ref><ref>(\u6587\u61ff\u679c\u9063\u6b65\u9a0e\u6578\u842c\uff0c\u963b\u907c\u96a7\uff0c\u5805\u58c1\u800c\u5b88\uff0c\u5357\u5317\u516d\u4e03\u5341\u91cc\uff0c\u4ee5\u8ddd\u5e1d\u3002) ''Jin Shu'' vol. 1.</ref> The Wei generals wanted to attack Liaosui, but Sima Yi reasoned that attacking the encampment would only wear themselves out; on the other hand, since the bulk of the Liaodong army was at Liaosui, Gongsun Yuan's headquarters at Xiangping would be comparatively empty and the Wei armies could take it with ease. Thus Sima Yi sent Hu Zun to make a sortie to the southeast, planting flags and banners as if the main thrust of the Wei army was in that direction.<ref>Fang, p. 572</ref> Bei Yan and his men hastened to the south, where Hu Zun, having lured his enemy out, crossed the river and broke through Bei Yan's line.<ref name=\"b168\"/> Meanwhile, Sima Yi secretly led the main Wei army across the Liao River to the north. After he made the crossing, he burned the bridges and boats, made a long barricade along the river, then headed toward Xiangping.<ref>Fang, p. 592 note 13.4</ref> Realising the feint, Bei Yan and his men hastily withdrew their troops during the night and headed north to intercept Sima Yi's army. Bei Yan caught up with Sima Yi in Mount Shou (\u9996\u5c71), a mountain west of Xiangping, where he was ordered to fight to the death by Gongsun Yuan.

Rain poured constantly for more than a month so that ships could sail the length of the flooded Liao River from its mouth at the [[Liaodong Bay]] up to the walls of Xiangping. With the water several feet high on level ground, Sima Yi was determined to maintain the siege despite the clamours of his officers who proposed changing camps. Sima Yi executed Zhang Jing (\u5f35\u975c), an officer who kept bringing up the issue, and the rest of the officers became silent. Because of the floods, the encirclement of Xiangping was by no means complete, and the defenders used the flood to their advantage to sail out to forage and pasture their animals.

Many Liaodong generals, such as Yang Zuo, surrendered to Sima Yi during the siege.\n\nOn September 3, a comet was seen in the skies of Xiangping and was interpreted as an omen of destruction by those in the Liaodong camp. A frightened Gongsun Yuan sent his Chancellor of State Wang Jian (\u738b\u5efa) and Imperial Counsellor Liu Fu (\u67f3\u752b) to negotiate the terms of surrender, where he promised to present himself bound to Sima Yi once the siege was lifted.

In April or May 239, a Wu fleet commanded by Sun Yi (\u5b6b\u6021) and Yang Dao defeated the Wei defenders in southern Liaodong, prompting the Wei imperial court to evacuate the coastal population to [[Shandong]], further accelerating the trend of depopulation in Liaodong. This happened around the same time as the Xianbei chieftain Mohuba was awarded merit for his participation in the campaign against Gongsun Yuan, and his people were allowed to settle and thrive in northern Liaodong. By the beginning of the [[Jin dynasty (265\u2013420)|Western Jin dynasty]] (265-316), the number of Chinese households fell to just 5,400.<ref>Gardiner (1972B), p. 173</ref> After the fall of Western Jin, control over Liaodong was passed onto [[Former Yan]] (337-370), which was founded by Mohuba's descendants, and then to Goguryeo. For several centuries Liaodong would be out of Chinese hands, partly due to the lack of Chinese presence there as a result of the policies that Sima Yi and the Wei court adopted for Liaodong after the fall of the Gongsun.<ref>Gardiner (1972B), p. 174</ref>\n\nIn the meantime, the removal of the Gongsun regime cleared a barrier between central China and the peoples of the farther east.

[[Sima Yi]], a general of the state of [[Cao Wei]], led a force of 40,000 troops to attack the warlord [[Gongsun Yuan]], whose clan had ruled independently from the central government for three generations in the northeastern territory of [[Liaodong Commandery|Liaodong]] (present-day eastern [[Liaoning]]). After a siege that lasted three months, Gongsun Yuan's headquarters fell to Sima Yi with assistance from [[Goguryeo]] (one of the [[Three Kingdoms of Korea]]), and many who served the Gongsun clan were massacred. In addition to eliminating Wei's rival in the northeast, the acquisition of Liaodong as a result of the successful campaign allowed Wei contact with the non-Han peoples of [[Manchuria]], the [[Korean Peninsula]], and the [[Japanese archipelago]]. On the other hand, the war and the subsequent centralisation policies lessened the Chinese grip on the territory, which permitted a number of non-Han states to form in the area in later centuries.\n\n==Background==\n[[Liaodong Commandery]] of [[You Province]], part of present-day [[Manchuria]], was situated at the northeastern fringe of [[Han dynasty|Eastern Han China]], surrounded by the [[Wuhuan]] and [[Xianbei]] nomads in the north and [[Goguryeo]] and [[Buyeo kingdom|Buyeo]] peoples in the east. In the autumn of 189, [[Gongsun Du]], a native of Liaodong, was appointed as the Administrator of Liaodong (\u907c\u6771\u592a\u5b88), and thus began the Gongsun family's rule in the region. Taking advantage of his distance from central China, Gongsun Du stayed away from the chaos which accompanied the [[End of Han Dynasty|effective end of Han rule]], expanded his territories to include the commanderies of [[Lelang Commandery|Lelang]] and [[Xuantu Commandery|Xuantu]], and eventually proclaimed himself as Marquis of Liaodong (\u907c\u6771\u4faf).<ref>Gardiner (1972A), pp. 64-77</ref> His son [[Gongsun Kang]], who succeeded him in 204, created the [[Daifang Commandery]] and maintained the autonomy of Liaodong by aligning himself with the warlord [[Cao Cao]].<ref>Gardiner (1972A), p. 91</ref> Gongsun Kang died some time around the abdication of [[Emperor Xian of Han]] to [[Cao Pi]], son of Cao Cao, and Gongsun Kang's brother [[Gongsun Gong]] became the new ruler of Liaodong. Gongsun Gong was described as incompetent and inept, and he was soon overthrown and imprisoned by Gongsun Kang's second son [[Gongsun Yuan]] in 228.<ref name=\"g147\">Gardiner (1972B), p. 147</ref>\n\nSoon after Gongsun Yuan came to power in Liaodong, China was, for the most part, split into three: [[Cao Wei]] in the north, [[Shu Han]] in the southwest, and [[Eastern Wu]] in the southeast. Of these, Liaodong's chief concern was its immediate neighbour Cao Wei, who had once contemplated an invasion of Liaodong in response to Gongsun Yuan's coup.<ref name=\"g147\" /> In this situation, the Eastern Wu lord [[Sun Quan]] attempted to win Gongsun Yuan's allegiance in order to establish two fronts of attack against Cao Wei, and several embassies made their way from Wu to Liaodong by taking the difficult journey across the [[Yellow Sea]]. Cao Wei eventually got wind of the embassies and made one successful interception in Chengshan (\u6210\u5c71), at the tip of the [[Shandong peninsula]], but Gongsun Yuan had already sided with Sun Quan.<ref>Gardiner (1972B), pp. 151-152</ref> Upon the confirmation of Gongsun Yuan's goodwill, an elated Sun Quan sent another embassy in 233 to bestow Gongsun Yuan the title of King of Yan (\u71d5\u738b) and various insignia to trade for warhorses. By then, however, Gongsun Yuan had changed his mind about allying himself with a distant state over the sea and making himself an enemy of a powerful neighbour. When the Wu embassy arrived, Gongsun Yuan seized the treasures, killed the leading ambassadors, and sent their heads and a portion of their goods to the Wei court to buy himself back to favour.<ref>Gardiner (1972B), p. 154</ref> Some of the envoys from Wu somehow escaped the carnage and found a potential ally to the east of Liaodong \u2014 the state of Goguryeo.\n\nGoguryeo had been an enemy of the Gongsun clan since the time of Gongsun Du, especially after Gongsun Kang meddled with the succession after [[Gogukcheon of Goguryeo|King Gogukcheon]] died. Thus when the Wu ambassadors came to Goguryeo for refuge, the reigning [[Dongcheon of Goguryeo|King Dongcheon]] was happy to assist these new enemies of Liaodong. The king sent 25 men to escort the envoys back to Wu along with a tribute of [[sable]] and [[falcon]] skins, which encouraged Sun Quan to send an official mission to Goguryeo to further the two states' relations. Cao Wei did not want to see Wu regain a diplomatic foothold in the north, and established its own connections with Goguryeo through the Inspector of You Province (\u5e7d\u5dde\u523a\u53f2) Wang Xiong (\u738b\u96c4).<ref>Gardiner (1972B), p. 162</ref> King Dongcheon presumably arrived at the same conclusion as Gongsun Yuan and switched his alignment from Wu to Wei \u2014 the Wu envoys to Goguryeo in 236 were executed and their heads sent to the new Inspector of You Province, [[Guanqiu Jian]]. For the moment, both Liaodong and Goguryeo were aligned with Wei while Wu's influence diminished.\n\n==Prelude==\nAlthough Gongsun Yuan was nominally a vassal of Cao Wei, his brief flirtation with Wu and brazen derogatory comments about Wei earned him a reputation as unreliable. From Wei's point of view, although the Xianbei insurrection by [[Kebineng]] had been put down recently, Liaodong's position as a buffer zone against barbarian invasions needed to be clarified.<ref>Gardiner (1972B), p. 149</ref>  Therefore, it was clearly unacceptable that its leader, Gongsun Yuan, was of questionable loyalty. In 237, Guanqiu Jian presented a plan to invade Liaodong to the Wei imperial court and put his plan into action. With troops of You Province as well as Wuhuan and Xianbei auxiliaries, Guanqiu Jian crossed the [[Liao River]] east into Gongsun Yuan's territory and clashed with his enemy in Liaosui (\u907c\u96a7; near present-day [[Haicheng, Liaoning|Haicheng]], [[Liaoning]]). There the Wei forces suffered a defeat, and were forced to retreat due to the floods caused by the summer monsoon season.<ref>Gardiner (1972B), p. 166</ref>\n\nHaving inflicted a disgrace on the imperial armies, Gongsun Yuan had gone too far to turn back. In a series of contradictory actions that bear the hallmark of panic, Gongsun Yuan memorialised the Wei court in hope of getting a pardon on one hand, while formally declaring independence on the other by assuming the title King of Yan. He also assigned an [[Chinese era name|era name]] for his reign, Shaohan (\u7d39\u6f22), meaning \"Succeeding Han\". This was problematic for his peace efforts for two reasons: first, proclaiming era names was a practice usually reserved for emperors, showing his intention to claim the imperial position; secondly, the era name itself implied that Wei's succession of the Han dynasty was somehow illegitimate. As king, he tried to entice the Xianbei into attacking Cao Wei by conferring the rank of [[chanyu]] to one of its chiefs, but the Xianbei had not recovered from the death of Kebineng: the chieftains were too preoccupied with internal disputes to launch a large-scale attack on Wei.<ref>Gardiner (1972B), p. 167</ref>\n\nIn 238, the Wei court summoned the Grand Commandant (\u592a\u5c09) [[Sima Yi]] for another campaign against Gongsun Yuan. Previously, Sima Yi had been tasked with defending Wei's western borders from Shu Han's [[Zhuge Liang's Northern Expeditions|Northern Expeditions]] led by the Shu [[Chancellor (China)|chancellor]] [[Zhuge Liang]], so when the latter died in 234, the government of Wei became able to afford sending Sima Yi to another frontier.<ref name=\"b168\" /> In a court debate prior to the campaign, the Wei [[Emperor of China|emperor]] [[Cao Rui]] decided that Sima Yi should lead 40,000 men for the invasion of Liaodong. Some counsellors thought the number was too many, but Cao Rui overruled them, saying: \"In this expedition of 4,000 ''[[Li (unit)|li]]'', mobile troops must be employed, and we must exert our utmost. We should not mind the expense at all.\"<ref>Fang, p. 569</ref> The emperor then asked Sima Yi for his assessment on Gongsun Yuan's possible reactions and how long the campaign should take, Sima Yi responded as thus: {{quote|To leave his walls behind and take to flight would be the best plan for Gongsun Yuan. To take his position in Liaodong and resist our large forces would be the next best. But if he stays in [the Liaodong capital] Xiangping (\u8944\u5e73; present-day [[Liaoyang]]) and defends it, he will be captured... Only a man of insight and wisdom is able to weigh his own and the enemy's relative strength, and so give up something beforehand. But this is not something Gongsun Yuan can do. On the contrary, he will think that our army, alone and on a long-distance expedition, cannot long keep it up. He is certain to offer resistance on the [[Liao River]] first and defend Xiangping afterwards...

At first, Sun Quan was ready to kill the messenger, but he was persuaded by Yang Dao (\u7f8a\u885c) to make a display of force and possibly gain advantages if Sima Yi and Gongsun Yuan became deadlocked in war. Cao Rui became concerned about the Wu reinforcements, but the adviser [[Jiang Ji]] read through Sun Quan's intentions and cautioned Cao Rui that while Sun Quan would not risk a deep invasion, the Wu fleet would make a shallow incursion into Liaodong if Sima Yi does not defeat Gongsun Yuan quickly enough.<ref>Fang, pp. 570-571</ref>\n\n==The campaign==\nThe Wei army led by Sima Yi reached the banks of the Liao River by June 238. and Gongsun Yuan responded by sending Bei Yan (\u5351\u884d) and Yang Zuo (\u694a\u795a) with the main Liaodong force to set camp at Liaosui, the site of Guanqiu Jian's defeat. There, the Liaodong encampment stretched some 20 ''[[Li (unit)|li]]'' walled from north to south.<ref>Fang, pp. 572, 591 note 12.2.

Thus Sima Yi sent Hu Zun to make a sortie to the southeast, planting flags and banners as if the main thrust of the Wei army was in that direction.<ref>Fang, p. 572</ref> Bei Yan and his men hastened to the south, where Hu Zun, having lured his enemy out, crossed the river and broke through Bei Yan's line.<ref name=\"b168\"/> Meanwhile, Sima Yi secretly led the main Wei army across the Liao River to the north.

Sima Yi executed Zhang Jing (\u5f35\u975c), an officer who kept bringing up the issue, and the rest of the officers became silent.

In April or May 239, a Wu fleet commanded by Sun Yi (\u5b6b\u6021) and Yang Dao defeated the Wei defenders in southern Liaodong, prompting the Wei imperial court to evacuate the coastal population to [[Shandong]], further accelerating the trend of depopulation in Liaodong. This happened around the same time as the Xianbei chieftain Mohuba was awarded merit for his participation in the campaign against Gongsun Yuan, and his people were allowed to settle and thrive in northern Liaodong. By the beginning of the [[Jin dynasty (265\u2013420)|Western Jin dynasty]] (265-316), the number of Chinese households fell to just 5,400.<ref>Gardiner (1972B), p. 173</ref> After the fall of Western Jin, control over Liaodong was passed onto [[Former Yan]] (337-370), which was founded by Mohuba's descendants, and then to Goguryeo. For several centuries Liaodong would be out of Chinese hands, partly due to the lack of Chinese presence there as a result of the policies that Sima Yi and the Wei court adopted for Liaodong after the fall of the Gongsun.<ref>Gardiner (1972B), p. 174</ref>\n\nIn the meantime, the removal of the Gongsun regime cleared a barrier between central China and the peoples of the farther east. As early as 239, a mission from the [[Wa (Japan)|Wa people]] of Japan under Queen [[Himiko]] reached the Wei court for the first time.<ref>Gardiner (1972B), p. 175-176</ref> Goguryeo soon found itself rid of a nuisance that was only to be replaced by a stronger neighbour, and provoked Wei's wrath when it raided Chinese settlements in Liaodong and [[Xuantu Commandery|Xuantu]] commanderies. The [[Goguryeo\u2013Wei Wars]] of 244 followed, devastating Goguryeo, and from it the Chinese re-established friendly contact with the Buyeo.<ref name=\"last\">Gardiner (1972B), p. 175</ref> These developments could only have happened after Sima Yi's conquest of Liaodong, which, in some sense, represented the first step in recovering Chinese influence in the farther east at the time.<ref name=\"last\" />\n\n==In popular culture==\nThe Liaodong campaign is featured as a playable stage in the [[Dynasty Warriors 7|seventh instalment]] of [[Koei]]'s ''[[Dynasty Warriors]]'' video game series in the newly introduced Jin Dynasty story line.\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n==References==\n* [[Chen Shou|Chen, Shou]].

His first job was in 1928, as a functionary at the Tighina school inspectorate. For the following eight years, he was a tutor and substitute teacher at the commercial school and the apprentices' school in Ia\u015fi. From 1929 to 1931, he attended [[Politehnica University of Bucharest]] sporadically, but did not graduate.<ref name=\"dragia\"/> From 1933 to 1937, he attended the Political Economy section of the [[University of Ia\u015fi]] Law faculty, receiving his doctorate in 1940, having worked as university assistant under [[Gheorghe Zane]] for the preceding three years.<ref name=\"dragia\"/><ref name=\"razboi\"/> Generally thought to have joined the banned [[Romanian Communist Party]] (PCR) in 1943, other sources place the date at 1935. In either case, the student environment at Ia\u015fi had drawn him into communist circles by 1933. Between 1934 and 1936 he headed the communist-inspired student organization \"United Centers\", worked on the leftist newspaper ''Manifest'', and was an active member of the Antifascist League, the Tighina Antifascist Committee and ''[[Amicii URSS]]''. In 1936, he was also in the leadership of the Ia\u015fi section of the Student Democratic Front.<ref name=\"dragia\"/>\n\nThe June 1940 [[Soviet occupation of Bessarabia and Northern Bukovina|Soviet occupation]] of Bessarabia found him on vacation there; he chose to remain and become a Soviet citizen. In September 1940 he began working at the Institute for Scientific Research in [[Chi\u015fin\u0103u]], forced to flee in June 1941 following the province's [[Operation Barbarossa|recapture]] by Romania. Ending up in the [[Karaganda]] area, for nearly two years he was a teacher, school director, miner and party activist on a [[kolkhoz]], until being sent to [[Moscow]] in 1943 to resume his studies.<ref name=\"dragia\"/> An active member of the Romanian communist exile circle in the Soviet Union during [[World War II]],<ref name=\"crime\"/> he worked in the Romanian-language division of [[Voice of Russia|Radio Moscow]] (1943\u20131945); contributed to [[Telegraph Agency of the Soviet Union|TASS]] and to ''Graiul liber'', the newspaper of Romanian prisoners in the Soviet Union (1943\u20131946); and was a teacher at the Romanian section of the anti-fascist school for prisoners (1944\u20131946), heading it in 1945. A member of the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union]], he undertook the latter task as a party employee, helping indoctrinate Romanian prisoners.

A founding queen searches for a hollow tree, wall cavity, rock crevice, or even a mammal-made hole to build a nest. One colony cycle lasts for about 6\u201311 months and each colony cycle consists of around 3000\u20138000 larvae.\n\nThe extraordinary adaptation skills of ''V. vulgaris'' enable it to live in a wide range of habitats, from very humid areas to artificial environments such as gardens and human structures. This species, along with other wasp species such as ''V. germanica'', has impacted the ecosystem, especially those in New Zealand and Australia, where they were imported by humans, and frequently cause damage to fruit crops and endanger humans.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite journal |url= |title=Variation in Colour Marking of German Wasps Vespula germanica (F.) and Common Wasps Vespula vulgaris (L.)

It has [[aposematic]] colors of black and yellow; yellow pronotal bands which are almost parallel to each other and black dots and rings on its abdomen. The queens and females appear very similar to ''[[Vespula germanica]]''), except when they are seen head on, as the ''V. vulgaris'' face lacks the three black dots of ''V. germanica''. Instead, each has only one black mark on its [[Clypeus (arthropod anatomy)|''clypeus'']], which is usually anchor or dagger-shaped. However, identification of this species may be difficult because the black mark on its ''clypeus'' can sometimes appear broken, making it again look similar to ''V. germanica''.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\nStill more difficult to distinguish between species are the males. Almost undetectable with the naked eye, the only confident identification of ''V. vulgaris'' males is to seek the distinct ''[[aedeagus]]'' tip shapes and lateral processes of their [[genitalia]].<ref name=\":1\"/>\n\n==Distribution and habitat==\n''V. vulgaris'' is a [[Palearctic]] species.<ref name=\"digitallibrary.amnh.org\"/> It was discovered in a wide range of countries, including the United Kingdom, Germany, India, and China. It is invasive in New Zealand and Australia.<ref name=\":3\" /> Until 2010, it was thought to be in North America as well, but molecular and morphological data showed that specimens identified as ''V. vulgaris'' in North America were ''Vespula alascensis'', which had previously been considered a taxonomic synonym, but is now considered a separate species.<ref name=\"digitallibrary.amnh.org\"/>\n\n''V. vulgaris'' has high adaptation skills for environments. It flourishes in most types of habitats, including prairie, grassland, natural and planted forests, shrub lands, and even in urban zones such as gardens, orchards, and buildings. However, it does require the temperature to be moderately warm, because its [[foraging]] activity is temperature-dependent (above 2 \u00b0C).<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n==Northern Hemisphere colony cycle==\nFive distinguishable stages occur in ''V. vulgaris'' colony cycle in the temperate parts of the [[Northern Hemisphere]]. Each lasts for similar periods, around 30\u201335 days. The colony starts in April as the queen begins the foundation of the nest and degenerates around October when the temperature drops and the queen dies. The size of the colony ranges from 3000 [[larvae]] up to a maximum of 8000 larvae, with the queen producing around 200\u2013300 eggs per day for 24 days.<ref name=\":5\">{{cite book |last1=Potter |first1=N.B. |title=A Study of the Biology of the Common Wasp, ''Vespula vulgaris'' L., with Special Reference to the Foraging Behavior |date=1964 |publisher=University of Bristol |location=Bristol |pages=5\u201360}}</ref>\n\n*Stage 1 \u2013 solitary stage: the queen builds the nest, provisions the cells and rears the first brood of workers.\n*Stage 2 \u2013 rapid increase: the workers replace the queen as the foraging force. The queen is now a nurse and egg producer. There is very rapid buildup of worker population.\n*Stage 3 \u2013 slow increase: the rate of population growth is not as rapid as in stage 2.\n*Stage 4 \u2013 climax of colony: worker population no longer increases. Cells built are all queen cells. Males emerge, and foraging rate per worker increases.\n*Stage 5 \u2013 decline: probably caused by death or sickness of queen. Colony cohesion breaks down, cannibalism sets in, and the foraging becomes erratic.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\n==Brood production==\nThe general incubation period is five days, but it can occasionally be seven, due to [[cannibalism]], [[scavenging]] or replacement. The larval period can depend on the trophic condition inside and outside the nest. If there are abundant resources of food being brought into the nest, the larval period is short, but if the resource is short, the period can lengthen. The first adult emerges after around 23 days of hatching and the queen-pupated brood is completed in about a month (30 days).<ref name=\":5\" />\n\nThe first brood of workers are all of normal size, but the next generation of them is generally smaller, due to a decrease in the queen's foraging activity after producing the first batch of larvae. As the queen's foraging decreases, the second group of workers does not get so much food, often starves, and so spends more time in the larval stage.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\n==Nest foundation by the queen==\nAfter coming out of hibernation in the spring, the queen forages for flowers or shrubs and begins looking for nesting sites. She flies low on the ground, searching for any round, dark object or depression. If it is a hole, she flies in to inspect the details if it is suitable and if not moves on to the next hole. What constitutes a \"perfect\" nest is yet to be discovered, but it is mainly speculated that the queen's physiological state is the main deciding factor of the time and the place of nesting. When she has found a suitable site for nesting, she performs dance-like wing movements which allow her to locate the site even after she has left the area.<ref name=\":6\">{{cite journal |last1=M. V |first1=Brian |last2=A.

She repeats the procedure of bringing in a pulp, attaching it to the nest to form a [[wikt:spindle|spindle]] and flying back out to bring in more pulp. During this process, the queen clings to the nest with her two [[Posterior (anatomy)|posterior]] pairs of legs and attaches the pulp using her [[anterior]] legs and mouth parts.<ref name=\":5\" /> She builds 20\u201330 cells before initial egg-laying, fashioning a [[Petiole (insect)|petiole]] and producing a single cell at the end of it. Six further cells are then added around this to produce the characteristic hexagonal shape of the nest cells. One egg is laid in each cell, and as it hatches, each larva holds itself in the vertical cell by pressing its body against the sides.<ref name=\"TeAra\" />\n\nWhen the nest is completed, the queen is replaced by the workers as the foraging force and instead is now concerned only with nursing and egg producing. Her ovaries develop, her abdomen becomes distended with eggs, and she loses the ability to fly.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\nAfter the founding phase has been completed, the colony encounters a change where the workers begin to build queen cells. Once the workers start building on the queen cells, no more worker cells are built, but those that still have brood growing in them are retained. The majority of the food resource brought in by the workers is fed to the queen larvae, known as [[gynes]] and the lack of feeding for other larvae causes the prolongation of their larval periods.<ref name=\":6\" /> To ensure that only the queen's eggs are reared to adulthood, female workers remove worker-laid eggs in a process known as [[worker policing]].\n\nWhen the queen has completed her job of producing daughter queen larvae, she dies, leaving a crop of virgin queens which will leave the nest, mate, hibernate, and reproduce in the following spring. After the queen's death, the coordination of the colony breaks down and the workers begin to lay eggs. The rate and amount of foraging decrease drastically after the queen's death, so it is unable to support all the workers and their brood. This is when [[cannibalism]] occurs among the workers and furthermore, the workers tear off their cells and carry them out of the nest, dropping the temperature of the entire nest. Once this stage is reached, the remaining workers die of cold or starvation.<ref name=\":11\">{{cite journal |last1=R. J. |first1=Harris |last2=J.

Aerial nests and nests that are very close to the surface of the ground have much thicker envelopes than those under the ground. The wasps build thick envelopes to prevent heat from escaping. Also, smaller nests have thicker envelopes than larger nests. This is mainly due to the fact that the amount of heat produced is proportional to the volume of the nest. The larger a nest is the better it will be in conserving the nest warmth. The optimal temperature of the nest is around 32&nbsp;\u00b0C. However, when the temperature rises above the optimal temperature (during hot days), the workers use their wings as fans to cool the nest down.<ref name=\":8\">{{cite journal |last1=R. |first1=Sailer |title=Nest temperature in the common yellow-jacket |journal=Journal of the Kansas Entomological Society |date=1950 |volume=23 |pages=134\u2013137}}</ref>\n\n''V. vulgaris'' wasps recognize their nests by making [[pheromone]] trails from the entrance of their nest to the site of foraging.

This difference is due mainly to the variation in prey. ''Vespula vulgaris'' food sources are greatly affected by the temperature, while those of ''Vespula germanica'' are not, providing them with a much higher chance of survival even during the winter.<ref name=\":7\" /> Because many ''Vespula germanica'' are able to overwinter and most ''Vespula vulgaris'' do not, except for the queen, this affects the nest size of the two species. ''Vespula germanica'' generally have slightly bigger nest size (3500\u20139000 larvae in one colony cycle) than ''Vespula vulgaris'' (3000\u20138000 larvae in one colony cycle).<ref>{{cite journal |last1=B.

She flies frontwards and backwards in front of the nest with a slow, hovering flight and repeats this movement until its distance is further away from the hole. When the arc of the flight increases up to about 6 ft (183 cm), the pathway makes a figure of a sideways \"8\" and when the queen is about 60 ft (18 m) away from the nest site, she then flies in a straight line. This is how the queen ''Vespula vulgaris'' marks the land, in respect to the landmarks around the nesting site.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\n===Defensive behaviors===\nOnly wasps leaving the nest notice a disturbance and defend or fight off an intruder. The ones returning to the nest do not detect any disturbance and try to enter the nest. The workers that detect danger show a certain gesture \u2013 they rise onto the tips of their [[Arthropod leg#Tarsus|tarsi]], put forward their heads, turn down their abdomens and constantly vibrate their wings in high frequencies and short beats. This behavior signals other workers to fly to the entrance of the nest and defend. However, if the nest is disturbed enough times, the workers stop defending the nest and instead grow tolerant to such attacks.<ref name=\":5\" /> However, when they detect life-threatening level of danger, the ''Vespula vulgaris'' workers will vigorously defend their nest. Unlike honey bees, which die after stinging, ''Vespula vulgaris'' can sting multiple times. This makes its sting viable for personal defense when away from the colony, and the common wasp is therefore more apt to sting. However, it will usually not sting without being provoked by sudden movement or other violent behavior.\n\nResearch indicates the wasps use odor to identify and attack rival wasps from other colonies, and nest odor frequently changes.<ref name=\":8\" /> ''Vespula vulgaris'' wasps have been observed aggressively competing with [[honey bees]] for the honeydew secreted by the scale insect ''Ultracoelostoma brittini'' in New Zealand's South Island black beech forests.<ref name=\":9\" />\n\n===Over-wintering behaviors===\nAfter mating, the queen overwinters in a hole or other sheltered location, sometimes in buildings. Wasp nests are not reused from one year to the next, but in rare instances wasps have been seen to re-nest in the footprint of a removed nest or even begin building a new nest within an old nest. In the mild climate of New Zealand and Australia, a few of the colonies may survive the winter, although this is much more common with the [[German wasp]].<ref name=\"doc\" /><ref name=\":9\" />\n\n==Factors affecting foraging==\nThe foraging activity of ''Vespula vulgaris'' is dependent on the light and temperature of the surrounding area. Generally, if the temperature of the surrounding area falls below 2\u00b0 C, the wasps will not proceed with foraging even if the temperature of the nest itself is optimal. When the temperature is above 2\u00b0 C, light intensity comes in to play a role. If the light intensity is high enough, the wasps will fly off to forage. However, there is a wide variance within the species, and even within individuals what that threshold light intensity would be \u2013 i. e. when would be the best light intensity for a wasp to go out to forage.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Blackith |first1=R. E. |title=Visual sensitivity and foraging in social wasps |journal=Insectes Sociaux |volume=5 |issue=2 |pages=159\u2013169 |doi=10.1007/bf02224066 |year=1958}}</ref>\n\nThe foraging activities of ''Vespula vulgaris'' are generally highest in early mornings. There are three known reasons for such behavior. First is to satisfy the larval requirements. The workers fly off early in the morning to forage, as soon as their optimal light intensity is reached. They want to feed the larvae which have been starving during the night as soon as possible to reduce their chance of dying. The second reason is to maximize fluid foraging. Because [[dew]]s and [[nectar]]s are most abundant early in the morning and are the best sources of fluids, the workers fly off early in the morning before the competition becomes severe. Last is the necessity to release excretory products such as trophallactic secretions from the larvae.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\nGenerally, wasps are unable to predict heavy rainfalls. They continue their foraging activities even in the rain, but cease when the rain becomes torrential. When the rainfall becomes extremely heavy near the nesting site, the workers rapidly return to their nests. Those whose foraging activities were interrupted by heavy rainfall become reluctant to forage again in the future, even when the weather is dry and calm. Those who continue to forage do so mainly for fluid.\n\nThe average life span of an adult ''Vespula vulgaris'' is known to be around two weeks (14 days). There was a negative correlation found between the age of the worker ''Vespula vulgaris'' and their respective foraging speeds, and a positive correlation between their age and the amount of time each worker spent in the nest between each foraging trip. The foraging speed decreased as the workers aged and the time a worker spent in the nest between foraging trips increased as they got older. Wasps that are over 30 days, in fact, generally cease from foraging trips and spend all of their time guarding the entrance of the nest.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\n==Diet==\nSimilarly to other ''Vespulas'', ''Vespula vulgaris'' feed on animal preys such as caterpillars to feed their developing larvae and [[carbohydrate]]s, such as nectar and sweet fruits, to satisfy their own energy requirements.<ref name=\":10\">{{cite journal |last1=Spradbery |first1=J. P. |title=Wasps: an account of the biology and natural history of solitary and social wasps |journal=London, Sidgwick & Jackson |date=1973 |page=508}}</ref> Their usual food sources are: wood pulp, freshly killed insects such as [[Hymenoptera]], [[lepidopteran]] larvae and [[Diptera]] and Spiders.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Richard |first1=Harris |title=Diet of the Wasps Vespula vulgaris and Vespula germanica in Honeydew Beech Forest of the South Island, New Zealand |journal=New Zealand Journal of Zoology |date=1991 |volume=18 |issue=2 |pages=159\u2013169 |doi=10.1080/03014223.1991.10757963}}</ref> Common wasps will also attempt to invade honey bees' nests to steal their honey.\n\nAlthough the types of prey ''Vespula vulgaris'' and ''Vespula germanica'' forage are almost the same, that of ''Vespula germanica'' are generally 2\u20133.5 times bigger and heavier than that of ''Vespula vulgaris''. This is mainly due to the size difference of the two species. Because the ''Vespula germanica'' foragers are bigger in [[Morphology (biology)|morphology]] than those of ''Vespula vulgaris'', and they both transport the prey by carrying on them, it would be advantageous for the wasp to be bigger to be able to hold larger prey.<ref name=\":10\" />\n\n==Caste system==\nIn the early stage of the colony founding, the queen ''Vespula vulgaris'' does most of the work, both building and foraging. After the nest is completely built, she expands her foraging resources from only pulps to pulps, fluids and insect flesh. The labor divides as the first batch of larvae is hatched. However, during the very beginning of the hatching, the workers do not take part of any labor. Rather, they remain motionless with their heads inside a cell. Workers actually start foraging actively after seven days. They both forage and take care of the broods by feeding the larvae, breaking down the insect flesh, dividing fluids collected by the foragers, removing trophallactic secretion from the larvae, and fixing the nests.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\n==Queen==\nOne possible factor that determines a female's social caste is known to be its nest position. The location of each cell is directly related to the amount of food a larva can receive, and the queen cell, being located at the very bottom of the nest, encounters the foragers before any other cell. Therefore, it gets most of the food and naturally, yields the biggest female \u2013 the queen.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\nAs mentioned above, the cell location can alter the size of the larva and eventually determine which female ''Vespula vulgaris'' is going to be queen. However, when several candidates of queens arise, there is competition among them. Certain variations among them rank the [[hierarchy]] of the queens and thus select the ultimate queen. Although the precise causes of the variations in the queens are still unknown, one possible factor is the amount of fat stored in the queen's body. Smaller developing queens have less fat stored, and thus have relatively higher mortality rates in winter than larger queens. The bigger the size and larger the amount of fat stored, the \"higher\" the queen is considered in quality, and she is able to out-compete other queens in finding a fit mate. She will then have an advantage in establishing a nest in the following spring.<ref name=\":11\" />\n\nIn order for the ''Vespula vulgaris'' queen to dominate all the workers \u2013 usually numbering more than 3000 in a colony  \u2013she possesses a special chemical that sends signals of dominance. The workers were discovered to regularly lick the queen while feeding her, and the air-borne [[pheromone]] from the queen's body alerts those workers of her dominance.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\n==Pest status==\nAlong with the German wasp and two species of ''[[Polistes]]'' (all [[invasive species]]), the common wasp is considered a pest species in New Zealand, as it competes with [[Endemism|endemic]] species for food, such as insects and [[Honeydew (secretion)|honeydew]].<ref name=\":0\">{{cite web |url=http://www.envbop.govt.nz/Factsheets/PestAnimal-090526-PA03.pdf |date=November 2004 |publisher=[[Environment Bay of Plenty]] |title=Wasps |work=Pest Animal Control}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book |title=The vulgar wasp: the story of a ruthless invader and ingenious predator |last=Lester, Phil, 1969-|isbn=9781776561858 |location=Wellington |oclc=1031341683|date = April 2018}}</ref><ref name=\":12\" /> In some [[South Island]] beech forests it is thought that densities of wasps are higher than anywhere else in the world.<ref name=doc>{{cite web |title=Vespula Wasp Factsheet |url=http://www.doc.govt.nz/upload/documents/conservation/threats-and-impacts/animal-pests/fact-sheet175-vespula-wasp.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120803073040/http://www.doc.govt.nz/upload/documents/conservation/threats-and-impacts/animal-pests/fact-sheet175-vespula-wasp.pdf |url-status=dead |archive-date=3 August 2012 |publisher=Department of Conservation |accessdate=19 May 2012}}</ref> It is calculated that the total weight of common wasps in these places may exceed that of all birds.<ref name=TeAra>{{cite encyclopedia |title=Story: Wasps and bees |url=http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/wasps-and-bees/3 |encyclopedia=Te Ara \u2013 the Encyclopedia of New Zealand |accessdate=19 May 2012}}</ref><ref name=\":12\" />\n\nResearch indicates the wasps use odor to identify and attack rival wasps from other colonies, and nest odor frequently changes.<ref name=\":4\">{{cite journal |pmid=16158272 |year=2005 |last1=Steinmetz |first1=I |last2=Schmolz |first2=E |title=Nest odor dynamics in the social wasp Vespula vulgaris |volume=92 |issue=9 |pages=414\u20138 |doi=10.1007/s00114-005-0006-9 |journal=Die Naturwissenschaften|bibcode=2005NW.....92..414S}}</ref> ''V. vulgaris'' wasps have been observed aggressively competing with honey bees for the honeydew secreted by the scale insect ''Ultracoelostoma brittini'' in New Zealand's South Island [[black beech]] forests.<ref name=\":9\">{{cite journal |last=Markwell |first=T.

A founding queen searches for a hollow tree, wall cavity, rock crevice, or even a mammal-made hole to build a nest. One colony cycle lasts for about 6\u201311 months and each colony cycle consists of around 3000\u20138000 larvae.\n\nThe extraordinary adaptation skills of ''V. vulgaris'' enable it to live in a wide range of habitats, from very humid areas to artificial environments such as gardens and human structures. This species, along with other wasp species such as ''V. germanica'', has impacted the ecosystem, especially those in New Zealand and Australia, where they were imported by humans, and frequently cause damage to fruit crops and endanger humans.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite journal |url= |title=Variation in Colour Marking of German Wasps Vespula germanica (F.) and Common Wasps Vespula vulgaris (L.)

Instead, each has only one black mark on its [[Clypeus (arthropod anatomy)|''clypeus'']], which is usually anchor or dagger-shaped.

Each lasts for similar periods, around 30\u201335 days. The colony starts in April as the queen begins the foundation of the nest and degenerates around October when the temperature drops and the queen dies.

Colony cohesion breaks down, cannibalism sets in, and the foraging becomes erratic.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\n==Brood production==\nThe general incubation period is five days, but it can occasionally be seven, due to [[cannibalism]], [[scavenging]] or replacement. The larval period can depend on the trophic condition inside and outside the nest. If there are abundant resources of food being brought into the nest, the larval period is short, but if the resource is short, the period can lengthen. The first adult emerges after around 23 days of hatching and the queen-pupated brood is completed in about a month (30 days).<ref name=\":5\" />\n\nThe first brood of workers are all of normal size, but the next generation of them is generally smaller, due to a decrease in the queen's foraging activity after producing the first batch of larvae. As the queen's foraging decreases, the second group of workers does not get so much food, often starves, and so spends more time in the larval stage.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\n==Nest foundation by the queen==\nAfter coming out of hibernation in the spring, the queen forages for flowers or shrubs and begins looking for nesting sites. She flies low on the ground, searching for any round, dark object or depression. If it is a hole, she flies in to inspect the details if it is suitable and if not moves on to the next hole. What constitutes a \"perfect\" nest is yet to be discovered, but it is mainly speculated that the queen's physiological state is the main deciding factor of the time and the place of nesting. When she has found a suitable site for nesting, she performs dance-like wing movements which allow her to locate the site even after she has left the area.<ref name=\":6\">{{cite journal |last1=M.

She repeats the procedure of bringing in a pulp, attaching it to the nest to form a [[wikt:spindle|spindle]] and flying back out to bring in more pulp. During this process, the queen clings to the nest with her two [[Posterior (anatomy)|posterior]] pairs of legs and attaches the pulp using her [[anterior]] legs and mouth parts.<ref name=\":5\" /> She builds 20\u201330 cells before initial egg-laying, fashioning a [[Petiole (insect)|petiole]] and producing a single cell at the end of it. Six further cells are then added around this to produce the characteristic hexagonal shape of the nest cells. One egg is laid in each cell, and as it hatches, each larva holds itself in the vertical cell by pressing its body against the sides.<ref name=\"TeAra\" />\n\nWhen the nest is completed, the queen is replaced by the workers as the foraging force and instead is now concerned only with nursing and egg producing. Her ovaries develop, her abdomen becomes distended with eggs, and she loses the ability to fly.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\nAfter the founding phase has been completed, the colony encounters a change where the workers begin to build queen cells. Once the workers start building on the queen cells, no more worker cells are built, but those that still have brood growing in them are retained. The majority of the food resource brought in by the workers is fed to the queen larvae, known as [[gynes]] and the lack of feeding for other larvae causes the prolongation of their larval periods.<ref name=\":6\" /> To ensure that only the queen's eggs are reared to adulthood, female workers remove worker-laid eggs in a process known as [[worker policing]].\n\nWhen the queen has completed her job of producing daughter queen larvae, she dies, leaving a crop of virgin queens which will leave the nest, mate, hibernate, and reproduce in the following spring. After the queen's death, the coordination of the colony breaks down and the workers begin to lay eggs. The rate and amount of foraging decrease drastically after the queen's death, so it is unable to support all the workers and their brood. This is when [[cannibalism]] occurs among the workers and furthermore, the workers tear off their cells and carry them out of the nest, dropping the temperature of the entire nest.

It has open cells and a cylindrical column known as a [[Petiole (insect)|petiole]] attaching the nest to the substrate. The wasps produce a chemical which repels ants and secrete it around the base of the petiole, to avoid ant predation.<ref name=\"doc\" />\n\nMany variations are seen in the characteristics of the nests within the species. Aerial nests and nests that are very close to the surface of the ground have much thicker envelopes than those under the ground. The wasps build thick envelopes to prevent heat from escaping. Also, smaller nests have thicker envelopes than larger nests. This is mainly due to the fact that the amount of heat produced is proportional to the volume of the nest. The larger a nest is the better it will be in conserving the nest warmth. The optimal temperature of the nest is around 32&nbsp;\u00b0C. However, when the temperature rises above the optimal temperature (during hot days), the workers use their wings as fans to cool the nest down.<ref name=\":8\">{{cite journal |last1=R. |first1=Sailer |title=Nest temperature in the common yellow-jacket |journal=Journal of the Kansas Entomological Society |date=1950 |volume=23 |pages=134\u2013137}}</ref>\n\n''V. vulgaris'' wasps recognize their nests by making [[pheromone]] trails from the entrance of their nest to the site of foraging. Those \"footprints\" are not colony specific, but species specific. Although many other insects such as ants produce such pheromone trails as well, ''Vespula vulgaris'' generate pheromone either by special abdominal glands<ref>{{cite journal |last1=E.

This difference is due mainly to the variation in prey. ''Vespula vulgaris'' food sources are greatly affected by the temperature, while those of ''Vespula germanica'' are not, providing them with a much higher chance of survival even during the winter.<ref name=\":7\" /> Because many ''Vespula germanica'' are able to overwinter and most ''Vespula vulgaris'' do not, except for the queen, this affects the nest size of the two species. ''Vespula germanica'' generally have slightly bigger nest size (3500\u20139000 larvae in one colony cycle) than ''Vespula vulgaris'' (3000\u20138000 larvae in one colony cycle).<ref>{{cite journal |last1=B.

She flies frontwards and backwards in front of the nest with a slow, hovering flight and repeats this movement until its distance is further away from the hole. When the arc of the flight increases up to about 6 ft (183 cm), the pathway makes a figure of a sideways \"8\" and when the queen is about 60 ft (18 m) away from the nest site, she then flies in a straight line. This is how the queen ''Vespula vulgaris'' marks the land, in respect to the landmarks around the nesting site.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\n===Defensive behaviors===\nOnly wasps leaving the nest notice a disturbance and defend or fight off an intruder. The ones returning to the nest do not detect any disturbance and try to enter the nest. The workers that detect danger show a certain gesture \u2013 they rise onto the tips of their [[Arthropod leg#Tarsus|tarsi]], put forward their heads, turn down their abdomens and constantly vibrate their wings in high frequencies and short beats. This behavior signals other workers to fly to the entrance of the nest and defend. However, if the nest is disturbed enough times, the workers stop defending the nest and instead grow tolerant to such attacks.<ref name=\":5\" /> However, when they detect life-threatening level of danger, the ''Vespula vulgaris'' workers will vigorously defend their nest. Unlike honey bees, which die after stinging, ''Vespula vulgaris'' can sting multiple times. This makes its sting viable for personal defense when away from the colony, and the common wasp is therefore more apt to sting. However, it will usually not sting without being provoked by sudden movement or other violent behavior.\n\nResearch indicates the wasps use odor to identify and attack rival wasps from other colonies, and nest odor frequently changes.<ref name=\":8\" /> ''Vespula vulgaris'' wasps have been observed aggressively competing with [[honey bees]] for the honeydew secreted by the scale insect ''Ultracoelostoma brittini'' in New Zealand's South Island black beech forests.<ref name=\":9\" />\n\n===Over-wintering behaviors===\nAfter mating, the queen overwinters in a hole or other sheltered location, sometimes in buildings. Wasp nests are not reused from one year to the next, but in rare instances wasps have been seen to re-nest in the footprint of a removed nest or even begin building a new nest within an old nest. In the mild climate of New Zealand and Australia, a few of the colonies may survive the winter, although this is much more common with the [[German wasp]].<ref name=\"doc\" /><ref name=\":9\" />\n\n==Factors affecting foraging==\nThe foraging activity of ''Vespula vulgaris'' is dependent on the light and temperature of the surrounding area. Generally, if the temperature of the surrounding area falls below 2\u00b0 C, the wasps will not proceed with foraging even if the temperature of the nest itself is optimal. When the temperature is above 2\u00b0 C, light intensity comes in to play a role. If the light intensity is high enough, the wasps will fly off to forage. However, there is a wide variance within the species, and even within individuals what that threshold light intensity would be \u2013 i. e. when would be the best light intensity for a wasp to go out to forage.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Blackith |first1=R. E. |title=Visual sensitivity and foraging in social wasps |journal=Insectes Sociaux |volume=5 |issue=2 |pages=159\u2013169 |doi=10.1007/bf02224066 |year=1958}}</ref>\n\nThe foraging activities of ''Vespula vulgaris'' are generally highest in early mornings. There are three known reasons for such behavior. First is to satisfy the larval requirements. The workers fly off early in the morning to forage, as soon as their optimal light intensity is reached. They want to feed the larvae which have been starving during the night as soon as possible to reduce their chance of dying. The second reason is to maximize fluid foraging. Because [[dew]]s and [[nectar]]s are most abundant early in the morning and are the best sources of fluids, the workers fly off early in the morning before the competition becomes severe. Last is the necessity to release excretory products such as trophallactic secretions from the larvae.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\nGenerally, wasps are unable to predict heavy rainfalls. They continue their foraging activities even in the rain, but cease when the rain becomes torrential. When the rainfall becomes extremely heavy near the nesting site, the workers rapidly return to their nests. Those whose foraging activities were interrupted by heavy rainfall become reluctant to forage again in the future, even when the weather is dry and calm. Those who continue to forage do so mainly for fluid.\n\nThe average life span of an adult ''Vespula vulgaris'' is known to be around two weeks (14 days). There was a negative correlation found between the age of the worker ''Vespula vulgaris'' and their respective foraging speeds, and a positive correlation between their age and the amount of time each worker spent in the nest between each foraging trip. The foraging speed decreased as the workers aged and the time a worker spent in the nest between foraging trips increased as they got older. Wasps that are over 30 days, in fact, generally cease from foraging trips and spend all of their time guarding the entrance of the nest.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\n==Diet==\nSimilarly to other ''Vespulas'', ''Vespula vulgaris'' feed on animal preys such as caterpillars to feed their developing larvae and [[carbohydrate]]s, such as nectar and sweet fruits, to satisfy their own energy requirements.<ref name=\":10\">{{cite journal |last1=Spradbery |first1=J. P. |title=Wasps: an account of the biology and natural history of solitary and social wasps |journal=London, Sidgwick & Jackson |date=1973 |page=508}}</ref> Their usual food sources are: wood pulp, freshly killed insects such as [[Hymenoptera]], [[lepidopteran]] larvae and [[Diptera]] and Spiders.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Richard |first1=Harris |title=Diet of the Wasps Vespula vulgaris and Vespula germanica in Honeydew Beech Forest of the South Island, New Zealand |journal=New Zealand Journal of Zoology |date=1991 |volume=18 |issue=2 |pages=159\u2013169 |doi=10.1080/03014223.1991.10757963}}</ref> Common wasps will also attempt to invade honey bees' nests to steal their honey.\n\nAlthough the types of prey ''Vespula vulgaris'' and ''Vespula germanica'' forage are almost the same, that of ''Vespula germanica'' are generally 2\u20133.5 times bigger and heavier than that of ''Vespula vulgaris''. This is mainly due to the size difference of the two species. Because the ''Vespula germanica'' foragers are bigger in [[Morphology (biology)|morphology]] than those of ''Vespula vulgaris'', and they both transport the prey by carrying on them, it would be advantageous for the wasp to be bigger to be able to hold larger prey.<ref name=\":10\" />\n\n==Caste system==\nIn the early stage of the colony founding, the queen ''Vespula vulgaris'' does most of the work, both building and foraging. After the nest is completely built, she expands her foraging resources from only pulps to pulps, fluids and insect flesh. The labor divides as the first batch of larvae is hatched. However, during the very beginning of the hatching, the workers do not take part of any labor. Rather, they remain motionless with their heads inside a cell. Workers actually start foraging actively after seven days. They both forage and take care of the broods by feeding the larvae, breaking down the insect flesh, dividing fluids collected by the foragers, removing trophallactic secretion from the larvae, and fixing the nests.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\n==Queen==\nOne possible factor that determines a female's social caste is known to be its nest position. The location of each cell is directly related to the amount of food a larva can receive, and the queen cell, being located at the very bottom of the nest, encounters the foragers before any other cell. Therefore, it gets most of the food and naturally, yields the biggest female \u2013 the queen.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\nAs mentioned above, the cell location can alter the size of the larva and eventually determine which female ''Vespula vulgaris'' is going to be queen. However, when several candidates of queens arise, there is competition among them. Certain variations among them rank the [[hierarchy]] of the queens and thus select the ultimate queen. Although the precise causes of the variations in the queens are still unknown, one possible factor is the amount of fat stored in the queen's body. Smaller developing queens have less fat stored, and thus have relatively higher mortality rates in winter than larger queens. The bigger the size and larger the amount of fat stored, the \"higher\" the queen is considered in quality, and she is able to out-compete other queens in finding a fit mate. She will then have an advantage in establishing a nest in the following spring.<ref name=\":11\" />\n\nIn order for the ''Vespula vulgaris'' queen to dominate all the workers \u2013 usually numbering more than 3000 in a colony  \u2013she possesses a special chemical that sends signals of dominance. The workers were discovered to regularly lick the queen while feeding her, and the air-borne [[pheromone]] from the queen's body alerts those workers of her dominance.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\n==Pest status==\nAlong with the German wasp and two species of ''[[Polistes]]'' (all [[invasive species]]), the common wasp is considered a pest species in New Zealand, as it competes with [[Endemism|endemic]] species for food, such as insects and [[Honeydew (secretion)|honeydew]].<ref name=\":0\">{{cite web |url=http://www.envbop.govt.nz/Factsheets/PestAnimal-090526-PA03.pdf |date=November 2004 |publisher=[[Environment Bay of Plenty]] |title=Wasps |work=Pest Animal Control}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book |title=The vulgar wasp: the story of a ruthless invader and ingenious predator |last=Lester, Phil, 1969-|isbn=9781776561858 |location=Wellington |oclc=1031341683|date = April 2018}}</ref><ref name=\":12\" /> In some [[South Island]] beech forests it is thought that densities of wasps are higher than anywhere else in the world.<ref name=doc>{{cite web |title=Vespula Wasp Factsheet |url=http://www.doc.govt.nz/upload/documents/conservation/threats-and-impacts/animal-pests/fact-sheet175-vespula-wasp.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120803073040/http://www.doc.govt.nz/upload/documents/conservation/threats-and-impacts/animal-pests/fact-sheet175-vespula-wasp.pdf |url-status=dead |archive-date=3 August 2012 |publisher=Department of Conservation |accessdate=19 May 2012}}</ref> It is calculated that the total weight of common wasps in these places may exceed that of all birds.<ref name=TeAra>{{cite encyclopedia |title=Story: Wasps and bees |url=http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/wasps-and-bees/3 |encyclopedia=Te Ara \u2013 the Encyclopedia of New Zealand |accessdate=19 May 2012}}</ref><ref name=\":12\" />\n\nResearch indicates the wasps use odor to identify and attack rival wasps from other colonies, and nest odor frequently changes.<ref name=\":4\">{{cite journal |pmid=16158272 |year=2005 |last1=Steinmetz |first1=I |last2=Schmolz |first2=E |title=Nest odor dynamics in the social wasp Vespula vulgaris |volume=92 |issue=9 |pages=414\u20138 |doi=10.1007/s00114-005-0006-9 |journal=Die Naturwissenschaften|bibcode=2005NW.....92..414S}}</ref> ''V. vulgaris'' wasps have been observed aggressively competing with honey bees for the honeydew secreted by the scale insect ''Ultracoelostoma brittini'' in New Zealand's South Island [[black beech]] forests.<ref name=\":9\">{{cite journal |last=Markwell |first=T.

The artwork, which deconstructed the popular song \"[[I Only Have Eyes for You]]\", created a 360 degree screen out of the circular facade of the museum.

Interviews included [[Robert Altman]], [[Claire Denis]], [[Werner Herzog]], [[Rem Koolhaas]], [[Kenneth Anger]] and others. ''The Idea of the West'' (2010) presents the collective response of 1000 people on the street who were asked \u201cWhat is your idea of the West?\u201d to create a manifesto from the quotes and comments of random individuals.  Another interview project, ''Patterns & Repetition'' (2011) is a series of filmed conversations about creativity in the 21st Century in which Aitken conducts short conversations with pioneers in different artistic disciplines, including [[Devendra Banhart]], [[Thomas Demand]], [[Jack White (musician)|Jack White]], [[James Murphy (electronic musician)|James Murphy]], [[Mike Kelley (artist)|Mike Kelley]], [[Jacques Herzog]], [[Fischli & Weiss]], [[Yayoi Kusama]], [[Stephen Shore]], and [[Dan Graham]]. Continuing his interest in the exchange of ideas, Aitken's work \"THE SOURCE\" (2012) explores the root of creativity. Six projections in a pavilion designed by [[David Adjaye]], cycle through many more interviews with artists, architects, and musicians such as Adjaye, Liz Diller, [[William Eggleston]], [[Philippe Parreno]], [[Paolo Soleri]], [[Tilda Swinton]], and [[Beck]] among others.\n\n===Happenings===\nAitken has directed many live \"happenings\" including his ''Broken Screen'' happenings from 2006 in Los Angeles and New York.<ref>http://atc.berkeley.edu/bio/Doug_Aitken/</ref> In 2009, Aitken orchestrated a real-time opera titled \"the handle comes up, the hammer comes down\" that assembled auctioneers performing against the rhythms of his ''Sonic Table'', at Il Tempo del Postino, at [[Theater Basel]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.artknowledgenews.com/art-basel-2009-worlds-premier-international-art-fair.html |title=Art Knowledge News |access-date=2010-03-26 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100211181845/http://artknowledgenews.com/art-basel-2009-worlds-premier-international-art-fair.html |archive-date=2010-02-11 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nAlso in 2009, along with his large-scale video installation, ''Frontier'', presented on the Tiber river's [[Isola Tiberina]] in the heart of Rome, Aitken staged a happening by the same title.

In 1996, for the public art organization [[Creative Time]], Aitken conceived an installation piece in the Anchorage, a cavernous space inside the base of the [[Brooklyn Bridge]], that used recordings of the traffic noises overhead. In 2004, he completed a sound sculpture for the [[Barcelona Pavilion]] composed of a central post supporting a few sweeping steel branches that rotated while highly directional speakers at the end of each branch played snippets of scripted conversation. In October 2009, Aitken's ''Sonic Pavilion'' opened to the public. The pavilion is located in the forested hills of Brazil, at [[Inhotim]]. The ''Sonic Pavilion'' provides a communal space to listen to the sounds of the earth as they are recorded through highly sensitive microphones buried close to a mile deep into the ground and carried back into the pavilion through a number of speakers. The sound heard inside the pavilion is the amplified sound of the moving interior of the earth.<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/27/t-magazine/travel/27brazilw.html?_r=1 New York Times]</ref> Aitken has collaborated on his films with a wide variety of musicians, from hip hop artist [[Andr\u00e9 3000]] of Outkast, who was in Aitken's 2002 multiscreen ''Interiors'' to indie bands like [[Lichens (musician)|Lichens]] and [[No Age]], which contributed to his score for his 2008 film ''Migration'' and 2011's ''Black Mirror'', respectively.\n\n===Books===\nAitken is also a producer of innovative books: ''I AM A BULLET: Scenes from an Accelerating Culture'' (2000) a collaboration with writer [[Dean Kuipers]]; ''Doug Aitken: A-Z Book (Fractals)'' (2003), the alphabet serves as structure to arrange Aitken's photography and video work, along with texts and interviews; ''Broken Screen'' (2005), a book of interviews with 26 artists pushing the limits of linear narrative; ''Alpha'', published in 2005 by the [[Mus\u00e9e d'Art Moderne de la Ville de Paris]]; ''Sleepwalkers'' (2007), published by the [[Museum of Modern Art]], in correspondence to the film and video installation of the same name; ''99 Cent Dreams'' (2008), a collection of photographs that captures \"moments between interaction\" to create a 21st-century nomadic travelogue;<ref>99 Cent Dreams, published by the Aspen Art Press, 2008, {{ISBN|978-0-934324-37-3}}</ref> ''Write In Jerry Brown President'' (2008), a folded artist book published by the [[Museum of Modern Art]],;<ref>[http://www.victoria-miro.com/artists/_2/ Doug Aitken] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110925104406/http://www.victoria-miro.com/artists/_2/ |date=2011-09-25 }} Victoria Miro Gallery, London.</ref> ''The Idea of the West'' (2010), which asked 1,000 people about their idea of the west, and was produced in conjunction with a happening at the [[Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles]],;<ref>[http://www.moca.org/audio/blog/?p=1076 Idea of the West] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110929074421/http://www.moca.org/audio/blog/?p=1076 |date=September 29, 2011 }}</ref> ''Black Mirror'' (2011), features a nomadic Chlo\u00eb Sevigny, produced in conjunction with a video installation and live theater performance staged on a barge;<ref>{{cite web|last=Alexander|first=Andrew|title=Book Review: Doug Aitken's \"Black Mirror\"|url=http://clatl.com/freshloaf/archives/2011/08/03/3798552-book-review-doug-aitkens-black-mirror|publisher=Creative Loafing Atlanta|accessdate=26 October 2012}}</ref> ''SONG 1'' (2012), accompanied an exhibition of the same name at the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden, the book takes the form of the Hirshhorn itself, while examining the artwork that explores the idea of pure communication through the pop song [[I Only Have Eyes for You]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=Doug Aitken: Song 1 [Hardcover]|asin=0978906322}}</ref>\n\nTwo monograph style books contain comprehensive information on the artist's career: ''Doug Aitken: 100 YRS'', published by Rizzoli <ref>http://www.rizzoliusa.com/book.php?isbn=9780847838325</ref> and ''Doug Aitken: Electric Earth'', published by Prestel.<ref>https://prestelpublishing.randomhouse.de/book/Doug-Aitken/Philippe-Vergne/Prestel-com/e508275.rhd</ref>\n\n===Station to Station===\n''Station to Station'' is a nomadic \u201c[[Happening]]\u201d that first occurred in the fall of 2013 on a transcontinental train.

The balloon sculpture was featured in a series of happenings that took place in July 2019 across the state of Massachusetts<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.cnn.com/style/article/doug-aitken-new-horizon-mirrored-air-balloon/index.html |title = Artist flies giant mirrored balloon over Massachusetts|date = 2019-07-22}}</ref>. Another project was ''Underwater Pavilions'' (2016), which consisted of three temporary sculptures that were moored to the ocean floor off Catalina Island, CA. Geometric in design, the sculptures created environments that reflected and refracted light, opening a portal that physically connected a viewer to the expanse of the ocean while simultaneously disrupting preconceived visual ideas of the aquatic world. By merging the language of contemporary architecture, land art, and ocean research and conservation, the Underwater Pavilions were a living artwork within a vibrant ecosystem.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.wallpaper.com/art/doug-aitken-and-parley-for-the-oceans-take-art-under-the-sea |title = Pacific pavilions: Doug Aitken and Parley for the Oceans take art under the waves|date = 2016-12-16}}</ref> In contrast to areas of the sculpture that have a rough and rock-like surface, mirrored sections reflected the seascape and, when approached, activated to become a kaleidoscopic observatory. The environments created by the sculptures changed and adjusted with the currents and time of day, focusing the attention of the viewer on the rhythm of the ocean and its life cycles. The artwork created a variety of converging perceptual encounters that played with the fluidity of time and space, resulting in a heightened awareness of the physical world. The sculptures were created in partnership with Parley for the Oceans and the [[Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles]].<ref>{{Cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/20/arts/design/move-over-neptune-doug-aitken-has-another-big-idea.html?_r=0 |title = Move Over, Neptune.

''diamond sea'' (1997), for example, includes three video projections, one suspended video monitor, and one full-color, illuminated transparency photograph in a dimly lit space. Multiple speakers create an immersive sound experience; the multi-screen film explores a guarded region in the Namib desert in southwestern Africa known as [[Sperrgebiet|Diamond Area 1 and 2]]. The territory, estimated at over 40,000 square miles and sealed off since 1908, contains the world\u2019s largest and richest computer-controlled diamond mine. ''Hysteria'' (1998\u20132000) uses film footage from the past four decades that shows audiences at pop and rock concerts working themselves into a frenzy on four screens in an X formation.<ref>[http://www.tate.org.uk/liverpool/exhibitions/remix/artists.htm Remix: Contemporary Art and Pop, 24 May to 26 August 2002] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051227000717/http://www.tate.org.uk/liverpool/exhibitions/remix/artists.htm |date=December 27, 2005 }} [[Tate Liverpool]].</ref> Filmed and photographed in the dusty sound stages and film sets of Bombay, ''Into the Sun'' (1999) focuses on the frenetic activity of [[Bollywood]],  recreating the sound stages of the Indian film industry with canvas projection screens, a red dirt floor, and video shown in a non-stop, twenty-four-hour loop.<ref>[http://www.victoria-miro.com/exhibitions/_280/?a=2 Doug Aitken: Into the Sun, 7 October - 12 November 1999] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110929013157/http://www.victoria-miro.com/exhibitions/_280/?a=2 |date=29 September 2011 }} Victoria Miro Gallery, London.</ref> ''diamond sea'' was presented at the 1997 [[Whitney Biennial]] and his ''electric earth'' installation, an eight projection, multi-room post cinematic experience, drew international attention and earned him the International Prize at the [[Venice Biennale]] in 1999.<ref name=autogenerated1 /> His ambitious show ''New Ocean'', which included multiple sound, photo, and video works, began with a transformation of the Serpentine Gallery in London and traveled the world to Austria, Italy and Japan, each time in a new configuration.

Concurrent with the exhibition, Aitken also presented a \"happening\" inside the museum that featured live drummers and auctioneers, and a performance by Cat Power.

The first installment in a three-part trilogy entitled ''Empire'', the work features migratory wild animals of North America as they pass through and curiously inhabit empty and desolate hotel rooms.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/05/09/arts/design/09carn.html?_r=1&scp=1&sq=roberta+smith+carnegie&st=nyt&oref=slogin | work=The New York Times | title=An Alien Sighting on Planet Pittsburgh | first=Roberta | last=Smith | date=May 9, 2008 | accessdate=May 1, 2010}}</ref>\n\nContinuing Aitken's work in large scale outdoor video installation, his artwork \"SONG 1\" (2012), created for the [[Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden]], challenged the standard of public art in Washington D.C. The artwork, which deconstructed the popular song \"[[I Only Have Eyes for You]]\", created a 360 degree screen out of the circular facade of the museum. Rather than using a more typical concave surface for such a projection, Aitken projected the film onto the convex exterior of the museum creating a cinema experience that required moving around the building and could never be fully seen from any one location.<ref>{{cite news|last=Kennicott|first=Philip|title=Hirshhorn Museum's \"Song 1\" is all about projection|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/hirshhorn-museums-song-1-is-all-about-projection/2012/03/22/gIQAZM8lUS_story.html|work=The Washington Post|accessdate=25 October 2012|date=23 March 2012}}</ref>\n\nAnother example of what the artist has called 'liquid architecture', his freestanding installation ''ALTERED EARTH'' (2012) explores the [[Camargue]] region of southern France in a maze-like flowing arrangement of twelve large projections in the hangar-like Grande Halle of the Parc des Ateliers in Arles. The work also inspired an app created by the artist and [[POSTmatter (magazine)|POST]] for the Apple iPad. <ref>{{cite web|last=Himelfarb|first=Ellen|title=Artist Doug Aitken's 'Altered Earth' exhibition in Arles, France|url=http://www.wallpaper.com/art/artist-doug-aitkens-altered-earth-exhibition-in-arles-france/6144|publisher=Wallpaper|accessdate=26 October 2012}}</ref>\n\nCommissioned by art patron [[Bagley Wright]], ''Mirror'' (2013) is a large LED screen, wrapped around the corner of the [[Seattle Art Museum]], with thin strips of vertical lights. For the project, Aitken had been filming for the project over five years, capturing images of central Seattle as well as the surrounding area. A computer program selects which parts of the footage to project in response to a live feed of information that ranges from the weather to the density of traffic in the streets of Seattle.<ref>Charlotte Burns (March 1, 2013), [http://theartnewspaper.com/articles/Seattle+to+unveil+Doug+Aitken%E2%80%99s+digital+Land+Art/28993 Seattle to unveil Doug Aitken\u2019s digital Land Art] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130308100534/http://theartnewspaper.com/articles/Seattle+to+unveil+Doug+Aitken%E2%80%99s+digital+Land+Art/28993 |date=March 8, 2013 }} ''[[The Art Newspaper]]''.</ref>\n\n===Conversations===\nIn 2006, Aitken produced ''Broken Screen: 26 Conversations with Doug Aitken'' ([[Distributed Art Publishers]], 2006), a book of interviews with twenty-six artists who aim to explore and challenge the conventions of linear narrative. Interviews included [[Robert Altman]], [[Claire Denis]], [[Werner Herzog]], [[Rem Koolhaas]], [[Kenneth Anger]] and others. ''The Idea of the West'' (2010) presents the collective response of 1000 people on the street who were asked \u201cWhat is your idea of the West?\u201d to create a manifesto from the quotes and comments of random individuals.  Another interview project, ''Patterns & Repetition'' (2011) is a series of filmed conversations about creativity in the 21st Century in which Aitken conducts short conversations with pioneers in different artistic disciplines, including [[Devendra Banhart]], [[Thomas Demand]], [[Jack White (musician)|Jack White]], [[James Murphy (electronic musician)|James Murphy]], [[Mike Kelley (artist)|Mike Kelley]], [[Jacques Herzog]], [[Fischli & Weiss]], [[Yayoi Kusama]], [[Stephen Shore]], and [[Dan Graham]]. Continuing his interest in the exchange of ideas, Aitken's work \"THE SOURCE\" (2012) explores the root of creativity. Six projections in a pavilion designed by [[David Adjaye]], cycle through many more interviews with artists, architects, and musicians such as Adjaye, Liz Diller, [[William Eggleston]], [[Philippe Parreno]], [[Paolo Soleri]], [[Tilda Swinton]], and [[Beck]] among others.\n\n===Happenings===\nAitken has directed many live \"happenings\" including his ''Broken Screen'' happenings from 2006 in Los Angeles and New York.<ref>http://atc.berkeley.edu/bio/Doug_Aitken/</ref> In 2009, Aitken orchestrated a real-time opera titled \"the handle comes up, the hammer comes down\" that assembled auctioneers performing against the rhythms of his ''Sonic Table'', at Il Tempo del Postino, at [[Theater Basel]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.artknowledgenews.com/art-basel-2009-worlds-premier-international-art-fair.html |title=Art Knowledge News |access-date=2010-03-26 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100211181845/http://artknowledgenews.com/art-basel-2009-worlds-premier-international-art-fair.html |archive-date=2010-02-11 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nAlso in 2009, along with his large-scale video installation, ''Frontier'', presented on the Tiber river\u2019s [[Isola Tiberina]] in the heart of Rome, Aitken staged a happening by the same title.

In 1996, for the public art organization [[Creative Time]], Aitken conceived an installation piece in the Anchorage, a cavernous space inside the base of the [[Brooklyn Bridge]], that used recordings of the traffic noises overhead. In 2004, he completed a sound sculpture for the [[Barcelona Pavilion]] composed of a central post supporting a few sweeping steel branches that rotated while highly directional speakers at the end of each branch played snippets of scripted conversation. In October 2009, Aitken's ''Sonic Pavilion'' opened to the public. The pavilion is located in the forested hills of Brazil, at [[Inhotim]]. The ''Sonic Pavilion'' provides a communal space to listen to the sounds of the earth as they are recorded through highly sensitive microphones buried close to a mile deep into the ground and carried back into the pavilion through a number of speakers. The sound heard inside the pavilion is the amplified sound of the moving interior of the earth.<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/27/t-magazine/travel/27brazilw.html?_r=1 New York Times]</ref> Aitken has collaborated on his films with a wide variety of musicians, from hip hop artist [[Andr\u00e9 3000]] of Outkast, who was in Aitken\u2019s 2002 multiscreen ''Interiors'' to indie bands like [[Lichens (musician)|Lichens]] and [[No Age]], which contributed to his score for his 2008 film ''Migration'' and 2011's ''Black Mirror'', respectively.\n\n===Books===\nAitken is also a producer of innovative books: ''I AM A BULLET: Scenes from an Accelerating Culture'' (2000) a collaboration with writer [[Dean Kuipers]]; ''Doug Aitken: A-Z Book (Fractals)'' (2003), the alphabet serves as structure to arrange Aitken's photography and video work, along with texts and interviews; ''Broken Screen'' (2005), a book of interviews with 26 artists pushing the limits of linear narrative; ''Alpha'', published in 2005 by the [[Mus\u00e9e d'Art Moderne de la Ville de Paris]]; ''Sleepwalkers'' (2007), published by the [[Museum of Modern Art]], in correspondence to the film and video installation of the same name; ''99 Cent Dreams'' (2008), a collection of photographs that captures \"moments between interaction\" to create a 21st-century nomadic travelogue;<ref>99 Cent Dreams, published by the Aspen Art Press, 2008, {{ISBN|978-0-934324-37-3}}</ref> ''Write In Jerry Brown President'' (2008), a folded artist book published by the [[Museum of Modern Art]],;<ref>[http://www.victoria-miro.com/artists/_2/ Doug Aitken] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110925104406/http://www.victoria-miro.com/artists/_2/ |date=2011-09-25 }} Victoria Miro Gallery, London.</ref> ''The Idea of the West'' (2010), which asked 1,000 people about their idea of the west, and was produced in conjunction with a happening at the [[Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles]],;<ref>[http://www.moca.org/audio/blog/?p=1076 Idea of the West] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110929074421/http://www.moca.org/audio/blog/?p=1076 |date=September 29, 2011 }}</ref> ''Black Mirror'' (2011), features a nomadic Chlo\u00eb Sevigny, produced in conjunction with a video installation and live theater performance staged on a barge;<ref>{{cite web|last=Alexander|first=Andrew|title=Book Review: Doug Aitken's \"Black Mirror\"|url=http://clatl.com/freshloaf/archives/2011/08/03/3798552-book-review-doug-aitkens-black-mirror|publisher=Creative Loafing Atlanta|accessdate=26 October 2012}}</ref> ''SONG 1'' (2012), accompanied an exhibition of the same name at the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden, the book takes the form of the Hirshhorn itself, while examining the artwork that explores the idea of pure communication through the pop song [[I Only Have Eyes for You]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=Doug Aitken: Song 1 [Hardcover]|asin=0978906322}}</ref>\n\nTwo monograph style books contain comprehensive information on the artist's career: ''Doug Aitken: 100 YRS'', published by Rizzoli <ref>http://www.rizzoliusa.com/book.php?isbn=9780847838325</ref> and ''Doug Aitken: Electric Earth'', published by Prestel.<ref>https://prestelpublishing.randomhouse.de/book/Doug-Aitken/Philippe-Vergne/Prestel-com/e508275.rhd</ref>\n\n===Station to Station===\n''Station to Station'' is a nomadic \u201c[[Happening]]\u201d that first occurred in the fall of 2013 on a transcontinental train.

At that time the home games were held at [[Stadion am Hutrasen|Hutrasen]] south of river [[Main (river)|Main]], which later became the venue of local competitor [[VfR 07 Schweinfurt]]. In 1919, Schweinfurt 05 had to move to a new court near Ludwigsbr\u00fccke and became member of the tier-one [[Kreisliga Bayern|Kreisliga Nordbayern]], but relegated after its first season. The team attempted a merger with Turngemeinde Schweinfurt von 1848, which lasted from 1921 to 1923, before the two groups parted ways again and the football division became ''1.

FC 05 goalkeeper [[G\u00fcnter Bernard]] made two West Germany appearances in 1962, before he joined Bundesliga founding member [[SV Werder Bremen]] one year later and was named in Germany's squad for the [[1966 FIFA World Cup]].\n\n===Second tier years: 1963\u20131976===\nAs it did not qualify for the newly established Bundesliga in 1963, Schweinfurt 05 found itself playing in the second tier [[Regionalliga S\u00fcd (1963\u20131974)|Regionalliga S\u00fcd]]. In the [[1965\u201366 Regionalliga|1965\u201366]] season, the club became Southern German champion and made it to the [[1965\u201366 Regionalliga#Bundesliga promotion round|Bundesliga advancement games]], but was unable to ascend to the top tier.\n\nWith the introduction of the [[2. Bundesliga]] in 1974, Schweinfurt was founding member of the [[2. Bundesliga S\u00fcd (1974\u201381)|southern division]] despite only finishing 15th in the last Regionalliga year. For its first 2. Bundesliga season in [[1974\u201375 2. Bundesliga|1974\u201375]], the club had signed-up former national team [[forward (association football)|striker]] and [[List of Bundesliga top scorers|Bundesliga top scorer]] [[Lothar Emmerich]]. The team earned an excellent third place and barely missed the advancement games for promotion to Bundesliga.\n\n===Yo-yo years: 1976\u20132016===\n[[File:Schweinfurt Performance Chart.png|280px|thumb|Historical chart of the 1. FC Schweinfurt 05 league performance after 1945]]\nAfter the 1974\u201375 season, FC 05 began to falter: poor results and financial problems saw the club descend first to the [[Bayernliga]] (III) and then, for the first time in 1983, to the [[Landesliga Bayern-Nord]] (IV). Schweinfurt 05 became a [[yo-yo club]] ascending and descending between tiers III and IV, with just a pair of brief 2. Bundesliga appearances in [[1990\u201391 2. Bundesliga|1990\u201391]] and in [[2001\u201302 2. Bundesliga|2001\u201302]]. In the [[1989\u201390 DFB-Pokal|1989\u201390]] season the team made it into the last sixteen of the [[DFB-Pokal]], where it lost 0\u20132 to [[Eintracht Braunschweig]].\n\nDisasters happened in 2004 when FC Schweinfurt 05 was forced to leave the Regionalliga S\u00fcd (III) because of financial reasons, and in 2005 when the club went bankrupt. The results in the Bayernliga (IV) were annulled and the team was relegated to the fifth tier Landesliga.\n\nA re-structured club successfully worked its way back into Bayernliga in 2008. After it was relegated again to the Landesliga in 2009, the team returned to the Bayerliga immediately the following year. At the end of the [[2011\u201312 Bayernliga|2011\u201312]] season the club managed to qualify for the promotion round to the new [[Regionalliga Bayern]] (IV) and advanced to the second round, where the club missed out on promotion.<ref>{{cite web|title=Das war die Relegation 2012 auf Verbandsebene |publisher=www.fupa.net|url=http://www.fupa.net/berichte/so-laeuft-die-relegation-auf-verbandsebene-21714.html |accessdate=13 June 2017|language=German}}</ref>\n\nThe club finally earned direct promotion to tier-four Regionalliga Bayern in the [[2012\u201313 Bayernliga|2012\u201313]] season by taking the championship in the Bayernliga northern division.\nSchweinfurt's first three Regionalliga years, however, were characterized by a permanent struggle against relegation.\nFC Schweinfurt 05 finished the [[2013\u201314 Regionalliga#Regionalliga Bayern|2013\u201314]] Regionalliga with a relegation play-off rank only courtesy of a controversial final game of the season. The team turned a 1\u20133 deficit into a 4\u20133 win with three goals in the last four minutes of the game,<ref>{{cite web|title='Skandal': Emp\u00f6rung nach Schweinfurts Aufholjagd |publisher=www.kicker.de|url=http://www.kicker.de/news/fussball/regionalliga/startseite/605098/artikel_skandal_empoerung-nach-schweinfurts-aufholjagd.html |accessdate=13 June 2017|language=German}}</ref> and successfully defended its league place in the following relegation round.

At that time the home games were held at [[Stadion am Hutrasen|Hutrasen]] south of river [[Main (river)|Main]], which later became the venue of local competitor [[VfR 07 Schweinfurt]]. In 1919, Schweinfurt 05 had to move to a new court near Ludwigsbr\u00fccke and became member of the tier-one [[Kreisliga Bayern|Kreisliga Nordbayern]], but relegated after its first season. The team attempted a merger with Turngemeinde Schweinfurt von 1848, which lasted from 1921 to 1923, before the two groups parted ways again and the football division became ''1.

Membership grew significantly and a number of new sports departments were formed within the organization.

The club had a couple of successful seasons in the [[Gauliga]] era, winning the top-flight [[Gauliga Bayern]] in [[1939 German football championship|1939]] and [[1942 German football championship|1942]], and qualifying for the [[List of German football champions|German football championship]] round. In the German football championship 1939 competition, Schweinfurt barely missed the semi-final qualification games after 3 wins in the group stage, where it defeated later [[1943 German football championship|1943]] and [[1944 German football championship|1944]] German champion [[Dresdner SC]] 1\u20130 in the first leg, but then lost to Dresden 0\u20131 in the deceisive away match.<ref name=\"Stumpf\">{{cite web|title=Ehemaliger 05-Torwart Hans Stumpf gestorben|trans-title=Former 05 goalkeeper Hans Stumpf passed|publisher=mainpost.de|url=https://www.mainpost.de/sport/schweinfurt/Ehemaliger-05-Torwart-Hans-Stumpf-gestorben;art795,5487291?wt_ref=https%3A%2F%2Fde.wikipedia.org%2F&wt_t=1585256396531|accessdate=26 March 2020|language=German}}</ref>\nThe club failed in the first round of the 1942 German football championship after a 1\u20132 loss to [[SG SS Stra\u00dfburg]].\n\nSchweinfurt made a semi-final appearance in the [[1936 Tschammerpokal]], when it was defeated 2\u20133 by [[FC Schalke 04]], the closest it ever came to winning a national title.

Kitzinger and Kupfer were an essential part of the famous [[Breslau Eleven|Germany national team]] who defeated [[Denmark national football team|Denmark]] 8\u20130 in [[Wroc\u0142aw|Breslau]] ([[Poland]]) on 16 May 1937.<ref name=\"Wunderteam\"/> One year later they competed at the [[1938 FIFA World Cup]], and were both called up to represent Germany within the FIFA selection [[Europe XI]] in the [[The Football Association|FA]] 75th anniversary game against [[England national football team|England]] at [[Highbury Stadium|Highbury]] in [[London]].\n\nDue to the [[Second World War]], Schweinfurt 05 merged with Luftwaffen SV Schweinfurt into KSG Schweinfurt for the [[1943\u201344 Gauliga Bayern|1943\u201344]] and [[1944\u201345 Gauliga Bayern|1944\u201345]] Gauliga seasons.<ref>{{cite web|title=Gauligisten| trans-title=Gauliga clubs|publisher=www.deutscherfussball.info | url=https://www.deutscherfussball.info/Gauligisten-S-d--Sa_Se.htm |accessdate=24 August 2017}}</ref> The club temporarily had been dissolved in May 1945 under pressure from the occupying powers.<ref name=\"Schweinfurtf\u00fchrer History\"/>\n\nAfter World War II, the re-established 1. FC Schweinfurt 05 was integrated into the first tier [[Oberliga S\u00fcd (1945\u201363)|Oberliga S\u00fcd]]. The club played in the Oberliga for the duration of the league's existence until the [[Bundesliga]], Germany's new professional league, was founded in 1963. Schweinfurt reached the round of the last sixteen of the [[DFB-Pokal 1954\u201355|1954\u201355]] DFB-Pokal, where the team lost 0\u20131 in the replay against FC Schalke 04.\n\nIn 1950, Andreas Kupfer became the first [[Captain (sports)|captain]] of the [[West Germany]] national football team on the occasion of his very final [[List of Germany international footballers|44th]] appearance. FC 05 goalkeeper [[G\u00fcnter Bernard]] made two West Germany appearances in 1962, before he joined Bundesliga founding member [[SV Werder Bremen]] one year later and was named in Germany's squad for the [[1966 FIFA World Cup]].\n\n===Second tier years: 1963\u20131976===\nAs it did not qualify for the newly established Bundesliga in 1963, Schweinfurt 05 found itself playing in the second tier [[Regionalliga S\u00fcd (1963\u20131974)|Regionalliga S\u00fcd]]. In the [[1965\u201366 Regionalliga|1965\u201366]] season, the club became Southern German champion and made it to the [[1965\u201366 Regionalliga#Bundesliga promotion round|Bundesliga advancement games]], but was unable to ascend to the top tier.\n\nWith the introduction of the [[2. Bundesliga]] in 1974, Schweinfurt was founding member of the [[2. Bundesliga S\u00fcd (1974\u201381)|southern division]] despite only finishing 15th in the last Regionalliga year. For its first 2. Bundesliga season in [[1974\u201375 2. Bundesliga|1974\u201375]], the club had signed-up former national team [[forward (association football)|striker]] and [[List of Bundesliga top scorers|Bundesliga top scorer]] [[Lothar Emmerich]]. The team earned an excellent third place and barely missed the advancement games for promotion to Bundesliga.\n\n===Yo-yo years: 1976\u20132016===\n[[File:Schweinfurt Performance Chart.png|280px|thumb|Historical chart of the 1. FC Schweinfurt 05 league performance after 1945]]\nAfter the 1974\u201375 season, FC 05 began to falter: poor results and financial problems saw the club descend first to the [[Bayernliga]] (III) and then, for the first time in 1983, to the [[Landesliga Bayern-Nord]] (IV). Schweinfurt 05 became a [[yo-yo club]] ascending and descending between tiers III and IV, with just a pair of brief 2. Bundesliga appearances in [[1990\u201391 2. Bundesliga|1990\u201391]] and in [[2001\u201302 2. Bundesliga|2001\u201302]]. In the [[1989\u201390 DFB-Pokal|1989\u201390]] season the team made it into the last sixteen of the [[DFB-Pokal]], where it lost 0\u20132 to [[Eintracht Braunschweig]].\n\nDisasters happened in 2004 when FC Schweinfurt 05 was forced to leave the Regionalliga S\u00fcd (III) because of financial reasons, and in 2005 when the club went bankrupt. The results in the Bayernliga (IV) were annulled and the team was relegated to the fifth tier Landesliga.\n\nA re-structured club successfully worked its way back into Bayernliga in 2008. After it was relegated again to the Landesliga in 2009, the team returned to the Bayerliga immediately the following year. At the end of the [[2011\u201312 Bayernliga|2011\u201312]] season the club managed to qualify for the promotion round to the new [[Regionalliga Bayern]] (IV) and advanced to the second round, where the club missed out on promotion.<ref>{{cite web|title=Das war die Relegation 2012 auf Verbandsebene |publisher=www.fupa.net|url=http://www.fupa.net/berichte/so-laeuft-die-relegation-auf-verbandsebene-21714.html |accessdate=13 June 2017|language=German}}</ref>\n\nThe club finally earned direct promotion to tier-four Regionalliga Bayern in the [[2012\u201313 Bayernliga|2012\u201313]] season by taking the championship in the Bayernliga northern division.\nSchweinfurt's first three Regionalliga years, however, were characterized by a permanent struggle against relegation.\nFC Schweinfurt 05 finished the [[2013\u201314 Regionalliga#Regionalliga Bayern|2013\u201314]] Regionalliga with a relegation play-off rank only courtesy of a controversial final game of the season.

FC Kaiserslautern]] in 1954.<ref name=\"Stadioncheck\">{{cite web|title=Willy-Sachs-Stadion, 1.

Besides the football field, the stadium offers [[track and field]] facilities, and is equipped with a classical [[Marathon]] gate. Premises at the stadium include changing rooms for players, coaches, and referees. Speaker cabins and a press area are available in the grandstand.\n\nThe stadium has been renovated and equipped with [[floodlights]] in 2001 in order to meet the requirements for [[2001\u201302 2. Bundesliga|2. Bundesliga]]. In addition, an electronic [[scoreboard]] was contributed by Schweinfurt's [[Ball bearing|large]] industry. Wavebreakers have been installed on the standing rooms in 2014 to safeguard the stadium's full capacity.<ref name=\"In und um SW\">{{cite web|title=Im Schweinfurter Willy-Sachs-Stadion werden gerade die Wellenbrecher errichtet|trans-title=Wavebreakers for the Willy-Sachs-Stadion|periodical=|publisher=in-und-um-schweinfurt.de|url=https://in-und-um-schweinfurt.de/lokales/2014/09/25/im-schweinfurter-willy-sachs-stadion-werden-gerade-die-wellenbrecher-errichtet/|work=|language=German|accessdate=20 July 2017|date=25 September 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Players==\n===Current squad===\n{{updated|29 January 2020}}|<ref name=\"Staff\">{{cite web|title=Mannschaftskader 1.

In 2010, Amazon was reported as being the largest single source of Internet consumer reviews.<ref>{{cite press release |url=http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20100503005110/en/2010-Social-Shopping-Study-Reveals-Consumers%E2%80%99-Online |title=2010 Social Shopping Study Reveals Changes in Consumers' Online Shopping Habits and Usage of Customer Reviews |work=the e-tailing group, PowerReviews |publisher=[[Business Wire]] |date=May 3, 2010 |accessdate=January 31, 2013}}</ref>\n\nWhen publishers asked Bezos why Amazon would publish negative reviews, he defended the practice by claiming that Amazon.com was \"taking a different approach ... we want to make every book available\u2014the good, the bad and the ugly ... to let truth loose\".<ref>{{cite book |title=Amazon.com |author=Spector, Robert |year=2002 |page=132}}</ref>\n\nThere have been cases of positive reviews being written and posted by [[public relations]] companies on behalf of their clients<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cincinnatibeacon.com/index.php?/contents/comments/amazon.com_rave_book_reviews_too_good_to_be_true |title=BEACON SPOTLIGHT: Amazon.com rave book reviews \u2013 too good to be true? |work=The Cincinnati Beacon |date=May 25, 2010 |accessdate=January 31, 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140502004404/http://www.cincinnatibeacon.com/index.php?%2Fcontents%2Fcomments%2Famazon.com_rave_book_reviews_too_good_to_be_true |archivedate=May 2, 2014 }}</ref> and instances of writers using pseudonyms to leave negative reviews of their rivals' works.\n\n=== Content search ===\n\"Search Inside the Book\" is a feature which allows customers to search for keywords in the full text of many books in the catalog.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.amazon.com |title=Amazon's online reader ''Search Inside'' reference |date=September 9, 2009 |accessdate=August 29, 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100828044958/http://www.amazon.com/ |archivedate=August 28, 2010 |url-status=live |df=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.amazon.com |title=''Search Inside'' reference |date=September 9, 2009 |accessdate=August 29, 2010}}</ref> The feature started with 120,000 titles (or 33 million pages of text) on October 23, 2003.<ref>{{cite web |first=Eric |last=Ward |url=http://www.urlwire.com/news/102203.html |title=Amazon.com Launches \"Search Inside the Book\" Feature |publisher=Urlwire.com |date=October 23, 2003 |accessdate=August 29, 2010}}</ref> There are about 300,000 books in the program.

It is a relative indicator of popularity that is updated hourly. Effectively, it is a \"best sellers list\" for the millions of products stocked by Amazon.<ref name=\"amazon\">{{cite web |url=https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=14101911 |title=Amazon FAQ |accessdate=September 5, 2011}}</ref> While the ASR has no direct effect on the sales of a product, it is used by Amazon to determine which products to include in its bestsellers lists.<ref name=\"amazon\" /> Products that appear in these lists enjoy additional exposure on the Amazon website and this may lead to an increase in sales. In particular, products that experience large jumps (up or down) in their sales ranks may be included within Amazon's lists of \"movers and shakers\"; such a listing provides additional exposure that might lead to an increase in sales.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.amazon.com/gp/movers-and-shakers |title=Amazon.com Movers and shakers |accessdate=September 5, 2011}}</ref> For competitive reasons, Amazon does not release actual sales figures to the public.

Amazon started by focusing on business-to-consumer relationships between itself and its customers and business-to-business relationships between itself and its suppliers and then moved to facilitate customer-to-customer with the Amazon marketplace which acts as an intermediary to facilitate transactions. The company lets anyone sell nearly anything using its platform. In addition to an affiliate program that lets anyone post Amazon links and earn a commission on click-through sales, there is now a program which lets those affiliates build entire websites based on Amazon's platform.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://money.howstuffworks.com/amazon2.htm |title=How Amazon Works |accessdate=December 15, 2011|date=January 25, 2006 }}</ref>\n\nSome other large e-commerce sellers use Amazon to sell their products in addition to selling them through their own websites. The sales are processed through Amazon.com and end up at individual sellers for processing and order fulfillment and Amazon leases space for these retailers. Small sellers of used and new goods go to Amazon Marketplace to offer goods at a fixed price.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=743056 |title=Help |accessdate=December 16, 2011}}</ref>\n\nAmazon also employs the use of [[drop shipping|drop shippers]] or meta sellers. These are members or entities that advertise goods on Amazon who order these goods direct from other competing websites but usually from other Amazon members. These meta sellers may have millions of products listed, have large transaction numbers and are grouped alongside other less prolific members giving them credibility as just someone who has been in business for a long time. Markup is anywhere from 50% to 100% and sometimes more, these sellers maintain that items are in stock when the opposite is true. As Amazon increases their dominance in the marketplace these drop shippers have become more and more commonplace in recent years.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}\n\nIn November 2015, Amazon opened a physical Amazon Books store in [[University Village, Seattle|University Village]] in Seattle.

It is a relative indicator of popularity that is updated hourly. Effectively, it is a \"best sellers list\" for the millions of products stocked by Amazon.<ref name=\"amazon\">{{cite web |url=https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=14101911 |title=Amazon FAQ |accessdate=September 5, 2011}}</ref> While the ASR has no direct effect on the sales of a product, it is used by Amazon to determine which products to include in its bestsellers lists.<ref name=\"amazon\" /> Products that appear in these lists enjoy additional exposure on the Amazon website and this may lead to an increase in sales. In particular, products that experience large jumps (up or down) in their sales ranks may be included within Amazon's lists of \"movers and shakers\"; such a listing provides additional exposure that might lead to an increase in sales.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.amazon.com/gp/movers-and-shakers |title=Amazon.com Movers and shakers |accessdate=September 5, 2011}}</ref> For competitive reasons, Amazon does not release actual sales figures to the public.

Amazon started by focusing on business-to-consumer relationships between itself and its customers and business-to-business relationships between itself and its suppliers and then moved to facilitate customer-to-customer with the Amazon marketplace which acts as an intermediary to facilitate transactions. The company lets anyone sell nearly anything using its platform. In addition to an affiliate program that lets anyone post Amazon links and earn a commission on click-through sales, there is now a program which lets those affiliates build entire websites based on Amazon's platform.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://money.howstuffworks.com/amazon2.htm |title=How Amazon Works |accessdate=December 15, 2011|date=January 25, 2006 }}</ref>\n\nSome other large e-commerce sellers use Amazon to sell their products in addition to selling them through their own websites. The sales are processed through Amazon.com and end up at individual sellers for processing and order fulfillment and Amazon leases space for these retailers. Small sellers of used and new goods go to Amazon Marketplace to offer goods at a fixed price.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=743056 |title=Help |accessdate=December 16, 2011}}</ref>\n\nAmazon also employs the use of [[drop shipping|drop shippers]] or meta sellers. These are members or entities that advertise goods on Amazon who order these goods direct from other competing websites but usually from other Amazon members. These meta sellers may have millions of products listed, have large transaction numbers and are grouped alongside other less prolific members giving them credibility as just someone who has been in business for a long time.
