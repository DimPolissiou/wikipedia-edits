On May 25, 2012, Google unveiled another Penguin update, called Penguin 1.1. This update, according to [[Matt Cutts]], former head of webspam at Google, was supposed to affect less than one-tenth of a percent of English searches. The guiding principle for the update was to penalize websites that were using manipulative techniques to achieve high rankings. Pre-Penguin sites commonly used negative link building techniques to rank highly and get traffic, once Penguin was rolled out it meant that content was key and those with great content would be recognised and those with little or spammy content would be penalised and receive no ranking benefits.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.weareinfront.com/google-penguin-update-guide/|title=A Guide To The Penguin Update - In Front Digital|date=2015-03-12|website=In Front Digital|language=en-GB|access-date=2016-06-13}}</ref> The purpose per Google was to catch excessive spammers.

During the last years webmasters instead always had to wait for the roll-out of the next update to get out of a Penguin penalty. Also, Google Penguin 4.0 is more granular as opposed to previous updates, since it may affect a website on a URL-basis as opposed to always affecting a whole website.

Google also has a reconsideration form through Google Webmaster Tools.\n\nIn January 2015, Google's John Mueller said that a Penguin penalty can be removed by simply building good links. The usual process is to remove bad links manually or by using Google's Disavow tool and then filing a reconsideration request. Mueller elaborated on this by saying the algorithm looks at the percentage of good links versus bad links, so by building more good links it may tip the algorithm in your favor which would lead to recovery.<ref>{{cite web|title = Google: Even Without Disavowing, Getting Good Links Can Remove Your Penguin Problems|url = https://www.seroundtable.com/google-disavow-good-links-penguin-19696.html|accessdate = 2015-06-25}}</ref>\n\n==Confirmed Penguin updates==\n\n* '''Penguin 1''' on April 24, 2012 (impacting around 3.1% of queries)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://googlewebmastercentral.blogspot.fr/2012/04/another-step-to-reward-high-quality.html |title=Another step to reward high-quality sites |publisher=Official Google Blog |date=April 24, 2012 |accessdate=May 27, 2014}}</ref>\n* '''Penguin 2''' on May 26, 2012 (impacting less than 0.1%)<ref>{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/mattcutts/status/206232437427154944 |title=Google Releases Penguin Update 2 |publisher=Matt Cutts |date=May 26, 2012 |accessdate=May 27, 2014}}</ref>\n* '''Penguin 3''' on October 5, 2012 (impacting around 0.3% of queries)<ref>{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/mattcutts/status/254335294063656960 |title=Google Penguin Update 3 Released |publisher=Matt Cutts |date=October 5, 2012 |accessdate=May 27, 2014}}</ref>\n* '''Penguin 4''' (also known as Penguin 2.0) on May 22, 2013 (impacting 2.3% of queries)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mattcutts.com/blog/penguin-2-0-rolled-out-today/ |title=Penguin 4, With Penguin 2.0 Generation Spam-Fighting |publisher=Matt Cutts |date=May 22, 2013 |accessdate=May 27, 2014}}</ref>\n* '''Penguin 5''' (also known as Penguin 2.1) on October 4, 2013 (impacting around 1% of queries)<ref>{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/mattcutts/status/386231794883780609 |title=Penguin 5, With The Penguin 2.1 Spam-Filtering Algorithm |publisher=Matt Cutts |date=October 4, 2013 |accessdate=May 27, 2014}}</ref>\n* '''Penguin 6''' (also known as Penguin 3.0) on October 17, 2014 (impacting less than 1% English queries).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.seroundtable.com/google-penguin-3-impact-roll-19321.html |title=Google AutoCorrects: Penguin 3.0 Still Rolling Out & 1% Impact |publisher=Barry Schwartz|date=October 21, 2014 |accessdate=October 21, 2014}}</ref>  On December 1, 2014 Google confirmed that the update was still rolling out with webmasters continuing to report significant fluctuations.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Schwartz|first1=Barry|title=Google Penguin Reversals & Fluctuations This Morning|url=https://www.seroundtable.com/google-penguin-changes-19517.html|website=Search Engine Roundtable|publisher=SE  Roundtable|accessdate=2 December 2014}}</ref>\n* '''Penguin 7''' (also known as Penguin 4.0) on September 23, 2016<ref>{{cite web|last1=Illyes|first1=Gary|title=Penguin is now part of our core algorithm|url=https://webmasters.googleblog.com/2016/09/penguin-is-now-part-of-our-core.html|website=Google Webmaster Central Blog|publisher=Google|accessdate=23 September 2016}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Google Panda]]\n* [[Google penalty]]\n* [[Google Hummingbird]]\n* [[RankBrain]]\n* [[Author Rank]]\n* [[Mobilegeddon]]\n* [[PageRank]]\n* [[Google Pigeon]]\n* [[Knowledge Graph]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n* [https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702303505504577406751747002494 Wall Street Journal - As Google Tweaks Searches, Some Get Lost in the Web]\n* [http://www.weareinfront.com/google-penguin-update-guide/ In Front Digital - A Guide To The Penguin Update]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20171005114749/https://www.webpronews.com/google-will-announce-long-anticipated-penguin-update-2016-04/ WebProNews - Google To Announce The Latest Penguin Update]\n* [http://www.abac-bd.com/google-penguin-3-0-update-rolling-out-effects-and-cure/ Google Penguin 3.0 Update Rolling Out, Effects and Cure]\n* [https://digitrio.com.sg/the-return-of-the-penguin/ Google Penguin 4.0 Star Wars Infographics]\n* [https://makeyourrank.in/news/google-seo-updates-privacy-policy/ Google privacy policy updates]\n{{Google LLC}}\n\n<!--- Categories --->\n[[Category:Search engine optimization]]\n[[Category:Link analysis]]\n[[Category:Google Search|Penguin]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Google search engine algorithm update}}\n{{Use mdy dates|date=November 2014}}\n'''Google Penguin''' is a [[codename]]<ref name=SEL>{{cite web|author=Matt Cutts |url=https://twitter.com/mattcutts/status/206232437427154944 |title=Penguin Gets Official Name |publisher=Twitter.com |date= |accessdate=2018-06-05}}</ref> for a Google algorithm update that was first announced on April 24, 2012.

As a result of this, there is less need to use the disavow file.<ref name=\"searchengineland1\"/> Google uses both algorithm and human reviewers to identify links that are unnatural (artificial), manipulative or deceptive and includes these in its Manual Actions report for websites.<ref>{{cite web|title=Manual Actions report|url=https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/2604824|accessdate=5 September 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Google's Penguin feedback form==\nTwo days after the Penguin update was released Google prepared a feedback form,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/viewform?formkey=dEVxdmdRWFJRTjRoLWZVTHZkaTBQbkE6MQ |title=Feedback on our recent algorithm update (\"Penguin\") |publisher=Docs.google.com |date=April 24, 2012 |accessdate=June 16, 2013}}</ref> designed for two categories of users: those who want to report [[web spam]] that still ranks highly after the [[search algorithm]] change, and those who think that their site got unfairly hit by the update. Google also has a reconsideration form through Google Webmaster Tools.\n\nIn January 2015, Google's John Mueller said that a Penguin penalty can be removed by simply building good links. The usual process is to remove bad links manually or by using Google's Disavow tool and then filing a reconsideration request. Mueller elaborated on this by saying the algorithm looks at the percentage of good links versus bad links, so by building more good links it may tip the algorithm in your favor which would lead to recovery.<ref>{{cite web|title = Google: Even Without Disavowing, Getting Good Links Can Remove Your Penguin Problems|url = https://www.seroundtable.com/google-disavow-good-links-penguin-19696.html|accessdate = 2015-06-25}}</ref>\n\n==Confirmed Penguin updates==\n\n* '''Penguin 1''' on April 24, 2012 (impacting around 3.1% of queries)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://googlewebmastercentral.blogspot.fr/2012/04/another-step-to-reward-high-quality.html |title=Another step to reward high-quality sites |publisher=Official Google Blog |date=April 24, 2012 |accessdate=May 27, 2014}}</ref>\n* '''Penguin 2''' on May 26, 2012 (impacting less than 0.1%)<ref>{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/mattcutts/status/206232437427154944 |title=Google Releases Penguin Update 2 |publisher=Matt Cutts |date=May 26, 2012 |accessdate=May 27, 2014}}</ref>\n* '''Penguin 3''' on October 5, 2012 (impacting around 0.3% of queries)<ref>{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/mattcutts/status/254335294063656960 |title=Google Penguin Update 3 Released |publisher=Matt Cutts |date=October 5, 2012 |accessdate=May 27, 2014}}</ref>\n* '''Penguin 4''' (also known as Penguin 2.0) on May 22, 2013 (impacting 2.3% of queries)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mattcutts.com/blog/penguin-2-0-rolled-out-today/ |title=Penguin 4, With Penguin 2.0 Generation Spam-Fighting |publisher=Matt Cutts |date=May 22, 2013 |accessdate=May 27, 2014}}</ref>\n* '''Penguin 5''' (also known as Penguin 2.1) on October 4, 2013 (impacting around 1% of queries)<ref>{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/mattcutts/status/386231794883780609 |title=Penguin 5, With The Penguin 2.1 Spam-Filtering Algorithm |publisher=Matt Cutts |date=October 4, 2013 |accessdate=May 27, 2014}}</ref>\n* '''Penguin 6''' (also known as Penguin 3.0) on October 17, 2014 (impacting less than 1% English queries).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.seroundtable.com/google-penguin-3-impact-roll-19321.html |title=Google AutoCorrects: Penguin 3.0 Still Rolling Out & 1% Impact |publisher=Barry Schwartz|date=October 21, 2014 |accessdate=October 21, 2014}}</ref>  On December 1, 2014 Google confirmed that the update was still rolling out with webmasters continuing to report significant fluctuations.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Schwartz|first1=Barry|title=Google Penguin Reversals & Fluctuations This Morning|url=https://www.seroundtable.com/google-penguin-changes-19517.html|website=Search Engine Roundtable|publisher=SE  Roundtable|accessdate=2 December 2014}}</ref>\n* '''Penguin 7''' (also known as Penguin 4.0) on September 23, 2016<ref>{{cite web|last1=Illyes|first1=Gary|title=Penguin is now part of our core algorithm|url=https://webmasters.googleblog.com/2016/09/penguin-is-now-part-of-our-core.html|website=Google Webmaster Central Blog|publisher=Google|accessdate=23 September 2016}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Google Panda]]\n* [[Google penalty]]\n* [[Google Hummingbird]]\n* [[RankBrain]]\n* [[Author Rank]]\n* [[Mobilegeddon]]\n* [[PageRank]]\n* [[Google Pigeon]]\n* [[Knowledge Graph]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n* [https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702303505504577406751747002494 Wall Street Journal - As Google Tweaks Searches, Some Get Lost in the Web]\n* [http://www.weareinfront.com/google-penguin-update-guide/ In Front Digital - A Guide To The Penguin Update]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20171005114749/https://www.webpronews.com/google-will-announce-long-anticipated-penguin-update-2016-04/ WebProNews - Google To Announce The Latest Penguin Update]\n* [http://www.abac-bd.com/google-penguin-3-0-update-rolling-out-effects-and-cure/ Google Penguin 3.0 Update Rolling Out, Effects and Cure]\n* [https://digitrio.com.sg/the-return-of-the-penguin/ Google Penguin 4.0 Star Wars Infographics]\n\n{{Google LLC}}\n\n<!--- Categories --->\n[[Category:Search engine optimization]]\n[[Category:Link analysis]]\n[[Category:Google Search|Penguin]]\n", "name_user": "Makeyourrank", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eExternal links", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Penguin"}

The script, written by [[Anubhav Sinha]] and [[Kanika Dhillon]], originated as an idea that [[Anubhav Sinha]] got when he saw a television commercial and which he subsequently expanded. The film follows Shekhar Subramanium (Shah Rukh Khan), a game designer who creates a [[Motion controller|motion sensor]]-based game in which the antagonist (Ra.One) is more powerful than the protagonist (G.One). The former escapes from the game's virtual world and enters the real world; his aim is to kill Lucifer, the game ID of Shekhar's son and the only player to have challenged Ra.One's power. Relentlessly pursued, the family is forced to bring out G.One from the virtual world to defeat Ra.One and protect them.\n\n[[Principal photography]] began in March 2010 and took place in [[India]] and the [[United Kingdom]] and was overseen by an international crew. The [[post-production]] involved [[stereoscopy|3-D conversion]] and the application of [[visual effects]], the latter being recognised as a technological breakthrough among [[Cinema of India|Indian films]]. With a budget of {{INRConvert|150|c|year=2011}},<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/bollywood/despite-rs-170cr-income-ra-one-not-a-hit/story-yw7lvEwuItuSwHIIBGpFyI.html | title=Despite Rs 170cr income, RA.One not a hit?| date=2011-11-02}}</ref> inclusive of publicity costs, ''Ra.One'' was the [[List of most expensive Indian films|most expensive Indian film]] at the time of release surpassing the {{INRConvert|132|c|year=2010}} budget of ''[[Enthiran]]''. The producers spent {{INRConvert|130|c|year=2011}} out of a {{INRConvert|52|c|year=2011}} marketing budget, which involved a nine-month publicity campaign, brand tie-ups, merchandise, video games and [[viral marketing]].\n\nThe film faced controversies involving plagiarism, content leaks and copyright challenges. Consequently, ''Ra.One'' was theatrically released on 26 October 2011, the beginning of the five-day [[Diwali]] weekend, in 2D, 3D and dubbed versions in Tamil and Telugu languages, with three international premieres being held between 24 & 26 October 2011. The film witnessed the largest international theatrical release for an Indian film as of 2011, and was preceded by high audience and commercial expectations.\n\nUpon release, ''Ra.One'' received mixed to positive reviews, with critics praising the visual effects, action sequences, music, and the performances of Khan and Rampal, but criticising the script, direction, and screenplay. Commercially, the film became [[List of Bollywood films of 2011|the third highest-grossing Bollywood film of 2011]] domestically, the second highest-grossing Bollywood film of 2011 worldwide, and broke a number of opening box office records.

To impress his sceptical son Prateek, and upon the request of his wife Sonia, Shekhar uses his son's idea that the [[antagonist]] should be more powerful than the [[protagonist]]. Jenny, his colleague, uses Shekhar's face as a model for that of the game's protagonist G.One (Technically ''Good One'' and in Hindi ''Jeevan'', which means life), while the shape-shifting antagonist Ra.One (Technically ''Random Access Version One'' and in Hindi ''[[Ravana|Ravan]]'', an ancient demon king)<ref name=sss>{{cite news|url=http://www.mid-day.com/entertainment/2011/oct/261011-ra-one-shah-rukh-khan-film-review-superhero-film-two-half-stars.htm |title=''Ra.One'' fails to impress |newspaper=Mid-Day |date=26 October 2011 |accessdate=6 June 2012 |author=Shetty-Shah, Shubha |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/68DcAXtGs?url=http://www.mid-day.com/entertainment/2011/oct/261011-ra-one-shah-rukh-khan-film-review-superhero-film-two-half-stars.htm |archivedate= 6 June 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref> is made faceless. Another colleague, Aakaashi, implements the characters' movements. The game, named ''Ra.One'', contains three levels, the final level being the only one in which either character can be killed. Each character possesses a special device \u2013 the ''H.A.R.T'' (Hertz Amplifying Resonance Transmitter) which gives them their powers. Upon reaching the last level, the characters gain a gun with one bullet; the other character can be killed by this bullet but only if his H.A.R.T is attached.\n\nWhen ''Ra.One'' undergoes final tests, Aakaashi notices unusual glitches but chooses to ignore them. When the game is officially launched, it receives a standing ovation from the audience; an enamored Prateek insists on playing it immediately. He logs in under the ID ''Lucifer'' and proceeds to the second level, but is interrupted by Aakaashi. Ra.One, unable to end his turn with Lucifer and angry that a player has proceeded so far, becomes determined that Lucifer must die. He uses the wireless technology to enter the real world, a process which causes the [[mainframe computer|mainframe]] to malfunction. Aakaashi informs Shekhar, who understands the situation and rushes home, fearing for his son's life. Aakaashi is murdered by Ra.One taking his appearance. He goes to find Lucifer, and meets Shekhar in the process. In an attempt to save his son, Shekhar claims that he is Lucifer, but his lie is exposed when Ra.One scans his identity card. Consequently, Ra.One kills Shekhar and makes it look like a car accident.\n\nSonia, devastated after Shekhar's death, tells Prateek that the family will return to India after Shekhar's funeral. A suspicious Prateek notices digital patterns on the fateful road and realises that Ra.One has come to life. He convinces Jenny of the same when they see the destroyed game laboratory, and the latter tries to bring G.One into the real world. Having killed Aakaashi's mother viciously at her house, Ra.One chases Prateek and Sonia  on their way to the airport, but G.One enters the real world and causes a gas explosion which temporarily disables Ra.One. G.One takes Ra.One's H.A.R.T. and accompanies the family to Mumbai after Sonia realises that he can protect her son.\n\nRa.One returns to life, takes the form of a billboard model ([[Arjun Rampal]]), and tracks down G.One to Prateek's birthday party. Hypnotising Sonia, he assumes her form to kidnap Prateek. Ra.One then instructs G.One to give him his H.A.R.T. back, and sends the real Sonia in a malfunctioning [[Mumbai Suburban Railway|local train]]. The train crashes, but G.One saves Sonia and others in time. To save Prateek, he arrives at the game launch venue and fights Ra.One; both reach the third level, with the former left with little power. G.One tricks Ra.One into shooting him without his H.A.R.T. attached. Furious, Ra. One creates ten copies of himself. Prateek, unable to identify the real Ra.One, asks G.One to quote Shekhar: \"If you join the forces of evil, its shadows shall always follow you\". The duo realise that only one of the ten Ra.Ones has a shadow: the original one. G.One shoots and destroys him with the sole bullet, absorbs Ra.One's remains and returns to the virtual world.\n\nSix months later, Prateek and Sonia return to London, where Prateek manages to restore G.One to the real world in remembrance of his late father.\n\n==Cast==\n[[File:Armaan Verma.jpg|160px|thumbnail|right|Armaan Verma plays Prateek, the film's major protagonist]]\n\nThe major characters of ''Ra.One'' were played by [[protagonist]]s [[Shah Rukh Khan]] and [[Kareena Kapoor]] and primary [[antagonist]] [[Arjun Rampal]].

The script, written by [[Anubhav Sinha]] and [[Kanika Dhillon]], originated as an idea that [[Anubhav Sinha]] got when he saw a television commercial and which he subsequently expanded. The film follows Shekhar Subramanium (Shah Rukh Khan), a game designer who creates a [[Motion controller|motion sensor]]-based game in which the antagonist (Ra.One) is more powerful than the protagonist (G.One). The former escapes from the game's virtual world and enters the real world; his aim is to kill Lucifer, the game ID of Shekhar's son and the only player to have challenged Ra.One's power. Relentlessly pursued, the family is forced to bring out G.One from the virtual world to defeat Ra.One and protect them.\n\n[[Principal photography]] began in March 2010 and took place in [[India]] and the [[United Kingdom]] and was overseen by an international crew. The [[post-production]] involved [[stereoscopy|3-D conversion]] and the application of [[visual effects]], the latter being recognised as a technological breakthrough among [[Cinema of India|Indian films]]. With a budget of {{INRConvert|150|c|year=2011}},<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/bollywood/despite-rs-170cr-income-ra-one-not-a-hit/story-yw7lvEwuItuSwHIIBGpFyI.html | title=Despite Rs 170cr income, RA.One not a hit?| date=2011-11-02}}</ref> inclusive of publicity costs, ''Ra.One'' was the [[List of most expensive Indian films|most expensive Indian film]] at the time of release surpassing the {{INRConvert|132|c|year=2010}} budget of ''[[Enthiran]]''. The producers spent {{INRConvert|130|c|year=2011}} out of a {{INRConvert|52|c|year=2011}} marketing budget, which involved a nine-month publicity campaign, brand tie-ups, merchandise, video games and [[viral marketing]].\n\nThe film faced controversies involving plagiarism, content leaks and copyright challenges. Consequently, ''Ra.One'' was theatrically released on 26 October 2011, the beginning of the five-day [[Diwali]] weekend, in 2D, 3D and dubbed versions in Tamil and Telugu languages, with three international premieres being held between 24 & 26 October 2011. The film witnessed the largest international theatrical release for an Indian film as of 2011, and was preceded by high audience and commercial expectations.\n\nUpon release, ''Ra.One'' received mixed to positive reviews, with critics praising the visual effects, action sequences, music, and the performances of Khan and Rampal, but criticising the script, direction, and screenplay. Commercially, the film became [[List of Bollywood films of 2011|the third highest-grossing Bollywood film of 2011]] domestically, the second highest-grossing Bollywood film of 2011 worldwide, and broke a number of opening box office records. As the film earned more than \u20b9207 crores, it was considered a \"Hit\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.boxofficeindia.com/movie.php?movieid=28|title=Ra.One - Movie|website=[[Box Office India]]}}</ref> The film subsequently won a number of awards for its technical aspects, notably one [[59th National Film Awards|National Film Award]], one [[57th Filmfare Awards|Filmfare Award]] and four [[International Indian Film Academy Awards]].\n\n==Plot==\n{{Long plot|date=December 2019}}\nShekhar Subramanium, a game designer who works at Barron Industries, has delivered a number of commercial failures; an irate Barron gives him his last chance to develop a successful game. To impress his sceptical son Prateek, and upon the request of his wife Sonia, Shekhar uses his son's idea that the [[antagonist]] should be more powerful than the [[protagonist]]. Jenny, his colleague, uses Shekhar's face as a model for that of the game's protagonist G.One (Technically ''Good One'' and in Hindi ''Jeevan'', which means life), while the shape-shifting antagonist Ra.One (Technically ''Random Access Version One'' and in Hindi ''[[Ravana|Ravan]]'', an ancient demon king)<ref name=sss>{{cite news|url=http://www.mid-day.com/entertainment/2011/oct/261011-ra-one-shah-rukh-khan-film-review-superhero-film-two-half-stars.htm |title=''Ra.One'' fails to impress |newspaper=Mid-Day |date=26 October 2011 |accessdate=6 June 2012 |author=Shetty-Shah, Shubha |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/68DcAXtGs?url=http://www.mid-day.com/entertainment/2011/oct/261011-ra-one-shah-rukh-khan-film-review-superhero-film-two-half-stars.htm |archivedate= 6 June 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref> is made faceless. Another colleague, Aakaashi, implements the characters' movements. The game, named ''Ra.One'', contains three levels, the final level being the only one in which either character can be killed. Each character possesses a special device \u2013 the ''H.A.R.T'' (Hertz Amplifying Resonance Transmitter) which gives them their powers. Upon reaching the last level, the characters gain a gun with one bullet; the other character can be killed by this bullet but only if his H.A.R.T is attached.\n\nWhen ''Ra.One'' undergoes final tests, Aakaashi notices unusual glitches but chooses to ignore them. When the game is officially launched, it receives a standing ovation from the audience; an enamored Prateek insists on playing it immediately. He logs in under the ID ''Lucifer'' and proceeds to the second level, but is interrupted by Aakaashi. Ra.One, unable to end his turn with Lucifer and angry that a player has proceeded so far, becomes determined that Lucifer must die. He uses the wireless technology to enter the real world, a process which causes the [[mainframe computer|mainframe]] to malfunction. Aakaashi informs Shekhar, who understands the situation and rushes home, fearing for his son's life. Aakaashi is murdered by Ra.One taking his appearance. He goes to find Lucifer, and meets Shekhar in the process. In an attempt to save his son, Shekhar claims that he is Lucifer, but his lie is exposed when Ra.One scans his identity card. Consequently, Ra.One kills Shekhar and makes it look like a car accident.\n\nSonia, devastated after Shekhar's death, tells Prateek that the family will return to India after Shekhar's funeral. A suspicious Prateek notices digital patterns on the fateful road and realises that Ra.One has come to life. He convinces Jenny of the same when they see the destroyed game laboratory, and the latter tries to bring G.One into the real world. Having killed Aakaashi's mother viciously at her house, Ra.One chases Prateek and Sonia  on their way to the airport, but G.One enters the real world and causes a gas explosion which temporarily disables Ra.One. G.One takes Ra.One's H.A.R.T. and accompanies the family to Mumbai after Sonia realises that he can protect her son.\n\nRa.One returns to life, takes the form of a billboard model ([[Arjun Rampal]]), and tracks down G.One to Prateek's birthday party. Hypnotising Sonia, he assumes her form to kidnap Prateek. Ra.One then instructs G.One to give him his H.A.R.T. back, and sends the real Sonia in a malfunctioning [[Mumbai Suburban Railway|local train]]. The train crashes, but G.One saves Sonia and others in time. To save Prateek, he arrives at the game launch venue and fights Ra.One; both reach the third level, with the former left with little power. G.One tricks Ra.One into shooting him without his H.A.R.T. attached. Furious, Ra. One creates ten copies of himself. Prateek, unable to identify the real Ra.One, asks G.One to quote Shekhar: \"If you join the forces of evil, its shadows shall always follow you\". The duo realise that only one of the ten Ra.Ones has a shadow: the original one. G.One shoots and destroys him with the sole bullet, absorbs Ra.One's remains and returns to the virtual world.\n\nSix months later, Prateek and Sonia return to London, where Prateek manages to restore G.One to the real world in remembrance of his late father.\n\n==Cast==\n[[File:Armaan Verma.jpg|160px|thumbnail|right|Armaan Verma plays Prateek, the film's major protagonist]]\n\nThe major characters of ''Ra.One'' were played by [[protagonist]]s [[Shah Rukh Khan]] and [[Kareena Kapoor]] and primary [[antagonist]] [[Arjun Rampal]].
