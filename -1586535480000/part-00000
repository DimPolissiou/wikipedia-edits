Eddie Murphy plays Akeem Joffer, the crown prince of the fictional African nation of Zamunda, who travels to the [[United States]] in the hopes of finding a woman he can marry.\n\nIn 1989, a [[Television pilot|pilot]] for a planned [[spin-off (media)|spin-off]] television series was made, although this was never picked up for a series.<ref name=\"splinter_spinoff\">{{cite web|url=http://splinternews.com/reminder-a-terrible-coming-to-america-tv-pilot-happene-1793852530|title=Reminder: A terrible 'Coming to America' TV pilot happened in 1989|last=Fitzpatrick|first=Molly|date=April 11, 2015|website=[[Splinter News]]|access-date=September 28, 2017}}</ref> A sequel, titled ''[[Coming 2 America]]'', is in production.\n\n==Plot==\nIn the wealthy African nation of Zamunda, [[crown prince]] Akeem Joffer grows weary of his pampered lifestyle on his 21st birthday and wishes to do more for himself. When his parents, King Jaffe and Queen Aoleon, present him with [[Arranged marriage|an arranged bride-to-be]], Akeem takes action. Seeking an independent woman who loves him for himself and not his [[social status]], Akeem and his best friend/personal aide, Semmi, travel to the [[New York City]] [[Borough (New York City)|borough]] of [[Queens]] and rent a squalid [[tenement]] in the neighborhood of [[Long Island City, Queens|Long Island City]] under the guise of poor [[international student|foreign students]]. Beginning their search for Akeem's bride, they end up being invited by some locals to a rally that is raising money for the inner city. During the rally, Akeem encounters Lisa McDowell, who possesses all the qualities he is looking for, and upon his insistence he and Semmi get entry-level jobs working at the local [[fast food restaurant]] called ''McDowell's''\u2014a [[McDonald's]] [[ripoff]]\u2014owned by widower Cleo McDowell, Lisa's father.\n\nAkeem's attempts to win Lisa's love are complicated by Lisa's lazy and obnoxious boyfriend, Darryl Jenks ([[Eriq La Salle]]), whose father owns Soul Glo (a [[Jheri curl]]\u2013like hairstyling aid). After Darryl announces their engagement\u2014without Lisa's consent\u2014to their families, she starts dating Akeem, who claims that he comes from a family of poor goat herders. Meanwhile, although Akeem thrives on hard work and learning how [[commoner]]s live, Semmi is not comfortable with living in such meager conditions. After a dinner date with Lisa is thwarted when Semmi furnishes their apartment with a [[jacuzzi]] and other luxuries, Akeem confiscates his money and donates it to [[Trading Places|two homeless men]]. Semmi wires a telegraph to King Jaffe for more money, prompting the Joffers to travel to Queens and expose his identity as a prince.\n\nCleo, initially disapproving of Akeem as he did not want to see his daughter with a poor man, becomes ecstatic when he discovers that Akeem is actually an extremely wealthy prince after being introduced to the Joffers. When Akeem discovers that his parents have arrived in the United States, he and Lisa take shelter at the McDowell residence where Cleo welcomes them. After Cleo's bond with Akeem is ruined by Darryl's unexpected arrival, Lisa later becomes angry and confused that Akeem lied to her about his identity. Akeem explains that he wanted her to love him for who, not what, he is, even offering to renounce his throne; but Lisa, still hurt and angry, refuses to marry him. Despondent, Akeem resigns himself to the arranged marriage, but as they leave, Jaffe is reprimanded by Aoleon for clinging to outdated traditions instead of thinking of his son's happiness.\n\nAt the wedding procession, a still-heartbroken Akeem becomes surprised when his veiled bride-to-be is Lisa herself. Following the ceremony, they ride happily in a carriage to the cheers of Zamundans. Witnessing such splendor, Lisa is both surprised and touched by the fact that Akeem would have given it up just for her. Akeem offers again to abdicate if she does not want this life, but Lisa playfully declines.\n\n==Cast==\n<!--- bulletted cast per opening credits --->\n* [[Eddie Murphy]] as:\n** Prince Akeem, the prince of Zamunda\n** Randy Watson, a soul singer with the fictional band Sexual Chocolate.\n** Saul, the white Jewish barbershop customer\n** Clarence, the owner of the barber shop.\n* [[Arsenio Hall]] as:\n** Semmi, Akeem's friend\n** Reverend Brown\n** Morris the barber\n** Extremely Ugly Girl, an unattractive female clubgoer.\n* [[James Earl Jones]] as King Jaffe Joffer, Akeem's father and King of Zamunda.\n* [[John Amos]] as Cleo McDowell, Akeem's employer and Lisa's father.\n* [[Madge Sinclair]] as Queen Aoleon, Akeem's mother and the Queen of Zamunda.\n* [[Shari Headley]] as Lisa McDowell, Cleo's older daughter and Akeem's love interest.\n* Paul Bates as Oha, a royal servant.\n* [[Eriq La Salle]] as Darryl Jenks, Lisa's boyfriend whom she eventually breaks up with.\n* [[Frankie Faison]] as the landlord who manages the apartment building where Akeem and Semmi live.\n* [[Vanessa Bell Calloway|Vanessa Bell]] as Imani Izzi, betrothed as Akeem's intended wife.\n* [[Louie Anderson]] as Maurice, a McDowell's employee.\n* Allison Dean as Patrice McDowell, Cleo's younger daughter and Lisa's sister.\n* Sheila Johnson<!--- do not link to the billionaire American businesswoman ---> as a lady-in-waiting.\n* [[Jake Steinfeld]] as a cab driver.\n* [[Calvin Lockhart]] as Colonel Izzi, Imani's father\n* [[Samuel L.

The film also co-stars [[Arsenio Hall]], [[James Earl Jones]], [[Shari Headley]], and [[John Amos]]. The film was released in the United States on June 29, 1988. Eddie Murphy plays Akeem Joffer, the crown prince of the fictional African nation of Zamunda, who travels to the [[United States]] in the hopes of finding a woman he can marry.\n\nIn 1989, a [[Television pilot|pilot]] for a planned [[spin-off (media)|spin-off]] television series was made, although this was never picked up for a series.<ref name=\"splinter_spinoff\">{{cite web|url=http://splinternews.com/reminder-a-terrible-coming-to-america-tv-pilot-happene-1793852530|title=Reminder: A terrible 'Coming to America' TV pilot happened in 1989|last=Fitzpatrick|first=Molly|date=April 11, 2015|website=[[Splinter News]]|access-date=September 28, 2017}}</ref> A sequel, titled ''[[Coming 2 America]]'', is in production.\n\n==Plot==\nIn the wealthy African nation of Zamunda, [[crown prince]] Akeem Joffer grows weary of his pampered lifestyle on his 21st birthday and wishes to do more for himself. When his parents, King Jaffe and Queen Aoleon, present him with [[Arranged marriage|an arranged bride-to-be]], Akeem takes action. Seeking an independent woman who loves him for himself and not his [[social status]], Akeem and his best friend/personal aide, Semmi, travel to the [[New York City]] [[Borough (New York City)|borough]] of [[Queens]] and rent a squalid [[tenement]] in the neighborhood of [[Long Island City, Queens|Long Island City]] under the guise of poor [[international student|foreign students]]. Beginning their search for Akeem's bride, they end up being invited by some locals to a rally that is raising money for the inner city. During the rally, Akeem encounters Lisa McDowell, who possesses all the qualities he is looking for, and upon his insistence he and Semmi get entry-level jobs working at the local [[fast food restaurant]] called ''McDowell's''\u2014a [[McDonald's]] [[ripoff]]\u2014owned by widower Cleo McDowell, Lisa's father.\n\nAkeem's attempts to win Lisa's love are complicated by Lisa's lazy and obnoxious boyfriend, Darryl Jenks ([[Eriq La Salle]]), whose father owns Soul Glo (a [[Jheri curl]]\u2013like hairstyling aid). After Darryl announces their engagement\u2014without Lisa's consent\u2014to their families, she starts dating Akeem, who claims that he comes from a family of poor goat herders. Meanwhile, although Akeem thrives on hard work and learning how [[commoner]]s live, Semmi is not comfortable with living in such meager conditions. After a dinner date with Lisa is thwarted when Semmi furnishes their apartment with a [[jacuzzi]] and other luxuries, Akeem confiscates his money and donates it to [[Trading Places|two homeless men]]. Semmi wires a telegraph to King Jaffe for more money, prompting the Joffers to travel to Queens and expose his identity as a prince.\n\nCleo, initially disapproving of Akeem as he did not want to see his daughter with a poor man, becomes ecstatic when he discovers that Akeem is actually an extremely wealthy prince after being introduced to the Joffers. When Akeem discovers that his parents have arrived in the United States, he and Lisa take shelter at the McDowell residence where Cleo welcomes them. After Cleo's bond with Akeem is ruined by Darryl's unexpected arrival, Lisa later becomes angry and confused that Akeem lied to her about his identity. Akeem explains that he wanted her to love him for who, not what, he is, even offering to renounce his throne; but Lisa, still hurt and angry, refuses to marry him. Despondent, Akeem resigns himself to the arranged marriage, but as they leave, Jaffe is reprimanded by Aoleon for clinging to outdated traditions instead of thinking of his son's happiness.\n\nAt the wedding procession, a still-heartbroken Akeem becomes surprised when his veiled bride-to-be is Lisa herself. Following the ceremony, they ride happily in a carriage to the cheers of Zamundans. Witnessing such splendor, Lisa is both surprised and touched by the fact that Akeem would have given it up just for her. Akeem offers again to abdicate if she does not want this life, but Lisa playfully declines.\n\n==Cast==\n<!--- bulletted cast per opening credits --->\n* [[Eddie Murphy]] as:\n** Prince Akeem, the prince of Zamunda\n** Randy Watson, a soul singer with the fictional band Sexual Chocolate.\n** Saul, the white Jewish barbershop customer\n** Clarence, the owner of the barber shop.\n* [[Arsenio Hall]] as:\n** Semmi, Akeem's friend\n** Reverend Brown\n** Morris the barber\n** Extremely Ugly Girl, an unattractive female clubgoer.\n* [[James Earl Jones]] as King Jaffe Joffer, Akeem's father and King of Zamunda.\n* [[John Amos]] as Cleo McDowell, Akeem's employer and Lisa's father.\n* [[Madge Sinclair]] as Queen Aoleon, Akeem's mother and the Queen of Zamunda.\n* [[Shari Headley]] as Lisa McDowell, Cleo's older daughter and Akeem's love interest.\n* Paul Bates as Oha, a royal servant.\n* [[Eriq La Salle]] as Darryl Jenks, Lisa's boyfriend whom she eventually breaks up with.\n* [[Frankie Faison]] as the landlord who manages the apartment building where Akeem and Semmi live.\n* [[Vanessa Bell Calloway|Vanessa Bell]] as Imani Izzi, betrothed as Akeem's intended wife.\n* [[Louie Anderson]] as Maurice, a McDowell's employee.\n* Allison Dean as Patrice McDowell, Cleo's younger daughter and Lisa's sister.\n* Sheila Johnson<!--- do not link to the billionaire American businesswoman ---> as a lady-in-waiting.\n* [[Jake Steinfeld]] as a cab driver.\n* [[Calvin Lockhart]] as Colonel Izzi, Imani\u2018s father\n* [[Samuel L.
