[[Derek de Solla Price]] \u2013 considered the father of [[scientometrics]] \u2013 predicted that science could reach 'senility' as a result of its own exponential growth.<ref name=\"DeSollaPrice1963\">{{cite book|author1=De Solla Price|author2=Derek J.|year=1963|title=Little science big science|url=https://archive.org/details/littlesciencebig0000pric|url-access=registration|publisher=Columbia University Press}}</ref> Some present day literature seems to vindicate this 'overflow' prophecy, lamenting the decay in both attention and quality.<ref name=\"Siebert-al2015\">{{cite journal|author1=Siebert, S.|author2=Machesky, L.

Ravetz]] predicted in his 1971 book ''[[Scientific Knowledge and Its Social Problems]]'' that science \u2013 in its progression from \"little\" science composed of isolated communities of researchers, to \"big\" science or \"techno-science\" \u2013 would suffer major problems in its internal system of quality control. Ravetz recognized that the incentive structure for modern scientists could become dysfunctional, now known as the present 'publish or perish' challenge, creating [[perverse incentives]] to publish any findings, however dubious. According to Ravetz, quality in science is maintained only when there is a community of scholars linked by a set of shared norms and standards, all of whom are willing and able to hold one another accountable.\n\nHistorian [[Philip Mirowski]] offered a similar diagnosis in his 2011 book ''Science Mart'' (2011).<ref name=\"Mirowski\">{{cite book|author=Mirowski, P.|year=2011|title=Science-Mart: Privatizing American Science|publisher=Harvard University Press}}</ref> In the title, the word 'Mart' is in reference to the retail giant 'Walmart', used by Mirowski as a metaphor for the commodification of science. In Mirowski's analysis, the quality of science collapses when it becomes a commodity being traded in a market. Mirowski argues his case by tracing the decay of science to the decision of major corporations to close their in-house laboratories. They outsourced their work to universities in an effort to reduce costs and increase profits. The corporations subsequently moved their research away from universities to an even cheaper option \u2013 Contract Research Organizations (CRO).\n\nThe crisis of science's quality control system is affecting the use of science for policy.

There are continuing efforts to reform the system of academic incentives, to improve the [[academic peer review|peer review]] process, to reduce the [[misuse of statistics]], to combat [[bias]] in scientific literature, and to increase the overall quality and efficiency of the scientific process.\n\n=== Tackling publication bias with pre-registration of studies ===\n{{Further|Pre-registration (science)|Clinical trial registration}}\n\nA recent innovation in scientific publishing to address the replication crisis is through the use of [[registered report]]s.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Registered Replication Reports|publisher=Association for Psychological Science|url = http://www.psychologicalscience.org/index.php/replication|accessdate = 2015-11-13}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|title = Psychology's 'registration revolution'|url = https://www.theguardian.com/science/head-quarters/2014/may/20/psychology-registration-revolution|newspaper = The Guardian|accessdate = 2015-11-13|first = Chris|last = Chambers|date = 2014-05-20}}</ref> The registered report format requires authors to submit a description of the study methods and analyses prior to data collection. Once the method and analysis plan is vetted through peer-review, publication of the findings is provisionally guaranteed, based on whether the authors follow the proposed protocol. One goal of registered reports is to circumvent the [[publication bias]] toward significant findings that can lead to implementation of questionable research practices and to encourage publication of studies with rigorous methods.\n\nThe journal ''[[Psychological Science (journal)|Psychological Science]]'' has encouraged the preregistration of studies and the reporting of effect sizes and confidence intervals.<ref>{{Cite journal|title = Replication in Psychological Science|journal = Psychological Science|date = 2015-11-09|issn = 0956-7976|pmid = 26553013|pages = 1827\u201332|doi = 10.1177/0956797615616374|first = D.

Some have advocated that Bayesian methods should replace ''p''-values. This has not happened on a wide scale, partly because it is complicated, and partly because many users distrust the specification of prior distributions in the absence of hard data. A simplified version of the Bayesian argument, based on testing a point null hypothesis was suggested by Colquhoun (2014, 2017).<ref name=DC2014>{{cite journal|last1=Colquhoun|first1=David|title=An investigation of the false discovery rate and the misinterpretation of ''p''-values|journal=Royal Society Open Science|year=2015|volume=1|issue=3|page=140216|doi=10.1098/rsos.140216|pmid=26064558|pmc=4448847|arxiv=1407.5296|bibcode=2014RSOS....140216C}}</ref><ref name=\"DC2017\">{{cite journal|last1=Colquhoun|first1=David|title=The reproducibility of research and the misinterpretation of p-values|journal=Royal Society Open Science|volume=4|issue=12|pages=171085|date=2017|doi=10.1098/rsos.171085|pmid=29308247|pmc=5750014}}</ref> The logical problems of inductive inference were discussed in \"The problem with p-values\" (2016).<ref name=\"DC2016\">{{cite web|last1=Colquhoun|first1=David|title=The problem with p-values|url=https://aeon.co/essays/it-s-time-for-science-to-abandon-the-term-statistically-significant|work=Aeon Magazine|accessdate=11 December 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe hazards of reliance on ''p''-values were emphasized by pointing out that even observation of ''p'' = 0.001 was not necessarily strong evidence against the null hypothesis.<ref name=\"DC2017\"/> Despite the fact that the likelihood ratio in favour of the alternative hypothesis over the null is close to 100, if the hypothesis was implausible, with a prior probability of a real effect being 0.1, even the observation of ''p''&nbsp;=&nbsp;0.001 would have a false positive risk of 8 percent. It would not even reach the 5 percent level.\n\nIt was recommended<ref name=\"DC2017\"/> that the terms \"significant\" and \"non-significant\" should not be used. ''p''-values and confidence intervals should still be specified, but they should be accompanied by an indication of the false positive risk. It was suggested that the best way to do this is to calculate the prior probability that would be necessary to believe in order to achieve a false positive risk of, say, 5%.

The rate of successful replication was significantly higher when at least one author of the original study was part of the replication attempt (91.7% relative to 64.6%).\n\nA study published in 2018 in ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature Human Behaviour]]'' sought to replicate 21 social and behavioral science papers from ''Nature'' and ''[[Science (journal)|Science]],'' finding that only 13 could be successfully replicated.<ref>{{Cite journal |url=https://www.wired.com/story/social-science-reproducibility/ |title=The Science Behind Social Science Gets Shaken Up\u2014Again |journal=Wired |language=en |access-date=2018-08-28|last=Roger|first=Adam|date=2018-08-27}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Camerer |first1=Colin F. |authorlink1=Colin Camerer|last2=Dreber |first2=Anna |last3=Holzmeister |first3=Felix |last4=Ho |first4=Teck-Hua |last5=Huber |first5=J\u00fcrgen |last6=Johannesson |first6=Magnus |last7=Kirchler |first7=Michael |last8=Nave |first8=Gideon |last9=Nosek |first9=Brian A. |last10=Pfeiffer |first10=Thomas |last11=Altmejd |first11=Adam |last12=Buttrick |first12=Nick |last13=Chan |first13=Taizan |last14=Chen |first14=Yiling |last15=Forsell |first15=Eskil |last16=Gampa |first16=Anup |last17=Heikensten |first17=Emma |last18=Hummer |first18=Lily |last19=Imai |first19=Taisuke |last20=Isaksson |first20=Siri |last21=Manfredi |first21=Dylan |last22=Rose |first22=Julia |last23=Wagenmakers |first23=Eric-Jan |last24=Wu |first24=Hang |display-authors=2 |title=Evaluating the replicability of social science experiments in Nature and Science between 2010 and 2015 |journal=Nature Human Behaviour |date=27 August 2018 |volume=2 |issue=9 |pages=637\u2013644 |doi=10.1038/s41562-018-0399-z|pmid=31346273 |url=https://authors.library.caltech.edu/91063/2/41562_2018_399_MOESM1_ESM.pdf }}</ref> Similarly, in a study conducted under the auspices of the [[Center for Open Science]], a team of 186 researchers from 60 different laboratories (representing 36 different nationalities from 6 different continents) conducted replications of 28 classic and contemporary findings in psychology.<ref name=\"Many Labs 2\">{{cite journal |last1=Klein |first1=R.A. |title=Many Labs 2: Investigating Variation in Replicability Across Samples and Settings |journal=Advances in Methods and Practices in Psychological Science |date=2018 |volume=1 |issue=4 |pages=443\u2013490 |doi=10.1177/2515245918810225 }}</ref> The focus of the study was not only on whether or not the findings from the original papers replicated, but also on the extent to which findings varied as a function of variations in samples and contexts.

Ravetz]] predicted in his 1971 book ''[[Scientific Knowledge and Its Social Problems]]'' that science \u2013 in its progression from \"little\" science composed of isolated communities of researchers, to \"big\" science or \"techno-science\" \u2013 would suffer major problems in its internal system of quality control. Ravetz recognized that the incentive structure for modern scientists could become dysfunctional, now known as the present 'publish or perish' challenge, creating [[perverse incentives]] to publish any findings, however dubious. According to Ravetz, quality in science is maintained only when there is a community of scholars linked by a set of shared norms and standards, all of whom are willing and able to hold one another accountable.\n\nHistorian [[Philip Mirowski]] offered a similar diagnosis in his 2011 book ''Science Mart'' (2011).<ref name=\"Mirowski\">{{cite book|author=Mirowski, P.|year=2011|title=Science-Mart: Privatizing American Science|publisher=Harvard University Press}}</ref> In the title, the word 'Mart' is in reference to the retail giant 'Walmart', used by Mirowski as a metaphor for the commodification of science. In Mirowski's analysis, the quality of science collapses when it becomes a commodity being traded in a market. Mirowski argues his case by tracing the decay of science to the decision of major corporations to close their in-house laboratories.
