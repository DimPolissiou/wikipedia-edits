It is a ''network of networks'' that consists of private, public, academic, business, and government networks of local to global scope, linked by a broad array of electronic, wireless, and optical networking technologies. The Internet carries a vast range of information resources and services, such as the inter-linked [[hypertext]] documents and [[Web application|applications]] of the [[World Wide Web]] (WWW), [[email|electronic mail]], [[voice over IP|telephony]], and [[file sharing]].\n\nThe origins of the Internet date back to the development of [[packet switching]] and research commissioned by the [[United States Department of Defense]] in the 1960s to enable [[time-sharing]] of mainframe computers.<ref>{{Cite news|last=|first=|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/sf/business/2015/05/30/net-of-insecurity-part-1/|title=A Flaw In The Design|date=May 30, 2015|work=The Washington Post|access-date=|url-status=live|quote=The Internet was born of a big idea: Messages could be chopped into chunks, sent through a network in a series of transmissions, then reassembled by destination computers quickly and efficiently.

The technical underpinning and standardization of the core protocols ([[IPv4]] and [[IPv6]]) is an activity of the [[Internet Engineering Task Force]] (IETF), a non-profit organization of loosely affiliated international participants that anyone may associate with by contributing technical expertise. To maintain interoperability, the principal [[name space]]s of the Internet are administered by the [[Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers]] (ICANN). ICANN is governed by an international board of directors drawn from across the Internet technical, business, academic, and other non-commercial communities. ICANN coordinates the assignment of unique identifiers for use on the Internet, including [[domain name]]s, Internet Protocol (IP) addresses, application port numbers in the transport protocols, and many other parameters. Globally unified name spaces are essential for maintaining the global reach of the Internet.  This role of ICANN distinguishes it as perhaps the only central coordinating body for the global Internet.<ref>Klein, Hans. (2004).

As with any computer network, the Internet physically consists of [[router (computing)|router]]s, media (such as cabling and radio links), repeaters, modems etc. However, as an example of [[internetworking]], many of the network nodes are not necessarily internet equipment per se, the internet packets are carried by other full-fledged networking protocols with the Internet acting as a homogeneous networking standard, running across [[heterogeneous]] hardware, with the packets guided to their destinations by IP routers.\n\n=== Routing and service tiers ===\n[[File:Internet Connectivity Distribution & Core.svg|thumb|Packet routing across the Internet involves several tiers of Internet service providers.]]\n\n[[Internet service provider]]s (ISPs) establish the worldwide connectivity between individual networks at various levels of scope. End-users who only access the Internet when needed to perform a function or obtain information, represent the bottom of the routing hierarchy. At the top of the routing hierarchy are the [[tier 1 network]]s, large telecommunication companies that exchange traffic directly with each other via very high speed [[fibre optic cable]]s and governed by [[peering]] agreements. [[Tier 2 network|Tier 2]] and lower level networks buy [[Internet transit]] from other providers to reach at least some parties on the global Internet, though they may also engage in peering. An ISP may use a single upstream provider for connectivity, or implement [[multihoming]] to achieve redundancy and load balancing. [[Internet exchange point]]s are major traffic exchanges with physical connections to multiple ISPs. Large organizations, such as academic institutions, large enterprises, and governments, may perform the same function as ISPs, engaging in peering and purchasing transit on behalf of their internal networks. Research networks tend to interconnect with large subnetworks such as [[GEANT]], [[GLORIAD]], [[Internet2]], and the UK's [[national research and education network]], [[JANET]]. Both the Internet IP routing structure and hypertext links of the World Wide Web are examples of [[scale-free network]]s.<ref>{{cite journal\n |last=A. L. Barab'asi\n |first=R.

This is a model architecture that divides methods into a [[Communication protocol#Layering|layered system of protocols]], originally documented in {{IETF RFC|1122}} and {{IETF RFC|1123}}.\n\n===Layers===\nThe software layers correspond to the environment or scope in which their services operate. At the top is the [[application layer]], space for the application-specific networking methods used in software applications. For example, a web browser program uses the [[client-server]] application model and a specific protocol of interaction between servers and clients, while many file-sharing systems use a [[peer-to-peer]] paradigm.\n\nBelow this top layer, the [[transport layer]] connects applications on different hosts with a logical channel through the network with appropriate data exchange methods. It provides several services including ordered, reliable delivery (TCP), and an unreliable datagram service (UDP).\n\nUnderlying these layers are the networking technologies that interconnect networks at their borders and exchange traffic across them. The [[Internet layer]] implements the [[Internet Protocol]] which enables computers to identify and locate each other by [[IP address|Internet Protocol (IP) addresses]], and route their traffic via intermediate (transit) networks.<ref>RFC 791, ''Internet Protocol, DARPA Internet Program Protocol Specification'', Information Sciences Institute, Sept. 1981</ref> The internet protocol layer code is independent of the type of network that it is physically running over.\n\nAt the bottom of the architecture is the [[link layer]], which provides logical connectivity between hosts. The link layer code is usually the only software part customized to the type of physical networking link protocol. Many link layers have been implemented and each operates over a type of network link, such as within a [[local area network]] (LAN) or [[wide area network]] (e.g. [[Wi-Fi]] or [[Ethernet]] or a [[Dial-up Internet access|dial-up connection]], [[Asynchronous transfer mode|ATM]] etc.).\n\n[[File:UDP encapsulation.svg|thumb|As user data is processed through the protocol stack, each abstraction layer adds encapsulation information at the sending host. Data is transmitted ''over the wire'' at the link level between hosts and routers. Encapsulation is removed by the receiving host. Intermediate relays update link encapsulation at each hop, and inspect the IP layer for routing purposes.]]\n\n===Internet protocol===\n[[Image:IP stack connections.svg|thumb|Conceptual data flow in a simple network topology of two hosts (''A'' and ''B'') connected by a link between their respective routers. The application on each host executes read and write operations as if the processes were directly connected to each other by some kind of data pipe. After establishment of this pipe, most details of the communication are hidden from each process, as the underlying principles of communication are implemented in the lower protocol layers. In analogy, at the transport layer the communication appears as host-to-host, without knowledge of the application data structures and the connecting routers, while at the internetworking layer, individual network boundaries are traversed at each router.]]\nThe most prominent component of the Internet model is the Internet Protocol (IP). IP enables internetworking and, in essence, establishes the Internet itself. Two versions of the Internet Protocol exist, IPV4 and IPV6.\n\n====IP Addresses====\n[[File:An example of theoretical DNS recursion.svg|right|thumb|A DNS resolver consults three name servers to resolve the domain name user-visible \"www.wikipedia.org\" to determine the IPV4 Address 207.142.131.234]]\nFor locating individual computers on the network, the Internet provides [[IP address]]es. IP addresses are used by the Internet infrastructure to direct internet packets to their destinations. They consist of fixed-length numbers, which are found within the packet. IP addresses are generally assigned to equipment either automatically via [[DHCP]], or are configured.\n\nHowever the network also supports other addressing systems. Users generally enter [[fully qualified domain name|domain name]]s (e.g. \"en.wikipedia.org\") instead of IP addresses because they are easier to remember, they are converted by the [[Domain Name System]] (DNS) into IP addresses which are more efficient for routing purposes.\n\n====IPv4====\n[[IPv4|Internet Protocol version 4]] (IPv4) defines an IP address as a [[32-bit]] number.<ref name=rfc791>{{Cite IETF|rfc=791|title=Internet Protocol, DARPA Internet Program Protocol Specification|editor=[[Jon Postel|J.

In essence, it establishes a parallel version of the Internet not directly accessible with IPv4 software. Thus, translation facilities must exist for internetworking or nodes must have duplicate networking software for both networks. Essentially all modern computer operating systems support both versions of the Internet Protocol. Network infrastructure, however, has been lagging in this development. Aside from the complex array of physical connections that make up its infrastructure, the Internet is facilitated by bi- or multi-lateral commercial contracts, e.g., [[peering agreement]]s, and by technical specifications or protocols that describe the exchange of data over the network. Indeed, the Internet is defined by its interconnections and routing policies.\n\n====Subnetwork====\n[[File:Subnetting Concept-en.svg|thumb|300px|right|Creating a subnet by dividing the host identifier]]\nA ''[[subnetwork]]'' or ''subnet'' is a logical subdivision of an [[IP network]].<ref name=\"rfc950\">{{Cite IETF\n    | rfc         = 950\n    | publisher   = [[IETF]]\n    | author1     = Jeffrey Mogul\n    | author2     = Jon Postel\n    | authorlink2 = Jon Postel\n    | title       = Internet Standard Subnetting Procedure\n    | date        = August 1985\n  }} Updated by RFC 6918.</ref>{{rp|1,16}} The practice of dividing a network into two or more networks is called ''subnetting''.\n\nComputers that belong to a subnet are addressed with an identical [[most-significant bit]]-group in their [[IP address]]es. This results in the logical division of an IP address into two fields, the ''network number'' or ''routing prefix'' and the ''rest field'' or ''host identifier''. The ''rest field'' is an identifier for a specific [[Host (network)|host]] or network interface.\n\nThe ''routing prefix'' may be expressed in [[Classless Inter-Domain Routing]] (CIDR) notation written as the first address of a network, followed by a slash character (''/''), and ending with the bit-length of the prefix. For example, {{IPaddr|198.51.100.0|24}} is the prefix of the [[Internet Protocol version 4]] network starting at the given address, having 24 bits allocated for the network prefix, and the remaining 8 bits reserved for host addressing. Addresses in the range {{IPaddr|198.51.100.0}} to {{IPaddr|198.51.100.255}} belong to this network. The [[IPv6]] address specification {{IPaddr|2001:db8::|32}} is a large address block with 2<sup>96</sup> addresses, having a 32-bit routing prefix.\n\nFor IPv4, a network may also be characterized by its ''subnet mask'' or ''netmask'', which is the [[bitmask]] that when applied by a [[bitwise AND]] operation to any IP address in the network, yields the routing prefix. Subnet masks are also expressed in [[dot-decimal notation]] like an address. For example, {{IPaddr|255.255.255.0}} is the subnet mask for the prefix {{IPaddr|198.51.100.0|24}}.\n\nTraffic is exchanged between subnetworks through [[router (computing)|routers]] when the routing prefixes of the source address and the destination address differ. A router serves as a logical or physical boundary between the subnets.\n\nThe benefits of subnetting an existing network vary with each deployment scenario. In the address allocation architecture of the Internet using CIDR and in large organizations, it is necessary to allocate address space efficiently. Subnetting may also enhance routing efficiency, or have advantages in network management when subnetworks are administratively controlled by different entities in a larger organization.  Subnets may be arranged logically in a hierarchical architecture, partitioning an organization's network address space into a tree-like routing structure.\n\n===IETF===\nWhile the hardware components in the Internet infrastructure can often be used to support other software systems, it is the design and the standardization process of the software that characterizes the Internet and provides the foundation for its scalability and success. The responsibility for the architectural design of the Internet software systems has been assumed by the [[Internet Engineering Task Force]] (IETF).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ietf.org/ |title=IETF Home Page |publisher=Ietf.org |accessdate=20 June 2009 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090618032558/http://www.ietf.org/ |archivedate=18 June 2009 |df= }}</ref> The IETF conducts standard-setting work groups, open to any individual, about the various aspects of Internet architecture. Resulting contributions and standards are published as ''[[Request for Comments]]'' (RFC) documents on the IETF web site. The principal methods of networking that enable the Internet are contained in specially designated RFCs that constitute the [[Internet Standard]]s. Other less rigorous documents are simply informative, experimental, or historical, or document the best current practices (BCP) when implementing Internet technologies.\n\n== Applications and services ==\nThe Internet carries many [[network service|applications and services]], most prominently the [[World Wide Web]], including [[social media]], [[electronic mail]], [[mobile app]]lications, [[multiplayer online game]]s, [[Internet telephony]], [[file sharing]], and [[streaming media]] services.\n\nMost [[Server (computing)|servers]] that provide these services are today hosted in [[data center]]s, and content is often accessed through high-performance [[content delivery network]]s.\n\n=== World Wide Web ===\n[[File:First Web Server.jpg|thumb|This [[NeXT Computer]] was used by [[Tim Berners-Lee]] at [[CERN]] and became the world's first [[Web server]].]]\n\nThe [[World Wide Web]] is a global collection of [[documents]], [[Computer graphics|images]], [[multimedia]], applications, and other resources, logically interrelated by [[hyperlink]]s and referenced with [[Uniform Resource Identifier]]s (URIs), which provide a global system of named references. URIs symbolically identify services, [[web servers]], databases, and the documents and resources that they can provide. [[Hypertext Transfer Protocol]] (HTTP) is the main access protocol of the World Wide Web. [[Web service]]s also use HTTP for communication between software systems for information transfer, sharing and exchanging business data and logistic and is one of many languages or protocols that can be used for communication on the Internet.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.webopedia.com/DidYouKnow/Internet/Web_vs_Internet.asp |title=The Difference Between the Internet and the World Wide Web |publisher=QuinStreet Inc. |work=Webopedia.com |date=2010-06-24 |accessdate=2014-05-01 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140502001005/http://www.webopedia.com/DidYouKnow/Internet/Web_vs_Internet.asp |archivedate=2 May 2014 |df= }}</ref>\n\nWorld Wide Web browser software, such as [[Microsoft]]'s [[Internet Explorer]]/[[Microsoft Edge|Edge]], [[Mozilla Firefox]], [[Opera (web browser)|Opera]], [[Apple Inc.|Apple]]'s [[Safari (web browser)|Safari]], and [[Google Chrome]], lets users navigate from one web page to another via the hyperlinks embedded in the documents. These documents may also contain any combination of [[computer data]], including graphics, sounds, [[Plain text|text]], [[web video|video]], [[multimedia]] and interactive content that runs while the user is interacting with the page. [[Client-side scripting|Client-side software]] can include animations, [[web game|games]], [[office applications]] and scientific demonstrations. Through [[keyword (Internet search)|keyword]]-driven [[Internet research]] using [[Web search engine|search engines]] like [[Yahoo! Search|Yahoo!]], [[Bing (search engine)|Bing]] and [[Google Search|Google]], users worldwide have easy, instant access to a vast and diverse amount of online information. Compared to printed media, books, encyclopedias and traditional libraries, the World Wide Web has enabled the decentralization of information on a large scale.\n\nThe Web has enabled individuals and organizations to [[publish]] ideas and information to a potentially large [[audience]] online at greatly reduced expense and time delay. Publishing a web page, a blog, or building a website involves little initial [[cost]] and many cost-free services are available. However, publishing and maintaining large, professional web sites with attractive, diverse and up-to-date information is still a difficult and expensive proposition. Many individuals and some companies and groups use ''web logs'' or blogs, which are largely used as easily updatable online diaries. Some commercial organizations encourage [[employees|staff]] to communicate advice in their areas of specialization in the hope that visitors will be impressed by the expert knowledge and free information, and be attracted to the corporation as a result.\n\n[[Online advertising|Advertising]] on popular web pages can be lucrative, and [[e-commerce]], which is the sale of products and services directly via the Web, continues to grow. Online advertising is a form of [[marketing]] and advertising which uses the Internet to deliver [[promotion (marketing)|promotional]] marketing messages to consumers.  It includes email marketing, [[search engine marketing]] (SEM), social media marketing, many types of [[display advertising]] (including [[web banner]] advertising), and [[mobile advertising]]. In 2011, Internet advertising revenues in the United States surpassed those of [[cable television]] and nearly exceeded those of [[broadcast television]].<ref name=\"IAB2012\">{{cite web |url = http://www.iab.net/media/file/IAB_Internet_Advertising_Revenue_Report_FY_2012_rev.pdf |title = IAB Internet advertising revenue report: 2012 full year results |date = April 2013 |publisher = PricewaterhouseCoopers, Internet Advertising Bureau |accessdate = 12 June 2013 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20141004001439/http://www.iab.net/media/file/IAB_Internet_Advertising_Revenue_Report_FY_2012_rev.pdf |archive-date = 4 October 2014 |url-status = live }}</ref>{{rp|19}} Many common online advertising practices are controversial and increasingly subject to regulation.\n\nWhen the Web developed in the 1990s, a typical web page was stored in completed form on a web server, formatted in [[HTML]], complete for transmission to a web browser in response to a request. Over time, the process of creating and serving web pages has become dynamic, creating a flexible design, layout, and content. Websites are often created using [[content management]] software with, initially, very little content. Contributors to these systems, who may be paid staff, members of an organization or the public, fill underlying databases with content using editing pages designed for that purpose while casual visitors view and read this content in HTML form. There may or may not be editorial, approval and security systems built into the process of taking newly entered content and making it available to the target visitors.\n\n=== Communication ===\n[[Email]] is an important communications service available on the Internet. The concept of sending electronic text messages between parties in a way analogous to mailing letters or memos predates the creation of the Internet.<ref>Ron Brown, Fax invades the mail market, [https://books.google.com/books?id=Ry64sjvOmLkC&pg=PA218 New Scientist] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160509050238/https://books.google.com/books?id=Ry64sjvOmLkC&pg=PA218 |date=2016-05-09 }}, Vol. 56, No. 817 (Oct., 26, 1972), pp. 218\u201321.</ref><ref>Herbert P.

Emails can be [[Carbon copy|cc-ed]] to multiple [[email address]]es.\n\n[[Internet telephony]] is another common communications service made possible by the creation of the Internet. [[VoIP]] stands for Voice-over-[[Internet Protocol]], referring to the protocol that underlies all Internet communication. The idea began in the early 1990s with [[walkie-talkie]]-like voice applications for personal computers. In recent years many VoIP systems have become as easy to use and as convenient as a normal telephone. The benefit is that, as the Internet carries the voice traffic, VoIP can be free or cost much less than a traditional telephone call, especially over long distances and especially for those with always-on Internet connections such as [[Cable modem|cable]] or [[ADSL]] and [[mobile data]].<ref name=EBSCOhost>{{cite journal|last=Booth|first=C|title=Chapter 2: IP Phones, Software VoIP, and Integrated and Mobile VoIP|journal=Library Technology Reports|year=2010|volume=46|issue=5|pages=11\u201319}}</ref> VoIP is maturing into a competitive alternative to traditional telephone service. Interoperability between different providers has improved and the ability to call or receive a call from a traditional telephone is available. Simple, inexpensive VoIP network adapters are available that eliminate the need for a personal computer.\n\nVoice quality can still vary from call to call, but is often equal to and can even exceed that of traditional calls. Remaining problems for VoIP include [[emergency telephone number]] dialing and reliability. Currently,{{When|date=March 2020}} a few VoIP providers provide an emergency service, but it is not universally available. Older traditional phones with no \"extra features\" may be line-powered only and operate during a power failure; VoIP can never do so without a [[uninterruptible power supply|backup power source]] for the phone equipment and the Internet access devices. VoIP has also become increasingly popular for gaming applications, as a form of communication between players. Popular VoIP clients for gaming include [[Ventrilo]] and [[Teamspeak]]. Modern video game consoles also offer VoIP chat features.\n\n=== Data transfer ===\n[[File sharing]] is an example of transferring large amounts of data across the Internet. A [[computer file]] can be emailed to customers, colleagues and friends as an attachment. It can be uploaded to a website or [[File Transfer Protocol]] (FTP) server for easy download by others. It can be put into a \"shared location\" or onto a [[file server]] for instant use by colleagues. The load of bulk downloads to many users can be eased by the use of \"[[Web mirror|mirror]]\" servers or [[peer-to-peer]] networks. In any of these cases, access to the file may be controlled by user [[authentication]], the transit of the file over the Internet may be obscured by [[encryption]], and money may change hands for access to the file. The price can be paid by the remote charging of funds from, for example, a credit card whose details are also passed \u2013 usually fully encrypted \u2013 across the Internet. The origin and authenticity of the file received may be checked by [[digital signature]]s or by [[MD5]] or other message digests. These simple features of the Internet, over a worldwide basis, are changing the production, sale, and distribution of anything that can be reduced to a computer file for transmission. This includes all manner of print publications, software products, news, music, film, video, photography, graphics and the other arts. This in turn has caused seismic shifts in each of the existing industries that previously controlled the production and distribution of these products.\n\n[[Streaming media]] is the real-time delivery of digital media for the immediate consumption or enjoyment by end users. Many radio and television broadcasters provide Internet feeds of their live audio and video productions. They may also allow time-shift viewing or listening such as Preview, Classic Clips and Listen Again features. These providers have been joined by a range of pure Internet \"broadcasters\" who never had on-air licenses. This means that an Internet-connected device, such as a computer or something more specific, can be used to access on-line media in much the same way as was previously possible only with a television or radio receiver. The range of available types of content is much wider, from specialized technical [[webcast]]s to on-demand popular multimedia services. [[Podcast]]ing is a variation on this theme, where \u2013 usually audio \u2013 material is downloaded and played back on a computer or shifted to a [[portable media player]] to be listened to on the move. These techniques using simple equipment allow anybody, with little censorship or licensing control, to broadcast audio-visual material worldwide.\n\nDigital media streaming increases the demand for network bandwidth.  For example, standard image quality needs 1 Mbit/s link speed for SD 480p, HD 720p quality requires 2.5 Mbit/s, and the top-of-the-line HDX quality needs 4.5 Mbit/s for 1080p.<ref>{{cite web |last=Morrison |first=Geoff |url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/40241749 |title=What to know before buying a 'connected' TV \u2013 Technology & science \u2013 Tech and gadgets \u2013 Tech Holiday Guide |publisher=NBC News |date=18 November 2010 |accessdate=8 August 2011 |df= |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200212091603/http://www.nbcnews.com/id/40241749 |archive-date=12 February 2020 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n[[Webcam]]s are a low-cost extension of this phenomenon. While some webcams can give full-frame-rate video, the picture either is usually small or updates slowly. Internet users can watch animals around an African waterhole, ships in the [[Panama Canal]], traffic at a local roundabout or monitor their own premises, live and in real time. Video [[chat rooms]] and [[video conferencing]] are also popular with many uses being found for personal webcams, with and without two-way sound. YouTube was founded on 15 February 2005 and is now the leading website for free streaming video with a vast number of users. It uses an HTML5 based web player by default to stream and show video files.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://youtube-eng.googleblog.com/2015/01/youtube-now-defaults-to-html5_27.html|title=YouTube now defaults to HTML5 <video>|work=YouTube Engineering and Developers Blog|access-date=2018-09-10|language=en-US|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180910204225/https://youtube-eng.googleblog.com/2015/01/youtube-now-defaults-to-html5_27.html|archive-date=10 September 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> Registered users may upload an unlimited amount of video and build their own personal profile.

The Internet can be accessed almost anywhere by numerous means, including through [[mobile Internet device]]s. Mobile phones, [[datacard]]s, [[handheld game console]]s and [[cellular router]]s allow users to connect to the Internet [[wireless]]ly. Within the limitations imposed by small screens and other limited facilities of such pocket-sized devices, the services of the Internet, including email and the web, may be available. Service providers may restrict the services offered and mobile data charges may be significantly higher than other access methods.\n\nEducational material at all levels from pre-school to post-doctoral is available from websites. Examples range from [[CBeebies]], through school and high-school revision guides and [[Virtual university|virtual universities]], to access to top-end scholarly literature through the likes of [[Google Scholar]]. For [[distance education]], help with [[homework]] and other assignments, self-guided learning, whiling away spare time, or just looking up more detail on an interesting fact, it has never been easier for people to access educational information at any level from anywhere. The Internet in general and the [[World Wide Web]] in particular are important enablers of both [[Education|formal]] and [[informal education]]. Further, the Internet allows universities, in particular, researchers from the social and behavioral sciences, to conduct research remotely via virtual laboratories, with profound changes in reach and generalizability of findings as well as in communication between scientists and in the publication of results.<ref>Reips, U.-D.

Not only can a group cheaply communicate and share ideas but the wide reach of the Internet allows such groups more easily to form. An example of this is the [[free software movement]], which has produced, among other things, [[Linux]], [[Mozilla Firefox]], and [[OpenOffice.org]] (later forked into [[LibreOffice]]). Internet chat, whether using an [[IRC]] chat room, an [[instant messaging]] system, or a [[social networking]] website, allows colleagues to stay in touch in a very convenient way while working at their computers during the day.  Messages can be exchanged even more quickly and conveniently than via email. These systems may allow files to be exchanged, drawings and images to be shared, or voice and video contact between team members.\n\n[[Content management]] systems allow collaborating teams to work on shared sets of documents simultaneously without accidentally destroying each other's work. Business and project teams can share calendars as well as documents and other information. Such collaboration occurs in a wide variety of areas including scientific research, software development, conference planning, political activism and creative writing. Social and political collaboration is also becoming more widespread as both Internet access and [[computer literacy]] spread.\n\nThe Internet allows computer users to remotely access other computers and information stores easily from any access point. Access may be with [[computer security]], i.e. authentication and encryption technologies, depending on the requirements. This is encouraging new ways of working from home, collaboration and information sharing in many industries. An accountant sitting at home can [[audit]] the books of a company based in another country, on a [[server (computing)|server]] situated in a third country that is remotely maintained by IT specialists in a fourth. These accounts could have been created by home-working bookkeepers, in other remote locations, based on information emailed to them from offices all over the world. Some of these things were possible before the widespread use of the Internet, but the cost of private [[leased line]]s would have made many of them infeasible in practice. An office worker away from their desk, perhaps on the other side of the world on a business trip or a holiday, can access their emails, access their data using [[cloud computing]], or open a [[Remote Desktop Protocol|remote desktop]] session into their office PC using a secure [[virtual private network]] (VPN) connection on the Internet. This can give the worker complete access to all of their normal files and data, including email and other applications, while away from the office. It has been referred to among [[system administrator]]s as the Virtual Private Nightmare,<ref>{{cite web|title=The Virtual Private Nightmare: VPN |url=http://librenix.com/?inode=5013 |publisher=Librenix |accessdate=21 July 2010 |date=4 August 2004 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110515152637/http://librenix.com/?inode=5013 |archivedate=15 May 2011 |df= }}</ref> because it extends the secure perimeter of a corporate network into remote locations and its employees' homes.\n\n=== Social networking and entertainment ===\n{{See also|Social networking service#Social impact}}\nMany people use the World Wide Web to access news, weather and sports reports, to plan and book vacations and to pursue their personal interests. People use [[online chat|chat]], messaging and email to make and stay in touch with friends worldwide, sometimes in the same way as some previously had [[pen pal]]s. [[Social network service|Social networking]] websites such as [[Facebook]], [[Twitter]], and [[Myspace]] have created new ways to socialize and interact. Users of these sites are able to add a wide variety of information to pages, to pursue common interests, and to connect with others. It is also possible to find existing acquaintances, to allow communication among existing groups of people. Sites like [[LinkedIn]] foster commercial and business connections. YouTube and [[Flickr]] specialize in users' videos and photographs. While social networking sites were initially for individuals only, today they are widely used by businesses and other organizations to promote their brands, to market to their customers and to encourage posts to \"[[Viral marketing|go viral]]\". \"Black hat\" social media techniques are also employed by some organizations, such as [[Spamming|spam]] accounts and [[astroturfing]].\n\nA risk for both individuals and organizations writing posts (especially public posts) on social networking websites, is that especially foolish or controversial posts occasionally lead to an unexpected and possibly large-scale backlash on social media from other Internet users. This is also a risk in relation to controversial ''offline'' behavior, if it is widely made known. The nature of this backlash can range widely from counter-arguments and public mockery, through insults and [[hate speech]], to, in extreme cases, rape and death [[Computer crime#Threats|threats]]. The [[online disinhibition effect]] describes the tendency of many individuals to behave more stridently or offensively online than they would in person. A significant number of [[feminist]] women have been the target of various forms of [[harassment]] in response to posts they have made on social media, and Twitter in particular has been criticised in the past for not doing enough to aid victims of online abuse.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-23477130 |title=Twitter 'report abuse' button calls after rape threats |last=Moore |first=Keith |date=27 July 2013 |work=[[BBC News]] |accessdate=7 December 2014 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140904014545/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-23477130 |archivedate=4 September 2014 |df= }}</ref>\n\nFor organizations, such a backlash can cause overall [[public relations|brand damage]], especially if reported by the media. However, this is not always the case, as any brand damage in the eyes of people with an opposing opinion to that presented by the organization could sometimes be outweighed by strengthening the brand in the eyes of others. Furthermore, if an organization or individual gives in to demands that others perceive as wrong-headed, that can then provoke a counter-backlash.\n\nSome websites, such as [[Reddit]], have rules forbidding the posting of [[personal information]] of individuals (also known as [[doxxing]]), due to concerns about such postings leading to mobs of large numbers of Internet users directing harassment at the specific individuals thereby identified. In particular, the Reddit rule forbidding the posting of personal information is widely understood to imply that all identifying photos and names must be [[censored]] in Facebook [[screenshots]] posted to Reddit. However, the interpretation of this rule in relation to public Twitter posts is less clear, and in any case, like-minded people online have many other ways they can use to direct each other's attention to public social media posts they disagree with.\n\nChildren also face dangers online such as [[cyberbullying]] and [[Child grooming|approaches by sexual predators]], who sometimes pose as children themselves. Children may also encounter material which they may find upsetting, or material which their parents consider to be not age-appropriate. Due to naivety, they may also post personal information about themselves online, which could put them or their families at risk unless warned not to do so. Many parents choose to enable [[Content-control software|Internet filtering]], and/or supervise their children's online activities, in an attempt to protect their children from inappropriate material on the Internet. The most popular social networking websites, such as Facebook and Twitter, commonly forbid users under the age of 13. However, these policies are typically trivial to circumvent by registering an account with a false birth date, and a significant number of children aged under 13 join such sites anyway. Social networking sites for younger children, which claim to provide better levels of protection for children, also exist.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mashable.com/2010/10/11/social-networks-children/ |title=5 Fun and Safe Social Networks for Children |date=11 October 2010 |accessdate=7 December 2014 |website=[[Mashable]] |last=Kessler |first=Sarah |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141220082237/http://mashable.com/2010/10/11/social-networks-children/ |archivedate=20 December 2014 |df= }}</ref>\n\nThe Internet has been a major outlet for leisure activity since its inception, with entertaining [[social experiment]]s such as [[MUD]]s and [[MOO]]s being conducted on university servers, and humor-related [[Usenet]] groups receiving much traffic.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}} Many [[Internet forums]] have sections devoted to games and funny videos.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}} The [[Internet pornography]] and [[online gambling]] industries have taken advantage of the World Wide Web.

Kiva raises funds for local intermediary [[microfinance]] organizations which post stories and updates on behalf of the borrowers. Lenders can contribute as little as $25 to loans of their choice, and receive their money back as borrowers repay. Kiva falls short of being a pure peer-to-peer charity, in that loans are disbursed before being funded by lenders and borrowers do not communicate with lenders themselves.<ref>[http://blogs.cgdev.org/open_book/2009/10/kiva-is-not-quite-what-it-seems.php ''Kiva Is Not Quite What It Seems''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100210045011/http://blogs.cgdev.org/open_book/2009/10/kiva-is-not-quite-what-it-seems.php |date=10 February 2010 }}, by David Roodman, Center for Global Development, 2 October 2009, as accessed  2 & 16 January 2010</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Strom |first=Stephanie |title=Confusion on Where Money Lent via Kiva Goes |work=The New York Times |page=6 |date=9 November 2009 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/09/business/global/09kiva.html |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170129225155/http://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/09/business/global/09kiva.html |archivedate=29 January 2017 |df= }}</ref>\n\n== Security ==\n{{Main|Internet security}}\nInternet resources, hardware, and software components are the target of criminal or malicious attempts to gain unauthorized control to cause interruptions, commit fraud, engage in blackmail or access private information.\n\n===Malware===\n[[Malware]] is malicious software used and distributed via the Internet.

[[Packet Capture Appliance]] intercepts these packets as they are traveling through the network, in order to examine their contents using other programs. A packet capture is an information ''gathering'' tool, but not an ''analysis'' tool. That is it gathers \"messages\" but it does not analyze them and figure out what they mean. Other programs are needed to perform [[traffic analysis]] and sift through intercepted data looking for important/useful information.

The technical underpinning and standardization of the core protocols ([[IPv4]] and [[IPv6]]) is an activity of the [[Internet Engineering Task Force]] (IETF), a non-profit organization of loosely affiliated international participants that anyone may associate with by contributing technical expertise. To maintain interoperability, the principal [[name space]]s of the Internet are administered by the [[Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers]] (ICANN). ICANN is governed by an international board of directors drawn from across the Internet technical, business, academic, and other non-commercial communities. ICANN coordinates the assignment of unique identifiers for use on the Internet, including [[domain name]]s, Internet Protocol (IP) addresses, application port numbers in the transport protocols, and many other parameters. Globally unified name spaces are essential for maintaining the global reach of the Internet.

As with any computer network, the Internet physically consists of [[router (computing)|router]]s, media (such as cabling and radio links), repeaters, modems etc. However, as an example of [[internetworking]], many of the network nodes are not necessarily internet equipment per se, the internet packets are carried by other full-fledged networking protocols with the Internet acting as a homogeneous networking standard, running across [[heterogeneous]] hardware, with the packets guided to their destinations by IP routers.\n\n=== Routing and service tiers ===\n[[File:Internet Connectivity Distribution & Core.svg|thumb|Packet routing across the Internet involves several tiers of Internet service providers.]]\n\n[[Internet service provider]]s (ISPs) establish the worldwide connectivity between individual networks at various levels of scope. End-users who only access the Internet when needed to perform a function or obtain information, represent the bottom of the routing hierarchy. At the top of the routing hierarchy are the [[tier 1 network]]s, large telecommunication companies that exchange traffic directly with each other via very high speed [[fibre optic cable]]s and governed by [[peering]] agreements. [[Tier 2 network|Tier 2]] and lower level networks buy [[Internet transit]] from other providers to reach at least some parties on the global Internet, though they may also engage in peering. An ISP may use a single upstream provider for connectivity, or implement [[multihoming]] to achieve redundancy and load balancing. [[Internet exchange point]]s are major traffic exchanges with physical connections to multiple ISPs. Large organizations, such as academic institutions, large enterprises, and governments, may perform the same function as ISPs, engaging in peering and purchasing transit on behalf of their internal networks. Research networks tend to interconnect with large subnetworks such as [[GEANT]], [[GLORIAD]], [[Internet2]], and the UK's [[national research and education network]], [[JANET]]. Both the Internet IP routing structure and hypertext links of the World Wide Web are examples of [[scale-free network]]s.<ref>{{cite journal\n |last=A. L. Barab'asi\n |first=R.

This is a model architecture that divides methods into a [[Communication protocol#Layering|layered system of protocols]], originally documented in {{IETF RFC|1122}} and {{IETF RFC|1123}}.\n\n===Layers===\nThe software layers correspond to the environment or scope in which their services operate. At the top is the [[application layer]], space for the application-specific networking methods used in software applications. For example, a web browser program uses the [[client-server]] application model and a specific protocol of interaction between servers and clients, while many file-sharing systems use a [[peer-to-peer]] paradigm.\n\nBelow this top layer, the [[transport layer]] connects applications on different hosts with a logical channel through the network with appropriate data exchange methods. It provides several services including ordered, reliable delivery (TCP), and an unreliable datagram service (UDP).\n\nUnderlying these layers are the networking technologies that interconnect networks at their borders and exchange traffic across them. The [[Internet layer]] implements the [[Internet Protocol]] which enables computers to identify and locate each other by [[IP address|Internet Protocol (IP) addresses]], and route their traffic via intermediate (transit) networks.<ref>RFC 791, ''Internet Protocol, DARPA Internet Program Protocol Specification'', Information Sciences Institute, Sept. 1981</ref> The internet protocol layer code is independent of the type of network that it is physically running over.\n\nAt the bottom of the architecture is the [[link layer]], which provides logical connectivity between hosts. The link layer code is usually the only software part customized to the type of physical networking link protocol. Many link layers have been implemented and each operates over a type of network link, such as within a [[local area network]] (LAN) or [[wide area network]] (e.g. [[Wi-Fi]] or [[Ethernet]] or a [[Dial-up Internet access|dial-up connection]], [[Asynchronous transfer mode|ATM]] etc.).\n\n[[File:UDP encapsulation.svg|thumb|As user data is processed through the protocol stack, each abstraction layer adds encapsulation information at the sending host. Data is transmitted ''over the wire'' at the link level between hosts and routers. Encapsulation is removed by the receiving host. Intermediate relays update link encapsulation at each hop, and inspect the IP layer for routing purposes.]]\n\n===Internet protocol===\n[[Image:IP stack connections.svg|thumb|Conceptual data flow in a simple network topology of two hosts (''A'' and ''B'') connected by a link between their respective routers. The application on each host executes read and write operations as if the processes were directly connected to each other by some kind of data pipe. After establishment of this pipe, most details of the communication are hidden from each process, as the underlying principles of communication are implemented in the lower protocol layers. In analogy, at the transport layer the communication appears as host-to-host, without knowledge of the application data structures and the connecting routers, while at the internetworking layer, individual network boundaries are traversed at each router.]]\nThe most prominent component of the Internet model is the Internet Protocol (IP). IP enables internetworking and, in essence, establishes the Internet itself. Two versions of the Internet Protocol exist, IPV4 and IPV6.\n\n====IP Addresses====\n[[File:An example of theoretical DNS recursion.svg|right|thumb|A DNS resolver consults three name servers to resolve the domain name user-visible \"www.wikipedia.org\" to determine the IPV4 Address 207.142.131.234]]\nFor locating individual computers on the network, the Internet provides [[IP address]]es. IP addresses are used by the Internet infrastructure to direct internet packets to their destinations. They consist of fixed-length numbers, which are found within the packet. IP addresses are generally assigned to equipment either automatically via [[DHCP]], or are configured.\n\nHowever the network also supports other addressing systems. Users generally enter [[fully qualified domain name|domain name]]s (e.g. \"en.wikipedia.org\") instead of IP addresses because they are easier to remember, they are converted by the [[Domain Name System]] (DNS) into IP addresses which are more efficient for routing purposes.\n\n====IPv4====\n[[IPv4|Internet Protocol version 4]] (IPv4) defines an IP address as a [[32-bit]] number.<ref name=rfc791>{{Cite IETF|rfc=791|title=Internet Protocol, DARPA Internet Program Protocol Specification|editor=[[Jon Postel|J.

In essence, it establishes a parallel version of the Internet not directly accessible with IPv4 software. Thus, translation facilities must exist for internetworking or nodes must have duplicate networking software for both networks. Essentially all modern computer operating systems support both versions of the Internet Protocol. Network infrastructure, however, has been lagging in this development. Aside from the complex array of physical connections that make up its infrastructure, the Internet is facilitated by bi- or multi-lateral commercial contracts, e.g., [[peering agreement]]s, and by technical specifications or protocols that describe the exchange of data over the network. Indeed, the Internet is defined by its interconnections and routing policies.\n\n====Subnetwork====\n[[File:Subnetting Concept-en.svg|thumb|300px|right|Creating a subnet by dividing the host identifier]]\nA ''[[subnetwork]]'' or ''subnet'' is a logical subdivision of an [[IP network]].<ref name=\"rfc950\">{{Cite IETF\n    | rfc         = 950\n    | publisher   = [[IETF]]\n    | author1     = Jeffrey Mogul\n    | author2     = Jon Postel\n    | authorlink2 = Jon Postel\n    | title       = Internet Standard Subnetting Procedure\n    | date        = August 1985\n  }} Updated by RFC 6918.</ref>{{rp|1,16}} The practice of dividing a network into two or more networks is called ''subnetting''.\n\nComputers that belong to a subnet are addressed with an identical [[most-significant bit]]-group in their [[IP address]]es. This results in the logical division of an IP address into two fields, the ''network number'' or ''routing prefix'' and the ''rest field'' or ''host identifier''. The ''rest field'' is an identifier for a specific [[Host (network)|host]] or network interface.\n\nThe ''routing prefix'' may be expressed in [[Classless Inter-Domain Routing]] (CIDR) notation written as the first address of a network, followed by a slash character (''/''), and ending with the bit-length of the prefix. For example, {{IPaddr|198.51.100.0|24}} is the prefix of the [[Internet Protocol version 4]] network starting at the given address, having 24 bits allocated for the network prefix, and the remaining 8 bits reserved for host addressing. Addresses in the range {{IPaddr|198.51.100.0}} to {{IPaddr|198.51.100.255}} belong to this network. The [[IPv6]] address specification {{IPaddr|2001:db8::|32}} is a large address block with 2<sup>96</sup> addresses, having a 32-bit routing prefix.\n\nFor IPv4, a network may also be characterized by its ''subnet mask'' or ''netmask'', which is the [[bitmask]] that when applied by a [[bitwise AND]] operation to any IP address in the network, yields the routing prefix. Subnet masks are also expressed in [[dot-decimal notation]] like an address. For example, {{IPaddr|255.255.255.0}} is the subnet mask for the prefix {{IPaddr|198.51.100.0|24}}.\n\nTraffic is exchanged between subnetworks through [[router (computing)|routers]] when the routing prefixes of the source address and the destination address differ. A router serves as a logical or physical boundary between the subnets.\n\nThe benefits of subnetting an existing network vary with each deployment scenario. In the address allocation architecture of the Internet using CIDR and in large organizations, it is necessary to allocate address space efficiently. Subnetting may also enhance routing efficiency, or have advantages in network management when subnetworks are administratively controlled by different entities in a larger organization.  Subnets may be arranged logically in a hierarchical architecture, partitioning an organization's network address space into a tree-like routing structure.\n\n===IETF===\nWhile the hardware components in the Internet infrastructure can often be used to support other software systems, it is the design and the standardization process of the software that characterizes the Internet and provides the foundation for its scalability and success. The responsibility for the architectural design of the Internet software systems has been assumed by the [[Internet Engineering Task Force]] (IETF).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ietf.org/ |title=IETF Home Page |publisher=Ietf.org |accessdate=20 June 2009 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090618032558/http://www.ietf.org/ |archivedate=18 June 2009 |df= }}</ref> The IETF conducts standard-setting work groups, open to any individual, about the various aspects of Internet architecture.

Compared to printed media, books, encyclopedias and traditional libraries, the World Wide Web has enabled the decentralization of information on a large scale.\n\nThe Web has enabled individuals and organizations to [[publish]] ideas and information to a potentially large [[audience]] online at greatly reduced expense and time delay. Publishing a web page, a blog, or building a website involves little initial [[cost]] and many cost-free services are available. However, publishing and maintaining large, professional web sites with attractive, diverse and up-to-date information is still a difficult and expensive proposition. Many individuals and some companies and groups use ''web logs'' or blogs, which are largely used as easily updatable online diaries.

Websites are often created using [[content management]] software with, initially, very little content. Contributors to these systems, who may be paid staff, members of an organization or the public, fill underlying databases with content using editing pages designed for that purpose while casual visitors view and read this content in HTML form.

Emails can be [[Carbon copy|cc-ed]] to multiple [[email address]]es.\n\n[[Internet telephony]] is another common communications service made possible by the creation of the Internet. [[VoIP]] stands for Voice-over-[[Internet Protocol]], referring to the protocol that underlies all Internet communication. The idea began in the early 1990s with [[walkie-talkie]]-like voice applications for personal computers. In recent years many VoIP systems have become as easy to use and as convenient as a normal telephone. The benefit is that, as the Internet carries the voice traffic, VoIP can be free or cost much less than a traditional telephone call, especially over long distances and especially for those with always-on Internet connections such as [[Cable modem|cable]] or [[ADSL]] and [[mobile data]].<ref name=EBSCOhost>{{cite journal|last=Booth|first=C|title=Chapter 2: IP Phones, Software VoIP, and Integrated and Mobile VoIP|journal=Library Technology Reports|year=2010|volume=46|issue=5|pages=11\u201319}}</ref> VoIP is maturing into a competitive alternative to traditional telephone service. Interoperability between different providers has improved and the ability to call or receive a call from a traditional telephone is available. Simple, inexpensive VoIP network adapters are available that eliminate the need for a personal computer.\n\nVoice quality can still vary from call to call, but is often equal to and can even exceed that of traditional calls. Remaining problems for VoIP include [[emergency telephone number]] dialing and reliability. Currently,{{When|date=March 2020}} a few VoIP providers provide an emergency service, but it is not universally available. Older traditional phones with no \"extra features\" may be line-powered only and operate during a power failure; VoIP can never do so without a [[uninterruptible power supply|backup power source]] for the phone equipment and the Internet access devices. VoIP has also become increasingly popular for gaming applications, as a form of communication between players. Popular VoIP clients for gaming include [[Ventrilo]] and [[Teamspeak]]. Modern video game consoles also offer VoIP chat features.\n\n=== Data transfer ===\n[[File sharing]] is an example of transferring large amounts of data across the Internet. A [[computer file]] can be emailed to customers, colleagues and friends as an attachment. It can be uploaded to a website or [[File Transfer Protocol]] (FTP) server for easy download by others. It can be put into a \"shared location\" or onto a [[file server]] for instant use by colleagues. The load of bulk downloads to many users can be eased by the use of \"[[Web mirror|mirror]]\" servers or [[peer-to-peer]] networks. In any of these cases, access to the file may be controlled by user [[authentication]], the transit of the file over the Internet may be obscured by [[encryption]], and money may change hands for access to the file. The price can be paid by the remote charging of funds from, for example, a credit card whose details are also passed \u2013 usually fully encrypted \u2013 across the Internet. The origin and authenticity of the file received may be checked by [[digital signature]]s or by [[MD5]] or other message digests. These simple features of the Internet, over a worldwide basis, are changing the production, sale, and distribution of anything that can be reduced to a computer file for transmission. This includes all manner of print publications, software products, news, music, film, video, photography, graphics and the other arts. This in turn has caused seismic shifts in each of the existing industries that previously controlled the production and distribution of these products.\n\n[[Streaming media]] is the real-time delivery of digital media for the immediate consumption or enjoyment by end users. Many radio and television broadcasters provide Internet feeds of their live audio and video productions. They may also allow time-shift viewing or listening such as Preview, Classic Clips and Listen Again features. These providers have been joined by a range of pure Internet \"broadcasters\" who never had on-air licenses. This means that an Internet-connected device, such as a computer or something more specific, can be used to access on-line media in much the same way as was previously possible only with a television or radio receiver. The range of available types of content is much wider, from specialized technical [[webcast]]s to on-demand popular multimedia services. [[Podcast]]ing is a variation on this theme, where \u2013 usually audio \u2013 material is downloaded and played back on a computer or shifted to a [[portable media player]] to be listened to on the move. These techniques using simple equipment allow anybody, with little censorship or licensing control, to broadcast audio-visual material worldwide.\n\nDigital media streaming increases the demand for network bandwidth.  For example, standard image quality needs 1 Mbit/s link speed for SD 480p, HD 720p quality requires 2.5 Mbit/s, and the top-of-the-line HDX quality needs 4.5 Mbit/s for 1080p.<ref>{{cite web |last=Morrison |first=Geoff |url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/40241749 |title=What to know before buying a 'connected' TV \u2013 Technology & science \u2013 Tech and gadgets \u2013 Tech Holiday Guide |publisher=NBC News |date=18 November 2010 |accessdate=8 August 2011 |df= |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200212091603/http://www.nbcnews.com/id/40241749 |archive-date=12 February 2020 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n[[Webcam]]s are a low-cost extension of this phenomenon. While some webcams can give full-frame-rate video, the picture either is usually small or updates slowly. Internet users can watch animals around an African waterhole, ships in the [[Panama Canal]], traffic at a local roundabout or monitor their own premises, live and in real time. Video [[chat rooms]] and [[video conferencing]] are also popular with many uses being found for personal webcams, with and without two-way sound. YouTube was founded on 15 February 2005 and is now the leading website for free streaming video with a vast number of users. It uses a HTML5 based web player by default to stream and show video files.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://youtube-eng.googleblog.com/2015/01/youtube-now-defaults-to-html5_27.html|title=YouTube now defaults to HTML5 <video>|work=YouTube Engineering and Developers Blog|access-date=2018-09-10|language=en-US|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180910204225/https://youtube-eng.googleblog.com/2015/01/youtube-now-defaults-to-html5_27.html|archive-date=10 September 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> Registered users may upload an unlimited amount of video and build their own personal profile.

The Internet can be accessed almost anywhere by numerous means, including through [[mobile Internet device]]s. Mobile phones, [[datacard]]s, [[handheld game console]]s and [[cellular router]]s allow users to connect to the Internet [[wireless]]ly. Within the limitations imposed by small screens and other limited facilities of such pocket-sized devices, the services of the Internet, including email and the web, may be available. Service providers may restrict the services offered and mobile data charges may be significantly higher than other access methods.\n\nEducational material at all levels from pre-school to post-doctoral is available from websites. Examples range from [[CBeebies]], through school and high-school revision guides and [[Virtual university|virtual universities]], to access to top-end scholarly literature through the likes of [[Google Scholar]].

The Internet in general and the [[World Wide Web]] in particular are important enablers of both [[Education|formal]] and [[informal education]]. Further, the Internet allows universities, in particular, researchers from the social and behavioral sciences, to conduct research remotely via virtual laboratories, with profound changes in reach and generalizability of findings as well as in communication between scientists and in the publication of results.<ref>Reips, U.-D.

Not only can a group cheaply communicate and share ideas but the wide reach of the Internet allows such groups more easily to form. An example of this is the [[free software movement]], which has produced, among other things, [[Linux]], [[Mozilla Firefox]], and [[OpenOffice.org]] (later forked into [[LibreOffice]]). Internet chat, whether using an [[IRC]] chat room, an [[instant messaging]] system, or a [[social networking]] website, allows colleagues to stay in touch in a very convenient way while working at their computers during the day.  Messages can be exchanged even more quickly and conveniently than via email. These systems may allow files to be exchanged, drawings and images to be shared, or voice and video contact between team members.\n\n[[Content management]] systems allow collaborating teams to work on shared sets of documents simultaneously without accidentally destroying each other's work. Business and project teams can share calendars as well as documents and other information. Such collaboration occurs in a wide variety of areas including scientific research, software development, conference planning, political activism and creative writing. Social and political collaboration is also becoming more widespread as both Internet access and [[computer literacy]] spread.\n\nThe Internet allows computer users to remotely access other computers and information stores easily from any access point. Access may be with [[computer security]], i.e. authentication and encryption technologies, depending on the requirements. This is encouraging new ways of working from home, collaboration and information sharing in many industries. An accountant sitting at home can [[audit]] the books of a company based in another country, on a [[server (computing)|server]] situated in a third country that is remotely maintained by IT specialists in a fourth. These accounts could have been created by home-working bookkeepers, in other remote locations, based on information emailed to them from offices all over the world. Some of these things were possible before the widespread use of the Internet, but the cost of private [[leased line]]s would have made many of them infeasible in practice. An office worker away from their desk, perhaps on the other side of the world on a business trip or a holiday, can access their emails, access their data using [[cloud computing]], or open a [[Remote Desktop Protocol|remote desktop]] session into their office PC using a secure [[virtual private network]] (VPN) connection on the Internet. This can give the worker complete access to all of their normal files and data, including email and other applications, while away from the office. It has been referred to among [[system administrator]]s as the Virtual Private Nightmare,<ref>{{cite web|title=The Virtual Private Nightmare: VPN |url=http://librenix.com/?inode=5013 |publisher=Librenix |accessdate=21 July 2010 |date=4 August 2004 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110515152637/http://librenix.com/?inode=5013 |archivedate=15 May 2011 |df= }}</ref> because it extends the secure perimeter of a corporate network into remote locations and its employees' homes.\n\n=== Social networking and entertainment ===\n{{See also|Social networking service#Social impact}}\nMany people use the World Wide Web to access news, weather and sports reports, to plan and book vacations and to pursue their personal interests. People use [[online chat|chat]], messaging and email to make and stay in touch with friends worldwide, sometimes in the same way as some previously had [[pen pal]]s. [[Social network service|Social networking]] websites such as [[Facebook]], [[Twitter]], and [[Myspace]] have created new ways to socialize and interact. Users of these sites are able to add a wide variety of information to pages, to pursue common interests, and to connect with others. It is also possible to find existing acquaintances, to allow communication among existing groups of people. Sites like [[LinkedIn]] foster commercial and business connections. YouTube and [[Flickr]] specialize in users' videos and photographs. While social networking sites were initially for individuals only, today they are widely used by businesses and other organizations to promote their brands, to market to their customers and to encourage posts to \"[[Viral marketing|go viral]]\". \"Black hat\" social media techniques are also employed by some organizations, such as [[Spamming|spam]] accounts and [[astroturfing]].\n\nA risk for both individuals and organizations writing posts (especially public posts) on social networking websites, is that especially foolish or controversial posts occasionally lead to an unexpected and possibly large-scale backlash on social media from other Internet users. This is also a risk in relation to controversial ''offline'' behavior, if it is widely made known. The nature of this backlash can range widely from counter-arguments and public mockery, through insults and [[hate speech]], to, in extreme cases, rape and death [[Computer crime#Threats|threats]]. The [[online disinhibition effect]] describes the tendency of many individuals to behave more stridently or offensively online than they would in person. A significant number of [[feminist]] women have been the target of various forms of [[harassment]] in response to posts they have made on social media, and Twitter in particular has been criticised in the past for not doing enough to aid victims of online abuse.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-23477130 |title=Twitter 'report abuse' button calls after rape threats |last=Moore |first=Keith |date=27 July 2013 |work=[[BBC News]] |accessdate=7 December 2014 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140904014545/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-23477130 |archivedate=4 September 2014 |df= }}</ref>\n\nFor organizations, such a backlash can cause overall [[public relations|brand damage]], especially if reported by the media. However, this is not always the case, as any brand damage in the eyes of people with an opposing opinion to that presented by the organization could sometimes be outweighed by strengthening the brand in the eyes of others. Furthermore, if an organization or individual gives in to demands that others perceive as wrong-headed, that can then provoke a counter-backlash.\n\nSome websites, such as [[Reddit]], have rules forbidding the posting of [[personal information]] of individuals (also known as [[doxxing]]), due to concerns about such postings leading to mobs of large numbers of Internet users directing harassment at the specific individuals thereby identified. In particular, the Reddit rule forbidding the posting of personal information is widely understood to imply that all identifying photos and names must be [[censored]] in Facebook [[screenshots]] posted to Reddit. However, the interpretation of this rule in relation to public Twitter posts is less clear, and in any case, like-minded people online have many other ways they can use to direct each other's attention to public social media posts they disagree with.\n\nChildren also face dangers online such as [[cyberbullying]] and [[Child grooming|approaches by sexual predators]], who sometimes pose as children themselves. Children may also encounter material which they may find upsetting, or material which their parents consider to be not age-appropriate. Due to naivety, they may also post personal information about themselves online, which could put them or their families at risk unless warned not to do so. Many parents choose to enable [[Content-control software|Internet filtering]], and/or supervise their children's online activities, in an attempt to protect their children from inappropriate material on the Internet. The most popular social networking websites, such as Facebook and Twitter, commonly forbid users under the age of 13. However, these policies are typically trivial to circumvent by registering an account with a false birth date, and a significant number of children aged under 13 join such sites anyway. Social networking sites for younger children, which claim to provide better levels of protection for children, also exist.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mashable.com/2010/10/11/social-networks-children/ |title=5 Fun and Safe Social Networks for Children |date=11 October 2010 |accessdate=7 December 2014 |website=[[Mashable]] |last=Kessler |first=Sarah |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141220082237/http://mashable.com/2010/10/11/social-networks-children/ |archivedate=20 December 2014 |df= }}</ref>\n\nThe Internet has been a major outlet for leisure activity since its inception, with entertaining [[social experiment]]s such as [[MUD]]s and [[MOO]]s being conducted on university servers, and humor-related [[Usenet]] groups receiving much traffic.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}} Many [[Internet forums]] have sections devoted to games and funny videos.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}} The [[Internet pornography]] and [[online gambling]] industries have taken advantage of the World Wide Web.

Computers communicate over the Internet by breaking up messages (emails, images, videos, web pages, files, etc.) into small chunks called \"packets\", which are routed through a network of computers, until they reach their destination, where they are assembled back into a complete \"message\" again. [[Packet Capture Appliance]] intercepts these packets as they are traveling through the network, in order to examine their contents using other programs. A packet capture is an information ''gathering'' tool, but not an ''analysis'' tool. That is it gathers \"messages\" but it does not analyze them and figure out what they mean. Other programs are needed to perform [[traffic analysis]] and sift through intercepted data looking for important/useful information. Under the [[Communications Assistance For Law Enforcement Act]] all U.S. telecommunications providers are required to install packet sniffing technology to allow Federal law enforcement and intelligence agencies to intercept all of their customers' [[broadband Internet]] and [[voice over Internet protocol]] (VoIP) traffic.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.baller.com/pdfs/ACE.pdf|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120907032500/http://www.baller.com/pdfs/ACE.pdf|title=American Council on Education vs. FCC, Decision, United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit|date=9 June 2006|accessdate=8 September 2013|archivedate=7 September 2012}}</ref>\n\nThe large amount of data gathered from packet capturing requires surveillance software that filters and reports relevant information, such as the use of certain words or phrases, the access of certain types of web sites, or communicating via email or chat with certain parties.<ref name=\"usatoday-chatroom\">{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/tech/news/surveillance/2004-10-11-chatroom-surv_x.htm|title=Government funds chat room surveillance research|last=Hill|first=Michael|date=11 October 2004|agency=Associated Press|newspaper=USA Today|accessdate=2009-03-19|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100511220550/http://www.usatoday.com/tech/news/surveillance/2004-10-11-chatroom-surv_x.htm|archivedate=11 May 2010|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Agencies, such as the [[Information Awareness Office]], [[NSA]], [[GCHQ]] and the [[FBI]], spend billions of dollars per year to develop, purchase, implement, and operate systems for interception and analysis of data.<ref name=\"zdnet-fbi\">{{cite news|url=http://news.zdnet.com/2100-9595_22-151059.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100407040227/http://news.zdnet.com/2100-9595_22-151059.html|title=FBI turns to broad new wiretap method|last=McCullagh|first=Declan|date=30 January 2007|work=ZDNet News|accessdate=2009-03-13|archivedate=7 April 2010}}</ref> Similar systems are operated by [[Ministry of Intelligence and National Security of Iran|Iranian secret police]] to identify and suppress dissidents.

He challenged twice for the [[World Boxing Council|WBC]] [[welterweight]] title; first in 1977 against [[Carlos Palomino]] and again in 1980 against [[Sugar Ray Leonard]]. At regional level, he held the [[British Boxing Board of Control|British]] and [[European Boxing Union|European]] [[super-lightweight]] titles in 1976, becoming the first British fighter to hold the latter,<ref name=\"Lloyd pp. 30-31\">[[#Lloyd|Lloyd]], pp. 30\u201331.</ref> and the European welterweight title in 1979.\n\n==Early life==\nGreen was born on 2 June 1953, in [[Chatteris]], [[Cambridgeshire]], a small [[The Fens|fenland]] town. His father was a farmer and so Green's first experience of work was helping out around the family farm.<ref name=\"Lloyd p. 25\">[[#Lloyd|Lloyd]], p. 25.</ref> He attended Cromwell School where he was keen on [[Association football|football]] and [[cross country running]], but took up boxing in 1967 after joining the Chatteris Amateur Boxing Club. He was trained by Arthur Binder who had taught [[Eric Boon]], a famous local boxer. Green had 105 amateur contests, winning 84 with 33 inside the distance.<ref name=\"Lloyd p. 27\">[[#Lloyd|Lloyd]], p. 27.</ref>\n\n==Professional career==\nIn 1974, Green turned professional under the guidance of manager Andy Smith. He made his professional debut on 10 December 1974, when he beat Yotham Kunda by knockout in the second round. Green went on to achieve 15 straight wins, earning a shot at the British light-welterweight title.<ref name=\"Dave \u201cBoy\u201d Green: The Lad Who Loved a Dust Up\">{{cite web|url=http://ringsidereport.com/?p=58214|title=Dave \"Boy\" Green: The Lad Who Loved a Dust Up|publisher=Ringside Report|date=13 February 2016|accessdate=17 November 2018}}</ref>\n\n===British light-welterweight champion===\nOn 1 June 1976, Green entered the ring in a tiger-skin dressing-gown to win the [[List of British light-welterweight boxing champions|British light-welterweight title]] against [[Joey Singleton]] with powerful hooks to the head and body.<ref>''Fen Tiger The Success of Dave \"Boy\" Green'' Lonkhurst, B: Potters Bar, BL Associates, 2004 {{ISBN|0-9540271-2-4}}</ref> Though receiving stinging jabs all the while, Singleton was the better boxer, but Green's power began to show. The crowd wanted Green to deliver his \"muck spreader\" punch, but his boxing lead to a retirement in the sixth round.\n\n===European light-welterweight champion===\nOn 7 December 1976 Green took on the Pride of Paris, Jean-Baptiste Piedvache, for the vacant [[List of European Boxing Union light welterweight champions|European light-welterweight title]]. Green was staggered in the eighth round but Piedvache's left eye was beginning to close. With a strong right and left hooks, Green retired Piedvache in the ninth round while ahead on points. It was Green's 22nd straight win with 18 inside the distance.<ref name=\"Dave \u201cBoy\u201d Green: The Lad Who Loved a Dust Up\"/>\n\nOn 29 March 1977, Green fought [[John H. Stracey]] at Wembley as a final eliminator to challenge for the [[World Boxing Council|WBC]] welterweight title. Stracey was a former [[List of WBC world champions#Welterweight|WBC welterweight champion]] from the tough [[East End of London]]. The odds appeared to be even going into the bout, but Green went on to win the match due to Stracey's left eye starting to close.<ref name=\"Lloyd p. 30\">[[#Lloyd|Lloyd]], p. 30.</ref>\n\n===Challenger for world title===\n====Green vs. Palomino====\nOn 14 June 1977, Green challenged Carlos Palomino for the WBC welterweight title at [[Wembley Arena|Empire Pool]]. Fortunes swayed with Green digging deep, his left eye closing, but Palomino boxed superbly to win by a left-hook knockout in the 11th round. It was the first time Green had been floored as a professional. After his loss, Green's next bout was against fellow British boxer Andy Price, beating him on points.<ref>{{cite news |title=Green vows: Price will pay|work=Sports Argus |date= 24 September 1977 |accessdate=18 November 2018 |url=https://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/bl/0002192/19770924/047/0006| via = [[British Newspaper Archive]]|url-access=subscription }}</ref>\n\n====European welterweight champion====\nOn 29 January 1979, Green challenged [[Henry Rhiney]] for the [[List of European Boxing Union welterweight champions|European welterweight title]]. It was an all-British fight with all the tickets sold. The bout started at a terrific pace both men going toe-to-toe. A solid right to the head of Rhiney led Mr. Nathan to stop the fight, making Green a dual European Champion, and the first Englishman to do so since [[Ted \"Kid\" Lewis|Ted Lewis]] in 1920.<ref name=\"Lloyd p. 32\">[[#Lloyd|Lloyd]], p. 32.</ref>\n\nOn 28 June 1979, Green defended his European welterweight title against Dane [[J\u00f8rgen Hansen (boxer)|J\u00f8rgen Hansen]]. Green knocked Hansen down in the second round, but the Dane fought on, knocking Green down twice in the third, and forcing the referee to stop the bout. Being a true sportsman Green applauded Hansen when the belt was presented.<ref name=\"Lloyd p. 32\">[[#Lloyd|Lloyd]], p. 32.</ref>\n\n====Green vs. Leonard====\nThe final challenge for the WBC welterweight title happened on 31 March 1980 against the holder [[Sugar Ray Leonard]] at the Capital Centre [[Landover, Maryland]] US. Green suffered a devastating knockout in the fourth round being out cold before he hit the canvas. Referee Arthur Mercante, ruled that it was too dangerous to continue the count and stopped at six.<ref>{{cite web|url= https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=XZwcAAAAIBAJ&sjid=xWcEAAAAIBAJ&pg=2693,594525&dq=sugar+ray+leonard+dave+green&hl=en |title= Leonard Knocks Out Lalonde to Win Two Titles| work= Sarasota Herald Tribune, April 2, 1980 |via= news.google.com |first= Phil| last= Berger| date= November 8, 1988 |accessdate=2018-04-02}}</ref> ''[[The Times]]'' reported \"Leaning forward, dipping to left and right so that either hand could hit with equal venom, Leonard struck Green with a left and followed up quickly with a right-left-right, that started a clangour in Green's head, and the Briton crashed onto his back at the same place in the ring where Carlos Palomino had sent him toppling backwards\".<ref>The Times, Tuesday, Apr 01, 1980; p. 27; Issue 60590; col C</ref>\n\n===Later career===\nAfter his loss to Leonard, Green returned to the ring on 14 November 1980, against American Mario Mendez, stopping him in the second round. Green's final bout, on 3 November 1981, was at the [[Royal Albert Hall]] against Reg Ford a New York-based Guyanan who was a one time sparring partner to [[Thomas Hearns]]. Andy Smith retired Green in the fifth round with cuts and a closing left eye.\n\n==After boxing==\nGreen appeared in the BBC Series ''[[Superstars]]'' where he competed in the multi discipline event against other sports stars.\n\nCurrently Green is Chairman of Renoak Limited in Chatteris, a company he founded with Bob Emerson. Dave takes part in charity golf events. His success can be summed up by Sugar Ray Leonard, \"Dave was a brave fighting man who never gave less than one hundred per cent whenever he put the gloves on. He is a warm human being who does tremendous work for charity, and I'm thrilled he has made such a success in business\".\n\nGreen married Kay Curson on 26 October 1974. They have a son and twin daughters.<ref name=\"Lloyd p. 29\">[[#Lloyd|Lloyd]], p. 29.</ref> In 2012, Green was awarded an MBE for services to Boxing and Charity in the Cambridgeshire area.<ref name=\"Dave 'Boy' Green: Honoured\">{{cite web|url=http://www.boxingnewsonline.net/dave-boy-green-honoured/|title=Dave 'Boy' Green: Honoured|publisher=Boxing News Online|date=14 August 2016|accessdate=17 November 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Professional boxing record==\n{{BoxingRecordSummary\n|draws=0\n|ko-wins=29\n|ko-losses=4\n|dec-wins=8\n|dec-losses=0\n}}\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;

better known as '''Dave Boy Green''', is a former British [[professional boxer]] who competed from 1974 to 1981. He challenged twice for the [[World Boxing Council|WBC]] [[welterweight]] title; first in 1977 against [[Carlos Palomino]] and again in 1980 against [[Sugar Ray Leonard]]. At regional level, he held the [[British Boxing Board of Control|British]] and [[European Boxing Union|European]] [[super-lightweight]] titles in 1976, becoming the first British fighter to hold the latter,<ref name=\"Lloyd pp. 30-31\">[[#Lloyd|Lloyd]], pp. 30\u201331.</ref> and the European welterweight title in 1979.\n\n==Early life==\nGreen was born on 2 June 1953, in [[Chatteris]], [[Cambridgeshire]], a small [[The Fens|fenland]] town. His father was a farmer and so Green's first experience of work was helping out around the family farm.<ref name=\"Lloyd p. 25\">[[#Lloyd|Lloyd]], p. 25.</ref> He attended Cromwell School where he was keen on [[Association football|football]] and [[cross country running]], but took up boxing in 1967 after joining the Chatteris Amateur Boxing Club. He was trained by Arthur Binder who had taught [[Eric Boon]], a famous local boxer. Green had 105 amateur contests, winning 84 with 33 inside the distance.<ref name=\"Lloyd p. 27\">[[#Lloyd|Lloyd]], p. 27.</ref>\n\n==Professional career==\nIn 1974, Green turned professional under the guidance of manager Andy Smith. He made his professional debut on 10 December 1974, when he beat Yotham Kunda by knockout in the second round. Green went on to achieve 15 straight wins, earning a shot at the British light-welterweight title.<ref name=\"Dave \u201cBoy\u201d Green: The Lad Who Loved a Dust Up\">{{cite web|url=http://ringsidereport.com/?p=58214|title=Dave \"Boy\" Green: The Lad Who Loved a Dust Up|publisher=Ringside Report|date=13 February 2016|accessdate=17 November 2018}}</ref>\n\n===British light-welterweight champion===\nOn 1 June 1976, Green entered the ring in a tiger-skin dressing-gown to win the [[List of British light-welterweight boxing champions|British light-welterweight title]] against [[Joey Singleton]] with powerful hooks to the head and body.<ref>''Fen Tiger The Success of Dave \"Boy\" Green'' Lonkhurst, B: Potters Bar, BL Associates, 2004 {{ISBN|0-9540271-2-4}}</ref> Though receiving stinging jabs all the while, Singleton was the better boxer, but Green's power began to show. The crowd wanted Green to deliver his \"muck spreader\" punch, but his boxing lead to a retirement in the sixth round.\n\n===European light-welterweight champion===\nOn 7 December 1976 Green took on the Pride of Paris, Jean-Baptiste Piedvache, for the vacant [[List of European Boxing Union light welterweight champions|European light-welterweight title]]. Green was staggered in the eighth round but Piedvache's left eye was beginning to close. With a strong right and left hooks, Green retired Piedvache in the ninth round while ahead on points. It was Green's 22nd straight win with 18 inside the distance.<ref name=\"Dave \u201cBoy\u201d Green: The Lad Who Loved a Dust Up\"/>\n\nOn 29 March 1977, Green fought [[John H. Stracey]] at Wembley as a final eliminator to challenge for the [[World Boxing Council|WBC]] welterweight title. Stracey was a former [[List of WBC world champions#Welterweight|WBC welterweight champion]] from the tough [[East End of London]]. The odds appeared to be even going into the bout, but Green went on to win the match due to Stracey's left eye starting to close.<ref name=\"Lloyd p. 30\">[[#Lloyd|Lloyd]], p. 30.</ref>\n\n===Challenger for world title===\n====Green vs. Palomino====\nOn 14 June 1977, Green challenged Carlos Palomino for the WBC welterweight title at [[Wembley Arena|Empire Pool]]. Fortunes swayed with Green digging deep, his left eye closing, but Palomino boxed superbly to win by a left-hook knockout in the 11th round. It was the first time Green had been floored as a professional. After his loss, Green's next bout was against fellow British boxer Andy Price, beating him on points.<ref>{{cite news |title=Green vows: Price will pay|work=Sports Argus |date= 24 September 1977 |accessdate=18 November 2018 |url=https://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/bl/0002192/19770924/047/0006| via = [[British Newspaper Archive]]|url-access=subscription }}</ref>\n\n====European welterweight champion====\nOn 29 January 1979, Green challenged [[Henry Rhiney]] for the [[List of European Boxing Union welterweight champions|European welterweight title]]. It was an all-British fight with all the tickets sold. The bout started at a terrific pace both men going toe-to-toe. A solid right to the head of Rhiney led Mr. Nathan to stop the fight, making Green a dual European Champion, and the first Englishman to do so since [[Ted \"Kid\" Lewis|Ted Lewis]] in 1920.<ref name=\"Lloyd p. 32\">[[#Lloyd|Lloyd]], p. 32.</ref>\n\nOn 28 June 1979, Green defended his European welterweight title against Dane [[J\u00f8rgen Hansen (boxer)|J\u00f8rgen Hansen]]. Green knocked Hansen down in the second round, but the Dane fought on, knocking Green down twice in the third, and forcing the referee to stop the bout. Being a true sportsman Green applauded Hansen when the belt was presented.<ref name=\"Lloyd p. 32\">[[#Lloyd|Lloyd]], p. 32.</ref>\n\n====Green vs. Leonard====\nThe final challenge for the WBC welterweight title happened on 31 March 1980 against the holder [[Sugar Ray Leonard]] at the Capital Centre [[Landover, Maryland]] US. Green suffered a devastating knockout in the fourth round being out cold before he hit the canvas. Referee Arthur Mercante, ruled that it was too dangerous to continue the count and stopped at six.<ref>{{cite web|url= https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=XZwcAAAAIBAJ&sjid=xWcEAAAAIBAJ&pg=2693,594525&dq=sugar+ray+leonard+dave+green&hl=en |title= Leonard Knocks Out Lalonde to Win Two Titles| work= Sarasota Herald Tribune, April 2, 1980 |via= news.google.com |first= Phil| last= Berger| date= November 8, 1988 |accessdate=2018-04-02}}</ref> ''[[The Times]]'' reported \"Leaning forward, dipping to left and right so that either hand could hit with equal venom, Leonard struck Green with a left and followed up quickly with a right-left-right, that started a clangour in Green's head, and the Briton crashed onto his back at the same place in the ring where Carlos Palomino had sent him toppling backwards\".<ref>The Times, Tuesday, Apr 01, 1980; p. 27; Issue 60590; col C</ref>\n\n===Later career===\nAfter his loss to Leonard, Green returned to the ring on 14 November 1980, against American Mario Mendez, stopping him in the second round. Green's final bout, on 3 November 1981, was at the [[Royal Albert Hall]] against Reg Ford a New York-based Guyanan who was a one time sparring partner to [[Thomas Hearns]]. Andy Smith retired Green in the fifth round with cuts and a closing left eye.\n\n==After boxing==\nGreen appeared in the BBC Series ''[[Superstars]]'' where he competed in the multi discipline event against other sports stars.\n\nCurrently Green is Chairman of Renoak Limited in Chatteris, a company he founded with Bob Emerson. Dave takes part in charity golf events. His success can be summed up by Sugar Ray Leonard, \"Dave was a brave fighting man who never gave less than one hundred per cent whenever he put the gloves on. He is a warm human being who does tremendous work for charity, and I'm thrilled he has made such a success in business\".\n\nGreen married Kay Curson on 26 October 1974. They have a son and twin daughters.<ref name=\"Lloyd p. 29\">[[#Lloyd|Lloyd]], p. 29.</ref> In 2012, Green was awarded an MBE for services to Boxing and Charity in the Cambridgeshire area.<ref name=\"Dave 'Boy' Green: Honoured\">{{cite web|url=http://www.boxingnewsonline.net/dave-boy-green-honoured/|title=Dave 'Boy' Green: Honoured|publisher=Boxing News Online|date=14 August 2016|accessdate=17 November 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Professional boxing record==\n{{BoxingRecordSummary\n|draws=0\n|ko-wins=29\n|ko-losses=4\n|dec-wins=8\n|dec-losses=0\n}}\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;

The tournament concluded with the [[Eastern Conference (NBA)|Eastern Conference]] champion [[1985\u201386 Boston Celtics season|Boston Celtics]] defeating the [[Western Conference (NBA)|Western Conference]] champion [[1985\u201386 Houston Rockets season|Houston Rockets]] 4 games to 2 in the [[1986 NBA Finals|NBA Finals]]. [[Larry Bird]] was named [[Bill Russell NBA Finals Most Valuable Player Award|NBA Finals MVP]] for the second time.\n\nThis was the second NBA Finals meeting between the Celtics and Rockets; they met in the [[1981 NBA Finals]] with the same result. It was the third of four straight Eastern Conference championships for Boston, who won 67 games that year, and went 40\u20131 at home. The Rockets, meanwhile had won just their second conference title in franchise history.\n\nSecond-year player [[Michael Jordan]] put on a record-setting performance in Game 2 of the [[1985\u201386 Chicago Bulls season|Bulls']] first-round series against the Celtics, scoring 63 points in a 2-OT loss, which surpassed [[Elgin Baylor]]'s 61-point performance from the [[1962 NBA Finals]] and still stands as the [[List of National Basketball Association players with 50 or more points in a playoff game|NBA Playoff scoring record]]. Jordan averaged 44.7 points per game in the series, but was unable to prevent the Bulls from being swept by a more experienced, more talented Celtics team. The Bulls set a dubious mark by posting the second worst record for a playoff-qualifying team in history, going just 30\u201352 during the season. Game 2, where the record was set, was ranked by ''[[TV Guide]]'' as the 26th Most Memorable Moment in Television History,{{citation needed|date=June 2014}} and is credited with boosting the NBA's popularity surge and eventual rise to near the top of the United States television sports market,{{citation needed|date=June 2014}} trailing only [[American football|football]] by the mid-90s.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}\n\nThe 1986 playoffs marked the third time in four years that the [[1985\u201386 Milwaukee Bucks season|Milwaukee Bucks]] advanced to the Eastern Conference Finals, but it would be their last appearance in the series until [[2001 NBA playoffs|2001]]. The Celtics avenged their [[1983 NBA playoffs|1983]] sweep by sweeping the Bucks in four games.\n\nAs for the [[1985\u201386 Philadelphia 76ers season|Philadelphia 76ers]], this was the last time they would play in a Game 7 until 2001. After their first round loss to the [[1985\u201386 Atlanta Hawks season|Atlanta Hawks]], the [[1985\u201386 Detroit Pistons season|Detroit Pistons]] would advance past the first round in each of the next five seasons ([[1987 NBA playoffs|1987]], [[1988 NBA playoffs|1988]], [[1989 NBA playoffs|1989]], [[1990 NBA playoffs|1990]], [[1991 NBA playoffs|1991]]), which include all appearances in the

The tournament concluded with the [[Eastern Conference (NBA)|Eastern Conference]] champion [[1985\u201386 Boston Celtics season|Boston Celtics]] defeating the [[Western Conference (NBA)|Western Conference]] champion [[1985\u201386 Houston Rockets season|Houston Rockets]] 4 games to 2 in the [[1986 NBA Finals|NBA Finals]]. [[Larry Bird]] was named [[Bill Russell NBA Finals Most Valuable Player Award|NBA Finals MVP]] for the second time.\n\nThis was the second NBA Finals meeting between the Celtics and Rockets; they met in the [[1981 NBA Finals]] with the same result. It was the third of four straight Eastern Conference championships for Boston, who won 67 games that year, and went 40\u20131 at home. The Rockets, meanwhile had won just their second conference title in franchise history.\n\nSecond-year player [[Michael Jordan]] put on a record-setting performance in Game 2 of the [[1985\u201386 Chicago Bulls season|Bulls']] first-round series against the Celtics, scoring 63 points in a 2-OT loss, which surpassed [[Elgin Baylor]]'s 61-point performance from the [[1962 NBA Finals]] and still stands as the [[List of National Basketball Association players with 50 or more points in a playoff game|NBA Playoff scoring record]]. Jordan averaged 44.7 points per game in the series, but was unable to prevent the Bulls from being swept by a more experienced, more talented Celtics team. The Bulls set a dubious mark by posting the second worst record for a playoff-qualifying team in history, going just 30\u201352 during the season. Game 2, where the record was set, was ranked by ''[[TV Guide]]'' as the 26th Most Memorable Moment in Television History,{{citation needed|date=June 2014}} and is credited with boosting the NBA's popularity surge and eventual rise to near the top of the United States television sports market,{{citation needed|date=June 2014}} trailing only [[American football|football]] by the mid-90s.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}\n\nThe 1986 playoffs marked the third time in four years that the [[1985\u201386 Milwaukee Bucks season|Milwaukee Bucks]] advanced to the Eastern Conference Finals, but it would be their last appearance in the series until [[2001 NBA playoffs|2001]]. The Celtics avenged their [[1983 NBA playoffs|1983]] sweep by sweeping the Bucks in four games.\n\nAs for the [[1985\u201386 Philadelphia 76ers season|Philadelphia 76ers]], this was the last time they would play in a Game 7 until 2001. After their first round loss to the [[1985\u201386 Atlanta Hawks season|Atlanta Hawks]], the [[1985\u201386 Detroit Pistons season|Detroit Pistons]] would advance past the first round in each of the next five seasons ([[1987 NBA playoffs|1987]], [[1988 NBA playoffs|1988]], [[1989 NBA playoffs|1989]], [[1990 NBA playoffs|1990]], [[1991 NBA playoffs|1991]]), which include all appearances in the conference finals, three [[NBA Finals]], and two championships.\n\nAfter moving from [[Kansas City, Missouri|Kansas City]], where the franchise played its previous thirteen seasons, the [[Sacramento Kings]] made their first postseason appearance in their first season in its new city.\n\n==Bracket==\n{{16TeamBracket |\n\n| RD1=First Round\n| RD2=Conference Semifinals\n| RD3=Conference Finals\n|
