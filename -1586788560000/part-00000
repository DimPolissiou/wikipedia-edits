Compared to other social movements, the Chinese government has historically been more tolerant of HIV/AIDS-focused NGOs and civil society organizations, relying on them to reach out to marginalized groups most vulnerable to the disease. Even so, the government at all administrative levels has also often sought to suppress or minimize such activism perceived as sensitive, obscene, or a threat to stability.{{sfn|HRW|2005}} In 2007, activist [[Gao Yaojie]] was placed under house arrest in her home in [[Zhengzhou]] in order to prevent her from visiting the United States to receive an award from [[Vital Voices Global Partnership]] and meet with [[Hillary Clinton]].<ref name=\"NYT2007\">{{cite news |last1=Yardley |first1=Jim |title=China Places AIDS Activist Under House Arrest |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/02/06/world/asia/06china.html |accessdate=21 March 2020 |agency=The New York Times |date=6 February 2007}}</ref>\n\n==Socioeconomic effect==\nThe process of the effect of HIV/AIDS can be described as having three key stages: first, the effect experienced at the micro level; second, at the sectoral level; and finally, at the macro level. The effect began to be observed in China at the micro, or [[household]] level, and will most certainly be observed in the future at the sectoral level. Individuals and families have been bearing both the economic and social costs of the disease, and the poverty of those affected have increased and will further increase substantially. Expenditures for the health sector will increase, for both treatment and prevention interventions. The macro level has been mostly unaffected . But if without effective preventive action, the HIV spread in the general population at large will affect the macro level as have happened in some countries in sub-Saharan Africa.<ref>\"The Socioeconomic Impact of HIV/AIDS\" Research Team.

Sound production is divided into three categories:\n\n* Mechanical noise\u2014rotation of the engine parts, most noticeable when fan blades reach supersonic speeds.\n* Aerodynamic noise\u2014from the airflow around the surfaces of the aircraft, especially when flying low at high speeds.\n* Noise from aircraft systems\u2014cockpit and cabin pressurization and conditioning systems, and Auxiliary Power units. \n\nHealth consequences include sleep disturbance, hearing impairment and heart disease, as well as workplace accidents caused by stress. Memory and recall can also be affected. Governments have enacted extensive controls that apply to aircraft designers, manufacturers, and operators, resulting in improved procedures and cuts in pollution.\n\n==Mechanisms of sound production==\n[[Image:GrummanAA-5BTigerInFlight01.jpg|thumb|250px|Small [[general aviation]] aircraft produce localized aircraft noise.]]\n[[Image:RotorwayExec01.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Helicopter]] main and tail rotors produce aerodynamic noise.]]\n\nAircraft noise is [[noise pollution]] produced by an aircraft or its components, whether on the ground while parked such as auxiliary power units, while taxiing, on run-up from propeller and jet exhaust, during take off, underneath and lateral to departure and arrival paths, over-flying while en route, or during landing.{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}} A moving aircraft including the [[jet engine]] or [[Propeller (aircraft)|propeller]] causes compression and rarefaction of the air, producing motion of air molecules. This movement propagates through the air as pressure waves. If these pressure waves are strong enough and within the audible [[frequency]] spectrum, a sensation of hearing is produced. Different aircraft types have different noise levels and frequencies. The noise originates from three main sources:\n\n* Engine and other mechanical noise\n* Aerodynamic noise\n* Noise from aircraft systems\n\n===Engine and other mechanical noise===\n[[Image:Noise Research Program on Hangar Apron - GPN-2000-001457.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[NASA]] researchers at [[Glenn Research Center]] conducting tests on [[jet engine]] noise in 1967]]\nMuch of the noise in propeller aircraft comes equally from the propellers and aerodynamics. Helicopter noise is aerodynamically induced noise from the main and tail rotors and mechanically induced noise from the main gearbox and various transmission chains. The mechanical sources produce narrow band high intensity peaks relating to the rotational speed and movement of the moving parts. In [[computer model]]ling terms noise from a moving aircraft can be treated as a [[line source]].\n\nAircraft gas turbine engines ([[jet engine]]s) are responsible for much of the aircraft noise during takeoff and climb, such as the ''buzzsaw noise'' generated when the tips of the fan blades reach supersonic speeds. However, with advances in noise reduction technologies\u2014the airframe is typically more noisy during landing.{{citation needed|date=May 2008}}\n\nThe majority of engine noise is due to jet noise\u2014although high bypass-ratio [[turbofan]]s do have considerable fan noise. The high velocity jet leaving the back of the engine has an inherent shear layer instability (if not thick enough) and rolls up into ring vortices. This later breaks down into turbulence. The SPL associated with engine noise is proportional to the jet speed (to a high power). Therefore, even modest reductions in exhaust velocity will produce a large reduction in jet noise.{{citation needed|date=May 2008}}\n\nEngines are the main source of aircraft noise.<!--<ref name=AvWeek18dec2017>--> The geared [[Pratt & Whitney PW1000G]] helped reduce the noise levels of the [[Bombardier CSeries]], [[Mitsubishi MRJ]] and [[Embraer E-Jet E2]] crossover [[narrowbody aircraft]]: the gearbox allows the fan to spin at an optimal speed, which is one third the speed of the LP turbine, for slower fan tip speeds. It has a 75% smaller noise footprint than current equivalents.<!--<ref name=AvWeek18dec2017>--> The [[PowerJet SaM146]] in the [[Sukhoi Superjet 100]] features 3D [[aerodynamic]] fan blades and a [[nacelle]] with a long [[Exhaust mixer|mixed duct flow]] nozzle to reduce noise.<ref name=AvWeek18dec2017>{{cite news |url= http://aviationweek.com/crossover-narrowbody-jets/how-crossover-jets-are-meeting-noise-challenge |title= How Crossover Jets Are Meeting The Noise Challenge |date= Dec 18, 2017 |author= Bernie Baldwin |work= Aviation Week & Space Technology}}</ref>\n\n===Aerodynamic noise===\nAerodynamic noise arises from the airflow around the aircraft [[fuselage]] and control surfaces. This type of noise increases with aircraft speed and also at low altitudes due to the density of the air. Jet-powered aircraft create intense noise from [[aerodynamic]]s. Low-flying, high-speed military aircraft produce especially loud aerodynamic noise.\n\nThe shape of the nose, windshield or [[canopy (aircraft)|canopy]] of an aircraft affects the sound produced. Much of the noise of a propeller aircraft is of aerodynamic origin due to the flow of air around the blades. The [[helicopter]] main and tail rotors also give rise to aerodynamic noise. This type of aerodynamic noise is mostly low frequency determined by the rotor speed.\n\nTypically noise is generated when flow passes an object on the aircraft, for example, the wings or landing gear. There are broadly two main types of airframe noise:\n\n* Bluff Body Noise \u2013 the alternating vortex shedding from either side of a bluff body, creates low-pressure regions (at the core of the shed vortices) which manifest themselves as pressure waves (or sound). The separated flow around the bluff body is quite unstable, and the flow \"rolls up\" into ring vortices\u2014which later break down into turbulence.<ref name=\"bluff\">{{cite web|url=http://www2.eng.cam.ac.uk/~acf40/research_ov.htm |title=Aircraft Airframe Noise\u2014Research Overview |accessdate=2008-07-13 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080517104120/http://www2.eng.cam.ac.uk/~acf40/research_ov.htm |archivedate=2008-05-17 }}</ref>\n* Edge Noise \u2013 when turbulent flow passes the end of an object or gaps in a structure (high lift device clearance gaps) the associated fluctuations in pressure are heard as the sound propagates from the edge of the object (radially downwards).<ref name=\"bluff\"/>\n\n===Noise from aircraft systems===\n[[Cockpit]] and cabin [[pressurization]] and conditioning systems are often a major contributor within cabins of both civilian and military aircraft. However, one of the most significant sources of cabin noise from commercial jet aircraft, other than the engines, is the [[Auxiliary Power Unit]] (APU), an on\u2011board [[Electric generator|generator]] used in aircraft to start the main engines, usually with [[compressed air]], and to provide electrical power while the aircraft is on the ground. Other internal aircraft systems can also contribute, such as specialized electronic equipment in some military aircraft.\n\n==Health effects==\n{{Further|Health effects from noise}}\nAircraft engines are the major source of noise and can exceed 140 decibels (dB) during takeoff. While airborne, the main sources of noise are the engines and the high speed turbulence over the fuselage.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/aircrew/noise.html|title=AIRCREW SAFETY & HEALTH|last=NIOSH|date=May 9, 2017|website=|access-date=June 29, 2018}}</ref> \n\nThere are [[health]] consequences of elevated [[Sound exposure level|sound level]]s.

As another indicator, a night-time average sound pressure level of 55 [[decibels]] increased the risk of heart attacks by 66% in men and 139% in women. Statistically significant health effects did however start as early as from an average sound pressure level of 40 [[decibels]].<ref name=\"T\u00f6dlicher L\u00e4rm' 2009, Page 45\"/>\n\n===FAA advice===\nThe Federal Aviation Administration ([[Federal Aviation Administration|FAA]]) regulates the maximum noise level that individual civil aircraft can emit through requiring aircraft to meet certain noise certification standards. These standards designate changes in maximum noise level requirements by \"stage\" designation. The U.S. noise standards are defined in the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Title 14 Part 36 \u2013 Noise Standards: Aircraft Type and Airworthiness Certification (14 CFR Part 36).

Aircraft designers, manufacturers, and operators have developed quieter aircraft and better operating procedures. Modern high-bypass [[turbofan]] engines, for example, are quieter than the [[turbojet]]s and low-bypass turbofans of the 1960s. First, FAA Aircraft Certification achieved noise reductions classified as \"Stage&nbsp;3\" aircraft; which has been upgraded to \"Stage&nbsp;4\" noise certification resulting in quieter aircraft. This has resulted in lower noise exposures in spite of increased traffic growth and popularity.<ref name=\"Stage 4 Aircraft Noise Standards\">{{cite web|url=http://rgl.faa.gov/Regulatory_and_Guidance_Library/rgFinalRule.nsf/0/767f48f6311bfa348625703700522b0b!OpenDocument |title=Stage 4 Aircraft Noise Standards |publisher=Rgl.faa.gov |date= |accessdate=2012-09-28}}</ref>\n\nIn the 1980s the [[U.S. Congress]] authorized the [[FAA]] to devise programs to insulate homes near airports. While this does not address the external noise, the program has been effective for residential interiors. Some of the first airports at which the technology was applied were [[San Francisco International Airport]] and [[San Jose International Airport]] in California. A computer model is used which simulates the effects of aircraft noise upon building structures. Variations of aircraft type, flight patterns and local [[meteorology]] can be studied.

The study found that steeper angles for take-off and landing led to fewer people experiencing aircraft noise and that noise relief could be shared by using more precise flight paths, allowing control of the noise footprint of departing aircraft. Noise relief could be enhanced by switching flight paths, for example by using one flight path in the morning and another in the afternoon.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.heathrow.com/noise/future-plans/modernising-uk-airspace|title=Modernising UK airspace|work=heathrow.com|accessdate=24 September 2015}}</ref>\n\n=== Technological advances ===\n\n==== Engine design ====\nModern [[High bypass]] turbofans are not only more [[fuel economy in aircraft|fuel efficient]], but also much quieter than older turbojet and low-bypass turbofan engines.

Sound production is divided into three categories:\n\n* Mechanical noise\u2014rotation of the engine parts, most noticeable when fan blades reach supersonic speeds.\n* Aerodynamic noise\u2014from the airflow around the surfaces of the aircraft, especially when flying low at high speeds.\n* Noise from aircraft systems\u2014cockpit and cabin pressurization and conditioning systems, and Auxiliary Power units. \n\nHealth consequences include sleep disturbance, hearing impairment and heart disease, as well as workplace accidents caused by stress. Memory and recall can also be affected. Governments have enacted extensive controls that apply to aircraft designers, manufacturers, and operators, resulting in improved procedures and cuts in pollution.\n\n==Mechanisms of sound production==\n[[Image:GrummanAA-5BTigerInFlight01.jpg|thumb|250px|Small [[general aviation]] aircraft produce localized aircraft noise.]]\n[[Image:RotorwayExec01.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Helicopter]] main and tail rotors produce aerodynamic noise.]]\n\nAircraft noise is [[noise pollution]] produced by an aircraft or its components, whether on the ground while parked such as auxiliary power units, while taxiing, on run-up from propeller and jet exhaust, during take off, underneath and lateral to departure and arrival paths, over-flying while en route, or during landing.{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}} A moving aircraft including the [[jet engine]] or [[Propeller (aircraft)|propeller]] causes compression and rarefaction of the air, producing motion of air molecules. This movement propagates through the air as pressure waves. If these pressure waves are strong enough and within the audible [[frequency]] spectrum, a sensation of hearing is produced. Different aircraft types have different noise levels and frequencies. The noise originates from three main sources:\n\n* Engine and other mechanical noise\n* Aerodynamic noise\n* Noise from aircraft systems\n\n===Engine and other mechanical noise===\n[[Image:Noise Research Program on Hangar Apron - GPN-2000-001457.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[NASA]] researchers at [[Glenn Research Center]] conducting tests on [[jet engine]] noise in 1967]]\nMuch of the noise in propeller aircraft comes equally from the propellers and aerodynamics. Helicopter noise is aerodynamically induced noise from the main and tail rotors and mechanically induced noise from the main gearbox and various transmission chains. The mechanical sources produce narrow band high intensity peaks relating to the rotational speed and movement of the moving parts. In [[computer model]]ling terms noise from a moving aircraft can be treated as a [[line source]].\n\nAircraft gas turbine engines ([[jet engine]]s) are responsible for much of the aircraft noise during takeoff and climb, such as the ''buzzsaw noise'' generated when the tips of the fan blades reach supersonic speeds. However, with advances in noise reduction technologies\u2014the airframe is typically more noisy during landing.{{citation needed|date=May 2008}}\n\nThe majority of engine noise is due to jet noise\u2014although high bypass-ratio [[turbofan]]s do have considerable fan noise. The high velocity jet leaving the back of the engine has an inherent shear layer instability (if not thick enough) and rolls up into ring vortices. This later breaks down into turbulence. The SPL associated with engine noise is proportional to the jet speed (to a high power). Therefore, even modest reductions in exhaust velocity will produce a large reduction in jet noise.{{citation needed|date=May 2008}}\n\nEngines are the main source of aircraft noise.<!--<ref name=AvWeek18dec2017>--> The geared [[Pratt & Whitney PW1000G]] helped reduce the noise levels of the [[Bombardier CSeries]], [[Mitsubishi MRJ]] and [[Embraer E-Jet E2]] crossover [[narrowbody aircraft]]: the gearbox allows the fan to spin at an optimal speed, which is one third the speed of the LP turbine, for slower fan tip speeds.

This type of noise increases with aircraft speed and also at low altitudes due to the density of the air. Jet-powered aircraft create intense noise from [[aerodynamic]]s. Low-flying, high-speed military aircraft produce especially loud aerodynamic noise.\n\nThe shape of the nose, windshield or [[canopy (aircraft)|canopy]] of an aircraft affects the sound produced. Much of the noise of a propeller aircraft is of aerodynamic origin due to the flow of air around the blades. The [[helicopter]] main and tail rotors also give rise to aerodynamic noise. This type of aerodynamic noise is mostly low frequency determined by the rotor speed.\n\nTypically noise is generated when flow passes an object on the aircraft, for example, the wings or landing gear. There are broadly two main types of airframe noise:\n\n* Bluff Body Noise \u2013 the alternating vortex shedding from either side of a bluff body, creates low-pressure regions (at the core of the shed vortices) which manifest themselves as pressure waves (or sound). The separated flow around the bluff body is quite unstable, and the flow \"rolls up\" into ring vortices\u2014which later break down into turbulence.<ref name=\"bluff\">{{cite web|url=http://www2.eng.cam.ac.uk/~acf40/research_ov.htm |title=Aircraft Airframe Noise\u2014Research Overview |accessdate=2008-07-13 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080517104120/http://www2.eng.cam.ac.uk/~acf40/research_ov.htm |archivedate=2008-05-17 }}</ref>\n* Edge Noise \u2013 when turbulent flow passes the end of an object or gaps in a structure (high lift device clearance gaps) the associated fluctuations in pressure are heard as the sound propagates from the edge of the object (radially downwards).<ref name=\"bluff\"/>\n\n===Noise from aircraft systems===\n[[Cockpit]] and cabin [[pressurization]] and conditioning systems are often a major contributor within cabins of both civilian and military aircraft. However, one of the most significant sources of cabin noise from commercial jet aircraft, other than the engines, is the [[Auxiliary Power Unit]] (APU), an on\u2011board [[Electric generator|generator]] used in aircraft to start the main engines, usually with [[compressed air]], and to provide electrical power while the aircraft is on the ground. Other internal aircraft systems can also contribute, such as specialized electronic equipment in some military aircraft.\n\n==Health effects==\n{{Further|Health effects from noise}}\nAircraft engines are the major source of noise and can exceed 140 decibels (dB) during takeoff. While airborne, the main sources of noise are the engines and the high speed turbulence over the fuselage.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/aircrew/noise.html|title=AIRCREW SAFETY & HEALTH|last=NIOSH|date=May 9, 2017|website=|access-date=June 29, 2018}}</ref> \n\nThere are [[health]] consequences of elevated [[Sound exposure level|sound level]]s.

Aircraft designers, manufacturers, and operators have developed quieter aircraft and better operating procedures. Modern high-bypass [[turbofan]] engines, for example, are quieter than the [[turbojet]]s and low-bypass turbofans of the 1960s. First, FAA Aircraft Certification achieved noise reductions classified as \"Stage&nbsp;3\" aircraft; which has been upgraded to \"Stage&nbsp;4\" noise certification resulting in quieter aircraft. This has resulted in lower noise exposures in spite of increased traffic growth and popularity.<ref name=\"Stage 4 Aircraft Noise Standards\">{{cite web|url=http://rgl.faa.gov/Regulatory_and_Guidance_Library/rgFinalRule.nsf/0/767f48f6311bfa348625703700522b0b!OpenDocument |title=Stage 4 Aircraft Noise Standards |publisher=Rgl.faa.gov |date= |accessdate=2012-09-28}}</ref>\n\nIn the 1980s the [[U.S. Congress]] authorized the [[FAA]] to devise programs to insulate homes near airports. While this does not address the external noise, the program has been effective for residential interiors. Some of the first airports at which the technology was applied were [[San Francisco International Airport]] and [[San Jose International Airport]] in California. A computer model is used which simulates the effects of aircraft noise upon building structures. Variations of aircraft type, flight patterns and local [[meteorology]] can be studied. Then the benefits of building retrofit strategies such as roof upgrading, window [[insulated glazing|glazing]] improvement, fireplace baffling, [[caulking]] construction seams can be evaluated.<ref name=\"Hogan\">Hogan, C.

The trials demonstrated that using satellite-based navigation systems it was possible to offer noise relief to more surrounding communities, although this led to a significant unexpected rise in noise complaints (61,650 <ref>Anderson Acoustics, [https://www.heathrow.com/file_source/HeathrowNoise/Static/Noise_impacts_Community_Response_easterly_and_westerly_trials_2014.pdf Westerly And Easterly Departure Trials 2014 - Noise Analysis & Community Response], retrieved 29 November 2017</ref>) due to the concentrated flight paths. The study found that steeper angles for take-off and landing led to fewer people experiencing aircraft noise and that noise relief could be shared by using more precise flight paths, allowing control of the noise footprint of departing aircraft. Noise relief could be enhanced by switching flight paths, for example by using one flight path in the morning and another in the afternoon.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.heathrow.com/noise/future-plans/modernising-uk-airspace|title=Modernising UK airspace|work=heathrow.com|accessdate=24 September 2015}}</ref>\n\n=== Technological advances ===\n\n==== Engine design ====\nModern [[High bypass]] turbofans are not only more [[fuel economy in aircraft|fuel efficient]], but also much quieter than older turbojet and low-bypass turbofan engines.

NASA expects a cumulative 20\u201330 dB below Stage 4 limits by 2026\u20132031, but keeping aircraft noise within [[airport]] boundaries requires at least a 40\u201350 dB reduction.<!--<ref name=AvWeek6may2016/>--> [[Landing gear]], [[wing slat]]s and [[wing flap]]s also produce noise and may have to be shielded from the ground with new configurations.<!--<ref name=AvWeek6may2016/>--> NASA found over-wing and mid-fuselage nacelles could reduce noise by 30\u201340 dB, even 40\u201350 dB for [[hybrid wing body]] which may be essential for open rotors.<ref name=\"AvWeek6may2016\" />\n\nBy 2020, [[helicopter]] technologies now in development, plus new procedures could reduce noise levels by 10 dB and noise footprints by 50%, but more advances are needed to preserve or expand [[heliport]]s.<!--<ref name=AvWeek6may2016/>--> Package delivery [[Unmanned aircraft system|UAS]] will need to characterize their noise, establish limits and reduce their impact.<ref name=AvWeek6may2016>{{cite news |url= http://aviationweek.com/technology-milestones/problems-aerospace-still-has-solve |title= Problems Aerospace Still Has To Solve |date= May 6, 2016 |author= Graham Warwick |work= Aviation Week & Space Technology}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Aviation taxation and subsidies]]\n*[[Electric airplane]]\n*[[Farley v Skinner]]\n*[[Hush kit]]\n*[[Helicopter noise reduction]]\n*[[Jet noise]]\n*[[Noise barrier]]\n*[[Rotor-stator interaction]]\n*[[Silent Aircraft Initiative]]\n*[[Train noise]]\n*[[XF-84H Thunderscreech]], the loudest aircraft ever built.\n\n'''General:'''\n*[[Health effects from noise]]\n*[[Noise pollution]]\n*[[Noise regulation]]\n*[[Aviation and the environment]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n*''U.S. Noise Control Act of 1972'' United States [[Code]] Citation: 42 U.S.C. 4901 to 4918\n*S.
