Their ideology revolves around three pillars: the Land of Israel, the People of Israel, and the Torah of Israel.<ref>[[Adriana Kemp]], ''Israelis in Conflict: Hegemonies, Identities, and Challenges'', Sussex Academic Press, 2004, pp.314\u2013315.</ref>\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Abraham Isaac Kook 1924.jpg|thumb|[[Abraham Isaac Kook]], 1924]]\n\nIn 1862, German Orthodox [[Rabbi]] [[Zvi Hirsch Kalischer]] published his tractate ''Derishat Zion'', positing that the salvation of the Jews, promised by the [[Nevi'im|Prophets]], can come about only by self-help.<ref>[http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=56&letter=K Zvi Hirsch Kalischer] (Jewish Encyclopedia)</ref> Rabbi [[Moshe Shmuel Glasner]] was another prominent rabbi who supported Zionism. The main ideologue of modern Religious Zionism was Rabbi [[Abraham Isaac Kook]], who justified Zionism according to [[Halakha|Jewish law]], and urged young religious Jews to support efforts to settle the land, and the secular [[Labour Zionist]]s to give more consideration to Judaism. Kook saw Zionism as a part of a divine scheme which would result in the resettlement of the Jewish people in its homeland. This would bring salvation (\"Geula\") to Jews, and then to the entire world. After world harmony is achieved by the refoundation of the Jewish homeland, the [[Messiah]] will come. Although this has not yet happened, Kook emphasized that it would take time, and that the ultimate redemption happens in stages, often not apparent while happening. In 1924, when Kook became the [[Ashkenazi]] [[Chief Rabbi]] of [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]], he tried to reconcile Zionism with [[Orthodox Judaism]].\n\n== Ideology ==\n[[File:Jerusalem Day.jpg|thumb|Religious Zionists celebrating [[Jerusalem Day]]]]\nReligious Zionists believe that \"[[Eretz Israel|Eretz Yisrael]]\" (the Land of Israel) was promised to the ancient [[Israelites]] by [[God in Judaism|God]].  Furthermore, modern Jews have the obligation to possess and defend the land in ways that comport with the [[Torah]]'s high standards of justice.<ref>Novak, David.  [https://mosaicmagazine.com/response/politics-current-affairs/2020/01/what-unites-people-of-faith-across-religions-and-divides-them-from-others/ \"What Unites People of Faith across Religions, and Divides Them from Others.\"] ''Mosaic''.  23 January 2020.  23 January 2020.</ref> To generations of [[Jewish diaspora|diaspora Jews]], [[Jerusalem]] has been a symbol of the [[Holy Land]] and of their return to it, as promised by God in numerous [[Bible|Biblical prophecies]]. Despite this, many Jews did not embrace Zionism before the 1930s, and certain religious groups opposed it then, as some groups still do now, on the grounds that an attempt to re-establish Jewish rule in Israel by [[human agency]] was blasphemous. Hastening salvation and the coming of the Messiah was considered religiously forbidden, and Zionism was seen as a sign of disbelief in God's power, and therefore, a rebellion against God. Rabbi Kook developed a [[theology|theological]] answer to that claim, which gave Zionism a religious legitimation: \"Zionism was not merely a political movement by secular Jews. It was actually a tool of [[God]] to promote His divine scheme, and to initiate the return of the Jews to their homeland \u2013 the land He promised to [[Abraham]], [[Isaac]], and [[Jacob]]. God wants the [[children of Israel]] to return to their home in order to establish a Jewish sovereign state in which Jews could live according to the laws of [[Torah]] and [[Halakha]], and commit the [[Mitzvah|Mitzvot]] of Eretz Israel (these are religious commandments which can be performed only in the [[Land of Israel]]). Moreover, to cultivate the Land of Israel was a Mitzvah by itself, and it should be carried out. Therefore, settling [[Eretz Israel|Israel]] is an obligation of the religious Jews, and helping Zionism is actually following God's will.\"<ref>{{cite book |title=Torat Eretz Yisrael|first=David|last=Samson|author2=Tzvi Fishman |publisher=Torat Eretz Yisrael Publications|location=Jerusalem |year=1991}}</ref>\n\nReligious Jews also disapproved of the Zionists because many were secular Jews or [[atheist]]s, taking their cue from [[Marxism]]. [[Labour Zionism|Socialist Zionism]] envisaged the movement as a tool for building an advanced [[socialist]] society in the land of Israel, while solving the problem of [[antisemitism]]. The early [[kibbutz]] was a communal settlement that focused on national goals, unencumbered by religion and precepts of Jewish law such as [[kashrut]]. Socialist Zionists were one of the results of a long process of modernization within the Jewish communities of Europe, known as the [[Haskalah]], or Jewish Enlightenment. Rabbi Kook's answer was as follows:\n\n:''Secular Zionists may think they do it for political, national, or socialist reasons, but in fact \u2013 the actual reason for them coming to resettle in [[Eretz Israel|Israel]] is a religious Jewish spark (\"Nitzotz\") in their [[soul]], planted by God. Without their knowledge, they are contributing to the divine scheme and actually committing a great [[Mitzvah]].''\n\n:''The role of religious Zionists is to help them to establish a Jewish state and turn the religious spark in them into a great light. They should show them that the real source of Zionism and the longed-for Zion is [[Judaism]] and teach them [[Torah]] with love and kindness. In the end, they will understand that the laws of [[Torah]] are the key to true [[harmony]] and a [[socialist]] state (not in the [[Marxist]] [[Socialist mode of production|meaning]]) that will be a light for the [[goyim|nations]] and bring salvation to the world.''\n\n[[Shlomo Avineri]] explained the last part of Kook's answer: \"... and the end of those pioneers, who scout into the blindness of secularism and atheism, but the treasured light inside them leads them into the path of salvation \u2013 their end is that from doing Mitzva without purpose, they will do Mitzva with a purpose.\" (page 222, <sup>[[Religious Zionist Movement#References|1]]</sup>)\n\n== Organizations ==\n[[File:Bnei akiva logo.jpg|thumb|100px|left|[[Bnei Akiva]] youth movement, combining Torah and work]]\n\nThe first rabbis to support Zionism were [[Judah Alkalai|Yehuda Shlomo Alkalai]] and [[Zvi Hirsch Kalischer]]. They argued that the change in the status of [[Western Europe]]'s Jews following [[Jewish emancipation|emancipation]] was the first step toward redemption (\u05d2\u05d0\u05d5\u05dc\u05d4), and that, therefore, one must hasten the messianic salvation by a natural salvation \u2013 whose main pillars are the [[Kibbutz Galuyot]] (\"Gathering of the Exiles\"), the return to Eretz Israel, agricultural work (\u05e2\u05d1\u05d5\u05d3\u05ea \u05d0\u05d3\u05de\u05d4), and the revival of the everyday use of the [[Hebrew language]].\n\nThe [[Mizrachi (Religious Zionism)|Mizrachi]] organization was established in 1902 in [[Vilna]] at a world conference of Religious Zionists. It operates a [[Zionist youth movement|youth movement]], [[Bnei Akiva]], which was founded in 1929. Mizrachi believes that the [[Torah]] should be at the centre of [[Zionism]], a sentiment expressed in the Mizrachi Zionist slogan ''Am Yisrael B'Eretz Yisrael al pi Torat Yisrael'' (\"The people of Israel in the land of Israel according to the Torah of Israel\"). It also sees Jewish nationalism as a tool for achieving religious objectives. Mizrachi was the first official Religious Zionist party. It also built a network of religious schools that exist to this day.\n\nIn 1937-1948, the [[Religious Kibbutz Movement]] established three settlement blocs of three kibbutzim each. The first was in the [[Beit Shean]] Valley, the second was in the [[Hebron]] mountains south of [[Bethlehem]] (known as [[Gush Etzion]]), and the third was in the western [[Negev]]. Kibbutz [[Yavne]] was founded in the center of the country as the core of a fourth bloc that came into being after the establishment of the state.<ref>\"Settlement clustering on a socio-cultural basis: The bloc settlement policy of the Religious Kibbutz Movement in Palestine,\" Yossi Katz, ''Journal of Rural Studies'', vol. 11, no. 2, pp. 161\u2013171, 1995</ref>\n\n== Political parties ==\nThe [[Labor Movement]] wing of Religious Zionism, founded in 1921 under the Zionist slogan \"Torah va'Avodah\" (Torah and Labor), was called [[Hapoel HaMizrachi]]. It represented religiously traditional [[Labour Zionism|Labour Zionists]], both in Europe and in the Land of Israel, where it represented religious Jews in the [[Histadrut]]. In 1956, Mizrachi, Hapoel HaMizrachi, and other religious Zionists formed the [[National Religious Party]] to advance the rights of religious Zionist Jews in Israel. Other parties and groups affiliated with religious Zionism are [[Gush Emunim]], [[Tkuma (political party)|Tkuma]], and [[Meimad]]. [[Kahanism]], a radical branch of religious Zionism, was founded by Rabbi [[Meir Kahane]], whose party, [[Kach and Kahane Chai|Kach]], was eventually banned for [[racism]]. Today, [[Otzma Yehudit]] is the leading wing of this school of thought.\n\n== Educational institutions ==\n:''See: [[Yeshiva #Israel]]; [[:Category:Religious Zionist yeshivot]]; [[List of Midrashot]].''\n[[File:Mercaz HaRav01.JPG|thumb|[[Mercaz Harav]], Jerusalem]]\nThe flagship religious institution of the Religious Zionist movement is the [[yeshiva]] founded by Rabbi Abraham Isaac Kook in 1924, called in his honor \"[[Mercaz haRav]]\" (lit., the Rabbi's center). \nOther Religious Zionist yeshivot include [[Ateret Cohanim]], [[Beit El yeshiva]] and Yeshivat [[Or Etzion]], founded by Rav [[Haim Druckman]], a foremost disciple of Rabbi [[Tzvi Yehuda Kook]].\n\nThere are also approximately 90 ''[[Hesder]]'' yeshivot, allowing students to continue [[Torah study]] during their National Service (see [[#Military_service|below]]).\nThe first was [[Yeshivat Kerem B'Yavneh]], established in 1954; the largest is the [[Hesder Yeshiva of Sderot]] with over 800 students.\nOthers well known include [[Machon Meir|Yeshivat Machon Meir]], [[Yeshivat Har Etzion]], [[Yeshivat HaKotel]], [[Yeshivat Birkat Moshe]] in [[Maale Adumim]], [[Yeshiva Har Bracha|Yeshivat Har Bracha]] and Yeshivat Har Hamor.  \n\nThese institutions usually offer a [[kollel]] for ''[[Semikha]]'', or Rabbinic ordination. Students generally prepare for the ''Semikha'' test of the [[Chief Rabbinate of Israel]]; often for that of the [[posek]] R. [[Zalman Nechemia Goldberg]].\nTraining as a [[Dayan (rabbinic judge)]] in this community is usually through [[:he:\u05de\u05db\u05d5\u05df \u05d0\u05e8\u05d9\u05d0\u05dc|''Machon Ariel'']] (''[[Machon Harry Fischel]]''), also founded by Rav Kook, or [[:he:\u05d0\u05e8\u05e5_\u05d7\u05de\u05d3\u05d4_(\u05db\u05d5\u05dc\u05dc) |''Kollel Eretz Hemda'']].\n\nWomen study in institutions known as ''Midrashot'' (sing. [[Midrasha]]) - examples are [[Ein_HaNetziv#Education|Ein HaNatziv Women's Seminary]] and [[Migdal Oz (seminary)|Migdal Oz]]. Some also offer degree studies (and may then be known as a ''machon'').\n[[Nishmat (midrasha)|Nishmat]] trains women as [[Yoetzet Halacha|Yoatzot Halacha]]; see also [[Midreshet Lindenbaum]] and [[Matan Women's Institute for Torah Studies|Matan]], which similarly offer Talmud focused learning to women.\n\nHigh school students study at [[Education_in_Israel#Educational_tracks|''Mamlachti dati'']] schools, often associated with ''[[Bnei Akiva]]''. The first of these was at [[Kfar Haroeh]] established by [[Moshe-Zvi Neria]]. A girls' high school is referred to as an ''[[Ulpana]]''.\nFor degree studies, many attend [[Bar Ilan University]], which allows students to combine Yeshiva studies with university study; \n[[Jerusalem College of Technology]] similarly (which also offers a Haredi track).\nThere are also [[List_of_Israeli_universities_and_colleges#Colleges|several colleges of education]] associated with Hesder and the ''Midrashot'', such as [[Herzog College]] and the [[Lifshitz College of Education]]. These often allow specializations in [[Tanach]] and ''Machshava'' ([[Jewish thought]]).\n\nSome institutions are aligned with the ''[[Hardal]]'' (\u1e24aredi Le'umi) community, with an ideology that is somewhat more \"statist\".\nThe leading Yeshiva here is [[Har Hamor]]; [[Hardal#Schools|several high schools]] also operate.\n\n== Dress ==\nReligious Zionists are often called ''Kippot sruggot'', referring to the knitted or crocheted [[kippot|skullcaps]] (Hebrew ''kippa'', pl. ''kippot'') worn by many of the men. (However, there are also men who wear other types of headcoverings, such as ''kippot'' in black velvet.) \nTheir dress, otherwise, is largely the same as for secular Israelis.\nWomen usually wear skirts, and often cover their hair.\nSee under [[Tzniut]]: [[Tzniut#Dress|#Dress]] and [[Tzniut#Hair covering|#Hair covering]].\n\nIn the ''Hardal'' community, the dress is generally more formal, with an emphasis on appearing neat.  \nThe Kippot, also knitted, are significantly larger, and it is common for [[tzitzit]] to be worn visibly, as is the [[Haredi]] practice; ''[[Payot]]'' (sidelocks) are common, and an (untrimmed) beard.\nWomen invariably cover their hair - usually with a [[snood]], or a ''mitpachat'' (Hebrew for \"kerchief\") - and often wear sandals.\n\nAt prayer, members of the community use the [[Koren Siddur]] or ''[[Rinat Yisrael]]''.\n\n== Politics ==\nMost Religious Zionists embrace [[right-wing]] politics, especially the religious right-wing [[Jewish Home]] party, but also support the mainstream right-wing [[Likud]]. There are also some left-wing Religious Zionists, such as Rabbi [[Michael Melchior]], whose views were represented by the [[Meimad]] party (which ran together with the [[Labor (Israel)|Israeli Labor party]]). Many Israeli [[Israeli settlements|settlers]] in the [[West Bank]] are Religious Zionists, along with most of the settlers forcibly expelled from the [[Gaza Strip]] in August and September 2005.\n\n== Military service ==\n{{unreferencedsect|date=November 2015}}\n[[File:IDF soldier put on tefillin.jpg|thumb|Second-Lieutenant [[From the Wilderness and Lebanon|Asael Lubotzky]], an [[Israel Defense Forces|IDF]] field commander during [[Second Lebanon War]], prays with [[Tefilin]]]]\nAll adult Jewish males in Israel are obligated to serve in the [[Israel Defense Forces|IDF]]. Certain segments of Orthodoxy defer their service in order to engage in full-time Torah study.

Their ideology revolves around three pillars: the Land of Israel, the People of Israel, and the Torah of Israel.<ref>[[Adriana Kemp]], ''Israelis in Conflict: Hegemonies, Identities, and Challenges'', Sussex Academic Press, 2004, pp.314\u2013315.</ref>\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Abraham Isaac Kook 1924.jpg|thumb|[[Abraham Isaac Kook]], 1924]]\n\nIn 1862, German Orthodox [[Rabbi]] [[Zvi Hirsch Kalischer]] published his tractate ''Derishat Zion'', positing that the salvation of the Jews, promised by the [[Nevi'im|Prophets]], can come about only by self-help.<ref>[http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=56&letter=K Zvi Hirsch Kalischer] (Jewish Encyclopedia)</ref> Rabbi [[Moshe Shmuel Glasner]] was another prominent rabbi who supported Zionism. The main ideologue of modern Religious Zionism was Rabbi [[Abraham Isaac Kook]], who justified Zionism according to [[Halakha|Jewish law]], and urged young religious Jews to support efforts to settle the land, and the secular [[Labour Zionist]]s to give more consideration to Judaism. Kook saw Zionism as a part of a divine scheme which would result in the resettlement of the Jewish people in its homeland. This would bring salvation (\"Geula\") to Jews, and then to the entire world. After world harmony is achieved by the refoundation of the Jewish homeland, the [[Messiah]] will come. Although this has not yet happened, Kook emphasized that it would take time, and that the ultimate redemption happens in stages, often not apparent while happening. In 1924, when Kook became the [[Ashkenazi]] [[Chief Rabbi]] of [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]], he tried to reconcile Zionism with [[Orthodox Judaism]].\n\n== Ideology ==\n[[File:Jerusalem Day.jpg|thumb|Religious Zionists celebrating [[Jerusalem Day]]]]\nReligious Zionists believe that \"[[Eretz Israel|Eretz Yisrael]]\" (the Land of Israel) was promised to the ancient [[Israelites]] by [[God in Judaism|God]].  Furthermore, modern Jews have the obligation to possess and defend the land in ways that comport with the [[Torah]]'s high standards of justice.<ref>Novak, David.  [https://mosaicmagazine.com/response/politics-current-affairs/2020/01/what-unites-people-of-faith-across-religions-and-divides-them-from-others/ \"What Unites People of Faith across Religions, and Divides Them from Others.\"] ''Mosaic''.  23 January 2020.  23 January 2020.</ref> To generations of [[Jewish diaspora|diaspora Jews]], [[Jerusalem]] has been a symbol of the [[Holy Land]] and of their return to it, as promised by God in numerous [[Bible|Biblical prophecies]]. Despite this, many Jews did not embrace Zionism before the 1930s, and certain religious groups opposed it then, as some groups still do now, on the grounds that an attempt to re-establish Jewish rule in Israel by [[human agency]] was blasphemous. Hastening salvation and the coming of the Messiah was considered religiously forbidden, and Zionism was seen as a sign of disbelief in God's power, and therefore, a rebellion against God. Rabbi Kook developed a [[theology|theological]] answer to that claim, which gave Zionism a religious legitimation: \"Zionism was not merely a political movement by secular Jews. It was actually a tool of [[God]] to promote His divine scheme, and to initiate the return of the Jews to their homeland \u2013 the land He promised to [[Abraham]], [[Isaac]], and [[Jacob]]. God wants the [[children of Israel]] to return to their home in order to establish a Jewish sovereign state in which Jews could live according to the laws of [[Torah]] and [[Halakha]], and commit the [[Mitzvah|Mitzvot]] of Eretz Israel (these are religious commandments which can be performed only in the [[Land of Israel]]). Moreover, to cultivate the Land of Israel was a Mitzvah by itself, and it should be carried out. Therefore, settling [[Eretz Israel|Israel]] is an obligation of the religious Jews, and helping Zionism is actually following God's will.\"<ref>{{cite book |title=Torat Eretz Yisrael|first=David|last=Samson|author2=Tzvi Fishman |publisher=Torat Eretz Yisrael Publications|location=Jerusalem |year=1991}}</ref>\n\nReligious Jews also disapproved of the Zionists because many were secular Jews or [[atheist]]s, taking their cue from [[Marxism]]. [[Labour Zionism|Socialist Zionism]] envisaged the movement as a tool for building an advanced [[socialist]] society in the land of Israel, while solving the problem of [[antisemitism]]. The early [[kibbutz]] was a communal settlement that focused on national goals, unencumbered by religion and precepts of Jewish law such as [[kashrut]]. Socialist Zionists were one of the results of a long process of modernization within the Jewish communities of Europe, known as the [[Haskalah]], or Jewish Enlightenment. Rabbi Kook's answer was as follows:\n\n:''Secular Zionists may think they do it for political, national, or socialist reasons, but in fact \u2013 the actual reason for them coming to resettle in [[Eretz Israel|Israel]] is a religious Jewish spark (\"Nitzotz\") in their [[soul]], planted by God. Without their knowledge, they are contributing to the divine scheme and actually committing a great [[Mitzvah]].''\n\n:''The role of religious Zionists is to help them to establish a Jewish state and turn the religious spark in them into a great light. They should show them that the real source of Zionism and the longed-for Zion is [[Judaism]] and teach them [[Torah]] with love and kindness. In the end, they will understand that the laws of [[Torah]] are the key to true [[harmony]] and a [[socialist]] state (not in the [[Marxist]] [[Socialist mode of production|meaning]]) that will be a light for the [[goyim|nations]] and bring salvation to the world.''\n\n[[Shlomo Avineri]] explained the last part of Kook's answer: \"... and the end of those pioneers, who scout into the blindness of secularism and atheism, but the treasured light inside them leads them into the path of salvation \u2013 their end is that from doing Mitzva without purpose, they will do Mitzva with a purpose.\" (page 222, <sup>[[Religious Zionist Movement#References|1]]</sup>)\n\n== Organizations ==\n[[File:Bnei akiva logo.jpg|thumb|100px|left|[[Bnei Akiva]] youth movement, combining Torah and work]]\n\nThe first rabbis to support Zionism were [[Judah Alkalai|Yehuda Shlomo Alkalai]] and [[Zvi Hirsch Kalischer]]. They argued that the change in the status of [[Western Europe]]'s Jews following [[Jewish emancipation|emancipation]] was the first step toward redemption (\u05d2\u05d0\u05d5\u05dc\u05d4), and that, therefore, one must hasten the messianic salvation by a natural salvation \u2013 whose main pillars are the [[Kibbutz Galuyot]] (\"Gathering of the Exiles\"), the return to Eretz Israel, agricultural work (\u05e2\u05d1\u05d5\u05d3\u05ea \u05d0\u05d3\u05de\u05d4), and the revival of the everyday use of the [[Hebrew language]].\n\nThe [[Mizrachi (Religious Zionism)|Mizrachi]] organization was established in 1902 in [[Vilna]] at a world conference of Religious Zionists. It operates a [[Zionist youth movement|youth movement]], [[Bnei Akiva]], which was founded in 1929. Mizrachi believes that the [[Torah]] should be at the centre of [[Zionism]], a sentiment expressed in the Mizrachi Zionist slogan ''Am Yisrael B'Eretz Yisrael al pi Torat Yisrael'' (\"The people of Israel in the land of Israel according to the Torah of Israel\"). It also sees Jewish nationalism as a tool for achieving religious objectives. Mizrachi was the first official Religious Zionist party. It also built a network of religious schools that exist to this day.\n\nIn 1937-1948, the [[Religious Kibbutz Movement]] established three settlement blocs of three kibbutzim each. The first was in the [[Beit Shean]] Valley, the second was in the [[Hebron]] mountains south of [[Bethlehem]] (known as [[Gush Etzion]]), and the third was in the western [[Negev]]. Kibbutz [[Yavne]] was founded in the center of the country as the core of a fourth bloc that came into being after the establishment of the state.<ref>\"Settlement clustering on a socio-cultural basis: The bloc settlement policy of the Religious Kibbutz Movement in Palestine,\" Yossi Katz, ''Journal of Rural Studies'', vol. 11, no. 2, pp. 161\u2013171, 1995</ref>\n\n== Political parties ==\nThe [[Labor Movement]] wing of Religious Zionism, founded in 1921 under the Zionist slogan \"Torah va'Avodah\" (Torah and Labor), was called [[Hapoel HaMizrachi]]. It represented religiously traditional [[Labour Zionism|Labour Zionists]], both in Europe and in the Land of Israel, where it represented religious Jews in the [[Histadrut]]. In 1956, Mizrachi, Hapoel HaMizrachi, and other religious Zionists formed the [[National Religious Party]] to advance the rights of religious Zionist Jews in Israel. Other parties and groups affiliated with religious Zionism are [[Gush Emunim]], [[Tkuma (political party)|Tkuma]], and [[Meimad]]. [[Kahanism]], a radical branch of religious Zionism, was founded by Rabbi [[Meir Kahane]], whose party, [[Kach and Kahane Chai|Kach]], was eventually banned for [[racism]]. Today, [[Otzma Yehudit]] is the leading wing of this school of thought.\n\n== Educational institutions ==\n:''See: [[Yeshiva #Israel]]; [[:Category:Religious Zionist yeshivot]]; [[List of Midrashot]].''\n[[File:Mercaz HaRav01.JPG|thumb|[[Mercaz Harav]], Jerusalem]]\nThe flagship religious institution of the Religious Zionist movement is the [[yeshiva]] founded by Rabbi Abraham Isaac Kook in 1924, called in his honor \"[[Mercaz haRav]]\" (lit., the Rabbi's center). \nOther Religious Zionist yeshivot include [[Ateret Cohanim]], [[Beit El yeshiva]] and Yeshivat [[Or Etzion]], founded by Rav [[Haim Druckman]], a foremost disciple of Rabbi [[Tzvi Yehuda Kook]].\n\nThere are also approximately 90 ''[[Hesder]]'' yeshivot, allowing students to continue [[Torah study]] during their National Service (see [[#Military_service|below]]).\nThe first was [[Yeshivat Kerem B'Yavneh]], established in 1954; the largest is the [[Hesder Yeshiva of Sderot]] with over 800 students.\nOthers well known include [[Machon Meir|Yeshivat Machon Meir]], [[Yeshivat Har Etzion]], [[Yeshivat HaKotel]], [[Yeshivat Birkat Moshe]] in [[Maale Adumim]], [[Yeshiva Har Bracha|Yeshivat Har Bracha]] and Yeshivat Har Hamor.  \n\nThese institutions usually offer a [[kollel]] for ''[[Semikha]]'', or Rabbinic ordination. Students generally prepare for the ''Semikha'' test of the [[Chief Rabbinate of Israel]]; often for that of the [[posek]] R. [[Zalman Nechemia Goldberg]].\nTraining as a [[Dayan (rabbinic judge)]] in this community is usually through [[:he:\u05de\u05db\u05d5\u05df \u05d0\u05e8\u05d9\u05d0\u05dc|''Machon Ariel'']] (''[[Machon Harry Fischel]]''), also founded by Rav Kook, or [[:he:\u05d0\u05e8\u05e5_\u05d7\u05de\u05d3\u05d4_(\u05db\u05d5\u05dc\u05dc) |''Kollel Eretz Hemda'']].\n\nWomen study in institutions known as ''Midrashot'' (sing. [[Midrasha]]) - examples are [[Ein_HaNetziv#Education|Ein HaNatziv Women's Seminary]] and [[Migdal Oz (seminary)|Migdal Oz]]. Some also offer degree studies (and may then be known as a ''machon'').\n[[Nishmat (midrasha)|Nishmat]] trains women as [[Yoetzet Halacha|Yoatzot Halacha]]; see also [[Midreshet Lindenbaum]] and [[Matan Women's Institute for Torah Studies|Matan]], which similarly offer Talmud focused learning to women.\n\nHigh school students study at [[Education_in_Israel#Educational_tracks|''Mamlachti dati'']] schools, often associated with ''[[Bnei Akiva]]''. The first of these was at [[Kfar Haroeh]] established by [[Moshe-Zvi Neria]]. A girls' high school is referred to as an ''[[Ulpana]]''.\nFor degree studies, many attend [[Bar Ilan University]], which allows students to combine Yeshiva studies with university study; \n[[Jerusalem College of Technology]] similarly (which also offers a Haredi track).\nThere are also [[List_of_Israeli_universities_and_colleges#Colleges|several colleges of education]] associated with Hesder and the ''Midrashot'', such as [[Herzog College]] and the [[Lifshitz College of Education]]. These often allow specializations in [[Tanach]] and ''Machshava'' ([[Jewish thought]]).\n\nSome institutions are aligned with the ''[[Hardal]]'' (\u1e24aredi Le'umi) community, with an ideology that is somewhat more \"statist\".\nThe leading Yeshiva here is [[Har Hamor]]; [[Hardal#Schools|several high schools]] also operate.\n\n== Dress ==\nReligious Zionists are often called ''Kippot sruggot'', referring to the knitted or crocheted [[kippot|skullcaps]] (Hebrew ''kippa'', pl. ''kippot'') worn by many of the men. (However, there are also men who wear other types of headcoverings, such as ''kippot'' in black velvet.) \nTheir dress, otherwise, is largely the same as for secular Israelis.\nWomen usually wear skirts, and often cover their hair.\nSee under [[Tzniut]]: [[Tzniut#Dress|#Dress]] and [[Tzniut#Hair covering|#Hair covering]].\n\nIn the ''Hardal'' community, the dress is generally more formal, with an emphasis on appearing neat:  \nthe Kippot, also knitted, are significantly larger, and it is common for [[tzitzit]] to be worn visibly, as is the [[Haredi]] practice; \nwomen invariably cover their hair - usually with a [[snood]], or a ''mitpachat'' (Hebrew for \"kerchief\") - and often wear sandals.\n\nAt prayer, members of the community use the [[Koren Siddur]] or ''[[Rinat Yisrael]]''.\n\n== Politics ==\nMost Religious Zionists embrace [[right-wing]] politics, especially the religious right-wing [[Jewish Home]] party, but also support the mainstream right-wing [[Likud]]. There are also some left-wing Religious Zionists, such as Rabbi [[Michael Melchior]], whose views were represented by the [[Meimad]] party (which ran together with the [[Labor (Israel)|Israeli Labor party]]). Many Israeli [[Israeli settlements|settlers]] in the [[West Bank]] are Religious Zionists, along with most of the settlers forcibly expelled from the [[Gaza Strip]] in August and September 2005.\n\n== Military service ==\n{{unreferencedsect|date=November 2015}}\n[[File:IDF soldier put on tefillin.jpg|thumb|Second-Lieutenant [[From the Wilderness and Lebanon|Asael Lubotzky]], an [[Israel Defense Forces|IDF]] field commander during [[Second Lebanon War]], prays with [[Tefilin]]]]\nAll adult Jewish males in Israel are obligated to serve in the [[Israel Defense Forces|IDF]]. Certain segments of Orthodoxy defer their service in order to engage in full-time Torah study. Religious Zionist belief advocates that both are critical to Jewish survival and prosperity.\n\nFor this reason, many Religious Zionist men take part in the [[Hesder]] program, which allows military service to be combined with [[yeshiva]] studies. Some others attend a pre-army [[Mechina]] educational program, delaying their service by one year. 88% of Hesder students belong to combat units, compared to a national average of below 30%. \n\nWhile some Religious Zionist women serve in the army, most choose national service, known as [[Sherut Leumi]], instead (working at hospitals, schools, and day-care centers).\nIn November 2010, the IDF held a special conference which was attended by the heads of Religious Zionism in order to encourage female Religious Zionists to join the IDF.

The final was the showpiece match of English football's primary cup competition, the Football Association Challenge Cup ([[FA Cup]]), organised by the [[Football Association]]. Cardiff, one of the few Welsh teams taking part, won the match 1\u20130. Their victory remains the only occasion the trophy, which was previously known as the \"English Cup\", has been won by a non-English based team.\n\nThe teams entered the competition in the third round as members of the [[Football League First Division]] and progressed through five rounds to reach the final. In the fifth round, Cardiff knocked out the reigning champions, [[Bolton Wanderers F.C.|Bolton Wanderers]]. By the quarter-final stage, Arsenal and Cardiff were the only teams from the First Division remaining.\n\nOn the day of the final, additional trains were provided to transport Cardiff's fans to Wembley, and police reinforcements were deployed to keep at bay fans who had been sold fake tickets. A concert held before the game included a rendition of \"[[Abide with Me]]\"; singing this song before the match has since become a cup final tradition. For the first time, the final was broadcast on the radio by the [[BBC]]; some sources suggest this broadcast was the origin of the phrase \"[[wikt:back to square one|back to square one]]\", although the expression predates the match. There were more than 300,000 applications for tickets, and 91,206 were in attendance. A further 15,000 fans listened in Cardiff's [[Cathays Park]] to the radio broadcast.\n\nThe only goal of the game was credited to Cardiff's [[Hughie Ferguson]] after his shot slipped out of the hands of Arsenal goalkeeper [[Dan Lewis (footballer)|Dan Lewis]], who knocked the ball into the net with his elbow.

A [[direct free kick]] was given to Arsenal shortly afterwards, but the shot by Parker from {{convert|25|yd|m}} was saved by Farquharson for Cardiff.<ref name=\"final\" /> Combined play by Hulme and Buchan led to a corner, which then forced another three corners in a rapid succession. Arsenal could not capitalise on the opportunities and after the final corner the ball was shot a distance over the bar. The first half ended, Arsenal having dominated but the Cardiff City defence had stopped them each time.<ref name=\"yorkshirefinal\">{{cite news|title=The Association Cup|url=http://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/bl/0000687/19270425/149/0003|accessdate=6 April 2016|work=Yorkshire Post and Leeds Intelligencer|issue=24894|date=25 April 1927|page=3|url-access=subscription |via=[[British Newspaper Archive]]}}</ref> There was an incident in the crowd during the first half, at the 25th minute around 400 spectators outside the stadium rushed a gate being manned by four policemen.

Hulme drifted in a well placed cross, but nothing was made of it. Cardiff's then attacked: Curtis sent in a low shot which was saved by Lewis in the Arsenal goal. Shortly afterwards, Butler, the Arsenal midfielder, was struck hard in the face by the ball causing a brief delay to play. The game resumed, and McLachlan attacked down the wing for Cardiff; he passed to Davies whose shot went just wide of the post. Buchan attempted to return the advantage to Arsenal with a long pass to the left wing for Hoar, but Cardiff City's Jimmy Nelson covered the move. City's attacking continued, and a shot from Hardy appeared to shake Lewis in goal as he did not gather the ball cleanly.<ref name=\"yorkshirefinal\"/>\n\nThe only goal of the game followed shortly thereafter. Curtis went on a run for Cardiff before passing it forward near the box to Ferguson. He shot the ball towards the goal, but it had little power and was easily picked up by Lewis. As he did so, the ball squirmed out of Lewis' hands and slipped in between the crook of his left elbow and body. With Cardiff forwards closing in, Lewis tried to reclaim the ball but only succeeded in knocking it into the net with his elbow. Arsenal sought to attack immediately after the kick off, but the move faltered when Brain was caught offside. Cardiff countered, and possibly could have had a second goal, but Curtis chose to shoot himself rather than pass to Davies, who would have been presented with an open goal as Lewis was out of position. The match ended with a victory for Cardiff City by one goal to nil.<ref name=\"yorkshirefinal\"/> The King presented the trophy to Cardiff's captain Keenor, and medals to each of the players from both teams.<ref name=kingsees/>\n\n===Details===\n{{football box\n|date=23 April 1927\n|time=15:00 [[Western European Summer Time|BST]]\n|team1=[[Cardiff City F.C.|Cardiff City]] {{flagicon|Wales|1807}}\n|score=1\u20130\n|team2={{flagicon|England}} [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]]\n|goals1=[[Hughie Ferguson|Ferguson]] {{goal|74}}\n|goals2=\n|stadium=[[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley Stadium]], [[London]]\n|attendance=91,206<ref>{{cite book |url=https://archive.org/details/rothmansfootball00roll/page/451 |url-access=registration |title=Rothmans Football Yearbook 1980\u201381 |editor-first=Jack |editor-last=Rollin |publisher=[[Queen Anne Press]]|location=London |year=1980 |isbn=0362020175 |p=451.}}</ref>\n|referee= William F.

The final was the showpiece match of English football's primary cup competition, the Football Association Challenge Cup ([[FA Cup]]), organised by the [[Football Association]]. Cardiff, one of the few Welsh teams taking part, won the match 1\u20130. Their victory remains the only occasion the trophy, which was previously known as the \"English Cup\", has been won by a non-English based team.\n\nThe teams entered the competition in the third round as members of the [[Football League First Division]] and progressed through five rounds to reach the final. In the fifth round, Cardiff knocked out the reigning champions, [[Bolton Wanderers F.C.|Bolton Wanderers]]. By the quarter-final stage, Arsenal and Cardiff were the only teams from the First Division remaining.\n\nOn the day of the final, additional trains were provided to transport Cardiff's fans to Wembley, and police reinforcements were deployed to keep at bay fans who had been sold fake tickets. A concert held before the game included a rendition of \"[[Abide with Me]]\"; singing this song before the match has since become a cup final tradition. For the first time, the final was broadcast on the radio by the [[BBC]]; some sources suggest this broadcast was the origin of the phrase \"[[wikt:back to square one|back to square one]]\", although the expression predates the match. There were more than 300,000 applications for tickets, and 91,206 were in attendance. A further 15,000 fans listened in Cardiff's [[Cathays Park]] to the radio broadcast.\n\nThe only goal of the game was credited to Cardiff's [[Hughie Ferguson]] after his shot slipped out of the hands of Arsenal goalkeeper [[Dan Lewis (footballer)|Dan Lewis]], who knocked the ball into the net with his elbow. Lewis later blamed his new woollen jersey, saying that it was greasy. This inspired the Arsenal tradition of washing goalkeeper jerseys before every match.

A [[direct free kick]] was given to Arsenal shortly afterwards, but the shot by Parker from {{convert|25|yd|m}} was saved by Farquharson for Cardiff.<ref name=\"final\" /> Combined play by Hulme and Buchan led to a corner, which then forced another three corners in a rapid succession. Arsenal could not capitalise on the opportunities and after the final corner the ball was shot a distance over the bar.

Hulme drifted in a well placed cross, but nothing was made of it. Cardiff's then attacked: Curtis sent in a low shot which was saved by Lewis in the Arsenal goal. Shortly afterwards, Butler, the Arsenal midfielder, was struck hard in the face by the ball causing a brief delay to play. The game resumed, and McLachlan attacked down the wing for Cardiff; he passed to Davies whose shot went just wide of the post. Buchan attempted to return the advantage to Arsenal with a long pass to the left wing for Hoar, but Cardiff City's Jimmy Nelson covered the move. City's attacking continued, and a shot from Hardy appeared to shake Lewis in goal as he did not gather the ball cleanly.<ref name=\"yorkshirefinal\"/>\n\nThe only goal of the game followed shortly thereafter. Curtis went on a run for Cardiff before passing it forward near the box to Ferguson. He shot the ball towards the goal, but it had little power and was easily picked up by Lewis. As he did so, the ball squirmed out of Lewis' hands and slipped in between the crook of his left elbow and body. With Cardiff forwards closing in, Lewis tried to reclaim the ball but only succeeded in knocking it into the net with his elbow. Arsenal sought to attack immediately after the kick off, but the move faltered when Brain was caught offside. Cardiff countered, and possibly could have had a second goal, but Curtis chose to shoot himself rather than pass to Davies, who would have been presented with an open goal as Lewis was out of position. The match ended with a victory for Cardiff City by one goal to nil.<ref name=\"yorkshirefinal\"/> The King presented the trophy to Cardiff's captain Keenor, and medals to each of the players from both teams.<ref name=kingsees/>\n\n===Details===\n{{football box\n|date=23 April 1927\n|time=15:00 [[Western European Summer Time|BST]]\n|team1=[[Cardiff City F.C.|Cardiff City]] {{flagicon|Wales|1807}}\n|score=1\u20130\n|team2={{flagicon|England}} [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]]\n|goals1=[[Hughie Ferguson|Ferguson]] {{goal|74}}\n|goals2=\n|stadium=[[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley Stadium]], [[London]]\n|attendance=91,206<ref>{{cite book |url=https://archive.org/details/rothmansfootball00roll/page/451 |url-access=registration |title=Rothmans Football Yearbook 1980\u201381 |editor-first=Jack |editor-last=Rollin |publisher=[[Queen Anne Press]]|location=London |year=1980 |isbn=0362020175 |p=451.}}</ref>\n|referee= William F.

Ballesteros by this time had an extremely poor reputation for [[gamesmanship]]. After noise was coincidentally made during swings made by the United States Team on the first 2 holes, Floyd approached Ballesteros with a severe warning that he was \"better than you (Ballesteros) could ever be at this\" and that if he did not stop he would reciprocate with force. <ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=507562393155217 |title= Ray Floyd shuts down Seve |publisher=Golf Channel |accessdate=April 22, 2020}}</ref>\n\nSince the mid-1980s, the European team had dominated the event including wins in 1985, 1987 and retaining the cup in 1989.

Ballesteros by this time had an extremely poor reputation for [[gamesmanship]]. After noise was coincidentally made during swings made by the United States Team on the first 2 holes, Floyd approached Ballesteros with a severe warning that he was \"better than you (Ballesteros) could ever be at this\" and that if he did not stop he would reciprocate with force. <ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=507562393155217 |title= Ray Floyd shuts down Seve |publisher=Golf Channel |accessdate=April 22, 2020}}</ref>\n\nSince the mid-1980s, the European team had dominated the event including wins in 1985, 1987 and retaining the cup in 1989.

By 1819, there were 244 settlers, and by 1861 the population had risen to 4,901, many of whom were descendants of [[United Empire Loyalists]], veterans of the [[War of 1812]] who had been granted land there, or the original and later settlers from Ireland.

The commercial businesses and services (banking, government) are found along King Street and County Road 10. County Road 10 provides Millbrook with convenient connections with [[Ontario Highway 115]] and [[Ontario Highway 401]].\n\nIt has been a filming location for several movie productions. ''[[Anne with an E]]'' (a 2017 CBC production), ''[[Sunshine Sketches of a Little Town]]''  (a 2011 CBC production), ''[[The Music Man (2003 film)|The Music Man]]'', ''[[Ice Princess]]'', ''The Town Christmas Forgot'' and ''[[A History of Violence (film)|A History of Violence]]'' were filmed in the town. In the latter film, Millbrook was depicted as the fictional town of Millbrook, [[Indiana]].\n\nThe [[political cartoonist]] [[Sam Hunter (cartoonist)|Sam Hunter]] was born and raised in Millbrook, along with award-winning filmmaker Jared Raab, esteemed Aquatic Science Biologist Dustin Raab with Fisheries and Oceans Canada, and [[Juno Award]] winner singer/songwriter [[Serena Ryder]].\n\n==Economy==\n\nCavan is home to Alltech's corn feed facility under the Masterfeeds brand. It was formerly owned by [[Maple Leaf Foods]] which opened a feed facility on [[List of numbered roads in Peterborough County|Peterborough County Road 10]] just north of [[Ontario Highway 35]]. Opened in 1975 the facility was then owned by Maple Leaf Mills, which relocated from the [[Maple Leaf Mills Silos]] in downtown

The commercial businesses and services (banking, government) are found along King Street and County Road 10. County Road 10 provides Millbrook with convenient connections with [[Ontario Highway 115]] and [[Ontario Highway 401]].\n\nIt has been a filming location for several movie productions. ''[[Anne with an E]]'' (a 2017 CBC production), ''[[Sunshine Sketches of a Little Town]]''  (a 2011 CBC production), ''[[The Music Man (2003 film)|The Music Man]]'', ''[[Ice Princess]]'', ''The Town Christmas Forgot'' and ''[[A History of Violence (film)|A History of Violence]]'' were filmed in the town. In the latter film, Millbrook was depicted as the fictional town of Millbrook, [[Indiana]].\n\nThe [[political cartoonist]] [[Sam Hunter (cartoonist)|Sam Hunter]] was born and raised in Millbrook, along with award-winning filmmaker Jared Raab, esteemed Aquatic Science Biologist Dustin Raab with Fisheries and Oceans Canada, and [[Juno Award]] winner singer/songwriter [[Serena Ryder]].\n\n==Economy==\n\nCavan is home to Alltech's corn feed facility under the Masterfeeds brand. It was formerly owned by [[Maple Leaf Foods]] which opened a feed facility on [[List of numbered roads in Peterborough County|Peterborough County Road 10]] just north of [[Ontario Highway 35]]. Opened in 1975 the facility was then owned by '''Maple Leaf Mills''', which relocated from the [[Maple Leaf Mills Silos]] in downtown [[Toronto]].<ref>http://images.ourontario.ca/Partners/ClaPL/CLaPL002842929pf_0018.pdf</ref>\n\n==Demographics==\n{{Historical populations\n|title       = Cavan Monaghan historical populations\n|type        = Canada\n|align       = right\n|percentages = \n|footnote    =<ref>Statistics Canada: [[Canada 2001 Census|2001]], [[Canada 2006 Census|2006]]</ref><ref name=\"cp2011a\"/><ref name=\"census2016\"/>\n|[[Canada 2001 Census|2001]]| 8453\n|[[Canada 2006 Census|2006]]| 8828\n|[[Canada 2011 Census|2011]]| 8601\n|[[Canada 2016 Census|2016]]| 8829\n}}\n{{Canada census\n |2016_population=8,829 | 2016_pop_delta=+2.7 | 2016_land_area=306.33 | 2016_pop_density=28.8\n |2016_median_age=46.1 | 2016_median_age_m=45.6 | 2016_median_age_f=46.6\n |2016_total_pvt_dwell=3,271 | 2016_mean_hh_income=90,957 | 2016_access_date=2019-06-30\n |2011_population=8,601 | 2011_pop_delta=-2.6 | 2011_land_area=306.22 | 2011_pop_density=28.1\n |2011_median_age= | 2011_median_age_m= | 2011_median_age_f=\n |2011_total_pvt_dwell=3,221 | 2011_mean_hh_income= | 2011_access_date=2012-03-09\n |2006_population=8,828 | 2006_pop_delta=4.4 | 2006_land_area=306.13 | 2006_pop_density=28.8\n |2006_median_age=42.5 | 2006_median_age_m=42.3 | 2006_median_age_f=42.7\n |2006_total_pvt_dwell=3,088 | 2006_mean_hh_income=73,654 | 2006_access_date=2012-03-09\n |2001_population=8,453 | 2001_pop_delta=2.4 | 2001_land_area=306.13 | 2001_pop_density=27.6\n |2001_median_age=39.1 | 2001_median_age_m=38.7 | 2001_median_age_f=39.5\n |2001_total_pvt_dwell=2,951 | 2001_mean_hh_income=59,950 | 2001_access_date=2012-03-09\n}}\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of townships in Ontario]]\n*[[List of correctional facilities in Ontario]] [[Vehicle registration plates of Ontario|Ontario Licence Plates]] were made at the Millbrook Correctional Centre, 1974-2003.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|refs=\n<ref name=\"cp2011a\">{{cite web |url=http://www12.statcan.ca/census-recensement/2011/dp-pd/prof/details/page.cfm?Lang=E&Geo1=CSD&Code1=3515013&Geo2=CD&Code2=3515&Data=Count&SearchText=Cavan&SearchType=Begins&SearchPR=01&B1=All&Custom=&TABID=1 |title=Cavan Monaghan census profile |publisher=Statistics Canada |work=[[Canada 2011 Census|2011 Census of Population]] |accessdate=2012-03-09}}</ref>\n}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.cavanmonaghan.net/siteengine/activepage.asp Township of Cavan-Monaghan]\n\n{{Geographic location\n | Centre    = Cavan Monaghan\n | North     = [[Kawartha Lakes]]\n | Northeast = [[Selwyn, Ontario|Selwyn]]\n | East      = [[Peterborough, Ontario|Peterborough]]<br>[[Otonabee\u2013South Monaghan]]\n | Southeast = [[Hamilton, Ontario (township)|Hamilton Township]]\n | South     = [[Port Hope, Ontario|Port Hope]]\n | Southwest = [[Clarington]]\n | West      = [[Kawartha Lakes]]\n | Northwest = \n}}\n\n{{Peterborough County}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Cavan Monaghan}}\n[[Category:Lower-tier municipalities in Ontario]]\n[[Category:Municipalities in Peterborough County]]\n[[Category:Township municipalities in Ontario]]\n", "name_user": "InedibleHulk", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eEconomy:Not THAT impressive.", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cavan_Monaghan"}

{"title_page": "Technology acceptance model", "text_new": "[[File:Technology Acceptance Model.png|250px|thumb|The Technology Acceptance Model, version 1. ({{harvnb|Davis|Bagozzi|Warshaw|1989}})]]\n\nThe '''technology acceptance model''' ('''TAM''') is an [[information systems]] theory that models how users come to accept and use a technology.  \n\nThe '''actual system use''' is the end-point where we want everyone to be able to do with technology, so we have to form '''Behavioral Intention''', which is a factor that leads people to use the technology. The behavioral intention (BI) is influenced by the '''attitude''' (A) which is the general impression of the technology.\n\nThe model suggests that when users are presented with a new technology, a number of factors influence their decision about how and when they will use it, notably:\n\n*'''Perceived usefulness''' (PU) \u2013 This was defined by Fred Davis as \"the degree to which a person believes that using a particular system would enhance his or her [[job performance]]\". It means whether or not someone perceives that technology to be useful for what they want to do.\n*'''Perceived ease-of-use''' (PEOU) \u2013 Davis defined this as \"the degree to which a person believes that using a particular system would be free from effort\" ({{harvnb|Davis|1989}}). If the technology is easy to use, then the barriers conquered. If it's not easy to use and the interface is complicated, no one has a positive attitudes towards it.\n\n'''External variables''' such as social influence is an important factor to determine the attitude. When these things (TAM) are in place, people will have the attitude and intention to use the technology.However, the perception may change depending on age and gender because everyone is different.\n\nThe TAM has been continuously studied and expanded\u2014the two major upgrades being the TAM 2 ({{harvnb|Venkatesh|Davis|2000}} & {{harvnb|Venkatesh|2000}}) and the [[Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology]] (or [[UTAUT]], {{harvnb|Venkatesh|Morris|Davis|Davis|2003}}). A TAM 3 has also been proposed in the context of [[e-commerce]] with an inclusion of the effects of trust and perceived risk on system use ({{harvnb|Venkatesh|Bala|2008}}).\n\n==Background==\n\nTAM is one of the most influential extensions of Ajzen and Fishbein's [[theory of reasoned action]] (TRA) in the literature. Davis's technology acceptance model (Davis, 1989; Davis, Bagozzi, & Warshaw, 1989)\nis the most widely applied model of users' acceptance and usage of technology\n(Venkatesh, 2000). It was developed by Fred Davis and [[Richard Bagozzi]] ({{harvnb|Davis|1989}}, {{harvnb|Bagozzi|Davis|Warshaw|1992}}<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Muhammad Sharif Abbasi|last2=Ali Tarhini|last3=Tariq Elyas|last4=Farwa Shah|date=2015-10-09|title=Impact of individualism and collectivism over the individual's technology acceptance behaviour: A multi-group analysis between Pakistan and Turkey|journal=Journal of Enterprise Information Management|volume=28|issue=6|pages=747\u2013768|doi=10.1108/JEIM-12-2014-0124|issn=1741-0398}}</ref>). TAM replaces many of TRA's attitude measures with the two technology acceptance measures&mdash;''ease of use'', and ''usefulness''. TRA and TAM, both of which have strong behavioural elements, assume that when someone forms an intention to act, that they will be free to act without limitation. In the real world there will be many constraints, such as limited freedom to act ({{harvnb|Bagozzi|Davis|Warshaw|1992}}).\n\nBagozzi, Davis and Warshaw say:\n\n:''Because new technologies such as personal computers are complex and an element of uncertainty exists in the minds of decision makers with respect to the successful adoption of them, people form attitudes and intentions toward trying to learn to use the new technology prior to initiating efforts directed at using. Attitudes towards usage and intentions to use may be ill-formed or lacking in conviction or else may occur only after preliminary strivings to learn to use the technology evolve. Thus, actual usage may not be a direct or immediate consequence of such attitudes and intentions.'' ({{harvnb|Bagozzi|Davis|Warshaw|1992}})\n\nEarlier research on the [[diffusion of innovations]] also suggested a prominent role for perceived ease of use. Tornatzky and Klein ({{harvnb|Tornatzky|Klein|1982}}) analysed the adoption, finding that compatibility, relative advantage, and complexity had the most significant relationships with adoption across a broad range of innovation types. Eason studied perceived usefulness in terms of a fit between systems, tasks and job profiles, using the terms \"task fit\" to describe the metric (quoted in {{harvnb|Stewart|1986}})  {{harvnb|Legris|Ingham|Collerette|2003}} suggest that TAM must be extended to include variables that account for change processes and that this could be achieved through adoption of the innovation model into TAM.\n\n==Usage==\nSeveral researchers have replicated Davis's original study ({{harvnb|Davis|1989}}) to provide empirical evidence on the relationships that exist between usefulness, ease of use and system use ({{harvnb|Adams|Nelson|Todd|1992}}; {{harvnb|Davis|1989}}; {{harvnb|Hendrickson|Massey|Cronan|1993}}; {{harvnb|Segars|Grover|1993}}; {{harvnb|Subramanian|1994}}; {{harvnb|Szajna|1994}}). Much attention has focused on testing the robustness and validity of the questionnaire instrument used by Davis. Adams et al. ({{harvnb|Adams|1992}}) replicated the work of Davis ({{harvnb|Davis|1989}}) to demonstrate the validity and reliability of his instrument and his measurement scales. They also extended it to different settings and, using two different samples, they demonstrated the internal consistency and replication reliability of the two scales. Hendrickson et al. ({{harvnb|Hendrickson|Massey|Cronan|1993}}) found high reliability and good test-retest reliability. Szajna ({{harvnb|Szajna|1994}}) found that the instrument had predictive validity for intent to use, self-reported usage and attitude toward use. The sum of this research has confirmed the validity of the Davis instrument, and to support its use with different populations of users and different software choices.\n\nSegars and Grover ({{harvnb|Segars|Grover|1993}}) re-examined Adams et al.'s ({{harvnb|Adams|Nelson|Todd|1992}}) replication of the Davis work. They were critical of the measurement model used, and postulated a different model based on three constructs: usefulness, effectiveness, and ease-of-use. These findings do not yet seem to have been replicated. However, some aspects of these findings were tested and supported by Workman ({{harvnb|Workman|2007}}) by separating the dependent variable into information use versus technology use.\n\nMark Keil and his colleagues have developed (or, perhaps rendered more popularisable) Davis's model into what they call the Usefulness/[[EOU Grid]], which is a 2\u00d72 grid where each quadrant represents a different combination of the two attributes. In the context of software use, this provides a mechanism for discussing the current mix of usefulness and EOU for particular software packages, and for plotting a different course if a different mix is desired, such as the introduction of even more powerful software ({{harvnb|Keil|Beranek|Konsynski|1995}}).\nThe TAM model has been used in most technological and geographic contexts. One of these contexts is health care, which is growing rapidly <ref>{{cite journal|last1=Rahimi |first1=Bahlol |first2=Hamed |last2=Nadri |last3=Lotf nezhad afshar|first3 =Hadi|first4=Toomas|last4=Timpka|title=A Systematic Review of the Technology Acceptance Model in Health Informatics|journal=Applied Clinical Informatics |volume=09|issue=3|pages=604\u2013634 |date=2018|doi=10.1055/s-0038-1668091 |pmid=30112741|pmc=6094026 }}</ref>\n\nVenkatesh and Davis extended the original TAM model to explain perceived usefulness and usage intentions in terms of social influence (subjective norms, voluntariness, image) and cognitive instrumental processes (job relevance, output quality, result demonstrability, perceived ease of use). The extended model, referred to as TAM2, was tested in both voluntary and mandatory settings. The results strongly supported TAM2 ({{harvnb|Venkatesh|Davis|2000}}).\n\n* '''Subjective norm''' \u2013 An individual's perception that other individuals who are important to him/she consider if he/she could perform a behavior. This was consistent with the [[theory of reasoned action]] (TRA).\n* '''Voluntariness''' \u2013 This was defined by Venkatesh & Davis as \"extent to which potential adopters perceive the adoption decision to be non-mandatory\" ({{Harvnb|Venkatesh|Davis|2000}}).\n* '''Image''' \u2013 This was defined by Moore & Benbasat as \"the degree to which use of an innovation perceived to enhance one's status in one's social system\" ({{Harvnb|Moore|Benbasat|1991}}<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Moore|first=Gary C.|last2=Benbasat|first2=Izak|date=1991-09-01|title=Development of an Instrument to Measure the Perceptions of Adopting an Information Technology Innovation|journal=Information Systems Research|volume=2|issue=3|pages=192\u2013222|doi=10.1287/isre.2.3.192|issn=1047-7047}}</ref>).\n* '''Job relevance''' \u2013 Venkatesh & Davis defined this as personal perspective on the extent to which the target system is suitable for the job ({{Harvnb|Venkatesh|Davis|2000}}).\n* '''Output quality''' \u2013 Venkatesh & Davis defined this as personal perception of the system's ability to perform specific tasks ({{Harvnb|Venkatesh|Davis|2000}}).\n* '''Result demonstrability''' \u2013 The production of tangible results will directly influence the system's usefulness ({{Harnvb|Moore|Benbasat|1991}}).\n\nIn an attempt to integrate the main competing user acceptance models, Venkatesh et al. formulated the [[unified theory of acceptance and use of technology]] (UTAUT). This model was found to outperform each of the individual models (Adjusted R square of 69 percent) ({{harvnb|Venkatesh|Morris|Davis|Davis|2003}}). UTAUT has been adopted by some recent studies in healthcare.<ref name=hf2010>{{Cite journal \n| last1 = Huser | first1 = V. \n| last2 = Narus | first2 = S. P. \n| last3 = Rocha | first3 = R.

The MPT model is fully described in her 1993 text ({{harvnb|Scherer|2005}}, 1st ed. 1993), \"Living in the State of Stuck\", now in its 4th edition. The MPT model has accompanying assessment measures used in technology selection and decision-making, as well as outcomes research on differences among technology users, non-users, avoiders, and reluctant users.\n# The [[HMSAM]]: TAM has been effective for explaining many kinds of systems use (i.e. [[e-learning]], [[learning management system]]s, [[webportal]]s, etc.) (Fathema, Sutton, 2013, Fathema, Shannon, Ross, 2015, Fathema, Ross, Witte, 2014). However, TAM is not ideally suited to explain adoption of purely intrinsic or hedonic systems (e.g., online games, music, learning for pleasure). Thus, an alternative model to TAM, called the hedonic-motivation system adoption model (HMSAM) was proposed for these kinds of systems by Lowry et al. ({{harvnb|Lowry|Gaskin|Twyman|Hammer|Roberts|2013}}). HMSAM is designed to improve the understanding of hedonic-motivation systems (HMS) adoption. HMS are systems used primarily to fulfill users' intrinsic motivations, such for online gaming, virtual worlds, online shopping, learning/education, online dating, digital music repositories, social networking, only pornography, gamified systems, and for general [[gamification]]. Instead of a minor TAM extension, HMSAM is an HMS-specific system acceptance model based on an alternative theoretical perspective, which is in turn grounded in flow-based cognitive absorption (CA). HMSAM may be especially useful in understanding gamification elements of systems use.\n# '''Extended TAM''': Several studies proposed extension of original TAM (Davis, 1989) by adding external variables in it with an aim of exploring the effects of external factors on users' attitude, behavioral intention and actual use of technology. Several factors have been examined  so far. For example, perceived self-efficacy, facilitating conditions, and systems quality  (Fathema, Shannon, Ross, 2015, Fathema, Ross, Witte, 2014). This model has also been applied in the acceptance of health care technologies.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Nadri |first1=Hamed |first2=Bahlol |last2=Rahimi |last3=Lotf nezhad afshar|first3 =Hadi|first4=Mahnaz|last4=Samadbeik|last5 =Garavand|first5 =Ali|title=Factors Affecting Acceptance of Hospital Information Systems Based on Extended Technology Acceptance Model: A Case Study in Three Paraclinical Departments\n|journal=Applied Clinical Informatics |volume=09|issue=2|pages=238\u2013247 |date=2018|doi=10.1055/s-0038-1641595 |pmid=29618139|pmc=5884692 }}</ref>\n\n==Criticisms==\nTAM has been widely criticised, despite its frequent use, leading the original proposers to attempt to redefine it several times. Criticisms of TAM as a \"theory\" include its questionable heuristic value, limited explanatory and predictive power, triviality, and lack of any practical value ({{harvnb|Chuttur|2009}}). [[Izak Benbasat|Benbasat]] and [[Henri Barki|Barki]] suggest that TAM \"has diverted researchers' attention away from other \nimportant research issues and has created an illusion of progress in knowledge accumulation. Furthermore, the \nindependent attempts by several researchers to expand TAM in order to adapt it to the constantly changing IT environments has lead{{sic}} to a state of theoretical chaos and confusion\" ({{harvnb|Benbasat|Barki|2007}}). In general, TAM focuses on the individual  'user' of a computer, with the concept of 'perceived usefulness', with extension to bring in more and more factors to explain how a user 'perceives' 'usefulness', and ignores the essentially social processes of IS development and implementation, without question where more technology is actually better, and the social consequences of IS use. Lunceford argues that the framework of perceived usefulness and ease of use overlooks other issues, such as cost and structural imperatives that force users into adopting the technology.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Lunceford|first=Brett|date=2009|title=Reconsidering Technology Adoption and Resistance: Observations of a Semi-Luddite|url=https://www.academia.edu/510375|journal=Explorations in Media Ecology|volume=8|issue=1|pages=29\u201347|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}</ref> For a recent analysis and critique of TAM, see Bagozzi ({{harvnb|Bagozzi|2007}}).\n\nLegris et al.<ref>Legris et al. 2003, p. 191.</ref> claim that, together, TAM and TAM2 account for only 40% of a technological system's use.\n\nBased on more fundamental models, Li <ref name=\"Li2020\">Li, Jerry  (2020), Blockchain technology adoption: Examining the Fundamental Drivers, ''Conference Proceedings, 2020 International Conference on Management Science and Industrial Engineering'',  https://doi.org/10.13140/RG.2.2.30288.25602 (accepted version)</ref> demonstrated that better predictive power can be achieved by proper initial screening.

Li <ref name=\"Li2020\"/> also reported similar observations when investigating the adoption of Blockchain technology.\n\nA study conducted by Okafor, D. J., Nico, M. & Azman, B. B. (2016) discovered that perceived ease of use doesn't have any influence on the adoption of multimedia online technologies for Malaysian SMEs. The answers from the participants in this study suggest that, for them, perceived ease of use was not indicative of their behavioural intention to adopt multimedia online technologies (MOT) in the future. Instead of not adopting MOT, if they are complicated some participants said they are willing to learn it or practice more.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Diffusion (business)|Diffusion]]\n* [[Diffusion of innovations]]\n* [[Domestication theory]]\n* [[Lazy user model]]\n* [[List of marketing topics]]\n* [[New product development]]\n* [[Product life cycle management]]\n* [[Research and development]]\n* [[Technology adoption lifecycle]]\n* [[Technology lifecycle]]\n* [[Theory of planned behavior]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n* {{citation|last1=Adams|first1=D.

({{harvnb|Davis|Bagozzi|Warshaw|1989}})]]\n\nThe '''technology acceptance model''' ('''TAM''') is an [[information systems]] theory that models how users come to accept and use a technology.  \n\nThe '''actual system use''' is the end-point where we want everyone to be able to do with technology, so we have to form '''Behavioral Intention''', which is a factor that leads people to use the technology. The behavioral intention (BI) is influenced by the '''attitude''' (A) which is the general impression of the technology.\n\nThe model suggests that when users are presented with a new technology, a number of factors influence their decision about how and when they will use it, notably:\n\n*'''Perceived usefulness''' (PU) \u2013 This was defined by Fred Davis as \"the degree to which a person believes that using a particular system would enhance his or her [[job performance]]\". It means whether or not someone perceives that technology to be useful for what they want to do.\n*'''Perceived ease-of-use''' (PEOU) \u2013 Davis defined this as \"the degree to which a person believes that using a particular system would be free from effort\" ({{harvnb|Davis|1989}}). If the technology is easy to use, then the barriers conquered. If it's not easy to use and the interface is complicated, no one has a positive attitudes towards it.\n\n'''External variables''' such as social influence is an important factor to determine the attitude. When these things (TAM) are in place, people will have the attitude and intention to use the technology.However, the perception may change depending on age and gender because everyone is different.\n\nThe TAM has been continuously studied and expanded\u2014the two major upgrades being the TAM 2 ({{harvnb|Venkatesh|Davis|2000}} & {{harvnb|Venkatesh|2000}}) and the [[Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology]] (or [[UTAUT]], {{harvnb|Venkatesh|Morris|Davis|Davis|2003}}). A TAM 3 has also been proposed in the context of [[e-commerce]] with an inclusion of the effects of trust and perceived risk on system use ({{harvnb|Venkatesh|Bala|2008}}).\n\n==Background==\n\nTAM is one of the most influential extensions of Ajzen and Fishbein's [[theory of reasoned action]] (TRA) in the literature. Davis's technology acceptance model (Davis, 1989; Davis, Bagozzi, & Warshaw, 1989)\nis the most widely applied model of users' acceptance and usage of technology\n(Venkatesh, 2000). It was developed by Fred Davis and [[Richard Bagozzi]] ({{harvnb|Davis|1989}}, {{harvnb|Bagozzi|Davis|Warshaw|1992}}<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Muhammad Sharif Abbasi|last2=Ali Tarhini|last3=Tariq Elyas|last4=Farwa Shah|date=2015-10-09|title=Impact of individualism and collectivism over the individual's technology acceptance behaviour: A multi-group analysis between Pakistan and Turkey|journal=Journal of Enterprise Information Management|volume=28|issue=6|pages=747\u2013768|doi=10.1108/JEIM-12-2014-0124|issn=1741-0398}}</ref>). TAM replaces many of TRA's attitude measures with the two technology acceptance measures&mdash;''ease of use'', and ''usefulness''. TRA and TAM, both of which have strong behavioural elements, assume that when someone forms an intention to act, that they will be free to act without limitation. In the real world there will be many constraints, such as limited freedom to act ({{harvnb|Bagozzi|Davis|Warshaw|1992}}).\n\nBagozzi, Davis and Warshaw say:\n\n:''Because new technologies such as personal computers are complex and an element of uncertainty exists in the minds of decision makers with respect to the successful adoption of them, people form attitudes and intentions toward trying to learn to use the new technology prior to initiating efforts directed at using. Attitudes towards usage and intentions to use may be ill-formed or lacking in conviction or else may occur only after preliminary strivings to learn to use the technology evolve. Thus, actual usage may not be a direct or immediate consequence of such attitudes and intentions.'' ({{harvnb|Bagozzi|Davis|Warshaw|1992}})\n\nEarlier research on the [[diffusion of innovations]] also suggested a prominent role for perceived ease of use. Tornatzky and Klein ({{harvnb|Tornatzky|Klein|1982}}) analysed the adoption, finding that compatibility, relative advantage, and complexity had the most significant relationships with adoption across a broad range of innovation types. Eason studied perceived usefulness in terms of a fit between systems, tasks and job profiles, using the terms \"task fit\" to describe the metric (quoted in {{harvnb|Stewart|1986}})  {{harvnb|Legris|Ingham|Collerette|2003}} suggest that TAM must be extended to include variables that account for change processes and that this could be achieved through adoption of the innovation model into TAM.\n\n==Usage==\nSeveral researchers have replicated Davis's original study ({{harvnb|Davis|1989}}) to provide empirical evidence on the relationships that exist between usefulness, ease of use and system use ({{harvnb|Adams|Nelson|Todd|1992}}; {{harvnb|Davis|1989}}; {{harvnb|Hendrickson|Massey|Cronan|1993}}; {{harvnb|Segars|Grover|1993}}; {{harvnb|Subramanian|1994}}; {{harvnb|Szajna|1994}}). Much attention has focused on testing the robustness and validity of the questionnaire instrument used by Davis. Adams et al. ({{harvnb|Adams|1992}}) replicated the work of Davis ({{harvnb|Davis|1989}}) to demonstrate the validity and reliability of his instrument and his measurement scales. They also extended it to different settings and, using two different samples, they demonstrated the internal consistency and replication reliability of the two scales. Hendrickson et al. ({{harvnb|Hendrickson|Massey|Cronan|1993}}) found high reliability and good test-retest reliability. Szajna ({{harvnb|Szajna|1994}}) found that the instrument had predictive validity for intent to use, self-reported usage and attitude toward use. The sum of this research has confirmed the validity of the Davis instrument, and to support its use with different populations of users and different software choices.\n\nSegars and Grover ({{harvnb|Segars|Grover|1993}}) re-examined Adams et al.'s ({{harvnb|Adams|Nelson|Todd|1992}}) replication of the Davis work. They were critical of the measurement model used, and postulated a different model based on three constructs: usefulness, effectiveness, and ease-of-use. These findings do not yet seem to have been replicated. However, some aspects of these findings were tested and supported by Workman ({{harvnb|Workman|2007}}) by separating the dependent variable into information use versus technology use.\n\nMark Keil and his colleagues have developed (or, perhaps rendered more popularisable) Davis's model into what they call the Usefulness/[[EOU Grid]], which is a 2\u00d72 grid where each quadrant represents a different combination of the two attributes. In the context of software use, this provides a mechanism for discussing the current mix of usefulness and EOU for particular software packages, and for plotting a different course if a different mix is desired, such as the introduction of even more powerful software ({{harvnb|Keil|Beranek|Konsynski|1995}}).\nThe TAM model has been used in most technological and geographic contexts. One of these contexts is health care, which is growing rapidly <ref>{{cite journal|last1=Rahimi |first1=Bahlol |first2=Hamed |last2=Nadri |last3=Lotf nezhad afshar|first3 =Hadi|first4=Toomas|last4=Timpka|title=A Systematic Review of the Technology Acceptance Model in Health Informatics|journal=Applied Clinical Informatics |volume=09|issue=3|pages=604\u2013634 |date=2018|doi=10.1055/s-0038-1668091 |pmid=30112741|pmc=6094026 }}</ref>\n\nVenkatesh and Davis extended the original TAM model to explain perceived usefulness and usage intentions in terms of social influence (subjective norms, voluntariness, image) and cognitive instrumental processes (job relevance, output quality, result demonstrability, perceived ease of use). The extended model, referred to as TAM2, was tested in both voluntary and mandatory settings. The results strongly supported TAM2 ({{harvnb|Venkatesh|Davis|2000}}).\n\n* '''Subjective norm''' \u2013 An individual's perception that other individuals who are important to him/she consider if he/she could perform a behavior. This was consistent with the [[theory of reasoned action]] (TRA).\n* '''Voluntariness''' \u2013 This was defined by Venkatesh & Davis as \"extent to which potential adopters perceive the adoption decision to be non-mandatory\" ({{Harvnb|Venkatesh|Davis|2000}}).\n* '''Image''' \u2013 This was defined by Moore & Benbasat as \"the degree to which use of an innovation perceived to enhance one's status in one's social system\" ({{Harvnb|Moore|Benbasat|1991}}<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Moore|first=Gary C.|last2=Benbasat|first2=Izak|date=1991-09-01|title=Development of an Instrument to Measure the Perceptions of Adopting an Information Technology Innovation|journal=Information Systems Research|volume=2|issue=3|pages=192\u2013222|doi=10.1287/isre.2.3.192|issn=1047-7047}}</ref>).\n* '''Job relevance''' \u2013 Venkatesh & Davis defined this as personal perspective on the extent to which the target system is suitable for the job ({{Harvnb|Venkatesh|Davis|2000}}).\n* '''Output quality''' \u2013 Venkatesh & Davis defined this as personal perception of the system's ability to perform specific tasks ({{Harvnb|Venkatesh|Davis|2000}}).\n* '''Result demonstrability''' \u2013 The production of tangible results will directly influence the system's usefulness ({{Harnvb|Moore|Benbasat|1991}}).\n\nIn an attempt to integrate the main competing user acceptance models, Venkatesh et al. formulated the [[unified theory of acceptance and use of technology]] (UTAUT). This model was found to outperform each of the individual models (Adjusted R square of 69 percent) ({{harvnb|Venkatesh|Morris|Davis|Davis|2003}}). UTAUT has been adopted by some recent studies in healthcare.<ref name=hf2010>{{Cite journal \n| last1 = Huser | first1 = V. \n| last2 = Narus | first2 = S. P. \n| last3 = Rocha | first3 = R.

The MPT model is fully described in her 1993 text ({{harvnb|Scherer|2005}}, 1st ed. 1993), \"Living in the State of Stuck\", now in its 4th edition. The MPT model has accompanying assessment measures used in technology selection and decision-making, as well as outcomes research on differences among technology users, non-users, avoiders, and reluctant users.\n# The [[HMSAM]]: TAM has been effective for explaining many kinds of systems use (i.e. [[e-learning]], [[learning management system]]s, [[webportal]]s, etc.) (Fathema, Sutton, 2013, Fathema, Shannon, Ross, 2015, Fathema, Ross, Witte, 2014). However, TAM is not ideally suited to explain adoption of purely intrinsic or hedonic systems (e.g., online games, music, learning for pleasure). Thus, an alternative model to TAM, called the hedonic-motivation system adoption model (HMSAM) was proposed for these kinds of systems by Lowry et al. ({{harvnb|Lowry|Gaskin|Twyman|Hammer|Roberts|2013}}). HMSAM is designed to improve the understanding of hedonic-motivation systems (HMS) adoption. HMS are systems used primarily to fulfill users' intrinsic motivations, such for online gaming, virtual worlds, online shopping, learning/education, online dating, digital music repositories, social networking, only pornography, gamified systems, and for general [[gamification]]. Instead of a minor TAM extension, HMSAM is an HMS-specific system acceptance model based on an alternative theoretical perspective, which is in turn grounded in flow-based cognitive absorption (CA). HMSAM may be especially useful in understanding gamification elements of systems use.\n# '''Extended TAM''': Several studies proposed extension of original TAM (Davis, 1989) by adding external variables in it with an aim of exploring the effects of external factors on users' attitude, behavioral intention and actual use of technology. Several factors have been examined  so far. For example, perceived self-efficacy, facilitating conditions, and systems quality  (Fathema, Shannon, Ross, 2015, Fathema, Ross, Witte, 2014). This model has also been applied in the acceptance of health care technologies.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Nadri |first1=Hamed |first2=Bahlol |last2=Rahimi |last3=Lotf nezhad afshar|first3 =Hadi|first4=Mahnaz|last4=Samadbeik|last5 =Garavand|first5 =Ali|title=Factors Affecting Acceptance of Hospital Information Systems Based on Extended Technology Acceptance Model: A Case Study in Three Paraclinical Departments\n|journal=Applied Clinical Informatics |volume=09|issue=2|pages=238\u2013247 |date=2018|doi=10.1055/s-0038-1641595 |pmid=29618139|pmc=5884692 }}</ref>\n\n==Criticisms==\nTAM has been widely criticised, despite its frequent use, leading the original proposers to attempt to redefine it several times. Criticisms of TAM as a \"theory\" include its questionable heuristic value, limited explanatory and predictive power, triviality, and lack of any practical value ({{harvnb|Chuttur|2009}}). [[Izak Benbasat|Benbasat]] and [[Henri Barki|Barki]] suggest that TAM \"has diverted researchers' attention away from other \nimportant research issues and has created an illusion of progress in knowledge accumulation. Furthermore, the \nindependent attempts by several researchers to expand TAM in order to adapt it to the constantly changing IT environments has lead{{sic}} to a state of theoretical chaos and confusion\" ({{harvnb|Benbasat|Barki|2007}}). In general, TAM focuses on the individual  'user' of a computer, with the concept of 'perceived usefulness', with extension to bring in more and more factors to explain how a user 'perceives' 'usefulness', and ignores the essentially social processes of IS development and implementation, without question where more technology is actually better, and the social consequences of IS use. Lunceford argues that the framework of perceived usefulness and ease of use overlooks other issues, such as cost and structural imperatives that force users into adopting the technology.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Lunceford|first=Brett|date=2009|title=Reconsidering Technology Adoption and Resistance: Observations of a Semi-Luddite|url=https://www.academia.edu/510375|journal=Explorations in Media Ecology|volume=8|issue=1|pages=29\u201347|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}</ref> For a recent analysis and critique of TAM, see Bagozzi ({{harvnb|Bagozzi|2007}}).\n\nLegris et al.<ref>Legris et al. 2003, p. 191.</ref> claim that, together, TAM and TAM2 account for only 40% of a technological system's use.\n\nBased on more fundamental models, Li <ref name=\"Li2020\">Li, Jerry  (2020), Blockchain technology adoption: Examining the Fundamental Drivers, ''Conference Proceedings, 2020 International Conference on Management Science and Industrial Engineering'',  https://doi.org/10.13140/RG.2.2.30288.25602 (preprint version)</ref> demonstrated that better predictive power can be achieved by proper initial screening. The results provide insights for research design under real business settings. \n\nPerceived ease of use is less likely to be a determinant of attitude and usage intention according to studies of telemedicine ({{harvnb|Hu|Chau|Sheng|Tam|1999}}), mobile commerce ({{harvnb|Wu|Wang|2005}}, and online banking ({{harvnb|Pikkarainen|2004}}). Li <ref name=\"Li2020\"/> also reported similar observations when investigating the adoption of Blockchain technology.\n\nA study conducted by Okafor, D. J., Nico, M. & Azman, B. B. (2016) discovered that perceived ease of use doesn't have any influence on the adoption of multimedia online technologies for Malaysian SMEs. The answers from the participants in this study suggest that, for them, perceived ease of use was not indicative of their behavioural intention to adopt multimedia online technologies (MOT) in the future. Instead of not adopting MOT, if they are complicated some participants said they are willing to learn it or practice more.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Diffusion (business)|Diffusion]]\n* [[Diffusion of innovations]]\n* [[Domestication theory]]\n* [[Lazy user model]]\n* [[List of marketing topics]]\n* [[New product development]]\n* [[Product life cycle management]]\n* [[Research and development]]\n* [[Technology adoption lifecycle]]\n* [[Technology lifecycle]]\n* [[Theory of planned behavior]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n* {{citation|last1=Adams|first1=D.

Both intelligence classification by observation of behavior outside the testing room and classification by IQ testing depend on the definition of \"intelligence\" used in a particular case and on the [[Reliability (psychometrics)|reliability]] and error of estimation in the classification procedure.\n\nThe English statistician [[Francis Galton]] made the first attempt at creating a standardized test for rating a person's intelligence. A pioneer of [[psychometrics]] and the application of statistical methods to the study of human diversity and the study of inheritance of human traits, he believed that intelligence was largely a product of heredity (by which he did not mean [[History of genetics#Post-Mendel, pre-re-discovery|genes]], although he did develop several pre-Mendelian theories of particulate inheritance).<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Bulmer |first1=M |year=1999 |title=The development of Francis Galton's ideas on the mechanism of heredity |url=|journal=Journal of the History of Biology |volume=32 |issue=3 |pages=263\u2013292 | doi = 10.1023/a:1004608217247 |pmid=11624207 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Cowan |first1=R.

(Fancher, 1985). Binet thought that intelligence was multifaceted, but came under the control of practical judgment.\n\nIn Binet's view, there were limitations with the scale and he stressed what he saw as the remarkable diversity of intelligence and the subsequent need to study it using qualitative, as opposed to quantitative, measures (White, 2000). American psychologist [[Henry H. Goddard]] published a translation of it in 1910.

Some test items are visual, while many are verbal. Test items vary from being based on abstract-reasoning problems to concentrating on arithmetic, vocabulary, or general knowledge.\n\nThe British psychologist [[Charles Spearman]] in 1904 made the first formal [[factor analysis]] of [[correlation]]s between the tests. He observed that children's school grades across seemingly unrelated school subjects were positively correlated, and reasoned that these correlations reflected the influence of an underlying general mental ability that entered into performance on all kinds of mental tests. He suggested that all mental performance could be conceptualized in terms of a single general ability factor and a large number of narrow task-specific ability factors. Spearman named it ''g'' for \"general factor\" and labeled the specific factors or abilities for specific tasks ''s''. In any collection of test items that make up an IQ test, the score that best measures ''g'' is the composite score that has the highest correlations with all the item scores. Typically, the \"''g''-loaded\" composite score of an IQ test battery appears to involve a common strength in abstract reasoning across the test's item content.\n\nSpearman's argument proposing a general factor of human intelligence is still accepted, in principle, to be the most important construct to intelligence by many psychometricians. Today's factor models of intelligence typically represent cognitive abilities as a three-level hierarchy, where there are a large number of narrow factors at the bottom of the hierarchy, a handful of broad, more general factors at the intermediate level, and at the apex a single factor, referred to as the ''g'' factor, which represents the variance common to all cognitive tasks.\n\n===United States military selection in World War I===\nDuring World War I, the Army needed a way to evaluate and assign recruits to appropriate tasks. This led to the development of several mental tests by [[Robert Yerkes]], who worked with major hereditarians of American psychometrics\u2014including Terman, Goddard\u2014to write the test.<ref name = Gould>{{cite book|last1=Gould|first1=Stephen Jay|title=The Mismeasure of Man (Revised and Expanded ed.)|date=1996|publisher=W.

Nonverbal or \"performance\" tests were developed for those who could not speak English or were suspected of malingering.<ref name=Kaufman2009/> Based on Goddard's translation of the Binet-Simon test, the tests had an impact in screening men for officer training:<blockquote>...the tests did have a strong impact in some areas, particularly in screening men for officer training. At the start of the war, the army and national guard maintained nine thousand officers. By the end, two hundred thousand officers presided, and two- thirds of them had started their careers in training camps where the tests were applied. In some camps, no man scoring below C could be considered for officer training.<ref name=\"Gould\" /></blockquote>1.75 million men were tested in total, making the results the first mass-produced written tests of intelligence, though considered dubious and non-usable, for reasons including high variability of test implementation throughout different camps and questions testing for familiarity with American culture rather than intelligence.<ref name = Gould /> After the war, positive publicity promoted by army psychologists helped to make psychology a respected field.<ref>{{cite book |first1=Carrie H. |last1=Kennedy |first2=Jeffrey A. |last2=McNeil |editor1-first=Carrie H. |editor1-last=Kennedy |editor2-first=Eric |editor2-last=Zillmer |year=2006 |chapter=A history of military psychology |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=rytCzdXGgXkC&pg=PA1 |title=Military Psychology: Clinical and Operational Applications |pages=1\u201317 |location= New York |publisher=Guilford Press |isbn=978-1-57230-724-7}}</ref> Subsequently, there was an increase in jobs and funding in psychology in the United States.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Katzell |first1=Raymond A. |last2=Austin |first2=James T. |year=1992 |title=From then to now: The development of industrial-organizational psychology in the United States |journal=Journal of Applied Psychology |volume=77 |issue=6 |pages=803\u201335 |doi=10.1037/0021-9010.77.6.803}}</ref> Group intelligence tests were developed and became widely used in schools and industry.<ref name=\"Kevles, D.

It gradually became more popular and overtook the Stanford-Binet in the 1960s. It has been revised several times, as is common for IQ tests, to incorporate new research. One explanation is that psychologists and educators wanted more information than the single score from the Binet. Wechsler's ten or more subtests provided this. Another is that the Stanford-Binet test reflected mostly verbal abilities, while the Wechsler test also reflected nonverbal abilities. The Stanford-Binet has also been revised several times and is now similar to the Wechsler in several aspects, but the Wechsler continues to be the most popular test in the United States.<ref name=Kaufman2009/>\n\n=== IQ testing and the Eugenics movement in the United States ===\n[[Eugenics]], the set of beliefs and practices which aims at improving the [[genetics|genetic]] quality of the [[human population]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/glossary=eugenics|title=Eugenics|work=Unified Medical Language System (Psychological Index Terms)|publisher=National Library of Medicine|date=26 September 2010}}</ref><ref name=\"Galton1904\">{{cite journal |author=Galton, Francis |authorlink=Francis Galton |date=July 1904 |title=Eugenics: Its Definition, Scope, and Aims |journal=The American Journal of Sociology |volume=X |issue=1 |accessdate=27 December 2010 |url=http://www.mugu.com/galton/essays/1900-1911/galton-1904-am-journ-soc-eugenics-scope-aims.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071103082723/http://galton.org/essays/1900-1911/galton-1904-am-journ-soc-eugenics-scope-aims.htm |archivedate=3 November 2007 |quote=Eugenics is the science which deals with all influences that improve the inborn qualities of a race; also with those that develop them to the utmost advantage. |bibcode=1904Natur..70...82.|pages=82, 1st paragraph |doi=10.1038/070082a0|doi-access=free }}</ref> played a significant role in the history and culture of the [[United States]] during the [[Progressive Era]], from the late 19th century until US involvement in [[World War II]].<ref name=\"SusanCurrell\">{{cite book|author1=Susan Currell|author2=Christina Cogdell|title=Popular Eugenics: National Efficiency and American Mass Culture in the 1930s|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WRL6MbBO024C&pg=PA86|year=2006|publisher=Ohio University Press|isbn=978-0-8214-1691-4|pages=2\u20133}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.princeton.edu/~tleonard/papers/retrospectives.pdf|title=Eugenics and Economics in the Progressive Era|language=en}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Eugenics in the United States|American eugenics movement]] was rooted in the [[Biological determinism|biological determinist]] ideas of the British Scientist [[Sir Francis Galton]].

[[Fluid intelligence]] (Gf) was hypothesized as the ability to solve novel problems by using reasoning, and [[crystallized intelligence]] (Gc) was hypothesized as a knowledge-based ability that was very dependent on education and experience. In addition, fluid intelligence was hypothesized to decline with age, while crystallized intelligence was largely resistant to the effects of aging. The theory was almost forgotten, but was revived by his student [[John L. Horn]] (1966) who later argued Gf and Gc were only two among several factors, and who eventually identified nine or ten broad abilities. The theory continued to be called Gf-Gc theory.<ref name=Kaufman2009/>\n\n[[John Bissell Carroll|John B. Carroll]] (1993), after a comprehensive reanalysis of earlier data, proposed the [[three stratum theory]], which is a hierarchical model with three levels. The bottom stratum consists of narrow abilities that are highly specialized (e.g., induction, spelling ability). The second stratum consists of broad abilities. Carroll identified eight second-stratum abilities. Carroll accepted Spearman's concept of general intelligence, for the most part, as a representation of the uppermost, third stratum.<ref name=Lubinski2004>{{cite journal |last1=Lubinski |first1=David |title=Introduction to the Special Section on Cognitive Abilities: 100 Years After Spearman's (1904) \"'General Intelligence,' Objectively Determined and Measured\" |journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology |date=2004 |volume=86 |issue=1 |pages=96\u2013111 |doi=10.1037/0022-3514.86.1.96 |pmid=14717630 |url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/45ed31078dced861e2a92a383813d1141aefc3d1 }}</ref><ref name=Carroll1993>{{Cite book |author=Carroll, J.B. |year=1993 |title=Human cognitive abilities: A survey of factor-analytic studies |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=New York |isbn=978-0-521-38712-5}}</ref>\n\nIn 1999, a merging of the Gf-Gc theory of Cattell and Horn with Carroll's Three-Stratum theory has led to the Cattell\u2013Horn\u2013Carroll theory (CHC Theory). It has greatly influenced many of the current broad IQ tests.<ref name=Kaufman2009/>\n\nIn CHC theory, a hierarchy of factors is used; ''g'' is at the top. Under it are ten broad abilities that in turn are subdivided into seventy narrow abilities. The broad abilities are:<ref name=Kaufman2009/>\n* [[Fluid intelligence]] (Gf) includes the broad ability to reason, form concepts, and solve problems using unfamiliar information or novel procedures.\n* [[Crystallized intelligence]] (Gc) includes the breadth and depth of a person's acquired knowledge, the ability to communicate one's knowledge, and the ability to reason using previously learned experiences or procedures.\n* Quantitative reasoning (Gq) is the ability to comprehend quantitative concepts and relationships and to manipulate numerical symbols.\n* Reading and writing ability (Grw) includes basic reading and writing skills.\n* Short-term memory (Gsm) is the ability to apprehend and hold information in immediate awareness, and then use it within a few seconds.\n* Long-term storage and retrieval (Glr) is the ability to store information and fluently retrieve it later in the process of thinking.\n* Visual processing (Gv) is the ability to perceive, analyze, synthesize, and think with visual patterns, including the ability to store and recall visual representations.\n* Auditory processing (Ga) is the ability to analyze, synthesize, and discriminate auditory stimuli, including the ability to process and discriminate speech sounds that may be presented under distorted conditions.\n* Processing speed (Gs) is the ability to perform automatic cognitive tasks, particularly when measured under pressure to maintain focused attention.\n* Decision/reaction time/speed (Gt) reflects the immediacy with which an individual can react to stimuli or a task (typically measured in seconds or fractions of seconds; it is not to be confused with Gs, which typically is measured in intervals of 2\u20133 minutes). See [[Mental chronometry]].\nModern tests do not necessarily measure all of these broad abilities. For example, Gq and Grw may be seen as measures of school achievement and not IQ.<ref name=Kaufman2009/> Gt may be difficult to measure without special equipment. ''g'' was earlier often subdivided into only Gf and Gc, which were thought to correspond to the nonverbal or performance subtests and verbal subtests in earlier versions of the popular Wechsler IQ test. More recent research has shown the situation to be more complex.<ref name=\"Kaufman2009\" /> Modern comprehensive IQ tests do not stop at reporting a single IQ score. Although they still give an overall score, they now also give scores for many of these more restricted abilities, identifying particular strengths and weaknesses of an individual.<ref name=\"Kaufman2009\" />\n\n===Other theories===\n[[J.P. Guilford]]'s [[J.P. Guilford#Guilford's Structure of Intellect|Structure of Intellect]] (1967) model used three dimensions which when combined yielded a total of 120 types of intelligence. It was popular in the 1970s and early 1980s, but faded owing to both practical problems and [[theoretical]] criticisms.<ref name=Kaufman2009/>\n\n[[Alexander Luria]]'s earlier work on neuropsychological processes led to the PASS theory (1997). It argued that only looking at one general factor was inadequate for researchers and clinicians who worked with learning disabilities, attention disorders, intellectual disability, and interventions for such disabilities. The PASS model covers four kinds of processes (planning process, attention/arousal process, simultaneous processing, and successive processing). The planning processes involve decision making, problem solving, and performing activities and requires goal setting and self-monitoring.\n\nThe attention/arousal process involves selectively attending to a particular stimulus, ignoring distractions, and maintaining vigilance. Simultaneous processing involves the integration of stimuli into a group and requires the observation of relationships. Successive processing involves the integration of stimuli into serial order. The planning and attention/arousal components comes from structures located in the frontal lobe, and the simultaneous and successive processes come from structures located in the posterior region of the cortex.<ref name=Das1975>{{Cite journal |author1=Das, J.P. |author2=Kirby, J. |author3=Jarman, R.F. |year=1975 |title=Simultaneous and successive synthesis: An alternative model for cognitive abilities |journal=Psychological Bulletin |volume=82 |pages=87\u2013103 |doi=10.1037/h0076163}}</ref><ref name=Das2002>{{Cite journal |author=Das, J.P. |year=2000 |title=A better look at intelligence |journal=Current Directions in Psychological Science |volume=11 |pages=28\u201333 |doi=10.1111/1467-8721.00162}}</ref><ref name= Naglieri1990>{{Cite journal |author1=Naglieri, J.A. |author2=Das, J.P. |year=2002 |title=Planning, attention, simultaneous, and successive cognitive processes as a model for assessment |journal=School Psychology Review |volume=19 |pages=423\u2013442}}</ref> It has influenced some recent IQ tests, and been seen as a complement to the Cattell-Horn-Carroll theory described above.<ref name=Kaufman2009/>\n\n==Current tests==\n[[File:IQ distribution.svg|thumb|upright=1.2|Normalized IQ distribution with mean 100 and standard deviation 15]]\nThere are a variety of individually administered IQ tests in use in the English-speaking world.<ref name=\"Urbina2011Table2.1\" /><ref name=\"FlanaganHarrison2012chs8-16\" /> The most commonly used individual IQ test series is the [[Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale]] for adults and the [[Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children]] for school-age test-takers.

E., Reise, S. P. (2000).''Item Response Theory for Psychologists''. New Jersey: Lawrence Erlbaum.</ref> DIF analysis measures such specific items on a test alongside measuring participants' latent abilities on other similar questions. A consistent different group response to a specific question among similar type of questions can indicate an effect of DIF. It does not count as differential item functioning if both groups have an equally valid chance of giving different responses to the same questions. Such bias can be a result of culture, educational level and other factors that are independent of group traits. DIF is only considered if test-takers from different groups ''with the same underlying [[Latent variable|latent]] ability level'' have a different chance of giving specific responses.<ref name=\":1\">{{cite journal | last1 = Zumbo | first1 = B.D. | year = 2007 | title = Three generations of differential item functioning (DIF) analyses: Considering where it has been, where it is now, and where it is going | url = https://semanticscholar.org/paper/3c3aae6697d1ae2bc605da14d54809d763c6a263| journal = Language Assessment Quarterly | volume = 4 | issue = 2| pages = 223\u2013233 | doi=10.1080/15434300701375832}}</ref> Such questions are usually removed in order to make the test equally fair for both groups.

In this model, the Flynn effect can be explained by an increase in environmental stimulation independent of it being sought out by individuals.

Several factors can lead to significant cognitive impairment, particularly if they occur during pregnancy and childhood when the brain is growing and the blood\u2013brain barrier is less effective. Such impairment may sometimes be permanent, sometimes be partially or wholly compensated for by later growth. {{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}\n\nSince about 2010, researchers such as Eppig, Hassel, and MacKenzie have found a very close and consistent link between IQ scores and infectious diseases, especially in the infant and preschool populations and the mothers of these children.<ref>Eppig. Christopher. Scientific American.\"Why is average IQ higher in some places?\" 2011.</ref> They have postulated that fighting infectious diseases strains the child's metabolism and prevents full brain development. Hassel postulated that it is by far the most important factor in determining population IQ. However, they also found that subsequent factors such as good nutrition and regular quality schooling can offset early negative effects to some extent.\n\nDeveloped nations have implemented several health policies regarding nutrients and toxins known to influence cognitive function. These include laws requiring fortification of certain food products and laws establishing safe levels of pollutants (e.g. [[lead]], [[Mercury (element)|mercury]], and organochlorides). Improvements in nutrition, and in public policy in general, have been implicated in worldwide IQ increases. {{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}\n\nCognitive epidemiology is a field of research that examines the associations between intelligence test scores and health. Researchers in the field argue that intelligence measured at an early age is an important predictor of later health and mortality differences.\n\n==Social correlations==\n\n===School performance===\nThe [[American Psychological Association]]'s report ''Intelligence: Knowns and Unknowns'' states that wherever it has been studied, children with high scores on tests of intelligence tend to learn more of what is taught in school than their lower-scoring peers. The correlation between IQ scores and grades is about .50. This means that the explained variance is 25%. Achieving good grades depends on many factors other than IQ, such as \"persistence, interest in school, and willingness to study\" (p.&nbsp;81).<ref name=\"Neisser95\" />\n\nIt has been found that the correlation of IQ scores with school performance depends on the IQ measurement used. For undergraduate students, the Verbal IQ as measured by WAIS-R has been found to correlate significantly (0.53) with the grade point average (GPA) of the last 60 hours (credits). In contrast, Performance IQ correlation with the same GPA was only 0.22 in the same study.<ref>{{cite book |last=Kamphaus |first=Randy W. |title=Clinical assessment of child and adolescent intelligence |publisher=Springer |year=2005 | isbn=978-0-387-26299-4}}</ref>\n\nSome measures of educational aptitude correlate highly with IQ tests{{snd}} for instance, Frey and Detterman (2004) reported a correlation of 0.82 between ''g'' ([[general intelligence factor]]) and [[SAT]] scores;<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Frey |first1=Meredith C. |last2=Detterman |first2=Douglas K. |title=Scholastic Assessment org? |journal=Psychological Science |volume=15 |issue=6 |pages=373\u20138 |year=2004 |pmid=15147489 |doi=10.1111/j.0956-7976.2004.00687.x|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/b5bdb12caffd662258f8515414efe2c096704188 }}</ref> another research found a correlation of 0.81 between ''g'' and [[General Certificate of Secondary Education|GCSE]] scores, with the explained variance ranging \"from 58.6% in Mathematics and 48% in English to 18.1% in Art and Design\".<ref name=Deary2007>{{Cite journal |last1=Deary |first1=I |last2=Strand |first2=S |last3=Smith |first3=P |last4=Fernandes |first4=C |title=Intelligence and educational achievement |journal=Intelligence |volume=35 |issue=1 |pages=13\u201321 |year=2007 |doi=10.1016/j.intell.2006.02.001}}</ref>\n\n===Job performance===\nAccording to Schmidt and Hunter, \"for hiring employees without previous experience in the job the most valid predictor of future performance is general mental ability.\"<ref name=\"Schmidt98\">{{cite journal |last1=Schmidt |first1=Frank L. |last2=Hunter |first2=John E. |title=The validity and utility of selection methods in personnel psychology: Practical and theoretical implications of 85 years of research findings |journal=Psychological Bulletin |volume=124 |issue=2 |pages=262\u201374 |year=1998 |doi=10.1037/0033-2909.124.2.262 |url=http://www.moityca.com.br/pdfs/SchmidteHunter1998.pdf |citeseerx=10.1.1.172.1733 |access-date=2017-10-25 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140602034440/http://www.moityca.com.br/pdfs/SchmidteHunter1998.pdf |archive-date=2014-06-02 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The validity of IQ as a predictor of [[job performance]] is above zero for all work studied to date, but varies with the type of job and across different studies, ranging from 0.2 to 0.6.<ref name=\"Hunter84\">{{cite journal |last1=Hunter |first1=John E. |last2=Hunter |first2=Ronda F. |title=Validity and utility of alternative predictors of job performance |journal=Psychological Bulletin |volume=96 |issue=1 |pages=72\u201398 |year=1984 |doi=10.1037/0033-2909.96.1.72|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/53dcb497dfbba0a23a9d247114379b5f3d920a1c }}</ref> The correlations were higher when the unreliability of measurement methods was controlled for.<ref name=\"Neisser95\" /> While IQ is more strongly correlated with reasoning and less so with motor function,<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Warner |first1=Molly |last2=Ernst |first2=John |last3=Townes |first3=Brenda |last4=Peel |first4=John |last5=Preston |first5=Michael |title=Relationships Between IQ and Neuropsychological Measures in Neuropsychiatric Populations: Within-Laboratory and Cross-Cultural Replications Using WAIS and WAIS-R |journal=Journal of Clinical and Experimental Neuropsychology |volume=9 |issue=5 |pages=545\u201362 |year=1987 |pmid=3667899 |doi=10.1080/01688638708410768}}</ref> IQ-test scores predict performance ratings in all occupations.<ref name=\"Schmidt98\"/> That said, for highly qualified activities (research, management) low IQ scores are more likely to be a barrier to adequate performance, whereas for minimally-skilled activities, athletic strength (manual strength, speed, stamina, and coordination) are more likely to influence performance.<ref name=\"Schmidt98\"/> The prevailing view among academics is that it is largely through the quicker acquisition of job-relevant knowledge that higher IQ mediates job performance.

A correlation of 0.20 means that the [[explained variance]] is 4%. The causal links between psychometric ability and social outcomes may be indirect.

However, in the case of [[Griggs v. Duke Power Co.]] in 1971, for the purpose of minimizing employment practices that disparately impacted racial minorities, the U.S. Supreme Court banned the use of IQ tests in employment, except when linked to job performance via a [[job analysis]]. Internationally, certain public policies, such as improving nutrition and prohibiting [[neurotoxins]], have as one of their goals raising, or preventing a decline in, intelligence.\n\nA diagnosis of [[intellectual disability]] is in part based on the results of IQ testing. [[Borderline intellectual functioning]] is a categorization where a person has below average cognitive ability (an IQ of 71\u201385), but the deficit is not as severe as intellectual disability (70 or below).\n\nIn the United Kingdom, the [[eleven plus exam]] which incorporated an intelligence test has been used from 1945 to decide, at eleven years of age, which type of school a child should go to. They have been much less used since the widespread introduction of [[comprehensive school]]s.\n\n==Criticism and views==\n===Relationship to intelligence===\n{{See also|Intelligence}}\nIQ is the most thoroughly researched means of measuring intelligence, and by far the most widely used in practical settings. However, while IQ strives to measure some concepts of intelligence, it may fail to serve as an accurate measure of broader definitions of intelligence. IQ tests examine some areas of intelligence while neglecting others such as [[creativity]] and [[social intelligence]].\n\nCritics such as [[Keith Stanovich]] do not dispute the reliability of IQ test scores or their capacity to predict some kinds of achievement, but argue that basing a concept of intelligence on IQ test scores alone neglects other important aspects of mental ability.<ref name=\"Neisser95\"/><ref>[[David Brooks (journalist)|Brooks, David]] (September 14, 2007).

In ''[[The Mismeasure of Man]]'' (1996), [[paleontologist]] [[Stephen Jay Gould]] criticized IQ tests and argued that they were used for [[scientific racism]]. He argued that ''g'' was a mathematical artifact and criticized:\n\n{{quote|...the abstraction of intelligence as a single entity, its location within the brain, its quantification as one number for each individual, and the use of these numbers to rank people in a single series of worthiness, invariably to find that oppressed and disadvantaged groups\u2014races, classes, or sexes\u2014are innately inferior and deserve their status.<ref>pp. 24\u201325</ref>}}\n\n[[Arthur Jensen]] responded:\n\n{{quote|...what Gould has mistaken for \"reification\" is neither more nor less than the common practice in every science of hypothesizing explanatory models to account for the observed relationships within a given domain.

They argue that just as [[swarm]]s change their collective behavior at certain thresholds of animals in the swarm, it is possible that brains change their abilities at thresholds of number of connected neurons and/or level of connectivity. Cecil Reynolds and  Paul Kline argue that such a bias may be the reason why IQ tests yield paradoxes such as the heredity paradox between high heredity showed by [[twin study|twin studies]] and the high environmental effect shown by the [[Flynn effect]] and suggest that other cognitive tests that do not conform to bell curve distributions should be tried with the possibility that some of them may produce [[falsifiability|falsifiable predictions]] of key abilities requiring a critical level of underlying quantitative brain access and simpler proxies of such in every case, unlike IQ tests which are argued to fail the falsifiability criterion by defining away problems by systematically demanding bell curves and failing to make any absolute system requirement predictions of what brain capacity is required to make a certain performance. It is argued that probabilistic predictions with loopholes for \"exceptions\" are not scientifically applicable to capacity theories, as capacities follow minimum system requirements for performing tasks.<ref>Cecil Reynolds Perspectives on Bias in Mental Testing book {{ISBN|978-1-4684-4658-6}} (2013)</ref><ref>Paul Kline The New Psychometrics: Science, Psychology and Measurement book {{ISBN|978-0415228213}} (2014)</ref>\n\n===Test bias===\nThe American Psychological Association's report ''Intelligence: Knowns and Unknowns'' stated that in the United States IQ tests as predictors of social achievement are not biased against African Americans since they predict future performance, such as school achievement, similarly to the way they predict future performance for Caucasians.<ref name=\"Neisser95\" /> While agreeing that IQ tests predict performance equally well for all racial groups, [[Nicholas Mackintosh]] also points out that there may still be a bias inherent in IQ testing if the education system is also systematically biased against African Americans, in which case educational performance may in fact also be an underestimation of African American children's cognitive abilities.<ref>{{Cite book |title=IQ and Human Intelligence |last=Mackintosh |first=N.

Uzzell and Harvey N. Switzky argue that defining IQ from an average at a period of time and putting different thresholds of what is considered retarded based on average IQ test performance in a culture faces issues of defining who belongs to what culture. They argue that since people are not actually in boxes of isolated cultures, essentialistic classification of culture that is said to make IQ tests \"culturally fair\" will show false \"evidence\" of underlying cognitive differences between individuals who are formally classified in the same culture but have faced different cultural non-shared environments due to the fluid intermingling of cultures in real life, making IQ tests a false measure of mental retardation. It is argued by Barbara P. Uzzell and Harvey N. Switzky that different social treatment depending on hereditary factors in appearance that may not necessarily be classified as \"racial\" but can often be considered individual leads to an appearance of genes for such appearances being linked to learned behaviors and false evidence of the genes affecting the brain's response to the environment, and that environmental differences in whether other people with whom a person speaks are willing to counter misunderstandings with factual arguments or dismisses the person as \"incapable of reasoning if he or she does not already know it\" [[self-fulfilling prophecy|creates differences in the opportunities to learn rules]] that can be used for solving problems in IQ tests and that widespread persistence of such cultural treatment gives a false appearance of IQ tests being reliable and valid measures of underlying cognitive abilities. It is argued that such effects of different opportunities to sharpen arguments through debate in all walks of life, including prejudice towards choice of words shaped by earlier differences in debate opportunities, make different predictions than lab setting only [[stereotype threat]] theory and must therefore be tested by different evidence than that theory, and that discrimination in society based on choice of words is a possible explanation of apparent links between IQ test performance and success in society.<ref>Barbara P.

The full text of the report is available through several websites.<ref name=\"Neisser95\" />\n\nIn this paper, the representatives of the association regret that IQ-related works are frequently written with a view to their political consequences: \"research findings were often assessed not so much on their merits or their scientific standing as on their supposed political implications\".\n\nThe task force concluded that IQ scores do have high predictive validity for individual differences in school achievement. They confirm the predictive validity of IQ for adult occupational status, even when variables such as education and family background have been statistically controlled. They stated that individual differences in intelligence are substantially influenced by both genetics and environment.\n\nThe report stated that a number of biological factors, including malnutrition, exposure to toxic substances, and various prenatal and perinatal stressors, result in lowered psychometric intelligence under at least some conditions. The task force agrees that large differences do exist between the average IQ scores of blacks and whites, saying:\n\n{{quote|The cause of that differential is not known; it is apparently not due to any simple form of bias in the content or administration of the tests themselves. The Flynn effect shows that environmental factors can produce differences of at least this magnitude, but that effect is mysterious in its own right.

There is even less empirical support for a genetic interpretation. In short, no adequate explanation of the differential between the IQ means of Blacks and Whites is presently available.}}\n\nThe APA journal that published the statement, ''[[American Psychologist]],'' subsequently published eleven critical responses in January 1997, several of them arguing that the report failed to examine adequately the evidence for partly genetic explanations.\n\n===Dynamic assessment===\nAn alternative to standard IQ tests originated in the writings of psychologist [[Lev Vygotsky]] (1896\u20131934) from his last two years of work.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Mindes|first1=Gayle|title=Assessing Young Children|date=2003|publisher=Merrill/Prentice Hall|isbn=9780130929082|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=x41LAAAAYAAJ|language=en|page=158}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Haywood|first1=H.

Those other forms of behavioral observation are still important for validating classifications based on IQ tests.\n\n==High IQ societies==\n{{Main|High IQ society}}\n\nThere are social organizations, some international, which limit membership to people who have scores as high as or higher than the 98th percentile (2 standard deviations above the mean) on some IQ test or equivalent. [[Mensa International]] is perhaps the best known of these. The largest 99.9th percentile (3 standard deviations above the mean) society is the [[Triple Nine Society]].\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Raven's Progressive Matrices]]\n* [[Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale]]\n* [[Woodcock\u2013Johnson Tests of Cognitive Abilities]]\n* [[Stanford\u2013Binet Intelligence Scales]]\n*[[IQ and Global Inequality]](2006 book)\n* [[Emotional intelligence|Emotional intelligence (EI)]], also known as emotional quotient (EQ) and emotional intelligence quotient (EIQ)\n\n==References==\n<!-- This article uses the citation templates described in [[User:RexxS/Cite_multiple_pages]].

Investigation of different patterns of increases in subtest scores can also inform current research on human intelligence.\n\n==History==\n{{see also|History of the race and intelligence controversy}}\n\n===Precursors to IQ testing===\nHistorically, even before IQ tests were devised, there were attempts to classify people into [[Human intelligence|intelligence]] categories by observing their behavior in daily life.<ref name=\"TermanOldClasses\" /><ref name=\"WechslerOldClasses\" /> Those other forms of behavioral observation are still important for validating classifications based primarily on IQ test scores. Both intelligence classification by observation of behavior outside the testing room and classification by IQ testing depend on the definition of \"intelligence\" used in a particular case and on the [[Reliability (psychometrics)|reliability]] and error of estimation in the classification procedure.\n\nThe English statistician [[Francis Galton]] made the first attempt at creating a standardized test for rating a person's intelligence. A pioneer of [[psychometrics]] and the application of statistical methods to the study of human diversity and the study of inheritance of human traits, he believed that intelligence was largely a product of heredity (by which he did not mean [[History of genetics#Post-Mendel, pre-re-discovery|genes]], although he did develop several pre-Mendelian theories of particulate inheritance).<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Bulmer |first1=M |year=1999 |title=The development of Francis Galton's ideas on the mechanism of heredity |url=|journal=Journal of the History of Biology |volume=32 |issue=3 |pages=263\u2013292 | doi = 10.1023/a:1004608217247 |pmid=11624207 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Cowan |first1=R.

(Fancher, 1985). Binet thought that intelligence was multifaceted, but came under the control of practical judgment.\n\nIn Binet's view, there were limitations with the scale and he stressed what he saw as the remarkable diversity of intelligence and the subsequent need to study it using qualitative, as opposed to quantitative, measures (White, 2000). American psychologist [[Henry H. Goddard]] published a translation of it in 1910.

Some test items are visual, while many are verbal. Test items vary from being based on abstract-reasoning problems to concentrating on arithmetic, vocabulary, or general knowledge.\n\nThe British psychologist [[Charles Spearman]] in 1904 made the first formal [[factor analysis]] of [[correlation]]s between the tests. He observed that children's school grades across seemingly unrelated school subjects were positively correlated, and reasoned that these correlations reflected the influence of an underlying general mental ability that entered into performance on all kinds of mental tests. He suggested that all mental performance could be conceptualized in terms of a single general ability factor and a large number of narrow task-specific ability factors. Spearman named it ''g'' for \"general factor\" and labeled the specific factors or abilities for specific tasks ''s''. In any collection of test items that make up an IQ test, the score that best measures ''g'' is the composite score that has the highest correlations with all the item scores. Typically, the \"''g''-loaded\" composite score of an IQ test battery appears to involve a common strength in abstract reasoning across the test's item content.\n\nSpearman's argument proposing a general factor of human intelligence is still accepted, in principle, to be the most important construct to intelligence by many psychometricians. Today's factor models of intelligence typically represent cognitive abilities as a three-level hierarchy, where there are a large number of narrow factors at the bottom of the hierarchy, a handful of broad, more general factors at the intermediate level, and at the apex a single factor, referred to as the ''g'' factor, which represents the variance common to all cognitive tasks.\n\n===United States military selection in World War I===\nDuring World War I, the Army needed a way to evaluate and assign recruits to appropriate tasks. This led to the development of several mental tests by [[Robert Yerkes]], who worked with major hereditarians of American psychometrics\u2014including Terman, Goddard\u2014to write the test.<ref name = Gould>{{cite book|last1=Gould|first1=Stephen Jay|title=The Mismeasure of Man (Revised and Expanded ed.)|date=1996|publisher=W.

Nonverbal or \"performance\" tests were developed for those who could not speak English or were suspected of malingering.<ref name=Kaufman2009/> Based on Goddard's translation of the Binet-Simon test, the tests had an impact in screening men for officer training:<blockquote>...the tests did have a strong impact in some areas, particularly in screening men for officer training. At the start of the war, the army and national guard maintained nine thousand officers. By the end, two hundred thousand officers presided, and two- thirds of them had started their careers in training camps where the tests were applied. In some camps, no man scoring below C could be considered for officer training.<ref name=\"Gould\" /></blockquote>1.75 million men were tested in total, making the results the first mass-produced written tests of intelligence, though considered dubious and non-usable, for reasons including high variability of test implementation throughout different camps and questions testing for familiarity with American culture rather than intelligence.<ref name = Gould /> After the war, positive publicity promoted by army psychologists helped to make psychology a respected field.<ref>{{cite book |first1=Carrie H. |last1=Kennedy |first2=Jeffrey A. |last2=McNeil |editor1-first=Carrie H. |editor1-last=Kennedy |editor2-first=Eric |editor2-last=Zillmer |year=2006 |chapter=A history of military psychology |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=rytCzdXGgXkC&pg=PA1 |title=Military Psychology: Clinical and Operational Applications |pages=1\u201317 |location= New York |publisher=Guilford Press |isbn=978-1-57230-724-7}}</ref> Subsequently, there was an increase in jobs and funding in psychology in the United States.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Katzell |first1=Raymond A. |last2=Austin |first2=James T. |year=1992 |title=From then to now: The development of industrial-organizational psychology in the United States |journal=Journal of Applied Psychology |volume=77 |issue=6 |pages=803\u201335 |doi=10.1037/0021-9010.77.6.803}}</ref> Group intelligence tests were developed and became widely used in schools and industry.<ref name=\"Kevles, D.

It gradually became more popular and overtook the Stanford-Binet in the 1960s. It has been revised several times, as is common for IQ tests, to incorporate new research. One explanation is that psychologists and educators wanted more information than the single score from the Binet. Wechsler's ten or more subtests provided this. Another is that the Stanford-Binet test reflected mostly verbal abilities, while the Wechsler test also reflected nonverbal abilities. The Stanford-Binet has also been revised several times and is now similar to the Wechsler in several aspects, but the Wechsler continues to be the most popular test in the United States.<ref name=Kaufman2009/>\n\n=== IQ testing and the Eugenics movement in the United States ===\n[[Eugenics]], the set of beliefs and practices which aims at improving the [[genetics|genetic]] quality of the [[human population]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/glossary=eugenics|title=Eugenics|work=Unified Medical Language System (Psychological Index Terms)|publisher=National Library of Medicine|date=26 September 2010}}</ref><ref name=\"Galton1904\">{{cite journal |author=Galton, Francis |authorlink=Francis Galton |date=July 1904 |title=Eugenics: Its Definition, Scope, and Aims |journal=The American Journal of Sociology |volume=X |issue=1 |accessdate=27 December 2010 |url=http://www.mugu.com/galton/essays/1900-1911/galton-1904-am-journ-soc-eugenics-scope-aims.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071103082723/http://galton.org/essays/1900-1911/galton-1904-am-journ-soc-eugenics-scope-aims.htm |archivedate=3 November 2007 |quote=Eugenics is the science which deals with all influences that improve the inborn qualities of a race; also with those that develop them to the utmost advantage. |bibcode=1904Natur..70...82.|pages=82, 1st paragraph |doi=10.1038/070082a0|doi-access=free }}</ref> played a significant role in the history and culture of the [[United States]] during the [[Progressive Era]], from the late 19th century until US involvement in [[World War II]].<ref name=\"SusanCurrell\">{{cite book|author1=Susan Currell|author2=Christina Cogdell|title=Popular Eugenics: National Efficiency and American Mass Culture in the 1930s|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WRL6MbBO024C&pg=PA86|year=2006|publisher=Ohio University Press|isbn=978-0-8214-1691-4|pages=2\u20133}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.princeton.edu/~tleonard/papers/retrospectives.pdf|title=Eugenics and Economics in the Progressive Era|language=en}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Eugenics in the United States|American eugenics movement]] was rooted in the [[Biological determinism|biological determinist]] ideas of the British Scientist [[Sir Francis Galton]].

[[Fluid intelligence]] (Gf) was hypothesized as the ability to solve novel problems by using reasoning, and [[crystallized intelligence]] (Gc) was hypothesized as a knowledge-based ability that was very dependent on education and experience. In addition, fluid intelligence was hypothesized to decline with age, while crystallized intelligence was largely resistant to the effects of aging. The theory was almost forgotten, but was revived by his student [[John L. Horn]] (1966) who later argued Gf and Gc were only two among several factors, and who eventually identified nine or ten broad abilities. The theory continued to be called Gf-Gc theory.<ref name=Kaufman2009/>\n\n[[John Bissell Carroll|John B. Carroll]] (1993), after a comprehensive reanalysis of earlier data, proposed the [[three stratum theory]], which is a hierarchical model with three levels. The bottom stratum consists of narrow abilities that are highly specialized (e.g., induction, spelling ability). The second stratum consists of broad abilities. Carroll identified eight second-stratum abilities.

It has greatly influenced many of the current broad IQ tests.<ref name=Kaufman2009/>\n\nIn CHC theory, a hierarchy of factors is used; ''g'' is at the top. Under it are ten broad abilities that in turn are subdivided into seventy narrow abilities. The broad abilities are:<ref name=Kaufman2009/>\n* [[Fluid intelligence]] (Gf) includes the broad ability to reason, form concepts, and solve problems using unfamiliar information or novel procedures.\n* [[Crystallized intelligence]] (Gc) includes the breadth and depth of a person's acquired knowledge, the ability to communicate one's knowledge, and the ability to reason using previously learned experiences or procedures.\n* Quantitative reasoning (Gq) is the ability to comprehend quantitative concepts and relationships and to manipulate numerical symbols.\n* Reading and writing ability (Grw) includes basic reading and writing skills.\n* Short-term memory (Gsm) is the ability to apprehend and hold information in immediate awareness, and then use it within a few seconds.\n* Long-term storage and retrieval (Glr) is the ability to store information and fluently retrieve it later in the process of thinking.\n* Visual processing (Gv) is the ability to perceive, analyze, synthesize, and think with visual patterns, including the ability to store and recall visual representations.\n* Auditory processing (Ga) is the ability to analyze, synthesize, and discriminate auditory stimuli, including the ability to process and discriminate speech sounds that may be presented under distorted conditions.\n* Processing speed (Gs) is the ability to perform automatic cognitive tasks, particularly when measured under pressure to maintain focused attention.\n* Decision/reaction time/speed (Gt) reflects the immediacy with which an individual can react to stimuli or a task (typically measured in seconds or fractions of seconds; it is not to be confused with Gs, which typically is measured in intervals of 2\u20133 minutes). See [[Mental chronometry]].\nModern tests do not necessarily measure all of these broad abilities. For example, Gq and Grw may be seen as measures of school achievement and not IQ.<ref name=Kaufman2009/> Gt may be difficult to measure without special equipment. ''g'' was earlier often subdivided into only Gf and Gc, which were thought to correspond to the nonverbal or performance subtests and verbal subtests in earlier versions of the popular Wechsler IQ test. More recent research has shown the situation to be more complex.<ref name=\"Kaufman2009\" /> Modern comprehensive IQ tests do not stop at reporting a single IQ score. Although they still give an overall score, they now also give scores for many of these more restricted abilities, identifying particular strengths and weaknesses of an individual.<ref name=\"Kaufman2009\" />\n\n===Other theories===\n[[J.P. Guilford]]'s [[J.P. Guilford#Guilford's Structure of Intellect|Structure of Intellect]] (1967) model used three dimensions which when combined yielded a total of 120 types of intelligence. It was popular in the 1970s and early 1980s, but faded owing to both practical problems and [[theoretical]] criticisms.<ref name=Kaufman2009/>\n\n[[Alexander Luria]]'s earlier work on neuropsychological processes led to the PASS theory (1997). It argued that only looking at one general factor was inadequate for researchers and clinicians who worked with learning disabilities, attention disorders, intellectual disability, and interventions for such disabilities. The PASS model covers four kinds of processes (planning process, attention/arousal process, simultaneous processing, and successive processing). The planning processes involve decision making, problem solving, and performing activities and requires goal setting and self-monitoring.\n\nThe attention/arousal process involves selectively attending to a particular stimulus, ignoring distractions, and maintaining vigilance. Simultaneous processing involves the integration of stimuli into a group and requires the observation of relationships. Successive processing involves the integration of stimuli into serial order. The planning and attention/arousal components comes from structures located in the frontal lobe, and the simultaneous and successive processes come from structures located in the posterior region of the cortex.<ref name=Das1975>{{Cite journal |author1=Das, J.P. |author2=Kirby, J. |author3=Jarman, R.F. |year=1975 |title=Simultaneous and successive synthesis: An alternative model for cognitive abilities |journal=Psychological Bulletin |volume=82 |pages=87\u2013103 |doi=10.1037/h0076163}}</ref><ref name=Das2002>{{Cite journal |author=Das, J.P. |year=2000 |title=A better look at intelligence |journal=Current Directions in Psychological Science |volume=11 |pages=28\u201333 |doi=10.1111/1467-8721.00162}}</ref><ref name= Naglieri1990>{{Cite journal |author1=Naglieri, J.A. |author2=Das, J.P. |year=2002 |title=Planning, attention, simultaneous, and successive cognitive processes as a model for assessment |journal=School Psychology Review |volume=19 |pages=423\u2013442}}</ref> It has influenced some recent IQ tests, and been seen as a complement to the Cattell-Horn-Carroll theory described above.<ref name=Kaufman2009/>\n\n==Current tests==\n[[File:IQ distribution.svg|thumb|upright=1.2|Normalized IQ distribution with mean 100 and standard deviation 15]]\nThere are a variety of individually administered IQ tests in use in the English-speaking world.<ref name=\"Urbina2011Table2.1\" /><ref name=\"FlanaganHarrison2012chs8-16\" /> The most commonly used individual IQ test series is the [[Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale]] for adults and the [[Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children]] for school-age test-takers.

A consistent different group response to a specific question among similar type of questions can indicate an effect of DIF. It does not count as differential item functioning if both groups have an equally valid chance of giving different responses to the same questions. Such bias can be a result of culture, educational level and other factors that are independent of group traits.

A variety of studies of IQ and aging have been conducted since the norming of the first Wechsler Intelligence Scale drew attention to IQ differences in different age groups of adults. Current consensus is that [[fluid intelligence]] generally declines with age after early adulthood, while [[crystallized intelligence]] remains intact. Both cohort effects (the birth year of the test-takers) and practice effects (test-takers taking the same form of IQ test more than once) must be controlled to gain accurate data.

In this model, the Flynn effect can be explained by an increase in environmental stimulation independent of it being sought out by individuals. The authors suggest that programs aiming to increase IQ would be most likely to produce long-term IQ gains if they enduringly raised children's drive to seek out cognitively demanding experiences.<ref name=\"DickensFlynn2001\">{{cite journal |last1=Dickens |first1=William T. |last2=Flynn |first2=James R. |title=Heritability estimates versus large environmental effects: The IQ paradox resolved. |journal=Psychological Review |volume=108 |issue=2 |pages=346\u201369 |year=2001 |pmid=11381833 |doi=10.1037/0033-295X.108.2.346|url=http://www.apa.org/journals/features/rev1082346.pdf |citeseerx=10.1.1.139.2436 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|first1=William T. |last1=Dickens |first2=James R. |last2=Flynn |url=http://www.brookings.edu/views/papers/dickens/20020205.pdf |title=The IQ Paradox: Still Resolved |journal=Psychological Review |volume=109 |issue=4 |year=2002 |doi=10.1037/0033-295x.109.4.764 |pages=764\u2013771 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070319031706/http://www.brookings.edu/views/papers/dickens/20020205.pdf |archivedate=2007-03-19 }}</ref>\n\n==Interventions==\nIn general, educational interventions, as those described below, have shown short-term effects on IQ, but long-term follow-up is often missing.

Several factors can lead to significant cognitive impairment, particularly if they occur during pregnancy and childhood when the brain is growing and the blood\u2013brain barrier is less effective. Such impairment may sometimes be permanent, sometimes be partially or wholly compensated for by later growth. {{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}\n\nSince about 2010, researchers such as Eppig, Hassel, and MacKenzie have found a very close and consistent link between IQ scores and infectious diseases, especially in the infant and preschool populations and the mothers of these children.<ref>Eppig. Christopher. Scientific American.\"Why is average IQ higher in some places?\" 2011.</ref> They have postulated that fighting infectious diseases strains the child's metabolism and prevents full brain development. Hassel postulated that it is by far the most important factor in determining population IQ. However, they also found that subsequent factors such as good nutrition and regular quality schooling can offset early negative effects to some extent.\n\nDeveloped nations have implemented several health policies regarding nutrients and toxins known to influence cognitive function. These include laws requiring fortification of certain food products and laws establishing safe levels of pollutants (e.g. [[lead]], [[Mercury (element)|mercury]], and organochlorides). Improvements in nutrition, and in public policy in general, have been implicated in worldwide IQ increases. {{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}\n\nCognitive epidemiology is a field of research that examines the associations between intelligence test scores and health. Researchers in the field argue that intelligence measured at an early age is an important predictor of later health and mortality differences.\n\n==Social correlations==\n\n===School performance===\nThe [[American Psychological Association]]'s report ''Intelligence: Knowns and Unknowns'' states that wherever it has been studied, children with high scores on tests of intelligence tend to learn more of what is taught in school than their lower-scoring peers. The correlation between IQ scores and grades is about .50. This means that the explained variance is 25%. Achieving good grades depends on many factors other than IQ, such as \"persistence, interest in school, and willingness to study\" (p.&nbsp;81).<ref name=\"Neisser95\" />\n\nIt has been found that the correlation of IQ scores with school performance depends on the IQ measurement used. For undergraduate students, the Verbal IQ as measured by WAIS-R has been found to correlate significantly (0.53) with the grade point average (GPA) of the last 60 hours (credits). In contrast, Performance IQ correlation with the same GPA was only 0.22 in the same study.<ref>{{cite book |last=Kamphaus |first=Randy W. |title=Clinical assessment of child and adolescent intelligence |publisher=Springer |year=2005 | isbn=978-0-387-26299-4}}</ref>\n\nSome measures of educational aptitude correlate highly with IQ tests{{snd}} for instance, Frey and Detterman (2004) reported a correlation of 0.82 between ''g'' ([[general intelligence factor]]) and [[SAT]] scores;<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Frey |first1=Meredith C. |last2=Detterman |first2=Douglas K. |title=Scholastic Assessment org? |journal=Psychological Science |volume=15 |issue=6 |pages=373\u20138 |year=2004 |pmid=15147489 |doi=10.1111/j.0956-7976.2004.00687.x|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/b5bdb12caffd662258f8515414efe2c096704188 }}</ref> another research found a correlation of 0.81 between ''g'' and [[General Certificate of Secondary Education|GCSE]] scores, with the explained variance ranging \"from 58.6% in Mathematics and 48% in English to 18.1% in Art and Design\".<ref name=Deary2007>{{Cite journal |last1=Deary |first1=I |last2=Strand |first2=S |last3=Smith |first3=P |last4=Fernandes |first4=C |title=Intelligence and educational achievement |journal=Intelligence |volume=35 |issue=1 |pages=13\u201321 |year=2007 |doi=10.1016/j.intell.2006.02.001}}</ref>\n\n===Job performance===\nAccording to Schmidt and Hunter, \"for hiring employees without previous experience in the job the most valid predictor of future performance is general mental ability.\"<ref name=\"Schmidt98\">{{cite journal |last1=Schmidt |first1=Frank L. |last2=Hunter |first2=John E. |title=The validity and utility of selection methods in personnel psychology: Practical and theoretical implications of 85 years of research findings |journal=Psychological Bulletin |volume=124 |issue=2 |pages=262\u201374 |year=1998 |doi=10.1037/0033-2909.124.2.262 |url=http://www.moityca.com.br/pdfs/SchmidteHunter1998.pdf |citeseerx=10.1.1.172.1733 |access-date=2017-10-25 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140602034440/http://www.moityca.com.br/pdfs/SchmidteHunter1998.pdf |archive-date=2014-06-02 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The validity of IQ as a predictor of [[job performance]] is above zero for all work studied to date, but varies with the type of job and across different studies, ranging from 0.2 to 0.6.<ref name=\"Hunter84\">{{cite journal |last1=Hunter |first1=John E. |last2=Hunter |first2=Ronda F. |title=Validity and utility of alternative predictors of job performance |journal=Psychological Bulletin |volume=96 |issue=1 |pages=72\u201398 |year=1984 |doi=10.1037/0033-2909.96.1.72|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/53dcb497dfbba0a23a9d247114379b5f3d920a1c }}</ref> The correlations were higher when the unreliability of measurement methods was controlled for.<ref name=\"Neisser95\" /> While IQ is more strongly correlated with reasoning and less so with motor function,<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Warner |first1=Molly |last2=Ernst |first2=John |last3=Townes |first3=Brenda |last4=Peel |first4=John |last5=Preston |first5=Michael |title=Relationships Between IQ and Neuropsychological Measures in Neuropsychiatric Populations: Within-Laboratory and Cross-Cultural Replications Using WAIS and WAIS-R |journal=Journal of Clinical and Experimental Neuropsychology |volume=9 |issue=5 |pages=545\u201362 |year=1987 |pmid=3667899 |doi=10.1080/01688638708410768}}</ref> IQ-test scores predict performance ratings in all occupations.<ref name=\"Schmidt98\"/> That said, for highly qualified activities (research, management) low IQ scores are more likely to be a barrier to adequate performance, whereas for minimally-skilled activities, athletic strength (manual strength, speed, stamina, and coordination) are more likely to influence performance.<ref name=\"Schmidt98\"/> The prevailing view among academics is that it is largely through the quicker acquisition of job-relevant knowledge that higher IQ mediates job performance.

However, in the case of [[Griggs v. Duke Power Co.]] in 1971, for the purpose of minimizing employment practices that disparately impacted racial minorities, the U.S. Supreme Court banned the use of IQ tests in employment, except when linked to job performance via a [[job analysis]]. Internationally, certain public policies, such as improving nutrition and prohibiting [[neurotoxins]], have as one of their goals raising, or preventing a decline in, intelligence.\n\nA diagnosis of [[intellectual disability]] is in part based on the results of IQ testing. [[Borderline intellectual functioning]] is a categorization where a person has below average cognitive ability (an IQ of 71\u201385), but the deficit is not as severe as intellectual disability (70 or below).\n\nIn the United Kingdom, the [[eleven plus exam]] which incorporated an intelligence test has been used from 1945 to decide, at eleven years of age, which type of school a child should go to. They have been much less used since the widespread introduction of [[comprehensive school]]s.\n\n==Criticism and views==\n===Relationship to intelligence===\n{{See also|Intelligence}}\nIQ is the most thoroughly researched means of measuring intelligence, and by far the most widely used in practical settings. However, while IQ strives to measure some concepts of intelligence, it may fail to serve as an accurate measure of broader definitions of intelligence. IQ tests examine some areas of intelligence while neglecting others such as [[creativity]] and [[social intelligence]].\n\nCritics such as [[Keith Stanovich]] do not dispute the reliability of IQ test scores or their capacity to predict some kinds of achievement, but argue that basing a concept of intelligence on IQ test scores alone neglects other important aspects of mental ability.<ref name=\"Neisser95\"/><ref>[[David Brooks (journalist)|Brooks, David]] (September 14, 2007).

In ''[[The Mismeasure of Man]]'' (1996), [[paleontologist]] [[Stephen Jay Gould]] criticized IQ tests and argued that they were used for [[scientific racism]]. He argued that ''g'' was a mathematical artifact and criticized:\n\n{{quote|...the abstraction of intelligence as a single entity, its location within the brain, its quantification as one number for each individual, and the use of these numbers to rank people in a single series of worthiness, invariably to find that oppressed and disadvantaged groups\u2014races, classes, or sexes\u2014are innately inferior and deserve their status.<ref>pp. 24\u201325</ref>}}\n\n[[Arthur Jensen]] responded:\n\n{{quote|...what Gould has mistaken for \"reification\" is neither more nor less than the common practice in every science of hypothesizing explanatory models to account for the observed relationships within a given domain. Well known examples include the heliocentric theory of planetary motion, the Bohr atom, the electromagnetic field, the kinetic theory of gases, gravitation, quarks, Mendelian genes, mass, velocity, etc. None of these constructs exists as a palpable entity occupying physical space.<ref>''Contemporary Education Review,'' 1982</ref>}}\n\nJensen also argued that even if ''g'' were replaced by a model with several intelligences this would change the situation less than expected. He argues that all tests of cognitive ability would continue to be highly correlated with one another and there would still be a black-white gap on cognitive tests.<ref name=\"jensen\">{{cite journal | author=Jensen Arthur | year=1982 | title=The Debunking of Scientific Fossils and Straw Persons | url=http://www.debunker.com/texts/jensen.html | journal=Contemporary Education Review | volume=1 | issue=2 | pages=121\u2013135 }}</ref> [[Hans Eysenck]] responded to Gould by stating that no psychologist had said that intelligence was an area located in the brain.<ref>Eysenck, Hans Intelligence: A New Look Transaction Publishers page 74</ref> Eysenck also argued IQ tests were not racist, pointing out that Northeast Asians and Jews both scored higher than non-Jewish Europeans on IQ tests, and this would not please European racists.<ref>Eysenck, Hans Intelligence: A New Look Transaction Publishers page 10</ref>\n\nPsychologist [[Peter Schonemann|Peter Sch\u00f6nemann]] persistently criticized IQ, calling it \"the IQ myth\".

They argue that just as [[swarm]]s change their collective behavior at certain thresholds of animals in the swarm, it is possible that brains change their abilities at thresholds of number of connected neurons and/or level of connectivity. Cecil Reynolds and  Paul Kline argue that such a bias may be the reason why IQ tests yield paradoxes such as the heredity paradox between high heredity showed by [[twin study|twin studies]] and the high environmental effect shown by the [[Flynn effect]] and suggest that other cognitive tests that do not conform to bell curve distributions should be tried with the possibility that some of them may produce [[falsifiability|falsifiable predictions]] of key abilities requiring a critical level of underlying quantitative brain access and simpler proxies of such in every case, unlike IQ tests which are argued to fail the falsifiability criterion by defining away problems by systematically demanding bell curves and failing to make any absolute system requirement predictions of what brain capacity is required to make a certain performance. It is argued that probabilistic predictions with loopholes for \"exceptions\" are not scientifically applicable to capacity theories, as capacities follow minimum system requirements for performing tasks.<ref>Cecil Reynolds Perspectives on Bias in Mental Testing book {{ISBN|978-1-4684-4658-6}} (2013)</ref><ref>Paul Kline The New Psychometrics: Science, Psychology and Measurement book {{ISBN|978-0415228213}} (2014)</ref>\n\n===Test bias===\nThe American Psychological Association's report ''Intelligence: Knowns and Unknowns'' stated that in the United States IQ tests as predictors of social achievement are not biased against African Americans since they predict future performance, such as school achievement, similarly to the way they predict future performance for Caucasians.<ref name=\"Neisser95\" /> While agreeing that IQ tests predict performance equally well for all racial groups, [[Nicholas Mackintosh]] also points out that there may still be a bias inherent in IQ testing if the education system is also systematically biased against African Americans, in which case educational performance may in fact also be an underestimation of African American children's cognitive abilities.<ref>{{Cite book |title=IQ and Human Intelligence |last=Mackintosh |first=N.

Uzzell and Harvey N. Switzky argue that defining IQ from an average at a period of time and putting different thresholds of what is considered retarded based on average IQ test performance in a culture faces issues of defining who belongs to what culture. They argue that since people are not actually in boxes of isolated cultures, essentialistic classification of culture that is said to make IQ tests \"culturally fair\" will show false \"evidence\" of underlying cognitive differences between individuals who are formally classified in the same culture but have faced different cultural non-shared environments due to the fluid intermingling of cultures in real life, making IQ tests a false measure of mental retardation. It is argued by Barbara P. Uzzell and Harvey N. Switzky that different social treatment depending on hereditary factors in appearance that may not necessarily be classified as \"racial\" but can often be considered individual leads to an appearance of genes for such appearances being linked to learned behaviors and false evidence of the genes affecting the brain's response to the environment, and that environmental differences in whether other people with whom a person speaks are willing to counter misunderstandings with factual arguments or dismisses the person as \"incapable of reasoning if he or she does not already know it\" [[self-fulfilling prophecy|creates differences in the opportunities to learn rules]] that can be used for solving problems in IQ tests and that widespread persistence of such cultural treatment gives a false appearance of IQ tests being reliable and valid measures of underlying cognitive abilities. It is argued that such effects of different opportunities to sharpen arguments through debate in all walks of life, including prejudice towards choice of words shaped by earlier differences in debate opportunities, make different predictions than lab setting only [[stereotype threat]] theory and must therefore be tested by different evidence than that theory, and that discrimination in society based on choice of words is a possible explanation of apparent links between IQ test performance and success in society.<ref>Barbara P.

The full text of the report is available through several websites.<ref name=\"Neisser95\" />\n\nIn this paper, the representatives of the association regret that IQ-related works are frequently written with a view to their political consequences: \"research findings were often assessed not so much on their merits or their scientific standing as on their supposed political implications\".\n\nThe task force concluded that IQ scores do have high predictive validity for individual differences in school achievement. They confirm the predictive validity of IQ for adult occupational status, even when variables such as education and family background have been statistically controlled. They stated that individual differences in intelligence are substantially influenced by both genetics and environment.\n\nThe report stated that a number of biological factors, including malnutrition, exposure to toxic substances, and various prenatal and perinatal stressors, result in lowered psychometric intelligence under at least some conditions. The task force agrees that large differences do exist between the average IQ scores of blacks and whites, saying:\n\n{{quote|The cause of that differential is not known; it is apparently not due to any simple form of bias in the content or administration of the tests themselves. The Flynn effect shows that environmental factors can produce differences of at least this magnitude, but that effect is mysterious in its own right. Several culturally based explanations of the Black/ White IQ differential have been proposed; some are plausible, but so far none has been conclusively supported. There is even less empirical support for a genetic interpretation. In short, no adequate explanation of the differential between the IQ means of Blacks and Whites is presently available.}}\n\nThe APA journal that published the statement, ''[[American Psychologist]],'' subsequently published eleven critical responses in January 1997, several of them arguing that the report failed to examine adequately the evidence for partly genetic explanations.\n\n===Dynamic assessment===\nAn alternative to standard IQ tests originated in the writings of psychologist [[Lev Vygotsky]] (1896\u20131934) from his last two years of work.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Mindes|first1=Gayle|title=Assessing Young Children|date=2003|publisher=Merrill/Prentice Hall|isbn=9780130929082|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=x41LAAAAYAAJ|language=en|page=158}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Haywood|first1=H.
